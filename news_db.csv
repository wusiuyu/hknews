案情透露，被告案發時負責向體院提交水球運動員的每月訓練紀錄作核實。被告在2018年1月至2021年9月期間，向體院報稱計劃下獲提名的水球港隊運動員，已出席訓練紀錄上訂明的所有訓練，體院因而向33名水球運動員發放津貼共41萬2000元。

廉署早前接獲有關水球港隊津貼發放的貪污投訴而展開調查，發現被告在製備水球港隊運動員每月訓練紀錄時，捏改相關訓練時數，以符合每月訓練出席率達8成，向體院申領每月津貼。調查又發現，被告要求運動員向他交出部分或全部津貼，涉及共約36萬元。"

This scrapping of talks raises questions about Nissan's future crisis management, as they are currently in a turnaround plan and have announced job cuts and capacity reductions.",2025-02-06 17:59,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1790552-20250206.htm,"Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida met with his Honda counterpart Toshihiro Mibe on Thursday to say he wanted to end their merger talks after the larger automaker proposed making Nissan a subsidiary, said a source with knowledge of the matter.

The Japanese automakers in December signed a memorandum of understanding to discuss an integration under a holding company to create the world's third largest automaker and compete in an increasingly tough industry.

But the talks have been complicated by growing differences, multiple people familiar with the matter have told international media, and hit a wall after Honda said it wanted to turn Nissan into a subsidiary.

""A consensus was reached (on Nissan's side) that the talks cannot proceed under that proposal,"" said the source with knowledge of the discussions.

Nissan will formalise the decision to withdraw from the MOU at a board meeting to be held before the company's third-quarter earnings announcement next week, the source added.

Honda's current stance is it would not accept an integration unless Nissan agrees to become a subsidiary, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported.

Honda is Japan's second-largest car maker behind Toyota, and Nissan is the third-largest.

Nissan and Honda spokespeople declined to comment on the status of their talks, repeating earlier statements that they aimed to finalise a future direction by mid-February.

A scrapping of the talks raises questions about how Nissan, which is in the middle of a turnaround plan, can ride out its latest crisis without external help. Nissan has already announced plans to cut 9,000 workers and 20 percent of global capacity. (Reuters)"

控方盤問黎智英，對於被告指他曾與法律助理陳梓華、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸於2020年1月在台北見面，談及組織勇武派領袖。黎智英供稱他在理大暴動後，產生建立勇武派領袖團隊的念頭，他在早前審訊時提到希望說服劉祖廸協助平息示威暴力，建立勇武派領袖團隊，以獲取更多國際支持。法官杜麗冰問被告是否想劉祖廸成為勇武派領袖，黎智英強調他並非推舉對方，只要求對方利用強大影響力，協助組織一個勇武派領袖團隊，以平息暴力，使行動更有組織。法官杜麗冰質疑被告首次作供提及此事時，沒有提到「影響力」一詞，黎智英同意他隨後的供詞是比較準確。

法官李運騰問被告是否知道劉祖廸的政治立場，黎智英說不知道，只知劉祖廸對勇武派有影響力。控方其後展示《蘋果日報》在2020年10月的報道，內容提到劉祖廸在2019年6月曾參與英國一場聲援香港反修例的集會。

控方又指出文章提到劉祖廸主力國際戰線，低調進行游說。黎智英同意劉祖廸的行動均是爭取國際支持，法官李運騰問被告於2020年1月與劉祖廸會面時，知否對方參與國際文宣，黎智英回答說他忘記當時對話，但認為對方當時或曾提及參與國際文宣的事情。控方指出，黎智英知道劉祖廸與「勇武派」無關，黎智英表示不同意。控方又指黎智英要求陳梓華接觸劉祖廸，就是想劉祖廸參與國際游說工作，黎智英否認，表示只想劉祖廸利用影響力建立勇武派領袖團隊。"

蔡若蓮出席啟動禮致辭時說，丘成桐在內地及香港深耕數十年，以數學為紐帶，構建香港、內地和國際學術界的合作網絡，這種紮根本土，胸懷天下的宏大格局，與香港背靠祖國，聯通世界的獨特優勢互相呼應。

蔡若蓮指出，學院採用8年制的學士博士課程，讓學生有更充裕時間聚焦在數學和應用領域的創新研究，學院亦會與內地及全球領先數學科學研究和教育中心加強合作，開展在基礎和應用數學、人工智能、大數據等研究，促進科學的應用和發展。她又說，學院的成立進一步擦亮香港教育的金字招牌，助力香港發揮成國際創科中心，推動教育強國建設，為中國式現代化貢獻力量。

中大校長盧煜明在致辭時就說，數學是很多學術的靈魂，包括物理、化學、醫學、甚至經濟學，數學人才對主宰一個國家的科學相當重要，因此需要培養頂尖數學人才，而丘成桐有創新理念，能物色數學專才，並訓練他們。

他又指，公司提供的免費接駁巴士需求大增，港珠澳大橋路線及關閘路線需求分別升1倍及近40%，公司亦有加密班次及增加備用車以應對。

啟德體育園3月1日正式開幕，被問到會否搶去澳門的演唱會等文娛項目，馬浩文不認為是「搶」，港澳旅遊應視為一個套餐，發展共同產業不存在競爭，反而可以互補，又指過往因為香港缺乏大型場館，巨星未有來港開演唱會。

提到泰國通過賭場合法化的法案，馬浩文指，泰國是已成熟旅遊目的地，博彩配套可令基本客源有更大保障，但他認為度假村式旅遊與博彩的關連性不大，治安問題亦很影響未來數年旅客對赴泰旅遊的印象。

另外，馬浩文提到，關稅、貿易戰只屬談判籌碼爭取經濟利益，他並不擔心，又認為中國的反制措施有效，否則港股及內地A股會崩盤。"

何咏前又指，中方將美國PVH集團、因美納公司列入不可靠實體清單，主要是有關公司違反正常的市場交易原則，中斷與中國企業的正常交易，對中國企業採取歧視性措施。

'Removal of de minimis exemption a blow for retailers',2025-02-06 15:35,"The White House has ended the de minimis exemption, allowing duty-free import of low-value packages under $800. This will impact small cross-border retailers, increase consumer costs, and complicate custom clearances. It may also affect Hong Kong's status as an international logistics center, particularly for e-commerce companies like Shein and Temu, and smaller shippers. Tariff hikes could also discourage brands from manufacturing in China, potentially impacting Hong Kong's logistics industry in the long term.",2025-02-06 17:46,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1790517-20250206.htm,"The scrapping of America’s de minimis exemption for the import of small goods will deal a blow to small cross-border retailers, increase burdens on consumers, while shaking Hong Kong's status as an international logistics centre, according to analysts and industry insiders.

On Monday, the White House announced it would end the de minimis exemption which allowed low-value packages, under US$800, to be shipped to America duty-free. 

The end of the exemption was a result of the additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods ordered by US President Donald Trump.

The removal of the exemption means that goods from Chinese retailers, especially e-commerce players like Shein and Temu, are now subject to the additional US duties on Chinese imports.

Speaking on a RTHK's Backchat programme on Thursday Alan Lung, political analyst and co-convenor of The Path of Democracy, said the removal of the exemption would affect the SAR as well as small mainland shippers.

""A lot of the small parcels that are shipped through e-traders, like Temu and Shein, are shipped through Hong Kong. The scrapping of the US$800 exemption simply increases the costs to consumers and makes it more complicated for custom clearances,"" he said.

""Companies like Alibaba are not really affected because their warehouses in the US, and they have their own customs clearances in blocks, it's the smaller shippers that will go bust,"" he added.

Platforms like Shein and Temu have become enormously popular in the US in recent years due to their budget-friendly products, and a US congressional report showed that over 80 percent of American e-commerce shipments in 2022 were from de minimis imports. 

Echoing Lung, Aditya Halan, Chief Technology Officer at Floship, an e-commerce and logistics service provider based in the SAR, said on the same programme that some logistics companies in the region have already increased their fees - due to the tariff changes and general business uncertainties.

""A lot is changing by the day. So everybody is trying to be secure... to put on a random block on the amount, and we commit as we pay back as actuals later on,"" he said.

Halan also warned that such tariff hikes could hinder the SAR's status as a global logistics centre in the long term, as brands look for ways to manufacture their products elsewhere, away from the mainland, to skip the tariff duties.

""If the brands start manufacturing outside China, the logistics will follow that trend as well, so many people will start setting up logistics hubs elsewhere, then there will be a risk for Hong Kong as a logistic centre.”"

US tariffs 'wrong' and must be rectified: Algernon Yau,2025-02-06 12:15,"Secretary Yau criticizes US for imposing 10% tariff on Chinese imports, including Hong Kong goods.

Yau also said higher US tariffs won't have much of an impact on the SAR, citing 2023 figures showing HK$6.1 billion worth of exports to the US represented only about 0.1 percent of the city's total exports.

“We can see that the impact on Hong Kong should not be huge,"" the commerce minister told an RTHK programme.

""But most importantly, the US ignored the fact that Hong Kong is a separate customs territory as stated in Article 116 of the Basic Law and recognised by the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

""The move by the US is very unreasonable and ignores the rules of an international organisation.""

Yau also said Hong Kong merchants have diversified supply chains and manufacturing locations, in view of the shift in the geopolitical landscape and international trade.

China has filed a complaint with the WTO over the tariffs, saying the actions by Washington are protectionist and break the trade body's rules.

Speaking on RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme, Tim Huxley, chairman of Mandarin Shipping, said the tariffs won't have a strong negative impact on the local shipping industry. 

""Hong Kong... is a significant shipowning centre, but it's also very much driven by shipping services. There’s a lot more to Hong Kong shipping than the container port, which is important. But when Hong Kong-owned ships are trading all over the world, they're carrying bulk cargoes, oil, as well as containers. So that will not have a huge impact.

""Hong Kong, remember, is very much now a service-driven economy... Maritime lawyers, bankers, insurance brokers, all these are the services that go on to make the shipping industry a large contributor to Hong Kong's economy,"" Huxley said."

丘應樺在本台節目《千禧年代》說，美國徵收關稅的安排，對香港的貿易，包括出口環境會造成影響，但強調香港商家早前已就地緣政治形勢及國際貿易的變局下作出改變，將供應鏈佈局及生產地分散，加上特區政府過去數年積極開拓新興市場，讓香港的企業走到其他經濟體發展商貿。事實上，香港出口到美國的貨品佔總出口量很低，估計總體影響不會很大。他以2023年的數字為例，香港出口去美國的貨物約值61億港元，佔香港總出口量大約0.1%。但最重要是美國無視香港作為單獨關稅區的地位，行為非常無理。

丘應樺又說，政府會密切留意情況，並研究美國的措施是否違反世貿規定，再作跟進。他提到香港貿發局和一帶一路辦公室會帶商會到中東及東南亞市場，尋求新的貿易夥件，並與不同經濟體，簽訂自貿協定，都是為開拓新市場，平衡負面影響。

對於美國郵政一度宣布，暫停接收來自中國內地和香港的入境國際包裹，之後表示會繼續接收。丘應樺說，香港郵政正積極處理問題，了解具體情況，包括包裹數量及美方的處理方法等，香港郵政會視乎實際情況作出適當安排，協助市民，香港郵政會盡快與美方溝通。"

"Nissan calls off Honda merger talks, Nikkei says",2025-02-06 06:01,"Nissan has decided to end merger talks with Honda, citing growing differences between the two companies. The potential tie-up, valued at over $60 billion, aimed to create the world's third-largest automaker. Nissan shares dropped while Honda shares rose, indicating investor relief. The move raises questions about Nissan's ability to drive its turnaround plan without external help, as it deals with its own crisis and potential US-Mexico tariffs.",2025-02-06 17:46,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1790418-20250206.htm,"Nissan is set to call off merger talks with rival Honda, a source said on Wednesday, abandoning a US$60 billion-plus tie-up that would have created the world's number 3 automaker and raising questions about how it will drive a turnaround by itself.

Talks have been complicated by growing differences between the two Japanese automakers, two people familiar with the matter, both of whom declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media, said earlier.

Nissan shares slid more than 4 percent on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which temporarily suspended trading in the stock after a Nikkei business daily report that it would pull out. Honda shares continued to trade and finished the day up more than 8 percent, in a sign of apparent investor relief.

The development will raise fresh questions about how hard-hit Nissan, which is in the middle of a turnaround plan and aims to cut 9,000 employees and 20 percent of global capacity, can ride out its latest crisis without external help.

Honda, Japan's second-largest car maker behind Toyota , and Nissan, its third-largest, said in December they were in talks to create the world's third-largest automaker by sales, bulking up in an industry facing a huge threat from China's BYD and other electric vehicle entrants.

Reuters reported earlier that Nissan could call off talks after Honda had sounded it out about becoming a subsidiary. Nissan baulked because this was a departure from what was originally framed as a merger of equals, one source said.

Nissan and Honda said in separate statements that the Nikkei report was not based on information announced by the companies and that they aimed to finalise a future direction by mid-February and announce it at that time.

Honda, whose market value of about 7.92 trillion yen (US$51.90 billion) is more than five times bigger than Nissan at 1.44 trillion yen, was increasingly worried about its smaller rival's progress on the turnaround plan, said a second source.

The tie-up talks have coincided with disruption posed by potential tariffs from US President Donald Trump. Tariffs against Mexico would be more painful for Nissan than for Honda or Toyota, analysts say.

""Investors may get concerned about Nissan's future (and) turnaround,"" said Morningstar analyst Vincent Sun, adding: ""Nissan also has a larger risk exposure to US-Mexico tariffs than Honda and Toyota."" (Reuters)"

The United States Postal Service announced on Tuesday that it was temporarily suspending inbound parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong until further notice.

Hongkong Post's website showed postal services regarding packets and parcels to the US were temporarily not available. But people could still mail letters to the country.

A woman at the General Post Office in Central said she was baffled by the arrangement.

""I'm sending a gift to my son in college. They said I can't send a package, I can only send a letter. I'm not happy. I'm going to try SF Express and DHL,"" she told RTHK.

Another woman said she wanted to send a card and a congratulatory gift after her friend in the US had a baby.

""They weren't sure why, what happened. They just said it's suspended for now. I'm going to find somewhere else and see if I can send it another way,"" she said.

RTHK reached out to various international shipping companies, and DHL's customer service office said it was still accepting packages to the US. 

But the company said guidelines are updated every half an hour and things may change. 

FedEx and UPS, meanwhile, said postal services were not affected, but it may take a longer time for parcels to arrive in the US.

The arrangement came after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods, and scrapped a duty-free exemption policy for low-value packages."

The confirmation came in a notice from US Customs and Border Protection.

The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Wednesday said the vast majority of goods from the SAR are now subject to the extra 10 percent tariffs, on top of regular and other potential extra duties.

Hong Kong is also affected by Washington's move to end the ""de minimis"" exemption that meant US shoppers didn't have to pay tariffs for shipments with a retail value of US$800 or less, the HKTDC said.

It noted that the US imported US$4.1 billion worth of goods from Hong Kong in 2023, with the duties paid totalling US$58 million.

""With the additional 10 percent duty in place, Hong Kong products would have faced US$411.6 million in additional duty liability in 2023, while mainland Chinese products would have faced US$42,081 million in additional duty liability,"" the HKTDC said.

The chairman of the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, Willy Lin, said he had been caught off-guard by Hong Kong's inclusion in the latest trade spat.

""Hong Kong customs and US customs do work very, very closely together to fight crime and fight drugs etc. We were quite surprised to see that Hong Kong was being labelled,"" Lin told RTHK.

""I think a 10 percent tariff is not really detrimental to Hong Kong, but it is reputation-wise,"" he said, adding that people will question why the SAR is being targeted.  

In announcing the extra tariffs, Trump said China needed to stop the flow of fentanyl, a deadly opioid, into the United States. 

Beijing has rejected accusations of complicity in the fentanyl trade and in response to Trump's move it has imposed tariffs of its own on multiple US products, while also announcing it would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization."

The ""upward revision incorporates progress in strengthening earning power, backed by improvement efforts including product competitiveness"", the company said.

The revision reflected efforts to strengthen its earnings power through keeping a lid on incentives, raising prices and stabilising production, Toyota said in presentation materials. It also expects to gain from a weak yen.

Toyota made the revision even though it posted weaker-than-expected earnings for the third quarter for which it booked its second successive quarterly profit decline.

Operating profit for the three months through December totalled 1.22 trillion yen, down 28 percent from a year earlier.

In recent quarters, Toyota's profit was pushed higher by strong hybrid vehicle demand in the US and other major markets.

By region, operating income in North America, which includes its top market by vehicle sales, the United States, fell by 63 percent over the first nine months of the financial year mainly due to a decrease in sales volume and higher personnel-related costs.

Operating income in China also declined during that period, pressured by higher marketing costs as the automaker sought to retain market share amid heavy competition from Chinese EV brands.

Toyota said it would establish a wholly owned company in Shanghai to develop and produce electric vehicles and batteries for its luxury Lexus brand, with production set to start in 2027 and have an initial capacity of around 100,000 units a year.

Last week, Toyota reported global group unit sales of 10.8 million vehicles for 2024, making it the world's best-selling automaker for a fifth successive year. (Agencies)"

Speaking on RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme on Wednesday, HKGCC CEO Patrick Yeung said the new tariffs would affect the region, as they could disrupt global supply chains.

""But in recent years, Hong Kong's exports have actually become very diversified, and the markets that Hong Kong exporters deal with has also been expanded,"" he said.

""So in this context, we believe that the Hong Kong export sector is already relatively prepared, at least psychologically, because President Trump has already said that there will be a tariff war, and it's just started right now.""

Yeung noted with the SAR expanding into new markets, particularly Asean and the Middle East, and achieving positive growth, it has partially helped offset the decline in trade due to the imposition of US tariffs.

Hunter Chan, Greater China economist at Standard Chartered, told the same show that compared to the previous trade war that took place during Trump's first presidency, Chinese exporters are more prepared this time round.

He expects the tariffs to cause a drop of about one percentage point in Chinese GDP in the coming 12 months.

The economist noted that some Chinese exporters to the US have relocated their factories overseas.

They have also re-exported to other places to avoid tariffs, he said.

Chan said while market sentiment remains cautious, investors are still hoping there will be positive results from any potential talks between Trump and President Xi Jinping."

Ada Ma, a council member of the institute, said these measures would boost the hotel and retail sectors and promote the new Kai Tak stadium. 

""Last year we talked about a lot of entertainers or sportspeople who went to Singapore or other countries to hold concerts. And there's some debate about why they don't come to Hong Kong,"" she said.

Trump later modified his weekend tariff announcement, suspending the levies on Mexico for 30 days following talks with his Mexican counterpart.

But all three major US indices still ended lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 0.3 percent to 44,421.91.

The S&P 500 fell 0.8 percent to 5,994.57, and the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 1.2 percent to 19,391.96.

The tariffs are ""considered a cost that will likely push prices higher and growth lower,"" said Jack Ablin of Cresset capital, who noted Trump has threatened tariffs on other countries.

""The market is adapting not just to more tariffs, but more headline risk,"" he said.

Monday's session underscored the greater exposure of some sectors to tariffs compared with others.

Among those falling were automakers like General Motors, down 3.2 percent, homebuilders such as Lennar, down 3.9 percent, and agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co., down two percent.

But the reaction in other sectors was muted. Companies in finance, insurance and telecommunications, either advanced or experienced small declines.

Apart from trade talks, key events this week include quarterly earnings from Google parent Alphabet and Ford, and US jobs data. (AFP)"
Hong Kong's economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2024,2025-02-03 18:10,"Hong Kong's economic growth slowed to 2.5% in 2024, matching forecasts but down from 3.2% in 2023. Q4 growth was 2.4%, faster than Q3. Growth expected in 2025 despite external uncertainties. Stimulus measures and supportive policies helped, but retail sales and investment dropped. Annual growth expected to swing between 2-4% as property sector stabilizes.",2025-02-06 17:46,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1790114-20250203.htm,"Hong Kong's economic growth slowed to 2.5 percent in 2024, officials said on Monday.

The figure matched government forecasts, but was down from the 3.2 percent growth recorded in 2023.

Figures from the Census and Statistics Department showed a relatively faster pace of growth in the last quarter of 2024 – at 2.4 percent year-on-year – compared to 1.9 percent in the third quarter.

Looking ahead, a government spokesperson said the economy is expected to register further growth in 2025, despite heightened uncertainties in the external environment.

The spokesperson said while US ""protectionist policies"" could affect Hong Kong's exports, supportive measures from Beijing will help offset some of the impact and the authorities will continue to take various measures to spur growth. 
 
Terence Chong, an economics professor at Chinese University, said the city's latest growth was partially driven by stimulus measures from Beijing last September, as well as supportive policies in Chief Executive John Lee's Policy Address last October.

""The fourth quarter performance was actually much better than the third quarter's, basically it was driven by the exports of services and also by the government expenditure,"" he said.

""But if you look at the consumption and also investment, they dropped."" 

Chong said falling retail sales are among the most concerning components weighing on the SAR's growth.

""Looking ahead, we may [also] expect some reductions in the export sectors, because of the trade tensions between the US and other economies like China,"" he added.

Chong said he expects Hong Kong's annual economic growth to swing between two and four percent in the coming year, as a declining property sector gradually stabilises due to interest rate cuts boosting transaction volumes.

""I would say that the property markets have reached the bottom and the sector will bounce back in the first half of 2025,"" he said, adding that the city's stock markets are also picking up steam."
Retail sales drop for 10th consecutive month,2025-02-03 18:00,"Retail sales decreased 9.7% in December compared to the previous year, marking the 10th consecutive month of declines.

According to figures from the Census and Statistics Department released on Monday, the value of total retail sales in December was estimated at HK$32.8 billion.

The decrease followed a revised 7.3 percent fall in November.

Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw a sharp decline of 36.3 percent, while those of furniture and fixtures saw a 22 percent fall.

A government spokesman said retail sales declined further in December, partly due to more Hong Kong residents travelling abroad during the holidays.

Meanwhile, the provisional data showed retail sales for the whole of 2024 decreased by 7.3 percent when compared with the previous year.

""The near-term performance of the retail sector would continue to be affected by the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents,"" a government spokesman said. 

But it said the retail sector would benefit due to various measures introduced by the central government and proactive efforts by the SAR authorities to promote tourism, boost market sentiment and increase employment earnings.

Bond Law, the executive director of the Retail Management Association, said while the sector is expecting a continuous decline in business for January and February, there is some cause for optimism.

""There is hope for the increased business from mainland tourists, especially with the resumption of the multiple-entry individual visit scheme for Shenzhen residents,"" he said.

""Members are observing changes in tourist foot traffic, spending patterns and basket sizes. While foot traffic may increase, purchasing power remains weak and we need time to see the foot effects."""

Markets grapple with fallout from Trump's trade war,2025-02-03 13:55,"Investors sold stocks and bought dollars due to trade war fears after Trump announced tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China. Markets had assumed Trump was bluffing, but the tariffs, set to begin Tuesday, have jolted markets. The selloff impacted various assets, including cryptocurrencies and the Japanese yen. Trump linked the tariffs to immigration and drug issues, but China and Mexico said it's America's problem. Markets expect volatility and potential retaliation.",2025-02-06 17:46,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1790078-20250203.htm,"Investors bought dollars, sold stocks and fretted about inflation on Monday in a scramble to assess the risk of a trade war after Donald Trump put tariffs on top US trading partners.

Trump's orders for additional levies of 25 percent on imports from Mexico and most goods from Canada, as well as 10 percent on goods from China are light on detail. 

But they kick in on Tuesday and have jolted markets that had assumed Trump was mostly bluff and bluster.

The selloff extended beyond just Canadian and Mexican markets and stocks directly in the line of fire, to cryptocurrencies, stocks and even the safe-haven Japanese yen, as investors tried to second-guess the volatile president's next moves.

Worries about the hit to growth from the inflationary impact of the wide-ranging tariffs and the uncertainty that creates for the Federal Reserve played a part, causing everything but the dollar and long-term US Treasuries to be sold.

""Trump's trade war has started,"" said Alvin Tan, head of Asia currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Singapore, noting it was hard to see the US dollar retreating any time soon.

The dollar has been the main mover, gaining as Trump headed for and then won office because investors figured tariff-hit countries would weaken their currencies to offset the impact.

On Monday, the euro fell 1.3 percent on fears Europe may be next on the tariff list.

Canada's dollar skidded to a 20-year low on the greenback, China's yuan slid in offshore trade, oil jumped, metals slumped and US equity futures dropped about two percent on risks to US companies' bottom lines.

Trump said the tariffs may cause ""short term"" pain for Americans, and while he would speak on Monday with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, which have announced retaliatory tariffs of their own, he downplayed expectations that they would change his mind.

Analysts said equity bulls are re-evaluating their Trump trades.

""Equity bulls seduced by 'Trump is good for equities' narrative are subject to a rude wake-up call from the potentially jarring impact on growth/earnings amid retaliatory tariff spirals,"" Mizuho said.

Shares in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul and Taipei made losses around two percent in the morning. 

European stock futures slid 2.8 percent.

Trump has linked the tariffs to the flow of migrants and drugs - particularly fentanyl - into the US and demanded crackdowns in Canada, China and Mexico.

China and Mexico have said fentanyl is America's problem, so prospects of a breakthrough are unclear.

Beijing said it would challenge Trump's tariffs at the World Trade Organisation and take unspecified countermeasures. (Reuters)"

Trump said he would be putting tariffs on imports of computer chips to the United States, which will punish Nvidia's business that depends on imported components, mainly from Taiwan.

""It was a good meeting, but eventually we're going to put tariffs on chips,"" Trump told reporters afterwards.

High-end versions of Nvidia's chips face US export restrictions to the major market of China.

That policy came under scrutiny this week when Chinese startup DeepSeek achieved widespread adoption of its latest AI model that was developed without access to Nvidia's export-blocked H100 chips.

After the DeepSeek breakthrough, US media reported that the Trump administration was exploring ways to expand the restrictions to Nvidia's lower end chips.

The DeepSeek model triggered a plunge in Nvidia's stock Monday, wiping out nearly US$600 billion in market value -- Wall Street's largest single-day loss ever.

""We appreciated the opportunity to meet with President Trump and discuss semiconductors and AI policy,"" an Nvidia spokesperson said.

""Jensen and the president discussed the importance of strengthening US technology and AI leadership.""

Huang, whose company has become one of the world's most valuable firms on the back of the AI frenzy, was notably absent from Trump's January 20 inauguration.

US equities had spent much of the day in the black after Apple results and US inflation data that met expectations.

But in a briefing on Friday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said tariffs against the three US trading partners would be imposed on Saturday, adding: ""These are promises made and promises kept by the president.""

""The tariff talk in the afternoon injected a new wave of uncertainty,"" Briefing.com's Patrick O'Hare told AFP.

""We think it just kind of proved to be a bit of a trigger for people to take some money off the table going into the weekend,"" he said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.8 percent at 44,544.66, the S&P 500 lost 0.5 percent to finish at 6,040.53 and the Nasdaq Composite eased 0.3 percent to 19,627.44. 

AI-related stocks, particularly key chipmaker Nvidia, had plunged early in the week after China's DeepSeek unveiled an artificial intelligence model rivalling those of American tech giants but developed at a fraction of the cost.

Markets later clawed back most of those losses thanks to encouraging earnings and company strategy updates, and as some investors re-evaluated the risks US firms face from Chinese competition.

Financial markets also digested the latest US inflation data, with the Federal Reserve's favourite inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, accelerating for a third month in a row, reaching 2.6 percent in December as expected.

""While there's still further progress to be made on inflation, investors can breathe a sigh of relief and refocus on the market's more notable fundamentals, like earnings growth and the economy,"" said Bret Kenwell, US investment analyst at the eToro trading platform.

Earlier, London's benchmark FTSE 100 hit fresh highs, helped by an almost 12 percent surge in the share price of Smiths Group after the British engineering company said it planned to streamline its business and return substantial sums to shareholders.

Paris and Frankfurt ended little changed as early rises fizzled. European stocks had one of their best months in two years in January with Europe-wide indexes rising six percent since the start of 2025.

Data showed German inflation unexpectedly slowed in January, the first decline in months, bolstering the case for further rate cuts by the European Central Bank.

The ECB cut rates on Thursday, its fifth reduction since June.

Concerns over Trump's trade tactics pushed gold to new records above US$2,800 an ounce.

""The gold price is proving its haven credentials, as investors choose it to hedge fears about Trump's tariff threats,"" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.  (AFP)"
