In newspaper interviews published on Monday, Lam said individuals under investigation for their acts during the social unrest were not bound by any restrictions, and could exercise their freedoms like anyone else.

The justice chief shot down calls to stop pursuing suspects after a certain period of time, clarifying there's no time limit on prosecution for ""serious criminal cases"".

Setting a deadline, he added, would be ""inconsistent"" with the principle of the rule of law.

""Our decision to prosecute is based on existing evidence. But there were instances in the past...where there could be changes in circumstances or the emergence of new evidence in the future that's unknown to us, which might make it necessary to re-examine the prosecution decision,"" Lam explained.

His views were echoed by security minister Chris Tang, who was asked the same topic in a media interview on Monday.

Dropping prosecution after a certain period of time, he said, was like ""making things that are illegal lawful"".

""Unless the law stipulates a time limit, we will initiate prosecution when there's evidence,"" Tang said.

上月出口按年升4.7%，升幅比8月收窄1.7個百分點。進口按年升1.4%，升幅收窄6.5個百分點。上月有形貿易逆差532億元，相當於商品進口貨值的11.8%。

首9個月出口按年升10.7%，進口升7.1%，有形貿易逆差2700億元。第3季出口按季跌2.3%，進口升1.8%。

政府發言人表示，上月出口持續增長，輸往內地及歐盟的出口進一步上升，對美國出口則回落，輸往多個主要亞洲市場出口亦有不同程度跌幅。貿易摩擦升溫及環球經濟不明朗，可能持續影響香港出口表現，但內地經濟前景改善，應會提供一些支持。"

鄧炳強說，維護國家安全條例今年3月才通過，對一般人員來說是新事物， 未必充分掌握在日常工作如何體現。他表示，指引對涉及政策的人員來說考慮較大，對例如涉及屋宇維修工作的人員就關係未必太大，但不會只對某職別人員才適合，強調指引是為了指導及協助同事工作，細則中並無罰則，懲罰並非政策目標。

另外，當局提出要加強反恐準備，將在今年底前引入三層防範機制。鄧炳強說，觀乎目前國際形勢，以及現時相關工作只由執法部門主導，措施是為了加強防範及準備工作，不認同會架床疊屋，只會令效率提升。

他表示，將設立行政長官反恐督導組，將統籌整個政府內的相關工作，訂立整體政策方向，每年至少召開一次會議，另外保安局局長會主持反恐統籌組，轄下將設不同專責小組包括情報，利用科技，社會處理及出入境管控等方面，至少每半年開一次會，期望將預防工作做得更好，由於涉及反恐工作，內容不會對外公開。

被問到這份施政報告在國家安全的篇幅較往年少，鄧炳強表示，要整體閱讀報告內容，不應以字數衡量，特首有提及安全和發展是鳥之兩翼，是盡在不言中。"

Its chief executive Eddie Yue said officials are working with their mainland counterparts on the details, and a trial scheme could kick off in the middle of next year. 

On the sidelines of the Hong Kong Fintech Week, Yue told reporters that cross-border transfers could be done around the clock and could be made to an account that is linked with a mainland phone number, much like how FPS operates.

Separately, the Securities and Futures Commission said it will consult the trade early next year in creating the roadmap for a new regulatory regime for virtual asset trading platforms.

Currently, three such licences have been approved, with the commission saying it is processing more applications.

The SFC’s intermediaries executive director, Eric Yip, said all licensees will be invited to take part in the consultative panel.

""We expect the panel deliberation will result in a comprehensive virtual assets white paper that outlines the development roadmap for products and services, as well as potential enhancement in compliance and risk management,"" he said in his speech at Fintech Week.

""Next is our work to piece the rest of the regulatory regime puzzle. To establish a comprehensive framework for virtual assets, we should make reference to how trading, settlement, and custody work in the traditional securities market.""

Yip added that the commission will step up investor education regarding virtual assets, as well as its monitoring of suspicious platforms and alerting investors of potential harm."

Hostel tenants will be asked to take part in 200 hours of activities each year, such as training courses and trips to other parts of the Greater Bay Area. 

Henry Cheng, who chairs the organisation’s board of directors, said on Monday that tenants can choose what activities to join.

“The goal to organise these activities is to broaden their horizon and for their personal development,” he said. 

“National education is just one of them. We are looking to take them to the Greater Bay Area, to different enterprises, to let them know how the country has changed, as China has grown quite substantially for the last 10 years.”

Employed individuals who meet the income and asset requirements can make single-person applications to be matched with a roommate, or apply as a pair for the same unit. 

The total monthly rent of a room ranges from HK$9,000 to HK$9,300.

As of 4pm on Monday, the project had received about 110 applications, according to the charitable organisation.

The youth hostel will initially run for three years, with tenants signing a two-year contract."

以往國泰亦曾推出飛往利雅得的直航航線，但2017年已停辦，相隔7年再次復辦。劉凱詩指，當年時機未成熟，但經過市場研究後，認為隨著近年的資金流向及觀光客的需求，現時正值重推航線的好時機，未來亦會密切留意需求，如果反應理想，會再加密班次。

有乘客表示，有家人在利雅得工作，在當地出了意外，需要飛到當地探望，今早才臨時購買機票。她說，以往要到當地，需要從廣州飛或中途轉機，適逢利雅得直航航班復辦，航程由超過14小時縮短至10小時，大大提升便利性，日後可更頻繁去探望家人，亦會考慮到沙特阿拉伯旅遊。

有本地科技初創企業代表乘搭首航航班到利雅得，負責人吳先生說，已經是第二次去當地，上次要經卡塔爾轉機，但今次可以直達，明日就可以開會，節省時間，他的公司未來希望開拓中東市場，認為有往來香港及利雅得的直航航線，方便未來的工作行程。"

陳茂波說，代表團在中東期間會出席「未來投資倡議大會」，藉此機會進行多方面會談，金管局將與沙特阿拉伯主權基簽署合作協議；科技園也有合作協議簽署；來自香港的初創企業也會跟當地合作顆伴，簽署合作協議。他期望今次訪問加深與中東的往來，開拓中東市場、新的資金來源，擴闊香港朋友圈，推動雙方經貿往來。

被問到中東局勢緊張會否影響投資，陳茂波說，中東地緣政治局勢緊張，同時也出現了機遇，當地投資者往以投資美國及歐洲為主，現在他們除了看好亞洲區有更好的回報，很多當地投資者也想分散投資，因此推動他們也更有興趣來港，今次港投公司管理層也一同出發，會探討更深入合作。

當局表示，沙螺灣相控陣天氣雷達的最大覆蓋範圍約為60公里，未能覆蓋整個香港；而且購置三台相控陣天氣雷達，有助落實大灣區氣象發展規劃，促進天文台與廣東省各氣象部門交換數據和產生協同效應。

在立法會環境事務委員會會議上，環境及生態局局長謝展寰說，今年施政報告提出發展低空經濟，相控陣天氣雷達網絡的掃瞄範圍可低至數百米的低空空域，有助監測低空天氣狀況，為無人機等提供氣象資訊，確保低空飛行安全，打造低空氣象基礎建設，促進低空經濟的發展。

議員普遍支持建議，不過經民聯的陸瀚民關注，新添置的相控陣天氣雷達如何有助預測局部惡劣天氣，又說「電離層閃爍」會影響無人機運作，關注天文台如何監測太空天氣。

天文台助理台長陳世倜表示，當局建議添置的相控陣天氣雷達，解像度更高、更新頻率更快，有助更清晰觀察到香港及鄰近地區的強對流天氣發展，天文台又計劃將相關數據在網站或「我的天文台」應用程式發放。

至於「電離層閃爍」現象，陳世倜說，天文台有參考內地或外國的空間天氣數據，並正檢視有何手段監測電離層的變化，能否提供數據給公眾或相關持份者參考。"

房屋局發言人表示，在總房屋供應目標440000個單位中，公營房屋供應目標為308000個單位，私營房屋供應目標為132000個單位。在未來10年，政府已覓得足夠土地，可滿足公營房屋單位供應目標。在規劃公營房屋發展時會保持彈性，確保可以因應實際情況轉變而適時作出相應調整。
 
私營房屋供應方面，政府未來5年會準備好可通過賣地及鐵路物業發展，提供可興建約80000個單位的土地；加上市區重建局和其他私人土地發展項目，將可滿足132000個單位的私營房屋供應目標。至於較短期的供應，根據今年9月底的最新推算，未來3至4年，一手私人住宅物業市場的供應量預計約為108000個單位。
 
發言人又說，近年公屋/綠置居與其他資助出售單位的比例維持在70:30。正如施政報告宣布，房委會將以邁向60:40的比例作為規劃基礎。房委會亦會檢視相關政策，滿足青年的置業需求，包括為白表青年家庭及一人申請者分派多一個抽籤號碼；增加「白表居屋第二市場計劃」的配額，並為青年申請者設立專屬配額；優化抽籤安排，增加屢次向隅者成功購買資助出售單位的機會。

另外，房委會採取措施全方位打擊濫用公屋。房委會將會加強與內地部門或機構溝通，以便獲取租戶有關擁有內地物業的資料，以採取適切跟進行動，又會推出「善用公屋資源獎勵計劃」，為提供確切情報舉報濫用公屋的舉報人士提供獎賞。
 
房委會亦會全面檢視「富戶政策」下的入息限額，要求有能力的公屋租戶遷出。房委會會考慮按能者多付的原則，增加「富戶」所須繳交的額外租金。"

Kim was speaking to reporters on the heels of a nail-biting defeat to compatriot An Byeong-hun at the 2024 Genesis Championship in Incheon on Sunday, a loss which he is hoping to use as motivation for the SAR tournament.

The Link Hong Kong Open, which will be staged for a 63rd time at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling from November 21 to 24, is set to feature a star lineup with the likes of Englishman Justin Rose, who won in 2015.

""I'm not thinking too much ahead of myself. I think that's the biggest thing,"" said the world number 25 – who last year became the youngest golfer since Tiger Woods to land three PGA Tour titles. 

""Golf is golf – anything can happen. Just because you're the highest-ranked player in the world, it doesn't always mean you're going to get the win."" 

But the 22-year-old, who already has two Asian Tour titles to his name, said he remains unfazed by the pressure, as he begins training to improve on his previous showing in the SAR when he finished 18th.

The Seoul-born athlete also shared how looking past the burden of growing expectations has helped him navigate the many challenges of his golf career.

""Looking at my career from the very beginning, I've always had steps that I've grown into,"" Kim said. ""And over the past year, there've been times where I've felt stuck.""

""So long as I take these hits and learn from them, I can be humble and grateful for when good moments do come,"" he added."

In the statement, the administration said it is both open and prudent towards the application of AI, while saying it wants the sector to use it in a responsible manner, noting issues such as cybersecurity and intellectual property rights.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan said officials will closely monitor market developments and draw on experiences on the mainland and overseas. 

He said the government will promote the use of AI in finance to accelerate the development of new quality productive forces tailored to Hong Kong's conditions.

""We consider it appropriate to adopt a dual-track model to AI. We will continue to encourage the adoption of AI to capture opportunities, while assessing its associated risks from time to time and mitigate them,"" the minister said during a speech at Hong Kong Fintech Week.

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said the University of Science and Technology will allow financial firms to use its AI language model, called InvestLM.

""[The university is] going to make their model available for use, not just for the big firms, but also the small firms in the financial services sector, including accounting and others, in such a way that they can try for themselves how AI can improve their work processes,"" he said.

Hui added that around 38 percent of institutions in the local financial sector use AI, about 12 percentage points higher than the global average. 

In the policy statement, the government added that it thinks the use of AI in finance is data-driven and dynamic, yet also double-edged in that it has both potential and risks. It said AI is a tool and shouldn't replace human judgement and analysis.

""Financial institutions should formulate an AI governance strategy to provide direction on how AI systems should be implemented and used. A risk-based approach should be adopted in the procurement, use and management of AI systems and human oversight will be crucial to mitigating the potential risks,"" it said.

The government said risks posed by the technology have been suitably reflected in relevant regulations and guidelines issued by financial regulators.

Officials also said the police have been exchanging intelligence with their overseas counterparts and the AI industry to address the cyber policing challenges posed by AI."

It came after Professor Ricky Tse, who is with the Life Education Centre of Hong Kong Nang Yan College of Higher Education, said students wouldn't kill themselves if they thought more about social responsibility and parental expectations. 

Tse also suggested life education such as watching chicks hatch would prevent students from ""doing anything stupid"".

Speaking on a radio programme, Heather Yeung from the Hong Kong Student Alliance on Student Suicide, said blaming the students was not helpful.

""Pointing the finger at students for their 'wrong values' is not good. The reasons for student suicide are complex and can't be explained by just one cause,"" she said. 

""We should not attribute suicidal behaviour solely to students' personal values, because it overlooks the influence of other factors."" 

Paul Yip, head of the Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, told the same programme that student suicides should be addressed carefully.

He said terms like ""doing stupid things"" - commonly used in Chinese to refer to taking one's life - should be avoided because they can be interpreted as blame or dismissal. 

""The World Health Organisation has said we should not stigmatise suicide. So I always encourage young people: 'It's okay not to be okay.' As long as you're willing to take a step forward and seek help, the help is available,"" he said.

But she was happy to attend the match and support her friend, who’s playing on one of the teams.

""[It's] really exciting. It's huge… My friend is playing football here,"" she said.

Spectators were encouraged to get to the sports ground from Sung Wong Toi - instead of Kai Tak - MTR station.

The MTR Corporation said it had implemented special arrangements at both stations. Plenty of signs were put up pointing passengers to the stadium.

Sports minister Kevin Yeung and sports commissioner George Tsoi were both spotted at the stadium.

Also in attendance was security chief Chris Tang, who was happy with what he saw so far before the match.

""Everything is smooth. When people depart [from] the MTR, there’s sufficient announcements, as well as notice direction showing how they come here,"" he told RTHK.

""We have adopted a phased approach, so at different stages, we have different [arrangements]. On this occasion, apart from making sure that it’s safe, it's also training to our frontline officers, so that's the reason why we are bringing extra officers to come here to make themselves familiar with the environment.""

Another event has been scheduled at the Youth Sports Ground in mid-November, as Hong Kong Men's Rugby Team host Brazil for a two-match international series. 

The second match will be played in Kai Tak, with an estimated attendance of 3,000 people.

Subdivided unit residents fear losing their homes,2024-10-27 17:05,"The government plans to eradicate substandard subdivided units, requiring registration as ""basic housing units"" with minimum size, individual toilet, and window. Some residents fear eviction or relocation due to unit renovations or unfavorable new locations. A mother and another group member express concern about higher rent and long waits for public housing.",2024-10-29 07:29,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1776430-20241027.htm,"A concern group on Sunday said residents of subdivided flats may be left homeless as the government proposed plans to put an end to inadequate housing.

The chief executive announced plans in the Policy Address to eradicate substandard subdivided units.

A future legislation will mandate the registration of such dwellings as ""basic housing units"". Each must be no less than eight square metres, or 86 square feet, in size, and fitted with an individual toilet and at least one window.

Units which fail to meet the set of standards will be outlawed. That could be a headache for tenants, who have to relocate elsewhere.

The Sham Shui Po Housing Concern Mothers' Group surveyed about 70 residents of subdivided flats following the announcement of the proposal.

About eight in 10 respondents said they wished to be directly allocated a public flat, instead of moving to temporary solutions such as light public housing, or transitional homes.

One of them was Amber, who was worried her landlord would evict them in the future because the unit had to be renovated in order to comply with the rules.

The mother of two added possible rehousing plans by the authorities may not be suitable.

""Even if they offer us a light public housing flat or transitional housing, I won't consider. The location is far. I'm not familiar with the new environment, and I don't want my children to transfer to another school,"" she explained.

Another group member, Lily, feared paying higher rent since there's a minimum size for future units.

""We hope they can build more public housing flats quickly. Some of us have waited for eight to 10 years,"" she appealed to the government."

The measure was first implemented in 2021, when the city's borders were shut due to Covid. In the end 17,569 voters cast their ballots at Heung Yuen Wai, Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau checkpoints without having to enter Hong Kong.

For last December's District Council election, officials allowed eligible voters on the mainland to vote at one of the designated polling stations near the border in Sheung Shui, sparing them a trip to their home district. Almost 10,000 people made use of the arrangement.

""If necessary, we will continue to set up these polling stations, or even enhance and expand [the arrangement], which we are also considering,"" he told a televised interview on Sunday. 

""There might be more choices by then, depending on where the site would be, or whether the location would be suitable as a polling station."" 

Tsang also confirmed the electronic poll register system would remain in use for the upcoming polls. 

The system broke down during last year's DC election, causing major delays at certain stations and prompting Electoral Affairs Commission chairman David Lok to issue a teary apology.

Tsang also said there's no need to further amend the current electoral system, saying it's in line with Hong Kong's long-term development."

Speaking on a radio programme, Chan revealed that the government's recurrent expenditure has gone up by HK$4 billion per year to facilitate new Policy Address measures.

Authorities will continue to issue up to HK$130 billion worth of bonds a year to fund various projects. He pointed out that outstanding government bonds make up only 6 percent of Hong Kong's gross domestic product, a level which is very low compared to other parts of the world.

""Hong Kong faces economic restructuring, and geopolitical uncertainties.... we need to take preventive measures, and at the same time we need to enhance development to make ourselves secure,"" he said.

Chan also estimated the government would return to fiscal balance in about three years. One way of achieving that, he said, was to slash expenditure by one percent each year.

On a separate note, the former development minister said authorities must continue to create land, even as the property market remains volatile.

Recalling the early 2000s when authorities froze their land sale programmes and stopped creating land in response to a market downturn, Chan said the impact of those decisions became evident now.

""We can better make use of the land in remote places, so prices for properties near the city centre won't be too high, when compared with remote places,"" he said.

The financial chief's hectic schedule continues with a visit to Saudi Arabia on Monday, just days after returning from the United States.

Writing on his weekly blog, Chan confirmed he will lead a delegation from the financial and innovation and technology sectors to Riyadh, with an aim to promote Hong Kong and explore business opportunities.

They will attend the Future Investment Initiative conference, and witness the launch of two exchange-traded funds tracking SAR stock indices on the Saudi Exchange."

BHP denies responsibility and says the agreement does not affect ongoing lawsuits.",2024-10-29 07:29,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1776399-20241027.htm,"Mining giants BHP and Vale have signed a deal with Brazil's government to pay nearly US$30 billion in damages for a 2015 dam collapse that triggered the country's worst environmental disaster.

President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attended the signing of the deal over the November 5, 2015 collapse of a tailings dam at a mine in the southeastern town of Mariana, which triggered a giant mudslide.

The river of mud swamped villages, rivers and rainforest, killing 19 people on its way to the sea.

""I hope the mining companies have learned their lesson: it would have cost them less to prevent (the disaster), much less,"" Lula said at the ceremony attended by representatives of Brazil's Vale and Australia's BHP, co-owners of the Brazilian company Samarco that operated the iron mine.

The agreement, which Lula declared to be the biggest environmental payout in modern history, comes on the fifth day of a separate mega-trial in London over BHP's role in the dam's failure.

More than 620,000 complainants, including 46 Brazilian municipalities and several Indigenous communities, are seeking an estimated 36 billion pounds (US$47 million) in damages in the civil trial.

BHP denies responsibility.

The company said on Friday that the agreement reached in Brasilia did not end the lawsuits pending against the companies, nor prevent others being taken.

The dam's failure released a torrent of over 40 million cubic meters of highly toxic sludge, the equivalent of 12,000 Olympic swimming pools, which coursed through the Doce River all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, over 600 kilometres away.

Over 600 people were left homeless.

Scientists say the mouth of the Doce River and parts of the southeast Atlantic coastline are still contaminated with metals from the spill, affecting the area's population of fish, birds, turtles, porpoises and whales.

BHP and Vale had already agreed in 2016 to pay 20 billion reais (about US$3.5 billion at today's rate) in damages, but the negotiations were reopened in 2021 due to what the government called their ""non-compliance"" and the slow progress of Brazil's justice system in resolving the dispute.

Friday's agreement in Brazil, which is subject to approval by the country's Supreme Court, covers the companies' past and future obligations to assist people, communities and ecosystems affected by the disaster. (AFP)"

He said it’s not necessary to share details of every case to the public.

“It depends on the severity of individual violations as well as social awareness. These are judgments we need to make. For example, regarding the Hong Chi case, of course we think the incident was serious, and society is highly concerned, so we believe it’s necessary to explain to the public the details of the case,” he said.

“Some other violations are really about technical problems. For such violations, we just follow procedures that we think are suitable.”

Tesla shares rose 3.36 percent a day after surging 22 percent on the electric vehicle maker's sales forecast. Amazon, Apple and Microsoft also rose.

""Tesla numbers helped rekindle some optimism of investors that the Magnificent Seven rally is not over,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.

He was referring to the group of interest rate-sensitive technology stocks which have surged on enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Chip heavyweight Nvidia gained, briefly overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company based on its shares.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield edged higher as investors awaited US employment data next week for clues on the likely path of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Earlier this week, the yield reached a three-month high of 4.26 percent, weighing on the stock market.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.61 percent to 42,114. The S&P 500 lost 0.03 percent to 5,808, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.56 percent, to 18,518.

The Dow was dragged down by banking shares, with Goldman Sachs down 2.27 percent, and it was also hit by a 2.97 percent fall in fast-food chain McDonald's, which has been hit by an E. coli outbreak linked to its hamburgers.

""Banks have rallied as (US presidential candidate Donald) Trump's odds (of winning) increased, so it seems investors are taking some profits,"" said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer at Angeles Investments.

Regional lender New York Community Bancorp dropped 8.26 percent after reporting its fourth straight quarterly loss, primarily due to its commercial real estate loans.

Continued uncertainty around the US election has made investors cautious.

Equities have been unsettled this week by a rapid rise in yields as bets on rate cuts by the Fed unraveled on expectations of a stronger economic outlook.

"Russia hikes interest rates to 21%, highest since 2003",2024-10-26 03:15,"Russia's central bank increased interest rates to 21%, the highest in over 20 years, due to surging inflation caused by high government spending on the Ukraine offensive. Inflation is running at 8.6%, more than double the target, and the bank may raise rates further. The IMT predicts 3.6% growth in 2024, despite Western sanctions. Putin discussed alternative payment systems at the Brics summit, but progress on Swift alternatives was limited.",2024-10-29 07:29,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1776235-20241026.htm,"Russia's central bank hiked interest rates to 21 percent on Friday, taking borrowing costs to their highest level in more than 20 years amid surging inflation.

The rise takes rates above an emergency level introduced in February 2022 – just after Moscow ordered troops into Ukraine – and to their highest since 2003.

""Further tightening of monetary policy is required to ensure the return of inflation to the target and reduce inflation expectations,"" the bank said in a statement announcing the increase.

The bank directly blamed high government spending for inflation and said it could hike rates yet again if the pace of price rises does not cool.

""Additional fiscal spending and the related expansion of the federal budget deficit in 2024 have pro-inflationary effects,"" it said.

Inflation has surged amid a massive increase in government spending on the Ukraine offensive that has triggered labour shortages across the economy.

Price rises were running at 8.6 percent on an annual basis in September, more than double the official 4.0-percent target.

Russian lawmakers voted on Thursday to increase defence expenditure by almost 30 percent next year, another sign Moscow is not planning to halt its spending on the offensive, grinding through its third year, anytime soon.

Several sectors of the economy are facing intense labour shortages, as hundreds of thousands of men have been called up to fight, fled the country or been recruited by a booming domestic weapons' industry.

That has created strong growth despite an unprecedented package of Western sanctions that Washington hoped would cripple the Russian economy.

The International Monetary Fund this week raised its growth forecast for Russia in 2024 to 3.6 percent.

But it has also led to a cycle of spiralling wages and prices that the Central Bank has long warned undermines economic stability.

Official borrowing costs in Russia have not been above 20 percent since 2003.

They regularly topped 100 percent throughout the 1990s, a decade of economic volatility and hardship following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

For years President Vladimir Putin has boasted of economic stability under his leadership, with his first years in office in the 2000s seeing an oil-led boom and rising wealth.

But his conflict in Ukraine has threatened Moscow's future prosperity, cutting it off from lucrative Western export markets and much of the global financial system.

Putin had hoped to advance plans for alternative international payment systems at the Brics summit in Kazan this week, the largest diplomatic gathering in Russia since the start of the offensive.

But speaking on Thursday, he indicated little progress had been made on talks over launching a possible competitor to the Belgium-based Swift financial messaging system.

""As for Swift and any alternatives, we have not created and are not creating any alternatives,"" Putin told reporters at the end of the summit.

""One of the key problems today is the problem of payments, that is why we are moving towards the use of national currencies,"" he said.

""As for a unified Brics currency, we are not considering that question at the moment,"" he added. (AFP)"

Shares of Tesla soared, with the EV-maker set to add more than US$140 billion to its market capitalization, after it reported robust third-quarter profits and surprised investors with a prediction of 20 percent to 30 percent sales growth next year.

This helped take the Consumer Discretionary sector higher.

""It was a blowout from the perspective of Tesla,"" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.

The benchmark S&P posted its first daily gain this week. However, sentiment was somewhat shaky. Most of the S&P sectors were in the red, as other earnings reports and pressure from lower, but still high Treasury yields weighed.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note eased to 4.20 percent, after reaching a three-month high the day before. It went as high as 4.26 percent in Wednesday's session, which saw all three major equity indexes lose ground. 

""In the near term, the greatest influence we've seen in stocks in October has been the move higher in rates. From a 10-year Treasury below 4 percent to where we stand now has been relatively quickly,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at US Bank Wealth Management.

Earnings announced before the bell include IBM, which lost after missing third-quarter revenue estimates, while Honeywell declined after it forecast annual sales below estimates, with both weighing on the blue-chip Dow.

The Dow fell a third of a percent to 42,374. The S&P gained a fifth of a percent to end at 5,809, while the Nasdaq gained 0.76 percent to 18,415.

Materials dropped, dragged down by Newmont as higher costs and weaker Nevada output saw it miss profit estimates. Boeing also lost after factory workers voted on Wednesday to reject a contract offer and continue a more than five-week-long strike.

Stocks have eased from record levels over the past few sessions due to a reassessment of bets on the Federal Reserve's rate cuts, rising Treasury yields, corporate earnings and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming US election.

China is a vital market for Apple, but recent years have seen the firm battle slumping sales in the face of increasingly stiff competition in the smartphone sector from local rivals.

Industry minister Jin Zhuanglong told Cook during a meeting on Wednesday morning that he hoped ""Apple will continue to deepen its presence in the Chinese market"", according to a ministry statement.

Jin also said he hoped Apple would ""increase investment in innovation, grow alongside Chinese firms, and share in the dividends of high-quality investment"".

""We will continue to expand high-level opening up,"" Jin told Cook, adding that China would strive to provide a ""better environment"" for global investors.

Wednesday's meeting saw the two exchange views on topics including ""Apple's development in China, network data security management, [and] cloud services"", the statement said.

Cook is visiting China for the second time this year, a trip that has seen him meet with university students and try out the iPhone 16's camera in a historic Beijing district with fashion photographer Chen Man.

The iPhone remains popular among Chinese consumers, but its sales have come under pressure in the country recently from local competitors, including Huawei.

The firm fell to number six in a ranking of smartphone vendors in China during the second quarter of the year – from number three during the same period last year – according to analysis firm Canalys. (AFP)"

In early trade Tokyo Metro shares were at 1,745 yen (US$11.5), up 45 percent from their issue price of 1,200 yen, with reports saying the issue was 15 times oversubscribed among investors.

Proceeds from the IPO will redeem reconstruction bonds issued after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan that killed 18,000 people.

The listing reduces government ownership, split between the country and Tokyo city, to around 50 percent. Many Japanese rail operators are already privatised.

To attract investors, perks for buying more than 200 shares included tickets to the Tokyo Metro museum and golf range, as well as free tempura toppings at its noodle stands.

The IPO is Japan's largest since tycoon Masayoshi Son's tech and telecoms conglomerate SoftBank Group raised a national record of US$23.5 billion by listing its mobile unit in 2018.

London built the first public underground railway, but in 1927 Tokyo became the first Asian city with a subway.

Each day around 6.5 million people ride the Metro's nine lines, which are part of a vast transport network serving the capital and its sprawling suburbs.

Four other subway lines are run separately by the Tokyo government, alongside private services and East Japan Railway's overground routes such as the Yamanote Line.

The network's cleanliness and efficiency contrasts with the often creaking infrastructure of other big cities like London, Paris and New York, where many operators are deep in debt.

Tokyo Metro posted a net profit of 46.3 billion yen for the fiscal year that ended in March 2024, up 67 percent from a year earlier. This year it is aiming to increase this to 52.3 billion yen. (AFP)"

McGowan was speaking to reporters after the celebration ceremony for the order of up to 150 aircraft with Airbus, during which the group's CEO, Ronald Lam said the expansion and modernisation of the Cathay fleet come as Hong Kong International Airport prepares to open its three-runway system at the end of the year.
