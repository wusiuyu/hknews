Hui's remarks came after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget that the government plans to issue about HK$150 billion to HK$195 billion worth of bonds annually over the next five years to support infrastructure projects such as the Northern Metropolis.

""In fact, we have long been in close contact with some relevant rating agencies and we have very regular communications, so that we'll ensure they know about the specific [financial] situation of Hong Kong, our bond issuance plans, as well as the reasoning on how we manage our finances,"" Hui said in a press conference.

""We're actually maintaining our debts at a very manageable level right now. As you can see, compared with some other economies, the share of our bond issuance to our overall gross domestic product is less than 17 percent. This is actually very manageable level compared with the international level.""

Separately, the financial services and treasury chief noted that authorities hope to improve the city's financial markets by conducting reforms of the stock trading and company listing mechanisms. 

Measures include the gradual introduction of a new function by the end of the year to enable most stock transactions to settle one business day after the trade date, in what's called the ""T+1"" settlement cycle.

Hui said that the new settlement cycle will help improve the quality of the city's stock trading, as the current ""T+2"" settlement cycle is lagging behind other international peers, such as the US, Canada, and Mexico.

""It's a global trend, really, in terms of increasing capital deployment efficiency, and allow capital to be returned to the investors sooner, so that they can utilise it further,"" he said.

Other reform measures include the establishment of a ""technology enterprises channel"" by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing to help specialist technology and biotechnology companies, especially those listed on the mainland, seek listings in Hong Kong.

Hui said that the new channel will provide ""tailor-made"" assistance and guidance for those firms to prepare better before they submit their IPO applications."

'Govt needs time to get ready for HK$2 subsidy tweaks',2025-02-27 21:17,The HK$2 transport subsidy scheme will be replaced with a new system where eligible commuters pay 20% of fares exceeding HK$10. The government aims to prepare all Octopus readers for the change and ensure machines are adjusted one by one. The subsidy scheme change was made after careful discussions to preserve the reasons for the HK$2 concession fare and ensure fiscal sustainability. Only a small percentage of users exceed the proposed monthly trip cap. The Labour and Welfare Bureau will also discuss a 7% cut in recurrent government spending with NGOs.,2025-02-27 21:45,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1793531-20250227.htm,"Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun on Thursday said it will take time for the authorities to prepare for changes to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme, which will be implemented no later than September next year.

As outlined in the budget delivered by Financial Secretary Paul Chan the day before, instead of a flat HK$2 fare, eligible commuters will have to pay 20 percent of any standard fare surpassing HK$10.

At a press briefing, Sun said the government wants to ensure all 17,000 Octopus readers in the city are properly set up for the ""HK$2 flat rate cum 80 per cent discount"" scheme, which will take time.

He said the machines are spread out on the MTR, buses, minibuses and resident coaches, and adjustments can only be made one-by-one at the end of the day.

The welfare minister also said changes to the subsidy scheme were made after careful discussions among officials.

“We believe we have struck a right balance between, first of all, to preserve as far as possible the very reasons of introducing a HK$2 concession fare scheme, which is to encourage our elderly and the disabled to go out and to see for themselves the beauty of the outside world and also to remain socially connected, and secondly, to make sure the concession fare scheme will be fiscally sustainable into the future,” he said.

As for the proposed monthly cap of 240 trips, Sun said only 360 people were found to have exceeded that number each month between August to November, amounting to less than 1 percent of all such users, so most other elderly and disabled travellers won't be affected.

Separately, Sun said his bureau has invited the 177 non-profit organisations (NGOs) that receive government funding for a meeting next Monday to discuss a proposed 7 percent cut in recurrent government spending through the 2027-28 financial year.

“We’ll let them know [how] exactly we’re going to work together to achieve the efficiency gains and yet at the same time providing more flexibility to our NGOs,” he said. ""Right now I'm not in a position to provide you with a detailed breakdown."""

38歲被告梁瑞盈，案發時為貿發局系統及內容發展助理業務經理；另一名39歲被告周恒業，則是AF Trinity Technologies Limited董事兼股東。

事發在2018年12月至2019年3月，貿發局為網上商貿平台e-Marketplace網站進行優化工作，梁瑞盈是其中一個負責該項目的職員，需要擬備相關的招標文件和評核準則，以及物色潛在服務供應商。貿發局邀請4間服務供應商競投項目，由周恒業成立的公司是其中一個投標者，並最終獲判授項目，總款項逾230萬元。

海外國家麻疹個案呈升勢　衞防中心籲市民接種麻疹疫苗,2025-02-27 20:11,,2025-02-27 21:45,local,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1793538-20250227.htm,"衞生防護中心表示，近期部分海外國家的麻疹個案呈上升趨勢，其中美國得州最近爆發麻疹，自上月底錄得至少124宗個案，主要涉及未曾接種麻疹疫苗或疫苗接種史不詳的人，超過八成影響18歲以下兒童，包括一宗沒有接種麻疹疫苗的學齡兒童死亡個案。

中心說，鄰近國家包括越南及菲律賓，亦因為當地整體麻疹疫苗接種覆蓋率偏低，持續出現麻疹爆發，呼籲市民接種麻疹疫苗。

中心總監徐樂堅表示，根據小學學童的免疫接種覆蓋率及衞生署定期進行全港免疫接種覆蓋調查，兩劑麻疹疫苗接種的整體覆蓋率一直維持在95%以上，本地麻疹病毒抗體的血清陽性率，反映絕大部分香港市民對麻疹已有免疫力，整體目前本地出現大型爆發麻疹的風險偏低，今年暫時亦沒有錄得麻疹個案。

不過，徐樂堅說，香港作為國際旅遊頻繁的城市，仍面對輸入麻疹病毒及其在本地社區進一步傳播的潛在風險，少數未完成接種麻疹疫苗的人士仍有機會受感染，並把麻疹傳播給其他未具備麻疹免疫力人士，例如一歲以下尚未接種第一劑麻疹疫苗的幼兒。

徐樂堅提到，1967年前出生的市民，由於當時麻疹在全球多個地方及香港仍屬風土病，故可視為透過自然感染而對麻疹具備免疫力，呼籲該年或以後出生、而尚未完成接種兩劑麻疹疫苗或對麻疹疫苗接種史不詳的人士，盡快諮詢家庭醫生以完成接種。"

控方質疑被告作出公開言論前，不查核新聞內容的真偽便引用，黎智英說新聞機構查核事件真偽後，才發布新聞，比他自行查核更有效率。控方指被告當時是想煽動反華及反政府情緒、引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛、引起憎恨或藐視中央及特區政府、激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑改變其他在港依法制定的事項，被告否認，辯稱只在陳述事實。

控方又引述被告在節目中，形容前任行政長官林鄭月娥是惡魔，問被告是否向對方作人身攻擊，被告回應「你可以這麼說」。控方指被告所有針對中央及特區政府的批評都是毫無根據，旨在煽動反政府情緒及引起讀者恐懼，被告不同意。

控方展示2020年5月被告曾接受美國《霍士財經網》訪問，稱《香港國安法》 將會實施，會對香港產生嚴重後果，希望時任總統特朗普採取行動。控方引述被告曾提到現在是時候對抗中國，並建議制裁中國官員。被告承認在《香港國安法》 生效前，曾呼籲外國制裁中國及香港。

控方提及被告在2020年6月曾接受《自由亞洲電台粵語部》訪問，提到外國需盡力向中國施壓，並對中國實施制裁。法官李運騰問被告訪問當日，即2020年6月10日，是否預先知悉《香港國安法》條文及所涵蓋的罪行，被告稱當時並不知道，是在《香港國安法》生效後才知道。"

陳翊庭說，有些企業往往因為創新，不確定是否符合上市規則，不清楚能否取得豁免，亦擔憂上市部門是否了解它們的創新研發技術。她強調，「科企專線」為這類企業量身訂造，有專門人手負責「手把手」處理，讓它們放心來港上市。

對於預算案提及港交所正推進單股多櫃台安排，包括雙櫃台股票使用同一國際證券識別碼，以提升交易結算效率。陳翊庭說，主要目的是推動更多香港上市公司多設立櫃台，可以用人民幣交易。

財政預算案提到，本港推進上市制度改革，包括優化雙重主要上市及第二上市門檻，陳翊庭期望，可以吸引到更多海外企業來港上市，強調港交所不時檢討上市規則。

Chan made the comment when lawmaker Chow Man-kwong asked him whether officials can come up with measures to boost the market so that it isn't ""overly cold"". 

Speaking at a Legco Finance Committee meeting discussing the new budget, Chan said officials hope that homes will be more affordable for the people.

""In the past, land sales were one of the main sources of government revenue that supported other kinds of development. This led to a surge in property prices because of a lack of supply,"" the minister said.

""We no longer want to see the SAR over-rely on land sales revenue. We need to develop the economy so that salaries and profits taxes and other forms of revenue are more important.""

New People's Party lawmaker Dominic Lee asked whether the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands project, previously known as Lantau Tomorrow Vision, is ""dead"", being as there is no mention of it in the budget. 

Chan said officials are prioritising the Northern Metropolis project, while stressing that ongoing studies relating to the artificial islands will continue.

""We want to focus on the Northern Metropolis, putting in every effort to speed up that project. Lantau Tomorrow is ranked behind the metropolis for sure,"" he said.

Business and Professionals Alliance lawmaker Jeffrey Lam, meanwhile, said businesspeople he has spoken to think the proposed HK$200 airport departure tax is too expensive, saying flight tickets to some nearby cities only cost that much.

Lam was also among several councillors who questioned whether a land departure tax for private cars is necessary, arguing that it would go against the desire for Hong Kong to integrate further with other Greater Bay Area cities.

Chan said the HK$80 increase in the airport departure tax is only minor.

He also said transport officials have received various feedback on the land departure tax, and the government does not have a finalised plan at this moment."

It added the remaining 10 places would be allocated to the universities’ existing medicine programmes.   

The document also stated the number of first-year undergraduates for the eight publicly-funded universities would remain at 15,000 for each year in the 2025-28 triennium.

Medical sector lawmaker David Lam said the increase was in line with his expectations, noting it was part of the bureau's ongoing plan to raise medical student intake. 

Lam said while there was a need for more doctors in view of an ageing population, medical schools cannot increase the number of training places drastically in the short run.

""We need to step up the teaching facilities in the universities and maintain a good number of teaching staff. Students also have to learn the clinical skills at the bedside on patients, which means we need enough hospitals to teach our students, and we need enough doctors, clinicians to mentor our students,"" he told RTHK.

During a radio phone-in programme, Chan fielded questions from callers on a wide range of cost-cutting measures detailed in his budget, including tweaks to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme for the over 60s and the phasing-out of a HK$2,500 student grant. 

A caller surnamed Wong said he was confused about the plan to charge private car drivers HK$200 to cross the border, a move the government says should raise about HK$1 billion a year.

""What kind of private cars will be levied? If you’re talking about cross-boundary vehicles with closed road permits, usually they have companies set up on the mainland and travel for business purposes,"" he said.

""If you wish to boost revenue, why not tax travellers who leave the city via land border control points?""

In response, Chan said quite a lot of money has been spent on cross-boundary facilities, including the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.

""Can we recover some of those costs? That is one of our considerations. Currently we're still in the research stage, and everyone can give their views so the Transport and Logistics Bureau and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau will consider them,"" he replied.

As for a departure tax for all travellers at land crossings, Chan said such a move would have quite a large impact on the general public, and this should be ""avoided as much as possible"".

Another caller was upset with the scrapping of the HK$2,500 student grant, which has been given out annually to the parents of children in kindergartens and primary or secondary schools since 2019.

""Didn't the government tell people to have more children? You cancelled this subsidy, but at the same time provide half a month of extra payment to recipients of social security and Old Age Allowance … What are the middle class like us supposed to do?” asked a woman surnamed Chan.

The financial chief acknowledged her concerns, but stressed that public resources should go to those most in need.

""Right now, this HK$2,500 does not require any means test and everyone is eligible … so we think if we were to cut down on expenditure, it has to come from these areas,"" he said.

Meanwhile, proposed tweaks to the HK$2 transport scheme for the over 60s also drew a lot of feedback.

""Why cap the number of trips at 240 per month, instead of raising the concessionary fare to HK$3 or HK$4?"" asked a man surnamed Leung.

In response, the FS said he wanted to keep the cheapest discounted fares at HK$2 because the scheme is widely recognised by society and encourages the elderly to go out more often.

""But by capping the number of trips at 240 [per month], we can limit the future expenditure growth. In the short term, we can even save money when the adjustments are implemented in 2027 or 2028,"" he said."

The vacancy rate of Grade-A offices reached a record 17 percent in January, according to commercial real estate agency Colliers.

That translates to 14 million square feet of empty floor space, while another 5.5 million square feet will be rolled out this year and 2026.

Kathy Lee, head of research and retail consultancy at Colliers, said rental value of prime office space plunged 40 percent over the past three years. 

""I think the government is very wise to stop selling any commercial land, [so as] to let the market to have some time to digest and absorb the existing available stocks,"" she told RTHK.

Lee added the decision to halt the sale of commercial land was not out of the blue, citing the example of the Queensway Plaza redevelopment which was put on ice amid a market downturn.

But Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at CBRE, warned the current supply glut will take as long as 10 years to be fully absorbed.

On a separate note, the government also extended the $100 concessionary stamp duty to all properties priced at HK$4 million or below, up from HK$3 million.

Lee from Colliers welcomed the adjustment, saying it will ease the burden for homebuyers.

""The interest rates remain at a high level, so a lot of homebuyers might still find it difficult to meet their mortgage duties. I think this will help boost demand for smaller-sized units,"" she explained.

However, JLL Hong Kong chairman Joseph Tsang was less optimistic. 

""The Budget doesn't focus much on the property market. And this measure has no stimulating effect on the housing market but will instead affect government revenue,"" he said in a statement.

""With the high inventory of residential properties, housing prices are likely to continue falling."""

The 240 monthly maximum number of trips mentioned by Financial Secretary Paul Chan in his budget works out at around eight per day on average in future.

Ho Lok-sang, adjunct professor of Lingnan University’s Department of Economics, said the government has good intentions in trying to cut costs.

But he also said very few over 60s make that many journeys, so the move won't save much for the government.

“I don't think capping the number of trips for the elderly makes sense. It's not going to make much effect on the revenue anyway because there are relatively few people who will travel so many times,” he told RTHK.

“I think there's really no point in making that kind of provision, because it makes people feel bad and it also tarnishes the government's image in terms of caring for the benefit of the well-being of the elderly.”
 
Ho added that a small number of people could be affected by the cap, such as those who need to make a lot of transfers.

New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip, for her part, said she welcomes the changes to the fare scheme, which include offering an 80 percent discount for journeys that cost regular passengers more than HK$10, rather than the current HK$2 flat rate subsidised trip.

""I think the government measures introduced to make it sustainable are fairly moderate,"" said Ip, who's also convenor of the Executive Council. 

""(There is) no impact on the qualifying age of those benefiting from this concession, but it would help to solve the problem of paying very little fare for very long journeys.""

DAB party vice-chairman Holden Chow also supports the changes.

""We believe the scheme unveiled by the (financial secretary) today is acceptable. It strikes a balance between the [need for] financial sustainability, but at the same time, will look after the needs of the elderly,"" he said.

""The people who live further away from the city centre, including people in Tuen Mun or Tung Chung, they may actually be affected. I think going forward, we will try to explore with the government and see whether there's anything we could do to alleviate the pain of these people."""

Chan said his budget puts forward a ""reinforced version"" of the fiscal consolidation programme, which includes a cumulative reduction of government recurrent expenditure by seven percent from now through 2027-28. 

Speaking to the press, he said the government is moving in the right direction to achieve a fiscal balance.

""On the one hand, we try our best to diversify and grow our economy, but at the same time it is a belt-tightening budget, so everybody in the community would need to contribute to this effort,"" he said.

""We are trying to do the best we can in minimising the impact on our people, but at the same time, unavoidably, everyone has to chip in a little bit.""

The finance chief said the government has no plans at present to introduce any new taxes, such as a goods and services tax.

""We have to pay regard to the following considerations. One is the competitiveness of Hong Kong, in terms of attracting investment and talent. Secondly, if we are to increase revenue, we try to minimise the impact on the average citizen,"" Chan said."
University funding cuts 'acceptable': lawmaker,2025-02-26 17:23,,2025-02-27 21:45,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1793324-20250226.htm,"Lawmaker and Lingnan University's associate vice president Lau Chi-pang on Wednesday said he believed universities could cope with the proposed funding cuts which he described as ""mild and acceptable"". 

In his budget speech, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said he would set aside HK$68.1 billion for government-funded universities over the next three years, which reflect a two percent reduction each year.

The government said the funding cut could save around HK$2.8 billion for the 2025-28 triennium. 

Lau told RTHK that universities had been preparing for the reduction and could absorb it without scaling down teaching or administrative staff. 

""It is acceptable in a way that we do have reserves for research, development, and other expenses. So this two percent, if it's only a triennium cut, I would say that the university community can absorb that,"" he said. 

However, he noted the city's universities were expanding and competing globally, which requires substantial funding. 

Universities will also have to return HK$4 billion from their General and Development Reserve Fund to the government on a one-off basis, the University Grants Committee said in a statement.

Lau said while this is not good news, institutions were developing income sources including self-funded postgraduate programmes to help balance the funding cuts.

""Of course, we don't welcome any cut because universities are expanding our scope and we are competing with other world-class universities in the ranking, and we are helping our country to build up an even stronger higher education community,"" he said. 

On the scrapping of the HK$2,500 student grant from the 2025-26 academic year, Lau believed the impact on low-income pupils would be minimal. 

""That HK$2,500 was given to students when most students were having these online classes and they require a lot more assistance, but now we are back to a normal situation. So I don't think this is a kind of financial aid that we need to continue,"" he said."
'Public sector pay freeze is the best choice',2025-02-26 16:09,,2025-02-27 21:45,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1793303-20250226.htm,"Executive Council convenor Regina Ip on Wednesday said she supported the government's decision to freeze public servants' pay.

This includes civil servants, executive authorities, members of the judiciary, legislators and district councillors.

She noted it would be up to the chief executive to decide whether or not to cut the salary of fellow Exco members, or even donate their salary.

""I think freezing public servants' pay, including our pay, legislators' pay, is the best option forward in the present circumstances,"" she said.

""Cut backs will have ripple effects on the private sector and it will affect the labour sector as well.""

Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget that two percent of the civil service would be cut annually between the 2026/27 and 2027/28 financial years, but Ip believes the move will not affect government efficiency.

Felix Yip, associate director of the centre for human resources strategy and development at Baptist University, said slashing 10,000 civil service posts by April 2027 is reasonable, given advances in AI.

""I guess those jobs may be coming from those administrative positions... We are not talking about effectiveness, but talking about efficiency. They can gain a lot from the application of AI,"" Yip said.

""So in that regard, to a certain extent, the cost can be minimal."""
Dose of sweeteners in budget despite belt-tightening,2025-02-26 14:30,,2025-02-27 21:45,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1793261-20250226.htm,"Efforts to contain government spending didn't stop Financial Secretary Paul Chan from sprinkling some sweeteners into the budget announced on Wednesday, but his offerings were slimmed down this time around.

The familiar 100 percent reduction in salaries tax or tax under personal assessment will be provided once again, but this time with a cap of HK$1,500. That's half last year's HK$3,000 ceiling, which itself was half the previous year's HK$6,000.

There's also a reduction in profits tax for the current financial year but the cap is being halved as well, also to HK$1,500. 

Chan said more than 2.1 million taxpayers and over 165,000 businesses will benefit from these two relief measures which will take a HK$3.1 billion bite out of government revenue.

Homeowners, meanwhile, will get a rates concession of up to HK$500 for the first quarter of 2025/26, as will owners of non-domestic properties. Last time, it was HK$1,000.

An extra dose of cash for social security recipients has also survived the budget constraints and is unchanged from last year, with an additional half-month payment of regular allowances, including Comprehensive Social Security Assistance payments, Old Age Allowance, Disability Allowance and Working Family Allowance. 

Chan also had some good news for people planning to buy property. 

""To ease the burden on buyers of residential and non‑residential properties at lower values, I announce that the maximum value of properties chargeable to a stamp duty of HK$100 will be raised from HK$3 million to HK$4 million with immediate effect,"" he said.

This year's budget sweeteners amount to HK$8.3 billion in total, down from HK$11.5 billion last year."

The departure tax for air passengers will go up from HK$120 to HK$200 from the third quarter of the 2025-26 financial year, with Chan saying ""the impact on air passengers is expected to be minimal"". 

This will generate HK$1.6 billion in revenue to the government each year. 

The finance chief also said transport officials will review the tolls of tunnels and major expressways in the city, and explore charging private vehicles travelling via land boundary control points.

""The government has cancelled the tolls of some major tunnels and strategic routes three years ago and the tolls of some government tunnels have not been adjusted for over 30 years,"" he said.

Private vehicles departing the land borders may be subject to a levy, which Chan expects to generate HK$1 billion each year, assuming a fee of HK$200 per car.

In addition, the Transport and Logistics Bureau will review annual licence fees for electric vehicles, parking metre charges and fixed penalties for traffic offences. 

Chan also said there'll be a HK$600 application fee for various talent and capital investor admission schemes with immediate effect.

The visa fees will be raised to HK$600 or HK$1,300 ""based on the duration of limit of stay"", and expected to generate HK$620 million each year.

""For some time in the past, some government fees and charges have not been adjusted in accordance with the established mechanisms. As a result, these fees and charges are not pegged to their costs and fail to reflect the 'user pays' principle,"" he said."
"Pay freezes, job and spending cuts to tackle deficit",2025-02-26 13:44,,2025-02-27 21:45,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1793264-20250226.htm,"Financial Secretary Paul Chan said containing government spending would be a top priority for the administration in the coming years as he outlined plans for job cuts, pay freezes and reducing expenditure.

Chan said he had instructed all bureaux and departments to review their resource allocation and work priorities, and provide public services in a more cost-effective manner by consolidating internal resources, streamlining procedures and leveraging technology.

These moves would lay a ""sustainable fiscal foundation for future development"", he said, with the government facing a deficit of HK$87.2 billion.

The finance chief said that in the coming financial year, the government would implement pay freezes for civil servants, executive authorities, members of the judiciary as well as those serving in the legislative and district councils.

Among the cost cutting measures, Chan proposed the rate of reduction of recurrent government expenditure would be increased from the original one percent to two percent in the 2025‑26 financial year.  

This arrangement would be extended for two more years to the 2027‑28 financial year.  

Taking into account the one percent cut unveiled for the current financial year, the cumulative rate of reduction would be seven percent in total.  

Chan said this would deliver a saving in recurrent government expenditure of around HK$62 billion in the coming financial years up to 2028.
 
The financial secretary also said the civil service would be reduced by two percent annually between the 2026-27 and 2027-28 financial years, resulting in about 10,000 jobs cut by April 1, 2027.

The cuts in spending will also affect the education sector.

Chan said the government would provide HK$68.1 billion to University Grants Committee-funded universities in the coming three years.  

This funding has reflected a two percent reduction target each year, which was in line with the magnitude of government's recurrent expenditure cut."
Paul Chan delivers 2025-26 budget,2025-02-26 11:12,,2025-02-27 21:45,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1793205-20250226.htm,"Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday delivered his 2025-26 budget to the Legislative Council.

Chan started the speech for his financial blueprint – which aims to tackle an estimated HK$100 billion deficit – by saying that Hong Kong needs to reform, innovate and relentlessly improve.

He pointed out that though counter-cyclical measures launched in the past few years to counter the pandemic have stabilised the economy and eased people’s burden, it has resulted in a fiscal deficit.

“In this budget, I propose a reinforced version of the fiscal consolidation programme, including a cumulative reduction of government recurrent expenditure by seven percent from now through 2027-28,"" he told lawmakers at Legco.

“Strictly containing public expenditure is a must, but we should proceed in a steady and prudent manner, and be careful to find a balance among the various impacts that may arise in the process.”

The finance minister also said the “approach represents our all-out effort to minimise the impact on public services and people's livelihood”, adding that ""it gives us a clear pathway towards the goal of restoring fiscal balance”.

On the SAR's economic growth, Chan said authorities forecast that Hong Kong's gross domestic product will continue to grow moderately this year, rising two to three percent in real terms.

The economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2024.

He also forecast that the economy will grow, on average, by 2.9 percent a year in real terms from 2026 to 2029, with underlying inflation expected to be at an average of 2.5 percent a year.

Wall Street falls amid pessimistic consumer sentiment,2025-02-26 07:13,,2025-02-27 21:45,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1793174-20250226.htm,"Some of Wall Street’s brightest stars lost more of their shine on Tuesday after another report said US households are getting more pessimistic about the economy.

The S&P 500 fell 0.5 percent to 5,995 – it's fourth straight drop after setting an all-time high last week.

The Nasdaq composite sank 1.4 percent to 19,026 as several influential Big Tech companies lost momentum and screeched lower. 

But the majority of stocks nevertheless rose, which helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 159 points, or 0.4 percent to 43,621.

The US stock market has been generally struggling since the middle of last week after several weaker-than-expected reports on the economy thudded onto Wall Street. 

On Tuesday, the latest said confidence among US consumers is falling by more than economists expected.

The pessimism hit high-momentum areas of the market in particular, those that had seen waves of euphoric investors pile in during recent years. 

Nvidia fell 2.8 percent, for example, while Tesla tumbled 8.4 percent. They were the two heaviest weights on the S&P 500.

Bitcoin likewise sank, falling back toward US$88,000, which dragged down stocks of companies in the crypto industry. 

MicroStrategy, the company that’s raised money in order to buy more bitcoin and now goes by the name Strategy, fell 11.4 percent.

Zoom Communications dropped 8.5 percent even though it reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected. 

They helped offset a 2.8 percent rise for Home Depot, which delivered a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Along with Home Depot, the majority of stocks within the S&P 500 rose. 

The pace of profit reports is slowing, but the potentially most anticipated report is still to come on Wednesday. That’s Nvidia, which has grown to become one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of nearly insatiable demand for its chips.

Wednesday will provide the first earnings report for the company and its CEO, Jensen Huang, since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, upended the artificial-intelligence industry by saying it developed a large language model that can compete with big US rivals without having to use the most expensive chips.

“The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,” Trump said.

Trump has claimed that other countries charge unfair import taxes that have come at the expense of domestic manufacturing and jobs. 

His near constant threats of tariffs have already raised concerns among businesses and consumers about an economic slowdown and accelerating inflation. 

But Trump claims that the import taxes would ultimately generate revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit and new jobs for workers.

Still, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum appeared confident on Monday that her administration would reach agreements with the US government before the deadline set by Trump.

“We would need to be reaching important agreements this Friday,” Sheinbaum told reporters before Trump's remarks. 

In high-level discussions between both governments, Mexico has insisted that the US also take a hard look at the drug distribution and consumption in its own country rather than pointing only at production in Mexico, Sheinbaum said. (AP)"
Wall Street holds steadier but still falls,2025-02-25 07:30,,2025-02-27 21:45,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1793018-20250225.htm,"US stocks drifted lower on Monday to compound their sharp losses from last week .

The S&P 500 dipped 0.5 percent to 5,983 after flipping between small gains and losses several times through the day. The relatively modest moves followed its 1.7 percent tumble on Friday, which came after several weaker-than-expected reports on the US economy.

The Dow added 0.1 percent to 43.461, while the Nasdaq composite fell 1.2 percent to 19,286.

Berkshire Hathaway climbed 4.1 percent for one of the market’s bigger gains after Warren Buffett’s company reported a jumped in operating profits for the latest quarter. 

Starbucks rose 1.3 percent after saying it would cut 1,100 corporate jobs and leave several hundred more positions unfilled as new CEO Brian Niccol tries to make it a leaner operation.

Big US companies have broadly been reporting better profits for the last three months of 2024 than analysts expected, which is one of the main reasons the S&P 500 set a record before sliding at the end of last week. The pace of reports will slow this week, but several potentially market-moving updates are still on deck.

Chief among them is Nvidia, the company that’s become one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of what had been nearly insatiable demand for its chips.

Wednesday will be the company’s first profit report since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, upended the artificial-intelligence industry by saying it developed a large language model that can compete with big US rivals without having to use the top-flight, most expensive chips. (AP)"

The power giant made a profit of around HK$6.6 billion in 2023. 

It has declared a fourth interim dividend payment of HK$1.26 per share, bringing the total dividend last year to HK$3.15, up from HK$3.10 in 2023.

The company's CEO Chiang Tung-keung said one of CLP's goals is to phase out its remaining coal-fired electricity assets and look into opportunities to use different technologies in the future.

""We'll start looking at some emerging technologies, including hydrogen, virtual power plants or carbon capture. Those are technologies that we will be interested in,"" he said.

""If we want to achieve net zero by 2050, apart from doing renewable energy, we expect these kinds of technologies will take a very important part, in particular towards the latter part of the coming decade, when we are closer to 2050.""

Chiang added that CLP supports the government in pushing forward innovation and technology development, especially in the Northern Metropolis. 

He said his company has reserved sufficient power system capacity to meet the demand for electricity for artificial intelligence and supercomputing centres."

Investors have piled into Chinese technology stocks since the start of the year, with Alibaba – which runs some of the country's biggest online shopping platforms – seeing its shares soar to three-year highs.

The gains have been boosted since the Hangzhou-based firm announced robust sales growth last week.

Alibaba plans to ""invest at least 380 billion yuan over the next three years to advance its cloud computing and AI infrastructure"", a company statement said.

The firm said its strategy was aimed at ""reinforcing (Alibaba's) commitment to long-term technological innovation... (and) underscores the company's focus on AI-driven growth"".

The statement did not detail how the company would allocate the funds or what specific projects would be supported.

It did add that the investment would exceed its total AI and cloud spending over the past decade.

Alibaba last week reported an 8 percent bump in revenue for the three months through December, beating estimates to reach 280 billion yuan and triggering a 14 percent surge in its Hong Kong shares on Friday.

CEO Eddie Wu said last week that the quarterly results ""demonstrated substantial progress in (Alibaba's) 'user-first, AI-driven' strategies and the re-accelerated growth of our core businesses"". (AFP)"

楊德強說，兩日賽事亦有超過4300人次入場，為香港手球隊提供以賽代練、寓賽於操的經驗，藉此檢視訓練效果，大會另外安排了超過500名義工參與，幫助他們熟悉場地及義工服務流程。
