US stocks tumble as chipmakers see weakness,2024-10-16 06:44,"Wall Street stocks declined on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 dropping 0.8% and 0.6% respectively, and the Nasdaq falling 1%.

The Dow Jones slumped 0.8 percent to 42,740, as did the S&P 500 to 5,815.

The Nasdaq retreated 1.0 percent to 18,315.

Stocks saw a mixed performance at the start of the day, with traders responding mostly positively to earnings reports, but eventually they lost ground.

Chipmakers in particular struggled as markets reacted to reports that President Joe Biden's administration was considering a cap on exports of advanced AI chips to some countries.

Dutch tech giant ASML, which supplies chip-making machines to the semiconductor industry, also saw its shares dive in Europe after unveiling a cut to its 2025 guidance and seeing a disappointing slump in sales bookings.

""The selloff is because of ASML suggesting that demand is not as strong"" as anticipated for chips and AI, said Quincy Krosby of LPL Financial.

""ASML mentioned that demand is down from China. That's one of the biggest markets. There's chatter that the US government could start perhaps curbing chip sales even more,"" Krosby added.

Among individual companies, ASML shares plunged 16.3 percent in the United States, while chip titan Nvidia lost 4.5 percent.

AMD, another major chip company, was down 5.2 percent. (AFP)"

裁判官溫紹明判刑時表示，案件並非單一事件，而且案情嚴重，被告以其職權壓榨工人薪金，損害社會公平和僱主利益。裁判官以監禁9個月為量刑起點，考慮到被告認罪及其他求情因素，將刑期扣減至7個月，並頒令被告須向其時任僱主嘉民機電工程有限公司，歸還涉案賄款。

案情透露，嘉民於案發時是香港國際機場海天中轉大樓客運碼頭行李輸送帶安裝工程的分判商。嘉民主要透過已入職工人介紹，以招聘其他工人，而所有工人日薪一律為1200元，該公司不容許員工就其業務向任何人索取或接受利益。被告於2022年6月加入嘉民，擔任該工程項目的安裝技工，亦會向嘉民介紹工人入職。

被告承認於2022年7月至11月期間，分別向3名由被告介紹入職的工人，索取每個工作日100元的賄款。該3名工人相信，如拒絕支付賄款便不會獲嘉民聘用，於是答允被告的索賄要求。被告先後從3名工人收取近22000元，每人支付賄款由4500元至8700元不等。"

廉署早前接獲貪污投訴，調查後發現兩名被告於2021年4月，分別向警務處申請參加「超過訂明退休年齡的警務人員繼續服務計劃」，但涉嫌在申報表格上訛稱沒有任何未償還債務，當時從未受「個人自願安排」所規限。兩名被告當時各自尚欠財務公司及儲蓄互助社債務共約45萬元及24萬元。二人亦涉嫌隱瞞曾經受「個人自願安排」所規限。

身兼香港警察隊員佐級協會當然會長的蕭澤頤，出席協會成立47周年酒會致辭時，感謝前線警員在日常工作時顯示出同理心、視市民猶如自己家人和朋友，他說，不時收到市民的讚賞信感謝警員處理事件時展現出同理心、易地而處，從受害人或其家人的困擾出發，盡力協助對方減低憂慮和困擾。

蕭澤頤又說，協會除了是作為警隊管理層和前線警員的重要溝通橋樑，同時亦是兩者的強力後盾，協會各級代表在不同渠道向政府各個政策局和警隊管理層反映警員在工作、福利、服務條件等議題的關注和意見，令警隊能在有限資源下發揮無限潛能。

林志偉在協會成立47周年酒會致辭時說，警隊正面對招募和挽留人手困難，這對警隊工作的經驗傳承會產生一些不良影響，以往巡邏小隊人手相對充足時，前線指揮官可以安排一個較資深的警員帶領新警員工作，但現時前線人手嚴重不足，已很難做到這個安排，加上近年有不少具相當經驗年資的警員流失，令有關問題相對變得更嚴重，協會認為警隊內部已經盡了最大責任和能力作出內部調配，但也不能完全解決包括軍裝和刑偵警員人手不足和流失的問題。

林志偉認為，政府在未來日子應該主動審視警隊的服務條件，是否有足夠吸引力吸納和挽留人手，警隊在招聘方面的競爭力相對其他政府部門是否有吸引力，如果人手不足情況不能盡快解決，協會相信警隊的一些問題會逐漸深化，繼而影響服務市民的效率。

林志偉又說，香港警隊成立180周年以來，克服了無數的挑戰考驗，始終是香港市民最可信賴的夥伴和守護者，他在警隊服務了30多年見證警隊不少改變和進步，唯一從未改變的是守護香港的初心。"

他估計，第3季經濟增長或與第2季的4.7%相若，可能較上半年5%增長放慢，但考慮到目前市場氣氛，加上市場憧憬將有大型財政政策出台，令人行下調LPR幅度上會較為審慎，相信下調焦點在於1年期LPR。

薛俊昇預計，今年底或明年初內地仍有降準空間，目前平均存款準備金率仍有6.4%，預料人行減息和降準會循序漸進穩步進行，並觀察政策出台後的市場反應。"

他表示，投資推廣署努力吸引海外企業進駐香港，今年首9個月已吸引37間消費品行業來港，按年增長32%；吸引50家餐飲、旅遊及款待行業企業，按年增85%。他又指，當局將繼續在內地不同城市進行路演，又預計投資推廣署的土耳其辦事處明年首季開始運作。

“Obviously we spotted that because of the diverse range of packages, classes, terms, expiry period of membership, the situation of every individual could be quite different. But in general, for those with shorter terms and also lesser amount, it’s more easy for them to accept the new proposal.

“On the other hand, for those customers who have a bigger amount with a much longer duration and have many private classes, that may require review on every individual,” she said.

Wong said the council will continue to hold talks with perFIT and work on a mutually agreeable solution for everyone involved."

The watchdog said it surveyed 62 supermarket products, including food, daily necessities and pet food with volume or weight changes over the past 3.5 years.  

It found that nearly all of them had seen weight or volume reduction ranging from about one percent to as much as 30 percent.

Almost 40 percent of products showed a de facto price increase, with the highest reaching 26.2 percent based on the average per-unit recommended retail price, the council noted.

The council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong said while it is reasonable for retailers to seek profit-making measures, they should also be fair to consumers.

""Because usually for this kind of little change, consumers may not easily spot it except you follow the product for a long, long time. You are so loyal to that, then you follow,"" she said.

""Otherwise, when there's a modest change, like this time, [a drop of] only three grams of instant noodle or maybe 20 grams of body lotion, it's really hard for consumers to keep track of that.""

She noted that while some countries, like South Korea, have implemented legislation to increase transparency regarding changes in product size, such as listing the unit price, this may not be the optimal solution for Hong Kong.

""The reason is Hong Kong is a very open market. We import a lot of products worldwide. We don't have our self-production that much. So, if we ask the government to legislate according to what other markets have been doing right now, we have to consider whether it is the most effective measure,"" she said.

The watchdog said it tested 17 serums and 10 of them had a lower concentration of vitamin C than the manufacturer claimed. 

While one actually had more vitamin C than advertised, another one had none whatsoever.

The council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong, said they have referred their findings to the authorities.

“We have already shared this report to the Customs and Excise Department. So if there is any alleged infringement of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, they would take an independent enforcement action on that,” she said.

The watchdog urged manufacturers to improve their labelling practices, noting that five of the products tested failed to list the vitamin C concentration.

In addition, the label for one serum didn't mention an expiry date, while six others didn't have a list of ingredients in either English or Chinese.

The council also discovered that seven of the serums contained fragrance allergens with restricted use in the EU, saying eczema sufferers or individuals with allergies could develop contact dermatitis or rashes from overexposure to the products."

Lee told reporters that officials need to focus on several things, and one of them is ensuring the affected area of the zoo doesn't expand further.

""The relevant section has been closed off. Disinfection has been conducted. So we have contained the area,"" he said before the weekly Executive Council meeting.

""The second step is to control. Apart from the cleaning and disinfection, we have to continue monitoring the situation to ensure that the problem will not spread.""

Lee said autopsies, tests and toxicology analyses should be completed as soon as possible so that experts can find out the reasons behind the deaths.

Workers need to wear protective gear properly, Lee added.

""There were... over 1,000 mainland tourist groups visiting Hong Kong. The actual figure is 1,050. Eighty percent of these tour groups actually stayed overnight.""

Citing industry figures, the chief executive said restaurants saw increased turnover during the week, as they also benefited from events to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Australia vows ban on some swipe and tap surcharges,2024-10-15 10:38,"Australia aims to ban debit card surcharges from 2026 and lower electronic payment costs, targeting Visa and Mastercard in a billion-dollar industry.

The country's centre-left government said it would ""ban debit card surcharges"" from 2026 and work to lower the cost of other types of electronic payments.

Australians now use cash for less than 16 percent of transactions, spelling boom times for electronic payment providers.

They take a cut of almost every transaction, charging retailers a fee of between one and two percent to run each payment.

Australia's central bank estimates merchants paid more than US$4 billion in transaction fees from 2022-2023 alone.

Many small shops pass along these costs to the consumer. But some larger companies – such as global retail chains – are often able to negotiate substantial discounts.

Authorities have said it was determined to bring costs down and to stop small vendors from being gouged.

""Consumers shouldn't be punished for using cards or digital payments, and at the same time, small businesses shouldn't have to pay hefty fees just to get paid themselves,"" said economy minister Jim Chalmers.

In the United States, Visa and Mastercard this year agreed to limit transaction fees and pay US$30 billion to end an anti-trust investigation.

A court has since threatened to reject that deal as overgenerous to Visa and Mastercard. The European Union has longstanding caps on fees.

Credit and debit card companies have previously warned that regulation would mean less competitive markets and only mask the cost for consumers. (AFP)"

China's export growth slows sharply in September,2024-10-14 17:37,"Exports grew at their slowest pace in 5 months in September, missing forecasts, indicating softening global demand for Chinese goods.

Outbound shipments from the world's second-largest economy grew 2.4 percent year on year by value last month, customs data showed on Monday, missing a forecast of six percent increase by a poll of economists. 

Exports rose 8.7 percent in August.

Imports edged up 0.3 percent, missing expectations for a 0.9 percent increase and in contrast to the previous figure of 0.5 percent growth.

China's exports grew at their fastest pace in nearly 1.5 years in August, but economists cautioned that officials in the country should avoid becoming too reliant on global demand as they work to bolster overall growth.

On Saturday, officials in Beijing announced plans to ramp up debt issuance to aid local governments in managing their debt problems and provide increased support to low-income earners. 

However, they did not state the size of the fiscal stimulus at the highly anticipated news conference, disappointing markets.

Analysts anticipate it will take a long time to restore consumer and business confidence and get the US$19 trillion economy on a more solid footing. 

A housing market recovery, in particular, could be a long way off.

Last week, the head of China's state planner said he was ""fully confident"" of achieving the government's full-year growth target of around five percent.

Manufacturing activity shrank for a fifth straight month in September, with new export orders falling to their worst in seven months. 

Analysts have attributed previous months' strong export performance to factory owners slashing prices to find buyers.

The European Commission last week saw its motion to impose additional duties on electric vehicles built in China of up to 45 percent pass in a divided vote of EU member states, joining the US and Canada in tightening trade measures against China.

China's overall trade surplus narrowed to US$81.71 billion in September from US$91.02 billion in August and missed a forecast of US$89.80 billion. (Reuters)"

FTU lawmaker Michael Luk said the majority of government-run chargers have a slow or medium speed and require at least a few hours to fully charge a vehicle.

""It's more appropriate to set up fast chargers at government-run venues. Normally, they are for the public to use, such as when people are going to sports grounds, sports centres or town halls,"" he said.

""They may only stay there for about one to two hours. If there are fast chargers, their vehicle will be fully recharged.""

Thirty percent of them were part of the Strive and Rise Programme, which pairs underprivileged pupils with volunteer mentors.

The park said the pair's eyes have fully opened and they have started developing their hearing. 

It said the female now weighs 2.7 kg and her brother weighs about 2.5 kg. 

Howard Chuk, head of the park's zoological operations and conservation, said staff have been sharing the job of looking after the cubs with the pandas' mother, Ying Ying.

""Although we have all the nursery facilities, including the incubator, we try to maximise the opportunities to allow Ying Ying to take care of the cubs. This benefits the behaviour, as well as the health of the cubs,"" Chuk said.

""But... we need to ensure Ying Ying is capable, and also we are pretty sure the babies are safe after we return or rotate the cubs back to Ying Ying.""

Elke Wu, an assistant curator of zoological operations, said Ying Ying is about 80 percent recovered from giving birth.

""She's a first-time mum and she's not young anymore, so her recovery is really slow and she's very picky at her appetite,"" she said.

""Our whole husbandry team spends so much time looking for food that she likes, or making food into different forms that she will be willing to take in, and we literally just feed it into her mouth sometimes.""

Wu said it is still difficult to tell the twins apart but they have different characteristics, with the female having messy fur and the male having rounder dark circles around his eyes."

Photos and videos of the rider putting a Locobike through its paces across Stonecutters Bridge and nearby highways went viral online. 

Many cyclists confirmed spotting the rider along the route, adding they were humbled by the light-blue bicycle that was never designed for long-distance riding, let alone competing in races. 

""A real rider does not need top equipment. Does this put some people to shame?"" One user wrote on Facebook.

Others suspected it was a publicity stunt, as the man was also seen wearing a jersey bearing Locobike's logo.

But the company insisted it had no part to play in the feat and was still ""thinking of ways"" to reward the rider.

The bike-sharing platform also posted a log sheet on Facebook, suggesting the man completed the race in two hours and 28 minutes, translating to an average speed of 20.2km per hour.

What happened to the bike after the race, as some might wonder?

A Facebook post showed workers staging a protest at the construction site at the Clearwater Bay campus on Monday morning.

Mr Chau, a union representative, revealed it was not the first time the workers did not receive their wages on time, with construction even halted between May and June this year.

He told RTHK that workers had demanded school officials resolve the dispute by the end of this week.

Work is still under way after a new contractor, Hip Hing Construction, took over the project last month, Chau added.

According to HKUST's website, construction of the HK$1.2 billion development began in 2020, and was supposed to be completed last year.

The dead animals were four White-faced Sakis, three Cotton-top Tamarins, one De Brazza’s Monkey and one Common Squirrel Monkey.

The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) said it's liaising with officials from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, and autopsies and other tests are being carried out to determine the cause of death.

It said the mammals section of the facility in Central was closed from Monday for disinfection.

""We will also closely monitor the health conditions of other animals,"" the LCSD said in a statement.

""During this period, other facilities of the HKZBG will remain open.""

Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung on Monday convened an urgent interdepartmental meeting to discuss the matter.

In a statement, the government said officials have completed the disinfection and cleaning of animal cages involved, and staff working at the park are in healthy conditions.

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said it is uncommon to have multiple animal fatalities within a short time-frame, and an investigation was needed to pinpoint the cause.

It hoped the results could provide clarity and insight into the incident.

Dr Florence Tang, from the Chinese University's School of Biomedical Sciences, said there was a low possibility of infectious diseases being spread.

""If the [death of the] monkeys were caused by infectious diseases, there should be an incubation period. During the incubation period, they should show symptoms,"" she told RTHK.

""But there were no signals for those keepers to alert those monkeys were sick. The other monkeys are very happy in the cages.""

She added that some visitors might have fed the monkeys.

Tang reminded park visitors to avoid having close contact with animals there, and operators should step up sanitation measures to prevent similar incidents from happening.

Park visitors, meanwhile, were left disappointed with the temporary closure of the mammals section.

A man and his granddaughter visited the gardens on Monday.

""I was a bit disappointed. Of course I think the closure was unfortunate. For us adults, the closure was not a big problem. But for children, they are more interested in the animals and they are more curious,"" he said.

""For me, I am reaching retirement age soon. I just take my granddaughter out to play when I am free.""

Chhavi and her family came all the way from Australia just to find that the mammals section of the gardens was closed temporarily.

""[I] feel a bit disappointed obviously, and it just started from today,"" she said.

""We will probably see the birds and whatever we can.""

""We will examine the teaching of the two medical schools, especially in clinical training, to see whether the training for some common medical procedures is adequate. We will communicate with the schools to ensure our graduates are fit to practice,"" he said.

Separately, the health minister said the SAR government has contacted the mainland authorities to look for a life-saving heart transplant for three-month-old baby girl Whitney in Hong Kong. 

""I know mainland authorities have been actively responding to us, but we must understand that there are not many organ donations, especially for a three-month-old baby girl. The donor's body size has to be similar to hers. Due to heart sizes, it is not that easy,"" Lo added.

The consumer price index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, rose 0.4 percent year-on-year in September, down from the 0.6 percent increase recorded in August, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.

Meanwhile, the producer price index (PPI) fell at the fastest pace in six months, down 2.8 percent year-on-year in September, versus a 1.8 percent decline the previous month 

The slowdown comes as authorities have been seeking to boost domestic activity and shore up China's property sector, with officials on Saturday announcing plans for a significant fiscal stimulus package.

Finance Minister Lan Fo'an told a news conference there will be more ""counter-cyclical measures"" this year, but officials did not provide details on the size or timing of fiscal stimulus being prepared, which investors hope will ease deflationary pressures in the world's second-largest economy.

""China faces persistent deflationary pressure due to weak domestic demand. The change of fiscal policy stance as indicated by the press conference yesterday (Saturday) would help to deal with such problems,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.

In recent weeks, policymakers have unveiled a string of measures in a bid to stimulate activity and spur household consumption.

The central bank in late September announced the most aggressive monetary support measures since the Covid-19 pandemic, including numerous steps to help pull the property sector out of a severe, multi-year slump, including mortgage rate cuts. (Agencies)"

The College of Ophthalmologists and the Ophthalmology Society said while the disease is primarily associated with an over-active thyroid gland, it can sometimes occur in patients with an under-active or normally functioning thyroid gland. 

Dr Kelvin Chong from the College of Opthalmologists said people should keep an eye out for symptoms, such as bulging eyes and double vision, as it is typically harder for Asian patients to identify the disease. 

“[Patients] of Asian descent, their skin colours are darker, their skin is thicker, and they have a higher pain threshold. Many of the symptoms do not present until there are obvious deformities of the eye, for example, proptosis or double vision,” Chong said. 

Common symptoms include double vision, eye discomfort, visual dysfunction and disfigurement. 

Doctors added that the disease can cause permanent damage to patients’ eyesight and physical appearance. It may also lead to severe complications like nerve compression, corneal ulcer, and even cause blindness. 

High risk groups include men, smokers, people aged 50 or above, those with a stressful lifestyle, as well as patients with thyroid gland disorders. 

Chong said there are different ways to treat the condition. 

“Depending on the stage and the severity, it ranges from medical treatment that modulates the immune functions, all the way to having surgery that expands the socket, realign the eye or eyelid,” he noted.

A 90-year-old man surnamed Chau was diagnosed with thyroid eye disease in mid-2023, after being found to have hyperthyroidism a year ago. 

Chau’s son said his father developed symptoms like dry and swollen eyes, and was treated with steroid therapy, radiotherapy, and immunosuppressants. 

""He now feels more confident working in front of the computer, and he’s still writing a book. The appearance of his eyes looked much better and he said his eyes don't feel dry anymore.”"

楊德強接受一個電視節目訪問表示，全運會要求運動員住宿地點，與比賽場地要在半小時車程內到達，當局正在不同比賽場地附近物色酒店作為運動員住宿地點，雖然有3個項目會在啟德體育園舉行，但他認為啟德的隔離設施並不適合用作運動員住宿，因運動員需要有健身室及開會場地，另外因運動員需要藥檢，因此對於食物及廚房要求亦都好高，相信酒店會較符合要求。

Boeing to cut 10% of workforce as it sees big Q3 loss,2024-10-12 16:05,"Boeing plans to reduce its workforce by 10%, affecting 17,000 positions globally, due to a strike in Seattle, financial struggles, and safety lapses. The strike has cost Boeing $3 billion in charges and pushed back the delivery of the 777X to 2026. The company also plans to cease 767 Freighter production in 2027. Striking workers seek wage hikes and pension reinstatement, citing low wages amid inflation. Boeing's shares fell by 1%.",2024-10-16 00:44,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1774207-20241012.htm,"Boeing announced that it plans to cut 10 percent of its workforce as it projected a large third-quarter loss amid a machinist strike in the Seattle region.

The aviation giant must ""reset our workforce levels to align with our financial reality,"" Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg said on Friday, adding that the cuts of 17,000 positions globally ""will include executives, managers and employees.""

The company announced a series of belt-tightening measures and production delays as the nearly monthlong strike of 33,000 workers has added to the company's litany of problems.

Boeing staff with the International Association of Machinists (IAM) and Aerospace Workers walked off the job on September 13 after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract offer.

Boeing, which has also faced significant scrutiny over commercial aviation safety lapses and stumbles in its Starliner space program, said the IAM strike contributed to US$3 billion in pre-tax charges to its commercial aviation results in the third quarter, part of an anticipated loss of US$9.97 per share.

""While our business is facing near-term challenges, we are making important strategic decisions for our future and have a clear view on the work we must do to restore our company,"" Ortberg said in a press release.

""These decisive actions, along with key structural changes to our business, are necessary to remain competitive over the long term.""

Details of the cuts would come next week, he said.

As a result of the strike, Boeing said it is pushing back first delivery of the 777X to 2026 from 2025. The much-delayed jet was originally supposed to enter service in January 2020.

The company plans to cease production of the 767 Freighter in 2027 once it completes production on current orders.

The striking workers are seeking hefty wage hikes and a reinstatement of their pension, complaining of more than a decade of near-flat wages amid inflation.

Ratings agency S&P estimated this week that the strike was costing Boeing US$1 billion per month.

Shares of Boeing fell about 1 percent in after-hours trading. (AFP)"

The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent to 5,815.03, also a record, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.3 percent to 18,342.94.

Dow member JPMorgan Chase rose more than four percent as it reported better than expected earnings behind higher revenues for equity trading and increased fees for asset management and investment banking.

Investors also cheered the bank's assessment that the US economy remains ""resilient"" and poised to avoid a recession.

""The bank earnings were an excuse to rally, not necessarily a reason to rally,"" said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers. ""Right now the market mentality is to rally, and it's going to do that... unless it has a reason not to, and there was no reason not to today.""

Analysts have said the latest inflation data likely reduces the odds of another large interest cut by the Federal Reserve in November, but doesn't eliminate the chance for a smaller reduction.

Expectations for Fed relief on interest rates has propelled the market for much of 2024.

The closely watched Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent on a monthly basis in September and 2.4% on an annual basis, with both figures being slightly higher than estimated by economists.

The core figure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.3 percent year-over-year, versus an estimate of 3.2 percent.

In a separate report released on Thursday, jobless claims also rose to 258,000 for the week ending Oct. 5, versus an estimate of 230,000.

""Investors were torn between a stronger than expected CPI report and a weaker than expected unemployment claims report,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital in Chicago. ""One showed inflation running hotter than expected and the other showed the economy looking weaker than expected. It's the worst of both worlds.""

After the economic data, traders were pricing in a roughly 80 percent probability that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 basis points at its meeting in November and a roughly 20 percent chance it would leave rates unchanged, according to CME's FedWatch.

Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic on Thursday said he would be ""totally comfortable"" skipping an interest-rate cut at an upcoming meeting of the US central bank, adding that the ""choppiness"" in recent data on inflation and employment may warrant leaving rates on hold in November.

Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said he sees ""gradual"" rate cuts over the next year-and-a-half, while the New York Fed's John Williams said he still sees rate reductions ahead.

The consumer price index (CPI) slowed to 2.4 percent in September from a year ago, down from 2.5 percent in August, the Labor Department said in a statement.

This was slightly below the median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.

There was also some cause for concern for the Federal Reserve as it looks to cut interest rates: A measure of inflation that strips out volatile food and energy costs rose slightly to 3.3 percent, up from 3.2 percent in August, buoyed by a jump in the transportation services index last month.

Monthly headline inflation rose by 0.2 percent, while core inflation also exceeded forecasts to increase by 0.3 percent. Both monthly figures also exceeded expectations.

Despite the ""slight upward surprise relative to what we're expecting,"" the inflation picture isn't all bad, Oxford Economics' deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce told AFP.

""I think the broader trend in services inflation, I think I'm still confident in the view that that's going to continue to trend lower over the next 12 months,"" he said, referring to easing of services inflation from 0.2 percent in August to 0.2 percent in September.

The economy has remained a top concern for voters going into the upcoming presidential election, in which Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is running against the Republican former president Donald Trump.

Both candidates have looked to talk up their record in government while criticizing their opponent's economic plans.

While inflation has eased toward the Federal Reserve's long-term target of two percent, the labour market has shown some signs of cooling in recent months, causing policymakers to refocus their attention on the employment side of the bank's dual mandate.

Against this backdrop, the Fed voted last month to cut interest rates by half a percentage-point and pencilled in an additional half point of cuts this year.

Thursday's inflation data ""supports a more measured pace of rate cuts,"" Pearce from Oxford Economics said.

""I think they're still confident that inflation is heading down, but obviously that, you know, we will see noisy reports like today's,"" he added. ""It's going to be a bumpy process. It's not a glide path down to down to two percent."" (AFP)"

Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran confirmed Tata’s death and described him in a statement as his “friend, mentor, and guide.” 

He did not provide a cause of death.

Tata was admitted this week to the Breach Candy Hospital in south Mumbai, the city where he lived. 

Soon after he was hospitalised, Tata issued a statement on Monday saying there was no cause for concern regarding his health and he was undergoing checkups for age-related medical conditions.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Tata as a visionary leader, and a compassionate and extraordinary human being.

""He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond boardrooms,"" Modi said on X.

""Tata endeared himself to people, thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,” Modi said, referring to his philanthropy.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Ratan Tata left behind an extraordinary business and philanthropic legacy and he was instrumental in mentoring and developing modern business leadership in India.

""My last meeting with Ratan Tata at Google, we talked about the progress of Waymo and his vision was inspiring to hear,” Pichai said on X. ""He deeply cared about making India better.”

Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, said, “It is a very sad day for India and India Inc,"" he said. 

""Ratan Tata’s passing away is a big loss, not just to the Tata Group, but to every Indian.”

In June 2008, Tata bought Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford for US$2.3 billion.

Tata pioneered commercial aviation in India when it launched an airline in 1932 that later became Air India. The government later took it over.

Tata Group bought state-owned Air India in 2021. It also started a full-service carrier, Vistara, with Singapore Airlines, but recently merged it with Air India.

The announcement came after mainland stocks tumbled on Wednesday following a blistering rally in response to one of Beijing’s most aggressive stimulus package in years.

The PBOC had slashed interest on one-year loans to financial institutions, cut the amount of cash lenders must keep on hand and pushed to lower rates on existing mortgages.
