陳茂波出席國際金融領袖投資峰會致辭時又表示，正致力與大灣區城市合作，發展香港成為創新及科技中心，特別聚焦人工智能、生物科技及新材料等領域，當中，「粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所」年底將在落馬洲啟用，相信有助吸引更多生物科技企業進入內地市場，亦期望透過建立初級藥物及醫療器械註冊機構，長遠推動藥械獲內地認可。

他又表示，發展創新科技需要人才和資金配合，政府推出的吸引人才計劃獲得熱烈響應；透過成立香港投資管理公司作為香港的「耐心」資本，尋找有助提升香港競爭力及回報的戰略投資機會，相信可以為香港相關產業提供關鍵支持，並引導私人資本投入。

他說，近年市場出現對本港的誤解，特別是資金流出的評論，但實際上國際投資者繼續對香港保持信心，銀行存款、資產及財富管理業務持續增長，在本港的資產管理規模當中，香港境外投資者佔比逾一半，認為香港作為國際金融中心仍然保持活力，讓投資者和企業營商保持蓬勃發展。"

他在香港出席國際金融領袖投資峰會時表示，人工智能（AI）和雲技術就像手同手套的關係。現時公司無論以市場分額或技術計，都是中國最大的雲公司，15年前就出於自身需求而投資雲技術。

蔡崇信又說，在半導體領域對脫鉤的感覺最強烈，因為美國政府決定限制高級別晶片出口，亦包括製造技術和光刻技術，有關限制針對中國，迫使中國脫鉤，迫使中國自行發展半導體業。他形容現時未見到任何曙光，認為有關趨勢將未來4、5年持續。他又指，AI開發成本高而需時，大家應該合作共同發展。

蔡崇信說，全球供應鏈碎片化，部份生產轉移到其他地區，短期不利中國，但長期有利發展中國家增長，當有關地區變得富裕，會有能力向全球包括中國購買產品。

他亦不認為製造業會大規模離開中國，指出雖然中國人口減少，但勞動力規模仍然龐大。"

3-tier subversion offenders 'not strictly applicable',2024-11-19 14:27,"The High Court stated that a strict three-tier penalty system for subversion offenders in Hong Kong's largest national security case isn't fully applicable due to the conspiracy charge against 45 defendants, who were jailed for plotting to overthrow the government in 2020. Principal offenders received sentences ranging from 4 years to life, while active participants received 3-10 years. Activist Owen Chow received 7 years and 9 months, former journalist Gwyneth Ho 7 years, and former lawmakers Lam and Leung 6 years and 9 months.

The lightest sentences were given to former lawmakers Tam and Mo.",2024-11-19 15:30,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1779868-20241119.htm,"The High Court on Tuesday said a three-tier penalty system classifying offenders convicted of subversion “should not be strictly applicable” in Hong Kong’s largest national security case to date.

The offence under the national security law for ""principal offenders"" carries a penalty of at least 10 years behind bars to life imprisonment. Someone who “actively participates in the offence” will see a sentence of three to 10 years, while “other participants” will see lesser penalties.

“After a careful consideration of all the authorities, we came to the view that in respect of the present case which all the defendants faced was only a conspiracy charge, the penalty banding as prescribed in [Article 22 of the National Security Law], whilst of reference value, should not be strictly applicable,” three presiding judges wrote in a ruling.

Forty-five people were jailed for four years and two months to 10 years each for taking part in a plot to overthrow the government in 2020 by securing a majority in the Legislative Council and indiscriminately voting down the administration's budget and spending initiatives to cause a constitutional crisis.

The bench rejected arguments that the scheme was doomed to fail and the defendants should be given lighter sentences.

“In order to succeed, the organisers and participants might have hurdles to overcome, that however was expected in every subversion case where efforts were made to overthrow or paralyse a government,” they wrote. 

“In this case, candidates for the primary election were essential [characters] of the scheme, without them, the scheme simply could not get off the ground. They lent their support to and actively participated in the scheme.”

The bench added: “Had the scheme been carried out to the very end, the adverse consequences would be far reaching and no less serious than overthrowing the government of the [Hong Kong SAR].”

Besides the four “principal offenders”, 41 other defendants were deemed ""active participants” by the court.

Among them, jailed activist Owen Chow was jailed for seven years and nine months, businessman Gordon Ng received a jail term of seven years and three months, and former journalist Gwyneth Ho was imprisoned for seven years.

Former lawmakers Lam Cheuk-ting and Leung Kwok-hung, as well as ex-hospital worker Winnie Yu, were each sentenced to six years and nine months behind bars.

Another defendant, former student activist Joshua Wong, was slapped with a jail term of four years and eight months.

The court reduced his sentence by one-third for his guilty plea, but said it “did not consider him to be a person of good character” given his criminal records. 

“It should be noted that [Wong] committed the present offence while he was on court bail,"" the court said. “We did not think we should give further reduction because [Wong] could not have all the offences sentenced in the same proceedings. The sentence we passed on [Wong] also would not have a crushing effect on him.”

Among those who were given the lightest sentences of four years and two months are former lawmakers Jeremy Tam and Claudia Mo. 

Regarding Mo, the judges said they were “sympathetic to the ailing health” of her husband, Philip Bowring.

“However, the health condition of [Mo’s] husband is not a matter that can militate against the sentence to be passed on [Mo],” the judges said."

Tai received the heaviest jail term of 10 years among all defendants.

The three presiding national security judges – Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan – considered a starting point of 15 years behind bars for Tai, and reduced that by one-third after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion.

“​​In short, [Tai] was not only the initiator of the scheme, but also an organiser of the primary election… He was the mastermind behind, hence could well be placed in the ‘[principal] offender’ category,” the judges wrote.

“[Tai] might not be the one standing in the primary election or the actual Legco election, he however provided the necessary platform for those who intended to exercise the vetoing power under the scheme.”

Three others – former lawmaker Au Nok-hin and former district councillors Andrew Chiu and Ben Chung – were also named “principal offenders”.

They had pleaded guilty and become prosecution witnesses in the trial.

The trio received jail sentences of six years and one month to seven years each.

Thirty-one of them pleaded guilty and 14 others were convicted in May for taking part in a plot to overthrow the government by securing a majority in the Legislative Council and indiscriminately voting down the administration's budget and spending initiatives to cause a constitutional crisis.

The High Court sentenced former legal academic Benny Tai, who it said “advocated for a revolution” and masterminded the scheme, to 10 years in prison as a principal offender under Article 22 of the National Security Law (NSL).

Three others who were also deemed to be principal offenders for their roles in organising an unsanctioned Legco primary poll related to the conspiracy – former lawmaker Au Nok-hin, along with ex-district councillors Andrew Chiu and Ben Chung – were given jail terms ranging from six years and one month to seven years each.

The 41 others were all ruled to have been ""active participants"" in the plot, with the heaviest sentences meted out to Owen Chow – who was jailed for seven years and nine months – and businessman Gordon Ng, who got seven years and three months. The lightest sentence given was four years and two months. 

In handing down the sentences, national security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan stressed that ""had the scheme been carried out to the very end, the adverse consequences would be far reaching and no less serious than overthrowing the Government of the HKSAR.""

""Whether the scheme would ultimately succeed, it was not for this Court to speculate,"" they added. ""What we were sure was that all the participants had put in every endeavour to make it a success.""

They also stressed that while the court looked into things that happened before the NSL was enacted on July 1, 2020 to assess the seriousness and extensiveness of the conspiracy, none of the defendants were actually sentenced for any acts they committed during this time.
 
“However, they remained willing parties to that agreement and continued their participation in the scheme after it had been rendered criminal by the NSL”, they noted.

Two of the 47 defendants were acquitted earlier.

陳國基說，綠色金融是香港政府的核心政策重點，去年香港發行的綠色零售債券的數量位居亞洲市場第一，佔總量37%。他提到中國的金融發展持續成為全球經濟增長的基石，在國家的支持下，香港繼續成為全球最大的離岸人民幣業務中心，香港努力擴大產品範圍、提供更多元的人民幣投資產品，同時增加人民幣債券發行規模，支持在港發行更多綠色及可持續的離岸人民幣債券。

他表示，推動跨境理財通和債券通等措施，有助提升香港作為投資者進入內地市場的首選地位。科技也對香港的未來同樣重要，人工智慧、區塊鏈及數據分析正在提高市場效率和推動金融創新，1000間金融科技公司和初創公司令金融服務更為便利及更有效率。

陳國基又提到，當局與金融監管機構合作，金管局啟動了沙盒項目，證監會將制定資產代幣化的監管框架，確保資產以安全、透明的方式交易，當局透過這些舉措，努力建立更光明、更繁榮和可持續的未來。"

他表示，面向未來，三中全會擘劃了進一步全面深化改革、推進中國式現代化的宏偉藍圖，中國推進改革的決心始終堅定不移，對對外開放的大門只會越開越大，隨著各項重大改革扎實推進，必將進一步釋放中國經濟的巨大增長潛力，也必將為全球經濟增長持續注入穩定性和新動能。

何立峰強調國家好，香港一定好；香港好，國家會更好。他希望香港繼續發揮背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，緊緊抓住國家進一步全面深化改革、推進中國式現代化帶來的歷史性機遇，深度對接國家發展戰略，在進一步融入國家發展大局、助力國家高品質發展中，更好地實現自身高品質發展，在新征程上不斷譜寫「一國兩制」實踐精彩華章。他們們也歡迎各界國際友人積極參與香港改革發展、參與中國改革開放和現代化建設，共用發展機遇，共同為世界發展繁榮穩定貢獻力量。"

何立峰說，期望香港繼續緊緊把握寶貴的發展關鍵期，準確識變、科學應變、主動求變，傳承發揚「獅子山精神」，銳意進取，拼搏奮鬥，不斷提高金融發展水準，持續鞏固提升香港國際金融中心地位。

何立峰提出三點建議，第一是進一步深化金融改革創新，不斷提升香港金融競爭力，百尺竿頭更進一步，唯有堅持改革、不斷創新。他表示，他們支持香港通過改革創新，進一步做強銀行業，增強資本市場包容性和吸引力，穩步擴大債券市場，積極發展保險市場，豐富離岸人民幣金融產品和服務。他們支援香港打造更高水平的國際資產管理中心、財富管理中心，加快發展綠色金融、科技金融、數字金融等新業態，積極發展家族辦公室業務，不斷培育新的金融增長點，塑造競爭新優勢，希望香港因時因勢，不斷優化完善金融發展政策環境，為進一步深化金融改革創新提供強有力支撐保障。

第二點建議是進一步拓展金融開放合作，持續增添香港金融發展活力。何立峰指出，香港是開放型經濟體，國際化是香港的鮮明特色和顯著優勢，香港擁有高度自由開放規範的國際一流營商環境，普通法制度與國際接軌，國際聯通網路發達，香港金融業正是在開放中不斷發展壯大。他們支持香港繼續保持特色、發揮優勢，同世界各地開展更廣泛、更密切的交流，拓展國際金融合作，積極開拓佈局新興市場，吸引更多國際資本、一流機構和人才來港展業興業。他們支援香港立足自身實際和發展需要，加強與全球其他國際金融中心的交流互鑒，積極借鑒吸收全球金融改革發展的最新經驗和成果，始終走在全球金融發展前列。

至於第三點建議，何立峰說是要進一步對接國家發展戰略，著力夯實香港金融發展根基，香港是國家對外開放的橋樑和紐帶，國家是香港金融發展的根基和強大後盾所在。隨著國家高品質發展扎實推進，香港在國家發展大局中的戰略地位作用將更加凸顯，他們支援香港積極參與國家擴大制度型開放、以更大力度吸引外資和對外投資、優化區域開放佈局等重大改革，並在其中充分發揮獨特作用。他們支持香港進一步做優做強「一帶一路」國際投融資平合，不斷增強在「一帶一路」資金融通中的關鍵節點作用。他們支持香港牢牢把握粵港澳大灣區發展戰略，持續推進金融等領域規則銜接、機制對接和重點工作部署落地生效，不斷提升粵港澳大灣區建設品質和發展水準。

他指出，多年來，香港金融監管有力有效，金融市場規範有序，金融運行總體平穩，特別是在國家支持下，成功應對了多輪金融危機和外部衝擊考驗，對防範化解重大風險具有豐富經驗和堅實基礎。何立峰期望香港繼續守護好金融安全，中央將一如既往、全力以赴為香港深化金融改革發展、維護金融穩定安全提供充分支持和保障。"

Spirit, the biggest US budget airline, had been losing money despite strong travel demand as it struggled with higher operating costs.

Spirit's troubles deepened after the collapse of its US$3.8 billion planned merger with JetBlue Airways in January and the impact of RTX's Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines snag that grounded many of its aircraft.

The airline listed its estimated assets and liabilities in the range of US$1 billion to US$10 billion each, according to a court filing on Monday.

Spirit has entered into an agreement with its bondholders that is expected to reduce total debt and provide increased financial flexibility.

The airline, as part of the prearranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, has received commitment for a US$350 million equity investment from existing bondholders.

Existing bondholders will also provide US$300 million in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing, which, together with available cash, is expected to support the airline through the Chapter 11 process.

The carrier said it expected to continue its flight operations through the proceedings and customers can book and fly without interruption.

In documents submitted to the legislature, the Transport and Logistics Bureau said KMB and New Lantao Bus are seeking hikes of 6.5 percent, while CityBus wants a 9.5 percent increase.

The companies made the applications for higher fares earlier in the year.

Officials said the bus operators have averaged around 3.7 million passenger trips a day in the first half of this year, about 90 to 95 percent of what they were before the pandemic.

They said the government has been helping the firms boost income and cut costs.

""However, with rising salary expenses and volatile fuel costs, as well as continued competition for passengers with other transport modes, the financial situation of franchised bus operators has not been satisfactory,"" the bureau said in the document.

The government said it will strike a balance between the public's affordability and financial sustainability of the operators when considering the applications.

Lawmakers are due to discuss the matter on Friday.

Last year, the bus firms raised fares from between a little less than 4 percent and 7 percent."
Tai Lam Tunnel to charge time-varying tolls: sources,2024-11-18 20:15,"The government plans to implement cheaper, time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel starting May, similar to cross-harbour tunnels. Peak hour toll for private cars will be HK$45, general HK$30, and non-peak HK$18. Taxis will pay HK$28, and commercial vehicles HK$43.

The tolling system would be similar to the ones for the three cross-harbour tunnels brought in last year, with three levels of charges for peak, general and non-peak hours.

Currently, private car drivers need to pay HK$58 for using the tunnel connecting Ting Kau with Yuen Long.

Sources said in future, it will be HK$45 for peak, HK$30 for general and HK$18 for non-peak hours.

An across-the-board charge of HK$28 is being mooted for taxis, down from HK$58 at the moment.

And commercial vehicles will pay HK$43, which would be cheaper than current toll levels.

DAB lawmaker Ben Chan, who chairs the Legco transport panel, said he finds HK$45 for private cars during peak hours to be on the high side.

As for taxis, he said the toll could be set at HK$25, the same as that for the three cross-harbour tunnels.

""Compared with the current situation, perhaps some truck drivers using Tuen Mun Road may turn to Tai Lam Tunnel (during peak hours in future), causing further congestion,"" he told RTHK.

""So I believe if the government charges the time-varying tolls, that can allow the spread of traffic in an orderly manner. I think that's a good thing.""

The tunnel's 30-year franchise began in 1995 and is currently fully-owned by a subsidiary of Sun Hung Kai Properties."

Her research project quantified livestock damage on bamboo ecosystems and identified suitable grazing areas.

She also emphasizes the need for adequate space and care for captive pandas in Hong Kong, using them as a window to understand wild panda conservation.",2024-11-19 15:30,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1779709-20241118.htm,"An associate professor of environmental science on Monday said sustainable grazing practices backed by regulations and community involvement are vital for protecting giant wild panda habitats. 

Binbin Li from Duke Kunshan University led a research project from July 2018 to May 2024 in China, quantifying the damage caused by livestock grazing on bamboo ecosystems and other vital vegetation. 

""The problem is fragmentation. We have agriculture, cropland, linear infrastructure and also residency area, so that makes their habitat fragmented, and then a lot of the populations are so small, and we're worried about the local extinction of some of the small populations,"" she said. 

""The key right now is how we can reconnect some of the habitat and also reduce degradation for example from livestock grazing or the other types of natural resource uses.""

Li said that by assessing the impact of grazing on pandas, the study was able to identify suitable grazing areas and patterns, adding that these findings lay the groundwork for developing effective grazing management policies to safeguard panda habitats.

""There is a livestock ban in certain areas but we also provide composition from the government and to the local communities but not just composite them to sell their livestock but also provide some long-time subsidy for example give like job opportunities to hire them as rangers so then they can receive long-term incentives not to have livestock again,"" she said. 

""This is key for a lot of conservation actions. How you can provide a long-term mechanism to incentivise local communities and to do conservation.""

Li was speaking to reporters after the kick-off ceremony for the 29th Ocean Park Conservation Day under the theme ""Safeguarding Wild Giant Pandas and Their Habitats"". 

In regards to the six pandas living in Hong Kong, she said pandas in captivity need to be given a lot of space and care, adding that she hopes the SAR's enthusiasm for the animals will drive conservation. 

""You need to pay attention to the welfare of pandas in captivity and enough space, and then the air conditioning is good, especially during summer, because they love cool temperatures. I think captive pandas are very important as a window to understand what is going on with the wild pandas. So the key thing for captivity or zoos is to do education,"" she said.

""These six pandas, maybe they can attract more attention from the public and to conserve pandas in the wild because there are a lot more out there and they are facing more threats than the captive pandas."""

The government earlier earmarked HK$350 million for a pilot scheme subsidising operators to introduce a total of four electric ferries.

The first of these, operated by Sun Ferry, will conduct its final tests in Hong Kong waters by the end of this year, before it starts running between North Point and Hung Hom.

Vanessa Au, an assistant director of the EPD, said the use of electric ferries will improve air quality around Victoria Harbour, and they are also more cost-effective.

""We hope that the operating expenses for ferries can be reduced, but we have to test how much the actual reduction can be,"" she said.

""Through this pilot scheme, we hope within 24 months we can compare the electricity consumption and the traditional fuel consumption. Because it's using the motor technology, we hope to cut the maintenance cost as well.""

Au said charging an electric ferry for about eight hours overnight is enough for a full day's operation.

She added that solar panels will be installed on the deck of the ferries to support part of the lighting system.

Zheng Cheng-qi, deputy general manager of Sun Ferry, said he hopes to see more electric ferries in Hong Kong, but the industry needs further assistance from the government.

Hiring all year round boosts civil service recruitment,2024-11-18 14:33,"Year-round recruitment drive in civil service has shortened approval time, leading to a surge in job acceptances and reducing resignations to 1.8%. 30% of resignations occur during probation.

The government has been continuously recruiting for some roles since October last year.

At a Legislative Council panel meeting, Yeung said this allows job offers to be made more quickly compared to the previous system of only receiving applications once every one or two years. 

“We have shortened the time required for approval from 10 months to four months, so there has been a tangible surge in the number of acceptances,” she said.

“Because in the past, the period was too long, so successful candidates accepted other job offers. With the year-round recruitment process which has been put in place for some 13 months, we do see an increase in recruitment numbers.”

Yeung also told lawmakers that 3,000 civil servants resigned in the 2023/24 period, a rate of 1.8 percent. She said this was a fall from previous years and was “a really low percentage” compared to the private sector.

“In the private sector, according to statistics, the resignation rate stands at double-digit figures in most cases. So 1.8 percent is a really low figure. Forty percent of those resigning from the service have done so before the end of their probationary period,” she said.

“You could say that perhaps the candidate chosen hasn’t been the right one, and it’s a process for the candidates as well. For the new recruit, early on, if they know that their aspirations and expectations are not met, or if they find themselves unsuited for this post, then they should leave early instead of dragging on.”

Election Committee lawmaker So Cheung-wing said that out of hundreds of thousands of applicants, only around 10,000 people had been recruited, questioning whether it was a matter of quality or whether the bureau is trying to control spending. 

Yeung said it was because many of the applicants weren't up to scratch, adding that money is available to plug the gaps in manpower."

Those included the signing of a free trade agreement with Hong Kong, and updating the existing one with China, its biggest trading partner.

Boluarte also reiterated three thematic priorities - trade and investment for inclusive and interconnected growth; innovation and digitalisation to promote transition to a formal economy; and sustainable growth for resilient development.

Just before making her concluding remarks, the Peruvian leader and her counterparts got together one final time for the family photo, a longstanding tradition for the Apec summit.

After Powell indicated the Fed was in no hurry to cut rates as it monitors inflation's downward trajectory, Wall Street turned red, with all three major indices closing lower.

""Certainly Powell's speech has triggered some skepticism about the path of rates, with potentially December being a skip instead of another cut,"" Edward Jones senior investment strategist Angelo Kourkafas told AFP.

""But we do have another inflation and jobs report before that, so there is still a good sense we might see another rate cut in December,"" he added.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7 percent to 43,444.99, the S&P 500 lost 1.3 percent to 5,870.62 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.2 percent to 18,680.12. 

Leading the way down were a clutch of vaccine-makers' stocks after US President-elect Donald Trump indicated he would appoint vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his health secretary.

In Europe, London was off 0.1 percent, digesting disappointing growth data. Frankfurt and Paris also ended in the red.

Disappointing US retail sales in October did not help overall sentiment as oil prices also drifted down.

In a speech on Thursday, Powell said that ""the economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates.""

While the US central bank is expected to cut interest rates again next month, investors are scaling back their bets on how many cuts will be made next year.

Investors are worried tax cuts and tariffs planned by Trump could reignite inflation.

""The (Trump) administration's renewed focus on tariffs could weigh heavily on currencies of trade-exposed economies, particularly those in Asia and the eurozone,"" said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets.

European markets stuttered as the European Commission predicted economic growth would pick up slightly and inflation would keep falling in the eurozone next year, but warned of growing risks linked to geopolitical tensions. (AFP)"

Real GDP in the third quarter grew by 1.8 percent year-on-year, slower than the 3.2 percent growth in the previous quarter. 

Government economist Adolph Leung said at a press conference that economic growth has been hindered by challenges in the external environment.

""Increased global economic uncertainties and escalation of trade conflicts would affect the performance of our goods exports,"" he said.  

But Leung expressed confidence that the economy will pick up steam, thanks to measures announced by the central and SAR governments to boost market sentiment.

Asked about US President-elect Donald Trump's plan to slap up to 60 percent of tariffs on goods imported from China, Leung said that will have a ""detrimental impact"". 

""It will affect China's exports to the US and also Hong Kong's exports of mainland origin to the US. And I think more than that is that coming along with this kind of trade and economic policy in the US, it will also affect the interest rates outlook."""

The US central bank recently started cutting back its key lending rates from a two-decade high, turning attention from tackling inflation to supporting the labor market as the rate of price increases has moderated.

There has been widespread anger about the cumulative impact of years of inflation, which has pushed up consumer prices by more than 20 percent since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.

But the economic facts today are clear, Powell said during an event in Dallas, Texas, noting that inflation was falling toward the Fed's long-term two percent target, the labor market was ""solid,"" and economic growth remained resilient.

""The recent performance of our economy has been remarkably good, by far the best of any major economy in the world,"" he said.

Powell noted that inflation, as measured by the Fed's favored inflation gauge, was ""running much closer"" to the bank's target, but had not reached it just yet.

""We are moving policy over time to a more neutral setting,"" he said, referring to the level of interest rates over the long run that keep both inflation and unemployment in check.

""But the path for getting there is not preset,"" he added.

Powell said at a Dallas Fed event that with the economy still growing, the job market solid and inflation still above the 2 percent target, the Fed can deliberate carefully on rate cuts.

While traders were still betting on a 25-basis point reduction at the Fed's December meeting, the probability sank to 55.5 percent from 76 percent earlier in the afternoon and from 82.5 percent on Wednesday, the CME Fed Watch tool showed.

""The comments from Powell put more cold water on what used to be a very optimistic outlook on the path for rate cuts,"" said Adam Hetts, global head of Multi-Asset at Janus Henderson Investors.

""However, we can't take for granted that inflation and labor are in balance so this is an encouraging message on the economy.""

Geely Holding, which owns the two marques as well as 10 other automotive brands, has pivoted away from its history of aggressive acquisitions to streamlining its operations and cutting costs.

Group Chairman Eric Li told staff in September that deep integration was needed to improve efficiency and reduce costs. All brands in the group should clarify how their models are positioned to avoid overlap, he added.

Geely said it wants Zeekr and Lynk to form a new energy vehicle manufacturing group with combined annual sales of more than a million units. That compares with about 339,000 vehicles for the two brands in 2023.

""If we don't integrate (Zeekr and Lynk), we must face issues such as internal competition ... and redundant investments in many aspects such as R&D, sales, which is stupid,"" Gui Shengyue, chief executive of Geely Automobile Holdings told a conference call with analysts after the announcement.

""If we don't do it, the overall competitiveness of Geely definitely would not be improved.""

The deal provides for Zeekr to purchase a stake of 30 percent from another group firm, Volvo Cars, and a stake of 20 percent from Geely Holding, the group said in a statement.

Shares in Volvo Cars were up 3.5 percent in early trade, among the biggest gainers on the pan-European STOXX 600 index.

US-listed shares of Zeekr dropped over 7 percent in premarket trading on Thursday after the announcement.

Zeekr will then nudge its stake up to 51 percent with a capital injection while Geely Auto, the group's main listed arm, will continue to own the rest.

The deal values Lynk, a Chinese-Swedish brand, at about 18 billion yuan. It should be completed by June next year, a person with direct knowledge of the plans said. (Reuters)"

But in the end, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 2.6 percent in the 12 months to October, in line with economists' expectations.

""The drivers in large part are the fact that the CPI came in very much in line with expectations, and some buzz in the markets yesterday,"" he said. ""So that coming in line was very much a positive.""

"Bitcoin breaches US$90,000 on Trump support",2024-11-14 01:29,,2024-11-19 15:30,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1778974-20241114.htm,"Bitcoin broke through the US$90,000 level on Wednesday, as its rally showed no signs of easing on expectations that Donald Trump as US president will be a boon for cryptocurrencies.

The world's biggest cryptocurrency has become one of the most eye-catching movers in the week since the election and on Wednesday touched record highs.

It’s value has rocketed up 32 percent since the November 5 election.

Smaller peer ether has risen 37 percent since election day, while dogecoin, an alternative, volatile token promoted by billionaire Trump-ally Elon Musk was up more than 150 percent.

Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.

It is unclear how or when that could happen but the possibility drove a speculative surge in crypto mining and trading stocks.

""Key areas to monitor include potential regulatory changes, increased institutional participation, and a rise in M&A activity,"" said Carl Szantyr, managing partner of digital asset hedge fund Blockstone Capital.

""The new political landscape may bring clearer regulations for crypto assets and could prompt strategic developments, such as a national bitcoin reserve and growth in the mining sector."" (Reuters)"
