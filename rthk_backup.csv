"'Win some, lose some' as two FTU incumbents exit",2025-12-08 17:22,,2025-12-08 17:45,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1835202-20251208.htm,"Hong Kong’s largest labour group has called the defeat of two incumbent lawmakers in the Legislative Council elections a regret, noting there are ""gains and losses"" in this year's polls. 

The Federation of Trade Unions, which fielded 16 candidates, secured seven seats in the legislature. 

They include federation president Stanley Ng, Bill Tang – who's the second-highest among all vote-getters with 53,675 ballots – and Joephy Chan. They each won a directly elected seat. 

But two incumbents from the group, Kwok Wai-keung and Michael Luk, failed to seek re-election after switching to the geographical constituency race. 

""We win some, we lose some. While we have gained new seats, we have also lost two incumbents. This is of course a regret. But it is the overall decision-making and deployment of the federation,"" Ng said.

Kwok expressed regret at the federation's inability to win more seats in the legislature, while hoping other members continue to fight for labour rights. 

Luk told reporters: ""The outcome was a bit disappointing. But I would continue to reflect on in what areas I could do better.""

Other lawmakers-elect include federation chairman Kingsley Wong and Dennis Leung, who both saw success in the Election Committee constituency. Two newcomers, Lee Kwong-yu and Lam Wai-kong, managed to win seats representing the labour sector."

HK stocks slip as policy hopes fuel mainland gains,2025-12-08 17:18,,2025-12-08 17:30,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1835198-20251208.htm,"Mainland stocks advanced on Monday, with insurers and brokers leading gains, as upbeat trade data and top policymakers pledging to support the economy boosted sentiment.

However, in Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index lost 319 points, or 1.23 percent, to end trading at 25,765. The Hang Seng Tech Index closed flat.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was up 21 points, or 0.54 percent, at 3,924 while the Shenzhen Component Index closed 182 points, or 1.39 percent higher, at 13,329 and the ChiNext Index, tracking China's Nasdaq-style board of growth enterprises, gained 80 points, or 2.6 percent, to close at 3,190.

The blue-chip CSI 300 Index jumped 0.8 percent to the highest level since November 14.

The combined turnover of the main Shanghai and Shenzhen indexes stood at 2.04 trillion yuan, up from 1.73 trillion yuan on Friday.

Shares related to computing hardware led gains, while coal, precious metals, and oil and gas sectors were among the top decliners.

China will keep expanding domestic demand and support the broader economy with more proactive measures in 2026, including ""more proactive fiscal policy"" and ""appropriately loose monetary policy"", the Politburo, the top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, said on Monday.

That follows the better-than-expected export data, which was buoyed by a boost from a US tariff truce.

Leading gains, the CSI Investment Banking and Brokerage Index jumped 2 percent and the insurance sector rallied 1.3 percent.

Wu Qing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said on Saturday that the regulator would allow top financial firms to relax capital requirements and leverage limits to work more efficiently.

That came after the insurance sector regulator said on Friday that it would lower the risk factor for insurers holding certain stocks, a move that could reduce capital requirements and free up more funds for investment.

Both announcements showed regulators' loosening stance, which ""will encourage incremental money from institutions into the equity market"", Goldman Sachs said.

Meanwhile, the CSI AI Index jumped 3.1 percent and the chip shares added 2.2 percent, as optimism towards domestic chips continued to buoy the sectors.

The property sector added 0.2 percent to recover from the sell-off last week triggered by Vanke's debt problem.

他又說，自己已是第三屆當選，但今次感受與之前不同，經歷大埔火災，沒太多喜悅。他期望盡快在新一屆立法會，與其他議員一同協助災民及政府，做好重建及撥款工作，若有任何漏洞應盡快填補，不再重蹈覆轍。"

With party chairwoman Ip stepping down from the council, Judy Chan succeeded her in the Hong Kong Island West geographical constituency. 

Dominic Lee and Adrian Ho retained their seats in the New Territories North East and Election Committee constituencies respectively.

Although all five newcomers failed to win a seat, Ip noted that the party gained a similar number of votes as in the previous election – about 11 percent of the total number cast.

Ip said Chan taking over in her seat demonstrates that the party has “passed on the baton” and remains on a healthy development track.

Ip added that the New People's Party will continue to serve as an independent and objective voice in the new legislature.  

She also noted that along with fellow outgoing lawmakers Lai Tung-kwok and Eunice Yung who did not seek re-election, she will continue to lead the party. 

“We'll be continuing to share our expertise in lawmaking and vetting government proposals with our young colleagues, including colleagues from other parties or independent members if they need our help,” she said.  

Ip added that the party is open to working with independent lawmakers and does not rule out the possibility of recruiting new members in the legislature.

Lee expressed gratitude to residents of fire-hit Wang Fuk Court who voted for him, saying he was deeply moved by their support even as they face difficult times.

He vowed to work “in full swing” to promote reforms and further support relief efforts for the fire victims. 

Chan, for her part, said the party’s thoughts are with the victims of the fire, pledging to assist Lee’s efforts in helping those affected."

The party, which fielded 26 candidates, gained one more seat than in the previous term. 

Its candidates achieved a clean sweep in the Election Committee constituency, with all eight elected. 

In the geographical constituencies, it secured one seat in each of the 10 districts. 

Two of its five candidates in functional constituencies were also successful.

Despite gaining a seat, the party's total votes dropped by over a third, from approximately 680,000 to around 430,000. 

DAB chairman Gary Chan said the higher overall voter turnout demonstrated Hong Kong's unity and determination to tackle challenges and drive reform and development. 

However, he acknowledged the vote shift, stating the party would review its strategies and proposals to ensure they resonate with the public.

Vice-chairman Holden Chow pointed to the competitive landscape.

""Take my election as an example, in the last election, there were only three candidates running,"" he said. 

""But in this election, we had five candidates running in my election, so there is a fierce competition among each candidate... that may cause a result of a declining vote of each candidate.""

The election saw two DAB incumbents, Frankie Ngan and Edmund Wong, lose their seats. 

Chan thanked them for their diligent service over the past four years.

Looking forward, the party announced its immediate focus would be to support those affected by the deadly fire at Wang Fuk Court. 

Its first task upon the Legislative Council's return would be to push for rapid reconstruction. 

Chan said the DAB would propose examining a developable plot of land behind Fu Shin Estate for potential use.

In the meantime, he said the party would continue collecting the opinions of those affected by the tragedy.

""Some want to continue living in the Tai Po area, while some prefer not to... therefore, the most important task now is to propose a long-term reconstruction solution, respond to each victim's different demands or property rights issues and then present specific proposals,"" Chan said. 

The party also pledged to support government reforms on building maintenance and safety oversight."
Election 'brings a more inclusive and diverse Legco',2025-12-08 16:16,,2025-12-08 16:45,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1835169-20251208.htm,"Hong Kong's political analysts said on Monday the election had ushered in a more ""inclusive"" and ""diversified"" Legislative Council despite challenges posed by a changing global landscape.

The comments came as more than 1.3 million people cast ballots on Sunday to elect members for the 90-strong legislature, with 40 of them being new faces.

Speaking on RTHK's BackChat programme, Henry Ho, a member of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, said the legislature was set to be more ""inclusive"".

""We have seen some celebrities, or from those sectors you never thought of [before], like Olympic athletes and also retired police [entering the Legco election race],"" he said.

""I think it's important for them ... to have the same starting line. Legco members need to familiarise [themselves] with all sorts of policies within a short period of time, so there may be a steep learning curve. 

""But of course if we have more celebrities in Legco, people may pay more attention to it."" 

Echoing Ho, Andrew Leung, international and independent China strategist, said he hoped the new lawmakers would ""deliver results"", especially given the new global landscape.

""I'm actually quite pleased with the results and the types of candidates and the variety of new individuals and talents entering Legco,"" said Leung, a former director of social welfare.

""But I think that there are huge challenges ahead, not just because of the fire but because Hong Kong and in fact our motherland and the whole world [are] facing unfamiliar circumstances. 

""And the whole world order has been turned upside down. And China is on the cusp of entering a new period with the next five-year plan. And Hong Kong is widely factored into this."" 

There has been, Leung said, an increasing degree of social solidarity, as shown in the aftermath of the fire as well as the election, despite the suspension of campaigning.

""I think this election demonstrates, and also what's happened has demonstrated rightly that the public is fed up with talk shops,"" he said. 

""In the past, many times, Legco has descended into being just a talk shop, fighting each other [with] verbal battles without addressing the real problems facing  different people in the society. I think that this Legco is waking up [to] this fact."""

Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told RTHK that Legco’s agenda was already packed even before the Tai Po fire sparked citywide concern over the rehabilitation of victims whose lives it ruined. 

He cited major tasks ahead such as developing the Northern Metropolis, integrating with national development and driving the industrial transformation.

He said the new lawmakers should learn Legco's rules of procedure and start delivering as soon as possible.

“I hope they can handle all aspects of the work well,"" Lau said. 

""While dealing with disaster relief and recovery, they must not neglect Hong Kong’s economic development and other improvements to people’s livelihoods.” 

Commenting on a voter turnout of 31.9 percent, up 1.7 percentage points from the last election, Lau said many had expected voter enthusiasm to subside after the Tai Po fire.

However, he said the government’s handling of post-disaster relief, its care for victims, and its promises of future reforms before the polls might have won over some voters, making them more willing to cast ballots and contributing to the slight increase in turnout."

內地首11個月累計貿易順差首次突破1萬億美元，達到1.08萬億美元。丁爽預料全年有望再創新高，為經濟提供正面貢獻，但明年出口增速稍為放緩，不會再出現「搶出口」現象。他又表示，考慮到財政刺激仍會保持一定規模，但不一定加碼，預料經濟增速將回歸至與潛在增速相若水平。

他又提到，近兩月內需數據較弱，投資放緩對經濟仍有拖累，消費品以舊換新效應減弱，預料「十五五」時期提振內需尤其消費方面，將有更多政策出台，服務消費潛力仍較大。

他估計，人民銀行明年首季可能降準0.25個百分點，第2季減息10個基點，貨幣政策適度寬鬆，並支持更積極財政政策。"

標普全球料大埔大火索賠影響今年保險業綜合成本率2至3個百分點,2025-12-08 15:47,,2025-12-08 16:15,cfinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1835187-20251208.htm,"市場關注大埔宏福苑大火索賠情況對保險公司的影響。標普全球評級金融服務評級董事李昶潤預計，相關索賠將對今年保險業綜合成本率（Combined Ratio）帶來約2至3個百分點的影響，升至97%至98%。

綜合成本率是保險公司賠付比率及費用率的總和，衡量保險公司整體盈利水平。

李昶潤提到，這類重大損失事件可能促使再保險公司，重新評估於香港財產範疇的整體風險偏好、承保能力和定價合理性，可能會影響明年1月續保再保險的定價。

她指出，在全球和區域再保險市場疲弱的情況下，相信再保險公司的承保能力仍足以維持費率在較低水平。但由於再保險公司承擔了大埔火災大部分損失，日後個別再保險條約談判中可能出現更多調整，例如再保險公司會考慮收緊條款和條件，亦可能考慮除外責任（Exclusions）。"

民建聯在地方選區的總得票由上屆超過68萬票，減至今屆的43萬多票。陳克勤說，會檢討選舉策略及政綱建議是否完全得到市民的認同和支持，又指出今屆每區都有多人參選，各候選人都優秀，很多政綱與民建聯接近及可行，市民多了選擇，令選票流向不同候選人。

陳克勤強調，民建聯會認真地總結今次選舉結果，不斷努力改善工作，回應社會期望。他形容市民投票是支持亦是鞭策，會繼續努力、全程投入支援宏福苑受災居民，立法會復會後第一件事是協助他們盡快重建家園。

他又說，民建聯將會向政府提出重建及賠償方案，包括研究可否使用富善邨後面的「熟地」。由於災民對是否原區或原址居住有不同想法，會因應災民訴求、不同業權情況提出具體方案，並在立法會內支持特區政府落實有關大廈維修和安全監督的改革。"

Lok also appeared emotional in noting that more than 1.3 million people had cast votes, which represents a turnout of 31.9 percent in geographical constituencies amid a sombre atmosphere due to the deadly Tai Po fire, which he believed had raised expectations for the incoming batch of lawmakers."

宏福苑所屬的新界東北選區，投票率為30.15%，相對其他選區低，劉兆佳認為不排除受火災影響，但仍有其他因素吸引當區選民投票，令這區仍有30%的投票率。

民建聯在今次選舉取得20席，增加1席，但得票數目減少36%。劉兆佳說，需要思考是否有新的競爭對手出現，以致民建聯受到一定壓力。對於工聯會維持7席，但有兩名現任議員未能連任，劉兆佳指出，可能因為工聯會參選的地區較為激烈，最終落敗不足為奇。

第六次參選的方國珊成為「票后」，劉兆佳認為在地方選區中，任何一個人長期在地區扎根及服務，加上有一定知名度，入閘議會的機會便增加。而方國珊最終成功，正正反映選民願意獎勵工作表現有目共睹的人成為立法會議員。

至於功能界別方面，部分界別的投票率不足4成，包括教育界及會計界等。劉兆佳表示，一向以來，以中產為主的專業界別較受政治因素影響，不排除部分功能界別選民對目前的政治現狀較為不滿意，導致投票意欲下降。"

In a statement, the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government in the SAR said the smooth conduct of Sunday’s polls demonstrated the strengths of the “One Country, Two Systems” framework, as well as the advanced and effective nature of the new electoral system.

It said the election marked another successful practice in fully implementing the principle of “patriots administering Hong Kong” and in consolidating and developing high-quality democracy suited to the city’s unique circumstances.

A spokesman for the office said the election was conducted lawfully, safely, orderly and smoothly, receiving broad support across society and fully reflecting the will of the people in Hong Kong. 

“The vast majority of voters earnestly fulfilled their civic responsibilities and obligations, casting their votes in solidarity and support for reform,"" he said. 

""A new, high-quality electoral culture has taken deep root in Hong Kong. The elections that are fairer, more just, transparent and incorruptible provide better protection for democracy.""

The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, for its part, called the election a landmark achievement in further consolidating and developing high-quality democracy that conforms to the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle, the Constitution, the Basic Law and the realities of the SAR.

A spokesman pointed out that a deadly fire had occurred in Tai Po during the campaign phase of this election, causing severe trauma to the city. 

Having experienced this major disaster, voters have a deeper understanding of the importance of this election, turning grief into strength and further inspiring their willingness to participate in voting, he said. 

The newly elected members are all outstanding patriots who are capable and dedicated to serving society and have gained the full recognition and support of the majority of voters, he added.

The office said it hoped and believed that the new lawmakers would fully, accurately, and resolutely implement the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle and always uphold national sovereignty, security and development interests as the highest principle.

It also urged them to fully support the Chief Executive and the SAR government to jointly take forward reforms and to carry out post-disaster recovery work, further improve the SAR's governance level and promote long-term prosperity and stability in the city."

The Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong remained the second-largest party in Legco. 

Although it lost all contests in the geographical constituencies, it won a total of eight seats across the functional constituencies and the Election Committee constituency — one fewer than last term. 

The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) kept seven seats. 

Despite taking only three geographical seats, its total votes rose by more than a third, from about 190,000 to 260,000. 

The Liberal Party maintained four seats, three in functional constituencies and one via the Election Committee, 

However, the New People’s Party’s representation halved, dropping from six seats to three.

They are DAB’s Edmund Wong and Frankie Ngan, and the FTU’s Kwok Wai-keung and Michael Luk.

肖遠企在香港出席亞洲保險論壇時指出，隨著全球溫度持續上升，颱風及洪水等極端天氣越加頻繁出現，氣候風險對財產安全、公共衛生、經濟增長造成的影響更為明顯，保險公司需要就承保範圍及投資進行重新定價。他指，氣候變遷亦削弱保險業推出更多新產品的意欲，可能形成供求失衡、保障缺口。而為分散風險，保險公司亦更依賴再保險市場。

他又表示，利率水平受到經濟增長及通脹等因素影響，並沒有任何固定單向利率機制，能夠完全匹配保險的長期限資產及負債，而人壽保險公司投資期更長，利率變化對收益及安全有更深遠影響。

他認為，如果保險業能夠妥善管理實體及轉型風險，有望迎來商機及利潤增長。氣候變遷令民眾對財產保障需求、投保意識大幅提升，形成新需求。

他又提到，科技與金融相輔相成，重大技術革新推動金融業整體增長，人工智能(AI)有助釋巨大潛力，內地很多金融機構正將AI應用於服務，降低成本並提高效率。"

肖遠企在香港出席亞洲保險論壇時指出，內地保險業投資資產與其他非銀行金融機構亦有連結，因而面對較大風險敞口，部分非銀行金融機構不受監管，當局正密切關注，將採取監管措施，包括提高資本及評級要求。

他說，監管機構亦要關注保險公司的商業模式是否具可持續性，以保障投保者及維護金融穩定。當局將把金融機構策略列入重要監管範圍之一，並已進行大量有關評估業務策略的培訓，尤其關注期限是否錯配、成本效益是否匹配。

他指出，內地保險業過去40年一直維持高速增長，部分年份資產增速逾10%至高達20%，現時增長放緩，強調行業正朝著高質量發展。

他指出，當局將更關注保險業務可持續性，並將加強與香港的雙邊合作，支持香港作為國際金融中心的地位，又形容香港保險業高度發達，滲透率在全球處於領先地位。他亦相信，國際溝通及合作有利促進全球保險業發展及改善監管框架。"

Regional markets mixed as fractious Fed meeting looms,2025-12-08 10:33,,2025-12-08 11:00,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1835138-20251208.htm,"Asian shares dithered on Monday as investors bet the farm on a rate cut from the US Federal Reserve this week, yet the meeting could be one of the most fractious in recent memory with some policy makers openly arguing against an easing.

In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index opened down 17 points, or 0.07 percent, at 26,067.

On the mainland, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.16 percent at 3,909 while the Shenzhen Component Index was 0.24 percent higher at 13,178 and the ChiNext Index, tracking China's Nasdaq-style board of growth enterprises, was up 0.32 percent at 3,119.

Markets imply around an 85 percent chance of a quarter-point reduction in the 3.75 percent to 4 percent funds rate, so a steady decision would be a seismic shock. A poll of 108 analysts found only 19 tipping no change, and the rest a cut.

""We expect at least two dissents in favour of no action and that only a slim majority of the 19 FOMC participants will indicate in their updated dots that a December cut was appropriate,"" wrote Michael Feroli, head of US economics at JPMorgan, in a note.

The FOMC, or Federal Open Market Committee, has not had three or more dissents at a meeting since 2019, and that has happened just nine times since 1990.

Feroli also thinks the Fed will cut in January as insurance against a sustained weakening in the labour market, before going on a lengthy policy pause. Markets currently see only a 24 percent chance of a January move and a further easing is not fully priced until July.

Central banks in Canada, Switzerland and Australia also meet this week and all are seen holding steady. The Swiss National Bank might like to ease again to offset the strength of its franc, but is already at 0 percent and reluctant to go negative.

A run of hot economic data has led markets to abandon any hope of another easing from the Reserve Bank of Australia and even price in a rate hike for late 2026.

Hopes for more Fed stimulus has helped support equities in recent weeks, though the risk of a hawkish outlook on Wednesday made for cautious trading. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were both little changed in early action.

Earnings this week from Oracle and Broadcom will test the appetite for all things AI-related, while Costco will provide colour on consumer demand.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.3 percent, after making a modest 0.5 percent gain last week. South Korean stocks eased 0.3 percent, having jumped 4.4 percent last week on confirmation of a lower US tariff on its exports.

Chan – who's been speculated to be among a handful of possible candidates to become Legco president in the coming term – insisted it was too early to think about this.

“I always welcome different capacities, as long as I can give my very best to serve the council, but right now all Legislative Councillors’ concentration should be focused on how to cope with the SAR government to handle the aftermath of the Wang Fuk Court No. 5 alarm fire incident,” Chan said.

“So I think it’s not the right time for anyone to consider personal issues. We should put all our efforts on handling public interest matters first.”

Meanwhile, Nicholas Chan beat Virginia Lee in the legal sector, while the chief executive of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, Grace Chan, won the seat for the social welfare constituency after edging out Fong Fu-fai and Chu Lai-ling.

Many of the winners spoke of the need for the new-term legislature to get to work quickly to hasten relief for victims of the Tai Po fire, and ensure systemic inadequacies that contribute to the spread of the inferno are quickly addressed.

Incumbent Johnny Ng said he would focus on working together with the government to bring in necessary reforms.

""The Chief Executive said the first government motion of the new term would be about the Tai Po fire tragedy,” Ho said.

“I think we need to think about the shortcomings and loopholes to be fixed.""

Hong Kong Council of Social Service chairman Peter Koon also won back his seat.

He says he will work to improve coordination within the social services sector to provide timely assistance to survivors of the Tai Po blaze.

""I think the most important is about regulations – some of them might be outdated,” Koon said.
 
“We need to review some of the regulations, especially the ones on fire safety."" 

Another familiar face, New People's Party's legislator-elect Adrian Ho, said despite the win, this is no time to celebrate as the city continues to grieve the 159 lives lost in the tragedy.
 
""There's so much work that needs to be done regarding the Tai Po fire incident. It's no time to celebrate, we're not in that mode,"" he said.

""I can only said that I'm glad to be wearing the lawmaker-elect hat once again.""

The top vote-getter in the Election Committee constituency was Perry Yiu – who served in the previous Legco term as the representative for the tourism sector functional constituency.

Yiu, who received 1,397 votes out of 1,458 ballots cast, thinks being candidate number one out of 50 hopefuls had helped his numbers.

He said he was honoured to receive the trust of the voters, adding that he’s used to coordinating between different sectors and believes that he can make greater contributions as an Election Committee lawmaker.

Yan Chan was the “vote queen” of the Election Committee – garnering the second most votes, just 11 behind Yiu.

She said councillors-elect all want to get to work very soon during these challenging times.

""Health issues must be among my top priorities, because we're facing shortages of doctors and nurses. We're also facing an ageing problem. So I wish to discuss more in Legco how to tackle the ageing problem with artificial intelligence,"" she said.

New faces set to join the Election Committee constituency are include former president of the Law Society, Thomas So, and the former chairman of the Junior Police Officers’ Association, Joe Chan."
