Cruise hub operators 'showing interest in Kai Tak',2026-01-02 13:50,,2026-01-02 14:15,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1838356-20260102.htm,"Tourism Commissioner Angelina Cheung on Friday said a number of cruise terminal operators had expressed interest in taking over the Kai Tak facility since the government's launch of an open tender last month.

Speaking on RTHK’s Backchat programme, she emphasised that the new operator had to be able to hold events at the terminal when it wasn't hosting any cruise ships.

“Of course, cruise deployment is always a priority. It is a cruise terminal, so we will always give priority for cruises coming to Hong Kong. We welcome all cruises from around the world,” Cheung said.

“During the low season or when there's... no cruise ship coming, we expect the new operator to consider holding more events at the terminal.

""And that's why in this tender, we have consolidated the management, and we will include the public spaces, including the rooftop garden, as well as two podium gardens on the second floor... under the management of the operator.""

Cheung also said Kai Tak Sports Park had attracted some cruise passengers to Hong Kong for concerts and sports events.

“Our policy is actually a plus tourism idea. That means everything plus tourism. You could bring out the tourism angle,” she said.

“This kind of packaging we are doing not only between the terminal and the sports park but everything across the city.

""We have so many attractions and there could be a lot of packaging with attractions, with theme parks, and also with arts events, cultural events or great performances throughout Hong Kong.

""We are doing a lot of these promotions and collaborations between different parties so as to enhance the attractiveness of Hong Kong.”

Bids will be welcome until May 22, and Cheung said the new operator would need to start work six months before mid-2028 before the contract of the current operator expires.

By then, the new operator should have the full team in place, and this would include a head manager, a cruise terminal manager and a leasing manager, who will oversee commercial leases and events.

The future operator and manager of Kai Tak Cruise Terminal will have to comply with four new key performance indicators – the number of annual ship calls, the number of annual non-cruise-related events and visitors brought by them, as well as the occupancy rate of nearby commercial areas."

The Cold Weather Warning, issued on Thursday afternoon, remains in force.

The Observatory noted this is the first time since 1999 that no cold weather warning was issued in either November or December, with the warning arriving only now, in January.

It forecasts the weather will remain cold on Saturday morning. 
  
People that RTHK spoke to are embracing the fine, cool weather. 

""I see so many people wearing like multiple layers, but I find it really refreshing. Initially this morning, I was just wearing T‑shirt, but because I know the temperature drops quite significantly, I changed to long sleeves and some sort of like layers just to keep me warm. Although I understand why people find it very, very cold this morning, it's a good weather overall,"" one resident said.  

Other residents shared their own tips on how to dress for the weather.

""On the harbour, the breeze is definitely more noticeable compared to when you're inland. It's a cold breeze because it's off the ocean, so you definitely need to consider putting on a jumper or something. Just dress appropriately, I guess, and layers you can take off,"" one man said. 

""When I'm in the shade, it's very cold. When I'm in the sun, I think I've got too much on. So, yeah, it's difficult to balance what to wear when you're in Hong Kong."" another man said."

Mainland chipmaker Biren opens IPO race with a bang,2026-01-02 13:11,,2026-01-02 13:30,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1838353-20260102.htm,"Shares of mainland AI chip designer Shanghai Biren Technology surged on their Hong Kong debut on Friday, kicking off the financial hub's first listing of 2026 with a bang.

Biren shares opened at HK$35.70 each, above the offer price of HK$19.60.

The strong debut follows a blockbuster year for Hong Kong's equity market in 2025 and heralds a wave of chip and AI offerings this year.

Biren raised HK$5.58 billion by selling 284.8 million H shares at HK$19.60 each, the top of a marketed range.

Institutional demand was nearly 26 times the shares on offer, while the retail tranche was oversubscribed about 2,348 times, exchange filings showed.

Founded in 2019, Biren develops general-purpose graphics processing units and intelligent computing systems for artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.

Its co-founders include Zhang Wen, a former president at SenseTime, and Jiao Guofang, who previously worked at Qualcomm and Huawei.

During the listing ceremony in Hong Kong, Zhang said Hong Kong would become a key place for the company's development.

""As one of the first key high‑tech firms brought into Hong Kong, we deeply feel the city’s emphasis on and support for hard‑tech startups,"" he said.

""Hong Kong’s excellent business environment and its efficient link to global capital will become an important platform for Biren Technology and other companies to develop in Hong Kong.""

Zhang also said his aim would be to create value for its shareholders, employees and the community.

""The listing is not the end but a brand‑new beginning,"" he said.

""Starting today, Biren Technology will become a public company and will also shoulder greater social responsibility.

""We will invest even more resolutely in technological innovation and will do a better job in managing the business, creating long‑term value for shareholders, employees and society, repaying every ounce of trust placed in us, and live up to the opportunities this era offers.""

Separately, mainland internet search leader Baidu said on Friday its AI chip unit Kunlunxin had filed a Hong Kong IPO application, confirming a Reuters report in early December.

Hong Kong's IPO pipeline includes AI startups and chipmakers, with Zhipu AI and Iluvatar CoreX to debut next on January 8. (Additional reporting by Reuters)"

他表示，中央港澳辦近日發文，充分肯定香港過去一年在經濟、金融等領域所取得的顯著成就，並對特區未來發展寄予期望。對於香港去年全球金融中心排名第三、港股IPO規模排榜首、恒生指數表現亮眼、駐港公司數目創新高，許正宇說，這些成績得來不易，是特區政府與金融業界共同努力，亦得益於中央大力支持，以及國家高質量發展帶動。

Hotels on song as mainlanders stay for the holiday,2026-01-02 11:36,,2026-01-02 12:00,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1838331-20260102.htm,"A hotel representative on Friday said mainlanders had stayed longer in Hong Kong over the New Year period as they enjoyed a three-day holiday this year.

Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, the chief operations officer at Miramar Group, Alan Chan, said the company's hotels in Tsim Sha Tsui and Wan Chai were fully occupied over the holiday and saw room prices surge up to 15 percent compared to last year.

""Most visitors stayed for two nights... A minority of them had been here since Christmas, which was rare in the past, and that might have been because Japan had been replaced as a travel destination.""

Chan, who is also a lawmaker, said concerts held by singers Zhou Shen at Kai Tak Stadium and Jacky Cheung at Hong Kong Coliseum were a boon for hotels in Kowloon.

More than half of the audience at Zhou's concerts on December 31 and January 1, were from the mainland, he said, and these fans were willing to dig deeper into their pockets even though hotel rooms had cost more than last year, to celebrate the New Year with the singer.

This, Chan pointed out, might have compensated for the cancellation of the fireworks display, Chan added.

Looking ahead, he expects more visitors, particularly business travellers, to come to the city with the present easing in the Sino-US trade war.

Chan also said that the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, which is currently undergoing an open tender for a new operator and manager, would also help bring in more high-end tourists.

Both business and high-end overnight visitors, he pointed out, are crucial to boosting spending in Hong Kong."

The gains soon raced past 1.8 percent while the Hang Seng Tech Index, which represents the 30 largest technology companies listed, was up 3.3 percent shortly after the opening and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index jumped over 1.9 percent.

Generally, however, moves across asset classes were muted, with momentum in early trade carrying over from a year-end rally while liquidity remained low due to the holidays.

Precious metals extended their stellar run from last year, with spot gold up 0.9 percent to US$4,351 an ounce, while spot silver jumped two percent to US$72.63 per ounce.

Gold's 2025 rise was its biggest in 46 years, while silver and platinum made their largest gains on record, driven by a cocktail of factors including the US Federal Reserve's rate cuts, geopolitical flashpoints, robust central bank buying and ETF inflows.

Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's head of macro research for Asia ex-Japan, ⁠said the rally also underscores ""hedges against entrenching USD debasement risks"".

連瑋翹在本台節目《千禧年代》表示，以一個4人家庭為例，如果全家人都需要申請減免，需要提供包括過去半年的銀行月結單等文件，可能已有數百頁紙，假如相關家庭沒有電腦或打印機亦沒有網上銀行，要取得這些文件，在一定程度上都是負擔。

他建議醫管局可否進一步優化流程，例如連繫相關申請人已有的政府援助或津貼，減少重覆審核。如果申請人從未申領政府任何津貼，亦可考慮以自我申報形式處理減免申請，之後再作抽查。他說，接觸到的個案，許多時要去醫院3至4次處理相關申請手續，亦要先約見醫務社工，市民可能都要請多日假期方能處理，對基層人士或會造成一定困難。"

央視新聞就報道，西部另一個省洛雷斯坦一間警局，昨日遭受暴徒襲擊，造成3人死亡、17人受傷。在衝突中，暴徒攜帶各種冷兵器及槍械進入警局，意圖襲擊警員並搶奪武器，雙方爆發衝突。施襲期間，暴徒向警員投擲石塊，損毀並焚燒多架警車。警方宣布已從暴徒手中繳獲多支槍械。

有人權新聞網站報道，南部法爾斯省一個城市有抗議活動；一個人權組織就指西部3個省有示威者被當局拘留。

伊朗革命衛隊表示，下屬一個志願準軍事部隊有成員喪生，十多人受傷，指責示威者利用抗議活動製造事端。面對蔓延多地的示威，德黑蘭當局在採取安全應對措施的同時，亦提出對話建議。政府發言人昨日表示，當局會與工會及商戶代表直接對話，但未有透露細節。

過去的星期日，伊朗有商舖開始抗議政府對貨幣急劇貶值及物價飆升問題處理不當，到周二多間大學有學生加入示威，抗議活動蔓延至全國，更有升級跡象。

伊朗貨幣里亞爾近日大幅貶值，通脹削弱民眾的購買力。總統佩澤希齊揚試圖緩和緊張局勢，承認示威者的訴求合理，要求採取行動改善經濟，又指從伊斯蘭角度來看，人民的生計問題必須解決。總檢察長就說，任何人企圖將和平經濟示威轉變為破壞社會安寧、破壞公共財產工具的行徑，或實施外部謀劃的亂局，將遭到合法及果斷回應。"

調查亦顯示，中產階級流動資產門檻已大幅提升至835萬元。隨著股市回升，受訪者對物業租金收入的依賴減少，而「現金為王」的心態亦逐漸淡化。

在退休規劃方面，近7成受訪者傾向靈活退休模式，為實現理想退休生活，受訪者目標每月被動收入達48580元。另外，超過9成的受訪者重視跨代規劃，並著重於將財富傳承給孫輩。"

中大醫學院化學病理學系教授呂愛蘭表示，團隊從實驗室新生小鼠身上發現，小鼠出生7天之內若心臟受損，Treg 細胞會刺激「染色質調控蛋白MRG15」的數量增長，若將Treg 細胞或這種蛋白移除，心肌細胞再生能力會顯著減弱，如重新注射這種蛋白，心臟能夠恢復大部分再生功能。

呂愛蘭指出，成人的心肌細胞一旦受損就無法再生，但新生兒的心臟，即使受損也有短暫而顯著的修復及再生能力，這種能力會隨著年齡增長而消失。人類胎兒亦有很高數量的MRG15蛋白，成年人就很少，情況與實驗室老鼠一致。

她表示，今次是全球首次發現這項心肌再生的關鍵機制，研究團隊1年內會進一步公布在成年老鼠身上的實驗結果，之後再於人類進行臨床研究。"

半官方的法爾斯通訊社報道，西部洛雷斯坦省有示威者闖入警局與警方衝突，並縱火焚燒警車，至少三人死亡，17人受傷。在恰哈馬哈勒-巴赫蒂亞里省的洛爾德甘市，示威者向政府辦公室等建築物擲石，安全部隊使用催淚氣體驅散，兩人死亡。西部城市庫赫達什特和中部伊斯法罕省亦各有一人喪生。

自商戶在過去的星期日發起抗議以來，全國各地的動盪局勢顯著升級，至少10間大學的學生星期二加入示威後，抗議活動迅速蔓延。德黑蘭方面表示，將會與工會及商家代表直接對話。

伊朗貨幣里亞爾兌美元在過去一年貶值超過三分一，而雙位數的通脹亦削弱民眾的購買力。

總統佩澤希齊揚試圖緩和緊張局勢，承認示威者的訴求合理，呼籲政府採取行動改善經濟。他指出，從伊斯蘭教的角度來看，如果不解決人民的生計問題，最終將會落地獄。

伊朗總檢察長就說，和平的經濟抗議活動是合法，但任何企圖制造混亂的行為，都會遭到果斷回應。"

對於有目擊者表示，是香檳酒樽上的生日蠟燭引燃天花板，又指酒吧出口狹窄，導致很難疏散。總檢察長回應說，當局會調查起火原因，目前無法確認任何事，工作亦需要時間，當局有幾個關於起火原因的假設，目前最可能的結論是一場普通火警引發大火。

帕姆蘭形容，大火是瑞士歷來最嚴重悲劇之一，是一場規模空前的災難，向遇難者家屬表示慰問，宣布將會取消新年致辭，瑞士聯邦宮亦會下半旗五日致哀。

他說，當局正透過各國外交部與外國遇難者的家屬聯繫，對表態願意提供援助的國家表示感謝。"

莫斯科任命的烏克蘭南部赫爾松州州長表示，敵人出動三架無人機襲擊當地一間咖啡店和酒店，當時過百名平民正在慶祝新年，襲擊導致一幢建築物被燒毀。俄方表示，襲擊造成20多人死亡，多人受傷，指責烏方發動恐怖襲擊，蓄意破壞尋求和平解決衝突的努力，警告基輔將面臨相應後果。

烏克蘭總統澤連斯基就說，俄羅斯將戰爭延續至新一年，一夜之間發射超過200架無人機，主要目標是烏方的能源設施。烏克蘭電力營運商表示，大量用戶的電力供應中斷，鐵路和港口基礎設施亦在砲擊中遭到破壞。

另外，俄羅斯國防部表示，已成功解碼一架幾天前被擊落烏克蘭無人機的任務數據，確認攻擊目標是總統普京的官邸，相關資料會交給美國方面。

烏方一直否認襲擊普京官邸，批評俄方的說法純屬捏造，意在破壞烏方與美方團隊合作的成果，並為繼續襲擊烏克蘭制造藉口。"

馬姆達尼在就職演說中，強調公共交通對城市發展的重要性，指這座車站見證公共交通對紐約城市活力、公共健康及歷史傳承的重要意義。

完成宣誓後，馬姆達尼依照程序向市書記官辦公室繳納9美元，並在登記簿上簽名，正式就任紐約市第111任市長。

34歲的馬姆達尼1991年在烏干達出生，移民紐約後加入美國國籍，是紐約市一個多世紀以來最年輕的市長，同時亦是當地史上首位穆斯林市長。

他在競選期間表示，當選後要解決民眾生活成本高昂的問題，提出巴士免費、提高最低時薪、向富人加稅等措施。

共和黨籍的總統特朗普曾經威脅，如果馬姆達尼當選，就會扣起對紐約市的聯邦撥款，並考慮派遣國民警衛隊進駐當地，但特朗普去年11月邀請馬姆達尼到白宮會面時，氣氛友善，令外界感到意外。

不過，美聯社認為，鑑於兩人在政策上存在深刻分歧，尤其在移民問題上，他們之間的緊張關係幾乎肯定會再次出現。

馬姆達尼亦因為對以色列政府的批評，而面臨市內部分猶太社區成員的質疑和反對。"

警方凌晨約3時接獲事主母親報案，翻查大量閉路電視情報調查和分析後，下午在葵涌拘捕該名13歲少女，並在她家中尋回犯案時的衣著。

特區政府強烈譴責英國廣播公司就黎智英健康狀況作出不實報道,2026-01-01 22:35,,2026-01-01 23:15,local,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1838301-20260101.htm,"特區政府強烈譴責英國廣播公司，刻意作出有關黎智英健康狀況的不實報道，企圖捏造事實誤導公眾，刻意為黎智英塑造悲情形象，目的是掩飾其作惡多端並被法庭定罪的事實。

發言人表示，英國廣播公司在報道中所指有關黎智英的健康情況失實並極具誤導性。特區政府已多次指出懲教署在處理黎智英的羈押安排時，跟其他在囚人士一視同仁，署方一直極為重視在囚人士的安全及健康，不論在囚人士的身分、年齡和國籍，一直致力為其提供安全、人道、合適和健康的羈管環境，包括提供合適和及時的醫療支援，強調黎智英羈押期間所獲得的醫療服務是完備的。

發言人提到，懲教署過去曾經因應黎智英的齒科護理需要，提供牙齒診治，自此黎智英的牙齒沒有出現過健康問題，亦沒有就齒科護理方面提出過任何訴求。懲教署早前於公開法庭聆訊前安排黎智英就所指稱心悸問題佩帶醫療儀器及處方心臟藥物，直至目前，黎智英沒有再就心悸問題向懲教署作出任何訴求，因此黎智英女兒所作的指控，以及包括英國廣播公司在內的有關媒體報道完全是毫無事實根據。

發言人認為，別有用心人士對事實視而不見，繼續重複謊言和作出卑劣操作，他的女兒近日更不斷企圖惡意抹黑香港特區政府和懲教署，令公眾誤信黎智英的羈押和醫療服務安排惡劣，卑劣用心昭然若揭，特區政府對此堅決反對，並予以強烈譴責。

發言人強調，香港特區是法治社會，一直秉持有法必依、違法必究的原則。《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》明確訂明防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪，應當堅持法治原則，倡議某種背景的人或組織不應就違法行為和活動受到法律制裁，等同給予其犯法特權，完全違反法治精神。"

As head of a working group on tourist hotspots, Cheuk said this is the second film-themed exhibition, following one last year about Kowloon Walled City, and that they formed part of nine tourism hotspot projects announced previously.

""We hope to combine Hong Kong's film culture with tourism to enrich cultural and travel experiences, thereby driving the local economy,"" he said.

""Even though the exhibition area isn't large for now, it is rich in content, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in the highlights and iconic scenes of classic police films. We might even expand it in the future.""

The fixed penalty for illegal parking – which has remained unchanged for more than three decades – is up from HK$320 to HK$400.

Fines for 19 other traffic-related offences have also been raised from a range of between HK$320 and HK$1,000 to between HK$480 and HK$1,500.

“The increased fine did have a deterrent effect,” a driver, Fung, told RTHK.

""I don’t dare to park my car illegally. I either park it at on-street parking spaces or in car parks. The fine will improve traffic flows.""

Another motorist believes, however, there is no deterrent effect.

“If people can’t find a parking space, they’ll just park on the street, there’s no other option,"" he said.

""For example, in Tsim Sha Tsui on a busy day, you’ll never find a spot.”

Yet another driver said he believed the fine for illegal parking had been set too high given the current state of the economy."

陳國基在社交網站說，新一屆立法會選舉產生後，政府已與不少候任議員進行了形式多樣的交流，聽到許多貼地且具有建設性的意見。他深切感受到各位議員對香港的熱誠與擔當，大家都展現出務實有為、創新進取的良好姿態，行政立法良性互動的基礎非常扎實。

他和團隊未來會繼續以開放、誠懇的態度，與立法會保持緊密溝通和高效合作。政府將在政策醞釀階段便積極聽取意見，讓施政更符合實際，更貼近民意；在法案審議過程中坦誠交流、充分研商，完善各項立法建議；在政策落實時加強協作，確保促發展、惠民生措施能夠有效推行。"
