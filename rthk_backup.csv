The dedicated ""Technology Enterprises Channel"", announced by the Financial Secretary Paul Chan in his budget speech in February, is aimed at boosting the appeal of the city's fundraising capability amid growing appetite among mainland firms for raising funds offshore. 

Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) will set up a dedicated team to communicate with firms to provide support for their listing applications.

""Our aim is to enhance understanding of the relevant listing rules among enterprises and sponsors and to conduct preliminary communications with them on different important topics, such as the applicability and assessment of the firms' specific businesses,"" Lee said.

""The Securities and Futures Commission will also closely cooperate with HKEX to provide support during the process.

""With better preparations made by the relevant firms, we hope to make their application process smoother and more convenient, allowing more different technology firms to list in Hong Kong.""

He added that more details on the scheme will be provided by the HKEX later in the day.

Lee also noted that the city has opened up new opportunities for scientific and technological innovation cooperation between Zhejiang and Hong Kong – following a visit to the mainland's southeastern region during which the two sides set up a mechanism to strengthen collaboration in 13 key areas covering more than 50 projects.

The SAR government, he said, will provide more assistance for tech firms to speed up the development of applications of technologies after having exchanges with representatives from six local tech firms in Hangzhou that are known as the ""Six Little Dragons"".

Lee said such visits have also promoted investments by Zhejiang enterprises in Hong Kong as some enterprises there plan to set up headquarters and research and development centres in the SAR and that over half of those planned projects will be implemented this year."

In a statement, the consumer watchdog said Wong has been dedicated to promoting and protecting consumer rights and interests and overseen the council's digital transformation.

""Under her leadership, the Council has continued to promote consumer protection and deftly navigated today’s increasingly complex and ever-changing consumption environment with a forward-thinking mindset,"" the council's chairman Clement Chan wrote in the statement. 

Wong also served as the vice president of Consumers International’s Board of Trustees, an organisation advocating consumer rights around the world.

In response, she said she was honoured to lead the council and safeguard consumer rights during her term. 

Wong added that it is a suitable time to leave the position, after the watchdog celebrated its 50th anniversary last year and laid out its three-year plan. 

She was stepping down upon completion of her contract.

Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau hailed Wong's work.

""The council has been keeping pace with the times, including stepping up publicity and education to protect consumer rights and interests in response to the growing popularity of online shopping, as well as assisting elderly consumers to strengthen their self-protection capabilities,"" Yau said in a statement. 

The council's deputy chief executive Francis Ho will become the interim chief executive until a successor to Wong is named."

The alleged move by the medical group, which offered services such as prepaid inoculation packages and body checks, prompted the government to set up a task force. 

On Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee warned that people linked to the suspected shutdown of the clinics would be held accountable. 

He also said the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau will review existing laws and submit a report as soon as possible. 

""The government will examine whether the existing regulations are adequate, particularly for prepaid consumption, and consider various proposals, including the introduction of a statutory cooling-off period, limiting the maximum contract period, and addressing industry operational conditions,"" Lee said. 

He said customs and police officers will probe the incident, while the Consumer Council will exercise its authority to safeguard the rights of customers. 

The authorities are offering ""feasible assistance"" to affected individuals by allowing children who are eligible to get their remaining vaccinations at government health centres, Lee added."

林民聰在本台節目《千禧年代》說，目前政府正與12間機構緊密聯繫，包括進行系統對接、人員培訓等，預計新安排將於今年第四季或之前陸續推展，預計全港有178萬名合資格長者受惠。他說，長者醫療券的使用方法及服務範疇與以往一樣，不需要預先登記，但提醒内地大部分門診服務都可以事先預約，長者可更快捷得到所需的服務。

工聯會立法會議員黃國在同一節目說，近年越來越多長者退休後，選擇到内地安老，相信新安排能解決他們的醫療需要，但關注有部分服務，例如深圳的牙科服務特別受港人歡迎，認為未來可進一步擴闊適用機構。目前東莞只有一間機構可使用長者醫療券，黃國說，東莞有不少港人居住，仍有擴大的空間，希望政府今年底進行檢討，針對港人較集中的地點，再逐步擴大試點計劃的適用範圍。"

邱金榮在本台節目《千禧年代》說，部分社區由於欠缺遊客，生意有如平時。他又指港人到內地消費對餐飲業界的影響大，例如昨日、即黃金周最後一天，明顯看到晚市生意額下跌。

邱金榮認為，黃金周固然對餐飲業有很大幫助，之後亦要觀察包括母親節的生意，因為節日對業界有幫助。

被問到有否針對內地旅客推出優惠，邱金榮表示，有一定難度，業界需要多了解社交平台小紅書等熱門媒體宣傳，並且要投放金錢才會有效果，他認為本港食肆目前仍未夠成熟，需要有適應期。"

Ahead of Tuesday's Executive Council meeting, Chief Executive John Lee also said the SAR should welcome all types of tourists and cater to their needs. 

The city welcomed 1.1 million tourists in the first five days of the month, up around 22 percent from the same period last year. Friday saw the most mainland arrivals – 267,000. 

The chief executive said officials will study the use of technology for crowd control and learn what tourists are interested in nowadays.

iFast Global Markets投資總監溫鋼城預料，銀行體系總結餘不會重返3000億至4000億水平，原因是當年美國聯儲局正進行量化寬鬆。

華僑銀行香港經濟師姜靜表示，美國貿易保護主義抬頭及財赤問題，影響美元信心，導致亞洲貨幣兌美元轉強。派息及新股活動，亦令港元流動性收緊，預料港元短期持續貼近7.75港元兌1美元，金管局或持續入市。她預料，隨著流動性轉鬆，港元利率下跌趨勢會較為跟足美息。"

謝邱安儀指出，協會會員一致認為，五天黃金周只是頭兩日的零售情況較好，第三日之後的生意已回落不少，業界目前可以「跑數」的時間不長，仍然處於較困難狀況。

她說生意上升的種類包括化妝品及個人護理，下跌的類別包括服裝和電子產品；而現時旅客經常說「窮遊」，即使單價不算很高，旅客亦會著重性價比，不代表部分較高單價的類別沒有生意。

謝邱安儀提到，復活節假期較少內地旅客，而且有很多港人外遊，今個五一假期，多了港人留港，都帶動到比平時的周末有較好的生意額。

被問到基於今次黃金周情況，是否適合再擴展更多自由行城市，她認為除了深圳等鄰近區域，見到較偏遠省市的內地旅客，如果一簽多行等政策可再開放至更多城市，一定會幫助到來港人流。

對於內地旅客消費模式轉變，改為去郊區，零售業界有否考慮在郊區設多些零售點，謝邱安儀說，這方面的討論暫時較少，旅客到郊區的目的未必是消費，主要是觀光及「打卡」，業界始終期望吸引多些為消費來港的旅客。"

Retailers mostly see growth over Golden Week,2025-05-06 11:11,,2025-05-06 11:45,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1803363-20250506.htm,"The Retail Management Association said on Tuesday most businesses have had a better Labour Day Golden Week compared to a year ago.

The growth in retail sales came as more than 910,000 mainland visitors headed to the SAR during the five-day holiday that concluded on Monday.

Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, chairwoman Annie Yau Tse pointed out that business was slightly better than a normal weekend.

""If we look at local consumption, as mentioned before, there were fewer people making outbound trips compared to the Easter break,"" she said. 

""And of the five-day Golden Week, four of them were public holidays, while there were only three last year.

""So given that there were more public holidays and fewer people leaving Hong Kong, these helped business. 

""Also the weather was better compared to last year.""

A low base effect from last year, Yau Tse pointed out, also contributed to the growth.

However, she said, the business environment remains difficult, as sales edged down after the first two days of the Golden Week.

Sales of furniture, leisure clothing, eyewear and electronics increased despite these retail segments usually seeing a dip when they showed up in monthly figures, while declines were recorded for shops selling personal care products and food.

Even though mainland tourists usually travel on low budgets, she said, that does not mean that they would not go in for high-priced products as they look for items with high-cost effectiveness.

Yau Tse believes if the multi-entry permits that was restored for Shenzhen residents last year could be expanded to cover more provinces, it would boost the flow of visitors to the SAR."

另外，李家超出席行政會議前表示，早前率團訪問浙江有三大成果，包括提升了浙港全方位合作，建立了合作會議機制，並已啟動首次會議，確立13個重點領域共50個項目，雙方亦簽署了4份合作文件，涵蓋科技創新、住房安居、青年發展，當局亦積極推動兩地持續發揮合作平台的作用，同時建立專班針對兩地合作領域，深度推展不同合作的可能性。

李家超說，另一項成果是開拓了浙港科創合作的新機遇，他在當地訪問了很多科創項目，包括與杭州六小龍的代表進行交流；最後促進了浙江企業在香港的投資，當地企業計劃來港設總部及研發中心等，超過半數項目將在今年落地。

他表示，在杭州與六小龍代表交談中，最大體會是科創方面的應用場景，應由政府盡量提供協助，因為新產品需要經過不斷的應用場景和實驗改良，才可達到最佳效果，令他聯想起低空經濟，特區政府很努力開創很多無人機的實地應用場景，並會繼續與業界探討。"

SAR a nexus for mainland firms to the world: InvestHK,2025-05-06 10:21,,2025-05-06 10:45,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1803360-20250506.htm,"Hong Kong has what it takes to help mainland firms expand into international markets, according to InvestHK – the government department responsible for attracting foreign investment. 

Last month, Chief Executive John Lee led a delegation to Zhejiang province, where he attended an investment promotion conference in Ningbo. It's part of a broader push by the SAR administration to open up new investment opportunities. 

In an exclusive interview with RTHK, InvestHK's director-general, Alpha Lau, said Zhejiang is not only the traditional cradle for supply chain and trading companies, it is also known for being a thriving IT hub that has produced six rapidly emerging tech companies. 

""We call it the Six Little Dragons. So it's a very, very rich location of companies which might have global aspirations... and where we hope to increase our collaboration between the two locations so that they could use Hong Kong as a stepping stone or springboard into their international expansion,"" she said. 

""InvestHK signed MOUs with 12 companies… those are the ones willing to go on stage. Obviously there are many other deals that we are discussing."" 

Lau said that just days after the trip, she has already received a delegation from Ningbo and work is underway to help the firm set up shop in Hong Kong. 

The InvestHK chief explained that the SAR has a lot to offer these companies, especially in areas like research and development. 

""Hong Kong has an abundance of international talent in this area and five of the top 100 universities in the world who have got a lot of research capabilities,” she said. 

Apart from the mainland, Lau pointed out that the government is also tapping into investment opportunities in places like India and the Middle East. 

""What I have seen as a trend is that the region as a whole, they are very strong in resources related companies and also some development like hotels, more traditional type companies. But they're very forward looking in terms of planning for the future.""

Another region that InvestHK will focus its efforts on is Eastern Europe, including Hungary and Turkey. 

“What we’re hoping to do there is to raise awareness. Eastern Europe countries know China well, but they don’t know Hong Kong as a hub well,” she said."

受到關稅影響，新接業務量增速減慢，積壓工作量回升。不過，旅遊業增長帶動外需改善，新增出口業務微升。

企業樂觀度下滑至逾5年新低，成本因素導致服務業持續壓縮人手規模，但薪酬成本上升推高經營費用，原材料價格亦升。市場競爭加劇，企業普遍提供折扣及減價，以支撐銷售。

另外，財新中國4月綜合PMI跌至51.1，低於3月的51.8，由於製造業及服務業產出增速都放緩。

財新表示，當前經濟發展不利因素仍較多，尤其外部貿易環境不確定，對企業影響較大，預料中美關稅博弈對經濟的負面影響將於第2、3季逐步顯現，政策要有充分準備，並適度靠前發力。"

The S&P 500 fell 36 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,650. The decline broke the benchmark index's longest winning streak since 2004.

Ten-time champion Jason Kwok defended his title as ""Bun King"", and ice climber Janet Kung won the title of ""Bun Queen"". 

Nine male and three female finalists clambered up a 14-metre tall bun tower at the same time. Those climbers who filled their bags with the most buns in three minutes won the most points. 

Kung, 31, also claimed the title ""Queen of Bun Queens"" after her third victory.

""Earning this title is a milestone for me, after participating in this game for nine years,"" she said.

""I will continue joining the bun-scrambling competition. It's a sports event that I have to join every year. It is just like a report card of my fitness and attitude every year, and see whether I've improved. So far I've been improving.""

Firefighter Kwok said he didn't expect to win as a Bun King again this year.

""My opponents are tough. I was worried that they would take the win. At my age, it's the taking part that counts. I'm just happy to be here,"" he said.

He said his winning strategy was to climb fast to the top and snag those nine-point buns before others.

Over 100 people queued early to get free tickets for the event. One attendee surnamed Cheung said he arrived at 5 am on Monday.

""I want a good spot. I've been watching the contests for more than a decade,"" he said.

""I'm not a Cheung Chau resident, but after all these years, it's just second nature. If I skip watching it, I get this itch. It's like catching up with old friends every year. No matter how long it takes to stand in line to watch the event, I don't care. I can tough it out.""

許正宇在本台電視節目《政正關你事》說，香港是一個低稅制的城市，沒有遺產稅、股息稅、資本利得稅、消費稅等，對家族辦公室、企業或個人落戶香港都十分有吸引力。

他又說，過去十多年特區政府做了很多工作，致力聯通內地的股票、債券、交易所買賣基金等市場，新興經濟和科技相關企業的市值亦佔本港整體股市超過四分之一，相信這些因素令中東資金有興趣來港投資。

許正宇指出，現時香港有超過2700間單一家族辦公室，反映本港作為家族辦公室樞紐的角色非常清晰和穩健，期望今年內能再吸引至少200間家族辦公室落戶香港。"

To get the best spot, many of them had already arrived on the island hours before the Piu Sik parade – featuring about 20 floats – kicked off at 1.30pm.

Children, who were held up on stilts and paraded through the Cheung Chau streets, dressed up as prominent figures ranging from Financial Secretary Paul Chan to snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan – who recently become a Hong Kong resident.

Ahead of the National Games in November, the young performers also personified diving queen Quan Hongchan and local fencing sensation Edgar Cheung.

A child was also dressed up as Ne Zha, the titular character from the mainland blockbuster animation Ne Zha 2.

Jakub, who moved to Hong Kong from the Middle East last August, was one of many who travelled to the outlying island for the parade.

""We like the festival, we like old traditions, and it's quite [a] famous festival, so we would like to see it. It's amazing. It's great but the weather is too hot today. But it's great,"" he told RTHK.

Earlier before noon, queues had already formed outside bakeries offering lucky buns stamped with peace messages.

A shopkeeper told RTHK that business at his bakery, which sells the white lucky buns with pink lettering, surged 10 percent compared to last year, exceeding his expectations.

""As we work in the retail and catering industries, we knew that consumption is weak,"" he said. ""So we didn't expect sales to be as good as last year.""

But he noted that there were not many mainland tourists visiting the island for the festival despite the Labour Day Golden Week. He said they had only bought a couple of buns.

A woman surnamed Zhou and her friend took the 8am ferry to Cheung Chau from Central to experience the bun festival.

The pair came from Hangzhou to Hong Kong for work more than six months ago.

""We heard that this cultural activity in Cheung Chau is very unique, and it's an intangible cultural heritage. So we want to experience this very local and traditional event in Hong Kong very much.""

Officiating the parade, Undersecretary for Home and Youth Affairs Clarence Leung said the annual bun festival can attract tourists to explore Hong Kong's unique culture. 

""This year's festival coincides with the Golden Week, which allows more tourists to see Cheung Chau during the long holiday and experience the bun festival,"" he said. 

Tourism minister Rosanna Law will officiate the traditional bun-scrambling competition at midnight. 

As of noon, about 12,300 people had travelled to Cheung Chau from Central, according to ferry operator Sun Ferry.

That represents a fall of 10 percent compared to last year, it added.

The company has arranged more than double the number of Cheung Chau-bound ferries, with up to five boats running every hour."

Microsoft to shut down Skype on May 5,2025-05-05 16:07,,2025-05-05 16:15,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1803264-20250505.htm,"Skype will ring for the last time on Monday as owner Microsoft retires the two-decade-old internet calling service that redefined how people connect across borders.

Founded in 2003, Skype's audio and video calls quickly disrupted the landline industry in the early 2000s and made the company a household name boasting hundreds of millions of users at its peak. But the platform has struggled to keep up with easier-to-use and more reliable rivals such as Zoom and Slack in recent years.

The decline was partly because Skype's underlying technology was not suited for the smartphone era.

When the pandemic and work-from-home fuelled the need for online business calls, Microsoft batted for Teams by aggressively integrating it with other Office apps to tap corporate users.

Skype will become the latest in a series of high-flying bets that Microsoft has mishandled, such as the Internet Explorer web browser and its Windows Phone.

Other big tech firms have also struggled with online communication tools, with Google making several attempts through apps including Hangouts and Duo.

Microsoft declined to share the latest user figures for Skype and said there would be no job cuts due to the move. It added that Teams has about 320 million monthly active users.

When Microsoft bought Skype in 2011 for US$8.5 billion after outbidding Google and Facebook – its largest deal at the time – the service had around 150 million monthly users.

By 2020, that number had fallen to roughly 23 million, despite a brief resurgence during the pandemic. (Reuters)"
