Classes resume at schools affected by Tai Po fire,2025-12-01 13:02,,2025-12-01 13:30,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1834062-20251201.htm,"Several schools in Tai Po that were affected by the Wang Fuk Court inferno resumed classes on Monday, with some switching to online teaching.

One of these is Fung Leung Kit Memorial Secondary School, which is near the residential estate and had been used as a temporary shelter for displaced residents. 

Its principal, Wong Wai-shan, said students were generally all right, adding that the school had reached out to students by phone immediately after the blaze. 

She said the school would  look to resume face-to-face classes as soon as possible so teachers can better observe the students' situation and continue to offer them support.

""We lent out the campus for a few days so we have to check whether it is in a fit enough condition to allow us to resume face-to-face classes,"" Wong said.

""Another thing is that we have to continue to take care of the emotional needs of students and teachers – that's what we have been doing.""

Tai Po District Association of Secondary School Heads chairman Kwok Wing-keung said on an RTHK programme that schools had been monitoring the students' well-being, such as encouraging them to write about their experiences and feelings.

""The first thing we did was to conduct some simple screening, which were done by teachers. If there are more serious cases, we then have to get experts involved,"" Kwok said.

""Special counselling teams within schools, for example, have more experience and training to help in this regard. There are also social workers in schools who can provide additional support if needed.""

Kwok said assistance in counselling services had been sufficient, with some groups, such as psychologists, being on standby to provide help."

The trio, aged 26 to 65, were sent to Queen Elizabeth Hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation, after a fire broke out at their flat's kitchen in Tsz Wan Shan. 

Authorities said the incident at the Tsz Oi Court home happened at around 5am, forcing some 200 residents to evacuate. 

The fire was put out within 20 minutes. 

Initial investigations found the fire had been caused by an electrical short circuit in a kettle. 

Around an hour later, about 100 other people were evacuated from Tuen Mun's Elegance Gardens as thick smoke billowed out from a flat.

It's believed that a short circuit in a thermo pot was to blame."

There were more than 1,900 applications for the emergency subsidy as of Sunday, according to undersecretary for home and youth affairs Clarence Leung, who said the cash had been handed out to some 1,760 households.

""Our goal is to help residents who had to evacuate when the fire broke out and whose lives have been greatly affected,"" Leung told an RTHK programme.

""As tenants are residents there, they are eligible to apply [for the subsidies]. In the event of duplicate applications, we will follow up on each one individually.""

In addition to the emergency subsidy, the government will begin giving out HK$50,000 as a living allowance. 

Family members of each deceased victim will get an additional HK$200,000 as a token of solidarity, along with HK$50,000 for funeral and related expenses.

On temporary housing arrangements, Leung said around 2,100 affected residents have moved into youth hostels, hotels and transitional homes for the time being.

In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index gained 86 points, or 0.34 percent, to open at 25,945.

Across the border, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.14 percent at 3,894, while the Shenzhen Component Index was 0.42 percent up at 13,038. 

The ChiNext Index, which tracks China's Nasdaq-style board of growth enterprises, was up 0.26 percent at 3,060.

The spotlight in the currency market has been on the yen, which strengthened to 155 per US dollar as Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda took the stage in Nagoya, with investors parsing his comments for cues on the timing of the next hike.

Ueda said in a speech to business leaders that the central bank would consider the pros and cons of raising interest rates at its next policy meeting in December.

In stocks, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was steady at 703, having gained 23.5 percent so far this year and on course for its best annual gain since 2017. Japan's Nikkei fell 1.3 percent in early trading.

""The risk bulls roll into December feeling positive about directional bias,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.

""As the clouds of worry that cast an ominous shadow over markets through to mid-November gently dissipate, they give way to new emotions – notably the fear of not participating and the risk of underperforming benchmark targets.""

Investor focus this week will be on US economic releases that cover manufacturing and services activity as well as consumer sentiment.

""With the US data void finally being filled and a busy economic calendar ahead, December looks set to be a merry one for volatility hunters,"" said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at StoneX in Brisbane.

He said if the incoming data signal a slowdown without tipping into recession then sentiment will likely stay buoyant while the US dollar weakens, as it typically does at this time of year.

Investors will watch out for comments from US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell later in the day as they look for clues on what the Fed will do later this month.

Dovish comments from policymakers have convinced investors that a rate cut is on the cards. Traders are pricing in an 87 percent chance of a cut later in the month.

Attention will also be on early indications about holiday consumer spending as data from Black Friday and Cyber Monday retail sales events trickle in.

他認為，適當調整寬鬆程度，對於順利實現物價穩定目標至關重要，指出越來越多人認為，關稅政策對企業利潤影響有限，日本經濟前景不確定性似乎正逐漸減少。

植田和男提到，正積極收集企業對加薪態度的信息，本財年最低工資按年增長超過5%，極有可能鼓勵更多企業提高工資。他相信，工資增長持續傳導至物價，不單食品價格，商品及服務價格亦溫和上升。

他估計，核心消費者通脹率可能在2026財年上半年暫時放緩至2%以下，然後重新加快上升，需要注意有關物價走勢可能通過改變通脹預期來影響基礎通脹。"

柯創盛在本台節目《千禧年代》表示，具體延遲償還的時間和額度方面，要視乎個別單位的供款或按揭，不同單位有不同財務安排，個別業主可主動聯絡財務機構或銀行了解，相信有關機構一定會遵辦。如果業主遇到問題，亦可聯絡房屋署，相信有關安排讓街坊在面對財政壓力上，不用太過擔心。

至於透過白表或自由市場購買單位的業主，柯創盛相信，政府會一籃子去看待，面對如此大災難會想盡辦法協助。

被問到有關安排會否影響房委會財政狀況，他認為居屋等同私人物業，業主與財務機構或銀行的協定，應該不會影響房委會的財政安排。至於如果按揭人離世後的安排，柯創盛表示，如果業主離世，可按法律程序善後，要視乎個別單位遇到的困難去處理。

文章說，日本首相高市早苗近日在國會出席辯論時說，日本根據「舊金山和約」放棄了全部權利，並無認定台灣法律地位的立場，這種刻意歪曲歷史的所謂「台灣地位未定」論調，與她早前公然宣稱「台灣有事」可能構成日本「存亡危機事態」的錯誤言行可謂如出一轍，再一次暴露了她突破戰後國際秩序、為日本軍事介入台海預製鋪墊的真實意圖。

文章又說，高市早苗選擇性無視構成戰後國際秩序基石的一系列法律文件，唯獨援引「舊金山和約」這份非法無效的文件，不僅是對歷史的無知和曲解，更是對國際社會公認準則的踐踏。"

台灣明年新措施加強司機安全駕駛能力　學者稱應收緊考試制度,2025-12-01 09:13,,2025-12-01 09:30,greater_china,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1834040-20251201.htm,"台灣明年將分階段實施17項駕駛執照制度改革措施，針對以人為本，透過違規駕駛要強制性上矯正課程、高齡分級更換車牌等，加強司機的安全駕駛能力。

去年由桃園市民自發組成的民間組織「桃園市人本交通推動協會」，過去積極推動道路安全。理事王晨恩表示，台灣的交通問題曾經被外國媒體形容是「行人地獄」，連居民平日出入也會擔心安全。過去一、兩年看到顯著改變，政府不斷加設行人路及馬路中央的安全島等，馬路的防撞桿也越來越多。她說司機的駕駛態度有改變，越來越多司機會有停車讓行人的意識。

王晨恩支持駕駛執照改革的大方向，但認為許多交通問題仍未納入管理，例如路試很多都是人流稀少的馬路，路況太過簡單，不切合實際情況，建議應該加入商業區及醫院等人流較多的路線。

台灣的電單車特別多，形成一種文化。陽明交通大學運輸與物流管理學系教授邱裕鈞指出，台灣18至24歲剛獲取電單車牌照的人是非常危險的群組，發生意外機率亦最高。他說在台灣考私家車車牌的人，大多會在事前上駕駛班，但考電單車牌人士卻大多數沒有上駕駛班習慣，他們會直接在路上練習便去考試，考試亦很容易便通過，他認為應該收緊考牌制度。

邱裕鈞又認為，要減少交通意外，除了針對司機，亦應該向同是道路使用者的行人執法。他說以往較少對違例行人執法，例如衝紅燈、不用行人線過馬路等，他特別提到行人喜愛低頭看手機的現象，影響司機安全駕駛，應考慮禁止。"

In a statement, the bureau said the registered contractor of the project has been asked to remove the plastic sheeting immediately, and it's seeking legal advice on whether to prosecute.

The bureau's Independent Checking Unit had ordered the work to be suspended ""for the sake of prudence"", and the contractor has been asked to conduct an independent safety audit to review their safety management system.

Only after an improvement plan is submitted and improvement measures are taken would authorities consider allowing works to resume, the Housing Bureau said.

Similar measures have been taken at two other buildings in North Point and Central where windows were earlier found to also be covered by plastic sheeting.

Authorities have pointed to the extensive use of highly flammable polystyrene foam boards to cover windows at Wang Fuk Court as having contributed to the rapid spread of the fire at the Tai Po estate.

The Buildings Department has said the deadly blaze had exposed ""serious deficiencies"" in site safety management on the part of the registered contractor of the works at Wang Fuk Court – Prestige Construction & Engineering Company (PC&E).

It had earlier suspended works on 28 projects managed by PC&E over concerns about its ability to ensure site safety.

The deadly fire – which has claimed at least 146 lives – had prompted territory-wide inspections of buildings undergoing external wall maintenance.

As of Sunday, 319 such buildings have been inspected, and for those that use scaffold nets, samples have been taken for testing.

No other buildings were found to have used foam boards or plastic sheeting to block windows.

In a related operation, the Labour Department has inspected 51 construction sites to check fire protection measures and emergency preparedness at buildings undergoing maintenance work.

As of Sunday, the department has inspected 51 construction sites, issued a total of 45 written warnings and 12 improvement notices, and has taken out two prosecutions."

Both the government and the private sector have been pitching in to offer various kinds of assistance to victims of the tragedy, from emergency cash, to temporary housing and the provision of everyday items.

The government said it has registered more than 1,900 households for an emergency cash subsidy of HK$10,000 per affected household to provide immediate relief. As of 1pm on Sunday, subsidies had been handed out to 1,420 households.

Family members of each deceased victim will get an additional HK$200,000 as a token of solidarity, along with HK$50,000 for funeral and related expenses. Fees for columbarium and related services will be waived.

Separately, affected households will be given a living allowance of HK$50,000 starting this week.

Social workers of the Social Welfare Department have been in contact with about 1,300 affected households, and 3,200 affected residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" support service.

Those who have yet to get in touch with their dedicated social worker have been urged to call 182 183 as soon as possible.

Members of the public have also been coming forward with donations of everyday essentials for the residents of Wang Fuk Court.

The government has set up a central supplies station at the Tai Po Community Centre to coordinate and manage the donated materials.

It's also set up a new online donation platform www.taipodonation.hk to register donations and enable officials to better consolidate information and distribute supplies to residents in need as necessary.

Many affected residents have been set up in temporary housing – 1,144 people have moved into transitional flats provided by the Housing Bureau or the Housing Society, while 683 others are staying at youth hostels, camps or hotel rooms as of Monday morning.

People still looking for accommodations can call the Task force on Transitional Housing at 3611-8482 for more information about the free housing. Pets, officials say, are also welcome.

內塔尼亞胡目前因貪腐案受審。總統府的聲明指內塔尼亞胡的律師已將赦免請求提交至總統府法律部門，赫爾佐格收到相關意見後會以負責任的態度審議有關請求。

新華社引述以色列時報報道，以色列總統有權赦免經法院定罪的人，在極少數情況下，如果符合公共利益，相關人員甚至可以在法律程序結束前獲得赦免，但必須由尋求赦免的當事人或其直系親屬提出申請。　

2020年初，以色列檢方以3項指控，包括受賄、欺詐及違背公眾信任，正式起訴內塔尼亞胡。同年5月，法院首次開庭審理該案，內塔尼亞胡成為以色列首名接受司法審理的在任總理。

在案件中，內塔尼亞胡及家人涉嫌在2007年至2016年間，從以色列商人、荷李活製片人米勒漢，收受總值約28萬美元的物品，而作為回報，內塔尼亞胡直接或間接向對方提供好處。

如果罪名成立，內塔尼亞胡因受賄面臨的最高刑罰將會是10年監禁，因欺詐與違背公眾信任將合共面臨3年監禁的最高刑罰。案件自2020年審理啟動以來，內塔尼亞胡多次以戰事、外訪、健康等理由拖延避審。"

The force said they cannot rule out whether or not there will be more fatalities as more than 40 people are still unaccounted for. A total of 79 people have been injured, while 54 bodies still need to be identified. 

Officers searched Wang Kin House, Wang Tai House and Wang Shing House on Sunday. They have completed the search at four of the seven affected blocks.

They said many of the newly-found bodies were located in Wang Tai House, which they said was one of the blocks that caught fire early and had less time for evacuation.

Police New Territories North regional commander Lam Man-han said it may take them weeks to finalise the search for the three remaining blocks.

""Those remaining are the difficult ones. I have to be very prudent and I wouldn't shorten our estimate time for the time being, it's still three to four weeks,"" she told reporters at a briefing.

The commander said while Wang Chi House did not catch fire, the conditions around the block remain too dangerous for residents to return to collect their belongings.

She said there could be falling debris, and officers will work to clear dangerous items as soon as possible.

Police also said they have confirmed that 159 people that had been reported missing are safe.

The force decided to classify 100 reports of missing persons as impossible to process, after they went through the cases with those who filed the reports.

They said that is because there is not enough information to confirm the people concerned actually live in Wang Fuk Court, or there is not enough information to follow up on the cases.

The Housing Department, meanwhile, said initial inspections of all eight of the Wang Fuk Court buildings show that they are structurally safe. 

But it noted some individual units had been seriously damaged and need emergency repairs before officers can enter them."

吳江浩表示，恪守一個中國原則，是日本必須嚴格履行的政治承諾和不容推卸的國際法義務。

吳江浩指出，中日關係的穩定發展，只能建立在牢固的政治基礎之上。日本現職領導人單方面發起的破壞性行為，誤判形勢、悖逆潮流、撞上南牆。日方當前唯一正確做法，就是恪守數十年來反復作出的政治承諾，停止破壞戰後國際秩序，立即撤回錯誤荒謬言論，以實際行動徹底認錯糾錯。"
