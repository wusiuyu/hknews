"Hong Kong's single-family offices total surpasses 3 380, injecting over $10 billion annually into local economy",2026-02-10 13:30,2026-02-10 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000234.htm,"  The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) jointly announced today (February 10) that over 3 380 single-family offices were in operation in Hong Kong as of the end of 2025, according to the Market Study on the Family Office Landscape in Hong Kongcommissioned by InvestHK and conducted by Deloitte. This represents an increase of about 680 offices over the past two years, equivalent to a growth of more than 25 per cent.

  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said, ""Hong Kong is a leading global asset and wealth management hub, with sustained and robust development in its family office ecosystem. The continued growth in the number of family offices in Hong Kong reflects the tangible outcomes of the Government's efforts in policy formulation and institutional development. Amidst global changes, the family office industry and asset management sector are undergoing a rapid evolution, placing greater emphasis on sustainable growth, intergenerational legacy, and positive impact. Under the 'one country, two systems' framework, Hong Kong, with its advantages of being backed by the motherland and connected to the world, provides a favourable environment which is both predictable and has high potential for family offices to grow. The Government will continue to pursue the development of the family office sector through multipronged measures, including enhancing tax arrangements, implementing the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme, conducting global investment promotion activities by the dedicated FamilyOfficeHK team of InvestHK, establishing the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy, etc.""

  He added, ""In particular, we plan to introduce legislative proposals in the first half of this year to expand the scope of qualifying investment for the preferential tax regimes offered to funds and single-family offices, covering, for example, precious metals, loans and private credit investments, and digital assets. With various policy measures in place, we are confident of achieving the new target set out in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address to assist more than 220 family offices to establish or expand their business in Hong Kong from 2026 to 2028.""

  The Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK, Ms Alpha Lau, said, ""When our dedicated family office team conducted promotional activities in Europe and Southeast Asia, we learned that many overseas family offices had a strong interest in Hong Kong's institutional advantages and tax incentives. Hong Kong offers a highly flexible investment environment, with a preferential tax regime that imposes no restrictions on the geographical location of investments, and facilitates family offices to invest in global assets through Hong Kong. In addition, single-family offices are not required to obtain a licence in Hong Kong in general, which helps maintain a high level of privacy. These are key considerations that overseas family offices particularly value.""

  Family offices contribute to the local economy in various ways, such as making diversified financial investments, managing their operations, pursuing philanthropic endeavours, etc. The study estimates that single-family offices operating in Hong Kong contribute approximately $12.6 billion annually to the local economy through operating expenditures alone, and that they directly employ over 10 000 full-time professionals within their operations. Taking account of multifamily offices and other service providers supporting family offices, the actual economic benefits are expected to be even more substantial.

  The study also highlights Hong Kong's pivotal role in asset and wealth management in Asia, with assets under management of approximately $35 trillion (about US$4.5 trillion) as of end-2024. In addition, Hong Kong ranked second in the number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals as of June 2025, being one of the top destinations for setting up family offices. The Government will continue to work closely with the industry to introduce more supporting measures, with a view to developing a robust family office ecosystem."
香港單一家辦數量逾3 380間　為本港經濟帶來每年過百億港元收益,2026-02-10 13:30,2026-02-10 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000233.htm,"財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）與投資推廣署今日（二月十日）聯合宣布，根據投資推廣署委託德勤進行的《香港家族辦公室市場研究》顯示，截至二○二五年年底，香港的單一家族辦公室（家辦）數目已超過 3 380 間，兩年間增加約680間，升幅超過25%。

財庫局局長許正宇表示：「香港是全球資產及財富管理的領先樞紐，家辦行業生態圈持續蓬勃發展。香港家辦的數目持續增長，反映政府在政策推動和制度建設上的努力已取得實質成果。因應全球變局，家辦行業和資產管理正加速演變，更着重可持續增長、跨代傳承和發揮正向的社會影響力。在『一國兩制』下，香港憑藉背靠祖國、連接全球的優勢，為家辦帶來兼具可預測性和高增長潛力的優良發展環境。政府將持續透過多管齊下的措施推動家辦業界的發展，包括優化稅務安排、推行『新資本投資者入境計劃』、透過投資推廣署家辦專責團隊在全球各地舉辦投資推廣活動、設立香港財富傳承學院等。」

他補充說：「我們已計劃於今年上半年提交立法建議，擴展有關基金及單一家辦的優惠稅制合資格投資範圍，涵蓋例如貴金屬、貸款及私募債權投資和數字資產。在各項政策措施支持下，我們有信心達到《行政長官2025年施政報告》所訂下、在二○二六年至二○二八年年底前協助逾220間家辦來港落戶或擴展業務的新目標。」

投資推廣署署長劉凱旋表示：「我們家辦專責團隊過去在歐洲及東南亞等地進行推廣時，了解到不少海外家辦對香港的制度優勢及稅務優惠有濃厚興趣。香港提供高度靈活的投資環境，稅務優惠制度對投資地點並不設限，家辦可透過香港投資全球資產。同時，單一家辦在港一般無需申請牌照，有助於維持高度的私隱性，這些都是海外家辦尤其重視的關鍵考量。」

家辦透過參與多元化的財務投資活動、營運管理、從事慈善事業等不同渠道，為本地經濟帶來實質貢獻。調研估算，香港的單一家辦單在本地直接聘用逾10 000名全職專業人員，而這些單一家辦單是營運開支，就為本港經濟帶來每年約126億港元的收益。若計及聯合家辦及其他為家辦提供服務的機構，預計實際帶來的經濟效益更為可觀。

是次調研同時突顯香港在亞洲資產及財富管理領域的核心角色，其資產管理規模於二○二四年年底約為 35萬億港元（約 4.5萬億美元）。此外，截至二○二五年六月，香港擁有全球第二多的超高淨值人士，是設立家辦的首選地點之一。政府將繼續與業界保持緊密合作，推動更多配套措施，構建完善的家辦生態圈。"
Remarks by CE at media session before ExCo (with video),2026-02-10 13:25,2026-02-10 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000367.htm,"  Following are the remarks by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at a media session before the Executive Council meeting today (February 10):

Reporter: Good morning, Mr Chief Executive, two questions. The first question is, after Jimmy Lai's sentencing, you described him as having committed numerous heinous crimes and his evil deeds were beyond measure for the 20-year imprisonment. Do you think the sentence reflects his culpability? Will the authorities appeal the sentence to the Judiciary? What are your views on the perspectives of European and American countries regarding the case? And the second question is, the Government has issued a questionnaire to Wang Fuk Court residents on the rehousing scheme for more than a month. Would you commit to having a more optimised scheme before Lunar New Year so that residents can celebrate the New Year with peace of mind? And additionally, the Government's proposed scheme may involve the use of public funds. Will you instruct the Financial Secretary to reserve funding for Wang Fuk Court rehousing in the Budget to be announced at the end of this month? Thank you.

Chief Executive: Jimmy Lai, who has betrayed the country and Hong Kong, has been sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment, a heavy punishment that sends a solemn warning against malicious plots of collusion with external elements and endangering national security. Lai has committed numerous heinous crimes, and his evil deeds were beyond measure. The heavy sentence of 20 years imposed on him manifests that the rule of law is upheld and justice is done. Lai had long used Apple Daily to poison the minds of the people of Hong Kong by inciting hatred, distorting facts, deliberately stirring up social antagonism and glorifying violence. He has openly begged for external forces to impose sanctions against China and the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region), sacrificing the well-being of the people of China and Hong Kong. He caused damage to the interests of the country and the Hong Kong SAR. His conviction is supported by overwhelming evidence, and he deserves the punishment after all the harm that he has done.

The court pointed out clearly in its verdict handed down earlier that Lai was the mastermind of the case. He had manipulated and exploited Apple Daily to poison society and colluded with external forces to beg for sanctions and hostile activities against China and the Hong Kong SAR. Lai's malicious plot spanned across both the periods before and after the promulgation of the Hong Kong National Security Law. His intent was to collude with external forces to harm the interests of China and the Hong Kong SAR, as well as those of the people. He has shamelessly acted as a pawn of external forces to endanger national security.

The court has already handed down heavy sentences for Lai and the other defendants in accordance with the law, manifesting that the rule of law is upheld and justice is done. That said, Hong Kong as a whole has already paid a heavy price. Poisoned by Lai and Apple Daily under his control, some of our citizens, especially young people, have been misled to break the law and become radical and violent. During the period of ""black violence"", they committed acts of vandalism on public facilities. Not only did they storm the buildings of the Hong Kong SAR Government, the Legislative Council and offices of the Central Government in Hong Kong, they also threw petrol bombs, committed arson and even set people on fire. Furthermore, some young people smuggled real guns, made bombs and made plans for terrorist activities. It was fortunate that the Police promptly cracked down on these plots and prevented mass casualties. However, many young people who had been incited to commit crimes eventually ended up in prison. As of the end of last year, more than 2 400 individuals have to face legal consequences for unlawful acts during the period of ""black violence"". It is plain to see that the evil deeds committed by Lai and his syndicate were beyond measure.

The Hong Kong SAR Government has completed the local legislation on Article 23 of the Basic Law and enacted the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance. The Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance are complementary to each other to establish the legal protection for safeguarding national security. They also protect the legitimate rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR will do all its best to prevent, suppress and punish acts and activities that endanger national security, fulfilling its responsibility of the most righteousness.

Since we took action against a lot of syndicates who were involved in crimes related to endangering national security, western countries and also politicians and organisations have been bad-mouthing Hong Kong's righteous action to protect national security. They are doing this, of course, for their political agenda. A lot try to cause trouble in Hong Kong so as to cause trouble to our country, China. Thanks to the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, we now have the tools to take action against all these illegal activities and acts. We will resolutely fulfil our duty to safeguard national security, despite all the political attempts that try to smear our righteous action of safeguarding national security. They all do this for obvious reasons. Some of the people we are taking action against are their pawns, are their representatives, and are under their influence to endanger Hong Kong's and our country's national security. It will be against their interests that we successfully neutralise their attempts. These attacks, I expect, will continue, because this is something they will not stop in order to ensure that their own national security interests override others'. Certainly, I will not allow that to happen.

Regarding sentence, the DoJ (Department of Justice) and the Police will study in detail the judgment and the reasons and consider it fully.

Regarding Wang Fuk Court, I attach great interest and importance to the long-term accommodation arrangements for residents of Wang Fuk Court, and the Government has been continuing to provide suitable assistance to the affected families. For the issues that the Government has to resolve are really complicated, because each household has its own circumstances and needs, and there are also very diverse opinions in society. The Government carefully considers and deals with the various views and takes into account some very practical issues, such as the appropriate use of public resources, the allocation of public funds, the distribution of housing resources, and the relevant legal ownership-related responsibilities and challenges.

The Government also needs to properly manage the transitional arrangements of accommodation. Timely action is crucial. The sooner we can make available the options for residents to choose, the better. The Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements, led by the Deputy Financial Secretary, has been working incessantly to develop a concrete plan in the following directions. First, to consider the wishes of the affected families while ensuring the efficient use of resources and balancing empathy, reason and law. Second, to provide multiple options to affected families, including Home Ownership Scheme and Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme flats, as well as Hong Kong Housing Society units. And also third, to offer accommodation arrangements, either within Tai Po or across different districts.

Through the ""one social worker per household"" service, the task force collected preliminary preferences from affected flat owners. Currently, responses from them have largely been received. The task force is working intensively to compile and analyse flat owners' preferences regarding different options. Initial observations indicate that the vast majority of owners hope the Government will expedite the handling of long-term rehousing work. A significant proportion of flat owners have expressed willingness to consider the Government's acquisition of their ownership rights. Some flat owners have indicated that they need to look at the actual acquisition price.

The task force is currently working hard to overcome some of the following issues, which pose difficulties and challenges. First, how to handle the differing needs of various families in a consistent manner. Second, issues regarding liability, compensation uncertainty and relevant legal matters concerning the public insurance of Wang Fuk Court. Third, whether ownership-related responsibility and legal disputes will pose risks of prolonged delays in resolution. I have instructed the task force to promptly study the feasibility of various options and the legal issues, seek advice from the Department of Justice and propose arrangements as soon as possible.

I understand this is no easy time for families of Wang Fuk Court. The Government will work tirelessly to finalise the plan as soon as possible, enable affected families to make the most suitable choices, and assist them in rebuilding their homes and resuming their normal lives as quickly as possible.

Regarding our arrangements, of course, we may have to use some public funding. The Government will prudently make assessments and make appropriate arrangements to ensure that public funds are used effectively, striking a balance between the needs of the residents and the reasonable use of public resources. Thank you.

​行政長官於行政會議前會見傳媒開場發言及答問內容（附短片）,2026-02-10 13:25,2026-02-10 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000366.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（二月十日）上午出席行政會議前會見傳媒的開場發言及答問內容：

行政長官：大家早晨！今日早上，國務院新聞辦公室發布了《「一國兩制」下香港維護國家安全的實踐》白皮書（《白皮書》），意義重大，正合其時，我對此表示十分歡迎和全力支持。特區政府會全力支持和履行《白皮書》的內容和要求。作為特區首長和當家人，我會領導和統籌特區行政、立法、司法機關貫徹履行維護國家安全的責任。

中央政府從醞釀提出「一國兩制」科學構想到全面實施「一國兩制」方針，始終堅定維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，保持香港長期繁榮穩定。《白皮書》從五個方面系統闡述了香港維護國家安全方面的鬥爭從未停止，包括中央政府對香港有關的國家安全事務負有根本責任，香港特區切實履行維護國家安全的憲制責任，香港實現由亂到治走向由治及興，並闡明中央對香港特區以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展必須把握的實踐要求。

首先，《白皮書》詳細闡明了香港維護國家安全的鬥爭從未停止。回歸後二十多年，香港維護國家安全的鬥爭長期聚焦《基本法》第二十三條本地立法，《基本法》第二十三條立法長期無法完成，給敵對勢力有機可乘。修例風波最終演變成港版「顏色革命」，「黑暴」肆虐，嚴重挑戰「一國兩制」原則底線，嚴重損害香港憲制秩序和法治，嚴重危害國家主權、安全、發展利益，也愈加凸顯香港特區在維護國家安全方面存在的法律漏洞和機制短板。

第二，《白皮書》闡明中央政府對香港有關的國家安全事務負有根本責任。《白皮書》指出，維護國家安全是中央事權，中央立法維護國家安全是國際慣例，各國皆然。在香港難以自行完成有關立法、面對嚴峻暴力和破壞、國家安全迫在眉睫的情況之下，中央行使憲制權力，制定實施《香港國安法》，採取完善香港選舉制度等一系列標本兼治的舉措，有效維護了國家安全，有力維護了香港特區憲制秩序，沉重打擊了反中亂港勢力，對香港迅速止暴制亂、實現由亂到治的歷史性轉折發揮了決定性作用，在「一國兩制」實踐進程中具有重要的里程碑意義。

第三，《白皮書》闡明香港特區切實履行維護國家安全的憲制責任。《白皮書》指出，《香港國安法》公布實施以來，香港特區行政長官和政府敢於擔當、善作善成，行政、立法、司法機關各司其職，積極防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，進一步築牢香港維護國家安全的屏障。《白皮書》指出，香港特區歷史性完成《基本法》第二十三條立法，履行了長期未完成的憲制責任；香港特區執法、檢控、司法部門無畏無懼、恪盡職守，依法打擊危害國家安全罪行；香港特區政府持續加強宣傳教育，不斷增強香港居民國家安全意識。

第四，《白皮書》闡明香港實現由亂到治走向由治及興。《白皮書》指出，經過中央政府和香港特區的共同努力，香港維護國家安全工作取得歷史性成就、發生歷史性變革：香港的政權安全得到有效維護，治理效能顯著提升；法治尊嚴得到有力捍衛，社會秩序恢復穩定；香港營商環境持續優化，為市場注入了強大的穩定性、確定性和可預期性；香港市民依法享有各項權利和自由有了更好保障，福祉日益增進。

第五，《白皮書》闡明以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展必須把握的實踐要求。《白皮書》指出，新時代新征程，必須以總體國家安全觀為指導，牢牢把握「一國兩制」下維護國家安全的實踐要求，堅定不移建設高水平安全，護航「一國兩制」實踐行穩致遠，包括堅持中央的根本責任和特區的憲制責任相統一；堅持把特區管治權牢牢掌握在愛國者手中；堅持尊重和保障人權；堅持在法治軌道上維護安全；堅持統籌發展與安全；堅持在開放中維護安全。

《「一國兩制」下香港維護國家安全的實踐》白皮書對香港特區至為重要，具有指導性和關鍵現實意義，我們必須認真學習和領會當中的精神要義和指示。《白皮書》帶給我三點重要領會：第一，香港維護國家安全的鬥爭從未停止，國家安全的風險依然存在，我們必須時刻警惕。第二，維護國家安全是中央事權，我們支持並感謝中央從國家層面制定《香港國安法》；香港特區要認真和切實履行維護國家安全的憲制責任。第三，我們要以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展，實踐《白皮書》的要求。

《白皮書》提醒我們必須對國安風險時刻警惕，《白皮書》的發布，更是對出賣國家和香港特區的叛徒作出最嚴正的警告。背叛國家和香港特區的黎智英，昨日被法庭重判入獄20年，刑期對勾結外部勢力危害國家安全的歹毒圖謀發出了嚴厲警告。

黎智英罪行滔天，惡貫滿盈，被重判入獄20年，彰顯法治，伸張正義。黎智英長期利用《蘋果日報》荼毒市民，煽動仇恨、歪曲事實、蓄意製造社會對立、美化暴力，公然乞求外部勢力制裁中國、制裁香港特區，犧牲人民福祉，賣國禍港，損害國家和香港特區利益，罪證纍纍，罪有應得。

法庭早前頒下的裁決清楚指出黎智英為案中主腦，控制和利用《蘋果日報》荼毒社會，勾結外國勢力，乞求對中國和香港特區實施制裁和採取敵對行動。黎智英的歹毒圖謀跨越《香港國安法》實施前後，目的是勾結外部勢力，損害中國和香港特區的利益，損害市民的利益，無恥地充當外部勢力的爪牙，危害國家安全。

法庭依法對黎智英及各被告作出重判，彰顯了法治和公義，然而香港社會已承受了沉重的代價：在黎智英和他所操控的《蘋果日報》的荼毒下，部分市民，尤其是青年人，被誤導而違反法律，變得激進暴戾，於「黑暴」期間大肆破壞公共設施、衝擊政府大樓、立法會和中央駐港機構、投擲汽油彈、大肆縱火，更放火燒人，更有年輕人偷運真槍、製造炸彈、策劃恐怖活動，幸得警方及早搗破，才避免了大量人命傷亡。這些被煽動的人，包括年輕人，很多因犯法而入獄。截至去年底，有2 400多人因「黑暴」期間所犯的各種罪行，承擔法律後果，可見黎智英團夥及《蘋果日報》的惡貫滿盈。

香港特區政府已就《基本法》第二十三條完成本地立法，制定了《維護國家安全條例》。《香港國安法》與《維護國家安全條例》渾然一體，築起維護國家安全的法律屏障。特區會堅定不移維護國家安全，保障香港市民的合法權益，全力防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，履行天經地義的維護國家安全責任。多謝大家。

記者：政府應急住宿安排工作組已就宏福苑長遠安置方案，收集了九成居民意見，預計是否能夠在農曆年前公布結果？目前較為傾向哪些方案？政府會否考慮使用公帑購買業權？如何平衡使用公帑的公平性？其次，長和旗下巴拿馬港口公司手上的合同，被巴拿馬最高法院判令違憲，中央政府和特區政府都發表聲明表示不滿，但巴拿馬當局還沒有反應，特區政府有甚麼看法？會否考慮約見更多本港商界，呼籲他們謹慎投資？

行政長官：政府十分重視大埔宏福苑居民的長遠住宿安排，持續為受影響的家庭提供適切協助。長遠住宿安排所涉及的問題是複雜的，每戶都有個別情況和需要，而社會上亦意見紛紜。政府會小心處理，平衡各方面意見。政府亦要兼顧一些現實的問題，例如公共資源的適當運用、公帑的投入、住屋資源的分配、相關的法律、業權等責任和問題，政府亦要妥善做好過渡性安排。當然時間上要盡快做，愈早讓受影響的家庭可以作出決定是好的。

財政司副司長領導的應急住宿安排工作組一直從以下幾個方向，盡快制訂具體方案。第一，既考慮受影響家庭的意願，亦要兼顧善用資源，要情、理、法兼備；第二，提供多元選項，包括居屋、綠置居以及房協單位，讓居民「有得揀」；第三，因應居民意願，提供大埔原區或跨區的居住安排。工作組透過「一戶一社工」的問卷，收集了受影響業主的初步意願，目前業主的回覆已經大致收齊，工作組正密鑼緊鼓歸納和分析業主就不同選項的意願。初步觀察，有絕大部分業主期望政府從速處理長遠住宿安排，有相當高比例的業主表示會考慮接受政府向他們收購業權，亦有業主表示要考慮實質的收購價。

現時工作組歸納了以下要克服的問題和挑戰，第一，就不同家庭的需求分歧，如何可以一致性處理；第二，對宏福苑的公共保險所涉及的責任，賠償不確定性和相關的法律問題；第三，所涉的業權責任和法律爭拗，會否帶來長時間延誤解決的風險等。我已經指示工作組必須盡快研究各方面的可行方案，以及所涉及的法律問題，以徵詢律政司意見，盡早落實安排。

我明白這段時期對每一位宏福苑居民來說都是不容易，政府會馬不停蹄，盡早敲定方案，讓受影響居民可以作出最適合的選擇，協助他們早日重建家園、早日重回安定生活。

就巴拿馬最高法院所指，巴拿馬港口公司和巴拿馬政府簽署續約經營兩個巴拿馬港口違憲，特區政府表示強烈不滿。特區政府的態度是清晰的，反對任何外國政府在國際經貿關係中，使用脅逼、施壓或其他不合理的政治手段。商務及經濟發展局已在上星期召見了巴拿馬駐港總領事，表達對裁決的強烈不滿，認為巴拿馬對合法經貿關係的出爾反爾，破壞了巴拿馬的信用，將對當地的營商環境和經濟發展造成深遠損害，並嚴重破壞國際貿易規則。特區政府敦促巴拿馬政府尊重合約精神，為當地依法營運的企業提供公平、公正的營商環境，確保企業的合法權益不受干預，而香港企業在巴拿馬經營和投資，應獲得公平、合理的待遇和保障。外交部亦已清晰表明，中方將採取一切必要措施，堅決維護中方企業正當合法權益，特區政府會全面支持和配合國家所採取的措施。

我相信今次事件已損害投資者對巴拿馬當地營商環境的信心，會審視現在和未來在當地的投資，希望巴拿馬當局認真保障合約精神、認真保障企業的合法利益。多謝。

記者：「十五五」規劃綱要預計將在即將召開的全國兩會上正式發布。特區政府此前也多次強調會主動對接「十五五」規劃，請問您香港將如何主動跟進「十五五」規劃？有沒有具體的時間表？以及春節假期是內地居民出境旅遊的高峰期，而香港是熱門的旅行目的地，請問您特區政府為迎接即將到來的內地春節旅客安排了甚麼活動？作出了哪些安排？在推動文體旅協同發展和盛事經濟的背景下，今年香港將推出哪些重點盛事，以吸引更多旅客訪港？謝謝。

行政長官：今年是國家「十五五」規劃的開局之年，我們會全面、主動、積極對接國家「十五五」規劃，為香港開創新局，提升競爭力，進一步發展經濟、改善民生，把握重大機遇。

我會從三個範疇跟大家說一說我的看法。第一，為何要對接？國家的五年規劃作為治國理政的顯著制度優勢，已被國際社會廣泛認同。國家正通過「十五五」規劃繼續推動發展新質生產力，推動高質量發展及優化提升傳統產業，同時培育壯大新型產業和未來產業，推動科技創新和產業創新深度融合。

香港當下面對經濟轉型期，勞動力技能需求變化，國際競爭加劇，地緣風險上升等挑戰。融入國家發展大局可帶來新空間、新動能。香港如能與國家中長期規劃同頻共振，發揮香港背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢和重要作用，就能在各領域開拓新的發展機遇，進一步發展經濟，改善民生。

第二，要對接甚麼？我們會從五個重點方面對接，第一，鞏固提升香港國際金融中心，與國家建設金融強國戰略對接。第二，鞏固提升香港國際航運中心，對接國家建設交通強國戰略，深化與粵港澳大灣區港口群協同合作。第三，鞏固提升香港貿易中心，對接國家建設強大國內市場和貿易強國戰略，發揮好「引進來、走出去」的角色。第四，建設香港國際創新科技中心，與國家加快高水平科技自立自強戰略對接。第五，香港打造國際高端人才集聚高地，對接國家教育強國、科技強國、人才強國的戰略部署。當然，這些都是我點出來的例子而已，還有其他領域。

第三，是香港如何對接？香港特區將制定五年發展規劃，構建系統性的政策框架，對重點發展領域作出更精準、細緻的戰略部署。我將親自領導跨部門、全政府的專責小組進行統籌、協調。各政策組正成立準備小組，待三月「十五五」規劃綱要正式公布後，準備小組會轉為對接「十五五」規劃工作組，進行政策對接的編制工作，並全速推進。

我將推進相關體制機制建設，以下是其中五個例子：第一，堅持和完善行政主導，推進治理改革，提升行政效能，更好接合有為政府與高效市場，推動特區實現良政善治。第二，保持國際性的營商環境，確保外資企業和國際機構能在香港享有透明、公正的制度環境。第三，深化內地和香港經貿合作機制，進一步深化《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》（CEPA），善用經貿合作機制；第四，加快發展北部都會區，北部都會區不僅拓展香港經濟發展空間，更成為融入粵港澳大灣區、服務國家雙循環新格局的關鍵橋頭堡，為構建國際創新科技中心提供堅實支撐；第五，深化粵港澳大灣區協同發展，特區政府將深化大灣區區域合作，強化協同效應，推動區域融合與高效互聯互通。這是有關「十五五」的部署。

有關你問及新春的活動，下星期二、二月十七日就是馬年的大年初一，我首先在這裏預祝大家福馬臨門、馬到功成。今年內地的春節黃金周長達九天，由年二十八到年初七，將會帶來內地旅客訪港的高峰期。我們將延續旅遊業增長勢頭，舉辦多姿多采的新春節慶活動。首先，明天二月十一日是年二十四，全港的14個農曆新年年宵市場會開幕，直到年初一的清晨；後天起、二月十二日，年二十五，春節綵燈展會在尖沙咀文化中心露天廣場舉行超過一個月；年初一晚上，尖沙咀有新春國際匯演之夜，主題是「開年開運開心」，有近60支來自許多個國家和地區的隊伍來香港獻技；之後在年初二至正月十五，花車將在本港多個地點展出，包括啟德體育園，多支參與匯演的表演隊伍，也會在不同地點演出；年初二晚上有農曆新年煙花匯演，23分鐘的煙花將閃耀維多利亞港；年初三，沙田馬場舉行馬年賽馬日，應景應節，氣氛必然熱鬧；年初五，香港大球場舉行賀歲盃足球賽，大家都可以一睹自己心目中的一些球星。其間還有大埔林村的「香港許願節」、黃大仙祠和車公廟等活動，預計都會非常熱鬧。

為確保旅客有好的體驗，由政務司司長領導的節慶安排跨部門工作小組上星期已經開會，協調各政府部門機構和業界緊密合作。在口岸服務、公共交通、郊外熱門的景點、旅行團和保障旅行安排等方面，全面做好準備和應對工作。為提供更全面的資訊，香港旅遊發展局也推出一站式的新春節慶專頁，保安局也會通過一站式通關資訊平台「口岸通」，為旅客提供更全面的資訊，方便提早計劃行程。

未來兩個月，香港會繼續馬不停蹄舉行連串國際級的旗艦盛事，例如在正月十七到二十，即三月五日到八日，世界級的哥爾夫球賽事「LIV Golf 2026香港站」會在粉嶺香港哥爾夫球會舉行。三月會是香港的藝術月，其他活動包括香港藝術節、巴塞爾藝術展香港展會、Art Central等，還有潮流文化盛事ComplexCon，都會陸續登場。我們會將春節的歡樂氣氛一直延續到未來幾個月，組織各類活動，為香港帶來更歡樂的氣氛和經濟活動。謝謝大家。

Remarks by CE at media session before ExCo,2026-02-10 13:25,2026-02-10 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000367.htm,"  Following are the remarks by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at a media session before the Executive Council meeting today (February 10):

Reporter: Good morning, Mr Chief Executive, two questions. The first question is, after Jimmy Lai's sentencing, you described him as having committed numerous heinous crimes and his evil deeds were beyond measure for the 20-year imprisonment. Do you think the sentence reflects his culpability? Will the authorities appeal the sentence to the Judiciary? What are your views on the perspectives of European and American countries regarding the case? And the second question is, the Government has issued a questionnaire to Wang Fuk Court residents on the rehousing scheme for more than a month. Would you commit to having a more optimised scheme before Lunar New Year so that residents can celebrate the New Year with peace of mind? And additionally, the Government's proposed scheme may involve the use of public funds. Will you instruct the Financial Secretary to reserve funding for Wang Fuk Court rehousing in the Budget to be announced at the end of this month? Thank you.

Chief Executive: Jimmy Lai, who has betrayed the country and Hong Kong, has been sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment, a heavy punishment that sends a solemn warning against malicious plots of collusion with external elements and endangering national security. Lai has committed numerous heinous crimes, and his evil deeds were beyond measure. The heavy sentence of 20 years imposed on him manifests that the rule of law is upheld and justice is done. Lai had long used Apple Daily to poison the minds of the people of Hong Kong by inciting hatred, distorting facts, deliberately stirring up social antagonism and glorifying violence. He has openly begged for external forces to impose sanctions against China and the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region), sacrificing the well-being of the people of China and Hong Kong. He caused damage to the interests of the country and the Hong Kong SAR. His conviction is supported by overwhelming evidence, and he deserves the punishment after all the harm that he has done.

The court pointed out clearly in its verdict handed down earlier that Lai was the mastermind of the case. He had manipulated and exploited Apple Daily to poison society and colluded with external forces to beg for sanctions and hostile activities against China and the Hong Kong SAR. Lai's malicious plot spanned across both the periods before and after the promulgation of the Hong Kong National Security Law. His intent was to collude with external forces to harm the interests of China and the Hong Kong SAR, as well as those of the people. He has shamelessly acted as a pawn of external forces to endanger national security.

The court has already handed down heavy sentences for Lai and the other defendants in accordance with the law, manifesting that the rule of law is upheld and justice is done. That said, Hong Kong as a whole has already paid a heavy price. Poisoned by Lai and Apple Daily under his control, some of our citizens, especially young people, have been misled to break the law and become radical and violent. During the period of ""black violence"", they committed acts of vandalism on public facilities. Not only did they storm the buildings of the Hong Kong SAR Government, the Legislative Council and offices of the Central Government in Hong Kong, they also threw petrol bombs, committed arson and even set people on fire. Furthermore, some young people smuggled real guns, made bombs and made plans for terrorist activities. It was fortunate that the Police promptly cracked down on these plots and prevented mass casualties. However, many young people who had been incited to commit crimes eventually ended up in prison. As of the end of last year, more than 2 400 individuals have to face legal consequences for unlawful acts during the period of ""black violence"". It is plain to see that the evil deeds committed by Lai and his syndicate were beyond measure.

The Hong Kong SAR Government has completed the local legislation on Article 23 of the Basic Law and enacted the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance. The Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance are complementary to each other to establish the legal protection for safeguarding national security. They also protect the legitimate rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR will do all its best to prevent, suppress and punish acts and activities that endanger national security, fulfilling its responsibility of the most righteousness.

Since we took action against a lot of syndicates who were involved in crimes related to endangering national security, western countries and also politicians and organisations have been bad-mouthing Hong Kong's righteous action to protect national security. They are doing this, of course, for their political agenda. A lot try to cause trouble in Hong Kong so as to cause trouble to our country, China. Thanks to the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, we now have the tools to take action against all these illegal activities and acts. We will resolutely fulfil our duty to safeguard national security, despite all the political attempts that try to smear our righteous action of safeguarding national security. They all do this for obvious reasons. Some of the people we are taking action against are their pawns, are their representatives, and are under their influence to endanger Hong Kong's and our country's national security. It will be against their interests that we successfully neutralise their attempts. These attacks, I expect, will continue, because this is something they will not stop in order to ensure that their own national security interests override others'. Certainly, I will not allow that to happen.

Regarding sentence, the DoJ (Department of Justice) and the Police will study in detail the judgment and the reasons and consider it fully.

Regarding Wang Fuk Court, I attach great interest and importance to the long-term accommodation arrangements for residents of Wang Fuk Court, and the Government has been continuing to provide suitable assistance to the affected families. For the issues that the Government has to resolve are really complicated, because each household has its own circumstances and needs, and there are also very diverse opinions in society. The Government carefully considers and deals with the various views and takes into account some very practical issues, such as the appropriate use of public resources, the allocation of public funds, the distribution of housing resources, and the relevant legal ownership-related responsibilities and challenges.

The Government also needs to properly manage the transitional arrangements of accommodation. Timely action is crucial. The sooner we can make available the options for residents to choose, the better. The Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements, led by the Deputy Financial Secretary, has been working incessantly to develop a concrete plan in the following directions. First, to consider the wishes of the affected families while ensuring the efficient use of resources and balancing empathy, reason and law. Second, to provide multiple options to affected families, including Home Ownership Scheme and Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme flats, as well as Hong Kong Housing Society units. And also third, to offer accommodation arrangements, either within Tai Po or across different districts.

Through the ""one social worker per household"" service, the task force collected preliminary preferences from affected flat owners. Currently, responses from them have largely been received. The task force is working intensively to compile and analyse flat owners' preferences regarding different options. Initial observations indicate that the vast majority of owners hope the Government will expedite the handling of long-term rehousing work. A significant proportion of flat owners have expressed willingness to consider the Government's acquisition of their ownership rights. Some flat owners have indicated that they need to look at the actual acquisition price.

The task force is currently working hard to overcome some of the following issues, which pose difficulties and challenges. First, how to handle the differing needs of various families in a consistent manner. Second, issues regarding liability, compensation uncertainty and relevant legal matters concerning the public insurance of Wang Fuk Court. Third, whether ownership-related responsibility and legal disputes will pose risks of prolonged delays in resolution. I have instructed the task force to promptly study the feasibility of various options and the legal issues, seek advice from the Department of Justice and propose arrangements as soon as possible.

I understand this is no easy time for families of Wang Fuk Court. The Government will work tirelessly to finalise the plan as soon as possible, enable affected families to make the most suitable choices, and assist them in rebuilding their homes and resuming their normal lives as quickly as possible.

Regarding our arrangements, of course, we may have to use some public funding. The Government will prudently make assessments and make appropriate arrangements to ensure that public funds are used effectively, striking a balance between the needs of the residents and the reasonable use of public resources. Thank you.

​行政長官歡迎並全力支持和履行《「一國兩制」下香港維護國家安全的實踐》白皮書,2026-02-10 13:00,2026-02-10 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000257.htm,"就國務院新聞辦公室今日（二月十日）發布《「一國兩制」下香港維護國家安全的實踐》白皮書（《白皮書》），行政長官李家超表示十分歡迎，會全力支持和履行《白皮書》的內容和要求並發表以下聲明：

行政長官李家超十分歡迎和全力支持中央政府發布《「一國兩制」下香港維護國家安全的實踐》白皮書。他表示，作為香港特別行政區（特區）首長、當家人，會領導和統籌特區行政、立法、司法履行《白皮書》的內容和要求，全力維護國家主權、安全和發展利益。

《白皮書》指出，中央政府從醞釀提出「一國兩制」科學構想到全面實施「一國兩制」方針，始終堅定維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，保持香港長期繁榮穩定。《白皮書》從五個方面闡述了香港維護國家安全的鬥爭從未停止、中央政府對香港有關的國家安全事務負有根本責任、香港特區切實履行維護國家安全的憲制責任、香港實現由亂到治走向由治及興、以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展。

首先，《白皮書》闡明了香港維護國家安全的鬥爭從未停止。回歸後，香港《基本法》第二十三條立法長期是鬥爭焦點，很長一個時期香港特區未能完成《基本法》第二十三條立法，令反中亂港勢力和外部敵對勢力有機可乘，修例風波最終演變成港版「顏色革命」，「港獨」猖獗、「黑暴」肆虐、「攬炒」橫行，嚴重挑戰「一國兩制」原則底線，嚴重損害香港憲制秩序和法治，嚴重危害國家主權、安全、發展利益，也愈加凸顯香港特區在維護國家安全方面存在的法律漏洞和機制短板。

李家超表示對此深有感觸。他表示，香港回歸後很長一段時期，受到反中亂港分子和境外勢力干預和破壞，香港特區遲遲未能完成《基本法》第二十三條本地立法。這些破壞力量裏應外合，不斷挑戰「一國兩制」原則底線，組織各種顛覆破壞活動，包括二○一二年「反國教」、二○一四年非法「佔中」、二○一六年「旺角暴亂」、二○一九年「黑暴」、港版「顏色革命」等。「黑暴」期間，暴徒焚燒國旗、污損國徽、撕毀《基本法》，衝擊政府總部、立法會和中央駐港機構，鼓吹「香港獨立」，肆無忌憚企圖顛覆政權、分裂國家，香港局勢岌岌可危。今天，我們已止暴制亂，在由亂到治邁向由治及興的征程上，在我們全力拼經濟、謀發展、搞建設、惠民生的同時，香港要牢記國家風險依然存在，可突如其來，不能好了傷疤忘了痛，不能忘記二○一九年的慘痛經歷和沉痛教訓。

第二，《白皮書》闡明中央政府對香港有關的國家安全事務負有根本責任。維護國家安全是中央事權，中央立法維護國家安全是國際慣例，各國皆然。在香港維護國家安全面臨最嚴峻的挑戰，且香港難以自行完成有關立法的情況下，中央行使憲制權力，從國家層面立法維護國家安全迫在眉睫、勢在必行。中央採取制定實施《香港國安法》、完善香港選舉制度等一系列標本兼治的舉措，有效維護了國家安全，有力維護了香港特區憲制秩序，沉重打擊了反中亂港勢力，對香港迅速止暴制亂、實現由亂到治的歷史性轉折發揮了決定性作用，在「一國兩制」實踐進程中具有重要的里程碑意義。

我們支持和感謝中央在香港危急關頭果斷出手，從國家層面制定《香港國安法》，並由香港特區在香港公布實施。《香港國安法》終結了香港回歸二十多年來國安不設防的漏洞，終結了當年遍及全港的「黑暴」。特區政府全力依法打擊危害國家安全的行為和活動，香港社會得以回復秩序，市民安心上班，學生正常上課，經濟發展重回正軌。

第三，《白皮書》闡明香港特區切實履行維護國家安全的憲制責任。《白皮書》指出，《香港國安法》公布實施以來，香港特區行政長官和政府敢於擔當、善作善成，行政、立法、司法機關各司其職，積極防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，進一步築牢香港維護國家安全的屏障。《白皮書》指出，香港特區歷史性完成《基本法》第二十三條立法，履行了長期未完成的憲制責任；香港特區執法、檢控、司法部門無畏無懼、恪盡職守，依法打擊危害國家安全犯罪；香港特區政府持續加強宣傳教育，不斷增強香港居民國家安全意識。

事實上，在二○二○年六月三十日，《香港國安法》實施後，止暴制亂成效立竿見影，市民切身感受到安全的重要和社會穩定的可貴。之後在二○二四年三月十九日，《維護國家安全條例》在立法會獲全票通過，並於三月二十三日刊憲生效，香港特區成功履行《基本法》第二十三條本地立法的憲制責任，終於完成等待了二十六年八個月零十九天的歷史使命。《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》兼容互補、渾然一體，共同構建香港維護國家安全的堅實屏障，切實保障香港居民依法享有的權利和自由，為香港的安全和發展提供穩固的基礎。

第四，《白皮書》闡明香港實現由亂到治走向由治及興。《白皮書》指出，經過中央政府和香港特區的共同努力，香港維護國家安全工作取得歷史性成就、發生歷史性變革：香港的政權安全得到有效維護，治理效能顯著提升；法治尊嚴得到有力捍衛，社會秩序恢復穩定；香港營商環境持續優化，為市場注入了強大的穩定性、確定性、可預期性；香港市民依法享有各項權利自由有了更好保障，福祉日益增進。

實踐證明，在《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》的護佑下，香港社會安定繁榮，市民的正常生活和發展獲得有力保障，國際評級機構持續對香港給予正面評價。香港穩居全球最自由經濟體榜首，國際金融中心和世界競爭力皆排名全球第三，人才競爭力重返全球十大，安全城市排名維持全球十大等。安全帶來穩定，穩定創造發展，香港實現由亂到治走向由治及興的新征程，前景風光無限。

第五，《白皮書》闡明以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展必須把握的實踐要求。《白皮書》指出，新時代新征程，必須以總體國家安全觀為指導，牢牢把握「一國兩制」下維護國家安全的實踐要求，堅定不移建設高水平安全，護航「一國兩制」實踐行穩致遠，包括堅持中央的根本責任和特區的憲制責任相統一；堅持把特區管治權牢牢掌握在愛國者手中；堅持尊重和保障人權；堅持在法治軌道上維護安全；堅持統籌發展與安全；堅持在開放中維護安全。

我們清楚意識到，當前，世界百年未有之大變局加速演進，地緣政治局勢日趨複雜，局部地區衝突頻繁，單邊主義、保護主義抬頭，全球不穩定因素增加，香港面對的國家安全風險變化莫測。我們必須以「總體國家安全觀」為指引，堅定維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，堅持中央的根本責任和特區的憲制責任相統一，把維護國家安全貫穿「一國兩制」實踐全過程。同時，我們要繼續全面落實「愛國者治港」原則，確保特區管治權牢牢掌握在愛國者手中，堅持和完善行政主導；堅持尊重和保障人權，堅持在法治軌道上維護安全，保持香港普通法制度，健全特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制；堅持統籌發展與安全，在新形勢下更加重視非傳統領域安全；堅持在開放中維護安全，在高水平安全保障下推進高水平開放。

特區政府會透過不同渠道，持續加強宣傳教育，帶領和鼓勵社會各界深入學習和領會《白皮書》的重要內涵和要求，增強市民的國家安全意識。政府將會舉行《「一國兩制」下香港維護國家安全的實踐》白皮書研討會，並會將《白皮書》的全文上載到政府新聞網及基本法網頁。李家超鼓勵社會各界，包括政黨、社團、組織等，舉辦有關《白皮書》的學習和交流活動，加深市民對香港維護國家安全方面的意識和正確理解，自覺維護國家安全。

安全是發展的前提，發展是安全的保障。特區政府在維護國家安全和推動發展經濟上堅定不移，全力以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展，並以高質量發展實現高水平安全，讓社會發展有更好的保障，市民有更好的生活。"

AFCD reminds visitors to pay attention to hiking safety during holidays,2026-02-10 12:25,2026-02-10 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000269.htm,"In light of the expected increase in visitors to country parks during the upcoming holiday, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) today (February 10) appeals to the public to pay attention to safety, observe the Guidelines and Code for Visiting Country Parks, and use designated hiking trails managed and maintained by the AFCD.

The AFCD anticipates that visitor numbers will be particularly high around the East Dam of the High Island Reservoir in Sai Kung during the holiday period. The department will closely monitor the situation, and if necessary, implement crowd management measures at the entrance of the High Island Geo Trail - Po Pin Chau Section. Visitors may be required to queue up to avoid overcrowding at the scenic spot. Visitors are reminded to pay attention to and follow the instructions of on-site staff.

The AFCD has placed information boards and direction signs at appropriate locations in country parks. Warning signs have also been erected near locations with dangerous terrains to remind visitors not to get close to dangerous areas to avoid accidents. Visitors must follow the direction signs, stay on designated hiking trails, refrain from crossing railings, and avoid standing close to cliff edges or coastal fringes, steep slopes or other dangerous locations. Visitors must prioritise their personal safety and should not take risks by using shortcuts or for the sake of taking photos or sightseeing.

The AFCD reminds visitors to protect the natural environment, and practice ""Take Your Litter Home"" and hiking etiquette. Camping is permitted only at designated campsites, and fire can only be used at designated barbecue sites or campsites. Do not disturb or harm wild animals and plants or cause a nuisance to other visitors. Country parks are extremely valuable natural resources. Caring for the natural environment and keeping it clean are every visitor's responsibility. Visitors should keep the area clean and be considerate when camping and using public facilities. Do not shout, and only use fire in stoves or barbecue pits at designated locations to prevent damage to the surrounding environment. Anyone littering in country parks is liable to a fixed penalty of $3,000. The AFCD will step up patrols at ecotourism hotspots, strengthen publicity and education, and take enforcement action against any irregularities.

The AFCD promotes comprehensive trail information through the ""Enjoy Hiking"" website (www.hiking.gov.hk) to help visitors select suitable routes. Visitors should pay attention to weather conditions and hike with family and friends where possible. The website also provides detailed information on various hiking trails, including trail length, difficulty and nearby facilities, enabling visitors to plan trips according their personal conditions. The website also lists out high risk locations with records of fatal and serious accidents in country parks, with a view to reminding visitors to avoid these areas.

HKSAR Government strongly condemns external forces for slandering and smearing court's sentencing in Lai Chee-ying case,2026-02-10 00:33,2026-02-10 00:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000016.htm,"Regarding the court's sentencing yesterday (February 9) for Lai Chee-ying and the other eight defendants, as well as three companies relating to Apple Daily in respect of their convictions of a total of three charges of offences endangering national security, the western countries, anti-China media, organisations and politicians have used this as a pretext to slander, smear, and attack the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). They have even maliciously disparaged the court's independent judgement and sentence handed down in accordance with the law. The HKSAR Government firmly opposed and strongly condemned such despicable conduct.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""'Lai Chee-ying case' was the first convicted case of the offence of 'collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security' since the promulgation and implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL). This marks an important milestone in the HKSAR's efforts to safeguard national security, manifesting the role of the HKNSL as a key stabilising force. This case also admonishes that villains who endanger national security could never escape the sanctions of the law and would surely be severely punished in accordance with the law. Under the robust protection of the HKNSL, the attempts by external forces to 'use Hong Kong to contain China' are doomed to fail, leaving them with no option but only to smear and vilify the HKSAR's efforts to safeguard national security with futile and despicable political manoeuvres which would be in vain. By distorting facts and reversing right and wrong, their malicious intent has been seen through by all and must be resolutely refuted to set the record straight.""

The HKSAR spokesperson stressed, ""In Lai Chee-ying's case, after 156 days of fair and impartial public hearings, the court has considered the irrefutable evidence of up to 2 220 exhibits, over 80 000 pages of documents and statements of evidence from 14 prosecution witnesses. The court pointed out clearly that Lai Chee-ying was the mastermind of the case. He had manipulated and exploited Apple Daily to poison the society, and repeatedly colluded with external forces to beg for sanctions and hostile activities against the Central Authorities and the HKSAR Government. Even after the enactment of the HKNSL, all the defendants continued with their agreement for some time until after they were arrested by the Police. The court clearly pointed out that Lai Chee-ying's only intent was to seek the downfall of the Communist Party of China even though the ultimate cost was the sacrifice of the interests of the people of China and the HKSAR. Lai Chee-ying has brought harm to our country and Hong Kong; his evil deeds were beyond measure, and he for sure deserves his punishment after all the harm he has done.""

The spokesperson reiterated, ""The court clearly pointed out in the reasons for verdict that Lai Chee-ying was not on trial for his political views or beliefs. The court's publicly released reasons for verdict and sentence have meticulously explain the court's analysis of the relevant legal principles and evidence, as well as the reasons of the conviction and sentencing of Lai Chee-ying and the three defendant companies, which are well-founded and reasoned, with absolutely no basis for claims of so-called 'political prosecution'.""

In response to views suggesting that the severe sentencing of the defendants in the Lai Chee-ying case would affect the HKSAR's freedom of the press, a spokesperson for the HKSAR Government emphasised, ""The Lai Chee-ying case has nothing to do with freedom of the press at all. Over the years, the defendants were using journalism as a guise to commit acts that brought harm to our country and Hong Kong.""

""Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law. The HKNSL and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security. Any suggestion that certain individuals or organisations should be immune from legal consequences for their illegal acts is no different from advocating a special privilege to break the law, and this totally runs contrary to the spirit of the rule of law.""

In response to views that the prosecution and trial of the Lai Chee-ying case took too long, causing unfairness to the defendants, the spokesperson pointed out, ""All cases concerning offence endangering national security are handled by the prosecution and judicial authorities of the HKSAR in a fair and timely manner in strict compliance with Article 42(1) of the HKNSL, with the procedural rights of defendants exercised in accordance with the law fully respected throughout the process. Regarding Lai Chee-ying's case, the three counts of conspiracies were meticulously planned, the case was complex and involved a huge volume of evidence. Prosecution witnesses gave an elaborated account of the three counts of conspiracies in court. Lai Chee-ying himself even testified in court for 52 days. The time taken from investigation to trial was entirely reasonable, and there was absolutely no question of any so-called unfairness.""

""Besides, the HKSAR Government noticed that certain individuals with ulterior motives have been fabricating lies about Lai Chee-ying's health conditions and his custodial arrangements. Facts speak louder than eloquence. The Correctional Services Department (CSD) has been ensuring that the custodial environment for persons-in-custody (PICs) is safe, humane, appropriate and healthy in accordance with the law. These include adequate lighting and good ventilation, as well as appropriate and timely medical support. The HKSAR Government has also pointed out time and again that the arrangement of removing Lai Chee-ying from association with other PICs, it has long been made based on his own request by the CSD after considering all relevant factors in accordance with the law. Lai Chee-ying's entitlements in prison, including visitation, communication, welfare and religious services, as well as outdoor exercise arrangements, have not been deprived of on account of his personal status or his removal from association with other PICs.""

""During the plea in mitigation in court on January 12 and 13 this year, the senior counsel representing Lai Chee-ying confirmed repeatedly that Lai Chee-ying had made no complaints about the treatment he received while in custody. The court also confirmed in its reasons for sentence that the CSD has been providing adequate medical attention for Lai Chee-ying.""

The spokesman reiterated, ""The HKSAR Government will continue to uphold its constitutional duty and steadfastly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests. It will, as always, resolutely and strictly adhere to the principle of the rule of law to ensure that 'laws are observed and strictly enforced to bring offenders to account', so as to prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security while protecting the lawful rights and interests of Hong Kong residents and other people in Hong Kong. The HKSAR Government urges all sides to recognise the objective facts and stop any baseless malicious attacks."""
特區政府強烈譴責外部勢力污衊抹黑法庭就「黎智英案」的判刑,2026-02-09 22:06,2026-02-09 22:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900856.htm,"就法庭今日（二月九日）依法就黎智英及另外八名被告，以及《蘋果日報》相關三間公司干犯的危害國家安全罪行作出的判刑，多個美西方國家、反華媒體、組織及政客等藉此針對香港特別行政區（特區）作出污衊抹黑和攻擊，甚至詆毀法庭依法獨立作出的裁決及判刑，特區政府堅決反對此等卑劣行徑，並予以強烈譴責。

特區政府發言人表示:「『黎智英案』是《香港國安法》公布實施後第一宗獲判罪成的『串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全』案件，是香港特區維護國家安全工作的重要里程碑。《香港國安法》彰顯了『定海神針』的作用，告誡危害國家安全的歹毒之徒難逃法網，必被依法嚴懲。在《香港國安法》的堅實保障下，外部勢力『以港遏華』的圖謀無法得逞，只好針對香港特區維護國家安全的努力作出抹黑詆毀等徒勞無功的卑劣政治操弄，歪曲事實、顛倒是非，其險惡用心昭然若揭，必須直斥其非，以正視聽。」

特區政府發言人強調：「在『黎智英案』中，法庭經過156日公平公正的公開聆訊，審視了多達2 220項證物、超過80 000頁文件、14名控方證人的證供，鐵證如山。法庭已經清楚指出，黎智英為案中主腦，控制和利用《蘋果日報》荼毒社會，多次勾結外國勢力，乞求對中央和香港特區政府實施制裁和採取敵對行動。即使在《香港國安法》實施後所有被告仍然繼續推展其犯罪協議，甚至被拘捕後仍沒有立即停止。法庭明確指出，黎智英的唯一意圖就是，即使要犧牲中國和香港特區人民的利益，也要謀求中國共產黨倒台。黎智英禍國害港，惡貫滿盈，罪有應得。」

發言人重申：「法庭在裁決理由中已清楚表明，黎智英並非因其政治觀點或信念受審。法庭公開的裁決理由及判刑理由已鉅細無遺地說明法庭對相關法律原則和證據的分析，以及就黎智英和三間被告公司定罪和判刑的考量，有理有節，完全不存在所謂的『政治檢控』。」

針對有意見認為「黎智英案」的被告被重判會對影響香港特區的新聞自由，特區政府發言人強調：「『黎智英案』與新聞自由完全無關，案中各被告多年來只是利用新聞報道為幌子，行禍國害港之實。」

「香港特區是法治社會，《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》明確訂明防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪，應當堅持法治原則。倡議某種背景的人不應就其違法行為和活動受到法律制裁，等同給予其犯法特權，完全違反法治精神。」

就有意見指「黎智英案」檢控和庭審時間過長，對各名被告造成不公，發言人指出：「檢控機關和司法機關嚴格履行《香港國安法》第四十二條第一款的責任，確保所有危害國家安全犯罪案件得到公正、及時辦理，過程中充分尊重被告人依法行使各項程序權利。就『黎智英案』而言，三項串謀屬精心策劃，性質複雜並牽涉大量證據，控方證人在庭上詳細道出三項串謀的來龍去脈，而黎智英本人更在庭上自辯達52天，案件調查至審訊所需的時間實屬合理，絕對不存在任何所謂不公的情況。」

「另外，特區政府留意到別有用心的人一直虛構黎智英的健康問題及就其羈押安排捏造謊言。事實勝於雄辯，懲教署一直嚴格按照法律規定，確保羈押環境安全、人道、合適和健康，包括充足的照明和良好的通風環境、合適和適時的醫療支援等。特區政府亦已經多次指出事實，就有關黎智英與其他在囚人士中止交往的安排，一直是按黎智英本人的意願，並考慮所有相關因素後由懲教署依法安排。黎智英的在囚權利，包括探訪、通訊、福利和宗教服務、戶外活動安排等，並不會因其個人身分或與其他在囚人士中止交往而被剝奪。」

「在今年一月十二至十三日法庭在聽取求情期間，代表黎智英的資深大律師更再三確認就黎智英在囚待遇沒有任何投訴。法庭在判刑理由中也確認，懲教署有為黎智英提供足夠的醫療服務。」

發言人重申：「香港特區繼續肩負憲制責任，堅定維護國家主權、安全、發展利益；並會一如既往，堅定不移，嚴格按照法治原則，堅持『有法必依、執法必嚴、違法必究』，依法有效防範、制止、懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，同時保障香港居民和在香港的其他人的合法權益。特區政府促請各方認清客觀事實，停止任何毫無根據的惡意攻擊。」"
再次錄得食物中毒個案群組　衞生防護中心提醒市民避免進食生蠔及注意食物安全,2026-02-09 22:05,2026-02-09 22:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900797.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心今日（二月九日）正調查兩宗有流行病學關連的食物中毒個案群組，共涉及八人。衞生防護中心呼籲市民保持個人、食物及環境衞生，預防經由食物傳播的疾病。

新增食物中毒個案群組
——————————

受影響的五男三女年齡介乎28歲至29歲。他們分別於一月三十一日及二月二日在中環干諾道中五號文華東方酒店的快船廊晚膳後，約25至75小時先後出現腹瀉、腹痛、嘔吐和發燒等病徵。

其中四名受影響人士已求醫，無須入院。全部受影響人士現時情況穩定。

初步調查顯示，受影響人士於上述食肆進食的共同食物包括生蠔、三文魚刺身、蟹腳和麵包蟹。食物環境衞生署（食環署）人員（包括食物安全中心和環境衞生部人員）已於二月六日到涉事餐廳調查，檢視食物處理流程和衞生，並抽取食物及環境樣本作化驗。食物安全中心現場調查發現受影響人士可能進食了生的食物引致食物中毒。食物安全中心已即時指示有關餐廳暫停供應涉事食物、清潔消毒處所，及向餐廳員工提供食物安全和環境衞生教育。所有新呈報的個案，均在食物安全中心採取防控措施前進食有關生的食物。

衞生防護中心及食物安全中心的調查仍然繼續。

諾如病毒食物中毒個案近期顯著增加
————————————————

衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「過去數周錄得的食物中毒個案持續增加，由去年十二月底每周錄得平均一宗個案，上升至上月每周平均四宗，二月開始更急增至30宗個案。一月十八日至二月九日期間已錄得37宗食物中毒個案（共影響115人），當中33宗（89%）與諾如病毒相關（共影響101人）。流行病學調查發現上述與諾如病毒相關的食物中毒個案的受影響人士全部在潛伏期內曾食用生蠔。受影響人士當中，有五人須留院治理，全部情況穩定。衞生防護中心已將全部食物中毒個案通知食物安全中心作出跟進。」

徐樂堅醫生解釋：「由於蠔隻以過濾大量海水的方式進食，如果養蠔或採蠔的水域水質帶有病原體，這些物質便會在蠔的體內積聚。生或未徹底煮熟的蠔是高風險食物，進食受污染及未經煮熟的蠔，可能感染經由食物傳染的疾病，例如諾如病毒、甲型肝炎病毒或其他細菌。鑑於近日與進食生蠔相關的食物中毒個案大幅上升，市民應提高警覺，盡量避免進食生蠔或未徹底煮熟的雙殼類海產，尤其是孕婦、幼童、長者、免疫力弱人士及肝病患者，以預防受到感染。」

徐樂堅醫生續說：「除了食物中毒，諾如病毒亦是引致急性腸胃炎的主要原因之一。我們的監測指標顯示本地急性腸胃炎的活躍程度自一月初起持續上升，包括院舍及學校的急性腸胃炎爆發個案，實驗室的檢測顯示超過六成是諾如病毒引致。此外，其他香港人的旅遊熱點近日的諾如病毒活躍程度亦持續上升，包括日本及韓國。市民外遊時要提高警覺，注意個人、環境及食物衞生，以減低受感染的風險。」

市民應採取預防措施
—————————

諾如病毒常引致食物中毒及急性腸胃炎，症狀包括噁心、嘔吐、腹瀉、腹痛、輕微發燒及不適。大部分患者一般會自行痊癒，症狀通常在一至三天內有所改善。

一般來說，諾如病毒在冬天（約十二月至三月期間）較為活躍。由於病毒具高度傳染性，受影響人士即使接觸少量病毒，亦有機會受感染。病毒可透過進食受污染的食物、接觸受感染人士的嘔吐物或排泄物，及接觸受污染的物件等不同途徑傳播，在人多聚集的地方，如學校、安老院舍等，有機會導致大規模爆發。

徐樂堅醫生說：「農曆新年假期將至，市民較多機會舉行派對安排食物到會或火鍋，要預防食物中毒，除了注意個人衞生，所有食物亦必須徹底清潔並煮熟後方可食用；處理貝類海產時，須洗淨外殼並去除內臟，才可進食。要預防急性腸胃炎及諾如病毒感染，必須經常保持雙手清潔，尤其在處理食物或進食前及如廁後。洗手時應以梘液和清水清潔雙手，搓手最少20秒，用水過清並用抹手紙或乾手機弄乾。由於酒精未能有效殺死諾如病毒，酒精搓手液不能代替使用梘液和清水潔手。」"
CHP reminds public not to consume raw oysters and observe food safety as two more food poisoning clusters reported,2026-02-09 22:05,2026-02-09 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900802.htm,"​The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (February 9) investigating two epidemiologically linked food poisoning clusters affecting a total of eight persons. The CHP reminded the public to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent foodborne diseases.

New food poisoning clusters
------------------------------------

The clusters involve five males and three females aged between 28 and 29. They developed diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting and fever about 25 to 75 hours after having dinner at Clipper Lounge, Mandarin Oriental Hotel, 5 Connaught Road Central, Central, on January 31 and February 2 respectively.

Four of the affected persons sought medical advice but did not require hospitalisation.All of the affected individuals are currently in stable condition.

A preliminary investigation revealed that the food items that the affected individuals had in common include raw oyster, salmon sashimi, crab leg and brown crab at the aforementioned restaurant. Officers of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (including personnel of the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch) conducted an investigation and examined the handling processes and food hygiene at the restaurant on February 6 and collected food and environmental samples for testing. The CFS's field investigation revealed that the affected persons may have contracted food poisoning from consuming raw food. The CFS immediately instructed the premises concerned to suspend serving the incriminated food items and to carry out cleaning and disinfection of the premises. The officers have also provided health education related to food safety and environmental hygiene to the staff of the premises. All of the newly reported cases consumed raw food concerned before preventive and control measures instituted by the CFS.

The investigation of the CHP and the CFS is ongoing.

Recent surge in norovirus-related food poisoning cases
------------------------------------------------------------------

""Food poisoning cases have continuously increased over the past few weeks, rising from one case a week on average in late December last year to four cases a week on average in January. A total of 30 cases have been recorded since February. Between January 18 and February 9, the CHP has recorded 37 food poisoning cases, affecting 115 persons. Among which, 33 cases (89 per cent) were related to norovirus, affecting 101 persons. Epidemiological investigation showed that all the affected persons of the food poisoning cases related to norovirus had consumed raw oysters during the incubation period. Among the affected persons, five persons were hospitalised for treatment. All are in stable condition. The CHP has notified the CFS on all the food poisoning cases for follow up,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""As oysters feed by filtering a large volume of seawater, pathogens can accumulate in them if they are grown in or harvested from contaminated water. Raw and partially cooked oysters are considered a high-risk food. Persons who consume undercooked or contaminated oysters may contract food-borne diseases such as norovirus, hepatitis A virus or other bacteria. In view of the drastic increase in food poisoning cases related to consumption of raw oysters recently, members of the public, especially pregnant women, young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems or liver diseases, shall stay vigilant and avoid consumption of raw oysters or partially cooked bivalve shellfish to prevent infection,"" Dr Tsui explained.

""In addition to food poisoning, norovirus can also cause acute gastroenteritis (AGE). According to the CHP's surveillance data, the AGE activity level has continued to increase since early January, including AGE outbreaksin institutions and schools. Laboratory testing indicated that over 60 per cent of the outbreaks were caused by norovirus.In addition, there have been increases in the norovirus activity in other popular travel destinations for Hong Kong citizens, including Japan and Korea. Members of the public should remain vigilant and maintain personal, environmental and food hygiene at all times to minimise the risk of being infected while travelling,"" Dr Tsui added.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------------

Norovirus infection typically causes food poisoning and AGE with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, low-grade fever and malaise. The symptoms are usually self-limiting and most people will get better within one to three days.

In general, norovirus is more active in winter (around December to March). As norovirus is highly contagious, individuals may become infected after being exposed to even a small amount of norovirus. The virus can be transmitted through various means, such as eating contaminated food, contacting with the vomit or excreta of infected persons, and contacting with contaminated objects. In settings where people are staying close together such as schools, elderly homes etc., there is a possibility of a large-scale outbreak.

""As the Lunar New Year holiday is approaching, members of the public have more opportunities to have parties with food delivery services or hotpot. To prevent food poisoning, apart from maintaining personal hygiene, they should also consume thoroughly washed and cooked food. For shellfish, the shells should be well scrubbed and the internal organs be removed before consumption. To prevent AGE and norovirus infection, members of public should perform hand hygiene frequently, especially before handling food or eating, and after using the toilet. Wash hands with liquid soap and water, and rub for at least 20 seconds, then rinse with water and dry with a disposable paper towel or hand dryer. Since alcohol is not effective in killing norovirus, alcohol-based handrubs are not a substitute for handwashing with soap and water,"" said Dr Tsui."

保安局局長就「黎智英案」判刑會見傳媒答問內容（附短片）,2026-02-09 20:41,2026-02-09 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900747.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（二月九日）下午就「黎智英案」判刑會見傳媒的答問內容：

記者：局長剛提及之前申請凍結資產，之後會充公，時間表和詳情是怎樣？除公司之外，是否其所有個人財產都會被充公呢？另外，黎智英干犯的罪行最高可被判終身監禁，但今次法庭的總刑期是20年，你對判刑的看法如何？

保安局局長：首先，我根據法例凍結了黎智英本人和《蘋果日報》三間相關公司的一些財產，政府會盡快根據法例，進行申請充公的程序。至於判刑，已經判了20年，法庭已清楚說明他牽涉罪行重大，兩項「串謀勾結外國勢力或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪的刑期，由原本15年，加多三年至18年。我們相信20年的刑罰已反映罪行的嚴重性。

記者：想問局長覺得有關判決是否有阻嚇性？另外，針對反華勢力對判決的評論，局長有何回應？

保安局局長：首先，就20年的判刑，剛才我已提過，其實在其串謀勾結外國勢力的罪行裏，原本判刑15年，但因為案件性質特別惡劣而加刑三年至18年。所以，加起來共被判20年的監禁，我相信反映了這案件的嚴重性。

對於一些外國的組織或政客繼續刻意抹黑我們，說我們打壓新聞自由，又說我們是政治檢控等，香港市民看得很清楚，其實這些全部都是虛假的指控。法庭裏的判刑說得很清楚，他們並沒有任何政治考慮，只是看犯罪的事實和法律而已，一切這些指控都是虛假的。另外就新聞自由，如果大家有留意法庭整個審訊過程，其實整件事就是黎智英利用《蘋果日報》去製造假新聞、假消息，煽動仇恨、煽動市民對政府不滿，鼓吹人們出來使用暴力。這些全部與新聞自由無關的，這些全部是犯罪行為。一個普通做記者、做新聞的人是不會做這些事情的，他的目的其實就是不理中國人民和香港人民所面對的苦難，即使犧牲你也好，也要達到的目的就是去推翻共產黨的政權。

至於「單獨囚禁」，這個我們已講過很多次，包括黎智英的律師自己在法庭也講過，是黎智英自己提出的。我希望你們不要再繼續自己騙自己，掩着耳朵不聽我們說，這個是黎智英自己提出的「單獨囚禁」。謝謝。

記者：想問黎智英是否不會獲得行為良好的三分一減刑？同樣其他認罪高層也不會獲得行為良好的減刑？另外，《蘋果日報》已經停刊，他們已經不再是蘋果的僱員，局長如何評估他們對國家安全不利？會否參考之前初選時趙家賢幫懲教署拍認罪悔改的短片才可以獲得減刑？

保安局局長：法例清楚説明，任何人干犯危害國家安全相關罪行，必須要在懲教署署長認為提早釋放犯人並不會不利國家安全，才會作出考慮。懲教署署長會因應個別案件、個別被告人，根據實際情況作出考量。

記者：如果英國引用移交協定安排，即是黎智英去英國服刑，請問政府會否配合？另外，請問會否考慮以黎智英和英國交換囚犯？譬如互換早前駐倫敦經貿辦（香港駐倫敦經濟貿易辦事處）間諜案的被告。

保安局局長：黎智英是中國人。他在中國香港犯法，他在中國香港服刑是非常合理的。

Reporter: What's the significance of this case, given that Jimmy Lai's sentencing of 20 years is the longest in all national security cases so far?

Secretary for Security: I think the sentence of a total of 20 years' imprisonment has reflected the grave nature of the case. If you look at the judgment, in fact, for each of the conspiracy to commit collusion offences, the sentence has been increased from 15 years to 18 years with an additional sentence of three years. It is because the court has considered the grave nature of the case. I think the sentence in this case illustrates very clearly that any offence against national security, in particular colluding with foreign forces or external elements, is a very serious offence.

Reporter: I have a follow-up question about what you said on the United Kingdom (UK) situation. As his side or his children had said that Jimmy Lai is only a British citizen, he only holds a British passport, how do you compare that to the version of what you just said? And if the UK asks for a transfer of sentenced persons agreement, how do you think the Government will respond?

Secretary for Security: Lai Chee-ying, according to the law of Hong Kong and the law of China, is a Chinese, and we do not recognise dual nationality. Being a Chinese who committed an offense in Hong Kong, China, he serves his sentence in Hong Kong, China, which is a very logical stance. Thank you.

Members of the delegation include representatives from the General Administration of Customs of the PRC, the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Department of Commerce of Guangdong Province.

 The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, met with the delegation at noon and expressed gratitude for their annual visit to Hong Kong ahead of the Chinese New Year to observe the situation of the food supply from the Mainland. He said that the relevant Mainland authorities have strengthened the sources of supply and enhanced contingency plans to ensure the stability and safety of the food supply, fully demonstrating the Central Authorities' care and support for Hong Kong. Mr Tse also shared with the delegation on how the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government rolls out various new food-related initiatives to align proactively with the National 15th Five-Year Plan.

 The delegation visited the Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse in the morning to observe the transportation, auction and slaughtering of live pigs supplied to Hong Kong. Accompanied by representatives of the Environment and Ecology Bureau, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, the delegation visited the Wan Chai Market and the Western Wholesale Food Market in the afternoon to observe the distribution and sale of fresh food.

 The Mainland is the primary source of agricultural products, especially live and fresh food, for Hong Kong. Relevant agencies on the Mainland have long attached great importance to the quality, safety and stability of food supplied to Hong Kong and have established a close liaison mechanism with Hong Kong. As the supply businesses of fresh food to Hong Kong have continued to grow on the Mainland, the quality and variety of food products supplied to Hong Kong have continued to improve, demonstrating the Central Government's care for the HKSAR and playing a crucial role in stabilising the supply and prices of fresh food to Hong Kong."

Today (February 9), the court handed down the sentence of the Lai Chee-ying case.

Key points of sentencing

Given the grave nature of the case, his total sentence is 20 years' imprisonment. As for the eight other defendants, their imprisonment sentences range from six years three months to 10 years.

Reasons for sentence

The court pointed out that Lai Chee-ying was the mastermind and driving force of the case. He has colluded with foreign forces to beg for sanctions against his country.


The court has emphasised that Lai Chee-ying had harboured his resentment and hatred of China for years.His only intent was to seek the downfall of the Chinese Communist Party, even though the ultimate cost would be the sacrifice of the people of China and that of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
The court held that the offence of ""conspiracy to print, publish, sell, offer for sale, distribute, display and/or reproduce seditious publications""in this case fell within the most serious category of its type, and the two offences of ""conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security""fell within the category of offences of a grave nature.
As the court pointed out in the reasons for the sentence, these offences took place at a time when Hong Kong had hardly recovered from the social turmoil caused by the ""black-clad violence"". The conspiracies were meticulously planned, involved multiple parties, and were clearly premeditated.Even after the enactment of the Hong Kong National Security Law, the defendants continued with their crimes for some time until after they were arrested by the Police.In fact, the sanctions imposed by foreign countries against the HKSAR, as well as against officials of China and the HKSAR have not been removed even up to today.The court clearly identified Lai Chee-ying as the mastermind behind these conspiracies, and therefore enhanced the starting point for his sentence.


The heavy sentence clearly reflects the very serious nature of the offences committed by Lai Chee-ying.

The court's judgment illustrates that the rule of law in Hong Kong is robust. Criminal acts will never be tolerated. No one is above the law.

Notwithstanding the punishment, irreparable harm has already been inflicted on our society. 

Over the years, Lai Chee-ying and his syndicate have misled people with fake news and false information.

Under Lai Chee-ying's control, Apple Daily, together with the external forces he colluded with, have poisoned young people by inciting hatred and glorifying violence, and driven Hong Kong into a state of frenzied radicalism during ""black-clad violence"". It was a time when humanity was at stake.

We still remember young people blocking roads, storming the LegCo (Legislative Council) building, and even beating up and setting on fire fellow citizens who held different views. Some even plotted terrorist activities to kill police officers and bomb hospitals.

It was fortunate that the Police had cracked down on these plots in time to prevent mass casualties and serious damages. But young people behind these terrorist activities had to face punishment by law.

Rebuttal of smearing comments

While our court has ruled independently and strictly in accordance with the law, external forces chose to ignore the facts, and criticise the case as a so-called ""political prosecution"".

Let me stress once again that the reasons for the verdict and reasons for the sentence handed down fully demonstrate that the court has arrived at the judgment in strict accordance with the law and the evidence.

As highlighted by the Chief Justice earlier, the courts in Hong Kong concern themselves only with the law and the evidence, not with any underlying matters of political, policies or other non-legal considerations.

Any suggestion that certain individuals should be immune from legal consequences for their illegal acts is no different from advocating a special privilege to break the law, and this totally runs contrary to the spirit of the rule of law.

The Lai Chee-ying case also has nothing to do with freedom of the press. If anything, the defendants have used journalism as a guise to harm our country and Hong Kong over the years. Thanks to the public trial, it is for all to see clearly how Lai Chee-ying has used Apple Daily to betray our country and our people.

Moreover, external forces have fabricated facts that Lai Chee-yinghad been unhealthy and ill-treated in prison, portraying him as a victim in an attempt to press for his unconditional release. But these claims are simply false.

Even Lai Chee-ying's own legal representative has clarified time and again that Lai Chee-ying has been receiving suitable treatment and care in prison with no complaints.

As regards the concern about Lai Chee-ying's removal from association from other persons in custody, or the so-called ""solitary confinement"", we have also repeated again and again that the arrangement has been made at Lai Chee-ying's own request.

Staying on guard against national security risks

Although Lai Chee-ying and other defendants will face legal sanctions they deserve, we must not overlook the national security risks the HKSAR is still facing from hostile external forces, and anti-China and destabilising elements absconded overseas.

The HKSAR Government will not watch with folded arms any acts that endanger our national security. We will pursue offenders vigorously regardless of distance until justice is done. We will refute baseless allegations and smearing resolutely by presenting the truth and facts for all to see. We will step up national security education to help our citizens better understand, and do their part in our combat against national security risks.

Closing remarks

Lastly, my heartfelt gratitude to the Judiciary, the Department of Justice, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Correctional Services Department, and all parties concerned for doing their part in bringing Lai Chee-ying and his syndicate to justice. I must also thank our fellow citizens for their support and for standing firm even in challenging times.

The HKSAR Government will continue to unwaveringly and fearlessly prevent, suppress and punish acts and activities that endanger our national security in accordance with the law.
​
Thank you.

保安局局長就「黎智英案」判刑會見傳媒開場發言（附短片）,2026-02-09 19:20,2026-02-09 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900668.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（二月九日）下午就「黎智英案」判刑會見傳媒的開場發言：

​各位香港市民、各位記者朋友，大家好。

​較早前（二○二五年十二月十五日），高等法院原訟法庭已就黎智英及《蘋果日報》三間相關公司被控一共三項危害國家安全罪行的案件（「黎智英案」）作出定罪裁決。三位法官在今日（二月九日）就該案的各名被告，包括黎智英和其餘八名被告，以及《蘋果日報》相關三間公司作出判刑。

判刑要點

法庭在今日頒下的判刑理由指出黎智英為案中主腦和推手，更多次親自勾結外國勢力，乞求對中央和香港特區政府實施制裁，還有進行敵對行動。法庭考慮到黎智英在案件的角色屬於罪行重大，所以最終重判其監禁二十年。

其實法庭在二○二五年十二月十五日頒下的定罪裁決理由中已經明確指出，黎智英長年對中國懷有怨憤和憎恨。無論在《香港國安法》實施之前或之後，黎智英的唯一意圖就是，即使要犧牲中國和香港特區人民的利益，亦要謀求中國共產黨倒台。

法庭裁定黎智英所犯的「勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」屬罪行重大。法庭的定罪判決和判刑彰顯法律的正義，維護了香港的核心價值。

其餘八名早前已認罪的被告分別被判監禁六年三個月至十年不等。《蘋果日報》三間相關公司各被判罰款$3,004,500，即合共判罰$9,013,500。

判刑理由

正如法庭的判刑理由中所指出，法庭裁定本案的「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及／或複製煽動刊物罪」屬於最嚴重的級別；而兩項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」，屬於罪行重大。

在《香港國安法》實施後，所有被告仍然繼續犯罪，甚至被拘捕後仍未立即停止。

事實上，外國針對中國和香港特區政府官員採取的制裁措施，至今仍未撤銷，法庭清楚指出黎智英是本案的主腦和推手，是加重他罪責的因素。

今次判刑清楚顯示法庭認同被告所犯的罪行非常嚴重，必須嚴懲。黎智英和其團夥作惡連連，過去多年來以假消息、假新聞誤導市民、荼毒青年，甚至煽動仇恨、宣揚和美化暴力，還為反中亂港分子提供資金，引發港版「顏色革命」，令全港市民受到無盡的苦難和創傷。法庭對本案的定罪和判刑，正好說明法律絕不容許任何公然傷害自己國家、同胞和危害國家安全的犯罪行為。香港是法治之地，沒有任何人可以凌駕於法律之上。

雖然法庭已經依法對黎智英和各被告作出重判，但他們對社會已經造成難以彌補的傷害。很多原本善良的市民，特別是年輕人，在黎智英和其所操控的《蘋果日報》，以及他們勾結的外部勢力的荼毒下，在「黑暴」期間變得瘋狂激進，錯誤地認為使用暴力去解決問題是正確的。他們除了衝擊立法會、四處作出破壞，更加對持不同政見的市民和執法人員擲磚頭、擲汽油彈、將他們打到血流披面，更甚是做出縱火燒人等滅絕人性的行為。在當時人性的底線被踐踏、價值觀都被嚴重扭曲的情況下，我們甚至看見有年輕人策劃恐怖活動、製造炸彈。幸好警方及早搗破這些計劃，才可以避免造成大量市民的傷亡。這些被煽動唆擺而犯案的年輕人最終要承擔法律責任，鋃鐺入獄。

即使社會如今已經恢復秩序，但仍然有少數激進分子依然迷信違法暴力的謬論。例如近日有團夥嘗試組織非法操練而被警方偵破和拘捕。

反駁抹黑

自特區政府依法打擊黎智英危害國家安全的罪行以來，多個美西方國家、反華媒體、組織和政客，甚至國際組織，聲稱案件是所謂的政治檢控，持續故意將黎智英的犯罪行為與新聞自由混為一談，刻意為黎智英洗白，無視他操弄媒體以煽動大眾，還有出賣國家和人民利益，為外部勢力作滲透和對年輕人進行洗腦的顛覆工作等的無恥行為。

他們更捏造黎智英健康不佳，刻意為其塑造悲情形象和「賣慘」，以此要求特區政府以健康和年紀等理由將其釋放。

我必須再次強調一點，法庭已經在裁決理由中清楚表明，黎智英絕非因為其政治觀點或信念受審。法庭在早前頒下長達855頁的裁決理由中，已充分展現法庭嚴格依照法律和證據作出裁決，不受任何干涉，更絕無任何政治考量，所謂「政治檢控」的指控完全是子虛烏有。

正如終審法院首席法官張舉能在今年法律年度開啟典禮的致辭中強調，香港特區法庭判案只着眼法律和證據，而不是背後的任何政治或政策，又或者與法律無關的因素。法治其中一個基本信念就是無人能夠凌駕於法律之上。無論任何案件，如果要求基於被告的職業、背景或政治因素等原因而要求提前釋放他，就是直接衝擊法治的核心。而針對法官行使獨立司法權就案件作出公正裁決，外部勢力竟然威脅要對法官施加制裁，實質是以有違法治的方式企圖干預司法獨立，這些恐嚇行為與貪腐賄賂沒有分別，都是破壞公義的手段。我想指出雖然包庇罪犯和制裁法官的荒謬行徑，可能在提出這些無理要求的人的國家是司空見慣，他們甚至認為侵佔他人的國家資源都是理所當然，但香港是文明法治社會，不是人治社會，無論市民、社會還是政府，香港都絕對不能接受這些卑劣行為。

此外，「黎智英案」與新聞自由完全無關。案中各被告多年來，只是利用新聞報道作為幌子，煽動仇恨，行禍國害港之實。在本案公開審訊中，揭示了黎智英親自操控《蘋果日報》，其實並沒有真正的編採自主，就如審訊期間其中一名前蘋果高層人員在法庭上所講，有的只是「鳥籠」自主。

至於黎智英的健康狀況，特區政府留意到外部勢力企圖捏造事實誤導公眾。特區政府已多次強調，黎智英在羈押期間所獲得的醫療服務是完備的。事實上，在二○二六年一月十三日法庭聽取求情期間，代表黎智英的資深大律師亦多次確認黎智英沒有就其在囚期間的待遇提出過任何投訴。

至於經常有人聲稱黎智英被迫接受所謂的單獨囚禁的安排，到今日還有人繼續「擘大眼講大話」，拒絕去接受事實，就是黎智英與其他囚犯中止交往這個安排一直都是根據其本人的意願而作出，並非懲教署的主動安排。

跟進工作

至於案件的跟進工作方面，我早前已根據《香港國安法》第四十三條實施細則凍結黎智英和《蘋果日報》三間相關公司涉案罪行有關的財產。由於法庭已經判刑，特區政府將會適時依法向法庭申請充公令，沒收與罪行有關的犯罪得益。特區政府亦會根據《香港國安法》第三十一條規定，啓動程序，根據《公司（清盤及雜項條文）條例》第360C條，盡快將《蘋果日報》三間相關公司從公司登記冊中剔除。

國家安全風險仍須嚴防

雖然黎智英和其團夥已經受到法律懲罰，但從法庭審訊、裁決以至判刑理由中，都揭露了香港特區仍然面對國家安全風險，包括外部敵對勢力一直藉本案抹黑攻擊特區政府依法履行維護國家安全的重要職責，甚至對中央和特區政府的官員實施所謂「制裁」。同時，潛逃海外的反中亂港分子，包括指明潛逃者和通緝犯，在外部勢力的包庇下繼續從事危害國家安全的行為和活動，煽動市民對中央和特區政府的憎恨。

對於這些外部勢力的惡意抹黑和攻擊，特區政府必須嚴正反駁，將事實呈現給香港市民和全世界知道。我們亦會繼續做好國安宣傳教育工作，提升市民慎思明辨的能力、加強他們的守法意識、國安意識和國家意識，這樣才不會輕易受到「軟對抗」所迷惑。

結語

最後，我要再次衷心感謝司法機構、律政司、警務處、懲教署和所有相關人員。他們面對外部勢力的抹黑、恐嚇甚至制裁，始終堅守崗位，盡力將犯罪分子繩之於法，終於令黎智英和其團夥受到法律制裁，切實維護社會安寧，讓下一代能夠在安穩的環境中成長。

我亦要感謝香港市民，支持國安教育，令全民的國家安全意識得以顯著提升，反中亂港分子不能像以往般猖獗。當面對危害國家安全的行為時，大家不再沉默和啞忍，勇敢挺身而出，堅決反對暴力，積極維護社會秩序。

維護國家安全是所有人的應有義務，亦是香港特區的憲制責任。在目前風高浪急的地緣政治局勢下，特區政府會繼續堅定不移、無畏無懼地依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，確保「一國兩制」實踐行穩致遠。"

中心發言人說：「中心分兩期進行是項時令食品調查，第一期調查結果已於上月公布。農曆新年將至，第二期賀年食品調查亦已完成，中心從不同零售商（包括網上零售商）抽取了糕點（如蘿蔔糕和年糕）、油器（如煎堆和油角）、糖果、湯圓、果仁、開心果、瓜子、齋菜及海味等樣本進行化學測試。化學檢測包括防腐劑、染色料、抗氧化劑和獸藥殘餘等。」

發言人提醒業界配製食品和製作標籤時，須遵從有關法例規定，並符合「優良製造規範」，適當地使用法例准許的食物添加劑。零售商應向可靠的供應商採購食物，了解所接收物料和製成品的質素，確保其採用的材料符合法定標準。此外，業界須遵從《食物安全條例》的要求，保存良好的紀錄，以便在有需要時追查食物來源。

發言人亦建議消費者到可靠和衞生的店鋪購買賀年食物。購買預先包裝的糕點和小食時，要留意包裝是否完好及食用期限，亦應參考包裝上的營養標籤，了解食物中的糖、鈉（鹽）、飽和脂肪和反式脂肪等含量，以作出知情的選擇。選購散裝食品（如糖蓮子、果仁及瓜子）時，則要注意食物容器是否清潔及店鋪員工的個人衞生情況。

發言人說：「市民應選購色澤自然的食品，留意特別亮白的開心果可能經過漂白加工，而表面有不尋常光澤的瓜子則可能添加了礦物油，食用這些食品可引致腸胃不適。」

他續說：「購買糕點後，如非即時食用，應放入雪櫃或按包裝上的說明存放，並應在食用限期前食用。就熱食的糕點，在進食前應先徹底翻熱，並盡快食用，避免長時間放於室溫。至於果仁及瓜子等食品，不可貯存過久。若發現食品發霉或有異味，便不應進食。」

發言人提醒市民保持均衡飲食，即使在新年期間，亦要盡量避免過量進食高能量、高糖分、高鹽分或高脂肪的食品。

Centre for Food Safety announces test results of Lunar New Year food (second phase) (with photo),2026-02-09 19:17,2026-02-09 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900611.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (February 9) announced the test results of a recently completed seasonal food surveillance project on Lunar New Year (LNY) food (second phase). The test results on 175 samples collected were all satisfactory.

  A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS has conducted this seasonal food surveillance project in two phases, and the first-phase test results were announced last month. With the LNY around the corner, the CFS has completed the second phase of the surveillance project on LNY food. Steamed puddings (e.g. turnip puddings and festive cakes), fried dumplings (e.g. sesame balls and crispy triangles), candies, glutinous rice balls, nuts, pistachio nuts, melon seeds, vegetarian dishes and dried aquatic products were collected from different retailers (including online retailers) for chemical analysis. Chemical tests targeted preservatives, colouring matters, antioxidants, veterinary drug residue, etc.""

  The spokesman urged the food trade to observe the relevant laws and regulations in the preparation of food and production of labels. They should follow Good Manufacturing Practice and use permitted food additives only in an appropriate manner. Retailers should source food from reliable suppliers and conduct quality checks of incoming materials and end products to ensure that ingredients used are within legal standards. In addition, the food trade should maintain proper records in accordance with the requirements of the Food Safety Ordinance to allow source tracing if needed.

  The spokesman also advised consumers to buy LNY food from reliable retailers with good hygiene conditions; make sure the packaging of prepackaged cakes and snacks is intact and the products have not expired; refer to the nutrition labels on the sugar, sodium (salt), saturated fat and trans fat content and more for making informed choices; and pay attention to the hygiene conditions of food containers and the personal hygiene of staff when buying loose-packed food (e.g. candied lotus seeds, nuts and melon seeds).

  ""Consumers should choose food products with natural colours. Bright white pistachios may have been bleached, and melon seeds with unnatural gloss may have had mineral oil added. Consumption of these food products can cause gastrointestinal discomfort,"" the spokesman said.

  ""Festive cakes that are not for immediate consumption should be kept refrigerated or stored according to the instructions on the package and should be eaten before they expire. Reheat hot-served festive cakes thoroughly before consumption, consume them as soon as possible, and avoid keeping them at room temperature for a long time. Foods like nuts and melon seeds should not be kept for a long time. Those with mould or an abnormal smell or taste should not be eaten,"" he added.

  The spokesman reminded the public to maintain a balanced diet and, as far as practicable, avoid excessive consumption of foods high in energy, sugar, salt or fat, even during the LNY.

尊敬的紀文鳳女士（周大福慈善基金理事）、何宗慈總裁（利希慎基金總裁）、閻德龍神父（香港明愛總裁）、各位嘉賓、各位街坊、各位朋友：

大家好！今日很開心來到西營盤，出席繼筲箕灣社區客廳後，在港島區的第二間社區客廳的開幕典禮。其實每次我去到一間新的社區客廳，都會發現又再有一些新的服務，而這一間給我很大的驚喜。我覺得現在不應叫作「社區客廳」，而是一間「會所」，因為又有咖啡、又有樂器，我家裏的客廳也沒有那麼多東西，所以這裏應該是「社區會所」。

社區客廳是特區政府推行幫助弱勢社群的一個重點項目，我們希望透過社區客廳的各項設施與服務，為「劏房」家庭提供額外的生活空間——這是最緊要的——還有適切的支援服務，以及地區的共享資源，幫助他們改善生活環境，同時擴闊鄰里網絡，一起建立更美好的社區。就這幾點來說，我覺得我們這間社區客廳完全做得到，剛才我們也聽到有些街坊跟我們說，平時覺得精神很悶、很鬱結，但來這裏後就開心起來，我覺得這正正是我們希望社區客廳做到的事情。特別是有些媽媽平時很忙、對着孩子——我也試過對着孩子——有時若果家裏很小就會越對越惱怒，但空間大些便會好一些，可以出外見見朋友、參加康樂活動。你們（社區客廳）很好，舉辦很多活動、教教他們（街坊）一些事物，我覺得非常好，充分利用了社區客廳的優點。

西營盤社區客廳的選址非常便利，真正做到融入街坊的日常生活，不少服務對象只需要步行幾分鐘——剛才有位街坊跟我說，步行206步就來到這裏——就可以來到這個額外的空間，輕鬆地使用各種設施與服務。無論是來做功課、洗衣服、參加活動，或是簡簡單單地聊聊天，都變得更容易、更平常，而「家常」就是我們最想做到的。

這裏面積約2 000平方呎，預計可以服務230個家庭——剛才主任跟我說，現在已經有百多個登記，應該很快就會滿了——全年接待約三萬七千人次。我希望這裏不只是一個社區客廳，更是大家的另一個「家」，一個可以放鬆休息、遊戲學習、結交朋友、互相扶持的共享空間。

西營盤社區客廳能夠順利誕生和啓用，充分體現了政、商、民三方的齊心努力合作。首先，我要衷心感謝周大福慈善基金有限公司及利希慎基金，他們懷着服務社會的熱誠，以「免租金、免管理費」形式提供場地，並承擔所有裝修費用，讓這個項目得以順利落地。多謝你們！

同時，我亦衷心感謝營運夥伴香港明愛，他們將全年無休——年初一也上班，很多謝你們——為大家提供服務。大家也知道，明愛扎根社區多年，服務經驗非常豐富，而且在中西區推動社區支援項目成效非常卓越，深受街坊信賴。剛才我和街坊聊天時他們很開心，我就知道你們做得很成功。

至於政府，我們的角色是牽頭、協調資源、通過關愛基金支持營運，並促進各方合作，讓項目順利推展。

剛才我參觀了這間社區客廳，並與幾位用戶及工作人員交流，感受很深。接下來，我想用三個「切」字作為「切入點」，分享我對這間社區客廳的觀察與體會。

第一是「適切」。這裏的設施，真正切合「劏房」戶的日常需要——剛才有一位朋友跟我說非常喜歡這裏的洗衣乾衣機，真的十分方便，他說八元便可以使用，跟他平時用開的48元便宜了很多，對他們來說這個收費也是非常能接受到；而共享廚房、飯廳和客廳，讓大家可以一齊煮飯、食飯、閒話家常——我最開心聽到他們說很多時候一起「開幾圍」吃飯，不用自己一、兩個人在家吃那麼悶，多些人一起吃飯會更開心，也有更多話題聊聊；還有自助洗衣機、乾衣機和淋浴間，方便日常生活；亦有哥哥姐姐教小孩子溫習，亦有給小孩子玩耍的遊戲區，這裏最緊要是他們玩遊戲時安安全全，學習亦有哥哥姐姐教導。

第二是「確切」。這裏的服務，我覺得是實事求是、實實在在、精準到位，滿足不同用戶的需要。無論是功課輔導、生活講座，還是申請社區資源，都切實幫助到用戶。

第三是「親切」。剛才我聽到街坊稱讚這裏做得很好，這裏每一位工作人員都「親切」有禮，不單止耐心講解設施，也用心聆聽需求，主動幫忙解決生活困難。無論是新朋友還是老街坊，我都希望他們能感受到這份溫暖與誠意。

西營盤社區客廳是我們第10間社區客廳，亦是今年第一間全新啓用的社區客廳。而其實今年內，我們預計還會陸續開設多五間社區客廳，即是連同今天開幕的西營盤社區客廳，我們今年合共會開設六間社區客廳，比去年全年的五間更多——其實我手上還有些「貨」，不過那些暫時未能公布，現時先說五間。

我衷心希望，每一間社區客廳都能夠成為洋溢歡笑、充滿希望與正能量的地方，讓小朋友有更多玩樂和成長的空間，讓家長有休息和交流的機會，讓整個社區的聯繫更加密切。

最後，祝願西營盤社區客廳運作順利。馬年即將到臨，我亦向大家拜個早年，祝各位街坊身體健康、家庭幸福。多謝大家！"

李副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室九龍工作部副部長李文彬）、楊會長（香港觀塘工商業聯合會永遠榮譽會長楊孫西博士）、陳博士（港區全國人大代表陳振彬博士）、洪議員（立法會議員洪錦鉉）、張議員（立法會議員張培剛）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。今日我很高興來到觀塘裕民坊，出席「龍騰觀塘新春夜市2026」的開幕典禮，與大家一同迎接馬年，感受新春的熱鬧氣氛。

近年觀塘區的「龍騰夜市」深受市民歡迎，已成為區內一項標誌性的社區盛事。回顧過去兩年，主辦單位除舉辦新春夜市外，更於夏季舉辦仲夏夜市，成功延續夜市的熱鬧氣氛，為社區持續增添歡樂。三次夜市共吸引近130萬人次到訪，帶來約1,900萬元的營業額。這些亮眼成績不僅反映活動深得民心，更充分展現夜市在刺激本地消費、促進地區經濟的顯著成效。

根據最新統計數據顯示，十二月的零售業總銷貨價值按年上升6.6%，連續八個月錄得升幅，二○二五年全年亦增長至超過3,800億元，反映本地消費氣氛正逐步回穩，旅客及市民的購買力持續改善。像「龍騰觀塘夜市」這類結合飲食、零售及社區特色的活動，正正為市民提供更多元化的消費選擇，亦為中小企和地區商戶創造實在的生意機會，把整體經濟復甦的活力，成功帶進社區。

今年的新春夜市得到香港北京社團總會及香港文體旅交流協會協辦支持，活動內容比往年更為豐富。剛才我參觀多個攤位，無論是各地特色美食、創意商品，還是應節年花專區，都相當吸引；同時更設有多項兒童遊戲，讓一家大小可以開開心心辦年貨、熱熱鬧鬧迎新歲。

此外，大會更精心安排多場精彩表演，為觀塘區注入更多創意和活力。夜市特設的馬年專屬打卡裝置亦是今年的焦點之一，讓市民在感受節日氣氛的同時，與家人朋友留下美好而難忘的回憶。

政府一直致力推動本地經濟多元發展，透過優化營商環境及支援中小企，鼓勵更多結合社區特色的活動。而「龍騰觀塘夜市」能夠順利舉辦，實在有賴各界的通力合作。在此，我衷心感謝觀塘工商業聯合會多年來悉心策劃，亦感謝各位觀塘區區議員、觀塘民政事務處等政府部門，以及香港北京社團總會、香港文體旅交流協會及市區重建局的支持和配合，帶動區內商圈人流，為地區經濟注入動力。

今年是象徵活力與朝氣的馬年，寓意策馬揚鞭、勇往向前。我深信，只要社會各界同心協力、發揮創意、把握機遇，香港經濟定能如駿馬奔騰，再創高峰。

在此，我預祝「龍騰觀塘新春夜市2026」圓滿成功，祝各位商戶生意興隆，亦希望各位到訪的街坊朋友滿載而歸。我誠邀大家向親朋好友推介這個一連17日的跨年夜市，一同來觀塘感受濃厚的新春氣氛。

最後，我謹祝各位馬到功成、身體健康、萬事如意、新年快樂。多謝大家。"

14名更生青少年日前（二月七日）在佛山展開交流團行程，參觀了三譚革命事蹟展覽館等地方，以了解中國近代歷史，並且與區內一間學校與當地師生交流，以了解當地的學習環境。隨後他們到了當地一家中醫院，以認識中醫藥源遠流長的歷史及醫療體系的發展。及後交流團轉往珠海，於一間通用飛機公司及一間太空中心參與研學活動，分別了解國家的飛機研發、製造與運營服務，以及國家的航天科技成果，並參觀了一間智慧科技公司以了解國家的無人船研發與應用。

參與交流團的青少年阿明（化名）已多年沒有踏足內地。阿明表示，在二○一九年「黑暴」期間，他和他的朋友被報章煽動和誤導，走到街上作出暴力行為，其後要承受法律後果而入獄。在懲教署的更生服務幫助下，阿明希望能改過自新、融入社會，為香港、祖國作出貢獻。

他續說，他以往因被誤導而對內地存有誤解，此行讓他大開眼界。他不僅認識中國歷史文化，更首次乘坐高鐵及參觀科技企業，切身感受到國家發展迅速。他感謝署方的悉心安排，讓他重新認識祖國。

交流團屬署方「沿途有『理』」更生計劃之延伸。交流團對象是曾參與「黑暴」事件的受監管青少年，旨在透過實地走訪、親身觀察，讓參加者學習和了解源遠流長的中國歷史與文化底蘊，見證國家繁榮發展，從而加深對國情與國家發展的理解，並建立對國家的歸屬感及加強國民身分認同。"

 Fourteen young rehabilitated persons began their exchange tour in Foshan on February 7. They first visited the San Tan Geming Shiji Exhibition Hall to learn about modern Chinese history, followed by a visit to a local school to interact with teachers and students, gaining insights into the local learning environment. They then proceeded to a Chinese medicine hospital to understand the long history of Chinese medicine and the development of the healthcare system. Participants subsequently headed to Zhuhai to participate in educational activities at a general aircraft company and a space centre to gain an understanding of national aircraft research and development, aircraft manufacturing and operational services as well as its achievements in aerospace technology. They also visited an intelligent technology company to learn about the nation's research, development and application of unmanned surface vessels.

 A participating youth, Ah Ming (pseudonym), who had not returned to the Chinese Mainland for years, stated that during the ""black-clad violence"" in 2019, he and his friends were incited and misled by newspapers to commit violent acts on the street. He was subsequently sentenced to imprisonment, bearing the legal consequences of his actions. With the help of the Correctional Services Department (CSD)'s rehabilitation services, Ah Ming said he hopes to turn over a new leaf and reintegrate into society, making a contribution to Hong Kong and the homeland.

 Ah Ming added that he previously had misunderstandings about the Chinese Mainland due to being misled. This trip has broadened his horizons significantly, not only allowing him to learn about Chinese history and culture, but also providing an opportunity for him to ride a high-speed train for the first time and visit technology enterprises, so that he could understand in person the rapid development of the country. He appreciated the CSD for the meticulous arrangements, which allowed him to rediscover his homeland.

 The Exchange Tour is an extension of the Department's targeted rehabilitation programme, the Project PATH. Participants include youths under supervision who were involved in the ""black-clad violence"". The tour aims, through visits and observation, to allow participants to learn and understand the profound Chinese history and culture as well as to witness the nation's prosperous development, thereby deepening their understanding of national conditions and development and fostering their sense of belonging to the country and national identity."

Two persons suspected to be connected with the case were arrested.

One female passenger and one male passenger, both aged 19, arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During Customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds inside their baggage. The duo was subsequently arrested.

The two arrested persons have been jointly charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug and will appear at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (February 10).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/en)."

Non-official Members of the Executive Council (ExCo Non-official Members) today (February 9) issued the following statement:

The Court of First Instance of the High Court today passed sentences in the Lai Chee-ying case. ExCo Non-official Members stated that Lai Chee-ying and the other defendants in the case endangered national security and undermined social stability, which are serious offences. The court's convictions and the sentences imposed on the defendants have demonstrated the justice of the law, with the court's judgment based strictly on the law and evidence, free from any interference.

ExCo Non-official Members emphasised that the court had conducted an open and fair trial of the Lai Chee-ying case in accordance with the law. Anyone who violates the law must be held accountable, and any actions endangering national security must be severely punished by the law. No one can escape justice. The court's convictions and the severe sentences imposed on the defendants represent a crucial manifestation of resolutely safeguarding national security, implementing the Hong Kong National Security Law and upholding the rule of law. This is of significant importance in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for acts and activities endangering national security, fully reflecting the steadfast and successful implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" principle.

入境處打擊外傭違反逗留條件拘十四人（附圖）,2026-02-09 17:55,2026-02-09 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900560.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於二月五日至二月九日一連五日在全港各區展開代號「劍魚」的反非法勞工行動。在該項打擊外籍家庭傭工（外傭）在港違反逗留條件的行動中，入境處共拘捕十四名人士，包括七名懷疑非法勞工及七名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。

行動中，入境處人員一共搜查了二十二個目標地點，包括餐廳、零售店舖、美容中心、髮型屋、健身中心、賓館、商業大廈及住宅大廈單位等。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為七名女子，年齡介乎二十二至五十五歲。當中五名為現職外傭、一名為逾期逗留的前外傭以及一名持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）人士。被捕的懷疑非法勞工從事髮型屋助理、銷售、或在合約地址以外的地方從事清潔及家務助理等工作。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工的七名人士分別為兩男五女，年齡介乎三十九至六十九歲，他們均為涉案公司和餐廳的東主或負責人等。調查人員亦於行動中檢獲一張偽造的香港身份證副本。有關案件仍在調查中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「外傭只能根據合約附錄的「住宿及家務安排」為僱主料理家務。外傭不得受僱於其他人士擔任任何職務，包括兼職家務工作。僱主亦不得要求或容許傭工為其他人士擔任任何工作。」

入境處發言人強調：「任何人違反對他／她有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

此外，入境處發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰會由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外傭）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口及／或強迫勞動指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口及／或強迫勞動的元素。被識別的販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

Hong Kong Customs detects case of suspected smuggling of illicit fuel (with photos),2026-02-09 17:55,2026-02-09 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900488.htm,"Hong Kong Customs on February 6 detected an illicit fuel smuggling case involving a cross-boundary lorry at the Shenzhen Bay Control Point and found a suspected altered structure inside the fuel tanks of the tractor of the lorry. Approximately 1 320 litres of unmanifested motor spirit were seized along with the arrest of a 66-year-old male driver. The tractor of the lorry was also detained.

The arrestee is suspected of smuggling illicit fuel and violating the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO), the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Dangerous Goods Ordinance.

Customs reminds cross-boundary goods vehicle drivers not to engage in any smuggling activities. Under the IEO, any vehicle found to have the fittings, fabric or structure altered and used for smuggling purposes may be subject to forfeiture.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the IEO, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

In addition, under the DCO, anyone involved in importing, dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit motor spirit commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
Immigration Department arrested 14 persons during operations targeting foreign domestic helpers who breached conditions of stay (with photos),2026-02-09 17:55,2026-02-09 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900590.htm,"The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Swordfish"" for five consecutive days from February 5 to 9, targeting foreign domestic helpers who breached their conditions of stay. A total of 14 persons, including seven suspected illegal workers and seven suspected employers, were arrested.

During the operations, ImmD investigators raided 22 target locations, including restaurants, retail shops, beauty centres, hair salons, fitness centres, guesthouses, commercial buildings and residential building units. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised seven women, aged 22 to 55. Among them, five persons were current helpers, one person was an overstaying ex-helper, and one person was a holder of recognizance form, which prohibits her from taking any employment in Hong Kong. The suspected illegal workers were performing as salon assistants or sales or taking up cleaning duties and household work at places other than their contractual address. Meanwhile, seven suspected employers, comprising two men and five women aged 39 to 69, were owners or persons-in-charge of the companies and restaurants involved. A copy of a forged Hong Kong identity card was also found during the operation. Relevant cases are still under investigation, and the ImmD does not rule out the possibility of further arrests.

""A helper should only perform domestic duties for the employer as listed in the 'Schedule of Accommodation and Domestic Duties' attached to the Contract. The helper should not take up any other employment, including part-time domestic duties, with any other person. The employer should not require or allow the helper to carry out any work for any other person,"" an ImmD spokesman said.

The spokesman also said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him/her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

The spokesman warned that, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged identity card or an identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) and/or forced labour victims. When any TIP and/or forced labour indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP and/or forced labour elements. Identified TIP and/or forced labour victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter, temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP and/or forced labour victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."
民政及青年事務局局長在立法會民政及文化體育事務委員會會議的開場發言（只有中文）,2026-02-09 17:52,2026-02-09 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900602.htm,"以下是民政及青年事務局（民青局）局長麥美娟今日（二月九日）在立法會民政及文化體育事務委員會會議的開場發言：

主席、各位委員：

我和民政事務總署（民政總署）的同事今日出席委員會會議，向委員匯報政府在深化改革大廈管理方面的工作，包括《建築物管理條例》（第344章）（《建管條例》）的進一步修訂方向，徵詢委員的意見；以及就民政總署一個將在二○二六年四月一日撤銷的首長級丙級政務官有時限編外職位，職銜為民政總署助理署長（5），轉為常額職位的建議，希望得到委員的支持。

政府近年推動大廈管理的工作

本屆政府非常重視大廈管理的工作，致力在大廈管理方面展現更積極及主動有為的角色，致力推動相關改革及發展，更到位地協助業主處理大廈管理相關事宜，並提升整體工作效能。

民青局於二○二四年成立內部高層小組，督導處理複雜的大廈管理個案，亦於同年完成《建管條例》的修訂，《2024年建築物管理（修訂）條例》（《修訂條例》）已於二○二五年七月生效。民政總署自二○二五年六月已在油尖旺、深水埗、九龍城、荃灣四區試行「聯廈聯管」，同時持續提供多元化的支援服務，協助業主履行管理大廈的責任。為完善地區處理大廈管理的設置，18區區議會已於今年一月成立大廈管理工作小組，並已舉行首次會議。同時，物業管理業監管局繼續推動物業管理（物管）業界專業化發展，與業主攜手做好大廈管理。

進一步修訂《建管條例》

政府在立法會通過《修訂條例》時已表示會繼續跟進大廈管理的不同議題。行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》亦提出，政府將開展下一階段有關《建管條例》的檢視工作。因應社會對大廈管理的關注，作為深化改革工作的重要一部分，我們已經初步擬定五個修訂方向，包括（1）針對大型維修工程及大額採購的相關會議，提高法定人數及投票門檻；（2）提升處理委任代表文書的透明度，包括研究設立持有文書上限，以及張貼已簽委任文書的單位業主名單等；（3）完善利益申報制度，要求工程顧問與承辦商披露彼此之間的關係；（4）在條例更清晰規定業主大會的召開、議程、取消、延期或暫停等安排；以及（5）就指定情況賦予主管當局更多權力。

政府會就上述擬修訂內容諮詢物管業界、法團及業主，亦會透過區議會轄下大廈管理工作小組收集地區意見，務求盡快敲定具體立法建議。

建議民政總署一個首長級有時限職位轉為常額職位

財委會於二○二三年六月批准開設助理署長（5）有時限職位（首長級丙級政務官），為期至二○二六年三月三十一日。期內，助理署長（5）承擔的剛才提及的各項重要職能，包括統籌《建管條例》的修訂與推廣、支援高層小組處理複雜大廈管理個案、推行「聯廈聯管」、加強物管業界的角色等。

鑑於政府需要持續深化與大廈管理相關的改革工作，為確保各項重要政策職能可以持續推進，並得到充分的首長級領導及監督，我們建議將民政總署助理署長（5）有時限職位轉為常額職位。

歡迎議員稍後就此建議發問和提出意見，並給予支持。如上述將有時限職位轉為常額職位的建議獲委員同意，我們預計會在二○二六年三月把建議提交立法會人事編制小組委員會審議。

現在，我先邀請民政總署助理署長李嘉淵女士就《建管條例》的建議修訂詳情向大家作簡報。多謝主席。"

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-09 17:30,2026-02-09 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900531.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 9), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
大灣區藝術展覽系列「水墨異重奏」—「形神之辯」在佛山舉行（附圖）,2026-02-09 16:45,2026-02-09 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900280.htm,"康樂及文化事務署（康文署）轄下藝術推廣辦事處，與深圳市前沿藝穗藝術中心共同籌劃大灣區藝術展覽系列「水墨異重奏」，第四場展覽「形神之辯」，由即日起至三月二十八日在佛山舉行。展覽聚焦中國傳統哲學與美學中的「形」與「神」的辯證關係，香港藝術家吳觀麟以千變萬化的水墨石景，江門藝術家區廷柱則以凝練的漆立體藝術，展現大灣區藝術家在傳統與創新之間的創造力和互動。

吳觀麟展出的作品融合不同媒體，包含現代水墨作品、塑膠彩及攝影。他的水墨作品《石夢》系列講述了石頭在做夢的故事，也是藝術家對人生每個階段的思考。《臥遊》系列則打破了山水畫以紙墨為媒介的傳統，改用畫布和塑膠彩來表現山川流水的形貌和神韻。影像作品《踰越》系列展示藝術家將不同時期的繪畫及攝影創作並置，一部分呈現建築工地水泥塊富有張力的攝影照片，另一部分以流淌的筆墨顯現水泥塊內在的生命力。

區廷柱創作的漆立體藝術探討存在與消逝、形體與精神的關係。藝術家在《山水》系列延續唐宋文人對山水的情感，以山、水、池、光等自然元素為切入點，將山水永恆的精神從宣紙中剝離，再植入當代視覺經驗的碎片之中。《紀念碑》系列以乾漆夾苧技法製作，每道工序的痕跡，都會因下一層的覆蓋而逐漸淡化，最終在作品完成時近乎消隱。

展覽並展出兩位藝術家共同創作的裝置作品《存有論》。他們以弈棋為喻，各自設計半套棋盤及棋子，最終合而為一。吳觀麟製作的棋子取材自都市建造所殘餘的水泥塊、玻璃工坊遷移留下的玻璃剩料等；區廷柱創作的棋子選用大小不一的竹節形態漆器物，形態圓融、溫潤可觸。共創的棋局既保有獨自的藝術特色，又顯現兩種風格的互相交融。

展覽於佛山市南海區西樵鎮錦湖大道10號西樵山美術館（有為館）舉行，免費入場。展覽詳情，可瀏覽藝術推廣辦事處網頁www.apo.hk/tc/web/apo/there_ink_art_ensembles_debate_on_form_and_spirit.html，和追蹤「距地藝術」Facebook專頁www.facebook.com/apo.there、Instagram專頁www.instagram.com/apo.there及微博專頁weibo.com/apothere。

"""Ink Art Ensembles"" Exhibition Series in the Greater Bay Area - ""Debate on Form and Spirit"" staged in Foshan (with photos)",2026-02-09 16:45,2026-02-09 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900281.htm,"  Jointly organised by the Art Promotion Office under the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) and the Shenzhen Fringe Art Center, the fourth exhibition ""Debate on Form and Spirit"" of the ""Ink Art Ensembles"" Exhibition Series in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) is on display until March 28 in Foshan. The exhibition focuses on exploring the dialectical relationship between ""form"" and ""spirit"" in traditional Chinese philosophy and aesthetics. Hong Kong artist Tony Ng's ever-changing ink stone landscapes, together with Jiangmen artist Ou Tingzhu's refined lacquer art sculptures, showcase creativity and interaction of tradition and innovation among GBA artists.

 Ng's artwork at the exhibition integrates different media, including contemporary ink painting, acrylics, and photography. His ink art ""A Stone's Dream"" series narrates the dreams of a stone, and unfolds the artist's reflections on each stage of life. In the ""Transcending Nature"" series, Ng breaks from the tradition of using ink and paper in Chinese landscape painting, instead employing acrylics and canvas to capture the forms and spirit of mountains and rivers. The photography series ""Transcend"" shows the artist juxtaposing paintings and photographic artworks from different periods, with one part featuring cement blocks collected from construction sites to create dynamic photographs, while another part reveals their inherent vitality through flowing brushwork.

 Ou's lacquer art creation explores the relationship between presence and disappearance, and between form and spirit. In the ""Shanshui"" series, the artist continues the emotional connection to mountains and water of the literati in the Tang and Song dynasties. Using elements such as mountains, water, pools and light as a starting point, he extracts the spirituality of the landscape from paper, embedding it into the fragmented visual experience of contemporary life. The ""Monument"" series was created using the traditional dry lacquer technique. The trace of each step is gradually covered and softened by the following layer, making it nearly invisible in the finished work.

 The exhibition also displays an art installation, ""Ontology"", collaboratively created by the two artists. Using chess as a metaphor, each artist designed half of the chessboard and chess pieces, ultimately merging them into a cohesive whole. The chess pieces Ng created are the items collected from urban construction cement blocks, leftover glass from a glass workshop, and so on. Ou's chess pieces take the form of a series of lacquered bamboo‑segment vessels in varying sizes, which are rounded, warm and tactile. This collaborative chess game showcases their individual artistic identities while harmoniously blending both styles.

 The exhibition is running at Xiqiao Mountain Art Museum (Youwei Art Museum), No. 10 Jinhu Avenue, Xiqiao Town, Nanhai District, Foshan. Admission is free. For details of the exhibition, please visit the website of the Art Promotion Office www.apo.hk/en/web/apo/there_ink_art_ensembles_debate_on_form_and_spirit.html, and follow the ""apothere"" page on Facebook www.facebook.com/apo.there, Instagram www.instagram.com/apo.there and Weibo weibo.com/apothere.

 The exhibition is also one of the activities in the Chinese Culture Promotion Series. The LCSD has long been promoting Chinese history and culture through organising an array of programmes and activities to enable the public to learn more about the broad and profound Chinese culture.

Justice upheld in Court of First Instance's sentence regarding Lai Chee-ying case,2026-02-09 15:03,2026-02-09 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900400.htm,"The Court of First Instance of the High Court today (February 9) handed down sentences for Lai Chee-ying and the other eight defendants, as well as three companies relating to Apple Daily in respect of their convictions of a total of three charges of offences endangering national security. The total sentence for Lai Chee-ying was imprisonment for 20 years. As for the other eight defendants, their imprisonment terms ranged from six years and three months to 10 years. The three companies relating to Apple Daily were each sentenced to a fine of HK$3,004,500.

The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, said, ""Lai Chee-ying has committed numerous heinous crimes, and his evil deeds were beyond measure. The severe sentence of 20 years' imprisonment imposed on him manifests that the rule of law is upheld and justice is done, and also brings great relief to all. Lai Chee-ying had long used Apple Daily to poison the minds of our citizens, by inciting hatred, distorting facts, deliberately stirring up social antagonism and glorifying violence. He had openly begged for external forces to impose sanctions against China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), sacrificing the well-being of the people of China and the HKSAR. He betrayed our country and harmed Hong Kong, causing damage to the interests of our country and the HKSAR. His conviction is supported by overwhelming evidence, and he for sure deserves his punishment after all the harm he has done.

  ""Lai Chee-ying's malicious acts endangering national security have harmed the interests of our country and the HKSAR, as well as the interests of our citizens. The court, after 156 days of fair and impartial public hearings and having considered the irrefutable evidence of up to 2 220 exhibits, over 80 000 pages of documents and statements of evidence from 14 prosecution witnesses, concluded that Lai Chee-ying was the mastermind behind those anti-China and destabilising activities. His acts are despicable and shameless.

  ""The conviction of the heinous crimes committed by Lai Chee-ying was the first convicted case of the offence of 'collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security' since the promulgation and implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL). This marks an important milestone in the HKSAR's efforts to safeguard national security, manifesting the role of the HKNSL as a key stabilising force. This case also admonishes that villains who endanger national security could never escape the sanctions of the law and would surely be severely punished in accordance with the law. The HKSAR will continue to steadfastly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.

  ""The court has already handed down severe sentences for Lai Chee-ying and the other defendants in accordance with the law, manifesting that the rule of law is upheld and justice is done. That said, Hong Kong as a whole has already paid a heavy price. Poisoned by Lai Chee-ying, and Apple Daily under his control, some of our citizens, especially young people, have been misled to break the law and become radical and violent. During the period of 'blackclad violence', they committed acts of vandalism on public facilities. Not only did they storm the Legislative Council and government buildings, throw petrol bombs, and commit arson, but some even set people on fire. Furthermore, some young people smuggled real guns, made bombs, and plotted terrorist activities. It was fortunate that the Police had taken prompt enforcement actions to crack down on these plots, thus preventing mass casualties. However, many young people who had been incited to commit those crimes eventually ended up in prison. In fact, as of the end of last year, more than 2 400 individuals have been held accountable for unlawful acts during the period of 'black-clad violence'. It is plain to see that the evil deeds committed by Lai Chee-ying and his syndicate were beyond measure.""

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""The court pointed out clearly in its verdict handed down earlier that Lai Chee-ying was the mastermind of the case. He had manipulated and exploited Apple Daily to poison society, and repeatedly colluded with external forces to beg for sanctions and hostile activities against the Central Authorities and the HKSAR Government. Lai Chee-ying's malicious plot spanned across both the periods before and after the promulgation of the HKNSL. His intent was to collude with external forces to harm the interests of China and the HKSAR, as well as those of our citizens. He also shamelessly acted as a pawn of external forces to endanger national security.

  ""After hearing the submissions of the defendants on sentencing in the hearings of January 12 and 13, the court provided a detailed account of its considerations in every respect in its reasons for the sentence handed down today. The court held that the offence of 'conspiracy to print, publish, sell, offer for sale, distribute, display and/or reproduce seditious publications' in this case fell within the most serious category for its type, and the two offences of 'conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security' fell within the category of offences of 'a grave nature'.

  ""As the court pointed out in the reasons for the sentence, these offences took place at a time when Hong Kong had hardly recovered from the social turmoil caused by the 'Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement'. The conspiracies were meticulously planned, involved multiple parties, and were clearly premeditated. The conspiracies involved the use of online platforms and a large number of seditious articles, targeting both local and overseas audiences, and some criminal activities were even conducted outside the HKSAR. The conspiracies were persistent ones, resulting in many acts rather than a single incident. After the enactment of the HKNSL, even though Lai Chee-ying's requests for foreign countries to impose sanctions or blockades, or engage in other hostile activities became more implicit and subtle, the change was only in form rather than in substance, with all the defendants continuing with their agreement for some time until after they were arrested by the Police. In fact, the sanctions imposed by foreign countries against the HKSAR, as well as against officials of China and the HKSAR have not been removed even up to today. It is wholly unrealistic to say that Lai Chee-ying and others' activities were not a contributing cause. The court unequivocally identified Lai Chee-ying as the mastermind and the driving force behind these conspiracies, which constituted an aggravating factor and therefore enhanced the starting point for his sentence.

  ""The Government would forfeit the offence-related property of Lai Chee-ying in accordance with the law. The Secretary for Security has earlier frozen the offence-related property of Lai Chee-ying and of the companies relating to Apple Daily in accordance with the Implementation Rules for Article 43 of the HKNSL. Article 31 of the HKNSL stipulates that the operation of a company or an organisation shall be suspended or its licence or business permit shall be revoked if it has been punished for committing an offence under the HKNSL. The HKSAR Government will initiate the procedures pursuant to section 360C of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32) so as to have the three companies relating to Apple Daily struck off the Companies Register to safeguard national security.""

The spokesman said, ""Since the HKSAR Government has taken action in accordance with the law to combat the illegal acts of Lai Chee-ying endangering national security, many Western countries, overseas anti-China media, organisations and politicians have been continuously smearing the efforts of the HKSAR in safeguarding national security. These countries themselves frequently deploy the tactics of overstretching the concept of national security as a pretext to suppress their own opponents. Moreover, they have been harbouring their agents by constantly slandering Hong Kong, hypocritically cloaking Lai Chee-ying in the false guise of a 'media mogul', and even fabricating health problems of Lai Chee-ying during the trial.

  ""These schemes all crumbled during the fair and impartial public hearings in court. The 855-page verdict handed down by the court provided irrefutable proof and demonstrated the court's fair judgment based strictly on the law and evidence.""

The spokesman further said, ""The Correctional Services Department (CSD) has been ensuring that the custodial environment for persons-in-custody (PICs) is safe, humane, appropriate and healthy in accordance with the law. These include adequate lighting and good ventilation, as well as appropriate and timely medical support. During the plea in mitigation in court on January 13 this year, the senior counsel representing Lai Chee-ying confirmed repeatedly that Lai Chee-ying had made no complaints about the treatment he received while in custody. The court also confirmed in its reasons for sentence that the CSD has been providing adequate medical attention for Lai Chee-ying.

  ""As regards the arrangement of removing Lai Chee-ying from association with other PICs, it has long been made based on his own request by the CSD after considering all relevant factors in accordance with the law. Lai Chee-ying's entitlements in prison, including visitation, communication, welfare and religious services, as well as outdoor exercise arrangements, have not been deprived of on account of his personal status or his removal from association with other PICs.

  ""The HKSAR Government has completed the local legislation on Article 23 of the Basic Law by enacting the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO). The HKNSL and the SNSO are compatible with and complementary to each other, jointly establishing the legal system for safeguarding national security. The HKSAR will continue to resolutely discharge its duty of safeguarding national security, while protecting the legitimate rights and interests of Hong Kong citizens, fulfilling its inherent responsibility, and making every effort to prevent, suppress and punish acts and activities that endanger national security."""
