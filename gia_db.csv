Grading of beach water quality released,2025-12-24 16:00,2025-12-24 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400489.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (December 24) released the latest grading of water quality for six gazetted beaches that are open all year round for swimming.

  Four beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1), and two as Fair (Grade 2).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Golden Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Silverstrand Beach




Grade 2 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Lido Beach




  Compared with the grading released last week, there was no change in the grading for these beaches.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast)."

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on December 23 to noon today (December 24), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 281 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

Office of Licensing Authority of Home Affairs Department stepped up enforcement actions against unlicensed hotels/guesthouses and illegal club-house operations before festive season (with photo),2025-12-24 15:00,2025-12-24 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400288.htm,"âBefore the festive season holidays, the Office of the Licensing Authority (OLA) of the Home Affairs Department conducted an operation codenamed ""Solar Flare"" against premises suspected of operating unlicensed hotels or guesthouses and licensed club-houses suspected of being in breach of licensing conditions in Yau Tsim Mong District, Wan Chai District and Central and Western District for five consecutive days from December 15 to 19, to ensure the safety of customers as well as the general public.

A spokesman for the OLA said, ""During the operation, the OLA carried out surprise inspections of 48 premises. Six premises were suspected of operating unlicensed hotels or guesthouses, and two licensed club-houses were suspected of breaching certain licensing conditions. The OLA will initiate prosecution on cases with sufficient evidence after completion of the investigation.""

The spokesman stressed, ""Operating unlicensed hotels or guesthouses is a criminal offence leading to a criminal record upon conviction. According to the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance, an offender is liable to three years' imprisonment and a maximum fine of $500,000. A fine of $20,000 for each day can also be imposed during which the offence continues. A six-month closure order may also be issued for a hotel/guesthouse involved in a repeated offence. Moreover, according to the Clubs (Safety of Premises) Ordinance, an offender who contravenes any condition of a certificate of compliance (e.g. failure to produce a fire certificate on demand and carrying out alteration and addition works without seeking prior approval) is liable to a maximum fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment. A fine of $10,000 for each day can also be imposed during which the offence continues.""

  To enhance deterrence against unlicensed hotels and guesthouses, the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance was amended in 2020 to empower the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Authority to apply to the court, upon the second conviction within 16 months of operating an unlicensed hotel or guesthouse or the new strict liability offence in respect of the same premises, to issue a closure order to close the premises for six months. As at December 15, the OLA has applied for four closure orders under the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance from the court, of which two closure orders against two premises have been issued by the court.

  Apart from conducting special operations during festive seasons, the OLA is also stepping up efforts to combat unlicensed guesthouses via online platforms. The OLA has strengthened its intelligence collection by forming a dedicated team to browse webpages, mobile applications, social media, discussion forums, etc., to search for information and intelligence on suspected unlicensed guesthouses. The OLA's law enforcement officers will initiate follow-up investigations when information on unlicensed guesthousesadvertised via online platforms is found. The OLA also conducts publicity work on major Internet search engines outside Hong Kong toenable tourists to access information provided by the OLA in the course of planning their trips to Hong Kong.

財庫局和證監會就規管虛擬資產交易及託管服務的立法建議發表諮詢總結,2025-12-24 14:45,2025-12-24 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400262.htm,"財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）和證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）今日（十二月二十四日）就設立虛擬資產交易及託管服務提供者發牌制度的立法建議，聯合發表諮詢總結。財庫局及證監會今日同時就另外設立就虛擬資產提供意見的服務提供者及虛擬資產管理服務提供者的發牌制度，展開進一步公眾諮詢，為期一個月。

為期兩個月的公眾諮詢在今年八月完成，其間就虛擬資產交易服務提供者和虛擬資產託管服務提供者的擬議發牌制度分別收到101份和93份意見書，來自市場參與者、行業組織、商會和專業團體等。大部分回應者均明確表示，支持在虛擬資產交易平台發牌制度於二○二三年六月實施後擴展監管範圍，將虛擬資產交易和託管服務納入其中。他們認為這是促進香港數字資產（註）生態圈穩健及可持續發展的關鍵一步。此外，回應者普遍支持擬議的監管要求及實施安排的整體方向，同時在某些方面提出優化建議及尋求釐清。

擬議的虛擬資產交易服務提供者發牌制度，將與《證券及期貨條例》（第571章）下適用於傳統證券交易活動的第1類（證券交易）受規管活動的制度基本一致。至於就虛擬資產託管服務提供者，擬議的發牌制度將會聚焦於管理與在香港保管客戶虛擬資產私鑰相關的風險，以應對虛擬資產託管的核心風險，加強客戶資產安全。

財庫局局長許正宇表示：「我們提出就虛擬資產交易和託管服務提供者建立發牌制度是完善數字資產法律框架的重要一步。建議的發牌制度在促進巿場發展、管理風險及保障投資者之間穩慎地取得平衡，有助實現我們構建值得信賴及可持續數字資產生態圈的願景，從而打造香港為數字資產創新的全球中心。」

證監會行政總裁梁鳳儀表示：「我們在建立虛擬資產監管框架方面可謂取得重大進展，透過構建可信、具競爭力及可持續的生態圈，確保香港在數字資產市場發展中繼續處於全球領先地位。而我們對負責任創新抱有堅定不移的承諾，正為一個活力和韌性兼備的生態圈奠下基礎，對香港金融市場及整體經濟的長遠發展將大有裨益。」

與此同時，因應諮詢所得的意見，財庫局與證監會今日就另外設立就虛擬資產提供意見的服務提供者及虛擬資產管理服務提供者的發牌制度展開進一步公眾諮詢。原先建議將相關虛擬資產活動納入虛擬資產交易服務提供者的發牌制度之下。經修訂的監管方案將有別於原先的建議，而是以傳統證券市場上同類服務的監管制度為藍本，將能為市場參與者釐清不同虛擬資產發牌制度下受監管活動的涵蓋範圍。進一步諮詢為期一個月，至二○二六年一月二十三日為止。

財庫局和證監會歡迎公眾就擬議的就虛擬資產提供意見的服務提供者及虛擬資產管理服務提供者發牌制度提供意見，並透過郵遞（香港添馬添美道2號政府總部24樓）或電郵（vadealing-consult@fstb.gov.hk）方式將意見送交財庫局。

諮詢總結的詳情，以及有關就虛擬資產提供意見的服務提供者及虛擬資產管理服務發牌制度的進一步公眾諮詢的細節，已上載至財庫局和證監會的網頁︰

在市場廣泛支持下，並在考慮進一步諮詢所收集到的意見後，財庫局和證監會將敲定發牌制度的立法建議，目標於二○二六年向立法會提交相關條例草案。

FSTB and SFC publish consultation conclusions on legislative proposals for regulating virtual asset dealing and custodian services,2025-12-24 14:45,2025-12-24 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400265.htm,"The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today (December 24) jointly published the consultation conclusions on the legislative proposals for establishing licensing regimes for virtual asset (VA) dealing and custodian service providers. The FSTB and the SFC also launched a further public consultation today for one month on establishing separate licensing regimes for VA advisory and management service providers.

During the two-month public consultation period completed this August, 101 and 93 submissions were received on the proposed licensing regimes for VA dealing service providers and VA custodian service providers respectively. The majority of respondents, including market participants, industry associations, business and professional organisations, expressed clear support for expanding the regulatory scope to cover VA dealing and custodian services, following the introduction of the licensing regime for the VA trading platform in June 2023. This is considered a critical step to promote the steady and sustainable development of the digital asset (Note) ecosystem in Hong Kong. The respondents also indicated support for the overall direction of the proposed regulatory requirements and implementation arrangements, while suggesting enhancements and seeking clarifications on certain aspects.

The proposed licensing regime for VA dealing service providers will largely align with that for Type 1 (dealing in securities) regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571) as applicable to conventional securities dealing activities. As for VA custodian service providers, the proposed licensing regime will focus on managing risks relating to safekeeping private keys of client VAs in Hong Kong, which is the core risk area of VA custody, with a view to enhancing the security of client assets.

The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said, ""The proposed establishment of licensing regimes for VA dealing and custodian service providers marks a significant step in enhancing our legal framework for digital assets. The proposed licensing regimes strike a prudent balance among fostering market development, managing risks and protecting investors. They will help realise our vision for building a trusted and sustainable digital asset ecosystem, with a view to establishing Hong Kong as a global hub for digital asset innovation.""

The Chief Executive Officer of the SFC, Ms Julia Leung, said, ""The significant progress in our VA regulatory framework ensures Hong Kong remains at the global forefront of digital asset market developments by fostering a trusted, competitive and sustainable ecosystem. With an unwavering commitment to responsible innovation, we are laying the foundation for a vibrant yet resilient ecosystem that may bring vast benefits to Hong Kong's financial markets and the broader economy in the long run.""

Meanwhile, in response to the feedback received, the FSTB and the SFC also launched a further publicconsultation today on establishing separate licensing regimes for VA advisory and management service providers, instead of covering the relevant VA activities under the licensing regime for VA dealing service providers as originally proposed. This revised regulatory approach will model itself on the regulatory framework applicable to the conventional securities market, and will provide better clarity as regards the scope of activities regulated under different VA licensing regimes. The further consultation will last for one month, ending on January 23, 2026.

The FSTB and the SFC welcome views from the public on the proposed licensing regimes for VA advisory and management service providers. Submissions should be sent by post (24/F, Central Government Offices, 2 Tim Mei Avenue, Tamar, Hong Kong) or by email (vadealing-consult@fstb.gov.hk) to the FSTB.

Details of the consultation conclusions, as well as the further public consultation for licensing regimes for VA advisory and management service providers, are available on the webpages of the FSTB and the SFC:

*Consultation Conclusions on Legislative Proposal to Regulate Dealing in VA and Further Public Consultation on Legislative Proposal to Regulate VA Advisory Service Providers and VA Management Service Providers (www.fstb.gov.hk/fsb/en/publication/consult/doc/VAdealing_consultation_conclusion_e.pdf /apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/consultation/conclusion?refNo=25CP6)

With broad market support, and taking into account the feedback to be received in the further consultation, the FSTB and the SFC will finalise the legislative proposals for the licensing regimes, with a target of introducing the relevant bill into the Legislative Council in 2026.

Approval to Metro Broadcast Corporation Limited for its change of transmission plan,2025-12-24 12:00,2025-12-24 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400215.htm,"  The Communications Authority (CA), pursuant to Conditions 2.1 and 2.2 of the Schedule to the sound broadcasting licence of Metro Broadcast Corporation Limited (Metro), has approved Metro's application to cease using the fill-in station at Stanley (Stanley Fill-in Station) for transmission of its FM (Note 1) sound broadcasting service with effect from December 31, 2025.

 As stipulated under the sound broadcasting licence of Metro, Metro is currently providing two FM sound broadcasting channels, viz. Metro Info and Metro Finance, through seven main transmitting stations(Note 2), supplemented by the Stanley Fill-in Station to improve the FM reception at Red Hill Peninsula. Metro informed that the Stanley Fill-in Station will cease operation with effect from December 31, 2025, due to the expiry of the tenancy agreement for the premises. Metro submitted that the areas currently served by the Stanley Fill-in Station as an additional source of radio signals can be covered by the radio signals from the two main transmitting stations at Mount Gough and Lamma Island, after the Stanley Fill-in Station ceases to operate.

 In approving Metro's application, the CA notes that the Stanley Fill-in Station is not the only source for Metro to provide its FM sound broadcasting channels to the relevant areas. Based on the reception measurements submitted by Metro and assessed by the CA, satisfactory audio quality is available for public reception of Metro Channels through the two principal Mount Gough and Lamma Island Transmitting Stations. In fact, these two transmitting stations have been deployed by all other sound broadcasters for transmitting their FM sound broadcasting channels(Note 3) for public reception in the areas concerned without fill-in station facilities. For the reasons above, the CA considers that the impact of the changes to Metro's transmission plan to the general public should be minimal and is satisfied that Metro will be able to comply with the coverage requirement stipulated under its sound broadcasting licence.

 Members of the public may call Metro's hotline at 3698 8000 or contact the Office of the Communications Authority at 2961 6333 for enquiries about the reception of the two FM sound broadcasting channels of Metro.

Note 1: In Hong Kong, radio broadcasters use frequency modulation (FM) and amplitude modulation (AM) to provide their sound broadcasting services.
Note 2:The seven transmitting stations are located at Mount Gough, Cloudy Hill, Castle Peak, Golden Hill, Lamma Island, Beacon Hill and Kowloon Peak.
Note 3: They are CR 1 and CR 2 of Hong Kong Commercial Broadcasting Company Limited, and Radio Television Hong Kong's Radio 1, Radio 2, Radio 4 and the channel relaying Radio the Greater Bay of the China Media Group."

批准新城廣播有限公司更改其傳送計劃,2025-12-24 12:00,2025-12-24 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400230.htm,"通訊事務管理局（通訊局）根據新城廣播有限公司（新城電台）的聲音廣播牌照附表第2.1及2.2條，批准新城電台終止使用位於赤柱的補點站（赤柱補點站）以傳送其調頻（FM）（註一）聲音廣播服務，上述改動於二○二五年十二月三十一日起生效。

新城電台的聲音廣播牌照訂明，新城電台目前透過七個主要發射站（註二）提供兩條FM聲音廣播頻道，即新城知訊台及新城財經台，並輔以赤柱補點站，以改善紅山半島的FM接收效果。新城電台表示，由於赤柱補點站所在的處所的租賃協議屆滿，該補點站將於二○二五年十二月三十一日起停止運作。新城電台表示赤柱補點站停止運作後，目前由該補點站作為額外無線電訊號源所覆蓋的地區，可由位於歌賦山和南丫島的兩個主要發射站的訊號所覆蓋。

就批准新城電台的申請，通訊局知悉赤柱補點站並非新城電台向相關地區提供其FM聲音廣播頻道的唯一訊號來源。根據新城電台提交並經通訊局評核的接收測量結果，公眾可透過歌賦山發射站及南丫島發射站收聽新城電台頻道，音質令人滿意。事實上，所有其他聲音廣播機構均利用此兩個發射站，傳送其FM聲音廣播頻道（註三）​至有關地區讓公眾接收，而無需設置補點站設施。基於上述理由，通訊局認為新城電台更改其傳送計劃對公眾影響甚微，並信納新城電台能夠遵守其聲音廣播牌照所載的覆蓋要求。

市民如對新城電台兩條FM聲音廣播頻道的接收事宜有任何查詢，可致電新城電台熱線（電話：3698 8000），或與通訊事務管理局辦公室聯絡（電話：2961 6333）。

Interest rate for Tax Reserve Certificates adjusted,2025-12-24 11:00,2025-12-24 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122300578.htm,"The Inland Revenue Department announced today (December 24) that starting from January 5, 2026, the new annual rate of interest payable on Tax Reserve Certificates will be 0.2417 per cent against the current rate of 0.2583 per cent, i.e. the new rate will be $0.0201 per month per $100.

Tax Reserve Certificates bear simple interest, and interest is calculated monthly (including part of a month) from the date of purchase to the date of payment of tax. Interest is only credited when certificates are used to pay tax, and no interest is due where the principal value of a certificate is repaid to its holder.

The rate of interest payable on Tax Reserve Certificates is reviewed every month based on the average prevailing interest rate for the 12-month time deposit for $100,000 to $499,999 offered by the three note-issuing banks.

The new rate will apply to all certificates purchased on or after January 5, 2026. Certificates purchased before January 5, 2026, will continue to earn interest at the rates prevailing on their respective purchase dates. Below is a summary of the interest rates for the past periods:




For certificates purchased on or after
			October 7, 2024, and before November 4, 2024:

Together with the first four rounds of applications, the GTF has so far approved 39 projects, involving a total grant of around $171 million.

   129 applications were received in the fifth round of applications from December 2024 to March 2025. The six research and development (R&D) projects approved in this round of applications cover promoting hydrogen energy technology, turning waste into resources and developing coating technology for non-plastic products. They are:


Hydrogen energy technology: Development of low-cost proton exchange membrane water electrolysers for producing green hydrogen; development of highly efficient and durable anion exchange membrane water electrolysers to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen; utilisation of active-flow membraneless electrolyser for direct seawater electrolysis for producing green hydrogen;




Turning waste into resources: Development of an innovative sludge treatment system and utilising the waste generated in the treatment process, for the purpose of enhancingsludge treatment efficiency in sewage treatment works; utilisation of acoustic metamaterials made from recycled plastics in soundproofing and noise mitigation systems for data centres; and




Non-plastic products: Development of innovative waterborne coating to enhance the barrier properties of the existing plant-based non-plastic tableware to water, heat and oil.


 The six approved R&D projects are listed in the Annex. Relevant details are published on the GTF webpage (www.gtf.gov.hk/en/project_information/approved_projects.html). These projects will help promote R&D as well as the application of green technologies in different areas, thereby expediting low-carbon transformation and helping Hong Kong strive towards carbon neutrality.

 The GTF Secretariat announced on December 1 that the GTF would be open for the sixth round of applications from December 1, 2025, to February 13, 2026. R&D projects that fall into four areas, namely net-zero electricity generation, energy saving and green buildings, green transport, and waste reduction, will be accorded priority. The GTF welcomes applications from local public research institutions and R&D centres, as well as local private companies to develop low-carbon and green technologies that cater for the needs of Hong Kong's environment and market. The GTF Secretariat will hold a webinar on January 15, 2026, to introduce the application procedures and priority themes of the GTF. Details about applying for the GTF are available on the GTF website (www.gtf.gov.hk)."
Government launches open tender for next tenancy for Kai Tak Cruise Terminal,2025-12-24 11:00,2025-12-24 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122300267.htm,"The Government today (December 24) launched an open tender for the tenancy for operating and managing the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal (KTCT) (Tender Reference: TC 1/2025). Tenderers with relevant experience and expertise are welcome to participate.

The KTCT is an infrastructure specifically built for the berthing of mega-size cruise ships and is able to berth simultaneously two mega-size cruise ships with a gross tonnage of up to 220 000 tonnes each. The tenancy agreement with the current terminal operator will expire on May 31, 2028. Considering that international cruises plan their itineraries two years in advance, the Government is now launching the tender for the next tenancy to allow the terminal operator under the new contract to commence arrangements for cruise ship berthing as early as possible.

The selected operator under this tender exercise will operate and manage the KTCT for a term of 10 years. The Government may consider extending the term for a further five years, subject to the operator's satisfactory performance. To ensure that the selected operator possesses relevant operational experience and professional knowledge, tenderers must meet the essential requirements, i.e., at least three consecutive years of experience in operating and managing a cruise terminal facility within the past 10 years counting from the tender closing date, and experience in handling the berthing of cruises with gross tonnage of 160 000 tonnes or above.

A spokesperson for the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) said, ""The Action Plan on Development of Cruise Tourism under the Development Blueprint for Hong Kong's Tourism Industry 2.0 states that the Government's vision is to establish Hong Kong as Asia's hub for international cruises. The smooth operation of the KTCT is vital to attracting more cruise ships to berth in Hong Kong and promoting the development of Hong Kong's cruise industry. The Government is also committed to elevating the function of the KTCT as a cruise terminal for all and making good use of the terminal facilities.""

Having reviewed the terms and conditions of the tenancy agreement with the terminal operator and consulted relevant stakeholders, the Government will make two main adjustments in the next tenancy agreement to boost the appeal and competitiveness of the KTCT:

(1) Consolidating the management of the KTCT

To improve the management of the KTCT and enhance operational efficiency, the operator under the next tenancy agreement will, in addition to handling cruise-related matters, be responsible for managing the public space of the KTCT, including the podium gardens on the second floor and the KTCT Park at the rooftop. The Government earlier received 14 expression of interest submissions from commercial organisations, cultural and creative industries, sports organisations and young entrepreneurs on how to better utilise the space of the KTCT. Most expressed interest in leasing the ancillary commercial area and public space in one go. Private organisations or non-profit-making organisations can rent the public space of the KTCT for organising commercial and other activities, thereby promoting the KTCT for hosting more non-cruise and commercial events during the cruise low season and on days when fewer cruises berth there to better utilise the space at the KTCT.

(2) Introducing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the work of the terminal operator

To strengthen the monitoring of the terminal operator's performance, the Government will introduce the following four KPIs in the next tenancy agreement:

(i) the number of ship calls per year;
(ii) the number of non-cruise related events per year;
(iii) the number of visitors brought by non-cruise related events per year; and
(iv) the occupancy rate of ancillary commercial areas.

Taking into account that the terminal operator requires time to adjust and adapt to the terminal operation, the provisions regarding compensation to the Government arising from the operator's failure to meet the targets will take effect from the third year of the tenancy agreement.

A ""two-envelope approach"" will be adopted in the tender assessment. A weighting of 70 per cent will be allocated to the assessment of the non-price proposal and 30 per cent to the price proposal. The non-price proposal includes the aforementioned KPIs as well as the execution plan for the operation and management of the KTCT. The tender must comply with the requirements specified in the tender documents. The detailed assessment criteria are set out in the tender documents.

Interested tenderers may download the tender documents from the CSTB's website (www.tourism.gov.hk/en/tender_notice.php) or obtain the tender documents from the Tourism Commission (Address: 11/F, Hong Kong Li-Ning Building, 218 Electric Road, Fortress Hill, Hong Kong) during office hours. Tenderers must deposit the tenders by noon on May 22, 2026 (Friday), in the Government Secretariat Tender Box situated at the Lobby of the Public Entrance on the Ground Floor, East Wing, Central Government Offices, 2 Tim Mei Avenue, Tamar. Late tenders will not be accepted.

是次招標中獲選的營運商將負責營運和管理啟德郵輪碼頭，為期十年。如表現理想，政府可考慮與營運商續約五年。為確保獲選的營運商具備相關營運經驗和專業知識，投標者必須符合以下必要條件：自截標日起計的過往十年內，擁有至少連續三年營運郵輪碼頭的經驗，且曾接待總噸位160 000噸或以上的郵輪。

文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）發言人表示：「《香港旅遊業發展藍圖2.0》中的《郵輪旅遊發展行動計劃》指出，政府的願景是推動香港作為亞洲國際郵輪樞紐。啟德郵輪碼頭的暢順運作對吸引更多郵輪停泊香港及推動香港的郵輪業發展十分重要。政府亦致力提升郵輪碼頭服務大眾的功能，善用碼頭的設施。」

經檢視與碼頭營運商的租約條款及條件，以及諮詢相關持份者的意見，政府在下一份租約會作出兩項主要調整，以提升啟德郵輪碼頭的吸引力和競爭力：

（一）整合現時碼頭範圍的管理安排

為改善郵輪碼頭管理及提升營運效率，下一份租約的營運商除了負責處理郵輪事務外，將需要負責管理碼頭的公共空間，包括位於二樓的平台花園及天台的啟德郵輪碼頭公園。政府早前已收到14份由商業機構、文創產業和體育組織，以及青年創業者提交如何善用郵輪碼頭空間的意向書，大部分表示有興趣同時租用碼頭附屬商業區以及公共空間。私人機構或非牟利團體可租用碼頭的公共空間舉辦商業及其他活動，藉此推動更多非郵輪和商業活動在郵輪淡季及較少郵輪停泊的日子在郵輪碼頭舉行，以善用郵輪碼頭的空間。

（二）就碼頭營運商的工作引入關鍵績效指標

為加強監察碼頭營運商的表現，政府在下一份租約中，會引入下列四個關鍵績效指標：

(i) 每年郵輪停泊次數；
(ii) 每年非郵輪活動次數；
(iii) 每年非郵輪活動的訪客人數；以及
(iv) 附屬商業區的租用率。

考慮到碼頭營運商需時調整和適應碼頭運作，因營運商的表現未能達到指標而須向政府作出補償的條款將於租約第三年起生效。

是次招標會採用「雙信封」投標安排。在評審標書時，非價格建議和價格建議的比重分別為百分之七十和百分之三十。非價格建議除了上述關鍵績效指標外，也包括有關碼頭營運和管理的執行計劃。標書必須符合招標文件內的條款規定。評審準則已詳細列於招標文件內。

有意投標者可透過文體旅局網頁（www.tourism.gov.hk/tc/tender_notice.php）下載招標文件，或於辦公時間內到旅遊事務署索取（地址：香港炮台山電氣道218號香港李寧大廈十一樓）。投標者須於二○二六年五月二十二日（星期五）中午十二時前把投標書放入添馬添美道2號政府總部東翼地下公眾入口大堂的「政府總部投標箱」內遞交。逾期遞交的投標書概不受理。

如有查詢，可經電郵ktcttenderenquiry@cstb.gov.hk與旅遊事務署聯絡。"

  A department spokesman said that the adjustment on January 1, 2026 would reflect the movement of the LPG international price in December 2025. The adjusted auto-LPG ceiling prices for dedicated LPG filling stations would range from $3.15 to $4.07 per litre, amounting to an increase of $0.10 to $0.11 per litre.

  The spokesman said that the auto-LPG ceiling prices were adjusted according to a pricing formula specified in the contracts. The formula comprises two elements - the LPG international price and the LPG operating price. The LPG international price refers to the LPG international price of the preceding month. The LPG operating price is adjusted on February 1 and June 1 annually according to the average movement of the Composite Consumer Price Index and the Nominal Wage Index.

  The auto-LPG ceiling prices for respective dedicated LPG filling stations in January 2026 are as follows:

Interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements releases latest information and appeals to public and visitors to plan cross-boundary trips early for Christmas long weekend,2025-12-24 10:07,2025-12-24 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400199.htm,"The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, released the following information today (December 24) on the traffic and public transport arrangements for the upcoming Christmas long weekend (December 24 to 28).

During the Christmas long weekend, in anticipation of a large number of members of the public, visitors and cross-boundary vehicles visiting various land-based boundary control points (BCPs) during the Christmas long weekend, the Transport Department (TD) urged cross-boundary travellers to use public transport services travelling between Hong Kong and the Mainland or Macao and to plan their trips early and allow sufficient travelling time.

The TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators (PTOs) to strengthen their services during the long weekend to accommodate diverse travelling needs of passengers, including:


Increasing the frequency of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) shuttle bus (Gold Bus) to an average of about one minute during peak hours, if needed;
Increasing the frequency of the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) to an average of about two minutes during peak hours, if needed;
Increasing the quota of cross-boundary coaches to strengthen services;
The frequency of local franchised bus B routes connecting various land-based BCPs will also be increased to a level higher than that of normal weekends, and the operators concerned will reserve sufficient vehicles and manpower to meet passenger demand; and
The MTR Corporation Limited will enhance the train services of the East Rail Line between Admiralty and Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau at different times during the above period to provide convenience for the travelling public and visitors.


It is anticipated that the waiting time for public transport services including the Gold Bus and the franchised bus B routes may be longer. Passengers should make their journeys during non-peak hours, observe order while queuing and heed advice from on-site Police and staff of PTOs concerned. Passengers planning to take cross-boundary coaches are also advised to reserve their coach tickets in advance.

Of note, motorists of cross-boundary private cars crossing the border are advised that, subject to actual traffic conditions, special traffic arrangements may be implemented at the Lok Ma Chau Control Point and the Shenzhen Bay Port during the above period to secure smooth access for public transport vehicles to the above control points. Cross-boundary private cars may need to queue up for a longer waiting time for crossing the BCPs during peak periods. Motorists should pay extra attention to variable message signs and traffic signs along the roads. In case of traffic congestion, they should remain patient and follow the instructions of on-site Police.

For the HZMB, to plan their journeys ahead, members of the public can make use of the TD's HKeMobility mobile app or website (hkemobility.gov.hk/en/traffic-information/live/cctv) to access snapshots of traffic conditions at inbound and outbound vehicle plazas of the HZMB Hong Kong Port. They can also check real-time situations of the vehicle clearance plaza of the Zhuhai Port through the WeChat official accounts ""hzmbzhport"" or ""zhuhaifabu"" (traffic-info.gzazhka.com:5015/#/) (Chinese only). Moreover, motorists are reminded to always comply with the traffic control measures implemented by the Zhuhai authority when driving on the HZMB Main Bridge. Vehicles shall not occupy the emergency lane unless instructed by the Zhuhai authority.

The public and visitors may visit the one-stop information platform on immigration clearance ""Easy Boundary"" (www.sb.gov.hk/eng/bwt/status.html?type=outbound) launched by the Security Bureau or the TD's HKeMobility mobile app for the latest information on various land-based BCPs more conveniently. The TD will provide information on the services and waiting times of the Gold Bus, the Yellow Bus and the MTR on the platform. Members of the public are advised to check the latest traffic news through radio and television broadcasts, the TD's website and HKeMobility during the long weekend.

The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements is tasked with holistically co-ordinating and steering the preparatory work of various government departments for welcoming visitors to Hong Kong during the Christmas and New Year festive periods, as well as strengthening information dissemination to enable the public and visitors to plan their itineraries according to the latest situation."

"""Cross-boundary Health Record"" function of eHealth extended to all Hong Kong users to facilitate cross-boundary medical care ",2025-12-24 09:30,2025-12-24 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122300624.htm,"  The Health Bureau (HHB) announced today (December 24) that the ""Cross-boundary Health Record"" function in the eHealth mobile application (eHealth App) has been extended to all approximately 6.3 million eHealth users in Hong Kong, with immediate effect. Previously limited to eligible elderly recipients of the Elderly Health Care Vouchers (EHCVs), the extension enables more citizens to securely use their electronic health records (eHRs) across the boundary at designated medical institutions outside Hong Kong, thereby enhancing continuity of care.

  Starting today, all eHealth users in Hong Kong may apply for their eHRs deposited in the eHealth system over the past three years through the ""Cross-boundary Health Record"" function in the eHealth App, before attending medical consultations at 20 designated medical institutions outside Hong Kong (see Annex for the list). Upon application, users will instantly receive an Application QR Code and a Password QR Code via the App. When attending consultations at designated medical institutions, users may present these QR codes to healthcare professionals, to grant permission for them to access and browse relevant health records on a designated web browser, thereby supporting diagnoses and treatment. To ensure data privacy and security of personal eHealth accounts, users will be notified via selected communication means (such as SMS or email), whenever a designated medical institution accesses their health records. Moreover, users may apply for the service on behalf of family members using the ""Caregiver"" function in the eHealth App.

  A spokesperson for the HHB said, ""The eHealth system serves as the backbone infrastructure for medical data in Hong Kong. In response to the growing trend of Hong Kong citizens using healthcare services in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the Government has been maintaining close communication with relevant Mainland authorities and medical institutions in achieving convenient and secure usage of eHRs across the boundary through the eHealth system, so as to enhance the quality and safety of cross-boundary medical services. Throughout the process, we have strictly adhered to the overarching principles of ensuring due compliance of laws and regulations in Hong Kong and the Mainland, and that data security and patient privacy are fully safeguarded. The extension of the ""Cross-boundary Health Record"" function to all Hong Kong citizens marks a significant milestone in advancing cross-boundary healthcare collaboration. We will continue to take forward the sharing of cross-boundary medical records in an orderly manner, with a view to supporting citizens' cross-boundary healthcare needs more effectively.""

  Since July last year, the HHB has gradually rolled out the ""Cross-boundary Health Record"" function at a total of 20 medical institutions, namely the University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen Hospital and all medical institutions under the Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme, to enable eligible elderly recipients of EHCVs to use their personal eHealth records across the boundary. The response to this function has been positive. As of November this year, more than 7 800 elderly persons have used the ""Cross-boundary Health Record"" function, submitting over 9 400 applications.

  For more details of the ""Cross-boundary Health Record"" function, citizens may visit the eHealth thematic websiteor call the hotline at 3467 6300. The hotline service runs from 9am to 9pm from Mondays to Fridays (except public holidays)."
CHP investigates imported measles case,2025-12-23 21:00,2025-12-23 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/23/P2025122300735.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (December 23) is investigating an imported measles case and reminded members of the public who are non-immune to measles to ensure that they have completed two doses of measles vaccination before travelling to reduce the risk of infection.

The case involves a seven-month-old boy who developed fever, cough and runny nose on December 17. He was brought to seek medical attention from a private doctor on December 19. The boy developed a rash on December 21. He was brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of Caritas Medical Centre and admitted on the same day for treatment. His clinical specimen was tested positive for the measles virus upon nucleic acid testing. He is isolated for treatment and is currently in stable condition.

  The patient stayed outside Hong Kong from October 1 to December 16. As he spent the whole incubation period outside Hong Kong, the case was classified as an imported case.

An epidemiological investigation revealed that the boy has not yet reached the age to receive the first dose of the measles vaccine. His parents are household contacts and also his travel collaterals. They had not received measles vaccination. The patient's mother presented a fever on December 18. The CHP is arranging testing for her.

Apart from seeking medical attention, the patient mainly stayed at home during the communicable period. The CHP is reaching out contacts who visited the private clinic during the same period on December 19, to identify if high risk persons were involved. The CHP will assess if they had immunity against measles and will arrange vaccinations for contacts who are non-immune. The CHP will continue to put the relevant contacts under medical surveillance. Management of relevant private clinic was requested to report to the CHP if any persons develop measles symptoms for follow up.

The CHP's investigation is ongoing.

""Measles remain as an endemic infection in many places around the world. The number of measles cases in some overseas countries has been increasing recently. The outbreaks in North America (including the United States and Canada), Europe and Southeast Asia areas (including Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines) are ongoing due to the relatively low vaccination rate. Furthermore, an increasing number of measles cases have also been recorded in Japan and Australia this year. Overseas cases mainly affected people who were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. This shows the importance of maintaining a high vaccination rate and herd immunity within the community. For those who plan to travel to areas with measles transmission, they should check their vaccination records and medical history as early as possible. If they have not been diagnosed with measles through laboratory tests and have never received two doses of measles vaccine or are not sure if they have received a measles vaccine, they should consult a doctor at least two weeks prior to their trip for vaccination. Pregnant women and women preparing for pregnancy who are non-immune to measles as well as children aged under one year who are not due for the first dose of Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) combined vaccine under theHong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme, are advised not to travel to places with outbreaks of measles,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""The incubation period of measles (i.e. the time from infection to onset of illness) is seven to 21 days. Symptoms include fever, skin rash, cough, runny nose and red eyes. If travellers returning from places with high incidence or outbreak of measles develop symptoms of measles (e.g. fever and rash), they should seek medical advice immediately and avoid contact with non-immune persons, especially pregnant women and infants under one year old. They should also report their symptoms and prior travel history to the healthcare workers so that appropriate infection control measures can be implemented at the healthcare facilities to prevent any potential spread,"" Dr Tsui added.

 ""Under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme, the overall immunisation coverage in Hong Kong has been maintained at a very high level through the immunisation services provided by the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres and School Immunisation Teams. As evidenced by the findings on vaccination coverage of primary school students and the territory-wide immunisation surveys conducted regularly by the DH, the two-dose measles vaccination coverage has remained consistently high, well above 95 per cent, and the local seroprevalence rates of measles virus antibodies reflect that most people in Hong Kong are immune to measles. However, Hong Kong, as a city with a high volume of international travel, still faces the potential risk of importation of the measles virus and its further spread in the local community. Hence, a small number of people who have not completed a measles vaccination (such as non-local-born people including new immigrants, foreign domestic helpers, overseas employees and people coming to Hong Kong for further studies) are still at risk of being infected and spreading measles to other people who do not have immunity against measles, such as children under 1 year old who have not yet received the first dose of the measles vaccine,"" he continued.

 People born before 1967 could be considered to have acquired immunity to measles through natural infection, as measles was endemic in many parts of the world and in Hong Kong at that time. People born in or after 1967 who have not yet completed the two doses of measles vaccination or whose measles vaccination history is unknown, should consult their family doctors as soon as possible to complete the vaccination and ensure adequate protection against measles.

 Besides being vaccinated against measles, members of the public should take the following measures to prevent infection:


Maintain good personal and environmental hygiene;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
Keep hands clean and wash hands properly;
Wash hands when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;
Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and mouth discharge properly;
Clean used toys and furniture properly; and
Persons with measles should be kept out of school till four days from the appearance of a rash to prevent the spread of the infection to non-immune persons in school.

衞生防護中心正調查一宗外地傳入麻疹個案,2025-12-23 20:22,2025-12-23 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/23/P2025122300704.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月二十三日）正調查一宗由外地傳入的麻疹個案，並提醒對麻疹未具備免疫力的市民外遊前應確保完成接種兩劑麻疹疫苗，以減低受感染風險。

個案涉及一名七個月大男童，他於十二月十七日起出現發燒、咳嗽及流鼻水，並於十二月十九日向私家醫生求醫。他於十二月二十一日起出現皮疹，同日被帶到明愛醫院急症室求醫，獲安排留院接受治療。他的臨床樣本經檢測後證實對麻疹病毒核酸檢測呈陽性反應。病人正接受隔離治療，現時情況穩定。

病人於十月一日至十二月十六日逗留在外地。由於病人在整個潛伏期內不在香港，故此列為外地輸入個案。

流行病學調查顯示，男童尚未適齡接種第一劑麻疹疫苗。他的父母為家居接觸者，亦是同行人士，他們過去未曾接種麻疹疫苗。病人的母親於十二月十八日出現發燒，中心正為其安排檢測。

除前往求診外，病人於傳染期內主要留在居所。中心正聯絡曾在十二月十九日同一時段到訪該私家診所的接觸者，以找出是否涉及高危人士，並評估他們對麻疹是否具備免疫力，及安排未具備免疫力的接觸者接種麻疹疫苗。中心會繼續對相關接觸者進行醫學監察，並要求相關私家診所負責人如發現出現麻疹病徵的人士，應向中心報告，以便中心跟進。

中心的調查仍然繼續。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「麻疹在全球多個地方一直為風土病。近期部分海外國家的麻疹個案呈上升趨勢，其中北美洲（包括美國及加拿大）、歐洲及東南亞地區（包括越南、柬埔寨和菲律賓），因疫苗覆蓋接種率偏低而出現麻疹持續爆發。另外，日本和澳洲今年錄得的麻疹個案亦有所上升。海外大部分個案未曾接種麻疹疫苗或疫苗接種史不詳，反映了維持整體高疫苗接種率及群體免疫力的重要性。因此，計劃前往麻疹流行地區的市民，應及早檢視自己的疫苗接種紀錄及病歷，若以往未經化驗確診感染麻疹，以及從未或不確定曾否接種兩劑麻疹疫苗，應在出發前最少兩星期諮詢醫生接種疫苗。對麻疹沒有免疫力的懷孕婦女及計劃懷孕婦女，以及仍未適齡在「香港兒童免疫接種計劃」下接種麻疹、流行性腮腺炎及德國麻疹混合疫苗的未滿一歲的兒童，不應前往出現麻疹爆發的地區。」

徐樂堅醫生補充：「麻疹的潛伏期（即由感染後到發病的時間）為七至21日。麻疹病徵包括發燒、皮膚出現紅疹、咳嗽、流鼻水和眼紅等。由麻疹高發病率或出現麻疹爆發的地區回港的旅遊人士如出現麻疹病徵（例如發燒、紅疹等），應立即求醫，並避免接觸對麻疹未有免疫力的人士（尤其是孕婦和未滿一歲的嬰兒）。他們亦應在求診前預先知會醫護人員有關的病徵及旅遊史，以便醫療機構安排適當的感染控制措施，防止可能出現的傳播。」

他續說：「在『香港兒童免疫接種計劃』下，透過衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院及學童免疫注射小組提供的免疫接種服務，本港整體免疫接種覆蓋率一直維持在非常高水平。根據小學學童的免疫接種覆蓋率及衞生署定期進行全港免疫接種覆蓋調查顯示，兩劑麻疹疫苗接種的整體覆蓋率一直維持在95%以上，而本地麻疹病毒抗體的血清陽性率反映絕大部分香港市民對麻疹已有免疫力。然而，香港作為國際旅遊頻繁的城市，仍面對輸入麻疹病毒及其在本地社區進一步傳播的潛在風險。少數未完成接種麻疹疫苗的人士（例如非本地出生人士，包括新移民、外傭、海外僱員及來港升學人士）仍有機會受感染，並把麻疹傳播給其他未具備麻疹免疫力人士，例如一歲以下尚未接種第一劑麻疹疫苗的幼兒。」

在一九六七年前出生的市民，由於當時麻疹在全球多個地方及香港仍屬風土病，故可視為透過自然感染而對麻疹具備免疫力。一九六七年或以後出生而尚未完成接種兩劑麻疹疫苗或對麻疹疫苗接種史不詳的人士，應盡快諮詢家庭醫生以完成接種，以確保市民對麻疹有足夠保護力。

除接種麻疹疫苗外，市民應採取以下措施預防感染麻疹：

• 維持良好的個人及環境衞生；
•保持室內空氣流通；
•保持雙手清潔，並用正確的方法洗手；
•雙手被呼吸系統分泌物弄污後（如打噴嚏後）應立即洗手；
•打噴嚏或咳嗽時要掩着口鼻，並妥善清理口鼻排出的分泌物；
•徹底清潔用過的玩具和家具；及
•病患者在出疹後的四日內不應上學，避免將疾病傳染給未有免疫力的人。

漁護署就元朗豬場檢出非洲豬瘟病毒繼續進行銷毀豬隻行動（附圖）,2025-12-23 20:05,2025-12-23 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/23/P2025122300681.htm,"就漁農自然護理署（漁護署）十二月十七日公布，在元朗流浮山一持牌豬場的豬隻樣本檢測出非洲豬瘟病毒的事件。漁護署根據非洲豬瘟應變方案，十二月十九日起展開行動，派員到涉事的持牌豬場銷毀及處理所有場內豬隻，行動截至今日（十二月二十三日），共銷毀及處理978頭豬隻。

漁護署已就事件通報世界動物衞生組織，同時已聯同內地及國際專家進行流行病學調查，以防控非洲豬瘟病毒進一步傳播。在完成銷毀所有場內豬隻後，漁護署會為該豬場安排徹底清潔及消毒。

漁護署上周已安排獸醫巡查有關豬場三公里內一個正營運的豬場，並從豬隻抽取樣本進行非洲豬瘟病毒檢測，巡查期間發現豬隻健康情況無異常，而非洲豬瘟病毒測試結果均為陰性，因此署方已恢復該豬場運出豬隻到屠房屠宰的相關程序。

就是次非洲豬瘟個案，漁護署一直與食物環境衞生署保持溝通，相關部門已即時暫停從涉事豬場收集禽畜廢物、加強清洗涉事豬場附近的公共路段，以及徹底清潔及消毒相關動物屍體收集站與動物屍體收集車，並調整恆常動物屍體收集路線，以減低非洲豬瘟病毒傳播的風險。此外，漁護署亦已聯同專家前往涉事豬場實地視察及調查，並收集環境樣本作進一步分析，了解豬隻感染非洲豬瘟的可能原因及源頭，並提供生物保安措施及農場管理的優化建議，以助本地養豬業界進一步防控非洲豬瘟。

漁護署今日與持牌豬場的農戶進行會議，提醒農戶妥善實施良好生物保安措施，如發現豬隻健康有異，應即時通知該署。同時，漁護署人員會繼續巡查本港所有持牌豬場，以確保豬農妥善實施良好生物保安措施。漁護署亦加強監察涉事豬場附近的野豬活動。

除以上措施外，漁護署亦一直就非洲豬瘟防控工作與內地及國際獸醫專家保持緊密聯繫，並根據他們的意見已實行一系列防控措施，包括：

（一）漁護署已修訂《飼養豬隻牌照規定》，要求高感染風險的本地豬場妥善實施由署方指定的生物保安規條，並會為相關豬場提供技術支援，以防控非洲豬瘟；
（二）漁護署已於十一月邀請非洲豬瘟防控專家為所有本地豬農進一步講解及提供培訓，以協助豬場盡快落實並嚴格遵守適用於其豬場的生物保安措施，從而有效地在不同層面遏止非洲豬瘟在本地豬場傳播；
（三）為加強豬農對非洲豬瘟病徵的認識以及早察覺並通報豬隻的異常狀況，漁護署已推出《非洲豬瘟個案呈報指引》，協助豬農偵察疑似個案，及早呈報並作出適當跟進；
（四）漁護署人員已派發非洲豬瘟病毒快速測試劑給所有本地豬場，協助他們加強檢測；及
（五）漁護署人員和豬農保持密切聯繫，讓他們知悉非洲豬瘟的最新情況。

漁護署強調非洲豬瘟並非人畜共通傳染病，不會傳染給人類，因此不會構成食物安全風險。豬肉煮熟後可放心食用，市民無需擔心。今次個案並不影響本地屠房運作及整體活豬供應。

由於銷毀程序需時，漁護署網頁www.afcd.gov.hk會每日更新有關行動的情況，方便公眾查閱。"
AFCD continues culling operation at pig farm in Yuen Long after detection of African Swine Fever virus (with photos),2025-12-23 20:05,2025-12-23 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/23/P2025122300691.htm,"  Regarding the incident announced by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) on December 17 in which samples of pigs from a licensed pig farm in Lau Fau Shan, Yuen Long, tested positive for African Swine Fever (ASF), the AFCD launched an operation on December 19 according to the ASF contingency plan. The AFCD has sent staff to cull and handle all pigs on the affected licensed farm. As of today (December 23), a total of 978 pigs have been culled and handled.

The AFCD has notified the World Organisation for Animal Health of this incident. An epidemiological investigation in collaboration with Mainland and international experts is under way to prevent and control further spread of the ASF virus. Following the culling of all pigs on the farm, the AFCD will arrange thorough cleaning and disinfection of the farm.

AFCD has arranged veterinary inspections of one operating pig farm within 3 kilometres of this index farm last week and collected samples from pigs for ASF virus testing. No abnormal health condition was noted in the pigs during the inspection, and all samples have tested negative for the ASF virus. Therefore, the AFCD has resumed the relevant procedures for the farm to transport pigs to slaughterhouses for slaughter.

In view of the current ASF case, the AFCD has been liaising closely with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. The relevant departments have immediately ceased the collection of livestock wastes from the index farm, enhanced cleansing of the nearby public roads around the index farm, and thoroughly cleaned and disinfected relevant animal carcass collection points and animal carcass collection vehicles, as well as adjusted the routine animal carcass collection routes, to minimise the risk of spread of ASF. Moreover, the AFCD has conducted joint inspections and investigations at the index farm with experts and collected environmental samples for further analysis, with an aim to understand the potential cause and source of ASF infection. Advice on optimising biosecurity measures and farm management have also been provided to support the industry in further preventing and controlling ASF.

The AFCD held a meeting with licensed pig farm operators today to remind them to ensure proper implementation of good biosecurity measures and alert the Department immediately if any abnormal health condition is observed in pigs. Meanwhile, the AFCD personnel will continue to inspect all local licensed pig farms to ensure good biosecurity measures have been properly implemented. Surveillance of the activities of wild pigs in the vicinity of the index farm has also been stepped up.

Apart from the measures mentioned above, the AFCD has been maintaining close communication with Mainland and international veterinary experts and has implemented a series of preventive measures based on their advice, including:

(1) The AFCD has revised the licence conditions for pig farms, requiring local pig farms of high infection risk to properly implement biosecurity requirements specified by the Department. The AFCD will provide technical assistance to pig farms concerned to prevent and control ASF;
(2) The AFCD has invited an expert on ASF prevention and control to provide training to local pig farmers in November this year to facilitate prompt implementation and strict observation of the biosecurity measures specific to their pig farms, thereby effectively containing the spread of ASF on local pig farms on different levels;
(3) In order to strengthen the knowledge of local pig farmers about the clinical signs of ASF for early detection and reporting of abnormalities in pigs, the AFCD has launched the Guidelines for Reporting Cases of African Swine Fever to assist pig farmers in identifying suspected cases for early reporting and to take appropriate follow-up;
(4) AFCD staff have been distributing ASF rapid test kits to all local pig farms to assist them in enhancing testing; and
(5) AFCD staff are keeping close communication with pig farmers to update them on the latest situation of ASF.

The AFCD stressed that ASF is not a zoonotic disease and will not infect humans; hence, it does not present any food safety risk. Pork cooked thoroughly is safe for consumption. Members of the public do not need to be concerned. The incident does not affect the operation of local slaughterhouses nor the overall supply of live pigs.

Due to the ongoing culling operation, the AFCD will release daily updates on operational information on the departmental webpage (www.afcd.gov.hk) for public reference."

Interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements releases latest information on cross-boundary passenger traffic estimation and arrangements for Christmas and New Year festive periods,2025-12-23 18:55,2025-12-23 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/23/P2025122300617.htm,"The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, released the following information today (December 23) on the latest situation and arrangements for the upcoming Christmas and New Year festive periods.

The Immigration Department (ImmD) estimates that around 11.52 million passengers (including Hong Kong residents and visitors) will pass through Hong Kong's sea, land and air control points during the upcoming Christmas and New Year festive periods (from December 24 to 28, December 31, 2025 to January 4, 2026). The ImmD, in consultation with the Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection and other Mainland authorities, estimates that around 9.65 million passengers will pass through land boundary control points. The number of outbound and inbound passengers using land boundary control points (BCPs) will be relatively higher on December 25 (Thursday) and December 28 (Sunday), with around 689 000 passengers and 695 000 passengers respectively.

The ImmD estimates that the passenger traffic at the Lo Wu Control Point, the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point and the Shenzhen Bay Control Point will be heavy, with a daily average forecast of about 225 000, 201 000 and 161 000 passengers respectively.

In view of a series of New Year's Eve countdown events, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has discussed with the Shenzhen Municipal Government to extend the service hours of BCPs on New Year's Eve. The Mainland port authorities have duly reported to the national port authorities for approval according to the required procedures. Further details will be announced as soon as possible. The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) BCP and the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang BCP will maintain 24-hour operation as usual on New Year's Eve.

To cope with the anticipated heavy traffic during the festive period, the ImmD has minimised leave for frontline officers for flexible deployment and operation of additional counters, temporary counters and channels. Additional security guards will also be deployed to provide crowd management support.

Furthermore, the ImmD, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Customs and Excise Department and the MTR Corporation Limited will set up a joint command centre at the Lo Wu Control Point to make necessary arrangements. The ImmD will also establish close communication with Mainland authorities, including the Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection. To ensure a smooth passenger traffic flow, passenger conditions will be closely monitored and appropriate traffic diversion plans will be adopted when necessary.

The ImmD advises all land boundary passengers to plan in advance, avoid making their journeys during busy periods and keep track of radio and TV broadcasts on traffic conditions at various control points. Residents and visitors may also visit ""Easy Boundary"" (www.sb.gov.hk/eng/bwt/status.html?type=outbound), a one-stop information platform on immigration clearance launched by the Security Bureau, to obtain useful information in one go, including the respective average waiting time for passengers and private cars at land BCPs, as well as for the HZMB cross-boundary shuttle bus and the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus, so as to plan their trips and save waiting time.

For travellers making journeys to the Mainland, the ImmD reminds them to carry their proof of identity and valid travel documents for crossing the boundary. Hong Kong residents should also check the validity of their Home Visit Permits. Non-permanent residents must carry their valid smart identity card as well as their Document of Identity for Visa Purposes or valid travel document.

Holders of the acknowledgement receipt issued due to reported loss or replacement of their Hong Kong identity cards, or children under 11 years old who hold Hong Kong identity cards, should carry a valid travel document or Re-entry Permit.

About 700 e-Channels have been installed at various control points. To further enhance the clearance efficiency of control points and allow more Hong Kong residents to use the fast and convenient e-Channel service, the ImmD has adjusted the applicable age for e-Channel service for holders of smart identity cards. Eligible Hong Kong permanent residents aged 7 to 10 years old, who are at least 1.1 metres tall and hold a smart identity card and a valid HKSAR passport, can use the e-Channels without prior enrolment for self-service immigration clearance via face recognition technology at all control points. Moreover, the Contactless e-Channel service is available at all control points now. All eligible Hong Kong residents, after enrolment, can generate an encrypted QR code through the Contactless e-Channel mobile application to enter the e-Channel and then verify their identity with the facial verification technology for automated immigration clearance.

In addition, the ImmD has extended the e-Channel service to holders of a valid People's Republic of China (PRC) electronic ordinary passport aged 7 or above and are in transit through Hong Kong to and from another country or territory. Eligible PRC passport holders can use the e-Channel service when entering Hong Kong without prior enrolment for e-Channel service via face recognition technology. Additionally, all control points have introduced self-service departures for visitors to Hong Kong (Smart Departure), which provides greater travel convenience for visitors. The service employs facial recognition technology for identity verification, which allows eligible visitors holding electronic travel documents aged 7 or above to perform self-service departure clearance through Smart Departure e-Channels without prior enrolment. Furthermore, the ImmD has adjusted the applicable age for e-Channel service for holders of Electronic Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao (e-EEP). Eligible holders of e-EEP aged 7 or above, who are at least 1.1 metres tall, can use the e-Channels without prior enrolment for self-service immigration clearance via fingerprint recognition technology at all control points.

Hong Kong residents who require assistance while travelling outside Hong Kong may call the 24-hour hotline of the Assistance to Hong Kong Residents Unit of the ImmD at (852) 1868, call the 1868 hotline using network data or use the 1868 Chatbot via the ImmD Mobile App, send a message to 1868 WhatsApp assistance hotline or 1868 WeChat assistance hotline or submit the Online Assistance Request Form.

The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements is tasked with holistically co-ordinating and steering the preparatory work of various government departments for welcoming visitors to Hong Kong during the New Year's Eve and New Year festive periods, as well as strengthening information dissemination to enable the public and visitors to plan their itineraries according to the latest situation."
特區政府節慶安排跨部門工作小組發放最新資訊：聖誕節及元旦假期期間經陸路往返內地的旅客流量預測及有關安排,2025-12-23 18:55,2025-12-23 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/23/P2025122300615.htm,"由政務司司長領導的節慶安排跨部門工作小組今日（十二月二十三日），就今年聖誕節及元旦假期的最新情況及安排，發放以下最新資訊：

今年聖誕節及元旦假期期間（即二○二五年十二月二十四日至二○二五年十二月二十八日及二○二五年十二月三十一日至二○二六年一月四日），入境事務處（入境處）預計約有1 152萬人次（包括香港居民及訪客）經各海、陸、空管制站進出香港。經入境處與深圳出入境邊防檢查總站（邊檢總站）等內地部門協商後，預計約有965萬人次會經各陸路邊境管制站進出香港。預計陸路出境高峰期為十二月二十五日（星期四），出境人次約689 000，而入境高峰期為十二月二十八日（星期日），入境人次約695 000。

入境處估計假期期間羅湖管制站、落馬洲支線管制站及深圳灣管制站將會非常繁忙，預計每日平均分別約有225 000、201 000及161 000人次出入境。

因應除夕跨年倒數活動的舉行，香港特別行政區（特區）政府與深圳市政府已商討延長除夕的關口服務時間。內地口岸部門已經按程序要求上報國家口岸部門進行審批，詳情會盡快公布。而港珠澳大橋口岸以及落馬洲／皇崗口岸在除夕夜會如常二十四小時通關。

為疏導假期期間的旅客流量，入境處已減少前線人員休假，以便彈性調配人手，加開檢查櫃枱、臨時櫃枱及通道以疏導人流及車流。同時，入境處亦會增派保安人員協助維持旅客過關秩序。

另一方面，入境處亦會連同香港警務處、香港海關和香港鐵路有限公司在羅湖管制站成立聯合指揮中心，以作出相應的部署及採取適當措施，並與深圳邊檢總站等內地部門緊密聯繫，密切留意人流情況及在有需要時採取適當分流疏導措施，確保過關人流暢順。

入境處呼籲所有經陸路往返內地的旅客應預早計劃行程，盡量避免選擇在繁忙時段過關，並留意有關各邊境管制站交通情況的電台或電視廣播。市民及旅客亦可瀏覽保安局推出的一站式過關資訊平台「口岸通」（www.sb.gov.hk/chi/bwt/status.html?type=outbound），一次過取得各陸路邊境管制站旅客和私家車過關平均輪候時間，以及港珠澳大橋過境穿梭巴士和落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士的平均輪候時間等有用資訊，以便計劃行程及減省等候時間。

入境處呼籲旅客在過關前往內地時，應緊記帶備身分證明文件及前往內地的有效旅行證件。香港居民出門前應檢查回鄉卡的有效日期，而香港非永久性居民則須帶同其有效的智能身份證及簽證身份書或旅行證件過關。

至於因遺失或補領身份證而獲發申請香港身份證收據的市民，或未滿十一歲而已領有香港身份證的兒童，他們應同時帶備有效的旅行證件或回港證過關。

現時入境處已在各管制站裝設約700條e-道。為進一步提升管制站的通關效率，讓更多的香港居民使用便捷的e-道服務，入境處已調整智能身份證持有人使用e-道服務的適用年齡，七歲至十歲及身高達1.1米或以上的香港永久性居民只要持有智能身份證和有效的特區護照，無須預先登記便可在各管制站使用e-道服務，以容貌識別技術自助辦理出入境檢查手續。另外，「非觸式e-道」服務現已經擴展至所有管制站，已登記的合資格香港居民可透過「非觸式e-道」手機應用程式產生加密二維碼進入e-道，再配合容貌識別技術核實身分自助辦理出入境檢查手續。

此外，入境處已擴展e-道服務至持有有效的中華人民共和國電子普通護照及經香港過境往來另一國家或地區的七歲或以上人士。合資格的中華人民共和國護照持有人可以免登記在入境時使用e-道服務，利用容貌識別技術自助辦理入境手續。同時，各管制站已向訪港旅客提供更方便的自助離境服務「離境易」。這項服務採用容貌識別技術核實訪港旅客的身分，讓七歲或以上合資格並持有電子旅行證件的訪港旅客經「離境易」e-道辦理自助離境手續，無須預先登記。入境處亦調整電子往來港澳通行證持有人使用e-道服務的適用年齡，七歲或以上及身高達1.1米或以上的電子往來港澳通行證持有人，無須預先登記便可在各管制站使用e-道服務，以指紋識別技術自助辦理出入境檢查手續。

香港居民在外旅遊時如需協助，可致電入境處「協助在外香港居民小組」的24小時求助熱線，電話：（852）1868；透過入境處流動應用程式以網絡數據致電「1868」熱線或使用1868聊天機械人；發送訊息至1868 WhatsApp求助熱線或1868微信求助熱線；或提交網上求助表格求助。

節慶安排跨部門工作小組負責全面統籌並督導各政府部門有關除夕及元旦假期期間接待訪港旅客的預備工作，以及加強資訊發布，方便市民及旅客按最新情況規劃行程。"

In addition, the number of research and development (R&D) personnel showed a steady increase over the years and reached 47,210 in 2024 (compared with 43,403 in 2023).

A government spokesman said, ""The country indicates clear support in the National 14th Five-Year Plan and the Recommendations for the 15th Five-Year Plan for Hong Kong to develop into an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre. Promoting I&T development has always been one of the key policy areas of the current-term Government. In recent years, the Government has been focusing on encouraging innovation activities, developing I&T infrastructure, strengthening basic research and promoting commercialisation of R&D outcomes, attracting and nurturing talent, supporting start-ups, etc. Moreover, since taking office, the current-term Government has been actively enhancing the local I&T ecosystem by consolidating our strengths in upstream basic research, accelerating the midstream transformation and realisation of scientific research outcomes, and supporting industry development in the downstream. Various initiatives have achieved good progress. It is encouraging to see that the GERD and the GERD as a ratio of the GDP have recorded satisfactory growth in 2024. With three major I&T parks and five key R&D institutions as the framework, we will continue to propel I&T development at full steam by proactively promoting the synergistic development among upstream, midstream and downstream sectors in Hong Kong.”

The spokesman also stated that a series of measures have been announced in the 2025 Policy Address, including expediting the development of the third InnoHK research cluster as well as that of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone (the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park, HSITP), promoting the development of new industrialisation, launching the $10 billion I&T Industry-Oriented Fund, etc., to achieve high-quality economic development through technological empowerment. Since announcing the 2025 Policy Address, the Government has made strides in progressing various measures. For example, the HSITP has officially opened in December. The Government also promulgated the Conceptual Outline of the Development Plan for the Innovation and Technology Industry in the San Tin Technopole in November this year to advance the development of the Loop and San Tin Technopole San Tin area under the new strategic layout plan of ""South-North dual engine (finance-I&T)"".

""The Government will continue to take forward various policy measures to create favourable conditions for Hong Kong's I&T development, with a view to further promoting the development of I&T and new quality productive forces in Hong Kong, and realising the vision of developing Hong Kong into an international I&T centre,"" the spokesman added."
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-23 17:30,2025-12-23 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/23/P2025122300533.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 23), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. As the CHP and relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails recently, the CHP continues to appeal to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

  The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm. All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

  Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

  
  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
