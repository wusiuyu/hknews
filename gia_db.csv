Pest Control Steering Committee provides updates on latest progress of interdepartmental mosquito control and prevention work against chikungunya fever at Tsing Yi Nature Trails (with photos),2025-12-12 23:49,2025-12-13 00:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200963.htm,"  The interdepartmental Pest Control Steering Committee (PCSC) provided updates today (December 12) on interdepartmental mosquito control and prevention work progress against chikungunya fever (CF) at Tsing Yi Nature Trails.

  PCSC members, including the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), and various bureaux and departments, have been working closely in mosquito prevention and control. In 2025, the PCSC held a number of meetings to monitor the mosquito infestation situation, and provide steer to interdepartmental anti-mosquito actions:

(1) At the meeting on March 14, the PCSC discussed the follow-up actions of various departments in response to the anti-mosquito work plan for 2025 that was discussed at the previous meeting at the end of last year;

(2) At the meeting on July 23, the PCSC examined the latest mosquito infestation situation and anti-mosquito measures taken by various departments and discussed measures to prevent CF, particularly in response to a significant increase in CF cases in neighboring areas and some overseas countries. Given the frequent travel of Hong Kong residents to various places, there was a potential risk of local transmission. The PCSC also urged departments to promptly initiate a new round of mosquito prevention and control actions to clear potential breeding grounds after Typhoon Wipha that hit Hong Kong, and thereafter continue to proactively implement mosquito control measures;

  In addition, on August 1, the Chairperson of the PCSC, along with the representatives from the CHP and the FEHD, met with trade representatives to discuss the latest situation regarding CF and the situation overseas, as well as Hong Kong's risk assessment, border control, emergency preparedness, and public education work. The meeting also urged the trade representatives to step up anti-mosquito work at venues under their purview;

  Furthermore, between July 24 and August 12, the Secretary for Environment and Ecology and the Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology conducted inspections in various districts respectively to assess the relevant response work against CF;

(3) On October 27, following the first local CF case, the PCSC convened a special meeting, urging relevant departments to strengthen mosquito control efforts in areas under their purviews. The District Offices of the FEHD also held interdepartmental meetings at the district level to undergo risk assessment and conduct targeted measures;

  Besides, on October 27, the Secretary for Environment and Ecology visited Fung Tak Estate, where the first local CF case was reported, to inspect the mosquito control work;

(4) The FEHD has consistently acted upon notifications from the CHP of CF and other mosquito-borne diseases by immediately informing relevant departments of their follow-up to the taken. Upon receiving notifications on November 13 of a case involving for the first time a patient who had visited Tsing Yi Nature Trails and reported mosquito bites, the FEHD promptly initiated response measures at the trail and simultaneously informed relevant departments for their follow-up actions to be taken;

  On November 24, in response to several imported CF cases reportedly being bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails before symptoms onset, the Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology visited the vicinity of Tsing Yi Nature Trails to learn about the progress of the response work carried out by the FEHD and other relevant departments since November 13;

  At the meeting on November 28, the PCSC reviewed the latest situation regarding CF and the corresponding response efforts, particularly on Tsing Yi Nature Trails:

(a) The progress of the FEHD's operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes and remove mosquito breeding sites, including the use of large ultra-low volume foggers and trial of robotic dogs to enhance effectiveness. The FEHD also installed new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could lead to stagnant water, and applied larvicidal oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that could not be immediately cleared. Pamphlets were distributed to hikers in the area to raise awareness about mosquito infestations; and

(b) The progress made by the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing District Lands Offices, the Drainage Services Department (DSD) and the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) in strengthening their actions along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails.

  On the same day, the District Environmental Hygiene Superintendent (Kwai Tsing) of the FEHD held a meeting of the inter-departmental task forces to discuss the latest developments related to the situation and to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders to strengthen mosquito prevention and control measures in venues and areas under their purview;

  On November 28, the CHP determined, based on epidemiological investigation and genome analysis results, that two cases in which the patients visited Tsing Yi Nature Trails, should be classified as locally cases;

(5) In response to the announcement of another local case on December 1 who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the Committee Chairperson sent an email to the members on December 2 to inform them of the update and asked them to report on the progress of the follow-up work as requested by FEHD in mid-December. On December 4, the CHP, based on epidemiological investigation and genome analysis results, announced another local case who had also visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. On December 6, the CHP announced the determination of another case which had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Having conductedinspections, the FEHD informed individual departments on December 10 of the outstanding follow-up work. On the same day (December 10), the CHP announced another local case who had also visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails.

  In the meeting, planned to be held in the later half of December, apart from the anti-mosquito work plan for 2026 originally put on the agenda, the PCSC will also examine the progress of follow-up work by various departments in detail.

  The FEHD has been conducting regular monitoring of vectors for dengue fever and CF, and has been carrying out comprehensive mosquito control measures across Hong Kong to reduce the risk of transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. The FEHD has set up Aedes albopictus mosquito traps in 64 monitoring areas and all port areas across Hong Kong to monitor the distribution and density of Aedes albopictus in various districts, and to carry out targeted mosquito control work. In addition, the FEHD conducts regular inspections to understand the mosquito situation in various districts and to take early action to control mosquito problems. The mosquito control efforts of the FEHD and relevant departments will not slacken under the cooler weather, and the territory-wide mosquito control campaign is still on-going. The work of various departments is co-ordinated through the PCSC to enhance effectiveness.

  In response to the CF cases, the FEHD has adopted various methods to eliminate vector mosquitoes. These include intensive fogging treatments using ultra-low volume sprayers, which significantly reduce the adult mosquito population in the shortest possible time. Additionally, efforts are made to target the larval stage of mosquitoes by eliminating breeding grounds and applying larvicides, thereby reducing the chance of vertical transmission of the virus in vector mosquitoes (i.e. transmission to the next generation). Furthermore, the FEHD will set up mosquito traps in relevant locations to assess the effectiveness of mosquito control measures. Given that the typical lifespan of a female mosquito is about one month, the related mosquito control efforts will continue for more than a month to eradicate virus-carrying female mosquitoes. Adjustments or extensions will be made based on the latest developments and assessment results of the cases.

  The Tsing Yi Nature Trails are situated in a countryside environment and cover a vast area, with the hiking trails stretching approximately 7 000 metres. Compared with urban settings, mosquito control work there faces greater challenges. Along both sides of the trails, various natural breeding grounds for vectors, including puddles on soil surfaces and fallen leaves, increase the risk of mosquito breeding.

  Currently, tools such as large ultra-low volume foggers and robot dogs have been deployed by the FEHD to conduct 49 fogging operations to kill adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails, covering the entire trails and the perimeter. The FEHD has also eliminated about 1 800 potential mosquito breeding sites, applied larvicide oil or larvicides at around 240 areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately, and installed 29 new mosquito trapping devices. The department is also actively exploring the use of stairlifts and drones to assist in fogging operations. Furthermore, the department has set up 40 temporary mosquito traps at the trail to monitor the effectiveness of the measures and the mosquito situation, and collect adult mosquitoes for vector surveys.

  In addition, pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging the public to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also visited nearby schools and childcare facilities to provide information and assistance on mosquito prevention and control.

  The FEHD has stepped up inspections of construction sites and residential premises near the trails, instituted two prosecutions against parties responsible for violations related to mosquito breeding, and issued eight statutory notices requiring the elimination of stagnant water.

  The Kwai Tsing District Office (K&TDO), responsible for the maintenance of the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, has instructed its contractor to enhance mosquito prevention and control measures, including grass cutting, clearing blockages in drainage, conducting fogging operations, and application of larvicide oil or larvicides. In addition, the K&TDO has displayed posters at the entrances, pavilions and sitting-out areas along the trails to remind visitors and hikers to use insect repellents and take protective measures. K&TDO also continuously disseminates information on mosquito prevention to residents in the district through the local networks of the District Council Members, Area Committees and Care Teams.

  The DSD has conducted multiple drainage cleaning operations in the vicinity of the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, removing silt and debris from drainage facilities to ensure smooth drainage and prevent stagnant water and mosquito breeding.

  The District Lands Office of Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing has progressively removed illegal cultivations, structures, metal canopies, and bamboo sticks on relevant government land.

  The CEDD has requested contractors and site supervisory staff to arrange site inspections, including its surrounding areas, to ensure that the mosquito prevention measures taken are as effective as possible. Mosquito prevention and control measures include conducting regular inspections, removing stagnant water, applying larvicidal oil, and setting up mosquito traps on-site with regular checks and replacement of baits.

  The PCSC emphasised that it will continue to closely monitor the mosquito situation in Hong Kong and, as always, convene meetings in a timely manner before the rainy season and when necessary to discuss and follow up on inter-departmental mosquito control efforts."

Advisory Committee on Mental Health co-ordinates multiple measures to support mental health needs relating to Tai Po fire (with photos),2025-12-12 23:40,2025-12-12 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200984.htm,"  The Task Force on Mental Health Support Following the Tai Po Fire under the Advisory Committee on Mental Health (ACMH) held the second meeting today (December 12) to discuss multiple measures to provide mental health support to families and members of the public affected by the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. The ACMH adopted the stepped care model on mental health and provides services covering prevention, early identification, targeted assessment and referral to specialist services, to take care of the mental health needs of the affected residents and members of the public from different aspects.

  The Chairman of the ACMH, Dr Lam Ching-choi, said, ""In the face of this unfortunate incident, we must build a more comprehensive mental health support network. The Task Force is co-ordinating and enhancing multiple measures, aiming to provide timely and appropriate support to every affected family, accompany them through their pain, and help them rebuild their lives.""

The major measures being co-ordinated by the Task Force are as follows:

(1) Compassionate Support Programme for Bereaved Families (the Programme)

  Following yesterday's (December 11) announcement on the participation of Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui Welfare Council, the Comfort Care Concern Group, and the Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong in the one-year Programme, three more non-governmental organisations (NGOs) joined the Programme today, namely The Salvation Army, St. James' Settlement, and Suicide Prevention Services. The seven NGOs will arrange multi-disciplinary professional teams comprising social workers, clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and counsellors to provide bereaved families with free mental health support services such as grief and bereavement counselling, and actively reach out to the bereaved families. At present, they have established contacts with families of about 130 deceased. In addition to proactive outreach by the participating organisations to bereaved families, relevant families may also call the ""18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline"". The hotline will arrange dedicated follow-up and provide targeted grief and bereavement counselling after receiving their calls. For enquiries about the Programme, please contact the participating organisations. Details are in the Annex.

(2) Project to enhance mental health support in transitional housing projects where Wang Fuk Court residents are living in

  The ACMH will implement a project in the transitional housing projects where Wang Fuk Court residents are living in and provide additional mental health resources, including the consideration of arranging additional mental health related professional manpower (especially psychiatric nurses) and adding facilities for setting up support stations through universities and NGOs, with a view to providing more tailored mental health services.

(3) Primary healthcare support in the community

  The Primary Healthcare Commission has set up a hotline service at District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses across all 18 districts for affected residents to provide personalised case management services, including specialised healthcare, nursing, and medication services, as well as psychological support. Since December 1, the hotline has received 97 calls, and referred 28 cases to private family doctors participated in the free family doctor service scheme, and provided mental health support services to 29 attendances. In addition, the ""Healthy Mind Pilot Project"" and the JC JoyAge Project will also be extended to Tai Po and nearby areas, with outreach teams proactively contacting local residents to conduct preliminary emotional questionnaire assessments and, for those in need, provide evidence based low intensity psychological therapy, so that they can receive more comprehensive care and support.

(4) Strengthening the Student Mental Health Support Scheme (SMHSS)

  The Government is exploring the provision of support services to about 15 primary and secondary schools in Tai Po with relatively more students living in Wang Fuk Court through the SMHSS. Based on the medical-educational-social collaboration model, multi-disciplinary teams will be arranged to provide comprehensive assessments at schools to affected students with mental health needs, to formulate, implement and evaluate individual care plan, and to provide appropriate intervention services.

(5) The Hospital Authority (HA) and professional organisations to provide professional training for frontline staff

  The HA and professional organisations will assist in training staff of relevant social service organisations to enhance their knowledge of and skills in responding to reactions and stress brought about by disasters."
兩名入境旅客管有及進口未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-12-12 23:33,2025-12-12 23:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200986.htm,"兩名入境旅客分別因進口應課稅品條例適用的貨品、管有未完稅香煙和未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》，今日（十二月十二日）在粉嶺裁判法院分別被判處監禁六星期及罰款一千元，和監禁四星期及罰款八百元。

Two incoming passengers convicted and jailed for possession and importation of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2025-12-12 23:33,2025-12-12 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200987.htm,"âTwo incoming passengers were sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment with a fine of $1,000, and four weeks' imprisonment with a fine of $800 by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (December 12) for importing goods to which the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) applies, possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of DCO.

Customs officers intercepted a 40-year-old incoming male passenger and his accompanying child on December 5 at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point. The officers found a total of 2,381 duty-not-paid cigarettes on the man and from the backpack carried by the child. The estimated market value of the seized cigarettes was about $9,700 and the duty potential was about $7,800. The male passenger was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment and fined $1,000.

In addition, Customs officers intercepted a 48-year-old incoming female passenger at the same control point on December 10, and seized 1,600 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $6,500 and a duty potential of about $5,200, from a backpack in her possession. The female passenger was sentenced to four weeks' imprisonment and fined $800.

Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Hong Kong Customs detects two drug trafficking cases at airport and shuts down dangerous drugs distribution centre (with photos),2025-12-12 22:35,2025-12-12 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200919.htm,"Hong Kong Customs detected a trafficking case involving air cargo and a drug trafficking case involving a passenger at Hong Kong International Airport, and shut down a suspected dangerous drugs distribution centre in Tai Po, seizing a total of about 15 kilograms of suspected ketamine, 1kg of suspected cannabis buds, 40 capsules of suspected etomidate, 660 grams of suspected liquid etomidate, 8g of suspected cannabis oil and 1.7kg of suspected heroin, with a total estimated market value of about $8.9 million. Three males were arrested.

In the first case, through risk assessment and intelligence analysis, Customs officers on December 4 inspected an air parcel, arriving in Hong Kong from Belgium declared as carrying an office display product, at Hong Kong International Airport. Upon inspection, about 15kg of suspected ketamine, with an estimated market value of about $6.1 million, was found concealed inside the parcel.

After follow-up investigations, Customs officers conducted a controlled delivery operation yesterday (December 11) and arrested two male consignees, aged 46 and 29, in Sha Tin and Tai Po respectively. Customs officers then escorted the 29-year-old arrested man to his premises in Tai Po for a search and further seized about 1kg of suspected cannabis buds, 40 capsules of suspected etomidate, 660g of suspected liquid etomidate and 8g of suspected cannabis oil, with a total estimated market value of about $2.1 million.

The second case involved a 25-year-old male passenger arriving in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, today (December 12). During customs clearance, Customs officers found 1.7 kg of suspected heroin with an estimated market value of about $680,000, concealed in his carry-on suitcase. The man was subsequently arrested.

The investigation of the first case is ongoing. The arrested person in the second case has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug and he will appear at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (December 13).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-12 22:33,2025-12-12 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200968.htm,"   The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, announced today (December 12) that the Government has established an Independent Committee in relation to the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po to examine the causes of the incident and related issues to prevent similar tragedies in the future. Mr Justice David Lok has been appointed as the Chairman. The Independent Committee will formally commence operation in late December, with a view to completing its work within nine months of commencing operations.

  Meanwhile, the three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements – continue to make full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

  For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3.3 billion as of noon today. With the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.6 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

  The Government earlier announced that a living allowance from the Support Fund will be provided to each affected household, and the amount has been increased from $50,000 to $100,000. As of today, 1 838 cases have been processed. In addition, the Government will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 128 cases have been processed. The allowance will be disbursed in phases.

  Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 980 affected households, and more than 4 900 residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

  As of this morning, a total of 1 451 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 3 059 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS).

  In consideration of the extremely urgent situation of the residents affected by the fire incident, a special arrangement of a full rent exemption has been made earlier by the Housing Bureau to provide accommodation support to those affected residents moving into transitional housing or HKHS projects. In other words, if needed, the affected residents can stay for a longer period of time. The Government will continue to support the affected residents in terms of accommodation, and the residents in need do not have to worry about the relevant rental expenses or the duration of stay. In addition, with the generous community support and donations, all the currently available units in transitional housing and HKHS projects are equipped with furniture and appliances such as bed frames, mattresses, induction cookers and water heaters, etc, enabling the residents to settle in comfortably. At the same time, a number of organisations have proactively stationed their staff in some projects to provide residents in need with various forms of support, including free medical and legal consultation services. The Government is committed to assisting the affected residents, supporting their accommodation needs to the fullest, and standing together with them.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 800 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, about 19 600 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Regulation and inspection work
----------------------------------

  Upon liaison with the Police, the Housing Department has started to remove the burnt scaffolding on the external walls of Wang Cheong House, Wang Tai House and Wang Sun House today. At the same time, the Independent Checking Unit of the Housing Bureau has completed strengthening works, including concrete grouting and erecting temporary props, in a small number of units that may be subject to more serious damage.

  The Development Bureau (DEVB) announced yesterday a new mechanism for sampling and testing scaffold nets for external walls in Hong Kong. The Buildings Department is preparing for the issuance of a new practice note to registered contractors and will meet with the industry next week. The DEVB is moving ahead in full steam the supporting arrangements to ensure that there are sufficient designated laboratories and a suitable site for off-site sampling work.

  The Labour Department (LD) completed a two-week special enforcement operation today, targeting building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding erected. The LD inspected a total of 467 construction sites, with 249 written warnings and 112 improvement notices issued as well as 25 prosecutions initiated. The LD will continue to focus on inspecting the improvement progress of construction sites with violations detected and work sites where scaffold nets have been removed from the external walls of buildings."

委員會各成員，包括衞生署衞生防護中心（防護中心）、食物環境衞生署（食環署）及各決策局及部門，均緊密合作，防控蚊患。在二○二五年，委員會的多次會議上均審視蚊患情況，並督導跨部門防治蚊患工作：

（1） 在三月十四日會議上，因應去年底會議已討論的二○二五年防治蚊患工作計劃，委員會討論各部門跟進部署情況；

（2） 在七月二十三日會議上，委員會審視蚊患最新情況和各部門的防治蚊患工作及討論預防基孔肯雅熱的措施，特別是因應鄰近地區及部分海外國家的基孔肯雅熱感染個案數字大幅上升，香港市民頻繁往來各地，可能引發本地傳播風險，並要求各部門盡快採取新一輪防蚊滅蚊行動，清理颱風韋帕襲港構成的潛在蚊子滋生地及其後繼續積極採取防蚊滅蚊行動；

另外，在八月一日，委員會主席聯同防護中心人員及食環署人員與業界代表會面，介紹基孔肯雅熱最新情況和香港以外地方的情況，以及香港的風險評估、口岸防控、應急準備及宣傳教育等工作，並呼籲業界在其轄下場所加強防蚊滅蚊工作；

再者，在七月二十四日至八月十二日期間，環境及生態局局長和副局長就基孔肯雅熱分別到各地區視察，檢視有關應對工作；

（3） 在十月二十七日，委員會因應香港出現首宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案召開特別會議，敦促各部門在其所屬範疇內加強防蚊滅蚊；食環署各分區辦事處亦在地區層面召開跨部門會議，進行風險評估，並落實各項針對性措施；

另外，在十月二十七日，環境及生態局局長亦到出現首宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的鳳德邨視察控蚊工作；

（4）食環署均一直按機制在每次收到防護中心通報的基孔肯雅熱等蚊媒疾病個案後，隨即通知相關部門作出跟進行動。就十一月十三日接獲的通報，首次有個案曾前往青衣自然徑並報稱受到蚊叮，食環署隨即在該處展開應對工作，並同步知會相關部門須跟進事項；

在十一月二十四日，因應當時有數宗基孔肯雅熱輸入個案在發病前曾於青衣自然徑一帶行山並報稱受到蚊叮，環境及生態局副局長到青衣自然徑一帶視察，了解食環署自十一月十三日以來在該處各條行山徑持續進行的應對工作進展和相關部門跟進工作的進展；

在十一月二十八日的會議上，委員會檢視基孔肯雅熱的最新情況和應對工作，特別是就青衣自然徑：

（a）食環署持續殺滅成蚊及清除蚊子滋生地，並在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗以提升工作成效，亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑，以及向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患；及

（b）葵青民政事務處、荃灣葵青地政處、渠務署及土木工程拓展署在青衣自然徑加強其範疇的行動進展。

同日，食環署葵青區環境衞生總監亦舉行了跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊；

十一月二十八日，防護中心基於流行病學調查及基因數據分析結果判定兩宗曾前往青衣自然徑的個案為本地個案；

（5）因應十二月一日防護中心公布另一宗曾前往青衣自然徑的本地個案，委員會主席在十二月二日向成員發出電郵，讓他們了解更新情況，並要求他們在十二月中就食環署知會的須跟進事項匯報進展。十二月四日，就另一宗曾前往青衣自然徑的個案，防護中心公布基於流行病學調查及基因數據分析結果判定其為本地個案。十二月六日，防護中心公布另一宗曾前往青衣自然徑的本地個案。食環署因應實地視察，在十二月十日再知會個別部門尚須完成的工作。當日（十二月十日），防護中心再公布一宗曾前往青衣自然徑的本地個案；

委員會擬在十二月下旬舉行會議，除原定討論的二○二六年防治蚊患工作計劃的議題外，亦會詳細檢視有關部門跟進工作的進展。

食環署一直有恆常的登革熱／基孔肯雅熱病媒監察，並且全方位地於全港進行全面的防治蚊患工作，以減低相關蚊傳疾病的傳播風險。食環署在全港64個監察地區及所有港口地區設置白紋伊蚊誘蚊器，監察白紋伊蚊在各區的分布及密度情況，以進行針對性滅蚊工作。此外，食環署亦定期進行巡查，了解各區蚊患情況，及早防治蚊患。食環署及各相關部門的防治蚊患工作，並不會因天氣轉涼而鬆懈，全港性滅蚊行動仍在進行中，並透過委員會協調各部門工作，加強成效。

針對基孔肯雅熱個案，食環署已採取不同方法殺滅病媒蚊子，包括以超低微量噴灑器進行密集式霧化處理，在最短時間內大幅減低成蚊密度，亦針對蚊子幼蟲階段，進行清除滋生地及放置殺幼蟲劑，減低病毒在病媒蚊子跨代傳播（vertical transmission）的機會。此外，食環署亦會在相關地點設置誘蚊器，評估滅蚊工作成效。由於雌蚊的一般存活期約為一個月，因此相關的滅蚊工作亦會持續一個月以上，以殺滅帶有病毒的雌蚊，並會因應個案的最新發展及評估結果，作適時的調整或延長。

青衣自然徑屬郊野環境且覆蓋範圍甚廣，行山徑長約7 000米，與市區環境相比，控蚊工作面臨更大挑戰。該自然徑兩旁的地方均存在着各種天然病媒滋生地，包括泥土表面的水窪、落葉等，增加蚊蟲滋生風險。

至今，食環署已利用大型超低微量噴霧器及機械狗等工具在該處一帶進行49次霧化處理殺滅成蚊行動，範圍涵蓋整條自然徑及自然徑外圍。食環署亦已清理約1 800個潛在蚊子滋生地，並在約240個無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑，以及設置29個新型捕蚊器。署方亦積極探討使用電動爬梯機及無人機以協助其霧化處理殺滅成蚊的工作。

​另外，署方亦在該處設置了40個臨時誘蚊器，以監測措施成效及蚊患情況，也收集成蚊以進行病毒測試。

此外，食環署向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。同時，食環署亦到訪附近範圍內的學校和幼兒設施，提供防蚊滅蚊資訊及協助。

在巡查方面，食環署已加緊巡查自然徑附近一帶的地盤工地及住宅處所，向違規的負責人提出兩宗有關蚊蟲滋生的檢控及發出八張法定消除積水通知書。

負責青衣自然徑保養維修的葵青民政處已指示承辦商加強防蚊滅蚊工作，包括剪草、清理去水渠、進行霧化處理，以及施放蚊油／殺幼蟲劑等；已在青衣自然徑的出入口、涼亭及休憩處等張貼海報，提醒訪客及行山人士使用昆蟲驅避劑及採取防護措施；並透過區議員、分區委員會和關愛隊的地區網絡向區內居民持續宣傳防蚊資訊。

渠務署已於青衣自然徑一帶完成了多次渠道清理工作，將排水設施中的沙泥及雜物清除，確保渠道暢通以防止積水及蚊蟲滋生。

荃灣葵青地政處已逐步清除了在相關政府土地上的非法耕種植物／搭建物、金屬篷和竹枝。

土木工程拓展署已要求承建商及駐工地督導人員，巡視工地及其鄰近範圍，確保在工地採取的防蚊措施達到最佳成效。有關預防及滅蚊措施包括定期巡查、清理積水及噴灑蚊油，以及在工地內設置蚊子陷阱並定期檢查及更換藥粉等。

委員會強調，會繼續密切留意本港蚊患情況，並一如以往在雨季來臨前和在有需要時，適時召開會議，討論及跟進跨部門防治蚊患工作。"

諮詢委員會主席林正財醫生表示：「面對這次不幸事件，我們必須構建一個更全面的精神健康支援網絡。專責小組正統籌和加強多項措施，旨在為每一個受影響家庭提供及時和適切的支援，陪伴他們走過傷痛，重建生活。」

專責小組正統籌的主要措施如下：

（一）「守望．同行」災後喪親家庭支援計劃（「守望．同行」計劃）

繼昨日（十二月十一日）公布東華三院、香港聖公會福利協會、贐明會和香港撒瑪利亞防止自殺會已參與為期一年的「守望．同行」計劃，今日再有三間非政府機構加入，分別為救世軍、聖雅各福群會和生命熱線。七間非政府機構會安排由社工、臨床心理學家、精神科醫生及輔導人員組成跨專業團隊，為喪親家庭免費提供哀傷善別輔導等精神健康支援服務，並主動接觸喪親家庭，目前已分別與約130名離世人士的家庭建立聯繫。除了由參與機構主動接觸喪親家庭外，有關家庭亦可致電「情緒通」18111精神健康支援熱線。在接獲有關家庭的來電後，熱線會安排專人跟進，提供針對性的哀傷善別輔導。如對計劃有任何查詢，可與參與機構聯絡，詳情見附件。

（二）「凝聚．同行」計劃為有宏福苑居民入住的過渡性房屋項目加強精神健康支援

諮詢委員會會於有宏福苑居民入住的過渡性房屋項目推行「凝聚．同行」計劃，透過大學及非政府機構，增設精神健康資源，包括考慮安排額外精神健康專業相關人員（特別是精神科護士）及增設設施作支援站，以提供更適切的精神健康服務。

（三）社區的基層醫療支援

基層醫療署轄下的十八區地區康健中心／站為受影響居民設立熱線服務，提供個人化個案管理服務，包括特殊醫療、護理和藥物服務，以及心理支援。自十二月一日起，熱線共接獲97宗來電，轉介28宗個案至家庭醫生義診計劃下的私營醫療界別家庭醫生，以及為29人次提供心理健康支援。另外，「健康心靈先導計劃」及賽馬會樂齡同行計劃亦會擴展至大埔及鄰近地區，派出外展團隊主動接觸當區市民，進行初步情緒問卷評估，並為有需要的市民提供實證為本的低密度心理治療，讓他們得到更全面的照顧及支援。

（四）強化「醫教社同心協作計劃」

政府正研究透過「醫教社同心協作計劃」為約15所有較多學生居住於宏福苑的大埔區中小學提供支援服務，以醫、教、社協作模式，安排跨專業團隊在學校為受影響而有精神健康需要的學生提供全面的綜合評估，以及制訂、執行和檢視個別的護理計劃，提供適切的介入服務。

（五）醫院管理局及專業團體為前線同工提供專業培訓

醫院管理局及專業團體會協助培訓相關社會服務機構的同工，提升他們對災難反應及壓力的認識及應對技巧。"

同時，政府就大埔宏福苑火災成立的三個工作組——調查及規管工作組、緊急支援及募捐工作組，以及應急住宿安排工作組——繼續全力跟進火災的支援、善後及調查事宜，詳情如下：

經濟及福利援助
———————

截至今日中午，政府成立的「大埔宏福苑援助基金」已收到的外界捐款約33億元，連同政府投入的三億元啓動資金，基金總額約為36億元，會用在協助居民重建家園，是長期和持續的支援。

政府早前宣布從基金向每戶受影響家庭發放生活津貼，金額已由五萬元增至十萬元，截至今日已處理1 838宗個案；另外，就每名死者向家屬發放20萬元慰問金及五萬元殮葬金，截至今日已處理128宗個案。政府會陸續發放有關款項。

社會福利署（社署）社工已接觸超過1 980個受影響住戶，為超過4 900名居民登記「一戶一社工」服務。社署會與受影響住戶保持聯繫，為他們提供一切所需協助，並全力支援政府的善後工作。

住宿援助

截至今日上午，共有1 451名居民入住由民政及青年事務局協調的青年宿舍／營舍或酒店房間；另有3 059名居民現居於房屋局的過渡性房屋或香港房屋協會（房協）項目的單位。

考慮到受火災影響居民非常緊急的情況，房屋局早前已作出特別安排，對入住過渡性房屋或房協項目的受影響居民提供住宿援助，租金全免。換句話說，如有需要，受影響的居民可以較長期入住。政府會在住宿方面一直支援受影響居民，有需要的居民無需擔心相關租金開支或居住期。此外，在社會各界的熱心支援與捐贈下，目前所有過渡性房屋及房協項目可供入住的單位均已配備床架、床褥、電磁爐和熱水爐等家具電器，讓居民可以放心入住。同時，不少團體主動派駐人手到部分項目為有需要的居民提供不同方面的支援，例如免費醫療和法律諮詢服務。政府必定會盡力協助受影響居民，全力支援他們的住宿需要，與居民同行。

物資援助／捐獻
———————

政府與資訊科技業界構建的物資捐獻網上平台繼續運作，團體及市民可於平台登記可捐贈的物資。政府至今共收到超過1 800個登記，其中約三成由機構提出，而餘下的由市民個人提出。已登記可捐獻物品種類涵蓋食品及飲品、衣物、日常生活用品、寢具、電器等多個類別。政府正透過相關政策局、政府部門和服務團體掌握居民的實際需要後進行物資配對工作，以便陸續把適用物資派送往有需要的地點。至今已有約19 600件涵蓋不同類別的物資配送至多個地點。物資配對和分發工作會持續進行。

規管巡查
————

房屋署經與警務處協調，今日開始於宏昌閣、宏泰閣及宏新閣移除已被燒毀的外牆棚架。同時，房屋局獨立審查組已完成為結構損壞較嚴重的小量單位進行石屎牆身灌漿及石屎樓板臨時支撐等加固工程。

發展局昨日公布外牆棚網就地抽樣檢查新制度，屋宇署將於下星期約見業界團體，以擬備向註冊承建商發出新的作業備考。發展局正全力準備相關配套，以預備足夠指定實驗所，以及合適用地作場外採樣工作。

勞工處今日完成為期兩周針對設有大型棚架的樓宇維修工地的特別執法行動，共巡查了467個建築地盤，發出249份書面警告及112張「敦促改善通知書」，並提出25宗檢控。勞工處會繼續重點巡查違規地盤的改善情況及已移除樓宇外牆棚網的工地。"

We fully understand the grave concern of the community over the fire which broke out at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po on November 26. This was not only a serious fire but also a deeply distressing incident that caused great sorrow across our community. Many residents lost their lives, were injured, and lost their homes in the fire. We hereby express our sympathy and condolences to the victims, their families, and all those affected.

In the coming nine months, based on the Committee's terms of reference, the Committee will, regarding the fire broken out at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, its rapid spread and the resulting casualties and property damage, examine the causes and circumstances that led to the fire; the fire service installations and equipment in the buildings, and the supervision and responsibility for their effective operation; whether the construction safety requirements, standards, supervision and day-to-day maintenance regime for the building maintenance and renovation works were adequate; regarding the building maintenance and renovation works, whether the prevailing list of materials meeting safety standards is comprehensive, and whether the related verification and testing systems are effective; the roles and responsibilities of personnel with supervisory roles across all stages (including government officers, authorised professionals, contractors and others); and the liabilities arising from the aforementioned issues. Regarding large-scale building maintenance and renovation works, to the Committee will examine whether there were systemic problems such as undue connected interests, conflicts of roles, or improper collusion across all stages of the works; and whether bid-rigging corruption, or irregularities were involved in the tendering process of these works. Regarding the two matters above, the Committee will examine whether regulation and penalties under relevant existing laws are adequate.

Based on the findings of its review, the Committee will make recommendations to the Chief Executive to support the Government in undertaking in-depth reforms, with a view to preventing similar incidents from occurring again.

In conducting the review, we will collect information, and ensure that our work will be open, transparent and thorough. Members and I will do our utmost in discharging our duties. We will report to the Chief Executive within the time period requested of us."""

Mr Justice David Lok has been appointed as the Chairman, and Mr Chan Kin-por and Dr Rex Auyeung Pak-kuen have been appointed as Members.

The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, is extremely concerned about the Wang Fuk Court fire in Tai Po, which resulted in multiple casualties, and announced on December 2 that an independent committee led by a judge would be established to review the causes of the incident and related issues to prevent similar tragedies in the future.

The Terms of Reference of the Independent Committee are:

(1) Regarding the fire broken out at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, its rapid spread and the resulting casualties and property damage, to examine –

the causes and circumstances that led to the fire; the fire service installations and equipment in the buildings, and the supervision and responsibility for their effective operation; whether the construction safety requirements, standards, supervision and day-to-day maintenance regime for the building maintenance and renovation works were adequate; regarding the building maintenance and renovation works, whether the prevailing list of materials meeting safety standards is comprehensive, and whether the related verification and testing systems are effective; the roles and responsibilities of personnel with supervisory roles across all stages (including government officers, authorised professionals, contractors and others); and the liabilities arising from the aforementioned issues.

(2) Regarding large-scale building maintenance and renovation works, to examine –

whether there were systemic problems such as undue connected interests, conflicts of roles, or improper collusion across all stages of the works; and whether bid-rigging corruption, or irregularities were involved in the tendering process of these works.

(3) Regarding the two matters above, to examine whether regulation and penalties under relevant existing laws are adequate; and

(4) To make recommendations regarding matters in items (1) to (3) above.

The Independent Committee will formally commence operation in late December, with a view to completing its work within nine months of commencing operations. If the Independent Committee considers appropriate, it may publish interim report(s) at different stages, and provide recommendations to the Chief Executive. All the reports and recommendations made by the Independent Committee will be disclosed to the public (except for information which may involve judicial proceedings). Issues concerning legal liabilities of those involved in the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po on November 26, 2025 are matters for law enforcement agencies’ investigation. Such matters fall outside the scope of the Committee.

If in the course of its review work, the Independent Committee is of the view that, in order to conduct inquiry into specific issues or aspects, it is necessary to be provided with the same statutory powers as those of a commission of inquiry established under the Commissions of Inquiry Ordinance (Cap. 86), the Independent Committee may make recommendation to the Chief Executive.

Through a range of interactive experiences such as exhibition panels, game booths and educational videos, the exhibition aims to enhance the public's understanding of the Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance (Cap. 390) (COIAO) and promote healthy Internet use among children and young people.

 The first roving exhibition is open from 10.30am to 6.30pm at G/F, Atrium, Domain Mall in Yau Tong for three consecutive days starting today. Members of the public are welcome to visit. Details of the exhibition are available onOFNAA's website.

 The Director of Film, Newspaper and Article Administration, Mr Chaucer Leung, visited the first roving exhibition today, during which he said, ""OFNAA has been conducting publicity and educational work as well as working with various stakeholders to help children and young people develop the concept of the proper use of the Internet. I invite the public to bring their children to the exhibition to help them understand the importance of rejecting harmful materials."" Mr Leung also exchanged views with the Healthy Information Student Ambassadors of the Healthy Information Student Ambassadors Scheme 2025, thanked them for assisting in promoting the message of safe and healthy use of the Internet, and encouraged them to set a good example among their peers.

 In addition, OFNAA has actively strengthened interdepartmental collaboration through the past few months, working in conjunction with the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, the Education Bureau, the Hong Kong Police Force, and the Customs and Excise Department to promote information on the COIAO and the message on healthy Internet use to young people, teaching staff members and the public through social media and talks. Initiatives include participating in the Primary Principals Liaison Meeting and briefing principals of participating schools on OFNAA's support to schools; partnering with the Hong Kong Police Force to organise 13 ""Wise Use of Internet"" talks to share common online pitfalls with 2 600 members of the Junior Police Call as well as primary and secondary school students; and organising a talk for members of ""Customs YES"" to promote the message of rejecting harmful materials.

 With the aim of promoting the message of rejecting harmful materials to children and young people in a more targeted manner and enhancing their understanding of the COIAO, OFNAA also reached out to schools by introducing in-school mobile promotion stations in the current school year. The initiative seeks to allow the concept of healthy Internet use to take root firmly on campuses through enjoyable educational experiences fostered by activities including interactive games, case sharing, role play, quiz competitions and exhibitions. The first two sessions of in-school mobile promotion stations were held this week at primary and secondary schools in Tsuen Wan and Tseung Kwan O respectively, and the remaining 18 sessions will be held in the coming three months in various districts. It is expected that the initiative would attract about 4 000 participants.

 With the rising popularity of emerging platforms such as video streaming platforms, video sharing platforms and social media among children and young people, OFNAA will also enhance multimedia publicity efforts to produce animated promotional videos for uploading onto the Internet and for playback at various publicity programmes. Students will also be encouraged to share the videos with their friends, thereby promoting the message of rejecting harmful materials among peers. The animated videos will be released by the end of the month.

 OFNAA will continue to organise a series of programmes to actively promote the message of staying away from obscene and indecent content on the Internet, including talks, workshops, roving drama for schools, webinars, as well as the Healthy Information Student Ambassadors Scheme and the Healthy Chinese Public Speaking Competition.

行政長官就大埔宏福苑火災有關事宜會見傳媒開場發言及答問內容（附圖／短片）,2025-12-12 19:59,2025-12-12 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200773.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十二月十二日）就大埔宏福苑火災有關事宜會見傳媒的開場發言及答問內容：

行政長官：各位傳媒朋友、各位市民。大埔宏福苑火災奪去了160條寶貴的生命，我多次表明，要調查到底，不論涉及甚麼人都要一查到底，追責到底，認真改革。要讓真相水落石出，讓公義得以伸張，讓逝者安息，讓生者安心。

我上星期公布，會成立由法官主持的獨立委員會，審視事故的起火和迅速蔓延的原因及相關問題。在聯繫和聽取了終審法院張舉能首席法官的推薦後，我宣布委任陸啟康法官出任獨立委員會的主席，並委任陳健波先生和歐陽伯權先生作委員。我在此感謝張舉能首席法官的推薦，我更感謝陸啟康法官接受獨立委員會主席這重大責任，感謝兩位委員作出的承擔，查明事實真相，並為防範事故再發生和就改善措施作出建議。

獨立委員會的職權範圍如下：

（一）就大埔宏福苑起火、火勢迅速蔓延及火災造成的人命傷亡及財產損毀，審視――
成因和導致火災發生的情由；大廈配置的消防裝置及設備，及其有效運作的監督和責任問題；有關的樓宇維修工程的施工安全要求、標準、監督和日常維護制度是否足夠；針對樓宇維修工程，現行安全標準的用料清單是否全面，有關的驗證和檢測制度是否有效；各環節的監管機構和人員（包括政府部門人員、授權負責的專業人士及承建商等）的角色和責任承擔；以及上述問題相關的責任。

（二）針對大型樓宇維修工程，審視――
有關工程各環節有否不適當的相連利益、角色衝突、不當的合謀串連等系統性問題；及有關工程有否涉貪圍標、違規招標的問題。

（三）就上述兩項事宜，檢視現行相關法律的規管及懲罰是否足夠。

（四）就上述（一）至（三）的事宜，提出建議。

獨立委員會在九個月內完成報告。獨立委員會要審視的範圍很廣泛，尤其有關圍標和利益相連的系統性問題，問題眾多、性質複雜，為確保獨立委員會可在九個月內完成審視並編寫報告，獨立委員會的運作既要公正，亦要靈活高效，因此我賦予獨立委員會最大的主導權和靈活空間，簡化流程，有效地盡快完成這艱巨的工作。我亦會考慮給予獨立委員會備用權力，如獨立委員會在審視過程中，就特定議題或個別環節認為有需要獲賦予法定權力以完成其工作，可以向行政長官提出建議，讓獨立委員會就相關事宜按香港法例第86章《調查委員會條例》成為法定調查委員會，就該指定事宜行使法定權力，獲取所需資料和事實，讓獨立委員會歸納於其整個審視內容中，全面掌握事情的事實。

這種運作模式結合了主導及靈活的流程效率和法定調查委員會的權力行使，兩者有效配合運用，相輔相成，讓獨立委員會可在九個月內完成處理有關的廣泛和複雜問題。

獨立委員會的運作細節如下：第一，獨立委員會能全權主導以靈活和簡化流程的方法，既有效又公正的方式，進行審視工作。

第二，獨立委員會可設立專家小組，邀請相關專家向獨立委員會提供意見。

第三，如在審視工作的過程中，獨立委員會就特定議題或個別環節，認為有需要獲賦予《調查委員會條例》（香港法例第86章）下成立的調查委員會相同的法定權力進行調查，獨立委員會可向行政長官提出建議。行政長官會同行政會議經考慮後可決定根據《調查委員會條例》就該議題或環節的相關事宜讓獨立委員會成為法定調查委員會，行使相關權力。

獨立委員會在落實運作起九個月內完成工作。如獨立委員會認為合適，可在不同階段發表中期報告，並向行政長官提供建議。獨立委員會發表的所有報告及建議，將全面公開（涉司法程序的資料除外）。

獨立委員會會設立專責秘書處和法律團隊，以支援其工作。

為支持獨立委員會的工作，政府會全力配合。政府已成立由政務司司長領導的調查及規管工作組，會統籌政府所有相關部門，除按獨立委員會要求外，會主動向委員會提供資料，並會充分運用各政府部門在不同條例下的調查權力，協助獨立委員會蒐集證據和資料，全力支持獨立委員會的工作。

另外，我想談談受災人士的安置問題。在大火後，政府在短時間內，安置約4 000多名居民入住包括酒店、青年宿舍、過渡性房屋，以及房協項目的單位。

我關心受災人士的長遠住宿支援。我已指示應急住宿安排工作組組長、財政司副司長黃偉綸統籌各相關政策局及部門，研究及提出長遠方案，以情、理、法處理，照顧居民的個別情況和意願，亦要善用資源，協助受影響的家庭重建家園，盡快回復正常生活。

我們聽到社會不同的意見，包括：由房委會向業權擁有者購買業權；讓宏福苑業主優先購買居屋；在大埔區加建居屋；讓合資格的業主入住公屋單位等等。

每個居民的意願都不一樣，這點我很理解，我已指示黃偉綸副司長，全面收集受災人士的意見，然後作出後續方案需要考慮的選項，讓居民選擇。

小組會因應我的指示，在照顧受災人士的情緒下，全面收集受災人士的意見，作出分析，並盡快提交建議。

多謝大家。

記者：剛才提到審視中途委員會如果需要法定權力，可以向特首再提出。為何不一開始就成立有法定傳召權的獨立調查委員會？中途要多個程序，其實是否會令程序更複雜，令居民更久才得到結果？另外，也想問調查範圍包括政府部門，會否有「自己人徹查自己人」的嫌疑？另外，如果有政府高層需要負責的話，會否啓用部門首長責任制？謝謝。

行政長官：今次我用先驅性的方式做一個那麼複雜、問題那麼廣泛的獨立委員會，如剛才所說，我們要求獨立委員會審視的，分兩大方面：第一是宏福苑火災蔓延得那麼快，涉及的種種安全問題、角色責任問題，無論角色責任涉及甚麼人，我已說得很清楚，政府部門也好、非政府部門也好，一查到底，問責到底，所以絕對不會存在任何人可以逃避責任，不論他是政府人員或非政府人員。涉及那麼多問題，尤其是第二部分，很多大型的大廈維修工程，涉及那麼多可能的相連利益，也可能涉及舞弊、圍標等，這個問題相信大家也關注很久、很深，我亦相信涉及的利益複雜，所以要求獨立委員會九個月完成那麼複雜和廣泛的審視範圍，其實九個月時間很緊張，所以必須讓獨立委員會有最大的自主能力，自己可以主導審視程序如何進行、盡快做。

我亦容許它簡化程序，如果用法定獨立調查委員會的程序進行，很多程序就不能簡化，但我也希望可以賦權獨立委員會，如果真的面對一些問題，它認為需要行使法定權力，可以告訴所有人、預告所有人，任何人嘗試不配合、不合作，我們便會行使法定權力，讓獨立委員會成為法定獨立調查委員會。這樣的好處是既靈活、既簡化程序，又在需要時才運用法律程序行使法律權力，以獲得資料和事實。

舉例來說，有26項A至Z那麼多項事情，獨立委員會希望處理，靈活地、有效率地處理絕大部分。到G項的時候，它覺得需要有法定權力以獲取某些資料，就會更好完成這26項工作。所以針對G項，它可以向行政長官提出建議，而行政長官會同行政會議考慮建議後，就G項環節，容許獨立委員會成為法定上的獨立調查委員會，行使權力，就很清晰地針對G項。如果再有另一個Y項要做，也可以做。但在其他24項，便可以用很靈活、高效的方式，令獨立委員會可克服時間上的壓力。因為這次，特別是圍標，可能涉及腐敗和長期的利益關係，要打破這些利益藩籬，我相信獨立委員會的責任相當重大，並會面對很多挑戰。所以有足夠時間讓它在九個月內完成，必須有它認為能幫到它的高效方法。這是創新性地互相配合，效率配合權力，使用起來讓獨立委員會完成其工作。

第二，獨立委員會是獨立的。剛才大家也知道成員是陸法官，非常感謝陸法官，因為今次責任重大，事情很複雜、問題很廣泛，亦感謝陳健波先生和歐陽伯權先生，肯承擔這個重大的責任。他們是獨立的，而整個委員會也是獨立運作的。它有自己的秘書處和法律團隊，如有其他任何需要，我們都會幫忙。

另外，今次先驅性的做法，亦容許政府部門主動協助獨立委員會的工作。過去當有調查委員會也好，無論以甚麼形式成立的委員會，政府很可能是按委員會要求提供協助，即是被動式的。今次我們是主動式的，即是政府如認為某些資料獨立委員會可用來參考，我們會主動提供。當然，獨立委員會有絕對的權力去考慮與不考慮。但我們作為政府，今次表明是全力支持獨立委員會的工作，明確明白到挑戰大、複雜性大，亦很廣泛性，所以我們盡量運用政府部門所有可能調查或者監管的權力去幫助，主動提供資料給獨立委員會。即是說，在獨立委員會審視到由A至Z那麼多需要審視的事情當中，政府如果覺得某些資料可以幫助獨立委員會，都會主動提供。獨立委員會當然有絕對權力去考慮與不考慮。

另外，無論甚麼人士，我多次說過，其職位是甚麼、是基層或是高層，如果要負責就要負責，是很清晰的，這個問題無需再問，因為已經多次說過這是我很明確的立場，亦是我們的決心。我們追責時，當我們知道這個人所犯錯的地方是甚麼，就會按着事實去追究他的責任。我們沒有排除任何方法，但一定要讓需要負責的人士負上責任。

記者：如果接下來到北京述職，是否剛說到的獨立委員會和安置方案都會向主席報告？另外，關於安置方案，剛才提到也是盡快，是否認真來說沒有一個時間表何時要推出方案？還有也涉及一些無論是居屋換公屋、現金補償或原址安置，有沒有這些選項可以讓災民選擇？

行政長官：述職是每年一次。大家都知道，一向的做法是，我會在十二月到北京述職。我相信這個安排都會按這些年來的做法一樣。當有消息時，我會向大家公布。述職期間，我會向習近平主席以及北京的其他領導們，匯報香港的最新情況。

最新情況除了有關經濟、發展外，還一定會匯報民生工作。而在今次大埔大火發生當日，習近平主席已經表示高度重視，亦要求我們努力撲滅當時的大火，減少人命和財產的傷亡和傷害。當然，習近平主席已經表示高度關注，我必然會匯報特區政府在這方面所做的工作，以及香港社會「一方有難、八方支援」的共同力量；亦會表示香港所有人民都是共同關心怎樣幫助災民、共同關心幫助災民回復正常生活，以及我亦會推動整個社會回復正常生活，因為這是最有效幫助災民回復正常生活所必須做的一件事。

當然，獨立委員會的工作，會是我們處理今次整件大火事故的其中一部分。香港的整體情況，亦有其他部分我相信習主席希望知道的：最新的經濟情況、我們按「十四五」規劃的發展、部署和成績、我多年來的《施政報告》所做出來的成績、國際如何看香港、評級有否進步、哪些空間我們可以再強化、我們如何更好地積極和服務國家發展大局等，我相信這些也是我匯報內容的一部分。

至於安置受災人士的方案，剛才我已說得很清楚，我們聽到很多意見，很多意見的出發點都是很好的，但真真正正涉及這麼多戶受火災影響的家庭，每一個家庭的意願，我們必須慎重考慮。我說過應該以情、理、法處理這件事。以情先行，要講道理，亦要合乎法律，但情是第一個要點，所以我亦給予同事這方面的指導精神。在處理災民時，在事發第一天，我們都是盡量了解當事人的苦困、盡量在感情上、精神上支持他們。當然，其他我們可以資助的，例如金錢、物質、住所等，我們都會努力。但我覺得最重要的是，讓他們覺得我們關心、理解他們的艱難。我亦感謝社會各界在這方面共同努力幫助他們，向我們的支援基金亦非常踴躍捐輸，連同政府投入的三億元啓動資金，基金總額約為35億元。香港在這方面的大愛，我相信今次大家可以全面體會到。

我亦多謝在座各位記者朋友，無論在事故發生當天，到我們一直對於受災人士的支援等，你們都作出非常全面的報道，亦反映到整個社會無論不同行業，都非常關心和支持，希望大家感受到很有溫情的香港。在此再次多謝大家。

Remarks by CE on matters related to Wang Fuk Court fire in Tai Po at media session (with photo/video),2025-12-12 19:59,2025-12-12 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200776.htm,"  Following are the remarks by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, on matters related to the Wang Fuk Court fire in Tai Po at a media session today (December 12):

Reporter: Good afternoon, Mr Lee, some English questions. Firstly, would the Independent Committee have less investigative power to summon evidence and witnesses unlike a commission of inquiry, especially when the circumstances may not have officially been constituted as a crime yet? How would the Government intend to address this potential issue? With regard to your nine-month time frame as you mentioned, is this enough time? And do you foresee a possibility that you'll have to extend due to, as you mentioned, the complex and large-scale issues that the committee has to face? And the second question, on the potential redevelopment of Wang Fuk Court, what's the Government's plan and time frame on it so far? Does it have an idea where these funds will come from? And also, do you foresee a challenge in getting a consensus from the thousands of residents involved? Thank you.

Chief Executive: First of all, it is a mammoth task for the Independent Committee (Independent Committee Established in Relation to the Fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po) to achieve examining two very big issues. The first is regarding the causes and circumstances that led to the fire, including the examination of fire service installations and equipment in the buildings, and the supervision and responsibility for their effective operation; whether the construction safety requirements, standards, supervision and day to day maintenance regime for the building maintenance and renovation works were adequate; regarding the building maintenance and renovation works, whether the prevailing list of materials meeting safety standards is comprehensive, and whether related verification and testing systems are effective; the roles and responsibilities of personnel with supervisory roles across all stages, including government offices, authorised professionals, contractors and others; and the liabilities arising from the aforementioned issues. For just this theme, under this topic, you can say the amount of issues to be examined is already a lot.

  Then the Independent Committee will have to look at another very important issue, which is, regarding large-scale building maintenance and renovation works, to examine whether there are systemic problems such as undue connected interests, conflicts of roles, or improper collusion across all stages of the works; and whether bid-rigging corruption or irregularities were involved in the tendering process of these works. You can see this second issue is an issue that has been troubling a lot of Hong Kong people, because we all live in buildings, and we all, at some stage, will be doing large-scale renovation work, so it affects everybody. We have been seeing cases where a lot of problems have arisen. We should indicate that there are systemic problems, as I have highlighted in this second topic.

  So you are right, nine months is a very challenging time indeed, but I want to solve the problem as quickly as possible. I want to give what I regard as a realistic time frame, provided the Independent Committee is given sufficient means to manoeuvre. While ensuring the examination is just, they can streamline the procedure and be given more flexibility, so that they can finish their work within the nine months. I also have given them a reserve power; that is, if the Independent Committee considers, while examining all these complicated issues, there may be one which they think, by exercising the power that is given to a statutory commission of inquiry, will help them complete their work, then I am very willing to consider a recommendation by the Independent Committee to seek appointing them as the commission of inquiry. This is the reserve power I will give to them. First, to tell everybody that we must co-operate and assist the Independent Committee to do its very important job, because when the Independent Committee wants to exercise statutory powers, they will be given according to the law and the procedure with the CE-in-Council, considering the recommendation and then deciding to appoint a commission of inquiry with the Independent Committee functioning as such. That will help the Independent Committee to finish all the different issues they want to address within the nine months.

  I also have mentioned that the Independent Committee can always submit interim reports for issues that they believe have finished their work and let the Government take immediate action. I am very grateful to Mr Justice Lok, because he wants to really help Hong Kong as a whole to address and solve all these problems. He shares the same belief as I do, to ensure that we can do it as soon as possible. I must express my sincere gratitude to the three members of the Independent Committee. It is a big responsibility and challenging tasks within only nine months, but they all have the passion and the love for Hong Kong to be so courageous to take up this responsibility. I am really thankful to them. I take my hat off to them.

  Regarding the long-term housing issues for the victims and the families who suffer in this Tai Po big fire, of course, I am very concerned about the arrangements that may be made possible to take care of their needs, but they have very divergent needs, obviously, because we have so many families, and each family may have their own thinking. There have been a lot of views about what we can do, and I have explained them in my opening. What is important is to listen to what they want. I think they may want things very differently, and whether we will be able to have different options for different families to choose is important, so collecting views from them is very important. Everybody has a very good heart, trying to help them, but I think it will be up to them to tell us what they want, even though there may be different wants and different needs. At the same time, they are still undergoing a difficult period of big transition. While I ask the Task Force (Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements) to collect views, I think they have to do it in a very tactful manner. We do not want to upset the families while they are at this difficult time. There may be a process for the Task Force to go through to talk to the families in a tactful and right way at the right moment of time as well. That may take a little bit of time, but as I have always asked my people to do, we always want to finish all these things as soon as possible, because the sooner we address all these issues and problems, the quicker we can recover our normal life. I do remember the important message given by Dr CC Lam (Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Mental Health, Dr Lam Ching-choi) when he talked about the importance of mental health and psychological health, which is we should try to come back to normal, day-to-day life as soon as possible. That will be helping not just society but, most importantly, helping the victims and helping their families to go through this difficult time. We will work on that.

​反非法勞工行動拘十五人（附圖）,2025-12-12 19:55,2025-12-12 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200751.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十二月五日至昨日（十二月十一日）在全港多區，包括出入境管制站展開反非法勞工行動。截至昨日，行動中共拘捕十三名懷疑非法勞工及兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。

入境處調查人員於十二月九日在羅湖管制站進行的針對性行動中，截查多名訪港目的有可疑的入境旅客，並在其中一名內地男子身上檢獲一張懷疑偽造的建造業工人註冊證。該名四十二歲男子因涉嫌管有虛假文書和以訪客身份來港從事非法僱傭工作而被捕。

於其他反非法勞工行動，包括「曙光行動」、「促進行動」以及聯同香港警務處執行的「冠軍行動」中，調查人員搜查了多個目標地點，包括洗衣店、裝修中的單位及貨倉等，共拘捕十二名懷疑非法勞工及兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為五男七女，年齡介乎二十五至六十七歲，當中兩名女子持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為兩名男子，年齡分別為五十四及七十一歲。

有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。而任何人士如製造、管有或使用虛假文書，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判入獄十四年。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

15 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photos),2025-12-12 19:55,2025-12-12 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200752.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations, including an operation conducted at an immigration control point, from December 5 to yesterday (December 11). A total of 13 suspected illegal workers and two suspected employers were arrested as of yesterday.

  During the targeted operation to combat illegal workers conducted at the Lo Wu Control Point on December 9, ImmD investigators intercepted and examined several arriving passengers with suspicious purposes of visit . Among those intercepted, a Mainlander male was found in possession of a suspected forged Construction Worker Registration Card. The 42-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possessing a forged document and contravening his conditions of stay by taking up illegal employment in Hong Kong as a visitor.

  During other anti-illegal worker operations, including operations codenamed ""Twilight"" and ""Contribute"" and a joint operation with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Champion"", investigators raided multiple target locations including laundries, renovating flats, and warehouses. Twelve suspected illegal workers and two suspected employers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised five men and seven women, aged 25 to 67. Among them, two women were holders of a recognizance form, which prohibits them from taking any employment. Two men, aged 54 and 71, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested.

  The investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties. Moreover, any person who makes, possesses or uses a false instrument commits an offence and is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, subject to imprisonment for 14 years,"" an ImmD spokesman said.""

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."

FEHD takes enforcement action against sale of hairy crabs without permission,2025-12-12 19:47,2025-12-12 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200753.htm,"To safeguard food safety, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has long been committed to combating the illegal sale of hairy crabs, with a view to ensuring that hairy crabs on sale in the market comply with relevant requirements under the laws. The FEHD officers conducted a blitz operation yesterday (December 11), inspected a licensed general restaurant at Fuk Lo Tsun Road in Kowloon City and prosecuted the operator for suspected contravention of the Food Business Regulation (Cap. 132X) (the Regulation) by selling restricted food (hairy crabs) without permission.

Under the Regulation, save with the written permission of the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene (DFEH), no person shall sell any restricted foods, including shellfish. Operators selling hairy crabs shall obtain the Shell Fish (Hairy Crab) Permit or relevant written permission granted by the FEHD; or, if the shop already holds another relevant FEHD licence (such as a fresh provision shop licence) or operates a fish stall in a market managed by the FEHD, the operator must apply for written permission. Premises holding a permit or licence must, in accordance with the law, display the permit or licence prominently. If the operator sells only through online platforms, they must apply for an online sale of restricted food permit. The website or online platform account homepage selling hairy crabs must clearly display the permit information, such as the permit number, registered address, and the types of restricted foods approved for sale. The relevant regulatory condition also stipulates that hairy crabs for sale shall be obtained from a reliable and reputable source. A copy of the health certificate issued by the relevant authority and acceptable to the DFEH shall also be kept. Under the Regulation, any person who operates an unlicensed food business or sells restricted foods without permission commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and imprisonment for six months upon conviction.

The FEHD reminds the trade not to import or put on sale hairy crabs or other food with an unknown origin, and consumers should make purchases at reputable shops with the Shell Fish (Hairy Crab) Permit or relevant written permission granted by the FEHD.

If members of the public suspect that there are operators selling hairy crabs without the relevant permits/permissions or the hairy crabs are not accompanied by health certificates, they may make a report by calling the FEHD hotline at 2868 0000 or through email (enquiries@fehd.gov.hk)."
Labour Department completes territory-wide special enforcement operation,2025-12-12 18:59,2025-12-12 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200377.htm,"âA spokesperson for the Labour Department (LD) said today (December 12) that the LD completed a two-week special enforcement operation today, targeting building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding erected. The LD will continue to focus on inspecting the improvement progress of construction sites with violations detected and work sites where scaffold nets have been removed from the external walls of buildings.

During the special enforcement operation starting from November 28, the LD inspected 467 construction sites, with 249 written warnings and 112 improvement notices issued as well as 25 prosecutions initiated, which mainly involved the prohibition of smoking at sites, as well as violations such as failure to maintain fire escapes and fire-fighting appliances in good condition, unsafe working at height, and failure to provide personal protective equipment.

The LD will continue to follow up on the improvement progress of the construction sites with violations. If unsafe working conditions persist, the LD will take actions in accordance with the law. The LD will also continue to inspect work sites where scaffold nets have been removed from external walls of buildings. If work on external walls is still being carried out on scaffolds, the LD will notify relevant departments to follow up. If imminent risks such as objects falling from scaffolds are detected, the LD will take enforcement actions immediately, including issuing suspension notices and taking out prosecutions, without issuing prior warning.

The LD reiterated that contractors must strictly implement all site safety measures to ensure the occupational safety and health of employees. Under the general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, employers are obligated to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant legislation with serious circumstances are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years."

"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, dengue fever and chikungunya fever",2025-12-12 18:34,2025-12-12 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200687.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (December 12) reported the latest situation of dengue fever (DF) and chikungunya fever (CF).

Dengue fever
----------------

 From December 5 to yesterday (December 11), the CHP recorded one imported DF case. The patient had travelled to the Philippines during the incubation period.

 As of yesterday, 56 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. From January to July 2025, over four million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths have been reported in 97 countries/territories.

 DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India and Vietnam have each recorded over 100 000 cases so far this year; Malaysia and Thailand have each recorded over 40 000 cases; and Singapore has also recorded over 3 500 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded 3 558 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 47 cases were recorded in a week between November 24 and 30, with the highest number of cases recorded in Chaozhou and Shantou.

 Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHP'swebsite.

Chikungunya fever
-----------------------

As of 5pm today, no new cases of CF had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 79 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported.

Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. The CHP and the relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails. The CHP reiterated its appeal for the public to avoid entering the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

 The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373). All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

 Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

 TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

 Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


 âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

 The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
Two incoming passengers convicted and jailed for dealing with and possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and importing alternative smoking products (with photos),2025-12-12 18:30,2025-12-12 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200695.htm,"Two incoming passengers were sentenced to two months' imprisonment and four months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 respectively by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (December 12) for dealing with and possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, as well as for importing alternative smoking products, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO).

Customs officers intercepted a 32-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) on December 10 and seized about 20 600 duty-not-paid cigarettes and 11 400 alternative smoking products with an estimated market value of about $127,000 and a duty potential of about $68,000 from his personal baggage. He was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to three months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 in contravention of the DCO and was sentenced to two months' imprisonment in contravention of the IEO today. Parts of the two sentences run concurrently, making for a total of four months' imprisonment.

In addition, Customs officers intercepted a 21-year-old incoming male passenger at HKIA yesterday (December 11) and seized 5 200 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $23,000 and a duty potential of about $17,000 from his personal baggage. He was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to two months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 in contravention of the DCO today.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Under the IEO, a person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/en)."

另外，海關人員昨日（十二月十一日）在香港國際機場截查一名二十一歲抵港男旅客，並在他的個人行李內檢獲五千二百支未完稅香煙，市值約二萬三千元，應課稅值約一萬七千元，該名男旅客隨即被捕。他今日就違反《應課稅品條例》，被判處監禁兩個月及罰款一千元。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

根據《應課稅品條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

根據《進出口條例》，任何人進口另類吸煙產品即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Speech by SJ at Law Society of Hong Kong's Pro Bono and Community Service Award Presentation Ceremony 2025 (English only),2025-12-12 18:08,2025-12-12 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200667.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the Law Society of Hong Kong's Pro Bono and Community Service Award Presentation Ceremony 2025 today (December 12):

Chief Justice (Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal, Mr Andrew Cheung), President of the Law Society (President of the Law Society of Hong Kong, Mr Roden Tong), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. I am very honoured to join you here today at the Law Society Pro Bono and Community Service Award Ceremony 2025. This is an important annual event that I never miss. I would like to begin by extending my warmest congratulations to all the awardees.

  In the present context, the Latin phrase ""pro bono publico"" means ""providing free legal services for the public good"", in particular for those who cannot afford legal representation. As we all know, an essential element of the rule of law is that justice should be accessible to all. Access to justice is indeed a fundamental human right guaranteed by Article 35 of the Basic Law. However, in practice, access to justice will only be effective and meaningful if legal representation is available to all, but not just those who can afford instructing lawyers. This is why legal aid and pro bono legal services are essential to the maintenance of the rule of law.

  I am pleased to say that, in Hong Kong, we have a very strong tradition of providing legal aid and pro bono legal services. The response of the legal sector to the tragic fire in Tai Po provides the best evidence. To begin with, I must pay tribute to the Law Society's swift action in establishing the temporary panel under the Emergency Free Legal Helpline for Tai Po Tragic Fire to provide preliminary free legal advice to the public. On the other hand, the Legal Aid Department announced two days ago that it has established a dedicated task force and will implement a series of support measures to assist residents and other affected persons in applying for legal aid in accordance with the statutory requirements to handle litigation and related matters. Solicitors on the legal aid panel will be heavily involved in due course. In addition, the Judiciary has also announced that all potential legal proceedings, including probate proceedings, relating to the incident will be handled with priority and expeditiously through a series of facilitative measures. At this difficult time, the whole legal sector, including lawyers and judges, are standing together with the victims and all those affected. I would strongly encourage all those in need to make use of the legal services that I have just mentioned.

  Turning to community service, its scope is, of course, very wide. But I would like to highlight one particular type of community service which depends on lawyers and those who are legally trained. And that is rule of law education. To enhance the general public's awareness and general knowledge about the rule of law, and our legal and judicial system, is of crucial importance. In this respect, the Law Society has always been an invaluable partner to the Department of Justice.

  We are extremely grateful to the Law Society for its most helpful input and dedicated support, from providing constructive and practical ideas to assist in the formulation of our rule-of-law education programmes, to providing experienced and passionate members to serve as speakers and group leaders in seminars and mock trial activities that we organised as part of our rule-of-law education programmes. Without the staunch support of the Law Society, our programmes could not have been successful.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the provision of pro bono and community service ensures that the practice of law is not merely a means to enable lawyers to make a living. It enables lawyers to contribute in the building of a more fair and just society based on the rule of law, which indeed should be the ultimate objective of practicing law.

  The awards to be presented today not only serve as a recognition to the services provided by well-deserved members but also an encouragement to other members to take part. On this note, may I conclude by extending my congratulations to all the awardees once again. Thank you."

DH reminds public to receive COVID-19 vaccine in timely manner,2025-12-12 18:00,2025-12-12 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200646.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (December 12) reminded the public that it has been over five months since the last periodic upsurge of COVID-19activity cycle and COVID-19 vaccine should be received in a timely manner to reduce the risk of serious illness and death due to COVID-19.

  ""After the resumption of normalcy, Hong Kong experienced cycles of active periods of COVID-19 every six to nine months. Taking into account local and global epidemiological data in recent years, the CHP believes that COVID-19 has evolved into an endemic disease with a cyclical pattern. According to the CHP's analysis, the active periods are associated with the changes in the predominant circulating strains and a decline in herd immunity in Hong Kong.Since late March 2025, the local predominant strains have changed from KP.2 and KP.3 to NB.1.8.1. The latest surveillance data indicates that NB.1.8.1 and LP.8.1 are currently the co-circulating strains in the local community. Currently, the approved COVID-19 vaccines are expected to remain effective against NB.1.8.1 and LP.8.1. There is no evidence suggesting that NB.1.8.1 or LP.8.1 would cause a more severe disease. Nevertheless, the continuous evolving nature of the virus should not be taken lightly. The CHP will continue to closely monitor the situation regarding variant strains, in line with the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations, guarding against the possible emergence of more virulent or vaccine-mismatched strains of the virus,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

Under the currentGovernment's COVID-19 Vaccination Programme, individuals aged 6 months or above are eligible for free initial vaccine doses. High-risk priority groups can receive booster doses for free at least six months after the last dose or COVID-19 infection (whichever is later), regardless of the number of doses received previously.âHigh-risk priority groups include:

older adults aged 50 or above, including those living in residential care homes;
persons aged 18 to 49 years with underlying comorbidities;
persons with immunocompromising conditions aged 6 months and above;
pregnant women; and
healthcare workers.


The WHO and the Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases and the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases (Joint Scientific Committees) under the CHP earlier recommended either the JN.1 vaccine or the LP.8.1 vaccine as the vaccine choice in 2026. Given that the stock of JN.1 vaccines currently provided to toddlers is about to be exhausted, the Government has procured approximately 4 500 doses of Spikevax LP.8.1 vaccine for toddlers and children.

Eligible persons may continue to schedule a COVID-19 vaccine appointment via the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme booking system. Starting from 9am on December 18, toddlers and children aged 6 months to 11 years who schedule COVID-19 vaccine appointments via the booking system will be arranged to receive the LP.8.1 vaccine.

Toddlers and children may receive the COVID-19 vaccination at designated Maternal and Child Health Centres or Student Health Service Centres under the DH, Hong Kong Children's Hospital or designated Private Clinic COVID-19 Vaccination Station. Details are available on thewebpage.

The Government will continue assisting elderly people aged 60 or above living in the community to make COVID-19 vaccination bookings online. Relevant arrangements are outlined in an earlier press release.

As persons who contract influenza and COVID-19 at the same time are at a higher risk of severe complications and death, the CHP strongly recommends that high-risk individuals receive seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) and COVID-19 vaccination booster to reduce the risk of serious illness and death. The WHO has also pointed out that high-risk individuals should receive booster doses at appropriate times to mitigate the risk of serious illness and death.

For citizens who have not yet received SIV while receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, they can check with vaccination venues for arrangements for influenza vaccination. According to scientific evidence, COVID-19 vaccines and seasonal influenza vaccines can be administered at the same time to provide dual protection.

衞生署提醒市民應適時接種新冠疫苗,2025-12-12 18:00,2025-12-12 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200643.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月十二日）提醒，距離上次新冠活躍周期已超過五個月，市民應適時接種新冠疫苗，以減低感染新冠病毒後重症和死亡的風險。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「疫情復常後，香港每隔半年至九個月經歷一次新冠活躍周期。參考近年本地及全球的流行病學數據，中心認為新冠已演變成為一種有周期性的風土病。中心的分析顯示活躍周期與主流變異病毒株變化及社區群體免疫力下降有關。自二○二五年三月下旬開始，本地主流變異病毒株從KP.2及KP.3轉為NB.1.8.1。最新的監測數據顯示，NB.1.8.1和LP.8.1為現時本地共同流行的變異病毒株。目前獲批准使用的新冠疫苗預料仍能對NB.1.8.1及LP.8.1有效，且未有證據顯示NB.1.8.1或LP.8.1會引致更嚴重的疾病。值得注意的是，新冠變異病毒株不時改變，因此不能掉以輕心，中心會按世界衞生組織（世衞）的建議，繼續密切監察變異病毒株的情況，慎防日後可能出現毒性較強或與疫苗不匹配的變異病毒株。」

現時在政府新冠疫苗接種計劃下，6個月大或以上人士可免費接種初始劑次，而高風險優先組別人士不論過往已接種多少劑疫苗，於接種上一劑疫苗或感染新冠病毒（以較後者為準）最少六個月後，均可免費接種加強劑。現時高風險優先組別人士包括：

年屆50歲或以上包括居於院舍的長者；
18至49歲有長期病患的成年人；
6個月大或以上免疫力弱的人士；
孕婦；以及
醫護人員。


世衞和中心轄下的疫苗可預防疾病科學委員會和新發現及動物傳染病科學委員會（聯合科學委員會）早前建議於二○二六年可選用JN.1或LP.8.1譜系的新冠疫苗。因應現時供幼兒使用的JN.1疫苗庫存即將耗盡，政府已採購約4 500劑供幼兒及兒童使用的Spikevax LP.8.1疫苗。

合資格市民可繼續透過政府網上預約平台預約接種新冠疫苗。由十二月十八日上午九時起，經平台預約的6個月大至11歲的幼兒及兒童，將獲安排接種LP.8.1疫苗。

幼兒及兒童可到指定的衞生署母嬰健康院或學生健康服務中心、香港兒童醫院或指定私家診所新冠疫苗接種站接種新冠疫苗，詳情可參閱網頁。

政府將繼續協助六十歲或以上居於社區的長者於網上預約接種新冠疫苗，相關安排可參閱早前新聞稿。

鑑於同時患上流感及2019冠狀病毒病的患者會有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡，中心強烈呼籲高風險群組應盡快接種流感疫苗和新冠疫苗加強劑，以減低出現重症和死亡的風險。世衞亦指出，高風險人士應按時接種加強劑，以減低重症和死亡的風險。

市民接種新冠疫苗時，如仍未接種流感疫苗，可向接種場地查詢接種流感疫苗的安排。根據科學實證，新冠疫苗可與季節性流感疫苗同時接種，獲得雙重保護。

市民可瀏覽中心的新冠疫苗接種計劃網頁和流感網頁以了解更多詳情。"
Red tide sighted,2025-12-12 17:55,2025-12-12 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200651.htm," Two red tides were sighted during the past week, the Inter-departmental Red Tide Working Group reported today (December 12).

 On December 9, staff of the Environmental Protection Department spotted two red tides at Angler's Beach and Gemini Beaches. Both red tides have dissipated. No associated fish deaths have been reported as of today.

 A spokesman for the working group said, ""Both red tides were formed by Phaeocystis globosa, which is commonly found in Hong Kong waters. According to literature overseas, the algal species can produce foam that may affect fish.""

 The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) urged mariculturists at the Ma Wan fish culture zone to monitor the situation closely and increase aeration where necessary.

 Red tide is a natural phenomenon. The AFCD's proactive phytoplankton monitoring programme will continue to monitor red tide occurrences to minimise the impact on the mariculture industry and the public."

環境保護署人員十二月九日分別在釣魚灣泳灘及雙仙灣泳灘各發現一宗紅潮。兩宗紅潮已經消退，迄今並無收到相關的魚類死亡報告。

小組發言人說：「上述兩宗紅潮由常見於本港水域的球形棕囊藻組成。外國文獻指該藻類可能產生泡沫，或會影響魚類。」

漁農自然護理署（漁護署）已提醒馬灣魚類養殖區養魚戶留意魚排情況，並適時增氧。

紅潮的出現為自然現象，漁護署實施的浮游植物監測計劃將繼續主動監測紅潮出現的情況，以減低對本地海魚養殖業及市民可能造成的影響。"

The MOU marks the official establishment of the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar Site in Hong Kong and the Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve in Shanghai as sister wetlands under the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership Flyway Site Network.

Both the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar Site and the Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve are wetlands of international importance designated under the Convention on Wetlands. Located within the East Asian–Australasian Flyway (EAAF), the two wetlands serve as critical feeding and roosting habitats for waterbirds migrating along this flyway each year.

The MOU was signed by the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, Mr Mickey Lai, and Deputy Director of Shanghai Municipal Forestry Bureau Ms Xiong Jian and witnessed by representatives from the National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government.

The Deputy Director-General of the NFGA Mr Li Yunqing stated the Shanghai Dongtan and Hong Kong Mai Po, both located at critical nodes along the EAAF, have long served as vital ecological stopovers and energy replenishment stations. The successful union of the two protected areas as sister sites is a practical action by Shanghai and Hong Kong in actively fulfilling international environmental conventions and deeply engaging in terms of global ecological governance. This collaboration sets a good example for co-operative conservation efforts across the entire flyway.

Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Mr Wang Wei-ren said that the partnership between these two major protected areas as sister sites is a practical step in deepening co-operation between Shanghai and Hong Kong in the field of ecological and environmental protection. Both sides look forward to using this platform to more effectively address common challenges in migratory bird conservation, enhance the integrity and connectivity of wetland ecosystems, and jointly protect this precious lifeline.

Mr Lai pointed out through the MOU, both Shanghai and Hong Kong will leverage their respective strengths, actively strengthen exchanges on wetland conservation, promote the core concept of harmonious coexistence between humans and nature, and jointly contribute to ecological conservation efforts at the national and global levels.

Areas of co-operation between the two sides include key fields such as migratory waterbird research, co-ordinated habitat management, and public awareness and education."

Since the establishment of the infrastructure bond programme, the Government has issued infrastructure bonds totaling around HK$105.2 billion equivalent (up to March 31, 2025), with an aim of leveraging market capital to support infrastructure works projects and fostering the development of the bond market.

The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said, ""The Infrastructure Bond Report 2025 provides comprehensive information on the allocation of proceeds raised from the Infrastructure Bond Programme. The funds raised are credited to the Capital Works Reserve Fund for investment in infrastructure projects, such as accelerating the development of the Northern Metropolis, to facilitate the early completion of projects for the good of the economy and people's livelihood, thereby enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness. Infrastructure bonds also provide a safe and reliable investment option with steady returns for the public, as well as a greater 'sense of participation' and 'sense of gain' in support of infrastructure projects for Hong Kong's long-term development.""

The proceeds raised by the Government through issuances of infrastructure bonds have been fully allocated or earmarked for infrastructure projects, including 10 major infrastructure projects in the Northern Metropolis, such as San Tin Technopole (including the Loop), Kwu Tung North/Fanling North New Development Area (NDA), Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen NDA and Yuen Long South NDA.

消防處與醫院管理局合作推行「院前中風分流計劃」,2025-12-12 16:18,2025-12-12 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200540.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

消防處與醫院管理局（醫管局）今日（十二月十二日）宣布，將於十二月十五日上午八時三十分起在醫管局新界東醫院聯網（新界東聯網）及新界西醫院聯網（新界西聯網）推行「院前中風分流計劃」。

自二○二一年起，醫管局與消防處合作在全港推行「院前中風通報」機制。消防處救護人員會在患者送抵醫院前進行「院前中風評估」，利用標準化的醫療評估判斷患者有否出現懷疑急性中風症狀。若患者被評估為需要通報個案，救護人員會立即致電相關的公立醫院急症室，以便醫院的中風科團隊提前安排檢查及治療。

按照行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》中提出強化中風緊急救治服務網絡及進一步完善服務流程，從而提升中風病人存活率和功能恢復的目標，消防處與醫管局將加強合作，在新界東及新界西聯網率先推行「院前中風分流計劃」。在計劃下，經救護人員初步評估屬懷疑患有大血管閉塞的患者，將會直接送往所屬服務範圍的醫管局聯網指定醫院盡早接受治療，即沙田、大埔及北區的患者，會直接送往新界東聯網的威爾斯親王醫院；而位於屯門及元朗區的患者，則會直接送往新界西聯網的屯門醫院。透過在院前階段及早分流至具備相應治療服務的指定醫院，可避免患者需轉院及重複評估的情況，進一步縮短整體治療時間，為患者爭取更多黃金時間，減低腦損傷和長期殘疾的風險。

懷疑患有大血管閉塞的患者，在抵達公立醫院急症室後，會隨即接受相關檢查及診斷，如果證實患上大血管閉塞，中風科團隊會按照患者的臨床情況提供合適的治療，包括透過靜脈注射溶栓劑（溶栓治療）清除血塊；如果臨床條件合適，亦可接受動脈內取栓手術治療（取栓手術），以期盡快恢復血管向腦部供血。現時威爾斯親王醫院及屯門醫院除了提供溶栓治療外，亦提供取栓手術及相關配套服務，如果將懷疑患有大血管閉塞的中風患者直接送到兩間指定醫院，醫護人員可以盡快安排有關檢查及手術，縮短腦部缺血的時間，提升治療效果。至於其他聯網的中風患者，消防處的救護人員會繼續採用行之有效的「院前中風通報」機制，盡快通知及將患者送往公立醫院急症室接受治療。

醫管局發言人提醒市民，現時所有公立醫院急症室均可為中風患者安排合適的治療，市民如果懷疑自己或身邊人中風，應盡快到就近的急症室就診，醫護人員會立即安排相關評估和檢查。市民如果召喚消防處救護服務，亦應配合救護人員的專業評估及決定，救護人員會將患者送到合適的醫院作進一步診斷。

為確保「院前中風分流計劃」能夠順利推行，醫管局及消防處早前已進行多次演練。雙方將密切監察計劃進展及檢討成效，持續提升處理中風患者的效率，並積極考慮將計劃有序地推展至其他聯網。

中風大致可分為出血性中風及缺血性中風兩種不同類型，兩類型中風患者有不同的治療方法。就缺血性中風而言，目前所有公立醫院急症室均可24小時安排提供靜脈溶栓治療；而自本年三月起，威爾斯親王醫院、屯門醫院、瑪嘉烈醫院、伊利沙伯醫院、廣華醫院、瑪麗醫院及東區尤德夫人那打素醫院亦已提供24小時動脈內取栓手術服務，透過服務網絡全天候支援全港各區的中風患者。"
Fire Services Department and Hospital Authority to launch Pre-hospital Stroke Diversion Scheme,2025-12-12 16:18,2025-12-12 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200541.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

TheFire Services Department(FSD)and the Hospital Authority (HA) announced today (December 12) that the Pre-hospital Stroke Diversion Scheme (Primary Diversion Scheme) will be launched starting from 8.30am on December 15 in the New Territories East Cluster (NTEC) and the New Territories West Cluster (NTWC) of the HA.

Since 2021, the HA and the FSD have collaborated to implement the Pre-hospital Stroke Notification mechanism on a territory-wide basis. The FSD's ambulance personnel will perform a pre-hospital stroke assessment before patients arrive at the hospital, utilising standardised medical evaluations to determine if the patient exhibits suspected acute stroke symptoms. In case a patient is assessed as requiring notification, the ambulance personnel will immediately call the Accident and Emergency Department (AED) of the public hospital concerned, enabling the hospital's stroke team to make advance arrangements for examination and treatment.

In line with the objectives set out by the Chief Executive in the 2025 Policy Address on strengthening the emergency stroke service network and further optimising service workflows to improve patients' survival rate and functional recovery, the FSD and the HA will strengthen collaboration and initiate to implement the Primary Diversion Scheme in the NTEC and the NTWC. Under the scheme, patients preliminarily assessed by ambulance personnel as having suspected large vessel occlusion (LVO) will be directly conveyed to designated HA hospitals within the service catchment areas for early treatment. Specifically, patients from Sha Tin, Tai Po and North districts will be taken to Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) in the NTEC, while those from Tuen Mun and Yuen Long districts will be sent directly to Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH) in the NTWC. By triaging patients promptly at the pre-hospital stage and conveying them directly to designated hospitals capable of providing appropriate treatment services, the scheme can avoid the need for inter-hospital transfers and repeated assessments, further shortening the overall time for treatment, gaining more ""golden time"" for patients and reducing their risk of brain damage and long-term disability.

Suspected LVO patients will receive immediate examinations and diagnosis upon arrival at the public hospital AED. If LVO is confirmed, the stroke team will provide suitable treatments based on the patient's clinical condition, which may include intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) to dissolve blood clots. If clinically appropriate, patients may also receive intra-arterial thrombectomy (IAT) surgery to restore blood flow to the brain as quickly as possible. Currently, PWH and TMH offer both IVT and IAT along with related support services. By directing suspected LVO patients to these two designated hospitals, healthcare staff can promptly arrange necessary examinations and procedures, thereby reducing the duration of cerebral ischemia and improving treatment outcomes. For stroke patients in other Clusters, the FSD's ambulance personnel will continue to swiftly convey patients to the public hospital AED for treatment in accordance with the established Pre-hospital Stroke Notification mechanism.

The HA spokesperson reminded the public that all public hospital AEDs are capable of providing appropriate treatment for stroke patients. If individuals suspect themselves or someone nearby are suffering from stroke, they should promptly attend the nearest AED, where healthcare staff will arrange necessary assessments and examinations. Members of the public calling the FSD's ambulance service for assistance are also advised to co-operate with the professional assessments and judgments conducted by the ambulance personnel, who will convey patients to a suitable hospital for further diagnosis.

To ensure the smooth implementation of the Primary Diversion Scheme, the HA and the FSD have conducted multiple drills in advance. Both parties will closely monitor the progress of the Scheme and review its effectiveness to continuously enhance the efficiency of stroke patient management and actively consider extending the Scheme to other Clusters in an orderly manner.

Strokes can be generally classified into two types, namely hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke. Treatment approaches differ for patients with each type. For ischemic strokes, all public hospital AEDs currently offer 24-hour IVT services. Since March of this year, PWH, TMH, Princess Margaret Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Kwong Wah Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital, and Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital have also been providing 24-hour IAT services, supporting stroke patients across Hong Kong through a comprehensive service network."

Grading of beach water quality released,2025-12-12 16:00,2025-12-12 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200350.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (December 12) released the latest grading of water quality for six gazetted beaches that are open all year round for swimming.

  Four beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1), and two as Fair (Grade 2).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Golden Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Silverstrand Beach




Grade 2 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Lido Beach




  Compared with the grading released last week, there was no change in the grading for these beaches.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on December 11 to noon today (December 12), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 253 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 187 927 samples of food imported from Japan (including 121 688 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 41 764 samples of local catch respectively.

Hong Kong Customs alerts public to unsafe magnetic wireless charging stand (with photo),2025-12-12 15:40,2025-12-12 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200485.htm,"Hong Kong Customs today (December 12) alerted members of the public to a potential thermal burn injury posed by one model of a magnetic wireless charging stand (charging stand), and advised them to stop using the products.

Customs earlier received information alleging that a charging stand had an overheating problem, and then test-purchased that model of charging stand for safety testing. Testing results revealed that when using the wireless charging function, if a metal foreign object is placed between the charging stand and the device being charged, the temperature of the foreign object could reach 148.1 degrees Celsius, exceeding the permissible limit of 85 degrees C. Overheating was also observed in the charging stand. Therefore, the product did not comply with relevant international product safety standards, and is suspected to be in contravention of the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance (CGSO).

Customs officers later conducted an operation and searched the premises of the retailer involved in the case. No charging stand concerned was found. A prohibition notice was then served to the subject retailer, prohibiting the sale of the suspected unsafe charging stand concerned.

Furthermore, Customs officers have conducted spot checks and inspections in various districts and have not found any sales of the charging stand concerned so far. The investigation is ongoing.

Customs reminds members of the public to adhere to following safety tips when purchasing and using charging stands:


Purchase charging stands manufactured by reputable brands and equipped with short-circuit protection devices, as well as overcharging, overcurrent and overheated battery temperature protection devices, and choose charger cables produced by original manufacturers;




Read the user manual before using the charging stand to understand how to use it properly;




Ensure the charging stand is placed in a well-ventilated area to avoid obstructing heat dissipation from the charging stand and to minimise the risk of a short circuit. Devices being charged should not be placed near inflammable substances such as clothes;




Keep the charging stand and chargers clean, and do not place any objects between the charging stand and the device being charged during wireless charging;




Avoid prolonged charging. Once the device being charged is fully charged, unplug it to prevent the charging stand from overheating and causing accidents;




Place the charging stand and chargers in use within sight;




Do not use the charging stand to charge more than one device at the same time to avoid overloading and combustion; and




If the charging stand is found to be damaged, or is overheating or making any abnormal noise/smell/vibration, stop using it immediately and unplug it.


Customs is committed to the protection of consumer interests and regularly conducts spot checks and safety tests on consumer goods to ensure that they are reasonably safe for use by consumers.
 
Customs also reminds traders to comply with the statutory requirements of the CGSO to protect the safety of consumers. Under the CGSO, it is an offence to supply, manufacture or import into Hong Kong consumer goods unless the goods comply with the general safety requirements for consumer goods. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for one year on first conviction, and $500,000 and imprisonment for two years on subsequent conviction.

Members of the public may report any suspected violations of the CGSO to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)."
香港海關提醒市民留意一款不安全磁吸無線充電座（附圖）,2025-12-12 15:40,2025-12-12 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200484.htm,"香港海關今日（十二月十二日）提醒市民留意一款有過熱及引致燒傷潛在危險的磁吸無線充電座，並呼籲市民停用有關產品。

海關早前接獲舉報指一款充電座有過熱問題，遂試購該款充電座作安全測試，結果發現該款充電座在使用無線充電功能時，如有金屬外物放置於充電座和被充電裝置之間，該外物的溫度測試結果達攝氏148.1度，超過允許限值（即攝氏85度），充電座亦會出現過熱情況，未能通過燒傷測試，因而不符合國際相關安全標準，涉嫌違反《消費品安全條例》（《條例》）。

海關人員其後採取行動，搜查涉案的一間零售商，行動中未再有發現該款充電座。人員已向有關零售商發出禁制通知書，禁止繼續出售該款懷疑不安全的充電座。

此外，海關人員亦到全港各區進行巡查，暫沒有再發現該款充電座出售。案件仍在調查中。

海關建議市民，於選購及使用充電座時，應注意以下安全事項：


選購由商譽良好的品牌原廠生產並設有短路保護裝置的充電座，包括防止過度充電、過高電流及過熱電池溫度保護裝置，以及配置原廠正貨的充電線；




使用充電座前，須先閱讀說明書，以了解正確的使用方法；




將充電座放置於空氣流通的地方充電，以避免阻礙充電座散熱，增加充電座短路着火的風險，正在充電的裝置亦不應擺近衣物等易燃物品；




保持充電座及供電裝置清潔及切勿在無線充電期間放置任何物件於充電座及被充電裝置之間；




避免長時間充電。當被充電裝置完全充電後，應拔走插頭，避免充電座過熱而導致意外；




充電座及供電裝置在使用時應放在視線範圍內；




避免使用充電座同時為多於一個裝置充電，以免充電座超出負荷，引致燃燒；及




若發現充電座損壞、散發高熱、有異常噪音／氣味／震動，應立即停用，並把充電座及電源拔掉。


海關一直致力保障消費者的權益，不時在市場巡查及抽取消費品樣本進行安全測試，以確保消費品達到合理的安全程度。

海關同時提醒商戶，須遵從《條例》的規定，以保障消費者安全。根據《條例》，任何人士不得供應、製造或進口消費品，除非該等消費品符合《條例》的一般安全規定。違例者首次定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁一年，而其後各次定罪則最高可被判罰款五十萬元及監禁兩年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/）舉報懷疑違反《條例》的活動。"

Opening remarks by SITI at Hong Kong Science Summit (English only) (with photo),2025-12-12 10:56,2025-12-12 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200268.htm,"  Following are the opening remarks by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, at the Hong Kong Science Summit today (December 12):

Professor Dennis Lo (President of the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you all today at the Hong Kong Science Summit. This summit gathers distinguished scientists and academic leaders from around the world to exchange views on the latest global scientific developments. Science and technology are instrumental for scientific progress. I am glad that we are here together to build a better future for the younger generations and make Hong Kong, and even this world, a better place in our pursuit for scientific discoveries and technological breakthroughs.

  In recent years, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has been investing vigorously in innovation and technology (I&T). With three major I&T parks and five key research and development institutions as the framework, we are poised to promote the co-ordinated development of, and positive interaction among, the research and development in the upstream, technology transfer in the midstream and development of industry in the downstream. We hope to leverage Hong Kong's traditional strengths in research and development to drive industrial innovation and build a healthy I&T ecosystem.

  Our efforts are gradually bearing fruit. With the staunch support of our country, as well as our close collaboration with neighboring cities, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster has ranked first for the first time in the 2025 Global Innovation Index Ranking of the World's Top 100 Innovation Clusters. Riding on our tremendous potential in technology development, Hong Kong also rose to rank fourth globally in digital competitiveness in the latest World Digital Competitiveness Ranking 2025. These achievements are a testament to our dedication and the innovative spirit of our city, laying a robust foundation for high-quality development.

  To keep up the momentum, we are expediting the development of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen I&T Park in the Loop, with a view to joining hands with Shenzhen to create an international talent hub. Together with Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport, the Hong Kong Park in the Loop would further propel our I&T development. The Government has also been bolstering its efforts to nurture local talents and attract overseas and Mainland professionals. The existing two InnoHK research clusters, namely AIR@InnoHK and Health@InnoHK, have already pooled over 3000 experts from around the globe. Building on the success of the two clusters, we are taking forward the establishment of the third InnoHK research cluster, namely SEAM@InnoHK. This new cluster will focus on research areas such as sustainable development, energy, advanced manufacturing, and materials, and is expected to broaden our high-calibre talent pool. We have also launched the $3billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme in September this year to provide funding support to universities in attracting international top-notch scientific researchers to Hong Kong, so as to spearhead basic research in frontier technologies. These recent measures signify our commitment to developing Hong Kong as an international I&T centre and talent hub.

  Hong Kong's development is underpinned by our unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, which makes us the only world city which enjoys both the China advantage and the global advantage. With the enormous opportunities arising from the development of the Greater Bay Area, we are at the dawn of an unprecedented golden era for Hong Kong's I&T development. Nurturing young talents is vital to bringing Hong Kong's I&T development to a whole new level. The Hong Kong Academy of Sciences, including its Hong Kong Young Academy of Sciences, has been our close partner in empowering the next generation of scientists. As this year marks an important milestone of the 10th anniversary of the Academy, let us continue to join hands in building a vibrant I&T ecosystem and nurturing more talents who will contribute to the high-quality development of both Hong Kong and the country.

  In closing, may I wish you all a fruitful and inspiring experience at the summit. Thank you."
