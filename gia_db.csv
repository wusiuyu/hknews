Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-07 22:40,2025-12-07 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700783.htm,"  The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
------------------------------------

  For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3 billion as of 1pm today (December 7). In addition to the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.3 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

  The Government earlier announced that the Support Fund will provide a living allowance to each affected household. As of today, 1 273 cases have been processed. The living allowance is increased from $50,000 to $100,000 and will be disbursed in phases. In addition, the Support Fund will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 90 cases have been processed.

  In addition, the Government has so far disbursed an emergency subsidy of $10,000 to 1 931 households.

  Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 970 affected households, and more than 4 900 residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government. Those not yet in touch with the SWD are advised to leave their contact information by calling 182 183 as soon as possible.

Accommodation support
------------------------------

  As of this morning, a total of 1 408 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 2 702 residents have moved into transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society. Moreover, the Tai Po District Office continues to operate a temporary shelter at Tai Po Community Centre, which remains open to residents in need. The other temporary shelter at Tung Cheong Street Community Hall will remain in operation until the existing users have relocated to arranged emergency accommodations.

Relief supplies and donations
------------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received about 1 600 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items to places in need in phases. So far, over 4 800 pieces of donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Handling of reported missing persons
---------------------------------------------

  The Police have completed searches inside all seven buildings. Officers from the Disaster Victim Identification Unit (DVIU) continued to search the area around the buildings and near the collapsed scaffolding today, which had been confirmed as safe. No human remains were found, and the number of the deceased remains at 159. The Police are contacting the families of the missing persons and those who have preliminarily identified the deceased through photographs to arrange for them to undergo DNA oral swab sampling in batches starting tomorrow (December 8) for scientific identification of the deceased.

Investigations
-----------------

  The Fire Services Department officers assisted the DVIU in removing accumulated water from the elevator shafts of Wang Kin House, Wang Tai House, Wang Cheong House and Wang Shing House to facilitate the search operations.

Regulation and inspection work
--------------------------------------

  The emergency maintenance contractors co-ordinated by the Housing Department have largely completed the clearance of miscellaneous items at the surroundings of the buildings at Wang Fuk Court today. With the protective nets removed from the four Home Ownership Scheme courts, namely Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po, On Kay Court in Kwun Tong, Sui Wo Court in Sha Tin and Ching Lai Court in Sham Shui Po, as well as Fung Wah Estate in Chai Wan under the Tenants Purchase Scheme, the Independent Checking Unit (ICU) of the Housing Bureau has requested registered inspectors to arrange for contractors to check on the conditions of the scaffoldings and remove waste and miscellaneous items to ensure safety on-site. The ICU will continue to conduct inspections and monitor the situations.

  Regarding the order to remove scaffold nets issued by the Buildings Department (BD), as of 6pm today, 224 private buildings have had their scaffold nets removed from the external walls. Four cases undergoing removal work have requested an extension of time, and the BD has accepted their applications. It is expected that the work will be finished within this week. The removal work of scaffold nets from the remaining two private buildings has been affected by ongoing contractual disputes between the contractors and the incorporated owners (the disputes existed prior to the Tai Po fire). The BD has arranged for government contractors to carry out the work and will recover the costs later. In addition, the Architectural Services Department has completed the removal of scaffold nets at the government buildings under its purview before the deadline.

  The BD strives to announce a new set of arrangements within this week requiring the scaffold nets used at construction sites to be sampled on-site and certified as compliant with the relevant standards prior to installation so that the relevant external wall work can resume as soon as possible.

  The 5 000 training places of Multi-skilled/Skill Enhancement courses reserved by the Construction Industry Council for workers affected by the suspension of repair work on external walls (trades including plumbing, window framing, painting and decoration, plastering, and bamboo scaffolding) will be open for application tomorrow. The courses are tuition-free. Depending on the specific trade courses and training hours, workers who complete the training and obtain qualifications can receive a maximum subsidy ranging from $14,000 to $19,000.

  The Labour Department (LD) continues to inspect fire protection facilities and the fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding to ensure the occupational safety of workers. As of 4pm today, the LD has inspected 332 construction sites, issued a total of 170 written warnings and 95 improvement notices, and taken out 25 prosecutions."

政府公布跟進大埔火災最新情況,2025-12-07 20:55,2025-12-07 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700722.htm,"政府就大埔宏福苑火災成立的三個工作組——調查及規管工作組、緊急支援及募捐工作組，以及應急住宿安排工作組——正全力持續跟進火災的支援、善後及調查事宜，詳情如下：

經濟及福利援助
———————

截至今日（十二月七日）下午一時，政府成立的「大埔宏福苑援助基金」已收到的外界捐款約30億元，連同政府投入的三億元啓動資金，基金總額約為33億元，會用在協助居民重建家園，是長期和持續的支援。

政府早前宣布基金會向每戶受影響家庭發放生活津貼，截至今日已處理1 273宗個案；生活津貼金額已由五萬元增至十萬元，政府會陸續發放有關款項。另外，基金會就每名死者向家屬發放20萬元慰問金及五萬元殮葬金，截至今日已處理90宗個案。

此外，政府至今已向1 931戶派發一萬元應急補助金。

社會福利署（社署）社工目前已接觸超過1 970個受影響住戶，為超過4 900名居民登記「一戶一社工」的跟進服務。社署會與受影響住戶保持聯繫，為他們提供一切所需協助，並全力支援政府的善後工作。尚未與社署聯絡的居民，請盡快致電182 183提供聯絡方法。

住宿援助
————

截至今日上午，共有1 408名居民入住由民政及青年事務局協調的青年宿舍／營舍或酒店房間；另有2 702名居民入住房屋局的過渡性房屋或香港房屋協會項目的單位。此外，大埔民政事務處現維持一所位於大埔社區中心的臨時庇護中心對外開放，供有需要人士使用；另一所位於東昌街社區會堂的臨時庇護中心，則會繼續運作至所有使用者全部遷往經安排的應急住宿為止。

物資援助／捐獻
———————

政府與資訊科技業界構建的物資捐獻網上平台繼續運作，團體及市民可於平台登記可捐贈的物資。政府至今共收到接近1 600個登記，其中約三成由機構提出，而餘下的由市民個人提出。已登記可捐獻物品種類涵蓋食品及飲品、衣物、日常生活用品、寢具、電器等多個類別。政府正透過相關政策局、政府部門和服務團體掌握居民的實際需要後進行物資配對工作，以便陸續把適用物資派送往有需要的地點。至今已有超過4 800件涵蓋不同類別的物資配送至多個地點。物資配對和分發工作會持續進行。

處理報稱失聯人士個案
——————————

警方已完成所有七幢大廈內部範圍的搜索工作。「災難遇害者辨認組」人員今日繼續在已確定安全的大廈外圍及倒塌棚架附近進行搜索，暫未有發現遺骸，死者數目維持159人。警方正聯絡失聯人士及已憑相片初步辨認遺體的家屬，安排他們由明日（十二月八日）開始分批進行脫氧核糖核酸口腔拭子採樣，以作科學鑑定辨別遺體身分。

調查工作
————

消防處人員協助「災難遇害者辨認組」抽走宏建閣、宏泰閣、宏昌閣及宏盛閣升降機槽內積水，以便進行搜查工作。

規管巡查
————

房屋署統籌的緊急維修承建商今日已大致完成清理宏福苑樓宇外圍雜物的工作。四個居屋屋苑（深水埗怡安閣、觀塘安基苑、沙田穗禾苑、深水埗清麗苑）和一個租置屋邨（柴灣峰華邨）完成拆除棚網後，房屋局獨立審查組（審查組）要求註冊檢驗人員安排承建商檢查棚架狀況、清除廢料及雜物，以確保現場環境安全。審查組會繼續巡查及監察情況。

就屋宇署發出的移除棚網命令，截至今日下午六時，224幢私人樓宇的外牆棚網已經移除，尚有四宗申請延期的個案正在進行工程，屋宇署已接受其延期申請，預計可於本周內完成。其餘兩幢私人樓宇，由於承建商與法團存在已久的合約糾紛一直未能解決（糾紛在大埔火災前已出現），影響了移除棚網的工作，屋宇署已安排政府承建商先進行所需工程，日後追回費用。此外，建築署已在限期前完成移除轄下政府建築物的棚網。

屋宇署爭取本星期內公布一套新的安排，要求工地使用的棚網在上架前就地採樣及核實是否符合標準，以便有關外牆工程可盡早恢復。

建造業議會為受暫停外牆工程影響的工人（工種包括水喉、窗框、髹漆及裝飾工、泥水，以及竹棚架）而預留的5 000個「一專多能／技術提升」培訓名額，明日（十二月八日）開始接受報名。課程免費，按不同工種的培訓課程及時數，工人完成訓練並考取資格，可獲津貼最多14,000元至19,000元不等。

勞工處繼續巡查設有大型棚架的樓宇維修工程工地的防火設施及火災應變安排，以保障工人的職業安全。截至今日下午四時，勞工處已巡查332個建築地盤，共發出170份書面警告及95張敦促改善通知書，並提出25宗檢控。"

CFS urges public not to consume a batch of imported canned shredded pork and preserved vegetable found with possibly excessive Sulfamethazine,2025-12-07 19:35,2025-12-07 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700659.htm,"  The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (December 7) urged the public not to consume a batch of imported canned shredded pork and preserved vegetable, as the product was found to possibly contain an excessive amount of Sulfamethazine, a veterinary drug residue. The trade should stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately if they possess it.

  Product details are as follows:

Product name: Ma Ling Shredded Pork and Preserved Vegetable
Brand: Ma Ling
Place of origin: China
Net weight: 240 grams
Best-before date: April 7, 2028
Distributor: Champion Fair Limited

  A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS noted a notification from the Macao authority that the above-mentioned product was detected with an excessive amount of Sulfamethazine. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately followed up. A preliminary investigation found that the above-mentioned distributor had imported into Hong Kong the affected batch of the product concerned.""

  The distributor concerned has stopped sales, removed from shelves the affected batch of the product, and initiated a recall according to the CFS's instructions. Members of the public may call the distributor's hotline at 2766 0128 during office hours for enquiries about the recall.

  ""Sulfamethazine is a sulfonamide antimicrobial drug. According to the detected level of the veterinary drug residue found by the relevant authority in the sample concerned, occasional consumption will not cause adverse health effect. However, consumption on a long-term basis may cause hypersensitivity and damage to the urinary system,"" the spokesman added.

  The spokesman urged members of the public who had bought the affected batch of the product to stop consuming it. The trade should also stop using or selling the product concerned immediately.

  The CFS has alerted the trade to the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. An investigation is ongoing."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-12-07 18:15,2025-12-07 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700583.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月七日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得78宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，10宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

鑑於近期部分確診個案報稱曾在青衣自然徑行山期間被蚊叮咬，中心評估該徑風險較高。中心繼續呼籲近期曾在青衣北一帶活動或在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電早前設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。熱線會繼續由上午九時至下午八時運作。中心在上月底亦已透過基層醫療署通知葵青區內約130名基層醫療醫生，呼籲他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。

特別針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾、以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持分者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

另外，就日前公布的一宗本地個案（涉及一名居於上環的23歲女子），流行病學調查仍然繼續進行。

中心繼續呼籲在上環皇后大道西（近摩利臣街和荷李活道一帶）居住或上班的市民，如於十一月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員會繼續接觸上述地點的市民，提醒他們留意有否相關病徵和注意家居環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過於上環文娛中心正門入口處設立的醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於上述受影響地區進行上門探訪，為逾2 700名在當區工作或居住的市民進行評估，而過去兩日未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。中心已為兩名早前出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查，其中一人的樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性，另一人的樣本正等候結果。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-07 18:15,2025-12-07 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700585.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 7), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 78 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 10 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  As some confirmed CF cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considered the trails to be a higher-risk area. The CHP continued to urge individuals who have recently visited the Tsing Yi North area or hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which was set up earlier. The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. In late November, the CHP also informed approximately 130 primary care doctors in Kwai Tsing District through the Primary Healthcare Commission, urging them to closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

  Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department and Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

   Meanwhile, regarding the recently announced local case involving a 23-year-old female living in Sheung Wan, the epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

  The CHP continued to urge the members of the public residing and working at Queen's Road West (near Morrison Street and Hollywood Road) who experienced a fever, rash or joint pain on or after November 15 to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately. CHP officers continued to reach out to individuals in the aforementioned locations to remind individuals to be aware of relevant symptoms and to maintain good environmental hygiene in their households.

  As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 2 700 individuals residing or working in the district through the health consultation booth at the main entrance of the Sheung Wan Civic Centre, its enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past two days. Two individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests. One of them tested negative for the chikungunya virus, and the result for the other individual is pending.

  Furthermore, the FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Hong Kong Customs seizes live turtles of suspected scheduled endangered species (with photos),2025-12-07 16:01,2025-12-07 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700445.htm,"âHong Kong Customs detected a smuggling case on December 5 involving a cross-boundary private car at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Hong Kong Port and seized 42 live turtles of suspected scheduled endangered species, with a total estimated value of about $420,000.

Based on risk assessment, Customs intercepted an outgoing private car declaring as empty, at the HZMB Hong Kong Port on December 5. Upon inspection, customs officers found 42 live turtles of suspected scheduled endangered species placed at the boot.

A 33-year-old male driver was arrested and charged with one count of attempting to export unmanifested cargo and one count of attempting to export a species under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (December 8).

Customs will continue to combat cross-boundary smuggling activities with firm enforcement action based on risk assessment and intelligence analysis.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Under the Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants Ordinance, any person importing, exporting or possessing specimens of endangered species not in accordance with the Ordinance commits an offence and will be liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for 10 years upon conviction with the specimens forfeited.

Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

海關會繼續透過風險評估和情報分析嚴厲執法，打擊跨境走私活動。

走私屬嚴重罪行，根據《進出口條例》，任何人輸入或輸出未列艙單貨物，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

根據《保護瀕危動植物物種條例》，任何人如非按照《條例》規定進出口或管有瀕危物種均屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一千萬元及監禁十年，有關物品亦會被充公。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑走私活動。"

Remarks by SLW at media session regarding facilitation measures for voters of 2025 Legislative Council General Election,2025-12-07 14:33,2025-12-07 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700411.htm,"  The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, met the media today (December 7) regarding facilitation measures for voters of 2025 Legislative Council General Election, after viewing the Outreach Polling Station for Residential Care Homes at Kwu Tung North Multi-welfare Services Complex. Following are Mr Sun's remarks at the media session:

Reporter: How does these Outreach Polling Stations benefit the elderly voters?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: It is the first time we set up Outreach Polling Stations in three destinations in Hong Kong. This one in Kwu Tung is the biggest one. Alice (the Permanent Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Ms Alice Lau) and I visited this polling station this morning. The operation and the whole procedure are very smooth. We spoke to elderly people as well as workers here, all of them expressed great satisfaction with the arrangement. They are very happy with the convenience provided to them. It's saving them time.

  For those who are on wheelchairs, it is a hugely easier journey. Instead of traveling out and then going back to homes, they only have to take the lift on their wheelchairs, just take them a few minutes to complete the whole procedure of voting. So it's a very smooth and successful operation. Thank you very much.

​勞工及福利局局長就立法會換屆選舉便利投票措施及宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒談話內容,2025-12-07 14:32,2025-12-07 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700356.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十二月七日）上午到訪古洞北福利服務綜合大樓視察院舍外展投票站後，就立法會換屆選舉便利投票措施及宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒的談話內容：

勞工及福利局局長：早晨。今早我和常秘（勞工及福利局常任秘書長劉焱）特意來到古洞這個很大的老人院院舍集群，看看我們院舍外展投票站（外展票站）的運作。這次一共有三個設在院舍的外展票站，古洞北福利服務綜合大樓是最大的一個。我今日所見運作很流暢。剛剛我也和票站同事聊過天，他們安排由最低層開始，逐一安排長者投票，同時也安排員工來投票。長者會先投票，實際運作遠比他們原定計劃更流暢、更快速。票站裏有兩個投票格，坐輪椅的長者是用家，而為他們推輪椅的是院舍員工。他們可以輪流投票，由長者先投，整個流程很流暢。我剛剛和長者們聊天，他們均覺得很方便。如果沒有這個外展票站，你可以想像他們便要我們安排車，或要聯絡員工特地陪伴他們，尤其他們都登記住在不同地區，距離很遠，他們會辛苦很多。如果在這裏投票便很簡單，我們先安排好時間，然後提早安排長者坐升降機下來在大堂後面位置等待。他們可以舒適地等候入內投票，時間很快，約數分鐘便可完成整個流程。有些人跟我分享，他投票後便可去喝茶、做自己的事，整個流程非常好。

記者：局長，其實今次選舉多了很多便利長者投票的措施，包括是外展票站，勞福局另外亦有為院舍提供資助，讓他們安排車接送院友去投票。為甚麼會有這樣的想法？此外，就宏福苑火災，你昨天在電台節提及過，「一戶一社工」是一個不設限期的服務。有些前線社工反映，他們的工作量比較難負擔，本來跟進的個案工作都未能處理。請問是否真的會無限期推行？

勞工及福利局局長：第一，大家可以看到我們在這次選舉中比以往提供更多的便利安排，主要是希望盡可能方便願意投票的市民。尤其是我們明白住在院舍、日間老人中心的長者，很多都是行動未如我們般便捷，若我們能幫助他們便更好。因此，我們安排了三個外展票站。此外，無論是長者中心、殘疾人士地區支援中心或精神健康綜合社區中心，所有的中心都參加了我們便利投票津貼20,000元的安排，總數共有261個中心參加，目的都是希望提供便利。

至於「一戶一社工」，大家都知道，自宏福苑火災後，每一個住在宏福苑的住戶，或其他受影響的居民，他們的需要都不盡相同。如果有了「一戶一社工」，便可以因應他個人的需求，讓社工擔當一個特定的對口，主要是方便了他們做工夫。他們的需求各種各樣都有，有些是相對簡單，亦有些是相對複雜。但大家都要明白．在火災之後，全香港人都展現了大愛的精神。當然，我們社工都各自有工作，但即使有工作，若我們可以在這次火災中貢獻自己的力量，我們的同事都是願意去做的。我們表示「一戶一社工」沒有限期的原因，是基於每戶的需要都不同。有些戶數可能過了一段時間，基本上便不太需要社工幫助，大家可以保持聯絡。但確實有些戶數，尤其是家裏不幸有人身故的，或者健康狀況及家庭狀況風險較高的，那些跟進工作便很長遠。當然，「一戶一社工」的負責社工是最前線的接觸點，但舉例有些專業的服務，或其他不是他自己可以單獨提供的服務，是有整個團隊去支援。無論是醫管局、或我們社福系統裡，都有很多同事會支援他。我們相信隨着「一戶一社工」的落實，是可以實實在在幫助宏福苑的居民。

記者：請問三個外展票站分別有多少院舍院友和員工已經登記為選民？此外，局長在接受其他媒體訪問時提及，相信這次的外展票站會廣受歡迎。請問投票率達多少才為受歡迎？若措施受歡迎或投票率達到某一個水平，會否考慮將院舍外展票站恆常化？

勞工及福利局局長：我們統計過，總共約有350多名選民將其投票地點轉到三個外展票站，當中院友是佔多數，共有約200多名，員工則有百多名。當中，最多人登記到古洞外展票站。按我們初步掌握的數字，約有200多名選民將自己的投票地點轉到古洞的外展票站，當中也以院友為多，約130名；員工則有約90多名，所以這裡確實是方便他們。依我現場所見，轉過來的院友和員工，都有很強的投票意欲，當然亦要參考最後的統計數據。但以今日我實地視察的結果，是很順暢、很成功的。無論是院友或員工，在聊天期間都表示方便了很多，長者無需坐兩程車來回。他投完票後，便可以自己做回今天的活動；有些行動好一點的，便可出外喝茶。員工亦然，方便了不少。至於將來如何，我們當然會看選舉管理委員會（選管會）的意見，但是我們一定會在檢討方面向選管會反映今次外展票站的效果。依我今日所見，外展票站的效果非常好，廣受院友和員工的歡迎。

記者：請問如何確保院舍院友投票的自主權及保密性？此外，「一戶一社工」方面，有些社工在社交媒體表示壓力很大，沒法處理原本跟進的個案。請問局方有甚麼支援，以及如何確保他們本身跟進的個案不會受影響？有些立法會議員亦說，本身災民的情緒都很不穩定，「一戶一社工」再向他們提供一些選舉的資訊，質疑這個做法是否人性化。你認為這個做法是否人性化？

勞工及福利局局長：大家都看到，外展票站其實都是按照選管會的要求，現場是密封的。院友到場後，都是自己進場、自己投票、自己決定的。這裡依照法定要求，選民的投票意欲都是選民自己決定，整個投票過程都是保密，這個可以大家放心，這個工夫做得很充足。第二，無論是社會福利署的社工還是社福界的社工，其實都是很專業的。大家固然都有各自的工作，有不同的個案跟進，但是宏福苑火災發生後，大家都願意多走一步，沒有放下自己手上的工作，反之都會做多一點，加班加點，盡可能在這個困難的時候幫助宏福苑的家庭及受影響的居民，這個大家是願意的。工作是會更忙碌，並需要再做多一些工夫，但是以整個香港來說，大家都會多走一步，希望讓受影響居民盡快可以安頓下來，並為他們提供幫助。

至於我們社工方面，首先他們自己本身都有專業的訓練；第二，他們手頭上的個案工作必定會做足，盡力幫助手上的個案。要同一時間兼顧一個家庭的話，是有這個能力可以做到。此外，為了幫助我們的社工，我們已經配置了兩至三名公務員同事，主要是考慮到有些時候可能要東奔西走、為他們拿東西之類。若每次都要社工幫忙，那確實是不容易。若然有兩名公務員同事幫忙的話，可以減輕工作量，令整個服務流程做得更到位。

另外，大家都關心我們社工打電話的工作。社工每日會致電兩次，早午各一。現在，我們看到的接聽率都是85%，有時候會高一些，主要讓大家多點溝通，明白他們的需要。至於投票方面，其實只是在關心之餘，詢問他們是否需要幫忙或協助。舉例說，尤其是今天，基於他們搬遠了，我們會主動問候是否需要幫他們安排交通。如果他們希望去投票但有交通困難，社工便會幫助他們，打電話去處理其實質的支援需要。

今天是投票日，有些住戶都可能希望去投票，若他們需要特別的交通安排，社工便會幫他聯絡。在昨日的接觸當中，我掌握約20戶的居民表示希望我們幫他們安排交通，戶數不多，社工已經安排好，希望能方便他們。

選管會呼籲選民今日在立法會換屆選舉投票（附圖）,2025-12-07 13:45,2025-12-07 14:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700361.htm,"下稿代選舉管理委員會發出：

二○二五年立法會換屆選舉今日（十二月七日）舉行，選舉管理委員會（選管會）主席陸啟康法官呼籲選民踴躍投票。

陸啟康法官今日早上聯同選管會委員石丹理教授和文本立資深大律師巡視是次選舉的中央指揮中心及數據資訊中心，亦視察設於香港國際機場二號客運大樓的鄰近邊境投票站，以及分別位於不同地區的一般投票站。他表示，選管會觀察到各項投票安排運作暢順。

截至下午十二時三十分，全港共有536 527名地方選區選民已經投票，累積投票率為百分之12.99。

陸啟康法官說：「上月底大埔發生一場火災，選管會與全港市民一樣，目睹受災居民痛失至親和家園，心情一直十分沉重。但我們認為在這個困難的時刻，各位選民更應該在是次選舉中投票，以嚴肅的態度履行公民責任，選出新一屆立法會議員讓他們發揮其重要職能，才符合香港的整體利益。」

「我在此呼籲全港選民利用手上神聖的一票，選出新一屆立法會，共建更美好的共同家園。」

在今日的投票日，一般投票站、選舉委員會（選委會）界別投票站、設於警署的三個專用投票站，以及鄰近邊境投票站的投票時間由上午七時三十分至晚上十一時三十分。基於保安理由，設於懲教院所內的專用投票站，投票時間為上午九時至下午四時。至於先導安排下的專屬投票站（即公務員專屬投票站、醫院管理局醫護人員專屬投票站和少數族裔人士專屬投票站）和院舍外展投票站，投票時間分別為上午八時三十分至晚上九時三十分，及上午八時三十分至下午六時三十分。

選民可於選舉網站（www.elections.gov.hk）參考一般投票站、選委會界別投票站和鄰近邊境投票站的大概輪候時間，選民可因應輪候情況和個人日程而安排投票時間。

投票是自主及保密的。選民須於投票間內親自填劃選票。如選民需要協助，可以聯絡投票站職員。投票站內不可以干擾別人投票，或者使用電子器材通訊、拍照、錄音或錄影。投票站內亦不可以進行拉票活動、派發選舉廣告或者展示宣傳品。

投票結束後，大部分一般投票站會立即轉換為點票站，用以點算地方選區選票。獲編配少於500名選民投票的小投票站、專用投票站、選委會界別投票站、鄰近邊境投票站、專屬投票站和院舍外展投票站，其地方選區選票則會被送到九龍公園體育館的選票分流站兼綜合大點票站點算。所有功能界別及選委會界別的票箱則會被運送到位於會展的中央點票站，以進行點票。

當地方選區完成點票後，每個點票站的投票站主任會將點票結果通知在場的候選人或他們的代理人。核實同一個地方選區所有點票站的點票結果後，選舉事務處會將整體點票結果通知會展中央點票站內的選舉主任，並由選舉主任在新聞中心簽署和宣布選舉結果。至於功能界別和選委會界別，在點票結束並經數據資訊中心核實點票結果後，選舉主任會通知在場的候選人和他們的代理人點票結果，並在中央點票站的點票區內簽署和宣布選舉結果。選舉主任其後會在新聞中心的禮台上再次讀出所有選舉結果。

陸啟康法官與選管會兩位委員今日下午會繼續巡視不同的投票站，視察選舉事務。

選舉事務處熱線（2891 1001）將運作至午夜十二時，回答有關是次選舉的查詢。投訴熱線（2827 7251）亦將運作至午夜十二時，處理有關違反選舉規例或選舉活動指引的投訴。

每小時投票人數及選舉結果會上載到選舉網站。"
Electors urged to vote in Legislative Council General Election today (with photos),2025-12-07 13:45,2025-12-07 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700366.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Electoral Affairs Commission:

  The Chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC), Mr Justice David Lok, called on electors to vote in the 2025 Legislative Council General Election (LCGE) today (December 7).

 Mr Justice David Lok, along with EAC members Professor Daniel Shek and Mr Bernard Man, SC, visited the Central Command Centre and the Statistical Information Centre of the LCGE. They also inspected the Near Boundary Polling Station (NBPS) at Hong Kong International Airport Terminal 2, and the Ordinary Polling Stations located in different districts respectively this morning. Mr Justice Lok said the EAC observed that the operation of the polling stations is smooth.

As at 12.30pm, 536 527 electors for geographical constituencies (GCs) have voted, bringing the accumulative turnout rate to 12.99 per cent.

 Mr Justice Lok said, ""A fire broke out in Tai Po at the end of last month. Like all Hong Kong citizens, the EAC witnessed the affected residents losing their loved ones and homes, and we are deeply saddened. Yet we believe that in this difficult time, it is even more important that electors should cast their votes in the LCGE to fulfill their civic responsibility in a serious manner and elect a new term of Legislative Council Members for them to carry out their crucial functions and meet the overall interests of Hong Kong.

 ""I appeal to all electors across Hong Kong to make use of their sacred votes to elect the new Legislative Council and build a better Hong Kong that we call home together.""

 The polling hours for the Ordinary Polling Stations, the polling station of the Election Committee constituency (ECC), the three Dedicated Polling Stations set up at police stations and the NBPSs will be from 7.30am to 11.30pm. For the Dedicated Polling Stations set up at penal institutions, for security reasons, the polling hours will be from 9am to 4pm. For the Designated Polling Stations (namely the Civil Servant Designated Polling Stations, Hospital Authority Healthcare Staff Designated Polling Stations and Ethnic Minorities Designated Polling Stations) and Outreach Polling Stations for Residential Care Homes under the pilot arrangements, their polling hours are from 8.30am to 9.30pm, and from 8.30am to 6.30pm respectively.

 Electors can check the approximate waiting time of Ordinary Polling Stations, the ECC polling station and NBPSs on the election website (www.elections.gov.hk). Depending on the waiting time and their schedule, electors can make their own arrangements on when to vote.

 The ballot is autonomous and secret. Electors must mark their ballot papers on their own in the voting compartment. If in need, electors may ask for assistance from the polling staff. Electors must not disturb others during voting, nor use electronic communication devices, take photographs or make audio or video recordings in the polling stations. Canvassing, distribution of election advertisements or displaying propaganda materials are also prohibited inside polling stations.

 After the close of poll, a majority of the Ordinary Polling Stations will be changed to counting stations immediately for the counting of votes of GCs. For small polling stations of which less than 500 electors are assigned to vote, Dedicated Polling Stations, the ECC polling station, NBPSs, Designated Polling Stations and Outreach Polling Stations for Residential Care Homes, the GC ballot papers will be delivered to the ballot paper sorting station cum consolidated main counting stations at Kowloon Park Sports Centre for counting. The ballot boxes of all functional constituencies (FCs) and the ECC will be delivered to the Central Counting Station at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) for counting.

 For the GCs, upon completion of the count, the Presiding Officer of each counting station will make known the counting results to the candidates or their agents present. Upon verification of the counting results of all counting stations in a GC, the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) will notify the Returning Officer (RO) at the Central Counting Station at HKCEC of the overall counting result for the RO to sign and declare the election results at the Media Centre. As for the FCs and ECC, once the counting of votes is completed and the election results are verified by the Statistical Information Centre, the ROs will notify the present candidates and their agents of the counting results, and sign and declare the election results at the counting zone of the Central Counting Station. The election results will be announced again by the ROs on stage of the Media Centre.

  Mr Justice Lok and the two EAC members will inspect different polling stations this afternoon to see for themselves the electoral affairs.

  The REO's hotline at 2891 1001 will be in service until midnight to answer enquiries relating to the LCGE. A complaints hotline at 2827 7251 will also operate until midnight to handle complaints about breaches of electoral rules and guidelines.

 Hourly voter turnouts and election results will be available on the election website."

政制及內地事務局局長：各位早晨，我剛剛完成了投票的過程。今早整體的投票安排十分暢順。今早七時半，我們包括所有人員、系統、以至場地均是有序、準時地開啓了投票安排。到八時半，其他的專屬票站，以至外展票站亦是如期準時開放，提供服務。

到目前為止，我們的投票率，經過兩小時到九時半，整體地區投票率為4.18%。相對於上一次立法會選舉同一時間的3.18%是提高了。整體安排上亦很暢順，平均只需數分鐘即可完成整個投票流程。

我在此再次呼籲大家，這次立法會選舉對香港非常重要，正如我們一再強調，對於行穩致遠、一國兩制，以至良政善治、由治及興都非常重要，甚至對大埔火災的善後工作，推動改革，完善制度這些，亦是非常重要，需要立法會議員與我們一起共同努力。所以我們希望大家今日踴躍投票，利用手上一票令香港更安全、更美好。

記者：局長你好。有傳媒今日報道，今屆立法會選舉近三成投票站的禁止拉票區的範圍縮小了，包括局長旁邊這個票站。那樣會否影響市民投票之前的冷靜期？

政制及內地事務局局長：我們設立拉票區最主要的目的，一方面是希望不要妨礙選民進出票站，同時要確保票站運作正常。此外，我們亦要兼顧候選人拉票活動的需要。每次我們安排上都會按照實際情況，以至整個票站的地形、各方面的環境去設定（禁止）拉票區的範圍。今次來說我們都覺得是合適的。"

​政務司司長立法會選舉投票後會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-12-07 12:55,2025-12-07 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700285.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（十二月七日）早上在保良局蕭漢森小學為二○二五年立法會換屆選舉投票後會見傳媒的談話內容：

政務司司長：各位早晨，我剛完成了投票。整個過程用了一、兩分鐘時間，很順利。剛才進入票站時，我一直有留意，我們的指示是非常清晰、清楚。投票時，職員的講解亦都十分清晰、清楚。首先，我很多謝我們的同事，這次的安排我認為是滿意的，整個過程很順利，我希望各位市民能盡早投票。

我也明白因火災原因，大家都有些傷痛、傷感。但大家都要明白，正如行政長官所說，將來的立法會對於香港的施政，特別是幫助災民方面，包括如何去救災、改革，我們都需要立法會的配合和監督。正因如此，立法會的選出對於香港未來，包括對於災民的幫助很重要，所以我很希望大家能夠盡早投票。

雖然今日的投票時間會到晚上十一時三十分，但根據我們以往的經驗，通常晚上的人會較多，所以如大家不想排隊，或想時間短一些，就可早點投票，人流就不會太多。

我希望再一次呼籲，大家為香港的未來，投下你神聖的一票。多謝各位。

記者：司長你好，會否擔心受火災影響，新界東北這區的投票率比其他選區低？居民情緒未回復，未安置好、未準備好，就要處理投票的事，是否擔心有認受性問題？關於大埔火災，當局可否保障會全面公開調查報告？可否解釋一下，為甚麼不成立獨立調查委員會？

政務司司長：好，多謝你的提問。首先我們明白到，不單只大埔區，全港市民就這次事件的心情都很沉重，但正如我剛才所說，第一，投票所需的時間很短，一、兩分鐘就可以做完；第二，投票的意義是重要的，除了因為讓香港繼續前行外，要幫助災民，很多事情都要立法會配合和監督，包括撥款和他們給予我們的意見，這些全部都是和立法會合作去做，所以我們很希望能夠依時選出新一屆立法會，令立法會不會在一月一日——若選不出來的話就有真空，就會阻礙香港政府的施政，這點是重要的。

至於那些棚網，很大部分已經下架，我們會盡快推出安全守則，令棚網再上架時是安全的，我們會這樣做。

至於獨立委員會方面，行政長官說過，會由一位法官主持，（成員）也有專業人士、業界人士——全部不是政府人員，是獨立人士、專業人士，確保整個調查專業外，亦能有效進行。我們很希望能盡快找出這件事件的成因，原因是甚麼，漏洞是甚麼，哪些地方需要我們去修改、改革，加強監管，這都是委員會的工作。我們希望能夠盡快做好後，盡快落實，目的是希望悲劇不會再發生，保障市民未來的安全。

記者：司長你對於早上的投票人數滿不滿意？

政務司司長：現在還是很早，但是正如我剛才所講，我們的工作目標是希望所有合資格的選民都出來投票，這是我們的工作目標。當然我們沒有預設投票率是多少。希望所有合資格的選民都出來投票，一起共建一個更美好的香港。謝謝。

記者：司長，「一戶一社工」幫居民投票是否強制性的措施？居民會否有選擇？昨日是棚網拆除令的最後一日，還有幾多屋苑未全面拆除棚網？會否容許屋苑延遲拆棚網？最後一個問題，就是有些居民關注，當裝回新棚網時，會否還有一個安全性？現時棚架沒有棚網的承托和保護，反而可能有很多雜物會令到棚架更危險，你怎樣去保障受影響居民的安全？

政務司司長：「一戶一社工」成立目的是幫助受災的市民，並不是為投票而設，這個大家要清楚。所以他們並不會要求市民去投票，這並不是他們的工作範圍。但當然，如果有些受災的市民想前往投票，但現在他並不方便，社工是否可以幫助他？這個是可以幫助到他的。我們是應他的要求去幫他，並不是逼他去投票。我想大家要弄清楚這一點，這是很重要的。

至於棚網的問題，剛才我已經說過，因為第一，在初期調查，警方和廉政公署都發現有人造假，情況都比較嚴重，所以我們為了安全計，一定要全部先下網，這是重要的。但我們給予三日時間下網，是希望承辦商盡快去做，當然，大部分已經完成，有些趕不及的如何處理？趕不及的，他們需要向我們解釋是甚麼原因而未能趕及，如果有特別原因做不到，我們會容許的，會適當地延長期限。

大家要明白，我們這次的工作目的，並不是想懲罰承辦商，要求他們下網、圍網下架，並不是想懲罰他們，是想安全。所以，如果他們遲了一日半日、遲兩日，有原因的話，我們會容許，這個我們亦多次強調。

至於未來，我們一定會有一個更新的守則，要確保那些圍網是安全，才可以再上架，特別是大家看到我們調查出來的，有一些不良商人將合規格與不合規格的圍網混合使用。在一些只有消防員能去到、其他人無法去到的地方，他們會用一些不合規格的圍網。一般人能夠去到的地方，就使用合規格的。針對這方面，我們會發出一些新守則，盡快堵塞這個漏洞。這是重要的，我們希望將來所有圍網再上網使用時是安全的，這就是我們的工作目標。多謝各位。"
行政長官立法會選舉投票後會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-12-07 12:53,2025-12-07 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700340.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十二月七日）早上在高主教書院投票站為二○二五年立法會換屆選舉投票後會見傳媒的談話內容：

行政長官：大家早晨。剛剛我和太太投完票，整個過程很順暢，票站人員很投入、態度很好、解釋得很清楚，我們很快就投完票，整個過程是方便的。為了方便大家投票，今次政府推行了多項措施，包括延長投票時間，上午提早了一小時，七時半開始一般票站便可以投票，晚上亦延長了一小時，至十一時半才結束，共增加兩小時，讓大家有足夠時間投票，總共有十六小時。

我們亦做了各種方便市民投票的措施，例如今次設立的票站總共有660多個。除了一般票站有610多個外，我們亦設立了很多專用票站，例如設有10個票站方便紀律部隊和公務員投票、七個專屬票站讓醫院管理局的醫護人員投票、有兩個專門讓少數族裔投票。為了照顧長者和殘疾人士，針對安老院和殘疾人士院舍，我們設立了三個專屬票站，覆蓋範圍針對11個安老院和四個殘疾院舍，地點很接近他們的院舍，方便他們投票。為了進一步照顧長者和殘疾人士，我們在地區的長者中心以及殘疾人士支援中心，給予每個中心20,000元資助，讓他們作出各種便利安排，例如交通等，希望方便大家。另外，為了方便出入境的選民，我們在三個地方設立了票站，包括上水、港珠澳大橋和機場的出入境管制站。我們的目的是希望大家踴躍投票。

大埔宏福苑火災令大家都很悲痛，正因如此，我們有很多工作要做，包括支援災民、善後和重建。我們一定要查個水落石出，追究責任，推動制度改革，令我們的社會更安全，市民生活得更安心。我亦說過，立法會召開第一次會議時，政府就會提出第一個議案，討論我們如何支援災民和善後重建，推動制度改革。我們希望與立法會議員一起商議，通過大家的討論，盡量照顧好災民，盡快找出真相，盡快復原和重建。

立法會有很多權力，我們一定要跟立法會合作，例如審批撥款、制訂新法例等。大家一起將現有制度的漏洞填補、阻塞，鞏固整體城市安全，讓市民生活得更安心。所以，這次一定要所有選民今天出來投票，因為這一票是代表我們推動改革的一票、代表我們守護災民的一票，亦代表我們凝聚力量、共同前行的一票。多謝大家。

記者：你好，有兩條問題，首先想問早前政務司司長說過，政府沒有為投票率設下一個目標，是否代表政府其實不着緊投票率？如果不着緊的話，其實政府最重視的是甚麼？第二個問題想問宏福苑火災，政府設立一個獨立委員會，其實主要想盡快有個調查結果出來，特首你會否承諾在你的任期結束之前會公布這個結果？如果會的話，會否授權獨立委員會有一個調查權去介入？謝謝。

行政長官：今日投票是重要的。剛才我講述過今日投票的意義，所以希望所有選民都參與，這是我們的目標。我們在選舉前，以及今日，大力推動選民出來投票，因為今日這一票是重要的，是我們大家推動改革、大家守護災民，以及大家凝聚力量、共同前進的一票。

選好立法會令我們可以做更多事，無論是處理今次災情、善後工作，以及我們將來的制度改革，或者社會整體的發展，都是非常重要。所以希望每位都出來參與，我們的目標是大家都出來參與、推動大家出來參與，越多人參與越好。越多人參與正正就是各位對於香港社會的期望，因為履行好自己的公民責任和義務，是我們共建香港非常重要的一部分。所以，希望每一位都出來投票、參與。

另外，我非常重視要查出真相、追究責任，所以我提出成立獨立委員會，由法官做主持。我現在正在物色法官，已經與終審法院首席法官商討這件事。當物色到法官後，我會與這位法官商討怎樣可以查出真相、高效，以及怎樣可以進動整個制度改革。因為在委員會中揭示出的不同問題，將會是我們重點改革和追究責任的重要部分。我一向都是心急人，所以會盡快與我們物色到的法官商討這方面的事情。這方面的事情當我們有了決定，很快就會向大家公布。

我重複我的目標：一定要查個水落石出、追究責任，追究到底，要負責任的人就要負責，我希望高效處理所有事情。所以在程序中，我們做到公平公正，我們在找到事實真相和各個環節需要改善的地方後，不會等所有結果出來，便會逐步跟進，希望所有事情在最快時間令到我們整個社會更安全，市民生活得更安心。

記者：特首，想問投票開始後，各個票站的運作情況是否暢順？你覺得今日的投票氣氛怎樣？在大埔災區的票站安排，你覺得會如何協助受影響的居民？

行政長官：我聽取了不同票站的綜合報告，是暢順的。在大埔區，已經有選民開始投票。我們針對大埔區有特別安排，亦有特別安排的交通路線，方便選民去投票。只要選民提出他們需要的協助，我們都會盡量幫助，特別是針對有需要人士，我們有社工、已動員的公務員、關愛隊等。所以大埔區的居民也好，大埔區以外的居民也好，任何可以方便的措施，我們都會做，亦鼓勵不同機構去做。

整體運作是暢順的，現在時間尚早，我相信選民會陸陸續續出來投票。我再次呼籲大家，一起出來投票，因為今日你投的一票，意義非常重大，是我們一起推動改革的一票，是我們守護災民的一票，是凝聚力量、共同前進的一票。

記者：特首早晨。今日是投票日，除了有商家向選民提供優惠，亦都有一些商家向大埔居民提供優惠和捐款。你對坊間這種安排有甚麼看法？你怎樣看今次投票對香港、對選民的意義？有沒有甚麼說話想對選民說？

行政長官：任何支持選舉和支援災民的安排，我都是非常鼓舞和非常支持的。事實上，我們在一個多月前已經開始向大家講解今次選舉的重要性。所以，坊間無論是個別人士，或者一些機構去支持選舉，令選民可以履行他們的公民責任，令我們選好立法會，有一些懷有抱負的立法會議員與我們一起去共同建設更好的香港，意義是很重大的。而且，立法會在我們的憲制秩序中，有權力和政府一起做好事情、幹好事情。很多事情都需要立法會與政府一起去做，所以是意義重大。我們建設更美好香港、守護災民，都要經過立法會的力量。所以，任何支持選民出來投票，鼓勵他們或者支援災民，我都是支持的。

另外，今日投票的意義重大，我再重複一次：我們會積極與立法會議員配合和商討，不同支援災民和制度改革、復原重建，在這些方面是需要緊密合作。所以，我們建設更美好香港，今日必須要出來投票，利用好你手上一票，選出你認為最適合的議員去代表你，為香港——無論是災情、無論是復原重建，或者在其他方面，建立香港的經濟發展以及改善民生方面的舉措。今次大家出來投票，選出你認為最適合的議員，可以大家一起努力共建香港。多謝大家。"
