SCST visits Shanghai (with photos),2025-06-18 21:22,2025-06-18 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800240.htm," The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, visited Shanghai today (June 18). In the morning, she went to the Shanghai Museum on People's Square and was given a guided tour of a well-received exhibition, ""On Top of the Pyramid: The Civilization of Ancient Egypt"". During her visit, Miss Law met with Deputy Director of the Shanghai Museum Mr Huang He. She thanked the Shanghai Museum for its support of Hong Kong over the years, while Mr Huang shared experiences in developing and designing creative products. Miss Law said Hong Kong could learn a lot from the Shanghai Museum in developing cultural and creative industries. Miss Law expressed hope that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSARG) and the Shanghai Museum will strengthen their cultural co-operation in the future, contributing cultural content to the country's modernisation and promoting cultural prosperity.

 After that, Miss Law called on the Director of the Shanghai Administration of Sports, Mr Xu Bin, and had a working lunch together, during which she shared with him Hong Kong's progress and achievements in promoting sports development. Mr Xu said there is huge room for developing culture, sports and tourism, while sports exchanges serve as a bridge between the two places and can also boost economic and social developments. Miss Law said that Hong Kong, China athletes achieved excellent results in international competitions in recent years, which helps lift citizens' interests in sports and support for athletes. Miss Law added that Hong Kong is preparing at full steam for the 15th National Games and the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games to be cohosted with Guangdong and Macao this November and December. Through today's exchange, Miss Law said she hopes to learn from Shanghai's experiences in hosting same events and further improve the preparatory work.

 In the afternoon, Miss Law visited the Memorial Hall of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China and met with the Secretary of the Party Committee and Director of the Memorial, Mr Xue Feng. The Memorial is the site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held in 1921, in which the founding of the CPC was announced, bearing great significance. Noting that the HKSARG is setting up a museum to introduce the country's developments and achievements and preparing exhibitions related to the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Miss Law said the visit was arranged intentionally to seek guidance, with an aim to make better preparations for the relevant projects in the future.

 In the evening, Miss Law attended the opening ceremony and dinner of WestK Shanghai Week 2025. Speaking at the event, she said that Hong Kong and Shanghai are connected by blood and share common traits, as they are both exemplars of the fusion of Eastern and Western cultures and dazzling Pearls of the Orient. The two places actively deepen international exchanges and co-operations in areas of economy, culture and globalisation, serving as pioneers in the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

 Miss Law also said, ""The West Kowloon Cultural District (WKCD) is an important cultural infrastructure investment of the HKSARG. After many years of development, the WKCD has transformed from a blueprint into reality today and become one of the largest cultural hubs in the world, featuring performing arts venues with our country's staunch support. The Hong Kong Palace Museum, which opened in 2022, and the M+ museum, which commenced operation in 2021, have become world-class museums blending traditional and contemporary arts and cultures.""

 ""The West Kowloon Cultural District Authority (WKCDA) kick-started WestK Shanghai Week today. It is the first time a series of exhibitions and performing arts programmes and cultural exchange activities have been brought outside Hong Kong. It is not only an important milestone of the HKSARG driving top-notch arts, cultural and creative programmes to go global, but also showcases Hong Kong's diverse arts achievements and further attracts local and overseas visitors to experience Hong Kong's vibrancy and appeal firsthand,"" Miss Law added.

 Supporting organisations of WestK Shanghai Week 2025 include the Shanghai Municipal Administration of Culture and Tourism, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau of the HKSARG, and the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Shanghai of the HKSARG.

 This morning, Miss Law visited the ""WestK x MANNER"" limited-edition art collaboration themed store, jointly rolled out by the WKCDA and Shanghai's beloved coffee brand MANNER COFFEE. The store invited Hong Kong's renowned illustrator Don Mak to craft exclusive designs inspired by the Victoria Harbour skyline, WKCD panoramas and iconic Hong Kong urban motifs, demonstrating the creative charm of integrating culture, creative industry and tourism.

 Upon arrival yesterday (June 17), Miss Law had a working lunch with representatives of the management of Shanghai Shendi Group to exchange information on the latest tourism situation in Shanghai and Hong Kong. She also visited the Shanghai Disney Resort to learn about its operation and development. Miss Law said that the Shanghai Disney Resort and the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort are iconic attractions in the two places, which play vital roles in driving regional tourism and economic development.

 Miss Law will depart from Shanghai for Hong Kong tonight."

其後，羅淑佩拜訪上海市體育局局長徐彬，並進行工作午餐，分享香港推動體育發展的工作進展和成果。徐彬局長表示，文化、體育及旅遊發展空間很大，而體育切磋是兩地交流的橋樑，也可以促進經濟的拉動和社會的發展。羅淑佩說，近年中國香港運動員在國際賽事上的成績斐然，提升了市民對體育的關心和運動員的支持；而香港特區政府正密鑼緊鼓籌備今年十一月及十二月與廣東及澳門三地共同承辦的第十五屆全國運動會和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會，希望透過今次交流，汲取上海曾經舉辦相同活動的經驗，進一步完善籌備工作。

下午，羅淑佩參觀中國共產黨第一次全國代表大會紀念館（中共一大紀念館），並與中共一大紀念館黨委書記、館長薛峰會面。中共一大紀念館是中國共產黨第一次全國代表大會會址，在一九二一年宣告了中國共產黨的誕生，意義非凡且重大。羅淑佩表示，香港特區政府也正在籌備一個介紹國家發展和成就的博物館，以及有關抗戰勝利八十周年的展覽，此行特意取經，為未來相關項目作更好的準備。

羅淑佩傍晚出席「2025上海西九文化周」開幕典禮及晚宴。她致辭時表示，香港和上海可謂血脈相連、氣質相通，皆是中西文化交融的典範、耀眼的東方明珠。兩地在經濟、文化與全球化的進程中，積極深化國際交往合作，共同為中華民族的偉大復興做好排頭兵的角色。

羅淑佩續說：「西九文化區是香港特別行政區政府重要文化基建投資。經過多年發展，今天的西九文化區已經從藍圖變成現實，成為全球最具規模的文化樞紐之一，擁有表演藝術場地，得到國家的大力支持。在二○二二年開館的香港故宮文化博物館，和二○二一年開始投入運作的M+，都是世界級博物館，糅合傳統與當代文化藝術。」

羅淑佩又指出：「西九文化區管理局今天啓動『上海西九文化周』，是第一次把一系列展覽、表演藝術節目、文化交流活動帶到香港以外。這不但是落實特區政府推動香港頂尖文化藝術創意項目『走出去』的重要里程碑，向外展示香港的多元藝術成就，更能夠吸引海內外朋友到訪香港，親身體驗我們的活力和魅力。」

「2025上海西九文化周」的特別支持機構包括上海市文化和旅遊局、上海市人民政府港澳事務辦公室、香港特區政府文化體育及旅遊局，以及香港特區政府駐上海經濟貿易辦事處。

同日上午，羅淑佩參觀由西九文化區管理局與上海知名咖啡品牌MANNER COFFEE合作推出「WestK x MANNER」限定藝術聯乘主題門店。該門店特邀香港著名插畫師麥東記創作以維港天際線、西九文化區全景及香港標誌性城市符號為題的文創產品，展現文創與旅遊結合的創意魅力。

羅淑佩昨日（六月十七日）抵達上海，隨即與上海申迪集團管理層代表進行工作午餐，交流滬港旅遊業最新情況，並考察上海迪士尼度假區，了解其營運及發展情況。羅淑佩表示，上海迪士尼度假區和香港迪士尼樂園度假區作為兩地的標誌性旅遊景點，在推動區域旅遊及經濟發展方面發揮重要作用。

羅淑佩今日晚上離開上海啓程返港。"
Government's response to temporary stay granted by Court about decision to remove Aggressive Construction Company Limited from register,2025-06-18 20:45,2025-06-18 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800801.htm,"In response to the grant by the Court of First Instance of the High Court today (June 18) of an interim-interim stay of execution of the Building Authority's (BA) decision to remove the Aggressive Construction Company Limited (ACCL) from the register of general building contractors, the Development Bureau (DEVB) said that to consider further steps, the Buildings Department (BD), in its capacity as the BA, would study the written judgment to be handed down by the Court shortly together with its legal team. Meanwhile, the BD will prepare for the appeal hearing with full effort.

The BA refused the registration renewal application of ACCL on May 22, 2025 and decided to remove its name from the register of general building contractors on June 20. ACCL has appealed against the decision and applied for a stay of execution of the decision. The Court of First Instance of the High Court today granted an interim-interim stay of execution of the decision. The hearing of the appeal and application for stay of execution is tentatively scheduled for August 26 and 27.

The spokesman for the DEVB said, ""As the Court has granted an interim-interim stay of execution of the decision, ACCL will not be removed from the register of general building contractors on June 20. During the period pending further hearings, if there are still construction activities on the project sites undertaken by ACCL, the project owners concerned will act in accordance with the contracts and continue to monitor the construction sites and the performance of the contractor. If the contractor's performance fails to meet the contractual requirements, the project owners will handle the matter in accordance with the contract and reserve the right to take follow-up actions. The BD and project owners will also step up monitoring and surprise inspections to safeguard site safety. In fact, since the performance of ACCL in respect of the public works project of the Chai Wan Government Complex was far below the contractual requirements, the Government as the project owner has terminated the contract in accordance with the contractual mechanism and taken over the construction site on June 15. The Government will endeavour to arrange in the near term for a new contractor to take over and finish the remaining works."""

尊敬的解冬副市長（上海市副市長）、唐英年主席（西九文化區管理局董事局主席）、鍾曉敏局長（上海市文化和旅遊局局長）、各位來賓、各位朋友：

大家晚上好。我很榮幸今日來到上海，和各位一起為「2025上海西九文化周」主持開幕。

兩年前，我以運輸署署長的身分到訪上海，參觀上海的新能源汽車發展和智慧交通管理，獲益良多；這次再到上海，崗位已經改變，考察的內容完全不同，這一次讓我能聚焦學習我非常感興趣的文化藝術領域，格外的興奮。

香港跟上海可謂血脈相連、氣質相通，都是東西文化交融的典範。兩座城市都是國家重要的國際樞紐，都是耀眼的東方明珠，在中外人文交流中扮演橋樑的角色。儘管當前世界地緣政治複雜多變，我們兩個城市依然在經濟、文化與全球化的進程中，積極深化國際交流合作，一同為中華民族的偉大復興做好「排頭兵」的角色。

國家《十四五規劃綱要》明確支持香港發展成為中外文化藝術交流中心。為實現國家賦予香港的重要定位，香港特區政府去年公布了《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，為實現香港未來的文化藝術和創意產業發展訂下清晰的願景和發展的方向，當中西九文化區管理局是我們的其中最重要的策略夥伴，發揮不可或缺的作用。

西九文化區是香港特別行政區政府最重要的文化基建投資。經過多年的發展，今日的西九文化區已經從藍圖變為現實，成為全球最具規模的文化樞紐之一，擁有表演藝術場地、得到國家大力支持，在二○二二年開館的香港故宮文化博物館，和二○二一年開始投入運作的M+，都是世界級博物館，糅合傳統與當代文化藝術。每年，西九文化區傾力呈獻最優秀的文化藝術節目，不但廣受香港市民的歡迎，更已經成為訪港遊客必訪的文化旅遊目的地，推動文旅融合。

為響應香港特區行政長官李家超在去年《施政報告》提出的政策，西九文化區管理局領頭建設香港文藝創意產業鏈，加強文化藝術創意項目產出，管理局今天啓動的「2025上海西九文化周」，是第一次把一系列展覽、表演藝術節目、文化交流活動帶到香港以外。這不但是落實特區政府推動香港頂尖文化藝術創意項目「走出去」的重要里程碑，向外展示香港的多元藝術成就，更能夠吸引海內外朋友到訪香港，親身體驗我們的活力和魅力。

事實上，香港跟上海的文化合作真是多不勝數。過去兩年，香港主要和中小型藝團在上海演出了接近30場音樂、話劇、舞蹈表演。文化交流有來有往，我們現在正熱切期待上海的朋友在今年八月的中華文化節把傳統江南絲竹音樂帶給香港的觀眾。再加上今日這個前所未有的滬港文化盛宴，我相信我們將進一步激發兩地的文化連結，促進藝文界的創新對話與合作，共同努力建立五光十色、百花齊放、多彩多姿的文化氛圍。

剛才我提到西九文化區在文旅融合的角色。特區政府在其他範疇也會繼續秉承國家「以文塑旅、以旅彰文」的方向，發展和豐富自身的香港文化內涵，豐富旅客的旅遊體驗，落實貫徹中央國務院港澳事務辦公室夏寶龍主任指導的「香港無處不旅遊」理念。我知道上海同胞特別熱愛旅遊，我歡迎你們多來香港走走逛逛、吃吃香港點心，還有剛才提到的菠蘿包、乾炒牛河，看看大熊貓。我們香港上下發揮熱情好客的精神，一定會讓大家樂而忘返，念念不忘，一來再來。

最後，我代表特區政府，向上海市人民政府對「2025上海西九文化周」的大力支持致以最衷心的感謝。我也感謝西九文化區管理局主辦和所有台前幕後工作人員，為這一次盛會的成功舉辦付出的心力、努力。

我祝願「2025上海西九文化周」圓滿成功，讓滬港兩地文化交流譜寫新篇章。謝謝各位。"
CHP investigates confirmed Mpox case,2025-06-18 19:57,2025-06-18 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800768.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) said today (June 18) that it is investigating a confirmed Mpox (also known as Monkeypox) case, and urged the public to be vigilant and avoid close physical contact with persons suspected of contracting Mpox. Meanwhile, high-risk target groups are advised to receive Mpox vaccinations.

The case involves a 20-year-old male. He developed skin ulcer and swollen lymph nodes on June 10 and attended the Yau Ma Tei Male Social Hygiene Clinic of the DH on June 16. He is in stable condition and is being isolated at Princess Margaret Hospital.

  An initial investigation revealed that he had not received Mpox vaccination. He had a history of high-risk exposure in Hong Kong during the incubation period, but no epidemiological linkages have been established between this case and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong. The CHP is continuing its epidemiological investigations of the case and will report it to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The WHO held a special meeting on Mpox early this month and confirmed that Mpox remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The WHO continued to appeal to member statesto enhance surveillance and prevention and control measures forMpox, in order to reduce the spread of Mpox.Hong Kong has put in place the Preparedness and Response Plan for Mpox (the Plan) since June 2022 and activated the alert response level under the Plan after the first confirmed case of Mpox in September of the same year. The CHP has implemented a series of measures (including enhanced surveillance, contact tracing, public education and vaccination) which have been effective in preventing local outbreaks of Mpox in the past three years.

Since 2022, a total of 76 Mpox cases (62 local and 14 imported) have been recorded in Hong Kong, of which eight cases were recorded this year. All patients were male. Epidemiological investigations revealed that most cases had history of high-risk sexual behaviours, including having sex with strangers or without wearing condoms when having sex. Hong Kong has not yet detected any new Mpox strain (Clade Ib) cases.

The CHP reminded high-risk target groups to receive Mpox vaccinations in order to lower the risk of infection or the possibility of having more severe symptoms after infection. In addition, persons who experience Mpox symptoms (including rashes, fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, exhaustion, muscle pain, and severe headaches) or suspect themselves of being infected are advised to seek medical attention and receive treatment at once. They should not engage in activities with others that may expose others to their skin rash or body fluids. Members of the public should maintain good personal and hand hygiene to prevent virus transmission or infection through contact. They should also avoid close physical contact with persons or animals suspected of being infected.

The CHP has set up an Mpox telephone hotline (2125 2373), which operates from Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm, excluding public holidays. Those who suspect or are concerned that they may have had high-risk contact with confirmed cases, particularly men who have sex with men or those who have sexual practices with strangers, can use the hotline to make enquiries and receive relevant health advice.

Furthermore, the DH provides vaccination services to high-risk groups of Mpox. The following high-risk target groups are eligible for Mpox vaccinations on a voluntary basis:


individuals with high-risk sexual practices, e.g. having multiple sexual partners, sex workers, or having a history of sexually transmitted infection within the past 12 months;
healthcare workersresponsible forcaring forpatients with confirmed Mpox;

政府回應法庭暫緩將精進建築除名的決定,2025-06-18 19:43,2025-06-18 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800754.htm,"就高等法院原訟法庭今日（六月十八日）暫時批准精進建築有限公司（「精進建築」）申請暫緩執行建築事務監督將其從「一般建築承建商名冊」除名的決定，發展局表示屋宇署作為建築事務監督會與法律團隊研究法庭稍後頒下的書面判決，以考慮進一步行動。與此同時，署方會全力準備上訴聆訊。

建築事務監督於二○二五年五月二十二日拒絕「精進建築」的註冊續期申請，並決定於六月二十日將其從「一般建築承建商名冊」中除名。「精進建築」日前就上述決定提出上訴並申請暫緩執行決定。高等法院原訟法庭今日暫時批准暫緩執行決定的申請。上訴及暫緩執行決定申請聆訊暫定於八月二十六及二十七日進行。

發展局發言人表示：「由於法庭暫時批准暫緩執行除名的決定，因此『精進建築』不會在六月二十日從『一般建築承建商名冊』除名。在等候進一步聆訊期間，如『精進建築』承辦的發展項目地盤仍有建築活動，相關項目擁有人會根據合約行事，繼續監督建築地盤和承建商的表現。如承建商的表現不符合合約要求，項目擁有人會按合約處理，並保留跟進權利。屋宇署和項目擁有人亦會加強監察和突擊巡查，保障地盤工地安全。事實上，由於『精進建築』在柴灣政府大樓工務工程的表現遠低於合約要求，政府作為項目擁有人已按合約機制終止合約，於六月十五日收回該建築地盤，並爭取短期內安排新承建商接手完成餘下工程。」"
立法會：創新科技及工業局副局長就「以新質生產力激發香港中小型企業蓬勃發展，積極對接國家高質量『出海』戰略」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-06-18 19:39,2025-06-18 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800752.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局副局長張曼莉今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上，就「以新質生產力激發香港中小型企業蓬勃發展，積極對接國家高質量『出海』戰略」議員議案的總結發言：

代主席：

感謝提出議案的陳祖恒議員，亦感謝提出修正案的嚴剛議員及29位議員提供寶貴的意見。就議員提到幾個與創新科技（創科）相關方面，包括發展新質生產力、推動企業採用科技升級轉型，善用香港檢測認證等專業服務及生產性服務業的能力，助力我們的企業「出海」，以及吸引更多優秀科技企業落戶香港及幫助他們利用香港獨特的優勢拓展海外市場，我希望在此作重點回應。

我們認同不少議員提及加快發展新質生產力，推動企業（包括中小企業）結合科技升級轉型的重要性。為此，特區政府撥款五億元予數碼港，在去年推出「數碼轉型支援先導計劃」，協助涵蓋餐飲、零售、旅遊及個人服務業的中小企更好應用數碼科技。計劃目前已批出逾5 400宗申請。有獲資助的零售店表示，計劃能幫助他們提升營運效率、擴展顧客群，生意額也有所增長。此外，正如吳永嘉議員有提到，在推動新質生產力的路上，工業亦都要加速轉型。我們去年優化了「新型工業化資助計劃」，積極鼓勵本港傳統製造業利用創科升級轉型，轉向智能製造。政府亦將在今年內推出「製造及生產線『升』級支援先導計劃」，以配對形式向每家在港營運生產線的企業提供最多25萬元的資助，協助他們為現有生產線引進先進技術。而這些不論是數碼轉型、技術及生產力的提升，其實也是企業蓬勃發展及「走出去」的基礎和本錢。

另一方面，正如李慧琼議員及陳紹雄議員等也有提到，香港的檢測和認證業信譽昭著，亦都是我們助力企業「出海」的一張皇牌。憑着業界專業、高效靈活的服務和「香港檢測‧香港認證」的品牌，可有效協助企業提升其產品的品質和安全；加上香港擁有完善的知識產權保護制度及成熟的國際網絡，結合起來能讓企業更好地對外展示其產品的質量，從而協助企業「走出去」。政府會繼續支持香港檢測和認證局，進一步提高香港檢測和認證服務的專業水平，致力提升業界發出檢測認證結果的國際認受性，從而更好地配合國家高質量「出海」的發展策略。

另一方面，有不少議員也提及，香港要積極引進海內外優秀的創科企業落戶，以及希望協助這些落戶企業連同本地的企業利用香港獨特的優勢「併船出海」。我在這裏向各位議員匯報，截至今年四月，我們已經與超過200家來自海內外有潛力或具代表性之創科企業洽談好於香港落戶或擴展業務，當中更有不少引進的創科企業除了已拓展業務外，亦已申請或已成功在香港交易所上市。此外，我們的創科公營機構，包括大家熟悉的香港科技園公司（科技園公司）、數碼港及香港生產力促進局（生產力局）亦會繼續大力支持創科企業開拓不同市場。例如：科技園公司及數碼港現正積極拓展海外市場的合作夥伴網絡，為其園區創科企業、我們本地不同的創科中小企、初創可以提供更好的支援，以協助他們有更好的網絡，更高效地進軍國際市場，並橋接海內外資金。

另外，亦有很多議員提到「出海」的服務。在這方面，我們的生產力局亦率先佈局，成立「出海服務中心」The Cradle，既推廣本港的先進技術的方案及產品，亦為企業「出海」提供一站式涵蓋產品開發、ESG及檢測服務、海外市場推廣、國際化技術標準對接、知識產權管理、乃至海外法規等一站式技術支援、對接及專業服務，助力企業「併船出海」。當然，很多議員提到除了「出海」，我們亦積極透過不同佈局，支援我們的企業同時間拓展大灣區以至內地龐大市場的發展機遇。

代主席、各位議員，我們會繼續與各持份者緊密合作，聆聽議會及業界意見，積極支持以新質生產力激發香港的創科及中小企業蓬勃發展，充分利用香港的優勢，對接國家高質量「出海」戰略，為香港、為國家貢獻高質量發展。本人謹此陳辭。"
衞生防護中心調查一宗猴痘確診個案,2025-06-18 19:20,2025-06-18 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800748.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（六月十八日）表示，正調查一宗猴痘確診個案，並提醒市民提高警覺，避免與懷疑感染猴痘的人士作密切身體接觸，同時強烈建議高風險目標群組人士接種猴痘疫苗。

個案涉及一名20歲男子。他於六月十日開始出現皮膚潰瘍和淋巴結腫大，六月十六日到衞生署油麻地男性社會衞生科診所求診。病人情況穩定，現於瑪嘉烈醫院進行隔離。

初步調查顯示，他沒有接種猴痘疫苗，於潛伏期內曾在香港有高風險接觸。沒有資料顯示此個案與本港早前錄得的其他猴痘確診個案有流行病學關連，中心會繼續就個案進行流行病學調查，並將個案通報世界衞生組織（世衞）。

世衞本月初就猴痘舉行了特別會議，確認猴痘疫情仍然是國際關注的突發公共衞生事件。世衞繼續呼籲成員國加強對猴痘的監測及防控措施，以減低猴痘疫情的蔓延。香港自二○二二年六月起已制定猴痘準備及應變計劃，並於同年九月出現首宗猴痘確診個案後，啓動該計劃下的戒備級別。中心實施的一系列措施（包括加強個䅁監測、接觸者追蹤、公眾教育和疫苗接種等）在過去三年有效防止猴痘在本地出現爆發。

自二○二二年起至今，本港共錄得76宗猴痘個案（62宗本地個案和14宗輸入個案），當中八宗於今年錄得，全部病人均為男性。流行病學調查顯示，絕大部分個案曾進行高風險性行為，包括與陌生人發生性行為或在沒有配戴安全套的情況下進行性行為。香港至今未有發現新型猴痘病毒株（分支Ib型）的個案。

中心提醒高風險目標群組人士應接種猴痘疫苗，以減低感染或感染後出現較嚴重病徵的機會。此外，出現猴痘症狀（包括皮疹、發燒、發冷、淋巴結腫大、疲乏、肌肉痛及劇烈頭痛等）或懷疑自己受感染的人士應立即求醫並接受治療，不應與其他人進行可能接觸到皮疹或體液的活動。市民亦應時刻保持良好個人及手部衞生，預防經接觸傳播或感染病毒，並避免與懷疑感染猴痘的人或動物作密切身體接觸。

中心設有猴痘電話熱線（2125 2373），逢星期一至五（公眾假期除外）上午九時至下午五時運作。任何人懷疑或憂慮曾與確診病人有高風險接觸，尤其是男男性接觸者或曾與陌生人發生性行為，可致電熱線查詢及獲取相關的健康建議。

此外，衞生署為高風險群組提供接種猴痘疫苗服務，以下高風險目標群組人士可以自願形式接種猴痘疫苗：


曾進行高風險性行為，例如擁有多名性伴侶、性工作者、過去十二個月有性傳播感染史；
負責照顧猴痘確診病人的醫護人員；
處理動物傳染痘病毒的實驗室人員；及
當本港動物出現猴痘個案時有較高暴露風險的照顧動物人員。


高風險目標群組人士可於衞生署轄下全部社會衞生科診所（柴灣社會衞生科診所、灣仔男性社會衞生科診所、灣仔女性社會衞生科診所、油麻地男性社會衞生科診所、油麻地女性社會衞生科診所、容鳳書社會衞生科診所、粉嶺社會衞生科診所和屯門社會衞生科診所）及衞生署油麻地綜合治療中心接種猴痘疫苗，無須預約。

衞生署九龍灣綜合治療中心，以及醫院管理局伊利沙伯醫院和瑪嘉烈醫院的特別內科診所亦會為到診者提供猴痘疫苗接種服務。

市民可參閱衞生防護中心猴痘專頁及猴痘疫苗接種計劃專頁了解更多詳情。"
LCQ5: Measures to monitor condition of water mains,2025-06-18 19:10,2025-06-18 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800714.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Yung Hoi-yan and a reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

 The earlier fresh water quality incidents at Queen's Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court, as well as the water mains burst incident in Tuen Mun, have aroused public concern about the condition of water mains. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the staff establishment and work details of the working group established in connection with the water quality incidents at Queen's Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court, including the estimated number of times that the water tanks will be cleansed and the water quality will be tested, as well as the expenditures involved; whether the group will investigate if the incidents involved human negligence; of the total number of enquiries or requests for assistance from residents on water quality problems received by the offices of the two housing estates/housing courts so far;

(2) as the Water Supplies Department has indicated that it will replace all pipes in Hong Kong which are still coated with bitumen, of the distribution of the pipes concerned in various districts in Hong Kong at present, the names of the housing estates/housing courts involved, as well as the timetable for the relevant pipe replacement work; whether it has plans to inspect the fresh water supply systems of all housing estates/housing courts in Hong Kong to ascertain that they will not accumulate bitumen, resin or other impurities; if so, of the details (including the timetable, the manpower and the expenditure involved); if not, the reasons for that, and the measures in place to prevent similar incidents; and

(3) whether it has plans to enhance the application of technology and artificial intelligence to conduct 24-hour continuous monitoring and analysis of the conditions of water mains and water quality, so as to identify abnormalities in water mains at an early stage and carry out repairs; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 My reply to the questions raised by the Hon Yung Hoi-yan is as follows:

(1) The Government is highly concerned about the incident of bitumen sediments found in the fresh water at Queen's Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court. After receiving reports of black spots in the water at the end of May, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) and the Housing Department (HD) immediately formed a joint working group to conduct a joint investigation on the incident and formulate measures to resolve the issue. The working group is co-led by the Director of Water Supplies and the Deputy Director (Estate Management) of the HD, with members including 11 staff such as in-service engineers and property management professionals responsible for the operation of the water supply facilities and estate management in that area. The WSD has cleaned 11 times for the water mains under its management and maintenance, while the HD has conducted six and three times of cleaning of the water pipes and water tanks under its management respectively. The HD has also installed 22 screen filters at the water inlet of each building and the estates. The WSD continues to collect water samples from the estates for testing. So far, all samples have complied with the Hong Kong Drinking Water Standards.

 Since the establishment with promotion of the 24-hour hotline on June 7, the Government has received a total of about 700 enquiries. In addition, the WSD has received over 1 500 requests for flushing water meters through various channels, including street counters and home visits organised by the members of District Council, the three district committees and the Care Teams, and the WSD has completed the flushing of water meters within one to two days. Currently, most of the residents reported an improvement in water quality and follow-up action is not required.

 The WSD believes that the black sediments in the fresh water originated from a 400-metre-long steel water main at the upstream water supply network at Ping Che Road. This water main uses bitumen as an inner lining serving as a protective coating, and the sediment is likely residue that was flushed into the inside service of the estates before the installation of screen filters at the WSD's water mains by the end of 2022. We have set up an expert group consisting of the Chairman and two members of the Drinking Water Safety Advisory Committee (DWSAC) to assist with the traceability work. The expert group believes that the above assessment is reasonable. The WSD will submit an investigation report of the incident to the DWSAC for review in the near term.

 Learning from this experience, we should be able to make improvement in the aspects of the explanation process and handling time. We are now working at full steam on the various tasks and the expenditure involved is part of the expenditure of relevant departments in providing service, making it difficult to be separated out for the time being.

(2) Similar to Hong Kong, water mains with bitumen lining as protection still exist in the water supply systems of some advanced cities. The material is prone to peeling after prolonged use. The WSD has ceased applying bitumen lining on fresh water mains since 2005. At present, we have conducted further classification of water pipes that still contain this type of lining. Only about 230 km are fresh water distribution mains, representing roughly 3.9 per cent of Hong Kong's total fresh water distribution mains. The distribution of their locations is set out at Annex of the reply.

 While the bitumen used in water supplies facilities is inert and insoluble in water, any peeled tiny particles in the water supply can still cause worries among the public. To address this situation, the WSD has installed over 1 000 screen filters in the related water supply network taking into account the amount of peeling, complaint cases and population supplied with the water, etc. These filters effectively prevent peeling materials from entering the inside service of the buildings. The WSD is reviewing the necessity of installing additional screen filters at suitable locations, and revising the guidelines to advise property management companies on the methods to maintain water mains and screen filters.

 To expedite the decommissioning of the water mains with bitumen lining at Ping Che Road related to Queen's Hill incident, the WSD has explored to adopt an out-of-the-box approach over the past week by using exposed temporary water mains. They, together with the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the contractor, collaborate with the Transport Department, the Hong Kong Police Force and the North District Office on inter-departmental and collaborative basis to formulate traffic arrangements. Despite busy traffic conditions and narrow work space of the site, through collective efforts, the WSD will immediately commence the project and work around the clock to complete the temporary water mains by early July. In other words, this section of bitumen lining steel water mains will decommission from early July onwards. The WSD will also strive to replace the exposed temporary water mains with a permanent underground water mains by the end of this year.

 Last year, the WSD obtained funding approval from the Legislative Council for replacing or rehabilitating about 20 km (Note) of steel mains with bitumen lining on the inner wall. In response to this incident and ageing water mains burst, the WSD will submit short and medium term proposals for water mains replacement to the DEVB for review. We expect to discuss this at the meeting of the Panel on Development next month.

(3) The WSD will expand the monitoring area of Water Intelligent Network (WIN) to include fresh water trunk mains and all fresh water distribution mains. The sensors used for monitoring the water flow and pressure will also be upgraded to expedite the identification and repair of water mains with potential burst risk. The entire project is expected to be completed in 2027. We have asked the WSD to explore the possibility of early completion.

 The WSD will collaborate with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University to set up the joint laboratory of ""In-line Robot"" this August to conduct high-precision inspections of water mains.

 As regards the monitoring of water quality, the WSD has installed 24-hour online water quality monitoring systems in some key reservoirs and water treatment works. In addition, the WSD randomly collects water samples from some 28 000 consumers' taps in Hong Kong for testing every year. The sampling ratio, testing methods, and parameters covered adhere to international standards. The WSD has also commenced a study since 2023 to construct more water quality monitoring points in the water supply network in the following few years to enhance the alert capability. The study is expected to be completed within this year.

 Thank you, President.

代主席：

我感謝陳祖恒議員提出的議案、嚴剛議員提出的修正案，以及其他29位議員提出的建議和想法。接下來，我會就議員提出的意見作綜合回應。

正如剛才很多位議員都提及當下環球市場出現東升西降的變化，特別是內地企業發展迅速而市場龐大，我們處於最有利的位置，能同時爭取北上和南下的商機。

在招商引資方面，今年首四個月內，投資推廣署共協助了223間內地和海外企業，較去年同期增長13%。我們會繼續聯同相關機構、商會及專業團體積極向內地及海外潛在投資者及企業推廣香港的獨特優勢和大灣區建設及「一帶一路」倡議等帶來的機遇，吸引更多企業落戶香港。

此外，香港貿易發展局（貿發局）在舉辦國際展覽會議和投資推廣活動時，會安排環球投資項目對接環節及商貿配對服務，提供香港設計、品牌管理、文化創意、授權等專業服務的對接機會，助力內地企業拓展海外市場。貿發局將於二○二五年在內地舉辦融資沙龍，吸引內地企業來港上市，並組織行業考察前往中東及東南亞國家聯盟，協助香港各界與內地企業併船出海。

在金融領域合作方面，我們會繼續把握香港在「一國兩制」下金融體系的獨特優勢和國家對大灣區金融開放創新的支持，透過各種措施開拓新市場及吸引新資金，例如香港交易及結算所有限公司和證券及期貨事務監察委員會剛於今年五月推出「科企專線」，向特專科技和生物科技公司在提交上市申請前提供專門指引；在過去一年，政府先後在北京、上海和寧波舉辦了投資香港推介大會上市專場，向內地企業介紹香港上市的程序和便利措施；香港會計師公會也整合了一份涵蓋超過80家專門助力內地企業出海的香港會計師事務所名單。

知識產權署會持續聯繫內地、地區和國際組織，推廣香港作為區域知識產權貿易中心的角色，並與貿發局及持份者合作，透過商貿考察團、研討會推廣知識產權貿易及專業服務，包括與貿發局舉辦年度的亞洲知識產權營商論壇。貿發局亦會增加商務配對活動和提供更多知識產權貿易的市場資訊，加強支援本地原創作品打入內地及國際市場。

同時，商經局亦繼續透過專業服務協進支援計劃，鼓勵合資格的團體及機構善用計劃資源，以促進本港專業服務的發展。至今，已有超過120個項目獲得主計劃資助，涵蓋多個專業範疇，從能力提升課程到國際交流活動，為業界創造更多機遇。這些項目有助鞏固香港作為國際專業服務樞紐的領先地位，進一步為本港的中小企業帶來商機。

因應內地市場的需求持續增長，特區政府會繼續把握CEPA（《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》）下內地給予香港的優惠措施，助力香港企業和專業人才為內地市場提供優質產品和服務。在服務貿易方面，大灣區市場在多個範疇以先行先試的方式對香港作更大程度開放，讓香港服務提供者在大灣區市場提供更多樣化的專業服務，推動大灣區服務貿易的發展。

為協助中小企業發展跨境電子商貿（電商）等新業態、新模式，除了我在開場發言時提到的「電商易」之外，我們亦透過貿發局推行「電子商務快綫」、舉辦第二屆「香港好物節」等，加強協助企業提升品牌曝光度，開拓境外電商市場。同時，我們會透過四個中小企服務中心加強向企業發放電商資訊，工業貿易署今年亦會推出營商導師計劃，加強支援中小企業發展品牌和拓展電商銷售的網絡。

結語

代主席，儘管全球貿易格局和地緣政治不斷變化，為香港經濟帶來不明朗因素，政府會積極鞏固香港作為國家南大門的地位，發揮內聯外通的獨特優勢，透過「立足本地、聯動灣區、拓展國際」的策略，加大力度深化國際交往合作，在複雜多變的全球貿易格局下，力求化危為機，善用我們聯通國家與世界雙向平台的重要角色，吸引更多內地和海外企業落戶香港發展，同時協助香港企業開拓內地市場的商機，以增強香港經濟的發展動能。

代主席，我謹此陳辭。"

  Non-Hong Kong dealers can make an online submission of a cash transaction report via the Regime's webpage at www.drs.customs.gov.hk by accessing the Dealers in Precious Metals and Stones Registration System. They can also download the related form at www.drs.customs.gov.hk/download/drsform/CED418_Form%208_Cash%20transaction%20report.pdf and then submit the report in person at Hong Kong Customs' booth at the JGA.

  The Hong Kong Customs' booth (Booth 1B330) is located at HKCEC Hall 1B and will be open from 10am to 6pm between June 19 and 21 and from 10am to 5pm on June 22.

Customs officers intercepted two incoming male passengers, both aged 44, at Hong Kong International Airport on March 11. A total of about 57 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes and about 68 200 alternative smoking products, with an estimated market value of about $440,000 and a duty potential of about $190,000 in total, were seized from their personal baggage. They were subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

立法會：勞工及福利局局長就《2025年僱傭（修訂）條例草案》恢復二讀辯論發言全文（只有中文）,2025-06-18 18:00,2025-06-18 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800662.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上就《2025年僱傭（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）恢復二讀辯論的發言全文：

主席：

《2025年僱傭（修訂）條例草案》今日得以恢復二讀辯論，我首先感謝法案委員會主席葉劉淑儀議員、副主席梁子穎議員、法案委員會其他委員，以及立法會秘書處的全力配合和支援，讓《條例草案》的審議工作順利完成。另外，我亦非常感謝今日共有16位議員發言，在剛才的二讀辯論中表達他們的意見。

《條例草案》修訂《僱傭條例》下「連續性合約」規定的工作時數，即大家統稱的工時門檻。現行規定，俗稱「4-18」，即僱員如連續受僱於同一僱主四星期或以上，而每星期工作18小時或以上，已沿用多年。基於勞動市場的變化，以及為了讓僱員更容易享有《僱傭條例》下全面的權益，政府於二○二二年啓動檢討有關規定。勞工顧問委員會（勞顧會）深入討論後，於二○二四年二月就檢討達成共識。按勞顧會達成的共識修訂「連續性合約」規定，是《行政長官2024年施政報告》公布的其中一項重要的勞工支援措施。

《條例草案》修訂《僱傭條例》附表一有關「連續性合約」規定的工時門檻，包括兩個主要元素：一、每星期的工時門檻由18小時降低至17小時；二、提供另一個以指定四星期工時合計為一個計算單位的方法，如僱員某星期的工時及緊接過去三星期的合計工時達68小時，則即使該星期的工時少於17小時，該星期亦會被計算在連續性僱傭合約內。

修訂後《僱傭條例》的其他條文會繼續應用，僱員現時獲取各項法定權益的資格仍然維持不變，現時已符合「連續性合約」規定的僱員亦不受影響。

這次修訂降低「連續性合約」規定的工時門檻，並在計算工時方面加入彈性，讓僱員更容易符合修訂後的「連續性合約」規定，同時減少僱員因偶爾在某星期工時低於門檻便中斷連續性受僱的情況。符合新規定的僱員，如同時滿足條例相關條件，例如年資，便可享有各項法定僱傭福利，包括法定假日薪酬、有薪年假等。另外，隨着較短工時僱員的權益得到改善，我們相信有助吸引更多人投入勞動市場。法案委員會委員普遍支持《條例草案》的修訂建議。

在今日的辯論中，我聽到各位議員提出幾個關注點：第一點以勞工派議員為主，擔心僱主會想辦法規避「連續性合約」的新規定。這裏我想表達一個意見，但凡任何規定總有方法被繞過，問題是成本和難度有多高，所以修訂新的「4-68」規定，僱主要付出更高成本才可不符合這個要求，讓更多僱員受惠。我非常認同委員會主席葉劉淑儀所說的一個例子，她提到有不少的僱員尤其是婦女，提出認為不公允的地方——其上班時間並不短，但由於要四個星期連續計算，認為僱主到了第四個星期就把工時降到17小時或以下，故此一直無法成為「連續性合約」，因而享受不到其認為應有的僱員福利。

勞顧會討論了這麼長時間，這也正是邵家輝議員提到，大家就這點磋商了很久，但最後都秉承互諒互讓的精神而達成協議。我認為這牽涉大家認為是否公道。尤其是在調整工時方面，很多時僱主佔比較主導的地位，僱員是相對被動的身分，所以僱員希望我們在法例下面多給予他們保障，不要出現不公平狀況。我理解實剛才邵家輝指如果由僱員主導，他們又可以想辦法令自己「着數」，但這個是假設由僱員說了算，但現實上並不是。在實質的工作場景中，僱主僱員是互動的，無一方佔全部主動，所以大家一定要抱着互諒互讓的精神，即使在現時「4-18」規定下，如果全由僱員說了算，邵家輝議員所說的情景同樣可以發生。為何現時沒有發生呢？是因為調整工時安排時，僱主有一定的主導性，不會讓僱員在現有條件下得到所有好處，現時即使由「4-18」變「4-68」，也沒有改變以上的情況。

為何我會說這麼長？因為我很少見勞工派議員那麼苦口婆心地勸邵議員和其黨友，請大家支持經過勞顧會多年磋商，難得達成共識的意見。我在這裏也參與其中，苦口婆心勸邵議員和各位黨員，想一想由「4-18」變「4-68」是經過很長時間的商討，在勞顧會中爭論了很久。今日大家所說不同的情景——對方如何出蠱惑，另一方又會如何應對——通通都談過了。勞顧會的勞方和資方代表是同等比例，在這麼艱難的狀況下大家也可以談攏，為何來到議會卻不可接受勞顧會磋商已久的方案？我明白大家可能認為現時營商環境比較困難，但法律的修訂並非用於一時三刻，法例的修訂是千秋萬世的。

我們花了這麼多時間，希望香港不斷進步，在可行範圍內，香港作為一個先進發達的社會，是否應該對勞方僱員作一些合理的關顧？尤其是大家覺得，原以為長期替你工作，明明每個月的總工時很長，但當中總有一個星期叫僱員減少工作，突然關注讓僱員的休息時間，那是否對僱員公平呢？我只想提出這個看法，這個看法正正在勞顧會上談了很久，開端是由我本人擔任勞工處處長時，到我做了局長，新處長上任，大家一直在談這個問題。政府樂見勞顧會中勞資雙方互諒互讓，從對方的角度去想問題，然後達成共識。老實說這個方案資方要讓步、勞方同樣都要讓步，只有雙方各讓半步，大家才可以結伴走。

我希望今日是一個真正的辯論，大家各抒己見，我真的很希望通過辯論，如果仍然有異議的議員，還有幾分鐘時間，大家想一想是否應該顧全大局，顧及勞顧會花了這麼多時間商討，從一個互諒互讓的角度去決定如何投今日的一票。我希望通過這次的辯論，大家可以為香港的整體利益作出表態。

另外，我知道大家都非常關心平台工作者。目前，平台工作者大多數並非僱員的身分，因為他們並不符合僱員的定義要求，是屬於一個新形態的工作。就大家都關心的平台工作者，我們已同一時間開展工作，尤其針對他們最關注的範疇──在他們發生意外後的補償及後續處理，我們會做好工夫的。但是他們大多數的身分不是僱員，如果他的工作形態是僱員的話，即使他們是平台工作者，一樣是受僱傭條例的保障。

主席，我相信今日大多數議員和政府都有共同目標，就是讓《條例草案》盡早獲得通過。如獲立法會通過，修訂條例會在刊憲後六個月的首個星期日生效，讓僱主和僱員有充分時間作好準備。其間政府會經各途徑宣傳和解說，並會以淺白易明的方式向公眾解釋修訂條例，提高僱主及僱員對修訂條例的認識。政府亦會在修訂條例實施後，監察勞資關係的變化和情況。

我懇請各位議員支持及通過政府提出的《條例草案》，讓我們盡快展開下一階段的工作，讓「打工仔」早日受惠。

主席，我謹此陳辭。"

立法會十四題：公共與私營場所的家庭友善設施,2025-06-18 17:20,2025-06-18 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800557.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上顏汶羽議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

據悉，平等機會委員會的研究團隊對香港商場及政府處所進行了育嬰及哺乳設施的審核，結果顯示部分商場和政府處所尚未設置育嬰及哺乳室，並且部分現有育嬰空間的面積未符合屋宇署《在商業樓宇提供育嬰間及哺集乳室》作業備考（作業備考）的建議面積。關於公共與私營場所的家庭友善設施，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，公共與私營場所中育嬰及哺乳設施的數量、分布情況、所佔面積比例，以及當中設施符合作業備考建議面積的比率，並按全港18區分項列出相關數據；

（二）是否已就促進公共場所設置育嬰及哺乳設施的相關措施展開研究，包括強制要求新建的公營設施（例如圖書館、公園、海灘、體育場館等）設置育嬰及哺乳設施，並推動現有公營設施進行適當改建和加裝育嬰及哺乳設施；若是，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）除提供建築面積寬免外，有否考慮通過政策優惠措施，鼓勵私營場所提供育嬰及哺乳設施，以及家庭友善車位，並利用行政措施或立法長遠推動該等設施的建設；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

國際文獻及研究顯示，母乳是嬰兒最理想的食物。母乳既安全衞生，亦含有抗體，有助於預防許多常見的兒童疾病。餵哺母乳的兒童在智力測驗中表現較佳，而且較少機會出現超重或肥胖等情況，日後罹患糖尿病的機會亦較低。

政府一直循多方面致力推廣、維護及支持母乳餵哺。政府於二○一四年成立了「促進母乳餵哺委員會」，成員包括來自相關的醫護專業團體、學術界及參與推廣母乳餵哺的組織代表，就加強推廣、維護和支持母乳餵哺有關的策略及行動計劃提供具體建議，目標是提高母乳餵哺的持續性，並令母乳餵哺成為社會大眾接受的育嬰模式。此外，政府一方面推動公共場所成為「母乳餵哺友善場所」，支持授乳母親隨時餵哺孩子或擠母乳，另一方面亦積極在母嬰健康院及公立醫院推行「愛嬰醫療機構」認證，以加強對出院後授乳母親的專業支援。現時，共有15間母嬰健康院獲「愛嬰醫療機構」認證。此外，全港八間設有婦產科的公立醫院和一間私家醫院已獲認證為「愛嬰醫院」。

就顏汶羽議員的提問，經諮詢衞生署、醫院管理局（醫管局），以及相關政策局和政府部門後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）根據衞生署的紀錄，截至二○二五年六月十五日，設於政府部門或公共機構處所內的育嬰間共有422間（分項數字載於附件一及二），當中包括不同類別的場所，例如醫院、母嬰健康院、文康設施、社區會堂及屋邨商場等。

為推廣私人商業樓宇設置育嬰間，屋宇署於二○○九年二月發出有關《在商業樓宇提供育嬰間設施》作業備考，並已於二○一八年十一月更新，鼓勵在私人商業樓宇內設置供公眾使用的育嬰間和供員工使用的哺集乳室。此外，屋宇署於二○二四年六月更新了綠色建築環境評估認證及總樓面面積豁免的要求，容許尋求認證的發展項目透過設置育嬰間及哺集乳室爭取認證評分及總樓面面積豁免。

（二）及（三）政府一直積極透過各種不同政策措施，推動更多公共和私營場所設置育嬰及哺乳設施。

政府已在二○○八年八月制定《育嬰間設置指引》，鼓勵在政府管理的公共場所設置育嬰間。為加強設置育嬰及哺乳設施，自二○一九年初起，政府規定於新落成政府處所設置供公眾和員工使用的育嬰及哺乳設施。其中，就問題第二部分提及的公營設施，康樂及文化事務署已按相關規定將育嬰間設定為標準設施，在策劃新的大型文娛康樂設施和進行場地改善工程時增設有關的育嬰設施。

另外，政府已自二○一七年起，在新推售的商業用地（不包括酒店專屬用地）的賣地條件列出詳細的規定，包括在該等商業發展項目須設置的育嬰間及／或哺乳設施的面積和數目。截至二○二五年五月底，政府已在八幅新商業用地的賣地條件中加入相關要求。

與此同時，政府會繼續聯同社會各界緊密合作，加強醫護界對授乳母親的專業支援之餘，透過不同途徑在社區加強宣傳母乳餵哺，以期推動社會積極支持母乳餵哺的文化和創造便利母乳餵哺的友善環境。重點工作包括：

（i） 衞生署轄下正提供服務的29間母嬰健康院中已有15間獲得「愛嬰醫療機構」認證，其餘的母嬰健康院亦已陸續開展認證程序。母嬰健康院會訂立嬰兒餵哺政策及行動計劃、為員工提供相關培訓，以及持續監察母乳餵哺支援措施的落實情況等。衞生署會繼續加快為母嬰健康院取得「愛嬰醫療機構」認證，以加強醫療機構及人員對哺乳母親的專業支援；

（ii） 繼續與「促進母乳餵哺委員會」下的工作小組跟進相關工作，以加強及鞏固產科醫院（包括公立和私營醫院）的母乳餵哺友善措施；

（iii） 鼓勵實施「母乳餵哺友善工作間」政策，並已為僱主和僱員推出指引，提供支持母乳餵哺的具體建議，以便在職母親返回工作崗位後繼續餵哺母乳；以及

（iv） 透過大眾傳播媒介、社交媒體及大型活動等加強宣傳和倡導母乳餵哺。其中，衞生署在二○二四年十一月與醫管局、香港私家醫院聯會、聯合國兒童基金香港委員會和愛嬰醫院香港協會舉辦了大型母乳哺育研討會。本地和外地專家聚首一堂，與公私營醫療機構的代表、醫護專業人員及其他持分者分享有關母乳餵哺的不同議題，包括政策和專業支援。

為進一步支持母乳餵哺，政府於《行政長官2023年施政報告》提出在二○二五年成立母乳庫及建立母乳捐贈機制，為未能由其親生母親餵哺母乳的嬰幼兒提供母乳，尤其減低早產及重病嬰兒患上重症的機會。設於香港兒童醫院的香港母乳庫於二○二五年一月六日投入服務，同年四月獲得ISO 22000認證，並在二○二五年三月向全港九間設有新生兒深切治療部的公立醫院供應經處理的捐贈母乳。現時已有230多名登記母乳捐贈者，並收集超過900公升母乳，供應予極早產及患有危疾的初生嬰兒，讓他們獲得最佳營養。同時，公立醫院的新生兒深切治療部已向共120名有臨床需要的嬰兒派發經處理的捐贈母乳。

經諮詢相關政策局及政府部門，現時政府並無以泊車位作為家庭友善設施的相關定義及措施。"

  It is learnt that the research team of the Equal Opportunities Commission has conducted an access audit of babycare and lactation (B&L) facilities in shopping malls and government premises in Hong Kong, with the findings revealing that some shopping malls and government premises has not yet provided B&L rooms, and some existing babycare areas do not comply with the suggested size set out in the Buildings Department's Practice Note on ""Provision of Babycare Rooms and Lactation Rooms in Commercial Buildings"" (Practice Note). As regards family-friendly facilities in public and private premises, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the number, distribution and floor area ratio of B&L facilities in public and private premises, and the proportion of such facilities that complies with the suggested size in the Practice Note, together with a breakdown of such figures by the 18 districts across the territory;

(2) whether it has already commenced a study on measures to promote the provision of B&L facilities in public premises, including introducing mandatory requirements for newly-built public facilities (e.g. libraries, parks, beaches, sports venues) to provide B&L facilities, and motivating existing public facilities to renovate and retrofit B&L facilities as appropriate; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether, in addition to providing floor area ratio concessions, it has considered implementing policy incentives to encourage private premises to provide B&L facilities and family-friendly parking spaces, as well as using administrative measures or legislation to promote the development of such facilities in the long term; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

President,

  International literature and researches showed that breastmilk is the ideal food for infants. Breastmilk is safe, clean and contains antibodies which can help prevent many common childhood illnesses. Breastfed children perform better in intelligence tests, are less likely to be overweight or obese, and are less prone to have diabetes later in life.

  The Government has all along been promoting, protecting and supporting breastfeeding through a multi-pronged approach. The Government has set up a Committee on Promotion of Breastfeeding in 2014. Members include representatives from relevant professional healthcare bodies, academia as well as representatives of the organisations that have participated in the promotion of breastfeeding. The Committee provides specific recommendations on strategies and action plans to strengthen the promotion, protection and support for breastfeeding. Its objectives are to enhance the sustainability of breastfeeding and promote breastfeeding as the norm for babycare widely accepted by the general public. In addition to fostering the establishment of Breastfeeding Friendly Premises in public places such that breastfeeding mothers can breastfeed their children or express milk anytime, the Government also implements the Baby-Friendly Health Facility accreditation in the Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) and public hospitals to enhance the professional support to breastfeeding mothers after discharge from hospitals. At present, a total of 15 MCHCs have been accredited as Baby-Friendly Health Facilities. Besides, all eight public hospitals with obstetrics departments and one private hospital were accredited as Baby-Friendly Hospitals.

  In consultation with the Department of Health (DH), the Hospital Authority (HA), as well as relevant policy bureaux and government departments, the consolidated reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Ngan Man-yu is as follows:

(1) According to the DH's record, as at June 15, 2025, there were a total of 422 babycare rooms in the premises of government departments or public organisations (a breakdown of the numbers are at Annexes 1 and 2), which include various types of venues, such as hospitals, MCHCs, cultural and recreational facilities, community halls and shopping centres of housing estates.

  To promote the provision of babycare rooms in private commercial buildings, the Buildings Department (BD) issued the Practice Note on the Provision of Babycare Rooms in Commercial Buildings in February 2009 and had made further updates in November 2018 to encourage the provision of babycare rooms for the public and lactation rooms for staff in private commercial buildings. In June 2024, the BD updated the requirements for Building Environmental Assessment Method Plus certification and gross floor area (GFA) concessions to allow development projects seeking certification to secure the points and GFA concession through the provision of babycare rooms and breastfeeding rooms.

(2) and (3) The Government has been actively promoting the provision of more babycare and breastfeeding facilities in both public and private premises through various policy measures.

  The Government developed the Advisory Guidelines on Babycare Facilities in August 2008 to encourage the provision of babycare rooms in public venues managed by the Government. To enhance the provision of babycare and breastfeeding facilities, the Government mandated the provision of babycare and breastfeeding facilities in the newly completed government premises since early 2019. Regarding the public facilities mentioned in part 2 of the question, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department has included babycare rooms as a standard provision in accordance with relevant requirements, and will provide babycare facilities in planning for new major cultural and recreational facilities, as well as venue renovation works.

  Additionally, since 2017, the Government has included requirements for the provision of babycare rooms and/or lactation rooms in the Conditions of Sale of new commercial land sale sites (excluding land designated for hotel use only). The Conditions of Sale specify detailed requirements, including the area and number of babycare rooms and/or lactation rooms that shall be provided in these commercial development projects. As at the end of May 2025, the Government incorporated these requirements in the Conditions of Sale of eight new commercial sites.

  Meanwhile, the Government will continue to work closely with various sectors of the society to strengthen the professional support for breastfeeding mothers in the healthcare sector while stepping up publicity on breastfeeding in the community through various channels, with a view to fostering a proactive culture of support for breastfeeding in the community and creating a friendly environment conducive to breastfeeding. Key initiatives include –

(i) among the 29 MCHCs currently providing services under the DH, 15 of them have been accredited as Baby-Friendly Health Facilities. Accreditation procedures have also commenced gradually for the remaining MCHCs. The MCHCs will formulate infant feeding policies and action plans, provide training for staff members, continue monitoring the implementation of breastfeeding support measures, etc. The DH will continue to expedite the accreditation of Baby-Friendly Health Facilities for MCHCs to strengthen the professional support offered by the healthcare institutions and staff members to breastfeeding mothers;

(ii) continuing to follow up on the relevant work with the working group under the Committee on Promotion of Breastfeeding to enhance and reinforce the breastfeeding-friendly measures at hospitals with obstetrics departments (including public and private hospitals);

(iii) encouraging the implementation of the Breastfeeding Friendly Workplace policy with guidelines issued for employers and employees with specific advice on supporting breastfeeding to support working mothers to continue breastfeeding after returning to work; and

(iv) stepping up publicity and advocacy for breastfeeding through mass media, social media platforms, large-scale events, etc. Among others, the DH, in collaboration with the HA, the Hong Kong Private Hospitals Association, the Hong Kong Committee for United Nations Children's Fund, and the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative Hong Kong Association, organised the large-scale Breastfeeding Symposium in November 2024, which brought together local and overseas experts to share with representatives of the public and private healthcare sectors, healthcare professionals and other stakeholders the various issues related to breastfeeding, including policies and professional support.

  To further support breastfeeding, the Government put forward in the Chief Executive's 2023 Policy Address the establishment of a breast milk bank and the related mechanism for breast milk donation in 2025. Such arrangement aims to provide breast milk for infants and young children who cannot be breastfed by their biological mothers, and especially, to minimise the chance of severe illness in premature and severely-ill babies. The Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank, located at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital, commenced operations on January 6, 2025, obtained ISO 22000 certification in April of the same year, and began supplying pasturised donor breast milk to all nine public hospitals in Hong Kong with neonatal intensive care units in March 2025. Currently, there are more than 230 registered breast milk donors. Over 900 litres of breast milk have been collected, providing optimal nutrition for extremely premature and severely-ill newborn babies. Meanwhile, neonatal intensive care units in public hospitals have already distributed pasturised donor breast milk to 120 infants with clinical needs.

  Meanwhile, having consulted the relevant policy bureaux and government departments, the Government currently does not have any relevant definitions and measures on the use of parking spaces as family-friendly facilities."
立法會十三題：醫藥分家,2025-06-18 17:15,2025-06-18 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800564.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上邵家輝議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

據悉，全球有不少地方已實施醫藥分家制度（即醫生負責診症和處方，而患者憑處方到社區藥房配藥）多年。有意見認為，此制度有提升用藥安全和專業分工、避免用藥受局限、推動患者分流、減少利益衝突，以及降低醫療成本等正面作用。然而，有本港的藥房和藥劑業界及社會人士爭取香港實施有關制度逾廿年，政府至今未有確切回應。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否研究，現時內地和海外有哪些地方已經實施或正計劃實施醫藥分家制度及其效益；

（二）鑑於有意見指出，本港公營及私營醫院已實施由醫生負責診症和處方、藥劑師負責配發藥物的安排，而藥劑師作為市民服用藥物前的最後專業把關者，已將與藥物有關的醫療事故風險大大減少，當局仍未將有關安排擴展至醫療系統各層面（包括讓病人憑公立醫院醫生或私人執業醫生的處方於合資格社區藥房配藥）的原因為何；

（三）過去10年，有否研究或採取具體行動，以在本港實施醫藥分家制度；如有，詳情（包括多年來未有在香港實施相關制度的原因）為何；如否，原因為何；及

（四）會否參考其他已實施醫藥分家制度的地方的成功經驗，盡早在香港實施該制度；如會，詳情和實施時間表為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就邵家輝議員提問的各部分，經諮詢衞生署、基層醫療署和醫院管理局（醫管局）後，現回覆如下：

一般而言，「醫藥分家」是指一般情況下只容許醫生為病人作出診斷病症和開出處方，而配發藥物給病人的工作則必須另行由註冊藥劑師或其監督下的配藥員進行。換言之，實施「醫藥分家」安排即表示需要把配藥這項醫生一直以來可以負責的工作，以法定形式指定由註冊藥劑師分開施行，同時規定醫生（包括家庭醫生）診所如無註冊藥劑師不得安排配藥。

政府留意到部分歐美國家和鄰近地區（包括韓國和中國台灣地區）有實施「醫藥分家」模式，主要目標是讓醫生和藥劑師能專注其專業範疇，希望藉此提升用藥安全。然而，這些地方仍有特定情況容許醫生提供藥物給就診病人，這些地方的實行經驗亦顯示「醫藥分家」可能降低市民配藥的便利性，有機會使醫療成本上升，並對市民求醫習慣帶來重大改變。事實上，世界各地的醫療體系（包括診症和配藥的分工）均有所不同，必須結合當地的專業發展、社會需求和城市規劃來制定合適的政策，因地制宜，平衡專業分工與便民需求，才能有效優化醫療資源分配，提升整體醫療服務效率與安全性。

現時香港的公營醫院、公營診所及私家醫院均一直採取由醫生負責診症和處方，藥劑師負責配發藥物的安排，以切合實際需要。在私家醫生診所方面，病人亦有權選擇要求私家醫生開出處方，由病人自行到社區內的持牌藥房由藥劑師配發藥物。政府一向十分重視私營診所的配藥安全。為確保對病人的保障，香港醫務委員會制定的《香港註冊醫生專業守則》（《守則》）包括有關向病人配處藥物的規定。根據現行的《守則》（二○二二年十月修訂）第9.2節規定，醫生如為病人配處藥物，醫生本人有責任確保藥物符合處方內容並已妥為標籤，然後才發給病人。醫生應該訂立適當的程序，並參照香港醫學會發出的《良好配藥操作手冊》的規定，確保藥物妥為標籤及配處。

香港醫療專業水平高，現行法例及相關醫療人員規管措施一直以來有效保障藥物安全。在考慮任何改變診症和配藥的安排時，應着重醫生、藥劑師和其他醫療專業人員之間的合作，並以病人的福祉為依歸。在香港實施「醫藥分家」對於現時醫療系統內醫生的角色、醫護專業人力需求及配套設施，以至基層醫療服務安排和成本效益等有深遠影響，必須從長計議。

政府現時沒有計劃強制實行「醫藥分家」，但會在推動基層醫療改革時令社區內家庭醫生和其他醫護專業，在提供全面和連貫的基層醫療服務上加強協作，包括繼續實施一系列「醫藥協作」安排，利用好社區內的持牌藥房和藥劑師，進一步便利市民診症配藥、降低醫療成本，並確保求醫用藥的安全性，同時讓市民可選擇其配藥安排。具體例子包括：

（1）藥劑師在基層醫療系統中一向在不同層面發揮積極作用，包括支援家庭醫生監察藥物依從性，以及與護士等醫護專業在促進健康和健康教育上合作，以互補協作的模式協助預防和管理疾病、推廣藥物安全、戒煙和疫苗接種。目前社區的專業藥劑服務及藥物配發服務亦未盡其用，藥劑師於基層醫療的角色亦有待加強。政府正按《基層醫療健康藍圖》推動建立以社區為本的跨醫療專業團隊，當中會加強藥劑師在跨專業醫護管理的角色，同時會推動社區藥房的發展，讓市民可以選擇在社區接受藥物諮詢服務，達致「小病在社區」的目標，具體措施包括：

（i）政府正籌備於二○二五年第四季制訂社區藥物名冊，以及於二○二六年第四季分階段推出社區藥房計劃，讓市民可選擇透過家庭醫生和社區藥房，更便捷地獲得價格相宜的基層醫療藥物，藥劑師亦會在過程中定期檢視病人的用藥劑量和療效，從而改善病人的用藥情況及減少藥物浪費；

（ii）基層醫療署正擬訂《基層醫療社區藥房指引》，建立社區藥房的服務標準和質素保證，以及規範社區藥房與基層醫療服務提供者的協作模式；基層醫療署亦將會安排為藥劑師、藥劑系學生和專業人員提供培訓課程，並把該課程納入香港藥劑業及毒藥管理局未來認可持續進修的要求，為制定涵蓋藥劑師的《基層醫療指南》作準備；以及

（iii）地區康健中心會與社區藥房組成網絡，加強社區藥物配發和藥劑諮詢服務，強化地區康健中心作為基層醫療服務樞紐的同時，也為市民提供專業的藥劑服務。

（2）現行醫管局的藥物送遞服務下，病人可以就診後安排把藥物送遞至家中或指定地址，或到醫管局協作藥房領取藥物，使用者需支付藥物費用及送遞費。當社區藥房計劃推出後，計劃下的藥劑師亦可為合資格的醫管局病人提供指定藥物名單中的藥物覆配服務，包括有需要時服用的藥物和一些治療慢性疾病的藥物，並可分期向病人配發，而病人只需要付醫管局的藥物費用，無需額外支付送遞費。

（3）藥物管理是病人護理的重要一環。在「醫健通+」五年發展計劃下，政府會通過醫健通平台的數據連接，整合不同醫護提供者的藥物紀錄及相關醫療服務。政府亦會研究推出電子處方，實現醫護提供者、藥房及相關持份者之間安全、實時和雙向的藥物紀錄連接，從而提高處方準確性、流程效率及藥物安全。為配合有關發展，政府今年已向立法會提交《2025年電子健康紀錄互通系統（修訂）條例草案》，為經由醫健通簽發或認證的電子醫療文件提供清晰法律框架，並在合適的情況下，讓政府指定醫健通作為某些醫療文件的單一簽發平台，以便集中管理和支援使用流程。

在上述的社區藥物名冊和社區藥房計劃下，「醫健通+」作為支援基層醫療服務的重要平台，將擔當醫管局、社區藥房及相關醫護提供者之間的關鍵橋樑。政府會配合未來社區藥房及基層醫療服務的協同發展，連結及整合醫管局及不同醫護提供者的藥物紀錄，支援藥物處方及配藥等藥物管理流程。另外，上述《基層醫療指南》分支指南內的服務提供者均需要參與醫健通，促進數據互通以提升醫療服務的連貫性。

（4）就第二層及第三層醫療涉及醫院和專科服務，政府一直致力提高私營醫療服務收費透明度，讓市民按其需要作出醫療決定前，已能掌握更充分的價目資料，事先預備所需的費用。醫務衞生局於今年五月九日向立法會衞生事務委員會簡介初步立法建議及長遠優化措施，包括推動醫療服務範圍及收費項目標準化，涵蓋監察藥物的處方和收費情況。政府正陸續約見持份者，包括醫療衞生界、保險業界、病人組織和學術機構等，就構思詳情進行更深入諮詢，以期於二○二六年提交規例草案，逐步落實相關優化措施。"
LCQ13: Separation of prescribing from dispensing of drugs,2025-06-18 17:15,2025-06-18 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800567.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Shiu Ka-fai and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

  It is learnt that the system of separating prescribing from dispensing of drugs (SPD) (i.e. doctors are responsible for consultation and prescription while patients go to community pharmacies for dispensing of drugs with their prescriptions) has been implemented worldwide for many years. There are views that such a system has the positive effects of enhancing drug safety and professional segregation of duties, avoiding limitations in the use of drugs, promoting patient triage, reducing conflicts of interests and lowering healthcare costs, etc. However, despite local pharmacies and the pharmaceutical trade as well as members of the community have been striving for implementing the system in Hong Kong for more than two decades, the Government has not given definite responses so far. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has studied which places in the Mainland and overseas have already implemented or are currently planning to implement SPD and its effectiveness;

(2) as there are views pointing out that the arrangement of doctors being responsible for consultation and prescription and pharmacists for dispensing drugs has already been implemented in public and private hospitals in Hong Kong, and that pharmacists, who are the last professional gatekeepers for members of the public before taking drugs, have greatly reduced the risk of drug-related medical incidents, of the reasons for not extending the arrangement to all levels of the healthcare system by the authorities (including allowing the dispensing of drugs in qualified community pharmacies to patients with prescriptions by doctors in public hospitals or private medical practitioners);

(3) whether it studied or took specific actions in the past decade to implement SPD in Hong Kong; if so, of the details (including the reasons for not implementing the relevant system in Hong Kong over the years); if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) whether it will make reference to the successful experience of other places where SPD has been implemented, with a view to implementing the system in Hong Kong as early as possible; if so, of the details and implementation timetable; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Department of Health (DH), the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) and the Hospital Authority (HA), the reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Shiu Ka-fai is set out below.

  Generally, ""Separation of Prescribing from Dispensing of Drugs"" (SPD) means that, under normal circumstances, doctors are only allowed to diagnose and prescribe medicines for patients, while the role of drug dispensing must be carried out separately by registered pharmacists or dispenser under registered pharmacist's supervision. In other words, implementation of SPD arrangement statutorily designates drug dispensing, which has all along been able to be performed by doctors, to be separately performed by registered pharmacists, and at the same time requires that drug dispensing cannot be carried out in doctor (including family doctor) clinics without the presence of a registered pharmacist.

  The Government notes that some European and American countries, as well as neighbouring regions (including Korea and China's Taiwan region), have adopted the mode of SPD. The main objective is to enable doctors and pharmacists to focus on their professional areas, with a view to enhancing medication safety. Nevertheless, there are specified exemptions in these places that allow doctors to supply medicines to patients who attend medical consultations. Meanwhile, the implementation experience of these places also shows that SPD may potentially reduce the convenience of the public in obtaining medications, increase medical cost, and bring about significant changes in people's healthcare-seeking habits. In fact, healthcare systems (including the division of labour between consultation and dispensing drugs) vary across the world. It is crucial to formulate appropriate policies in the light of local professional development, social needs and city planning. By taking into account the local conditions and balancing the division of labour among various professions with public convenience, the distribution of healthcare resources can be effectively optimised, and the efficiency and safety of healthcare services can be enhanced as a whole.

  At present, public hospitals, public clinics as well as private hospitals in Hong Kong have adopted the arrangement that doctors are responsible for consultation and prescription, while pharmacists are responsible for the dispensing of drugs, to meet the practical needs. As regards private doctor clinics, patients have the right to request prescriptions from private doctors and have their drug dispensed by pharmacists at licensed pharmacies in the community. The Government has always attached great importance to the safety of drug dispensing in private clinics. For patient protection, the Code of Professional Conduct (the Code) formulated by the Medical Council of Hong Kong includes provisions regarding the dispensing of drugs to patients. According to section 9.2 of the current Code (revised in October 2022), if a doctor dispenses medicine to patients, it is the doctor's personal responsibility to ensure that the drugs are dispensed strictly in accordance with the prescription and are properly labelled before they are handed over to the patients. Doctors should establish suitable procedures and observe the provisions of the Good Dispensing Practice Manual issued by the Hong Kong Medical Association to ensure that drugs are properly labelled and dispensed.

  Hong Kong has a high standard of medical professionalism, and the existing legislation and the relevant regulatory measures for healthcare personnel have been effective in safeguarding drug safety. When considering any changes in consultation and drug dispensing arrangements, emphasis should be placed on the co-operation among doctors, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals, and the well-being of patients should be the primary consideration. The implementation of SPD in Hong Kong will have far-reaching implications on the role of doctors in the current healthcare system, the manpower demand for healthcare professions and the ancillary facilities, as well as the arrangement and cost-effectiveness of primary healthcare services, etc, which must be considered on a long-term basis.

  The Government currently has no plan to make SPD mandatory, but will enable family doctors and other healthcare professions in the community to enhance their collaboration in the provision of comprehensive and coherent primary healthcare services while taking forward primary healthcare reform, including continuing to implement a series of ""medical-pharmaceutical collaboration"" arrangements to make good use of the licensed pharmacies and pharmacists in the community. This will further facilitate the public's access to medical consultation and dispensing of medicines, reduce medical cost, ensure the consultation and medication safety, and provide the public with choices of drug dispensing arrangements. Specific examples include:

(A) Pharmacists have been playing an active role in the primary healthcare system at different levels, including supporting family doctors in monitoring drug compliance, and collaborating with healthcare professions such as nurses in health promotion and health education to assist in the prevention and management of diseases, promotion of drug safety, smoking cessation and vaccination under a complementary and collaborative model. However, the existing professional pharmaceutical services and drug dispensing services in the community are not fully utilised, and the role of pharmacists in primary healthcare could be enhanced. The Government is promoting the establishment of community-based multi-disciplinary healthcare teams in accordance with the Primary Healthcare Blueprint, in which the role of pharmacists in multi-disciplinary healthcare management will be enhanced. At the same time, the Government will also promote the development of community pharmacies so that members of the public can choose to receive drug counselling services in the community, thereby achieving the goal of ""treating mild cases in the community"". Specific measures include:

(i) The Government is preparing to develop a community drug formulary in the fourth quarter of 2025 and will launch the community pharmacy programme (CPP) by phases starting from the fourth quarter of 2026 to enable the public to obtain affordable primary healthcare drugs more conveniently through family doctors and community pharmacies. In the process, pharmacists will also regularly review the dosage and efficacy of the drugs taken by patients to improve their use of medication and reduce drug wastage;

(ii) The PHC Commission is formulating the Guideline of Practice for Community Pharmacy to establish service standards and quality assurance for community pharmacies, and to standardise the collaborative model between community pharmacies and primary healthcare service providers. The PHC Commission will also arrange training courses for pharmacists, pharmacy students and professionals, which will be incorporated into the requirements of the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Hong Kong for recognising continuing education in the future , in preparation for the formulation of the Primary Care Directory (PCD) which will cover pharmacists; and

(iii) The District Health Centres (DHCs) will form a network with community pharmacies to enhance the dispensing of drugs in the community and pharmaceutical consultation services, so as to strengthen the role of DHCs as a hub for primary healthcare services, while at the same time providing professional pharmaceutical services to members of the public.

(B) Under the current HA medication delivery service, patients can arrange to have their medications delivered to their home or a specified address, or choose to collect them at a pharmacy in collaboration with the HA after their consultation. Users are required to pay for the medications and the delivery fee. After implementation of the CPP, pharmacists under the CPP will also be able to provide eligible HA patients with drug refill services for drugs on the designated drug list, including drugs to be taken when needed and drugs for chronic diseases, and may dispense the drugs in batches to patients. Patients are only required to pay the HA's medication fees with no additional delivery fees.

(C) Medication management is a vital part of patient care. Under the five-year development plan of ""eHealth+"", the Government will integrate the medication records and related healthcare services of various healthcare providers through data connectivity on the eHealth platform. The Government will also explore the introduction of ePrescription to enable secure, real-time and bi-directional connectivity of medication records among healthcare providers, pharmacies and relevant stakeholders, thereby enhancing prescription accuracy, process efficiency and medication safety. To support the relevant development, the Government has submitted the Electronic Health Record Sharing System (Amendment) Bill 2025 to the Legislative Council this year to provide a clear legal framework for electronic medical documents issued or authenticated through eHealth. Where appropriate, the Government may designate eHealth as the only platform for issuance of certain medical documents to facilitate centralised management and support usage process.

  Under the community drug formulary and CPP mentioned above, as an essential platform for supporting primary healthcare services, ""eHealth+"" will serve as a critical bridge between the HA, community pharmacies and relevant healthcare providers. The Government will support the future co-ordinated development of community pharmacies and primary healthcare services by connecting and integrating the medication records of the HA and various healthcare providers, facilitating medication management processes such as medication prescription and drug dispensing. In addition, service providers in the aforementioned sub-guidelines of the PCD are required to register with eHealth to facilitate data sharing, with a view to enhancing the continuity of healthcare services.

(D) For secondary and tertiary healthcare involving hospital and specialist services, the Government has been striving to enhance price transparency of private healthcare services, such that citizens could gain access to more comprehensive price information before making medical decisions according to their needs and better prepare for their expenses. On May 9, 2025, the Health Bureau briefed the Panel on Health Services of the Legislative Council on the preliminary legislative proposals and long-term enhancement measures, including the promotion of standardisation of the scope of healthcare services and chargeable items, covering the monitoring of drug prescription and charging. The Government is progressively engaging with stakeholders, including the healthcare sector, the insurance industry, patient organisations and academic institutions, to conduct more in-depth consultation on the details of the ideas, with a view to introducing the draft regulation in 2026 and implementing relevant enhancement measures by phases."
FS attends 2025 Lujiazui Forum (with photos),2025-06-18 16:42,2025-06-18 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800612.htm,"  The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, attended the 2025 Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai today (June 18) and witnessed the signing of the Action Plan for Collaborative Development of Shanghai and Hong Kong International Financial Centres.

  The Lujiazui Forum is an international high-level dialogue platform that discusses major issues in the financial sector. This year, the forum was jointly organised by the Shanghai Municipal Government, the People's Bank of China, the National Financial Regulatory Administration, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission. Themed ""Financial Opening-Up and Cooperation for High-Quality Development in a Changing Global Economy"", the forum has brought together government officials, financial regulators, industry leaders, renowned think tanks and scholars from multiple countries to discuss topics such as global monetary policy, capital market development, financial technology and innovation, and inclusive finance. The plenary session this afternoon will include a session on deepening the co-operation and development of Shanghai and Hong Kong as international financial centres.

  Mr Chan, as one of the key guests, attended the forum's opening ceremony and morning plenary session.

  Before the opening ceremony, Mr Chan and the Executive Vice Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Mr Wu Wei, jointly witnessed the signing of the Action Plan for Collaborative Development of Shanghai and Hong Kong International Financial Centres, by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, and the Director-General of the Shanghai Office for Advancing International Financial Center Development and Director of the Shanghai Municipal Financial Regulatory Bureau, Mr Zhou Xiaoquan.

  The Action Plan covers six areas with a total of 38 measures, including deepening the interconnectivity between Mainland and Hong Kong financial markets, enhancing the linkage and co-operation of the two places' capital markets, supporting eligible Shanghai enterprises to list and raise funds in Hong Kong, and strengthening collaboration in areas such as commodity trading, reinsurance, green finance and fintech. The aim is to further leverage the financial opening up, development and risk management advantages of the two cities, enhance cross-boundary and offshore financial co-operation, and promote the co-ordinated development of the two international financial centres.

  In his speech at the ceremony, Mr Chan said that the Action Plan further specifies the directions of co-operation between Hong Kong and Shanghai, thereby injecting new and richer content into multi-level and multi-field financial collaboration. It includes, first, new measures to deepen financial interconnectivity; second, highlighting support for Mainland enterprises to go global; and third, promoting standard alignment and financial innovation. With strong support from the country, Hong Kong and Shanghai, as two international financial centres, will join forces to create greater synergy and collaborative benefits, thus making greater contributions to the country's development as a financial powerhouse while also injecting Chinese wisdom and strength into the development of the global financial market.

  Yesterday (June 17), upon arriving in Shanghai, Mr Chan attended an international exchange dinner hosted by the China Finance 40 Forum. Attendees included leaders from domestic and international financial institutions, regulatory bodies, think tanks and academia. At the dinner, Mr Chan shared how Hong Kong is striving to promote high-quality financial development amid global political and economic changes. This includes advancing financial market reforms to better attract global capital to support the development of the real economy, supporting the prudent advancement of Renminbi internationalisation, embracing financial innovation including digital assets, and providing comprehensive, high value-added services for Mainland enterprises' international development. The goal is to better contribute to the country's financial reform and high-level opening up while creating opportunities for global investors and businesses.

  Mr Chan departed for Hong Kong around noon today."

環球市場持續波動，加上美國的單邊主義加深對全球市場的衝擊。但有危便有機，國家推動新質生產力發展，內地企業在高新科技的領域更是領先世界，香港會把握好機遇，加快創科發展以配合國家的戰略方向，同時充分發揮好「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色連接內地與全球市場，吸引內地具潛力的企業到港，善用香港的環球網絡和國際金融中心的功能。同時，政府會鼓勵港商更深更廣地開拓內地業務，把握國家雙循環策略帶來的龐大商機。

從近期各項數據可見，環球投資者對香港的信心正在增強。二○二四年有香港境外母公司的駐港公司總數達9 960間，其中內地駐港公司佔比最多，約有2 600間。商經局轄下的投資推廣署在去年協助了539間企業在港開設和擴展業務，按年增長超過四成，而與新質生產力相關的創新及科技業佔榜首，有120間之多。

因應環球地緣政治和貿易格局劇變，加上部分供應鏈正向「全球南方」及「一帶一路」沿線國家遷移，投資推廣署和香港貿易發展局（貿發局）已在去年底設立高增值供應鏈服務機制，吸引內地企業到港建立管理離岸貿易和供應鏈的國際或區域總部，以及提供一站式諮詢服務，協助內地企業出海。

商經局「一帶一路」辦公室協助中小企業與內地企業聯手開拓「一帶一路」商機。行政長官於五月率領由香港和內地企業代表組成的代表團前往卡塔爾和科威特訪問，與中東地區進一步建立政府之間的關係，成功推動多方面的成果，務實推動內地企業夥拍香港專業服務業，一同開拓環球機遇。

同時，貿發局透過大型國際會議、訪問團及外展活動，介紹香港機遇及作為雙向投資平台的角色，促進香港與內地企業、專業服務團隊和「一帶一路」沿線國家項目擁有者的合作。

在標準認證方面，三地認證機構等在工業消費品、農食產品和服務業等領域，建基於粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）共通執行的「灣區標準」，已開展高端的品質認證活動。政府會繼續推動有關「灣區標準」和「灣區認證」的工作，促進粵港澳三地互聯互通和融合發展。

香港致力為內地企業提供多元（例如銀行、證券、會計等）的金融專業服務和有效的投融資渠道。我們會繼續善用香港與內地和國際市場的連通優勢，強化全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐功能、深化兩地金融市場互聯互通，並對接國家高質量出海戰略，致力深化與「全球南方」新興市場的聯繫。

律政司推出並落實各項措施提升香港法律及爭議解決服務的國際競爭力。現時，已有超過560名港澳律師取得大灣區律師執業證，可在大灣區內地九市代理民商事案件。在CEPA（《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》）《服務貿易協議》下，「港資港法」措施的適用範圍由深圳前海擴展至深圳市及珠海市，而「港資港仲裁」措施則由內地自貿區進一步涵蓋大灣區內地九市。此外，粵港澳三地法律部門已發布統一的大灣區調解員名冊，大灣區仲裁員名冊的制定工作也正在有序推進中，進一步完善大灣區多元糾紛解決機制，讓企業更便利獲取商事仲裁和調解的服務。

在律政司支持下，大灣區線上爭議解決協作平台的主題網站於二○二四年七月正式推出，提供一站式有關大灣區內爭議解決服務的資訊，讓大灣區城市群中的主要仲裁、調解機構能有效作線上談判及業務合作，實現對大灣區仲調資源的整合。

國家知識產權局與世界知識產權組織共同確定香港生產力促進局為新一批技術與創新支持中心（TISC）的籌建機構。香港的TISC會聚焦向本地初創企業和中小企業提供優質的知識產權資訊及服務，協助它們開發創新潛力，創造、保護、管理和商品化其知識產權。

政府亦會積極協助中小企業利用大灣區為最佳切入點，拓展內地的內銷市場，把握龐大商機，包括透過貿發局的「GoGBA一站式平台」，舉辦各項活動和提供資訊，協助港商在大灣區建立人脈和促進商機。

此外，「BUD專項基金」（「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」）資助企業發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展營銷，在40個已與香港簽署自由貿易協定及／或促進和保護投資協定的經濟體發展業務。我們亦推出了「電商易」，鼓勵企業推行電子商貿項目，促進新質生產力和新業態融合發展。

結語

政府已積極展開上述各項工作，並會因應社會經濟情況和業界需要，不時檢討各項措施，以期協助企業（特別是中小企業）更好應對複雜多變的營商環境，同時促進外來投資，鼓勵更多內地企業落戶香港，以增強香港的經濟發展動能。

主席，我希望先聆聽各位議員對陳祖恒議員動議的意見，稍後在總結發言的時候作詳細回應。今日在席的政府同事亦有政制及內地事務局副局長和創新科技及工業局副局長，他們兩位稍後亦會就其政策局轄下的政策範疇作補充。

主席，我謹此陳辭。"

Through participating in a major film festival on the Mainland and organising project pitching sessions and screening events, Hong Kong films and emerging filmmakers could be promoted, increasing their exposure in the Mainland market and exploring development opportunities. The delegation included Assistant Commissioner for Cultural and Creative Industries and the Secretary-General of the FDC, Mr Gary Mak; directors Oliver Chan and Robin Lee; actors Hedwig Tam and Lo Chun-Yip; as well as Hong Kong directors Anselm Chan, Lawrence Kan, Mandrew Kwan, Paul Sze and Sunny Yip, and Hong Kong producers Lawrence Lau, Samuel Choy and Cora Yim, who attended the pitching sessions. The strong lineup showcased the strength and new blood of the Hong Kong film industry.

In his speech at the Hong Kong New Power Project Showcase Project Pitching Session of the SIFFORUM today (June 18), Mr Mak said that the Hong KongSpecial Administrative Region Government (HKSARG) has always been committed to fostering development of Hong Kong's film industry by supporting film productions and nurturing talent through various funding schemes, encouraging new filmmakers to create high-quality works and explore further and broader markets. In organising this project pitching session, the HKSARG hopes to enhance the visibility of Hong Kong's emerging filmmakers and foster investment partnerships, joining forces on all fronts to drive the high-quality development of Hong Kong and Mainland film industries.

To provide a platform to showcase upcoming Hong Kong film projects in development or production, and facilitate co-operation and investment, five new film projects were presented at the Hong Kong New Power Project Showcase Project Pitching Session, namely ""The Marriage Drive"", ""Open Fire"", ""Altarage"", ""Prison of Love"" and ""The Excreman - On the Road"", with project teams sharing their creative ideas and market potential of their projects with investors and filmmakers in attendance. Special guest mentors, including the Chief Executive Officer of Bona Film Group Co Ltd, Mr Jiang Defu; Senior Vice President of iQiyi Pictures, Mr Ya Ning; and director Anselm Chan were also invited to give professional advice to the project teams.

The CCIDA and the FDC also organised the Making Waves - Navigators of Hong Kong Cinema film programme, presenting seven Hong Kong films at the SIFF, including ""Montages of a Modern Motherhood"", ""An Abandoned Team"", ""Four Trails"" and the restored edition of four classics ""Father and Son"", ""Shanghai Blues"", ""The System"" and ""PTU"". Director Oliver Chan, actors Tam and Lo of ""Montages of a Modern Motherhood"", and director Robin Lee of ""Four Trails"" participated in the post-screening discussions of their films."

《條例草案》修訂「連續性合約」規定的工作時數（工時）門檻，包括將每星期的工時門檻由18小時降低至17小時；及提供另一個以指定四星期工時合計為一個計算單位的方法，如僱員某星期的工時及緊接過去三星期的合計工時達68小時，則即使該星期的工時少於17小時，該星期亦被視為在連續性僱傭期內。

政府發言人說：「自《僱傭條例》實施至今，『連續性合約』規定的工時門檻一直維持在每星期18小時。這次修訂降低『連續性合約』規定的工時門檻，並在計算工時方面加入彈性，減少僱員因偶爾在某星期工時低於門檻便中斷連續性受僱的情況。」

發言人補充：「修訂後《僱傭條例》的其他條文會繼續如常應用，僱員現時享有各項法定權益的資格維持不變，已符合現行『連續性合約』規定的僱員不受影響。」

《2025年僱傭（修訂）條例》將於六月二十七日刊憲。經修訂的「連續性合約」規定將於二○二六年一月十八日起適用，其間政府會經不同途徑宣傳和解說，並會以淺白易明的方式向公眾解釋修訂條例，提高僱主及僱員對修訂條例的認識。"

  The Bill revises the working hours threshold of the ""continuous contract"" requirement, which includes lowering the weekly working hours threshold from 18 hours to 17 hours; and providing an alternative of using the aggregate working hours in a specified four-week period as a counting unit in which a week with less than 17 working hours will still be regarded as a continuous employment period if the sum of the working hours of that week and those of the three weeks immediately preceding it reaches 68 hours.

  A Government spokesman said, ""Since the implementation of the EO, the working hours threshold of the 'continuous contract' requirement has been maintained at 18 hours per week. This amendment exercise lowers the working hours threshold of the 'continuous contract' requirement and introduces flexibility in the calculation of working hours, reducing the circumstances of disrupting the continuity of an employee's employment because the working hours of a week occasionally fall below the threshold.

  ""After the amendments, other provisions of the EO will continue to operate as they currently do, and existing eligibility criteria for employees to enjoy various statutory benefits will remain unchanged. Employees who have met the current 'continuous contract' requirement will not be affected,"" the spokesman added.

  The Employment (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 will be gazetted on June 27, 2025. The revised ""continuous contract"" requirement will be effective from January 18, 2026, onwards. In the meantime, the Government will publicise and brief the public on the Amendment Ordinance through various channels, presenting it in layman's terms to enhance employers' and employees' understanding."

（iv）租戶未有按規定交回或拒絕交回有關入息及資產的申報表而遷出；
（v）租戶的家庭入息／總資產淨值超過「富戶政策」指明的限額而遷出；

答覆：

主席：

就葛珮帆議員的提問，我們現回覆如下：

（一）過去五個財政年度（即二○二○／二一至二○二四／二五年度），香港房屋委員會（房委會）收回的公共租住房屋（公屋）單位數目按其原因載列於附件一。

（二）房委會按照既定的配額政策及計劃，編配新建成及回收後經翻新的公屋單位，以配合各類別申請者的需求。我們會把大部分的單位編配予公屋申請者，並會密切監察其他類別（例如體恤安置類別）的實際編配數字，以確保任何在其他編配類別下多出預計需求的單位會在年度終結前編配予公屋申請者。過去五個財政年度實際編配予公屋申請者和其他類別申請者的回收公屋單位數目載列於附件二。

（三）過去五個財政年度，房委會發出「遷出通知書」的數目，上訴委員會（房屋）接獲的上訴個案數目，以及經上訴委員會（房屋）審理的上訴個案數目和裁決結果按類載列於附件三。

（四）按房委會現行的「批出新租約政策」，公屋戶主離世或遷出後，單位的租約可批予名列於戶籍內的戶主配偶。若戶籍內並無戶主的在生配偶，現居單位內的其中一位認可家庭成員，只要通過定於「富戶政策」水平的「全面經濟狀況審查」及「住宅物業權審查」，便可獲批新租約。在過去五個財政年度，因原戶主離世或遷出而批出的新租約個案約有32 000宗。房屋署沒有備存拒絕批出新租約申請和批出新租約個案中曾獲批增加戶籍成員的統計數字。

（五）過去五個財政年度，房委會批准刪除公屋家庭成員戶籍的個案平均每年約44 000宗，當中約16 700宗為離世或入住安老院舍個案，其餘約27 300宗因遷出或其他原因而獲批刪除戶籍。房屋署並沒有備存獲批准刪除戶籍的個案中多少屬於「富戶」的統計數字。

（六）過去五個財政年度，房委會轄下需要繳交倍半及雙倍淨租金另加差餉的公屋租戶數目載列於附件四。"

Question:

  According to government information, 15 000-odd public rental housing (PRH) units were recovered by the Housing Department for various reasons in 2023, which was 55 per cent more than the annual number of about 10 000 units in the past. Regarding the recovery of PRH units and the Well-off Tenants Policies, will the Government inform this Council of the following information in the past five financial years:

(1) the number of PRH units recovered each year for the following reasons:
(i) death of principal tenants or principal tenants being admitted to residential care homes;
(ii) principal tenants having purchased subsidised sale flats;
(iii) tenants moving out due to breach of tenancy agreements (e.g. ‍accruing 16 points within two years under the Marking Scheme for Estate Management Enforcement or defaulting on rent payment);
(iv) tenants moving out due to failure or refusal to return the declaration form on income and assets as required;
(v) tenants moving out as their family income/total household net asset value exceeded the limits prescribed under the Well-off Tenants Policies;
(vi) tenants were asked to move out as their household members owned domestic properties in Hong Kong;
(vii) voluntary surrender of units by tenants (including moving to other regions/countries, moving to other residences, or for unknown reasons);
(viii) tenants moving out upon application for transfer; and
(ix) other reasons;

(2) the number of recovered PRH units used for allocation to applicants on the PRH Waiting List each year;

(4) the number of cases received by the HA in which applications for granting of new tenancy agreements were made by authorised members of the units due to the death or moving out of the original principle tenants and, among such cases, the number of those which were approved and rejected; among the approved cases, the number of those in which the PRH units involved were granted approval for addition of household members to the tenancy in the past three years;

(5) the number of PRH tenants who had successfully applied for deletion of household members from the tenancy each year and, among them, the number of those who were well-off tenants; and

(6) the respective numbers of PRH tenants who were required under the Well-off Tenants Policies to pay (i) 1.5 times net rent plus rates and (ii) double net rent plus rates each year?

Reply:

President,

  In response to the questions raised by the Hon Elizabeth Quat, our reply is as follows:

(1) In the past five financial years (i.e. 2020/21 to 2024/25), the numbers of public rental housing (PRH) units recovered by the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA), categorised by reasons for recovery, are listed in Annex 1.

(2) Based on the established allocation policies and programmes, the HA allocates newly completed and refurbished recovered PRH units to meet the needs of applicants under various categories. We will allocate most of the units to PRH applicants and closely monitor the actual allocation figures of other categories (e.g. Compassionate Rehousing) to ensure that any units in excess of the estimated demand under other categories would be allocated to PRH applicants by the end of the year. In the past five financial years, the actual numbers of recovered PRH units allocated to PRH applicants and applicants under other categories are tabulated in Annex 2.

(3) In the past five financial years, the numbers of Notices-to-quit issued by the HA, the numbers of appeal cases received by the Appeal Panel (Housing), and the numbers of appeal cases heard by the Appeal Panel (Housing) as well as the rulings are set out by category in Annex 3.

(4) According to the HA's existing Policy on Grant of New Tenancy (GNT), upon the death or moving out of the principal tenant of a PRH unit, the tenancy can be granted to his/her spouse who has been listed in the tenancy. If there is no surviving spouse listed in the tenancy, one of the authorised family members currently living in the unit can be granted a new tenancy, provided that the Comprehensive Means Test and Domestic Property Test set at the level of Well-off Tenants Policies are passed. In the past five financial years, there were approximately 32 000 GNT cases approved upon the death or moving out of the original principal tenant. The Housing Department (HD) does not keep statistics on the number of rejected applications for GNT and the number of approved GNT cases which involved addition of household members.

(5) In the past five financial years, the HA approved an average of about 44 000 cases per year on the deletion of family members from PRH tenancies. Among these cases, around 16 700 cases arose from death or admission to elderly homes, while the remaining of about 27 300 cases resulted from moving out or other reasons. The HD does not keep statistics on the number of aforesaid cases which involved ""well-off tenants"".

(6) In the past five financial years, the numbers of PRH tenants under the HA required to pay 1.5 or double net rent plus rates are listed in Annex 4."

問題：

有意見認為，隨着香港人口結構變化，預計無主物業的數量將持續增加，對社會資源分配和管理構成潛在挑戰。據報，近年有團夥利用無主物業謀取不法利益，例如將物業非法轉讓或用作借貸，甚至申請逆權管有，顯示無主物業的監管出現缺口。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）現時地政總署管理的無主物業（即該等本由某公司持有，而該公司已根據《公司（清盤及雜項條文）條例》（第32章）或《公司條例》（第622章）解散的物業）的具體數目為何；過去五年，政府處置該類物業的詳情（包括處理進展）為何；

（二）有否統計，全港曾由私人名義持有的無主物業數目；政府目前有否相關機制處理該類物業；若否，會否考慮建立專項措施或機制以防範利用該等無主物業進行不法行為；若有，詳情為何，以及政府在處理該等無主物業的過程中，會否徵收行政費用及訂定清晰的收費標準；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為，管理無主物業（包括曾由私人或公司持有的無主物業）涉及多個政府部門的權責，政府有否制訂跨部門協調機制以提升有關工作的效率；若否，有否計劃就有關工作進一步加強跨部門協作？

無主物業一般指一些原本由個人或公司持有的物業，但該物業擁有人後來去世而無人申索其遺產，又或者該公司被清盤和解散。根據現行法律，個人或公司持有的物業會按不同法例處理，以確保物業的合法擁有人或承繼人的權益不會被侵犯，以及當物業成為無主物業後獲得妥善處理。

就個人持有的物業而言，《遺囑認證及遺產管理條例》（第10章）賦予法院處理與遺囑認證及遺產管理相關事宜的管轄權，包括處理無人申索的遺產。若無人申索的遺產中涉及物業資產，該物業會按適當方式處置，包括出售物業。

由公司持有的物業，在其清盤及解散過程中，清盤人會出售公司持有的財產，以償還未清的債項。如果某公司根據《公司條例》（第622章）或《公司（清盤及雜項條文）條例》（第32章）完成清盤程序並面臨解散，則在緊接解散前歸屬該公司或以信託形式為該公司持有的所有財產及權利（例如包括一些仍未在市場售出的物業），即屬無主財物並歸屬政府。若該些無主財物屬土地物業，會由地政總署代政府處理。

過去五年（由二○二○年六月至二○二五年五月），土地註冊處的紀錄顯示全港樓宇單位買賣合約的數量接近26萬份，地政總署接收到約50宗無主物業的新個案，可見無主物業只佔整體物業市場一個極小的比例。

就江玉歡議員的提問，經諮詢民政及青年事務局後，現回覆如下：

（一）現時地政總署已接管411個曾由公司持有的無主物業，約三成個案為住宅單位、工廈單位、商鋪和車位，其餘七成為與其他物業業權人共同擁有但不能分割的部分，大多沒有市場價值和未能出售，例如外牆、天台、平台、其他公用部分等。由於無主物業尤其上述三成個案多牽涉業權不清、產權負擔或需先處理單位被佔用等問題，地政總署在收到來自公司註冊處、其他政府部門和法庭等的轉介後，會先小心釐清有關的法律權益並徵詢法律意見，確定物業為無主物業後，便會通知土地註冊處備註物業屬無主財物並歸屬政府，並選擇最適合的處理方式處置有關物業。一般而言，無主物業如適合在市場出售（上述三成個案中的合適個案），地政總署會以招標方式出售有關物業。過去五年（由二○二○年六月至二○二五年五月），地政總署接收到約50宗新個案。地政總署在過去五年亦通過招標程序出售16個無主物業。至於未能出售的物業（上述七成個案），則繼續由地政總署代為管理。

（二）《遺囑認證及遺產管理條例》（第10章）第16條列明了遺產管理官在遺產承辦處的協助下，有權根據法庭授權處理無人申索的遺產的情況。若無人申索的遺產中涉及物業資產，該物業按適當方式處置。就死者遺產中無人申索的餘額，包括出售物業所得的款項，遺產管理官須根據《遺囑認證及遺產管理條例》第23B條刊登廣告，邀請有權申索的人士提出申索。在首次刊登該廣告的日期起計五年屆滿時，遺產管理官如在合理情況下預期不會有人申索有關遺產，則該遺產餘額將會轉撥入政府一般收入。

江玉歡議員關注的物業欺詐問題，目前個案數目仍屬低水平。儘管如此，針對過往一些詐騙個案，土地註冊處會持續與香港警務處保持聯繫與協作，互通涉嫌詐騙交易的資訊，以阻止為涉嫌以欺詐手段而獲得的物業處置註冊。土地註冊處的「物業把關易」服務亦會在出售或抵押物業的文書交付土地註冊處註冊時向已登記的用戶發出電郵通知。

此外，立法會正審議《2025年業權及土地的註冊（雜項修訂）條例草案》，在《土地業權條例》（第585章）下新批土地會先行實施業權註冊制度，並賦權土地註冊處採取措施以減低物業詐騙的風險，而逆權侵佔亦不適用於新批土地。

（三）如上文所述，出現無主物業的情況並不普遍。就曾由公司持有的無主物業，現行的《公司條例》（第622章）已清楚訂明在甚麼情況下政府會接管無主物業，而負責接管的地政總署亦有行之有效的機制妥善處理這些物業。因此，我們認為無須設立跨部門機制。"
立法會七題：打擊電話騙案的措施,2025-06-18 15:30,2025-06-18 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800499.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上邱達根議員的提問和署理商務及經濟發展局局長陳百里博士的書面答覆：

問題：

近年，特區政府採取多元措施，積極打擊電話騙案，包括推出電話智能卡實名登記制（實名登記制）和香港警務處的「防騙視伏App」、要求本地電訊商就新啓動流動電話儲值卡播放提示和攔截可疑來電等，以及與內地和國際執法機構加強合作。然而，有意見指出，本地電話騙案未見減少趨勢，對市民日常生活造成不便和困擾。就此，政府可否告知本會：

答覆：

主席：

通訊事務管理局辦公室（通訊辦）一直從電訊服務的角度制定並實施一系列源頭防範措施，以配合香港警務處加強打擊電話詐騙。就邱達根議員的提問，經諮詢保安局、通訊辦及警方後，現綜合回覆如下：

電話智能卡實名登記制（實名登記制）於二○二三年二月起全面實施，規定所有在本地發出及使用的電話智能卡（包括上台月費服務和電話儲值卡）均須於啓動服務前完成實名登記。在實名登記制下，通訊辦已要求電訊商定期抽查已登記的電話卡資料及加強核查懷疑個案，並將涉嫌違法個案交予警方處理。被抽查的用戶如未能按所屬電訊商指示核實登記資料，有關電話儲值卡會被取消登記而不能繼續使用。截至今年四月底，約471萬張電話儲值卡因客戶未能提供合乎登記要求的資料（包括以身分證明文件副本進行登記及填寫的資料與身分證明文件不一致等）而被拒絕登記，另外有約340萬張未能遵從合規要求的電話儲值卡（包括在電訊商進行抽查時未能按照要求進行身分核實及懷疑使用偽冒證件進行登記等）被取消登記。根據電訊商提供的資料，大部分取消登記的原因是由於相關用戶未按要求提交登記用的身分證明文件作核實。通訊辦並沒有備存相關取消登記原因的分項資料。

為加強實名登記制的有效實施，通訊辦亦已要求電訊商以「智方便」作為香港身份證持有人在實名登記制下的預設登記方式，而非持有香港身份證人士的實名登記資料亦會進行人手核查。現時，在實名登記制下提供虛假資料及／或虛假文件，或會構成刑事罪行。通訊辦並沒有備存已登記電話儲值卡市場轉售的資料。

另外，警方於二○二三年二月推出手機應用程式「防騙視伏App」，協助市民分辨可疑網上平台帳戶、收款帳戶、電話號碼、電郵地址及網址等，並提供防騙提示。截至今年四月底，「防騙視伏App」已錄得逾96萬次下載，搜尋器已錄得840萬次搜尋，向市民作出100萬次預警。現時「防騙視伏App」已經升級至備有自動偵測功能，應用程式內可疑來電警示及可疑網站偵測的功能會自動辨識詐騙來電和詐騙網站，如發現潛在詐騙或網絡安全風險，會即時發出通知，提醒用戶不要接聽或瀏覽。截至今年四月底，「防騙視伏App」已透過自動功能向市民發出逾80萬次可疑來電及網站警示。在通訊辦的協調下，警方及主要電訊商已建立機制，電訊商會根據警方提供的詐騙紀錄盡快攔截涉嫌進行詐騙的電話號碼及可疑網頁連結。截至今年四月底，已有超過50 000個網頁連結及約9 000個本地及非本地電話號碼被攔截。警方亦會積極調查與這些涉嫌詐騙的電話號碼相關的案件。

除了上述措施，通訊辦亦要求電訊商攔截以「+852」為開首的可疑來電、就其他以「+852」開首的境外來電向所有流動用戶發送話音提示或文字訊息、就新啓動流動電話儲值卡播放提示，以及推行「短訊發送人登記制」以協助市民識別短訊發送人的身分。通訊辦亦有持續進行市場巡查及加強公眾宣傳活動，並在今年一月推出防電騙地區大使計劃，委任超過300位區議員及其議員辦事處人員參與出任防電騙地區大使，並自今年五月起聯同防電騙地區大使透過地區活動進一步加強宣傳有關防電騙的訊息。

就電話騙案趨勢方面，警方於今年一至四月期間共接獲1816宗電話騙案，每月平均為454宗，比二○二四年第四季的每月平均（即951宗）大幅下跌52.3%，所涉及損失約3.2億港元，涉及共1759名受害人，年齡介乎15歲至97歲。就去年初開始出現的假冒客服電話騙案，經警方的重點打擊，今年首四個月的月平均數，較去年七月高峰的約1110宗下跌至約190宗，跌幅超過八成。有關騙案趨勢可見政府打擊電話騙案的成效。

政府會繼續多管齊下打擊電話騙案，以保障市民利益。就打擊電話詐騙的措施及實名登記制，政府正參考有關實施的整體經驗，以及警方提供有關犯罪集團使用電話儲值卡的騙案趨勢等資料，檢視有關措施的成效及實名登記制的整體運作，包括審視電話儲值卡數目上限、禁止轉售已實名登記的電話智能卡或利用他人資料牟利進行實名登記的安排等，並計劃於今年諮詢立法會相關事務委員會的意見。"
LCQ7: Measures to combat telephone fraud,2025-06-18 15:30,2025-06-18 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800498.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Duncan Chiu and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Dr Bernard Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

  In recent years, the HKSAR Government has adopted diversified measures to actively combat telephone fraud, including introducing the Real-name Registration Programme for Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) Cards (RNR Programme) and the Hong Kong Police Force's ""Scameter+"" and requiring local telecommunications service providers (TSPs) to play a voice alert message for calls made from newly activated pre-paid SIM (PPS) cards and block suspicious calls, as well as strengthening co-operation with Mainland and international law enforcement agencies. However, there are views pointing out that local telephone fraud cases have not shown a decreasing trend, causing inconvenience and disturbance to the public in their daily lives. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of telephone fraud cases received by the Police from January to May this year, as well as the amount of money involved in such cases, the number of victims and their age distribution;

(2) of the total number of PPS cards which have been rejected as the clients failed to provide information in compliance with the registration requirements since the introduction of the RNR Programme; the total number of the registration records of non-compliant PPS cards which have been cancelled by the TSPs, together with a breakdown and percentage by reason for non-compliance;

(3) whether it has estimated the number of registered PPS cards resold in the market under the RNR Programme; of the authorities' countermeasures currently in place against the resale practice concerned, and how they follow up cases of members of the public purchasing and using PPS cards that have long been registered by other persons;

(4) as the 2024 Policy Address has mentioned that the Government would introduce a legislative amendment proposal into this Council to prohibit the resale of registered SIM cards with a view to further enhancing the RNR Programme, of the latest progress of such work and the legislative timetable;

(5) of the accumulated downloads of ""Scameter+"" since its launch by the Police in February 2023 and the respective numbers of call alerts issued to users and local and non-local suspicious telephone numbers which the TSPs have been required to block; of the details and outcome of the Police's follow-up actions in respect of such suspicious and blocked telephone numbers; and

(6) whether it has comprehensively reviewed the effectiveness of the various measures introduced by the Government to combat telephone fraud; if so, of the results, and the measures in place to cope with the situation where the number of telephone fraud cases has not decreased, including whether it will adjust the existing overall strategy for combating telephone fraud, as well as introduce relevant enhancement measures and new measures?

Reply:

President,

  The Office of the Communications Authority (OFCA) has been devising and implementing a series of preventive measures from the perspective of telecommunications services to assist the Hong Kong Police Force (Police) in combating phone deception at the source. In response to the question raised by the Hon Duncan Chiu, having consulted the Security Bureau, OFCA and the Police, our consolidated reply is as follows:

  The Real-name Registration Programme for SIM Cards (RNR Programme) has been fully implemented since February 2023, requiring that all SIM cards issued and used locally (including SIM service plans and pre-paid SIM cards (PPS cards)) must complete real-name registration before service activation.Under the RNR Programme, OFCA has requested telecommunications service providers (TSPs) to conduct regular sampling checks on registered SIM card information, to step up verification of suspicious cases, and to refer cases suspected of violating the law to the Police for handling. If the users subject to sample checks are unable to verify their registered information in accordance with the instructions of the respective TSPs, the relevant PPS cards will be deregistered and cannot be used thereafter. As at end-April this year, around 4.71 million PPS cards were rejected for registration as the clients failed to provide information in compliance with the registration requirements (including cases where registration was done using a copy of an identity document and the information provided was inconsistent with the identity document, etc). Besides, the registration records of about 3.4million non-compliant PPS cards have been deregistered (including cases where users failed to verify their identities as required during the TSPs' sampling checks and were suspected of using forged documents for registration, etc). According to the information provided by the TSPs, the majority of deregistration was due to users failing to submit required identity documents for verification as required. OFCA does not maintain information on specific reasons for deregistration by breakdown.

  To enhance the effective implementation of the RNR Programme, OFCA has required the TSPs to adopt ""iAM Smart"" as the default registration method for Hong Kong identity card (HKID) holders. For non-HKID holders, their real-name registration information will be manually verified. Currently, provision of false information and/or false documents under the RNR Programme may constitute a criminal offence. OFCA does not maintain information on the resale of registered PPS cards in the market.

  In addition, the Police launched the mobile application ""Scameter+"" in February 2023 to help members of the public distinguish suspicious online platform accounts, payment accounts, phone numbers, email addresses, websites, etc, and to provide the public with anti-fraud tips. As at end-April this year, ""Scameter+"" had recorded over 960000 downloads, 8.4 million searches in its search engine and 1 million alerts issued to members of the public. ""Scameter+"" has now been upgraded and is equipped with automatic detection functions. The Call Alert function and the Website Detection function within the mobile application will automatically identify scam calls and fraudulent websites. If potential fraud or cyber security risk is detected, ""Scameter+"" will issue a real-time notification, reminding users not to answer the call or browse the website. As at end-April this year, ""Scameter+"" had issued over 800000 warnings about suspicious calls and websites to the public through its automatic function. Under OFCA's co-ordination, the Police and major TSPs have established a mechanism where the TSPs will, based on the fraud records provided by the Police, block the telephone numbers suspected to be involved in deception cases and intercept suspicious website links as soon as possible. As at end-April this year, more than 50000 website links and about 9000 local and non-local phone numbers have been successfully blocked. The Police will also actively investigate cases related to these suspected scam phone numbers.

  Apart from the above-mentioned measures, OFCA has also required the TSPs to intercept suspicious calls starting with ""+852"", send voice alerts or text messages to all mobile users for overseas calls prefixed with ""+852"", and play voice alerts for newly activated PPS cards, as well as has launched the SMS Sender Registration Scheme to assist members of public in distinguishing the identity of the SMS senders. OFCA has also been conducting continuous market surveillance and strengthening publicity activities, as well as has launched the District Anti-Phone Deception Ambassador Scheme in January this year, appointing over300District Council members and staff members of their ward offices as District Anti-Phone Deception Ambassadors. Starting from May this year, OFCA has collaborated with District Anti-Phone Deception Ambassadors through community activities to further promote anti-scam messages.

  For telephone deception trends, the Police recorded a total of 1816telephone deception cases between January and April this year, averaging 454 cases per month and representing a significant 52.3 per cent decrease compared to the monthly average of 951 cases in the fourth quarter of 2024. The financial losses associated amounted to approximately HK$320 million, involving a total of 1759victims aged between 15 and 97. For telephone deception cases involving impersonation of customer service emerged since early last year, after focused enforcement efforts by the Police, the monthly average for the first four months this year dropped to approximately 190 cases, recording a decrease of over 80 per cent from the peak of about 1110 cases in July 2024. These trends highlight the effectiveness of measures implemented by the Government in combating phone deception.

  The Government will continue to adopt a multi-pronged approach to combat phone deception and protect the interests of the public. Regarding anti-phone deception measures and the RNR Programme, with reference to the overall implementation experience and the Police's provision of scam trends on criminal groups using PPS cards, the Government is reviewing the implementation effectiveness of relevant measures and overall operation of the RNR Programme, including reviewing the limit on the number of PPS cards, the arrangement for prohibiting the sale of registered SIM cards or using information of others to conduct real-name registration for profit making, etc. The Government aims to consult relevant Legislative Council Panel within this year."

LCQ18: Bona vacantia properties,2025-06-18 15:30,2025-06-18 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800494.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Doreen Kong and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

There are views that along with the demographic changes in Hong Kong, it is expected that the number of bona vacantia properties will continue to increase, which could pose potential challenges to the allocation and management of social resources. It has been reported that in recent years, some gangs have exploited bona vacantia properties to obtain benefits illegally, such as by committing unlawful alienation of the properties, using them for loans or even applying for adverse possession of them, indicating that there are gaps in the regulation of bona vacantia properties. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the specific number of bona vacantia properties currently under the management of the Lands Department (i.e. those properties originally held by a company that has been dissolved under the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32) or the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622)); the details of the Government's disposal of such properties in the past five years (including the progress of disposal);

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the number of bona vacantia properties in Hong Kong which were once held in personal names; whether the Government has currently put in place a relevant mechanism to dispose of such properties; if not, whether it will consider introducing dedicated measures or mechanisms to prevent such bona vacantia properties from being used for unlawful acts; if so, of the details, and whether the Government will impose administrative charges in the process of disposing of such bona vacantia properties and set clear charging standards in this regard; and

(3) as there are views that the management of bona vacantia properties (including those bona vacantia properties which were once held by private individuals or companies) involves the powers and responsibilities of a number of government departments, whether the Government has put in place a cross-departmental co-ordination mechanism to enhance the efficiency of such work; if not, whether it has plans to further strengthen the cross-departmental collaboration on such work?

Reply:

President,

Bona vacantia properties (BVPs) generally refer to some real properties originally owned by individuals or companies, but the individual owners of properties subsequently dies and no one claims the estate, or the companies were liquidated and dissolved. In accordance with the prevailing laws, real properties owned by individuals or companies are handled by different ordinances to ensure that the rights and interests of the legal owners or successors of the properties will not be infringed and that the properties are properly handled when they become BVPs.

Regarding the properties owned by individuals, the Probate and Administration Ordinance (Cap. 10) provides the jurisdiction of the court to handle matters relating to probate and administration of deceased's estates, including the handling of unclaimed estates of a deceased person. If unclaimed estates involve property assets, the property will be disposed of in an appropriate manner, including sale.

For properties owned by companies, in the course of winding up and dissolution, liquidators will sell properties owned by the companies to pay off outstanding liabilities. If a company, pursuant to the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) or the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32), completes the procedures for winding up and is about to dissolve, every property and right (such as including some properties that are yet to be sold in the market) vested in or held on trust for the company immediately before the dissolution is vested in the Government as bona vacantia. If such bona vacantia property is a land property, it will be managed by the Lands Department on behalf of the Government.

In the past five years (from June 2020 to May 2025), records from the Land Registry show that the number of sales and purchase agreements for building units in Hong Kong was close to 260 000, while the Lands Department received about 50 new cases of BVPs. It can be seen that BVPs only account a very small portion of the overall property market.

In response to the question raised by the Hon Doreen Kong, our reply in consultation with the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau is as follows:

(1) As of now, the Lands Department has taken over 411 BVPs previously owned by companies, of which about 30 per cent cases are residential units, industrial units, shops and parking spaces. The remaining 70 per cent are the parts jointly owned with other property owners but inseparable, most of which have no market value and cannot be sold, such as external walls, rooftops, platforms, other common parts. As BVPs, especially the abovementioned 30 per cent cases, often involve unclear ownership, encumbrances or the need to first handle problems such as occupation of units, the Lands Department will carefully clarify the relevant legal rights and seek legal advice after receiving referrals from the Companies Registry, other government departments and the Court, etc. After confirming that the property is a BVP, the Lands Department will notify the Land Registry to add a remark that the property has been vested in the Government as bona vacantia, and choose the most appropriate means to dispose of the property. Generally speaking, if the BVPs are suitable for sale in the market (the appropriate cases among the abovementioned 30 per cent cases), the Lands Department will sell the property by tender. In the past five years (from June 2020 to May 2025), the Lands Department received about 50 new cases of BVPs. The Lands Department also sold 16 BVPs through tendering process in the past five years. As for the properties that cannot be sold (i.e. the abovementioned 70 per cent cases), these will continue to be managed by the Lands Department on behalf.

(2) Section 16 of the Probate and Administration Ordinance (Cap. 10) stipulates the cases in which the Official Administrator, assisted by the Probate Registry, is entitled to administer the unclaimed estate of a deceased person as granted by the Court. If the unclaimed estate concerned involves property asset, the property will be disposed of as appropriate. For any unclaimed balance of deceased's estate, including the money received from the sale of properties, the Official Administrator shall cause an advertisement to invite any claims to be made in accordance with section 23B of the Ordinance. If at the expiration of a period of five years from the date of first publication of such advertisement, the Official Administrator is of the opinion that no claim can reasonably be expected against the estate, the balance of the estate will be transferred to the general revenue of the Government.

Regarding the property fraud issue that the Hon Doreen Kong is concerned about, the current number of cases is still at a low level. Nevertheless, in response to some past fraud cases, the Land Registry will continue to maintain contact and collaboration with the Hong Kong Police Force to exchange information on suspected fraudulent transactions to prevent registrations for properties suspected to have been acquired through fraudulent means. The Property Alert service of the Land Registry will also send email notifications to registered users when the instruments for the sale or mortgage of properties are delivered to the Land Registry for registration.

Besides, the Legislative Council is scrutinising the Registration of Titles and Land (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2025. Under the Land Titles Ordinance (Cap. 585), the title registration system will be implemented on newly granted land first and the Land Registry will be empowered to take measures to reduce the risk of property fraud. Adverse possession will also not be applicable to newly granted land.

(3) As mentioned above, it is not common for BVPs to arise. For BVPs previously owned by companies, the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) currently in force has clearly stipulated the circumstances under which the Government will take over BVPs, and the Lands Department, which is responsible for taking over BVPs, also has a well-established mechanism to properly handle these properties. Therefore, we believe that there is no need to set up an inter-departmental mechanism."
Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-06-18 15:30,2025-06-18 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800544.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on June 17 to noon today (June 18), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 232 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit.

立法會十七題：鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位,2025-06-18 15:00,2025-06-18 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061700686.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上李惟宏議員的提問和署理財經事務及庫務局局長陳浩濂的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，香港應不斷鞏固及增強國際金融中心的建設，進一步對接國家發展戰略，擴大各項互聯互通機制，提升香港在國家發展大局中的功能，以吸引更多內地及國際資本落戶香港。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有業界人士反映，現時「粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通」（跨境理財通）下的「南向通」產品不能由香港金融機構直接到內地作宣傳推廣，而「北向通」產品亦不能由內地金融機構直接到香港作宣傳推廣，當局會否與內地監管機構商討，在跨境銷售和宣傳上作出優化措施，以讓兩地從業員可全面開展業務；

（二）鑑於據悉，現時與內地金融專業資格互認安排下，持有香港證券及期貨事務監察委員會相關牌照的香港從業員仍需通過內地相關的法規考試，才可在內地執業，當局會否與內地監管機構進一步磋商，研究簡化或豁免相關法規考試，以促進香港從業員到內地發展業務；

（三）鑑於有業界人士反映，當局能否擴大跨境理財通的投資產品範圍，包括增加低和中風險以外的投資選項，包括但不限於另類投資或私募基金等，以滿足境內外投資者的多元風險管理需求；及

（四）鑑於本年度《財政預算案》提及，政府積極優化與內地互聯互通機制，包括計劃在港推出離岸國債期貨，以及盡快落實並引入股票大宗交易等，當局在未來研究擴容增量方案時，有哪些措施進一步提升市場流動性和促進市場交易？

答覆：

主席：

香港一直積極發揮「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，主動對接「十四五」規劃、「一帶一路」倡議、粵港澳大灣區建設等國家戰略，推動與內地金融市場高度融合發展，充分把握國家發展帶來的機遇。就問題的各個部分，經諮詢香港金融管理局（金管局）和證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）後，現回覆如下：

（一）及（三）「粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通」（跨境理財通）為粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）居民提供一條正式、直接和便捷的渠道，跨境投資不同類型的理財產品，是大灣區金融發展的一項里程碑。

跨境理財通自二○二一年九月啓動至今持續穩步發展，「理財通2.0」已於二○二四年二月正式啓動，優化措施包括把個人投資者額度由人民幣100萬元提高至人民幣300萬元；降低南向通的參與門檻，支持更多大灣區居民參與試點；擴大參與機構範圍，新增符合要求的證券公司作為參與主體；擴大合格投資產品範圍；以及進一步優化宣傳銷售安排。

在銷售推廣方面，以銀行為例，去年在南向通的框架下推出了優化的宣傳及銷售安排，香港銀行在取得南向通客戶書面同意後，可在該銷售推廣過程中主動向他們介紹符合其風險胃納的產品及相關資料，為銷售機構簡化流程之餘，同時讓南向通投資者更便捷地獲取所需的產品信息和專業指導建議。

我們也剛在二○二五年六月和內地相關金融監督管理機構共同落實「三方線上會議」銷售安排。在該安排下，應南向通客戶要求，內地銀行可以協助南向通客戶在其內地分行的營業網點，與香港銀行就南向通服務建立三方線上對話或視像會議，而香港銀行代表可在該對話或會議中，向該南向通客戶介紹南向通合資格理財產品。該安排為南向通投資者提供了一個便利的線上途徑瞭解相關的香港理財產品，相信有助本地銀行提升銷售和溝通的便利度。

此外，我們也致力在「理財通2.0」的政策框架下進一步完善投資產品範圍。例如在基金方面，自「理財通2.0」推出以來，南向投資合資格的公募基金由二○二三年底約160隻增加至二○二五年三月底的358隻，強化了產品的選項。我們會在符合風險可控和適切保障投資者的原則下，持續檢視「理財通2.0」的運行情況，並與內地相關監管機構探索進一步優化擴容的可行性。

跨境理財通作為大灣區金融合作創新措施，涉及三地不同的監管體系，採取先行先試、循序漸進的方式進行試點。「理財通2.0」實施以來運作暢順，投資者人數及跨境匯劃金額錄得顯著增長。根據中國人民銀行統計，截至二○二五年四月底，參與跨境理財通的大灣區個人投資者超過154 200人，跨境匯劃金額（包括粵港澳）超過人民幣1,122億元。政府和金融監管機構將繼續留意市場發展及跨境理財通運作情況，並與內地監管機構和業界保持交流，探索進一步完善和改進的空間。

（二）有關與內地金融專業資格互認方面，證監會已與中國證券監督管理委員會就證券及期貨業落實資格互認安排，並簡化在內地辦理證券執業登記和申請期貨或基金執業資格的相關程序。持有證監會相關牌照的香港專業人員只需通過內地相關法律法規考試，而無需通過基礎科目的考試。

銀行業方面，香港銀行學會與中國銀行業協會於二○○九年簽訂《中國銀行業協會與香港銀行學會資格互認合作協議》，正式啓動資格互認機制。其後，雙方兩度簽訂補充協議以完善有關安排。中國銀行業協會、東方銀行業高級管理人員研修院與香港銀行學會於二○二二年再簽訂補充協議三，以確保合資格者可取得香港銀行學會所頒發的「財富管理師」專業資歷。在該合作協議下，內地和香港的金融從業人員可通過該資格互認機制取得「雙資格」（「個人理財專業證書（初級）」及「財富管理師」）。

我們會繼續和內地監管機構研究優化措施，探索增加香港專業人員進入內地市場從業的渠道，為內地與香港市場提供更富彈性的人才資源。

（四）政府聯同金融監管機構正與內地相關機構積極推進將人民幣櫃台納入港股通，引入股票大宗交易及將房地產投資信託基金納入互聯互通機制，以吸引和便利更多資金參與香港證券市場，提升市場流動性。我們會繼續與內地商討金融市場互聯互通進一步擴容增量方案和優化安排，更好滿足境內外投資者跨市場、多元化配置資產的需求，支持內地和香港資本市場融合健康發展。"

LCQ17: Consolidating Hong Kong's status as international financial centre,2025-06-18 15:00,2025-06-18 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061700689.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Robert Lee and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

 There are views that Hong Kong should continue to consolidate and enhance the development of an international financial centre, further dovetail with the national development strategies, expand various mutual access mechanisms, and enhance Hong Kong's functions in the overall development of the country, so as to attract more Mainland and international capital to Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as some members of the industry have relayed that at present, under the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (WMC) in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, products under the Southbound Scheme cannot be directly promoted in the Mainland by Hong Kong financial institutions, and products under the Northbound Scheme cannot be directly promoted in Hong Kong by Mainland financial institutions, whether the authorities will discuss with Mainland regulators enhancement measures on cross-boundary sales and promotion, so as to enable practitioners in both places to fully launch their businesses;

(2) as it is learnt that under the existing arrangements for mutual recognition of professional qualifications with the Mainland, Hong Kong practitioners holding the relevant licences of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission are still required to pass the examination on relevant Mainland laws and regulations before they are allowed to practise in the Mainland, whether the authorities will further discuss with the Mainland regulators to explore the streamlining or exemption of the examination on relevant laws and regulations, so as to facilitate Hong Kong practitioners to develop their business in the Mainland;

(3) given the views relayed by some members of the industry, whether the authorities can expand the scope of investment products under the WMC Scheme, including providing additional investment options other than those with low or medium risk, including but not limited to alternative investments or private equity funds, so as to meet the diversified risk management needs of both Mainland and overseas investors; and

(4) as it has been mentioned in this year's Budget that the Government will actively enhance the mutual market access mechanism with the Mainland, including the plan for the issuance of offshore Mainland government bond futures in Hong Kong, and implementing block trading of stocks as soon as possible, what measures the authorities have in place to further improve market liquidity and facilitate market transactions when exploring further expansion initiatives in the future?

Reply:

President,

 Hong Kong has been actively leveraging our unique advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, with the support of our motherland and our connectivity to the world. We have proactively aligned with national strategies such as the 14th Five-Year Plan, the Belt and Road Initiative, and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, with an aim to promoting deeper integration with the Mainland financial markets and to fully capitalising on the opportunities brought by our country's development. In consultation with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), my reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) and (3) Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (WMC) in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) provides GBA residents with a formal, direct and convenient channel for cross-boundary investment in diverse wealth management products and marks a milestone in the financial development of the GBA.

 WMC has seen continuous and steady development since its launch in September 2021. ""WMC 2.0"" commenced in February 2024. Enhancement measures include increasing the individual investor quota from RMB1 million to RMB3 million, lowering the threshold for participating in the Southbound Scheme to support more GBA residents to participate in the scheme, expanding the scope of participating institutions to include eligible securities firms, expanding the scope of eligible investment products, and further enhancing the promotion and sales arrangements.

 In terms of sales and promotion, taking banks as an example, enhanced promotion and sales arrangements were introduced last year under the Southbound Scheme. After obtaining written consent from a Southbound Scheme client, the Hong Kong bank concerned could proactively introduce products and relevant information that align with the client's risk appetite during that sales promotion process. This not only simplifies the sales process of the relevant institutions but also allows Southbound Scheme investors to more conveniently access the needed product information and professional guidance.

 In June 2025, we also jointly implemented with relevant Mainland financial regulatory authorities a ""Tri-party Online Meeting"" sales arrangement. Under this arrangement, at the request of a Southbound Scheme client, a Mainland bank may assist him/her at its Mainland branch to set up a tri-party online dialogue or video conference with a Hong Kong bank in relation to the Southbound Scheme services. During such meeting, representative(s) from the Hong Kong bank can introduce eligible wealth management products under the Southbound Scheme to the Southbound Scheme client. This arrangement provides Southbound Scheme investors with a convenient online channel to learn about relevant Hong Kong wealth management products and is also expected to enhance the convenience of sales and communication for local banks.

 Furthermore, we are committed to further enhancing the range of investment products under the ""WMC 2.0"" policy framework. For example, in the area of funds, since the launch of ""WMC 2.0"", the number of eligible public funds under the Southbound Scheme has increased from around 160 in end-2023 to 358 by the end of March 2025, thereby strengthening the range of products available. We will continue to review the operation of ""WMC 2.0"" under the principles of controllable risk and adequate investor protection, and work with relevant Mainland regulatory authorities to explore the feasibility of further optimisation and expansion of WMC.

 As an innovative financial co-operation measure in the GBA involving three different regulatory systems, WMC has been implemented under a pilot approach in a gradual and incremental manner. Since the implementation of ""WMC 2.0"", operations have been smooth, with a significant increase in the number of investors and amount of cross-boundary fund remittances. According to statistics from the People's Bank of China, up to end-April 2025, over 154 200 individual investors in the GBA participated in WMC, with cross-boundary fund remittances (including Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao) amounting to over RMB112.2 billion had been recorded. The Government and the financial regulators will continue to monitor market developments and the operation of WMC, collaborate with the Mainland regulatory authorities and the industry to explore room for further enhancement.

(2) Regarding mutual recognition of financial professional qualifications with the Mainland, the SFC and the China Securities Regulatory Commission have implemented an arrangement for mutual recognition of professional qualifications for the securities and futures sector, and simplified the relevant procedures for obtaining securities practising registration and applying for the futures or fund practising qualifications in the Mainland. Hong Kong professionals with relevant licence issued by the SFC only need to pass the Mainland's examination on the relevant laws and regulations; and the examination on the foundation paper is not required.

 For the banking sector, the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers (HKIB) and the China Banking Association (CBA) signed the Memorandum of Understanding on Mutual Recognition of Personal Wealth Management Qualification Certificates in 2009, officially launching the mutual recognition mechanism. Subsequently, the two sides signed addendums twice to improve the relevant arrangements. The CBA, the China Bankers Institute and the HKIB signed Addendum III in 2022 to ensure eligible practitioners can obtain the Associate Retail Wealth Professional (ARWP) professional qualification issued by the HKIB. Under the Agreement, financial practitioners from the Mainland and Hong Kong can obtain ""dual qualifications"" (Level 1 of Qualification Certificate of Banking Professional and ARWP) through the mutual recognition mechanism.

 We will continue to examine enhancement measures with Mainland regulatory authorities to explore ways of broadening Hong Kong professionals' entry into the Mainland market, thereby increasing the flexibility in the provision of human capital for the Mainland and Hong Kong markets.

(4) The Government, together with financial regulatory authorities, is actively working with relevant Mainland authorities to advance the inclusion of the Renminbi counters under the Southbound Trading of Stock Connect, introduction of block trading, and the expansion of mutual-market access regime to cover Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), with a view to attracting and facilitating greater participation in Hong Kong's securities market and enhancing market liquidity. We will continue discussions with Mainland counterparts on further expansion and optimisation of the financial market connectivity schemes. This will better meet the needs of domestic and overseas investors for cross-market and diversified asset allocation, supporting the healthy integration and development of the Mainland and Hong Kong capital markets."
立法會十五題︰為非本地學生提供支援,2025-06-18 14:58,2025-06-18 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800344.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上梁毓偉議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的書面答覆：

問題：

近年，香港全力打造「留學香港」品牌，以發展成為國際專上教育樞紐，並逐步優化非本地學生在香港留學期間的支援措施。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年透過不同途徑申請在香港修讀全日制經本地評審課程而獲得學士學位或更高資歷的非本地學生人數、最終獲取錄的非本地學生人數，以及非本地學生佔相關課程學額的百分比分別為何；

（二）鑑於過往全日制非本地本科生和研究生需在獲得入境事務處發出「不反對通知書」後才可在港從事兼職工作，過去三年，每年有多少名非本地學生在獲發該通知書後從事兼職工作，當中修讀學士和碩士課程的人數分別為何；

（三）自政府於二○二三年十一月及去年十一月分別暫免在港就讀全日制非本地研究生及本科生參與兼職工作限制（暫免安排）後，當局有否統計有多少名非本地學生在暫免安排下從事兼職工作；如沒有統計，當局未來會否收集有關數據及檢討該措施的成效；長遠而言，會否考慮將暫免安排恆常化；

（四）鑑於有非本地學生向本人反映，有本地僱主因不清楚暫免安排而對聘用非本地學生從事兼職工作卻步，當局如何宣傳推廣暫免安排，以及有否與相關大專院校合作，將相關就業資訊及支援服務提供予非本地學生；及

（五）鑑於據報，行政長官於日前表示香港全面歡迎受美國政策影響而受不公平對待的學生赴港留學，並將全力和本地大學提供最佳的支援和協助，當局至今支援該等學生的工作進展為何；有否與各本地大學成立專責小組，向該等學生提供一站式轉學服務，例如加快錄取、學分轉換，以至提供住宿安排等緊急支援措施，以爭取更多優秀學生來港？

答覆：

主席：

香港擁有良好的教育基建，整體教育競爭力位列全球前五名。其中，香港專上教育高度國際化和多元化，擁有五所世界百強大學，優秀的科研人才，是國際高端人才交流合作的匯聚地。為充分發揮「一國兩制」下香港專上教育的獨特優勢，全力推進香港成為國際專上教育樞紐，打造「留學香港」品牌，吸引更多境外學生來港就讀及進行研究。

就梁毓偉議員的提問，經諮詢勞工及福利局綜合回覆如下：

（一）二○二二／二三至二○二四／二五學年，在香港修讀經本地評審學士學位或以上程度課程的非本地學生人數，以及非本地學生佔相關學士學位課程學額的百分比表列如下：

（二）、（三）及（四）政府自二○二三年十一月起暫免在港就讀的全日制非本地研究生從事兼職工作的限制，並於二○二四年十一月起將暫免安排擴展至全日制非本地本科生。自二○二三年十一月至今，入境事務處（入境處）已向近15萬名合資格的非本地學生發出「不反對通知書」，這些學生在暫免安排下毋須另行申請便可從事兼職工作，工作時數及地點不受限制。入境處就上述安排發出的「不反對通知書」按學生類別的分項統計數字表列如下：

＃政府自二○二四年十一月一日起暫免全日制非本地本科生從事兼職工作的限制。

受惠於上述安排的非本地生在畢業後均合資格經「非本地畢業生留港／回港就業安排」申請留港發展。容許他們在就學期間兼職工作，可便利他們累積在港工作的親身體驗和認識，提升他們畢業後留港發展的意欲，並有助吸納更多外地學生來港就讀。

非本地生在暫免安排下毋須就兼職工作向入境處提出申請或知會所屬院校。因此，政府沒有從事兼職工作的非本地生的統計數字。據院校反映，不少非本地生利用安排從事各類兼職工作，包括商業支援、零售、市場推廣等。院校普遍認同措施有助吸引非本地生畢業後留港發展，從而擴大香港的潛在人才庫。

政府經由新聞公報、入境處網站、僱主通訊等渠道宣傳這項暫免安排，亦藉商會會面、人力資源經理會聯合會議等不同場合，向商會、僱主及人力資源從業員介紹及推廣。政府亦鼓勵相關院校協助加強校內宣傳以及為合資格學生提供相應支援。政府會於今年檢視整項暫免安排。

（五）因應目前全球教育格局變化，教育局已即時呼籲全港所有大學，為受影響的學生學者提供便利措施，維護他們的正當合法權益，並按各院校多元招生及人才政策，吸引頂尖人才。教育局樂見本港各大學均積極回應及密切留意情況，充分善用政府支持本地專上院校擴容提質的便利措施。

教育局會繼續密切留意事態發展，並因應他們的需要通盤考慮支援方案，發揮香港作為國際專上教育樞紐的角色。除院校的招聘措施外，政府亦通過一系列措施，包括提升政府資助的專上院校非本地學生限額一倍至40%、增加獎學金名額、並逐步增加香港博士研究生獎學金計劃名額，吸引更多傑出人才來港就學。我們會繼續推展各項政策措施，並在國家、地區和國際層面推動聯繫網絡和夥伴關係，亦會繼續與各持份者合作，加強推廣及宣傳「留學香港」品牌，致力配合國家科教興國、優質人才、創新發展的戰略，為國家的需要貢獻我們的力量。"
LCQ15: Providing support for non-local students,2025-06-18 14:58,2025-06-18 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800346.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

 In recent years, Hong Kong has spared no effort in building the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand to develop Hong Kong into an international hub for post-secondary education, and has been gradually enhancing support measures for non-local students while they are studying in Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of non-local students applying through different ways for studying full-time locally-accredited programmes in Hong Kong who have obtained bachelor's degrees or higher qualifications and those who have eventually been admitted, as well as the percentages of non-local students in the number of places of the relevant programmes, in each of the past three years;

(2) given that full-time non-local undergraduate and postgraduate students were required to obtain a ""No Objection Letter"" (NOL(s)) issued by the Immigration Department before they were allowed to take up part-time jobs in Hong Kong in the past, of the number of non-local students who took up part-time jobs after obtaining NOLs in each of the past three years and, among them, the respective numbers of those who were pursuing undergraduate and postgraduate studies;

(3) given that the Government temporarily exempted full-time non-local postgraduate and undergraduate students from the restrictions on taking up part-time jobs in November 2023 and November last year respectively (the temporary exemption arrangements), whether the authorities have compiled statistics afterwards on the number of non-local students who have taken up part-time jobs under the temporary exemption arrangements; if they have not compiled the statistics, whether they will collect the relevant data and review the effectiveness of such measure in future; whether they will consider regularising the temporary exemption arrangements in the long run;

(4) as some non-local students have relayed to me that some local employers are deterred from employing non-local students to take up part-time jobs because they are not clear about the temporary exemption arrangements, how the authorities will publicise and promote the temporary exemption arrangements, and whether they have co-operated with the relevant tertiary institutions to provide non-local students with the relevant employment information and support services; and

(5) as it has been reported that the Chief Executive has indicated earlier that Hong Kong fully welcomes students who suffer from unfair treatment as a result of the policies of the United States to study in Hong Kong, and that he will do his best to provide the most appropriate support and assistance to students in collaboration with the local universities, of the work progress made by the authorities in supporting such students so far; whether they have set up task forces with various local universities to provide one-stop transfer services for such students, e.g. expediting their admission, transfer of credits, as well as urgent support measures such as providing accommodation arrangements, so as to attract more outstanding students to Hong Kong?

Reply:

President,

 Hong Kong has sound education infrastructure and our overall competitiveness in education ranked top five in the world. Among others, Hong Kong's post-secondary education is highly internationalised and diversified, and we boast five of the world's top 100 universities with outstanding talent in technology and research, making Hong Kong an international hub for exchange and collaboration among high-calibre talent. To fully leverage the distinctive advantages of the post-secondary education sector in Hong Kong under ""one country, two systems"", and to develop Hong Kong into an international post-secondary education hub, we strive to build the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand and attract more non-local students to study and conduct research in Hong Kong.

 After consultation with the Labour and Welfare Bureau, our consolidated replies to Hon Kenneth Leung's questions are as follows:

(1) In the 2022/23 to 2024/25 Academic Year (AY), the numbers of non-local students pursuing locally-accredited programmes at undergraduate level or above in Hong Kong, and the number of non-local students as a percentage of relevant undergraduate student places are tabulated below:

(Note 2) Non-UGC-funded programmes cover publicly-funded programmes offered by the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts (HKAPA) and self-financing programmes offered by UGC-funded universities, the HKAPA, and other institutions. Relevant figures refer to the headcounts of full-time and part-time programmes.
(Note 3) Referring to non-local student enrolment as a percentage of local student places in UGC-funded undergraduate programmes.
(Note 4) The percentages of non-local students of non-UGC-funded undergraduate programmes refer to the percentages of intakes of non-local students as a share of the estimated intake places of relevant programmes. Estimated intake places are based on estimates made by institutions for planning purposes and may not necessarily represent the maximum approved intake quotas or admission targets.

 In the 2022/23 to 2024/25 AY, the number of applications from non-local students for UGC-funded first-year-first-degree undergraduate programmes ranged between 70000 and 80000. The Education Bureau (EDB) does not maintain information on the number of applicants of other taught programmes.

(2), (3) and (4) The Government has temporarily exempted full-time non-local postgraduate students of local programmes from the restriction on taking up part-time jobs since November 2023, and has extended the temporary exemption arrangement to full-time non-local undergraduate students from November 2024 onwards. Since November 2023, the Immigration Department (ImmD) has issued ""No Objection Letters"" to nearly 150 000 eligible non-local students, who are allowed to take up part-time jobs under the temporary exemption arrangement without making applications. There is no restriction on the number of hours or the location of the part-time employment. The breakdown of the numbers of ""No Objection Letters"" issued by the ImmD under this arrangement by student category are tabulated below:

# The Government has temporarily exempted full-time non-local undergraduate students from the restriction on taking up part-time jobs since November 1, 2024.

 Non-local students benefitting from this arrangement are eligible to apply to stay in Hong Kong after graduation for development through the ""Immigration Arrangement for Non-local Graduates"". Allowing them to take up part-time jobs during their studies enables them to gain personal exposure and knowledge for working in Hong Kong, enhances their incentives to stay in Hong Kong for development after graduation, and helps attract more outside students to study in Hong Kong.

 Under the temporary exemption arrangement, non-local students are not required to apply to the ImmD or notify their institutions for part-time employment. Therefore, the Government does not maintain statistics of non-local students taking up part-time jobs. According to the institutions, many non-local students have made use of the arrangement to take up various types of part-time jobs, including business support, retailing, and marketing, etc. The institutions generally agree that this arrangement helps attract non-local students to stay in Hong Kong for development after graduation, thereby expanding the city's potential talent pool.

 The Government promotes this temporary exemption arrangement through various channels such as press releases, the ImmD's website and communications with employers, etc, and introduces the arrangement to chambers of commerce, employers and human resources practitioners through meetings with chambers of commerce, joint meetings of Human Resources Managers' Clubs, and other occasions. The Government also encourages relevant institutions to assist in enhancing on-campus promotion and providing appropriate support to eligible students. The Government will review the entire temporary exemption arrangement this year.

(5) In the light of the changes in the global higher education landscape, the EDB has promptly called on all universities in Hong Kong to introduce facilitation measures for affected students and scholars with a view to safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests, while attracting top talent in accordance with their diversified admissions and talent policies. The EDB is pleased to see that local universities are responding proactively and closely monitoring the situation, fully utilising the Government's facilitation initiatives that support the capacity expansion and quality enhancement of post-secondary institutions in Hong Kong.

 The EDB will continue to keep a close eye on the development and accordingly consider support measures for them in a holistic approach so as to give full play to Hong Kong's role as an international post-secondary education hub. Apart from the recruitment measures of the institutions, the Government attracts more top talent to pursue their studies in Hong Kong through a range of initiatives, including doubling the cap on non-local students in publicly funded post-secondary institutions to 40 per cent, increasing scholarship quotas, and gradually increasing the number of places under the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme. We remain committed to pursuing various policies and initiatives, fostering networks and partnerships at the national, regional, and international levels, and will continue to work collaboratively with stakeholders to promote the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand. These efforts align with the national strategies to invigorate the country through science and education, cultivate high-calibre talent, and advance innovation and development, thereby contributing to meeting the needs of our nation."
立法會五題：監察水管情況的措施,2025-06-18 14:57,2025-06-18 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800511.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上容海恩議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的答覆：

問題：

早前皇后山邨及山麗苑的食水水質事故，以及屯門區的水管爆裂事故，引起社會對水管情況的關注。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）就皇后山邨及山麗苑水質事故所成立的工作小組的人手編制及工作詳情為何，包括預計清洗水缸及檢驗水質的次數及所涉開支；該小組會否調查事故有否涉及人為疏忽；該兩個屋苑辦事處至今共收到多少宗居民就水質問題的查詢或求助；

（二）鑑於水務署表示，會更換全港仍有瀝青塗層的喉管，目前有關喉管在全港各區的分布、涉及屋苑名稱，以及有關更換喉管工作的時間表為何；有否計劃檢查全港屋苑的食水供應系統，以確認其不會積聚瀝青樹脂或其他雜質；如有，詳情（包括時間表、涉及人手和開支）為何；如否，原因為何，以及有何措施預防同類事故；及

（三）有否計劃加強應用科技及人工智能，以就水管及水質狀況進行24小時持續監測及分析，務求及早發現水管異樣並進行維修；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆

主席︰

就容海恩議員的提問，我答覆如下：

（一）政府高度關注皇后山邨及山麗苑食水出現瀝青沉積物的事件，在五月底收到食水出現黑點後，水務署及房屋署即時成立工作小組為事故進行聯合調查，並制定解決措施。工作小組由水務署署長及房屋署副署長（屋邨管理）聯合領導，小組成員為負責當區供水設施運作及屋邨管理共11位現職工程和物業管理專業人員等。水務署已就其負責管理和保養的水管進行了11次清洗，而房屋署則就其負責管理的水管及水缸分別進行了六次及三次清洗；房屋署亦已在屋苑及每座樓宇的入水位安裝22個過濾設施；水務署持續在屋邨抽水樣本作化驗，所有樣本至今均符合香港食水標準。

自六月七日設立及宣傳24小時熱線，政府共接獲約700宗查詢。此外，水務署從當區區議員、地區三會及關愛隊所設的街站及家訪等不同渠道收到超過1 500宗要求沖洗水錶個案，全部都在一至兩天內完成沖洗水錶工作。現時大部份居民表示水質已有改善，無須繼續跟進。

水務署相信食水中的黑色沉積物是源自供水系統上游位於坪輋路一段400米長的鋼水管，該段水管採用瀝青作為內壁保護塗層，而沉積物應是在二○二二年底水務署喉管安裝濾網之前，已被沖入屋邨內部喉管的殘留物。我們已成立由食水安全諮詢委員會主席及兩位成員組成的專家小組，協助溯源工作，專家小組認為上述的評估合理。水務署短期內會將今次事故的調查報告送交食水安全諮詢委員會檢視。

汲取是次經驗，我們認為應可在解說過程及處理速度上作出改善。現時，我們正全力進行各項工作，當中涉及的開支屬各有關部門服務開支的一部分，暫時難以分拆。

（二）與香港同樣，一些先進城市的供水系統現時仍存在以瀝青保護喉管，在長年使用後，物料有可能會剝落。在二○○五年後，水務署的供水喉管已沒有採用瀝青塗層。目前，對於那些仍然有該類塗層的水管，我們作出了更深入的分類，當中只有約230公里長屬食水分配水管，佔全港食水分配水管網絡約3.9%，其分布我已於回覆附表載列。

雖然供水設施所採用的瀝青塗層是惰性物質，不會溶於水，但我們明白如在供水中有剝落的微粒，亦會構成市民的不安。為了應對這情況，水務署現時已在有關供水網絡安裝了約1 000個濾網，當中已考慮喉管塗層的剝落量、投訴個案、涉及供水人口等因素。這些濾網有效阻隔剝落物料進入樓宇內部供水系統。水務署正檢視是否需要在合適位置額外加裝濾網；亦會優化工作指引，向物業管理公司建議保養供水管道及濾網的方法。

為盡快停用與皇后山事件有關的坪輋路瀝青塗層喉管，水務署過去一星期以破格思維，探討使用外露臨時喉管的方式，聯同發展局、承建商與運輸署、警務處及北區民政處進行跨部門協作，制定交通安排。即使相關位置交通繁忙、工地狹窄，經各方努力後，水務署將立即啓動工程，並日以繼夜施工，預計在七月初完成臨時喉管。換言之，由七月初起這段瀝青塗層鋼管將會永久停用。水務署亦爭取於今年年底前以藏於地底的永久喉管替代該段外露的臨時喉管。

去年，水務署獲立法會撥款，更換或修復約20公里長（註）含瀝青內壁塗層的鋼喉管。因應今次事故及喉管老化爆裂的情況，水務署將提交更換喉管的短、中期計劃供發展局檢視。我們計劃在下個月的發展事務委員會和大家交代。

（三）水務署會擴大「智管網」監測範圍至食水主幹水管及所有食水分配管網，並更新監測水管流量及水壓的傳感器，務求加快識別及處理潛在爆裂風險的水管，整項工作預計於二○二七年完成。我們已要求水務署探討提前完成的可能性。

水務署將會與香港理工大學合作，在今年八月成立「管道機械人」聯合實驗室，為水管進行高精確度的檢測。

至於監測水質狀況，水務署在一些重要水塘及濾水廠安裝了24小時在線水質監測系統。另外，每年以隨機方法在全港約28 000多個水龍頭用戶端抽取水樣本作測試，樣本採集比率、測試方法及食水參數均按照國際標準。署方亦已於二○二三年開始研究於未來數年在供水管網建設更多水質監測點，提升預警能力，研究預計於本年內完成。

多謝主席。

（三）面對中美博弈局勢，政府會否推出具體政策措施，推動本港高等院校把握地緣政治變局中的新機遇，以進一步強化香港作為國際教育樞紐的地位；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

香港整體教育競爭力在全球排名前五，專上教育高度國際化和多元化，至今五所大學教育資助委員會（教資會）資助大學打入全球百強，六所資助大學位列亞洲五十強，多所大學在全球最國際化大學排名中名列前茅，並擁有優秀的研究人才，對全球學生學者深具吸引力。在政務司司長督導的教育、科技和人才委員會的帶領下，政府會繼續推動國際高端人才集聚香港，統籌推進教育、科技和人才一體化融合發展，擴大銜接連貫，制訂政策推動育才、匯才、科技協同發展，以鞏固香港作為國際專上教育樞紐及國際創新科技中心的地位。

LCQ19: Facilitating admission of high-calibre overseas students and scholars to Hong Kong,2025-06-18 14:45,2025-06-18 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800381.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Tang Fei and a written reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

 It has been reported that the United States (US) Government has recently barred Harvard University from enrolling international students. There are views that, due to political factors, it is expected that more top-tier institutions will face restrictions on international student recruitment in the future. This could lead to significant shifts in the global talent mobility within the higher education sector. As such, Hong Kong, as an international education hub, should seize the opportunity to actively attract and retain high-calibre international students and scholars, so as to consolidate its position as a regional hub for knowledge, innovation and technology. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether, in the face of the aforesaid abrupt change in overseas higher education policies, the Government has formulated a systematic plan to assist Hong Kong institutions in attracting high-calibre students affected by the turbulent international situation to pursue studies in Hong Kong, and to ensure that they can stay in Hong Kong for career development after graduation; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) how the University Grants Committee (UGC) will avoid resource misallocation and vicious competition in the course of promoting talent competition among the eight UGC-funded universities, and whether UGC will take the lead in establishing a unified platform to foster collaboration among institutions, so as to enhance their overall international competitiveness; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether, in the face of the China-US confrontation and competition, the Government will introduce specific policy measures to encourage Hong Kong's higher education institutions to capitalise on new opportunities arising from the shifting geopolitical landscape, with a view to further strengthening Hong Kong's position as an international education hub; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  Hong Kong's overall competitiveness in education ranks among the top five in the world, and our post-secondary education is highly internationalised and diversified. To date, five University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities have been ranked among the top 100 in the world, six are ranked among the top 50 in Asia, a number of them have been ranked among the top universities in the most international universities ranking, and they have excellent research talent, which make them attractive to students and scholars from all over the world. Under the leadership of the Committee on Education, Technology and Talents led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, the Government will continue to promote Hong Kong as an international hub for high-calibre talent, co-ordinate and drive the integrated development of education, technology and talent, expand connections, formulate policies to attract and cultivate talent, and foster the co-ordinated development of technologies, so as to strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international post-secondary education hub and an international innovation and technology centre.

 Our reply to the Hon Tang Fei's question is as follows:

(1) and (3) In the light of the changes in the global higher education landscape, the Education Bureau (EDB) has promptly called on all universities in Hong Kong to introduce facilitation measures for affected students and scholars with a view to safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests, while attracting top talent in accordance with their diversified admissions and talent policies. The EDB is pleased to see that local universities are responding proactively and closely monitoring the situation, fully utilising the Government's facilitation initiatives that support the capacity expansion and quality enhancement of post-secondary institutions in Hong Kong.

 We will continue to keep a close eye on the development and accordingly consider support measures for them in a holistic approach so as to give full play to Hong Kong's role as an international post-secondary education hub. Apart from the recruitment measures of the institutions, the Government attracts more top talent to pursue their studies in Hong Kong through a range of initiatives, including doubling the cap on non-local students in publicly funded post-secondary institutions to 40 per cent, increasing scholarship quotas, and gradually increasing the number of places under the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme. We remain committed to pursuing various policies and initiatives, fostering networks and partnerships at the national, regional, and international levels, and will continue to work collaboratively with stakeholders to promote the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand. These efforts align with the national strategies to invigorate the country through science and education, cultivate high-calibre talent, and advance innovation and development, thereby contributing to meeting the needs of our country.

(2) The EDB and the UGC have been actively fostering collaboration among the eight UGC-funded universities, including supporting the jointly-established Heads of Universities Committee's Standing Committee on Internationalisation (HUCOMSCI) to promote the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand around the world. We will continue to deepen institutional collaboration through the HUCOMSCI to attract more talent from around the world and accelerate the development of Hong Kong into an international post-secondary education hub.

 Each of the eight UGC-funded universities has its own strengths and characteristics, and is making full use of the Government's facilitation policies and measures to bring their strengths into full play in recruiting and attracting more outstanding students and academics. With the Government increasing the non-local student quota for UGC-funded universities from 20 per cent to 40 per cent from the 2024/25 academic year onwards, the proportion of non-local students enrolled in UGC-funded undergraduate programmes has increased from about 19.9 per cent in 2023/24 academic year to 23.2 per cent. Universities will adopt the principle of meritocracy to attract more non-local students to study in Hong Kong. Non-local students will also make choices of further studies that suit their own strengths and interests.

 As for academic staff, the UGC-funded universities have also been actively expanding capacity while enhancing quality by increasing the number of academic staff in the UGC-funded universities from 4 974 in the 2021/22 academic year to 5 398. The universities will continue to recruit top scholars from around the world through various measures to create a favourable environment for scientific research and contribute to the development of our country and Hong Kong."
勞工及福利局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-06-18 14:38,2025-06-18 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800490.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（六月十八日）出席王軍霞落戶香港分享會後會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：見到失業率上升會否考慮暫停輸入外勞？另外政務司司長也提到現屆政府不採用貧窮線作指標，但若不用貧窮線，會否沒有客觀標準去評估政策成效？之後如何得知政府的政策是否有效？

勞工及福利局局長：我知道大家很關心有關輸入外勞的事，大家先看香港的整體狀況，現時面對的長期趨勢，一是人口老化，二是勞動人口到二○一八年已達頂峰，勞動人口一直慢慢向下跌，香港要有足夠勞動人口支撐經濟發展，所以我們推出補充勞工優化計劃，其實建基於香港的長遠形勢，推行時的大原則是確保本地工人優先就業，這是很重要的，所以大家看到優化計劃的每一宗申請也要先進行四個星期本地招聘，勞工處才會按實質需要決定是否批出配額。

昨天勞工處推出四項措施優化計劃，背後想法是希望可切切實實確保本地工人優先就業，這包括較早前已提過的投訴專線2150 6363，任何本地工人認為是因僱主聘請外勞而被解僱，請作具名投訴，我們一定從嚴處理，如屬實會對僱主作出行政制裁。另外，僱主遞交優化計劃申請後，其後六個月內提交的其他申請一般不獲處理，因為過往紀錄有約四分之一的申請是在六個月之內重複申請，最多的個案有六次，我們認為這不太妥當，希望做得更妥善。此外亦會加強巡查，若僱主使用勞工處互動就業服務網站進行四星期本地招聘，刊登職位空缺資料時會展示僱主的名稱。以上均是要致力保障本地工人優先就業。

另一點大家也關注的是精準扶貧。我們已多次提出利用貧窮線只能作相對量度，相對一個中位數看你的收入如何，就如只看體重指數（BMI）來決定一個人是否健康，而不看其他的身體徵狀，是不太適宜的，所以我們認為香港做扶貧工作要更加精準，接下來會公布有關精準扶貧的整份報告，詳細臚列我們怎樣做好扶貧、防貧、脫貧。

香港政府在社福、教育、醫療這三大範疇的開支每年超過三千多億元，佔一般經常賬支出超過六成，香港長期對於以上三大範疇，對於扶貧、抗貧、脫貧等極關重要的項目提供大量的政府公帑資助，大家都要明白我們在這方面做很多工夫。

記者：首先想了解人才計劃，較早前指年中會公布續簽情況，大概何時會公布已處理多少宗續簽和反應，當中有否發現到有個案可能提交的資料有造假的情況？第二方面想跟進關於補充勞工優化計劃，有公司在勞工處網頁聲稱聘請售貨員但實質是請魚檔工人，這類情況會怎樣跟進處理，以及為何改善措施中沒有要求僱主刊登名稱或者聯絡方式?

勞工及福利局局長：大家都很關注人才續簽的事，尤其是高端人才通行證計劃（高才通），較早前我已作解釋，高才通第一批獲得簽證人士是二○二二年年底開始，大多數是二○二三年期間取得，我們統計從今年年中開始約有一萬宗的高才的申請到期要續簽，所以要等數目較大時再作公布會較合適，這需要多些時間，現時只是六月，到年中左右才會看到多些數目，或許到今年稍後時間或我們掌握較具體和有代表性的情況時，一定會跟大家交代分析。

第二我也有留意到有報道指勞工處網頁中聲稱和實質聘請的職位不同，我們要查證清楚，究竟這是否屬實，如屬實當然會追究相關僱主，如非實情我想提醒大家要確保說法符合事實。在翻查紀錄後得知真實狀況後，一定盡量向大家公布。但大家可以放心，我們要確確實實做到本地工人優先就業，其實每一次的四星期的招聘我們亦有提醒工會的代表，每一次都希望工會代表幫忙提醒工友有招聘機會，如合適可以去面試應徵，這是我們很認真去做的。

現在我們再進一步改善措施，就是僱主在進行四星期本地招聘時，在勞工處的招聘網站要清楚指出這次招聘目的是準備打算申請外勞配額，如大家認為工作適合自己就要積極參與，當聘請了本地工人便不會再額外聘請外勞，這是必須要清楚說明的，在整個流程中要做到公平公允，一是盡可能將工作留給本地工人，這是我們最大的意願。但另一方面如實在沒有本地人願意做，亦要給僱主一個途徑，聘請外勞以填補勞動力的缺口，我希望將這事講得清楚。就剛才提及的具體個案，我已立即請勞工處跟進作深入調查，很快會跟公布事實到底如何。勞工處互動就業服務網站其實一視同仁，網站有數以萬計的工種會作同一安排。

記者：首先想跟進今次王軍霞女士和女兒來港，特區政府扮演的角色是主動邀請還是協助處理申請？局長希望王君霞女士和她女兒成為香港人之後具體對香港有甚麼貢獻？

勞工及福利局局長：我理解是王軍霞女士是通過我們的計劃提出申請的，我知道尚海龍扮演了穿針引線的角色，這是很好的，很多時候世界上優秀的人才都關注香港，但正式通過計劃申請的話，通常是有中間人提出不如考慮香港，香港一定是具有吸引力，王女士才會考慮通過優秀人才計劃成為我們的一部分。

我個人期望王女士第一件事會幫忙做好的，是向全世界說好香港故事，因為她會到世界很多不同地方，我相信她肯定做得到，通過她這麼重要的身分，她說的話很多人會報道，而且她親身體驗香港後關於香港的評論，一定可以更好地說好香港故事。當然中長期我也很希望王女士可以為香港的體育事業或經濟發展貢獻她一分力量，我相信她一定可以做得到。"
LCQ16: Opening of bank accounts by non-commercial organisations,2025-06-18 14:32,2025-06-18 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800211.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Chan Han-pan and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

 I have received a number of requests for assistance involving the opening of bank accounts by non-commercial organisations and, among them, some ""three-nil buildings"" are still unable to open bank accounts six to eight months after the formation of owners' corporations (OCs), rendering the OCs unable to raise funds for their operation. On the contrary, it takes only one to two months on average for commercial organisations to open accounts. There are views that the difficulties encountered by OCs in opening accounts have seriously affected the livelihood of the grass roots and run counter to the Government's objective of improving the community. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the total number of complaints received by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in the past three years about non-commercial organisations encountering difficulties (e.g. excessively long processing time) in opening bank accounts;

(2) whether it knows if HKMA has put in place measures to streamline the requirements for banks in vetting and approving applications from non-commercial organisations for opening accounts (in particular social service accounts such as those for OCs), so as to shorten the processing time;

(3) whether it will amend the Banking Ordinance (Cap. 155) or the licensing guidelines to expressly require banks to provide social service organisations with convenient procedures for opening accounts; and

(4) whether it knows if HKMA will set indicators to increase banks' incentive to process applications from organisations such as OCs for opening accounts, or impose penalties on banks against which complaints have been repeatedly lodged?

Reply:

President,

 To safeguard the stability of the banking system and customer interests, banks are required to comply with the relevant laws and regulatory requirements when establishing business relationship with customers. Banks are required to conduct customer due diligence (CDD) on applicants seeking to open a bank account irrespective of whether they are commercial entities or non-commercial entities (including Owners' Corporations (OCs)).

 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been closely monitoring the situation regarding bank account opening of non-commercial entities in Hong Kong. In this connection, the HKMA reminds the banking sector from time to time that while implementing robust control measures, they should also avoid creating unreasonable barriers for legitimate businesses and entities (including OCs and other non-commercial entities) to access banking services. Banks should maintain proper communication with customers throughout the CDD process, properly handle customers' account opening applications through transparent, reasonable and efficient procedures, uphold the principle of treating customers fairly, and where appropriate flexibly and pragmatically handle account opening applications.

 After consulting the HKMA, our reply to the four parts of the question is as follows:

 The HKMA issued a circular to banks in April 2023 to provide further guidance on the CDD requirements with respect to account opening for commercial entities or non-commercial entities. The circular also sets out guidance on communication with customers, understanding of market developments and risk management, as well as shares past cases and good practices for the industry's reference, so as to assist banks in achieving effective outcomes and enhancing customer experience in account opening. The HKMA has also required banks to review their account opening procedures and CDD measures, and provide staff training.

 In response to the HKMA's guidance, banks have introduced various facilitation measures in recent years to improve the account opening process for customers, covering OCs and other non-commercial entities. These measures include providing applicants with updates on the progress of their account opening applications, establishing review mechanisms and re-examining account opening applications upon customers' request. The HKMA has also set up a dedicated email and hotline to collect enquiries from the public and relevant stakeholders, which are handled and followed up by a dedicated team within the HKMA for account opening and maintenance (the dedicated team).

 Regarding the account opening application process for OCs, as an OC is an independent body corporate set up under the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344), banks would adopt CDD measures applicable to a legal person. These include requiring applicants to provide relevant registration documents of the corporation, minutes or extracts of resolutions of the management committee meeting or general meeting of the OC regarding the approval for opening a bank account and appointment of authorised signatories, as well as the identification documents of the appointed authorised signatories. Banks may also request additional information or documents from the applicants having regard to the specific circumstances and their risk assessments. The turnaround time for account opening depends on the circumstances of individual cases, as well as whether the applicant has furnished the required information. As the HKMA understood from major banks, the account opening process could generally be completed in around two weeks upon receipt of the required information and documents from applicants.

 The HKMA has been maintaining close communication with the Home Affairs Department (HAD) and offering support to the OCs seeking assistance on bank account opening under the established communication and referral mechanism. In May 2025, the HKMA and the HAD held a meeting with representatives from the banking sector for a direct exchange on matters relating to bank account opening for OCs, including a discussion on the bank account opening situations following the establishment of OCs. The participating banks responded positively and have actively introduced facilitation measures to assist OCs, including publishing information in relation to bank account opening for OCs on banks' websites; providing hotlines and contact information for OCs to enquire about account opening related information with individual banks; assigning designated staff to handle enquiries and applications in relation to bank account opening for OCs; as well as offering multiple channels and appointment arrangements to facilitate account opening for OCs. To further enhance transparency and shorten the account opening turnaround time, the HKMA, the HAD and the banking sector are jointly compiling practical information related to bank account opening, so as to assist OCs to better understand the account opening requirements and make advance preparation for the necessary documentations, with a view to enhancing customer experience.

 The numbers of complaints and requests for assistance received by the HKMA and the aforementioned dedicated team over the past three years regarding banks' handling of account opening applications by non-commercial entities are tabulated as follows:





2022
2023
2024
2025
			(as of end-May)


Complaint received by the HKMA
None
1 case
			(Note 1)
None
1 case
			(Note 2)


Request for assistance received by the dedicated team
2 cases
			(Note 3)
2 cases
			(Note 4)
None
None



Note 1: The bank concerned properly handled the complaint, and the complainant did not seek further assistance from the HKMA after communicating with the bank.
Note 2: The bank is following up on the case as requested by the HKMA.
Note 3: Two cases concerning OCs have been resolved.
Note 4: These involved one case concerning an OC and one case concerning other non-commercial entity, both of which have been resolved.

 Apart from the above cases, the HKMA also received cases referred by the HAD and district organisations from time to time, mainly concerning the bank account opening procedures and requirements for newly formed OCs. In this connection, the HKMA has provided appropriate assistance to these newly formed OCs, and these OCs have subsequently started to proceed with their bank account opening applications. The HKMA noted that for some of these cases, bank accounts were successfully opened within about two weeks on average after the OCs provided the required information to banks. In certain cases, bank accounts were opened within one week.

 The HKMA and the banking sector have implemented a series of measures to facilitate bank account opening for various businesses and entities, while ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulatory requirements. We consider that there is currently no need to introduce legislative amendments or set fixed targets regarding account opening matters. The HKMA will continue to maintain close communication and collaboration with the banking sector and relevant stakeholders on bank account opening matters, with a view to streamlining the related account opening processes and enhancing customer experience."
立法會十六題：非商業團體開立銀行帳戶,2025-06-18 14:32,2025-06-18 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800210.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上陳恒鑌議員的提問和署理財經事務及庫務局局長陳浩濂的書面答覆：

問題：

本人接獲多宗涉及非商業團體開立銀行帳戶的求助個案，當中部分「三無大廈」在成立業主立案法團（法團）後六至八個月仍無法開立銀行帳戶，導致法團無法集資運作，反觀商業機構開立帳戶平均需時僅一至二個月。有意見認為，法團開戶困難的問題已嚴重影響基層民生，與政府改善社區的目標背道而馳。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，過去三年，香港金融管理局（金管局）共收到多少宗關於非商業團體開立銀行帳戶時遇到困難（例如處理時間過長）的投訴；

（二）是否知悉，金管局有否措施簡化銀行在審批非商業團體開立帳戶（尤其是法團等社會服務類的帳戶）申請時的要求，以縮短處理時間；

（三）會否修訂《銀行業條例》（第155章）或發牌指引，明文要求銀行為社會服務機構提供便捷的開戶程序；及

（四）是否知悉，金管局會否設立指標，以加強銀行在處理法團等機構開戶申請時的積極性，或對屢遭投訴的銀行施加罰則？

答覆：

主席：

為保障銀行系統的穩健及客戶利益，銀行在與客戶建立業務關係時，均須遵守相關的法律及監管規定。不論開戶申請人是商業機構或非商業團體（包括業主立案法團（法團）），銀行為其開立帳戶前，均須對申請人進行盡職審查。

香港金融管理局（金管局）一直密切留意有關非商業團體在香港開立銀行帳戶的情況。就此，金管局不時提醒銀行業界在執行穩健管控措施的同時，也應避免對正當企業及機構（包括法團及其他非商業團體）在獲得銀行服務時造成不合理的障礙。銀行在客戶盡職審查過程中應與客戶保持良好溝通，以具透明度、合理和高效的程序妥善處理客戶的開戶申請，貫徹公平待客的原則，並且在適當的情況下靈活和務實地處理開戶申請。

就問題的四個部分，經諮詢金管局後，現回覆如下：

針對企業及機構開立銀行戶口方面，金管局已於二○二三年四月向銀行發出通函，進一步闡明相關的客戶盡職審查要求，當中亦就客戶溝通、理解市場發展及風險管控方面提供指引，並分享以往個案和良好做法供業界參考，以協助銀行在開戶方面達致有效成果和提升客戶體驗。金管局亦已要求銀行檢視其開戶程序、客戶盡職審查措施，以及提供員工培訓。

因應金管局的指引，銀行於近年推出了多項有助改善客戶辦理開戶手續的措施，涵蓋法團及其他非商業團體，包括向申請人提供開戶申請的最新進展、設立覆核機制、按客戶要求重新審視開戶申請等。金管局也透過設立專用電郵及熱線電話，收集來自公眾及相關持份者的查詢，並由金管局內的開立及維持戶口專責小組（專責小組）處理和跟進。

至於有關法團的開戶程序，法團作為根據《建築物管理條例》（第344章）成立的獨立法人組織，銀行會採納適用於與法人相關的盡職審查程序，包括要求申請人提供法團註冊的相關文件、通過開立銀行戶口及委任授權簽字人決議的管理委員會會議或法團業主大會的會議紀錄或摘錄，以及授權簽字人的身分證明文件。銀行亦會因應實際情況和風險評估需要，要求申請人提交其他資料和文件。至於開戶所需時間，則視乎個別個案的情況及申請人是否已提交所需要的資料而定。據金管局向多間主要銀行了解，銀行在收齊申請人提交所需要的資料及文件後，一般可在約兩星期內完成相關開戶手續。

金管局一直與民政事務總署（民政總署）保持緊密聯繫，並按溝通及轉介機制為有需要的法團在開立銀行戶口方面提供協助。二○二五年五月，金管局與民政總署共同與銀行業界代表會面，就法團開立銀行戶口的事宜作直接交流，包括討論有關業主成立法團後，辦理開立銀行戶口的情況。與會銀行均反應正面，亦已積極推出相關便利措施協助法團，其中包括於其銀行網頁刊載開立法團戶口的資訊；提供開戶熱線電話及銀行的聯絡方法，以方便法團就開立銀行戶口事宜向個別銀行作出查詢；由專責同事處理法團開戶查詢及申請；以及提供多個渠道及預約安排協助法團開戶。為進一步提升資訊透明度及縮短開戶所需時間，金管局、民政總署及銀行業界正合作編製開戶相關的實用資訊，讓法團更清楚了解開戶要求及預早準備開戶所需文件，以提升客戶體驗。

就金管局和上述專責小組在過去三年收到有關非商業團體就銀行處理開戶申請的投訴和求助個案數字，現表列如下：





二○二二年
二○二三年
二○二四年
二○二五年
			（截至五月底）


金管局收到的投訴
沒有
一宗（註一）
沒有
一宗（註二）


專責小組收到的求助個案
兩宗（註三）
兩宗（註四）
沒有
沒有



註一：銀行已妥善處理有關投訴，而投訴人與銀行溝通後沒有再尋求金管局協助。
註二：銀行正按金管局要求作出跟進。
註三：兩宗涉及法團的個案均已獲解決。
註四：分別涉及一宗法團個案及一宗其他非商業團體個案，均已獲解決。

除上述的個案外，金管局亦不時收到由民政總署及地區組織轉介的查詢，主要涉及新成立法團就開立銀行戶口的程序及要求。為此，金管局已向相關新成立法團提供適切協助，而相關新成立法團亦陸續向銀行提交開戶申請。金管局了解部分個案在法團向銀行提供所需的資料後，平均約在兩星期內成功開立銀行戶口。當中亦有個案可於一星期內完成開戶。

金管局及銀行業界已採取一系列措施，在符合相關法例及監管規定的前提下，便利各類企業和機構開立銀行戶口。我們認為目前無須就開戶事宜修訂法例或設定硬性指標。金管局會繼續就開立銀行戶口事宜與銀行業界及相關持份者保持緊密溝通和合作，確保銀行理順相關開戶流程，以提升客戶體驗。"
運輸署批准擴大北大嶼山自動駕駛車輛先導牌照測試路段,2025-06-18 14:00,2025-06-18 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800275.htm,"運輸署今日（六月十八日）公布，已根據《道路交通（自動駕駛車輛）規例》（第374AA章）第20（3）（b）條更新一個自動駕駛車輛先導牌照（先導牌照），擴大在北大嶼山進行自動駕駛車輛（自動車）測試的路段。

申請人已獲批准10輛自動車於東涌的指定路段和時段進行測試，每次最多可有三輛自動駕駛私家車進行路面測試。指定新增路段分別為文東路、迎禧路、怡東路、東涌東交匯處、裕東路、松仁路、順東路、東涌海濱路及惠東路。

運輸署發言人表示，北大嶼山的測試項目自二○二四年十二月啓動以來進展顯著。署方在新的自動車規管框架下提速提效，持續監察和積極推動項目並作出批核，在短短幾個月內已實現多項技術躍進，包括測試規模從單一車輛擴展至10輛同時運行以收集多車並行的數據、經評估安全後在特定路線進行指定人員的載客測試、將測試範圍延伸至交通情境更複雜道路，以及根據測試路段將最高車速上限提升至時速50公里。今次更新先導牌照進一步擴大測試路段，讓系統收集更多有用數據，評估自動車在更多不同路況及社區的表現。

所有先導自動車需於車身展示運輸署先導自動車標籤，以助其他道路使用者識別。先導牌照的詳情已上載運輸署自動車測試網頁。

運輸署歡迎有興趣的機構或企業提交自動車先導牌照申請，協力推動自動駕駛技術在香港進一步發展。在接獲先導牌照申請後，運輸署會按《自動駕駛車輛測試及先導使用實務守則》考慮申請人就自動駕駛系統的設計運行範圍及功能、相關的國際或國家標準／指引、道路測試情況等多方面因素審批。署方會嚴格把關，有序和安全地推動自動車在香港測試和發展。"
Transport Department approves route expansion for autonomous vehicles pilot licence trials in North Lantau,2025-06-18 14:00,2025-06-18 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800276.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) announced today (June 18) that a pilot licence for autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been updated in accordance with section 20(3)(b) of the Road Traffic (Autonomous Vehicles) Regulation (Cap. 374AA) to expand the routes for AV trials in North Lantau.

  The applicant has been approved to conduct trials for 10 AVs during a specified time on specified road sections in Tung Chung. Three autonomous private cars can be operated in each road test at most. The specified expanded routes cover Man Tung Road, Ying Hei Road, Yi Tung Road, Tung Chung Eastern Interchange, Yu Tung Road, Chung Yan Road, Shun Tung Road, Tung Chung Waterfront Road and Wai Tung Road.

  A spokesman for the TD said that the North Lantau project, which commenced in December 2024, has made significant progress to date. The TD has expedited ongoing monitoring, proactively taken forward the project and granted approval under the new AV regulatory framework, achieving several technical advancements within months. They included scaling up the trials from a single vehicle to 10 vehicles operating simultaneously to collect multi-vehicle data, conducting designated passenger-carrying trials on specific routes after safety assessment, expanding the trial scope to roads with more complex traffic scenarios, and increasing the maximum speed limit to 50 km/h based on the trial route. This updated pilot licence further expands the trial routes, so that more useful data can be collected to evaluate AV performance in more different road conditions and communities.

  The TD's label for pilot AV shall be displayed on all pilot AVs for identification by other road users. Details of the pilot licence have been uploaded to the TD's website on AV trials.

  The TD welcomes interested organisations or enterprises to submit applications for a pilot licence and act in concert to promote the further development of autonomous driving in Hong Kong. Upon receipt of an application, the TD will consider various factors, including the design operating range and functions of the autonomous system submitted by the applicant, relevant international or national standards/guidelines, and the road test situations, based on the Code of Practice for Trial and Pilot Use of Autonomous Vehicles before approval. The TD will exercise stringent control with a view to promoting AV trials and development in Hong Kong in a safe and orderly manner."

立法會四題：推動跨境生態旅遊,2025-06-18 13:18,2025-06-18 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800366.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上李梓敬議員的提問和署理文化體育及旅遊局局長劉震的答覆：

問題：

據報，深圳大鵬半島毗鄰香港印洲塘，具豐富的生態資源，而近年深圳及香港均有意加強生態旅遊及海洋保育上的合作。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）現時特區政府與深圳大鵬新區相關政府部門，在生態旅遊、綠色經濟及海洋保育等方面已展開的合作項目，以及達成的合作協議的詳情為何；有否統計，過去五年，該等合作項目的具體數據及成效；

（二）有否計劃推動吉澳、東平洲至大鵬半島的跨境生態旅遊及規劃相關海上航線，包括在該等地區興建「一地兩檢」碼頭；若有，現時與深圳當局磋商的詳情和進度為何，包括技術上的可行性、預計時間表及相關配套設施等；若否，原因為何；及

（三）針對上述跨境生態旅遊航線，政府有否評估其對本港旅遊業及地區經濟的預期效益，以及在環境保育上的潛在風險為何；如有，評估結果，以及因應有關結果所制訂的政策方向為何？

答覆：

主席：

根據二○二三年公布的《北部都會區行動綱領》，位於北部都會區最東部的「藍綠康樂旅遊生態圈」由紅花嶺、蓮麻坑、沙頭角、印洲塘及沿海村落和外島等組成。區內藍綠資源豐富，包括郊野公園、海岸公園和地質公園等，並擁有很多傳統鄉鎮，具有潛力作康樂及旅遊發展。

文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）在《香港旅遊業發展藍圖2.0》下提出推動香港獨特的世界級頂尖資源與旅遊的深度結合，打造特色鮮明、吸引力強的旅遊產品與項目，「生態＋旅遊」是其中一個推動方向。在尊重生態及保護環境的前提下，適度向訪客展現香港擁有的珍貴生態資源，同時盡量減低過多訪客可能對環境帶來的潛在影響，平衡保育和發展的需要。

環境及生態局轄下的漁農自然護理署（漁護署）把香港印洲塘具高生態價值地方劃為郊野公園、海岸公園和地質公園，以作保育及生態教育及康樂用途。

上述工作亦需顧及一些當地社區希望保持鄉郊寧靜環境的意見。

就李梓敬議員的提問，經諮詢環境及生態局、發展局、保安局及運輸及物流局後，現回覆如下︰

（一）特區政府與深圳當局在個別領域設立機制保持緊密合作。在生態保育及環境保護方面，隨着紅花嶺郊野公園去年成立，漁護署與深圳市規劃和自然資源局去年簽訂合作協議，推動建設深圳梧桐山和香港紅花嶺的生態廊道，包括聯合清除外來物種、進行生態調查、研究優化動物通道和加強宣傳教育。香港聯合國教科文組織世界地質公園亦與深圳大鵬半島國家地質自然公園合作於去年及今年在兩地舉行科普講座及展覽，提升兩地市民對深港地質歷史、地貌及地質公園的認識。

在海洋保育方面，環境保護署與深圳市生態環境局透過「大鵬灣及后海灣（深圳灣）區域環境管理專題小組」，完善污水收集和處理。經兩地的努力，大鵬灣的水質維持良好，對於保育海洋生態，特別是分布在香港東北水域的石珊瑚起了非常重要作用。

文體旅局與深圳當局一直按互利共贏的原則就旅遊領域加強合作，包括在平衡生態保育及旅遊發展的前提下，鼓勵業界設計有關生態旅遊的產品和路線。兩地旅遊業界也會安排相關的「踩線團」，以協助推廣工作。

（二）及（三）香港東北印州塘一帶擁有獨特的地質景觀、豐富的生態環境，以及歷史悠久的村落文化。漁護署與持份者及社區合作在該處設立了訪客中心、文化徑、陸路遊覽路線、跳島遊行程及海上遊覽路線等，為訪客帶來深度的綠色旅遊體驗。此外，環境及生態局轄下的鄉郊保育辦公室致力推動活化村落，並在二○二五年一月至二月在沙頭角谷埔舉辦「鄉郊豐年節：谷埔『聲─色─味』之旅」活動，結合當地的自然生態、歷史建築和鄉郊文化，讓大眾感受香港鄉郊的獨特魅力。

文體旅局透過在粵港、港深合作機制下成立的「對接北部都會區發展策略專班」下的「沙頭角合作區工作小組」，以「低密度、高質量」和深化歷史文化元素的原則，與深方推進沙頭角及附近地方（包括吉澳）的旅遊發展。文體旅局亦一直鼓勵業界開發多元化的特色旅遊產品。現時內地遊客可以便捷地經各出入境口岸入境香港參加本地行程，包括香港境內的生態旅遊路線。早前，我們聯同香港旅遊業議會積極為香港與深圳兩地業界穿針引綫，例如在去年十二月為深圳鹽田區旅遊業界舉辦沙頭角跳島「踩線團」，到訪荔枝窩、吉澳和鴨洲等景點，設計從蓮塘／香園圍口岸入境後的沙頭角跳島團。

至於問題第二部分所提及的興建一地兩檢碼頭以發展深圳東部水域與香港北部都會區的跨境航線，的確會如問題第三部分所述，牽涉眾多複雜考量，包括有關航線的長遠市場需求和區域的承載力；需要提供的基建配套，伴隨的規劃改動、以致基建投資的經濟及成本效益；需要面對的安保挑戰；以及可能對生態環境帶來的潛在影響等，需要兩地政府從長計議。

多謝主席。"
LCQ4: Promoting cross-boundary eco-tourism,2025-06-18 13:18,2025-06-18 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800367.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Dominic Lee and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Mr Raistlin Lau, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

It has been reported that the Dapeng Peninsula of Shenzhen, which is adjacent to Yan Chau Tong of Hong Kong, possesses rich ecological resources, and both Shenzhen and Hong Kong have expressed intentions in recent years to strengthen cooperation in eco-tourism and marine conservation. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the details of cooperation projects commenced and co-operation agreements reached between the SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government and the relevant government departments of Dapeng New District, Shenzhen in terms of, among others, eco-tourism, green economy, and marine conservation; whether it has compiled statistics on the specific data and effectiveness of such co-operation projects over the past five years;

(2) whether it has plans to promote cross-boundary eco-tourism from Kat O and Tung Ping Chau to the Dapeng Peninsula and devise related sea routes, including the construction of piers for ""co-location arrangement"" in such areas; if so, of the details and progress of the ongoing negotiations with Shenzhen authorities, including technical feasibility, estimated timetable, and related ancillary facilities; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether the Government has assessed the expected benefits of the aforementioned cross-boundary eco-tourism routes for Hong Kong's tourism industry and local economy, as well as the potential risks involved in environmental conservation; if so, of the assessment results, and the policy directions determined in response to such results?

Reply:

President,

According to the Northern Metropolis (NM) Action Agenda announced in 2023, the Blue and Green Recreation, Tourism and Conservation Circle situated in the easternmost part of the NM comprises Robin's Nest, Lin Ma Hang, Sha Tau Kok, Yan Chau Tong as well as coastal villages and the outlying islands. With abundant blue and green resources including country parks, marine parks and geopark as well as a number of traditional rural townships, this zone has the potential for recreation and tourism development.

As set out in the Development Blueprint for Hong Kong's Tourism Industry 2.0, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) promotes in-depth integration of Hong Kong's unique world-class resources with tourism, and crafts tourism products and projects with distinctive features and strong appeal, with ""Ecology+Tourism"" being one of the development strategies. On the premises of respecting the nature and protecting the environment, we will appropriately unveil Hong Kong's precious ecological resources to visitors, and at the same time minimise the potential environmental impact due to too many visitors as far as practicable, thereby balancing the needs for conservation and tourism development.

The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) under the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) has designated places of high ecological value in Yan Chau Tong as country park, marine park and geopark, for conservation and eco-education and recreation purposes.

In taking forth the above work, the wish of some local communities for maintaining a quiet countryside environment should also be considered.

Having consulted the EEB, the Development Bureau, the Security Bureau and the Transport and Logistics Bureau, a consolidated reply in response to the questions raised by the Hon Dominic Lee is as follows:

(1) The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government has established mechanisms with the Shenzhen authorities for the cooperation in individual areas. On ecological conservation and environmental protection, following the establishment of the Robin's Nest Country Park last year, the AFCD and the Planning and Natural Resources Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality signed the Cooperation Agreement last year on the establishment of the ecological corridor between Shenzhen Wutong Mountain and Hong Kong Robin's Nest, including jointly removing invasive species, conducting ecological surveys, examining enhancement of animal corridors and enhancing publicity and education. The Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark also collaborated with the Shenzhen Dapeng Peninsula National Geological Natural Park to hold science lectures and exhibitions in both locations last year and this year, enabling citizens of both sides to have better understanding of the geological history, landforms, and geoparks of the two places.

On marine conservation, the Environmental Protection Department and the Ecology and Environment Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality have been improving sewage collection and treatment through the Mirs Bay and Deep Bay (Shenzhen Bay) Areas Environmental Management Special Panel. With the concerted efforts of both sides, the water quality of Mirs Bay has been kept at a good level, and it is conducive to the conservation of marine ecology, especially the hard corals in the northeast waters of Hong Kong.

The CSTB has been strengthening co-operation with the Shenzhen authorities in the tourism aspect under the principle of mutual benefits, including encouraging the trade to design eco-tourism products and itineraries on the premise of striking a balance between ecological conservation and tourism development. The travel trade of the Shenzhen and Hong Kong will also organise relevant familiarisation visits to help with the promotion work.

(2) and (3) Yan Chau Tong in the northeastern part of Hong Kong possesses unique geological landscape, rich ecology and village culture with long history. The AFCD has, in collaboration with stakeholders and the local community, established visitor centers, cultural trails, land tour routes, island-hopping itineraries, and maritime tour routes, providing tourists an in-depth green tour experience. In addition, the Countryside Conservation Office under the EEB is dedicated to revitalising villages, and held the Countryside Harvest Festival: Kuk Po 'Sound, Sight, Taste Fusion' Tour at Kuk Po in Sha Tau Kok from January to February 2025. The event blended local natural ecology, historical architecture and countryside culture, allowing the public to experience the unique charm of Hong Kong's countryside.

Through the Working Group for Sha Tau Kok Co-operation Zone set up under the Task Force for Collaboration on the Northern Metropolis Development Strategy under the Guangdong-Hong Kong and Hong Kong-Shenzhen co-operation mechanism, the CSTB collaborates with Shenzhen to promote the tourism development in Sha Tau Kok and nearby areas (including Kat O) under the overall principle of ""low density, high quality"" and through enriching its historical and cultural elements. The CSTB has also been encouraging the business sector to develop diversified tourism products. At present, Mainland visitors can conveniently enter Hong Kong through various boundary control points to join local tours, including eco-tourism itineraries in Hong Kong. Earlier on, in collaboration with the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong, the CSTB actively engaged with the trade in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. For instance, the CSTB organised the Sha Tau Kok island-hopping familiarisation tour for the travel trade from Yantian District of Shenzhen in December last year, which included visits to Lai Chi Wo, Kat O and Ap Chau, etc, for designing Sha Tau Kok island-hopping tours after crossing the boundary from the Liantang/Heung Yuen Wai Boundary Control Point.

As regards the construction of piers for ""co-location arrangement"" for developing cross-boundary ferry routes between the eastern waters of Shenzhen and the NM area of Hong Kong as mentioned in part two of the question, it will indeed involve a number of complex considerations as mentioned in part three of the question, including the long-term market demand for the ferry routes concerned and the carrying capacity of the region; the infrastructure facilities that are required, the consequential change of planning as well as the economic and cost-effectiveness of the infrastructure investment; the security challenges that will have to be faced; and the potential impacts on the ecological environment, etc. which require long-term consideration by both sides of the governments.

Thank you President."
立法會六題：保障本地勞工優先就業,2025-06-18 13:00,2025-06-18 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800270.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上陳克勤議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的答覆：

問題：

「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃）至今的批准輸入勞工人數超過五萬人。另一方面，政府最新公布的失業率為百分之三點四，是27個月以來高位。關於保障本地勞工優先就業，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於據報，有優化計劃申請企業在進行本地招聘時，設定不合理條件以排除本地應徵者，過去三年，涉及本地招聘程序違規的投訴或舉報，以及當中查明屬實的個案數目及有關處罰為何；有何機制主動核查該等招聘條件的合理性；

（二）鑑於據報，在優化計劃要求企業的外勞對本地勞工比例不得低於一比二的情況下，有企業以兼職方式聘請本地員工，或安排外勞擔任與申請不一致的崗位，政府有否了解有關情況；及

（三）過去三年，被拘捕的非法勞工人數為何，並按從事行業列出分項數字；有否評估，現行對非法勞工僱主及有關中介機構的處罰措施是否具足夠阻嚇力？

答覆：

主席：

為應對人力短缺帶來的挑戰，在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，政府已加強輸入勞工的機制。除為建造業、運輸業，以及安老院和殘疾人士院舍推出行業輸入勞工計劃外，勞工處自二○二三年九月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），暫停執行原有「補充勞工計劃」下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位一般不得輸入勞工的規定，為期兩年。

就議員的提問，經諮詢保安局，現答覆如下：

（一）勞工處一直嚴謹處理每宗優化計劃的申請。僱主必須先進行四星期本地招聘，優先聘請合適的本地工人填補空缺。勞工處會審視及確認僱主在本地招聘期間所有職位空缺的聘用條件，包括入職和學歷要求、每月薪酬及工作時數。僱主在本地招聘期間經任何途徑聘用本地求職者，均不得提供遜於勞工處同意的聘用條件。

僱主完成本地招聘程序後，須向勞工處匯報結果並遞交招聘廣告作核對。勞工處會聯繫每名不獲僱主聘用的本地求職者，評估僱主是否有誠意聘用本地工人。如有證據顯示僱主違反本地招聘的規定，或無合理理由拒絕聘用合資格的本地求職者，勞工處會施加行政制裁，中止處理有關僱主提交的輸入勞工申請，並拒絕處理僱主在隨後一年提交的其他申請。自推行優化計劃以來，勞工處沒有發現僱主違反本地招聘的規定或接獲求職者的相關投訴。

（二）為保障本地工人的就業機會，優化計劃規定有關僱主須持續符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例的規定，即二比一。全職僱員是指僱主直接僱用而每周總工作時數不少於35小時以經營相關業務的本地僱員，不包括兼職僱員、向僱主提供服務的外判商員工或自僱人士。同時，僱主不得以輸入勞工取代在職本地僱員。如需裁員，僱主應先裁減輸入勞工。為確保僱主不會在聘請輸入勞工後解僱本地工人，勞工處已設立投訴專線，電話號碼是2150 6363。我呼籲僱員如懷疑因僱主聘用輸入勞工而遭解僱，請致電熱線，勞工處會嚴肅跟進。如情況屬實，勞工處會對有關僱主作出行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准，以及拒絕處理僱主在隨後兩年提交的其他申請。

此外，優化計劃的輸入勞工必須按照政府訂定的標準僱傭合約（標準合約）條款受聘，並按標準合約所訂，在指定的工作地點擔任指定的職位及執行指定的職務。

勞工處的勞工督察不時巡查優化計劃下輸入勞工的工作地點，查核僱主有否遵守《僱傭條例》和優化計劃的規定，並要求僱主申報全職本地僱員及輸入勞工的資料和相關人手比例。僱主如違反相關規定，包括不符合人手比例的規定、安排輸入勞工擔任標準合約訂明以外的職務，勞工處會對僱主作出行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准，以及拒絕處理僱主在隨後最多兩年提交的其他申請。

（三）從事非法工作屬嚴重罪行，僱主和非法勞工及協助和教唆他人從事非法工作的人士均會根據《入境條例》被檢控。《入境條例》載有不同條文，針對不同人士的相關犯罪行為。訪客、非法入境者及逾期逗留人士等均不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。協助及教唆者同罪。此外，政府於二○二一年修訂《入境條例》，增加對僱主僱用非法勞工的刑罰，最高刑罰由原來的罰款35萬元和監禁三年大幅提高至罰款50萬元和監禁10年，反映有關罪行的嚴重性。另外，任何人違反逗留條件從事任何有薪或無薪僱傭工作，即屬犯罪，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。此外，如有本港的職業介紹所或其有關連人士因違反《入境條例》被定罪，勞工處可考慮撤銷或拒絕續發有關職業介紹所的牌照。如該些人士日後申請經辦其他職業介紹所，勞工處亦會考慮拒絕發出牌照。

政府一直致力打擊非法勞工，從而保障本地工人的就業機會。相關執法機關會視乎行動需要、風險評估及其他考慮因素，靈活調配人手持續執行情報主導的行動，有需要時會展開聯合行動，嚴厲打擊與非法勞工相關的罪行。

根據入境事務處的紀錄，二○二二年至二○二四年，每年分別有886‍名、1304名和1268名非法勞工被拘捕。今年一月至五‍月，被拘捕的非法勞工有506名。被捕的非法勞工主要從事與餐飲、建造、清潔或零售批發行業有關的工作。"

LCQ6: Safeguarding employment priority for local workers,2025-06-18 13:00,2025-06-18 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800272.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hak-kan and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

 The number of imported workers approved under the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) has exceeded 50 000 to date. On the other hand, the latest unemployment rate announced by the Government is 3.4 per cent, the highest in 27 months. Regarding the safeguarding of the employment priority for local workers, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it has been reported that some applicant enterprises have set unreasonable criteria to exclude local applicants when conducting local recruitment under ESLS, of the number of complaints or reports involving non-compliant local recruitment procedures in the past three years and, among them, the number of substantiated cases and the relevant penalties; of the mechanism in place for proactively reviewing the reasonableness of such recruitment criteria;

(2) as it has been reported that since ESLS requires enterprises to maintain a manning ratio of imported labour to local labour of no less than 1:2, some enterprises have employed local workers on a part-time basis or arranged for imported workers to take up positions inconsistent with those they applied for, whether the Government has looked into such situations; and

(3) of the number of illegal workers arrested in the past three years, together with a breakdown by the trade in which they were engaged; whether it has assessed if the existing penal measures against employers of illegal workers and the intermediaries concerned have sufficient deterrent effect?

Reply:

President,

  To cope with the challenges brought by manpower shortage and on the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, the Government has enhanced the mechanism for importation of labour. Apart from launching sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction sector, transport sector, and residential care homes for the elderly and residential care homes for persons with disabilities, the Labour Department (LD) has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023 to suspend the general exclusion of the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts from labour importation under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme for two years.

 In consultation with the Security Bureau, the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) The LD has all along been stringently processing each application under ESLS. Applicant employers must undertake a four-week local recruitment exercise and accord priority to employing suitable local workers to fill the job vacancies. The LD will review and ascertain the employment terms, including the entry and academic qualification requirements, monthly salary and hours of work of all job vacancies posted by employers during the local recruitment. Employers taking on local job seekers through any recruitment channels during the local recruitment shall offer them employment terms no less favourable than those agreed by the LD.

  Upon completion of the local recruitment procedures, employers shall report the results to the LD and submit recruitment advertisements for verification. The LD will contact each of the local job seekers who is not employed by the employers, and assess whether the employers have sincerity in recruiting local workers. If there is evidence showing that an employer has violated the requirements of local recruitment, or refused to employ qualified local job seekers without reasonable reasons, the LD will impose administrative sanction of terminating the processing of the application submitted by the concerned employer for importation of labour, and refusing to process other applications submitted by the employer in the following year. Since the implementation of ESLS, the LD has not detected any employer who has violated the requirements of local recruitment or received relevant complaint from job seekers.

(2) To safeguard the employment opportunities of local workers, ESLS requires relevant employers to meet the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers of 2:1 on a continuous basis. Full-time employees refer to local employees who are directly employed by an employer and work not less than 35 hours per week for operating the relevant business, excluding part-time staff, staff of sub-contractor(s) or self-employed person(s) providing services to the employer. At the same time, the employer shall not displace local workers in employ with imported workers. In the event of redundancy, imported workers should be retrenched first. To ensure that employers will not displace local workers in employ with imported workers, the LD has set up a dedicated hotline of 2150 6363. I appeal to employees who suspect that they have been dismissed owing to the employment of imported workers to call the hotline. The LD will follow up the complaints seriously. If substantiated, the LD will impose administrative sanction on the concerned employers, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of labour previously granted and refusal to process other applications submitted by the employers in the following two years.

  Besides, imported workers under ESLS must be employed under the Standard Employment Contract (SEC) prescribed by the Government, and shall perform specified duties for the specified job at the specific workplace(s) stipulated in the SEC.

  Labour Inspectors of the LD inspect workplaces of imported workers under ESLS from time to time to check whether employers have complied with the Employment Ordinance and the requirements of ESLS, and require employers to report information on full-time local employees and imported workers as well as the relevant manning ratios. If an employer violates the relevant requirements, including failing to meet the manning ratio requirement or arranging imported workers to perform duties other than those stipulated in SEC, the LD will impose administrative sanction on the employer, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of labour previously granted to the employer and refusal to process other applications submitted by the employer for up to two years.

(3) Engaging in illegal employment is a serious offence. Employers, illegal workers as well as aiders and abettors of illegal employment will be liable to prosecution in accordance with the Immigration Ordinance (IO). The IO stipulates different provisions targeting relevant offences committed by different groups of people. Visitors, illegal immigrants, overstayers, etc, are prohibited from taking up any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Aiders and abettors are liable to the same penalties. In addition, the Government amended the IO in 2021 to increase the penalty on employers of illegal workers, with the maximum penalty significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment with a view to reflecting the gravity of such offences. Besides, any person who takes up any employment, whether paid or unpaid, in contravention of a condition of stay shall be guilty of an offence.Upon conviction, he/she is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. In addition, if local employment agencies or their persons in relation are convicted of breaches of the IO, the LD may consider revoking or refusing the renewal of license for the concerned employment agencies. If the concerned persons apply for operating other employment agencies in future, the LD may also consider rejecting the issue of license.

  The Government is committed to combatting illegal employment, with a view to protecting the job opportunities for the local workforce. Relevant law enforcement agencies will, depending on operational needs, risk assessment and other considerations, flexibly arrange sufficient manpower to continuously conduct intelligence-led operations. When necessary, they will conduct joint operations to rigorously combat crimes related to illegal employment.

  According to the records of the Immigration Department, there were respectively 886, 1304 and 1268 illegal workers arrested each year during 2022 to 2024. 506 illegal workers were arrested during January to May 2025. The illegal workers arrested were mainly engaged in work related to the catering, construction, cleaning, or retail and wholesale industries."
AFCD to hold Local Organic Watermelon Festival 2025 (with photos),2025-06-18 13:00,2025-06-18 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061700364.htm,"âThe Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) will hold the Local Organic Watermelon Festival 2025 from June 20 to feature four highlighted varieties of organic watermelons this year.

A spokesman for the AFCD said today (June 18), ""The annual Local Organic Watermelon Festival promotes local organic watermelons and other premium agricultural products, enhances sustainability of local agriculture, and provides farmers with opportunities to share their harvests and engage with the public.""

At the Local Organic Watermelon Festival 2025, four highlighted varieties of watermelons, namely Reyan 2K, Hami Yellow Flesh, Super Sweet Black Angel 168 and Diana, will be featured. The Reyan 2K, a new variety introduced this year, is oblong with green, dark striped skin, has a thin rind and intense juicy red flesh with a sweetness of around 12 degrees Brix (degrees of Brix denote the units for measuring sucrose content in solution). The Hami Yellow Flesh, also oblong with dark green, striped skin, has yellowish-orange flesh and a sweetness of around 10 degrees Brix. The Super Sweet Black Angel 168 is small and spherical with dark striped skin and green and bright crimson-coloured flesh, also with a sweetness of around 12 degrees Brix. Diana, oblong with bright striped skin in yellow, features intense red flesh and a sweetness of around 11 degrees Brix. Local organic watermelons generally have a sweetness ranging from 8 to 12 degrees Brix.

The AFCD, together with the Vegetable Marketing Organization (VMO), the Federation of Vegetable Marketing Co-operative Societies Ltd and the MTR Corporation Limited will co-organise the first four-day organic farmers' market of the Local Organic Watermelon Festival 2025. The public can buy local organic agricultural products at Maritime Square 1 from June 20 to June 23. The event will also feature booth games and workshops, providing recreational activities for the public.

Furthermore, the AFCD will continue to invite all regular organic farmers' markets to join the Local Organic Watermelon Festival. Starting from July, the public can purchase local organic watermelons and other seasonal vegetables and fruits at organic farmers' markets across various districts. They can also order from the VMO via the ""Local Fresh"" website (www.localfreshhk.com) and mobile application or purchase from certified organic farmers listed on the Hong Kong Organic Resource Centre Certification Limited website (www.hkorc-cert.org/en). The opening dates and times of these farmers' markets are listed in the Annex. Local organic watermelons as well as other seasonal vegetables and fruits are available for a limited time while stocks last.

Question:

It is learnt that the Highways Department (HyD) adopts innovative technologies and promotes management digitalisation to enhance the efficiency in road repair and maintenance services. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the total length of public roads in Hong Kong, the total length of public roads repaired and the total project cost for repair of public roads in each of the past three years; the respective details of the contracts awarded for repair and maintenance of such roads (including but not limited to the names of contractors, districts involved, contract periods, length of the roads involved and contract values);

(2) as the Government indicated in its reply to a question from a Member of this Council on March 27 last year that the HyD aimed to digitalise most inspection and supervision procedures in all road maintenance contracts in 2024, of the progress of the relevant work; whether it has assessed how the adoption of innovative technologies help enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of road inspection, including the savings in manpower expenditure and project cost; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) given that, according to the information from the HyD, the HyD is using the Road Defect Detection System (RDDS) and the Road Condition Assessment System (RCAS) for inspection of road conditions, of the respective application scenarios, stages of application (e.g. at trial stage or being converted to regular use), efficiency of inspection and cost-effectiveness of the two systems;

(4) given that, according to the estimation of HyD, the introduction of RCAS will be able to free up about one-fourth of the manpower of the contractors' road inspection teams, and the HyD is now evaluating the effectiveness of RCAS and will consider in due course the full scale application of the technology and its incorporation into the standard operating procedures for future road inspections, of the latest progress of the relevant work, and whether it has studied if future deployment will be implemented by adopting both systems, namely RDDS and RCAS, or either one of them; and

(5) given that HyD is one of the selected applicants for the first batch of low-altitude economy Regulatory Sandbox pilot projects, of the details of HyD's pilot projects involving road repair and maintenance as well as road inspection (including but not limited to the contents of the projects, application scenarios, flight paths, route plans and flight distances)?

Reply:

President,

Having consulted the Highways Department (HyD), my reply to the various parts of the question raised by Hon Chan Siu-hung is as follows:

(1) In the past three years (i.e. from 2022 to 2024), the total length of roads maintained by the HyD each year was 2 223, 2 239 and 2 241 kilometres respectively. The annual expenditure on maintenance of roads and associated road facilities was about $1.70 billion, $1.73 billion, and $1.66 billion respectively.

The HyD ensures the safety and reliability of the public road network by engaging road maintenance contractors under term contracts to carry out regular inspection and maintenance work. When damage to road surfaces is identified during inspections or damages to roads and ancillary road facilities are reported by the public, the HyD would arrange contractors to carry out repair works as soon as possible to defects that may pose hazard to road users. As such repairs are part of the routine road maintenance work, the HyD does not separately keep statistics on the area of such type of road surface maintained.

Moreover, for defects that do not pose immediate danger to road safety, the HyD would formulate appropriate maintenance plan and schedule for such defects after taking into account various factors, such as arranging road resurfacing at a timely juncture. In each of the past three years (i.e. from 2022 to 2024), the areas of roads resurfaced and reconstructed by HyD are about 1.55, 1.77 and 1.65 million square metre respectively.

Currently, the HyD has a total of 9 road maintenance contracts for the maintenance of all public roads in Hong Kong, details of which are at Annex.

(2) At present, the Road Maintenance Monitoring System (RMMS), which is a system that fully digitalises the monitoring and administrative work of road maintenance, has been used in all road maintenance contracts. In the past, whenever the HyD's staff identified defects in road facilities during inspection, they were required to fill in and send the relevant physical form to the contractors upon completion of the inspections. With the RMMS, staff can now log on to the system during outdoor inspections and electronically notify the contractors of the information on damage to facilities captured on site, so that contractors can receive the relevant data promptly and arrange for repair works accordingly. After completion of repair works, contractors can also use RMMS to report the work done and submit maintenance records. The adoption of RMMS can cut down on complicated paperwork and transmission time to enhance work efficiency, facilitating HyD's staff to monitor the progress of maintenance. It resulted in better maintenance record keeping as well as reduction in the use of paper. In addition, the HyD is now developing the second phase of RMMS, which will incorporate more monitoring and management functions, such as automatic alerts or warnings to contractors with unsatisfactory maintenance progress, as well as digitalised checking procedures, etc.

In terms of cost-effectiveness, with the full implementation of the first phase of the RMMS, the average time taken by the HyD's staff to handle a case of damaged road facility (from the discovery of damage to road facility to the completion of the repair works) is about 20 per cent faster than before. Subsequently, upon completion and full adoption of the second phase of the RMMS, the HyD will then consider adjusting the manpower requirements of contractors for new road maintenance works. At that time, the HyD would re-assess the savings in manpower expenditure and works cost arising from the use of RMMS, as well as the cost-effectiveness of the system.

(3) The Road Defect Detection System (RDDS) utilises high-definition cameras installed on inspection patrol vehicles to capture images of road conditions, and employs global satellite positioning technology to record the locations of such images. It then uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to automatically identify road surface cracks and discoloured road markings, instead of relying on the visual inspection by road inspectors as in the past to ensure that the detection results are objective and accurate (above 90 per cent accuracy). Contractors use inspection patrol vehicles equipped with RDDS to carry out comprehensive inspection of all roads in Hong Kong once every three months. The detection results of road defects will be displayed on a web-based maintenance platform equipped with geographic information system maps, to facilitate maintenance personnel to locate the defects and carry out repair works. Moreover, the RDDS can consolidate relevant information into defect reports for maintenance personnel to record and audit the maintenance status. With enhanced inspection accuracy and maintenance records, the required maintenance works can be completed more swiftly and efficiently. At present, the RDDS has been incorporated as a standard operating procedure for road inspection on a regular basis. With the full adoption of RDDS, the average time taken by the contractors from completion of road inspection work to submission of the relevant inspection report has been substantially reduced from 48 hours to within 24 hours. To further enhance the efficiency of road maintenance, the HyD would expand the analytical capability of the AI system of the RDDS to identify more different types of road defects, such as overgrown vegetation, as well as discoloured/obstructed/bent traffic signs on the road surface.

The Road Condition Assessment System (RCAS), which scans three-dimensional images of road surfaces, uses patrol vehicles equipped with laser scanning equipment and global satellite positioning technology to drive on a carriageway at normal speed, and can automatically identify and accurately record various types of defects on the road surface such as potholes, rutting etc. It calculates a Pavement Condition Index (PCI) for every 100 metres of the road for the reference of engineering personnel responsible for maintenance to determine whether the section of road should be prioritised for reconstruction or resurfacing works. Compared to the past when road inspectors had to conduct visual inspection and measurement on the road surface after making road closure arrangements, which only covered a few hundred meters of carriageways per day at most, RCAS enables the maintenance team to have a more comprehensive grasp of the latest conditions of all road surfaces without the need for road closures. This allows for more effective use of resources when planning road maintenance works, and also helps avoid disruption to traffic.

The HyD expects that after using RCAS to inspect all major road sections in Hong Kong, it will be able to make more effective use of resources by prioritising sections with poorer conditions for road maintenance. RCAS is still in the trial stage and is capable of inspecting about 200 km of carriageways per day. It is expected that during the one year trial period, all major road sections in Hong Kong can be inspected and the data collected will be used for establishing a web-based maintenance platform for use by engineering staff.

As RCAS is still at the trial stage, the cost-effectiveness of the technology is still being assessed. However, according to preliminary estimation, the introduction of RCAS can free up about one-fourth of the manpower of the contractors' road inspection teams to cope with the increasing road maintenance work.

(4) Since 2024, the HyD has engaged various service contractors through road maintenance contracts to participate in the development of RCAS which is used to accurately record the undulations of road surfaces and identify road defects such as potholes, to facilitate the planning of road maintenance work. The aforesaid development project is broadly divided into three stages: in the first stage, the service contractors are required to procure vehicles and install laser scanning equipment and positioning devices on the vehicles; in the second stage, the service contractors are required to develop an AI and geometric analysis algorithm system to automatically detect road defects, assess road conditions, and establish a Geographic Information System (GIS) web-based platform to disseminate the relevant information; and in the third stage, the service contractors are required to utilise this system to scan all road surfaces in Hong Kong and automatically assess road conditions, as well as upload the assessment results to the GIS web-based platform at the same time. The first and second stages have been completed, while work on the third stage has commenced and is anticipated to be completed within this year. The HyD is evaluating the effectiveness of the entire smart road conditions analysis system and would consider incorporating this technology into the standard operating procedures for future road inspections in due course.

Currently, the RDDS is used for rapid identification of cracks on road surface and discoloured road markings which facilitates maintenance staff to locate road defects and expedite the completion of the required maintenance works, thereby enhancing maintenance efficiency. Meanwhile, RCAS focuses on accurately identifying and recording various types of defects on road surfaces and their degree of deterioration. It calculates the PCI for every 100m of carriageway which will help maintenance staff to determine whether a road section should be prioritised for resurfacing works. In view of the distinctive functions of RDDS and RCAS, as well as their differences in speed and accuracy in detecting road conditions, the positioning of their applications is thus different. These two systems will be implemented in parallel at this stage. However, the HyD will continue to develop the functions of RDDS and RCAS and will not rule out the possibility of merging them in the future when their functions, speed, and accuracy become comparable.

(5) According to the requirements of the existing Small Unmanned Aircraft (SUA) Order, the ""pilot"" controlling a SUA is required to maintain visual-line-of-sight with SUA under standard operation. The HyD's Regulatory Sandbox project utilises beyond visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) technology, coupled with 4G/5G command and control links, to enable SUA to operate beyond the pilot's line-of-sight in a safer and more stable manner, up to a distance of several kilometres. This enables flexible deployment for surveying and inspecting road infrastructures and major trunk roads during emergencies, such as landslides, as well as routine operation.

In emergency situations, with the adoption of BVLOS technology, SUA can swiftly reach a remote landslide site and calculate a three-dimensional model of the slope through aerial photographs taken, which facilitates engineers to accurately measure the area and volume of landslide debris in support of slope restoration work. In addition, under extreme weather condition, SUA can be operated to fly along designated pre-set routes to quickly see whether there are any flooding, fallen trees, or other obstructions on major highways. For routine surveys and inspections, BVLOS technology can assist in the inspections in places such as cross-sea bridges, confined spaces and elevated structures that are difficult for engineering personnel to access or visually inspect. Such technology can be regularly applied to routine operations, such as surface defect inspection of bridge structures and slope restoration works.

The test flights of the Regulatory Sandbox project are conducted in stages under different scenarios, at locations including Tai Po Waterfront Pier to Sam Mun Tsai, Tseung Kwan O Tunnel Road, Tseung Kwan O Cross Bay Link, Tate's Cairn Highway, and Ap Lei Chau Bridge. These simulated flights carry out BVLOS inspections of slopes along the roads at the above locations and the related major trunk roads, with flying distances ranging from 200m to 2 000m. Among them, the HyD has already completed the trial flights at the first two test sites, with the remaining three expected to be completed in phases by the end of September 2025."
立法會十二題：公共道路的維修保養,2025-06-18 12:50,2025-06-18 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800251.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上陳紹雄議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉，路政署採用創新科技及推展數字化管理，以提升道路維修和保養工程服務的效率。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年全港公共道路的總長度、已維修公共道路總長度及用於維修公共道路的總工程費用分別為何；就該等道路維修及保養工作所批出的合約詳情（包括但不限於承建商名稱、涉及區域、合約年期、涉及道路長度及合約金額）分別為何；

（二）鑑於政府於去年三月二十七日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，路政署的目標是在二○二四年內把所有道路維修合約的大部分巡查及監督程序數碼化，相關工作的進展為何；有否評估，採用創新科技如何提高道路檢測的效率及成本效益，包括所節省的人手開支及工程成本；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（四）鑑於路政署估算，引入RCAS能釋放承建商巡路隊約四分之一的人手，而該署正評估RCAS的成效，並會適時考慮將其全面應用並納入日後道路巡查的標準作業程序，相關工作的最新進展為何，以及有否研究，RDDS及RCAS兩套系統未來的應用模式是雙軌並行，或是擇一而行；及

（五）鑑於路政署是低空經濟「監管沙盒」首批試點項目的入選申請機構，該署涉及道路維修保養及勘察的試點項目（包括但不限於項目內容、應用場景、飛行路徑、航線規劃及飛行距離）的詳情為何？

答覆：

主席：

就陳議員提問的各部分，經諮詢路政署後，現回覆如下：

（一）過去三年（即二○二二年至二○二四年），每年由路政署保養的道路總長度分別為2 223、2 239及2 241公里，而每年維修道路及相關道路設施的開支則分別約為17億元、17億3千萬元及16億6千萬元。

路政署透過定期合約委聘道路維修承建商進行定期巡查及維修保養工作，以確保公共道路網絡的安全和可靠性。當在巡查時發現路面有損毀或接獲市民意見指路面或附屬道路設施有破損時，路政署會安排承建商盡快對可能構成道路危險的損毀進行修復工作。由於這些修葺工作屬於日常道路維修工作的一部分，所以路政署並沒有就這類的維修道路面積分別作統計。

此外，對於不會對道路安全構成即時危險的破損，路政署會在考慮不同因素後，為該些破損制定合適的維修計劃和時間表，例如適時為路面進行重鋪工程。過去三年（即二○二二年至二○二四年），每年路政署重鋪及重建道路的面積分別約為1.55、1.77及1.65百萬平方米。

目前路政署共有九份道路維修工程合約，負責全港公共道路的維修護養，合約詳情見附件。

（二）現時，電子化道路維修監察系統（Road Maintenance Monitoring System, RMMS）已在所有道路維修工程合約中使用。RMMS是將道路維修的監察及行政工作全面電子化的系統。每當路政署工程人員在巡查時發現有道路設施受損，過去的做法是要工程人員在完成巡查後填寫並傳送有關的實體表格至承建商。通過RMMS，現時工程人員在戶外巡查時只需登入系統，便能把實地擷取有關設施受損的資料以電子方式通知承建商，承建商迅即可收到有關資料並安排維修工作。承建商在完成維修工作後亦可使用RMMS匯報完工及提交維修記錄。採用RMMS能減省繁複的文書工作及傳送時間，以提高工作效率，方便路政署工程人員監察維修進度，不但令維修保養記錄做得更妥善，亦可以減少使用紙張。此外，路政署正在開發RMMS的第二階段，將納入更多監察管理功能，例如對維修進度不理想的承建商自動發出提示或警告、電子化的審查程序等。

就成本效益方面，隨着RMMS首階段的全面使用後，現時路政署工程人員處理道路設施受損個案（從發現道路設施受損至完成有關設施的修復工作）的平均時間比過往快約20%。及後，當RMMS完成第二階段的開發且全面使用後，路政署會考慮在新道路維修工程中調整承建商在人力資源上的要求。屆時，路政署將再次評估使用RMMS可節省的人手開支及工程成本，以及系統的成本效益。

（三）人工智能偵測道路欠妥系統（Road Defect Detection System, RDDS）利用在巡路檢測車上安裝的高清相機拍攝路面情況，並用全球衛星定位技術記錄相片位置，再以人工智能技術自動識別路面裂縫及褪色路面標記，代替過往依靠巡路人員的目測，確保偵測的結果客觀而且準確（準確度達90%以上）。承建商利用配備RDDS設備的巡路檢測車，每三個月為全港的道路進行一次全面的偵測，道路欠妥偵測結果會顯示在配備地理資訊系統地圖的網絡維修平台上，方便維修人員找出欠妥位置及進行維修。此外，RDDS亦可整合有關資料作為欠妥報告，方便維修人員記錄和審核維修情況。當道路巡查的準確度及維修記錄得到提升後，就能加快完成所需的維修工程，提升維修效率。現時，RDDS已被納入為道路巡查的標準作業程序作恆常使用。在全面採用RDDS後，承建商從完成道路檢測工作至提交有關的道路檢測報告所需的時間平均由48小時大幅縮短至24小時內。為了進一步提升道路維修的工作效率，路政署將會擴展RDDS人工智能系統的分析能力，以識別更多不同類型的道路欠妥狀況，例如路面上生長過剩的雜草和褪色／受遮擋／彎曲的交通路牌等。

激光掃描路面三維影像的路面狀況評估系統（Road Condition Assessment System, RCAS）利用配備激光掃描設備及全球衛星定位技術的檢測車以正常車速在行車路上行駛，能自動識別並準確記錄路面上各種類型的缺陷，例如坑洞、車轍等，並計算出每100米行車道的路面狀況指數供負責維修的工程人員參考，決定該段路是否優先需要進行重建或重鋪工程。相對過去需要靠巡路員作封路安排後在路面上目測及量度，每天最多只能檢測數百米的行車道的速度，RCAS能在無須進行封路的情況下讓負責維修的同事更全面掌握所有路面的最新狀況，更有效地運用資源進行規劃道路維修工作，亦能避免對交通造成影響。

路政署期望利用RCAS在香港所有主要路段作檢測後，能更有效地運用資源去選擇路面狀況較差的路段以進行道路維修工作。RCAS現在仍處於試驗階段，每天能檢測約200公里的行車道，期望於一年的試用階段中能為香港所有的主要路段作檢測，並透過收集相關數據以建立有關的網絡維修平台供工程人員使用。

由於RCAS仍然處於試驗階段，技術的成本效益仍在評估當中。但根據初步估算，引入RCAS能釋放承建商巡路隊約四分之一的人手以應付日益增加的道路維修工作。

（四）路政署自二○二四年起透過道路維修保養合約，聘請不同服務承辦商參與研發RCAS，用以精確地記錄路面的起伏，並找出坑洞等路面缺損情況，協助計劃道路維修保養的工作。上述研發項目大致分為三個階段：在第一階段，服務承辦商需要購置車輛，並於車輛安裝雷射掃描及定位裝置；在第二階段，服務承辦商需開發人工智能及幾何分析算法系統，以自動偵測路面缺損並評核路面狀況，以及建立地理信息系統網絡平台發放相關資料；在第三階段，服務承辦商需利用系統掃描全港路面及自動評估路面狀況，同時將評估結果上傳到地理信息系統網絡平台。現時第一及第二階段已完成，第三階段工作亦已展開，預計今年內完成。路政署正評估整個智慧道路分析系統的成效，亦會適時考慮將該項技術納入為日後道路巡查的標準作業程序。

現時，RDDS應用於快速識別路面裂縫及褪色路面標記，方便維修人員找出欠妥位置及加快完成所需的維修工程，從而提升維修效率。RCAS則專注於精準識別並準確記錄路面上各種類型的缺陷及其破損程度，並計算出每100米行車道的路面狀況指數，有助負責維修的工程人員決定該段路是否需要優先進行路面重鋪工程。鑑於RDDS和RCAS的功能不同，偵測路況的速度和準確度有別，所以應用的定位也不同，現階段兩個系統將會雙軌並行。然而，路政署會繼續研發RDDS及RCAS的功能，並不排除在將來當兩個系統的功能、速度和準確度相若時將其合併。

（五）按現行《小型無人機令》要求，控制小型無人機的「機手」在一般標準操作下，需與小型無人機保持目視距離。路政署的「監管沙盒」項目利用超視距技術，配合4G／5G指揮與控制鏈路，讓小型無人機可以更安全及穩定地在「機手」視線範圍之外飛行，距離可達數公里，可更靈活應用在緊急情況如山泥傾瀉及常規操作下對道路基礎設施及主要幹線進行的測量和巡查。

在緊急情況下，透過採用超視距無人機技術，小型無人機能迅速到達偏遠的山泥傾瀉事故現場，並透過所拍攝的航空照片計算出斜坡的三維模型，有利工程人員準確地量度山泥面積及體積，以支援斜坡復修工作；另外，在極端天氣下，小型無人機亦能沿指定預設路線飛行，有助迅速查看主要公路上是否有水浸、倒樹或其他障礙物倒路。就日常的測量和巡查而言，超視距無人機技術可協助於跨海大橋、密閉空間以及工程人員比較難到達及目視的架空結構等地方進行檢測，能恆常應用於橋樑結構表面欠妥檢查、斜坡修復等常規作業。

該「監管沙盒」項目分階段在不同場景進行試飛，地點分別為大埔海濱碼頭至三門仔、將軍澳隧道公路、將軍澳跨灣大橋、大老山公路和鴨脷洲大橋，模擬為上述地點沿路的斜坡和相關的主要幹線進行超視距巡查，飛行距離約為200米至2 000米不等。其中，路政署已完成首兩個測試地點的試飛，餘下三個亦預期將於二○二五年九月底前分階段完成。"
LCQ8: Non-elderly one-person applicants waiting for public rental housing,2025-06-18 12:47,2025-06-18 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800355.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kwok Wai-keung and a written reply by the Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

  I have contacted a group of grass-roots households in recent months, several of whom are young people who have been waiting for public rental housing (PRH) under the Harmonious Families Priority Scheme for years. Unfortunately, their family members passed away before they were allocated PRH, leaving them to continue waiting for PRH as ""non-elderly one-person applicants"". In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1)of, in each year between 2022 and 2024, (i) the number of score points that non-elderly one-person applicants needed to obtain to be arranged for detailed vetting (commonly known as ""being interviewed by an officer""), (ii) the respective ages of the oldest and the youngest non-elderly one-person applicants at the time when they were allocated PRH, and (iii) the quota of PRH units for allocation to non-elderly one-person applicants and its share in the total number of PRH units supplied for that year;

(2)as the 2024 Policy Address has proposed that the total public housing supply from 2025-2026 to 2029-2030 will reach 189 000 units, which is about 80 per cent higher than that of the first five-year period since the current-term Government took office (i.e. 2022-2023 to 2026-2027), and in the past two years, the average waiting time for PRH dropped from the peak of 6.1 years to the current 5.5 years, whether the Government has plans to increase the quota of PRH units reserved for non-elderly one-person applicants; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3)to enable non-elderly one-person applicants to consider whether they should continue waiting for PRH, whether the Government can provide them with more information on the Points System in a timely manner, such as by dividing the non-elderly one-person applicants into 10 groups evenly according to their score points and publishing the highest and lowest score points of applicants in each group, so that the applicants will know which group they are in and their waiting status, thereby helping them to assess their waiting time?

Reply:

President,

  The objective of the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) is to provide public rental housing (PRH) to people who cannot afford private rental accommodation. It is the policy of the HA to accord priority to general applicants (i.e. family applicants and elderly-one person applicants) over non-elderly one-person applicants in the allocation of PRH flats. The reply to the Hon Kwok Wai-keung's question is as follows:

(1) From 2022/23 to 2024/25, the points for non-elderly one person applicants arranged for detailed vetting, the highest and lowest ages of non-elderly one-person applicants that were housed to PRH flats and the ratio of actual allocation for non-elderly one-person applicants to the actual annual allocation are set out in Tables 1 to 3 of the Annex respectively.

(2) In order to rationalise and prioritise the allocation of PRH to non-elderly one-person applicants, the HA implemented the Quota and Points System (QPS) since September 2005. Unlike general applicants, the priority of flat allocation to non-elderly one-person applicants is not determined by the time when the individual applicant joined the queue, but the total points accumulated by an individual applicant under QPS. The points are calculated based on the applicants' age, their waiting time and whether they are already residing in PRH.

  The HA endorsed refining QPS in October 2014. Such refinements included increasing the scale of age points from three to nine points per year of age increase at the time of application to reduce the incentive for early registration; and awarding a one-off bonus of 60 points to non-elderly one-person applicants aged 45 or above so as to accord them with higher priority over other younger applicants. In addition, starting from 2015/16, the HA has also increased the annual allocation quota for non-elderly one-person applicants under QPS from 8 per cent to 10 per cent of the total number of units to be allocated to PRH applicants, subject to a cap which was increased from 2 000 to 2 200 units. Generally speaking, elder applicants will be allocated flats faster under the refined QPS. The above arrangement of increasing the cap of allocation quota has struck an appropriate balance between the needs of non-elderly one-person applicants and that of general applicants. Considering that the demand for PRH in the society remains strong currently, we have no plan to further increase the annual allocation quota for QPS at this stage.

  We do not encourage young people to apply for PRH early. Young people should seize their time and work hard to move up the housing ladder in accordance with their abilities. In fact, the number of non-elderly one-person applicants reduced significantly by about 40 per cent from the highest level of 143 700 as at end-December 2015 to 86 300 as at end-March 2025. During the same period, the number of non-elderly one-person applicants aged below 30 recorded a sharper decline of 57 per cent, from 74 500 to 31 700.

  The Government has been encouraging young people to buy their own homes through the provision of various types of subsidised sale flats (SSF). In fact, young people aged below 40 have always accounted for a large proportion of buyers of different types of SSF. For example, nearly half of the successful applicants for first-hand Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats are young people under the age of 40; meanwhile, around 80 per cent of the buyers of White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) are under the age of 40.

  In the next five years (i.e. from 2025/26 to 2029/30), apart from PRH/ Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme flats, the HA and the Hong Kong Housing Society will have a supply of about 56 500 SSF. To increase the chances of young people in purchasing SSF successfully, the HA will allocate an extra ballot number to young family applicants and one-person applicants aged below 40 with white form status for the purchase of HOS flats starting from the next HOS sale exercise onwards; for the secondary market, starting from WSM 2024, the HA has also increased the quota by 1 500 to 6 000, all of which will be allocated to young family applicants and one-person applicants aged below 40.
 
(3) The priority under QPS is determined by the total points accumulated by an non-elderly one-person applicant. To enhance the transparency of information, the Housing Department (HD) publishes the latest PRH allocation status in different districts in newspapers on a monthly basis, including the lowest point for non-elderly one person applicants being arranged for detailed vetting and the lowest point for non-elderly one person applicants having accepted public housing offers in individual application district. Such information is also uploaded to the HA/HD website (www.housingauthority.gov.hk/en/flat-application/allocation-status/index.html) for applicants' reference.

  In addition, ""e-Services for PRH Application"" (eservices.housingauthority.gov.hk/eprhas) also provides 24-hour online services for PRH applicants. Through ""iAM Smart+"", applicants can submit their PRH applications, enquire about their application status, amend the application information, and change the date and time of the detailed vetting interview, etc."
立法會八題：非長者一人申請者輪候公共租住房屋,2025-06-18 12:47,2025-06-18 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800331.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上郭偉强議員的提問和房屋局局長何永賢的書面答覆：

問題：

本人近月曾接觸一批基層住戶，當中有數名青年原本在「天倫樂」優先配屋計劃下輪候公共租住房屋（公屋）多年，可惜其家人在獲編配公屋前便離世，令他們只能以「非長者一人申請者」的身分繼續輪候公屋。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）在二○二二年至二○二四年期間，每年（i）非長者一人申請者獲安排詳細資格審查（俗稱「見主任」）的分數、（ii）非長者一人申請者獲安排入住公屋時的最高及最低年齡，以及（iii）編配予非長者一人申請者的單位配額數量及其佔當年公屋單位總供應量的比例分別為何；

（二）鑑於《2024年施政報告》提出，二○二五／二○二六年度至二○二九／二○三○年度總體公營房屋供應量將達189 000伙，較本屆政府上任時的五年期（即二○二二／二○二三年度至二○二六／二○二七年度）增加約80%，而在過去兩年，公屋平均輪候時間已由高峰6.1年回落至5年半，政府有否計劃增加和預留公屋單位配額予非長者一人申請者；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）為了讓非長者一人申請者考慮應否持續輪候公屋，政府可否適時地向他們提供更多關於計分制的資訊，例如按照分數高低將非長者一人申請者平均劃分為10‍個組別，並公布每個組別申請者的最高及最低分數，讓非長者一人申請者知悉自己的所處組別及輪候狀況，從而協助他們評估輪候時間？

答覆:

主席：

香港房屋委員會（房委會）的宗旨是為不能負擔租住私人樓宇的人士提供公共租住房屋（公屋）。按房委會的政策，在編配公屋單位時，一般申請者（即家庭申請者及長者一人申請者）會較非長者一人申請者優先得到照顧。就郭偉强議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）二○二二／二三至二○二四／二五年度，非長者一人申請者獲安排詳細資格審查的分數、非長者一人申請者獲安排入住公屋單位時的最高及最低年齡及非長者一人申請者佔年度實際編配的比例分別載於附件表一至表三。

（二）為了理順及訂定編配公屋予非長者一人申請者的優先次序，房委會於二○○五年九月起實施「配額及計分制」。有別於一般申請者，非長者一人申請者獲編配公屋的優先次序，並非按個別申請者加入隊伍的時間，而是取決於他在「配額及計分制」下所累積的總分數。有關分數視乎申請者的年齡、輪候時間以及是否已居於公屋而定。

房委會在二○一四年十月通過修訂「配額及計分制」，當中包括增加年齡分數，把申請時年齡每增添一歲可得的分數，由三分增加至九分，以減低盡早申請的誘因；以及給予年屆45歲的非長者一人申請者一次性額外60分，使他們的優先次序高於其他較年輕的申請者。此外，房委會亦由二○一五／一六年度起增加「配額及計分制」下非長者一人申請者的配額，由每年佔擬編配予公屋申請者單位總數的8%增加至10%，單位上限從2 000個增加至2 200個。經修訂的「配額及計分制」下，一般而言，較年長人士會較快獲得編配單位。以上增加配額單位上限的安排，已在非長者一人申請者和一般申請者的需求之間取得適當的平衡。考慮到目前社會對公屋需求仍然十分殷切，我們現階段並沒有計劃再增加「配額及計分制」下的配額。

我們並不鼓勵年青人盡早申請公屋。年青人應把握時光，努力工作，從而按自己的能力選擇合適的房屋階梯上流。事實上，非長者一人申請者的數目已由二○一五年十二月底最高位的143 700宗大幅下跌近40%至二○二五年三月底的86 300宗。同一期間，年齡為30歲以下的非長者一人申請的跌幅更為明顯，由74 500宗下跌57%至31 700宗。

政府一直透過提供不同種類的資助出售單位，鼓勵青年置業。事實上，在各資助出售單位的買家中，40歲以下青年一直佔較大比例。舉例而言，成功購買一手居者有其屋計劃（居屋）單位的申請者有近一半是40歲以下青年；另外，約80%的「白表居屋第二市場計劃」（白居二）買家是40歲以下。

在未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），除了公屋／綠表置居計劃單位外，房委會和香港房屋協會將會有約56 500個資助出售單位的供應。為增加青年成功購買資助出售單位的機會，房委會會由下一期居屋起為40歲以下申請購買居屋單位的白表青年家庭及一人申請者分派多一個抽籤號碼；而在第二市場方面，房委會亦已由「白居二2024」起，增加1 500個配額至6 000個，並將新增配額全數撥予40歲以下的青年家庭及一人申請者。

（三）「配額及計分制」下的優次是取決於非長者一人申請者在計分制下所累積的總分數。為增加資訊透明度，房屋署會每月於報章刊登各分區最新的公屋編配進度，包括非長者一人申請者正獲安排詳細資格審查的申請之最低分數，以及個別申請地區內已接受配房的最低分數，並將有關資料上載至房委會／房屋署網頁（www.housingauthority.gov.hk/tc/flat-application/allocation-status/index.html），供申請者參考。

此外，「公屋申請電子服務」（eservices.housingauthority.gov.hk/eprhas）亦提供24小時網上服務，讓公屋申請者透過「智方便+」遞交公屋申請表、查詢目前申請進度、更改申請資料或詳細資格審查面晤的日期和時間等。"
LCQ2: Child allowance,2025-06-18 12:40,2025-06-18 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800340.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Nixie Lam and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

 Under the Inland Revenue Ordinance, all eligible child allowances for married couples residing together can only be claimed by one of them, and they must decide on their own who should make the claims. There are views that such arrangement may give rise to disputes within the family. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that modern married couples usually share the responsibility of taking care of their children (both financially and in terms of care), of the reasons why child allowances can only be claimed by one of them at present;

(2) whether it has studied amending the legislation to stipulate that married couples with children may allocate child allowances equally or claim child allowances separately; if so, of the specific plan and timetable, including whether it will consider introducing a default allocation mechanism (such as allowing a choice of equal allocation of allowances or automatic allocation of allowances according to the ratio of the married couples' incomes, empowering the Inland Revenue Department to make rulings or setting clear criteria on the priority of making claims); if it has not studied amending the legislation, of the reasons for that; and

(3) whether, in the absence of legislative amendments at present, the Government will consider drawing up a set of reference guidelines on child allowances, e.g. the order of claims may be handled according to the ratio of family incomes, major child-rearing roles or previous claiming practices, etc, as well as stepping up public education, so as to assist families in making proper arrangements for claiming allowances; if so, of the specific plan and timetable; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 According to Section 31 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112) (Ordinance), a taxpayer for salaries tax may claim child allowance for a year of assessment if he/she maintains an unmarried child who is under 18 years old; of or over 18 but under 25 years old and receiving full time education at an educational institution; or of or over 18 years old and is, because of physical or mental disability, unable to work in that year of assessment. A taxpayer may claim child allowance for up to nine children. Starting from the year of assessment 2023/24, the allowance for each child is $130,000. An additional allowance of $130,000 is granted for a newborn child during the year of assessment of the child's birth.

 My reply to parts 1-3 of the Hon Nixie Lam's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) According to Section 31(3) of the Ordinance, unless a taxpayer and his/her spouse are living apart, all child allowances must be claimed en bloc by either the taxpayer or his/her spouse. Taxpayers and their spouse should jointly decide who will claim all the child allowances. This requirement was included in the Ordinance in 1989, when married persons started to be allowed to elect separate taxation or joint assessment with their spouse, and has been in force until today. The main considerations are as follows:

 Before the year of assessment 2003/04, the amount of child allowance was determined by the number of children claimed on a regressive basis. Starting from the year of assessment 2003/04, the 1st to the 9th child are granted with a uniform allowance. Nevertheless, the prevailing mechanism already provides sufficient options and flexibility to reduce the tax burden on married persons, and more than 60 per cent of taxpayers claiming child allowances claim for only one child. We therefore consider that there is no need to abolish the requirement that only a taxpayer or his/her spouse can claim child allowance. Currently, married persons may elect separate taxation or joint assessment with their spouse for tax savings. Having all child allowances claimed by one party or allowing both parties to separately claim allowances for individual child or children does not affect the total amount of tax payable under joint assessment. Under the current arrangement, even if married persons and their spouse do not elect joint assessment on their own initiative, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) would still compare their tax payable under separate taxation and joint assessment. If joint assessment is found to be more beneficial to them, the IRD would invite them to elect joint assessment. In addition, the Ordinance does not require that the allowance in respect of the same child must always be claimed by the same claimant. If taxpayers and their spouse choose separate taxation, they may discuss in advance on how to claim the child allowance and flexibly arrange to claim the child allowance for different years of assessment, such as taking turns to claim in different years, to meet the needs of individual families.

 We find the current mechanism effective in reducing the tax burden on married persons and providing taxpayers with a flexible and convenient tax filing process, allowing them to make appropriate tax arrangements according to their family situations. There is no need to allow taxpayers and their spouse to separately claim child allowances. Currently, the IRD only apportions the child allowance based on actual circumstances for living apart or divorced cases. This arrangement helps reduce the compliance burden on taxpayers and ensure the IRD's efficiency of tax assessment.

 On the other hand, as the specific circumstances and needs of each family vary, taxpayers and their spouse may have different financial and tax arrangements. We have no plans to change the current practice of the IRD generally not intervening in family matters to introduce a default allocation mechanism, as it is unlikely to meet the needs of all families.

The Government will continue to review the claim arrangements and levels of various allowances from time to time, and consider whether there is room for enhancement based on various factors such as the number of beneficiaries, the Government's financial situation, and administrative efficiency.

(3) The IRD currently provides frequently asked questions and guidelines on child allowances on its website. Generally speaking, it is more beneficial for the party with higher income to claim child allowance. However, if one party is assessed at standard rates, it would be more beneficial for the other party who is not assessed at standard rates to claim the allowance. The website also features a tax calculator, allowing taxpayers and their spouses to input their respective income amounts, deductions, and different allowance distribution scenarios to make the most appropriate claim arrangements. Besides, after issuing individual tax returns in May of each year, the IRD will extend the service hours of telephone enquiry to answer questions from taxpayers about completing their tax returns.

Thank you, Mr President."
立法會二題：子女免稅額,2025-06-18 12:40,2025-06-18 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800335.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上林琳議員的提問和署理財經事務及庫務局局長陳浩濂的答覆：

問題：

根據《稅務條例》，同住夫婦的所有合資格子女免稅額，只可由其中一方申索，而他們須自行決定由誰人提出申索。有意見認為，有關安排或令家庭內部出現爭拗。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於現代夫婦通常共同承擔照顧子女的責任（包括在經濟及照顧上），現時只可由其中一方申索子女免稅額的原因為何；

（二）有否研究修訂法例，訂明育有子女的夫婦，可平均分配或各自申索子女免稅額；如有，具體計劃及時間表為何，包括會否考慮引入預設分配機制（例如可選擇平均分配或按夫妻收入比例自動分配免稅額、賦予稅務局裁定權限，或就申索優先次序訂立明確準則）；如未有研究修例，原因為何；及

（三）在現時未有修例的情況下，政府會否考慮制訂一套子女免稅額的參考指引，例如申索次序可按家庭收入比例、主要撫養角色或過往申索慣例等處理，並加強公眾教育，以協助家庭妥善安排免稅額申索；如會，具體計劃及時間表為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

根據《稅務條例》（第112章）（《條例》）第31條，薪俸稅納稅人如供養未婚子女，而子女在課稅年度未滿18歲；或年滿18歲但未滿25歲，並在教育機構接受全日制教育；或年滿18歲，但因身體或精神問題無能力工作，則納稅人可以在有關課稅年度申索子女免稅額。納稅人最多可就九名子女申索免稅額。由二○二三／二四課稅年度起，每名子女的免稅額為130,000元，在每名新生子女出生的課稅年度，其免稅額可獲額外增加130,000元。

就林琳議員的問題第（一）至（三）部分，現答覆如下：

（一）及（二）根據《條例》第31（3）條，除非納稅人與其配偶分開居住，否則全部子女免稅額須由納稅人或其配偶其中一方申索，納稅人及其配偶須共同決定由哪一方提出所有申索。這項規定於一九八九年開始容許已婚人士選擇與配偶分開評稅或合併評稅時納入《條例》，並一直有效沿用至今，主要的考量如下：

在二○○三／○四課稅年度之前，子女免稅額會按申報的子女數目以累退制訂定，由二○○三／○四課稅年度起，第一至九名子女均可享有劃一免稅額。儘管如此，現行機制已提供足夠選項及彈性減輕夫婦的稅務負擔，加上超過六成申索子女免稅額的納稅人只就一名子女申索免稅額，我們認為無需要取消只可以由納稅人或其配偶其中一方申索子女免稅額的規定。現時，已婚人士可選擇與配偶分開評稅或合併評稅，從而節省稅款。由其中一方申索全部子女免稅額或允許雙方分開申索個別子女的免稅額，並不影響合併評稅下須繳交的稅款總額。在現行安排下，即使已婚人士及其配偶沒有主動選擇合併評稅，稅務局仍會比較二人分開評稅及合併評稅的應繳稅款。如果發現合併評稅對他們更有利，稅務局將邀請他們選擇合併評稅。此外，《條例》並無規定同一名子女的免稅額必須一直由相同的申索人申請。如納稅人及其配偶選擇分開評稅，他們可事先協商子女免稅額的申索方式，靈活地自行安排在不同課稅年度申索子女免稅額，例如輪流在不同年度申索，以符合個別家庭需要。

我們認為現行的機制行之有效，既可減輕夫婦的稅務負擔，亦為納稅人提供靈活便捷的報稅流程，讓他們可因應家庭情況作出合適的稅務安排，無需容許納稅人及其配偶分開申索子女免稅額。稅務局現時只會在夫婦分居或離婚的情況下按實際情況分攤子女免稅額。這安排有助減低納稅人的合規負擔和確保稅務局的評稅效率。

另一方面，因應每個家庭的具體情況和需要不盡相同，納稅人及其配偶可能有不同的財政及稅務安排。我們無計劃改變稅務局一般不會介入家庭事務的做法，引入預設分配機制，因為這不可能符合所有家庭的需要。

政府會繼續不時檢視各項免稅額的申索安排和水平，並因應受惠人數、政府的財政狀況和行政效率等多項因素，以考慮是否有優化的空間。

（三）稅務局現時已於其網頁提供有關子女免稅額的常見問題及參考指引。一般而言，由入息較高的一方申索子女免稅額會更有利。不過，如其中一方是以標準稅率評稅，則會由並非以標準稅率評稅的另一方申索會更為有利。網頁亦設有稅款計算機，方便納稅人及配偶輸入各自的入息款額、扣除及不同的免稅額分配情況等，以作出最合適的申索安排。此外，稅務局於每年五月發出個別人士報稅表後，會延長電話查詢服務時間，解答納稅人在填寫報稅表時遇到的問題。

多謝主席。"
LCQ3: Prevention of elderly suicide,2025-06-18 12:30,2025-06-18 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800295.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Tik Chi-yuen and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

  Regarding the prevention of elderly suicide, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled detailed statistics on elderly suicide over the past five years, including but not limited to the annual number of suicide cases, the comparison of suicide rates between persons aged above 60 and other age groups, the gender, age and geographical distribution of elderly suicide victims, and the proportion of cases involving mental health issues; whether it has conducted in-depth study on the issue of elderly suicide in Hong Kong; if so, of the main triggering factors for suicide and their respective proportions, as well as the characteristics of high-risk groups; if not, the reasons for that;

(2)what specific measures are currently in place to address the mental health of the elderly and prevent suicide, particularly tailor-made support measures for high-risk elderly persons, and the allocation of resources concerned; whether it has assessed the effectiveness of such measures; if so, of the details; and

(3) given that some members of the social welfare sector have suggested that the Government should establish a ""register of high-risk singleton and doubleton elderly households"", whether the Government will consider the suggestion; if so, of the details, including the frequency of updating the register, the support provided to the elderly on the register, and whether the Government will share data with, among others, the Hospital Authority and non-governmental organisations to collaborate in supporting the elderly persons concerned?

Reply:

President,

  Elderly suicide is a multi-factorial issue with no single main cause, such as emotional problems, personal health and family relationships. In consultation with the Health Bureau, the Hospital Authority (HA), the Department of Health (DH) and the Social Welfare Department (SWD), the consolidated reply to the Member's question as follows:

  The Coroners Ordinance (Cap. 504) sets out 20 categories of deaths which should be reported to the Coroner, including suicide cases. Relevant statistics related to elderly suicide cases from 2020 to 2024 are at the Annex. Figures show that the number of suicide deaths of persons aged 60 or above has remained by and large steady in recent years, with a slight decrease in the proportion of all cases.

  While the Government has not conducted any specific study on the subject of elderly suicide in recent years, the Government all along attaches great importance to the mental health of elderly persons, and has rolled out various measures to improve the psychological health of elderly persons and prevent elderly suicide. For instance, the DH's Elderly Health Centres (EHCs) provide health assessment for their elderly members, including early detection and prevention of elderly suicide through the use of an internationally recognised screening tool for local elderly people that targets the symptoms of depression (including suicidal ideation). Healthcare professionals of the EHCs will refer cases with depression and suicidal risk to the accident and emergency departments for immediate handling.

Apart from the DH, the HA has implemented the Elderly Suicide Prevention Programme (ESPP) since 2002 to provide timely and appropriate psychiatric diagnosis and treatments for elderly people suspected to have suicidal tendency, with a view to reducing the suicidal risk of the elderly concerned. Under the ESPP, an elderly person assessed to have suicidal risk by doctors or social workers will be referred to the HA's psychiatric services for early further follow-up, diagnosis and suitable treatment.

  In addition, the HA and the SWD, through medical-social collaboration of seven HA clusters and 41 District Elderly Community Centres, implement the Dementia Community Support Scheme to enhance healthcare support at the community level. Elderly persons with mild or moderate dementia are provided with suitable support services in the community so as to stabilise their conditions and alleviate their distress in going in and out of the hospitals, and their carers also receive relevant support. The Government's ""18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline"" offers one-stop, round-the-clock support, including immediate mental health support and referral services, for people with mental health needs (including the elderly).

  On the other hand, the SWD identifies and supports elderly persons with emotional distress and/or suicidal risks through a wide range of services. On mainstream services, there are 214 subvented elderly centres in Hong Kong providing services such as care visits, emotional support and counselling for elderly persons and their carers. The 65 Integrated Family Service Centres and two Integrated Services Centres across the territory provide preventive, supportive and remedial services to families in need. The 58 Medical Social Services Units in hospitals and clinics also offer counselling and support services, where social workers will assess the suicide risk of the service recipients when handling the cases. Besides, the SWD provides subvention to commission non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to operate 24 Integrated Community Centres for Mental Wellness territory-wide with one-stop, district-based community support services ranging from prevention to crisis management. In terms of specialised services, the SWD has been subventing the Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong to operate the Suicide Crisis Intervention Centre, providing outreaching, crisis intervention and intensive counselling services for people with moderate or high suicide risk. Apart from the SWD's services, the NGO Suicide Prevention Services, with funding support from the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust, has launched the Outreach Befriending Service for the Suicidal Elderly since 2006 to early identify elderly persons suffering from emotional disturbances or with suicide risk through outreaching. Furthermore, dedicated hotline services are operated by the SWD and subvented NGOs to help persons in emotional distress (including those with suicidal tendency). Such hotline services encourage and refer the clients to relevant service units to receive in-depth counselling services that suit their needs. Among them, professional social workers of the round-the-clock Designated Hotline for Carer Support 182 183 provide immediate consultation and counselling, outreaching, emergency support and referral services, etc, for carers in need (including aged carers).

  The 2024 Policy Address announced that the Government is exploring the setting up of an inter-disciplinary and inter-organisation database on carers of elderly persons and persons with disabilities. The Government is studying the integration of data related to social welfare services scattered across different departments and organisations, with a view to building a data platform to promote inter-departmental collaboration as well as service innovation, and enhance service efficiency through sharing and analysis of data. The aim is to identify and encourage high-risk cases to receive support, intervene immediately for cases with sudden increase in risks under automatic monitoring (e.g. carers admitted to hospitals), strengthen the mechanism for medical-social collaboration, develop tailor-made support programmes, optimise allocation of resources and services, etc. The database on carers will initially include information on carers of elderly persons and low-income carers from the SWD, Care Teams and the Housing Department. As the purposes for which data are collected by different organisations may not necessarily include providing social welfare support services for the persons concerned, the Government is discussing with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data and relevant departments how to design data-sharing solutions, with a view to launching a pilot scheme in compliance with the requirements of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance."
立法會三題：預防長者自殺,2025-06-18 12:30,2025-06-18 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800289.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上狄志遠議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的答覆：

問題：

關於預防長者自殺，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計，過去五年關於長者自殺的詳細數據，包括但不限於每年自殺宗數、60歲以上人士與其他年齡層人士自殺率的比較、自殺長者的性別、年齡及地區分布，以及涉及精神健康問題的個案比例；有否深入研究香港長者自殺的問題；如有，主要的自殺誘因及所佔比例，以及高危群體的特徵為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）目前有哪些針對長者心理健康及預防其自殺的具體措施，尤其針對高危長者的專門支援措施，以及有關的資源分配情況為何；有否評估該等措施的成效；如有，詳情為何；及

（三）鑑於有社福界人士建議，政府應設立「獨居長者及雙老家庭高危名冊」，政府會否考慮有關建議；如會，詳情為何，包括名冊的更新頻率、對名冊內長者所提供的支援，以及政府會否與醫院管理局及非政府組織等共享數據，以合作支援有關長者？

答覆：

主席：

長者自殺涉及多項因素，並無單一主要原因，例如情緒問題、個人健康及家庭關係等。就議員的提問，經諮詢醫務衞生局、醫院管理局（醫管局）、衞生署和社會福利署（社署），現綜合回覆如下：

依照《死因裁判官條例》（香港法例第504章），共有20類死亡個案須向死因裁判官報告，包括自殺身亡的個案。二○二○年至二○二四年長者自殺個案的相關數據載於附件。數字顯示近年60歲或以上人士自殺身亡的個案數字大致平穩，在所有個案中的佔比略有下降。

政府近年並未就長者自殺的課題進行特定研究，但一直十分重視長者的精神健康，並推行不同措施，改善長者心理健康和防止長者自殺。舉例來說，衞生署長者健康中心為長者會員提供健康評估，包括以國際認可適用於本地長者並針對抑鬱症狀（包括自殺念頭）的健康篩查工具，及早偵測及預防長者自殺。長者健康中心的醫護人員遇有抑鬱和自殺風險的個案，會轉介至急症室即時處理。

除衞生署外，醫管局針對有自殺風險的長者，自二○○二年起推行防止長者自殺計劃，為懷疑有自殺傾向的長者提供適時和適切的精神科診斷及治療，以減低有關長者的自殺風險。在計劃下，由醫生或社工評估為有自殺風險的長者會獲轉介醫管局精神科，及早作進一步跟進、診斷及合適的治理。

此外，醫管局及社署透過七個醫管局聯網及41個長者地區中心以「醫社合作」模式，推行「智友醫社同行計劃」，加強社區層面的護理服務元素，為患有輕度或中度認知障礙症的長者在社區內提供適切的支援服務，以穩定他們的病情及減輕他們進出醫院的困擾，並讓他們的照顧者得到相關的支援。政府的「情緒通」18111精神健康支援熱線亦每日24小時向受情緒困擾的人士（包括長者）提供一站式支援服務，包括即時的精神健康支援及轉介服務。

另一方面，社署提供多元化的服務，識別及支援有情緒困擾及／或有自殺危機的長者。在主流服務方面，全港214個資助長者中心為長者及其照顧者提供關懷探訪、情緒支持及輔導等服務。全港65個綜合家庭服務中心和兩個綜合服務中心為有需要的家庭提供預防、支援和補救性服務。全港58個設於醫院及診所的醫務社會服務部亦提供輔導及支援服務，社工在處理個案時會評估受助人的自殺風險。此外，社署提供資助，委聘非政府機構在全港營辦24個精神健康綜合社區中心，提供由預防以至危機管理的一站式、以地區為本的社區支援服務。在專門服務方面，社署資助香港撒瑪利亞防止自殺會營運自殺危機處理中心，為有中度／高度自殺風險的人士提供外展、危機介入、深入輔導等服務。除社署的服務外，非政府機構生命熱線自二○○六年起獲香港賽馬會慈善信託基金資助，開展「生命共行－外展長者服務」，以外展形式及早識別受情緒困擾或有自殺風險的長者。此外，社署亦營運及資助非政府機構為受情緒困擾人士（包括有自殺傾向人士）提供熱線服務，因應受助人的需要，鼓勵及轉介他們到相關服務單位接受深入輔導服務。其中，24小時運作的照顧者支援專線182 183由專業社工為有需要的照顧者（包括年長的照顧者）提供即時諮詢和輔導、外展、緊急支援及轉介等服務。

二○二四年《施政報告》宣布，政府會研究建立跨專業、跨機構的護老者和殘疾人士照顧者資料庫。政府正研究整合分散在不同部門、機構的社福服務相關數據資料，以構建數據平台，通過共享與分析數據，推動跨部門協作和服務創新，提高服務效率，以識別及鼓勵高風險個案接受支援、即時介入自動化監測風險突然轉高的個案（例如照顧者入院）、加強醫社協作機制、開發針對性的支援計劃、優化資源分配及服務等。照顧者資料庫初步會包括來自社署、關愛隊、房屋署關於年老照顧者及低收入照顧者的資料。由於不同機構收集資料的用途未必包括為相關人士提供社福支援服務，政府正與個人資料私隱專員公署及相關部門商討如何設計數據分享方案，以便在符合《個人資料（私隱）條例》的要求下，展開相關的試點計劃。"

問題：

據報，近日不同執法部門發現有非法勞工利用網約車或網上外賣平台從事司機或食物外送員工作，並採取執法行動。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，有多少名非法勞工及僱用非法勞工的僱主被檢控，並按季度列出分項數字；

（二）鑑於據悉，經數碼平台從事工作並不涉及工作面試等僱傭程序，當局有否評估，該等平台的活動是否較容易涉及非法勞工；有否發現，是否有不法集團專門收購一些香港居民的個人身分資料，以註冊該等平台的工作帳戶，再透過僱用非法勞工使用該等帳戶提供服務牟利；如有，詳情為何；

（三）當局有否與該等數碼平台接觸，以了解其運作是否出現漏洞而令不法集團及非法勞工可從中得益；如有，詳情為何；及

（四）有否研究立法加強打擊利用該等數碼平台工作以獲取報酬的非法勞工？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直致力打擊非法勞工，從而保障本地勞工的就業機會。從事非法工作屬嚴重罪行，僱主和非法勞工以及協助和教唆他人從事非法工作的人士均會根據《入境條例》被檢控。《入境條例》載有不同條文針對不同人士的相關犯罪行為。訪客、非法入境者及免遣返聲請人等均不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務，協助及教唆者與非法勞工同罪。此外，政府於二○二一年修訂《入境條例》，增加了對僱主僱用非法勞工的刑罰，最高刑罰由原來的罰款35萬元和監禁三年大幅提高至罰款50萬元和監禁10年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

就黃俊碩議員的提問，經諮詢勞工及福利局／勞工處、香港警務處（警務處）及入境事務處（入境處），現回覆如下：

（二）非法勞工的情況不限於個別行業。政府一直大力打擊非法勞工，並嚴厲執法。近年市民對網上平台服務的需求有所增加（包括網上外賣及網約車服務），相關執法機關已採取相應行動以打擊非法勞工，有需要時更會展開聯合行動。就網上外賣平台方面，入境處及警務處於二○二四至二○二五年五月進行的相關執法行動中共拘捕180人，其中98名非華裔人士涉嫌非法從事外賣工作，54名本地居民涉嫌轉售或租借其外賣員平台帳戶供非法勞工使用，四人涉嫌聘用非法勞工，其餘人士因從事其他非法工作或行使虛假文書等而被捕。至於網約車方面，同期有四人涉嫌違反逗留條件而被警方拘捕。

入境處及警務處於上述行動中並無發現有集團專門透過收購香港居民的個人身分資料以註冊有關平台的工作帳戶，並以此僱用非法勞工獲利的情況。執法部門會繼續密切留意情況，不會掉以輕心。

（三）就網上外賣平台而言，入境處及警務處不時與平台公司保持溝通，並已要求平台加強戶口註冊及登錄的保安措施，包括增加驗證步驟、要求真實身分驗證等，以防止戶口持有人租借戶口予他人進行外賣工作。勞工處亦已成立包括平台公司、勞工團體及政府代表的聯絡小組，共同探討加強保障平台工作者的事宜，包括如何加強防止非法勞工從事平台送遞工作。至於網約車方面，政府一直透過不同渠道重申任何業務的營運必須守法。

（四）如前述，二○二一年修訂的《入境條例》增加了對僱主僱用非法勞工的刑罰，最高刑罰由原來的罰款35萬元和監禁三年大幅提高至罰款50萬元和監禁10年。不論是否涉及網上工作平台或其他工作模式，僱主同樣有法律責任確保僱員為合法受僱人士。政府會繼續從多方面積極打擊非法勞工，包括加強巡查及「網上巡邏」、嚴厲執法，並會加強教育宣傳，以提高市民的守法意識。

加強巡查嚴厲執法

為阻嚇僱主僱用非法勞工，勞工處的勞工督察日常巡查工作場所執行勞工法例時，會根據《入境條例》第IVB部賦予的權力，查核在工作場所內受僱僱員的身分證明文件，以及僱主備存的僱員紀錄。如發現懷疑非法受聘的勞工，會轉介相關執法部門跟進。

入境處的網絡罪案及法證調查小組，專責協助前線調查人員搜集數碼證據，加強調查案件和搜證的能力，以應對不法分子可能利用發展成熟的科技干犯入境罪行以及將來可能出現的複雜罪案。小組亦主動打擊與非法勞工有關的網絡罪案，持續進行「網上巡邏」，如發現有人利用網上社交平台或即時通訊軟件組織、安排、慫恿市民干犯聘用非法勞工等嚴重罪行，會果斷採取執法行動。

入境處及警務處會持續嚴厲打擊與非法勞工相關的罪行，並視乎行動需要、風險評估及其他考慮因素，靈活調配足夠人手，以情報主導執行打擊與非法勞工相關罪行的行動。

教育宣傳提高守法意識

為提高市民守法意識並讓僱主明白僱用非法勞工的嚴重後果，入境處不時派遣人員及宣傳車到非法勞工黑點，向僱主派發「切勿聘用非法勞工」的宣傳單張，提醒他們務必查閱求職者的香港身份證正本以核實其可否合法受僱。與此同時，入境處亦在不同社交媒體的官方帳號，積極公布最新的反非法勞工行動的執法成效並加強發放「聘用非法員工即屬違法」的信息。此外，入境處亦透過不同渠道向市民提供辨識合法受僱人士的資訊，例如入境處網頁、單張及舉辦講座等。"
LCQ10: Crackdown on illegal workers,2025-06-18 12:22,2025-06-18 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800281.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Edmund Wong and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

It has been reported that various law enforcement agencies have recently discovered illegal workers using online car hailing or delivery platforms to work as drivers or food delivery workers, and have taken enforcement actions against them. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the numbers of illegal workers and employers of illegal workers who were prosecuted in the past three years, together with a quarterly breakdown of such figures;

(2) as it is learnt that engaging in work through digital platforms does not involve employment procedures such as job interviews, whether the authorities have assessed if the activities on such platforms are more susceptible to involving illegal workers; whether it has found any criminal syndicate specialising in acquiring the personal data of some Hong Kong residents for the purpose of registering work accounts on such platforms and subsequently making profits by employing illegal workers to provide services with these accounts; if so, of the details;

(3) whether the authorities have contacted such digital platforms to ascertain if there are loopholes in their operations from which criminal syndicates and illegal workers may benefit; if so, of the details; and

(4) whether it has studied enacting legislation to step up the crackdown on illegal workers using such digital platforms to work for reward?

Reply:

President,

The Government is committed to combatting illegal employment, with a view to protecting job opportunities for the local workforce. It is a serious offence to engage in illegal employment. Employers, illegal workers as well as aiders and abettors of illegal employment will be liable to prosecution in accordance with the Immigration Ordinance (IO). The IO has different provisions targeting relevant offences committed by different groups of persons. Visitors, illegal immigrants and non-refoulement claimants, etc, are prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining in any business. Aiders and abettors as well as illegal workers are liable to the same penalties. In addition, the Government amended the IO in 2021 by increasing the penalty of employers of illegal workers, with the maximum penalty significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment with a view to reflecting the gravity of such offences. The directors, managers, secretaries, partners, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that employers of illegal workers should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

Regarding the question raised by the Hon Edmund Wong, having consulted the Labour and Welfare Bureau/Labour Department (LD), the Hong Kong Police Force (the Police) and the Immigration Department (ImmD), our reply is as follows:

(1) According to ImmD's record, the number of illegal workers prosecuted and the number of employers of illegal workers prosecuted over the past three years are tabulated below:

(2) Illegal employment is not limited to individual industries. The Government has all along combatted illegal employment and enforced the law vigorously. With an increased demand for the services provided by online platforms (including online food delivery and online car hailing) in recent years, the relevant law enforcement agencies have taken respective actions in combatting illegal employment and will conduct joint operations when necessary. Regarding the online food delivery platforms, the ImmD and the Police arrested 180 persons in relevant enforcement operations from 2024 to May 2025, 98 were non-ethnic Chinese persons suspected of working illegally as food delivery couriers, 54 were local residents suspected of selling or renting their food delivery courier accounts to the illegal workers, four were suspected of employing illegal workers and the remaining were arrested because of engaging in other illegal works or using false instruments, etc. Regarding online car hailing, four persons who were suspected of breach of condition of stay were arrested by the Police during the same period.

In the above operations, the ImmD and the Police did not identify any syndicate specialising in acquiring the personal data of Hong Kong residents for the purpose of registering work accounts on such platforms to make profits through employing illegal workers to provide services with those accounts. The law enforcement agencies will continue to closely monitor the situation and will not take this lightly.

(3) Regarding online food delivery platforms, the ImmD and the Police maintain communications with platform companies from time to time, and have already requested them to strengthen the security measures on account registration and logging in, including adding authentication steps, requesting authentication of true identity, etc, in order to prevent the account holders from renting their accounts to others for food delivery. The LD has also established a Liaison Group comprising representatives of platform companies, labour organisations and the Government to explore suitable proposals to enhance the protection for platform workers, including stepping up on prevention of illegal workers in food delivery services. Regarding online car hailing, the Government has all along emphasised through various channels that any business shall be operated in accordance with the law.

(4) As aforementioned, the IO was amended in 2021 by increasing the penalty of employers of illegal workers, with the maximum penalty significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment. Regardless of whether online working platform or other working mode is involved, employers share the same legal responsibility to ensure employees are lawfully employable persons. The Government will continue to actively combat illegal employment on various fronts, including stepping up inspections and ""cyber patrols"", taking rigourous law enforcement, and will also strengthen publicity and education, in order to raise the public's law-abiding awareness.

Stepping up inspections and rigourous law enforcement

To deter employers from employing illegal workers, labour inspectors of the LD will, through regular workplace inspections, check employees' proof of identity and employees records kept by employers under the power conferred by the Part IVB of the IO. Suspected illegal employment cases detected will be referred to relevant law enforcement agencies for follow-up.

The Cybercrime and Forensics Investigation Group (The Group) of the ImmD is dedicated to assisting frontline investigators in collecting digital evidence so as to strengthen the ability in case investigation and evidence collection, with a view to coping with criminals who may use well-developed technologies to commit immigration-related offences and some potential complicated crimes in the future. The Group has been proactively combatting cybercrimes related to illegal employment by conducting constant ""cyber patrols"". It will take resolute enforcement actions against any person who is found using social media or instant messaging software to organise, arrange or incite the public to commit serious crimes, such as illegal employment etc.

The ImmD and the Police will continue to combat illegal employment related crimes rigourously, and will, depending on operational needs, risk assessment and other considerations, flexibly arrange sufficient manpower to conduct intelligence-led enforcement operations against illegal employment related crimes.

Publicity and education to raise law-abiding awareness

In order to raise the public's law-abiding awareness and let the employers understand the serious consequences of employing illegal workers, the ImmD has deployed officers and promotional vehicles to black spots of illegal employment from time to time to distribute ""Don't Employ Illegal Workers"" leaflets to employers and remind them to inspect the original Hong Kong Identity Cards of job seekers to ascertain whether they are lawfully employable. At the same time, the ImmD has also actively published information on the effectiveness of the latest operations against illegal employment and disseminated the message of ""Employing Illegal Workers is an Offence"" through its official accounts on different social media platforms. In addition, the ImmD has provided information of identifying lawfully employable persons to the public through various channels including ImmD's website, leaflets and seminars, etc."

LCQ1: Enhancing Leisure and Cultural Services Department's SmartPLAY system,2025-06-18 12:06,2025-06-18 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800305.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Carmen Kan and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Mr Raistlin Lau, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD)'s intelligent sports and recreation services booking and information system, SmartPLAY, which was developed at a cost of $500 million, was launched in 2023. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of complaints it has received and investigated since the launch of SmartPLAY in relation to hirers profiting from touting their booked sessions for use of recreation and sports facilities (touting activities); among these cases, of the respective numbers of those being punished according to the LCSD's penalties, prosecuted according to the law, and convicted; whether it has examined the effectiveness of SmartPLAY in combating touting activities, including whether its anti-bot solution can effectively block plug-in programmes from snatching up booking sessions;

(2) as some members of the public have reflected that the e-payment method for the LCSD venues allows non-hirers to pay venue hire charges, making it possible for touting agents to book the venues on others' behalf, whether there are any countermeasures in place; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; apart from the fact that minors may have their parents book recreation and sports facilities on their behalf, whether there are any other exceptional circumstances where third-party bookings are permitted; and

(3) as there are views that the current approach to allocation of venues (e.g. grass soccer pitches) by ballot is more effective than the first-come, first-served approach in combating touting activities, whether the authorities will consider allocating all recreational and sports facilities by ballot; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) launched a brand new intelligent sports and recreation services booking information system named SmartPLAY in November 2023 to replace the old Leisure Link Computer Booking System. The SmartPLAY system is an integrated one-stop electronic service platform designed to facilitate the public in searching for and booking the sports and recreation facilities of the LCSD, as well as enrolling in various kinds of sports and recreation activities or competitions through the internet or mobile application. At present, the SmartPLAY system has 1.07 million registered users with 28 000 daily booking transactions on average.

My reply to the the Hon Carmen Kan's question is set out below:

(1) The LCSD has always paid close attention to unauthorised transfer or touting activities in relation to sports and recreation facilities, and adopted a multi-pronged approach to combat touting activities, including enhancing the booking system on an ongoing basis, imposing penalty arrangements, and stepping up inspections. At present, the SmartPLAY system includes the following functions to combat touting activities:

(i) adopting real-name registration;
(ii) allocating popular sports and recreation facilities by ballot in addition to the first-come, first-served allocation mechanism;
(iii) requiring hirers to declare and undertake that they will be present during the use of relevant facilities and that the user permit will not be transferred by any means when booking and signing for facilities via the SmartPLAY system. Offenders may have committed an offence of fraud under the Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210) and be liable to imprisonment of up to 14 years upon conviction; and
(iv) imposing restrictions to prohibit the booking of overlapping sessions of fee-charging or non-fee charging sports and recreation facilities.

In addition to enhancing the SmartPLAY system, the LCSD closely monitors information on touting and inspects venues from time to time, including conducting surprise inspections and requiring hirers to present identification documents to facilitate investigation and follow-up immediately as necessary. If a hirer is not present during the booked session, it will be counted as a breach. A hirer who has accumulated two breaches within 60 days will result in a 90-day ban on booking fee-charging sports and recreation facilities under the LCSD. Since the commissioning of the SmartPLAY system until May 2025, the LCSD has conducted over 890 000 random inspections, with more than 13 000 hirers being penalised for breaches, i.e. being suspended from booking the LCSD fee-charging sports and recreation facilities for 90 days. From November 2023 to May this year, the LCSD received a total of 435 complaints relating to touting activities. Upon investigation, the LCSD imposed penalties for 50 cases of breaches. The LCSD will continue to monitor the situation and consider imposing heavier penalties on repeated offenders.

Furthermore, the LCSD launched a joint operation with law enforcement agencies in July 2024 at tennis courts in Wan Chai District to combat touting and other illegal activities. Several individuals were arrested successfully. Some of the individuals had been prosecuted and convicted, and were sentenced to imprisonment of four months and six months respectively. Other cases are still under trial or being processed.

To effectively combat the abuse of computer programmes for booking sports and recreation facilities, a new generation of Web Application Firewall and anti-bot technology have been introduced in the SmartPLAY system to closely monitor users' log-in activities. SmartPLAY also employs artificial intelligence (AI) to oversee users' behaviour and network usage for auto-defence, ensuring smooth operation of the system. When AI detects any abnormal operation (such as unusual log-in), the system will automatically intercept suspicious access. Moreover, the LCSD, in collaboration with the contractor, has been closely monitoring the operation of the system and adjusting its settings from time to time. More than five million log-in attempts by suspected bots were intercepted by the system during peak periods in early 2025. The LCSD and the contractor will continue to follow up and actively explore more solutions to prevent bot booking of sports and recreation facilities, thereby enhancing the booking experience of normal users.

(2) SmartPLAY is a one-stop electronic service platform that requires real-name registration. It enables the public to enquire about the sports and recreation facilities of the LCSD and make bookings anytime via the internet or mobile application with e-payment options. Owing to various circumstances (such as a lack of electronic payment tools or insufficient balances therein), individual users may not be able to use e-payment when booking facilities and require the assistance of others who are not hirers to make the payment and complete the process. Besides, parents of minors (aged under 18) may need to help manage their children's accounts for booking and payment. Therefore, the SmartPLAY system does not require the hirer and the payer to be the same person. That said, real-name registration of the hirer is required and the hirer must personally check in and be present to use the facilities.

(3) Currently, the LCSD allocates its sports and recreation facilities using two methods, namely on a first-come, first-served basis and balloting. To facilitate members of the public in planning their exercise schedule, the SmartPLAY system allows users to make seven-day advance bookings or on-the-spot hires of most of the sports and recreation facilities on a first-come, first-served basis. As for balloting, although it is a fair mechanism, it requires users to make advance planning by submitting balloting applications within 14 to 20 days before the usage date. Applicants must also pay attention to the balloting results and payment deadlines. Since both allocation methods have their own merits and drawbacks, the LCSD has conducted a questionnaire survey to collect public views on the mechanisms for booking and allocating various sports and recreation facilities under its purview.

After considering the feedback from different users as well as reviewing the actual usage carefully, the LCSD currently only allocates sessions of popular turf soccer pitches by balloting, while other sports and recreation facilities continue to be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. The LCSD will continue to pay close attention to the usage of its various facilities and review relevant booking arrangements with a view to encouraging the general public to engage in regular exercise.

Thank you, President."
立法會一題︰優化康樂及文化事務署的SmartPLAY系統,2025-06-18 12:06,2025-06-18 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800301.htm,"​以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上簡慧敏議員的提問和署理文化體育及旅遊局局長劉震的答覆︰

問題：

康樂及文化事務署（康文署）耗資五億元開發的智能康體服務預訂資訊系統SmartPLAY於二○二三年啓用。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）自SmartPLAY啓用至今，政府接獲及調查了多少宗涉及租用人炒賣其租訂的設施使用時段以牟利（「炒場」）的投訴；當中按康文署罰則懲處、按法例檢控，以及被定罪的個案宗數為何；有否檢視，SmartPLAY能否有效打擊「炒場」行為，包括其抗機械人程式方案能否有效阻截以外掛程式「搶場」的行為；

（二）鑑於有市民反映，康文署場地的電子支付方式容許非租用人支付場租，令「炒場」中介可代訂場地，當局有否應對措施；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；除未成年人可由父母代訂康體設施外，有否其他可代訂的例外情況；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為，目前以抽籤方式分配場地（例如草地足球場），較先到先得方式更能有效打擊「炒場」行為，當局會否研究全面以抽籤方式分配康體設施；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

康樂及文化事務署（康文署）在二○二三年十一月推出全新智能康體服務預訂資訊系統SmartPLAY，取代舊有的「康體通」電腦預訂系統。SmartPLAY系統是一體化一站式的電子服務平台，旨在方便市民透過互聯網或流動應用程式，查詢和預訂康文署的康體設施，以及報名參加各類康體活動或比賽。現時，SmartPLAY系統的登記用戶達107萬，每日完成的預訂記錄平均達28 000項。

就簡慧敏議員的提問，我現回覆如下：

（一）康文署一直十分關注康體場地的違規轉讓或炒賣情況，以多管齊下方式打擊「炒場」活動，包括持續透過優化訂場制度、設立懲罰安排、和加強巡查。現時，SmartPLAY系統阻止「炒場」的功能包括：

（i） 採用實名登記；
（ii）在先到先得的分配機制上，加入以抽籤方式分配熱門康體設施；
（iii）要求租用人在SmartPLAY系統訂場及簽場時，須聲明承諾將在場地內使用有關設施，並不得以任何形式轉讓用場許可證。違者或觸犯《盜竊罪條例》（第210章）下的欺詐罪，一經定罪，最高可被判監禁14年；以及
（iv）加入限制，讓租訂收費或免費康樂設施的時間均不能重疊。

除了優化SmartPLAY系統外，康文署密切留意有關「炒場」的資訊，並不時巡查場地，包括進行突擊巡察，要求租用人出示身份證明文件，以便在需要時即時作出調查和跟進。若租用人未在場地使用設施，將被視為一次違規。如在60日內累積兩次違規紀錄，將禁止有關租用人預訂康文署的收費康體設施90日。自SmartPLAY系統啓用至二○二五年五月，康文署已進行超過89萬次抽樣巡查，當中超過13 000名租用人因違規而受到懲處，即90日內不能預訂康文署的收費康體設施。在二○二三年十一月至今年五月期間，康文署共接獲435宗與「炒場」相關的投訴。經調查後，康文署對50宗違規個案作出懲處。康文署會繼續監察情況，並會考慮對重複違規人士加重罰則。

此外，康文署聯同執法部門於二○二四年七月在灣仔區內的網球場展開聯合行動，打擊「炒場」及其他違法行為，並成功拘捕數名涉案人士。其中部分人士已被起訴定罪，分別被判入獄6個月及4個月，其餘案件仍在審訊或處理中。

為有效打擊濫用電腦程式租用康樂場地，SmartPLAY系統已引入新一代的網上應用系統防火牆及抗機械人技術，密切監測用戶登入情況，並採用人工智能監察用戶行為及網絡使用情況，進行自動防衛，以確保系統運作暢順。當人工智能判斷出異常操作（例如發現有不尋常的登入情況）時，系統將自動攔截。此外，康文署與承辦商一直密切監察系統運作，並不時調整系統設定。二○二五年年初，系統在繁忙時段曾攔截超過500萬個可疑程式的登入請求。康文署和承辦商將持續跟進，積極研究更多防範機械人程式預訂康樂場地的方案，以提升正常用戶的預訂體驗。

（二）SmartPLAY系統是一個需實名登記的一站式的電子服務平台，讓市民隨時通過互聯網或流動應用程式查詢和預訂康文署的康體設施，並使用電子支付訂場。由於個別用戶可能因不同情況（例如缺乏電子支付工具或餘額不足）在預訂時無法使用電子支付，因此需要他人協助，使用非租用人名下的支付方式付款完成預訂。此外，未成年（18歲以下）用戶的父母也可能需要協助，代為處理子女的帳戶預訂及付款。因此，SmartPLAY系統並不要求租用人與支付人必須為同一人，但系統是實名登記，租用人必須親身簽場，並在場使用設施。

（三）現時，康文署採用兩種方式（即先到先得方式和抽籤方式）分配其康樂設施。為方便市民規劃其運動的時間，SmartPLAY系統允許使用者以先到先得方式，在用場前7日內預訂或即場租用大部分康體設施。至於抽籤方式，雖具公平性，但需使用者提前規劃，以便在用場前14至20日內提交抽籤申請。使用者亦須留意抽籤結果和付款期限。由於兩種分配方法各有利弊，康文署曾進行問卷調查，蒐集市民對預訂和分配轄下各康體設施機制的意見。

經考慮不同設施使用者的意見，謹慎審視實際使用情況後，康文署目前只採用抽籤方式分配熱門的草地足球場，其他康體設施則沿用先到先得方式。康文署會繼續密切留意轄下各設施的使用情況，在鼓勵恆常運動的目標下，檢討相關的預訂安排。

多謝主席。"
立法會二十題：減少碳排放,2025-06-18 12:00,2025-06-18 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800232.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上何敬康議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

政府於二○二一年十月發布《香港氣候行動藍圖2050》，力爭在二○三五‍年前將香港的碳排放量從二○○五年的水平減半，並提出「淨零發電」、「節能綠建」、「綠色運輸」和「全民減廢」四大減碳策略。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一） 會否因應近年本港碳排放量的實際情況，適當調整綠色政策以加快香港的整體減碳步伐，從而按時達到減碳目標；

（二） 過去五年，各政府部門在節能減排、降耗減碳、環保採購等重要減碳措施上的表現分別為何；政府部門有否就近年推行的一系列政策措施（包括成立「綠色科技及金融發展委員會」、實施無紙證券市場等）訂立減碳目標和時間表；

（三） 鑑於有意見認為，企業廣泛參與減碳工作對香港達致碳中和非常重要，截至本年五月，參加「綠色香港․碳審計」並簽署《減碳約章》，同意承擔和執行活動以支持減少排放溫室氣體的企業和機構數目為何；有否評估，參加的企業和機構在制訂及實行減碳措施上的成效為何；

（四）鑑於據悉，香港交易及結算所有限公司於二○二二年先後成立香港國際碳市場委員會和推出國際碳市場Core Climate，政府是否知悉，目前該委員會和Core Climate的運作情況，以及它們在推動企業在港實施減碳的成效分別為何；及

（五）鑑於綠色運輸是政府其中的一個減碳策略，當中包括通過推動車輛電動化，在二○五○年前達至車輛零排放和運輸界別零碳排放，並且會在二○三五年或之前停止新登記燃油和混合動力私家車，政府有否評估，現時相關工作的進度能否令減碳目標如期達到？

答覆：

主席:

就何敬康議員的提問，經諮詢財經事務及庫務局後，現回覆如下：

（一） 特區政府在《香港氣候行動藍圖2050》（《藍圖》）中提出「淨零發電」、「節能綠建」、「綠色運輸」和「全民減廢」四大減碳策略，帶領香港在二○三五年前把碳排放量從二○○五年的水平減半，以邁向二○五○年前實現碳中和的目標。隨著我們致力落實四大減碳策略，香港正穩步邁向二○三五年的減碳目標。

香港溫室氣體排放總量自二○一四年達峰後繼續呈下降趨勢。隨着香港逐步以天然氣和零碳能源取代燃煤發電、電動車普及化、減少都市固體廢物棄置量、以及增加堆填氣體回收及使用量以生產能源，二○二三年的溫室氣體排放總量比二○○五年的水平下降約百分之二十，與二○一四年排放峰值比較已下降約四分之一；二○二三年的人均溫室氣體排放量為4.58公噸，是自一九九○年的新低，比二○○五年及二○一四年均下降近三成，約是美國的四分之一及歐盟的六成。

應對氣候變化是一項長遠工作。我們會按《巴黎協定》精神，約每五年檢視《藍圖》，更新減碳和其他應對氣候變化的策略及目標，並預計於二○二六年發布檢視結果。

（二） 為加強政府部門的節能減排表現，政府內部有相關通告和指引，要求部門在日常運作中做好環保工作。具體內容包括節約能源、加強可再生能源使用、減廢回收、安裝電動車充電設施、節約用水及再用、採購環保產品和服務等措施以減低碳排放等。這些政府通告及指引涵蓋政府建築物的環保目標、碳排放管理、政府部門環保報告的制訂、以及環保採購等。

政府爭取在二○二四至二五年度將政府建築物和基建設施的整體能源表現提升超過百分之六（與二○一八至一九基準年相比）。機電工程署（機電署）每年要求各決策局和部門提供政府建築物和設施的能源消耗和可再生能源資料並舉辦簡報會與各決策局和部門就能源表現進行討論，以及為節能措施和可再生能源項目的規劃提供技術意見。截至二○二二至二三年度，政府的整體能源表現已提升約百分之五點三。雖然二○二三至二四年度的數據仍在編制中，但參考近年能源表現趨勢，我們有信心可以達到提升超過百分之六的目標。環境及生態局會繼續鼓勵各決策局及部門採取措施提升能源表現，並探討如何善用創新科技，以更具成本效益的方案推動政府建築物提升能源效益。

為協助政府決策局及部門以科學化的方式制定減排目標和推行減排措施，政府於二○一七年發布「政府建築物碳管理」通告，要求所有主要政府建築物需定期進行碳審計，並透過年度環保工作報告或以其他方式向公眾披露碳審計的結果。

此外，政府已為約250座政府建築物進行為期三年（即二○二○至二一至二○二二至二三年度）的能源暨碳排放審計，有系統地檢視建築物的能源消耗設備和系統，收集及整理相關排放源的活動數據，以找出能源管理和碳管理機會。為進一步加強政府的碳管理工作，我們把碳審計措施逐步由政府建築物推廣至具代表性的主要政府基建設施，包括濾水廠、污水處理設施、食水及海水抽水設施、道路照明設施和公共運輸交匯處的抽風系統等。碳審計的結果不但有助相關決策局及部門為這些設施以至同類型設施制定減碳策略，更可協助部門建立進行碳審計的機制和指引，方便日後為其他基建設施進行碳管理。《2025年建築物能源效益（修訂）條例草案》已在六月十一日獲立法會通過，並將在二○二六年九月全面生效。屆時，大部份政府建築物均須按法例要求定期進行能源審核。環境及生態局和機電署會向各政策局和部門提供技術支援，協助和鼓勵各部門落實在能源審核中辨識的節能機會。

政府一向實行環保採購，以落實環保理念。環境及生態局就政府經常使用的產品和服務制訂環保採購清單，當中羅列各項產品和服務的環保規格，以供政策局和部門進行環保採購。政府已於二○二一年七月擴大環保採購，把環保採購清單上所涵蓋的產品和服務由150種增加至183種，同時更新各項目的環保規格。決策局和部門於二○二四年合共採購總值84.2億元的環保產品和服務，較二○二三年的70.6億元增加約百分之十九點三。

由財政司司長擔任主席的綠色科技及金融發展委員會（委員會）於二○二三年六月成立，協助制訂行動綱領，推動香港發展為國際綠色科技及綠色金融中心。成員包括有關政策局、政府部門和金融監管機構的代表，以及來自金融、科技、學術、專業服務等界別的非官方成員。委員會討論的範疇涵蓋推動建設綠色科技生態圈、發展綠色金融、綠色運輸和綠色建築等，以及推廣和宣傳香港在相關方面的優勢。委員會會繼續就各個領域持續探討加速香港綠色科技和綠色金融的發展。

今年四月，政府實施新安排，容許公司採用默示同意機制透過網站向股東發布通訊，以推動本地上市及非上市公司以無紙化方式作出公司通訊，有助提升公司的成本效益和營運效率，並達致環保營商的目的。

（三） 政府推行「綠色香港․碳審計」活動，目的是鼓勵各界機構進行支持減低溫室氣體排放的活動。參與機構會按各自的情況，以不同的方式制訂及實行減碳措施包括推動碳審計，成立環境管理系統，以及安裝、更換節能辦公設備。現時有超過140個機構，包括物業管理公司、大學、專業團體、非牟利組織和其他商業界別的團體參加「綠色香港․碳審計」 。該活動除了提高參與機構的減碳意識，鼓勵機構進行碳審計及執行減碳計劃，亦可協助企業為應對有關氣候相關披露的新規定做好準備。

政府於去年十二月推出《香港可持續披露路線圖》，為大型公眾責任實體（包括大型上市發行人和具有重要影響力的非上市金融機構）的碳管理工作注入新動力。作為第一步，香港交易及結算所有限公司 （港交所）已引入依據《國際財務報告可持續披露準則第2號—氣候相關披露》所制定的新氣候信息披露規定，包括要求所有上市發行人均須強制披露範圍一及範圍二溫室氣體排放，新要求已於二○二五年一月起分階段實施。

為協助和便利香港企業和金融機構作可持續匯報，由相關政府政策局、金融監管機構及港交所組成的綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組（督導小組）分別推出了針對非上市公司／中小企業的「氣候和環境風險問卷」；以及與香港科技大學合作推出溫室氣體排放計算和估算工具，並在督導小組網站上免費開放予公眾使用。這些工具有助中小企業管理其環保足跡，促進市場參與者改善可持續發展的作業模式。

（四） 港交所於二○二二年七月成立香港國際碳市場委員會，成員包括內地、香港及國際多家領先企業及金融機構，協助香港建設高效率的國際碳市場，提供優越的市場基礎設施、產品和服務，促進區內向低碳經濟轉型。

港交所其後於同年十月推出國際碳市場Core Climate，支持市場進行高效和透明的碳信用產品和工具的交易，協助推動全球淨零轉型。Core Climate平台上交易的優質碳信用源自經國際認證的碳減排項目，包括亞洲、南美及非洲的林業、太陽能、風能及生物質能等項目。Core Climate是目前唯一為國際自願碳信用產品交易同時提供港元及人民幣結算的碳市場。參與者數目至去年底達100個。Core Climate至今已為不少企業進行碳信用交易提供可靠的結算服務、提高交易效率及降低結算風險，當中包括去年十二月國泰航空有限公司透過Core Climate結算50 000噸自願減排量，充分顯示了Core Climate在支援企業氣候轉型過程中扮演的重要角色。

政府將繼續與金融監管機構及持份者緊密合作，共同完善碳市場生態圈、拓展相關產品服務及優化交易機制和基礎設施，促進碳市場有序健康發展，為香港、國家乃至世界的減碳目標作出貢獻。

（五） 政府致力推廣使用電動車。二○二一年三月公布的《香港電動車普及化路線圖》，涵蓋各方面推動使用新能源運輸技術的政策方向和目標，引領香港在二○五○年前達到車輛零排放。近年香港在電動車普及化方面已取得顯著成果，電動車數量由五年前約一萬四千輛擴大八倍至去年底的約11萬輛。現時每10輛新登記私家車，有約七輛是電動私家車，比例位處世界前列，增長勢頭良好。

充電網絡對推動電動車普及化非常重要。截至二○二五年三月，香港已經有近10萬個停車位備有充電基礎設施。公共充電設施則有11 180個，當中約2 000個是快速或高速充電設施。我們將繼續多管齊下增加充電設施，包括透過（一）收緊豁免計算樓宇總樓面面積的措施，鼓勵新建私人樓宇停車位配備充電基礎設施；以及（二）推行35億元的「EV屋苑充電易資助計劃」，協助現有私人住宅樓宇及屋苑停車場內的停車位安裝電動車充電基礎設施。估計在二○二七年年中前將有超過20萬個私人樓宇停車位配備充電基礎設施。

公共充電設施方面，政府在去年年底公布的《公共巴士和的士綠色轉型路線圖》羅列了多項措施，持續擴展公共充電網絡，包括將加油站改建為高速充電站或加裝高速充電樁，及開放巴士車廠的充電樁等。《行政長官2024年施政報告》亦宣布推出三億元鼓勵計劃，目標是由二○二六年至二○二八年年底提供3 000支高速充電樁並投入服務，以額外支援約16萬輛電動車。預計鼓勵計劃會於未來一兩個月內推出並開始接受申請。

此外，環境及生態局已成立了跨部門工作小組，盡力協調解決各方在設立充電設施時遇到的困難。

透過上述多項措施，我們有信心本港日趨完備的充電網絡會進一步推動車輛電動化，最終達致相關減碳目標。"
LCQ20: Carbon emission reduction,2025-06-18 12:00,2025-06-18 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800243.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Adrian Ho and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

In October 2021, the Government announced Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050, which aims to reduce Hong Kong's carbon emissions by half from the 2005 level before 2035 and outlines four major decarbonisation strategies, namely net-zero electricity generation, energy saving and green buildings, green transport and waste reduction. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will duly adjust its green policies in response to Hong Kong's actual carbon emissions in recent years to accelerate the overall pace of decarbonisation in Hong Kong and thus achieve its carbon reduction targets as scheduled;

(2) of the respective performances of various government departments over the past five years in key carbon reduction measures, such as energy saving, emission reduction, consumption and carbon emission reduction, as well as green procurement; whether government departments have set carbon reduction targets and timetables for the series of policy measures implemented in recent years, including the establishment of the Green Technology and Finance Development Committee and the implementation of the Uncertificated Securities Market initiative;

(3) as there are views that the broad participation of businesses in decarbonisation efforts is vital for Hong Kong to achieve carbon neutrality, how many businesses and organisations have, as of May this year, joined the ""Green Hong Kongï¼Carbon Audit"" campaign by signing the Carbon Reduction Charter and agreeing to undertake and implement activities in support of reducing greenhouse gas emissions; whether it has assessed the effectiveness of the participating businesses and organisations in formulating and implementing carbon reduction measures;

(4) as it is learnt that the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited established the Hong Kong International Carbon Market Council and subsequently launched an international carbon marketplace ""Core Climate"" in 2022, whether Government is aware of the current operational status of both the Council and Core Climate, as well as their respective effectiveness in promoting the implementation of decarbonisation measures among businesses in Hong Kong; and

(5) given that green transport is one of the Government's decarbonisation strategies, which includes achieving zero vehicular emissions and zero carbon emissions in the transport sector before 2050 through promoting the electrification of vehicles, and ceasing new registrations of fuel-propelled and hybrid private cars in or before 2035, whether the Government has assessed if the current progress of such efforts will enable the carbon reduction targets to be achieved on schedule?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the reply to the question raised by the Hon Adrian Ho is as follows:

(1) The Government has proposed four major decarbonisation strategies in the Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050, namely net-zero electricity generation, energy saving and green buildings, green transport and waste reduction, to lead Hong Kong to halve its carbon emissions from the 2005 level by 2035, with a view to achieving carbon neutrality before 2050. With our efforts in recent years in these four decarbonisation strategies, Hong Kong is making steady progress towards the carbon reduction target of 2035.

Hong Kong's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been on a downward trend after reaching its peak in 2014. With the gradual replacement of coal-fired power generation by natural gas and zero-carbon energy, the popularisation of electric vehicles, the reduction of municipal solid waste disposal, and the increased recovery and use of landfill gas for energy generation in Hong Kong, the total GHG emissions in 2023 were reduced by about 20 per cent from the 2005 level and about a quarter from the peak in 2014. The per capita GHG emissions in 2023 was 4.58 tonnes, which is a new low since 1990. It is nearly 30 per cent lower than those in 2005 and 2014, and is about a quarter of that of the United States and 60 per cent of that of the European Union.

Combating climate change is a long-term task. In line with the spirit of the Paris Agreement, we will review the Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050 about every five years to update the strategies and targets for decarbonisation and other climate actions, and expect to release the review result in 2026.

(2) To enhance the performance of government departments in energy conservation and carbon emissions, the Government has promulgated relevant internal circulars and guidelines to require departments to perform well in the area of environmental protection in their daily operations. Specific measures include energy conservation, adoption of renewable energy (RE), waste reduction and recycling, installation of electric vehicle charging facilities, water conservation and recycling, procurement of green products and services, etc. with a view to reducing carbon emissions. These government circulars and guidelines cover environmental targets for government buildings, carbon emission management, preparation of environmental reports by government departments, as well as green procurement, etc.

The Government strives to improve the overall energy performance of government buildings and infrastructure by more than 6 per cent in 2024-25, compared to the 2018-19 baseline. To this end, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) has requested all bureaux and departments (B/Ds) to provide information on the energy consumption and RE of government buildings and facilities annually, and organised briefing sessions to discuss energy performance, and provides technical advice on energy-saving measures and planning of RE projects. As at 2022-23, the Government's overall energy performance has improved by about 5.3 per cent. While the data for 2023-24 is still being compiled, based on the recent trends in energy performance, the Government is confident that the target of over 6 per cent improvement can be achieved. The Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) will continue to encourage all B/Ds to take measures to enhance energy performance and explore means to leverage innovative technologies to promote cost-effective solutions for improving energy efficiency in government buildings.

To assist government B/Ds in setting emission reduction targets and implementing emission reduction measures in a more scientific way, the Government promulgated the ""Carbon Management in Government Buildings"" circular in 2017 which requires all major government buildings to conduct regular carbon audits, the results of which should be disclosed to the public through the publication of annual environmental performance reports or other means.

Furthermore, the Government has conducted a three-year (from 2020-21 to 2022-23) energy-cum-carbon audit in about 250 government buildings, to review systematically the energy consumption equipment and systems in these buildings, collect and compile activity data on relevant emission sources to identify energy and carbon management opportunities. To further enhance the Government's carbon management efforts, we progressively extend the carbon audit practice to typical major government infrastructure, including water treatment works, sewage treatment facilities, fresh water and salt water pumping facilities, road lighting systems and ventilation systems at public transport interchanges, etc. The results of the carbon audits will not only help relevant B/Ds formulate carbon reduction strategies for the above infrastructure and similar facilities, but will also assist them in establishing a mechanism and guidelines for conducting carbon audits, which will in turn facilitate the carbon management efforts for other infrastructure in the future. The Buildings Energy Efficiency (Amendment) Bill 2025 was passed by the Legislative Council on June 11 and will come into full effect in September 2026. By then, most government buildings will be statutorily required to conduct regular energy audits. The EEB and the EMSD will provide technical support to various B/Ds to assist and encourage them to implement energy-saving opportunities identified in energy audits.

The Government has been adopting green procurement to implement environmental protection. The EEB has developed a green procurement list, setting out green specifications for the products and services commonly used by the Government, so that B/Ds may practise green procurement. In July 2021, the Government expanded the scope of green procurement by increasing the number of products and services covered in the green procurement list from 150 items to 183 items, as well as updating the green specifications of each item. In 2024, B/Ds altogether procured green products and services with a total value of $8.42 billion, which is an increase of about 19.3 per cent as compared to $7.06 billion in 2023.

The Green Technology and Finance Development Committee (Committee) was established in June 2023 under the chairmanship of the Financial Secretary to assist in the formation of an action agenda for promoting the development of Hong Kong into an international green technology and financial centre. Members include representatives from relevant policy bureaux, departments and financial regulators, as well as non-official members from finance, technology, academic, professional services sectors, etc. The Committee's discussions cover promoting the development of a green technology ecosystem, green finance, green transport, green buildings, etc., as well as promoting and publicising Hong Kong's strengths in these areas. The Committee will continue to explore accelerating the development of green technology and green finance in Hong Kong across various areas.

In April this year, the Government implemented new arrangements to allow companies to adopt implied consent mechanism for disseminating corporate communication by publication on their websites, in order to promote paperless corporate communication for listed and unlisted Hong Kong companies, thereby improving cost-effectiveness and efficiency of companies and promoting a green business environment.

(3) The Government launched the ""Green Hong Kongï¼Carbon Audit"" campaign with a view to encouraging organisations of various sectors to support greenhouse gas emission reduction activities. The participating organisations would, according to their respective situations, formulate and implement carbon reduction measures such as promoting carbon audits, establishing environmental management systems, and installing and replacing energy-efficient office equipment. Currently, over 140 organisations, including property management companies, universities, professional bodies, non-profit-making organisations and other business organisations, have joined the ""Green Hong Kongï¼Carbon Audit"" campaign. In addition to raising the awareness of participating organisations in carbon reduction and encouraging these organisations to conduct carbon audits and implement carbon reduction plans, the campaign also helps corporates prepare for addressing new climate-related disclosure requirements.

The Government launched in December last year the Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in Hong Kong (Roadmap), injecting new impetus into the carbon management work of large publicly accountable entities (PAEs) (including large listed issuers and non-listed financial institutions carrying a significant weight). As the first step, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has introduced new climate-related disclosures requirements (New Climate Requirements) which have been developed based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) S2 Climate-related Disclosures. The New Climate Requirements, covering, among others, mandating all listed issuers to disclose scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions, have been implemented in phases starting from January 2025.

To assist and facilitate sustainability reporting by corporates and financial institutions in Hong Kong, the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (Steering Group), formed by relevant Government bureaux, financial regulators and HKEX, launched the ""Climate and Environmental Risk Questionnaire"" for non-listed companies/ small and medium enterprises (SMEs); and GHG emissions calculation and estimation tools in collaboration with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Available for free public access on the Steering Group's website, these tools help SMEs manage their environmental footprint and encourage market participants to improve sustainable business practices.

(4) HKEX launched the Hong Kong International Carbon Market Council (the Council) in July 2022, with members comprising Mainland, Hong Kong, and international corporates and financial institutions, to facilitate the development of an efficient and effective Hong Kong-based international carbon market with best-in-class market infrastructure, products and services, promoting the transition to a low-carbon economy in the region.

Subsequently, HKEX launched the Core Climate, an international carbon marketplace, in October in the same year, facilitating effective and transparent trading of carbon credits and instruments to support the global transition to Net Zero. It offers quality carbon credits from internationally-certified projects in Asia, South America and Africa, covering forestry, solar, wind and biomass initiatives. Core Climate is currently the only carbon marketplace that offers HKD and RMB settlement for the trading of international voluntary carbon credits. The platform's participant number reached 100 by end of 2024. Core Climate has facilitated carbon credit trading by various corporates through the provision of trustworthy settlement services, enhancing efficiency and mitigating risks, including Cathay Pacific Airways Limited's settlement of 50 000 tonnes of voluntary carbon credits in December last year, fully demonstrating the important role of Core Climate in supporting corporates on their climate transition journey.

The Government will continue to work closely with the financial regulators and stakeholders to collaboratively enhance the carbon market ecosystem, expand related products and services, and optimise trading mechanisms and infrastructure to promote the orderly and healthy development of the carbon market, contributing to the decarbonisation targets of Hong Kong, our country, as well as the world.

(5) The Government is committed to promoting the use of electric vehicles (EV). The Hong Kong Roadmap on Popularisation of Electric Vehicles announced in March 2021 covers policy directions and targets in various areas in promoting the adoption of new energy transport technologies, so as to guide Hong Kong towards zero vehicular emissions before 2050. In recent years, Hong Kong has achieved remarkable results in the popularisation of EV. The number of EV was eightfold from about 14 000 five years ago to about 110 000 at the end of last year. Currently, about seven out of every ten newly registered private cars are electric private cars (e-PC), and the proportion is among the highest in the world, with a good growth momentum.

Charging network is critical to the popularisation of EV. As of March 2025, Hong Kong had nearly 100000 parking spaces equipped with charging infrastructure. There are 11180 public charging facilities, of which about 2000 are quick or fast charging facilities. We will continue to adopt a multi-pronged approach to increase charging facilities, including (i) tightening the exemption measure for calculating the gross floor area of buildings to encourage parking spaces in new private buildings to be equipped with charging infrastructure; and (ii) launching the $3.5 billion ""EV-charging at Home Subsidy Scheme"" to assist existing private residential buildings and housing estate car parks to install EV charging infrastructure. It is estimated that by mid-2027, more than200 000 parking spaces in private buildings will be equipped with charging infrastructure.

In terms of public charging facilities, the Government's Green Transformation Roadmap of Public Buses and Taxis published at the end of last year listed a number of measures to continue to expand the public charging network, including converting petrol filling stations into fast charging stations or adding fast chargers, and opening up chargers in bus depots, etc. The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address also announced the launch of a $300 million incentive scheme, with the target to provide and put into service 3 000 fast chargers from 2026 to the end of 2028 to support about 160000 EV. It is expected that the incentive scheme will be launched and start to receive applications in the coming one to two months.

Furthermore, EEB has set up an interdepartmental working group to coordinate and resolve difficulties encountered by various parties in setting up charging facilities.

Through the above measures, we are confident that Hong Kong's increasingly complete charging network will further promote vehicle electrification and ultimately achieve the relevant carbon reduction goals."

舉辦演唱會帶來可觀的經濟效益和就業機會，亦能帶動社會氣氛，刺激本地消費。政府十分歡迎各商業機構在香港舉辦外地和本地歌星及組合的演唱會。其中，啟德體育園於今年三月正式啟用，為香港帶來規模最大和最頂尖的活動場地，並已迅速成為大型國際娛樂及體育盛事的新據點。

就黃英豪議員的提問，經諮詢運輸及物流局和保安局，現回覆如下：

（一）為了讓參與大型演唱會的市民和旅客獲得良好體驗，各相關部門和機構（例如康樂及文化事務署、香港警務處、運輸署、活動主辦方、場地管理方及公共交通營辦商）會就每個大型演唱會保持緊密聯繫，商討各項細節安排，例如進行風險評估及人手資源部署，制定並落實人流管控、信息發布、交通疏導及口岸安排的綜合預案，以確保活動安全有序地進行，並準備充分預案應對突發情況。

就啟德體育園而言，文化體育及旅遊局一直監督和指導啟德體育園有限公司（體育園營運公司）與各政府部門、活動主辦方及公共交通營運商的溝通和合作，制定不同準備工作，包括根據演唱會人數、性質、結束時間和票務情況的因素進行評估，並按需要制定相應安排，例如開設特別巴士路線、加密港鐵服務和通報口岸。體育園營運公司亦會在大型演唱會前發放新聞稿和於社交平台上發布最新活動安排和場地守則。在演唱會結束後，相關部門和營運公司會總結經驗以進一步優化往後的運作。

為疏導大型活動完結後經各邊境管制站過境的旅客，相關部門會密切監察各管制站的實時情況，於有需要時彈性調配人手加開檢查櫃枱及通道，以疏導人流及車流。相關部門亦會與內地對應口岸的相關部門保持緊密聯繫，確保口岸運作暢順。

以今年五月二十四日晚上分別在啟德體育園、亞洲國際博覽館、香港體育館舉行三場演唱會後的交通安排為例，由於預期有相當數量的旅客在演唱會後經落馬洲／皇崗口岸返回內地，運輸署提前與跨境巴士和落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）的營辦商作出協調，以加密班次疏導旅客。就啟德體育園而言，當晚投入服務的跨境巴士數量為平日的雙倍，並在演唱會結束後的一小時內完成疏導預先購票的約3 300位旅客；而皇巴經加密班次後，亦在一小時內（由凌晨零時至一時許）基本完成接載所有旅客由新田總站前往落馬洲管制站。

（二）及（三）根據我們的估計，二○二四年至二○二五年上半年會有超過285場過萬名觀眾的大型演唱會，粗略估算這些演唱會有超過390萬名觀眾；當中有超過140萬旅客，他們為香港帶來約34億元消費額，經濟增加值約19億元。

二○二四年至二○二五年（截至五月三十一日）期間，在啟德主場館和啟德體藝館、亞洲國際博覽館、香港體育館及伊利沙伯體育館舉辦的所有演唱會入場人數表列如下：

LCQ9: Holding of large-scale concerts,2025-06-18 11:32,2025-06-18 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800255.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Kennedy Wong and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

It is learnt that a number of large-scale concerts have been held recently at the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP), the AsiaWorld-Expo, the Hong Kong Coliseum and the Queen Elizabeth Stadium respectively, attracting tens of thousands of local and overseas ""fans"", and large-scale music events will also be held at the KTSP's Main Stadium one after another. Some commercial tenants in Kai Tak have pointed out that their sales volume surged by three times on the days of the aforesaid concerts, while the business of some catering establishments in Kowloon City District also increased by more than 30 per cent. On the other hand, there were cases in which a large number of Mainland fans had to wait for a long time before they could cross the border via the Huanggang Port after the aforesaid concerts. In this connection, will the authorities concerned inform this Council:

(1) in view of the successive holding of large-scale music events and concerts as mega events, whether the Government has established a regular inter-departmental collaboration mechanism to assess and make preparations before the holding of each of the large-scale activities concerned, as well as to make a summary afterwards and announce the situation in a timely manner; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) given that large-scale concerts were held at the AsiaWorld-Expo and various sports venues before and after the opening of the KTSP, whether the Government has compiled statistics on the attendances of such concerts and, among them, the respective ratios of local, overseas and Mainland audiences; and

(3) whether the Government has assessed the economic benefits in promoting the growth of the hotel, catering, retail and transportation industries, etc, as well as creating job opportunities and so on during the aforesaid large-scale concerts; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Pop concerts brings substantial economic benefits and employment opportunities, creates a positive atmosphere in society and stimulates local consumption. The Government welcomes commercial organisations to hold concerts of singers and groups of Hong Kong and other places in the city. With its official commissioning in March, the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) provides Hong Kong with the largest and state-of-the-art venues, and quickly becomes a new hub for hosting major international sports and entertainment events.

In consultation with the Transport and Logistics Bureau and the Security Bureau, my reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Kennedy Wong is as follows:

(1) To offer a pleasant experience to residents and tourists participating in large-scale pop concerts, relevant departments and organisations, for example the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Transport Department (TD), event organisers, venue management, public transport operators, maintains close liaison to discuss the detailed arrangements for every large-scale pop concert. Those arrangements include conducting risk assessments, deploying manpower, formulating and implementing comprehensive plans for crowd control, information dissemination, traffic diversion and control point arrangements, with a view to ensuring that the events will take place in a safe and orderly manner with well-prepared contingency plans for any unforeseen circumstances.

For the KTSP, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau monitors and guides the Kai Tak Sports Park Limited (the operator) in the communication and collaboration with various government departments, event organisers, and public transport providers to implement different preparatory work. Based on factors such as the number of attendees, the nature, ending times, and ticketing situations of the concerts, we make corresponding arrangements as needed, such as arranging special bus routes, increasing frequency of the Mass Transit Railway services, and notifying border control points. The operator also issues press releases and publicises the latest event arrangements and venue rules on social media prior to large-scale pop concerts. After the concerts conclude, relevant departments and the operator consolidate their experience with a view to further optimising the operation of events and concerts in the future.

To facilitate the flow of passengers travelling through various boundary control points (BCPs) after large-scale events, relevant departments closely monitor the real-time situation of BCPs, make flexible deployment of manpower and operate additional counters and channels as necessary with a view to facilitating passenger and vehicular movements. Relevant departments also maintain close liaison with their Mainland counterparts to ensure smooth operations at BCPs.

Taking the traffic arrangements after the three concerts held at the KTSP, the AsiaWorld-Expo (AWE) and the Hong Kong Coliseum (HKC) on the evening of May 24 this year as an example, as it was expected that a considerable number of passengers would return to the Mainland via the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Control Point after the concerts, the TD co-ordinated with the operators of cross-boundary coaches and Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) in advance to increase the frequency of services to divert passengers. For the traffic arrangements at the KTSP, the number of cross-boundary coaches in service that night was double that of normal days, and about 3 300 passengers who had purchased tickets in advance were diverted within one hour after the concert ended; and after increasing the frequency of the Yellow Bus, it basically completed the transportation of all passengers from San Tin Terminus to Lok Ma Chau Control Point within one hour (from 00.00 to around 01.00).

(2) and (3) According to our estimates, more than 285 performance sessions of pop concerts with over 10 000 spectators would be held throughout 2024 and first half of 2025. As a ballpark, these concerts would attract over 3.9 million spectators, including over 1.4 million tourists, whose spending is estimated to be about HK$3.4 billion, bringing a value add of about HK$1.9 billion to the Hong Kong economy.

In 2024 and 2025 (as at May 31), the attendances of all pop concerts at the Kai Tak Stadium and the Kai Tak Arena, the AWE, the HKC and the Queen Elizabeth Stadium (QES) are set out below:

Since the official commissioning of the KTSP, various renowned international and Asian bands and singers have staged a total of 15 large-scale concerts at the Kai Tak Stadium and the Kai Tak Arena, with more than half of the spectators coming from the Mainland and overseas. For pop concerts at the AWE, spectators from the Mainland and overseas take up over 30 per cent of the attendances."

立法會十一題：人才入境計劃的申請費及簽證費,2025-06-18 11:20,2025-06-18 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800249.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上盧偉國議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

財政司司長在二○二五至二六年度的《財政預算案》中宣布，各項人才及資本投資者入境計劃將收取申請費600元，獲批申請的簽證費用則由本來劃一收費230元，按簽證／入境證逗留期限長短上調至600元（不超過180日）或1,300元（181日或以上）。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，入境事務處就各項人才入境計劃簽證申請收取230元簽證費用的人數為何，並按簽證／入境證逗留期限（即七日或以下、八日至一個月、兩個月至六個月，以及六個月以上）列出分項數字；

（二）有否預計，在新收費架構下，每年繳付600元及1,300‍元簽證／入境證簽發費的人數，以及政府相應收到的申請費和簽證費總額分別為何；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見指出，新的簽證費（逗留期限不超過180‍天）加上申請費實際上是由230元增至1,200元，對於短暫來港工作的人士（例如來港一兩天為粵劇表演作樂曲拍和的樂師）影響甚大，也不利於「灣區文旅一盤棋」等文化旅遊政策目標的落實，當局會否考慮為該等短暫來港工作人士減免相關簽證費用；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

各項人才與資本投資者的入境計劃（指定入境計劃）自推出或優化以來廣受歡迎。就人才入境計劃而言，首次入境申請數目由二○二二年約58000宗激增至二○二三年超過221000宗及二○二四年約208000宗，增幅超過250%。處理此類申請需要大量行政資源。在參考海外地區類似申請的收費後，政府決定在《2025-26年度財政預算案》公布當天起，就指定入境計劃的每宗入境、改變逗留條件或延長逗留限期的申請（包括主申請人及其受養人的申請）增設600元的申請費，而簽證／入境證的簽發費則按其逗留期限長短實施兩級制收費，由原來的230元上調至600元（逗留期限180日或以下）或1,300元（逗留期限181日或以上），以反映成本及體現「用者自付」原則。

就議員的提問，經諮詢入境事務處（入境處）後，現答覆如下：

（一）及（三）現時七個人才入境計劃中，高端人才通行證計劃、優秀人才入境計劃、非本地畢業生留港／回港就業安排、輸入中國籍香港永久性居民第二代計劃和科技人才入境計劃下首次獲批的簽證／入境證有效期一般為24個月或以上。至於與就業掛鈎的一般就業政策和輸入內地人才計劃，申請人獲批的簽證／入境證有效期一般根據其僱傭合約有效期限而定，由一天至36個月不等。

在二○二二至二三年度，各項人才入境計劃下各類型申請有約16萬宗獲入境處批准；二○二三至二四和二○二四至二五年度均有約30萬宗獲批申請。入境處沒有備存問題問及的其他分項數字，惟按日常處理經驗，在一般就業政策和輸入內地人才計劃下，超過一半的獲批申請涉及短期／一次性項目為本的工作，例如會議和表演。這些簽證／入境證的逗留期限一般為180天或以下。考慮到相關情況，政府就簽證／入境證簽發費實施兩級制，其中逗留期限不超過180日的簽證的費用定為600元，而逗留期限為181日或以上的則為1,300元。我們認為有關收費水平合理，已平衡各方面的考慮因素，包括「用者自付」原則及對相關申請者的影響，而對於入境計劃所針對的人才和資本投資者來説亦為可負擔的水平。過去數月指定入境計劃的申請和簽證／入境證簽發數目與去年同期相若，可見新收費架構並無影響香港對外來人才的吸引力。

（二）在考慮新收費架構時，政府根據二○二三年初至二○二四年八月底的相關數據，估算二○二五至二六至二○二八至二九年三個財政年度內，每年將收到約40萬宗指定入境計劃各類型申請，並發出約34萬張逗留期限為181日或以上的簽證／入境證，而逗留期限不超過180日的則為約26000張。以此為基礎，估計未來三個財政年度每年因新收費結構而產生的收入約為七億元，當中包括約2.5億元申請費及約4.5億簽證／入境證簽發費。"
LCQ11: Application fee and visa fee for talent admission schemes,2025-06-18 11:20,2025-06-18 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800250.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Lo Wai-kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

 The Financial Secretary announced in the 2025-2026 Budget that an application fee of $600 would be charged for various talent and capital investment admission schemes. The visa fee for approved applications would also increase based on the length of limit of stay of the visa/entry permit, rising from the original flat rate of $230 to $600 (not more than 180 days) or $1,300 (181 days or more). In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of persons charged a visa fee of $230 by the Immigration Department for visa applications under various talent admission schemes over the past three years, with a breakdown by length of stay of the visa/entry permit (i.e. seven days or less, eight days to one month, two months to six months, and over six months);

(2) whether it has estimated the respective numbers of persons who will pay $600 and $1,300 visa/entry permit issuance fees each year under the new fee structure, as well as the corresponding total amount of application and visa fees received by the Government accordingly; if it has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views that the new visa fee (with a limit of stay of not more than 180 days) together with the application fee, has actually increased from $230 to $1,200, which will greatly impact those coming to Hong Kong for short-term work (e.g. musicians coming to Hong Kong to compose and perform music for Cantonese opera performances for one to two days), and it is not conducive to the implementation of the policy objectives on culture and tourism, such as the integrated development of culture and tourism in the Greater Bay Area, whether the authorities will consider waiving the relevant visa fees for persons coming to Hong Kong for short-term employment; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The various admission schemes for talents and capital investors (specified admission schemes) have been well received since their introduction or enhancement. In respect of talent admission schemes, the number of applications for first entry has grown from around 58000 in 2022 to more than 221000 in 2023 and around 208000 in 2024, representing an increase of more than 250 per cent compared with 2022. Processing such applications involve substantial administrative resources. With reference to the fees charged for similar applications in overseas jurisdictions, the Government decided to, with effect from the day of the announcement of the 2025-26 Budget, introduce an application fee of $600 for each of the applications under the specified admission schemes for entry, change of conditions of stay or extension of limit of stay (including principal and dependant applications); and the visa/entry permit fees for approved applications will be increased, based on the length of the limit of stay, from the original rate of $230 to $600 (with a limit of stay of 180 days or below) or $1,300 (with a limit of stay of 181 days or more) to peg to their costs and reflect the ""user pays"" principle.

 Our reply, in consultation with the Immigration Department (ImmD), to the Member's questions is as follows:

(1) and (3) At present, among the seven talent admission schemes, the validity period of the first approved visas/entry permits under the Top Talent Pass Scheme, theQuality Migrant Admission Scheme, theImmigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates, theAdmission Scheme for the Second Generation of Chinese Hong Kong Permanent Residents, and theTechnology Talent Admission Scheme is generally 24 months or above. For the employment-tied General Employment Policy (GEP) andtheAdmission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP), the validity period of the applicants' approved visas/entry permits is generally determined by the validity period of their employment contracts, ranging from one day to 36 months.

 In 2022-23, about 160000 applications of different types under the various talent admission schemes were approved by the ImmD; and about 300000 applications were approved in both 2023-24 and 2024-‍25. The ImmD does not maintain the other statistical breakdowns referred to in the question. However, based on the experience from day-to-day processing, more than half of the approved applications under the GEP and the ASMTP are related to short-term/one-off project-based employment, e.g. for conference and performance, with a limit of stay of 180 days or below. Taking into account the relevant circumstances, the Government introduced two tiers of visa/entry permit issuance fee, which is set at $600 for visa granted with a limit of stay of not more than 180 days, and $1,300 for those with a limit of stay of 181 days or more. We consider that the fee levels are modest, and have balanced various considerations including the ""user pays"" principle and the impact on the applicants concerned. They are affordable to talent and capital investors targeted by the admission schemes. The numbers of applications and visas/entry permits issued under the specified admission schemes in the past few months are comparable to those in the same period last year, indicating that the new fee structure has not affected Hong Kong's attractiveness to outside talent.

(2) In considering the new fee structure, the Government, based on the relevant statistics from early 2023 to end August 2024, estimated that the annual caseload for the three financial years from 2025-26 to 2028-29 would be about 400000 applications of different types under the specified admission schemes; approximately 340000 visas/entry permits would be issued for a limit of stay of 181 days or more, while around 26000 will be issued for a limit of stay of not more than 180 days. On this basis, the estimated annual revenue in the next three financial years arising from the new fee structure is around $700 million, comprising about $250 million of application fees and about $450 million of visa/entry permit issuance fees."

答覆：

主席：

運輸署一直與香港科技園公司（科技園公司）密切監察香港科學園（科學園）的交通需求，以規劃合適的交通配套和服務，方便科學園的職員往返園區工作。就黃錦輝議員的提問，經諮詢運輸署、創新科技署及科技園公司後，現回覆如下：

（一）為配合科學園職員上下班的交通需求，現時有20條以科學園為總站或途經科學園的專營巴士路線於工作日的上下午繁忙時段提供服務。其服務範圍覆蓋港九新界多區，包括沙田、北區、大埔、屯門、元朗、荃灣、葵青、將軍澳、觀塘、油尖旺、灣仔、東區及離島區（包括機場）。另外，非繁忙時段亦設有六條專營巴士及五條專線小巴路線提供全日的穿梭服務，分別連接科學園及港鐵大學站、港鐵沙田站、沙田及馬鞍山。

運輸署一直積極與相關公共運輸服務營辦商（營辦商）保持緊密聯繫，因應乘客需求的變化，適時調整往返科學園的服務，以滿足乘客的出行需求。過去幾年，因應科學園及鄰近地區的發展及乘客需求變化，運輸署與營辦商商討及協調後，加強了來往科學園的交通服務，包括開辦新的專營巴士路線、安排特別班次、增加繁忙時段的服務等。詳情載於附件。

（二）科學園第二階段擴建計劃第一批次工程涉及興建一座主要用作濕實驗室的大樓（即18W大樓）、在科技大道東增加公共運輸設施，以及於科學園路／創新路路口進行改善工程。科學園路／創新路路口的改善工程已於去年十二月完成並啓用；18W大樓的建築工程已於今年三月完成，預計於今年七月啓用；而相關公共運輸設施則預計於今年七月完成並啓用。

運輸署已經與專營巴士營辦商因應科學園的園區發展情況進行商討，稍後將會因應乘客量靈活提升服務（例如加強九巴第272K號線的服務）。

（三）根據運輸署監察所見，現時服務科學園的專營巴士路線於最繁忙時段的最高載客率介乎約一成至約七成，顯示服務水平能夠應對乘客需求。整體而言，除專營巴士營辦商無法控制的情況外（例如惡劣天氣、突發的交通擠塞或其他事件引致班次延誤或脫班），專營巴士營辦商大致能依照編定的時間表提供服務。

服務科學園的專線小巴營辦商亦能按乘客需求，靈活調配資源加強服務。事實上，有關路線在繁忙時段的實際班次較編定班次更加頻密，以靈活應對該時段的乘客需求。

（四）科技園公司不時向租戶及商戶進行交通意見調查，最近一次調查於去年第三季進行，共收回超過一千份問卷，主要意見包括要求降低車費和增加班次。科技園公司會參考相關調查結果，以檢討科學園職員穿梭巴士的運作安排。

（五）正如上文所述，現時非繁忙時段設有六條專營巴士路線提供往返園區的服務。事實上，運輸署不時檢視園區的整體交通服務需求。舉例來說，為改善非繁忙時段的交通服務，運輸署於今年一月整合了兩條專營巴士路線（即第272A及272K號線）的資源，以提升非繁忙時段途經科學園接駁港鐵大學站的服務。運輸署會持續監察科學園的公共運輸服務運作情況，並根據乘客需求，適時與營辦商商討加強服務的方案。

（六）鑑於現時科學園職員穿梭巴士客量與最高許可載客量仍有相當距離，科技園公司現時未有計劃增加穿梭巴士的班次，但會密切監察穿梭巴士的營運情況及乘客量，因應實際需要和營運情況，優化穿梭巴士路線及班次。

（七）科學園園區內由二○一七年開始有經運輸署發出「車輛行駛許可證」的自動駕駛車輛（自動車）項目進行，測試自動車於本港應用的技術可行性，累積寶貴數據和經驗。政府於二○二四年推出新制訂的自動車規管框架，讓運輸署在確保道路安全的前提下為自動車測試提供彈性，提速提效促進更先進的自動車技術在本港測試和應用。至今，運輸署已分別向北大嶼山及西九文化區的自動駕駛測試項目發出兩張先導牌照，積極推動相關技術應用的躍進及協助業界推展有關項目，其中包括往來沙田香港科學園與港鐵大學站的自動駕駛小型巴士項目。此項目獲智慧交通基金資助，目前系統正在研發中，研發機構在完成研發、證明可安全運作並經運輸署審核後，預計可於明年第一季獲批先導牌照，隨後安排自動駕駛小型巴士在園區進行道路測試。該小型巴士的路線已在規劃中，預計途經港鐵大學站和科學園區內各大樓及主要設施，例如科技大道東的海濱廣場及科技大道西的企業廣場等。我們期望項目經測試後，能穩步優化和應用自動車技術，為園區及周邊社區提供更多便捷的交通選擇。"

Question:

According to the information of the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC), the working population in the Hong Kong Science Park (HKSP) has increased substantially from 13 500 to 24 000 over the past three years. Regarding the ancillary transport facilities for HKSP, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether comprehensive assessment and adjustment relating to the ancillary transport facilities in HKSP have been made by the authorities in the past three years in response to the growth of the working population in HKSP; if so, of the details; if not, whether such assessment and adjustment will be made;

(2) given that, according to the paper submitted by the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau and the Innovation and Technology Commission to the Panel on Commerce, Industry, Innovation and Technology of this Council on July 16 last year, the works of Batch 1 of Stage 2 of the Science Park Expansion Programme is expected to be completed in the first quarter of this year, whether the works have been completed, and of the details of the relevant additional transport planning support facilities;

(3) whether it has compiled statistics on whether the on-time performance of the public bus and minibus routes in HKSP is up to standard; if it has compiled the statistics and the outcome is in the negative, of the measures to improve the on-time performance of the relevant services;

(4) whether it knows if HKSTPC has regularly collected feedback from the people working in and business operators in HKSP on the ancillary transport facilities in HKSP; if HKSTPC has, of the details; if not, whether HKSTPC will make the relevant arrangements;

(5) as quite a number of people working in HKSP have relayed that they have wasted considerable time waiting for buses since the waiting time for a number of public bus routes in HKSP during non-peak hours is 15 to 30 minutes, whether the authorities will discuss with the franchised bus companies to increase bus service frequencies during non-peak hours;

(6) whether it knows if HKSTPC has considered increasing the shuttle bus service frequencies for staff members working in HKSP; and

(7) as it has been reported that the Transport Department is taking forward the project on automated light buses travelling between HKSP and the MTR University Station, whether the authorities have confirmed the specific implementation timetable for the project; of the routes of the automated light buses, and whether such routes will run through the various buildings and major facilities in HKSP, so as to facilitate mobility of the people working in and visitors to HKSP?

Reply:

President,

The Transport Department (TD) has been working closely with the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC) to closely monitor the transport demand of the Hong Kong Science Park (HKSP) with a view to planning suitable transportation facilities and services to facilitate the commuting of HKSP staff for work. Having consulted the TD, the Innovation and Technology Commission and HKSTPC, our reply to Professor the Hon William Wong's questions is as follows:

(1) To cater for the transportation needs of HKSP staff to commute to and from work, 20 franchised bus routes terminating or passing through HKSP are currently in service during the morning and evening peak hours on working days. Their service areas cover a wide range of districts across the Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories, including Sha Tin, North District, Tai Po, Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, Tsuen Wan, Kwai Tsing, Tseung Kwan O, Kwun Tong, Yau Tsim Mong, Wan Chai, Eastern District and Islands District (including the Airport). In addition, there are six franchised bus routes and five green minibus (GMB) routes providing whole-day feeder services during non-peak hours, which connect HKSP to the MTR University Station, MTR Shatin Station, Sha Tin and Ma On Shan.

The TD has all along been actively maintaining close liaison with the relevant public transport operators (PTOs) to timely adjust the services to and from HKSP in light of changes in passenger demand, so as to meet the travelling needs of passengers. In the past few years, having regard to the development of HKSP and its vicinity as well as changes in passenger demand, the TD has enhanced the transport services to and from HKSP upon discussion and co-ordination with PTOs. These include introducing new franchised bus routes, arranging for special departures and increasing services during peak hours. Details are set out at the Annex.

(2) Batch 1 of Stage 2 of the HKSP Expansion Programme involves the construction of a building primarily for wet laboratories (i.e. Building 18W), the construction of public transport facilities on the Science Park East Avenue, and improvement works at the junction of Science Park Road and Chong San Road. Relevant improvement works at the junction of Science Park Road and Chong San Road were completed and commissioned in December last year; the construction of Building 18W was completed in March 2025 and is expected to be commissioned in July 2025; while the public transport facilities are expected to be commissioned upon completion in July 2025.

The TD has discussed with franchised bus operators (FBOs) regarding the development of HKSP and will flexibly enhance the services in light of the patronage in due course (such as strengthening the service of KMB Route No. 272K).

(3) According to TD's observation, the highest occupancy rate of the current franchised bus routes serving HKSP during the busiest hours ranges from about 10 per cent to 70 per cent, illustrating that the service can meet the passenger demand. Overall speaking, FBOs have generally been able to provide services in accordance with the scheduled timetable except for circumstances beyond their control (such as delays and lost trips resulting from inclement weather, unexpected traffic congestion or other incidents).

GMB operators serving HKSP are able to deploy resources flexibly to enhance the services in response to passenger demand. In fact, the actual services of the routes concerned during peak hours are more frequent than scheduled to flexibly meet passenger demand during these periods.

(4) HKSTPC conducts transportation surveys with tenants and merchants from time to time. The latest survey was conducted in the third quarter of last year with more than 1 000 questionnaires collected. Major views included requests for lowering fares and increasing frequencies. HKSTPC will take into account relevant survey results in reviewing the operational arrangements for the employees' bus service of HKSP.

(5) As mentioned above, there are six franchised bus routes providing services to and from HKSP during non-peak hours. In fact, the TD reviews the overall demand for transportation services in HKSP from time to time. For instance, to improve the transportation services during non-peak hours, the TD rationalised the resources of two franchised bus routes (i.e. Route Nos. 272A and 272K) in January this year with a view to enhancing the off-peak services connecting HKSP to the MTR University Station. The TD will continue to monitor the operation of public transport services in HKSP and timely discuss with PTOs on service enhancement proposals having regard to the passenger demand.

(6) Given that the current patronage of the employees' bus service of HKSP is still far below its maximum carrying capacity, HKSTPC has no plans to increase the frequency of the shuttle bus service at present. Nonetheless, HKSTPC will closely monitor the operation and patronage of the shuttle bus service, and optimise the bus routes and frequencies based on actual needs and operating conditions.

(7) Since 2017, autonomous vehicle (AV) projects operating under Movement Permits issued by the TD have been conducting trials within HKSP. These trials aim to assess the technical feasibility of AV applications in Hong Kong while gathering valuable data and experience. In 2024, the Government introduced a new regulatory regime for AVs, enabling the TD to provide flexibility for AV trials while ensuring road safety, so as to foster the trials and application of more advanced AV technologies in Hong Kong. To date, the TD has issued two pilot licences for AV trials in North Lantau and the West Kowloon Cultural District, proactively driving advancements in the application of this technology and assisting the trade in taking forward the projects, including autonomous light buses running between HKSP in Sha Tin and the MTR University Station. Funded by the Smart Traffic Fund, this project is currently under development. Upon completion of the autonomous driving system development, demonstrating safe operation through the subsequent assessment by the TD, the research institution expects to conduct road trials at the public roads of HKSP after acquiring a pilot licence by the first quarter of 2026. The proposed route is already under planning and is expected to cover the MTR University Station and the major buildings/facilities within HKSP, including the Harbour View Square on Science Park East Avenue and the Enterprise Place on Science Park West Avenue. Upon successful completion of the trial projects, we anticipate that the AV technology can be progressively refined and implemented to offer enhanced transportation alternatives for both HKSP and neighbouring communities."
Buildings Energy Efficiency (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 to be gazetted on Friday,2025-06-18 11:00,2025-06-18 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061700263.htm,"The Buildings Energy Efficiency (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 (the Ordinance) and its Buildings Energy Efficiency (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 (Commencement) Notice (the Notice) will be published in the Gazette on Friday (June 20).

A spokesman for the Environment and Ecology Bureau said, ""The Ordinance not only improves the buildings energy efficiency management regime of Hong Kong by extending the scope of energy efficiency regulation to more types of buildings, shortening the intervals of energy audits and disclosing technical information in energy audit reports, but also helps to achieve a win-win scenario of saving electricity costs for buildings, reducing carbon emissions, and boosting the development of the green economy, thereby assisting Hong Kong to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.""

The Ordinance will come into effect in two stages. The Notice will be tabled by the Government before the Legislative Council at its sitting on June 25. Upon the completion of negative vetting, the amendments for updating the qualifications eligible for registration as Registered Energy Assessors will commence first on September 20, 2025 (i.e. three months after the gazettal of the Ordinance), to enable professionals' early registration. The remaining provisions will commence on September 20, 2026 (i.e. 15 months after the gazettal of the Ordinance), to allow adequate time for the sectors to make necessary preparations for compliance with the new regulations. The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department will continue the promotion and publicity efforts to inform building owners of the latest statutory requirements in a timely manner, and provide technical support to assist them in complying with the new requirements.

The spokesman added, ""Upon the full implementation of the Ordinance, it is estimated that an additional 500 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of about 150 000 three-person households, could be saved in 2035."""
