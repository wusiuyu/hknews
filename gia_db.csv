政府加緊處理皇后山邨及山麗苑食水事件（附圖／短片）,2025-06-07 20:57,2025-06-07 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/07/P2025060700798.htm,"政府高度關注皇后山邨及山麗苑食水事件，相關政策局及部門在財政司副司長黃偉綸監督下已從速展開工作，跟進行政長官昨日（六月六日）召開高層督導會議後提出的四項指示，以落實十項具體工作。

政府已成立由食水安全諮詢委員會（委員會）三名專家組成的專家組，成員包括委員會主席陳漢輝博士、鍾志明及陳紫鳴，會繼續就事件的溯源工作提供意見，確保調查結果科學及客觀。

發展局局長甯漢豪今日（六月七日）聯同水務署署長黃恩諾及專家組三名成員前往為皇后山邨及山麗苑供水的喉管網絡之上游位置，分別視察濾網及到喉管位置了解稍後進行的工作。政府向專家組交代判斷，即位於供水系統上游坪輋路一段使用瀝青作為內壁保護塗層的長約400米、直徑600毫米的供水鋼喉管，相信是皇后山邨及山麗苑水中沉積物的源頭。專家組認為此判斷合理。

水務署會繼續深化溯源工作，利用機械人等先進科技，探測該段喉管內瀝青塗層的情況，以進一步確認事件的具體原因，並會在兩星期內將事件調查報告送交委員會覆核。

發展局局長表示水務署會率先更換該涉事上游以瀝青作為內壁保護塗層的400米長供水鋼喉管，於今年內開展工程，署方會立即開始準備工作。目前全港百分之九十以上的水管並非以瀝青作內壁保護塗層。至於使用瀝青作為內壁保護塗層的700公里長供水喉管，水務署已在合適位置安裝超過1 000個水管濾網，並會因應「風險為本」的原則，檢視是否需要在其他位置額外加裝水管濾網。水務署會擬定長遠更換水管的計劃，提交發展局審視。

加緊溯源的同時，水務署亦會加密驗水，每日從皇后山邨（共七座大廈、一座社區中心、一座商場）及山麗苑（共六座大廈）的水缸抽取水樣本進行化驗，嚴密監測水質，並會每天在水務署網頁發布測試結果。為確保居民可安心用水，水務署會繼續安排水箱為該屋邨及屋苑作臨時供水。此外，水務署會即時處理收到的查詢（水務署24小時熱線：2824 5000）。當區民政事務專員會與水務署及房屋署加強聯繫，如接獲居民投訴，會即時跟進。

房屋署已安排在未來一星期，再一次全面清洗皇后山邨及山麗苑每一座樓宇的食水缸。署方亦已在皇后山邨及山麗苑全部13座樓宇的每一座地面入水口，加設共22個高效能過濾設施，並會每天檢查兩次，確保運作正常。以上措施的支出會由政府承擔。

房屋署會將水務署每天公布的水樣本測試結果，張貼於皇后山邨及山麗苑每座大廈的大堂，每日更新。⁠如居民發現水質有任何問題，可隨時致電皇后山邨屋邨辦事處（電話號碼：2537 0001）或山麗苑屋苑辦事處（電話號碼：2713 9530）。辦事處會根據居民提供的電話，聯絡他們以安排職員上門了解情況及跟進處理。

民政及青年事務局（民青局）和民政事務總署（民政總署）過去一星期聯同區議員及關愛隊義工，進行超過100次探訪及收集個案轉介等工作，時刻以實際行動關心皇后山邨及山麗苑的食水事件對居民生活的影響。

在今明兩日，民青局和民政總署將召集區議員、北區三會成員及北區六個關愛隊小隊超過50人，聯同房屋署人員進行探訪，包括曾就事件作出求助的個案在內的住戶，持續跟進居民用水情況，並在有需要時即時轉介。今日的探訪已成功接觸超過850個住戶，大部分住戶反映水質已有顯著改善。另外，皇后山邨及山麗苑各主要位置亦會設置三個街站，為居民提供最新消息及有用資訊，以及接受居民個案登記。"

​發展局局長及食水安全諮詢委員會主席會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-06-07 19:11,2025-06-07 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/07/P2025060700725.htm,"發展局局長甯漢豪、水務署署長黃恩諾及食水安全諮詢委員會專家組今日（六月七日）下午視察皇后山邨及山麗苑供水網絡後會見傳媒。以下是甯漢豪及食水安全諮詢委員會主席陳漢輝博士與傳媒的談話內容：

發展局局長：各位傳媒朋友，大家好，知道大家在這裏等了一會兒。就皇后山邨和山麗苑的事件，大家都知道昨天行政長官召開了高層督導會議，亦提出了十項跟進工作，要求我們落實。其中一個工作就是關於溯源的工作，因為大家都知道即使現在皇后山邨和山麗苑內的食水出現瀝青沉澱物的情況，經過我們多日來的清洗，其實是大有改善，但是我們始終都要做一個溯源，即是找出今次這些瀝青黑點的源頭在哪裏。我們要科學地做好溯源工作，希望從事件中學習，避免同類事件發生。

昨天行政長官提出要求我們做的十項工作，其中一樣是希望我們成立一個專家小組，去協助和監察政府做這個溯源工作，所以我今日非常感謝食水安全諮詢委員會主席陳漢輝博士，以及委員會的兩位成員，亦是屋宇裝備包括喉管裝備的專家工程師，分別是陳紫鳴工程師及鍾志明工程師，聯同我一起來這裏視察，日後主席和兩位專家都會繼續協助和監察我們做溯源工作。我希望做完這個工作之後，約兩星期左右的時間，將我們得到的初步報告，正式提交食水安全諮詢委員會作覆核。

剛才我們跟幾位專家講解了，水務署署長其實幾日前公開地交代了我們的一個判斷，究竟源頭是在哪裏。或者我讓署長拿着一幅圖，我容易跟大家講。當時署長已經公開講解過，我們今日都用一幅圖，因為剛才我們都是用這幅圖和我們的專家講解。這裏是皇后山邨和山麗苑，如果是供水到皇后山邨和山麗苑的水管，就是大家見到這條管線，其實全段只有紅色這段、大約400米長的水管仍在其塗層上有用瀝青塗層，所以整條水管現時只有這一段仍有瀝青塗層的水管，所以我們有理由相信，今次食水中出現的瀝青沉澱物應該是來自這一段。

另一個我們一直以來的判斷，就是這些瀝青剝落了而沖入去皇后山邨地帶，並非近日，或者我們近期收到這些投訴之前出現。為甚麼呢？因為大家見到這裏有兩個綠色的位置，其實我們在二○二二、二三年左右已經安裝了濾網。剛才我們也和專家去了這個濾網看。這些濾網，其實水務署過去每一個星期都會來查驗。其實就皇后山邨事件，我們收到投訴之前的整個月，他們出去的檢查，這兩個濾網都是並無異樣的。即是我們相信，如果有一些瀝青沖下來，就不是近期沖下來的。我們相信是未有這些濾網之前，即是二二、二三年之前，我們安裝濾網的時候，已經沖了進來，沉澱了在裏面的水管。而署長也解釋了，隨着屋邨有多些人入伙，水壓、水流增加，可能開始陸續打散沉澱物。今日我們與幾位專家現場交代了我們這個評估，專家大體都認同我們這個判斷是有其合理性。

當然，溯源是很科學的工作，我經常都說。除了我們這樣判斷，即使是專家認同，我們都希望切法走到水管裏，看看現時裏面瀝青塗層剝落的情況是怎樣，令我們這個推斷更加紮實。剛才我們都跟專家講解了，要走進去，我們要利用科技，我們要利用機械人的技術。剛才都聽到工程人員跟我們說，如果用這個技術，都可以在不擾民的情況下，可以做到這個檢測。正如我剛才說我們希望我們做完這個檢測，看到裏面的情況，我們大約在兩個星期左右的時間，希望可以向食水安全諮詢委員會提交我們的報告。

另外也想向大家交代一下，昨日在特首談的十項措施內，都有提到這段有瀝青塗層的喉管，我們都會率先將它更換，因為雖然我們現時都有些濾網在此，發揮到阻隔作用，但是為了釋除公眾疑慮，特別因為這裏真的出現過一些沉澱物，所以我們現時的計劃都是希望在今年之內，開展這個更換工程。至於全港其實還有大約700公里的水管也有這種瀝青塗層，但我要強調瀝青塗層是國際上很多水管都有用的，它本身並非有害，只不過當它有時剝落或老舊，可能都會影響水的觀感，因此我們要裝濾網。現時在這700公里長的水管附近的範圍，大家可以放心，我們已經裝了超過1 000個濾網，已經是從前安裝的，而這些濾網，水務署會定時檢測。正如昨日行政長官也在其公布提到，我們也會和水務署看看還需不需要加裝，作為額外的風險管理，這是一方面。另一方面，其實我早幾日也向大家交代過，我們也要求水務署向發展局提交一個更換老舊水管計劃，我相信自然水務署在這個提交予我們的計劃內，都會關顧這些還有瀝青塗層的水管，他們的計劃是如何，到時發展局會審視，我們看看資源配置，按部就班。為何要按部就班，大家今日來到現場都知道，如果要換一個水管，不是這麼簡單，始終可能會阻礙行人路，可能會阻礙交通，而更換水管，我們說的是很多個月的時間，即不是說幾個星期可以完成，所以的確是要按部就班去做。或者我今日談到這裏，我交給陳漢輝主席與大家談談他今日看到的和專家的看法。

食水安全諮詢委員會主席：多謝局長剛才的介紹。各位傳媒朋友，大家好，我是食水安全諮詢委員會主席陳漢輝。我今日很高興有機會在局長及水務署署長帶領下，實地檢視這喉管的情況。從剛才所見，專家小組十分認同局長所說。政府的溯源方向，我們認為很合理和科學化，因為這樣可以從多方面得知源頭在哪裡，譬如我們知道這些塗層剝落是一些瀝青物料，而在居民水喉亦看到這些物料，兩者比較之下，證實是一些類似的物料，我們很有信心這個方向正確，所以這個溯源方向我們認為是需要做的。

我亦有一些意見給予政府，專家小組認為有「三步曲」要進行。第一步，先清理現時每座大廈的內部喉管和水缸──地下水缸及天台水缸，看看喉管內還有沒有這些黑色物料或者藍綠物料，因為這影響居民飲用。我知道水務署和房屋署連日來清理喉管和水缸，以及在地下水缸入口前加裝濾網，這能確保進入每一座大廈的水都不會再有這些瀝青塗層碎料，讓居民可以放心安心，這是第一步。

第二步，專家小組認為可能在二○二二年十月前，有些塗料碎料由剛才局長介紹的那段400米管道流入山麗苑和皇后山邨的地下管道。那些地下管道，我知悉是很大的管道，當初可能水流量細，物料未必可以所謂「炒起」或沖洗，當人口增加，水流量大，這些物料自然會不斷湧現，所以可以解釋為何這些物料似乎近期才出現而以前沒有。我認為這是個比較合理的解釋。我們認為皇后山邨和山麗苑地下管道的大管道內，可能有部分仍有這些物料存在，所以第二步工作我認為要清洗這些地下管道內積累的沉積物。這項清洗，我知道政府或水務署會安排日內做，但要確保真正清洗乾淨，因為我知道那些喉管可能很多地方彎彎曲曲，亦有些低位，可能有些沉積物堆積在這些地方，未必沖洗得乾淨，所以我強烈建議政府用剛才局長所說的管道機械人去探索一下，審視一下，以確保沖洗效果做得好。因為如果沖洗後都不知道行不行，那就不行，所以都會有些科學證據證明洗得乾淨，我認為這是第二步。

第三步，我認為剛才局長說，從一個中長遠的角度，是需要更換一些有問題的水管，這可以確保清除污染源頭。因為如果我們確定現時找到瀝青物料源頭在那裏，為甚麼不清理它呢？所以認為這也要盡快，即是政府資源範圍或者工程範圍許可，應該盡量盡快將這段更換，之後就可以徹底消除所有污染源頭，讓居民在這裏住得安心，住得放心。

至於仍看見一些藍綠物質，我都認同政府的看法，是一些閘掣塗層。我了解到他們短期內會檢視，這是區內問題，與外面無關，要檢視這些喉管閘掣有沒有剝落情況，或者需要更換。我認為做了這些工夫後，應該很快會看到山麗苑和皇后山邨的食水再一次清晰。多謝各位。

記者：為何不立刻更換那700米喉管，取出後再化驗會否更好？另外今日難得來到，為何不入區看看居民的處理情況？會否覺得水務署署長之前的解說未必可以令居民釋除疑慮，所以今次要特地落區再看清楚？

發展局局長：首先，每逢這些事件，居民要安心放心，政府的確是要不停解說，我們亦都樂意去做，所以不會是單一次解說便算。而今次我們來到現場的目的，主要是跟溯源的工作有關，因為邨裏的情況現時已經有很多很大的改善，無論是房屋署、民政事務處、關愛隊等等，都幫我們一直收集市民反應，我們今日的重點是與專家到現場做溯源工作。

至於你剛才說這段有瀝青塗層的水管，在這個位置的400米長水管，為何不馬上更換呢，剛才提到，我們今年內會開展工程。如果你說香港其餘仍有這些瀝青塗層的水管，首先，我要強調瀝青塗層的水管本身不會令到它不安全，它都是安全的，但是如果老舊了，那些瀝青比較容易剝落，可能我們就要靠很多濾網的工夫，亦有時候水中如果有這些物料，大家觀感上不安心，所以我們遲早都要更換，但我們認為都要按優次，無論是甚麼水管都好，塗層是怎樣都好，水管老舊了就要按優次，但不能全部同一時間更換。大家試想一下對於交通、民生的影響，總是要有一個排序。無論如何，發展局已經請水務署提交一個方案給我們，我們會審視，然後在內部配置合理的資源。

記者：剛剛說今年內開始換喉，而非下個月，中間是否有些甚麼困難，所以要今年內才做到而非下個月？那是否表示居民還要再等多半年？還有想知道換喉管時有沒有說多久時間要停水？最後想關注黑點的問題，居民都很關注，那究竟甚麼時候才可以完全沒有一些黑點，會否可以提供一個時間表出來？

發展局局長：因為我們現時每一天，水務署都有在其網頁公布驗水結果，在驗水結果中，大家上網都看到，它會提及在水內有沒有這些黑點，所以現時每一天，在每一座大廈，在這個屋苑的範圍，每一座大廈抽出來驗水，如果有黑點，大家一定會知道，連日來驗出來是沒有的。當然我們現時還有一些個別的住戶告訴我們還有一些黑點，我們不排除可能是過去藏在水喉內，因為這個事件都有一段時間，但是事實就是我們近日，無論從屋邨辦事處、屋苑辦事處和區議員回饋給我們的意見，其實個案是少了很多，只有很零星的個案，就算是有，進屋看其實那個黑點已經是非常小量，所以我們有信心，隨着再過多幾日，應該是會更加好轉。但是起碼現時每一日在水缸抽，已經沒有這些黑點，很清楚，我們將那個數據已放到網上。

至於你說400米長的水管，為何我要說今年之內呢，任何工程都要籌劃，不是說明天開始就開始。如果真的在這個行人路，以致影響到我們旁邊，現時這裏有很多車行走的行車線，我想大家都要理解，我們是要部署的，亦要與社區、區議會有溝通，與警方交通部有溝通。所以我剛才說，我們一定會在今年之內開展工程，但接下來這段時間就要做這些部署。

記者：今次是否反應過慢？居民要整個星期，然後才減少個案，會否覺得今次當局反應有些慢，未及時處理這件事？

發展局局長：如果我沒有記錯，水務署是在五月三十日收到一些個案的報告，其實它已即時取水化驗，但是無論如何，一些沉澱物積聚在這裡，的確需要一些時間沖洗。當然，回想起來，會不會我們可以早些出來跟大家解釋我們接下來的行動，或早些拿一些黑色沉澱物作化驗，這些地方回想起來，我們認為在時間性上，的確可以把握得好一點。但無論如何，現時一定要知道，情況已經受控，好轉了很多，這是事實。我們正努力進行溯源工作，亦正為更換這個水管作出安排。多謝各位。"

Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected ketamine worth about $5.3 million at airport (with photo),2025-06-07 19:03,2025-06-07 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/07/P2025060700704.htm,"âHong Kong Customs yesterday (June 6) detected a drug trafficking case involving baggage concealment at Hong Kong International Airport and seized about 13 kilograms of suspected ketamine with an estimated market value of about $5.3 million, as well as 69 sticks of illicit cigarette.

A male passenger, aged 18, arrived in Hong Kong from Brussels, Belgium via Dubai, the United Arab Emirates yesterday. During Customs clearance, Customs officers found about 13 kg of suspected ketamine in his check-in suitcase and 69 sticks of illicit cigarette from his carry-on bag. The man was subsequently arrested.

The arrested man has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug and one count of possession of dutiable goods. The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on June 9.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, any person who imports, possesses, sells or buys dutiable commodities without a valid licence commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

創新科技及工業局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-06-07 16:05,2025-06-07 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/07/P2025060700576.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（六月七日）出席博鰲亞洲論壇國際科技與創新論壇2025年香港會議香港專場論壇後會見傳媒的談話內容：

創新科技及工業局局長：各位香港市民、各位傳媒朋友，大家中午好。歡迎大家關注博鰲亞洲論壇國際科技與創新論壇2025年香港會議。本屆香港會議是以「以科技引領未來創新驅動轉型」為主題，匯聚了超過1 500名來自世界各地的專家、學者、政經領袖以及青年代表，大家共同探討國際創科發展的趨勢，以及前沿科技領域的機遇與挑戰。

​整個論壇昨天已經開始。今天上午，我們剛剛成功舉辦了全體大會，以及香港專場。今年的香港專場，是以「發揮內聯外通的優勢拓展環球創科合作」為主題，今天稍後我們還會舉辦其他五場分論壇，分別聚焦人工智能、投資資本、未來出行、科技治理，以及可持續發展等前沿課題。

​我相信這次博鰲亞洲論壇國際科技與創新論壇2025年香港會議在香港成功舉辦，將有助於香港從全世界吸引優秀的產業和人才來到香港、來到區域去發展，加速香港國際創新科技中心的建設，同時能夠對整個區域的經濟發展貢獻香港的智慧和力量。

​下面我願意回答記者朋友們提出的問題。

記者：香港新設100億元基金，撬動社會資本，如何避免「政府熱，市場冷」的問題？香港風險投資偏好短期收益項目，如何吸引資本投向回報周期長的硬科技呢？

創新科技及工業局局長：香港在建設國際創新科技中心的過程中，投資是非常重要的領域。剛才進行的香港專場，我們正聚焦「政、產、學、研、投」怎麼樣高效合作，特區政府提出要建立創科產業引導基金，拿出100億元來，我們希望吸引各界人士能夠把錢放在這裏，大家共同投資香港未來產業發展。在資金的運營過程中，政府的作用就是搭好台、定好目標、定好框架、定好規矩。我們希望充分發揮業界的力量，把基金辦好，能夠扶持更多的高科技產業在香港發展。

記者：我有兩個問題，第一個是，預期下半年供市民使用的「港話通」的開發進度是怎樣呢，可以在市民的甚麼生活環節、領域中能夠用到呢？這是第一個問題。然後，第二個問題是「港法通」、「港環通」也是正在研發當中，想請問一下，以上會跟甚麼政府部門聯通數據，開發進度也是怎麼樣？測試的過程裏面，準確度能否達到局方的預期？

創新科技及工業局局長：這位記者朋友非常關心由HKGAI（香港生成式人工智能研發中心）研發的，我們自主的大語言基礎模型，以及相關應用在香港推廣的工作。首先這位記者關心的是「港話通」如何推出，我可以高興的告訴大家，現在相關團隊正在加緊準備，我們力爭在今年下半年就會成功的推出「港話通」，特別是我們手機的版本，給香港市民使用，我們這個工作正在加緊進行，稍後會有詳細的公布。有一點我可以肯定的告訴你，今年下半年香港市民一定會用到我們香港自己的大語言基礎模型，大家可以比較一下與Open AI的ChatGPT、與我們國家的DeepSeek，大家不妨去比較一下。

​第二個問題是關於「港法通」、「港會通」等，這些都是在我們之前研發的香港大語言模型基礎下開發的應用功能，比如說「港法通」主要是在法律界所應用的AI大語言模型，「港會通」主要是用於部門，比如說我們開會、記錄等等這些相關功能。這些技術上基本上都已經完成了，下一步是怎樣讓它能夠更好的去加以應用。你剛才說的用到哪些資源和數據？在這香港大語言模型開發的過程中，香港各界提供了很多幫助，特別是數據。比如說我們政府的數據、立法會的數據，我們很多新聞媒體的數據，都幫助我們這樣一個大語言模型的成功開發，推廣出來。我相信日後，我們還會繼續在建立自己數據庫的工作上，會繼續做得更多，做得更好。謝謝大家。"

Under the theme of
""Transitioning Towards the Future: Powered by Science, Technology and Innovation"", the conference attracted some 800 leading experts, academics and political and economic leaders from the Mainland and overseas to gather in Hong Kong for an in-depth exchange and sharing of experience, and to explore how to capitalise on Hong Kong's unique advantage of being connected to the Mainland and the outside world and how to foster global co-operation in the field of innovation and technology (I&T).

Fully recognising Hong Kong's advantage of being highly internationalised and as the gateway to both China and the world, the ISTIF was held in Hong Kong for the first time.

In the Opening Plenary held today (June 7), presided by the Secretary-General of the Boao Forum for Asia, Mr Zhang Jun; Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the President of the ISTIF, Mr Edmund Ho; the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee; the Chairman of the Boao Forum for Asia Board of Directors, Mr Ban Ki-moon; former Prime Minister of Finland and the Honourary Chairman of the ISTIF, Mr Esko Aho; former President of Slovenia, Mr Danilo Türk; Deputy Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Mr Liu Guangyuan; and former Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Thailand, Mr Don Pramudwinai, delivered speeches to unveil the Hong Kong Forum which was held right after the plenary.

Speaking at the plenary, Mr Lee stated that under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong is the only world city that enjoys both the China advantage and the global advantage. He said that Hong Kong would take full advantage of its established tradition of the rule of law, world-class universities and robust intellectual property protection regime in its development into an international innovation and technology centre.

Mr Lee added that the world stands at the consequential crossroads in human history, and the convergence of artificial intelligence and health technology will not only serve as tools, but also lead to humanity's evolution into the next era of development.

DH continues to clamp down on illegal waterpipe smoking in no smoking areas (with photos),2025-06-07 14:01,2025-06-07 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/07/P2025060700479.htm,"The Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the Department of Health (DH) continued to clamp down on illegal waterpipe smoking in no smoking areas by conducting another enforcement operation, codenamed ""Pipepurge"", in Central last night (June 6) and issued a total of five fixed penalty notices (FPNs).

  During the operation, officers from TACO (including plainclothes officers) carried out inspections and enforcement action at one bar in Central, and issued a total of five FPNs to persons illegally smoking waterpipes. TACO's investigation is ongoing, and prosecution may also be taken against operators of the bar who are suspected of aiding and abetting smoking offences. TACO will also refer the cases to the Liquor Licensing Board for appropriate follow-up action.

  Under the Ordinance, conducting a smoking act in a statutory no smoking area (such as indoor areas of bars or restaurants) is prohibited. Any person doing a smoking act in statutory no smoking areas is liable to a fixed penalty of $1,500. Moreover, where smoking products (including waterpipes) are sold, in bars or otherwise, the restrictions on the promotion and sale of smoking products stipulated in the Ordinance apply. Offenders are liable on summary conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000. Venue managers of statutory no smoking areas are empowered by the Ordinance to request a smoking offender cease the act; if the offender is not co-operative, the manager may contact the Police for assistance.

  In addition, under the Criminal Procedure Ordinance, any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission by another person of any offence shall be guilty of the same offence.

  ""The DH will continue to closely monitor and take stringent enforcement action against illegal waterpipe smoking. Last year (2024), TACO conducted 162 operations against illegal waterpipe smoking activities in no smoking areas. A total of 162 FPNs were issued against smoking offenders, while 89 summonses were issued to staff members and operators of the bars/restaurants for other related offences,"" the Head of TACO, Dr Manny Lam said.

  Dr Lam reminded the public that waterpipe is a smoking product, and its combustion of fuel (e.g. charcoal) releases carbon monoxide. Exposure to a low concentration of carbon monoxide can lead to a range of symptoms such as dizziness, headache, tiredness and nausea; whereas exposure to a high concentration of carbon monoxide can lead to impaired vision, disturbed co-ordination, unconsciousness, brain damage or even death. People should seek medical attention immediately if they suspect they are developing symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning.

  A typical one-hour waterpipe smoking session exposes the user to 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke inhaled from a single conventional cigarette. Moreover, sharing a waterpipe apparatus increases the risk of transmitting infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis.

  He cautioned against waterpipe smoking and the use of other smoking products. Smokers should quit smoking as early as possible for their own health and that of others. For more information on the hazards of waterpipe smoking, please visit www.livetobaccofree.hk/pdfs/waterpipe_leaflet_new.pdf."
衞生署繼續嚴厲打擊禁煙區吸食水煙違法活動（附圖）,2025-06-07 14:01,2025-06-07 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/07/P2025060700477.htm,"衞生署控煙酒辦公室（控煙酒辦）繼續嚴厲打擊禁煙區非法吸食水煙違法活動，昨晚（六月六日）派員到中環進行代號「菸滅」的行動，共發出五張定額罰款通知書。

行動中，控煙酒辦人員（包括便裝人員）到中環一間酒吧巡查和執法，向非法吸食水煙的人士發出五張定額罰款通知書。調查仍在進行，控煙酒辦會考慮向涉嫌協助及教唆吸煙罪行的酒吧經營者提出檢控，亦會將個案轉介酒牌局，以作適當跟進。

《條例》禁止任何人於法定禁煙區（例如酒吧或食肆的室內區域）作出吸煙行為。任何人於法定禁煙區作出吸煙行為即屬違法，可被處定額罰款1,500元。另外，如有出售任何吸煙產品（包括水煙），不論是在酒吧或其他處所，須遵守《條例》對推廣和銷售吸煙產品的限制。違例者一經簡易程序定罪，最高可被罰款五萬元。《條例》亦授權法定禁煙區的管理人可要求違例吸煙者停止有關的吸煙行為；如違例者不合作，可要求警方協助。

此外，根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》，任何人協助、教唆、慫使或促致另一人犯任何罪行，即屬就同一罪行有罪。

控煙酒辦主任林民聰醫生說：「衞生署會繼續密切監察及嚴厲執法，以打擊非法吸食水煙活動。去年（二○二四年），控煙酒辦共採取162次針對在禁煙區非法吸食水煙的行動、向違例吸煙者發出162張定額罰款通知書，及向違反其他相關罪行的店員及酒吧／食肆負責人發出89張傳票。」

林民聰醫生提醒市民，水煙是吸煙產品，它所用的助燃物（如煤炭）在燃燒時會產生一氧化碳。曝露於低濃度一氧化碳的人士可能出現頭暈、頭痛、疲倦和噁心等症狀；而曝露於高濃度一氧化碳的人士則可能出現視覺受損、協調紊亂、失去知覺和腦部受損等症狀，甚至死亡。市民如懷疑出現一氧化碳中毒症狀，應立即求醫。

吸食一小時水煙的煙霧吸入量，可達一根傳統捲煙的100至200倍。同時，共用水煙器具會增加水煙使用者感染結核病等傳染病的風險。

他忠告市民，不要吸食水煙或使用其他吸煙產品，並呼籲吸煙人士為個人及他人健康着想，盡快戒煙。更多有關吸食水煙對健康的危害，可參考以下連結：www.livetobaccofree.hk/pdfs/waterpipe_leaflet_new.pdf。"
"Opening remarks by SITI at Hong Kong Forum of International Science, Technology and Innovation Forum of Boao Forum for Asia 2025 Hong Kong Conference (English only) (with photo)",2025-06-07 13:23,2025-06-07 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/07/P2025060700420.htm,"Following are the opening remarks by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, at Hong Kong Forum of International Science, Technology and Innovation Forum of Boao Forum for Asia 2025 Hong Kong Conference today (June 7):

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is both a privilege and a pleasure to stand before you today to open the Hong Kong Forum of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) International Science, Technology and Innovation Forum 2025 Hong Kong Conference.

Hong Kong is more than a vibrant cosmopolitan city - it is a dynamic bridge connecting Mainland China and rest of the world, a melting pot of ideas, and a powerhouse of innovation. Over the past few years, we have put in tremendous effort and resources to transform Hong Kong into a thriving hub for innovation and technology (I&T).

As we saw in the video, we have launched a series of robust policies to solidify Hong Kong's research capabilities, accelerate the transformation of R&D (research and development) outcomes, and promote the development of the technology industry, aiming to build a complete I&T ecological chain encompassing the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors while promoting interactive collaboration across government, industry, academia, research, and investment sectors. These efforts turn breakthroughs into impact, and ideas into global solutions.

Our motherland's unwavering support empowers Hong Kong to shine on the international stage. Under the ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong remains the most international city in the country, offering a unique blend of East and West. Here, world-class infrastructure, robust legal and intellectual protection systems, and vibrant financial and capital markets converge. Talents gather, ideas flourish, entrepreneurial spirit blossoms, and enterprises grow. Being home to five world's top 100 universities, Hong Kong is a magnet for brilliant minds, fostering collaboration that spans borders and disciplines, and proudly developing into an international I&T centre.

And the best is yet to come. The Hetao Hong Kong Park (Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone) and the San Tin Technopole are set to be the game changers, offering unparalleled opportunities for innovators at home and afar. To the global I&T community: Hong Kong is your ideal gateway to venture into the vast markets of Mainland China and Asia.

Today's theme, ""Leveraging the Advantages of Connecting with Both the Mainland and the World to Foster Global Innovation and Technology Collaboration"", perfectly captures our vision. Hong Kong is not just a player in the global I&T landscape – we are a catalyst for change, a facilitator of collaboration, a driver of progress, and a value-adder of advancement.

We are honoured to have esteemed leaders from industry, academia, research, and investment sectors joining the panel discussion today, whose insights, I am sure, will illuminate how Hong Kong can further strengthen its unique role in advancing global I&T collaboration. Together, we can unlock new possibilities and create a brighter future for all.

Before I close, let me extend my heartfelt gratitude to the BFA for co-organising this event, and our strategic partner, HKTDC (Hong Kong Trade Development Council), for their staunch support. A special thank goes to my colleagues at the Bureau and ITC (Innovation and Technology Commission) for their hard work over the past months in making this forum possible.

Ladies and gentlemen, the future of innovation is here, and it starts in Hong Kong. Let's seize this moment to collaborate, create, and inspire. I wish you all a fruitful and inspiring day. Thank you."
SJ's address at Ceremony for Admission of New Senior Counsel (English only),2025-06-07 12:22,2025-06-07 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/07/P2025060700363.htm,"  The following is the address by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the Ceremony for the Admission of the New Senior Counsel today (June 7):

Chief Justice, members of the Judiciary, Chairman of the Bar (Hong Kong Bar Association), President of the Law Society (Law Society of Hong Kong), fellow members of the legal profession, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 On behalf of the Department of Justice, I wish to extend my warmest congratulations to the three new silks: Ms Catrina Lam, Ms Priscilia Lam and Mr Timothy Parker. Their appointments as Senior Counsel are undoubtedly well deserved.

 I have to confess that I had a mixed feeling upon seeing their names in the press release of the Judiciary. On the one hand, I noted at once that the family name of two of the appointees is ""Lam"" (æ). I am, naturally, very proud and pleased that the ""Lams"" seem to be doing quite well in the legal field. Other prominent examples would include eminent members of the Judiciary such as Johnson Lam PJ and Godfrey Lam JA. On the other hand, I was a bit concerned that this is second year in a row that there are more female appointees than male!

 Catrina has a very successful practice mainly in the area of commercial and competition law. For those of you who know the Chinese names of Catrina and me, apart from having the same family name, the second character is also identical i.e. ""å®"". Very shortly after the Judiciary's announcement, I received a WeChat message from a lawyer friend on the Mainland asking very seriously whether Catrina is my younger sister!

 Priscilia, as we all know, specialises in criminal law. The Department of Justice has instructed her to prosecute in many important criminal cases. When I was preparing this speech, I asked one of my colleagues in the Prosecution Division whether there is anything funny or interesting that I can say about Priscilia. To my disappointment, the answer that I received is that ""Sorry, I tried and tried, scratched my head, but I just can't think of anything funny."" Perhaps I have not asked the right person. Anyhow, it is well known that Priscilia is very sporty; and is very good at kick boxing, snowboarding and wake surfing. At one point, I was very tempted to consult Zervos JA, who is, as we all know, the dear husband of Priscilia, on the level of her kick boxing skills as he might have some first-hand experience but, on reflection, that did not appear to be a good idea at all!

 As to Timothy, he has a general civil practice and is particularly recognised for his expertise in public law and constitutional matters. I was told that his son, Graham, was born last month. So, coupled with his appointment as Senior Counsel, this is what we would say in Chinese: ""éåè¨é"", double happiness.

 Apart from today's ceremony, there were two other significant legal events in the past week or so. First, last Wednesday, the Legislative Council approved the appointment of Sir William Young, an eminent former judge of the Supreme Court of New Zealand, as a foreign non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal. Second, about a week ago on May 30, 33 countries including China signed the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation in Hong Kong. Representatives from around other 40 countries and 20 international organisations also attended the ceremony. These encouraging developments demonstrate that Hong Kong's status as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre is strongly supported and acknowledged by our country and the international community.

 Hong Kong's success in this respect so far is attributed to our common law system, which is indeed one of the most important and distinctive advantages enjoyed by Hong Kong under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". While we must do our best to preserve and enhance the essential features and core values of our common law system, it is vital not to overlook many challenges ahead. Senior Counsel, as leaders of our strong and independent bar, are expected and required to play proactive and leading roles in overcoming these challenges. For the present purpose, I would like to mention three of them.

The first challenge is how to use technological innovations to promote efficiency, but without compromising the integrity, of judicial proceedings. I wish to quote from an English decision handed down yesterday in Ayinde, R (On the Application of) v Qatar National Bank QPSC & Anor [2025] EWHC 1383 (Admin) ""Artificial intelligence is a tool that carries with it risks as well as opportunities. Its use must take place therefore with an appropriate degree of oversight, and within a regulatory framework that ensures compliance with well-established professional and ethical standards if public confidence in the administration of justice is to be maintained… In the context of legal research, the risks of using artificial intelligence are now well known. Freely available generative artificial intelligence tools, trained on a large language model such as ChatGPT are not capable of conducting reliable legal research. Such tools can produce apparently coherent and plausible responses to prompts, but those coherent and plausible responses may turn out to be entirely incorrect. The responses may make confident assertions that are simply untrue. They may cite sources that do not exist. They may purport to quote passages from a genuine source that do not appear in that source. Those who use artificial intelligence to conduct legal research notwithstanding these risks have a professional duty therefore to check the accuracy of such research…There are serious implications for the administration of justice and public confidence in the justice system if artificial intelligence is misused. In those circumstances, practical and effective measures must now be taken by those within the legal profession with individual leadership responsibilities (such as heads of chambers and managing partners) and by those with the responsibility for regulating the provision of legal services. Those measures must ensure that every individual currently providing legal services within this jurisdiction (whenever and wherever they were qualified to do so) understands and complies with their professional and ethical obligations and their duties to the court if using artificial intelligence.” It is clear that these important remarks apply equally to Hong Kong.

 The second challenge is how to enhance the synergy between our common law system and the Mainland legal system under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". To maintain Hong Kong's unique attractiveness as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" between China and the rest of the world in the provision of legal and dispute resolution services, it is essential to review, and improve on, the existing mutual legal assistance arrangements in civil and commercial matters continuously. All of them are concerned with either judicial or arbitration proceedings in which counsel are usually heavily involved. On the other hand, there is a huge and growing demand on the Mainland for capacity building on international legal practice. A good recent example is the Legal Services Forum, which included a mock arbitration, held in Xi'an about two weeks ago in late May, which was attended by a large number of Mainland lawyers not just from Shaanxi but many other neighbouring provinces and regions in Western China. One of the most sought-after topics in these capacity building programmes is the skill and etiquette of oral advocacy, which is something that Senior Counsel are renowned for.

 The third challenge is to maintain Hong Kong's international image regarding its rule of law. We have to face the music. For whatever reasons, many people outside Hong Kong do not have a proper and complete understanding of the present state of the rule of law, and the actual operation of our legal and judicial systems, in Hong Kong. Nowadays, perception is reality. A negative perception, no matter how misplaced, is liable to impair people's trust and confidence in Hong Kong as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre. Senior Counsel, owing to their status as respectable and independent legal professionals as well as skillful advocates, are best positioned to tell the good and true story of Hong Kong in this regard.

 These challenges must, of course, be overcome by different branches of the legal profession of Hong Kong together. But, as I said earlier and for reasons that I explained, it is reasonably expected that Senior Counsel, as an institution representing the cream of our profession, should take the lead to do so. I sincerely hope that the three new silks would join the efforts in this respect.

 On this note, may I wish all three of you all the best and every success. Thank you."

Wear loose and light-coloured clothing to reduce heat absorption and facilitate sweat evaporation and heat dissipation;
Avoid vigorous exercise and prolonged activities like hiking or trekking as heat, sweating and exhaustion can place additional demands on the physique;
Perform outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible;
For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;

鄧特抗教授聯同由八所教資會資助大學組成的大學校長會國際化小組的代表團一行，出席美國聖地牙哥的2025年美洲教育者年會暨教育展。鄧特抗教授在年會暨展覽的專題研討會上發表演說，分享香港高等教育的優勢以及為來自世界各地學生提供各項發展機遇。在教資會的資助下，大學校長會國際化小組亦設立香港館，展示香港高等教育界高度國際化及多元的教育環境，歡迎世界各地的學者和學生來港實現他們的抱負。

鄧特抗教授在美洲教育者年會暨教育展中的專題研討會上指出，「多年來，政府在高等教育投放豐富資源，支持八所教資會資助大學持續發展，當中五所教資會資助大學躋身世界百強，六所名列亞洲五十強，四所位列全球最國際化大學首四強。我們約七成的研究成果達到國際卓越水平或以上，而最近一輪的質素核證也再次確認了我們大學為學生提供的高質素教育體驗。香港無疑是學生深造、實現更大成就的理想目的地。」

教資會亦首次支持香港高等教育卓越教學聯盟和大學校長會國際化小組向國際代表分享教資會資助大學如何把握人工智慧帶來的巨大潛力，提升學生的學習體驗。這再次彰顯了香港在優質教育領域，通過投資和創新所展現的領導地位。

UGC Secretary-General visits US and UK,2025-06-07 11:56,2025-06-07 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/07/P2025060600754.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the University Grants Committee:

  The Secretary-General of the University Grants Committee (UGC), Professor James Tang, led a delegation to visit the United States and the United Kingdom from May 25 (San Diego time) to June 6 (Birmingham time) as part of the effort to promote Hong Kong's development into an international hub for post-secondary education.

  Together with the delegation comprising all eight UGC-funded universities under the aegis of the Heads of Universities Committee's Standing Committee on Internationalisation (HUCOMSCI), Professor Tang attended the NAFSA Annual Conference and Expo 2025 held in San Diego, the United States, where he spoke at a dedicated session on the strengths of Hong Kong's higher education sector and the opportunities presented to students from around the world. With funding support from the UGC, the HUCOMSCI also set up a Hong Kong Pavilion to showcase Hong Kong's internationalised and diversified higher education environment that welcomes academics and students from around the world to realise their aspirations.

  ""Over the years, with the substantial investment by the Government in higher education, the eight UGC-funded universities have continued to grow, with five ranked among the world's top 100, six within Asia's top 50, and four as the top most international universities in the world. Some 70 per cent of our research outputs are assessed as internationally excellent, while the most recent round of quality audits also reaffirms the quality of educational experience that our universities offer to students. Hong Kong is indeed the ideal destination for students to pursue their further studies and achieve greater success,"" said Professor Tang at the session at the NAFSA Conference and Expo.

  For the first time, the UGC also supported the Hong Kong Teaching Excellence Alliance and the HUCOMSCI to share with the international audience on how the UGC-funded universities have grasped the immense potential brought by artificial intelligence in enhancing students' learning experiences. This has once again demonstrated Hong Kong's leadership in quality education through investment and innovation.

  Professor Tang then attended the International Higher Education Forum 2025 held on June 4 (Birmingham time) in Birmingham, the United Kingdom, to share the factors underpinning Hong Kong's success as an international hub for post-secondary education. He stressed that academic freedom and institutional autonomy have been the cornerstones of Hong Kong's success, while highlighting the diversified composition of Hong Kong's academic staff. Hong Kong universities attract a strong pool of distinguished scholars with a rich repertoire of international experience, and indeed some 70 per cent of them come from outside Hong Kong.

  In the 2024 Policy Address, the Government announced its support for establishing the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand in order to attract more meritorious students to pursue their studies in Hong Kong. Through participation in international conferences and exhibitions, Hong Kong has continued to expand its network for student mobility and research collaboration. As of November 2024, the eight UGC-funded universities have jointly signed 2660 student exchange agreements with universities from around the world, and engaged in over 6800 active research collaborations with other institutions. At present, around one out of four students in UGC-funded universities are from outside Hong Kong. The Government will continue to support universities to strive for further internationalisation, thereby reinforcing their global reputation and scaling new heights.

  During the visit, Professor Tang also met with senior management and prominent scholars from top-tier higher education institutions in the United States and the United Kingdom to exchange views on the latest developments in higher education. He also highlighted that Hong Kong's outstanding universities have been a welcoming academic home for top scholars and talented students from around the world. As an international hub for higher education, Hong Kong's doors are always open to all who want to realise their academic pursuits and explore the exciting opportunities offered by one of the world's most dynamic cities."

以下是終審法院首席法官張舉能今日（六月七日）在資深大律師委任典禮上的演辭全文（中文譯本）：

律政司司長、大律師公會主席、律師會會長、各位法官同僚、各位來賓：

我懷着榮幸和欣喜的心情，歡迎各位蒞臨這個意義重大的典禮，共同見證林定韻女士、林芷瑩女士及白天賜先生獲委任為資深大律師。

我謹向三位新晉資深大律師致以最熱烈的祝賀。你們在多年執業生涯中刻苦努力，歷經千錘百鍊，竭誠獻身於法律事業，方有今天的成就。這固然可視為你們成就圓滿的一刻，但同樣是新里程的開端——伴隨資深大律師身分而來的責任與寄望。

資深大律師名銜所授予的遠不止於個人榮譽，更關乎社會的認同：精湛的訟辯造詣、卓越的法學水平、以及至高標準的誠信操守。普通法是香港法律制度的根基，而在普通法傳統上資深大律師的角色實乃任重而道遠。資深大律師是一個象徵大律師行列的領導身分，而且體現我們對維持香港司法制度的價值的堅持。

當然，資深大律師的地位具有堅實的法律依據，是由終審法院首席法官根據法例所授予並在委任前廣泛諮詢大律師公會主席、律師會會長，以至司法機構的資深法官。因為有關遴選是以公眾利益為依歸，因而整個過程縝密嚴謹。法律界和廣大社會大眾有權知道，獲得資深大律師頭銜者並非單憑其術業造詣，也是基於他們體現了大律師專業最優良的傳統。

正是這些優良傳統的緣故，才使資深大律師如此任重道遠。首先他們在訟辯能力、專業操守和獨立性方面均需保持至高水平。在對辯式訴訟制度下，法庭指望大律師善用其技巧和秉持誠信，清晰、公道並以法為尚地就案件陳情論辯；而資深大律師在庭上展現的風範，既為聆訊程序的規範和水準定下基調，也為同業後輩作出表率。

法庭以外，資深大律師亦應擔當積極助益的角色，澤蔭大律師行列——扶掖後進、貢獻法律教育，以及維護法律專業的獨立。此外，資深大律師也應當不拘形式地服務公眾，不論是擔任公職、參與法律改革倡議，甚或在合適的時候投身司法服務。

事實上，我們的法律制度已預計躋身資深大律師行列的部分人才日後會被邀請加入司法團隊，出任法官。那些成為大律師界領導者所必備的素質——獨立思維、英明判斷、公平公正、慎思明辨，正是明察斷案的基礎。從這個角度看，委任資深大律師之舉不僅在於對個人往績的肯定，更是對司法機構未來實力以至香港法治的投資。

當我們出類拔萃的新星披上資深大律師的袍服，他們並不只是大律師專業中成就非凡的一員，在個人成就之上，他們更是守護法律專業優良傳統的佼佼者。一個法律制度有多穩健，不僅取決於法律與體制有多完善，亦端賴法律執業者的素養和品格。今天各位獲得委任，令我們對法律專業的未來倍添信心。

在此歡慶時刻，我們當然要感謝支持各位新晉資深大律師的一眾家人、摯友與同儕。在攀上事業高峰的路程上，資深大律師絕非孤軍作戰，而是有賴摯愛親朋沿途作出的莫大貢獻，他們今天同臨慶賀，着實正好不過。

我們當然亦不可忘記事務律師在各位執業生涯中所扮演的重要角色。有了事務律師的信賴和合作，一次次將極其艱巨的案件委託你們三位處理，你們才得以精進訟辯技巧，發展法律思維，展露讓你們成就今天的特質。大律師與給予指示的事務律師之間所建鑄的專業夥伴關係，實為法律專業中的重要一環。今天諸位獲委任為資深大律師，恰好印證了雙方的共同努力。

任何專業要蓬勃發展，生生不息，當中的領導者必須具備清晰的前瞻視野，洞悉他們所服務的社會有何需求和期望，從而為該專業的發展路向規劃籌謀。當有人只顧眼前，為私利而忘大局，領導者必須勇於面對並克服當中的壓力與衝突。就這方面，資深大律師作為其法律專業分支理所當然的領導者，實責無旁貸，使整個專業得以繼續履行其公共職能，同時贏得所服務之社群的尊重。

現在，讓我簡單介紹幾位獲委任人士。

林定韻女士在業內享負盛名，擁有豐富廣博的商業法執業經驗，包括複雜的糾紛、本地及國際仲裁、競爭法和監管法。她亦具有行政法和憲法的執業經驗。林女士以思路清晰、突出的實務技能見稱，其庭上訟辯技巧嫻熟，才略非凡出眾。

林芷瑩女士專攻刑事案件，素以勤勉盡責聞名，在庭上代表任何一方均能無畏地申訴論述、據理力爭，深得各人欽佩。她為人誠信，無論代表控方或是辯方，皆表現專業、客觀持平，為眾人所稱許。她對刑事大律師行列貢獻殊深，獲晉升為資深大律師乃實至名歸。

白天賜先生是業內公認為最成功的公法憲法大律師之一。他具備敏銳的法律思維，處事沉穩幹練，論據嚴謹縝密，深受法官與同儕讚譽。

我想向各位新晉資深大律師再次強調，此身分不只是尊崇的特殊地位，同時也是莊嚴的使命召喚。各位如今身為大律師行列的領導者，便須肩負起獨有的責任：在庭上發揮幹練可靠的訟辯才能之外，更要致力維護法治，堅守司法公義。社會期望你們在法治受到威脅時挺身而出，堅定表態；在法庭內外維持至高的專業操守和誠信；並發揚行業自律儒雅的一貫作風。此外，同樣重要的是，你們必須保持關切之心，守護人人皆可訴諸法庭而不受阻撓的權利。凡此都不是抽象的理想，而是實實在在的原則，是我們法律制度取信於香港市民以至海外大眾的基礎。

法庭、法律專業以至公眾，都仰賴你們的專長學養、楷模榜樣，還有對維護繫於本港法治之各種價值的承擔。我深信你們定會如前輩們一樣，面對挑戰迎難而上，並會延續那份讓你們攀上今天高峰的敬業精神和卓越追求，不負眾望。

我代表司法機構及廣大法律界再一次向各位道賀，並祝願你們在往後的資深大律師生涯中事事順遂，碩果纍纍。

謝謝各位。"
CJ's address at Ceremony for the Admission of the New Senior Counsel (with photos) ,2025-06-07 11:52,2025-06-07 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/07/P2025060700326.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Judiciary:

The following is the full text of an address by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal, at the Ceremony for the Admission of the New Senior Counsel today (June 7):

Secretary for Justice, Chairman of the Bar, President of the Law Society, fellow judges, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a privilege and a pleasure to welcome you all to this important ceremony, marking the admission to the rank of Senior Counsel of Ms Catrina Lam, Ms Priscilia Lam and Mr Timothy Parker.

To each of our appointees, I extend my warmest congratulations. Today is the culmination of years of rigorous practice, professional growth, and steadfast dedication to the law. But while this moment may be viewed as a culmination, it is equally a commencement – a threshold to the responsibilities and expectations that come with the rank of Senior Counsel.

The conferment of silk is not merely an individual honour. It is a public recognition of excellence in advocacy, depth of legal learning, and the highest standards of integrity and conduct. In our common law tradition, which underpins the legal system in Hong Kong, the role of Senior Counsel carries great weight and significance. It is a rank that signifies leadership at the Bar, and a visible commitment to the values that sustain our system of justice.

The rank of Senior Counsel is, of course, grounded in the law. It is conferred by the Chief Justice under statute, following extensive consultation with the Chairman of the Bar, the President of the Law Society, and the senior Judiciary. The process is deliberate and exacting, as it must be, for it serves the public interest above all. The legal community and the wider society are entitled to know that those who bear the distinction of Senior Counsel do so not only on account of their technical ability, but also because they embody the finest traditions of the profession.

It is precisely because of these traditions that the responsibilities of Senior Counsel are so considerable. First and foremost among them is the duty to maintain the highest standards of advocacy, professional integrity, and independence. In an adversarial system, courts rely on the skill and honesty of counsel to present cases with clarity, fairness and a deep respect for the law. Senior Counsel, by their very presence in court, shape the tone and quality of proceedings and must serve as exemplars to the junior Bar.

Beyond the courtroom, Senior Counsel are expected to play an active and constructive role in the life of the Bar – mentoring junior members, contributing to legal education, and upholding the independence of the legal profession. They are also expected to serve the public, whether through public appointments, law reform initiatives, or, in due course, judicial service.

Indeed, our legal framework contemplates that some of those who ascend to the rank of Senior Counsel may in time be called to join the Bench. The qualities that make one a leader at the Bar – independence of mind, sound judgment, fairness, and intellectual rigour – are also those that form the foundation of good judging. In that sense, the appointment to silk is not merely about past achievement; it is an investment in the future strength of the Judiciary and the rule of law in Hong Kong.

As the best of our juniors take silk, they do so not only as individuals of great accomplishment, but as custodians of the finest traditions of the legal profession that are larger than themselves. The strength of any legal system depends not only on the soundness of its laws and institutions, but also on the quality and character of those who practise within it. Today's appointments strengthen our confidence in the future of the profession.

On this happy occasion, we must of course acknowledge the support given to our new silks by their families, friends, and colleagues. Their success is not achieved in isolation. It is fitting that their loved ones are present to celebrate this occasion, for they too have contributed in no small measure to the journeys culminating here this morning.

It would also be remiss not to acknowledge the important role played by instructing solicitors in the professional journeys of today's appointees. The trust and collaboration of those who have briefed our new Senior Counsel – often repeatedly and in the most demanding of cases – have enabled them to refine their advocacy, develop their legal thinking, and demonstrate the very qualities for which they are recognised today. The professional partnerships forged between counsel and those who instruct them are a vital part of the fabric of the legal profession, and today's appointments reflect that shared endeavour.

For any profession to continue to flourish, those entrusted with its guidance must possess a clear and forward-looking vision for its development, shaped by an appreciation of the needs and expectations of the society it exists to serve. They must be prepared to confront and overcome the strains and tensions that may arise from narrow or sectional interests, which are often preoccupied with short-term concerns. Senior Counsel, as the natural leaders of their branch of the legal profession, bear a particular responsibility to support this endeavour, so that the profession as a whole may continue to discharge its public function and command the respect of the community it serves.

Now let me say a few words about our appointees.

Ms Catrina Lam is a highly regarded barrister with a broad commercial practice, encompassing complex disputes, domestic and international arbitration, competition law, and regulatory matters. She also has significant experience in administrative and constitutional law. Ms Lam is known for her clarity of thought, technical excellence, and strong courtroom advocacy.

Ms Priscilia Lam is a highly respected criminal advocate, known for her diligent and fearless advocacy on both sides of the courtroom. She is recognised for her integrity, professionalism, and balanced judgment, whether acting for the prosecution or the defence. Her substantial contribution to the criminal Bar makes her elevation to silk richly deserved.

Mr Timothy Parker has long been regarded as one of the Bar's busiest juniors in the field of public and constitutional law. His sharp legal mind, calm authority, and principled approach have earned him the respect of judges and peers alike.

To each of our new silks, I reiterate: the rank you now hold is not only a privilege, but also a solemn call to service. You are now leaders of the Bar. You bear a particular responsibility not only to serve as highly capable and dependable advocates in court, but also to uphold the rule of law and to safeguard the proper administration of justice. You are expected to speak with courage and conviction where the rule of law is threatened, to maintain the highest standards of professional conduct and integrity, both inside and outside the courtroom, and to uphold the traditions of discipline and courtesy which underpin the profession. No less importantly, you must be vigilant in defending the right of every individual to unimpeded access to the courts. These are not abstract ideals, but living principles that underpin the public's trust in our legal system, both within Hong Kong and beyond.

The courts, the legal profession, and the public will look to you for your expertise, your example, and your commitment to upholding the values that define the rule of law in our society. I have every confidence that you will rise to these challenges, as your predecessors have done, and that you will meet these expectations with the same commitment and excellence that have brought you to this day.

On behalf of the Judiciary and the wider legal community, I offer you my congratulations and wish you every success and fulfilment in your careers as Senior Counsel.

Thank you."
財經事務及庫務局局長談香港金融發展和公司遷冊機制,2025-06-07 11:20,2025-06-07 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/07/P2025060700337.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇今日（六月七日）出席電台節目後會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：最近羅奇對於香港的言論有一個修訂，局長你會怎樣看他今次修訂的原因，是否反映現時香港的機遇比較過往有所不同？你會怎樣回應他的言論？

財經事務及庫務局局長：一直以來，香港整體都有相當的基礎和競爭力，例如數天前我們剛完成了270億港元等值的債券發行，涉及四個幣種。我們的整體發行量是270億港元，但是有興趣的參與（認購金額）其實差不多是2,400億港元等值，所以你看到差不多是八至九倍的超額認購。同一時間，今次是我們第一次有30年期的港元債券，本身都是相當受歡迎的。

因此，即使外間有不同說法，或是對香港有不同的看法，我覺得我們香港要做的就是堅守我們的優勢，做好我們的本分，用好「一國兩制」下給我們很好的一個平台，也包括持續去深化與國際的交往。只要我們繼續做好我們的功夫，我們自然能夠繼續發展。

記者：早前局長到了加拿大游說一些保險公司遷冊來港，你會怎樣看這次的成果呢？接下來是否大家可以看到或預期更多公司可能真的會遷冊來香港？

財經事務及庫務局局長：我們當然很歡迎不同的企業更多地用好我們這套已經建立的公司遷冊機制，我也預期有更多企業有興趣。這正是為何一直以來，在法例生效前和生效後，我們都與相關的包括投資推廣署、香港交易所等保持很密切的溝通，那就是要怎樣能夠用好這個新機制安排去吸引更加多企業，不單是私營企業，也包括上市公司，遷冊來香港。這方面的工作我們會繼續去做，同一時間我們也很期望有其他新的企業會用我們這方面的安排。謝謝。

Remarks by SFST about company re-domiciliation at media session,2025-06-07 11:20,2025-06-07 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/07/P2025060700336.htm,"Following are the remarks made by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at a media session after attending a radio programme this morning (June 7):

Reporter: Mr Hui, can you talk about the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance because you mentioned that this can attract the enterprises and also investment? So how effective is this since the Ordinance came into effect?

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury: Since the enactment of the relevant company re-domiciliation regime legislation on May 23, we have got very positive response from the market, inquiring about how they can do that and at the same time the detailed procedures.

  So far, in terms of inquiries, we have got about 150 of them and in terms of downloads of the relevant information from our website regarding this new regime, the number is close to 10 000. So I think all these are something very positive in terms of how we have been drawing more companies to re-domicile to Hong Kong.

Reporter: What should the Government do to even attract them to use more of other services in Hong Kong?

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury: I think it is natural and also logical. If they decide to re-domicile to Hong Kong, there will be demand for relevant professional services. By that, it could be about accounting, could be about legal, and also other supporting financial and professional services. So once that decision is made, I am sure that the relevant professional sectors in Hong Kong will be able to benefit from that.

Honourable Vice-Chairman Edmund Ho (Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and President of the International Science, Technology and Innovation Forum of Boao Forum for Asia), Deputy Director Liu Guangyuan (Deputy Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)), Deputy Commissioner Li Yongsheng (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the HKSAR), Professor Frederick Ma (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is a great pleasure to join you, today, for the opening of the International Science, Technology and Innovation Forum of the Boao Forum for Asia 2025 Hong Kong Conference. It is an honour for the HKSAR Government to be hosting this Conference together with the Boao Forum for Asia – and for the first time.

I'm pleased to note that over 800 I&T (innovation and technology) professionals and scholars, government officials, economic leaders and high-profile representatives from some 20 countries and regions are taking part in this fourth Boao International Science, Technology and Innovation Forum.

Hong Kong participated in the first three editions of the conference – in Macao, Guangzhou and Zhuhai. Our co-organisation of this year's event continues the Forum's tradition of hosting the conference in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

The Greater Bay Area – bringing together Hong Kong, Macao and nine major cities in Guangdong – is committed to becoming a leading international I&T hub. Ladies and gentlemen, we're well on our way now.

Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Guangzhou have ranked second, as a science and technology cluster, in the World Intellectual Property Organization's Global Innovation Index for the past five consecutive years – a testament both to the individual strengths we bring to our interconnected region, and our collective commitment to excellence.

Consider the I&T progress Hong Kong has made, under the unwavering support of our country. We are now ranked first in Asia, and seventh globally, in digital competitiveness, and third globally, as an emerging start-up centre.

Our development is underpinned by the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, which makes Hong Kong the only world city with both the China advantage and the global advantage.

We take full advantage, too, of the research and development (R&D) expertise of our world-class universities. After all, as a city with just 1 100 square kilometres in area, we boast five universities in the world's top 100. Add to that our established tradition of the rule of law, a common law regime that dovetails with many of the world's financial centres, and a robust intellectual property protection regime, Hong Kong is built to succeed as an international I&T centre.

Ladies and gentlemen, we stand at the consequential crossroads in human history – a moment where artificial intelligence and health technology converge not just as tools, but the architects of our evolution into the next era of development.

Hong Kong is committed to the development of these frontier industries. Our InnoHK research clusters will help us get us there that much faster. InnoHK was created to drive Hong Kong's R&D collaboration with world-renowned universities and research institutions.

Our first two clusters focus on healthcare technology, artificial intelligence and robotics technologies. Our third cluster will specialise in four research areas: sustainable development, energy, advanced manufacturing and materials. And it is open now, through the 29th of August, for applications from international research institutions and universities eager to work with Hong Kong – and the Greater Bay Area.

We're also making more land available for I&T development through the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, which straddles our boundary with Shenzhen. The Hong Kong Park in the Zone will become operational within this year, and bring together vital sources of new quality productive forces for the country.

For innovation to thrive, it must be rooted in international co-operation. The exchange of knowledge, talent and ideas should be open and free. Without borders. Without boundaries. Without tariffs.

A long-standing champion of multilateralism, and a rules-based global economy, Hong Kong is deeply committed to building collaboration among governments, businesses and academic institutions. Everywhere.

And, rest assured, we will continue to advocate for free trade, economic openness and cross-border investment. That will ensure that technology serves as a bridge, rather than a barrier to co-operation, and the economic flourishing and societal well-being it can bring us all.

I wish you all a rewarding Conference, a memorable stay in Hong Kong and the best of innovation and technology in the coming year. Thank you."
Food Safety Day 2025 highlights importance of preventing cross-contamination,2025-06-07 11:00,2025-06-07 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/07/P2025060600317.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department launched its annual Food Safety Day 2025 campaign today (June 7), emphasising the importance of preventing cross-contamination in safeguarding food safety. It serves to remind food businesses and the public that adopting proper hygiene and food handling practices, such as handling raw and cooked food separately, can reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses.

To echo World Food Safety Day, the CFS has chosen ""preventing cross-contamination"" as the theme for Food Safety Day 2025. Cross-contamination is one of the most common causes of food poisoning, occurring when harmful microorganisms are transferred directly or indirectly from raw food to cooked or ready-to-eat food via contaminated hands, utensils, cutting boards, or food contact surfaces.

  ""Food handlers and the public should remain vigilant in storing and handling raw and cooked foods separately, using designated utensils and storage containers, and maintaining good personal and environmental hygiene to prevent the spread of bacteria. If raw and cooked or ready-to-eat food must be handled in the same area, thorough disinfection between uses is essential,"" said a CFS spokesman.

Food handlers and members of the public are also reminded that maintaining hand hygiene is essential for minimising the risk of cross-contamination and ensuring food safety. Hands should be washed thoroughly with liquid soap and clean running water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling food and wearing gloves, as well as after using the toilet, touching the face, or handling waste. Wearing gloves does not replace proper handwashing.

To prevent foodborne diseases and curb the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, the CFS urges food businesses and the public to maintain proper personal and environmental hygiene and observe the ""Five Keys to Food Safety"" when preparing food, including choosing safe raw materials, keeping hands and utensils clean, separating raw and cooked food, cooking thoroughly, and keeping food at safe temperatures.

食物安全日2025強調防止交叉污染的重要性,2025-06-07 11:00,2025-06-07 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/07/P2025060600316.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（六月七日）啓動食物安全日2025的全年活動，強調防止交叉污染對保障食物安全的重要性，並提醒食物業和公眾採取適當衞生和食物處理措施，例如將生熟食物分開處理，以降低食源性疾病的風險。

為響應今年的「世界食品安全日」，中心將「防止交叉污染」定為食物安全日2025的主題。交叉污染是食物中毒最常見的原因之一，致病微生物可透過受污染的手、用具、砧板或食物接觸面，從生食直接或間接轉移至熟食或即食食品，導致交叉污染。

中心發言人說：「食物處理人員和市民應確保生熟食物分開存放和處理，使用專用器具和貯存容器，並保持良好個人及環境衞生，以防止細菌傳播。如需在同一區域處理生食、熟食或即食食品，使用前後應徹底消毒。」

發言人提醒食物處理人員和市民，保持手部衞生對減低交叉污染風險和確保食物安全至關重要。在處理食物和佩戴手套前後，以及如廁、觸摸面部或處理垃圾後，應使用梘液和清潔的流動水徹底洗手不少於20秒，而佩戴手套不能代替徹底洗手。

為預防食源性疾病及抑制抗菌素耐藥性的出現，中心呼籲食物業界和市民保持良好個人及環境衞生，並在準備食物時遵循「食物安全五要點」，包括選擇安全的原材料、保持雙手和用具清潔、分開生熟食物、徹底煮熟食物，以及把食物存放於安全溫度。
