最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

​
上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-07 17:30,2026-02-07 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/07/P2026020700519.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 7), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

大家好！今日我很高興來到香港單車館，與大家一同出席這個意義非凡的嘉許禮，一同向第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）、全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會和第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會）香港賽區的全體義工，表達我們最誠摯的感謝！

今屆全運會及殘特奧會，首次由粵港澳三地共同承辦。香港能夠參與其中，是國家對我們的信任與支持，更是香港體育發展的重要里程碑。

香港賽區各項賽事得以圓滿成功，除了政府各部門和社會各界的通力合作、市民大眾的支持，更有賴一支充滿熱誠的義工團隊。在這裏，我一定要向每一位無私奉獻的義工，致以最衷心的感謝！

在過去一年多來，超過一萬五千名義工積極投身服務，剛才大家在螢幕上也看到，累計服務時數超過36萬小時，動員規模創下香港舉辦大型盛事的紀錄，從來未試過有這麼多人參與。

剛才播放的短片，讓我們重溫了義工團隊服務的動人時刻。無論是賽事接待、競賽支援、觀眾服務，還是禮賓安排、頒獎協助，處處都有你們的身影。

​​你們的熱誠，為賽事注入了溫度；你們的付出，成為運動員最堅實的後盾；你們的專注與笑容，更讓來自全國各地的參賽者和觀眾，親身感受到香港的熱情與效率。

​​今天的嘉許禮，是對全體義工無私奉獻的肯定。你們所展現的義工精神，是香港社會寶貴的財富。我希望大家將這份服務熱誠延續下去，帶動更多人參與義務工作，共建更美好的和諧社會。

今次義工計劃得以順利推行，有賴社會各界的鼎力支持。我要特別感謝香港賽馬會作為香港賽區唯一合作夥伴，不單止全力資助義工服務，更派出馬會義工隊親身參與。

同時，我衷心感謝義務工作發展局和香港志願者協會，攜手協助全運會統籌辦公室招募、培訓及管理這支香港歷來規模最大的義工團隊。

此外，我亦要感謝所有培訓支援單位，你們提供的專業訓練，確保義工團隊高度專業、一絲不苟。

Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2026-02-07 15:55,2026-02-07 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/07/P2026020700464.htm,"An incoming passenger was sentenced to two months' imprisonment and fined $2,000 at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts today (February 7) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted the incoming male passenger, aged 55, at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (February 6) and seized about 10 980 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $49,400 and a duty potential of about $36,300, from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

海關人員昨日（二月六日）在香港國際機場截查一名五十五歲抵港男旅客，並在他攜帶的個人行李內共檢獲約一萬零九百八十支未完稅香煙，市值共約四萬九千四百元，應課稅值總共約三萬六千三百元。該名抵港旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《應課稅品條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"

記者︰局長，想問民青局今個月會幫忙發放「樓宇更新大行動」的資金，現時大概實行了一星期，請問發放的情況如何？

民政及青年事務局局長︰宏福苑的業主之前在大維修時申請了市區重建局（市建局）的「樓宇更新大行動2.0」資助計劃。按市建局以往的一般做法，該部分的資助會存入管委會（法團管理委員會）的戶口，即法團的戶口，然後由法團處理，因為這部分是給予法團的。但大家都知道民青局在去年十二月向土地審裁處申請引用《建築物管理條例》第31條，申請解散管委會和委任華懋集團旗下的合安管理有限公司（合安）為委任管理人，而在一月六日土地審裁處亦批出了這個申請，所以在過去這個月合安管理有限公司正在處理法律上的手續和程序，包括和市建局洽商了這部分本來會存入法團戶口的資助，直接透過市建局發出的支票發放給業主。合安管理有限公司作為管理人亦願意協助市建局派發支票，但當中牽涉我們如何與業主聯絡，因為有關的業主可能現居於不同的地方，我們亦很感謝社署（社會福利署）的同事，「一戶一社工」協助聯絡這些業主。現時已經聯絡了300多個業主，我估計截至今日可能數目已經達400多個，合安管理有限公司會在一些比較多居民居住的地方，例如過渡性房屋或房協的房屋，安排設置一些服務站，方便居於那裏的業主可以拿到支票，合安會幫忙派發這些支票。我們看到很多不同的部門包括發展局、市建局、社署的同事，加上民政署的同事、合安管理有限公司大家一起合作，希望可以儘快將資助直接給予業主。

記者：想問問日前有區議員被人看到她在消防通道泊車，民青局或民政署方面會不會有提醒或處分？

民政及青年事務局局長︰我理解有關的區議員已經向社會大眾致歉。而葵青民政事務專員作為區議會主席不單有口頭提醒，亦已發信嚴正提醒有關的區議員，大家的行為舉止一定要符合公眾對區議員的期望。事實上，這也是為何我們會在今屆區議會成立之初設立履職監察機制等等，我們希望區議員盡責履職之餘，更要清楚社會大眾對區議員的期望。我們也要求每位區議員盡責履職，謹言慎行，他們的一舉一動、行為舉止都必須符合公眾對區議會、區議員的期望。謝謝！"

祝小東部長 （中聯辦九龍工作部部長）、陸海天教授（香港優才及專才協會主席）、駱勇主席（香港優才及專才協會創會主席）、林振昇議員（立法會人力事務委員會副主席）、洪錦鉉議員 （立法會議員）、趙汝恆教授（香港理工大學高級副校長（研究及創新））、尊敬的葛明博士（工業專員）：

非常高興今日早上來到香港理工大學的圖書館， 讓大家一起出席見證《贏在AI+》第二季香港專場路演啟動禮。在這裡非常感謝中央廣播電視總台和香港優才及專才協會選擇在這裏舉辦路演活動，也邀請我作為今日上午的一位嘉賓，也見證了在AI（人工智能）這一領域在人才和產業的重要性。

在香港，勞福局的其中一個主要任務是為香港去 「搶人才」、「留人才」，產業這方面就要交給創科局（創新及科技局），葛明博士今日也在場。剛才陸海天教授說得非常好，他說AI是一個改變世界，決定在未來世界的競爭中誰領先、誰落後的關鍵驅動力。誰在AI領域中領跑的話，就肯定是要領跑全世界的。所以選擇在香港舉行這次啟動禮，我覺得這代表着國家對香港的重視，香港是金融中心、貿易中心、航運中心，將來一定可以成為創科中心。

作為創科中心，核心的驅動力是離不開AI的，而且以香港來說，除了AI以外，像節目中提到的AI+，這個加號可能對香港是更重要的，我對這個加號的理解就是AI的應用，即可以應用不同的場景，要更好地發揮AI的無限潛力。在這一領域，香港在過去一百多年以時間、經驗證明，香港是最能將科技轉化成產業、轉化成財富的地方，所以我很期待，所以記得現在AI+的所有參與者，要好好的用好一國兩制的制度優勢，用好香港和國際規則對接的優勢，用好香港金融中心、人才中心這個巨大的優勢。

過去數年，隨着政府提出一系列的「搶人才」政策，加上香港自身的優勢，不管從國際人才排名、創科排名都可以看到香港取得巨大進步。但是我們不會停步，這個只是開始。隨着政府的政策、資金的投入；隨着「十五五」規劃，國家對AI的重點重視，我相信我們只要用好香港的制度優勢，用好國家給香港的巨大支持，引來世界各地的優秀AI人才來港發展，一定可以做到今日央視節目所說的──《贏在AI+》，贏在香港。

歡迎大家來到香港，也祝願所有參賽者取得巨大成功，用好香港，在香港閃耀自己。

感謝大家。"
