Delivering a speech at the dinner reception, the Director of the SHETO, Mrs Laura Aron, highlighted that the HKSAR Government has focused on economic development, achieving remarkable results. She encouraged citizens and enterprises in Shanghai and the East China region to continue leveraging Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"" to explore business opportunities, invest, and pursue employment or entrepreneurship in Hong Kong. She also expressed hope for continued robust co-operation between Shanghai and Hong Kong in areas such as trade, innovation, culture, and youth development, fostering mutual benefits.

Mrs Aron mentioned that next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the SHETO. She expressed gratitude to the Communist Party of China Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government for their support for the work of the HKSAR Government and the SHETO. The SHETO will continue to facilitate Shanghai-Hong Kong co-operation and support mutual success to make greater contributions to the country's high-quality development.

The Deputy Commissioner of Police (Management), Mr Chan Joon-sun, who is visiting Shanghai, attended the dinner. Speaking at the dinner reception, he shared that each anniversary occasion is an opportunity to review the development and achievements of ""one country, two systems"". With the introduction of the dual legislation on national security, Hong Kong has embarked on a new journey, advancing from chaos to order, and from stability to prosperity. It demonstrates the institutional advantages and strong vitality of ""one Country, two systems"". The country has been providing Hong Kong with opportunities to leverage its unique advantage of having strong support from the motherland and close connection with the world, promoting two-way exchanges between the mainland and the international community.

Hong Kong member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Shanghai and Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of New Frontier Group, Mr Carl Wu, also shared remarks at the dinner on Shanghai's support for Hong Kong-invested enterprises and the exchanges between Shanghai and Hong Kong.

The SHETO also invited emerging Hong Kong young artists to perform at the dinner reception, showcasing Hong Kong's diverse cultural charm through a suona performance blending Chinese and Western elements. Several Hong Kong students in Shanghai were also invited to showcase their talents.

The theme of the dinner reception was ""Multifaceted Hong Kong, Infinite Possibilities"", featuring interactive exhibition areas and photo check-in points themed around nine tourism development projects recently announced by the Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, alongside the giant pandas gifted by the Central Government as design ideas, offering guests an immersive, multifaceted, and engaging experience of Hong Kong.

The SHETO, in collaboration with Invest Hong Kong, also organised a seminar entitled ""Hong Kong: Enabler of Mainland Catering and Food Enterprises to Go Global"" today. Insights on the competitive advantages and development opportunities of Hong Kong as a preferred place for business were shared with over 100 representatives from catering, food and other industrial sectors in the East China region. They were encouraged to set up business in and develop overseas markets through Hong Kong."

They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Distinguished guests, fellow citizens,

Today marks the 28th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China and the third anniversary of the current term of the Government. Over these three years, the Government has forged ahead with reforms to build a safe and stable Hong Kong, and striven to develop the economy and improve people's livelihood. Our efforts are gradually delivering results.

I have changed the culture of the Government and formed a ""result-oriented"" Government. We have fulfilled the constitutional duty by enacting the local legislation for Article 23 of the Basic Law, a historic task long envisioned by previous terms of the Government but unrealised until now. We have rebuilt a safe Hong Kong. This year, Hong Kong is ranked seventh globally in the safety index.

The Government has spared no efforts in addressing land and housing issues. The waiting time for public housing has been shortened by about nine and a half months, from 6.1 years to 5.3 years. In our combat against the abuse of public rental housing resources, another 8700 or so housing units have been recovered, equivalent to about 11 public housing blocks and a saving of around $8.7billion in construction costs. We have acted swiftly to build Light Public Housing for intake by over 9 500 households within this year, relieving the imminent housing needs of more than 9 500 families.

Since we assumed office, Hong Kong's economy has shifted from negative to positive growth. Median monthly household income during the period has risen by $3,000, an increase of over 11 per cent. We attach great importance on labour rights. The abolition of the Mandatory Provident Fund offsetting arrangement has taken effect, and the review cycle of the Statutory Minimum Wage has now been revised from every two years to every year.

We have strengthened mutual market access, relaxed the listing requirements for biotechnology and specialist technology companies, established a licensing regime for stablecoin and simplified listing procedures, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of the financial sector. Hong Kong has climbed up one place in its ranking as a financial centre and secured the third place globally.

We have endeavoured to trawl for talent, compete for enterprises, and attract companies and investment to Hong Kong. Over 210 000 professionals, top talent and quality migrants have arrived in Hong Kong, boosting the city's competitiveness. We have attracted 84 strategic enterprises from frontier technological industries to Hong Kong, bringing in investment amounting to some $50 billion and creating over 20 000 job opportunities. We have simplified the regime for company re-domiciliation, with two major global insurance companies readily expressing their interest in re-domiciling to Hong Kong. Hong Kong's global position in the World Competitiveness Yearbook has improved for two consecutive years, rising from the seventh to the third place. For World Talent Ranking, Hong Kong has returned to the top ten, climbing up seven places to the ninth position.

Amid economic restructuring, Hong Kong is faced with challenges as well as opportunities. With the advantages of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, the challenges we face would be outweighed by the opportunities available to us. Looking ahead, our major tasks will cover three areas:

First, to safeguard high-quality development with high-level security. We will actively co-ordinate the coherence between security and development. Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong will remain steadfast in maintaining national security, fully seize national opportunities and proactively integrate into the overall national development, with a view to fostering economic growth and development while assisting enterprises in upgrading their operations and expanding domestic and overseas sales markets. We will deepen international exchanges and co-operation, explore new markets and opportunities, bolster the provision of extensive supply chain services, expand and strengthen regional trade with the aim of offsetting the risk of over-reliance on a single market in business trade. In addition to dedicating our efforts to the development of innovation and technology and expanding digital trade and supporting the development of local enterprises, we will introduce new technologies and industries, and continue to compete for talent and enterprises, further securing our position as an international financial, shipping and trade centre.

Second, to speed up the development of the Northern Metropolis. The Northern Metropolis, which takes up around one-third of Hong Kong's area and will later accommodate one-third of our population, is a new engine for the development of Hong Kong. By introducing new concepts and new methods, removing potential barriers and leveraging market forces, we aim to enhance the speed and efficiency of developing the Northern Metropolis, the San Tin Technopole, and the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone. With a focus on industry development and innovative technology, our goal is to attract scientific research talent from around the world and concentrate innovation resources, in order to promote the establishment of Hong Kong as a hub for high-calibre talent and drive the overall development of Hong Kong.

Third, to improve people's livelihood proactively. Our policy objective is to make Hong Kong a better place for living and working – for people to enjoy better living and accommodation, for young people to fully realise their potential, and for the elderly to be well taken care of.

The HKSAR Government will sustain its efforts in improving people's livelihood in such aspects as housing, medical health, education and welfare, thus enhancing people's quality of life. We will remain committed to accelerating the supply of public housing to further reduce the waiting time, and ensure the timely provision of Light Public Housing to meet pressing demand. The registration of compliant Basic Housing Units, which will replace substandard subdivided units, is expected to begin in March next year. The Government will continue to deepen the reform of the healthcare system and improve public and primary healthcare services. We will remain committed to the strategy of targeted poverty alleviation, focusing on directing resources to those most in need. On transportation, the Government will take forward the implementation of the Hong Kong Major Transport Infrastructure Development Blueprint, pressing ahead with various railway projects, including the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link connecting Hung Shui Kiu and Qianhai, the Northern Link Spur Line, as well as local smart and green mass transit systems.

As a Chinese saying goes, ""Is there anything too hard in the world? With determined efforts, a hard task becomes easy; otherwise, an easy job may become difficult"". We would rather be reformers who rise to challenges than become complacent idlers. Amid an everâchanging geopolitical landscape and constantly increasing uncertainties, Hong Kong is able to showcase exactly to the world the certainties of safety, stability and development opportunities. These are precisely what the world needs and seeks. Hong Kong is a place where national and global opportunities converge. As long as we are determined to fully seize the opportunities, keep enhancing our value and competiveness, undertake reforms for progress and foster innovation, I am confident the wisdom and experience of the people of Hong Kong will help our Pearl of the Orient shine brighter than ever on the world stage! Thank you."

各位嘉賓、各位市民：

今日是中華人民共和國香港特別行政區成立二十八周年的大日子，也是本屆政府上任的三周年。三年來，政府推動改革，我們建立了安全和穩定的香港，我們發展經濟、改善民生，陸續見到成果。

我改變了政府文化，建立以結果為目標的政府。我們完成了《基本法》第二十三條本地立法的憲制責任，完成歷屆政府想做而未能達成的歷史任務，我們重建一個安全的香港；今年在最安全城市排名裏面，香港排名全球第七。

我們全力處理土地房屋問題：公屋輪候時間由6.1年下降至5.3年，縮短約九個半月；打擊濫用公屋，多收回約8 700個單位，等於近11座公屋，等同省回約87億元建築費；我們快速興建「簡約公屋」，今年會有約9 500戶入伙，讓9 500個家庭即時解困。

本屆政府上任以來，香港經濟由負增長轉為正增長，家庭收入以中位數計增加三千元，上升超過百分之十一。我們重視勞工權益，落實取消強積金「對沖」，最低工資由「兩年一檢」改為「一年一檢」。

我們強化互聯互通，協助生物科技和特專科技公司上市，制定穩定幣發牌制度，優化了上市程序，提升金融競爭力。香港的金融中心地位上升一位，穩居世界第三。

我們着力搶人才、搶企業、招商引資，已經抵港的專才、高才、優才超過21萬人，有助提升香港競爭力。我們引進了84間從事前沿科技的重點企業，帶來約500億港元投資，創造超過2萬個職位。我們簡化公司遷冊機制，兩間國際保險大行即時表示會遷冊香港。香港的世界競爭力排名連續兩年上升，由世界第七升至世界第三，人才競爭力排名重回十大，上升七位至世界第九。

香港正值經濟轉型期，面對着挑戰和機遇。在「一國兩制」之下的優勢，香港機遇大於挑戰。展望未來，我們的重點工作會在三方面：

第一，以高水平安全護航高質量發展。我們會統籌好安全和發展。在「一國兩制」下，我們會堅定維護國家安全，並把握國家機遇，積極融入國家發展大局，全力拼經濟、謀發展，幫助企業升級轉型，拓展內外銷市場；我們會深化國際交往合作，開拓新市場、新機遇，強化全供應鏈服務，做大、做深區域貿易，抵銷過分依賴單一市場的貿易風險。我們會大力發展科技創新，擴大數字貿易，推動本地企業發展，同時引進技術和產業，繼續搶人才、搶企業，鞏固國際金融、航運、貿易中心地位。

第二，加快發展北部都會區。北部都會區佔香港面積約三分之一，人口亦將佔三分之一，是香港發展的新引擎。我們會引入新理念、新辦法，拆牆鬆綁，結合市場力量，提速提效，加快發展北部都會區、新田科技城、河套深港科技創新合作區的香港園區，以產業發展為重點考慮，以創新科技為核心，吸引全球科研人才和創新資源集聚，促進高端人才集聚高地建設，帶動香港整體發展。

第三，着力改善民生。我施政的目標，是讓市民有更好的生活、更好的居所，青年有更好的發展，長者有更好的照顧，市民安居樂業。

特區政府會持續在住屋、醫療、教育和福利等方面改善民生，提升市民生活質素。我們會繼續加快公營房屋供應，進一步縮短公屋輪候時間；確保「簡約公屋」如期供應，以解燃眉之急；取締「劏房」的合規「簡樸房」有望明年三月開始進行登記。政府會繼續深化醫療體系改革，加強公營和基層醫療服務。我們會繼續實踐精準扶貧理念，聚焦幫助排在隊尾最需要幫助的人。在交通方面，政府會推進落實運輸基建發展藍圖，全力推動各鐵路項目，包括洪水橋至前海的港深西部鐵路、北環線支線和區內智慧綠色集體運輸系統等。

常言道：「天下事有難易乎？為之，則難者亦易矣；不為，則易者亦難矣」。我們寧願做艱難的改革者，都不能做安逸的停滯者。現今地緣政治風雲變幻，不確定性不斷增加，香港可提供給世界的正正是安全和發展的確定性。這些確定性是現今世界需要和渴求的。國家機遇和世界機遇都圍繞着香港，只要我們把握好機遇，不斷提升自身價值和競爭力，改革求進，創新創造，憑着香港人的智慧和經驗，我有信心，東方之珠一定能夠在世界舞台上綻放更耀眼的光芒！多謝大家。"

各位嘉賓、各位市民：

今日是中華人民共和國香港特別行政區成立二十八周年的大日子，也是本屆政府上任的三周年。三年來，政府推動改革，我們建立了安全和穩定的香港，我們發展經濟、改善民生，陸續見到成果。

我改變了政府文化，建立以結果為目標的政府。我們完成了《基本法》第二十三條本地立法的憲制責任，完成歷屆政府想做而未能達成的歷史任務，我們重建一個安全的香港；今年在最安全城市排名裏面，香港排名全球第七。

我們全力處理土地房屋問題：公屋輪候時間由6.1年下降至5.3年，縮短約九個半月；打擊濫用公屋，多收回約8 700個單位，等於近11座公屋，等同省回約87億元建築費；我們快速興建「簡約公屋」，今年會有約9 500戶入伙，讓9 500個家庭即時解困。

本屆政府上任以來，香港經濟由負增長轉為正增長，家庭收入以中位數計增加三千元，上升超過百分之十一。我們重視勞工權益，落實取消強積金「對沖」，最低工資由「兩年一檢」改為「一年一檢」。

我們強化互聯互通，協助生物科技和特專科技公司上市，制定穩定幣發牌制度，優化了上市程序，提升金融競爭力。香港的金融中心地位上升一位，穩居世界第三。

我們着力搶人才、搶企業、招商引資，已經抵港的專才、高才、優才超過21萬人，有助提升香港競爭力。我們引進了84間從事前沿科技的重點企業，帶來約500億港元投資，創造超過2萬個職位。我們簡化公司遷冊機制，兩間國際保險大行即時表示會遷冊香港。香港的世界競爭力排名連續兩年上升，由世界第七升至世界第三，人才競爭力排名重回十大，上升七位至世界第九。

香港正值經濟轉型期，面對着挑戰和機遇。在「一國兩制」之下的優勢，香港機遇大於挑戰。展望未來，我們的重點工作會在三方面：

Distinguished guests, fellow citizens,

Today marks the 28th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China and the third anniversary of the current term of the Government. Over these three years, the Government has forged ahead with reforms to build a safe and stable Hong Kong, and striven to develop the economy and improve people's livelihood. Our efforts are gradually delivering results.

I have changed the culture of the Government and formed a ""result-oriented"" Government. We have fulfilled the constitutional duty by enacting the local legislation for Article 23 of the Basic Law, a historic task long envisioned by previous terms of the Government but unrealised until now. We have rebuilt a safe Hong Kong. This year, Hong Kong is ranked seventh globally in the safety index.

The Government has spared no efforts in addressing land and housing issues. The waiting time for public housing has been shortened by about nine and a half months, from 6.1 years to 5.3 years. In our combat against the abuse of public rental housing resources, another 8700 or so housing units have been recovered, equivalent to about 11 public housing blocks and a saving of around $8.7billion in construction costs. We have acted swiftly to build Light Public Housing for intake by over 9 500 households within this year, relieving the imminent housing needs of more than 9 500 families.

Since we assumed office, Hong Kong's economy has shifted from negative to positive growth. Median monthly household income during the period has risen by $3,000, an increase of over 11 per cent. We attach great importance on labour rights. The abolition of the Mandatory Provident Fund offsetting arrangement has taken effect, and the review cycle of the Statutory Minimum Wage has now been revised from every two years to every year.

We have strengthened mutual market access, relaxed the listing requirements for biotechnology and specialist technology companies, established a licensing regime for stablecoin and simplified listing procedures, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of the financial sector. Hong Kong has climbed up one place in its ranking as a financial centre and secured the third place globally.

We have endeavoured to trawl for talent, compete for enterprises, and attract companies and investment to Hong Kong. Over 210 000 professionals, top talent and quality migrants have arrived in Hong Kong, boosting the city's competitiveness. We have attracted 84 strategic enterprises from frontier technological industries to Hong Kong, bringing in investment amounting to some $50 billion and creating over 20 000 job opportunities. We have simplified the regime for company re-domiciliation, with two major global insurance companies readily expressing their interest in re-domiciling to Hong Kong. Hong Kong's global position in the World Competitiveness Yearbook has improved for two consecutive years, rising from the seventh to the third place. For World Talent Ranking, Hong Kong has returned to the top ten, climbing up seven places to the ninth position.

Amid economic restructuring, Hong Kong is faced with challenges as well as opportunities. With the advantages of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, the challenges we face would be outweighed by the opportunities available to us. Looking ahead, our major tasks will cover three areas:

First, to safeguard high-quality development with high-level security. We will actively co-ordinate the coherence between security and development. Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong will remain steadfast in maintaining national security, fully seize national opportunities and proactively integrate into the overall national development, with a view to fostering economic growth and development while assisting enterprises in upgrading their operations and expanding domestic and overseas sales markets. We will deepen international exchanges and co-operation, explore new markets and opportunities, bolster the provision of extensive supply chain services, expand and strengthen regional trade with the aim of offsetting the risk of over-reliance on a single market in business trade. In addition to dedicating our efforts to the development of innovation and technology and expanding digital trade and supporting the development of local enterprises, we will introduce new technologies and industries, and continue to compete for talent and enterprises, further securing our position as an international financial, shipping and trade centre.

Second, to speed up the development of the Northern Metropolis. The Northern Metropolis, which takes up around one-third of Hong Kong's area and will later accommodate one-third of our population, is a new engine for the development of Hong Kong. By introducing new concepts and new methods, removing potential barriers and leveraging market forces, we aim to enhance the speed and efficiency of developing the Northern Metropolis, the San Tin Technopole, and the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone. With a focus on industry development and innovative technology, our goal is to attract scientific research talent from around the world and concentrate innovation resources, in order to promote the establishment of Hong Kong as a hub for high-calibre talent and drive the overall development of Hong Kong.

Third, to improve people's livelihood proactively. Our policy objective is to make Hong Kong a better place for living and working – for people to enjoy better living and accommodation, for young people to fully realise their potential, and for the elderly to be well taken care of.

The HKSAR Government will sustain its efforts in improving people's livelihood in such aspects as housing, medical health, education and welfare, thus enhancing people's quality of life. We will remain committed to accelerating the supply of public housing to further reduce the waiting time, and ensure the timely provision of Light Public Housing to meet pressing demand. The registration of compliant Basic Housing Units, which will replace substandard subdivided units, is expected to begin in March next year. The Government will continue to deepen the reform of the healthcare system and improve public and primary healthcare services. We will remain committed to the strategy of targeted poverty alleviation, focusing on directing resources to those most in need. On transportation, the Government will take forward the implementation of the Hong Kong Major Transport Infrastructure Development Blueprint, pressing ahead with various railway projects, including the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link connecting Hung Shui Kiu and Qianhai, the Northern Link Spur Line, as well as local smart and green mass transit systems.

As a Chinese saying goes, ""Is there anything too hard in the world? With determined efforts, a hard task becomes easy; otherwise, an easy job may become difficult"". We would rather be reformers who rise to challenges than become complacent idlers. Amid an everâchanging geopolitical landscape and constantly increasing uncertainties, Hong Kong is able to showcase exactly to the world the certainties of safety, stability and development opportunities. These are precisely what the world needs and seeks. Hong Kong is a place where national and global opportunities converge. As long as we are determined to fully seize the opportunities, keep enhancing our value and competiveness, undertake reforms for progress and foster innovation, I am confident the wisdom and experience of the people of Hong Kong will help our Pearl of the Orient shine brighter than ever on the world stage! Thank you."
