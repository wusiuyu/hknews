Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for July 2025,2025-08-11 16:30,2025-08-11 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100461.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (August 11) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for July 2025.

  The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs increased from 41.6 in June 2025 in the contractionary zone to 42.1 in July 2025, whereas the one-month's ahead (i.e. August 2025) outlook DI on business receipts was 45.5. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts, despite below the 50-mark, rose in July 2025 as compared with previous month for many surveyed sectors, particularly for the real estate (from 44.2 to 46.2) and business services (from 43.5 to 44.8).

  The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades remained at 45.0 in July 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month's time (i.e. August 2025) was 47.0.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business sentiment among SMEs and their outlook in one month's time both improved slightly in July. Meanwhile, the overall employment situation remained largely stable.

  Looking ahead, the elevated uncertainties in the external environment would continue to affect the local business sentiment. Nonetheless, the resilient local economy and steady economic growth in Asia, particularly in the Mainland, should provide support. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.

Further information

  The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to establishments with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent establishments in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

  The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own establishments rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300).

二零二五年七月份中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查結果,2025-08-11 16:30,2025-08-11 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100459.htm,"政府統計處今日（八月十一日）發表二零二五年七月份中小型企業（中小企）業務狀況按月統計調查的結果。

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年六月在收縮區域的41.6上升至二零二五年七月的42.1，而未來一個月（即二零二五年八月）的業務收益展望動向指數為45.5。按行業分析，業務收益現時動向指數雖低於50的分界線，但不少統計調查涵蓋的行業的相關指數在二零二五年七月較上月上升，特別是地產業（從44.2上升至46.2）及商用服務業（從43.5上升至44.8）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數在二零二五年七月維持在45.0，而未來一個月（即二零二五年八月）的新訂單展望動向指數為47.0。

評論

政府發言人表示，七月中小企的營商氣氛和對未來一個月的預期均略為改善。同時，整體就業情況維持大致穩定。

展望未來，外圍環境不確定性高企，將繼續影響本地營商氣氛。然而，本地經濟表現強韌，加上亞洲尤其是內地經濟持續穩步增長，應可提供支持。政府會繼續密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指就業人數少於50人的機構單位。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於大規模機構單位的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己機構單位情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-08-11 16:30,2025-08-11 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100447.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (August 11) reported the latest number of cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD), and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From August 3 to 9, the CHP recorded seven community-acquired LD cases. The details of the cases are as follows:


A 59-year-old female patient with good past healthliving in Tuen Mun District;
A 70-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Yuen Long District;
A 69-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in North District;
A 70-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Eastern District;
A 63-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Kwun Tong District;
A 99-year-old female patient with underlying illnesses living in Central and Western District; and
A 70-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Southern District.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigation revealed that all seven cases are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of August 9, 103 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-08-11 16:30,2025-08-11 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100444.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（八月十一日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在八月三日至九日期間，衞生防護中心錄得七宗社區感染的退伍軍人病個案，詳情如下：


59歲女病人，過往健康良好，居於屯門區；
70歲男病人，有長期病患，居於元朗區；
69歲男病人，有長期病患，居於北區；
70歲男病人，有長期病患，居於東區；
63歲男病人，有長期病患，居於觀塘區；
99歲女病人，有長期病患，居於中西區；及
70歲男病人，有長期病患，居於南區。


衞生防護中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示七宗個案全部屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這些個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至八月九日，今年錄得103宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


​市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及

100 candidates for 2025 Election Committee Subsector By-elections and 10 nominees determined as validly nominated,2025-08-11 14:20,2025-08-11 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100344.htm,"The Candidate Eligibility Review Committee (CERC) today (August 11) announced that the nomination of 100 candidates for the Election Committee (EC) Subsector By-elections and 10 nominations for EC members have been determined as valid. In addition, the CERC also determined eight registrations of ex-officio EC members as valid.

Candidates nominated for EC subsectors election

As regards the 93 vacancies in the EC membership to be returned by the 2025 EC Subsector By-elections, by the close of nominations on August 4, the Returning Officers (ROs) received a total of 101 nomination forms for candidates. Upon review, the CERC has determined 100 candidates as validly nominated. One candidate had passed away during the nomination period. The CERC thus determined his nomination as invalid in accordance with relevant electoral law.

Members returned by nominations for EC subsectors

As for the 10 members to be returned through supplementary nominations by designated bodies, the ROs received a total of eight nomination forms submitted by designated bodies, involving 11 nominees. According to section 12(2) of the Electoral Affairs Commission (Electoral Procedure)(Election Committee) Regulation (Cap. 541I), the CERC is only required to determine the validity of nominations for the number that are necessary for filling the assigned seats of the subsector-concerned. In this connection, the CERC has determined 10 nominations, according to the priorities indicated by the designated bodies, are sufficient for filling the number of seats assigned to the subsectors. The CERC had not determined the eligibility of an additional nominee.

Registrations of ex-officio EC members

In accordance with section 5J of the Schedule to the Chief Executive Election Ordinance (Cap. 569), a person holding a specified office under Part 2A of the Schedule may register as an ex-officio EC member. If the specified person concerned is not eligible to be registered as an ex-officio member or is the holder of more than one specified office, he/she may designate another person who is holding an office in a relevant body in relation to the specified office to be registered as anex-officio member.

The Registration and Electoral Office (REO) has received eight registrations for ex-officio members. Upon review, the CERC has determined that these eight registrations are valid. The subsectors and specified offices involved are listed below:
