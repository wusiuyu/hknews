Hong Kong Customs detects two drug trafficking cases invloving passengers at airport (with photo),2025-08-04 22:17,2025-08-04 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400893.htm,"Hong Kong Customs today (August 4) detected two drug trafficking cases involving passengers at Hong Kong International Airport and seized a total of about 20 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with a total estimated market value of about $4 million. Two men were arrested.

The two cases involved two male passengers, aged 49 and 37, who both arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found about 10kg of suspected cannabis buds in each of their check-in suitcases. The two batches of suspected cannabis buds were concealed by vacuum-sealed bags. The two men were subsequently arrested.

The arrested person in the first case has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug and he will appear at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (August 5). The investigation of the second case is ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

âMembers of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
FEHD continues to step up mosquito control and elimination efforts in view of imported chikungunya fever case (with photos),2025-08-04 21:56,2025-08-04 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400906.htm,"  A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (August 4) that, in response to the recent imported case of chikungunya fever (CF), the FEHD works with relevant departments and stakeholders to continuously strengthen mosquito control and elimination work, including removing stagnant water inside construction sites and locations with higher mosquito infestation risks, eliminating adult mosquitoes, conducting publication and education. To effectively implement the mosquito prevention and control work, the FEHD appeals again to the trade to strengthen efforts on mosquito control and elimination.

  Since last month, the FEHD has stepped up mosquito prevention and control measures across all districts to reduce the risk of transmission of CF and other mosquito-borne diseases. Following the recent imported CF case, the FEHD has immediately conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations within 250-metre radius of residence of the patient, including eliminating breeding places and potential breeding grounds, and carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas to eliminate adult mosquitoes. In addition, relevant departments will continue to conduct mosquito prevention and control work in areas under their purview to achieve greater prevention and control effect. In collaboration with relevant departments and local community, the FEHD is also stepping up publicity and educational efforts in the affected district to raise public awareness of mosquito prevention.

  As recent heavy rainstorms have led to stagnant water accumulation at construction sites near the patient's residence, the FEHD has promptly inspected 21 construction sites in the vicinity today and issued 22 statutory notices to the contractors of construction sites with stagnant water, in accordance with Section 27 of the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132), requiring the person-in-charge of relevant construction contractors to effectively eliminate mosquito breeding places. The contractors have taken follow-up actions, and in view of the recent heavy rainfall, removed stagnant water and taken relevant measures, such as placing temephos sand granules to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. The FEHD will continue to monitor the relevant situation.

  The FEHD has been identifying and promptly handling mosquito breeding places through inspections and public complaints. In case of accumulation of water in construction sites or other premises, the FEHD may issue statutory notices to require person-in-charge of the premises to follow up. If there is evidence that the person-in-charge of premises not taking the responsibility resulting in mosquito breeding, the FEHD can take enforcement actions. As of the end of July, the FEHD has initiated 84 prosecutions this year, including 77 cases related to construction sites and 7 cases involving other premises.

  When meeting with trade representatives in the end of July this year, the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) and the FEHD appealed to workers at outdoor construction sites to raise awareness and take personal protective measures to avoid mosquito bites. The EEB and the FEHD expect the relevant trade to continue adopting measures to reduce the risk of disease transmission.

  Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD again appeals to members of the public to continue joining hands in strengthening personal mosquito control measures:

Tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
Remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
Change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants no more than every 7 days;
Properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquito from accessing the water;
Properly dispose articles that are able to contain water such as empty lunch boxes, cans and tyres; and
Pave or fill uneven ground and/or holes.


  Members of the public may refer to the FEHD's webpage on mosquito prevention and control (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/risk-pest-mosquito.html#), and should constantly pay attention to the information regarding CF released by the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health. The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems."
傳病媒介疾病科學委員會發表預防及控制基孔肯雅熱共識聲明,2025-08-04 21:06,2025-08-04 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400856.htm,"因應基孔肯雅熱近期在全球多個地區錄得案例急升，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）轄下的傳病媒介疾病科學委員會（科學委員會）今日（八月四日）召開會議，檢視基孔肯雅熱近期的流行病學資料及本港的相應防控策略。科學委員會得悉政府已採取一系列應對基孔肯雅熱的預防措施。

科學委員會的共識聲明為本港提供風險評估，並建議政府持續採取應對措施，以減低基孔肯雅熱輸入個案及本地傳播的風險。

風險評估

基孔肯雅熱由基孔肯雅熱病毒引起，主要透過伊蚊傳播，根據世界衞生組織（世衞）的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱個案。截至今年六月初，全球14個國家／地區共錄得超過22萬宗個案，當中約80宗為死亡個案。基孔肯雅熱在亞洲部分地區流行，與登革熱及寨卡病毒並存。自今年六月底起，廣東省佛山市已錄得超過7 000宗個案，絕大部分個案在順德區錄得。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

本港今年累計錄得一宗基孔肯雅熱個案，屬輸入個案，未有錄得本地個案。由於在夏季期間氣溫及雨量上升，本港蚊患情況可能會加劇，加上市民在暑假會較頻繁前往蚊傳疾病流行的地區，因此再出現輸入個案的風險相當高，並有引致本地傳播的潛在風險。

建議措施

科學委員會認同政府持續採取以下相應防控措施：


加強監測：密切監測全球及鄰近地區的基孔肯雅熱情況，包括透過粵港澳三地傳染病通報機制，以了解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況。持續向醫生和醫院發布最新流行病學資訊，提醒醫護人員應保持警覺。
實驗室檢測：提升本地檢測能力，確保懷疑個案可盡快獲得診斷。
蚊媒監測及滅蚊：部門與各個相關界別合作，在夏季加強蚊媒監測和控制蚊患，並應重點關注高風險地點作跟進；探討控制蚊患方法的最新發展。
個案調查及防控措施：當出現確診個案，迅速展開流行病學調查及病媒調查，並安排病人到醫院，在無蚊環境下接受治療。
口岸防控措施及外遊建議：維持於各個口岸進行巡查，確保有效落實防蚊措施及保持良好環境衞生；與業界持份者保持緊密聯繫並為其提供健康建議；加強對外遊及回港人士的健康教育。
風險溝通和宣傳：透過不同渠道發放有關基孔肯雅熱的資訊和預防措施，並向學校和院舍提供防蚊滅蚊指引。
疫苗成效監察：目前關於現有基孔肯雅熱疫苗的效力和安全性的科學證據尚未足夠。政府應繼續監察世衞和海外衞生當局的最新建議。


​科學委員會確認政府採取的多項應急措施至今有效阻止基孔肯雅熱於本地傳播，並認為面對輸入個案風險，持續實施相關措施十分重要。

Scientific Committee on Vector-borne Diseases releases consensus statement on prevention and control of chikungunya fever,2025-08-04 21:06,2025-08-04 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400857.htm,"In response to the recent spike in chikungunya fever (CF) cases in multiple regions worldwide, the Scientific Committee on Vector-borne Diseases (SCVBD) under the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health convened a meeting today (August 4) to review the recent epidemiological data and corresponding prevention and control strategies for CF in Hong Kong. The SCVBD noted that the Government has already implemented a series of preventive measures against CF.

The consensus statement by the SCVBD provided a risk assessment for Hong Kong and recommended ongoing measures for the Government to mitigate the risk of CF imported cases and potential local transmission.

Risk assessment

CF is caused by the chikungunya virus and is mainly transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. As of early June this year, over 220 000 cases had been reported in 14 countries/regions worldwide. Of these cases, about 80 were fatal. CF is endemic in parts of Asia, with concurrent circulation alongside dengue and Zika viruses. Since the end of June this year, there were over 7 000 cases recorded in Foshan City, Guangdong Province, with majority of cases occurring in Shunde District. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases.

A total of one CF case has been recorded in Hong Kong this year, which is an imported case. No local cases have been recorded. Due to the increase in temperature and rainfall in summer, mosquito infestation might be aggravated in Hong Kong. In addition, members of the public travel more frequently during summer holidays to regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. As a result, Hong Kong has a high risk of occurrence of importation of CF cases again, leading to the potential risk of local transmission.

Recommended measures

The SCVBD endorsed the following ongoing and corresponding preventive and control measures implemented by the Government:


Enhanced Surveillance: maintain close monitoring of global and neighbouring regions' CF situations, including keeping abreast of the latest situation of CF through the communicable disease notification mechanism between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao. Continue to update doctors and hospitals on the latest epidemiological information and remind healthcare professionals to remain vigilant.
Laboratory testing: enhance local testing capabilities to ensure rapid diagnosis of suspected cases.
Vector surveillance and control: departments to collaborate with relevant sectors to strengthen vector surveillance and mosquito control during the summer. Pay attention to high risk spots and follow-up. The Government should also explore the latest development of mosquito control methods.
Case investigation and control measures: conduct prompt epidemiological investigations and vector surveys upon case detection; arrange patients to be admitted to hospital to receive treatment in mosquito-free environments.
Port health measures and travel advice: maintain inspections at boundary control points for vector control and environmental hygiene; maintain close liaison with industry stakeholders and provide health advice to them; strengthen health education for outgoing and returning travellers to affected areas.
Risk communication and publicity: disseminate information on CF and preventive measures through different channels, and provide schools and institutions with guidance on anti-mosquito measures.
Vaccine effectiveness monitoring: there is so far insufficient scientific evidence on efficacy and safety of existing CF vaccines. The Government should monitor the latest recommendations from the WHO and overseas health authorities.


The SCVBD affirmed that Hong Kong's multi-pronged approach on emergency preparedness has effectively prevented local CF transmission to date. Sustained implementation of these measures is crucial to address the importation risk.

The consensus statement of the SCVBD has been uploaded to the CHP website."

尊敬的李大宏董事長（香港大公文匯傳媒集團董事長兼大公報社社長、香港文匯報社社長）、林枬副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室宣傳文體部副部長）、白濤董事長（粤海控股集團有限公司董事長）、黃黑蠻先生（香港警察書畫學會副會長）、姚志勝先生（中國和平統一促進會香港總會會長）、王惠貞女士（王新興有限公司董事總經理）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家下午好！

今天我很榮幸跟大家聚首一堂，一同參加首屆香港「黃永玉」國際青年版畫藝術家扶持計劃的年度展覽開幕典禮。扶持計劃旨在推動中國版畫藝術的國際化發展，挖掘和培養國際青年版畫藝術人才，促進東西方文化藝術交流，為香港建設中外文化藝術交流中心注入強勁動力。為支持扶持計劃，文化體育及旅遊局不單應邀成為扶持計劃的聯合主辦單位，剛才大家也看到了，我亦於今年較早時已經拍攝視頻協助宣傳。

扶持計劃以黃永玉先生命名，黃老是我們祖國當代國寶級藝術家之一，代表作不勝枚舉，享譽海內外。當中，大家剛才從視頻中也看到，作品《春潮》和《阿詩瑪》，它們都是中國版畫經典之作，奠定了黃老在中國版畫界的崇高地位。扶持計劃旨在傳承黃老終身創新、勇於探索的藝術精神，致力挖掘中國各地的青年藝術家並為他們提供展示平台、媒體推廣與學術交流機會。今天我們可以欣賞到約一百名青年藝術家的創作，他們的作品均是經過專家嚴格挑選，在中外近千名青年藝術家中脫穎而出，表現出眾。展覽更特別展出黃老以及其他藝術大師的作品，透過新銳與經典的深度對話，展現中國當代版畫藝術的多元風貌與時代價值。

香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心，擁有獨特的優勢，不僅融匯中外文化，更能將傳統與創新緊密相連。青年藝術家作為文化藝術產業持續發展的生力軍，我期待年輕一代能夠擁抱香港的多樣性和包容性，發揮潛能，進一步激發創意和活力，為中華文化注入更多生機，延續其強大的軟實力。黃老在他一生的藝術實踐中，展現出濃厚的家國情懷與人文精神，年青藝術家亦應當以黃老為學習榜樣，積極拓寬國際視野，在培養世界觀的同時亦應心繫家國，銳意在國際舞台弘揚優秀的中華傳統文化。

食環署因應基孔肯雅熱輸入個案持續加強控蚊滅蚊工作（附圖）,2025-08-04 19:10,2025-08-04 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400789.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）發言人今日（八月四日）表示，就日前出現的基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，食環署聯同各相關部門及持份者繼續加強控蚊滅蚊工作，包括清除地盤及蚊患風險較高地點的積水、殺滅成蚊及進行宣傳教育等。為令防治蚊患工作落到實處，食環署再次呼籲業界繼續加強控蚊滅蚊工作。

食環署自上月起已在全港各區加強防控蚊患措施，以降低基孔肯雅熱等蚊傳疾病的傳播風險。因應日前出現的基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，食環署已即時在個案患者住所250米範圍內進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，包括消除蚊子滋生地及潛在蚊子滋生地，以及於樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊等。另外，各相關部門亦會在轄下的場地及處所持續進行蚊患預防及控制工作，以加強防控效果。食環署亦聯同相關部門及地區人士在當區加強宣傳教育，提高市民防蚊意識。

由於個案患者住所附近的地盤因連日下雨而有積水情況，食環署今日已即時巡查附近一帶共21個建築地盤，並按香港法例第132章《公眾衞生及市政條例》第27條向有積水的地盤承辦商一共發出22張法定通知書，要求有關地盤承辦商負責人必須做好清除蚊子滋生地的工作。承辦商已採取行動跟進，並因應這幾天的降雨量高，清除積水及採取相應措施，例如在積水的地方施放蚊沙等以防止蚊子滋生。食環署會持續監察有關情況。

食環署一直通過巡查及市民投訴等，找出並盡快處理蚊子滋生地。如在地盤或其他處所發現有積水情況，食環署可發出法定通知要求處所負責人跟進；如有證據顯示處所負責人失責導致有蚊子滋生，食環署更可採取檢控行動。直至七月底，食環署今年已提出84宗檢控，包括77宗涉及建築地盤的個案，7宗則涉及其他處所。

今年七月底，環境及生態局及食環署與業界代表會面時，已呼籲在戶外地盤工作的員工提高防蚊意識，採取個人保護措施以避免被蚊叮咬。環境及生態局及食環署期望相關業界持續採取措施，降低疾病傳播風險。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與亦至關重要。食環署繼續呼籲市民攜手合作加強個人防蚊措施，包括：


收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒、空罐和輪胎；及
鋪平或填補不平坦的地面及孔洞。

Under this year's theme ""Digital and AI Transformation toward Prosperity and Sustainable Growth for All"", Professor Sun called for international collaboration to advocate for the safe and responsible adoption of digital and AI technologies, and foster innovation across the region.

  In his speech at the thematic session ""Facilitating Digital and AI Innovation to Address Challenges"", Professor Sun said that AI stands out as the defining force of the time. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has placed AI at the forefront of its strategic agenda and has made meticulous preparations to build the infrastructure and ecosystems needed to thrive in this AI-driven era, including the establishment of the AI Supercomputing Centre by Cyberport, two research clusters under the InnoHK platform, with one of which focusing on AI and robotics technologies and housing the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center, as well as the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute.

  Professor Sun also highlighted that Hong Kong is committed to enhancing public service excellence and promoting economic upgrading and transformation through digital strategies. Advanced digital infrastructures, such as ""iAM Smart"" and the ""Digital Corporate Identity"" platform, will accelerate the development of the digital economy in Hong Kong, delivering greater benefits to people and businesses.

  Speaking at another thematic session, ""Creating a Safe and Trustworthy Digital and AI Ecosystem"", Professor Sun pointed out that the powerful capability of AI is a double-edged sword, and that a strategic, vigilant and responsible deployment of AI is imperative for all governments and organisations. Hong Kong has been closely working with professional international cybersecurity organisations to respond quickly and proactively to the latest cyber threats and attacks.

  He added that good governance is the cornerstone of a safe, responsible and trustworthy AI ecosystem. Hong Kong has developed in line with global best practices Hong Kong's own Ethical Artificial Intelligence Framework and Generative Artificial Intelligence Technical and Application Guideline, to promote responsible and healthy development of AI technology, balancing its cutting-edge progress with accountability, accuracy and security.

  Professor Sun called upon APEC member economies to combat cyber threats and harness AI's full potential through mutual understanding and collaboration.

  In the joint ministerial statement adopted by the APEC DMM, the ministers recognised the need to address emerging opportunities and challenges in the rapidly evolving digital landscape, and reaffirmed their strong commitment to explore collaborative approaches to ensure the use of information and communications technology and digital innovations for the benefit of people and the entire Asia-Pacific region.

  During the ministerial meeting, Professor Sun had an in-depth exchange with the Meeting Chair and the Minister of Science and ICT, Republic of Korea, Mr Bae Kyunghoon, on how to promote co-operation between Hong Kong and Korea in technological innovation and information technology. He also had brief exchanges with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Digital Economy and Society of Thailand, Mr Prasert Jantararuangtong, and the Secretariat General of the Ministry of Communications and Digital Affairs of Indonesia, Mr Ismail Achmad.

  Before attending the DMM today, Professor Sun participated in a ministerial breakfast meeting on promoting AI adoption and empowerment. He also attended the ministers' welcome reception of the APEC DMM in the evening.

  In addition, Professor Sun met with Vice Minister of Industry and Information Technology Mr Xiong Jijun at the venue. At the meeting, Professor Sun briefed Mr Xiong on the HKSAR Government's plan and latest work on leading the development of the city's innovation and technology industry and new industrialisation. They also discussed the latest progress in the implementation of various initiatives since the signing of the Co-operation Agreement on the Development of New Quality Productive Forces and the Promotion of New Industrialisation between the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the HKSAR Government in September last year.

  Professor Sun will continue his visit to Korea tomorrow (Aug 5)."

本港今年累計錄得一宗基孔肯雅熱個案，屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為輸入個案。

中心港口衞生科已在各個口岸加強有關基孔肯雅熱的宣傳教育工作，加強巡查四周確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施，港口衞生科人員今日聯同香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵）人員到港鐵落馬洲站及附近範圍視察，並建議防控蚊患措施。此外，人員亦會為抵港人士進行體溫篩查，為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，並在有需要時轉介他們到醫院作出跟進。中心亦會與航空公司和旅遊業界等持份者保持緊密聯繫，適時更新疾病資訊和健康建議。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況，留意發燒、關節痛或皮疹等症狀。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節，以便醫生作出臨床診斷，並按個別病人情況安排適當檢測。市民切勿自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）已加強確診病人的住所及於病發後曾到訪地點的防蚊滅蚊工作。同時，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

CHP announces no new confirmed chikungunya fever infection cases today (with photos),2025-08-04 18:25,2025-08-04 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400695.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 4) said that no new confirmed chikungunya fever (CF) infection cases had been recorded as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the recent CF case. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

A total of one CF case has been recorded in Hong Kong this year, which is an imported case. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

The CHP's Port Health Division has stepped up publicity and education efforts regarding CF at boundary control points, conducting more frequent inspections to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Staff members today conducted inspection at MTR Lok Ma Chau Station and its vicinity with staff members of the MTR Corporation Limited and recommended anti-mosquito measures. In addition, staff members also conduct temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fever or related symptoms will be assessed for their health condition and referred to hospitals for follow-up when necessary. The CHP also maintains close liaison with relevant stakeholders, such as airlines and the travel industry, to provide the latest disease information and health advice in a timely manner.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public that if they return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. Members of the public should closely observe their personal health condition, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrange appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has intensified anti-mosquito measures at the residence of the confirmed patient and the locations visited after the onset of illness. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces as well as removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The latest gravidtrap indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas are available on the department website at:www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Ovitrap_Index_Update.html#.

The CHP will collaborate with the FEHD to hold an online live seminar on itsFacebook pagetomorrow (August 5) from 8pm to 8.30pm, to provide information and health advice on preventing mosquito bites and controlling mosquito breeding, as well as addressing related public enquiries. Members of the public are welcome to attend.

Mr Lee welcomed Mr Khodjaev and his delegation to Hong Kong. Noting that the economic and trade relations between Hong Kong and Uzbekistan have grown steadily in recent years, Mr Lee said that there is potential for the two places to jointly explore more co-operation opportunities. Hong Kong enjoys the advantage of connecting the Mainland and the world under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, actively serving as a functional platform for the Belt and Road Initiative. Uzbekistan has seen significant infrastructure development, and Hong Kong enterprises and talent, with extensive experience in this area, can offer construction technologies and financing channels. Mr Lee encouraged Uzbek enterprises to leverage Hong Kong's highly internationalised and market-oriented business environment with its pool of professional services talent to explore overseas and Mainland markets, achieving mutual benefits.

Noting that Hong Kong is striving to develop into an international hub for post-secondary education, Mr Lee highlighted that Hong Kong offers a Belt and Road Scholarship to encourage students from Belt and Road countries or regions to pursue studies in the city, aiming to attract more talent to Hong Kong. He welcomed more young people of Uzbekistan to study and develop their careers in Hong Kong, fostering greater youth and cultural exchanges between the two places."

多雨及韋帕襲港的七月,2025-08-04 17:00,2025-08-04 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400310.htm,"經歷異常少雨的上半年後，受到月初熱帶氣旋丹娜絲的殘餘雨帶、月中颱風韋帕，以及月內數度低壓槽及活躍西南季候風相關驟雨的影響，香港七月終於迎來較為顯著的降雨。韋帕襲港亦令天文台需要在七月二十日發出十號颶風信號。七月總雨量為601.7毫米，較正常值385.8毫米高約百分之五十六。然而，由於上半年的雨量遠低於正常，本年首七個月的累積雨量只有1 046.1毫米，仍較同期正常值1 468.2毫米少約百分之二十九。七月亦較正常炎熱，平均最高氣溫32.4度，較正常值高0.8度，是有紀錄以來七月份的其中一個第九高。平均氣溫29.5度及平均最低氣溫27.4度，分別較正常值高0.6度及0.5度。

一道廣闊低壓槽及高空擾動於七月一日為本港帶來驟雨及雷暴。南丫島及新界東北部錄得超過40毫米雨量。隨着華南上空的反氣旋建立，隨後三日本港普遍晴朗及酷熱，但局部地區有驟雨及雷暴。

此外，熱帶低氣壓丹娜絲於七月四日早上在南海東北部形成，緩慢向西北移動，翌日轉向東北移動。丹娜絲於七月六日逐步增強為強颱風，並於當晚在台灣西部沿岸登陸。丹娜絲隨後進入東海，並逐步減弱為熱帶風暴。本港方面，除局部地區有驟雨及狂風雷暴外，七月五日至七日陽光充沛及極端酷熱，多處地區的氣溫上升至約35度。七月七日天文台錄得最高氣溫34.3度，是有記錄以來最熱的小暑。

受一股西南氣流影響，七月八至九日本港持續酷熱，天氣夾雜陽光及驟雨。與此同時，丹娜絲於七月八日在東海再次轉向，並於當晚在浙江省溫州市附近登陸。丹娜絲最後在七月九日晚上於福建減弱為低壓區，其殘餘繼續向西南移動並靠近廣東。受丹娜絲的殘餘及一股活躍西南季候風影響，七月九日晚上及七月十日至十二日本港有連場驟雨及雷暴。七月九日晚上及七月十日的雨勢特別大，本港普遍錄得超過100毫米雨量，而荃灣及青衣的雨量更超過200毫米。期間天文台曾三度發出紅色暴雨警告。受大雨影響，天文台氣溫於七月十日早上下降至全月最低的25.0度。七月十三日至十五日香港雖然仍有驟雨及雷暴，但受高空反氣旋影響，天氣酷熱及部分時間有陽光。

七月十六日至十七日本港普遍晴朗，日間極端酷熱。在微風的情況下，高溫天氣於七月十八日日間觸發大驟雨及雷暴。本港多處地區錄得超過30毫雨量，而中午元朗區錄得一小時超過100毫米的大暴雨。

此外，熱帶低氣壓韋帕於七月十六日在菲律賓以東海域形成。韋帕隨後向西北移向呂宋海峽，並於七月十八日增強為熱帶風暴。七月十九日韋帕橫過南海北部，並於當晚增強為颱風。韋帕於七月二十日接近中午時分在香港天文台以南約60公里掠過，隨後橫過廣東西部沿岸一帶，移向北部灣。

受韋帕的外圍下沉氣流影響，七月十九日本港酷熱及部分時間有陽光。隨着韋帕逐漸靠近廣東沿岸，其外圍雨帶於當晚開始為本港帶來狂風驟雨及雷暴。七月二十日韋帕相當接近本港，日間多處地區吹暴風至颶風。橫瀾島及長洲錄得的最高60分鐘平均風速分別為每小時131公里及115公里。隨着韋帕遠離及逐漸減弱，七月二十日稍後本港風勢逐漸緩和。當日本港普遍錄得超過70毫米雨量，而部分地區的雨量更超過200毫米。根據初步資料，超過33人在韋帕襲港期間受傷。全港有至少2 284宗塌樹報告、七宗水浸及五宗棚架倒塌報告。香港國際機場有超過500班航班取消。受韋帕相關的外圍雨帶影響，七月二十一日本港仍然間中有驟雨及狂風雷暴。

七月二十二日一道廣闊低壓槽影響廣東沿岸及南海北部。當晚的大驟雨普遍為本港帶來超過40毫米雨量。七月二十三日至二十七日本港日間普遍晴朗及持續酷熱。七月二十六日下午天文台氣溫上升至全月最高的35.2度。高溫天氣亦於七月二十三日至二十五日觸發驟雨及狂風雷暴。七月二十五日黃昏的大雷雨為本港部分地區帶來超過50毫米雨量，而西貢區的雨量更超過90毫米。西貢亦曾錄得每小時約110公里的猛烈陣風。

七月二十八日初時本港天氣酷熱及短暫時間有陽光，但隨着雷雨區靠近沿岸地區，當日稍後間中有驟雨及幾陣雷暴。一道廣闊低壓槽於七月二十九日至三十日間中為本港帶來驟雨及雷暴。七月二十九日早上的傾盆大雨令天文台需要發出本年首個黑色暴雨警告。當日多處錄得超過70毫米雨量，而港島東部、西貢區及南丫島的雨量超過200毫米。全港有八宗水浸報告。受一股西南氣流影響，七月最後一日本港天氣夾雜陽光及驟雨。

二○二五年七月有八個熱帶氣旋影響南海及北太平洋西部。

A rainy July with strike of Wipha,2025-08-04 17:00,2025-08-04 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400308.htm,"After a very dry first half of the year, more significant rainfall eventually returned to Hong Kong in July 2025, mainly due to the passage of the remnant of tropical cyclone Danas in early July and typhoon Wipha in mid-July, as well as showers associated with troughs of low pressure and active southwesterly airstreams during the month. Also, the strike of Wipha necessitated the issuance of the Hurricane Signal No. 10 on July 20. The monthly rainfall was 601.7 millimetres, about 56 per cent above the normal of 385.8 millimetres. However, with the rainfall well below normal in the first half of the year, the accumulated rainfall recorded in the first seven months of the year was only 1 046.1 millimetres, still a deficit of 29 per cent compared to the normal of 1 468.2 millimetres for the same period. The month was also warmer than usual with the monthly mean maximum temperature of 32.4 degrees, 0.8 degrees above the normal and one of the ninth highest on record for July. The monthly mean temperature of 29.5 degrees and monthly mean minimum temperature of 27.4 degrees were 0.6 degrees and 0.5 degrees above their respective normals.

A broad trough of low pressure and upper-air disturbances brought showers and thunderstorms to Hong Kong on the first day of the month. More than 40 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over Lamma Island and the northeastern part of the New Territories. With the establishment of an anticyclone aloft over southern China, apart from isolated showers and thunderstorms, the weather was generally fine and very hot in the following three days.

Moreover, Danas formed as a tropical depression over the northeastern part of the South China Sea on the morning of July 4 and moved northwestwards slowly. It turned to move northeastwards on the next day. Danas intensified progressively into a severe typhoon and made landfall over the western coast of Taiwan on the night of July 6. Danas then entered the East China Sea and weakened progressively into a tropical storm. Locally, apart from isolated showers and squally thunderstorms, it was sunny and extremely hot from July 5 to 7. Temperatures over many places rose to around 35 degrees. On July 7, the maximum temperature recorded at the Observatory was 34.3 degrees, the hottest Moderate Heat ever recorded.

Under the influence of a southwesterly airstream, the weather remained very hot with a mixture of sunshine and showers on July 8 and 9. Meanwhile, Danas made a second sharp turn over the East China Sea on July 8, and made landfall near Wenzhou, Zhejiang, that night. It finally degenerated into an area of low pressure over Fujian on the night of July 9. The remnant of Danas continued to track southwestwards and edge closer to Guangdong. Under the influence of the remnant of Danas and an active southwest monsoon, there were outbreaks of showers and thunderstorms on the night of July 9, and from July 10 to 12. Showers were particularly heavy on the night of July 9 and 10, and more than 100 millimetres of rainfall were generally recorded over the territory. Rainfall even exceeded 200 millimetres over Tsuen Wan and Tsing Yi. The Red Rainstorm Warning was issued three times during the period. Under the heavy rain, temperatures at the Hong Kong Observatory also fell to a minimum of 25.0 degrees on the morning of July 10, the lowest of the month. While there were still showers and thunderstorms from July 13 to 15, it was also very hot with sunny periods under the influence of an anticyclone aloft.

The weather was generally fine and extremely hot during the days on July 16 and 17. Under light wind conditions, heavy showers and thunderstorms triggered by high temperatures affected Hong Kong during the day on July 18. More than 30 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over many places and a severe rainstorm of more than 100 millimetres of hourly rainfall were recorded over Yuen Long District at noon.

Furthermore, Wipha formed as a tropical depression over the seas east of the Philippines on July 16. It then tracked northwestwards towards the Luzon Strait and intensified into a tropical storm on July 18. Wipha moved across the northern part of the South China Sea on July 19 and intensified into a typhoon at night. It skirted about 60 kilometres south of the Hong Kong Observatory towards noon on July 20 and moved across the vicinity of the coast of western Guangdong and towards Beibu Wan afterwards.

Locally, it was very hot with sunny periods on July 19 under the influence of Wipha's outer subsiding air. With Wipha edging closer to the coast of Guangdong gradually, its outer rainbands started to bring squally showers and thunderstorms to the territory at night. As Wipha came quite close to Hong Kong on July 20, many places were affected by storm to hurricane force winds during the day. The maximum 60-minute mean wind speeds recorded at Waglan Island and Cheung Chau were 131km per hour and 115km per hour respectively. With Wipha departing from Hong Kong and weakening gradually, local winds moderated later on July 20. More than 70 millimetres of rainfall were generally recorded over Hong Kong on July 20, and rainfall even exceeded 200 millimetres over parts of the territory. According to preliminary reports, more than 33 people were injured during the passage of Wipha. There were at least 2 284 reports of fallen trees, seven reports of flooding and five reports of collapsed scaffolding. More than 500 flights were cancelled at Hong Kong International Airport. Under the influence of the outer rainbands associated with Wipha, there were still occasional showers and squally thunderstorms on July 21.

A broad trough of low pressure affected the coast of Guangdong and the northern part of the South China Sea on July 22. Locally, the heavy showers on the night of July 22 generally brought more than 40 millimetres of rainfall to the territory. Local weather was generally fine with prolonged heat during the day from July 23 to 27. The maximum temperature at the Observatory rose to 35.2 degrees on the afternoon of July 26, the highest of the month. High temperatures also triggered showers and squally thunderstorms from July 23 to 25. Heavy thundery showers on the evening of July 25 brought more than 50 millimetres of rainfall to parts of the territory, and rainfall even exceeded 90 millimetres over Sai Kung District. Violent gusts of around 110km per hour were recorded at Sai Kung.

While it was very hot with sunny intervals at first on July 28, with an area of thundery showers edging closer to the coastal areas, there were occasional showers and a few thunderstorms later on that day. A broad trough of low pressure brought occasional showers and thunderstorms to Hong Kong on July 29 and 30. The heavy downpour on the morning of July 29 necessitated the issuance of the first Black Rainstorm Warning of the year. More than 70 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over many places, and rainfall even exceeded 200 millimetres over the eastern part of Hong Kong Island, Sai Kung District and Lamma Island. There were eight reports of flooding in Hong Kong. Under the influence of a southwesterly airstream, the weather of Hong Kong was a mixture of sunshine and showers on the last day of the month.

Eight tropical cyclones occurred over the South China Sea and the western North Pacific in July 2025.

Details of issuance and cancellation of various warnings/signals in the month are summarised in Table 1. Monthly meteorological figures and departures from normal for July are tabulated in Table 2."

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-08-04 16:30,2025-08-04 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400523.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (August 4) reported the latest number of cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD), and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From July 27 to August 2, the CHP recorded six community-acquired LD cases. The details of the cases are as follows:


A 54-year-old female patient with underlying illnesses living in Eastern District;
A 60-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Wong Tai Sin District;
A 60-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Eastern District;
An 85-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Tuen Mun District;
A 67-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Sai Kung District; and
An 88-year-old female patient with underlying illnesses living in Central and Western District.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigation revealed that all six cases are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of August 2, 96 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.

â
âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

商務及經濟發展局局長在烏茲別克斯坦--中國香港商務論壇致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-08-04 16:20,2025-08-04 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400618.htm,"以下是商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺今日（八月四日）在烏茲別克斯坦—中國香港商務論壇（投資與綠色產業發展）的致辭全文：

烏茲別克斯坦副總理霍賈耶夫（烏茲別克斯坦副總理霍賈耶夫．賈姆希德）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家下午好。非常榮幸出席今日的論壇，讓我們能夠深入了解烏茲別克斯坦的重大商機，這對促進兩地經貿合作具有重要意義。

烏茲別克斯坦是中亞地區的經濟引擎，擁有豐富的天然資源和龐大的勞動力市場。它不僅是中亞地區人口最多的國家，也是經濟增長最快的國家之一，近年來GDP增長率一直保持在6%以上。烏茲別克斯坦是古絲綢之路的重要樞紐，如今更成為了「一帶一路」倡議在中亞地區的關鍵國家。近年不斷深化國內改革，積極對外開放，為外資企業提供了廣闊的市場空間。

談到「一帶一路」倡議，它是我國推動國際合作的重要戰略，涵蓋政策溝通、設施聯通、貿易暢通、資金融通和民心相通五大領域。烏茲別克斯坦早在二○一三年就非常支持此倡議。在二○二三年，烏茲別克斯坦總統親臨出席我國舉辦的第三屆「一帶一路」國際合作高峰論壇，並與習主席會見。烏方明確表示希望在「一帶一路」框架下深化經貿投資、互聯互通、新能源、農業和人文等領域的合作，共同推進「綠色絲綢之路」建設。

香港作為國際金融和貿易中心，在「一國兩制」下擁有獨特優勢，在促進區域合作中扮演重要角色。我們不僅是連接內地與世界的橋樑，香港的法治環境、簡單稅制、專業服務和多元文化，也為企業提供了理想的營商環境，是烏茲別克斯坦企業和投資者不可缺少的門戶。特別是在粵港澳大灣區發展戰略的推動下，香港正迎來新的發展機遇。我們將繼續發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，協助內地企業「走出去」，也歡迎外資企業「走進來」，實現互利共贏。

事實上，香港在全球主要經濟指數中表現名列前茅，我們被菲沙研究所評為全球最自由經濟體，並在國際管理發展學院的全球競爭力排名中位居前三。更重要的是，香港是唯一一個同時參與「一帶一路」倡議和CEPA（《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》）的國際城市，這使我們能夠無縫連接中國內地與全球市場，為企業提供獨特的發展平台。

我知道我國在烏茲別克斯坦已建立多個境外經貿合作區，包括經國家商務部認定的鵬盛工業園。此外，中國絲路基金還設立了中烏共同投資平台，意向出資金額達50億元人民幣，重點關注基礎設施、可再生能源、醫療健康和數字經濟等領域的投資機會，為兩國企業合作提供了實質性支持。

二○二四年，烏茲別克斯坦已成為香港在中亞地區的第二大貿易夥伴。我認為烏茲別克斯坦作為中亞區域樞紐，與香港作為亞洲互聯互通樞紐的定位，可以形成優勢互補的合作關係。這種合作將涵蓋金融、貿易、航空、數字經濟、綠色倡議、文化和教育等多個領域，真正實現互利共贏。

我想在此介紹一下，今年九月香港將舉辦第十屆「一帶一路高峰論壇」，是「一帶一路」倡議下最具影響力的年度盛事，我誠邀烏茲別克斯坦的政商各界朋友來港參加，共同探討合作機會，開拓新的商機。

展望未來，香港將繼續深化與烏茲別克斯坦的經貿合作。我鼓勵更多烏茲別克斯坦企業來港投資，利用香港的國際優勢開拓內地及全球市場。投資推廣署設在哈薩克斯坦阿拉木圖的顧問辦事處將繼續與中亞地區的相關機構合作，舉辦更多投資推廣活動，促進兩地經濟共同繁榮，為區域發展作出更大貢獻。

最後，我祝願本次論壇圓滿成功。"

It is my privilege to address this esteemed assembly on the topic that unites us all - fostering a safe and trustworthy digital and AI ecosystem. 

As we all recognise, AI is reshaping our world at lightning speed. From transforming industries to optimising operations across sectors, AI has demonstrated its boundless potential in this increasingly digital world.

Today, AI technologies play a pivotal role in cyber defence. By leveraging advanced algorithms and real-time data analysis, AI-enabled systems can detect anomalies, neutralise threats, mitigate risks and respond swiftly to potential intrusions. However, this powerful capability is a double-edged sword.

While AI empowers us to respond faster than ever, it also equips malicious actors with unprecedented tools. Cybercriminals could now ""weaponise"" AI to launch cyberattacks that aremore sophisticated, more scalable, and harder to detect.This is not a hypothetical threat but is happening now. This is why a strategic, vigilant, and responsible deployment of AI is imperative for all governments and organisations.

In Hong Kong, China, we are taking action. For over two decades, the Hong Kong Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Centre, or HKCERT in short, has been standing at the forefront of our cybersecurity efforts. Last year, the HKCERT introduced AI-driven applications that detect and remove phishing URLs and alert the public to emerging risks. We have also been closely working with international cybersecurity professional organisations to respond quickly to the latest cyber threats and attacks. But technology alone is not enough.

Awareness is our first line of defence. We have implemented a Government-wide Phishing Drill Campaign using AI to simulate attacks and train our teams. We have also equipped our people with tools like a ""Scameter"" and a ""CyberDefender"", and turned our people into smart and vigilant e-citizens who are ready to navigate the digital world safely.

Indeed, good governance is the cornerstone of a safe, responsible and trustworthy AI ecosystem. That is why we have developed in line with global best practices Hong Kong, China's own Ethical AI Framework and our Generative Artificial Intelligence Technical and Application Guideline. These are not just documents but blueprints for promoting responsible and healthy development of AI technology in Hong Kong, China, balancing its cutting-edge progress with accountability, accuracy and security.

Cyber threats do not respect borders, and neither should our solutions. International collaboration is non-negotiable. Only through mutual understanding and collaboration can we succeed in combating cyber threats effectively and harnessing AI's full potential. Hong Kong, China stands ready to work with all member economies together to build a digital future where innovation thrives, risks are managed, and trust is guaranteed. A future where AI does not just serve the few but safeguards and empowers everyone. Thank you."

This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

Employers and employees should make work arrangements in times of rainstorm warnings,2025-08-04 12:37,2025-08-04 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400381.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (August 4) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions as early as possible, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of organisations, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

  ""Employers should make prior work arrangements and contingency measures for staff which are reasonably practicable. In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

  To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or extreme conditions come to an end, when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather or extreme conditions.

  ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.

  If a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.

  If the Government makes an extreme conditions announcement, apart from those required by employers to report for duty at workplaces, employees are advised to stay in the place they are currently in or in safe places when extreme conditions are in force, instead of heading for work. Employees who have already reported for duty at workplaces could continue to work as usual in a safe manner. If the workplaces are in danger, employers should release staff from work early under feasible conditions and in a safe manner or make available a safe place as temporary shelter for employees. If the working time ends while extreme conditions are still in force, employers can release employees from workplaces in a safe manner or provide a suitable area as temporary shelter for those still at workplaces.

  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.

  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.
 
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."
僱主僱員應訂立暴雨警告下的工作安排,2025-08-04 12:33,2025-08-04 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400385.htm,"勞工處今日（八月四日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在暴雨警告下及極端情況及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以保障僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主應預先制定合理而可行的工作安排和應變措施。在擬訂及執行有關安排時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮當中的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在暴雨警告或極端情況下及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。」

如果紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外或空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如政府作出極端情況公布，除與僱主就此情況下已訂立返回工作地點上班協定的人員外，僱員應留在原來的地點或安全地點，不要啓程上班。已在工作地點當值的僱員，在安全情況下可如常工作；如工作地點有危險，在可行及安全的情況下，僱主應安排僱員提早下班或到安全的地方暫避。如工作時間在極端情況生效期間結束，僱主應在安全情況下安排僱員下班，或開放合適地方讓仍在工作地點的僱員暫避。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣及極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人亦提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"

  Good morning, chair and distinguished fellow colleagues.

  On behalf of Hong Kong, China, I would like to begin by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to Korea for the warm hospitality and impeccable arrangements for this meeting. It is an honour to stand among leaders who share a common vision - harnessing digital and AI innovation to address the profound socio-economic challenges across the Asia-Pacific region with precision, impact and inclusivity.

  AI is not just the future. It is the here and now. Among the emerging technologies reshaping our world, AI stands out as the defining force of our time. The numbers speak for themselves. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, AI is projected to become a US$4.8 trillion global market by 2033. This is not just an opportunity but a call to action. In Hong Kong, China, AI is at the forefront of our strategic agenda, as set out in the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint. The blueprint underscores our commitment to turning ambition into action by advancing infrastructure, fostering cutting-edge research, and supporting enterprise innovation, thereby harnessing the power of AI to drive economic transformation, strengthen our tech-powered economy, and secure a sustainable future.

  To realise this vision, Hong Kong, China has made meticulous preparations to build the infrastructure and ecosystems needed to thrive in this AI-driven era. Among them, Cyberport, one of our major tech flagships, has set up an AI Supercomputing Centre to support the growing local demand for high performance computing power. We have also established two research clusters under our InnoHK platform, one of which focuses on AI and robotics technologies and houses the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center (HKGAI), which developed Hong Kong's first large language foundation model.

  Here is what is more exciting. The HKGAI is set to launch the ""HKChat"", an AI-powered chatbot mobile app powered by our homegrown large language foundation model, bringing the benefits of AI directly to the public this year. Alongside setting up the Hong Kong AI R&D (research and development) Institute, we are doubling down on the R&D and industrial applications of AI.

  But we are not stopping there. Digital transformation is equally central to Hong Kong, China's strategy for public service excellence, economic upgrading and transformation. Our ""iAM Smart"" one-stop personalised digital services platform has already transformed how our people access government and commercial online services, providing a seamless, secure and efficient experience. By 2025, it will be the single portal for all online government services. And by the end of 2026, we will have rolled out the ""Digital Corporate Identity"" platform, which is set to be a game changer for businesses by enabling secure, convenient and frictionless transactions. We are confident that these advanced digital infrastructures will accelerate the development of the digital economy in Hong Kong, China, delivering greater benefits to our people and businesses.

  The promise of digital and AI innovation demands collaboration. Hong Kong, China stands ready to play a more constructive role in advancing this collective vision, advocating for the safe and responsible adoption of AI, ICT (information and communications technology) and digital technologies. By working together, we can boost productivity and efficiency, strengthen resilience, and foster innovation across the region. Let us seize this moment to drive inclusive growth, deepen regional ties, and secure a prosperous and sustainable future for every citizen in the Asia-Pacific region.

  Thank you."

根據《維護國家安全條例》指明危害國家安全罪行的潛逃者及指明針對有關潛逃者施行的措施,2025-08-04 11:35,2025-08-04 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400300.htm,"保安局局長於今日（八月四日）行使《維護國家安全條例》（2024年第6號）第89（1）條及第89（4）條所賦予的權力，藉在憲報刊登公告，指明十六名因涉嫌在香港特別行政區（特區）境外干犯危害國家安全罪行而被法院發出拘捕令的人，並指明針對這十六名有關潛逃者施行的措施。有關詳情列於2025年第43號號外公告及第44號號外公告。

十六名被指明的有關潛逃者為男子何良懋、女子陳麗珍、男子馮崇義、女子龔小夏、男子吳文昕、男子曾偉藩、女子錢寶芬、男子夏海俊、男子侯中宇、男子何永友、男子姜嘉偉、男子林千淦、女子吳文君、男子黃振華、男子黃修和及女子張信燕，各人在香港境外一直從事危害國家安全的行為和活動。

警務處國家安全處已於七月二十五日公布懸紅通緝上述十六名潛逃者以及男子袁弓夷、男子霍嘉誌、男子蔡明達。這十九名潛逃者在境外籌組、成立或參與一個名為「香港議會」的顛覆組織，涉嫌干犯《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區維護國家安全法》罪行。法院已應警方的申請，就上述十九名在逃人士發出拘捕令。

在上述在逃人士當中，保安局局長已於二○二四年六月和十二月先後行使《維護國家安全條例》第89條所賦予的權力，刊憲指明袁弓夷、霍嘉誌及蔡明達為潛逃者，並指明針對他們而施行的措施。

以下三項措施，就全部十六名今日被指明的有關潛逃者而適用：「禁止提供資金等或處理資金等」、「禁止與不動產相關的某些活動」及「與涉及有關潛逃者的合資企業或合夥相關的禁止」，而「撤銷特區護照等」亦適用於大部分有關潛逃者。此外，「暫時罷免董事職位」的措施，就個別有關潛逃者而適用。有關潛逃者涉嫌干犯的危害國家安全罪行及針對有關潛逃者而施行的措施詳列於附件。

政府發言人強調 : 「這些無法無天的通緝犯潛藏英國、美國、加拿大、德國、澳洲、泰國、中國台灣等地，並在當地繼續公然從事危害國家安全的勾當，並透過抹黑詆毀意圖煽動對中央和香港特區的憎恨，我們因此有需要採取是次措施強烈打擊。」

警方提醒市民，除獲得保安局局長批予的特許授權外，任何人直接或間接向有關潛逃者提供任何資金或其他財務資產或經濟資源（包括向有關潛逃者在網上建立的平台或專頁提供資金），或處理屬於或由其擁有或控制的任何資金或其他財務資產或經濟資源；將不動產租賃予或以其它方式提供予有關潛逃者，或向其租入不動產；與有關潛逃者成立合資企業、合夥或類似的關係，或投資於該等關係，即屬犯罪，一經定罪可處監禁七年。警方會對相關犯罪行為嚴正執法，呼籲社會大眾不要以身試法。

保安局局長已要求警方整理相關證據，以供其考慮行使《維護國家安全條例》第60條下的權力，禁止「香港議會」及「香港民主建國聯盟」在香港運作。"
Specification of absconders in respect of offences endangering national security and specification of measures applicable against relevant absconders under Safeguarding National Security Ordinance,2025-08-04 11:35,2025-08-04 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400303.htm," The Secretary for Security exercised the powers conferred by sections 89(1) and 89(4) of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (6 of 2024) today (August 4) to specify 16 persons who are subject to warrants of arrest issued by the court for being suspected of having committed offences endangering national security outside the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and to specify the measures to be applied against the 16 relevant absconders by notices published in the Gazette. Details are set out in G.N. (E.) 43 of 2025 and G.N. (E.) 44 of 2025.

 The 16 specified relevant absconders are male Ho Leung-mau Victor, female Chan Lai-chun, male Feng Chongyi, female Gong Sasha, male Ng Man-yan, male Tsang Wai-fan, female Chin Po-fun, male Ha Hoi-chun, Paul, male Hau Chung-yu, male Ho Wing-yau, male Keung Ka-wai, male Lam Tony, female Ng Agnes, male Wong Chun-wah, male Wong Sau-wo and female Zhang Xinyan. All of them have persistently engaged in acts and activities endangering national security outside the HKSAR.

 The National Security Department of the Hong Kong Police Forceannounced on July 25 that the above-mentioned 16 absconders and male Yuan Gong-yi, male Fok Ka-chi, male Choi Ming-da were put on the wanted list, with rewards offered in respect of each wanted person. These 19 absconders are suspected of committing offences under the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong National Security Law) by organising, establishing, or participating in, outside the HKSAR, a subversive organisation named the ""Hong Kong Parliament"".The court has, upon application by the Police, issued arrest warrants against these 19 persons at large.

 Among the aforementioned fugitives, the Secretary for Security had already exercised powers conferred by section 89 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, in June and December 2024, to specify Yuan Gong-yi, Fok Ka-chi and Choi Ming-da as absconders and to specify the measures to be applied against them by notices published in the Gazette.

 The following three measures are applicable to all 16 relevant absconders specified today: ""Prohibition against making available funds etc. or dealing with funds etc."", ""Prohibition against certain activities in connection with immovable property"" and ""Prohibition in connection with joint ventures or partnerships with relevant absconders""; while the measure of ""Cancellation of HKSAR passports etc."" is applicable to most relevant absconders. In addition, the measure of ""Temporary removal from office of director"" is applicable to individual relevant absconders. The offences endangering national security suspected to have been committed by the relevant absconders and the measures applied against the relevant absconders are detailed in the Annex.

 A Government spokesperson stressed that, ""These lawless wanted criminals are hiding in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Germany, Australia, Thailand, China's Taiwan region, etc, and continue to blatantly engage in activities that endanger national security. They also intended to incite hatred through smear and slander against the Central Authorities and the HKSAR. We therefore have taken such measures to make a significant impact.""

 The Police remind members of the public that, except under the authority of a licence granted by the Secretary for Security, any person, whether directly or indirectly, making available any funds or other financial assets or economic resources to a relevant absconder (including the provision of funds to online platforms or dedicated pages established by the relevant absconders), or dealing with any funds or other financial assets or economic resources belonging to, or owned or controlled by, a relevant absconder; leasing, or otherwise making available, immovable property to a relevant absconder, or leasing immovable property from a relevant absconder; or establishing a joint venture, partnership or any like relationship with a relevant absconder, or investing in such a joint venture, partnership or any like relationship, commits an offence and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for seven years. The Police will take strict enforcement action against the relevant offences. Members of the public are advised not to break the law.

 The Secretary for Security has instructed the Police to sort out the relevant evidence for him to consider exercising the power under section 60 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance to prohibit the operation of the ""Hong Kong Parliament"" and the ""Hong Kong Democratic Independence Union"" in the HKSAR."

僱主／承建商及僱員須注意在暴雨下工作時的電力安全,2025-08-04 06:31,2025-08-04 06:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400135.htm,"鑑於天文台已發出暴雨警告，勞工處提醒僱主及承建商，當僱員在進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置時，須採取所需的工作安排及適當安全措施，以保障僱員的工作安全。

勞工處發言人今日（八月四日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

勞工處印備了安全指南及單張，提供有關電力工作的安全指引。這些安全刊物可在該處各分區辦事處免費索取，亦可從該處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/content2_8.htm）下載。

如有任何有關職業安全及健康的問題，可致電2559 2297，與勞工處職業安全主任聯絡。"
"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-08-04 06:31,2025-08-04 06:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400133.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (August 4) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."
