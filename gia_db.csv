政府公布跟進大埔火災最新情況,2025-12-13 21:08,2025-12-13 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/13/P2025121300757.htm,"政府就大埔宏福苑火災成立的三個工作組——調查及規管工作組、緊急支援及募捐工作組，以及應急住宿安排工作組——正全力持續跟進火災的支援、善後及調查事宜，詳情如下：

經濟及福利援助
———————

截至今日（十二月十三日）中午，政府成立的「大埔宏福苑援助基金」已收到的外界捐款約34億元，連同政府投入的三億元啓動資金，基金總額約為37億元，會用在協助居民重建家園，是長期和持續的支援。

住宿援助
————

截至今日上午，共有1 392名居民入住由民政及青年事務局協調的青年宿舍／營舍或酒店房間；另有3 163名居民現居於房屋局的過渡性房屋或香港房屋協會（房協）項目的單位。

考慮到受火災影響居民非常緊急的情況，房屋局早前已作出特別安排，對入住過渡性房屋或房協項目的受影響居民提供住宿援助，租金全免。換句話說，如有需要，受影響的居民可以較長期入住。政府會在住宿方面一直支援受影響居民，有需要的居民無需擔心相關租金開支或居住期。

此外，過渡性房屋營運機構及房協的職員和義工日以繼夜全力為單位添置生活所需物資。以洪水橋樂翹樓為例，入住時單位均配備床架、床褥、枕頭、煮食爐、熱水爐等家具電器，更提供廁紙、拖鞋、簡單清潔用品等，希望協助受影響居民盡快安頓。

同時，不少團體主動派駐人手到部分項目為有需要的居民提供不同方面的支援，例如免費醫療和法律諮詢服務。政府亦已在18個有較多居民入住的項目設立服務站，為有需要的居民提供諮詢與支援服務，與居民同行。

物資援助／捐獻
———————

政府與資訊科技業界構建的物資捐獻網上平台繼續運作，團體及市民可於平台登記可捐贈的物資。政府至今共收到超過1 800個登記，其中約三成由機構提出，而餘下的由市民個人提出。已登記可捐獻物品種類涵蓋食品及飲品、衣物、日常生活用品、寢具、電器等多個類別。政府正透過相關政策局、政府部門和服務團體掌握居民的實際需要後進行物資配對工作，以便陸續把適用物資派送往有需要的地點。至今已有約19 600件涵蓋不同類別的物資配送至多個地點。物資配對和分發工作會持續進行。

規管巡查
————

房屋署今日繼續於宏昌閣、宏泰閣及宏新閣移除已被燒毀的外牆棚架。因現場環境狹窄及個別受災樓宇的竹棚和棚網損毀較嚴重，基於安全考慮，房屋署與警方會再評估其餘四座受火災影響大廈拆棚工作的時間表。另外，房屋局獨立審查組今日亦已完成抽取宏福苑全部七座受災樓宇的混凝土芯程序。

發展局十二月十一日公布外牆棚網就地抽樣檢查新制度，屋宇署將於下星期約見業界團體，以擬備向註冊承建商發出新的作業備考。發展局正全力準備相關配套，以預備足夠指定實驗所，以及合適用地作場外採樣工作。"
Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-13 21:08,2025-12-13 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/13/P2025121300778.htm,"  The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

 For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3.4 billion as of noon today (December 13). With the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.7 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

 As of this morning, a total of 1 392 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 3 163 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS).

 In consideration of the extremely urgent situation of the residents affected by the fire incident, a special arrangement of a full rent exemption has been made earlier by the Housing Bureau to provide accommodation support to those affected residents moving into transitional housing or HKHS projects. In other words, if needed, the affected residents can stay for a longer period of time. The Government will continue to support the affected residents in terms of accommodation, and the residents in need do not have to worry about the relevant rental expenses or the duration of stay.

 In addition, staff from the operating organisations of transitional housing and HKHS, as well as volunteers have been working around the clock to furnish the units with essential supplies. Taking Eminence Tower in Hung Shui Kiu as an example, each unit is equipped, upon move-in, with furniture and appliances such as bed frames, mattresses, pillows, cooking stoves and water heaters. Daily necessities including toilet paper, slippers and basic cleaning supplies, etc. are also provided. Such efforts are intended to help the affected residents settle in as quickly as possible.

 At the same time, a number of organisations have proactively stationed their staff in some projects to provide residents in need with various forms of support, including free medical and legal consultation services. The Government has also set up service stations in 18 projects where more residents have moved in, providing consultation and support services for residents in need, standing together with them.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

 The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 800 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, about 19 600 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Regulation and inspection work
----------------------------------

 The Housing Department today continued to remove the burnt scaffolding on the external walls of Wang Cheong House, Wang Tai House and Wang Sun House. As the environment at scene is narrow and the scaffolding and the protective nets of individual buildings may be subject to more serious damage, for the sake of safety, the Housing Department will conduct assessments with the Police on the timetable of removing the scaffolding of the remaining four affected buildings. In addition, the Independent Checking Unit of the Housing Bureau has also completed the extraction of concrete core samples from the seven affected buildings at Wang Fuk Court today.

 The Development Bureau (DEVB) announced on December 11 a new mechanism for sampling and testing scaffold nets for external walls in Hong Kong. The Buildings Department is preparing for the issuance of a new practice note to registered contractors and will meet with the industry next week. The DEVB is moving ahead in full steam the supporting arrangements to ensure that there are sufficient designated laboratories and a suitable site for off-site sampling work."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-13 17:30,2025-12-13 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/13/P2025121300482.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 13), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 79 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. As the CHP and the relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, the CHP continues to appeal to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373). All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.


Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
Official launch of Hong Kong Professional Services GoGlobal Platform marks new stage in supporting Mainland enterprises going global (with photos),2025-12-13 17:25,2025-12-13 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/13/P2025121300409.htm,"The Hong Kong Professional Services GoGlobal Platform, initiated by the Department of Justice (DoJ) with support of the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB), was officially launched today (December 13), marking a new stage of collaborative support by Hong Kong's professional services for Mainland enterprises going global.

The Platform was established under the steer of the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, to implement the initiative set out in the Policy Address. It is clearly stated in the Policy Address that Hong Kong should strengthen its role as a platform for enterprises going global, in which the Deputy Secretary for Justice is tasked to promote Hong Kong's legal services and to collaborate with other professional service sectors, such as accounting and finance, to support Mainland enterprises wishing to expand overseas.

The ceremony were attended by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau; the Director-General of Investment Promotion, Ms Alpha Lau; Deputy Executive Director of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council Mr Patrick Lau; representatives from local and overseas chambers of commerce, and professionals from the legal, financial and accounting sectors.

In his opening remarks at the launch ceremony, Dr Cheung stated that successful overseas expansion is often underpinned by high-quality professional services in fields such as law, finance, and accountancy. Renowned for their international outlook, uncompromising professional standards, and nuanced understanding of both Chinese and global contexts, Hong Kong's professional services sectors can provide Mainland enterprises with comprehensive support. Since the establishment of the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global (GoGlobal Task Force), many Mainland enterprises have expressed a strong desire to use Hong Kong as a ""launchpad"" for global expansion.

Dr Cheung continued that to provide effective support for Mainland enterprises going global, professional services must have both breadth and depth. That is an extensive pool of specialised and precise professional services providers tailored to the industry types and target markets of enterprises venturing overseas, with diverse choices of professional services providers suitable for businesses of all sizes. As such, the Platform is established to achieve two main objectives:

(1) To collaborate with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council in building a deeper and broader cross-professional services platform, enabling enterprises to enjoy a customised, bespoke experience. The Platform will provide useful references to Mainland enterprises by co-ordinating and integrating information related to Hong Kong's professional services, including their success stories in supporting Mainland enterprises expanding overseas. The Platform will also consolidate and publish lists of relevant professional services providers supporting overseas expansion, facilitating precise connections between Mainland enterprises and Hong Kong's professional servicesï¼

(2) To enhance the understanding of and to co-ordinate Hong Kong's professional services to efficiently meet the specific needs of Mainland enterprises expanding overseas. A few days ago, Dr Cheung led a delegation of over 40 representatives from cross-professional sectors to exchange views with representatives from around 70 enterprises and industry associations in Qianhai, Shenzhen. Satisfactory results were achieved.

To support and promote the work of the Platform, the DoJ will establish the Expert Committee on Professional Services for Going Global, consisting of Mainland and Hong Kong experts from the legal, financial, accounting as well as business sectors to provide professional strategic advice.

Dr Cheung also noted that connecting and matching Mainland enterprises with Hong Kong's professional services is a common goal of the GoGlobal Task Force and the Platform. The Platform will serve as a hub that brings together Hong Kong's cross-sector professional services as the main force to support enterprises going global. It will promote and support the professional services sectors, empowering them to better respond to the needs for professional services of Mainland enterprises. Meanwhile, the GoGlobal Task Force of the CEDB will directly engage with Mainland enterprises, serving as the pivotal point of contact for Mainland enterprises using Hong Kong as a ""launchpad"" to go global. The Task Force and the Platform are closely interlinked and complement each other.

Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Yau said that as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" connecting the Chinese Mainland and the world, Hong Kong possesses unique advantages. The city can assist Mainland enterprises in expanding their businesses overseas and addressing various challenges and difficulties they may encounter when going global, such as cross-border capital management, risk management, laws and regulations, cultural differences and talent recruitment. With its world-class and highly internationalised professional services, particularly the excellent legal services, Hong Kong is the best partner for Mainland enterprises going global.

Mr Yau noted that the steering committee for the GoGlobal Task Force is finalising the task force's overall direction, including identifying target enterprises, organising various promotional activities in the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong, and establishing a cross-sector service platform by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. The Platform will bring together Hong Kong professional services providers from different sectors to facilitate suitable matching with Mainland enterprises based on their needs.

He added that the Government will also leverage this service platform to bring more business opportunities for Hong Kong's professional services providers, with a view to further enhancing the influence of Hong Kong's professional services in the Chinese Mainland and overseas, and injecting momentum into Hong Kong's economic development.

At the launch ceremony, Dr Cheung released the inaugural edition of the ""Collection of Success Stories: Hong Kong's Professional Services Supporting Chinese Mainland Enterprises Going Global"" (bilingual in Chinese and English), which includes over 50 success stories spanning various professional domains, including legal, finance, accounting, and dispute resolution, covering different industries and investment locations such as the emerging markets of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Middle East and Africa. The publication has been uploaded to the DoJ's website.

Meanwhile, three experts from the legal, financial, and accounting sectors shared their practical experiences on how they successfully assisted enterprises in expanding overseas markets.

During the launch ceremony, a DoJ's promotional video was also presented, in which Dr Cheung, together with the President of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Mr Stephen Law, and the Head of Global Issuer Services of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, Mr Johnson Chui, jointly promote the advantages of Hong Kong's professional services in supporting Mainland enterprises to go global, emphasising Hong Kong's dual function as a ""super connector"" and ""value-adder"" in materialising the mission of ""Go Global, Choose Hong Kong"". The promotional video will be uploaded to various social media platforms."

A male passenger, aged 43, arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds concealed inside vacuum-sealed bags in his carry-on suitcase. He was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The cases will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on December 15.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

被捕人士已被控一項販運危險藥物罪，案件將於十二月十五日在西九龍裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。

海關會繼續根據風險管理的原則，重點揀選來自高風險地區的旅客作清關檢查，確保有效打擊跨境販毒活動。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。

香港專業服務出海平台正式啟動　支援內企出海新階段（附圖）,2025-12-13 16:08,2025-12-13 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/13/P2025121300408.htm,"由律政司推動發起、商務及經濟發展局（商經局）支持的「香港專業服務出海平台」今日（十二月十三日）正式啟動，標誌香港專業服務協同支援內地企業出海邁向新階段。

平台由律政司副司長張國鈞博士督導設立，以落實《施政報告》措施。《施政報告》明確提出，要強化香港作為企業出海平台的優勢，並指明由律政司副司長專責推廣香港法律服務，協同其他專業如會計、金融等，支援內企出海需要。

出席啟動禮包括商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺、投資推廣署署長劉凱旋、香港貿易發展局副總裁劉會平、本地及海外商會、法律、金融、會計等不同專業界別的代表。

張國鈞博士於啟動禮致開幕辭時表示，企業要成功出海，必須要有法律、金融和會計等高水平專業服務的支援。香港專業服務具備國際視野、達到國際標準的專業能力，而且對中外文化有深入了解，能為內地企業提供全方位專業支援。不少內企在商經局成立「內地企業出海專班」後，均表達強烈「借港出海」的意願。

他續說，要為出海企業提供到位支援，專業服務必須具廣度和深度，即專業服務隊伍既要龐大，又要專門而精準，能針對企業出海的行業類型和出海目的地，亦需要有適合不同規模企業的專業服務提供者供選擇。為此，「專業服務平台」成立有兩大目的：

（一）與香港貿易發展局共同構建一個更廣更深的跨界別專業服務平台，讓企業獲得客制化體驗。「專業服務平台」會整合香港專業服務的資訊，包括支援內企出海成功案例，供內企參考，並發布相關專業界別支援「出海」的名單，便利內企與香港專業服務精準對接；

（二）加強業界了解內企出海對專業服務的具體需求，協調香港專業服務為企業提供高效支援。數日前，張國鈞博士剛率領逾40位跨專業界別代表到深圳前海，與約70間內企和行業協會的代表交流，效果令人滿意。

為支援及推廣「專業服務出海平台」工作，律政司亦將成立「出海專業服務專家委員會」，匯聚內地與香港的法律、金融、會計專家以及商界代表，提供策略意見。

張國鈞博士亦提到，做好將內地企業與香港專業服務的聯繫和對接，是「出海專班」和「專業服務出海平台」的共同目標。「專業服務出海平台」是滙聚香港跨專業服務出海主力軍的樞紐，負責推廣和支援專業服務界別，從而更好地回應內企對專業服務的需求；而商經局的「出海專班」則是內企利用香港作為出海門戶的關鍵節點，會直接面向內企。兩者會相互緊扣，互聯互通。

丘應樺致辭時表示，作為內聯外通的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」，香港擁有得天獨厚的優勢。香港可以協助內地企業發展海外業務，應對在出海的過程中可能會遇到各種挑戰和難題，例如跨境資金管理、風險管理、法律法規、文化差異、人才招聘等。香港的專業服務具世界級水平，且高度國際化，是內地企業「出海」的最佳拍檔，特別在法律服務更是成就卓越。

丘應樺指出，出海專班督導委員會正敲定專班的工作方向，包括訂定目標企業、在內地及香港舉辦不同類型的推廣活動，以及由香港貿易發展局建立一個跨界別服務平台，匯聚香港不同界別的專業服務提供者，以便按不同內地企業的需要進行合適配對。

他補充，政府亦會用好這個服務平台為香港的專業服務提供者帶來更多商機，進一步提升香港專業服務在海內外的影響力，並為香港經濟發展注入動力。

啟動禮上，張國鈞博士公布《香港專業服務助力中國內地企業出海成功案例實錄》（中英雙語）首發版，收錄了超過50個成功「出海」案例，涉及法律、金融、會計、爭議解決不同專業領域，並涵蓋不同產業及投資地點，包括東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）、中東以及非洲等新興市場。《實錄》已上載律政司網頁。

同時，三位分別來自法律、金融、會計界別的專家，分享他們如何成功協助企業拓展海外市場的實踐經驗。

啟動禮亦播放律政司宣傳短片，由張國鈞博士聯同香港會計師公會主席羅卓堅，香港交易及結算所有限公司環球上市服務部主管徐經緯，共同推廣香港專業服務支援內企出海的優勢，強調香港作為「超級聯絡人」、「超級增值人」的雙重功能，共同實現「成功出海，首選香港」。有關宣傳短片將會上載多個不同社交媒體。"

張國鈞副司長（律政司副司長張國鈞博士）、各位來賓、各位朋友：

大家好。我很榮幸出席今日的活動，與各位見面和交流。

國家正實施高水平雙向對外開放戰略，鼓勵內地企業「出海」發展，內地企業「出海」的勢頭正在加速。香港有能力、亦有責任參與其中。

香港是全球最自由經濟體、第三大的金融中心、外來直接投資流入金額全球第三，是國際金融、航運、貿易中心，擁有領先全球的專業服務，匯聚全球資金與優秀人才。作為內聯外通的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」，香港有得天獨厚的優勢。

香港可以幫助內地企業發展海外業務，應對在「出海」的過程中可能會遇到各種挑戰和難題，例如跨境資金管理、風險管理、法律法規、文化差異、人才招聘等。香港的專業服務具世界級水平，且高度國際化，是內地企業「出海」的最佳拍檔，特別在法律服務更是成就卓越，今年在香港設立的國際調解院總部，充分顯示國際社會對香港法律專業的高度認同。其他專業服務例如金融、會計、知識產權、保險等亦各具實力，在國際上亦具有深厚知名度和影響力。

為推進「出海」方面的工作，我已按《行政長官2025年施政報告》的方針，在今年十月成立由我督導的跨局、跨部門、跨界別的內地企業出海專班。除了商經局旗下的各駐海外經濟貿易辦事處、投資推廣署和香港貿易發展局（貿發局）、它們在海內外的各個辦事處、香港出口信用保險局等，成員亦包括律政司、政制及內地事務局和各個駐內地辦事處、財經事務及庫務局、創新科技及工業局、香港金融管理局、香港交易及結算所有限公司、香港生產力促進局，協力為「出海」企業制訂全面策略和多元支援服務。

出海專班已在十月舉行督導委員會會議，我們正敲定專班的工作方向，包括訂定目標企業、在內地及香港舉辦不同類型的推廣活動，以及由貿發局建立一個跨界別服務平台，匯聚香港不同界別的專業服務提供者，當中包括法律、會計、稅務、金融服務、市場推廣、檢測驗證、運輸物流、建築等，以便按不同內地企業的需要進行合適配對，提供助力它們落戶香港，以至因應「出海」發展業務的香港專業服務提供者。

同時，我們也會用好這個服務平台為香港的專業服務提供者帶來更多商機，進一步提升香港專業服務在海內外的影響力，並為香港經濟發展注入動力。在這方面，我感謝律政司副司長帶領律政司共同建構專業服務平台，並向內地企業推廣香港的專業服務。

出海專班的跨界別服務平台正在起步階段，任重而道遠，需要大家的踴躍支持和參與。因此，我希望在座不同的專業服務業界人士能與貿發局等專班成員攜手合作，加入這個服務平台。此外，在日後專班的推廣活動中，我們也希望能邀請大家現身說法，親身向內地企業介紹我們的優質國際專業服務，讓我們一起合力支援內地企業「出海」。

多謝各位。"

丘應樺局長（商務及經濟發展局局長）、各位嘉賓、各位法律、金融、會計專業界別的精英、各位商界領袖：

大家好。非常歡迎大家出席「香港專業服務出海平台」啟動禮。

大家都知道，行政長官在今年的《施政報告》的其中一個亮點，就是要發揮好香港「內聯外通」的優勢，協助更多企業利用香港平台出海，為香港創造更多商機和經濟價值，亦為國家作出「一國兩制」之下的獨特貢獻。

所以，商務及經濟發展局（商經局）早前已經成立了「內地企業出海專班」，統籌和協調政府政策局及相關機構的出海工作，包括整合投資推廣署、香港貿易發展局（貿發局）、駐海外及內地辦事處等部門和機構的功能，更好地協助內地企業出海。「出海專班」成立後，已經迅速引起內地企業重視和關注，很多企業更主動地與專班接觸，表達強烈的「借港出海」意願。

究竟有甚麼吸引內地企業選擇「借港出海」？他們看中的其中一個優點，就是香港的優質專業服務。

沒錯，各位企業家都非常清楚，企業要成功出海，就必須要有法律、金融和會計等高水平專業服務的支援。香港的專業服務具備國際視野、達到國際標準的專業能力，以及對中外文化的深入了解，能夠為內地企業提供全方位、全週期的專業支援。從項目融資、管治架構設置、跨境稅務安排、風險管理，到合規審查、知識產權授予或保護、跨境爭議解決，以致企業重組等不同領域，香港專業服務都能夠提供國際級的專業服務。香港專業服務的綜合實力，正是企業開拓「安全航道」，成功出海的重要保障。

因此，行政長官亦同時在今年的《施政報告》公布，由我領導推廣香港的法律專業服務，同金融、會計等其他專業界別，提升支援內地企業出海。律政司今日成立「香港專業服務出海平台」，就是要落實這項重要的任務。

要為出海企業提供到位的支援，便要按不同企業的需要進行合適配對。這涉及優質專業服務必須具備的兩個維度：即「廣度」和「深度」。

何謂「廣度」？「廣度」是指我們要有一支龐大的專業服務隊伍，可以讓企業放心自由選擇；而這支專業隊伍中更要有適合不同規模企業的專業服務提供者供企業選擇。

至於何謂「深度」？「深度」是指我們要針對企業出海的行業類型和出海目的地，製作一份專門而精準的專業服務提供者名單供企業參考選擇。

我們在過去幾年的調查研究和經驗中明白到，出海企業就像是走入裁縫店想做一套稱心滿意西裝的一位紳士，一套off-the-rack（現成的）的西裝是不能滿足客戶的需求。這位紳士需要的，是一套bespoke（全定製）西裝。而我們需要做的，就要為顧客製作一套，不論是外形、材料、細節以及手工上，真正意義上的個人西裝。

目前，貿發局正建立一個跨界別專業服務平台，匯聚香港不同界別的專業服務提供者。律政司今日宣布成立「香港專業服務出海平台」，其中一個目的，就是與貿發局共同構建一個更深、更廣的專業服務平台，讓企業獲得客製化、bespoke的體驗。「香港專業服務出海平台」將會涵蓋兩大範疇。第一：統籌並整合有關香港法律、金融、會計等專業服務的資訊，包括收集這些專業界別支援內地企業出海的成功案例，並統整和發布相關專業界別支援出海的名單，讓內地企業和相關持份者參考，並更便利和更有信心地與香港專業服務建立聯繫和進行業務對接。

就出版成功案例方面，我們今日就踏出了重要的第一步。律政司在業界的大力支持下，在短時間內編撰了我手上這本《香港專業服務助力中國內地企業出海成功案例實錄》。這個首發版本收錄了超過50個成功出海案例，涉及法律、金融、會計、爭議解決等不同專業領域，更有企業「現身說法」；同時涵蓋不同產業，包括網約車平台、消費品、能源業務、礦業以及航運及運輸等；而投資地點更遍布全球不同國家和地區，包括東盟、中東以及非洲等新興市場。

未來，「香港專業服務出海平台」會持續與業界緊密聯繫，收集業界的實踐經驗，出版更多成功案例，為內地企業提供有益的參考。

「香港專業服務出海平台」的第二項功能，是加強了解內企出海對專業服務的具體需求，協調香港專業服務為企業提供高效的支援。舉個例子，我在本周三剛組織了逾40位跨專業界別代表，去到深圳前海與約70間內企和行業協會的代表交流。這次交流活動由律政司與深圳市前海管理局首次合辦，目的是加深內企對香港專業服務優勢的認識，促進內地企業首選香港作為出海的平台。內企和香港專業界別代表都對成果非常滿意，十分支持繼續舉辦這種交流活動。

此外，律政司也會成立「出海專業服務專家委員會」，委員會匯聚內地及香港的法律、金融和會計界別的專家，以及優秀的商界和企業代表，就推廣香港專業服務以支援內地出海的策略，向律政司提供意見，支援和推廣「平台」的工作。好幾位「專家委員會」的成員今日也特別抽空出席支持，特此感謝。

大家都會非常關心，律政司的平台與商經局的「出海專班」如何分工，如何對接？

我趁今日的機會，向大家說明一下。出海企業面對的是浩瀚無邊的汪洋大海。特區政府團隊的成員必須在不同環節各司其職，並相互配合，方能為企業開拓「安全航道」，達到「保駕護航」的目標。商經局的「出海專班」會直接面向內地企業，可以說是內地企業利用香港作為出海門戶的關鍵節點。而律政司的「香港專業服務出海平台」，將會匯聚香港的專業服務，推廣和支援專業服務界別，更高效地回應內地出海對專業服務的需求。

如何將內地企業與香港的專業服務有效聯繫和對接，是「出海專班」和「專業服務平台」的共同目標和功能，兩者相互緊扣，互聯互通。就此，「出海專班」會加入律政司的代表，而貿發局代表也是律政司專家委員會的成員之一。商經局丘局長，稍後也會為大家介紹就支援內地企業出海的重點工作。

總括而言，律政司和商經局會緊密聯繫，雙互協調和配合。我們目標一致，就是推廣和發揮香港作為內地企業出海首選平台的獨特角色，以及香港作為「超級聯絡人」、「超級增值人」的雙重功能，共同實現「成功出海，首選香港」。

謝謝。"

「香港專業服務出海平台」的第二項功能，是加強了解內企出海對專業服務的具體需求，協調香港專業服務為企業提供高效的支援。舉個例子，我在本周三剛組織了逾40位跨專業界別代表，去到深圳前海與約70間內企和行業協會的代表交流。這次交流活動由律政司與深圳市前海管理局首次合辦，目的是加深內企對香港專業服務優勢的認識，促進內地企業首選香港作為出海的平台。內企和香港專業界別代表都對成果非常滿意，十分支持繼續舉辦這種交流活動。

此外，律政司也會成立「出海專業服務專家委員會」，委員會匯聚內地及香港的法律、金融和會計界別的專家，以及優秀的商界和企業代表，就推廣香港專業服務以支援內地出海的策略，向律政司提供意見，支援和推廣「平台」的工作。好幾位「專家委員會」的成員今日也特別抽空出席支持，特此感謝。

大家都會非常關心，律政司的平台與商經局的「出海專班」如何分工，如何對接？

我趁今日的機會，向大家說明一下。出海企業面對的是浩瀚無邊的汪洋大海。特區政府團隊的成員必須在不同環節各司其職，並相互配合，方能為企業開拓「安全航道」，達到「保駕護航」的目標。商經局的「出海專班」會直接面向內地企業，可以說是內地企業利用香港作為出海門戶的關鍵節點。而律政司的「香港專業服務出海平台」，將會匯聚香港的專業服務，推廣和支援專業服務界別，更高效地回應內地出海對專業服務的需求。

如何將內地企業與香港的專業服務有效聯繫和對接，是「出海專班」和「專業服務平台」的共同目標和功能，兩者相互緊扣，互聯互通。就此，「出海專班」會加入律政司的代表，而貿發局代表也是律政司專家委員會的成員之一。商經局丘局長，稍後也會為大家介紹就支援內地企業出海的重點工作。

總括而言，律政司和商經局會緊密聯繫，雙互協調和配合。我們目標一致，就是推廣和發揮香港作為內地企業出海首選平台的獨特角色，以及香港作為「超級聯絡人」、「超級增值人」的雙重功能，共同實現「成功出海，首選香港」。

謝謝。"

​行政長官在2025粵港澳院士峰會．全國重點實驗室技術成果大灣區對接大會致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-12-13 11:00,2025-12-13 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/13/P2025121200327.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十二月十三日）在2025粵港澳院士峰會．全國重點實驗室技術成果大灣區對接大會的視像致辭：

各位院士專家、各位全國重點實驗室的代表、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

我恭賀2025粵港澳院士峰會暨全國重點實驗室技術成果大灣區對接大會順利召開。

二十屆四中全會審議通過《中共中央關於制定國民經濟和社會發展第十五個五年規劃的建議》。建議提出發揮香港背靠祖國、聯通世界獨特優勢和重要作用，支持香港建設國際創新科技中心和打造國際高端人才集聚高地。

特區政府全力建設香港成為國際創新科技中心。香港是全球唯一擁有五所百強大學的城市，匯聚海內外科研人才，與大灣區內地城市優勢互補。在最新公布的《全球創新指數》中，「深圳－香港－廣州」集群首次排名全球第一，充分證明大灣區在全球創科領域的領先地位，以及對大灣區成果轉化、科研水平和發展潛力的肯定。

創新驅動發展，科技引領變革。特區政府已在二○二二年公布《香港創新科技發展藍圖》，為特區訂立五到十年的發展目標。三年以來，《藍圖》的各項政策措施全速推進，我們加強了「政、產、學、研、投」的高效協作，積極發展新質生產力和推動新型工業化，促進科技創新和產業創新融合發展，推動經濟高質量發展。

肩負國家重托，發揮香港優勢。在國家的支持下，15所香港的實驗室獲批准成為全國重點實驗室，已經在今年七月開始運作。在香港的全國重點實驗室會緊密對接國家的重大戰略需求，同時發揮好香港在「一國兩制」下內聯外通的優勢，積極拓展全球科研合作，為國家高水平科技自立自強和建設香港國際創科中心作出貢獻。

凝聚灣區動力，築牢創科根基。河套深港科技創新合作區是國家「十四五」規劃下的大灣區重大合作平台。河套香港園區即將正式開園，同時我們正全面規劃北部都會區內的新田科技城和沙嶺創科用地。這些創科用地將為香港創造更有利的條件，集聚國際創科資源和人才，為香港建設國際創科中心和培育新質生產力提供重要支撐。

今年是國家「十四五」規劃的收官之年，也是「十五五」規劃的謀篇布局之年。展望未來，香港會繼續發揮好自身優勢，擔當好「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的重要角色，更積極融入和服務國家發展大局。

本次峰會的主題是「全重匯灣區產創深融合」。峰會匯聚了多位院士、全國重點實驗室的專家和企業代表，共同為推動科技創新與產業創新深度融合交流互鑑。我期待廣東院士聯合會與在座各位繼續與香港攜手合作，為國家的高質量發展和強國建設貢獻更大力量。

最後，我祝願今天的峰會成果豐碩，各位工作順利。謝謝大家。"
