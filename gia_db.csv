香港海關加強打擊社交平台無牌金錢服務,2026-01-13 16:55,2026-01-13 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/13/P2026011200602.htm,"近年，香港海關留意到利用社交平台提供無牌金錢服務的個案呈上升趨勢。為有效打擊此類非法活動，海關加強網上巡查及執法，並於去年共偵破二十三宗無牌經營金錢服務案件，拘捕二十四人。其中二十二宗案件與利用社交平台有關。

此外，海關於調查無牌經營金錢服務案件期間，發現四宗案件的涉案銀行戶口有頻繁及大量來歷不明的交易紀錄。經深入調查後，海關拘捕四名銀行戶口持有人，懷疑他們透過提供無牌金錢服務進行洗錢活動。當中一名銀行戶口持有人早前已被控兩項「處理已知道或相信為代表從可公訴罪行的得益的財產」（俗稱洗黑錢），被法庭判處罪名成立和監禁五十四個月。

海關會繼續加強執法，打擊無牌經營金錢服務。海關提醒消費者應光顧持牌的金錢服務經營者，持牌人登記名冊可於海關的金錢服務經營者牌照系統網頁瀏覽：eservices.customs.gov.hk/MSOS/wsrh/001s1?request_locale=zh_TW。

根據《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》，任何人士如知道或有合理理由相信任何財產，不論全部或部分、直接或間接，代表任何人從可公訴罪行的得益，而仍然處理該財產，即屬犯罪。一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及監禁十四年，而相關犯罪得益亦可被沒收。

根據《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》，任何人士欲經營匯款或貨幣兌換服務，例如經營涉及外幣兌換的電子錢包充值服務，必須先向海關領取牌照，否則該無牌經營者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

Hong Kong Customs strengthens enforcement against unlicensed money services on social media platforms,2026-01-13 16:55,2026-01-13 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/13/P2026011200597.htm,"In recent years, Hong Kong Customs has noted an increasing trend in cases involving unlicensed money services provided through social media platforms. To effectively combat such illegal activities, Customs has intensified online patrols and enforcement efforts, and detected 23 cases of unlicensed money service operations and arrested 24 individuals in 2025, of which 22 cases involved the use of social media platforms.

During the investigation of the unlicensed money service operations, Customs discovered that in four cases, the bank accounts involved had frequent and substantial transactions of unknown sources. Upon detailed investigations, Customs arrested four bank account holders suspected of using unlicensed money services to launder money. One of the bank account holders had earlier been charged with two counts of ""dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" (commonly known as money laundering), and was convicted and sentenced to 54 months of imprisonment by the court.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement to crack down on unlicensed money service operations. Customs reminds consumers to procure services from licensed money service operators. A register of licensees is accessible from the website of Customs' Money Service Operators Licensing System at eservices.customs.gov.hk/MSOS/wsrh/001s1?request_locale=en.

Under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, a person commits an offence if he or she deals with any property knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that such property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and imprisonment for 14 years while the crime proceeds are also subject to confiscation.

Under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, a person who wishes to operate a remittance or money changing service such as operating an electronic wallet top‑up service involving currency exchange needs to first obtain a licence from the Customs and Excise Department. The maximum penalty for such operators without a valid licence upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected unlicensed money service operation to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)."
二零二五年十二月份中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查結果,2026-01-13 16:30,2026-01-13 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/13/P2026011300280.htm,"政府統計處今日（一月十三日）發表二零二五年十二月份中小型企業（中小企）業務狀況按月統計調查的結果。

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年十一月在收縮區域的44.5上升至二零二五年十二月的44.9，而未來一個月（即二零二六年一月）的業務收益展望動向指數為47.3。按行業分析，一些統計調查涵蓋的行業的業務收益現時動向指數在二零二五年十二月較上月上升，特別是地產業（從47.1上升至49.3）及進出口貿易業（從44.7上升至46.4）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數從二零二五年十一月的46.0上升至二零二五年十二月的47.7，而未來一個月（即二零二六年一月）的新訂單展望動向指數為48.4。

評論

政府發言人表示，二零二五年十二月中小企的營商氣氛大致繼續恢復。業務收益的現時動向指數在十二月有所上升，而展望未來一個月情況的指數也保持在相對高位。同時，整體就業情況亦顯示進一步改善。

展望未來，香港經濟保持良好的勢頭應為本地營商氣氛帶來支持。政府會密切監察外圍環境的各種不確定因素。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指從業人數少於50人的公司。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於規模較大的公司的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己公司情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for December 2025,2026-01-13 16:30,2026-01-13 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/13/P2026011300287.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (January 13) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for December 2025.

  The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs increased from 44.5 in November 2025 in the contractionary zone to 44.9 in December 2025, whereas the one-month's ahead (i.e. January 2026) outlook DI on business receipts was 47.3. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts for some surveyed sectors rose in December 2025 as compared with previous month, particularly for the real estate (from 47.1 to 49.3) and import and export trades (from 44.7 to 46.4).

  The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades increased from 46.0 in November 2025 to 47.7 in December 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month's time (i.e. January 2026) was 48.4.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business sentiment among SMEs in December 2025 broadly continued to recover. The current diffusion index on business receipts increased somewhat in December, and the index on outlook in one month's time stayed at a relatively high level. Meanwhile, the overall employment situation also indicated further improvement.

  Looking ahead, local business sentiment should continue to be underpinned by the continued positive momentum of the Hong Kong economy. The Government will closely monitor the uncertainties in the external environment.

Further information

  The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to companies with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent companies in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

  The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own companies rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300).

"CE officiates at ""Flagship in Motion · Connecting the World"" Launch Ceremony of Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong and Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute (with photos/video)",2026-01-13 16:30,2026-01-13 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/13/P2026011300497.htm,"The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong (CMHHK) and the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute (GCMTI) held the ""Flagship in Motion · Connecting the World"" Launch Ceremony today (January 13). The ceremony was officiated by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee. A number of national officials, as well as over 300 guests, including representatives from the local Chinese and Western medicine sectors and Members of the Legislative Council, attended to jointly witness Hong Kong entering a new stage in the development of Chinese medicine (CM).

The Minister of the National Health Commission, Mr Lei Haichao; the Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Zhou Ji; the Commissioner of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ms Yu Yanhong; the Director General of the Fifth Bureau of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Zhao Xudong; and the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, joined the Chief Executive in hosting the plaque-unveiling ceremony.

Delivering his speech, Mr Lee said, ""The official launch of CMHHK and the GCMTI initiates the building of a CM ecosystem in Hong Kong connecting academic institutions with hospitals and linking scientific research to industry. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government is actively aligning with national strategies by fully integrating into and serving the overall national development of CM. The HKSAR Government is committed to promoting the high-quality development of CM, fully leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages of enjoying the strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world under the 'one country, two systems' principle to establish Hong Kong as a bridgehead for CM to go global. I hope that the CM sector in Hong Kong will innovate from inheritance and develop through innovations, with a view to making greater contributions to the health of all mankind.""

Mr Lei said, ""The National Health Commission and the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine are fully promoting the role of CM in prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and innovation, talent training and more. They are also promoting the establishment of integrated centres emphasising both Chinese and Western medicine at National Medical Centers and Regional Medical Centers, strengthening the talent pool of 'Western doctors learning CM', deepening clinical collaboration between Chinese and Western medicine for major and complex diseases, and improving the service system integrating Chinese and Western medicine.""

Professor Lo said, ""The commencement of services of the two flagship institutions for CM development in phases last month is conducive to Hong Kong's further development in areas such as CM clinical services, talent training, and testing standards. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the National Health Commission and the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for their continuous strong support for CM development in Hong Kong, as well as the support from the Hong Kong CM sector and relevant stakeholders for the development of these two projects.""

The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong

Located at 1 Pak Shing Kok Road in Tseung Kwan O, CMHHK occupies a site of about 42 900 square metres. CMHHK adopts a public-private partnership model, with its construction fully funded by the Government. The Government commissioned Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) as the contractor to set up an operator in accordance with the service deed to manage, operate, and maintain the hospital. CMHHK commenced services in phases from December 11 last year, providing outpatient and day-patient services in the first year. Upon full operation, it will provide 400 beds, and the outpatient services are expected to serve about 400 000 attendances annually. The hospital will focus on developing six specialised CM services, namely Internal Medicine in CM, External Medicine in CM, Gynaecology in CM, Paediatrics in CM, Orthopaedics and Traumatology in CM, and Acupuncture and Moxibustion in CM, as well as 12 special disease programmes covering areas such as elderly degenerative diseases, infertility, and chronic skin diseases. There is keen public demand for the hospital's services. In the first month of operation, the booking rate for subsidised general outpatient services was 100 per cent, the booking rate for subsidised specialised outpatient services exceeded 90 per cent, and the booking rate for non-subsidised outpatient services was close to 70 per cent.

As the CM teaching hospital for three local universities with schools of Chinese medicine, namely HKBU, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the University of Hong Kong, CMHHK is dedicated to promoting CM teaching, training, and research innovation. In addition to providing comprehensive clinical training and advanced training opportunities for CM undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as in-service CM practitioners, the hospital's Clinical Trial and Research Centre will support clinical research and the development of proprietary Chinese medicines. It will give full play to its role as a ""change-driver"", working closely with the CM sector and stakeholders to promote CM to go global.

The Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute

Established by the Department of Health in March 2017, the GCMTI is dedicated to establishing internationally recognised reference standards and testing methods for Chinese medicines. It also actively promotes the popularisation of CM culture and continues to deepen exchanges and collaboration with Mainland and international organisations to strengthen the global influence and credibility of CM. The temporary facility of the GCMTI at the Hong Kong Science Park has completed numerous special projects, including various globally leading testing and identification technologies for Chinese medicines. Furthermore, the GCMTI attaches great importance to building a talent pool, gathering elite talent from multidisciplinary backgrounds to inject continuous momentum into leading the future development of Chinese medicines, and contributing to the standardisation and internationalisation of Chinese medicines.

The permanent building of the GCMTI commenced operation in phases last month. The building occupies a site of about 17 200 sq m and features various important facilities, including four specialties of advanced laboratories equipped with over 3 300 pieces of laboratory equipment and information technology equipment, the Chinese Medicines Herbarium and Laboratories, which is the first of its kind in Hong Kong to provide guided tour services, as well as an International Collaboration and Training Centre. These facilities will support the GCMTI in developing more novel testing methods for Chinese medicines and, through technology transfer and local and international co-operation and exchange, promote the high-quality advancement of CM to go global. The building also features an outdoor Shennong Herbal Garden of about 700 sq m. It is the first botanical garden in Hong Kong themed on Lingnan medicinal plants, showcasing about 180 species of medicinal plants."

Speech by SCST at ceremony to welcome Luminara's inaugural arrival in Hong Kong (English only) (with photo),2026-01-13 16:10,2026-01-13 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/13/P2026011300495.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the ceremony to welcome Luminara’s inaugural arrival in Hong Kong today (January 13):

Sebastian (Vice President and General Manager, Asia Pacific, The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection, Mr Sebastian Seward), Captain (Executive Director of the Hong Kong Pilots Association Limited, Captain Chin Kam Lam), Anthony (Executive Director of the Hong Kong Tourism Board, Mr Anthony Lau), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

I haven’t done this for a long time. I used to be in the Tourism Commission and I did a lot of inaugural ship visits. But this time, it feels very familiar although I am on board a new ship, seven months old, right? Because I see all the friends coming back. I make new friends who are extremely friendly and they feel so at home in Hong Kong. So, that's the ship because I have the office opposite of the harbour and this morning, I saw this ship, Luminara, and it was so amazing. It was so contemporary, you know that it is a nice ship just from looking on the outside of it. As Seb just said, sort of in place in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong is so in place with the ship. I thought this would be the beginning of a long and very happy partnership. Just now hearing what Seb has said, I think that really confirmed my gut reaction and intuition. So, it is with tremendous pleasure that I join you today at Ocean Terminal to welcome the inaugural arrival of Luminara to Hong Kong.

First and foremost, I would like to extend our warmest welcome to the Captain, your crew, and all distinguished guests aboard. To the Ritz-Carlton, thank you for choosing Hong Kong as a key destination of your newest and most exquisite vessel. I am particularly delighted to learn that Luminara is scheduled to make six turnaround calls in our city in 2026 and of course, I am sure we can entice you to do more next year.

The arrival of Luminara marks a significant milestone in Hong Kong's cruise tourism development. The debut of this ultra-luxury vessel in our harbour is a strong vote of confidence in Hong Kong's appeal as a world-class cruise hub. It also perfectly aligns with our strategy to attract high-value visitors and discerning travellers who seek not only a destination, but a premium and curated experience.

We have been working tirelessly to integrate our strengths in culture, sports, mega events and ecology with tourism to elevate every visitor's experience. For those with an eye for art, look no further than the Hong Kong Museum of Art right beside this vessel - a cultural landmark in itself, housing both classic and contemporary treasures. A stone's throw away, the West Kowloon Cultural District, also where the Ritz-Carlton is located, is home to the Hong Kong Palace Museum and the M+ museum. For the true art lovers, we offer insightful curator-led tours, private collection visits and exclusive behind-the-scenes experiences.

If you seek something more exhilarating, experience the thrill of our racecourses. Today, you may not be able to do that because we have races on Wednesdays and Sundays, but next time, plan your sailing in advance, our racecourses with themed parties and live music performances. Or join us, as I said before, join us at the state-of-the-art Kai Tak Sports Park, which hosts everything from signature events like the adrenaline-pumping Hong Kong Rugby Sevens. To concerts by global icons - know that BLACKPINK, for instance, will be here next weekend and you may just like to come visit us again.

For those in pursuit of serenity, our city's islands, bays and hidden gems offer tranquil escapes. Hong Kong is beautifully accessible by water - sailing by yacht or vessels along our stunning coastline is always an option. This is just a glimpse of what Hong Kong offers, and I am sure there is something here for everyone.

Ladies and gentlemen, we gather at a time of dynamic transformation of Hong Kong's tourism landscape. In 2025, we welcomed 49.9 million visitors worldwide, make it 50 million - a 12 per cent year-on-year increase. While we are grateful for this affection, we will not rest here. In the coming year, we will continue to enrich our offerings, host more exciting events, and collaborate with industry partners to curate diverse, immersive experiences. I am confident that each of you - especially our guests of Luminara - will find Hong Kong truly enchanting and unforgettable: a place that lingers in your heart and beckons you to come back.

I wish Luminara fair winds and following seas, and to everyone here, a prosperous and successful year ahead. I look forward to seeing this magnificent vessel grace our skyline many more times in the future, in this year and in the years to come.

Thank you very much."
Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2026-01-13 16:10,2026-01-13 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/13/P2026011300539.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on January 12 to noon today (January 13), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 104 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 196 506 samples of food imported from Japan (including 126 297 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 43 368 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

Hong Kong Customs conducts interdepartmental anti-illicit cigarette publicity activities in Tai Wai (with photos) ,2026-01-13 16:00,2026-01-13 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/13/P2026011300273.htm,"Hong Kong Customs today (January 13) conducted a joint anti-illicit cigarette publicity campaign with members of the Sha Tin District Council, the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the Department of Health, the Police and the Housing Department (HD) at Lung Hang Estate and Mei Lam Estate in Tai Wai and publicised the Duty Stamp System.

Customs officers patrolled the housing estates and distributed promotional items, as well as explained anti-illicit cigarette messages and the new penalties for offences related to illicit cigarettes to residents, including the penalty increase for offences of failing to declare to Customs officers compoundable under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) from $2,000 to $5,000 and the enhanced maximum penalty for relevant offences relating to duty-not-paid tobacco from a $1 million fine and two-year imprisonment to a $2 million fine and seven-year imprisonment.

Customs officers also introduced the Duty Stamp System to be implemented in Hong Kong to members of the District Council and residents. The three-month Pilot Run for the Duty Stamp System launched by Customs concluded on January 4. Customs will, upon concluding the experience gained in the Pilot Run and examining the feedback collected from various stakeholders, work with a technical consultant to optimise the design of the Duty Stamp System. Customs plans to implement the first phase of the Duty Stamp System in the fourth quarter of this year, with full implementation in the second quarter of 2027, thus achieving the ultimate goal of effectively distinguishing duty-paid cigarettes from duty-not-paid ones and combating ""cheap whites"".

Customs will continue to strengthen publicity and education to raise the public awareness of anti-illicit cigarettes. If public rental housing units are found to be involved in illicit cigarette crimes, Customs will notify the HD for follow-up action after the conclusion of court proceedings. Customs reminds members of the public, especially young people, not to buy or sell illicit cigarettes or distribute illicit cigarette leaflets to avoid creating a criminal record that could affect their future.

Under the DCO, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years. Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002).

In accordance with the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Cap. 371), no person shall distribute any smoking product advertisement (including any promotional leaflets). Any person who contravenes the regulation is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000. Members of the public may report any suspected activities of illicit cigarette leaflets distribution to TACO's hotline 2961 8823."

The case involved unauthorised building works (UBWs) with an area of about 45 square metres on the roof of a village house on a lot in D.D.130, Tuen Mun. Since the Lands Department would not issue a certificate of exemption for the UBWs and the UBWs were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failure to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (January 13), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay.

業主不遵從清拆令被判罰款逾六萬元,2026-01-13 11:05,2026-01-13 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/13/P2026011300191.htm,"​一名業主由於不遵從根據《建築物條例》（第123章）發出的清拆令，上周五（一月九日）在屯門裁判法院被定罪及判罰款合共66,040元，當中56,040元屬就罪行持續的日數所判的罰款。

有關個䅁涉及屯門丈量約份第130其中一個地段一幢村屋天台上一個面積約45平方米的僭建物。由於有關僭建物不會獲地政總署發出豁免證明書，而有關僭建物並無事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，屋宇署遂根據《建築物條例》第24（1）條向業主發出清拆令。該業主沒有履行清拆令，故遭屋宇署檢控。

屋宇署發言人今日（一月十三日）說：「僭建物可導致嚴重後果。業主必須盡快遵從清拆令。對於未有遵從清拆令的業主，屋宇署會繼續採取執法行動，包括提出檢控，以保障樓宇及公眾安全。」

根據《建築物條例》，任何人無合理辯解而沒有遵從清拆令是嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可處罰款200,000元及監禁一年，及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款最高20,000元。"

尊敬的國家衞健委（國家衞生健康委員會）雷海潮主任、尊敬的中聯辦（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室）周霽主任、尊敬的國家中醫藥管理局余艷紅局長、尊敬的港澳辦五局（中央港澳工作辦公室、國務院港澳事務辦公室五局）趙旭東局長、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

歡迎大家今日出席香港中醫醫院和政府中藥檢測中心舉行的「旗艦領航 · 聯通世界」啓程儀式，為香港中醫藥發展揭開新篇章。

國家重視中醫藥的傳承、創新與發展，「十五五」規劃建議明確支持推進中醫藥傳承創新、促進中西醫結合。香港特區政府積極配合國家戰略，全力融入和服務國家中醫藥發展大局。

中醫藥是香港醫療體系的重要組成部分，我們同時具備與國際接軌的醫療體制、規管制度、標準制訂和臨床研究等各方面的實力。特區政府會全力推動中醫藥高質量發展，並充分發揮香港在「一國兩制」下「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的獨特優勢，讓香港成為中醫藥走向世界的橋頭堡。

上月，我們舉辦了第七屆粵港澳大灣區中醫藥傳承創新發展大會，匯聚全球各地約800位中醫藥專家、學者、衞生官員和業界代表，共同探討如何借助大灣區的協同創新優勢，推動中醫藥走向世界，為全人類的健康貢獻力量。

我們也在上月公布了香港首份《中醫藥發展藍圖》，勾劃香港中醫藥發展願景：我們要傳承中醫藥智慧，背靠祖國的經驗和資源，利用中醫藥讓香港市民享有更優質、更全面的醫療服務，提升健康。香港中醫醫院和政府中藥檢測中心作為中醫藥發展的兩大旗艦機構，將會配合《藍圖》，帶動中醫藥服務、人才培訓、產業科研等不同領域的發展。

香港中醫醫院採用公私營協作模式，整合公營醫療系統和私營中醫藥界的優勢，提供優質的醫療健康服務，同時推動中醫藥現代化。中醫醫院以「分科做專、專病做強」的原則，挑選合適的病種發展中醫專病服務；並採用「純中醫」、「中醫為主」、「中西醫協作」三種服務模式，因應不同人士的需求及健康狀況，提供安全、便利、優質的醫療服務。

中醫醫院自十二月十一日投入服務以來，廣受市民歡迎。首批使用者對醫院的環境和專業服務給予的評價十分正面。醫院在第一個月內已經三度增加額外診症名額，積極回應市民對服務的殷切需求。

此外，中醫醫院亦會開展臨床科研和中成藥研發。作為香港三所大學的中醫藥教學醫院，中醫醫院會為本科生和註冊中醫師提供臨床實習和深造培訓，成為中醫藥人才培訓的重要基地。

在中醫醫院旁邊的政府中藥檢測中心，將重點發展中藥檢測技術及標準，利用先進科技，研發國際認可的參考標準和檢測方法，加強業界對中藥及相關產品的品質控制，推動產業高質量發展，保障市民健康和用藥安全。檢測中心亦會持續深化與海內外機構的交流合作，進一步加強中醫藥在全球的影響力和信任。

香港中醫醫院和政府中藥檢測中心正式啓程，為香港構建一個從院校到醫院、從科研到產業，環環相扣的中醫藥生態系統。幾千年來，中醫藥代代相傳、生生不息，我期望香港的中醫藥業界「傳承不泥古，創新不離宗」，在傳承中創新、在創新中發展，為全人類的健康作出更大貢獻。

最後，我祝願香港中醫藥事業欣欣向榮，在座各位身體健康。多謝大家。"

勞工處發言人說：「在得知意外發生後，本處已即時派員到意外現場展開調查。我們已向有關承建商發出『暫時停工通知書』，停止其在該地盤內使用流動式起重機進行吊運工作，直至我們信納有關承建商已採取措施消除有關危害，才可復工。」

發言人續說：「本處正全速進行調查，以確定意外成因，查找有關持責者的法律責任，以及提出改善措施。若調查發現有違例事項，定會依法處理。」

為防止工人在解除索具時被吊運物撞倒或夾倒，勞工處提醒僱主應（一）確保承托吊運物的地點需穩妥；以及（二）制定解除吊運物上吊具的正確方法，以防止吊運物在解除索具過程中移位。

根據《職業安全及健康條例》的一般責任條款規定，僱主必須為其僱員提供安全的工作環境、作業裝置及工作系統。違反有關規定，循公訴程序定罪，最高可被判罰款一千萬元及監禁兩年。

就今日的意外，勞工處會於日內透過其「職安健2.0」流動應用程式、網頁及電子郵件發放「職安警示」，通知持責者、工會和安全從業員專業組織等，簡介意外事故和提醒業界採取安全預防措施，以避免同類意外發生。

勞工處會敦促有關僱主必須履行《僱員補償條例》的補償責任，亦會協助死者家屬辦理工傷補償事宜，及密切跟進有關個案。對於有經濟困難的家庭，勞工處會協助他們申請合適的緊急援助基金。勞工處亦會因應家屬的需要及意願，就經濟或其他方面的援助聯絡社會福利署。

為了保障所有在工作中的僱員的安全及健康，勞工處呼籲僱主必須提供安全和不會危害健康的作業裝置及工作系統。僱員亦須與其僱主合作，遵守所有安全措施及適當使用所提供的個人防護裝備，避免危害自己及他人的工作安全。"
Labour Department highly concerned about fatal work accident that happened in Kai Tak today,2026-01-12 23:58,2026-01-13 00:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/12/P2026011200885.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) is highly concerned about a fatal work accident that happened at a construction site in Kai Tak this afternoon (January 12). While a male worker was detaching the lifting gear connected to the top of a water tank, the water tank displaced suddenly, trapping the worker between the water tank and a bored pile casing nearby. He was certified dead later in hospital. The LD is saddened by the death of the worker and expresses its deepest sympathy to his family.

 The LD's spokesman said, ""We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and have issued suspension notices to the contractors concerned, suspending the use of mobile cranes for lifting operation at site concerned. The contractors cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that suitable measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken.""

 The spokesman added, ""We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation.""

 To prevent workers from being struck or trapped by loads when engaged in unrigging process, the LD reminds employers to (i) ensure that the place supporting the loads is secure; and (ii) formulate proper unrigging methods for detaching lifting gear so as to prevent displacement of the objects in the course of unrigging operations.

 The general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance require employers to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

 In regard to today's accident, the LD will issue a Work Safety Alert through its mobile application ""OSH 2.0"", website and email, giving a brief account of the accident concerned to duty holders, workers' unions, professional bodies of safety practitioners and others, and reminding the industry of the importance of following safety precautionary measures to prevent a recurrence of similar accidents.

 The LD will also remind the employer concerned of the liability for employees' compensation under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, assist family members of the deceased to claim employees' compensation and closely follow up on the case. For those with financial difficulties, the LD will assist them to apply for appropriate emergency funds. Subject to the needs and wishes of family members of the deceased, the LD will also liaise with the Social Welfare Department for financial or other assistance.

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-12 17:30,2026-01-12 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/12/P2026011200575.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 12), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
------------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

林文健醫生說：「口腔健康是構成身體健康的重要一環。政府在二○二四年十二月公布口腔健康及牙科護理工作小組總結報告及行動計劃，採納『做闊做淺、做窄做深』的策略發展口腔健康及牙科護理服務體系。當中，『做窄做深』聚焦為較難獲得牙科服務的弱勢社群，包括有經濟困難人士、有殘疾或特殊需要人士及高風險群組，以公營或資助模式提供必需的牙科服務，包括預防性和治療性的口腔健康及牙科護理服務。行政長官於二○二五年《施政報告》亦提出強化公營及資助牙科服務，以加強於社區提供口腔健康教育、口腔衞生指導和風險評估等。我們目標是實踐重預防、早發現、早治療牙患，以保存牙齒，最終達致促進市民口腔健康和身體健康。」

他續說：「政府成立委員會旨在推動政府和業界的協同作用，精準界定特殊護理牙科服務的範圍，確保服務能針對性地滿足特定群組的需求。委員會亦會監測、評估及檢討現有的公營特殊護理牙科服務，包括識別目前服務模式的不足之處及難題，以制定長期策略以提升針對特定群組的牙科服務。此外，我們亦會就特殊護理牙科服務相關的人力資源規劃及牙科教育策略提供意見，並就如何將特殊護理牙科確立為香港正式認可的專科提供指引。」

根據衞生署最新口腔健康調查報告，65至74歲非居於院舍長者的無牙比率從二○一一年的5.6%顯著下跌至二○二一年的0.9%，同期，牙齒數目則由19.3顆上升至22.8顆。是次調查亦發現，65歲或以上使用長期護理服務的長者較二○一一年同一人口組別的人士擁有較多牙齒，完全沒有牙齒的比例也較少。不過，該組別人士中超過一半有未經治療的蛀牙，其牙齒和假牙的清潔情況亦令人關注。因此，提升其照顧者對日常口腔護理的重視同樣重要。由於大部分使用長期護理服務的長者都有較複雜的醫療狀況，所以需要調整他們接受的牙科治療。因此，加強牙科專業人員培訓以配合未來基層口腔健康護理和特殊護理牙科服務的發展至為重要。

林文健醫生感謝委員會各成員以不同專業範疇的知識和經驗就提升特定群組的口腔健康水平和生活質素提供寶貴意見，供政府參考。

委員會成員的任命由二○二五年十二月一日起生效至二○二七年十一月三十日，為期兩年。

DH's Special Care Dental Services Coordinating Committee holds first meeting (with photos),2026-01-12 17:11,2026-01-12 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/12/P2026011200243.htm,"The Special Care Dental Services Coordinating Committee (SCDSCC) under the Department of Health (DH) held its inaugural meeting today (January 12). The SCDSCC will advise the Government on the long-term strategic development of special care dental (SCD) services in Hong Kong, with the aim of further enhancing the oral health and quality of life of targeted population groups.

The newly established SCDSCC is co-chaired by the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, and a member of the Specialty Board in Community Dentistry of the College of Dental Surgeons of Hong Kong, Dr Frankie So. Non-official members include representatives from local universities, the dental profession, the healthcare sector, allied health professions and distinguished community members with extensive experience and profound knowledge in relevant fields (see Annex for the list of members).

The SCDSCC reviewed the strategies for public SCD services and the overall oral health condition of the Hong Kong population. Members also discussed how to better address the needs of targeted population groups.

""Oral health is an integral part of general health. In December 2024, the Government released the final report of the Working Group on Oral Health and Dental Care and the corresponding action plan, adopting the strategy to promote prevention-oriented primary oral healthcare among citizens across all age groups while providing essential dental care services for underprivileged groups in particular. It targets underprivileged groups who have difficulties in accessing dental care, namely those with financial difficulties, persons with disabilities or special needs and high-risk groups, to receive essential dental services (including preventive and curative oral health and dental care services) through the public system or subsidy programmes. The Chief Executive proposed to bolster public and subsidised dental services in the 2025 Policy Address to enhance oral health education, oral hygiene instructions, risk assessments, and more in the community. Our target is to implement the strategy that emphasises prevention, early identification, and timely intervention of dental diseases with the objective of retaining teeth, thereby achieving oral and general health of the public,"" said Dr Lam.

""The Government established the SCDSCC to promote synergy between the Government and the industry, precisely define the scope of SCD services and ensure that the services can meet the specific needs of the targeted groups. The SCDSCC will also monitor, evaluate and review existing public SCD services, including identifying the gaps and challenges in the current service model in order to formulate long-term strategies for enhancing SCD services for the specific groups. Additionally, we will advise on workforce planning and strategies for dental education with respect to SCD services and provide guidance on establishing Special Care Dentistry as a formally recognised specialty in Hong Kong,"" he added.

According to the latest Report of the Oral Health Survey by the DH, the proportion of non-institutionalised older persons aged 65 to 74 with no teeth significantly dropped from 5.6 per cent in 2011 to 0.9 per cent in 2021, while their number of ""teeth in mouth"" increased from 19.3 to 22.8 in parallel. This survey also found more remaining teeth in those aged 65 years or above who are long-term care (LTC) users, and a smaller proportion of them had complete tooth loss when compared to the same population groups in 2011. However, untreated decayed teeth were found in more than half of the LTC users, and the cleanliness of their teeth and prostheses was a concern. Therefore, the importance of daily oral care must also be promoted to their carers. The majority of LTC users required modifications in the provision of dental treatment due to their complex medical conditions. Enhanced training for dental professionals to support the future development of primary oral healthcare and SCD services is therefore crucial.

Dr Lam expressed gratitude to all SCDSCC members for contributing valuable insights from their diverse areas of expertise to improve the oral health and quality of life of specific groups, providing the Government with valuable information.

The appointments of the SCDSCC members are effective from December 1, 2025, to November 30, 2027, for a term of two years."
Nominations open for Anti-rodent Partner Awards 2026,2026-01-12 17:00,2026-01-12 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/12/P2026011200271.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) announced today (January 12) the launch of the Anti-rodent Partner Awards 2026, with nominations open from now until February 11.

To raise public awareness of environmental hygiene and encourage people to work together to cultivate good habits for a rodent-free environment, the FEHD launched the Anti-rodent Charter (the Charter) in December 2024. Property management companies, owners' corporations and residents' organisations of private residential premises were invited to participate and jointly create a rodent-free environment. To date, over 680 organisations and groups have signed the Charter, becoming Anti-rodent Partners of the FEHD.

The Anti-rodent Partner Awards 2026 aims to encourage residential premises to establish long-term anti-rodent mechanisms; enhance residents' attention to and engagement in environmental hygiene; and promote experience sharing and interaction among communities. The FEHD hopes that by commending proactive organisations and groups, more stakeholders will be motivated to engage in rodent prevention and control work; cultivate good habits of maintaining environmental hygiene; achieve the ultimate goal of ""rodent eradication for all, building a rodent-free community""; and create a healthier, safer and more liveable environment for the public.

All Anti-rodent Partners who have signed the Charter are eligible for nomination. Details of the activity and application methods have been uploaded to the Charter's website (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/anti_rodent_charter.html).

An online briefing session will be held on January 16 (Friday) to introduce the details of the activity to Anti-rodent Partners. Interested organisations or groups may register by emailing anti_rodentcharter@fehd.gov.hk.

  An FEHD spokesman emphasised that effective rodent prevention and control hinges on the co-operation of government departments, relevant sectors, stakeholders, as well as members of the public to bolster anti-rodent efforts in their respective areas. Members of the public should maintain good environmental hygiene and eliminate the three fundamental survival conditions of rodents, namely food, harbourage and passages, i.e. the elimination of the food sources and hiding places of rodents as well as blockage of their dispersal routes.

​The FEHD appeals to residential estates, property management companies and residents' organisations that have not yet signed the Charter to sign it and become Anti-rodent Partners, taking concrete actions to contribute to rodent prevention and control efforts, and jointly create a more liveable environment."

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2026-01-12 17:00,2026-01-12 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/12/P2026011200520.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (January 12) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From January 4 to 10, the CHP recorded two community-acquired LD cases. Both patients involved had underlying illnesses. The details of the cases are as follows:


a 70-year-old male patient living in Kwun Tong District; and
a 76-year-old male patient living in Tai Po District.


​The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that these are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these twocommunity-acquired cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

  As of January 10, two LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2025 and 2024, there were 167 and 135 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpool spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or ships.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpool spas, water fountains, humidifiers and home respiratory devices that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


The public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) or less and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2026-01-12 17:00,2026-01-12 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/12/P2026011200519.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月十二日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在一月四日至十日期間，中心錄得兩宗社區感染退伍軍人病個案，兩名病人均有長期病患，詳情如下：


70歲男病人，居於觀塘區；及
76歲男病人，居於大埔區。


​中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這兩宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至一月十日，今年錄得兩宗退伍軍人病案。本港於二○二五年及二○二四年分別錄得167及135宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池、加濕器和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


​市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米或以下，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及
避免在通風較差的環境工作，如密封的溫室。
