發展局局長在重慶出席2025年世界城市日中國主場活動全球城市可持續發展市長論壇致辭（只有中文）,2025-10-28 18:06,2025-10-28 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800587.htm,"以下是發展局局長甯漢豪今日（十月二十八日）在重慶出席2025年世界城市日中國主場活動全球城市可持續發展市長論壇的致辭全文：

尊敬的各位領導、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！我很高興來到重慶，出席今年世界城市日中國主場活動。今年的活動主題「人民城市智繪未來」，展示出中國城市發展的任務，是以人為本，建設創新、宜居、智慧、安全和包容的現代化城市。去年，我在美麗的臨海城市威海，與大家分享了香港建造新開發區的經驗。今年來到充滿魅力的山城重慶，我希望與大家分享香港城市裏面「舊」的部分。我會利用三個案例與各位分享我們把「舊」的部分現代化的進程中的三個「新」。

（一）新思維推動市區更新

第一個「新」，是新思維。跟許多已發展的城市一樣，香港老舊樓宇增長的速度遠比重建快。目前我們的私人樓宇年齡達到50年或以上的大概有一萬幢，佔所有私人樓宇總數的百分之二十，主要集中在人煙稠密的巿區地段。一直以來，特區政府透過法例及行政措施採取重建和復修雙軌並行的市區更新政策。在重建方面，我們透過一個由政府利用法例成立的市區重建局，由二○○一年到今天，開展了超過80個市區更新項目，當中包括重建、保育、活化和改造等。但是面對香港樓宇老化的問題，我們需要突破思維，打破限制。

首先，我們不再局限於在市區中心地帶的重建和原區調遷，而是利用我們正在着力推動的新發展區的土地來鼓勵推動香港老區的重建工作。我們現正在香港打造一個佔香港面積三分之一的新發展區，我們稱它為北部都會區。在裏面我們會預留部分住宅用地，讓市區重建局籌劃重建項目時，為受影響的業主提供替代單位，作為其中一個補償方案。當然，怎麼吸引習慣於老舊社區生活的老百姓到新的區域生活，為他們重塑一個他們熟悉的社區環境，是一個挑戰。我們期待向內地城市，以及世界的其他城市學習。

另一方面，我們要加大力度鼓勵市場上的企業進行併購及重建項目。老舊區域早年容許的容積率一般比較高，隨着時代進步，我們對宜居度也有提高要求。如果老舊樓宇要重建的話，在原址未必可以容許從前這麼高的容積率，所以我們最近提出為了吸引開發商進行重建工作，我們容許他們把原有的土地，在重建的時候還沒有盡用的容積率，可以轉移到其他地區使用。我們甚至提出加送百分之二十的容積率，也容許他們把這個加送的部分轉換成資金使用。

這些新措施打破了我們從前的政策思維與限制，更好推動我們的市場參與重建。

（二）新舊融合推動九龍東轉型

第二個「新」，是新舊融合推動城市轉型。舉個例子，香港九龍東地區本來是一個工業基地。隨着香港製造業的基地北移，這區域的功能大為不同，加上舊啟德機場的搬遷，為九龍東締造新發展的機遇。透過重新規劃、政策導引和社區營造，九龍東現在已經從傳統工業區蛻變成為優越的核心商業區。

區內的商業樓面面積在過去十多年翻了一翻，新的樓面面積主要來自私人市場的工業大廈活化及重建。作為第二個核心商業區，這裏的租金也比較相宜，為進駐香港的企業提供多元的選擇。我們也把握了轉型的機遇，為這個九龍東區域建設多項文化、藝術、體育及旅遊的項目，包括在今年三月開幕，現已成為香港另一個地標，吸引源源不絕的各項盛事活動的啟德體育園，以及很快就會正式啟用的東九文化中心。我們現在看到老百姓及訪客來到這個地區的時候，除了感受這個地區的「新」，他們也喜歡發掘這個地區裏面的「舊」，走進老街的歷史，品嚐老店的風味。

（三）香港新海濱發展

而第三個「新」，是為香港的海濱注入新的動力。我們美麗的維多利亞港是香港標誌性的資產。香港城市演變的過程中，聯繫着過去、現在與未來，這個港都一直在見證我們的變遷。濱海長廊的建設與變化是城市治理現代化的重要實踐，我們強調先駁通、後優化，讓老百姓可以早日享受使用維港兩岸的濱海。我們估計到二○二八年，維港兩旁的濱海長廊長度將延長至34公里。除了臨海的貨運碼頭、私人房產的部分，其他的維港濱海基本駁通。在這個過程中，我們強調依法依規。我們嚴格規管在維港推行大型的填海工程，同時我們為有利於市民享受海濱的小規模填海工程，比方碼頭、長廊，我們拆牆鬆綁。

第二方面，我們也重視與公眾的討論，達成共識。我們在部分濱海長廊採用開放式的公共空間管理模式，打造以人為本的海濱共享空間。我們突破傳統管理框架，設有共享徑的海濱，讓跑步、自行車、滑板、閒坐、寵物同樂等活動在同一個賽道各適其適，展現現代化治理中包容共融的價值追求。

最後，我希望以一段短視頻總結今天的分享，請大家觀看。

再次感謝大家，也感謝各位嘉賓。我在此祝願今天的研討會圓滿成功。謝謝大家！"
特區政府回應世界正義工程《2025年法治指數》,2025-10-28 17:55,2025-10-28 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800624.htm,"「世界正義工程」今日（十月二十八日）公布《2025年法治指數》，香港在東亞及太平洋地區繼續排名第六，並在全球143個國家和地區中位列24，整體分數（0.72）不變，與排名22和23的國家相同，大部分領域的得分只是輕微調整。香港的排名維持高位，並繼續領先於個別不時無理批評香港法治和人權狀況的歐美國家。

香港在「廉潔」和「秩序和安全」範疇的排名繼續保持全球十大以內，而且「廉潔」以及「監管執法」範疇的排名均較去年提升，分別排名全球第九位和第15位，反映香港持續是全球最廉潔的地區之一，其反貪工作成效廣受國際認同，而且擁有完善的監管執法機制。這亦引證在《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》和香港特別行政區（特區）其他維護國家安全的相關法律全面實施後，特區政府全力依法打擊危害國家安全的行為和活動，令社會回復秩序，經濟穩步發展，有效保持香港長期繁榮穩定。這些範疇的水平持續提升，有利於法治建設及營商環境，鞏固和提升香港的獨特優勢，讓香港充分發揮作為「內聯外通」的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色。

在「刑事司法」、「民事司法」和「對政府權力的制約」範疇方面，香港的排名幾乎不變。香港的司法制度一直受《基本法》保障，所有檢控決定基於所有可接納的證據和適用法律進行客觀分析後作出，不受任何干涉；香港與國際接軌及與時並進的法律框架，充分保障各方權利；司法機關依法獨立行使審判權，無論是面對刑事指控的人士或是民商事案件的當事人均會得到公平審訊。

香港在「開放政府」和「基本權利」範疇的得分和排名輕微下調，但香港在這些領域的東亞及太平洋地區排名維持不變。這些範疇的排名輕微下調看來並未能全面反映香港的實際情況，特區政府會持續透過不同渠道加強解說工作。事實上，香港擁有穩健的人權保障法律架構和開放的司法制度，特區政府堅定維護香港市民受法律保障的權利和自由。在《基本法》和《香港人權法案條例》下，市民能夠通過法律尋求公義，亦受穩固的法律援助制度保障。

香港在「一國兩制」下，是全球唯一的中英雙語普通法司法管轄區，法律制度公正完善，與國際高度接軌，具備大量國際經驗豐富的法律專業人才。香港的法治建設依然堅固穩定，其優良法治一直備受國際社會廣泛認同和尊重。特區政府會繼續堅決維護國家主權、安全和發展利益，全面準確貫徹「一國兩制」方針，持續推展法治教育，全方位維護香港特區的法治。特區政府也會通過不同渠道加強解說工作，包括吸引海外人士來港參與各項國際盛事，例如國際法律論壇等，讓外界親身體會和了解香港的實際情況。"

政務司司長出席十五運會和殘特奧會建築裝置設計比賽作品揭幕暨頒獎典禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-10-28 17:22,2025-10-28 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800595.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（十月二十八日）出席十五運會和殘特奧會建築裝置設計比賽作品揭幕暨頒獎典禮的致辭：

尊敬的黃嘉純副主席（香港賽馬會副主席）、劉文君會長（香港建築師學會會長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友、各位同事：

大家好，今天很高興出席十五運會（第十五屆全國運動會）和殘特奧會（全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會）建築裝置設計比賽作品揭幕暨頒獎典禮，與大家一起迎接這項全城矚目的體育盛事。

為慶祝及紀念十五運會和殘特奧會在香港舉行，全國運動會香港賽區統籌辦公室與香港建築師學會攜手合作，舉辦了這次比賽。透過比賽公開徵集兩組建築裝置設計，希望為香港首次承辦全運會及殘特奧會留下獨特印記。

比賽一共徵集到超過60份參賽作品，每一件都充滿創意，展現出設計團隊對全運會與殘特奧會的熱情與想像。所有作品經過專業評審，從可行性到設計理念等多方面進行評分，最終選出兩組優秀作品。

兩組脫穎而出的得獎設計分別是：《光．花．聚》以及《一步一腳印》，以富有創意的演繹方式，展現出十五運會和殘特奧會所提倡的「協作與團結」、「尊重與包容」以及「體育精神」。

建築師團隊發揮專業才華，只用了短短六個月時間，就將概念化為紙上設計，再變成在我們眼前的實體裝置，實在令人讚歎！

在大家附近的得獎作品《光．花．聚》，樹幹綻放着729朵花朵。729是三的六次方，寓意「三三不盡、六六無窮」，象徵粵港澳三地「同根同心」，也代表體育盛事薪火相傳、生生不息。這件作品也傳遞出多元團結的精神，寄語三地未來更多融合、共同發展。

另一個得獎作品《一步一腳印》，設置於啟德車站廣場兩端，由六米高的運動鞋與地面的大鞋印組成，表達「傷健共融」的主題，展現運動員堅毅踏實的精神，也呼應大灣區發展一路走來的堅實步伐。我知道裝置的運動鞋塑材是使用循環再用物料製成，充分體現環保與創意的結合。

今次比賽得以成功舉行，實在要多謝合作夥伴香港賽馬會的鼎力支持。馬會除了支持建築裝置設計比賽，更全力贊助支持不同籌備工作，包括義工服務、社區及學校推廣，以及為弱勢社群和青少年安排觀賽體驗等。

我也衷心感謝香港建築師學會促成這次合作。他們以專業嚴謹的態度參與評審，確保得獎作品能充分展現全運會的獨特意義和精神。

這次比賽體現了文化、體育、旅遊的結合。香港作為國際文化交流樞紐，我們相信兩組得獎建築裝置能夠為市民和遊客帶來新的體驗，共同見證香港首次承辦全運會這個歷史時刻。

很快，我們便能在全運會的舞台上，目睹運動員的堅持、拼搏和團隊精神。香港要向前邁進，這個「團隊精神」也很重要。我鼓勵各位在十二月七日，齊心支持立法會換屆選舉，用你手中的一票，選出愛國愛港的立法會議員為香港服務。

我再次恭賀各位得獎建築師，並感謝社會各界的支持。全運會的成功，實在有賴在座每一位的參與和貢獻。

再過三天，全運會香港賽區第一個競賽項目——沙灘排球，就會在維多利亞公園舉行。我誠邀廣大市民踴躍購票入場，為運動員打氣，一同感受全運會的熾熱氣氛！多謝大家。"

Bernard（香港賽馬會董事陳智思）、Paul（計劃首席研究員及香港大學香港賽馬會防止自殺研究中心總監葉兆輝教授）、Doris（計劃首席研究員及香港大學李嘉誠醫學院護理學院教授余秀鳳教授）：

很高興今日再來到荃灣參與香港賽馬會資助項目（啓動禮），我們數星期前才在這裏見面。今日，要祝賀賽馬會「樂載耆蹤」社區長者支援計劃舉行啓動禮。這四個字改得很好──「樂載耆蹤」，「耆蹤」的意思是追蹤長者，過程都是愉快的。

正如Bernard剛剛所說，香港現在面對高齡化的挑戰，表示我們多了很多長者。其實無論長者獨居也好、雙老或是多老同住也好，本身未必是問題。正如這裏很多都是小家庭，長者自己居住是很正常的。但如果長者自己獨居而並沒有社交網絡、沒有社區支援，那便是問題，需要我們要幫忙。

賽馬會一向與政府屬拍檔關係，通常都走得較前，經常試創新的東西。正如剛才Bernard所說，在二○二三年開始，賽馬會已經開始「樂載耆蹤」的構想，並逐步推展。隨後，特區政府亦提出了類似的概念，構想如何以最高效率找到社區上風險較高的長者，繼而為他們提供服務，讓他們得到社區支援。賽馬會的「樂載耆蹤」和今年政府推出利用社會福利署、醫管局（醫院管理局）及房屋署的大數據，尋找一些風險高的老友記，事實上是相輔相成的。尤其，我這段時間亦跟兩位大教授和其他朋友都談到，我們認為在公共房屋的大數據基本上都能找到被認為風險較高的老友記，因為有名冊作依照。但是，有些地方並不是那麼容易找到長者，例如「三無大廈」、偏遠的社區，或是住在不同種類的屋宇的長者，這些則有賴賽馬會「樂載耆蹤」的配合，找到一些我們很想幫忙卻又無從找到的長者。將來若有機會，我們可以探討是否能讓手上的大數據結合「樂載耆蹤」，提升效率。

這計劃更好的地方是，尋找到只是第一步，在尋找到需要幫助的長者後會提供幫助。他們會做簡單的家居改善，然後跟他們建立一個有信任的朋友關係，這正正為我們將來構建一個新的支援模式提供了一些參考。尤其是這計劃都是實證為本的，有香港大學的支援，這令我更期待在整個計劃完成後，與香港大學團隊和賽馬會了解哪些支援計劃的效率、效益特別高，繼而政府可以考慮將它融入恆常的支援。我現在特別關心住在「三無大廈」的人士，香港的社區與外國比較有一個特點，我們是垂直的城市，很多老人家年輕的時候，覺得住在高層沒問題的，景觀好一點。但隨着他們年齡漸長，而他們住的大廈沒有電梯，這是一個很大的挑戰。即使他有多大的意願，他的社交亦會受阻。但其實現在有很多樂齡科技，沒有升降機，但我們有樓梯機，這些我都想去探討當中的效益。但只有樓梯機也不夠，樓梯機要人操作，所以整個網絡如果能夠結合，我們可以幫助很多有需要的長者，讓他們可以重新融入社區，令他們覺得生活多了一份樂趣。他有困難的時候可以找到對象傾訴，然後可以求助，這裏我相信隨着「樂載耆蹤」的全面推行，政府可以從中取得很多關鍵數據，可以一起合作，為我們去應對香港的社會高齡化提供了很多值得參考的做法。

另外，一定要呼籲的，十二月七日是立法會換屆選舉，台下有社福機構的代表，又有很多老友記，大家應該一盡公民責任，好好運用我們手上的選票，出來投票，並呼籲身邊人投票，選出有志向、有承擔、有能力的人成為立法會議員。立法會議員和政府，以及各相關機構一定會通力合作，應對好社福的多方面挑戰，尤其是社會高齡化的挑戰。在這裏多謝各位參與，也都再一次呼籲大家出來投票，感謝大家。"
香港海關搗破網上店舖售賣懷疑冒牌物品及參與清洗黑錢（附圖）,2025-10-28 17:05,2025-10-28 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800546.htm,"香港海關十月二十日展開特別執法行動，偵破一宗透過網上店舖售賣懷疑冒牌鞋履及清洗黑錢案件，檢獲共約一千一百件懷疑冒牌物品，包括鞋履和服飾，估計市值共約二百萬元，案件涉及處理售賣懷疑冒牌物品的犯罪得益高達一千三百萬元，行動中拘捕兩人。

海關早前接獲市民舉報，指有網上店舖售賣冒牌鞋履，海關人員隨即展開調查。經深入調查及在商標持有人的協助下，海關人員於十月二十日採取執法行動，搜查一個位於荃灣的工廠大廈單位，並檢獲該批懷疑冒牌物品。

與此同時，經資金流向分析後，海關人員發現其中一名被捕人士涉嫌利用公司及個人銀行帳戶處理大量懷疑犯罪得益。該名被捕人士由二○二三年至今合共處理約一千三百萬元懷疑售賣冒牌物品的犯罪得益。

行動中，海關根據《商品說明條例》及《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》拘捕一名三十一歲男子及一名二十九歲女子，兩人為兄妹關係。

案件仍在調查中，被捕人士現正保釋候查，不排除會有更多人被捕。

海關呼籲消費者應光顧信譽良好的店鋪或網店，避免與可疑的商戶進行交易，如對貨品真偽有懷疑，應先向有關商標持有人或其代理商查詢。

海關一直致力保障消費者權益，並不時在市場及網上巡查。此外，海關人員會利用大數據系統作風險評估和分析，以確定網店是否符合《商品說明條例》的規定，加強保障消費者在網上購物的權益。

根據《商品說明條例》，任何人銷售或為售賣用途而管有冒牌物品，即屬違法。一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五十萬元及監禁五年。

而根據《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》，任何人士如知道或有合理理由相信任何財產，不論全部或部分、直接或間接，代表任何人從可公訴罪行的得益，而仍然處理該財產，即屬犯罪。一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及監禁十四年，而相關犯罪得益亦可被沒收。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑冒牌以及懷疑參與洗黑錢的活動。"
Hong Kong Customs raids online shop selling suspected counterfeit goods and engaging in money laundering (with photos),2025-10-28 17:05,2025-10-28 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800547.htm,"  Hong Kong Customs mounted a special enforcement operation on October 20 and detected a case involving the sale of suspected counterfeit footwear products and money laundering by an online shop. A total of about 1 100 items of suspected counterfeit goods, including footwear and clothing, with a total estimated market value of about $2 million, were seized. The suspected crime proceeds generated from the sale of suspected counterfeit goods involved in the case amounted to $13 million. Two persons were arrested.

  Customs earlier received information from the public, alleging that an online shop was offering counterfeit footwear for sale, and an investigation was then launched. After an in-depth investigation and with the assistance of trademark owners, Customs officers took enforcement action on October 20 and searched an industrial unit in Tsuen Wan, resulting in the seizure of the batch of suspected counterfeit goods.

  Meanwhile, fund-flow analysis revealed that one of the arrested persons was suspected of using corporate and personal bank accounts to deal with a large amount of suspected crime proceeds. A total of about $13 million of suspected crime proceeds generated from the sale of counterfeit goods had been handled by the arrested person since 2023.

  During the operation, a 31-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman, who are siblings, were arrested under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (TDO) and the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance (OSCO).

  An investigation is ongoing, and the arrested persons have been released on bail pending further investigation. The likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

  Customs reminds consumers to purchase goods at reputable shops or online shops and to avoid conducting transactions with suspicious traders. They should check with the trademark owners or their authorised agents if the authenticity of a product is in doubt.

  Customs has been striving to protect consumer rights and carries out inspections in the market and on the Internet from time to time. Moreover, Customs officers use a big-data analytics system to carry out risk assessments and analyses to verify whether online shops have complied with the TDO with a view to safeguarding the interests of consumers during online purchases.

  Under the TDO, any person who sells or possesses for sale any goods with a forged trademark commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

  Under the OSCO, a person commits an offence if he or she deals with any property knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that such property, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and imprisonment for 14 years, while the crime proceeds are also subject to confiscation.
â
  Members of the public may report any suspected counterfeiting activities and suspected money laundering activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Among the sixth batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 14 survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering three survey areas in October, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released six batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in October 2025, covering 58 survey areas. Among these 58 survey areas, 42 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. September 2025, representing that the areas’ mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Sixteen other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD is disseminating the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

十月份第六批涵蓋14個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及三個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十月共六批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共58個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年九月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這58個監察區中，42個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有16區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

金管局完成「數碼港元」先導計劃並闡述「數碼港元」的未來發展方向,2025-10-28 16:20,2025-10-28 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800316.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（十月二十八日）發布《「數碼港元」先導計劃第二階段報告》（報告），介紹「數碼港元」先導計劃第二階段（第二階段）下11組試驗的主要成果與經驗。報告亦闡述了金管局就「數碼港元」的最新政策立場。

金管局自二○一七年起對央行數碼貨幣（即「數碼港元」）開始進行研究，並以分布式分類帳技術作為基礎。研究工作涵蓋了「數碼港元」在批發及零售層面的潛在應用場景。第二階段評估了「數碼港元」在多種零售場景中的商業可行性及可擴展性，亦將「數碼港元」與代幣化存款（即代幣化形式的商業銀行存款）進行比較，以判斷「數碼港元」在零售場景中所能發揮的獨特價值。

第二階段的11組試驗涵蓋三大主題的創新用例，包括代幣化資產結算、可編程性及離線支付。試驗結果顯示「數碼港元」及代幣化存款能夠促進具成本效益、可編程及穩健的交易，為用戶帶來好處。試驗中更發現，鑑於香港健全的銀行監管制度及全面的消費者保障，市民高度信任香港穩健的銀行體系，因此市民對「數碼港元」與代幣化存款的接受程度相若。

由於「數碼港元」由金管局發行，不具有信貸風險，因此特別適合用於大額交易結算。金管局認為「數碼港元」現階段的需求集中於零售場景以外，因此未來將優先發展「數碼港元」應用於批發層面。有金融機構已經在一些用例中使用「數碼港元」，以支持代幣化生態系統的發展與跨境支付場景，例如國際貿易結算。

展望未來，金管局將繼續推進政策、法律及技術等方面的前期準備工作，為香港未來可能將「數碼港元」推廣至可供個人及企業使用做好準備。相關準備工作預計於二○二六年上半年完成，而擴展「數碼港元」的時機將根據國際發展、最新科技發展及市場需求作出調整。

作為「數碼港元」業界論壇的主要成果之一，金管局將公布一套共用代幣化標準，以促進數碼貨幣可編程性的廣泛應用。這些標準旨在為「數碼港元」的未來發展和應用奠定基礎，以滿足香港個人及企業的支付需求。

金管局總裁余偉文表示：「『數碼港元』先導計劃的兩個階段取得了豐富的成果，有助於金管局深入了解數碼貨幣的未來發展。我們樂見『數碼港元』已逐步被金融機構應用於更多批發層面的場景。金管局將繼續致力為未來可能擴展『數碼港元』至零售場景使用做好準備。我們衷心感謝『數碼港元』先導計劃的所有參與者在過去三年中的積極投入和寶貴貢獻。我們期待在央行數碼貨幣與代幣化進程中，繼續與業界緊密合作。」

HKMA completes e-HKD Pilot Programme and outlines future direction of e-HKD,2025-10-28 16:20,2025-10-28 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800311.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) today (October 28) published the ""e-HKD Pilot Programme Phase 2 Report"" (the report), which presents the key findings and learnings from 11 groups of industry pilots under Phase 2 of the e-HKD Pilot Programme (Phase 2). The report also sets out the HKMA's latest policy stance regarding the e-HKD.

  Since 2017, the HKMA has begun explorative work on a central bank digital currency (CBDC), i.e. an e-HKD, using distributed ledger technology (DLT) as its foundation. This work has covered the potential applications of an e-HKD in both wholesale and retail scenarios. Phaseâ¯2 evaluated the commercial viability and scalability of an eâHKD in various retail scenarios. It also compared an e-HKD with tokenised deposits (a tokenised representation of bank deposits) to assess the distinctive value that an e-HKD can bring in retail scenarios.

The 11 pilots under Phase 2 explored innovative use cases across three main themes, namely settlement of tokenised assets, programmability, and offline payments. The results of the pilots demonstrated that an e-HKD and tokenised deposits can deliver benefits by enabling costâefficient, programmable, and resilient transactions. A key finding was that the public perceived an e-HKD and tokenised deposits similarly, given the public's high level of trust in Hong Kong's stable banking system, underpinned by a robust supervisory regime and strong consumer protection.

As the e-HKD is issued by the HKMA and is free from credit risk, it is particularly well-suited for large-value transactions. The HKMA has therefore concluded that the immediate priority for the e-HKD lies in areas beyond retail use cases at this stage and will hence prioritise the future e-HKD work in wholesale payments, which has already been implemented in some applications, to support the development of the tokenisation ecosystem and cross-border payments, such as settlements of international trade.

Going forward, the HKMA will continue its effort to prepare a solid policy, legal, and technical foundation, with the aim to lay the ground for potential future use of an e-HKD for individuals and corporates in Hong Kong. This preparatory work will be completed by the first half of 2026, and the timeframe for implementing any such extension would be subject to international developments, latest technologies, and market needs.

As one of the key outcomes of the e-HKD Industry Forum, the HKMA will publish a set of common token standards, which will serve to facilitate the scaled adoption of programmability in digital money. These standards are intended to provide a foundation for the potential future development and adoption of an e-HKD aimed at serving the needs of individuals and corporates in Hong Kong.

The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue,said ""The two phases of the e-HKD Pilot Programme have yielded insightful findings that shape the HKMA's understanding of the future of digital money. We are encouraged to see that the e-HKD has gradually been used in more wholesale applications by financial institutions, and we will continue to ensure Hong Kong is well-prepared for the potential future extension of the e-HKD in retail scenarios. We thank all participants of the e-HKD Pilot Programme for their strong commitment and contribution over the past three years. We look forward to continuing our close partnership with the industry as part of our CBDC and tokenisation journey.""

The report is available on the HKMA website. Details of each pilot can be found in the factsheets and supplementary reports prepared by the pilot participants, accessible via the links in Appendix A of the report."

林文健醫生說：「現場所見，學生不論是選擇噴鼻式或是注射式流感疫苗，接種過程都非常順利，這端賴醫療外展隊和校方的妥善安排和充分的事前準備。為鼓勵學童接種季節性流感疫苗，衞生署今年推出優化措施，所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗或『混合模式』，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。」

他續說：「衞生防護中心（中心）今年提早於六月初開始接受學校報名參加季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃（計劃）。在政府和社會各界（包括醫療界和學校等）的共同努力下，有約2 300間學校（總數的99%）會舉行流感疫苗學校外展活動。而開學至今，已有約980間學校舉行季節性流感疫苗學校外展活動，較上一季度同期約800間為高。另外共約2 190間學校（95%）會於下月（十一月）底或之前進行，較去年的83%高。總括而言，今年學校外展活動普遍將早於上一季度完成。早前，已有23間學校應中心呼籲，將原訂於今年十二月或明年一月舉行疫苗接種活動學校，提前至下月底前舉行疫苗接種活動。面對夏季和冬季流感有可能重疊，我呼籲原訂於今年十二月舉行疫苗接種活動的學校，盡可能提前舉行疫苗接種活動。如安排上遇有任何困難，可於辦公時間內致電中心（電話：3975 4872），中心定當全力協助。」

陪同林文健醫生視察的中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據過往經驗，學校參與計劃能顯著提高學童流感疫苗接種率逾一倍。政府、學校和家長三方通力合作，提升疫苗接種覆蓋，才能有效加強學童免疫屏障。本港正值夏季流感季節，學校的流感樣疾病爆發個案自九月起大幅上升。截至十月二十七日，九月開學後涉及學校的爆發個案共有677宗，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（71宗）、小學（369宗）及中學（237宗）。中心由開學至今錄得14宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，當中包括一宗死亡個案，年齡介乎2至17歲，其中11人過往的健康狀況良好。按目前流感活躍程度和趨勢分析，流感活躍程度在未來幾星期預計會維持在較高水平。另一方面，氣溫下降，病毒一般會較活躍。香港的冬季流感季節大多在一月至三月期間出現，今次夏季流感季節有可能與下一個冬季流感重疊，導致因感染流感而住院的人數較以往更多。」

所有年滿六個月或以上人士，除有已知禁忌症外，均應接種流感疫苗，保障自己及家人的健康。政府已開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有六個月至兩歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下18區的地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的74間家庭醫學診所和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。

林文健醫生說：「計劃開展至今，各項季節性流感疫苗接種計劃共接種超過100萬劑疫苗，較去年同期上升約5.4%，但六個月至兩歲以下兒童的覆蓋率相對偏低，只有約10%。我們期望社會各界攜手呼籲家長安排子女參加流感疫苗接種，並同教導家長接種疫苗的重要性，以推動更多幼童接種疫苗，提高覆蓋率，加強保障小朋友。」

有關最新的資訊，市民可參閱中心流感網頁或疫苗接種計劃專頁以了解詳情。"

律政司司長在北京出席2025金融街論壇年會金融法治論壇致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-28 14:38,2025-10-28 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800384.htm,"以下是律政司司長林定國資深大律師今日（十月二十八日）在北京出席2025金融街論壇年會金融法治論壇的致辭：

尊敬的各位領導、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：

大家早上好。我非常榮幸能夠出席今日這個重要的論壇。首先，我想感謝北京金融法院提供這個平台，讓我有機會就「深化京港合作，提升涉外法治建設水平」這個議題，與大家分享我的一點意見。

在「一國兩制」下，香港不僅保留亦持續發展其獨特的法律和金融制度，而兩者關係更是密不可分。香港今日能成為人所共知的國際金融中心，其中一個重要原因是擁有一個以普通法為基礎的高度法治環境。香港的金融法律制度，一方面便利和促進資金自由進出、各類金融活動有序進行，另一方面公平有效地保障投資者和其他持份者的合法權益。

就京港這方面的合作而言，我認為香港能發揮起碼以下三項功能： 一是為以北京為基地的各類企業「出海」或與外方合作時作為一個融資平台；二是為北京金融法治建設提供一個參考；三是以累積的經驗和知識協助北京培養金融法律服務人才。要充分和有效合作、讓香港發揮上述功能，前提是必須對香港現行金融法律制度的一些基本架構和概念，以至最新的發展有一定的理解。故此，我希望用今天的寶貴機會作簡單報告。

現行多管齊下的嚴謹執法機制

確保所有金融活動嚴格依法進行，所有違法者受法律制裁，是維持大眾對金融制度信心的關鍵。香港對金融市場一向採取多管齊下的執法機制，以有效涵蓋所有風險與違規情形。其中，香港證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）專注於證券期貨領域的監管；而香港交易所（港交所）則透過其上市委員會，監管上市發行人及上市公司。如果案件涉及其他商業詐騙或貪污等罪行，香港警務處以及廉政公署更會介入調查。

以證監會為例，在香港法例第571章《證券及期貨條例》下，證監會可透過民事及刑事雙軌制裁機制有效地打擊內幕交易等市場失當行為。首先，就民事方面，我們設立了市場失當行為審裁處，由一名高等法院法官或前法官出任主席及兩名成員組成，獲賦權處理各種形式的市場失當行為個案，包括內幕交易、操縱市場等。該審裁處會以較易達到的民事舉證標準作出裁決，並可施加多種民事制裁，例如下令違規者交出所賺取的利潤、發出停止及終止令，以及撤銷違規者出任公司董事等。就刑事方面，如果證據充分及符合公眾利益，犯案者會遭受刑事檢控。一經定罪，最高可被判入獄10年及罰款港幣1,000萬元。這種雙軌並行的制度，可提高靈活度並確保法律的嚴格執行。

值得一提的是，《證券及期貨條例》的部分條例具有域外效力。在SFC v Subotic (2023)一案中，香港終審法院裁定證監會有權不經法院許可，直接向境外被告發出訴訟文件，並確認證監會可向法院對境外違法者申請單方面資產凍結強制令。該判決肯定了證監會打擊跨境市場失當行為的能力。

除了執法機關的努力外，香港法院對涉及金融市場的其他刑事罪行也採取極為嚴厲的態度。例如，近年針對使用傀儡戶口的洗黑錢案件，法院會應控方的申請對罪犯的刑期加幅高達三分之一，通過嚴厲判刑達致阻嚇效果，有效保護香港作為國際金融中心的聲譽。

香港金融法律體系的持續更新

另一方面，為確保監管框架能回應新挑戰，香港會根據市場發展與新興風險，不斷檢視現行機制並調整相關法例。

以虛擬資產為例，虛擬資產交易日趨活躍，大部分交易均通過虛擬資產交易平台進行。不少投資者會把虛擬資產投放在交易平台以賺取回報。為保障投資者及減低對傳統金融體系構成風險，我們於二○二三年六月實施了虛擬資產交易平台發牌制度——所有在香港經營業務，或向香港投資者積極推廣其服務的中央虛擬資產交易平台，都須獲證監會發牌並遵守相關的監管規定。

近年來，與法定貨幣掛鉤的數位資產——穩定幣——迅速崛起。今年八月，我們推出了《穩定幣條例》以監管涉及穩定幣的活動及設立發牌制度。條例實施後，任何人如在香港發行法幣穩定幣，或在香港或以外發行宣稱錨定港元價值的法幣穩定幣，必須向金融管理專員申領牌照。相關人士須符合儲備資產管理及贖回等方面的規定，包括妥善分隔客戶資產、維持健全的穩定機制等。《穩定幣條例》進一步完善香港數字資產活動監管框架，以保障貨幣和金融穩定，並鞏固提升香港國際金融中心的地位。

為進一步加強投資者保障，財經事務及庫務局與證監會在今年六月底展開聯合諮詢引入針對虛擬資產交易服務和託管服務者的監管制度，計劃賦權證監會向虛擬資產交易服務提供者和託管服務提供者發牌並進行監督，並執行相關規例，證監會亦會負責為這兩類重要服務提供者制訂合規標準。此外，我們也建議修訂相關法律，限制使用某些可能會誤導投資者的稱銜，如限制會讓投資者誤以為某行業務或營運已受到證監會監管的稱銜。

法律人才培訓

剛才我提及涉外法治人才培訓。我們律政司在去年十一月正式啓動成立香港國際法律人才培訓學院，透過善用香港中英雙語普通法制度和國際化格局，為包括內地的法律界人士提供能力建設、知識和經驗分享的平台，例如學院剛舉辦了中國企業出海法律實務培訓班，向參加培訓班的33位中央直屬國有企業的法務主管及合規主任探討中國企業「出海」的風險及其適用的合規策略，當中包括有關香港穩定幣的專題講座和監管香港證券及期貨市場的座談環節。我們期待與北京金融法院和不同單位商討，量身打造針對性的培訓課程，培育優秀涉外法律人才。

在「一國兩制」下，香港必須更善用其制度獨特優勢，更好融入國家發展大局。其中重要一環，就是加強與北京及其他內地城市在金融法治建設方面的合作。我期待與北京涉及金融法治建設各單位共同探討，如何制定和落實具體措施，深化合作，攜手提升涉外法治建設水平，為中國式現代化進一步改革開放作出必要和更大的貢獻。最後，我預祝今日的論壇圓滿成功。謝謝。"

It is my great pleasure to welcome you all today for the opening of the 20th Eco Expo Asia - a remarkable milestone in Hong Kong's journey towards sustainability. Over the past two decades, the Eco Expo Asia has evolved into a leading platform for innovation, knowledge exchange and partnership in tackling global environmental challenges with tremendous support from all over the world. We have brought together delegations from various provinces and cities on the Chinese Mainland, ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) as well as Belt and Road countries joining this signature annual environmental trade event to strive for a sustainable future.

In the global journey towards sustainability, Hong Kong serves as a ""super connector"". With our unique position as an international city within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and a bridge between the Chinese Mainland and the world, Hong Kong brings together talent, technology, and capital to foster collaboration and scale up green innovation.

To advance our commitment to promoting participation in green co-operation, I am pleased to announce today that the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment will sign a co-operation agreement on jointly setting up a Belt and Road green development co-operation platform in Hong Kong. This platform will connect international environmental co-operation networks and facilitate technology exchanges and transfers of solutions among Belt and Road countries. I would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to the Central Government for its support for this collaborative initiative, and to our partner, the Belt and Road Initiative International Green Development Coalition.

Quality training is essential for talent growth. We will establish a Belt and Road sustainable green development training centre in 2026 in collaboration with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, IHE Delft (IHE Delft Institute for Water Education) and local bodies to provide high-quality environmental training for professionals from Belt and Road countries, Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland. The Centre will serve as a hub in the international sustainable development network, nurturing talent and supporting the exchange of green technologies across Belt and Road economies. We have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with IHE Delft to establish, under the Centre, the Global Sanitation Graduate School Regional Hub East Asia in Hong Kong next year, positioning Hong Kong as a leading gateway for cutting-edge environmental training and global partnerships.

 The theme of this year's Expo is ""Green Innovations for Carbon Neutrality"", it reflects both the urgency as well as the opportunity of our time. Climate change remains an urgent global challenge that demands creativity, co-operation and commitment. Green innovations, from renewable solutions to smart city green ideas, hold the key to accelerating our transition towards a net-zero future.

To tie in the country's dual carbon targets, Hong Kong is firmly committed to reaching carbon neutrality before 2050 with four key areas of focus: net-zero electricity generation, green transport, green buildings and waste reduction. Hong Kong is making good progress to meet this target. Our carbon emissions peaked in 2014, and compared to the peak, our carbon emissions today has been reduced almost 30 per cent already. Our carbon emissions per capita is only about one quarter of the United States, and about 60 per cent of that of the European Union.

Of course, the journey to achieving carbon neutrality cannot go without new energy solutions and green technologies. The Hong Kong Government is committed to support local development of green technologies to promote the commercialisation of green I&T (innovation and technology) outcomes. Let me share with you two inspiring examples from the city. A local company plans to establish a factory using recycled plastic to produce acoustic metamaterials, initially processing 3 500 tonnes of household plastic annually, doubling to 7 000 tonnes within five years. Another local company is setting up a production line using recycled materials like tiles and glass to create electricity-free cooling products, promoting the circular economy and sustainable productivity. You are most welcome to visit their booth, which is right next to the Hong Kong Government booth, to learn more about their stories.

Apart from these, we also support development of the sustainable aviation fuel value chain, launching of hydrogen trial projects in different areas, market development of technologies for battery-swapping electric vehicles and automated battery-swapping stations, district cooling systems, and promotion of carbon reduction in existing buildings.

China stands at the forefront of global green innovation and industrial transformation. With the support from the Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, we are co-organising a technical visit to Hunan province for our Belt and Road delegations. This city's international connectivity ensures that Chinese green innovations can be deployed, scaled and commercialised globally, amplifying their impact well beyond our borders.

Ladies and gentlemen, bringing together policy makers, innovators, investors and businesses, this Expo exemplifies the power of collaboration - helping governments and enterprises transform groundbreaking technologies and strategic ambitions into concrete progress for carbon neutrality.

I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council as well as all exhibitors and participants for making this Expo a global showcase of green leadership. Let us continue to work together to drive the world through the low carbon green transition to a better world for our children.

I wish the Expo every success, and to all of you, good health, good business, and a happy stay in Hong Kong. Thank you."

TACO of DH introduces smart tools for filling in fixed penalty notices to enhance efficiency,2025-10-28 14:00,2025-10-28 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800250.htm,"âThe Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the Department of Health announced today (October 28) that frontline TACO officers will start using smart tools for issuing fixed penalty notices (FPNs) from October 30. This initiative will streamline procedures, improve data accuracy and enhance enforcement efficiency.

Frontline TACO officers are empowered to enforce the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Cap. 371), which includes taking prosecution actions against individuals who smoke in statutory no-smoking areas or on public transport carriers.

Currently, TACO officers need to manually fill in offenders' personal details on printed FPNs during enforcement. Staff in the back office then check the information and input it into the backend system.

Starting October 30, when issuing FPNs to offenders, TACO officers will be able to scan offenders' Hong Kong identity (HKID) cards using an electronic system, which will instantly import the offender's personal details, such as name and HKID number, into the FPN. The system will also automatically record the time, location and details of the enforcement officers. Officers will print the FPNs on the spot using portable printers and issue them to the offenders. The data will be automatically synchronised with the backend system, saving processing time and manpower needs in the back office while improving overall efficiency.

Neither TACO officers nor the relevant mobile application will store images of the offenders' HKID cards. The personal data collected during enforcement will remain the same as that currently recorded manually.

The Director of Health, empowered under section 17A of the Fixed Penalty (Smoking Offences) Ordinance (Cap. 600), has specified the formats for both handwritten and mobile-printed FPNs (see Annex). Although the two versions of FPNs differ slightly in format, their content is identical and both carry the same legal effect. Offenders may still be issued handwritten FPNs by TACO or other law enforcement departments."

Remarks by CE at media session before ExCo,2025-10-28 13:50,2025-10-28 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800387.htm,"  Following are the remarks by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at a media session before the Executive Council meeting today (October 28):

Reporter: Good morning, Chief Executive. First, how do you see the LegCo (Legislative Council) breaking from tradition to call off the farewell motion and banquet and its implication on the future executive-legislative relationship? You mentioned the LegCo election (Legislative Council General Election). Do you expect a higher turnout rate than in 2021, following the Government's efforts to encourage residents to vote? And there are reports that the Government sent officials to Macao to study its experience with mobilisation for the LegCo election. What are the key takeaways for the visit? And second for the cargo plane crash last week. How would the Government do to ensure that the authorities can hold all relevant parties accountable and ensure the crew members stay in Hong Kong throughout the entire investigation process? Thank you.

Chief Executive: Legislative Council Members discussed among themselves to make arrangements to suit their best interest and also to accommodate their busy work. I respect that decision. I also fully appreciate why they made a decision about what they would do, and did it. The upcoming Legislative Council General Election is a very important election. It affects everybody because the Government's policies implementation will mostly have to go through LegCo through enacting laws or through LegCo funding. So it is important to ensure that we have the most appropriate LegCo Members serving the interests of Hong Kong. It affects everybody, and it is a civic responsibility for voters to vote. It is also a civic responsibility for everybody to promote the election so that such a significant event will take its course smoothly and attract the most attention and support from everybody.

  The nomination period for the 2025 Legislative Council General Election began last Friday and so far, up to yesterday, already 50 candidates have reported their intention to run for the election. It will be a fierce competition, and candidates will have to compete by their election platforms, capabilities and performances, but it will be a healthy competition. The Chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission has already made an appeal for everybody to take part in the election and cast their vote, and has also appealed to organisations and businesses to encourage their employees to vote and also to facilitate their employees when they have to vote during their day of work. The Government will do the same. The Government will, first of all, respond to the appeal by the Chairman, and I'll be writing to all civil servants to encourage them to act as an example, to exercise their civic responsibility to vote. It affects their daily work as well, because we work very closely with the Legislative Council on a daily basis. It is an important election and the whole Government will do our best to promote it, and appeal to everybody in society to do the same to promote it. It is an important duty for the Government. This is also a matter of great significance for everybody to participate in, to encourage others to take part. So it is a collective effort of Hong Kong, and the aim is to do it well in all aspects.

  So the goal we set for ourselves is: do our best in all elements of the election, and we'll do our best to achieve that goal. We try to make this a successful election. That is why we look to the good practices of all places beyond us. In particular, Macao has recently done a very successful election, and we have been in good exchange with our colleagues in the Macao Special Administrative Region Government and what we are doing, in fact, reinforces the good experiences that we learnt from our Macao counterparts and also different parts of the world. In other words, we have to raise people's awareness, interest and understanding of the significance of the election, and then we'll do a full-scale mobilisation of not just the Government, but the whole of Hong Kong. We'll appeal to everybody to exercise our civic responsibility, appeal to everybody to vote, and appeal to organisations and businesses to encourage their staff to vote. It is a whole-city campaign. The candidates have to work well, and they will have to do their best, and they will have to display to the community, to their voters, that they are the appropriate candidates who should be elected to become a LegCo Member. So the candidates will have to work hard, the Government will work hard, and all of society should join forces to make sure this is a good success. We'll make that aim our efforts in the run-up to December 7.

  In respect of the incident in which a cargo plane ran into the sea, causing two deaths, I am deeply saddened by the passing away of the two security officers in the incident. I extend my deepest condolences, and express my profound sympathy to the families. I'm highly concerned about the incident and have instructed the Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB) to co-ordinate and take expedited action. First, we will conduct a thorough and immediate investigation to find out the cause of the incident. If there are violations of the laws or regulations, we shall hold the responsible persons accountable. Second, provide full assistance to the families to help them go through the difficult time. And third, ensure all operations comply with international civil aviation safety standards, including airport operations, infrastructure and the safety of staff and passengers.

  The TLB has been handling the incident fast, and they have immediately met with the Turkish authorities to convey our concerns about the incident and the wishes of the affected families, and co-ordinated with the cargo airline company, and various organisations and departments for quick response and follow-up management. The salvage work was completed last night, and the North Runway has reopened, and now the airport is running as usual. The Government is very concerned about the incident, and we share the family's hope to identify the cause of the accident as soon as possible. We have asked the Air Accident Investigation Authority to conduct an in-depth investigation expeditiously. The Authority is now conducting a comprehensive investigation with the scope covering areas such as crew qualifications, flight operations, aircraft systems, maintenance records and the weather. It will conduct an in-depth analysis of the two retrieved ""black boxes"" to find out the sequence of the event. Overseas experts will also participate to ensure a professional, objective and fact-based investigation. A preliminary investigation report is expected to be issued within a month.

  Aircraft accident investigations are complex investigations involving aircraft designers, manufacturers, the relevant airlines and personnel, encompassing expertise, companies and individuals from different countries or regions. Based on past experience, the full investigation will take time, but I have already asked the Air Accident Investigation Authority to ascertain the cause of the incident as quickly as possible. The Government will provide sufficient resources, and all departments will offer their full support. The Police will continue their investigation. Laboratory tests confirmed that all crew members tested negative for alcohol and drugs. The Police will further study the findings of the Air Accident Investigation Authority’s inquiry to determine the direction of the police investigation.

  Regarding the aircraft and crew involved, the crew members involved have been staying in Hong Kong since the incident. The Turkish authorities have pledged their commitments to co-ordinate with the cargo airline company and relevant personnel to co-operate with the related work and the investigation. Concurrently, the Turkish authorities have assisted in arranging for representatives of the involved airline company to meet with the affected families last Friday. The company expressed condolences to the families and indicated an ex gratia relief payment will be provided. We'll do our best to assist in the investigation, and our aim is to finish it as expeditiously as possible. Thank you.

行政長官於行政會議前會見傳媒開場發言及答問內容,2025-10-28 13:50,2025-10-28 14:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800382.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十月二十八日）上午出席行政會議前會見傳媒的開場發言及答問內容：

行政長官：大家早晨。今日跟大家講兩件事，一是立法會選舉，另一是未來十天我將會連續進行兩次重要外訪。

首先是立法會選舉。二○二五年立法會換屆選舉的提名期在上星期五展開，截至昨日，選舉主任共接獲50份提名表格。我再次鼓勵愛國愛港、有能力、有擔當、熱心服務市民的賢能人才積極參選。選舉的競爭會是熱烈的，候選人將以政綱論高低、以能力決勝負、以表現爭認可，將會是一場高質量、高水平的良性競爭。

立法會是特區政治體制的重要組成部分，許多政府政策都要經過立法會立法或撥款才可正式落實，因此立法會選舉至關重要。特區政府會全力推動和落實好選舉工作，尤其三方面。

第一，確保選舉公平、公正、誠實、安全有序舉行。立法會選舉由特區全責舉行。特區政府會全力辦好今次的立法會選舉，包括改善和優化各項選務安排和選舉流程，令選舉全流程暢順進行，會確保選舉公平、公正、誠實、安全有序地舉行，讓候選人悉心全力以赴進行競選工程，包括介紹政綱、組織推介、宣傳和參與辯論論壇等，讓不同組別的候選人熱烈投入，良性競爭，讓市民更認識他們，營造全城投入競選和投票的熱烈氛圍。

第二，堅決防範和打擊任何干擾、破壞選舉的行為。跡象顯示，反中亂港分子和外部勢力，試圖干擾破壞立法會選舉，他們造謠生事，目的是否定新選舉制度。中央政府對香港特區擁有全面管治權。立法會選舉關乎特區憲制秩序，國家安全，和特區良政善治，中央關心和重視是天經地義，尤其新一屆立法會正處於香港發展的關鍵階段，意義重大。但反對勢力和軟對抗試圖把這些理所當然的重視和關心，抹黑為干預。另外，不同議員展現愛國愛港情懷和高風亮節，交棒給新議員，薪火相傳，這些正常換屆的人事更替，卻被刻意歪曲，並炮製各種名目的所謂限制、所謂祝福名單，抹黑新選舉制度，特區政府必須義正嚴詞，直斥其非，我們會對任何破壞選舉的違法行為，嚴厲依法打擊。

第三，積極鼓勵社會各界支持和投入選舉。在十月二十三日立法會選舉啓動禮上，選管會主席陸啟康法官呼籲選民履行公民責任踴躍投票，呼籲僱主鼓勵員工投票，並提供一切可行便利方便員工投票。特區政府作為香港的最大僱主，會帶頭響應選管會主席的號召，我會在今日發信給所有公務員同事，呼籲及鼓勵他們以身作則，履行公民責任，踴躍投票，政府亦會為當日需要值班的公務員提供一切可行便利。我見到不少機構、企業、組織和團體都表示會推出措施，鼓勵和提供便利給員工在投票日積極投票。特區政府會推動和呼籲更多機構和企業加入，履行社會責任。

投票是每一位選民都應履行的公民責任。我再次呼籲，大家必須珍惜手中選票，在十二月七日踴躍投票，選賢與能，為香港共同家園的更好未來投下神聖的一票。

另外，我會在未來十天，接連外訪，出席兩個重要會議。

我會在明日啓程前往韓國慶州市，出席二○二五年亞太區經濟合作組織（亞太經合組織APEC）領導人非正式會議。參加一系列APEC會議和活動，包括亞太經合組織領導人會議，以及主辦方為與會領袖所設的歡迎晚宴。在會議期間，我亦會與其他參加會議的經濟體領導人進行雙邊會談，探討擴大合作的新機遇。

今年APEC的主題是「我們構築的可持續明天」（Building a Sustainable Tomorrow），會議將重點討論貿易與投資、人工智能以及人口結構變化等議題，與特區政府的施政方向一致。

APEC的成員經濟體佔本港外貿總值約八成，是香港重要的貿易夥伴。APEC是香港進一步加強與區內經貿合作的重要平台。香港近年在深化國際經貿網絡、招商引資、推動人工智能和科技革新等方面，都以改革思維推出不少新措施，我期待在APEC會議上分享香港在這方面的政策和經驗。

APEC會議完畢，我將於十一月二日（星期日）返港，並會隔一天後，即十一月四日（星期二）率領香港代表團前往上海，出席於十一月五日開幕的第八屆中國國際進口博覽會（進博會）。

進博會是全球首個以進口為主題的國家級展會，是國際矚目的盛事。今屆進博會繼續秉持「新時代，共享未來」的主題，將有來自110多個國家和地區的3 200多家企業參與企業商業展。

今年有超過350家香港企業參展，數目創歷來新高，佔企業參展商的一成以上，行業包括食品及農產品、消費品、醫療器械及醫藥保健、服務貿易，以及創新孵化等。這反映香港企業視進博會為開拓內銷以及展示香港品牌的重要平台。

香港貿易發展局今年會繼續在展會內設立兩個展區，由50多家香港企業推廣我們的優質產品和服務，當中24家，即超過四成，屬首度參展，分別從事食品、醫藥、科技、專業服務、教育等領域。我們亦會繼續在國家館設立香港展示區，介紹香港的成就、優勢和最新機遇。

我在上海期間亦會主持由特區政府舉辦的「香港：內地企業出海首選平台」推介大會，這個是特區政府新成立的「內地企業出海專班」首場內地大型宣傳活動，以「香港通道滬港攜手邁向全球」為主題，滙聚跨界別講者介紹香港作為國際平台「出海」的優勢，由重點企業分享利用香港「出海」的成功經驗，香港及內地企業將探討如何在創新科技、金融及專業服務等領域實現優勢互補。我們會特別舉行以創新科技和「出海」為專題的對接會，向內地企業深度推介利用香港「出海」的發展機遇。

謝謝大家。

記者：特首，你好。關於立法會換屆選舉。今次有不少新臉孔參選，甚至包括一些「政治素人」，你認為這會否影響市民的投票意欲？政府有甚麼措施可以提高投票率？政府對投票率有否定下目標，如坊間傳聞的30%？另外，特首早前表明公務員作為政府團隊一員，應該以身作則，投票支持政府施政，政府會否要求公務員必須投票或作出申報，不投票的公務員會否被懲罰？

行政長官：立法會選舉是一個重要活動，對香港的意義是重大的，因為立法會是憲制秩序其中一個重要組成部分，有很多特區政府的政策要經過立法會立法或者撥款才可落實。因此政府會全面做好立法會選舉工作。

今次我相信參與競選的人士會很努力互相比拼政綱，介紹自己、推廣自己，以及參與辯論。這個氣氛會帶動大家對選舉的重視、留意和投入。我亦希望所有人士均很積極投入選舉，因為它對香港每個人都有重要意義。

這是靠每一個人努力推動今次選舉工程，因為它涉及每個人的利益，涉及選民用自己的一票投下他認為最合適的議員，從而參與共同管治香港。各方面都要努力，參選人要努力，政府會努力，而所有人士都應該履行社會責任和公民責任投票和積極投入選舉。

每次選舉都一定會有部分人士或議題令大家特別留意。所以每一個參選人對於地區也好、整個社會發生的事情也好，表達自己在這方面的看法、會做甚麼、會代表甚麼角度讓大家認為他是一個好的、合適的立法會議員，這會帶動整個投票氣氛，所以各方面都要努力。

從政府的角度，今次立法會選舉的意義這麼重大，政府會全面做到最好，所定下的指標就是多方面都要做到最好，沒有任何其他硬指標，但是做到最好就是我們的指標。

有關公務員投票，我認為公務員是特區政府落實政策的重要成員，所以選出適合的立法會議員對於政府施政很重要，亦影響公務員的日常工作，因為立法會議員的意見、立法會議員如何行使其權力，以及日常如何與政府互相配合和互相制衡，這影響每個公務員的日常工作。因此公務員作為政府的重要成員，應該履行公民責任，以身作則投票。

我今日會發信予所有公務員，指出公務員有特別角色，作為政府的重要成員，亦是落實政府的政策，亦與立法會很多運作息息相關，應該以身作則，履行公民責任投票，亦應該推動整個香港熱烈搞活氣氛，以及推動香港市民重視和投入選舉工程。

記者：特首，你好。想請教兩方面問題，第一方面是關於基孔肯雅熱，現時本地個案增多，政府內部評估爆發風險高嗎？現時加強滅蚊是否已經足以處理這個有可能爆發的情況？可能在學校出現爆發時，因為見到有個案涉及一名學校職員，在學校出現一些疑似爆發，有多少宗個案就會有停課打算，有否這個指標？有沒有評估其他地區，是否都會有本地個案出現，政府如何應對？第二個問題想跟進貨機墮海事件，現時調查進度如何？「黑盒」已經找到，調查和取得「黑盒」內的資料，是否有結果和進度如何？到底是涉及機件故障，還是人為疏忽？有意見擔心機組人員萬一離開香港，追查會有難度，現行制度會如何規管？萬一真是涉及他們的問題，會如何追究責任？

行政長官：星期日錄得本地第一宗基孔肯雅熱的本地個案，而昨日亦新增三宗，包括兩宗輸入個案和一宗感染源頭有待確認的個案。基孔肯雅熱不是人傳人的病症，一般來說是會痊癒的，是經過蚊子叮咬感染者後，再叮咬其他人，令第二位人士可能受感染，所以不會人傳人，一般來說可以自行痊癒，死亡個案亦十分罕見。政府在這方面能管控及阻截蚊子的散播和傳染是重要的，所以首要任務是滅蚊，還要讓市民知道如何防範，減低受蚊叮後感染這個病症的風險。第一，一定要加強滅蚊和防蚊。環境及生態局昨日已經召開防治蟲鼠督導委員會，指導各部門在其範疇加強滅蚊、防蚊。環境及生態局局長昨日亦到黃大仙鳳德邨和附近一帶考察和指導滅蚊工作，而食物環境衞生署在患者居住附近250米範圍，特別是樹木茂盛的地方，進行密集式的霧化處理以殺蚊、滅蚊和清理積水。我亦特別留意學校、長者和幼兒設施，提醒和協助他們滅蚊，亦會巡查高風險地點，例如地盤，大家在這方面都要做好滅蚊、防蚊的工作。

另外，就是即時了解和跟進區內的居民健康情況，衞生防護中心和關愛隊已經聯絡當區的8 000戶居民進行問卷調查，中心已經在當區商場設立醫護站，為居民作評估，並舉辦教育講座。參加網上講座的人士非常熱烈，在網上觀看的人達4 000多人。事實上，政府一向有進行滅蚊工作。過去在二○一八年，曾經有登革熱傳染個案的上升數字，但因為政府和各界都努力滅蚊、防蚊以及清除積水和垃圾等，盡量減少蚊子的滋生機會，所以在二○一八年當登革熱個案上升時，成功打斷它的傳播鏈，從而控制當時情況。最重要是大家都要滅蚊、防蚊，還有保護自己，盡量減低感染風險，這方面政府會努力做，亦希望每個人都參與，令蚊患減到最少，防範這個疾病的傳染風險。基孔肯雅熱不是本土病，我們會全力滅蚊，確保不會在本地扎根。

另外，有關貨機墮海事件，我對在事件中，兩名保安人員不幸身故感到痛心，表示深切哀悼，亦向他們的家人致以深切慰問。我高度關注事件，已指示運輸及物流局全面統籌和迅速處理，特別是三方面的跟進：第一是全面、全速徹查事件，找出事故原因，如有違法、違規，必須追究責任；第二，全力協助家屬，助他們渡過難關；第三，確保一切運作符合國際民航安全標準，包括機場運作、基建、工作人員和乘客安全。運輸及物流局在意外發生後，即時迅速處理事件，包括跟土耳其當局會面，表達我們對事件的關注和受影響家屬的意願，協調涉事貨機的公司、不同機構與部門迅速應對和善後。打撈工作昨晚已經完成，而北跑道在打撈工作完成後已經重開，所以機場運作已經回復一切正常。

政府非常關注這宗事件，並與家屬一樣期望能早日找出事故原因，我們要求民航意外調查機構全速進行深入調查。

民航意外調查機構正進行全面調查，範圍包括機組人員的資格，飛行操作、飛機系統、維修紀錄和天氣等，會深入分析已經取回的兩個「黑盒」，了解意外經過。不同的海外專家亦會參與調查，確保調查專業、客觀、基於事實，預計一個月內可以發表初步調查報告。

但飛機事故的全面調查是複雜的，涉及飛機設計者、製造者、相關航空公司和人員，涵蓋不同國家和地方的專業、公司和人員。根據以往經驗，詳細的調查是需要時間，但我們已經要求民航意外調查機構盡速找出原因。政府會提供一切的資源支持調查機構盡快完成工作。

至於涉事飛機和機組人員，意外之後，涉事機組人員一直留在香港。土耳其當局承諾全力協調涉事航空公司和相關人員配合調查工作。同時，土耳其當局協助安排涉事航空公司代表上星期與家屬會面，公司向家屬表達慰問，並表示會提供恩恤金。

政府亦繼續調查事件，化驗後確認全部機組人員對酒精和驗毒化驗的檢測均為陰性。警方會進一步研究民航意外調查機構的調查，以判斷警方的調查方向。我們的目標是盡快完成調查工作，查找原因，除了防範事故再發生，如有任何人違法、違規，我們會依法追究。

有關公務員投票，我認為公務員是特區政府落實政策的重要成員，所以選出適合的立法會議員對於政府施政很重要，亦影響公務員的日常工作，因為立法會議員的意見、立法會議員如何行使其權力，以及日常如何與政府互相配合和互相制衡，這影響每個公務員的日常工作。因此公務員作為政府的重要成員，應該履行公民責任，以身作則投票。

我今日會發信予所有公務員，指出公務員有特別角色，作為政府的重要成員，亦是落實政府的政策，亦與立法會很多運作息息相關，應該以身作則，履行公民責任投票，亦應該推動整個香港熱烈搞活氣氛，以及推動香港市民重視和投入選舉工程。

記者：特首，你好。想請教兩方面問題，第一方面是關於基孔肯雅熱，現時本地個案增多，政府內部評估爆發風險高嗎？現時加強滅蚊是否已經足以處理這個有可能爆發的情況？可能在學校出現爆發時，因為見到有個案涉及一名學校職員，在學校出現一些疑似爆發，有多少宗個案就會有停課打算，有否這個指標？有沒有評估其他地區，是否都會有本地個案出現，政府如何應對？第二個問題想跟進貨機墮海事件，現時調查進度如何？「黑盒」已經找到，調查和取得「黑盒」內的資料，是否有結果和進度如何？到底是涉及機件故障，還是人為疏忽？有意見擔心機組人員萬一離開香港，追查會有難度，現行制度會如何規管？萬一真是涉及他們的問題，會如何追究責任？

行政長官：星期日錄得本地第一宗基孔肯雅熱的本地個案，而昨日亦新增三宗，包括兩宗輸入個案和一宗感染源頭有待確認的個案。基孔肯雅熱不是人傳人的病症，一般來說是會痊癒的，是經過蚊子叮咬感染者後，再叮咬其他人，令第二位人士可能受感染，所以不會人傳人，一般來說可以自行痊癒，死亡個案亦十分罕見。政府在這方面能管控及阻截蚊子的散播和傳染是重要的，所以首要任務是滅蚊，還要讓市民知道如何防範，減低受蚊叮後感染這個病症的風險。第一，一定要加強滅蚊和防蚊。環境及生態局昨日已經召開防治蟲鼠督導委員會，指導各部門在其範疇加強滅蚊、防蚊。環境及生態局局長昨日亦到黃大仙鳳德邨和附近一帶考察和指導滅蚊工作，而食物環境衞生署在患者居住附近250米範圍，特別是樹木茂盛的地方，進行密集式的霧化處理以殺蚊、滅蚊和清理積水。我亦特別留意學校、長者和幼兒設施，提醒和協助他們滅蚊，亦會巡查高風險地點，例如地盤，大家在這方面都要做好滅蚊、防蚊的工作。

另外，就是即時了解和跟進區內的居民健康情況，衞生防護中心和關愛隊已經聯絡當區的8 000戶居民進行問卷調查，中心已經在當區商場設立醫護站，為居民作評估，並舉辦教育講座。參加網上講座的人士非常熱烈，在網上觀看的人達4 000多人。事實上，政府一向有進行滅蚊工作。過去在二○一八年，曾經有登革熱傳染個案的上升數字，但因為政府和各界都努力滅蚊、防蚊以及清除積水和垃圾等，盡量減少蚊子的滋生機會，所以在二○一八年當登革熱個案上升時，成功打斷它的傳播鏈，從而控制當時情況。最重要是大家都要滅蚊、防蚊，還有保護自己，盡量減低感染風險，這方面政府會努力做，亦希望每個人都參與，令蚊患減到最少，防範這個疾病的傳染風險。基孔肯雅熱不是本土病，我們會全力滅蚊，確保不會在本地扎根。

另外，有關貨機墮海事件，我對在事件中，兩名保安人員不幸身故感到痛心，表示深切哀悼，亦向他們的家人致以深切慰問。我高度關注事件，已指示運輸及物流局全面統籌和迅速處理，特別是三方面的跟進：第一是全面、全速徹查事件，找出事故原因，如有違法、違規，必須追究責任；第二，全力協助家屬，助他們渡過難關；第三，確保一切運作符合國際民航安全標準，包括機場運作、基建、工作人員和乘客安全。運輸及物流局在意外發生後，即時迅速處理事件，包括跟土耳其當局會面，表達我們對事件的關注和受影響家屬的意願，協調涉事貨機的公司、不同機構與部門迅速應對和善後。打撈工作昨晚已經完成，而北跑道在打撈工作完成後已經重開，所以機場運作已經回復一切正常。

政府非常關注這宗事件，並與家屬一樣期望能早日找出事故原因，我們要求民航意外調查機構全速進行深入調查。

民航意外調查機構正進行全面調查，範圍包括機組人員的資格，飛行操作、飛機系統、維修紀錄和天氣等，會深入分析已經取回的兩個「黑盒」，了解意外經過。不同的海外專家亦會參與調查，確保調查專業、客觀、基於事實，預計一個月內可以發表初步調查報告。

但飛機事故的全面調查是複雜的，涉及飛機設計者、製造者、相關航空公司和人員，涵蓋不同國家和地方的專業、公司和人員。根據以往經驗，詳細的調查是需要時間，但我們已經要求民航意外調查機構盡速找出原因。政府會提供一切的資源支持調查機構盡快完成工作。

至於涉事飛機和機組人員，意外之後，涉事機組人員一直留在香港。土耳其當局承諾全力協調涉事航空公司和相關人員配合調查工作。同時，土耳其當局協助安排涉事航空公司代表上星期與家屬會面，公司向家屬表達慰問，並表示會提供恩恤金。

政府亦繼續調查事件，化驗後確認全部機組人員對酒精和驗毒化驗的檢測均為陰性。警方會進一步研究民航意外調查機構的調查，以判斷警方的調查方向。我們的目標是盡快完成調查工作，查找原因，除了防範事故再發生，如有任何人違法、違規，我們會依法追究。

Remarks by CE at media session before ExCo (with video),2025-10-28 13:50,2025-10-28 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800387.htm,"  Following are the remarks by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at a media session before the Executive Council meeting today (October 28):

Reporter: Good morning, Chief Executive. First, how do you see the LegCo (Legislative Council) breaking from tradition to call off the farewell motion and banquet and its implication on the future executive-legislative relationship? You mentioned the LegCo election (Legislative Council General Election). Do you expect a higher turnout rate than in 2021, following the Government's efforts to encourage residents to vote? And there are reports that the Government sent officials to Macao to study its experience with mobilisation for the LegCo election. What are the key takeaways for the visit? And second for the cargo plane crash last week. How would the Government do to ensure that the authorities can hold all relevant parties accountable and ensure the crew members stay in Hong Kong throughout the entire investigation process? Thank you.

Chief Executive: Legislative Council Members discussed among themselves to make arrangements to suit their best interest and also to accommodate their busy work. I respect that decision. I also fully appreciate why they made a decision about what they would do, and did it. The upcoming Legislative Council General Election is a very important election. It affects everybody because the Government's policies implementation will mostly have to go through LegCo through enacting laws or through LegCo funding. So it is important to ensure that we have the most appropriate LegCo Members serving the interests of Hong Kong. It affects everybody, and it is a civic responsibility for voters to vote. It is also a civic responsibility for everybody to promote the election so that such a significant event will take its course smoothly and attract the most attention and support from everybody.

  The nomination period for the 2025 Legislative Council General Election began last Friday and so far, up to yesterday, already 50 candidates have reported their intention to run for the election. It will be a fierce competition, and candidates will have to compete by their election platforms, capabilities and performances, but it will be a healthy competition. The Chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission has already made an appeal for everybody to take part in the election and cast their vote, and has also appealed to organisations and businesses to encourage their employees to vote and also to facilitate their employees when they have to vote during their day of work. The Government will do the same. The Government will, first of all, respond to the appeal by the Chairman, and I'll be writing to all civil servants to encourage them to act as an example, to exercise their civic responsibility to vote. It affects their daily work as well, because we work very closely with the Legislative Council on a daily basis. It is an important election and the whole Government will do our best to promote it, and appeal to everybody in society to do the same to promote it. It is an important duty for the Government. This is also a matter of great significance for everybody to participate in, to encourage others to take part. So it is a collective effort of Hong Kong, and the aim is to do it well in all aspects.

  So the goal we set for ourselves is: do our best in all elements of the election, and we'll do our best to achieve that goal. We try to make this a successful election. That is why we look to the good practices of all places beyond us. In particular, Macao has recently done a very successful election, and we have been in good exchange with our colleagues in the Macao Special Administrative Region Government and what we are doing, in fact, reinforces the good experiences that we learnt from our Macao counterparts and also different parts of the world. In other words, we have to raise people's awareness, interest and understanding of the significance of the election, and then we'll do a full-scale mobilisation of not just the Government, but the whole of Hong Kong. We'll appeal to everybody to exercise our civic responsibility, appeal to everybody to vote, and appeal to organisations and businesses to encourage their staff to vote. It is a whole-city campaign. The candidates have to work well, and they will have to do their best, and they will have to display to the community, to their voters, that they are the appropriate candidates who should be elected to become a LegCo Member. So the candidates will have to work hard, the Government will work hard, and all of society should join forces to make sure this is a good success. We'll make that aim our efforts in the run-up to December 7.

  In respect of the incident in which a cargo plane ran into the sea, causing two deaths, I am deeply saddened by the passing away of the two security officers in the incident. I extend my deepest condolences, and express my profound sympathy to the families. I'm highly concerned about the incident and have instructed the Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB) to co-ordinate and take expedited action. First, we will conduct a thorough and immediate investigation to find out the cause of the incident. If there are violations of the laws or regulations, we shall hold the responsible persons accountable. Second, provide full assistance to the families to help them go through the difficult time. And third, ensure all operations comply with international civil aviation safety standards, including airport operations, infrastructure and the safety of staff and passengers.

  The TLB has been handling the incident fast, and they have immediately met with the Turkish authorities to convey our concerns about the incident and the wishes of the affected families, and co-ordinated with the cargo airline company, and various organisations and departments for quick response and follow-up management. The salvage work was completed last night, and the North Runway has reopened, and now the airport is running as usual. The Government is very concerned about the incident, and we share the family's hope to identify the cause of the accident as soon as possible. We have asked the Air Accident Investigation Authority to conduct an in-depth investigation expeditiously. The Authority is now conducting a comprehensive investigation with the scope covering areas such as crew qualifications, flight operations, aircraft systems, maintenance records and the weather. It will conduct an in-depth analysis of the two retrieved ""black boxes"" to find out the sequence of the event. Overseas experts will also participate to ensure a professional, objective and fact-based investigation. A preliminary investigation report is expected to be issued within a month.

  Aircraft accident investigations are complex investigations involving aircraft designers, manufacturers, the relevant airlines and personnel, encompassing expertise, companies and individuals from different countries or regions. Based on past experience, the full investigation will take time, but I have already asked the Air Accident Investigation Authority to ascertain the cause of the incident as quickly as possible. The Government will provide sufficient resources, and all departments will offer their full support. The Police will continue their investigation. Laboratory tests confirmed that all crew members tested negative for alcohol and drugs. The Police will further study the findings of the Air Accident Investigation Authority’s inquiry to determine the direction of the police investigation.

  Regarding the aircraft and crew involved, the crew members involved have been staying in Hong Kong since the incident. The Turkish authorities have pledged their commitments to co-ordinate with the cargo airline company and relevant personnel to co-operate with the related work and the investigation. Concurrently, the Turkish authorities have assisted in arranging for representatives of the involved airline company to meet with the affected families last Friday. The company expressed condolences to the families and indicated an ex gratia relief payment will be provided. We'll do our best to assist in the investigation, and our aim is to finish it as expeditiously as possible. Thank you.

運輸及物流局局長出席香港貨品編碼協會高峰會2025致辭,2025-10-28 12:52,2025-10-28 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800334.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（十月二十八日）出席香港貨品編碼協會高峰會2025的致辭全文：

Roy（香港貨品編碼協會董事局主席伍俊達）、周部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室經濟部副部長兼貿易處負責人周強）、Frankie（立法會議員易志明）、Peter（立法會議員邵家輝）、Anna（香港貨品編碼協會總裁林潔貽）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

  Good morning. While the weather is a bit cold, once I stepped into this room, I could feel the warmth and vibrancy from the participants today. I look forward to a very energetic and dynamic gathering and discussion later this morning. It really gives me great pleasure to join you today for this year's GS1 Hong Kong Summit. May I also extend my warm welcome to our visitors from around the globe: welcome to Hong Kong.

  I think you will all agree that the past year was a tumultuous one when it comes to trade and logistics. Trade and logistics are two very important subjects dear to my bureau as the name is Transport and Logistics Bureau. Anna always tells me that the GS1 Summit is not about logistics, it is about an even higher and more strategic topic, it is about global standard-setting, and the Summit has a very important DNA and element that cut across different trades. From the so-called reciprocal tariffs to the tug and pull in Sino-American relations, global trade is now sailing in increasingly choppy waters. US (United States) tariff rates are impossible to keep track of, especially for this part of the world, and what seems like a truce in the trade war between the US and our country can evaporate through just a news thread on social media. You can see how dynamic and how unpredictable it is.

  Adding to this complexity is the new regulatory environment we find ourselves in, as Chairman Roy has just mentioned. The evolvement of environment, social and governance, or ESG in short, is exciting, as businesses take steps to protect our Mother Earth and assume more social responsibilities in their business practices to make our world greener, more sustainable and equitable. From this year onwards, the European Union has taken the lead in making reporting scope 3 emissions mandatory for large companies in the Union, which have great implications for their business partners in Hong Kong as well. However, we need to be honest that putting ESG into practice is not without challenges, not least in terms of cost. The current global economic climate makes it even more testing, especially for SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises).
  
  On a more optimistic score, technologies are changing the world beyond our wild imagination and are certainly making trade and logistics more efficient than ever before. AI algorithms now power online retail and trading platforms, as well as logistics data systems that help to weave the previously fragmented world of trade together. Cryptocurrency, once an outcast of traditional business, is gradually making its presence felt in the form of regulated stablecoin. Automation and robotics gradually take shapes, they are all staples in many warehouses, which often operate without lights. Do you know why? Because they operate without human beings and are not staffed by them but robotics. All these developments translate into new opportunities for our logistics trade that are up for grabs if you invest and up your game.

  Of course, from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government's point of view, apart from AI, automation, robotics, my bureau is also championing a new venture area of low-altitude economy. I have recently had some discussions with participants and stakeholders in the industry. While we have also been mindful of the concerns and sentiments of the trade, especially SMEs, on this new innovative area, I am also encouraged by the optimism, dedication and the forward-looking visionary strategic mindset demonstrated by a number of industry leaders. We should actually push forward innovative ideas like low-altitude economy, which can help our logistics trade to crossover with other areas, and that could also open up new market potentials for our industry and sectors.

  Against this backdrop, the discussion at GS1 Hong Kong Summit today cannot be timelier. Indeed, to be able to do what the theme of the Summit today suggests: sustainability, transformation, AI and resilience, which are nicely acronymised as ""STAR"", will make you a star in this brave, new world. And we in the HKSAR Government have been one step ahead in facilitating such STAR development and transformation through various measures that we have committed to delivering in the Action Plan on Modern Logistics Development promulgated two years ago.

Sustainability

  In terms of S - Sustainability, we published the Roadmap for ESG Development for Logistics Industry in June this year, providing an easy-to-follow guideline for logistics SMEs to take their steps forward to build up their capabilities to collect and report ESG data, thereby meeting the prevailing international ESG requirements and guidelines. The Roadmap is backed up by financial support from the Government for the logistics trade in the form of funding schemes to encourage practitioners for attending relevant trainings or acquiring ESG solutions. I do encourage some of the industry leaders today to share your ESG solutions amongst the trade so as to promote the awareness within the trade. We also launched a one-stop platform, which is an online portal called ESG resource centre, where logistics companies can obtain up-to-date information on the relevant regulations, governmental support and in particular, international news and practices related to ESG. I do hope that with our soon-to-be-released easy-to-use ESG data collection toolkit, we can see more SMEs joining us on this pathway towards an ESG development strategy.

Transformation and AI

  On transformation and AI, I think we cannot avoid this subject in every of our seminars and discussion forums nowadays. The Government is also spearheading the adoption of AI in logistics through the Port Community System (PCS) in which Chairman Roy just mentioned, thank you very much for highlighting this. This is actually one of our signature projects to be launched very soon. With this data platform that is built on cutting-edge technologies as AI, blockchain and cloud computing, the PCS will offer a round-the-clock, real-time cargo tracking service to the port and logistics industry. Not to mention the basics in data collection and technology, two things impressed me most. In our journey towards the formulation of this Port Community System, I can see how our industry sectors are united in pushing the Government and guiding us through in order to make this happen. I already see different entities and cities in our neighbouring provinces like the GBA (Greater Bay Area) waving their hands to us, noting this PCS is going to launch. They are all very active, prepared and eager to join us in order to share data and to see how the customs clearance on both sides can be further streamlined to help our SMEs and other enterprises to make our logistics and trade operation even more efficient. Another point to be mentioned is our collaboration and crossover with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under the Project Cargoˣ. This is one of the encouraging areas in which we can also earn the support of our established banks in Hong Kong so as to help our SMEs on trade finance as well.

Resilience

  Resilience is the number one keyword for us now in order to face different challenges. Building resilience has always been a key development direction that we advocate for the logistics industry. With the uncertain geopolitical landscape and the rapid transformation of trade pattern, market diversification and stepping up collaboration with the Chinese Mainland have become ever more popular and important.

  我們與周強部長雙方合作，提供一個平台讓香港和內地的企業可以合作，簽訂一些協議，範疇包括推動綠色港口及綠色船用燃料加注。我有信心這個平台可以讓我們在物流和其他貿易範疇扮演示範作用，亦可幫助企業加深兩方面的合作，促進共同發展。
  ​
  In this connection, my bureau has also been leading Hong Kong's logistics enterprises to cope with the challenges brought by the new trade landscape by exploring emerging markets and new market opportunities. In particular, we have been conducting promotional visits to ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), the Middle East and Belt and Road countries. We also have been extending our cargo hinterland in the Mainland through establishing a ""rail-sea-land-river"",「鐵海陸江」立體多式聯運系統. With Anna, Frankie and a number of friends here today, we have made excursions to different parts of Chinese Mainland hinterland, including Chengdu, Chongqing and Guangxi. All these are very strategic and important growing cities in which we can establish our footing there and provide our robust and extensive air and sea cargo destinations network to serve the hinterland. Looking ahead, we will also be introducing a very important piece of legislative amendment early next year, that is to provide exemption for import and export license requirements for certain transshipment cargos to make Hong Kong even more attractive as a transshipment hub.

Concluding remarks

  Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong's road to prosperity was marked with ups and downs, but our resilience put us among the very best in the world in terms of logistics. I am totally confident that with this in our arsenal, we will emerge from the current storm stronger than ever before. What is equally crucial is that the Government and the industry will stand in solidarity to counter adversity. On this note, I thank GS1 Hong Kong for organising this summit, through which I am sure you will all have valuable takeaways on how to integrate STAR into your business and seize new opportunities. Last but not least, let us have ""when the going gets tough, the tough get going"" as our motto and build Hong Kong into an international logistics hub stronger than ever before.

  Lastly, I would like to use a few minutes from the Summit, if the Chairman permits, to make a strong appeal to you, which is common and important to every citizen of Hong Kong here. A strong and collaborative relationship between the Administration and Legislature is essential for Hong Kong's continued prosperity and stability. Ladies and gentlemen, I urge all of you, Hong Kong citizens here, to fulfil your civic duty on the election day of December 7 by casting your sacred vote for the future development of Hong Kong.

​  各位，「行政立法同心治港、共築改善自身的局面」是全港市民的共同願景，亦是特區未來持續發展和經濟繁榮的一個重要基石。接下來，我很希望各位香港市民能積極投入選舉，共創未來，在十二月七日投下你們神聖的一票，為我們選出賢能，繼續在行政、立法兩方面有互動良好發展，為香港經濟、物流持續推進有關發展。多謝大家。"

We also have been extending our cargo hinterland in the Mainland through establishing a ""rail-sea-land-river"",ãéµæµ·é¸æ±ãç«é«å¤å¼è¯éç³»çµ±. With Anna, Frankie and a number of friends here today, we have made excursions to different parts of Chinese Mainland hinterland, including Chengdu, Chongqing and Guangxi. All these are very strategic and important growing cities in which we can establish our footing there and provide our robust and extensive air and sea cargo destinations network to serve the hinterland. Looking ahead, we will also be introducing a very important piece of legislative amendment early next year, that is to provide exemption for import and export license requirements for certain transshipment cargos to make Hong Kong even more attractive as a transshipment hub.

Concluding remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong's road to prosperity was marked with ups and downs, but our resilience put us among the very best in the world in terms of logistics. I am totally confident that with this in our arsenal, we will emerge from the current storm stronger than ever before. What is equally crucial is that the Government and the industry will stand in solidarity to counter adversity. On this note, I thank GS1 Hong Kong for organising this summit, through which I am sure you will all have valuable takeaways on how to integrate STAR into your business and seize new opportunities. Last but not least, let us have ""when the going gets tough, the tough get going"" as our motto and build Hong Kong into an international logistics hub stronger than ever before.

Lastly, I would like to use a few minutes from the Summit, if the Chairman permits, to make a strong appeal to you, which is common and important to every citizen of Hong Kong here. A strong and collaborative relationship between the Administration and Legislature is essential for Hong Kong's continued prosperity and stability. Ladies and gentlemen, I urge all of you, Hong Kong citizens here, to fulfil your civic duty on the election day of December 7 by casting your sacred vote for the future development of Hong Kong.

《行政長官2025年施政報告》強調會加快發展及落實北部都會區。隨着北部都會區各個發展項目包括新田科技城、洪水橋／厦村新發展區、元朗南新發展區及牛潭尾新發展區等相繼展開，預計牛潭尾濾水廠原有濾水量於二○三一年將不足以應付新增的用水需求。為滿足將來的用水需求，該兩項工程合約會擴展牛潭尾濾水廠，將該廠每日濾水量由23萬立方米增至44萬立方米，並且預留備用空間，以便日後可進一步提升該廠的濾水量。

擴建後的牛潭尾濾水廠將應用嶄新的濾水技術，例如採用紫外線殺滅99.99%病原體和病毒以提升食水水質，亦會採用溶氣浮選法取代現有的多層式沉澱淨水過程，從而減少佔用土地面積。此外，濾水廠的運作會採用數碼孿生模型及加入智慧元素，冀能節省人力、用電及消耗品，提高運作效率，並降低運作成本。

水務署亦會在北都供水管網推行智慧水務策略，為管網建立數碼孿生模型進行實時監測及情景分析，並結合人工智能等技術進行預測性維修，同時通過實施動態減壓保護管網健康。為全力配合北都發展，特別是創科發展的工業用水及大量冷卻用水需求，水務署現正進行多元化的水資源規劃，包括控制食水需求增長，如積極鼓勵企業採用節水技術、採用再造水作非飲用用途，如工業及冷卻水用途，以提供穩定且經濟的水源。

WSD signs contracts for Ngau Tam Mei Water Treatment Works extension to dovetail with development of Northern Metropolis (with photos),2025-10-28 12:30,2025-10-28 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102700419.htm,"The Water Supplies Department (WSD) today (October 28) signed two contracts with joint ventures formed by China Road and Bridge Corporation and China National Chemical Engineering Group Corporation Limited; and Chun Wo Construction and Engineering Company Limited and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation respectively to implement package one of the main works of the Ngau Tam Mei Water Treatment Works (NTMWTW) extension. The total value of the two contracts is about HK$7.978 billion. The works commence today and are targeted to complete in about five and a half years.

The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address emphasises the acceleration of the development of the Northern Metropolis. Subsequent to the launching of various development proposals in the Northern Metropolis including San Tin Technopole, Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen New Development Area, Yuen Long South New Development Area, Ngau Tam Mei New Development Area, etc., it is anticipated that the existing NTMWTW will not be able to cope with the increase in water demand by 2031. Under the two works contracts, the water treatment capacity of the NTMWTW will be increased from 230 000 cubic metres per day to 440 000 cubic metres per day so as to cope with the future water demand. Spare space has been reserved for possible further increases of water treatment capacity in the future.

Advanced water treatment technologies will be applied in the expanded NTMWTW, such as use of ultra-violet light to kill 99.99 per cent of pathogens and viruses to enhance drinking water quality, and replacement of the existing multi-deck sedimentation with dissolved air flotation for water treatment to minimise the required footprint. In addition, the operation of the NTMWTW will embrace digital twins and smart elements with a view to saving manpower, electricity and consumables so as to enhance operational efficiency and reduce operating costs.

The WSD will implement smart water strategies for the water supply networks of the Northern Metropolis through the establishment of digital twins for real-time monitoring and scenario simulation, and work together with technologies such as AI for predictive maintenance and dynamic pressure reduction to maintain the health of the water supply networks.

To fully dovetail with the development of the Northern Metropolis, especially the industrial and cooling water demands driven by innovation and technology, the WSD is implementing diversified water resources planning. This includes controlling the potable water demand growth by actively encouraging enterprises to adopt water-saving technologies and to use reclaimed water for non-potable purposes, such as industrial or cooling uses. These efforts aim to provide a stable and cost-effective water supply.

The Director of Water Supplies, Mr Roger Wong, today signed the contracts respectively with representatives of the two joint ventures mentioned above."

SFST's speech at AIMA APAC Annual Forum 2025 (English only),2025-10-28 10:42,2025-10-28 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800225.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) Asia-Pacific (APAC) Annual Forum 2025 today (October 28):

Jack (Chief Executive Officer of the AIMA, Mr Jack Inglis), Michael (Managing Director and Co-head of APAC, AIMA, Mr Michael Bugel), Kher Sheng (Managing Director and Co-head of APAC, AIMA, Mr Lee Kher-sheng), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  It is a great honour to address you today at the AIMA APAC Annual Forum 2025, here in the vibrant heart of Hong Kong. I am delighted to join over 600 senior leaders from the alternative investment sector — pioneers who shape the future of global finance. AIMA, as the preeminent voice for our industry across more than 60 locations, plays an indispensable role in advocating for innovation, sound governance and sustainable growth. This forum is a testament to our shared commitment to navigating the complexities of today's markets, and I thank you for the opportunity to contribute to these vital discussions.

  Let us begin by reflecting on the dynamic landscape of the global alternative investment sector. This year has underscored a profound resilience and appetite for alternatives amid persistent market uncertainties. Institutional allocators, in particular, demonstrate unwavering confidence: AIMA's research indicates 46 per cent plan to increase their hedge fund allocations over the coming year, drawn to strategies that deliver uncorrelated returns, capital efficiency, and also tailored customisation. Record inflows continue to surge into non-traditional equity, private credit, and digital assets, validating alternatives as a cornerstone of diversified portfolios. Private credit and private equity, in particular, remain firmly at the very core of institutional strategies, bolstered by robust deal activity and also steady capital deployment — especially in high-growth regions like the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, where structural reforms are unlocking long-term capital flows.

  Also, technology and innovation are no longer peripheral but central to our evolution. AIMA's latest findings reveal that 58 per cent of managers now anticipate ramping up generative AI integration in their investment processes — a sharp rise from 2023 — while investors more commonly incorporate AI-specific due diligence into their assessments. Cybersecurity and digital assets have similarly transitioned to mainstream imperatives, enabling enhanced risk management and new investment opportunities.

  Regulatory and governance imperatives further define this era, with global policy forums — many convened by AIMA — emphasising adaptive frameworks and industry-led standards, particularly for private market strategies. Geopolitical tensions, once viewed solely as hazards and risks, are increasingly reframed as alpha opportunities, necessitating dynamic hedging and robust risk budgeting as prerequisites for outperformance. These trends, as AIMA aptly captures, affirm the sector's vitality: robust institutional demand and record fundraising cement alternatives' pivotal role, while emerging opportunities in AI, private credit, and policy evolution call for agility and ceaseless innovation.

  Hong Kong stands at the very epicentre of this global momentum, uniquely positioned under the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle to bridge international capital with Asia's inexhaustible opportunities. Our city is not merely a participant in these trends but an accelerator, leveraging our highly open, internationalised market as seen in today’s audience; our robust rule of law; and our regulatory alignment with leading global jurisdictions. With assets under management surpassing HK$35 trillion — 11 times our GDP — and net fund inflows reaching HK$705 billion last year alone, followed by HK$340 billion in the first eight months of this year, Hong Kong reaffirms its stature as Asia's foremost hub for alternative investments. Home to over 650 private equity firms managing nearly US$228 billion and more than 2,700 single family offices, we are Asia's largest cross-boundary wealth management centre, with projections positioning us to claim global primacy in the coming years.

  In alignment with the trends AIMA has identified, the Hong Kong Government is advancing a comprehensive policy agenda to nurture this ecosystem. Central to our efforts is the enhancement of our preferential tax regimes for funds, single family offices, and carried interest — measures designed to attract and retain the institutional capital that fuels private equity and credit strategies. Under our existing framework, publicly offered funds are already exempt from profits tax, while a targeted ordinance has provided tax relief for carried interest distributed by eligible private equity funds since May 2021.

  Building on this foundation, we are finalising proposals this year to broaden these concessions further. These include expanding the scope of qualifying transactions to encompass emissions derivatives, carbon credits, insurance-linked securities, loans, private credit investments, and digital assets; refining the carried interest regime by removing the regulator's certification requirement and the hurdle rate reference; and extending exemptions to pension and endowment funds. We target submission of the legislative bill to the Legislative Council in the first half of next year, with implementation from the year of assessment 2025/26. These reforms directly respond to the sector's call for capital efficiency and customisation, enabling managers to deploy resources more effectively while mitigating fiscal barriers to innovation in Asia-Pacific's growth corridors.

  Equally pivotal is our drive to facilitate the listing of alternative asset funds, fostering deeper liquidity and investor access in line with the rising demand for resilient strategies. In February this year, our regulator issued a circular clarifying regulatory requirements for closed-ended funds investing primarily in private and less liquid assets — such as private equity, private credit, and infrastructure, to list here in Hong Kong. This guidance emphasises management competence, diversified portfolios, robust distribution policies, rigorous valuation standards and comprehensive disclosures, while allowing flexibility to suit diverse strategies. Preferentially, we encourage sizeable funds with regular income streams, and the regulator may impose additional conditions, modify requirements or allow flexibility in compliance with certain requirements, having regard to the fund's nature and investment strategy. Complementing this, the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority clarified in May this year that MPF funds may invest in approved listed private equity funds, capped at 10 per cent of net asset value to balance diversification benefits with risk safeguards. This opens new channels for institutional inflows, supporting the record fundraising and private market vitality that AIMA just highlighted.

  To amplify our appeal to single family offices and global wealth owners — the nimble stewards of bespoke, long-term capital — we launched the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme in March last year, enriching our pool of wealth owners and injecting fresh allocators into the alternatives space. Our third Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit in March this year also convened global family offices, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange. These initiatives, coupled with tax concessions for single family offices and a dedicated FamilyOfficeHK team in our Invest Hong Kong which is the investment promotion agency in the Government, position Hong Kong as a sanctuary for the transparency and governance that allocators now demand. Moreover, our ongoing diversification of fund structures — through the Open-ended Fund Company and Limited Partnership Fund regimes, alongside re-domiciliation mechanisms — facilitates seamless migration and innovation, aligning with the sector's embrace of technology and regional divergence.

  Ladies and gentlemen, these policies are not isolated measures but a cohesive strategy to propel Hong Kong's alternatives sector forward, in harmony with global currents. By deepening mutual market access with the Mainland — through enhancements to Stock Connect, Bond Connect, and the Mutual Recognition of Funds arrangement — we are channelling Asia's structural tailwinds into tangible opportunities for hedge funds, private equity, and beyond. As we explore innovative offerings like offshore Mainland government bond futures and inclusion of RMB counters in Southbound Stock Connect, we reinforce Hong Kong's role as the indispensable gateway for risk-managed growth.

  In closing, the trends before us demand partnership, and Hong Kong is resolute in our collaboration with AIMA and our shared community. Together, we will harness institutional appetite, pioneer technological frontiers and fortify governance to unlock the full promise of alternatives. I very much look forward to the dialogues ahead and to Hong Kong's continued leadership in this sector. Thank you."

As a result, they instituted a prosecution and issued a statutory notice to the relevant property management company in accordance with Section 27 of the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132), requiring the company's responsible person to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds. The FEHD also inspected nearby construction sites and found mosquito breeding and stagnant water, and hence instituted a prosecution and issued four statutory notices to the relevant contractors.

In addition, the FEHD has inspected schools, elderly homes, and childcare facilities in the surrounding area and has installed new mosquito traps in the relevant schools to further strengthen mosquito prevention and control.

Mr Tse said the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures. The Environment and Ecology Bureau convened the interdepartmental Pest Control Steering Committee special meeting to advise relevant departments to strengthen anti-mosquito measures in the areas under their purviews. The district offices of the FEHD will also hold interdepartmental meetings at the district level to undergo risk assessment and conduct targeted measures.

He appealed to members of the public to fully support and co-operate with the Government's work, including seeking medical advice or contacting the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health if they had a fever, rash or joint pain. Members of the public should also inspect their homes; property management personnel should also inspect public areas within buildings and housing estates, such as flower beds, refuse rooms, and rooftops, to thoroughly eliminate stagnant water, preventing mosquito breeding.

While attending a continuing professional development seminar held by the Property Management Services Authority today, Mr Ng called on the industry to work hand in hand with the Government to enhance mosquito prevention and control measures within their managed properties."

15th National Games torch relay to be held on November 2 (with photos/video),2025-10-27 22:40,2025-10-27 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700706.htm,"  To welcome the official opening of the 15th National Games (NG) on November 9, the 15th NG torch relay will be held simultaneously in four cities, namely Hong Kong, Macao, Guangzhou and Shenzhen on November 2. There will be a total of 200 torchbearers, with 50 torchbearers in each city. The torch relay launching ceremony will be held at 9am that day in Shenzhen, followed by starting ceremonies in Hong Kong, Macao and Guangzhou at 9.30am, where torch relay will start simultaneously. Representatives of the four cities will return the flame to Guangzhou after the torch relay. A flame-gathering ceremony will be held at around 5pm in the Guangdong Olympic Sports Center, bridging the torch relay at the venue and the lighting of the main torch at the 15th NG opening ceremony.

 The Head of the National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong), Mr Yeung Tak-keung, together with representatives from the Hong Kong Police Force and the Transport Department, held an interdepartmental press conference today (October 27) to give briefing on the route of torch relay in Hong Kong and the relevant transportation arrangements.

 Torch relay in Hong Kong will start at 9.30am on November 2. The total route length is approximately 10 kilometers, divided into five segments, with the running distance accounting for about 3.8 kilometers. Starting from the Central Government Offices in Tamar,the Hong Kong route passes through the Central and Western District Promenade (Central Section), the Wan Chai Temporary Promenade, the Monument in Commemoration of Return of Hong Kong to China and Golden Bauhinia Square. For the second section, torchbearers will cross the Victoria Harbour by Star Ferry and take part along the Tsim Sha Tsui route. They will start from Star Ferry Bus Terminus in Tsim Sha Tsui in Salisbury Road to Mody Lane, passing by the Hong Kong Cultural Centre and Hong Kong Museum of Art. Torchbearers of the fourth section will take an open-top bus to the bus terminal at the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP). After entering KTSP, the torchbearers of the fifth section will pass by the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground and the Kai Tak Sports Avenue before arriving at the Kai Tak Sports Park Central Square. The last torchbearer will then light the cauldron and the closing ceremony will take place.

 To facilitate the holding of the torch relay, road sections of the Central and Western District Promenade (Central Section), Golden Bauhinia Square and Wan Chai Temporary Promenade will be temporarily closed during the event. Moreover, special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented by the Police and Transport Department during the event.

Road traffic control measures

During the torch relay, road closures and special traffic arrangements will be implemented in the areas of Wan Chai North, the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront, and around the Kai Tak Sports Park. All affected roads will be reopened in due course after the torch relay has passed through.The affected areas include:

(1) Wan Chai North
- Section of Expo Drive East outside Golden Bauhinia Square will be closed from 8am.
- Expo Drive, the slip road leading from Central - Wan Chai Bypass Tunnel eastbound to Expo Drive, and Expo Drive East will be closed from 9am.
- Roads near Lung Wo Road and Hung Hing Road will be intermittently closed.

(2) Area around Tsim Sha Tsui Waterfront
- Salisbury Road, Canton Road, Kowloon Park Drive, Hankow Road, Nathan Road, Middle Road, Chatham Road South, Hong Wan Path, Mody Lane, and Hung Hom Bypass etc, will be closed from 8.30am.
- Hong Chong Road, Chatham Road North, and the East Kowloon Corridor will be intermittently closed.

(3) Area around Kai Tak Sports Park
- The pick-up/drop-off area next to the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground on Sung Wong Toi Road will be closed from 8am.
- East Kowloon Corridor, Kowloon City Road, and Sung Wong Toi Road will be intermittently closed.

Restricted Flying Zone

 The Police will set up a temporary restricted flying zone (RFZ), extending two kilometres outwards from the route of the torch relay from 8.30am to 11.40am on November 2. No small unmanned aircraft, except those authorised, will be permitted to enter the zone. Details of the temporary RFZ will be shown on the electronic portal for small unmanned aircraft ""eSUA"".

Public transport arrangements

 To facilitate the temporary road closures and traffic control measures to be implemented by the Police at Wan Chai North and Tsim Sha Tsui on the morning of the Hong Kong leg of the 15th National Games torch relay, 52 franchised bus routes and five green minibus (GMB) routes operating in the affected road sections in the vicinity of Expo Drive East in Wan Chai, Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier Bus Terminus, Nathan Road and Salisbury Road will adjust their services starting from the first departure on that day. Among them, KMB Route No. 8P (Laguna Verde – Tsim Sha Tsui (Circular)) will be suspended. The remaining affected bus and GMB routes will require temporary diversion or suspension/relocation of relevant stops within the affected areas. Normal operations will resume gradually after roads reopen. Relevant public transport operators will issue notices to inform affected passengers of the service adjustment details.

 According to the route of the torch relay, the torch will be passed to the Kai Tak Sports Park via ferry and an open-top bus, with temporary control measures along the route. Subject to the actual situation, there may be temporary service adjustment from around 9.45am to 10.30am in the Wan Chai – Tsim Sha Tsui ferry route. In addition, the overall traffic at Wan Chai North, West Kowloon and East Kowloon will be busier. The Transport Department urges members of the public and visitors travelling to the affected areas to plan their trips in advance and allow sufficient time for their journeys. They are advised to use railway services as far as possible and avoid driving to the affected road sections.

ããMr Yeung said, the entire Hong Kong relay route is designed to highlight the unique cultural and sporting characteristics of the city. The torchbearers include representatives from various sectors, including sports, sponsors, volunteers, the youth, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities. The detailed list of torchbearers will be announced in due course. Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao cohosted a press conference in Guangzhou this morning. Mr Yeung addressed in the press conference that the biggest highlight of the 15th NG torch relay is the collaborative progress of the three places and the relay among the four cities. The unique feature of the joint hosting of the 15th NG by the three places has been fully demonstrated, from the lighting of the ""source flame"" in Nansha, Guangzhou by the representatives of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau earlier this month to the simultaneous torch relay events in four locations on November 2."
Update on chikungunya fever (with photos),2025-10-27 22:17,2025-10-27 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700766.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 27), the CHP has recorded three new cases of chikungunya fever (CF). The CHP continued to implement various prevention and control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

Latest cases information
------------------------------
ãã The first case involves a 55-year-old female living in Wong Tai Sin. Following the first local case yesterday (October 26), the CHP conducted active case finding and noted that she is a staff of a school at Fung Tak Estate. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Shanwei in Guangdong between October 11 and 12. Several days after returning to Hong Kong, she visited Shenzhen in Guangdong alone on October 19. She developed a fever, rash and joint pain on October 24. She sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital yesterday evening. The CHP immediately arranged the patient for testing upon receiving notification. Her travel companions to Shanwei and three household contacts are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance. Since the patient stayed at two affected places (including Shenzhen and the vicinity of Fung Tak Estate), her source of infection has yet to be confirmed. The CHP will carry out genome analysis to ascertain whether it has epidemiological linkage with the confirmed local case yesterday. Investigation is ongoing.

The second case involves a 67-year-old male living in Tung Chung. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Foshan in Guangdong alone between September 29 and October 24. He developed a fever and joint pain on October 23. He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of North Lantau Hospital the following day upon returning Hong Kong. He has three household contacts who are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

ããThe third case involves a 76-year-old female living in Tseung Kwan O. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Guangzhou and Huizhou in Guangdong alone between October 17 and 26. She developed a fever and joint pain on October 22 and sought medical attention at a hospital in Guangdong. She returned to Hong Kong on October 26 and sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Tseung Kwan O Hospital. She has two household contacts who are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

ãã All three patients were admitted to the hospitals for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and are in stable condition. Their blood samples tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. Since the abovementioned 67-year-old male and 76-year-old female stayed in Guangdong Province during their incubation period, the CHP considered that they were infected during travel. The cases were classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigations are ongoing, and it has reported the cases to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Government's comprehensive actions on prevention and control of CF
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ãã The CHP is implementing prevention and control measures according to epidemiological investigations and risk assessment, including providing medical surveillance and health advice to household contacts of the case or those with common exposure to the source of infection. If they present with relevant symptoms, the CHP will arrange for laboratory testing. The CHP officers and District Services & Community Care Teams (Care Teams) have distributed questionnaires and promotional leaflets to about 8 000 households in the district, and will continue to contact the residents, disseminate information, and understand and follow up their health conditions. The CHP has also issued letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and remaining them to be vigilant.
ãã ã

ãã The CHP and Wong Tai Sin District Office (WTSDO) organised a public health talk at the at Fung Tak Estate Community Centre at 8pm tonight to enhance public understanding of this mosquito-borne disease and encourage active participation in prevention efforts to protect both oneself and others. Besides, the online seminar held by the CHP last night attracted over 4 100 total views.

ãã In addition, the CHP has set up an inquiry hotline (2125 2373) and a health consultation booth at 2/F, Fung Tak Shopping Centre from yesterday, where assessments have been provided to residents with relevant symptoms. As at 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessment for about 1 300 residents, with seven individuals presenting relevant symptoms received blood tests. While awaiting laboratory results, they will follow the CHP's advice to use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients for effective prevention of mosquito bites. The hotline and health consultation booth will continue to operate from 9am to 8pm daily.

ãã The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year. In fact, overall mosquito infestation indices this year are lower than that of the previous years. The mosquito infestation index in September was 2.5 per cent, which decreased significantly from 9.5 per cent in June. The index available for October also remains at a low level. Regarding the investigation area of the local case, the latestarea gravidtrap index (AGI) in October was 1.7 per cent, while the AGI in September was 0.9 per cent, indicating the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive. Among which, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, these measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


ãã The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures. The Environment and Ecology Bureau held Steering Committee meeting this afternoon to lead relevant departments to step up mosquito prevention and elimination measures; the district offices of the FEHD will hold interdepartmental meetings at district level to undergo risk assessment and conduct targeted measures.

Latest surveillance data
-----------------------------

âãã Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

ãã According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 868 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (October 19 to 25), showing a decrease compared to the previous week (October 12 to 18), which reported 2 086 cases. Most of the cases (199 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen last week, followed by Foshan (130 cases), Guangzhou (124 cases) and Shenzhen (102 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.


Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

ãã Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

ãã Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
ãã The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

ãã To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

ãã The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況（附圖）,2025-10-27 21:39,2025-10-27 22:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700696.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月二十七日）下午五時，中心錄得三宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心正繼續聯同政府多個部門和相關機構採取適當防控措施，全力預防基孔肯雅熱在本地扎根和減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

最新個案資料
——————

首宗個案涉及一名55歲女子，住所位於黃大仙。昨日（十月二十六日）確診首宗本地個案後，中心透過主動查找懷疑個案時，得悉該個案是鳳德邨一間學校一名員工。初步調查顯示，她於十月十一日至十二日到訪廣東省汕尾市，返港數天後，再於十月十九日獨自到訪廣東省深圳市。她於十月二十四日出現發燒、皮疹及關節痛，昨日傍晚到廣華醫院急症室求醫，中心接獲通報後即時安排患者進行檢測。與她一同行到訪汕尾市的人士及她的三名家居接觸者暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。由於患者在潛伏期內曾在兩個受影響地點（包括深圳市及鳳德邨範圍）活動，她的感染源頭有待確定，中心會對病毒進行基因分析，以判斷是否與昨天確診的本地個案有流行病學關連，調查仍在進行中。

第二宗個案涉及一名67歲男子，住所位於東涌。初步調查顯示，他於九月二十九日至十月二十四日獨自到訪廣東省佛山市。他於十月二十三日出現發燒及關節痛，翌日回港到北大嶼山醫院急症室求醫。他有三名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

第三宗個案涉及一名76歲女子，住所位於將軍澳。初步調查顯示，她於十月十七日至二十六日獨自到訪廣東省廣州市及惠州市。她於十月二十二日出現發燒及關節痛，於當地醫院求醫。她於十月二十六日回港，並到將軍澳醫院急症室求醫。她有兩名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

三名病人均獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定，他們的血液樣本均對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。由於上述67歲男子及76歲女子於潛伏期曾到訪廣東省，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

政府全方位防控基孔肯雅熱
————————————

中心正按流行病學調查及風險評估進行防控工作，包括為個案的家居接觸者或共同暴露於感染源頭的人士提供醫學監察及健康建議，如他們出現相關病徵，中心會安排化驗檢測。中心人員和當區關愛隊已向當區約八千戶民居派發問卷及宣傳單張，並會繼續聯絡居民發放資訊，了解及跟進他們的健康情況。中心亦已發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺。

今日晚上八時，中心和黃大仙民政事務處在鳳德社區中心合辦教育講座，以期加深市民對這種蚊傳疾病的認識，一同參與防控工作，護己護人。而中心昨晚舉行的網上講座，總觀看人次超過4 100。

另外，中心由昨日起設立熱線（電話：2125 2373）及在鳳德商場二樓設立醫護站，為出現相關症狀的居民作評估。截至今日下午五時，中心已為約1 300居民作評估，其中七名出現相關症狀的市民接受抽血檢查，等候化驗結果期間，他們會按中心建議，使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，以有效防蚊。熱線及醫護站會繼續每日由上午九時至下午八時運作。

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。事實上，今年整體蚊患指數較往年為低，九月份的蚊患指數為2.5%，較六月份高峰的9.5%明顯下降，而十月份已有的指數亦同樣處於低水平。在這個本地個案的調查區域，最新十月的分區指數為1.7%，九月的指數為0.9%，顯示白紋伊蚊分布並不廣泛。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。環境及生態局今日下午已召開督導委員會會議，指導各相關部門在其所屬範疇內加強防蚊滅蚊；食環署各分區辦事處亦會在地區層面召開跨部門會議，進行風險評估，並落實各項針對性措施。


最新監測數據
——————

​自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

 根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（十月十九日至二十五日）廣東省新增868宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較對上一周（十月十二日至十八日）的2 086宗顯著下降。上周大部分個案（199宗）在江門巿錄得，其次為佛山（130宗）、廣州（124宗）及深圳（102宗）。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；

Special meeting of Pest Control Steering Committee convened to strengthen interdepartmental preventive work against chikungunya fever (with photo),2025-10-27 20:20,2025-10-27 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700644.htm,"In response to the first locally acquired case of chikungunya fever (CF) recorded yesterday (October 26), the Environment and Ecology Bureau convened the interdepartmental Pest Control Steering Committee (PCSC) special meeting today (October 27), to urge relevant departments to strengthen anti-mosquito measures in the areas under their purviews. The district offices of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will also hold interdepartmental meetings at the district level to undergo risk assessment and conduct targeted measures.

In the special meeting, the PCSC was briefed by the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health, the FEHD, the Home Affairs Department (HAD), the Housing Department (HD), etc. regarding the first local CF case, and discussed further measures to prevent CF from taking root locally and urged departments to strengthen mosquito elimination work in areas under their purviews.

Details of the local CF case

Representatives from the CHP explained to the attendees the details of the local CF case and the CHP's risk assessment. As at October 26, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 47 CF cases this year, including one local case recorded yesterday and 46 imported cases. Except for one male patient with chronic diseases who passed away, the remaining cases were with mild symptoms. The CHP recorded the first local CF case on October 26. Given that the activity areas of the local case patient are primarily within Fung Tak Estate in Wong Tai Sin, the CHP cannot rule out the possibility that unidentified infected patient(s) in the area may have transmitted the virus to mosquitoes in the estate, leading to her infection.

In light of the first local case, the CHP will initiate infection control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong. This includes providing medical surveillance and health advice to household contacts of the case or those with common exposure to the source of infection. The CHP will arrange for laboratory testing if they presented with relevant symptoms. Besides carrying out questionnaire surveys, the CHP has set up a health consultation booth at 2/F, Fung Tak Shopping Centre, where assessments will be provided to residents with relevant symptoms from yesterday. The CHP has also set up an inquiry hotline (2125 2373) and conducted online and physical seminars.

The CHP, together with the FEHD, have inspected various locations in the vicinity of patient's residence, conducted vector investigations and mosquito control operations to minimise the risk of local transmission. Furthermore, the CHP has issued letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and reminding them to stay vigilant.

Prevent the spread of CF

In the meeting, the representative of the FEHD reported to the PCSC the situation of mosquito proliferation since the beginning of this year. The overall gravidtrap indices (GI) for Aedes albopictus from July to September 2025 (8.1 per cent in July, 5.3 per cent in August and 2.5 per cent in September) were below 10 per cent and remained at a relatively low level.

The FEHD also reported to the PCSC the situation of mosquito infestation in the investigation area of the local case, as well as follow-up actions have been, or will be done, by the FEHD in response to the local case including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


 To prevent the spread of CF, the FEHD has been proactively implementing the following mosquito prevention and control measures:


Convening special meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to co-ordinate frontline departments and stakeholders to strengthen mosquito control, and to allocate resources to carry out targeted and sustained mosquito control actions based on the GI and locations with higher risks;
Enhancing inspections at construction sites, works areas and private residences. Enforcement actions will be taken against violations involving mosquito breeding;
Collaborating with departments such as the HD and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) to strengthen inspections in public areas, public housing estates and parks. Upon detection of mosquito breeding grounds, immediate actions will be taken;
Inviting the HD and property management companies to conduct mosquito control campaigns in housing estates and encourage resident participation;
Working with the District Offices to assist in mosquito prevention and control at locations with infestation issues, such as ""three-nil"" buildings;
Issuing letters to the property management and pest control industry to remind them the implementation of mosquito prevention and control measures, and organising seminars to disseminate the latest information on CFand mosquito prevention.The Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene today reminded the property management trade to properly carry out mosquito control measures in venues under their management;
Strengthening inspections of schools and facilities for the elderly and children, reminding and assisting them in mosquito prevention;
Strengthening public education and publicity through promotional videos, posters and leaflets to remind the public to adopt mosquito control measures; and
Enhancing dissemination of the area GI for Aedes albopictus to raise awareness among citizens in districts with higher readings.


During the Chung Yeung Festival period, the FEHD will enhance the cleaning and mosquito prevention efforts at public cemeteries and columbaria. The FEHD urged the public to co-operate by clearing stagnant water and refuse after tomb-sweeping to prevent mosquito breeding. Containers such as lunch boxes, drink cans, plastic bags and buckets for burning incense should also be removed. Furthermore, managers of private cemeteries have also been notified and urged to implement corresponding mosquito prevention measures.

The Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology, and the Chairperson of the PCSC, Miss Diane Wong, urged at the meeting all departments to contact their stakeholders to initiate appropriate infection control measures with a view to preventing the further spread of CF. The FEHD also urged all departments to further strengthen anti-mosquito measures and carry out intensive mosquito control operations in areas under their purview. In additions, inspections will be conducted on a sampling basis, situations that worth concern will be reported to senior management, aiming to ensure that the mosquito infestation is properly addressed.

The Government also urged members of the community to stay vigilant and carry out personal protective measures, as well as implement mosquito control measures at their household, work place and nearby environment, so as to prevent further transmission of CF.

The meeting today was chaired by Miss Wong. Government bureaux, departments and organisations attending the meeting were the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department; the Architectural Services Department; the Civil Engineering and Development Department; the Development Bureau; the Department of Health; the Drainage Services Department; the Education Bureau; the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department; the Environmental Protection Department; the FEHD; the Government Property Agency; the Hospital Authority; the HAD; the HD; the Highways Department; the Information Services Department; the Lands Department; the LCSD; the Marine Department; the Social Welfare Department and the Water Supplies Department."
防治蟲鼠督導委員會召開特別會議　加強跨部門防控基孔肯雅熱（附圖）,2025-10-27 19:42,2025-10-27 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700606.htm,"因應本港昨日（十月二十六日）錄得首宗感染基孔肯雅熱的本地個案，環境及生態局今日（十月二十七日）召開政府跨部門防治蟲鼠督導委員會（委員會）特別會議，敦促各相關部門在其所屬範疇內加強防蚊滅蚊；食物環境衞生署（食環署）各分區辦事處亦會在地區層面召開跨部門會議，進行風險評估，並落實各項針對性措施。

委員會在特別會議上就首宗本地基孔肯雅熱感染個案聽取了衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）、食環署、民政事務總署（民政總署）、房屋署等匯報，並商討進一步的措施，以全力防止基孔肯雅熱在本地扎根，以及促請各部門在其管轄範疇內加強滅蚊工作。

本地基孔肯雅熱感染個案詳情

中心代表向各與會者講述本地基孔肯雅熱感染個案的詳情及其風險評估。本港今年（截至十月二十六日）累計錄得47宗基孔肯雅熱個案。當中包括於十月二十六日錄得的1宗本地個案及46宗輸入個案。除了一名有長期病患的男患者病逝之外，其餘個案均為輕症。中心於十月二十六日錄得首宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案。鑑於患者的活動範圍主要局限於黃大仙鳳德邨內，因此，中心不排除有未確診的患者在區內，將病毒傳播給邨內的蚊蟲，導致患者受感染。

針對首宗本地個案，中心會聯同政府多個部門和相關機構採取跟進防控措施，全力預防基孔肯雅熱在本地扎根和減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響，包括為個案的家居接觸者或共同暴露於感染源頭的人士提供醫學監察及健康建議，如他們出現相關病徵，中心會安排化驗檢測。除進行問卷調查外，中心於十月二十六日起在鳳德商場二樓設醫護站，為出現相關症狀的居民作評估，亦已設立查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373），以及舉行網上及實體教育講座。

中心亦已聯同食環署人員實地視察患者家居一帶的地點，進行病媒調查及滅蚊，減低本地傳播的風險。此外，中心已發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺。

防止基孔肯雅熱傳播

在會議上，食環署代表向委員會匯報今年初至今的蚊患情況。二○二五年七月至九月的整體白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數（七月為8.1%；八月為5.3%及九月為2.5%），全部指數均低於10%，保持在較低水平。

另外，食環署亦向委員會匯報本地個案的調查區域的蚊患情況，以及食環署針對本地個案已採取或將會採取的跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑和清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


為防範基孔肯雅熱的傳播，食環署積極採取以下防控蚊患措施：


在各分區召開「跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組」特別會議，協調前線部門及各持份者加強滅蚊，根據指數或風險較高的地點，調配資源採取具針對性和持久性的防蚊滅蚊行動；
加強巡查建築地盤及工地，以及私人住宅，對發現蚊子滋生的違規情況採取執法行動；
聯同房屋署及康樂及文化事務署等不同部門在公共地方、公共屋邨、公園等加強巡查，如發現蚊子滋生地，會即時採取行動；
邀請房屋署及物業管理公司在屋邨及屋苑進行滅蚊運動，並鼓勵居民參與；
聯同各區民政事務處，協助有蚊蟲滋生情況的地方如「三無大廈」進行防蚊滅蚊工作；
已向物業管理及防治蟲鼠業界發信，提醒業界落實防治蚊患的措施，以及通過舉辦講座，向業界講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況及防蚊資訊，包括食環署署長今日與物管業界的會面中，亦再次提醒大家須做好其負責範圍的防蚊滅蚊工作；
加強巡查學校以及長者和幼兒設施，提醒和協助他們防蚊；
持續加強公眾教育及宣傳，通過宣傳短片、海報及單張等途徑，提醒市民採取措施防治蚊患；及
加強發布各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，提升指數較高地區市民的防蚊意識。


重陽節期間，食環署會加強轄下各公眾墳場及骨灰安置所的潔淨及防治蚊患工作，並呼籲市民合作，掃墓後要清除積水及清理垃圾，避免蚊蟲滋生；飯盒、飲品罐、膠袋及化寶鐵桶等容器亦要妥善清理；亦已通知私人墳場負責人，促請他們採取相應的防蚊措施。

環境及生態局副局長兼委員會主席黃淑嫻在會上促請政府各部門與其持份者聯絡，採取適當防控措施，以防止基孔肯雅熱進一步蔓延。食環署亦在會上呼籲各部門在其管轄的範圍內，進一步加強防治蚊患工作和進行密集式滅蚊的工作。食環署會抽樣進行視察並將值得關注的情況向高層匯報，務求令蚊患情況獲得適切處理。

政府亦呼籲市民大眾不要掉以輕心，必須做好個人防護措施，以及家居、工作及附近環境的防蚊滅蚊措施，以防止基孔肯雅熱進一步蔓延。

今日的會議由黃淑嫻主持，出席的決策局、政府部門及機構代表有：漁農自然護理署、建築署、土木工程拓展署、發展局、衞生署、渠務署、教育局、機電工程署、環境保護署、食環署、政府產業署、醫院管理局、民政總署、房屋署、路政署、政府新聞處、地政總署、康樂及文化事務署、海事處、社會福利署和水務署。"

Cleaning service company licensee jailed for employing illegal workers,2025-10-27 19:05,2025-10-27 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700596.htm,"  A cleaning service company licensee was convicted of charges of being an employer of a person who was not lawfully employable and was jailed for six months by the Shatin Magistrates' Courts last Thursday (October 23).

  During an anti-illegal workers operation conducted by the Immigration Department (ImmD) on March 29, 2023, two Vietnamese females, aged 43 and 50, were arrested for working as cleaning workers in a residential estate at Kwun Tong. Among them, one Vietnamese woman was a holder of a recognisance form, which prohibits her from taking any employment and another Vietnamese woman was an illegal immigrant. The illegal workers were jailed by the Shatin Magistrates' Courts earlier and were sentenced to imprisonment for 15 months and 16 months respectively.

  A further investigation revealed that the illegal workers were employed by the same cleaning service company, and thus the licensee of the cleaning service company was arrested. The licensee is a Hong Kong permanent resident, male, aged 49. He is charged with two counts of ""employing a person who is not lawfully employable"" as he did not take all practicable steps to ascertain whether the applicant was lawfully employable prior to employment. After the trial, the licensee was sentenced to four months of imprisonment on both charges, with part of the sentencesto run consecutively, resulting in a total of six months' imprisonment by the Shatin Magistrates' Courts last Thursday (October 23).

  The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."
清潔服務公司持牌人因僱用非法勞工被判入獄,2025-10-27 19:05,2025-10-27 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700595.htm,"一名清潔服務公司持牌人因僱用不可合法受僱的人被定罪，於上星期四（十月二十三日）在沙田裁判法院被判入獄六個月。

入境事務處（入境處）調查人員於二○二三年三月二十九日的反非法勞工行動中，在觀塘一個住宅屋苑內拘捕兩名從事清潔工作的非法勞工。該兩名被捕非法勞工為越南籍女子，年齡為四十三及五十歲。其中一名越南籍女子持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」），另一名越南籍女子則為非法入境者。該兩名非法勞工早前在沙田裁判法院被判入獄，分別被判監禁十五及十六個月。

跟進調查發現該兩名非法勞工均受僱於同一清潔服務公司，調查人員其後拘捕該清潔服務公司的持牌人。該持牌人為一名香港永久性居民男子，年齡為四十九歲，他因並未在聘用僱員前採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱，被控兩項「僱用不可合法受僱的人」的控罪。經審訊後，兩項控罪均被判監禁四個月，部分刑期同期執行。他於上星期四（十月二十三日）在沙田裁判法院合共被判監禁六個月。

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

SFST's speech at BEA Union Investment's 18th Anniversary Celebration (English only),2025-10-27 18:45,2025-10-27 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700450.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the BEA Union Investment's 18th Anniversary Celebration today (October 27):

Brian (Co-Chief Executive of The Bank of East Asia, Limited (BEA), Mr Brian Li), Adrian (Co-Chief Executive of BEA, Mr Adrian Li), Mr Haagmann (member of the Executive Board of Union Investment, Mr André Haagmann), Janet (Chief Executive Officer of BEA Union Investment, Ms Janet Li), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 It is my great honour to address you today at BEA Union Investment's 18th Anniversary Celebration. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to BEA Union Investment for hosting this distinguished gathering and for your remarkable 18 years of outstanding performance in serving Hong Kong's asset management sector. It is a privilege to join you in celebrating this milestone, and to reflect on the bright future ahead for Hong Kong's asset and wealth management industry.

Hong Kong's strength in asset and wealth management

 Over the past years, we have witnessed remarkable performance for the asset and wealth management sector of Hong Kong. Hong Kong has firmly established itself as Asia's leading fund management hub, with our asset and wealth management business reaching an impressive HK$35 trillion last year, equivalent to 11 times of our GDP (Gross Domestic Product). This growth was driven by an 81 per cent surge in net fund inflows, fueled by facilitating policies that have attracted new capital for management in our city. Notably, 54 per cent of these assets were sourced from investors outside the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong, reinforcing our status as an international wealth management hub. This momentum has continued into this year, with Hong Kong-domiciled SFC (Securities and Futures Commission)-authorised funds recording net inflows of HK$270 billion in the first half of the year. Also, in the latest Global Financial Centres Index, Hong Kong maintained the top three positions globally in the ""banking"", ""investment management"", ""insurance"" and ""finance"" sectors, underscoring our position as Asia's premier asset and wealth management hub as recognised by international investors.

 The robust fund management ecosystem in Hong Kong is a cornerstone of our ambition as a global financial centre, attracting diverse capital and expertise that promote economic growth and innovation. The presence of world-class fund managers strengthens our position as a centre for international investment, connecting Asia with global markets. Our city is home to over 650 private equity firms, managing over US$230 billion in capital as of June this year, making Hong Kong the second-largest private equity hub in Asia. Also, Hong Kong hosts at least 2 700 single family offices, and we are Asia's largest cross-boundary wealth management centre. Market research indicates that we are on track to become the global leader for cross-boundary wealth management in a few years' time.

Progressive regulatory reforms on asset and wealth management

 Our regulatory framework continues to evolve in support of this vibrant industry. In February this year, regulators issued a circular clarifying requirements for authorising closed-ended funds that invest mainly in private and less liquid assets, such as private equity, private credit, and infrastructure equity or debt. This encourages sizable alternative asset funds, particularly those with regular income streams, to list in Hong Kong. Additionally, the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) Schemes Authority clarified in May this year that MPF funds may invest in approved listed private equity funds, providing greater flexibility in their fund allocation choices.

 To enhance operational efficiency, regulators have issued a circular to streamline suitability assessments for sophisticated professional investors. This initiative simplifies processes, improves client experiences, and facilitates more seamless transactions, ensuring that sophisticated professional investors can operate and allocate assets with agility in our dynamic market. These measures reflect Hong Kong's unwavering commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment catering to the needs of global wealth management.

 Ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate BEA Union Investment once again on 18 years of excellence and leadership in Hong Kong's wealth management industry. Your success is a testament to the strength and dynamism of our financial ecosystem. Hong Kong's forward-thinking policies and strategic vision position our city as the ultimate destination for wealth management. I invite global investors, family offices, and financial institutions to leverage our robust platform to achieve their wealth preservation and growth objectives. Together, let us continue to build a vibrant and prosperous future for Hong Kong as the world's leading wealth management hub.

 Before I conclude, I encourage all financial market participants to actively participate in the coming Legislative Council General Election on December 7 by casting your votes. It is of utmost importance for accelerating the development of Hong Kong's economy and our markets. Thank you."
