Delivering a speech at the dinner reception, the Director of the SHETO, Mrs Laura Aron, highlighted that the HKSAR Government has focused on economic development, achieving remarkable results. She encouraged citizens and enterprises in Shanghai and the East China region to continue leveraging Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"" to explore business opportunities, invest, and pursue employment or entrepreneurship in Hong Kong. She also expressed hope for continued robust co-operation between Shanghai and Hong Kong in areas such as trade, innovation, culture, and youth development, fostering mutual benefits.

Mrs Aron mentioned that next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the SHETO. She expressed gratitude to the Communist Party of China Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government for their support for the work of the HKSAR Government and the SHETO. The SHETO will continue to facilitate Shanghai-Hong Kong co-operation and support mutual success to make greater contributions to the country's high-quality development.

The Deputy Commissioner of Police (Management), Mr Chan Joon-sun, who is visiting Shanghai, attended the dinner. Speaking at the dinner reception, he shared that each anniversary occasion is an opportunity to review the development and achievements of ""one country, two systems"". With the introduction of the dual legislation on national security, Hong Kong has embarked on a new journey, advancing from chaos to order, and from stability to prosperity. It demonstrates the institutional advantages and strong vitality of ""one Country, two systems"". The country has been providing Hong Kong with opportunities to leverage its unique advantage of having strong support from the motherland and close connection with the world, promoting two-way exchanges between the mainland and the international community.

Hong Kong member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Shanghai and Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of New Frontier Group, Mr Carl Wu, also shared remarks at the dinner on Shanghai's support for Hong Kong-invested enterprises and the exchanges between Shanghai and Hong Kong.

The SHETO also invited emerging Hong Kong young artists to perform at the dinner reception, showcasing Hong Kong's diverse cultural charm through a suona performance blending Chinese and Western elements. Several Hong Kong students in Shanghai were also invited to showcase their talents.

The theme of the dinner reception was ""Multifaceted Hong Kong, Infinite Possibilities"", featuring interactive exhibition areas and photo check-in points themed around nine tourism development projects recently announced by the Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, alongside the giant pandas gifted by the Central Government as design ideas, offering guests an immersive, multifaceted, and engaging experience of Hong Kong.

The SHETO, in collaboration with Invest Hong Kong, also organised a seminar entitled ""Hong Kong: Enabler of Mainland Catering and Food Enterprises to Go Global"" today. Insights on the competitive advantages and development opportunities of Hong Kong as a preferred place for business were shared with over 100 representatives from catering, food and other industrial sectors in the East China region. They were encouraged to set up business in and develop overseas markets through Hong Kong."

A male passenger, aged 37, arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds inside his check-in suitcase. He was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (July 2).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
