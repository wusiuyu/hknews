Vice President Li (Vice President for Talent and International Strategy and Chair Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, the City University of Hong Kong, Professor Li Wen-jung), Professor Ho (Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences of the City University of Hong Kong, Professor Alfred Ho), Consul General Ficarra (Consul General of Italy in Hong Kong and Macao, Mr Carmelo Ficarra), Mr Naldini (Director of Fondazione Pistoletto Cittadellarte and representative of Third Paradise, Mr Paolo Naldini), Ms Maino (Ambassador of Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (CNMI), Ms Sara Sozzani Maino), Mr Guardini (Conscious Creative Director of the Fashion to Reconnect, Mr Tiziano Guardini), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon, and a very warm welcome to ""Fashion to Reconnect: A Tale of Two Style Capitals"".

It is my tremendous pleasure to join you at this special moment, where Hong Kong and Italy meet through the powerful lenses of fashion, art and sustainability.

""Fashion to Reconnect"" is organised by the City University of Hong Kong, supported by the Consulate General of Italy in Hong Kong, and brought to life in partnership with Fondazione Pistoletto Cittadellarte, and Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana, or CNMI in brief, the esteemed organiser of Milan Fashion Week. My heartfelt thanks to all our partners for making this visionary programme a reality in Hong Kong. We eagerly anticipate even closer collaborations between Hong Kong and Italy in the cultural and creative industries.

At the heart of this project is the visionary concept of the Third Paradise by Michelangelo Pistoletto-a call to rebalance artifice and nature. Hong Kong's interpretation is both ambitious and uniquely our own: six site-specific Third Paradise art installations are unfolding across five of our city's cultural landmarks. These include the Sophia Loren House in Wan Chai, Hong Kong International Airport, the main campus of the City University of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Cultural Centre, and the Hung Hom Harbourfront Promenade. These works invite everyone to experience sustainability in familiar urban spaces, reimagined through fabrics, movement, light and storytelling.

Here at ArtisTree, the ""Fashion to Reconnect"" exhibition, curated by Mr Tiziano Guardini, brings together sustainable masterpieces from 16 Italian brands and artisans with the creativity of nine Hong Kong-based designers. From couture craftsmanship to circular materials, from archive footwear to experimental silhouettes, this is a journey that elevates fashion as both an artistic medium and a social fabric.

In the coming days, we will convene a symposium, a roundtable and seminars, gathering elite professionals from Italy, Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area. These platforms are designed to exchange perspectives on sustainable fashion and cross-sector collaboration, fostering partnerships that will amplify the impact of creativity across global markets.

""Fashion to Reconnect"" is a highlight of the Hong Kong Fashion Fest 2025. Sponsored by the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency and organised by our industry partners, the Hong Kong Fashion Fest is transforming our city into a dazzling stage for global fashion and creative dialogue from November 22 to December 7. We are proud to ""bring in"" global excellence, while ""going out"" with Hong Kong's distinctive voice.

Finally, as we look to the future, I would like to encourage all eligible voters in Hong Kong to fulfil our civic responsibility by voting in the 2025 Legislative Council General Election on December 7. Together, we can continue to build a better Hong Kong.

Before I close, I wish to congratulate ""Fashion to Reconnect"" on a grand opening and convey my very best wishes for ""Fashion to Reconnect"" a resounding success. Thank you."

按國家／地區分析

二零二五年十月份與二零二四年同月比較，輸往亞洲的整體出口貨值上升15.6%。此地區內，輸往大部分主要目的地的整體出口貨值錄得升幅，尤其是馬來西亞（升139.4%）、越南（升56.0%）、台灣（升50.2%）、印度（升31.8%）和中國內地（內地）（升9.8%）。

展望未來，環球經濟維持溫和增長，加上近期外圍貿易政策的不確定性減退和對電子相關產品的需求持續，應會在短期內有利香港的商品貿易增長。政府一直致力加強香港與不同市場的經貿聯繫亦將繼續提供支持。然而，貿易壁壘的持續影響仍值得關注。政府將保持警覺。

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that the value of merchandise exports grew markedly further by 17.5% in October over a year earlier. Exports to most major markets saw robust growth. Analysed by commodity, exports of most major commodities increased, particularly for exports of electrical equipment, machinery and mechanical appliances which sustained strong growth.

  Looking ahead, sustained moderate growth of the global economy, coupled with easing in external trade policy uncertainty recently and persistent demand for electronic-related products, should be conducive to Hong Kong's merchandise trade growth in the near term. The Government's ongoing effort to enhance Hong Kong’s economic and trade ties with different markets will also continue to provide support. Yet, the lingering impacts of trade barriers still warrant attention. The Government will stay vigilant.

大家好。很高興今天有機會參與由《信報》主辦，以「創新推動綠色可持續未來」為主題的ESG論壇2025，與大家分享香港在綠色和可持續金融方面的最新發展。

正如剛才鄧總所說，這六年來，ESG（環境、社會及管治）由概念變成很具體的行動，我相信大家來不是為形象，而是看到ESG的發展對經濟、社會，甚至全球都有所禆益。

在這方面，我相信氣候變化無疑是當今全球面臨最緊迫的挑戰之一。香港是福地，雖然今年我們遇上颱風的次數破紀錄地多，但相對其他地方，我們生活上受到的影響仍然有限。颱風或極端天氣在香港以外地方造成人命傷亡、地方嚴重受破壞的新聞時有所聞。香港作為地球村的一分子如何可以為應對氣候變化出多點力呢？剛於巴西貝倫落幕的第30屆聯合國氣候變化大會（COP30）為我們帶來答案。會議再次強調綠色資金在應對氣候變化中的關鍵作用。聯合國負責氣候行動的助理秘書長指出，發展中國家更受氣溫上升影響，因此要確保它們更快、更大規模地獲得氣候融資，改善基建系統。有與會代表亦提出要在早於危機出現前增強發展中國家的抵禦能力，意味要擴大氣候融資的規模。不少地區代表都認為，合理配置財政資源是將計劃轉化為實際進展及願景轉化為具體行動的關鍵。

作為亞洲領先的國際金融中心和可持續金融樞紐，香港擁有既深且廣的資本市場，而政府亦將綠色和可持續金融列為重點工作之一，積極引導國際資本投資至不同領域的可持續發展項目，為綠色金融轉型出力。截至今年九月，香港已有超過200隻獲證監會（證券及期貨事務監察委員會）認可的ESG基金，資產管理規模超過1.1萬億港元，較三年前分別增長百分之三十二及百分之二十三。債券市場方面，去年香港的綠色和可持續債務發行總額超過840億美元。其中約430億美元的綠色和可持續債券由香港安排發行總額，自二○一八年起連續七年居亞洲區市場的首位，佔地區總額約百分之四十五。

為更有效推動綠色金融轉型，政府一直與金融監管機構（包括香港金融發展局）和持份者緊密合作，循推動創新、市場發展、培養人才和國際及區域合作四個方向推動可持續金融發展，完善香港的綠色金融生態系統。接下來，我會向大家闡述一下我們循這四個方向做了甚麼，未來又有甚麼展望。

（一）推動創新

在政府可持續債券計劃下，我們自二○一九年起已成功發行合共約2,500億港元（約320億美元）等值的政府綠色債券，涵蓋港元、人民幣、美元和歐元四個幣種和不同年期（一至30年），為多個本地綠色項目融資。另外，政府本月中第三度成功發行代幣化綠色債券，等值接近100億港元，在交收過程中更應用了人民幣及港元代幣化央行貨幣（e-CNY及e-HKD），為未來融入其他形式的數碼貨幣奠定基礎，同時促進不同數碼基建之間的互操作性，充分展示香港在結合債券市場、綠色和可持續金融，以及金融科技方面的優勢和領導地位。特區政府會通過恆常化發行代幣化債券，助力市場建立更全面的基準，擴大數字金融的更廣泛應用，鼓勵產品和服務創新。

去年，政府推出綠色和可持續金融科技概念驗證測試資助計劃，很長的計劃名字，但其實是聚焦proof of concept，提供前期資助，推動進行綠色金融科技活動的科技公司或研究機構與本地企業合作，開發處理行業痛點而市場上未有使用案例的項目，以助力有關方案商業化和完成概念驗證，計劃已批出60個綠色金融科技方案，讓有潛力的綠色和可持續金融科技於香港的商業環境中更廣泛應用。

（二）市場發展

除了政府領頭外，業界在綠色金融市場的參與亦非常重要。我們推出的綠色和可持續金融資助計劃鼓勵更多綠色融資活動在港進行，同時吸引更多金融和專業服務提供者在港開設或擴充業務，以構建綠色金融生態圈。計劃已延長三年至二○二七年，並擴大資助範圍至轉型債券及貸款，鼓勵區內相關行業更充分利用香港的轉型融資平台，逐步實現減碳目標。截至今年十一月初，我們已向超過620筆在香港發行的綠色和可持續債務工具批出超過3.9億港元資助，涉及的債務總值超過1,700億美元（超過1.3萬億港元）。

香港金融管理局（金管局）去年五月也發表了首階段的香港可持續金融分類目錄，為市場參與者作出與綠色和可持續金融相關的決策時能有據可依，從而積極引導全球長期資本為符合《巴黎協定》的經濟活動提供融資，釋除「漂綠」憂慮。首階段的分類目錄已獲銀行和企業採用。為求分類目錄能更便於使用，金管局剛就第2A階段的原型完成公眾諮詢。第2A階段的原型引入多項優化措施，包括擴闊涵蓋的行業、增加經濟活動、加入包括中期減碳目標等轉型元素，以及新增「適應氣候變化」這項環境目標，以回應日益增長的融資需求。

（三）培養人才

推動綠色發展離不開對人才的培養。在技能培訓方面，政府於二○二二年年底推出綠色和可持續金融培訓先導計劃，供本地合資格從業員、相關專業人士和修讀相關學科的學生及畢業生申請。截至本月中，由本地大學的專業進修學院、專業機構、國際培訓機構等提供的合資格培訓及資歷接近100個，並會不斷更新。我們亦已批出超過9 100宗申請，資助總額約5,200萬港元。為持續支持本地綠色金融人才的培訓，這個計劃會延長至二○二八年。

我們也透過大型會議、研討會及其他持份者交流活動，加強與綠色和可持續金融相關的技能培訓和合作。今年九月圓滿舉行的第二屆香港綠色周獲得65家國際及本地公私營機構的支持，共舉辦42場活動，吸引超過14 500位來自全球逾75個地區的商業領袖、專家與學者齊聚香港。嘉賓對於香港綠色周活動的深度以及參與機構的多元化程度都有很高評價。

（四）國際及區域合作

可持續發展依靠世界各地的通力合作。在可持續披露方面，我們積極支持國際財務報告可持續披露準則（ISSB準則）的應用，去年十二月推出香港可持續披露路線圖，就大型公眾責任實體不遲於二○二八年全面採用ISSB準則提供清晰的路徑。國際財務報告準則基金會今年六月確認香港為全球首批以全面採用ISSB準則為目標的司法管轄區。政府會繼續聯同金融監管機構及持份者，支持香港可持續披露準則的實施。

香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）國際碳交易平台Core Climate是全球唯一以港元及人民幣結算自願碳信用的交易平台。港交所今年九月更與廣州碳排放權交易中心、深圳綠色交易所及澳門國際碳排放權交易所簽署合作備忘錄。這份大灣區內碳交易所之間的首份四方協議進一步推動知識交流與分享，加強區內碳市場和綠色金融生態圈發展的合作。未來，我們會繼續致力推動產品創新發展，金管局正聯同港交所合作研究碳交易代幣化技術的應用。政府亦會聯同內地相關監管部門和機構，研究國家參與國際碳市場的相關事宜。

大家若記得，我們在本月初舉辦了香港金融科技周，每年十一月都舉辦的。在今年的金融科技周，除金融科技外，還有另一個宣布，那就是總部設於北京的亞洲基礎設施投資銀行（亞投行）宣布決定在香港設立辦事處。金立群行長（亞投行行長）宣布決定時就指出，香港一直堅實和積極地支持亞投行工作，而香港作為亞洲領先的綠色金融樞紐，更是實現經濟轉型，將保護環境的項目轉化為可投資項目的理想地。現時，亞投行已與金管局及香港按揭證券有限公司建立了戰略合作夥伴關係，透過貸款、基金投資、創投項目、基建貸款抵押證券等方式，為亞洲的可持續發展和氣候轉型調動資金，加速亞洲地區向可持續繁榮未來的轉型進程。日後，我們會繼續全力協助亞投行透過助力基礎設施融資，推動亞洲基礎設施的可持續發展，尤其是亞投行在香港設立了辦事處以後。

最後，我祝願今日的論壇圓滿成功，相信大家也會從今日的多個討論環節中對ESG與可持續發展領域的關鍵議題有更深入了解，與我們一起為全球可持續發展出力。謝謝。"
FSD holds International Aquatic Rescue Technical Exchange in HK and Chaozhou (with photos),2025-11-25 15:55,2025-11-25 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112400491.htm,"âThe Fire Services Department (FSD) holds the International Aquatic Rescue Technical Exchange (IARTX) in Hong Kong and Chaozhou between today (November 25) and November 28. The four-day IARTX aims to bring together personnel of rescue teams from the Mainland, Hong Kong, Macao and neighbouring Asia-Pacific regions for experience sharing in aquatic rescue operations. The IARTX is co-organised by the Institution of Fire Engineers (Hong Kong Branch) and the China Hong Kong Fire Protection Association.

The opening ceremony, officiated by Deputy Director General of the National Fire and Rescue Administration Mr Xu Zhongshun; the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung; the Director of Fire Services, Mr Andy Yeung; the Deputy Director of Fire Services (Operations), Mr Derek Armstrong Chan; the Deputy Director of Fire Services (Public Safety and Corporate Strategy), Mr Wong Ka-wing; and Steward of Hong Kong Jockey Club Mrs Ann Kung, was held today at the Fire and Ambulance Services Academy.

In his speech delivered at the ceremony, Mr Tang mentioned that the more apparent climate change has become, the more it has been causing extreme weather to be more frequent and intense. Noting that aquatic rescue has been among the most challenging and high-risk emergency operations, Mr Tang said he believes that the valuable interactions at the IARTX are essential for experts and frontline practitioners from across the region to deepen mutual understanding, share best practices and foster robust operational co-ordination. He also expressed his hope in the FSD's capability to make a concrete contribution to the country's strategies on disaster management, deepening international partnership to better protect lives across the region.

Mr Yeung welcomed the frontline aquatic rescuers and experts from the Asia-Pacific region who are converging for the first time in Hong Kong for an in-depth exchange of rescue techniques, sharing a common hope of better serving the communities. He noted that the more intense typhoons and severe flooding brought by climate change have made the mission of emergency rescue more critical than ever, and that the greatest impact can be achieved through cross-regional collaboration. He expected the exchange to foster a culture of continuous improvement among rescue teams, with their shared dedication to further excel in aquatic rescue standards being showcased.

The IARTX takes place in Hong Kong for the first two days, offering participants activities including individual and group on-site training, rescue equipment demonstrations, and experience-sharing sessions. They can share experiences on aquatic rescue operations and explore the feasibility of applying certain techniques in their own regions. On November 27, the participants will travel to Chaozhou and visit the National Southeast Emergency Rescue Center to learn about the country's efforts in enhancing rescue techniques and personnel training with advanced technologies. They will also inspect spots with higher flood risk to understand the country's rescue strategies for flooding.

The IARTX is one of the key initiatives under the Fire Services Department's Disaster Management Programme funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust. Participants include rescue personnel from the National Fire and Rescue Administration, the Macao Fire Services Bureau, the Macao Customs, and representatives from eight Asia-Pacific countries, namely Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam. They join hands to strengthen cross-regional professional co-operation and contribute to the continuous development of aquatic rescue operations."

鄧炳強在典禮上致辭時說，氣候變化加劇令極端天氣越趨頻繁，強度亦更高。他指出水域救援是極具挑戰的高風險救援任務，是次會議的寶貴交流機會讓區內專才與前線人員加深互相了解，分享最優質的實戰經驗，令協作基礎更為穩固。他又寄望香港消防處為國家災害管理作出切實貢獻，加深國際合作，跨地域攜手守護生命。

楊恩健感謝來自亞太地區的前線水域救援專才首次雲集本港，就救援技術深入交流，以期為社會提供更優質的服務。他指出氣候變化帶來強烈颱風及嚴重水浸，讓救援人員實踐救災扶危使命更刻不容緩，因此跨地區救援協作可發揮最大的影響力。他希望是次交流讓各地救援團隊培養不斷追求進步的文化，同時展現對追求更卓越水域救援水平的共同承諾。

國際水域救援技術交流會議首兩天活動在香港舉行，讓參與者透過個人及團體實地訓練、救援工具展示、救援個案經驗分享等環節，交流水域救援技術和心得，並探討應用在所屬地區的可行性。隨後，交流團將於十一月二十七日前往潮州，參觀國家東南區域應急救援中心，了解國家如何利用先進科技令救援技術和訓練更臻完善，並到市內水浸風險較高的地點視察，了解國家在水浸事故中的應對策略。

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on November 24 to noon today (November 25), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 76 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

保安局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-11-25 14:17,2025-11-25 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112500379.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（十一月二十五日）上午出席國際水域救援技術交流會議開幕典禮後會見傳媒的談話內容：

保安局局長：各位香港市民，各位記者朋友，大家好。我剛剛出席了由香港消防處主辦的國際水域救援技術交流會議。這個會議集合了來自內地、澳門、香港，還有來自八個亞太地區相關水域的救援專家一起進行會議，就着水域救援科技、技術和戰術進行交流。這個會議一共有四天，首兩天在香港，之後兩天會在內地進行一些觀察活動。

我也想趁這個機會談談，我昨天擬根據《維護國家安全條例》發出命令，禁止兩個組織在香港運作，這兩個組織是「香港議會」和「香港民主建國聯盟」。我是考慮過相關證據，覺得作出這個禁令是維護國家安全的必須行動。我亦會根據法例，在我作出最後決定前，讓他們作出申述。

這兩個組織建立的目的就是為了分裂國家和顛覆國家政權。他們推行所謂「自主」，即是「港獨」，以及推行所謂「香港憲法」，其實這就是破壞國家《憲法》的根本制度，亦破壞香港和國家的政權機關。「香港議會」較早前有19名成員離開了香港、潛逃了，我們已經通緝他們，亦根據《維護國家安全條例》將他們列為指明潛逃者。另外，他們在香港的一位成員也在較早時因涉及煽動意圖而被我們拘捕和檢控，並被判刑12個月。另外，「香港民主建國聯盟」其中四個香港成員也是被我們以「串謀分裂國家」罪拘捕並檢控，現正等候法庭程序。我也理解到這個組織的其中一個活躍成員因為呼籲人們在接着的選舉（立法會換屆選舉）中投白票和不投票，而被廉政公署以《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》通緝。

我想指出，當我正式宣布這兩個組織成為受禁組織後，任何人以這些組織的成員（身分）行事，或者意圖煽動其他人加入這些組織，或者參與這兩個組織的任何活動，或者提供任何援助，都是違法。最高判刑是罰款港幣100萬元和判監14年。我希望大家切勿以身試法。

我也想指出，除了我剛才提到有些人煽動他人投白票或不投票，違反《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》，也有些人是死心不息，想破壞這次選舉或者宣傳選舉活動的進行。到目前為止，有35宗相關罪案，大部分都是與刑事毀壞有關，即是毀壞一些宣傳物品。到目前為止，已經有29人被拘捕。我也想在此再重申一次，任何人如果以任何方法企圖影響選舉，我們必須和必定會嚴正執法。

我想講講，十二月七日的選舉，其實是彰顯了國務院在二○二一年發布的《「一國兩制」下香港的民主發展》白皮書的精神，透過完善選舉制度達致良政善治以及推進香港的發展。所以，我在此呼籲所有香港的合資格選民在十二月七日出來行使你們的權利，以及履行你們作為公民的義務，出來投票，選出愛國愛港、能夠為香港發展貢獻力量的人出任議員。多謝各位。

記者︰關於「香港議會」和「建國聯盟」禁止運作，可否說說當局有沒有發現有任何人在香港暗地裏運行或煽動其他人去做這件事？實行了這個措施之後，期望可以達到甚麼效果或增加哪方面的阻嚇力？另外，剛才也提到關於選舉有一些破壞宣傳單張、偷旗的罪行出現，當局有沒有研究過他們有甚麼企圖？有沒有組織性？又或者是否如你之前所說，一些死心不息的分子想破壞，或都是一些個別案件為主？另外，有關抹黑和杯葛投票，很多都是一些外籍人士或在國外的人士在呼籲，有沒有措施可以令他們停止這做法，或者當局有甚麼計劃阻止這些事繼續發生？

保安局局長︰剛才你提到該兩個組織其中之一的「香港議會」，我們已經就一個在香港的成員以「煽動意圖」罪將他拘捕和成功檢控，判刑12個月。至於另一個組織，即「香港民主建國聯盟」，也有四名在香港的成員已被我們以「串謀分裂國家」罪拘捕。我在此再次強調，任何人從事這些違法活動，我們必定嚴正執法。剛才我提到，到目前為止，有35宗針對選舉的刑事毁壞或偷宣傳品的罪案，共拘捕29人。到目前為止，我們相信這些案件都是個別案件，但無論你出於甚麼意圖，企圖影響選舉的話，我們必然嚴正執法，有關人士亦必然要面對法律後果。

記者︰近期社交平台上看見有人付款鼓勵投票，這做法有否違法？近期中日關係緊張，警方高層選擇不出席日本駐港總領事館舉辦的活動，那是甚麼活動？

保安局局長︰首先我想說說，《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》對於有甚麼行為可以做、甚麼不可以做，已說得很清楚，我們會根據法例行事。另外，對於我們和日本的關係，行政長官亦說得很清楚，特區政府必然會跟隨國家的政策處理，我們亦認為日本的相關行為是不適合，我們也會根據國家的政策決定如何處理下一步。

記者︰局方表示已向該兩個組織發書面通知，在局方作最終決定前作申述，申述方面會否有限期？

保安局局長︰今次我們給予七天時間讓他們作出申述。當然如果他們認為有需要，可延長時間，我們也會考慮是否合理，再決定是否要延長時間。多謝各位。"

Madame Drulhe (Consul General of France in Hong Kong and Macau, Ms Christile Drulhe), Mr Serge Carreira (representative of the Paris Fashion Week), Joseph (Chairman of the Hong Kong Design Centre, Mr Joseph Lo), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Bonjour. Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you at the opening ceremony of the ""Play, Pose & Pixel"" Digital Fashion Exhibition, curated by the Hong Kong Design Centre and our dear friends from the Paris Fashion Week.

  Digital fashion has surged in popularity over the past decade and is now integrated across the entire fashion chain - from design to manufacturing and retail. It saves time and materials in sample production, enables business without physical products, and transcends geographic limits with virtual try-ons. Without a doubt, it is a key trend shaping the future of fashion.

  I am delighted that the Hong Kong Design Centre is presenting this ""Play, Pose & Pixel"" Digital Fashion Exhibition in partnership with the prestigious Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, in short FHCM, the organiser of the Paris Fashion Week. This exhibition explores pioneering fashion technology and showcases the boundless possibilities of digital fashion. In fact, it stands as one of the most anticipated highlights of this year's Hong Kong Fashion Fest.

  The curatorial team behind the exhibition, FabriX, continues to surprise and inspire by merging augmented reality (AR) with the latest fashion. Today, they return with their iconic AR Try-on Kiosk, allowing users to try on digital outfits. Even if you are as short as me, you can look really good in their kiosks trying on the latest fashion. It captures selfies and collects photos of their favourite virtual fashion pieces.

  Among the seven designers featured in the virtual experience, three are emerging local Hong Kong talents, showcasing the vibrant creativity of Hong Kong's new generation of designers. This also reflects our commitment to nurturing local creators and elevating them onto the global stage.

  Before arriving in Hong Kong, the exhibition had already made a presence at the Paris Fashion Week this past September. Some of the works you see here today were first shown in Paris, including collaborations between international designers and multidisciplinary artists. Through photography, dance, 3D animation and AI, these pieces blur the lines between fashion, performance and digital arts.

  Now, for the first time, the exhibition is staged in Hong Kong. I encourage you all to explore it fully and immerse yourselves in the dynamic world of digital fashion.

  The next two weeks will be filled with fashion events across the city. Curated by various partner organisations and sponsored by the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency, the Hong Kong Fashion Fest will run until December 7, offering a rich series of design experiences in multiple locations. I warmly invite you to be part of this exciting journey.

  My congratulations to the Hong Kong Design Centre for bringing this visionary fashion event to life - infusing fresh energy and innovation into our fashion scene and showcasing the achievements of Hong Kong designers. My thanks also go to the FHCM for their partnership and dedication to advancing digital fashion, inspiring the future of the fashion industry.

  Last but not least, I wish this exhibition every success. And to everyone in the audience, stay joyful and glamorous. Thank you very much."
HKMC's record HK$25.3 billion public benchmark bond issuance,2025-11-25 12:05,2025-11-25 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112500281.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited (HKMC) announced today (November 25) the successful issuance of its multi-currency public benchmark bonds totalling HK$25.3 billion (or US$3.3 billion equivalent) (Issuance) under its US$30 billion Medium Term Note Programme.

Following a series of effective investor roadshows, the Issuance was book-built and priced in Hong Kong on November 18, 2025. The landmark Issuance was the HKMC's largest-ever public bond offering, breaking its own record set in October 2024 when it launched its third social bonds of HK$23.8 billion equivalent.

The multi-currency benchmark bond issuance with four tranches comprises HK$10 billion 2-year, CNH 5 billion 3-year and US$1 billion 5-year bonds in conventional bond format; and a 30-year HK$2 billion bond in social bond format. The Issuance was well received by a diverse group of high-quality local, Southbound Bond Connect and international institutional investors, including multilateral development banks, government-related funds, banks, insurance companies, MPF and pension funds, asset management companies and private banks, with a combined peak orderbook of around HK$80 billion equivalent and final allocation to around 250 accounts.

The 30-year Hong Kong dollar (HKD) social bond tranche is the largest-ever 30-year HKD bond issuance in Hong Kong, and also the first-ever social bond issuance in Asia Pacific with proceeds being used to support the HKMC's Reverse Mortgage Programme (RMP) that provides essential financing for the elderly in Hong Kong. Major terms of the Issuance are highlighted in the Annex.

The RMP is one of the ""HKMC Retire 3"" products offering retirement planning solution for elderly homeowners to unlock the values of their properties to provide a supplementary cashflow, thereby helping the elderly to maintain their quality of life during retirement, and to meet healthcare and other livelihood needs. As at end-October 2025, the HKMC has received 8 776 applications under the programme with an average property value of around HK$5.5 million and average monthly payout of around HK$15,900. The average age of borrowers was 69 years old.

  Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Executive Director of the HKMCMr Howard Leesaid, ""This landmark multi-currency bond issuance has further solidified Hong Kong's position as Asia's leading international bond issuance hub and the premier offshore Renminbi business centre. The Issuance also further underscored the HKMC's role in fostering the development of public bond market across various currencies and tenors, paving the way for other issuers to better connect with local, Chinese Mainland and overseas investors.""

  Executive Director and the Chief Executive Officer of the HKMC, Mr Colin Pou,said, ""This record-breaking bond issuance has proven to be highly effective in bringing new investors to the Hong Kong capital market. It was also a testament to investors' unwavering confidence in Hong Kong and the HKMC. Moreover, the first-ever social bond tranche dedicated for reverse mortgage loans not only promoted sustainable financing and financial inclusion for the elderly, but also made contribution to the development of retirement planning market and silver economy in Hong Kong.""

The HKMC appreciates the professional advice and tremendous support from the Joint Global Coordinators, Joint Bookrunners, Joint Lead Managers and the Joint Structuring Banks, which comprised a total of 29 local and international financial institutions, in making the Issuance successful. The list of participated financial institutions is set out at the Annex.

The social bond tranche was issued pursuant to the HKMC's Social, Green and Sustainability Financing Framework (SGS Framework).

按揭證券公司發行創紀錄的253億港元公募基準債券,2025-11-25 12:05,2025-11-25 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112500282.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港按揭證券有限公司（按揭證券公司）今日（十一月二十五日）宣布，在其300億美元中期債券發行計劃下成功發行總額為253億港元（或等值33億美元）的多幣種公募基準債券。

經過一系列卓有成效的投資者路演，是次債券於二○二五年十一月十八日在香港以簿記建檔方式發行並定價。本次具有里程碑意義的發行是按揭證券公司有史以來規模最大的公募債券發行，打破了按揭證券公司於二○二四年十月創下的紀錄，當時發行了第三批社會責任債券，金額達238億港元等值。

此次發行的多幣種基準債券包括四筆分別為100億港元2年期、50億元人民幣3年期和10億美元5年期傳統債券，以及20億港元30年期社會責任債券。此次發行受到多元化的優質本地、南向債券通及國際機構投資者熱烈追捧，其中包括多邊開發銀行、政府相關基金、銀行、保險公司、強積金及退休基金、資產管理公司及私人銀行。債券發行最高峰期的合計認購金額約800億港元等值，最終配售給約250家機構投資者。

是次發行的30年期港元社會責任債券不僅是香港有史以來規模最大的30年期港元債券，也是亞太地區首筆用於支持安老按揭計劃以為香港長者提供必要融資的社會責任債券。有關發行的主要條款列載於附件。

安老按揭計劃是「HKMC退休3寶」之一，旨在為長者業主提供退休規劃方案，讓他們可以釋放其物業價值，為他們提供額外現金流，從而幫助他們在退休後維持生活質素，並滿足醫療保健和其他生活需要。截至二○二五年十月底，按揭證券公司在安老按揭計劃下收到8 776宗申請，平均物業估值約為550萬港元，平均每月年金約15,900港元。借款人的平均年齡為69歲。

香港金融管理局副總裁兼按揭證券公司執行董事李達志表示：「這次具有里程碑意義的多幣種債券發行進一步鞏固了香港作為亞洲領先的國際債券發行中心和首屈一指的離岸人民幣業務中心的地位。本次債券通過各種幣種和不同年期發行，進一步突顯了按揭證券公司在促進公募債券市場發展的角色，為其他發債機構提供了連接本地、中國內地及海外機構投資者的機會。」

按揭證券公司執行董事兼總裁鮑克運表示：「此次創紀錄的債券發行已證明其在吸引新投資者進入香港資本市場方面成效顯著，也印證了投資者對香港及按揭證券公司的堅定信心。此外，這次歷來第一筆用於支持安老按揭貸款的社會責任債券不僅促進了為長者提供可持續融資和普惠金融，也為香港的退休規劃市場發展和銀髮經濟作出了貢獻。」

按揭證券公司衷心感謝聯席全球協調行、聯席賬簿管理行、聯席牽頭行及聯席結構銀行團隊合共29家本地及國際金融機構的專業意見及廣大支持，使本次發行得以成功。參與發行的金融機構名單載於附件。

是次社會責任債券是根據按揭證券公司的《社會責任、綠色及可持續金融框架》（框架）發行。有關框架及第二方意見、本次社會責任債券的發行前第二方意見報告的詳情，請瀏覽www.hkmc.com.hk/chi/investor_relations/sustainable_finance.html。"

Deputy Director Xu Zhongshun (Deputy Director General of the National Fire and Rescue Administration), distinguished guests, respected colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. On behalf of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), it is my great pleasure to welcome you all to Hong Kong and to the opening ceremony of the International Aquatic Rescue Technical Exchange (IARTX) 2025.

I extend a particularly warm welcome to delegation members from our national rescue teams, the Macao SAR (Special Administrative Region) rescue team, and distinguished experts from our neighbouring countries and regions across Asia Pacific. Your presence today exemplifies a shared commitment to advancing regional collaboration in disaster prevention, response and rescue.

In recent years, the realities of climate change have become ever more apparent, with extreme weather events occurring more frequently and with greater intensity, including here in Hong Kong. Against this backdrop, the HKSAR Government remains unwavering in its dedication to enhancing disaster preparedness, strengthening emergency response capabilities, and safeguarding public safety.

Aquatic rescue is among the most challenging and high-risk domains of emergency operations. Through the technical exchange platform provided by the IARTX, experts and frontline practitioners from across our region will come together for practical training, live demonstrations, thematic presentations and site visits. These valuable interactions are essential for deepening mutual understanding, sharing best practices and fostering robust operational co-ordination.

Such collaboration does more than enhance our technical capabilities, it forges the spirit of solidarity so vital in times of crisis. The knowledge and experience gained through this exchange will further empower the Hong Kong Fire Services Department to contribute effectively to our national strategies on disaster management, and will help us deepen international partnerships to better protect lives in our region.

The HKSAR Government is also steadfast in developing Hong Kong into an international innovation and technology hub. In the field of aquatic rescue, we actively promote the integration of advanced technologies, such as underwater remotely operated vehicles and side-scan sonar rescue tools, so as to enable our rescuers to work more safely, efficiently, and precisely.

Today's gathering vividly demonstrates that disaster risk knows no boundaries, and neither should our efforts to address it. Co-operation, co-ordination and cohesion are the pillars of collective resilience. I am confident that, through the collaborative spirit of the IARTX, we will forge even stronger partnerships, further strengthen our capabilities, and secure a safer future for our communities.

In closing, I wish the IARTX 2025 every success, and hope that all participants find the coming days to be both fruitful and inspiring. Thank you."

Projects under the low-altitude economy ""Regulatory Sandbox"" launched in March have been progressively implemented, injecting smart vitality and creating new prospects for Hong Kong. We will continue to engage with the industry and gather diverse perspectives to enable the drafting of the Action Plan on Developing Low-Altitude Economy by the end of next year. This will establish the foundational infrastructure for the top-level design of the entire low-latitude economy, providing the industry with a clear and forward-looking trajectory.""

  The HKPC is a technical partner of the ""Regulatory Sandbox"" launched by the Working Group on Developing Low-altitude Economy. At the event, the Chief Digital Officer, Mr Edmond Lai, stated that the HKPC has been actively contributing to and advancing innovation and practical implementation in Hong Kong's low-altitude economy sector. With ""Regulatory Sandbox X"" focusing on more complex and technologically advanced application scenarios, the HKPC will continue to serve as a technical partner, striving for R&D in forward-looking areas such as new materials, new energy, and advanced traffic management systems, to support the industry in strengthening technical standards and application capabilities, fostering the adoption of innovative solutions in real-world environments.

In the first batch of ""Regulatory Sandbox"", 38 projects were selected, with 29 projects already implemented, covering a wide range of fields and application scenarios, including emergency and rescue, logistics and distribution, inspections and safety maintenance, surveillance, and low-altitude infrastructure, injecting new smart dynamics into the city.

The HKSAR Government today (November 24) held the first seminar on the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee at the Central Government Offices.

The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the CPC Central Committee, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, and the Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, Mr Zhou Ji, delivered speeches at the seminar. Mr Hou and Mr Zhu gave presentations respectively, providing in-depth explanations of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee as well as the key contents and significance of the Recommendations of the CPC Central Committee for Formulating the 15th Five Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development. The two members of the publicity delegation also responded to questions raised by participants. Mr Lee delivered concluding remarks.

He said, ""The Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee holds great significance. It is an important meeting convened at a critical juncture which falls on the successful conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the preparatory period of the 15th Five-Year Plan. Studying and implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee well is a major task for us. At present, the world is undergoing accelerated transformations unseen in a century, but transformations often come with opportunities. The Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan focus on high-quality development, achieving self-reliance and strength in science and technology through cultivating ""new quality productive forces"", and promoting high-level opening up, which bring historical opportunities to Hong Kong. We must gain a deep understanding of the guiding ideology, major principles, as well as the objectives and tasks, for the economic and social development during the 15th Five-Year period, assist Hong Kong in solidly advancing various measures for its economic and social development during the 15th Five-Year period, actively align with the national 15th Five-Year Plan, comprehensively promote the development of finance and innovation and technology as dual engines, engage in broader and closer exchanges and co-operation around the globe, and actively integrate into and serve the overall strategy of national development.""

In his address, Mr Zhou said that the first seminar by the central authorities' publicity delegation in Hong Kong was targeted at the HKSAR's governance team, which fully demonstrated the Central People's Government's high regard for the Chief Executive and the governance team, their deep concern for Hong Kong compatriots, and their strong support for Hong Kong's development. The Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee has made top-level designs and strategic plans for the country's development over the next five years, and has also provided clear guidance for Hong Kong's economic and social development. He believed that through this briefing, everyone would be able to further strengthen their confidence in victory from the achievements of national development, better recognise opportunities and prospects from the current situation and tasks, grasp more accurately the direction of development from the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan, fully leverage the institutional strengths of ""one country, two systems"" and the unique advantages of connecting the Mainland and the world, promote Hong Kong's better integration into and service to the overall national development, and continuously opening up new horizons for the high-quality development of the cause of ""one country, two systems"".

Mr Zhu provided a comprehensive, systematic and in-depth interpretation around the great significance of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, the situation and tasks for the national economic and social development during the 15th Five-Year period, and the guiding principles and main objectives for the economic and social development. He elaborated on the seven major objectives to be focused on during the 15th Five-Year period, namely significant achievements in high-quality development, substantial improvements in scientific and technological self-reliance and strength, fresh breakthroughs in further deepening reform comprehensively; notable cultural and ethical progress across society, further improvements in quality of life, major new strides in advancing the Beautiful China Initiative, and further advances in strengthening the national security shield. He indicated that the formulation and implementation of the 15th Five-Year Plan will inject strong development momentum into Hong Kong, and Hong Kong should better integrate into and serve the overall national development and participate in national strategies such as the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, with development opportunities becoming more numerous and development vitality growing ever stronger.

Mr Hou introduced the strategic tasks and major measures that have significant traction, driving and supporting roles in advancing Chinese modernisation during the 15th Five-Year period by fields, including building a modernised industrial system, achieving greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology, building a robust domestic market, moving faster to develop a high-standard socialist market economy, promoting high-standard opening up, accelerating agricultural and rural modernisation, promoting coordinated regional development, fostering a thriving socialist culture, working harder to ensure and improve public wellbeing, accelerating the green transition in all areas of economic and social development, modernising China's national security system and capacity, as well as promoting high-quality modernisation of national defence and the armed forces. Having regard to the plans and requirements set out in the Recommendations regarding scientific and technological innovation and the development of innovation hub, he suggested that Hong Kong leverage its own strengths and advantages, strengthen forward-looking and pioneering basic research, expand the development and openness of application scenarios, and build a hub for high-calibre talents as well as an open platform hub for global scientific and technological cooperation.

About 500 people attended today's first seminar, including principal officials of the HKSAR Government, representatives of the Executive Council, representatives of the Legislative Council, representatives from the Judiciary, and heads of major statutory bodies.

The HKSAR Government will hold the second seminar on promotion of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee tomorrow at 9.30am. Arrangements have been made for Radio Television Hong Kong and the government website to broadcast the seminar live in full for citizens to listen and watch."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-24 21:06,2025-11-24 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/24/P2025112400809.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 24), the CHP has recorded one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
-----------------------------

The case involves a 60-year-old female living in Fanling. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Guizhou from November 10 to 17 and Shenzhen in Guangdong on November 18 and 19. She developed joint pain and rash on November 22, and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of North District Hospital on the following day (November 23). She was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient's household contact and her travel collaterals to the Chinese Mainland are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

ã Since the patient stayed outside Hong Kong during her incubation period, the CHP considered that she was infected during travel. The case is classified as imported. The CHP will report the case to the relevant health authorities in the Chinese Mainland.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 71 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

 Among the recently recorded imported cases, five reside in Tsing Yi. The CHP's epidemiological investigation revealed that their activities during the incubation and infectious periods overlapped in Tsing Yi North, primarily around Tsing Yi centre and around the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. The CHP has notified the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of the locations visited by the five patients, for mosquito control operations. The CHP is also performing genomic sequencing and analysis on patient samples, comparing them with other local and imported cases, to determine whether these cases are linked. As some confirmed cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considered the trails to be a higher-risk area. As a precautionary measure, the CHP urged individuals who have hiked in the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area since November 1 to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the CHP's enquiry hotline (2125 2373). The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. The CHP will assess symptomatic individuals and arrange blood tests if necessary. The CHP has not received any enquires from symptomatic individuals over the past day. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.



The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Good evening, everyone. A very warm welcome to the opening ceremony of the HKGX 2025 IBF World Championships, especially our friends who have travelled from abroad. Welcome.
  
It is a tremendous honour for Hong Kong to host this prestigious event for the first time. Following the success of January's IBF World Cup and IBF Para Bowling World Championships, we are once again privileged to welcome the world's bowling elites to our city. Over fifty of the world's top men's and women's teams will compete across four events, showcasing the finely-honed skills and profound perseverance that have brought them here. The stage is set for an unforgettable display of athletic excellence.

My sincere gratitude goes to the Hong Kong, China Tenpin Bowling Congress for their meticulous organisation and unwavering dedication to promoting tenpin bowling as an elite sport in Hong Kong. I would also like to thank the title sponsor, the Hong Kong Gold Exchange, alongside all other sponsors, partners and volunteers. Your concerted support has been indispensable in making the world-class event a reality.

As we celebrate the passion of this World Championships, let us also take this opportunity to embrace the spirit of active participation in our community. With the 2025 Legislative Council General Election approaching, I strongly encourage every registered voter in Hong Kong to fulfil their civic duty and cast their vote on December 7. Together, let us elect patriotic, capable and visionary legislators who will contribute to the continuous prosperity of Hong Kong.

Before I close, I wish the World Championships a resounding success, and to all bowlers, the very best of luck. May you bowl with precision, passion, and the true spirit of sportsmanship. Thank you."

After the evaluation mechanism became a regular practice, it has expanded to cover 10 disciplines. ""Professional Title"" is a unique evaluation system for professional qualifications adopted by the Mainland. It serves as an important benchmark for evaluating the skills and qualification levels of professionals and provides a basis for construction enterprises to recruit and promote talent.

With the concerted efforts of the Guangdong and Hong Kong governments, an evaluation mechanism for Hong Kong professionals was established in 2023. It was first implemented as a pilot scheme in 2024 across five engineering disciplines: civil engineering, geotechnical, highway, electrical, and measurement, control and instrumentation. This year, in addition to continuing the evaluation for these five engineering disciplines, the mechanism has been expanded to include three more engineering disciplines: mechanical engineering, telecommunications engineering and cyber security, as well as two construction disciplines: architecture and engineering costing. This expansion increases the number of professional disciplines covered by the ""Professional Title"" evaluation mechanism to 10. Since the implementation of the mechanism, a total of 578 Hong Kong professionals have obtained Mainland ""Professional Title"" qualifications.

The Permanent Secretary for Development (Works), Mr Ricky Lau, today (November 24) attended the celebration ceremony jointly organised by the Hong Kong Institute of Architects, the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers and the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors. In his speech, he noted that the Development Bureau (DEVB) has been dovetailing with the National 14th Five-Year Plan regarding the strategy of high-quality development of the GBA, and is committed to driving Hong Kong's construction and engineering sectors to seize opportunities to pursue development in the Mainland cities of the GBA, thereby better integrating into the national development.

He added that the successful implementation of the engineering ""Professional Title"" evaluation is a crucial step in achieving the interfaces of regulatory frameworks in the development of the GBA. The relevant measure also aligns with the Recommendations of the Communist Party of China Central Committee for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development recently adopted at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to help enhance the international status and competitiveness of the construction industry. In addition, the mechanism creates broader development prospects and favourable conditions for the construction industry of Hong Kong, as well as allowing Hong Kong professionals to gain a better position and a wider vision to contribute to the country's development.

The DEVB will continue to maintain close collaboration with relevant Mainland authorities and co-ordinate the local construction sector to take forward the relevant work, with a view to extending in an orderly manner the ""Professional Title"" evaluation mechanism to other eligible construction-related professions, such as planning and landscape architecture."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-24 20:05,2025-11-24 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/24/P2025112400775.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月二十四日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名60歲女子，居於粉嶺。初步調查顯示，她於十一月十至十七日前往貴州，並於十一月十八及十九日到訪廣東省深圳市。她於十一月二十二日出現關節痛和皮疹，翌日（十一月二十三日）到北區醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。她的一名家居接觸者，及與她到中國內地的同行人士暫時都沒有出現病徵，全部人正接受醫學監察。

由於病人在潛伏期曾到訪香港以外地區，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，會把個案通報中國內地的衞生當局。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得71宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。


政府全方位跟進
———————

就近日錄得五宗輸入個案的患者均居於青衣，中心的流行病學調查顯示，他們在潛伏期及發病後在青衣北活動的範圍有重疊，主要包括青衣市中心一帶及青衣自然徑附近。中心已把個案活動的地點通知食物環境衞生署（食環署），進行控蚊滅蚊行動。中心亦正就病人樣本進行基因排序及分析，並對比其他本地及輸入個案，以確定他們之間是否有關聯。由於部分確診個案報稱，在青衣自然徑行山期間曾被蚊叮咬，中心認為青衣自然徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心呼籲自十一月一日起曾在青衣自然徑一帶行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，盡快求醫，並致電中心早前設立的查詢熱線（2125 2373），熱線每日由上午九時至下午八時運作。中心會為出現病徵人士進行評估，如有需要，會安排抽血化驗，而過去一天中心未有接獲有病徵人士致電查詢。中心的流行病學調查仍然繼續。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Tony (Chairman of the Vocational Training Council, Mr Tony Tai), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. It gives me great pleasure to join you at the Denim Delight Party of the ""4th Hong Kong Denim Festival - Denim Artistry"", which celebrates the artistry of denim through a spectacular fashion show staged against Hong Kong's stunning skyline and unparalleled view of Victoria Harbour.

Under the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau of the Hong Kong Government, the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency (CCIDA) is delighted to have sponsored the Hong Kong Denim Festival since its inauguration in 2019.This eveningmarks the fourth edition of the Festival, which is also one of the programmes of the second edition of the CCIDA-sponsored Hong Kong Fashion Fest that is organised by a host of our partners.

Hong Kong Fashion Fest provides a platform for local and international fashion brands to showcase and connect, to ultimately develop Hong Kong into a fashion design hub in Asia. I welcome all of you to experience the vibrant spirit of Hong Kong fashion, and to join us at a variety of exciting fashion events, including fashion shows, exhibitions, conferences and workshops, which will be held in various locations in Hong Konguntil December 7.

Denim is a symbol of versatility. Its application has evolved from making streetwear like jeans and jackets to creating high-end fashion, stylish accessories, home decor, and even artistic pieces. The Hong Kong Denim Festival will present a wide range of denim works, guiding audiences through the enduring artistry and craftsmanship of denim, and showcasing its vast possibilities.

Today's fashion show shines a spotlight on the emerging generation of designers who are driving Hong Kong's creative scene forward with bold ideas and fresh perspectives. We will see the creative designs of eight local young denim artisans alongside the work of a well-established Hong Kong fashion label. It demonstrates one of the Government's nurturing efforts for local design talents.

This year, the Denim Festival has gone beyond to real businesses by arranging in these two months for our emerging local designers to showcase their talents through in-store campaigns with the support of leading denim brands. Through such collaborations, our designers will be able to gain exposure, hands-on retail experience and first-hand feedback from buyers, which will definitely uplift their portfolios and empower them to grow their businesses.

I would like to extend my gratitude to the Hong Kong Design Institute of the Vocational Training Council for organising this meaningful programme. We look forward to more opportunities in the fashion industry that inspire young talents to pursue entrepreneurship and provide them with exposure on the global stage.

We are determined to develop our fashion design industry and bring about more opportunities to our designers. On a related note, let me take this opportunity to call on everyone in Hong Kong's fashion community to support the 2025 Legislative Council General Electionon December 7. Cast your vote to elect representatives who can help shape a brighter future for Hong Kong.

I wish you all a wonderful and enjoyable evening. Thank you."

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-11-24 19:02,2025-11-24 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/24/P2025112400707.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (November 24) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From November 16 to 22, the CHP recorded two community-acquired and one imported LD cases. The details of the cases are as follows:


A 72-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses, living in Sai Kung District, classified as a community-acquired case;
A 43-year-old male patient with good past health, living in North District, classified as a community-acquired case; and
A 70-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses, who travelled to the Chinese Mainland during the incubation period, classified as an imported case.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that these are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these three cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of November 22, 147 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively. Regarding the three cases announced over the past two weeks involving individuals who participated in package tours to Beijing during their incubation period, the CHP has proactively contacted individuals who joined the affected package tour groups. No other group members have been found to have contracted LD so far.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

  Now, I would like to say a few words in English. Shannon, it is such a great honour to see you here. Today, not only do we commemorate the extraordinary life of Mr Bruce Lee, but also acknowledge the enduring legacy that continues to inspire generations across the globe. Bruce Lee was more than a martial artist; he was a philosopher, a cultural bridge, and a visionary who reshaped how the world perceives strength, discipline, and identity.

Shannon, your presence here today reminds us that his spirit lives on not only in the films he left behind for us, but also in the work you have done and carried forward all the years with such dedication and passion. Through the Bruce Lee Foundation and your tireless advocacy, you have ensured that your father's teachings remain accessible, relevant, and transformative across audiences. You embody the resilience and passion that your father championed, and we are deeply grateful for your commitment to preserving his message of selfâexpression, harmony, and empowerment. All these spirits are much treasured in Hong Kong and that we need to carry forward in this city we all love.

As we walk through this exhibition, we celebrate Bruce Lee's artistry and philosophy. Moreover, we honour you and the Lee family for continuing his mission. Thank you again for being here."
​運輸及物流局局長出席港鐵呈獻《李小龍誕生85周年紀念展：無形之道》開幕典禮致辭,2025-11-24 18:56,2025-11-24 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/24/P2025112400678.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（十一月二十四日）出席港鐵呈獻《李小龍誕生85周年紀念展：無形之道》開幕典禮的致辭全文：

金總（香港鐵路有限公司行政總裁金澤培博士）、Shannon（李小龍基金會創辦人暨會長、李小龍女兒李香凝）、Donnie（演員甄子丹）、各位傳媒朋友、圍觀的市民：

大家好，今日我很高與可以和各位朋友聚首香港站，與大家一同見證《李小龍誕生85周年紀念展》開幕的歷史時刻。雖然李小龍先生離開我們已超過半世紀，但他至今仍然是武術界一代宗師、在世界各地是香港的代表人物。他開創的截拳道，以中國的詠春為根基，糅合他自學的拳擊、劍擊等，這種將中西之長合為己用的精粹，正正就是我們的香港精神。

李小龍先生為香港電影開拓了一個新時代，將武打電影帶到一個新層次。其實他成年後只拍了四套半香港電影，數量珍稀，但這四套半電影足以成就一個電影傳奇，成為了跨國界的香港文化象徵。他位處於頂尖，仍然不斷突破和提升自我，這當然與港鐵的營運宗旨不謀而合，亦代表我們對港鐵的高度期望。

今日很榮幸可以與甄子丹先生同場支持這個活動。丹爺憑藉《葉問》系列，讓香港動作片再度登上世界舞台，展現了中國武術的力量與智慧，是香港影壇的驕傲，更是文化傳承的象徵。

不少香港及海外電影曾在港鐵取景，包括港鐵的車廂、月台、車站以及輕鐵站等，可見港鐵與電影結下不解之緣，相信不少市民和旅客乘搭港鐵時都能夠勾起這些難忘和經典的回憶。正因為港鐵承載了這麼多電影上的經典，今次選址在港鐵香港站和中環站展出國際傳奇巨星李小龍先生的展覽和體驗活動，別具意義，讓每位市民和來自世界各地的旅客可透過這次體驗細味李小龍先生的武術智慧和力量，學習其哲學與不朽精神。

港鐵與每個市民的生活息息相關，站內乘客熙來攘往、絡繹不絕。港鐵每日為超過500萬市民提供可靠的服務，我樂見港鐵不時花上心思，為旅客帶來小確幸。以今日香港站為例，利用這個空間締造一個不平凡的文化藝術展覽場地，為本應較為日常、沉悶的旅程，加添了不少生氣和心思。

李小龍先生將武術在頂尖中屢創高峰、求突破的精神，亦體現在我們的公共交通發展上。相信每位香港市民、乘搭過我們公交的旅客，都一定會肯定香港的公交發展，有「世一」的水平。尤其是我們有一個遍及全港九，很廣闊的鐵路網絡，接載市民接觸不同社區，帶他們到社會不同角落。

在此我要衷心感謝港鐵公司、李小龍基金會、香港文化博物館，以及香港舞蹈團今日來參加，為我們呈獻這場豐富而精彩的展覽，讓李小龍先生的精神走入每一位香港市民的生活。我誠邀每一位市民，不論是否李小龍的粉絲，都不要錯過這個探索和體驗的機會，尤其要領略李小龍「無形之道」意義和力量。

最後，我祝願展覽圓滿成功，特別可以吸引更多乘客和旅客在繁忙鬧市生活的步伐之中，駐足在此感受「無形之道」帶給大家的啓發和體驗。希望每一位都會收穫良多，多謝大家。"

尊敬的李家超行政長官、尊敬的孫尚武中聯辦副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、馮馬潔嫻主席（中國香港殘疾人奧委會會長兼香港特別行政區（特區）代表團籌備委員會（籌委會）主席）、霍震霆主席（中國香港體育協會暨奧林匹克委員會（港協暨奧委會）會長兼籌委會主席）、各位嘉賓、各位運動員、各位教練、各位朋友：

大家下午好。歡迎各位蒞臨中華人民共和國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會）香港特別行政區代表團授旗儀式。

四年一度的殘特奧會，是國家最高水平的綜合殘疾人士運動會。本屆賽事首次由廣東、香港和澳門三地聯合承辦，不僅體現了粵港澳大灣區進一步融合發展，更充分展現三地攜手合作、共同打造高水平體育盛事的決心和能力。殘特奧會是一個運動員展現毅力和堅韌精神的舞台，是一個每個人都可以親身支持的國家盛事，更是一個讓我們深化家國情懷、鞏固我們國民身分認同的重要機會。

本屆殘特奧會將於十二月八日正式開幕，香港將會派出超過420人的代表團參加，是歷來規模最龐大、參與項目最多的代表團。當中包括超過280位運動員和約140位隨隊工作人員和醫護人員，出戰14個殘運會競賽項目、4個殘運會大眾項目和7個特奧會項目。

這次是香港特區第八次參加殘運會，以及第六次參加特奧會。在上一屆殘運會和上一屆特奧會中，香港特區代表團在殘運會取得10金1銀6銅一共17面獎牌；並在特奧會取得25金9銀8銅共42面獎牌，成績令人鼓舞。在二○二四年巴黎殘奧會中國香港隊也勇奪3金4銀1銅。這些驕人的成績不但顯示香港運動員的水平非常高，亦展示香港特別行政區政府持續加大對體育發展的政策支持和資源投入，使香港具備培養世界級運動員的能力的方向正確。

舉例來說，在二○二五年到二六年度，香港特區政府對香港體育學院（體院）的撥款預算超過10億港元，用以支援體院培訓超過1 600名精英運動員，當中支持包括六個「A級」和四個「B級」殘疾人精英運動項目的發展。今年四月起，體院也在政府支持下首次為殘疾運動員引入「成年隊」的資助組別，相信可吸引更多殘疾人士投身運動員的行列，優化培訓階梯。

在今屆的殘特奧會，香港將會承辦五個項目，包括殘奧項目硬地滾球、輪椅擊劍、乒乓球（TT11組）、大眾項目輪椅舞蹈和特奧乒乓球。輪椅舞蹈早前在九月初已順利舉行，而香港隊取得3金2銅的亮麗成績。各位運動員能在香港主場出擊，機會實在十分難得，全港市民都會為你們打氣。我期待大家都能夠盡展所長、超越自我，為夢想奮鬥。

運動員成功的背後，必需要有政府政策支持和撥款，也有賴體育各界的共同努力。我衷心的感謝香港體育學院、港協暨奧委會、中國香港殘疾人奧委會、各個體育總會及體育機構、中國香港運動禁藥管制機構，以及其他所有在幕後默默付出的朋友。感謝你們與運動員並肩作戰，共同成就佳績。

同時，我也要特別感謝香港賽馬會贊助四億五千萬港元，支持香港賽區籌備十五運會（第十五屆全國運動會）和殘特奧會賽事。

殘特奧會將於兩個星期後開幕，香港賽區的比賽亦即將展開，各項的準備工作已進入衝刺階段。在剛於上星期五（十一月二十一日）圓滿閉幕的十五運會中，我們香港隊的成績令人非常鼓舞，取得破紀錄的9金、2銀、8銅。能夠在比賽中獲獎當然令人振奮，但能參與大型運動比賽本身已經是寶貴的經驗。我知道參與殘特奧的香港代表團已經整裝待發，熱烈期待與全國的精英運動員在賽場上互相比拼，又並肩追夢。我希望各位參與殘特奧的運動員享受比賽過程，突破自我，為理想拼搏。

殘特奧會將會在十二月八日開幕，在這一天之前，香港所有市民必定和必須全情關注和投入的另一件全城大事，就是十二月七日舉行的第八屆立法會換屆選舉。我呼籲所有的香港選民及早計劃，在十二月七日投票日當天履行公民責任，踴躍投下你重要的一票，並且積極鼓勵你身邊的親人、同事、朋友一起參與，選賢與能，投入選舉，共創未來。12·7（十二月七日）齊投票！

最後，我祝願殘特奧會圓滿成功，並預祝香港運動員在賽場上發揮最佳水平，追夢成功，再創輝煌。

謝謝大家。"
衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-11-24 18:37,2025-11-24 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/24/P2025112400692.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月二十四日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在十一月十六日至二十二日期間，中心錄得兩宗社區感染及一宗輸入的退伍軍人病個案，詳情如下：


72歲男病人，有長期病患，居於西貢區，屬社區感染個案；
43歲男病人，過往健康良好，居於北區，屬社區感染個案；及
70歲男病人，有長期病患，於潛伏期內曾到中國內地，屬輸入個案。


中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這三宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至十一月二十二日，今年錄得147宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。就上兩周公布共涉及三宗曾在潛伏期內參加前往北京的旅行團的個案，中心已主動聯絡參加涉事旅行團的人士，至今沒有發現其他團友感染退伍軍人病。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；

  A spokesman for the Security Bureau said, ""Pursuant to section 60(1) of the SNSO, if the Secretary for Security reasonably believes that it is necessary for safeguarding national security to prohibit the operation or continued operation of an organization specified in subsection (3) of that section in the HKSAR, the Secretary for Security may, by order published in the Gazette, prohibit the operation or continued operation of the organization. Having carefully considered all relevant information, the Secretary for Security takes the preliminary view that there are reasonable grounds to believe that it would be necessary for safeguarding national security to prohibit the operation or continued operation of these two organizations in the HKSAR and, as such, allows the two organizations to make representations, in accordance with section 60(4) of the SNSO, before making a final decision.

  ""The two organizations in question aim to subvert state power. Their objectives include promoting 'self-determination', making the 'Hong Kong Constitution', and overthrowing or undermining the basic system of the People's Republic of China established by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China or overthrowing the body of central power of the People's Republic of China or the body of power of the HKSAR.

  ""If the Secretary for Security finally decides to make orders to prohibit the operation or continued operation of the 'Hong Kong Parliament' and the 'Hong Kong Democratic Independence Union' in the HKSAR, the two organizations will become 'prohibited organizations'. Any person who engages in acts specified in sections 62 to 65 of the SNSO commits an offence, including acting as an officer-bearer or a member of a prohibited organization; participating in any activity or meeting of a prohibited organization; inciting any other person to become a member of a prohibited organization; and giving aid of any kind to or procuring any subscription or aid for a prohibited organization, and is liable upon conviction to a fine of HK$1,000,000 and imprisonment for 14 years.

  ""Endangering national security is a very serious offence. Such acts or activities may lead to extremely grave consequences. The Government of the HKSAR will, as always, resolutely, fully, and faithfully implement the Hong Kong National Security Law, the SNSO, and other relevant laws of the HKSAR for safeguarding national security to effectively prevent, suppress, and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law, and prohibit the operation of organizations that engage in activities endangering national security in the HKSAR."""

保安局發言人表示：「根據《國安條例》第60（1）條規定，如保安局局長合理地相信，禁止該條第（3）款指明的組織在特區運作或繼續運作，是維護國家安全所需者，則保安局局長可藉在憲報刊登的命令，禁止該組織在特區運作或繼續運作。保安局局長經小心考慮所有相關資料後，初步認為有合理理由相信禁止該兩個組織在香港特區運作或繼續運作，是維護國家安全所需，因此根據《國安條例》第60（4）條的規定，在作出最終決定前，讓該兩個組織可提出申述。」

「該兩個組織旨在顛覆國家政權，其目標包括推動『自決』、制定香港『憲法』，推翻、破壞《中華人民共和國憲法》所確立的中華人民共和國根本制度或推翻中華人民共和國中央政權機關或者特區政權機關等。」

「若保安局局長最終決定命令禁止『香港議會』及『香港民主建國聯盟』在特區運作或繼續運作，該兩個組織即成為『受禁組織』，任何人從事《國安條例》第62至65條所訂明的行為，即屬犯罪，包括：以受禁組織的幹事或成員身分行事；參與受禁組織的活動或集會；煽惑他人成為受禁組織成員；向受禁組織提供任何形式的援助或為其牟取會費或援助等，一經定罪，最高可處罰款$1,000,000及監禁14年。」

Woman arrested on suspicion of illegally selling topical product with undeclared controlled drug ingredients (with photo),2025-11-24 17:31,2025-11-24 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/24/P2025112400602.htm,"âThe Department of Health (DH) today (November 24) carried out an enforcement operation with the Police against the suspected illegal sale of a topical product containing undeclared controlled medicines (see photo) at a beauty parlour in Yuen Long.During the operation, a 48-year old woman was arrested on suspicion of the illegal sale of Part 1 poison and an unregistered pharmaceutical product.

  Following up on a case referred by the Hospital Authority, the DH earlier purchased a sample of a product called Rong Shi Gao Fu Kang Medical Antipyretic Gel from a beauty parlour on Wang Yip Street South in Yuen Long for analysis. Test results from the Government Laboratory revealed that the product sample contained clobetasol propionate and miconazole, which are Part 1 poisons under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138) (the Ordinance). The product is also suspected to be an unregistered pharmaceutical product.

The DH urged members of the public who have purchased the product concerned to stop using it immediately and reminded the public not to buy or use products of doubtful composition or from unknown sources. The DH will continue to investigate the incident and take appropriate follow-up actions.

Clobetasol propionate is a steroid substance for treating inflammation. Inappropriate application of steroids could cause skin problems and systemic side effects such as moon face, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, adrenal insufficiency and osteoporosis. Products containing clobetasol propionate are prescription medicines that should be used under a doctor's directions and be supplied in the premises of an Authorized Seller of Poisons (i.e. a pharmacy) under the supervision of a registered pharmacist upon a doctor's prescription. Miconazole is used for the treatment of fungal infections with side effects including local irritation and sensitivity reactions. Topical products containing miconazole should be supplied in a pharmacy under the supervision of a registered pharmacist.

According to the Ordinance, all pharmaceutical products must be registered with the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Hong Kong before they can be sold in the market. Illegal sale or possession of unregistered pharmaceutical products or Part 1 poisons are criminal offences. The maximum penalty on conviction of each offence is a fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment.

The DH reminded members of the public That all registered pharmaceutical products should carry a Hong Kong registration number on the package in the format of ""HK-XXXXX"". The safety, quality and efficacy of unregistered pharmaceutical products are not guaranteed.

People who have purchased the product concerned should stop using it immediately and consult healthcare professionals if in doubt or feeling unwell after use. They may submit the product to the Drug Office of the DH at Room 1804-06, 18/F, Wing On Kowloon Centre, 345 Nathan Road, Kowloon, during office hours for disposal."

Customs officers intercepted the incoming male passenger, aged 29, at Hong Kong International Airport on November 23 and seized 19 800 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $89,000 and a duty potential of about $65,000, from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

衞生署呼籲已購買上述產品的市民應立即停止使用，並提醒市民切勿購買或使用成分或來歷不明的產品。衞生署會繼續調查事件和採取適當跟進。

「丙酸氯倍他索」是用於治療炎症的類固醇藥物，不適當使用類固醇會引致皮膚問題及系統性的副作用，例如滿月臉、高血壓、高血糖、腎上腺機能不全和骨質疏鬆等。含有「丙酸氯倍他索」的產品屬處方藥物，須在醫生指示下使用，亦只可在註冊藥劑師監督下於獲授權毒藥銷售商（即藥房）憑醫生處方購買。「咪康唑」用於治療真菌感染，副作用包括局部皮膚刺激及過敏反應。含有「咪康唑」的外用產品亦只可在註冊藥劑師監督下於藥房出售。

根據《條例》，所有藥劑製品須獲香港藥劑業及毒藥管理局註冊，方可於市面銷售。非法售賣或管有未經註冊藥劑製品或第1部毒藥均屬刑事罪行，每項罪行一經定罪，最高罰款100,000元及監禁兩年。
