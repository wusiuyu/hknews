"Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao collaborate to prevent and control mosquito-borne disease, Chikungunya fever",2025-07-22 19:45,2025-07-22 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200757.htm,"In response to recent cases of Chikungunya fever (CF) recorded in Foshan of Guangdong and Macao, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (July 22) said that Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have been carrying out joint prevention and control of communicable disease involving the three places in accordance with the well-established liaison and communication mechanism. The CHP will continue to work closely with the health authorities in Guangdong Province and Macao, and will take appropriate preventive and control measures according to risk assessment to prevent the spread of CF in Hong Kong and protect public health.

Collaboration of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao on disease prevention and control

""Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have been working closely in communicable disease prevention and control, emergency response, and the co-operation mechanism for disease prevention and control. Owing to the communicable disease notification mechanism established by the three places, the CHP has kept abreast of the latest situation of CF in Guangdong Province. Although no confirmed CF cases have been recorded in Hong Kong so far this year, the increase in temperature and rainfall in summer is expected to aggravate mosquito infestation in Hong Kong. Additionally, people travel more frequently during summer holidays, including to regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. Consequently, there is an increased risk of imported cases and local transmission of mosquito-borne diseases, such as CF and dengue fever. Members of the public are advised to take precautionary and personal protection measures against mosquitoes, both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Measures to cope with risk of importation of mosquito-borne disease

Dr Tsui added that, in order to cope with the risk of imported case of mosquito-borne disease, the CHP's Port Health Division has stepped up inspections at the boundary control points to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. The Port Health Division also conducts temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fever will be assessed on health conditions and referred to hospitals for follow up when necessary. The CHP will also maintain close liaison with relevant stakeholders, such as airlines and the travel industry, to provide the latest disease information and health advice in a timely manner.

In addition, the CHP has issued a letter to all doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong to provide them with the latest epidemiological information and appeal them to watch out for CF-related symptoms among those who return to Hong Kong from outbound travel. If CF cases are detected, they should be immediately referred to hospitals for treatment and reported to the DH in accordance with the established mechanism, so that the DH can initiate epidemiological investigations, and implement prevention and control measures.

In view of the recent outbreak of CF in neighbouring areas, the Hospital Authority (HA) has reminded healthcare professionals to be vigilant in early identification of patients for timely diagnosis and management of patients. Its hospitals and clinics have also been reminded to step up mosquito control measures to prevent mosquito breeding. The CHP will continue to work closely and maintain communication with the HA to make timely response. Once a suspected case is detected, the HA will activate the surveillance and notification mechanism and report the case to the CHP immediately.

The DH will continue to step up health education on mosquito-borne diseases, including disseminating travel health advice to travellers and enhancing public education on the prevention of CF through various online and offline channels. The interdepartmental Pest Control Steering Committee will convene a meeting tomorrow (July 23) to review the latest situation of mosquito proliferation and the anti-mosquito work of departments, and to plan for the anti- mosquito work for the future.

Information on CF

The symptoms of CF are similar to those of dengue fever. Patients with CF typically presented with fever and joint pain. Other common symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. While most patients recover on their own, in some cases, joint pain may persist for several months or even years. The mortality rate of CF is generally lower than that of dengue fever. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year. All of which were imported cases. There have been no CF cases in Hong Kong since 2020.

According to the World Health Organization, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. As of early June this year, over 220 000 cases had been reported in 14 countries/regions worldwide (including the Mainland, Taiwan and Singapore which are popular tourist destinations for Hong Kong citizens). Of these cases, about 80 were fatal.

According to the announcement of the Foshan Municipal Health Bureau, as of July 20, there were 2 285 CF confirmed cases in Foshan. The majority of cases (2 158 cases) were in Shunde District, primarily in Lecong, Beijiao and Chencun towns; 69 cases in Chancheng District, primarily in Shiwan Town, Zumiao and Zhangcha Street; and 58 cases in Nanhai District, primarily in Guicheng Street. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases so far. Regarding Macao, the first CF case this year was recorded on July 18. The patient travelled to Shunde during the incubation period and was classified as an imported case."
CHP investigates case of severe paediatric enterovirus infection,2025-07-22 19:45,2025-07-22 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200765.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (July 22) investigating a case of severe paediatric enterovirus (EV) infection, and reminded the public to observe good hand, personal and environmental hygiene.

 The case involves a 5-year-old girl with good past health. She developed fever, headache and vomiting on July 18 and sought medical attention from a private doctor on the following day. On July 21, she was taken to the Accident and Emergency Department of United Christian Hospital and was admitted for treatment. She remains hospitalised.

 A laboratory test of her cerebrospinal fluid specimen was positive for EV. The clinical diagnosis was meningitis.

 Preliminary investigation by the CHP revealed that the patient had travelled to the Mainland with four travel collaterals during the incubation period. One of her travel collaterals developed a cough and runny nose on July 18 and sought medical attention from a private doctor, while the other travel collaterals remained asymptomatic. Her household contacts have remained asymptomatic for the time being. The CHP's investigation is ongoing.

 EV infection is transmitted by direct contact with the nasal and throat secretions of an infected person. Children with EV infection should stay at home until they have recovered to avoid infecting other children. The public should be vigilant and observe the following preventive measures:


Wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet and changing diapers;
Cover mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing;
Maintain good indoor ventilation; and
Thoroughly clean toys or appliances contaminated by nasal or oral secretions.

"Invest Hong Kong hosts seminar to help Mainland companies seize new ""go global"" opportunities through Hong Kong listings (with photos)",2025-07-22 19:44,2025-07-22 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200443.htm,"  Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) today (July 22) hosted a seminar in a hybrid format (both online and offline) to explore how Mainland food and beverage (F&B), retail and creative companies can seize new ""go global"" opportunities by leveraging Hong Kong's strengths as an international financial centre. By listing in Hong Kong, companies can tap into overseas markets and accelerate their global expansion. The event attracted over 110 corporate representatives to participate and received enthusiastic feedback. Participants learned about Hong Kong's unique advantages in supporting global business expansion and expressed strong interest in future opportunities.
  
  Prominent leaders from professional service organisations and corporates, including the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), Deloitte China, and China International Capital Corporation Limited, spoke at the seminar. They provided in-depth insights into Hong Kong's listing process and competitive advantages, discussed financial and tax planning strategies, and explored post-listing international business development opportunities. Representatives from Mainland enterprises already listed in Hong Kong also shared their success stories. They highlighted how they have successfully leveraged Hong Kong's unique advantages to go public and scale into global markets.
  
  In his welcome remarks, Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK Mr Arnold Lau said, ""As an international financial centre, Hong Kong is having the strong support of the country while maintaining unparalleled connectivity with the world under the 'one country, two systems' principle. In the first half of 2025, IPO fundraising in Hong Kong exceeded $107 billion, ranking first globally. Notably, consumer goods, retail, and services accounted for 34 per cent of Main Board listings, reflecting strong market vitality. Over the past two and a half years, Invest Hong Kong has supported more than 1 300 companies in establishing a presence in Hong Kong, bringing in over $160 billion in investment, a clear reflection of international enterprises’ confidence in and recognition of Hong Kong’s business environment. This year marks the 25th anniversary of both Invest Hong Kong and the HKEX. We will continue to work closely together to support enterprises from listing to global expansion, contributing to the nation's dual circulation strategy.""
  
  Vice President, Global Issuer Services of the HKEX, Ms Maria Yuan, provided an introduction of Hong Kong's listing regulations, processes and policies, mapping the route for companies to list in Hong Kong.
  
  During the panel discussion, the Capital Market Services Group (HK) Leader, Southern Region of Deloitte China, Mr Robert Lui, said, ""Hong Kong's mature capital market, stable valuations, and ample liquidity, combined with its simple, low-tax regime, are favourable factors for businesses to build competitive financial and tax structures. For Mainland F&B companies, listing in Hong Kong not only helps boost brand visibility but also leverages the city's pivotal roles as both a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder', accelerating overseas expansion."""

粵港澳三地聯防聯控　加強防控蚊傳疾病基孔肯雅熱,2025-07-22 19:00,2025-07-22 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200734.htm,"就廣東佛山及澳門近期先後錄得基孔肯雅熱個案，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月二十二日）表示，粵港澳三地一直按照行之有效的聯絡溝通機制，對涉及三地的傳染病進行聯防聯控工作。中心會繼續和廣東省、澳門的衞生當局保持緊密聯繫，按照風險評估採取適當的防控措施，預防基孔肯雅熱在本港傳播，保障市民健康。

粵港澳三地聯防聯控

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「粵港澳三地在傳染病防控、緊急應變及聯防聯控等方面一直合作無間。中心根據三地建立的傳染病通報機制，充分掌握廣東省近日基孔肯雅熱的最新情況。雖然本港今年暫時未錄得基孔肯雅熱的確診個案，但隨着夏季氣溫及雨量上升，本港蚊患情況預料會加劇，加上市民在暑假期間會較頻繁外遊，包括前往蚊傳疾病流行的地區，因此出現蚊傳疾病（如基孔肯雅熱、登革熱）輸入個案及本地傳播的風險增加。因此，市民不論在本地或外遊時，都應時刻做好防蚊控蚊及個人保護措施。」

為應對蚊傳疾病輸入風險的措施

徐樂堅醫生補充，為應對蚊傳疾病輸入的風險，中心港口衞生科已在各個口岸加強巡查，確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施，並會為抵港人士進行體溫篩查，為發燒旅客進行健康評估及在有需要時轉介他們到醫院作出跟進。中心亦會與航空公司和旅遊業界等持份者保持緊密聯繫，適時更新疾病資訊和健康建議。

此外，中心已去信全港醫生和醫院，以提供最新流行病學資訊，並呼籲他們留意外遊回港的求診人士是否有基孔肯雅熱相關病徵。如發現病例，應即時轉介病人入院治理，並按既定機制向衞生署呈報，以展開流行病學調查及防控工作。

醫院管理局（醫管局）鑑於鄰近地區近期出現基孔肯雅熱爆發情況，已提醒醫護人員提高警覺，及早識別患者，以便適時診斷和治理病人，並已提醒醫院及診所加強控蚊措施，防止蚊蟲滋生。醫管局會繼續與中心緊密合作和保持溝通，作出適時應變。一旦發現疑似病例，醫管局會啓動監察及通報機制，即時向中心通報個案。

衞生署會繼續加強蚊傳疾病的健康教育工作，包括向旅客發布旅遊健康建議，並會透過線上及線下的不同渠道加強關於預防基孔肯雅熱的公眾教育。政府跨部門防治蟲鼠督導委員會將於明日（七月二十三日）召開會議，檢視蚊患最新情況及各部門的防治蚊患工作，並部署未來的防蚊工作。

基孔肯雅熱的資訊

基孔肯雅熱的病徵與登革熱相似，病人通常會出現發燒和關節痛。其他常見病徵包括肌肉疼痛、頭痛、噁心、疲倦和紅疹。大部分病人可以自行痊癒，但個別病人的關節痛會持續數月甚至數年。基孔肯雅熱的死亡率一般較登革熱為低。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為外地傳入個案，由二○二○年至今，沒有錄得確診基孔肯雅熱的個案。

世界衞生組織的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱個案。截至今年六月初，全球14個國家／地區共錄得超過22萬宗個案（包括內地、台灣、新加坡等香港人的旅遊熱點），當中約80宗為死亡個案。

根據佛山市衞生健康局公布，截至七月二十日，當地錄得2 285宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，絕大部分（2 158宗）出現在順德區，主要集中在樂從鎮、北滘鎮和陳村鎮；另外禪城區有69宗，主要集中在石灣鎮、祖廟和張槎街道；南海區亦有58宗，主要集中在桂城街道。所有患者症狀輕微，暫時沒有錄得嚴重或死亡個案。澳門方面，當局在七月十八日錄得當地今年首宗基孔肯雅熱個案，患者於潛伏期到過順德，被列為輸入個案。"

Hong Kong Customs detects money laundering case involving about $1.15 billion,2025-07-22 18:40,2025-07-22 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200721.htm,"Hong Kong Customs today (July 22) detected a suspected money laundering case involving cash smuggling and virtual assets to launder a total of about $1.15 billion. One local man and one non-local man were arrested.

Acting upon intelligence, Customs officers earlier targeted a 37-year-old local man and a 50-year-old non-local man and initiated a financial investigation. It was revealed that the duo smuggled cash out of Hong Kong, and conducted stablecoin and fiat currency transactions with a doubtful fund source at a frequent and fast pace, which was highly incommensurate with their background and financial status. They were suspected of participating in money laundering activities.

Following in-depth investigations, Customs officers this morning raided four residential premises and two companies and seized a batch of items suspected to be connected with the case, including mobile phones, tablets and bank cards. The two men, who claimed to be self-employed and unemployed respectively, were arrested for ""dealing with property known or reasonably believed to represent proceeds of an indictable offence"" (commonly known as money laundering) under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (OSCO).

An investigation is ongoing. The two arrested persons have been released on bail pending further investigation. The likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

Under OSCO, a person commits an offence if he or she deals with any property knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that such property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and imprisonment for 14 years while the crime proceeds are also subject to confiscation.

Members of the public may report any suspected money laundering activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)."
Government announces implementation of elderly-friendly building design and launches Elderly-friendly Building accreditation scheme,2025-07-22 18:34,2025-07-22 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200594.htm,"The Government announced today (July 22) that the Task Force on Promoting Elderly-friendly Building Design (Task Force) led by the Deputy Financial Secretary, Mr Michael Wong, has formulated the proposals on elderly-friendly building design for implementation in phases starting from the middle of this year. Meanwhile, the Development Bureau (DEVB), in collaboration with the Hong Kong Green Building Council Limited (HKGBC) and the BEAM Society Limited (BSL), has launched a voluntary Elderly-friendly Building accreditation scheme to encourage the industry to adopt the recommended best practices for elderly-friendly building design.

With an ageing population in Hong Kong and to encourage ageing in place, ""The Chief Executive's 2023 Policy Address"" announced that the Deputy Financial Secretary would co-ordinate with relevant bureaux to put forward proposals to promote elderly-friendly building design. The Task Force announced in November last year a series of specific proposals for elderly-friendly building design and consulted the stakeholders. Stakeholders from the elderly, professional, developer and other sectors generally supported the proposals and provided valuable suggestions for refining the design proposals.

Having considered the views of the stakeholders, the Task Force has refined the proposals announced earlier after balancing various factors, including the needs of the elderly and other users, as well as the practical operational considerations in application by the market and the industry. The key requirements of the proposals to be implemented are as follows:

(1) promoting spatial accessibility to enhance the mobility of the elderly, e.g. provision of an automatic door at the main entrance of residential buildings, adopting wider common corridors and wider main doors of individual units, allowing the addition of lift towers to existing buildings, and using slip-resistant materials;
(2) encouraging the adoption of adaptive design in residential units to facilitate subsequent modifications, such as widening internal corridors and doors, using sliding doors for toilets, and installing grab rails/shower seats in bathrooms, etc;
(3) enhancing elderly well-being, e.g. providing fitness or other facilities for the elderly in recreational spaces, and providing shelters for resting facilities at communal outdoor spaces, etc; and
(4) facilitating the adoption of gerontechnology and Internet of Things, e.g. providing high-speed Internet access in home and public spaces, supporting the installation of smart card systems, motion sensors, etc.

âPlease refer to the summary table at the Annex for the detailed proposals.

Apart from new private residential buildings, composite buildings and commercial premises often patronised by the elderly (e.g. shopping complexes and clinics, etc), the above proposals are also applicable to alterations and additions to existing buildings of these building types. As for public housing developments and government buildings, the Government will also endeavor to adhere to the proposals. The proposals comprise both encouraged features and mandatory requirements, and the proposals will be implemented in two phases. For the encouraged features (including promoted features through incentives and the recommended best practices), the Buildings Department (BD) has administratively updated the practice notes and the ""Design Manual: Barrier Free Access"" for implementation. As for the mandatory design requirements, the Government will implement them through amendments to the Building (Planning) Regulations in the first half of 2026.

In addition, to encourage and facilitate the industry to adopt the recommended best practices for elderly-friendly building design, the DEVB, in collaboration with the HKGBC and the BSL, has launched the Elderly-friendly Building accreditation scheme. The scheme is voluntary and applicable to both new and existing buildings. Buildings that have adopted the specified recommended best practices, as assessed by the BSL, are eligible for the Elderly-friendly Building certification issued by the HKGBC. To promote participation in the accreditation scheme, the Elderly-friendly Building certification can be one of the ""specific standards"" for granting gross floor area (GFA) concessions by the BD (Note). In addition, the accreditation scheme also dovetails with the work of the Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy led by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration to promote the development of the silver economy.

The accreditation scheme is open for application from today. Please visit the website (www.beamsociety.org.hk/en/BEAM-Plus/BEAM-Plus-Theme-Certification) for details and to apply (beamplusadmin.my.salesforce-sites.com/), or call 3610 5700 to enquire about the details of the scheme from the BSL.

A Government spokesman said, ""After more than a year's effort, the Task Force on Promoting Elderly-friendly Building Design has formulated the final proposals and accomplished its mission. The Government is grateful to stakeholders for their support in promoting elderly-friendly building design and looks forward to facilitating and encouraging the industry to actively incorporate elderly-friendly building design elements into their buildings according to their own circumstances through various means to support ageing in place and make Hong Kong a livable city recognised by the silver hair market.""

Note: Starting from June 30, 2024, building projects are normally required to attain the ""Anticipated Gold"" rating in the BEAM Plus in order to be eligible for GFA concessions for green/amenity features. If a project can only achieve the ""Anticipated Silver"" or ""Anticipated Bronze"" rating, it has to demonstrate compliance with one or more of the specific standards stipulated by the BD in order to be eligible for GFA concessions. Currently, the specific standards include (a) enhanced greening provision; (b) health and well-being; (c) enhanced natural ventilation; (d) adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in plan submissions; and (e) adoption of multi-trade integrated mechanical, electrical and plumbing in building services (MiMEP)."
公務員事務局局長勉勵政務職系暑期實習生,2025-07-22 18:26,2025-07-22 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200343.htm,"公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵今日（七月二十二日）與50多名正參加政務職系暑期實習計劃的大專學生見面交流、分享經驗，並鼓勵他們投考政務主任等政府職位，以專業知識服務社會，為市民謀福祉，為香港謀發展。

公務員事務局今年安排實習生在不同決策局或部門工作後，按他們所見所聞所想，在多個範疇包括交通、規劃發展、社企、地區事務、銀髮經濟等，分組討論和提交政策倡議，公務員事務局會把這些建議交到派駐實習的決策局或部門供他們參考。

楊何蓓茵於聚會中聆聽實習生分享他們實習期間的工作點滴和政策倡議，並以自己近40年公務員生涯的經歷，分享作為政務主任的寶貴心得，勉勵學生積極充實自己、規劃未來，為國家及香港的發展作貢獻。

她說：「我知道今輪實習計劃接獲的報名人數創新高，吸引了本地、內地以至海外超過300名大專生報名申請。從大家的分享中，我感受到大家對公共服務的熱誠。我希望藉此呼籲有志服務社會、敢於承擔的年輕人積極考慮加入公務員行列。」

「我期待參與實習的同學們在不久將來成為政務主任，以自身所長，服務市民，貢獻國家和香港。」

公務員事務局常任秘書長梁卓文及副秘書長張誼亦特別到場與實習生傾談，聆聽他們分享實習生活和對香港發展的意見。

政務主任是專業的公共行政管理人員，在政府中擔任重要角色，負責協助制定公共政策、統籌和督導各項施政措施、管理公共資源的運用，並推動地區工作及對外宣傳香港等。為讓政務主任在不同公共政策領域中累積經驗、發揮潛能，政務主任會定期調派至各決策局和政府部門工作，擴闊視野，更全面掌握公共行政的各項挑戰與機遇。

公務員事務局每年夏季及冬季均會舉辦政務職系實習計劃，讓有志成為政務主任的學生，有機會與現職政務主任共事約八星期，提早汲取在政府工作的實際經驗，為未來事業發展奠定基礎。過去五年的統計顯示，每五名新入職的政務主任中，其中一人便曾參加政務職系實習計劃。

政府將於今年九月展開新一輪招聘政務主任、二級行政主任、二級助理勞工事務主任、二級助理貿易主任及二級管理參議主任的工作。有意應徵該等職位的人士，須先應考綜合招聘考試及「基本法及香港國安法測試」，以取得所需成績。其中，新一輪綜合招聘考試現正接受申請，有意投考者須於八月一日或之前於網上報名。詳情請參閱公務員事務局網頁（www.csb.gov.hk/tc_chi/index.html）。"
SCS encourages Administrative Service summer interns,2025-07-22 18:26,2025-07-22 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200523.htm,"  The Secretary for the Civil Service, Mrs Ingrid Yeung, met and shared experiences with over 50 tertiary students participating in the Administrative Service Summer Internship Programme today (July 22). She encouraged them to apply for civil service positions such as the Administrative Officer (AO) post, and to use their professional knowledge to serve the community, benefit people's livelihood and contribute to the development of Hong Kong.

  This year, the Civil Service Bureau (CSB) has arranged for the interns to discuss and submit policy proposals in various areas including transport, planning and development, social enterprises, district affairs, the silver economy, etc, based on their observations and insights gained after working in different bureaux or departments. The CSB will submit these proposals to the bureaux or departments where the interns were assigned to for their reference.

  At the gathering, Mrs Yeung listened to the sharing by interns on both their work experiences and proposed policy initiatives during their internships. Drawing on her nearly 40 years of service in the civil service, she shared valuable insights as an AO and encouraged students to actively enrich themselves, plan ahead for their future and contribute to the development of the country and Hong Kong.

  She said, ""I am aware that this round of the Programme has received a record number of applications, attracting more than 300 applications from tertiarystudents in Hong Kong, mainland China and overseas. From your sharing, I can genuinely feel your passion for public service. I would like to take this opportunity to call on young people who are dedicated to serve the community and willing to take on responsibilities to join the civil service.

  ""I look forward to interns becoming AOs in the near future, serving the public and contributing to the country and Hong Kong with your own strengths and talents.""

  The Permanent Secretary for the Civil Service, Mr Clement Leung, and Deputy Secretary for the Civil Service Ms Eureka Cheung also joined the sharing session and spoke with interns to learn about their internship experiences and views on Hong Kong's development.

  AOs are professional public administrators who play a pivotal role in the Government. They are responsible for assisting in the formulation of government policies, co-ordinating and supervising various initiatives, managing the use of public resources, promoting district work and publicising Hong Kong externally, etc. To enable AOs to accumulate experience and unleash their full potential in different public policy areas, they are posted to various bureaux and departments at regular intervals, broadening their horizons and gaining a fuller grasp of the challenges and opportunities in public administration.

  The CSB organises the Administrative Service Internship Programme every summer and winter, offering students who aspire to become AOs opportunities to work alongside serving AOs for around eight weeks to gain early practical experiences in public service and lay a solid foundation for their future career development. Statistics from the past five years show that around one in every five newly recruited AOs had participated in the Programme.

  The Government will launch a new round of recruitment for the posts of Administrative Officer, Executive Officer II, Assistant Labour Officer II, Assistant Trade Officer II and Management Services Officer II in September this year. Prospective applicants must first take the Common Recruitment Examination (CRE) and the Basic Law and National Security Law Test to attain the requisite scores. The new round of the CRE is currently open for application. Interested candidates are required to apply online by August 1. For details, please refer to the CSB website (www.csb.gov.hk/english/index.html)."

政府公布落實長者友善樓宇設計和推出「長者友善樓宇」認證計劃,2025-07-22 17:38,2025-07-22 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200588.htm,"​政府今日（七月二十二日）公布，由財政司副司長黃偉綸領導的「推動長者友善樓宇設計」工作組已完成制訂長者友善樓宇設計的方案，由今年中起分批落實。同時，發展局與香港綠色建築議會及建築環保評估協會合作，推出自願性「長者友善樓宇」認證計劃，鼓勵業界採用長者友善樓宇設計的建議作業範例。

隨着香港人口高齡化，為鼓勵居家安老，《行政長官2023年施政報告》宣布，由財政司副司長統籌相關政策局，制定有關推動長者友善樓宇設計的建議。工作組於去年十一月公布一系列長者友善樓宇設計的具體建議，並諮詢持份者。來自安老、發展專業和發展商等界別的持份者普遍支持建議，並就優化設計建議提出寶貴意見。

經考慮持份者的意見後，工作組在平衡各方面因素，包括長者和其他使用者的需要，以及市場和業界的實際應用考慮後，就早前公布的建議作出了微調，將落實的方案主要內容如下：

（一）促進空間通達性，提高長者的行動能力，例如在住宅樓宇正門提供自動門、採用較寬闊的公用走廊和住宅單位大門、容許於現有建築物加建升降機塔、使用防滑物料等；
​（二）鼓勵住宅單位採用靈活彈性的設計，方便將來改裝，例如加闊室內走廊和門、採用趟門洗手間、浴室內裝設扶手╱淋浴座椅等；
​（三）提升長者幸福感，例如在休憩空間為長者提供健身或其他設施、在戶外公用地方設置休憩設施的遮蓋等；以及
​（四）便利採用樂齡科技和物聯網，例如在家居和公共地方提供高速的互聯網服務，支援安裝智慧卡系統、活動感應器等。

方案詳情可參閱載於附件的一覽表。

上述方案除適用於新建的私人住宅樓宇、商住樓宇和長者經常出入的商業處所（例如商場及診所等）外，亦適用於這些類別的現存樓宇的改建及加建工程。至於公營房屋和政府建築物，政府也會致力按方案行事。方案包含鼓勵性設計元素和強制性規定，將分兩階段實施建議。就鼓勵性設計元素（包括透過誘因推廣的設計元素和建議作業範例）方面，屋宇署已以行政方式更新作業備考及《設計手冊：暢通無阻的通道》予以實施。至於強制性設計規定方面，政府會於二○二六年上半年透過修訂《建築物（規劃）規例》實施。

此外，為鼓勵和推動業界採用長者友善樓宇設計的建議作業範例，發展局與香港綠色建築議會和建築環保評估協會合作，推出「長者友善樓宇」認證計劃。計劃屬自願性質，適用於新建和現存樓宇，若申請樓宇能採用指定的建議作業範例，經由建築環保評估協會評估後，便可獲得由香港綠色建築議會頒發的「長者友善樓宇」認證。為推廣參與認證計劃，有關「長者友善樓宇」認證亦可作為屋宇署批予總樓面面積寬免的其中一項「特定標準」（註）。此外，認證計劃亦與政務司副司長領導的促進銀髮經濟工作組的工作相輔相成，以促進銀髮經濟發展。

認證計劃今日起接受申請，可瀏覽網頁（www.beamsociety.org.hk/zh-HK/beam-plus/beam-plus-theme-certification）了解詳情及申請（beamplusadmin.my.salesforce-sites.com/），亦可致電36105700向建築環保評估協會查詢計劃詳情。

政府發言人表示：「經過一年多的努力，『推動長者友善樓宇設計』工作組已制訂最終方案並完成任務。政府感謝持份者對推動長者友善樓宇設計的支持，並期望通過不同方式，促使及鼓勵業界按其實際情況，積極把長者友善樓宇設計元素融入構築物中，支援居家安老，讓香港成為銀髮一族公認的宜居城巿。」

註：由二○二四年六月三十日起，建築項目一般須在「綠建環評」中獲得預期金級的評級，方合資格就環保及適意設施獲批予總樓面面積寬免。如項目只能獲得預期銀級或銅級，則須證明符合屋宇署訂明的一項或以上「特定標準」，方合資格獲批予總樓面面積寬免。現時「特定標準」包括（a）加強綠化；（b）健康生活元素；（c）加強自然通風；（d）採用建築信息模擬技術（BIM）呈交圖則；以及（e）使用機電裝備合成法（MiMEP）。"

尊敬的劉懋洲一級巡視員（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室（中聯辦）教育科技部一級巡視員）、蔡冠深會長（香港中華總商會會長）、李慧琼議員（憲法和基本法推廣督導委員會愛國主義教育工作小組組長、立法會議員）、沈鳳君常任秘書長（文化體育及旅遊局常任秘書長）、各位嘉賓、各位青年朋友：

大家好！今天很高興來到香港科學館，參與「少年太空人體驗營2025」的出發儀式，同各位一齊見證30位中學生成為新一屆「少年太空人」，即將前往內地認識國家在航天科技的驕人成就。

自二○○九年起，康樂及文化事務署聯同香港中華總商會舉辦「少年太空人體驗營」，並得到總商會的全力贊助。多年來，這個活動讓接近400名學生到訪國家的航天基地，親身了解國家航天科技的高度發展，更有機會與航天專家和航天員見面學習。

如往年一樣，今年體驗營的選拔過程競爭激烈，有超過80間學校、約120位同學報名參加。今日在座的30位同學均是經過三輪嚴格選拔，才能夠脫穎而出成為「少年太空人」。我希望大家好好珍惜國家為你們提供的這個寶貴的、極難得的機會。這個體驗營不僅是你們對航天體驗的開始，更是開啓你們夢想旅程的第一步。

國家航天事業的飛躍發展，令人振奮。去年，中國科學院、國家航天局、中國載人航天工程辦公室聯合發布了《國家空間科學中長期發展規劃（2024—2050年）》，當中提出在二○三六至二○五○年，中國空間科學重要領域將達到世界領先水平。單在今年，國家在這個領域已有不同突破：今年四月恰逢第十個中國航天日及神舟二十號載人飛船成功發射；天問二號探測器自五月底升空，正前往一顆小行星進行探測與採樣任務；以及國家自主研發的大型民航客機C919，已在年初開通來往香港和上海的定期航班。這些都是國家航天科技人才努力不懈開創出來的成果。

近年香港的科研團隊在國家的支持下，積極參與國家的太空探索任務，例如：去年六月，香港特區首次有市民獲選為預備航天員，成為國家載人航天工程的載荷專家；以及香港理工大學的科研團隊為嫦娥四號、五號和六號的探月任務，進行研發和提供了技術支援，當中包括與中國空間技術研究院合作，研製了「表取採樣執行裝置」，協助嫦娥六號完成人類史上首次月球背面表土採樣任務。香港能為國家航天任務貢獻自身力量，實在是我們的榮幸；同時亦激勵我們要繼續做好航天創科教育，培育科研人才，把香港建設成為具影響力的國際創科中心。

在這裏，我想向大家劇透一下：八月一日，在我們身處的科學館將會舉行一個介紹國家航天、航空及航海領域科技成就的專題展覽。市民可以見證到國家憑着創新精神和攻堅壯志，在這些領域如何攀上世界領先地位。

最後，我衷心感謝香港中華總商會、中國載人航天工程辦公室、中聯辦及京港學術交流中心，對「少年太空人體驗營」的鼎力支持。我希望各位「少年太空人」把握這個彌足珍貴的受訓機會，親身感受國家航天事業的輝煌成就，以航天英雄為榜樣，將來成為推動國家航天事業發展的寶貴力量。多謝大家。"

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（七月二十二日）宣布，已根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（香港法例第584章）（《支付條例》）完成對三三金融服務有限公司（三三金融）的調查及紀律處分程序。金融管理專員對三三金融違反《支付條例》第8Q條，未能符合其附表3第2部第6（2）（b）條的最低準則，處以譴責及1,600,000港元罰款。

是次紀律處分行動（註一）是根據金管局的調查結果而作出。調查發現三三金融在二○一九年十二月一日至二○二三年八月三十一日期間未有制定健全及適當的管控制度，以遵守《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引》（儲值支付工具持牌人適用）（《指引》）的有關段落（註二）。

是次違規涉及三三金融的管控制度在以下三個範疇的缺失：


索取足夠資料以了解與客戶建立業務關係的目的，及其預期性質；
對個人客戶所代表的法團進行客戶盡職審查措施；以及
確保三三金融的業務合作夥伴，作為其外判實體，按照其內部要求對客戶妥善進行身份識別和核實，以及作出紀錄。


在決定上述的紀律處分行動時，金融管理專員已考慮有關情況及因素，包括：


調查結果的嚴重性，以及三三金融過往已有與《支付條例》相關的紀律處分紀錄；
需要向業界傳遞明確的阻嚇訊息，以表明有效管控措施及程序在應對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險方面的重要性；
三三金融在得悉金管局所指出的缺失後已採取補救措施，並加強其管控制度；以及
三三金融以合作態度解決金管局的關注事項。


金管局助理總裁（法規及打擊清洗黑錢）陳景宏表示：「客戶盡職審查措施對打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集尤其重要。核實客戶身份和了解業務關係的目的及其預期性質，為客戶盡職審查措施的重要元素，而儲值支付工具持牌人應確保已建立有效的相關措施。」

Monetary Authority takes disciplinary action against 33 Financial Services Limited for contravention of Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance,2025-07-22 17:07,2025-07-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200331.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (July 22) that it had completed an investigation and disciplinary proceedings for 33 Financial Services Limited (33FS) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (Chapter 584 of the Laws of Hong Kong) (PSSVFO). The Monetary Authority (MA) has reprimanded and ordered 33FS to pay a pecuniary penalty of HK$1,600,000 for contravening section 8Q of the PSSVFO as it failed to fulfil the minimum criterion under section 6(2)(b) of Part 2 of Schedule 3 to the PSSVFO.

The disciplinary action (Note 1) follows an investigation by the HKMA which found that, during the period from December 1, 2019 to August 31, 2023, 33FS failed to have in place adequate and appropriate systems of control to comply with the relevant paragraphs of the Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (For Stored Value Facility (SVF) Licensees) (Guideline) (Note 2).

Specifically, the contravention relates to deficiencies in 33FS' systems of control in three areas, namely:


obtaining sufficient information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationships with customers;
carrying out customer due diligence (CDD) measures on the business entities of which the individual customers acted on behalf; and
ensuring the identification and verification of identity of customers was properly performed and documented by its business partners, which were acting as outsourced entities for 33FS, in accordance with its internal requirement.


  In deciding the disciplinary action, the MA has taken into account the relevant circumstances and factors, including:


the seriousness of the investigation findings as well as the fact that 33FS has previous disciplinary record in respect of the PSSVFO;
the need to send a clear deterrent message to the industry about the importance of effective controls and procedures to address money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risks;
33FS has taken remedial measures to address the deficiencies identified by the HKMA and enhance its systems of control; and
33FS is co-operative in resolving concerns identified by the HKMA.


  The Executive Director (Enforcement and AML) of the HKMA, Mr Raymond Chan,said, ""CDD measures are crucial for combatting ML and TF risks. Verifying the identity of customers and understanding the purpose and intended nature of the business relationships are essential elements of CDD measures. SVF licensees should ensure that they have effective CDD measures in place.""

​金融管理專員對三家銀行違反《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》採取紀律處分行動,2025-07-22 17:05,2025-07-22 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200317.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（七月二十二日）宣布，已根據《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》（香港法例第615章）（《打擊洗錢條例》）完成對三家銀行的調查及紀律處分程序。三家銀行分別為Indian Overseas Bank, Hong Kong Branch（IOBHK）、交通銀行（香港）有限公司（交銀（香港））及交通銀行股份有限公司香港分行（交銀香港分行）。

金融管理專員：（i）譴責IOBHK；（ii）命令IOBHK就過往的交易進行回顧檢討，以及制定並落實補救措施，以糾正其違反事項；及（iii）對IOBHK處以8,500,000港元罰款。此外，金融管理專員對交銀（香港）處以4,000,000港元罰款和對交銀香港分行處以3,700,000港元罰款。金融管理專員對上述三家銀行所採取的紀律處分行動之詳情載於隨附各自的紀律處分行動聲明。

是次紀律處分行動（註）是金管局對上述銀行就《打擊洗錢條例》所設立的制度及管控措施的合規情況進行調查後而作出的。調查發現三家銀行未有設立及維持有效措施以持續監察與客戶的業務關係。

IOBHK的交易監察機制和管理層對打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施的監察存在重大缺失。

交銀（香港）及交銀香港分行的違反事項源於兩家銀行未有將某些類別的交易載入至兩家銀行共用的交易監察系統，削弱了該系統識別可疑活動的效用。

在決定上述紀律處分行動時，金融管理專員已考慮有關情況及因素，包括：


調查結果的嚴重性；
需要向上述三家銀行及業界傳遞明確的阻嚇訊息，以表明有效的管控措施及程序在應對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險方面的重要性；
有關銀行已就發現的缺失採取補救措施（如適用）；及
上述三家銀行過往並無與《打擊洗錢條例》相關的紀律處分紀錄，並在金管局的調查及執法程序中表現合作。


金管局助理總裁（法規及打擊清洗黑錢）陳景宏表示：「有效的交易監察措施讓銀行能及時識別和舉報可疑交易，因此是銀行打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施中的重要一環。銀行管理層應確保銀行備有妥善的交易監察系統及流程，並在發現缺失時迅速糾正。」

Monetary Authority takes disciplinary actions against three banks for contraventions of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance,2025-07-22 17:05,2025-07-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200318.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (July 22) that it had completed investigations and disciplinary proceedings under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Chapter 615 of the Laws of Hong Kong) (AMLO) in relation to three banks: Indian Overseas Bank, Hong Kong Branch (IOBHK), Bank of Communications (Hong Kong) Limited (BCOM(HK)) and Bank of Communications Co., Ltd., Hong Kong Branch (BCOM Hong Kong Branch).

The Monetary Authority (MA) has: (i) reprimanded IOBHK; (ii) ordered IOBHK to conduct a look-back review of past transactions, and develop and implement a remedial plan to address the contraventions; and (iii) imposed a pecuniary penalty of HK$8,500,000 on IOBHK. Separately, the MA has imposed pecuniary penalties of HK$4,000,000 on BCOM(HK) and HK$3,700,000 on BCOM Hong Kong Branch. Details of the disciplinary actions against each of the three banks are set out in the respective Statements of Disciplinary Action attached.

The disciplinary actions (Note) follow investigations by the HKMA into the banks' systems and controls for compliance with the AMLO. The control deficiencies identified related to failures to establish and maintain effective procedures for continuously monitoring business relationships with customers.

There were significant deficiencies in IOBHK's transaction monitoring mechanism and management oversight of the bank's anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) controls.

The contraventions of BCOM(HK) and BCOM Hong Kong Branch arose from omissions to load certain types of transactions into the transaction monitoring system shared by the two banks, undermining the system's effectiveness in identifying potentially suspicious activities.

In deciding the disciplinary actions, the MA has taken into account the relevant circumstances and factors, including:


the seriousness of the investigation findings;
the need to send a clear deterrent message to the three banks and the industry about the importance of having effective controls and procedures to address money laundering and terrorist financing risks;
where applicable, the remedial measures taken by the banks to address the deficiencies identified; and
the three banks have no previous disciplinary record in relation to the AMLO and co-operated with the HKMA during the investigations and enforcement proceedings.


The Executive Director (Enforcement and AML) of the HKMA, Mr Raymond Chan,said, ""Effective transaction monitoring enables timely identification and reporting of suspicious transactions and thus is an essential component of banks' AML/CFT controls. Bank management should ensure that proper transaction monitoring systems and processes are in place and any identified deficiencies are addressed promptly.""

The MA is the relevant authority for authorized institutions under the AMLO."

The product information is as follows:

Name: Ten Respiratory Pathogens Antigen Test Kit
Supplier: SAVEWO Distribution Limited
Manufacturer: Anhui Deepblue Medical Technology Co., Ltd
Model number: RP1011N-1
Lot numbers: 20250301 and 20250501

According to information provided by the supplier in Hong Kong, the product in question is an all-in-one test for 10 types of respiratory pathogens, including influenza, COVID-19 and H5N1 avian influenza. It has been distributed in the local retail market since March this year. Following internal testing, the manufacturer has updated the IFU to state that if the H5N1 detection zone is positive but the FIuA+B/COV detection zone is negative, the H5N1 avian influenza test result is invalid.

The supplier has uploaded the updated IFU to its official website. Members of the public who have purchased the affected batch of products are advised to contact the supplierat 5503 2370 if they have any queries regarding their RAT test results.

The product concerned is a Class C (moderate-high risk) In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device and is not listed under the DH's Medical Device Administrative Control System (MDACS).

The DH reminded members of the public that all RATs have limitations, including the possibility of false negative or false positive results. Therefore, RAT test results can only be used for reference purposes and cannot replace the professional diagnosis by doctors. Members of the public should consult healthcare professionals if they have doubts about the results of RATs.

Separately, the DH has introduced a voluntary MDACS, under which a listing system for medical devices and traders, as well as a post-market monitoring system, is in place to ensure that medical devices supplied in Hong Kong meet the safety, quality and performance requirements. Information on listed medical devices is uploaded to the website of the DH's Medical Device Division (www.mdd.gov.hk/en/mdacs/search-database/list-md/index.html). The DH advised members of the public to purchase medical devices listed under the MDACS wherever possible to ensure that the products meet the standards on safety, quality and performance.

The DHwill continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action."

日本進口水產的檢測情況,2025-07-22 15:22,2025-07-22 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200512.htm,"因應日本政府單方面決定把福島核電站核污水排放大海，食物環境衞生署署長已發出《食物安全命令》，禁止源自日本10（都）縣的水產、海鹽和海藻食品進口本港，受禁（都）縣包括東京、福島、茨城、宮城、千葉、群馬、栃木、新潟、長野和埼玉。

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由七月二十一日中午截至今日（七月二十二日）中午，食安中心已對38個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

同期，漁農自然護理署（漁護署）已對50個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。詳情可參閱漁護署網頁（www.afcd.gov.hk/tc_chi/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html）。

香港天文台亦已加強監測本港水域的環境輻射水平。至目前為止，並沒有發現異常情況。詳情可參閱香港天文台的網頁（www.hko.gov.hk/tc/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html）。

由二○二三年八月二十四日起至今日中午，食安中心及漁護署分別檢測了共152 600個日本進口食物樣本（包括100 059個水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽樣本）及共34 694個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。"

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on July 21 to noon today (July 22), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 38 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 152 600 samples of food imported from Japan (including 100 059 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 34 694 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

  An IRD spokesman said, ""The IRD is committed to promoting tax digitalisation and has been upgrading electronic tax services to provide convenience to taxpayers and enhance the efficiency, reliability and accuracy of return filing. The three new tax portals provide electronic tax services to individuals, businesses, and tax service agents respectively, allowing them to handle tax matters conveniently and efficiently.""

  The ITP offers a centralised platform for users to manage their personal tax matters, providing functions such as tax return filing, personal particulars updates and viewing of tax positions. Individual users may also use the ITP on their mobile devices anytime, anywhere via the ""eTAX"" mobile application launched by the IRD today.

  The BTP is specifically designed for businesses to handle tax matters and compliance obligations electronically, including tax return filing and business registration.

  The TRP caters to tax service agents (tax representatives, company secretaries and other tax service providers) to facilitate them in managing clients' tax matters, including tax return filing and compliance tracking.

  ""Profiles of existing eTAX users have been migrated to the ITP. They can use their registered information to log into the ITP. Businesses and service agents are encouraged to open an eTAX account as early as possible to handle tax matters electronically through the BTP and TRP in a safe, convenient and environmentally friendly way,"" the spokesman said.

  Details about the three new tax portals are available on the IRD's website."

蕭德威先生（美心集團首席營運官（香港及澳門））、陳文宜女士（香港社會服務聯會（社聯）行政總裁）、蔡碧林女士（信和集團資產管理董事）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。今日很高興出席「軟心膳x照護食種子餐廳暨社區推動計劃」啟動禮。我感謝美心集團積極製造軟餐，並聯同多間機構及團體進行推廣，致力照顧長者的需要，同時響應政府推動銀髮經濟的政策。

行政長官去年在《施政報告》提出成立促進銀髮經濟工作組，從五大範疇促進銀髮經濟的發展。今年五月，工作組公布了30項措施，其中多項與商經局推動銀髮友善飲食有關，包括聯同社聯支援商界推廣「照護食」、推動食品製造業界提供迎合長者需要及喜好的預先包裝食品等；同時透過「老友記‧食好啲」活動，帶動飲食業界提供適合長者的餐膳體驗和飲食優惠。

我很高興見到，在商經局的推動下，商界積極探索銀髮一族的需要和喜好，相繼參考社聯的《照護食標準指引》將現有菜式轉化成軟餐版本，或自主研發，推出「照護食」軟餐的選擇，並籌備一連串推廣活動，將軟餐的概念在社區廣泛宣傳。

我衷心感謝美心迅速響應政府推動銀髮經濟的政策。除了推出包括中式點心拼盤及西式套餐的軟餐品牌之外，更多走幾步，在社區與不同有心的機構進行宣傳，為長者提供安全且優質的用餐選擇。

例如美心早前聯同煤氣公司及香港聖公會福利協會，免費供應近萬份軟餐給護老院舍的長者享用，並安排言語治療師為他們評估吞嚥能力。另外，集團將會額外提供5 000份免費試食，惠及更多長者，並加入社聯的「照護食種子餐廳」計劃，以及在旗下多間酒樓和食肆提供堂食服務，進一步滿足長者的日常飲食需求。同時，美心將與信和集團及關愛隊合作，進行吞嚥評估和推廣「照護食」的工作，致力發展吞嚥友善的飲食文化。

各位，銀髮經濟市場龐大，消費群體不只本地的老友記，更包括內地、亞洲各地，甚至歐美的年長旅客。發展銀髮經濟不僅關乎本地長者的福祉，更有助吸引長者旅客來港消費和用餐，有利商界拓展顧客群。此外，我感謝社會各界積極響應工作組的呼籲，與商界協作，透過提供適老產品的技術支援、專業培訓和顧問服務，以及共享業務網絡等多項惠及銀髮一族的措施，把握銀髮經濟帶來的機遇，共同努力提升銀髮一族的生活質量及推動本港經濟發展。

最後，我預祝本計劃圓滿成功，亦希望更多食肆及餐飲機構把握銀髮商機，積極推出軟餐和大力宣傳，讓長者重拾出外享用美食的樂趣，為本港經濟注入活力及帶動經濟發展。多謝大家。"

最後，我預祝本計劃圓滿成功，亦希望更多食肆及餐飲機構把握銀髮商機，積極推出軟餐和大力宣傳，讓長者重拾出外享用美食的樂趣，為本港經濟注入活力及帶動經濟發展。多謝大家。"

Special traffic and transport arrangements for football matches and training sessions at Kai Tak Sports Park and Hong Kong Stadium between July 24 and 31,2025-07-22 09:42,2025-07-22 10:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200201.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (July 22) said that, to facilitate the holding of football matches and training sessions on specific dates in designated venues between July 24 and 31, the following special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented in the vicinity of the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) and the Hong Kong Stadium (HKS) to provide convenience for spectators to travel to and from the venues:

Open training sessions

Prior to the matches, open training sessions of the football clubs will be held at the KTSP around the evening of July 24, 29 and 30 and the HKS on the evening of July 25.

As the dispersal time of the events will fall within the evening peak hours, the MTR will enhance the service headway of the Tuen Ma Line (TML) and the Island Line on respective days as needed to meet the passenger demand. The Police will implement temporary road closure and traffic diversion measures in the vicinity of the KTSP (depending on actual traffic and crowd conditions) and the HKS. Members of the public should heed advice from on-site police.

Football matches

  Football matches will be held on the evening of July 26 and 31 at the KTSP. As the traffic in the vicinity is expected to be heavy, spectators should opt for public transport and avoid taking private cars (including cross-boundary private cars).

  The TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators (PTOs) to strengthen their services during dispersal. The MTR will enhance the interval between trains of the TML. Franchised bus companies will provide a total of 11 special bus routes at the Sung Wong Toi Road Pick-up/Drop-off Area (PUDOA) to Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange (PTI), the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Hong Kong Port and Airport, and major districts across the territory.

  In addition, the KTSP will arrange cross-boundary coach services during dispersal to facilitate travellers' return to the Mainland via the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang (LMC/HG) Port, the HZMB and the Shenzhen Bay Port. Passengers should purchase tickets in advance. On-site ticket sales will not be available during dispersal. They should refer to the operators' website (Eternal East Bus: www.myeebus.com/eebusfans; CTG Bus: m.hkctgbus.com/#/layout/home) for the latest ticket information.

  For taxi services, the Kai Tak Stadium Taxi PUDOA will be open for taxi pick-up and drop-off. The Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA will be open for taxi drop-off only during admission (4pm to 7.30pm) and suspended from taxi pick-up/drop-off during dispersal. The expected waiting time will be longer amid an outflux of spectators and passengers' patience is appreciated.

  Spectators who plan to return to the Mainland on the same day after the matches should pay special attention that, if they use the Lo Wu Control Point, they should catch the last relevant MTR TML train departing from Sung Wong Toi Station at 10.59pm and Kai Tak Station at 11.01pm, followed by interchanging at Tai Wai Station on the East Rail Line (ERL) to Lo Wu Station. Travellers should plan their journeys ahead and arrive at the station platform in advance.

  Travellers who opt for LMC/HG Port (operating 24 hours daily) may also take the ERL to Sheung Shui Station and then the KMB route No. 276B or N73, or take the special bus route No. SP12 directly at the Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA to the Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) PTI, and transfer to the LMC-HG cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) for their journey to the Mainland.

For details of the special traffic and transport arrangements, members of the public may refer to the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk), the ""HKeMobility"" mobile application or passenger notices issued by PTOs as well as the latest traffic news through radio and television broadcasts.

公開訓練

賽前，各球會將於七月二十四、二十九及三十日傍晚前後在啟德體育園，以及七月二十五日傍晚在香港大球場舉行公開訓練。

由於活動的離場時段為下午繁忙時間，港鐵將按需要於相關日子加密屯馬綫及港島綫的班次，應對乘客需求。警方會於啟德體育園（視乎實際交通及人潮情況）和香港大球場附近地區實施臨時封路及改道措施，市民請遵從現場警務人員的指示。

足球賽事

足球賽事將於七月二十六及三十一日晚上在啟德體育園舉行。附近一帶的交通預期會較繁忙，觀眾應乘搭公共交通工具，避免使用私家車（包括跨境私家車）前往。

運輸署已協調本地及跨境公共運輸服務營辦商在離場時段加強服務。港鐵將會加密屯馬綫的班次，專營巴士公司將於宋皇臺道上落客區提供共11條特別巴士路線分別前往落馬洲（新田）公共運輸交匯處、港珠澳大橋香港口岸和機場及港九新界各主要地區。

另外，園方將於離場時段安排跨境巴士服務，便利旅客經落馬洲／皇崗口岸、港珠澳大橋和深圳灣口岸返回內地。乘客需預先購票，離場後現場不設售票。票務詳情以營辦商網頁為準：永東直巴（www.myeebus.com/eebusfans）；中旅巴士（m.hkctgbus.com/#/layout/home）。

至於的士服務，啟德主場館的士上落客區將開放予的士上落客。宋皇臺道上落客區在進場時段（下午四時至七時三十分）只開放予的士落客，離場時段則暫停的士上落客。由於預計離場人士眾多，輪候時間會較長，請耐心輪候登車。

計劃在賽事完結後即日返回內地的觀眾需特別注意，如經羅湖口岸過關，需趕及港鐵屯馬綫最後一班相關列車，即於晚上十時五十九分由宋皇臺站及十一時○一分由啟德站開出的列車，並於大圍站轉乘東鐵綫往羅湖站。旅客應妥善規劃行程，提前前往車站月台。

使用落馬洲／皇崗口岸（全日24小時通關）過關的旅客，亦可乘搭東鐵綫往上水站轉乘九巴第276B或N73號線，或直接在宋皇臺道上落客區乘搭特別巴士第SP12號線往落馬洲（新田）公共運輸交匯處，轉乘落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）返回內地。

Development Bureau announces latest arrangements for two industry sites in Yuen Long and Hung Shui Kiu ,2025-07-21 20:31,2025-07-21 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/21/P2025072100910.htm,"The Development Bureau (DEVB) announced today (July 21) that in order to strengthen the Government's leading role and accelerate the anchoring of industries in the Northern Metropolis (NM), the Government has decided to cancel the tender for two sites in Yuen Long and Hung Shui Kiu. This facilitates efficient implementation of more pragmatic arrangements for the two industry sites, which include:


Handing over the site at Yuen Long Fuk Wang Street and Wang Lee Street (i.e. Yuen Long Town Lot No. 545) (the Yuen Long Lot) to the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC), with a view to establishing a microelectronics ecosystem in the Yuen Long InnoPark and better promoting high value-added new industrialisation; and




Incorporating the site at Area 39A and 39B, Hung Shui Kiu and Ha Tsuen (i.e. Hung Shui Kiu Town Lot No. 10) (the Hung Shui Kiu Lot) in a policy study to be completed by the DEVB within this year, which involves a larger area of land. The aim is for a company established by the Government to take up the management and operation for the industry sites in that area in the form of an industry park.


  The DEVB launched tenders under the two-envelope approach for the Yuen Long Lot and the Hung Shui Kiu Lot in March and October 2024 respectively for the development of multi-storey buildings for modern industries (MSBs). Part of the floor space of the MSBs was to be leased to the Government at nominal rent for 10 years, allowing the Government to further rent out the floor space at concessionary rents to brownfield operators affected by government development projects during the period. The tender invitation for the two sites was originally to close on July 25, 2025.

A spokesperson for the DEVB said, ""In order to lead and effectively promote the development of industries in the NM, the Government has to allow flexibility in the use of land in the NM and adopt a 'dynamic planning' approach in formulating strategies in accordance with the actual circumstances, thereby accelerating enterprise anchoring and fostering development of the area. Taking into account the views of the innovation and technology sector and the logistics sector on the industry development strategy in the area, as well as the Government's planning strategy for the NM, the Government has decided to cancel the tender for the two sites and proactively utilise the sites according to the Government's development strategy. This would allow the greater play of the sites in promoting industry development.""

The 3-hectare Yuen Long Lot is situated within the vicinity of the Yuen Long InnoPark and the Microelectronics Centre therein. The Yuen Long InnoPark is operated and managed by the HKSTPC. To cater for the HKSTPC's plan to establish a vibrant microelectronics ecosystem within the Yuen Long InnoPark, the Government has seized the opportunity to convert the Yuen Long Lot to innovation and technology use. The Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau will further discuss with the HKSTPC to draw up a concrete development proposal.

On the other hand, as announced in the 2024 Policy Address, the DEVB has been exploring the establishment of a company led by the Government to build and operate an industrial park, involving some of the logistics sites in Hung Shui Kiu. The study will cover around 15 hectares of industry sites situated in the northern part of Hung Shui Kiu, and the 8-hectare Hung Shui Kiu Lot is exactly adjacent to this 15-hectare area of industry land. Incorporating the Hung Shui Kiu Lot in the study will endow the industry park company with more ample land resources to achieve economies of scale in the future. The study will look into the approach for granting such industry sites to the proposed company to be established by the Government, which will be responsible for building and operating the industry park in accordance with the Government's industry policies, as well as attracting enterprises through flexible land grant arrangement and investment promotion measures. We will also explore the option of having the company to designate part of the land within the industry park for developing industrial spaces using low-cost technologies (such as modular construction) within a short period of time to accommodate some of the brownfield operators affected by government development projects. The DEVB will complete the study within this year and subsequently commence the work for the establishment of the company.

The locations of the two sites are shown in the Annex."
