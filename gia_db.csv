​政府各部門全力應對暴雨對本港造成的影響,2025-08-05 17:16,2025-08-05 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500721.htm,"政府發言人今日（八月五日）表示，本港廣泛地區持續受到暴雨影響，多區出現水浸及山泥傾瀉，各相關部門迅速應對，全力將暴雨影響減至最低。

自昨晚（八月四日）深夜起，政府的緊急事故監察及支援中心一直持續運作，由各相關部門的首長級人員實時密切監察全港市面的情況，迅速作出協調應變及行動，嚴陣以待並高效統籌協調各政府部門全力出動，處理水浸、山泥傾瀉、塌樹和道路阻塞等情況，致力減低惡劣天氣對市民的影響。

渠務署一直與天文台保持密切聯繫並作好準備，於昨晚十時三十五分啓動緊急事故控制中心，並派出緊急應變隊伍主動巡查過去容易水浸的地點，包括柴灣及黃大仙。由於持續暴雨，多個地方出現水浸，渠務署共派出180隊緊急應變隊伍，動用約620人及多部強力排水機械人，包括三部「龍吸水」，與其他政府工務部門緊密合作，在全港各區處理水浸個案及清理渠道。至今日下午三時，已確認29個水浸個案，並完成處理其中24個個案及清除水浸，當中包括瑪麗醫院的水浸個案，受水浸影響的道路亦得以大致回復正常運作。渠務署緊急應變隊伍正全力處理餘下地點的水浸個案。

土力工程處亦於天文台發出山泥傾瀉警告後，迅速啓動緊急控制中心。截至今日下午二時三十分，土力工程處接獲共15宗位於西貢、大埔、葵涌、大嶼山、南區、半山、灣仔、沙田及坪洲等地區的山泥傾瀉報告；已安排人員視察山泥傾瀉事故地點，並已聯絡相關部門安排所需的斜坡緊急工程。

在暴雨警告信號期間，消防處截至今日下午四時共處理了42宗有人被困升降機報告、175宗自動報火警系統報告、36宗樹木倒塌報告、七宗山泥傾瀉報告，以及69宗水浸事故報告；在其中兩宗水浸事故共協助了六名市民到安全地方。

路政署轄下的市區和新界緊急控制中心在昨晚紅色暴雨警告信號生效後啓動，協調處理緊急道路事故的工作，包括在南區、大埔和西貢等發生山泥傾瀉的路段清理山泥，以盡快開通最少一條行車線予公眾使用，並繼續跟進斜坡緊急復修工作；以及在各區出現水浸的路段，迅速清理受泥水和雜物造成淤塞的路旁集水溝後，即時重開受影響路段。

運輸署緊急事故交通協調中心在黑色暴雨警告信號生效期間繼續24小時運作，並提升級別，密切監察全港各區主要幹道、隧道和橋樑等重要道路的交通及運輸情況。協調中心加快評估暴雨對交通造成的影響，並與相關部門和公共運輸服務營辦商緊密溝通，督導和協調公共運輸服務，應對乘客需求。署方持續檢視各主要幹道及沒有替代路線地點的連接道路清單，務求快捷分辨出須優先清理水浸和路面障礙物的位置，便利相關部門執行清理工作，盡快開通阻塞道路，盡早全面恢復公交服務，將對市民出行的影響減至最低。

在黑色暴雨警告信號生效期間，前線警務人員堅守崗位，在多區協助受暴雨影響的居民，處理因水浸被困的車輛和清理鄉郊淤塞的渠口，疏導交通。

政府呼籲市民，山泥傾瀉警告現時仍然生效，市民應遠離斜坡；駕駛人士亦應避免駛經山區或在斜坡下停泊車輛。居住在靠近斜坡地方的市民，應盡量留在遠離斜坡的房間，並盡量逗留在較高的樓層。如市民收到通知需要疏散，應配合救援人員的指示，即時撤離到安全地方暫避。如市民發現所處地點附近發生山泥傾瀉，應立即離開，並在安全的情況下報警。

此外，民政事務總署至現時合共開放了15個臨時庇護中心，供有需要市民入住。民政事務總署緊急事故協調中心已由凌晨時分開始運作，協調各區工作及傳遞信息，迅速跟進各項緊急事故報告。各區民政事務處亦已啓動相關應對工作，包括協調其他部門和機構作出支援，並動員區議員、地區「三會」委員及關愛隊向區內易受水浸影響的居民發放最新的天氣資訊，提醒他們注意安全。

房屋署聯絡中心於紅色暴雨警告信號發出後迅速啓動，處理突發事故。截至今日下午四時，聯絡中心收到49宗住戶查詢，已即時通知相關組別跟進處理，迅速提供協助。其中葵盛西邨一座大廈短暫停電的個案，經搶修後現時電力供應已恢復。房屋署前線同事亦緊守崗位，作出應對暴雨防範措施，加強巡查，各屋邨設施整體運作未受影響。房屋署會繼續與各部門協作，保障公共屋邨居民的安全。

現時本港天氣仍然不穩定，政府提醒市民留意最新天氣消息及交通情況報告。政府各部門人員會繼續全力進行應對及善後工作，而關愛隊亦會繼續向有需要市民提供支援。"

衞生防護中心呼籲市民在惡劣天氣下提高警覺預防類鼻疽感染,2025-08-05 12:08,2025-08-05 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500500.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（八月五日）呼籲市民在惡劣天氣下提高警覺，保持個人及環境衞生，預防感染類鼻疽，並特別提醒高風險群組，包括長者及長期病患者，在颱風或暴雨後應避免接觸土壤或泥水，減低感染風險。

類鼻疽是一種由類鼻疽伯克氏菌引致的疾病。類鼻疽伯克氏菌廣泛存在於土壤和泥水中，特別是濕潤的黏土。人類可能通過接觸受污染的土壤和水源（尤其是經皮膚損傷／傷口）、吸入受污染的微塵／水滴和飲用受污染的水而受到感染。長期病患者及免疫力弱人士有較大機會受感染。

根據海外文獻和本地數據，在颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令類鼻疽病菌更容易散播，令感染個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。

因應近期本港受颱風以及連日暴雨影響，中心發言人再次提醒市民，特別是高風險群組例如長期病患者，盡量避免接觸土壤或泥水，以免受類鼻疽病菌感染。

類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得人類感染類鼻疽個案。截至昨日（八月四日），本港今年錄得八宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。 因應二○二二年深水埗出現的類鼻疽群組個案，中心及水務署已採取一系列的預防及監察措施，包括在全港所有配水庫的通風口加裝高效能空氣過濾網、加強食水的餘氯含量、持續監測配水庫及用戶水龍頭食水的餘氯含量，並加強健康教育和監測感染個案。至今包括於颱風及暴雨後所進行的監測結果未有出現異常情況，而食水水質監測的結果亦一直符合香港食水標準。

中心發言人解釋，類鼻疽病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可以透過接觸患者的血液或體液而傳播。類鼻疽的病人可出現局部感染（例如皮膚膿腫）、肺炎、腦膜腦炎、敗血症或長期化膿性感染。視乎感染的部位，類鼻疽常見的病徵包括發燒、頭痛、局部痛楚或腫脹、潰瘍、胸痛、咳嗽、咳血及局部淋巴結腫大。中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。

中心再次提醒市民應採取以下措施預防感染：

避免接觸受污染的土壤；
進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿著適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴；
高風險人士如不能避免接觸受污染的水或土壤，應佩戴口罩和手套，並穿上水靴
接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

CHP appeals for heightened vigilance against melioidosis infection following adverse weather conditions,2025-08-05 12:08,2025-08-05 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500502.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 5) appealed to members of the public for heightened vigilance against melioidosis infection following adverse weather conditions and urged them to maintain personal and environmental hygiene. The CHP also specifically reminded high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water after typhoons or storms with a view to lowering infection risk.

  Melioidosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Burkholderia pseudomallei is widespread in soil and muddy water, particularly common in moist clay soil. Humans can become infected through contact with contaminated soil and surface water (especially through skin abrasions/wounds); inhalation of contaminated dust/water droplets; and ingestion of contaminated water. Those with underlying diseases or immunosuppression have higher risks of contracting the disease.

According to overseas literature and local data, Burkholderia pseudomallei in the soil and muddy water may be exposed to the ground after typhoons or storms, and the bacteria would spread more easily with strong wind and storms. As such, infection cases are more common after typhoons or storms.

In view of the recent disturbance caused by typhoon andconsecutive days of torrential rain, the CHP again reminded members of the public, in particular high-risk groups such as those with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water as far as practicable, to prevent melioidosis infection.

Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong and human infection cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year. As of yesterday (August 4), eight melioidosis infection cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded. In light of the cluster of melioidosis cases recorded in Sham Shui Po in 2022, the CHP and the Water Supplies Department have implemented a series of precautionary and monitoring measures, including the installation of high efficiency particulate air filters at the ventilators of all fresh water service reservoirs in Hong Kong, enhancing residual chlorine levels in drinking water, continual monitoring of residual chlorine level of fresh water in service reservoirs and consumers' taps, as well as health education and surveillance of infection cases. No abnormalities were detected from all surveillance results so far, including those conducted after typhoons and heavy rain, while the drinking water quality monitoring results have consistently been in compliance with the Hong Kong Drinking Water Standards.

A spokesman for the CHP explained that person-to-person transmission andanimal-to-human transmission are rare but may occur through contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. Melioidosis may present with localised infection (such as cutaneous abscess), pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, sepsis, or chronic suppurative infection. Depending on the site of infection, common symptoms of melioidosis include fever, headache, localised pain or swelling, ulceration, chest pain, cough, haemoptysis, and swelling of regional lymph nodes. The CHP appealed again to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromised conditions, in order to receive appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment.

The CHP reminded members of the public to take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. usinggloves and wearing boots;
If exposure to contaminated water or soil is inevitable, high-risk individuals should wear a mask, gloves and boots;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover any cuts or grazes with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soilor gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.

Employers and employees should make work arrangements in times of rainstorm warnings,2025-08-05 05:27,2025-08-05 05:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500184.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (August 5) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions as early as possible, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of organisations, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

  ""Employers should make prior work arrangements and contingency measures for staff which are reasonably practicable. In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

  To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or extreme conditions come to an end, when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather or extreme conditions.

  ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.

  If a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.

  If the Government makes an extreme conditions announcement, apart from those required by employers to report for duty at workplaces, employees are advised to stay in the place they are currently in or in safe places when extreme conditions are in force, instead of heading for work. Employees who have already reported for duty at workplaces could continue to work as usual in a safe manner. If the workplaces are in danger, employers should release staff from work early under feasible conditions and in a safe manner or make available a safe place as temporary shelter for employees. If the working time ends while extreme conditions are still in force, employers can release employees from workplaces in a safe manner or provide a suitable area as temporary shelter for those still at workplaces.

  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.

  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.
 
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."
僱主僱員應訂立暴雨警告下的工作安排,2025-08-05 05:26,2025-08-05 05:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500185.htm,"勞工處今日（八月五日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在暴雨警告下及極端情況及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以保障僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主應預先制定合理而可行的工作安排和應變措施。在擬訂及執行有關安排時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮當中的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在暴雨警告或極端情況下及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。」

如果紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外或空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如政府作出極端情況公布，除與僱主就此情況下已訂立返回工作地點上班協定的人員外，僱員應留在原來的地點或安全地點，不要啓程上班。已在工作地點當值的僱員，在安全情況下可如常工作；如工作地點有危險，在可行及安全的情況下，僱主應安排僱員提早下班或到安全的地方暫避。如工作時間在極端情況生效期間結束，僱主應在安全情況下安排僱員下班，或開放合適地方讓仍在工作地點的僱員暫避。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣及極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人亦提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

Employers and employees should make reasonable work arrangements after tropical cyclones or rainstorms,2025-08-05 04:21,2025-08-05 04:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500155.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (August 5) reminded employers to make practical and reasonable work arrangements for employees after the cancellation of tropical cyclone warnings or rainstorm warnings, with due consideration to the road and traffic conditions and other factors, and make flexible arrangements for staff to resume work or work remotely (if applicable). This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.
  
  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (August 5) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

Hong Kong Customs detects two drug trafficking cases invloving passengers at airport (with photo),2025-08-04 22:17,2025-08-04 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400893.htm,"Hong Kong Customs today (August 4) detected two drug trafficking cases involving passengers at Hong Kong International Airport and seized a total of about 20 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with a total estimated market value of about $4 million. Two men were arrested.

The two cases involved two male passengers, aged 49 and 37, who both arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found about 10kg of suspected cannabis buds in each of their check-in suitcases. The two batches of suspected cannabis buds were concealed by vacuum-sealed bags. The two men were subsequently arrested.

The arrested person in the first case has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug and he will appear at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (August 5). The investigation of the second case is ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

âMembers of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
FEHD continues to step up mosquito control and elimination efforts in view of imported chikungunya fever case (with photos),2025-08-04 21:56,2025-08-04 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400906.htm,"  A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (August 4) that, in response to the recent imported case of chikungunya fever (CF), the FEHD works with relevant departments and stakeholders to continuously strengthen mosquito control and elimination work, including removing stagnant water inside construction sites and locations with higher mosquito infestation risks, eliminating adult mosquitoes, conducting publication and education. To effectively implement the mosquito prevention and control work, the FEHD appeals again to the trade to strengthen efforts on mosquito control and elimination.

  Since last month, the FEHD has stepped up mosquito prevention and control measures across all districts to reduce the risk of transmission of CF and other mosquito-borne diseases. Following the recent imported CF case, the FEHD has immediately conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations within 250-metre radius of residence of the patient, including eliminating breeding places and potential breeding grounds, and carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas to eliminate adult mosquitoes. In addition, relevant departments will continue to conduct mosquito prevention and control work in areas under their purview to achieve greater prevention and control effect. In collaboration with relevant departments and local community, the FEHD is also stepping up publicity and educational efforts in the affected district to raise public awareness of mosquito prevention.

  As recent heavy rainstorms have led to stagnant water accumulation at construction sites near the patient's residence, the FEHD has promptly inspected 21 construction sites in the vicinity today and issued 22 statutory notices to the contractors of construction sites with stagnant water, in accordance with Section 27 of the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132), requiring the person-in-charge of relevant construction contractors to effectively eliminate mosquito breeding places. The contractors have taken follow-up actions, and in view of the recent heavy rainfall, removed stagnant water and taken relevant measures, such as placing temephos sand granules to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. The FEHD will continue to monitor the relevant situation.

  The FEHD has been identifying and promptly handling mosquito breeding places through inspections and public complaints. In case of accumulation of water in construction sites or other premises, the FEHD may issue statutory notices to require person-in-charge of the premises to follow up. If there is evidence that the person-in-charge of premises not taking the responsibility resulting in mosquito breeding, the FEHD can take enforcement actions. As of the end of July, the FEHD has initiated 84 prosecutions this year, including 77 cases related to construction sites and 7 cases involving other premises.

  When meeting with trade representatives in the end of July this year, the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) and the FEHD appealed to workers at outdoor construction sites to raise awareness and take personal protective measures to avoid mosquito bites. The EEB and the FEHD expect the relevant trade to continue adopting measures to reduce the risk of disease transmission.

  Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD again appeals to members of the public to continue joining hands in strengthening personal mosquito control measures:

Tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
Remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
Change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants no more than every 7 days;
Properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquito from accessing the water;
Properly dispose articles that are able to contain water such as empty lunch boxes, cans and tyres; and
Pave or fill uneven ground and/or holes.


  Members of the public may refer to the FEHD's webpage on mosquito prevention and control (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/risk-pest-mosquito.html#), and should constantly pay attention to the information regarding CF released by the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health. The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems."

基孔肯雅熱由基孔肯雅熱病毒引起，主要透過伊蚊傳播，根據世界衞生組織（世衞）的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱個案。截至今年六月初，全球14個國家／地區共錄得超過22萬宗個案，當中約80宗為死亡個案。基孔肯雅熱在亞洲部分地區流行，與登革熱及寨卡病毒並存。自今年六月底起，廣東省佛山市已錄得超過7 000宗個案，絕大部分個案在順德區錄得。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

本港今年累計錄得一宗基孔肯雅熱個案，屬輸入個案，未有錄得本地個案。由於在夏季期間氣溫及雨量上升，本港蚊患情況可能會加劇，加上市民在暑假會較頻繁前往蚊傳疾病流行的地區，因此再出現輸入個案的風險相當高，並有引致本地傳播的潛在風險。

建議措施

科學委員會認同政府持續採取以下相應防控措施：


加強監測：密切監測全球及鄰近地區的基孔肯雅熱情況，包括透過粵港澳三地傳染病通報機制，以了解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況。持續向醫生和醫院發布最新流行病學資訊，提醒醫護人員應保持警覺。
實驗室檢測：提升本地檢測能力，確保懷疑個案可盡快獲得診斷。
蚊媒監測及滅蚊：部門與各個相關界別合作，在夏季加強蚊媒監測和控制蚊患，並應重點關注高風險地點作跟進；探討控制蚊患方法的最新發展。
個案調查及防控措施：當出現確診個案，迅速展開流行病學調查及病媒調查，並安排病人到醫院，在無蚊環境下接受治療。
口岸防控措施及外遊建議：維持於各個口岸進行巡查，確保有效落實防蚊措施及保持良好環境衞生；與業界持份者保持緊密聯繫並為其提供健康建議；加強對外遊及回港人士的健康教育。
風險溝通和宣傳：透過不同渠道發放有關基孔肯雅熱的資訊和預防措施，並向學校和院舍提供防蚊滅蚊指引。
疫苗成效監察：目前關於現有基孔肯雅熱疫苗的效力和安全性的科學證據尚未足夠。政府應繼續監察世衞和海外衞生當局的最新建議。


​科學委員會確認政府採取的多項應急措施至今有效阻止基孔肯雅熱於本地傳播，並認為面對輸入個案風險，持續實施相關措施十分重要。

Scientific Committee on Vector-borne Diseases releases consensus statement on prevention and control of chikungunya fever,2025-08-04 21:06,2025-08-04 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400857.htm,"In response to the recent spike in chikungunya fever (CF) cases in multiple regions worldwide, the Scientific Committee on Vector-borne Diseases (SCVBD) under the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health convened a meeting today (August 4) to review the recent epidemiological data and corresponding prevention and control strategies for CF in Hong Kong. The SCVBD noted that the Government has already implemented a series of preventive measures against CF.

The consensus statement by the SCVBD provided a risk assessment for Hong Kong and recommended ongoing measures for the Government to mitigate the risk of CF imported cases and potential local transmission.

Risk assessment

CF is caused by the chikungunya virus and is mainly transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. As of early June this year, over 220 000 cases had been reported in 14 countries/regions worldwide. Of these cases, about 80 were fatal. CF is endemic in parts of Asia, with concurrent circulation alongside dengue and Zika viruses. Since the end of June this year, there were over 7 000 cases recorded in Foshan City, Guangdong Province, with majority of cases occurring in Shunde District. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases.

A total of one CF case has been recorded in Hong Kong this year, which is an imported case. No local cases have been recorded. Due to the increase in temperature and rainfall in summer, mosquito infestation might be aggravated in Hong Kong. In addition, members of the public travel more frequently during summer holidays to regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. As a result, Hong Kong has a high risk of occurrence of importation of CF cases again, leading to the potential risk of local transmission.

Recommended measures

The SCVBD endorsed the following ongoing and corresponding preventive and control measures implemented by the Government:


Enhanced Surveillance: maintain close monitoring of global and neighbouring regions' CF situations, including keeping abreast of the latest situation of CF through the communicable disease notification mechanism between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao. Continue to update doctors and hospitals on the latest epidemiological information and remind healthcare professionals to remain vigilant.
Laboratory testing: enhance local testing capabilities to ensure rapid diagnosis of suspected cases.
Vector surveillance and control: departments to collaborate with relevant sectors to strengthen vector surveillance and mosquito control during the summer. Pay attention to high risk spots and follow-up. The Government should also explore the latest development of mosquito control methods.
Case investigation and control measures: conduct prompt epidemiological investigations and vector surveys upon case detection; arrange patients to be admitted to hospital to receive treatment in mosquito-free environments.
Port health measures and travel advice: maintain inspections at boundary control points for vector control and environmental hygiene; maintain close liaison with industry stakeholders and provide health advice to them; strengthen health education for outgoing and returning travellers to affected areas.
Risk communication and publicity: disseminate information on CF and preventive measures through different channels, and provide schools and institutions with guidance on anti-mosquito measures.
Vaccine effectiveness monitoring: there is so far insufficient scientific evidence on efficacy and safety of existing CF vaccines. The Government should monitor the latest recommendations from the WHO and overseas health authorities.


The SCVBD affirmed that Hong Kong's multi-pronged approach on emergency preparedness has effectively prevented local CF transmission to date. Sustained implementation of these measures is crucial to address the importation risk.

The consensus statement of the SCVBD has been uploaded to the CHP website."

尊敬的李大宏董事長（香港大公文匯傳媒集團董事長兼大公報社社長、香港文匯報社社長）、林枬副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室宣傳文體部副部長）、白濤董事長（粤海控股集團有限公司董事長）、黃黑蠻先生（香港警察書畫學會副會長）、姚志勝先生（中國和平統一促進會香港總會會長）、王惠貞女士（王新興有限公司董事總經理）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家下午好！

今天我很榮幸跟大家聚首一堂，一同參加首屆香港「黃永玉」國際青年版畫藝術家扶持計劃的年度展覽開幕典禮。扶持計劃旨在推動中國版畫藝術的國際化發展，挖掘和培養國際青年版畫藝術人才，促進東西方文化藝術交流，為香港建設中外文化藝術交流中心注入強勁動力。為支持扶持計劃，文化體育及旅遊局不單應邀成為扶持計劃的聯合主辦單位，剛才大家也看到了，我亦於今年較早時已經拍攝視頻協助宣傳。

扶持計劃以黃永玉先生命名，黃老是我們祖國當代國寶級藝術家之一，代表作不勝枚舉，享譽海內外。當中，大家剛才從視頻中也看到，作品《春潮》和《阿詩瑪》，它們都是中國版畫經典之作，奠定了黃老在中國版畫界的崇高地位。扶持計劃旨在傳承黃老終身創新、勇於探索的藝術精神，致力挖掘中國各地的青年藝術家並為他們提供展示平台、媒體推廣與學術交流機會。今天我們可以欣賞到約一百名青年藝術家的創作，他們的作品均是經過專家嚴格挑選，在中外近千名青年藝術家中脫穎而出，表現出眾。展覽更特別展出黃老以及其他藝術大師的作品，透過新銳與經典的深度對話，展現中國當代版畫藝術的多元風貌與時代價值。

香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心，擁有獨特的優勢，不僅融匯中外文化，更能將傳統與創新緊密相連。青年藝術家作為文化藝術產業持續發展的生力軍，我期待年輕一代能夠擁抱香港的多樣性和包容性，發揮潛能，進一步激發創意和活力，為中華文化注入更多生機，延續其強大的軟實力。黃老在他一生的藝術實踐中，展現出濃厚的家國情懷與人文精神，年青藝術家亦應當以黃老為學習榜樣，積極拓寬國際視野，在培養世界觀的同時亦應心繫家國，銳意在國際舞台弘揚優秀的中華傳統文化。

藝術承載歷史，也指引未來，我衷心希望年輕一代的藝術家們能全身全心投入藝術創作。同時，也希望你們能勇於把握每一次展現自我的機會，讓更多人欣賞到你們卓越的藝術作品。我期待你們以獨特的藝術言語，譜寫未來的無限可能，向世界說好中國故事、說好文化故事。

最後，我祝願扶持計劃圓滿成功，各位事事順利、身體健康！謝謝大家！"
食環署因應基孔肯雅熱輸入個案持續加強控蚊滅蚊工作（附圖）,2025-08-04 19:10,2025-08-04 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400789.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）發言人今日（八月四日）表示，就日前出現的基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，食環署聯同各相關部門及持份者繼續加強控蚊滅蚊工作，包括清除地盤及蚊患風險較高地點的積水、殺滅成蚊及進行宣傳教育等。為令防治蚊患工作落到實處，食環署再次呼籲業界繼續加強控蚊滅蚊工作。

食環署自上月起已在全港各區加強防控蚊患措施，以降低基孔肯雅熱等蚊傳疾病的傳播風險。因應日前出現的基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，食環署已即時在個案患者住所250米範圍內進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，包括消除蚊子滋生地及潛在蚊子滋生地，以及於樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊等。另外，各相關部門亦會在轄下的場地及處所持續進行蚊患預防及控制工作，以加強防控效果。食環署亦聯同相關部門及地區人士在當區加強宣傳教育，提高市民防蚊意識。

由於個案患者住所附近的地盤因連日下雨而有積水情況，食環署今日已即時巡查附近一帶共21個建築地盤，並按香港法例第132章《公眾衞生及市政條例》第27條向有積水的地盤承辦商一共發出22張法定通知書，要求有關地盤承辦商負責人必須做好清除蚊子滋生地的工作。承辦商已採取行動跟進，並因應這幾天的降雨量高，清除積水及採取相應措施，例如在積水的地方施放蚊沙等以防止蚊子滋生。食環署會持續監察有關情況。

食環署一直通過巡查及市民投訴等，找出並盡快處理蚊子滋生地。如在地盤或其他處所發現有積水情況，食環署可發出法定通知要求處所負責人跟進；如有證據顯示處所負責人失責導致有蚊子滋生，食環署更可採取檢控行動。直至七月底，食環署今年已提出84宗檢控，包括77宗涉及建築地盤的個案，7宗則涉及其他處所。

今年七月底，環境及生態局及食環署與業界代表會面時，已呼籲在戶外地盤工作的員工提高防蚊意識，採取個人保護措施以避免被蚊叮咬。環境及生態局及食環署期望相關業界持續採取措施，降低疾病傳播風險。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與亦至關重要。食環署繼續呼籲市民攜手合作加強個人防蚊措施，包括：


收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒、空罐和輪胎；及
鋪平或填補不平坦的地面及孔洞。


市民可參考食環署有關防控蚊患的網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/risk-pest-mosquito.html#），亦應持續留意衞生署衞生防護中心發出有關基孔肯雅熱的資訊。如有發現蚊患情況，請致電1823。"

"SITI attends APEC Digital and AI Ministerial Meeting in Incheon, Korea (with photos)",2025-08-04 18:36,2025-08-04 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400701.htm,"  The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Digital and AI Ministerial Meeting (DMM) in Incheon, Korea, today (August 4). Under this year's theme ""Digital and AI Transformation toward Prosperity and Sustainable Growth for All"", Professor Sun called for international collaboration to advocate for the safe and responsible adoption of digital and AI technologies, and foster innovation across the region.

  In his speech at the thematic session ""Facilitating Digital and AI Innovation to Address Challenges"", Professor Sun said that AI stands out as the defining force of the time. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has placed AI at the forefront of its strategic agenda and has made meticulous preparations to build the infrastructure and ecosystems needed to thrive in this AI-driven era, including the establishment of the AI Supercomputing Centre by Cyberport, two research clusters under the InnoHK platform, with one of which focusing on AI and robotics technologies and housing the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center, as well as the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute.

  Professor Sun also highlighted that Hong Kong is committed to enhancing public service excellence and promoting economic upgrading and transformation through digital strategies. Advanced digital infrastructures, such as ""iAM Smart"" and the ""Digital Corporate Identity"" platform, will accelerate the development of the digital economy in Hong Kong, delivering greater benefits to people and businesses.

  Speaking at another thematic session, ""Creating a Safe and Trustworthy Digital and AI Ecosystem"", Professor Sun pointed out that the powerful capability of AI is a double-edged sword, and that a strategic, vigilant and responsible deployment of AI is imperative for all governments and organisations. Hong Kong has been closely working with professional international cybersecurity organisations to respond quickly and proactively to the latest cyber threats and attacks.

  He added that good governance is the cornerstone of a safe, responsible and trustworthy AI ecosystem.

CHP announces no new confirmed chikungunya fever infection cases today (with photos),2025-08-04 18:25,2025-08-04 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400695.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 4) said that no new confirmed chikungunya fever (CF) infection cases had been recorded as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the recent CF case. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

A total of one CF case has been recorded in Hong Kong this year, which is an imported case. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

The CHP's Port Health Division has stepped up publicity and education efforts regarding CF at boundary control points, conducting more frequent inspections to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Staff members today conducted inspection at MTR Lok Ma Chau Station and its vicinity with staff members of the MTR Corporation Limited and recommended anti-mosquito measures. In addition, staff members also conduct temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fever or related symptoms will be assessed for their health condition and referred to hospitals for follow-up when necessary. The CHP also maintains close liaison with relevant stakeholders, such as airlines and the travel industry, to provide the latest disease information and health advice in a timely manner.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public that if they return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. Members of the public should closely observe their personal health condition, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrange appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has intensified anti-mosquito measures at the residence of the confirmed patient and the locations visited after the onset of illness. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces as well as removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The latest gravidtrap indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas are available on the department website at:www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Ovitrap_Index_Update.html#.

The CHP will collaborate with the FEHD to hold an online live seminar on itsFacebook pagetomorrow (August 5) from 8pm to 8.30pm, to provide information and health advice on preventing mosquito bites and controlling mosquito breeding, as well as addressing related public enquiries. Members of the public are welcome to attend.
