Health Bureau welcomes Ombudsman's direct investigation operation report,2026-02-05 18:28,2026-02-05 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500629.htm,"The Health Bureau (HHB) welcomed the recommendations made to the Government and the Department of Health (DH) in the Office of The Ombudsman (Ombudsman)'s direct investigation operation report entitled ""Effectiveness of Administrative Support Provided for Complaint Handling by Secretariat of Medical Council of Hong Kong under Department of Health, and Department of Health's Regulatory Role"" (Report) released today (February 5). The HHB expressed gratitude to the Ombudsman for putting forward a series of pertinent and useful observations and views on strengthening the Medical Council of Hong Kong (MCHK) as the statutory regulatory body for the medical profession. With reference to the Ombudsman's views and the Report, the HHB will formulate detailed proposals to amend the Medical Registration Ordinance (MRO), with a view to enabling the MCHK and its Secretariat to discharge their duties of upholding doctors' professional conduct and continuously enhancing medical professional standards more effectively under the principle of professional autonomy.

Since the Ombudsman announced the launch of a full investigation on November 5 last year, the HHB and the DH have been fully co-operating with the Ombudsman's investigation. Although the MCHK as a statutory professional regulatory body fell outside the scope of the Ombudsman's investigation, the HHB and the DH have, in respect of matters covered by the investigation, liaised and communicated with the MCHK, and provided relevant information to the Ombudsman to facilitate the investigation and formulation of improvement measures. Many of the measures recommended in the Report on the support provided by the DH and the Secretariat of the MCHK for the complaint handling mechanism of the MCHK, as well as the Ombudsman's series of observations and views on the current regulatory framework for the medical profession, align with the HHB's overarching directions in reviewing the MRO, namely to ensure that the legislation for healthcare professions keeps pace with the times, meets societal needs and the public interest, and to enable the MCHK to discharge its various statutory functions more effectively, including its function in handling complaints.

Meanwhile, in response to the request made by the Secretary for Health in October last year, the MCHK has completed its review on improving the complaint handling mechanism and submitted a report and supplementary information to the HHB. In January this year, the HHB commenced a series of consultations on amending the MRO, meeting with patient groups, the two local medical schools, the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, the Hong Kong Medical Association and other medical professional bodies. The HHB also visited the MCHK yesterday(February 4) to exchange views with members on the amendment to the MRO. The HHB will further take into account the Ombudsman's Report and the views of various stakeholders, and will formulate proposals to amend the MRO having regard to the operational needs of the MCHK. The HHB will also propose measures to strengthen the functions of the Secretariat of the MCHK under the DH. The HHB will brief the Panel on Health Services of the Legislative Council (LegCo) shortly on the proposed directions and enhancement proposals for the MRO, with a target of introducing an amendment bill into the LegCo in the first half of this year."
入境處聯同內地執法機關搗破跨境偽證集團（附圖）,2026-02-05 18:14,2026-02-05 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500509.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）聯同廣東省公安廳出入境管理總隊及珠海市公安出入境管理部門，展開跨境聯合行動，成功搗破一個跨境偽證集團，共拘捕119人並檢獲大量偽證製造設備及偽造證件。

內地執法機關於去年八月發現涉及組織內地居民來港從事非法工作的重要線索。入境處迅速與內地執法機關展開深入調查，成功鎖定一個專門招攬內地居民來港從事非法工作的跨境偽證集團。該集團於內地設置製作偽證據點，並將僞造香港身份證寄送至內地不同城巿，然後由集團成員將偽證運送至香港。之後，再由集團在港主腦將這些偽證分發予非法勞工，並安排宿舍及協助他們尋找工作。

入境處調查人員於二○二五年十月至二○二六年一月展開代號「銳鋒」的執法行動，突擊搜查38個目標地點，包括16個住宅單位以及22個工作地點。在行動中成功拘捕102人，年齡介乎32至74歲，當中包括兩名為主腦及骨幹人員的集團成員、83名懷疑非法勞工及涉案人士，以及17名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。該兩名集團成員分別為一名39歲內地居民及一名57歲香港居民。而83名被捕的懷疑非法勞工及涉案人士為23男60女，包括一名香港居民以及82名內地居民，年齡介乎32至70歲。此外，入境處調查人員在行動中檢獲40張偽造香港身份證及24張偽造香港身份證副本。入境處相信透過是次大規模聯合行動，已成功瓦解該跨境偽證集團。目前相關調查仍在進行中，入境處不排除將有更多涉案人士被拘捕。

內地方面，執法機關成功搗破兩個製作偽證據點，共拘捕17名集團骨幹成員，並檢獲三台偽證製造設備。

入境處發言人說：「根據現行香港法例，任何人士如使用或管有偽造香港身份證乃屬違法，一經定罪，最高罰款為十萬元及監禁十年。任何人無合法權限或合理辯解而將身份證轉讓給他人即屬犯罪，一經定罪，最高罰款為十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人警告：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。而根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口及／或強迫勞動指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口及／或強迫勞動的元素。被識別的販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

Cross-boundary forgery syndicate smashed by Immigration Department and Mainland authorities (with photos),2026-02-05 18:14,2026-02-05 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500511.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a cross-boundary joint operation with the Exit and Entry Administration Corps of the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department and the Immigration Authority of Zhuhai Municipal Public Security Bureau and successfully neutralised a cross-boundary forgery syndicate, resulting in the arrest of a total of 119 persons and the seizure of a large amount of forgery equipment and forged documents.

  In August last year, the Mainland authorities unearthed crucial intelligence related to a syndicate arranging Mainlanders to take up illegal employment in Hong Kong. The ImmD immediately collaborated with the Mainland authorities to conduct an in-depth investigation and successfully identified a cross-boundary forgery syndicate specialising in recruiting Mainlanders to take up illegal employment in Hong Kong. The syndicate had set up forgery workshops on the Mainland for producing forged documents and shipped the forged Hong Kong identity cards to different cities of the Mainland. Syndicate members would transport the forged Hong Kong identity cards into Hong Kong. The syndicate mastermind in Hong Kong would then distribute the forged Hong Kong identity cards to the illegal workers, provide them with accommodation and assist them in seeking employment.

  ImmD investigators launched an operation code-named ""Sharpspear"" from October 2025 to January 2026. They raided a total of 38 premises, including 16 residential premises and 22 working places, and arrested a total of 102 persons, including two syndicate members comprising a mastermind and a core member, 83 suspected illegal workers and persons involved in the case and 17 suspected employers, aged 32 to 74. The two syndicate members are one Mainland resident aged 39 and one Hong Kong resident aged 57. The 83 arrested suspected illegal workers and persons involved in the case comprise 23 men and 60 women, consisting of one Hong Kong resident and 82 Mainlanders, aged 32 to 70. ImmD investigators also seized 40 forged Hong Kong identity cards and 24 copies of forged Hong Kong identity cards. Through this large-scale joint operation, the cross-boundary forgery syndicate has been neutralised. The investigation is still ongoing, and more persons involved in the case may be arrested.

  On the Mainland side, two forgery workshops were smashed and a total of 17 syndicate core members were arrested, and three pieces of forgery equipment were seized.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Under the laws of Hong Kong, anyone who uses or possesses a forged identity card commits an offence. Offenders are liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, a maximum penalty of a fine of $100,000 and 10 years' imprisonment. Any person who without lawful authority or reasonable excuse transfers to another person a Hong Kong identity card commits an offence. Offenders are liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, a maximum penalty of a fine of $100,000 and 10 years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman warned, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties. As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) and/or forced labour victims. When any TIP and/or forced labour indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP and/or forced labour elements. Identified TIP and/or forced labour victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP and/or forced labour victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit the ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."

自公署於去年十一月五日宣布進行全面調查以來，醫衞局及衞生署一直全面配合公署調查，雖然醫委會作為法定專業規管機構在公署調查範圍之外，但局方和署方均就調查所涉及的事宜與醫委會進行了解和溝通，並向公署提供相關資料以助調查及提出改善措施。主動調查行動報告就衞生署及醫委會秘書處支援醫委會處理投訴機制作出不少建議措施，以及公署就現行醫療專業規管制度提出的一系列觀察及意見，均與醫衞局檢討《條例》確保醫護專業法例與時並進，符合社會需要和公眾利益，以優化醫委會令其能更有效履行各項法定職能，包括處理申訴職能的大方向吻合。

與此同時，因應醫衞局局長去年十月提出的要求，醫委會已就完善投訴處理機制完成檢討並向醫衞局提交報告及𥙷充資料。醫衞局於今年一月就修訂《條例》開展一系列的諮詢，會見病人組織、兩所本地醫學院、香港醫學專科學院、香港醫學會及其他醫學界的專業團體，昨日（二月四日）亦到訪醫委會就修訂《條例》與委員進行交流。醫衞局將進一步參考公署報告及各持份者的建議，並按醫委會的運作需要制訂修訂《條例》建議，亦會提出措施強化衞生署醫委會秘書處職能。醫衞局稍後會向立法會衞生事務委員會介紹建議方向和完善《條例》方案，目標在今年上半年向立法會提交《條例》修訂草案。"

至於公署提出的其他涉及醫委會及其秘書處行政安排的建議，衞生署會邀請醫委會參考公署的建議，以檢視及完善現有安排。就秘書處的整體行政支援績效、人手及資源需求、以及人事表現管理等方面，衞生署日後會進一步加強與醫委會溝通，以提升秘書處的工作效率。

衞生署強調，香港醫生專業奉行專業自主的原則。政府將透過修訂法例，以及其他行政和資源上的支援，協助醫委會履行其法定職責，進一步提升醫生的專業水平和道德操守，以維護公眾及病人的利益。"
DH responds to Ombudsman's direct investigation operation report,2026-02-05 17:35,2026-02-05 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500599.htm,"​Regarding the report on the direct investigation operation released by the Office of The Ombudsman today (February 5) on the ""effectiveness of administrative support provided for complaint handling by Secretariat of Medical Council of Hong Kong (MCHK) under Department of Health (DH), and DH's regulatory role"", the DH responds as follows:

The Government appreciates the Ombudsman's attention to the work of the MCHK and its valuable suggestions. The Government accepts and will actively follow up on the recommendations in the report, striving to assist the MCHK in optimising its complaint-handling mechanism, enhancing operational efficiency, and improving service quality.

The MCHK is a statutory body established under the Medical Registration Ordinance (MRO) (Cap. 161) to handle matters relating to the professional development of medical practitioners, maintain healthcare standards and protect patients in accordance with the powers conferred by legislation. The DH has consistently provided the MCHK with Secretariat staff or other resources to support the MCHK in fulfilling its duties under the MRO and relevant subsidiary legislation.

In its report, the Ombudsman expressed concerns about the MCHK's current mechanism and the progress in complaint handling, and put forward a number of recommendations for improvement, some of which will involve legislative amendments. In this regard, the Health Bureau had previously indicated that it would propose amendments to the MRO in response to the report submitted by the MCHK and its operational needs in order to ensure that the mechanism keeps pace with the times and meets the needs of society.

Regarding other recommendations made by the Ombudsman concerning the administrative arrangements of the MCHK and its Secretariat, the DH will invite the MCHK to review and refine the existing arrangements based on the Ombudsman's recommendations. Furthermore, the DH will strengthen communication with the MCHK regarding the Secretariat's overall performance of administrative support, staffing and resource requirements, as well as performance management of Secretariat staff to enhance the Secretariat's operational efficiency.

The DH stressed that the medical professioninHong Konghave all along upheld the principle of professional autonomy. The Government will assist the MCHK in discharging its statutory duties through legislative amendments, and other administrative and resource support, thereby further enhancing the professional standards and conduct of doctors to safeguard the interests of public and patients."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-02-05 17:30,2026-02-05 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500557.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（二月五日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-05 17:30,2026-02-05 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500558.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 5), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

At the meeting, members were briefed by a university research team on the review results of Targeted Poverty Alleviation Schemes. Members were pleased to note that the Strive and Rise Programme, the Pilot Programme on Community Living Room, and the School-based After School Care Service Scheme have achieved their key performance indicators, with certain indicators exceeding expectations. This reflects the schemes' positive impact on service beneficiaries' living standards and personal development, and further affirms the direction of the strategy of targeted poverty alleviation and its effectiveness. The review findings will be incorporated into the proposed Report on Impact of Targeted Poverty Alleviation Strategy in Hong Kong.

Members also noted that the Report will quantify at a macro level the social value transferred to households that benefit from regular housing, health, education, and welfare measures. Such an analysis would reflect in a more comprehensive manner the Government's efforts and effectiveness in alleviating poverty.

The Government will prepare the Report according to the timetable and consult the CoP with a view to releasing it in mid-2026."
一月份白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數繼續處於低水平,2026-02-05 17:00,2026-02-05 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500513.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（二月五日）公布，一月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之零點一，較二○二五年十二月份的百分之零點二為低，繼續處於最低的一級水平，顯示監察地區內白紋伊蚊的分布情況並不廣泛。

一月份，全部62個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數均低於百分之二十的警戒水平，大部分地區更為百分之零。另外，一月份白紋伊蚊密度指數為一，表示在發現白紋伊蚊的誘蚊器中，白紋伊蚊的平均數量為一隻，顯示整體監察地區內的白紋伊蚊成蚊數量並不多。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁www.fehd.gov.hk。

食環署發言人表示：「食環署與相關政府部門已持續深化在各自管轄範圍的防蚊滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊子滋生地、施放殺幼蟲劑、以霧化處理方式殺滅成蚊，並於適當位置設置捕蚊器等。食環署亦為政府部門提供專業意見和技術支援，協助他們迅速制訂和實施有效的滅蚊措施，同時加強公眾宣傳教育。在各方共同努力和合作下，一月份的指數維持低水平。雖然如此，但蚊子在冬季仍會繁殖和活動，食環署會持續監察各區的蚊患情況，並採取迅速有效的防治措施。」

食環署今年繼續分三期進行全港滅蚊運動，第一期滅蚊運動將於二月二十三日展開，至三月二十日止。其間，食環署各分區辦事處將會針對區內民居、學校、建築地盤、公共屋邨、醫院、非法耕種場地、海旁各公共和私人貨物裝卸區、邊境檢查站、避風塘及出入境碼頭等的周邊範圍，進行清除積水及防治蚊患行動。另外，去年五月七日起展開的全城防蚊及滅蚊行動現時仍在進行中，食環署會繼續聯同相關部門清除潛在蚊子滋生地，以及定期以超低微量噴灑方式殺滅成蚊。食環署呼籲私人物業管理公司繼續積極參與全城防蚊及滅蚊行動。

現時，食環署會定期在部門網頁公布白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數。為讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，食環署已加強資訊發放，並通過新聞公報及社交媒體盡快發放最新的誘蚊器指數。

此外，為進一步降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險，食環署將原先在分區指數達20%時啓動的強化控蚊工作，擴展至指數介乎10%至20%的區域。具體而言，食環署會在有關區域進行詳細風險評估，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，聯同各部門及持份者進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作，亦會通知附近的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

為降低基孔肯雅熱及登革熱等蚊傳疾病的傳播風險，食環署繼續在全港各區加強防控蚊患措施，並在病者的住所及於感染期曾到訪的地點250米範圍內進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊蟲滋生地、於不能清除的積水處施放殺幼蟲劑，以及於成蚊棲息處如樹木茂密、陰暗隱蔽的地點和荒廢結構進行超低微量霧化處理，以殺滅成蚊。

食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境以徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

白紋伊蚊是傳播登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的病媒。登革熱常見於熱帶及亞熱帶地區，在多個東南亞國家，已成為風土病。世界衞生組織（世衞）於二○二四年共錄得超過1 400萬宗登革熱個案，創歷史新高。此外，根據世衞的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。去年全球多國爆發基孔肯雅熱，截至去年十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區共錄得逾50萬宗個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。"
Monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in January remains at low level,2026-02-05 17:00,2026-02-05 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500514.htm,"  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (February 5) announced that the monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in January was 0.1 per cent, lower than the 0.2 per cent recorded in December 2025, which remained at the lowest Level 1, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in the areas surveyed was not extensive.

  In January, all 62 survey areas recorded an area gravidtrap index (AGI) lower than the alert level of 20 per cent, and most of the areas recorded 0 per cent. Moreover, the monthly density index for Aedes albopictus in January was 1, which represented that an average of one Aedes albopictus adult was found in the Aedes-positive gravidtraps, indicating that the number of adult Aedes albopictus was not abundant in the survey areas. The gravidtrap and density indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department website at www.fehd.gov.hk.

  A spokesman for the FEHD said, ""The FEHD has continued to intensify mosquito prevention and control work with relevant government departments in areas under their purview, including eliminating mosquito breeding places, applying larvicides, conducting fogging operations to eradicate adult mosquitoes, and placing mosquito trapping devices at suitable locations. The FEHD has also provided government departments with professional advice and technical support to assist them in swiftly formulating and implementing effective anti-mosquito measures while strengthening publicity and education at the same time. Under the concerted efforts and collaboration of various parties, the index in January remained at a low level. Nevertheless, the breeding and activity of mosquitoes will not stop in winter. The FEHD will continue to monitor the mosquito infestation in all districts and will conduct prompt and effective mosquito prevention and control work.""

  The FEHD will continue to conduct a three-phase Anti-mosquito Campaign this year. The first phase of the territory-wide campaign will be launched on February 23 and will run until March 20. During the period, the district offices of the FEHD will target residences, schools, construction sites, public housing estates, hospitals, illegal cultivation sites, waterfront public and private cargo working areas, cross-boundary checkpoints, typhoon shelters and cross-boundary ferry terminals, to remove accumulated water and carry out mosquito prevention and control work. Furthermore, the All-out Anti-mosquito Operations, which began on May 7 last year, are still ongoing. The FEHD will continue to collaborate with relevant departments to eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites and eradicate adult mosquitoes by means of regular ultra-low volume fogging operations. The FEHD appeals to property management agents to continue actively participating in the All-out Anti-mosquito Operations.

  The FEHD currently makes regular announcements on gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus on its webpage. To allow more citizens to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation, the FEHD has strengthened information dissemination by promptly announcing the latest gravidtrap indexes through press releases and social media.

  In addition, to further reduce the risk of transmission of chikungunya fever (CF), the FEHD has extended its intensified mosquito control work, which was originally activated when the AGI reaches 20 per cent, to cover areas with the AGI falling between 10 and 20 per cent. Specifically, the FEHD will conduct detailed risk assessments in the areas concerned to identify locations with higher mosquito infestation risks and, in collaboration with relevant departments and stakeholders, conduct intensive and targeted mosquito control work. The FEHD will also notify nearby housing estates, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and work together to take mosquito prevention and elimination measures.

  To reduce the risk of transmission of CF and dengue fever (DF), the FEHD continues to step up mosquito prevention and control measures across all districts and conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations within a 250-metre radius of the residence of patients and the places patients had visited during the infectious period, including removing mosquito breeding grounds, applying larvicides to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and carrying out ultra-low volume fogging operations in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

  The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  Aedes albopictus is a kind of mosquito that can transmit DF and CF. DF is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and has become endemic in many countries in Southeast Asia. In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded over 14 million DF cases, which was a record number. Furthermore, according to the WHO, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks last year; as of December 10, 2025, more than 500 000 cases had been reported in over 40 countries/regions worldwide. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries."

香港金融管理局（金管局）及香港銀行公會（銀行公會）今日（二月五日）聯同香港律師會（律師會）及地產代理監管局公布，「置易付」（註一）物業交易支付安排將由二○二六年二月二十八日起（註二），擴展至香港的二手住宅物業買賣。這項安排亦得到消費者委員會（消委會）的支持。

在「置易付」安排下，買方的按揭貸款款項會透過銀行之間的電子支付系統轉帳至賣方銀行，賣方最快可於成交當日收到出售物業的收益。相較於傳統支付方式，款項須經雙方律師的銀行戶口以支票進行交收（註三），「置易付」是更快更安全的選擇。如有意採用「置易付」，買賣雙方可通知其地產代理在臨時買賣合約加入相關條款。

金管局總裁余偉文表示：「金管局一直致力推動物業交易電子支付，以提升效率和安全性。隨着『置易付』在轉按市場被廣泛應用，其適用範圍將擴展至二手住宅物業買賣。我們鼓勵市民積極使用新安排，並衷心感謝律師會、地產代理監管局、消委會，以及其他持份者就『置易付』給予的寶貴意見和協助，進一步完善措施，為買賣雙方提供更安全、更快捷的支付選項。」

銀行公會主席、中國銀行（香港）有限公司副董事長兼總裁孫煜表示：「銀行公會自二○二三年起開展研究工作，將『置易付』的適用範圍擴展至二手住宅物業買賣交易。經過深入研究、廣泛諮詢並綜合業界及相關持份者的意見後，形成今天出台的方案。銀行業界在『置易付』的操作系統、流程及內部指引等方面已全面就緒，目前正為各前線單位提供培訓，確保各項配置同步到位。『置易付』將會為物業交易買賣雙方帶來穩妥的電子支付方案，推動按揭貸款業務流程數碼化。」

律師會會長湯文龍表示：「『置易付』並非一項全新概念，現時在轉按交易都可以選用，運作順利。隨着電子支付在香港愈趨普及，香港律師會認為，這項安排擴展至二手住宅物業買賣，是順應時代發展及科技進步的自然趨勢，香港律師會表示支持。不同支付方式適合不同交易，每宗物業交易的情況均有所不同，律師在交易中為客戶把關，提供法律意見，協助妥善管理風險。」

地產代理監管局行政總裁梁松泰表示：「地產代理監管局十分支持銀行業界將物業交易支付安排『置易付』擴展至香港二手住宅物業買賣。在過去一年多，我們積極與金管局及銀行公會就『置易付』的細節進行溝通，並充當他們與地產代理業界之間的溝通橋樑。地產代理監管局期望地產代理在處理二手住宅物業買賣時，積極向客戶介紹『置易付』，好讓客戶知道『置易付』可為他們帶來的好處，並作出合適的支付方法選擇。」

銀行公會已發布小冊子，介紹「置易付」二手住宅物業買賣交易下的支付安排。市民亦可向按揭銀行、地產代理和律師查詢有關詳情。

註一：「置易付」在二○二二年十一月推出，率先涵蓋住宅物業轉按交易，至今合共超過1.5萬宗交易透過「置易付」進行。過去六個月，超過75%的合資格轉按交易採用「置易付」。
註二：按揭銀行會為二○二六年二月二十八日或以後簽署臨時買賣合約的香港二手住宅物業買賣提供「置易付」。
註三：一般需待成交後兩個工作天及支票收妥後方可完成收款。"
Expansion of PAPT to cover sale and purchase of residential properties in secondary market,2026-02-05 16:30,2026-02-05 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500316.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB), together with the Law Society of Hong Kong (LSHK) and the Estate Agents Authority (EAA), jointly announced today (February 5) the expansion of the Payment Arrangements for Property Transactions (PAPT) (Note 1)to cover the sale and purchase (S&P) of residential properties in the secondary market of Hong Kong, effective from February 28, 2026 (Note 2). This initiative is also supported by the Consumer Council (CC).

Under PAPT, the buyer's mortgage loan proceeds will be transferred to the seller's bank through the interbank electronic payment system, enabling the seller to receive the sale proceeds on the completion day at the earliest. Compared to the conventional payment method, in which mortgage loan proceeds need to be settled via the solicitors' accounts (Note 3)using physical cheques, PAPT is a faster and safer option. Buyers and sellers who wish to use PAPT may request their estate agents to incorporate relevant clauses into the provisional S&P agreement.

The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue,said, ""The HKMA is committed to promoting electronic payment for property transactions to improve efficiency and security. With the widespread adoption of PAPT in refinancing, it will now be expanded to cover S&P of residential properties in the secondary market. We encourage the public to make good use of this new arrangement. We would also like to extend our sincere gratitude to the LSHK, the EAA, the CC, and other stakeholders for their valuable advice and support in refining the PAPT arrangement, thereby providing buyers and sellers with a safer and more efficient payment option.""

The Chairman of HKAB, and Vice Chairman and Chief Executive of Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited, Mr Sun Yu,said, ""The Hong Kong Association of Banks has conducted research since 2023 to expand the scope of PAPT to cover sale and purchase of residential properties in the secondary market. The feedback gathered from this in-depth study and extensive consultations with the industry and relevant stakeholders helped shape the proposal announced today. The banking industry is now fully prepared across its operating systems, processes, and internal guidelines pertaining to PAPT while training programmes are underway for frontline units to ensure proper implementation. PAPT will provide a reliable electronic payment solution for both buyers and sellers in property transactions, advancing the digital transformation of mortgage lending processes.""

The President of the LSHK, Mr Roden Tong,said, ""Additional Payment Arrangements for Property Transactionsis not a new concept. PAPT has been available for refinancing transactions, and operating smoothly. As electronic payment becomes increasingly common in Hong Kong, the Law Society of Hong Kong considers that the extension of PAPT to sale and purchase of residential properties in the secondary market aligns with times and technological development. The Law Society supports this initiative. Different transaction scenarios may suit different payment arrangements. Solicitors will provide legal advice to clients throughout the process of property transactions to ensure that their interests are protected and the risks are properly managed.""

The Chief Executive Officer of the EAA, Mr Gordon Leung,said, ""The EAA strongly supports the banking industry's expansion of the PAPT to the sale and purchase of residential properties in Hong Kong's secondary market. Over the past year, we have actively communicated with the HKMA and HKAB regarding the details of PAPT, acting as a bridge between them and the estate agency industry. The EAA expects estate agents to actively introduce PAPT to their clients when handling residential property transactions in the secondary market, so that their clients understand the benefits PAPT can bring and make appropriate choices in payment method.""

HKAB has published a leaflet to introduce PAPT for S&P of residential properties in the secondary market. The public may also contact banks offering mortgage service, estate agents, and their solicitors for further details.

Note 1: PAPT was first introduced for residential mortgage refinancing in November 2022, with more than 15 000 transactions completed using PAPT so far. Over 75 per cent of eligible refinancing transactions opted to use PAPT over the past six months.
Note 2: Mortgage banks will provide PAPT for S&P transactions of residential properties in the secondary market in Hong Kong with provisional S&P agreements signed on or after February 28, 2026.
Note 3: The sale proceeds are generally received two working days after completion of a property transaction, following the settlement of physical cheques."
申訴專員公署公布就衞生署轄下香港醫務委員會秘書處就投訴處理所提供的支援及成效、衞生署的相關監管的主動調查行動報告（附圖）,2026-02-05 16:18,2026-02-05 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500449.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（二月五日）宣布申訴專員公署（公署）完成衞生署轄下香港醫務委員會（醫委會）秘書處就處理投訴提供的支援和成效及衞生署的相關監管的主動調查行動，並向當局提出共21項改善建議。

公署留意到有傳媒於去年十月報道醫委會竟拖延處理一宗有關腦癱嬰兒的投訴個案長達15年，而該會秘書處未能解釋延誤原因，醫委會以個案處理時間太長對被投訴的醫生不公而永久擱置聆訊，事件引起社會各界高度關注。其後，再有傳媒報道醫委會延誤處理一宗有關孕婦分娩後死亡的投訴個案，以及一宗病人服食醫生處方藥物後死亡的投訴個案。上述個案的處理時間均接近甚至超過十年，公眾因而極度關注醫委會及秘書處處理投訴的機制及程序有否失當。

陳積志表示：「公署與市民大眾同樣擔憂處理投訴醫生的機制及程序是否妥善及有效，故此公署向衞生署展開主動調查行動。公署在調查屬衞生署編制下的秘書處的過程中，同時發現醫委會現時處理投訴的監察機制在管理和運作上有不少系統性問題及不足之處。基於公署有責任提高公共行政質素和水平，促進行政公平，重大公眾利益的考量及回應市民的憂慮，公署亦會在報告內詳細交代相關發現及觀察，希望能推動及促進政府當局檢視現有法例、制度，以及行政和資源支援上可改善之處，以確保醫委會能有效履行其處理醫療事故投訴的法定職能。」

公署調查顯示，秘書處向醫委會提供行政支援，包括就公眾對註冊醫生專業行為失當的投訴而對事涉醫生進行的調查及紀律處分程序提供行政支援。雖然秘書處職員在公務員編制上隸屬衞生署，但他們均受醫委會直接領導並以醫委會秘書處人員的身分履行職責，以支援醫委會履行《醫生註冊條例》（《條例》）訂明的法定職能。有關註冊醫生投訴個案的處理和進度，均由醫委會直接監督及管理，及要就其成效負責和向公眾交代。

公署認為，秘書處擔任的是秘書及行政支援角色，只為醫委會提供支援服務，並聽命於該會。而醫委會作為獲《條例》賦權的機構，在處理相關投訴事宜上必然擔當着最重要角色。醫委會獲法例賦權的同時，自然亦有相對應的責任需要負上，不應讓市民感覺醫委會與秘書處權責不清。從宏觀角度而言，政府當局對醫療業界亦有整體監督角色。

就投訴個案處理時間方面，政府於二○一八年修訂《條例》，目標之一是期望醫委會能盡快於三年內清除當時超過700宗的積壓個案，並於之後兩年內完成處理大部分需要進行研訊的個案。二○一九年及二○二○年因黑暴造成社會動盪期間，醫委會接獲投訴因而分別急升至3 286及3 356宗，遠超之前五年的每年平均576宗。在二○二○年至二○二五年期間，醫委會以研訊方式完成處理共263宗個案（平均約每年44宗）。由接獲個案的日期起計至完成研訊，當中超過七成半的個案在五年內完成，但有少數個案需時甚長，例如有11宗個案（4%）竟需10至15年才完成處理，顯示醫委會處理投訴個案的效率確實仍未達當時修例的目標。然而，對比二○一八年修訂《條例》及其前5年（即二○一三年至二○一七年）共132宗以研訊方式完成處理的個案（平均每年約21宗），目前的研訊處理量已增加超過一倍。

根據《條例》，醫委會處理投訴個案涉及獨立準司法程序，過程中需要保障各方的合法權利和充分參與、確保程序公義，部分投訴可能涉及繁複的程序。然而，整體而言，目前對醫生的投訴調查和紀律研訊過程過長實與公眾期望相距甚遠。上述情況對於投訴及被投訴者雙方均構成嚴重影響甚或不公，若個案中涉及嚴重專業行為失當而失當確實存在，更可能對病人安全構成風險。秘書處應在行政上更着力協助醫委會在個案管理上權衡輕重，有效履行《條例》賦予醫委會的獨立準司法職能和權力。

在二○二○年至二○二五年，已完成研訊的個案在各個階段的整體處理時間中位數：初步偵訊委員會（偵委會）初步考慮階段為10.4個月、偵委會階段為14個月，研訊階段為11個月。不過，有個別個案在偵委會初步考慮階段、偵委會階段及研訊階段中需時甚久，例如有個案在偵委會初步考慮階段的處理時間竟為102.1個月（即約8年半），當中涉及空窗期。

截至二○二五年十二月，醫委會共有895宗未完成處理的投訴個案。這些個案中，大部分由接獲起計在兩年以下（755宗（84%））。不過，有少數個案在醫委會接獲後的處理時間極長，例如有個案在醫委會接獲後七年而目前處於偵委會初步考慮階段。

公署欣悉，自《條例》於二○一八年修訂以來，醫委會每年完成處理的個案數量已有明顯增加，研訊時間亦有縮減。公署亦理解個案數量曾急升的情況，並欣悉為進一步改善投訴處理效率，醫委會主動於去年一月作出檢討並推行措施，包括指派高級人員統籌及監察個案進度，建立雙層監察機制；強化投訴資訊系統的個案追蹤功能，並就所有進行中個案作全面檢核及更新；以及定期編製每月進度報告以作檢視及跟進等，加強對投訴個案的監察、優化工作分配和流程、堵塞漏洞、紓緩瓶頸問題，務求提升整體工作效率。公署對醫委會主動作出檢討並推行措施予以肯定，有關措施確有正面作用。

不過，公署認為，上述各項統計數字反映醫委會處理投訴個案進度仍然過於緩慢，個案長期積壓的情況持續，實有迫切需要作出認真檢討並徹底改善投訴處理的流程。

公署認為，政府當局應促請秘書處着力支援醫委會檢視投訴流程、實質加強監察個案進度，積極切實加快處理投訴個案，並必須先盡快清理積壓個案。

公署亦發現，衞生署評核全為該署職員的秘書處人員的工作表現時並沒有徵詢醫委會的意見，反映衞生署與醫委會溝通不足。此外，公署亦質疑衞生署如何能多年來在沒有徵詢醫委會意見的情況下評核秘書處職員的工作表現。公署認為，衞生署與醫委會應設立審核秘書處職員表現的溝通機制，而衞生署亦應訂立客觀評核標準，作為秘書處職員評核的基礎。

公署並發現醫委會其他可改善之處，包括主動向投訴人了解個案是否同時涉及須向死因裁判官呈報的情況、考慮善用死因研訊所得資料，以及須主動詢問無須於紀律研訊擔任證人的投訴人在研訊過程需否即時傳譯服務等。

陳積志表示：「公署理解，醫委會將個案轉呈研訊小組進行研訊的決定乃按相關法例作出。另一方面，公眾或不太清楚醫委會的投訴處理程序，但從數字上來看，絕大部分的個案不獲轉呈至研訊小組，難免讓公眾產生疑慮。公署認為，政府當局應提醒醫委會，提升投訴個案處理的透明度，令公眾知悉投訴未能跟進或成立的原因，幫助市民了解醫委會的規管角色及責任，及其投訴處理機制的內容和目的，從而維繫社會對本港醫療規管制度的信心。

「公署期望醫委會能繼續精益求精，切實履行該會『行公義，守專業，護社羣』的使命，不負投訴人、被投訴人、社會及市民大眾的重託。」

公署向政府當局提出的主要改善建議包括：


鼓勵醫委會按良好公共行政原則，包括有效、公平、合理、適切、以民為本、開放態度等，促進醫委會本身及要求業界對良好公共行政的追求及對公眾期望的了解及積極和快速處理市民對醫生涉嫌專業行為失當的投訴；




促請秘書處支援醫委會制訂行政指引確保投訴處理機制有效運作，例如考慮訂定並公布合理和有效的主要投訴處理階段的時間指標，認真向投訴及被投訴人負責；




促請醫委會切實考慮精簡程序，例如在紀律研訊中使用法庭審訊中確立的事實或邀請在死因研訊擔任證人的專家擔任專家證人，從而節省須考慮新專家的意見而要發回偵委會處理的程序及時間；




促請醫委會妥善履行該會對秘書處的實質監督角色，包括要求秘書處必須全力配合醫委會的工作，清晰匯報個案進度及積壓情況；




促請醫委會加強秘書處人員的管理及績效監管；




明確確立醫委會的權責及醫委會要向社會及市民大眾負責；




平衡專業自主和公平開放向社會問責的原則和社會期望，借鏡其他地方經驗，政府當局應積極考慮適當地增加醫委會的業外委員比例，廣泛吸納社會各界的知識、經驗和意見，從而全面優化管治制度和架構；




完善法例，加強醫委會覆檢個案的機制，包括容讓投訴人直接向醫委會提出覆檢要求，從而保障投訴人及被投訴人的基本權益，以及加強公眾對處理有關投訴的機制的信心；




促請秘書處在不影響公正性的情況下盡量定期通知投訴人及被投訴醫生個案進度；




衞生署評核秘書處的秘書處職員的工作時必須徵詢醫委會的意見；




衞生署評核秘書處職員的工作時應訂立及考慮客觀標準，例如個案處理效率、積壓情況等；以及




考慮就不涉及醫護專業人員操守的醫療爭議個案引入調解的可行性。


公署提出的21項建議，全部已獲政府當局接納。

Ombudsman announces results of direct investigation operation into effectiveness of administrative support provided for complaint handling by Secretariat of Medical Council of Hong Kong under Department of Health and Department of Health's regulatory role (with photos),2026-02-05 16:18,2026-02-05 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500480.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

  The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (February 5) announced the completion of a direct investigation operation into the effectiveness of administrative support provided for complaint handling by the Secretariat of the Medical Council of Hong Kong (MCHK) under the Department of Health (DH), and the DH's regulatory role. The Office of The Ombudsman (the Office) made 21 improvement recommendations to the authorities.

  It has come to the attention of the Office that in October 2025, some media reported on a 15-year delay by the MCHK in handling a complaint concerning an infant left with cerebral palsy, while the MCHK Secretariat (the Secretariat) was unable to explain the delay. The MCHK stayed the proceedings permanently on the grounds that too much time had passed for the medical practitioner under complaint to be given a fair hearing. The incident raised significant public concern from all sectors. Subsequently, further media reports emerged alleging that the MCHK had delayed handling complaints involving the death of a woman after childbirth, and the death of a patient after taking prescribed medication. All the above cases were outstanding for nearly 10 years or even longer. The public is therefore extremely concerned about any inadequacies in the mechanism and process of the MCHK and its Secretariat for handling complaints.

  Mr Chan said, ""The Office shares the wide community concern about whether a proper and effective mechanism and process are in place for handling complaints against medical practitioners. We, therefore, initiated a direct investigation operation into the DH. During our investigation into the Secretariat under the DH's establishment, the Office also found systemic issues and inadequacies in the management and operation of the MCHK's complaint-handling and monitoring mechanism. Given the Office's duty to enhance the quality and standards of public administration, promote administrative fairness, take into account significant public interest and respond to community concerns, we also give a detailed account of relevant findings and observations in this report. We endeavour to promote and facilitate the Government's review of any room for improvement in existing legislation, systems, administrative support and resource allocation, thereby ensuring that the MCHK can effectively fulfil its statutory functions on handling complaints against medical practitioners.""

  The Office's investigation found that the Secretariat provides the MCHK with administrative support, including that for investigations and disciplinary proceedings into public complaints against registered medical practitioners for professional misconduct. While Secretariat staff are all civil servants under the DH's establishment, they are under the direct leadership of the MCHK and perform duties as Secretariat staff to support the MCHK in discharging its statutory functions under the Medical Registration Ordinance (MRO). The MCHK directly supervises and manages the handling and progress of complaints against registered medical practitioners, and is accountable to the public for its effectiveness.

  As the Secretariat's role is to provide secretarial and administrative support, the Office considers its functions to be solely providing the MCHK with support service and acting under the latter's direction. The MCHK, as the organisation vested with this power by the MRO, certainly plays the most important role in handling such complaints. The powers conferred on the MCHK by the law naturally entail corresponding responsibilities, and should not leave an impression with the public on an unclear delineation of responsibilities between the MCHK and the Secretariat. From a macro perspective, the Government has an overall supervisory role over the healthcare sector.

  Regarding the complaint processing time, the Government amended the MRO in 2018. One of the objectives was to clear the MCHK's then existing backlog of over 700 cases within three years, followed by the completion of most inquiry cases within the two years thereafter. During the social unrest stemming from the riots in 2019 and 2020, the number of complaints received by the MCHK surged to 3 286 and 3 356 respectively, far exceeding the annual average of 576 complaints over the preceding five years. Between 2020 and 2025, the MCHK completed a total of 263 cases by inquiry, or an annual average of 44 cases. From receiving a complaint to completing the inquiry, more than 75 per cent were completed within five years, but a few cases took much longer, including 11 cases (4 per cent) which took as much as 10 to 15 years. Evidently, the MCHK's efficiency in complaint handling fell short of the objectives set upon the legislative amendment. However, compared with the 132 cases (or an annual average of 21 cases) completed by inquiry in the five years (i.e. from 2013 to 2017) preceding the 2018 amendment to the MRO, the current number of cases handled by inquiry has more than doubled.

  Pursuant to the MRO, the MCHK's complaint handling involves independent quasi-judicial proceedings, during which it is essential to safeguard the legitimate rights and full participation of all parties, and ensure procedural justice. Some complaints may involve complex procedures. However, overall speaking, the current investigations and disciplinary proceedings into complaints against medical practitioners are excessively long and fall far short of public expectations. This situation has serious implications, and may cause unfairness, for both complainants and complainees. Cases involving serious professional misconduct, if it has really existed, may even pose a risk to patient safety. The Secretariat should make more effort to provide administrative support in managing and prioritising complaints, thereby facilitating the MCHK's effective exercise of its quasi-judicial functions and powers under the MRO.

  Between 2020 and 2025, the median processing time for each stage of completed inquiry cases was as follows: 10.4 months for the initial consideration stage by a Preliminary Investigation Committee (PIC), 14 months for the PIC deliberation stage and 11 months for the inquiry stage. Yet, certain cases took a significantly long time at the initial consideration, PIC deliberation and inquiry stages. For instance, one case took 102.1 months (or around 8.5 years) at the initial consideration stage by the PIC, probably with periods of inaction.

  As of December 2025, the MCHK had a backlog of 895 complaint cases, of which, most were outstanding for less than two years from the date of receiving the complaint (755 cases or 84 per cent). However, a small fraction of cases were outstanding for extremely long periods, including a case which is now at the pre-PIC stage seven years after being received by the MCHK.

  The Office is pleased to note that since the 2018 amendment to the MRO, the number of cases completed by the MCHK each year has increased significantly, and the time taken for inquiries has been shortened. The Office also recognises the surge in cases stemming from past circumstances, and notes that the MCHK undertook a review in January 2025 with measures implemented to improve the efficiency of complaint handling, such as assigning senior officers to co-ordinate and monitor the progress of cases, with a dual-track mechanism established for monitoring; enhancing the case tracking functionality of the complaints information system, and comprehensively reviewing and updating all ongoing cases; and regularly compiling monthly progress reports for review and follow-up. These measures aim to enhance overall operational efficiency through strengthened monitoring of complaint cases, optimising workload distribution and workflows, plug the loopholes identified and resolve bottlenecks. The Office commends the MCHK for proactively undertaking a review and implementing measures with positive results.

  Nevertheless, the Office considers that the statistics cited above reflect that the MCHK's progress in complaint handling is still too slow, resulting in a persistent backlog of cases. There remains an urgent need to critically review and thoroughly improve the complaint-handling process.

  The Office considers that the Government should urge the Secretariat to use its best efforts to support the MCHK's review of complaint-handling procedures, substantially strengthen the monitoring of the progress of cases, effectively expedite the handling of complaint cases, and clear the backlog as soon as possible.

  The Office also found that the DH conducts the performance appraisals of Secretariat staff, all of whom are DH staff, without consulting the MCHK. This indicates a lack of communication between the DH and the MCHK. Moreover, it is questionable how the DH could assess the performance of Secretariat staff without consulting the MCHK over the years. The Office recommends that the DH establish a communication mechanism with the MCHK to assess the performance of Secretariat staff, and draw up objective criteria as the basis for the appraisals of Secretariat staff.

  The Office also identified several other improvement areas required of the MCHK, including ascertaining with complainants whether a case also involves circumstances requiring referral to the coroner, considering how to make effective use of information from inquests, and reaching out to complainants not required to testify at disciplinary inquiries to ascertain whether they need simultaneous interpretation service during the proceedings.

  Mr Chan said, ""The Office recognises that the MCHK's decision to refer cases to an inquiry panel for inquiry is based on relevant legislation. On the other hand, the public may not be fully aware of the MCHK's complaint handling procedures. Statistically, the fact that most cases are not referred to an inquiry panel can raise public doubt. The Office considers that the Government should remind the MCHK to enhance transparency in complaint handling, and explain to the public why some complaints are not pursued or substantiated. This will enable the public to understand the MCHK's regulatory role and responsibilities, as well as the substance and purpose of its complaint handling mechanism, thereby upholding society's confidence in the regulatory system over the healthcare sector in Hong Kong.

  ""The Office urges the MCHK to continue striving for excellence, diligently fulfilling its mission of ensuring justice, maintaining professionalism and protecting the public, and proving itself worthy of the trust of complainants, complainees, society and the public.""

  The Office's major recommendations for improvement to the authorities include:


Encouraging the MCHK to draw on the principles of good public administration, including efficiency, fairness, reasonable and proper conduct, having a people-oriented mindset and openness. It should promote awareness within the MCHK and request the sector to understand the pursuit of good public administration and public expectations, and expedite the handling of public complaints against medical practitioners for alleged professional misconduct;




Urging the Secretariat to support the MCHK's formulation of administrative guidelines to ensure the effective operation of its complaint-handling process. For instance, it should consider setting and publishing reasonable and effective target timelines for each key stage of complaint handling, thereby seriously discharging its obligations towards complainants and complainees;




Urging the MCHK to critically explore streamlining procedures, such as adopting the facts established by the court, or inviting experts who have testified at an inquest to serve as expert witnesses in the MCHK's disciplinary inquiry to save time for remitting cases back to the PIC due to new expert opinions;




Urging the MCHK to perform diligently its substantive supervisory duties over the Secretariat, including requiring the Secretariat to fully support the MCHK's work with clear reporting on the progress of the case and backlog status;




Urging the MCHK to step up the management and performance supervision of Secretariat staff;




Explicitly stipulating the MCHK's powers and responsibilities and ensuring that the MCHK is accountable to society and the public;




To strike a balance between professional autonomy on one hand, and the principles of fairness, openness and social accountability and public expectations on the other, and in light of overseas experience, the authorities should consider properly increasing the proportion of lay members in the MCHK to widely incorporate knowledge, experience and views from all sectors of society, thereby comprehensively optimising the governance system and structure;




Enhancing the legislation to strengthen the MCHK's complaint review mechanism, including allowing complainants to request a review by the MCHK directly, thereby safeguarding the basic rights of complainants and complainees, and strengthening public confidence in the mechanism for handling complaints;




Without compromising the fairness, urging the MCHK to provide complainants and complainees with regular updates on case progress as far as possible;




The DH should consult the MCHK when conducting performance appraisals for Secretariat staff;




The DH should adopt and consider objective criteria, such as case processing efficiency and backlog status, for the performance appraisals of Secretariat staff; and




Exploring the feasibility of resolving medical disputes that do not involve professional conduct of medical practitioners by mediation.


  All 21 recommendations made are accepted by the authorities.

Professor Jason Yam (President of Asia-Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology 2026 Congress), Professor Tetsuro Oshika (President of Asia-Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology), Professor Richard Abbott (President of Academia Ophthalmologica Internationalis), Dr Hong Wah Yung (President of the College of Ophthalmologists of Hong Kong, Dr Yung Hong-wah), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  A very warm welcome to Hong Kong. It is my great pleasure to join you today at the 41st Asia-Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology Congress.

  Bringing together thousands of esteemed experts from around the globe, this year's Congress is held in conjunction with the Hong Kong Ophthalmological Symposium. Together, they serve as an ideal platform for exploring the latest advancements in visual sciences and ophthalmology.

  Hong Kong is well placed to host this meaningful gathering. Our city has long been devoted to building a robust medical system - one that serves our community and contributes to global health dialogues.

  Hong Kong enjoys one of the best healthcare systems in the world, offering affordable, accessible, and quality medical care. Our healthcare system, one that we take pride in, consistently aligns with international standards and is known for its credibility and efficiency. It helps to make Hong Kong a city with one of the highest life expectancies worldwide and contributes to our remarkable health outcomes, like a low infant mortality rate.

  Similar to many developed economies, Hong Kong's population is ageing. That leads to an inevitable surge in chronic diseases. To address our evolving healthcare challenges, the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is taking forward a range of initiatives to enhance the sustainability of Hong Kong's healthcare system. These include strengthening primary healthcare, promoting health and medical innovation, as well as encouraging collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

  In particular, we are committed to improving ophthalmic services, recognising the continuous growth of public demand in this vital area of healthcare.

  We are working to enhance ophthalmic services by strengthening training for professional personnel, introducing innovative medications, and setting up a new high-capacity cataract surgery centre. These initiatives are designed to increase service capacity and shorten waiting times, while maintaining the safety and quality in eye care service delivery.

  We believe that prevention is always better than cure, and that's why safeguarding the visual health of our future generation remains a priority. The Government has been providing free visual assessment services for children and adolescents annually, from birth until secondary school graduation. These essential services facilitate early identification of visual acuity problems and, in turn, provide better support for our young people's lifelong visual health.

  Investing in ophthalmology and eye care is crucial to all of society. A population with good visual health enables citizens to actively participate in the community and lead more fulfilling lives.

  In this regard, I would like to express my gratitude to the Asia-Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology and the Hong Kong Ophthalmological Society for co-organising today's event. It provides an invaluable opportunity for academics, experts, and professionals in the field to share insights and experiences on current developments and challenges. I am confident that the upcoming peer learning and knowledge exchange will be rewarding and constructive for all of you.

  As the saying goes, ""Eyes are the windows to the soul."" May our shared vision for better visual health illuminate the path towards greater well-being for all.

  I wish you all a fruitful event and a wonderful stay with us here. Thank you."

主席：

感謝陳家珮議員提出的議案、六位議員提出的修正案。剛才仔細聽到合共41位議員就教育範疇提供的寶貴意見，內容涵蓋人工智能教育、數字教育、職業專才教育、STEAM（科學、科技、工程、藝術和數學）教育、國際學校的發展、非華語學生學習中文的情況、北部都會區大學城的建設、非本地學生來港就學等議題，我表示衷心的感謝。

中小學人工智能教育

多位議員就中小學人工智能教育提出的真知灼見，與教育局成立的數字教育策略發展督導委員會的發展方向高度契合。為配合國家《十五五規劃建議》提出的教育數字化戰略和教育強國、科教興國及創新驅動發展等方向，教育局持續加大力度於學校推進數字教育，並將於今年發布《中小學數字教育發展藍圖》，包括優化中小學銜接的資訊及創科教育課程、《人工智能素養學習架構》、加強教師的人工智能培訓，以及與相關專業團體協作，一同營造校園數字教育氛圍，提升學生的人工智能素養。目前我們正就制訂藍圖積極聽取持份者意見。

另一方面，良好的數理教育是培育創科人才的關鍵。我們正檢視高中科學科目及數學科延伸部分的課程設置，為學生同時修讀多個科學科目和數學科延伸部分創造更加有利的條件。教育局亦將於今年年底前，就高中數理課程設置提出優化方向和實施建議。

支援大學推動人工智能／科技教育

專上教育方面，政府一直鼓勵院校開辦切合香港發展所需的課程，壯大創科等重點範疇的人才庫，加強香港的競爭力；並提出在二○二六／二七學年，大學教育資助委員會（教資會）資助大學的學生當中，有百分之三十五修讀STEAM學科，以及百分之六十修讀與國家「十四五」規劃下香港發展成為「八大中心」相關的學科，當中包括創新科技。我們聯同教資會將透過三年期規劃工作，與大學攜手向目標邁進，培訓更多切合香港策略發展需要的人才。

政府亦重視職業專才教育（職專教育），並且積極推動應用科學大學的發展，強化職專教育在學位程度的地位。我們會繼續以「職學聯通、多元發展」的策略，培育更多掌握應用技能，包括人工智能技能的高質量人才，以應對香港乃至國家對掌握應用知識及技能的人力的殷切需求。

國際學校學額及宿位

國際學校的學額方面，政府一直致力支持國際學校體系的蓬勃發展，以滿足非本地家庭的需要。當預期有國際學校學額不足情況時，教育局會通過公開公平的競逐方法分配全新土地或空置校舍作國際學校用途，以增加國際學校學額。因此，因應近年各項來港的人才計劃反應熱烈，教育局已通過校舍分配工作分配兩所空置校舍以增加學額。為應對長遠需要，我們亦在北部都會區預留土地發展國際學校。此外，我們鼓勵國際學校提高收生名額，並會拆牆鬆綁，容許優質國際學校以自資模式在校舍用地增建及優化設施，包括學生宿舍。教育局會繼續密切留意國際學校學額的供求情況，適時作出跟進。

主席，教育局會繼續推動教育界迎變求進，大力推進人工智能教育，培育數字時代的創科人才，一體推進教育科技人才發展，為國家在二○三五年建成教育強國貢獻力量。

多謝主席。"
立法會：醫務衞生局副局長就「制訂發展策略，應對人口挑戰」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2026-02-05 15:26,2026-02-05 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500510.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局副局長范婉雯醫生今日（二月五日）在立法會會議就「制訂發展策略，應對人口挑戰」議員議案的總結發言：

主席：

我感謝陳家珮議員提出這項議案、六位議員提出的修正案，以及各位議員的意見。

香港擁有高水平的醫療專業和高效率的醫療系統，為全球人均壽命最長而嬰兒死亡率最低的地區之一。二○二三至二四年度香港公共醫療衞生經常性開支相對本地生產總值的百分比只為4.3%，與其他人口老化程度相若的經濟體比較，香港的相關開支比例屬於最低的地區之一，彰顯了公營醫療系統的效率。值得注意的是，長者對醫療服務需求遠比其他年齡群組為多，隨着香港人口結構老齡化及醫療科技日新月異，醫療開支持續上升無可避免。特區政府會因應人口結構轉變，持續調整和優化醫療政策，確保醫療服務可持續發展。我在此就醫療服務對營造友善生育環境、輔助生育服務及長者支援等方面作簡單總結和回應。

（一）營造友善生育環境

政府推動孕產婦友善措施，為孕婦設立關愛窗口，方便輪候醫療服務，亦會優化及整合相關資訊平台，加強向婦女提供懷孕各階段所需的健康資訊和實用指引。現時，衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院與醫管局（醫院管理局）轄下的產科部門合作，提供一套完善的產前護理計劃和連貫的產後健康服務，全面支援新手媽媽及初生嬰兒，保障母嬰健康。同時，基層醫療署亦計劃於二○二六年在樂妍站及地區康健中心／站免費提供孕前及產前產後所需要的班組活動，支援婦女及其伴侶的健康生活。

（二）輔助生育服務

輔助生育方面，人類生殖科技管理局亦修訂相關附屬法例，於二○二五年十二月一日已生效，取消供自用的配子和胚胎的法定儲存期限，讓市民可因應自身健康及其他情況決定配子和胚胎的儲存期限，讓大家有更大靈活性和更好地體現生育自主權。另外，醫管局自二○二四／二五年度起，會於五年內逐步增加資助的體外受精治療名額，由現時每年1 100個治療周期，增至每年1 800個。

政府亦於二○二四／二五課稅年度起，設立輔助生育服務開支扣除，（每個課稅年度的扣除）上限為10萬元，以減輕面對生育困難的夫婦的財政壓力，鼓勵他們尋求所需的醫療協助。

（三）打造長者友善環境

面對人口老化和慢性疾病病患率上升，政府正按《基層醫療健康藍圖》落實一系列改革措施，包括公私營界別共同治理計劃以提早識別有健康風險的市民；整合衞生署長者健康中心服務至地區康健網絡；優化長者醫療券，包括透過獎賞計劃和擴展大灣區試點計劃至大灣區內地九市全覆蓋，鼓勵長者善用醫療券提升健康。

醫管局會透過跨專業醫護團隊推行多項支援服務，協助長者可居家安老，包括離院長者綜合支援計劃，為離院後較高機會再次入院的長者加強過渡性的綜合支援服務；社區老人評估小組會定期前往安老院舍為體弱長者提供醫療及護理治療，並透過安老院舍晚期醫護服務支援居於院舍中患有末期疾病的人士。此外，家庭醫學門診可提供健康風險評估及針對性護理等基層醫療服務。「護訊鈴」亦為出院後的高風險長者病人提供電話支援服務，協助監察病情。

衞生署轄下的長者健康服務由18間長者健康中心及18支長者健康外展分隊組成，為社區的長者提供基層健康護理服務，提高他們自我照顧的能力，鼓勵他們建立良好的生活習慣，希望能推動大家為護老者給予支援，以減低長者患病的機會。

FEHD takes stringent enforcement actions against fresh provision shops with unsatisfactory hygiene conditions and causing rodent infestation,2026-02-05 15:00,2026-02-05 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020400772.htm,"  A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (February 5) that, as revealed in recent inspections, some fresh provision shops (FPSs) selling fresh meat were in poor hygienic conditions and had improper handling, storage and keeping of fresh meat, posing a higher risk of rodent infestation. Over the past three days (February 2 to 4), the FEHD carried out special operations in various districts across the territory to strengthen inspections of more than 250 licensed FPSs and take stringent enforcement actions against relevant irregularities, with a view to reducing public health risks.

  In the special operations, the focuses of the FEHD's inspections included (i) whether the handling, storage and covering of fresh meat and other food meet hygiene requirements; (ii) whether the collection, storage and disposal of refuse, food leftovers and sewage are proper; (iii) whether miscellaneous articles, utensils or goods are improperly placed in rear lanes and back-up areas of the premises, which could create hiding places for rodents; (iv) whether there are structural defects in the premises (such as holes, gaps, or breaks in sewer pipes) that ease the entry and exit of rodents; (v) whether the premises have prepared and implemented effective pest control measures; and (vi) whether the overall hygienic condition of the premises complies with standards. Against irregularities in the aforesaid areas, the FEHD staff initiated 47 prosecutions and issued 101 verbal warnings/advice against the FPSs concerned.

  The spokesman pointed out that business operators' failure to properly manage food premises and pay attention to the aforesaid areas will provide food sources and hiding places for rodents, posing a higher risk of rodent infestation, causing environmental hygiene problems and constituting threats to food safety.

  The spokesman stressed that the FEHD will continue to step up inspections across all districts and take stringent enforcement actions against irregularities in accordance with the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132) and its subsidiary legislation."

主席：

我感謝共41位議員就議案提出的寶貴意見。我將就營造生育友好環境、人力資源發展和打造長者友善環境的相關工作作簡單回應。

營造生育友好環境

勞福局一直致力營造生育友好環境，支援在職家庭育兒，釋放家庭勞動力，資助非政府機構提供兒童照顧服務，包括幼兒中心服務、社區保姆（鄰里支援幼兒照顧計劃）和課餘託管服務等。政府會進一步加強日間嬰幼兒照顧服務和推行學前兒童課餘託管服務及在校課後託管服務。同時，政府會持續透過在職家庭津貼計劃支援低收入在職家庭，紓緩他們的經濟負擔，鼓勵更多家庭投身勞動市場。

人力資源發展

在人力資源規劃方面，政府一直因應社會發展和人力需求趨勢優化本地培訓提高生產力和競爭力，同時也因應需要，積極「搶人才」和「留人才」，為香港的經濟社會發展注入動力。

僱員再培訓局（再培訓局）現正進行全面改革，目標是提供「技能為本」的培訓課程和策略，推動所有階層及學歷的勞動人口持續進修以提升技能，當中包括大家都十分關心的，對人工智能應用的認識和掌握。

此外，為釋放銀髮勞動力，再培訓局致力協助50歲或以上較年長人士了解就業市場情況，並提供切合他們的培訓課程。而由勞工處負責的「再就業津貼試行計劃」，鼓勵40歲或以上人士重投就業市場。勞工處現正就該計劃進行中期檢討，配合「中高齡就業計劃」，探討進一步鼓勵銀齡就業的措施。

輸入優質的外來人才毫無疑問是補充本地人口及勞動力的最直接和快捷的方法。政府會在致力保障本地人士優先就業的大前提下招攬外來人才。自二○二二年底開始，政府推出多項「搶人才」、「留人才」措施，已成功吸引超過26萬人才來港工作和發展。來港人才以年輕群體為主，他們為本地勞動力注入創新與多元技能，有助紓緩人口高齡化的挑戰。政府會動態監察香港人力變化，不時因應人才需求檢視人才清單和各項招攬人才措施。

長者照顧服務

面對人口老化的挑戰，政府將貫徹「居家安老為本，院舍照顧為後援」的方針，加強安老服務。政府推出長者社區照顧服務券和長者院舍照顧服務券，讓合資格長者在「錢跟人走」和共同付款的模式下自由選擇切合他們需要的服務。政府同時推行「廣東院舍照顧服務計劃」（廣東院舍計劃），為輪候資助宿位的長者提供更多選擇。同時，政府亦正推行試驗計劃，資助綜援受助長者入住廣東院舍計劃的安老院，以提升生活質素。為支援長者應對跨境養老醫療開支，政府已推出為期兩年的醫療補貼試行安排，為參加廣東院舍計劃的長者分擔在國家醫保項目下須自付的醫療開支。

政府亦積極善用樂齡科技，提升長者的生活質素及減輕照顧者的壓力，包括為高風險照顧者住戶試行安裝智能意外偵測系統，達致即時偵測家居意外、及早介入、迅速援助的效果。另外，政府亦先後注資二十億元設立及強化「樂齡及康復創科應用基金」，讓合資格安老及康復服務單位購置、租用或試用科技產品，並擴闊用途至適合家居使用，方便長者於家居使用樂齡科技產品。

結語

勞褔局現正開展人力推算的中期更新工作，綜合評估環球及本地最新發展對二○二八年人力情況的影響，預計在今年第四季公布結果。政府統計處亦會於今年進行人口普查，搜集本港人口的最新基準資料，並會在普查結果備妥後綜合最新數據和政策因素更新人口推算。兩項推算結果將有助相關政策局在不同範疇制訂可持續發展策略，應對人口挑戰。

主席，在行政長官、司長和副司長的督導下，各政策局會繼續各司其職，跨局相互協作，因應社會及人口最新情況策劃及推行與人口相關的各種政策措施。我代表政府再次感謝各位議員就人口政策規劃提出寶貴意見。

多謝主席。"

主席：

陳家珮議員提出的議案建議政府研究延遲全體公務員的退休年齡至65歲，幾位動議修正案的議員也支持；林琳議員建議研究採取更積極靈活的措施，吸引有能力的公務員退休後在政府服務；而梁美芬議員建議讓希望繼續工作的公務員在達到退休年齡後繼續工作。在剛才辯論進行期間，我亦聽了多位議員對於留住銀髮公務員繼續服務政府的意見。我現作綜合回覆。

對於原議案的建議，即全面提升公務員退休年齡至65歲，其實政府很大程度上已做到這一點。早在超過10年前，政府考慮到人口高齡化的趨勢及勞動人口數字的推算後，為配合增加勞動力的目標，自二○一五年六月起，已將新入職文職和紀律部隊職系公務員的退休年齡分別提高至65歲和60歲。此外，政府亦於二○一八年推出方案，讓在二○○○年六月一日至二○一五年五月三十一日期間入職政府的公務員選擇延遲退休。在合資格公務員當中，約83%選擇延遲退休。目前，七成的現職公務員可按新的退休年齡退休，即文職職系為65歲和紀律部隊職系為60歲。面對近年科技的發展，我們的挑戰，正如原議案及多位議員所說，是提升現職公務員的數字素養、人工智能教育及技能培訓等，而不是一個全面的量的問題，因此我們不擬就餘下三成退休年齡為60歲的公務員提高退休年齡，亦沒有計劃進一步提高其他公務員的退休年齡。

其實，如果我們不論經驗、技能或市場供應，提升政府僱員退休年齡，會令年輕公務員因晉升前景受影響而流失。公務員隊伍在保留經驗和加入新血間取得適當平衡，亦有助公務員隊伍加入具備新時代需要的素養的成員。

但我非常同意，達到退休年齡的公務員如具備政府缺乏的經驗或技能，我們要有適當的措施吸引他們繼續為政府工作。政府現時設有各項延長公務員服務年期的措施，容許部門在有運作需要時可為個別人員延長最多五年的服務任期，即文職人員可以工作至最高70歲，紀律部隊人員可以服務至最高65歲。以退休後服務合約形式聘任的人員，我們則不設年齡上限，在符合總受僱期規限不超過五年的情況下，如果他不是退休後立即受僱及連續受僱，其實是可以工作至超過70歲。各項延長公務員服務年期的措施已經給予部門充分彈性處理人手和運作需要，同時確保公務員團隊可透過健康的更替，保持活力與幹勁，持續提升公共服務的質量和效率。

立法會：商務及經濟發展局副局長就「制訂發展策略，應對人口挑戰」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2026-02-05 13:47,2026-02-05 14:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500378.htm,"以下是商務及經濟發展局（商經局）副局長陳百里博士今日（二月五日）在立法會會議上就陳家珮議員動議的「制訂發展策略，應對人口挑戰」議案的總結發言：

主席：

我感謝提出議案的陳家珮議員、提出修正案的六位議員，以及一共41位議員提出寶貴的意見。隨着長者人口持續上升，加上長者勞動人口參與率近年亦有顯著升幅，銀髮一族的確是香港一個龐大的消費群體，並帶動長者樂齡產品及服務需求。

政府成立的促進銀髮經濟工作組去年年中宣布推出共30項措施，循促進「銀色消費」、發展「銀色產業」、推廣「銀色品質保證」、推廣「銀色財務及保障安排」及釋放「銀色生產動力」五個範疇促進銀髮經濟。

其中，商經局負責促進「銀色消費」和推廣「銀色品質保證」，至今取得正面成果。

在促進「銀色消費」方面，商經局與業界合作，在多個展覽加強銀髮經濟元素，匯聚與長者生活息息相關的產品和服務。我們亦通過電商平台「香港‧設計廊」與香港社會服務聯會（社聯）合作，透過在實體店和本地網上店銷售樂齡產品，使更多銀髮產品提供者把握電商平台的銷售機遇，並方便銀髮一族消費。在商經局的推動下，多間主要連鎖餐飲集團及食品公司已推出軟餐，為有吞嚥困難的長者提供合適的餐飲選擇。此外，消費者委員會已成立銀髮經濟諮詢小組，並在一月三十一日推出「樂齡消費一站通」，為長者提供一站式消費者資訊平台，加強保障長者消費權益。

在推廣「銀色品質保證」方面，商經局一直積極推動業界發揮香港檢測技術和專業認證的優勢，以研究和制定銀色產品和服務的標準或指引，為銀髮消費者提供更優質的選擇。其中，在商經局的支持下，《適老易食食品（適老照護食）通用要求》去年九月正式納入粵港澳大灣區標準（「灣區標準」）清單。社聯和香港中華廠商聯合會亦積極推廣此項「灣區標準」，助力業界提升軟餐產品質素，並拓展銷售網絡至粵港澳三地。此外，香港工業總會的「香港Q嘜樂悠計劃」於去年十一月正式推出，透過認證樂齡產品和服務，促進業界提升相關產品和服務的質量。香港品質保證局亦於去年五月推出「香港註冊—銀髮友善系列」，為銀髮消費者釐定相關準則，進一步開拓銀髮市場。

商經局會繼續推動業界促進「銀色消費」及推廣「銀色品質保證」，以開拓更多不同領域的銀色產品和服務，促進銀髮經濟，讓長者的生活質素得到提升，同時建構及帶動本地新經濟發展機遇。

主席，我謹此陳辭。"

Sunny（香港生產力促進局（生產力局）主席陳祖恒）、 Mohamed（生產力局總裁畢堅文）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家上午好！我非常高興出席今天由香港生產力促進局主辦的「AI with HKPC」智慧AI方案展開幕禮。這項為期三天的活動聚焦中小企業、教育界及物業管理行業的AI應用與轉型，內容豐富、形式多樣，相信能夠為參與者帶來實用的啓發與寶貴交流的機會。

國家「十五五」規劃建議明確支持香港建設為國際創新科技中心。人工智能作為香港轉型升級的關鍵產業，特區政府將全力推動人工智能發展，繼續貫徹「強化基礎設施、促進應用導向」的發展策略，推動AI技術與各行各業深度融合，主動對接國家「人工智能+」行動。

特區政府一直循科研、算力、數據、人才以及資金等方面全方位推動AI發展，穩步推進多項政策措施。現有的AIR@InnoHK研發平台，目前已經累積資助16間聚焦人工智能與機械人的實驗室，當中包括研發與推出港產大模型的香港生成式人工智能研發中心。此外，我們正在積極籌備於今年內正式成立香港人工智能研發院，全面促進AI上游研發、中下游成果轉化及開拓應用場景。在算力基礎方面，現時香港的整體算力已達5 000 PFLOPS，數碼港人工智能超算中心佔3 000 PFLOPS算力，是支持香港AI發展的關鍵要素。另外，位於北區沙嶺的數據園區發展項目將會進一步提升香港整體算力的規模和水準，推動數據及AI相關產業發展，打造香港成爲國際算力樞紐。

此外，特區政府亦一直支持企業擁抱AI所帶來的機遇。我們推出了30億元的人工智能資助計劃，支援本地院校、研發機構和企業充分利用超算中心的算力，到目前為止已經有約20個項目獲批資助。為加強企業支援，數字政策辦公室會在今年內推出「數碼企業身份」，並配備「AI助手」，為企業用戶提供更貼心的政務服務及協助它們降低營運成本。另外，數碼轉型支援先導計劃亦將加入AI及網絡安全數碼方案，鼓勵中小企應用AI提升競爭力。

人工智能正以前所未有的速度改變世界。香港擁有得天獨厚的科研基礎、國際化人才與開放的市場環境，正是推動AI產業化的最佳土壤。生產力局積極協助企業掌握AI技術和提升AI治理水平，不但為企業奠定穩健的應用基礎，也為香港培育具未來視野的數碼人才，推動產業持續升級。我在此感謝生產力局一直以來支持與配合特區政府發展創科的工作。讓我們繼續攜手合作，把握機遇，共同推動香港成為亞洲智慧轉型的領航者。

最後，我祝願「AI with HKPC」智慧AI方案展活動圓滿成功。謝謝大家！"

立法會：勞工及福利局局長就「制訂發展策略，應對人口挑戰」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2026-02-05 10:27,2026-02-05 10:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500244.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（二月五日）在立法會會議就「制訂發展策略，應對人口挑戰」議員議案的開場發言：

主席：

​我感謝陳家珮議員提出的議案，以及黃錦良議員、邱達根議員、吳秋北議員、陳曼琪議員、林琳議員和梁美芬議員提出修正案，讓大家可以集思廣益，探討如何制訂發展策略，應對香港在低生育率、人口高齡化及勞動力漸漸減少等方面的挑戰。

​政府統計處（統計處）每五年都會編製最新的人口推算，釐定推算期內不同時間香港人口的規模，為政府在各方面的規劃工作提供基礎。本港人均壽命延長及出生率持續偏低，加上嬰兒潮出生的一代人陸續步入退休年齡，本港人口持續高齡化。按統計處最新推算，二○四六年年中人口會達到819萬人。撇除外籍家庭傭工，65歲及以上長者屆時將增加至佔人口36%，而勞動人口參與率亦會因而由二○二四年的約55%，逐步下降至二○四六年的52%左右。若本地勞動人口萎縮，很可能會窒礙經濟增長的潛力，而長者人數持續上升，則會增加對各項安老、醫療及其他支援服務的需求。

要應對人口結構轉變帶來的挑戰，政府深切明白須就不同政策範疇作出完善規劃，包括經濟發展、教育培訓、房屋供應、勞工福利、醫療服務、育兒配套等。相關政策局不時檢視各自負責措施的執行情況及成效，並因應社會及人口變化等因素適時作出調整。行政長官、司長和副司長會按需要以工作組和跨部門會議等不同方式提供高層次督導，統籌跨部門的相關工作。例如，就人力資源方面的統籌工作，由政務司司長擔任主席的人力資源規劃委員會為高層次的政策平台，當然委員包括八位政策局局長、政府經濟顧問及政府統計處處長，以及僱員再培訓局、職業訓練局和學術及職業資歷評審局的主席，而非官方委員則包括不同行業和界別的專家和持份者。此外，針對社會高齡化所衍生的挑戰與機遇，政府在二○二四及二○二五年分別成立了由政務司副司長擔任組長的促進銀髮經濟工作組及社會高齡化對策工作組，推動跨局、跨界別協作，制定應對措施。

​勞工及福利局負責人口政策下與發展本地人力資源相關的工作，包括本地勞動力的培訓及再培訓、勞工保障等，以及吸引外來人才及支援他們在港發展。其中，為應對人口高齡化及人力短缺的挑戰，本屆政府自二○二二年底推出一系列積極招攬人才措施，並在人才清單中加入推動「八大中心」相關的產業，清單現時涵蓋共60項專業，有助廣納專才配合經濟高增值及多元化發展。截至今年一月底，相關入境計劃已成功吸引超過26萬世界各地不同界別的人才來到香港工作和發展，當中大部分更處於職涯上的黃金年齡，七成在40歲以下。此外，部分來港人才攜同家眷來港落戶，累計有逾24萬名獲批申請人的受養人抵港，當中包括逾14萬名18歲以下未婚受養子女。這些生力軍扭轉了本地勞動人口在疫情期間的跌勢，有助進一步豐富本地人才庫，提升香港的整體競爭力。與此同時，政府亦繼續投放大量資源培育本地人才及釋放本地勞動力，加強培訓及就業支援服務，協助所有階層及學歷的勞動人口因應香港發展需要持續提升技能和競爭力。其中一個例子是針對人工智能（AI）的迅速發展和普及應用，裝備本地勞動人口掌握相關技能及知識。

今天議案涉及鼓勵生育、打造長者友善環境、釋放銀髮勞動力、推動銀髮經濟持續發展、AI教育與技能培訓等不同政策範疇的措施。我和相關政策局會在仔細聆聽議員意見和建議後作出回應。

多謝主席。"

Latest figures of primary healthcare services provided by Health Bureau to residents affected by Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire,2026-02-05 10:00,2026-02-05 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020400615.htm,"  The Health Bureau (HHB) announced earlier the medical support provided for residents affected by the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. At present, the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts in Hong Kong serve as hubs to co-ordinate various primary healthcare services as needed for the affected residents. The HHB announced today (February 5) the latest figures of these services:

DHC hotlines

  Under the co-ordination of the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission), the DHCs across all 18 districts in Hong Kong have set up hotlines since December 1, 2025, (see Annex 1) to provide personalised case management services for affected residents, offering more convenient and comprehensive medical support. The support includes pairing the affected residents with free consultation services provided by private family doctors and Chinese medicine (CM) practitioners, co-ordinating arrangements for follow-up appointments and medication refills at the Hospital Authority (HA)'s Family Medicine Out-patient (FMOP) Services as necessary, and making referrals to necessary healthcare, nursing and medication services, as well as psychological support. The services co-ordinated by DHCs are not subject to district boundaries. For example, the Centres may assist affected residents in transferring HA FMOP follow up appointments and medication refill service points, from Tai Po District to another location, thereby sparing residents the need for travelling across districts. As of February 3, the DHCs hotlines across all 18 districts have received 386 enquiries in total.

Free consultations by family doctors and CM practitioners and free denture replacement services

  The HHB introduced a free family doctor service scheme, free CM consultation services, and free denture replacement services on December 4, 15, and 23, 2025, respectively to support the primary healthcare needs of the affected residents until February 28 this year. Case managers of the DHCs will arrange for them to receive up to three free consultations by family doctors and CM practitioners respectively based on their individual situations and preferences, covering the provision of medication and related treatments; and at least one free dental consultation and one follow-up appointment (subject to clinical need), covering denture replacement and oral treatment services.

  As of February 3, more than 300 private family doctors have participated in the free family doctor service scheme, covering more than 450 service points that include eight private hospitals. So far, 105 referrals have been handled. As for the free CM consultation services, more than 360 CM practitioners have participated, covering more than 620 service points, and 64 referrals have been handled so far. Regarding free denture replacement services, more than 110 private dentists have participated, covering over 150 service points, and 33 referrals have been handled so far.

HA's healthcare services

  All individuals injured in the fire and admitted to public hospitals under the HA will receive full fee waivers for all necessary healthcare services (including drugs and medical devices) throughout the entire process of their treatment and rehabilitation. A total of 79 patients received treatment at various public hospitals due to the fire. As of February 3, 77 of them had already recovered and were discharged, and the remaining two are in stable condition. Healthcare staff will continue to provide appropriate treatment and care to these patients.

  Moreover, all residents of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers) are eligible for full medical fee waivers until December 31 this year. The waivers cover in-patient services, family medicine and specialist out-patient clinics (SOPCs) services (including psychiatry SOPCs), accident and emergency services, day hospitals, day procedures, community services, and Chinese Medicine Clinics cum Training and Research Centres under the HA. As of February 3, the HA has provided necessary healthcare services to around 2 000 affected residents.

Mental health support

  The 18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline immediately deployed additional staff and strengthened training for its call handlers on the day of the fire incident to cope with the emotional distress that the public may experience due to the incident. From the time of the incident to February 3, the hotline has received around 22 000 calls, about 760 of which were related to the fire incident. The WhatsApp service has handled over 1 000 messages, with about 50 of them concerning the fire incident. The HA's 24-hour Mental Health Direct hotline, manned by psychiatric nurses, offers professional advice and support on mental health issues to callers, including provision of risk assessments and referrals to the HA's mental health services as appropriate. As of February 3, the Mental Health Direct hotline has received 109 calls related to the fire incident, with 47 of them coming from affected citizens.

  The HHB will continue to provide comprehensive primary healthcare support to affected residents. The HHB also designed the relevant service workflow from the residents' perspective, allowing them to receive convenient and effective medical support simply through the DHCs (see Annex 2)."

The month-long festival, running from January 31 to March 1, opened with the outdoor street fair ""Temple Street Night Market"". The street fair, held at the historic Fort Street Mall, Honolulu's first retail centre, was inspired by Hong Kong's Temple Street Night Market. Modelling on its famous namesake, it featured authentic experiences from Temple Street. Over 2 500 spectators enjoyed on-stage festivities including a milk tea demonstration, a Cantopop singing performance and a Wing Chun kung fu demonstration, while also lining up for Cha Chaan Teng delicacies, mahjong tutorials, and feng shui fortune-telling.

The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in San Francisco (HKETO San Francisco) hosted a booth at the night market showcasing some of Hong Kong's intangible cultural heritage items, including Cantonese opera, a lion dance, and techniques for making a cheongsam, Hong Kong-style milk tea, and egg tarts. Visitors learned about the history and culture of these traditions through fact sheets while playing a game to collect thematic souvenirs.

Apart from cultural heritage, diverse aspects of Hong Kong, from picturesque hiking trails to the Kai Tak Sports Park, and from local flavours to home-grown Olympic medalists, were also presented via photographs and information displays.

A series of events will follow, including Hong Kong traditional lifestyle tours in the city's Chinatown, a ""Hong Kong At Your Doorstep"", promotion activity featuring eateries and restaurants offering Hong Kong-style street food, and an industry-focused ""Hong Kong-Greater Bay Area Export Day and Trade Fair"". The festival will conclude with a spring gala marking the 30th anniversary of the Hong Kong Business Association of Hawaii (HKBAH).

CFS continues to follow up powdered infant formula with possible presence of Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus,2026-02-04 23:13,2026-02-04 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400974.htm,"  The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department continues to actively follow up on the precautionary recall of certain batches of powdered infant and young children formula in different areas worldwide due to possible presence of Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus in the individual raw material. The CFS earlier noted through its Food Incident Surveillance System that certain batches of Aptamil powdered infant and young children formula are being recalled by the German authority as the products might contain Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus. The CFS has been very concerned and actively following up on the incident. Following the announcement yesterday (February 3) that a local retailer had sold a small quantity of one affected batch of the powdered infant formula concerned, the CFS's latest follow-up investigation today (February 4) revealed that another trader had imported and distributed the same affected batch of powdered infant formula as announced yesterday.

  Product details are as follows (same product as announced for recall yesterday):

Product name: Aptamil Profutura DUO Pre D 800g
Brand: Aptamil
Pack size: 800 grams
Place of origin: Germany
Use-by date: April 20, 2027
Distributor: HK Wukong Trading Limited
Quantity imported and distributed: 180 cans

  The CFS has found in its follow-up investigation that the above-mentioned distributor had imported and distributed 30 boxes of 180 cans of the affected product. The CFS has instructed the importer, distributor and retailer concerned to stop sales and remove from shelves the affected batch of the product concerned and to initiate a recall. Members of the public may call the distributor's hotline at 6426 1511 during office hours for enquiries about the recall.

  Moreover, the CFS is also actively following up on Nestlé company's recall of a batch of Guigoz Optipro Relais 1 powdered infant formula. The CFS has immediately contacted local importer, Nestlé Hong Kong, and a preliminary investigation revealed that Nestlé Hong Kong has not imported nor sold the affected batch of the Guigoz product concerned. The CFS will continue to closely monitor the progress of the incident. Follow-up actions are ongoing.

   The CFS will continue to enhance surveillance of powdered infant and young children formula and to closely monitor the recall matters and remain fully committed to ensuring food safety. The CFS has alerted the trade and relevant department over the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action.

  Bacillus cereus is commonly found in the environment. Unhygienic conditions in food processing and storage may give rise to its growth. Cereulide is a heat-stable toxin produced in food by some strains of Bacillus cereus. Consuming food contaminated with excessive Bacillus cereus or its heat-stable toxins may cause gastrointestinal upset such as vomiting and diarrhoea.

  The CFS urged members of the public not to let infants and young children consume the affected batch of the product, and to seek medical treatment for infants or young children who felt unwell after taking the product concerned. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately.

  The CFS has established a designated webpage (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/whatsnew/powdered_formula/index.html) to facilitate public access to more information."
食安中心繼續跟進嬰兒配方奶粉可能含有蠟樣芽孢桿菌的耐熱毒素,2026-02-04 22:39,2026-02-04 23:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400949.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（食安中心）繼續積極跟進全球不同地區因個別批次的嬰幼兒配方奶粉可能存在源自微生物蠟樣芽孢桿菌（Bacillus cereus）的物質而作預防性回收的事件。食安中心早前透過食物事故監測系統，得悉德國當局回收個別批次的愛他美（Aptamil）嬰幼兒奶粉產品，因為有關產品可能含有蠟樣芽孢桿菌的耐熱毒素（Cereulide）。食安中心十分關注事件並持續積極跟進， 繼昨日（二月三日）公布有本地零售商曾出售小量的一個受影響批次愛他美（Aptamil）嬰兒配方奶粉，食安中心今日（二月四日）最新跟進調查顯示，另一商戶曾進口及分銷昨日公布的同一受影響批次嬰兒配方奶粉。

產品資料如下（與昨日公布回收的產品相同）：

產品名稱：Aptamil Profutura DUO Pre D 800g
品牌：Aptamil
包裝：八百克
來源地：德國
此日期或之前食用：二○二七年四月二十日
分銷商：香港悟空海淘貿易有限公司
進口及分銷數量：180罐

食安中心跟進調查發現上述分銷商曾進口及分銷30箱共180罐受影響產品。中心已指令有關進口商、分銷商及零售商將涉事批次產品停售和下架，並回收相關產品。市民可於辦公時間致電分銷商的熱線6426 1511查詢上述產品的回收事宜。

此外，食安中心亦積極跟進雀巢公司回收Guigoz品牌1號配方其中一個批次的嬰兒配方奶粉。食安中心已即時聯絡本地進口商雀巢香港，初步調查顯示雀巢香港未有進口及銷售受影響批次的相關Guigoz產品。食安中心會繼續密切監察事件進展，跟進工作仍然繼續。

食安中心會繼續加強在市面抽檢嬰幼兒配方奶粉，並會繼續密切監察相關回收事宜，全力保障食物安全。食安中心已就事件通知業界及相關部門，並會繼續跟進事件和採取適當跟進行動。

The CHP reminded the public to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent foodborne diseases.

The clusters involve two males and four females aged between 29 and 35. They developed diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea and fever about 11 to 37 hours after having dinner at Chef's Cuts located at Shop No. 201, 2/F, Airside, 2 Concorde Road, Kai Tak, Kowloon, on January 30.

One of the affected persons sought medical advice but did not require hospitalisation.All of the affected individuals are currently in stable condition.

A preliminary investigation revealed that raw oyster was the food item that the affected individuals had in common at the aforementioned restaurant. Officers of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (including personnel of the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch) conducted an investigation and examined the handling processes and food hygiene at the restaurant. Food samples were also collected for testing. The CFS's field investigation revealed that the affected persons may have contracted food poisoning from consuming raw food. The CFS immediately instructed the premises concerned to suspend serving the incriminated food items and to carry out cleaning and disinfection of the premises. The officers have also provided health education related to food safety and environmental hygiene to the staff of the premises.

The investigation of the CHP and the CFS is ongoing.

To prevent foodborne diseases, members of the public are reminded to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times. When dining out, one should:


Avoid eating raw seafood;
Be a discerning consumer in choosing cold dishes, including sashimi, sushi and raw oysters at a buffet;
Choose pasteurised eggs, egg products or dried egg powder for dishes that often use undercooked eggs;
Patronise only reliable and licensed restaurants;
Ensure food is thoroughly cooked before eating during a hotpot or barbecue meal;
Handle raw and cooked foods carefully and separate them completely during the cooking process;
Use two sets of chopsticks and utensils to handle raw and cooked foods;
Avoid patronising illegal food hawkers;

Secretary for Health meets with MCHK on amendment to Medical Registration Ordinance,2026-02-04 20:03,2026-02-04 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400755.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, met with members of the Medical Council of Hong Kong (MCHK) today (February 4) to have in-depth exchanges of views on the amendment to the Medical Registration Ordinance.

  As a statutory body established under the Ordinance, the MCHK regulates the medical profession in accordance with the powers conferred by legislation, including handling the registration of medical practitioners, overseeing the Licensing Examination, formulating professional codes and guidelines, and conducting disciplinary inquiries into complaints involving professional misconduct of medical practitioners. Hong Kong's medical profession has long enjoyed an esteemed reputation globally. Maintaining doctors'professional standards forms an important part of the MCHK's work. To ensure that the legislation for healthcare professions keeps pace with the times and meets societal needs and the public interest, the Government needs to review the Ordinance from time to time and propose amendments as necessary, with a view to enabling the MCHK to discharge its statutory functions more effectively, including its function in handling complaints.

  Professor Lo said, ""The MCHK shoulders the statutory duty of maintaining the professional standards of doctors, playing pivotal roles in ensuring doctors'professional conduct, continuously enhancing professional standards, and supporting Hong Kong's development as an international health and medical innovation hub. I am pleased to note the continual adjustments and enhancement of the MCHK's work in response to new trends in healthcare development in recent years. These include issuing ethical guidelines on the provision of services to patients through telemedicine by doctors to meet societal needs, and fully supporting the Government's policy to admit non-locally trained doctors by establishing the Special Registration Committee to assess medical qualifications from different places. To date, a total of 150 medical qualifications from different places have been recognised.

  ""The MCHK upholds the mission of ensuring justice, maintaining professionalism and protecting the public. Vested with independent quasi-judicial functions and powers to impose disciplinary sanctions through disciplinary proceedings on doctors whose professional standards or ethical conduct fall short of the required standards, the MCHK has a statutory responsibility and the powers to protect patients' interests. The intent behind this legislative amendment to the Ordinance is to enhance the efficiency of the MCHK's complaint handling, while maintaining professionalism and fairness, and to enhance doctors' professional standards. I am grateful to members of the MCHK for offering their valuable advice on further enhancing transparency and accountability in the work of the MCHK by drawing on their own experience participating in the work of the MCHK. The Government will consider the views received holistically in finalising the legislative proposal, including clarifying various implementation details.""

  The Health Bureau (HHB) noted that the MCHK recognised that handling complaints against doctors was crucial to safeguarding professional standards, and had been striving to address bottlenecks in the complaint handling process in recent years. Under the leadership of its Chairman, Professor Grace Tang, the MCHK has implemented measures since end-2024 to improve efficiency in handling complaints. These measures include taking stock of all cases pending inquiry, prioritising and expediting their handling, and co-ordinating with legal representatives and expert witnesses for better support; enhancing the complaint handling information system; and strengthening the Secretariat's monitoring of case progress to closely track the time taken at various stages of the process.

  In response to public concern last year about the MCHK's investigation and disciplinary inquiry mechanism for handling complaints, the MCHK has reviewed the mechanism earlier at the request of the Secretary for Health and submitted a report to the HHB on improving the mechanism's operation to safeguard doctors'professional standards. Meanwhile, to ensure continuous enhancement of healthcare professional standards in support of Hong Kong's determination to develop into an international health and medical innovation hub, the HHB announced earlier to amend the Ordinance, having regard to the report's recommendations and the operational needs of the MCHK, targeting to introduce a bill to the Legislative Council (LegCo) in the first half of this year.

  In January this year, the HHB consulted patient groups, the two local medical schools, the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, the Hong Kong Medical Association and various medical professional associations on the amendment to the Ordinance. The HHB will brief the Panel on Health Services of the LegCo shortly on the proposed directions and enhancement proposals for the Ordinance."
CHP investigates case of invasive meningococcal infection,2026-02-04 19:32,2026-02-04 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400766.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (February 4) is investigating a case of invasive meningococcal infection, and reminds the public to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times to minimise the risk of contracting this serious disease.

  The case involves a 64-year-old male with underlying illnesses. He presented with redness, swelling and pain over both his calves on January 26 and developed a fever on the following day. He attended a private hospital on the same day and was admitted for treatment. His blood specimen tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was meningococcaemia.He is now in a stable condition.

  An initial investigation revealed that the patient had no travel history during the incubation period. His household contact has remained asymptomatic so far and has been prescribed preventive drugs. The CHP's investigation is ongoing.

  Meningococcal infection is a statutory notifiable disease. The CHP has recorded one case this year so far. A total of 11 cases were recorded last year.

  Meningococcal infection is caused by a bacterium known as meningococcus. It is mainly transmitted by direct contact with respiratory secretions, including droplets from the nose and throat, of infected persons. Severe illness may result when the bacteria invade the bloodstream (meningococcaemia) or the membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord (meningococcal meningitis). Meningococcaemia is characterised by a sudden onset of fever, an intense headache, purpura, shock and even death in severe cases. Meningococcal meningitis is characterised by high fever, severe headache, stiff neck followed by drowsiness, vomiting, fear of bright light, or rash; it can cause brain damage or even death.

  To prevent meningococcal infection, members of the public are advised to take the following measures:


Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly, especially when they are soiled by respiratory secretions, e.g. after sneezing, and clean hands with alcohol-based handrub when they are not visibly soiled;
Cover the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing, hold the saliva with a tissue, dispose of nasal and mouth discharge in a lidded rubbish bin, and wash hands immediately;
Avoid crowded places;
Avoid close contact with patients who have a fever or severe headache;
Consult doctors about meningococcal vaccination before travelling to high-risk areas; and
Seek medical advice if you become ill after returning from high-risk areas, and discuss your recent travel history with your doctor.

個案涉及一名有長期病患的64歲男子，他於一月二十六日發現雙腿小腿位置出現皮膚紅腫及疼痛，翌日發燒，同日到私家醫院求診，需留院治療。他的血液樣本經化驗後，證實對腦膜炎雙球菌呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為腦膜炎雙球菌血症。病人現時情況穩定。

初步調查顯示，病人潛伏期內沒有外遊，他的家居接觸者至今沒有出現病徵，並已獲發預防性藥物。中心的調查仍然進行中。

侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染是法定須呈報傳染病。中心今年至今錄得一宗個案，而去年全年共錄得11宗個案。

腦膜炎雙球菌感染是由腦膜炎雙球菌所引起，主要經由直接接觸帶菌者的呼吸道分泌物（包括口鼻分泌物）而傳播。當細菌入侵血液（腦膜炎雙球菌血症）或包圍腦部及脊髓的內膜（流行性腦膜炎）時，可引致嚴重病症。腦膜炎雙球菌血症的病徵包括突發性發燒、劇烈頭痛、皮膚出現瘀斑及休克，嚴重者甚至會致命。流行性腦膜炎的病徵包括發高燒、劇烈頭痛、頸部僵硬及嗜睡，亦會有嘔吐、畏光或皮疹等情況出現，若情況嚴重更可造成腦部損害或死亡。

中心呼籲市民採取以下預防措施以預防腦膜炎雙球菌感染：


用梘液和清水正確洗手，尤其在雙手被呼吸道分泌物污染時，如打噴嚏後。當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，可用酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時應掩着口鼻，用紙巾包裹痰涎，棄置於有蓋的垃圾桶內，並即時洗手；
避免到人多擠迫的地方；
避免與出現發燒或劇烈頭痛病徵的病人作親密接觸；
前往高危地區前，應諮詢醫生有關接種腦膜炎雙球菌疫苗的詳情；及
從高危地區返港後若感到不適，應立即求診，並告知醫生近期曾到訪的地區。


市民可參閱衞生防護中心網頁以取得更多有關腦膜炎雙球菌感染的資料。"

乙巳蛇年蜿蜒而去，香港在邁向由治及興的征程上穩步前行。二○二五年，香港經濟達到百分之3.5的按年增長，貨品出口和進口總額分別大增百分之12。這一年，香港繼續成為全球最自由經濟體，世界競爭力上升至全球第三，人才排名和數碼競爭力都升至全球第四，內地和海外企業的駐港公司達到超過11 000家的歷史新高。

這些成就，都是來自國家堅實支持、特區政府不懈努力、香港市民團結奮鬥，彰顯香港在「一國兩制」下內聯外通的優勢。

丙午馬年奔騰而至，香港社會經濟將煥發新活力、展現新韌性。在馬年，特區政府將與社會各界一道，主動對接國家發展戰略，深化國際交往合作，奮力譜寫「一國兩制」行穩致遠的壯麗篇章。在這裏，我向各位談談香港在馬年發展的四個方向。

第一，爭當先驅，主動融入和服務國家發展大局。今年是國家「十五五」規劃的開局之年，我將領導整個特區政府不同政策局和部門，主動對接「十五五」規劃框架，並首次制定香港的五年規劃。特區政府會強化擔當意識，切實履行第一責任人的角色，積極帶領社會各界主動對接「十五五」規劃。我們將深化與粵港澳大灣區城市的全方位合作，強化規則銜接、機制對接，助力打造世界級的一流灣區。

第二，奮力騰躍，積極打造經濟發展的「千里馬」。特區政府將鞏固提升香港國際金融、航運、貿易中心地位，全力建設國際創新科技中心和國際高端人才集聚高地。香港正加速建立國際黃金交易市場，同時推動更多高增值產業落戶北部都會區。面對地緣政治陰晴不定，全球各地都尋求安全可靠的經貿夥伴和投資機會。香港會不遠千里，奔馳四海，鞏固與傳統經濟體的聯繫，同時加強與新興經濟體的交往。特區政府已成立內地企業出海專班，對接內地蓬勃發展的生產力、香港國際知名的專業服務、環球買家的殷切需求，攜手優質企業「走出去」、把國際資金「引進來」，扎實推動經濟高質量發展。

第三，蹄疾步穩，持續提升廣大市民的民生福祉。發展的最終目的，是為了讓市民過上更美好的生活。新的一年，《僱傭條例》下「連續性合約」新規定已生效，香港中醫醫院投入服務，「簡約公屋」將有8 000個單位在第二季開始入住，首個按「一年一檢」制定的法定最低工資將在五月實施。我們將以更大力度幫助市民安居樂業，加強對長者、殘疾人士、弱勢社群等的支援，並為青年的向上流動搭建更廣闊的舞台。

第四，一馬當先，堅持和完善行政主導，提升管治效能。「一國兩制」下的行政主導體制，是香港繁榮穩定的基石之一。新的一年，我會帶領管治團隊進一步履行行政主導，促進行政立法良性互動、既互相制衡、又互相配合，讓特區領轡前行，把行政主導融入治理不同的環節，進一步深化改革，把高效市場和有為政府更好結合起來，為香港拼經濟、謀發展、搞建設、惠民生。

靈蛇辭歲，天地煥新，萬馬奔騰，繁華似錦。各位，馬年的新征程快將展開，香港的發展將開創新未來。特區政府將繼續發揮香港在「一國兩制」下擁有國家機遇和國際機遇的雙重疊加優勢，推動香港迎風馳騁，駿業宏開。

我祝願國家民和年豐、一馬當先，香港百業興旺、馬到功成。謝謝大家。"

LCQ1: Soliciting business and attracting investment by exhibiting plans of major development projects,2026-02-04 18:50,2026-02-04 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400723.htm,"​Following is a question by the Hon Erik Yim and a reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

The Development Bureau had planned to build ""a gallery to showcase major development projects"" in Wan Chai to exhibit and present major projects, including Northern Metropolis (NM), but the Government subsequently decided to set up physical exhibitions in the community liaison centres of various new development areas and establish an online exhibition on a website instead. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given the view that the dispersed provision of exhibitions on the NM causes a waste of resources and fails to achieve an economy-of-scale effect, hence the difficulty in soliciting business and attracting investment for the NM, whether the Government will consider concentrating the gallery sites in the NM region; if not, of the reasons for that;

(2) whether it will consider appropriately expanding the scale of Innohub and designating a dedicated zone to display the development blueprint of the NM, so as to reduce duplication of resources allocation and attract public attention in a more focused manner; and

(3) whether it will draw on the Mainland's successful experiences in gallery planning (such as those of Pudong in Shanghai, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Qianhai in Shenzhen) to display the development outcomes of major projects visually and dynamically by integrating non-costly technologies such as AI-driven virtual reality, holographic projection, 3D multimedia, and interactive sand table to create panoramic immersive experiences, thereby enhancing the effectiveness in soliciting business and attracting investment?

Reply:

President,
  
The Northern Metropolis (NM) is a key engine for Hong Kong's future economic development. With the fundamental planning now in place and land supply progressively being made available, the development of the NM has entered a new stage. One of the major tasks is to facilitate enterprises to participate in construction and to promote industry anchoring. At the same time, it is essential to foster social consensus to drive the development of the NM.

My reply to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Erik Yim is as follows:

(1) and (2) The establishment of exhibition galleries relating to the NM would help achieve two major objectives. First, it aims to facilitate community understanding and support for the NM as Hong Kong's strategic growth area. Second, it seeks to attract enterprises and investment by showcasing the potential of the NM, thereby encouraging enterprises to participate in construction, attracting enterprises to establish footholds and fostering industry clustering.

Following an earlier preliminary exploration, we had once proposed the construction of an exhibition gallery on a site at the Wan Chai North harbourfront to showcase major infrastructure projects, including the NM. Having listened to views from the community and the Legislative Council and taking into account the priorities of work and resource allocation, we consider that this is not the appropriate time to pursue the project. In fact, the implementation of such a project would require a relatively long lead time, which cannot meet the pressing need to attract enterprises and investment to the NM.

If the purpose is to only introduce the NM to the general public, the Government has in recent years set up a dedicated NM exhibition zone at the City Gallery in Central. For the objective of attracting enterprises and investment, our experience shows that enterprises interested in exploring participation in the development of the NM often wish to gain close-up understanding of its latest progress and conduct on-site visits. At present, the Government has established Community Liaison Centres (CLCs) in several new development areas (NDAs) in the NM, including Kwu Tung North, Fanling North, Hung Shui Kiu and the Loop. The CLCs for Fanling North and the Loop, commissioned in 2023 and 2024 respectively, have incorporated exhibition facilities showcasing the planning and works of the relevant NDAs and have become the first two ""district exhibition centres"" of the NM. The exhibition content of the Fanling North CLC even covers the overall planning and development of the NM. Following this direction, the Hung Shui Kiu CLC, which is scheduled to have completed relocation and expansion around the first quarter of this year, will also include exhibition facilities introducing the Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen NDA as well as the overall planning and development of the NM. Experience shows that these ""district exhibition centres"" can more effectively complement the on-site visits, showcasing the concrete development achievements of the respective areas to visitors, thereby better focusing on the current work of attracting enterprises and investment.

Looking ahead, we will consider expanding the exhibition content of the Innohub at the Loop to cover the development of the adjacent San Tin Technopole, Ma Tso Lung and even the entire NM. In addition, we plan to establish a larger and multi-purpose core exhibition gallery for the NM in the Kwu Tung North NDA, with the first phase targeted for commissioning in 2027. This will replace the existing CLC in Kwu Tung North, which is of a smaller scale. The new NM core exhibition gallery will be located in Kwu Tung North given its proximity to the East Rail Line Kwu Tung Station scheduled to commission in 2027, offering convenient transport access. The site is also close to the museum to showcase national development and achievements, which has already been designated by the Government to be located in Kwu Tung North, allowing for the future development of an exhibition cluster. Moreover, the Long Valley Nature Park is nearby, enabling visitors to the exhibition gallery to also tour the park and appreciate the NM's vision and achievements of ""co-existence of development and conservation"".

In addition to the abovementioned physical exhibition galleries, we will also establish an online exhibition platform on the dedicated NM website, making use of multimedia to introduce the NM to viewers within and outside Hong Kong.

(3) We agree that in order to attract visitors and enhance the effectiveness of attracting enterprises and investment, it is not only important to provide rich exhibition content, but also to place emphasis on curatorial approaches. In this regard, we will continue to draw reference from the exhibition galleries in the Mainland and other places, planning from the perspective of visitors and adopting multimedia and technology-based presentation methods. For example, the Fanling North CLC is equipped with holographic projection and three-dimensional models to present the overall picture of the NDA in a tangible manner. It also offers immersive experiences through image projection to create virtual reality, enabling participants to experience a ""flyover"" of the Fanling North NDA. In addition, there are simulated driving games, allowing visitors to learn about and experience the development of the relevant NDA and the NM as a whole through diverse formats.

The future core exhibition gallery of the NM in Kwu Tung North under planning will adopt more innovative technologies to create a panoramic interactive platform. Through multimedia presentations and multi-perspective displays, the exhibition gallery will highlight the NM as Hong Kong's new engine of future development, enabling the public to gain a more direct understanding of the planning blueprint and allowing investors to acquire a more concrete appreciation of the NM's development potential."
立法會︰發展局副局長就「進一步提速提效建設好北部都會區，推動香港創科產業更好落地發展」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2026-02-04 18:48,2026-02-04 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400728.htm,"以下是發展局副局長林智文今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上就「進一步提速提效建設好北部都會區，推動香港創科產業更好落地發展」議員議案的總結發言全文：

主席：

我再次感謝陳勇議員提出議案，以及其他數位議員提出的動議修正案，亦很感謝各位議員剛才提出的寶貴意見和建議，對於我們往後繼續推進北都（北部都會區）發展十分重要。

在此，我想就剛才提及的數個範疇作個扼要回應，並與各位分享一些資訊及最新情況。剛才大家都提出要盡快發展北都，隨着北都的基本規劃已出台，現在是北都關鍵的起動期，造地方面，我們全速前進，特別是產業用地。我們預計到二○二五／二六年度終，可以平整約120公頃用地。大家看看未來五年以至十年，其實這個產出會更加節節上升，二○二六／二七至二○三○／三一年間，我們可以產出另外約900公頃用地，落成約70000個公私營住宅單位，以及約100萬平方米的經濟樓面面積；如果我們再看五年至二○三五／三六年度底，將累計產出1800公頃發展用地，落成約24萬個房屋單位及逾1000萬平方米的經濟樓面面積供應市場。

北都涉及的議題及政策範疇其實相當廣闊。發展局會繼續聯同其他政策局全力推展北都，加快建設和引進產業，其中一個重點工作就是為北都發展制定專屬法例。剛才很多議員都就這法例的重要性及一些內容提出意見。由於北都專屬法例橫跨多個政策範疇，例如剛才議員提到如何管理一些特定要素，包括人流、物流和數據流的跨境流通，發展局現正統籌相關籌備工作，爭取盡快向立法會提交條例草案並在年內完成立法工作。在開始發言時，我提到發展局會在今季就草案條例作諮詢，我們很期望屆時立法會各位議員可以積極向我們提供寶貴意見，幫助我們更好完善法例草案，促進創科以至整個北都不同區塊的發展。

在剛才的發言當中，亦有很多議員就發展大學城的重要性及其定位提出意見。其實自政府提出發展北都大學城以來，已經將其規模由最初提出約60公頃，增加至現時超過100公頃，這些用地分布在牛潭尾新發展區（約52公頃）、新界北新市鎮（約40公頃）及洪水橋／厦村新發展區（約9公頃）。政府亦會因應需要考慮把洪水橋的北都大學城部分進一步擴容。這些大學城的用地最早面世的一批會在洪水橋／厦村新發展區，我們預計第一批可於二○二六年完成土地平整。關於發展定位方面，政務司司長擔任組長的「大學城籌劃及建設組」會研究北都大學城發展模式，以及如何以產業為導向，為三個新發展區已預留作大學或高等教育用地的發展願景和定位作出建議。

北都助力香港融入及貢獻國家發展大局，以及大灣區高質量發展，我們非常重視與廣東省的對接協調工作。特區政府會繼續通過由財政司副司長與深圳市常務副市長共同主持的「對接北部都會區發展策略專班」，就北都的發展作緊密溝通，做好粵港對接，共同磋商跨境發展建設事宜。

很多議員提出我們需要招商引資，發展局會繼續與投資推廣署及引進重點企業辦公室攜手合作，共同推廣北都，吸引高增值產業和高潛力企業落戶香港，亦會持續接觸各界人士包括不同海內外企業，介紹北都計劃和最新發展。

當然，除了企業，亦會向不同持份者，包括香港的年輕人，推廣北都。所以，我們設有北都專屬網站，另外在一些新發展區的社區聯絡中心，我們會陸續加入展覽場地，亦會設立一個專屬網上展覽廳，希望令我們的接觸面更廣闊。

剛才很多議員都提出政府需要以創新思維，拆牆鬆綁，便利企業進駐，所以政府會更主動，透過各式多元開發模式，加快北都發展。當中除既有的原址換地安排外，亦會創新利用「片區開發」模式、剛才有議員提及的分階段開發模式、對產業進行靈活批撥土地、成立產業園公司等。我們希望這些創新發展模式，配合靈活的地價繳付安排，例如分期繳付地價、主動交回將收回的私人土地以藉此抵銷地價或按實補價的安排，提高市場投資及參與意欲。

另外，關於拆牆鬆綁，為了加強對北都大型私人發展項目審批的統籌與監督，做到拆牆鬆綁，政府已在由財政司副司長擔任組長的「規劃及發展工作組」之下，成立北都專案監督辦公室，由發展局常任秘書長（規劃及地政）領導，設有時限和分階段通報機制，以加快審批速度，加速企業進駐。

北都的工作充滿挑戰，但我們一定會全力以赴，將北都發展提速提效，讓市民早日受惠，亦令香港可以因應北都的發展，更好發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，服務國家發展大局。

我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"
立法會：創新科技及工業局局長就「進一步提速提效建設好北部都會區，推動香港創科產業更好落地發展」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2026-02-04 18:45,2026-02-04 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400714.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（二月四日）在立法會會議就「進一步提速提效建設好北部都會區，推動香港創科產業更好落地發展」議員議案的總結發言：

主席：

我再次感謝陳勇議員提出的動議辯論，以及提出修正案的議員。我也要感謝另外34位議員的積極發言，就推進北部都會區與河套深港科技創新合作區的建設，以至香港的產業發展提出了不少真知灼見。剛才，發展局副局長回應了有關北部都會區規劃的意見。我現在就各位議員有關創科發展的意見，作出綜合回應。

河套香港園區

我在開場發言時指出，河套合作區由香港園區及深圳園區以「一河兩岸」、「一區兩園」的理念共同構建而成。河套香港園區會按照「自由開放、連通內外、便利流動」的基本原則發展，充分發揮香港作為連通內地與世界的橋樑角色及優勢，匯聚海內外創科資源及人才，成為招商引資、招才引智的重要平台，推動大灣區國際科技創新中心建設。

河套香港園區於去年十二月正式開園。兩座投入服務的濕實驗室大樓已有超過60家來自本地和海內外的科技企業及機構簽署入駐，佔兩座大樓樓面面積的八成。它們主要從事人工智能和數據科學、生命健康科學，以及微電子、新能源和機器人技術等前沿科技領域。

落戶的企業主要是看中園區的區位優勢。香港的獨特優勢既有助內地企業「走出去」，也便利海外企業以香港為跳板進入內地市場。我們會以「邊建設、邊進駐」模式，因應市場需求，靈活為企業提供工作空間，讓它們提早進駐，而無須等待整個園區工程完成。

另外，為支援落戶企業的業務發展，園區公司也會提供包括商業配對、投資對接、專業顧問服務（比如知識產權、稅務、金融投資、會計、法律、檢測標準認證等多項專業服務），助力落戶園區的企業提升自身技術能力和市場競爭力。此外，園區還將提供專門空間和財政資源支持初創企業的發展。

為加快香港園區的建設工作，園區公司已選定第一期用地特定地塊並徵求了市場發展意向，我們將於今年稍後時間盡快將土地推出市場，以期透過市場力量提速、提效推進香港園區發展。

與此同時，園區第二期用地的發展規劃布局已完成，兩期發展提供的總樓面面積可達200萬平方米，較原計劃增加約七成。園區將按功能劃分科技區塊，包括生命健康科技、人工智能與數據科學、新科技與先進製造等支柱產業，促進產業的上、中、下游協同發展，打造完整創科產業鏈。

除了加快工程，促進創新要素跨園區流動的便利措施是河套合作區的獨特優勢。特區政府正積極與深圳市政府和相關部委積極研究具體實施細節，爭取在符合國家安全相關法律法規及風險可控的前提下，盡早試行內地數據和生物樣本流動到香港園區作科研用途，用好河套香港園區作為「國內境外」的地區及合作區「一區兩園」的獨特優勢。

按照現時的商討，跨園區的流動會以如「綠色通道」、參與企業「白名單」、數據及物流清單等機制，簡化進出兩地園區的出入手續和審批程序，以及以科技和信息化手段，就取樣、運輸、出入庫、使用、銷毀等環節全程監控的方式實施。人員流動方面，連接港深兩個園區的西面跨河連接橋項目已於去年十二月正式啓動，將有效促進跨境人員流動。為了便利兩地創科人員往來，兩地政府會積極研究使用創新的出入境清關模式，目標是可以讓預先核實資格的人員使用人臉識別技術核實身分，從而達致「無感通關」。

新田科技城

如果說河套園區將主要聚焦於研發及中試，新田科技城則更聚焦於產業發展，將會成為香港未來的產業發展重鎮。作為河套地區的天然延伸，新田科技城具有三大優勢，它毗鄰香港園區，北面與福田和皇崗的創科生態緊密對接，南面連接牛潭尾北都大學城，具有區位優勢。作為河套的天然延伸，新田科技城提供成片新創科土地，可滿足不同產業鏈環節、不同規模企業、不同科技領域的空間需求，具有規模優勢。此外，它享有優越的交通網絡，鄰近深圳，也鄰近三寶樹濕地保育公園，具有優良生態環境和宜居的優勢。通過聚焦產業、人才和空間之間的互動，打造以產優城、以城引人、以人築產的良性循環。

產業發展方面，新田科技城可提供較大規模土地，支援《香港創新科技發展藍圖》所提出的策略性創科產業發展，也就是生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人、微電子與智能裝備、新材料、新能源及綠色科技等，並聚焦以先進製造為核心的香港創科產業體系的建設。

新田科技城創科用地會以三個樞紐、三個產業發展帶（三紐、三帶）發展，也就是由北至南，由河套樞紐、洲頭樞紐及麒麟樞紐，以及生命健康科技發展帶、人工智能與機械人發展帶及微電子與先進產業發展帶。因應相關收地和工務部門土地平整工程時間表，將劃分五個發展階段，從導入、產業生態延展、產城中樞，以至完善階段。規劃上也會結合實際情況，並預留一定發展彈性，比如在南面麒麟樞紐附近，我們會提供戰略留白區域。

新田一帶的新創科用地與河套香港園區將形成上中下游協同發展的重要紐帶，為創科產業提供辦公、原型、小試、中試、生產綜合空間的全鏈條配套支持。政府會按照《新田科技城創科產業發展規劃概念綱要》全力推動有關發展，包括考慮以成立專屬公司的模式與市場共同參與開發，利用市場化資源提升開發速度、優化開發成本。政府將按土地的供應時間表，適時提出階段性發展方案。

其他配套措施扶助產業發展

多位議員都關心構建創科生態圈以至促進新型工業化的發展。政府自二○二三年起已扶植超過500家具潛力或引領性的創科企業在港發展、落戶或擴展在港業務，涵蓋生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人，以及先進製造等。我們將繼續改革求變，在更廣闊的範圍内，協助業界解決發展新型工業化的關鍵痛點，完善創科產業發展環境。

在支援初創企業及匯聚創科人才方面，創新科技署已成功推行創科人才庫計劃多年，有效支援、匯聚了一大批優秀的年輕創科專才。我們已經推出了1.8億元「創科加速器先導計劃」，吸引專業服務機構在港建立加速器基地，支援初創企業。另外，我們已經於去年九月推出30億元「前沿科技研究支援計劃」，吸引國際頂尖科技人才來港發展。

結語

主席，我再次感謝每位發言的議員。河套香港園區和新田科技城肩負推動香港以至大灣區科技發展的重要使命，是支持香港未來創科發展的重要載體，為推動香港的高質量發展帶來重要機遇。我們將進一步強化「產、學、研、投」的高效合作，堅決落實夏寶龍主任關於行政主導的指導方針，抓住機遇，深化改革，拆牆鬆綁。我希望在河套、沙嶺等邊境區域能進一步放寬限制，充分利用好國家資源，先行先試，「多、快、好、省」地構建蓬勃的創科生態圈，打造香港經濟的新增長點，助力香港發展新質生產力。

主席，本人謹此陳辭。"
