政府張貼收回土地公告以收回興建北環線主線所需的私人土地,2025-07-31 15:40,2025-07-31 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100407.htm,"地政總署今日（七月三十一日）根據《鐵路條例》（第519章）第19條張貼收回土地公告，以收回興建北環線主線所需的私人土地。獲批准的北環線主線的鐵路方案涉及一條長約10.7公里的地下鐵路，連接現有屯馬線錦上路站與東鐵線上正在興建的古洞站，並於凹頭、牛潭尾和新田設三個中途站。

政府將收回686幅涉及面積約26公頃的私人土地及252幅涉及面積約8.6公頃的私人土地地層。上述土地將於收回土地公告張貼後三個月（即二○二五年十一月一日）復歸政府所有。政府會在土地復歸政府後，向相關土地業權人發放特惠土地補償及處理相關法定補償申索。

土地復歸日期是指土地業權轉歸政府的日期，並非受影響住戶及業務經營者須遷出的限期。按照工程時間表，在受影響住戶和業務經營者遷出限期前三個月，地政總署會另行按照適用程序在相關範圍張貼公告，現時預計受影響的住戶和業務經營者最早須由二○二六年年初開始遷出。政府會與相關土地業權人和受影響人士保持緊密溝通，妥善處理他們的補償和安置事宜。

政府早前與香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵公司）簽訂北環線項目（包括北環線主線和支線）的第一部分項目協議，啓動北環線主線項目當中較成熟和較迫切的工程，並同時要求港鐵公司同步進行北環線支線的詳細規劃及設計，包括相關法定程序。北環線主線將成為北部都會區多個新發展區的公共運輸骨幹，並會連接現有的屯馬線及東鐵線，形成貫通新界和九龍市區的環狀鐵路，大大提升鐵路網絡的覆蓋範圍和韌性，同時釋放北部都會區的發展潛力。北環線支線則會作為北環線項目的跨境分支，連通香港和深圳的地鐵網絡，同時兼備香港本地通勤和跨境鐵路服務的功能。"
Government posts land resumption notices for resumption of private lots required for construction of Northern Link Main Line,2025-07-31 15:40,2025-07-31 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100412.htm,"The Lands Department today (July 31) posted land resumption notices in accordance with section 19 of the Railways Ordinance (Chapter 519) to resume private lots required for the construction of the Northern Link (NOL) Main Line. The authorised railway scheme of the NOL Main Line involves a 10.7-kilometre underground railway connecting the existing Kam Sheung Road Station of the Tuen Ma Line and the Kwu Tung Station under construction on the East Rail Line, with three intermediate stations at Au Tau, Ngau Tam Mei and San Tin.

  In all, 686 private lots with a total area of about 26 hectares as well as an underground strata of 252 private lots with a total area of about 8.6 hectares will be resumed by the Government. The said land will revert to the Government upon the expiry of a period of three months from the date of affixing the land resumption notices (i.e. November 1, 2025). The Government will release ex-gratia land compensation to the relevant land owners and handle relevant statutory claims for compensation after the land reversion.

The land reversion date is the date of vesting of the ownership of the land in the Government. It is not the departure deadline of the affected households and business undertakings. According to the project programme, the Lands Department will post notices in relevant areas in accordance with the applicable procedures about three months before the departure deadlines of the affected households and business undertakings. It is estimated that the affected households and business undertakings will have to move out starting from early 2026 at the earliest. The Government will closely liaise with the relevant land owners and affected parties, and properly handle their compensation and rehousing matters.

The Government has earlier executed the Part1 Project Agreement of the NOL Project (comprising both the NOL Main Line and the NOL Spur Line) with the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) to commence works on the NOL Main Line that are more ready and time-critical, and also required the MTRCL to carry out the detailed planning and design of the NOL Spur Line including relevant statutory procedures in parallel. The NOL Main Line would become the public transportation backbone for multiple new development areas in the Northern Metropolis and connect the existing Tuen Ma Line and East Rail Line, forming a railway loop linking the New Territories and the Kowloon urban area. This will substantially enhance the coverage and resilience of the railway network and also unleash the development potential of the Northern Metropolis. The NOL Spur Line, as a cross-boundary bifurcation of the NOL Project, would connect the metro networks of Hong Kong and Shenzhen, offering both local commuting functions within Hong Kong as well as cross-boundary railway services."

CFS announces test results of targeted surveillance on nutrition labelling of prepackaged sauce,2025-07-31 15:00,2025-07-31 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100388.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (July 31) released the test results of a targeted food surveillance project on the nutrition labelling of prepackaged sauce. Among 40 samples tested, including food items purchased online, one sample was found with protein content inconsistent with the declared value on its nutrition label, while the remaining 39 samples passed the test.

""The CFS collected samples from different retail outlets for the targeted food surveillance project. Tests were conducted to check if the energy content and specified nutrient content (total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, sugars, sodium, protein, carbohydrates, and more) are consistent with the declared values on their nutrition labels. The food labels were also checked to see if they comply with relevant requirements under the laws,"" a spokesman for the CFS said.

The CFS has announced the irregularity in the actual nutrient content earlier. The vendor concerned has also stopped selling the relevant batches of the affected product. Prosecution will be instituted should there be sufficient evidence.

The Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) Regulations (Cap. 132W) require all applicable prepackaged foods to list the ingredients and the content of energy plus seven core nutrients, namely carbohydrates, protein, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, sodium and sugars, and regulate any associated nutrition claims.

Nutrition labelling can assist consumers in making informed food choices, encourage food manufacturers to apply sound nutrition principles in the formulation of foods, and regulate misleading or deceptive labels and claims. According to Section 61 of the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132), if any person falsely describes food or misleads as to the nature, substance or quality of the food on a label of the food sold by him or her, he or she shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and six months' imprisonment upon conviction.

The CFS will continue to conduct surveillance on other food samples to check if their energy content and specified nutrient content are consistent with the declared values on their nutrition labels, and the results will be released in due course. The spokesman reminded the food trade to comply with the law, and urged members of the public to pay attention to the information on nutrition labels when purchasing food to make informed food choices to achieve a balanced diet and stay healthy."
CFS announces food safety report for June,2025-07-31 15:00,2025-07-31 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100198.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (July 31) released the findings of its food safety report for last month. The results of about 6 700 food samples tested (including food items purchased online) were found to be satisfactory except for eight unsatisfactory samples that were announced earlier. The overall satisfactory rate was 99.9 per cent.

A CFS spokesman said that about 2 100 food samples were collected for microbiological tests, and about 4 600 samples were taken for chemical and radiation level tests.

The microbiological tests covered pathogens and hygiene indicators; the chemical tests included testing for pesticides, preservatives, metallic contaminants, colouring matters, veterinary drug residues and others; and the radiation-level tests included testing for radioactive caesium and iodine in samples collected from imported food from different regions.

The samples comprised about 1 800 samples of vegetables and fruit and their products; about 500 samples of cereals, grains and their products; about 700 samples of meat and poultry and their products; about 1 100 samples of milk, milk products and frozen confections; about 1 100 samples of aquatic and related products; and about 1 500 samples of other food commodities (including beverages, bakery products and snacks).

The eight unsatisfactory samples comprised a prepackaged frozen giant scarlet shrimp sample detected with a metallic contaminant exceeding the legal limit, a prepackaged black pepper sample found to contain a pesticide, ethylene oxide, a Chinese lettuce sample and a banana sample detected with pesticide residues exceeding the legal limits, two ice cream samples detected with coliform bacteria counts exceeding the legal limits, a soft ice-cream sample detected with a total bacterial count exceeding the legal limit, and a frozen confection sample detected with coliform bacteria and total bacterial counts exceeding the legal limits.

The CFS has taken follow-up actions on the above-mentioned unsatisfactory samples, including informing the vendors concerned of the test results, instructing them to stop selling the affected food items, and tracing the sources of the food items in question.

The spokesman reminded the food trade to ensure that food is fit for human consumption and meets legal requirements. Consumers should patronise reliable shops when buying food and maintain a balanced diet to minimise food risks.

Separately, in response to the Japanese Government's discharge of nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the CFS will continue enhancing the testing on imported Japanese food, and make reference to the risk assessment results to adjust relevant surveillance work in a timely manner. The CFS will announce every working day on its dedicated webpage (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/daily_japan_nuclear_incidents.html) the radiological test results of the samples of food imported from Japan, with a view to enabling the trade and members of the public to have a better grasp of the latest safety information."

Speech by DCS at BOC Life 10th Golden Age Expo and Summit Grand Opening (English only)(with photos),2025-07-31 14:15,2025-07-31 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100455.htm,"Following is the speech by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing,at the BOC Life 10th Golden Age Expo and Summit Grand Opening this morning (July 31):

Dr Yasuko Arase (Deputy Mayor, Fukuoka City, Japan),Dr Roy Chung (Honorary President, Golden Age Foundation, Founder and Chairman, Bright Future Charitable Foundation), Mr Wilson Tang (Chief Executive Officer, BOC Group Life Assurance Company Limited),Dr Donald Li (Chairman of Elderly Commission), Professor Rebecca Choy Yung (Founder and Chair of Golden Age Foundation), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you today at the grand opening of the 10th Golden Age Expo and Summit.

I would like to thank the Golden Age Foundation for your meaningful contribution to our community. Over the past decade, this flagship event has established itself as a vital platform for fostering collaboration between the public and private sectors. I learned that the last edition in 2024 saw a record-breaking attendance of over 40 000 from around the globe. Such enthusiastic participation is strong evidence of the enormous potential of silver economy. This year's theme, ""A Decade of Innovation: From Silver to Gold"", further underscores the transformative journey we have embarked on using innovation to confront the complexities of an ageing society.

Like many highly-developed regions worldwide, Hong Kong is experiencing rapid growth in our elderly population. By 2043, more than one-third of our population will be elderly, creating a tremendous demand for silver products and services in personal care and healthcare, food and beverages, leisure and recreation, financial services, etc. Promoting silver economy not only enhances the quality of life of our elderly, but also creates new impetus for the growth of Hong Kong's economy through emerging industries and businesses.

To this end, in his 2024 Policy Address, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong announced the establishment of a Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy (the Working Group) chaired by me. In May this year, the Working Group announced 30 measures across five areas, namely: boosting ""silver consumption"", developing ""silver industry"", promoting ""quality assurance of silver products"", enhancing ""silver financial and security arrangements"" and unleashing ""silver productivity"".

In terms of boosting ""silver consumption"", the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB) of our Government has been working with the trade and stakeholders to attract more silver consumption through exhibitions and retail concessions, electronic commerce and catering initiatives. Amongst various exhibitions, this signature exhibition is certainly one of the largest in Hong Kong, showcasing the latest smart ageing technologies, innovative products and services from 200 exhibitors. I am sure that our attendees today can reap the fruits of the business sector's efforts in providing products and services to better meet the elderly's needs and preference.

To tap the huge potential of the senior food catering market, with CEDB's support, several large local restaurant chains have introduced various items of Care Food/soft meals recently and have received encouraging response from the market. I am glad that a number of exhibitors here today are also promoting their Care Food products. The HKSAR Government will continue to work closely with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service and relevant stakeholders to raise the community's awareness of Care Food.

Building a resilient and inclusive financial ecosystem that helps optimise Hong Kong residents' wealth accumulation is important in fostering a thriving silver economy. Echoing the Working Group's measures on enhancing ""silver financial and security arrangements"", I am delighted to note that there will be a dedicated discussion session on ""Unlocking Opportunities in the silver economy: financial planning; savings and insurance decisions; investment strategies wealth and estate management"" at this year's Expo and Summit, and my colleague from the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau will talk about the Government's efforts on this front.

Developing silver economy spans across a wide spectrum, from age-friendly designs, medical financing arrangements to gerontechnology. Therefore, we need the support of the entire community, including the business sector, social leaders and the academia, to join hands in accomplishing this mission. I am confident that the insight, experience and best practices shared by more than 100 influential thinkers and leaders at this Expo and Summit will inspire concrete actions and drive positive changes.

As we celebrate the 10th anniversary of this remarkable event, I thank the Golden Age Foundation once again for organising this visionary summit for our golden and silver agers. I wish the 10th Golden Age Expo and Summit tremendous success, and look forward to seeing innovative solutions and collaborations coming out from this platform. For those of you from the Mainland and overseas, may I also wish you a pleasurable stay in Hong Kong. Thank you very much."
Hospital Authority streamlines clinical research approval to promote medical research development (with photo),2025-07-31 14:00,2025-07-31 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100376.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

  The Hospital Authority (HA) held a sharing session today (July 31) with representatives from the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute (GBAICTI) and Hong Kong's pharmaceutical industry to outline a series of enhancement measures implemented by the HA for promoting clinical research development, including the recently implemented streamlined approval procedures aiming at attracting more clinical research projects from the industry.

  Last year, the HA established a Central Clinical Research and Innovation Office and Cluster Clinical Research Support Offices in each cluster to provide support for frontline healthcare professionals and proactively encourage participation in clinical research. In April this year, the HA further enhanced the application and approval procedures for commercially sponsored clinical research, including revising the long-standing standard clinical research agreement template to provide more up-to-date content and balance the interests of all parties. The HA has also engaged a professional organisation to assist in the review and approval of commercially sponsored clinical research applications, expediting the approval process and timeframe through the incorporation of industry expertise.

  The Director (Quality and Safety) of the HA, Dr Michael Wong, expressed confidence that the new measures will promote the clinical research development. ""As a key player in local clinical research with professional medical teams and extensive healthcare data, the HA has been aligning with government policies and engaging in communication and exchange with various healthcare institutions and industry stakeholders. Through optimising processes and streamlining approval procedures, the HA aims to facilitate efficient implementation and execution of clinical research, fostering a more conducive environment for medical innovation and enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness in international clinical research.""

  About 100 participants in the sharing session included members and representatives from the GBAICTI and the Hong Kong Association of the Pharmaceutical Industry, who had in-depth exchanges on the development of clinical research in Hong Kong.

  The HA Central Institutional Review Board (Central IRB) completed the integration of all cluster Research Ethics Committees in March 2024 and has processed over 1 000 clinical research applications. The Central IRB serves as a co-ordinator and has been further streamlining the research ethics application and approval process and facilitating cross-cluster clinical research applications. Following process optimisation, simple clinical research applications can now be processed through an expedited review procedure, with approval times significantly reduced to within 30 days, while the ethics review for complex research applications can be completed within 60 days.

  The HA will continue to dovetail with government policy directions and the needs of the pharmaceutical industry, deepen collaboration with the GBAICTI, and fully support various clinical research applications, thereby promoting Hong Kong's medical and scientific research, enhancing healthcare standards, and benefitting patients."

醫管局去年成立「中央臨床研究及創新辦公室」，並於各聯網設立「聯網臨床研究支援辦公室」，為前線醫護人員提供支援，積極鼓勵參與臨床研究。醫管局於今年四月進一步優化有關商業贊助的臨床研究申請及審批程序，包括修訂沿用多年的臨床研究協議標準範本，以提供更合時宜及平衡各方利益的內容。醫管局亦已聘請專業機構協助審批涉及商業贊助的臨床研究申請，透過引入行業專業知識，加快審批程序及時間。

醫管局質素及安全總監黃立己醫生相信新措施能推動臨床研究發展。他表示：「醫管局作為本地臨床研究的重要一員，擁有專業醫療團隊及龐大醫療數據，一直積極配合政府政策，與不同醫療機構及醫療業界溝通及交流。醫管局期望透過優化流程及精簡審批程序等措施，促進臨床研究的高效落實與執行，致力為醫療創新營造更有利環境，提升香港在國際臨床研究的競爭力。」

約100名試驗所及香港科研製藥聯會的成員代表出席分享會，共同就本港臨床研究的發展作深入交流。

醫管局中央研究倫理委員會（委員會）於二○二四年三月完成整合各聯網的臨床研究倫理委員會，目前已處理過千宗臨床研究申請。委員會擔當統籌角色，進一步簡化研究倫理的申請和審批流程，便利跨聯網臨床研究的申請。理順流程後，簡單的臨床研究可經快審程序申請，審批時間大幅縮短至30日內，而複雜研究則可於60日內完成審批。

醫管局會繼續配合政府政策方向及醫藥業界的需求，與試驗所深化合作，全力支援不同臨床研究申請，推動香港醫藥科研工作，提升香港醫療水平，造福病人。"

政府修訂政府資助專上課程學額和資助申請資格,2025-07-31 13:30,2025-07-31 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100288.htm,"政府今日（七月三十一日）公布有關政府資助專上課程學額和資助申請資格的修訂：設立兩個學費類別，並修訂有關申請資格準則。有關修訂適用於二○二七／二八及以後學年（二○二七／二八學年的申請周期於二○二六年十月開始），讓受影響人士有合理時間自行作出規劃，並讓大學聯合招生處和各院校（包括大學教育資助委員會（教資會）資助大學、香港演藝學院和職業訓練局）入學事務處有足夠時間作相應的行政安排。

政府發言人說：「根據現行收生安排，獲入境事務處（入境處）首次簽發受養人簽證／進入許可時未年滿18歲的學生，均列為本地學生。近期有意見關注部分學生並無來港居住，卻以本地學生身分申請教資會資助大學的政府資助學額，影響了升讀大學的機會及公帑運用的準確性。」

「為了釐清政府資助專上課程學額和資助申請資格，確保公帑用得其所，教育局考慮海外做法和香港實際情況，認為受養子女須居港滿兩年才符合資格申請政府資助專上課程學額。至於持有全職工作簽證／工作許可證或各項入境計劃下的簽證／進入許可的人士，將不再符合資格申請政府資助專上課程學額。」

有關修訂設立兩個學費類別。第I類別為獲資助的學費。持有下列文件的人士符合資格申請副學位、學士學位及研究院修課課程的政府資助學額：


香港永久性居民身份證、由入境處簽發並顯示持有人享有香港的入境權／居留權的其他文件，以及無條件限制逗留簽證標籤；
單程證；以及
受養人簽證／進入許可：持有人首次獲入境處簽發有關文件時未滿18歲，並須在緊接所修讀課程開課首天前的兩年內居住於香港。就第一年學額而言，為配合院校收生程序，該兩年期將由大學聯合招生處或相關院校按所修讀課程開課首天的日期而適當指明。符合居港規定與否，會在每個學年開始時或之前評定，並在該學年的餘下時間維持不變，而課程學年的首天是按該課程的開課日而定。


第II類別為不獲資助的學費，適用於不符合上述第I類別資格準則的人士，包括：


首次獲入境處簽發受養人簽證／進入許可時未滿18歲、並且不符合兩年居港規定的受養人簽證／進入許可持有人；
全職工作簽證／工作許可證持有人；
各項入境計劃下的簽證／進入許可持有人（包括優秀人才入境計劃、資本投資者入境計劃或輸入中國籍香港永久性居民第二代計劃）；以及
非本地學生（例如：學生簽證／進入許可持有人、非本地畢業生留港／回港就業安排下的簽證／進入許可持有人、首次獲入境處簽發受養人簽證／進入許可時年滿18歲或以上的受養人簽證／進入許可持有人）。


第II類別人士仍可以申請報讀政府資助副學位、學士學位及研究院修課課程，惟須繳付不獲資助的學費。就不獲資助的學費水平，院校可根據既定原則，因應本身情況及課程成本，綜合考慮各種因素，自行釐訂合適的學費水平，並須收取至少足以收回所有額外直接成本的學費。相關學費水平須與非本地學生的學費水平一致。

政府會就上述修訂設立過渡安排，即在二○二七／二八學年（申請周期於二○二六年十月開始）的居港規定設為一年，二○二八／二九學年起才實行兩年的居港規定。

發言人說：「政府在制訂有關修訂時，已充分聽取社會不同意見，並取得適當平衡，相信有關修訂對真正有意來港發展的家庭影響不大。」

就居港規定而言，根據大學聯合招生辦法申請第一年學士學位課程的政府資助學額，申請人須提交以下證明﹕

（一）申請人須提供證明，顯示自己在計至所修讀課程開課當年的五月三十一日為止的兩年期內以全日制學生身分於本港開辦正規課程的學校就讀；或

（二）未能提供上文（一）項所述證明的申請人，可向入境處付費申領涵蓋該段兩年期的出入境紀錄證明，以顯示申請人在該段兩年期內，每年不多於90天不在香港。

至於其他政府資助專上課程的學額，包括教資會資助大學的副學位、高年級學士學位及研究院修課課程的政府資助學額，相關院校在審批有關申請時，亦須採取類似上文所述的做法。

以「本地學生」和「非本地學生」的定義作為基礎的政府獎學金、研究生獎學金或政府資助計劃（例如：「香港未來人才深造獎學金計劃」、「本地研究生學費豁免計劃」、「指定專業／界別課程資助計劃」，以及「為修讀香港自資學士學位課程學生提供的免入息審查資助計劃」）的申請資格準則及相關安排會作相應修訂，以確保處理方法一致。"
Government revises eligibility criteria for government-subsidised post-secondary student places and subsidies,2025-07-31 13:30,2025-07-31 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100290.htm,"  The Government today (July 31) announced the revision of the eligibility criteria for government-subsidised post-secondary student places and subsidies: introducing two categories of tuition fees and revising the eligibility criteria. The revision will apply to the 2027/28 academic year and thereafter (the application cycle for the 2027/28 academic year commencing in October 2026). This will allow the affected persons reasonable time to make their own plans and the Joint University Programmes Admissions System (JUPAS) Office and the admissions offices of various institutions (including the University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities, the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, and the Vocational Training Council) sufficient time to make corresponding administrative arrangements.

 A Government spokesperson said, ""Under the current admissions arrangements, dependant visa/entry permit holders who were below 18 years old when first issued with such visa/entry permit by the Immigration Department (ImmD) are considered local students. There has been recent concern that some of these students did not come to reside in Hong Kong but applied for government-subsidised student places at UGC-funded universities as local students, which affected opportunities for university admission and the targeted use of public funds.

  ""To clarify the eligibility criteria for government-subsidised post-secondary student places and subsidies, and to ensure the proper use of public funds, the Education Bureau, having regard to overseas practices and the practical situation in Hong Kong, considers it necessary for dependant children to reside in Hong Kong for two years before becoming eligible for government-subsidised post-secondary student places. Holders of a full-time employment visa/work permit or a visa/entry permit for various admission schemes will no longer be eligible for government-subsidised post-secondary student places.""

  Two categories of tuition fees are introduced under the revision. Category I refers to subsidised fees. Persons holding the following documents are eligible for government-subsidised student places in relation to sub-degree, undergraduate and taught postgraduate programmes:


A Hong Kong permanent identity card, other documents issued by the ImmD showing the right to land/right of abode in Hong Kong, and a visa label for unconditional stay;
A One-way Permit for entry to Hong Kong; and
A dependant visa/entry permit: holders who were below 18 years old when first issued with such visa/entry permit by the ImmD, provided that they have resided in Hong Kong for two years immediately preceding the first day of their respective programmes. Regarding first-year student places, to facilitate institutions'admissions procedures, the two-year period will be specified appropriately by the JUPAS office or the institutions concerned having regard to the first day of the respective programmes. Whether the residency requirement is met is determined at or before the start of each academic yearand shall remain the same for the remainder of that academic year. The first day of the academic year of a programme is determined by the programme's start day.


  Category II refers to non-subsidised fees and applies to persons not meeting the eligibility criteria in the above-mentioned Category I. These persons include:


Dependant visa/entry permit holders who were below 18 years old when first issued with such visa/entry permit by the ImmD, and they do not meet the two-year residency requirement;
Holders of a full-time employment visa/work permit;
Holders of a visa/entry permit for various admission schemes (including the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, the Capital Investment Entrant Scheme or the Admission Scheme for the Second Generation of Chinese Hong Kong Permanent Residents); and
Non-local students (such as holders of a student visa/entry permit; holders of a visa/entry permit under the Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates; dependant visa/entry permit holders who were 18 years old or above when first issued with such visa/entry permit by the ImmD).


  Category II persons may still apply for government-subsidised sub-degree, undergraduate and taught postgraduate programmes but have to pay non-subsidised fees. The institutions may determine appropriate non-subsidised fee levels, following the established principles, having regard to their own circumstances and programme costs, and taking a holistic view of various factors. The levels have to be at least sufficient to recover all additional direct costs, and to be on par with those applicable to non-local students.

  The Government will put in place a transitional arrangement for the above-mentioned revision, whereby the residency requirement for the 2027/28 academic year (its application cycle commencing in October 2026) will be set at one year. The two-year residency requirement will be implemented starting from the 2028/29 academic year.

 The spokesperson said, ""When formulating the revision, the Government fully listened to various views in society and struck the right balance. The revision is not expected to have a significant impact on families with genuine intentions to come to Hong Kong for development.""

 Regarding the residency requirement for JUPAS applications for government-subsidised first-year-first-degree student places, applicants are required to provide the following proof:

(a) proof from the applicant that he or she is enrolled as a full-time student in a school offering a formal curriculum in Hong Kong for the two-year period ending on May 31 in the year in which his or her respective programme begins; or

(b) for those who cannot provide the proof in (a) above, a statement of travel records of the applicant which can be obtained at a fee from the ImmD covering the two-year period to demonstrate that the applicant is not absent from Hong Kong for a maximum of 90 days in each year of the two-year period.

  Regarding other government-subsidised post-secondary student places, including those in relation to sub-degree, senior year undergraduate and taught postgraduate programmes of UGC-funded universities, the relevant institutions are required to process the applications in an approach similar to the above-mentioned one.

  The eligibility criteria and related arrangements for government scholarship, fellowship or subsidy schemes which are currently premised on the definitions of ""local students"" and ""non-local students"" (such as the Hong Kong Future Talents Scholarship Scheme for Advanced Studies, the Tuition Waiver for Local Research Postgraduate Students, the Study Subsidy Scheme for Designated Professions/Sectors, and the Non-means-tested Subsidy Scheme for Self-financing Undergraduate Studies in Hong Kong) will also be correspondingly revised to ensure consistency."
立法會：商務及經濟發展局副局長就「積極拓展香港新經濟增長點」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-07-31 13:03,2025-07-31 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100389.htm,"以下是商務及經濟發展局（商經局）副局長陳百里博士今日（七月三十一日）在立法會會議上，就「積極拓展香港新經濟增長點」議員議案的總結發言：

主席：

我再次感謝容海恩議員提出的動議，田北辰議員、陳曼琪議員和李浩然議員提出的修正案，以及其他共41位議員就積極拓展香港新經濟增長點的寶貴建議。以下我會作綜合回應。

加強內聯外通、招商引資

首先，我留意到很多議員都希望政府加強內聯外通方面的工作，以及進一步向海內外宣傳我們方方面面的優勢，說好香港故事。

事實上，政府一直透過不同措施提升香港的國際競爭力和吸引力。在《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港整體排名晉身全球首三位最具競爭力的經濟體，在「商業法規」和「稅務政策」排名更是全球第一。今次是自二○一九年後，香港首次重返全球三甲，顯示政府的施政方向整體正確，各項政策取得了成效。尤其在招商引資方面，在二○二三年至二○二五年上半年期間，投資推廣署已協助約1300間企業在港開設或擴展業務，預計帶來直接投資額超過1,600億元，並在有關企業設立或擴展業務的首年，合共創造超過19 000個職位。以上數字已超越二○二二年《施政報告》所訂的績效指標。我們會繼續加強宣傳香港的獨特優勢及新經濟增長點帶來的機遇。

而在深化與內地的聯繫方面，因應內地市場對香港的專業服務需求日漸增加，政府會繼續把握《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》（CEPA）下內地給予香港的優惠措施，助力香港企業和專業人才為內地市場提供優質產品和服務。例如，在CEPA框架下簽訂的《修訂協議二》增加了「港資港法」和「港資港仲裁」作為便利香港投資者的措施，正好支持在粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）試點城市註冊的港資企業。此外，大灣區市場在多個範疇以先行先試的方式對香港作更大程度開放，讓香港服務提供者在大灣區市場提供更多樣化的專業服務，為香港企業和專業人士，以及外來投資者帶來新商機。

在深化與國際市場的聯繫方面，儘管海外市場經濟放緩、地緣政治帶來衝擊、美國的不合理關稅措施等帶來不少挑戰和不明朗因素，政府正積極透過多元化措施開拓新興市場，鞏固香港作為國際貿易中心的地位。自二○二二年上任後，行政長官先後五次率領高級別商貿代表團兩度出訪中東和三度出訪東南亞國家聯盟（東盟），為香港開拓商機及加強與這些經濟體的關係。這些訪問成果非常理想，與東盟各國不同單位簽署接近90份合作備忘錄和協議，涉及範疇廣泛。政府會繼續加強相關工作，積極開拓新經濟增長點。另外，香港會繼續擔當好作為「一帶一路」功能平台的角色，為國家推動共建「一帶一路」作出貢獻。香港將於今年迎來「一帶一路高峰論壇」十周年，論壇訂於今年九月十日至十一日舉行。我們已主動聯繫相關機構和組織，鼓勵它們於論壇前後舉辦與「一帶一路」相關活動以加強協同效應，說好國家及香港故事。

升級轉型、推動創新

剛才，很多議員都提到政府要加大力度幫助業界升級轉型、推動創新。就這一方面，政府正推出多項措施推動高增值產業發展。為進一步推進新型工業化發展，政府已推出一系列支援計劃，包括「新型工業加速計劃」、「新型工業化資助計劃」，支持策略性產業的企業在香港設立新智能生產設施，利用創科升級轉型，轉向智能製造。政府除了將於今年內推出先導計劃為本地製造業提供配對資助，鼓勵業界引入智能生產升級轉型生產線外，亦將設立「創科產業引導基金」，加強引導市場資金投資指定策略性新興及未來產業，系統性建設創科產業生態圈。我們期望透過以上措施促進科技創新與產業創新融合發展，引領香港更好地融入國家產業創新體系。

我亦聽到議員在太空經濟方面的意見和建議，除了在開場發言所提及的措施外，政府亦希望將科研投入成果化，其中InnoHK旗下香港太空機械人與能源中心的研究成果將直接應用於嫦娥八號探月任務，成為中國牽頭建立國際月球科研站先行計劃的重要組成部分，為國家的航天發展作出貢獻。就低軌衞星的工作方面，政府希望經簡化的申請制度能吸引投資、人才和企業以香港作為發展低軌衞星業務的基地。

促進金融創新、締造領先地位

剛才亦有好幾位議員提到促進金融創新。在這方面，政府正就數字資產交易服務提供者和數字資產託管服務提供者發牌制度的立法建議諮詢公眾，諮詢期至八月底。參考公眾意見及市場發展，政府會訂定相關發牌制度的細節，秉持「相同業務、相同風險、相同規則」的原則，促進香港數字資產市場健康、負責任和可持續發展。

利用自身優勢、打造產業多元化

另外，多位議員都提及香港要利用自身優勢、打造產業多元化。事實上，香港絕對有條件利用自身在金融、貿易、專業服務、文化、旅遊、體育、教育等的優勢，配合外來機遇，專門發展有長遠潛力的範疇。

就發展伊斯蘭市場方面，現時本港的金融市場有各種伊斯蘭金融產品及服務，香港金融管理局與沙特阿拉伯公共投資基金簽署諒解備忘錄，共同出資支持創設一項目標規模達10億美元的新投資基金，促進與香港和大灣區有聯繫的企業在沙特當地發展。政府將繼續推展伊斯蘭市場有關金融、經貿及旅遊發展的工作，全方位把握伊斯蘭市場的各種機遇。

在專業認證服務方面，政府會持續提升相關部門的能力，並向業界提供優質的認可服務及推出新認可服務。政府部門亦會善用本港檢測認證業界的專業服務，從而確認市面上的產品及服務符合相關標準，例如議員提及的中藥或白酒等，以保障消費者的利益和安全。

在綠色產業方面，為達致經濟及環境雙贏發展，我們會透過善用已修復堆填區，以及相關科研及技術示範基金等，協助企業在香港推展綠色科技項目。政府正協助兩間本地綠色創科公司設立生產線，利用本地回收廢料，分別升級再造高價值的無電製冷及創冷產品的核心原料，以及高增值的聲學超材料產品。我們會繼續吸引和協助企業在香港發展綠色科技項目，打造香港成為綠色科技示範基地，助力國家輸出綠色科技及產品，爭取國際市場認可及強化競爭優勢。另一方面，政府亦會積極拓寬綠色金融科技生態圈，包括透過資助計劃推動有潛力的綠色金融科技方案於香港的商業環境中更廣泛應用。

在文化創意產業方面，政府會繼續積極落實《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，完善文藝創意產業生態圈。政府已公布改革表演場地的預訂政策，當中包括香港體育館定位由體育優先改為演唱會優先，助力發展演唱會經濟。政府亦會繼續策略性地發掘和支持具產業化潛力的香港文創項目，讓香港的創作「走出去」，同時推進與內地文創品牌的合作，善用內地機遇。

在體育產業方面，政府會把握好啟德體育園的機遇。這兩個星期舉行的「香港足球盛會2025」正好見證世界級足球隊在啟德主場館作賽，不但在社會營造熾熱的體育氛圍，更吸引內地與世界各地遊客訪港觀賽，帶動消費。今年十一月至十二月，香港將與廣東和澳門首次共同承辦第十五屆全國運動會及全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會，預計將吸引超過10萬人次旅客來港觀賽，直接帶動旅遊、餐飲住宿和零售等消費。我們將充分善用這項國家盛事，配合不同的旅遊產品，吸引更多內地和海外遊客來港，進一步提升體育及旅遊的協同效應和相關經濟效益。

在教育產業方面，政府會繼續舉辦國際教育會議及展覽，突顯香港作為國際專上教育樞紐的地位。我們會加強在全球推廣「留學香港」品牌，吸引更多優秀境外學生。政府亦已推出新一輪批地計劃及開辦課程貸款計劃，以象徵式地價批出土地及提供免息貸款，支持自資院校擴容提質。

至於就寵物經濟的建議，相關部門會在今年下旬進行住戶飼養寵物主題性統計調查，從而收集香港家庭飼養寵物的相關數據。調查結果將有助業界了解飼養寵物的最新趨勢，讓商界朋友按市場需求提供產品和服務。

結語

主席，推動經濟發展有賴官、商、民通力合作。今日我很感謝各位議員提出非常有建設性的建議，商經局和其他政策局定必仔細考慮。政府會繼續為香港企業創造有利條件，把握發展機遇，提升香港的競爭力及國際影響力，配合國家戰略發展方向。主席，我謹此陳辭。"

HKTE revamps website to enable talent's convenient search for information (with photo),2025-07-31 13:00,2025-07-31 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100234.htm,"  Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE) revamped its website (www.hkengage.gov.hk) today (July 31), enabling outside talent to efficiently and precisely search for practical information on talent admission schemes, settling in Hong Kong and career development, and promoting Hong Kong's unique advantages and opportunities to attract more international talent to pursue development in the city.

  The revamped website features a new interface with core themes of ""Work"", ""Live"" and ""Thrive"". Key enhanced features include:

(1) an expanded guide to living in Hong Kong to cover 18 categories, including education, healthcare, taxation, etc;

(2) a new dedicated page for HKTE activities, providing one-stop registration services;

(3) an enhanced recruitment platform network; and

(4) the introduction of a chatbot function, providing instant feedback to enquiries from talent.

  The revamped website also provides detailed information about Hong Kong's unique advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle of having the strong support of the country while maintaining unparalleled connectivity with the world, as well as positioning for the development of the ""eight centres"", to attract international high-calibre talent to Hong Kong to seize development opportunities.

  A spokesman for HKTE stated that the revamped website has optimised the user's experience, with clearer categorisation and key information at a glance under a new interface to create a more user-friendly platform for outside talent to obtain information, providing them with the strongest support in pursuing their development in Hong Kong.

  In addition, HKTE has revamped its logo to align with the three core themes of the revamped website. The new logo incorporates the colours of the themes to highlight vibrancy and creativity, symbolising talent settling and thriving in Hong Kong while embracing opportunities."
金管局回應美聯儲議息決定,2025-07-31 12:32,2025-07-31 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100394.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

美國聯邦儲備局（美聯儲）聯邦公開市場委員會經過一連兩天的會議後，在香港時間今日（七月三十一日）清晨公布維持聯邦基金利率目標區間於4.25-4.5厘。

美聯儲維持息率不變的決定符合市場預期。然而，市場普遍認為美聯儲未來的減息步伐仍然存在較大的不確定性，視乎美國通脹和就業數據的走勢，其中關稅措施以及財政政策等對經濟活動的影響尚有待觀察。

香港方面，貨幣及金融市場保持有序運作。港元供應在五月初強勁資金流入後保持充裕，其後市場對港元需求有所減少，套息交易令港匯走弱。六月底以來，港匯數度觸發「弱方兌換保證」，而最近一次是在今晨紐約交易時段觸發。港元流動性逐漸縮減，港元拆息從低位溫和上升，但仍顯著低於美息。目前港美息差對套息交易仍具吸引力，因此令港匯繼續貼近7.85水平，但與此同時，近日股票相關的港元資金需求甚殷，為港匯提供一定支持。往後視乎港元資金供求變化，以及其他不確定因素包括美聯儲貨幣政策和美息走向、股票投資市場氣氛、外圍金融市場及環球資金流向等，「弱方兌換保證」可能會再度被觸發。屆時金管局將按照聯匯制度買入港元沽出美元，銀行體系總結餘將相應下降，而港元拆息將會逐步上升。

美國未來減息的幅度和步伐存在頗大的不確定性，而香港目前的利率環境因為上述各種變數亦可能出現變化，市民在作出置業、投資或借貸決定時，需充分考慮港元息率上升的可能性，並管理相關風險。金管局會繼續密切監察市場變化，維持貨幣及金融穩定。"

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

勞工處發布的《預防工作時中暑指引》，詳細說明進行熱壓力風險評估時應考慮的各項風險因素，並針對各風險因素建議相應的控制措施，供僱主和僱員參閱。有關工作暑熱警告及相關指引，請參閱勞工處專題網頁：www.labour.gov.hk/tc/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm。"

有關個䅁涉及大角咀道一幢住宅大廈一個單位的僭建物，包括在平台上加建一個面積約90平方米的搭建物，以及安裝三個阻礙逃生途徑的鐵閘。該等僭建物並無事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，屋宇署逐根據《建築物條例》第24（1）條向有關業主發出清拆令。由於該業主沒有履行清拆令，故遭屋宇署檢控。

屋宇署發言人今日（七月三十一日）說：「僭建物可導致嚴重後果。業主必須盡快遵從清拆令。對於未有遵從清拆令的業主，屋宇署會繼續採取執法行動，包括提出檢控，以保障樓宇及公眾安全。」

The case involved unauthorised building works (UBWs) in a unit of a residential building at Tai Kok Tsui Road, including the erection of a structure of about 90 square metres on the flat roof, and the installation of three metal gates obstructing the means of escape. As the UBWs were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failure to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (July 31), ""Unauthorised building works may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."
LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-31 11:20,2025-07-31 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100330.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

Director of Health meets Director General of Guangzhou Municipal Health Commission to deepen collaboration between Guangzhou and Hong Kong on communicable disease prevention and control (with photo),2025-07-30 21:52,2025-07-30 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000840.htm,"The Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, today (July 30) led representatives of the department to meet with Director General of the Guangzhou Municipal Health Commission, Ms Chen Bin, in Guangzhou to learn about the latest situation of Chikungunya fever (CF) in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou and the disease prevention measures, as well as share the emergency preparedness adopted in Hong Kong, to deepen thecollaboration between Guangzhou and Hong Kong on disease prevention and control.

""Thanks to the support of the National Health Commission and the Health Commission of Guangdong Province, the joint prevention and control measures of CF fully demonstrates the continuous and deepening co-operation between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao on prevention and control, and emergency response for communicable diseases. Owing to the communicable disease notification mechanism established by the three places, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) has kept abreast of the latest situation of CF in Guangdong Province. To enhance co-operation among professional staff and strengthen experience sharing in epidemic prevention and control, the DH has sent two field epidemiology doctors to join the Foshan Center of Disease Control and Prevention to conduct local epidemiological investigation and epidemic control, including mosquito surveillance, anti-mosquito operations in the community and management of patients, to gain invaluable experience on prevention and control of CF,"" said Dr Lam.

To further understand the latest epidemic prevention and control situation and measures, the DH has also sent a Principal Medical and Health Officer in the field of epidemiology from the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP to visit Foshan this afternoon to exchange views on prevention measures on CF with the staff members of the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration and Foshan Center of Disease Control and Prevention.

The recent spike in CF cases in multiple regions worldwide (including neighbouring areas), and more frequently travelling among members of the public during summer holidays, pose an extremely high risk of imported cases in Hong Kong. The Government has been gearing up for emergency preparedness in response to the possible imported cases of CF, and intensifying publicity and health education across all fronts.

Public Education

The CHP will hold an online live seminar on its Facebook page from 8.30pm to 9pm tomorrow (July 31), to provide the latest information and health advices on CF, and respond to related enquiries from the public. Members of public are welcome to attend.

The CHP has set up mobile promotional booths at multiple locations across Hong Kong (including public markets, community health centres, and shopping malls) to educate the public on how to prevent mosquito-borne diseases. Details can be viewed atwww.chp.gov.hk/en/other/events/476.html.

Members of the public may visit the CF webpage of the CHP and Travel Health Service for the latest information and health advice.

Forum for the industry

The Infection Control Branch of the CHP and the Infectious Disease Control Training Centre of the Hospital Authority jointly organised the first online forum on July 28 for healthcare professionals from the public and private medical institutions. The forum covered topics on epidemiology and latest epidemic situation in Foshan, diagnosis and clinical management of CF, as well as anti-mosquito measures. The forum enhanced healthcare professionals' knowledge on the disease and its responsive measures through sharing and explanation by experts. The CHP will organise a second forum for healthcare professionals tomorrow.

The CHP also issued letters to all doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong to provide them with the latest epidemiological information and appeal them to watch out for CF-related symptoms among those who return to Hong Kong from outbound travel. If CF cases are detected, they should be immediately referred to hospitals for treatment and reported to the DH in accordance with the established mechanism so that the DH can initiate epidemiological investigations, and implement prevention and control measures.

Latest situation regarding CF

According to the information from the Foshan health authority, as of July 28, there were over 5 600 cases in Foshan. The majority of cases (4 890 cases) were in Shunde District. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases so far. Moreover, confirmed cases were also recorded in other cities in Guangdong Province recently. Regarding Macao, as of July 29, there were six imported cases of CF, four of them travelled toFoshan during the incubation period.

In 2019, Hong Kong recorded 11 imported cases of CF. There have been no CF cases since 2020."

The permanent premises of the GCMTI will be completed and commissioned in phases by the end of this year, leveraging its expertise in the research and development of internationally recognised reference standards for Chinese medicines and related products, reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a bridgehead for the internationalisation of Chinese medicines,"" Dr Lam said.

Dr Lam visited the Guangzhou Institute for Drug Control on the same day. The institute, established in 1953, is a technical supporting institution under the Guangzhou Municipal Market Regulatory Administration. It was also one of the first four Port Institutes for Drug Control authorised by the National Ministry of Health and one of the five institutions qualified for conducting inspections of first-time imported drugs nationwide.Currently, the Guangzhou Institute for Drug Control possesses technical advantages in testing the level of pesticide residue, heavy metals and harmful elements, residue of mycotoxins and detection of irradiated Chinese medicines by photostimulated luminescence and thin-layer chromatographic identification of Chinese herbal medicine.

Dr Lam emphasised that the HKSAR Government will establish the ""Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation"" (CMPR) by the end of 2026, consolidating regulatory functions for Western and Chinese medicines, as well as medical devices, and enhancing the existing regulatory regime in a holistic manner, in order to fostering growth in the local healthcare and biotechnology industries. The Co-operation Arrangement will strengthen the collaboration of the regulatory networks between the two regions, further promoting the future development of the CMPR.

​林文健醫生指出： 「感謝國家衞生健康委員會及廣東省衞生健康委員會的支持，是次基孔肯雅熱的聯防聯控工作，充分體現粵港澳三地在傳染病防控及緊急應變等方面的持續深化合作。衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）根據三地建立的傳染病通報機制，充分掌握廣東省近日基孔肯雅熱的最新情況。為促進傳染病專業人員的合作，加強交流疫情防控經驗，衞生署早前已派遣兩名現場流行病學醫生前往佛山市疾病預防控制中心，實地參與當地流行病學調查及疫情防控工作，包括蚊媒監測、社區滅蚊行動，以及患者管理等，以汲取在防治基孔肯雅熱方面的寶貴經驗。」

為進一步了解最新疫情防控情況及措施，衞生署增加委派一位中心傳染病處流行病學首席醫生今日下午到訪佛山市，與廣東省疾病預防控制局及當地疾控中心人員就基孔肯雅熱的防控工作進行深入交流。

由於基孔肯雅熱近期在全球多個地區（包括鄰近地區）錄得案例急升，加上市民在暑假期間會較頻繁外遊，香港出現輸入個案的風險極高，政府一直為可能出現基孔肯雅熱輸入個案做好應急準備，並全方位加強宣傳教育工作。

尊敬的余先河副部長（四川省委統戰部常務副部長）、蘇玉軍部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室社團聯絡部部長）、譚錦球主席（香港四川社團總會創會主席）、唐安英會長（香港四川社團總會會長）、麥美娟局長（民政及青年事務局局長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今天很高興跟大家一起見證香港四川社團總會第二屆理事會執委會就職，同時為「錦繡天府安逸四川」四川非遺文化走進香港演出拉開序幕。

四川素有「天府之國」的美譽，自然資源豐富、文化底蘊深厚。不論是碧水藍天的九寨溝、雲海佛光的峨眉山，還是憨態可掬的國寶熊貓、神秘璀璨的三星堆文明，甚至是傳承千年的川劇藝術和驚艷世界的變臉絕技，這些自然遺產和文化瑰寶塑造了四川獨特的人文景觀，成為國家與世界交流的重要窗口。

四川近年在科技創新、綠色發展等領域都有長足發展，經濟活力持續提升，是國家西部地區經濟的重要引擎，也是西部大開發戰略中的核心省份。二○一八年，香港特區政府與四川省政府建立了川港合作會議機制，為兩地提供了重要的協作平台，有效深化川港合作。香港作為國際金融、貿易和航運中心，擁有強大的經貿網絡和專業的金融服務能力，能夠協助四川招商引資，並支持當地企業開拓海外市場，實現優勢互補，共同推進國家的高質量發展。

初唐文學天才王勃在送友人赴四川上任的名詩句說：「海內存知己，天涯若比鄰。」雖然四川跟香港相隔千里，但兩地人民緊密相連。為了深化川港兩地的連繫，香港四川社團總會自二○一九年成立以來，一直扮演着川港交流與合作的重要橋樑角色。總會不但致力團結在港川籍鄉賢的力量，推動川港兩地互利共贏，更積極加強兩地在經貿、文化、教育等領域的務實合作，促進民心相通。去年，總會聯同特區政府和多個地區團體，舉辦了「喜迎熊貓系列活動」，與香港市民共同慶祝香港大熊貓家庭喜添四位新成員，並藉此掀起「熊貓熱潮」，為香港旅遊發展注入新活力。對於總會的孜孜付出和卓越貢獻，我表示感謝和敬佩。

習近平主席強調，建設文化強國對中國式現代化建設和中華民族復興大業十分重要，並指出我們必須更加主動地傳播中華文化，展示中國形象，提升國家文化的軟實力。今年，總會在四川省政府的大力支持下，開展「錦繡天府安逸四川」四川非遺文化到香港展現。活動邀請多位優秀的四川藝術家來港，為我們帶來變臉、清音等極具傳統特色的表演，同時也把蜀錦、銀花絲、糖畫等非遺工藝帶到香港展出。除了今晚的演出外，總會還會於未來兩天在深水埗和啟德舉行四川非遺文化活動，讓市民近距離感受四川的文化魅力，進一步鞏固兩地人民的情誼。展望未來，我相信總會將繼續發揮同鄉社團的橋樑作用，向海外僑胞和外國友人展現川港兩地的優秀文化藝術創作，說好川港故事、說好中國故事。

最後，我祝願國家繁榮昌盛，川港兩地人和業茂，香港四川社團總會新一屆理事會執委會工作順利，「錦繡天府安逸四川」四川非遺文化走進香港演出圓滿成功！謝謝大家。"

​財政司司長發布《香港營商環境報告：一國兩制 獨特優勢》記者會開場發言及答問內容（附圖／短片）,2025-07-30 20:40,2025-07-30 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000765.htm,"以下是財政司司長陳茂波今日（七月三十日）下午聯同商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺和署理政府經濟顧問林幗瑛博士舉行記者會，發布《香港營商環境報告：一國兩制 獨特優勢》的開場發言及答問內容：

財政司司長：各位傳媒朋友、各位市民，大家好。

政府今日發表新一份《香港營商環境報告》，向社會各界和海內外人士、投資者介紹香港最新的營商環境和各方面優勢。這是特區政府繼二○二一年後再度發表這份報告，目的是系統地向外界清晰說明香港在社會穩定下來、走出疫情之後，這幾年持續向好的發展。這信息在當前複雜多變的地緣政治環境是重要的，讓世界各地的商界朋友及投資者，更深入了解香港不同領域的實況及機遇，充分利用香港在「一國兩制」下內聯外通的獨特優勢，以及作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的功能，為他們所帶來的龐大機遇。

報告詳列了不同的數據，闡述香港因着制度優勢與不斷提升的競爭力，進一步吸引了資金流入、企業和人才匯聚，成果顯著；在多項外商調查以至多項國際排名方面均廣受認同。這些事實全方位說明了香港開放、安全、穩定、可靠、高效和國際化的營商環境。

事實上，多組數字都反映了國際投資者對香港的信心正進一步提升，例如：

股市表現穩步向上：恒生指數繼去年上升18%後，今年以來再上升了27%，上半年每日成交額上升120%至2,400億元。今年截至七月中，港股有52隻IPO，即新股集資，集資額接近1,300億元，按年上升約6倍。
吸引海內外企業：去年，母公司在境外的香港公司接近10 000家，按年上升10%。引進重點企業辦公室自二○二二年年底以來，引進了84家重點企業，它們合共會投資約500億元，創造20 000個職位，而它們所使用的樓面面積都達到168萬平方呎；此外，在二○二三年一月至二○二五年上半年，投資推廣署亦協助了超過1 300家海內外企業在港開設或拓展業務，帶來約1,600億元投資。
吸引人才：各項引進人才計劃共收到約50萬份申請，已批出33萬個申請，約22萬人已經抵達香港。
國際排名：在瑞士洛桑國際管理發展學院的《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港連續兩年上升合共四位，登上全球第三；另外，今年初的國際金融中心排名，香港繼續位列三甲；而去年十月，加拿大菲沙研究所《世界經濟自由度2024年度報告》，香港亦都再次名列第一。而三大評級機構，最近均一致給予香港良好的信用評級和「穩定」的評級展望等。


在這幾年，國安法的實施讓香港重建安全穩定的環境，不僅保障了市民大眾的權利和自由，同時也讓香港成為更吸引國際資金和投資的安全港。

短期而言，香港的經濟在去年增長2.5%，今年首季增長3.1%。明日我們會公布第二季的本地生產總值預估數字，估計增長勢頭保持，這將是連續第十個季度增長。出口、整體投資、私人消費預計均會錄得正增長。政府通過積極推動旅遊業及盛事項目帶動消費氣氛，消費市道呈初步回穩的跡象；住宅物業市場亦趨向穩定。政府會繼續透過多項措施支援面對挑戰的行業，例如資金周轉、市場開拓、數字化轉型等，以提升其競爭力和生產力等。

總的而言，面對複雜多變的外圍環境，香港經濟結構正在升級轉型，我們看到的機遇大於挑戰。金融市場表現亮麗、創科產業快速發展，傳統行業也積極轉型升級，一些面對挑戰的行業，例如零售、餐飲等，也有穩住的勢頭。宏觀而言，有國家的支持，政府、各界和市民的共同努力，只要我們準確識變、科學應變、主動求變，必定可以取得新的突破，發展新的增長點，為香港開創新局面。

我的開場發言到此，看看大家有沒有甚麽提問。

記者：三位你們好。想先問你們三位如何評估香港下半年，甚至全年的經濟增長的前景？接下來有一些譬如是關稅措施，對於香港的營商環境會否帶來一些變數？第二，見到有不少外資來到，國際排名都有些上升，但直接貼近民生的，例如餐飲、零售，以至戲院行業，又如何受惠？謝謝。

財政司司長：多謝你。我們估計香港下半年會維持經濟增長。今年第一季本地生產總值增長3.1%，第二季的數字明天公布，大致上會維持這個勢頭。現時在地緣政治和關稅戰下，外圍環境是複雜多變，亦有很多不確定性，具體增長要同時看推動增長的「三頭馬車」：出口、消費和投資。關稅戰對出口的影響還要視乎具體措施如何。過去這段時間，內地從事出口的企業其實已經在海外，尤其是東南亞，重新布局其產業鏈和供應鏈，以緩減關稅對它們的影響。至於消費方面，我們看到的數字顯示消費是穩定下來，待會我請政府經濟顧問仔細跟大家說明。在旅客訪港方面，增長勢頭是非常好，加上特區政府一直舉辦不同盛事活動吸引旅客，我們見到上半年旅客增長數字是雙位數，尤其是國際旅客的增長更為顯著，這對於我們的市道都會有一定幫助。

目前來說，香港經濟正經歷轉型階段，在轉型階段裏，不同行業以至企業，其反應和調整進程都未必完全一樣，步伐亦未必一致。我們見到一些行業是比較好，譬如一些新興行業如創科和Web 3.0，即金融科技、數字資產這一塊；但同時亦有一些行業，尤其是傳統行業，在轉型過程中遇到一些挑戰和壓力。我們會盡力支持他們轉型：資金方面有不同的貸款擔保計劃；如果他們是出口企業則在市場推廣方面，至於本地零售和餐飲企業，我們通過不同的計劃助力它們的數碼轉型和升級，這都是希望幫助它們更快更好地適應這個轉變中的環境。

署理政府經濟顧問：我或許補充一些數據給大家。其實早前已經公布的零售業總銷貨價值（二○二五年五月份零售業銷貨額臨時統計數字）在連續下跌14個月後，今年五月已經轉跌為升，（數字）為2.4%。相關六月的數字（二○二五年六月零售業銷貨額統計）很快會作出公布，相信也會穩住勢頭。

至於食肆方面，第一季（二零二五年第一季食肆收益及購貨額臨時統計數字）的情況輕微下跌0.6%，但是初步數字顯示第二季也見到回穩，這是零售和餐飲的情況。

剛才司長也提到訪港旅客的數目，上半年錄得雙位數增長，直至七月，我們留意到首28日的數字按年上升12%，所以相關勢頭仍然維持。在這個背景下，明日會公布GDP（本地生產總值）數字（二○二五年第二季本地生產總值預先估計數字），所以在這些穩定的情況之下，以及看到現在的消費氣氛有些回穩，私人消費開支在第二季有望止跌回升。以上是我的補充，謝謝。

記者：都想延續講講零售業的話題，因為看到近年有些零售或者食肆都說他們受「內捲」這個問題所影響。其實你們在這方面怎樣可以幫助到他們零售業在現時這個經營狀況比較困難的情況之下，幫他們成功轉型？另一方面，就是講到政府很大力地推進盛事經濟，今年都見到早前的足球賽事的反應都非常好，其實你們未來明年在盛事經濟方面的計劃會是怎樣？會聚焦哪一個方面去做？以及有些坊間的意見建議你們向中央爭取明年APEC財長會議在香港舉行，政府的態度是如何？另一方面，談到剛剛銀行公布的業績都說到房地產對他們的壞帳影響其實都開始浮現出來。政府現時如何看房地產市道，除了房地產市道的走勢和對其他各個香港經濟不同環節，例如是銀行業的穩定方面，其實你們的看法是如何？多謝。

財政司司長：多謝你。零售和餐飲方面在這段時間事實上遇到壓力。在經濟轉型過程中，商戶要不斷就着市場變化、客戶喜好、對購物、餐飲等消費體驗和需求的轉變，要想不同辦法推陳出新。

我們見到市面上有個別商戶在轉型過程中做得不錯，當然，亦有一些面臨的壓力比較大。我們希望繼續多方面支持努力打拼的企業，尤其不少是中小型企業，包括剛才所說在資金周轉、以資訊科技提升其競爭力、提升效率等，以至搞旺市面的氣氛，最重要是人丁旺，氣氛好，大家就會有興趣出來消費。

這就帶到你剛才提到的盛事。今年我們安排了不少盛事活動。早前大家在啟德體育園都看過不同比賽，亦有演唱會和其他活動。未來，我們會用好這個重要的基建設施，主辦更多活動。

明年的盛事，稍後會再作公布。盛事並不單是旅遊，亦包括體育，以至其他活動。而就旅遊而言，旅客除了來購物以外，也可在港深度遊，以至主題旅遊，這些都是我們正在全力開拓的方向。

同時，我們亦鼓勵跨界別的合作，例如最近在啟德體育園的比賽，附近的酒店和食肆會合作推出項目。這類跨界別合作，令旅客有更好的體驗，覺得更物有所值。

剛才你提到一些活動的主辦，請恕我在此不就個別項目回應。總的來說，在特區政府來說，未來不同類型的盛事，不管是金融、體育、文化等，我們都會繼續大力去推動。同時，我們亦鼓勵私人機構舉辦盛事，例如旅遊事務署和旅遊發展局很樂意幫助他們舉辦不同項目，讓在活動舉辦期間來到的客人覺得更好玩、更開心，可以在香港逗留得更久，多住一兩晚。

我們鼓勵在香港的私人機構，例如金融機構以至其他機構舉辦活動。最近的動漫節，參與程度相當踴躍，參加的人士除了來自內地之外，也有不少來自東南亞，甚至遠道從歐美而來。我們希望通過不同類型的活動，「百貨應百客」，能夠多方面吸引不同人士來到香港。

我們曾與主辦單位和來到香港參加活動的朋友談起，很多人都很享受在香港的旅程，覺得這個城市除了很安全、出入很方便以外，亦是多姿多彩。

你最後關於銀行業績的問題。就本港的房地產市道而言，住宅樓宇的樓價是趨向平穩的，特別是看看最近這三個月，可以說是有輕微、約百分之零點幾的上升，總的來說平穩。

商業和辦公樓方面，可能還需要一些時間去恢復。畢竟過去一段時間，有一定的供應；另一方面，疫情之後的辦公方式，亦轉變了很多。而營商方式方面，例如銷售途徑等亦起了不少變化，例如電商的流行。

在政府而言，我們正處理這個問題，例如我們已經沒有賣商業用地，不在這個時間增加供應，給時間市場消化目前市面上的樓面面積。同時間，亦由需求方面着手。這有幾方面，一是鼓勵非政府機構，如果要用地方，同時有財力的話，可以購置辦公地方，港交所便是其中一個例子。

除此之外，在現時經濟轉型中，個別有些行業的景況不錯，大家可以見到在中環有一些大型跨國金融機構一下子便租很多層的樓面面積，尤其做財富和資產管理的金融機構。我們亦見到一些對沖基金大規模擴充辦公的地方。

此外，我們也見到有一間從事第三代互聯網的企業整幢購入兩幢大廈，一幢在銅鑼灣，另一幢在灣仔，來做第三代互聯網、金融科技方面的業務。所以，當我們努力發展經濟、招商引資，越來越多企業進駐香港的話，他們就需要用地方，這樣就可消化辦公樓面。

我剛才說，引進重點企業辦公室引進了大概80多間重點企業，總投資約500億元。我們統計過，這些企業用到約168萬平方呎的樓面；投資推廣署方面，引進公司的數量就更大。

另一方面，我們亦盡量配合市場上把寫字樓、按它們的位置和市場需要轉型做其他用途，例如一間大學在紅磡購買了整座樓來做學生宿舍等。這即是說，靈活一點以不同用途來把存貨盤活。

總括而言，我們是從供應到需求雙管齊下，處理目前的辦公樓存貨。

至於銀行業績方面，整體而言本港銀行在這兩年其實利潤相當不錯。當然，每間銀行的個別情況有點不相同，我亦不會評論個別銀行，因為不同銀行發展業務時有不同重點。但有一點都可以說的，就是整體我們銀行的壞帳撥備，其實在全球的標準來說，都是處於一個非常穩健的水平。個別有些銀行的經營利潤比較好，尤其在過往一段時間，有些銀行做資產管理、財富管理，以至因應資本市場好、股票市場暢旺，從資本市場方面賺得豐厚利潤，這樣的話就讓他們有更好的條件就着一些呆壞帳--有時也未必實際是壞帳，而是銀行想審慎一點，加大撥備，這方面也不出奇。

總的來說，即使是作出撥備之後，整體來說，銀行的資本充足率達到約21%，其實環球的標準要求都只是8%，而且它們的流動性很充裕。

從這個角度來看，我們認為金融體系、銀行體系仍然是非常穩健。我們在多年前，在二○二／二一年，差不多是COVID前，已經就商業銀行信貸在宏觀審慎方面下工夫。

記者：你好，想問對上一次是二○二一年發布這份報告，有否說為甚麼今次會選擇這個時間推出？數字說得那麼好，但其實市民好像看不到。今次發布這份報告是否想穩定民心？另外之前網誌說過現時香港在經濟轉型的階段，會幫忙轉型，有沒有一些具體措施？謝謝。

財政司司長：經濟方面，如果我們看數字，正如剛才政府經濟顧問所說，我們去年錄得經濟增長，今年第一季亦繼續增長，第二季亦會維持增長幅度，整年來說，二○二五年都維持經濟增長。但經濟正在轉型中，一是因應地緣政治，二是面對科技變革，三是數字化轉型加快，這些都使得競爭十分激烈。所以香港經濟正轉型，這是結構性轉型──包括產業結構的改變。除了國際金融中心、貿易中心外，推動我們下一步經濟增長的重要動力是創新科技，但創新科技不只是香港獨有。環顧全球，國家之間、經濟體之間的競爭，都圍繞創科的發展和應用，而這方面是需要時間來培育的。過去這段時間，我們積極培育創科產業，無論在投資和就業方面，相關增長都相當快，剛才我已用引進重點企業辦公室的數字向大家說明。但同時，一些傳統行業，譬如大家剛才所說的零售和餐飲業，事實上是有壓力的，這個我們很理解。在政府來說，我們也想方設法提供一些支援。當然最大的幫助是人流更旺、生意更好，所以我們很努力舉辦更多盛事，又爭取內地來港旅客的購物免稅額度增加，這方面我們會繼續努力看看是否可以有進一步增加的可能。而旅客來到，我們的旅遊體育文化設施等各方面是否可以更加吸引？是否可有更多不同活動，讓旅客留更長時間？有更多人逗留，在這裏的消費便更多。這是大家正在努力的方向。

至於一些受壓比較大的行業，除了剛才說的餐飲和零售，還有建造業。就建造業而言，我們認為會趨向穩定。為何這樣說？住宅物業市場現時已穩定下來，當住宅物業市場穩定下來，當目前的一些樓盤──譬如最近期一些一手樓盤，開售的市價相當「貼市」且賣得不錯──當這些動起來時，接下來二手樓樓市便會動起來。目前息口減下來的速度和幅度比大家原本想像來得慢，因為美國面對通脹等問題。但最近兩、三個月，因為外來的資金很多，使香港的資金更充裕，所以銀行同業拆息低了很多，這除了減輕了企業經營的壓力，也對住宅市場提供了一定支持。

隨着我們的經濟持續發展，市場對住宅物業自然有更大需求。企業來到這裏擴充業務，亦會衍生更大的需求。至於我剛才提到吸引人才，通過不同的輸入人才計劃，我們批了近33萬宗申請，來了約22萬人，其他人會陸續來。陸續來的也不會是自己一個人來，很多是帶同家庭來的，這些人才相對來說比較年輕，收入亦相對較高。這些都是消費力，也是我們物業市場下一階段的購買力。去年樓價下跌，但租金上升，即樓價和租金背馳，這個現象説明甚麼呢？可以這樣看，一方面，當樓價下跌，大家想買樓時會怕它未止跌，暫時不入市，所以會暫時租住。從外面移居來港的人初到來，大多是先租住，先看一下自己是否適應，另一方面是看看孩子在哪裏讀書，才決定住在哪裏。我們估計這些都會是日後的購買力。此外，一些內地來的朋友如果要買樓，會需要資金，內地的資金是否能夠調動出來，目前來說可調出來的資金相對還有一些限制，我們正努力跟相關的中央部委研究是否可以在一個合適的範圍內，就這方面有所放寬，讓內地朋友更便利地將資金調過來，又不會因此造成資本外流。如果可以這樣做的話，他們也會成為購買力的一部分。

對各位市民來說，在現時的轉型過程中，事實上有不少人的壓力很大、這點我們明白。我們都很努力，希望通過一步步的工作，當成果顯現出來的時候，大家都會受惠。現時整體失業率大約是3.5%，但收入中位數持續上升。換句話說，現時最大的挑戰就是在轉型過程裏，個別行業和部分市民未能完全受惠，因此我們會提供更多支援。這包括職業再培訓計劃，而就青年人而言，我們也有不同計劃，包括幫助他們創業、提供實習機會，希望從多方面協助大家更容易適應這個過程，也提升自己。謝謝。

"Remarks at press conference on ""Report on Hong Kong's Business Environment: Unique Strengths under 'One Country, Two Systems'"" (with photos/video)",2025-07-30 20:40,2025-07-30 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000768.htm,"  The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan; the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau; and the Acting Government Economist, Dr Cecilia Lam, held a press conference on the ""Report on Hong Kong's Business Environment: Unique Strengths under 'One Country, Two Systems'"" this afternoon (July 30). Following are their remarks:

Reporter: I have some questions. First of all, this report seems that it is a wrapping up of all the measures over the past few years. So, what is the significance of this report to Hong Kong's future development? Also, amid the rising challenges such as the tariff increases, how are you going to convince foreign chambers or investors to invest in Hong Kong? The last question is about the reports of the developer of 11 Skies of the Airport City project, with some reports saying that the developer has intended to sell this mega project, because of lack of tenants and also lacklustre prospects. So what is your take on the proposal of selling 11 Skies to other parties? Thank you.

Financial Secretary: Thank you. First, the significance of this report. Over the past few years, because of COVID, a lot of overseas visitors didn't have the opportunity to visit Hong Kong. Given the geopolitical landscape, there has been some misperception about the situation of Hong Kong in the western world. . We are trying very hard to reach out to the international community, to explain to them what is really happening here in Hong Kong by sharing facts and data. The purpose of this report is to recap our developments in a concise report for distribution to them, and this report will be made available online, accessible to anyone who is interested.

 On the question of tariffs, on the question of the China-US geopolitical tension, of course, there are challenges, for example, in terms of exports, but there are also opportunities in respect of the international financial centre status of Hong Kong. For challenges on export, the direct impact is minimal because Hong Kong is basically a service economy; we don't have much manufacturing. On the other hand, the indirect impact could be significant, because we re-export for the Mainland. But over the years, we have seen a number of trends. One of them is Mainland companies realigning their industry bases and supply chains across Southeast Asia. For exports to certain markets, such as the US, a lot of the exports come from those regions. When you look at the figures - the export figures from the Mainland to the US, or from the Mainland via Hong Kong to the US - the share of US in Mainland's total export has been declining.

 From our standpoint, we are adjusting our position. In addition to doing re-export, we have shifted to provide high-value supply chain management and the related trade finance and professional services. That is our response. For opportunities, I think we should not underestimate them. Given the geopolitical landscape, it is increasingly difficult for Mainland companies to go to the US for listing. These companies, would naturally want to come to Hong Kong for listing, because by coming to Hong Kong, they can access both international and Mainland capital. This is a very interesting value proposition to them, and has been demonstrated by the figures so far this year. In fact, we have over 200 companies in the pipeline waiting for listing. But the opportunities are more than the IPO market. Say in asset and wealth management, residents in the GBA (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area) are interested in having certain assets allocated offshore. Naturally, Hong Kong is the destination. The recent improvement in February last year to the GBA Wealth Management Connect - with the implementation of those measures, we have seen significant inflow of capital from the GBA into Hong Kong. In addition, we also have observed capital flow from the Middle East and ASEAN in the asset and wealth management sector. We are quite confident that, by the year 2027 and 2028 the latest - we will overtake Switzerland in cross-border wealth management.

 Another dimension is Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" under the current geopolitical situation. We have observed Mainland companies' keen interest to go global. First, this is national policy, i.e. high-level two-way opening up. Second, there is also a need, because these companies want to utilise the production capacity they have and do more exports. What we have been pitching to them is that the best way to do it is to come to Hong Kong, set up a company, use Hong Kong as a platform as well as a brand to go overseas. In our experience in engaging the Middle East and ASEAN, the value of the ""Hong Kong brand"" is very much respected. This is one way in which we can help them. In the process, Our professional services and other service providers will benefit.

 Finally, on 11 Skies, I won't comment on individual projects. But overall, the attitude of the Government is that, given the economic transition, and given the challenges currently in the non-domestic property market, banks should be supportive to their clients and help them ride through challenges. In the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, HKMA, a working group has been set up between the Hong Kong Association of Banks and the HKMA. This working group deals with individual cases with a view to helping the communication between the banks and borrowers, so that the lenders can extend a more accommodative and facilitative approach to help borrowers who have a viable business model and have a genuine interest in carrying on their business, but are just facing a liquidity crunch. That is the overall attitude of the Government. Thank you.

Reporter: Hi Mr Chan. So, I just want to follow up on the previous question first. So what's the significance of issuing the report now, like after the previous issuance of four years ago? Like, why does the Government choose to issue the new report at present? And also, you mentioned a lot of positive signs in the markets, like the stock markets booming, and Hong Kong also saw a record capital inflows in the first half of the year. So why does the Government still remain quite conservative over an uptick of the annual GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth target for the whole year? And also, how do you see the sustainability of such momentum moving forward? And second question I also want to ask about four sectors that are facing structural changes, like you mentioned, to the retail and catering. Do you see the need to further enhance the support measures besides helping them achieve digital transformation? And finally, about the tariff truce, so the Chinese and US (United States) officials just reached agreements to extend their tariff suspension. So how do you assess the impacts on local business, and would the Government take any steps to help, perhaps exports or local businesses to take this opportunity? Thank you.

Financial Secretary: Thank you. Well, the last report was published in 2021. Over the past few years, because of COVID, a lot of overseas travellers hadn't come to Hong Kong. Given the geopolitical landscape, the perception about Hong Kong in the Western world is not entirely factual and correct. There are some misconceptions. So the purpose of this report is to show to them the current situation in Hong Kong, so that they will be able to better understand what is happening in this city. If they are interested, they are welcome to visit us to see for themselves what it is really like here and the tremendous opportunities available.

 As regards the question about the GDP estimate for the whole year, the GDP growth for the first half of this year has been positive. For the first quarter, the growth was 3.1 per cent; for the second quarter, we have maintained the momentum. But given the geopolitical landscape, there are enormous uncertainty and volatility. At this stage, we think it would be prudent to keep the current GDP estimate. There is in fact a mechanism, a defined timetable for reviewing the GDP estimate regularly. On a published timeline, the Government Economist will share with the community the economic situation, and determine at that time whether to make any revision. It's better to follow that established practice as it provides certainty to the market.

 As to supporting the retail and catering sector, we will keep an open mind. I have elaborated on the situation and how we have been trying to help, but we will continue to closely monitor the situation and if necessary, roll out measures. At this stage, we think the current support measures should stay. Let us observe for a longer time. We have been providing various support measures such as the BUD Fund (Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales) for marketing development and e-commerce. Algernon would share more about that.

Before passing to Algernon, I would say the recent discussions leading to the temporary suspension of tariff rise is, of course, a positive sign. But on the other hand, we are conscious of the fact that things can change overnight. There is still tremendous uncertainty, and consequently, volatility. So for our work, first, we need to ensure financial stability and financial security. On the other hand, stay on course, focus on what we have set out to do, and be persistent with our efforts. That includes reinforcing our relationship with traditional markets like Europe and the US, and at the same time, opening up new markets and new capital sources from the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Thank you, Algernon please.

Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development: Regarding the challenges facing the retail and food and beverage sectors, we have different measures and funding helping the retail sector, such as the BUD Fund. We are also encouraging the sectors to look for changes and transformation, and e-commerce is one of the measures that we promote. Just today, we are going to launch the Hong Kong Shopping Festival for cross-border e-commerce to allow the retail sector to do more e-commerce business. For the maximum cumulative funding of $7 million per enterprise under the BUD Fund, they can apply for $1 million for e-commerce business to arrange for promotion and advertising for e-commerce business across the border.

There are also measures to encourage tourists to come to Hong Kong. Actually, the number of tourists coming to Hong Kong is increasing. It is a positive sign that would help the retail sector. But most importantly, as mentioned by the Financial Secretary, it is time for transformation. We have to look at customer behaviour and their needs, and how we can satisfy customer demand. It is one of the major issues that we have to jointly resolve with enterprises. I have met with different chambers and associations of the retail sector. We had very good discussions on helping them to tackle the challenging situation. As mentioned by the Financial Secretary, we will keep an open mind to look at the situation and to see whether there is a need to introduce further measures to help the retail and food and beverage sectors. Thank you.

Financial Secretary: We should be very confident in Hong Kong's attractiveness as a hub for foreign businesses and talent. Over the past few years, I've been travelling a lot and also heavily engaged with the foreign business community in Hong Kong. I can summarise three key reasons why people should choose Hong Kong. First is, of course, for business reasons. Hong Kong has the proximity and sometimes priority access to the Mainland market. Depending on which sector you are in – if you are in the tech sector, say in the biotech sector, Hong Kong has an additional advantage because of our proximity to Shenzhen, and we are part of the GBA (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area) which is a technology hub. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster is very competitive in innovation.

 Apart from that, it is the capital market and the full range of funding options available here. For companies at different development stages, whether they are start-ups or others, we welcome them. In Hong Kong, we have around 4,700 start-ups, and the number represents a significant increase compared to that a few years ago. About 20 per cent of their founders come from overseas, and they come here for funding, professional advice, mentoring, and opportunities. In my discussions with the start-ups in Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport, they value these as well as the innovation ecosystem very much. For start-ups, what they need are application scenarios, professional advice and funding support, and they are all available here. In Hong Kong, we have set up the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, which provides patient capital. This means that if enterprises are engaged in cutting-edge technologies, we are willing to support them from small, and help them grow and connect them with fund managers to raise funds.

The second reason is for their families and children. It is well recognised Hong Kong's law and order is excellent. We are a very safe city. Education here is also outstanding. Moreover, this is an open and multicultural society, and it is very free. We have gathered a lot of overseas professionals and foreign businessmen here.

Finally, it is about our lifestyle. Whether it is city life, F&B (food and beverage) or our countryside. So with all these, I think if we play our cards right, Hong Kong's opportunities in the future are tremendous. Thank you for attending this conference. I appreciate your time. Thank you.

​立法會：運輸及物流局局長根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》及《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》動議的兩項擬議決議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 19:15,2025-07-30 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000711.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》及《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》動議的兩項擬議決議案的總結發言：

主席：

感謝各位議員剛才表達的寶貴意見，我一一細心聆聽，現在此作一個綜合的回應。

首先，今日就這兩項動議，我們的目的很簡單、很直接，就是提升道路安全和維持路面的交通暢順。在香港，道路的空間實在是有限，有私家車亦有商用車，之後我會再談及商用車。剛才有多位議員都提到自己或其他從社會上聽到的意見，作為駕駛者，當去到某些地區想泊車然後消費、吃東西，或有一些夜間的經濟活動，正因為某些地區在某些時段會有特別多的私家車使用者到訪。即使那個區域有兩條或三條行車線，亦可能會因為車位有限，有私家車或會停泊而佔用了兩條行車線，導致只得一條行車線供其他人使用，造成交通擠塞，這些情況現時在社會不時出現。

今日我聽到多位議員都對特區政府提出這個就一些定額罰款作出水平調整的動議，大部分都表示認同和理解，尤其是對於調整19項有關道路安全和導致交通擠塞相關的一些罰款額，多位議員剛才的發言都表示認同，亦都認為有需要增加阻嚇力。其中有個別議員提及希望做到有效的交通管理，以及減少路面擠塞，提升行人的過路安全。局方和署方（運輸署）未來會大力積極推動利用科技在道路和行人路過路設施上，包括交通燈實時管控，亦會有一些比較創新的設計，這是我們未來的方向。

不少議員發言關注泊車位供應。正如我在開場發言提及，接下來我想聚焦講述未來的策略，以積極回應多位議員剛才提及包括商用車方面的關注。政府過去幾年積極推展一系列短期及中長期措施，採取多管齊下的策略，全方位、默默耕耘增加泊車位，當中包括政策創新、多利用科技、推動不同部門加強合作，努力盡快優先滿足商用車輛的泊車需求。跟大家分享一下整體的數字，透過不同措施提供的泊車位總數達30 000個，商用車位佔了三分之一，而過去三年新增的泊車位則超過15 000個。泊車位與領牌車輛數目的比例，以私家車為例，由二○二一年的1.09逐漸回升至現時的1.14，增長達4.6%，可見增加泊車位措施已漸見成效。

展望未來，政府預計未來兩年內新增泊車位數量將超過12 000個，包括至少700個商用車泊位。另外我們會努力在新短期租約停車場及私人項目提供更多泊位，並聚焦於增加商用車泊位，特別是剛才盧偉國議員和陳紹雄議員均提到的分區情況──較為短缺及違例泊車比較常見的地區如觀塘、葵青、黃大仙、油尖旺及深水埗。就分區做一些指標未必切實可行，我們認為必須要由源頭做起，尤其是一些商用車泊位。很多司機在一日營運之後，可能會回到所居住的地方，譬如一些公共屋邨，所以我們的策略要更加聚焦他們的居住地或者在鄰近地方尋求一些泊車位。惟土地空間真的有限，我們希望盡量靈活使用一些土地。我今日向大家強調，具體和具針對性的措施總共有八項：（i）未來在規劃新發展區時，在道路設計上配置夜間路旁商用車泊車位，供商用車夜間停泊；（ii）積極安排於現有公營房屋開放更多上落客貨處，供商用車夜間停泊，以配合普遍居於公營房屋的商用車司機需要；（iii）安排非住宅用地的附屬泊車位和上落客貨處予商用車於夜間停泊；（iv）現時全港已設有約1 800個夜間路旁泊車位，未來運輸署會加大力度，搜尋更多合適的夜間路旁泊車位，尤其是公共屋邨鄰近位置；（v）鑑於過去幾年商用車位流失主因是許多短期租約停車場被收回，未來我們在決定這些土地的用途時，會加重照顧商用車泊位需求的考量，例如我們近期再與各政府部門加強商討，爭取短期內可在短期租約停車場再增加200個商用車車位，運輸署會繼續爭取設置更多的短期租約停車場；（vi）按二○二一年修訂的《香港規劃標準與準則》的首批資助房屋將於明年陸續落成，我們預計在按照此《準則》而落成及設計的資助房屋中，提供4 800個停車位，當中包括超過200個商用車位；（vii）進一步鼓勵私人停車場採用自動泊車系統。我們計劃在二○二六年或之前，提供不少於3 000個自動化泊車位，現時有五個自動化公眾停車場的工務工程項目正處於興建階段，包括位於將軍澳、新蒲崗及深水埗，而這些系統將會提供多種不同類型的自動泊車系統，包括拼圖型、立體型和圓筒型；再加上六個分布在荃灣、大埔、深水埗、馬鞍山、油麻地的短期租約停車場；我們會爭取在今年年底至二○二九年期間落成有關項目；（viii）正如剛才多位議員提到，除了硬件，在軟件方面，我們會透過加強應用科技和數據以增加泊車位的資訊發放，大幅利用科技提升駕駛者的泊車效率和體驗，引入自動泊車系統以善用空間增加車位密度，亦希望透過應用程式提供實時空置泊車位資訊，以便利駕駛者尋找泊車位，現時已覆蓋超過700個停車場的12萬個泊位和分布全港十八區的全部兩萬多個路旁咪錶位，並透過修例容許駕駛者使用遙控泊車功能，方便他們在狹窄車位泊車。透過上述的八項措施，我很有信心並承諾會令未來香港的泊車位供應持續大為改善，至於商用車位方面，我們定下一個務實目標──未來新增商用車泊位的速率會比過往更加快。

執法方面，警務處進行交通執法時，主要考慮是確保道路安全，減少意外及傷亡，以及維持道路暢通。警務處早前已向立法會交通事務委員會報告前線人員會在不影響道路安全的前提下，視乎現場實際環境靈活判斷，或會就個別情況作酌情處理。根據警方提供的資料，警務人員除了會按照既定的執法指引，亦會視乎每宗個案的相關情況作出考慮，包括評估涉事的車輛是否會造成交通阻塞或構成危險；違例的情況會否屬於一些重點交通執法項目之中，特別是和交通擠塞相關的情況；駕駛者有沒有具備一個合理的原因，以及他們會在合乎指引的情況下適當行使酌情權，例如發出警告以代替用檢控方式處理、違例泊車如果並未造成很嚴重的阻塞，而司機亦都願意立即駛走，在這些情況下警方都有一個詳盡的指引執法。

主席，是次建議的罰款額的調整，相較過去三十多年的通脹率，加幅相對溫和。在考慮的時候，我們希望做到情理兼備，既有助加強阻嚇作用，亦保障交通安全和交通暢順，同時已充分考慮運輸業界的經營情況。收費調整永遠沒有一個好的時機，但是多年不調整的話，會令阻嚇力有所減低。我們希望透過這次修例，再配以我剛才所述的不同的措施，持續去加強道路的安全和提升交通管理上的效率。

主席，我懇請各位議員支持並通過這兩項決議案。多謝主席。"

立法會：商務及經濟發展局副局長就「積極拓展香港新經濟增長點」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 18:52,2025-07-30 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000710.htm,"以下是商務及經濟發展局副局長陳百里博士今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上，就「積極拓展香港新經濟增長點」議員議案的開場發言：

代主席：

我感謝容海恩議員提出這項動議，亦感謝田北辰議員、陳曼琪議員和李浩然議員提出的修正案。

中共中央總書記、國家主席習近平於二○二五年三月五日全國兩會期間發表重要講話，提出要「守牢實體經濟這個根基，堅持推動傳統產業改造升級和開辟戰略性新興產業」。特區政府一直積極配合國家的戰略方向，把握香港在「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的優勢，在鞏固傳統優勢產業的同時，積極開拓新經濟增長點，提升香港的競爭力及國際影響力，充分扮演「超級聯繫人」與「超級增值人」的角色。今日討論的議案與政府的政策方向不謀而合，在此方向下具體工作該如何部署？

首先，我們要做好深化國際交往合作這方面的工作。香港會繼續發揮內聯外通的獨特優勢，連接內地及全球市場，同時進一步拓展「全球南方」新興市場。除了恆常的資助計劃和支援措施，政府一直努力招商引資，並為港商創造有利條件積極開拓新興市場。有關工作主要分為三方面：

第一，加強區域合作。政府正馬不停蹄地與東南亞國家聯盟、中東及「一帶一路」沿線地區展開經貿合作，包括香港於去年三月與巴林簽訂促進和保護投資協定（投資協定），而香港與卡塔爾已大致完成投資協定談判，並正與沙特阿拉伯、孟加拉國、埃及和秘魯探討簽訂投資協定。同時，我們會繼續積極聯繫《區域全面經濟伙伴關係協定》（RCEP）成員，透過不同平台及場合進行游說，爭取盡快加入RCEP，讓香港貢獻力量，促進區域經濟融合發展。

第二，建構高增值供應鏈。因應部分供應鏈正向「全球南方」及「一帶一路」沿線國家遷移，以及內地企業積極「走出去」的趨勢，投資推廣署和香港貿易發展局（貿發局）在去年十二月已建立高增值供應鏈服務機制，聯手吸引內地企業到香港建立管理離岸貿易和供應鏈的國際或區域總部，並為在港企業提供一站式專業諮詢服務，以協助它們「走出去」重新部署其環球供應鏈。該機制有助香港深化國際交往合作，同時有助開拓新經濟增長點。

第三，推進「一帶一路」建設。香港會繼續發揮作為「一帶一路」功能平台的角色。行政長官於今年五月率領50多位香港商貿代表和內地企業代表前往卡塔爾和科威特訪問，與中東地區進一步建立政府之間的關係、開拓合作領域擴大「朋友圈」。是次出訪成果相當理想，並達成了共59項合作備忘錄和協議合作，奠定多元基礎。

除了繼續努力深化與內地及國際市場的聯繫，政府亦會加強推動不同產業、不同領域的持續發展，包括創新科技、太空經濟、低空經濟、專業認證、清真產業、金融創新、綠色產業、文創產業及體育產業等方面。

在創新科技方面，政府以產業為導向，透過一系列措施推動香港創科發展及企業升級轉型，加快建設具有香港優勢的新實體經濟，並聚焦發展生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人，以及先進製造與新能源科技等具策略性意義的創科產業。

在太空經濟方面，國務院總理李強今年在《政府工作報告》提出了因地制宜發展新質生產力，開展新技術新產品新場景大規模應用示範行動，推進包括商業航天等的新產業。為配合國家發展新機遇，政府一直透過「創新及科技基金」支持各科技範疇的研究及發展，包括支援香港的大學和研發中心進行與航天相關的電子、數據處理和材料科學等範疇的研發。此外，政府已在InnoHK創新香港研發平台下成立香港太空機械人與能源中心。另外，為了讓業界更好把握低軌衞星作為全球衞星發展的新趨勢及當中的發展機遇，政府正進行簡化申請營辦低軌衞星牌照審批的研究工作，目標是在二○二五年內完成相關工作。

在低空經濟方面，財政司副司長領導的發展低空經濟工作組正以多管齊下的策略，全力構建智慧低空經濟生態圈。在應用層面上，我們透過推行「監管沙盒」試點項目，推動無人機技術在不同領域的突破性應用。法規方面，立法會剛於七月中通過有關擴大無人機規管範圍及開放載人飛行器試驗的法例修訂工作。工作組會繼續推進低空經濟基礎建設規劃及區域融合發展。

在清真產業方面，政府透過多方面提升香港在清真市場的競爭力。在吸引資金方面，政府已修訂法例，為發行伊斯蘭債券提供一個與傳統債券相若的稅務架構，並容許在政府債券計劃下發行伊斯蘭債券。至於貿易方面，貿發局一直就重點清真市場進行研究，為港商提供實用資訊。貿發局亦一直提供不同平台推動清真市場的商機，例如每年都在其美食商貿博覽推廣不同優質清真產品和食品，以及相關產品貿易，協助餐飲業拓展網絡和業務。另外，為推動旅遊業界提升穆斯林旅遊配套，香港旅遊發展局已積極與不同機構合作，透過提升穆斯林友善的旅遊設施；為酒店、景點和會議展覽場地進行相關評級；推動餐廳參與清真認證等，從而吸引更多穆斯林旅客訪港。

在專業認證服務方面，現時本地業界提供的專業認證服務已由電子電氣產品、建築材料等傳統產業拓展到環境、社會及管治、綠色金融等新興領域。政府一直和香港檢測和認證局緊密合作，透過多元化的線上線下宣傳和研討會等活動，協助業界針對性地推廣認證服務，發掘新商機。

在金融創新方面，為促進數字資產行業的可持續發展，繼政府在二○二三年六月實施數字資產交易平台發牌制度，《穩定幣條例》亦會於八月一日正式實施，為穩定幣發行人發牌訂下法定監管制度。政府亦正就其他數字資產活動規管範疇進行公眾諮詢，務求完善有關規管，助力市場健康發展。

在綠色產業方面，政府一直透過低碳綠色科研基金和「創新及科技基金」支援本地綠色科技發展，將具實際應用潛力的科研項目轉化為具商業價值的技術或產品，並在本地生產，長遠促進香港綠色產業發展。另外，香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融中心，正積極推動金融科技和綠色金融更好結合。其中，政府在「政府可持續債券計劃」下已成功發行合共約2,400億元等值的政府綠色債券，當中包括兩批代幣化綠色債券，分別是全球首批政府代幣化綠色債券及全球首批多貨幣計價數碼原生綠色債券，充分展示香港在結合債券市場、綠色和可持續金融，以及金融創新方面的優勢和領導地位。

在文化創意產業方面，政府正致力落實於去年十一月公布的《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，為經濟發展提供動力。其中一個發展方向是完善文藝創意產業生態圈，透過建立和拓展產業平台，促進跨界別和跨領域的合作。其中，政府以產業導向原則，培育具產業化潛質的文創項目，例如在剛完結的香港動漫電玩節中設立「香港國際潮玩博覽」、資助漫畫業界年度盛事「國際漫畫家大會」及「國際漫畫展」等，展現香港作為亞洲創意之都的地位，全方位支援產業化發展。

在體育產業方面，近年香港體育產業的規模正穩步擴展。根據二○二四年八月公布的資料，體育及相關活動在二○二二年以基本價格計算的增加價值約為380億元，較五年前增加11.8%。政府除了加強對精英運動員的支援和透過「M」品牌計劃吸引國際體育盛事在香港舉行，啟德體育園的落成為推動體育和周邊產業注入新動力，在推動本港體育全面發展的同時，帶動娛樂、演出及旅遊業等相關產業的發展，對促進體育產業化和推動經濟發揮積極作用。

結語

代主席，今日的議案涵蓋多個政策範疇，政府相關政策局和部門會通力合作，為有利經濟發展的範疇致力提供合適的政策和環境，我們亦非常歡迎議員的寶貴建議。接下來，我會細心聆聽各位議員的意見，稍後在總結發言時再詳細回應。代主席，我謹此陳辭。"
立法會：署理勞工及福利局局長就「完善灣區人才標準，促進區域人才流動」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 18:18,2025-07-30 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000683.htm,"以下是署理勞工及福利局（勞福局）局長何啟明今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議就「完善灣區人才標準，促進區域人才流動」議員議案的總結發言全文：

代主席：

我再次感謝顏汶羽議員提出這項議案，以及梁子穎議員提出的修正案。同時，我感謝在座議員就這項議題表逹的意見及提出的建議，我會在此簡略回應。

正如我在開場發言所說，特區政府一直採取多管齊下的策略，以培育本地人才為主，引入外來人才為輔，豐富香港的人才庫，增強香港發展動能，主動對接國家「十四五」規劃及粵港澳大灣區建設，加快融入國家發展大局。

大灣區內城市有不同的優勢和定位，在人才培養、招攬、交流等方面有廣闊的合作空間。為了共同建設粵港澳大灣區人才高地，很多政策局及部門一直就相關行業致力推動香港與其他大灣區城市的專業人才發展、便捷兩地專業人才資格互認及強化相關標準銜接的工作，包括律政司、發展局、教育局、環境及生態局、醫務衞生局、房屋局、財經事務及庫務局以及勞福局。各政策局及部門都非常重視和關心灣區內人才流動的情況，會與相關行業的業界人士及團體緊密聯繫，了解行業最新發展及人力需求情況，並與其他大灣區城市負責單位商議，從而制定及優化相關措施。

在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》（CEPA）的框架下，內地已在絕大部分的服務貿易領域對香港實施優惠和便利措施，包括放寬香港專業人士提供服務的資質要求、准許香港專業人士在內地參加考試、註冊、執業和開業，以及鼓勵雙方的專業機構進行資格互認。目前，多個服務領域已設立專業資格互認或專業資格考試的考卷豁免安排，包括建築及相關工程、證券及期貨、銀行和房地產。

在建築及相關工程服務方面，正如剛才盧偉國議員提到，發展局與內地相關部門合作，允許合資格的香港工程、建築、測量、規劃和園境五個專業範疇的企業和專業人士，無須通過資格互認，只要完成簡單的備案程序，對應內地相應的資格，便可以到大灣區內地九市直接提供服務。另一方面，發展局與廣東省及澳門合作，就建造技術工人及技術人員的技術水平建立灣區標準，並推展「一試多證」安排。未來，我們會持續優化所需配套措施，支持粵港澳三地在建造業人才培育方面的合作，助力整個大灣區的建造業邁向更高質量發展。

在金融服務領域，政府一直致力建立金融人才庫，為業界創造發展動能。在CEPA框架下，內地與香港已就不同金融服務業的專業及行業資格推出開放措施，有利於內地金融人才來港發展。除了我較早前提到有關證券、基金及期貨行業，以及銀行業的資格互認機制，在會計專業方面，香港會計師公會與中國註冊會計師協會亦設有會計專業考試科目豁免安排。

地產代理服務方面，兩地的規管機構可分別推薦合資格地產代理及房地產經紀人參加由對方專門開設的培訓課程及考試。在完成課程及通過考試後，相關人士可申請在對方管轄範圍從事相關行業的資格。

在環境保護方面，香港在環境法規、國際認證及專業管理方面具有優勢。環境保護署（環保署）一直與相關專業學會合作，為環保相關科目的畢業生及年青環境專業人士提供實習培訓。剛才盧偉國議員提到，亦感謝你的推進，環保署計劃聯同香港合資格環保專業人員學會，與內地探索建立環保專業人員認證的可行性，以促進香港與大灣區內地城市的交流和合作。

而在爭議解決服務方面，粵港澳三地法律部門亦將爭取在今年內推出大灣區仲裁員名冊，以推動粵港澳大灣區仲裁員的人才連接，構建大灣區內多元化爭議解決機制。

代主席，雖然剛剛提到我們進行了許多工作，但當然很多工作仍有待推進，包括陳祖恒議員提到實習簽證的問題、周文港議員提到的學歷互認問題、黃俊碩議員提到「開小門而關小門」的問題，以及謝偉銓議員提到單一窗口的問題均仍待解決。然而，有些議員提出的問題我們已處理，包括剛才洪雯議員提到是否可透過香港引進國際領軍人才，其實今早在立法會前廳交流會上，政務司司長亦提到我們已釐定領軍人才引進機制，若各位議員物色到世界上頂尖的行業領軍人才，歡迎告訴我們，我們會主動出擊，以期將他們引來香港。

另外，黃錦輝議員提到能否讓職專學校的學生畢業後直接來港服務，其實在現行的職專畢業生留港計劃下已有類似操作安排，我們希望有更多非本地技術專才可以來到香港就讀職業訓練局，然後在港就業及紮根。我們會繼續與內地相關機構發展並完善類似安排。

政府各政策局及部門會繼續因應各行業最新發展及人力需求情況，制定及優化相應的培訓策略和措施，提升相關行業人才的職業和專業技能。此外，職業訓練局及僱員再培訓局亦提供全面的職業專才教育及培訓服務，提升本地勞動力的整體競爭力。

優質的人才是發展的重要動能，也是世界各地爭相競逐的對象。大灣區內城市各有不同優勢和定位，香港會繼續與其他大灣區城市攜手引才、留才、育才、用才，對接國家「十四五」規劃及粵港澳大灣區建設，加快融入國家發展大局。特區政府感謝各位議員對這項議題的重視和關心，各政策局和部門會繼續與業界人士及團體保持緊密溝通，並與其他大灣區城市負責單位聯繫和商議，推動香港與其他大灣區城市的專業人才發展、便捷兩地專業人才資格互認及強化相關標準銜接的工作，促進區域人才流動。

多謝主席。"
立法會二十題：發展九龍城區海濱,2025-07-30 18:15,2025-07-30 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000624.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上李慧琼議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為隨着《2024年保護海港（修訂）條例草案》於本年五月獲本會通過，以及當局已邀請香港鐵路有限公司研究將紅磡站南面的臨海及前碼頭用地打造成設有遊艇會的海濱新地標，九龍城區海濱可望透過連接黃埔、土瓜灣和啟德等地區而得以貫通，而海濱區更可延伸至尖沙咀和觀塘海濱長廊，是政府建立「全民海濱」的重要契機。同時，由於啟德體育園落成及啟德跑道區持續發展，海濱區將吸引大量市民及遊客，周邊區域的交通配套及接駁設施的需求將大幅增加。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有何具體方案和時間表處理現時九龍城區海濱的斷點問題，包括翔龍灣煤氣調壓站、海心公園魚尾石一帶及青洲英泥碼頭私人地段；

（二）如何評估現時啟德區（尤其是跑道區）交通配套的不足之處；有何計劃改善該區的交通連接，包括水上交通和陸路接駁，以提升區域暢達性及應對大型盛事舉辦時的人流需求；

（三）如何解決舊區與海濱之間連接不足的問題；會否與市區重建局協調，在重建項目中加強行人系統網絡，以提升舊區與海濱的連接性；

（四）當局有何初步構思善用九龍城海濱水域資源；會否考慮發展水上活動設施，以配合啟德體育園及「青年驛站」旅舍的建設；及

（五）如何評估九龍城區的歷史文化資源與海濱發展的協同效應；有何計劃將該區內的歷史文化元素融入海濱發展？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直與海濱事務委員會緊密合作，推動各項優化維港海濱的工作，為公眾營造多元、活力、暢達和共融的海濱空間。就李議員關注的尖沙咀至啟德海濱發展而言，在長約15公里的可發展海濱長廊當中，目前已駁通將近七成，二○二八年年底將駁通近八成半。此外，我們會持續提升區內的海濱設施，例如於七月中開放紅磡都市公園（第二期），最近亦建議在發展紅磡站周邊和海濱一帶用地時，在紅磡繞道底臨海一段進行小規模填海工程，善用修訂的《保護海港條例》（第531章）的拆牆鬆綁機制興建新行人板道以連接尖沙咀海濱長廊與紅磡海濱長廊，以及優化海濱與內陸的行人連接，加強區域暢達性。

就提問各部分，經諮詢運輸及物流局、文化體育及旅遊局、民政及青年事務局和九龍城民政事務處後，現回覆如下：

（一）就李議員提及的三個地點，發展局目前有以下構思：

（i）海心公園內魚尾石一帶的海濱：魚尾石臨海一段是維港兩岸僅存的自然海岸線之一，我們認為應予以保留，現階段沒有計劃進行填海工程。現時魚尾石後方已設有行人通道連接海心公園擴建部分的海濱長廊，我們會繼續與康樂及文化事務署探討優化現有行人通道的方案及可行性，進一步改善魚尾石一帶海濱的通達性。

（ii）土瓜灣翔龍灣對開臨海煤氣設施用地：現時該臨海位置的煤氣調壓站及用作運送煤氣原材料石腦油的碼頭仍在運作中。我們與業權人一直保持溝通，探討在不影響上述設施的情況下開通一條行人通道的可能性。土木工程拓展署正就不同行人連接方案，進行定量風險評估，目標在今年內完成。

（iii）紅磡青洲英泥碼頭一帶海濱地段：所涉部分地段的業權已分散賣出，而且部分地段按地契享有進出航道的權利，因此要打通臨海地段存在較多複雜性，較另外兩個地點需要較長時間處理。政府會先探討以非填海的方案貫通該處一帶海濱，包括如業權人有意將用地作與海濱發展相符的用途，政府樂意共同探討可行方案，以期達致共贏的局面。然而，若最終證明這些非填海方案並不可行，我們會研究在該處興建涉及小規模填海工程的行人板道的可能性。

我們會繼續採用「先易後難」的處理方式，改善以上三個海濱地點的暢達性，並把它們納入我們將在短期內展開的「東九龍海濱長廊研究」，以研究進一步貫通相關海濱段落。

（二）運輸及物流局一直因應九龍城區海濱的整體規劃及項目落成進度，持續協調各公共交通營辦商提供服務。啟德發展區一帶現時已接駁至港鐵網絡，加上附近的主幹道和連接路（包括太子道東、承啟道、承豐道等）目前有超過50條巴士及專線小巴路線，方便區內居民往返港九新界各區。運輸署亦已計劃新增兩條專營巴士路線，由啟德郵輪碼頭開出，途經啟德跑道區，分別提供直達紅磡與尖沙咀的特快服務及前往宋皇臺站及啟德站的接駁服務。此外，運輸及物流局正全力推展啟德智慧綠色集體運輸系統，以連接啟德跑道區至啟德站。該局預計今年下半年為項目招標，以期在二○二六年批出合約。水路交通方面，現時「北角—觀塘—啟德」渡輪航線，於周末及公眾假期的航班會停靠啟德跑道區。

就應對於啟德體育園舉辦大型活動的人流需求上，運輸署會與啟德體育園、活動主辦單位及公共交通營運商等保持密切聯繫，在交通管理方面及早作出準備和部署。視乎活動的規模及觀眾的需要，政府及公共交通營運商會加強鐵路服務、開辦特別巴士服務（包括本地和跨境服務），以及協調加強的士服務。

（三）一直以來，發展局會與市區重建局（市建局）溝通和協調，為重建項目加強行人系統網絡，方便市民的日常生活，為社區帶來裨益。就土瓜灣方面，市建局於今年三月委聘顧問展開「土瓜灣海濱研究」，其中一個研究目的正是加強內陸與海濱空間連接，探討藉着市區更新項目改善舊區環境和道路網絡，加強土瓜灣舊區與海濱的連接性和暢達性。市建局預計顧問團隊將於下半年提交初期研究報告及可行性研究建議。我們會就如何加強內陸與海濱之間連接，與市建局協調合作。

（四）為了善用九龍城區及其附近地區的海濱資源，政府進行了不同工作。在發展水上活動設施方面，三個位於觀塘避風塘海濱用地的水上訓練中心已投入運作，近日有不同團體在該處附近水域舉辦各式各樣的本地及國際水上運動／康樂活動／訓練課程，善用該處水體，增添九龍東海旁的活力及吸引力。

在善用水體方面，發展局轄下的起動九龍東辦事處與海事處已共同制定《共享觀塘避風塘指引》，推廣船隻及水上康樂活動於非颱風日子安全共用避風塘。此外，海事處已於二○一八年將觀塘避風塘沿觀塘海濱花園的通航區由50米擴闊一倍至約100米，以䆁放更多空間作水上康樂活動。政府亦會繼續與相關持份者如體育總會及啟德「青年驛站」的營運團體保持緊密聯繫，以善用毗鄰的維港海濱和水體資源。

（五）由政務司副司長任組長的發展旅遊熱點工作組在今年五月公布九個旅遊熱點項目，當中包括「特色社區之香港龍城深度遊」。「深度遊」項目以《九龍城寨光影之旅》電影場景展為出發點，透過包裝並推介不同具特色的旅遊路線，延伸旅客在九龍城區內的體驗。九龍城區是多元文化與新舊共融的特色社區，九龍城民政事務處將善用區內的歷史文化資源，設計別具香港特色的深度旅遊體驗。旅遊路線將涵蓋不同的歷史文化主題，例如寨城歷史、泰潮文化、歷史古蹟以及啟德機場回憶等，吸引旅客和市民沿着主題路線探索不同景點，包括牛棚藝術村和海心公園等毗鄰海濱的歷史文化景點。隨着九龍城臨海用地陸續重建發展，包括香港房屋協會的資助房屋項目，以及毗鄰的市區重建項目，將提供更多優質公共空間予市民享用，我們會邀請有關發展單位積極考慮把九龍城區內歷史文化元素融入海濱的空間。"
LCQ20: Development of harbourfront of Kowloon City District,2025-07-30 18:15,2025-07-30 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000633.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Starry Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

There are views that as the Protection of the Harbour (Amendment) Bill 2024 was passed by this Council in May this year, and the authorities have invited the Mass Transit Railway Corporation Limited to conduct a study to develop the waterfront and former pier sites to the south of Hung Hom Station into a new harbourfront landmark with yacht club, it is hoped that the harbourfront of Kowloon City District can realise connectivity through linking up areas such as Whampoa, To Kwa Wan and Kai Tak, and that the harbourfront zone can even be extended to the harbourfront of Tsim Sha Tsui and Kwun Tong. This serves as an important opportunity for the Government to develop a ""Harbourfront for the People"". At the same time, given the completion of the Kai Tak Sports Park and the continuous development of the runway area of Kai Tak, the harbourfront zone will attract a large number of members of the public and tourists, and the demand for ancillary transport facilities and connection facilities in the surrounding areas will increase substantially. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the specific proposal and timetable for addressing the existing disconnection problem in the harbourfront of Kowloon City District, including the gas offtake station off Grand Waterfront, the vicinity of the Fishtail Rock in Hoi Sham Park, and the private section of the Green Island Cement Pier;

(2) how it evaluates the inadequacies of the existing ancillary transport facilities in Kai Tak area (especially the runway area); of the plans in place to improve transport connectivity in the area, including waterborne transport and land transport, so as to enhance the accessibility of the area and cope with the demand arising from pedestrian flow when mega events are taking place;

(3) how it will address inadequate connectivity between old districts and the harbourfront; whether it will coordinate with the Urban Renewal Authority to enhance the network of pedestrian systems in redevelopment projects, so as to enhance connectivity between old districts and the harbourfront;

(4) of the authorities' preliminary ideas on optimising the use of water resources at the harbourfront of Kowloon City; whether the development of water sports facilities will be considered for supporting the construction of the Kai Tak Sports Park and ""Youth Post"" hostel; and

(5) how it evaluates the synergy between the historical and cultural resources and harbourfront development in Kowloon City District; of the plans in place to incorporate the historical and cultural elements of the district into harbourfront development?

Reply:

President,

The Government has been working closely with the Harbourfront Commission to promote various initiatives to enhance the Victoria Harbourfront, with a view to creating a diversified, vibrant, accessible and inclusive harbourfront space for the public. Regarding the harbourfront development from Tsim Sha Tsui to Kai Tak that Dr the Hon Lee is concerned with, out of the developable promenade of approximately 15 kilometres, nearly 70 per cent has been connected so far, and around 85 per cent is expected to be connected by the end of 2028. In addition, we will continue to improve harbourfront facilities in the district, such as the opening of the Hung Hom Urban Park (Phase 2) in mid-July, as well as recent proposal to make good use of the streamlined mechanism under the amended Protection of the Harbour Ordinance (Cap. 531) to carry out small scale reclamation underneath the waterfront section of the Hung Hom Bypass when developing the sites around Hung Hom Station and waterfront areas, with a view to connecting the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront promenade with the Hung Hom waterfront promenade through construction of a new boardwalk, and also strengthening the pedestrian connectivity between the harbourfront and the inland areas for enhancing the accessibility across regions.

In consultation with the Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB), the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau and the Kowloon City District Office (KCDO), the reply to various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) Regarding the three locations mentioned by Dr the Hon Lee, the latest views of the Development Bureau (DEVB) are as follows:

(i) for the waterfront in the vicinity of the Fishtail Rock in Hoi Sham Park: We consider that being one of the only remaining natural shorelines along the Victoria Harbour, the waterfront section of Fishtail Rock should be retained and there are no plans for reclamation at this stage. Currently, there is a pedestrian connection behind the Fishtail Rock connecting to the promenade of the Hoi Sham Park Extension. We will continue to explore the options and feasibility for enhancing the existing pedestrian connection with the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, with a view to further improving the accessibility of the waterfront in the vicinity of the Fishtail Rock.

(ii) for the waterfront gas facility site off Grand Waterfront in To Kwa Wan: Currently, the gas offtake station and the jetty for transfer of naphtha, the raw material for production of gas, are still in operation. We have been liaising with the landowner to explore the possibility of providing a pathway at its lot under the condition that the operation of the above facilities would not be affected. The Civil Engineering and Development Department is conducting a quantitative risk assessment on various pedestrian connection options, with a target of completion within this year.

(iii) for the waterfront area near the Green Island Cement Pier in Hung Hom: Connecting the concerned waterfront area is more complex and requires more time to tackle than the other two locations due to the fact that the lots therein are under multiple ownership with various owners, and certain parts of these lots have access to the sea according to the relevant leases. The Government would at the moment explore non-reclamation options to connect the harbourfront area, including the case where the concerned owners intend to use the site for a purpose consistent with the harbourfront development, the Government is willing to explore feasible solutions collaboratively with a view to achieving a win-win situation. However, should the non-reclamation options be proven not feasible in the end, we will study the possibility of a boardwalk with small scale reclamation.

We will continue to adopt the approach of ""tackling the simple issues first before the difficult ones"" to improve accessibility of the three waterfront locations above, and will incorporate them into the Study on East Kowloon Harbourfront Trail to be commenced in the near future, to examine further connecting the relevant harbourfront sections.

(2) The TLB has been co-ordinating with various public transport operators to provide services in line with the overall planning and progress of the completion of the various projects along the Kowloon City harbourftont. The Kai Tak Development Area (KTDA) is now connected to the MTR network, and together with the main roads and connecting roads in its vicinity (including Prince Edward Road East, Shing Kai Road, Shing Fung Road, etc.) are currently served by over 50 franchised bus and green minibus (GMB) routes, making it convenient for residents to travel to and from different districts on the Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories. The Transport Department (TD) has also planned to introduce two new franchised bus routes, which will provide express service from the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal via the Kai Tak Runway Area (KTRA) to Hung Hom/Tsim Sha Tsui direct and connecting service to Sung Wong Toi Station and Kai Tak Station respectively. In addition, the TLB is implementing the Smart and Green Mass Transit System in Kai Tak (the Project) in full swing for connecting the KTRA to the Kai Tak Station. It is targeted to invite tender for the Project in the second half of 2025 for awarding the contract in 2026. In terms of water transport, currently the ""North Point–Kwun Tong–Kai Tak"" ferry route calls at the KTRA on weekends and public holidays.

To cope with the demand arising from pedestrian flow when mega events are taking place in the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP), the TD will maintain close communication with the KTSP, event organisers and public transport operators to make advance preparations and arrangements in terms of transportation management. Depending on the scale of events and the needs of the spectators, the Government and public transport operators will strengthen rail services, introduce special bus services (including local and cross-boundary services) and co-ordinate enhanced taxi services.

(3) The DEVB and the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) have all along been maintaining close communication and co-ordination to strengthen the pedestrian network in redevelopment projects, facilitating citizens' daily lives and benefiting the community. Regarding To Kwa Wan, the URA commissioned consultants in March this year to launch the To Kwa Wan Harbourfront Study. One of the study's objectives is to strengthen the connection between the inland area and the harbourfront, explore measures to improve the environment of old district and the road network through urban renewal projects, thereby enhancing the connectivity and accessibility between the To Kwa Wan old district and the harbourfront. The URA expected the consultant team to submit a preliminary study report and feasibility study proposals in the second half of this year. We will co-ordinate and join forces with the URA on exploring ways to enhance connectivity between inland areas and the waterfront.

(4) The Government has undertaken various initiatives to leverage harbourfront resources in the Kowloon City District and its adjacent areas. Regarding the development of water sports facilities, three water sports training centres at waterfront sites around the Kwun Tong Typhoon Shelter (KTTS) have come into operation. Recently, different organisations have organised a variety of local and international water sports/recreational activities/training courses at the water bodies near KTTS, effectively utilising the water bodies and enhancing the vibrancy and attractiveness of the Kowloon East waterfront.

In respect of making good use of the water bodies, the Energizing Kowloon East Office under the DEVB and the Marine Department have jointly promulgated the Guidelines for Co-using KTTS to promote water body co-use between vessels and water recreational activities in the KTTS during non-typhoon days. Besides, the Marine Department has widened the passageway in KTTS along Kwun Tong Promenade from 50 m to about 100 m in 2018 to allow more space for water recreational activities. The Government will continue to maintain close communication with relevant stakeholders, such as sports associations and the operator of the ""Youth Post"" in Kai Tak, to optimise the use of the adjacent Victoria Harbourfront and water resources.

(5) The Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, led by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, announced nine tourist hotspot projects in May 2025, among which is ""Featured community - In-depth travel in Kowloon City"". Taking the ""Kowloon Walled City: A Cinematic Journey"" Movie Set Exhibition as the starting point, this project curates and promotes several unique travel routes to enhance tourists' experience in Kowloon City District. Kowloon City District is a distinctive neighbourhood with multicultural background and the blend of old and new elements. The KCDO will leverage the historic and cultural resources in the district to design in-depth travel experiences that showcase the unique character of Hong Kong. These travel routes will feature various historical and cultural themes, such as the history of the Kowloon Walled City, Thai and Chiu Chow cultures, historic sites and the legacy of Kai Tak airport, and will encourage both tourists and the public to explore different attractions along the thematic routes, such as the Cattle Depot Artist Village and Hoi Sham Park, along with other historic and cultural attractions adjacent to the harbourfront. With the progressive redevelopment of waterfront sites in Kowloon City, including the subsidised housing projects of the Hong Kong Housing Society and the urban renewal initiatives nearby, more quality public spaces will be provided for public enjoyment. We will invite the relevant development bodies to actively consider incorporating the historical and cultural elements of the Kowloon City District into the harbourfront spaces."
立法會內務委員會主席於研究政策事宜小組委員會傳媒簡報會上的發言全文（只有中文）,2025-07-30 18:12,2025-07-30 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000684.htm,"下稿代立法會秘書處發出：

以下是立法會內務委員會主席李慧琼今日（七月三十日）於研究政策事宜小組委員會傳媒簡報會上的開場發言全文︰

今日簡報會的目的，是向大家介紹立法會政策事宜小組委員會的工作。在我身旁的是在今個會期完成工作的九個政策事宜小組委員會的主席或委員。

作為香港特別行政區管治團隊的重要組成部分，以及改革的參與者和推動者，立法會一直積極就不同政策範疇向官員建言獻策，並在每個會期就備受關注的社會議題進行研究，成立政策（事宜）小組（委員會）的目的，就是要進一步研究。

在第七屆立法會，內務委員會（內會）及各事務委員會轄下一共成立了26個政策事宜小組委員會，就多項重要課題進行研究。當中包括「促進粵港澳大灣區發展」、「推動國民及國安教育」、「北部都會區發展」、 「發展智慧城市」、「人口政策和措施」，以及「工務工程效益成本」等。政策事宜小組委員會除了與政府當局進行討論和收集公眾意見外，亦會聯同相關政策局進行考察，並參考立法會秘書處（秘書處）就其他地方的經驗所進行的資料研究，全方位檢視和研究有關政策範疇的現行政策措施，並提出具體建議，推動政府當局制訂和落實有利香港實現高質量發展、貼近市民大眾期望和切合社會需要的政策措施。

政策事宜小組委員會完成工作後，會向內會或所屬事務委員會提交報告，有關報告亦會提交相關政策局考慮。今個會期，我提出與政府當局舉行跟進會議，讓九個在今個會期完成工作的小組委員會的主席及副主席，就報告的重點建議與相關政策局局長聚焦交換意見。我很高興各政策局對小組委員會的工作都予以肯定，並表示會高度重視及積極研究相關建議。這樣的安排充分體現了行政立法之間的良性互動，齊心為香港特別行政區「由治及興」這一個新階段發展而出力。我期望行政長官在九月發表的《施政報告》中，會吸納小組委員會的意見。

我亦藉此機會，感謝各小組委員會成員、秘書處的辛勤工作，各個政策局的積極配合，以及所有同事所提供的專業協助。"
立法會十四題：協助青年置業的措施,2025-07-30 18:05,2025-07-30 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000554.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上梁毓偉議員的提問和政務司副司長兼任房屋局局長卓永興的書面答覆：

問題：

本屆政府近年積極鼓勵青年在房屋階梯向上流動，並採取多項措施協助青年置業。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）在「白表居屋第二市場計劃2024」（「白居二2024」）的申請者中，「青年計劃（白居二）」的青年申請者的人數及其所佔百分比為何，並按年齡組別（即18歲至29歲及30歲至39歲）列出分項資料；

（二）「白居二2024」的6 000個名額中，最終編配予40歲以下申請者的數目為何；當局會否因應該計劃的反應和青年的置業需求，進一步增加青年計劃（白居二）的名額；

（三）有否統計過去五年，每年按揭保險計劃（按保計劃）下的八成及九成按揭貸款的申請數目，以及該等數目佔每年新批出按揭貸款個案總數的百分比分別為何；八成及九成按揭貸款的申請者中，有多少人屬40歲以下青年；

（四）鑑於去年八月香港按證保險有限公司（按保公司）宣布一項新安排，合資格業主（例如業主家庭將有新生嬰兒而導致住屋要求改變）可獲豁免按保計劃下的業主自住要求並將物業出租，政府是否知悉按保公司會否考慮優化有關措施（例如將受惠資格由新生嬰兒家庭擴展至涵蓋有年幼子女家庭），從而使更多青年家庭可按家庭需要轉換居所；

（五）據悉部分以往利用按保計劃申請高成數按揭置業的青年家庭，因樓價調整而難以換樓，甚至出現負資產，影響其人生規劃，政府有否調研、統計及監察有關情況對青年家庭的影響，並適時作出措施防止問題惡化；及

（六）會否在資助房屋政策方面進一步協助青年置業，例如調整資助房屋供應比例、將青年計劃擴展至香港房屋協會的資助房屋，以及增加每年資助房屋可供申請次數及大單位的供應比例等，從而使資助房屋成為青年首次置業的重要渠道？

答覆:

主席：

本屆政府自上任以來，積極推展多項針對公營房屋供應「提速、提量、提效、提質」的措施。在我們不懈努力下，公營房屋供應已扭轉了「頭輕尾重」的情況。連同30000個「簡約公屋」單位在內，未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），總體公營房屋供應量將達197000伙，較本屆政府上任時的五年期（即二○二二／二三至二○二六／二七年度），大幅增加超過85%，為市民安居樂業提供堅實的基礎。香港房屋委員會（房委會）亦一直致力完善房屋階梯，透過出售資助單位協助中低收入家庭自置居所，鼓勵他們按自己的能力選擇合適的房屋階梯上流。

我們留意到不少青年人均努力工作，透過累積經驗及儲蓄，向上流動。在各類資助出售單位的買家中，40歲以下的青年人一直佔大多數。舉例而言，成功購買一手居者有其屋計劃（居屋）單位的申請者有近一半是40歲以下；約80%的「白表居屋第二市場計劃」（白居二）申請者及買家亦是40歲以下的青年人。事實上，資助出售單位的售價亦屬青年可負擔。以「居屋2024」為例，經以負擔能力基準計算後，單位是以相當於市價的七折發售。按平均售價計算，一個實用面積約380呎單位的售價只是約270萬元。由於房委會為購買資助出售單位的人士提供按揭貸款保證，一般而言白表買家可以取得單位售價九成的按揭貸款。以上述380呎的單位為例，假設利息為3.5%和按揭還款期為30年，青年只需付出約27萬元首期和每月供款10,900元，便可成為業主。

為進一步協助青年人，房委會推出了一系列助力置業的措施。首先，由下一期居屋銷售計劃開始，房委會會為40歲以下的白表青年家庭及一人申請者分派多一個抽籤號碼；而在第二市場方面，房委會亦已由「白居二2024」起，增加1500個配額至6000個，並將新增配額全數撥予40歲以下的青年家庭及一人申請者。

與此同時，香港房屋協會（房協）作為政府在房屋政策方面的緊密合作伙伴，亦全力支持政府在協助青年置業的相關房屋政策措施，包括為申請購買資助出售房屋的40歲以下白表青年家庭及一人申請者分派多一個抽籤號碼。房協將繼續參考房委會的相關安排，並積極配合。

另外，政府亦透過「港人首次置業」（「首置」）項目，協助既不符合申請居屋資格、又未能負擔私營房屋的較高收入人士，達到他們的置業期望。除了市區重建局首兩個已推售的「首置」項目（即「煥然懿居」第一和第二座，以及「煥然懿居」第三座）共售出超過600個「首置」單位，政府正推展另外數個「首置」項目，於未來數年起合共提供約5000個「首置」單位。而過去所推售「首置」單位的申請人以及最終買家，有大約85%是40歲或以下青年。

除了提供不同類型的資助房屋外，政府亦推行了其他措施協助市民置業。本屆政府自二○二四年二月起撤銷所有住宅物業需求管理措施；香港金融管理局亦自二○二四年十月起修訂了物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，將最高物業按揭成數和「供款與入息比率」上限回復至二○○九年開始實施逆周期措施以前的水平——即不論物業價值，按揭成數上限一律調整至70%，供款與入息比率上限一律調整為50%——以便利不同置業需要的人士。個別人士更可按自身需要，透過按揭保險計劃（按保計劃）借取高成數的按揭貸款，其中有固定收入的首次置業人士購置價格1,000萬元或以下的物業，按揭成數可高達90%，大大減輕首期負擔。同時，政府自二○二五年二月二十六日起調整買賣或轉讓住宅及非住宅物業須繳付的從價印花稅的稅階，將徵收100元物業印花稅適用的物業價值上限由300萬元提高至400萬元，全方位協助有意置業的市民及青年。就資助出售單位而言，由於絕大部分單位的定價均低於400萬元（以「居屋2024」為例，單位平均售價為270萬元），買家已能受惠於上述印花稅降至100元的措施，最多可以節省近60,000元。

就梁毓偉議員的提問，經諮詢財經事務及庫務局，我們現回覆如下：

（一）在「白居二2024」申請期內，房委會共收到約34000份申請，超額申請約為五倍，顯示市民對二手資助出售單位的需求持續殷切。所有申請中，超過80%為選擇參加今期新推出「青年計劃（白居二）」的青年申請者，反映計劃相當受青年申請者歡迎。有關於「白居二2024」選擇參加「青年計劃（白居二）」的青年申請者數目及年齡分布，詳見附件一。

（二）「白居二2024」已於2025年4月攪珠，房委會預計會於二○二五年第三／四季向成功申請者發出批准信。批准信持有人可在指定日期內申請「購買資格證明書」（有效期12個月），以便購買未補價的資助出售單位。房委會會持續檢視配額使用情況、資助出售單位的需求，以及整體市場情況等因素，適時調整整體配額數量及「青年計劃（白居二）」名額。

（三）按保計劃由香港按證保險有限公司﹙按證保險公司）經營，以協助市民在香港安居置業。銀行在敍造住宅物業按揭貸款的時候，須遵守按揭成數上限的規定，而現時的按揭成數上限為70%。按保計劃則為銀行提供按揭保險，使銀行可以提供較高成數（即70%以上）的按揭貸款而毋須承擔額外的風險。在按保計劃下，只要申請個案符合相關條件，銀行一般可以提供高達80%的按揭貸款；對於首次置業的固定受薪人士，按揭成數更可達到90%。置業人士的首期負擔因而可以大大減輕。

過去五年，每年按保計劃下新取用按揭貸款宗數（以按揭成數劃分），以及該等數目佔每年新取用按揭貸款個案總數的百分比（即括號內所述數字）載列於附件二。

在上述新取用按揭貸款當中，涉及至少一名40歲以下業主的宗數，以及該等數目佔每年新取用按揭貸款個案宗數（以按揭成數劃分）的百分比（即括號內所述數字）載列於附件三。

（四）按證保險公司於二○二四年八月在按保計劃下設立新安排，按個別情況考慮批准合資格業主將自住的物業出租，以協助他們應付因個人或家庭處境轉變帶來的特別需要（新安排）。新安排推行接近一年，運作暢順，為有特別需要的業主提供實質協助。在新安排下，除了業主家庭將有新生嬰兒／領養兒童或業主失業的情況，業主如有其他特別需要而本身在相關物業已自住最少12個月，亦可透過銀行向按證保險公司申請將自住物業出租。現行機制已容許有年幼子女並滿足自住要求的業主，就其特別需要提出將自住物業出租的申請。按證保險公司會按個別情況考慮批准相關個案。

（五）按保計劃的目的是協助市民置業安居，為他們提供多一個財務安排選擇。物業市場的波動受許多不同因素影響，市民須因應自己置業的需要及還款能力作出考慮，小心評估風險。

（六）如上述所言，房委會及房協不遺餘力地優化各項安排，以協助有置業夢想的年輕人奮力向上，踏上置業階梯。行政長官已在二○二四年《施政報告》公布，房委會會調整公共租住房屋（公屋）（包括綠表置居計劃單位）和資助出售單位的比例，由七比三逐步調整至六比四，增加資助出售單位的供應。在未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），房委會和房協將共有約56500個資助出售單位落成。與此同時，房委會正落實二○二二年《施政報告》中有關新建單位面積「封底」的安排，即所有於二○二六／二七年度起落成的資助出售單位一般實用面積不會少於26平方米。此外，在未來十年期的較後時間，公營房屋的單位會預留10%的面積增長。我們亦正研究其他進一步協助青年購買資助房屋的措施，並會適時推出。然而，我們希望藉此機會再次呼籲年青人，應發揮潛力創造更豐盛的未來；萬勿為了符合申請公屋資格而限制自身的發展空間。過去五年（即二○二○／二一至二○二四／二五年度），獲編配公屋單位的非長者一人申請者平均年齡為57歲。青年人在了解上述政府為青年人提供的機會及支援後，應及早規劃以在房屋階梯攀得更高。"
LCQ14: Measures to assist young people in home ownership,2025-07-30 18:05,2025-07-30 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000565.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Leung and a written reply by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, who is undertaking the duties of the Secretary for Housing, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

 In recent years, the current-term Government has actively encouraged young people to move up the housing ladder and has put in place a number of measures to assist young people in home ownership. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) among the applicants for the White Form Secondary Market Scheme 2024 (WSM 2024), of the number of young applicants under the Youth Scheme (WSM) and their percentage, with a breakdown by age group (i.e. aged 18 to 29 and aged 30 to 39);

(2) out of the 6 000 quota under WSM 2024, of the number of those ultimately allocated to applicants aged under 40; whether the authorities will further increase the quota for the Youth Scheme (WSM) in the light of the response received and the demand of young people for home ownership;

(3) whether it has compiled statistics on the respective numbers of applications for 80 per cent and 90 per cent loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage loans under the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) in each of the past five years, and the respective percentages of such numbers in the total number of new mortgage loans approved each year; among the applicants for 80 per cent and 90 per cent LTV mortgage loans, of the number of young applicants aged under 40;

(4) given that the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) announced in August last year a new arrangement, in which a waiver of the owner occupancy requirement under MIP will be granted to an eligible homeowner (such as a homeowner's family expecting newborn(s), resulting in a change in housing needs) for renting out the property, whether the Government knows if HKMCI will consider enhancing such measure (such as expanding the eligibility criteria from families with newborn(s) to include families with young child or children as well), thereby enabling more young families to change residence based on family needs;

(5) as it is learnt that some young families who previously acquired mortgage loans with a high LTV ratio through MIP find it difficult to replace their properties due to property price adjustments, and some even find themselves in negative equity, thus affecting their life planning, whether the Government has conducted surveys and studies, compiled statistics, and monitored on how such situation has impacted young families, and taken timely measures to prevent the problem from worsening; and

(6) whether it will further assist young people in home ownership under the subsidised housing policies, such as adjusting the proportion of subsidised housing supply, extending the Youth Scheme to subsidised housing provided by the Hong Kong Housing Society, and increasing the annual number of applications that can be made for subsidised housing and the proportion of larger flats available, thereby making subsidised housing an important channel for young people to purchase their first home?

Reply:

President,

 Since taking office, the current-term Government has actively implemented multiple measures to ""enhance speed, quantity, efficiency and quality"" in public housing supply. With our unremitting efforts, the problem of back-loaded public housing supply has completely turned around. Coupled with 30 000 Light Public Housing units, the total public housing supply in the coming five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30) will reach 197 000 units, which is 85 per cent higher than that of the first five year period since the current-term Government took office (i.e. 2022-23 to 2026-27), providing a solid foundation for citizens to live and work in contentment. The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has also been striving to enhance the housing ladder by assisting low- to middle-income families to purchase their own homes through the sale of subsidised sale flats (SSF), and encouraging them to move up the housing ladder as appropriate according to their own affordability.

 We notice that many young people are working hard to achieve upward mobility through accumulation of experience and savings. Among buyers of various types of SSF, young people under the age of 40 have always been the majority. For instance, nearly half of the successful applicants for first-hand Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats are under the age of 40. Around 80 per cent of applicants and buyers under the White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) are also young people under the age of 40. In fact, the selling prices of SSF are affordable for young people. Taking HOS 2024 as an example, after applying the affordability benchmarks calculation, the flats are sold at around 70 per cent of the market price. Based on the average selling price, a flat of about 380 square feet in saleable area costs only around $2.7 million. As the HA provides a mortgage default guarantee for buyers of SSF, generally, White Form buyers can secure a mortgage loan at 90 per cent of the flat price. Assuming an interest rate at 3.5 per cent and a 30-year mortgage term, young people would only need to make a down payment of about $270,000, with monthly mortgage payments of $10,900, to become homeowners.

 To further assist young people, the HA has introduced a series of measures to facilitate their flat purchase. First, starting from the next HOS sale exercise, the HA will allocate an extra ballot number to young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 with White Form status. As for the secondary market, starting from WSM 2024, the HA has increased the quota to 6 000 by 1 500, all of which will be allocated to young family and one-person applicants under the age of 40.

 Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS), as a close partner of the Government in housing policies, also fully supports the Government's relevant housing initiatives in helping young people realise their home ownership aspirations, including the allocation of an additional ballot number to White Form young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 for the purchase of SSF. The HKHS will continue to make reference to the relevant arrangements of the HA and actively work towards the same.

 In addition, the Government also assists those higher-income persons who are not eligible for HOS and yet cannot afford private housing to achieve their home ownership aspirations through Starter Homes for Hong Kong Residents (SH) projects. Apart from the first two SH projects offered for sale by the Urban Renewal Authority (i.e. eResidence Towers 1 and 2, as well as eResidence Tower 3) with a total of over 600 SH units sold, the Government is also taking forward a few other SH projects, which will provide a total of around 5 000 SH units from the next few years onwards. Amongst applicants and final purchasers of SH units offered for sale in the past, around 85 per cent were youth aged 40 or below.

 Besides providing various types of subsidised housing, the Government has also implemented other measures to assist citizens in home purchase. The current-term Government has since February 2024 abolished all demand-side management measures for residential properties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also since October 2024 adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans. The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit were reverted to the pre-2009 levels before the countercyclical macroprudential measures were first introduced, with the maximum LTV ratio for all residential properties adjusted to 70 per cent, regardless of the value of the property, and the DSR limit adjusted to 50 per cent, providing facilitation to persons with different needs for property purchase. Individuals may also obtain high LTV ratio mortgage loans through the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) according to their own needs. In particular, for first-time homebuyers with regular income purchasing properties priced at $10 million or below, the LTV ratio can be up to 90 per cent, which greatly reduces their down payment burden. Meanwhile, to provide comprehensive support for citizens and young people who have aspirations in purchasing flats, the Government has since February 26, 2025 adjusted the value bands of Ad Valorem Stamp Duty payable for sale and purchase or transfer of residential and non-residential properties, raising the maximum value of properties chargeable to $100 stamp duty from $3 million to $4 million. As for SSF, since most units are priced below $4 million (taking HOS 2024 as an example, the average selling price is around $2.7 million), buyers may thus benefit from the aforementioned reduction in stamp duty to $100, with savings to nearly $60,000.

 In consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, our reply to the questions raised by the Hon Kenneth Leung is as follows:

(1) During the application period of WSM 2024, the HA received a total of around 34 000 applications. The oversubscription rate is about five times, reflecting the persistent strong demand for second hand SSF of citizens. Among all of the applications received, over 80 per cent came from young applicants opting to join the newly implemented Youth Scheme (WSM), showing that the scheme was well received by the young applicants. Regarding the number and age distribution of young applicants who opted for the Youth Scheme (WSM) under WSM 2024, please refer to Annex 1.

(2) Balloting for WSM 2024 was conducted in April 2025. The HA expects that approval letters will be issued to successful applicants in the third/fourth quarter of 2025. Within the specified period, holders of the approval letters may apply for Certificate of Eligibility to Purchase (valid for 12 months) to purchase a SSF with premium unpaid. The HA will continuously monitor factors including the quota utilisation, demand for SSF, overall market conditions, etc, to make timely adjustments to both the total number of quota and the allocations under the Youth Scheme (WSM).

(3) The MIP is administered by the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) for promoting home ownership in Hong Kong. When approving residential mortgage loans, banks have to comply with LTV requirement on owner-occupied residential mortgage lending, which is currently set at 70 per cent. With the MIP providing mortgage insurance to banks, banks can provide mortgage loans with higher LTV ratio (i.e. above 70 per cent) without incurring additional credit risk. As long as an application meets the relevant eligibility criteria, the bank can generally provide a mortgage loan of up to 80 per cent LTV ratio under the MIP. For first-time homebuyers with fixed salaries, the maximum LTV ratio can even reach 90 per cent, substantially reducing the down payment burden for homebuyers.

 The numbers of new loans drawn down under the MIP in the past five years (categorised by LTV ratio), and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 2.

 Among above new loans drawn down, the numbers of cases involving at least one homeowner aged below 40, and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (categorised by LTV ratio) (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 3.

(4) In August 2024, the HKMCI put in place a new arrangement under the MIP to approve on a case-by-case basis eligible homeowners' applications for renting out their self-occupied properties, so as to help them meet their special needs arising from changes in personal or family circumstances (new arrangement). The new arrangement has been implemented for around one year smoothly, offering substantial assistance to homeowners with special needs. Under the new arrangement, in addition to the situation that the homeowner's family is expecting newborn(s)/adopting child or children or the homeowner has become unemployed, any homeowner who has other special needs and has been residing in the relevant property for not less than 12 months may also submit an application to the HKMCI through a bank for renting out the self-occupied property. The existing mechanism already allows homeowners who have young children and are able to meet the self-occupancy requirement to submit applications for renting out their self-occupied properties based on their special needs. The HKMCI will consider approving the relevant applications on a case-by-case basis.

(5) The objective of the MIP is to promote home ownership and provide citizens with an additional option for financing. As the fluctuation of the property market is subject to various factors, citizens should take into consideration their needs for home ownership and repayment capability, and assess the risks carefully.

(6) As mentioned above, both the HA and the HKHS are making relentless efforts to optimise various arrangements to help young people with home ownership aspirations strive to climb onto the home ownership ladder. The Chief Executive announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the HA would adjust the ratio between public rental housing (PRH) (including Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme flats) and SSF from 7:3 to 6:4 in order to increase the supply of SSF. In the next five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30), the HA and the HKHS will complete about 56 500 SSF. Meanwhile, the HA is implementing the arrangement announced in the 2022 Policy Address regarding the minimum floor area for new flats. The saleable area of all SSF completed from 2026-27 onwards will be no less than 26 square metres in general. Furthermore, in the latter part of the coming decade, we will reserve 10 per cent increase in floor area for public housing. We are also exploring other measures to further assist young people in purchasing SSF and the measures will be launched in a timely manner. That said, we would like to take this opportunity to appeal to young people once again to unleash their potential and create a more prosperous future, but not to limit their room for development just for the sake of meeting the eligibility criteria for PRH application. In the past five years (i.e. 2020-21 to 2024-25), the average age of non-elderly one-person applicants that were housed to PRH was 57 years old. After understanding the above opportunities and support provided by the Government for young people, young people should plan ahead of time so as to climb higher up the housing ladder."

Reply:

President,

 Since taking office, the current-term Government has actively implemented multiple measures to ""enhance speed, quantity, efficiency and quality"" in public housing supply. With our unremitting efforts, the problem of back-loaded public housing supply has completely turned around. Coupled with 30 000 Light Public Housing units, the total public housing supply in the coming five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30) will reach 197 000 units, which is 85 per cent higher than that of the first five year period since the current-term Government took office (i.e. 2022-23 to 2026-27), providing a solid foundation for citizens to live and work in contentment. The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has also been striving to enhance the housing ladder by assisting low- to middle-income families to purchase their own homes through the sale of subsidised sale flats (SSF), and encouraging them to move up the housing ladder as appropriate according to their own affordability.

 We notice that many young people are working hard to achieve upward mobility through accumulation of experience and savings. Among buyers of various types of SSF, young people under the age of 40 have always been the majority. For instance, nearly half of the successful applicants for first-hand Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats are under the age of 40. Around 80 per cent of applicants and buyers under the White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) are also young people under the age of 40. In fact, the selling prices of SSF are affordable for young people. Taking HOS 2024 as an example, after applying the affordability benchmarks calculation, the flats are sold at around 70 per cent of the market price. Based on the average selling price, a flat of about 380 square feet in saleable area costs only around $2.7 million. As the HA provides a mortgage default guarantee for buyers of SSF, generally, White Form buyers can secure a mortgage loan at 90 per cent of the flat price. Assuming an interest rate at 3.5 per cent and a 30-year mortgage term, young people would only need to make a down payment of about $270,000, with monthly mortgage payments of $10,900, to become homeowners.

 To further assist young people, the HA has introduced a series of measures to facilitate their flat purchase. First, starting from the next HOS sale exercise, the HA will allocate an extra ballot number to young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 with White Form status. As for the secondary market, starting from WSM 2024, the HA has increased the quota to 6 000 by 1 500, all of which will be allocated to young family and one-person applicants under the age of 40.

 Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS), as a close partner of the Government in housing policies, also fully supports the Government's relevant housing initiatives in helping young people realise their home ownership aspirations, including the allocation of an additional ballot number to White Form young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 for the purchase of SSF. The HKHS will continue to make reference to the relevant arrangements of the HA and actively work towards the same.

 In addition, the Government also assists those higher-income persons who are not eligible for HOS and yet cannot afford private housing to achieve their home ownership aspirations through Starter Homes for Hong Kong Residents (SH) projects. Apart from the first two SH projects offered for sale by the Urban Renewal Authority (i.e. eResidence Towers 1 and 2, as well as eResidence Tower 3) with a total of over 600 SH units sold, the Government is also taking forward a few other SH projects, which will provide a total of around 5 000 SH units from the next few years onwards. Amongst applicants and final purchasers of SH units offered for sale in the past, around 85 per cent were youth aged 40 or below.

 Besides providing various types of subsidised housing, the Government has also implemented other measures to assist citizens in home purchase. The current-term Government has since February 2024 abolished all demand-side management measures for residential properties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also since October 2024 adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans. The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit were reverted to the pre-2009 levels before the countercyclical macroprudential measures were first introduced, with the maximum LTV ratio for all residential properties adjusted to 70 per cent, regardless of the value of the property, and the DSR limit adjusted to 50 per cent, providing facilitation to persons with different needs for property purchase. Individuals may also obtain high LTV ratio mortgage loans through the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) according to their own needs. In particular, for first-time homebuyers with regular income purchasing properties priced at $10 million or below, the LTV ratio can be up to 90 per cent, which greatly reduces their down payment burden. Meanwhile, to provide comprehensive support for citizens and young people who have aspirations in purchasing flats, the Government has since February 26, 2025 adjusted the value bands of Ad Valorem Stamp Duty payable for sale and purchase or transfer of residential and non-residential properties, raising the maximum value of properties chargeable to $100 stamp duty from $3 million to $4 million. As for SSF, since most units are priced below $4 million (taking HOS 2024 as an example, the average selling price is around $2.7 million), buyers may thus benefit from the aforementioned reduction in stamp duty to $100, with savings to nearly $60,000.

 In consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, our reply to the questions raised by the Hon Kenneth Leung is as follows:

(1) During the application period of WSM 2024, the HA received a total of around 34 000 applications. The oversubscription rate is about five times, reflecting the persistent strong demand for second hand SSF of citizens. Among all of the applications received, over 80 per cent came from young applicants opting to join the newly implemented Youth Scheme (WSM), showing that the scheme was well received by the young applicants. Regarding the number and age distribution of young applicants who opted for the Youth Scheme (WSM) under WSM 2024, please refer to Annex 1.

(2) Balloting for WSM 2024 was conducted in April 2025. The HA expects that approval letters will be issued to successful applicants in the third/fourth quarter of 2025. Within the specified period, holders of the approval letters may apply for Certificate of Eligibility to Purchase (valid for 12 months) to purchase a SSF with premium unpaid. The HA will continuously monitor factors including the quota utilisation, demand for SSF, overall market conditions, etc, to make timely adjustments to both the total number of quota and the allocations under the Youth Scheme (WSM).

(3) The MIP is administered by the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) for promoting home ownership in Hong Kong. When approving residential mortgage loans, banks have to comply with LTV requirement on owner-occupied residential mortgage lending, which is currently set at 70 per cent. With the MIP providing mortgage insurance to banks, banks can provide mortgage loans with higher LTV ratio (i.e. above 70 per cent) without incurring additional credit risk. As long as an application meets the relevant eligibility criteria, the bank can generally provide a mortgage loan of up to 80 per cent LTV ratio under the MIP. For first-time homebuyers with fixed salaries, the maximum LTV ratio can even reach 90 per cent, substantially reducing the down payment burden for homebuyers.

 The numbers of new loans drawn down under the MIP in the past five years (categorised by LTV ratio), and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 2.

 Among above new loans drawn down, the numbers of cases involving at least one homeowner aged below 40, and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (categorised by LTV ratio) (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 3.

(4) In August 2024, the HKMCI put in place a new arrangement under the MIP to approve on a case-by-case basis eligible homeowners' applications for renting out their self-occupied properties, so as to help them meet their special needs arising from changes in personal or family circumstances (new arrangement). The new arrangement has been implemented for around one year smoothly, offering substantial assistance to homeowners with special needs. Under the new arrangement, in addition to the situation that the homeowner's family is expecting newborn(s)/adopting child or children or the homeowner has become unemployed, any homeowner who has other special needs and has been residing in the relevant property for not less than 12 months may also submit an application to the HKMCI through a bank for renting out the self-occupied property. The existing mechanism already allows homeowners who have young children and are able to meet the self-occupancy requirement to submit applications for renting out their self-occupied properties based on their special needs. The HKMCI will consider approving the relevant applications on a case-by-case basis.

(5) The objective of the MIP is to promote home ownership and provide citizens with an additional option for financing. As the fluctuation of the property market is subject to various factors, citizens should take into consideration their needs for home ownership and repayment capability, and assess the risks carefully.

(6) As mentioned above, both the HA and the HKHS are making relentless efforts to optimise various arrangements to help young people with home ownership aspirations strive to climb onto the home ownership ladder. The Chief Executive announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the HA would adjust the ratio between public rental housing (PRH) (including Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme flats) and SSF from 7:3 to 6:4 in order to increase the supply of SSF. In the next five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30), the HA and the HKHS will complete about 56 500 SSF. Meanwhile, the HA is implementing the arrangement announced in the 2022 Policy Address regarding the minimum floor area for new flats. The saleable area of all SSF completed from 2026-27 onwards will be no less than 26 square metres in general. Furthermore, in the latter part of the coming decade, we will reserve 10 per cent increase in floor area for public housing. We are also exploring other measures to further assist young people in purchasing SSF and the measures will be launched in a timely manner. That said, we would like to take this opportunity to appeal to young people once again to unleash their potential and create a more prosperous future, but not to limit their room for development just for the sake of meeting the eligibility criteria for PRH application. In the past five years (i.e. 2020-21 to 2024-25), the average age of non-elderly one-person applicants that were housed to PRH was 57 years old. After understanding the above opportunities and support provided by the Government for young people, young people should plan ahead of time so as to climb higher up the housing ladder."
立法會十七題：維修大廈外牆,2025-07-30 17:30,2025-07-30 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000601.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上陳學鋒議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

有舊區樓宇單位業主向本人反映，本港不少大廈外牆的業權為該幢大廈的原發展商持有，但物業落成多年後，不少發展商已停止運作，部分該等發展商清盤後其持有的大廈外牆業權由政府接管，亦有部分大廈外牆無人管理變成「無主孤魂」而開始日久失修。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計全港有多少幢私人大廈的外牆沒有統一的業權持有人（包括部分或整體外牆業權不完整的大廈）；有多少幢私人大廈的外牆業權因發展商清盤而由政府接管，以及參與管理該等業權的政府部門為何，並按區議會分區列出該等大廈名稱及數目；

（二）政府如何處理第（一）項所述的外牆業權不完整的私人大廈及政府接管外牆業權的私人大廈所衍生的外牆維修責任，例如有否將政府管有的外牆業權以象徵式費用售予有關大廈的業主立案法團（法團）；若有，轉售業權的成功個案數目為何，以及有多少個法團拒絕接收該等外牆業權，並按區議會分區列出分項資料；

（三）有何措施確保外牆業權已由政府接收的大廈外牆結構安全；過去五年有否發生該等大廈外牆失修而導致途人受傷，並須政府承擔賠償責任的個案；若有，詳情為何；及

（四）政府如何處理屬第（一）項所述外牆業權不完整大廈而其外牆出現即時危險的情況；政府是否曾承擔有關維修責任並支付費用；若是，過往政府承擔的維修總金額為何，並按區議會分區列出分項資料？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直強調樓宇業主應妥善保養和維修樓宇，除了可延長樓宇的壽命，亦可避免因日久失修對住戶或公眾構成危險。一般而言，大廈公契作為私人合約訂明締約各方（即業主、經理人和發展商）之間的權利和責任，包括管理樓宇公用部分和其他相關事宜，以及相關維修費用的負擔等，部分公契亦會訂明外牆的業權和管理權。實際上，業主可透過成立業主立案法團（法團）、業主委員會，以及聘用持牌物業管理公司的方式，管理大廈公用部分（包括外牆）以及其他相關事宜。

《建築物管理條例》（第344章）亦有對管理和維修物業公用部分的責任作出規定。另外，市區重建局推行的樓宇復修綜合支援計劃，為樓宇業主提供財政資助和技術支援的一站式服務，包括支援業主為樓宇公用地方進行全面復修工程。民政事務總署亦會協助及支援法團，協助他們處理樓宇的管理事宜（包括樓宇外牆維修）。

就陳議員各部分的提問，經諮詢民政及青年事務局後，現回覆如下：

（一）由於樓宇不同部分的業權及其公用部分的管理責任由公契訂明，屬於私人合約協議，政府沒有統計全港有多少幢私人大廈的外牆沒有統一的業權持有人（包括部分或整體外牆業權不完整的大廈）。

由公司持有的物業，如果該公司根據《公司條例》（第622章）或《公司（清盤及雜項條文）條例》（第32章）完成清盤程序並面臨解散，則在緊接解散前歸屬該公司或以信託形式為該公司持有的所有財產及權利（例如包括一些仍未在市場售出的物業），即屬無主財物並歸屬政府，其中的土地物業，即為「無主物業」（包括大廈外牆）。地政總署一般會以出售方式處理上述屬無主財物並歸屬政府的大廈外牆（無主外牆）的業權（詳見第二部分）。仍未售出的無主外牆，則會由地政總署繼續管理。

截至二○二五年六月，被地政總署接管並仍由其管理的無主外牆個案共有56宗，（按區議會分區）詳情載列於附件一。由於部分由地政總署接管的無主外牆只佔外牆整體業權的一部分，地政總署會根據大廈公契，按其接管的外牆的權益份額而承擔相應的管理及維修責任。

（二）地政總署一般會以出售方式處理其接管的無主物業，但由於外牆的業權不適合在公開市場出售，署方一般會邀請相關的大廈法團以象徵式費用（即1,000元）承接無主外牆的業權。自二○一○年至今，地政總署已成功將24宗無主外牆的業權轉售相關大廈法團，有關大廈名單詳列於附件二。

至於在第（一）部分提及的56宗現由地政總署管理的無主外牆個案中，地政總署已就當中13宗正式邀請大廈法團承接業權，但尚待相關法團回覆，有關樓宇大廈名單詳列於附件三；地政總署另正就42宗安排與相關法團就轉讓事宜進行初步磋商；餘下一宗個案則因大廈未有成立法團而暫未有轉售的計劃。至今沒有法團明確拒絕地政總署就無主外牆個案發出的邀請，地政總署會繼續與相關法團磋商轉讓事宜。

若果有大廈的外牆業權不統一（即並非由單一業主或公司持有）或不完整（例如有個別業權不清），一般而言，業主須根據大廈公契，由法團或業主共同磋商及承擔有關外牆管理及維修的責任。

（三）就由地政總署管理的無主外牆而言，地政總署的責任與其他業主無異。地政總署人員會定期視察外牆的狀況，如有需要，會安排工程承辦商進行適當維修，以確保其結構安全及妥當。根據地政總署的紀錄，由地政總署管理的無主外牆過往從未出現因失修以致途人受傷的個案。

（四）屋宇署一直採取多管齊下的措施保障私人樓宇的建築安全。不論業權狀況如何，如發現樓宇包括外牆對公眾構成即時危險，署方會安排政府承建商進行緊急工程，並在完成緊急工程後向業主追討工程的相關費用、監督費及附加費。換言之，有關費用最終應該是由業主而非署方承擔。

就上述第（一）部分提及由地政總署管理的無主外牆，並沒有出現即時危險而需由屋宇署介入或代維修的個案。"
LCQ17: Repair and maintenance of external walls of buildings,2025-07-30 17:30,2025-07-30 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000592.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hok-fung and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

Some flat owners of buildings in old districts have relayed to me that titles to the external walls of many buildings in Hong Kong are held by the original developers of those buildings. However, quite a number of these developers have ceased operations over the years following completion of the buildings. The Government has assumed ownership of the external walls of buildings held by some of such developers after their liquidation. There are also cases in which the external walls of buildings are left unattended, be turned into ""abandoned structures"" and become dilapidated. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the number of private buildings in Hong Kong where titles to their external walls are not unified (including buildings with incomplete titles to part or the whole of their external walls); of the number of private buildings with titles to their external walls taken over by the Government due to the fact that the developer concerned has gone into liquidation, and the government departments involved in managing such titles, together with a breakdown of the names and numbers of such buildings by District Council (DC) district;

(2) how the Government will handle the issue concerning the responsibilities for repair and maintenance of the external walls arising from private buildings with incomplete titles to their external walls and those with titles to their external walls taken over by the Government as mentioned in (1), e.g. whether the Government has transferred the titles to the external walls under its possession to the owners' corporations (OC(s)) of the relevant buildings at nominal cost; if so, of the number of successful cases of title transfer, and the number of OCs refusing acceptance of such transfer, together with a breakdown by DC district;

(3) of the measures in place to ensure structural safety of the external walls of the buildings where titles to the external walls have been taken over by the Government; whether there have been cases in the past five years where dilapidated external walls of such buildings caused injuries to pedestrians and the Government was required to assume responsibility for compensation; if so, of the details; and

(4) how the Government will handle the situation mentioned in (1) above in which the titles to the external walls of buildings are incomplete while their external walls are posing immediate danger; whether the Government has assumed any responsibility for repair and maintenance and paid for the relevant works; if so, of the total amount of repairs or maintenance costs incurred by the Government in the past, together with a breakdown by DC district?

Reply:

President,

The Government has all along been emphasising that building owners should properly maintain and repair their buildings. Apart from extending the life of their buildings, danger to the occupants or the general public arising from dilapidation can also be avoided. Generally speaking, the Deeds of Mutual Covenant (DMCs) of a building, being a private contract, stipulate the rights and obligations among the parties concerned (i.e. owners, managers and developers), including management of the common parts of buildings and other related matters, as well as bearing of the relevant maintenance costs, etc. Some DMCs also specify the titles to and the management right of external walls. In fact, owners may manage the common parts (including external walls) of their buildings and other related matters by forming owners' corporations (OCs), owners' committees and engaging licensed property management companies.

The Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) also stipulates the responsibilities for management and maintenance of the common parts of a property. Moreover, the Urban Renewal Authority has launched an all-in-one Integrated Building Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme, providing financial assistance and technical support to building owners, including support for owners to carry out comprehensive maintenance works for the common areas of their buildings. The Home Affairs Department also provides assistance and support to OCs in handling building management matters (including maintenance of the external walls of buildings).

Our reply, prepared in consultation with the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Chan is as follows:

(1) As the titles to different parts of buildings and the responsibilities for managing their common parts are stipulated in the DMCs, which are private contractual agreements, the Government has not compiled statistics on the number of private buildings in Hong Kong where titles to their external walls are not unified (including buildings with incomplete titles to part or the whole of their external walls).

For properties owned by companies, if the company, pursuant to the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) or the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32), completes the procedures for winding up and is about to dissolve, every property and right (such as including some properties that are yet to be sold in the market) vested in or held on trust for the company immediately before the dissolution is vested in the Government as bona vacantia. Among these, land properties are ""bona vacantia properties"" (including their external walls). In general, the Lands Department (LandsD) will dispose of the titles to the external walls (bona vacantia external walls) of the aforesaid buildings which are vested in the Government as bona vacantia by way of sale (please see part (2) for details). Unsold bona vacantia external walls will continue to be managed by the LandsD.

As of June 2025, there are a total of 56 cases involving bona vacantia external walls which have been taken over and are still managed by the LandsD, the details of which (by District Council district) are set out at Annex 1. Given some of the bona vacantia external walls taken over by the LandsD only account for a portion of the overall ownership of the external walls, the LandsD will shoulder the management and maintenance responsibilities corresponding to its share of interests in the external walls in accordance with the DMCs.

(2) In general, the LandsD will dispose of bona vacantia properties that it has taken over by way of sale. However, as the titles to external walls are not suitable for sale in the open market, the LandsD will normally invite the OC of the buildings concerned to take over the ownership of bona vacantia external walls at a nominal fee (i.e. $1,000). Since 2010, the LandsD has successfully transferred the titles of 24 cases of bona vacantia external walls to the OCs of the buildings concerned by sale. A list of these buildings is set out at Annex 2.

Among the 56 cases of bona vacantia external walls currently managed by the LandsD as mentioned in part (1), the LandsD has officially invited the OCs of the buildings concerned to take over the titles of 13 cases, but the OCs have yet to respond. A list of the buildings concerned is set out at Annex 3. The LandsD is arranging initial negotiation with the relevant OCs regarding the transfer of titles for the other 42 cases. As for the remaining case, there is no plan for transfer for the time being as no OC has been formed in the building. So far, no OC has explicitly rejected the offer regarding bona vacantia external walls, and the LandsD will continue to negotiate with the relevant OCs on the transfer matters.

Generally speaking, for buildings where titles to their external walls are not unified (i.e. not held by a single owner or company) or are incomplete (e.g. individual titles are unclear), the OCs or the owners should jointly negotiate and bear the responsibilities for management and maintenance of external walls in accordance with the DMCs.

(3) For bona vacantia external walls managed by the LandsD, the department bears the same responsibilities as other owners. The LandsD staff will inspect the conditions of external walls on a regular basis and, if necessary, will arrange for works contractors to carry out repairs as appropriate to ensure their structural safety and that they are in a good state. According to the records of the LandsD, there has not been any case of injuries to pedestrians due to dilapidation of bona vacantia external walls under its management.

(4) The Buildings Department (BD) has been adopting a multi-pronged approach to ensure the safety of private buildings. Regardless of ownership status, if it is found that a building, including its external walls, poses an imminent danger to the public, the BD will arrange for government contractors to carry out emergency works and subsequently recover the relevant works costs, supervision fees, and surcharges from the owners. In other words, the relevant fees should be ultimately borne by the owners, rather than the BD.

Regarding the bona vacantia external walls managed by the LandsD mentioned in part (1) above, none of the concerned cases require intervention or repair works by the BD due to imminent danger."

Leasing arrangements announced for public market stalls in August,2025-07-30 16:50,2025-07-30 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000603.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) announced today (July 30) that open auctions for a total of 474 stalls in 43 public markets will be held in August. Market stalls not taken at open auctions will be available to the public for renting at their upset prices on August 22 on a first-come, first-served basis.

(2) Renting at upset prices on first-come, first-served basis

The tenancy agreement of market stalls renting on a first-come, first-served basis is a three-year fixed term from October 1, with no right of renewal upon expiry of the tenancy agreement. The upset prices of the monthly rent of the stalls vary depending on their sizes, locations, vacancy periods and the reduced upset prices from the last open auction of the individual stalls. Relevant information is available on the FEHD website after the open auction.

Members of the public who are interested in renting a market stall at its upset price should approach the following FEHD offices, as appropriate, to apply in person from 9.30am to 12.30pm or 2.30pm to 4.30pm on August 22 (Friday):

A spokesman for the FEHD said, ""Bidders or applicants for the market stalls must be at least 18 years old and ordinarily reside in Hong Kong. To allow more people to bid for or select the stalls and increase customer choices by enhancing the diversity in terms of the variety of stalls, there will be a restriction on the number of stalls to be rented in the same market by a single tenant. Any person who is currently a stall tenant is not allowed to bid in the first round of auction for any stall in the same market, and will only be allowed to bid for one stall in the second round of auction or to select one stall in the same market on a first-come, first-served basis. The existing tenants under the new three-year fixed term tenancy scheme (i.e. those persons who became stall tenants through the market open auctions after August 2022) are allowed to bid for a stall in the auction or select a stall on a first-come, first-served basis in the same market, but shall vacate the current stall and return it to the FEHD before the effective date of commencement of the new tenancy agreement.""

The report provides all sectors of the community and Mainland and overseas investors with details on Hong Kong's latest developments and strengths, comprehensively showcasing Hong Kong's open, safe, stable, efficient and internationalised business environment. The report has been uploaded to the ""Hong Kong Economy"" website: www.hkeconomy.gov.hk/en/environment/index.htm.

   A Government spokesman said, ""Following the report issued in 2021, the HKSAR Government has published another relevant report. With solid facts and data, the latest report systematically and clearly demonstrates to the world that Hong Kong's development has been picking up in recent years as social stability has been restored and the city has emerged from the pandemic. It aims to deepen the understanding of friends and investors worldwide about the latest situation in various fields in Hong Kong, encouraging them to fully leverage Hong Kong's unique advantages of having connections to both the Mainland and the world under 'one country, two systems', its role as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder', and to seize new opportunities that emerge.""

  The report elaborates on Hong Kong's institutional advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement and explains the Government's policy priorities and achievements in promoting high-quality economic development, including continuously strengthening competitiveness, as well as its achievements in attracting capital inflows, pooling together enterprises and attracting talent. It also showcases Hong Kong's latest developments and potential in finance, trade, aviation, maritime, innovation and technology, intellectual property trade, and legal services, as well as culture, sports and tourism.

  The spokesman said, ""Over the past few years, the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance has restored a stable social environment in Hong Kong. This has not only protected the rights and freedoms of the general public but has also made Hong Kong a safe harbour for attracting international capital and investment. The continued inflow of capital, the promising growth of the stock market, domestic and overseas companies setting up their presence in Hong Kong, talent pursuing development in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's top rankings in numerous international rankings demonstrate that Hong Kong's open, secure, stable and efficient business environment has been widely recognised internationally, and the confidence of international investors and businesses in Hong Kong is further growing.""

  In fact, the current-term Government has achieved remarkable results in attracting enterprises, investment and talent. For example, in 2024, the number of companies in Hong Kong with parent companies located outside the territory significantly increased by about 10 per cent, reaching nearly 10 000, while the number of start-ups reached nearly 4 700, both reaching record highs. The Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, established over two years ago, has attracted 84 strategic enterprises to set up or expand their business in Hong Kong, including enterprises with a market capitalisation or valuation exceeding $10 billion and engaged in cutting-edge technologies. From January 2023 to the first six months of 2025, Invest Hong Kong assisted over 1 300 overseas and Mainland companies to set up or expand their business in Hong Kong, bringing in investment of more than $160 billion.

  In terms of talent, as of June 2025, a total of nearly 500 000 applications under various talent admission schemes were received, nearly 330 000 of which were approved, and nearly 220 000 talents have arrived in Hong Kong.

  This year, the performance of Hong Kong's financial markets has steadily improved. The Hang Seng Index recorded an increase of 18 per cent last year and an increase of more than 25 per cent this year so far. The average daily turnover in the stock market for the first half of the year was around $240 billion, with an increase of around 120 per cent. According to the Securities and Futures Commission's Asset and Wealth Management Activities Survey 2024 published this month, Hong Kong's asset and wealth management business showed further growth, with total assets under management at over $35 trillion as of end-2024, representing a year-on-year gain of 13 per cent.

  The spokesman said, ""In a complex and volatile external environment, Hong Kong is experiencing economic upgrading and transformation, but there are more opportunities than challenges. With the strong support from our country and the collective efforts of the Government, various sectors and residents, Hong Kong will leverage the advantages of the 'one country, two systems' arrangement and capitalise on national development opportunities. By developing innovation and technology and new quality productive forces, and deepening international and regional exchanges and co-operation, Hong Kong will pave the way for new growth prospects."""

LCQ10: Promoting virtual asset development,2025-07-30 16:08,2025-07-30 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000312.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Shang Hailong and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

 In 2022 and this year, the SAR Government promulgated two policy statements on the development of virtual assets (VA) in Hong Kong respectively, explicitly positioning the city as a premier global hub for digital assets and taking forward various legislative and regulatory measures. These include the passage of the Stablecoins Bill and the introduction of a licensing regime for VA service providers (the licensing regime). However, some industry participants have expressed concerns about whether the existing policies can strike an appropriate balance between investor protection and innovation promotion, and how Hong Kong will address international competition (such as the regulatory frameworks for stablecoins established by the United States and Singapore). In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as there are views that under the existing licensing regime, only 10 institutions from both local and overseas markets have been granted licences, and that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)'s approval speed lags behind that of competitors such as Singapore, whether the authorities have drawn up a specific timetable to further streamline the licensing process, in order to attract more compliant enterprises to establish a presence in Hong Kong; whether it will draw reference from international standards (such as the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) to develop a more flexible regulatory sandbox mechanism that encourage trials of financial technology;

(2) whether the authorities will, within the next three years, regularise the issuance of tokenised bonds and extend this to other asset classes (such as real estate or private equity funds); how the Government will resolve the current lack of uniformity in cross-institutional tokenisation standards, for example, whether it will establish a co-ordination mechanism jointly with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, SFC and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited; and

(3) whether it will strengthen co-operation with relevant Mainland institutions (such as the Digital Currency Institute of the People's Bank of China) and international organisations (such as the International Monetary Fund), in order to establish cross-boundary agreements on VA regulation and anti-money laundering initiatives?

Reply:

President,

 The Government issued the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong (Policy Statement 2.0) in June 2025. Building on the first policy statement released in October 2022, Policy Statement 2.0 reaffirms the Government's commitment to positioning Hong Kong as a global hub for innovation in the digital asset field.

 One of the key focuses of Policy Statement 2.0 is enhancing the legal and regulatory framework. A comprehensive regulatory framework provides a solid foundation for the sustainable development of the digital asset sector. Following the implementation of the licensing regime for digital asset trading platforms in June 2023, the Stablecoins Ordinance will come into effect on August 1 this year. At the same time, the Government and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) are consulting the public on the licensing regimes for digital asset dealing service and custodian service providers, with a view to formulating the legislative proposals as soon as practicable. Upon the completion of the legislative work, the regulatory framework in Hong Kong will provide comprehensive coverage of the key nodes of the digital asset industry, balancing risk management and investor protection, while providing favourable conditions for market development and financial innovation.

 After consulting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the SFC, and the Hong Kong Police Force, our reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) As of early July 2025, the SFC has officially granted licences to 11 digital asset trading platforms with both local and overseas background, and is processing an additional nine licence applications. The time required to process licence applications regarding digital asset trading platform varies, depending on various factors such as the completeness of the information provided by the applicants, the adequacy of the supporting documents submitted by the applicants, and the time taken by the applicants to respond to requests for further information during the SFC's assessment process.

 Based on the practical experience in processing licence applications, the SFC from time to time reviews and enhances relevant procedures to help applicants better understand the SFC's regulatory expectations, thereby reducing the time required for licence assessments. In this regard, the SFC launched a swift licensing process in June 2024, under risk-based on-site inspections would be conducted on those deemed-to-be-licensed digital asset trading platform applicants. During the process, the SFC would communicate direct with the senior management and ultimate controllers of the relevant applicants about regulatory standards, so as to reduce the time required for granting relevant licences.

 Subsequently, the SFC expanded in January 2025 the scope of the swift licensing process to include all new applicants for a digital asset trading platform licence. Under the swift licensing process, applicants are required to first establish internal policies, procedures, systems and monitoring measures, which must then undergo external assessment. The SFC acts as one of the parties overseeing the entire external assessment process. The SFC continues to review the circumstances in respect of applications for a digital asset trading platform licence, with a view to facilitating more digital asset trading platform operators from diverse backgrounds to commence business in Hong Kong.

 In addition, to promote financial innovation, regulatory authorities such as the HKMA, the SFC, and the Insurance Authority have established various regulatory sandbox mechanisms. These enable innovative use cases in tokenisation, blockchain, generative AI (artificial intelligence) and insurance technology to be tested under a risk-controlled environment before their actual application, while receiving technical support and regulatory feedback from the regulatory authorities. The design of these sandboxes has taken reference to both local and overseas experience to foster a healthy and sustainable environment for the market, helping financial institutions seize opportunities and responsibly adopt financial technologies.

(2) The Government made two issuances of tokenised green bonds in 2023 and 2024, which demonstrated the benefits of tokenisation and were well received by the market. The two issuances represented the first tokenised green bond issued by a government and the first multi-currency digitally native tokenised bonds in the world respectively. In the 2025-26 Budget, the Government announced the regularisation of tokenised bond issuance, and the HKMA is currently preparing for the third issuance.

 As highlighted in Policy Statement 2.0, the Government recognises the potential of tokenisation of traditional financial products and real-world assets. The Government has also observed growing interest among financial institutions in tokenising traditional financial instruments, and that more and more intermediaries are exploring tokenisation of securities and distributing tokenised securities. In fact, the SFC issued ""Circular on intermediaries engaging in tokenised securities-related activities"" and ""Circular on tokenisation of SFC-authorised investment products"" in November 2023, providing guidance to intermediaries on managing new risks posed by tokenisation technology and related investment products, thereby promoting the steady, responsible and sustainable development of the tokenisation market.

 Building on the above, the SFC authorised in 2024 the first tokenised investment product for retail access in Hong Kong. That is a gold token that allows investors to acquire fractional ownership of physical gold. In the first quarter of 2025, the SFC further authorised three retail tokenised money market funds, which were the first in the Asia Pacific region. As of the end of March 2025, these funds had a total of over $700 million assets under management.

 Meanwhile, through the HKMA's Project Ensemble, we are actively encouraging innovative use cases, including the tokenisation of traditional financial products (e.g. money market funds and other funds) and revenue streams of real-world assets (e.g. electric vehicle charging stations). The SFC is a key partner of Project Ensemble, and has been working with the HKMA to promote the wider adoption of tokenisation in the asset management industry. The HKMA is also exploring the development of innovative financial market infrastructure, providing a unified technical foundation to facilitate interbank settlement of tokenised deposits.

(3) Hong Kong has been actively participating in international efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, including the development of standards and regulations relating to digital assets. In particular, Hong Kong's regime for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing has been recognised by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the setter of relevant international standards, as both overall compliant and effective, especially in international co-operation.

 Currently, Hong Kong is participating in the discussion of the Virtual Assets Contact Group under the FATF, so as to keep abreast of the latest related risks in respect of money laundering and terrorist financing and to foster international collaboration in this area. Meanwhile, the HKMA is leading the Financial Stability Board's review of the global implementation of the global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities.

 In addition, the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit under the Hong Kong Police Force is a member of the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, exchanging information with over 160 member financial intelligence units worldwide. This supports cross-jurisdiction enforcement and intelligence-sharing efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, including cases involving digital assets.

 At the same time, the anti-money laundering related agencies in the Mainland, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macao Special Administrative Region have established mechanisms for regular exchanges and close collaboration.

 The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, financial regulators and law enforcement agencies will continue to monitor the risks associated with money laundering, terrorist financing and digital assets. We will maintain close communication and collaboration with relevant international organisations and relevant agencies in other jurisdictions, including the Mainland.

 Hong Kong has also maintained close communication with regulators around the world on the regulation and developments of digital assets. As major regions around the world gradually implement regulatory regimes related to digital assets, Hong Kong will continue to exchange regulatory experience with the international community, strengthen cross-border/cross-boundary regulatory collaboration, and jointly promote financial stability and innovation."
立法會十題：促進虛擬資產的發展,2025-07-30 16:08,2025-07-30 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000308.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上尚海龍議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

特區政府於二○二二年及本年先後發布兩份有關虛擬資產在港發展的政策宣言，明確將香港定位為全球領先的數字資產中心，並推動多項立法及監管措施，包括通過《穩定幣條例草案》及引入虛擬資產服務提供者發牌制度（發牌制度）。然而，有業界人士關注現行政策能否在保障投資者與促進創新之間取得平衡，以及香港如何應對國際競爭（例如美國及新加坡就穩定幣建立監管框架）。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有意見認為在現行發牌制度下，僅有10間來自本地和海外的機構獲批牌照，證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）的審批速度較新加坡等競爭對手緩慢，當局有否制訂具體時間表以進一步簡化發牌程序，以吸引更多合規企業落戶香港；會否參考國際標準（例如歐盟的《加密資產市場監管法案》），制訂更具彈性的監管沙盒機制，鼓勵金融科技試驗；

（二）當局會否在未來三年將代幣化債券的發行常規化，並擴展至其他資產類別（例如房地產或私募基金）；政府會如何解決目前跨機構代幣化標準不統一的問題，例如會否與香港金融管理局、證監會及香港交易及結算所有限公司共同訂立協調機制；及

（三）會否與內地相關機構（例如中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所）及國際組織（例如國際貨幣基金組織）加強合作，建立跨境虛擬資產監管及反洗錢協議？

答覆：

主席：

政府於二○二五年六月發表《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》（《政策宣言2.0》）。《政策宣言2.0》建基於二○二二年十月發表的首份政策宣言，重申政府致力將香港打造成數字資產領域中的全球創新中心。

《政策宣言2.0》其中一方面的重點是優化法律與監管。一套整全的監管框架為數字資產行業的可持續發展提供穩固基礎。繼數字資產交易平台發牌制度於二○二三年六月實施後，《穩定幣條例》將於今年八月一日生效。與此同時，政府與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）正就數字資產交易服務提供者和數字資產託管服務提供者發牌制度諮詢公眾，以期盡快訂定立法建議。在有關立法工作完成後，香港的監管框架將全面涵蓋數字資產行業的主要節點，平衡風險管理和投資者保障，同時為市場發展和金融創新提供有利條件。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢香港金融管理局（金管局），證監會及香港警務處，我現答覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年七月初，證監會已正式發牌予11個來自本地和海外的數字資產交易平台，並正處理另外九個牌照申請。證監會處理數字資產交易平台牌照申請所需的時間受多項因素影響而有所不同，例如申請人所提供的資料是否完備；申請人提供的證明文件是否齊全；及在證監會的評核過程中，申請人就提供任何進一步資料而作出回應的所需時間等。

因應處理數字資產交易平台牌照申請的實際經驗，證監會不時檢視和優化相關程序，促進申請人更有效了解證監會的監管預期，以縮短證監會評估牌照申請所需的時間。就此，證監會於二○二四年六月起推行迅速發牌程序，對被當作獲發牌的數字資產交易平台申請者進行以風險為本的現場視察，與相關申請者的高層及最終控制人就監管標準作直接溝通，縮短了批出相關牌照所需的時間。

其後，證監會於二○二五年一月起，將迅速發牌程序的適用範圍擴展至所有數字資產交易平台牌照的新申請者。在迅速發牌程序下，數字資產交易平台申請者需要先落實內部的政策、程序、系統及監控措施，然後對有關措施進行外部評估。證監會將成為協定的參與方，以監督整個外部評估過程。證監會會持續檢視數字資產交易平台牌照的申請情況，以促進更多不同背景的數字資產交易平台營運者在香港展開相關業務。

另外，為了鼓勵金融創新，金管局、證監會和保險業監管局等監管機構設有不同監管沙盒機制，讓代幣化、區塊鏈，以至生成式人工智能及保險科技等金融科技在實際應用前，在風險可控的情況下測試創新用例，並獲取監管機構的技術支持及監管意見。監管機構設計沙盒時會參考海內外經驗，以締造健康及可持續的市場環境，協助金融機構抓緊機遇，負責任地採用金融科技。

（二）政府在二○二三年和二○二四年先後兩次以代幣化形式發行綠色債券，展示了代幣化方案的效益，並獲市場歡迎。該兩此債券發行分別是全球首批政府代幣化綠色債券及全球首批多幣種數碼原生代幣化債券。政府已在二○二五至二六年度的《財政預算案》中宣布將代幣化債券發行恒常化，而金管局目前正為第三次發行作準備。

正如《政策宣言2.0》所述，政府明白傳統金融產品及現實世界資產代幣化的潛力。政府亦留意到金融機構對於將傳統金融工具代幣化的興趣日趨濃厚，而探討將證券代幣化和向客戶分銷代幣化證券的中介人亦不斷增加。事實上，證監會於二○二三年十一月發出《有關中介人從事代幣化證券相關活動的通函》及《有關代幣化證監會認可投資產品的通函》，藉此向中介人提供指引，以妥善管理代幣化技術和相關投資產品所帶來的新風險，促進代幣化市場穩健、負責任及可持續發展。

建基於上述基礎，證監會在二○二四年已經認可了首項可供香港散戶買賣的代幣化投資產品，該黃金代幣允許投資者購買實金擁有權的一部分。證監會更在二○二五年第一季度認可了亞太區首批三隻容許散戶投資的代幣化貨幣市場基金，截至二○二五年三月底，這些基金的管理資產總值超過七億元。

與此同時，透過金管局的Ensemble項目，我們積極鼓勵創新應用場景，包括代幣化傳統金融產品（如貨幣市場基金及其他基金）以及現實世界資產（如電動車充電站）的收益流。而證監會亦為Ensemble項目的主要合作夥伴，與金管局共同促進資產管理行業相關代幣化的廣泛應用。金管局亦正探索建立創新的金融市場基礎設施，並提供統一的技術基礎，促進銀行間代幣化存款的結算。

（三）香港一直積極參與國際間有關打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的工作，包括與數字資產相關的標準制訂和監管工作。其中，香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度獲負責制訂相關國際標準的財務行動特別組織確認為整體合規而有效，而在國際合作方面取得的成效尤其顯著。

目前，香港正參與財務行動特別組織轄下的虛擬資產工作小組的討論，以了解相關最新的洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險，並促進國際間在有關方面的合作。金管局亦同時牽頭金融穩定理事會對加密資產活動全球監管框架在全球各地實施情況的檢討工作。

另外，香港警務處轄下的聯合財富情報組是國際金融情報組織埃格蒙特組織的成員，與組織當中超過160個來自世界各地的財富情報單位交換資訊，合力支援跨司法管轄區的執法和交換情報工作，促進國際間有關打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（包括涉及數字資產的案件）的執法工作。

與此同時，內地、香港特別行政區與澳門特別行政區三地與反洗錢相關的部門已建立機制，就有關工作定期交流與保持緊密協作。

財經事務及庫務局、金融監管機構和執法機構會繼續密切留意有關洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集和數字資產的風險，持續與相關的國際組織和其他司法管轄區（包括內地）的相關機構保持緊密溝通與合作。

香港亦一直就數字資產監管及發展與各地監管機構保持密切溝通。隨着全球主要地區逐步推動與數字資產相關的監管制度，香港將繼續與國際社會互相交流監管經驗，強化跨境監管合作，共同促進金融穩定和創新。"
LCQ5: Establishment of smart education platform and large language models,2025-07-30 16:03,2025-07-30 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000556.htm,"  Following is a question by Professor the Hon William Wong and a reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

  It has been reported that the Mainland has set up a national smart education public service platform (""smart education platform"") covering primary and secondary education, vocational education, higher education and lifelong learning to provide personalised online interactive learning materials along with round-the-clock support for students and continuing education participants. Some members of the community have suggested that the Government should prioritise the establishment of large language models (LLMs) and an education platform applicable in Hong Kong's education system and incorporate therein correct history, culture and values so as to elevate the quality of education and the depth of cultural inheritance in the territory. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the total numbers of educational institutions in Hong Kong (including universities, secondary and primary schools, and vocational education institutions) which have currently established on-premises LLMs for subject-based education;

(2) whether it has plans to develop LLMs of subject-based education with local characteristics for use by students and people pursuing further studies in Hong Kong; if so, when the development will begin; if not, whether it will consider establishing such models; and

(3) given that the Mainland has already established a smart education platform, whether the Government will consider discussing with relevant Mainland authorities the possibility of replicating the platform in Hong Kong and adapting them for use by local educational institutions at various levels, following integration with the local curriculum?

Reply:

President,

  As global digitalisation continues to progress, the Education Bureau (EDB), in line with the national strategy for invigorating the country through science and education, actively promotes education innovation and takes forward digital education in order to nurture future talents to embrace the challenges and opportunities in the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI). With the formation of the Steering Committee on Strategic Development of Digital Education, we have identified the directions and key focus areas for digital education, and are continuously optimising the curricula, strengthening relevant training for teachers, improving digital education infrastructure, enhancing learning platforms and AI technology as well as collaborating with stakeholders from various sectors, with a view to promoting the implementation of digital education and enhancing the quality of local education.

  Our consolidated reply to the question raised by Professor the Hon William Wong is as follows:

  With training in the form of deep learning of massive amounts of text data, large language models (LLMs) are able to generate natural language text and handle various natural language tasks such as text summarisation, questioning and answering, and translation. In the field of education, the application of LLMs serves as a learning and teaching aid which assists teachers in preparing lessons, setting questions and marking assignments on one hand, and help students search for information, obtain writing advice, etc on the other hand. At present, the application of LLMs in teaching is being developed and improved continuously. To effectively enhance the quality of education and the depth of cultural heritage, including incorporating proper values with respect to history and culture through the application of LLMs, it is essential for teachers to apply technology in a professional manner and make reference to resources from local, national and international online platforms, so as to flexibly adopt teaching strategies and design quality learning activities which align with the curriculum and meet the needs of students.

  In this connection, the EDB has been encouraging and supporting schools to explore and adopt diversified and appropriate teaching strategies based on their school contexts and students' learning needs, and to make good use of technology including LLMs. At the same time, schools are encouraged to nurture students' information literacy as well as proper attitudes and values towards the application of innovation and technology (I&T) which align with the aims and objectives of the school curriculum. Currently, some schools in Hong Kong are trying to develop school-based LLMs for application in learning and teaching. While the EDB supports school-based innovation, we do not require all schools to develop their own LLMs for subject-based teaching at the present stage. As such, relevant statistics are not available. To keep abreast of the times, we will closely take heed of the trends in technological development and application, strengthen the professional development of teachers, and review the application of LLMs in a timely manner.

  To promote digital transformation in education, we have allocated $500million under the Quality Education Fund for the implementation of the e-Learning Ancillary Facilities Programme to develop e-learning ancillary facilities that meet local learning and teaching needs. There are a total of 22 funded projects in which I&T such as LLMs are deployed. The deliverables of the projects are to be released in four batches starting from mid-2025 for the use of publicly-funded schools. In fact, schools may utilise different resources such as the Composite Information Technology Grant in a flexible manner according to their school contexts for procuring different digital teaching tools and platforms to tie in with subject teaching and cater for the diverse learning needs of students in learning.

  On resources development, the EDB has been committed to providing schools with quality teaching materials, including learning and teaching resources on different subjects, the Educational MultiMedia and the EDB One-stop Portal for Learning and Teaching Resources, covering the Key Learning Areas and cross-disciplinary subjects or areas at kindergarten, primary and secondary levels. The EDB has also been collaborating with the Hong Kong Education City Limited (HKEdCity) to provide one-stop services on e-learning, e-reading and e-assessment including platforms such as the eRead Scheme and the Student Assessment Repository to meet the needs of local schools, and with the provision of the online learning platform and related courses on AI and computational thinking for students, the aim of sharing resources is achieved.

  Regarding the smart education platform developed by our country, local teachers and students at present can browse around for free without the need to register. However, as the curricula of the two places vary, Hong Kong schools need to make adaptations and relevant technical adjustments when using the platform. The EDB has already liaised with relevant authorities to gain insights into the mode of operation and types of resources provided by the platform. We will also actively study and make reference to the relevant experience of the platform, so as to explore feasible options for the enhancement of local teaching and learning resource platforms to better support learning and teaching. We will continue to strengthen professional teacher training on I&T and AI, optimise the platform of the HKEdCity, make reference to and utilise existing high-quality learning and teaching platforms, LLMs and programmes locally and from our country and overseas, encourage cross-sectoral and cross-school sharing of resources, and explore cost-effective approaches to further support the learning and teaching of digital education in Hong Kong.

  For post-secondary education, with the advent of AI, innovative and breakthrough technology in the new era, post-secondary institutions are encouraged to actively explore and experiment in teaching and learning. Amongst others, the University Grants Committee (UGC) launched the $100 million Fund for Innovative Technology-in-Education in 2023 to provide an impetus for universities to harness innovative and breakthrough technologies in transforming pedagogies and enriching student learning experiences. The eight UGC-funded universities are capitalising on the funding to continuously implement around 100 new projects, with the aim to drive transformation in pedagogies, curricula, assessments, and student development; advance digital competency comprehensively; promote technological social responsibilities and academic integrity; and foster academia-industry collaboration and enhance authentic learning experience. The goal is to nurture university students into a digitally competent and technologically responsible new generation under the digital economy. These projects are underway and expected to be completed in 2026.

  In addition, through targeted support measures, including the Enhancement and Start-up Grant Scheme for Self-financing Post-secondary Education, as well as the Quality Enhancement Support Scheme, we support universities of applied sciences and self-financing post-secondary education institutions to enhance teaching quality by seizing the opportunities arising from technological advancement and make good use of AI.

  In response to the rapid development of AI technologies, the Vocational Training Council (VTC) has also established the Hong Kong Institute of Information Technology (HKIIT), which admitted its first cohort of students in the 2024/25 academic year (AY). The VTC is developing AI-enabled interactive learning materials, including introducing educational chatbots to provide students with instant learning feedback to enhance their learning outcomes. The EDB has been supporting post-secondary institutions to introduce appropriate teaching frameworks and new programmes, so as to enhance support for academic staff and students, and meet ever-changing societal needs. In the 2024/25 AY, there are about 10programmes related to AI offered by the UGC-funded universities. A number of UGC-funded universities have also offered AI-related undergraduate programmes in the 2025-28 triennium in response to the strategic directions set by the Government, for example, ""Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence"" of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and ""Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science"" of the University of Hong Kong.

  As regards the self-financing post-secondary sector, institutions have the flexibility to develop programmes that meet market demands and adjust the curricula and intake places of relevant programmes, in response to the ever-changing manpower needs of society. In the 2024/25 AY, there are a total of 15 post-secondary programmes relating to AI by 10 self-financing institutions. The HKIIT of the VTC also offers a total of 21 programmes in the 2024/25 AY, covering areas including cybersecurity, AI, and software engineering.

  In sum, the EDB will continue to encourage schools to use I&T and keep a close watch on the application and development of I&T in this field, strengthen the exchange and collaboration with partners in the Mainland and overseas to facilitate the high-quality development of digitisation of local education.

  Thank you, President."
立法會五題︰建立智慧教育平台及大語言模型,2025-07-30 16:02,2025-07-30 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000551.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上黃錦輝議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的答覆︰

問題：

據報內地已建立涵蓋中小學、職業教育、高等教育和終身學習的「國家智慧教育公共服務平台」（智慧教育平台），為學生和持續進修人士提供個人化、全天候支援的線上互動學習教材。有社會人士建議，政府應優先建立適用於香港教育體系的大語言模型及教育平台，並融入正確的歷史、文化與價值觀，藉此提升本地教育質素及文化傳承的深度。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計，目前全港共有多少間學校（包括大、中及小學，以及職業教育學校）已在校內建立分科教育的大語言模型；

（二）有否計劃開發供香港學生和進修人士使用，並具本地特色的分科教育大語言模型；如有，何時開始推展；如否，會否考慮建立有關模型；及

（三）鑑於內地已設立智慧教育平台，政府會否考慮與內地相關部門商討，將該平台移植至香港，並在融合本地課程後，供本地各級學校使用？

答覆：

主席：

在全球數字化持續推進，配合國家科教興國戰略，教育局積極推動教育創新，開展數字教育，培育未來人才，迎接人工智能時代的挑戰和機遇。我們通過成立的「數字教育策略發展督導委員會」，訂定數字教育的方向和重點，持續優化課程、加強教師培訓、完善數字教育基礎建設，優化學習平台和人工智能技術等，與各界不同持份者協作，推動數字教育的實踐，提升本地教育質素。

就黃錦輝議員的提問，現綜合回覆如下：

大語言模型通過海量文本數據訓練的深度學習，能夠生成自然語言文本，處理各種自然語言任務，如文本摘要、問答、翻譯等。應用於教育領域，可以輔助教師備課、出題和批改作業，協助學生查索資料、獲得寫作建議等，是輔助教學工具之一。目前，大語言模型於教學上的應用正在不斷發展和完善，要藉以提升教育質素及文化傳承的深度，包括融入正確的歷史、文化價值觀等，有賴教師專業地應用科技，參考本地、國家及其他地方網上平台的資源，配合課程及對應學生需要，靈活運用教學策略，設計優質的學習活動，方能發揮作用。

為此，教育局一直鼓勵及支持學校，因應校情及學生學習需要，探索和採用多元化適切的教學策略，善用科技，包括大語言模型等，同時，配合學校課程的宗旨和目標，培養學生的資訊素養，使用創新科技的正確態度和價值觀。現時，本港部分學校正嘗試建立校本大語言模型，並應用於學與教上。教育局支持校本創新，但現階段並沒有要求所有學校自行建立與分科教學相關的大語言模型，因此，亦未有相關統計數字。我們會密切留意科技發展及應用的趨勢，做好教師專業發展，適時檢視大語言模型的應用，與時並進。

為推動教育數字化轉型，我們透過優質教育基金（基金）撥款五億，推行「電子學習配套計劃」，發展切合本地教學需要的電子學習配套。二十二個獲基金資助的項目，均採用了創新科技，當中包括大語言模型。項目的成果自二○二五年年中開始，分四批發布，供公帑資助學校使用。事實上，學校可因應校情，靈活運用不同資源，如「資訊科技綜合津貼」等，採購不同數字教學工具與平台，配合學科教學和照顧學生多元學習需要。

在資源開發方面，教育局一直致力為學校提供優質的教材，包括不同科目的學與教資源、「教育多媒體」和「教育局一站式學與教資源平台」，涵蓋幼稚園、小學和中學各學習領域及跨學科科目或範疇；又與香港教育城有限公司（教城）合作，提供切合本地學校需要的一站式電子學習、閱讀及評估服務，包括通過「e悅讀學校計劃」、「學生評估資源庫（STAR）」等平台，配合為學生提供的人工智能和運算思維的網上學習平台和有關課程，達至資源共享的目的。

至於國家開發的智慧教育平台，現時本港師生無需登記，可以免費瀏覽；然而，兩地課程不同，本港學校使用上述平台，需進行調適及作相關技術調整。目前，教育局已與智慧教育平台相關部門連繫，了解平台的運作模式與資源類型，並將積極研究及借鑑相關平台的經驗，探討可行方案，優化本地的教學資源平台，更好支援學與教。我們會繼續加強創科及人工智能教育的教師專業培訓，優化教城平台，參考及善用本地、國家及海外的優質學與教平台、大語言模型及程式等，鼓勵跨界別及跨校資源共享，探討具成本效益的模式，進一步支援本港數字教育的學與教。

在專上教育方面，隨着人工智能、創新和突破性科技的湧現，我們鼓勵專上院校在教與學上積極探索及嘗試。其中，大學教育資助委員會（教資會）於二○二三年撥款一億元，設立科教創新基金，鼓勵大學利用創新及突破性科技推進教學革新及豐富學習體驗。八所教資會資助大學正利用撥款，持續推行約100個新項目，達致推動教學法、課程、評估和學生發展的轉型；全面提升數碼素養；推廣科技社會責任和學術誠信；以及促進學術界與產業協作，增強真實學習體驗，務求培養大學生在數字化經濟環境中成為德才兼備的新世代人才等目標。目前，各項目正進行當中，預計將於二○二六年完成。

另外，我們通過針對性的支援措施，包括自資專上教育提升及啟動補助金計劃及質素提升支援計劃等，支持應用科學大學、自資專上院校把握科技發展的機遇，善用人工智能等，提升教學質素。

因應人工智能技術的快速發展，職業訓練局（職訓局）亦成立了香港資訊科技學院，於二○二四／二五學年錄取首屆學生。現時，職訓局正發展人工智能互動學習教材，包括引入教育聊天機械人，為學生提供即時學習回饋，協助他們提升學習成效。教育局一直支持院校推行適切的教學框架及新課程，加強對教學人員及學生的支持，以回應時代轉變，滿足社會需求。在二○二四／二五學年，教資會資助大學已開設約10個與人工智能相關的課程。在二○二五至二八三年期，多所教資會資助大學因應政府的策略方針，推出與人工智能相關的學士學位課程，例如：香港科技大學的「工學士（人工智能）」；香港大學的「文學士及工學學士（人工智能及數據科學）」。

至於自資專上界別，各院校可靈活開辦符合市場需要的課程，調整相關課程的內容及學額，回應社會不斷轉變的人力需求。在二○二四／二五學年，有10所自資院校開辦共15個與人工智能相關的專上課程。職業訓練局的香港資訊科技學院亦已於二○二四／二五學年開辦共21個課程，涵蓋網絡安全、人工智能、軟件工程等領域。

總而言之，教育局會繼續鼓勵學校運用創新科技，亦會密切留意這科技領域的應用與發展，加強與海內外夥伴交流合作，支持本地教育數字化的高質量發展。

多謝主席。"

The relevant provisions of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (6 of 2024), the Safeguarding National Security (Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Regulation and the Safeguarding National Security (Declaration of Prohibited Places) Order are also referred to. The updated contents have been uploaded to the dedicated website for public reference.

Since the promulgation and implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law (NSL) in 2020, all judicial decisions in national security cases are made public in an open and transparent manner. After publishing the English and Chinese versions of the Annotations in December 2023 and June 2024 respectively, the DoJ has been endeavouring to update the Annotations from time to time to keep the public informed of the latest developments of the NSL and the relevant laws, thereby enhancing public confidence in the laws on safeguarding national security, as well as raising public awareness of national security.

The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, said, ""The focus of national security education is to cultivate the self-awareness of the general public in safeguarding national security. To this end, we must deepen and strengthen the public's understanding of the laws on safeguarding national security and relevant rule of law principles to enhance confidence in and recognition of the laws on safeguarding national security amongst the public. The DoJ publishes, and from time to time updates, the Annotations to provide a simple and practical tool to assist the public in comprehending the relevant laws and cases"". Mr Lam expressed gratitude to Professor Albert Chen for continuing to serve as the Honorary Consultant Editor and offering valuable guidance on the work of the Annotations.

The DoJ will continue to update the Annotations from time to time for the public to understand the latest developments of relevant laws."
