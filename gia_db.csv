響應「世界肝炎日」　乙肝「早驗早處理」,2025-07-28 12:10,2025-07-28 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800298.htm,"衞生署今日（七月二十八日）表示，經過政府三十多年來的推動和努力，香港乙型肝炎（乙肝）感染率已大幅降低，並逐步邁向「無乙肝新一代」的目標。

每年七月二十八日為「世界肝炎日」，衞生署今年特別以「廿分之一係咪你乙肝早驗早處理」為口號，提醒市民若不確定是否患有慢性乙型肝炎，應及早進行測試。早發現、早治療可有效減低乙肝所引發的嚴重肝臟疾病的風險。

衞生署衞生防護中心公共衞生服務處特別預防計劃顧問醫生黃駿君醫生表示：「香港於七○年代的乙肝感染率高逾10%，自八○年代起，政府採取多項有效免費預防措施，包括為所有孕婦進行乙肝篩查、為患有乙肝的孕婦所生的嬰兒注射乙肝免疫球蛋白、自一九八八年起為所有新生嬰兒接種乙肝疫苗、近年增設向患有乙肝且病毒量高的孕婦提供抗病毒藥物，以及為母親是乙肝患者的嬰兒在接種乙肝疫苗後安排血清測試。現時，35歲以下年齡組別的乙肝感染率已少於1%，香港正邁向『無乙肝新一代』的目標。」

乙型肝炎可分急性或慢性，嚴重情況會引發肝衰竭、肝硬化或肝癌。衞生署根據2020-22年度人口健康調查的結果推算，全港整體人口仍有約5.6%（即約41萬人）患有慢性乙肝。調查發現35至84歲人士的乙肝感染率明顯較高，達7.8%，主要原因是於一九八八年前出生，未受惠於普及兒童乙肝疫苗接種計劃。調查亦發現，近四成患者沒有察覺自己患有慢性乙肝，並有約七成患者沒有接受任何跟進治療。慢性乙肝是一種終身感染，可以潛藏數以十年也不引起任何症狀，若沒有接受治療，約15%至40%的患者長遠會出現肝硬化和肝癌等嚴重肝臟疾病。肝癌是本港第三位致命癌症，每年約1 400人死於肝癌；而約八成肝癌新症患者患有慢性乙肝。

衞生署藉「世界肝炎日」呼籲所有香港市民關注慢性乙肝這個可以導致肝硬化及肝癌的「幕後黑手」。市民如不確定是否乙肝患者，特別是較高感染風險人士，例如不曾接種疫苗者、家庭成員（如父母、兄弟姊妹及子女）或性伴侶為慢性乙肝患者等，應及早進行測試，了解自己的身體狀況，並採取適切預防措施，包括接種乙肝疫苗。

乙肝測試除透過傳統靜脈抽血化驗外，現時亦可透過指尖採血快速測試，於15至30分鐘內獲得結果。乙肝測試於不同醫療機構均有提供，個別機構更設有流動檢測服務。市民如欲進行乙肝測試，可諮詢家庭醫生了解詳情及收費。

如確診患有慢性乙肝，應諮詢醫生的建議並定期接受跟進和檢查，以實踐「早驗早處理」。現今治療乙肝的抗病毒藥物能有效抑制病毒的複製，大大減低患者出現肝硬化和肝癌等併發症的風險。

另外，二○二四年《施政報告》提出在社區推行以風險為本的乙肝篩查，及早識別在社區的患者，並提供持續管理。基層醫療署正研究相關安排，詳情將適時公布。此外，政府今年內將公布《2025-2030年香港病毒性肝炎行動計劃》，制訂措施以進一步減輕病毒性肝炎的公共衞生負擔。

為加強公眾及醫護人員對肝炎風險的認知，衞生署和社區夥伴分別推出多項宣傳活動，以期將信息滲透不同人口群組，包括：

透過多元渠道宣傳健康資訊，例如報章專欄、電台訪談及社交媒體等；
於地區康健中心舉辦線上及實體健康講座；
於全港多區舉行流動健康推廣展覽；以及
由非政府組織（包括亞洲肝炎會、香港乙肝基金會、香港肝壽基金及香港肝臟移植協康會等）舉辦社區公眾教育活動，向市民講解乙型肝炎防治知識，提供快速測試及風險評估等服務。

DH appeals for early testing and management of hepatitis B in support of World Hepatitis Day,2025-07-28 12:10,2025-07-28 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800288.htm,"âThe Department of Health (DH) today (July 28) said that with the Government's promulgation and efforts over the past three decades, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Hong Kong has been significantly reduced and is moving progressively towards the goal of a ""hepatitis B-free generation"".

World Hepatitis Day is designated on July 28 every year. This year, the DH has adopted the slogan ""1 in 20: Test and Manage Hep B Early"" to remind members of the public to undergo testing early if they are uncertain whether they are having chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Early identification and management can effectively lower the risk of serious liver diseases caused by CHB.

  ""The prevalence of HBV infection in Hong Kong was over 10 per cent in the 1970s. Since the 1980s, the Government has implemented various effective and free preventive measures, including universal antenatal screening for hepatitis B, administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin for babies born to mothers with hepatitis B, universal neonatal hepatitis B vaccination since 1988, use of antivirals for pregnant women with CHB and high viral load, and post-vaccination serologic testing arranged for babies born to mothers with hepatitis B in recent years. Currently, the prevalence of HBV infection is less than 1 per cent among those under 35 years old. Hong Kong is moving towards the goal of a 'hepatitis B-free generation'"", said the Consultant (Special Preventive Programme) of the Public Health Services Branch of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH, Dr Bonnie Wong.

Hepatitis B infection can be acute or chronic. Severe cases of hepatitis B infection can lead to liver failure, cirrhosis or liver cancer. As derived from the findings of the Population Health Survey (PHS) 2020-22 conducted by the DH, about 5.6 per cent (about 410 000 people) of the Hong Kong population have CHB. The survey found that the prevalence of HBV infection among participants aged 35 to 84 was significantly higher at 7.8 per cent, mainly because those born before 1988 had not benefited from the universal childhood hepatitis B immunisation programme. The survey also found that nearly 40 per cent of people with CHB were not aware of their conditions and about 70 per cent of people with CHB did not receive any medical follow-up. CHB is a lifelong infection that often shows no symptoms for decades. Without treatment, about 15 to 40 per cent of the patients with CHB may develop serious liver diseases like cirrhosis or liver cancer in the long run. Liver cancer is Hong Kong's third leading cause of cancer deaths, which claimed around 1 400 lives every year. About 80 per cent of primary liver cancer patients have CHB.

The DH, in support of World Hepatitis Day, urges members of the public in Hong Kong to pay attention to CHB, which is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer. People who are not sure whether they have CHB, especially those at higher risk of infection, such as those who have not received vaccination, or whose family members (including parents, siblings and offspring) or sexual partners have CHB, are advised to undergo early testing to review their health condition and take appropriate preventive measures, including receiving hepatitis B vaccination.

Apart from the traditional venous blood sampling, rapid test for hepatitis B using blood drop from a finger-prick is also available and the result will be available in 15 to 30 minutes. Hepatitis B testing is available at different healthcare organisations, and some even offer mobile testing services. Members of the public may consult their family doctors for details and the charges if they wish to have hepatitis B testing.

If you are diagnosed with CHB, in line with the principle of ""test and manage early"", you should consult your doctor for advice and receive regular follow-ups and examinations. Current antiviral medications for hepatitis B can inhibit virus replication effectively and thereby greatly reduce the risk of complications such as cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Separately, the 2024 Policy Address announced a risk-based hepatitis B screening in the community for early identification of people with CHB in the community, and to provide subsequent management. The Primary Healthcare Commission is exploring the relevant arrangement and details will be announced in due course. In addition, the Government will announce the Hong Kong Viral Hepatitis Action Plan 2025-2030 within this year, to promulgate measures to further alleviate the public health burden of viral hepatitis.

To raise the public and healthcare workers' awareness of the risk of hepatitis, the DH and community partners have respectively launched a number of publicity campaigns to disseminate the messages to different population groups, including:

promoting health information through multiple channels, such as newspaper columns, radio interviews and social media;
organising online and physical health seminars in District Health Centres;
organising roving exhibitions on health promotions in various districts across the territory; and
organising community public education activities by non-governmental organisations (including Asiahep Hong Kong Limited, Hong Kong Hepatitis B Free Foundation, the Hong Kong Liver Foundation and the Hong Kong Liver Transplant Patients' Association) to educate the public on the prevention of hepatitis B, and provide services such as rapid testing and risk assessment.

  The TD has approved the taxi livery design and markings of the four fleets. For easy identification by passengers, all fleet taxis are required to display fleet taxi plates at the front and rear of the taxi bodies, and a fleet taxi certificate on the windscreens of the taxis.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""All fleets provide online hailing services. Passengers can book their journeys through the fleets' mobile applications or other online hailing channels. Fleets also provide customer service hotlines to handle passengers' enquiries and complaints. Further, all fleet taxis provide multiple electronic payment means, while safety devices including dash cameras, in-vehicle cameras and global navigation satellite systems as well as the driver monitoring system have been installed to provide convenience for passengers and ensure driving safety.""

  Fleet taxis may customise fares for pre-arranged journeys, charging a booking fee on top of the metered fare or charging a lump sum fare before the journey starts. Both must be agreed upon with the hirer in advance. The fares of fleet taxis may vary for pre-arranged journeys depending on the circumstances at the time of booking and the types of taxis requested by the passenger. For example, higher fares may be charged during peak hours or when the passenger requests a premium taxi. For street-hailing trips, fleet taxis shall charge according to the same fare schedule as general taxis.

  The TD has set up a taxi fleet thematic website. It also introduces information about the taxi fleet service to the public and tourists through various online and offline channels, including the TD's HKeMobility mobile application, and collaboration with the Hong Kong Tourism Board, the Airport Authority Hong Kong, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal operator and Hong Kong Talent Engage.

  In addition, the TD has set up about 80 designated fleet taxi stopping places across 13 locations, such as the airport, certain boundary control points, the Hong Kong West Kowloon Station of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, some Airport Express stations, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal and Hong Kong Disneyland. Information plates have been installed at these locations. The TD has also put up signage and display panels at some of these locations, and displayed online hailing QR codes via leaflets and posters for the public and tourists to make their bookings."

LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-28 11:30,2025-07-28 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800283.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

天氣酷熱　衞生署提醒市民預防高溫引發的疾病,2025-07-28 06:45,2025-07-28 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800015.htm,"天氣酷熱，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月二十八日）提醒市民，應採取適當措施預防高溫引發的疾病，例如熱痙攣、熱衰竭和中暑。

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-07-28 06:45,2025-07-28 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800013.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (July 28) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

Please broadcast the following as soon as possible:

The Hong Kong Observatory has issued the Very Hot Weather Warning.

To prevent heat stroke, avoid prolonged activities outdoors.

If engaged in outdoor work or activities, wear a wide-brimmed hat and light-coloured, loose-fitting clothes. Stay in shaded areas as much as possible.

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."

The spokesperson for the Hospital Authority (HA) has the following statement today (July 27) regarding an industrial accident at Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) redevelopment project construction site:

The redevelopment project of QMH is being carried out by the Architectural Services Department (ArchSD). This afternoon, the HA was notified by the ArchSD that a worker employed by a lift engineering subcontractor was trapped in one of the lift shafts during work. The site management of the contractor immediately called Fire Services Department to rescue the worker, who was then sent to the Accident and Emergency Department of QMH for emergency treatment. The worker was certified dead upon arrival at the Accident and Emergency Department.

The HA expresses deep sorrow over this incident and extends its sincere condolences to the deceased worker's family. The HA has directed the ArchSD to ensure that the contractor provides appropriate assistance to the family and supports them in handling the family member's after-death arrangements.

The HA is very concerned about the incident. Since the lifts involved in the project have not yet undergone all required works and adjustments, and have not been handed over for use and management by QMH. The HA is aware that site staff from the ArchSD immediately contacted and followed up with the contractor after the accident. The contractor has been urged to take the incident seriously and to adopt all necessary measures as soon as possible to ensure site safety. The contractor has also been requested to thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident and to submit a report to the ArchSD and the HA as soon as possible to prevent similar accidents from happening again.

The HA has always placed paramount importance on industrial safety at hospital construction sites. The HA notes that the contractor will report this incident to the Labour Department, and the HA will also urge the ArchSD and the contractor to fully co-operation with the Labour Department and other relevant enforcement agencies in their investigation."

HKSAR Government opposes smears against Police lawful enforcement actions,2025-07-27 16:46,2025-07-27 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/27/P2025072700516.htm,"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (July 27) strongly opposed and disapproved of smears with distorted facts by government officials and politicians from countries like the United States, Canada and Australia, as well as anti-China organisations, on HKSAR's lawful act to pursue wanted persons endangering national security absconding from Hong Kong. Not only did such foreign government officials and politicians, as well as anti-China organisations, turned a blind eye to illegal acts of criminals, but also deliberately smeared and spread irresponsible remarks, in an attempt to mislead the public, about the measures and actions taken by the HKSAR Government in accordance with the law. The HKSAR Government strongly disapproved of such acts.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""Acts and activities endangering national security could bring very serious consequences. Prompt actions must be taken to prevent and suppress such acts and activities effectively. According to Article 37 of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL), this Law shall apply to a person who is a permanent resident of the HKSAR or an incorporated or unincorporated body such as a company or an organisation which is set up in the HKSAR if the person or the body commits an offence under the HKNSL outside the HKSAR. Additionally, Article 38 of the HKNSL stipulates that this Law shall apply to offences under this Law committed against the HSKAR from outside the HKSAR by a person who is not a permanent resident of the HKSAR. Therefore, the Hong Kong Police Force has the responsibility to pursue, in accordance with the law, persons suspected of committing offences under the HKNSL outside Hong Kong.""

""The 'Hong Kong Parliament' is an organisation which aims to subvert state power; its objectives include promoting 'self-determination', promulgating the so-called 'Hong Kong Constitution', and overthrowing or undermining the basic system of the People's Republic of China established by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China or overthrowing the body of the central power of People's Republic of China or the body of power of the HKSAR with unlawful means, thereby suspected of having committed the offence of 'Subversion' contrary to Article 22 of the HKNSL. Thus, Police applied to the court for arrest warrants in accordance with the law and put the persons involved on wanted list. Any acts disregarding the facts and smearing HKSAR's work in safeguarding national security with untruthful remarks are hypocritical and irresponsible, and will not win any public support.""

""We have to stress that both the HKNSL and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR. The rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press and of publication, and the freedoms of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, enjoyed by Hong Kong people under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applicable to the HKSAR are protected in accordance with the law. However, regarding an extremely small minority of organisations and individuals endangering national security, the HKSAR Government will not condone their criminal acts, and will not give up pursuing them, including adopting all practical measures to bring those fugitives endangering national security who have absconded from Hong Kong to justice.""

The spokesman emphasised, ""Absconders should not think they can evade criminal liability by absconding from Hong Kong. Ultimately, they will be liable for their acts constituting serious offences endangering national security and be punished by the law. No country or organisation should harbour criminals nor try to exonerate these people with different excuses.""

""The Constitution and the Basic Law steadfastly safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people. Any attempt by foreign countries or external forces to undermine Hong Kong's situation will only expose their own weakness and faulty arguments and be doomed to fail. The HKSAR Government will continue to unwaveringly discharge its duty in safeguarding national security,"" the spokesman reiterated."
特區政府反對抹黑警方依法執法行動言論,2025-07-27 16:30,2025-07-27 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/27/P2025072700500.htm,"​特區政府今日（七月二十七日）強烈反對和不滿美國、加拿大、澳洲等地的官員政客、以及反華組織等歪曲事實，抹黑特區依法緝捕潛逃境外危害國家安全分子的行動。有關外國官員、政客及反華組織不但漠視該等不法分子的犯罪行為，更刻意抹黑特區政府依法採取的措施及行動，並發表不負責任言論，試圖混淆視聽，特區政府對此表示強烈不滿。

特區政府發言人表示：「危害國家安全的行為和活動會引起極其嚴重的後果，必須及時採取行動，有效防範和制止。根據《香港國安法》第三十七條，《香港國安法》適用於在特區以外地方干犯《香港國安法》下罪行的特區永久性居民，及在特區成立的公司及團體等法人及非法人組織。此外，《香港國安法》第三十八條訂明，《香港國安法》亦適用於不具有香港特區永久性居民身份但針對特區實施犯罪的人。因此，香港警方有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌干犯《香港國安法》罪行的人。」

「『香港議會』是一個旨在顛覆國家政權的組織，其目標包括推動『自決』、制定所謂『香港憲法』，以非法手段推翻、破壞《中華人民共和國憲法》所確立的中華人民共和國根本制度或推翻中華人民共和國中央政權機關或者特區政權機關等，涉嫌干犯《香港國安法》第二十二條『顛覆國家政權罪』，警方遂依法向法院申請拘捕令，並通緝有關人士。任何妄顧事實而以失實言論抹黑香港特區維護國家安全工作的都是偽善和不負責任的行為，不得人心。」

「我們必須強調，《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》均明確規定維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，亦依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》，以及《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港特區的有關規定下享有的權利和自由，包括言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會、遊行、示威等自由。不過，針對極少部分危害國家安全的組織和個人，特區政府對其犯罪行為絕不姑息，一定追究到底，並採取一切可行方法緝捕潛逃境外危害國家安全的人士。」

發言人強調：「潛逃者不要妄想潛逃離港就可以逃避刑責。他們最終都需要為其危害國家安全的嚴重犯罪行為負上責任，受到法律制裁。任何國家或組織亦不應包庇犯罪分子，或以不同藉口嘗試為這些人開脫。」

發言人重申：「香港居民的人權和自由受《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實保障。任何外國或外部勢力企圖詆毀香港情況，只會理屈詞窮，絕不會得逞。特區政府定當繼續堅定履職，維護國家安全。」"
