立法會九題：資助出售房屋的轉讓限制措施,2025-07-02 15:10,2025-07-02 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200384.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）立法會會議上梁文廣議員的提問和署理房屋局局長戴尚誠的書面答覆：

問題：

資助出售房屋（例如香港房屋委員會（房委會）的居者有其屋計劃（居屋）及綠表置居計劃（綠置居），以及香港房屋協會（房協）的資助出售房屋項目）旨在為低至中收入家庭提供可負擔的住房，而房委會及房協多年來透過設立轉讓限制及要求支付補價等措施，確保有關資源得以有效運用，供有需要人士置業。關於資助出售房屋的轉讓限制措施，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去十年就每項由房委會及房協推出的資助出售房屋計劃，每年（a）經補地價及（b）未補地價而轉售的單位總數為何，並按（i）該等單位的樓齡分布（即五年內、五年至十年，以及十年以上），以及（ii）其成交價格分布（即一百萬元以下、一百萬元至二百萬元、二百萬元至三百萬元、三百萬元至五百萬元、五百萬元至七百萬元，以及七百萬元以上）列出分項數字；

（二）現時有多少個居屋單位已屆滿轉讓限制期，並可申請補價轉售，以及當中已補價並已轉售單位的比例為何；

（三）現時在購入後從未轉售的居屋單位數目及其佔所有居屋單位數目的百分比為何，並按單位樓齡列出分項資料；及

（四）政府會否研究在未來的居屋及綠置居項目中，禁止單位補價後於私人市場轉售，並改為僅可在二手居屋市場交易；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就梁文廣議員的提問，我們現回覆如下：

（一）香港房屋委員會（房委會）一直致力完善房屋階梯，透過出售資助出售單位協助中低收入家庭自置居所。在未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），房委會和香港房屋協會（房協）將會有約56500個資助出售單位落成，我們相信有關單位定能協助有需要的人士實現置業夢想。我們亦鼓勵市民按自己的能力選擇合適的房屋階梯上流。

房委會除了出售一手資助出售單位，亦容許資助出售單位的業主在無需補價的情況下可在居者有其屋（居屋）第二市場出售單位，或在補價後在公開市場出售、出租或以其他方式轉讓單位。業主在購買時所享有的折扣率，也是解除轉讓限制時計算補價的基礎。

另一方面，房協出售的資助出售單位在補價前亦受轉讓限制約束。房協於一九九七年設立「住宅發售計劃」第二市場，房協相關項目單位的業主，按照各自項目的相關地契條款，於滿足指定的購入年期後和無須補地價的情況下，可將單位轉售予合資格的人士。

由於已補價單位屬私有化單位，房委會及房協皆不掌握有關單位是否已轉售，亦沒有備存已補價的資助出售單位在公開市場的轉讓交易數字。

過去十年，房委會居屋及綠表置居計劃（綠置居）單位在居屋第二市場的交易數目見附件一，交易總數約為21 200宗。事實上，房委會一直以來透過不同的措施鼓勵資助出售單位在第二市場流轉，當中包括於二○二四年放寬資助出售單位的按揭貸款安排，將第二市場的按揭貸款保證期由三十年延長至五十年，讓買家可獲得年期更長的按揭貸款。在有關安排落實後的十二個月，二手資助出售單位平均每月成交宗數約370宗，比落實前十二個月（即二○二三年三月至二○二四年二月）的平均每月成交宗數約230宗，顯著上升約六成。房委會居屋單位於二○二四年在居屋第二市場的交易總數約3380宗，比二○一五年的交易總數約1320宗，上升約1.6倍。

過去十年，房協資助出售房屋每年未補價在「住宅發售計劃」第二市場轉售的單位交易數目見附件二。

（二）截至二○二五年第一季，房委會約有32萬個居屋單位已屆滿轉讓限期並可於補價後在公開市場出售。此類單位中，已補價單位的佔比為19%。

截至二○二五年第一季，房協約有2.2萬個資助出售房屋單位已屆滿轉讓限制期而符合資格於補價後在公開市場出售。此類單位中，已補價單位的佔比為22%。

（三）截至二○二五年第一季，房委會約有23萬個未補價及未經轉售的居屋單位，按樓齡及比例劃分的數字詳見附件三。

截至二○二五年第一季，房協約有1.5萬個未補價及從未轉售的資助出售單位，按樓齡及比例劃分的數字詳見附件四。

（四）為有效防止短期投機活動，房委會於二○二二年一月收緊居屋和綠置居單位的轉讓限制。第二市場無須補價以不高於原價轉售的期限，已由首次轉讓日期起計兩年延長至五年；於公開市場在繳付補價後出售單位的期限，亦已由首次轉讓日期起計十年延長至十五年。房協於二○二四年或以後落成的資助出售單位亦採納房委會上述的轉讓限制。

容許居屋和綠置居業主在禁售期後出售其單位，一方面能促進二手資助出售單位的流轉，為市場增加供應，另一方面亦為業主提供在房屋階梯轉投私人住宅市場的機會，是一個協助資助房屋業主上進上流，加強社會動力的措施。"
LCQ9: Measures on alienation restrictions for subsidised sale housing,2025-07-02 15:10,2025-07-02 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200388.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Leung Man-kwong and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Housing, Mr Victor Tai, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 Subsidised sale housing (e.g. the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) and the Green Form Subsidized Home Ownership Scheme (GHS) of the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) as well as the Subsidised Sale Flats Project of the Hong Kong Housing Society (HS)) aim at offering affordable housing to low to middle-income families, whereas HA and HS have, over the years, adopted measures such as imposing alienation restrictions and requiring premium payment to ensure the efficient use of the relevant resources for people in need to acquire their homes. Regarding the measures on alienation restrictions for subsidised sale housing, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) in respect of each subsidised sale housing scheme launched by HA and HS in each of the past 10 years, of the total number of flats resold with premium (a) paid and (b) unpaid, together with a breakdown of such flats by (i) age distribution (i.e. within five years, between five to 10 ‍years and over 10 years), and (ii) distribution of transaction prices (i.e. less than $1 million, $1 million to $2 million, $2 million to $3 ‍million, $3 million to $5 million, $5 million to $7 million, and over $7 million);

(2) of the current number of HOS flats which the alienation restriction period has expired and are eligible for application for resale upon payment of premium, and among them, the proportion of flats which have been resold with premium paid;

(3) of the current number of HOS flats which have never been resold after purchase and its percentage in the total number of HOS flats, together with a breakdown by age of the flats; and

(4) whether the Government will study prohibiting the resale of flats in the private market upon payment of premium in the future HOS and GHS projects, and changing to allow transactions in the secondary market of HOS flats only; if not, of the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 In response to the questions raised by the Hon Leung Man-kwong, our reply is as follows:

(1) The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has all along been striving to enhance the housing ladder, with a view to helping low to middle-income families achieve home ownership through the sale of subsidised sale flats (SSF). In the next five years (i.e. from 2025/26 to 2029/30), the HA and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) will have a completion of about 56 500 SSF. We believe that the relevant flats can facilitate people in need to achieve their dream of home ownership. We also encourage members of the public to move up the suitable housing ladder according to their own ability.

 In addition to sale of first-hand SSF, the HA also allows SSF owners to sell their flats with premium unpaid in the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) Secondary Market, or to sell, let or otherwise assign their flats in other ways in the open market after payment of premium. The discount rate that HOS owners enjoyed in purchasing their flats will form the basis for premium assessment for removal of the alienation restrictions.

 On the other hand, the HKHS' SSF with premium unpaid are also subject to alienation restrictions. In 1997, the HKHS launched the Flat-For-Sale Scheme (FFSS) Secondary Market, enabling flat owners under HKHS' relevant projects to resell their flats to eligible persons with premium unpaid, subject to the conditions in the respective land lease and provided that such owners have fulfilled the designated ownership period since the date of first assignment.

 Since flats with payment of premium are regarded as private units, the HA and the HKHS do not hold the information on whether relevant flats have been resold, and do not maintain transaction figures of SSF for which premium has been paid in the open market.

 The numbers of transactions of HA's HOS and Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme (GSH) flats in the HOS Secondary Market in the past 10 years are set out in Annex 1. The total number of transactions amounted to about 21 200.In fact, the HA has all along encouraged the circulation of SSF in the Secondary Market through various initiatives, including the relaxation of the mortgage arrangements for SSF in 2024 to extend the maximum mortgage default guarantee period for the secondary market from 30 years to 50 years, so that buyers can secure mortgage loans of a longer tenor. In the 12 months after the implementation of relevant arrangements, the average number of transactions of second-hand SSF was about 370 per month, which was about 60 per cent higher than the average number of transactions of about 230 per month in the 12 months before the implementation (i.e. from March 2023 to February 2024), representing a significant increase. The total number of transactions of HOS flats in the HA's Secondary Market in 2024 was 3 380, representing an increase of about 1.6 times as compared with the total number of transactions of about 1 320 in 2015.

 The numbers of transactions of HKHS' SSF flats without payment of premium in the FFSS Secondary Market in the past 10 years are set out by year in Annex 2.

(2)As at the first quarter of2025, the HA had about 320 000 HOS flats of which the alienation period has expired, which can be resold in the open market after payment of premium. Among them, 19 per cent of the flats have been paid with premium.

 As at the first quarter of2025, the HKHS had about 22 000 SSF flats of which the alienation restriction period has expired and can be resold in the open market upon payment of premium. Among them, 22 per cent of the flats have been paid with premium.

(3) As at the first quarter of2025, the HA has about 230 000 HOS flats with premium not yet paid and have not been resold. For details of the figures categorised by building age and proportion, please see Annex 3.

 As at the first quarter of2025, HKHS has about 15 000 SSF flats with premium not yet paid and have never been resold. For details of the figures categorised by building age and proportion, please see Annex 4.

(4) In order to effectively curb short-term speculative activities, the HA tightened the alienation restrictions of HOS and GSH flats in January 2022. The period where the owners can only sell at no more than the original price in the Secondary Market with premium unpaid has been lengthened from the first two years since first assignment to the first five years since first assignment; while the restriction period for sale in the open market after payment of premium has also been lengthened from the first 10 years since first assignment to the first 15 years since first assignment.All HKHS SSF developments completed in 2024 or beyond also adopt the aforementioned tightened alienation restrictions introduced by the HA in 2022.

 Allowing HOS and GSH flat owners to sell their flats after the restriction period can facilitate the circulation of second-hand SSF, thereby increasing SSF supply in the market. On the other hand, this measure provides opportunities for owners to move on to the private property market on the housing ladder, which is an initiative to encourage owners' upward mobility and strengthen social's mobility."
LCQ16: Improving English information channels,2025-07-02 15:00,2025-07-02 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200400.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Starry Lee and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Dr Bernard Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 The Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC Central Committee) has adopted the Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on Further Deepening Reform Comprehensively to Advance Chinese Modernization, in which it is pointed out that Hong Kong needs to further capitalise on its strengths and become an international hub for high-calibre talents. There are views that attracting international talents requires efforts on various fronts, among which, the creation of an international living environment and the setting up of well-established English information channels for demonstration of Hong Kong's cultural diversity, openness and inclusiveness are particularly important. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the percentage of broadcast time in foreign languages out of the total broadcast time in respect of the public broadcasting services in Hong Kong at present, and how the relevant time and percentage compare with those in other international metropolises;

(2) of the specific policies and whether resources have been allocated to encourage local television and sound broadcasters to produce more quality English-language programmes, especially those with contents showcasing the business environment, cultural characteristics, lifestyle, etc, in Hong Kong;

(3) whether it has evaluated the effectiveness of the existing English media contents in attracting and retaining international talents; whether it has conducted relevant surveys to understand the information needs of international talents;

(4) whether it will consider setting up an additional 24-hour English channel on Radio Television Hong Kong and producing more English programmes to present a soft and down-to-earth introduction of the policies and development opportunities in Hong Kong, so as to enable international talents and inbound tourists to obtain local information more conveniently; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(5) of the Government's plans to enhance Hong Kong's international image and visibility by arranging additional media coverage in English, given that the 15th National Games and other international events are about to take place; and

(6) apart from traditional television broadcasters, whether it has plans to make use of emerging publicity channels, such as digital platforms and social media, to produce more information contents about Hong Kong in English, so as to strengthen Hong Kong's international communication capability, thereby creating a more attractive international living environment; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The HKSAR Government has been striving to showcase the unique characteristics of Hong Kong, being an international metropolis, from various perspectives to attract international talents and tourists by telling the good stories of Hong Kong through diverse television and radio programmes, as well as different promotion measures. Having consulted the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB), the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) and the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, our consolidated response is as follows:

 Hong Kong's broadcasting market is under steady development. The three domestic free television programme service (free TV) licensees, two sound broadcasting licensees and Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) are providing a total of 15 television channels and 14 radio channels respectively, which include five TV channels and three radio channels in English. The general public (including non-Chinese-speaking persons in Hong Kong) can choose and enjoy diverse television and radio programmes (including English-language programmes) with a wide variety according to their needs. The HKSAR Government does not maintain related information in other regions.

 Under the current broadcasting regulatory framework, licensed broadcasters shall provide English programmes through their designated English channels in accordance with their licence conditions. Considering the sustainable development of licensed broadcasters and the needs of different audience, the three domestic free TV English channels are currently required to broadcast English programmes for at least 55 per cent of the broadcasting hours. Although licensed broadcasters can exercise suitable flexibility to broadcast non-English programmes for not more than 45 per cent of the broadcasting hours on their English channels, free TV licensees must broadcast English programmes during prime time on their English channels as required to cater for the needs of the general public and non-Chinese-speaking persons in Hong Kong. We also note that the current English programmes offered by licensed broadcasters cover a wide range of genres, including news, current affairs, sports, cultural features, lifestyle and arts, etc.

 On the other hand, RTHK also proactively offers English programmes through its radio and TV channels, including launching English programme time slots on RTHK TV 31 and 32; providing 24-hour relay of the China Global Television Network Documentary and English Channels under the China Media Group on RTHK TV 34 and 35; providing 24-hour broadcasting with diverse English programmes on RTHK Radio 3; and broadcasting bilingual programmes featuring fine music and arts information on RTHK Radio 4, etc. These help exhibit Hong Kong's diversity and global vision, proactively telling good stories of the country and Hong Kong and enabling non-Chinese speaking persons in Hong Kong to have a better understanding of various information about Hong Kong and Mainland China.

 Since the three free TV licences will expire in 2027 and 2028, the Communications Authority (CA) has commenced the renewal exercise of the free TV licences and will conduct a public consultation exercise in the third quarter of 2025. In processing the renewal applications, subject to actual circumstances, the CA will consider revisions to licence conditions and regulatory requirements on free TV services (including requirements on English channels and programmes) taking into account views from the industry and the public as well as the latest market development and submit recommendations on licence renewal to the Chief Executive in Council.

 Regarding the attraction of talents, talents are generally concerned about employment and business start-up opportunities, children's education and social integration when considering pursuance of development in Hong Kong. Media in English, being an international language, helps disseminate relevant information to international talents, alleviating their concern about integration into local society. To facilitate social integration of international talents in a more proactive manner, the Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE) of the LWB has been providing comprehensive support services to help them stay in the city for development. With a view to ensuring that the comprehensive information about living and working in Hong Kong are accessible to international talents, the HKTE's promotional and publicity materials, including its online platform, TV Announcements in the Public Interest, social media posts, etc, are already fully available in English, and its themed seminars on living in Hong Kong also offer online livestreaming and simultaneous interpretation services. On the other hand, the HKTE launched the Talent+ Volunteer Programme in September 2024, and has been collaborating with various non-governmental organisations, working partners and corporations to provide incoming talents with diverse volunteer service opportunities, strengthening their connections with the local community and fostering their sense of belonging to the city.

 As for promotion of mega events, the CSTB, in collaboration with relevant government departments and organisations, has been devising extensive publicity campaigns through diverse means for the 15th National Games (NG), the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities (NGD) and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NSOG), including various overseas promotional initiatives with the support of the Information Services Department (ISD), such as running advertisements in overseas media and at a number of major overseas international airports, engaging overseas key opinion leaders to publish promotional posts, and inviting overseas journalists and guests to visit Hong Kong through thematic media visit programmes and the Sponsored Visitors Programme so that they can spread their positive visiting experiences in their hometown afterwards, with a view to raising the international profile and popularity of Hong Kong and attracting more overseas spectators to the events. RTHK will also fully engage in the promotion, production and live broadcast of the 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG. Besides, for organisation of major events, depending on the nature of the events, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) will invite media in English and other foreign languages to participate in press conferences or carry out promotional campaigns, and will also collaborate with local and international media organisations and event partners (such as relevant Consulates-General in Hong Kong, cultural organisations stationed in Hong Kong as well as the overseas Economic and Trade Offices) to promote the events. The LCSD will make good use of its social media platforms for promotion and support bilingual content so as to promote featured events to local and overseas audiences.

 Apart from the above promotion measures, the ISD has been setting up accounts on various social media platforms and producing more English social media posts for promotion. The ISD has also co-operated with the national media to make use of their multi-language new media platforms to promote Hong Kong to more countries through different foreign languages. Besides, the ISD will continue to work with suitable overseas media organisations to produce content on Hong Kong's latest development in key areas, such as innovation and technology, sports, shipping, and culture and arts, etc, with the aim of expanding the reach of overseas promotional efforts through their readers' network and social media platforms. Through monitoring of the latest market development and global trend, the ISD will continue to make use of appropriate platforms to raise the international profile of Hong Kong."
LCQ7: Improving Mandatory Provident Fund system,2025-07-02 15:00,2025-07-02 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200351.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Wendy Hong and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 This year marks the 25th anniversary of the implementation of the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) system. According to statistics from the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority, the total MPF assets amounted to around $1,340 billion as at the end of March this year. On improving the MPF system, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of MPF scheme members and their average MPF asset levels in each of the past five years, and set out in the table below with a breakdown by age group (i.e. (i) below 25, (ii) between 25 and below 30, (iii) between 35 and below 45, (iv) between 45 and below 55, (v) between 55 and below 65, and (vi) 65 or above), and MPF asset levels (i.e. (a) $200,000 or below, (b) between $200,001 and $400,000, (c) between $400,001 and $600,000, (d) between $600,001 and $800,000, (e) between $800,001 and $1,000,000, (f) between $1,000,001 and $1,500,000, (g) between $1,500,001 and $2,000,000, and (h) above $2,000,000);

(2) as the Government indicated in its reply to a question from a Member of this Council on May 7 this year that allowing members of the public to make early withdrawals of their accrued benefits to meet home ownership needs would result in such accrued benefits leaking from the system and failing to accumulate for growth in value, thereby undermining the integrity of the MPF system, but there are views that the Government may consider allowing members of the public to borrow the accrued benefits from their MPF accounts to fund a down payment on their first home, with repayment made in instalments over the mortgage term of the purchased property and all outstanding amounts in the MPF account to be repaid immediately upon the sale of the property, which will create a closed-loop funding mechanism to prevent funds from flowing out of the owner-occupied property market or MPF accounts, thereby maximising the value of MPF in supporting people's retirement, whether the government will consider the aforesaid proposal; and

(3) given that Hong Kong is about to become a super-aged society, whether the Government will consider emulating the provident fund systems of the Mainland and Singapore by setting up designated contribution accounts targeting areas such as healthcare and housing under the MPF system in the long term, and increasing the income ratio for MPF contributions to help members of the public to cope with various expenses after retirement?

Reply:

President,

 In consultation with the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA), the reply to the three parts of the question is as follows:

(1) As at end-2024, about 4.8 million Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) scheme members held a total of around 11.2 million MPF accounts of various types (including contribution accounts, personal accounts and tax-deductible voluntary contribution accounts), hence each scheme member held more than 2.3 MPF accounts on average. The number of MPF scheme members and accounts over the past five years, the average amount of accrued benefits per MPF account by the age group of scheme members, and the number of accounts by the amount of accrued benefits are tabulated below:

 As each scheme member may hold more than one account, and the accounts may be held under different MPF schemes, figures on the number of scheme members by their total accrued benefits are not available at present. MPF schemes are gradually onboarding to the eMPF Platform, which commenced operation in June 2024. Upon completion of onboarding of all MPF schemes, data relating to total MPF accrued benefits by individual scheme members could be compiled via the eMPF Platform.

(2) The MPF system is set up to assist the public to save up for their retirement. The idea of allowing scheme members to borrow their MPF benefits for the purpose of home ownership must take into consideration the impact on scheme members' retirement savings. MPF is a long-term investment with compounding effect, designed to allow MPF benefits to accumulate steadily and be kept in the accounts for value growth during the working life of scheme members. Therefore, accrued benefits should be preserved as far as possible and only be withdrawn and used upon retirement of the employed persons. If we were to relax the preservation requirement on MPF benefits and allow scheme members to borrow their MPF benefits to meet home ownership needs, the accrued benefits would fail to accumulate for value growth, thereby reducing scheme members' MPF benefits meant for their retirement and undermining the basic retirement protection for the working population. Furthermore, as the MPF system has the advantage of diversifying investment risks, investments in real estate bear higher risks than those in MPF funds in general. The arrangements requiring members of the public to repay in instalments after borrowing MPF benefits for home ownership purpose and make repayment with the proceeds from the sale of the property of which the down payment was met by MPF benefits also entail considerable complexity.

(3) Under the MPF system, employers and employees are currently required to respectively make mandatory contributions equivalent to 5 per cent of the employee's relevant income (with the current monthly contribution cap at $1,500). If the MPF system were to save up for medical and home ownership expenses at the same time without affecting the retirement protection for employed persons, we must consider increasing the overall MPF contribution rate. Drawing on practices in regions outside Hong Kong (such as the Mainland and Singapore), should dedicated savings accounts be set up to cover medical and home ownership expenses, the contribution rate to the relevant accounts could be as high as over 30 per cent of the employee's income. Given that the current total mandatory contribution rate stands at only 10 per cent, the proposal of introducing dedicated savings accounts for medical and home ownership purposes under the MPF system and raising the total MPF contribution rate must first reach a broad societal consensus.

 The Government and the MPFA welcome views regarding the MPF system from various sectors, and will carefully assess the necessity and feasibility of each proposal to continuously improve the operation of the MPF system without compromising the basic retirement protection for scheme members."
Online auction of vehicle registration marks to be held from July 17 to 21,2025-07-02 15:00,2025-07-02 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200348.htm,"The Transport Department (TD) today (July 2) said that the next online auction of vehicle registration marks (VRMs) will be held from noon on July 17 (Thursday) to noon on July 21 (Monday) through the auction platform E-Auction (e-auction.td.gov.hk).

立法會七題：優化強制性公積金制度,2025-07-02 15:00,2025-07-02 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200345.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上洪雯議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

今年是強制性公積金（強積金）制度實施25周年。根據強制性公積金計劃管理局的資料，截至本年三月底，強積金總資產值約為1.34萬億。關於優化強積金制度，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年強積金計劃成員的數目及其平均強積金資產水平為何，並按年齡組別（即（i）25歲以下、（ii）25歲至35歲以下、（iii）35歲至45歲以下、（iv）45歲至55歲以下、（v）55歲至65歲以下，及（vi）65歲或以上），以及強積金資產水平（即（a）200,000元或以下、（b）200,001元至400,000元、（c）400,001元至600,000元、（d）600,001元至800,000元、（e）800,001元至1,000,000元、（f）1,000,001元至1,500,000元、（g）1,500,001元至2,000,000元，以及（ｈ）2,000,000元以上）以下表列出分項資料；

（二）鑑於政府於本年五月七日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，容許市民提早提取強積金累算權益以滿足置業需要，會令累算權益流失並失去滾存增值的機會，削弱強積金制度的完整性，但有意見認為，政府可考慮允許市民以借用形式將其強積金帳戶的累算權益用作首次置業的首期，隨後再按其所購物業的按揭年期分期償還，並在有關物業出售時立即償還所有強積金帳戶的未償還款項，以實現資金閉環，防止資金流出自住物業市場或強積金帳戶以外，從而最大程度發揮強積金在支援市民養老方面的價值，政府會否研究上述方案；及

（三）鑑於香港即將進入超老齡化社會，政府會否研究，仿效內地和新加坡的公積金制度，長遠在強積金制度下增設針對醫療、住屋等範疇的專項供款帳戶，並提升強積金供款的入息比率，協助市民應對退休後的各項開支？

答覆：

主席：

就問題的三個部分，經諮詢強制性公積金計劃管理局（積金局）後，現回覆如下：

（一）截至二○二四年底，約480萬名強制性公積金（強積金）計劃成員共持有約1 120萬個不同類型的強積金帳戶（包括供款帳戶、個人帳戶和可扣稅自願性供款帳戶），即每位計劃成員平均持有多於2.3個強積金帳戶。過去五年強積金計劃成員和帳戶的數目、按計劃成員年齡組別劃分每個強積金帳戶的平均累算權益金額，以及按累算權益金額劃分的帳戶數目表列如下：

由於計劃成員可持有多於一個帳戶，而有關帳戶或會分散於不同強積金計劃，因此現時未能提供按總累算權益劃分的計劃成員數目。積金易平台已於二○二四年六月開始運作，各強積金計劃正陸續加入積金易平台，待所有計劃加入平台後，便可以透過積金易平台編制有關個人強積金總累算權益的資料。

（二）設立強積金制度旨在協助市民為退休作儲蓄，有關容許計劃成員借出其強積金權益作置業用途的構思，必須顧及措施對計劃成員退休儲備造成的影響。強積金屬於長線投資，並具有複息效應的特點，其設計原意在於讓強積金權益在計劃成員的工作生涯中不斷滾存增值，達至積少成多的效果，故此應盡量保存至就業人士退休時才可提取使用。如果我們放寬保存強積金權益的要求，容許計劃成員借出以滿足置業需要，會使其失去滾存增值的機會，令計劃成員用作退休儲備的強積金權益相應減少，削弱勞動人口的基本退休保障。此外，由於強積金制度有分散投資風險的優勢，房地產投資的風險一般較強積金基金投資為高。有關要求市民於借出強積金權益作置業用途後分期還款，以及售出以強積金權益支付首期的樓宇後用所得款項償還借款的安排亦具相當複雜性。

（三）在強積金制度下，僱主和僱員現時須分別作出僱員有關入息百分之五的強制性供款（每月供款上限現為1,500元）。假如強積金制度要同時為醫療或置業開支作儲蓄，在不影響就業人士退休保障的前提下，我們必須要考慮提升強積金總供款率。參考香港以外地區（例如內地及新加坡）的做法，若要設立專項儲蓄帳戶以滿足醫療和置業開支，相關帳戶所作的供款佔僱員薪酬的比率高達百分之三十以上。在目前強制性總供款率只有百分之十的情況下，有關在強積金制度增設醫療或置業專項儲蓄帳戶，並提升強積金總供款率的建議，必須先取得社會廣泛共識。

政府和積金局歡迎各界就強積金制度提出意見，並會審慎評估各項建議的必要性和可行性，在不削弱計劃成員基本退休保障的前提下持續完善強積金制度的運作。"
立法會十六題：完善英語資訊渠道,2025-07-02 15:00,2025-07-02 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200402.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上李慧琼議員的提問和署理商務及經濟發展局局長陳百里博士的書面答覆：

問題：

中國共產黨第二十屆中央委員會第三次全體會議通過的《中共中央關於進一步全面深化改革、推進中國式現代化的決定》指出，香港需要進一步發揮優勢，打造成為國際高端人才集聚高地。有意見認為吸引國際人才需要多方面努力，其中營造國際化的生活環境，以及透過完善的英語資訊渠道展示香港的多元文化特色和開放包容精神尤為重要。就此，政府可否告知本會：

答覆：

主席︰

香港作為國際大都會，特區政府一直致力從多角度展現香港特色，吸引國際人才及旅客來港，其中包括透過多元化的電視及電台節目和不同的宣傳措施，說好香港故事。經諮詢勞工及福利局（勞福局）、文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）及民政及青年事務局，現綜合回覆如下：

香港的廣播市場發展穩健。三家本地免費電視節目服務（免費電視）牌照持有人、兩家聲音廣播牌照持有人和香港電台（港台）合共提供分別15條電視頻道及14條電台頻道，其中包括五條英語電視頻道和三條英語電台頻道。市民大眾（包括在港非華語人士）能按需要選擇及享受多元化且種類繁多的電視及電台節目（包括英語節目）。特區政府並無備存其他地區的相關資料。

在現行的廣播規管制度下，持牌廣播機構必須按照其牌照要求透過英語頻道提供英語節目。考慮到持牌廣播機構的可持續發展及不同觀眾的需要，現時三家本地免費電視的英語頻道須廣播英語節目的時間至少為55%。雖然現時持牌廣播機構有適當彈性選擇在英語頻道播放不多於45%的其他非英語的節目，但免費電視持牌機構必須按規定在其英語頻道的黃金時段播放英語節目，以滿足市民及在港非華語人士的需要。我們亦留意到現時持牌廣播機構的英語節目種類涵蓋新聞、時事、體育、文化特色及生活藝術等不同範疇。

另一方面，港台亦積極透過其電台及電視頻道提供英語節目，包括於港台電視31及港台電視32增設英語節目時段、透過港台電視34及港台電視35全日24小時轉播中央廣播電視總台旗下中國環球電視網的紀錄頻道和英語頻道、香港電台第三台提供24小時廣播及多元化的英文節目，以及香港電台第四台以雙語播放「美樂及藝術資訊」內容的節目等，呈現香港的多元性及國際視野，積極說好國家和香港故事，讓在港非華語人士能了解更多香港和內地的不同資訊。

鑑於三個免費電視牌照有效期將於二○二七年及二○二八年屆滿，通訊事務管理局（通訊局）已展開免費電視牌照的續期程序，並會在今年第三季展開公眾諮詢。在處理續期申請時，通訊局亦會因應業界和公眾的意見及市場的最新發展，按實際情況考慮可作修訂的牌照條件及其他有關免費電視服務的規管安排（包括對英語頻道和節目的要求），然後向行政長官會同行政會議就牌照續期提交建議。

吸引人才方面，人才來港發展普遍考慮就業與創業機會、子女教育及融入本地生活的情況。英語作為國際語言，英語媒體有助向國際人才發放相關資訊，在一定程度上釋除他們對融入本地社會的憂慮。為了更積極協助國際人才融入香港，勞福局轄下的香港人才服務辦公室（人才辦）一直致力為他們提供全方位的支援服務，協助他們留港發展。人才辦的線上平台、電視宣傳短片、社交媒體平台帖文等宣傳推廣資料已全面提供英文版本，而有關在港生活的主題研討會亦提供網上直播及即時傳譯服務，確保國際人才能夠得到在港生活及工作的全方位資訊。人才辦亦已於二○二四年九月推出人才義工計劃，聯繫不同非政府機構、合作夥伴及企業，為來港人才提供多元化的義工服務機會，加強他們與本地社區的連繫及對香港的歸屬感。

推廣盛事方面，文體旅局正聯同各政府部門及相關機構透過多元化渠道為第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會）進行廣泛推廣工作，包括在政府新聞處（新聞處）的協助下於海外進行各種宣傳，例如於海外媒體和多個海外主要國際機場投放廣告、與海外關鍵意見領袖合作發布帖文，以及透過專題採訪計劃和貴賓訪港計劃邀請海外媒體和貴賓到訪香港後向其地區宣傳正面的訪港經驗等，以提升香港的國際形象與知名度，吸引更多旅客來港欣賞賽事。港台亦會全力為十五運會和殘特奧會進行推廣、製作節目和直播工作。另外，在舉辦大型活動時，康樂及文化事務署（康文署）會因應活動性質邀請英語及其他外語媒體參與新聞發布會或進行廣告推廣，亦會與本地及國際媒體機構和活動夥伴（例如相關駐港總領事館、駐港文化機構、海外經濟貿易辦事處等）攜手合作推廣活動。康文署會充分利用其社交媒體平台進行宣傳，並且支援中英對照的內容，將具特色的活動推廣至本地及海外受眾。

除了上述宣傳措施外，新聞處現時已在多個社交媒體平台設立帳號，又撰寫更多英語帖文宣傳香港，並與中央媒體合作，利用他們境外的多語種新媒體平台，以多國語言向更多國家推廣香港。此外，新聞處持續與合適的海外媒體合作製作內容，介紹香港在重大領域的最新發展，例如創新及科技、體育、航運、文化藝術等，通過他們的讀者網絡和社交媒體平台，擴大海外宣傳的接觸面。新聞處會繼續留意市場最新發展和世界趨勢，善用合適平台提升香港的國際形象。"

問題：

政府在本年五月十四日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，水務署推行的「智管網」已於本年三月底完成設立全部2 400個監測區域，以協助加強管理供水管網滲漏。然而，據報地下水管爆裂事故依然頻繁發生，屯門區更於本年六月初在一周內發生多宗水管爆裂事故。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否檢視在「智管網」完成設立後仍接連發生地下水管爆裂事故的原因，以及有否研究改善方案；

（二）有否計劃在全港的食水分配管網設立更多獨立監測區域，並增加管網內的高科技監測和感應設備的數量，以及早發現地下水管異常情況，加強監察效果；及

（三）有何措施減低大型水管爆裂事故所造成的影響，包括有否考慮在水管老化的地區（例如屯門區）增設後備供水網絡，以減低事故發生時停水對當區居民及商戶的影響？

答覆：

主席︰

就周議員的提問，我現答覆如下：

（一）水務署自二○一六年起建立「智管網」，並已於二○二五年三月底完成設立2 400個監測區域，覆蓋約八成食水分配管網，加強管理供水管網滲漏。在二○二四年，水務署透過「智管網」偵測到政府食水水管的滲漏個案數目約為1 200多宗，讓署方及早進行維修，而食水水管滲漏比率已由二○○○年約25%下降至去年約13.4%。

但「智管網」的監測範圍目前尚未覆蓋主幹食水水管及餘下約兩成的食水分配管網，所以我們須擴闊其覆蓋範圍。此外，部分老舊水管，例如老舊鑄鐵及石棉水泥等物料所鑄造的水管因外部比較脆弱，即使水管在「智管網」的監測範圍內，如果受外力衝擊時有較大機會突然爆裂，所以我們亦需要按風險情況安排更換這些水管。

（二）考慮到上述情況，水務署已於去年年底開始擴大「智管網」監測範圍至食水主幹水管及餘下約兩成的食水分配管網。此外，水務署正陸續更新監測水管流量及水壓的傳感器，務求加快識別及處理潛在爆裂風險的水管。水務署計劃於二○二七年完成上述擴大及更新「智管網」的工作，我們已要求署方探討提早完成的可能性。

此外，水務署一直與本地及內地學術及科研機構合作，研究應用其他先進科技，例如聲納勘察、光纖技術等，協助及早發現水管滲漏情況。水務署將會與香港理工大學合作，在今年八月成立「管道機械人」聯合實驗室，為水管進行高精確度檢測。

要整個供水系統不同部分都能夠提供實時資訊，我們亦要在用戶端做工夫。在這方面，水務署已強制要求於二○一八年展開的新樓宇項目在用戶端安裝智能水錶。至於現有樓宇，水務署亦計劃陸續推動，目標是配合用戶日常的生活模式調節喉管內的水壓，做到整個供水管網系統可以「動態減壓」，以減低水管爆裂和滲漏風險。

（三）水務署在二○○○年至二○一五年進行了一項全港性更換及修復水管計劃，當時更換及修復了長約3 000公里的老化水管。

由二○一五年至二○二五年三月，再有約240公里長的水管已完成更換或修復。水務署去年獲立法會撥款，更換或修復約20公里長的大型鋼喉管，初步預計在二○二九年或之前陸續完成，當中約四公里的喉管位於屯門區。

水務署正檢視更換水管的考慮因素，包括滲漏或爆裂風險及其後果，以及更換水管的優先次序，稍後會提交短、中期計劃供發展局檢視。

現時水務署在一些重要設施（例如醫院）已提供雙重供水網絡，以加強供水的韌性。然而，倘若要在所有水管老化的地區增設後備供水網絡，需要考慮多方面的因素，例如市區地下設施密集、地下空間是否足夠；以及有關做法是否符合成本效益，因為建設和管理大部分時間只處於備用狀態的後備水管必定涉及相當的額外資源。

在發生水管爆裂事故時，水務署會採取適當措施，盡可能減少停水的影響範圍及時間，包括在可行的情況下在相連管網暫時調度食水以維持供應。

水務署亦會繼續加強供水事故應變管理，包括部署足夠水車以便短時間內應付突發需求，並且就緊急維修水管工作的消息發布機制更新內部指引，以及加強與各區民政事務處、區議員和關愛隊的溝通，建立即時通訊平台迅速互相通報。

水務署近年積極推動供水服務數字化，制定及加快推動「智慧水務」，相信透過分階段探索和實施一系列數碼化項目及利用科技、適時資源調配、有序工程部署和社區配合，水管管理和應變工作會日趨完善。

多謝主席。"
"LCQ3: Promoting development of ""home-stay lodgings""",2025-07-02 14:55,2025-07-02 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200536.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hok-fung and a reply by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

There are views that expensive accommodation costs, as well as lack of variety and limited choices are related to the fact that only about 66 per cent of Mainland tourists stayed overnight in Hong Kong during this year's Labour Day Golden Week, and that the Government should make good use of the natural resources in rural areas to develop home-stay lodgings, thereby extending tourists' length of stay. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it has been reported that Japan has relaxed its regulations on home-stay lodgings in recent years to focus more on management requirements than on strict hardware facility standards for hotels and guesthouses, whether the Government has studied regulating home-stay lodgings in this direction; if so, of the details;

(2) as there are views that Hong Kong has many rural locations with natural scenic beauty and potential for developing home-stay lodgings, such as Pui O and Mui Wo, whether the Government will study allowing village houses in such locations that have been issued with a Certificate of Compliance to automatically be eligible to operate as home-stay lodgings, in order to streamline the administrative procedures for applying to operate home-stay lodgings; if so, of the timetable; and

(3) as it has been reported that a private kitchen in rural areas has encountered considerable difficulties when applying for restaurant licences, whether the Government will relax requirements in the light of the unique circumstances of rural areas, and proactively assist rural home-stay lodgings that also operate restaurants by processing licences for both simultaneously, so as to accelerate the development of home-stay lodgings?

Reply:

President,

In response to the three parts of the question raised by the Hon Chan Hok-fung, having consulted the Development Bureau and the Environment and Ecology Bureau, my consolidated reply is as follows:

The Office of the Licensing Authority (OLA) under the Home Affairs Department is responsible for licensing and enforcement work under the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance (Cap. 349). The purpose of the Ordinance is to ensure that premises intended for use as hotels or guesthouses meet statutory building and fire safety standards to protect the safety of lodgers and the public. Moreover, as guests typically only stay in hotels or guesthouses during nighttime or for short periods and may not be familiar with escape routes, it is necessary to establish reasonable safety requirements to protect their safety. Under the current system, any premises providing paid short-term accommodation, including hotels, guesthouses or so-called ""home-stay lodgings"", must comply with the building and fire safety standards stipulated in the Ordinance before being licensed to operate. The Ordinance does not impose special restrictions on or exclude ""home-stay lodgings"". As long as the operation mode falls within the definition of hotel or guesthouse, an application for a licence to operate can be made, regardless of whether the premises is located in an urban or a rural area.

The OLA has long been adopting a flexible and pragmatic approach in processing all licence applications to facilitate the operation of licensed premises. When processing hotel and guesthouse licence applications, the OLA ensures that premises under the applications meet basic safety requirements such as building and fire safety standards, while taking into account the scale and operation mode of the premises. Additionally, premises must comply with relevant requirements of the Ordinance, in order to safeguard the safety of lodgers and the public while balancing the interests of other owners of premises in the same building. Most of these requirements were introduced by the Amendment Ordinance in 2020, including the no-use restriction requirement (i.e. there should be no restrictive clauses in the deed of mutual covenant or Government lease of the premises concerned) and the person responsible for operating, opening, or managing a hotel or guesthouse must meet the fit and proper requirement. The application process does not impose additional restrictions for ""home-stay lodgings"" type operations. Upon receiving a licence application, the OLA will conduct an on-site inspection and formulate applicable licensing requirements based on the specific circumstances of each premises. The Government has always prioritised public safety as its foremost consideration while striving to foster the healthy development of the industry. As long as the safety of guests, other persons in the same building and the general public is ensured, the OLA will proactively facilitate the application and approval processes for licences.

Currently, land leases for small houses in the New Territories generally permit non-industrial uses, including operation as guesthouses. Therefore, as long as the small house has obtained either a Certificate of Compliance or a ""No Objection to Occupy"" Letter from the Lands Department, no lease modification would be required. However, a guesthouse licence would still need to be applied for to operate a guesthouse so as to ensure the safety of lodgers and the general public.

However, we understand that village houses in rural areas have their own unique characteristics and constraints. The OLA has always adopted a flexible and pragmatic approach in processing such applications, allowing applicants to propose alternative solutions on a case-by-case basis to meet the requirements for licensing, provided that building and fire safety are ensured. As long as there is no compromise of public safety, relevant departments will consider local situations when processing applications for rural and old village houses, with a view to facilitating applicants to meet the licensing requirements.

As at May 31, 2025, 108 village houses in the New Territories or outlying islands in Hong Kong have been issued with guesthouse licences.

In fact, to promote eco-tourism, facilitate visitors, and help revitalise desolate villages, the Government's inter-departmental task force has formulated a series of streamlined measures to facilitate guesthouse and food business licence applications for some 90 countryside villages in the New Territories that have no vehicular access, taking into account the uniqueness of remote rural areas. These streamlined measures cover various aspects, including town planning, land, fire safety, building safety and sanitary requirements. Currently, relevant licences have been obtained for some guesthouses in Lai Chi Wo, a takeaway shop in Yim Tin Tsai, and a restaurant in Kuk Po under these streamlined measures. Based on these actual cases, the Government is sorting out the requirements, details, and implementation procedures of the streamlined measures and will compile a set of Guide to Application for reference by interested operators. The Government will continue to review room for enhancement in the licence application process for guesthouses and food businesses in countryside areas, with a view to creating a more business-friendly environment to support the work of countryside conservation and revitalisation.

âUnder the inter-departmental collaboration mechanism, the first batch of guesthouse licences was successfully issued for 11 village houses in Lai Chi Wo between December 2021 and September 2022.

Thank you, President."
​立法會五題：推動穩定幣的發展,2025-07-02 14:54,2025-07-02 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200431.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上吳傑莊議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的答覆：

問題：

本年五月通過的《穩定幣條例草案》旨在於香港設立法幣穩定幣發行人的發牌及監管制度。有意見認為這是全球Web3發展的里程碑，也是香港成為國際Web3中心的重要一步。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）如何推動穩定幣應用場景的拓展，包括推動穩定幣發行機構與內地應用場景連結，以促進穩定幣從監管合規到商業生態落地；

（二）政府如何藉着《穩定幣條例》的實施，在國際層面推介香港穩定幣法規的開放性和靈活性，並結合香港在「一國兩制」下的優勢，以及有利穩定幣發展的國際金融中心地位，吸引全球合規穩定幣發行機構及大型國際金融機構來港發行穩定幣並落戶香港；及

（三）會否為發展離岸人民幣穩定幣作出準備，包括爭取中央支持，以確立香港離岸人民幣穩定幣的信用？

答覆：

主席：

今年五月，立法會通過了《穩定幣條例草案》，為香港引入錨定法定貨幣的穩定幣發行人發牌制度。條例進一步完善香港數字資產活動的監管框架，以保障貨幣和金融穩定，並鞏固提升香港國際金融中心的地位。《穩定幣條例》將於今年八月一日生效，屆時香港金融管理局（金管局）將開始接受牌照申請。目前，金管局正就落實條例的具體指引進行市場諮詢，爭取盡快訂立指引。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢金管局，我現答覆如下：

（一）為了釋放穩定幣的潛力，政府及監管機構將提供有利的環境及必要的監管指引，促進香港持牌穩定幣發行人探索並實現不同的穩定幣應用場景，以解決經濟活動中的實際痛點，針對潛在風險提出監管重點，推動市場可持續發展。

其中，金管局在去年年初推出穩定幣發行人「沙盒」，旨在了解計劃在香港發行法幣穩定幣的機構的業務模式，並傳達監管預期及提供指引，同時促進穩定幣實際應用場景的發展。參與機構來自不同業界，包括跨境電商和物流、創新科技、銀行以及電訊服務行業，並具有本地和非本地背景。「沙盒」讓參與機構在有限範圍和風險可控的情況下，就其擬議的穩定幣應用場景和運作進行試驗。參與「沙盒」並非將來申請穩定幣發行人牌照的先決條件。

此外，政府最近發布了《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》（《政策宣言2.0》），涵蓋推進數字資產應用場景及跨界別合作的政策方向，並闡明探討以穩定幣作支付工具。為展現政府對穩定幣發展的支持及作領頭作用，政府在《政策宣言2.0》廣邀市場參與者就政府測試和利用獲發牌的穩定幣提出建議，例如如何用以提升政府支付的效率。

在發展市場和應用場景的同時，合規地經營業務同樣重要。穩定幣發行人在不同領域需具備充分的配套、關鍵的能力和經驗，例如儲備資產管理及資產的安全保障系統、有效的價格穩定機制和全面可行的贖回政策，還有科技安全、風險管控和反洗錢等方面的能力等。如穩定幣的應用場景牽涉其他地區，牌照申請人必須有整全的合規計劃及足夠資源，確保自身及商業夥伴持有所需牌照，以及在進行穩定幣相關活動時遵守香港及其他地區的相關法規。

（二）財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）和金管局一直就穩定幣的監管和發展與本地和其他地區的持份者，包括潛在穩定幣發行人、市場人士、專業服務提供者等，積極溝通。

隨着《穩定幣條例》即將實施，我們會加緊與世界各地不同持份者聯繫，闡述香港的穩定幣發行人監管框架，強調香港的框架平衡了風險管控和促進行業發展的特點，例如採取了較開放的模式，允許持牌發行人可選擇不同法幣幣種，作為發行穩定幣的錨定法幣。

我們也會繼續透過外訪和日常工作交流着力推廣香港作為國際金融中心的獨特優勢，包括與國際的緊密連結、成熟的金融市場和基礎設施、完善的法律體系，以及大量專業人才等。政府最近發布的《政策宣言2.0》，亦向世界各地的數字資產和相關業界，表明我們銳意將香港構建成全球數字資產中心的堅定決心和政策方向。

（三）香港的穩定幣發行人發牌制度具靈活性和開放性，允許持牌發行人可選擇不同法幣幣種，作為發行穩定幣的錨定法幣。我們歡迎全球不同地方的機構按實際業務需要申請牌照，並會以統一標準審批牌照申請，例如考慮發行人是否符合儲備資產管理、穩定機制、贖回安排和內部管控措施等監管要求。政府和金融監管機構會密切留意不同地區的監管發展，並與各地的監管機構保持溝通。

數字資產市場的發展瞬息萬變。政府會繼續秉持「相同業務、相同風險、相同規則」的原則，着重風險為本，持續優化和建立一套既切合本地情況，又依循國際標準和慣例的監管制度，促進香港數字資產市場健康、負責任和可持續發展，進一步鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位。

謝謝主席。"
LCQ5: Promoting development of stablecoins,2025-07-02 14:54,2025-07-02 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200429.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Johnny Ng and a reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 The Stablecoins Bill, passed in May this year, aims to establish a licensing and regulatory regime for fiat-referenced stablecoins issuers in Hong Kong. There are views that this marks a milestone in the global development of Web3 and represents an important step in Hong Kong's journey to becoming an international Web3 hub. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of ways to promote the expansion of stablecoin use cases, including fostering connections between stablecoin issuers and application scenarios on the Mainland, so as to facilitate the transition of stablecoins from regulatory compliance to establishment of business ecosystems;

(2) how the Government will leverage the implementation of the Stablecoins Ordinance to promote the openness and flexibility of Hong Kong's stablecoin laws and regulations internationally, while also synergising with Hong Kong's advantages under ""one country, two systems"" as well as its status as an international financial centre which is conducive to stablecoin development, to attract global compliant stablecoin issuers and large-scale international financial institutions to issue stablecoins and establish a presence in Hong Kong; and

(3) whether it will make preparations for the development of offshore Renminbi (RMB) stablecoins, including seeking support from the Central Authorities so as to establish the creditworthiness of Hong Kong's offshore RMB stablecoins?

Reply:

President,

 In May this year, the Legislative Council passed the Stablecoins Bill, establishing a licensing regime for issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins (FRS) in Hong Kong. The ordinance further strengthens the regulatory framework for digital asset activities in Hong Kong to safeguard monetary and financial stability, as well as consolidates and enhances Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre. The Stablecoins Ordinance will come into effect on August 1 this year, at which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will begin accepting licence applications. Currently, the HKMA is conducting a public consultation on the detailed guidelines for implementing the Ordinance with a view to finalising these guidelines as soon as practicable.

 Having consulted the HKMA, my reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) To harness the potential of stablecoins, the Government and regulators will provide a conducive environment and necessary regulatory guidance to enable licensed stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong to explore and implement different stablecoin use cases, with a view to addressing real-world pain points in economic activities, putting forward regulatory priorities for potential risks, and promoting the sustainable development of the market.

 To this end, the HKMA launched the stablecoin issuer sandbox early last year to allow the HKMA to understand the business models of institutions planning to issue FRS in Hong Kong, and to communicate regulatory expectations and provide guidance, while also fostering the development of practical use cases for stablecoins. With both local and global backgrounds, the participating institutions come from a wide spectrum of industries, including cross-border e-commerce and logistics, innovation and technology, banking and telecommunications services. The sandbox enables participants to conduct testing on their proposed use cases and operations within a limited scope and in a risk-controlled environment. Participation in the sandbox is not a prerequisite for licence application in the future.

 Furthermore, the Government recently issued the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong. It covers the policy direction for advancing digital asset use cases and cross-sectoral collaboration, and articulates the exploration of stablecoins as a payment tool. To demonstrate the Government's support and to take the lead, in the Policy Statement 2.0 the Government invites proposals from market participants on how the Government may test the usage of licensed stablecoins, for example in enhancing efficiency of Government payments.

 Alongside market and use case development, it is also important to ensure compliance in business operation. Stablecoin issuers must demonstrate adequate setup, capabilities and experience across a range of areas, including management and security of reserve assets, effective price stabilisation mechanisms, comprehensive and feasible redemption policies, as well as capabilities in technological security, risk management, and anti-money laundering. Where the use cases of stablecoins involve cross-border activities, applicants are also expected to develop a comprehensive compliance plan, demonstrate their financial strength, and ensure that they and their business partners have the necessary regulatory approvals and will comply with applicable regulations in Hong Kong and other jurisdictions, when they carry out activities related to their stablecoins.

(2) The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and the HKMA have been proactively communicating with stakeholders in Hong Kong and other jurisdictions on the regulation and development of stablecoins, including potential stablecoin issuers, market participants, and professional service providers.

 Along with the upcoming implementation of the Stablecoins Ordinance, we will further enhance our engagement with various stakeholders across the globe to elaborate on Hong Kong's regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, and highlight the balanced approach of our framework in managing risks while promoting industry development, such as adopting a more open model that allows licensed issuers to peg their stablecoins to different fiat currencies for the purpose of stablecoin issuance.

 We will also continue to promote Hong Kong's unique advantages as an international financial centre, including our close connection with the international markets, mature financial market and infrastructure, comprehensive legal system, and a wealth of professional talents, through overseas visits and on-going work exchanges. The Government's recent promulgation of the Policy Statement 2.0 also demonstrates to the digital asset and related sectors around the world our steadfast commitment and policy direction to establish Hong Kong as a global digital asset hub.

(3) The licensing regime for stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong is flexible and open, allowing licensed issuers to peg their stablecoins to different fiat currencies for the purpose of stablecoin issuance. We welcome institutions from around the world to apply for licence based on their actual business needs. We will review licence applications with a set of common standards, such as the issuer's compliance with regulatory requirements in the areas of reserve asset management, stabilisation mechanisms, redemption arrangements and internal control measures. The Government and financial regulators will closely monitor regulatory developments and maintain communications with regulatory authorities in different jurisdictions.

 The digital asset market is developing and evolving rapidly. Guided by the principle of ""same activity, same risks, same regulation"" and adopting a risk-based approach, the Government will continue to enhance and establish a regulatory regime that reflects local circumstances and aligns with international standards and practices, with a view to promoting the healthy, responsible and sustainable development of the digital asset market in Hong Kong, thereby further strengthening Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.

 Thank you, President."
立法會：民政及青年事務局局長就《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》動議二讀發言全文（只有中文）,2025-07-02 14:22,2025-07-02 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200489.htm,"以下是民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上就動議二讀《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》的發言全文：

主席：

我謹動議二讀《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）。

政府一貫的政策是不鼓勵賭博。針對賭博問題，政府採取多管齊下的策略，包括透過執法打擊非法賭博活動、透過公眾教育宣傳沉迷賭博的禍害、為有需要人士提供輔導和支援服務，以及透過法例規管賭博活動。

在透過法例規管賭博活動方面，政府提供合法賭博途徑的目的，只在於回應市民對某些賭博活動的需求，以免他們轉向非法的經營者下注。

近年有不少社會人士關注香港的非法籃球賭博問題。根據香港賽馬會（馬會）資料，在二○二四年，參與非法籃球博彩的人數約有43萬人，估計的非法籃球博彩收益介乎700億至900億港元，這兩個數字均較二○二三年的數字大幅上升。

為有效打擊非法賭博活動，財政司司長在《財政預算案》宣布，政府將積極探討規範籃球博彩活動。

我們已在今年四月就規範籃球博彩活動的建議方案進行了為期一個月的諮詢。超過九成的回應意見支持規範籃球博彩活動。因此，我們建議修訂《博彩稅條例》（第108章）及相關附屬法例，訂立籃球博彩活動的規管框架。

《條例草案》的主要修訂內容包括：

（一）賦權民政及青年事務局（民青局）局長發出籃球博彩牌照，並定立牌照規限，以減少賭博對市民，尤其是青少年的不良影響；

（二）沿用現行足球博彩稅的計算和徵收方法，即向舉辦商徵收淨投注金的50%作籃球博彩稅；

（三）修訂博彩及獎券事務委員會的職能，以涵蓋籃球博彩牌照的相關事宜。

若《條例草案》獲得通過，我們將會參考現時賽馬和足球博彩的模式，向馬會發出單一籃球博彩牌照，此舉可避免因經營者互相競爭而刺激對賭博的需求。

我們亦會透過一系列牌照條件和監管措施，嚴格監督馬會的籃球博彩業務，確保整個運作符合政府的政策和要求。

在牌照條件方面，我們會沿用現行足球博彩牌照的模式，制定相關條件，以進一步減少賭博對市民的不良影響。主要的牌照條件包括：

（一）民青局局長可為牌照制定有效期；

（二）政府將對投注種類和賽事的數量實施限制；

（三）馬會不得接受有香港球隊參與的賽事，以及在香港舉辦的籃球賽事的投注，以支持在香港推廣不涉賭博的健康籃球體育文化；

（四）馬會不得接受18歲以下人士的投注，亦不得接受信用卡投注。

主席，我明白不少議員和市民都關注規範籃球博彩是否會帶來鼓吹賭風或沉迷賭博的問題。我想在此強調，政府是非常重視預防與賭博相關的問題，尤其是涉及對青少年的影響。

在預防青年沉迷賭博問題方面，我們會進行兩方面的重點工作，包括施加嚴謹的法律與規管約束，以減少賭博對市民的不良影響；以及通過平和基金提供輔導、治療服務、教育和宣傳活動，以提升公眾對沉迷賭博禍害的認識。

其中，雖然青少年參與賭博的比例在過去多年一直維持在低水平，我們仍會增撥資源，在現時資助的四間輔導中心以外，設立專注於為青少年提供輔導及支援服務的新中心，向青少年樹立正確的法律觀和價值觀，特別是通過公眾教育提醒青少年，參與非法賭博，向非法收受賭注者投注已屬違法。

若《條例草案》獲得通過，政府將與馬會、警務處、平和基金諮詢委員會、博彩及獎券事務委員會及其他持份者繼續緊密合作，確保有效落實規管制度。我們已要求馬會增加對平和基金的捐款，以進一步加強平和基金的工作，並繼續完善輔導和支援服務，以積極有為的態度做好並優化預防及緩減與賭博有關問題的工作。我們亦會按需要要求馬會加強推行有節制博彩措施，以進一步減輕沉迷賭博可能造成的影響。

主席，我們已在六月九日的立法會民政及文化體育事務委員會上，就這項立法建議諮詢議員的意見。議員普遍支持建議，並支持政府向立法會提交《條例草案》。

我們會全力配合立法會的審議工作，並懇請各位議員支持《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》。

多謝主席。"

問題：

有意見認為香港擁有多個具本地特色的知識產權項目，當中電影《九龍城寨之圍城》在本地及海外均深受歡迎，於日本更有餐廳推出該電影的周邊產品食物並每天售罊，而不少影迷也因該電影而來港觀光，可見知識產權旅遊蘊含無限商機。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計過去三年受具有本地特色的知識產權項目、文化活動及盛事活動所吸引而訪港的旅客人數，以及其來源地、留港日數及消費金額和模式；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何，以及會否考慮作出統計；

（二）鑑於有業界人士和學者指出，以單一知識產權主導的旅遊項目難以持續，長遠策略應是串連多個同類型的知識產權，發揮協同效應（例如本港可研究結合《九龍城寨之圍城》及多個經典港產片的知識產權，建設「港版環球影城」，以最大發揮港產片的文化效益），政府有否考慮制訂策略，以促進不同知識產權持有人，以及與旅遊業界的合作；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）政府有否針對知識產權旅遊制訂專項策略，例如加強維護和推廣現有具特色的知識產權項目及相關景點，以及積極推出措施以鼓勵和支援知識產權創作和相關景點建設；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何，以及會否考慮制訂有關策略？

答覆：

主席：

本屆政府成立文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）推動文化、體育及旅遊融合發展，轄下文創產業發展處（文創處）積極加強對文創業界產業化發展的支援，提供平台促進跨界別、跨文化藝術領域的文化知識產權（IP）合作。我們十分鼓勵業界，例如餐飲、零售、旅遊等利用香港豐富的IP資源，發揮協同效應，吸引旅客和拓展商機。

就林健鋒議員的提問，經諮詢知識產權署，現綜合回覆如下：

香港擁有不少吸引旅客、具本地特色的景點，例如維多利亞港、香港迪士尼樂園、海洋公園、山頂纜車、香港摩天輪、昂坪360等，這些都是充滿香港文化特色的IP。文體旅局及香港旅遊發展局（旅發局）致力善用這些香港文化IP元素以及國際形象推廣旅遊。

二○二四年香港舉行超過240項盛事，共吸引約200萬名旅客參與，當中大部份旅客來自內地及東南亞地區，總共為香港帶來約75億元消費額，以及45億元經濟增加價值。這些盛事包括不少具本地特色，同時善用知名IP，例如「100%多啦A夢&FRIENDS」巡迴特展、Pokémon GO City Safari、PANDA GO！香港遊、ComplexCon 香港、Hypefest Hong Kong、香港動漫電玩節（動漫節），以及「俠之大者—金庸百年誕辰紀念．江湖盛滙」等。二○二五年，我們繼續迎來充滿IP元素的盛事，例如「CHIIKAWA DAYS」大型特展、CR7® LIFE 香港博物館開幕、2025年動漫節、展出眾多本地漫畫作品的「漫眾同樂—幽默港漫格格趣」展覽、香港時裝薈等。

我們透過具吸引力的IP主題活動，豐富旅客的旅遊和玩樂體驗，刺激消費。旅發局積極與盛事活動主辦單位合作，提供全方位支持，包括透過活動帶動本地旅遊。例如「100%多啦A夢&FRIENDS」巡迴特展期間，旅發局與展覽主辦單位合作在香港十個旅遊景點特設「隨意門」，吸引旅客和市民遊覽打卡。旅發局亦在其舉辦的旗艦活動聯乘主題IP，進一步透過結合特色IP推廣旅遊。例如二○二三年和二○二四年香港國際龍舟邀請賽與廣受全球歡迎的IP——LINE FRIENDS合作，沿星光大道特設LINE FRIENDS龍舟打卡點，吸引旅客和市民到訪打卡並投入龍舟盛事。旅客和市民更可在活動期間到限定店購買特別設計的香港限定紀念品。

在利用電影IP推廣旅遊方面，旅發局與電影出品方和有關單位聯手推出「走進香港走進香港電影」九龍城寨之圍城電影展覽，先後於香港國際機場及九龍城啟德AIRSIDE展出。展覽外設有電影周邊商品攤位售賣經典美食、懷舊玩具和電影精品，創造商機。文創處亦在九龍寨城公園舉辦為期三年的「九龍城寨光影之旅」，展示更多電影場景及本土傳統工藝陳設，重現城寨昔日面貌。展覽自今年五月開放以來，首月已吸引超過42000名市民及旅客參觀，帶動附近一帶餐飲和零售業的消費。

在主題公園方面，香港迪士尼樂園作為具豐富IP特色的地標旅遊景點，持續推出多項獨特的設施和活動，吸引旅客，包括已開幕的全球首個及最大型的《魔雪奇緣》主題園區及籌備中的「漫威」主題新園區、20週年慶祝活動、全新彼思主題娛樂體驗等。另外，海洋公園亦把握作為內地以外飼養最多大熊貓地方的優勢，根據六隻大熊貓的外型特徵打造大熊貓商標的設計，並推出具香港特色的相關的大熊貓宣傳活動、商品、文創精品、電子遊戲及旅遊產品等。除了廣泛應用大熊貓IP於公園的社交媒體內容及產品外，公園會繼續利用相關IP於園內推出以大熊貓主題節慶及沉浸式體驗活動、光影匯演、主題表演、遊樂設施等，亦會繼續與不同合作機構合作，推廣相關IP。

另外，文創處透過「創意智優計劃」（「計劃」）資助和推動多個融合本地動漫文化和旅遊的IP項目，包括資助業界為期兩年的「動漫體育大本營」，展示36個不同年代融入運動元素的本地原創動漫角色聯乘運動造型，例如老夫子配對桌球、石黑龍配對拳擊、契爺與牛仔配對乒乓球，呼應巴黎奧運會和全國運動會，推動香港文體旅融合的創新體驗。自二○二四年七月開幕至今，項目已吸引約46萬名市民及旅客到訪。以香港原創漫畫為主題的香港漫畫星光大道過去累計吸引超過300萬人次參觀。項目亦於二○二四年底加強和更新，展出100位漫畫家合共76個本地漫畫角色的彩繪塑像如王小虎、華英雄和麵包哥哥、50米長的大型漫畫牆及互動裝置，半年間超過85萬名參觀者，其中約四成為訪港旅客。年度盛事動漫節匯聚來自本地、內地和海外的動漫、手機／電腦遊戲和潮玩創作，每年吸引約25萬人次包括內地及海外旅客參觀。二○二五年的動漫節中有四個項目，包括「香港國際潮玩博覽」、「國際漫畫家大會及展覽」、「漫畫大師匯香港」及「港漫動力—香港漫畫支援計劃展館」，除了展出過百件香港、內地和海外潮玩和漫畫作品，還會舉辦多場漫畫大師分享會和工作坊。文創處會加強宣傳，吸引內地及海外旅客參觀。

在維護和強化IP保障層面，特區政府持續推動本地IP（包括文化IP）的發展，優化本地IP制度，確保制度與時並進、緊貼國際發展趨勢並切合香港經濟需要，包括實施加強數碼環境版權保護的《2022年版權（修訂）條例》，全面檢視本地註冊外觀設計制度並計劃於今年內展開公眾諮詢。完善的IP保護制度可激勵本地文創產業持續發展，更有助帶動包括旅遊業在內的相關產業鏈，促進經濟連鎖發展。文創處亦透過「計劃」積極支援文化IP項目，包括與旅遊有關項目，並推動申請機構為文創產品進行IP保護的申請、制定IP協議和管理IP組合等，以協助創作者開拓商機。

知識產權署透過製作和發布宣傳品及宣傳片，推廣尊重創意及保護IP的訊息，同時致力推行「正版正貨承諾」計劃及「我承諾」行動，向本地零售商、遊客及消費者宣揚售賣和購買正版貨的訊息。「正版正貨承諾」計劃多年來廣受本地商戶支持，每年平均有超過1500個零售商及7000個銷售點／網上商店參與。

特區政府會繼續以創新思維，結合科技、動漫、演藝和影視文化等優勢，支援IP創作、建設、聯乘，吸引更多旅客來港體驗本地獨特文化內涵，亦期望餐飲、零售、旅遊等業界好好利用IP項目發掘商機，共同落實「無處不旅遊」。"

In Japan, a restaurant has even launched peripheral food products inspired by the film, which sell out every day. Moreover, many film fans have visited Hong Kong for sightseeing due to the film, demonstrating the unlimited business opportunities of IP tourism. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the number of visitors attracted to Hong Kong by IP projects, cultural events and mega-events with local characteristics in the past three years, as well as their places of origin, length of stay in Hong Kong, and consumption amounts and patterns; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will consider compiling such statistics;

(2) as some members of the industry and academics have pointed out that tourism projects dominated by a single IP are difficult to sustain, and that the long-term strategy should be linking up multiple IPs of the same type to create synergy effects (e.g. Hong Kong can explore combining the IP of ""Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In"" and those of a number of classic Hong Kong films to build a ""Hong Kong version of Universal Studios"", with a view to maximising the cultural benefits of Hong Kong films), whether the Government has considered formulating a strategy to promote collaboration between different IP holders and the tourism industry; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether the Government has formulated a dedicated strategy for IP tourism, such as strengthening the protection and promotion of existing distinctive IP projects and related attractions, and actively introducing measures to encourage and support IP creation and the development of related attractions; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will consider formulating relevant strategies?

President,

The current Government has established the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) to promote the integrated development of culture, sports and tourism. The Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency (CCIDA) under the CSTB proactively strengthens its support towards the industrialisation development of the cultural and creative industries and provides a platform to foster cross-sectoral and cross-genre collaborations among cultural and creative sectors for cultural intellectual property (IP). We fully encourage industries such as catering, retailing and tourism to make use of the rich IP resources in Hong Kong to achieve synergy, attract tourists and explore business opportunities.

My reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Jeffrey Lam's question, in consultation with the Intellectual Property Department (IPD), is as follows:

There are a number of attractions in Hong Kong with local characteristics and tourism appeal, such as Victoria Harbour, the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort (HKDL), the Ocean Park (OP), the Peak Tram, the Hong Kong Ferris Wheel, Ngong Ping 360. They are also IPs with strong Hong Kong's cultural characteristics. The CSTB and the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) have been striving to promote tourism by making good use of these cultural IPs and the international image of Hong Kong.

In 2024, Hong Kong hosted over 240 mega events, attracting about two million visitors from mainly the Mainland and Southeast Asia region, and bringing a total spending of about HK$7.5 billion and added value of about HK$4.5 billion to the economy. Many of these mega events featured local characteristics and made good use of well-known IPs, such as the ""100% DORAEMON & FRIENDS"" Tour, Pokémon GO City Safari, PANDA GO! FEST HK, ComplexCon Hong Kong, Hypefest Hong Kong, Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong (ACGHK), and ""A Path to Glory - Jin Yong's Centennial Memorial • The World of Wuxia"", etc. In 2025, we continue to welcome events filled with IP elements, such as ""CHIIKAWA DAYS"" Exhibition, the opening of CR7® LIFE Museum Hong Kong, ACGHK 2025, ""Comic Fun for All: The Magic of Hong Kong Comedy Comics"" showcasing various local comics and Hong Kong Fashion Fest.

We have been making use of attractive IP-themed events to enrich visitors' travel and entertainment experience and stimulate spending. The HKTB proactively collaborates with event organisers to provide all round support, including driving local tourism through events. For example, during ""100% DORAEMON & FRIENDS"" Tour, the HKTB partnered with the exhibition organiser to present ""Anywhere Door"" at ten tourist spots in Hong Kong, attracting visitors and locals to explore the city and take photos. The HKTB also collaborates with IPs in flagship events and integrates with signature IPs to further promote tourism. For example, in organising the Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races in 2023 and 2024, the HKTB collaborated with the world's popular IP, LINE FRIENDS, to set up LINE FRIENDS dragon boat photo spots along the Avenue of Stars to attract visitors and locals to take photos and enjoy the races. Both visitors and locals could also purchase Hong Kong-exclusive merchandise designed for the races during the event period.

In terms of tourism promotion through leveraging movie IPs, the HKTB collaborated with the movie producer and relevant units to launch a movie exhibition titled ""Live out the Cinematic Charm of Hong Kong"" Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In. The exhibition was first staged at the Hong Kong International Airport and then AIRSIDE at Kai Tak, Kowloon City. In parallel, merchandise vendors on site offered classic dishes, nostalgic toys and movie merchandise to create business opportunities. The CCIDA also organises the three-year ""Kowloon Walled City: A Cinematic Journey"" Movie Set Exhibition at the Kowloon Walled City Park, showcasing more movie sets and local traditional craftsmanship displays, recreating scenes of the Walled City. Over 42000 locals and tourists were attracted in the first month since its opening in May this year, driving catering and retailing spending in the vicinity.

In terms of theme parks, the HKDL, a landmark attraction with rich IP features, has been introducing various unique facilities and events to attract visitors, including the opening of the world's first ever and largest Frozen-themed land, the new Marvel-themed area under planning, the 20th anniversary celebration and an all-new Pixar entertainment experience. On the other hand, the OP, capitalising on its advantage of being home to the largest number of giant pandas outside the Mainland, has created the giant pandas' IPs according to the physical traits of the six giant pandas and launched giant panda-related promotional activities, merchandise, cultural and creative products, video games, tourism products, etc, with Hong Kong's characteristics. In addition to the extensive use of the giant pandas' IPs in OP's social media content and merchandise, the OP will continue to make use of the relevant IP to launch giant panda-themed festive events, immersive experience activities, light shows, thematic performances, amusement facilities, etc, and partner with different organisations to promote the IPs.

Separately, the CCIDA, through the CreateSmart Initiative (CSI), has funded and promoted various IP projects that integrate local animation and comic culture with tourism. These include the two-year AniCom Sports Park which showcases 36 locally created AniCom characters from different eras, each paired with a sports-themed design, such as ""Old Master Q"" with snooker, ""Dragon Shik"" with boxing and ""My Boy"" with table tennis, echoing the Olympic Games Paris and the National Games to promote the innovative experience of integrating culture, sports and tourism in Hong Kong. Since its launch in July 2024, the project has attracted about 460000 locals tourists. The Hong Kong Avenue of Comic Stars, with the theme of local original comics, has drawn over three million visitors to date. The project was enhanced and updated in late 2024, now featuring 76 coloured figurines of local comic characters created by 100 artists, such as ""Wang Xiao Hu"", ""Hero Wah"" and ""MinBao Gor"", along with a 50-meter-long large-scale comic wall and interactive installations. In half a year, it attracted over 850000 visitors with approximately 40 per cent of them being tourists. The annual mega event, the ACGHK, brings together comics and animation, mobile/computer games and art toy creations from Hong Kong, the Mainland and overseas, attracting about 250000 tourists from the Mainland and overseas annually. The ACGHK 2025 will feature four projects, namely the Hong Kong International Art Toys Expo, the International Comic Artist Conference and Exhibition, the Comics Masters Gathering Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong Comics Support Programme Pavilion. Apart from showcasing over 100 art toys and comic works from Hong Kong, the Mainland and overseas, there will also be sharing sessions and workshops led by comic masters. The CCIDA will strengthen publicity in order to attract visitors from the Mainland and overseas.

On upholding and strengthening IP protection, the Government continues to drive the development of local IP (including cultural IP), enhance the local IP regime, ensuring that it keeps abreast of the times, aligns with international trends, and meets Hong Kong's economic needs, including the implementation of the Copyright (Amendment) Ordinance 2022 to strengthen copyright protection in the digital environment, and a comprehensive review of the local registered designs regime and plans to launch a public consultation within this year. A robust IP protection regime can foster the sustainable development of local cultural and creative industries, as well as help drive the growth of related industry chains, including tourism, thereby spurring the development of the economy. The CCIDA is also actively supporting cultural IP projects, including those related to tourism, through CSI, and driving applicants to make applications for IP protection for their cultural and creative products, formulate IP agreements and manage IP portfolios, etc, so as to assist creators in exploring business opportunities.

The IPD advocates for the messages of respecting creativity and IP protection through producing and disseminating promotional materials and videos. At the same time, it is committed to implementing the ""No Fakes Pledge"" Scheme and the ""I Pledge"" Campaign to encourage the selling and buying of genuine goods among local retailers, tourists and consumers. The ""No Fakes Pledge"" Scheme has garnered widespread support from local businesses over the years, with an average annual participation of over 1500 retail merchants and 7000 outlets/online shops.

The Government will continue to support IP creation, construction and cross-over through innovative thinking, combining with our edges in technology, animation and comics, the performing arts, film and television culture to attract more tourists to come to Hong Kong to experience the unique local cultural connotation. We also hope that the catering, retailing and tourism industries can make good use of IP projects to explore business opportunities and implement the concept of ""tourism is everywhere in Hong Kong"" together."

（一）據報日本近年放寬民宿規管，側重管理要求，而非如酒店及賓館般對其硬件設施實施嚴格規範，政府有否研究循此方向規管民宿；若有，詳情為何；

（二）鑑於有意見認為，香港有很多兼具天然美景及民宿發展潛力的鄉郊地點（例如貝澳及梅窩），政府會否研究讓位於該等地點並已獲發合約完成證明書（俗稱「滿意紙」）的村屋自動獲得民宿經營資格，以減省申辦民宿的行政程序；若會，時間表為何；及

（三）據報有位於鄉郊的私房菜館申請食肆牌照時遇到頗大困難，政府會否因應鄉郊特殊情況而放寬規定，並主動協助兼營食肆的鄉郊民宿統一辦理牌照，以加快民宿發展步伐？

答覆：

主席：

就陳學鋒議員三個部分的提問，經諮詢發展局和環境及生態局後，現綜合回覆如下：

民政事務總署轄下牌照事務處（牌照處）負責《旅館業條例》（第349章）（《條例》）的發牌及執法工作。《條例》的目的是確保擬用作酒店或賓館的處所，在樓宇及消防安全方面達到法定標準，以保障入住者及公眾的安全。此外，由於旅客通常都只在晚間或較少時間逗留在酒店或賓館，未必清楚有關處所的逃生路徑，因此有必要制訂合理程度的安全要求，以保障旅客的安全。現行制度下，任何提供短期收費住宿的處所，包括酒店、賓館或所謂「民宿」，都必須符合《條例》訂明的樓宇和消防安全標準，方能獲發牌照營業。《條例》並無針對「民宿」作出特別規限或排除，只要經營模式符合酒店或賓館的定義，無論是位於市區還是鄉郊，均可申領牌照經營。

牌照處一貫以靈活務實的態度，處理所有牌照申請，促進持牌處所的營運。在審批酒店及賓館牌照申請時，牌照處會確保申請處所達到基本安全要求，例如樓宇和消防安全，同時考慮該處所的規模和運作模式。此外，處所還需符合《條例》的相關規定，以保障入住者及公眾的安全，並兼顧處所所在大廈其他業主的權益。這些規定大部分是二○二○年修訂條例引入的規定，包括無使用限制規定，即申請牌照的處所所在大廈的公契中或地契中不可包含任何相關限制性條文；以及經營、開設或管理酒店或賓館的人士須為適當人選等，申請過程不會因屬「民宿」形式而加設額外限制。牌照處在收到牌照申請後，會派員到有關處所進行實地視察，根據個別處所的情況制訂適用的發牌要求。政府一直以保障公眾安全視為首要考慮，同時致力於促進業界的健康發展。在確保旅客、處於同一幢大廈內其他人士及公眾安全的前提下，牌照處會積極便利牌照申請和審批。

目前新界小型屋宇的土地契約一般容許非工業用途，即包括用作旅館用途，因此只要小型屋宇獲地政總署發出合約完成證明書（俗稱完工證）或不反對佔用書，不用再走程序去改契，但仍須申請旅館牌照方可營辦旅館，以保障入住者及公眾的安全。

然而，我們明白鄉郊地區的村屋有其獨特情況和限制。牌照處一向以靈活和務實的方式處理相關申請，並因應個別情況讓申請人提出替代方案，只要能確保樓宇及消防安全，便可獲批牌照。在不影響公眾安全的前提下，對於鄉郊和古舊村屋的申請，相關部門會因地制宜，協助申請人配合牌照要求。

截至二○二五年五月三十一日，本港已有108間位於新界或離島的鄉郊村屋獲牌照處發出賓館牌照。

事實上，為促進生態旅遊、利便訪客和協助活化荒僻村落，政府跨部門工作小組因應偏遠鄉郊地區的獨特性，為現時位於新界偏遠鄉郊、沒有車路連接的90多條鄉郊村落制訂一系列便利賓館及食物業牌照申領過程的優化措施，涵蓋城市規劃、土地、消防安全、樓宇安全及衞生方面等不同範疇。現時，已有位於荔枝窩的賓館、鹽田梓的外賣店和谷埔的餐廳，根據相關優化措施取得有關的牌照。政府正根據這些真實案例，梳理優化措施的要求、細節和執行步驟，並將匯編成一套《申請指引》，以供有意營運者參考。政府會持續檢視鄉郊地區賓館及食物業牌照申領過程的優化空間，為鄉郊地區締造更友善的營商環境，支持鄉郊保育和活化的工作。

在跨部門協作機制下，荔枝窩11間村屋已於二○二一年十二月至二○二二年九月期間成功獲發首批賓館牌照。

多謝主席。"
立法會二十二題：建設「無廢灣區」,2025-07-02 12:25,2025-07-02 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200374.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上陳月明議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

據悉政府正與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）其他內地城市探討推進「無廢灣區」建設，而粵港兩地會以區域性策略處理廢物管理問題，透過優勢互補，加強推動大灣區可回收物料的區域性循環利用。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）粵港政府於本年一月成立的「無廢灣區」建設專題小組的具體工作方向和策略，以及最新的工作進度為何；

（二）在「無廢灣區」的機遇下，政府將如何發揮香港內聯外通的優勢，促進發展大灣區綠色產業和循環經濟，以及有否評估當中可能出現的困難和挑戰；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）特區政府是否已開始探討跨境運送廢物往大灣區其他內地城市的安排，例如運輸方式（即海路或陸路）和每日處理量；如是，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆︰

主席︰

（一）根據國家生態環境部印發的《粵港澳大灣區生態環境保護規劃》，香港特別行政區政府與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）內地城市持續建設「無廢灣區」，探索「無廢城市」區域共建模式。粵港雙方已於今年一月舉行的粵港環保及應對氣候變化合作小組會議，成立「無廢灣區」建設專題小組（專題小組），作為兩地推進固體廢物管理與資源循環合作的固定機制，以加強政策對接、技術交流與專案協作，提升固體廢物協同處置能力。

專題小組已在今年三月二十七日召開首次會議，由香港特別行政區政府環境保護署與廣東省生態環境廳聯合主持，重點探討以區域優勢互補策略，推動大灣區可回收物料的資源化利用，並通過「項目化推進落實」模式深化合作，共同發展綠色產業和相關設施。目前，專題小組已就區域性資源循環合作、廢物管理政策等議題展開初步討論，並正積極商討推動兩地法規協調和市場對接。

（二）及（三）我們與大灣區內地城市的合作方向，是透過共同建設「無廢城市」推動將廢物轉為資源循環利用，而不是轉移都市固體廢物送往大灣區內地城市處理。

在專題小組的合作框架下，香港將充分發揮背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，進一步深化與其他大灣區內地城市在共同建設「無廢城市」和資源循環利用等領域的合作。一方面引入內地先進的回收處理技術與規模化產業經驗，另一方面結合香港國際化市場環境與成熟的環保管理體系，共同探索區域性循環經濟的發展路徑。例如，正在屯門環保園興建的紙漿生產設施和退役電動車電池回收設施，皆引進內地成熟技術處理本地廢紙和退役電動車電池，既提升香港在區域綠色產業鏈的角色，也促進大灣區綠色科技的協同發展和環保產業互利合作。

至於香港本地的都市固體廢物處理，特區政府正全力發展先進高效的現代轉廢為能設施網絡。第一座在石鼓洲旁建設中的現代垃圾焚化設施I∙PARK1將於今年內開始運作。此外，特區政府正全力推進發展I∙PARK2，工程項目已於去年十二月開展公開招標，並將於今年七月十八日截標，我們會適時就工程向立法會申請撥款。"

非物質文化遺產（非遺）是中華優秀傳統文化的重要組成部分，是中華文明綿延傳承的生動見證。文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）及康樂及文化事務署（康文署）一直致力保護、傳承和推廣香港非遺，積極配合國家推進非遺保護的工作方針，推行加強保護非遺的措施，因應不同範疇的非遺項目深化在確認、立檔、研究、保存、推廣和傳承等多方面的工作，以提高公眾對非遺的認識，鼓勵社會共同參與保護非遺。有關工作包括康文署的非遺資助計劃，支持合資格的本地團體和個人推行具意義的本地非遺計劃。此外，康文署於二○二四年十二月公布更新的香港非遺代表作名錄及香港非遺清單，非遺代表作名錄項目由20個增至24個，非遺清單項目則由480個增至507個。

按二○二四年《施政報告》中提出的兩項推動非遺保護和傳承的措施，康文署轄下的非遺辦事處於二○二五年制定香港非遺代表作名錄項目傳承人的認定機制和準則，並於每年六月舉辦「香港非遺月」。

就吳議員問題的三個部分，我分別回覆如下：

（一）首屆「香港非遺月」於二○二五年五月三十一日至七月一日圓滿舉行，活動包括超過80場非遺表演、60個非遺互動體驗攤位和24個「非遺精華遊蹤」活動，涵蓋超過100項非遺項目。應康文署的邀請，超過20個社區團體參與籌辦當中的活動，增加「香港非遺月」在社會的覆蓋力和滲透力。

截至二○二五年六月二十一日，首屆「香港非遺月」的參與人次已超過八萬五千，預計總參與人次超過10萬。雖然沒有具體的旅客比例數字，但首屆「香港非遺月」的開幕禮及非遺嘉年華選擇在旅客眾多的尖沙咀香港文化中心露天廣場舉行，適逢內地端午節的長周末假期，吸引了不少旅客參與這場非遺嘉年華。其中「非遺精華遊蹤」約有三分一的名額給予境外旅客，旅客的反應非常正面，康文署日後會繼續在這方面作嘗試，加強文旅融合。各項活動的參與人次詳見我們提供的附件。

首屆「香港非遺月」成功凝聚社會對香港和內地非遺的認識，透過政府與民間組織的協作，以及本地和內地非遺團體及工作者的積極參與，讓市民及旅客感受到「香港處處有非遺」。

（二）康文署已研究了國家關於非遺代表性傳承人的認定與管理辦法，並完成蒐集和了解廣東省、澳門等鄰近地區在規劃、制定和執行認定傳承人或團體的相關資料，涵蓋當地的認定機制、管理制度及傳承人取消機制等。目前，國家的管理辦法有涵蓋取消機制，而廣東和澳門也有各自適用的取消機制。康文署會參考上述資料，並因應香港非遺傳承的實際狀況，擬備符合香港情況的方案，包括申請傳承人或團體要遵守的要求、認定機制和準則，以及適用的取消機制。康文署會就所草擬的方案諮詢非遺諮詢委員會的意見，確保訂定一套嚴謹和適用於香港情況的認定機制和準則，以有效認定高質素及致力傳承非遺的傳承人或團體，增強保護和傳承香港非遺。我們預期於今年內公布有關香港非遺傳承人的認定機制和準則。

（三）至於非遺文化IP（知識產權）方面，非遺辦事處近年積極協助本港文化及創意產業品牌，推出文藝創意商品。例如自二○二四年起與本地時裝品牌合作，讓香港非遺元素以嶄新的方式呈現，為時尚愛好者帶來一系列活化傳統的新派長衫，以及以非遺元素創作的服飾。除了在香港開展宣傳推廣，亦會透過在香港以外的地方，例如倫敦、上海及深圳，舉行時裝表演展示香港非遺。非遺辦事處會繼續為合適的文化及創意產業品牌，提供非遺資訊，協助他們將非遺活化為可增值的文創產品。

此外，文體旅局轄下文創產業發展處透過「創意智優計劃」資助及推動本地文創業界與非遺傳承人聯乘合作，在本地、內地及海外文創展覽或活動中推廣香港非遺，以及支援香港設計師以非遺為題材創作文創產品，宣傳香港非遺同時促進文創業界產業化發展。這些項目包括二○二四年十一月深圳讀書月及二○二五年四月香港悅讀周期間舉行「故宮館藏x香港非遺」展覽；二○二五年六月在北京國際圖書博覽會設立以「漫步香港：非遺與城市記憶」為主題的香港館；以及將於二○二五年十一月舉行的「香港原創潮玩展2025@吉隆坡」展出香港原創潮玩設計師，以香港非遺為題材創作的全新潮玩等。"
"LCQ22: Development of ""Zero Waste Bay Area""",2025-07-02 12:25,2025-07-02 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200375.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Chan Yuet-ming and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 It is learnt that the Government is exploring with other Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to take forward the development of ""Zero Waste Bay Area"", and that Guangdongand Hong Kong will tackle waste management issues through regional strategies and enhance regional recycling of recyclable materials in the GBA by leveraging each other's competitive advantages and complementing strengths. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the specific work directions and strategies of the Special Panel for Building ""Zero Waste Bay Area"" established by the governments of Guangdongand Hong Kong in January this year, and the latest progress of its work;

(2) given the opportunities arising from the ""Zero Waste Bay Area"", how will the Government capitalise on Hong Kong's advantage of connecting the country with the world to facilitate the development of green industries and a circular economy in the GBA, and whether it has assessed the difficulties and challenges that may arise in the process; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether the HKSAR Government has started to explore the arrangements for the cross-boundary transportation of waste to other Mainland cities in the GBA, such as the mode of transport (i.e. sea or land) and daily handling capacity; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

(1) According to the ""Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Ecological Environmental Protection Plan"" promulgated by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government continuously works with the Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to develop a ""Zero Waste Bay Area"" and explore regional co-operation models for achieving ""Zero Waste City"". The Special Panel for Building ""Zero Waste Bay Area"" (the Special Panel) was established by Guangdong and Hong Kong at the Hong Kong-Guangdong Joint Working Group on Environmental Protection and Combating Climate Change meeting held in January this year, serving as a standing mechanism for advancing solid waste management and resources circulation co-operation between the two places, thereby strengthening policy co-ordination, technical exchanges and project collaboration, as well as elevating the capability in jointly handling solid waste.

 The first meeting of the Special Panel, held on March 27 this year, was co-chaired by the Environmental Protection Department of the HKSAR Government and the Department of Ecology and Environment of Guangdong Province. It mainly focused on exploring strategies leveraging on the complementary advantages of the region, to promote resources circulation of recyclable materials in the GBA and foster collaborative development of green industries and related facilities through deepening the collaboration by a joint ""project-based"" model. At present, the Special Panel has commenced initial discussions on topics such as regional co-operation in resources circulation and waste management policy, and is actively discussing how to promote the co-ordination of regulations and market integration between the two places.

(2) and (3) The co-operation direction with the Mainland cities of the GBA is to promote resources circulation through the joint development of ""Zero Waste City"", instead of transferring the municipal solid waste (MSW) to the Mainland cities of the GBA for treatment.

 Under the co-operation framework of the Special Panel, Hong Kong will fully capitalise on our distinctive advantage of having strong support of the Motherland and being closely connected to the world to further deepen the co-operation with other Mainland cities of the GBA in areas such as developing a ""Zero Waste City"" and promoting resources circulation. Hong Kong will introduce advanced recycling technologies and large-scale industrial expertise from the Mainland on one hand; and integrate its international market environment with its mature environmental management system to jointly explore the development pathway of a regional circular economy on the other. For example, the paper pulping facility and the retired electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling facility currently under construction in EcoPark, Tuen Mun, both incorporate mature Mainland technologies to process local waste paper and retired EV batteries. This not only strengthens Hong Kong's role in the regional green industry chain, but also fosters collaborative development of green technologies and mutually beneficial co-operation in the environmental industry of the GBA.

 As for the local treatment of MSW in Hong Kong, the HKSAR Government is pressing ahead with the development of a network of advanced and highly efficient modern waste-to-energy facilities. The first modern incineration facility for treating MSW currently under construction near Shek Kwu Chau, IâPARK1, will commence operation within this year. In addition, the HKSAR Government is pushing forward the development of IâPARK2 at full steam. The open tender for the project was invited in last December and will close on July 18 this year. We will seek funding from the Legislative Council for the project in a timely manner."
LCQ1: Sustainable development of intangible cultural heritage,2025-07-02 12:25,2025-07-02 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200331.htm,"  âFollowing is a question by the Hon Stanley Ng and a reply by the Under Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Mr Raistlin Lau, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

  There are views that the first Hong Kong Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) Month held last month enabled members of the public and tourists to experience the vitality and charm of Hong Kong's ICH, and that transmitting ICH skills and the economic benefits brought about by the related cultural and creative intellectual property rights (IP) are conducive to the sustainable development of Hong Kong's ICH. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of participants or visitors to the various activities of the first Hong Kong ICH Month, and the proportion of travellers among them; whether an assessment has been conducted on the effectiveness of Hong Kong ICH Month;

(2) as it has been reported that the Government will announce a system for designating Hong Kong ICH bearers this year, whether the system will cover designation for both categories of bearer and bearer organisation; whether a mechanism will be established to revoke the status of bearers, ensuring that ICH remains vibrant and relevant over time, as well as maintaining the vitality of the transmission system and the enthusiasm of bearers; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as it is learnt that the rapid development of IP of ICH in the Mainland has generated considerable economic benefits, of the mechanism put in place by the Government to regularly follow up on, incubate, support, protect and compile statistics on cultural and creative IP projects derived from Hong Kong's ICH, so that they can sustainably create cultural value and economic benefits?

Reply:

President,

  Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) is an essential part of the fine traditional Chinese culture, and a lively witness to the continuous transmission of Chinese culture. The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) are committed to safeguarding, transmitting and promoting the ICH of Hong Kong, while actively supporting the national policies on furthering the safeguarding of ICH and implementing enhanced measures. Targeting ICH items across various domains, different aspects of work such as identification, documentation, research, preservation, promotion and transmission of ICH are strengthened to enhance the public's understanding of ICH and engage the community in safeguarding ICH. The above work includes the ICH Funding Scheme of the LCSD, which supports eligible local organisations and individuals in implementing meaningful local ICH projects. In addition, the LCSD released in December 2024 the updated Representative List of the ICH of Hong Kong (Representative List), with an increase in its number of items from 20 to 24, and the updated ICH Inventory of Hong Kong, with an increase in its number of items from 480 to 507.
  
  The 2024 Policy Address proposed two measures to promote the safeguarding and transmission of ICH, whereby the LCSD will develop a mechanism and criteria in 2025 for recognising the bearers of the items on the Representative List, as well as organise the Hong Kong ICH Month in June every year.
  
  In response to the Hon Stanley Ng's three-part question, my replies are as follows:

(1) The inaugural Hong Kong ICH Month was successfully held from May 31 to July 1, 2025. Activities include over 80 ICH performances, 60 interactive experiential booths on ICH and 24 field trips under ""ICH Highlight Tours"", covering more than 100 ICH items. By invitation of the LCSD, over 20 community organisations participated in organising activities during the Hong Kong ICH Month so as to expand the coverage of the event and extend its reach in the community.

  With the attendance of the activities of the inaugural Hong Kong ICH Month already surpassing 85 000 as at June 21, 2025, the final total attendance of the event is estimated to be more than 100 000. Despite the unavailability of figures on the percentage of visitors, since the tourist-filled Piazza of the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui was chosen as the venue of the opening ceremony and the ensuing ICH carnival of the inaugural Hong Kong ICH Month, and both activities fell on the Mainland's long weekend holiday in celebration of the Tuen Ng Festival, many visitors were attracted to the ICH carnival. Among others, around one-third of the ""ICH Highlight Tours"" quotas were given to visitors, and their feedback was very positive. The LCSD will continue to make efforts in this area in the future to enhance the integration of culture and tourism. A breakdown of the attendance of the Hong Kong ICH Month 2025 by activity is set out at Annex.
  
  The inaugural Hong Kong ICH Month successfully enriched the public's understanding of the ICH items of both Hong Kong and the Mainland. Through the collaboration between the Government and community organisations, as well as the active participation of local and Mainland ICH organisations and practitioners, the public and visitors were provided with an experience of ""ICH Around Town"".

(2) The LCSD has studied the national guidelines for the recognition and management of ICH bearers. It has also completed its collection of and gained insight into relevant information on the planning, formulation and implementation of the mechanism for recognising ICH bearers or bearer organisations, the management system and the cancellation mechanism for the recognised ICH bearers or bearer organisations, etc in Guangdong Province, Macao and other neighbouring regions. Currently, the national guidelines include a cancellation mechanism, while Guangdong and Macao also have their own relevant cancellation mechanisms. The LCSD will take into account the aforementioned information and consider the current transmission of Hong Kong's ICH to prepare a proposal that is in accord with the actual situation of Hong Kong. The proposal will cover the requirements for applicants for the status of ICH bearer or bearer organisation to follow, the mechanism and criteria for recognition, as well as a cancellation mechanism where applicable. The LCSD will consult the ICH Advisory Committee on the draft proposal to ensure that a set of stringent recognition mechanism and criteria suitable for Hong Kong is formulated to effectively recognise high-quality bearers or bearer organisations that are committed to transmitting ICH, thereby enhancing the protection and transmission of Hong Kong's ICH. The mechanism and criteria are expected to be promulgated within this year.

(3) As regards intellectual property based on ICH, the ICH Office has actively assisted cultural and creative industry brands in Hong Kong in launching creative cultural merchandise in recent years. For example, it has co-operated with a local fashion brand since 2024 to present Hong Kong's ICH elements in a novel way to bring fashion lovers a series of new-style cheongsams that revitalise traditions, and clothing created with ICH elements. In addition to a publicity and promotional campaign launched in Hong Kong, fashion shows were organised in places outside of Hong Kong, such as London, Shanghai and Shenzhen, to showcase Hong Kong's ICH. The ICH Office will continue to provide information on ICH for suitable cultural and creative industry brands to assist them in transforming ICH into value-‍added cultural and creative products through revitalisation.

  Furthermore, the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency under the CSTB, through the CreateSmart Initiative, provides funding support and drives to foster cross-sectoral collaboration between local cultural and creative industries and ICH bearers, promote Hong Kong's ICH at cultural and creative exhibitions and events staged in Hong Kong, the Mainland and overseas, and support Hong Kong designers to create cultural and creative products themed on ICH. These collaborations promote the ICH of Hong Kong, as well as facilitate the development of cultural and creative sectors as industries. Examples include the ""Palace Museum Collections x Hong Kong Intangible Cultural Heritage"" Exhibition held during the Shenzhen Reading Month in November 2024 and the Hong Kong Reading Week in April 2025, the Hong Kong Pavilion themed ""Strolling through Hong Kong: Intangible Cultural Heritage and Urban Memories"" set up at Beijing International Book Fair in June 2025, and the Hong Kong's ICH-themed new art toys created by Hong Kong original art toy designers to be showcased in the ""Hong Kong Art Toy Story 2025@Kuala Lumpur"" in November 2025."

胡文新主席（香港冰球訓練學校兼香港業餘冰球會主席）、朱劍平處長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室宣傳文體部體育處處長）、各位嘉賓、各位教練、各位冰球員、各位朋友：

大家早上好。很高興今日來到將軍澳這個冰場為全港十八區青少年冰球錦標賽主持開幕禮。

剛才看了一會比賽，我已經看見大家充滿朝氣與活力的年輕臉孔。冰球是一項講求節奏、速度和控球技巧的高強度運動。在冰面上高速滑行、傳球和射門，不但考驗球員的體能，還需要機智與判斷，電光火石之間就決定了勝負。

體育活動在社區的普及，實有賴各界鼎力支持和參與。全港青少年地區冰球發展計劃已推行接近二十年，與超過300多間學校合作，為約44 000多名青少年提供培訓。我衷心感謝香港冰球訓練學校與香港業餘冰球會的教練和團隊，本着他們自己對冰球運動的熱誠，不遺餘力推動這項運動，並成功培育了不少有潛質的青少年球員。

值得一提的是，過去一年，在Thomas（胡文新）的帶領下，香港冰球訓練學校與香港業餘冰球會為全港14個地區的學校籌組了17支青少年冰球隊，進行常規訓練，並協助當中五間學校在校內設立仿真溜冰場，其中一間學校更把冰球運動納入其校本體育本科。香港冰球訓練學校與香港業餘冰球會在推廣冰球運動方面的努力與建樹，大家有目共睹。

今日，來自不同地區的球員齊集在真雪溜冰場，互相較量，是展現辛苦訓練成果的好機會。我鼓勵大家全力以赴，盡情發揮，好好享受比賽的過程，並從中汲取經驗，不斷精益求精。

最後，我謹祝全港十八區青少年冰球錦標賽圓滿成功，各位球員有出色的發揮。多謝大家。"

答覆：

主席：

就周小松議員的提問，經諮詢渠務署後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（六）勞工處不時巡查全港工作場所，以保障工人工作時的安全及健康。由於巡查密閉空間工作是勞工處日常進行職安健巡查的一部分，因此勞工處沒有專就這類工作場所分項備存巡查地點和相關執法數字。然而，自二‍○二二年起，勞工處與主要負責渠務工程的政府部門和法定機構（包括渠務署、房屋署、路政署和香港機場管理局）建立通報機制，這些部門／機構會定期向勞工處通報需要工人進入密閉空間進行渠務或地底喉管工作的日期和時間，以便勞工處按風險為本策略，選擇有較高風險的密閉空間工作進行突擊巡查和加強執法。自通報機制建立至今年五月，勞工處共收到8 608次通報，並進行780次巡查。相關的通報和巡查數字載於附件一。

在突擊巡查密閉空間工作時，勞工處人員會檢視相關工序及設備，例如有否進行風險評估及有否執行相應的風險控制措施、工人是否符合培訓及相關工作經驗的要求、進行地底喉管工作的工人有否配戴認可的呼吸器具及適當的安全吊帶等。此外，自二○二四年十一月三十日修訂版《密閉空間工作的安全與健康工作守則》生效後，勞工處人員會特別留意東主或承建商有否按照守則採取相關措施，包括在工作期間於密閉空間的出入口拍攝視頻，加強保障工人的職安健。過去三年，勞工處就通報系統而進行的突擊巡查共向相關東主或承建商發出13份敦促改善通知書及136封警告信。這些違規事項主要涉及未有進行全面的風險評估、發出不完整的許可工作證明書及未有正確使用認可的呼吸器具等。相關的執法分項數字載於附件二。

（二）職安局於二○二二年六月推出「密閉空間安全工作資助計劃2.0」，資助中小企購買合適的安全設備，包括氣體測試設備及動態感應器，並免費提供相關的訓練課程及一站式風險評估。計劃旨在協助中小企提升密閉空間工作安全水平，特別是沙井、污水渠、喉管等工作環境，預防意外。該計劃的詳情及相關統計數字載於附件三。

（三）職安局於二○二二年推出「職安健星級企業—密閉空間安全認可計劃」，旨在為從事密閉空間工作（例如沙井、污水渠、壓力容器／鍋爐、隧道、喉管、水缸）的企業，提供度身訂做的免費職安健顧問服務、培訓課程及資助購買安全裝備，並為職安健表現達到一定水平的企業認證，致力協助業界提升工作安全健康水平，並協助業主或場地管理者識別職安健表現較佳的承辦商。企業成功通過職安局認證後會成為「密閉空間職安健星級企業」，可獲列入星級名冊讓用家識別。該計劃的相關統計數字載於附件四。

（四）勞工處高度關注二○二四年四月二十二日晚在沙田源禾路遊樂場發生涉及渠務工程的致命工作意外。勞工處已迅速完成調查，經徵詢律政司意見後，根據《工廠及工業經營條例》（第59章）及其附屬規例，向有關承建商及分判商提出共43項檢控，有關案件現已進入司法程序。

（五）在上述於沙田源禾遊樂場發生致命意外後，渠務署隨即停止所有清洗污水渠工作並詳細檢視有關的工作流程。渠務署分別於在二○二四年五月三十一日及六月二十八日更新其密閉空間工作相關的實務備考及合約條款，訂明工程如初時預計無須派員進入密閉空間（包括沙井）工作，但後來發現必須派員進入，承建商須立即暫停有關工程、通知渠務署，並按密閉空間工作守則，在完成風險評估和實施相關的安全措施及獲得渠務署批準後，才可進入該密閉空間工作。

（七）除上文所述勞工處與主要負責渠務工程的政府部門和法定機構建立的通報機制之外，勞工處亦已於二零二四年修訂《密閉空間工作的安全與健康工作守則》，並加強相關的宣傳及教育，提升業界的職安健意識。此外，按上述守則作出修訂的密閉空間作業強制性安全訓練課程亦已於二○二四年十一月三十日推行，進一步提升相關工作的安全水平。我們會繼續採取多管齊下的策略，加強巡查執法、宣傳推廣及教育培訓，預防意外發生。"

Question:

 Regarding safety and health at work in confined spaces, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the Code of Practice for Safety and Health at Work in Confined Spaces (CoP) was revised last year by adding, among others, the requirement for proprietors or contractors to record videos at the entrance and exit of the confined spaces throughout the entire work period, of the number of work sites involving confined space operations that have been inspected since the revision of the CoP, and whether any violations of the CoP by proprietors or contractors have been identified during the inspections; if so, of the main nature of such violations, and the numbers of written warnings, suspension notices, and improvement notices issued in response to such violations, as well as the number of prosecutions initiated; among these prosecutions, of the number of convictions and the penalties imposed;

(2) given that the Occupational Safety and Health Council (OSHC) launches the ""OSH Enhancement Scheme for SMEs for Safe Work at Confined Space 2.0"" (Enhancement Scheme) to subsidise eligible small and medium enterprises for purchasing equipment such as gas detectors and man-down alarm devices, of the number of application quotas available under the Enhancement Scheme and the numbers of applications received, approved, and rejected by the OSHC in each of the past three years and this year to date, with a breakdown by nature of business of the enterprise (e.g. drainage services, construction, and mechanical and electrical engineering); of the average amount of subsidy for the approved applications (set out by new applicants and enterprises previously subsidised), and the main reasons for applications being rejected;

(3) given that the OSHC launches the OSH Star Enterprise - Confined Space Safety Accreditation Scheme (Accreditation Scheme) to provide enterprises specialising in confined space work with, among others, occupational safety and health (OSH) consultancy service and subsidies for purchasing safety equipment, of the numbers of enterprise applications received, approved, and currently under vetting by the OSHC under the Accreditation Scheme in each of the past three years and this year to date, with a breakdown by nature of business of the enterprise (e.g. drainage services, construction, and mechanical and electrical engineering); of the average amount of subsidy for the approved applications;

(4) of the progress of the investigation to identify the causes of the fatal industrial accident involving a manhole that occurred on Yuen Wo Road in Sha Tin on April 22 last year, and whether prosecution has been initiated against those held liable for the accident; if so, of the details;

(5) as it is reported that the authorities indicated last year that they would study the possibility of including clauses in sewer cleaning contracts to stipulate that if workers who are originally not supposed to enter a manhole subsequently need to do so, the Drainage Services Department must be informed and its approval had to be obtained in advance, of the progress made in this regard;

(6) given that according to a paper submitted by the Government to the Panel on Manpower of this Council in June 2022, the Labour Department (LD) has established a notification system with key government departments/statutory bodies responsible for drainage works (including the Airport Authority Hong Kong, the Housing Department, the Highways Department and the Drainage Services Department), under which these government departments/statutory bodies will notify the LD of the date and time of all their drainage works or underground pipeworks that require workers to enter confined spaces, so as to facilitate surprise inspections by the LD as appropriate according to a risk-based strategy, of the number of works notified by these government departments/statutory bodies in each year since the establishment of the notification system, and the number of these works that have been inspected by the LD, with a breakdown by the notifying government department/statutory body; during these inspections, whether there are any cases where contractors were found to have violated the CoP and/or relevant OSH legislation (including the Factories and Industrial Undertakings (Confined Spaces) Regulation (Cap. 59AE), the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance (Cap. 59), and the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance (Cap. 509)); if so, of the details, including the number of cases and their nature, as well as the follow-up actions taken, with a breakdown by the notifying government department/statutory body; and

(7) whether it will consider establishing a mandatory reporting mechanism for work in confined spaces, requiring contractors to report prior to commencing higher-risk work in confined space, so as to facilitate the authorities to arrange targeted inspections to enhance the safety of frontline workers?

Reply:

President,

Having consulted the Drainage Services Department (DSD), my consolidated reply to the Hon Chau Siu-chung's question is as follows:

(1) and (6)The Labour Department (LD) conducts inspections of workplaces across the territory from time to time to ensure the safety and health of workers at work. As inspection of work in confined space is an integral part of the LD's routine occupational safety and health inspection, the LD did not specifically keep separate statistics on the number of routine inspection for such workplaces and related enforcement statistics. However, the LD has established a notification mechanism with key Government departments and a statutory body (including Drainage Services Department (DSD), Housing Department, Highways Department and the Airport Authority Hong Kong) responsible for drainage works since 2022. These parties will notify the LD regularly of the date and time of all their drainage works or underground pipeworks that require workers to enter confined spaces so as to facilitate the LD to select those confined space works with higher risk for surprise inspection and enhanced enforcement actions according to a risk-based strategy. Since the establishment of the notification mechanism to May 2025, the LD received a total of 8 608 notifications and conducted 780 inspections. The relevant notification and inspection figures are at Annex 1.

  During surprise inspections of confined space work, the LD personnel will review the relevant procedures and equipment, such as whether risk assessments have been conducted and whether corresponding risk control measures have been implemented, whether workers meet the requirements of training and relevant work experience, and whether workers engaged in underground pipeworks are wearing approved breathing apparatus and appropriate safety harnesses. In addition, since the revised ""Code of Practice for Safety and Health at Work in Confined Spaces"" came into effect on November 30, 2024, the LD personnel will pay particular attention to whether proprietors or contractors have implemented relevant measures in accordance with the Code, including recording videos at the entrances and exits of confined spaces while at work to further protect the occupational safety and health of workers. In the past three years, the LD has issued a total of 13 improvement notices and 136 warning letters to proprietors or contractors in the surprise inspections of workplaces that were notified to the LD through the notification system. The main irregularities involved failure to conduct comprehensive risk assessments, issuance of incomplete work permits, and failure to properly use approved breathing apparatus, etc. The relevant enforcement figures are at Annex 2.

(2)The Occupational Safety and Health Council (OSHC) launched the ""OSH Enhancement Scheme for SMEs for Safe Work at Confined Space 2.0"" in June 2022 to subsidise small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in purchasing appropriate safety equipment, including gas detectors and motion-sensing alarm devices, providing free relevant training courses and offering one-stop risk assessments. The scheme aims to help SMEs enhance safety standards in confined space work, particularly in workplaces such as manholes, sewers, and pipelines, and prevent accidents. Details of the scheme and related statistics are at Annex 3.

(3)The OSHC launched the OSH Star Enterprise - Confined Space Safety Accreditation Scheme in 2022. This scheme aims to provide tailor-made free OSH consultancy services, training courses, and subsidies for purchasing safety equipment to enterprises that have work conducted in confined spaces (such as manholes, sewers, pressure vessels/boilers, tunnels, pipelines, and water tanks). It also certifies enterprises that achieve a certain level of occupational safety and health performance, helping the industry to raise the standard of safety and health at work. Additionally, it facilitates owners or site managers to identify contractors with better occupational safety and health performance. Enterprises that successfully pass OSHC certification will become OSH Star Enterprise - Confined Space and be listed in the OSH Star Enterprise List – Confined Space Safety Accreditation Scheme for users' reference. Relevant statistics for the scheme are at Annex 4.

(4)The LD is highly concerned about the fatal work accident involving drainage works that occurred at Yuen Wo Road Playground in Sha Tin on the night of April 22, 2024. The LD has completed the investigation swiftly. Having consulted the Department of Justice, the LD has initiated a total of 43 prosecutions against the relevant contractor and subcontractor under the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance (Cap. 59) and its subsidiary regulations. The case is now under judicial proceedings.

(5)After the aforementioned fatal accident in Yuen Wo Playground in Sha Tin, the DSD immediately suspended all sewer cleansing work and conducted a detailed review of the relevant work procedure. The DSD updated its practice note and contract provisions related to work in confined space on May 31, 2024 and June 28, 2024, respectively. It is now stipulated that if a workers' entry into a confined space (including manhole) was not expected in project initially but it is found later that such entry is necessary, the contractor must immediately suspend the relevant work and notify the DSD. The contractor shall complete a risk assessment and implement necessary safety requirements in accordance with code of practice of confined space work, and obtain approval from the DSD before entering the confined space to carry out work.

(7)In addition to the above-mentioned notification mechanism established between the LD and the key Government departments and the statutory body responsible for drainage works, the LD also revised the Code of Practice for Safety and Health at Work in Confined Spaces in 2024 and strengthened related publicity and education to raise occupational safety and health awareness within the industry. In addition, the mandatory safety training courses for confined space operations, revised in accordance with the aforementioned Code, was also launched on November 30, 2024, to further enhance the safety standards of related work. We will continue to adopt a multi-pronged strategy, including strengthening inspections and enforcement, publicity and promotion, as well as education and training, to prevent accidents."
LCQ13: Admission of sports professionals,2025-07-02 11:22,2025-07-02 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200290.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Vincent Cheng and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 It has been reported that in recent years, several international and Mainland sports stars have come to Hong Kong for development or settlement one after another through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme (QMAS) or the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS). There are views that Hong Kong possesses the advantage of attracting sports talent, and the Government should further assist sports professionals coming to Hong Kong for development, so as to promote the development of Hong Kong's sports industry. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of overseas and Mainland sports professionals who have applied over the past five years for coming to Hong Kong for development through QMAS and TTPS respectively, and among them, the number of applications approved, together with a breakdown by the sports disciplines in which the professionals are involved; whether it has compiled statistics on the employment status of professionals in Hong Kong in the approved cases;

(2) when sports professionals have come to Hong Kong through QMAS or TTPS, how the Hong Kong Talent Engage will follow up on their development and needs in Hong Kong (including support services and development strategies (if any) provided to such professionals);

(3) as it has been reported that several world-renowned billiard players have become Hong Kong residents one after another through QMAS over the past year, whether the authorities will consider launching further initiatives to assist these billiard players in promoting billiards or developing their careers in billiards in Hong Kong, such as opening billiard saloons or training programs, so as to help Hong Kong become an ""international billiard hub""; and

(4) whether it will consider optimising QMAS or TTPS, or providing incentives (such as providing tax concessions to international sports stars or sports professionals coming to Hong Kong on a short-term or long-term basis), so as to attract more international sports talent to come to Hong Kong for development?

Reply:

President,

 To build Hong Kong into an international hub for high-calibre talent, the Government has been implementing various talent admission schemes with different positioning to proactively trawl for talent with diversified backgrounds to come to Hong Kong to build a quality talent pool for meeting Hong Kong's development needs.

 Among them, the Achievement-based Points Test (APT) under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme (QMAS) aims to attract individuals with exceptional talents or skills, as well as outstanding achievements, to come to Hong Kong for settlement. To be eligible for APT, the applicant must have received an award of exceptional achievement (e.g. Olympic medal, Nobel prize, national/international award) or can show that his/her work has been acknowledged by his/her peers or have contributed significantly to the development of his/her field (e.g. lifetime achievement award from industry). Successful applicants will normally be granted a stay of eight years upon first entry. In the past, the majority of international and Mainland sports celebrities who had won awards in major sports events and had come to Hong Kong for development were admitted through the above channel.

 Our reply to the Member's questions, in consultation with the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and the Immigration Department (ImmD), is as follows:

(1) In the past five years (from 2020 to 2024), among the approved cases that have successfully passed the selection exercise under theQMAS, a total of 42 retired or serving athletes have been approved to come to Hong Kong under theAPT, including Olympic medalists, Asian Games medalists, and winners of other international sports events.

 As the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) aims to attract individuals with high income or full-time bachelor's degree from top universities/institutions around the world, the ImmD does not have the number of applications from retired/serving athletes.

 Persons admitted to Hong Kong under the QMAS or the TTPS are not required to have secured offers of employment before coming to Hong Kong. During the validity period of the first visa, the talent are not required to inform the ImmD when they are employed or have established/joined in business in Hong Kong. When applying for extension of stay, successful applicants under the TTPS are required to provide the ImmD with concrete supporting information and documents to prove that they have been employed or have established/joined in business in Hong Kong so that an extension of stay can be granted. The ImmD does not maintain statistics on the employment situation of successful applicants under the above two schemes when they first arrived in Hong Kong, as well as other statistical breakdowns mentioned in the question.

(2) Since its establishment on October 30, 2023, Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE) has been providing comprehensive one-stop support to talent coming to / staying in Hong Kong under the various talent admission schemes (including theTTPS and theQMAS) through both online and offline means. Apart from providing comprehensive information on living and working in Hong Kong as well as handling enquiries from outside talent through its online platform (www.hkengage.gov.hk), HKTE organises with working partners a variety of online and offline activities such as job fairs, themed seminars, workshops (including Cantonese learning classes) and social integration activities (including Talent+ Volunteer Programme) to share information on entrepreneurship, employment as well as other living tips and to help the incoming talent to settle in Hong Kong and integrate into the city as soon as possible. The online platform is connected to about 90 designated working partners of HKTE to provide recommendations and services in areas such as job seeking, accommodation, education, integrated settlement, banking and insurance, business and corporate services as well as networking and community, through online matching tools.

 Earlier on, many internationally renowned sports professionals (such as Judd Trump, the world's number one snooker player, and Stephon Marbury, former National Basketball Association (NBA) player) have settled in Hong Kong. HKTE has invited them to participate in promotional activities to give first-hand sharing of their reasons for coming to Hong Kong, thereby promoting Hong Kong's unique strengths and development opportunities to attract more global talent with diverse backgrounds to pursue development in Hong Kong.

(3) Several internationally renowned snooker players have settled in Hong Kong, drawing public attention and interest for the sport. The Government will actively promote the development of local billiard sports, maintain connections with top snooker players pursuing development in Hong Kong, and provide appropriate support when needed to foster the development of billiard sports in Hong Kong together.

 The Government is committed to sports development through the five policy objectives of promoting sports in the community, supporting elite sports, maintaining Hong Kong as a centre for major international sports events, enhancing professionalism, and developing sports as an industry. For the promotion of community sports, the Government organises various types of recreation and sports activities and encourages public participation to cultivate a strong sporting culture in the community, helping them develop a healthy lifestyle.

 The Government will continue to devote resources to expand the audience base of sports enthusiasts (including snooker fans) and support the organisation of major sports events through the ""M"" Mark System. The Major Sports Events Committee awarded the ""M"" Mark status to the World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 in March this year. It was the first time for the event to be held outside the United Kingdom. In addition to promoting the development of billiard sports in Hong Kong, the event also underlines Hong Kong's status as the centre for major international sports events.

(4) Hong Kong needs talent from various industries with diverse skills. It is difficult to provide financial incentives or tax benefits to all kinds of talent coming to Hong Kong for development under theQMAS or theTTPS. Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is bestowed with unique advantages of enjoying the strong support of our motherland and being closely connected to the world. In addition, Hong Kong has a strong foundation for success, with institutional strengths such as a world-class business environment, a simple and low tax system, and a highly open and internationalised market. All these strengths make Hong Kong an ideal place for talent looking for personal growth and self-enhancement, as they can bring their innovative ideas to life and make positive changes to the world. Many professionals also choose to base in Hong Kong to explore development opportunities in Mainland China. Relevant bureaux and departments will continue to stay in close touch with industry stakeholders to understand the latest developments and manpower needs of the industries, and continuously improve the measures to trawl for talent, such as providing targeted support with a view to attracting outside talent engaged in specific industries."
立法會十三題：輸入體育專才,2025-07-02 11:22,2025-07-02 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200288.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上鄭泳舜議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

據報近年先後有多位國際及內地體壇名將透過優秀人才入境計劃（優才計劃）或高端人才通行證計劃（高才通計劃）來港發展或定居。有意見認為本港具備匯聚體育人才的優勢，政府應進一步協助來港發展的體育專才，以推動本港體育產業的發展。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年有多少名海外及內地運動或體育專才分別透過優才計劃及高才通計劃申請來港發展，以及當中獲批的個案宗數為何，並按專才所參與的運動項目列出分項數字；有否統計，獲批個案專才在港的就業情況；

（二）體育專才透過優才計劃或高才通計劃來港後，香港人才服務辦公室會如何跟進他們在港的發展和需要（包括曾為該等專才提供的支援服務及發展策略（如有））；

（三）據報過去一年有多位國際知名的桌球運動員先後透過優才計劃成為香港居民，當局會否考慮展開深化工作，協助該等桌球運動員在港推廣桌球或發展桌球事業，例如開辦桌球室或訓練班等，以帶動香港成為「國際桌球之都」；及

（四）會否考慮優化優才計劃或高才通計劃，或提供誘因（例如為短期或長期來港的一些國際體壇名將或體育專才提供稅務優惠），以吸引更多國際體育人才來港發展？

答覆：

主席：

為打造香港成為國際高端人才集聚高地，政府正推行各項不同定位的人才入境計劃，積極招攬多元背景的人才來港，建立優質人才庫以配合香港發展所需。

其中，優秀人才入境計劃（優才計劃）下的「成就計分制」旨在吸引具備超凡才能或技術並擁有傑出成就的人士來港定居，申請人須曾獲得傑出成就獎（例如奧林匹克運動會獎牌、諾貝爾獎、國家／國際獎項），或者可證明其工作得到同業肯定或對所屬界別的發展有重大貢獻（例如有關行業的終生成就獎），才符合「成就計分制」的申請資格。成功獲批的人士一般首次入境可獲准在港逗留八年。過往，絕大部分曾在大型運動賽事獲獎並已來港發展的國際及內地體壇名將，均透過上述渠道獲批來港。

就議員的提問，經諮詢文化體育及旅遊局及入境事務處（入境處）後，現答覆如下：

（一）過去五年（二○二○年至二○二四年），優才計劃下成功通過甄選程序的獲批個案中，共有42名退役或現役運動員按「成就計分制」獲批來港，包括不同運動項目的奧林匹克運動會獎牌得主、亞洲運動會獎牌得主，以及其他國際體育賽事的得獎者。

由於高端人才通行證計劃（高才通計劃）旨在吸納高收入或全球頂尖學府學士畢業的人才，入境處並不掌握來自退役／現役運動員的申請數目。

經優才計劃或高才通計劃來港的人士無須在來港前已在港覓得工作。在首個簽證有效期間，人才如在港受聘或開辦／參與業務，亦無須通知入境處。高才通計劃的獲批申請人在提出延長逗留期限申請時，須向入境處提供可信納的資料及文件，證明已在港受聘或開辦／參與業務，方可獲得續簽。入境處沒有備存上述兩個計劃下獲批申請人剛來港時的就業情況，以及提問涉及的其他分項統計數字。

（二）香港人才服務辦公室（人才辦）自二○二三年十月三十日成立以來，一直以線上及線下形式，為不同人才入境計劃（包括優才計劃及高才通計劃）下來港／留港的人才提供全方位一站式支援。除設有線上平台（www.hkengage.gov.hk）提供有關在港生活及工作的全方位資訊，以及處理人才的查詢外，人才辦與合作夥伴舉辦多元化的線上線下活動，包括招聘會、專題研討會、工作坊（包括粤語學習班），以及社區共融活動（包括人才義工計劃），提供有關不同生活範疇、就業及創業等方面的資訊，協助來港人才落戶香港，以及盡快融入香港生活。線上平台連繫約90家指定合作夥伴，提供網上支援配對服務，在求職、住房、教育、綜合移居、銀行及保險服務、商務及企業服務和社群網絡等方面為人才提供建議和服務。

早前，不少國際知名的體育專才（如世界排名第一的桌球手卓林普（Judd Trump）及前美國職業籃球聯賽球員馬布里（Stephon Marbury））落戶香港，人才辦即邀請他們參與宣傳，親身分享來港的原因，對外宣傳及推廣香港的獨特優勢和發展機遇，吸引更多國際多元人才來港發展。

（三）多位國際知名的桌球運動員來港定居，帶動市民對桌球運動的關注與興趣。政府會積極推動本地桌球運動的發展，與來港發展的桌球名將保持聯繫，並在他們有需要時提供適切支援，攜手促進本地桌球運動的發展。

政府一直致力推動體育發展，積極落實普及化、精英化、盛事化、專業化和產業化五大政策目標。在推廣體育普及化方面，政府透過舉辦多元化的康樂體育活動，鼓勵市民參與，在社區建立熱愛體育的文化，協助他們培養健康生活模式。

政府亦會繼續投放資源，拓展熱愛體育（包括桌球運動）的觀眾群，並透過「M」品牌計劃支援主辦機構舉辦大型體育活動。今年三月，大型體育活動事務委員會向「世界格蘭披治桌球大獎賽2025」頒授「M」品牌認可。這項大賽首次在英國以外的地方舉行，不但有助推動本地桌球發展，而且彰顯香港作為國際體育盛事之都的地位。

（四）香港需要來自各行各業和具備不同技能的人才，難以為所有經優才計劃或高才通計劃來港發展的人才提供財政誘因或稅務優惠。香港在「一國兩制」下，擁有得天獨厚的優勢，既有祖國的強大支持，又與世界緊密相連。此外，香港亦擁有世界一流的營商環境、簡單的低稅制、高度開放的國際化市場等制度優勢，為香港的發展奠定了堅實的基礎。這些優勢也讓香港成為人才尋求個人成長和自我提升的理想之地，他們可以將創新理念付諸實踐，為世界帶來積極的改變。許多專業人士也選擇以香港為基地，探索內地的發展機遇。相關政策局和部門會繼續與行業的持份者保持緊密聯繫，了解行業最新發展及人力需求情況，持續完善招攬人才措施，例如為重點吸納從事特定行業的外來人才，提供針對性的支援。"
LCQ18: Management of Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin,2025-07-02 11:10,2025-07-02 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200291.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Stanley Li and a written reply by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

There are views that the Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin, being an important historical and cultural temple, has a profound history and extensive social influence. Regarding the management of the temple, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that according to the information provided by the Chinese Temples Committee, the annual surplus of the Che Kung Temple for the year ended March 31 last year exceeded $16 million, whether the Government knows the intended specific uses of the surplus, including whether it will be transferred to the General Chinese Charities Fund under the Chinese Temples Ordinance (Cap. 153) or used for community projects in Sha Tin District;

(2) whether it knows, in respect of major decisions relating to the Che Kung Temple (e.g. the expansion project and the adjustment of fees for services provided in the temple), how the Committee seeks the views of worshippers or heritage conservation groups, and whether the Committee has held open meetings or kept records of such consultations on a regular basis; if the Committee has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it knows if the Committee has formulated development strategies for the Che Kung Temple for the next 10 years, including coping with the growth in visitor flow, providing digitalised services (e.g. using a platform for electronic blessings) or implementing environmental protection measures (e.g. reducing the pollution caused by joss sticks); if the Committee has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Chinese Temples Committee is a statutory body established in accordance with the Chinese Temples Ordinance (Cap. 153). At present, there are around 350 temples registered with the Committee or managed by the Committee through different means. The Che Kung Temple, Shatin, is one of the administered temples under the Committee.

I give the reply in response to the question raised by the Hon Stanley Li as follows:

According to the Ordinance, all revenues from the administered temples under the Committee (including the Che Kung Temple) must first be transferred to the Chinese Temples Fund (CTF). The temple keepers of individual administered temples do not have the authority to determine the use of these revenues. The CTF is primarily used for the purposes of organising customary ceremonies and the maintenance of the temple buildings and temple properties and so on. For instance, the Committee has granted fundings under relevant funding schemes to the Ta Chiu Festival Committee of Kau Yeuk of the Sha Tin Rural Committee for organising the decennial Ta Chiu Festival in the Year of Yisi, and to the Sha Tin Rural Committee for organising the Che Kung worshipping event. Any surpluses from the CTF may be transferred to the General Chinese Charities Fund (GCCF), also managed by the Committee, for the purposes of any Chinese charity in Hong Kong. It includes grants to the Home Affairs Department for provision of emergency financial relief to needy persons of Chinese race who are affected by natural disasters or accidents, as well as the GCCF funding scheme supporting charitable activities and projects for the Chinese community in Hong Kong. The use of surpluses from the CTF is also governed by the Ordinance and is not subject to the discretion of the temple keepers of individual administered temples.

The Committee and its working groups render advice on matters relating to the operations of its administered temples (including the Che Kung Temple). Specifically, the Works Working Group under the Committee discusses matters relating to the planning and management of its temples, and submit recommendations to the Committee. For temple maintenance and related matters, the Committee would consult relevant stakeholders as appropriate. For example, the Committee would seek advice from the Antiquities and Monuments Office on works for administered temples under the Committee that are declared monuments. The Committee's meetings are not open to the public, and related documents are therefore not disclosed to the public.

The Committee has all along been keeping abreast of the overall development of temple-related matters, striving to keep up with the times to meet the needs of worshippers and visitors of its administered temples (including the Che Kung Temple). For example, the Committee has made postcards for its six administered temples that are declared monuments and installed debossing stations at these temples for collection by worshippers and visitors. The Committee has also been actively promoting digital services, such as installing a digital wishing board display at the Che Kung Temple in recent years. Besides, during the recent maintenance and repainting of the Che Kung statue, the Committee has introduced naked-eye 3D technology to project images of Che Kung. Furthermore, in respect of environmental protection measures, the Committee is committed to implementing green facilities at its administered temples, including smoke filtration systems and eco-friendly joss paper burners and so on."

問題：

有意見認為沙田車公廟（車公廟）作為重要歷史文化廟宇，具有深厚的歷史底蘊和廣泛的社會影響力。關於該廟的管理，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於根據華人廟宇委員會（委員會）的資料，車公廟截至去年三月三十一日止的年度盈餘超過1,600萬元，政府是否知悉，該盈餘所擬作的具體用途為何，包括會否撥入《華人廟宇條例》（第153章）下的華人慈善基金或用於沙田區的社區項目；

（二）是否知悉就車公廟相關的重大決策（例如擴建工程及廟內的服務收費調整等），委員會如何徵詢善信或文物保護團體的意見，以及有否定期舉行公開會議或備存諮詢紀錄；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）是否知悉委員會有否制定車公廟未來10年的發展戰略，包括應對遊客流量增長、提供數碼化服務（例如使用電子祈福平台）或推行環保措施（例如減少香燭污染）；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

華人廟宇委員會（委員會）是根據《華人廟宇條例》（第153章）（《條例》）成立的法定機構。現時共有約350間廟宇向委員會註冊或由委員會以不同方式管理。沙田車公廟（車公廟）是由委員會管理的其中一間直轄廟宇。

就李世榮議員的提問，現回覆如下：

根據《條例》的規定，委員會轄下所有直轄廟宇（包括車公廟）的收入須先撥入華人廟宇基金，而非由各直轄廟宇的司祝自行決定收入的用途。華人廟宇基金主要用於進行傳統儀式，以及廟宇建築物及其財產的維修等用途。舉例而言，委員會曾在相關資助計劃下撥款資助沙田鄉事委員會九約建醮委員會舉辦沙田鄉事委員會九約十年一屆乙巳年太平清醮，以及資助沙田鄉事委員會舉辦參拜車公活動等。華人廟宇基金的盈餘則可撥入同樣由委員會管理的華人慈善基金，供本港華人慈善活動用途，包括撥款予民政事務總署用作緊急援助金，以幫助受天災或意外影響的本港華人，以及設有華人慈善基金撥款資助計劃，資助本港的華人慈善活動及計劃。華人廟宇基金的盈餘用途也受《條例》規範，同樣也不是由各直轄廟宇的司祝決定。

委員會及其轄下的工作小組會就委員會轄下廟宇（包括車公廟）的運作及相關事宜提供建議。其中，委員會轄下設有工程小組，就委員會轄下廟宇工程的規劃、管理及相關事宜進行討論，並向委員會呈交建議。就廟宇維修工作等事宜而言，委員會會按需要諮詢相關持份者，例如若廟宇屬法定古蹟的話，委員會會諮詢古物古蹟辦事處的意見。委員會的會議不作公開，故相關文件也不會公開。

委員會一直密切留意與廟宇相關的整體發展，致力在各方面與時俱進，以符合到訪各直轄廟宇（包括車公廟）的善信及遊客的需要。舉例而言，委員會就其轄下的六間法定古蹟廟宇印製了法定古蹟廟宇神祇明信片，並在相關廟宇設置壓印，鼓勵善信或遊客到訪收集。委員會亦一直推動數碼化服務，例如近年在車公廟內設立數碼金榜題名顯示屏，並在近月維修及重髹車公廟車公神像期間，引入裸眼3D技術，展示車公元帥的影像。此外，在推行環保措施方面，委員會亦致力在其直轄廟宇引入環保設施，例如淨煙處理系統、環保化寳爐等。"
申訴專員三大策略性方向取得成果　為市民帶來實際裨益（附圖）,2025-07-02 11:00,2025-07-02 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200300.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出︰

申訴專員陳積志今日（七月二日）發表二○二四／二五年度申訴專員年報。在報告年度內，公署在處理查詢、申訴、重新評審和覆檢個案均全部超出服務指標完成。

陳積志說︰「我在去年四月一日履新後，為公署制定了三個策略性方向：（一）積極以調解方式有效和快速地處理市民的申訴；（二）促進跨部門及跨機構的協作，提供高效優質的公共服務；以及（三）在社會層面推動正面和積極的申訴文化。這三個策略性方向旨在提升公共行政質素，為市民帶來實際裨益，同時鼓勵政府和市民共同建設更穩定和諧、不斷進步的社會。」

在年度內，公署成功調解了555宗申訴，接近上年度的三倍，佔已跟進個案的33.5%，刷新了公署的紀錄。而以調解方式結案的申訴個案平均僅需時10.87天，顯著加快為市民紓困排憂。

在促進跨部門跨機構協作方面，在年度內，公署完成了三宗涉及跨部門及機構協作的主動調查行動及成功處理了141宗涉及跨部門及機構協作的個案。

公署全力宣揚「正面看申訴」這個理念，在年度內，除了每年的申訴專員嘉許獎計劃外，亦向16個部門和機構發出共41封嘉許信，以及向申訴人致送了19張感謝狀，以表揚他們對改善公共行政的貢獻。公署亦首次為大學、大專院校舉辦講座，全年為大學和中學舉辦了共13場「正面看申訴」講座。公署正積極籌備成立香港國際申訴專員學院，為政府部門及公營機構提供適切的培訓，提升公署員工的專業能力，並且促進公署與海外申訴機構的交流和合作。

公署在年度內完成了八項主動調查行動及40個全面調查個案，合共提出了254項改善公共行政的建議，較去年建議的總數增加了37%，建議全數獲相關政府部門或機構接納，部分建議亦已獲跟進及落實。由二○二四年十一月起，公署亦對以查訊方式完成處理的個案提出觀點，點出已實行的改善措施或可從速改善之處。截至二○二五年三月三十一日，公署提出了106項觀點均獲相關政府部門和公營機構接納。

公署在本年度接到4 402宗涉及不同課題的申訴個案，並完成處理了4 664宗（連同由上一年度轉入的個案），當中3 009宗經評審後結案，以及1 655宗已跟進並結案。

Ombudsman's three strategic focuses deliver results and tangible benefits to community (with photo),2025-07-02 11:00,2025-07-02 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200298.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

  The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (July 2) presented the 2024-25 Annual Report of The Ombudsman to the public. The Office exceeded all its service targets in handling enquiries, complaints, reassessment and review of complaints in the reporting year.

  Mr Chan said, ""Since assuming office on April 1 last year, I have championed three strategic focuses: (1) enhancing mediation to effectively and swiftly resolve public complaints; (2) fostering interdepartmental collaboration to provide highly efficient and quality public services; and (3) cultivating a positive and proactive complaint culture within the community. These three initiatives are designed to improve the quality of public administration, deliver tangible benefits to our citizens, and encourage the Government and citizens to foster a more stable, harmonious and progressive society for all.""

  In the reporting year, the Office concluded an all-time high of 555 cases by mediation, nearly tripling the number of the previous year and accounting for 33.5 per cent of the cases pursued. Given that the average time taken to resolve a complaint by way of mediation was only 10.87 days, it significantly expedited the process of redressing grievances for the public.

  On the front of fostering interdepartmental collaboration, the Office completed three direct investigation operations and processed 141 complaint cases during the year in this connection.

  The Office has stepped up efforts to cultivate a positive complaint culture. In addition to the annual Ombudsman's Awards Scheme, the Office issued 41 appreciation letters to 16 departments and organisations, and presented 19 appreciation certificates to complainants during the year, recognising their contribution to the enhancement of public administration. For the first time, the Office hosted seminars for universities and tertiary institutes, with a total of 13 seminars held at tertiary and secondary institutes throughout the year to promote a positive complaint culture. The Office is in active preparation for establishing the Hong Kong International Ombudsman Academy to provide appropriate training for government departments and public organisations, enhance the professional capabilities of staff of the Office, and promote exchanges and co-operation between the Office and overseas ombudsman institutions.

  The Office completed eight direct investigation operations and 40 full investigations during the year, delivering a total of 254 recommendations, 37 per cent more compared to that of the previous year, for improvement of public administration. All the recommendations were accepted by the government departments or organisations concerned, including some having been pursued and implemented. From November 2024 onwards, the Office started making observations in cases concluded after inquiries to highlight the improvements that had been or could be put in place more speedily. As at March 31, 2025, 106 observations had been made and were well received by the government departments or public organisations concerned.

  In the reporting year, the Office received 4 402 complaints on various topics and completed 4 664 cases (including some carried over from the preceding year), of which 3 009 were assessed and closed and 1 655 pursued and concluded.

尊敬的梁君彥主席（立法會主席）、各位議員、各位秘書處和政府的同事：

大家好。今天我很高興能參與立法會圖書館優化設施及服務的啟用儀式。

與我們平時熟悉的圖書館有些不同，立法會圖書館作為憲制圖書館，超過一半的館藏都與憲制及議會有關。自二○一二年立法會綜合大樓啟用以來，立法會圖書館一直為使用者提供不同資源，幫助他們了解立法會的職能、工作和歷史，以至內地和其他地方的憲制制度發展。

立法會一直精益求精，去年底通過一系列圖書館設施及服務的優化建議，打造一個現代化的圖書館。經優化的圖書館除了有舒適的閱讀區及很多政策藏書外，剛才主席亦有提到，亦增設了科技創意空間，配備3D打印機、航拍無人機及虛擬實境裝置，為訪客帶來嶄新的體驗，令圖書館也可以很有活力，經驗可以很不一樣。這些創新設施不但提升了圖書館的功能與吸引力，亦有助公眾更深入了解立法會的工作。

優化後的圖書館亦設有一個全新的專題展覽空間。剛才主席亦有提到，打響頭炮的展覽以「行政立法關係」為主題，回顧香港百多年來行政與立法關係的演變，我覺得非常有意義。

我們在國家的大力支持下，成功落實「愛國者治港」。無論是審議法案和撥款建議、或是為政策措施出謀獻策，現在的立法會議員都以理性、務實的方式議政，實事求是、分秒必爭。在香港邁向「由治及興」的新征程上，政府會繼續和立法會攜手合作，堅持互相尊重，持續良性互動，為市民謀幸福，為香港謀發展，這是我們最重要的目標。

最後，我要再次恭賀立法會順利完成優化圖書館的工程，期待我們更多的年輕人、一般市民，甚至是來自世界各個地方的遊客，都能親身來體驗香港特區立法會的好故事。謝謝大家。"

駐滬辦主任蔡亮致辭時表示，特區政府全力發展經濟，取得亮麗的成績。她鼓勵上海和華東地區的民眾和企業未來繼續用好香港「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，在香港探索不同的商機、開展投資、就業創業。她亦期望滬港兩地未來在經貿、創科、文化、青年發展等多個方面繼續鼎力合作，共赴雙贏。

蔡亮提到，明年將會是駐滬辦成立二十周年，她感謝上海市委和市政府對特區政府以及駐滬辦工作的大力支持。駐滬辦會繼續為滬港合作提供助力，支持兩地共創雙贏，為國家高質量發展作出更大貢獻。

正在上海訪問的警務處副處長（管理）陳俊燊今日亦出席晚宴，他致辭時表示，每次回歸慶典都是一個重溫「一國兩制」的發展和成果的機會。隨着香港國安雙法出台，香港踏上由亂到治丶由治及興的新征程，這都説明「一國兩制」的制度優勢和強大生命力。他指出國家不斷給予香港機會，發揮背靠祖國，聯通世界的獨特優勢，促進內地與國際的雙向流動。

SHETO celebrates 28th anniversary of establishment of HKSAR in Shanghai (with photos),2025-07-01 22:00,2025-07-01 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/01/P2025070100318.htm,"To celebrate the 28th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Shanghai (SHETO) hosted a dinner reception in Shanghai today (July 1), attended by approximately 180 representatives from Shanghai's government departments, institutions, chambers of commerce, enterprises, and Hong Kong community groups.

Delivering a speech at the dinner reception, the Director of the SHETO, Mrs Laura Aron, highlighted that the HKSAR Government has focused on economic development, achieving remarkable results. She encouraged citizens and enterprises in Shanghai and the East China region to continue leveraging Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"" to explore business opportunities, invest, and pursue employment or entrepreneurship in Hong Kong. She also expressed hope for continued robust co-operation between Shanghai and Hong Kong in areas such as trade, innovation, culture, and youth development, fostering mutual benefits.

Mrs Aron mentioned that next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the SHETO. She expressed gratitude to the Communist Party of China Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government for their support for the work of the HKSAR Government and the SHETO. The SHETO will continue to facilitate Shanghai-Hong Kong co-operation and support mutual success to make greater contributions to the country's high-quality development.

The Deputy Commissioner of Police (Management), Mr Chan Joon-sun, who is visiting Shanghai, attended the dinner. Speaking at the dinner reception, he shared that each anniversary occasion is an opportunity to review the development and achievements of ""one country, two systems"". With the introduction of the dual legislation on national security, Hong Kong has embarked on a new journey, advancing from chaos to order, and from stability to prosperity. It demonstrates the institutional advantages and strong vitality of ""one Country, two systems"". The country has been providing Hong Kong with opportunities to leverage its unique advantage of having strong support from the motherland and close connection with the world, promoting two-way exchanges between the mainland and the international community.

Hong Kong member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Shanghai and Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of New Frontier Group, Mr Carl Wu, also shared remarks at the dinner on Shanghai's support for Hong Kong-invested enterprises and the exchanges between Shanghai and Hong Kong.

The SHETO also invited emerging Hong Kong young artists to perform at the dinner reception, showcasing Hong Kong's diverse cultural charm through a suona performance blending Chinese and Western elements. Several Hong Kong students in Shanghai were also invited to showcase their talents.

The theme of the dinner reception was ""Multifaceted Hong Kong, Infinite Possibilities"", featuring interactive exhibition areas and photo check-in points themed around nine tourism development projects recently announced by the Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, alongside the giant pandas gifted by the Central Government as design ideas, offering guests an immersive, multifaceted, and engaging experience of Hong Kong.

The SHETO, in collaboration with Invest Hong Kong, also organised a seminar entitled ""Hong Kong: Enabler of Mainland Catering and Food Enterprises to Go Global"" today. Insights on the competitive advantages and development opportunities of Hong Kong as a preferred place for business were shared with over 100 representatives from catering, food and other industrial sectors in the East China region. They were encouraged to set up business in and develop overseas markets through Hong Kong."
