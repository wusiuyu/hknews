Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-15 19:58,2025-10-15 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500806.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 15), three new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.
ã
Latest cases information

The first case involves a 77-year-old male living in Eastern District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Guangzhou in Guangdong between September 30 and October 13. He developed a fever and joint pain on October 13, and rash yesterday (October 14). He then sought medical attention at a private hospital. His household contact, who travelled with him to Guangzhou, is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

The second case involves a 34-year-old male living on Lantau Island. A preliminary investigation revealed that he travelled alone to Indonesia between October 2 and 4. He also travelled to Macao between October 6 and 7, and Shenzhen and Dongguan in Guangdong between October 10 and 12. He developed a fever, joint pain and rash on October 13. He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of North Lantau Hospital yesterday. He has two household contacts. His travel companions included his relatives (including one household contact) and colleagues. All are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

The third case involves a 72-year-old male living alone in Central and Western District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Foshan in Guangdong alone between October 4 and 12. He developed a fever and joint pain on October 13 and sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Mary Hospital yesterday.

All three males were admitted to the hospitals for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and are in stable condition. Their blood samples tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing. Since they visited areas affected by CF during their incubation periods, the CHP considered that they were infected during travel. The cases were classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigations are ongoing, and it has reported the cases to relevant health authorities.

Latest surveillance data

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 38 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.ãã

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

 â
The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD.

​政府歡迎立法會通過《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》,2025-10-15 19:38,2025-10-15 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500614.htm,"政府歡迎立法會今日（十月十五日）通過《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》，是引入網約車服務規管制度、為市民提供更安全可靠及多元的個人化點對點交通服務的一個重要里程碑。

《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例》（《條例》）引入網約車服務的規管框架，訂明提供網約車服務的平台、車輛及司機三方均須領取牌照或許可證。持有網約車服務牌照的平台須維持適當且具效率的服務，並對旗下車輛和司機進行盡職審查。網約車車輛須符合各項條件，包括須持有合適的第三者風險保險、符合有關車齡和驗車的要求，以及遵從「人車綁定」的規定——即車輛須以個人名義登記並由登記車主駕駛以提供網約車載客服務。網約車司機亦須符合指定條件，例如年滿21歲、五年內無嚴重交通定罪紀錄等，並通過相關考核。

除了規管網約車服務外，《條例》亦加強了與非法取酬載客相關的罰則和安排，包括訂明被定罪的司機須被取消駕駛資格不少於12個月（最長可達三年），以及強化暫時吊銷相關車輛牌照及扣押車輛的安排，讓執法機關在未能識辨涉事司機以作出刑事檢控的情況下，仍可扣押涉案車輛，以進一步打擊非法取酬載客活動。

運輸及物流局局長陳美寶表示：「特區政府決心引入規管網約車服務的法律框架，處理多年來有關網約車的爭議，為市民提供更多安全合法的出行選擇，同時推動點對點行業現代化和年輕化，實現市民、的士、網約車共贏。」

她續說：「《條例》是政府踏出立法工作的重要一步，透過先確立規管的原則性事宜，為下一階段訂定技術細節奠定堅實的法律基礎。我們隨即會着手推進下一步的工作，包括與持份者聚焦討論磋商，並透過附屬法例和牌證要求訂定各項規管細節。我們會繼續聆聽各方的意見和建議，務求做到『以民為本，多方共贏』。」

《條例》將於十月二十四日刊憲。政府計劃在明年上半年將訂定規管細節的附屬法例提交立法會審議，以期在明年年中完成相關立法程序。視乎獲發網約車服務牌照的平台的籌備工作，預計持牌網約車平台可於明年第四季內開始營運。"
Government welcomes passage of Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025,2025-10-15 19:38,2025-10-15 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500726.htm,"  The Government welcomed the passage of the Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-Hailing Service) Bill 2025 today (October 15), which marks a significant milestone in introducing a regulatory regime for ride-hailing services, providing the public with safer, more reliable, and diverse personalised point-to-point transport services.

  The Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Ordinance 2025 (the Ordinance) introduces a regulatory framework for ride-hailing services, requiring platforms, vehicles, and drivers providing ride-hailing services to obtain licences or permits. Platforms holding ride-hailing service licences must maintain proper and efficient services and conduct due diligence on their vehicles and drivers. Ride-hailing vehicles must meet various requirements, including holding appropriate third-party risk insurance, complying with the requirements on the age and inspection of vehicles, and being linked to the driver (i.e. the vehicle must be registered in the name of an individual and be driven by its registered owner to provide ride-hailing passenger services). Also, ride-hailing vehicle drivers must meet specified conditions, such as being at least 21 years old, having no serious traffic convictions within the past five years, and have passed a relevant test.

ããIn addition to regulating ride-hailing services, the Ordinance also strengthens penalties and arrangements related to illegal carriage of passengers for reward. This includes specifying that convicted drivers should be disqualified from driving for not less than 12 months (and not more than three years), and strengthening arrangements for the temporary suspension of vehicle licences and vehicle impoundments, enabling enforcement agencies to impound vehicles involved, even if the driver involved cannot be identified for the purpose of instituting criminal proceedings, thereby further combating illegal carriage of passengers for reward.

ããThe Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, said, ""The Government is determined to introduce a legal framework for regulating ride-hailing services. This will address the long-standing controversies surrounding such services and provide the public with more travel options that are safer and lawful, while promoting the modernisation and rejuvenation of the point-to-point transport trade, thereby achieving a win-win situation for the public, taxis and ride-hailing services.
ãã
  ""The Ordinance represents a crucial step forward in the Government's legislative work. By first establishing the fundamental regulatory principles, it lays a solid legal foundation for establishing the technical details in the next stage. We will immediately proceed with the next stage of work, including discussing in a focused manner with stakeholders and finalising the regulatory details through subsidiary legislation and licence/permit conditions. We will continue to listen to the views and suggestions from all parties, with a view to adopting a 'people-oriented and win-win' approach,"" she added.

  The Ordinance will be gazetted on October 24. The Government plans to submit the subsidiary legislation detailing regulatory requirements to the Legislative Council for scrutiny in the first half of next year, with a view to completing the relevant legislative procedures in mid-2026. Subject to the preparatory work of the platforms that are granted ride-hailing service licences, it is expected that the licensed platforms may commence operations in the fourth quarter of next year."
​立法會六題：「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」,2025-10-15 19:31,2025-10-15 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500688.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上吳秋北議員的提問和署理醫務衞生局局長范婉雯醫生的答覆︰

問題：

政府於去年六月推出「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」（「試點計劃」），以擴大長者醫療券適用範圍至粵港澳大灣區（「大灣區」）內合適的醫療機構。現時試點計劃已擴展至大灣區九個內地城市，今年八月更新增五試點醫療機構至共有21個服務點，進一步提升跨境醫療服務的覆蓋範圍。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於醫務衞生局局長早前表示，政府正循序漸進考慮將「長者醫療券」計劃擴展至福建省，有關的構思、具體安排及時間表為何；

（二）至今透過試點計劃於大灣區使用醫療券的香港長者人數及人次為何，並按城市及醫療機構列出分項數字；政府有否分析有關的使用率及使用趨勢；及

（三）在推行試點計劃時，特區政府有否與內地相關部門在醫療紀錄互通、付款流程、醫療爭議解決機制、收集長者反饋等方面，建立協調機制，並制訂具體協議或合作安排？

答覆：

主席：

政府自二○○九年起推行長者醫療券計劃（醫療券計劃），目的是為長者提供財政誘因，通過提供部分資助，讓他們選擇最切合自己健康需要的私營基層醫療服務。每名合資格長者現時每年可獲發2,000元長者醫療券（醫療券），累積上限為8,000元。計劃的支出由二○一四至一五年度的6.82億元，增加到二○二四至二五年度的34.24億元。二○二五至二六年度的預算開支約41.5億元。截至二○二五年九月底，超過179萬名合資格長者曾經使用醫療券。

就吳秋北議員的提問，經諮詢衞生署後，我現在回覆如下：

（一）政府近年積極推動大灣區醫療合作，為讓合資格香港長者在大灣區有更多服務點選擇，提供更大的便利和靈活性善用醫療券使用基層醫療服務，政府在二○二四年推行「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」（「試點計劃」），在同年六月開始分階段擴大醫療券適用範圍至七間位於大灣區的綜合醫療／牙科服務機構，覆蓋廣州、中山、東莞和深圳，其中深圳設有兩家指定牙科專科診所，以回應長者對牙科服務的需求。因應香港社會對「試點計劃」的正面反應，政府在今年五月宣布擴展「試點計劃」，新增12間醫療機構至大灣區九個內地城市，並於八月圓滿達成目標。連同香港大學深圳醫院（港大深圳醫院）一院兩點，合資格長者可在大灣區內地城市合共21個服務點使用醫療券。

「試點計劃」擴展至大灣區內地九市全覆蓋標誌着政策創新及兩地醫療合作的又一里程碑。「試點計劃」現尚在初期運作階段，我們會持續評估及監測醫療券在試點醫療機構的運作及使用、適時檢討「試點計劃」的成效之後再研究下一步安排。

（二）為確保醫療券能繼續有效支援推行基層醫療的政策目的，醫療券的適用範圍和使用原則在「試點計劃」與香港和港大深圳醫院計劃大致相同。截至二○二五年九月底，超過23 300名合資格長者曾在「試點計劃」下醫療機構使用醫療券支付門診醫療護理服務費用，涉及48 538宗交易，申領交易總額約5,599萬港元。合資格長者在各試點醫療機構使用醫療券的情況載於附件。「試點計劃」自推出以來，使用率穩步上升，使用醫療券的服務類別主要為跟進／監察慢性病症（52%）及預防（23%）。由於「試點計劃」現尚在運作初期，部份試點醫療機構運作只有數個月，尚需時間觀察，我們會持續評估及監測醫療券在試點醫療機構的運作及使用，然後再進一步分析相關數據。

（三）為確保公帑得以妥善運用，衞生署設有嚴謹的監管機制，查核和審核醫療券計劃的醫療券申報。現行的監管機制，包括例行查核、監察和調查異常的交易模式，以及審核醫療券申報等的措施，同樣適用於港大深圳醫院和參與「試點計劃」的醫療機構。衞生署已與廣東省衞生當局建立機制，在有需要時廣東省衞生當局會為署方提供協助，藉以提升監察成效。政府會繼續與廣東省衞生當局保持緊密聯繫，確保監察機制在試點醫療機構能順利實施。衞生署長者醫療券計劃一直有提供電話熱線及電郵等渠道給予香港長者對醫療券使用服務及「試點計劃」醫療機構提出查詢或投訴。衞生署會根據投訴性質，嚴肅跟進所有懷疑違反醫療券計劃規定，並採取適當跟進措施。

此外，衞生署與所有試點醫療機構均已簽訂服務協議，當中涵蓋及清楚列明正確使用醫療券的相關守則，以及財務、系統對接等安排。政府已與各試點醫療機構落實服務協議下的相關安排，自二○二四年六月推行「試點計劃」至今，19間試點醫療機構均運作暢順。

現時內地醫療機構受當地嚴格監管，不論是臨床醫療服務質素，以至價格收費水平都有嚴格監管。「試點計劃」下每間醫療機構均設有查詢或投訴熱線，香港長者如就試點醫療機構有投訴，包括醫療事故，可按不同的渠道（包括電話或電郵）向相關醫療機構直接提出，或在有需要時向省或市級衞生當局就「試點計劃」下醫療機構作出投訴，有關的醫療機構及當地監管機構會跟進處理。衞生署亦已整合有關投訴舉報途徑的資料，並上載於醫療券計劃網頁方便公眾參考。

就醫療紀錄方面，政府一直與內地相關部門保持溝通聯繫，以符合香港與內地法規、保障數據安全及病人私隱為大原則，推進跨境醫療紀錄互通。其中，政府已於港大深圳醫院和19間試點醫療機構推行醫健通流動應用程式的「跨境健康紀錄」及「個人資料夾」兩項功能，在自攜病歷的原則下，便利長者安全地於跨境使用電子健康紀錄，獲取更連貫的護理服務。政府會根據推展經驗進一步理順流程及提升用戶體驗，務求更有效地支援市民的跨境醫療需求。"
LCQ6: Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme,2025-10-15 19:31,2025-10-15 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500689.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Stanley Ng and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Health, Dr Cecilia Fan, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

The Government launched the Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme (the Pilot Scheme) in June last year to extend the coverage of the Elderly Health Care Vouchers (EHCVs) to suitable medical institutions in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). The Pilot Scheme has now been extended to nine Mainland cities in GBA, with the number of service points increased to a total of 21 after the addition of five pilot medical institutions in August this year, further enhancing the coverage of cross-boundary healthcare services. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as the Secretary for Health has previously indicated that the Government is considering progressively extending the Elderly Health Care Voucher Scheme to Fujian Province, of the relevant idea, specific arrangements and timetable;

(2) of the number, and the number of person-times, of Hong Kong elderly persons who have used EHCVs in GBA under the Pilot Scheme to date, with a breakdown by city and medical institution; whether the Government has analysed the relevant utilisation rates and trends; and

(3) whether, during the implementation of the Pilot Scheme, the SAR Government has established a coordination mechanism with the relevant Mainland authorities in respect of the sharing of medical records, payment procedures, medical dispute resolution mechanisms, the collection of feedback from the elderly, etc, and formulated specific agreements or cooperation arrangements?

Reply:

President,

The Government launched the Elderly Health Care Voucher Scheme (EHVS) in 2009 which aims at providing financial incentives, through offering partial subsidies, for elderly persons to choose private primary healthcare (PHC) services that best suit their health needs. Each eligible elderly person is currently provided with an annual Elderly Health Care Voucher (EHCV) amount of $2,000, with the accumulation limit of $8,000. The expenditure for the EHVS increased from $682 million in 2014-15 to $3.424 billion in 2024-25. The estimated expenditure for the EHVS in 2025-26 is $4.15 billion. As at end-September 2025, over 1.79 million eligible elderly persons have used EHCVs.

In consultation with the Department of Health (DH), my reply to the question raised by the Hon Stanley Ng is as follows:

(1) The Government has been actively promoting healthcare collaboration in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) in recent years. In order to provide eligible Hong Kong elderly persons with more choices of service points in the GBA, and to offer them more convenience and flexibility to better use their EHCVs on PHC services, the Government launched the Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme (Pilot Scheme) in 2024. Since June of the same year, the coverage of EHCVs has been extended by phases to seven integrated medical/dental institutions in the GBA, covering Guangzhou, Zhongshan, Dongguan and Shenzhen; among them are two designated dental institutions in Shenzhen for addressing the demand of elderly persons for dental services. In view of the positive responses from the Hong Kong community on the Pilot Scheme, the Government announced the extension of the Pilot Scheme in May this year to include 12 additional medical institutions to cover nine Mainland cities in the GBA, and the goal was fully achieved in August. Together with the two existing service points operated by the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital (HKU-SZH), eligible elderly persons can use EHCVs at a total of 21 service points in the Mainland cities in the GBA.

The extension of the Pilot Scheme to full coverage of nine Mainland cities in the GBA marks another milestone in policy innovation and medical collaboration between the two places. The Pilot Scheme is still in its initial operation period, we will continue to assess and monitor the operation and usage of EHCVs in the pilot medical institutions and review the effectiveness of the Pilot Scheme in due course before studying further arrangements.

(2) To ensure that EHCVs can effectively continue the policy objective of supporting the implementation of PHC services, the scope and principles of the use of EHCVs under the Pilot Scheme are generally identical to those in Hong Kong and under the HKU-SZH scheme. As at end-September 2025, over 23 300 eligible elderly persons have used EHCVs to pay for the fees of outpatient healthcare services received at medical institutions under the Pilot Scheme, involving 48 538 voucher claim transactions and a total claimed amount at approximately HK$55.99 million. The usage of EHCVs by eligible elderly persons at various pilot medical institutions are set out at Annex. Since the launch of the Pilot Scheme, the utilisation rate has been rising steadily. The service types for using the EHCVs are mainly ""follow up/monitoring of long-term conditions"" (52 per cent) and ""preventive"" (23 per cent). The Pilot Scheme is still in its initial operation period and some of the pilot medical institutions have operated for only a few months, requiring more time for further observation. We will continue to assess and monitor the operation and usage of EHCVs in the pilot medical institutions before further analysing relevant data.

(3) To ensure the proper use of public money, the DH adopts a robust monitoring mechanism for checking and auditing voucher claims under the EHVS. The existing monitoring mechanism, which includes measures such as routine checking, monitoring and investigating in respect of aberrant transactions, as well as auditing voucher claims, is also applicable to the HKU-SZH and medical institutions participating in the Pilot Scheme. The DH has also established a mechanism with the health authority of Guangdong Province, through which the health authority of Guangdong Province will provide assistance to the DH when necessary, with a view to enhancing its monitoring capabilities. The Government will continue to maintain close contact with the health authority of Guangdong Province to ensure the smooth implementation of the monitoring mechanism in the pilot medical institutions. The DH provides channels such as telephone hotline and email under the EHVS to Hong Kong elderly persons for making enquiries or complaints on the use of EHCVs and medical institutions under the Pilot Scheme. Based on the nature of complaints, the DH will strictly deal with all suspected cases of violating the EHVS rules and take appropriate follow-up measures.

In addition, the DH has signed service agreements with all pilot medical institutions, which cover and state clearly the relevant practices on the appropriate use of EHCVs, as well as the arrangements on financial matters and system configurations, etc. The Government has collaborated with all pilot medical institutions to finalise the relevant arrangements under the service agreement. All 19 pilot medical institutions have been operating smoothly since the launch of the Pilot Scheme in June 2024.

Currently, Mainland medical institutions, including the quality of clinical services and the fees charged, are subject to strict supervision by relevant local authorities. Each medical institution under the Pilot Scheme has set up its own enquiry or complaint hotline. Hong Kong elderly persons can make use of different channels (including telephone hotline or email) to directly file any complaints, including medical incidents, regarding the pilot medical institutions, or lodge complaints against the medical institutions under the Pilot Scheme to the health authority at the provincial or municipal level if necessary. The relevant medical institution and the local regulatory authorities will follow up on the matter. The DH has also consolidated relevant information on the channels for reporting or lodging complaints, and uploaded the details to the EHVS website for public reference.

Regarding medical records, the Government has been maintaining close liaison with the relevant Mainland authorities to take forward the sharing of cross-boundary medical records , in accordance with the overarching principles of ensuring due compliance of laws and regulations of Hong Kong and the Mainland and that data security and patients' privacy are fully safeguarded. In particular, the Government launched two eHealth App functions, namely ""Cross-boundary Health Record"" and ""Personal Folder"", at the HKU-SZH and the 19 medical institutions under the Pilot Scheme, which will facilitate elderly persons to securely use their electronic health records across the boundary under the principle of ""bring your own health records"", thereby enhancing the continuity of care. Taking into account the implementation experience, the Government will further streamline the workflow and enhance the user experience, with the aim to support citizens' cross-boundary healthcare needs more effectively."

  The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, officiated at the ceremony and presented the HKSAR regional flag to the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Head of the HKSAR Delegation, Miss Rosanna Law. The supporting organisations were also presented with certificates of appreciation during the ceremony.
  
  Organised by the General Administration of Sport of China once every four years, the NG is the country's highest-level and largest national multi-sport event. The 15th NG, featuring 34 competition events and 23 mass participation events, with the latter covering 19 sports for competition and four sports for demonstration, will be held in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao from November 9 to 21 this year.
  
  Speaking at the event, Miss Law said that Hong Kong has participated in the NG eight times since its return to the motherland. In the last NG held in Shaanxi in 2021, the results of the Hong Kong team were very encouraging, achieving a total of seven medals, namely two golds and five bronzes. In recent years, Hong Kong athletes have accomplished outstanding results in various major international competitions and made historic achievements by capturing two gold medals and two bronze medals at the Paris Olympic Games last year, injecting strong impetus into the development of Hong Kong’s sports. This not only reflects that the skills of athletes have been on the rise, but also shows that the HKSAR Government is moving in the right direction in training elite athletes. At the same time, it demonstrates the results of the joint efforts of the Government and various sectors of the community in promoting the development of sports over the years.
  
  The Delegation participating in this year's NG is the largest ever, with over 600 athletes and about 270 team officials and medical personnel taking part in 28 competition events.

CHP investigates confirmed Mpox case,2025-10-15 19:00,2025-10-15 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500749.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) said today (October 15) that it is investigating a confirmed Mpox (also known as Monkeypox) case, and urged the public to be vigilant and avoid close physical contact with persons suspected of contracting Mpox. Meanwhile, high-risk target groups are advised to receive Mpox vaccinations.

The case involves a 41-year-old male. He developed a fever and skin pustules on October 6 and 8 respectively. He attended the Wan Chai Male Social Hygiene Clinic of the DH on October 10. He is being isolated at Princess Margaret Hospital and is in stable condition.

  According to the patient, he visited Taiwan during the incubation period. No epidemiological linkages between this case and other confirmed cases recorded in Hong Kong earlier could be identified so far. The CHP is continuing its epidemiological investigations of the case and will report the case to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the health authority of Taiwan.

Hong Kong has put in place the Preparedness and Response Plan for Mpox since June 2022 and activated the alert response level under the Plan after the first confirmed case of Mpox in September of the same year. The CHP has implemented a series of measures (including enhanced surveillance, contact tracing, public education and vaccination), which have been effective in preventing local outbreaks of Mpox in the past three years.

Since 2022, a total of 80 Mpox cases (65 local and 15 imported) have been recorded in Hong Kong, of which 12 cases were recorded this year. All the patients were male. Epidemiological investigations revealed that most cases had history of high-risk sexual behaviours, including having sex with strangers or without wearing condoms when having sex. Hong Kong has not yet detected any new Mpox strain (Clade Ib) cases.

The CHP reminded high-risk target groups to receive Mpox vaccinations in order to lower the risk of infection or the possibility of having more severe symptoms after infection. In addition, persons who experience Mpox symptoms (including rashes, fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, exhaustion, muscle pain, and severe headaches) or suspect themselves of being infected are advised to seek medical attention and receive treatment at once. They should not engage in activities with others that may expose others to their skin rash or body fluids. Members of the public should maintain good personal and hand hygiene to prevent virus transmission or infection through contact. They should also avoid close physical contact with persons or animals suspected of being infected.

The CHP has set up an Mpox telephone hotline (2125 2373), which operates from Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm, excluding public holidays. Those who suspect or are concerned that they may have had high-risk contact with confirmed cases, particularly men who have sex with men or those who have sexual practices with strangers, can use the hotline to make enquiries and receive relevant health advice.

Furthermore, the DH provides vaccination services to high-risk groups of Mpox. The following high-risk target groups are eligible for Mpox vaccinations on a voluntary basis:


individuals with high-risk sexual practices, e.g. having multiple sexual partners, sex workers, or having a history of sexually transmitted infection within the past 12 months;
healthcare workersresponsible forcaring forpatients with confirmed Mpox;
laboratory personnel working with zoonotic pox viruses; and
animal care personnel with high risk of exposure in case of Mpox occurrences in animals in Hong Kong.


  High-risk target groups can receive Mpox walk-in vaccinations at any of the DH's Social Hygiene Service Clinics (SocHS) (namely Chai Wan SocHS, Wan Chai Male SocHS, Wan Chai Female SocHS, Yau Ma Tei Male SocHS, Yau Ma Tei Female SocHS, Yung Fung Shee SocHS, Fanling SocHS and Tuen Mun SocHS) and the DH's Yau Ma Tei Integrated Treatment Centre.

Meanwhile, the DH's Kowloon Bay Integrated Treatment Centre and the Hospital Authority's Special Medical Clinics at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital also provide Mpox vaccination services for their clients.

  As the responsible unit for planning and building the core IT systems and network infrastructure for the Hong Kong competition region, the DPO completed the development and testing of related IT systems in September. This tabletop exercise focused on simulating potential emergency IT incidents and urgent situations that may occur during the events, aiming to test the mobilisation efficiency of the participating departments and the effectiveness of the interdepartmental communication mechanism. Participating units included the National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong), the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau of the Hong Kong Police Force, the IT system contractors, and cybersecurity experts. Through diverse simulated scenarios, the exercise enhanced co-ordination and rapid response capabilities among the departmental teams, ensuring the smooth and safe operation of the events.

  The Commissioner for Digital Policy, Mr Tony Wong, said, ""The 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG are important missions entrusted to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by the country. We must spare no effort in providing solid IT support to ensure the successful hosting of this national sports event. This cross-departmental tabletop exercise simulated the core system challenges, infrastructure issues, and cybersecurity emergencies that may arise during the events, verifying the feasibility of contingency plans and the efficiency of team collaboration. The DPO will adhere to the principles of 'respond instantly, resume rapidly' to ensure 'zero interruptions to the operation of the events.'"" He also sincerely thanked all participating units for their full support and active collaboration, which contributed to the success of the exercise.

  In addition, the DPO is currently intensifying final joint system testing with the responsible units in both Guangdong Province and Macao counterparts before the Games to ensure seamless integration of systems across the three places, while enhancing cross-boundary co-ordination and emergency response capabilities in system operations and cybersecurity to make preparations for the events.

  The 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG will be cohosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao for the first time. The DPO will release a series of short videos during the events through its Facebook page (www.facebook.com/digitalpolicyhk) to help the public gain a deeper understanding of how information technology supports this national large-scale event."

It encourages the alignment of classroom education with industry needs and collaboration between businesses and education institutions, thereby providing diversified learning and employment opportunities and nurturing more high-quality talent with applied skills. Dr Choi said she expected to learn from the experiences of other regions in promoting VPET during the visit, and she was also pleased to see Hong Kong and Sichuan Province strengthen exchanges and co-operation in areas such as skilled talent cultivation and industry-education collaboration.

Dr Choi will call on the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government tomorrow morning (October 16) and then conclude her visit and return to Hong Kong."
衞生防護中心調查一宗猴痘確診個案,2025-10-15 19:00,2025-10-15 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500750.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月十五日）表示，正調查一宗猴痘確診個案，並提醒市民提高警覺，避免與懷疑感染猴痘的人士作密切身體接觸，同時強烈建議高風險目標群組人士接種猴痘疫苗。

個案涉及一名41歲男子。他於十月六日出現發燒，十月八日皮膚出現膿皰，十月十日到衞生署灣仔男性社會衞生科診所求診。病人現於瑪嘉烈醫院進行隔離，情況穩定。

根據病人提供的資料，他於潛伏期內曾到訪台灣。中心暫未發現任何資料顯示這宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他猴痘確診個案有流行病學關連。中心正繼續就個案進行流行病學調查，並會將個案通報世界衞生組織（世衞）及台灣衞生當局。

香港自二○二二年六月起已制定猴痘準備及應變計劃，並於同年九月出現首宗猴痘確診個案後，啓動該計劃下的戒備級別。中心實施的一系列措施（包括加強個䅁監測、接觸者追蹤、公眾教育和疫苗接種等）在過去三年有效防止猴痘在本地出現爆發。

自二○二二年起至今，本港共錄得80宗猴痘個案（65宗本地個案和15宗輸入個案），當中12宗於今年錄得，全部病人均為男性。流行病學調查顯示，絕大部分個案曾進行高風險性行為，包括與陌生人發生性行為或在沒有佩戴安全套的情況下進行性行為。香港至今未有發現新型猴痘病毒株（分支Ib型）的個案。

中心提醒高風險目標群組人士應接種猴痘疫苗，以減低感染或感染後出現較嚴重病徵的機會。此外，出現猴痘症狀（包括皮疹、發燒、發冷、淋巴結腫大、疲乏、肌肉痛及劇烈頭痛等）或懷疑自己受感染的人士應立即求醫並接受治療，不應與其他人進行可能接觸到皮疹或體液的活動。市民亦應時刻保持良好個人及手部衞生，預防經接觸傳播或感染病毒，並避免與懷疑感染猴痘的人或動物作密切身體接觸。

中心設有猴痘電話熱線（2125 2373），逢星期一至五（公眾假期除外）上午九時至下午五時運作。任何人懷疑或憂慮曾與確診病人有高風險接觸，尤其是男男性接觸者或曾與陌生人發生性行為，可致電熱線查詢及獲取相關的健康建議。

立法會二十一題：治療及支援軟骨發育不全症患者,2025-10-15 18:48,2025-10-15 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500742.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上葛珮帆議員的提問和署理醫務衞生局局長范婉雯醫生的書面答覆︰

問題：

據悉軟骨發育不全症是一種既複雜又罕見的遺傳性骨骼疾病，影響患者的生長發育和多個系統功能。有專家指出，該疾病在香港的發病率大概為兩萬分之一，患者需要面對漫長而痛苦的治療過程，以及負擔龐大的醫療費用。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計公立醫院目前的軟骨發育不全症患者總數為何，並按年齡組別（即15歲以下、15歲至18歲以下，以及18歲或以上）列出分項數字；

（二）是否知悉，醫院管理局（醫管局）有否就軟骨發育不全症成立專家小組或撥出專項資源，以支援患者的長期治療過程；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）政府有否估算軟骨發育不全症患者的終生醫療成本為何，包括為其提供傳統的骨頭延長手術治療，以及有關的醫療跟進（包括住院、手術、術後護理、復康訓練等）；

（四）鑑於有病人組織指出，現時軟骨發育不全症患者（尤其成人患者）分散於不同公立醫院聯網，所獲跟進服務的水平不一，政府是否知悉，醫管局有否就該疾病制訂統一和全面治療指引；

（五）據悉近年推出了新的C型利鈉肽（CNP）藥物，軟骨發育不全症患者能透過皮下注射促進軟骨生長，該藥物也有助改善嚴重併發症對患者所帶來的影響，而多個地區已將有關藥物納入其國民保險或資助項目，政府會否參考有關經驗，研究將該藥物納入藥物名冊和安全網的資助範圍；

（六）政府會否考慮提高評估新藥物成本效益準則的透明度，以加快新藥物（尤其是治療罕見疾病藥物）納入安全網的程序；及

（七）政府會否參考國家近年推出的輔助性重大疾病醫療保險（例如「惠民保」），研究透過優化「自願醫保計劃」，或另設具「不限年齡、不限病史、全民可參與」特色的重大疾病保險產品，以鼓勵市民投保，從而紓緩醫療機構引入新藥以治療罕見疾病時的財政壓力？

答覆：

主席：

就葛珮帆議員的提問，經諮詢醫院管理局（醫管局）後，現綜合回覆如下：

政府和醫管局十分重視為所有病人（包括罕見病患者）提供適切的治療。

在應對罕見病方面，醫管局一直本着「全人醫治」的宗旨，透過跨專業及跨部門的醫療和康復團隊，以綜合服務模式為罕見病患者提供全人醫療和復康服務。相關的支援不單在於提供藥物治療，還包括多方位的服務，例如初生嬰兒篩查、臨床診斷和評估、手術、介入性治療、紓緩治療，以及復康服務等。

醫管局亦一直留意國際間對罕見病治療方案的臨床實證和科研發展，並不時與海外和內地的專家就共同關注的議題進行交流，以便互相借鑑經驗，促進服務發展。

（一）、（二）及（四）題述的軟骨發育不全症是一種罕見的遺傳性骨骼疾病，患者在兒童期常見骨科問題包括下肢對線不良，以及身材矮小等。除骨科問題外，患者亦可能出現睡眠窒息症、枕骨大孔狹窄、聽力受損及咬合不正等複雜問題。隨着患者進入成年期，亦可能會出現脊椎管狹窄、脊柱畸形及骨關節炎等骨科問題。根據醫管局紀錄，截至二○二五年六月三十日，軟骨發育不全症存活個案總人數為160人（註一）；年齡組別（註二）當中，0至14歲為30人，15至18歲為10人，19歲或以上為130人。

醫管局目前針對軟骨發育不全症的治療和支援方案，參考了國際學術團體於二○二一年發布的《軟骨發育不全症之診斷、跨專業管理及終身照護國際共識聲明》。該文件為醫療專業人員就患者所面對的多重醫療問題提供建議。

貫徹「全人醫治」的宗旨，並參考上述文件的相關建議，醫管局現時採取跨專科協作模式於專科門診為患者提供一站式服務，團隊成員包括骨科醫生、兒科醫生和相關專職醫療人員，涵蓋患者各階段的醫療、外科手術及心理照護等需要。針對出現下肢對線不良的兒童患者，醫管局會為其提供早期的手術治療。部分經嚴謹評估甄選為臨床合適的個案，亦會獲安排接受屬高複雜度程序的下肢延長手術，以減低病人因身材矮小對生活質素的影響。另外，如兒童患者出現睡眠窒息症、腦積水及枕骨大孔狹窄等危及生命的嚴重問題，亦會獲安排於具備相關專業知識的第三層專科轉介中心（如香港兒童醫院）接受相關的檢查和手術，並根據國際監察指引定期監察其臨床需要。隨着患者進入成年期，團隊內的專責護士會負責協調病人的各項檢查、治療和復康，並支援他們提升生活質素和自我管理疾病的能力，順利融入社區。

註一：數字調整至最接近的十位數。由於四捨五入，各項數字相加後未必等於總數。
註二：按病人截至二○二五年六月三十日的年齡計算。

（三）一般而言，軟骨發育不全症患者接受傳統骨延長手術後，亦會就該疾病到醫管局轄下的醫療機構就診，接受其他後續治療及醫療程序。然而，患者亦有機會同時因其他疾病而需到醫管局轄下機構求診並接受治療，因此難以確定有關患者每次就診是否與治療軟骨發育不全症有關。再者，鑑於每名患者的預期壽命、未來的就診情況及可能使用的服務類別均各有不同且難以預測，故此醫管局並沒有這類患者的終身醫療成本估算。

（五）及（六）藥物治療是為罕見病患者提供的醫療服務當中的一個重要部分。現時醫管局透過政府提供的經常撥款，以及安全網，例如關愛基金醫療援助項目，為罕見病患者提供藥物資助。

醫管局設有機制定期評估已獲註冊的新藥物，以及檢討醫管局藥物名冊（藥物名冊）內現有的藥物和安全網的資助範圍。檢討過程以實證為本，考慮藥物的安全性、療效、成本效益和其他相關因素，包括國際間的建議和做法，以及專業意見等，務求以公平有效的方式運用公共資源，讓病人得到適切的治療。因應醫療科技持續及迅速的發展步伐，以及大眾的期望不斷提升，醫管局自實施藥物名冊以來，一直持續完善藥物名冊的檢討機制，在檢討過程中加入更多持份者，以提高議決藥物名冊的涵蓋範圍過程的透明度。

為加快把合適的新藥物納入藥物名冊，醫管局自二○二四年年底起亦簡化藥物名冊引入新藥的申請程序，醫生和藥廠可以直接向藥物建議委員會呈交入藥申請。而把新藥納入安全網的優次順序編配工作，亦會由每年兩次增至每年四次。配合上述新機制實施，醫管局積極優化藥物名冊引入新藥的程序，目標將已獲實證有療效的新藥引入藥物名冊或安全網的資助範圍的所需時間減少一半，分別由原來的10個月減至五個月及由18個月縮短至九個月，讓病人可以盡快有新藥使用，亦可獲得安全網資助減輕藥費負擔。

同時，政府和醫管局亦將全力推動落實今年三月底公布的公營醫療收費改革方案，加強對「貧、急、重、危」病人的醫療保障。相關措施包括透過加快引入更多有效創新藥械到藥物名冊及安全網的資助適用範圍，以增加對危重病人的藥械保障，務求確保有限的醫療資源可精準投放幫助最有需要的病人，從而提升醫療系統的可持續性，發揮全民安全網的作用。

然而，鑑於治療罕見病的藥物價格可以十分高昂，其療效與其他替代藥物相比可能僅具邊緣效益，故此醫管局在考慮引入個別罕見病藥物時，除了透過臨床實證檢視藥物的療效及安全性，以及參考不同地區就相關罕見疾病的用藥指引、疾病管理和藥物補貼計劃的安排外，亦需兼顧藥物的成本效益及機會成本考慮，務求確保合理善用有限的公共醫療資源。

據了解，近年推出的C型利鈉肽（CNP）藥物為Vosoritide（Voxzogo），現為香港註冊藥物。據悉，該藥物在中國內地尚未註冊，因此應未正式納入中國內地的國民保險計劃或資助項目，部分海外地區如英國、新加坡等亦暫未將該藥物納入其國民保險或資助項目。

醫管局會繼續密切留意適用於治療軟骨發育不全症藥物的最新科研和臨床驗證，以確保病人可獲處方安全、有效和具成本效益的藥物，以及持續獲得適切的治療。

（七）據理解，內地各省市近年推出不同的商業補充醫療保險（例如「惠民保」），是建基於內地現行屬全民供款性質的基本醫療保險制度之上，自願性質的附加醫療保險。

香港未有推行類似內地的全民供款性質醫療保險制度。本港社會過去經廣泛公眾諮詢，並與醫療衞生界、保險業界和病人組織等持份者磋商後，政府自二○一九年四月起全面推行自願醫保計劃，目的是規範個人償款住院保險產品及增加市場透明度，讓本港市民更有信心購買醫療保險，以便他們在有需要時使用私營醫療服務。保險公司可設計不同自願醫保產品以配合市民所需，而相關產品均須符合在年齡、健康狀況／病史等方面保障消費者的要求，包括不論受保人士健康狀況有否改變，均須保證續保至一百歲，以及承保範圍須涵蓋未知的投保前已有病症。

同時，政府會繼續透過公營醫療服務，為所有香港市民提供醫療安全網，包括全方位加強對「貧、急、重、危」病人的醫療保障。事實上，大部分有昂貴及複雜醫療需要的人士均選擇於公營醫療系統接受治療。政府會繼續審慎研究如何善用公帑，以最具成本效益的方式，滿足相關人士的醫療需要。"
LCQ21: Treatment and support for achondroplasia patients,2025-10-15 18:48,2025-10-15 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500745.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Elizabeth Quat and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Health, Dr Cecilia Fan, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

It is learnt that achondroplasia is a complex and rare hereditary skeletal disorder that affects patients' growth and development, as well as multiple systemic functions. Some experts have pointed out that this disease has a prevalence of approximately 1 in 20 000 in Hong Kong, with patients having to face a long and painful treatment process alongside substantial medical expenses. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the total number of achondroplasia patients currently in public hospitals, with a breakdown by age group (aged below 15, 15 to below 18, and 18 or above);

(2) whether it knows if the Hospital Authority (HA) has established an expert group or allocated dedicated resources for achondroplasia to support patients' long-term treatment process; if HA has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) whether the Government has estimated the lifetime medical costs for achondroplasia patients, including the provision of conventional bone-lengthening surgery treatment and related medical follow-up, such as hospitalisation, surgery, post-operative care and rehabilitation training;

(4) as some patient groups have pointed out that achondroplasia patients (particularly adult patients) are currently scattered across different public hospital clusters and receive follow-up services of varying standards, whether the Government knows if HA has developed unified and comprehensive treatment guidelines for this disease;

(5) as it is learnt that a new C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) drug has been introduced in recent years which can promote cartilage growth in achondroplasia patients through subcutaneous injection and help mitigate the impact of severe complications on patients, and that several places have included this drug in their national insurance scheme or as a subsidised item, whether the Government will draw reference from the relevant experiences and study the inclusion of this drug in the Drug Formulary and the scope of the safety net subsidies;

(6) whether the Government will consider enhancing the transparency of the criteria for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new drugs to expedite the process of including new drugs (especially those for treating rare diseases) in the safety net; and

(7) whether the Government will draw reference from the supplementary medical insurance for major diseases launched by the country (such as People-Benefit Insurance) in recent years, and study improving the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme or establishing a separate insurance product for major diseases with the characteristics of ""no age limit, no medical history restrictions and universal participation"", so as to encourage members of the public to take out insurance policies, thereby alleviating the financial pressure on medical institutions when introducing new drugs to treat rare diseases?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Hospital Authority (HA), the consolidated reply to the question raised by Hon Elizabeth Quat is as follows:

The Government and the HA attach high importance to providing optimal care for all patients (including those with rare diseases).

In tackling rare diseases, the HA has been adhering to the principle of ""providing holistic care for patients"" in providing holistic medical and rehabilitation services to patients with rare diseases through a multi-disciplinary and inter-departmental medical and rehabilitation team in an integrated service model. The relevant support includes not only drug treatments, but also multi-faceted services such as newborn screening, clinical diagnosis and assessment, surgery, interventional therapies, palliative care and rehabilitation services.

The HA has also been keeping in view the international clinical evidence and scientific research development on treatment options for rare diseases, and conducting exchanges with overseas and Mainland experts from time to time on issues of common concern so as to learn from each other's experience and facilitate service development.

(1), (2) and (4) Achondroplasia as mentioned in the question is a rare hereditary skeletal disorder. Some of the common orthopaedic issues these patients encounter during childhood include lower limb malalignment and short stature. In addition to orthopaedic issues, patients may also develop other complex conditions such as sleep apnea, foramen magnum stenosis, hearing loss and malocclusion. As patients enter adulthood, they may also develop other orthopaedic conditions such as spinal stenosis, spinal deformity and osteoarthritis. According to the records of the HA, the total number of surviving cases of achondroplasia as of June 30, 2025 is 160 (Note 1). By age group (Note 2), 30 of these patients are aged 0 to 14, 10 are aged 15 to 18, and 130 are aged 19 or above.

The current treatment and support protocols of the HA for achondroplasia are based on the International Consensus Statement on the diagnosis, multidisciplinary management and lifelong care of individuals with achondroplasia published by international academic bodies in 2021. This document offers recommendations for healthcare professionals in addressing the multiple medical issues faced by patients.

Adhering to the principle of ""providing holistic care for patients"" and with reference to the relevant recommendations in the aforementioned document, the HA currently adopts a multi-disciplinary collaborative model in providing one-stop services for patients at Specialist Out-patient Clinics. A team comprising orthopaedic surgeons, paediatricians and relevant allied health professionals caters for patients' medical, surgical and psychosocial needs across various stages of life. For paediatric patients with lower limb malalignment, the HA may arrange early surgical intervention. Cases which have been rigorously assessed as clinically suitable may also be arranged to undergo lower limb lengthening surgery, which is a highly complex procedure, to mitigate the impact of short stature on their quality of life. Furthermore, if paediatric patients develop life-threatening complications such as sleep apnea, hydrocephalus or foramen magnum stenosis, they will be arranged to receive related assessments and surgical treatments at tertiary specialist referral centres with relevant expertise (such as the Hong Kong Children's Hospital). Their clinical needs will also be regularly monitored in accordance with international surveillance guidelines. As patients transition into adulthood, designated nurses within the team will co-ordinate their examinations, treatments and rehabilitation, while also providing support in terms of enhancing their quality of life and self-management skills, thereby facilitating their smooth integration into the community.

Note 1: The figures have been rounded to the nearest ten. Individual figures may not add up to the total due to rounding.
Note 2: Based on the patient's age as of June 30, 2025.

(3) Generally speaking, patients with achondroplasia who undergo conventional bone-lengthening surgery will also receive follow-up treatment and medical procedures for this condition at healthcare facilities under the HA. That being said, patients may also be required to attend HA facilities for treatment of other conditions, making it difficult to ascertain whether each attendance is attributable to the treatment of achondroplasia. Moreover, given each patient's life expectancy, future clinical attendance needs and categories of medical services required vary and are difficult to predict, the HA does not have an estimate for the lifetime medical costs for such patients.

(5) and (6) Drug treatment is an important part of the medical services provided to patients with rare diseases. Currently, the HA provides drug subsidies to patients with rare diseases through recurrent funding from the Government and the safety net, such as the Community Care Fund Medical Assistance Programmes.

The HA has put in place an established mechanism for regular evaluation of registered new drugs and review of the existing drugs listed in the HA Drug Formulary (HADF) and the coverage of the safety net. The review process is evidence-based, taking into account the safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness and other relevant considerations, including international recommendations and practices, as well as professional views, so as to ensure that public resources are utilised fairly and efficiently to enable patients to receive appropriate treatment. In view of the continuous rapid advancement in medical technology and the ever-increasing public expectations, the HA has, since the implementation of the HADF, continued to refine its review mechanism through incorporating additional stakeholders into the review process, thereby increasing the transparency of the decision-making process regarding the HADF's coverage.

To speed up the introduction of suitable new drugs to the HADF, the HA has simplified the application process for inclusion of new drugs in the HADF since the end of 2024. Clinicians and pharmaceutical companies can submit new drug applications directly to the Drug Advisory Committee. The frequency of prioritisation exercise for including new drugs in the safety net will also increase from twice a year to four times a year. With the implementation of the above new mechanisms, the HA has been actively optimising the procedures for introducing new drugs into the HADF, with the objective of reducing the time required for introducing new drugs with proven efficacy into the HADF or the coverage of the safety net by half, from the original 10 months to five months; and from 18 months to nine months respectively, so as to enable patients to have access to new drugs as soon as possible, and to obtain the subsidies under the safety net to alleviate the burden of drug expenses.

Meanwhile, the Government and the HA will also press ahead with the implementation of the fees and charges reform for public healthcare announced at the end of March this year, which aims to strengthen healthcare protection for ""poor, acute, serious, critical"" patients. Relevant measures include enhancing the protection in terms of drugs and medical devices for critically ill patients through accelerating the introduction of more effective innovative drugs and medical devices to the HADF and the coverage of the safety net, with a view to ensuring that the limited healthcare resources can be directed in a more targeted manner to assist those patients most in need. This will thereby improve the sustainability of the healthcare system and better serve as a safety net for all.

Nevertheless, drugs for the treatment of rare diseases can be very expensive and their efficacy may only be marginal when compared with other available treatment alternatives. Therefore, in considering the introduction of individual drugs for rare diseases, apart from reviewing the efficacy and safety of the drugs through clinical evidence and making reference to the guidelines on the use of the drugs for the relevant rare diseases in different regions, as well as the arrangements of the disease management and the drug reimbursement schemes thereat, the HA has to take into account the cost-effectiveness and opportunity cost considerations of the drugs, with a view to ensuring rational and effective use of the limited public healthcare resources.

It is understood that the C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) drug introduced in recent years is Vosoritide (Voxzogo), which is a registered drug in Hong Kong. It is noted that this drug has not yet been registered in the Chinese Mainland and therefore should not have been formally included in any national insurance scheme or subsidy programmes of the Chinese Mainland. Some overseas regions, such as the United Kingdom and Singapore, have also not yet included this drug in their national insurance or subsidy programmes.

The HA will continue to pay close attention to the latest scientific research and clinical evidence of drugs suitable for the treatment of achondroplasia, with a view to ensuring that patients are provided with cost-effective drugs of proven safety and efficacy as well as continuous optimal care.

(7) It is understood that different commercial supplementary medical insurance plans (such as Huiminbao) have been rolled out in various provinces and municipalities of the Mainland. They belong to voluntary additional medical insurance on top of the Mainland's prevailing basic medical insurance system premised on universal contribution.

A medical insurance system similar to the Mainland's one premised on universal contribution has not been implemented in Hong Kong. After extensive public consultations, as well as discussions with stakeholders such as the healthcare sector, insurance industry and patient groups, in Hong Kong, the Government has been fully implementing the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS) since April 2019 to establish standards and improve market transparency for individual indemnity hospital insurance products, providing Hong Kong citizens with greater confidence in using private healthcare services through purchasing medical insurance. Insurance companies can design different VHIS products to cater for citizens' needs, and such products must fulfill requirements on consumer protection in respect of age, health condition/medical history, etc. The requirements include guaranteed renewal up to the age of 100 regardless of any change in the health conditions of the insured persons, and covering unknown pre-existing conditions.

At the same time, the Government will continue to offer a medical safety net for all Hong Kong citizens through public healthcare services, including enhancing healthcare protection for ""poor, acute, serious, critical"" patients on all fronts. In fact, the majority of individuals with costly and complex medical needs would opt for receiving treatments in the public healthcare system. The Government will continue to prudently study how to make the best use of public funds to meet the medical needs of the individuals concerned in the most cost-effective manner."

  Customs officers intercepted a 47-year-old incoming female passenger and a 43-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on October 13.

尊敬的行政長官李家超、尊敬的孫尚武副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、霍震霆主席（中國香港體育協會暨奧林匹克委員會（港協暨奧委會）會長兼香港特別行政區（特區）代表團籌備委員會（籌委會）主席）、馮馬潔嫻主席（中國香港殘疾人奧委會會長兼籌委會主席）、各位嘉賓、各位運動員、各位傳媒朋友：

大家下午好。歡迎大家出席中華人民共和國第十五屆運動會（十五運會）香港特別行政區代表團授旗儀式。

四年一度的全國運動會（全運會），是我們國家級別最高、規模最大的綜合體育盛事。本屆賽事首次由廣東、香港和澳門三地共同承辦，標誌着深化粵港澳大灣區合作和融合的里程碑，當中亦包含國家對三地辦賽能力的肯定。大家參加或觀賞全運會，亦可以進一步厚植家國情懷，加深國民身分認同。

十五運會將於十一月九日正式開幕，香港會派出歷來規模最龐大的代表團參加，包括超過600位運動員及約270位隨隊工作人員和醫護人員，出戰28個競賽項目，而連同23個群眾賽事活動的參賽選手及工作人員，總參賽人數更超過1800人。

今次是香港自從回歸祖國以來第八次參加全運會。在上屆二○二一年陝西舉行的賽事當中，香港特區代表團共取得兩金五銅七面獎牌，成績令人鼓舞。近年來，中國香港運動員亦在多項國際大型賽事中屢創佳績，在去年舉行的巴黎奧運會更取得歷史性兩金兩銅成績，為香港的體育發展注入強勁動力。這些成績除了反映運動員的能力不斷提升外，亦證明特區政府培訓精英運動員的方向正確，同時展現特區政府與香港社會各界多年來攜手推動體育發展的成果。

特區政府一直投放大量資源支持體育發展。在二○二五至二六年度，我們對香港體育學院（體院）的撥款預算超過10億港元，用以支援體院培訓超過1 600名精英運動員，分別在22項「A級」及17項「B級」精英體育項目發展。除了提供實體訓練資源之外，為進一步完善對精英運動員的支援，體院在今年三月完成檢討精英運動員直接財政資助，其中重點包括將所有運動員的直接資助金額由今年四月一日開始上調百分之八點三，令運動員可以在更穩定的經濟環境下專注訓練。

特區政府一直循普及化、精英化、盛事化、專業化和產業化積極推動體育發展。今年三月正式啓用的啟德體育園，為香港提供世界級的體育設施，為本地體壇發展帶來新篇章，成效有目共睹。十五運會的擊劍、男子手球、七人制橄欖球，以及群眾項目保齡球賽事，都會在啟德體育園舉行，香港運動員將會在主場比賽。我深信各位運動員在我們大家熱情投入的歡呼聲中，一定能發揮最佳水平，與全國各省市精英同場較量，為榮譽、為夢想全力拼搏。

運動員要能專心訓練和比賽，離不開各方的鼎力支持。在此，我衷心感謝香港體育學院、港協暨奧委會、中國香港殘疾人奧委會、各個體育總會及體育機構、中文大學運動醫學團隊、中國香港運動禁藥管制機構，以及其他所有在幕後默默付出的朋友，你們是運動員最堅實的後盾。

同時，我也想藉此機會再次感謝香港賽馬會贊助四億五千萬港元，支持香港賽區籌備賽事。香港賽馬會亦透過賽馬會優秀運動員獎勵計劃，為得獎運動員頒發現金獎勵。為了進一步鼓勵香港特區代表隊運動員在今屆全運會全力以赴，爭取佳績，香港賽馬會會將獎勵計劃的原來預算上調百分之五十。即是個人項目的金牌獎金將增加至75萬港元；團體項目的金牌獎金將增加至150萬港元。在此感謝香港賽馬會對全運會和運動員的大力支持。

現在距離十五運會開幕僅餘25日，香港賽區的競賽項目即將展開，我們的準備工作亦到達衝刺階段。十五運會以「激情全運會，活力大灣區」為主題口號，相信各位運動員已經準備就緒，整裝待發，期待讓全國同胞見證香港健兒的拼搏精神，以及大灣區的澎湃活力。我們和全港市民將全力為你們加油。

在此，我預祝十五運會圓滿成功。香港運動員突破自我，勇創佳績，為港爭光。

多謝大家。"
The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong to commence services in phases from December 11 (with photo),2025-10-15 18:02,2025-10-15 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500325.htm,"  The Health Bureau (HHB) and the Operator of The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong (CMHHK) announced today (October 15) that CMHHK will commence services in phases starting from December 11. In the first year after the service commencement, CMHHK will provide outpatient and day-patient services and fully launch six specialised Chinese medicine (CM) services, along with 12 special disease programmes.

  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""CMHHK is the first CM service-predominant hospital in Hong Kong. As a highly anticipated CM flagship project, the hospital will help furtherpromote the high-quality and high-standard development of CM in Hong Kong on all fronts. Upon its service commencement, CMHHK will lead the way for Hong Kong's CM services to go beyond primary healthcare and play a part in secondary and tertiary healthcare services, bringing significant breakthroughs in the development of CM in Hong Kong. I am very excited that the hospital is about to commence its service, and look forward to its development of a 'Hong Kong model' for pure CM services, services with CM playing the predominant role and integrated Chinese-Western medicine (ICWM) services, providing more comprehensive CM services to members of the public.

  ""Meanwhile, as a flagship CM institution in Hong Kong, CMHHK will undertake five key missions of development. Apart from providing healthcare services to members of the public, its missions include training and education, research, collaboration and creating health values. CMHHK will give full play to its role as a 'change driver' to drive CM development in Hong Kong and in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area through close collaboration with the CM sector and stakeholders, as well as to assist CM services to go global, thereby contributing to the national development of CM.""

  CMHHK is a hospital controlled by the Health Bureau and not a public hospital managed by the Hospital Authority under the Hospital Authority Ordinance (Chapter 113). The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong Ordinance (Chapter 655), which took effect in May this year, ensures the smooth daily operation of the hospital. CMHHK will also collaborate with public and private healthcare institutions to provide quality CM services for members of the public.

Clinical services of CMHHK

  In the first year, CMHHK will provide outpatient and day-patient services and fully launch six specialised CM services, namely Internal Medicine in CM, External Medicine in CM, Gynaecology in CM, Paediatrics in CM, Orthopaedics and Traumatology in CM, and Acupuncture and Moxibustion in CM. It will also provide 12 special disease programmes including those for elderly degenerative diseases and stroke rehabilitation.

  For outpatient services, government-subsidised services cover General Clinic, Specialised Clinic and Integrated Allied Health Clinic services, while market-oriented services cover Private Clinic and Integrated Allied Health Clinic services.

  Day-patient services also cover both government-subsidised services and market-oriented services. Twenty-five beds will be provided in the first year, primarily for CM cases requiring longer treatment time or more complicated procedures, providing patients with one-stop comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment.

  Inpatient services will mainly commence from the second year, with other services expanding year by year, including the remaining 11 special disease programmes. It is expected that by the end of 2030, CMHHK will provide full inpatient services with 400 patient beds, as well as outpatient services of 400 000 annual attendance.

  CMHHK'sgovernment-subsidised services, which are accessible to eligible Hong Kong citizens, will account for 65 per cent of the hospital's total service volume, demonstrating the Government's commitment to public health. The hospital will also provide market-oriented services to foster positive interaction with the private market.

Service highlights

  The services of CMHHK will feature the following highlights:

(i) Specialised CM services and special disease progarmmes: Adhering to the principle of ""Pursuing speciality in specialised CM services and exceling in special disease programmes"", the hospital will pool talent, experience, knowledge and techniques to focus on the development of key areas where CM has distinct advantages, offering effective treatment outcomesfor members of the public.

(ii)CM playing the predominant role and ICWM:The hospital is committed topreserving and inheritingCM theory and practice, while also developingevidence-based innovativetreatment plans for pure CM services and services with CM playing the predominant role. The hospital will also actively develop an ICWM service model,combining the strengths of both Chinese and Western medicinesto formulate treatment plans, supplemented by multidisciplinary healthcare teams, thereby providingcomprehensive and optimalclinical support for patients.

(iii)Galaxy of talent: The hospital willbring together an elite teamof Hong Kong, the Mainland, and international CM expert teams across multiple disciplines at the hospital to participate in short-term services, training, and research,leveraging their outstanding capabilitiesto drive the hospital's development.

(iv) Personalised services: The hospital will uphold the traditional CM philosophy of ""treatment based on pattern differentiation"". Through providing wholehearted services together with professional andprecise analysis, the hospital will tailor-make personalised careservices for patients to resolve their problems.

Fee arrangements

  CMHHK will take on the role of a ""change driver"", driving the development of the CM market with a primary focus on ""develop and transfer"". CMHHK has fully considered factors such as market prices, public affordability and service costs when formulating its service fee models, with a view to ensuring members of the public can access the services at reasonable and affordable prices.

  The hospital adopts fee models including package charges, simplified itemised charges and combined charges to enhance fee transparency, enabling members of the public to easily understand the fee arrangements and manage their healthcare expenses. This approach also encourages members of the public to select services according to their actual needs and make optimal use of resources. A medical fee waiver mechanism will be in place in CMHHK. Specified patient groups will be eligible for a full fee waiver. Other patients facing financial hardship and cannot afford the medical expenses may also apply to the hospital for fee waiver.

  To encourage citizens in need to experience the services of the first CM hospital in Hong Kong, CMHHK will offer a special experience discount in its first year of operation. Selected designated services will be offered at a promotional rate of 10 per cent to 30 per cent off the original price.

  Fees for subsidised services and market-oriented services are listed at Annex 1 and Annex 2.

Information and appointment booking

  CMHHK has launched its new website (www.cmhhk.org.hk). Members of the public can make appointments via the website or the hotline (3121 3121) from November 1 onwards. Moreover, members of the public can make appointments through the hospital mobile application to be launched on December 1. In-person appointments can be made at CMHHK from December 11 onwards. In addition, members of the public are welcome to join the open day activities organised by the hospital with details to be announced in due course.

  Located at 1 Pak Shing Kok Road in Tseung Kwan O, CMHHK adopts a public-private partnership model with its construction fully funded by the Government. Hong Kong Baptist University was selected as the Contractor through tendering procedures in 2021 and it subsequently incorporated a company as the Operator responsible for the overall services of the hospital, including its management, operation, and maintenance, according to a service deed. Funding arrangements for subsidised services, education and training, and research, as well as the overall fee setting, are all executed in accordance with the service deed signed among the Government, the Contractor and the Operator."

醫衞局局長盧寵茂教授表示：「香港中醫醫院是香港首間以中醫服務為主的醫院，是萬眾期待的中醫藥旗艦項目，將有助進一步推動本港中醫藥的高質量、高水平及全方位發展。醫院開院後可帶領香港中醫藥服務由基層醫療邁進第二和第三層醫療服務，為香港中醫藥發展帶來重大突破。我對醫院即將投入服務感到非常振奮，並期望醫院進一步建立純中醫、中醫為主及中西醫協作臨床服務的『香港模式』，為市民提供更全面的中醫藥服務。」

「與此同時，作為本地中醫藥旗艦機構，香港中醫醫院肩負五大發展任務，除了為市民提供醫療服務外，亦包括教學和培訓、科研、多方協作及創造健康價值，並積極發揮『轉化者』角色，與中醫藥業界和持份者緊密合作，推動中醫藥在本地、粵港澳大灣區的發展，並助力中醫藥服務走向世界，為國家中醫藥發展作出貢獻。」

香港中醫醫院是一所由醫衞局監管的醫院，並非《醫院管理局條例》（第113章）下由醫院管理局管理的公營醫院。今年五月生效的《香港中醫醫院條例》（第655章）確保醫院日常運作暢順。該院亦會與公營和私營醫療機構合作，為市民提供優質的中醫藥服務。

醫院臨床服務

醫院首年會提供門診及日間住院服務，並全面開展中醫六大分科服務，即中醫內科、中醫外科、中醫婦科、中醫兒科、中醫骨傷科及中醫針灸科，以及老年退化性疾病和中風後復康等12個專病項目。

在門診服務方面，政府資助的服務涵蓋全科門診、分科門診及綜合專職醫療門診。而市場導向的門診服務設有私家門診及綜合專職醫療門診。

醫院日間住院服務亦同時涵蓋政府資助及市場導向兩類服務，首年共設有25張病床，主要處理需時較長或程序較複雜的中醫個案，為病人提供一站式多專業的全面治療。

住院服務主要由第二年開展，其餘服務亦會逐年擴展，包括陸續推出餘下的11個專病項目，預計二○三○年年底會啓用400張病床，提供全面住院服務，並提供每年40萬人次的門診服務。

香港中醫醫院整體服務量的百分之六十五為政府資助服務，體現政府對市民醫療的承擔，合資格的香港市民均可選擇使用。醫院亦會提供市場導向服務，有助促進醫院與私營市場的正面互動。

服務亮點

香港中醫醫院服務將涵蓋以下亮點：

（一）分科專病：秉持「分科做專、專病做強」的原則，集中人才、經驗、知識、技術，重點發展中醫藥不同優勢領域，為市民帶來顯著治療果效。

（二）中醫為主、中西醫協作：以傳承中醫理論與經驗，再以實證為本創新發展純中醫和中醫為主的治療方案；另外會積極發展中西醫協作服務模式，集中西醫學所長，結合於治療方案，輔以跨專業醫療團隊提供全面及最佳的臨床支援。

（三）精英薈萃：匯聚本港、內地和國際來自不同範疇的中醫藥精英隊伍到院參與短期的服務、培訓及科研工作，以卓越的能力助力醫院發展。

（四）個人化服務：醫院團隊秉持傳統中醫個體化的「辨證論治」理念，透過「從心出發」的服務和專業精準分析，為病人度身訂造個人化服務，解決健康問題。

收費安排

香港中醫醫院肩負起「轉化者」的角色，以「發展—轉移」為核心，帶動中醫藥市場發展。在制定服務收費模式時，醫院已充分考慮市場價格、市民的承擔能力以及服務成本等因素，確保市民可以合理及可負擔的價格享用服務。

醫院採用「套餐收費」、「簡易分項收費」及「組合式收費」的收費模式，提升收費透明度，讓市民容易明白收費安排和掌握醫療開支預算，並鼓勵市民按實際需要選擇服務，善用資源。醫院設有醫療費用減免機制，指定病人組別可獲全額費用減免。至於其他有經濟困難而未能負擔醫療服務費用的病人，也可向醫院申請費用減免。

為鼓勵有需要的市民親身體驗香港首間中醫醫院的服務，香港中醫醫院特別在開院首年推出體驗優惠，部分指定服務將以原價七折至九折提供。

有關資助服務及市場導向服務的收費見附件一及附件二。

資訊與預約

香港中醫醫院的全新網站（www.cmhhk.org.hk）已經推出，由十一月一日起，市民可透過網站或熱線電話（3121 3121）預約服務。此外，醫院的流動應用程式亦將於十二月一日推出，屆時市民可經流動應用程式預約服務，或於十二月十一日起親臨醫院預約登記。另外，醫院亦會舉行開放日，歡迎市民參與，詳情將適時公布。

香港中醫醫院位於將軍澳百勝角路一號，由政府全資興建，以公私營協作模式營運。香港浸會大學於二○二一年透過招標程序獲委任為承辦機構，並根據服務契約的要求成立營運機構，負責醫院的整體服務，包括該院的管理、營運及保養。資助服務、教學培訓及科研項目的撥款安排，以及整體服務收費的釐定，均按照政府與承辦機構及營運機構簽訂的服務契約執行。"

尊敬的梁錦松主席（惜食堂主席）、胡家驃先生（香港賽馬會董事）、董愛麗女士（惜食堂創辦人）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今日我懷着很高興甚至興奮及敬佩的心情出席惜食堂賽馬會食品製作中心的開幕典禮。

處理廚餘一直是香港廢物管理的一個大問題。每天棄置於堆填區的都市固體廢物中，約三成是廚餘。為配合香港二○五○年前實現碳中和的目標，特區政府一直大力推動全民惜食和廚餘回收。

環保署積極推行各項廚餘回收措施，協助工商業和市民收集廚餘。今年《施政報告》亦宣布，政府會繼續完善廚餘回收網絡，並推進實踐公共屋邨「一座一桶」智能廚餘回收桶的目標。回收到的廚餘會運往廚餘處理設施轉化為電力和堆肥，實現資源循環再用。

解決廚餘問題，除了政府推動政策外，亦有賴企業、市民和社會各界的積極參與，同心協力實踐源頭減廢。在這方面，惜食堂樹立了十分良好的榜樣，可說是典範。自二○一一年成立以來，惜食堂一直致力回收仍可食用的剩餘食物，將其加工重新製作成膳食，再免費分發給社會上有需要的人士。在協助在源頭減少廚餘之餘，這是一件切切實實的社會功德。我在此感謝惜食堂多年來在支援弱勢社群和解決廚餘問題的重要貢獻。剛才主席也指出，這不是送食物給人，而是愛心，令到一些有需要的人士，當中包括一些上年紀的人士感到人間有愛，這是非常之重要。

我很高興見證惜食堂透過支援非政府機構善用空置政府用地的資助計劃，建成了新的食品製作中心，可以在5年內最高每日供應5萬份營養均衡的膳食，提升服務規模，讓社會上更多人受惠。

最後，我祝惜食堂的發展更上一層樓，亦希望各位繼續與政府攜手推動「惜食、減廢」文化，共同推動香港的可持續發展。多謝大家。​"

President,

As an important engine for the future development of Hong Kong and the transformation of industries, as well as a new platform for coordinated development with other cities in the Greater Bay Area, the Northern Metropolis (NM) will enhance Hong Kong's role as the key node connecting the Mainland with the world. Given the sheer size of the NM and the magnitude of the investment required, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region adopts innovative and diverse development approaches to leverage the resources from the Government and the market to take forward the project.

Having consulted the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau (ITIB), my reply to various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) Under the large-scale land disposal approach, the successful bidder will comprehensively develop sizable land parcels including residential and industrial sites with commercial value, as well as public facility sites. The Government has proposed three pilot areas which are located in Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen New Development Area (HSK), Fanling North New Development Area and San Tin Technopole respectively. 22 submissions were received under the expression of interest exercise earlier, providing us with market views before we finalise the tender terms.

We plan to start with the tendering of the HSK pilot area by end of this year. Tenders for the remaining two pilot areas will be put up progressively next year. We are now adjusting the relevant arrangements and requirements for the HSK pilot area in response to the market views, including increasing the number of private residential sites from two to three and taking out the requirement for bidders to construct a major road, so as to reduce the requirements for constructing public facilities and increase the project's financial viability. There are three Enterprises and Technology Park sites within the pilot area. Originally, we required the successful tenderer to develop and operate one of them, while the remaining two should be returned to the Government after the sites are formed. We are now considering providing an option in the tender, so that tenderers who are willing to participate in developing more industrial sites within the pilot area will be given more marks for such additional undertaking under the two-envelope approach. Besides, we are considering allowing a longer building covenant and a more flexible land premium payment arrangement, including payment by instalments. We will announce the final arrangements when we launch the tender at the end of this year.

(2) We will employ flexible land grant arrangements in the NM, encouraging enterprises to set up businesses and invest in the area. If a tendering approach is adopted, depending on the circumstances, we may consider the premium offer only, or to adopt a two-envelope approach in the tendering. The Sandy Ridge Data Facility Cluster site recently put up by the ITIB has adopted the two-envelope approach, and we are inclined to adopt this approach for the HSK pilot area as well. The adoption of a two-envelope approach in the tendering will consider the non-premium and premium proposals comprehensively, with the weightings and elements for assessment set to suit the individual circumstances. Taking the tendering of Sandy Ridge as an example, the weightings of non-premium and premium proposals are 70 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. The non-premium proposal will assess the bidders' contribution to Hong Kong in terms of investment and development of industries, such as the number of persons employed, the investment scale and the period for commencement of operation. To ensure that the tendering work is open and transparent, the assessment criteria will be set out in the tender documents, so that bidders may thoroughly understand the project requirements and the marking scheme. The Government will set up a tender assessment panel comprising relevant bureaux and departments for assessing the tenders objectively and professionally in accordance with the Stores and Procurement Regulations. The assessment result will be submitted to the Central Tender Board under the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau for approval.

(3) The construction of the first three buildings in Phase 1 of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone (the Hong Kong Park) has been completed. The Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park Limited (HSITPL) is pressing ahead with the relevant leasing work. Currently, in-depth discussion with around 30 enterprises, universities and research organisations from the Mainland, Hong Kong, and around the world regarding their plans to set foot in the Hong Kong Park has been carried out. Among which, a significant portion has signed tenancy agreements. The first batch of tenants covering pillar industries such as life and health technology, microelectronics, new energy, and AI are expected to enter into operation officially before the end of this year. As the leasing work of the HSITPL is in progress, the number of enterprises and organisations signing tenancy agreements will increase gradually.

The HSITPL will provide supporting facilities, such as talent accommodation, commercial and other ancillary facilities to support the operation of enterprises and organisations in the Hong Kong Park. Meanwhile, the HSITPL is actively preparing the launch of ""Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park Incubation Support Programme"" within 2025-26, to provide funding and support services to start-up teams and enterprises so as to fully realise the notion of attracting talent with industries. Besides, the Government is exploring, under the dedicated legislation for the NM being prepared, facilitating measures for cross-boundary flow of personnel, data and materials, etc for designated areas. Also, the Financial Secretary will lead the relevant policy bureaux in formulating packages of preferential policies covering land grants, land premiums, financial subsidies or tax incentives. These strategic measures will help attract research and high-end manufacturing industries to establish a presence in Hong Kong including the Hong Kong Park.  "

十月份第二批涵蓋六個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及兩個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十月共兩批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共14個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年九月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這14個監察區中，九個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有五區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Among the second batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering six survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering two survey areas in October, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released two batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in October 2025, covering 14 survey areas. Among these 14 survey areas, nine recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. September 2025, representing that the areas’ mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Five other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

問題：

為支援香港展覽業，特區政府透過「定期展覽獎勵計劃」、「定期展覽獎勵計劃2.0」和「中小企業市場推廣基金」（「市場推廣基金」）等資助計劃向主辦商和參展商提供資助。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（四）除了上述資助計劃，政府有否其他政策措施支援展覽業，以維持業界的競爭力及進一步鼓勵投資；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

會議及展覽（會展）業是香港作為國際貿易中心的重要一環，香港特別行政區（特區）政府一直透過不同措施，推動會展業的長遠發展。

特區政府於二○二三年七月首次推出「定期展覽獎勵計劃」（計劃），提供場租獎勵，吸引不同規模的本地和國際展覽持續在港舉行，每場展覽的獎勵上限為2,000萬元。計劃已於二○二五年六月三十日結束，反應非常理想，共支援約220場合資格展覽，涉及的總金額超過12億元。我們就計劃發布的申請指引清楚訂明合資格展覽的要求，所有申請均符合申請資格。計劃所支援的展覽吸引了眾多參加者（包括參展商和買家），不單令會展業界受惠，展覽帶來高消費商務旅客，帶動住宿、餐飲、零售、娛樂等其他行業的經濟活動，令多個行業受益。

為進一步推動會展業和盛事經濟的發展，從而為香港創造整體經濟效益，特區政府於二○二四年《施政報告》宣布再撥款五億元於今年七月一日推出「定期展覽獎勵計劃2.0」（計劃2.0），聚焦支持新設及定期的大型國際性展覽在場租方面的支出，為香港會展業注入新活力。經總結業界的意見和原計劃的運作經驗後，新計劃加入一些新安排，包括：

（一）只涵蓋非本地參加者（包括參展商和買家）數目達1 500人的國際展覽；
（二）每個合資格展覽可獲的場租獎勵金額上限為1,000萬元；及
（三）除香港會議展覽中心（會展中心）和亞洲國際博覽館（亞博館）外，新增中環海濱活動空間和西九文化區的相關部分為指定場地。

上述安排旨在聚焦國際性活動，惠及更多合資格展覽，以及為主辦單位提供更多場地選擇。

根據申請指引，主辦單位可於合資格展覽完成後的兩個月內提交申請。由於計劃2.0仍在起步階段，我們暫時只收到和處理了大約10個申請，涉及的總金額約為4,000萬元。如申請指引所述及我們過去向業界於不同場合解釋，計劃2.0會於款項用畢後結束，我們會視乎款項的實際運用情況，適時公布計劃2.0的結束日期。就此，我們會與有關場地營辦商和業界保持緊密溝通。

此外，特區政府透過「中小企業市場推廣基金」（「市場推廣基金」）提供資助，鼓勵香港中小企業參與出口推廣活動，拓展境外市場。為支援企業於疫情期間和疫後復蘇時期進行更多推廣，「市場推廣基金」自二○二一年四月底推行特別措施，擴大資助範圍，涵蓋以本地市場為目標的展覽會和網上展覽會，同時放寬只限中小企業申請的要求。有關特別措施已延長至二○二六年六月底。

由二○二一年五月至二○二五年九月底，「市場推廣基金」共接獲約42 150宗涉及本地市場為目標的展覽會及網上展覽會的申請，當中共約30 700宗已完成處理並批出資助。「市場推廣基金」的資助對象為推廣其產品／服務的企業，因此工業貿易署只就申請企業及其參展內容收集資料，而未有備存問題所述的其他展覽會數據。

特區政府於二○二五年三月宣布在「市場推廣基金」及「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」（「BUD專項基金」）下推出措施，以更聚焦和可持續方式為中小企業提供支援。目前，「市場推廣基金」的資助比例已由核准開支總費用的1（政府）：1（企業）調整至1：3。每宗申請10萬元的資助上限則維持不變。

由於現時的營商環境充滿不明朗因素及挑戰，企業更須升級轉型，以及在傳統市場以外作多元化發展以維持競爭力。傳統的商業模式（如單純刊登產品資料或純宣傳推廣）或已有所不足。為聚焦有限資源以裝備企業升級轉型，「市場推廣基金」將於二○二六年六月三十日後，整合至「BUD專項基金」。由二○二六年七月一日起，申請企業可在升級轉型的前提下，就出口推廣和宣傳活動申請「BUD專項基金」。為協助企業適應整合安排，二○二五年《施政報告》亦宣布我們會加強宣傳和協助企業透過「BUD專項基金」——「申請易」參與展覽會和出口推廣活動，以拓展更多元化的市場。

現時，大部分企業尚未用罄「BUD專項基金」下的700萬元的累計資助上限，故我們相信整合後企業仍可靈活運用「BUD專項基金」，推行市場推廣活動。

為長遠鞏固香港作為國際會展業樞紐的地位，除了上述的獎勵及資助計劃，特區政府會繼續擴建會展設施。香港機場管理局已開展亞博館的擴建工程，項目預計在二○二八年落成。同時，特區政府繼續按計劃推進會展中心附近的灣仔北重建項目，包括將灣仔北三座政府大樓、告士打道花園及港灣消防局用地重建為會展設施、酒店等。亞博館第二期擴建計劃和灣仔北重建項目預計合共提供額外63 750平方米的可租用會展面積。特區政府在推展這兩項計劃的同時，會致力靈活運用現有場地和設施，以滿足市場需求。"

Question:

 âTo support the exhibition industry in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government provides funding to organisers and exhibitors through schemes such as the Incentive Scheme for Recurrent Exhibitions (ISRE), the ISRE 2.0 and the SME Export Marketing Fund (EMF). In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following information (i) since the launch of the ISRE, and (ii) since the introduction of special measures under the EMF on April 30, 2021: the respective numbers of applications received and approved, together with the names of the organisers of the subsidised eligible exhibitions, their exhibition content, dates, venues, amounts of funding received, numbers and proportions of local and overseas exhibitors, numbers and proportions of local and overseas visitors and the regions of origin of overseas exhibitors and visitors (set out in a table);

(2) as some members of the industry have relayed that the ISRE 2.0 launched by the Government on July 1 this year does not have a specified end date, which affects the industry's cost budgeting for organising exhibitions, when the Government will announce the end date of the ISRE 2.0, and whether it will optimise the ISRE 2.0 by, for example, adjusting the quota for non-local participants and relaxing requirements such as the gross floor area used for demonstrating or displaying products, materials and services; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) given that the EMF will be consolidated into the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales after June 30, 2026, with adjustments to the funding ceiling, matching ratio, etc, whether the Government has assessed the impact of these adjustments on the industry (e.g. the number of applications and the scale of activities); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) apart from the aforementioned funding schemes, whether the Government has other policy measures to support the exhibition industry, with a view to maintaining its competitiveness and encouraging further investment; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 âThe convention and exhibition (C&E) industry is crucial to Hong Kong as an international trade centre. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been promoting the long-term development of the C&E industry through various measures.

 âThe HKSAR Government first launched the Incentive Scheme for Recurrent Exhibitions (ISRE) in July 2023, providing venue rental incentives to attract local and international exhibitions of different scales to be staged recurrently in Hong Kong. The maximum incentive for each exhibition was capped at $20 million. The ISRE ended on June 30, 2025, and was very well received, supporting around 220 eligible exhibitions with the total incentive amount exceeding $1.2 billion. The requirements for eligible exhibitions were clearly set out in the Application Guide promulgated by us, and all applications met the eligibility criteria. The exhibitions supported by the ISRE attracted numerous participants (including exhibitors and buyers), not only benefitting the C&E industry but also bringing in high-spending business travellers that drive economic activities in such related sectors as accommodation, catering, retail, entertainment, etc, thereby benefitting various industries.

 âTo further promote the development of the C&E industry and the mega event economy, thereby generating overall economic benefits for Hong Kong, the HKSAR Government announced in the 2024 Policy Address the allocation of an additional funding of $500 million for launching the ISRE 2.0 on July 1 this year. The ISRE 2.0 focuses on supporting the venue rental expenses for new and recurrent international exhibitions of a large scale with a view to boosting the vibrancy of the C&E industry in Hong Kong. Taking into account the industry's views and the operational experience of the original ISRE, a number of new features have been introduced under the new scheme, including:

(a) only international exhibitions attracting at least 1 500 non-local participants (including exhibitors and buyers) will be covered;
(b) the maximum venue rental incentive for each eligible exhibition is capped at $10 million; and
(c) the Central Harbourfront Event Space and relevant parts of the West Kowloon Cultural District are included as new specified venues, alongside the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) and AsiaWorld-Expo (AWE).

 âThe above arrangements aim to focus on international events, benefit more eligible exhibitions and offer more venue options to the organisers.

 âAccording to the Application Guide, organisers may submit applications within two months after completion of the eligible exhibitions. As the ISRE 2.0 is still in the inception stage, we have received and processed about 10 applications so far, involving a total incentive amount of around $40 million. As stipulated in the Application Guide and explained to the industry on various occasions earlier on, the ISRE 2.0 will end upon exhaustion of the funds. Subject to the actual utilisation of the funds, we will announce the end date of the ISRE 2.0 in good time. We will maintain close liaison with the relevant venue operators and the industry in this regard.

 âIn addition, the HKSAR Government provides funding support through the SME Export Marketing Fund (EMF) to encourage Hong Kong small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to participate in export marketing activities and tap into non-local markets. To support enterprises to conduct more promotion during the pandemic and the post-pandemic recovery periods, special measures have been implemented under the EMF since end-April 2021 to expand the funding scope to cover exhibitions targeting the local market and online exhibitions, as well as relaxing the eligibility criteria to cover non-SMEs. Relevant special measures have been extended to end-June 2026.

 âFrom May 2021 to end-September 2025, around 42 150 applications involving exhibitions targeting the local market and online exhibitions have been received under the EMF, among which around 30 700 applications have been processed and approved. As the EMF targets at enterprises promoting their products/services, the Trade and Industry Department only collects information about applicant enterprises and their participation in exhibitions, but does not maintain other exhibition-related statistics mentioned in the question.

 âIn March 2025, the HKSAR Government announced the implementation of various measures under the EMF and the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales (BUD Fund) with a view to providing support to SMEs in a more focused and sustainable manner. Currently, the matching ratio of the EMF has been adjusted from 1 (Government): 1 (enterprise) to 1:3 of the total approved expenditure. There is no change to the funding ceiling per application of $100,000.

 âAs the current business environment is rife with uncertainties and challenges, it is imperative for enterprises to upgrade and diversify away from traditional markets to remain competitive. Traditional modes of business (such as mere product listing or publicity) may not suffice. To focus our limited resources to equip enterprises for upgrading and transformation, the EMF will be consolidated into the BUD Fund after June 30, 2026. Starting from July 1, 2026, enterprises may, in the context of upgrading and transformation, apply for the BUD Fund to participate in exporting marketing and promotional activities. To assist enterprises in adapting to the arrangements of the consolidation, it has been announced in the 2025 Policy Address that we will enhance promotion and facilitate the participation of companies in exhibitions and export promotion activities through ""Easy BUD"" under the BUD Fund, thereby developing more diversified markets.

 âCurrently, most enterprises have not yet fully utilised the $7 million cumulative funding ceiling under the BUD Fund. We believe that enterprises can still flexibly utilise the BUD Fund after the consolidation to implement marketing activities.

 âTo consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international C&E hub in the long run, apart from the abovementioned incentive and subsidy schemes, the HKSAR Government will continue to take forward the expansion projects of C&E facilities. The Airport Authority Hong Kong has commenced the construction works for the AWE expansion, which is expected to be completed in 2028. Meanwhile, the HKSAR Government continues to take forward the Wan Chai North Redevelopment project near the HKCEC as planned, including the redevelopment of the sites of the Wan Chai Government Offices Compound, Gloucester Road Garden and Kong Wan Fire Station into C&E facilities, hotel, etc. The AWE Phase 2 expansion project and the Wan Chai North Redevelopment project are expected to provide an additional 63 750 square metres of rentable C&E space. While implementing these two projects, the HKSAR Government will strive to flexibly utilise the existing venues and facilities for meeting the market demand."
LCQ3: Mobile applications launched by government departments,2025-10-15 16:30,2025-10-15 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500409.htm,"  âFollowing is a question by the Hon Lee Chun-keung and a reply by the Secretary for Innovation, Industry and Industry Bureau, Professor Sun Dong, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

  There are views that the functions of mobile applications launched by the Government are fragmented, and that members of the public often need to download multiple applications to access various government information and services, which in effect results in a waste of time and public money. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the 10 government mobile applications with the lowest number of downloads in each of the past five years and their respective download figures; whether the numbers of downloads of these applications have met the targets set at the time of their launch;

(2) of the 10 government departments that have provided the largest number of mobile applications for public download in each of the past five years, and set out the key functions of these applications and their respective annual maintenance costs; and


(3) as the Government has indicated that it aims to migrate all services provided by various government mobile applications into the ""iAM Smart"" mini-program platform by the end of this year to achieve a ""single portal for e-government services"", and reduce the number of government applications by half within the coming two years, of the specific details and progress of such exercises, including whether it will integrate the newly launched ""Electronic Driving Licence"" mobile application from the Transport Department into ""iAM Smart"" to reduce maintenance costs?

Replyï¼

President,

  In respect of the question raised by the Hon Lee Chun-keung, having consolidated the information provided by relevant bureaux/departments (B/Ds), my reply is as follows:

  Mobile applications (apps) are one of the approaches for the Government to implement e-Government services, with ""bringing convenience and benefits to the public"" being our guiding principle. B/Ds develop various mobile apps according to their business need for the public to download and use. Currently, there are 75 mobile apps being maintained by 34 B/Ds, covering different policy areas. Regarding questions (1) and (2) on the Government mobile apps with the lowest numbers of download and the B/Ds providing the highest numbers of mobile apps, the relevant information is set out at Annex 1 and Annex 2 respectively.

  The Digital Policy Office (DPO) has published the ""Practice Guide for Developing Mobile Apps"" for the development and implementation of government mobile apps. It is stipulated that B/Ds are required to set out the objectives and usage of the app before development and to conduct regular review after the apps are launched to ensure that the apps are updated, optimised, or integrated with existing apps in a cost-effective manner. In evaluating the effectiveness, apart from the numbers of download, B/Ds also comprehensively consider factors including the target user groups (e.g. whether the apps are designed specifically for people with special needs), user feedback and the changing demands. Over the past five years, B/Ds have decommissioned or consolidated around 40 mobile apps into other platforms.

  At the same time, to strengthen the co-ordination of digital government services launched by various B/Ds, the DPO issued a circular early this year requiring B/Ds to prioritise the use of ""iAM Smart"" as the primary platform for delivering their new mobile apps or online services. B/Ds shall not develop new standalone mobile apps which are separated from the ""iAM Smart"" platform unless there are sufficient justifications and approvals from the Heads of B/Ds and the DPO.

  In fact, one of the policy goals of the digital government is to facilitate the public to access government information and services in a one-stop manner, enabling handling of e-Government services on a single portal through the centralised ""iAM Smart"" platform. The DPO is introducing a ""Mini-program Platform"" in ""iAM Smart"" this year, marking an important step toward an integrated digital government. Citizens will be able to directly access and use e-services provided by various B/Ds with the mini-programs in ""iAM Smart"", without the need to download the mobile apps provided by individual B/Ds. If B/Ds need to retain or launch individual mobile apps due to policy, user experience or operational considerations (particularly for apps with numerous or complex functions), they can also leverage ""iAM Smart"" by migrating some frequently used functions to the ""Mini-program Platform"" to significantly enhance the convenience of accessing e-Government services for the public.

  The ""Mini-program Platform"" of ""iAM Smart"" will be launched in December this year. We anticipate that about 20 or more of the existing government mobile apps can be gradually migrated to the ""Mini-program Platform"" within two years, while around 20 mobile apps will be phased out, substantially reducing the total number of government mobile apps. As for the remaining roughly 30 apps (including the Transport Department’s ""Electronic Driving Licence""), the DPO will continue to work with the relevant B/Ds to review their implementation, ensuring that government mobile apps fulfill their original purpose of ""bringing convenience and benefits to the public""."

（二）過去五年，每年提供最多流動應用程式供市民下載的10個政府部門為何，並列出該等部門應用程式的主要功能及每年的維護成本；及

（三）鑑於政府表示，目標在今年年底前將所有政府流動應用程式所提供的服務，遷移至「智方便」的小程序平台上，以達至「一網通辦」，並在未來兩年內將政府的應用程式數量減半，有關工作的具體詳情及進展為何，包括會否將運輸署最新推出的「電子駕駛執照」流動應用程式整合至「智方便」內，以減省維護成本？

答覆：

主席：

就李鎮強議員提問的三個部分，經諮詢相關決策局及部門（局／部門）後，我現綜合回覆如下：

流動應用程式是政府推行電子政務的其中一種途徑，而「便民利民」一直是我們的指導原則。各局／部門會按其業務需要開發不同流動應用程式，供市民下載和使用。現時，34個局／部門正在營運75個流動應用程式，涉及不同的政策範疇。就問題（一）及（二）有關政府流動應用程式下載量最少及提供最多流動應用程式的部門等資料，現分別載於附件一及附件二。

數字政策辦公室（數字辦）已就開發及推行政府流動應用程式發布《流動應用程式實務指南》（《指南》），當中要求各局／部門在開發前須確立流動應用程式的目的和用途，並在推出後定期檢討，以具成本效益的方式更新、優化或整合現有的流動應用程式。在衡量成效時，除了下載量之外，各局／部門亦會綜合考慮流動應用程式的目標用戶群組（例如是否專為有特殊需要人士而設）、用戶意見、需求變化等因素。過去五年，局／部門已將約40個流動應用程式下架或整合至其他平台。

與此同時，為了加強統籌有關局／部門推出數字政府服務的工作，數字辦於今年年初發出通告，要求各局／部門須以「智方便」作為其新的流動應用程式或網上服務的優先服務提供平台，除非理據充分並獲得局／部門首長及數字辦的批准，局／部門不可開發全新和獨立於「智方便」平台的流動應用程式。

事實上，數字政府的其中一個政策目標，就是透過「智方便」中央平台讓市民大眾一站式獲取政府資訊和服務，以及辦理電子政務時可「一網通辦」。數字辦於今年在「智方便」推出「小程序平台」界面，是達至數字政府一體化的重要一步，市民屆時毋須下載不同局／部門推出的流動應用程式，便可透過「智方便」小程序直接登入並使用局／部門的電子服務。如局／部門因應其政策、用戶體驗及運作考慮需要繼續保留或推行個別流動應用程式（尤其是一些具備眾多或複雜功能的程式），局／部門亦可利用「智方便」把部分用戶常用流動應用程式功能轉移至「小程序平台」，大大提升市民使用電子政府服務的便捷度。

「智方便」的「小程序平台」將於今年十二月推出。我們預計目前政府流動應用程式中約20多個可於兩年內逐步轉移至「小程序平台」運行，另外有約20個程式會陸續下架，從而大大減少政府流動應用程式的數量。至於餘下約30個應用程式（包括運輸署的「電子駕駛執照」），數字辦會與相關局／部門持續檢視推行情況，以確保政府流動應用程式達致其「便民利民」的初心。"

答覆：

主席：

北部都會區（北都）是香港的戰略發展區域，也是我們為未來包括下一代作出的重大投資和建設。北都面積和未來人口約佔香港的三分之一，可提供3 000多公頃新發展土地，當中的產業用地推動創新科技（創科）以至其他產業發展，創造超過50萬個優質多元工作職位。北都也是未來公、私營房屋供應的重要來源，將提供約50萬個新住宅單位。北都的規劃亦能推動更佳的職住平衡，拉近工作地點與居所的距離，並提供完善居住和工作配套，改善生活質素。

就陳曼琪議員的提問，經諮詢相關政策局後，現回覆如下（因提問的第一至三部分有關連，我們為該部分作出綜合回覆）：

（一）至（三）在北都新發展區規劃上，為照顧青年人在不同人生階段的需要（例如就學、就業、住屋等），發展局連同相關部門一直以多元發展的方針進行土地規劃。

在就學方面，在進行北都新發展區的規劃時，我們會根據《香港規劃標準與準則》的規定及相關政府部門的要求，預留足夠土地發展中、小學，並會按各部門評估的需求，為幼稚園及其他政府、機構及社區設施預留土地或樓面空間。為支持香港發展成為國際專上教育樞紐，政府已預留用地發展北都大學城，一方面滿足青少年對專上教育的需求，另一方面助力香港打造「留學香港」品牌。此外，北都也預留大量用地作文化和體育發展之用，讓不同志趣的青少年都有廣闊空間盡展所長。

在就業和創業方面，北都採用「產業帶動」的發展模式，為不同產業帶來龐大的發展空間，創造大量優質且多元化的職位，配合青年的就業需求之餘，也締造有利的創業環境。以創科產業為例，北都的新田科技城，包括河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區（河套香港園區），將提供300公頃的創科用地，容納約700萬平方米的總樓面面積，相當於17個香港科學園，大大提升本港創科產業和初創企業的發展空間。此外，流浮山將定位為數碼科技樞紐，將利用先進科技，推動新經濟與傳統經濟融合，並成為孕育青年人才和初創企業的搖籃。北都內的新發展區正處於不同的規劃及建設階段，按規劃階段的假設估計將創造超過50萬個新工作職位，有關職位的規劃分布估計載於附件。而就這些新工作職位，各政策局及部門會因應各行業的最新發展及人力需求情況，提供相應的本地人才培訓計劃。

在住屋方面，北都將會是香港未來房屋供應的主要來源，預計可提供約50萬個新住宅單位，照顧社會不同階層家庭（包括青年家庭）的住屋需求。新發展區也提供契機回應公眾對更寬敞居住空間的訴求，根據《香港2030+：跨越2030年的規劃遠景與策略》（《香港2030+》）建議，北都較近期規劃的新發展區（包括新田科技城、牛潭尾、流浮山一帶、新界北新市鎮和馬草壟）的住宅用地規劃，均假設平均居住空間可增加百分之十至二十，為日後創造更多優質生活空間提供彈性。此外，我們亦預留彈性，可以靈活調整個別新發展區公私營房屋的比例，當中會考慮有關新發展區的產業定位，以及不同階層市民的需要。古洞北╱粉嶺北及洪水橋╱厦村新發展區的公私營房屋比例分別約為七比三以及六比四，當中的公營房屋單位包括租住公屋和出售資助房屋。其餘新發展區的公私營房屋比例則會按其定位及整體公、私營房屋的供求情況，於稍後的落實階段作靈活安排。

（四）在託兒服務方面，政府會根據以人口為基礎的規劃比率，為每25 000人口預留空間提供100個資助幼兒中心服務名額，以配合北都新發展區人口遷入所帶來的服務需求。在青少年支援方面，政府亦會為每12 000名屬於6至24歲年齡組別的兒童／青年規劃一間綜合青少年服務中心。至於青年驛站、青年宿舍等，如獲政策支持，可在北都的合適用地提供相關設施。為配合《青年發展藍圖》的政策目標，政府計劃在北都（例如在洪水橋／厦村新發展區）興建青年設施大樓及相關設施，協助青年發展，設施包括讓內地和香港青年交流、互動和協作的場地、青年活動及互動空間、青年創新和創業基地，以及青少年制服團體基地設施等。就幼稚園、小學以及中學的規劃，請見上文回覆。"
LCQ15: Measures in Northern Metropolis to support upward mobility for young people,2025-10-15 15:45,2025-10-15 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500516.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Maggie Chan and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

The Government has indicated in the 2025 Policy Address that the Northern Metropolis (NM), which covers a land area and planned population intake accounting for about one-third of Hong Kong's total, is our city's strategic development area. There are views that the development of the NM provides opportunities for young people in Hong Kong to achieve upward mobility and build a happy life. Regarding measures in the NM to support upward mobility for young people, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the Government has planned an upward mobility ecological chain for young people, covering such areas as education, employment, home ownership and entrepreneurship, in relation to the future development of the NM; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) given the projection in the 2025 Policy Address that the NM will create about half a million new job opportunities, of the distribution and proportions of such jobs by type; whether it has formulated training programmes and strategies for nurturing local talent in close alignment with such new jobs to assist young people in seizing the relevant opportunities;

(3) in light of the population influx into the NM brought by the aforementioned half a million new job opportunities, whether it has assessed the sufficiency of residential units in the NM to meet the demand of young families; if so, of the housing plan formulated based on the assessment results, as well as the respective numerical proportions of public housing units, Home Ownership Scheme units and private residential units therein; and

(4) whether it has planned to build facilities (including youth hostels, Youth Post hostels, childcare service centres, kindergartens, and primary and secondary schools) in the NM to support the working youth and their families; if so, of the details of the plan; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Northern Metropolis (NM), a strategic development area in Hong Kong, is a major investment and construction we have made for the future, including the next generation. With an area and planned population accounting for around one-third of Hong Kong's totals, the NM will provide more than 3000 hectares of new development land. The land for different industries in the NM would drive the development of innovation and technology (I&T) and other industries, and create more than 500000 quality and diversified job opportunities. The NM is also a key source of public and private housing supply in the future, which will provide approximately 500000 new residential units. The planning of the NM will also promote better home-job balance, bringing jobs closer to homes, as well as providing supporting facilities for residents and workers which improve the quality of life.

In response to the question raised by the Hon Maggie Chan, after consulting the relevant bureaux, the reply is as follows (as Parts 1 to 3 are related, we prepared a consolidated reply for these parts):

(1) to (3) In planning the land use in new development areas (NDAs) in the NM, the Development Bureau, in collaboration with relevant departments, has been adopting a diversified development approach in order to accommodate the needs of young people at different stages of life (such as education, employment and housing).

On education, during the planning of the NDAs within the NM, we have reserved sufficient land for the development of primary and secondary schools in accordance with the requirements of the Hong Kong Planning Standards and Guidelines and relevant government departments, as well as land or floor space for kindergartens and other government, institution and community facilities to meet the demands assessed by the relevant departments. To support Hong Kong's development into an international hub for post-secondary education, the Government has reserved land for the development of the Northern Metropolis University Town. This initiative will not only meet the demand of young people for post-secondary education, but also support Hong Kong to build the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand. Furthermore, a considerable amount of land has been reserved in the NM for cultural and sports development, providing ample space for young people with diverse interests to unleash their full potentials.

On employment and entrepreneurship, the NM adopts an ""industry-driven"" development mode, offering vast development space for various industries and creating a huge number of quality and diverse jobs, thereby meeting the employment needs of young people while fostering a favourable environment for entrepreneurship. To take the I&T industry as an example, the San Tin Technopole in the NM, including the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone (Hetao Hong Kong Park), will provide 300hectares of land for I&T, capable of offering a gross floor area of about 7million square metres, equivalent to 17Hong Kong Science Park, and significantly enhancing space for the development of the local I&T industry and start-ups. In addition, Lau Fau Shan will be positioned as a digital technology hub to capitalise on advanced technologies and promote integration of new and traditional economies, as well as to serve as an incubation base for young talent and start-ups. The NDAs within the NM are currently at various planning and construction stages. Based on the assumptions adopted at the planning stages, more than 500000 new jobs are expected to be created with the estimations of distribution by industry set out in the Annex. Regarding these new jobs, relevant bureaux and departments will provide corresponding local talent training programmes in response to the latest development and manpower requirements across various industries.

On housing, the NM will be the major source of future housing supply in Hong Kong, which is estimated to provide approximately 500000 new residential units to meet the demand for housing of families of different strata (including young families). The NDAs would also provide opportunities to respond to the public aspiration for larger home space. In line with the recommendations in the Hong Kong 2030+: Towards a Planning Vision and Strategy Transcending 2030 (Hong Kong 2030+), an enhanced home space by 10 to 20 per cent on average is assumed for the residential sites in the NDAs within the NM under more recent planning (including San Tin Technopole, Ngau Tam Mei, the Lau Fau Shan area, New Territories North New Town and Ma Tso Lung), offering flexibility for creating more quality living space in the future. In addition, we have allowed flexibility in adjusting the public/private split of housing supply in individual NDAs, taking into consideration the industry positioning of these NDAs and the needs of people from different strata. The respective public/private splits of housing supply in Kwu Tung North/Fanling North and Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen NDAs are approximately 70:30 and 60:40, with both public rental housing and subsidised sale flats in the public housing development. The public/private splits of housing supply in other NDAs will be flexibly determined at the later implementation stage, taking into account the positioning of respective NDAs and the overall supply and demand for public and private housing.

(4) On the childminding service, there will be 100 aided child care centre service places per 25000 general population in accordance with the planning ratio on a population basis, so as to cater for the service demand brought about by the population inflow in the NDAs within the NM. On youth support, one integrated children and youth services centre will be planned for every 12000children/young persons in the 6-24 age group. The NM could also provide suitable sites for relevant facilities such as Youth Post hostels and youth hostels, subject to policy support. In line with the policy objectives of the Youth Development Blueprint, the Government plans to build youth facility buildings and relevant facilities in the NM (for example, in Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen NDA) to support youth development. The facilities will include venues for exchange, interaction and collaboration between young people from the Mainland and Hong Kong, spaces for youth interactions and activities, innovation and entrepreneurial bases for young people, and base facilities for youth uniformed groups. As for the planning of kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools, please refer to the reply above."
HKMA announces second cohort of GenA.I. Sandbox to advance responsible AI innovation,2025-10-15 15:42,2025-10-15 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500258.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited (Cyberport), announced today (October 15) the second cohort of the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenA.I.) Sandbox. Building on the foundation of the first cohort, this coming cohort demonstrates a significant industry shift from experimenting with AI's capability to enabling its secure and reliable implementation.

From over 60 proposals, a total of 27 use cases from 20 banks and 14 technology partners have been selected (see Annex). All submissions were prioritised based on innovation, technical complexity and potential value to the industry.

A defining theme of this cohort is the proactive approach to AI governance, with use cases pioneering ""AI vs AI"" strategies, such as leveraging AI to conduct automated quality checks on AI-generated outputs, improving accuracy and consistency at a scalable level.

In response to the emerging risk of deepfake-related fraud, the Sandbox will also serve as a testing ground for advanced defence mechanisms. Several participants will conduct adversarial simulations, using AI to stress-test and fortify their systems against sophisticated digital fraud.

  Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA Mr Arthur Yuen said, ""The second cohort represents a major leap forward in making AI adoption safer and more robust. The diverse representation of banks in this cohort highlights the industry-wide consensus on AI's transformative potential. The growth in collaboration between the banking, technology, and academic sectors is a testament to our commitment to fostering the local fintech ecosystem. I would also like to express my gratitude to Professor Chan (Note 1), Professor Yang (Note 2) and Professor Yiu (Note 3)for their valuable expert advice as members of the selection committee.""

Participants will gradually onboard to the designated platform by Cyberport's Artificial Intelligence Supercomputing Centre later this year, with trials commencing in early 2026. Leveraging the GenA.I. Sandbox as the core, the HKMA will continue to share good practices and promote the responsible adoption of AI within the financial sector.

立法會九題：加強打擊騙案,2025-10-15 15:08,2025-10-15 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500382.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上簡慧敏議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

根據香港警務處資料，本港今年上半年共有20 760宗詐騙案，較去年同期上升4.3%，佔整體罪案數字約48%。關於加強打擊騙案，政府可否告知本會：

（一）自電話智能卡（電話卡）實名登記制實施以來，每年警方接獲的電話騙案數目，並按騙徒所持電話卡是否屬香港居民登記、受騙人士的年齡組別及職業背景以表列出分項數字；當局就防範騙案對不同群組人士的宣傳策略為何，以及有否評估當中成效；

（二）鑑於有業界人士指出，騙案頻生源於電訊商核實電話卡用戶身分的第一道防線存在漏洞，當局會否研究加強相關的身分驗證要求（例如規定電訊商在發卡前，必須當面核實客戶身分證明文件正本，以及探討可行方案以有效識別客戶用作登記的身分證明文件真偽等）；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）鑑於政府於今年七月十四日本會資訊科技及廣播事務委員會的會議上表示，擬修訂法例打擊不當使用已登記電話卡的行為，現時修例工作的進展及立法時間表為何；

（四）在進行第（三）項所述的修例工作時，政府會否研究劃分香港居民及訪客的電話卡登記總數上限，以加強打擊電話騙案；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（五）據悉內地及新加坡等地區已制定專門法例，禁止出售或租借銀行帳戶等行為，以加強打擊傀儡戶口，當局會否參考相關經驗，研究制定專門法例的可行性；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（六）鑑於法律改革委員會（法改會）在二○二二年發表《依賴電腦網絡的罪行及司法管轄權事宜》諮詢文件，其中建議香港法律就某些罪行適用於域外範圍，為更有效打擊包括在境外轉售電話卡予不法分子等跨境犯罪行為，當局會否參考法改會的建議，在相關法例適當加入「域外效力」的條文；如會，詳情為何；如否，當局有何其他有效策略應對跨境詐騙罪行；

（七）鑑於本年十一月三日生效的《2025年銀行業（修訂）條例》引入自願機制，讓銀行在發現懷疑受禁行為（例如洗錢）時，能透過香港金融管理局（金管局）指定的安全平台，與其他銀行及相關執法機構以電子方式分享相關企業及個人帳戶的資料，從而更好保障市民免受詐騙，金管局所指定的安全平台的詳情（包括現時系統的籌備進度）為何；至今共有多少間機構確認參與有關機制以分享帳戶資料；及

（八）為有效協助香港銀行核實在港內地居民及企業身分，做好「了解你的客戶」工作，以防範有人以不法手段在港開戶及詐騙貸款，現時推展跨境徵信互通和深港跨境數據驗證平台的工作進度為何，以及有否就該等措施制訂成效目標？

答覆：

主席：

詐騙是嚴重罪行。任何人干犯《盜竊罪條例》（第210章）第16A條「欺詐罪」，最高可判處監禁14年；若被控同一條例第17條「以欺騙手段取得財產」，最高可判處監禁10年。另外，任何人因詐騙得益而被控《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章）第25條「處理已知道或相信為代表從可公訴罪行的得益的財產」，最高可判處監禁14年及罰款500萬元。

就議員的提問，經諮詢商務及經濟發展局、財經事務及庫務局及通訊事務管理局辦公室（通訊辦），現回覆如下：

（一）電話智能卡實名登記制（實名登記制）第二階段於二○二二年實施，用戶可於同年三月起為其電話智能卡進行實名登記。警方自二○二二年所接獲的電話騙案數字如下：





二○二二年
二○二三年
二○二四年
二○二五年
			一至八月


案件（宗）
2 831
3 213
9 204
4 922




各類主要電話騙案的受害人年齡分布皆有所不同，就「假冒客服」及「猜猜我是誰」而言，二○二五年首八個月，超過一半受害人為60歲或以上，分別佔54%及58%。

二○二五年首八個月，超過七成涉及電話騙案的電話由本地打出。警方沒有就受害人的職業作分類統計。

防範騙案方面，警方持續分析最新騙案（包括電話騙案）的形勢及情報，適時發放最新防騙信息，包括透過記者會、警隊官方社交媒體帳號、守網者網站等平台向公眾介紹最新騙案手法，並向不同群組人士作針對性宣傳。

警方自二○二○年起推出防騙吉祥物「提子」，以親民互動的方式解釋騙徒的最新犯案手法及提供簡單易明的防騙信息，並在各社交媒體平台上發布以「提子」為題的防騙資訊，如《提子動畫廊》繪本等，亦安排「提子」在線下與青少年及中、小學生互動，以宣揚防騙信息，包括安排「提子入校園」，並以防騙宣傳車走訪中小學校園。

為加強防範學生及公眾誤墮電話及網絡詐騙陷阱，警方一直與電訊服務及社交媒體平台營辦商保持緊密溝通合作，包括透過電訊商派發防騙宣傳單張，並會不時更新防騙宣傳材料，提醒市民防範最新騙案手法。如發現有懷疑詐騙內容，警方會要求有關社交媒體平台即時移除，並採取適當的跟進行動。二○二五年一至八月，有關平台已按警方要求，審視及移除超過67 000個詐騙內容。

針對長者及退休人士方面，警方以「健康生活、遠離詐騙、幸運常伴」為主題，向長者及退休人士社群宣傳防騙信息，尤其是防範電話騙案，當中包括與體檢中心及衛生署長者健康中心合作推送防騙資訊、透過社福機構網絡及關愛隊等向長者派發防騙資訊包等。警方亦繼續透過耆樂警訊及其他社區網絡舉行防騙活動，其中耆樂警訊於二○二五年五月推出「耆樂科技隊長」訓練，內容包括學習使用「防騙視伏APP」，讓長者認識最新的騙案手法和網絡陷阱，鼓勵他們於社區宣揚防騙信息。

針對新來港人士及內地學生等電話騙案高危群組，警方早前與國家移民管理局、公安部刑事偵查局及香港入境事務處共同製作防騙視頻，並自二○二五年六月起在各口岸、內地出入境辦證大廳、小紅書、抖音等播放。警方亦透過入境處六個總區公眾服務站、勞工及福利局及各大專院校向新來港人士派發防騙宣傳小冊子及單張，當中包括防範電話騙案的方法。警方亦已推出「網上學習套件」，供包括新來港人士和內地學生了解騙案手法和應對建議。

另外，警方於二○二五年八月與Facebook及WhatsApp的母公司Meta舉行聯合記者會，發布涉及通訊軟件及社交網絡平台的最新騙案手法，以及營辦商的反詐措施，包括加強使用人工智能技術偵測和移除詐騙內容及帳號。

（二）至（四）自實名登記制於二○二三年二月全面實施以來，通訊辦一直按運作經驗持續推出不同優化措施，包括要求電訊商自二○二四年十月起以「智方便」作為香港身份證持有人在實名登記制下的預設登記方式。至於非持有香港身份證人士在網上登記平台進行實名登記的電話儲值卡，電訊商會先透過系統識別證件後啓動相關電話儲值卡，之後會以人手檢查所提供證件的真偽，如發現不合規登記的電話儲值卡會取消其登記。此外，所有電訊商必須定期抽查已登記的電話卡資料及加強核查可疑個案，並將涉嫌違法個案交予警方處理。截至二○二五年八月底，約520萬張電話儲值卡因客戶未能提供合乎登記要求的資料而被拒絕登記，另外有約367萬張未能遵從合規要求的電話儲值卡被取消登記。

政府正全面檢視實名登記制的整體運作，並於二○二五年七月向立法會資訊科技及廣播事務委員會介紹加強建議，包括大幅減少個人用戶（不論是香港居民或是非香港居民）可登記電話儲值卡的數量上限，由現時每人可向每間電訊商最多登記10張減至三張，並訂立新罪行打擊不當使用已登記的電話智能卡的行為。政府正檢視所收集的意見，並積極籌備法例草擬工作，以期在二○二六年向立法會提交相關法例修訂建議以供審議。

（五）警方針對騙徒常用的傀儡戶口作出重點打擊，摧毀詐騙產業鏈。二○二五年首八個月共拘捕4 906人涉及詐騙及洗黑錢罪行，當中約七成為傀儡戶口持有人。警方已調動人手及資源盡快處理涉及傀儡戶口的案件，並配合律政司加快檢控進度。

此外，警方自二○二三年底起，就涉及傀儡戶口的案件向法庭申請引用《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》第27條加重刑罰。截至二○二五年八月底，共169名傀儡戶口持有人的刑期增加一成至三成多，最終被判監21至75個月不等。警方會繼續宣傳成功加重刑罰的案例，以進一步加強阻嚇力。

警方亦與金融管理局（金管局）及銀行業界推出多項措施打擊犯罪集團利用傀儡戶口清洗黑錢，包括於二○二三年六月推出Financial Intelligence Evaluation Sharing Tool（FINEST），為銀行業界提供安全有效的電子平台，交換懷疑與金融罪行相關的企業客戶數據。警方亦為市民大眾及不同社群舉辦具針對性的宣傳教育活動，例如金管局及銀行業界合作，於零售銀行櫃位擺放反洗黑錢桌面展示架及貼紙，提醒有意開戶人士切勿跌入「租、借、賣戶口」的陷阱，並安排宣傳車走訪各區向市民派發宣傳物品。

此外，金管局一直密切關注詐騙和洗錢活動風險，並與銀行業界、執法機構及其他監管機構緊密合作，推出一系列措施，加強打擊詐騙活動，特別針對不法分子用作洗錢的傀儡戶口網絡。這些措施包括要求銀行更全面使用警方防騙視伏器數據，提早識別可疑帳戶並向客戶提示相關風險；修訂《銀行業條例》，促進銀行間資料分享；以及向銀行提供詳細指引，列明保障客戶及打擊傀儡戶口的良好做法。金管局亦致力進行宣傳教育，包括透過主要社交媒體發放帖文，以及與銀行業和執法機構進行一系列「切勿借／賣戶口」的宣傳工作，增加市民對打擊洗黑錢的認知和提升防範意識。

政府會繼續善用現有法例採取針對性行動打擊傀儡戶口，並密切留意相關成效，適時考慮是否需要檢視現有法例。

（六）法律改革委員會（法改會）轄下的小組委員會於二○二二年十月完成首階段關於依賴電腦網絡的罪行和司法管轄權的公眾諮詢工作，目前正進行第二階段研究，聚焦於利用電腦網絡擴大犯罪規模的傳統罪行。政府會密切留意法改會的研究進展和最終建議。

另一方面，香港警方一直採取積極措施，調查和收集情報以打擊詐騙罪行。警方並會加強與其他執法機構和相關持份者合作，共同打擊涉及詐騙的犯罪團伙及跨境／跨國犯罪組織。

其中，反詐騙跨境合作平台「FRONTIER+」自二○二四年十月起成立，至今成員包括澳洲、加拿大、香港特別行政區、印尼、澳門特別行政區、馬來西亞、馬爾代夫、新加坡、南韓以及泰國共10個國家及地區。在今年四月首次聯合行動中，「FRONTIER+」成功識別並瓦解多個跨境詐騙網絡，共拘捕 1 858人，涉及9 200多宗騙案，損失逾15億港元，行動中亦凍結32 000多個銀行戶口，攔截約1.6億港元騙款。

（七）金管局計劃透過兩個指定平台以促進《2025年銀行業（修訂）條例》下銀行之間分享資料。主要的平台是由警方運作的FINEST，目前已有10家銀行使用該平台來分享企業帳戶的資料。FINEST平台正進行升級，以便容納個人帳戶的資料分享。當升級完成時，10家銀行將會過渡到新的升級平台。另一個平台是由香港銀行同業結算有限公司旗下子公司運作的資訊平台，稱為ICLNet。金管局的初期目標是先讓上述10家銀行使用ICLNet作帳戶資料分享。目前，FINEST及ICLNet已經被銀行業界廣泛使用，因此業界對於使用這些平台並不陌生。金管局亦計劃逐步增加參與銀行的數目以加強資料分享成效。

金管局正與警方和銀行業界緊密合作，完成相關的準備工作，包括FINEST的系統提升和制定相關指引，目的是在條例生效後盡快落實措施，透過更廣泛的信息交換，進一步提升銀行打擊詐騙的能力。

（八）跨境徵信互通

自金管局與中國人民銀行於二○二四年推出跨境徵信互通業務試點安排以來，金管局一直與香港銀行和徵信業界跟進，落實及優化包括企業及個人層面的試點個案的測試工作，包括於今年四月起在流程上結合了深港跨境數據驗證平台的應用。數據南下方面，試點安排至今已協助超過20宗企業及個人客戶完成2.6億港元的貸款審批，及超過200間企業完成「認識你的客戶」及開戶程序。隨着試點安排至今已取得顯著進展，金管局於二○二五年十月十日舉辦了業界研討會，宣布將跨境徵信互通業務試點常規化，支持業界將現階段試點成果產品化，推出以市場為本的跨境徵信解決方案。同時，為滿足市場需要和反饋，金管局將繼續與人民銀行及其他內地有關部門保持密切聯繫，共同協作優化跨境徵信互通和深港跨境數據驗證平台，探討更多不同渠道落實企業和個人徵信信息的跨境傳輸，最終惠及內地與香港的企業及居民，服務實體經濟。

深港跨境數據驗證平台

深港跨境數據驗證平台利用區塊鏈等先進科技，為銀行提供安全、創新的方法驗證客戶自主攜帶的跨境數據。驗證平台自二○二四年五月在金管局與內地相關部委共同推動下成功上線試行後已經服務超過10家銀行和徵信機構，並落地超過10個業務場景，當中包括支持香港銀行驗證內地居民及企業提供的文件以更有效地進行開立帳戶及審批貸款相關的盡職審查及風險管理工作。

為了令銀行更方便使用驗證平台服務，金管局推動平台與商業數據通（CDI）在今年四月對接，有助銀行利用現有的CDI接口，更簡單直接使用平台。金管局將會繼續與政府和內地監管機構以及業界探索驗證平台的進一步發展，推進驗證平台在數據源和數據種類、大灣區內覆蓋範圍以及客戶體驗和介面等多方面的提升與擴容，便利香港銀行向在港的內地居民及企業提供銀行服務及管理相關風險。"
LCQ9: Stepping up efforts to combat fraud,2025-10-15 15:08,2025-10-15 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500368.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Carmen Kan and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

According to data from the Hong Kong Police Force, there were 20 760 ‍deception cases in Hong Kong in the first half of this year, representing a 4.3 per cent increase compared to the same period last year, and accounting for about 48 per cent of the overall crime figure. Regarding stepping up efforts to combat fraud, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of telephone fraud cases reported to the police annually since the implementation of the Real-name Registration Programme for Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) Cards, with a breakdown by whether the SIM cards held by the fraudsters were registered to Hong Kong residents, and the age groups and occupational backgrounds of the victims; the publicity strategies adopted by the authorities to prevent fraud among different groups of people and whether an assessment has been conducted on their effectiveness;

(2) as some members of the industry have pointed out that the frequent occurrence of fraud cases stems from vulnerabilities in the first line of defence where telecommunications operators verify the identities of SIM card users, whether the authorities will study ways to strengthen the relevant identity verification requirements, such as mandating that telecommunications operators must verify original copies of customers' identity documents on the spot before issuing SIM cards, and explore feasible solutions to effectively detect the authenticity of the identity documents used by customers for registration; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) as the Government indicated at the meeting of the Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting of this Council on July 14 this year that it intended to amend legislation to combat the improper use of registered SIM cards, of the current progress of the legislative amendment exercise and the legislative timetable;

(4) when carrying out the legislative amendment exercise as mentioned in (3), whether the Government will study setting separate upper limits on the total number of SIM cards that can be registered by Hong Kong residents and visitors, in order to step up the combat against telephone fraud; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(5) as it is learnt that places such as the Mainland and Singapore have enacted specific legislation to prohibit activities such as the sale or rental of bank accounts in order to step up the combat against stooge accounts, whether the authorities will make reference to such experiences and study the feasibility of enacting specific legislation; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(6) as the Law Reform Commission (LRC) recommended the extra-territorial application of Hong Kong law to certain offences in the Consultation Paper on Cyber-Dependent Crimes and Jurisdictional Issues published in 2022, and in order to combat cross-border crimes more effectively, including the resale of SIM cards to lawbreakers outside Hong Kong, whether the authorities will make reference to LRC's recommendations to incorporate an ""extraterritoriality"" provision into relevant legislation as appropriate; if so, of the details; if not, what other effective strategies the authorities have in place to address cross-border fraud crimes;

(7) as the Banking (Amendment) Ordinance 2025, which took effect on November 3 this year, introduces a voluntary mechanism for banks to share information of corporate and individual accounts via electronic means with other banks and relevant law enforcement agencies through secure platforms designated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) when they become aware of suspected prohibited conduct (e.g. money laundering), thereby better protecting the public from fraud, of the details of the secure platform designated by the HKMA (including the current progress of the system's preparation); the number of institutions that have so far confirmed their participation in this mechanism to share account information; and

(8) to effectively assist Hong Kong banks in verifying the identities of Mainland residents and enterprises in Hong Kong and properly carrying out the ""Know Your Customer"" procedures, so as to prevent individuals from opening accounts and obtaining fraudulent loans in Hong Kong through unlawful means, what is the current progress of implementing Cross Boundary Credit Referencing and the Shenzhen-Hong Kong cross-boundary data validation platform, and whether any performance indicators have been set for these initiatives?

Reply:

President,

Deception is a serious crime. Any person who commits the offence of ""fraud"" under section 16A of the Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210) is liable to imprisonment for up to 14 years, while any person charged with ""obtaining property by deception"" under section 17 of the same Ordinance is liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years. In addition, any person charged with ""dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" under section 25 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) for proceeds of deception is liable to maximum penalties of 14 years' imprisonment and a fine of $5 million.

  In consultation with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the Office of the Communications Authority (OFCA), the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) The second phrase for the Real-name Registration Programme for Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) Cards (RNR Programme)'s second phase was implemented in 2022, enabling users to start real-name registration of their SIM cards since March 2022. The number of telephone scam cases reported to the Police since 2022 is as follows:





2022
2023
2024
January to August 2025


Number of cases
2831
3213
9204
4922




The age distribution of victims varies across different types of major telephone scam cases. For ""impersonation of customer service staff"" and ""guess who"" cases, over half of the victims in the first eight months of 2025 were aged 60 or above, accounting for 54 per cent and 58 per cent respectively.

More than 70 per cent of the calls involved in telephone scam cases in the first eight months of 2025 originated from Hong Kong. The Police do not maintain a breakdown of the statistics on the victims by occupation.

Regarding scam prevention, the Police have been analysing the trends and intelligence of latest scam cases (including telephone scams), and have been releasing the latest anti-scam messages in a timely manner, including making use of platforms such as press conferences, social media accounts of the Police and the CyberDefender website to warn the public about the latest scam tactics. Targeted publicity was also launched for different groups of people.

The Police have introduced an anti-scam mascot ""The Little Grape"" since 2020 to explain the latest tactics of fraudsters and to disseminate simple, easy-to-understand anti-scam messages in a friendly and interactive manner. Anti-scam information is posted on different social media platforms using ""The Little Grape"" as the theme, such as ""The Little Grape"" Animation Picture book. Also, offline interactions between ""The Little Grape"" and primary and secondary students are arranged through visits to primary and secondary schools by ""The Little Grape"" and the anti-scam promotional vehicle to convey anti-scam messages.

To heighten the alertness of students and the public against telephone and online scams and pitfalls, the Police have been maintaining close communication and collaboration with telecommunications service providers (TSP) and social media platform operators. In particular, anti-scam promotional leaflets are distributed through TSPs. The promotional materials are updated from time to time, so as to remind members of the public to be watchful over the latest fraud tactics. Should suspected fraudulent content be found, the Police will request the social media platforms concerned to immediately remove the content and take appropriate follow-up actions. From January to August of 2025, the platforms concerned have reviewed and removed over 67 000 items of fraudulent content at the request of the Police.

For the elderly and retirees, the Police deliver anti-scam messages, in particular those on prevention of telephone scams, to these groups under the theme of ""live healthily and stay away from scams; good fortune is always around"". Specifically, the Police collaborate with health examination centres and Elderly Health Centres of the Department of Health to disseminate anti-scam information, and distribute anti-scam information packs to the elderly with the aid of social welfare organisation networks and the Care Teams. The Police also continue to organise anti-scam activities through the Senior Police Call and other community networks. Among others, the Senior Police Call launched the ""IT Captain"" training programme in May 2025, the content of which included teaching the elderly how to use the ""Scameter+"", enabling them to be aware of the latest scam tactics and cyber pitfalls and encouraging them to spread scam prevention messages in the community.

Targeting high-risk groups of telephone scam victims such as new arrivals and Mainland students, the Police have earlier on produced anti-scam video clips in collaboration with the National Immigration Administration, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security and the Immigration Department (ImmD) of Hong Kong. Starting from June 2025, the videos are broadcast across boundary control points, exit-entry service halls on the Mainland as well as Xiaohongshu, Douyin, etc. In addition, the Police distribute anti-scam booklets and leaflets to new arrivals through the six regional public service counters of the ImmD, the Labour and Welfare Bureau and various tertiary institutions. These materials include methods to prevent telephone scams. The Police have also launched an online learning package for new arrivals, Mainland students, etc, to learn about the scam tactics and advise them on counter measures.

Besides, the Police held a joint press conference with Meta, the parent company of Facebook and WhatsApp, in August 2025 to alert the public of the latest scam tactics involving messaging applications and social networking platforms. The public were also notified of the operators' anti-scam counter measures, which include the strengthened use of artificial intelligence technology for detecting and removing fraudulent content and accounts.

(2) to (4) Since the full implementation of the RNR Programme in February 2023, the OFCA has introduced various enhancement measures based on operational experience, including requiring TSPs to adopt ""iAM Smart"" as the default registration method for Hong Kong Identity (HKID) card holders since October 2024. For non-HKID holders registering pre-paid SIM cards (PPS cards) under the RNR Programme via an online registration platform, TSPs will first verify the identification documents through their system and then activate the relevant PPS cards, followed by manual checks to verify the authenticity of the identification documents provided. Any PPS cards found to be non-compliant with the regulatory requirements will have their registration cancelled. In addition, all TSPs are required to conduct regular sampling checks on the registered PPS card information, strengthen the verification of suspicious cases and refer suspected illegal cases to the Police for further handling. As at end-August 2025, around 5.2 million PPS cards were rejected for registration as clients failed to provide information in compliance with the registration requirements, and the registration records of about 3.67 million non-compliant PPS cards were deregistered.

The Government is comprehensively reviewing the overall implementation of the RNR Programme. In July 2025, the Government briefed the Legislative Council (LegCo) Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting on the enhancement proposals, which include significantly reducing the maximum number of registered PPS cards allowed for each individual user (both Hong Kong resident and non-Hong Kong resident) from 10 PPS cards per TSP per person to 3 PPS cards per TSP per person, and introducing new offences to combat improper uses of registered SIM cards. The Government is currently reviewing the feedback collected and actively preparing for the drafting of legislation, with a view to submitting the proposed legislative amendments to the LegCo for scrutiny in 2026.

(5) The Police have taken targeted enforcement actions against stooge accounts frequently used by fraudsters in order to destroy the fraud industry chain. In the first eight months of 2025, a total of 4 906 people were arrested for fraud and money laundering offences, of which about 70 per cent of the arrestees are stooge account holders. The Police have deployed manpower and allocated resources to expedite the handling of cases involving stooge accounts and are working with the Department of Justice to speed up the prosecution process.

Furthermore, since end-2023, the Police have applied to the courts for invocation of section 27 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance to seek enhanced penalties for cases involving stooge accounts. As at end-August 2025, the sentences of 169 stooge account holders have been enhanced by 10 per cent to more than 30 per cent, with terms of imprisonment ranging from 21 to 75 months. The Police will continue to publicise the cases with successful application for enhanced sentences to further increase the deterrent effect.

The Police have also launched a number of measures with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the banking sector to combat money laundering activities by criminal syndicates using stooge accounts. These include the Financial Intelligence Evaluation Sharing Tool (FINEST) launched in June 2023. This electronic platform provides a secure and efficient means for sharing data of corporate clients related to suspected financial crimes among the banking institutions. The Police also organise targeted publicity and education activities for members of the public and various groups in the community. For instance, with the collaboration of the HKMA and the banking sector, desktop display stands and stickers with anti-money laundering messages are placed at counters of retail banks to remind those intending to open bank accounts not to fall into the trap of ""renting, lending or selling their accounts"". Additionally, a promotional truck was arranged to tour around various districts, distributing publicity materials to members of the public.

Moreover, the HKMA has been closely monitoring the risks of scams and money laundering activities, and has worked closely with the banking industry, law enforcement agencies and other regulators to launch a series of measures to combat scams, specifically targeting stooge account networks that are used by criminals for money laundering. These measures include requiring banks to expand their use of the Police's Scameter database to identify suspicious accounts early and alert customers of the associated risks, amendments to the Banking Ordinance to facilitate information sharing among banks, and issuance of detailed guidelines to banks on good practices for protecting customers and combating stooge accounts. Furthermore, the HKMA has stepped up publicity and education efforts, including issuing social media posts and collaborating with banks and law enforcement agencies to organise a series of outreach activities under the campaign ""Don’t Lend/Sell Your Accounts"", with a view to raising awareness among members of the public about anti-money laundering and anti-scam.

The Government will continue to make good use of the existing legislations to combat stooge accounts through targeted actions, closely monitor their effectiveness and consider in a timely manner the need to review the existing legislations.

(6) A sub-committee set up under the Law Reform Commission (LRC) completed the first stage of public consultation on cyber-dependent crimes and jurisdictional issues in October 2022. The LRC is now conducting the second stage of the study, focusing on the traditional crime of leveraging computer network to expand the scope of criminal activities. The Government will closely monitor the progress of the LRC's study and the final recommendations made by the LRC.

Meanwhile, the Police have been taking proactive measures in investigation and intelligence gathering in order to combat the offence of fraud. The Police will also strengthen collaboration with other law enforcement agencies and relevant stakeholders to jointly combat criminal syndicates and cross-boundary/transnational criminal organisations involved in fraudulent activities.

Among others, the cross-border anti-fraud collaboration platform ""FRONTIER+"" was established in October 2024. As of now, the platform comprises a total of 10 countries and regions, namely Australia, Canada, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Indonesia, Macao Special Administrative Region, Malaysia, the Maldives, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand, as its members. During the first joint operation in April this year, ""FRONTIER+"" successfully identified and dismantled multiple cross-border fraud syndicates, resulting in the arrest of a total of 1 858 people, who were involved in more than 9 200 fraud cases and a total loss amounting to over HK$1.5 billion. More than 32 000 bank accounts were frozen and approximately HK$160 million fraudulent funds were intercepted during the operation.

(7) The HKMA intends to facilitate information sharing among banks under the Banking (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 (the Ordinance) through two designated platforms. The main platform is FINEST operated by the Police, which is already in use by 10 banks for sharing information of corporate accounts. FINEST is currently being upgraded to accommodate information sharing on individual accounts and the 10 banks will transition to the new upgraded platform when it is launched. The other platform is ICLNet, an information platform operated by a subsidiary of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited. The intention of the HKMA is to let the aforementioned 10 banks to use ICLNet for sharing information in the initial stage. Currently, FINEST and ICLNet have been widely used by the banking sector and banks are not unfamiliar with using these platforms. The HKMA also plans to gradually increase the number of participating banks in order to enhance the effectiveness of information sharing.

The HKMA is now working closely with the Police and the banking sector to complete the relevant preparatory work, including the system upgrade of FINEST and formulation of relevant guidelines. The objective is to implement the measures as soon as practicable after the Ordinance comes into operation to further enhance banks' ability to combat fraud through wider information sharing.

(8) Cross-boundary Credit Referencing (CBCR)

Following the launch of the pilot programme of the CBCR initiative by the HKMA and the People's Bank of China (PBoC) in 2024, the HKMA has been following up with local banks and credit reference agencies to implement and optimise the testing of end-to-end data transmission workflows for corporate and personal customers, which included the integration of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong cross-boundary data validation platform into the processing workflows in April 2025. So far, Southbound data transfers under the pilot programme have facilitated over 20 corporate and personal loans approval amounting to more than HK$260 million, and the ""Know-Your-Customer"" (KYC) and account opening processes of over 200 businesses. Following the successful pilot outcomes, the HKMA hosted an industry symposium on October 10, 2025 to announce, among others, the regularisation of the CBCR initiative, with a view to supporting the industry in productising the pilot outcomes into market-driven solutions. Based on market needs and feedback, the HKMA will continue to maintain close liaison with the PBoC and other relevant Mainland authorities to explore possible enhancements to the initiatives to facilitate more efficient and scalable transfer, which will in turn benefit businesses and residents on the Mainland and Hong Kong, and contribute to the real economy.

Shenzhen-Hong Kong cross-boundary data validation platform (DVP)

The DVP utilises advanced technologies such as blockchain to enable banks to validate the authenticity of cross-boundary data presented by their customers in a safe and innovative way. Since pilot launching in May 2024 with the support of the HKMA and relevant mainland authorities, the DVP has already provided services to over 10 banks and credit reference agencies and implemented more than 10 business scenarios, including to support Hong Kong banks to validate documents provided by Mainland residents and enterprises to conduct due diligence and risk management work related to account opening and loan approval in a more effective manner.

To make it more convenient for banks to use the DVP, the HKMA facilitated its connection with the Commercial Data Interchange (CDI) in April this year, allowing banks to more simply and directly access the DVP's services leveraging the existing CDI interface. The HKMA will continue to work with the government, relevant Mainland regulatory authorities and the industry to explore further enhancements and development of the DVP in terms of data types and sources, geographic coverage within the Greater Bay Area and customer experience and user interface, with a view to facilitating Hong Kong banks to provide banking services to Mainland residents and enterprises in Hong Kong while managing the related risks."

發言人表示，由於港鐵東涌綫近小蠔灣車廠的一段以道碴承托的路軌有五個監測點於七月十五日的上升記錄超逾20毫米的預設停工指標，上述小蠔灣站項目的嵌岩工字鋼樁工程於同日暫停。有關情況是在預設機制下發生，目的是監察鐵路附近範圍工程對運行中鐵路的潛在影響，一旦發現超出預設指標，便會要求暫時停工及探討緩解措施，以保障鐵路安全。政府於七月十七日公布情況（www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/17/P2025071700594.htm），按既定程序，只有在屋宇署滿意項目團隊的緩解措施；機電工程署（機電署）滿意港鐵公司已強化監測措施；以及港鐵公司確認復工不會對鐵路結構和運作安全構成影響，政府才會批准復工。

小蠔灣站項目的註冊建築專業人士早前向屋宇署提交了事件報告，以及緩解措施和連帶的修訂圖則。屋宇署經審視後同意緩解措施和修訂圖則，認為緩解措施能有效減低復工後相關路軌的上升及沉降幅度超越預設停工指標的可能性，並接納港鐵公司的加強監測措施。

機電署已檢視港鐵公司所提交有關鐵路運作安全的監察數據和評估報告，確認鐵路狀況及港鐵公司的監測措施符合安全運作要求。

此外，港鐵公司確認復工不會對鐵路設施結構及鐵路運作安全構成影響。

屋宇署和機電署人員於十月八日午夜視察相關的路軌，再次確認七月事件後完成的維護工程和修整的道碴軌段水平，均沒有對鐵路設施的結構安全和運作安全構成影響。

屋宇署、機電署及港鐵公司會繼續密切監察有關情況，包括繼續根據預設停工指標監察相關上升及沉降幅度，確保鐵路設施結構和鐵路運作安全。"

答覆：

主席：

就陳沛良議員的提問，現回覆如下：

政府按去年十二月口腔健康及牙科護理工作小組的發展策略建議，從而訂立口腔健康行動計劃。「社區牙科支援計劃」（支援計劃）自今年五月二十六日推出，屬於「做窄做深」策略，即聚焦幫助較難獲得服務的弱勢社群提供資助牙科服務的一項措施。現時每名合資格計劃參加者每180天可在計劃下申請接受資助牙科服務一次，資助服務範圍涵蓋預防性和治療性的口腔健康及牙科護理服務。如主診註冊牙醫評估後認為情況合適，計劃參加者可獲得指定的資助牙科服務，包括口腔檢查、緩解牙齒疼痛的藥物（如需要）、X光檢查、補牙和拔牙。

截至十月一日，共3 262名合資格人士參與計劃。所有計劃參加者除接受口腔檢查外，亦接受了一項或多於一項牙科服務，當中1 161名參加者獲處方緩解牙齒疼痛的藥物、2 235名接受了X光檢查、1 958名接受了補牙服務及1 059名接受了拔牙服務。

「2021年口腔健康調查」結果 顯示，每名香港成年人（35歲至44歲群組）及非居於院舍長者（65歲至74歲群組）分別平均有0.7顆及1.2顆未經治療的蛀牙。按調查結果，政府設定計劃下每名參加者每180天最多可獲三個「補牙或拔牙配額」，每個「補牙或拔牙配額」以一顆牙齒為單位。現時每名參加者平均使用1.8個「補牙或拔牙配額」， 1 808名（55%）參加者未有使用全數三個「補牙或拔牙配額」，而1 454名（45%）參加者已使用三個相關配額。這反映現時服務安排大致可應付參加者的需求。

參加者可按其意願選擇於18區任何服務點申請接受資助牙科服務，各區參與的共32間非政府組織在18區的服務點數目和參加者人數分區數字表列如下：

就推行支援計劃及「青少年護齒共同治理先導計劃」，政府於二○二五至二六年度的財政撥款合共為1.363億元。自該計劃於五月二十六日推出至今，政府沒有收到參加者的投訴。

截至十月一日，支援計劃已提供4 390次補牙服務和1 626次拔牙服務，兩者的比例約為三比一，反映計劃成功引導參加者在牙醫認為合適的情況下保存牙齒，符合現時政府口腔健康及牙科護理的策略。

支援計劃將於明年起擴闊受惠對象至無家者及擴大服務範圍，並將新增洗牙、根管治療（杜牙根）、移除牙橋和牙冠，以及鑲配活動假牙服務，為有經濟困難的弱勢社群提供更多預防性和治療性的資助牙科服務。支援計劃會於二○二六年接替關愛基金「長者牙科服務資助」項目，該項目將於二○二六年一月一日起停止接受申請。

現時共有32間非政府組織參與計劃，在79個服務點為合資格參加者提供服務，覆蓋全港18區，服務大致足夠應付需求。計劃自推出以來，衞生署一直積極於地區層面推廣計劃，包括為地區服務及關愛隊伍舉行簡介會、於18區的長者地區中心、長者鄰舍中心及綜合家庭服務中心舉辦口腔健康講座及宣傳計劃內容，並為合資格人士提供即場預約服務。而參與計劃的非政府組織亦會透過其網絡、與地區社福機構合作及舉辦外展活動等，積極向服務對象宣傳計劃，擴大計劃的社區覆蓋面。

政府會持續監察服務使用量和需求，適時檢討計劃並按需要及考慮所需資源，研究增添服務單位及服務點。"

Resumption of foundation works for MTRCL Oyster Bay Station project,2025-10-15 15:00,2025-10-15 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500226.htm,"âA Government spokesman said today (October 15) that consent has been given to resume the socketed steel H-pile works of the proposed MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) Oyster Bay Station project on Lantau Island today.

The spokesman said that since the upheaving readings recorded on July 15 at five monitoring checkpoints installed on a section of the MTRCL's Tung Chung Line (TCL) ballasted railway tracks near Siu Ho Wan Depot had exceeded the preset trigger level of 20 millimetres for works suspension, the socketed steel H-pile works of the aforementioned project were suspended on the same day. The situation occurred under the preset mechanism that aims to monitor the potential impact of construction works in the vicinity ofrailways under operation. Once the exceedance of the preset trigger level is observed, works will be suspended, and mitigation measures will be explored, ensuring the safety of the railway. The Government announced the situation on July 17 (www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/17/P2025071700605.htm). In accordance with the established procedures, resumption of works will only be allowed when the Buildings Department (BD) is satisfied with the mitigation measures adopted by the project team; the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) is satisfied with the enhanced monitoring measures by the MTRCL; and the MTRCL has confirmed that the resumption of works will not affect the structural safety of the railway facilities and the safety of the railway operation.

The registered building professional of the Oyster Bay Station project has earlier submitted to the BD an incident report, a proposal of mitigation measures and the associated amendment plans. After review, the BD has agreed to the mitigation measures and the amendment plans, as these measures can effectively minimise the potential risk of the upheaval and settlement of the relevant tracks beyond the preset threshold upon the resumption of works, and has accepted the enhanced monitoring measures taken by the MTRCL.

The EMSD has reviewed the monitoring data and assessment report submitted by the MTRCL in relation to the safe operation of the railway and confirmed that the condition of the railway and the MTRCL's monitoring measures meet the operational safety requirements.

In addition, the MTRCL has confirmed that the resumption of works will not affect the structural safety of the railway facilities and the safe operation of the railway.

The staff of the BD and the EMSD inspected the concerned railway tracks at midnight on October 8, and reconfirmed that the maintenance works completed and the reconditioned ballast track after the incident of July had no impact on the structural safety of the railway facilities and operational safety of the railway.

  The BD, the EMSD and the MTRCL will continue to closely monitor the situation, including the continuous monitoring of upheaval and settlement levels against the triggering limit, to ensure the structural safety of the railway facilities and the safe operation of the railway."
LCQ10: Community Dental Support Programme,2025-10-15 15:00,2025-10-15 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500408.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Pui-leung and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Health, Dr Cecilia Fan, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

  Since May 26 this year, the Government has launched the Community Dental Support Programme (the Programme) in collaboration with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to promote early identification and timely intervention of dental diseases among the underprivileged groups with financial difficulties through provision of subsidised services. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers, genders and ages of participants, as well as the distribution of their selected NGO-operated dental clinics (broken down by the 18 districts across the territory) since the launch of the Programme; the respective numbers of participants who have received the following specified subsidised dental services: (i) oral health assessment, (ii) medication for dental pain relief, (iii) X-ray examination and (iv) dental filling or extraction, and among which the number of participants who have used up the three ""Teeth Filling/Extraction Quotas"" within the 180-day cycle;

(2) of the respective (i) number of participating NGOs, and (ii) the number of dental service points and their distribution in the 18 districts across the territory since the launch of the Programme;

(3) of the financial provision earmarked by the Government for the Programme and the specific expenditure incurred since the launch of the Programme;

(4) whether the Government has received complaints from participants since the launch of the Programme; if so, of the main issues involved, as well as the Government's handling procedures; and

(5) whether the various indicators have met the Government's expectations since the launch of the Programme; of the measures put in place by the Government to encourage more NGOs and dental service points to participate, so that the service points can be distributed more evenly across districts to meet the demand for dental services from eligible persons?

Reply:

President,

  The reply in response to the question raised by the Hon Chan Pui-leung is as follows:

  The Government formulated the Oral Health Action Plan according to the development strategies and recommendations made by the Working Group on Oral Health and Dental Care in December last year. The Community Dental Support Programme (CDSP) was launched on May 26 this year, as part of the strategy of essential dental care services targeting underprivileged groups, focusing on providing subsidised dental services to underprivileged with difficulties in accessing dental care. Currently, each eligible participant can apply for subsidised dental services which cover both preventive and curative oral health and dental care services once every 180 days under the CDSP. Subject to the assessment by the attending registered dentist, a participant will be provided with specified subsidised dental services, including oral health assessment, medication for dental pain relief (when necessary), X-ray examination and dental fillings and extractions.

  As of October 1, a total of 3 262 eligible persons have participated in the CDSP. In addition to oral health assessments, all participants received one or more dental services: 1 161 of them were prescribed medication for dental pain relief, 2 235 received X-ray examinations, 1 958 received dental fillings, and 1 059 received extractions.

  The results of the Oral Health Survey 2021 showed that each adult (35 to 44 years old age group) and non-institutionalised older person (65 to 74 years old age group) in Hong Kong had an average of 0.7 and 1.2 untreated decay teeth respectively. Based on the results of the survey, the Government has set a maximum of three ""Teeth Filling/Extraction Quotas"" (Quotas) for each participant every 180 days under CDSP, with each Quota covering treatment for one tooth. Currently, each participant is using an average of 1.8 Quotas. 1 808 of the participants (55 per cent) have not used all three Quotas, while 1 454 of them (45 per cent) have used up the three Quotas, reflecting that the current service capacity can generally meet the demands of participants.

  Participants can choose any service point in the 18 districts to apply for subsidised dental services. The number of service points operated by the total of 32 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in 18 districts and the number of participants in each of the districts are tabled below:

  The financial provision in 2025 -26 for the implementation of the CDSP and the Primary Dental Co-care Pilot Scheme for Adolescents is $136.3 million. Since the launch of the CDSP on May 26, the Government has received no complaints from participants.

  As of October 1, the CDSP provided 4 390 dental fillings and 1 626 extractions. The ratio of the two is approximately three to one, which reflects that the CDSP has successfully guided participants towards tooth retention when the dentist considers it suitable, aligning with the Government's prevailing strategies on oral health and dental care.

  The CDSP will expand the beneficiary list from next year to cover the homeless, and expand its scope of services to include dental scalings, root canal treatments, removal of bridges and crowns as well as removable denture fittings, further enhancing subsidised preventive and curative dental services for the underprivileged with financial difficulties. The CDSP will supplant Community Care Fund Elderly Dental Assistance Programme (EDAP) in 2026. The EDAP will cease accepting applications from January 1, 2026.

  Currently, there is a total of 32 NGOs participating in the CDSP, providing services to eligible participants in 79 service points covering all 18 districts in Hong Kong. The service is generally sufficient to meet the demand. Since the launch of the CDSP, the Department of Health has been actively promoting the programme at the community level. This includes conducting briefings to district services and community care teams, holding oral health talks and promoting the programme in District Elderly Community Centres, Neighbourhood Elderly Centres and Integrated Family Service Centres in 18 districts, and providing on-site appointment booking services for eligible persons. In addition, participating NGOs have also utilised their network, collaborated with other community social welfare organisations and conducted outreaching activities, among other things, with a view to promoting the CDSP to target users and expanding the community coverage of the programme.

  The Government will continue to monitor the service usage and demand of the CDSP, timely review the programme and explore addition of service units and service points having regard to the demand and required resources."

Oilex and HNS exercises test marine pollution responses (with photos),2025-10-15 14:55,2025-10-15 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500206.htm," The annual marine pollution joint response exercises, codenamed ""Oilex 2025"" and ""Maritime Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS) 2025"", were conducted by various government departments this morning (October 15) at the waters off Ha Mei Wan of Lamma Island to test their marine pollution responses in the event of a spillage of oil and HNS in Hong Kong waters.

 In the test scenario, an oil tanker collided with a container vessel, leading to fuel oil spilling from the oil tanker and five containers loaded with Sodium Hydroxide falling overboard. Subsequently, an oil spill response team arrived at the scene and cleaned up the spilled oil on the sea surface. The Fire Services Department (FSD) and other response groups were also tasked at the scene to contain and handle the probable spilled Sodium Hydroxide as necessary to prevent threats to the nearby environment and facilities.

 In the exercises, various participating parties carried out a series of simulated response actions. After the simulated oil spill, the oil tanker anchored at the waters off Ha Mei Wan of Lamma Island,while a salvage team transferred the fuel oil from the damaged tank and patched the leak to stop further oil spillage at the source. Moreover, an oil pollution combat team deployed floating barrier booms to encircle the oil tanker and set up barrier booms in the vicinity to prevent the spill from spreading. The exercise also simulated the spraying of oil dispersant with water from pollution control vessels and a Government Flying Service (GFS) helicopter onto oil on the sea surface, as well as the use of oil skimmers and other equipment. Simultaneously, a shoreline cleaning team conducted a shoreline oil clean-up drill at Tai Wan To, a non-gazetted beach, on Lamma Island. In combating the simulated HNS spill, the response groups lifted the damaged containers out from the sea to stop the pollution at the source.

 The joint response exercises were co-ordinated by the Marine Department and the Environmental Protection Department. The participating government departments and organisations included the FSD, the GFS, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Government Laboratory and the Civil Aid Service, as well as several oil companies and a pollution control company jointly formed by them.

 The response exercises not only provided hands-on experience for response members but also helped relevant parties to adopt an effective emergency response strategy for preventing pollution according to the properties and extents of spilled substances."
立法會：政務司司長提交回應政府帳目委員會第八十四號報告書政府覆文致辭,2025-10-15 14:50,2025-10-15 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500539.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上提交政府帳目委員會（帳委會）第八十四號報告書政府覆文的致辭全文：

主席：

我今天向立法會提交政府覆文，回應政府帳目委員會今年七月二十三日向立法會提交的第八十四號報告書。

我歡迎帳委會的報告書，並且感謝帳委會主席邵家輝議員及各位委員付出的投入和貢獻。政府接納帳委會的各項建議，並在覆文中詳細交代相關政策局及部門的具體回應。帳委會就審計署署長第84號報告書內關於「屋宇署對強制驗窗計劃的管理」及「街道潔淨服務」兩個章節進行了公開聆訊。我在此重點說明兩個部門跟進帳委會建議措施和取得的進展。

屋宇署對強制驗窗計劃的管理

就強制驗窗計劃，屋宇署按「風險為本」的原則優化了揀選目標樓宇的機制，包括向過去一年曾經發生墮窗事故、而先前發出的驗窗通知已超過五年的樓宇，重新發出驗窗通知。屋宇署亦完成分析445宗墮窗事故的成因，歸納出多項風險因素；而跟進措施則包括把有較高墮窗風險的樓宇納入揀選準則，並透過加大教育和宣傳力度，特別在雨季、颱風季節及農曆歲晚，提高業主正確使用與保養窗戶及抹窗安全的意識。

就跟進驗窗通知的遵辦情況，屋宇署已加強內部督導和監察，透過由首長級人員領導的三層架構，定期檢視進度和適時將複雜個案上報至高層處理。另外，為加強監管並確保負責驗窗合資格人士的工作符合部門要求，屋宇署將抽查署方人員審核個案的目標增加兩成至每年600 宗。

屋宇署會繼續善用科技和精簡程序提升工作效率。屋宇署電腦系統於本年年底完成更新後，將自動化編製向未遵辦業主發出警告信，亦會適時提示署方人員按時完成工作。屋宇署亦會探討研發人工智能系統，從而更有效率地處理合資格人士就強制驗窗計劃呈交的相關表格。

最後，政府會於二○二六年上半年向立法會提交修訂《建築物條例》的條例草案，修訂建議將包括提升驗窗通知遵辦率的措施，例如提高不遵辦驗窗通知的定額罰款及最高罰則；以及對未有遵辦驗窗通知而導致傷亡或財物損毀的個案引入新罪行等，進一步加強阻嚇力。

街道潔淨服務

食物環境衞生署（食環署）致力為市民提供清潔衞生的生活環境。為實現這目標，署方在過去數年推出多項措施，以優化和加強街道潔淨服務的監察工作，並提升執法效率及推展宣傳教育。

在服務監察方面，食環署已更新工作指引和流程，並持續監察署方執勤人員及承辦商遵從情況，以加強對街道潔淨服務承辦商的表現監督。此外，食環署亦着手優化電子管理系統，讓承辦商及署方執勤人員以電子方式提交、更新及審批工作計劃和報告，進一步提升署方監察街道潔淨服務的效率。

為加強執法成效，食環署自二○一七年成立專責執法小隊，打擊違反潔淨法例的行為。自二○二三年十月起，亂拋垃圾及非法擺放廢物的定額罰款已大幅提高。對比罰款提高前後的12個月，食環署就這兩類行為發出的定額罰款通知書大幅減少三成，反映整體執法成效提高。為進一步提升專責執法小隊運作效率，食環署已更新小隊的工作紀錄及相關工作指引，亦會全面檢討隊伍數目、分布及編制等範疇。

此外，食環署會繼續檢視安裝網絡攝錄機地點以打擊非法棄置垃圾的情況，並計劃於一年內將安裝點由現時的500 多個大幅增加至逾1 500個，以進一步擴大監察範圍並提升執法效率。

食環署亦積極應用科技，提升街道潔淨服務的質素及效率。署方目前已廣泛應用配備高速清洗盤的小型洗街車，並正測試不同新設備，包括自動化清掃機械人、電動輔助手推車及以工業級機械狗搬運重物等。這些設備除提升工作效率外，亦有助減輕前線員工體力消耗及降低工傷風險。署方將積極推動這方面的工作。

此外，食環署不時檢討外判服務的安排，確保可以按運作需要、服務性質及效益等，採取最合適的方式提供服務。署方亦正檢視現行承辦商失責扣費金額及相關招標評分機制，並會積極考慮作出調整，以鼓勵承辦商提供優質服務。同時，食環署正檢討服務承辦商履行合約條款，特別是有關僱傭規定的核查機制。署方亦會檢視現行指引，以及探討增加與非技術員工會面次數的可行性，以確保承辦商遵循合約條款和保障員工權益。

主席，我再次感謝帳委會的努力和建議。相關政策局及部門會嚴格按照覆文所述的回應，全力落實各項改善措施。

多謝主席。"
LC: Speech by CS in presenting Government Minute in response to Report No. 84 of Public Accounts Committee,2025-10-15 14:50,2025-10-15 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500542.htm,"Following is the speech (translated from Chinese) by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, in presenting the Government Minute in response to Report No. 84 of the Public Accounts Committee in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

President,

Laid on the table today is the Government Minute (GM) responding to Report No. 84 of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) presented to the Legislative Council (LegCo) on July 23, 2025.

I welcome the Report of the PAC and am grateful for the devotions and contributions by the Chairman of the PAC, the Hon Shiu Ka-fai, and members of the PAC. The Government accepts PAC's various recommendations and sets out in detail in the GM the specific responses of the relevant bureau and departments (B/Ds). The PAC conducted public hearings on the chapters on Management of Mandatory Window Inspection Scheme (MWIS) by the Buildings Department (BD) and Street cleansing services of the Director of Audit's Report No. 84. I would like to highlight the key measures taken and progress made by the two departments in response to the recommendations.
 
Management of MWIS by the BD

With regard to MWIS, the BD has enhanced the mechanism for selecting target buildings based on risk-based principles, which includes re-issuance of MWIS notices to buildings involved in fallen window incidents in the preceding year with previous MWIS notices served for more than five years. The BD has also completed the analysis on the causes of the 445 fallen window incidents and identified multiple risk factors leading to such incidents. The follow-up measures include incorporating buildings identified as having a higher risk of falling windows into the criteria for selecting target buildings, strengthening the efforts in education and publicity, particularly during rainy and typhoon seasons as well as prior to the Lunar New Year so as to enhance owners’ safety awareness of the proper use, maintenance and cleaning of windows.

Regarding the follow-up actions on the compliance status of MWIS notices, the BD has strengthened internal supervision and monitoring by regularly reviewing the progress and promptly escalating complex cases to higher levels for handling through a three-tier structure led by directorate officers. Moreover, to ensure that the work of qualified persons (QPs) responsible for window inspection meets its requirements, the BD will raise the target number of sample checking and audit checks to be conducted by the BD staff by 20 per cent to 600 cases each year, thereby enhancing monitoring efforts.

The BD will continue to enhance work efficiency by leveraging technology and streamlining procedures. Upon completion of the system revamp by the end of this year, the BD's computer system will automatically generate warning letters to non-compliant owners and provide prompt notifications to BD staff to complete work in a timely manner. The BD will also explore the development of an artificial intelligence system with a view to processing relevant forms submitted by QPs under MWIS more efficiently.

Finally, the Government will introduce an amendment bill to the Buildings Ordinance into the LegCo in the first half of 2026. The proposed amendments will include measures to boost the compliance rate of MWIS notices, such as increasing the fixed penalty and maximum penalty levels for non-compliance with MWIS notices, and introducing a new offence of non-compliance with MWIS notices which ended up with personal injury or property damage with a view to further enhancing deterrence. 

Street cleansing services

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) is committed to providing a clean and hygienic living environment for the public. To achieve this goal, the Department has introduced various measures over the past few years to enhance and strengthen the monitoring of street cleansing services, enhance enforcement efficiency, as well as promote public education.

On monitoring of the services, the FEHD has updated guidelines and workflows, and has been continuously monitoring the compliance and execution by duty officers and contractors in order to step up monitoring of the contractor's performance in street cleansing. In addition, the FEHD is working to upgrade the electronic management systems to enable electronic submission, update and approval of work programmes and reports by duty officers of the contractors and the Department, so as to further enhance the Department's efficiency in monitoring the street cleansing services.

The FEHD has set up Dedicated Enforcement Teams (DETs) since 2017 to combat litter offences so as to strengthen the effectiveness of enforcement. Since October 2023, the fixed penalty for littering and unlawful depositing of waste have been raised substantially. Comparing the 12 months before and after the raise in penalty, the number of fixed penalty notices issued by the FEHD for these two types of offences has drastically reduced by 30 per cent, reflecting an improvement in enforcement effectiveness as a whole. To further boost the operational efficiency of the DETs, the FEHD has updated the work records of the teams and relevant operational guidelines. A comprehensive review will also be conducted on the number, distribution and establishment of the teams.

In addition, the FEHD will continue to review the situation of illegal deposit of refuse at locations with Internet Protocol cameras installed and plans to increase the installation points from 500-odd at present to more than 1 500 within one year, in order to further expand the monitoring areas and enhance enforcement efficiency.

The FEHD has also been actively applying technologies to improve the quality and efficiency of street cleansing services. Currently, the Department has widely used the mini-street washing vehicles equipped with pressure washer surface cleaners, and is testing various new equipment, including automated sweeping robots, electrically assisted trolleys and industrial grade robot dogs for transporting heavy items. Apart from enhancing work efficiency, such equipment can also help ease the physical burden on frontline staff and lower the risk of workplace injuries. The Department will proactively promote the work on this front.

In addition, the FEHD reviews from time to time the arrangements for outsourcing services to ensure the adoption of the most suitable mode of service delivery having regard to the operational needs, service nature and effectiveness. The Department is also reviewing the existing payment amount to be deducted in case of contractors' default and the related tender scoring system. Adjustments will be actively considered to encourage contractors to provide quality service. Meanwhile, the FEHD is reviewing the verification mechanism for contractor's compliance with contract terms, especially employment-related provisions. The Department will review existing guidelines and explore the feasibility of increasing the number of meetings with non-skilled staff so as to ensure compliance with the contract terms by contractors and protection of staff rights.

President, I would like to thank the PAC again for its efforts and suggestions. The B/Ds concerned will strictly adhere to their responses and implement various improvement measures as set out in the GM with full efforts. 

Thank you, President."
​立法會四題：清除危害道路安全的障礙物,2025-10-15 14:38,2025-10-15 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500429.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上李世榮議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

上月先後發生巴士司機在駕駛期間被路面輾起的鐵通插傷，以及巴士擋風玻璃遭路面彈起碎石擊中的事故，引起公眾高度關注路面障礙物對道路使用者造成的風險。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否採取措施加強清除公路上的障礙物，例如增加巡查次數、在路面增設閉路電視及完善清理流程等，以切實保障所有道路使用者的安全；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）政府會否檢討現行法例，就在行車道路丟棄或遺下可能危害道路安全物件的行為，提高罰款及其他罰則以加強阻嚇力；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

答覆：

主席：

政府非常關注道路安全，包括車輛在行車時須適當盛載或固定負載物的要求。就李世榮議員的提問，經諮詢香港警務處（警務處）、路政署及運輸署後，我現回覆如下：

（一）路政署委聘承辦商每日主動巡查及清掃轄下的快速道路，採用專設的道路清掃車，若發現障礙物包括建築物料等散落路面，承辦商會即時調派人手和設備加快清理。署方除定期審視承辦商的工作紀錄外，亦會實地抽查清掃效果。當接獲公眾投訴或報告後，路政署亦會迅速安排承辦商作即時清理，以減低路面障礙物對道路使用者造成的風險。

路政署為清理快速道路上的障礙物訂立服務承諾，以接獲轉介後1.5小時內到達現場為目標，並即時安排清理工作。過去三年，全部個案均達標。

此外，路政署在道路維護中亦積極應用創新科技，例如利用配備激光掃描設備及全球衞星定位技術的檢測車迅速識別路面坑洞及其他潛在缺陷，以全面掌握路面狀況及準確制定維修次序，提升安全及維修效率。

（二）根據《道路交通（交通管制）規例》（第374G章），司機須確保負載物適當地固定或盛載在車輛上，不可對任何人士造成危險。警務處負責就此執法，初犯者最高可處罰款五千元及監禁三個月。如多次被定罪，則最高可處罰款一萬元及監禁六個月。此外，運輸署亦根據政府隧道及管制區的規例於相關範圍內就未有穩妥固定負載物的車輛執法，違者最高可處罰款五千元及監禁六個月。

最近三年，各部門持續加強執法，而檢控數字有所下降，顯示執法和罰則有效。我們會繼續密切留意情況，適時檢視法例。此外，警務處亦持續監察嚴重及致命交通意外的數據，展開全港性專題執法行動，包括特別留意貨車的違規情況，例如剛於今年九月進行「打擊貨車違例行為」行動，以提升整體道路安全水平。

相關部門亦積極探索應用新科技，提升執法效率和道路安全。最近，警務處首次在非市區路段試驗使用無人機作交通錄影執法，打擊危險駕駛行為。警務處將會檢討成效，考慮擴展至其他地區或違例項目的可行性，例如負載物不穩固及超載等。

（三）現時政府隧道及管制區設有熱線電話，讓市民向營辦商報告事故。運輸署一直密切監察營辦商的表現，並定時監察熱線的運作情況。

就早前有市民表示於本年九月十五日至十六日上午未能成功以熱線聯絡大欖隧道營辦商一事，營辦商已向運輸署提交報告，指事發時電話對話錄音裝置的轉駁機制失靈，導致外部來電無法轉駁至隧道人員接聽。經緊急維修，系統已於九月十六日回復正常。由於營辦商未能及時接聽熱線，署方已責成營辦商必須加強隧道緊急事故的準備及應變，確保系統運作暢順。

我們認為營辦商未能有效營運24小時熱線的情況絕不理想，運輸署已按合約向營辦商發出失責通知書追究責任，營辦商已按合約要求作出賠償。署方會繼續嚴肅跟進事件，並加強監察熱線的運作情況。

現時市民可透過多個途徑向政府部門反映道路狀況。此外，運輸署計劃在更換隧道及管制區的交通管制及監察系統時，引入人工智能閉路電視偵測路面障礙物和路面事故，優化事故管理。

運輸署一直透過不同渠道進行宣傳和教育，提高貨車業界對載貨安全的意識。例如，根據法例制訂《車輛載貨守則》，就載貨安全提供指引；出版《貨車運輸通訊》和與貨車業界舉行定期會議；在交通燈控制器和隧道區內可變信息顯示屏發放提示信息。運輸署及警務處會繼續聯同道路安全議會進行宣傳教育，包括出版和派發《道路安全通訊》及透過社交媒體平台發放資訊等，加強道路使用者的安全意識。

多謝主席。"
LCQ4: Clearing obstructions which pose hazards to road safety,2025-10-15 14:38,2025-10-15 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500430.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Stanley Li and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

  Two incidents occurred respectively last month, including a case in which a bus driver was injured while driving by a metal rod propelled into the air from the road surface after being run over by vehicles, and another where a bus was struck by road debris on its windscreen. These incidents have aroused grave public concern about the risks posed by obstructions on road surface to road users. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1)whether it will take measures to step up clearance of obstructions on highways, such as by increasing inspection frequency, installing additional closed-circuit televisions along the roads, improving clearance procedures, etc, so as to effectively ensure the safety of all road users; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2)whether the Government will review the existing legislation to impose additional fines and other heavier penalties on behaviours concerning depositing or leaving objects on carriageways which may pose hazards to road safety, with a view to enhancing the deterrent effect; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3)whether it will review the existing mechanism for members of the public to report road obstructions, establish more convenient channels for reporting potential road safety hazards, such as by setting up dedicated hotlines and online platforms, etc, and step up road safety publicity and education efforts to encourage members of the public to proactively report potential road safety hazards and remove them under safe circumstances, thereby jointly preventing the recurrence of related accidents; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The Government has consistently placed great importance on road safety and the requirement for moving vehicles to properly contain or secure their loads. Having consulted the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), the Highways Department (HyD) and the Transport Department (TD), my response to the question raised by the Hon Stanley Li is as follows:

(1)The HyD engages contractors to carry out daily proactive inspections and cleaning of expressways under its purview using specialised road sweepers. Should any obstacles, including construction materials etc, be found scattered on the road surface, contractors will immediately dispatch personnel and equipment to expedite the clearance. In addition to regularly reviewing contractors' work records, the HyD also conducts on-site spot checks to evaluate the effectiveness of cleaning efforts. Upon receiving public complaints or reports, the HyD will also promptly arrange for contractors to conduct immediate cleaning to minimise the risks posed by road obstacles to road users.

  The HyD has established a performance pledge for clearing obstacles on expressways, targeting to arrive at the scene within 1.5 hours of receiving a referral and immediately arrange for clearance work. All cases over the past three years have met this target.

  Additionally, the HyD actively applies innovative technologies in the maintenance of carriageways. For example, inspection vehicles equipped with laser scanning devices and global satellite positioning technology are deployed to swiftly identify potholes and other potential defects on road surfaces. This enables a comprehensive understanding of road conditions and allows for the precise prioritisation of repair works, thereby enhancing safety and maintenance efficiency.

(2)Under the Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations (Cap. 374G), the driver shall ensure that any load is properly secured to or contained inside the vehicle and that its weight and manner in which it is placed in the vehicle shall not cause danger to any person. The HKPF is responsible for law enforcement against related contraventions. Any driver who contravenes the relevant regulation is liable to a maximum fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for three months on first conviction; and to a maximum fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for six months on subsequent convictions. Moreover, the TD also takes enforcement actions against vehicles failing to properly secure their loads in the area of government tunnels and control areas pursuant to the relevant regulations. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for six months.

  Over the past three years, all departments have consistently strengthened enforcement efforts. Prosecution figures have declined which indicates that enforcement and penalties are effective. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and review the law as appropriate. Moreover, the HKPF continuously monitors data on serious and fatal traffic accidents and conducts territory-wide enforcement operations in response, particularly targeting non-compliance by lorries. These include the ""Crackdown on Lorry Offences"" operation conducted in September this year, with the aim of enhancing overall road safety.

  Relevant departments are proactively exploring the use of new technologies to enhance the enforcement efficiency and strengthen road safety. Recently, the HKPF conducted the first trial of drone-assisted traffic enforcement on non-urban road sections to combat dangerous driving. The HKPF will review the effectiveness of the trial and consider the feasibility of extending the initiative to other areas or offence types, including insecure vehicle loads and overloading.

(3)Currently, the operators of government tunnels and control areas provide hotlines for members of the public to report incidents. The TD has been closely monitoring the performance of the operators and the operation of their hotlines regularly.

  Regarding the incident that members of the public were unable to contact the operator of Tai Lam Tunnel via the hotline from September 15 to the morning of September 16, 2025, the operator has submitted a report to the TD. The report indicates that at the time of the incident, the call transfer mechanism of the telephone conversation recording device malfunctioned, preventing external calls from being transferred to tunnel staff for answering. Following emergency repairs, the system resumed normal on September 16. Due to the operator's failure to promptly respond to the hotline, the TD has instructed them to strengthen their preparedness and contingency measures for tunnel emergencies to ensure the smooth operation of the systems.

  We consider the operator's failure to maintain effective 24-hour hotline operations unacceptable. The TD has issued a Notice of Default to the operator in accordance with the contract to pursue its liability, and the operator has provided compensation as contractually required. The Department will continue to follow up on this matter seriously and enhance monitoring of the hotline operations.

  Members of the public may report road conditions to government departments through multiple channels at present. To enhance incident management, the TD plans to introduce AI-based closed-circuit television systems for detecting road obstructions and incidents when replacing the traffic control and surveillance systems in tunnels and controlled areas.

  The TD has been conducting publicity and educational activities through various channels to enhance the goods vehicle trade's awareness of safe loading. For example, a Code of Practice for the Loading of Vehicles is compiled in accordance with the law, which provides guidelines on safe loading. The TD also issues the Goods Vehicle Trade Newsletter and holds regular meetings with the goods vehicle trade. Reminder messages are affixed on traffic signal controllers and displayed on variable message signs in tunnel areas. The TD and the HKPF will continue to work with the Road Safety Council to conduct publicity and educational programmes, such as publishing and distributing the Road Safety Bulletin, and disseminating information through social media platforms, to enhance road users' awareness of safety.

  Thank you, President."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-10-15 14:36,2025-10-15 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500535.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 15) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

LC: Speech by CS in presenting Government Minute in response to Annual Report of The Ombudsman 2024/25,2025-10-15 14:35,2025-10-15 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500521.htm,"Following is the speech (translated from Chinese) by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, in presenting the Government Minute in response to the Annual Report of The Ombudsman 2024/25 in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Mr President,

On July 2 this year, I submitted the Annual Report of The Ombudsman 2024/25 to the Legislative Council. Today, I submit the Government Minute (GM) to comprehensively respond to the recommendations as set out in the Annual Report.

The Government attaches importance to the practical, constructive, and actionable recommendations made by the Office of The Ombudsman (the Office) concerning the provision of public services, with a view to further promoting an efficient and citizen-oriented public administration. In the year 2024-25, the Office concluded 40 complaint cases by full investigations and completed eight direct investigations, making a total of 254 recommendations - a record high number in recent years. All relevant government bureaux, departments and public bodies have seriously examined the Office's reports and accepted all recommendations, reflecting the current-term Government's commitment to enhancing the management and efficacy of public services. Departments concerned have either implemented or are actively pursuing the follow-up actions to the Office's recommendations. Detailed responses are set out in the GM.

In addition, in recent years the Office has actively used mediation to handle complaints which do not involve or only involve minor maladministration, with a view to resolving issues in a non-adversarial manner and achieving win-win for all parties concerned. All relevant government bureaux, departments and public bodies have also fully supported and cooperated with the Office's mediation efforts. In 2024-25, the Office handled 555 cases through mediation - a threefold increase as compared with the previous year, and mediations were typically completed within just one day or a few days. The Government will continue to collaborate with the Office to promote mediation, aiming to expedite the assistance rendered to the public in resolving complaints.

To recognise government bureaux, departments and public officers' outstanding performance in complaint handling and public service delivery, the Office held The Ombudsman's Awards Presentation Ceremony in October 2024, presenting awards to six departments and organisations and 79 public officers.

We understand the community's rising expectations on public service delivery. In May this year, I met with The Ombudsman to discuss on strengthening the systems on departmental management and performance accountability. In this year's Policy Address, the Chief Executive announced the establishment of the Heads of Department Accountability System with a view to continuously strengthening departmental performance through institutionalised and systematic management, thereby fostering a culture of continuous improvement and boost public confidence.

Mr President, I wish to express my sincere gratitude to The Ombudsman and his professional team for their independent, objective and fair work in their investigations and mediation efforts, which provided support for the effective governance of the Government. A robust monitoring mechanism is the cornerstone of social progress; the work of the Office and government administration are complementary to each other. The Government will, as always, fully support the work of the Office and continue to provide efficient, quality and people-oriented public services to the citizens.

Thank you, Mr President."

Civil servants receive vaccines against influenza (with photos),2025-10-15 14:18,2025-10-15 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500330.htm,"  With a view to facilitating and encouraging civil servants in receiving influenza vaccinations, the Civil Service Bureau and the Department of Health continue to implement the Civil Service Eligible Persons (CSEPs) Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Pilot Scheme this year. For the first time, outreach vaccination services are being conducted at specified government offices on a pilot basis. About 110 CSEPs received influenza vaccines at the outreach station at the Central Government Offices (CGO) this morning (October 15).

  The Secretary for the Civil Service, Mrs Ingrid Yeung, and the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, spoke with civil servants receiving the influenza vaccines to listen to their views. The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, and the Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, also received their vaccines at the outreach station.

  Mrs Yeung said, ""It is better to receive the influenza vaccine sooner rather than later. As civil servants frequently interact with the public, being vaccinated can better protect their health and the health of the members of the public they serve, reduce the risk of workplace and community transmission of influenza, and minimise the impact on the delivery of public services due to illnesses in the civil service. I encourage more civil service colleagues to receive their vaccinations early, and I am pleased with the good response from colleagues today. The outreach vaccination service is efficient and convenient, allowing colleagues to complete their vaccinations with only a brief absence from work.""

  The CSEPs Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Pilot Scheme in 2025/26 has commenced and is open to all CSEPs aged 6 months or above. Those who have made an appointment can receive free seasonal influenza vaccines at families clinics. For details, please visit www.csb.gov.hk/english/admin/benefits/66.html.

  In addition, this year's pilot scheme provides vaccination services by appointment through the outreach stations, on a pilot basis, at specified government offices (the CGO, the Queensway Government Offices, the West Kowloon Government Offices, and the North Point Government Offices) on several dates between mid-October and November."

公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵及衞生署署長林文健與接種流感疫苗的公務員交談，聽取他們的意見。律政司司長林定國資深大律師及房屋局局長何永賢亦在外展站接種疫苗。

楊何蓓茵表示：「打流感針，宜早不宜遲。公務員經常有機會接觸市民，接種疫苗可以更好保障他們和他們服務的市民的健康，減低流感在工作間以至在社區傳播的風險，更可以減低公務員患病對公共服務的影響。我鼓勵更多公務員同事及早接種疫苗，亦很高興不少同事今日積極響應，而外展接種服務效率高且方便，讓同事只需短暫離開工作崗位便可完成接種。」

二○二五／二六年度公務員及合資格人士接種季節性流感疫苗先導計劃已經展開，對象為所有公務員及合資格人士（年齡六個月或以上），已預約人士可在公務員診所免費接種季節性流感疫苗。詳情請參閱：www.csb.gov.hk/tc_chi/admin/benefits/66.html

立法會五題：防止濫用人才入境計劃,2025-10-15 13:56,2025-10-15 14:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500266.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上李浩然議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的答覆：

問題：

據報有部分人士透過人才入境計劃來港產子後便離開，其目的只為了讓子女取得香港永久性居民身份，而非真正有意來港發展。有意見指出，有關做法不但有違人才政策原意，更為本港各項社會服務的資源規劃帶來不確定性。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）在現行人才政策下，有否機制防止「以來港發展為名，產子為實」的情況；

（二）為避免大量雙非兒童（即父母均非香港永久性居民但在香港出生）的情況重現，政府有否考慮設立機制，要求來港人才及其受養人在本港公私營醫療機構預約分娩時，須簽署聲明文件確認其留港發展意向，或要求其提交證明文件（例如在港的工作證明或出入境紀錄），以確定其已達到一定的留港日數要求；及

（三）有否評估人才入境計劃對香港長遠人口規模及結構的影響，以精準調控社會福利、住屋、醫療、教育等公共服務的資源分配？

答覆：

主席：

作為國際人才樞紐，香港一直歡迎外來人才來港發展，藉以豐富本地人才庫。為應對人口高齡化及人力短缺的挑戰，本屆政府自二○二二年底推出了一系列「搶人才」措施，包括推行以高薪和高學歷人士為目標的高端人才通行證計劃（高才通計劃），以及優化多項現有計劃，至今已吸引超過24萬不同界別的全球精英來港發展。其中，高才通計劃反應踴躍，超過九萬人已經來港，而首批簽證到期的高才有逾半成功續簽，大多投身關鍵產業，收入可觀，展現強大市場競爭力。香港在國際管理發展學院最近發布的《2025年世界人才排名》中躍升至歷來最高的第四位，成為亞洲之冠，足見人才政策路向正確且已見成效。

然而，成功吸引人才來港之後，如何「留人才」才是最大挑戰。政府除會繼續大力發展經濟及新興產業，提供有利環境讓本地及海外人才發展外，亦致力為人才提供所需支援，鼓勵他們落地生根，為香港發展作出貢獻。

就議員的提問，經諮詢醫務衞生局（醫衞局）、房屋局、教育局、入境事務處（入境處）和政府統計處（統計處）後，現答覆如下：

（一）及（二）正如我剛才提及，在全球人才競奪戰中，如何「留人才」是我們面對的挑戰。

經不同入境計劃來港的人才大部分都很年輕，七成在40歲以下，其中高才通計劃C類人才更幾乎全數在30歲或以下，他們正值事業打拼期，亦處於組建家庭的黃金年齡。政府的跟進調查顯示，來港人才考慮移居時其中一項非常重視的就是家庭因素，包括子女教育安排等。這反映「留人才」除發展機遇外，亦須兼顧人才家庭的整體需要，提供更全面的配套，加強人才及其家庭對香港的歸屬感。

外來人才是推動經濟發展的重要力量之一，以高才通計劃為例，估計可為香港帶來每年約340億元的直接經濟貢獻，相當於本地生產總值約1.2%。我們希望視這些人才為香港的一分子，因而須照顧他們跟其他香港市民一樣的家庭需要，以促進他們在港安居樂業。

現行受養人政策已容許人才攜同配偶及未成年子女來港生活，我們亦歡迎人才在港成家生育，扎根香港。這些新力軍現在及日後都是本地勞動力的重要來源，有助改善人口結構，緩解本地人口老化和生育率偏低的結構問題，為香港的可持續發展提供長期的人力支撐。

我必須強調，各項不同定位的人才入境計劃均設有清晰的申請資格與審批程序。現時法例下，任何人向入境處作出虛假申述或申報失實資料，一經定罪最高可被判罰款15萬及監禁14年。入境處設有嚴謹有效的機制，就人才入境計劃的每宗申請進行嚴格審批，以確保只有符合獲批資格及相關入境政策的人士才獲准在港居留。申請獲批的都是香港希望吸納、具競爭力的人才。據我們觀察，仍未獲聘的人才都有興趣在港長遠發展，並未發現有人所謂「以來港發展為名，產子為實」的情況。

政府明白社會期望有限的公共資源用得其所。現時來港人才只佔香港整體人口很低比例，並無對本地資源構成壓力。醫衞局現時並無計劃因應市民獲得香港居民身分的途徑而就預約分娩服務實施不同的限制或要求。不過，勞工及福利局（勞褔局）會持續留意來港人才的落戶情況，包括蒐集有關人才在港生育的數據，以便相關政策局作出更完善的資源規劃。如發現有濫用人才入境計劃的情況，政府會採取適當措施。

（三）統計處和勞褔局會分別定期編製最新人口和人力推算，以掌握推算期內香港人口和人力需求的變化趨勢，從而為政府在不同政策及資源分配上的規劃提供基礎。現時兩項推算均會考慮主要人才入境計劃的影響。下輪人口普查將於二○二六年進行，而勞褔局亦正開展人力推算的中期更新工作，預計在二○二六年第四季公布結果。

各政策局會因應人口變化及人力資源最新趨勢，持續檢視所負責措施的執行情況及成效，例如：房屋局會密切留意各類房屋的供求情況，並按需要適時調整相應政策；醫衞局會繼續深化醫療體系改革，確保香港醫療體系行穩致遠；教育局會不時檢視教育政策，切合社會需要。"
LCQ5: Preventing abuse of talent admission schemes,2025-10-15 13:56,2025-10-15 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500292.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Hoey Simon Lee and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

 It is reported that some individuals come to Hong Kong under the talent admission schemes but leave after giving birth to their children, with the sole purpose of obtaining the Hong Kong permanent resident status for their children, rather than a true intention to pursue their career in Hong Kong. There are views pointing out that such practice not only goes against the original intent of the talent policy, but also creates uncertainty to resource planning of various social services in Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether there is any mechanism under the current talent policy to prevent situations where individuals come to Hong Kong under the guise of career development but actually just to give birth;

(2) to avoid the recurrence of a large number of doubly non-permanent resident children (i.e. children born in Hong Kong but whose parents are non-permanent residents of Hong Kong), whether the Government has considered establishing a mechanism requiring talent coming to Hong Kong and their dependants to sign a declaration confirming their intention to remain in Hong Kong for career development when making delivery bookings at public or private medical institutions in Hong Kong, or requiring them to submit supporting documents (such as proof of employment in Hong Kong or immigration records) to confirm that they have met the requirement of staying in Hong Kong for a certain number of days; and

(3) whether it has assessed the impact of the talent admission schemes on Hong Kong's long-term population scale and structure, with a view to precisely controlling the allocation of resources for public services such as social welfare, housing, healthcare and education?

Reply:

President,

 As an international talent hub, Hong Kong has been welcoming outside talent to come to the city for development, thereby enriching the local talent pool. To address the challenges posed by an ageing population and manpower shortage, the current-term Government has since end-2022 implemented a series of measures to trawl for talent. These include the launch of the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) targeting talent with high income and academic qualifications, as well as enhancement of the various existing schemes. To date, more than 240000 global elites from diverse backgrounds have been attracted to come to Hong Kong for development. Among others, the TTPS has received enthusiastic responses, with over 90000 talents having arrived in Hong Kong. Among the first batch of TTPS entrants whose visas have expired, more than half successfully secured extension of stay. Most of them have joined key industries and earn competitive salaries, demonstrating strong market competitiveness. In the World Talent Ranking 2025 published recently by the International Institute for Management Development, Hong Kong's ranking leapt markedly to fourth globally, marking the highest-ever ranking topping Asia. This is clear evidence that the talent attraction policies are in the right direction with effective outcomes.

 Nevertheless, after the talents have been successfully attracted to come to Hong Kong, the greater challenge lies in retaining them. In addition to continuing the efforts in boosting the economy and the growth of emerging industries to provide a favourable environment for the development of local and overseas talent, the Government is committed to providing the necessary support for talent, encouraging them to settle down and contribute to Hong Kong's development.

 In consultation with the Health Bureau (HHB), Housing Bureau (HB), Education Bureau (EDB), Immigration Department (ImmD) and Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), my reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) As mentioned earlier, in the global competition for talent, our real challenge lies in how to retain them.

 The majority of talents admitted to Hong Kong under the various admission schemes are very young, with 70 per cent under the age of 40. In particular, nearly all admitted under Category C of the TTPS are aged 30 or below. They are at critical stages in their careers and also within the prime age range for starting families. The Government's follow-up surveys have revealed that family considerations, such as arrangements for children's education, are among the top priorities for incoming talent when making a relocation decision. This reflects that talent retention is not only driven by career opportunities but also has to take into account the overall needs of their families. More comprehensive support should be offered to strengthen the sense of belonging of talent and their families to Hong Kong.

 Outside talents is a vital driving force for our economic development. Taking the TTPS as an example, the entrants are estimated to contribute directly to Hong Kong's economy by an amount of some HK$34 billion per annum, which is equivalent to about 1.2 per cent of the local Gross Domestic Product. We hope to regard these talents as part of our community, and therefore must address their family needs just as we do for other Hong Kong residents, so as to help them live and work in contentment in the city.

 The current dependant policy allows talent to bring their spouses and minor children to reside in Hong Kong. We also welcome them to start families and give birth to children in Hong Kong so as to establish roots in the city. These new additions to our population are and will continue to be an important source of the local labour force, which would help improve the demographic structure and alleviate the challenges posed by the local ageing population and the low birth rate, providing long-term manpower support for Hong Kong's sustainable development.

 I must emphasise that the various talent admission schemes with different positionings all have clear eligibility criteria and vetting procedures. Under current laws, anyone who furnishes false information or makes false representation to the ImmD are liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and imprisonment for 14 years. The ImmD has a rigorous and effective mechanism in place for assessing each application under the talent admission schemes in a rigorous manner. This is to ensure that only applicants meeting the relevant eligibility criteria and immigration policies will be admitted into Hong Kong for stay. The approved applicants are all talents with competitiveness that Hong Kong aims to attract. Based on our observations, talent who have not yet secured employment are genuinely interested in pursuing long-term development in Hong Kong. We are not aware of anyone coming to Hong Kong under the guise of career development just to give birth.

 The Government understands the public expectation about proper use of limited public resources. At present, the incoming talent represents only a small fraction of Hong Kong's overall population, and have not put pressure on local resources. The HHB has no plan at the moment to impose different restrictions or requirements on maternity service bookings based on the route through which individuals obtain their Hong Kong residency. However, the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) will continue to keep in view the settlement of incoming talents in Hong Kong, including collecting data on talent's childbirth, to facilitate better resource planning by relevant policy bureaux. If any abuse of the talent admission schemes is detected, the Government will take appropriate action.

(3) To provide the basis for the Government's planning in various policy areas and resource allocation, the C&SD and the LWB regularly compile updated population and manpower projection respectively to understand the trend of change in Hong Kong's population and manpower needs during the projection period. Currently, these two sets of projections have taken into account the impact of the major talent admission schemes. The next population census is scheduled to be conducted in 2026, and the LWB is now conducting a mid-term update on the manpower projection, with the results expected to be released in the fourth quarter of 2026.

 The various policy bureaux will continuously review the implementation and effectiveness of the measures under their respective purviews in response to the latest demographic and manpower trends. For instance, the HB will continue to closely monitor the supply and demand of different types of housing and adjust the corresponding policies in a timely manner where necessary. The HHB will continue to deepen the reform of the healthcare system to ensure the viability of Hong Kong's healthcare system. The EDB will review education policies from time to time, with a view to meeting the needs of the society."
立法會一題：推動北部都會區發展的措施,2025-10-15 13:06,2025-10-15 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500403.htm,"​以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上林健鋒議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的答覆：

問題：

今年的《施政報告》提出加快發展北部都會區（北都）。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府表示會以包括「片區開發」等多元開發模式推動市場參與以加速北都發展，並擬在今年第四季及明年分別推出洪水橋，以及粉嶺北新發展區和新田科技城的「片區」試點，該三個片區的具體招標程序為何，以及何時公布相關時間表；

（二）據報政府計劃以「雙信封制」就北都部分土地項目進行招標，以便在評審過程中可同時考慮投標企業所帶來的技術、經濟和稅收貢獻等因素，有關招標的具體評分準則（包括技術與價格的各佔比重）為何；政府將如何確保評審過程公開透明；及

（三）北都的河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區的最新招租情況為何，包括目前已簽署租約的企業數目，以及首批租户預計開始營運的日期；當局有何進一步的配套及優惠措施吸引高端科創企業進駐園區？

答覆：

主席：

北部都會區（北都）是引領香港未來發展、推動產業轉型的重要引擎，也是香港與大灣區其他城市聯動發展的新平台，提升香港作為連接內地與國際的關鍵樞紐地位。由於北都幅員廣闊，投資龐大，香港特別行政區政府會採用創新及多元的發展模式，善用政府和市場資源推展計劃。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢創新科技及工業局後，我回覆如下：

（一）在「片區開發」模式下，投得項目的發展商會綜合開發較大規模的地塊，當中包括具商業價值的住宅和產業用地，以及公共設施用地。政府已提出三個「片區」試點，分別位於洪水橋／厦村新發展區（洪水橋）、粉嶺北新發展區和新田科技城。早前完成的市場意向徵集共收到22份意向書，有助我們敲定招標條款前了解市場看法。

我們計劃先為洪水橋「片區」於今年年底進行招標，而另外兩個「片區」則計劃於明年陸續推出。我們正因應市場意見，調整洪水橋「片區」的相關安排和要求，包括將私營房屋住宅用地由兩幅增至三幅，以及取消要求投標者興建一條主要道路以減少建設公共設施的要求，增加項目的盈利能力。「片區」內有三幅企業及科技園用地，原本我們只要求成功投得片區的企業發展和營運其中一幅，其餘兩幅只需完成土地平整後交還政府。我們正考慮在標書提供選項，讓願意參與建設片區內更多產業用地的投標者，在「雙信封制」的招標模式下為此額外承擔而獲得分數。另外，我們正考慮提供較長的建築規約，以及較有彈性的地價繳付安排，包括分期支付。我們年底招標時會公布最終安排。

（二）我們將靈活批撥北都內的土地，推動企業落戶和投資。如果是採用招標方式，可因應情況考慮是否單純看投標者出價，或採用「雙信封制」方式進行招標。最近創新科技及工業局推出的沙嶺數據園區用地，便採用了「雙信封制」招標模式，洪水橋「片區」亦傾向採用這種模式招標。採用「雙信封制」招標，將綜合考慮非價格和價格建議，並按個別情況制訂評審的比重和元素。以沙嶺的招標作為例子，非價格建議和價格建議的比重分別為百分之七十和百分之三十，非價格建議會評審投標者在投資和發展產業方面為香港帶來的貢獻，例如聘用人數、投資規模和啓用時間。為確保招標工作公開透明，評審準則會詳列於招標文件，讓投標者清楚理解項目要求和評分準則。政府會成立由相關政策局和部門組成的標書評審委員會，根據《物料供應及採購規例》客觀專業地評審標書。評審結果會提交予財經事務及庫務局轄下的中央投標委員會作審批。

（三）河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區（河套香港園區）第一期首三座大樓已落成。港深創新及科技園有限公司（港深創科園公司）正積極推進相關的招租工作，現時已經與近30家分別來自內地、香港及國際的企業、大學及研究機構就進駐河套香港園區深入磋商，其中相當部分已簽署租約，預計首批涵蓋生命健康科技、微電子、新能源及人工智能等支柱產業的租戶將於今年年底前正式投入營運。港深創科園公司的招租工作正持續進行中，簽署租約的企業和機構將會陸續有所增加。

港深創科園公司會提供相應的配套設施，例如人才公寓、商業及其他附屬設施，支援進駐企業及機構的營運。同時，公司正積極籌備在二○二五至二六年度內展開「河套港深創新及科技園培育計劃」，為初創團隊和企業提供資助和支援服務，發揮「以產聚才」的作用。此外，政府正探討透過籌備中的北都專屬法例為管理指定地區提供跨境流動的便捷方法，包括人流、數據流和物資流等，財政司司長亦領導政策局制訂優惠政策包，涵蓋批地、地價、資助或稅務減免優惠等，這些策略措施均有助吸引科研及高端製造業落戶香港包括河套香港園區。"
立法會十七題：在學校推動國民及國家安全教育,2025-10-15 12:50,2025-10-15 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500179.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上吳永嘉議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的書面答覆︰

問題：

二○二四年《施政報告》為愛國主義教育訂下一系列項目指標，當中包括推展「心繫家國3.0」聯校國民教育活動、三年內為約1 000位非主修歷史的初中中國歷史科教師提供培訓名額，以及在兩年內提供不少於1 000個高中中國歷史科教師學習圈培訓名額等。此外，今年《施政報告》表示政府會推廣內地的愛國主義教育設施，將其納入特區愛國主義教育基地，而教育局亦會設計建國歷史體驗行程等。政府在學校推動國民及國家安全教育的最新情況備受社會關注。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）各項愛國主義教育措施的最新推行情況為何，當中有多少項措施已經達標；會否為已達標的措施訂立更高的目標；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）鑑於國民教育涵蓋的範疇廣闊，相關學習元素蘊含於多個學術科目，當局未來訂立愛國主義教育的新指標時，會否涵蓋更多學科；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）鑑於教育局為教師舉辦了多輪《基本法及香港國安法》測試，相關測試的合格率分別為何；

（四）過去三年，每年有多少間學校申請「我的行動承諾」加強版撥款計劃，讓該等學校有更多資源加強於校內推展國民及國家安全教育；成功申請該計劃的比例，以及每個獲批申請平均取得的撥款金額分別為何；

（五）據報教育局近日更新中小學國家安全教育課程框架，以突出「大安全」概念，並將舉辦簡介會及教師培訓課程支援學校落實國家安全教育，相關簡介會和培訓課程的詳情（包括預計舉辦的簡介會場數，以及可為多少名教師提供培訓）分別為何；

（六）有關推廣內地愛國主義教育設施的詳情為何，包括預計被納入特區愛國主義教育基地的設施數目，以及該等設施的名稱為何；及

（七）教育局就設計建國歷史體驗行程的工作預計所需的時間及人手為何；預計何時可讓學校報名參與該等建國歷史體驗行程？

答覆：

主席：

國民教育一直是學校課程的宗旨之一，是學校教育不可或缺的部分。國民教育已經融入愛國主義教育的元素和精神。國史、國情、中華文化、國家地理、《憲法》和《基本法》教育、國旗、國歌、國徽等國家象徵和標誌、國家安全等與《中華人民共和國愛國主義教育法》相對接的重要內容，已納入香港中小學各學習領域和相關科目，以及幼稚園課程中，並與價值觀教育及全方位學習活動等互相緊扣，構成學生的重要學習經歷。

教育局持續透過「多重進路 、互相配合」的方式把愛國主義教育融入學校教育，包括優化課程、發展學與教資源、提供教師培訓、舉辦多元化的全方位學習活動（如課外實踐活動、內地考察），以及為學校提供資源和津貼等，以期能全覆蓋、全方位、跨學科及跨學段地支援學校將愛國主義教育融入日常學與教之中，加深學生對國家的認識，建立國家觀念，增強民族意識與愛國情懷。

就吳永嘉議員的提問，教育局回覆如下：

（一）及（二）二○二四年《施政報告》提出一系列在校園內外推展愛國主義教育的指標，其中七項措施已於二○二四／二五學年達標，餘下一項橫跨二○二四／二五至二○二六／二七三個學年，該項措施在二○二四／二五學年的推行情況亦符合理想。詳情如下：

聯校國民教育活動：「心繫家國3.0」聯校國民教育活動順利完成，參加人數遠超預期，超過50 000人次。
國家地理：完成試教計劃及製作國家地理資源庫，並持續發展國家地理的學與教資源，供學校參考及使用。
國民教育重點視學：在不少於50所學校進行國民教育重點視學，提升國民教育的質素和成效。
內地交流及考察活動：由二○二四／二五學年起，提供不少於30個「紅色資源」行程，供學生參與。
幼稚園家長活動：由二○二四／二五學年起，所有參加幼稚園教育計劃的幼稚園，須每年為家長舉辦一項或以上與國民教育相關的活動。
高中中國歷史科教師培訓：已於二○二四／二五學年提供超過1 000個培訓名額，並於新學年持續提供相關培訓。
小學人文科課程推展：已完成小一及小四年級課本評審工作，並提供超過9 900個培訓名額和持續提供學與教資源。小學人文科已於二○二五／二六學年開始推行。
餘下一項橫跨三個學年的指標已按既定進度開展和推進。由二○二四／二五學年起，計劃三年內為約1 000位非主修歷史的初中中國歷史科教師提供培訓名額；其中二○二四／二五學年，已有約400位教師參與培訓。新學年將會繼續提供培訓名額，支援教師完成系統培訓。


建基去年取得的成果，二○二五年《施政報告》進一步訂立以下指標（包括新增項目）：


由二○二五／二六學年起，「心繫家國」系列活動將恆常化和普及化，全力在學界以跨辦學團體和跨校形式推動愛國主義教育，進一步加強學生的國民身分認同和文化自信，並設定每學年不少於30 000人次的參與目標。
在二○二五／二六學年，繼續在不少於50所學校進行國民教育重點視學，提升國民教育的質素和成效。
由二○二五／二六學年起，學生內地交流及考察活動提供不少於40個建國歷史體驗行程。
在二○二五／二六學年，舉辦各項與國民教育相關的學生活動，預計不少於20萬學生人次參加。
在二○二五／二六學年（橫跨三年），繼續為非主修歷史的初中中國歷史科教師提供培訓名額。
在二○二六／二七學年，就優化高中中國歷史科和歷史科課程，提供1 500個教師培訓名額和持續提供學與教資源。


（三）由二○二三／二四學年起，所有公營學校、直接資助計劃學校及參加幼稚園教育計劃的幼稚園的新聘教師（包括新入職教師及轉校教師）均必須在《基本法及香港國安法》測試取得及格成績，方可獲考慮聘用。教育局於二○二二／二三至二○二四／二五學年共舉辦了16輪《基本法及香港國安法》測試，分別供學位程度和非學位程度人士參加，報名人數共約72 600人次，當中包括在職教師、擬入職教育行業的人士及準畢業生，共約55 570人次應考，測試的及格率逾九成。

（四）優質教育基金（基金）於二○二一年十一月中旬推出「我的行動承諾」加強版撥款計劃，旨在支援學校推廣國民教育、國家安全教育，以及媒體與資訊素養教育。按校本需要，公帑資助的中、小學（包括特殊學校）可向基金申請一項不超過30萬元的撥款計劃；已參加幼稚園教育計劃的幼稚園則可申請一項不超過15萬元的撥款。自計劃推出以來，約880所學校遞交計劃申請，並獲批撥款。一般而言，個別學校在推行項目時所需的額外資源存在差異，撥款金額乃根據個別申請內容而定，故平均撥款金額並未能充分反映計劃的實際情況。

（五）教育局已於二○二五年五月及七月公布更新版《香港國家安全教育課程框架》（《課程框架》）和27個科目的國家安全教育課程框架，涵蓋八個學習領域和公民與社會發展科，讓國家安全教育與時並進，為教師提供更清晰和全面的指引，幫助學校在已有的良好基礎上，進一步推動國家安全教育。

教育局於《課程框架》發布後四個月內，於八場簡介會向辦學團體代表、校監、校長及教師等持份者介紹《課程框架》的主要更新內容與重點，並說明各學習領域如何結合國家安全教育元素。教育局亦將於二○二五／二六學年提供不少於1 000個國家安全教育教師培訓名額，培訓課程包括實體及網上課程、考察、經驗分享會，以及學習圈等，提升教師的專業能力，以有效落實國家安全教育。

（六）今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年，在中央政府的支持下，坐落北京盧溝橋側的中國人民抗日戰爭紀念館已在今年八月二十一日正式設立為首個港澳青少年愛國主義教育基地 。

香港特別行政區（特區）政府會繼續推廣內地的愛國主義教育設施，並將其納入特區愛國主義教育基地，鼓勵更多香港學生和青年到訪，讓他們全面認識國家的歷史與發展成就。

（七）教育局於二○二五／二六學年設計的建國歷史體驗行程由二○二五年十月起陸續出發，並適時讓學校報名參與，如「『薪火相傳』平台系列：貴州歷史人文與民族生活探索之旅」，學生將到訪貴州長征文化數位藝術館，學習長征重要歷史事件，感受紅軍長征的艱難險阻和領悟長征精神。有關活動所需的人力資源已納入教育局的經常開支內。"
LCQ17: Implementation of national education and national security education in schools,2025-10-15 12:50,2025-10-15 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500167.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Jimmy Ng and a written reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

  The 2024 Policy Address sets out a series of task indicators for patriotic education. These include the launch of the ""Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country 3.0"" series of interâschool national education activities, the provision of training places within three years for about 1 000 junior secondary Chinese History teachers who are not major in History, and the provision of at least 1 000 training places within two years in learning circles for senior secondary Chinese History teachers. Furthermore, this year's Policy Address states that the Government will promote patriotic education facilities in the Mainland, making them the patriotic education bases of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and that the Education Bureau (EDB) will also design itineraries for students to experience the founding history of our country. The latest status of the Government's implementation of national education and national security education in schools has drawn significant public attention. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the latest status of the implementation of various patriotic education measures, and among them, the number of measures that have meet their targets; whether higher targets will be set for those that have already met their targets; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) given that national education covers a broad range of areas, and that relevant learning elements are embedded across multiple academic subjects, whether the authorities will include more academic subjects when setting new indicators for patriotic education in the future; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) given that the EDB has administered multiple rounds of the Basic Law and National Security Law Test for teachers, of the respective pass rates for these test rounds;

(4) of the number of schools applied for the Enhanced ""My Pledge to Act"" funding programme in the past three years, so that these schools are provided with additional resources to strengthen the implementation of national education and national security education in schools; the proportion of successful applications under the programme and the average amount of funding granted per approved application;

(5) as it is reported that the EDB has recently updated the national security curriculum framework for primary and secondary schools to highlight the concept of ""comprehensive security"", and will organise briefing sessions and teacher training courses to provide support for schools in implementing national security education, of the respective details of those briefing sessions and training courses, including the estimated number of sessions to be held and the number of teachers expected to receive training;

(6) of the details regarding the promotion of patriotic education facilities in the Mainland, including the estimated number of such facilities that will become the patriotic education bases of the HKSAR, and the names of these facilities; and

(7) of the estimated time and manpower required by the EDB to design itineraries for students to experience the founding history of our country; the expected timeline to make these itineraries available for schools to register for participation?

Reply:

President,

  National education has been one of the goals of the school curriculum and an indispensable part of school education. National education has already incorporated elements and spirit of patriotic education. Key contents which dovetail with the Patriotic Education Law of People's Republic of China, including Chinese history, national affairs, Chinese culture, national geography, Constitution and Basic Law education, national symbols and signs (such as the national flag, national anthem and national emblem), and national security, have been embedded in various Key Learning Areas (KLAs) and relevant subjects at the primary and secondary levels as well as the curriculum of kindergartens, and are closely intertwined with values education and life-wide learning activities to provide essential learning experiences for students.

  The Education Bureau (EDB) continues to adopt a multi-pronged and co-ordinated approach to integrate patriotic education into school education, such as optimising the curriculum, developing learning and teaching resources, offering training to teachers, organising diversified life-wide learning activities (covering out-of-classroom practical activities, Mainland study tours, etc.), and providing resources and grants for schools, with a view to providing comprehensive, all-round, interdisciplinary and cross-key stage support for schools to integrate patriotic education into daily learning and teaching, as well as helping students deepen their understanding of our country, develop a sense of national identity and enhance their national awareness and national spirit.

  The reply to the question raised by the Hon Jimmy Ng is as follows:

(1) and (2) The 2024 Policy Address puts forward a series of indicators on promoting patriotic education on and off campus. The target has been met for seven of the initiatives in the 2024/25 school year. The remaining initiative, scheduled for implementation over a period of three school years from 2024/25 to 2026/27, has also made satisfactory progress in the 2024/25 school year. Details are as follows:


Interâschool national education activities: The ""Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country 3.0"" series of interâschool national education activities were successfully held with an attendance exceeding 50 000, far higher than expected.
National geography: The EDB has completed the trial teaching scheme and developed the National Geography Resource Portal, and will continue to develop learning and teaching resources on national geography for reference and use by schools.
Focus inspections on national education: Focus inspections on national education were conducted in at least 50 schools to enhance the quality and effectiveness of national education.
Mainland exchange programmes and study tours: Starting from the 2024/25 school year, at least 30 routes with ""red resources"" have been provided for participation by students.
Activities for kindergarten parents: Starting from the 2024/25 school year, all kindergartens joining the Kindergarten Education Scheme (KES) are required to organise one or more activities relating to national education for parents each year.
Training for senior secondary Chinese History teachers: Provided more than 1 000 training places in the 2024/25 school year and will continue to provide such training in the new school year.
Implementation of the Primary Humanities curriculum: The EDB completed the review of the textbooks for Primary One and Primary Four, provided over 9 900 training places, and continued to provide learning and teaching resources. The subject of Primary Humanities has been implemented starting from the 2025/26 school year.
The remaining indicator for implementation over a period of three school years has been launched and taken forward as scheduled. The EDB has planned to provide training places for about 1 000 junior secondary Chinese History teachers who are not History majors within three years starting from the 2024/25 school year. In the 2024/25 school year, some 400 teachers attended the training sessions. Training places will continue to be offered in the new school year to support teachers in completing systematic training.


  Building on the outcomes achieved last year, the 2025 Policy Address further sets the following indicators (including new indicators):


Regularise and popularise the ""Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country"" series of activities starting from the 2025/26 school year and strive to foster patriotic education in schools through collaboration across school sponsoring bodies and among schools to further enhance students' national identity and cultural confidence, with a target annual attendance of no less than 30 000.
Continue to conduct focus inspections on national education in at least 50 schools in the 2025/26 school year to enhance the quality and effectiveness of national education.
Provide no less than 40 itineraries for students to experience the founding history of our country through Mainland exchange programmes and study tours starting from the 2025/26 school year.
Organise various activities on national education for participation by students in the 2025/26 school year, with an expected attendance of no less than 200 000.
Continue to provide training places for junior secondary Chinese History teachers who are not History majors in the 2025/26 school year (over a period of three years).
Provide 1 500 teacher training places and continue to provide learning and teaching resources for the optimised senior secondary Chinese History and History curricula in the 2026/27 school year.


(3) Starting from the 2023/24 school year, all newly-appointed teachers in public sector schools, Direct Subsidy Scheme schools and kindergartens joining the KES (including newly-joined teachers and teachers changing schools) are required to pass the Basic Law and National Security Law Test (BLNST) in order to be considered for appointment. From the 2022/23 to 2024/25 school years, the EDB conducted a total of 16 rounds of BLNST for degree holders and non-degree holders involving about 72 600 applicants in total, including serving teachers, those aspiring to join the teaching profession and prospective graduates. A total of about 55 570 candidates sat for the BLNST, and the passing rate was over 90 per cent.

(4) To support schools in promoting national education, national security education, as well as media and information literacy education, the Quality Education Fund (QEF) launched the enhanced ""My Pledge to Act"" funding programme in mid-November 2021. According to the school-based needs, publicly-funded primary and secondary schools (including special schools) may submit an application to the QEF for funding not exceeding $300,000; kindergartens joining the KES may submit an application for funding not exceeding $150,000. Since the launch of the programme, about 880 schools have submitted their applications with funding approved. Generally speaking, as the additional resources required for implementing the relevant projects vary among schools, and the amount of funding to be granted is determined based on the content of individual applications, the average amount of funding granted cannot fully reflect the actual situation of the programme with respect to its implementation.

(5) The EDB released respectively in May and July 2025 the updated Curriculum Framework of National Security Education in Hong Kong (the Curriculum Framework) and the curriculum frameworks of National Security Education for 27 subjects covering eight KLAs and the Citizenship and Social Development subject, so as to keep national security education abreast of the times, provide teachers with clearer and more comprehensive guidelines, and help schools further promote national security education upon the existing solid foundation.

  After the release of the above frameworks, the EDB has held eight briefing sessions within four months to brief stakeholders, including representatives of school sponsoring bodies, school supervisors, principals and teachers, on the main updates and highlights of the Curriculum Framework and elucidate how the elements of national security education can be incorporated into various KLAs. The EDB will also provide no less than 1 000 teacher training places relating to national security education in the 2025/26 school year. The training programmes will comprise, among others, face-to-face and online courses, study tours, experience sharing sessions and learning circles to enhance teachers' professional competence for the effective implementation of national security education.

(6) This year marks the 80th anniversary of victory in the War of Resistance and the World Anti-Fascist War. With the support of the Central Government, the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, located next to the Marco Polo Bridge in Beijing, has been established as the first Patriotic Education Base for Hong Kong and Macao Youth on August 21 this year.

  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government will continue to promote patriotic education facilities in the Mainland by making them patriotic education bases of the HKSAR, and encourage visits by more students and youths to help them comprehensively understand the history and culture as well as the development and achievements of our country.

(7) In the 2025/26 school year, a number of tours with itineraries designed to help students experience the founding history of our country have been launched starting from October 2025. Schools will be invited to participate in due course. For example, under the ""'Passing on the Torch' Platform Programme Series: An Exploration into the History, Humanities and Ethnic Culture in Guizhou"", students will visit the Guizhou Long March Culture Digital Art Museum, where they will learn about key historical events of the Long March, experience the hardships faced by the Red Army, and gain a deeper understanding of the Long March spirit. The manpower resources required for the relevant Mainland exchange programmes are subsumed under the recurrent expenditure of the EDB."
立法會二十題：青年宿舍計劃的推行情況,2025-10-15 12:47,2025-10-15 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500338.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上鄭泳舜議員的提問和民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟的書面答覆︰

問題：

政府推出青年宿舍計劃已逾13年，由政府全資興建的七個青年宿舍項目中，目前只有兩個投入服務。此外，政府在二○二三年擴大該計劃，資助非政府機構租用合適酒店和旅館轉作青年宿舍（資助計劃），至今已有六個項目獲批。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）五個由政府全資興建但尚未投入服務的青年宿舍項目的最新進度為何，以及該等項目有否出現延誤；如有，原因為何；鑑於政府就2025-2026財政年度開支預算回覆本會議員問題時表示，青山公路及灣仔救世軍街的兩個項目分別處於施工前工程及技術可行性研究階段，政府是否仍會繼續該兩項興建計劃；

（二）資助計劃下的六個青年宿舍項目的最新入住率及租戶數目分別為何；

（三）鑑於於資助計劃規定，青年宿舍項目的青年租戶須每年參加不少於200個小時的社區或志願服務以回饋社區，青年租戶就上述要求的達標率為何（按項目列出）；據悉有青年人擔心未能達到社區服務的時數要求而未有申請入住青年宿舍，政府有否評估有關要求在鼓勵青年回饋社區上的成效；及

（四）據報位於通州街的首個由私人住宅物業轉作青年宿舍項目的部分宿位租金達7,600元至7,800元，而據悉雖然有關租金水平高於政策所訂（即租金水平應在同區附近相似單位市場租金的60%以內），但外界對該項目宿舍的質素反應正面，政府日後會否再接納以私人物業轉作青年宿舍用途的項目申請，又或是否已收到其他同類申請；有否評估，日後該類項目的租金會否有下調空間？

答覆：

主席：

青年宿舍計劃是一項重要的青年發展措施，除了回應青年對擁有自住空間的期望外，我們亦希望租戶在住宿期間透過參與青年宿舍提供不同的支援及訓練而有所得益。民政及青年事務局（民青局）一直以多管齊下的方式，積極落實青年宿舍計劃，其中包括全數資助非政府機構在未盡其用的土地上興建青年宿舍，以及推出青年宿舍計劃－將酒店和旅館轉作青年宿舍用途的資助計劃（資助計劃）等。現時計劃下推出的青年宿舍有八間，合共提供超過3 700個宿位。

就鄭泳舜議員提問的各部分，現回覆如下：

（一）現時由政府全資興建的青年宿舍項目共七個。首兩個由香港青年協會及保良局營運的青年宿舍已分別於二○二○年及二○二三年落成啓用，合共提供超過1 700個宿位。三間分別由香港女童軍總會、香港青少年發展聯會和東華三院正在興建的青年宿舍將於二○二六年起陸續落成，合共提供約1 000個宿位。至於香港聖公會福利協會有限公司及救世軍兩個項目亦正分別進行施工前工程及技術可行性研究。

（二）資助計劃自二○二三年推出至今已批出六個項目並已投入營運，合共提供約2 000個宿位。截至二○二五年八月底，除一般的租戶流轉外，六間已運作一年或以上的青年宿舍（包括由政府全資興建的青年宿舍及資助計劃的項目），房間入住率平均約八成半。

（三）青年宿舍計劃是一個推動青年增值和發展的平台，讓他們可以發揮所長、回饋社會。我們希望青年租戶在住宿期間，可以靈活參與青年宿舍的活動與訓練和地區或志願服務，從而自我增值，擴闊社交網絡，以及更有效規劃個人發展的目標。同樣地，青年宿舍所在社區亦會得益於青年租戶提供的地區服務，令弱勢社羣得到青年人的直接幫助，建立更廣闊的朋輩網絡，長遠有助構建和諧社會。現時青年宿舍整體運作暢順，而營運青年宿舍的非政府機構亦有安排租戶參與青年宿舍的活動（例如創業培訓、身心發展、職場文化等）和地區外展或志願服務。由於推出的青年宿舍的位置、規模及設施各有不同，營運的非政府機構會就其個別實際情況，訂定日常管理安排及營運方式，包括舉辦活動的種類、次數及形式等。民青局會持續監察青年宿舍的運作，因應其實際情況檢討資助計劃的運作安排，並會按需要調整執行細節。

（四）青年宿舍的租金會根據其地點、房間大小、生活配套，以及非政府機構提供的活動及服務等而釐定，租戶可按個人需要及經濟能力作選擇。民青局會繼續以多管齊下的方式，積極推展青年宿舍計劃。我們亦會和理念一致的相關持份者合作，研究以不同方法增加青年宿舍供應，讓更多青年受惠。"
LCQ20: Implementation of Youth Hostel Scheme,2025-10-15 12:47,2025-10-15 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500341.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Vincent Cheng and a written reply by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

It has been over 13 years since the Government launched the Youth Hostel Scheme. Of the seven youth hostel projects whose construction is fully funded by the Government, only two have been put into service. Furthermore, the Government expanded the Scheme in 2023 by subsidising non-governmental organisations in renting suitable hotels and guesthouses for use as youth hostels (the Subsidy Scheme), with six projects approved to date. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the latest progress of the five youth hostel projects whose construction is fully funded by the Government but not yet put into service, and whether there have been any delays in these projects; if so, of the reasons for that; given that in the reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on the Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 2025-2026, the Government indicated that the two projects at Castle Peak Road and Salvation Army Street, Wan Chai were respectively at the ""pre-construction works"" and ""technical feasibility studies"" stages, whether the Government will continue with these two construction projects;

(2) of the latest room occupancy rate and number of tenants of the six youth hostel projects under the Subsidy Scheme respectively;

(3) given that it is stipulated under the Subsidy Scheme that youth tenants of youth hostel projects shall participate in no less than 200 hours of community or volunteer services each year to give back to the community, of the attainment rates of youth tenants in terms of the above requirement (set out by project); as it is learnt that some young people have refrained from applying for youth hostels due to concerns about failing to meet the community service hour requirement, whether the Government has assessed the effectiveness of this requirement in encouraging young people to give back to the community; and

(4) as it has been reported that the rent of some hostel places in the first youth hostel project converted from private residential housing located at Tung Chau Street ranges between $7,600 and $7,800, and it is learnt that that although the rental levels are higher than those stipulated under the policy (i.e. rental levels being within 60 per cent of the market rent for similar flats in nearby areas of the same district), the response from the community to the quality of hostel in this project has been positive, whether the Government will accept further applications for converting private properties into youth hostels in the future, or whether it has already received other similar applications; whether it has assessed if there is room for reducing the rent of such projects in the future?

Reply:

President,

The Youth Hostel Scheme (YHS) is an important youth development initiative. Apart from meeting young people's aspirations of having their own living space, we also hope that youth tenants will benefit through participating in the various support and training activities provided by youth hostels during their stay. The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) has been proactively implementing the YHS through a multi-pronged approach, which includes fully funding non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to construct youth hostels on under-utilised sites, and launching the YHS - Subsidy Scheme for Using Hotels and Guesthouses as Youth Hostels (the Subsidy Scheme). There are currently eight youth hostels launched under the YHS, providing over 3 700 hostel places in total.

In response to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Vincent Cheng, our reply is as follows:

(1) There are currently seven youth hostel projects whose construction is fully funded by the Government. The first two youth hostels run by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups and the Po Leung Kuk have commenced operation upon completion of construction in 2020 and 2023 respectively, offering a total of over 1 700 hostel places. Three youth hostel projects under construction by the Hong Kong Girl Guides Association, the Hong Kong Association of Youth Development and the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals are expected to be gradually completed from 2026 onward, offering a total of about 1 000 hostel places. The Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui Welfare Council Limited's project and the Salvation Army's project are undergoing the pre-construction works and technical feasibility studies respectively.

(2) Since the launch of the Subsidy Scheme in 2023, six projects have been approved and put into use, providing about 2 000 hostel places in total. As at end-August 2025, except for the usual tenant turnover slots, the average room occupancy rate of the six youth hostels (including youth hostels whose construction is fully funded by the Government and projects under the Subsidy Scheme) that have operated for at least a year is about 85 per cent.

(3) The YHS offers a platform to promote youth enrichment and development, enabling them to unleash their strengths and contribute to society. We hope that, through flexible participation in activities/training at youth hostels and community/voluntary services during stay, youth tenants may achieve self-enrichment, expand their social networks and effectively set personal development goals. Meanwhile, the communities where the youth hostels are located will also benefit from the community services provided by youth tenants. This in turn helps the underprivileged obtain direct support from young people and establish a wider peer network, which is conducive to building a harmonious society in the long run. At present, the overall operation of the youth hostels has been smooth. The NGOs operating the youth hostels have also arranged youth tenants to participate in activities at the youth hotels (such as entrepreneurship training, physical and mental development, and workplace culture) and community outreach or volunteer services. As the location, scale and facilities of each youth hostels differ, taking into account their actual circumstances, the NGO operators will make day-to-day management and operational arrangements accordingly, including the type, number and mode of activities to be organised. The HYAB will continue to monitor the operation of the youth hostels, review the implementation arrangements of the Subsidy Scheme according to actual circumstances, and adjust the execution details when necessary.

(4) The rent charged by a youth hostel is determined by its location, room size, ancillary facilities as well as the activities and services to be provided by the NGOs. Youth tenants may, according to their own needs and financial means, choose among different youth hostels. The HYAB will continue to take forward the YHS proactively through a multi-pronged approach. In order to benefit more young people, we will also continue to collaborate with relevant stakeholders sharing our vision to explore different ways to increase the supply of youth hostels."
立法會十九題：提升九龍公園設施,2025-10-15 12:45,2025-10-15 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500316.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上江玉歡議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆︰

有意見認為，九龍公園作為本港市區大型公園之一，擁有豐富歷史遺產，而且地理位置優越。然而，隨着時代變遷，園內部分設施日漸老化及使用率偏低，整體發展潛力尚未得到充分發揮。關於提升九龍公園設施，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年九龍公園各項主要設施（例如游泳池、體育館、兒童遊樂場、歷奇樂園等）的使用人次及使用率，以及滿意度調查結果為何，並按設施類別列出分項資料；

（二）鑑於有意見指出，與九龍公園同屬市區大型休憩空間的維多利亞公園，因經常舉辦多元化大型活動而成為市民及遊客的熱門去處，過去三年該兩個公園相類設施（例如游泳池、體育館／運動場地、兒童遊樂場等）的使用情況的比較為何；有否具體分析該兩個公園設施的使用率出現差異的主要原因；

（三）當局有何恆常機制及具體措施，以定期檢查、維修及更新九龍公園的設施，以確保該等設施符合公眾需求並維持良好狀態；有否制訂優化方案增加九龍公園對本地市民及遊客的吸引力（例如改善園內空間的規劃及設計、增辦多元化活動等），從而提升園內設施的使用率；

（四）當局會否考慮以公私合營的模式為九龍公園進行翻新工程，讓私營機構參與特定園區的設計、營運及維修保養工作，以減輕政府的財政負擔並加速更新設施；及

（五）鑑於政府於去年公布改建九龍公園內前威菲路軍營58座為中華文化體驗館，以及在鄰近的尖沙咀天文台總部興建副樓以提供包括公眾教育資源中心及展覽廊等設施，政府如何將上述項目與九龍公園的現有設施及活動進行整合，以打造統一的休憩、文化及旅遊體驗空間；會否就上述的項目及整合工作設立跨部門協作機制，以發揮協同效應，從而提升區內遊客流量及市民參與度？

答覆：

主席：

康樂及文化事務署（康文署）致力在轄下公園提供多元化的康體和休閒設施，以滿足市民在消閒和康樂活動方面的需要，推廣健康生活模式和普及體育運動。九龍公園是康文署轄下市區大型公園之一，佔地13公頃，提供全面的動態和靜態康樂設施，一直深受市民歡迎。

就江玉歡議員的提問，我現回覆如下：

（一）過去三年，九龍公園主要設施的使用率或訪客人次載列如下：




平均使用率
二○二二年
二○二三年
二○二四年


體育館
			（主場館）
98.3%
96.5%
98.2%








訪客人次
二○二二年
二○二三年
二○二四年


游泳池
521 000
661 000
657 000


百鳥苑
136 000
168 000
185 000


鳥湖
266 000
346 000
366 000




康文署沒有備存兒童遊樂場和歷奇樂園使用人次的相關資料。

根據二○二五年七月至八月進行的問卷調查，絕大部分（85%）受訪者對九龍公園整體滿意程度為「非常滿意」或「滿意」。

（二）維多利亞公園與九龍公園均設有動態和靜態設施，為受歡迎的大型公園，兩者相類似的設施為游泳池和兒童遊樂場。

康文署沒有備存有關兒童遊樂場使用人次的資料。就游泳池而言，過去三年，九龍公園和維多利亞公園游泳池的使用人次載列如下：




到訪人次
二○二二年
二○二三年
二○二四年


九龍公園游泳池
521 000
661 000
657 000


維多利亞公園游泳池
469 000
554 000
540 000




市民會因應其居住地點、工作地點和作息時間等選擇鄰近的游泳池游泳，因此各個游泳池的到訪人數受一系列的因素影響。另外，維多利亞公園與九龍公園內的部份設施亦可供團體租用以舉辦不同規模及類型的活動，既為訪客提供多元化的遊園體驗，亦為不同機構提供優質的活動場地。過去三年，不同團體租用九龍公園以舉辦嘉年華、展覽及比賽等活動超過110次（例如香港國際手球錦標賽、香港室內賽艇錦標賽暨慈善長途接力賽、「國慶75周年紅旗飄揚齊歡呼」活動、全民太極日、香港漫畫星光大道第四期開幕禮等）；而維多利亞公園同期則有超過40次租用，當中包括多項大型活動（例如農曆年宵市場、香港花卉展覽、中秋綵燈會、渣打香港馬拉松及工展會）。

（三）及（四）為持續提升公共服務水平，康文署一直參考訪客和工務部門的意見，為九龍公園制訂各項設施的恆常維修及大型改善計劃，以不斷提升公園的訪客體驗，確保設施的安全性和舒適性，並為訪客提供一個更具吸引力的休閒空間。

在二○二四至二五年度的改善計劃中，康文署除為九龍公園進行恆常的維修及保養工作外，已完成中國花園和兒童遊樂場的翻新工程、以及健身設施和香港漫畫星光大道的優化工程，讓訪客可以享受更好的遊園體驗。另外，康文署在剛完成的水景花園噴水池翻新工程中，增設特別設計造型的熊貓擺設，亦同時優化戶外的洗手間，引入以功夫為主題的設計元素，增添視覺吸引力。至於二○二五至二六年度的改善計劃則會包括歷奇樂園的洗手間翻新工程、百鳥苑及花圃的美化工程等，以進一步提升公園的整體環境，為訪客提供更舒適的休憩空間和更豐富的自然景觀。

康文署會不時檢視公園設施的使用情況，在資源和場地條件許可的情況下，按需要適時制訂和推行合適的設施優化工程，以繼續為九龍公園增添特色，增加吸引力。

此外，在公私合營的管理方面，康文署會視乎公私合營模式的商業可行性和機會，並持開放態度，引入創新思維，積極考慮是否採用公私合營的建議，以提升設施的服務質量，務求為市民帶來更優質的康樂設施和更豐富的訪客體驗。

（五）康文署將改建九龍公園內前威菲路軍營58座及加建新翼，成為一所旨在弘揚中華文化的中華文化體驗館。體驗館將設有多用途的戶外空間，同時糅合九龍公園的自然環境，既可用作舉辦與中華文化相關的活動，亦為市民和旅客提供一處集文化元素與自然景觀於一身的中華文化體驗空間。體驗館亦會善用科技提供多元化的互動體驗和實物學習活動，以吸引市民和旅客參與。"
立法會二題：「BUD專項基金」,2025-10-15 12:45,2025-10-15 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500374.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上陳祖恒議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的答覆：

問題：

二○二五年《施政報告》宣布向「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」（「BUD專項基金」）注資14.3億元，並擴大資助地域範圍。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有業界人士反映，「BUD專項基金」下的簡易申請計劃（「申請易」）極受業界歡迎，政府會否考慮將「申請易」的項目資助上限由10萬元調高至30萬元；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）政府會否考慮將「BUD專項基金」的適用範圍進一步擴大至所有境外市場，以與明年整合至該基金的「中小企業市場推廣基金」的適用範圍看齊，從而更好地支援業界開拓內銷、傳統及新興市場；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於政府經營帳目有望於下一財政年度錄得盈餘，政府會否考慮將「BUD專項基金」的資助配對比率，調整為政府與企業以一對一比率分擔總核准開支，以協助業界升級轉型；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」（「BUD專項基金」）是政府支援中小企業的其中一項措施，目的是支持本地企業升級轉型及拓展多元化市場。由二○一二年成立至二○二五年九月，「BUD專項基金」共批出近12000宗申請，涉及總資助額約75億元，惠及約7800家企業。政府自二○一八年起多次優化「BUD專項基金」，包括注資共77億元、擴闊資助地域範圍、分階段提高每家企業的累計資助上限由50萬元至700萬元，以及推出「申請易」和「電商易」等。

就陳祖恒議員的提問的三個部分，現回覆如下：

（一）「申請易」於二○二三年六月推出，旨在加快審批涉及特定措施而資助金額為10萬元或以下的申請，其申請表格、所須遞交的證明文件要求及審批安排均已簡化，而申請處理時間亦較「BUD專項基金」一般申請的服務承諾大幅減少一半至30個工作天內完成。

截至二○二五年九月底，「申請易」共批出760宗申請，平均資助額約為7.2萬元。我們相信維持現時每宗10萬元的資助上限已可滿足大部分企業的需要。此外，我們亦需確保公帑用得其所，故釐定「申請易」每宗申請款額的上限時，需小心平衡資助款額和潛在財政風險。我們認為目前的安排是合適的。

另外，為了讓企業更迅速地獲得資助，以應對多變的經濟環境，我們自二○二五年三月起已優化「申請易」的安排，讓每間企業由之前每六個月只可遞交一項申請，放寬至每三個月可遞交一項；同時亦增加了建立網上銷售平台為可獲資助的項目措施。

（二）「BUD專項基金」現時的資助地域範圍涵蓋40個已與香港簽署自由貿易協定（自貿協定）及／或促進和保護投資協定（投資協定）的經濟體，佔二○二四年香港對外商品貿易總值約80%。行政長官於二○二五年《施政報告》宣布進一步擴大「BUD專項基金」的資助地域範圍，覆蓋多八個包括「一帶一路」國家在內的經濟體，亦即把基金適用的地域範圍增加20%，以協助中小企業拓展更多元化的市場。同時，鑑於「中小企業市場推廣基金」將於二○二六年七月整合至「BUD專項基金」，我們會加強宣傳和協助企業透過「BUD專項基金」——「申請易」參與展覽會和出口推廣活動。

香港正與多個經濟體探討簽訂投資協定，其中與卡塔爾的投資協定談判已大致完成，雙方將在各自完成所需內部程序後簽署協定。隨着香港日後簽署更多自貿協定或投資協定，「BUD專項基金」資助適用的地域範圍將進一步擴闊。我們亦已自二○二五年三月起擴大「電商易」的資助地域範圍至東南亞國家聯盟10個國家。

（三）多年來，「BUD專項基金」一直積極支援中小企業，期間亦推出了多輪優化措施。同時，企業對政府資助的需求近年大幅攀升，「BUD專項基金」二○二四年的申請宗數較二○一九年增加超過320%，而基金近九成的資助是於最近六年（二○一九年至二○二四年）批出。

為確保「BUD專項基金」的財政可持續性，政府於二○二五年三月推出措施，當中包括調整基金的資助比例至1（政府）：3（企業），希望企業能更慎重選擇適當及具成本效益的項目，並更願意投放資源。有關措施剛於二○二五年三月推出，我們需時檢視成效，故未有計劃調整基金的資助比例。

支援中小企業是政府其中一項重要政策，因此政府於今明兩個財政年度會向「BUD專項基金」注資共超過30億元，惟我們需確保資助計劃的財政可持續性，令更多企業能獲得支援及讓受惠面保持廣泛，故政府會以適時和聚焦的方式審慎運用公帑，以應對複雜多變的經濟環境。

除優化「申請易」和「電商易」外，我們亦已更針對性資助企業推行綠色轉型項目和列明成立新業務單位的有關專業服務費用為可獲資助項目，協助企業重整供應鏈，以應對貿易戰帶來的挑戰。

我們會繼續與業界密切溝通，不時檢視基金的運作情況，為中小企業作出合適支援，同時顧及基金負擔能力及其財政可持續性。"
LCQ2: BUD Fund,2025-10-15 12:45,2025-10-15 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500372.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Sunny Tan and a reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

 The 2025 Policy Address announced an injection of $1.43 billion into the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales (BUD Fund) and an expansion of its geographical scope. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as some members of the trade have relayed that the simplified application track under the BUD Fund (""Easy BUD"") is very popular among the trade, whether the Government will consider raising the funding ceiling for each ""Easy BUD"" project from $100,000 to $300,000; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether the Government will consider further expanding the application scope of the BUD Fund to cover all markets outside Hong Kong, so as to align with the application scope of the SME Export Marketing Fund which will be consolidated into the BUD Fund next year, thereby better supporting the trade in developing domestic sales, as well as traditional and emerging markets; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) given that the Government's Operating Account is expected to record a surplus in the next financial year, whether the Government will consider adjusting the matching ratio of the BUD Fund to 1:1 of the total approved expenditure between the Government and the enterprises, so as to assist the trade in upgrading their operations; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales (BUD Fund) is one of the initiatives of the Government in supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), aiming at assisting local enterprises in upgrading, transformation and development of diversified markets. From its inception in 2012 to September 2025, nearly 12 000 applications have been approved under the BUD Fund, involving a total funding amount of around $7.5 billion and benefitting around 7 800 enterprises. The Government has since 2018 launched several rounds of enhancements to the BUD Fund, including the injection of a total of $7.7 billion, the expansion of the geographical scope, the phased increase of the cumulative funding ceiling per enterprise from $0.5 million to $7 million, and the launch of ""Easy BUD"" and ""E-commerce Easy"", etc.

 The reply to the three parts of the question by the Hon Sunny Tan is as follows:

(1) ""Easy BUD"" was launched in June 2023 to expedite the processing of applications involving designated measures with a funding amount of $100,000 or below. The application form, requirements for supporting documents and vetting arrangements of ""Easy BUD"" have been streamlined. As compared with the performance pledge for general applications of the BUD Fund, the processing time of an ""Easy BUD"" application has also been significantly reduced by half to within 30 working days.

 As at end-September 2025, a total of 760 applications have been approved under ""Easy BUD"", with an average funding amount of around $72,000. We believe that maintaining the funding ceiling of $100,000 for each application can meet the needs of most enterprises. Besides, to ensure the prudent use of public money, we need to strike a cautious balance between the funding amount and the potential financial risks when determining the funding ceiling of each ""Easy BUD"" application. We consider the current arrangement appropriate.

 In addition, to enable enterprises to receive funding support more expeditiously with a view to coping with the ever-changing economic environment, we have enhanced the arrangement of ""Easy BUD"" since March 2025 to allow each enterprise to submit application once every three months, instead of once every six months in the past. We have also expanded the funding scope to include the establishment of online sales platform.

(2) The current geographical scope of the BUD Fund covers 40 economies with which Hong Kong has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) and/or investment promotion and protection agreements (IPPAs), accounting for around 80 per cent of the total value of Hong Kong's external merchandise trade in 2024. The Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address the further expansion of the geographical scope of the BUD Fund to cover eight more economies, including Belt and Road countries, i.e. expanding the geographical scope by 20 per cent, to assist SMEs in developing more diversified markets. Meanwhile, as the SME Export Marketing Fund will be consolidated into the BUD Fund in July 2026, we will enhance promotion and facilitate enterprises' participation in exhibitions and export marketing activities through ""Easy BUD"".

 Hong Kong is exploring the signing of IPPAs with a number of economies, among which the IPPA negotiation with Qatar has been substantially concluded. Both sides will sign the agreement upon completion of respective internal procedures. The geographical scope of the BUD Fund will be further expanded when Hong Kong signs more FTAs or IPPAs in the future. Since March 2025, we have also expanded the geographical scope of ""E-commerce Easy"" to the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

(3) Over the years, the BUD Fund has been actively supporting SMEs, with several rounds of enhancement measures rolled out. At the same time, demand from enterprises for the Government's funding support has surged significantly in recent years. The number of applications for the BUD Fund in 2024 increased by over 320 per cent as compared with that in 2019, and close to 90 per cent of the subsidies under the BUD Fund were approved in the past six years (2019 to 2024).

 To ensure the financial sustainability of the BUD Fund, the Government introduced measures in March 2025, including the adjustment of the funding ratio of the BUD Fund to 1 (Government): 3 (enterprise), such that enterprises could choose appropriate and cost-effective projects more prudently and be more willing to put in resources. Given that the measure was recently launched in March 2025, we need more time to review its effectiveness, and hence do not have plans to adjust the funding ratio.

 Supporting SMEs is one of the Government's important policies. Therefore, the Government will be injecting more than $3 billion into the BUD Fund in the current and the next financial year. This notwithstanding, we need to be mindful of the financial sustainability of the funding scheme with a view to enabling more enterprises to make use of the funding and maintaining an appropriate spread of beneficiaries. As such, the Government will prudently utilise public funds in a timely and focused manner to cope with the complex and ever-changing economic environment.

 Apart from enhancing ""Easy BUD"" and ""E-commerce Easy"", we have been providing more targeted funding support to enterprises in implementing green transformation projects, and have specified that professional fees associated with the establishment of new business entities are fundable, so as to assist enterprises in restructuring their supply chains in the face of challenges brought about by the trade war.

 We will continue to keep in close touch with the trade and will review the implementation of the BUD Fund from time to time to provide appropriate support to SMEs, while taking into account the financial capacity and sustainability of the BUD Fund."
LCQ19: Upgrading facilities at Kowloon Park,2025-10-15 12:45,2025-10-15 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500321.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Doreen Kong and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

There are views that as one of Hong Kong's major urban parks, Kowloon Park is rich with historical heritage and well located. However, with the changes in time, some facilities in the park have become outdated and underutilised, and the overall development potential has yet to be fully realised. Regarding the upgrading of facilities at Kowloon Park, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the numbers of users and utilisation rates of various major facilities at Kowloon Park (such as the Swimming pool, Sports Centre, Children's Playground, Discovery Playground) in each of the past three years, as well as the results of satisfaction surveys, with a breakdown by type of facility;

(2) as there are views pointing out that Victoria Park, which is a major urban recreational space like Kowloon Park, has become a popular destination for members of the public and visitors due to its frequent hosting of diversified large-scale events, of the comparison of the utilisation of similar facilities between these two parks (such as swimming pool, sports centre/sports venue, children's playground) in the past three years; whether it has specifically analysed the main reasons for the differences in the utilisation rates of facilities at these two parks;

(3) of the regular mechanisms and specific measures put in place by the authorities to regularly inspect, maintain and revamp the facilities at Kowloon Park to ensure that such facilities meet the needs of the public and remain in good condition; whether it has formulated enhancement plans to raise Kowloon Park's attractiveness to locals and visitors (such as improving spatial planning and design in the park, organising more diversified events), thereby increasing the utilisation rates of facilities in the park;

(4) whether the authorities will consider adopting a public-private partnership model for the renovation works of Kowloon Park, allowing the private sector to participate in the design, operation and maintenance of specific areas in the park, so as to alleviate the Government's financial burden and accelerate the revamp of facilities; and

(5) given that the Government announced last year the conversion of Block 58 of the former Whitfield Barracks in Kowloon Park into a Chinese Culture Experience Centre, and the construction of an Annex Block at the nearby Hong Kong Observatory Headquarters, Tsim Sha Tsui to provide facilities including a Public Information and Education Concourse and an exhibition gallery, etc, how the Government integrates the above projects with the existing facilities and activities in Kowloon Park to create a unified space for recreational, cultural and tourism experience; whether it will establish an inter-departmental collaboration mechanism for the above projects and integration efforts to create synergy effects, thereby enhancing visitor flow and public participation in the area?

Reply:

President,

The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) is committed to offering diversified recreation, sports and leisure facilities in the parks under its management, with a view to meeting the public's needs for leisure and recreation activities, advocating healthy lifestyle, and promoting sports to the community. The 13-hectare Kowloon Park is one of the LCSD's major urban parks. It offers a full range of active and passive leisure facilities which are well received by members of the public.

My reply to the questions raised by the Hon Doreen Kong is as follows:

(1) Over the past three years, the usage rates or attendances of the major facilities in Kowloon Park are as follows:




Average usage rate
2022
2023
2024


Sports Centre (Main Arena)
98.3 per cent
96.5per cent
98.2per cent








Attendance
2022
2023
2024


Swimming Pool
521 000
661 000
657 000


Aviary
136 000
168 000
185 000


Bird Lake
266 000
346 000
366 000




The LCSD does not keep relevant information on the attendances of the Children's Playground and the Discovery Playground.

According to a questionnaire survey conducted from July to August 2025, the vast majority (85 per cent) of the respondents were generally ""very satisfied"" or ""satisfied"" with Kowloon Park.

(2) Victoria Park and Kowloon Park are popular major parks featuring active and passive facilities. Similar facilities in both parks include swimming pools and children's playgrounds.

The LCSD does not keep information on the attendances of the children's playgrounds concerned. As for the swimming pools, the attendances of the Kowloon Park Swimming Pool and the Victoria Park Swimming Pool over the past three years are as follows:




Attendance
2022
2023
2024


Kowloon Park Swimming Pool
521 000
661 000
657 000


Victoria Park Swimming Pool
469 000
554 000
540 000




Members of the public choose to go swimming in nearby swimming pools based on their place of residence, place of work and daily schedules etc.ãAs such, the attendance of a swimming pool is subject to a series of factors. Besides, some facilities of the Victoria Park and Kowloon Park are available for organisations to hire for staging events of various scales and types, offering diversified park experiences to visitors as well as providing various organisations with quality venues to hold events. Over the past three years, various organisations hired Kowloon Park for more than 110 times to host events such as carnivals, exhibitions, and competitions (e.g. the Hong Kong International Handball Championships, the Hong Kong Rowing Indoor Championships and Charity Rowathon, an event celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a Tai Chi day, and the opening ceremony of Hong Kong Avenue of Comic Stars phase four). Over the same period, Victoria Park was hired over 40 times for holding events, including multiple major events (e.g. Lunar New Year Fair, Hong Kong Flower Show, Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival, Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon, and Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo).

(3) and (4) To continually enhance public service standards, the LCSD has all along been making plans for regular repair and large-scale improvement of various facilities of Kowloon Park taking into account the views of visitors and works departments with a view to enhancing the park visitors' experience, ensuring that the facilities are safe and comfortable, and providing visitors with an even more attractive leisure space.

In the improvement plan for 2024-25, in addition to carrying out routine repair and maintenance works at Kowloon Park, the LCSD has completed the refurbishment works of Chinese Garden and Children's Playground, as well as the enhancement works of fitness facilities and the Hong Kong Avenue of Comic Stars, bringing a better park experience for visitors. In addition, the LCSD installed specially designed and styled panda displays in the recently completed refurbishment project of the fountain at the Water Garden. Outdoor toilets were also enhanced with the introduction of Kung Fu design element for better visual appeal. As for the improvement plan for 2025-26, it will include projects on renovating toilets of the Discovery Playground as well as beautifying the Aviary and flower plots to further enhance the overall environment of the park, thereby providing visitors with more comfortable leisure space and richer natural landscape.

The LCSD will continue to review the usage of park facilities from time to time and, subject to the availability of resources and suitable venue conditions, formulate and carry out appropriate facility enhancement projects as necessary to continue adding unique features to Kowloon Park and enhancing its attractiveness.

In addition, regarding the public-private partnership, subject to its commercial viability and opportunities, the LCSD will keep an open mind, introduce innovative ideas and actively consider adopting public-private partnership proposals in order to enhance the service quality of facilities, thereby providing members of the public with leisure facilities of higher quality and richer visitor experience.

(5) The LCSD will convert Block 58 of the former Whitfield Barracks in Kowloon Park, with the construction of a new annex, into the Chinese Culture Experience Centre which is aiming at promoting Chinese culture. The Experience Centre will feature a versatile outdoor space harmonised with the natural environment of Kowloon Park, serving as a venue for hosting Chinese culture-related activities while offering citizens and tourists a space that combines cultural elements with natural scenery. The Experience Centre will make good use of technology to offer diversified interactive experiences and object-based learning activities to attract participation of both citizens and tourists."
立法會十二題：尖沙咀東的公眾登岸梯台,2025-10-15 12:33,2025-10-15 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500310.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上易志明議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

政府大力推動旅遊業，而維港遊是其中一個深受旅客歡迎的旅遊活動。然而，據悉現時的維港遊主要集中在尖沙咀東海濱進行，惟該處的公眾登岸梯台數量有限，並出現供不應求的情況。有業界人士更指出有船舶霸佔登岸梯台的泊位，導致其他船舶需等候良久才可靠泊，令爭奪泊位的情況時有發生，甚至出現險象環生的危險場面，引發海上安全隱憂。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）尖沙咀東各公眾登岸梯台在平日、周末及內地長假期期間（尤其是黃昏時段）船舶的使用情況及輪候安排分別為何；

（二）有否統計參加維港遊的旅客資料；如有統計，經旅行團及以散客身份參加的人數分別為何；

（三）當局有何措施善用公共資源，以防止有船舶霸佔位於尖沙咀東的公眾登岸梯台，並維持船舶靠泊及旅客登上經營維港遊的船舶的秩序；及

（四）據悉現時在九龍城碼頭附近接待旅行團的食肆及商店數目已大幅減少，不再出現大量旅客聚集的情況，令現時九龍城景雲街公眾登岸梯級的使用量極低，當局會否考慮在可控的情況下，逐步重啓該公眾登岸梯級的使用，例如首先在平日或周末的指定時間，甚至內地長假期期間開放，以分流部分尖沙咀東海濱的維港遊旅客；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

登岸梯台屬於公眾登岸設施，供船隻上落乘客。就尖沙咀東一帶而言，尖沙咀一號梯台現時由康樂及文化事務署（康文署）管理，其餘二號及五號梯台則由運輸署負責管理及監察其使用量；上述公眾登岸梯台均由土木工程拓展署負責其保養及維修。政府會不時檢視公眾登岸設施的使用情況，並聽取持份者的意見，以改善登岸設施的設計及使用安排。

就易志明議員的提問，經諮詢文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）、運輸署及海事處後，現回覆如下：

（一）運輸署約每兩年對其負責管理的逾190個登岸設施（包括公眾碼頭和登岸梯台）進行使用量調查。就尖沙咀東各公眾登岸梯台進行的二○二三至二○二四年度使用量調查結果見於下表：




登岸設施
登岸設施的一天使用量（註一）（艘船）

周日或公眾假期


尖沙咀一號梯台（註二）
--

0


尖沙咀五號梯台

0




註一：調查在正常天氣的一天由上午七時至下午八時期間進行。
註二：尖沙咀一號梯台現時由康文署管理，該署沒有備存有關梯台的船隻使用量等資料。

根據康文署及旅遊業監管局（旅監局）的觀察，使用尖沙咀一號梯台參與維港遊活動的運作整體暢順，星光大道的排隊秩序大致良好，未有出現混亂。

（二）現時市場提供觀賞維多利亞港景色的海上旅遊項目及觀光船，供市民和旅客參加。參加維港遊的旅客包括旅行團及個人旅客。

旅行團方面，旅監局估算在二○二五年七月至九月期間，共有約16 000個內地入境旅行團（共約57萬人次）的登記行程中包括乘船遊覽維港（包括參加維港遊或乘搭港內線渡輪）。上述內地入境旅行團一般會在尖沙咀、中環、灣仔或北角上落船。當中接近一半會在尖沙咀區上落船，而其中約八成於天星碼頭登船，餘下約兩成使用尖沙咀一號梯台及其他梯台上落船隻。此外，使用尖沙咀一號梯台上落船的遊覽活動一般為自費項目，團員可按意願自由選擇參與，因此實際參與人數會較登記行程的人數少。

文體旅局並沒有備存旅客以散客身份參加維港遊的數字。

（三）船隻靠泊方面，公眾登岸梯台一般屬全日開放的公共設施，任何船隻只需符合有關的海事規例，保障乘客安全上落船隻，便可使用該等設施。根據《商船（本地船隻）（一般）規例》（第548F章），船隻若在公眾登岸梯台停泊，必須是用作上落乘客用途，且在完成上落乘客後，必須離開公眾登岸梯台，以供其他船隻使用。若於部份時段有較多船隻同時等候使用公眾登岸梯台，船隻需有序輪候，方便乘客上落。

海事處每日在香港各區水域（包括尖沙咀東一帶）巡邏執法，當中包括巡視是否有船隻違規佔用公眾登岸梯台，亦會與警務處進行聯合行動，打擊非法載客、超載等違反海事條例的行為。

旅客秩序方面，旅監局一直密切留意內地入境旅行團登記使用尖沙咀一號梯台參與維港遊的情況，並頻繁地派員巡查及監察該處的運作情況，有關維港遊營辦商均有妥善管理乘客排隊上落的秩序。旅監局亦與旅遊業界、地區人士、警方等保持緊密溝通，推動旅行代理商與維港遊營辦商落實協調、調整及分散旅行團行程的措施，以避免同一時間有過多旅行團聚集於同一地點，並加派人手維持秩序。

（四）現時，九龍城區是最多內地入境旅行團聚集的地區之一，有多個全日對外開放的公眾登岸設施供船隻上落乘客，包括提問提及的景雲街公眾登岸梯級。如維港遊營辦商日後有意在現時上落船地點以外，使用維港兩岸其他登岸設施進行內地入境旅行團維港遊上落客活動，旅監局會與相關的業界、地區人士及政府部門等保持溝通，盡力平衡旅行團在該地點的活動為當區居民生活帶來的影響。"
LCQ12: Public landing steps in Tsim Sha Tsui East,2025-10-15 12:33,2025-10-15 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500317.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Frankie Yick and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

  The Government has devoted considerable efforts to promoting tourism, with Victoria Harbour tours being one of the most popular activities among tourists. However, it is learnt that currently Victoria Harbour tours mainly take place along the promenade of Tsim Sha Tsui East, where there is an excessive demand for the limited number of public landing steps. Some industry players have further pointed out that some vessels occupy the berths at the landing steps, forcing other vessels to wait for an extended period of time for berthing. This often leads to competition for berths and even dangerous situations, raising concerns about maritime safety. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective usage and queuing arrangements for the various public landing steps in Tsim Sha Tsui East during weekdays, weekends and Mainland public holidays (particularly during evening hours);

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on visitors joining Victoria Harbour tours; if so, of the respective numbers of those joining through tour groups and as individual travellers;

(3) what measures are in place by the authorities to optimize the use of public resources, prevent vessels from occupying the public landing steps in Tsim Sha Tsui East, and maintain order for berthing of vessels and for passengers boarding the vessels for Victoria Harbour tours; and

(4) as it is learnt that nowadays the number of restaurants and shops near Kowloon City Pier catering to tour groups has significantly dwindled and crowds of tourists no longer exist there, resulting in extremely low usage of the public landing steps at King Wan Street, Kowloon City, whether the authorities will consider gradually reactivating the public landing steps there under controlled circumstances, for example, by first allowing access during specified times on weekdays or weekends, or even during Mainland public holidays, so as to divert some of the visitors of Victoria Harbour tours from the promenade of Tsim Sha Tsui East; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  Landing steps are public landing facilities for use by vessels for passenger embarkation and disembarkation. Regarding the Tsim Sha Tsui East area, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) currently manages Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1, while the Transport Department (TD) is responsible for managing the remaining Landing No.2 and No.5 and monitoring their utilisation. The Civil Engineering and Development Department is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the aforementioned public landing steps. The Government will review the usage of public landing facilities and gauge the views of stakeholders from time to time to improve the design and usage arrangements of the landing facilities.

  In consultation with the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), the TD and the Marine Department (MD), my reply to the question raised by the Hon Frankie Yick is as follows:

(1)The TD conducts utilisation surveys on the over 190 landing facilities (including public piers and landing steps) under its management about every two years. Survey findings on the utilisation of public landing steps in Tsim Sha Tsui East in year 2023-2024 are shown in the following table:




Landing facility
Daily utilisation of the facility (Note1)
			(No. of vessels)


Weekdays or Saturdays
Sundays or public holidays


Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1 (Note2)
--
--


Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.2
0
0


Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.5
0
0




Note1: The surveys were conducted between 7am and 8pm on a normal weather day.
Note2: Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1 is currently managed by LCSD, which does not keep information such as its utilisation by vessels.

  According to the observations of the LCSD and the Travel Industry Authority (TIA), participation in Victoria Harbour tours using Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1 has been running smoothly as a whole. The queuing order at the Avenue of Stars is generally good, with no signs of chaos.

(2)At present, marine tourism projects and sightseeing vessels are available in the market for the general public and tourists to enjoy the scenery of the Victoria Harbour. Participants of the Victoria Harbour tours include both tour groups and individual travellers.

  In respect of tour groups, the TIA estimated that between July and September 2025, there were around 16 000 Mainland inbound tour groups (with around 570 000 visitors in total) registered with itineraries including taking vessels to tour the Victoria Harbour (including joining Victoria Harbour tours or taking inner harbour ferry routes). The aforementioned Mainland inbound tour groups generally embark and disembark in Tsim Sha Tsui, Central, Wan Chai or North Point. Nearly half of these groups will embark and disembark in the Tsim Sha Tsui area, among which around 80 per cent will embark at the Star Ferry Pier, while the remaining around 20 per cent will use Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1 and other landing steps for embarkation and disembarkation. In addition, tour activities using Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1 for embarkation and disembarkation are generally self-paid activities, which tour group members could freely choose to participate according to their preference, hence the actual number of participants may be lower than that registered with the itineraries.

  The CSTB does not keep figures on the number of tourists who participated in Victoria Harbour tours in the capacity of individual travellers.

(3)In terms of berthing by vessels, public landing steps are generally public facilities that are open all day and for use by all vessels provided that they comply with the relevant marine regulations to ensure safe embarkation and disembarkation of passengers. Under the Merchant Shipping (Local Vessels) (General) Regulation (Cap.548F), the purpose of berthing at public landing steps should be to enable embarkation and disembarkation of passengers on or from a vessel only. Upon completion of which, the vessel concerned must leave the public landing steps to allow berthing by other vessels. During periods of high demand for the public landing steps, vessels are required to queue up in an orderly manner so as to facilitate passenger embarkation and disembarkation.

  The MD conducts daily patrols and law enforcement in various Hong Kong waters (including the Tsim Sha Tsui East area), including against unauthorised occupation of the public landing steps by vessels. The MD also conducts joint operations with the Police to combat conducts in violation of marine legislations such as illegal carriage of passengers and overloading.

  In terms of order of the tourists, the TIA has been closely monitoring the situation of registered Mainland inbound tour groups using Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No. 1 to participate in Victoria Harbour tours, and frequently deploying staff to monitor and inspect the operating situation on site. The Victoria Harbour operators concerned have been properly managing the order of passengers queuing for embarkation and disembarkation. The TIA also maintains close communication with members of the travel trade, districts, the Police, etc, to facilitate measures to be implemented by travel agents and Victoria Harbour tour operators to co-ordinate, adjust and stagger the itineraries of tour groups, as well as deploy additional manpower to maintain order, with a view to avoiding excessive concentration of tour groups at the same location at the same time.

(4)Kowloon City is currently one of the districts gathered with the largest number of Mainland inbound tour groups. There are multiple public landing facilities that are open all day for use by vessels for passenger embarkation and disembarkation, including the King Wan Street Landing mentioned in the question. If Victoria Harbour tour operators intend to use landing facilities along both sides of the Victoria Harbour other than the current embarkation and disembarkation points for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers from Mainland inbound tour groups participating in Victoria Harbour tours, the TIA will maintain close liaison with relevant members of the trade, districts, Government departments, etc, striving to balance the impact of tour group activities on the local communities at the locations concerned."
立法會十三題：推動人工智能發展,2025-10-15 12:22,2025-10-15 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500256.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上黃錦輝議員的提問和創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見指出，人工智能（AI）發展一日千里，多個國家（例如新加坡及韓國）均為AI制訂發展策略。今年《施政報告》亦提出多項推動AI發展及應用措施；而本年八月國務院也發布了《關於深入實施「人工智能+」行動的意見》（《意見》），確立了分階段目標，包括到二○二七年實現AI與六大重點領域深度融合、在二○三○年前推動AI全面賦能高質量發展，以及到二○三五年全面步入智能經濟和智能社會發展新階段。此外，《意見》亦提出加快實施六大重點行動，包括「人工智能+」的科學技術、產業發展、消費提質、民生福祉、治理能力和全球合作。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否參考其他國家及地區的做法，全面檢視香港推動AI發展情況和制訂未來發展策略；

（二）會否參考《意見》確立的目標和重點行動，為香港推展「人工智能+」的行動訂立分階段的目標；

（三）會否制訂政策措施，不單為個別企業提供支援，也主動推動各個行業應用AI技術，從而提升本港各行業的整體競爭力；及

（四）有否檢視現時培育AI人才的工作是否足夠應對未來需求，以及有否就本港AI的發展制訂人才培訓目標？

答覆：

主席：

就黃錦輝議員的提問，經諮詢相關決策局，我現綜合回覆如下：

人工智能（AI）正引領新一輪科技革命和產業變革。世界各主要經濟體均會立足自身優勢，制定符合其發展需要的AI策略及目標。綜觀全球AI發展格局、各國的戰略部署，包括國家於去年提出的「人工智能+」行動及今年八月發布的《關於深入實施「人工智能+」行動的意見》，均聚焦於科研創新、算力基建、數據供應及人才培育等關鍵領域，旨在推動AI與經濟社會各行業及領域的深度融合和應用創新。

就香港而言，自《香港創新科技發展藍圖》提出重點發展AI的策略方針以來，政府已為本港AI發展訂立清晰目標，並以「加強基建，推動應用導向」為重心，針對不同關鍵領域（包括科研、基礎設施、數據、產業應用、人才培訓等）穩步推進多項措施。本港多維度的AI政策及具體措施不但與國家的「人工智能+」行動一脈相承，亦與全球AI發展路徑高度契合。我們亦會適時檢視落實情況及按最新發展需要優化個別政策及支援措施，讓AI賦能高質量發展。

在科研創新方面，政府透過「AIR@InnoHK」研發平台，資助成立了16間專注於AI及機械人科技的研發實驗室，匯聚了過千名科研專才，強化本港的AI基礎研究能力。

我們亦剛剛獲立法會批准撥款10億元，以期於二○二六年成立香港人工智能研發院，促進AI上游研發、中下游成果轉化及開拓應用場景。

在算力基建方面，數碼港人工智能超算中心將於今年年底進一步提升算力水平，以支持本地的算力需求。為支援本地院校、研發機構和企業充分利用超算中心的算力，我們已推出30億元的人工智能資助計劃，以支撐大規模AI科研和應用，計劃至今已成功批出十多個重點項目。

此外，我們剛剛推出位於北區沙嶺的數據園區發展用地進行市場公開招標，以提供先進算力設施，進一步推動數據及AI相關產業發展。

在數據供應方面，政府積極推行開放數據政策，並鼓勵公私營機構開放更多高質量數據，為本港AI發展提供關鍵要素。現時，「開放數據平台」已匯聚超過5 600個數據集，涵蓋財經、教育、運輸、社區及社會福利、法律及保安等不同行業和界別，為業界訓練算法和開發大模型提供重要支撐。

至於跨境數據方面，數字政策辦公室在《促進粵港澳大灣區數據跨境流動的合作備忘錄》的基礎上推出了標準合同便利措施，促進數據安全有序跨境流動。我們會繼續積極探討早日實現內地數據合規安全流動到河套香港園區用於科研，助力AI應用測試與創新。

LCQ13: Promoting development of artificial intelligence,2025-10-15 12:22,2025-10-15 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500264.htm,"  Following is a question by Professor the Hon William Wong and a written reply by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

There are views pointing out that artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing at a rapid pace and a number of countries such as Singapore and South Korea have formulated their AI development strategies. In parallel, this year's Policy Address has proposed various initiatives to promote the development and application of AI. The State Council also issued in August this year the Opinions on Further Implementing the ""Artificial Intelligence Plus"" Action (the Opinions) setting out phased objectives including realisation of extensive and in-depth integration of AI with six key areas by 2027, full AI empowerment for highâquality development by 2030, and full entry into a new stage of intelligent economic and societal development by 2035. Furthermore, the Opinions propose accelerating the implementation of six key actions, including Artificial Intelligence Plus in scientific and technology, industrial development, consumption upgrades, people's livelihoods and well-being, governance capacity, and global cooperation. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will, by drawing on the practices of other countries and regions, comprehensively review the promotion of AI development in Hong Kong and map out future strategies;

(2) whether it will establish a phased target for Hong Kong to take forward the ""Artificial Intelligence Plus"" action by drawing reference from the objectives and key actions set out in the Opinions;

(3) whether it will formulate policy initiatives to, apart from providing support to individual enterprises, proactively promote the application of AI technology in various industries, thereby enhancing the overall competitiveness of various industries in Hong Kong; and

(4) whether it has reviewed if existing efforts to nurture AI talent are adequate to meet future demand, and whether targets have been set for manpower training in relation to the development of AI in Hong Kong?

Reply:

President,

Having consulted the relevant bureaux, my consolidated reply to the questions raised by Professor the Hon William Wong is as follows:

  AI is leading a new round of scientific and technological revolution, as well as industry transformation. Major economies around the world are leveraging their unique strengths to formulate AI strategies and objectives that align with their development needs. We can see that the global AI development landscape and the strategic deployments of various countries, including the ""AI+"" initiative proposed by our nation last year, as well as the Opinions on Deepening the Implementation of the ""AI Plus"" Initiative released in August this year, focus on key areas such as scientific research innovation, computing infrastructure, data supply, and talent cultivation. These efforts aim to promote the deep integration and application innovation of AI across various industries and sectors of the economy and society.

For Hong Kong, since the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint (the Blueprint) put forth a strategic focus on the development of AI, the Government has set out clear goals for the development of AI, with a focus on ""strengthening infrastructure and promoting the application-oriented approach"". Steady progress has been made in various key areas, including research, infrastructure, data, industry applications, and talent nurturing. The multi-dimensional AI policies and specific measures in Hong Kong are not only in line with the national ""AI+"" initiative but also highly coherent with the global development path of AI. We will also timely review the implementation status and optimise individual policies and support measures according to the latest development needs, to enable AI to empower high-quality development.

In terms of innovative research and development (R&D), the Government has funded the establishment of 16 R&D laboratories focusing on AI and robotic technologies through the AIR@InnoHK research cluster, pooling over a thousand experts and strengthening Hong Kong's capabilities in foundational AI research.

We have just obtained funding approval of $1 billion from the Legislative Council for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute (AIRDI) in 2026, which will facilitate upstream AI R&D, midstream and downstream transformation of R&D outcomes, as well as expansion of application scenarios.

Regarding computing infrastructure, Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre (AISC) will further uplift its computing power within this year to meet the local demand of computing power. To support local institutions, R&D institutes and enterprises in fully utilising the computing power of the AISC, we have launched the $3 billion AI Subsidy Scheme to support large-scale AI scientific research and applications. To date, it has successfully approved more than ten major projects.

In addition, we have just put up for tender a site at Sandy Ridge in the North District for the development of a data facility cluster. It will provide advanced computing power facilities, promoting the development of data and AI-related industries.

In terms of data supply, the Government has been actively implementing the open data policy and encouraging public and private organisations to open up more high-quality data, with a view to providing essential elements for the development of AI in Hong Kong. Currently, the Open Data Portal has published over 5 600 datasets, covering various industries and sectors including finance, education, transportation, community and social welfare, law and security, etc., providing important support for the industries in training algorithms and developing large language models.

Regarding cross-boundary data, the Digital Policy Office introduced the Standard Contract facilitation measure based on the Memorandum of Understanding on Facilitating Cross-boundary Data Flow within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to facilitate the safe and orderly cross-boundary flow of data. We will also actively explore the early establishment of a compliant and secure mechanism for cross-boundary flow of Mainland data to the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Co-operation Zone for scientific research purposes, supporting AI application testing and innovation.

To assist various industries in fully seizing the opportunities brought by AI, the 2025 Policy Address proposed the enhancement of Cyberport's Digital Transformation Support Pilot Programme to empower small and medium enterprises to apply AI solutions through matching resources. The AIRDI will also provide professional advice and recommendations to address the difficulties and pain points encountered by different industries or enterprises in the application of AI. This will assist the industry in effectively matching AI solutions that meet their business needs, extensively expanding AI application scenarios in industries, and enhancing industry competitiveness, thereby facilitating ""industries for AI"" and ""AI for industries"".

Talent is vital in the global AI race. Following the development strategy and goal of enriching innovation and technology (I&T) talent resources and developing an international talent hub outlined in the Blueprint, we have been fully advancing various initiatives to attract overseas AI talent and nurture local AI talent. In particular, we have launched the $3 billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme in September this year to support Universities Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities to attract international top-notch scientific researchers in AI and other fields to Hong Kong to spearhead basic research in frontier technologies. The key initiatives for nurturing local AI talent are as follows:

(i) In terms of secondary and primary schools, the Government has set aside $2 billion in the Quality Education Fund to support the implementation of digital education and will formulate the Blueprint for Digital Education, including optimising the interface between primary and secondary curricula of Information Technology and I&T education, and setting out an ""AI literacy"" learning framework; collaborate with professional bodies to roll out pilot schemes on AI education and enhance AI-related training for teachers; and launch progressively digital platforms and tools equipped with AI under the e-Learning Ancillary Facilities Programme for schools;

(ii) With the support of the Government, the Vocational Training Council established the Hong Kong Institute of Information Technology in 2023, which offered a number of AI-related training programmes such as the Higher Diploma in AI and Smart Technology, the Higher Diploma in Data Science and AI, the Higher Diploma in Applied AI, etc.;

(iii) The UGC encourages universities to offer more programmes related to STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics) and the ""eight centres"" (including international I&T centre) under the National 14th Five-Year Plan. Currently, several universities have offered AI-related UGC-funded undergraduate programmes; and

(iv) Provide internship opportunities in the I&T sector for university students enrolled in STEM (Science, Technology, engineering and mathematics) related programmes through the STEM Internship Scheme."
LCQ14: Ensuring local workers' employment priority and labour rights,2025-10-15 12:18,2025-10-15 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500252.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Tang Fei and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

 Various sectors in the community have all along been concerned about the impact of labour importation policy on local workers' employment opportunities and labour rights, and the Supplement to the 2025 Policy Address also states that the Government will announce the findings of the review of the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme in the second quarter of 2026, including measures to safeguard employment priority for local workers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the monthly number of applications received and approved under various labour importation schemes since 2023, with a breakdown by (i) type of industry of the applicant companies (based on the industry section defined by the Census and Statistics Department for labour statistics), (ii) classification of occupations, and (iii) the number of imported workers involved in each application (e.g. One to 10 persons, 11 to 20 persons, etc);

(2) as there are views pointing out that the Labour Department (LD) has closed three job centres since April last year, which has significantly reduced the network of job centres and industry-based recruitment centres and made it difficult for some local job seekers to obtain immediate and comprehensive employment support services, prompting the chances of getting on-the-spot interviews by attending job fairs to reduce correspondingly, of the reasons for making such arrangements; given that unemployment rate in Hong Kong has rebounded since the beginning of this year, and the increase was particularly notable in some industries such as construction, and on the other hand some companies have continuously applied for labour importation, indicating that there is considerable needs for employment and recruitment in Hong Kong, whether the LD will consider reinstating the number of job centres and industry-based recruitment centres (or at least maintaining the current number) and appropriately increasing the number of job fairs to enhance support for local workers in job-seeking;

(3) of the respective number of service users of LD's job centres and industry-based recruitment centres in each year since 2023, the number of job fairs organised, the number of attendances and employers participating in the job fairs, the average number of interviews offered in each job fair, and the respective rates of change of such numbers in each year;

(4) as it is learnt that apart from the explicit requirement for applicant companies to arrange recruitment days under the Labour Importation Scheme for the Construction Sector and the requirement for employers of the catering industry to organise job fairs at the LD's job centres when importing workers for designated posts, there is no such mandatory requirements for other labour importation schemes/industries, of the reasons for that;

(5) whether it has considered requiring all employers applying for labour importation (regardless of industry, job category and number of workers applied for) to arrange recruitment days and register available jobs at the LD's job centres and industry-based recruitment centres so as to facilitate local job seekers to apply for such vacancies and ensure fairness and sincerity in the local recruitment process, thereby eliminating ""bogus recruitment"";

(6) of the number of complaints received by the authorities regarding the displacement of local workers with imported workers in each year since 2023 and the industries involved; of the progress and findings of the investigations into such complaints; of the authorities' measures in place to further prevent employers from displacing local workers with imported workers; and

(7) given that intermediaries/organisations (including unlicensed employment agencies) in the market have claimed to assist local companies in applying for labour importation subject to a charge, whether the authorities have plans for regulation in this regard to protect the rights of local workers, imported workers and applicant employers?

Reply:

President,

 To cope with the challenges brought by manpower shortage and foster Hong Kong's economic development, the Government, on the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, suitably allows employers with genuine difficulty in recruiting suitable local workers to apply for importation of workers. On June 19, 2023, the Labour and Welfare Bureau introduced the Special Scheme to Import Care Workers for Residential Care Homes for the residential care home sector. On July 17, 2023, the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB) respectively launched sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction and transport sectors (including the aviation industry and the public light bus/coach trade). In addition, the Labour Department (LD) has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023, allowing employers with genuine needs to apply for importation of workers for posts that were generally excluded under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme (including the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts).

 In consultation with the DEVB and the TLB, the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) As at September 2025, the numbers of applications received and approved under various labour importation schemes are at Annex 1. A breakdown of the numbers of applications received and approved by industry under the ESLS is at Annex 2. The Government does not maintain breakdowns of the numbers of applications received and approved by post and number of imported workers involved in each application.

(2) and (3) The LD provides diversified and free employment services to job seekers through its job centres and industry-based recruitment centres. In addition, LD's Interactive Employment Service website (iES) and mobile application offer round-the-clock online employment services and employment information. Job seekers can also call the job seeker hotline of the Telephone Employment Service Centre (TESC) of the LD to obtain employment services.

 In view of the increasing popularity of online employment services among the general public and to utilise public resources more effectively, the LD has adjusted and enhanced its employment services since April 2024, including extending the daily service hours of job centres and industry-based recruitment centres, introducing voicemail service of the TESC outside office hours, merging certain job centres and redeploying manpower resources, to provide more costâeffective services to members of the public.

 From 2023 to September 2025, the numbers of visitors, job fairs held, participating employers, on-the-spot interviews arranged and the average number of interviews per job fair recorded by job centres and industry-based recruitment centres each year are at Annex 3. The data indicates that from 2024 onwards, job centres and industry-based recruitment centres have recorded increases in the numbers of annual visitors and on-the-spot interviews as well as the average number of interviews per job fair. In tandem, the numbers of page views and usage counts for the iES website and mobile application also recorded year-on-year increases, indicating that the job centres and online employment services continue to provide optimal services to job seekers after redeploying the resources.

 The LD will continue to closely monitor changes in the employment market, review the services provided in a timely manner, and make adjustments and enhancements to services in light of the service needs and market situation.
     
(4) and (5) The requirements and implementation arrangements of various labour importation schemes ensure the employment priority for local workers. Relevant measures include employers applying for importation of labour must first undertake local open recruitment according to the requirements of relevant schemes at a salary not lower than the median monthly wage of a comparable position in the market and accord priority to employing qualified local workers to fill the job vacancies. Employers must also sign a Standard Employment Contract with imported workers, and shall pay a salary not lower than the median monthly wage of a comparable position to prevent the imported workers from becoming ""cheap labour"" and undermining the employment opportunities of local workers. Besides, employers applying for importation of labour should meet the manning ratio requirement of local employees to imported workers.

 For the ESLS, employers shall adopt the recruitment terms agreed by the LD and undergo local recruitment for the applied posts. During the recruitment period, the LD will publish the job vacancies on iES, conduct job matching for relevant vacancies and disseminate the vacancy information to members of the Labour Advisory Board, relevant trade unions and training institutions to facilitate their referral of suitable local job seekers for application. Upon completion of the local recruitment procedures, employers shall report the results to the LD. If an employer is unsuccessful in employing suitable candidate(s), the LD will contact each local job seeker who is not employed to verify the interview details. If there is evidence showing that an employer has violated the requirements of local recruitment or refused to employ qualified local job seekers without reasonable grounds, the LD will terminate the processing of the relevant application. The LD will also impose administrative sanction on the employer and refuse to process any other application(s) submitted by the concerned employer, with a debarment period up to two years.

 The 2025 Policy Address announced that, with effect fromSeptember 18, 2025, the local recruitment period of employers applying for importing waiters/waitresses and junior cooks will be extended from four weeks to six weeks, during which an employer must attend an on-site job fair once a week at a job centre assigned by the LD. This measure takes into account changes in the labour market of individual industries and focuses on job categories with more imported workers. The Government will continue to closely monitor changes in the employment situation and adopt a flexible approach to adjust the implementation arrangements, striving to ensure the priority for local employment.

(6) Employers approved to import workers shall not displace serving local employees with imported workers. In the event of redundancy, imported workers should be retrenched first. The LD has implemented new measures since June 2025, including launching an online complaint form on the ESLS dedicated webpage to enable local employees and imported workers to lodge complaints against employers over suspected breaches of the ESLS requirements. In addition, Labour Inspectors of the LD conduct inspections of workplaces of imported workers from time to time to verify whether employers are complying with the ESLS requirements. If an employer has violated relevant requirements, the LD will impose administrative sanction on that employer, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of labour previously granted to the employer and refusal to process other subsequent applications for labour importation in the following two years.

 Since the implementation of the ESLS on September 4, 2023, the LD received one, 19 and 321 complaints in 2023 (from September 4 to December 31), 2024 and 2025 (as at September 30) respectively alleging that employers had displaced serving local employees with imported workers. These complaints mainly involved food and beverage services, manufacturing and cleaning services. The LD has launched investigations into all complaints received, including conducting inspections and evidence-gathering at the workplaces of imported workers, verifying with employers and employees in detail whether the numbers of local staff had decreased after the arrival of imported workers, the reasons for the decrease and whether the employers had undertaken local recruitment to fill the vacancies left by the departing local workers.

 Of the above complaints received, the LD completed the investigation of 68 cases, of which 67 did not have sufficient evidence to establish that the employers had violated the ESLS requirements, while the remaining cases are still under investigation. In one of the cases where a violation was found, the LD announced on August 29, 2025 the imposition of administrative sanction on that employer, and withdrew the approvals for importation of labour previously granted and refused to process its subsequent applications for labour importation in the following two years.

(7) Any person or institution who operates a business in Hong Kong for the purpose of obtaining employment for another person or supplying the labour of another person to an employer is regarded as an employment agency (EA) and is subject to regulation under the Employment Ordinance, the Employment Agency Regulations and the Code of Practice for Employment Agencies. All EAs operating in Hong Kong, regardless of their mode of operation or categories of jobs offered (including those involving imported workers), must first obtain an EA licence issued by the LD before commencing operation. If any person or institution is found operating an EA without a valid licence, the LD will conduct investigations seriously and take enforcement actions, and instigate prosecution where there is sufficient evidence to substantiate an offence. The LD also reminds the public on the dedicated webpage of the ESLS to stay vigilant towards advertisements or messages claiming to provide servicesfor recruiting Mainland workers and to ascertain the capability of an enterprise to operate the business to avoid being deceived or misled, which may result in financial loss or delay in the processing of applications.

 Besides, to strengthen the protection for Mainland workers, the Government requires employers who are granted approval-in-principle/quotas to import workers under various labour importation schemes and intend to import workers from the Mainland must recruit the workers through enterprises which have been approved by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China and granted the permission to operate business on labour service co-operation with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Government has implemented a monitoring mechanism that requires employers to submit designated documents containing information about the relevant approved labour service enterprises when applying for entry permits for the Mainland workers with the Immigration Department (ImmD). Otherwise, the ImmD will not process relevant applications."
立法會十四題：確保本地勞工優先就業及勞工權益,2025-10-15 12:18,2025-10-15 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500234.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上鄧飛議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

社會各界一直關注輸入勞工政策對本地勞工就業機會及勞工權益的影響，而二○二五年《施政報告》的附篇亦表示政府會在二○二六年第二季公布檢討「補充勞工優化計劃」的結果，當中包括保障本地勞工優先就業的措施。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）自二○二三年至今，每月各項輸入勞工計劃的申請及獲批宗數為何，並按（i）申請公司的行業分類（依據政府統計處就勞工統計所劃分的行業主類）和（ii）職業分類，以及（iii）‍每宗申請所涉及的輸入勞工人數（例如一人至10人、11人至20人等）列出分項數字；

（二）鑑於有意見指出，勞工處自去年四月起先後關閉三所就業中心，顯著縮減就業中心及行業性招聘中心網絡，令部分本地求職者難以取得即時及全面的就業支援服務，而參加招聘會以獲得即場面試的機會亦相應減少，政府作出有關安排的原因為何；鑑於本港失業率自今年初起有回升趨勢，部分行業（例如建造業）的失業率升幅尤其顯著，但另一方面卻不斷有公司申請輸入勞工，反映本港仍存在一定的就業及招聘需求，勞工處會否考慮回復就業中心及行業性招聘中心的數目（或最低限度維持現有數目），並適度增加招聘會數目，以加強協助本地勞工求職；

（三）自二○二三年至今，每年勞工處就業中心及行業性招聘中心的服務人次、舉辦招聘會數目、參加招聘會的人次及僱主數目、每場招聘會提供的面試平均數目，以及每年該等數據的增減幅度分別為何；

（四）據悉除了建造業輸入勞工計劃明確規定申請公司必須舉辦招聘日，以及飲食業僱主在輸入指定職位時必須在勞工處的就業中心舉行招聘會外，其他輸入勞工計劃／行業並無相關硬性要求，原因為何；

（五）有否考慮要求所有申請輸入勞工的僱主（不論行業、工種及申請輸入勞工數目）必須在勞工處就業中心及行業性招聘中心舉辦招聘日及登記招聘職位，以便利本地求職者申請有關空缺，並確保有關的本地招聘過程公正及真誠，從而杜絕「假招聘」的情況；

（六）自二○二三年至今，每年當局收到多少宗有關以輸入勞工取代本地工人的投訴，當中涉及的行業為何；該等投訴的調查進度及結果為何；當局有何措施進一步防止僱主以輸入勞工取代本地工人；及

（七）鑑於市場上有中介公司／機構（包括非持牌職業介紹所）聲稱可收費協助本地公司申請輸入勞工，當局有否計劃就此作出規管，以保障本地工人、輸入勞工及申請僱主的權益？

答覆：

主席：

為應對人力短缺帶來的挑戰，政府在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，適度容許僱主確實未能在本地聘得合適人手時申請輸入勞工，推動香港的經濟發展。勞工及福利局於二○二三年六月十九日為院舍服務業推出「院舍輸入護理員特別計劃」，發展局和運輸及物流局於二○二三年七月十七日分別為建造業和運輸業（包括航空業及公共小巴／客車行業）推出行業輸入勞工計劃。此外，勞工處自二○二三年九月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），容許有實際需要的僱主申請輸入原有「補充勞工計劃」下一般不得輸入（包括26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位）的勞工。

就議員的提問，經諮詢發展局和運輸及物流局後，現答覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年九月，上述各輸入勞工計劃的申請和獲批宗數載於附件一；優化計劃下申請和獲批宗數按行業劃分的分項數字載於附件二。政府沒有備存每宗申請及獲批並按職業分類及涉及輸入勞工人數劃分的分項統計數字。

（二）及（三）勞工處的就業中心及行業性招聘中心，為求職人士提供多元化及免費的就業服務。此外，勞工處的「互動就業服務」網站及流動應用程式，為求職人士提供24小時網上就業服務和就業資訊。求職人士亦可利用電話就業服務中心的求職人士熱線獲取就業服務。

鑑於現時市民使用網上就業服務的情況日趨普及，為更有效運用公共資源，勞工處於二○二四年四月起調整及優化其就業服務，包括延長就業中心和行業性招聘中心的每日服務時間；電話就業服務中心於辦公時間外增設電話留言服務；以及合併部分就業中心，重新配置人力資源，為市民提供更具成本效益的服務。

二○二三年至二○二五年九月，就業中心及行業性招聘中心每年到訪人數、舉行招聘會數目、參與僱主數目、安排即場面試數目及每場招聘會平均面試數目的統計數字載於附件三。數據顯示，二○二四年起就業中心及行業性招聘中心的每年到訪人數、即場面試數目及每場招聘會平均安排的面試數目均錄得增長。與此同時，勞工處「互動就業服務」網站及流動應用程式錄得的瀏覽和使用次數亦按年遞升，顯示就業中心與網上服務的資源重新配置能繼續為求職者提供適切的服務。

勞工處會繼續密切監察就業市場的變化，適時檢視各項服務，並因應服務需求及市場情況調整及優化服務。

（四）及（五）各輸入勞工計劃的規定和執行安排均確保本地工人優先就業。有關措施包括申請輸入勞工的僱主必須先以不低於市場相類職位的每月工資中位數按有關計劃的規定進行本地公開招聘，優先聘請合資格的本地工人填補空缺。僱主亦必須與輸入勞工簽訂標準僱傭合約，並支付不低於相類職位中位工資的薪金，防止輸入勞工成為廉價勞工，損害本地工人的就業機會。此外，申請輸入勞工的僱主必須符合本地僱員與輸入勞工的人手比例規定。

就優化計劃而言，僱主須以勞工處同意的招聘條件就申請職位進行本地招聘，其間勞工處會在「互動就業服務」網站刊登職位空缺資料，為有關空缺進行就業選配，並將空缺資料發布給勞工顧問委員會委員、相關職工會及培訓機構，以便他們轉介合適的本地求職人士應徵。僱主完成本地招聘程序後，須向勞工處匯報結果，如僱主未能成功招聘合適人選，勞工處會聯繫每名不獲聘用的本地求職者，了解面試詳情。如有證據顯示僱主違反本地招聘的規定，或無合理理由拒絕聘用合資格的本地求職者，勞工處會中止處理有關申請。勞工處亦會向僱主施加行政制裁，拒絕處理他們提交的其他申請，禁制期可達兩年。

二○二五年《施政報告》宣布，由二○二五年九月十八日起，經優化計劃申請輸入侍應生及初級廚師時，僱主須進行的本地招聘由四星期延長至六星期，並須每周參加一次勞工處指定的在就業中心舉行的招聘會。這措施顧及個別行業勞動力市場的變化並聚焦於輸入勞工較多的指定工種。政府會繼續動態監察就業情況，靈活調整實施安排，致力確保本地就業優先。

（六）獲批准輸入勞工的僱主不得以輸入勞工取代在職本地僱員。如需裁員，僱主應先裁減輸入勞工。勞工處自二○二五年六月起實施新措施，包括在優化計劃專題網頁新增網上投訴表格，方便本地僱員及輸入勞工就僱主涉嫌違反優化計劃的規定作出投訴。此外，勞工處的勞工督察不時巡查輸入勞工的工作地點，查核僱主有否遵守優化計劃的規定。僱主如違反相關規定，勞工處會對有關僱主作出行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准及拒絕處理其隨後兩年提交的輸入勞工申請。

勞工處自二○二三年九月四日推行優化計劃以來，於二○二三年（九月四‍日至十二月三十一日）、二○二四年及二○二五年（截至九月三十日）分別接獲一宗、19宗及321宗懷疑僱主以輸入勞工取代在職本地僱員的投訴。有關投訴主要涉及餐飲服務業、製造業及清潔服務業。勞工處已就所有收到的投訴展開調查，包括到輸入勞工的工作地點進行巡查及搜證，並向僱主及僱員詳細查證在輸入勞工到職後本地員工的數目有否減少、減少的原因及僱主有否進行本地招聘填補已離職的本地僱員。

上述接獲的投訴中，勞工處已完成調查68宗個案，其中67宗沒有足夠證據確立僱主違反優化計劃的規定，而其他投訴個案仍在調查中。就一宗違反規定的個案，勞工處於二○二五年八月二十九日公布，向該名僱主施加行政制裁，撤銷該僱主就優化計劃已獲發的輸入勞工原則性批准及拒絕處理其隨後兩年提交的輸入勞工申請。

（七）任何人士或機構，如在香港經營為他人覓取職位或向僱主提供員工為目的的業務，均屬經營職業介紹所，並受《僱傭條例》、《職業介紹所規例》及《職業介紹所實務守則》規管。不論經營模式或所介紹的職務類別（包括輸入勞工），所有在香港經營的職業介紹所必須事先領有勞工處發出的牌照。如發現有任何人士或機構在本港無牌經營職業介紹所，勞工處會嚴肅調查及採取執法行動，並在有足夠證據時提出檢控。勞工處亦在優化計劃的專題網頁提醒市民對聲稱提供招聘內地勞工服務的廣告或信息提高警覺，必須核實相關企業或香港職業介紹所的經營資格，以免受騙或被誤導，導致金錢損失或申請延誤。

此外，政府規定根據各輸入勞工計劃獲原則性批准／配額的僱主如擬從內地輸入勞工，必須由獲國家商務部批准並取得對香港特別行政區勞務合作經營資格的勞務企業進行招聘，加強對內地勞工的保障。政府已推行監管機制，規定僱主向入境事務處（入境處）申請內地輸港勞工的進入許可時，必須提交載有相關核准勞務企業資料的指定文件，否則入境處不會處理有關申請。"
立法會十六題：便利表演團體來港的措施,2025-10-15 12:10,2025-10-15 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500268.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上陳恒鑌議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

政府宣布於今年二月二十六日起，就各項人才與資本投資者的入境計劃（指明入境計劃）增設申請費600元，並將簽證／入境證的簽發費分別上調至600元（逗留期限180日或以下）及1,300元（逗留期限181日或以上）。有意見反映，上述簽證收費對由其他地區來港並靠捐款維持營運的表演團體（例如在盂蘭勝會表演的神功戲戲班）造成沉重的財政壓力，影響傳統文化的傳承及交流。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年經指明入境計劃獲批來港的中國內地民間傳統表演團體（包括神功戲戲班）數目及所涉及的人員為何（以表列出）；

（二）據悉不少地區團體在慶典活動時均會邀請中國內地的表演團體來港演出，以促進文化交流，政府會否考慮對該等沒有向公眾收取演出費用的表演團體人員豁免簽證申請費及簽發費，或推行分級收費制度，以鼓勵民間的文化交流及促進文化遺產傳承；

（三）自「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（短期訪客計劃）於二○二四年恆常化以來，透過該計劃獲准在以訪客身分逗留期間，參與文化藝術界別指定短期活動的中國內地表演團體數目為何；及

（四）鑑於有意見指出，地區團體對民間傳統表演團體表演的需求甚殷，但表演團體透過短期訪客計劃來港須獲得認可主辦機構（例如文化體育及旅遊局）以邀請信的方式作出認可，過程上存在一定難度，政府會否考慮進一步簡化相關申請程序，以令更多表演團體可在無須申請工作簽證的情況下來港交流？

答覆：

主席：

就陳恒鑌議員的提問，經諮詢保安局、勞工及福利局及入境事務處（入境處）後，現回覆如下：

（一）具備香港所需且缺乏的特別技能、知識或經驗的內地居民，可在符合條件的情況下透過「輸入內地人才計劃」（提問所指的「指明入境計劃」）申請來港工作，包括短期或一次性項目為本的工作。二○二二年、二○二三年及二○二四年間，「輸入內地人才計劃」下的獲批申請中，涉及「藝術／文化界別」內地人才的獲批申請數目分別為285宗、2 496宗及4 618宗。入境處並無備存當中涉及內地民間傳統表演團體（包括神功戲戲班）的分項統計數字。

（二）至（四）政府在制訂「輸入內地人才計劃」的收費水平時已平衡各方面的考慮因素。其中，考慮到部分申請涉及短期／一次性項目的工作，政府實施兩級制簽發費，逗留期限為180日或以下的簽證／入境證簽發費為600元，而181日或以上的則為1,300元，屬合理和可負擔範圍水平。政府會密切留意相關情況，按機制適時檢討收費架構。

此外，為促進更多人才訪港交流，政府於二○二二年六月推出為期兩年的「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利先導計劃」（先導計劃），並於二○二四年六月把先導計劃恆常化為「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（短期訪客計劃）。在短期訪客計劃下，獲政府相關決策局／部門認可的機構可向界別內相關的非本地人才發出邀請信，獲邀人士可以訪客身分來港參與指定短期活動，而無須向入境處申請工作簽證／進入許可。他們每次來港可在不超過連續14個曆日期間參與指定短期活動，並可就該指定活動收取報酬。

截至二○二五年六月底，先導計劃及短期訪客計劃已合共批准讓超過36 950名非本地人才以訪客身分來港參與共6 200多項短期活動及盛事。其中，自二○二四年六月恆常化以來，共有超過1520名非本地人才獲批參與「文化藝術」界別下的指定短期活動。入境處沒有備存提問提及內地表演團體透過短期訪客計劃來港的統計數字。

為確保短期訪客計劃與時並進，政府不時審視計劃的涵蓋範圍及運作機制，務求使計劃能夠在風險可控的前提下，持續有效地促進相關界別發展，並提升香港的國際形象。自先導計劃推出以來，政府分別在二○二三年二月及二○二四年六月擴大計劃，在原有10個指定界別外，增加「金融」及「發展與建築」兩個界別，認可機構亦從計劃剛推出時約350個增加18%至現時的400多個，當中包括政府決策局／部門、公營／法定機構、專業組織和業界協會等。計劃下設有機制，各參與的政策局／部門均需協助把關，確保計劃的執行持續符合政策目標。短期訪客計劃的相關資料，包括目前涵蓋的認可機構和指定短期活動已上載入境處網站︰www.immd.gov.hk/hkt/services/visas/stv.html。

政府會繼續留意短期訪客計劃的實施情況和相關部門及業界的意見，適時檢討計劃的涵蓋範圍，以期在入境管制與便利之間取得適當平衡。在考慮是否進一步放寬短期訪客計劃時，政府必須考慮兩大原則，即合資格根據計劃來港進行指定短期活動的人士不會取代本地勞動力，及不會構成濫用風險（包括非法就業）。"
LCQ16: Measures to facilitate entry of performing groups into Hong Kong,2025-10-15 12:10,2025-10-15 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500270.htm,"âFollowing is a question by Dr the Hon Chan Han-pan and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

As announced by the Government, with effective from February 26 this year, a new application fee of $600 has been introduced for various admission schemes for talents and capital investors (specified admission schemes), and the visa/entry permit issuance fees have been raised to $600 (with a limit of stay of 180 days or below) and $1,300 (with a limit of stay of 181 days or more) respectively. There are views relaying that the aforesaid visa fees have put heavy financial pressure on performing groups coming from other places to Hong Kong and relying on donations to maintain their operation (e.g. Shengong opera troupes performing at the Yu Lan Festival), thus affecting the transmission and exchange of traditional cultures. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of Chinese Mainland traditional folklore performing groups (including Shengong opera troupes) admitted to Hong Kong under the specified admission schemes in each of the past three years, as well as their members involved (set out in a table);

(2) as it is learnt that quite a number of district organisations will invite Chinese Mainland performing groups to perform in Hong Kong during celebration events to promote cultural exchanges, whether the Government will consider waiving visa application and issuance fees or introducing a tiered fee system for members of those performing groups which do not charge the public for their performances, so as to encourage cultural exchanges in the community and promote the transmission of cultural heritage;

(3) of the number of Chinese Mainland performing groups permitted under the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (the STV Scheme) to participate in specified short-term activities in the arts and cultural sector during their stay as visitors since the regularisation of the scheme in 2024; and

(4) as there are views pointing out that although there is strong demand from district organisations for performances by traditional folklore performing groups, the visits of performing groups to Hong Kong via the STV Scheme are subject to the endorsement of the authorised host organisations (e.g. the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau) by way of invitation letters, which involves some difficulties in the process, whether the Government will consider further streamlining the relevant application procedures to enable more performing groups to come to Hong Kong for exchanges without having to apply for employment visas?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Security Bureau, the Labour and Welfare Bureau and the Immigration Department (ImmD), the reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Chan Han-pan is as follows:

(1) Eligible Mainland residents who possess special skills, knowledge or experience of value to and not readily available in Hong Kong may apply to come to work in Hong Kong under the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP) (the ""specified admission scheme"" as referred to in the question), including short-term or one-off project-based employment, if the conditions are met. In 2022, 2023, and 2024, the numbers of approved applications under the ASMTP related to the Mainland talents of the arts/culture sector were 285, 2 496 and 4 618 respectively. The ImmD does not maintain a breakdown of the statistics on applications involving traditional folk performing groups from the Mainland (including Shengong opera troupes).

(2) to (4) In devising the fee levels for the ASMTP, the Government has balanced various considerations. Among others, noting that some applications relate to short-term/one-off project-based employment, the Government has introduced two tiers of visa/entry permit issuance fee: $600 for visa/entry permit granted with a limit of stay of not more than 180 days, and $1,300 for those with a limit of stay of 181 days or more. The fee levels are modest and affordable. The Government will closely monitor the relevant situation and review the fee structure as appropriate in accordance with the established mechanism.

Besides, to encourage more talents to come to Hong Kong for exchanges, the Government launched a two-year Pilot Scheme on Immigration Facilitation for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (Pilot Scheme) in June 2022, which was regularised as the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (STV Scheme) in June 2024. Under the STV Scheme, organisations authorised by the relevant government bureaux/departments (B/Ds) can issue invitation letters to relevant non-local talents in their sectors. Invited persons may come to Hong Kong to participate in specified short-term activities as visitors without the need to apply for employment visas/entry permits from the ImmD. They may participate in specified short-term activities for up to 14 consecutive calendar days during each trip to Hong Kong, and receive remuneration for the specified activities concerned.

As of end-June 2025, the Pilot Scheme and the STV Scheme have approved for a total of more than 36950 non-local talents to enter Hong Kong as visitors to participate in a total of over 6 200 short-term activities and major events. Among others, since the regularisation of the scheme in June2024, a total of more than 1520 non-local talents have been approved to participate in the specified short-term activities under the ""Arts and Cultural"" sector. The ImmD does not maintain statistics of Mainland performing groups entering Hong Kong under the STVScheme as mentioned in the question.

To ensure that the STV Scheme keeps pace with the times, the Government reviews its coverage and operation mechanism from time to time, with a view to ensuring that it can continue to effectively promote the development of relevant sectors and raise Hong Kong's international profile while ensuring that the risks are manageable. Since the launch of the Pilot Scheme, the Government has expanded the scheme in February 2023 and June 2024, by adding two sectors, namely ""Finance"" and ""Development and Construction"", to the original 10 designated sectors. The number of authorised organisations has also increased by 18 per cent from around 350 when the scheme was first launched, to more than 400 at present. These authorised organisations include government B/Ds, public/statutory organisations, professional bodies and industry associations. Through an established mechanism, all participating B/Ds are required to assist in ensuring that the implementation of the scheme consistently meets policy objectives. Relevant information of the STVScheme, including the authorised organisations and specified short-term activities that are currently covered by the scheme, is available on the ImmD's website: www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/stv.html.

The Government will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the STVScheme as well as the views of the relevant departments and the sectors concerned, and timely review the scheme's coverage to strike an appropriate balance between immigration control and facilitation. In considering whether to further relax the STV Scheme, the Government shall take into account two major principles, i.e. eligible individuals visiting Hong Kong for specified short-term activities under the scheme will not displace the local workforce, and there will not be a risk of abuse (including illegal employment)."

答覆：

主席：

二○二五年立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日舉行，以選出第八屆立法會共90名議員。立法會選舉直接關係到「一國兩制」行穩致遠和香港特別行政區（特區）良政善治，長治久安，因此，特區政府極為重視。

就陳勇議員的各項提問，經諮詢公務員事務局，現綜合回覆如下：

目前，立法會換屆選舉的籌備工作正進行得如火如荼。選舉事務處積極進行各方面工作，包括部署選務人手安排、為選舉工作人員安排培訓及演練、為選舉資訊科技系統進行多輪測試、設置投票站、制訂保安及應變計劃等，以確保選舉在公平、公正、誠實、安全有序、高效和人性化的情況下順利舉行。

選舉提名期將於十月二十四日展開並至十一月六日結束。選舉事務處已準備就緒，為接受和處理提名表格作出妥善安排。待候選人資格審查委員會確認候選人資格後，選舉事務處會為候選人舉行簡介會，講解投票及點票安排。選舉事務處將會在十一月底前向選民及獲授權代表發送投票通知卡和候選人簡介等相關資料，通知他們應前往投票的投票站，以及讓選民對有關的候選人有更多認識。

為便利選民投票及提升其投票體驗，選舉事務處會繼續提供合併投票安排，讓選民可在同一投票站投下所有選票。一般而言，選舉事務處會編配選民在其選區並鄰近其登記住址的投票站投票。其他便利投票的措施包括：

（一）選舉事務處會設立鄰近邊境投票站，以便利投票日須往返内地的選民投票並為選擇這些投票站的選民進行預先登記；

（二）除了投票通知卡，選民可登入「選民資料網上查閱系統」檢視自己的登記詳情、獲編配的投票站及地圖、候選人簡介等資料；

（三）設立特別隊伍，讓有需要人士（即年滿70歲或以上人士、孕婦及因身體狀況而難以長時間站立排隊的人士）優先領取選票，並在投票站內設立座位區，供他們輪候時休息；以及

（四）超過九成的投票站將會設於無障礙場地，行動不便或需使用輪椅的選民若獲編配的投票站不方便他們進出，他們可在投票日前五天或之前向選舉事務處提出申請，重新編配到同一地方選區另一個設於無障礙場地的投票站。選舉事務處亦會按他們的需要協助聯絡香港復康會安排復康巴士接載他們往返投票站。

特區政府不斷致力優化選舉的各項流程安排。我們根據實際情況和需要，全盤考慮科技應用、效率提升、安全穩妥、私隱保障和公眾觀感等因素，引入更多資訊科技和智能技術。選舉事務處將：

（一）在功能界別選舉引入電子點票系統輔助點票，以達致提速、提效，以及長遠減省人手的目標；

（二）提升「選民資料網上查閱系統」以支援選民透過「智方便」登入系統，查閱獲編配的投票站及地圖、候選人簡介等資料；

（三）把大部分選舉相關表格電子化，即候選人可選擇使用電子填寫的功能，及透過網上平台提交，例如授權／委任各類代理人的選舉表格、與選舉廣告有關的選舉表格；以及

（四）新增以快速支付系統「轉數快」繳交選舉按金的選擇，候選人也可繼續使用現金、銀行本票及支票支付。

政府正以多元及多渠道方式廣泛宣傳選舉，增強市民對選舉的認知，以鼓勵他們踴躍投票。具體的宣傳活動包括舉辦社區互動活動（如巡迴展覽、攤位遊戲等）、懸掛戶外及交通廣告（如大廈外牆及街道張貼大型戶外廣告、港鐵巴士燈箱廣告等）、運用傳統及社交媒體宣傳（如電台電視及Facebook和Instagram等），以及其他大型重點活動如研討會及綜合晚會等。此外，政府亦會以創新且貼地的形式走進社區，例如在全港多處設置選舉吉祥物「票箱家族」的裝置，並結合擴增實境（AR）及虛擬實境（VR）技術，邀請市民互動體驗、拍照並上傳至社交媒體。同時，政府亦會將選舉與全國運動會的宣傳工作相互配合，以產生協同宣傳效果。

公務員是特區政府治理體系中的重要部分，肩負貫徹落實「一國兩制」和支持特區政府施政的責任。公務員應以身作則行使公民責任投票，在社會上起帶頭作用。選舉的工作由籌備、投票至點票環節，都涉及大量公務員一起參與，同心協力做好每一項工作。在二○二三年區議會一般選舉期間，特區政府透過不同的宣傳方式，例如向公務員發信、向部門辦公室派發宣傳單張、於社交平台發帖文／短片、走訪社區活動等，呼籲全體公務員，以至全港選民積極參與投票。有關安排都十分成功，並獲得公務員及市民的熱烈響應。特區政府在今次立法會換屆選舉中會繼續運用多元化、全方位的形式，積極做好各項宣傳推廣工作，推動公務員投入選舉。就投票日當天上班的人員，部門的主管人員必須容許需要投票的同事離開工作崗位到所屬票站投票，並為此訂定時間表，讓他們有序地前往投票，時間表亦須呈交有關部門首長，同事可申請發還往返辦公室和其所屬票站的交通（包括的士）費用。"
LCQ11: 2025 Legislative Council General Election,2025-10-15 12:03,2025-10-15 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500278.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Yung and a written reply by the Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Erick Tsang Kwok-wai, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

  Regarding the 2025 Legislative Council General Election (LCGE), will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the preparations for the 2025 LCGE, including the key stages of work, current progress and subsequent material junctures;

(2) of the specific new measures the Government has put in place to promote the 2025 LCGE, and of the progress of preparation and expected outcomes of the relevant publicity work;

(3) of the measures the Government has put in place to provide further convenience to electors, so as to enhance their voting desire and improve their voting experience;

(4) in respect of the application of technologies, whether the Government has plans to introduce more technology initiatives in public elections to further improve electoral processes and efficiency; if so, of the current progress of the study on this front; and

(5) given that during the 2023 District Council Ordinary Election, the Government had encouraged civil servants to duly fulfil their civic responsibilities and vote on polling day through various activities, how the Government will further encourage civil servants to actively participate in voting during the 2025 LCGE so as to set a good example in society?

Reply:

President,

  The 2025 Legislative Council General Election (LCGE) will be held on December 7 to return 90 members of the eighth term Legislative Council (LegCo). The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government attaches great importance to the LegCo election as it is directly related to the steadfast and successful implementation of ""one country, two systems"" and to the good governance and long-term stability of the HKSAR.

  Having consulted the Civil Service Bureau, a consolidated reply in response to the various questions raised by the Hon Chan Yung is as follows:

  The preparations for the LCGE are currently in full swing. The Registration and Electoral Office (REO) is actively undertaking a wide range of tasks, including the deployment of electoral staff, provision of training and drills for electoral staff, conduct of multiple rounds of testing for election information technology systems, set up polling stations, formulation of security and contingency plans, to ensure that the election will be smoothly conducted in a fair, just, honest, safe and orderly, efficient and user-friendly manner.

  The nomination period will run from October 24 to November 6. The REO had made appropriate arrangements and is ready to receive and process nomination forms. Upon the Candidate Eligibility Review Committee's confirmation of the eligibility of candidates, the REO will hold a briefing session for candidates to explain the polling and counting arrangements. The REO will send poll cards, Introduction to Candidates and related materials to electors and authorised representatives before the end of November, with a view to notifying them of their assigned polling station for casting their votes and enabling electors to gain a better understanding of the candidates concerned.

  To facilitate electors in casting their votes and enhance their voting experience, the REO will continue adopting the combined voting arrangement to allow electors to cast all their votes at the same polling station. In general, the REO will assign electors to vote at the polling station within their constituency and close to their registered residential address. Other facilitation measures for voting include:

(i) the REO will set up Near Boundary Polling Stations to facilitate electors who need to travel to and from the Mainland on the polling day. Prior registration will be made for electors who choose to vote at these polling stations;

(ii)besides the poll card, electors may access the Online Voter Information Enquiry System (OVIES) to view their registration details, assigned polling station and location map, and Introduction to Candidates, etc.;

(iii)a special queue will be set up for individuals in need (viz. persons aged 70 or above, pregnant women, and persons who are unable to queue for a long time due to physical conditions), who will have priority to obtain their ballot papers. A seating area will also be provided in the polling station for these electors to take rest while waiting; and

(iv)over 90 per cent of polling stations will be set up at venues with barrier-free access. If electors who have mobility difficulties or need to use wheelchair are allocated to inaccessible polling stations, they may apply to the REO at least five days before the polling day for re-allocation to a polling station set up at an accessible venue within the same geographical constituency. Where necessary, the REO will also assist in contacting the Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation for arranging Rehabuses to transport them to and from polling stations.

  The HKSAR Government has been striving to enhance the various electoral procedures and arrangements. We will, in light of the actual circumstances and needs, take holistic consideration of such factors as the application of technology, enhancement of efficiency, safety and security, privacy protection and public perception, etc, in introducing the wider use of information and smart technologies. The REO will:

(i)introduce the electronic counting system for the functional constituency election to facilitate vote counting, with a view to enhancing the speed, efficiency and achieving the target to reduce manpower in the long run;

(ii)upgrade the OVIES to support electors'login via ""iAM Smart"" for viewing their assigned polling station and its location map, Introduction to Candidates, etc;

(iii)digitalise most election-related forms, which allows candidates to use the electronic filling function and submit through the online platform, such as electoral forms for authorising/appointing various types of agents and forms relating to election advertisements; and

(iv)provide a new option of paying election deposits via the Faster Payment System, while candidates may continue to use cash, cashier's order or cheque for payment.

  The Government is promoting the election through diverse activities and channels to enhance the public's understanding of the election and encourage them to vote actively. Specific promotional activities include organising community interactive activities (such as roving exhibitions and game booths, etc), placing outdoor and transport advertisements (such as large outdoor advertisements on external walls of buildings and streets, as well as MTR and bus lightbox advertising, etc), launching promotion through traditional and social media platforms (such as radio, television, Facebook and Instagram, etc), and conducting other large-scale events such as a seminar and variety show, etc. In addition, the Government is reaching out to the community with a novel and down-to-earth approach. For example, the installation of the election mascots Ballot Box Family at various locations across the territory is combined with augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies to invite the public to interact, take photos and upload them to the social media. At the same time, the Government will co-ordinate the promotional efforts for the election and the National Games to create synergetic publicity effect.

  As a key component of the HKSAR Government's governance system, civil servants shoulder the responsibility of fully implementing ""one country, two systems"" and supporting the governance of the HKSAR Government. Civil servants should take the lead in society and set an example by fulfilling their civic responsibility to vote. A large number of civil servants have been engaged in election-related work, from preparation, polling to counting, who have made concerted efforts to ensure the smooth completion of every task. During the 2023District Council Ordinary Election, the HKSAR Government appealed to all civil servants as well as electors in Hong Kong to actively cast their votes through various publicity channels, such as writing to civil servants, distributing promotional leaflets to departmental offices, publishing posts/videos on social media platforms, holding events to reach out to the community, etc. The related arrangements were very successful and received overwhelming response from civil servants and the public. For the upcoming LCGE, the HKSAR Government will continue to employ diverse and comprehensive means to proactively optimise various publicity and promotional initiatives, with a view to encouraging civil servants to participate in the election. As for staff who are required to work on the polling day, departmental managers must release those who need to vote to cast their votes at their designated polling stations. Timetables should be prepared accordingly to facilitate staff to leave the office for voting in an orderly manner. Also, such timetables must be submitted to the Heads of Departments concerned. Colleagues may apply for reimbursement of transport (including taxi) fares for travelling between their offices and designated polling stations."

立法會八題：​南港島線（西段）項目,2025-10-15 11:30,2025-10-15 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500188.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上邱達根議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

政府於去年十二月公布將會採用智慧綠色集體運輸系統推展南港島線（西段），替代原有重型鐵路方案，並計劃在今年內開展詳細規劃及設計，目標爭取在二○二七年開展前期建造工程。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）南港島線（西段）項目的規劃及設計工作的最新進展為何，以及何時公布整項工程的具體詳情，包括預計的動工及竣工日期，以及涉及的人手及開支等；

（二）就在南港島線（西段）引入中國內地或海外採用的智慧綠色集體運輸系統、先進技術和管理模式，政府曾經進行哪些相關的可行性研究，以及該等研究的結果為何；政府是否已基於研究結果得出初步的傾向性取態和決定；及

（三）鑑於根據政府資料，南港島線（西段）將途經數碼港及香港大學等創科發展的核心區域和院校，為促進本港創科的可持續發展，政府有否全面檢視該項目的施工計劃及時間表，以令其可盡快上馬和落成通車；若有，詳情為何（包括整個項目如何分階段進行、有哪些工序可精簡和壓縮、相關工程造價、預計最早通車時間，以及其他可令工程提速、提效的具體措施）？

答覆：

主席：

南港島線（西段）初步走線全長約7.5公里，途經香港仔、華富、數碼港、瑪麗醫院及薄扶林一帶，為香港島的西部及南部地區提供便捷的接駁交通服務，便利市民前往港鐵南港島線黃竹坑站和港島線香港大學站。就提問各部分，經諮詢路政署，現回覆如下：

（一）我們一直積極推展南港島線（西段）的規劃工作，並於去年十二月及今年一月先後向立法會鐵路事宜小組委員會及南區區議會匯報項目的最新進展。我們正繼續評估項目的財務安排，包括進一步優化走線以及提高成本效益，以期今年內開展項目詳細規劃及設計，並爭取於二○二七年開展前期建造工程。我們的目標是在今年內公布項目的最新推展時間表。

當詳細規劃及設計階段開展後，我們會就項目進行法定環境影響評估，以及評估項目在建造期間及建成後對其他道路使用者的交通影響。我們亦會與不同持份者溝通，聽取意見，並敲定建議方案的細節（包括系統設計、造價、財務安排、管理模式等）。

（二）根據政府就不同智慧綠色集體運輸系統項目進行的研究和系統供應商及營運商提供的資訊，智慧綠色集體運輸系統為中低運量系統。相比重型鐵路系統，智慧綠色集體運輸系統體積較小，主要採用膠轆行駛，特點是輕巧、爬坡能力強，所引致的噪音及景觀影響會相對較少，加上系統一般不需要架空電纜等設施，機電支援系統及維修保養工程相對簡單。這類系統適合在上坡、已發展及空間有限的地區行駛，普遍能夠避免深入地底，減少乘客往返地面的時間，預期能夠提高運輸效益。南港島線（西段）項目採用的智慧綠色集體運輸系統將會在詳細規劃及設計階段，經參考各種先進系統技術和營運模式後敲定。

（三）我們一直與其他政府部門和機構緊密協調，務求南港島線（西段）項目能夠妥善銜接香港大學、數碼港及沿線其他設施，並盡量配合相關發展。正如回覆第一部分所述，項目建議方案的細節會在詳細規劃及設計階段敲定。我們會積極考慮採取各種創新技術，如組裝合成法，盡量壓縮推展時間，以盡快落成通車。我們亦會繼續審視並研究其他提速提效的方法，包括加快審批流程等，力爭早日完工。"

問題：

據報不少市民喜歡獨自遠足，但近年涉及獨自遠足人士的意外時有發生。有意見認為，獨自遠足人士在發生意外後往往未能及時報警求助，延誤了搜救行動，同時在沒有同伴提醒下，容易低估了山徑路線風險或高估自己的體能，導致意外發生。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年涉及獨自遠足人士的求助個案數目為何；該等求助個案的傷亡人數，以及有關搜救行動所涉及的政府開支為何；

（二）有否研究過去三年遠足意外的主要成因；有否統計，該等意外中獨自遠足人士和結伴遠足人士的比例，以及兩者在搜索及拯救難度和時間上的差異為何；及

（三）會否加強宣傳，鼓勵結伴遠足，並將險要路段定為「獨自遠足人士意外黑點」，以提醒遠足人士切勿獨自前往？

消防處沒有備存涉及獨自遠足人士的求助個案數字。由於上述拯救行動不涉及額外人力資源及薪酬開支，消防處沒有備存所涉開支的分項數字。

（二）及（三）遠足意外的成因及性質複雜多樣，除地勢和環境因素外，亦包括天氣變化、迷路和其他個人原因等。就攀山拯救事故的數字，政府沒有備存有關獨自與結伴遠足的比例，以及兩者在搜索及拯救時間上差異的分項數字。然而，獨自遠足相比結伴遠足是會增加安全風險，以及發生意外時救援的困難。政府一直從不同途徑呼籲遠足人士切勿獨自遠足，並應結伴同行，包括在漁農自然護理署「郊野樂行」專頁（www.hiking.gov.hk）發放相關訊息、制作網上短片、在社交媒體不時發文提示等，亦於遠足旺季，聯同其他相關政府部門加強相關宣傳教育。

此外，我們持續鼓勵遠足人士下載與緊急救援相關的手機應用程式（如「郊野樂行遠足留蹤」流動應用程式、HKSOS等），提升遠足人士的安全意識和在意外發生後的搜救效率。「郊野樂行」專頁亦提供不同遠足路徑的綜合資訊，包括路徑的長短、難度、配套等，讓遊人因應自身情況妥善規劃適合自身的行程；以及根據過去發生嚴重或致命意外的地點、相關個案的意外成因、現場地勢等因素，列出郊野公園曾發生致命及嚴重意外的高危地點，提醒遠足人士避免前往，並會定期檢視及按需要更新高危地點的名單。"

Question:

The Government announced in December last year that it would adopt Smart and Green Mass Transit System (SGMTS) to take forward the South Island Line (West) (SIL(W)) as an alternative to the original heavy rail scheme. Detailed planning and design are scheduled to begin within this year, with the aim of striving to start the preliminary construction work in 2027. In ‍this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the latest progress of the planning and design work for the SIL(W) project, and the expected announcement date for the specific details of the entire project, including the estimated start and completion dates, as well as manpower and expenditure involved;

(2) regarding the introduction of SGMTS, advanced technologies and management models adopted in the Chinese Mainland or overseas for the SIL(W) project, of the relevant feasibility studies that have been conducted by the Government and the findings of these studies; whether the Government has reached preliminary inclination or decision based on the study findings; and

(3) given that, according to Government information, SIL(W) will pass through core innovation and technology development areas and institutions, such as Cyberport and the University of Hong Kong, whether the Government has holistically reviewed the project's construction plan and timetable to facilitate its early commencement and completion, with a view to promoting the sustainable development of innovation and technology in Hong Kong; if so, of the details (including how the entire project will be carried out in phases, which work procedures can be streamlined and compressed, the relevant construction costs, the earliest expected commissioning date, and other specific measures to enhance speed and efficiency of the project)?

Reply:

President,

The preliminary alignment of the South Island Line (West) (SIL(W)) is about 7.5-kilometre long, passing through areas around Aberdeen, Wah Fu, Cyberport, Queen Mary Hospital and Pok Fu Lam. It will provide a convenient feeder services connecting the western and southern parts of Hong Kong Island and facilitate the public to go to the MTR Wong Chuk Hang Station of the South Island Line and HKU Station of the Island Line. Having consulted the Highways Department, the reply to the respective parts of the question is as follows:

(1) We have been actively taking forward the planning work of the SIL(W) and updated the Legislative Council Subcommittee on Matters Relating to Railways and the Southern District Council on the latest development of the project in December last year and January this year respectively. We are continuing to evaluate the project's financial arrangements, including further optimising the alignment and improving cost-effectiveness, with a view to commencing the detailed planning and design of the project within this year and striving to commence the advance construction works in 2027. We target to announce the latest implementation programme of the project this year.

Once the detailed planning and design stage has commenced, we will conduct the statutory environmental impact assessment for the project and assess its traffic impact on other road users during and after construction. We will also engage various stakeholders, gather their feedback, and finalise the details of the proposed scheme (including the design of the system, cost, financial arrangements and management mode).

(2) With reference to the studies by the Government on different Smart and Green Mass Transit System (SGMTS) projects and the information obtained from the system suppliers and operators, SGMTS is a medium-to-low capacity system. Compared to the heavy rail system, SGMTS is smaller in size and mainly runs on rubber tyres. Characterised by its lightweight and strong climbing capability, it would induce less noise and visual impacts. Furthermore, the system generally does not require the installation of overhead lines, and its electrical and mechanical support systems and maintenance works are relatively simpler. This type of system is suitable for operating in hilly, developed and congested areas. It can generally avoid running deep underground and reduce the time of passengers traveling to and from the ground level, and is expected to enhance the transport benefits. The SGMTS to be adopted in the SIL(W) project will be determined in the detailed planning and design stage, upon taking into account advanced technologies and operating modes of different systems.

(3) We have been co-ordinating closely with other government departments and organisations for smooth interfaces of the SIL(W) project with the University of Hong Kong, Cyberport and other facilities along the alignment and for facilitating related developments as much as possible. As mentioned in Part (1) of the reply, the details of the proposed scheme of the project will be finalised during the detailed planning and design stage. We will actively consider adopting different innovative technologies, such as the use of Modular Integrated Construction (MiC), to compress the implementation programme as much as possible for the commissioning of the project at the earliest. We will also continue to explore and review other methods to enhance the speed as well as efficiency, including expediting the approval process, to strive for early completion of the project."
LCQ7: Safety of hikers,2025-10-15 11:30,2025-10-15 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500243.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon So Cheung-wing and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

 It has been reported that quite a number of members of the public like hiking alone, but accidents involving lone hikers have occurred from time to time in recent years. There are views that lone hikers are often unable to report to the Police for assistance promptly after accidents, causing delays in search and rescue (S&R) operations, and in the absence of reminders from companions, they are susceptible to underestimating trail risks or overestimating their physical fitness, thus resulting in accidents. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of requests for assistance involving lone hikers in the past three years; the number of casualties in such cases requesting assistance, and the Government expenditures involved in the relevant S&R operations;

(2) whether it has studied the main causes of hiking accidents in the past three years; whether it has compiled statistics on the proportion of lone hikers and group hikers in such accidents, and the differences in the difficulty and duration of search and rescue between the two; and

(3) whether it will step up publicity to encourage hiking in groups, and classify dangerous paths as ""accident black spots for lone hikers"" to alert hikers not to go there alone?

Reply:

President,

 Having consulted the Security Bureau, the reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon So Cheung-wing is as follow:

(1) In the past three years, the number of mountain search and rescue calls received by the Fire Services Department (FSD) and the number of casualties involved are tabulated below:




Year
Number of mountain search and rescue calls received
Number of Injuries (Fatalities)


2022
1 014 cases
589 (20)


2023
695 cases
424 (15)


2024
588 cases
345 (15)




 The FSD does not maintain statistics on the number of cases of lone hikers seeking assistance. As the above rescue operations did not involve additional manpower and salary expenditure, the FSD does not keep a breakdown of the expenditure involved.

(2) and (3) The causes and nature of hiking accidents are complex and varied, apart from factors of terrain and environment, they also include changes in weather, hikers getting lost, and other personal reasons of hikers. Regarding the number of mountain rescue cases, the Government does not have the breakdown of the cases by the proportion of hiking alone versus hiking with others, nor the figure of the difference in the time used for search and rescue operations between those two kinds of hikers. However, hiking alone will have higher safety risks than hiking with others, and poses greater difficulty on search and rescue when accidents occur. The Government has been urging the public to hike with others instead of hiking alone through various channels, including disseminating relevant information through the ""Enjoy Hiking"" website (www.hiking.gov.hk) of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, producing online videos, and regular publishing reminder posts on social media platform, etc. The AFCD also collaborates with other relevant departments to enhance relevant promotion and education during hiking season.

 Moreover, we continuously encourage hikers to download mobile applications relevant to emergency rescue (such as ""Enjoy Hiking Hiker Tracking Service"" mobile application, HKSOS, etc.), to raise the hikers' awareness of hiking safety, and enhance efficiency of rescue operations when accidents occur. The ""Enjoy Hiking"" website provides comprehensive information on various hiking trails, including trail length, overall difficulty, nearby facilities, for hikers to plan hiking trips that are suitable for themselves according their personal conditions. The website also lists out high risk locations with records of fatal and serious accidents in country parks, which are formulated based on previous records of serious and fatal accidents, causes of such accidents, as well as site conditions, with a view to reminding hikers to avoid visiting those areas. The list will be regularly reviewed and updated as appropriate."
立法會十八題：保護兒童的相關法例,2025-10-15 11:05,2025-10-15 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500213.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上陳家珮議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，保障兒童的安全及福祉極為重要，但本港保護兒童的相關法例的尺度及所訂的兒童年齡上限並不統一，有需要作出檢討。例如在《僱用兒童規例》（第57B章）下，年滿13歲及15歲者分別可受僱於非工業機構和受僱於工業工作；在《婚姻條例》（第181章）下，年滿16歲者可在提交父母或監護人的書面同意書後結婚；而在《侵害人身罪條例》（第212章）第27條下，有關「對所看管兒童或少年人虐待或忽略」罪行所訂的兒童年齡上限則為16歲，家長獨留不足16歲兒童在家便可能觸犯法例。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年因觸犯第212章第27條而遭定罪的人數，以及當中涉及獨留兒童在家的個案數目為何；

（二）據悉有學校向家長表示，小學三年級或以上的學生已可無須家長接送並自行往返學校，當局是否知悉有關情況，以及有否就第212章的相關法例規定向學校作出清晰指引，以防範意外發生；

（三）有否計劃全面檢討保護兒童安全的相關法例，以統一標準及更好地保障兒童的福祉；及

（四）鑑於行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》宣布會優化在校課後託管服務計劃，取消名額上限以擴大支援有需要的小學生和家長，但有意見指出該計劃只涵蓋小學生，按現時第212章第27條的規定，意味育有12歲至16歲以下兒童的家長仍難以外出工作，政府有否政策措施協助該等家長，以鼓勵生育及釋放勞動力？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直以來採取多管齊下的策略保護兒童，令他們免受傷害或虐待。政府除了及早識別和介入虐待兒童個案以保護兒童，亦會支援有虐兒風險的家庭從源頭上預防虐待兒童。就議員的提問，經徵詢保安局及教育局，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）二○二○年至二○二五年上半年，因干犯《侵害人身罪條例》（第212章）第27條，即虐待或忽略所看管的兒童或少年人，被定罪的人數見附件。政府沒有備存其中涉及獨留兒童在家的個案數目。

（二）及（四）《侵害人身罪條例》（第212章）第27條規定，任何超過16歲的人如故意襲擊、虐待、忽略、拋棄或遺棄由他所管養、看管或照顧的16歲或以下的兒童或少年人，而相當可能導致其受到不必要的苦楚或健康損害，即屬犯罪。

具體而言，容許兒童自行往返學校或獨留兒童在家會否觸犯上述條例取決於多方面因素，並視乎個別案情而定，例如該兒童的實際年齡和自我照顧能力，有關行為是否對兒童構成傷害、涉案人士是否有照顧責任、是否有意圖疏忽照顧該兒童及是否知悉其行為可能會對該兒童構成傷害等，不能一概而論。

就學童往返學校的方式，教育局十分重視學生的安全，並一直與學校攜手合作，致力為學生締造安全的環境。教育局已為學校編訂《學校行政手冊》和「學生安全及健康措施一覽表」，支援學校履行其職責，提升學生安全及健康管理。現時，小學普遍已訂定校本政策安排學生安全有序往返學校，包括校車服務、放學隊、家長接送等候區等。如有家長選擇讓其子女自行往返學校，應考慮其居住地點與學校的距離、子女的自理能力等；與此同時，學校亦應教導學生交通安全知識，包括時刻遵守交通規則，透過家校合作促進學生有效學習和健康成長。

就在校課後託管服務計劃（計劃），政府在二○二三／二四學年推行計劃，讓有需要的小學生可在課後留校，在安全熟悉的環境下接受託管及學習支援，方便家長外出工作，雙職及單親家庭亦可受惠。政府在二○二五／二六學年進一步優化計劃，取消名額上限，擴大支援有需要的小學生和家長。中學生踏入青少年階段，自理能力一般較高，服務需要與小學生不相同，家長需要的支援也不相同。全港有139間綜合青少年服務中心提供全面及多元化的服務，包括指導和輔導、支援計劃、發展和社交活動，以及社區參與活動，讓青少年在課餘時間充實及增值自我。

（三）現行多條法例保護兒童免受不同種類的傷害，包括《僱用兒童規例》（第57B章）、《婚姻條例》（第181章）、《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）、《侵害人身罪條例》（第212章）、《保護兒童及少年條例》（第213章）、《防止兒童色情物品條例》（第579章）、及將在明年一月二十日生效的《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》（第650章）等。政府會繼續確保各法例的實施妥善到位，並會適時監察成效，考慮如何進一步加強保護兒童的工作，包括在有實際需要時檢討各保護兒童的相關法例。"
LCQ18: Legislation related to protecting children,2025-10-15 11:05,2025-10-15 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500220.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Judy Chan and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

  There are views that safeguarding children's safety and well-being is of paramount importance, but as the scope of Hong Kong's legislation related to protecting children and the age ceilings for children stipulated therein are inconsistent, a review is warranted. For example, under the Employment of Children Regulations (Cap. 57B), persons who have attained 13 and 15 years may be employed in non-industrial establishments and in industrial work respectively; under the Marriage Ordinance (Cap. 181), persons who have attained 16 years may marry upon production of written consent from their parents or guardians; while under section 27 of the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212), the age ceiling for children stipulated in respect of the offence of ""ill-treatment or neglect by those in charge of child or young person"" is 16, and parents may breach the law by leaving children aged below 16 unattended at home. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of persons convicted for contravening section 27 of Cap. 212 in each of the past five years, and among them, the number of cases involving leaving children unattended at home;

(2) as it is learnt that some schools have informed parents that students in primary three or above may travel to and from school by themselves without parental escort, whether the authorities know about this situation, and whether clear guidelines regarding the requirements of relevant legislative provisions under Cap. 212 are issued to schools, with a view to preventing the occurrence of accidents;

(3) whether it has plans to comprehensively review the legislation related to safeguarding children's safety, with a view to standardising the standards and better safeguarding the well-being of children; and

(4) as the Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address that the School-based After School Care Service Scheme would be enhanced by uncapping the number of places to expand support for primary students and parents in need, but there are views pointing out that the scheme only covers primary students, and under the existing provisions of section 27 of Cap. 212, it implies that parents with children aged 12 to below 16 still face difficulties in going out to work, whether the Government has policy initiatives in place to assist such parents, so as to encourage childbearing and unleash the labour force?

Reply:

President,

  The Government has been adopting a multi-pronged strategy to protect children from harm or abuse. Apart from identifying and intervening in child abuse cases at an early stage to protect children, the Government also supports families at risk of child abuse to prevent child abuse at source. The consolidated reply to the Member's question, in consultation with the Security Bureau and the Education Bureau (EDB), is as follows:

(1) The number of persons convicted of an offence under section 27 of the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212), i.e. ill-treatment or neglect by those in charge of child or young person, from 2020 to the first half of 2025 is set out in the Annex. The Government does not compile statistics on the number of these cases involving leaving children unattended at home.

(2) and (4) Section 27 of the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212) stipulates that any person over the age of 16 years who wilfully assaults, ill-treats, neglects, abandons or exposes such child or young person under the age of 16 years under his custody, charge or care in a manner likely to cause such child or young person unnecessary suffering or injury to his health shall be guilty of a criminal offence.

Specifically, whether allowing a child to travel to and from school by themselves or leaving a child unattended at home would constitute an offence under the above legislation depends on a number of factors and has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, including the child's age and self-care abilities, whether the act has caused harm to the child, whether the person involved has a responsibility of care over the child, and whether the person has intentionally neglected the child and is aware of the possible harm to the child caused by his act, and cannot be generalised.

Regarding the ways students commute between homes and schools, the EDB attaches great importance to students' safety and has been working with schools to create a safe environment for students. The EDB has compiled the School Administration Guide and the ""Checklist of Student Safety and Health Measures"" to support schools in fulfilling their responsibilities and enhancing student safety and health management. Currently, primary schools generally have established school-based policies to ensure the safe and orderly transportation of students, including school bus services, returning-home teams, and designated parent drop-off/pick-up areas. If parents choose to have their children travel to and from the school independently, they should consider the distance from their residence to the school and their children's ability to manage themselves. Schools should also teach students about road safety, including the importance of always obeying traffic rules, to foster effective learning and healthy development of students through home-school co-operation.

In respect of the School-based After School Care Service Scheme (the Scheme), the Government launched the Scheme in the 2023/24 school year, with a view to allowing primary students in need to stay after school to receive care and learning support in a safe and familiar environment, and enabling parents to take up jobs. Both dual-income families and single-parent families will be benefitted. In the 2025/26 school year, the Scheme is further enhanced by uncapping the number of service places to expand support for primary students and parents in need. As secondary school students enter adolescence, their self-care abilities are generally higher. Their service needs become different from those of primary school students, and the support required by their parents is also different. There are 139 Integrated Children and Youth Services Centres in Hong Kong, providing comprehensive and diversified services, including guidance and counselling, supportive programmes, developmental and socialisation programmes, and community engagement programmes, which enable youths to enrich and enhance themselves during leisure time.

(3) At present, there are many pieces of legislation in place that protect children from different kinds of harm, including the Employment of Children Regulations (Cap. 57B), the Marriage Ordinance (Cap. 181), the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200), the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212), the Protection of Children and Juveniles Ordinance (Cap. 213), the Prevention of Child Pornography Ordinance (Cap. 579), and the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance (Cap. 650) which will be effective from January 20, 2026. The Government will continue to ensure the proper and solid implementation of these pieces of legislation, and will suitably monitor their effectiveness and consider how to further strengthen child protection, including reviewing the relevant child protection legislation when there is an actual need."

AFCD urges grave sweepers to prevent hill fires,2025-10-15 11:00,2025-10-15 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101400228.htm,"The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) today (October 15) reminded people paying tribute to ancestors at graveyards in the countryside during the Chung Yeung Festival period to exercise caution and prevent hill fires.

An AFCD spokesman said it is an offence under the Forests and Countryside Ordinance (Cap. 96) to leave behind kindling or burn offerings without considering fire risks in the countryside. Any person who contravenes the ordinance may be prosecuted and is liable to a maximum fine of $25,000 and one year's imprisonment upon conviction.

AFCD staff will step up patrols at graveyards in the countryside during the Chung Yeung Festival period and take enforcement action against any irregularities.

The majority of hill fires in the countryside are caused by human negligence. Accidents can be prevented if grave sweepers observe some simple guidelines:

* Remove weeds around graves with tools and never burn weeds;
* Burning should only be done inside a container or iron bucket;
* Never leave burning offerings unattended; and
* Make sure all kindling is put out before leaving.

The spokesman said that metal containers for burning offerings properly will be handed out to grave sweepers who have such a need at suitable locations in country parks during the Chung Yeung Festival. The AFCD will also patrol hill fire black spots and distribute hill fire prevention leaflets together with the Fire Services Department and the Civil Aid Service.

Members of the public are reminded to keep the countryside clean and properly clean up their offerings or rubbish."

Upon arrival, he attended the annual Gala Dinner of the National Committee on United States-China Relations (NCUSCR) and met with the NCUSCR Chair and former US Trade Representative, Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky. During their meeting, they exchanged views on current China-US economic and trade relations, as well as issues relating to trade, investment and financial markets between Hong Kong and the US. Mr Chan also briefed Ambassador Barshefsky on the latest developments in Hong Kong.

During the meeting, Mr Chan expressed his pleasure at having the opportunity to visit the US again and engage in face-to-face exchanges with leaders from the American political, business and academic communities, with a view to briefing them on the latest developments of Hong Kong. He noted the strong and close economic and trade ties between Hong Kong and the US. Despite the significant uncertainties currently facing the global economy, under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong will continue to maintain its status as a free port, uphold the common law system and rule of law, sustain a simple and low tax regime, and implement open, stable and predictable economic and trade policies. Hong Kong continues to welcome US businesses to invest and expand their presence in the city. Mr Chan recognised the important and active role the NCUSCR has long played in promoting Hong Kong-US economic and trade relations and expressed hope for continued close co-operation with the Committee to create more opportunities for the business communities of both places.

The Gala Dinner is a major annual event organised by the NCUSCR, bringing together prominent political, business and academic leaders from both China and the US, with a view to facilitating exchanges and co-operation between the two countries. This year's event was attended by around 300 leaders and guests, including China's Ambassador to the US, Mr Xie Feng, who gave a speech at the dinner.

Mr Chan will continue his visit to New York today (October 15, New York time), meeting with local political and business leaders to share the latest developments and opportunities in Hong Kong."

記者：現在心情如何？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：（中國香港隊）贏不到當然有少許可惜，不過我們頂得住1比1都是開心的。我很開心見到我們香港隊今日全部球員很拼搏，打出了我們中國香港隊應有的精神，還有數名球員全場沒有停過，（例如）茹子楠、14號劉家喬、陳晉一等真的沒有停過。我想我們盡了力，亦拿到一分，希望可以在接下來下一場主場取勝。我亦很感謝球迷沒有停過打氣，我也聲沙，他們可以喊了數小時還這麼好力氣，完全繼續為我們港隊主場打氣，很感謝他們。我也很開心有一場很好的比賽讓大家觀賞到。

記者：有這麼好的球迷、這麼好的球員，是否可以將啟德主場館定為港足（中國香港足球隊）真主場？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：足總（中國香港足球總會）一直與啟德體育園商討，我們會盡量希望可以達成一個雙方都合理、雙方都有利的協議。政府亦會繼續支持中國香港隊和香港足球，包括港超聯（香港超級聯賽）。事實上，球場一直是個問題。康文署（康樂及文化事務署）過往每年大約預留127節供港超（聯球隊）作為主場或使用草地練習，今年已增加到252節。另外，以前康文署場地對於打氣，例如用鼓、擴音器有較多限制。現在大家都看到，球迷入場除了看場好賽事外，他們也很享受氣氛，我們也覺得這樣是很好的，我們也鼓勵球迷多點幫我們的球隊打氣，所以這個月（相關限制）又放寬了。接下來我們會繼續支持香港足球，也希望我們中國香港隊下一場在主場對新加坡時可以大獲全勝，那我們就很有機會出線了。

記者：剛才最緊張是哪個環節？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：我們幾乎可以2比0的，那球「笠射」我想只差一點而已。另外我們有球員被趕出場，兩黃一紅，心是沉一沉的，不過足球就是這樣。

記者：見到這樣好的球迷，有甚麼說話想對球迷和球員說？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：多謝球迷，還有請他們介紹我吃甚麼喉糖可以不聲沙的，多謝各位。"
​第十五屆全國運動會自行車（公路）賽（男子個人賽）安排（附圖／短片）,2025-10-14 22:30,2025-10-14 23:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400867.htm,"第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）自行車（公路）賽（男子個人賽）將於十一月八日舉行。全國運動會香港賽區統籌辦公室（全運會統籌辦）主任楊德強今日（十月十四日）聯同相關政府部門和中國香港單車總會代表舉行記者會，介紹賽事內容，以及臨時交通管制措施、口岸通關、應急救援及其他賽事相關安排。

今年的自行車（公路）賽（男子個人賽）是十五運會唯一橫跨粵港澳三個賽區的賽事，三地在去年十一月曾舉行測試賽，九月三十日亦進行了賽前綜合演練，過程大致順利。正式賽事賽道全程231.8公里，其中香港賽段為55.8公里，途經港珠澳大橋，然後前往香港口岸人工島、北大嶼山公路和竹篙灣公路，進入香港迪士尼樂園度假區後折返，再經港珠澳大橋前往橫琴，然後返回珠海。

賽事在十一月八日上午九時開始，預計下午二時三十分結束，屆時將有來自內地及港澳25支隊伍共104名運動員競逐獎項。預計車隊在上午約十時二十分進入香港段，並在香港段作賽約一個半小時。

為方便公眾觀賞賽事，香港迪士尼樂園度假區以外的幻想道行人路將設公眾觀賞區，可容納約數百名觀眾，市民可到場觀賽和為運動員打氣。警方會視乎現場情況，適時實施人流管制措施，請市民聽從現場警方及工作人員指示。由於北大嶼山公路的賽道路段將實施臨時交通管制措施，市民應盡量乘搭港鐵到迪士尼站再步行前往指定觀賞區。廣東賽區已委託主廣播機構中央電視台直播相關賽事，所有持權媒體，包括香港三間免費電視台和香港電台，均可取得直播訊號。

為配合賽事進行，當日港珠澳大橋香港口岸、大橋以及部分道路需要實施臨時管控措施，有關安排詳列如下：

（一）通關安排

賽事當日，港珠澳大橋東行由珠海／澳門往香港方向，由上午九時至下午十二時三十分實施臨時管控；而港珠澳大橋西行由香港往珠海／澳門方向，則由上午七時三十分至下午十二時三十分實施臨時管控。臨時管控期間，所有車輛禁止使用大橋，離境的通關服務將有特別安排。若有旅客或車輛計劃於臨時管控措施實施前離港前往珠海或澳門，他們必須於當日早上六時三十分前抵達港珠澳大橋香港口岸旅檢大樓出境大堂或出境車輛通關廣場，以辦理離境及通關手續。香港口岸旅檢大樓出境大堂及出境車輛通關廣場將於上午六時三十分關閉。

港珠澳大橋香港口岸的離境通關服務預計於當日下午十二時三十分後恢復正常運作，屆時預計交通將會較為繁忙，計劃於當日使用大橋的旅客及司機請預早規劃行程，並留意珠海市內交通管制的安排。

（二）公共交通運輸安排

當日港珠澳大橋主橋及香港口岸實施臨時管控期間，經港珠澳大橋來往香港與珠海及澳門的跨境公共運輸服務，包括港珠澳大橋穿梭巴士（金巴）、跨境直通巴士及香港國際機場海天中轉大樓的客車服務將會暫停。由於珠海市內的道路因比賽仍然封閉直至下午約二時三十分，香港往珠海的金巴介乎下午十二時三十分至一時三十分將提供有限度服務，而珠海往香港的金巴將於下午二時三十分恢復服務。另外，來往香港與澳門之間的金巴將於下午十二時三十分恢復服務。

此外，在實施臨時管控期間，來往港珠澳大橋香港口岸的本地公共運輸服務，包括機場巴士「A」線、接駁巴士路線「B」線及接駁迪士尼樂園的「R」線，將會實施臨時服務調整，當中由機場開出的「A」線由上午十時至下午一時期間暫停途經香港口岸。而由市區及新界前往機場的「A」線會由首班車至上午十一時三十分暫停途經香港口岸。接駁巴士來往港珠澳大橋香港口岸與機場／欣澳站的第B4及B5號線則會於部分時間暫停服務，而接駁迪士尼樂園與青嶼幹線轉車站及屯門站的第R8及R33號線亦會於部分時間暫停服務。另外，為確保賽事順利進行，順朗路（來回方向）將會封閉，詳見下文（三），受影響的巴士路線需臨時改道。巴士公司會張貼通告通知受影響乘客有關服務調整的詳情。

運輸署將通知受影響的跨境及本地公共運輸服務營辦商，海事處亦會聯絡跨境渡輪營運商，以制訂人手及班次安排。在實施臨時管控期間，旅客可使用香港與深圳之間的陸路口岸來往香港與珠海，亦可考慮乘搭跨境渡輪服務來往香港與澳門。

當天上午六時至中午十二時的「港車北上」預約申請將會暫停。視乎當日實際交通管控安排，預約當天下午時段「港車北上」的駕駛人士於臨時管控結束後（預計於下午約十二時三十分後）方可進入香港口岸出境車輛通關廣場。

香港國際機場海天中轉大樓的客車服務方面，當日來往香港國際機場、珠海口岸和澳門口岸的客車服務會在港珠澳大橋香港口岸實施臨時管控期間暫停。香港機場管理局將與各服務營辦商保持緊密聯繫，並根據最新情況檢視及調整安排。

另外，十五運會自行車（公路）賽（女子個人賽）將於十一月九日舉行，雖然比賽路線主要涉及珠海市內，不影響港珠澳大橋及口岸通關服務，但由於賽事關係，珠海市內部分道路將會封閉，在當日上午七時三十分至十一時三十分期間，金巴往珠海只能夠提供有限度服務，建議市民避免在上述時段乘坐金巴前往珠海。此外，香港與珠海九洲港十一月八日和九日部分渡輪航班亦會暫停。

（三）道路管制安排

位於北大嶼山公路及香港迪士尼樂園度假區及附近道路的賽道路段，將於香港段比賽期間實施滾動式臨時交通管制措施（確實時間將視乎賽事的實際進程）。

位於北大嶼山公路的賽道路段當日將實施滾動式臨時交通管制措施，屆時，經北大嶼山公路來往機場的行車時間預計需要增加約30分鐘。計劃往返機場的市民和旅客應預早計劃行程，預留充裕交通時間，盡量使用鐵路服務，包括機場快綫、東涌綫及迪士尼綫，避免駕駛車輛前往有關路段。如出行人士需駕車前往機場，應考慮使用屯門─赤鱲角隧道進出機場。

位於香港迪士尼樂園度假區附近道路的賽道路段，將於賽事進行期間實施臨時交通管制措施。屆時，經竹篙灣公路、欣澳道、神奇道及幻想道來往樂園、酒店及迪欣湖活動中心的行車時間，或因交通管制措施而增加約30分鐘。計劃前往香港迪士尼樂園度假區一帶的市民，應考慮盡量使用鐵路服務。

此外，由於此路段連接北大嶼山公路，因此需要來往香港迪士尼樂園度假區及香港國際機場的市民及旅客，亦有機會受北大嶼山公路的臨時交通管制措施影響，增加所需行車時間。

A press conference hosted by the Head of the National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong) (NGCO), Mr Yeung Tak-keung,was held jointly with representatives of relevant government departments and the Cycling Association of Hong Kong, China today (October 14) to announce details of the event and the relevant arrangements, including temporary traffic control measures, clearance arrangements at the boundary control point (BCP), and emergency response and rescue arrangements.

 The road cycling (men's individual) event this year is the only event that spans over Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao in the 15th NG, and a tripartitetest event was held last November. In addition, a pre-event comprehensive drill was conducted on September 30 and the process was generally smooth. The official race covers a total distance of 231.8 kilometres, comprising a 55.8km section in Hong Kong. The race will enter Hong Kong from the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) and go through the Hong Kong Port, North Lantau Highway and Penny's Bay Highway. The athletes will return after passing by Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and head back to Zhuhai via the HZMB and Hengqin.

 The race is scheduled to start at 9am on November 8, and is expected to conclude at 2.30pm. The event will feature 25 representative teams from the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao, with a total of 104 athletes competing. It is anticipated that the race convoy will enter the Hong Kong section around 10.20am and spend about one and a half hours in the Hong Kong section.

 To facilitate better viewing experience, a public viewing zone will be set up on the footpath of Fantasy Road located outside the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, which can accommodate a few hundreds of spectators. Members of the public may come to cheer up the athletes and enjoy the race there. Implementation of crowd management measures will be made by the Police subject to conditions in the areas. Members of the public are advised to take heed of instructions of the Police and the staff on site. As temporary traffic control measures will be implemented on the race route at the North Lantau Highway, members of the public should take the MTR to the Disneyland Resort station as far as possible to reach the designated viewing zone. The Guangdong competition region has commissioned the China Central Television as the host broadcaster to provide live webcast of the event. All rights-holding broadcasters, including the three local free television broadcasters and Radio Television Hong Kong, will be conferred the live signal.

 To facilitate the holding of the race, temporarily control measures will be implemented on the HZMB Hong Kong Port, the HZMB and some roads on that day. Relevant arrangements are set out as below:

(1) Clearance service arrangement

Travellers and drivers who plan to use the bridge on that day are advised to plan their trips in advance and pay attention to the traffic control arrangements within Zhuhai.

(2) Public transport arrangements

 Cross-boundary public transport services travelling on the HZMB between Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macao, including the HZMB shuttle bus (Gold Bus), cross-boundary coach and bus services of SkyPier Terminal Transfer Coach of Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA), will be suspended during the implementation of the temporary control on the HZMB Main Bridge and the HZMB Hong Kong Port on that day. As the roads within Zhuhai are still closed for the race until about 2.30pm, the Gold Bus from Hong Kong to Zhuhai is expected to provide limited service from 12.30pm to 1.30pm while the Gold Bus from Zhuhai to Hong Kong will resume service at 2.30pm. Meanwhile, Gold Bus services to/from Macao will resume at 12.30pm.

  In addition, during the temporary control period, local public transport services to and from the HZMB Hong Kong Port will implement temporary services adjustment, including airport bus A routes, shuttle bus B routes and Disneyland R routes. The A routes from the airport will not pass through the Hong Kong Port from 10am to 1pm and the A route from urban and New Territories to the airport will not pass through the Hong Kong Port from the first departure to 11.30am. The shuttle bus services B4 and B5 serving between Airport/Sunny Bay Station and HZMB Hong Kong port will be suspended during certain periods. Routes R8 and R33, serving between Disneyland and the Lantau Link Interchange and Tuen Mun Station will also be suspended for some periods. Meanwhile, to facilitate the smooth implementation of the event, Shun Long Road (both bounds) will be closed (see details under (3) below) and affected bus routes will be temporarily diverted. The bus companies will issue notices to inform affected passengers of the details of the above service adjustment.

 The Transport Department (TD) will notify affected operators of cross-boundary and local public transport services, while the Marine Department will liaise with cross-boundary ferry operators, to work out manpower and frequency arrangements. During the temporary control period, travellers should consider the use of land BCPs between Hong Kong and Shenzhen for their travel between Hong Kong and Zhuhai. They should also consider taking cross-boundary ferry services between Hong Kong and Macao.

 Booking for the time slot between 6am and noon for Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles will be suspended. Subject to on-site traffic management arrangements on the event day, motorists who have made reservations in the afternoon on that day will only be allowed to enter the Vehicle Clearance Plaza of the Hong Kong Port after the temporary traffic control measures are lifted (estimated to be after around 12.30pm).

 Regarding passenger bus services of SkyPier Terminal Transfer Coach of the HKIA, the services between the HKIA and Zhuhai and Macao Port, will be suspended during the temporary control period at the Hong Kong Port of the HZMB. The Airport Authority Hong Kong will maintain close communication with all service operators and continuously monitor the situation to implement timely adjustments as needed.

 In addition, the 15th NG road cycling (women's individual) event will be held on November 9. Though the race course will mainly be located in Zhuhai and will not affect the HZMB and clearance services at the port, some of the roads in Zhuhai will be closed due to the event. From 7.30am to 11.30am that day, only limited services for routes departing for Zhuhai will be provided by the Gold Bus. Members of the public are advised to avoid taking the Gold Bus to Zhuhai during the abovementioned periods. Moreover, some of the ferry services between Hong Kong and Zhuhai Jiuzhou Port will also be suspended on November 8 and 9.

(3) Road traffic control measures

 Temporary traffic control measures will be implemented on the North Lantau Highway and roads near the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort during the race period of Hong Kong section (exact time will depend on the actual progress of the race).

 Temporary traffic control measures will be implemented in the vicinity of the race route on the North Lantau Highway. The travel time to and from the airport via the North Lantau Highway is expected to increase by about 30 minutes. Members of the public and travellers who plan to travel to and from the airport should plan their trips in advance and allow sufficient travelling time. They are advised to use railway services, including the Airport Express, the Tung Chung line and the Disneyland Resort line, and avoid driving to the relevant area. Drivers who need to drive to the airport may consider using the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Tunnel.

 Temporary traffic control measures will be implemented on the race route near the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort during the race. Travelling time to and from the park, hotels and the Inspiration Lake Recreation Centre via Penny's Bay Highway, Sunny Bay Road, Magic Road and Fantasy Road may be increased by about 30 minutes due to the traffic control measures. Members of the public who plan to travel to the vicinity of the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort should consider using railway services as far as possible.

 In addition, as this road section connects to the North Lantau Highway, members of the public and travellers who need to travel between the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and the HKIA may also be affected by the temporary traffic control measures on the North Lantau Highway, and the travelling time required may be increased.

Shun Long Road (both bounds) will be closed starting from 6.30am and expected to reopen at about 2pm on that day after the related road section returns to normal. During the above road closure period, the TD will implement traffic diversion such that the original traffic of Shun Long Road (both bounds) will be diverted via Chek Lap Kok Island. The journey time is expected to increase by about 10 minutes. The bus companies will issue notices to inform passengers of the details of service adjustment.

 A spokesperson for the NGCO said as the NG is the country's highest-level event, this event has to meet stringent requirements in terms of the selection of race course and the organisational arrangements to ensure the safety of athletes. Relevant departments will work together to facilitate the special traffic and transportation arrangements to minimise the impact on the public and travellers who usually use the HZMB and other related road sections. Members of the public and travellers who need to travel to and from Zhuhai or Macao are urged to plan their itinerariesin advance, and use other control points and public transport as far as possible.The spokesperson thanked members of the public and travellers for their understanding, as well as the contributions of various organisations and departments to implementing the relevant arrangements."
