立法會十四題：支援戲院行業,2025-07-16 12:25,2025-07-16 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600313.htm,"​以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上陳沛良議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為近月本港多間戲院相繼結業，業界面對經營成本上升、串流平台競爭等挑戰，戲院結業潮恐會持續蔓延。另一方面，戲院作為電影的重要展示平台，以及市民消費及文娛的重要場所，行業的長遠發展亟待政府支援。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計過去五年每年戲院結業及開業的數目分別為何；

（二）有否統計目前全港18區各區戲院的以下資料：（i）戲院數目、（ii）可提供座位數目、（iii）每千名人口可享用的座位數目、（iv）銀幕數目，以及（v）平均票價；該等數據與五年前的數據的比較為何；

（三）針對「零／少戲院」的地區，政府會否參考早年做法，在個別出售土地的賣地條件中，加入設立電影院的規定，並訂明不得在營運電影院的首七年內更改電影院作其他用途；有否制訂措施增加戲院的供應；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（四）由文創產業發展處贊助並自二○二三年起舉辦的全港戲院日的以下資料：每年的（i）參與戲院數目、（ii）放映場次、（iii）‍入場觀眾人次、（iv）票房收入，以及（v）政府的資助金額；有否評估全港戲院日對支援戲院行業發展的成效；當局有否其他進一步措施支援戲院行業？

答覆：

主席：

就陳沛良議員的提問，我現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）截至二○二五年七月十日，全港共有52家電影院，較二○二○年（即五年前）減少九家（15%）。雖然近年結業的電影院數目有所增加，但亦有不同營運商先後接手經營。過去五年電影院結業及開業的數目以及平均票價詳見附件一。

目前，全港18區除黃大仙區外均有電影院。至於黃大仙區內早前結業的電影院已獲新營運商接手經營，將於七月中開業。二○二○年及二○二五年全港各區電影院、銀幕、座位及每千人口座位數目的比較載於附件二。

（三）過去兩年電影院面對多方面的挑戰，包括串流平台的興起、環球影業的不景氣、欠缺具市場號召力的電影、電影院租金和運作成本高昂、觀眾觀影和消費習慣的轉變等。此外，本港的電影市場和環球電影市場一樣，都在適應疫情過後所帶來的各種轉變與挑戰。儘管過去兩年有不少電影院結業，我們亦見到新電影院開業，把握商機。政府會繼續密切留意電影院業的困難和需要，並與業界保持緊密溝通。事實上，政府推行的「全港戲院日」（戲院日）和「10.1半價睇好戲」（半價睇好戲）正是針對電影院業的支援措施。此外，政府對電影業提供不同層面及性質的支援，包括人才培訓、推行多項電影製作支援計劃等等，亦令電影院業受惠。然而，電影院的供應及營運應由市場主導，政府現階段沒有計劃在土地拍賣時加入要求設立電影院的規定。

（四）戲院日和半價睇好戲為香港電影市道注入活力和信心，效果顯著。透過提供票價優惠，戲院日及半價睇好戲廣泛地向全港市民推廣電影文化，讓市民以相宜價格一家大小或與朋友到電影院享受觀影樂趣，培養他們到電影院欣賞電影的習慣，長遠拓展觀眾群，對電影業帶來裨益。政府及香港戲院商會都認為活動成效顯著，市民入場人次較同期大幅增加，並多次打破過往同期的入場人次和票房紀錄，為電影院業新增客源；而中小型或非主流電影都在活動中獲得更多觀眾的關注。此外，近期在票價優惠活動當日，有不少戲院的周邊食肆及商店也提供優惠，在進一步刺激觀眾進入電影院觀賞電影之餘，亦帶動周邊消費，讓電影院、電影業界，以致商戶及市民等多方受惠。戲院日和半價睇好戲自二○二三年推出後的參與戲院數目、放映場次、觀影人次、票房收入及基金資助額詳見附件三。

戲院日和半價睇好戲兩個票價優惠活動得到社會和電影市場的非常正面評價。政府會繼續透過文創產業發展處及電影發展基金支持香港電影提質、提量，從源頭出發，支持香港電影製作，期望以優質的香港電影為市場注入信心和活力。與此同時，政府將繼續透過資助不同項目及活動拓展本地觀眾群，培養市民到電影院觀賞電影的習慣，務求協助香港電影業、電影院業穩健發展。"
LCQ14: Supporting cinema industry,2025-07-16 12:25,2025-07-16 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600317.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Pui-leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

There are views that a number of cinemas in Hong Kong have closed down one after another in recent months and the industry is facing challenges such as rising operational costs and competition from streaming platforms, raising concerns that the wave of cinema closures may continue to spread. On the other hand, as cinemas serve as both an important platform for film exhibition and an important outlet for public consumption, culture and entertainment, the industry's long-term development is in dire need of government support. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the number of cinema closures and new openings in each of the past five years;

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the following information of the cinemas in each of the 18 districts across the territory at present: (i)‍ ‍the number of cinemas, (ii) ‍the seating capacity, (iii) ‍the number of seats per 1 000 population, (iv) ‍the number of screens, and (v) ‍the average ticket price; and how such figures compare with those from five years ago;

(3) as regards districts with ""zero/few cinemas"", whether the Government will, by making reference to past practices, consider including a cinema requirement in the land lease of individual land sale sites, stipulating that the cinema shall not be converted to other uses within the first seven years of operation; whether it has formulated measures to increase cinema supply; if it has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) of the following information on the Cinema Day, which has been sponsored by the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency and held since 2023: the annual (i) ‍number of participating cinemas, (ii) ‍number of screenings, (iii) ‍attendance, (iv)‍‍ ‍box-office takings, and (v)‍ ‍amount of government funding; whether it has assessed the effectiveness of the Cinema Day in supporting the development of the cinema industry; whether the authorities have other measures in place to further support the cinema industry?

Reply:

President,

Regarding the questions raised by the Hon Chan Pui-leung, my reply is as follows:

(1) and (2) As at July 10, 2025, there are 52 cinemas in Hong Kong, representing a decrease of nine cinemas (15 per cent) as compared to 2020 (five years ago). Although the number of cinema closures has increased in recent years, various operators have taken over some of the closed cinemas. The number of cinemas opened and closed, and the average ticket price over the past five years are set out in Annex 1.

Currently, there are cinemas in all the 18 districts except for Wong Tai Sin. The cinema closed earlier in Wong Tai Sin has been taken over by a new operator, and will be reopened in mid-July. A comparison of the number of cinemas, screens, seats and seats per 1000 population across all districts in Hong Kong in 2020 and 2025 is set out in Annex 2.

(3) Over the past two years, cinema industry has been encountering various challenges, including the rise of streaming platforms, downturn in global film industry, lack of blockbusters with strong appeal, high cinema rental and operational costs, and changes in audience viewing and consumption habits. In addition, both the Hong Kong and global film markets are still adapting to various post-pandemic changes and challenges. Despite the closure of some cinemas over the past two years, we have also seen new cinemas opening and seizing business opportunities. The Government will continue to closely monitor the difficulties and needs of the industry and maintain close communication with the trade. In fact, Cinema Day and 1st October Movie Fiesta: Half-Price Spectacular 2024 (1st October Movie Fiesta) launched by the Government aimed at supporting the cinema industry. Moreover, the Government has provided a range of support of different nature and levels, including nurturing talents and implementing multiple film production support schemes, which will also bring benefits to the cinema industry. However, the provision and operation of cinemas should be market-driven. At present, the Government has no plan to incorporate requirement for provision of cinema in the land sale condition of government land leases.

(4) Cinema Day and 1st October Movie Fiesta have brought confidence and impetus into Hong Kong's film market. By offering concessionary ticket prices, both initiatives promote film culture to the public, allowing families and friends to enjoy movies in cinemas at affordable prices, thereby cultivating the habit of cinema-going and building audience, which in turn benefits the film industry in the long term. Both the Government and the Hong Kong Theatres Association consider the events effective in bringing new audience to cinemas, with attendance figures significantly increased compared to the same period in previous years and breaking records in attendance and box office receipts. In addition, medium-to-small-scale and niche films have received more attention during the events. Furthermore, restaurants and shops near cinemas offered discounts at the day of the events, providing additional incentive of watching movies at cinemas and boosting consumption in surrounding shops. Overall speaking, Cinema Day and 1st October Movie Fiesta benefit the cinemas, film industry, businesses, and the general public. The number of participating cinemas, screenings, attendance, box office receipts, and amount of government funding of both initiatives are set out in Annex 3.

Both Cinema Day and 1st October Movie Fiesta have received positive feedbacks from the public and the film market. The Government will continue to support Hong Kong film industry by enhancing both quality and quantity of Hong Kong films through the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency and the Film Development Fund, with a view to bringing confidence and impetus into the market through quality Hong Kong films. Meanwhile, the Government will also continue to fund projects and activities that build local audience, to cultivate the habit of cinema-going and support the steady development of Hong Kong films and cinema industries."

立法會七題：對角行人過路處,2025-07-16 12:05,2025-07-16 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600339.htm,"​以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上梁子穎議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

政府去年於沙田沙角街與逸泰街交界及尖沙咀加拿分道與加連威老道交界兩個十字路口試行對角行人過路處。有將軍澳居民反映，將軍澳唐俊街與寶邑路交界十字路口（將軍澳十字路口）在不同時段的人流量極高，因此希望能在該十字路口試行及落實對角行人過路處，以便利當區居民往返港鐵將軍澳站。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否評估沙田及尖沙咀兩個對角行人過路處試點的成效並擬備報告；如有，報告的內容為何；如否，何時會進行有關評估；

（二）會否把將軍澳十字路口納入為對角行人過路處的新試點；如會，將於何時試行；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為將軍澳十字路口每邊有五至六條行車道，對角線距離長達40至50米，但交通燈循環時間與其他十字路口相若，令行人沒有足夠時間以對角方式完成過路，政府會否考慮重新調節該十字路口的交通燈號時間，以便試行對角行人過路處？

答覆：

主席：

對角行人過路處是運輸署推出的行人友善措施之一，在合適的路口讓行人可以選擇以較短距離橫過至路口的對角位置，從而節省步行時間並改善行人環境。就梁子穎議員的提問，經諮詢運輸署後，我現回覆如下：

（一）運輸署分別於去年上半年及下半年開始在沙田沙角街與逸泰街交界路口及尖沙咀加拿分道與加連威老道交界路口設立對角行人過路處作為試點，以測試及評估道路使用者使用有關路口的情況、過路處的安全性及其詳細設計安排，從而協助制定一套適用於香港的對角行人過路處設計標準及指引。據運輸署觀察所得，試驗計劃至今成效正面，行人橫過至路口對角所需時間減少，有關路口整體運作安全暢順。

（二）及（三）運輸署在評估個別路口是否適合加設對角行人過路處時，須照顧不同道路使用者的需要，並審慎考慮個別路口的交通特性（包括車流、人流、路口布局等因素），小心檢視路口的車輛通行能力及對附近一帶交通的影響，並探討不同的工程方案，以確立其可行性。就將軍澳唐俊街與寶邑路交界十字路口而言，由於該路口的對角距離較長，車流亦較為繁忙，增設對角行人過路處須於燈號運作上作較大的調整（如減少行車綠燈時間），方能讓行人有足夠時間安全完成對角過路的安排，這或會影響該路口及附近一帶交通。

為爭取進一步推展對角行人過路處，除上述兩個正在測試的路口試點之外，運輸署正積極評估在其他燈控路口加設對角行人過路處的可行性，當中包括社會各界和立法會／區議會議員在試驗計劃期間建議加設對角過路處的地點。運輸署預計可於今年下半年完成有關的評估，用以揀選新一批的合適路口。其後，運輸署會根據評估結果，審視選址的實地情況及工程規模，以便逐步規劃及開展相關的工程。"
LCQ7: Diagonal crossings,2025-07-16 12:05,2025-07-16 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600345.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Dennis Leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

Last year, the Government conducted trials of diagonal crossings at the two crossroads at the junction of Sha Kok Street and Yat Tai Street in Sha Tin and the junction of Carnarvon Road and Granville Road in Tsim Sha Tsui. Some Tseung Kwan O residents have relayed that as the pedestrian flows at the crossroads at the junction of Tong Chun Street and Po Yap Road in Tseung Kwan O (the Tseung Kwan O crossroads) during different periods are extremely high, they hope that diagonal crossings can be tried out and implemented at that crossroads, so as to facilitate the travelling of local residents to and from MTR Tseung Kwan O Station. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has assessed and prepared a report on the effectiveness of the two trials of diagonal crossings in Sha Tin and Tsim Sha Tsui; if so, of the contents of the report; if not, when it will conduct such an assessment;

(2) whether it will include the Tseung Kwan O crossroads as a new trial location for diagonal crossings; if so, when the trial will be conducted; if not, of the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views that while the Tseung Kwan O crossroads has five to six carriageways on each side with a diagonal distance of as long as 40 to 50 metres, its traffic signal cycle time is similar to that of other crossroads, leaving insufficient time for pedestrians to cross the road diagonally, whether the Government will consider readjusting the traffic signal timings at that crossroads, so as to facilitate a trial of diagonal crossings?

Reply:

President,

Diagonal crossing is one of the pedestrian-friendly crossing facilities introduced by the Transport Department (TD). Such facilities at appropriate junctions give pedestrians the choice to cross directly to a diagonal corner with shorter walking distance and time, thereby improving the walking environment. After consulting the TD, my consolidated response to the questions raised by the Hon Dennis Leung is as follows:

(1) To assess how road users navigate junctions and to evaluate the safety and detailed design of diagonal crossings, the TD has conducted trials at the junction of Sha Kok Street and Yat Tai Street in Sha Tin in the first half of 2024 and the junction of Carnarvon Road and Granville Road in Tsim Sha Tsui in the second half of 2024, which will help inform the development of design standards and guidelines for diagonal crossings that are appropriate for Hong Kong. As observed by the TD, the trial results have been positive so far. The trial junctions have been operating safely and smoothly, and reduced walking time for pedestrian crossing the junction diagonally.

(2)and (3) In assessing the suitability of diagonal crossing implementation at individual junctions, the TD has to address the needs of different road users, as well as carefully consider the traffic characteristics (including factors such as traffic flow, pedestrian flow and junction layout, etc.) of individual junctions, examine the vehicular capacity of the junctions and its impact on nearby traffic, and explore different engineering options to establish the feasibility. As regards the cross junction of Tong Chun Street and Po Yap Road in Tseung Kwan O, given the relatively long crossing distance and busy traffic flow of the junction, the implementation of diagonal crossing will require significant adjustments to traffic signal (such as reduction of traffic green time) so as to allow sufficient time for pedestrians to cross the road diagonally in a safe manner and this may affect the traffic at the junction and its vicinity.

In addition to the two trial junctions mentioned above, the TD is actively assessing the feasibility of diagonal crossing implementation at other signalised junctions, including locations suggested by the public and Legislative Council/District Council Members during the trial period, in order to further promote diagonal crossings. The TD anticipates that the assessment would be completed in the second half of this year with a view to selecting a new batch of suitable junctions for implementation. Thereafter, the TD will progressively plan and take forward the associated works in the light of the assessment results, the specific conditions of the sites and the complexity of the works involved."
立法會八題：鼓勵生育的措施,2025-07-16 12:00,2025-07-16 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600261.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上尚海龍議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

據報近年香港生育率持續低迷，二○二三年的總和生育率僅0.8，遠低於維持人口水平所需的2.1，對香港未來經濟發展、公共服務需求及勞動力結構構成深遠挑戰；而聯合國人口基金會發表的最新報告指出，全球生育率下降的主因為「生育自主權」不足，包括經濟壓力、性別不平等、缺乏伴侶支持及欠缺完善的生育健康服務等結構性障礙。有意見認為現時本港鼓勵生育的政策多聚焦提供短期經濟誘因（例如提供津貼和增加產假），卻未有針對上述結構性障礙制訂長遠策略。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否全面檢視現行鼓勵生育措施的成效，並針對現時市民面對的結構性經濟問題（例如高住屋成本、教育競爭和工作不穩定性）提出具突破性的政策；

（二）鑑於據報有調查指出，僅有兩成二的企業提供多於法例要求的家庭友善措施，當局會否考慮推行「家庭友善職場認證」，透過加強資助企業以提供更多彈性工作安排及育兒支援；

（三）當局會否考慮參考海外及內地的經驗，積極擴展託兒服務網絡，例如研究推出「鄰里託兒券計劃」、資助家長使用社區內合資格的私營託兒服務或善用商業區內的政府閒置用地或社區設施開設更多託兒服務中心；及

（四）當局會否考慮將容許各項人才入境計劃的「高才」、「優才」及「專才」可申請新生嬰兒獎勵金計劃，以鼓勵更多人才留港作出貢獻？

答覆：

主席：

生育議題涉及多個政策範疇及政策局，包括政務司副司長辦公室、勞工及福利局、教育局、民政及青年事務局、財經事務及庫務局、醫‍務衞生局和房屋局。相關政策局及政府部門的綜合回覆如下：

（一）生育是人生重要決定，牽涉不同考慮。生育率並非單靠政府政策可大幅提升。為鼓勵生育，政府不同政策局及部門已採取一系列措施。

在幼兒照顧方面，政府一直資助非政府機構為兒童提供多元化的日間照顧服務，以支援暫時未能照顧子女的家長，包括為零至三歲以下幼兒提供幼兒中心服務、課餘託管服務和「鄰里支援幼兒照顧計劃」等。為加強支援在職家庭育兒，由二○二四年起的三年內，社會福利署（社署）會分階段增設共11所資助獨立幼兒中心，服務名額會倍增至共約2000個。社署亦正分階段推展學前兒童課餘託管服務至全港各區，並把「鄰里支援幼兒照顧計劃」的服務名額增加至2500個，預計受惠兒童人數會增至25000人。政府亦推行在校課後託管服務計劃，聚焦支援有需要（尤其是來自單親家庭）的小學生在課後留校接受託管及學習支援，從而方便家長外出工作。二○二四／二五學年，超過120間覆蓋全港18區的小學參與計劃，提供約6000個名額。二○二五／二六學年我們會鼓勵更多學校參加計劃，名額不設上限。另一方面，政府不時檢視在職家庭津貼（職津）計劃。自二○二四年四月起，職津計劃劃一增加住戶及兒童津貼金額15%，所有領取職津的家庭均可受惠。職津計劃為育有子女的相關家庭提供額外津貼，增加職津金額有助進一步紓緩基層在職家庭的負擔。以一個育有兩名合資格兒童的四人住戶為例，可領取的職津最高金額已由原本每月4,200元增加至現時每月高達4,830元。

香港教育平等而多元，政府通過公營學校提供12年免費小學及中學教育，確保有足夠公營學位給予合資格在港接受教育的學生，讓他們不論背景，均能接受優質教育，並透過多元支援機制照顧學生個別差異，促進全人發展。這優勢從香港學生在國際研究及評估中的優異表現得到印證。「學生能力國際評估計劃」（PISA）2022的結果顯示，香港在教育平等方面表現突出，在高學術成就的國家或經濟體系中排名第二，反映家庭社經背景，包括父母的職業和教育程度，對香港學生的表現影響極少。這說明了在香港的教育體系下，各學校能給予不同社經背景的學生充足和適切的教育支援服務。有關結果確認香港教育制度的優越性，能為所有學生提供優質和平等的教育機會，促進社會流動。另外，政府自二○一七／一八學年起實施幼稚園教育計劃，目標是提供易於負擔的優質幼稚園教育，以及提高學童按其所需接受不同模式幼稚園教育的機會。現時約九成的半日制幼稚園課程免費，而全日制課程的學費也維持在低水平。有經濟需要的家庭可參與「幼稚園及幼兒中心學費減免計劃」，申請學費減免。現時，透過上述學費減免計劃，家長可獲得全額學費減免。

民政及青年事務局（民青局）一直支援家庭議會（議會）的工作，推動不同的宣傳項目和活動，向市民大眾宣揚關愛家庭的文化。民青局與議會於二○二四年十月推出為期五年的家庭教育推廣計劃（計劃），每年撥款800萬元，資助民間推行非牟利的家庭教育項目，照顧不同家庭的需要。計劃於二○二四至二五年度共批出12‍個項目。另一方面，議會致力在社區推廣更多元化和靈活的家庭友善僱傭措施，這些措施亦有助營造生育友好的環境。自二○二三至二四年度起，議會推出名為「家庭友善在職場」的宣傳短片，介紹本地公司推行的各類家庭友善僱傭措施，並邀請有關僱主及員工分享。短片所介紹的措施包括鼓勵餵哺母乳的安排、讓員工在暑假帶同子女上班、在家工作及彈性工作安排等。議會亦與香港電台合作推出電台節目，向聽眾宣傳不同類型的家庭友善僱傭措施。議會將繼續有關推廣工作。

在稅務措施方面，由二○二三／二四課稅年度起，子女基本免稅額及子女於出生課稅年度的額外免稅額已提高至13‍萬元。此外，由二○二四／二五課稅年度起，與二○二三年十月二十五日或之後出生的子女同住的納稅人如符合指明條件，居所貸款利息或住宅租金的扣除限額可由10萬元增加至12萬元，為期最多19個課稅年度。這些措施有助減輕納稅人供養子女的負擔。

就醫療服務而言，政府一直致力於支援輔助生育服務及鼓勵健康生育，協助有意生育人士。現時，醫院管理局（醫管局）轄下九間公立醫院設有輔助生育服務，當中瑪麗醫院、威爾斯親王醫院和廣華醫院提供體外受精服務。醫管局由二○二四至二五年度起，正逐步增加體外受精的輔助生育公營資助服務名額，由以往每年1100個逐步增加至二○二八至二九年度每年1800個，同時亦會加強相關專業人員的培訓。相關目標正逐步落實，其中醫管局已按計劃在二○二四至二五年度增設100個資助服務名額，並將在二○二五至二六年度再增加300個名額，以及在往後的三個年度各增加100個名額。此外，醫管局已於今年四月下旬將七種輔助生育藥物納入由藥物名冊內的自費藥物轉為專用藥物，病人在特定的臨床應用下獲處方這七款藥物，只須支付標準費用，減輕病人接受相關輔助生育藥物治療的經濟負擔。除公營輔助生育服務外，為減輕輔助生育服務開支帶來的經濟負擔，政府自二○二四至二五課税年度起在薪俸税和個人入息課税下，設立輔助生育服務開支扣除，以鼓勵有生育困難的夫婦尋求所需的醫療協助。與此同時，衞生署亦將重整母嬰健康及家庭計劃服務，分階段在母嬰健康院為生育年齡婦女新增孕前健康服務，並會檢視及調整現時由非政府機構提供的資助家庭計劃服務範疇，促進健康生育。另外，人類生殖科技管理局計劃在今年內取消供自用的配子和胚胎的法定儲存期限，讓市民因應自身健康及其他情況決定配子及胚胎儲存時間，更好地體現生育自主權。

在房屋方面，香港房屋委員會（房委會）已推出「家有初生優先配屋計劃」及「家有初生優先選樓計劃」，為公共租住房屋（公屋）及資助出售單位銷售計劃的家庭申請者提供誘因，以鼓勵生育。在公屋編配方面，房委會已於二○二四年四月一日起實施「家有初生優先配屋計劃」，凡有於二○二三年十月二十五日或以後出生而年滿一歲或以下的初生嬰兒的公屋家庭申請，均可獲縮減一年輪候時間。截至二○二五年六月底，已有約5000宗公屋申請在計劃下獲縮減一年輪候時間，當中約420宗已成功獲安排入住公屋。而在資助出售單位方面，房委會已由「出售居者其屋計劃（居屋）單位2024」（「居屋2024」）起，落實二○二三年《施政報告》公布推出的「家有初生優先選樓計劃」。在「居屋2024」新推售單位中，預留約四成單位作配額（即2900個單位），供參加「家有初生優先選樓計劃」和「家有長者優先選樓計劃」的合資格申請者攪珠和優先選樓。凡有嬰兒於二○二三年十月二十五‍日或以後出生的居屋家庭申請者，而其子女在申請截止日期時為三歲或以下，均符合申請資格。在「居屋2024」申請期內，房委會共收到約106000份申請表，其中約50000份屬家庭申請者。當中參加「家有長者優先選樓計劃」及「家有初生優先選樓計劃」的申請共有約19000份，佔家庭申請者約四成，其中有約800個申請者已通過「家有初生優先選樓計劃」成功購買單位。未能在「居屋2024」中成功選購單位的「家有初生優先選樓計劃」合資格家庭，只要他們的子女在日後推出的資助出售單位銷售計劃的申請截止日期時為三歲或以下，仍可參加「家有初生優先選樓計劃」而獲優先選樓。

（二）勞工處透過宣傳及推廣活動，推動僱主採納以僱員為本的良好人事管理方法及實施家庭友善僱傭措施，包括容許靈活工作安排、照顧員工家庭需要而給予特別假期批准，以及提供員工家庭生活相關的支援等。推行家庭友善僱傭措施讓員工能兼顧照顧家庭的需要，亦有助僱主招聘和挽留人手。考慮到企業的不同情況，以推動及鼓勵的方式讓企業靈活實行家庭友善僱傭措施較為合適。勞工處會繼續經不同途徑進行宣傳推廣，包括舉辦《好僱主約章》活動，推動有關工作。

（三）在託兒服務網絡方面，由二○二四年起的三年內，社署會分階段增設合共11所資助獨立幼兒中心。社署一直持續檢視幼兒中心服務的規劃，並會考慮幼兒照顧服務的整體情況及地區的個別因素，適時採取跟進措施，包括加強服務宣傳、調節設置中心的數目及服務名額分配等，以更適切地回應社區的服務需求。

就幼兒照顧設施規劃，政府已把按人口提供的服務規劃比率納入《香港規劃標準與準則》，為資助獨立幼兒中心在新發展或重建地區的規劃過程中，及早預留所需用地和空間。社署一直與相關政府部門保持密切聯絡，在公共屋邨發展或重建項目和市區重建項目中物色合適的用地，以提供幼兒照顧設施。此外，社署會盡量善用空置政府物業／處所及公共屋邨內的空置非住宅處所等，探討是否適合用作幼兒照顧設施；並會就私人機構開辦幼兒中心的註冊申請提供相關資訊和協助，並鼓勵私營機構為僱員提供幼兒照顧支援。

（四）政府在二○二三年《施政報告》公布，向合資格的父母，就每名於二○二三年十月二十五日起出生的嬰兒給予二萬元的現金獎勵，計劃為期三年。由二○二三年十月二十五日開始，父母在為嬰兒辦理出生登記及申領出世紙時，可同時提交獎勵金的申請。截至二○二五年六月底，政府共接獲49567宗合資格申請，並已向48984名申請人發放獎勵金，總發放金額約為9.79億元。政務司副司長辦公室正就新生嬰兒獎勵金計劃進行檢討，在檢討過程中會考慮社會上曾就計劃所提出的建議，包括應否涵蓋不同人才計劃的家庭。"
LCQ8: Measures to encourage childbirth,2025-07-16 12:00,2025-07-16 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600270.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Shang Hailong and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

 It has been reported that Hong Kong's fertility rate has remained persistently low in recent years, with the total fertility rate for 2023 standing at only 0.8, which is significantly below the replacement level of 2.1 required to maintain the population level. This situation presents profound challenges to Hong Kong's future economic development, public service demands and workforce structure. The latest report published by the United Nations Population Fund indicates that the primary cause of the global decline in fertility rates is insufficient ""reproductive autonomy"", which includes structural barriers such as economic pressure, gender inequality, lack of partner support and want of comprehensive reproductive health services. There are views that Hong Kong's current pro-natalist policies largely focus on providing short-term economic incentives (e.g. allowances and increased maternity leave) without formulating long-term strategies to address the aforementioned structural barriers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will conduct a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the existing pro-natalist measures, and propose ground-breaking policies to address the current structural economic issues faced by citizens (such as high housing costs, intense educational competition, and job instability);

(2) given that a survey has reportedly indicated that only 22 per cent of enterprises offer family-friendly measures beyond those required by law, whether the authorities will consider implementing a ""family-friendly workplace certification"" programme, through which enhanced subsidies would be provided to enterprises to offer more flexible working arrangements and childrearing support;

(3)whether the authorities will consider drawing on overseas and the Mainland experiences to actively expand the childcare service network, such as by exploring the introduction of a ""neighbourhood childcare voucher scheme"", subsidising parents to use qualified private childcare services within their communities, or making better use of idle government sites or community facilities in commercial areas to establish more childcare service centres; and

(4) whether the authorities will consider allowing ""top talent"", ""quality migrants"" and ""professionals"" admitted under various talent admission schemes to apply for the Newborn Baby Bonus scheme, with a view to encouraging more talent to stay in Hong Kong and contribute to its development?

Reply:

President,

  The issue of childbearing straddles across a number of policy areas and bureaux, including the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration's Office, the Labour and Welfare Bureau, the Education Bureau, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the Health Bureau and the Housing Bureau. A consolidated reply by relevant government bureaux and departments is as follows:

(1)Childbearing is a major life decision which involves different considerations. Fertility cannot be boosted substantially by Government's policies alone. Various government bureaux and departments have adopted a range of measures to encourage fertility.

  In respect of child care, the Government has been supporting parents who cannot take care of their children temporarily through subsidising NGOs to provide a variety of day child care services, including Child Care Centre (CCC) services for children aged from birth to under three, After School Care Programme and Neighbourhood Support Child Care Project (NSCCP). To strengthen support for working families in childbearing, the Social Welfare Department (SWD) is setting up 11 aided standalone CCCs in phases over the three years starting from 2024, doubling the total number of service places to reach around 2000. The SWD is also extending the After School Care Programme for pre-primary children to cover all districts in phases, and increasing the number of service places under the NSCCP to 2500 with the estimated number of beneficiaries increasing to 25000. The Government has also launched the School-based After School Care Service Scheme to provide focused support for students in need (particularly those from single-parent families) to stay in school after school hours for care and learning support, thereby allowing their parents to take up jobs. Over 120 primary schools covering 18 districts across the territory participated in the scheme in the 2024/25 school year, providing about 6 000 places. We will encourage more schools to participate in the scheme in the 2025/26 school year without imposing any quota. Meanwhile, the Government reviews the Working Family Allowance (WFA) Scheme from time to time. The rates of the household and child allowances under the WFA Scheme have been increased by 15 per cent across the board with effect from April 2024, benefiting all households receiving the WFA. The WFA Scheme provides additional allowances for relevant childbearing families, and increasing the rates of the WFA helps further alleviate the burden of grassroots working families. Taking a four-person household with two eligible children as an example, the maximum monthly WFA they may receive have increased from the original amount of $4,200 to $4,830 at present.

Hong Kong's education system values equity and diversity. The government provides 12 years' free primary and secondary education through public sector schools, and ensures the provision of sufficient public sector school places for students eligible for receiving education in Hong Kong. Regardless of students' backgrounds, all are given access to quality education. Diversified support mechanisms are in place to cater to individual differences and promote whole-person development. Our competitive edge is clearly reflected in the excellent performance of Hong Kong students in international studies and assessments. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022 results underscore Hong Kong's outstanding performance in educational equity. Hong Kong ranked second among countries or economies with high academic achievements, indicating that the family socio-economic status of Hong Kong students, including occupation and education level of their parents, had minimal bearing on their performance. This demonstrates that, under our education system, schools are able to provide ample and appropriate education support services for students with different socio-economic backgrounds. The results reaffirmed the merits of the Hong Kong education system in providing all students with quality and equal education opportunities, thereby facilitating social mobility. Besides, the Government has launched the Kindergarten Education Scheme since the 2017/18 school year with the objectives of providing good quality and highly affordable kindergarten education, and enhancing the accessibility of students to different modes of services that suit their specific needs. About 90 per cent of half-day kindergartens are currently free of charge, while the school fees for whole-day kindergartens are maintained at a low level. Families with financial needs may apply for fee remission under the Kindergarten and Child Care Centre Fee Remission Scheme (KCFRS). At present, parents can receive full level of fee remission under the KCFRS.

  The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) has been supporting the work of the Family Council (the Council) in promoting a culture of loving families to the general public through organising different publicity programmes and activities. In October 2024, the HYAB and the Council launched the five-year Funding Scheme on the Promotion of Family Education (the Scheme). With annual funding of $8 million, the Scheme subsidises non-profit-making community projects in promoting family education to meet the needs of different families. For the 2024-25 round of applications, a total of 12 projects have been approved. On the other hand, the Council has been encouraging the wider adoption of more diversified and flexible family-friendly employment practices (FFEPs) in the community. These measures will also help promote a childbearing-friendly environment. Since 2023-24, the Council has been launching promotional videos entitled ""Family-friendly Workplace"" featuring various FFEPs adopted by local companies with sharings by employers and employees. The FFEPs presented include breastfeeding-friendly arrangements, allowing employees to bring their children to work during summer vacation, work-from-home arrangement and flexible work hours, etc. The Council has also collaborated with the Radio Television Hong Kong to produce radio programmes to promulgate different FFEPs. The Council will continue the relevant promotion work.

  In terms of tax measures, the basic child allowance and the additional child allowance for each child born during the year of assessment (YA) have been raised to $130,000 starting from YA 2023/24. Moreover, starting from YA 2024/25, for taxpayers who live with their children born on or after October 25, 2023, and meet the prescribed conditions, the deduction ceiling for home loan interest or domestic rents may be raised from $100,000 to $120,000 for a maximum of 19 YAs. These measures help alleviate the financial burden of taxpayers from raising children.

  As regards healthcare services, the Government has been committed to supporting assisted reproductive (AR) services and promoting healthy fertility, to assist those who wish to have children. Currently, nine public hospitals under the Hospital Authority (HA) offer assisted reproductive services, among which Queen Mary Hospital, Prince of Wales Hospital, and Kwong Wah Hospital provide in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) services. The HA is gradually increasing the publicly subsidised service quotas of assisted reproductive services for IVF treatment starting from 2024-25, from the previous 1100 per year to 1800 per year in 2028-29, and in parallel enhancing the training for relevant professionals. Achievement of the relevant target is underway, where the HA provided 100 additional subsidised service quotas in 2024-25 as planned, and 300 more quotas will be in place in 2025-26, followed by an additional service quota of 100 places per year in the three years that follow. In addition, the HA repositioned seven AR drugs from self-financed items to special drugs in the HA Drug Formulary in late April this year, whereby patients are only required to pay standard fees if prescribed these seven drugs under specified clinical applications, reducing the financial burden on patients receiving the relevant AR drug therapies. Aside from public AR services, starting from the year of assessment 2024-25, the Government is providing tax deductions for expenses on AR services under salaries tax and personal assessment, to relieve the financial burden from the relevant expenditure and encourage couples faced with fertility difficulties to seek medical assistance as necessary. In the meantime, the Department of Health will also revamp maternal and child health and family planning services, providing new pre-pregnancy health services to reproductive age group women at the Maternal and Child Health Centres in phases, as well as review and adjust the scope of the subsidised family planning service currently provided by non-government organisations, to promote healthy fertility. Furthermore, the Council on Human Reproductive Technology plans to lift the statutory maximum storage periods of gametes and embryos for own use within this year, to allow the members of the public to make their own decisions on the storage duration of gametes and embryos depending on their health and other conditions, so as to better realise reproductive autonomy.

  In respect of housing, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has implemented the Families with Newborns Allocation Priority Scheme and the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme to encourage childbearing by giving incentives to family applicants of public rental housing (PRH) and subsidised sale flats (SSF) sale exercises. Regarding the allocation of PRH, the HA has implemented the Families with Newborns Allocation Priority Scheme since April 1, 2024. PRH family applications with babies born on or after October 25, 2023, and aged one or below are credited one year of waiting time. As at end-June 2025, about 5000 PRH applications have been credited one year of waiting time under the scheme, of which about 420 families have already been successfully housed to PRH. As for SSF, starting from the Sale of Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) Flats 2024 (HOS 2024), the HA has implemented the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme which was announced in the 2023 Policy Address. A quota of about 40 per cent of the new flats for sale (i.e. 2900 flats) under HOS2024 were set aside for eligible applicants under the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme and the Priority Scheme for Families with Elderly Members for balloting and priority flat selection. Family applicants of HOS with babies born or after October 25, 2023, are eligible if their children are aged three or below on the closing day of the application. During the application period of HOS 2024, the HA received a total of around 106000 applications. Among them, around 50000 were family applicants, of which around 19000 (i.e. about 40 per cent) applied under the Priority Scheme for Families with Elderly Members and Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme. Among these 19 000 applicants, 800 applicants have successfully purchased flats through the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme. If eligible families applying under the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme fail to purchase a flat under HOS 2024, they may still apply under the Scheme for priority flat selection as long as their children are aged three or below on the closing day of the application in subsequent SSF sale exercises.

(2)Through publicity and promotional activities, the Labour Department (LD) motivates employers to adopt employee-oriented good human resources management measures and implement family-friendly employment practices, including allowing flexible work arrangements, granting special leave approval to cater for family needs of employees and providing relevant support to employees' family life, etc. Implementing FFEPs enables employees to balance the needs of taking care of their family, and also helps employers recruit and retain staff. Considering the diverse circumstances of enterprises, it is more appropriate to adopt an approach that motivates and encourages enterprises to flexibly implement FFEPs. The LD will continue to take forward relevant work by launching publicity and promotion through various channels, including organising activities on the Good Employer Charter.

(3)As regards the network of child care services, the SWD is setting up 11 aided standalone CCCs in phases over the three years starting from 2024. The SWD has been continuously reviewing the service planning for CCCs and would consider the overall situations of child care services and the characteristics of individual districts so as to take follow-up measures in a timely manner, including enhancing service promotion, and adjusting the planned provision of CCCs and the distribution of service places, etc., to better meet the service demand of the community.

  Regarding the planning for child care facilities, the Government has incorporated the population-based planning ratios into the Hong Kong Planning Standards and Guidelines in respect of aided standalone CCCs, with a view to reserving necessary sites and space for these facilities early in the planning process of new and redeveloped areas. The SWD has been maintaining close contact with relevant departments to identify suitable sites in various development or redevelopment of public housing estates and urban renewal projects for the provision of child care facilities. In addition, the SWD will make the best use of vacant government accommodation/premises and vacant non-domestic premises in public housing estates to explore whether they are suitable for the use of child care facilities. The SWD will also provide relevant information and assistance to private organisations applying for registration to operate CCCs, and encourage private organisations to provide child care support for their employees.

(4)The Government announced in the 2023 Policy Address that a cash reward of $20,000 will be provided to eligible parents for each baby born from October 25, 2023, for a period of three years. Starting from October 25, 2023, parents can submit an application for the bonus at the same time when registering the birth of their baby and applying for a birth certificate. As of end-June 2025, a total of 49 567 qualified applications have been received, and the bonus has been distributed to 48984 applicants, at a total amount of approximately $979 million. The Office of the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration is carrying out a review of the Newborn Baby Bonus Scheme. In the review, suggestions which have been raised in the community, including whether to cover families under different talent schemes, will be considered."
立法會十八題：就業支援服務,2025-07-16 11:55,2025-07-16 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600279.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上顏汶羽議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

勞工處就業資訊及推廣計劃辦事處（該辦事處）負責推廣就業服務，通過提供就業資訊協助求職人士尋找工作，並幫助僱主招聘合適員工。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）該辦事處現行的人手編制詳情（包括職位數目、職級分布及全職與合約制員工比例）為何；二○二二年至二○二四‍年期間，（i）該辦事處的運作開支、（ii）舉辦的招聘會場數，以及（iii）處理的職位空缺數目為何，並按年份及行業類別（例如零售、建造業、服務業等）列出分項資料；

（二）二○二二年至二○二四年期間，經該辦事處轉介並成功獲聘的就業個案（成功配對個案）的數目及其佔該辦事處所處理的職位空缺數目的百分比為何，並按求職者的年齡、性別、學歷和群體（例如少數族裔或殘疾人士），以及獲聘職位的行業分類列出；有否就成功配對個案訂定清晰的定義及準則（例如須持續受僱三個月或以上）；

（三）勞工處有否為該辦事處的工作制訂績效指標，例如招聘會參與率、職位空缺填補率或求職者滿意度；若有，詳情（包括主要指標，以及在二○二二年至二○二四年期間該等指標的達標情況）為何；若否，原因為何；

（四）有否計劃全面檢討該辦事處的服務成效，以優化支援弱勢勞工（包括低技術工人、婦女、少數族裔、中年人士等）就業的措施；若有，詳情（包括檢討的時間表、範圍及目標）；若否，原因為何，以及會否進行相關檢討；

（五）會否考慮加強與企業、社會組織及非政府機構的合作，建立「弱勢勞工就業支援平台」，鼓勵企業提供適合弱勢勞工的實習及長期就業機會；若會，詳情（包括計劃內容、實施時間表、資助或鼓勵企業的措施，以及預期成效）；若否，原因為何，以及有否其他替代措施；及

（六）會否參考勞工處按行業設立就業中心的做法（例如飲食業招聘中心、零售業招聘中心及建造業招聘中心），將部分地區的就業中心改為專以婦女、長者、少數族裔為支援對象的一站式就業支援中心，以提升該等中心的成效？

答覆：

主席：

勞工處為求職人士提供多元化及免費的就業服務，鼓勵及協助他們投入就業市場。勞工處就業資訊及推廣科轄下的就業資訊及推廣計劃辦事處（辦事處）負責舉辦大型招聘會及籌劃宣傳活動，推廣勞工處的就業服務及相關資訊。辦事處亦積極聯繫僱主，搜羅各行業的職位空缺，協助僱主招聘員工，促進就業資訊流通。

就議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）二○二二／二三至二○二四／二五年度，辦事處的人手編制按職系劃分的分項數字載於附件一。同期，辦事處的運作開支（不包括薪酬開支）每年分別為502萬元、907萬元及894萬元。由於2019冠狀病毒病疫情，二○二二年部分活動未能舉辦，因此運作開支較低。

二○二二年至二○二四年，辦事處全年分別舉辦13場、17場及18場大型招聘會，分別提供23 594個、36 870個及32 900個職位空缺，讓求職人士即場向僱主提出職位申請。由於2019冠狀病毒病疫情，二○二二年舉辦大型招聘會的場次及錄得的職位空缺較少。相關職位空缺按行業劃分的分項數字載於附件二。

（二）勞工處舉辦的大型招聘會提供方便的平台，供僱主及求職人士直接會面。求職人士除可即場申請職位及面試外，亦可直接向僱主了解行業的發展、公司文化及職位要求等。同時，求職人士可在招聘會使用勞工處的就業諮詢服務，以及獲取各項就業計劃的資訊。

二○二二年至二○二四年，全年分別約有6 600名、26 500名及32 600名求職人士到訪辦事處舉辦的大型招聘會。由於2019冠狀病毒病疫情，二○二二年到訪大型招聘會的求職人數較低。根據勞工處於招聘會後收回的僱主問卷回覆，二○二二年至二○二四年每年分別約有1 300名、1 900名及2 000名求職人士在招聘會後一個月內獲聘。勞工處沒有備存到訪招聘會及在招聘會後獲聘人士的分項數字。

（三）及（四）勞工處不時在各區舉辦大型招聘會，並在各就業中心舉辦地區性專題招聘會，包括為少數族裔人士舉辦共融招聘會、為中高齡求職人士（包括婦女）舉辦兼職或專題招聘會。

整體而言，僱主、求職人士和相關持份者對招聘會的需求殷切，參與招聘會的僱主及求職人士對招聘會的反應十分良好。由於職位空缺的數目、招聘成功率等受經濟、勞工市場、求職人士個人情況等因素影響，為辦事處或其籌辦的大型招聘會制定「關鍵績效指標」並不合適。

勞工處會繼續密切監察經濟及就業市場的變化，適時檢討各項就業服務的成效，並推出適切的優化措施。

（五）及（六）勞工處的十所就業中心，為求職人士提供綜合的就業服務。求職人士除可使用中心的就業轉介服務外，亦可使用中心的設施，包括空缺搜尋終端機、供撰寫履歷表的文書處理電腦及就業資訊角等。中心的就業主任亦與求職人士會面，提供個人化的就業諮詢服務，並按求職人士的需要和意願，建議他們參加合適的就業計劃，或報讀培訓╱再培訓課程，提升就業能力及增加獲聘機會。所有中心現時均為中高齡人士（包括婦女）及少數族裔人士提供專項服務，例如為50歲或以上人士提供優先就業服務及為少數族裔安排傳譯服務等。

此外，勞工處推行各項就業計劃，包括「展翅青年就業計劃」、「再就業津貼試行計劃」、「中高齡就業計劃」及「多元種族就業計劃」，支援及促進青年、中高齡人士（包括婦女）及少數族裔人士就業。勞工處與相關團體保持協作，包括委聘非政府機構，為參加者提供就業支援等，共同推行就業計劃。

就業中心不但提供綜合服務，同時也與相關團體協作推行就業計劃。這種模式行之有效，可全面及靈活地切合不同類別（包括婦女、長者及少數族裔人士等）求職人士的需要。因此，勞工處目前沒有計劃另行設立其他就業支援平台，或為特定群組新設專用的就業支援中心。"
LCQ18: Employment support services,2025-07-16 11:55,2025-07-16 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600290.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Ngan Man-yu and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

  The Employment Information and Promotion Programme Office (EIPPO) of the Labour Department (LD) is responsible for promoting employment services, assisting job-seekers in finding jobs through the provision of employment information, and helping employers recruit suitable staff. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the details of EIPPO's existing staffing establishment (including the number of posts, rank distribution and the ratio of full-time to contract staff); between 2022 and 2024, (i) the operating expenses of EIPPO, (ii) the number of job fairs organised, and (iii) the number of job vacancies processed, together with a breakdown by year and industry type (e.g. retail, construction and service);

(2) of the number of successful placements referred by the EIPPO (""successful job matching"") between 2022 and 2024 and its percentage in the total number of job vacancies processed by the EIPPO, together with a breakdown by the age, sex, academic qualification and group (e.g. ethnic minorities or persons with disabilities) of job seekers, and the industry of the placement; whether it has laid down clear definitions and criteria for successful job matching (e.g. staying in employment for three months or more);

(3) whether the LD has formulated performance indicators for the EIPPO's work, such as participation rates at job fairs, vacancy filling rates or job seeker satisfaction levels; if so, of the details (including the key indicators and their attainment between 2022 and 2024); if not, the reasons for that;

President,

  The Labour Department (LD) provides diversified and free employment services to job-seekers to encourage and assist them in entering the labour market. The Employment Information and Promotion Programme Office (EIPPO) under the Employment Information and Promotion Division of the LD is responsible for holding large-scale job fairs and organising publicity projects to promote the LD's employment services and related information. The EIPPO also actively liaises with employers to canvass job vacancies from different industries with a view to assisting employers in recruiting employees and expediting the dissemination of employment information.

  The reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1)The breakdown of the EIPPO's staff establishment by grade from 2022-23 to 2024-25 is at Annex 1. The EIPPO's annual operational expenses (excluding staff cost) during the same period was $5.02 million, $9.07 million and $8.94 million respectively. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some activities could not be organised in 2022, resulting in lower operational expenses for the year.

  From 2022 to 2024, the EIPPO organised 13, 17 and 18 large-scale job fairs each year, offering 23 594, 36 870 and 32 900 job vacancies respectively for job-seekers to submit job applications to employers on the spot. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of large-scale job fairs organised and job vacancies recorded in 2022 were lower. A breakdown of the relevant job vacancies by industry is at Annex 2.

(2)The LD organises large-scale job fairs to provide a convenient platform for employers and job seekers to meet face-to-face. In addition to applying for jobs and attending interviews on the spot, job seekers can learn directly from employers about trade development, company culture, job requirements, etc. At the same time, they can make use of the LD's consultation services during job fairs and obtain information on various employment programmes.

  From 2022 to 2024, about 6 600, 26 500 and 32 600 job seekers attended the large-scale job fairs organised by the EIPPO each year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of job seekers visiting the large-scale job fairs was lower in 2022. Based on the questionnaire responses collected by the LD from employers after the job fairs, from 2022 to 2024, approximately 1 300, 1 900 and 2 000 job seekers were respectively employed within one month after the job fairs each year. The LD does not maintain breakdowns of the job fair visitors or individuals employed after the job fairs.

(3) and (4)The LD from time to time organises large-scale job fairs across the territory and stages district-based thematic job fairs at its job centres, including inclusive job fairs for ethnic minorities, and part-time or thematic job fairs targeting elderly and middle-aged job seekers (including women).

  Overall, employers, job seekers and relevant stakeholders have strong demand for job fairs. Participating employers and job seekers respond very favourably to the events. As the number of job vacancies, success rate of recruitment, etc., may be affected by factors such as the economy, labour market situation and personal circumstances of job seekers, it is inappropriate to set Key Performance Indicators for the EIPPO or the large-scale job fairs it organises.

  The LD will continue to closely monitor changes in the economy and employment market, conduct timely review on the effectiveness of various employment services, and implement appropriate enhancement measures.

(5) and (6)The LD's ten job centres provide integrated employment services to job seekers. Apart from job referral service, job seekers can also use the facilities of the job centres, including vacancy search terminals, computers with word processing function for preparing resume, employment information corners, etc. Employment officers of the centres may also meet with job seekers to provide them with personalised employment advisory service, and based on their needs and preferences, recommend them to join suitable employment programmes or to enroll in training/retraining courses so as to enhance their employability and employment opportunities. All job centres also provide dedicated services for elderly and middle-aged persons (including women), and ethnic minorities, such as priority employment services for those aged 50 or above, and arrangement of interpretation services for ethnic minority job seekers.

  Additionally, the LD implements various employment programmes including Youth Employment and Training Programme, Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme, Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged and Racial Diversity Employment Programme to support and facilitate the employment of young people, elderly and middle-aged persons (including women) as well as ethnic minorities. The LD collaborates with relevant groups, including engaging non-governmental organisations to provide employment support to participants, etc., to jointly implement employment programmes.

  Apart from offering integrated employment services, job centres also collaborate with relevant groups in implementing employment programmes. Proven to be effective, this modus operandi can comprehensively and flexibly meet the needs of different groups of job seekers (including women, older persons and ethnic minorities, etc.). As such, the LD currently has no plan to set up other employment support platform, or new employment support centres for specific groups of job seekers."
立法會九題：智能回收系統先導計劃,2025-07-16 11:42,2025-07-16 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600262.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上盧偉國議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

環境保護署（環保署）從二○二二年年中開始擴展「智能回收系統先導計劃」（先導計劃），並由該年底起在部分「回收環保站」和「回收便利點」開始逐步配備智能回收箱和自動禮品兌換機。智能回收箱亦於二○二三年三月起陸續進駐屋邨、屋苑、鄉村、商場、大學和政府場地等，先導計劃的應用點已由計劃開展初期的四個增加至現時超過800個。此外，智能回收箱可24小時全天候運作，並設有感應器讓回收物收集服務承辦商（承辦商）可監測回收箱的滿溢情況。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有市民反映他們不時發現智能回收箱滿溢，雖有作出投訴但有關方面的跟進緩慢，以致他們往往被迫將回收物品帶回家中，減低其回收意欲，自二○二三年三月至今，環保署每月接獲有關投訴的宗數、完成跟進的宗數，以及處理每宗投訴所需的平均時間分別為何；

（二）當局有否訂立恆常監管機制，對承辦商處理有關智能回收箱滿溢情況的投訴，以至一般服務表現作定期評估和檢討，並要求承辦商在限定時間內作出改善；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）隨着先導計劃的智能回收箱應用點陸續增加，當局會否同時增撥資源以加強巡視和抽查，從而確保整個智能回收系統發揮應有的作用；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

環境保護署（環保署）於二○二○年第四季推出「智能回收系統先導計劃」（先導計劃），分階段測試不同的智能回收設備，包括智能回收箱、智能磅和自動禮物兌換機。截至二○二五年六月底，除在全線「綠在區區」回收設施設置智能磅外，先導計劃在全港不同地點，包括「綠在區區」設施、公共屋邨、私人屋苑、鄉村、商場、大學和政府場地等，試驗設置159套智能回收箱，提供自助回收服務。

就盧偉國議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）各場地設置的智能回收箱一般由有關處所的物業管理（物管）公司或清潔公司負責清理，以及安排回收商到場收集和回收。

智能回收箱配備重量傳感器和容量水平感應器，並設有兩重提示機制，當收集到的回收物接近容量上限八成時，系統會自動向有關場地的工作人員發出訊息。當達至滿載時，系統會再次提醒物管及／或清潔承辦商等以便即時處理，物管公司一般都會定期或在收到訊息後短時間內清理回收物。環保署亦會透過大數據平台進行監察，適時作出跟進，數據顯示智能回收箱因滿載而暫停使用的時間，佔整體運作時間約7%。此外，大多數設置智能回收箱的處所亦同時設有傳統回收桶，讓市民可選擇在智能回收箱滿載時，把回收物放進回收桶。

二○二三年三月至二○二五年六月底，環保署收到有關智能回收箱滿溢的投訴宗數見下表。每次收到投訴後，環保署會即時跟進，要求有關的物管公司或清潔承辦商盡快清空智能回收箱，重啓其功能。環保署會持續監察各場地智能回收箱的運作，按需要與有關處所的物管公司商討，適時調整清理回收物的安排。

LCQ9: Pilot Programme on Smart Recycling Systems,2025-07-16 11:40,2025-07-16 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600268.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Lo Wai-kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

 The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has extended the Pilot Programme on Smart Recycling Systems (the Pilot Programme) starting from mid-2022 and gradually installed smart recycling bins and gift redemption units in some Recycling Stations and Recycling Stores since the end of that year. Starting from March 2023, smart recycling bins have also been progressively set up in housing estates, villages, shopping malls, universities, government venues, etc. The number of application points under the Pilot Programme has been increased from four locations in the initial phase to more than 800 locations at present. In addition, smart recycling bins support 24-hour operation and are equipped with sensors to enable recyclables collection service contractors (the contractors) to monitor the overflowing of recycling bins. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that some members of the public have relayed that they find from time to time that the smart recycling bins are overflowing, and despite their complaints, the follow-up actions taken by the authorities concerned have been slow, and they are often forced to take the recyclable items back home and thus reducing their incentives for recycling, of the respective numbers of such complaints received, number of cases with follow-up actions completed and average time taken to handle a complaint by the EPD in each month since March 2023;

(2) whether the authorities have put in place a regular monitoring mechanism to assess and review the contractors' handling of complaints about the overflowing of smart recycling bins as well as their general service performance, and require the contractors to make improvements within a specified period of time; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) with the gradual increase in the number of smart recycling bins application points under the Pilot Programme, whether the authorities will allocate additional resources at the same time to step up inspections and random checks, thereby ensuring that the smart recycling systems can serve their functions; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) launched the Pilot Programme on Smart Recycling Systems (the Pilot Programme) in the fourth quarter of 2020, to test different smart recycling devices in phases, including smart recycling bins, smart balances and gift redemption units. As at end-June 2025, in addition to installing smart balances at all GREEN@COMMUNITY recycling facilities, the Pilot Programme has installed 159 sets of smart recycling bins at different locations across Hong Kong for testing, including GREEN@COMMUNITY facilities, public rental housing estates, private housing estates, villages, shopping malls, universities and government venues, for providing self-service recycling.

 The reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Lo Wai-kwok is as follows:

(1) The property management companies or cleaning companies of the premises concerned are responsible for the clearance of the smart recycling bins set up at respective locations, as well as arranging recyclers for collection and recycling of recyclables.

Smart recycling bins are equipped with weight sensors and fill level sensors, featuring a dual alert mechanism. When the collected recyclables approach 80 per cent of the bin capacity limit, the system will automatically send a message to the relevant site staff of the venue. When a bin reaches its full capacity, the system will remind the property management company and/or cleaning contractor again for immediate action. Property management companies usually clear the collected recyclables regularly or shortly after receiving alert messages. The EPD also monitors the situation through the big data platform for timely follow-up actions. Data shows that the time which smart recycling bins was temporarily suspended due to overfilled bins accounts for about 7 per cent of the overall operating time of smart recycling bins. In addition, most premises with smart recycling bins are equipped with conventional recycling bins at the same time, which allow the public to place recyclables in these bins when the smart recycling bins are full.

From March 2023 to end-June 2025, the number of complaints received by the EPD regarding overfilled smart recycling bins are provided in the table below. Upon receipt of each complaint, the EPD would follow up immediately and request the concerned property management company or cleaning contractor to empty the smart recycling bin and resume its functions as soon as possible. The EPD will continue to monitor the operation of smart recycling bins at all locations, and liaise with the concerned property management companies as needed for timely adjustments to the arrangements for clearance of recyclables.

(2) As mentioned above, smart recycling bins are equipped with weight sensors and fill level sensors, featuring a dual alert mechanism. When the collected recyclables approach 80 per cent of the bin capacity limit, the system will automatically send a message to the relevant site staff of the venue, who should arrange clearance as soon as possible upon receiving the message. We will review the arrangements for clearance of smart recycling bins and explore ways to further enhance clearance efficiency. In addition, we are arranging to test the addition of a compression function in smart recycling bins to enhance the recycling capacity so as to reduce the frequency of clearance required and further reduce the downtime of the bins due to being full, thereby improving the service quality.

(3) The EPD's service contracts require the contractors of smart recycling bins to provide operational monitoring data and arrange staff to conduct regular inspections to ensure proper operation of the devices. The EPD will also continue to monitor the usage of smart recycling bins and conduct inspections and spot checks from time to time to ensure that the contractors' services meet the contract requirements. We will review the contract requirements and strengthen the performance indicators on maintenance services in the new contracts to enhance efficiency. With the increase in the number of application points, the EPD will deploy resources to step up inspections based on the actual situation, so that the entire smart recycling system can operate at its optimal level.

 On the other hand, to further enhance the operation and services of smart recycling devices, the EPD is actively preparing for introducing a new feature on displaying the real-time recycling status of smart recycling bins in the GREEN$ mobile app and the Hong Kong Waste Reduction Website, with a view to facilitating the public to plan for their recycling activities. This new feature is expected to be launched by the end of 2025."

ICAC Complaints Committee annual report tabled in LegCo,2025-07-16 11:35,2025-07-16 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600249.htm,"The 2024 Annual Report of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) Complaints Committee was tabled in the Legislative Council today (July 16). The report gives a summary of the Committee's work in 2024.

The Committee is tasked with the responsibility of monitoring the handling of non-criminal complaints against the ICAC and its officers. The Committee takes an independent view on the ICAC's investigation findings on the complaints received, reviews the ICAC's procedures which may lead to complaints, and makes recommendations for improvement.

In 2024, the Committee received 13 complaints involving 53 allegations against the ICAC or its officers which required full investigations. Among the allegations registered in 2024, 92 per cent were related to neglect of duties by ICAC officers, 6 per cent to misconduct matters and 2 per cent to abuse of power. 

The ICAC submits investigation reports to the Committee after conducting full investigations on complaint cases. During 2024, the Committee considered the investigation reports of 17 complaint cases including 13 cases received in 2024 and four cases received in 2023 for which the related investigation was completed in 2024. These complaints contained a total of 66 allegations in which one allegation involving one ICAC officer was found to be substantiated. In this year, the Committee also considered and endorsed six assessment reports submitted by the ICAC for complaints which did not warrant a full investigation. Preliminary assessments showed that the six cases were irrational complaints or had already been dealt with during the court trial with a decision made, and the Committee agreed that no further investigative actions should be taken.

After a careful examination of the issues identified in the investigation reports considered during 2024, the ICAC has strengthened training programmes for frontline officers to enhance their vigilance and professionalism when discharging their duties.

The annual report of the Committee is available on the Administration Wing's website (www.admwing.gov.hk/eng/links/icac.htm) and also at the ICAC's regional offices."
立法會十六題：協助殘疾人士出行的流動應用程式,2025-07-16 11:23,2025-07-16 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600269.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上林筱魯議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

關於協助殘疾人士出行的流動應用程式，政府可否告知本會：

（一）現時涉及資助軟件及應用程式開發的政府資助計劃中，有哪些獲資助項目與協助殘疾人士無障礙出行相關（以表列出）；

（二）政府有何計劃（例如透過資助），整合、增強及連結現有協助殘疾人士無障礙出行的流動應用程式，以使資源用得其所及令該等應用程式更有效為殘疾人士服務；及

（三）鑑於地政總署自二○二○年起研發三維數碼地圖，當中功能包括為有不同出行需要的人士提供無障礙路線規劃，政府如何推廣公私營機構善用該數碼地圖，並找出未完善的通行地點，以為日後改善及更新有關軟硬件（例如相關流動應用程式及無障礙設施）提供基礎？

答覆：

主席：

政府致力為有需要的殘疾人士提供適切的支援和協助，以利便殘疾人士出行，幫助他們全面融入社會。就議員的提問，經諮詢相關政策局，我綜合答覆如下：

（一）政府設立的智慧交通基金和社會創新及創業發展基金均有為協助殘疾人士無障礙出行的項目提供資助，相關項目資料分別載於附件一及二。

（二）數字政策辦公室就政府開發的流動應用程式已發布《流動應用程式實務指南》，要求各政策局／部門（局／部門）在推出流動應用程式後須作定期檢討，並以具成本效益的方式更新及整合現有的流動應用程式。

舉例說，地政總署於二○一六年推出專為視障人士而設的手機應用程式「香港有聲地圖」，以語音讀出地圖上附近的資訊，視障人士亦可利用手機的語音功能輸入所需指令，應用程式可隨即讀出相關結果。為善用資源，地政總署計劃將「香港有聲地圖」的相關功能整合至該署管理的另一地圖應用程式「地理資訊地圖」內。隨著「智方便」小程序平台於今年內推出，各局／部門亦必須優先考慮將流動應用程式遷移或整合主要功能於「智方便」平台上，令市民可以便捷地使用所需的應用服務，無須額外下載安裝應用程式，以加強政府流動應用程式的整合。

此外，二○二一年發展局在多個非政府機構、港鐵公司及九龍東地標式購物商場的支持下，開發了「為視障人士／有需要人士設計的智慧出行導航工具」概念驗證，提供無障礙導航體驗。該工具利用室內地圖，實現室內外無縫導航，幫助使用者輕鬆瀏覽環境並互動，提高他們的獨立性和移動能力。這項功能於二○二三年一月以「暢行助手」在「我的九龍東」手機應用程式中推出。發展局會繼續探討將此概念擴展至更多地區，讓有需要人士出行時能更自主自在。

運輸署亦於二○二四年四月起，因應平等機會委員會就提升香港整體通達程度的建議，加強流動應用程式「香港出行易」無障礙路線的功能，將無障礙路線選項由步行模式擴展至公共交通工具模式。當市民選擇以公共交通工具出行時，「香港出行易」可規劃視覺輔助路線或行動輔助路線，讓市民掌握前往車站沿途的無障礙通道（例如升降機、斜道、天橋的位置），以便殘疾人士可以更有效規劃行程，自主出行。

此外，香港天文台（天文台）多年來一直積極響應及支持無障礙網頁設計，由天文台內部研發的流動應用程式「我的天文台」亦已採用無障礙網頁設計準則，支援讀屏軟件、圖片說明文字及大小字體選擇等功能，方便各界人士（包括殘疾人士）在出行前瀏覽「我的天文台」，了解最新的天氣情況。天文台會繼續為流動應用程式加入無障礙功能，進一步加強天氣服務。

（三）地政總署及發展局空間數據辦事處一直經由不同渠道（例如講座及工作坊）向公私營機構推廣三維數碼地圖應用，闡釋其帶來的發展機遇。作為三維數碼地圖的重要組成部分，三維行人道路網匯集豐富路徑資訊，例如道路名稱、坡度、長度、沿途障礙物分佈及公共升降機開放時間，並整合政府設施入口的輪椅通行資訊及公共升降機數據，為不同出行需要人士提供無障礙路線規劃。地政總署及發展局空間數據辦事處會持續與各持份者（包括社福機構及服務殘疾人士的組織）溝通，因應持份者的需要聯絡相關公私營機構，促進跨機構資訊交流與協作，共同優化三維行人道路網，提升公共出行的便捷性。"
LCQ16: Mobile applications to assist with travel for persons with disabilities,2025-07-16 11:23,2025-07-16 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600273.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Andrew Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

 Regarding mobile applications to assist with travel for persons with disabilities (PWDs), will the Government inform this Council:

(1) which funded projects under the current government funding schemes for software and application development are related to assistance with barrier-free travel for PWDs (set out in a table);

(2) of the Government's plans (e.g. provision of funding support) in place to integrate, enhance and link up existing mobile applications that assist with barrier-free travel for PWDs, so as to optimise the use of resources and enable such applications to more effectively serve PWDs; and

(3) given that since 2020 the Lands Department has been developing a set of 3D Digital Map with functions including provision of barrier-‍free route planning for people with different commuting needs, how the Government promotes the best use of such digital map among the public and private sectors and identifies access points in need of improvement, so as to lay down a foundation for future improvement and update of the relevant software and hardware (e.g. the relevant mobile applications and barrier-free facilities)?

Reply:

President,

 The Government is committed to providing appropriate support and assistance to persons with disabilities in need so as to facilitate their travel and help them fully integrate into the community. Having consulted the relevant bureaux, I set out below a consolidated reply to the Member's question –

(1) Both the Smart Traffic Fund and the Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Fund set up by the Government have provided funding for projects that assist barrier-free travel for persons with disabilities. Information on the relevant projects is at Annexes 1 and 2 respectively.

(2) Regarding the mobile applications developed by the Government, the Digital Policy Office has promulgated the ""Practice Guide for Developing Mobile Apps"", requiring bureaux/departments (B/Ds) to conduct regular reviews after launching mobile applications, and to update and consolidate existing mobile applications in a cost-effective manner.

 For instance, in 2016, the Lands Department (LandsD) launched a mobile application ""VoiceMapHK"", which is specifically designed for the visually impaired, providing audio output that reads out information about nearby locations on the map. The visually impaired can also make use of the voice function of their mobile phones to issue commands, and the application will respond by reading out the corresponding results. To optimise the use of resources, the LandsD plans to integrate the functionalities of the ""VoiceMapHK"" into the GeoInfo Map, another map application under its management. With the launch of the ""iAM Smart"" mini-program platform later this year, all B/Ds must consider to prioritise migrating their mobile applications or integrating the core functions into the ""iAM Smart"" platform, so that members of the public can easily access the required application services without the need to download additional applications, thereby enhancing the consolidation of Government mobile applications.

 In addition, in 2021, the Development Bureau (DEVB), with the support of various non-governmental organisations, the MTR Corporation Limited and some iconic shopping malls in Kowloon East, developed a ""Smart Navigation Tool for The Visually Impaired/People in Need"" Proof-of-Concept, providing barrier-free navigation experience. This tool utilises indoor maps to provide indoor and outdoor seamless navigation, which helps users easily navigate and interact with the environment, and increases their independence and mobility. In January 2023, this tool was incorporated into the ""MyKE"" mobile application as the ""Walking Assistant"" function. The DEVB will continue to explore scaling up this Proof-of-Concept to cover more areas, so as to enable those in need to commute more freely.

 In response to the recommendations of the Equal Opportunities Commission on enhancing the overall accessibility of Hong Kong, the Transport Department has also enhanced the function of accessible route option of the mobile application HKeMobility since April 2024 by expanding the accessible route option from walking mode to public transport mode. When members of the public choose to travel by public transport, the HKeMobility can plan routes with visual aids or mobility aids to enable the public to identify barrier-free accesses (such as locations of lifts, ramps and footbridges) along the way to transport stations, so that persons with disabilities can plan their journeys more efficiently and travel on their own.

 In addition, the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has been actively pursuing web accessibility design over the years. The HKO's in-house developed mobile application ""MyObservatory"" has already incorporated guidelines on accessibility features and functions, including screen reader compatibility, alternative texts for images and selectable font size, so as to facilitate all sectors of the community (including persons with disabilities) to browse the ""MyObservatory"" to get the latest weather conditions before traveling. The HKO will continue to incorporate accessibility features and functions in the mobile application, providing enhanced weather services.

(3) The LandsD and the Spatial Data Office (SDO) of the DEVB have been promoting the application of 3D Digital Map to public and private organisations through various channels (such as public talks and workshops), to highlight the development opportunities it brings. As a key component of the 3D Digital Map, the 3D Pedestrian Network provides a wealth of useful information, such as road names, gradient and length of road sections, distribution of en-route obstacles and opening hours of public lifts, as well as wheelchair accessibility data at entrance to government facilities and public lifts. This enables barrier-free route planning for people with different commuting needs. The LandsD and the SDO of the DEVB will continue to engage with various stakeholders (including social welfare organisations and groups serving persons with disabilities), communicate with relevant public and private organisations based on stakeholder needs, promote cross-agency information exchange and collaboration, and jointly optimise the 3D Pedestrian Network to enhance the convenience of public mobility."

崔特派員（外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署特派員崔建春）、潘副特派員（外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署副特派員潘雲東）、女士們、先生們：

早上好。歡迎也感謝大家出席由中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署和律政司香港國際法律人才培訓學院首次合作舉辦的「香港青年國際法律人才帶路行」（「帶路行」）的啓動儀式。我很高興今日能跟各位充滿朝氣和活力的青年國際法律人才聚首一堂，在大家出發前跟各位作分享和打氣。

首先，我非常感謝外交部駐港公署精心籌劃今次「帶路行」活動，讓香港的青年國際法律人才有機會到訪北京和喀什，參與這次非常難得的學習交流活動。青年人是國家的未來支柱，青年的國際法律人才更肩負着推動法治建設的重要使命。要成為國家有所擔當的法律專業人士，深入了解國情是必不可少的。只有充分掌握國家的歷史文化、政治體制、經濟及科技的發展方向，才能更好掌握法律制度的設計與運作，並在實踐中有效維護國家安全和社會公平、正義。古人說讀萬卷書不如行萬里路，我認為在今時今日，既要讀萬卷書，更要行萬里路！因此，我非常支持在座的青年國際法律人才參與「帶路行」。

這次「帶路行」的行程豐富，讓大家能夠親身走訪國家兩個極具代表性的城市——首都北京和絲綢之路代表城鎮喀什，實屬難得。北京作為我們國家的政治、文化和經濟中心，是我們認識國家政策和宏觀戰略的最佳窗口。參觀科技產業公司和工廠，與人民法院、外交部和投資銀行等作交流可以讓大家全面感受這座城市的歷史底蘊與現代活力和實力，相信這對我們理解「一帶一路」倡議的政策背景和推動意義大有裨益。而喀什作為「一帶一路」西部的重要樞紐，大家可以親身體會這項倡議在邊疆地區的具體實踐，相信大家在這城市的所見所聞，包括參觀古城和與仲裁機構、綜合保稅區等的交流，將會為大家帶來許多的啓發。

我特別喜歡這次「帶路行」的口號——「律動未來BRI」，請容許我分享我自己對這個口號的一些想法。「律動」巧妙地融合了法律中的嚴謹及音樂中的節奏感，象徵着法律如同節拍般和諧地帶動着社會運行。「未來」當然是指在座各位香港青年國際法律人才，你們的國際視野和專業精神，將會成為連接香港與「一帶一路」沿線國家法律交流與合作的重要橋樑，未來為「一帶一路」倡議持續注入動力。

因此，我認為「律動未來BRI」不只是一句口號，而是大家參加這次「帶路行」的目標。希望大家通過這次「帶路行」，與不同的參訪單位作深入的交流和分享，親身感受國家在各個領域中的繁榮與穩定發展。憑着你們的專業和熱誠，積極推動「一帶一路」的法治建設，讓香港在未來的國際法律舞台上繼續發光發亮。我希望我們能夠從「律動未來BRI」，進一步實現「律動未來worldwide」。

我感謝每一位參加者的積極投入和支持。這次「帶路行」不單只是學習考察，更是一個交流與合作的平台。希望大家能抱着開放的心態，充分運用這次難能可得的機會，將這次旅程的所見所聞轉化成寶貴的經驗和知識，應用於未來的工作和發展中。

我預祝這次「帶路行」圓滿成功，大家學有所成、收獲滿滿。謝謝！"
立法會二十題：防止虐待兒童,2025-07-16 11:05,2025-07-16 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600278.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上陳曼琪議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

據報本港近年屢發生駭人聽聞的虐兒案，包括早前一名送貨員多次虐待親生女兒並引致其死亡，被告最終因謀殺罪成被判終身監禁，而其虐兒罪行則被判監六年五個月。有意見認為現時虐兒最高只可被判監十年，不能反映其嚴重性，亦未能有效制止虐兒發生，加上香港以往曾發生兒童被虐待致死的個案，當局有必要大幅提高虐兒罪行的最高刑罰，以達提高阻嚇性和保護兒童之效。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）當局於去年成功檢控的虐待兒童個案的以下資料：（i）個案宗數、（ii）檢控日期、（iii）判刑日期、（iv）是否涉及直系親屬犯案、（v）有否造成兒童死亡或嚴重人身傷害，以及（vi）被判監的個案所涉刑期；及

（二）有否計劃檢討相關法例，提高相關虐兒罪行的最高刑罰；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直以來採取多管齊下的策略保護兒童，令他們免受傷害或虐待。政府除了及早識別和介入虐待兒童個案以保護兒童，亦會支援有虐兒風險的家庭從源頭上預防虐待兒童。就議員的提問，經徵詢保安局，現綜合回覆如下。

現行多條法例保護兒童免受傷害及虐待，包括《侵害人身罪條例》（第‍212‍章）、《刑事罪行條例》（第‍200‍章）、《防止兒童色情物品條例》（第‍579‍章）及《保護兒童及少年條例》（第‍213‍章）等。

《侵害人身罪條例》（第‍212‍章）第26‍條規定，任何人非法拋棄或遺棄不足兩‍歲的兒童，以致其生命受危害，或以致其健康蒙受或相當可能蒙受永久損害，即屬犯罪；而第27‍條規定，任何超過16‍歲的人如故意襲擊、虐待、忽略、拋棄或遺棄由他所管養、看管或照顧的16‍歲或以下的兒童或少年人，而相當可能導致其受到不必要的苦楚或健康損害，即屬犯罪。在二○二四‍年審結的案件中，根據上述兩項條文而被檢控及被定罪的人數，以及被定罪人士的刑罰載於附件。保安局沒有備存上述案件中被告與受害人關係的資料，或造成死亡或嚴重人身傷害的統計數字。

《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》（《條例》）將於二○二六年一月生效。為加強及早識別和介入虐待兒童個案，《條例》強制社會福利界、教育界和醫療衞生界的指明專業人員舉報嚴重虐兒個案，為兒童編織全面而有效的保護網，同時警告潛在施虐者其虐兒行為容易會被揭發。為配合《條例》生效，政府已於今年一月展開了「保護兒童運動」，加深強制舉報者及市民大眾對《條例》的認知及提升他們對保護兒童的意識。此外，為加強從源頭預防虐兒，社會福利署（社署）會以試驗形式把四間兒童及青年中心轉型為社區親子中心，以遊戲為本的方式促進親子互動及教導家長正向育兒方法，支援有親職需要的家庭，並轉介有其他需要的家庭接受適切的政府及社區服務。社署會透過家訪及醫療服務或福利服務單位的轉介，接觸缺乏社會支援及經濟資源的家庭，並透過深入的個案及小組工作，包括治療性輔導和有系統的度身訂造小組課程，以進一步支援相關家庭。

實施強制舉報機制及成立社區親子中心標誌著保護兒童的重要里程。政府會繼續確保各項支援措施妥善到位，並會在上述措施實施後監察成效，考慮如何進一步加強保護兒童的工作，包括是否有需要提高虐兒罪行的最高刑罰。"
LCQ20: Preventing child abuse,2025-07-16 11:05,2025-07-16 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600280.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Maggie Chan and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

 It has been reported that Hong Kong has recently witnessed a series of shocking cases of child abuse, including a recent incident where a deliveryman repeatedly abused his biological daughter, leading to her death. The defendant was ultimately convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, and he was sentenced to imprisonment of six years and five months for his child abuse offence. There are views that as the current maximum penalty of child abuse is only ten years, it fails to fully reflect its severity and effectively prevent child abuse from taking place, and, given that Hong Kong has seen cases of child abuse resulting in death in the past, it is imperative for the authorities to significantly increase the maximum penalty for child abuse offence, so as to enhance deterrence and protect children. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following information regarding child abuse cases successfully prosecuted by the authorities last year: (i) number of cases, (ii) date of prosecution, (iii) date of sentence, (iv) whether the perpetrator was a direct relative of the victim, (v) whether the abuse resulted in the death of or grievous bodily harm to the child, and (vi) term of imprisonment in cases where imprisonment was imposed; and

(2) whether it has plans to review relevant legislation to increase the maximum penalty for child abuse offence; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Government has been adopting a multi-pronged strategy to protect children from harm or abuse. Apart from identifying and intervening in child abuse cases at an early stage to protect children, the Government also supports families at risk of child abuse to prevent child abuse at source. The consolidated reply to the Member's question, in consultation with Security Bureau, is as follows:

 At present, there are many pieces of legislation in place that protect children from harm and abuse, including the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212), the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200), the Prevention of Child Pornography Ordinance (Cap. 579) and the Protection of Children and Juveniles Ordinance (Cap. 213).

 Section 26 of the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212) provides that any person who unlawfully abandons or exposes a child under the age of 2 years, whereby the life of such child is endangered, or the health of such child is or is likely to be permanently injured, shall be guilty of an offence; and section 27 provides that any person over the age of 16 years who wilfully assaults, ill-treats, neglects, abandons or exposes any child or young person under the age of 16 years under the person's custody, charge or care in a manner likely to cause such child or young person unnecessary suffering or injury to his health shall be guilty of an offence. Among the cases concluded in 2024, the number of persons prosecuted and convicted under the two above-mentioned provisions, as well as the sentences for the persons convicted are at Annex. The Security Bureau does not maintain information about the relationship between the defendant and the victim, and the statistics of the death or severe bodily harm caused in the aforementioned cases.

 The Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance (the Ordinance) will come into effect in January 2026. To strengthen early identification and intervention of child abuse cases, the Ordinance mandates specified professionals in the social welfare sector, education sector and healthcare sector to report serious child abuse cases, thereby creating a wide and effective protection web for children and sending a strong deterrent to potential perpetrators that their abuse behaviours will easily be exposed. To tie in with the commencement of the Ordinance, the Government launched the Child Protection Campaign in January this year to enhance the mandated reporters and the general public's understanding of the Ordinance and raise their awareness of child protection. In addition, to strengthen prevention of child abuse from source, the Social Welfare Department (SWD) will convert four Children and Youth Centres into Community Parents and Children Centres on a pilot basis to promote parent-child interaction through play-based services and instil positive parenting skills in parents, render support for families with parenting needs, and refer families with other needs to appropriate government and community services. Through home visits and referrals from healthcare or welfare service units, the SWD will approach families of socio-economic deprivation and provide them with further support via in-depth casework and group work, including therapeutic counselling and systematic and tailor-made group programmes.

 The implementation of the mandatory reporting regime and the setting up of Community Parents and Children Centres mark an important milestone in child protection. The Government will continue to ensure that the various support measures are properly put in place, and will monitor the effectiveness of the above measures after their implementation to consider how to further enhance child protection work, including the need to increase the maximum penalties for child abuse offences."

Speech by SCST at Publishing 3.0+ Launch Ceremony (English only),2025-07-16 10:37,2025-07-16 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600244.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the Publishing 3.0+ Launch Ceremony today (July 16):

Kenneth (Member of the Legislative Council and the Chairman of Publishing 3.0+, Mr Kenneth Fok), Duncan (Member of the Legislative Council and the Chairman of Publishing 3.0+, Mr Duncan Chiu), Sharon (Executive Director of the Hong Kong Reprographic Rights Licensing Society and the Chairman of Publishing 3.0+, Dr Sharon Wong), Mr Rashid Al Kous (Executive Director of the Emirates Publishers Association), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is my great pleasure to officially launch Publishing 3.0+ with industry practitioners, scholars, experts and authors. And let me also extend my warmest welcome to Mr Rashid Al Kous, coming all the way from the United Arab Emirates, and our distinguished guests here from overseas copyright organisations around the world.

Three years ago, the then Create Hong Kong, which is now restructured as the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency, CCIDA, under my bureau, began sponsoring and steering the Publishing 3.0 project, as a touchstone of an in-depth application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the publishing industry, enabling the extensive production of e-books and audiobooks. The project enabled around 60 Hong Kong publishers to successfully convert paper publications into 5 000 bilingual e-books and audiobooks in Cantonese, Putonghua and English, seizing the tremendous opportunity of digital transformation.

Publishing 3.0+ builds on the success of its predecessor. This enhanced project will focus on large language models within the AI-driven system, and further strengthen its multilingual translation and content conversion capabilities, empower local publishers to convert Chinese books into multi-languages, and open doors to a global readership. Publishing 3.0+ will refine the e-books and audiobooks converted over the past years, and further deliver another 5 000 translated and converted copies of books.

The fruitful expected outcome of 10 000 e-books and audiobooks will be showcased in the Hong Kong pavilions at various international book fairs in the coming months. We will further leverage the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC)'s Asia IP Exchange, AsiaIPEX, to facilitate and encourage the industry to tap into the vast opportunities of copyright trading.

President Xi Jinping has emphasised that literature and art serve as bridges of mutual understanding and communication among different countries and ethnic groups. With a considerable amount of foreign classics on his reading list, President Xi repeatedly shared his deep and inseparable bond with books on international occasions when meeting foreign friends. We see that books are media that help foster friendships and exchanges between cultures.

With the great delight of having our Middle East friend here today, may I share our exciting plan that Publishing 3.0+ will soon expand to include Arabic translation. During my official visit to the Middle East in April this year, I was deeply impressed by the region's rich cultural and historical heritage. I am most delighted that Publishing 3.0+ will contribute to our effort to realising closer cultural links and friendship between the Middle East and Hong Kong, aligning the shared visions of both regions.

Publishing 3.0+ is a collaboration of multiple parties. I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to Kenneth, Duncan and Sharon, the founder of InnoContent, whose unique blend of cultural insight, technological innovation and publishing expertise has been instrumental in realising this project. My special thanks also go to SenseTime for its unparalleled AI expertise and infrastructure, which enhance the system's capabilities, and the Hong Kong Publishing Federation, the Hong Kong Reprographic Rights Licensing Society, and the Logistics and Supply Chain MultiTech R&D Centre for their unwavering support since the last project, and the HKTDC for its efforts in the intellectual property trading.

Before I close, I wish Publishing 3.0+ a striking success under the collaborative efforts by the Government, the publishing industry and technology partners. I look forward to seeing Hong Kong's AI-driven publishing sector reaches new heights, telling the good story of Hong Kong. Through this initiative, we will showcase creativity, vitality, and innovation in the age of new media.

Thank you very much."
LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-16 10:20,2025-07-16 10:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600255.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

He said, ""We are happy to see that Jianlibao has established its regional headquarters in Hong Kong. It not only highlights the city's unique advantages as a global business hub but also reinforces our position as a preferred destination for Mainland enterprises looking to expand internationally.

""The public should carry and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration while engaging in outdoor activities,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

""Those engaged in strenuous outdoor activities should avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcohol, as they speed up water loss through the urinary system,"" the spokesman explained.

""Infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and individuals who are overweight are more vulnerable to heat stroke. They should pay special attention,"" the spokesman added.

The public should adopt the following precautions:


Wear loose and light-coloured clothing to reduce heat absorption and facilitate sweat evaporation and heat dissipation;
Avoid vigorous exercise and prolonged activities like hiking or trekking as heat, sweating and exhaustion can place additional demands on the physique;
Perform outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible;
For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;
Apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen product with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply every two hours if you need to stay outdoors for a prolonged period, or after swimming, sweating or towelling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear long-sleeved and loose-fitting clothes; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

SHYA continues visit to Beijing (with photos),2025-07-15 21:13,2025-07-15 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500527.htm,"The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, continued her visit to Beijing today (July 15). Members of the delegation, including the Permanent Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Ms Shirley Lam; the Director of Home Affairs, Ms Priscilla To; and the Deputy Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs (Home Affairs), Mr Paul Wong, also accompanied her.
  
Miss Mak called on the Executive Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) of the State Council, Mr Xu Qifang, today and reported on the work of the HYAB. These include the latest developments and future work plans of district governance, youth development and women's affairs. She expressed gratitude to the HKMAO of the State Council for their support and guidance to the HYAB.

Miss Mak also called on the Vice Minister of the Society Work Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, Mr He Zhiliang, to exchange views on grassroots governance work. District governance of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has entered a new phase, and the Government fully implements executive-led governance. The District Councils, ""the three district committees"" and Care Teams form a troika after improvements to district governance. Under the leadership of the District Officers, they co-operate to serve citizens in need and create synergy. The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) and the Home Affairs Department also organise training regularly to enhance District Council (DC) members' capabilities in discharging their duties, such as arranging visits to Shanghai and Zhejiang for the DC members last year to learn about grassroots governance experiences in the country. Miss Mak said that the HYAB will continue to unite district forces and enhance service efficiency to increase the sense of happiness and contentment of the public.
  
Miss Mak then met with the Vice Minister of the State Administration for Religious Affairs, Mr Wang Zhigang, to exchange views on religious affairs. Miss Mak said that the HKSAR Government maintains close communication with religious groups in Hong Kong. She also pointed out the harmonious relationship between different religious groups and that they not only promote their teachings but also provide education, medical and welfare services, making significant contributions to building a harmonious community.
  
The inauguration ceremony of the Youth Internship Programme at Chinese Academy of Sciences was held in the afternoon. The six-week Programme is an important co-operation project co-organised by the HYAB and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It provides Hong Kong youth with high-end scientific research internship opportunities during summer vacation every year.
  
Miss Mak congratulated the 20 Hong Kong young people who stood out in the highly competitive selection process. Speaking at the ceremony, she said that the National 14th Five-Year Plan has established Hong Kong's development into an international innovation and technology centre. Seizing the opportunities, the HKSAR Government is committed to nurturing scientific research talents, and the Programme serves as an important step in grooming future technology leaders. Miss Mak expressed her hope that the Programme would inspire students' passion for scientific research and serve as the starting point for their contributions to the country and Hong Kong's innovation and technology development in the future. 
   
Miss Mak will visit Hong Kong youth participating in the Mainland legal internship programme sponsored by the HYAB Funding Scheme for Youth Internship in the Mainland and organised by the International Youth Legal Exchange Federation tomorrow morning (July 16). She will learn about their experiences interning at Mainland law firms and large enterprises. Miss Mak will conclude her trip to Beijing and depart for Sichuan at noon, while several members of the delegation will return to Hong Kong."

尊敬的韓聖健副省長（黑龍江省人民政府副省長）、劉澤禮總經理（大灣區航空有限公司中國區銷售總經理）、姜彩燕助理總幹事（香港聖公會福利協會助理總幹事）、各位嘉賓、各位「共創明『Teen』計劃」的學員：

大家好！今天我很高興再一次來到哈爾濱，出席「共創明『Teen』計劃」——香港愛國主義教育黑龍江研學團的啓動禮。首先我要感謝韓聖健副省長，因為我知道他一會就要離開黑龍江去公幹，還要特意出來出席這個典禮，我希望大家用最熱烈的掌聲感謝他。

「共創明『Teen』計劃」這個由香港特區政府牽頭，通過政、商、民三方通力合作推行的計劃，今年已經邁進第三期。計劃舉辦了很多豐富和多元化的活動，提升學員的自信心，協助他們建立正向人生觀；我們也舉辦不同類型的研學團，擴闊學員的眼界，幫助他們為自己的未來定下目標，力爭上游。

我出席了不少計劃下的團體活動，但參加這次黑龍江研學團我覺得是有特別的意義，因為今次研學團有兩個「最」。
​
第一個「最」，是「最遠」。研學團到訪的黑龍江哈爾濱，是我們同學至今走得最遠的地方。黑龍江省位於我國的東北地區，不但有壯麗的自然風光，也承載着豐富的歷史文化和民俗風情。每到冬季，這裏更有舉世聞名的冰雕藝術。

特別值得一提，黑龍江聚居着不同民族的同胞，我們可以在這裏親身感受少數民族獨特的民俗風情。而隨着國家科技的快速發展，黑龍江也湧現許多高新科技產業。希望通過這次交流活動，學員們能夠深入了解中華文化的多樣性、親身感受科技創新的魅力以及增進對祖國發展的認識。

第二個「最」，是「最多」。今次活動共有超過130名學員參與，來自不同的地區營辦機構。這是計劃開辦以來，最多學員參加的研學團。

要組織這個最多「共創明『Teen』計劃」學員參加的研學團，其實一點也不容易。在這裏，我要首先衷心感謝黑龍江政府大力支持這次研學團的組織工作，以及熱情接待。當中安排了不少具標誌性的參觀活動，例如參觀侵華日軍第七三一部隊罪証陳列館、北大荒博物館等，讓大家認清歷史，以及見證多年來建設祖國的艱苦歷程；另外也安排了參觀工廠及航天館等，讓學員認識祖國先進的科技及航天發展。

此外，我也要衷心感謝大灣區航空贊助是次活動的機票，並特別為研學團學員安排包機，令大家只需四個多小時直航時間，就能從香港直接抵達哈爾濱，爭取更多時間認識黑龍江。

我亦要特別多謝聖公會福利協會協助籌辦活動。我知道這次研學團活動的籌備時間十分緊迫，但你們都能夠安排得非常妥當，這麼豐富和多姿多彩的行程，實在非常感謝。

最後，我希望參與今次研學團的學員積極參與各項活動，進一步了解國家的歷史和發展。我祝願香港愛國主義教育黑龍江研學團圓滿成功，各位學員收獲滿滿，在座各為身心康泰、工作順利！謝謝大家！"

要組織這個最多「共創明『Teen』計劃」學員參加的研學團，其實一點也不容易。在這裏，我要首先衷心感謝黑龍江政府大力支持這次研學團的組織工作，以及熱情接待。當中安排了不少具標誌性的參觀活動，例如參觀侵華日軍第七三一部隊罪証陳列館、北大荒博物館等，讓大家認清歷史，以及見證多年來建設祖國的艱苦歷程；另外也安排了參觀工廠及航天館等，讓學員認識祖國先進的科技及航天發展。

此外，我也要衷心感謝大灣區航空贊助是次活動的機票，並特別為研學團學員安排包機，令大家只需四個多小時直航時間，就能從香港直接抵達哈爾濱，爭取更多時間認識黑龍江。

我亦要特別多謝聖公會福利協會協助籌辦活動。我知道這次研學團活動的籌備時間十分緊迫，但你們都能夠安排得非常妥當，這麼豐富和多姿多彩的行程，實在非常感謝。

最後，我希望參與今次研學團的學員積極參與各項活動，進一步了解國家的歷史和發展。我祝願香港愛國主義教育黑龍江研學團圓滿成功，各位學員收獲滿滿，在座各為身心康泰、工作順利！謝謝大家！"

TAC welcomes Government's proposal to regulate online hailing hire car services,2025-07-15 20:52,2025-07-15 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500774.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Transport Advisory Committee:

The Transport Advisory Committee (TAC) welcomes the Government's submission of the legislative proposal to regulate online hailing hire car services to the Legislative Council Panel on Transport.

The Chairman of the TAC and the Working Group for Enhancing Personalised Point-to-Point Transport Services (Working Group), Professor Stephen Cheung, said, ""The development density of Hong Kong is high, with nearly 90 per cent of commuters using public transport. We agree with the Government's adherence to a public transport oriented policy and the effective utilisation of limited road resources. With advancements in technology and changing travel patterns, booking and providing personalised point-to-point transport services through online hailing platforms have become an international trend. Various sectors of society, the taxi trade and online hailing platform companies have been calling on the Government to regulate online hailing hire car services, with a view to creating a healthy and sustainable competitive environment for the personalised point-to-point transport market.""

  ""The TAC welcomes the Government's legislative proposal to regulate online hailing hire car services from three aspects, namely platforms, vehicles, and drivers, to ensure that the services provided comply with legal requirements and regulations relating to safety standards and service quality. This will help safeguard passengers' safety and rights and meet the travel needs of the public. The TAC expects that, after the relevant regulation has been implemented, taxis will continue to maintain its current advantages and coexist with online hailing hire cars, thereby meeting passengers' diversified transport demands."" Professor Cheung continued.

The TAC established the Working Group in July last year to advise the Government on the regulation of online hailing hire car services. The Working Group comprises a number of TAC members, representatives from relevant agencies/departments, namely the Insurance Authority and the Tourism Commission, as well as representatives from the Transport and Logistics Bureau and the Transport Department. In February this year, the Working Group met with representatives from the taxi trade and online hailing platform companies to gather their views and suggestions, and subsequently received views from various taxi trade representatives, online hailing platform companies and the public regarding the regulation of online hailing hire car services. The Working Group has previously submitted the views collected, along with the research findings on the regulation of online hailing hire car services in other regions, to the Government."

交諮會主席暨「提升個人化點對點交通服務工作小組」主席張仁良教授說：「香港的發展密度高，目前接近九成的出行人次均使用公共交通服務。我們認同政府以公共交通為本，有效運用有限的道路資源的政策。而隨着科技進步和出行模式改變，近年透過網約渠道預訂及提供個人化點對點交通服務已成為國際趨勢。社會各界、的士業界和網約平台公司均期望政府盡快規管網約車服務，為個人化點對點交通服務市場締造一個良性及可持續發展的競爭環境。」

張仁良教授續說:「交諮會歡迎政府提出規管網約車服務的立法建議，並從平台、車輛及司機三方面着手，確保所提供的服務符合法例、有關安全標準和服務質素的規管要求，以保障乘客安全和權益，滿足和便利市民出行需要。交諮會期望在有關規管落實後，的士會繼續保持現時的優勢，亦與網約車兩者並存互補，滿足乘客多元化的出行需求。」

交諮會於去年七月成立工作小組，就如何規管網約車服務向政府提供意見，成員包括部分交諮會委員、相關機構／部門（保險業監管局和旅遊事務署）代表，以及運輸及物流局和運輸署代表。工作小組今年二月分別與的士業界及網約車平台公司代表會面，聽取他們的意見和建議，其後亦收到不同的士業界代表、網約車平台公司及公眾人士就規管網約車服務的意見。工作小組早前已向政府提交所收到的意見，以及就其他地區規管網約車服務的經驗的調研結果。"

The CFS is following up on the incident.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned sample from a retail shop with a frozen confection factory licence in Kowloon City for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that the sample contained 120 coliform bacteria per gram and 220 000 bacteria per gram, both exceeding the legal limits.

  ""The CFS conducted an investigation of the premises immediately, took food samples for laboratory testing, and informed the food premises concerned of the irregularity. The investigation revealed that the frozen yoghurt was produced in the premises concerned. The premises has already stopped selling the frozen yoghurt, and discarded the affected product according to the CFS's advice. The CFS has also provided health education on food safety and hygiene to the person-in-charge and staff of the premsises, and requested the staff to carry out a thorough cleaning and disinfection,"" the spokesman said.

Under the Frozen Confections Regulation (Cap. 132AC), frozen confection for sale should not contain more than 100 coliform bacteria per gram or more than 50 000 bacteria per gram. The maximum penalty for offenders is a fine of $10,000 and three months' imprisonment upon conviction. The fact that the coliform count and the total bacterial count exceeded the legal limit indicated that the hygienic conditions were unsatisfactory, but did not mean that consumption would lead to food poisoning.

The CFS will continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action to safeguard food safety and public health. An investigation is ongoing."

Members of the public should stop using the ointment if they have been prescribed the cream products concerned.

  Acting upon intelligence, the DH raided CMP Chan Ching-ting's premises in Capitol Centre Tower 2 and seized a batch of cream product for analysis. Test results from the Government Laboratory confirmed that samples of two unlabelled yellow cream products (see photo) contained undeclared Western drug ingredients, namely triamcinolone acetonide, miconazole and paracetamol. In addition to the above ingredients, the large bottle of about 5.5 centimetres in diameter was also found to contain another undeclared Western drug ingredient, dexamethasone. In the light of the test results, the DH notified the police today and arrested the registered female Chinese medicine practitioner, who is suspected of illegal possession of Part 1 poisons and unregistered pharmaceutical products.

  Dexamethasone and triamcinolone acetonide are corticosteroids. They are Part 1 poisons and prescription medicines for treating inflammation. Inappropriate use of corticosteroids may cause serious side effects such as Cushing's syndrome, with symptoms including moon face and muscle atrophy. Miconazole, a Part 1 poison, is an antifungal medicine commonly used for the treatment of fungal infections of the skin. It can cause side effects such as itching, irritation and an allergic reaction when used topically. Paracetamol is commonly used for its anti-pyretic and analgesic effects but an overdose may cause liver and kidney damage.

  The DH will continue to investigate the case and has requested the CMP concerned to contact her patients who have been prescribed the cream products concerned for medical surveillance.

  According to the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138), illegal possession of Part 1 poisons and unregistered pharmaceutical products are criminal offences. The maximum penalty for each offenceupon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment. Upon completion of the investigations, the DH will consult the Department of Justice on prosecution matters. The DH would refer the case to the Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong for consideration of possible disciplinary action.

  Members of the public who have been prescribed with cream products by the above CMP who feel unwell or are in doubt should consult healthcare professionals as soon as possible. They may submit the medicines concerned to the DH's Chinese Medicine Regulatory Office at 16/F, AIA Kowloon Tower, Landmark East, 100 How Ming Street, Kwun Tong, Kowloon, during office hours for disposal."

They were subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence, which reflects that whether a passenger is a first-time offender or not, they may be imprisoned. The custodial sentence imposes a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

反非法勞工行動拘十五人（附圖）,2025-07-15 18:00,2025-07-15 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500626.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於六月下旬至今日（七月十五日）在全港多區展開代號為「光影行動」的反非法勞工行動，以打擊非法外賣員。行動中入境處特遣隊人員共拘捕八名懷疑非法勞工及七名涉嫌協助及教唆者。

被捕的懷疑非法勞工為八名非華裔男子，年齡介乎二十五至五十五歲，當中七名男子為免遣返聲請人士，並持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）。

此外，七名涉嫌協助及教唆者均為香港居民，共六男一女，年齡介乎三十三至五十二歲。他們亦因涉嫌出售或租借外賣員帳號予非法勞工，串謀詐騙外賣平台而被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"
15 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photo),2025-07-15 18:00,2025-07-15 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500629.htm,"The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Lightshadow"" to combat illegal food delivery couriers from late June to today (July 15). During the anti-illegal worker operations, a total of eight suspected illegal workers and seven suspected aiders and abettors were arrested by ImmD Task Force officers.

 The eight arrested suspected illegal workers are non-ethnic Chinese males aged 25 to 55. Among them, seven men were found to be holders of recognisance forms and were non-refoulement claimants, which prohibit them from taking any employment in Hong Kong.

 Furthermore, the seven suspected aiders and abettors are Hong Kong residents aged 33 to 52. The six men and one woman were arrested for being suspected of a conspiracy to defraud delivery platforms by selling or renting their food delivery courier accounts to the illegal workers.

 An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

 The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining in any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrantif the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable with imprisonment for not less than two years.""

 The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

 According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman reminded all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

 Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."
"LegCo Secretariat releases Policy Pulse on ""Strategies and edges of Hong Kong in hydrogen development""",2025-07-15 17:26,2025-07-15 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500548.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Legislative Council Secretariat:

  The Legislative Council (LegCo) Secretariat today (July 15) released the latest issue of the Policy Pulse on ""Strategies and edges of Hong Kong in hydrogen development"". This issue provides a brief overview of hydrogenenergy development strategies in Hong Kong, the edges of promoting the hydrogenenergy industry, the latest progress of improving relevant legislation by the Government, as well as relevant discussions of LegCo along with suggestions by Members.

  LegCo will resume the Second Reading debate on the Gas Safety (Amendment) Bill 2025 tomorrow (July 16). The Bill seeks to regulate the use of hydrogen as fuel to ensure the safe application of hydrogen fuel. It also empowers the Government to introduce new subsidiary legislation to ensure the flexibility of updating the regulatory requirements. The Government intends to introduce subsidiary legislation in 2026 to cover the entire supply chain of hydrogen as fuel.

  The Policy Pulse highlights that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government actively promotes the development of hydrogen energy, and promulgated the Strategy of Hydrogen Development in Hong Kong last year. Setting out four major strategies of improving legislation, establishing standards, aligning with the market and advancing with prudence, the Strategy aims to create an environment conducive to the development of hydrogen energy in Hong Kong in an orderly manner, so as to make preparations for the wider application of hydrogen energy in the future.

  With a ""zero carbon emissions"" feature, hydrogen is a new energy with significant decarbonisation potential. Our country is the largest hydrogen producer in the world, and strives to achieve the ""dual carbon"" goals of peaking carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060. The SAR Government also targets to cut carbon emissions by half from the 2005 level before 2035 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. The Policy Pulse points out that, with its unique advantage of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world, as well as the strengths in scientific research, robust legislation and energy infrastructure, Hong Kong has very great potential to become a demonstration base for the development of hydrogen energy in the country, and facilitate the development of the hydrogenenergy industry in the Belt and Road region and other overseas places. In addition, as an international financial centre, Hong Kong can help enterprises with their green transformation by providing green financing and professional services.

  The Policy Pulse also introduces a number of measures by the SAR Government to support research and innovation in the hydrogen energy technology. These include setting up the Inter-departmental Working Group on Using Hydrogen as Fuel to co-ordinate the efforts in promoting the local use of hydrogen energy and initiate relevant trial projects. Meanwhile, the Government has launched several funding schemes that cover the research and development of hydrogen energy technology, and actively promotes talent training, technological exchange and application in relevant scientific and technological fields, so as to cultivate professionals with the specialised knowledge and skills to ensure the safe application of hydrogen energy technology.

  LegCo Members have long attached great importance to the development of hydrogen energy in Hong Kong. In March 2023, LegCo passed a motion advocating the SAR Government to comprehensively promote the development of hydrogenenergy industry in Hong Kong. The LegCo Panel on Environmental Affairs also visited hydrogen projects during its duty visit to Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (the Greater Bay Area) in August of the same year, and has been following up on issues related to hydrogen energy. The Policy Pulse summarises various recommendations made by Members on hydrogen energy development. These include capitalising on the strengths of Hong Kong's financial services industry to attract capital investment in the city's hydrogenenergy industry and reserve land for development. Furthermore, the Government should take the lead in developing green industries and make use of new development areas as a springboard to bring in quality hydrogenenergy industries; formulate relevant policies on hydrogen energy pricing to stimulate demand for hydrogen energy; promote carbon index certification to include hydrogen energy into Hong Kong's carbon emissions trading market; and actively research and develop local hydrogen production technology, among others.

  The Policy Pulse points out that hydrogen energy is an integral component of the country's future energy system. Members urge the Government to collaborate with other cities in the Greater Bay Area on the joint research, development and promotion of hydrogen energy development projects to facilitate exchanges and co-operation between the two places across the hydrogen energy industrial chain, with a view to promoting the alignment of the safety monitoring and quality testing standards between Hong Kong and the Mainland. Members also advise the Government to speed up the development of a set of internationally recognised hydrogen energy certification standards, so as to assist the Greater Bay Area and even the entire hydrogen industry in the country to enter the international market.

  The detailed content of ""Strategies and edges of Hong Kong in hydrogen development"" is available on the LegCo Website. The Policy Pulse, published by the Council Business Divisions of the LegCo Secretariat, covers specific topics and offers a comprehensive overview of related policy developments and summarised discussions in LegCo."

  A spokesman for the Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, one of the participating organisations, commented that the career fair facilitated effective interactions between global professionals in artificial intelligence, fintech and smart city technologies as well as digital innovation with Hong Kong employers. Nearly 90 per cent of participating enterprises and organisations expressed satisfaction with the event arrangements and indicated interest in joining future recruitment events organised by HKTE.

  In addition, HKTE co-organised physical job fairs with working partners two weeks ago, including the second edition of the Hong Kong International Talents Career Expo 2025 and the NovaX Global Investmatch Carnival 2025, to connect I&T talent and entrepreneurs with employers and investors, facilitating the settlement of talent in Hong Kong.

Comparing May 2025 with May 2024, the prices of total exports of goods and imports of goods increased by 1.8% and 1.9% respectively.

As regards price changes in the first five months of 2025 over the same period in 2024, the prices of total exports of goods and imports of goods increased by 1.9% and 2.0% respectively.

Price changes in external merchandise trade are reflected by changes in unit value indices of external merchandise trade, which are compiled based on average unit values or, for certain commodities, specific price data.

The terms of trade index is derived from the ratio of price index of total exports of goods to that of imports of goods. Compared with the same periods in 2024, the index decreased by 0.1% in May 2025, whereas it remained virtually unchanged in the first five months of 2025.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on July 14 to noon today (July 15), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 129 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit.

文化體育及旅遊局局長在廣州會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-07-15 14:52,2025-07-15 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500447.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（七月十五日）在廣州出席「HELLO PANDAS 安安可可迎全運‧遇見珠水‧荔路繁花」嘉年華啓動禮後會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：局長，全運會（第十五屆全國運動會）的籌備進度如何？是否滿意其進度？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：全運會籌備做得很好，如火如荼，因為快將（進入）倒數100日的日子，所有測試賽已經完成，測試賽後的反應在微調中，我們正努力商討票務安排，而三間特許商品店都在七月十四日開始營業。我前往觀察過，市民和旅客反應都很熱烈。今日我們來廣州也有安安、可可迎全運，將熊貓經濟和全運會結合在一起，進度是很良好的。我們當然要加緊努力，因為全運會正式的賽期越來越近了。

記者：票務安排方面，早前香港指正跟廣東省協調票價，局長有否給予意見？票價如何才算合理？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：我們當然希望越多市民、無論是粵港澳三地旅客、全國旅客或外來旅客，都能很開心地參與全運會，所以票價方面一定不會是天價，當然也要合理。這方面，其實三地組委會都在商議，我也很希望盡快在暑假有消息向大家公布。

記者：文體旅局推動旅遊業界推出一些全運會旅遊產品方面，現在進度如何？初步有沒有一些產品可以吸引更多不同觀眾，例如香港、澳門和內地旅客以「一程多站」方式出遊？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：全運會本身已經很吸引，有些項目我早前也不止一次說過，甚至可能比奧運會更精彩，所以這本身已經是一個很大的吸引（點）。當然在全運會這麼大的盛事裏，在文化藝術方面或旅遊景點，我相信三地都會很努力，希望將自己最好的一面呈現出來。在香港來說，旅遊業界已經摩拳擦掌，待票務安排有具體公布，我們便會向旅遊業界介紹，讓他們處理一些旅遊產品，旅發局（香港旅遊發展局）當然也會大力宣傳。

記者：跨境文旅項目對港澳旅客吸引方面成效如何？在三地合作方面有何挑戰？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：粵港澳其實真是一家人來的，我們同文同語，優勢互補很強。今日我們來到珠江，有羊城美食，剛才開幕禮時大家也看到一些文體表演、文藝活動。香港也一樣，我們在發布全運會商品時，香港舞蹈團也跳了一場以劍擊為主題的現代舞。我相信很多此類文藝活動會在全運會期間，無論在節目表演中，或是白天看完節目後，晚上又可以去一些文藝活動，我們會大力安排和配合，也看看旅遊業界可否將它們包裝成好的產品以吸引旅客。

記者：三地合作上有甚麼挑戰？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：三地的合作一向也很好，因為粵港澳交流、融合，也有一小時生活圈，大家的接觸很頻密，所以對大家的處事方式也有一定理解。當然，全運會是一個很大的活動，而廣東省是很有經驗的，已經是第三屆舉辦（全運會）了。香港和澳門方面，這是我們第一次共同承辦全運會，很多事情我們可以交流觀摩，也有很多學習的地方。多謝。"
Hong Kong cinema's cultural legacy celebrated in New York (with photos),2025-07-15 13:16,2025-07-15 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071400531.htm,"Hong Kong cinema is taking centre stage at this year's New York Asian Film Festival (NYAFF) with the ""Hong Kong Panorama"" series, a curated showcase of 10 dynamic films being presented with support from the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in New York (New York ETO).

  A star-studded award presentation was held prior to the North American premiere of ""Last Song For You"" this evening (July 14, New York time) at the esteemed Film at Lincoln Center. The film's lead actor, Ekin Cheng, was honoured with the prestigious Star Asia Award, recognising his legendary contributions across film, television, and music, as well as his enduring impact on Hong Kong's popular culture.

  Cheng's co-star Natalie Hsu received the Screen International Rising Star Award, highlighting her breakout performances and her bright future on the global stage.

  The New York ETO hosted a special reception before the award presentation in honour of the visiting Hong Kong film talent participating in this year's Festival. Among them are actors, directors, and creatives whose work is helping to shape the next chapter of Hong Kong cinema.

  Speaking at the reception, the Director of the New York ETO, Ms Maisie Ho, highlighted the lineup for this year's Festival. ""This year we're proud to showcase 10 diverse Hong Kong films, from romantic comedies and crime thrillers to powerful action dramas. Over half of them are having their North American premieres right here at NYAFF - proof that Hong Kong cinema continues to innovate, inspire, and resonate across borders,"" she said.

  Ms Ho added that four of these films are marking directorial debuts. They are: Jill Leung's ""Last Song For You""; Jack Lai's ""Possession Street""; Trevor Choi's ""Smashing Frank""; and ""Valley of the Shadow of Death"" by Jeffrey Lam and Antonio Tam.

   ""Three films, 'Last Song For You', 'Papa' and 'Possession Street', were made possible with support from the Hong Kong Film Development Fund. It's this mix of rising talent and strong institutional backing that keeps our film industry vibrant, evolving, and ready for the world stage,"" she added.

  Ms Ho went on to extend warm congratulations to the honourees. She praised Cheng for his 37-year career and for helping shape the cultural DNA of Hong Kong entertainment, and lauded Hsu as a gifted and dynamic artist representing the bold future of Hong Kong cinema.

  To further honour Cheng's legacy, the NYAFF held a special retrospective screening of his iconic film ""Young and Dangerous"", celebrating the blockbuster's 30th anniversary and its enduring impact on a generation of filmmakers and audiences.

  In addition to Cheng and Hsu, a stellar delegation of Hong Kong filmmakers are attending this year's NYAFF.

立法會秘書處發布「香港氫能發展策略及優勢」的《專題快訊》,2025-07-15 13:10,2025-07-15 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500379.htm,"下稿代立法會秘書處發出：

立法會秘書處（秘書處）今日（七月十五日）發布最新一期《專題快訊》――「香港氫能發展策略及優勢」，扼要介紹香港氫能發展的策略、推動氫能產業的優勢，以及政府完善相關法規的最新進展，並綜述立法會的相關討論和議員建議。

立法會將於明日（七月十六日）恢復《二○二五年氣體安全（修訂）條例草案》的二讀辯論，規管用作燃料的氫氣，以確保氫燃料的安全使用，並賦權當局日後可引入新的附屬法例，確保更新規管要求的靈活性。政府擬在二○二六年引入附屬法例，涵蓋作為燃料的氫氣的整個供應鏈。

《專題快訊》介紹特區政府積極推動氫能發展，及於去年公布的《香港氫能發展策略》，透過完善法規、制訂標準、配合市場和審慎推進的四大策略，有序地營造有利本地氫能發展的環境，有助將來更廣泛應用氫能。

氫能是一種「零碳排放」的新能源，具減碳潛力。國家作為世界上最大製氫國，力爭在二○三○前碳排放量達峰，並在二○六○年前實現碳中和，以實現「雙碳」目標。特區政府亦希望在二○三五年前把香港碳排放量從二○○五年的水平減半，並在二○五○年前實現碳中和。《專題快訊》指出，香港擁有「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的得天獨厚優勢，並具有科研實力、完善法規和能源基建等條件，同時作為國際金融中心，可提供綠色融資和專業服務，幫助企業綠色轉型。香港極具潛力成為國家發展氫能的示範基地，助力氫能產業在「一帶一路」和其他海外地方的發展。

《專題快訊》簡介特區政府推出多項措施，支援氫能技術科研創新，包括氫能源跨部門工作小組統籌推動氫燃料的本地應用，並推展多個試驗項目。此外，政府當局亦推出多個涵蓋氫能技術研發的資助計劃，並積極推動相關科技領域的人才培訓、技術交流和應用，以培養具備專業知識和技能的人才，確保氫能技術的安全應用。

立法會議員一直關注香港氫能發展，立法會在二○二三年三月通過一項議案，倡議特區政府全面推動香港氫能產業發展。環境事務委員會在同年八月前往粵港澳大灣區內地城市進行職務訪問，參觀氫能項目，並一直跟進氫能相關議題。《專題快訊》綜述議員曾就氫能發展提出的多項意見，包括建議政府當局善用香港金融服務業的優勢，吸引資金投放於香港的氫能產業，並預留土地發展；主導發展綠色產業，利用新發展區作為跳板，引入優質氫能產業；制訂氫能價格相關政策，拉動氫能需求；推動碳指標認證，將氫能納入香港碳排放交易市場；以及積極進行本地製氫的技術研發等。

《專題快訊》指出，氫能是國家未來能源體系的重要組成部分。議員促請當局與其他粵港澳大灣區城市共同研究、開發和推動氫能產業發展項目，推動兩地在氫能產業鏈的交流合作，促進香港與內地在安全監督與品質檢測標準的對接工作。議員亦建議當局加快建立一套國際認可的氫能認證標準，以協助大灣區，以至全國的氫能產業走進國際市場。

「香港氫能發展策略及優勢」的詳細內容可於立法會網頁瀏覽。《專題快訊》由秘書處議會事務部編製，旨在聚焦介紹特定議題、剖析政策發展，並綜述立法會相關討論。"
​行政長官於行政會議前會見傳媒開場發言及答問內容（附短片）,2025-07-15 13:00,2025-07-15 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500376.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（七月十五日）上午出席行政會議前會見傳媒的開場發言及答問內容：

行政長官：各位早晨。在二○一四年，11年前，第一個網約車平台開始進入香港市場。由於一直沒有制定監管制度，而的士服務質素又未符合到市民期望，多年來產生了各種問題，包括網約車的合法性、車輛和乘客的安全保障、保險、司機的水平；網約車和的士如何共存；的士司機和營運者如何利用網約提升服務和增加營運空間；如何提供整體有效的點對點交通服務等。由於問題複雜，涉及廣泛因素、多個角色和多方面利益，11年來都未有制定監管方案。我同意問題複雜，但認為問題不應該再拖，政府必須拿出解決方法。今日下午，運輸及物流局會向立法會交通事務委員會提交文件，提出規管網絡預約出租汽車服務的立法建議。

我要求運輸及物流局按以下原則，制定立法方案：

（一）須制定規管網約車服務平台運作，定下標準和責任，並說明營運要求，以確保有效管理網約車服務和安全運作。
（二）須制定有關車輛的規管要求，以確保網約車服務的質素和安全。
（三）須制定司機駕駛資格和要求，以確保網約車司機的駕駛服務安全。
（四）須制定適當的保險要求，以保障乘客安全和利益。
（五）須為的士服務制定網約營運環境，以提升的士營運效能和營業空間，既為市民提供更好的的士服務，亦提供新的的士營業空間。
（六）須營造網約車和的士共存環境，為市民提供優質網約點對點出行服務。
（七）由於網約車和的士共存的立法方案涉及問題複雜，社會有很多不同的意見；但社會同時已有清晰的共識——就網約車服務須以立法形式規管，保障乘客安全。因此，運輸及物流局可以先處理較有共識的問題，定下立法框架，之後再聚焦處理有較多不同意見的其他技術細節問題。

我期望立法會交通事務委員會充分討論政府的建議。政府會聽取意見，並細心研究，盡快提交立法草案。

另外，明日（七月十六日）是DSE文憑試（香港中學文憑考試）放榜的日子，在這個充滿期待的時刻，我想趁這個機會，與考生說幾句心底說話。首先，完成DSE考試，代表完成中學學習階段，這本身已經是一件有特別意義的事。只要你曾經盡力，你熬過的夜晚、流過的汗水，都代表你完成了成長過程中的重要里程碑階段。在中學六年，你收穫的不單是知識與成績，還有老師的教誨、同學的友誼，這些都是伴隨你人生的珍貴財富。

政府為DSE考生提供了優質多元的升學出路，當中，由教資會（大學教育資助委員會）資助大學和各種自資院校，包括應用科學大學等，共提供超過22 000個政府資助以及自資的全日制學士學位課程學額，約為今年DSE日校考生總數的一半；此外，全日制副學位課程、應用教育文憑，以及職業訓練局（職訓局）的基礎課程文憑及職專文憑，總共提供37 000個學額；應屆考生還可以選擇職訓局酒店及旅遊學院、中華廚藝學院、國際廚藝學院、香港建造學院、勞工處「展翅青年就業計劃」等其他課程。

想在內地或海外升學，DSE資歷亦獲得全球超過1 000間的院校認可。DSE考生可以按志向和個人所長，選擇最適合自己的升學途徑。

文憑試是人生旅途的其中一站，而非終點。人生從來不是短跑，有着不同的階段，旅途中，有時順風，有時逆浪，但方向比過程更重要。無論你的成績如何，無論你選擇哪一條路升學、就業、創業，或是探索更多可能性，每一條路都有它的特色和機遇，每一次嘗試都是成功和成長的機會。

特區政府會不斷為你們提供多元的出路與支持。無論你想聽取他人的意見，尋求協助或者找人傾訴，政府部門、家人和朋友，都伴着你們一起處理問題。記住，天生我才必有用，行行出狀元。謝謝大家。

記者：特首你好。第一，想問網約車框架方面，在網約車發牌量方面，政府認為是幾千個或是以萬計才合理？政府會根據甚麼數據來釐定發牌量？方案落實之後，市民等候車輛會否更久？怎樣令今次方案真正能夠站在人民一邊？另外，想問上周超前部署的停課安排。有人質疑周三就決定周五停課是太早，特首你是否同意？今次事件是否代表政府沒有辦法太早預測之後有暴雨，會否檢討這機制？將來還會否有類似超前部署的安排？多謝特首。

行政長官：首先，有關網約車方面的立法建議，在今日發給立法會交通事務委員會的文件中，會就我剛才定下的每個原則作出立法建議。

在我的原則中有提及過，要制定一個立法框架讓網約車可以與的士共存。而在這框架下，我們除了向市民提供優質、方便的點對點交通服務以外，亦應該營造有利的士營業的新空間。

在一些特別是技術性問題，正如剛才你所提及的社會意見，是很不相同的，所以我剛才給運輸及物流局的原則，就是一個11年來都未有解決的問題所涉及的元素，一定是複雜的。我們應該盡快就已經有共識的不同要點，首先做出一個立法框架，然後就一些較為有不同意見的技術問題，包括剛才你所說有關應該容許網約車的數量是多少，在完成立法框架後，可以聚焦處理這方面的問題。這是我給運輸及物流局的指示。我亦希望社會明白，這個11年來都沒有處理好的問題，涉及的各種問題的確是複雜的，各種利益是複雜的，涉及的各色人物、所要處理的問題亦是多的。所以，我會建議首先將有共識的事情處理好，我們走了第一個大步，接着剩下技術的小步，我們聚焦處理，亦會多聽意見、多作研究。我希望在交通事務委員會充分討論之後，亦會收集不同意見，之後作深入研究處理各種問題，尤其是一些技術細節的問題。

另外，關於最近因為熱帶氣旋丹娜絲，政府的應對極端天氣督導委員會作出一系列工作，我明白在超前部署方面，政府部門是希望將風險減到最低，而最終作出了有關停課的決定。

針對由政務司司長領導的委員會為應對熱帶氣旋丹娜絲而統籌各個部門作超前部署，在這方面的行動絕對是對的。這些部署包括渠務署特別檢查和清理容易因為淤塞而水浸的地點，路政署亦迅速地覆檢行車和行人隧道的水浸警告系統，以及其他工務部門指示員工和承建商隨時候命。

應急部門包括消防處、警務處、民眾安全服務隊和醫療輔助隊都做好應急準備，以及民政事務總署亦動員區議會、地區「三會」委員和關愛隊等，向居民發放最新的天氣資訊，這些都是對的。

部門所作的大量預防和應對準備工作，我們今次是這樣做，我相信將來亦應該這樣做，來確保我們可以做更多預防和應對的措施。

有關委員會停課的決定，我們聽到社會不同的意見，我們會總結經驗，在以後部署應對極端天氣時作通盤考慮。多謝大家。

記者：特首，你好。想跟進政府建議透過立法方式設立同性伴侶登記機制，有議員批評政府沒有全面評估該制度的影響，特首你有何看法？是否應該尊重終院裁決？現時這麼多政黨都表明反對，其實有沒有信心可以通過條例草案？另外，剛才提到港大法律系學生懷疑用AI製作同學的色情相片，校方只是發警告信，你覺得此做法是否適合？是否輕視事件，對受害人不公平？應對不當使用AI個案，有沒有需要修例處理？還有，港大仍然出現以假學歷申請入讀的個案，但校方只是不批准入學，沒有報警處理。你作為港大校監，認為情況是否不理想？造假的學生有沒有需要負上刑事責任？謝謝。

行政長官：在岑子杰對律政司司長一案中，終審法院裁定特區政府有積極義務確立替代框架，讓同性伴侶關係獲得法律承認。這已經是終審的裁決，特區政府不能夠違反終審法院的裁定，必須作出適當的履行方案。現時政制及內地事務局所設定的替代框架是符合法庭裁決的方案，是政制及內地事務局經過詳細研究和充分考慮法律意見而制訂的。

我要強調以下幾點。香港的合法婚姻是一男一女、一夫一妻制的異性婚姻；終審法院的判決亦肯定了《基本法》下所保障的婚姻只限於異性婚姻；終審法院裁定政府有積極義務確立替代框架，讓同性關係獲得法律承認。這是終審法院的裁決，有法律效力，對政府有約束力，政府不能違反法庭裁決，否則是違反法治。法治是香港經濟、投資者信心和賴以成功的基石，違反法治，後果嚴重；根據《基本法》，特區政府有責任擬定並提出法案，立法會有責任審議法案、修訂法案、投票通過或不通過法案；根據《基本法》，司法機構依法行使獨立審判權，而立法會亦依法行使立法權，兩者各司其職，特區政府尊重司法機關和立法機關依照《基本法》行使各自權力；特區政府會全力配合立法會審議由政制及內地事務局提交的條例草案，協助立法會盡快完成審議，並且尊重立法會的最終審議結果。

有關有大學生以AI（人工智能）生成一些裸露照片，我想指出，大學除了培育學生的知識外，亦應該以立德樹人的精神，培育大學生的德行。任何傷害他人的行為，除了可能涉及刑事罪行外，亦可能侵犯他人的私隱和個人利益。大學有責任嚴肅處理學生的行為問題，除了以校規處理缺德行為外，如果涉及違法，應該向執法部門舉報，以儆效尤。大部分的現行法例，原則上適用於網絡世界，當中包括《刑事罪行條例》下，未經同意下而發布或威脅發布私密影像的罪行，或《刑事罪行條例》所涵蓋的不誠實取用電腦罪行，以及《個人資料（私隱）條例》，就針對個人資料私隱行為作出的刑事規管。

政府的數字辦（數字政策辦公室）在今年四月發布了《香港生成式人工智能技術及應用指引》，為技術開發者、服務提供者和使用者提供應用生成式人工智能技術的實務操作指引，推動持份者在嚴格遵循科技倫理、道德準則和法律規範的基礎上，安全且負責任地開展涉及生成式人工智能的相關業務和活動，同時提供切實可行的指引，協助應對生成式人工智能技術引發的安全問題和風險。人工智能是新興科技，發展迅速萬變，很短時間內就可能出現新的變化和能力。政府會密切監察人工智能的發展和應用情況，亦審視全球管理趨勢，參考國際最佳實踐，深入研究如何處理。

至於任何涉及違法的行為，包括向大學提供任何文件以尋求批准入學資格等，如果涉及違法行為，大學亦應該報警處理。大學是一個既灌輸知識，亦應該培育德才兼備的大學生的地方，所以在這方面，如有任何發現違反法律或我剛才所說的原則，應該嚴厲依法處理。我希望所有涉及這方面問題的各個單位，都以這個態度確保香港的教育質素、大學水平符合我們的預期。我們在這方面一向做得好，必須確保我們在這方面的國際高水平。多謝大家。

Remarks by CE at media session before ExCo (with video),2025-07-15 13:00,2025-07-15 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500369.htm,"  Following are the remarks by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at a media session before the Executive Council meeting today (July 15):

Reporter: Good morning. In light of a recent saga over an HKU student being accused of using AI to generate pornographic photos of women he knew, what's the criteria and timeline for the Government to decide if a legal amendment is needed to plug the loophole of AI-produced intimate images? In face of strong opposition from lawmakers, what will the Government do to get the proposal to recognise same-sex partnerships in Hong Kong passed, and if the bill is vetoed, will you consider the Government to have fulfilled the court's order to set up the policy, or would the Government table another proposal? Thank you.

Chief Executive: Universities, in addition to imparting academic knowledge, bear the responsibility of developing students' moral character, in accordance with the guiding principle of fostering and nurturing talent. Any conduct that causes harm to others may constitute a criminal offence and may also infringe individual rights and also privacy. Therefore, universities should deal with student misconduct seriously. While some misconduct may be dealt with under internal university rules, any act that may contravene the law should be reported to law enforcement agencies for action. Most of Hong Kong's existing laws are applicable to activities on the Internet. These include offences under the Crimes Ordinance concerning publication or threats to publish intimate images without consent, the offence of access to computer with dishonest intent under the Crimes Ordinance, and the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, which criminalises privacy violations.

  In April 2025, the Digital Policy Office of the Government released the Hong Kong Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Technical and Application Guideline. It offers practical operational directives for developers, service providers and users of generative AI systems. The guideline promotes the safe and responsible development of generative AI-related business and activities by stakeholders through strict adherence to technological ethics, moral principles and legal requirements, while providing practical guidelines and guidance to address security challenges and risks associated with generative AI technologies. AI is an emergent technology that evolves very rapidly with new capabilities and developments changing in a very short period of time. The Government will closely monitor the situation regarding the fast development and application of AI, examine global regulatory trends, and conduct in-depth research into international best practices to see what we should do.

  In regard to the case you mentioned, in the case of Sham Tsz Kit v Secretary for Justice, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) ruled that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has a positive obligation to establish an alternative framework for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships. The decision made by the CFA is final. The HKSAR Government cannot contravene the determination of the CFA and must take appropriate follow-up action. The alternative framework, now proposed by the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau (CMAB), complies with the court's judgment. It was formulated by the CMAB after thorough research and full consideration of legal advice. I want to emphasise the following points.

  First, a lawful marriage in Hong Kong is between one man and one woman, and a monogamous and heterosexual marriage. Second, the CFA's judgment also affirms that the right to marriage protected under the Basic Law is limited to heterosexual marriage. Third, the CFA ruled that the Government has a positive obligation to establish an alternative framework for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships. The CFA's ruling has the force of law and is legally binding on the Government. The Government must not act in violation of the court's ruling; otherwise, it will be against the rule of law. The rule of law is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's economy, investors' confidence, and its long-established success. Violating the rule of law will mean serious consequences. Fourth, under the Basic Law, the HKSAR Government is responsible for proposing and introducing bills. The Legislative Council (LegCo) is responsible for scrutinising, amending and voting to pass or reject bills. Fifth, under the Basic Law, the Judiciary exercises independent adjudication power, whereas the LegCo exercises legislative power. Both of them perform their respective constitutional roles. The HKSAR Government respects the Judiciary and the LegCo in exercising their respective powers under the Basic Law. Sixth, the HKSAR Government will make every effort to facilitate the LegCo's scrutiny of the bill introduced by the CMAB, assist the LegCo in completing the scrutiny expeditiously, and respect the LegCo's final decision. Thank you.

(Please also refer to the Chinese portion of the remarks.)"
