基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-09-24 17:30,2025-09-24 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092400923.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（九月二十四日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得22宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（九月十四日至九月二十日）廣東省新增2 771宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較過去兩周分別201宗（九月七日至十三日）及178宗（八月三十一日至九月六日）顯著增加，當中2 583宗個案在江門市錄得。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

自二○二五年初至八月，全球16個國家／地區呈報了約31萬7千宗基孔肯雅熱病例及135宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-24 17:30,2025-09-24 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092400939.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 24), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 22 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 2 771 new CF cases in Guangdong in the past week (September 14 to 20), a significant increase compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 201 cases (September 7 to 13) and 178 cases (August 31 to September 6) respectively, in which 2 583 cases were recorded in Jiangmen. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of August, approximately 317 000 CF cases and 135 CF-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

 
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the CHP and the Travel Health Service, the latest Travel Health News, tips for using insect repellents, and the CHP Facebook Page, Instagram Account and YouTube Channel, and also the Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated page of the FEHD."

SFST showcases Hong Kong's strengths to European ministers of finance at high-level conference organised by Ministry of Finance of Slovenia (with photos),2025-09-24 11:40,2025-09-24 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092400284.htm,"  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, attended a high-level roundtable conference with European ministers of finance and financial experts from different regions in Ljubljana, Slovenia,on September 23 (Ljubljana time) and showcased Hong Kong's unparalleled strengths in converging its global advantage and its China advantage in one single city. He also promoted Hong Kong's vibrant financial markets to the Slovenian business community.

   The high-level conference themed ""Unlocking Growth: The Future of Slovenian and European Capital Markets"" was hosted by the Ministry of Finance of Slovenia, and gathered ministers of finance from Croatia, Estonia and Slovenia, theCommissioner for Financial Services and the Savings and Investments Union of the European Commission, as well as many more financial leaders and experts to share insights in driving a more promising future for European capital markets.

  As one of the panellists at the panel discussion titled ""Global Practices in Capital Markets"", Mr Hui said that Hong Kong is strategically located as a premier gateway to connect traditional markets and emerging markets across the world, matching the needs of both sides. Aside from being one of the top three international financial centres in the world, Hong Kong enjoys the advantages brought by the real-world economy and keen investment demand in the Chinese Mainland, turning the city into an enticing pool for global investment.

  He said, ""Just for the first eight months this year, we had 59 companies newly listed in our stock market of 2025, raising a total of EUR14.6 billion through IPOs (initial public offerings) and marking an upsurge of 579 per cent when compared to the same period last year. If you look at the net fund inflows from the Chinese Mainland to Hong Kong, we are talking about a sum close to EUR105.4 billion for the first eight months of 2025. Its turnover is equivalent to 24.5 per cent of our market's overall turnover and surpassing the historical annual levels. In Hong Kong, we have introduced various mutual access programmes to provide diverse asset allocation and risk management options for investors from around the world including Europe in accessing the immense opportunities fuelled by economic growth on the Mainland.

  ""Amid this stellar performance, our Chief Executive just announced in his Policy Address that more targeted initiatives would be rolled out to strengthen our capital market and unlock new areas of economic growth. Measures include attracting more Mainland enterprises to set up corporate treasury centres and more banks to establish their regional headquarters in Hong Kong; expediting the building of an international gold-trading market covering storage, gold refining, trading and clearing; refining policy measures like further enhancing the preferential tax regimes for funds, single family offices and carried interest to keep up the growth momentum of the fund and family office sector; as well as fostering development of fintech, and green and sustainable finance.""

  Mr Hui had a meeting with the Minister of Finance of Croatia, Dr Marko Primorac, on the sidelines of the conference. He also had some deeper exchanges with other panellists at the networking lunch hosted by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Slovenia, Mr Klemen BoštjanÄiÄ.

  In the afternoon, Mr Hui joined a business event organised by the Gospodarska zbornica Slovenije (GZS) which is the largest chamber of commerce and industry in Slovenia. The Slovenian-Chinese Business Council under the GZS aims to strengthen co-operation and business relations between the two countries and help Slovenian companies access the Mainland market.

  Mr Hui told the audience that there is no better time than now to capitalise on the advantages of Hong Kong as the perfect platform to enter the Asian and Chinese Mainland markets. With a world-renowned and robust regulatory regime, Hong Kong's financial markets offer the most stable and predictable environment that is aligned with international practices for investors. The world-class professional services available in Hong Kong can support enterprises to go far.

  The GZS will be leading a business delegation to visit Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland in early November this year, and so far over 50 companies have enrolled. Mr Hui said that it would definitely be a good occasion for Slovenian companies to see for themselves the vast opportunities in the region, and looked forward to future collaboration.

  On September 24 (Ljubljana time), Mr Hui will proceed to Warsaw, Poland, to continue his visit after having meetings with Mr BoštjanÄiÄ and Slovenia government officials."

財庫局局長在斯洛文尼亞財政部高級別會議上向歐洲財政部長展示香港優勢（附圖）,2025-09-24 11:40,2025-09-24 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092400273.htm,"財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇九月二十三日（盧布爾雅那時間）在斯洛文尼亞盧布爾雅那與歐洲各國財政部長及不同地區的金融專家一同出席高級別圓桌會議，並向他們展現香港集合中國與環球優勢於一城的無可比擬實力。他亦向斯洛文尼亞商界推介香港蓬勃的金融市場。

該高級別會議由斯洛文尼亞財政部主辦，以「釋放增長潛力：斯洛文尼亞和歐洲資本市場的未來」為題，匯聚克羅地亞、愛沙尼亞和斯洛文尼亞的財政部長、歐洲聯盟委員會金融服務和儲蓄與投資聯盟專員，以及眾多金融領袖和專家，分享真知灼見，共同推動歐洲資本市場邁向更美好的未來。

許正宇以講者身分參與了「環球資本市場的成功之道」專題討論環節。他表示，香港位處戰略性位置，是連接全球傳統市場和新興市場，契合雙方需求的首要門戶。除獲評為全球三大國際金融中心之一外，香港更受惠於中國內地實體經濟和熾熱的投資需求，成為注目的環球資金池。

他說：「單計今年首八個月，已有59家公司在港新上市，透過公開招股合共集資146億歐元，較去年同期增長579％。如果有留意南向交易流入香港的資金淨額，便會看到二○二五年首八個月的資金淨流入已接近1054億歐元，成交額相當於香港股票市場整體成交額的24.5％，超越以往的年度水平。香港有各種互聯互通項目，為包括歐洲在內的環球投資者提供多樣化的資產配置和風險管理選項，讓他們可抓緊內地經濟增長帶來的無限機遇。」

「香港經濟表現亮麗，行政長官剛在《施政報告》中宣布推出更多針對性措施去強化香港資本市場，開拓新的經濟成長點。這些措施包括吸引更多內地企業在香港設立企業財資中心，以及吸引更多銀行在香港設立地區總部；加快建設涵蓋倉儲、精煉、交易和清算的國際黃金交易市場；完善政策措施，例如進一步優化基金、單一家族辦公室和附帶權益的優惠稅制，以鞏固基金和家族辦公室行業的增長勢頭；以及促進金融科技、綠色和可持續金融的發展。」

會議期間，許正宇與克羅地亞財政部長Marko Primorac博士會談。他還出席了由斯洛文尼亞副總理兼財政部長Klemen Boštjančič舉辦的聯誼午宴，與其他講者深入交流。

下午，許正宇出席斯洛文尼亞最大商會－斯洛文尼亞工商協會（GZS）舉辦的商務活動。GZS旗下的斯洛文尼亞—中國商務委員會旨在加強兩國之間的合作與商貿關係，協助斯洛文尼亞企業進入中國市場。

許正宇表示，現在是善用香港優勢，借助香港這個理想平台進軍亞洲及中國市場的最佳時機。香港金融市場擁有世界知名的完善監管制度，為投資者提供最穩定、具可預見性且與國際慣例接軌的投資環境，而本港世界級的專業服務亦能支持企業走得更廣更遠。

GZS今年十一月初將率領商務代表團到訪香港和內地，至今已有逾50家公司報名參加。許正宇說，斯洛文尼亞的公司將可在到訪期間，親身了解香港和內地的龐大機遇，機會難得，期待它們屆時可以達成一些合作項目。

許正宇九月二十四日（盧布爾雅那時間）在與Boštjančič和政府官員會面後，會轉往波蘭華沙繼續訪問行程。"

勞工處發言人今日（九月二十四日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

勞工處印備了安全指南及單張，提供有關電力工作的安全指引。這些安全刊物可在該處各分區辦事處免費索取，亦可從該處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/content2_8.htm）下載。

  A spokesman for the LD said today (September 24) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

SFST discusses with Slovenian Deputy Prime Minister early commencement of CDTA negotiations (with photos),2025-09-23 21:32,2025-09-23 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/23/P2025092300908.htm,"  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, started his visit to Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, on September 22 (Ljubljana time) and welcomed Slovenia’s recognition of the benefits that a Comprehensive Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement (CDTA) with Hong Kong would bring to both economies.

  On the invitation of the Slovenia's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Mr Klemen BoštjanÄiÄ, Mr Hui will join a high-level roundtable conference hosted by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) of Slovenia for financial ministers and financial experts. At a welcome dinner hosted by Mr BoštjanÄiÄ for panellists held on September 22, Mr Hui was greeted with the good news that the Slovenian Government and National Assembly are deliberating on the decision to prioritise the CDTA with Hong Kong.

  ""It is reassuring to receive the encouraging response from the Slovenian Government soon after my initial proposal to Mr BoštjanÄiÄ this June that both sides are attaching importance in reaching a CDTA so that our business communities would be able to reap the tremendous benefits as soon as possible. With a CDTA in place, the business communities and residents of the two places will better understand the potential tax liabilities from cross-border investments, and enjoy avoidance of double taxation. This will be conducive to creating a more favourable and attractive business environment for investors to establish or expand their businesses. With the commitment of both sides, the first round of CDTA negotiations should be possible in the near future,"" he said.

  Earlier in the day, Mr Hui met with the Chairman of the Capital Market Authority (CMA) of Saudi Arabia, Mr Mohammed bin Abdullah Elkuwaiz, to update him on the situation of Hong Kong's financial market and the various initiatives announced in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" to consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The CMA is the regulator of the Saudi Arabian capital market, including the Saudi Stock Exchange, which is the only authorised entity allowed to carry out the trading of securities in Saudi Arabia.

  Mr Elkuwaiz has a great interest in Hong Kong's financial market and its various advantages. Mr Hui suggested enhanced co-operation between the two parties to help build the Saudi capital market into one of the most important financial markets in the world. He noted that the co-operation between the two financial markets is not new and Saudi Arabia can take the city as a reliable partner for investment and financial development. Collaboration between the two financial markets include the first Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) investing in the Saudi market listed in Hong Kong since 2023, two ETFs tracking Hong Kong stock indices on the Saudi Exchange since last year and the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding last year between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia to work jointly towards anchoring an investment fund of a target size of US$1 billion as well as the first Islamic bond (sukuk) ETF listed in Hong Kong this May.

  Mr Hui also paid a courtesy call on the Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Slovenia, Mr Zhao Binghui. They discussed the latest trend and opportunities of Mainland enterprises going global, and how Hong Kong can play its unique role to better serve the relevant needs.

  On September 23 (Ljubljana time), Mr Hui will attend a high-level roundtable conference hosted by the MoF of the Republic of Solvenia as well as a business event organised by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia. He will also meet ministers of finance from other countries on the sidelines of the Slovenian MoF roundtable conference."

應斯洛文尼亞副總理兼財政部長Klemen Boštjančič邀請，許正宇參加由該國財政部主辦的財政部長及金融專家高級別圓桌會議。許正宇在九月二十二日出席Boštjančič副總理兼財政部長為講者而設的歡迎晚宴時，欣悉斯洛文尼亞政府和國會正討論優先處理與香港磋商全面性協定的事宜。

他說：「今年六月，我向Boštjančič副總理兼財政部長提出初步建議，希望兩地應將簽訂全面性協定磋商視為重點項目，以讓兩地商界早日把握由此帶來的巨大機遇。斯洛文尼亞政府能迅速給予積極回應，實在令人鼓舞。當全面性協定簽訂後，兩地商界及居民會更清楚地了解跨境投資的潛在稅務負擔，並受益於避免雙重課稅，這將有助於締造更有利和具吸引力的營商環境，助力投資者建立或擴展業務。在雙方承諾下，相信首輪磋商可在不久的將來開展。」

許正宇同日較早時間與沙特阿拉伯資本市場管理局主席Mohammed bin Abdullah Elkuwaiz會面，向他介紹香港的金融巿場最新情況，以及《行政長官2025年施政報告》內有關鞏固香港國際金融中心地位的多項措施。該資本市場管理局負責監管沙特阿拉伯資本市場，當中包括沙特阿拉伯證券交易所（沙特交易所）。沙特交易所是當地唯一獲授權進行證券交易的機構。

Mohammed bin Abdullah Elkuwaiz對香港的金融巿場和優勢相當感興趣。許正宇建議雙方加強合作，助力沙特阿拉伯打造其資本巿場成為全球最重要的金融巿場之一。他指出，兩地金融市場的合作由來已久，沙特阿拉伯可以視香港為進行投資及發展金融的可靠合作夥伴。兩地金融巿場至今已有多項合作，包括首隻投資沙特阿拉伯市場的交易所買賣基金（ETF）於二○二三年已在香港上市；兩隻追蹤香港股票指數的交易所買賣基金自去年起在沙特交易所上市；香港金融管理局與沙特阿拉伯公共投資基金去年簽署諒解備忘錄，共同籌備一隻目標規模達10億美元的投資基金；以及首隻伊斯蘭債券交易所買賣基金今年五月在港上巿。

許正宇也拜會了中國駐斯洛文尼亞大使館臨時代辦趙炳輝。雙方討論了內地企業「出海」的最新趨勢和機遇，以及香港如何發揮獨有功能角色，服務好相關需求。

九月二十三日（盧布爾雅那時間），許正宇將出席由斯洛文尼亞財政部主辦的高級別圓桌會議，以及由斯洛文尼亞工商協會舉辦的商貿活動。他出席斯洛文尼亞財政部圓桌會議期間會與其他國家財政部長會面。"

鄧特抗教授在歐洲教育者年會暨展覽中的專題研討會上指出：「政府一直投放大量資源推動高等教育蓬勃發展，讓大學積極發揮培育人才及推動科研的重要角色，建立令香港引以為傲的國際聲譽。五所教資會資助大學躋身世界百強，六所名列亞洲五十強，四所位列全球最國際化大學首四強。香港的大學開辦的眾多課程均躋身世界一流行列。這反映香港在成為國際一流高等教育樞紐方面擁有穩固的基礎和獨特的優勢。香港亦將在二○二六年主辦亞太國際教育協會年會暨展覽。屆時，世界各地高等教育界領袖及代表將雲集香港，本港專上院校可藉此機會進一步提升與各地院校的合作交流。」

在香港主辦的晚宴招待會上，香港高等教育卓越教學聯盟的代表亦分享了高等教育界為應對即將來臨的挑戰推出的一些最新措施，這些措施充分展示香港教育界對卓越教學的承諾。

在外訪期間，鄧特抗教授與八所教資會資助大學的代表，於法國巴黎出席「法國—香港交流活動」，並與法國高等教育院校代表團會面。雙方就高等教育領域的最新發展深入交換意見，探討如何進一步鞏固並拓展法港的長期合作夥伴關係。

此外，鄧特抗教授亦分別在法國及德國與知名科研資助機構及學術機構的高層管理人員會面，就高等教育和科研領域的新興趨勢及合作機遇交換意見。他強調，香港高等教育界於科研方面的卓越成就備受國際肯定，在教資會的二○二○年研究評審工作結果中，香港約七成的研究成果達到國際卓越水平或以上。教資會轄下的研究資助局，透過多項資助計劃，以及與國內外研究資助機構合作，支持大型及尖端的科研項目工作。目前，香港與海內外逾70個國家及地區開展超過7 000項研究合作。這些成果彰顯了香港在推動科研發展堅定不移的決心。研究資助局亦會在二○二五年年底舉辦首屆「研究高峰會」，展示香港在研究方面的卓越表現，並促進研究人員之間的國際交流。

鄧特抗教授指出：「香港的優秀大學一直是歡迎世界各地頂尖學者和優秀學生的理想學術家園。作為國際專上教育樞紐及全球最具活力城市之一，香港誠意歡迎所有渴望實現學術夢想的人士前來，親身體驗香港可提供的學習和科研的機遇。」

二○二五年《施政報告》宣布各教資會資助大學授課課程的非本地生自費就學人數上限，自二○二六／二七學年起，將由現時相當於本地學生學額的百分之四十進一步提升至百分之五十。各大學可因應本身條件，循序漸進錄取更多非本地學生。此外，教資會資助研究院研究課程超額收生的上限，自二○二六／二七學年起亦將進一步放寬，由百分之一百增至百分之一百二十。這兩項措施將有助吸引更多優秀的人才來港深造及進行學術研究，進而打造香港成為國際高端人才集聚高地。"
"UGC Secretary-General visits Sweden, France and Germany",2025-09-23 19:58,2025-09-23 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/23/P2025092300835.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the University Grants Committee:

The Secretary-General of the University Grants Committee (UGC), Professor James Tang, led a delegation to visit Sweden, France and Germany from September 9 (Gothenburg time) to 19 (Frankfurt time) as part of efforts to promote Hong Kong's development into an international hub for post-secondary education.

Professor Tang, along with the delegation from all eight UGC-funded universities under the aegis of the Heads of Universities Committee's Standing Committee on Internationalisation (HUCOMSCI), attended the European Association for International Education (EAIE) Conference and Exhibition in Gothenburg, Sweden. During a dedicated session, Professor Tang presented the strengths and opportunities of Hong Kong's internationalised and diversified higher education environment that welcomes academics and students from around the world to pursue their aspirations in Hong Kong. With the funding support from the UGC, the HUCOMSCI also set up the Hong Kong Pavilion to promote the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand, support the publicity for recruiting overseas students to study in Hong Kong, and expand the international collaboration network.

Speaking at the session at the EAIE Conference and Exhibition, Professor Tang pointed out, ""The Government has been allocating abundant resources to propel the vibrant development of Hong Kong's higher education sector, supporting universities to step up their efforts in nurturing talent and advancing scientific research, garnering the international reputation that we take pride in. Five of the UGC-funded universities are ranked among the world's top 100, six within Asia's top 50 and four among the most international universities in the world. Many programmes offered by our universities are among the best worldwide. This reflects Hong Kong's solid foundation and unique strengths in becoming a premier international hub for post-secondary education. Meanwhile, the upcoming Asia-Pacific Association for International Education Conference and Exhibition in 2026, to be held in Hong Kong, will gather leaders and representatives from the higher education sector worldwide and offer local post-secondary institutions an opportunity to further enhance co-operation and exchanges with their counterparts around the world.""

At the Dinner Reception hosted by Hong Kong, the representative of the Hong Kong Teaching Excellence Alliance also shared some of the latest initiatives the Hong Kong higher education sector launched in the face of upcoming challenges, which showcased Hong Kong's education sector's commitment to teaching excellence.

During the duty visit, Professor Tang and representatives of the eight UGC-funded universities met with the delegation of French universities in Paris, France, at the France-Hong Kong Day. They exchanged views on the latest developments in the higher education sector and discussed how to deepen and consolidate the long-term France-Hong Kong collaboration.

Additionally, Professor Tang also engaged with senior management from prominent research funding and academic institutions in France and Germany to discuss emerging trends and collaboration opportunities in higher education and research. He highlighted that the remarkable research achievements of Hong Kong's higher education sector are well recognised worldwide, with some 70 per cent of Hong Kong's research outputs assessed as internationally excellent in the University Grants Committee's Research Assessment Exercise 2020. The Research Grants Council under the UGC supports large-scale research projects and cutting-edge work through various schemes and in collaboration with other research funding agencies both nationally and internationally. There are over 7 000 active research collaborations with more than 70 countries and regions on the Mainland and overseas. These achievements underscore Hong Kong's steadfast determination to advance research development. The first Research Summit organised by the Research Grants Council will take place at the end of 2025, showcasing Hong Kong's research excellence and facilitating international exchanges among researchers.

""Hong Kong's outstanding universities have been a welcoming academic home for top scholars and talented students from around the world. As an international hub for higher education, Hong Kong's doors are always open to all who want to realise their academic pursuits and experience the learning and research opportunities offered by one of the world's most dynamic cities,"" said Professor Tang.

As announced in the 2025 Policy Address, the enrolment ceiling for self-financing non-local students in taught programmes at UGC-funded universities will be further raised from the current level equivalent to 40 per cent of local student places to 50 per cent, effective from the 2026/27 academic year. Universities may progressively increase their intake of non-local students based on their individual circumstances. Moreover, the over-enrolment ceiling of UGC-funded research postgraduate programmes will be further increased from 100 per cent to 120 per cent starting from the 2026/27 academic year. These two initiatives will help attract more talented students to pursue their studies and research in Hong Kong, thereby building Hong Kong into an international hub for high-calibre talent."
