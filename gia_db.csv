Secretary for Health chairs 29th meeting of Research Council under Health Bureau (with photos),2025-09-12 17:45,2025-09-12 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200554.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, chaired the 29th meeting of the Research Council (RC) under the Health Bureau today (September 12) to review the research translation outcome of the Health and Medical Research Fund (HMRF), discuss the new research translation strategy of the HMRF, and consider the funding applications for investigator-initiated research projects received during the period from last December to March this year.

  Professor Lo said, ""If research findings can be successfully translated and truly applied, not only can they improve citizens' health and enhance public health standards, but also have the potential to develop into biopharmaceutical industry. This plays a pivotal role in addressing Hong Kong's increasingly complex health challenges.""

  He stressed, ""The HMRF is committed to promoting research translation and supports projects with clear translation potential. I am glad to see that HMRF-funded research projects not only brought a positive influence on healthcare policies and practices, but also supported researchers in generating new knowledge in the biomedical and healthcare realm to promote medical advancement. In addition, a number of HMRF-funded projects have successfully secured additional funding for subsequent research, enabling further development and translation of their findings. These fruitful results demonstrate that the HMRF is highly effective in promoting the translation of academic research into practical applications. The Government will continue to foster scientific research and innovation in healthcare through the HMRF, as well as support high-quality scientific research and innovative projects that demonstrate clear translational potential. At the same time, the Government will also develop new quality productive forces in the field of health and medical research, including capabilities in clinical trials and new drug development, with a view to developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub.""

  The RC was pleased to note the significant translation results and impacts of the HMRF-funded research, as revealed from the surveys conducted on 124 research projects in 2025. These include:

(i) Close to 70 per cent of the funded projects had their research findings published in peer-reviewed journals, showcasing that the HMRF is effective in supporting knowledge generation;

(ii) 40 per cent of the funded projects received additional funding support from the HMRF and other funding sources for subsequent research, with each project receiving an additional funding (excluding the HMRF) amounting to seven times that of the original HMRF grant on average;

(iii) Examples of applications in the formulation of healthcare policies and practices include:

(a) An HMRF-funded study found that an ortho-geriatric multidisciplinary care model for patients with fragility hip fractures led to better clinical outcomes, including shorter stays in acute and rehabilitation hospitals, less chest infections as complications, higher functional recovery at discharge, and improved system efficiency. This innovative service model has been widely adopted in the Hospital Authority (HA);

(b) Another HMRF-funded study evaluating the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of online cognitive behavioural therapy to treat anxiety and depression has informed the development of digital mental health platform under the Jockey Club TourHeart+ Project (JCTH+). Relevant research findings became an integral part of the counselling services of eight local tertiary institutions to develop a stepped care system with online-offline hybrid interventions to support students; and

(c) An HMRF-funded cohort study found that specific serum biomarkers could improve risk prediction of liver cancer in chronic hepatitis B patients receiving antiviral treatment. These findings informed the ""EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Management of Hepatitis B Virus Infection"" released by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) this year.

  Moreover, over the past year, 25 HMRF-funded projects reported to have patent applications for further development, including commercialisation. These projects covered a wide variety of health issues, including novel drug candidates, gene therapies, new vaccine platforms and other emerging technologies. Notably, an HMRF-funded project validated a novel mechanism to identify fertilisation-competent sperms. These findings further informed another HMRF-funded project and led to the development of the world's first artificial intelligence model to accurately and efficiently assess sperm fertilisation capacity to support assisted reproduction treatments. The model won a Silver Award at the 50th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva this year.

  At the meeting, the RC also endorsed the new research translation strategy of the HMRF. The strategy spans the entire research cycle and aims to further enhance the practical and translational value of HMRF-funded research. Over the past year, the HMRF consulted key stakeholders on the draft strategy, including academia, the public healthcare sector, healthcare professional bodies and community partners. The stakeholders expressed their support for the draft strategy and offered their views to make the new strategy more comprehensive. The new research translation strategy covers four priorities, namely: (i) to shape research translation culture; (ii) to build quality partnership; (iii) to promote end-of-grant translation; and (iv) to monitor and evaluate research outcomes.

  During the meeting, the RC also considered the funding applications for investigator-initiated research projects under the HMRF received from last December to March this year and endorsed a funding commitment of $219 million involving 205 projects. The exact details will be released to the applicants in late September.

  Professor Lo said, ""With the growing breadth and depth of HMRF research, I encourage researchers to continue to make full use of the HMRF to accelerate the translation of their research outcomes, with a view to fostering medical innovation and supporting the implementation of evidence-based healthcare policies and practices to benefit the general public.""

  Chaired by the Secretary for Health, the RC comprises members including representatives and professors from two medical schools and healthcare-related disciplines of various universities as well as representatives from the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, the Department of Health, the University Grants Committee and the HA. The RC provides strategic steer on funding for health and medical research and health promotion projects. It oversees the management of funds under the Health Bureau, including the HMRF, encompassing allocation of funding to approved projects."

該28名業主的罪行包括（一）沒有在規管租賃的租期開始後的60日內，向估價署署長提交租賃通知書（表格AR2）；及（二）要求租客支付不屬《條例》所准許的種類的款項（包括要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額）。

估價署於早前發現這些業主涉嫌違反《條例》的相關規定。經深入調查及搜集證據後，估價署向這些業主提出檢控。

估價署發言人重申，分間單位業主必須嚴格遵守《條例》下的相關規定，包括禁止業主刻意打擾租戶成員的安寧或舒適生活等，意圖使租客放棄佔用其分間單位；要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額；同時提醒租客在《條例》下所享有的權益，包括四年（即兩年加兩年）的租住權保障。他亦強調估價署會繼續堅決執法，打擊任何違例個案。估價署除了跟進舉報個案，亦一直以多管齊下的方式主動識別、調查及跟進有關業主涉嫌違反《條例》規定的個案。就此，估價署要求規管租賃的業主提供與租賃有關的資料及參考文件，以核實他們是否已遵從《條例》的規定。如業主無合理辯解而拒絕提供相關資料或忽略署方要求，即屬違法，最高可處第三級罰款（10,000元）及監禁三個月。因應實際情況和所蒐集的資料及證據，估價署會對個別個案採取適當行動，包括就涉嫌觸犯《條例》下罪行的個案提出檢控。此外，估價署已展開新一輪宣傳教育工作，加強宣傳《條例》下主要罪行及刑罰，並強調會主動審查業主有否觸犯《條例》下罪行。

28 landlords of subdivided units under regulated tenancies convicted of contravening relevant statutory requirements,2025-09-12 17:38,2025-09-12 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200668.htm," Twenty-eight landlords of subdivided units (SDUs), who contravened Part IVA of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7) (the Ordinance), pleaded guilty and were fined between $800 and $7,200, amounting to a total of $75,200, on September 5 and today (September 12) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. Since the Ordinance came into force, the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) has continuously strengthened enforcement actions and has prosecuted a total of 1 222 cases to date. Among the 859 cases dealt with by the court, all were successfully convicted, which involved a total of 747 SDU landlords, amounting to a total of $2,286,510. In addition, 363 cases are pending a hearing.

  The offences of these 28 landlords include (1) failing to submit a Notice of Tenancy (Form AR2) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation within 60 days after the term of the regulated tenancy commenced; and (2) requesting the tenant to pay money other than the types permitted under the Ordinance (including requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance).

  The RVD earlier discovered that the landlords failed to comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance. Upon an in-depth investigation and evidence collection, the RVD prosecuted the landlords.

  A spokesman for the RVD reiterated that SDU landlords must comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance, including prohibiting landlords from doing any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of members of the tenant's household, with the intention of causing the tenant to give up occupation of the SDU; or requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance, and also remindedtenants of their rights under the Ordinance, including a four-year (i.e. two years plus two years) security of tenure. He also stressed that the RVD will continue to take resolute enforcement action against any contraventions of the Ordinance. Apart from following up on reported cases, the RVD has been adopting a multipronged approach to proactively identify, investigate and follow up on cases concerning landlords who are suspected of contravening the Ordinance. In particular, the RVD has been requiring landlords of regulated tenancies to provide information and reference documents of their tenancies for checking whether they have complied with the requirements of the Ordinance. If a landlord, without reasonable excuse, refuses to provide the relevant information or neglects the RVD's request, the landlord commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine at level 3 ($10,000) and to imprisonment for three months. Depending on the actual circumstances, and having regard to the information and evidence collected, the RVD will take appropriate actions on individual cases, including instigating prosecution against suspected contraventions of the Ordinance. In addition, the RVD has started a new round of publicity and education work to enhance public awareness about the key offences and penalties, emphasising that the RVD proactively checks whether landlords have committed the offences under the Ordinance.

  To help curb illegal acts as soon as possible, members of the public should report to the RVD promptly any suspected cases of contravening the relevant requirements. Reporting can be made through the telephone hotline (2150 8303), by email (enquiries@rvd.gov.hk), by fax (2116 4920), by post (15/F, Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, 303 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon), or in person (visiting the Tenancy Services Section office of the RVD at Room 3816-22, 38/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, and please call 2150 8303 to make an appointment). Furthermore, the RVD has provided a form (Form AR4) (www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/ar4.pdf) on its website to facilitate SDU tenants' reporting to the RVD.

  The RVD reminds that pursuant to the Ordinance, a regulated cycle of regulated tenancies is to comprise two consecutive regulated tenancies (i.e. the first-term tenancy and second-term tenancy) for an SDU, and the term of each regulated tenancy is two years. A tenant of a first-term tenancy for an SDU is entitled to be granted a second-term tenancy of the regulated cycle, thus enjoying a total of four years of security of tenure. The RVD has been issuing letters enclosing relevant information to the landlords and tenants concerned of regulated tenancies in batches, according to the expiry time of their first-term tenancies, to assist them in understanding the important matters pertaining to the second-term tenancy, and to remind them about the procedures that need to be followed about two months prior to the commencement of the purported second-term tenancy as well as their respective obligations and rights under the Ordinance. These landlords and tenants may also visit the dedicated page for the second-term tenancy on the RVD's website (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html) for the relevant information, including a concise guide, brochures, tutorial videos and frequently asked questions. The landlords and tenants concerned are also advised to familiarise themselves with the relevant statutory requirements and maintain close communication regarding the second-term tenancy for handling the matters properly and in a timely manner according to the Ordinance.

  For enquiries related to regulated tenancies, please call the telephone hotline (2150 8303) or visit the RVD's webpage (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/our_services/part_iva.html) for the relevant information."

二零二五年第二季香港本地居民總收入及對外初次收入流量數字,2025-09-12 16:30,2025-09-12 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200426.htm,"政府統計處今日（九月十二日）發表二零二五年第二季的香港本地居民總收入及相關數字的初步統計數字。

二零二五年第二季以當時市價計算的香港本地居民總收入（指香港居民透過從事各項經濟活動而賺取的總收入）較上年同期上升5.2%至8,922億元。同季以當時市價計算的本地生產總值估計為7,852億元，按年升幅為3.7%。二零二五年第二季的本地居民總收入較本地生產總值多出1,070億元，相當於該季本地生產總值的13.6%，主要是由於投資收益淨流入。

扣除其間價格變動的影響後，二零二五年第二季的香港本地居民總收入較上年同期實質上升3.6%，而本地生產總值在同季實質上升3.1%。

二零二五年第二季的香港初次收入（主要包括投資收益）總流入為6,246億元，較上年同期上升4.8%，相當於該季本地生產總值的79.5%。與此同時，二零二五年第二季的初次收入總流出亦較上年同期上升2.3%至5,176億元，相當於該季本地生產總值的65.9%。

就投資收益流入的主要組成部分而言，直接投資收益較上年同期上升3.5%，主要是因為部分本地大型企業在外地的直接投資收益增加。證券投資收益較上年同期錄得19.4%的顯著升幅，主要是由於本地投資者獲取的非本地股權證券的股息收益增加及本地投資者獲取的非本地債務證券的利息收益增加。

就投資收益流出的主要組成部分而言，直接投資收益較上年同期上升3.1%，主要是由於部分大型跨國企業在本地的直接投資收益增加。證券投資收益顯著上升19.6%，主要是由於非本地投資者獲取的本地股權證券的股息收益增加及非本地投資者獲取的本地債務證券的利息收益增加。

按國家／地區分析，二零二五年第二季，中國內地繼續是香港初次收入總流入的最主要來源地，佔當季總流入的42.3%。其次是英屬維爾京群島，佔12.8%。在初次收入總流出方面，中國內地及英屬維爾京群島在二零二五年第二季繼續是最主要目的地，分別佔當季總流出的30.5%及21.8%。

其他資料

本地生產總值及本地居民總收入是量度經濟表現的緊密相關指標。本地生產總值指一個經濟體的所有居民生產單位的生產總值。本地居民總收入指一個經濟體的居民透過從事各項經濟活動而賺取的總收入，不論該等經濟活動是在該經濟體的經濟領域內或外進行。

二零二三年第三季至二零二五年第二季的本地居民總收入及按收入組成部分劃分的初次收入流量數字載列於表甲，而有關季度按選定主要國家／地區劃分的初次收入流入及流出的數字則分別載列於表乙（1）和乙（2）。

二零二三年及以後的本地生產總值和本地居民總收入數字，以及二零二四年及以後的初次收入流量數字，在納入更多數據後會作出修訂。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《二零二五年第二季本地居民總收入及對外初次收入流量》報告內。用戶可於政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1040005&scode=250）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

Hong Kong's Gross National Income and external primary income flows for the second quarter of 2025,2025-09-12 16:30,2025-09-12 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200491.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (September 12) the preliminary statistics on Hong Kong's Gross National Income (GNI) and related figures for the second quarter of 2025.

  Hong Kong's GNI, which denotes the total income earned by Hong Kong residents from engaging in various economic activities, increased by 5.2% in the second quarter of 2025 over a year earlier to $892.2 billion at current market prices. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP), estimated at $785.2 billion at current market prices in the same quarter, recorded a 3.7% increase over a year earlier. The value of GNI was larger than GDP by $107.0 billion in the second quarter of 2025, which was equivalent to 13.6% of GDP in that quarter, mainly attributable to a net inflow of investment income.

  After netting out the effect of price changes over the same period, Hong Kong's GNI increased by 3.6% in real terms in the second quarter of 2025 over a year earlier. The corresponding GDP in the same quarter increased by 3.1% in real terms.

  Hong Kong's total inflow of primary income, which mainly comprises investment income, estimated at $624.6 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and equivalent to 79.5% of GDP in that quarter, recorded an increase of 4.8% over a year earlier. Meanwhile, total primary income outflow, estimated at $517.6 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and equivalent to 65.9% of GDP in that quarter, also increased by 2.3% over a year earlier.

  As for the major components of investment income inflow, direct investment income (DII) increased by 3.5% over a year earlier, mainly due to the increase in earnings of some prominent local enterprises from their direct investment abroad. Portfolio investment income (PII) recorded a significant increase of 19.4% over a year earlier, mainly attributable to the increase in dividend income received by resident investors from their holdings of non-resident equity securities and the increase in interest income received by resident investors from their holdings of non-resident debt securities.

  Regarding the major components of investment income outflow, DII increased by 3.1% over a year earlier, mainly due to the increase in earnings of some prominent multinational enterprises from their direct investment in Hong Kong. PII increased significantly by 19.6%, mainly attributable to the increase in dividend payout to non-resident investors from their holdings of resident equity securities and the increase in interest payout to non-resident investors from their holdings of resident debt securities.

  Analysed by country/territory, the mainland of China continued to be the largest source of Hong Kong's total primary income inflow in the second quarter of 2025, accounting for 42.3%. This was followed by the British Virgin Islands (BVI), with a share of 12.8%. Regarding total primary income outflow, the mainland of China and the BVI remained the most important destinations in the second quarter of 2025, accounting for 30.5% and 21.8% respectively.

Further information

  GDP and GNI are closely related indicators for measuring economic performance. GDP is a measure of the total value of production of all resident producing units of an economy. GNI denotes the total income earned by residents of an economy from engaging in various economic activities, irrespective of whether the economic activities are carried out within the economic territory of the economy or outside.

  Figures of GNI and primary income flows analysed by income component from the third quarter of 2023 to the second quarter of 2025 are presented in Table A, while selected major country/territory breakdowns of primary income inflow and outflow for the same quarters are presented in Tables B(1) and B(2) respectively.

  Statistics on GDP and GNI from 2023 onwards and primary income flows from 2024 onwards are subject to revision when more data are incorporated.

  More detailed statistics are given in the report ""Gross National Income and External Primary Income Flows, Second Quarter 2025"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1040005&scode=250).

German I&T talent visit Hong Kong and Shenzhen to explore opportunities in twin cities (with photos),2025-09-12 16:00,2025-09-12 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200410.htm,"  Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE) arranged for a delegation of German innovation and technology (I&T) talent to visit Hong Kong and Shenzhen from September 9 to 12 to learn about the entrepreneurial ecosystem, industry support and I&T opportunities in both cities. The visit is aimed at attracting German delegation members to pursue development in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).

  The 18-member delegation visited the Hong Kong Science Park, the Shatin Communications and Technology Centre of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Center as well as the Qianhai International Talent Hub in Shenzhen, and exchanged views with representatives from Invest Hong Kong, local start-ups, and Mainland technology enterprises. The delegation also toured various landmarks in Hong Kong to experience the unique charm of Asia's world city.

  When meeting the delegation, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare,Mr Chris Sun, stated that talent and technology are the key engines driving high-quality economic and social development. He highlighted that Hong Kong leapt to fourth place globally and first in Asia in the World Talent Ranking, and that the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster was ranked first globally by the World Intellectual Property Organization, reflecting the high international recognition of Hong Kong's appeal to talent and the GBA's innovation capacity. The Government will continue to promote complementarity and synergy between Hong Kong and other cities in the GBA as well as facilitate the integration of technology and talent with a view to fostering the economic development of Hong Kong and contributing to the impetus of national development.

  Representatives from the German youth entrepreneurship organisation opined that it was exceptionally meaningful for them to establish a connection with the Government, and hoped that they could serve as a bridge between Hong Kong and Germany to enable more German talent to know about Hong Kong and expand into markets outside Europe. Some delegates said that Hong Kong's location at the heart of Asia, as well as its mature financial market and network of business partners with access to the vast markets of the GBA, make it conducive to starting or expanding a business. They found the visit useful in helping them understand the regional I&T ecosystem and said that they hoped to leverage Hong Kong's advantages to explore new opportunities in Asia.

  In June this year, HKTE visited Munich, Germany, and co-organised a pitch event on I&T and entrepreneurship with the local youth entrepreneurship organisation. Twelve winning I&T talents were selected. Mr Sun visited the city to officiate at the prize presentation ceremony and invited the winners, together with representatives from the organisation and judges of the event, to visit Hong Kong and other cities in the GBA.

  As of today, HKTE has completed about 70 outreach visits and hosted more than 170 talent promotional programmes on the Mainland and overseas. The office will enhance its external promotion, in consonance with the development of the eight centres, to recruit more global talent with diverse backgrounds, and provide comprehensive support services to assist incoming talent in integrating into Hong Kong, building the city into an international hub for high-calibre talent."

  Compared with the grading released last week, Approach Beach, Big Wave Bay Beach and Silver Mine Bay Beach have been upgraded from Grade 3 to Grade 2. Tai Po Lung Mei Beach has been changed from Grade 1 to Grade 2.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

Note 1: Lifesaving services are provided by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department at 27 gazetted beaches, marked with an asterisk (*) above, from September 1.

德國創科人才訪問香港和深圳　探索雙城創科機遇（附圖）,2025-09-12 16:00,2025-09-12 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200406.htm,"香港人才服務辦公室（人才辦）安排德國創科人才於九月九日至十二日訪問香港和深圳，探索兩地的創業生態、行業支援和創科機遇，吸引他們到粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）發展。

一行十八人的訪問團先後參觀香港科學園、香港賽馬會沙田通訊及科技中心、香港科技大學創業中心和深圳前海國際人才港，並跟投資推廣署代表、本地初創企業及內地科技企業交流。其間亦遊覽多個香港地標，感受亞洲國際都會的獨特魅力。

勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡與訪問團會面時指出，人才和科技是驅動經濟和社會高質量發展的核心動力，香港在世界人才排名躍升至全球第四位及亞洲首位，「深圳—香港—廣州」創新集群獲世界知識產權組織評為全球第一，反映香港對人才的吸引力及大灣區的創新能力在國際上獲得高度肯定。特區政府會繼續推動香港與其他大灣區城市的優勢互補，促進科技與人才融合，助力香港經濟發展，貢獻國家發展動能。

德國青年創業組織代表認為，與特區政府建立聯繫極具意義，期望能成為連接香港與德國的橋樑，讓更多德國人才認識香港，開拓歐洲以外的市場。多位訪問團成員指出，香港位處亞洲中心，擁有成熟的金融市場和企業夥伴網絡，背靠大灣區的龐大市場，有利創業或擴展業務，是次考察有助了解區內創科生態，期望藉着香港的優勢，發掘亞洲新機遇。

今年六月，人才辦訪問德國慕尼黑，聯同當地青年創業組織合辦創科創業提案大賽，選出12名得獎創科人才。孫玉菡到訪當地擔任頒獎嘉賓，並邀請他們與組織代表和活動評審前往香港及其他大灣區城市考察。

人才辦至今已完成超過70次外訪，在海內外舉辦超過170 場人才推廣活動，未來將加強對外宣傳，配合「八大中心」發展，招攬更多國際多元人才，並提供全方位支援服務，協助來港人才融入香港，打造香港成為國際高端人才集聚高地。"

DH to commence territory-wide Population Health Survey in September,2025-09-12 15:50,2025-09-12 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200352.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced today (September 12) that the territory-wide Population Health Survey (PHS) 2025/26 will begin on September 18. The PHS aims to collect pertinent information on the health status and lifestyles of the local population in order to update and enrich the Government's database on population health. The latest information will enable the Government to formulate evidence-based public health policies, allocate resources effectively, and develop public health services and programmes tailored to the needs of the local community.

This marks the fourth large-scale territory-wide survey of its kind since 2003. The survey includes a questionnaire and a health examination, targeting land-based non-institutionalised Hong Kong residents aged 15 or above. The DH will randomly select about 20 000 individuals to represent their households for the questionnaire. Among them, around 1 800 will be invited to undergo a free health examination to provide further health data.

The survey identifies trends in specific health conditions, informing the development of health promotion activities and disease prevention strategies. By participating in the survey, citizens can gain insights into their own health and its connection to lifestyle habits, promoting greater awareness of health and encouraging the adoption of healthy lifestyles, thereby contributing to the improvement of public health in the long run.

Questionnaire can be completed online or via household interview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Selected households will receive an invitation letter by post. Household representatives may choose to complete the questionnaire themselves through an online platform or the eHealth App. Alternatively, the DH can arrange for an interviewer to visit the household and assist with completing the questionnaire. In addition to household data and sociodemographic characteristics, the questionnaire covers a range of health information, including physical and mental health status, health behaviour and preventive health practices.

During the face-to-face interview, to assist household members to build a lifelong and comprehensive personal electronic health record, enable healthcare professionals to provide them with continuous healthcare services, and enable them to manage their own and their family members' health records through the eHealth App, the interviewer will assist them to register with eHealth. Moreover, with the consent of the respondents, the DH will deposit the completed questionnaires into their ""Personal Folder"" in eHealth, enabling them to retain and utilise relevant health information.

Free health examination
---------------------------

The DH will select around 1 800 respondents aged between 15 and 84 from those who have completed the questionnaires to undergo a free health examination at designated health examination centres. The examination includes physical measurements (weight, height, hip and waist circumference, and blood pressure) and testing (lipid profile, glycated haemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, haemoglobin, iron status, inflammatory markers, viral hepatitis, as well as sodium, potassium, creatinine and iodine in urine).

Respondents who completed the health examination will receive their laboratory reports. The DH will provide advice and referral letters to those with abnormal test results. The test reports will also be deposited in their personal eHealth accounts, enabling them to seek appropriate follow ups and treatment from their family doctors or district health centres.

All information will be kept strictly confidential
----------------------------------------------------

The data collected in the survey will be used solely for research and statistical purposes. Findings will be published in aggregate form. All personal data and contact information will be kept strictly confidential.

To prevent fraudsters, the DH reminds the public to pay attention to the following anti-fraud measures:

1. Only those who have received an invitation letter from the DH by post and have activated the online questionnaire will receive SMS or email notifications about the PHS.

SMS: The DH will only send SMS related to the PHS 2025/26 using the sender IDs ""#DH-PHS2025"" or ""#DH-PHS"". Members of the public should remain highly vigilant if they receive SMS from senders not starting with ""#"" or displaying a regular phone number.
Email: The DH will only send emails related to the PHS 2025/26 from the e-mail address ""noreply@ehr.gov.hk"".

2. All interviewers will wear a specific vest uniform and carry an ""Interviewer Identity Card"" issued by the DH for verification. If in doubt, the public may call the survey hotline (3900 1194) between 9am and 10pm daily to verify the identity of the interviewer.
3. Neither the DH nor the interviewers will ask members of the public for any bank account numbers or credit card information. They will not request money transfers in relation to this survey either.

Active participation will help improve public health policies
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The DH urged invited citizens to participate in the survey to help establish a representative database. This will enhance Hong Kong's public health policies and services, thereby better safeguarding the health of Hong Kong people.

For more details about the PHS, the public may visit the dedicated webpage (www.chp.gov.hk/phs2025_26_en), or call the enquiry line at 2426 5208 during office hours."

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on September 11 to noon today (September 12), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 273 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

Simon (Chairman of the Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, Mr Simon Chan), Rocky (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, Dr Rocky Cheng), æ¥å¥èé· (Director of the Department of Youth Affairs of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Yang Jian), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you once again at the Digital Entertainment Leadership Forum. Over the past few years, this Forum has firmly established itself as Hong Kong’s premier digital entertainment event, and one of the most influential platforms of its kind in Asia. It brings together industry leaders, creators, innovators and members of the public for a vibrant and stimulating exchange of ideas, also showcasing a rich tapestry of local and global innovations that are shaping the future of digital entertainment.

   ""AI-charged Adventure"" is a most fitting theme for the Forum this year. AI is a transformative force for nearly every aspect of our lives. In the realm of digital entertainment, AI is revolutionising the way we create and experience content. From automated scriptwriting and music composition, to smarter NPCs (non-playable characters) and ultra-realistic visuals in games, AI is speeding up production, lowering costs and delivering more personalised content that responds to user preferences. For instance, in the popular game ""Black Myth: Wukong"" (ãé»ç¥è©±ï¼æç©ºã), AI played a pivotal role in its production.

  Indeed, the opportunity is immense. Estimates suggest that in 2024, revenues in the global entertainment and media industry stood at around US$3 trillion, and will grow to US$3.5 trillion in 2029. AI is a key driver behind this. It is transforming content delivery models, lowering barriers to entry, curating new user experiences, and enabling more targeted and effective advertising.

  However, alongside these opportunities come important and timely questions. In a world increasingly shaped by AI, are we relying more - or less - on human ingenuity? Can we ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically? How do we guard against algorithmic bias, deepfakes and digital scams? And how do we protect intellectual property rights in the AI era?

  Addressing these questions requires thoughtful dialogue and collaboration across sectors. That is why forums like this one are so important. It provides a platform where stakeholders come together to explore opportunities and address challenges. I very much look forward to the insights and ideas arising from this forum, as distinguished speakers share their perspectives across a wide range of topics in this dynamic space.

  For our part, the Government is committed to driving innovation by AI. We have prioritised AI as a core industry, advancing on five fronts: data, algorithms, computing power, capital and talent.

Speech by FS at Digital Entertainment Leadership Forum 2025 (English only) (with photos),2025-09-12 14:55,2025-09-12 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200545.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Digital Entertainment Leadership Forum 2025 today (September 12):

Simon (Chairman of the Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, Mr Simon Chan), Rocky (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, Dr Rocky Cheng), æ¥å¥èé· (Director of the Department of Youth Affairs of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Yang Jian), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you once again at the Digital Entertainment Leadership Forum. Over the past few years, this Forum has firmly established itself as Hong Kong’s premier digital entertainment event, and one of the most influential platforms of its kind in Asia. It brings together industry leaders, creators, innovators and members of the public for a vibrant and stimulating exchange of ideas, also showcasing a rich tapestry of local and global innovations that are shaping the future of digital entertainment.

   ""AI-charged Adventure"" is a most fitting theme for the Forum this year. AI is a transformative force for nearly every aspect of our lives. In the realm of digital entertainment, AI is revolutionising the way we create and experience content. From automated scriptwriting and music composition, to smarter NPCs (non-playable characters) and ultra-realistic visuals in games, AI is speeding up production, lowering costs and delivering more personalised content that responds to user preferences. For instance, in the popular game ""Black Myth: Wukong"" (ãé»ç¥è©±ï¼æç©ºã), AI played a pivotal role in its production.

  Indeed, the opportunity is immense. Estimates suggest that in 2024, revenues in the global entertainment and media industry stood at around US$3 trillion, and will grow to US$3.5 trillion in 2029. AI is a key driver behind this. It is transforming content delivery models, lowering barriers to entry, curating new user experiences, and enabling more targeted and effective advertising.

  However, alongside these opportunities come important and timely questions. In a world increasingly shaped by AI, are we relying more - or less - on human ingenuity? Can we ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically? How do we guard against algorithmic bias, deepfakes and digital scams? And how do we protect intellectual property rights in the AI era?

  Addressing these questions requires thoughtful dialogue and collaboration across sectors. That is why forums like this one are so important. It provides a platform where stakeholders come together to explore opportunities and address challenges. I very much look forward to the insights and ideas arising from this forum, as distinguished speakers share their perspectives across a wide range of topics in this dynamic space.

  For our part, the Government is committed to driving innovation by AI. We have prioritised AI as a core industry, advancing on five fronts: data, algorithms, computing power, capital and talent. Cyberport is a key partner in this effort. It is home to Hong Kong’s AI Supercomputing Centre, and plays a vital role in supporting start-ups and fostering cross-sector innovation. Meanwhile, we are also keen to apply AI in our creative industries. A good example is the ""Future Animation"" programme launched by our Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency. This initiative supports local creative companies in using AI to produce short animations. Some of the works have good potential to be developed into full-length features.

  Ultimately, the success of Hong Kong’s digital entertainment sector comes down to people.

大灣區藝術展覽系列「水墨異重奏」--「疊境雙生」在廣州舉行（附圖）,2025-09-12 14:30,2025-09-12 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200263.htm,"康樂及文化事務署（康文署）轄下藝術推廣辦事處與深圳市前沿藝穗藝術中心共同籌劃的大灣區藝術展覽系列「水墨異重奏」，第三場展覽「疊境雙生」，由今日（九月十二日）至十月二十六日在廣州舉行，亦是第五屆粵港澳大灣區文化藝術節響應節目之一。香港藝術家邱榮豐以水墨為媒介，重塑傳統山水的境象，而另一個大灣區藝術家組合_.WAV_Studio_（曹雨西及劉曉江）通過數字技術，構建奇幻的山水世界。他們以不同媒介，打破傳統水墨藝術的時空和維度。

邱榮豐專注於水墨創作和研究。他的水墨作品如《Meta-5》、《Into V》、《回聲之上》和《山踪》，呈現不同的山水景色。另一水墨作品《蜃曲》，透過意象化的手法，把香港十八區具代表性的山島轉化為山水畫面。《山外山02》水墨裝置則通過全景式構圖，將香港南北兩邊的無人島，連綴成一道流動的山水境象。裝置的環形結構讓參觀者穿梭其間，透過多角度與距離的變化，體驗山水中移步換景的視覺和空間體驗。作品《軌》展示邱榮豐在黑暗環境，利用光軌記錄剪裁成圓塊的砂紙，在渲染水墨紙張上研磨的痕跡。

_.WAV_Studio_的作品涵蓋影片、裝置、互動和聲音藝術。《人工智能山水圖》系列透過學習數萬幅水墨作品，訓練出可無限生成的「山水繪畫機器」，同時借助三維物理模擬，帶來如「裸眼3D」般的沉浸體驗。《富春山居圖》把具備掃描功能的二維碼，轉化為可閱讀的山水景觀。《四時比鄰》系列把花木、岩石、水體與光影片段動態生成虛擬圖景，引導參觀者思考如何在算法與數據中重建對自然的感知。《高山流水經緯圖》則實時捕捉大灣區的山形脈絡，動態生成數碼山水。

展覽同時展出_.WAV_Studio與邱榮豐共同創作的《人工智能山水圖——邱榮豐聯合創作特別版》影片裝置。作品靈感源自邱榮豐的原作《千迴02》，其畫面張力與《人工智能山水圖》系列所呈現的「動態質感」高度契合，仿佛是算法生成影像中凝固的一瞬，顯示傳統筆墨與數字生成藝術互相映照。

展覽得到chi K11藝術空間的場地支持，於廣州市天河區珠江東路6號K11購物藝術中心四樓chi K11藝術空間舉行，免費入場。有關展覽詳情，可瀏覽藝術推廣辦事處網頁www.apo.hk/tc/web/apo/there_ink_art_ensembles_strata_and_symbiosis.html，和追蹤「距地藝術」Facebook專頁www.facebook.com/apo.there、Instagram專頁www.instagram.com/apo.there及微博專頁weibo.com/apothere。

"""Ink Art Ensembles"" Exhibition Series in the Greater Bay Area - ""Strata and Symbiosis"" staged in Guangzhou (with photos)",2025-09-12 14:30,2025-09-12 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200265.htm,"  Jointly organised by the Art Promotion Office under the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) and the Shenzhen Fringe Art Center, the third exhibition ""Strata and Symbiosis"" of the ""Ink Art Ensembles"" Exhibition Series in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) is on display from today (September 12) to October 26 in Guangzhou. It is also a contribution programme of the 5th Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Culture and Arts Festival. Hong Kong artist Ross Yau uses ink as a medium to reshape the imagery of traditional landscapes, while another GBA art group, _.WAV_Studio_(Cao Yuxi and Lau Hiu-kong), has created a fantastical landscape world through digital technology. Through different media, they break the temporal and spatial dimensions of traditional ink art.

 Yau focuses on ink creations and research. His ink artworks, such as ""Meta-5"", ""Into V"", ""Beyond the Echoes"", and ""The Trail of the Mountains"", reveal varied landscapes. Another ink artwork, ""Mirage Harmony"", metaphorically reconstructs the distinctive landforms of Hong Kong's 18 districts into a pictorial landscape. The ink art installation ""Mountains Beyond II"" constructs a cyclical landscape, connecting uninhabited islands from Hong Kong's southern and northern sides through a monumental composition. The circular installation allows viewers to walk through its space, engaging with shifting perspectives and distances to emulate the visual and spatial experience of scenery transforming with every step. His artwork ""Tracing"" shows traces left by a piece of sandpaper in a round shape rubbing against a sheet of ink-coloured paper through light trails in the dark.

 The artworks of _.WAV_Studio_ encompass video, installation, interactive and sound art. The series ""Shanshui by AI"" trains a ""landscape painting machine"" capable of infinite generation with tens of thousands of ink paintings, and makes use of three-dimensional physical simulation to create an immersive experience like ""glasses-free 3D"". ""Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains"" reinterprets the scannable QR code, transforming it into a readable landscape. The series ""Seasonal Proximities"" turns footage of flowers, trees, rocks, water bodies, and light and shadow into digital images, guiding viewers to consider how to rebuild perceptions of nature through algorithms and data. ""Longitude and Latitude Chart of High Mountains and Flowing Water"" captures real-time mountain terrain of the GBA to dynamically generate digital landscapes.

 The exhibition also displays a digital video installation co-created by _.WAV_Studio_ and Yau named ""Shanshui by AI - A Special Collaboration with Ross YAU Wing Fung"". It was inspired by Yau's original work ""Pouring II"". The visual tension in the artwork aligns seamlessly with the ""dynamic texture"" of the ""Shanshui by AI"" series, appearing frozen in time through algorithmically generated imagery. It shows traditional brushwork resonating with digitally generated art.

 The exhibition has venue support from chi K11 art space and is running at chi K11 art space at L4, Guangzhou K11 Art Mall (6 Zhujiang East Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou) with free admission. For details of the exhibition, please visit the website of the Art Promotion Office: www.apo.hk/en/web/apo/there_ink_art_ensembles_strata_and_symbiosis.html, and follow the ""apothere"" page on Facebook www.facebook.com/apo.there, Instagramwww.instagram.com/apo.there and Weibo weibo.com/apothere.

 The exhibition is also one of the activities in the Chinese Culture Promotion Series. The LCSD has long been promoting Chinese history and culture through organising an array of programmes and activities to enable the public to learn more about the broad and profound Chinese culture.

"HyD collaborates with Mainland, overseas railway experts and industry to formulate and update Hong Kong Railway Standards (with photos)",2025-09-12 14:01,2025-09-12 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200258.htm,"  The Highways Department today (September 12) held a signing ceremony for the Collaboration Charter of the Hong Kong Railway Standards to demonstrate the firm commitment of the Government and various sectors to jointly formulating and updating the Hong Kong Railway Standards. The ceremony was officiated by the Director of Highways, Mr Tony Yau. Mainland and overseas railway experts, representatives from relevant government departments (namely the Buildings Department (BD), the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD), Drainage Services Department (DSD), the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD), the Fire Services Department (FSD), the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Transport Department (TD)), the Building Technology Research Institute, as well as the MTR Corporation Limited joined as signatories.

  Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Yau remarked, ""This Collaboration Charter has established a solid foundation for cross-sector collaboration. Through the formulation and updating of the Hong Kong Railway Standards, it would lead Hong Kong's railway construction to create a new milestone."" He said that the nation's railway standards not only attain international benchmarks, but also take a leading position internationally in various aspects. The formulation and updating of the Hong Kong Railway Standards would actively draw reference to world-class railway specifications including those of the nation, and extensively absorb the best practices of the Mainland and overseas. By introducing the Mainland's design standards, building materials, equipment and construction specifications, a firm basis will be established for utilising the Mainland's construction methods, technologies and resources in railway construction. This would not only help to promote introduction of the Mainland's innovative machinery and building technologies by the local construction industry, but also enhance efficiency, shorten the construction period and reduce costs.

  He added that Hong Kong's standards have long aligned with international standards, and envisioned that the new Hong Kong Railway Standards would not only become the ""Greater Bay Area Standards"", but also aim to become one of the new ""World Standards"".

  The standards will first be applicable to the ongoing Northern Link project and the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link (Hung Shui Kiu-Qianhai) project, and will be progressively adopted in other railway projects.

  The three commitments of the Charter are:

1. support the formulation and launch of the new Hong Kong Railway Standards for application to railway projects;
2. drive the continuous enhancement and application of the Hong Kong Railway Standards; and
3. leverage the Hong Kong Railway Standards as a key pillar for pursuing excellence in building railway projects.

  To support the above objectives and streamline processing, the HyD would be authorised by the BD under the Buildings Ordinance (Cap.â¯123) to handle the approval process for new railway projects by setting up a dedicated team. The HyD is also actively collaborating with relevant government departments, including the BD, the CEDD, the DSD, the EMSD, the FSD, the HKPF and the TD, to introduce a digitalised approval platform for materialising the handling of the submission, review and approve of documents in a fully digital centralised manner, with a view to streamlining the current approval processing time by half, while significantly enhancing the efficiency of implementing new railway projects under strict assurance of safety and quality.

SFST's keynote speech at ReThink HK 2025 (English only) (with photos),2025-09-12 13:04,2025-09-12 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200306.htm,"Following is the keynote speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at ReThink HK 2025 today (September 12):

Chris (Founder & CEO of ReThink HK & The ReThink Foundation, Mr Chris Brown), Simon (Chief Executive Officer of Business Environment Council, Mr Simon Ng), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is a huge privilege to address you at ReThink HK 2025, part of our Hong Kong Green Week 2025 and a leading platform for sustainable business. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to ReThink for its visionary ""Innovating for Impact"" programme, which harnesses green technology, AI and also data to drive sustainability. This initiative resonates deeply with the Government's commitment to leveraging technologies to achieve our carbon neutrality goal by 2050, for example through innovations in sustainable energy, buildings and climate solutions. Your collective efforts - participants, partners and stakeholders - are pivotal in advancing our shared environmental, social and governance (ESG) ambitions, setting the stage for a transformative journey towards a greener future.

Aligning with national and local Sustainability Goals

This journey is guided by a clear vision from the Central People's Government, as outlined in the 14th Five-Year Plan, which targets a peak in carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Hong Kong is also fully committed and we are pledging to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050 and reduce carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2035. These ambitious targets are not just aspirations but a call to action, driving us to lead by example in sustainable development. To realise this vision, we are leveraging our strengths as a global financial hub to pioneer innovative financing solutions, seamlessly connecting our environmental goals with our financial expertise.

Pioneering green finance in Asia

Building on this foundation, Hong Kong has solidified its position as Asia's premier green finance hub. Last year, our green and sustainable debt market surpassed US$84 billion, with green bonds alone contributing US$43 billion, securing 45 per cent of the regional market and maintaining our leadership as Asia's top green bond market for the seventh consecutive year since 2018. This financial prowess enables us to fund transformative projects that align with our carbon neutrality objectives.

Under the Government Sustainable Bond Programme, we have issued green bonds totaling HK$240 billion since May 2019. Milestones include the world's largest retail green bond back in 2022, Asia's largest multi-currency ESG bond in 2023, the first tokenised government green bond in 2023, and the world's first multi-tranche digitally native green bonds in 2024. These initiatives have supported 116 local green projects, with the forthcoming 2025 Green Bond Report, due this month, providing transparent insights into their environmental impact.

Complementing this, the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme, also launched by the Government, extended to 2027, has disbursed over HK$370 million to support over 600 green and sustainable debt instruments, with a total issuance exceeding HK$1.3 trillion. These efforts not only drive decarbonisation but also reinforce Hong Kong's role as a global leader in transition financing, bridging our sustainability goals with innovative financing.

Empowering talent for a sustainable future

To sustain this momentum, we recognise that innovation in particular requires skilled talent. Our three-year Pilot Green and Sustainable Finance Capacity Building Support Scheme provides subsidies of up to HK$10,000 for practitioners, students and graduates to develop expertise in green finance. Over 7 600 applications across 95 eligible programmes have been approved, with HK$42 million reimbursed. By extending this scheme to 2028, we are ensuring a robust pipeline of talent to drive our green finance agenda forward. This investment in human capital directly supports the innovative financing models that underpin our green bond initiatives and sets the stage for technological advancements in sustainability.

Fostering green fintech innovation

Technology is critical in terms of being an enabler of this vision, and Hong Kong is at the very forefront of integrating financial technology with green finance. The Hong Kong Green FinTech Map 2025, launched in June 2025 by our Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group, builds on last year's prototype to enhance the visibility of green fintech companies. Right now, we have more than 60 of those companies as the potential partners to work with ReThink going forward. Additionally, the Green and Sustainable Fintech Proof-of-Concept Funding Support Scheme, launched in June last year, provides subsidies to technology companies and research institutes. With 39 applicants and 60 projects approved, this initiative fosters collaboration and innovation, echoing ReThink's focus on AI and green technology. These fintech advancements enhance the efficiency and scalability of our green finance initiatives, creating a dynamic ecosystem that drives sustainable progress.

Ensuring transparency in sustainability

Transparency is the cornerstone of this ecosystem, ensuring trust and accountability. In March last year, we published a vision statement for a comprehensive sustainability disclosure ecosystem. The Hong Kong Sustainability Disclosure Standards, issued in December last year by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and also fully aligned with ISSB Standards(International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure Standards), became effective in August this year, ensuring global consistency in reporting. Also, the Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure mandates publicly accountable entities to adopt the ISSB standards by 2028, while the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, covering 12 economic activities, standardises green classification to reduce greenwashing risks. Phase 2 development has commenced under which the scope of sectors and economic activities will be expanded to introduce transition activities and add new green activities. These disclosure and classification systems provide the clarity needed to attract investment and support the innovative financing models driving our green bond and fintech initiatives.

Broadening access and engagement

To ensure inclusivity in our sustainability efforts, we are enhancing market accessibility. In February last year, in collaboration with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, which is also a partner of ReThink, we launched free greenhouse gas emissions calculation tools, empowering small and medium enterprises to manage their environmental impact. Additionally, the HKEX (Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited)'s Core Climate platform, the only international carbon marketplace offering HKD and RMB (Renminbi) settlement, attracted 100 participants by the end of last year. Partnerships with Mainland China's Beijing and Shenzhen Green Exchanges further strengthen regional collaboration, aligning with our taxonomy and disclosure frameworks to foster a dynamic carbon market. These initiatives broadened access to sustainability tools, ensuring that all sectors can contribute to our shared goals, much like the collaborative spirit of ReThink's ""Innovating for Impact"" programme.

A unified call to action

Hong Kong's leadership in green finance is a testament to our ability to unite vision, innovation and collaboration. ReThink HK 2025's focus on AI, green technology and data mirrors our commitment to leveraging cutting-edge solutions to achieve a sustainable future. From our ambitious carbon neutrality targets to our pioneering green bonds, fintech innovations and transparent disclosure systems, every step along the way we take as the interconnected step to build a resilient and inclusive ecosystem. I urge all of you to join us in translating this vision into action, harnessing the power of innovation to create a greener, more sustainable Hong Kong and beyond together.

Thank you."

EPD responds to Ombudsman's direct investigation report,2025-09-12 11:12,2025-09-12 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091100550.htm,"  The Office of the Ombudsman today (September 12) released a report on its direct investigation into the illegal disposal problem and the ""HoHoSkips"" recycling service for construction waste.

  A spokesperson for the Environmental Protection Department (EPD)said, ""The Department's efforts in combating the illegal disposal of construction waste in recent years have shown significant results. The amount of illegally disposed construction waste cleared by the Government has significantly decreased from the peak of around 9 000 tonnes in 2017 to about 1 000 tonnes between 2022 and 2024 (see Annex), representing a reduction of about 89 per cent. In some previous illegal disposal blackspots, such as the areas around Arran Street in Mong Kok and Wang Wo Tsai Street in Tsuen Wan, the reduction in the amount of illegally disposed construction waste has even exceeded 90 per cent.""

  The Office has recognised the EPD's efforts and effectiveness in combating the illegal disposal of construction waste, as well as its use of smart technology to assist law enforcement. The report suggested a series of measures to further enhance the effectiveness of combating the illegal disposal of construction waste and the ""HoHoSkips"" service.

  The EPD expressed its appreciation for the suggestions and will actively follow up in five directions, namely, reviewing ways to strengthen enforcement against illegal disposal of construction waste; strengthening promotional efforts on proper handling of construction waste; reviewing and enhancing the ""HoHoSkips"" service to increase efficiency, including the expansion of the ""Smart HoHoSkips"" recycling service; optimising the ""HoHoSkips"" mobile application and webpage; and collecting feedback from users to improve the ""HoHoSkips"" service.

  The EPD will continue to regularly review the operational data of the surveillance camera systems and related intelligence, and flexibly adjust the system distribution. It will also continue to deploy law enforcement actions and carry out promotional activities in areas with frequent small-scale renovation works and building maintenance activities, aiming to strengthen deterrence, improve enforcement efficiency and increase prosecution success rates. Moreover, the EPD has already initiated follow-up actions with the respective recycling organisation to implement enhancement measures for the ""HoHoSkips"" service as soon as possible to improve users' experience."

​申訴專員公署公布就非法棄置建築廢物問題及「好好斗」回收服務的主動調查行動報告（附圖）,2025-09-12 11:00,2025-09-12 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091100734.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（九月十二日）宣布完成非法棄置建築廢物問題及「好好斗」回收服務的主動調查行動，並向環境保護署（環保署）提出共15項改善建議。

建築工程和一般裝修工程均會產生不少建築廢物。當局自二○○六年起實施建築廢物處置收費計劃，建築廢物產生者須繳交廢物處置費用，並有責任妥善處置建築廢物。然而，公署留意到，不時有傳媒報道及市民投訴有建築廢物被胡亂棄置在公眾地方，有關違法行為對市民及道路使用者構成不便及安全隱患，亦影響環境衞生。為此，環保署以多管齊下的措施打擊非法棄置建築廢物的問題，並於二○二一年二月推出先導計劃，為市民及中小型裝修工程業界提供有效益的建築廢物收集途徑。市民及業界可透過「好好斗」流動應用程式，預約由回收基金資助的回收機構，妥善處理建築廢物。

公署調查發現，經過環保署多年來努力不懈，包括加裝監察攝錄系統、成立航拍機隊、加強巡查、與其他部門協調及訂立優先處理地點名單以加強監察等，以及現屆政府着力增加打擊力度並於二○二三年將定額罰款金額由1,500元大幅提高至6,000元，政府近年清理的非法棄置建築廢物數量已由二○一七年的9 000公噸大幅下降至二○二二年至二○二四年的每年約1 000公噸，經環保署核實的非法棄置建築廢物個案數目亦從二○二二年的4 612宗下降38%至二○二四年的2 841宗，反映當局的工作取得相當成效，值得充分肯定。

陳積志表示︰「街道上堆積非法棄置的建築廢物一直是市民關注的問題。我注意到近年有關情況有明顯改善，顯示當局的工作具實質成效，而『好好斗』回收服務計劃的使用率去年亦增加至76%，有更多市民使用該服務處置建築廢物。」

公署主動調查行動中發現，市民就非法棄置建築廢物的相關投訴仍維持每年一千多宗。在投訴個案中，經環保署核實的非法棄置建築廢物個案由近年的五、六百宗增加至二○二四年接近800宗。此外，公署人員在實地視察及跟隨環保署人員行動時，不難發現街上確有被棄置的建築廢物。資料亦顯示，二○一九年至二○二四年期間，環保署平均每年提出約102宗檢控個案；即使以檢控宗數最多的二○一九年來計算，該年度的檢控率仍只有3.8%。由此可見，環保署就非法棄置建築廢物個案的檢控率極低。公署認為，為進一步打擊非法棄置建築廢物的違法行為，環保署應檢視如何進一步加強執法及蒐證效能。

就「好好斗」回收服務計劃方面，根據環保署資料，二○二三年的服務使用率為62.5%，但同時該年有27.8%的申請被取消是因回收機構在高峰時段的服務供不應求所致，可見當時服務計劃的運作規劃及資源分配未能完全配合服務使用者的實際需要。在公署展開調查後，環保署已就服務的預約申請程序作出改善，讓用戶得悉某時段的預約量是否已滿，並顯示可供預約的時段供其考慮。

回收機構在二○二四年提供的收集服務比二○二三年增加了1 062次，服務使用率亦上升至76%，而在二○二四年因回收機構日程已滿而取消的預約申請的百分比亦下跌至12.1%，顯示「好好斗」回收服務的資源運用情況在最近有顯著改善。從二○二四年增加的收集服務次數及使用率可見，市民對「好好斗」回收服務計劃的需求持續。公署認為，環保署應計劃在新回收機構接手後，適時檢視「好好斗」的服務使用率，並研究如何更善用資源，包括壓縮整體個案的平均處理時間，以進一步提高「好好斗」服務的可服務次數，令公帑得以善用及更多服務使用者受惠。公署亦建議環保署密切留意「好好斗」回收服務的需求變化，若服務需求持續上升，便應考慮增加回收車數量及人手以應付增加的需求。

陳積志表示︰「雖然當局處理非法棄置建築廢物的工作有成效，但環保署的極低檢控率、經環保署核實的非法棄置建築廢物投訴個案不跌反升、『好好斗』回收服務的實際數據等顯示，該署的執管效能及檢控、『好好斗』回收服務的運作及程序等，均有可改善之處。公署期望環保署繼續加強執管、改善『好好斗』回收服務計劃的運作及服務供求情況，務求更有效打擊問題及善用資源。」

公署向環保署提出的主要改善建議包括：


應檢視如何進一步加強執法及蒐證效能，例如利用更多及更高科技協助及優化蒐證工作、靈活調配人手進行針對性巡查和突擊行動等，以提升檢控率及阻嚇力；
應考慮在有較大機會出現違法行為的地方，如區內新落成的屋苑，及進行維修或翻新工程的大廈和店鋪附近，針對性地加強巡查和監察，以收重點打擊之效；
聯同「好好斗」回收服務計劃的回收機構探討如何將高峰時段的服務需求轉移至非高峰時段的其他可行方法；
計劃在新回收機構接手後，適時檢視「好好斗」的服務使用率，並研究如何更善用資源，以提高高峰時段可服務的次數，並減少申請被取消的情況；
應與回收機構研究如何壓縮整體個案的平均處理時間，例如更有效地規劃收集路線，以縮短每宗個案所需的交通時間，從而提高資源的運用效率，得以處理更多的回收申請；並分析以往預約申請的地區分佈，考慮可否在通常較多預約申請的地區提供定點定時的收集服務；
密切留意「好好斗」回收服務計劃的需求變化，若服務需求持續上升，應考慮增加回收車數量及相關人手以應付增加的需求，特別是較易在路邊停泊的小型客貨車的數量；
應考慮主動聯絡「好好斗」服務使用者及業界，或在「好好斗」流動應用程式加入收集使用者意見的功能，收集有用意見以改善服務；
應檢視及改善「好好斗」流動應用程式的「使用者守則」及有關計劃網頁的內容，添加使用者須注意的其他重要事項，包括說明取消預約申請的後果，以減少預約申請被取消的情況，亦有助使用者正確及暢順地使用回收服務；以及
應提醒及監督回收機構盡早就涉及服務變更的資訊於網頁及流動應用程式作出通知，以減低對服務使用者的影響。


公署欣悉環保署接納公署提出的所有改善建議。

"Ombudsman announces results of direct investigation operation into illegal disposal of construction waste and ""HoHoSkips"" recycling service (with photo)",2025-09-12 11:00,2025-09-12 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091100737.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (September 12) announced the completion of a direct investigation operation into the illegal disposal of construction waste and the ""HoHoSkips"" recycling service, with 15 improvement recommendations made to the Environmental Protection Department (EPD).

Construction works and general renovation works inevitably generate a considerable amount of construction waste. Under the Construction Waste Disposal Charging Scheme implemented since 2006, construction waste producers are required to pay for waste disposal and have a duty to dispose of waste properly. Nevertheless, there have been media reports and public complaints from time to time about illegal disposal of construction waste in public places. Such illegal activities not only cause inconvenience and safety hazards for the public and road users but also affect environmental hygiene. In this connection, the EPD has adopted multipronged measures against illegal disposal of construction waste. In February 2021, it also launched a pilot scheme to provide the public and small-to-medium renovators with an effective way for collection of construction waste. Through the ""HoHoSkips"" mobile application, members of the public and the trade can book the service of the recycler subsidised by the Recycling Fund for proper disposal of construction waste.

The Office's investigation revealed that the EPD has spared no effort over the years which included the installation of surveillance camera systems, establishment of a drone fleet, enhanced patrolling, collaboration with other departments, and compilation of a list of priority sites for reinforced surveillance. Coupled with the current-term Government's more stringent enforcement and hiking the fixed penalty from $1,500 to $6,000 in 2023, the quantity of illegally disposed construction waste cleared by the Government dropped substantially from 9 000 tonnes in 2017 to around 1 000 tonnes per year between 2022 and 2024. The number of illegal disposal cases confirmed by the EPD fell by 38 per cent, from 4 612 cases in 2022 to 2 841 cases in 2024. These figures reflect the substantive results of the enforcement efforts of the Administration, which are certainly commendable.

Mr Chan said, ""The illegal disposal of construction waste on the roadside has been a problem widely concerned by the public. I notice the marked improvement in recent years, which indicates that the authorities' efforts are effective. The usage rate of the 'HoHoSkips' scheme increased to 76 per cent last year, meaning more people have used the service to dispose of construction waste.""

The Office's direct investigation operation revealed that public complaints about illegal disposal of construction waste stand at over 1 000 cases annually. Among the complaints, the number of illegal disposal cases confirmed by the EPD increased to nearly 800 in 2024 from the level of 500 to 600 a few years ago. Furthermore, during the Office's site inspections and shadowing of the EPD's operations, it was not uncommon to find construction waste dumped on streets. Statistics also show that between 2019 and 2024, the EPD instigated an average of around 102 prosecution cases annually. Even in 2019, the year with the highest number of prosecution cases, the prosecution rate was only 3.8 per cent, indicating that the EPD's prosecution rate against illegal disposal of construction waste is extremely low. The Office urges the EPD to review how to further strengthen its enforcement and evidence-gathering effectiveness to improve deterrence against illegal disposal of construction waste.

The EPD's data shows that the usage rate of ""HoHoSkips"" service was 62.5 per cent in 2023, but 27.8 per cent of the cancelled bookings in the same year were due to insufficient capacity of the recycler to meet the demand at peak times, reflecting a mismatch between the operational planning and resource allocation under the scheme and the actual needs of users at that time. Following the launch of this investigation, the EPD has improved the booking process by allowing users to view whether a time slot has been fully booked and showing alternative available slots for their consideration.

In 2024, the recycler made 1 062 more collections than in 2023, raising the service usage rate to 76 per cent. The percentage of cancellations due to overbooking also dropped to 12.1 per cent in 2024, indicating a significant improvement in the usage of ""HoHoSkips"" resources recently. The increase in the number of collections and usage rate in 2024 shows that public demand for the ""HoHoSkips"" service remains strong. The Office recommends that the EPD conduct timely review of the usage rate after the takeover of ""HoHoSkips"" service by a new recycler, and explore ways of better resource allocation, including shortening the average handling time per case to increase available service under the scheme. This will ensure better use of public funds for the benefit of more users. The Office also recommends that the EPD closely monitor changes in the demand for the ""HoHoSkips"" service. If demand continues to rise, the EPD should consider increasing the number of collection vehicles and manpower to meet the growing demand.

Mr Chan said, ""Despite the positive results achieved by the authorities against illegal disposal of construction waste, there is still room for improvement in the EPD's enforcement effectiveness and prosecution, as well as the operation and procedures of the 'HoHoSkips' service, in view of the extremely low rate of prosecution, increase rather than decrease in the number of illegal disposal complaints confirmed by the EPD, and the actual statistics of the 'HoHoSkips' service. We urge the EPD to continue stepping up enforcement and enhance the operation of the 'HoHoSkips' scheme and the supply and demand for its service, thereby further combating illegal disposal of construction waste and optimising the use of resources.""

The Office's major recommendations for improvement to the EPD include:


explore how to further strengthen its enforcement and evidence-gathering effectiveness, such as by making greater use of more advanced technologies to assist and optimise evidence collection, and flexibly deploying staff for targeted inspections and blitz operations, so as to improve prosecution rate and deterrence;
consider reinforcing patrols and surveillance in areas where offences are more likely to occur (such as in the vicinity of newly completed housing estates, and buildings and shops with renovation or repair works in progress) to achieve more targeted enforcement;
work with the recycler of the ""HoHoSkips"" scheme to explore feasible ways of shifting service demand from peak to off-peak times;
conduct timely review of the usage rate after the takeover of ""HoHoSkips"" service by a new recycler, and explore ways of better resource allocation to increase available service at peak times and minimise cancellations;
work with the recycler to shorten the average handling time per case (such as shortening the travel time per case by better route planning), so as to optimise the use of resources and accommodate more bookings; analyse the geographic distribution of past bookings, and consider offering collection service at fixed times and locations in districts with high demand;
closely monitor changes in the demand for the ""HoHoSkips"" service; if demand continues to rise, consider increasing the number of collection vehicles and manpower to meet the growing demand, particularly the number of light goods vehicles that are easier to park by the roadside;
consider engaging with ""HoHoSkips"" users and the trade, or incorporate a feedback feature into the ""HoHoSkips"" mobile app to gather useful input for service improvement;
review and improve the content of both the user guidelines on the ""HoHoSkips"" mobile app and its website, adding important information for the attention of users (including the consequences of cancelling a booking) to minimise cancellations, as well as to ensure correct and smooth use of the recycling service; and
remind and supervise the recycler to promptly announce any service-related changes via both website and mobile app to minimise disruption to users.


The Office is pleased to note that the EPD has accepted all of the improvement recommendations.

Please broadcast the following as soon as possible:

The Hong Kong Observatory has issued the Very Hot Weather Warning.

To prevent heat stroke, avoid prolonged activities outdoors.

If engaged in outdoor work or activities, wear a wide-brimmed hat and light-coloured, loose-fitting clothes. Stay in shaded areas as much as possible.

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-12 06:45,2025-09-12 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091100943.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 12) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

葉劉淑儀致辭時憶述，28年前她出任入境處處長期間，正值香港回歸祖國。儘管面臨種種未知之數及挑戰，入境處同事依然克盡己任，發揮專業精神，迎難而上，最終完成多項工作，確保交接順利。她表示，入境處團隊已由當年約5000人擴展至現時近9000人，是香港特別行政區（特區）主要執法隊伍之一。此外，入境處的工作也日趨多元化，除了在市民人生不同階段為他們提供服務外，更積極推行各類吸引人才的入境計劃，並為在境外遇事的香港居民提供協助等。她相信入境處定能繼續與時並進，精益求精，善用創新科技，進一步提升工作效率及服務水平，以更好配合社會的發展及市民的需要。

  During the parade, the Immigration Band played multiple pieces of Chinese military band music, patriotic songs and pop classics, whereas the Guard of Honour assembled to form the logo of the Skytrax Award to celebrate the Immigration Department (ImmD)'s winning of the 2025 Skytrax Award for the Best Airport Immigration Service, demonstrating the ImmD's determination to become the foremost immigration service in the world in effectiveness and efficiency.

  In her speech, Mrs Ip recalled that she had taken up the post of Director of Immigration 28 years ago amidst Hong Kong's return to the motherland. In the face of unknowns and obstacles, staff of the ImmD remained committed to their duties and rose to the challenges with professionalism, leading to the completion of numerous tasks and eventually a smooth transition. She noted that the ImmD has grown from a team of around 5000 back then to be close to 9000 today, making it one of the key law enforcement agencies in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Furthermore, the work of the ImmD has become increasingly diverse. In addition to providing services to members of the public at different stages of life, the ImmD has also been actively implementing various admission schemes to attract talent and providing assistance to Hong Kong residents in distress outside Hong Kong, among others. She said she believes that the ImmD would continue to keep pace with the times and strive for excellence, while leveraging innovative technologies to further enhance its work efficiency and service standards, so as to better cater for the development of society and the needs of the public.

  She also remarked that, as Hong Kong's ""first line of defence"", the ImmD has an important role to play in safeguarding national security and social stability. Immigration officers should follow through a holistic approach to national security and support the work of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR. They should also proactively identify suspicious individuals and avert risks endangering national security.

  Finally, Mrs Ip encouraged the graduates to always uphold the ImmD's values of ""Patriotism and Perseverance"" as well as ""Improvement and Illumination"", and be mindful of the constitutional duty embodied in the epaulettes on their uniforms. She was confident that the graduates would contribute to the country and society in the days to come, creating a bright future for both themselves and their families."

大家好！今晚很榮幸出席香港宗教界慶祝國慶籌備委員會舉辦的香港宗教界慶祝中華人民共和國成立七十六周年大會，與各方友好一同分享國慶的喜悅。

每年十月一日的中華人民共和國國慶日，對我們中國人而言都意義深遠。七十六年來，全國各族人民同心同德、艱苦奮鬥，讓國家的經濟和國力不斷提升，取得令世界刮目相看的偉大成就。

今年也是抗戰勝利80周年，國慶日的意義更為重大。香港六宗教領袖座談會上個月也舉辦了紀念會，祈願世界和平、尊重國家主權及民族平等，並呼籲各界以和平溝通、平等對話的方式解決分歧。從80年前迎來勝利後的百廢待興，到今天的國富民強、國泰民安，更令我們珍惜和平，明白發展和國家安全互為依存。上星期三，我極其榮幸獲得邀請在天安門廣場參加了勝利80周年大會的隆重儀式，現場聽取習近平主席發表重要講話和觀看大閱兵。習主席表示：「歷史警示我們，人類命運休戚與共，各個國家、各個民族只有平等相待、和睦相處、守望相助，才能維護共同安全，消弭戰爭根源，不讓歷史悲劇重演﹗」主席總結說：「中華民族偉大復興勢不可擋﹗人類和平與發展的崇高事業必將勝利﹗」如今，我國欣欣向榮，在經濟、科技、基建、文化和體育等多個領域取得舉世矚目的成就，已是全球第二大經濟體、第一大工業國、第一大貨物貿易國和第一大外匯儲備國。國家必定越來越強盛，香港的未來也必定越來越璀璨。

香港宗教界一直和衷共濟。六宗教團體向來致力促進彼此的交流合作，團結一心發揮力量。早在一九七八年，香港六宗教領袖座談會成立，自此一直關心各項社會、民生和宗教議題，亦舉辦不同跨宗教活動，加深彼此認識，共建和諧社會。宗教團體除了弘揚教義之外，也興辦學校、醫院及提供種種福利服務，惠澤社群，實在令人敬佩。

今日我們能在此共賀國慶，我要感謝主辦單位香港宗教界慶祝國慶籌備委員會，匯聚了香港佛教聯合會、天主教香港教區、孔教學院、中華回教博愛社、香港基督教協進會，以及香港道教聯合會的代表，合力籌辦這場國慶大會，讓我們深切體會到香港宗教界的愛國情懷。

展望未來，我深信香港宗教界定會一如以往，與特區政府攜手構建關懷仁愛的社會，為香港的繁榮穩定貢獻更大力量。

最後，我祝今年國慶大會圓滿成功，各團體會務蒸蒸日上，在座各位在濃厚的愛國氛圍中歡度國慶，事事順利、身體健康。多謝大家。"

At the signing ceremony, Ms Chiang acknowledged that the enduring partnership between Customs and CityU encompasses various collaborative initiatives in both academic programmes and specialised training for the Customs Canine Force (CCF). This MOU signing not only marks a significant milestone in the partnership but also launches the Smart Collar Research Project, which aims to study, analyse, as well as optimise the utilisation of data collected from detector dogs including heart rates, respiratory rates and temperatures for enhanced enforcement capabilities and the welfare standards of detector dogs.

CityU, as Hong Kong's pioneer and sole provider of the Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine programme, has been offering invaluable support to Customs through comprehensive breeding training programmes, veterinary nursing expertise, and puppy development courses.

Looking ahead, Customs is dedicated to pursuing innovative collaborations with CityU to enhance the effectiveness of its canine operations. By leveraging academic expertise, Customs aims to implement advanced training techniques and technology, ultimately strengthening the impact of the CCF in safeguarding national security and Hong Kong's boundary.

The CCF has been making significant contributions to Hong Kong since its establishment in 1975. It currently maintains 70 detector dog teams, specialising in narcotics, explosives, currency, firearms, and tobacco detection, supported by more than 100 dedicated officers. To ensure a sustainable supply of high-calibre working dogs, Customs initiated its breeding programme in 2020. The programme has successfully produced 36 puppies to date."
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-11 19:35,2025-09-11 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100758.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 11), twonew imported cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded, involving the same family.

Latest case information

 The two cases involve a 79-year-old female and a 75-year-old male, both living in Sha Tin District. They visited Panyu District in Guangzhou from August 30 to September 6. On September 9, they developed a fever, headache and joint pain. The female patient also developed a rash. They attended General Out-patient Clinics yesterday (September 10) and weresubsequently transferred to Prince of Wales Hospital. They were admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and are now in stable condition. Their blood samples tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing.

They have one household contact, who did not travel to Guangzhou with them. This household contact is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since the two patients stayed in Guangzhou during their incubation periods, the CHP considered that they were infected during travel. The cases were classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the cases to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 16 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  From January to July this year, more than 240 000 cases were recorded in 16 countries/regions worldwide, including about 90 deaths. In Asia, India and Indonesia recorded more than 32 000 and 17 000 cases respectively in 2025. Other regions that have recorded CF cases include the Mainland, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, etc. Although the situation in Guangdong Province has been under control since late August, with only sporadic new cases reported each day, CF outbreaks continue in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

â
The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
立法會：醫務衞生局局長在全體委員會審議階段就《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》各項條文及修正案合併辯論發言（只有中文）,2025-09-11 19:34,2025-09-11 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100735.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（九月十一日）在立法會會議全體委員會審議階段就《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）各項條文及修正案合併辯論的發言：

主席：

我先談談7.8%吸煙率目標的問題，雖然這不是一個《條例草案》答辯環節，但對政府總體政策，特別是加味煙的控制是非常重要的，我們特别留意到年輕人吸食加味煙的問題很嚴重。吸煙的年輕人中，約70%吸第一口煙便是加味煙。如我們不控制加味煙，這數字會上升。7.8%這個數字，是二○一八年以二○一○年的數字作為基數，減低30%來釐訂的。雖然這是於二○一八年釐訂，而不是現屆政府釐訂，但我們都以此作為目標。這目標可比喻作考試訂立滿分為100分，但我們考試從來不會因為未能考獲100分便鬆懈。我相信邵家輝議員和田北辰議員都不會容許子女因為未必能考獲100分，而不讓他們考試。我會盡力，每一分我們都會爭取，目標仍然是向着7.8%這個方向。正如我剛才說，控煙永遠在路上。我們會繼續努力，就算吸煙率達到7.8%，我們仍然可以再降低一些。

就李鎮強議員和邵家輝議員提出的修正案，從政策原則和實際操作角度來看，政府必須堅決反對有關動議，我現在會作詳細回應交代相關理據。

（一）取消或放寬加味煙禁令

首先，李鎮強議員動議在《條例草案》中刪去加味煙禁令相關的條文，與政府整體控煙政策特別是保護下一代、減低煙草產品吸引力的目標背道而馳，漠視加味煙為刺喉有害的煙霧作掩飾，成為糖衣毒藥，增加非吸煙人士，特別是年輕人染上煙癮的機會。調查顯示，越年輕的人士吸食加味煙的比率越高，正如我剛才所說，首次吸煙的年輕人吸食加味煙的比率達到約70%。提出和支持相關議員修正案等同助長煙草商繼續以加味煙吸引年輕人吸第一口煙，向青年人推銷糖衣毒藥，向社會輸出一個極度錯誤的訊息，故此不應予以採納。

反之，禁止加味煙其實是世界衞生組織《煙草控制框架公約》實施準則建議各國推行的措施，是抗衡煙草商以加味劑掩飾煙草產品毒性意圖的重要手段。全球約50個國家和地區，包括歐盟（歐洲聯盟）27個成員國、加拿大和英國已全面禁止售賣加味煙。禁止加味傳統吸煙產品並非香港獨有，反而是讓香港跟上國際控煙政策的舉措。

就邵家輝議員動議在加味煙禁令下原則性豁免任何「通常使用或必需使用的物質」，以及豁免並非為注入味道或香氣而加入的物質等，政府在法案委員會中已一再就禁令的規管框架及其適用範圍進行解說。《條例草案》建議的加味煙禁令以國際最佳實踐典範，即加拿大的監管框架為藍本。《條例草案》訂出「禁止添加劑」的明確標準，首要目標是預防下一代因容易入口、口味多變的加味煙染上煙癮和鼓勵現有煙民戒煙。《條例草案》會以清單形式明文列出禁止和豁免物質，內容和草擬方式均與加拿大相關法規一致。另外，政府亦已一再重申，《條例草案》「指明添加劑」顧名思義並不包括自然存在於煙葉內的成分，執法部門可以透過科學方法區分其是屬於煙草產品中自然存在的物質，或是屬於經人工添加的添加劑，因此我們強調不用修改已能達到議員修正案的效果。

另外，禁令亦已豁免在加拿大、澳洲也有明文列出、屬煙草產品製造過程中必要的物質清單，而過程中我們亦參考了法案委員會的意見作出修訂，豁免的物質及草擬方式，均與加拿大的條文一致，包括以明文方式豁免製造傳統吸煙產品必需的礦物質營養；以及蔬菜萃取物中的澱粉。修訂條文已充分顧及到煙草產品製造的需要，故此邵家輝議員提出的修正案亦無必要。事實上，《條例草案》以國際最佳實踐典範加拿大為藍本。加拿大二○○九年成功實施禁令，超過15年來一樣有合規格的原味煙合法銷售。我們的禁令甚至可以形容為較寬鬆一些，例如薄荷煙會下一階段才禁止，故此我不太同意田北辰議員提出的意見，希望控煙力度可更進取；香港推行時會有過渡安排，及後除非添加了調味劑，傳統煙仍可合法銷售，所謂「禁止加味煙導致全港煙草產品下架」的指控毫無事實依據。

此外，如果將參考加拿大行之有效而且清晰的明文逐項列舉豁免物質草擬方式，修訂為邵家輝議員提出的原則性豁免，模糊定義例如「通常使用的物質」，這是邵家輝議員使用的詞語，到底甚麼是大家「通常使用的物質」？「通常」是一日內、一年內、十年內使用才是「通常」？80%或90%使用量才是「通常」？以及「注入味道或香氣的目的而加入傳統煙的添加劑」。這些如此模糊的定義將為執行禁令帶來極大不確定性，所謂「通常使用的物質」的豁免只會被濫用，而執法部門亦難以判斷煙商添加每項成分的主觀意圖到底是否為了香味而加入物質，或會引發無止境豁免定義的法律訴訟，他們的根本目的是要令禁令難以落實。

（二）以「先審議、後訂立」方式審議附屬法例

另一方面，邵家輝議員動議以「先審議、後訂立」（positive vetting）而非《條例草案》載明的「先訂立、後審議」（negative vetting）方式審議《條例草案》賦權制定的所有附屬法例，包括訂立有關完稅煙標籤制度的生效日期公告；以及制定有關實施全煙害警示包裝規定和證明書制度的規例。

政府不同意邵家輝議員提出的修正案變更有關附屬法例審議方式的主要原因包括：

（1）「先訂立、後審議」是立法會審議附屬法例的常用程序，立法會有既定機制和程序審議政府透過「先訂立、後審議」形式提交的相關附屬法例，讓議員履行監察政府、審議法案的職能，絕對不會削弱議會審議權力；

（2）現行《吸煙（公眾衞生）條例》（第371章）下的規例和命令等附屬法例的制定一向都是訂明以「先訂立、後審議」（negative vetting）的方式推行。《條例草案》為實施全煙害警示包裝的規定和推行禁止加味傳統吸煙產品禁令已經提供了法律框架，包括各項擬議罪行範圍及其最高刑罰等，賦權政府訂立相關附屬法例。事實上，全煙害警示包裝和證明書制度相關的附屬法例旨在體現主體法例的政策原則，範疇不會超過主體法例，附屬法例均主要牽涉執行細則和有關的行政程序。舉例而言，過往規定煙包健康忠告佔包裝的比例和更換健康忠告圖像亦是以「先訂立、後審議」的方式提交立法會審議，性質上與實施全煙害警示包裝規定類同，因此我們認為沿用「先訂立、後審議」的方式是更為合適和合理的做法；

（3）「控煙十招」各項措施的推行時間環環緊扣，包括計劃有序地先推行完稅煙標籤制度、全煙害警示包裝和加味煙禁令，而實施全煙害警示包裝的規定暫計劃於二○二七年第二季與完稅標籤制度同步實施。透過「先訂立、後審議」（negative vetting）方式可讓業界更掌握措施的實際推行時間，為業界生產運作帶來更大確定性。反之，如動議更改第371章一向行之有效的制定附屬法例模式，將會改變條例原有的設計之餘，業界可能因「先審議、後訂立」（positive vetting）難以預計，更要面對冗長的審議過程增加不少不確定性。再者，法案委員會整體上同意各項措施的落實時間表，邵家輝議員提出以「先審議後訂立」審議生效日期公告不符合一貫慣例，實質上亦沒有必要；

（4）政府會在籌備推行上述措施及草擬附屬法例的過程中綜合考慮先導計劃和試行安排的經驗、執法準備、過渡期安排、公眾宣傳進度等操作因素，我希望一再重申，我們會適時就落實措施的安排徵詢相關立法會事務委員會的意見，當中會適當地將議員的意見納入向立法會提交的附屬法例，確保各項控煙措施正式生效前會有足夠長的過渡期讓公眾和業界適應，過程亦絕不會繞過立法會。

有議員提及在程序處理方面、有關環境及生態局的一個例子，我們明確指出，環境及生態局的例子不能直接與是次控煙法例修訂比較：

首先，環境及生態局早於二○二三年十一月向環境事務委員會諮詢時，已明確表示會採用「先審議、後訂立」（positive vetting）程序制訂附屬法例；以及
第二，生產者責任計劃對社會影響面更為廣闊，牽涉不同行業和產品，例如塑膠飲料容器及紙包飲品盒、涉及眾多持份者，包括製造商、進口商、批發商、零售商和消費者共同分擔回收、循環再造、處理和棄置廢棄產品的責任，以及回收設備和數目等議題。反之而言，全煙害警示包裝和證明書制度的附屬法例只是單一類別產品，即煙草產品的技術執行細則和有關的行政程序，亦只牽涉製造商和進口商。


事實上，政府在法案委員會審議過程已全面考慮和吸納議員的意見，我們提出的各項修正案旨在進一步完善《條例草案》，包括理順條文和措施的生效安排，充分體現政府和議員之間的良性互動。

主席，新一階段控煙措施其中一個重點是「禁宣傳、減引誘」，而推行加味煙禁令和實施全煙害警示包裝正正是保護下一代、減低煙草產品吸引力的重要舉措。一個負責任的政府應該迎難而上，全方位杜絕煙草為社會帶來的禍害，因此控煙工作必須堅持到底，在守護下一代健康方面更加沒有妥協的餘地。如《條例草案》今天獲立法會通過，我們定必確保各項措施落實到位，並同時在學校、社區加強宣傳教育工作。我懇請各位議員支持政府的修正案，並反對李鎮強議員和邵家輝議員提出的所有修正案。

我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"
Speech by Acting SJ at Reception of 215th Anniversary of Declaration of Independence of Mexico (English only) (with photos),2025-09-11 19:33,2025-09-11 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100755.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Acting Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, at the Reception of 215th Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence of Mexico today (September 11):

Ambassador Macedo (Consul General of Mexico in Hong Kong, Mr Pablo Macedo Riba), Deputy Commissioner Pan (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Mr Pan Yundong) , ladies and gentlemen,

  Good evening.

  I am delighted to be here with you tonight to celebrate the 215th anniversary of Mexico's independence.

  This historic national day is flush with music and dancing, fireworks, food, parades and family gatherings throughout Mexico. And well beyond.

  It is also a gratifying opportunity to acknowledge the promising ties between our two economies and peoples. Our bilateral merchandise trade last year reached US$5.7 billion, up nearly 13 per cent over 2023, with annual growth a solid 5.4 per cent between 2020 and 2024. Not surprisingly, Mexico last year was Hong Kong's largest trading partner in Latin America.

  And I'm confident that opportunities between us will continue to expand. In January, Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum unveiled ""Plan Mexico"", a long-term strategy to boost the country's economic growth and global competitiveness. It includes emphasising scientific and technological innovation.

  Innovation and technology (I&T) is a Hong Kong Government policy priority. We've got world-class academic and research excellence. As one of the world's leading financial centres, we are blessed with liquidity, along with angel investors, venture capital and private equity funds to support innovative companies.

   Given our strengths as a super connector, Hong Kong is a natural testing ground for new technologies looking for markets in China and throughout the Asian region.

  It also helps, that we are fast integrating with our sister cities in the Greater Bay Area, and its commitment to becoming one of the world's leading I&T centres. The results are clear and compelling.

  The Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster topped the world, for the first time, in the World Intellectual Property Organization's 2025 Global Innovation Index, released this month. And we're just getting going.

  I invite Mexican I&T companies, start-ups and entrepreneurs to collaborate with Hong Kong in shaping the future.

  I look forward, too, to the signing of an agreement on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters with Mexico. It can only create more rewarding opportunities for co-operation.

  We've been blessed with creative collaboration this year, with the Mexican tenor Andrés Moreno García featured in a recent production of The Magic Flute.

  And I know there will be plenty of Mexican creativity on show at ""The Latin Kaleidoscope - Celebrating Latin America in Hong Kong"", later this month at the Hong Kong Observation Wheel and AIA Vitality Park.

  For now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a toast on your proud national day: to the people of Mexico. Cheers."
立法會：醫務衞生局局長在全體委員會審議階段就《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》動議修正案發言（只有中文）,2025-09-11 19:32,2025-09-11 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100721.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（九月十一日）在立法會全體委員會審議階段就《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》動議修正案的發言︰

主席：

我現在提出政府的修正案，修訂《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）。修正案內容已載於先前由立法會秘書處發送予各議員的文件內。修正案主要是因應法案委員會委員的意見而提出。有關修訂大致可歸納為五類，我現作扼要說明。

（一）生效安排

正如我剛才二讀發言時所指，新一階段控煙措施的其中一個重點是防止年青一代吸煙。因應法案委員會內陳凱欣議員的意見，我們建議將有關禁止向18歲以下人士提供另類吸煙產品（另類煙）和傳統吸煙產品的條文的生效日期提前至修訂條例刊憲當日。與之相關的定額罰款條文，亦會相應提早至修訂條例刊憲當日起生效。

此外，感謝簡慧敏議員的意見，我們建議訂明《條例草案》有關賦權醫務衞生局局長制定附屬法例以訂明傳統吸煙產品包裝須符合規定和制定加味煙禁令下的合規證明書制度於修訂條例刊憲當日起生效，從而理順整個執法和立法安排。基於相同考慮，有關賦權衞生署署長透過公告指明診所或健康中心的條文和相關釋義亦建議於修訂條例刊憲當日起生效。以上修訂旨在先賦權制定有關規定和公告，而規定和公告的最終訂立仍需分別另外按既定程序通過和處理。

（二）禁止管有另類煙
 
「指明另類吸煙產品」的定義現時載於《條例草案》的主體條例，法案委員會委員林哲玄議員建議修改相關草擬方式。政府的立法原意是在施行禁止管有另類煙用物質，即所謂「煙彈」的禁令後繼續監察另類煙的使用情況，並會視乎需要考慮進一步規管措施，包括把禁令的涵蓋範圍擴展至所有地方，以及禁止管有另類煙裝置，即俗稱「煙機」。因應林議員的意見，我們建議修訂條文做到下一階段可以將禁令延伸到另類煙裝置，而有關延伸可以在下一階段透過生效日期公告實施，而不用修改主體法例。

此外，為提高執法效能，我們經與相關執法部門討論後，建議為控煙酒督察新增逮捕權力。因應法案委員會的意見，我們建議於《吸煙（公眾衞生）條例》（第371章）及《進出口條例》（第60章）加入新訂的條文，進一步賦予控煙酒督察搜查和使用按理屬必需武力的權力以進行搜查或逮捕，強化控煙酒辦（衞生署控煙酒辦公室）就另類煙禁令的執法效能。

（三）擴大法定禁煙區

除了啟德主場館外，我們建議在「體育場」的定義下加入「啟德青年運動場」，使有關場地的禁煙安排在第371章下與「啟德主場館」一致。

（四）實施禁止加味傳統吸煙產品的禁令
 
政府建議的加味煙禁令以國際最佳實踐典範即加拿大的監管框架為藍本，禁止售賣含有「指明添加劑」的傳統吸煙產品。政府已在法案委員會重申，「指明添加劑」顧名思義並不包括自然存在於煙葉內的成分，禁令亦已豁免在加拿大、澳洲也有明文列出的同一份在煙草產品製造過程中必要的物質清單。因應法案委員會會議上的討論和特別是參考了邵家輝議員和江玉歡議員提出的意見，為提供更清晰的規管框架，我們建議修訂相關附表，使其表述方式與加拿大相關法規一致，包括不以使用目的把「指明添加劑」分類的草擬方法，而是以清單形式列出豁免物質，並考慮到議員的意見，以明文方式述明「指明添加劑」不包括（a）製造傳統吸煙產品必需的礦物質營養；以及（b）蔬菜萃取物中的澱粉。另外，有關「被豁除物質」的列表亦會加入兩項與薄荷味相關的物質，以便在首階段先推行非薄荷加味煙禁令，令條文上更易於操作。

執法方面的安排，為加強執法成效，我們建議在《條例草案》加入新訂的條文，賦權控煙酒督察可為實施加味煙禁令的目的，在任何合理時間進入用作儲存傳統吸煙產品的地方或有該等產品被要約出售的地方，抽取傳統吸煙產品樣本的權力。

為更清晰體現禁令下有關豁免出口及轉口的政策原意和條文的完整性，除了為含有指明添加劑的傳統吸煙產品，以及顯示為含有加味劑的傳統吸煙產品提供有關豁免，我們建議加入新訂的條文，訂明如任何事情是就任何設計在傳統吸煙產品中注入加味劑的產品而作出的，而該產品是由該產品的製造商或入口商持有以供輸出香港的，則該些產品的銷售禁令等規定亦不適用。

（五）延長健康忠告圖像訂明新式樣的過渡期

因應法案委員會的意見特別是邵家輝議員轉達業界的關注，我們建議將《條例草案》有關煙草產品封包或零售盛器上健康忠告圖像訂明新式樣的過渡期，由六個月延長至九個月，讓業界有充足的時間配合及遵守相關規定。

除上述五個範疇，修正案亦涵蓋法案委員會曾討論和考慮的技術性和文本上的修訂，以確保條文表達清晰和前後一致。

法案委員會對上述修正案並無異議，我在此懇請各位議員支持及通過我所動議的修正案。

我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"
立法會：醫務衞生局局長就恢復二讀辯論《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》發言（只有中文）,2025-09-11 19:30,2025-09-11 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100720.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（九月十一日）在立法會會議上就恢復二讀辯論《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》的發言：

主席：

很感謝剛才二讀辯論過程中，多位議員先後發言支持《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》），以推行新一階段控煙措施。

《條例草案》得以今日恢復二讀，是行政立法機關良性互動的體現。由去年六月政府提出「控煙十招」並計劃草擬《條例草案》，我們已經就細節徵詢議員的意見。在提交立法會首讀前，我們已將很多建議納入了《條例草案》。

《條例草案》二讀後，法案委員會召開了共八次會議，我很感謝委員會主席周浩鼎議員和委員在審議過程中，全情投入，進一步提出寶貴意見及很多具體的建議。委員與政府推動控煙的決心是一致的，貫徹我們按循序漸進原則，推出控煙措施的政策方向，全方位抗擊煙禍。而因應民建聯特別是梁熙議員關注到控煙措施的生效日期，政府在審議過程中亦表明，控煙措施會分階段有序推行，敲定措施實施細節及生效日期的時候，會按既定機制徵詢立法會的意見，亦會有過渡期讓公眾和業界適應。我們盡量採納了委員會的建議，充分回應委員的關注，過程中亦一直有緊密交流，在此我特別要感謝所有委員提出的意見，進一步完善《條例草案》，包括在加味煙禁令下禁止和豁免物質逐項明文列出，與加拿大框架一致；提早禁止向18歲以下人士提供傳統或另類煙；延長更新健康忠告圖像過渡期，容許銷售商處理倉存，並同時協助政府釐清市民和業界對個別控煙措施存有的一些誤解，稍後我會在全體委員會審議階段提出修正案的時候詳加介紹。我留意到今日有議員提出修正案。我必須明確指出，有關議員的修正案會嚴重破壞控煙工作，政府在法案委員會階段已經在政策和執行層面上闡述議員修正案對控煙工作造成的影響，稍後我亦會在全體委員會審議階段的時候詳細講解。

主席，煙草產品每年導致超過800萬人死亡，當中大約120萬人因為吸入二手煙而失去生命。每兩名吸煙人士就有一名因為吸煙而提早死亡。這不是一個冰冷的數字，而是無數破碎的家庭的一個現實。

事實上，香港仍然有58萬煙民，煙民長期吸煙會引致各種嚴重的疾病。作為醫務衞生局局長，更曾經作為一名前線醫生，我耳聞目睹過太多本來可避免的慘劇──肺病患者的氣喘聲、中風病人的殘障、心臟病猝逝者親人的哭聲。煙草殘害患者和摯親的身心，很多受煙害的人士往往悔不當初。四十年前的已故國際巨星尤伯連納，以及今年身故的香港政商名人何柱國先生，他們的肺腑之言，觸動人心，令很多人都對逝者哀傷，更令很多人對煙害很憤怒。而二、三手煙更禍及無辜。當煙害瀰漫至我們周邊孩童身邊的時候，我們失去的不只是健康，更是社會的未來。控煙正是對下一代的守護。

吸煙危害健康，而健康就是最大的財富。本地研究數據顯示，於二○二一年因為使用煙草而造成的健康問題估計引致相當於每年約82億港元的經濟損失，放任煙害蔓延，經濟損失勢將擴大。吸煙是最可預防的公共衞生威脅。香港在慢性疾病與人口老化雙重挑戰下，做好控煙工作已經不是一條選擇題，而是一條必答題。

為達致「無煙香港」的願景，政府整體控煙的政策是「立足科學、凝聚共識」。基於實證研究與海外成功經驗，政府在二○二三年提出以四大方面推動新一階段控煙工作，即「管供應、降需求」；「禁宣傳、減引誘」；「擴禁區、免煙害」；及「重教育、助戒煙」，並且展開公眾諮詢，九成市民支持進一步降低吸煙率，社會對「無煙香港」的呼聲成為主流。

政府仔細評估措施成效、操作性與公眾接受度後，在去年六月公布了短、中、長期控煙措施。正如我剛才發言所說，公布措施後我們廣泛聽取各界包括在座不少議員的意見，在提交《條例草案》首讀之前已經納入議員的建議，完善了措施的細節。《條例草案》的多項重要的安排正是在這個行政立法事前協商合作的背景下提出，包括不在條例指明重大措施包括完稅標籤、全煙害警示包裝、加味煙禁令的生效日期，將來按實際情況以「先訂立、後審議」方式另訂生效日期，以保留彈性和容許過渡安排。我們會分階段禁止管有另類煙，首階段容許管有煙機，是因應自由黨邵家輝議員提出的意見作出的調整。另外，為回應不同黨派議員對加味煙禁令和私煙問題的關注，我們將在落實打擊私煙措施後才禁售加味煙等。我理解很多議員都關注私煙執法的工作，政府會立法從針對團夥走私、關口申報、零售層面三方面加強打擊私煙法律框架，有關措施會在修訂條例刊憲後即時生效，以進一步遏止私煙。我們亦聽取了不同議員關於加味煙的意見，將會分階段執行加味煙禁售令，首階段先禁非薄荷煙，以及繼續容許入境市民和遊客攜帶加味煙入境自用。凡此種種顯示，我們向立法會提交的《條例草案》已經是一套已經廣泛吸納立法會和社會多方意見「控煙大合唱」，男女聲、高低音協調合作，成為一首推動「無煙香港」之歌。

法案委員會亦曾邀請社會各界就《條例草案》提交意見書，在法案委員會委員討論過程，以及議員剛才的發言當中，部分議員和個別團體憂慮加強控煙措施會影響經濟和旅遊業。事實上，控煙工作和經濟從來不是零和遊戲。我再三強調，控煙可以「贏健康」，而不一定會「輸經濟」。在立法會早前接獲的意見書當中，超過30份來自多個商業和專業界別的團體和人士支持，足以反映控煙和經濟並無衝突。有餐飲業的意見更指出，二○○七年時業界亦曾因擔心擴大禁煙區會導致生意大幅下滑，不過正式推出後，食肆生意不跌反升，證明「無煙餐廳」是真正具有吸引力的賣點，不少餐廳更以「無煙」作為宣傳亮點，成功吸引食客。我們同意有關觀點，相關經驗亦表明加強控煙不會打擊經濟。真正國際都會的魅力，在於清新空氣賦予市民的幸福感，在彰顯城市品質。再者，控煙是全球大勢。從提倡室內禁煙到加味煙禁令，世界各地控煙進程不斷深化。「控煙十招」不存在政府「去得好盡」，亦未有要求要「贏到最盡」，事實是香港要「追落後」。政府想「大家贏」。

另外，因應法案委員會就執行方面所提出的意見，衞生署會就新增罪行制定實施指引和部門間的協作和聯絡機制，確保日後執法流程上更加暢順，亦會在措施實施前向公眾加強解說，更會與旅遊業界保持緊密聯繫，透過不同渠道向旅客加強宣傳和推廣有關措施。

主席，如果《條例草案》得到立法會通過，將能為新一階段控煙措施提供法律基礎。首要重點是打擊私煙，確保其他控煙措施能夠發揮最大成效，以及防止新世代吸煙。加強打擊私煙的措施，以及禁止向18歲以下人士提供傳統或另類煙的規定，將會在修訂條例刊憲後即時生效。二手煙危害公眾健康，新一階段控煙措施將會增設禁煙區保護「老、幼、病、弱」，違反吸煙條例的定額罰款額亦會提高至3,000元，新增禁煙區和新的定額罰款額將於二○二六年一月一日生效。另類煙禁令實施超過三年，不少人士仍然接觸到另類煙，特別是電子煙，甚至以電子煙吸食含有依托咪酯的毒煙彈，為從根本打擊使用另類煙，二○二六年四月三十日起，我們會禁止在公眾地方管有另類煙用物質。為了「管供應」以及「禁宣傳」，我們會在二○二五年第三季推出完稅標籤制度先導計劃，目標於二○二七年第二季與全煙害警示包裝同步實施。加味煙是煙草商吸引新世代吸煙的伎倆，是毒藥包上糖衣，我們會在完稅標籤制度全面實施後，實施加味傳統煙的禁令。

除了《條例草案》建議的各項立法措施，我在此要指出，推動戒煙亦是控煙策略的重要一環，政府在推動戒煙和宣傳教育方面的工作從來沒有停下，包括近年增加戒煙服務的種類、服務點，以及服務名額，以及透過與教育界合作，提高學生對吸煙禍害的認識，營造無煙的氣氛。陳凱欣議員和郭玲麗議員特別關心學生及戒煙工作。我們會繼續深化戒煙工作，包括探討如何進一步善用地區康健中心和家庭醫生網絡，便利戒煙者尋找最適合和便捷的戒煙方法，以及加強對學生的宣傳教育工作。

主席，正如我在動議二讀《條例草案》的時候提到，控煙工作就如逆水行舟，不進則退，需要全社會多代人的持續和共同努力。控煙永遠在路上，從來沒有最後一哩路，但今日我們可以共同為控煙之路奠下重要的里程碑。我懇請議員以下一代福祉為念，回應社會期盼，支持和通過這條凝聚多方共識的《條例草案》和稍後動議的修正案。

我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"

The delegation also visited the drug regulatory authority in Beijing to deepen exchanges and co-operation.

Representatives from the DH and the Hospital Authority today jointly met with the Party Committee Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission (BJHC), Mr Zhong Dongbo, for the annual bilateral exchange on health between Hong Kong and Beijing. The DH and the BJHC exchanged views and shared experiences on the prevention and control of communicable diseases. Topics included using artificial intelligence to assist in communicable disease surveillance, responding to mosquito-borne diseases (including dengue and chikungunya fever), and promoting vaccination among the members of the public, especially adults. They also shared experiences in training professional talent, the development of traditional Chinese medicine and regulatory matters.

""The DH renewed its five-year co-operation agreement in the field of public health with the BJHC yesterday (September 10). Today, both sides had in-depth discussions on the details for implementing the agreement, which will lay a solid foundation for steadfast and long-term co-operation in the future. The agreement will help further refine the public health systems of Beijing and Hong Kong, and strengthen our capabilities in controlling communicable diseases in order to collaboratively respond to public health emergencies, particularly in the integrated emergency responses to major respiratory infectious diseases,"" Dr Lam said.

Following the meeting, the DH delegation visited the Beijing Municipal Medical Products Administration (BMPA) and exchanged views with the Party Committee Secretary of the BMPA Leading Party Committee, Mr Sun Liguang, and Director of BMPA, Ms Cao Wei, on advancing the development of the drug regulatory regime and aligning with international standards.

The DH is actively preparing to establish the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation (CMPR) next year and will implement 'primary evaluation' for new drug registration in phases starting next year. The establishment of the CMPR will significantly promote medical innovation in Hong Kong. It will not only help innovative drugs and medical products on the Mainland enter international markets, but also attract overseas enterprises to invest in scientific and technological research and development in Hong Kong. This will enable both Hong Kong and global citizens to access high-quality innovative drugs and medical devices earlier and faster, highlighting the HKSAR's role as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder',"" Dr Lam said.

The DH delegation will continue its visit to public health-related authorities in Beijing tomorrow (September 12)."

海關人員七月十五日在香港國際機場截查一名四十八歲的抵港男旅客，並在他攜帶的個人行李內檢獲約二萬零六百支未完稅香煙，估計市值約九萬二千七百元，應課稅值約六萬八千一百。該名旅客隨即被捕。他今日被判處監禁五個月和罰款二千元。

  Customs officers intercepted an incoming male passenger, aged 48, at Hong Kong International Airport on July 15. About 20 600 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes were seized from his personal baggage. The estimated market value was about $92,700, and the duty potential was about $68,100. He was subsequently arrested and was sentenced to five months' imprisonment and fined $2,000 today.

  In addition, Customs officers intercepted an incoming male passengers, aged 31, at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (September 10). About 90 400 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes were seized from his personal baggage. The estimated market value was about $370,600, and the duty potential was about $298,800. He was subsequently arrested and was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment and fined $1,500 today.

  Customs welcomes the sentences. The custodial sentences have imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflect the seriousness of the offences.

  Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-09-11 18:35,2025-09-11 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100698.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（九月十一日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱的輸入個案，涉及同一個家庭。

最新個案資料

兩名病人分別為79歲女子和75歲男子，住所位於沙田區。他們於八月三十日至九月六日到訪廣州市番禺區，九月九日開始出現發燒、頭痛和關節痛，女病人亦出現皮疹。他們昨日（九月十日）前往普通科門診診所求醫，兩人其後均被轉送到威爾斯親王醫院，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他們的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。

他們有一名家居接觸者，並沒有同行到廣州市，現時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於上述兩名病人於潛伏期身處廣州市，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，均屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得16宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

今年一月至七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗病例，當中約90宗為死亡個案。亞洲方面，二○二五年印度及印度尼西亞分別錄得超過32 000宗及17 000宗病例，其他錄得病例的地區包括內地、孟加拉國及斯里蘭卡等。雖然廣東省基孔肯雅熱的情況在八月下旬起已受到控制，每日只有零星新增個案，但現時全球多國仍爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
