S for Housing continues Portugal visit to promote development opportunities in GBA (with photos),2025-07-04 13:11,2025-07-04 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400249.htm,"âThe Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, continued her visit to Lisbon, Portugal, yesterday (July 3, Lisbon time).

Ms Ho attended a business luncheon co-organised by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Development Office under the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau and the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Brussels to promote the vast opportunities for Portuguese companies arising from the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and how Hong Kong can play its important roles as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" between the two places with its unique advantages of having the strong support of the motherland while maintaining unparalleled connectivity with the world. Around 130 participants attended the luncheon, with representatives from over 80 Portuguese enterprises from the construction sector, information technology sector, commercial sector and professional organisations, as well as representatives from 17 relevant Hong Kong enterprises.

During the luncheon, Ms Ho highlighted that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has been actively promoting the use of innovative construction technologies to enhance the speed, quantity, quality and efficiency in increasing the supply of affordable housing. Under the Housing•I&T initiative this year, the Housing Bureau (HB) will organise a series of activities to foster exchanges between Hong Kong and other countries and regions in areas such as smart construction, smart estate management, energy saving and green buildings. She encouraged Portuguese enterprises to seize these opportunities and strengthen collaborations with the Mainland and Hong Kong.

Ms Ho expressed her gratitude in particular to the trade representatives from Hong Kong, including those participating in the construction of public housing, Light Public Housing (LPH) and transitional housing, for attending the luncheon in Lisbon and taking the opportunity to share in person with the participants Hong Kong's opportunities and advantages in connecting the Mainland and the world. By complying with international standards, stipulating local regulations and harnessing the strengths of the GBA in smart construction, Hong Kong can further advance in its development of Modular Integrated Construction (MiC), the transfer of on-site construction processes to factories and the application of construction robotics. With the expeditious building ofLPH and transitional housing, the living conditions and quality of life of people living in inadequate housing can be improved as soon as practicable. The significant housing production target of 308 000 public housing units over the next 10 years also enables the HB and the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) to promote the adoption of innovative technologies and advance public housing developments in a new era of smart construction.

Earlier in the day, Ms Ho visited EntreCampos, a local redevelopment project jointly developed by the public and private sectors, comprising social housing for middle-class residents, offices, retail, community facilities and green spaces. The project adopted Building Information Modelling (BIM) during construction. She also visited the new headquarters of an insurance company in the project. The building employs smart technologies and innovative sustainable energy systems to enhance energy efficiency. Ms Ho stated that the HKHA has strived to promote greener and more energy-efficient designs, aiming to attain a ""gold"" rating or above under BEAM Plus for all new housing developments. The measures include adopting MiC in construction with modules manufactured accurately and effectively in factories, and other innovative technologies such as BIM to facilitate planning throughout the construction process and enhance management, which can save energy, reduce waste and make the construction process more environmentally friendly. To improve energy efficiency, the HKHA has also implemented various green initiatives such as smart lighting control systems, light emitting diode lighting and solar photovoltaic systems. In estate management, the application of the Internet of Things and AI for collecting and analysing data has also enhanced estate management quality and efficiency. She said she looked forward to continued exchanges between Hong Kong and Portugal on innovative construction technologies and green building designs.

Ms Ho has arrived in Barcelona, Spain, last night and will begin her visit there today (July 4, Barcelona time)."
房屋局局長繼續葡萄牙訪問行程推廣粵港澳大灣區發展機遇（附圖）,2025-07-04 13:10,2025-07-04 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400248.htm,"​房屋局局長何永賢昨日（里斯本時間七月三日）繼續在葡萄牙里斯本的訪問行程。

何永賢出席由政制及內地事務局粵港澳大灣區發展辦公室與香港駐布魯塞爾經濟貿易辦事處合辦的商務午餐會，推廣粵港澳大灣區發展為葡萄牙企業帶來的龐大機遇，以及香港如何利用背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，發揮其作為兩地之間「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的重要功能。午餐會約130位人士出席，當中包括來自近80間葡萄牙建築業界、資訊科技業界、商界企業及專業團體的代表，以及17間香港相關業界代表。

何永賢在午餐會上指，香港特區政府一直大力推動應用創新建築科技以提速、提量、提質、提效增加可負擔房屋的供應。今年房屋局更以「共築．智能」為主題，透過一系列活動，促進香港與各地就智能建造、智慧屋邨管理、節能綠建等範疇的交流發展。她鼓勵葡萄牙企業抓緊機遇，加強與內地和香港的合作連繫。

她又特意感謝來自香港的業界代表來到里斯本出席午餐會，當中包括參與興建公營房屋、「簡約公屋」及過渡性房屋的業界朋友，把握這個機會親自向與會嘉賓分享香港盡享「內聯外通」的機會和優勢，既接通國際標準，善用香港規範，亦借力灣區「智造」，讓香港不論在「組裝合成」建築法（MiC）、建屋「工廠化」、建築機械人的應用等，都能更進一步發展。透過快速興建「簡約公屋」及過渡性房屋，盡快改善居住於不適切居所市民的居住環境。同時，未來十年興建308 000個公營房屋單位的龐大的建屋量，也成為為房屋局和香港房屋委員會（房委會）促進創新技術落地的好機會，帶領公營房屋發展邁進智能建造新紀元。

此外，何永賢早上參觀當地一個由公私營合作發展，包含以中產住戶為對象的社會房屋、辦公室、零售、社區設施和綠化空間的重建項目EntreCampos，項目興建過程中採用建築信息模擬技術（BIM）。她亦參觀了項目內一間保險公司的新總部大樓，該大樓利用智能科技、創新的可持續能源系統提高能源效益。何永賢指，房委會一直致力於推動更環保、更節能的設計，所有新項目均以「綠建環評」的「金級」或以上評級為目標，措施包括在建築過程中運用MiC，在廠房更精準、高效地生產組件；利用BIM等創新科技協助施工規劃及優化管理，從而節能減廢，令工程更環保。為提升能源效益，房委會亦實施多項綠色措施，例如智慧照明控制系統、發光二極管（LED）照明和太陽能光伏系統等。屋邨管理方面，利用物聯網和人工智能來收集和分析不同數據，也為屋邨管理提質、提效。她期望兩地未來繼續就創新建屋技術、綠色建築設計等緊密交流。

何永賢昨晚已轉抵西班牙巴塞羅那，今日（巴塞羅那時間七月四日）展開在當地的訪問行程。"

政務司副司長出席習主席回信培僑中學高一學生兩周年及培僑中學喜迎國旗儀式活動致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-07-04 12:34,2025-07-04 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400310.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（七月四日）出席習主席回信培僑中學高一學生兩周年、培僑中學喜迎北京天安門廣場升起的五星紅旗及紀念中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年活動的致辭：

尊敬的陳楓副署長（國安公署副署長）、潘雲東副特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署副特派員）、王偉明部長 （中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室教育科技部部長）、曾鈺成校監（培僑中學校監）、伍煥杰校長（培僑中學校長）、黎旨軒專員（東區民政事務專員）、各位嘉賓、各位老師、各位同學（包括從蘇州來的老師和同學）：

大家好！今天很高興出席習主席回信培僑中學高一學生兩周年及培僑中學喜迎國旗儀式活動，與大家分享獲贈國家這份珍貴禮物的莫大喜悅和興奮。

今年是抗戰勝利80周年，也是世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年，意義重大。國旗正是國家主權和尊嚴的象徵。為促進國民教育及培養學生的國家觀念和民族感情，以及加強學生對國民身分的認同，現時中小學在每個上課日升掛國旗；每周舉行一次升國旗儀式；並在重要的日子－－例如香港特別行政區成立紀念日和國慶日－－及特別場合舉行升國旗儀式。不少學校亦組織升旗隊，並在升國旗儀式後安排「國旗下講話」，由教師和同學探索國家新近發展、中華文化、中國歷史等題目，持續深化同學的國家觀念和文化自信，弘揚愛國主義精神，落實愛國主義教育。

按《中華人民共和國國旗法》的規定，國旗的通用尺度有五種，最大的一種長2.88米、高1.92米；而天安門廣場上升掛的國旗則是個特例，長5米、寬3.3米，是全國升掛的國旗中最大的。為傳承紅色基因，部分使用過和具有特殊歷史節點的天安門國旗，會贈送給政府機關、學校等。剛剛伍校長的分享中提到，北京市人民政府天安門地區管理委員會在今年七月一日向培僑中學贈送國旗，這面國旗曾於二○二三年七月二十四日在天安門廣場升起，正正是國家主席習近平回信培僑中學同學的大日子！國家的這個心意和心思，充分彰顯了國家對培僑中學以至香港年輕一代的關懷和勉勵。我相信，培僑中學的老師及學生們必定深深感受到祖國的厚愛。

習主席回信中特別提及，「愛國主義是中華民族精神的核心，廣大香港同胞素有愛國愛港光榮傳統，這是『一國兩制』行穩致遠的重要基礎。」習主席回信兩周年在即，我勉勵同學們要好好牢記當中的精神和指導，繼續深入了解祖國悠久的歷史、優秀的文化和現實國情，鞏固對國家和中華文化的認識和認同，同時亦要深刻認識世界發展大勢。作為香港未來的主人翁，同學們要把握香港「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的獨特優勢，好好裝備自己，貢獻國家、貢獻香港。

培僑中學接過從北京天安門來的國旗，意義重大：這猶如奧運會的運動員傳遞火炬，可以把愛國精神傳承並宣揚到香港其他的學校，讓更多同學們在國旗下茁壯成長，為民族復興、建設香港付出青春的力量！謝謝大家。"

Selection completed for fourth cohort of School Nominations Direct Admission Scheme,2025-07-04 11:00,2025-07-04 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400198.htm,"âThe Education Bureau (EDB) today (July 4) announced the completion of the selection process for the fourth cohort of the School Nominations Direct Admission Scheme (SNDAS).
  
A total of 814 valid SNDAS nominations were received from 420 secondary schools for the fourth cohort. In the past few months, the eight University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities participating in the Scheme arranged interviews for the nominated students and carefully considered their individual merits. Firm offers were eventually made to 342 nominees prior to the release of the 2025 Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Examination results, of which 335 have accepted the offers and will commence study on their chosen UGC-funded undergraduate programmes in September 2025 in a wide spectrum of disciplines including architecture, surveying and town planning, arts and humanities, business, computing and engineering, environmental studies, design, fine arts, language, law, medicine and health, music, sciences and social sciences. A breakdown by study discipline is provided in the Annex.
  
The Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, was pleased to note the encouraging results of the fourth cohort of the SNDAS, in particular the continuing increase in the number of offers made to successful nominees.
  
  ""Talent in diversified skills and knowledge is the key to Hong Kong's future development. The Government has always placed great emphasis on nurturing young people, striving to enhance the education system and creating diverse opportunities for students to reach their full potential in different areas. I am deeply grateful for the support from secondary schools and universities for the SNDAS, as well as their recognition of students' multifaceted talents, and for cultivating more future talent for Hong Kong,"" Dr Choi said.

To promote a culture of multifaceted excellence, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau has launched the Multi-talent Development Scholarship (MDS) in the 2025/26 academic year, funded by the Board of Management of the Chinese Permanent Cemeteries, for admittees of the SNDAS demonstrating outstanding achievements in arts, sports and/or community service on top of the firm offers made under the SNDAS.

Among the students being formally admitted to their respective universities under the SNDAS, each of the eight UGC-funded universities will be invited to nominate SNDAS admittees demonstrating an outstanding performance in arts, sports and/or community service for awarding scholarships in addition to the firm offers made. The quotas of scholarship nominations will be distributed proportionally having regard to the number of students admitted to each university by the SNDAS. Each awardee, not subject to means testing, will be granted a scholarship of $10,000 per year across his/her four-year tuition period. Universities shall enjoy the autonomy to select and nominate awardees for the MDS.

The fifth cohort of the SNDAS will be open for applications by Secondary Six students taking the 2026 HKDSE Examinations and commencing their undergraduate studies in September 2026. Details of the application arrangements will be announced in due course.
  
The SNDAS was introduced in 2021 as part of EDB's response to the recommendations made by the Task Force on Review of School Curriculum, which included enhancing flexibility in university admissions. The eight UGC-funded universities had designated around 300 publicly funded undergraduate programmes for the fourth cohort of the SNDAS and set admission criteria that are not based on HKDSE Examination results for individual programmes."

Commissioner Cui Jianchun (Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Professor Teresa Cheng (Co-Chairman of the Asian Academy of International Law), Dr Anthony Neoh (Co-Chairman of the Asian Academy of International Law), consuls-general, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. And welcome to Hong Kong. Welcome to the 2025 Colloquium on International Law.

  Gathered here today, are some 200 legal professionals and government and institutional leaders – from Hong Kong, the Mainland and some 40 jurisdictions in Asia and around the world.

  I would also like to extend a special welcome to His Excellency Dr Kamalinne Pinitpuvadol, Secretary-General of the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization, here with more than 30 delegates from the international organisation. Also, a special thanks to Mr Miguel de Serpa Soares, former Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs and United Nations Legal Counsel.

  This year's Colloquium spotlights two key themes: the United Nations' 80th anniversary, and LawTech, AI (artificial intelligence) and the future of the international order. I was told that we have simultaneous interpretation by AI on the screen. All in the aspiration of bridging innovation and governance.

  The establishment of the United Nations, in 1945, marked a new chapter in multilateralism, creating an international organisation responsible for collective action on global issues, with the goal of fostering peace, security and development.

  China, our country, is a founding member of the UN (United Nations) and one of the UN Security Council's five permanent members. China actively participates in the UN, playing a significant role in shaping international law and responses to global issues.

  Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong enjoys unparalleled access to both the Mainland and the world. Hong Kong participates in various commissions and groups under the UN, as members of Chinese delegations, in accordance with the Basic Law.

  In the eight decades since the UN's establishment, technology has transformed our world. Its endless reshaping of societies, and peoples, is also a UN priority. And that very much includes artificial intelligence, a fast-growing area in innovation and technology.

  From trading floors and hospital wards, to schools and law courts, AI now permeates every sector – not as a distant future, but as today's operational heartbeat. Hong Kong, dedicated to developing into an international I&T (innovation and technology) centre, recognises this tidal shift. Mastering AI is no longer a competitive edge. It is the existential infrastructure for every industry and sector.

  Last September, a UN Secretary-General's High-level Advisory Body on AI published the report ""Governing AI for Humanity"". It highlighted the need to boost global co-operation, noting that only an ""inclusive and comprehensive approach to AI governance"" can address the ""multifaceted and evolving challenges and opportunities AI presents on a global scale"".

  Hong Kong is strategically positioned to promote international collaboration in advancing AI.

  Under ""one country, two systems"", we have long been a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", bringing together China and the rest of the world. And providing key value-adding professional services along the way.

  The HKSAR Government actively promotes LawTech, including online dispute resolution and the use of AI.

  Our Department of Justice has established a Consultation Group on LawTech Development, which dedicates its efforts to developing LawTech strategies for the legal and dispute resolution sector.

  Last month, we held our first LexGoTech Roundtable, to advance the sector's understanding of LawTech and its applications, with focused discussions on the opportunities and challenges of LawTech and AI.

  As for online dispute resolution, Hong Kong is one of seven economies, alongside such places as Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and the United States, to follow APEC's (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) Collaborative Framework for Online Dispute Resolution of Cross-Border Business-to-Business Disputes. The Framework was designed to help businesses resolve disputes online through negotiation, mediation and arbitration.

  We have also been collaborating with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, establishing a Hong Kong-based Project Office for collaboration with the Commission in 2020. The Project Office provides important support to the Inclusive Global Legal Innovation Platform on Online Dispute Resolution, which converges international efforts, across different jurisdictions, to advance this form of dispute resolution. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a salient example of our dedication to international collaboration, and the development of technology for legal services.

  The HKSAR Government fully supports the work of the United Nations, especially in promoting the peaceful settlement of international disputes.

  Just over a month ago, the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation was signed here in Hong Kong, I'm pleased to say.

  The International Organization for Mediation, or IOMed, will become the world's first inter-governmental, international organisation dedicated to resolving international disputes through mediation, a peaceful means to maintain international peace and security, as stipulated in the Charter of the UN.

  I am grateful to the Central Government for its support of Hong Kong, as well as the trust from other signing states, for giving us the honour of serving as the IOMed's headquarters. It will be based in the former Wan Chai Police Station, a historic architecture that has long been part and parcel of Hong Kong's law and order, and I am hopeful it will open by the end of the year.

  The IOMed's mandate is clear and compelling: to resolve international disputes based on mutual respect and understanding. And it will be available to all countries, regardless of their culture, language or legal system.

  That, ladies and gentlemen, will certainly improve global governance. And promote world peace and stability.

  My thanks to the Asian Academy of International Law and its Foundation, as well as the Chinese Society of International Law, for once again organising this seminal international law event, for bringing prominent international legal professionals and speakers to Hong Kong to discuss the latest issues, concerns and promising developments in law.

  And while you're here, make good time to discover what the world city of Hong Kong has to offer – in arts, culture and entertainment, on our islands and coastal areas, our Michelin-starred restaurants, dim sum parlours, pubs, diners and cafes – all of them brimful of the best of East and West. Enjoy it all.

  I wish you all a rewarding Colloquium, and the best of legal business, and mediation, in the year to come.

  Thank you."

  The establishment of the United Nations, in 1945, marked a new chapter in multilateralism, creating an international organisation responsible for collective action on global issues, with the goal of fostering peace, security and development.

  China, our country, is a founding member of the UN (United Nations) and one of the UN Security Council's five permanent members. China actively participates in the UN, playing a significant role in shaping international law and responses to global issues.

  Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong enjoys unparalleled access to both the Mainland and the world. Hong Kong participates in various commissions and groups under the UN, as members of Chinese delegations, in accordance with the Basic Law.

  In the eight decades since the UN's establishment, technology has transformed our world. Its endless reshaping of societies, and peoples, is also a UN priority. And that very much includes artificial intelligence, a fast-growing area in innovation and technology.

  From trading floors and hospital wards, to schools and law courts, AI now permeates every sector – not as a distant future, but as today's operational heartbeat. Hong Kong, dedicated to developing into an international I&T (innovation and technology) centre, recognises this tidal shift. Mastering AI is no longer a competitive edge. It is the existential infrastructure for every industry and sector.

  Last September, a UN Secretary-General's High-level Advisory Body on AI published the report ""Governing AI for Humanity"". It highlighted the need to boost global co-operation, noting that only an ""inclusive and comprehensive approach to AI governance"" can address the ""multifaceted and evolving challenges and opportunities AI presents on a global scale"".

  Hong Kong is strategically positioned to promote international collaboration in advancing AI.

  Under ""one country, two systems"", we have long been a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", bringing together China and the rest of the world. And providing key value-adding professional services along the way.

  The HKSAR Government actively promotes LawTech, including online dispute resolution and the use of AI.

  Our Department of Justice has established a Consultation Group on LawTech Development, which dedicates its efforts to developing LawTech strategies for the legal and dispute resolution sector.

  Last month, we held our first LexGoTech Roundtable, to advance the sector's understanding of LawTech and its applications, with focused discussions on the opportunities and challenges of LawTech and AI.

  As for online dispute resolution, Hong Kong is one of seven economies, alongside such places as Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and the United States, to follow APEC's (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) Collaborative Framework for Online Dispute Resolution of Cross-Border Business-to-Business Disputes. The Framework was designed to help businesses resolve disputes online through negotiation, mediation and arbitration.

  We have also been collaborating with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, establishing a Hong Kong-based Project Office for collaboration with the Commission in 2020. The Project Office provides important support to the Inclusive Global Legal Innovation Platform on Online Dispute Resolution, which converges international efforts, across different jurisdictions, to advance this form of dispute resolution. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a salient example of our dedication to international collaboration, and the development of technology for legal services.

  The HKSAR Government fully supports the work of the United Nations, especially in promoting the peaceful settlement of international disputes.

  Just over a month ago, the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation was signed here in Hong Kong, I'm pleased to say.

  The International Organization for Mediation, or IOMed, will become the world's first inter-governmental, international organisation dedicated to resolving international disputes through mediation, a peaceful means to maintain international peace and security, as stipulated in the Charter of the UN.

  I am grateful to the Central Government for its support of Hong Kong, as well as the trust from other signing states, for giving us the honour of serving as the IOMed's headquarters. It will be based in the former Wan Chai Police Station, a historic architecture that has long been part and parcel of Hong Kong's law and order, and I am hopeful it will open by the end of the year.

  The IOMed's mandate is clear and compelling: to resolve international disputes based on mutual respect and understanding. And it will be available to all countries, regardless of their culture, language or legal system.

  That, ladies and gentlemen, will certainly improve global governance. And promote world peace and stability.

  My thanks to the Asian Academy of International Law and its Foundation, as well as the Chinese Society of International Law, for once again organising this seminal international law event, for bringing prominent international legal professionals and speakers to Hong Kong to discuss the latest issues, concerns and promising developments in law.

  And while you're here, make good time to discover what the world city of Hong Kong has to offer – in arts, culture and entertainment, on our islands and coastal areas, our Michelin-starred restaurants, dim sum parlours, pubs, diners and cafes – all of them brimful of the best of East and West. Enjoy it all.

  I wish you all a rewarding Colloquium, and the best of legal business, and mediation, in the year to come.

  Thank you."
Nomination for 2025 Election Committee Subsector By-elections to begin on July 22,2025-07-04 10:00,2025-07-04 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070300758.htm,"The nomination period for the 2025 Election Committee Subsector (ECSS) By-elections will run from July 22 (Tuesday) until August 4 (Monday).

 The By-elections will fill a total of 93 vacancies in the membership of the Election Committee (EC) to be returned by election involving 28 subsectors, while another 10 vacancies involving five subsectors to be returned by nomination will be filled through supplementary nominations by designated bodies (see Annex for details). The Registration and Electoral Office (REO) issued relevant gazette notices and uploaded relevant information to the election website (www.elections.gov.hk) for the By-elections today (July 4). If the number of validly nominated candidates for a subsector exceeds the number of EC members to be elected for that subsector at the By-elections, a poll for that subsector will be held on September 7.

 A spokesman for the REO said, ""A person nominated as a candidate (a nominated person) must be a registered geographical constituency elector aged 18 or above, who is a registered voter for the relevant subsector or has a substantial connection with that subsector. Details on the eligibility and disqualification in regard to nomination as a candidate and being elected as an EC member, and the requirements to be complied with by persons nominated as candidates, are set out in sections 17, 17A, 18, 18A, 19 and 20 of the Schedule to the Chief Executive Election Ordinance (Cap. 569).

 ""The nomination form for the By-elections must be subscribed by no fewer than five voters registered for the subsector concerned. Each voter may subscribe multiple nominations regarding a particular subsector but the number of candidates that each voter can nominate should not exceed the number of EC members to be elected by that subsector at the By-elections. In the case of a corporate voter, the subscription of the nomination form may only be effected by the corporate voter's authorised representative,"" the spokesman said.

 The Electoral Affairs Commission has appointed Returning Officers for relevant subsectors to receive nomination forms for their respective subsectors and to handle other electoral matters. The notice for the appointment of Returning Officers, with their office addresses, was also gazetted today and uploaded to the election website.

 The nomination forms may be obtained during ordinary business hours from 9am to 5pm on Mondays to Fridays and from 9am to noon on Saturdays (except public holidays) beginning today at the two offices of the REO (8/F, Treasury Building, 3 Tonkin Street West, Cheung Sha Wan, Kowloon, and Unit 2301-03, 23/F, Millennium City 6, 392 Kwun Tong Road, Kwun Tong, Kowloon), the offices of the Returning Officers of the relevant subsectors or any of the District Offices. The forms can also be downloaded from the election website.

 A nominated person must submit the completed nomination form and an election deposit of $1,000 in person to the respective Returning Officers during the abovementioned ordinary business hours (except public holidays) within the nomination period. The spokesman reminded those nominated persons that they may consider lodging the election deposit by Faster Payment System (FPS), which is newly introduced this year, or by cash and cashier orders as far as possible, to avoid any complications arising from a cheque not being honoured.

 ""The nominated persons are advised to submit their nomination forms as early as possible to allow time to correct mistakes, if any, in the forms before the nomination deadline,"" the spokesman said.

  Separately, the nominated persons must, in accordance with the requirements by the Candidate Eligibility Review Committee (CERC), complete and return the Eligibility Review Supplementary Information Form (SIF). The SIF is distributed together with the nomination forms and can be downloaded from the election website. The nominated persons shall put the completed SIF in a separate and sealed envelope and hand it in person together with the nomination form to the office of the Returning Officer within the nomination period for onward transmission to the CERC Secretariat. The nominated persons can also submit the completed SIF to the CERC Secretariat direct as soon as possible but no later than 5pm on August 4 through any of the following means:


email tocerc_secretariat@cerc.gov.hk;
fax to 2505 0673; or
return to the drop-in box of the CERC Secretariat at the entrance on 2/F, East Wing, Central Government Offices, 2 Tim Mei Avenue, Tamar, Hong Kong.


 Copies of the nomination forms of respective subsectors are available for public inspection at the offices of the Returning Officers during ordinary business hours after the start of the nomination period. Members of the public may also inspect copies of all the nomination forms at the REO office in Kwun Tong.

 For enquiries, please call the election hotline at 2891 1001."

""The public should carry and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration while engaging in outdoor activities,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

""Those engaged in strenuous outdoor activities should avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcohol, as they speed up water loss through the urinary system,"" the spokesman explained.

""Infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and individuals who are overweight are more vulnerable to heat stroke. They should pay special attention,"" the spokesman added.

The public should adopt the following precautions:


Wear loose and light-coloured clothing to reduce heat absorption and facilitate sweat evaporation and heat dissipation;
Avoid vigorous exercise and prolonged activities like hiking or trekking as heat, sweating and exhaustion can place additional demands on the physique;
Perform outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible;
For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;
Apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen product with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply every two hours if you need to stay outdoors for a prolonged period, or after swimming, sweating or towelling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear long-sleeved and loose-fitting clothes; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.

發言人說：「李斯特菌可在一般烹煮溫度下輕易消滅，但能在冷藏低溫下生存和繁殖。大部分身體健康的人在感染這種細菌後不會出現病徵或只出現輕微病徵如發燒、肌肉疼痛、頭痛、噁心、嘔吐及腹瀉等。但對初生嬰兒、長者和免疫力較低的人，則可能出現嚴重的併發症如敗血症及腦膜炎，甚至死亡。孕婦感染李斯特菌一般症狀輕微，但可導致胎兒流產、夭折、早產，或引致新生嬰兒患上嚴重的感染。」

「為減低感染李斯特菌病的風險，高危人士如孕婦應盡量進食剛煮好的熱食，徹底翻熱冷凍食物，並避免進食或在進食前徹底煮熟高風險食物（即食食物例如凍食肉類、冷燻的海產、軟芝士、沙律等），即使有關食物只屬於一道菜色的一部分。」

CFS urges public not to consume kinds of imported turkey bacon suspected to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes,2025-07-03 23:22,2025-07-04 06:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/03/P2025070300989.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (July 3) urged the public not to consume kinds of prepackaged turkey bacon originated from the United States (US) due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes, a pathogen. The trade should stop using or selling the affected batches of the product immediately if they possess any of them.

Products details are as follows:

Product name: Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original
Place of origin: US
Pack size (Universal Product Code/Lot number) and use-by dates:
(1) 12oz (071871548601/RS40), July 18 to August 2, 2025;
(2) 36oz (071871548748/RS19, RS40 and RS42), July 23 to September 4, 2025; and
(3) 48oz (071871548793/RS19, RS40 and RS42), July 18 to September 4, 2025

""The CFS, through its Food Incident Surveillance System, noted a notice issued by United States Department of Agriculture indicating that the above-mentioned products might have been contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes and are being recalled. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately followed-up the case. A preliminary investigation found that a vendor, City Super Limited, had sold one of the affected products (pack size: 12oz; use-by date: July 26, 2025),"" a spokesman for the CFS said.

The vendor concerned has stopped sales and removed from shelves the affected product, and has initiated a recall according to the CFS's instructions. Members of the public may call its hotline at 2736 3866 during office hours for enquiries about the recall of the product concerned.

""Listeria monocytogenes can be easily destroyed by cooking but can survive and multiply at refrigerator temperature. Most healthy individuals do not develop symptoms or only have mild symptoms like fever, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea when infected. However, severe complications such as septicaemia, meningitis or even death may occur in newborns, the elderly and those with a weaker immune system. Although infected pregnant women may just experience mild symptoms generally, the infection of Listeria monocytogenes may cause miscarriage, infant death, preterm birth, or severe infection in newborns,"" the spokesman said.

""In order to reduce the risk of listeriosis, susceptible populations such as pregnant women should consume freshly prepared hot food where possible, reheat chilled food until it is hot all the way through, and avoid high-risk foods, including ready-to-eat food such as cold cuts, cold smoked seafood, soft cheeses, salads, etc, or cook them thoroughly before consumption, even if they are presented as part of a dish.""

The CFS will alert the trade to the incident, continue to follow up and take appropriate action. An investigation is ongoing."
Construction industry joins hands with education sector to promote STEAM education (with photos),2025-07-03 21:36,2025-07-04 06:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/03/P2025070300882.htm,"  The launching ceremony of the Infrastructure x Education Exhibition and the first phase of achievement of the STEAM UP project, jointly organised by the Development Bureau and the Construction Industry Council (CIC), was held today (July 3). This is the first time for the construction industry to collaborate with the education sector to organise a large-scale exhibition featuring infrastructure projects in Hong Kong to promote STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) education related to the construction industry, thereby helping students apply STEAM knowledge through practical examples of infrastructure projects and encouraging the younger generation to join the construction industry.

  Speaking at the launching ceremony, the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, said that the construction industry and infrastructure involve many STEAM elements. The construction industry joins hands with the education sector to launch STEAM learning and teaching materials, which can make learning more effective. She hoped that, through this exhibition, infrastructure can tell the good stories of Hong Kong and share STEAM knowledge, which arouses students' interest towards the construction industry and the exploration of STEAM knowledge.

  Other officiating guests at the launching ceremony were the Permanent Secretary for Development (Works), Mr Ricky Lau; the Under Secretary for Education, Dr Sze Chun-fai; the Chairman of the CIC, Professor Thomas Ho; the Executive Director of the CIC, Mr Albert Cheng; and the Executive Director of Hong Kong Education City, Dr Tenny Lam.

  Hong Kong's first 3-dimensional Infrastructure Map supporting STEAM education was launched at the ceremony, introducing 32 types of infrastructure projects in Hong Kong and the related STEAM knowledge.

CHP investigates measles infection case epidemiologically linked to earlier cases,2025-07-03 21:03,2025-07-04 06:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/03/P2025070300853.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (July 3) is investigating a case of measles infection and reminded the public that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles.

 The case involves a 10-month-old baby boy who is a close contact of two epidemiologically linked measles infection cases announced by the CHP recently. During the investigation of these two cases, the CHP found that they had visited a private clinic in Jordan during the communicable period. The CHP immediately initiated contact tracing in the clinic and found that 21 people had stayed in the clinic at the same time as the two cases. Hence, they were classified as close contacts, including three high-risk individuals aged below one-year-old who have not yet reached the age to receive the first dose of the measles vaccine. The CHP explained the risk to the parents of the three children and recommended measles immunoglobulin injection to minimise the risk of infection. One of them agreed and received the injection arranged by the CHP at a hospital, and is now asymptomatic. The other two did not accept the injection arrangement (including the 10-month-old baby boy).

 During the medical surveillance for the close contacts, the 10-month-old baby boy presented with fever on June 30 and developed skin rash the following day. The CHP arranged him to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital on July 1 for isolation and treatment. His respiratory specimen sample tested positive for the measles virus upon nucleic acid testing. He remains hospitalised and is in stable condition.

 An epidemiological investigation revealed that the baby boy has not yet reach the age to receive the first dose of the measles vaccine. He had no travel history during the incubation period. The CHP believed that the source of infection of this case is related to the two recently confirmed measles cases.

 The baby boy's five household contacts are currently asymptomatic and are put under medical surveillance. Since two of the household contacts were uncertain whether they had received measles vaccination, the CHP has provided post-exposure vaccination for them. Another household contact is currently not in Hong Kong. The CHP has notified the relevant health authority for necessary follow-up actions. Apart from his family members, the baby boy has no other close contacts.

 There are currently four cases in this cluster, including three members of a family and the above-mentioned baby boy. The remaining two members of the family and 20 other close contacts at the clinic remain asymptomatic so far and are under continuous medical surveillance. Preliminary investigations have not revealed any epidemiological linkages between this cluster and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

 ""The incubation period of measles (i.e. the time from infection to onset of illness) is seven to 21 days. Symptoms include fever, skin rash, cough, runny nose and red eyes. When such symptoms appear, people should wear surgical masks, stay home from work or school, avoid crowded places and contact with unvaccinated people, especially those with weak immune systems, pregnant women and children under 1 year old. Those who suspect they are infected should consult their doctors as soon as possible and inform healthcare workers of their history of exposure to measles,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

 ""Under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme, the overall immunisation coverage in Hong Kong has been maintained at a very high level through the immunisation services provided by the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres and School Immunisation Teams. As evidenced by the findings on vaccination coverage of primary school students and the territory-wide immunisation surveys conducted regularly by the DH, the two-dose measles vaccination coverage has remained consistently high, well above 95 per cent, and the local seroprevalence rates of measles virus antibodies reflect that most people in Hong Kong are immune to measles. However, Hong Kong, as a city with a high volume of international travel, still faces the potential risk of importation of the measles virus and its further spread in the local community. Hence, a small number of people who have not completed a measles vaccination (such as non-local-born people including new immigrants, foreign domestic helpers, overseas employees and people coming to Hong Kong for further studies) are still at risk of being infected and spreading measles to other people who do not have immunity against measles, such as children under 1 year old who have not yet received the first dose of the measles vaccine,"" he added.

 People born before 1967 could be considered to have acquired immunity to measles through natural infection, as measles was endemic in many parts of the world and in Hong Kong at that time. People born in or after 1967 who have not yet completed the two doses of measles vaccination or whose measles vaccination history is unknown, should consult their family doctors as soon as possible to complete the vaccination and ensure adequate protection against measles.

 The number of measles cases in some overseas countries remains at a high level this year. The outbreaks in North America (including the United States and Canada), Europe and neighbouring areas (including Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines) are ongoing due to the relatively low vaccination rate. Furthermore, an increasing number of measles cases have also been recorded in Japan and Australia this year. For those who plan to travel to measles-endemic areas, they should check their vaccination records and medical history as early as possible. If they have not been diagnosed with measles through laboratory tests and have never received two doses of measles vaccine or are not sure if they have received a measles vaccine, they should consult a doctor at least two weeks prior to their trip for vaccination.

 Besides being vaccinated against measles, members of the public should take the following measures to prevent infection:


Maintain good personal and environmental hygiene;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
Keep hands clean and wash hands properly;
Wash hands when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;
Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and mouth discharge properly;
Clean used toys and furniture properly; and
Persons with measles should be kept out of school till four days from the appearance of a rash to prevent the spread of the infection to non-immune persons in school.

衞生防護中心調查一宗與早前個案有流行病學關連的麻疹個案,2025-07-03 20:15,2025-07-04 06:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/03/P2025070300807.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月三日）正調查一宗麻疹個案，並提醒市民接種疫苗是預防麻疹的最有效方法。

個案涉及一名十個月大男嬰，是中心早前公布兩宗有流行病學關連麻疹個案的密切接觸者。中心在調查上述兩宗個案時，發現他們在傳染期曾到訪佐敦一間私家診所，中心隨即在私家診所展開接觸者追蹤工作，發現21名人士曾與該兩名個案同時身處同一診所，因而被介定為密切接觸者，包括三名屬於一歲以下尚未適齡接種首劑麻疹疫苗的高風險人士。中心已向該三名幼兒的家長解釋風險及建議注射麻疹免疫球蛋白，以減低受感染機會，其中一人同意並經中心安排前往醫院接受注射，現時沒有病徵，其餘兩人沒有接受注射安排（包括上述的十個月大男嬰）。

中心為密切接觸者進行醫學監察期間，發現該名十個月大男嬰於六月三十日出現發燒，翌日出現皮疹，中心於七月一日安排他到伊利沙伯醫院就診及接受隔離治療。病人的呼吸道樣本經核酸檢測後，證實對麻疹病毒呈陽性反應。病人目前仍然留院，情況穩定。

流行病學調查顯示，男嬰尚未適齡接種第一劑麻疹疫苗。他於潛伏期內沒有外遊，中心相信他的感染源頭與早前兩宗確診麻疹個案相關。

男嬰的五名家居接觸者現時沒有病徵，正接受醫學監察。由於其中兩名家居接觸者不確定自己曾否接種麻疹疫苗，中心已安排他們接受暴露後預防疫苗接種。另有一名家居接觸者現時不在香港，中心已經通知相關衞生部門，以便作適當跟進。除家人外，男嬰沒有其他密切接觸者。

現時這個群組共涉及四宗個案，包括一個家庭的三名成員及上述男嬰。該家庭的其餘兩名成員及上述診所的其餘20名密切接觸者至今沒有出現病徵，正繼續接受醫學監察。初步調查亦未發現這群組個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「麻疹的潛伏期（即由感染後到發病的時間）為七至21日。麻疹病徵包括發燒、皮膚出現紅疹、咳嗽、流鼻水和眼紅等。當出現相關病徵，市民應戴上外科口罩，停止上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方和避免與未有免疫力人士接觸，尤其是抵抗力弱人士、孕婦及未滿一歲的兒童。懷疑受感染的人士應盡早向醫生求診及告知醫護人員有麻疹接觸史。」

他續說：「在『香港兒童免疫接種計劃』下，透過衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院及學童免疫注射小組提供的免疫接種服務，本港整體免疫接種覆蓋率一直維持在非常高水平。根據小學學童的免疫接種覆蓋率及衞生署定期進行全港免疫接種覆蓋調查顯示，兩劑麻疹疫苗接種的整體覆蓋率一直維持在95%以上，而本地麻疹病毒抗體的血清陽性率反映絕大部分香港市民對麻疹已有免疫力。然而，香港作為國際旅遊頻繁的城市，仍面對輸入麻疹病毒及其在本地社區進一步傳播的潛在風險。少數未完成接種麻疹疫苗的人士（例如非本地出生人士，包括新移民、外傭、海外僱員及來港升學人士）仍有機會受感染，並把麻疹傳播給其他未具備麻疹免疫力人士，例如一歲以下尚未接種第一劑麻疹疫苗的幼兒。」

在一九六七年前出生的市民，由於當時麻疹在全球多個地方及香港仍屬風土病，故可視為透過自然感染而對麻疹具備免疫力。一九六七年或以後出生而尚未完成接種兩劑麻疹疫苗或對麻疹疫苗接種史不詳的人士，應盡快諮詢家庭醫生以完成接種，以確保市民對麻疹有足夠保護力。

今年部分海外國家的麻疹個案維持在高水平，其中北美洲（包括美國及加拿大）、歐洲及鄰近地區（包括越南、柬埔寨和菲律賓），因疫苗覆蓋接種率偏低而出現麻疹持續爆發。另外，日本和澳洲今年錄得的麻疹個案亦有所上升。因此，計劃前往麻疹流行地區的市民，應及早檢視自己的疫苗接種紀錄及病歷，若以往未經化驗確診感染麻疹，以及從未或不確定曾否接種兩劑麻疹疫苗，應在出發前最少兩星期諮詢醫生接種疫苗。

除接種麻疹疫苗外，市民應採取以下措施預防感染麻疹：

• 維持良好的個人及環境衞生；
•保持室內空氣流通；
•保持雙手清潔，並用正確的方法洗手；
•雙手被呼吸系統分泌物弄污後（如打噴嚏後）應立即洗手；
•打噴嚏或咳嗽時要掩着口鼻，並妥善清理口鼻排出的分泌物；
•徹底清潔用過的玩具和家具；及
•病患者在出疹後的四日內不應上學，避免將疾病傳染給未有免疫力的人。

Keynote speech by Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services) at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited's Integrated Fund Platform Order Routing Service Launch Ceremony (English only) (with photos),2025-07-03 19:44,2025-07-04 06:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/03/P2025070300764.htm,"  Following is the keynote speech by the Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services), Ms Salina Yan, at the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX)'s Integrated Fund Platform Order Routing Service Launch Ceremony today (July 3):

Bonnie (Chief Executive Officer of the HKEX, Ms Bonnie Chan), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 It is my great pleasure to join you all today at the Launch Ceremony of the Order Routing Service under the Integrated Fund Platform operated by the HKEX.

 Digital infrastructure is key to the operation and development of the modern-day capital market. Today's launch ceremony signifies a solid step in the construction of a market-wide infrastructure for our fund management industry leveraging the advancement in technology.

 For the first six months of this year - 2025, the Hong Kong stock market's daily turnover reached HK$240 billion on average, up 118 per cent year on year. We also saw 44 IPOs (initial public offerings) raising a total of HK$107 billion, surpassing the annual figure of 2024 by 22 per cent and assuming a leading position in the world's IPO fund raised during the same period this year.

 Fund flows in the collective investment scheme and asset management space are equally active. As of end-March 2025, for Hong Kong-domiciled funds, an overall net inflow of about HK$343 billion was recorded over the past 12 months, representing an increase of 285 per cent year on year. The AUM (assets under management) surged by close to 40 per cent, and the number of licensed corporations providing asset management services rose by about 5 per cent.

 As our capital market continues to grow in depth and breadth, we need to maintain the robustness and nimbleness of our backbone infrastructure to keep up with the demand and cater for future development. Legislative framework and regulatory regimes also have to be refreshed from time to time in order to bring out the growth potential in the marketplace and remove bottlenecks and inefficiencies that may exist.

 For example, to enrich the suite of products that can be made available to the market, the Government has amended the Securities and Futures Ordinance and enacted a new piece of legislation to introduce the open-ended fund company or OFC and limited partnership fund or LPF regimes to enable funds to set up in company and limited partnership forms. The diversified fund structures have been well received. As of the end of May this year, over 560 OFCs have been set up, and nearly 1 150 LPFs have been established in Hong Kong.

 In addition, we keep enhancing our connectivity with the Mainland market. For example, since the launch of the Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect (WMC) 2.0 in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in February 2024 which, among other enhancement measures, allowed the investment quota per investor to go up to RMB3 million, there has been a significant increase in the number of investors and amount of cross-boundary fund remittances. As of end-May 2025, some 158 000 individual investors participated in the WMC. Cross-boundary fund remittances amounted to over RMB115 billion, around seven times increase compared with WMC 1.0.

 We are also expanding our international network. Two ETFs (exchange-traded funds) tracking Hong Kong indices were listed on the Saudi Exchange last year. In May this year, we saw Asia's first investment-grade sukuk ETF listing in Hong Kong, as well as a new Mutual Recognition of Funds arrangement reached with Ireland.

 All these market development initiatives are going hand in hand with the upgrading of our financial market infrastructure. The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government has been working with parties concerned to establish paperless, straight-through and one-stop integrated digital platforms for the provision of financial services, taking advantage of fintech developments and the rise of blockchain and AI. The goal is to increase efficiency and lower costs. As a key market operator, the HKEX has an important role to play in this, and we are very pleased to have the HKEX's active participation and partnership in this journey.

 The implementation of an uncertificated securities market in Hong Kong, for example, will be a significant step towards modernising our securities market. It will allow individual investors to own securities in their names without a paper certificate and manage transactions through a digitalised platform. The Government, in collaboration with the Securities and Futures Commission and the HKEX, has completed all the relevant legislative work this year, with a view to launching the regime in the first half of 2026 following market preparations.

 Moving from securities to funds, I am glad to note that the first phase of the Integrated Fund Platform, the Fund Repository, has received positive responses for its comprehensive coverage and ease of use. I am also very pleased to note that the second phase of the Platform, the Order Routing Service launched today, has attracted the participation of major banks, transfer agents, brokers and fund houses. Leveraging the Communications Network developed jointly with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the Order Routing Service provides end-to-end transmission of subscription and redemption orders among fund distributors and transfer agents. I understand that development work on additional functionalities in the next phase, including nominee services and facilitation of payment and settlement, is under way.

 The development of an efficient and vibrant fund distribution ecosystem will drive market efficiency and lower transaction costs. This would in turn benefit end-investors and help realise our vision as the world's top asset management hub and strengthening our status as an international financial centre. I congratulate the HKEX and its partner organisations on reaching this milestone and look forward to the full operation of a one-stop Platform encompassing the entire functionalities taking heed of user experience and stakeholder feedback. Thank you."
Public consultation on Legislative Council Election proposed guidelines commences (with photos/video),2025-07-03 19:20,2025-07-04 06:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/03/P2025070300378.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Electoral Affairs Commission:

 The Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) today (July 3) released the proposed guidelines on election-related activities in respect of the Legislative Council (LegCo) Election for public consultation. The consultation will last for 30 days until August 1.

 The 2025 LegCo General Election will be held on December 7. Before each general election, the EAC will review and update the guidelines.

 The Chairman of the EAC, Mr Justice David Lok, said at a press conference today, ""These guidelines aim to explain in simple language the provisions under current electoral legislation with a view to reminding candidates and other relevant persons of the regulations and requirements of the electoral legislation; and to promulgate a code of conduct based on the fair and equal treatment principles in respect of election-related activities which are not covered by the legislation.""

The proposed guidelines are prepared on the basis of the current guidelines for the LegCo Election (October 2021 edition), with appropriate amendments which are mainly composed of four categories: (1) to reflect the amended electoral legislation, such as the procedures if electronic counting arrangements are adopted in functional constituency elections; (2) to reflect the latest electoral arrangements and facilitation measures, for instance, electors could log on to an online system to check information such as their allocated polling stations, and candidates could submit election forms via electronic means, etc; (3) to further elaborate the contents of the guidelines to enable candidates and other relevant persons to have a clearer understanding of the areas which they should pay attention to; and (4) to align with the amendments already made to the other guidelines on election-related activities.

Mr Justice Lok said, ""To enable the public to better understand the requirements of the relevant electoral legislation and the code of conduct formulated by the EAC for the conduct of election-related activities, we have also enhanced the proposed guidelines by, for example, explaining the relevant electoral arrangements in the form of tables, consolidating the contents of the chapters, etc, with a view to making the proposed guidelines more concise and easy to comprehend.""

 The proposed guidelines can be downloaded from the EAC website (www.eac.hk), or viewed at the Registration and Electoral Office, the Home Affairs Enquiry Centres of all district offices and the major and district public libraries.

Members of the public are welcome to make written representations on the proposed guidelines to the EAC Secretariat by email (eacenq@eac.hk), post (8/F, Treasury Building, 3 Tonkin Street West, Cheung Sha Wan, Kowloon) or fax (2511 1682) on or before August 1. For representations submitted by post, the postmark date will be taken as the submission date. Late submissions will not be considered.

發展局局長出席「基建x教育」展覽暨「STEAM UP想建理」第一階段成果啟動禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-07-03 18:56,2025-07-04 06:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/03/P2025070300734.htm,"以下是發展局局長甯漢豪今日（七月三日）出席「基建x教育」展覽暨「STEAM UP想建理」第一階段成果啟動禮的致辭全文：

建造業議會Thomas主席（建造業議會主席何安誠教授）、教育局副局長Jeff（教育局副局長施俊輝博士）、在座很多位立法會議員，以及在座很多來自建造業界和教育界的朋友：

大家好！首先今日這個場合是建造業界和教育界兩個界別的朋友聚首一堂，這是很新鮮的組合，亦代表這個場合別具意思。我知道在座有很多位校長，與大家分享一下，其實我於二○○五至二○○八年曾經在教育局服務，所以我與教育界有少許淵源，可能是緣分問題，經過一個轉，今日又在此以發展局局長的身分與教育界各位校長、教師和同學見面。

啟動基建教育基建說故事

​首先我問大家一個問題，究竟建造業與教育有甚麼關係？聽起來好像扯不上，但其實原來可以很有關係。用一個很簡單的例子，不知道大家有沒有去過將軍澳跨灣大橋，無論是跑步、踏單車或散步也好。將軍澳跨灣大橋使用我們稱為浮托法的方法安裝橋體，而浮托法原來與我們小學科學科亦有學習的潮汐和浮力有關，以及與中學科學科有關橋的力學及工程原理有關；另外這跨灣大橋使用高強度鋼材，與高中同學學習化學及科技科亦有關。這條橋是雙拱鋼橋的外型，大家去到可能會留意到它像一個數學符號，但如果用審美的角度看，它亦有藝術美感的感覺。剛才只是單單講一條大橋，已經涵蓋所有STEAM的元素，五個元素是科學、科技、工程、藝術及數學，所以我們以建造業和基建內容推動在學校內教授STEAM，我希望在座各位校長都覺得是很合適的題材。其實我們有此舉措是參考了校長及老師的意見，認為如果教授STEAM時，有一些實際案例、有一些項目，會讓大家的教學事半功倍。我們旁邊亦有六個展區，希望經過的朋友稍後有機會去看，這六個展區介紹香港的基建項目，我們希望藉這些展區講好我們建造業的故事。

推廣香港作為國際基建中心

講到說好香港故事，其實我們的基建設施在方便度及可靠程度是世界上首屈一指。這不是我們自己自吹自擂，最近國際管理發展學院發布的《2025年報》（《2025年世界競爭力年報》）再次肯定香港為全球最具競爭力的經濟體之一，香港排第三，如果再仔細看這個報告內的分項，香港在「基礎建設」這個環節的競爭力中，我們的排名亦有所上升，至全球第七位。大家見到我們面前展示的全港首個立體基建地圖，稍後這個地圖會巡迴於各區展出，希望市民看到我們的基建真的會感到自豪。我們都會繼續努力，希望把香港打造成國際基建中心。

建造業的專業與創科應用

希望在此為各位經過的朋友和教育界朋友介紹，我們的建造業涵蓋建築、測量、規劃、園境及工程數個專業，而當中的建造工種超過140項，其實整個建造業是一個最講求跨專業、講求團體合作精神的行業，所以建造業近年亦大力推動使用創新科技，希望跨專業的「跨度」再「跨」出去，與創新科技連繫。大家今日留意到整個場地有很多元素都與創新科技有關。我知道一會兒有一個環節亦與AI有關，AI人工智能與同學有一些互動。

STEAM UP想建理——教育與建造聯乘譜出「想」、「建」、「理」

今日我們亦借這個場合與大家分享一個項目的成果，這是甚麼項目呢，就是我們的「STEAM UP想建理」項目。「STEAM UP想建理」這個項目的名字其實有其特別之處，不過我不在此浪費大家時間，容許大家一會兒自己發掘為何名為「STEAM UP想建理」。我們想與大家分享甚麼呢，就是透過這個項目，政府部門和建造業界不同的學會和商會，大家合力為教育界製作了一套教材，這套教材亦有我們負責的同事現身說法，為大家介紹關於建造業和STEAM的種種理論。這套教材的面世，我真的要感謝在座很多建造業界的學會、商會和專業同事，亦有大學、培訓機構和工會的齊齊參與，當中放了很多人力、物力，在此很感謝大家付出寶貴的時間和經驗分享。

建造與教育聯乘——香港人才跨界別協作範例

我希望在座的校長或教師都有一個共鳴，就是做這個項目，其實是讓建造業和教育界的專業人士一起合作。我知道我們的工程師都有做老師，相反我們的老師亦有嘗試去學一些關於建造業的知識，例如BIM建築信息模擬技術。

結語

說到這裏，我希望大家手上或袋裏都有一本《基建教育報》的創刊號，大家可以留意總結部分，總結部分其實是由我們的同學進行了訪問，同學們訪問了發展局的劉俊傑常任秘書長（工務）、建造業議會Thomas主席和六位工務部門首長。大家看這些訪問會留意到一個共通點，所有同學都不約而同地說不知道為何這些受訪對象講到工程建造項目時，就會眉飛色舞。我每一日都有接觸這些工程師，其實我每一日都受到他們感染。這正正告訴我們，原來你了解多些某一個行業，自己亦會對那個行業有一種熱情，而這份熱情是可以感染其他人的，所以我們很希望透過這次活動，用基建說好香港故事，亦用基建分享STEAM知識，讓我們透過知識分享，引發同學對建造業和探求STEAM知識的興趣，亦感謝教育界的朋友與我們crossover。各位校長，我通常看到校長都會站得直一點，我以前在教育局都是這樣提自己，看到校長一定會立正。在此再次感謝教育界的朋友給予這個機會，和我們的建造業界一起合作。多謝大家。"

"Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected counterfeit goods worth over $72 million in ""Ocean Shield"" operation (with photos)",2025-07-03 17:45,2025-07-04 06:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/03/P2025070300638.htm,"Hong Kong Customs conducted a four-week enforcement operation codenamed ""Ocean Shield"" from May 28 to June 27 to combat counterfeit and infringing goods activities involving cross-boundary transshipments by sea cargo and local deliveries. During the operation, Customs detected 36 related cases and seized about 157 000 items of suspected counterfeit goods with a total estimated market value of over $72 million.

Through intelligence analysis and detailed investigations, Customs detected a number of related cases at various local logistics companies. Customs officers identified and carried out strike-and-search operations at about 30 logistics companies in Kwai Chung, Tin Shui Wai, Tsuen Wan, Tsing Yi and Yuen Long. About 154 000 items of suspected counterfeit goods, including watches, mobile phone accessories, glasses, clothes and footwear, with a total estimated market value of about $70 million, were seized.

After follow-up investigations, Customs believed that some of the seized suspected counterfeit goods would have been sold locally while the rest would have been re-exported to overseas destinations. Customs officers therefore organised controlled delivery operations in respect of two batches of seized items. On June 6, a 45-year-old male consignee was arrested at a retail shop in Mong Kok, and about 20 suspected counterfeit wireless headphones and speakers with an estimated value of about $32,000 were discovered inside the shop.

Later, on June 18, Customs officers seized about 300 suspected counterfeit wireless headphones and speakers, with an estimated market value of about $1.2 million, in an industrial building unit in Kwai Chung. A 53-year-old female staff member, a 42-year-old male director and a 43-year-old female director were arrested.

Investigations of the above-mentioned cases are ongoing. All arrested persons have been released on bail pending further investigation.

Customs appeals to consumers to purchase goods at reputable shops or websites to avoid buying counterfeit or infringing goods. Practitioners in the logistics industry should also comply with the requirements of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (TDO) and to check with the trademark owners or authorised agents if the authenticity of a product is in doubt. Traders should also be cautious and prudent in merchandising since selling counterfeit goods is a serious crime, and offenders are liable to criminal sanctions.

Customs will continue to step up inspections and conduct intelligence-led enforcement actions to vigorously combat different types of counterfeit and infringing goods activities.

Under the TDO, any person who imports or exports, or sells or possesses for sale any goods to which a forged trademark is applied commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

Members of the public may report any suspected counterfeiting activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Shanghai Xuhui Chiangqiao Jiangnan Silk and Bamboo Ensemble to make Hong Kong debut at Chinese Culture Festival 2025 in August (with photos),2025-07-03 17:25,2025-07-04 06:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/03/P2025070300507.htm,"  The Chinese Culture Festival (CCF) 2025, organised by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), has invited the Shanghai Xuhui Chiangqiao Jiangnan Silk and Bamboo Ensemble (the ensemble) to make its Hong Kong debut and stage two concerts in early August. As a representative inheritor organisation of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Shanghai Municipality, the ensemble's three representative inheritors of Jiangnan silk and bamboo, along with young professional musicians, will perform a selection of classical pieces from the ""Eight Masterpieces of Silk and Bamboo Music"" (""Eight Masterpieces"") and other famous compositions. Through century-old string and wind music, they will evoke the authentic cultural essence of the Jiangnan region.

  Jiangnan silk and bamboo music is a traditional form of ensemble music popular in the southern Jiangsu, western Zhejiang and Shanghai regions, featuring Chinese string (silk) and wind (bamboo) instruments, such as erhu, yangqin, pipa, sanxian, dizi and sheng. It was inscribed on the first list of Intangible Cultural Heritage at the National Level in 2006. Its artistic style is characterised by qualities including delicacy, lightness, finesse and elegance. With diverse variation techniques such as ""slowing down"" (expanding the original melody's rhythm and phrasing) and ""ornamentation"" (inserting new ornamental notes into the melody), complemented by synergy among the musicians and improvisation, the music presents a fascinating kaleidoscope of sound. The repertoire of Jiangnan silk and bamboo music is vast, with the ""Eight Masterpieces"" being the most representative of the works.

  Zhou Feng (dizi) and Liu Yuehua (erhu), the representative inheritors of Jiangnan silk and bamboo of Shanghai Municipality, and Mi Peirong (yangqin), representative inheritor of Jiangnan silk and bamboo of Xuhui District, together with accomplished performers of sheng, pipa and sanxian will present two concerts featuring compositions from the ""Eight Masterpieces"", including ""Song of Joy"", ""Sanliu"" and ""Zhonghua Liuban"" as well as famous silk and bamboo classics ""Song of the Warm Southerly Breeze"" and ""Song of Yang Ba"". Furthermore, each concert will feature distinctive selections: the first concert will present ""Man Liuban"" and ""Festival March"" from the ""Eight Masterpieces"", along with the celebrated silk and bamboo piece ""Rainbow Skirt Song"". The second concert will feature ""Cloud Celebration"" and ""Best Wishes"" from the ""Eight Masterpieces"", as well as the beloved ""Moonlight on the Spring River"".

  The Shanghai Xuhui Chiangqiao Jiangnan Silk and Bamboo Ensemble is dedicated to safeguarding and passing on traditional Jiangnan silk and bamboo music in its pristine form. The ensemble's members have inherited their musical heritage from previous generations in the family, with decades of performing experience and deep mastery of traditional playing techniques of the musical art form. In 2024, the ensemble was recognised as being among the seventh batch of representative inheritor organisations of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Shanghai Municipality.

  The first concert by the Shanghai Xuhui Chiangqiao Jiangnan Silk and Bamboo Ensemble will be held at 8pm on August 2 (Saturday) at the Theatre of Ngau Chi Wan Civic Centre. The second concert will be held at 8pm on August 3 (Sunday) at the Theatre of Sheung Wan Civic Centre. Tickets priced at $220 and $280 are now available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk).

政制及內地事務局局長出席立法會政制事務委員會特別會議開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-03 16:46,2025-07-04 06:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/03/P2025070300568.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞今日（七月三日）出席立法會政制事務委員會特別會議的開場發言︰

主席，各位委員：

我感謝黎棟國主席召開今日的特別會議，讓政府有機會向各位委員匯報政府就終審法院岑子杰司法覆核案（《岑子杰案》）的判決的跟進工作，亦感謝各位委員出席今天的會議。

政府就跟進《岑子杰案》的建議方案及未來路向已經在委員會文件中陳述。我今天的發言會比較詳細，以向各位委員闡述政府對《岑子杰案》判決的立場、政府計劃就同性伴侶關係登記的建議機制、建議機制背後的理據以及政府下一步的跟進工作，為大家作介紹。

首先，我必須重申政府對婚姻制度的一貫立場。《基本法》明確保障香港一夫一妻、一男一女的婚姻制度。我們必須以此婚姻制度作為基礎，任何政策及政策方針都不應偏離。終審法院就《岑子杰案》頒下的判決中亦明確指出，香港居民根據《基本法》第三十七條及《人權法案》（《香港人權法案》）第十九條第二款受《憲法》所保證和保障的婚姻憲法自由只限於異性婚姻，並把同性婚姻排除在外。

然而，法院同時亦裁定政府在《香港人權法案》第十四條所保障的私生活權利上，有積極義務確立替代框架讓同性伴侶關係獲得法律承認，並制定就該等承認所伴隨的適當權利和責任。法院明確指出在替代框架下登記的同性伴侶關係並不等同於婚姻關係，而在決定所須擬定的承認框架時，包括當中應包含甚麼權利和責任，政府與立法機關「享有彈性的酌情空間」。

終審法院根據《基本法》行使終審權，其判決是最終且決定性的，對訴訟各方包括政府均有約束力。政府雖然明白社會對同性伴侶這個具爭議性的議題依然存在不同意見，但在尊重法院所頒布的判決的前提下，我們仍積極履行義務制定一個替代框架，以符合《人權法案》第十四條的要求。

制定替代框架涉及複雜且廣泛的議題。在法院作出判決後，特區政府一直就制定替代框架進行詳細研究，仔細考慮所涉及的多個政策和範疇，並考量相關的影響。我們亦詳細參考了立法會於本年二月十二日就「守護本港一夫一妻、一男一女的婚姻制度」的動議辯論議案及議員所提出的意見。

我們目前建議的替代框架力求顧及各方的意見並作出適當平衡，確保一方面符合法院的要求，同時亦顧及香港的實際情況，家庭及社會傳統價值觀等因素。建議的登記制度在保障登記人的權益之餘，亦要避免濫用情況，並確保不會對本港婚姻制度及社會傳統價值觀造成衝擊，避免造成社會分化，影響社會和諧。

接着，我會介紹政府建議的同性伴侶關係登記機制的內容。在登記條件方面，我們建議同性伴侶在提出登記申請時須符合六項條件:

（一）雙方的性別相同；

（二）雙方均已年滿18歲。我們認為登記雙方都應為成年人，以確保他們心智成熟及具備法律行為能力作出此重要且具法律效力的決定。根據《成年歲數（有關條文）條例》（第410章），本港的成年歲數為18歲，而在我們的研究中，大部分其他的司法管轄區均以18歲為可在註冊有效的同性婚姻、同性民事伴侶關係或同性民事結合的法定年齡；

（三）雙方或一方為香港居民。我們認為替代框架只應提供與香港有緊密連繫的同性伴侶作出登記，這一方面切合香港的實際情況，並且不會過度延伸以致對香港的傳統價值觀和觀念造成太大的衝擊；

（四）雙方已在香港以外的地方，根據當地的法律，註冊有效的同性婚姻、同性民事伴侶關係或同性民事結合。

在這方面，我們注意到今日有傳媒的報導中，引述個別人士，包括《岑子杰案》中的當事人岑子杰先生的一些意見，當中認為本項登記要求會對同性伴侶造成很大的困難，亦無法回應本地伴侶的實際需要。這是我們由報章所得的，我們重申。因此，我希望在這裏多說一些我們制訂相關規定的考慮。

首先，我必須強調，今次終審法院的裁決是政府未有履行《香港人權法案》第十四條的積極義務設立替代框架以法律承認同性伴侶的關係，而所指的同性伴侶關係是指一段既承諾並且穩定的關係，這是理所當然的，判詞中亦多次提及，否則既不承諾又不穩定的關係承認就根本無從說起，更遑論要因而賦予他們一些特定的權利和義務。而作為負責登記並賦予承認他們關係的政府，亦責無旁貸地需要確認有關關係確實為承諾並且穩定的，才能予以法律上的承認。

而在確認的程序上，政府是可以有不同的考慮和選擇的，例如可以按傳統的做法透過與登記人的會面和會談，或要求登記人提供一些證明文件，如生活照、雙方一起生活的一些具體證明等等，甚至在一些不確定或可疑的情況下，查看一些相關的紀錄如出入境紀錄等，而在整個核實過程中，難免需要登記人的配合。但在登記人眼中，在他們來說，這些詳細的核查程序可能就會成為他們眼中的一種滋擾，甚至認為是對其私人生活上的一種干擾。但作為負責任的執法人員，我們亦別無選擇需要確切及有效地執行我們的工作和履行我們的責任。而另一種選擇的方式就是按我們目前的建議，承認其他國家或地區依法成功登記的同性關係為承諾及穩定的關係，有關做法的好處是有一套較清晰及可供驗證的準則，在行政執行上較為可行，同時亦盡量減少對登記人可能造成的不便。至於所謂要前往外地進行登記的困難，現時世界上有超過30個國家和地區均設有同性婚姻或伴侶的登記安排，有些甚至還提供網上登記的安排，我們相信對一般人而言這應不會構成太大的困難。說到底，這是個選擇的問題，哪種方式會較便利，而哪種方式又可能會造成不便，大家都必須要仔細考量，否則當政策一旦有所改變而導致出現更為不便的情況，反而未必是對相關人士的最佳安排。

這裏我也奉勸一些公開發表言論的人士，在發表言論時請以負責任和深思熟慮的態度進行，否則一些不切實際甚至會為同行人士帶來不良或不利影響的言論不但於事無補，甚至可能會是有害而無益的；

（五）雙方各自沒有任何有效的與第三方註冊的婚姻、民事伴侶關係或民事結合。這是符合社會的一般道德標準和要求，同時亦是一段穩定關係的基礎；

（六）雙方的關係須在親等限制關係以外。我們會加入親等限制，以避免有血緣、近親等關係的人士作出登記。這點相信大家亦不難理解和接受。

在登記手續方面，政府建議設立同性伴侶關係登記處，由政制及內地事務局局長所委任的公職人員擔任登記官，為同性伴侶登記手續。符合所有登記條件的申請人士可經預約辦理相關登記手續。申請時，登記雙方須提供相關的文件及資料以確認其符合所有登記條件，同時亦須親身到登記處面見登記官並進行宣誓。若登記官信納並確認有關申請符合所有登記條件，會批准向申請人發出同性伴侶關係登記的證書，申請人可藉此證書在法律上證明其同性伴侶關係。若發現申請人在申請過程中可能涉及任何違法行為，例如提交偽造文件、作出虛假陳述等，登記處會轉介執法部門作出跟進。

除法律承認外，終審法院亦要求政府制定伴隨的適當權利和責任。法院同時亦指出，同性伴侶應享有甚麼權利，政府有彈性的酌情空間。我們經仔細考量後，建議獲法律承認的同性伴侶可享有以下四類基本權利：

（一）登記同性伴侶關係：此項權利關乎符合登記條件的同性伴侶可以在替代框架下登記並獲得法律承認其同性伴侶關係；

（二）撤除同性伴侶關係：此項權利關乎已在登記處成功登記同性伴侶關係的同性伴侶在雙方同意或在特定情況下有權申請撤除相關登記；

（三）參與同性伴侶醫療相關的事宜：包括醫院探視、獲取醫療資訊、參與醫療決定、當同性伴侶一方處於危及生命處境時，其個人資料可獲豁免於《個人資料（私隱）條例》（第486章）保障資料原則的限制以及同性伴侶間的器官移植；

（四）處理同性伴侶身後事宜：包括申請死亡相關證明書、於公眾殮房辨認遺體、領回遺體及辦理殯葬事宜、使用食物環境衞生署轄下墳場、火葬場及骨灰安置所以及同性伴侶可決定是否將同性伴侶遺體作治療、醫學教育或研究用途。

根據法律意見，特區政府有積極義務確立替代框架讓同性伴侶關係獲得法律承認，而法律承認是指同性伴侶關係在法律上獲得官方及正式承認和保障。因此，政府必須透過立法方式制定有關框架。我們計劃稍後向立法會提交《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》予立法會審議，以設立替代框架下的登記機制。

主席，我的介紹完畢。今日一同出席會議的，除了我政制及內地事務局的同事外，亦有律政司的代表，我們樂意聽取各位委員的意見，並解答各位的提問。多謝主席。"

A hot and relatively dry June,2025-07-03 15:00,2025-07-04 06:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/03/P2025070300289.htm,"The weather of June 2025 was hotter and drier than usual in Hong Kong, mainly attributed to the stronger subtropical ridge covering southeastern China. The monthly mean minimum temperature of 27.1 degrees was 0.6 degrees above the normal and one of the fifth highest on record for June. The monthly mean maximum temperature of 31.5 degrees and the monthly mean temperature of 28.9 degrees were 0.8 degrees and 0.6 degrees above their corresponding normals and both were among the seventh on record for June. The total rainfall in the month was 237.3 millimetres, about 48 per cent of the normal of 491.5 millimetres. With all six months drier than usual, the accumulated rainfall recorded in the first half of the year was only 444.4 millimetres, about 41 per cent of the normal of 1 082.5 millimetres for the same period and the fifth lowest on record for the same period.

With the easterly airstream prevailing over the coast of Guangdong replaced by a southerly airstream, it was hot with sunny periods and there were one or two showers in Hong Kong on the first two days of the month. When a trough of low pressure moved across the coast of Guangdong on June 3, the local weather turned mainly cloudy with a few showers. An upper-air disturbance and a surface trough of low pressure brought showers to the northern part of the South China Sea and its coastal areas the next day. Locally, it was cloudy with showers. There were thunderstorms in the afternoon. More than 20 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over Lantau Island and the western part of the New Territories. While it was still mainly cloudy with one or two showers on June 5, it became hot with sunny periods the next day, as the anticyclone aloft covering the coast of southeastern China strengthened gradually. Under the dominance of the anticyclone aloft, the local weather was generally fine with prolonged heat from June 7 to 10. It was extremely hot on June 10 with the maximum temperature at the Observatory soaring to 35.6 degrees, levelling the record maximum for June since records began in 1884. The maximum temperature at Lau Fau Shan even reached 38.9 degrees, the highest record so far since the setup of the station in 1985.

Wutip formed as a tropical depression over the central part of the South China Sea on the night of June 10. It tracked generally west-northwestward towards Hainan Island and intensified gradually. Its outer rainbands occasionally brought squally showers to the northern part of the South China Sea and the coast of Guangdong. The Observatory issued the first tropical cyclone warning signal of the year on June 11. Locally, the weather deteriorated gradually with a few squally showers that day. While there were sunny intervals during the day, there were also isolated thunderstorms in the afternoon. Wutip further intensified into a severe tropical storm on June 12 and gradually turned to a north-northeasterly track over Beibu Wan, skirting the western coast of Hainan Island and Leizhou Peninsula in the following two days. Under the influence of Wutip's outer rainbands, there were squally showers locally from June 12 to 14, with thunderstorms on June 12 and 13. The showers were heavy with more than 30 millimetres of rainfall recorded over most parts of the territory on June 13. The strong winds associated with Wutip affected the Pearl River Estuary and its vicinity on June 15. Local winds were generally strong, occasionally reaching gale force on high ground. Winds moderated progressively later in the afternoon. While moving northeastwards further into inland areas, Wutip weakened gradually and finally degenerated into an area of low pressure on the evening of June 15. Locally, there were still a few squally showers that day.

  Under the influence of an active southwesterly airstream, showers and thunderstorms affected Hong Kong on June 16 and 17. The showers were heavy with squally thunderstorms on June 17. More than 30 millimetres of rainfall were generally recorded over the territory, and rainfall even exceeded 70 millimetres in the northern part of the New Territories, Tsuen Wan and Sai Kung Districts. With a southerly airstream affecting the coast of Guangdong, it was hot with sunny intervals in the following five days. Meanwhile, there were also occasional showers, with isolated thunderstorms on June 19 and 20. More than 20 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over the eastern part of the New Territories on June 20, and the eastern parts of Hong Kong Island and the New Territories on June 21. While the southerly airstream continued to bring showers and isolated thunderstorms at first on June 23, with an anticyclone aloft covering southern China, the weather became generally fine and very hot that afternoon, and remained so in the following two days. Furthermore, an area of low pressure over the central and northern parts of the South China Sea intensified into a tropical depression on June 25 and moved northwestward towards the eastern part of Hainan Island and Leizhou Peninsula. Its outer rainbands brought heavy showers and squally thunderstorms to Hong Kong the next day. Around 30 millimetres of rainfall were generally recorded over the territory, and rainfall even exceeded 50 millimetres over Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. A broad trough of low pressure and an upper-air disturbance affected the coast of Guangdong and brought showers and thunderstorms over the territory on June 27 and 28. The showers were heavy in the small hours of June 28, around 30 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over many places, and rainfall even exceeded 50 millimetres over Tai Po. With the broad trough of low pressure lingering over the coast of Guangdong, the weather remained mainly cloudy with occasionally heavy showers and thunderstorms on the last two days of the month. Around 20 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over Kowloon East and Sha Tin on June 29. More than 30 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over most parts of the territory, and rainfall even exceeded 50 millimetres in Kowloon East and the eastern part of the New Territories on June 30.

Three tropical cyclones occurred over the South China Sea and the western North Pacific in June 2025.

Details of issuance and cancellation of various warnings/signals in the month are summarised in Table 1. Monthly meteorological figures and departures from normal for June are tabulated in Table 2."

由於影響廣東沿岸的偏東氣流被一股偏南氣流取代，六月首兩日本港天氣炎熱，部分時間有陽光及有一兩陣驟雨。隨着一道低壓槽於六月三日橫過廣東沿岸，本地天氣轉為大致多雲及有幾陣驟雨。翌日高空擾動及一道地面低壓槽為南海北部及其沿岸地區帶來驟雨，而本港多雲及有驟雨，下午有雷暴。大嶼山及新界西部錄得超過20毫米雨量。六月五日仍然大致多雲及有一兩陣驟雨，但由於覆蓋中國東南沿岸的高空反氣旋逐漸增強，翌日本港天氣轉為炎熱及部分時間有陽光。在高空反氣旋支配下，六月七日至十日本港普遍天晴，高溫天氣持續。六月十日天氣極端酷熱，天文台錄得最高氣溫35.6度，平了自一八八四年有紀錄以來六月份的最高，而流浮山的最高氣溫更達到38.9度，是該站自一九八五年啓用以來的最高。

熱帶低氣壓蝴蝶於六月十日晚上在南海中部形成，隨後大致向西北偏西移向海南島，並逐漸增強。其外圍雨帶間中為南海北部及廣東沿岸帶來狂風驟雨。天文台於六月十一日發出全年首個熱帶氣旋警告信號。當日本港天氣逐漸轉壞，有幾陣狂風驟雨，日間短暫時間有陽光，但下午局部地區有雷暴。六月十二日蝴蝶進一步增強為強烈熱帶風暴，並在北部灣逐漸轉向東北偏北移動，隨後兩日掠過海南島西部沿岸及雷州半島。受蝴蝶的外圍雨帶影響，六月十二日至十四日本港有狂風驟雨，而六月十二日至十三日有雷暴。六月十三日有大驟雨，本港大部分地區錄得超過30毫米雨量。與蝴蝶相關的強風於六月十五日影響珠江口及其附近區域。當日本港普遍吹強風，高地間中吹烈風，下午稍後風勢逐漸緩和。隨着蝴蝶向東北移動進一步移入內陸並逐漸減弱，最後於六月十五日黃昏減弱為低壓區。當日本港仍有幾陣狂風驟雨。

受一股活躍西南氣流影響，六月十六日至十七日本港有驟雨及雷暴。六月十七日有大驟雨及狂風雷暴，本港普遍錄得超過30毫米雨量，而新界北部、荃灣及西貢區的雨量更超過70毫米。隨着一股偏南氣流影響廣東沿岸，隨後五日本港天氣炎熱及短暫時間有陽光。與此同時，本港間中有驟雨，而六月十九日至二十日局部地區有雷暴。六月二十日新界東部及六月二十一日港島東部和新界東部均錄得超過20毫米雨量。偏南氣流於六月二十三日初時仍為本港帶來驟雨及局部地區雷暴，但隨着高空反氣旋覆蓋華南，當日下午天氣轉為普遍天晴及酷熱，並持續至隨後兩日。此外，位於南海中北部的一個低壓區於六月二十五日增強為熱帶低氣壓，並向西北移向海南島東部及雷州半島。其外圍雨帶於翌日為本港帶來大驟雨及狂風雷暴。本港普遍錄得約30毫米雨量，而港島及九龍的雨量更超過50毫米。六月二十七日至二十八日一道廣闊低壓槽及高空擾動影響廣東沿岸，並為本港帶來驟雨及雷暴。六月二十八日凌晨有大驟雨，多處地區錄得約30毫米雨量，而大埔的雨量更超過50毫米。由於廣闊低壓槽在廣東沿岸徘徊，六月最後兩日本港天氣仍然大致多雲，間中有大驟雨及雷暴，六月二十九日九龍東及沙田錄得約20毫米雨量，六月三十日本港大部分地區錄得超過30毫米雨量，而九龍東及新界東部的雨量更超過50毫米。
