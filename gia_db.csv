EEB and power companies announce 2026 electricity tariff adjustment (with photo/video),2025-11-18 20:05,2025-11-18 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800787.htm,"âThe Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) and the two power companies announced today (November 18) the electricity tariff adjustment for next year. After negotiation with the Government, CLP Power Hong Kong Limited and Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CLP Power) will reduce their average Net Tariff by 2.6 per cent to 140.6 cents per kWh with effect from January 1, 2026, and the Hongkong Electric Company Limited (HK Electric) will lower their average Net Tariff by 2.2 per cent to 163.3 cents per kWh.

The Secretary for the Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, said at the press conference today that the Government's energy policy objectives are to ensure that the public will enjoy safe, reliable and environmentally friendly electricity supply at reasonable costs. Therefore, the Government has been diligently playing a gate-keeping role in accordance with the Scheme of Control Agreements. After rounds of negotiations, the two power companies eventually agreed to lower the average Net Tariff starting January next year. Regarding the Basic Tariff, CLP Power agreed to reduce the next year's Basic Tariff to a level lower than the projected level of Basic Tariff under its five-year Development Plan, while HK Electric's Basic Tariff remains consistent with the projected level.

Mr Tse said, ""Based on the two power companies' estimates, after the tariff adjustment, a typical three-member family household with monthly consumption of 275kWh will pay around $10 less each month compared to the approved rates for 2025.""

The CLP Power Managing Director, Mr Joseph Law, said, ""We expect the tariff reduction to help lower living expenses of households and operating costs of small and medium-sized enterprises. We also allocate $270 million from the CLP Community Energy Saving Fund to promote energy conservation and decarbonisation, support the underprivileged, and inject momentum into Hong Kong's economy. While geopolitical tensions continue to pose uncertainties to fuel prices, we remain committed to managing fuel costs through a diversified fuel mix as well as upholding prudent financial management and enhancing operational efficiency with innovative technologies in delivering reliable, environmentally responsible, and reasonably priced electricity services.""

The HK Electric Managing Director, Mr Francis Cheng, said, ""HK Electric has been committed to providing Hong Kong with a safe, reliable, and clean electricity supply over the years. Through prudent planning, we continuously replace assets that have reached or exceeded their design or useful lives, in accordance with their depreciation cycles or actual condition to ensure a stable and reliable power supply while avoiding unnecessary capital investment. In light of the increasingly severe cyberattack threats, IT systems have to be enhanced also to strengthen their resilience. These capital investments inevitably put pressure on tariffs. Notwithstanding, the relatively stable fuel prices mean the fuel clause charge will be reduced, resulting in the net electricity tariff next year lower than that in January this year.""

Mr Tse said, ""Notwithstanding a minor reduction in average net tariff next January, we encourage the general public to cultivate a green living style and select energy efficient electrical appliances for environmental protection, which will help further reduce electricity expenditure and carbon emissions, and protect the environment. The Government's Mandatory Energy Efficiency Labelling Scheme (MEELS), which covers 11 types of appliances, has fully implemented new grading standards for refrigerating appliances, washing machines and storage type electric water heaters since September 2025. The full implementation of MEELS is expected to bring an additional energy saving of about 270 million kWh per year, which is equivalent to annual electricity consumption of 80 000 typical three-member family households. The public is encouraged to visit Energy Saving Tips in Government's webpage Energy Saving for All to get to know more about ways to save energy and practice 'smart electricity consumption' together."""
Speech by STL at Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board Flagship Session (English only) (with photo),2025-11-18 20:01,2025-11-18 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800718.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board Flagship Session - Hong Kong: A Global Maritime Capital today (November 18):

Dr Moses Cheng (Chairman of the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board), distinguished industry leaders, partners, friends,

Good afternoon. It is my privilege to join you and open this flagship session hosted by the newly established Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board. The conversations these days have confirmed a powerful consensus: The global maritime industry now stands at a tipping point, and the capital for the great maritime decarbonisation is ready to flow. The critical question is, where will it find its gateway?

In today's ever-changing global maritime landscape, I stand before you with immense confidence that Hong Kong is positioning itself as Asia's Green Maritime Finance Capital Gateway. What a lengthy word but it inherits a lot of wisdom, ambitions and visions in this long phrase. We are building the bridge that connects the vast global pools of green capital with the multi-trillion-dollar investment opportunities in sustainable shipping. I think sustainability is the keyword.

This is not an aspiration; it is a strategic evolution of our core strengths. Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong offers a unique advantage and convergence: a unique bilingual common law system that keeps pace with international maritime regulatory practices, the world's freest economy with seamless flow of capital, as well as a top-notch maritime cluster comprised of over 1 200 companies, many of which actually benefit from the series of tax concessionary measures that Hong Kong has provided by legal mandate over the years. This is the stable, trusted platform to de-risk and deploy capital into one of the world's most critical energy transitions. Our strategic positioning is propelled by three main drivers.

First, we have the proven financial firepower and a complete maritime ecosystem necessary to power this transition. Hong Kong's position as Asia's leading green finance hub is undisputable. Last year, our green and sustainable debt market surpassed US$84 billion, with bonds alone capturing 45 per cent of the regional market. We are also pioneering the green finance technology itself, from launching the world's first government-issued tokenised green bond to the first multi-currency digital bond. I do not know whether you have the opportunity to listen to the Financial Secretary's speech at the ICS (International Chamber of Shipping) open summit yesterday. He made three important key observations about the growth areas in China, Asia and this part of the region including Hong Kong where we are propelling. The figures that I mentioned just now provide clear evidence for the global shipping community with the sophisticated, diverse capital required for the heavy upfront investments in green vessels, fuel infrastructure and clean energy ports. Yet, financial depth alone is not enough. What truly sets Hong Kong apart is our complete, integrated maritime ecosystem - a one-stop shop for the entire industry. This comprehensive ecosystem provides unparalleled support, where you will find, for example, 11 of the 12 International Group P&I (protection and indemnity) clubs and eight of the world's top 10 ship finance bookrunners for your insurance and capital needs. For resolving maritime disputes, we are recognised by the Baltic International Maritime Council as one of the world's four designated arbitration venues. We did not get such recognition yesterday, but we achieved that a few years ago. I would also like to emphasise, for operational support, five of the top 10 global ship managers are here, with three headquartered in our city. All this evidence and data imply that your entire network of partners, financiers, and peers is concentrated here, providing the collaborative muscle to power through the complex challenges of the green transition. I cannot agree more; the peer, the companion, the enjoyment of food and wine, and the companionship of Hong Kong all make doing business so friendly and enjoyable in Hong Kong.

Second, we are establishing Hong Kong into a green fuel bunkering and trading hub to create the bankable assets that capital seeks. Pioneering investments carry higher costs, and the full benefit of green investments may not be realised due to, for example, the low availability of green fuels. Our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering, with its five core strengths and strategies and 10 concrete actions, provides exactly a definitive roadmap to propel the green fuel bunkering and trading development in Hong Kong. Leveraging our unparalleled access to the Chinese Mainland's green fuel production, we are already delivering tangible, quick results from setting the national record for the largest single delivery of biodiesel at a Chinese port, to successfully transition into regularised LNG (liquefied natural gas) bunkering in Hong Kong waters. In a way, we are starting late but catching up fast. Our focus now is on the next generation of fuels. We are pioneering the future with methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen. To accelerate this, we secured a duty exemption for methanol through legislation and will commence feasibility studies for ammonia and hydrogen bunkering soon this year. We recognise the first-mover disadvantage of high initial costs, and that is precisely why we launched the Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering Incentive Scheme in order to help our partners to de-risk and reward pioneering companies. Like different industries, our shipping partners also like recognition and rewards. Though it may be small to the big businesses, it really serves as a symbolism and demonstration of how much care and attention we show to the industry. Next year, we will introduce legislation for a half-rate profits tax concession for the eligible commodity traders including those who trade in green maritime fuels. Coupled with our ongoing matchmaking events that connect Chinese Mainland enterprises with global end-users, we are not just building a fuel hub; we are creating the entire landscape and liquid marketplace required to finance and sustain the global fleet's transition. And here my keyword will be marketplace. When we talk about food and wine, companion and peer, we need to have a marketplace. We should not say platform, working group or task force; we need to use marketplace in order to be more lively and enjoyable.

Third, we are de-risking the industry's green capital investment by providing unwavering regulatory certainty and forging strategic global partnerships. Over the past few days, there have been closed door and open-door discussions about the disruption and delay of the IMO (International Maritime Organization) schedule. But I think rule-based aside, this will not hinder Hong Kong's determination to create a buoyant and dynamic ecosystem to help forge our journey towards green transformation. While international timelines may shift, Hong Kong offers decisive clarity. At home, we are proactively building comprehensive regulatory frameworks - governing everything from green fuel bunkering, with our Codes of Practice for LNG and Methanol and a mandate for the use of mass flow meters for methanol bunkering by 2026. I found it amazing that this tool and standard are just so important for ensuring fairness and transparency in green fuel bunkering. We will be introducing this mandate for mass flow metres for methanol bunkering by 2026 to the sustainable end-of-life recycling of vessels via the recent enactment of the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships into the local legislation, and we will do this well before the market peaks, with a view to providing investors the necessary confidence and certainty to commit for tomorrow. While the international timeline seems to delay a little bit, we have to act fast and act now for the preparation tomorrow. Concurrently, we are building the infrastructure of international collaboration. As the Chief Executive announced yesterday, we have announced the first batch of partner ports and established partner ports relationships with Guangxi port and Dalian port on the Chinese Mainland, as well as San Antonio Port of Chile. We will continue to identify partner ports for developing green shipping corridors - dedicated routes where vessels can achieve low or zero-carbon operations through co-ordinated green port services and fuel availability. For investors, these corridors could be strategic de-risking instruments that concentrate green capital, create scalable access and testbeds for zero-carbon operations, and, most importantly, drive down first-mover costs through knowledge and technological exchanges, ensuring today's pioneering investments become tomorrow's commercial success.

Ladies and gentlemen, the course is charted, the consensus is clear, and the capital is ready. In Hong Kong, if not other places. In Hong Kong, you can find more than just a port or a financial centre; you can find your strategic gateway for your green maritime finance capital, with our financial firepower to fund your ambitions, physical bunkering and trading hubs to power your vessels, and the regulatory certainty and global partnerships and a marketplace to de-risk your investments. The tides of change are not a threat to be weathered, but a powerful current we can harness together. We have the strategy, the ecosystem, and the unwavering commitment to succeed. So let me conclude with a clear invitation: Do not just navigate this transition - lead it from Hong Kong. Anchor your sustainable future here, and let us work in partnership to steer the global maritime industry towards a more prosperous and resilient zero-carbon future. Thank you very much."
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-18 19:35,2025-11-18 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800785.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 18),the CHP has recorded one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
--------------------------

  The case involves a 26-year-old male living alone in Yau Tsim Mong District. Initial investigation revealed that during his solo trip to India between November 5 and 15, he developed a fever and joint pain on November 8 and 9 respectively. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department at Kwong Wah Hospital yesterday (November 17) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. His blood sample tested positive for chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. He is currently in stable condition.

  Since the patient stayed in India during his incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected overseas. The case is classified as imported. The CHP will report the case to the relevant health authority.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 64 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, the recent outbreak of CF has shown a sustained downward trend. There were 48 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (November 9 to 15), showing a further decrease compared to the previous week (November 2 to 8), which reported 107 cases. The cases last week were mainly reported in Jiangmen (14 cases) and Shenzhen (12 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

Regarding the recently announced local case involving a 68-year-old female who lives in Tung Hei Court in Shau Kei Wan, the CHP is still conducting genome analysis.

The CHP urged the residents living in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 15. The CHP collaborated with the Eastern District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention and questionnaire surveys to about 3 000 households in the affected areas in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

  As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 4 900 individuals through the health consultation booth on 2/F, Hing Tung Shopping Centre in Shau Kei Wan, its inquiry hotline (2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits at Tung Hei Court. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past three days. Four individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests, and all testednegative for the chikungunya virus. Given the significant decrease in the number of citizens visiting the health consultation booth recently and all individuals who underwent blood tests at the booth concerned have negative results, the operating hours of the booth will be adjusted starting tomorrow (November 19) based on actual needs. Please refer to the CHP'swebpagefor the actual operating hours of the health consultation booth.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-18 19:35,2025-11-18 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800784.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月十八日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名26歲男子，獨居於油尖旺區。初步調查顯示，他於十一月五日至十五日獨自到訪印度期間，先後出現發燒和關節痛（十一月八日和九日），昨日（十一月十七日）到廣華醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，目前情況穩定。

由於病人在潛伏期內身處印度，中心認為他是在海外受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會把個案通報當地衞生部門。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得64宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，近期基孔肯雅熱疫情呈持續下降趨勢。過去一周（十一月九日至十五日）廣東省新增48宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較對上一周（十一月二日至八日）的107宗進一步回落。上周個案主要分布在江門市（14宗）和深圳市（12宗）。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

就早前公布一宗涉及一名住在筲箕灣東熹苑的68歲女子的本地個案，中心仍在對該病人的病毒基因進行分析工作。

中心呼籲該名患者居所一帶居民，如於十月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員和東區關愛隊已向東熹苑一帶受影響地區約3 000個單位派發有關預防基孔肯雅熱的資料單張及問卷，提醒居民留意有否相關病徵和注意家居的環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過設於筲箕灣興東商場二樓的醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於東熹苑進行上門探訪，為逾4 900名市民進行評估，過去三日未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。中心已為四名早前出現輕微病徵的市民進行抽血檢查，全部對基孔肯雅病毒的檢測為陰性。鑑於近日前往醫護站的市民明顯減少，加上全部於上述醫護站接受抽血檢查的人士結果均為陰性，明日（十一月十九日）起，醫護站的運作時間會因應實際需要而調整，確實時間請參閱中心網站。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

Hong Kong's NextGen Logistician Awards 2025 presentation ceremony held to recognise outstanding young logistics talent (with photo),2025-11-18 19:33,2025-11-18 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800519.htm,"  The presentation ceremony of Hong Kong's NextGen Logistician Awards 2025 was held today (November 18) during the Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference 2025, recognising young talent in the logistics industry who have made significant achievements and shown remarkable potential in innovative, high-end, smart and green logistics.

  The Awards is an annual event for the logistics industry advocated by the Transport and Logistics Bureau in the Action Plan on Modern Logistics Development, and is co-organised by various sectors of Hong Kong's logistics trade with the support of the Hong Kong Logistics Development Council (LOGSCOUNCIL). It aims to commend outstanding young logisticians and, through the success stories of the award winners, introduce new development directions of modern logistics to the public with a view to attracting more young people to join the industry to propel its continual growth. Following the success of its inauguration in 2024, the Awards returned in its second edition this year.

  Speaking at the ceremony, the Under Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Mr Liu Chun-san, said that he was glad to see the awardees this year representing a wide range of sectors, including e-commerce fulfilment, engineering, technological innovation, container terminal operation and cargo handling.

​香港海關開展第二階段的完稅標籤制度先導計劃（附圖）,2025-11-18 19:32,2025-11-18 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800741.htm,"香港海關十月六日開展為期三個月的完稅標籤制度先導計劃於早前完成第一階段的測試，並於昨日（十一月十七日）展開第二階段先導計劃。

第一階段的測試，旨在於實際操作環境中模擬完稅標籤制度的運作流程及測試相關技術，為下一階段測試做好準備。在第一階段測試中，海關除了於海關課稅室為旅客帶入或以貨件進口香港的完稅香煙附貼試行完稅標籤外，亦借用本地香煙生產商的設備於實際操作環境中進行技術測試，包括構建電腦模組測試數據系統、於生產過程中附貼試行完稅標籤及將有關產品暫存保稅倉，並於完稅後推出零售市場的整個物流鏈流程。

綜合第一階段的測試結果及透過問卷收集的意見，顯示公眾對完稅標籤的設計均傾向正面，而生產過程中附貼標籤的成功率亦超過百分之九十九。

在第二階段的先導計劃中，海關會使用經優化的試行完稅標籤，其設計採用更輕薄的紙質及印上雷射圖案的防偽技術，已附貼標籤的香煙將視乎完稅情況，陸續推出全港的零售點出售，讓更多市民接觸到試行完稅標籤。

另一方面，第二階段的先導計劃亦會拓展至更多邊境口岸的海關課稅室，包括羅湖、香園圍及廣深港高速鐵路西九龍站，為旅客攜帶超過免稅限額的香煙在完稅後附貼試行完稅標籤。

海關將繼續推廣完稅標籤制度，並積極與煙草業界（包括香煙入口商）進行溝通，包括邀請他們參與第二階段的先導計劃。海關稍後將舉行講解會向業界提供標籤附貼流程資料及派發試行完稅標籤樣本作參考，並會透過問卷形式收集業界的意見，期望有關計劃能夠有助於完善完稅標籤制度的規劃，有效區分已完稅和未完稅香煙，打擊「白牌煙」。

針對市面有商販以低於煙草稅的價格銷售懷疑未完稅香煙，海關會繼續加強巡查並密切留意市場的最新情況，如發現任何形式的私煙買賣活動，必定會果斷執法。

根據新修訂《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），售價低於煙草稅的煙支須證明已課稅，否則會被推定為未完稅香煙。

海關呼籲各零售商切勿售賣來歷不明的香煙，對來貨價低於煙草稅的香煙，必須提高警覺，以避免刑事責任。海關提醒零售商和市民，根據《條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。"
Hong Kong Customs commences second phase of Pilot Run for Duty Stamp System (with photos),2025-11-18 19:32,2025-11-18 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800743.htm,"The first phase of the three-month Pilot Run for the Duty Stamp System launched by Hong Kong Customs on October 6 was completed recently and entered into the second phase starting yesterday (November 17).

The first phase of the Pilot Run, aimed to simulate the operational procedures of the Duty Stamp System in a real setting for testing related technologies and getting prepared for the next phase of testing. During the first phase, Customs not only affixed trial duty stamps to duty-paid cigarettes brought into Hong Kong by travellers or imported via small shipments at the Duty Collection Offices, but also conducted technical tests in actual operational environments using equipment from local cigarette manufacturers. This included building a computer module for testing the data system, affixing trial duty stamps during the production process, the storage of products in bonded warehouses after production, and releasing them to the retail market after duty payment, covering the entire logistics chain.

The test results of the first phase and opinions collected through questionnaires reflected that the general public indicated a positive attitude towards the design of the duty stamp and a success rate of over 99 per cent in the affixation of stamps during production was achieved.

In the second phase of the Pilot Run, Customs will use enhanced trial duty stamps which adopt thinner paper and a hologram as an anti-counterfeiting feature in the design. Cigarettes affixed with stamps, depending on their status of duty payment, will be available at retail outlets across all districts successively, allowing more members of the public access to the trial duty stamps.

Meanwhile, the second phase of the Pilot Run will be extended to cover more Duty Collection Offices at various control points, including Lo Wu, Heung Yuen Wai, and the West Kowloon Station of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, for affixing trial duty stamps to cigarettes carried by travellers exceeding the duty free concession after payment of duties.

  Customs will continue to promote the Duty Stamp System and actively communicate with the tobacco industry (including cigarette importers), as well as invite them to participate in the second phase of the Pilot Run. Customs will hold briefing sessions to provide more information on the duty stamp affixing procedures information, and distribute trial duty stamp samples for reference. Customs will also collect feedback from the industry through questionnaires with a view to enhancing the planning of the Duty Stamp System and thus achieve the ultimate goal of effective distinguishment of duty-paid cigarettes from duty-not-paid ones, and to combat the ""cheap whites"".

In response to the presence of sales outlets selling suspected duty-not-paid cigarettes below tobacco duty on the market, Customs will continue to step up patrol operations and closely monitor the latest market situation. Customs will take decisive enforcement action if any form of illicit cigarette trading activities is found.

Under the amended Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO), cigarettes sold at a price lower than the tobacco duty must be proven to be duty-paid, otherwise the cigarettes are presumed to be duty-not-paid.

Customs appeals to retailers not to sell cigarettes from unknown sources. Retailers must stay vigilant against cigarettes with wholesale prices lower than the tobacco duty in order to avoid criminal liability. Customs reminds retailers and members of the public that under the DCO, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years."
CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another severe paediatric influenza infection case reported,2025-11-18 19:32,2025-11-18 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800786.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 18) recorded a severe paediatric influenza infection case. The CHP reiterated its appeal to urge schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves a 14-year-old boy with underlying illness. He developed a convulsion on November 14 and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of United Christian Hospital, where was admitted. Yesterday (November 17), he developed dizziness, a fever and cough with sputum. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with pneumonia and shock. He is currently in serious condition.

The boy had not yet received the 2025/26 SIV. His household contacts are currently asymptomatic and no influenza outbreaks have been reported at his school recently.

Including the abovementioned case, there have been 19 severe influenza cases involving children so far this summer influenza season, including two fatal cases. The affected children aged 11 months to 17 years. Ten cases have been recorded since the launch of this year's SIV Programmes, with only one having received this year's SIV four days prior to the onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, in other words, these severe influenza cases are not protected by the vaccine.

""According to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity began to decline in the last week of October. However, it remains at a relatively high level. As the weather turns cooler, influenza activity may still fluctuate. Moreover, a winter influenza season may occur early next year. Therefore, I once again urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV to do so promptly. Compared to the winter influenza season earlier this year, there have been more severe paediatric influenza infection cases this season. Currently, among children aged below 18 years, the coverage rate of children aged 6 months to under 2 years is relatively low, at nearly 16 per cent only. Parents should not hesitate and should contact their family doctors as soon as possible to arrange for their children, as well as themselves and other family members, to receive the SIV,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

He also reminded members of the public that, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."

Also attending the meeting were the Chairman of the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board (HKMPDB), Dr Moses Cheng, and the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers (HKFI), Ms Selina Lau.

Ms Chan welcomed the visit of leaders of the international marine insurance sector to Hong Kong. She said that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government attaches great importance to maintaining close ties with the global maritime industry and actively participates in meetings and exchange activities of the IUMI to keep abreast of the latest developments in the global shipping and marine insurance fields. Over the years, the IUMI has been committed to promoting the professional development and international standards of the global marine insurance industry, and has maintained good collaboration with the industry in Hong Kong. The IUMI established its first Asian hub in Hong Kong in 2016 to enhance support for marine insurance in the Asian region.

She added that following the official establishment of the Hong Kong Shipowners Mutual Assurance Association at the World Maritime Merchants Forum 2025 Government Summit yesterday (November 17), she was pleased to note that the HKMPDB and the IUMI has further signed a Memorandum of Understanding on talent training for the marine insurance industry at an event co-organised by the IUMI and the HKFI during HKMW 2025 today. This will help enhance the industry's alignment with international standards, further elevate Hong Kong's international status in the field of high value-added maritime services, and promote the development of high value-added maritime professional training. In addition, the Maritime Services Traineeship Scheme - Marine Insurance under the Maritime and Aviation Training Fund has been launched to encourage insurance companies and insurance broker companies engaged in marine insurance business to provide internship opportunities for those aspiring to pursue a career in marine insurance.

She added that 11 out of the 12 member associations of the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Clubs provide services in Hong Kong, evidencing the vibrancy and internationalisation of Hong Kong's marine insurance development. Hong Kong's advantages, including the ""one country, two systems"" principle, a bilingual common law system, a free economy and a simple and low tax regime, make it an ideal city for global maritime service enterprises to set up their businesses and provide quality maritime services for global shipping enterprises. The HKSAR Government will further promote the development of high value-added maritime services with a view to developing Hong Kong into a leading international maritime centre."

醫務衞生局局長和教育局局長會見傳媒談籌備新醫學院最新進度的答問內容（附短片）,2025-11-18 18:54,2025-11-18 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800725.htm,"醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士今日（十一月十八日）會見傳媒公布籌備新醫學院的最新進度。以下是盧寵茂教授和蔡若蓮博士會見傳媒的答問內容：

記者：兩條問題，首先是早前盧局長你提到，三間申請大學的財務安排的差異都比較大，可否談談最終提交的計劃書中，三間的分別在哪裏？相比其他兩間，科大比較欠缺一些醫護、醫療專科的課程，它最終勝出是否因為財務安排優勝？政府的資助最後會有多少？第二方面，剛才提到清水灣會建醫學院綜合大樓，想弄清楚第三間醫學院最終會落戶清水灣？有沒有牛潭尾用地的情況？如不在牛潭尾發展，會否影響整個北都計劃？亦想問工作組在票數上，究竟三間的票數是怎樣？

醫務衞生局局長：多謝這個問題。首先，整個評核不會用單一標準。我一開始已經說了，我們有十個準則，財務安排是其中一個。科技大學的方案，我們看到有一些很優秀的地方，特別是它的策略定位是非常清晰，而它的全球視野是相當廣闊，我們覺得它在競爭力，以至吸引力方面，對未來招聘教授人手，以至學生方面，都會有一定優勢。加上它在科研方面的優勢，而它的定位是融合醫療與科研於一體。最後，它的財務安排亦能配合《財政預算案》中提出，用一個配對形式來提供資助籌建這間新醫學院，這包括它在其清水灣院校內自己興建一幢醫學院的綜合大樓，以至在其他方面的營運過程，他們都提出配對安排。它現時的財務方案，在比率上，與政府出的資金，在未來25年間，包括一些基建項目，以至營運資金，與政府是相約的，差不多是一與一的比例。這符合政府在財政預算方面提出的配對政策，而我們亦看到它在財政方面的實力是比較雄厚。詳細的情況，科技大學很快會向大家安排一個介紹會，向大家介紹其方案。

至於校舍，牛潭尾作爲醫學院，以至未來教學醫院的位置，現時的政策是沒有改變的，我們的目標仍然是以牛潭尾作爲我們未來新醫學院，以至教學醫院的校舍。但是，在這校舍未建成之前，科技大學提出了一個過渡期的校舍，以及教學培訓醫院的方案。其中，醫學院選址在它的清水灣校園內，以其現有的一些教學資源，特別是它會加建一幢醫學院的綜合大樓在清水灣校園中，由它自己全資負責，作為由二○二八年開始，如果招收第一批學生，直到牛潭尾醫學院的新校舍建好之前的教學用途。

至於票數，其實工作組不是用一個這麽簡單「數票」方法，因爲我們都強調，整個過程要專業、全面、綜合，亦很公正地評核，基於十個標準，每一個標準都有自己的強項，我們沒有就每一個標準用一個「打分制」，但最終我們達至一個大多數支持科技大學的建議書。

記者：整體資助額為多少？

醫務衞生局局長：我們想等科技大學向大家詳細公布後，再進一步公布。詳細的財政安排會在諒解備忘錄中詳列。不過，現在給大家知道的是，我們是以一個配對模式，政府的出資是會與科技大學相約。

記者：關於招生學額，想問其實50位首階段招生的學生，非本地生的比例有多少？第二條問題，之前提及過第三間醫學院其實與另外兩間大學有錯位發展，以科大目前的發展計劃，其實跟另外兩間大學有何不同？

教育局局長：就非本地招生學額（比例），UGC（大學教育資助委員會）現時（已放寬）對非本地學生設有以超額收生形式（相當於本地學額數目）百分之五十的上限，（供新醫學院參照）。醫學教育是特殊人力規劃的學科，我們會密切留意收生情況，以及本地生與非本地生的比例。就錯位發展，最基本他們（就讀學生）是second degree entry，即第二學位入學。醫學教學方面，我請盧局長補充。

醫務衞生局局長：沒錯，錯位發展是非常重要的，我們這次在籌建第三間醫學院時，一開始已經提出，亦要求所有建議書都要做到這一點。原因是我們有兩所非常優秀的醫學院──港大醫學院和中大醫學院，我們希望在建立第三間醫學院的時候真正做到良性競爭，而不是惡性競爭，其中包括新醫學院本身的策略定位。剛才我提到，它是以結合醫療服務和科研，希望培養出一些醫生的科學家。在招收學生方面，它是第二學位課程，即是所有畢業生並不是中學畢業生，這會擴大我們招攬人才到香港讀醫。全世界最知名的大學，它們的第一學位本科的畢業生，特別是修讀與生物醫學學科有關的，都是我們招攬人才的其中一個途徑。而在招聘教職員、教授方面，我們強調它會有多途徑招聘，特別是向全世界招攬人才，這方面我們看到科技大學過往有很多優勢。

另外，在科研方面我們亦看到科技大學的科研成果，雖然它現時未有醫療方面的教學，但它在生命科學方面、人工智能、大數據方面都有很多強項，科技大學在人工智能以至大數據，或在某些生命科學，例如腦神經科學的發展，亦有相當高的成就，我們希望能夠在這方面幫助它，醫學院的發展會有助它將這些優勢應用至生命醫學臨床方面。

記者：做這個決定的時候，當中有沒有分歧？剛才說到不是按「打分制」或者不是簡單用票數去決定，但其實當中專家之間會不會有分歧？可能有其他選擇？可否交代一下其實在決定、決策過程有沒有爭議？另外，關於收生安排，說到有機會收到非本地生，其實早前說過不會為非本地生定居港年期，即居港工作年期，但外界有聲音擔心有些學生如果是非本地生，他們畢業後未必懂得說廣東話，或者可能跟病人交流上有些阻礙，推出課程之後會不會要求畢業生要懂得說廣東話？

教育局局長：就非本地生收生要求或醫學院課程，剛才盧醫生已提到，院校除培育醫療人才，同時也進行科研。來港的非本地生亦明白，我們希望培養能服務香港醫療系統，以及貢獻香港醫學教育創新（的人才），因此在語言方面，我相信大學安排課程時會考慮這一點。至於畢業生留港，現時無論甚麼學科，我們均鼓勵非本地學生留港工作，因此我們設有IANG計劃，即非本地畢業生留港／回港就業安排，提供24個月簽證，這安排亦適用於這個新學科。

醫務衞生局局長：我補充一下，我在醫學院工作相當長的時間，其實醫學教育有其獨特地方，因爲醫學很多時我們要面對病人，所以語言的溝通能力絕對是有需要的。我們明白香港大部分人說廣東話，我們亦要知道也有很多人說其他語言，包括普通話、英文，特別是以香港這麽國際化的城市，其實在很多方面我都希望我們的專業人員，特別是醫療人員能夠做到兩文三語。現有兩間醫學院在收生方面對語言都有一個要求，而第三間醫學院亦會在這方面作出一些適應，在入學時可能會有一定的要求，在課程內亦會有針對語言溝通能力，因爲溝通其實在醫學課程中是一個重要的元素。

至於你提到在評審過程中專家組有沒有分歧，我再次重申強調，三間大學提出的方案都是非常精細，也有很多創新的地方，有些我們也未曾想過。不只是專家有分歧，我自己也曾經「腦交戰」。在看三間大學提出的方案時，特別是十個準則，一定會出現某些準則是A大學優勝，有些是B大學優勝，有些是C大學優勝，這是無可避免的。但通過大家討論，更加重要的是我們要跟三間大學作實際溝通，它們提出文字上的建議書，是需要進一步跟它們細化和了解實際情況，所以整個討論是基於專業和總體全面而作出最後的判斷。

記者：兩條問題，首先是早前盧局長你提到，三間申請大學的財務安排的差異都比較大，可否談談最終提交的計劃書中，三間的分別在哪裏？相比其他兩間，科大比較欠缺一些醫護、醫療專科的課程，它最終勝出是否因為財務安排優勝？政府的資助最後會有多少？第二方面，剛才提到清水灣會建醫學院綜合大樓，想弄清楚第三間醫學院最終會落戶清水灣？有沒有牛潭尾用地的情況？如不在牛潭尾發展，會否影響整個北都計劃？亦想問工作組在票數上，究竟三間的票數是怎樣？

醫務衞生局局長：多謝這個問題。首先，整個評核不會用單一標準。我一開始已經說了，我們有十個準則，財務安排是其中一個。科技大學的方案，我們看到有一些很優秀的地方，特別是它的策略定位是非常清晰，而它的全球視野是相當廣闊，我們覺得它在競爭力，以至吸引力方面，對未來招聘教授人手，以至學生方面，都會有一定優勢。加上它在科研方面的優勢，而它的定位是融合醫療與科研於一體。最後，它的財務安排亦能配合《財政預算案》中提出，用一個配對形式來提供資助籌建這間新醫學院，這包括它在其清水灣院校內自己興建一幢醫學院的綜合大樓，以至在其他方面的營運過程，他們都提出配對安排。它現時的財務方案，在比率上，與政府出的資金，在未來25年間，包括一些基建項目，以至營運資金，與政府是相約的，差不多是一與一的比例。這符合政府在財政預算方面提出的配對政策，而我們亦看到它在財政方面的實力是比較雄厚。詳細的情況，科技大學很快會向大家安排一個介紹會，向大家介紹其方案。

至於校舍，牛潭尾作爲醫學院，以至未來教學醫院的位置，現時的政策是沒有改變的，我們的目標仍然是以牛潭尾作爲我們未來新醫學院，以至教學醫院的校舍。但是，在這校舍未建成之前，科技大學提出了一個過渡期的校舍，以及教學培訓醫院的方案。其中，醫學院選址在它的清水灣校園內，以其現有的一些教學資源，特別是它會加建一幢醫學院的綜合大樓在清水灣校園中，由它自己全資負責，作為由二○二八年開始，如果招收第一批學生，直到牛潭尾醫學院的新校舍建好之前的教學用途。

至於票數，其實工作組不是用一個這麽簡單「數票」方法，因爲我們都強調，整個過程要專業、全面、綜合，亦很公正地評核，基於十個標準，每一個標準都有自己的強項，我們沒有就每一個標準用一個「打分制」，但最終我們達至一個大多數支持科技大學的建議書。

記者：整體資助額為多少？

醫務衞生局局長：我們想等科技大學向大家詳細公布後，再進一步公布。詳細的財政安排會在諒解備忘錄中詳列。不過，現在給大家知道的是，我們是以一個配對模式，政府的出資是會與科技大學相約。

記者：關於招生學額，想問其實50位首階段招生的學生，非本地生的比例有多少？第二條問題，之前提及過第三間醫學院其實與另外兩間大學有錯位發展，以科大目前的發展計劃，其實跟另外兩間大學有何不同？

教育局局長：就非本地招生學額（比例），UGC（大學教育資助委員會）現時（已放寬）對非本地學生設有以超額收生形式（相當於本地學額數目）百分之五十的上限，（供新醫學院參照）。醫學教育是特殊人力規劃的學科，我們會密切留意收生情況，以及本地生與非本地生的比例。就錯位發展，最基本他們（就讀學生）是second degree entry，即第二學位入學。醫學教學方面，我請盧局長補充。

醫務衞生局局長：沒錯，錯位發展是非常重要的，我們這次在籌建第三間醫學院時，一開始已經提出，亦要求所有建議書都要做到這一點。原因是我們有兩所非常優秀的醫學院──港大醫學院和中大醫學院，我們希望在建立第三間醫學院的時候真正做到良性競爭，而不是惡性競爭，其中包括新醫學院本身的策略定位。剛才我提到，它是以結合醫療服務和科研，希望培養出一些醫生的科學家。在招收學生方面，它是第二學位課程，即是所有畢業生並不是中學畢業生，這會擴大我們招攬人才到香港讀醫。全世界最知名的大學，它們的第一學位本科的畢業生，特別是修讀與生物醫學學科有關的，都是我們招攬人才的其中一個途徑。而在招聘教職員、教授方面，我們強調它會有多途徑招聘，特別是向全世界招攬人才，這方面我們看到科技大學過往有很多優勢。

另外，在科研方面我們亦看到科技大學的科研成果，雖然它現時未有醫療方面的教學，但它在生命科學方面、人工智能、大數據方面都有很多強項，科技大學在人工智能以至大數據，或在某些生命科學，例如腦神經科學的發展，亦有相當高的成就，我們希望能夠在這方面幫助它，醫學院的發展會有助它將這些優勢應用至生命醫學臨床方面。

記者：做這個決定的時候，當中有沒有分歧？剛才說到不是按「打分制」或者不是簡單用票數去決定，但其實當中專家之間會不會有分歧？可能有其他選擇？可否交代一下其實在決定、決策過程有沒有爭議？另外，關於收生安排，說到有機會收到非本地生，其實早前說過不會為非本地生定居港年期，即居港工作年期，但外界有聲音擔心有些學生如果是非本地生，他們畢業後未必懂得說廣東話，或者可能跟病人交流上有些阻礙，推出課程之後會不會要求畢業生要懂得說廣東話？

教育局局長：就非本地生收生要求或醫學院課程，剛才盧醫生已提到，院校除培育醫療人才，同時也進行科研。來港的非本地生亦明白，我們希望培養能服務香港醫療系統，以及貢獻香港醫學教育創新（的人才），因此在語言方面，我相信大學安排課程時會考慮這一點。至於畢業生留港，現時無論甚麼學科，我們均鼓勵非本地學生留港工作，因此我們設有IANG計劃，即非本地畢業生留港／回港就業安排，提供24個月簽證，這安排亦適用於這個新學科。

醫務衞生局局長：我補充一下，我在醫學院工作相當長的時間，其實醫學教育有其獨特地方，因爲醫學很多時我們要面對病人，所以語言的溝通能力絕對是有需要的。我們明白香港大部分人說廣東話，我們亦要知道也有很多人說其他語言，包括普通話、英文，特別是以香港這麽國際化的城市，其實在很多方面我都希望我們的專業人員，特別是醫療人員能夠做到兩文三語。現有兩間醫學院在收生方面對語言都有一個要求，而第三間醫學院亦會在這方面作出一些適應，在入學時可能會有一定的要求，在課程內亦會有針對語言溝通能力，因爲溝通其實在醫學課程中是一個重要的元素。

至於你提到在評審過程中專家組有沒有分歧，我再次重申強調，三間大學提出的方案都是非常精細，也有很多創新的地方，有些我們也未曾想過。不只是專家有分歧，我自己也曾經「腦交戰」。在看三間大學提出的方案時，特別是十個準則，一定會出現某些準則是A大學優勝，有些是B大學優勝，有些是C大學優勝，這是無可避免的。但通過大家討論，更加重要的是我們要跟三間大學作實際溝通，它們提出文字上的建議書，是需要進一步跟它們細化和了解實際情況，所以整個討論是基於專業和總體全面而作出最後的判斷。

CE meets Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economic Sciences (with photo),2025-11-18 18:45,2025-11-18 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800704.htm,"The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, today (November 18) met with two Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economic Sciences in 2001, Professor Joseph E Stiglitz and Professor Michael Spence, to exchange views on issues of mutual interest including the economy, innovation and technology (I&T), and education. The Director of the Chief Executive's Office, Ms Carol Yip, and the Head of the Chief Executive's Policy Unit, Dr Stephen Wong, also attended the meeting.

 Mr Lee welcomed Professor Stiglitz and Professor Spence to Hong Kong to attend the International Forum on China's Economy and Policy 2025 to share their insights on the economic development of the world, the country and Hong Kong. Mr Lee said he was pleased that the two scholars are optimistic about Hong Kong's development prospects, recognise its notable strengths in education and I&T, and support the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government's various strategic plans of diversifying investments, exploring emerging markets, and further deepening collaborative developments in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to seize opportunities.

 Mr Lee noted that Hong Kong enjoys the dual advantage of having national and global opportunities under the ""one country, two systems"" principle and will continue to play the roles of a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", connecting the Mainland with the world, fully integrating into the overall national development and actively dovetailing with GBA developments. As one of the core cities of the GBA, Hong Kong plays a vital role in driving regional development. The HKSAR Government will continue to collaborate with GBA cities in strengthening connectivity and enhancing the flow of people, goods, data and capital, with a view to further encouraging and supporting enterprises and talent to grasp development opportunities in the GBA.

 Mr Lee highlighted that Hong Kong is the world's freest economy, which attracts global capital and top talent, and has maintained its position of third globally and first in Asia Pacific as an international financial centre according to the newly published Global Financial Centres Index. Hong Kong is the only city worldwide that hosts five universities ranked among the world's top 100, and its ranking leapt to fourth globally in the newly published World Talent Ranking 2025, marking its highest-ever ranking. The HKSAR Government is actively accelerating the development of the Northern Metropolis University Town and promoting the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand to further develop Hong Kong into an international hub for post-secondary education and high-calibre talent.

 Noting that the world is undergoing unprecedented changes at an accelerating pace and facing global economic uncertainties, Mr Lee said that the HKSAR Government is continuously seeking new growth opportunities. Among these, the Northern Metropolis being developed at full steam serves as a new engine for Hong Kong's economic growth, boasting significant development potential and economic value. It is expected to create more jobs and enhance productivity for Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKSAR Government is vigorously promoting I&T, artificial intelligence, and related industries, while advancing the development of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, and fostering the integrated development of education, technology, and talent to develop Hong Kong into an international I&T centre with a view to contributing to the country's high-quality development."

環境及生態局與兩電公布二○二六年電費調整（附圖／短片）,2025-11-18 18:40,2025-11-18 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800721.htm,"環境及生態局聯同兩間電力公司（兩電）今日（十一月十八日）公布二○二六年的電費調整。經與政府蹉商後，中華電力有限公司和青山發電有限公司（中電）表示由二○二六年一月一日起，將會下調其平均淨電費2.6%至每度電140.6仙；而香港電燈有限公司（港燈）則表示將會下調其平均淨電費2.2%至每度電163.3仙。

環境及生態局局長謝展寰在今日的記者會表示，政府的電力供應政策是要確保市民能夠享有安全、可靠、環保及價格合理的電力供應，所以政府一直努力按《管制計劃協議》嚴格把關。經多番磋商後，兩電最終同意下調明年一月的平均淨電費。基本電費方面，中電亦同意調低於五年發展計劃下預測明年的基本電費，而港燈就與預測水平一致。

謝展寰說：「按兩電估算，電費調整後，一個每月用電量為275度的典型三人家庭的電費與二○二五年的批准電費率相比，每月會大約少付十元。」

中電總裁羅嘉進表示：「我們期望是次減價能舒緩市民生活開支和中小企營運成本，同時透過中電社區節能基金撥款二億七千萬元，全方位推動社會節能減碳、支援弱勢社群、為香港經濟注入更多動力。雖然地緣政治仍為燃料價格帶來不確定性，我們會繼續透過多元化的燃料組合，竭力控制燃料成本，同時審慎理財及利用創新科技，提升營運效率，繼續提供可靠、環保且價格合理的電力服務。」

港燈董事總經理鄭祖瀛表示：「港燈多年來一直致力為香港提供安全、可靠和潔淨的電力供應。我們透過審慎規劃，根據資產折舊周期或設備的實際狀況，持續更新部分已達到或超越設計使用壽命或可用時限的設備，在維持穩定可靠的電力供應的同時，避免不必要的資本投資。為應對日益嚴重的網絡攻擊威脅，亦需提升資訊科技系統抵禦攻擊的能力。這些資本投資難免對電費造成壓力，但由於燃料價格目前相對平穩，燃料調整費將會下調，令港燈明年的淨電費較今年一月份有所下降。」

謝展寰說：「雖然明年一月的平均淨電費會有輕微下調，但從環保的角度，我們鼓勵市民建立綠色生活的習慣和選用能源效益高的產品，可以進一步減少電費支出，亦幫助減少碳排放和保護環境。政府推行的強制性能源效益標籤計劃涵蓋十一種產品，並已於二○二五年九月起全面提升冷凍器具、洗衣機及儲水式電熱水器的能源效益要求。該強制性能源效益標籤計劃每年可額外節省約2.7億度電，相當約80 000個三人家庭的每年用電量。市民可到政府設立的『全民節能』網站參考『節能小貼士』，了解更多節約能源的方法，齊齊實踐『智慧用電』。」"

勞工及福利局局長就失業率及立法會換屆選舉便利投票措施會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-11-18 18:40,2025-11-18 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800749.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十一月十八日）下午出席「賽馬會護老導航照顧者支援計劃」研討會後，就失業率及立法會換屆選舉便利投票措施會見傳媒的談話內容：

勞工及福利局局長：很多謝大家今天來到這裏出席「賽馬會護老導航支援計劃」研討會，聽聽賽馬會支援的幫助護老照顧者的一系列計劃，取得相當好的成果。大家有什麼問題？

記者：局長，政府剛剛公布了最新八至十月的失業率，大概是3.8%，與上季數字相差不多，是否預期未來的失業率數字會有些反覆？

勞工及福利局局長：今日政府剛公布了最新八至十月的失業率。大家可看到失業率較上一季度公布的數字輕微下跌了0.1個百分點，不同界別的分項數字均有所跌幅。大家關心的餐飲業，由上一季度的6.8%下跌0.4個百分點至6.4%。我們預期隨着香港的經濟穩健發展──大家都見到最近一個季度的經濟增長相當理想──我們相信隨着香港的經濟的擴充和行業上良好的勢頭，會為就業市場帶來支撐。當然，我們也明白有部分行業仍在面對轉型期的挑戰，這方面我們也會密切留意。

記者：另外，想問問有關選舉的問題。知道政府會向長者中心和殘疾人士地區支援中心發放20,000元資助，讓他們安排專車接載選民。現時是否所有中心都申請了資助，可否透露確實申請數字及預期整體的開支數字？

勞工及福利局局長：一如二○二三年區議會一般選舉的安排，上次我們為參與的長者中心提供20,000元資助，該次參與率是90%。這次我們同樣邀請全港216間長者中心，再加上21間殘疾人士地區支援中心，總數是237間中心，我們為參與的中心提供一次性20,000元資助。我們今天剛收到回覆，全部237間長者中心和殘疾人士地區支援中心均表示會參與今次的活動，會領取20,000元津貼，方便它們為中心用家及他們的照顧者提供各種便利投票的措施，讓有權投票的人士在12月7日可以履行他們的公民權利，當日投下神聖的一票。

記者：院舍外展投票站會涵蓋哪三個地點? 實際上如何運作? 如何確保不會有人被強制去投票?

勞工及福利局局長：具體的地點和位置要留待選舉管理委員會公布，我可以告訴大家，三間分別一間在香港島、一間在九龍區、另一間在新界區──意味着香港、九龍、新界各自有一個點──當然每個點裏不只一間院舍，有些點有多間院舍。我們的原則是票站所設之處絕不影響院舍運作的地方，可能是禮堂或公用地方，都是移轉空間來的，絕對不會影響院舍運作，整個設置是為了方便住在該處的院友，以及在該處上班的人士，他們認為在該處投票會較方便，可以便利他們到這三個新設的中心點，投下他們神聖的一票。"
再錄得一宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-11-18 18:35,2025-11-18 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800729.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月十八日）接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案，再次敦促學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的14歲男童。他於十一月十四日出現抽搐，到基督教聯合醫院急症室求醫，需留院治理。他昨日（十一月十七日）出現頭暈、發燒及咳嗽帶痰。他的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發肺炎及休克，目前情況嚴重。

男童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗。他的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵，他就讀的學校近日亦沒有爆發流感。

計及上述個案，今個夏季流感季節至今已錄得19宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括兩宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎11個月至17歲。若單單計算在本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃展開後錄得的10宗個案，只有一人曾在發病前四天接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。然而接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，換言之，這些嚴重個案的兒童都未能受到疫苗保護。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然最新的監測數據顯示，流感活躍程度在十月最後一周開始回落，但仍然處於較高水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除流感活躍程度仍可能會有反覆，加上明年初或會出現冬季流感季節，因此我再次呼籲所有年滿6個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動。對比今年初冬季流感季節，今季兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案較多。目前，18歲以下兒童中，6個月至2歲以下兒童的覆蓋率相對偏低，只有近16%，希望各位家長不要遲疑，請盡快聯絡自己家庭醫生為子女，以至自己和其他家人安排接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

數字辦獲頒客戶服務獎。由數字辦營運的1823聯絡中心提供24小時客戶服務，去年運用人工智能技術處理了755萬宗個案，並在各項服務指標取得驕人成績。1823積極引入創新科技，進一步優化處理流程；其團隊時刻秉持專業有禮、高效的服務精神，表現出色。

"Ombudsman commends government departments, public organisations, professional teams and public officers for efforts to foster administrative innovation and good governance and calls on public to vote in Legislative Council General Election (with photos)",2025-11-18 18:30,2025-11-18 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800532.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

  At the 28th Presentation Ceremony of The Ombudsman’s Awards today (November 18), the Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, presented the Gold, Silver and Bronze Awards for Public Organisations to the Housing Department (HD), the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), and the Correctional Services Department (CSD), respectively. He also honoured the Transport Department (TD) with the Award on Mediation, the Drainage Services Department (DSD) with the Information Technology Application and Creativity Award, and the Digital Policy Office (DPO) with the Customer Services Award. Additionally, 10 teams were recognised with the Team Awards, and 80 public officers received the Individual Awards.

  Addressing the ceremony, Mr Chan shared the Office of The Ombudsman’s record-breaking accomplishments across all three strategic focuses he introduced last year, and extended his sincere appreciation to all relevant government departments and public organisations for their active co-operation and collaboration. This year, following the completion of several direct investigation operations into livelihood issues, which have drawn widespread public concern and significant attention from the Government, the Office is poised to surpass last year’s achievements. Furthermore, it will actively leverage the Hong Kong International Ombudsman Academy to foster innovation and drive positive changes in public administration, advocate the concept of “maladministration prevention”, and continue to strengthen ties and exchanges with international ombudsman bodies. These initiatives aim to showcase the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)’s distinctive advantage of having strong support from the motherland and close connection with the world while telling good stories of Hong Kong.

  The HD received the Gold Award this year. Despite its heavy workload in handling public rental housing applications, tenancy matters and estate management, the HD has been earnest in responding to the Office’s inquiries. Its efficient staff have contributed a lot to many successful mediation cases, demonstrating a strong commitment to service. The HD has shown particular concern for cases involving the elderly and people in need, working closely with the Office to resolve public concerns promptly and effectively. These efforts reflect its people-oriented approach and unwavering commitment to enhancing public administration.

  The FEHD was recognised for its outstanding performance in food safety, environmental hygiene and public health. It responds promptly to public complaints and actively implements the Office’s recommendations for improvement. The FEHD also takes the initiative to participate in the Office’s mediation efforts, striving to resolve public complaints more swiftly and effectively. Moreover, it has embraced innovative technologies to enhance service efficiency, illustrating a positive and forward-looking service mindset.

  The CSD has proactively introduced innovative initiatives, including a chatbot and the Approved Hand-in Articles e-Ordering Service, to enhance penal management and convenience for the public. It also offers a diverse range of rehabilitation and education programmes to support persons in custody and rehabilitated individuals in reintegrating into society. The CSD adopts a proactive and positive approach to complaint handling, delivering comprehensive and timely responses, which is commendable.

  The TD, recipient of the Award on Mediation this year, resolved 74 cases by mediation in 2024-25. Its staff responded promptly and communicated clearly, exemplifying a balanced approach that is lawful, practical and empathetic throughout the mediation process. Such practices led to satisfactory resolutions and earned the TD high praise from the Office for its exemplary performance in promoting mediation.

  The DSD was honoured with the Information Technology Application and Creativity Award for its dedicated in-house development of smart drainage systems to address challenges posed by extreme weather. Among its notable achievements, the Mosaic Model Map effectively predicts the flood risks of all districts throughout the territory, thereby enhancing emergency response capabilities. The system was recognised at the 50th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva this year, underscoring the DSD’s excellence in technology application and creativity.

  The DPO received the Customer Services Award. Operated by the DPO, the 1823 Contact Centre provides 24-hour customer service. Last year, it processed 7.55 million cases using artificial intelligence and excelled itself across all key performance indicators. 1823 has actively adopted innovative technologies to further streamline service workflows and is committed to delivering professional, courteous and efficient service at all times.

  This year, the Office introduced a new Team Award to not only recognise professional teams that have demonstrated excellence in enhancing public administration but also foster stronger connection and team spirit. A total of 10 teams received the Team Awards, including three involving interdepartmental collaboration. In addition, the Individual Awards were presented to 80 distinguished public officers. At the ceremony, Mr Chan praised the awardees, saying, “I am very pleased to see more public officers being commended. This is both a testament to their efforts and contributions and a showcase for continuous progress in public services.”

  In his final remarks, Mr Chan underscored the significance of the eighth Legislative Council General Election, noting its pivotal role in supporting the HKSAR Government’s actions in policy formulation and implementation and driving economic development and improvement of people’s livelihood. He stressed that as the independent watchdog, the Ombudsman is obliged to communicate an important message to 106 departments and organisations subject to the Office’s jurisdiction: Public officers, as the backbone of the governance team, should set an example and cast votes in the elections to fulfil their civic responsibility. The Ombudsman and all his staff fully support the election. He urged all members of the public to support the election wholeheartedly and all voters to vote on December 7. He also wished that every colleague present would motivate their families and friends to fulfil their civic responsibility by casting a precious vote for the HKSAR’s good governance, economic vibrancy and public well-being, as well as the full implementation of the principle of “patriots administering Hong Kong”. Mr Chan expressed his sincere appreciation to all winning organisations and public officers for their united efforts in advancing the quality of public administration.

李家超歡迎Joseph E Stiglitz教授和Michael Spence教授來港出席「中國經濟運行與政策」國際論壇2025，分享對環球、國家和香港經濟發展的見解。李家超表示，很高興兩位學者對香港的發展前景感到樂觀，認同香港在教育和創科等領域擁有顯著優勢，並支持特區政府提出的不同策略部署，包括分散投資和拓展新興市場，同時深化粵港澳大灣區協同發展，把握好大灣區的發展機遇。

李家超說，香港在「一國兩制」下擁有國家機遇和國際機遇的雙重疊加優勢，會繼續發揮內聯外通的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」角色，全面融入國家發展大局，主動對接粵港澳大灣區建設。香港是粵港澳大灣區中心城市和區域發展核心引擎之一，特區政府會繼續深化與大灣區不同城市互聯互通，全力提升人流、物流、數據流、資金流，進一步鼓勵和支持企業和人才把握大灣區的發展機遇。

李家超表示，香港是全球最自由經濟體，匯聚全球資金與優秀人才，在最新公布的《全球金融中心指數》報告中，繼續位居全球第三、亞太區第一。香港同時是全球唯一擁有五間百強大學的城市，在最新公布的《2025年世界人才排名》中，香港排名升至全球第四，是歷來最高排名。特區政府正積極建設北部都會區大學城和推廣「留學香港」品牌，進一步發展香港成為國際專上教育樞紐和國際高端人才集聚高地。

李家超說，當前世界百年變局加速演進，面對全球經濟不確定性，特區政府正持續發掘新增長點，其中全速發展的北部都會區是香港經濟發展新引擎，擁有巨大發展潛力和經濟價值，為香港創造更多職位和提升生產力。特區政府同時大力發展創新科技、人工智能和相關產業，積極推進河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區發展，推動教育、科技、人才一體化發展，全力建設國際創新科技中心，為國家高質量發展貢獻更大力量。"
​勞工及福利局局長為「賽馬會護老導航照顧者支援計劃」研討會主禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-11-18 18:22,2025-11-18 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800717.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十一月十八日）為「賽馬會護老導航照顧者支援計劃」（計劃）研討會主禮的致辭全文：

胡家驃先生（香港賽馬會董事）、聶德權教授（計劃諮詢委員會召集人）、樓瑋群教授（計劃首席研究員、香港大學秀圃老年研究中心總監及社會工作及社會行政學系教授）、各位社福界的朋友、以及今日參與的各位人士：

我很高興今日能出席「賽馬會護老導航照顧者支援計劃」（計劃）研討會。數算一下，去年五月計劃的啓動禮雖如在眼前，轉眼間已有成果。十分感謝香港賽馬會、聶德權教授、香港大學，以及所有參與的社福界好友，這麼快就做到一個以數據為本為實證基礎的研討會。

剛剛胡家驃表示，我們已進入一個老齡化社會，大家都知道，在座可能也有不少長者，香港每四個就有一個65歲或以上的長者，這意味着照顧者已經不是一個很特殊的群組。其實環顧四周，很多本身都是照顧者，過往我們很少提到照顧者這個概念，我們更多注意是有需要人士、有需要組群，但過去數年，照顧者這三個字慢慢就進入了我們的詞彙，社會上也是越來越關心照顧者。政府和賽馬會是合作夥伴，當然是有些分別的，政府是做一些恆久化的工作，而賽馬會是更加好的，它們很多時會先行一步，進行一些先行先試計劃，亦會投入大量資源，這方面政府和賽馬會之間的合作就取得很好的成果。

容許我用一些時間賣廣告，其實大家都知道的，但我也提一提，包括政府做了三年的照顧者運動，這看似只是談及照顧者，但我們覺得要令社會對照顧者有重新理解，同時要改變照顧者自己的價值觀和心態，不要覺得做照顧者就是這樣，不要怨亦不要呼救，其實照顧者也要照顧好自己，這是第一點。第二就是我們有照顧者資訊網，這方面很多謝樹仁大學幫我們建立；以及大家已經很熟悉的電話號碼，就是24小時照顧者支援專線182 183，若照顧者遇到任何困難，隨時可致電這個號碼。而賽馬會亦有護老導航照顧者支援計劃，這令到整個支援照顧者的措施更加豐富。此外，《施政報告》亦有提及，政府已預留了五億元特定資源進一步支援照顧者，我認為這一切都標誌着我們正朝着一個正確的方向行走。

今日的研討會，我認為有數個重點看似是技術性的問題，但剛剛聶德權教授亦提到，我覺得很重要的是數據為本， 但只是數據為本是不足夠的，這是一個一體化整體的系統，集中了一些數據，你們稱為「一卡通」，將數據集中一齊，我覺得這是十分重要的，政府都會朝着這個方向去做。如果數據是散開的話，第一，我們未能進行分析，第二就像是明明它是一些寶石、黃金來的，但卻得物無所用。但如果我們有一個統一的平台、統一的數據模式進行分析的話，不單是可以做到更精準的分析，更可以讓我們找到有需要的人士，以及對怎樣可以再改進服務能提供更多的幫助。其實政府一直進行相關工作，政府已經在《個人資料（私隱）條例》（《私隱條例》）下找到合適方案，在符合《私隱條例》的要求下，政府內部數據和醫院管理局（醫管局）的數據都已經互通，只要符合《私隱條例》下關於與健康掛鈎的數據我們都正在進行整合。即我們在做醫社合作的同時，政府內部的數據也進行了互通，這對我們幫助很多，就是用數據去尋找一些我們認為是風險高的，無論是護老者或是要照顧殘疾人士的照顧者，這對我們的工作是大大有所提升的。我們基本上有信心用數據找到大量照顧者出來，這亦意味着我們的挑戰已經由尋找照顧者，變成是怎樣可以對照顧者提供幫忙，令到找出來的高風險、有困難的照顧者能得到適切幫忙，這方面我們一定要攜手努力向前，賽馬會做的工作是為我們提供了一些實證為本的可行性，我熱切期待大家一會兒的分享。

除了要祝研討會取得圓滿成功之外，我亦要做兩個呼籲，一個是關於明日、後日天氣轉冷，所以各位照顧者，無論是你自己還是被照顧的對象，請大家確保要保暖。第二，我和胡家驃一樣，這段時間一定會說一個最重要的信息，這裏大家都是社福界不同界別的，請大家記住十二月七日出來立法會投票。我們已經做了實事，每一個長者中心、殘疾人士地區支援中心都會有兩萬元的津貼，方便大家、其實很多是照顧者，我都很高興向大家透露，剛剛我上車之前知道，所有的長者中心、所有的殘疾人士地區支援中心，都已經登記了會拿這兩萬元津貼，這意味着所有有需要的家庭都會得到適切的照顧，確保在十二月七日，大家可以好好履行你們的公民責任，多謝大家。"

The Forum marks a significant milestone, inviting three prominent local universities' think tanks as co-organisers: Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, HKUST Li & Fung Supply Chain Institute, and the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy, HKU Business School. The Forum brought together more than 20 experts, academics, business leaders and government officials from overseas, the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong to deliver presentations, integrating the latest dynamics and trends of global transformations, examining the impacts and challenges faced by the global economy, and focusing on key topics such as the nation's economic development strategy during the 15th Five-Year Plan period, sustainable development models for regional economic co-operation in the world, and how Hong Kong can enhance its international competitiveness and contribute to future global economic development in the evolving landscape.

 The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, and member of the Leading Party Members' Group and Secretary-General, Chinese Academy of Social Science, Dr Zhao Zhimin, delivered welcoming remarks at the Forum. Columbia University Professor and Nobel Memorial Prize laureate in Economic Sciences Professor Joseph E Stiglitz and the Head of the CEPU, Dr Stephen Wong, took part in a fireside chat. Philip H Knight Professor Emeritus of Management, Graduate School of Business, Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and Nobel Memorial Prize laureate in Economic Sciences Professor Michael Spence also delivered a special address.

 Mr Lee said, ""Our country is solidly on a path of high-quality development, creating a stable platform for global growth. As part of this national endeavour, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is proud to contribute its unique advantages, which also enable us to play a critical role in global economic transformations. Under the 'one country, two systems' principle, Hong Kong enjoys the dual advantage of having both national and global opportunities. In these times of economic uncertainty, Hong Kong, as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder', builds bridges for a world of mutual opportunity, offering a market-friendly business environment. We are working now, proactively, to align ourselves with the 15th Five-Year Plan, fulfil Hong Kong's responsibilities and seize the plentiful opportunities there for us.""

 In addition, the Forum included three panel discussion sessions, with the first session in the morning focusing on Global Significance of China’s New Development Plan. The remaining two sessions were held in the afternoon with focused discussions on The New Development Landscape of Hong Kong and The Integrated Symbiosis of Regional Economies in the World. Academician, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Dr Cai Fang; Vice Director, Economic Committee of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and former Vice Minister, Development Research Center of the State Council, Dr Liu Shijin; member of the Standing Committee, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Chairman, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong, Dr Jonathan Choi; member, International Advisory Council, National Financial Regulatory Administration Mr Andrew Sheng; Academician of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Dr Zhang Yuyan; Council Chairman, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Foreign Member, US National Academy of Engineering, Professor Harry Shum; the Chairman, Fosun International, Mr Guo Guangchang; the Chairman, Vital Technology Group, Mr Zhu Shihui; Dean and Professor, School of Business, University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Professor He Dexu; the Managing Director and member of the Managing Board, World Economic Forum, Ms Neo Gim Huay; the Director, the Institute for European Policymaking, Bocconi University, Professor Daniel Gros; the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, First Eastern Investment Group, Mr Victor Chu; and the Chairman, Europe-Asia Center, former Under-Secretary-General, United Nations, and former Executive Director, United Nations Environment Programme, Mr Erik Solheim, also spoke at the Forum. The Provost and Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Philip Wong Kennedy Wong Professor in Political Economy, the University of Hong Kong, Professor Richard Wong; the Executive Director, Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance and Associate Professor of Economics, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Professor Terence Chong; and the Chairman, Fung Investments, Dr Victor Fung, were the moderators for the three panel discussion sessions respectively.

 Dr Wong said, ""At this pivotal juncture following the victorious conclusion of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the formulation of the 15th Five-Year Plan, against the backdrop of accelerating global transformations unseen in a century, the CEPU has once again collaborated with two high-level think tanks affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Together with three world-leading university think tanks in Hong Kong, we have jointly organised this International Forum. The Forum establishes a platform with international influence for high-level dialogue and exchange among the academic community, business leaders and think tanks. Renowned speakers from the United States, Europe, ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong and across the globe have been invited. This initiative serves a dual purpose: to deepen international exchanges and co-operation for local think tanks, thereby enhancing their global influence; and to explore international and national economic development trends, uncovering Hong Kong's unique advantage as a bridge connecting the Chinese Mainland and the world. This will accelerate Hong Kong's integration into and contribution to the broader National Development landscape.""

 Around 600 participants attended the Forum including experts, academics and personnel from overseas institutions in Hong Kong as well as representatives from think tanks, the business sector, professional bodies and local and foreign chambers of commerce."

Remarks by S for Health at media session on latest progress of establishment of new medical school (with photo/video),2025-11-18 18:11,2025-11-18 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800602.htm,"Following are the remarks made by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, at a media session on the latest progress of the establishment of the new medical school today (November 18):

Reporter: First, I would like to ask about what set UST apart from the other two contenders in setting up the third medical school in Hong Kong? Was the university rankings or academic performances also taken into account when deciding which school to be put forward for the ExCo to approve? Secondly, you also mentioned that UST will first have its medical school in Clear Water Bay starting from the 2028 intake. Can you also explain why UST, or the Government, sees the needs to first have the transitional arrangement, instead of having the school be set up in the Northern Metropolis?

Secretary for Health: As I have emphasised, the criteria for making this decision to let Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (UST) build our third medical school is based on a basket of criteria, 10 major criteria, and it is a holistic assessment. It is not based on one single criteria. The UST has a lot of important advantages in terms of, for example, their innovative strategic positioning and building up of clinical scientists. Their university ranking is certainly one of the matters that we considered, as we see the UST has a more global outlook. The financial model that they proposed is more in line with the policy of having a matching in our subsidy in this important venture.

About the reason for having an interim campus in Clear Water Bay, the Ngau Tam Mei site would not be ready by the year of 2028, which is the proposed year for the initiation of the medical curriculum for the UST, so we have to have an interim campus for teaching. The Ngau Tam Mei campus would likely be ready in around 2034 to 2035, so we have to rely on the interim campus for teaching for the time being.

Also, because the teaching hospital in Ngau Tam Mei would not be ready for quite a while, we will need to rely on some other teaching hospitals which are actually included in the proposal by the UST, and this is also the reason that we have to seek the support from the Hospital Authority (HA), which is the main healthcare service provider taking care of about 90 per cent of people in Hong Kong. At present, the two universities also rely on the HA hospitals for teaching, and students are actually sent to different hospital clusters for learning, so we will co-ordinate with the Hospital Authority to support the new medical school's clinical teaching.

(Please also refer to the Chinese portion of the remarks.)"

環境及生態局局長在環境及生態局與兩間電力公司舉行的二○二六年電費調整記者會開場發言（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-11-18 17:50,2025-11-18 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800687.htm,"以下是環境及生態局局長謝展寰今日（十一月十八日）在環境及生態局與兩間電力公司舉行的二○二六年電費調整記者會的開場發言：
​
各位市民，傳媒朋友，大家好！

今日我們向大家報告二○二六年電費調整的檢討結果。

政府的電力供應政策是要確保市民能夠享有安全、可靠、環保及價格合理的電力供應，所以政府一直努力按《管制計劃協議》嚴格把關。

我們為市民把關的工作不是今年於檢討才做。我們前年審核兩電的五年發展計劃時我們已開始把關，審核兩電在計劃中所建議的資本項目的需要性、進行新項目的時間及預算是否合理。我們只接納在香港實際需求下，絕對有必要的資本項目建議，目的就是將電費盡量壓縮。

今年，在每年一次的電費調整的檢討中，政府同樣嚴格審核兩電的電費建議。在五年計劃的背景下，我們主要審核兩電預測的售電量，因為售電量會對價格有直接影響。我們亦審核兩電的營運開支和燃料價格的估算是否合理，務求盡量調低電費。經多番磋商後，兩電最終同意下調明年一月的平均淨電費。基本電費方面，中電亦同意調低於五年發展計劃下預測明年的基本電費，而港燈就與預測水平一致。

按兩電估算，電費調整後，一個每月用電量為275度的典型三人家庭的電費與二○二五年的批准電費率相比，每月會大約少付10元。

同時，政府亦要求兩電繼續動用其社區節約能源基金提供補助，盡量減低電費對弱勢社群及中小企的壓力。

雖然明年一月的平均淨電費會有輕微下調，但從環保的角度，我們鼓勵市民建立綠色生活的習慣，和選用能源效益高的產品，可以進一步減少電費支出，亦幫助減少碳排放和保護環境。政府推行的強制性能源效益標籤計劃涵蓋11種產品，並已於二○二五年九月起全面提升冷凍器具、洗衣機及儲水式電熱水器的能源效益要求。該強制性能源效益標籤計劃每年可額外節省約2.7億度電，相當約80 000個三人家庭的每年用電量。市民可到政府設立的「全民節能」網站參考「節能小貼士」，了解更多節約能源的方法，齊齊實踐「智慧用電」。

​
各位市民，傳媒朋友，大家好！

今日我們向大家報告二○二六年電費調整的檢討結果。

政府的電力供應政策是要確保市民能夠享有安全、可靠、環保及價格合理的電力供應，所以政府一直努力按《管制計劃協議》嚴格把關。

我們為市民把關的工作不是今年於檢討才做。我們前年審核兩電的五年發展計劃時我們已開始把關，審核兩電在計劃中所建議的資本項目的需要性、進行新項目的時間及預算是否合理。我們只接納在香港實際需求下，絕對有必要的資本項目建議，目的就是將電費盡量壓縮。

今年，在每年一次的電費調整的檢討中，政府同樣嚴格審核兩電的電費建議。在五年計劃的背景下，我們主要審核兩電預測的售電量，因為售電量會對價格有直接影響。我們亦審核兩電的營運開支和燃料價格的估算是否合理，務求盡量調低電費。經多番磋商後，兩電最終同意下調明年一月的平均淨電費。基本電費方面，中電亦同意調低於五年發展計劃下預測明年的基本電費，而港燈就與預測水平一致。

按兩電估算，電費調整後，一個每月用電量為275度的典型三人家庭的電費與二○二五年的批准電費率相比，每月會大約少付10元。

同時，政府亦要求兩電繼續動用其社區節約能源基金提供補助，盡量減低電費對弱勢社群及中小企的壓力。

雖然明年一月的平均淨電費會有輕微下調，但從環保的角度，我們鼓勵市民建立綠色生活的習慣，和選用能源效益高的產品，可以進一步減少電費支出，亦幫助減少碳排放和保護環境。政府推行的強制性能源效益標籤計劃涵蓋11種產品，並已於二○二五年九月起全面提升冷凍器具、洗衣機及儲水式電熱水器的能源效益要求。該強制性能源效益標籤計劃每年可額外節省約2.7億度電，相當約80 000個三人家庭的每年用電量。市民可到政府設立的「全民節能」網站參考「節能小貼士」，了解更多節約能源的方法，齊齊實踐「智慧用電」。

長遠而言，為穩定電費，政府會繼續探討多項措施，包括加強區域合作和推動能源效益及節約能源。

接着我會邀請兩間電力公司，先是請中電，然後請港燈，就二○二六年電費調整的檢討結果作介紹。"

大家好，我很高興以籌建新醫學院工作組（工作組）聯席主席的身分，和盧局長（醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授）一同向大家公布籌建新醫學院的重要決定。工作組自去年十月成立以來，各專家顧問及成員盡心盡力，通過全面和綜合的評核方法，高效地為各院校的計劃書進行評估，並且向政府提供籌建新醫學院的建議。三所大學較早前提交的建議書，內容非常詳盡，構思新穎，而且各具特色，各有所長，對於擴展醫學教育和創新研究，培育未來醫療人才等方面都展示了院校的承擔和智慧。

香港是全球唯一擁有五所世界百強大學的城市。高等教育具有高度國際化和多元化的特色，新醫學院的成立將為我們的高等教育注入新動力，為醫療教育擴容提質，進一步鞏固香港作為國際專上教育樞紐的地位。新醫學院亦將加速香港配合《教育強國建設規劃綱要（2024-2035年）》的國家藍圖，發展世界一流大學和一流學科。此外，新醫學院位處牛潭尾北都大學城，具策略性地理優勢，有利以卓越學術及研究帶動粵港澳大灣區，以至整個北部都會區的協同合作，令大學城充分發揮作用，吸引更多海內外學生和學者來港升學及做研究，為國家及香港做好人才支撐。

成立新醫學院將會促進香港的醫療教育邁向新里程。我們相信香港科技大學能夠運用自身的優勢，為新醫學院引入創新課程設計及多元收生安排，承擔起培育未來醫療人才的重任，並在拓展醫學教育及研究範疇的同時，亦推動大學的整體發展，促進跨學科和跨界別協作，成為支持香港高等教育發展的新動能。

藉此機會，我亦衷心感謝工作組顧問專家及成員，多謝他們的無私付出，從不同角度為評核工作提供了專業和寶貴的意見，亦特別感謝提交建議書的三間大學，它們為香港醫療教育的未來出謀獻策，貢獻大學的智慧和力量。

展望未來，新醫學院不僅肩負培育專才以應對醫療人手短缺加劇的使命，更要與現有的香港大學和香港中文大學兩所醫學院並肩前行，錯位發展，亦同時推動院校之間的合作，共同提升香港在醫療服務、科研及醫學教育的水平和實力。工作組將會繼續引領及監察新醫學院的籌建過程，並與科大緊密合作，攜手落實籌建新醫學院的工作計劃，實現共同願景。謝謝。"

醫務衞生局局長：各位傳媒朋友，今日，我很高興聯同教育局蔡若蓮局長，在此向大家公布一個政府重要決定。行政長官會同行政會議剛剛參考了籌備新醫學院工作組的建議，通過批准本港第三間醫學院交由香港科技大學（科大）籌辦。

建設第三間醫學院，不僅是為了增加本地培訓的醫生，以應對人手短缺的挑戰和面對人口老化的問題，更重要是希望引入錯位發展，做到良性競爭，與現有兩所醫學院產生協同創新，以至疊加效應，長遠提升香港醫療方面，不單是服務，還有科研及醫學教育的水平和實力，達致將香港發展成國際醫療創新樞紐的目標。

二○二四年行政長官《施政報告》宣布支持籌辦第三間醫學院，成立籌備新醫學院工作組，而我和蔡若蓮局長擔任聯席主席。在過去一年，通過跟各部門、政策局，本港和海內外專家顧問共同商討，一直以嚴謹、全面、公正和專業的態度，全速推進評核工作。工作組根據十項主要準則，就三份計劃書作出深入的技術評估，範圍包括新醫學的課程、創新策略定位、醫學教研隊伍及人手、收生安排、教學設施、臨床經驗與學習資源、資金及財務安排、實施計劃、教學與學習質素和卓越研究等。

參考了工作組的評核結果及意見，我們有信心交由科大按照其計劃書籌建的新醫學院可達到「錯位發展，協同創新」的重要目標。透過創新策略定位，科大的全球視野可致力培養能夠引領未來醫學發展，兼具臨床能力與科研素養的醫學科研人才。這不僅能與現有兩所醫學院形成優勢互補，更可以通過良性競爭、疊加效應，為香港的醫療創新注入強大動力。

在資金方面，科技大學會透過其自身資源（包括捐款和捐贈基金等）爲新醫學院提供部分資金，配合《財政預算案》提出以配對形式的政策方向，其中包括科大會自資超過20億元興建位於清水灣的醫學院綜合大樓，政府亦會預留資源支持新醫學院的發展，並以教資會撥款資助新學額，作為醫學院的營運資金。

科大稍後會向傳媒介紹籌建新醫學院的發展計劃。

為確保這項關鍵項目能順利落實，工作組將繼續工作，從而處理落實相關事宜，包括盡快與科大敲定籌建新醫學院的方案細節，並就具體安排簽訂諒解備忘錄。這些細節涵蓋資金安排、課程認證、教學醫院資源，以至招募教職員等。工作組會協助和監督科大的籌備工作。

另一方面，醫院管理局亦會配合新醫學院教學醫院臨床訓練的相關安排。視乎資金安排和籌備進度，我們的目標是於二○二八年迎來新醫學院首批約50名醫科學生，預計二○三二年會有首批畢業生開始實習。

香港的醫療教育一向享負盛名，擁有兩所位列QS世界大學學科排名全球首25位的醫學院，學術和研究實力非常雄厚。政府會繼績支持香港大學和香港中文大學兩所優秀的醫學院。同時，我相信在現有兩所醫學院的鼎力支持下，新醫學院會成爲另一所國際一流的醫學院，香港醫學教育的另一重要標桿。

在此，我衷心感謝工作組所有成員，特別是海內外專家過去一年多盡心盡力的貢獻。我也期待在未來實施方案、籌建第三間醫學院時，工作組成員會繼續為我們提供寶貴的意見與支持。我在此代表特區政府衷心感謝提交建議書的另外兩所大學，包括香港浸會大學和香港理工大學，他們提出的方案都極具心思和遠見，體現其對香港培訓未來醫護人手的重要堅定承擔。醫務衞生局與教育局將與浸會大學及理工大學跟進，兩校在其建議書提出的寶貴意見，希望協助兩間大學根據其提供的方針，發揮各自優勢，與醫療教育界，包括新建立醫學院建立更緊密合作關係，從而提升整體香港醫療教育的質素。

在此，我先邀請工作組的另一位聯席主席——教育局蔡若蓮局長發言。然後我會回答大家的問題，謝謝。"

香港的醫療教育一向享負盛名，擁有兩所位列QS世界大學學科排名全球首25位的醫學院，學術和研究實力非常雄厚。政府會繼績支持香港大學和香港中文大學兩所優秀的醫學院。同時，我相信在現有兩所醫學院的鼎力支持下，新醫學院會成爲另一所國際一流的醫學院，香港醫學教育的另一重要標桿。

在此，我衷心感謝工作組所有成員，特別是海內外專家過去一年多盡心盡力的貢獻。我也期待在未來實施方案、籌建第三間醫學院時，工作組成員會繼續為我們提供寶貴的意見與支持。我在此代表特區政府衷心感謝提交建議書的另外兩所大學，包括香港浸會大學和香港理工大學，他們提出的方案都極具心思和遠見，體現其對香港培訓未來醫護人手的重要堅定承擔。醫務衞生局與教育局將與浸會大學及理工大學跟進，兩校在其建議書提出的寶貴意見，希望協助兩間大學根據其提供的方針，發揮各自優勢，與醫療教育界，包括新建立醫學院建立更緊密合作關係，從而提升整體香港醫療教育的質素。

在此，我先邀請工作組的另一位聯席主席——教育局蔡若蓮局長發言。然後我會回答大家的問題，謝謝。"
Chief Executive in Council approves proposal for establishment of new medical school,2025-11-18 17:22,2025-11-18 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800644.htm,"  The Government announced today (November 18) that the Chief Executive in Council has approved the establishment of the third medical school, and has approved in principle for the new medical school to be established by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

  The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, said, ""Hong Kong is proactively developing into an international medical training, research and innovation hub. The establishment of the third medical school to train more healthcare professionals is crucial to enhancing local healthcare services. I thank the expert advisors of the Task Group on New Medical School for their efforts in the past year for completing the evaluation in an efficient, professional and fair manner within a short period of time, laying a solid foundation for the establishment of the third medical school. The third medical school will work closely with the two existing medical schools to complement each other's strengths, enhance the standard and capabilities of Hong Kong's scientific research and medical education, and respond to the national strategy of building the nation into a leading country in education.""

  A Government spokesman said that the expert advisors and members of the Task Group conducted an in-depth review of the proposals submitted by the three universities from various perspectives including innovative strategic positioning, curriculum structure and financial sustainability. Having regard to the Task Group's evaluation outcome and recommendation, the Chief Executive in Council has approved in principle for the new medical school to be established by the HKUST to launch a new four-year graduate-level entry medical programme. The HKUST shall aim to admit its first cohort of 50 students in the 2028/29 academic year. Before commencement of student admission, the HKUST must obtain an in-principle approval from the Medical Council of Hong Kong for the accreditation of its medical curriculum.

  The HKUST should proceed with the planning, preparation and establishment of the third medical school. It shall sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government on key implementation requirements, including curriculum accreditation, financing, staffing, campus development and teaching hospital arrangements, and collaborate closely with the Government and the Task Group on relevant matters during the implementation stage. The HKUST has pledged to commit its own resources (including donations and funds) to partially fund for the establishment of the new medical school, including contributing over $2 billion to build a new complex on its Clear Water Bay campus as the premises for the new medical school.

  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""Today is an important day for Hong Kong's healthcare system. The establishment of the new medical school will nurture more outstanding doctors to support the local healthcare system in providing quality services, while at the same time raising the standard and capacity of Hong Kong's scientific research and medical education, developing Hong Kong into a leading hub for nurturing scientific research and clinical talent in health and medical innovation. The Task Group and the HKUST have a tight schedule ahead. I look forward to the HKUST finalising the implementation details of the third medical school's establishment plan shortly. We are confident that the establishment of the new medical school will introduce healthy competition, and expect the two existing medical schools to fully support its development, thereby creating synergy.""

  The Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, said, ""The proposals submitted by the three universities are detailed and each has its own merits, with institutional characteristics and innovative ideas. They demonstrate the higher education sector's unity in medical education and related professional training to jointly create a better future for Hong Kong. Education is the foundation for building China into a great country and achieving national rejuvenation. Hong Kong is currently the only city in the world with five universities in the world's top 100, and the establishment of the new medical school will inject new impetus into our higher education, further consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international post-secondary education hub and an international hub for high-calibre talent. The new medical school will also accelerate Hong Kong's alignment with the national blueprint of the 2024-2035 master plan on building China into a leading country in education for building world-class universities and academic subjects. I expect the university to continue to seize the opportunities of the Northern Metropolis University Town, to develop synergy with neighbouring industries, and to provide talent support for the country and Hong Kong.""

  Professor Lo added, ""The three proposals are each distinctive and demonstrate their unique strengths. The proposal from Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) advocates for an integrated Chinese-Western medicine programme; the proposal from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) focuses on inter-professional training and the application of artificial intelligence; while the HKUST concentrates on training physician-scientists who possess both clinical capabilities and scientific research expertise. I am deeply encouraged that the three universities have submitted proposals for the establishment of a new medical school, demonstrating their commitment to the development and innovation of healthcare in Hong Kong.""

  The Chief Executive announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the Government supports the establishment of the third medical school by a local university to nurture more outstanding medical practitioners to support the local healthcare system in providing quality services, while at the same time promoting the development of Hong Kong into an international medical training, research and innovation hub. The Task Group was established in October 2024, comprising seasoned local, Mainland and overseas academics in medical education and university management, professionals, representatives from the Medical Council of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, as well as representatives from the relevant government bureaux and departments. The Task Group issued a letter of invitation in December 2024 to all University Grants Committee-funded universities to submit proposals for the establishment of the third medical school. By the deadline in March 2025, three proposals were received from HKBU, the PolyU and the HKUST. The Task Group held two rounds of meetings with the universities that submitted proposals in May and June 2025."
行政長官會同行政會議批准設立新醫學院建議,2025-11-18 17:16,2025-11-18 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800639.htm,"政府今日（十一月十八日）公布行政長官會同行政會議已通過設立第三所醫學院，並原則上批准新醫學院由香港科技大學（科大）籌辦。

行政長官李家超表示：「香港積極發展成為國際醫療培訓、研究和創新樞紐，設立第三所醫學院以培訓更多醫療人才，對提升本地醫療服務至關重要。我感謝籌備新醫學院工作組的專家顧問過去一年的努力，在短時間內以高效、專業及公平的方式完成評核，為設立第三所醫學院打下堅實基礎。第三所醫學院將與現有兩間醫學院緊密合作，優勢互補，提升香港的科研及醫學教育的水平和實力，響應國家建設教育強國的宏大目標。」

政府發言人表示，工作組專家顧問及成員從創新策略定位、課程結構及財政可持續性等多個範疇深入審視了三間大學提交的建議書。參考了工作組的評核結果及意見，行政長官會同行政會議原則上批准新醫學院由科大籌辦，開辦一個全新的四年制第二學位醫學課程。科大須以在二○二八／二九學年錄取第一屆50名學生為目標。科大在招收學生之前須獲得香港醫務委員會原則上同意認可其醫學課程。

科大應着手規劃、籌備和設立第三所醫學院，並須就主要的實施要求（包括課程認證、財政、教職員人手、校園發展和教學醫院安排）與政府簽訂諒解備忘錄，在實施階段就相關事宜與政府及工作組通力合作。科大將透過其自身資源（包括捐款和基金）為新醫學院提供部分資金，包括出資超過20億元於清水灣校園內興建一所新的綜合大樓作為新醫學院的校舍。

醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授表示：「今日是對香港醫療體系重要的一天。籌建新醫學院將培訓更多優秀醫生以支持本地醫療體系提供優質服務，同時提升香港的科研及醫學教育水平和實力，令香港成為首屈一指培養醫療創新的科研和臨床人才的樞紐。工作組和科大接下來的工作非常緊湊，我期待科大盡快落實第三所醫學院建設方案的細節。深信新醫學院的成立將能引入良性競爭，我們期望現有兩所醫學院會鼎力支持籌建新醫學院並產生協同效應。」

教育局局長蔡若蓮博士表示：「三所大學提交的建議書，具有院校特色和創見、詳盡而各有所長，在醫學教育及醫療專業相關培訓方面展現高等教育界別團結一致，共同為香港締造更好前景。教育是強國建設、民族復興之基。香港現時是全球唯一擁有五所世界百強大學的城市，而新醫學院的成立將為我們的高等教育注入新動力，進一步鞏固香港成為國際專上教育樞紐及國際高端人才集聚高地。新醫學院亦將加速香港配合《教育強國建設規劃綱要（2024–2035年）》的國家藍圖，發展世界一流大學和一流學科。我期望大學繼續把握北都大學城的機遇，與周邊產業協同發展，為國家及香港做好人才支撐。」

盧寵茂教授補充：「三份建議書各有特色並體現其獨特優勢，香港浸會大學的建議提倡中西醫結合醫學課程，香港理工大學的建議着重於跨專業及人工智能應用，而科大則專注於培養兼具臨床能力與科研素養的醫學科研人才。我對三所大學就成立新醫學院提交建議書，展現出對香港醫療發展及創新的承擔，深受鼓舞。」

行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》宣布，支持本地大學籌建第三所醫學院，以培養更多優秀醫生支持本地醫療體系提供優質服務，同時推動香港發展成為國際醫療培訓、研究和創新樞紐。工作組於二○二四年十月成立，由具豐富醫學教學和大學管理經驗的本地和海內外學者、專業人士、香港醫務委員會和香港醫學專科學院代表，以及相關政府政策局和部門代表組成。工作組在二○二四十二月向所有大學教育資助委員會資助大學發信，邀請有意成立新醫學院的本地大學提交建設第三所醫學院建議書，在二○二五年三月截止日期前共接獲三份來自香港浸會大學、香港理工大學和香港科技大學的建議書。工作組與提交建議書大學於二○二五年五月及六月進行兩輪會面。"

十一月份第三批涵蓋七個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及六個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十一月共三批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共31個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年十月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這31個監察區中，22個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有九區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

​食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Among the third batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering seven survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering six survey areas in November, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released three batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in November 2025, covering 31 survey areas. Among these 31 survey areas, 22 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. October 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Nine other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside the premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD is disseminating the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

香港金融管理局（香港金管局）和迪拜金融服務管理局（迪拜金管局）今日（十一月十八日）發表題為《擴大新興市場可持續債務市場規模》的研究報告。彭博新能源財經為報告的知識合作夥伴。報告載述聯合研究項目的主要成果，該研究旨在探索新興市場如何發揮可持續債務工具的潛力，以促進可持續發展。

研究報告顯示，中東與北非地區以及亞太新興地區的可持續債務市場有很大發展空間，不少發行人及借款人在為可持續項目進行融資時仍未使用可持續債務工具。政府可透過抵銷可持續債務工具發行費用及提供指引等支援措施，協助發行人應對進入市場的挑戰。鼓勵更多企業發行、提升綠色以外其他可持續債務標籤的使用，以及探索新的發行結構，均可為市場提供增長動力。

報告亦涵蓋三個案例研究，展示可持續金融在傳統標籤、年期及結構方面的創新，包括迪拜環球港務集團發行的藍色債券、阿聯酋迪拜國民銀行發行的可持續發展掛鈎貸款債券，以及香港鐵路有限公司發行的長年期綠色債券及貸款。

迪拜金管局總裁施衛民表示：「這項研究提供有關可持續債務在中東與北非以及亞太新興地區演變的洞察分析。二○二四年達940億美元的發行額反映投資者對此領域的信心日益增加，也體現了我們市場具備的韌性。我們將繼續重點支持各類可持續及轉型金融，以確保迪拜國際金融中心、阿拉伯聯合酋長國以至整個地區的市場長期保持穩健及具公信力。」

香港金管局總裁余偉文表示：「可持續債務是具潛力的金融工具，有助填補新興市場數以萬億美元計的氣候資金缺口。透過是次聯合研究，我們希望探索如何消除發行人面對的障礙，並尋找增長機遇。作為二○二四年安排亞洲區內45%國際綠色債券發行的可持續金融中心，香港致力透過利用其基建及實踐經驗，支持新興市場達至可持續發展目標。」

彭博新能源財經首席執行官Jon Moore表示：「可持續債務有助金融市場中信任的建立和透明度的提升。香港金管局和迪拜金管局共同推動可持續債務市場發展，為擴大能源轉型投融資規模提供寶貴支持。我們希望這份報告以及在行業中領先的見解，能夠幫助監管機構和市場參與者應對能源轉型，並把握機遇，共同推進全球可持續發展的目標。」

十一月二十六日，迪拜金管局與香港金管局將在迪拜舉行聯合氣候金融會議。屆時將設環節討論報告重點內容。

Report on unlocking potential of sustainable debt,2025-11-18 16:40,2025-11-18 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800288.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) today (November 18) published a research report titled Scaling Sustainable Debt in Emerging Markets, with BloombergNEF as a knowledge partner, which presents key findings from a joint research project that explores the potential of labelled debt for facilitating sustainable development in emerging markets.

The research report shows that labelled sustainable debt markets across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and emerging Asia Pacific (APAC) have significant room to grow, with many issuers and borrowers financing sustainable projects with unlabelled instruments. Government support to offset labelling costs and provide guidance can ease the challenges when issuers go to market. Encouraging greater corporate issuance and expanding beyond the green label as well as typical structures present other avenues for growth. 

The report also features three case studies showcasing innovation in sustainable finance beyond conventional labels, tenors and structures: a blue bond from DP World, a sustainability-linked loan bond from Emirates NBD, and long-tenor green bond and loan from MTR Corporation Limited.

The Chief Executive of the DFSA, Mr Mark Steward, said, ""This research provides valuable insight into how sustainable debt is evolving across the MENA and emerging APAC regions. The US$94 billion issuance record in 2024 reflects growing investor confidence and the resilience of our markets. Our focus remains on supporting all forms of sustainable and transition finance to ensure that the market within the DIFC (Dubai International Financial Centre), United Arab Emirates (UAE), and across the region remains robust and credible for the long term.""

The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue,said, ""Sustainable debt is a promising tool for bridging the multi-trillion-dollar climate financing gap in emerging markets. Through this joint research, we aim to explore solutions to remove the barriers faced by issuers and identify opportunities for growth. As Asia's leading sustainable finance hub that arranges 45 per cent of the region's international green bond issuances in 2024, Hong Kong is committed to leveraging our infrastructure and know-how to support emerging markets in reaching their sustainable development goals.""

  The Chief Executive of BloombergNEF, Mr Jon Moore, said, ""Sustainable debt helps build trust and transparency in the financial market. The effort by the HKMA and the DFSA to drive the development of sustainable debt markets provides valuable support to scale up finance and investment for energy transition. We hope this report and our industry leading insights can help regulators and market participants navigate this transition and capture opportunities that advance global sustainability objectives.""

The insights from the report will be discussed during the DFSA-HKMA Joint Climate Finance Conference on November26 in Dubai.

The full report is available here.

After an investigation, it has been substantiated that the company had, without obtaining the LD's prior consent, changed the recruitment terms of the applied post, including the work location and job duties, as stated in the local open recruitment exercise. This violated the requirements of local recruitment. An administrative sanction is thus imposed,"" a spokesman for the LD said.

The spokesman continued, ""The ESLS stipulates that if an employer violates labour or immigration laws, the requirements of the ESLS or the Standard Employment Contract, the LD will impose an administrative sanction on the employer, including withdrawal of approval for importation of labour previously granted and refusal to process any subsequent applications submitted by the employer.""

二零二五年八月至十月失業及就業不足統計數字,2025-11-18 16:30,2025-11-18 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800530.htm,"根據政府統計處今日（十一月十八日）發表的最新勞動人口統計數字（即二零二五年八月至十月的臨時數字），經季節性調整的失業率由二零二五年七月至九月的3.9%下跌至二零二五年八月至十月的3.8%。就業不足率在該兩段期間則保持不變，維持於1.6%的水平。

與二零二五年七月至九月比較，在二零二五年八月至十月期間，許多主要經濟行業的失業率（不經季節性調整）均見下跌，其中零售、住宿及膳食服務業，專業及商用服務業（不包括清潔及同類活動），地基及上蓋工程業，以及金融業有較明顯的跌幅。各行業的就業不足率則變動不一，但幅度普遍不大。

總就業人數由二零二五年七月至九月的3 674 500人，下跌至二零二五年八月至十月的3 672 700人，減少約1 800人。同期的總勞動人口亦由3 830 100人下跌至3 822 300人，減少約7 800人。

失業人數（不經季節性調整）由二零二五年七月至九月的155 600人下跌至二零二五年八月至十月的149 600人，減少約6 000人。同期的就業不足人數則由60 000人上升至60 800人，增加約800人。

評論

勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡評論最新失業數字時表示：「二零二五年八月至十月經季節性調整的失業率較上一個三個月期間輕微下跌0.1個百分點至3.8%。就業不足率維持在1.6%不變。同期勞動人口和總就業人數稍為下跌，而失業人數亦有所減少。」

展望未來，孫玉菡說：「香港經濟穩健擴張，加上營商氣氛穩步改善和消費信心逐漸恢復，應會爲勞工市場帶來支持。然而，部分行業的就業情況仍會繼續面對經濟轉型帶來的挑戰。」

進一步資料

失業和就業不足的統計數字，是根據持續進行的「綜合住戶統計調查」結果而編製。

統計調查所採用有關失業及就業不足的定義，緊隨國際勞工組織的建議。當中，就業人口涵蓋所有僱主、自營作業者、僱員（包括全職、兼職及散工等）和無酬家庭從業員。而按行業（或職業）劃分的失業人士是按其以前從事的行業（或職業）劃分。

二零二五年八月至十月的統計調查所用的樣本，是通過一個根據科學方法設計的抽樣系統選出，包括約26 000個住戶，共約68 000人，以代表本港人口的情況。根據這個樣本編製而成的勞工統計數字反映二零二五年八月至十月的移動三個月期間的情況。

Unemployment and underemployment statistics for August - October 2025,2025-11-18 16:30,2025-11-18 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800549.htm,"  According to the latest labour force statistics (i.e. provisional figures for August - October 2025) released today (November 18) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate decreased from 3.9% in July - September 2025 to 3.8% in August - October 2025. The underemployment rate remained unchanged at 1.6% in the two periods.

  Comparing August - October 2025 with July - September 2025, the unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) decreased in many major economic sectors, with more distinct decreases observed in the retail, accommodation and food services sector; professional and business services sector (excluding cleaning and similar activities); foundation and superstructure sector; and financing sector. Movements in the underemployment rate in different industry sectors varied, but the magnitudes were generally not large.

  Total employment decreased by around 1 800 from 3 674 500 in July - September 2025 to 3 672 700 in August - October 2025. Over the same period, the labour force also decreased by around 7 800 from 3 830 100 to 3 822 300.

  The number of unemployed persons (not seasonally adjusted) decreased by around 6 000 from 155 600 in July - September 2025 to 149 600 in August - October 2025. Over the same period, the number of underemployed persons increased by around 800 from 60 000 to 60 800.

Commentary

  Commenting on the latest unemployment figures, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, said, ""The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate edged down by 0.1 percentage point over the preceding three-month period to 3.8% in August - October 2025. The underemployment rate remained unchanged at 1.6%. Over the same period, the labour force and total employment decreased slightly, while the number of unemployed persons also decreased.""

  Looking ahead, Mr Chris Sun said, ""the solid expansion of the Hong Kong economy, along with the steadfast improvement in business sentiment and the gradual recovery in consumption confidence, should provide support to the labour market. However, the employment situations of some sectors would continue to face challenges from economic restructuring.""

Further information

  The unemployment and underemployment statistics were compiled from the findings of the continuous General Household Survey.

  In the survey, the definitions used in measuring unemployment and underemployment follow closely those recommended by the International Labour Organization. The employed population covers all employers, self-employed persons, employees (including full-time, part-time, casual workers, etc.) and unpaid family workers. Unemployed persons by industry (or occupation) are classified according to their previous industry (or occupation).

  The survey for August - October 2025 covered a sample of some 26 000 households or 68 000 persons, selected in accordance with a scientifically designed sampling scheme to represent the population of Hong Kong. Labour force statistics compiled from this sample represented the situation in the moving three-month period of August to October 2025.

  Data on labour force characteristics were obtained from the survey by interviewing each member aged 15 or over in the sampled households.

  Statistical tables on the latest labour force statistics can be downloaded at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/scode200.html). More detailed analysis of the labour force characteristics is given in the ""Quarterly Report on General Household Survey"" which is published four times a year. The latest issue of the report contains statistics for the quarter April - June 2025 while the next issue covering the quarter July - September 2025 will be available by end November 2025. Users can also browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1050001&scode=200).

Hong Kong Space Museum's new exhibition to showcase work and achievements of country's astronauts on Tiangong Space Station,2025-11-18 16:00,2025-11-18 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800243.htm,"The Hong Kong Space Museum (HKSpM) will launch the ""A Voyage to Space: China's Manned Space Expedition"" exhibition from tomorrow (November 19) to April 27 next year. The exhibition showcases the journey of the country's astronauts from training to their missions aboard the Tiangong Space Station. It also highlights their work and achievements in conducting scientific experiments on the space station and performing extravehicular (EV) activities, as well as the participation of Hong Kong in projects related to the country's manned space programme. Admission is free.

The Tiangong Space Station is a ""Space Home"" constructed independently by China. It operates in low Earth orbit approximately 400 kilometres above the Earth's surface. The HKSpM transformed the exhibition area at the foyer into a ""space station"". Highlighted exhibits include a Tiangong Space Station model that illustrates the functions of its various modules, and a replica of the second-generation ""Feitian"" EV spacesuit that introduces visitors to how the EV spacesuit ensures astronauts' safety while working in the harsh conditions of space. Visitors can also engage in the interactive game ""Team Up! The Space Crew"" to discover which roles they might fit in within the manned space programmes, learning about the work of astronauts and ground support personnel.

The exhibition also introduces diverse scientific experiments conducted by astronauts in the weightless environment on the space station. Visitors can examine a planarian specimen through a microscope to gain insights into experiments on planarian regenerative ability conducted aboard the space station. Visitors can also observe zebrafish in the exhibition's aquarium to compare the behavioural differences with those raised on the space station. The ""Horticulture in Tiangong"" area showcases how scientists overcome the challenges of cultivating plants on the space station and features a small planter where visitors can identify different types of vegetables and fruits previously grown aboard the space station. These research findings not only drive current technological progress but also lay the scientific foundation for humanity's future life in space.

Astronauts have to undergo over 200 specialised training programmes. The exhibition shows video clips of astronauts conducting underwater training. They practise working in a simulated weightless environment in a neutral buoyancy pool housing a full-scale spacecraft model while wearing underwater training suits that resemble EV spacesuits. Visitors can also experience the concentration and reaction training of astronauts through an interactive game.

Lastly, the exhibition outlines Hong Kong's participation in Tiangong Space Station experiments and educational programmes, including a local university's agricultural research project launched into space, as well as the selection of Hong Kong's first payload specialist for the country's fourth batch of preparatory astronauts.

The exhibition is in celebration of the HKSpM's 45th anniversary and is one of the activities of the Chinese Culture Promotion Series. For details of the exhibition, please visit the HKSpM website at hk.space.museum/en/web/spm/exhibitions/special-exhibitions/cmse.html.

Hong Kong Space Museum's new exhibition to showcase work and achievements of country's astronauts on Tiangong Space Station (with photos),2025-11-18 16:00,2025-11-18 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800243.htm,"The Hong Kong Space Museum (HKSpM) will launch the ""A Voyage to Space: China's Manned Space Expedition"" exhibition from tomorrow (November 19) to April 27 next year. The exhibition showcases the journey of the country's astronauts from training to their missions aboard the Tiangong Space Station. It also highlights their work and achievements in conducting scientific experiments on the space station and performing extravehicular (EV) activities, as well as the participation of Hong Kong in projects related to the country's manned space programme. Admission is free.

The Tiangong Space Station is a ""Space Home"" constructed independently by China. It operates in low Earth orbit approximately 400 kilometres above the Earth's surface. The HKSpM transformed the exhibition area at the foyer into a ""space station"". Highlighted exhibits include a Tiangong Space Station model that illustrates the functions of its various modules, and a replica of the second-generation ""Feitian"" EV spacesuit that introduces visitors to how the EV spacesuit ensures astronauts' safety while working in the harsh conditions of space. Visitors can also engage in the interactive game ""Team Up! The Space Crew"" to discover which roles they might fit in within the manned space programmes, learning about the work of astronauts and ground support personnel.

The exhibition also introduces diverse scientific experiments conducted by astronauts in the weightless environment on the space station. Visitors can examine a planarian specimen through a microscope to gain insights into experiments on planarian regenerative ability conducted aboard the space station. Visitors can also observe zebrafish in the exhibition's aquarium to compare the behavioural differences with those raised on the space station. The ""Horticulture in Tiangong"" area showcases how scientists overcome the challenges of cultivating plants on the space station and features a small planter where visitors can identify different types of vegetables and fruits previously grown aboard the space station. These research findings not only drive current technological progress but also lay the scientific foundation for humanity's future life in space.

Astronauts have to undergo over 200 specialised training programmes. The exhibition shows video clips of astronauts conducting underwater training. They practise working in a simulated weightless environment in a neutral buoyancy pool housing a full-scale spacecraft model while wearing underwater training suits that resemble EV spacesuits. Visitors can also experience the concentration and reaction training of astronauts through an interactive game.

Lastly, the exhibition outlines Hong Kong's participation in Tiangong Space Station experiments and educational programmes, including a local university's agricultural research project launched into space, as well as the selection of Hong Kong's first payload specialist for the country's fourth batch of preparatory astronauts.

The exhibition is in celebration of the HKSpM's 45th anniversary and is one of the activities of the Chinese Culture Promotion Series. For details of the exhibition, please visit the HKSpM website at hk.space.museum/en/web/spm/exhibitions/special-exhibitions/cmse.html.

香港太空館新展覽展示國家航天員在天宮空間站的工作與成果（附圖）,2025-11-18 16:00,2025-11-18 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800241.htm,"香港太空館將於明日（十一月十九日）至明年四月二十七日舉辦「航向太空──中國載人航天之旅」展覽，展示國家航天員從訓練到進駐天宮空間站執行任務的歷程，重點介紹他們在空間站開展的科學實驗和出艙活動的工作與成果，以及香港參與的國家載人航天相關項目。展覽免費入場。

天宮空間站是由中國自主建造的「太空之家」，在距離地球表面約400公里的近地軌道上運行。香港太空館將位於大堂的展覽空間化身成「空間站」，亮點展品包括天宮空間站模型以介紹空間站各個艙段的用途，第二代「飛天」艙外航天服複製品讓參觀者認識艙外航天服如何保障航天員在太空嚴峻環境下工作的安全。參觀者還可透過互動遊戲「集合！航天大家族」配對自己適合在載人航天工程中擔任的崗位，從而了解航天員及一些地面支援人員的工作。

展覽亦介紹航天員在空間站的失重環境下，開展的多樣科學實驗任務。參觀者可透過顯微鏡觀察渦蟲標本，了解空間站研究渦蟲再生能力的實驗，亦可觀察展覽魚缸內的斑馬魚，以對比在空間站飼養的斑馬魚行為上的差異。「天宮農圃」部分則介紹科學家如何克服在太空站栽培植物的困難，並設小型種植箱讓參觀者認識曾於天宮空間站栽培的蔬果種類。這些研究成果不僅能推動現有科技發展，更是人類未來太空生活所需的科學基礎。

航天員需要進行二百多項的專業訓練。展覽播放航天員的水下訓練的影片，片中他們穿上近似艙外航天服的水下訓練服，在裝有航天器原大模型的中性浮力水槽中模擬在太空失重環境中工作。參觀者亦可透過互動遊戲，體驗航天員的的專注及反應訓練。

展覽最後亦介紹香港曾參與的天宮空間站實驗項目和教育活動，包括本地大學於太空進行空間搭載實驗的農業研究項目，以及首次有香港載荷專家入選國家第四批預備航天員。

展覽是慶祝香港太空館四十五周年，亦是弘揚中華文化系列活動之一。有關展覽資料，請瀏覽香港太空館網頁hk.space.museum/tc/web/spm/exhibitions/special-exhibitions/cmse.html。

2025 Guangdong/Hong Kong Seminar on Intellectual Property and Development of Small and Medium Enterprises held in Jiangmen,2025-11-18 15:00,2025-11-18 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800332.htm,"  The 2025 Guangdong/Hong Kong Seminar on Intellectual Property (IP) and Development of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), entitled ""Challenges of IP Rights in the Age of Artificial Intelligence (AI)"", was held today (November 18) in Jiangmen to explore the impacts and challenges that AI technology development poses to IP protection within the innovation ecosystem. The seminar aimed to enhance the awareness, protection and efficient use of IP among Hong Kong SMEs in Guangdong Province and Mainland enterprises and assist them in formulating effective IP strategies suitable for the AI era, thereby enabling enterprises to capitalise on the opportunities presented by the development of the digital economy to expand in the national and global markets. It was attended by over 200 representatives of SMEs and IP practitioners, as well as government officials from Guangdong and Hong Kong.

 Speaking at the opening ceremony of the seminar, the Director of Intellectual Property, Mr David Wong, said that the seminar was a significant milestone in the long and sustained efforts of the IP authorities of the two places in strengthening exchanges and collaborations in various areas over the last two decades, jointly enhancing the level of IP protection and management in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

 Mr Wong briefed the participants on Hong Kong's latest initiatives in promoting the development of IP, including the formulation of an amendment proposal for the Copyright Ordinance and a relevant code of practice regarding the protection for AI technology development, the review of the local registered designs regime, and the introduction of a series of measures to assist pilot sectors in leveraging IPs for financing. Such measures would further reinforce Hong Kong's position as a regional IP trading centre and an international innovation and technology centre, and assist in accelerating the country's development of new quality productive forces.

 Speakers presented and shared their insights on various topics at the seminar, namely ""IP issues in the era of large models: Perspectives from data and algorithms"", ""Leveraging IP strategies: Winâwin practices for SMEs and multinational corporations"", ""Legal practice in AI: Focusing on IP issues and analysis of user agreement templates"", and ""The future of data and knowledge: Innovation and practices of IP empowering corporate AI strategies"".

Since 2004, Guangdong and Hong Kong have co-organised a number of activities to promote the importance of IP protection and exploitation among SMEs. The seminar was a key co-operation item under the framework of the Guangdong/Hong Kong Expert Group on the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights, and was jointly organised by the Intellectual Property Department (IPD), the Guangdong Administration for Market Regulation (Guangdong Intellectual Property Administration), the Jiangmen Municipal People's Government and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council; undertaken by the Jiangmen Administration for Market Regulation (Jiangmen Intellectual Property Administration); and co-organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Guangdong of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The event was also supported by members of the Expert Group and the Federation of Hong Kong Industries.

 Details of the seminar are available on the IPD's website (www.ipd.gov.hk)."

Arrangements will be made with relevant stakeholders to facilitate the viewing of the recovered TPS flats put up for sale under the GSH 2024 as far as practicable.

Pricing

  The HA continues to price GSH flats at an affordable level. The discount rate for the GSH 2024 is set at 10 per cent more than that determined for the recently completed Sale of Home Ownership Scheme Flats 2024 (HOS 2024). The discount for HOS 2024, set at 30 per sent from the assessed market values (for sale at 70 per cent of the assessed market values), was based on the affordability of the applicants, i.e. at least 75 per cent of the flats for sale can allow non-owner occupier households earning the median monthly household income to spend no more than 40 per cent of their monthly income on the mortgage payment. Following the affordability-based pricing policy, the discount for GSH flats offered under the GSH 2024 is set at a 40 per cent discount from the assessed market values, i.e. for sale at 60 per cent of the assessed market values. The selling prices of the flats in Wang Chi Court range from about $1.15 million to $3.49 million, with an average selling price of about $2.47 million.

  ""Based on the average flat selling price at about $2.47 million (saleable area of about 34 sq m or about 366 sq ft), the mortgage payment is about $10,500 per month, assuming that the buyer takes out a mortgage at 95 per cent of the flat price for a term of 30 years at an interest rate of about 3.5 per cent. For one to two-person flats, the average selling price is about $1.28 million and the mortgage payment is about $5,500 per month,"" the spokesman said.

Applications received

  During the application period, the HA received a total of around 36 000 applications for the GSH 2024. Among the applications received, around 30 000 came from family applicants, of which around 16 000 applied under the Priority Scheme for Families with Elderly Members (Priority Elderly Scheme) and Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme (Priority Newborns Scheme). In addition, around 6 000 applications were received from one-person applicants.

  It is the first time the HA has allocated an extra ballot number to applicants who failed to purchase an SSF in the last two consecutive sale exercises of the same type of SSF, with the aim of increasing their chances of successfully purchasing SSFs. Approximately 12 000 applications for the GSH 2024 have been allocated an additional ballot number.

Sequence of priority for flat selections (see Annex 2)

  The sequence of priority for flat selections by eligible applicants is determined by the application category, quota allocation and ballot results. Affected tenants of the HA's announced PRH clearance projects (i.e. Pik Hoi House, Kam Pik House and Tan Fung House of Choi Hung Estate, and Wah On House and Wah Lok House of Wah Fu Estate) who would like to purchase an SSF in lieu of PRH will be accorded priority in flat selections over other applicants under the GSH 2024. Separately, the HA has set a quota of 1 050 flats for families applying under the Priority Elderly Scheme and the Priority Newborns Scheme; and a quota of 250 flats for one-person applicants."

香港房屋委員會（房委會）「出售綠表置居計劃（綠置居）單位2024」（「綠置居2024」）將於十一月二十六日開始選樓。房委會將會按申請類別的優先次序，分批發信或電郵邀請合資格申請者在指定時間前往觀塘房委會綠置居銷售小組辦事處（綠置居售樓處）選購「綠置居2024」推售的單位。

房委會發言人今日（十一月十八日）說：「房委會一直以來致力完善房屋階梯，透過推出各項資助出售單位計劃及持續優化相關安排，協助經濟能力較佳的公共租住房屋（公屋）租戶購買資助出售單位，達至向上流動之效。「綠置居2024」的選樓環節即將展開，我們鼓勵有能力的公屋住戶把握機會，早日達成置業願望。」

推售單位

「綠置居2024」推售的單位包括位於九龍灣宏緻苑共2 576個新綠置居單位，實用面積介乎約17.9平方米至約43.3平方米（約193平方呎至約466平方呎），有超過25%為大單位，實用面積約41.8平方米至約43.3平方米（約450平方呎至約466平方呎）（見附件一）。此外，「綠置居2024」亦會推售約270個重售綠置居單位以及新一批約350個租者置其屋計劃（租置計劃）回收單位。

發言人說：「在『綠置居2024』選樓期開始前七日起（即十一月十九日）直至選樓期結束期間，我們會提供售樓說明書（及為租置計劃回收單位提供售樓小冊子）和價單，於綠置居售樓處供公眾索取，以及在房委會／房屋署的指定網站（www.housingauthority.gov.hk/gsh/2024）瀏覽。」

綠置居售樓處和指定網站亦會提供新建發展項目的模型及綠置居標準單位的室內間格模型、綠置居樣本單位的虛擬短片、綠置居樣本單位及租置計劃樣本回收單位的室內虛擬實境導覽、綠置居發展項目及租置計劃屋邨的展板及其他資料，供公眾閱覽。

於選樓期內，綠置居售樓處和指定網站亦會提供所有本期推售的租置計劃回收單位的室內短片。房委會會盡力在可行的情況下，與相關持份者作出安排，協助買家視察在「綠置居2024」下出售的租置計劃回收單位。

定價

房委會繼續以可負擔水平來釐定綠置居單位的售價，「綠置居2024」的折扣率為較早前完成的「出售居者有其屋計劃單位2024」（「居屋2024」）的折扣率高10%。「居屋2024」的折扣率定於評定市值折減30%（七折），是以申請人的負擔能力為基礎，即至少有75%推售的單位可讓入息水平達家庭每月入息中位數的非業主住戶家庭，動用不超過其每月入息的40%作按揭供款。按照以負擔能力為基礎的定價政策，「綠置居2024」推售的綠置居單位定於評定市值折減40%，即以六折出售。宏緻苑單位的售價介乎約115萬元至約349萬元，平均售價大約為247萬元。

發言人説：「按照約247萬元的單位平均售價計算（實用面積約34平方米或約366平方呎），假設按揭貸款與單位售價比例為95%、按揭還款期30年，並以現行按揭利率約3.5%計算，每月按揭還款額大約10,500元。至於一至二人單位，單位的平均售價約為128萬元，每月按揭還款額約5,500元。」

申請數目

在申請期內，房委會共收到約三萬六千份「綠置居2024」申請表。所有申請中，約三萬份屬家庭申請者類別，當中參加「家有長者優先選樓計劃」及「家有初生優先選樓計劃」共有約一萬六千份，另外約六千份申請屬一人申請者類別。

此外，房委會首次為前兩次連續申請同一類別資助出售單位銷售計劃而未能購得單位的申請者分派多一個抽籤號碼，以增加他們成功購買資助出售單位的機會。今期「綠置居2024」約有一萬二千份的申請獲發額外抽籤號碼。

選樓的優先次序（見附件二）

合資格申請者選樓的優先次序按申請類別、配額比例和攪珠結果釐定。受房委會已公布公屋清拆計劃影響的租戶（即彩虹邨碧海樓、金碧樓和丹鳳樓，以及華富邨華安樓和華樂樓），若選擇購買資助出售單位以代替入住公屋，可在「綠置居2024」較其他申請者優先選樓。此外，房委會已為參加「家有長者優先選樓計劃」及「家有初生優先選樓計劃」的家庭申請者設定1 050個單位的配額；及為一人申請者預留250個單位的配額。"

Powered by holographic projection and cutting-edge technology, the production explores what it truly means to coexist across cultures in a chaotic world. ""Strangely Familiar"", one of the programmes of the Asia+ Festival 2025, presented by the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and organised by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, is also part of the East Kowloon Cultural Centre's opening season lineup.

  Directed by Kuik, ""Strangely Familiar"" unites a team from Singapore and Malaysia along with Hong Kong and Macao artists in a bold attempt to dissolve the boundaries between cultures, identities and realities. By letting go of labels and assumptions, the work opens space for a shared humanity that feels strange yet familiar amidst different cultures. Part of the content was filmed in Hong Kong and Macao, blending with different soundscapes including Southeast Asian elements, traditional instruments, synthesisers and also human voice to create a highly anticipated new creation. Tan will also appear with a virtual presence, inviting the audience to rethink connection, presence, and existence across both physical and digital realms.

  T.H.E Dance Company is lauded for its distinctive choreographic voice. Its 2011 production, ""As It Fades"", was hailed as a landmark in Asia's contemporary dance scene. Now, in this new commission by Asia+ Festival and the Singapore International Festival of Arts, the company unveils the world premiere of ""Strangely Familiar"" in Hong Kong - a thought-provoking encounter not to be missed.

  ""Strangely Familiar"" will be staged at 8pm on November 28, at 3pm and 8pm on November 29, and at 2pm and 6pm on November 30 at The Turns of the East Kowloon Cultural Centre, with tickets priced at $500. There will be a meet-the-artist session after each performance.

  In addition, a dance workshop priced at $240 will be held on November 30 from 10am to 11.30am at Incubator 2 of the East Kowloon Cultural Centre, with Kuik Swee Boon as the instructor.

Mr Robin Harding (Asia Editor for the Financial Times), Daryl (Chairman of the Sino Group, Mr Daryl Ng), Consuls-General, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is a pleasure to join you at this conference, a gathering of policymakers, distinguished business leaders and innovators, to explore Hong Kong's evolving role in the global economy.

  I'm sure that by the end of today's discussions, you will appreciate Hong Kong more and recognise the enduring value we bring to the world.

  In considering Hong Kong's role in the changing global economy, allow me to highlight our two major development priorities: strengthening our position as an international financial centre and advancing innovation and technology.

Hong Kong as a rising IFC

  First, geopolitical developments are elevating - rather than diminishing - Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre (IFC). As you may recall, the opening months of 2025 were marked by significant policy shifts in the United States (US), bringing a new level of uncertainty to the global markets. In the wake of the turbulent Liberation Day saga, investors around the world responded with heightened caution, reassessing risks and recalibrating their strategies.

  And consider this data: gold prices have surged by over 55 per cent this year, reflecting heightened risk aversion. Bitcoin had once soared by more than 110 per cent, demonstrating demand for alternative stores of value. The equity markets in the US boomed - for instance, the S&P 500 rose by around 14 per cent, but the US dollar depreciated by around 10 per cent, with 10-year Treasury yields having fallen by more than 60 basis points.

  What do these tell us? They revealed that amid heighted policy uncertainty and market volatility, investors are seeking safe havens. In this process, they look for transparent, consistent and stable policy environments, and value jurisdictions with familiar legal systems and trusted regulatory frameworks.

  They, of course, continue to pursue returns. Yes, Hong Kong is the answer. At the start of this year, the average P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) of Hong Kong stocks were only around 12. And when the DeepSeek moment highlighted China's technological strength and cost efficiency, global investors quickly realised they had underallocated to this region.

  Indeed, this wave of global investor interest has translated into significant capital flow into our market. The Hang Seng Index has surged by over 30 per cent year-to-date, following an 18 per cent gain last year, with an average daily turnover more than doubled that of last year. IPO (initial public offering) fundraising reached approximately US$28 billion as of October, making Hong Kong the global leader in new listings so far this year. Follow-on fundraising has been even stronger, reaching US$61 billion in the same period.

  The asset and wealth management industry is also experiencing robust growth, with strong capital inflows. In the first eight months of this year, Hong Kong-domiciled funds recorded net inflows of US$43 billion.

  Bank deposits have increased by 10 per cent so far this year, reaching over US$2.4 trillion.

  Financial institutions have responded accordingly, with many expanding their operations in the city. We are seeing leading financial firms leasing larger office spaces, and in the case of some fintech companies, even acquiring entire building blocks.

  Going forward, geo-economic reconfiguration is accelerating regional economic co-operation and advancing trade and investment within blocs. We are witnessing growing momentum in initiatives such as FTA (free trade agreement) 3.0 between China and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), as well as the expanding corridors of collaboration with the Middle East. Within these, Hong Kong plays a pivotal and strategic role - connecting markets, channelling capital, matching businesses, and providing professional expertise.

  On capital markets, bilateral cross-border collaboration is gaining significant traction. Hong Kong's deepening cross-border collaboration with the Middle East is a compelling case in point. Over the past few years, we have worked closely with Saudi's Tadawul to facilitate the mutual listing of ETFs (exchange-traded funds) on each other's market. We then strengthened cross-border regulatory collaboration to pave the way for dual listings. Last week, we marked a historic milestone by welcoming the first Middle Eastern company to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

  Indeed, our collaboration extends beyond finance into the industrial and commercial sectors. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia will soon jointly launch a US$1 billion fund to support Hong Kong and Greater Bay Area companies to expand into Saudi Arabia, contributing to the development of non-oil economic sectors in Saudi Arabia. Next month, a major Saudi development company will be hosting a roadshow in Hong Kong to seek strategic partners and professional service providers to support their infrastructure development.

Innovation and technology

  The second major development direction for Hong Kong is innovation and technology - our new engine of growth.

  Our strategy focuses on sectors where we hold a competitive advantage: artificial intelligence (AI), biotech, fintech, as well as new energy and new materials.

  To realise this vision, several key elements are essential: cutting-edge technology, technology enterprises, talent, market, land resources and capital.

  On the enterprise front, we have established the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES), dedicated to bringing in high-impact, high-potential tech companies engaged in frontier technologies. Over the past three years, we have attracted over 100 such enterprises, many of which are global leaders in their respective fields. Collectively, these companies are expected to invest around US$8 billion in Hong Kong, creating about 22 000 quality jobs. Many are now setting up R&D (research and development) centres or regional headquarters in this city, often bringing with them upstream and downstream partners, thereby further enriching our innovation ecosystem.

  We have established the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, HKIC, as patient capital, to help us realise this vision. I'm sure Clara (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, Ms Clara Chan) will share more on this at the upcoming panel session.

  In terms of land resources, the Northern Metropolis will be the carrier of our vision for innovation and technology. It also functions as a strategic base for collaboration with other Greater Bay Area cities, in particular Shenzhen. We are accelerating its development through innovative policies and tailor-made incentive packages. The goal is to anchor leading technology companies here to build a vibrant ecosystem so that our vision in innovation and technology will be deeply ingrained with industry development.

  Speaking of the Greater Bay Area, there is an additional advantage that few regions can match. It is where high-end manufacturing capabilities and cutting-edge AI innovation simultaneously reside. AI technology can be directly and seamlessly applied, tested and validated in real-world industrial settings.

  On talent, Hong Kong continues to be a magnet for global professionals. Since the launch of new and enhanced talent admission schemes at the end of 2022, we have received over 550 000 applications, approved more than 370 000, and more than 250 000 individuals have already arrived.

  In fact, amid the geopolitical landscape, we have recently welcomed hundreds of scholars, researchers and world-renowned academics. And outstanding students are on their way here too. Here in Hong Kong, we believe that intellectual excellence knows no borders. We welcome the world's brightest minds to our city where merit - not politics - defines opportunity.

Concluding remarks

  Ladies and gentlemen, in short, Hong Kong is accelerating its role as both an international financial centre and a premier global innovation hub. Few cities in the world can lead in these dimensions simultaneously - and with such momentum.

  I wish you all a rewarding summit, and good health and continued success in the time ahead. Thank you very much."

We then strengthened cross-border regulatory collaboration to pave the way for dual listings. Last week, we marked a historic milestone by welcoming the first Middle Eastern company to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

  Indeed, our collaboration extends beyond finance into the industrial and commercial sectors. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia will soon jointly launch a US$1 billion fund to support Hong Kong and Greater Bay Area companies to expand into Saudi Arabia, contributing to the development of non-oil economic sectors in Saudi Arabia. Next month, a major Saudi development company will be hosting a roadshow in Hong Kong to seek strategic partners and professional service providers to support their infrastructure development.

Innovation and technology

  The second major development direction for Hong Kong is innovation and technology - our new engine of growth.

  Our strategy focuses on sectors where we hold a competitive advantage: artificial intelligence (AI), biotech, fintech, as well as new energy and new materials.

  To realise this vision, several key elements are essential: cutting-edge technology, technology enterprises, talent, market, land resources and capital.

  On the enterprise front, we have established the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES), dedicated to bringing in high-impact, high-potential tech companies engaged in frontier technologies. Over the past three years, we have attracted over 100 such enterprises, many of which are global leaders in their respective fields. Collectively, these companies are expected to invest around US$8 billion in Hong Kong, creating about 22 000 quality jobs. Many are now setting up R&D (research and development) centres or regional headquarters in this city, often bringing with them upstream and downstream partners, thereby further enriching our innovation ecosystem.

  We have established the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, HKIC, as patient capital, to help us realise this vision. I'm sure Clara (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, Ms Clara Chan) will share more on this at the upcoming panel session.

  In terms of land resources, the Northern Metropolis will be the carrier of our vision for innovation and technology. It also functions as a strategic base for collaboration with other Greater Bay Area cities, in particular Shenzhen. We are accelerating its development through innovative policies and tailor-made incentive packages. The goal is to anchor leading technology companies here to build a vibrant ecosystem so that our vision in innovation and technology will be deeply ingrained with industry development.

  Speaking of the Greater Bay Area, there is an additional advantage that few regions can match. It is where high-end manufacturing capabilities and cutting-edge AI innovation simultaneously reside. AI technology can be directly and seamlessly applied, tested and validated in real-world industrial settings.

  On talent, Hong Kong continues to be a magnet for global professionals. Since the launch of new and enhanced talent admission schemes at the end of 2022, we have received over 550 000 applications, approved more than 370 000, and more than 250 000 individuals have already arrived.

  In fact, amid the geopolitical landscape, we have recently welcomed hundreds of scholars, researchers and world-renowned academics. And outstanding students are on their way here too. Here in Hong Kong, we believe that intellectual excellence knows no borders. We welcome the world's brightest minds to our city where merit - not politics - defines opportunity.

Concluding remarks

  Ladies and gentlemen, in short, Hong Kong is accelerating its role as both an international financial centre and a premier global innovation hub. Few cities in the world can lead in these dimensions simultaneously - and with such momentum.

  I wish you all a rewarding summit, and good health and continued success in the time ahead. Thank you very much."

"Denmark theatre troupe Teater Katapult to make Hong Kong debut with award-winning work ""The Insider"" in December (with photos) ",2025-11-18 11:30,2025-11-18 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800253.htm,"  Denmark theatre troupe Teater Katapult will perform in Hong Kong for the first time with their solo play ""The Insider"" at the Leisure and Cultural Services Department's ""European Theatres in Resonance"" in December. The work is based on the German State's crown witness in the real international case of dividend tax fraud. Combining live acting with visuals and a binaural soundscape, it is aimed at giving audiences a sensually thrilling immersive theatrical experience.

  ""The Insider"" is inspired by the ""Cum-Ex scandal"", a real international case of dividend tax fraud involving an amount as high as 53 billion euros, causing a stir among many European countries. The story is about a young father and tax lawyer who works in one of the world's largest banks. As an ambitious freshman with an ingenious interpretation of the tax laws, he begins to exploit the benefits from a loophole in the financial system, leading to a bloodbath of state treasury looting. Nonetheless, he makes his pivotal shift in allegiance later to assist the police in dismantling an extensive network of criminal accomplices.

  The production is directed by Johan Sarauw and stars Christoffer Hvidberg Rønje. With headphones on throughout the performance, audiences will experience the extraordinary 3D binaural sound, cinematic sound, and the voices of multiple characters, going into the inner world of the mastermind with an immersive sensory experience, as well as experiencing his personal journey. Simultaneously, Rønje will solely perform inside a glass cubicle on the stage, showcasing the emotional changes through his physical movements and facial expressions. Accompanied by the transforming scenes with evolving video projections on the glass box, audiences will be guided to travel around the world to follow the case, enhancing the dramatic tension of the play while exploring the human face of greed. The production won the Scotsman Fringe First award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2023 and garnered acclaim during tours across Europe and in Korea.

  Teater Katapult was founded in Denmark by the present Artistic & Managing Director, Torben Dahl, in 1995. It is based on the idea to challenge people through the arts. The main goal is to make people more conscious of themselves and the world around them, and at the same time feel moved through both their senses and intellect. The company has two theatre spaces in Aarhus. They develop, produce, and present new contemporary drama, and present works by Danish as well as international companies.

  ""The Insider"" by Teater Katapult (Denmark) will be held at 8pm on December 19 and 20 (Friday and Saturday), and at 3pm on December 20 and 21 (Saturday and Sunday) at the Studio Theatre of the Hong Kong Cultural Centre. The programme will be conducted in English with Chinese and English surtitles. Tickets priced at $320 and $420 are now available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288. The ""European Theatres in Resonance"" also includes ""Songs of Lear"" by Song of the Goat Theatre (Poland) to be held from February 6 to 8 next year. A discount will be offered for those purchasing standard tickets of both performances of ""The Insider"" and ""Songs of Lear"". For programme enquiries and concessionary schemes, please call 2268 7325 or visit www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/Programme/en/theatre/programs_1925.html. The programme contains inappropriate language and is recommended for people aged 16 and above.

DH reminds public to use antibiotics properly in support of World Antimicrobial Resistance Awareness Week,2025-11-18 11:28,2025-11-18 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800248.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 18) called on healthcare professionals and members of the public to take collective action against antimicrobial resistance (AMR), in support of World Antimicrobial Awareness Week 2025. Antimicrobials are medications used to treat infections, including antibiotics, which are specifically used to treat bacterial infections. AMR occurs when microorganisms (such as bacteria and viruses) adapt to grow in an environment with antimicrobials, rendering previously effective medications ineffective. Misuse and inappropriate use of antibiotics are the primary causes of AMR. The Government has been placing great importance on combating AMR. In 2022, the Government published the second Hong Kong Strategy and Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, outlining strategies to tackle the threat of AMR from 2023 to 2027.Key measures include reviewing and updating the antimicrobial guidelines entitled the Interhospital Multi-disciplinary Programme on Antimicrobial ChemoTherapy (IMPACT), and promoting the guidelines to doctors to prescribe antimicrobials to patients in accordance with scientific evidence.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated November 18 to 24 every year as World Antimicrobial Resistance Awareness Week. This year's theme is ""Act Now: Protect Our Present, Secure Our Future"".

""AMR is one of the world's most serious public health challenges. When bacteria and viruses develop resistance, infections become harder to treat or even untreatable. In 2021, about 4.71 million deaths worldwide were associated with drug-resistant bacteria. If we fail to act, this figure is projected to rise to 8.22 million deaths annually by 2050. The WHO estimates that between 2020 and 2030, 18 433 deaths in Hong Kong will be AMR-related. To help the public better understand the affected lives behind these statistics, the CHP produced a video featuring a local survivor sharing his personal experience of how AMR nearly cost him his life. This highlights that AMR is not a distant global issue, but a threat that could affect anyone,"" said the Consultant (Antimicrobial Resistance) of the Centre for Health Protection (CHP), Dr Edmond Ma.

Updating antimicrobial guidelines for doctors' reference
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Government will continue to implement the Action Plan comprehensively to integrate human, animal, and environmental health efforts under the One Health framework.

""In June this year, the CHP launched the sixth edition of the IMPACT guidelines, which provide recommendations on prescriptions for different infections, serving as a reference for all doctors in Hong Kong when prescribing antimicrobial drugs to inpatients. The CHP also promoted appropriate prescribing practices in line with the IMPACT guidelines through a professional forum and a letter to doctors. The corresponding mobile application (September 2025 version) is now available on both iOS and Android platforms for the convenience of medical professionals,"" said Dr Ma.

He noted that Antimicrobial Stewardship Programmes have been implemented across public and private hospitals. The latest surveillance data reflected an improvement in prescribing practices. The proportion of antimicrobials in the Watch category (i.e. antimicrobials considered by the WHO to be at a higher risk of developing drug resistance) in the total supply of antimicrobials in Hong Kong decreased from 40.3 per cent in 2016 to 34.6 per cent in 2024. This indicated that doctors were prescribing fewer broad-spectrum antibiotics, which helped address the issue of AMR.

Strengthening crackdown on illegal sale of antimicrobials
----------------------------------------------------------------

To safeguard antimicrobial efficacy, the DH has stepped up efforts in combating the illegal sale of antimicrobials. According to the surveillance data, the wholesale supply of antimicrobials to community pharmacies has steadily decreased from 18.5 per cent in 2016 to 3.4 per cent in 2024. Furthermore, through the CHP's ongoing public education initiatives, public awareness of AMR has improved. According to the survey conducted by the CHP in 2024, 70.9 per cent of the public are aware of the term ""antibiotic resistance"", and the vast majority of respondents (96.3 per cent) indicated that their last course of antibiotics was prescribed by a doctor, reflecting an increased awareness of proper medicine use. Moreover, elderly respondents showed improved knowledge about drug resistance, showing the effectiveness of the publicity efforts.

Nevertheless, the survey also found that approximately one-quarter of respondents (25.6 per cent) were unaware that consuming raw or undercooked food increases the risk of infection from microorganisms, including drug-resistant bacteria. Furthermore, a rising trend in drug-resistant bacteria has been detected in ready-to-eat foods (RTE). According to the data from tests commissioned by the CHP, the proportion of Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) (a type of drug-resistant bacteria) rose from 5.9 per cent in 2018/19 to 13.3 per cent in 2023/24 among RTE food samples. The increase was particularly pronounced in RTE vegetables (36.7 per cent), lo mei (20.0 per cent), pre-cut fruits (16.3 per cent) and siu mei (14.3 per cent).

The CHP urged members of the public to work with healthcare professionals to eliminate AMR by observing the following:


Antibiotics are effective only in treating bacterial infections, not viral infections such as influenza and COVID-19. When you have an upper respiratory tract infection, consult a doctor. Do not buy or consume antibiotics from community pharmacies on your own;
Do not demand antibioticsfrom doctors. Only take antibiotics when advised by a doctor and complete the entire course of treatment, even if symptoms improve;
Follow the health advice stated on the prescription bag and adopt appropriate infection control measures, such as maintaining hand hygiene, wearing a surgical mask when having respiratory symptoms, and disinfecting and covering all wounds properly to prevent person-to-person spread of drug-resistant bacteria when taking antibiotics;
Receive seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccines to prevent secondary bacterial infections, thereby reducing the use of antibiotics and avoiding the occurrence of AMR;
Be aware of the risk of acquiring drug-resistant bacteria from RTE food. People taking antibiotics or antacids, and high-risk populations (such as pregnant women, infants and young children, the elderly and people with weakened immunity) are at a higher risk and should avoid eating raw or undercooked RTE foods; and
Observe good hygienic practices in the kitchen when handling food to minimise the risk of cross-contamination by drug-resistant bacteria.

衞生署呼籲市民響應「世界抗菌素耐藥性關注周」善用抗生素,2025-11-18 11:28,2025-11-18 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800249.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月十八日）呼籲醫護人員及市民共同採取行動，對抗抗菌素耐藥性，以響應二○二五年「世界抗菌素耐藥性關注周」。抗菌素是用於治療感染的藥物，其中包括專用於對抗細菌感染的抗生素。抗菌素耐藥性，是指微生物（如細菌、病毒）適應了在有抗菌素的環境下生長，對過去有效的藥物不再有反應。濫用和不當使用抗生素的行為是導致耐藥性問題的主因。政府一直高度重視應對抗菌素耐藥性，於二○二二年發表第二份《香港抗菌素耐藥性策略及行動計劃》（《行動計劃》），為二○二三年至二○二七年制訂應對抗菌素耐藥性威脅而採取的策略，工作措施包括檢討和更新名為《效果》的抗菌素指引，並推廣該指引以供醫生基於實證為病人處方抗菌素。

世界衞生組織（世衞）將每年十一月十八日至二十四日定為「世界抗菌素耐藥性關注周」，今年的主題為「立即行動：守護當下，保障未來」。

中心顧問醫生（抗菌素耐藥性）馬紹強醫生說：「抗菌素耐藥性是全球最嚴峻的公共衞生挑戰之一。當細菌或病毒產生耐藥性，將導致感染變得更難甚至無法治愈。於二○二一年，全球約有471萬人的死亡與抗菌素耐藥性細菌有關。若不採取行動，預計到二○五○年，每年相關死亡人數將達822萬。而世衞估算二○二○至二○三○年間，本港將有18 433宗死亡個案與抗菌素耐藥性相關。為了讓市民更具體感受這些統計數字背後反映的是受影響的生命，中心製作了影片，邀請一位本地的倖存者現身說法，親述抗菌素耐藥性如何讓他險些喪命，突顯了這並非遙不可及的全球議題，而是可能發生在任何人身上的威脅。」

更新抗菌素指引供醫生參考
————————————

政府將繼續全面推動《行動計劃》，以「一體化」方針整合人類、動物及環境衞生的工作。

馬紹強醫生說：「今年六月，中心推出第六版《效果》，就不同感染情況提供用藥建議，讓全港醫生為住院病人處方抗菌藥物時作為參考。中心並透過專業論壇及發信，向醫生推廣參考《效果》適切處方。同步更新的流動應用程式（二○二五年九月版）已於iOS及Android平台上架，方便醫護查閱。」

他指出，不論公營或私營的醫院亦已推行「抗生素導向計劃」，最新監測數據顯示抗菌素處方模式有所改善：本港「謹慎使用類」抗菌素（世衞認定為較大機會引發耐藥性的抗菌素）佔全港抗菌素的供應量，從二○一六年的40.3%降至二○二四年的34.6%，顯示醫生相對較少處方廣譜抗生素，有助應對抗菌素耐藥性的問題。

加強打擊非法銷售抗菌素
———————————

為保障抗菌素的效用，衞生署積極加強打擊非法銷售抗菌素。監測數據顯示社區藥房抗菌素批發供應量從二○一六年的18.5%持續下降至二○二四年的3.4%。此外，在中心不斷加強公眾教育，市民對耐藥性認知有所提升。根據中心於二○二四年進行的調查顯示，市民對「抗生素耐藥性」的認知度達70.9%；絕大部分（96.3%）市民表示，最近使用的抗生素經醫生處方，反映正確用藥意識提升。此外，長者群組對耐藥性的認知度亦有所進步，充分彰顯宣傳的成效。

然而，調查亦發現約四分之一受訪者（25.6%）不知道進食生或未經煮熟食物會增加微生物感染風險（包括耐藥性細菌）。此外，即食食品中的耐藥性細菌呈上升趨勢。根據中心委託機構進行檢測所得的數據，超廣譜β-內酰胺酶耐藥性腸道桿菌（一種耐藥性細菌）在即食食品樣本中的檢出率從二○一八／一九年度的5.9%上升至二○二三／二四年度的13.3%，其中供生吃的即食蔬菜（36.7%）、滷味（20.0%）、預先切開的水果（16.3%）及燒味（14.3%）的上升尤其顯著。

中心呼籲市民遵照以下建議，與醫護人員合力消弭抗菌素耐藥性的問題：

• 抗生素僅對細菌感染有效，而對病毒性感染（如流感、2019冠狀病毒病）則無效。若有上呼吸道感染，應就醫，切勿自行到藥房購買抗生素服用；
• 不要向醫生要求抗生素。只有在醫生建議下，才服用抗生素，並須完成整個療程。即使症狀有所改善，也不應自行停用抗生素；
• 留意和遵循藥物袋上註明的注意事項，採取適當的感染控制措施，例如經常保持手部衞生、出現呼吸道症狀時佩戴外科口罩、妥善消毒和覆蓋所有傷口，以防止服用抗生素時耐藥菌以「人傳人」方式傳播；
• 接種季節性流感疫苗和2019冠狀病毒病疫苗，以預防繼發性細菌感染，從而減少使用抗生素，避免出現抗菌素耐藥性；
• 注意從即食食品中感染抗藥性細菌的風險。服用抗生素或抗酸劑的人，以及高危人士（例如孕婦、嬰幼兒、長者和免疫力弱的人），應避免食用生或未經徹底煮熟的即食食品；及
• 在廚房處理食物時，應保持良好的衞生習慣，減少耐藥性細菌交叉感染的風險。

Government launches Pilot Manufacturing and Production Line Upgrade Support Scheme and enhances existing New Industrialisation Acceleration Scheme,2025-11-18 11:00,2025-11-18 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111700438.htm,"The Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC) today (November 18) launched the Pilot Manufacturing and Production Line Upgrade Support Scheme (Manufacturing+) under the New Industrialisation Support Scheme of the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) and enhanced the existing New Industrialisation Acceleration Scheme (NIAS) to further drive the development of new industrialisation in Hong Kong.

""By launching Manufacturing+ and enhancing the existing NIAS, the Government aims to promote new industrialisation and foster diversified economic development. Announced in this year's Budget, Manufacturing+ seeks to encourage local manufacturing enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises with no prior experience in smart production investment, to adopt smart production technologies and upgrade their production lines, thereby driving the development of new quality productive forces. As well, the Chief Executive announced in this year's Policy Address that the application threshold for the NIAS will be relaxed and funding would be provided on a matching basis for enterprises to employ relevant technical personnel. This will help attract more enterprises engaging in strategic industries to set up new smart production facilities in Hong Kong, driving high value-added advanced manufacturing,"" a spokesman for the Commission said.

The spokesperson continued, ""The Government will proactively leverage innovation and technology to drive high valueâadded manufacturing, promote new industrialisation, and remain committed to providing timely and appropriate support to relevant enterprises.""

Under Manufacturing+, the Government will provide funding of up to $250,000 per eligible enterprise on a 1 (Government): 2 (enterprise) matching basis to enterprises operating production lines in Hong Kong to assist them to formulate smart production strategies and introduce advanced technologies into existing production lines. The funding scope covers relevant consultancy fees, costs for purchasing equipment and integrating smart technologies into existing production lines, as well as training and development expenses. To ensure effective use of resources, Manufacturing+ will be overseen by the Committee on Technology Adoption and Production Line Upgrade, with the Hong Kong Productivity Council serving as its Secretariat.

In addition, the application threshold for the NIAS will also be relaxed, with the minimum total project cost lowered from $300 million to $150 million. Enterprises shall contribute no less than $100 million while the matching ratio of 1(Government) to 2 (enterprise) remains unchanged. Moreover, the ITC will also provide funding on a 1(Government) to 1 (enterprise) basis for companies approved under the NIAS to employ up to 10 technical personnel required for setting up or operating smart production facilities.

Manufacturing+ and the NIAS accept applications year-round. Details are available on the Innovation and Technology Fund website (www.itf.gov.hk). For enquiries, please contact the Secretariat of the schemes (Tel: 35435904; email:enquiry@itf.gov.hk)."

Honarable Doctor Zhao Zhimin (Secretary-General of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences), Nobel laureate Professor Joseph Stiglitz, (University Professor of Columbia University; Nobel Memorial Prize Laureate in Economic Sciences), distinguished speakers, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. Welcome to Hong Kong, and to the International Forum on China's Economy and Policy 2025.

 My thanks, first of all, to the organisers affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: the National Academy of Economic Strategy and the Chinese Institute of Hong Kong; to the co-organisers from three universities in Hong Kong; and to all the heavyweight speakers here today.

 This forum is convened by the Chief Executive's Policy Unit, which is my think tank responsible for research and engagement on long-term, strategic issues.

 It works closely with academia and other think tanks, contributing rigorous analyses and innovative ideas that enhance Hong Kong's economic resilience and ongoing vibrancy. It is precisely this mission that makes this forum so valuable to us.

 I understand that nearly 500 of you are here with us to discuss this year's theme: ""Economic Transformations in a Multipolar World"". Given today's complex global economy, it's a particularly timely topic.

 The forum, and its expert speakers, will examine the challenges facing today's global economy. It will assess China's economic strategy and the sustainable development model for regional economic co-operation. To contribute to that discussion, I would like to share three main points with you today.

 First, China, our country, is solidly on a path of high-quality development, creating a stable platform for global growth.

 In the face of the global economy's distressing instability – the rise of protectionism and unilateralism – our country continues its focus on high-quality development, achieving groundbreaking progress.

 The world's second-largest economy, our country contributes more than one-third of global economic growth. China's expanding trade and capital flows help buoy the economy of the region and the world at large. Its fundamentals remain sound, thanks to a vast domestic market and the robust policies in place to withstand external challenges.

 This year marks the conclusion of our country's 14th Five-Year Plan, and preparation for the 15th Five-Year Plan is well underway.

 The fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China concluded last month, in Beijing, setting a key objective for the next five years, among other goals, to achieve significant advancements in high-quality development, with fresh policy pledges poised to reaffirm the country as a crucial anchor of stability and a source of opportunities for the global economy.

 Second, as a part of this national endeavour, the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) is proud to contribute with its own unique advantages.

 Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong enjoys the dual advantage of having both national and global opportunities. Despite the chaos in the global economy, Hong Kong's third-quarter performance was robust, thanks to a continuing surge in exports and sustained expansion in domestic demand.

 Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy should see further solid growth, supported by sustained moderate global economic growth, vibrant financial market activity, interest rate cuts in the US (United States), a continued increase in visitor arrivals, and so on.

 In fact, Hong Kong has long shone as a resilient and resourceful economy, one of the world's most competitive in the many sectors we commit to. Confidence is getting stronger and stronger. And the world has recognised our achievements.

 This year's World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Hong Kong third in the world, up two places from last year. The Fraser Institute once again ranked Hong Kong as the world's freest economy, number one, and we placed third in the latest Global Financial Centres Index, just two points back of New York, one behind London – and tops in Asia.

 These, and other international kudos, highlight our economic strengths, long supported by the rule of law and a common law system that dovetails with most global financial hubs. That provides the critical assurances investors demand and take confidence in.

 Our determination to build on these strengths is reflected in the theme of my Policy Address this year: ""Deepening Reforms for Our People, Leveraging Our Strengths for a Brighter Future"". It serves as a roadmap for our economic progress, our pursuit of diversified development, and our determination to improve the livelihood of the people of Hong Kong. In doing so, I am confident we will accelerate our advancement from stability to prosperity.

 This brings me to my third point. Hong Kong's unparalleled advantages are not just for our own benefit – they equip us to play a critical role in global economic transformations.

 In these times of economic uncertainty, Hong Kong remains a financial harbour wide open to the world, to free and unfettered trade, thanks to our role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", building bridges for a world of mutual opportunity.

 We hold fast to the belief that free trade is the answer to boosting global output – the critical element in creating a more interconnected, productive and peaceful world economy.

 This belief is put into practice through our role as the paramount destination both for Chinese companies looking to access offshore capital and for the world seeking the Chinese Mainland's deep capital market.

 As of last year, more than 2 600 Chinese Mainland enterprises had established operations in Hong Kong. Our Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global, launched last month, will co-ordinate efforts to help mainland enterprises connect, more efficiently, with global markets and buyers, taking advantage of our world-class financial and professional services.

 As an international financial, shipping and trade centre, Hong Kong has the infrastructure and services to support international trade at the highest levels. Our ports, airports and logistics systems boost trade flow efficiency, supporting cross-boundary e-commerce and supply chains designed for the flourishing future we are surely building.

 Hong Kong, after all, is China's most internationalised city. We offer the world a market-friendly business environment, replete with business and investment advantages unmatched by any other city anywhere in the world. We are working now, proactively, to align ourselves with the 15th Five-Year Plan, fulfil Hong Kong's responsibilities and seize the plentiful opportunities there for us – for all of us.

 Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is ready to contribute to the ""economic transformations"" you will discuss. I wish you all a rewarding forum, the best of business in the coming year, and an enjoyable stay in our Asia's world city - Hong Kong. Thank you."

Honarable Doctor Zhao Zhimin (Secretary-General of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences), Nobel laureate Professor Joseph Stiglitz, (University Professor of Columbia University; Nobel Memorial Prize Laureate in Economic Sciences), distinguished speakers, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. Welcome to Hong Kong, and to the International Forum on China's Economy and Policy 2025.

 My thanks, first of all, to the organisers affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: the National Academy of Economic Strategy and the Chinese Institute of Hong Kong; to the co-organisers from three universities in Hong Kong; and to all the heavyweight speakers here today.

 This forum is convened by the Chief Executive's Policy Unit, which is my think tank responsible for research and engagement on long-term, strategic issues.

 It works closely with academia and other think tanks, contributing rigorous analyses and innovative ideas that enhance Hong Kong's economic resilience and ongoing vibrancy. It is precisely this mission that makes this forum so valuable to us.

 I understand that nearly 500 of you are here with us to discuss this year's theme: ""Economic Transformations in a Multipolar World"". Given today's complex global economy, it's a particularly timely topic.

 The forum, and its expert speakers, will examine the challenges facing today's global economy. It will assess China's economic strategy and the sustainable development model for regional economic co-operation. To contribute to that discussion, I would like to share three main points with you today.

 First, China, our country, is solidly on a path of high-quality development, creating a stable platform for global growth.

 In the face of the global economy's distressing instability – the rise of protectionism and unilateralism – our country continues its focus on high-quality development, achieving groundbreaking progress.

 The world's second-largest economy, our country contributes more than one-third of global economic growth. China's expanding trade and capital flows help buoy the economy of the region and the world at large. Its fundamentals remain sound, thanks to a vast domestic market and the robust policies in place to withstand external challenges.

 This year marks the conclusion of our country's 14th Five-Year Plan, and preparation for the 15th Five-Year Plan is well underway.

 The fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China concluded last month, in Beijing, setting a key objective for the next five years, among other goals, to achieve significant advancements in high-quality development, with fresh policy pledges poised to reaffirm the country as a crucial anchor of stability and a source of opportunities for the global economy.

 Second, as a part of this national endeavour, the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) is proud to contribute with its own unique advantages.

 Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong enjoys the dual advantage of having both national and global opportunities. Despite the chaos in the global economy, Hong Kong's third-quarter performance was robust, thanks to a continuing surge in exports and sustained expansion in domestic demand.

Honourable Deputy Commissioner Hua You of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Honourable Mr John Zhao (Chairman of China-United States Exchange Foundation), Honourable Mr Shen Xin (Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. I'm very delighted to be here, tonight, for this welcome dinner of the sixth US-China Hong Kong Forum.

I would like to begin by thanking the China-United States Exchange Foundation for, once again, bringing us together. Working with the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the Foundation stages this important forum to bring us together. Bring the two largest economies in the world together.

You believe, as I do- as the vast majority of the world does - that a constructive relationship between China, our country, and the United States is essential for global well-being. And for the global economy, in pursuing mutually rewarding opportunities.

As we all know, mutually rewarding opportunity is having a difficult, even daunting, year, for China-US relations.

President Xi Jinping, in his October meeting with the US President Trump, pointed out that China and the US, and I quote, ""should be partners and friends. This is what history has taught us and reality needs.""

Unfortunately, ""reality"" has often been sidelined in China-US relations today. That means that Hong Kong-US ties - a special component within the China-US relationship - are also affected, despite a US diplomatic presence here, going back more than 180 years.

The US has ensnared Hong Kong in its world-wide tariffs' web. Its self-made-up story of reciprocal tariffs for the so-called unfair, unbalanced trade in the case of Hong Kong is absolutely flawed. The US has been enjoying one of the largest bilateral merchandise trade surpluses with Hong Kong. Last year alone, the trade surplus surpassed US$ 21 billion, the second-largest among its trade partners. Over the past decade, the US has run up a trade surplus with Hong Kong worth more than US$ 271 billion, the largest among its trading partners.

America's trade with Hong Kong supports more than 140 000 American jobs, from agriculture to fashion, manufacturing and much more.

Not surprisingly, nearly 1 400 US companies were operating in Hong Kong as of last year. That makes the US Hong Kong's second-largest source of foreign-affiliated companies. That, let me add, was up 117 companies, year-on-year.

According to the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong's 2025 Business Sentiment Survey, 75 per cent, three quarters, of its surveyed members reported either stable or increased revenue last year, compared to 2023.

More than 80 000 US citizens live and work in Hong Kong, confident and comfortable in a city they share so many common values with.

They can see, for themselves, the ""one country, two systems"" principle in action, in dynamic action, how Hong Kong connects East and West, and in so many ways, for so many economies and businesses and peoples.

Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is the only world city that converges both the China advantage and the global advantage. We boast a long and established tradition of the rule of law, a common law system shared by most global financial hubs, and a judiciary that exercises its judicial power independently, free from any interference.

Equally important, our people, and business owners, share Hong Kong's commitment to open and free trade. We are, after all, a founding member of the World Trade Organization.

The so-called ""reciprocal tariff"" for Hong Kong is therefore out of sense given that the trade balance between us is tilted heavily in favour of the US. And the fact that Hong Kong does not impose customs tariffs on goods from the US - or any other country.

Hong Kong will continue, I assure you, to do what we've always done. We champion free trade and create opportunities for local businesses and investors, and the economies, companies and investors they do business with.

With the firm support of our country, Hong Kong is fast developing its eight centres of excellence, and maintain a pivotal role in such national strategies as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. We are flush with opportunities - mutual opportunities. And in that, we continue to roll out a welcome mat for the US businesses and investors.

They can take confidence in our free trade policies, our simple and low tax regime - free from sales tax, capital gains tax, estate duty and tax on dividends - and our free flow of information, capital, goods and talent.

Speaking of talent, the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development, in its 2025 World Talent Ranking, rated Hong Kong fourth in the world, and tops in Asia.

Our talent initiatives of the past three years are working. And well. Since we rolled out an enhanced talent attraction regime at the end of 2022, we have received applications from over 550 000 professionals and young talent around the world. Over 376 000 applications have been approved, and around 250 000 of them have already arrived in Hong Kong. They are graduates from top universities, high earners in their industries, technology talent, and more. They bring with them expertise, experience and, more importantly, impetus to our economy.

More than talent, Hong Kong has also proved highly attractive to a world of business. Last month, OASES, the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises I set up three years ago, welcomed nearly 20 new key companies to Hong Kong, including three of the world's top pharmaceutical corporations. That takes the number of strategic companies in Hong Kong, thanks to OASES, to 102, 16 of which are, yes, American companies - more than any other overseas country.

We're pleased to have them here, creating employment, initiating R&D (research and development) projects and investing in Hong Kong's future - and theirs.

No doubt, they will also love Hong Kong's rising place as the world's East meets West centre for international cultural exchange.

In the end, ladies and gentlemen, dialogue is always better than confrontation. Collaboration is more effective than unilateralism.

But, of course, no one knows that better than the China-United States Exchange Foundation, and all of you here this evening.

Your theme for this year's two-day Forum, ""Circles for Peace"", surrounds AI (artificial intelligence), geopolitics and people-to-people ties. And I understand that some 50 prominent speakers, from all over the world, will engage those issues and their global import before an audience of some 500 strong.

Beyond this Forum, you also engage a broader, and even more diverse, audience. Thanks to the Foundation's efforts, more than 3 000 students have taken part in exchange programmes between our country and the US over the years.

And this year, the Foundation hosted the first US-China Art Dialogue in Hong Kong during Art March and the annual Art Basel art fair. Nearly 100 artists and arts aficionados from the US and China discussed how arts and artists can encourage people-to-people ties between the US and China.

In hosting inspirational events, and in many other ways, we will make it abundantly clear that global peace, and prosperity, can only be achieved through dialogue, mutual respect and leadership.

In that, China and the United States must play the leading roles.

The world also needs moderators and mediators. And I believe that Hong Kong and the China-United States Exchange Foundation have more than some experience to offer.

My thanks to the Foundation, and to the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, for once again organising this very important US-China Hong Kong Forum.

I wish you all a rewarding Forum, and a very enjoyable evening. Thank you."
