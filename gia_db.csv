立法會九題：預防僱員在工作時中暑,2025-06-25 12:17,2025-06-25 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/25/P2025062500348.htm,"以下是今日（六月二十五日）在立法會會議上郭偉强議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

本港近年夏季天氣越發炎熱，長時間在酷熱環境下工作的工友隨時面臨中暑的危險。政府就二○二五至二六財政年度開支預算回覆本會時表示，二○二二年至二○二四年，在勞工處登記與熱壓力有關的工傷個案數字有上升的趨勢。有意見認為，現時《預防工作時中暑指引》（《指引》）仍屬建議性質，並無強制要求僱主嚴格執行，若缺乏企業跟從《指引》，未必能有效減少與中暑相關的意外發生。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年勞工處的《職業安全及健康統計數字》內，「所有工作地點之職業傷亡個案—按意外類別分析」的個案中，有多少宗屬「其他類別」的個案與中暑有關，其中因中暑而造成死亡的個案宗數為何，並按行業列出分項數字；會否將中暑單獨列為意外類別之一；

（二）鑑於現時經優化後的工作暑熱警告（警告）與香港天文台（天文台）的「極端酷熱」特別提示相連結，但有業內人士反映，天文台與熱壓力有關的數據與工作場所的實際溫度存在偏差（即不同地區的氣溫未必完全一致），加上地盤高空的實際溫度與從地面監測所得的數據亦存在偏差，政府會否降低黃色、紅色及黑色三級警告對應的香港暑熱指數標準，同時優化「安全智慧工地」系統，善用科技實時監測區域溫度，以提供精準預警，降低員工中暑的風險；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為，現時《指引》欠缺法律約束力，而警告機制除了欠缺穩定性外，亦無法涵蓋所有工作環境，政府會否進一步細化《指引》，或考慮循立法方向強制執行工作地點熱壓力風險評估，以保障工友在安全環境下工作；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就郭議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）勞工處一直將中暑或與熱壓力相關的工傷個案獨立統計及記錄。過去三年有關個案按行業劃分的數字如下：

* 二○二四年的部分個案仍在調查當中，因此個案數字可能會因應調查結果而有所變更
^ 有關個案為死亡個案

（二）為避免僱員在炎熱天氣下工作時中暑，僱主應參考勞工處發出的《預防工作時中暑指引》（《指引》），為僱員工作時的熱壓力進行風險評估，並根據評估結果採取相應的防暑措施。當工作暑熱警告發出時，表示處於炎熱天氣下工作的僱員普遍面對高水平的熱壓力風險，僱主應按《指引》的原則和建議，評估是否需要採取進一步的控制措施，包括每小時安排休息時間，以減低中暑風險。

工作暑熱警告是根據香港天文台的香港暑熱指數（指數）制定的全港性警報系統。天文台以京士柏氣象站測量所得，綜合氣溫、濕度、空氣流動及太陽熱輻射等影響熱壓力因素的氣象數據計算出指數，而指數的計算程式是根據過往的測量數據與同期本港整體入院數字進行關聯分析後得出的。因此，指數水平能適當反映天氣對香港整體市民構成的熱壓力和健康風險。工作暑熱警告按不同的指數水平分為黃、紅、黑三級，顯示遞增的熱壓力風險。僱主及僱員在警告生效時根據《指引》建議實施相應的工作及休息安排，一般都能有效減低僱員工作時中暑的風險。

然而，若僱主和僱員因其工作地點的特殊情況（例如地理位置和工作環境），認為「工作暑熱警告」未能實時及充分反映在該工作地點的僱員所面對的熱壓力風險，僱主可自行另作評估，例如尋求職業健康專業人員在工作地點量度濕球黑球溫度指數評估僱員面對的熱壓力，並按結果採取相應的預防措施，減低僱員工作時中暑的風險。此外，視乎個別地點具備的資源和專業支援，僱主在可行情況下可將相關數據與已設置的「安全智慧工地」系統相連繫進行監測和風險管理。

（三）根據《職業安全及健康條例》第六條的一般責任條款，僱主須在合理地切實可行範圍內，確保其僱員在工作中的安全及健康，包括為他們提供或維持屬安全和不會危害健康的工作環境及工作系統。因此，僱主須為處於酷熱環境工作的僱員進行熱壓力風險評估，並根據評估結果，採取所需的風險控制措施避免僱員在工作時中暑。

為協助僱主履行上述一般責任條款，勞工處推出《預防工作時中暑指引》及制定工作暑熱警告，讓僱主及僱員可參考《指引》提供的建議，因應熱壓力水平制定適當、以風險為本的防暑措施，減低僱員工作時中暑的風險。為提升工作暑熱警告系統的穩定性，勞工處去年調整了警告系統的取消機制，有效減少警告取消後在短時間內重發的情況，避免僱主重複調整防暑措施的需要。

我們相信《指引》及工作暑熱警告有助提升僱主及僱員在預防工作時中暑方面的意識和能力，並會繼續透過多元的宣傳和推廣、教育及培訓，提醒和協助他們參照《指引》採取適當的防暑措施。

此外，勞工處會持續進行巡查及執法工作，特別在夏季會加强視察中暑風險較高的工作地點，確保僱主採取適當措施預防僱員在工作時中暑。若巡查發現有不足之處，視乎情況的嚴重性和所得證據，會按相關法例作出相應的執法行動。"
LCQ9: Preventing employees from suffering heat stroke at work,2025-06-25 12:17,2025-06-25 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/25/P2025062500352.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Kwok Wai-keung and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (June 25):

Question:

 Hong Kong has become increasingly hot during summer in recent years, and workers who have to work in a hot environment for long hours are at risk of heat stroke at any time. In the reply to this Council on the Estimates of Expenditure 2025-2026, the Government has indicated that the number of heat stress-related work injury cases registered by the Labour Department (LD) from 2022 to 2024 has shown a rising trend. There are views that the existing Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work (GN) is still advisory in nature and there is no mandatory requirement for strict enforcement by employers, so the occurrence of heat stroke-related accidents may not be effectively minimised if there is a lack of compliance of enterprises with GN. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) among the cases of ""Occupational Injuries in All Workplace - analysed by Type of Accident"" in LD's Occupational Safety and Health Statistics in each of the past three years, of the number of heat stroke-related cases under ""Others"" and, among them, the number of cases which deaths were caused by heat stroke, together with a breakdown by industry; whether heat stroke will be separated as a standalone type of accident;

(2) while the optimised Heat Stress at Work Warning (warning) is now linked with the ""Extremely Hot"" special alert of the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO), some members of the trade have relayed that HKO's data relating to heat stress has deviated from the actual temperature at workplaces (i.e. the temperature may not be the same in different districts), coupled with the deviation between the actual temperature of construction site at height and the ground level monitoring data, whether the Government will lower the benchmark of the Hong Kong Heat Index which corresponds to the three warning levels of amber, red and black, and at the same time enhance the Smart Site Safety System by leveraging technologies for real-time monitoring of the temperatures in various districts, so as to give accurate advance warnings and reduce the risk of employees suffering from heat stroke; and

(3) as there are views that the existing GN is not legally binding and the warning mechanism not only lacks stability, but also fails to cover all working environments, whether the Government will further refine GN or consider mandating the implementation of the workplace heat stress risk assessment through legislative approach, so as to ensure that workers can work in a safe environment; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 My reply to the Hon Kwok's question is as follows:

(1) The Labour Department (LD) has been keeping separate statistics and records on cases of heat stroke or work injury cases related to heat stress. The breakdown of such cases by industry in the past three years is as follows:

* As some cases in 2024 are still under investigation, the case numbers may be subject to change based on the investigation outcome
^ The case is a fatal case

(2) To prevent employees from suffering heat stroke while working in hot weather, employers should, with reference to LD's Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work (GN), conduct risk assessments on heat stress for employees at work, and implement corresponding preventive measures based on the assessment results. When the Heat Stress at Work Warning (HSWW) is issued, it indicates that employees working in hot weather generally face a high level of heat stress risk. Employers should, taking account of the principles and recommendations of the GN, assess whether further control measures are needed, including the arrangement of hourly rest periods to reduce the risk of heat stroke.

 The HSWW is a territory-wide alert system established on the basis of Hong Kong Heat Index (HKHI) of the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). The HKHI announced by the HKO is calculated from meteorological data measured at the King's Park Meteorological Station, which integrates factors affecting heat stress such as temperature, humidity, air movement, and solar thermal radiation. The calculation formula of the HKHI was derived from correlation analyses of past measurement data and the overall hospital admission figures in Hong Kong in the same period. Hence, the level of the HKHI can appropriately reflect the heat stress and health risks posed by weather to the general public in Hong Kong. The HSWW consists of three levels based on different values of the HKHI, namely Amber, Red, and Black, which indicate increasing heat stress risks. When the HSWW is in force, employers and employees implementing corresponding work and rest arrangements with reference to the recommendations in the GN can, in general, effectively reduce the risk of heat stroke posed to employees at work.

 However, if employers and employees, having regard to the specific circumstances of their workplaces (such as geographical location and work environment), believe that the HSWW cannot timely or adequately reflect the heat stress risk faced by employees at the concerned workplaces, employers can conduct their own assessments, such as seeking help from occupational health professionals to measure the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature Index at the work site to assess the heat stress faced by employees and take corresponding preventive measures based on the results to reduce their risk of sustaining heat stroke at work. In addition, depending on the resources and professional support available at individual sites, employers can, where feasible, connect relevant data to the established Smart Site Safety System for monitoring and risk management.

(3) In accordance with the general duty clauses of section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, every employer must, so far as reasonably practicable, ensure the safety and health at work of all the employer's employees, including the provision or maintenance of a working environment and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health of the employees. Therefore, employers are required to conduct heat stress risk assessments for employees working in hot environment, and take necessary risk control measures based on the assessment results to safeguard employees against heat stroke at work.

 To assist employers in fulfilling the above general duty provisions, the LD issued the GN and introduced the HSWW, enabling employers and employees to refer to the recommendations in the GN and develop appropriate, risk-based preventive measures according to the heat stress level, thereby reducing the risk of heat stroke at work. To enhance the stability of the HSWW system, the LD adjusted the cancellation mechanism of the warning system last year, effectively reducing the occurrence of re-issuing warning within a short time after cancellation, and avoiding the need for employers to adjust preventive measures repeatedly.

 We believe that the GN and the HSWW can raise the awareness and capacity of employers and employees in preventing heat stroke at work, and we will continue our efforts in organising various publicity and promotional activities as well as providing education and training to remind and assist them to take appropriate heat stroke preventive measures in accordance with the GN.

 Moreover, the LD will continue to conduct inspection and law enforcement work. In particular, inspection of workplaces with a higher risk of heat stroke will be stepped up during summer time to ensure that employers have taken appropriate measures to safeguard employees against heat stroke at work. If irregularities are found during inspection, suitable law enforcement actions will be taken based on the seriousness of the circumstances and the evidence available."

LCQ18: Licence for billiard establishment,2025-06-25 12:10,2025-06-25 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/25/P2025062500340.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Yung Hoi-yan and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (June 25):

Question:

Under the Places of Amusement Regulation (Chapter 132BA), Places of Amusement Licence must be obtained for the operation of billiard establishment with four tables or more. However, it is learnt that some billiard establishments without the required licence are operating inside industrial buildings, evading the licensing requirement by adopting such operating practices as providing three or fewer tables in subdivided or sub-‍let units. There are views that such practices may contravene the deeds of mutual covenant of the buildings and create an unfair advantage over other billiard establishments that are licensed. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled the following information on billiard establishments that currently provide three or fewer tables but have not obtained the licence: (i) the number of billiard establishments, (ii) ‍the number of units involved, (iii) the duration of operation, and (iv) whether the deeds of mutual covenant of the buildings occupied by such establishments have been contravened, together with a breakdown by the 18 districts across the territory; if not, whether it has plans to start compiling and maintaining such information from now on;

(2) of the following information on complaints received by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) regarding illegal operation of billiard establishments each year over the past five years: (i) the number of complaints received, (ii) the number of complaints found to be substantiated, (iii) the number of prosecutions initiated, (iv) the number of successful prosecutions, (v) the number of persons prosecuted, (vi) the offences involved, and (vii) the number of billiard establishments involved;

(3) whether it has plans to step up efforts in combatting billiard establishments operating illegally, and those adopting the aforesaid practices to evade the licensing requirement, such as stepping up law enforcement actions, amending relevant laws, and imposing harsher penalties; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) as some members of the industry have relayed that currently applications for the licence for billiard establishments need to be vetted and approved by different government departments such as the LCSD, the Fire Services Department, and the Buildings Department, and it has taken over nine months for some cases to be processed (meaning that the applicants have to pay nine months' rent for premises not yet placed in service but intended for operating the billiard establishment, amounting to several million dollars), whether the Government has plans to expedite the vetting and approval process for the licence; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

My reply to the Hon Yung Hoi-yan's questions are set out below:

(1) The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) is responsible for the licensing of billiard establishments with four or more billiard tables pursuant to the Places of Amusement Regulation (Cap. 132BA) under the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (the Ordinance). It maintains a register of licensed billiard establishments to ensure that the licensees comply with, among others, the requirements in respect of fire safety, building safety and health. It does not keep any information on venues with three or fewer billiard tables.

(2) Over the past five years (from January 2021 to June 2025), the number of complaints and prosecutions related to suspected unlicensed operation of billiard establishments handled by the LCSD is tabulated below:

*as of June 12

(3) The LCSD has set up a dedicated webpage for Places of Amusement Licences. The webpage lists out the licensed billiard establishments for the reference of the general public and facilitates their selection. It also assists in reporting unlicensed operations of billiard establishments.

The LCSD will take immediate follow-up actions upon receiving complaints about suspected unlicensed billiard establishments (including evasion of the need to obtain licences by any means) or case referrals from other departments. The LCSD may, depending on actual circumstances, launch joint operations with other law enforcement departments. If unlicensed operation is confirmed after investigation, the LCSD will prosecute the operator in accordance with the law. Any person operating a regulated billiard establishment without a licence issued under the Ordinance, upon conviction, may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to six months and a maximum fine of $25,000. In addition, if other irregularities (such as violation of lease conditions) are found at the premises, the LCSD will refer such cases to relevant departments for follow-up. The LCSD will continue to monitor the operation of billiard establishments and review the enforcement action and penalties under the existing legislation from time to time. The LCSD will step up efforts to combat the operation of unlicensed billiard establishments as and when necessary.

(4) The dedicated page on Places of Amusement Licences on the LCSD's website sets out the general licensing requirements, application guidelines and frequently asked questions to assist applicants interested in operating billiard establishments in preparing the necessary documents and layout plans for their licence applications.

The time required to vet each application depends on whether the individual applicant meets the licensing conditions, as well as the time needed by relevant departments (including the Fire Services Department and the Buildings Department) to examine the information submitted by the applicant and approve the relevant works for the premises concerned. If the applicant responds to and follows up on the advice of relevant departments in a timely manner, the approval process can generally be completed in about four to seven months upon receipt of the application and all required information.

The LCSD is committed to simplifying the application procedures for Places of Amusement Licences all along, and will continue to review and refine relevant procedures, including simplifying the application forms and providing online submission channel.

To allow sufficient time for the professions to complete the enrolment process, a two-month grace period until September 1 will be provided. The PHC Commission encourages OTs and PTs to register as early as possible, so that they can continue to provide relevant government-subsidised services to members of the public.

The Primary Healthcare Blueprint recommended expanding the PCD to cover more healthcare professionals and developing sub-directories for allied health professionals, including OTs and PTs, with a view to ensuring their participation in continuing medical education or continuing professional development programmes relevant to their disciplines, thereby enhancing the quality of primary healthcare services. In addition, the Blueprint recommended requiring all primary healthcare service providers to use eHealth to promote continuity of healthcare services and cross-sector collaboration.

To minimise the impact on citizens enjoying the subsidised services concerned, the PHC Commission has maintained close communication with the OT and PT professions through different channels since March to introduce them to the details of the new requirements and assist them in enlisting in the PCD and/or joining eHealth. Those OTs and PTs currently participating in relevant government-subsidised programmes but who are yet to be enlisted in the PCD and join eHealth by the end of the grace period (i.e. from September 2 onwards) will no longer be able to offer those government-subsidised primary healthcare services to their patients.

Members of the public may enquire with their OTs or PTs or visit the PCD website (apps.pcdirectory.gov.hk/Public/EN) to confirm whether they are enlisted in the PCD, to ensure that they can continue receiving the relevant subsidised services from the same OT or PT after the grace period.

The PCD is a web-based database containing practice information and professional qualifications of primary healthcare service providers in the community. It enables members of the public to look for service providers' information, such as their practice addresses, telephone numbers, consultation hours, and service provisions, as well as their participation in various government-subsidised programmes, and to choose a suitable primary healthcare service provider according to their personal needs. Subsequent to the establishment of sub-directories for OTs and PTs, the Government will continue to develop sub-directories for other healthcare professionals in phases, with a view to promoting multidisciplinary collaboration in providing comprehensive primary healthcare services to members of the public."

LCQ22: Technology Voucher Programme,2025-06-25 11:30,2025-06-25 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/25/P2025062500299.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Paul Tse and a written reply by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, in the Legislative Council today (June 25):

Question:

 The Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC) launched the Technology Voucher Programme (TVP) in 2016 to subsidise enterprises in using technological services on a matching basis to enhance their productivity. It has been reported that since the launch of TVP, a total of nearly 35 000 projects involving a total of over $6.2 billion of public funding have been approved. However, suspected abuse cases have been found in a number of projects, including: (i) individuals with the same name registering with different companies and repeatedly applying for subsidies for the research and development of the same projects, (ii) nearly 2 000 projects and over 1 000 projects being approved with the same funding amount (accurate to one decimal place and some economists have described the figures as rather ""statistically odd""), (iii) some applicant companies are suspected of having no actual operational activity or having already closed down, and (iv) there are doubts about the time taken to complete the development of the approved projects (e.g. $180,000 was granted to a company that updated its website and developed its mobile phone application in a speedy manner within two days; there was also a case in which a company developed an ""Intelligent Anatomical Model Measurement System"" in 27 days and was granted $480,000), etc. This has aroused suspicion that there are loopholes in the monitoring of TVP. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the authorities have conducted random checks for subsidised projects granted under TVP in the past three years; if so, of the number and content of the random checks conducted and, among them, the respective numbers of applications suspected and confirmed to be abusive; if not, whether it will expeditiously activate the investigations in the light of the aforesaid media reports;

(2) in respect of each application involving abuse of public subsidies or even fraud under TVP, of the follow-up actions actually taken by the authorities and the respective amounts of subsidies successfully and unsuccessfully recovered in such cases;

(3) as the aforesaid reports have pointed out that some companies funded under TVP closed down shortly after receiving grants, of the measures put in place by the authorities to eradicate this situation; whether enterprises receiving approved grants will be required to regularly submit data on the use of technology projects/systems for monitoring purposes; and

(4) whether the authorities will conduct a comprehensive review of TVP's effectiveness since its implementation; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; whether they have assessed the actual increase in productivity, competitiveness and entrepreneurial return achieved by enterprises that applied for subsidies after upgrading their technological level?

Reply:

President,

 In response to the Hon Paul Tse's question, our consolidated reply is as follows:

 The Government ceased accepting new applications for the Technology Voucher Programme (TVP) after December 31, 2024. To ensure proper use of public funds, the Hong Kong Productivity Council as the TVP Secretariat (the Secretariat) has been rigorously reviewing the applications, final project reports and supplementary information submitted by the applicants, and conducting random on-site checks on individual projects in order to ensure that the applications are eligible for funding and that the project deliverables conform to relevant requirements. When submitting TVP applications, every applicant must provide documentary evidence proving its substantive business operations in Hong Kong. Relevant documents include information on business operations, financial operations and employment. If any suspicious cases are identified, Innovation and Technology Commission will immediately withhold processing the relevant cases, cease disbursing any payments, and refer them to law enforcement agencies for follow-up.

 After rigorous review by the Secretariat, each eligible TVP application will be assessed based on individual merits and considered on a case-by-case basis. According to the TVP Guidance Notes, the TVP Committee/the Secretariat will assess whether the project budget is reasonable by making reference to market prices of the technologies as known to them. If a project is worthy of support in principle but the project budget is higher than the estimated price, the Secretariat will, on a modular basis, adjust the level of funding with reference to the project cost approved by the TVP Committee. Therefore, projects/technological solutions of similar nature and scale (e.g. Enterprise Resource Planning System) will have the same approved amounts after the aforementioned adjustments. In addition, since the amount of funding is calculated on the basis of the funding ratio, there may be odd cents after the calculation.

 TVP has established rigorous checking mechanism to verify whether the approved projects are implemented. Applicants are required to implement the project in accordance with the approved application and funding agreement, and submit a final project report to the Secretariat upon completion of the project, together with evidence of deliverables (such as hardware photos and system screen captures), copy of invoice(s) and corresponding receipt(s) in relation to the payment for each expenditure item, an audited statement of income and expenditure for the project from an independent auditor (if the approved funding exceeds HK$50,000)/a final income and expenditure statement prepared by the applicant (if the approved funding is HK$50,000 or below). The Secretariat will also conduct random on-site checks on individual projects, requiring applicants to demonstrate the developed technological solutions on the spot so as to verify whether they comply with the requirements of the approved application and the TVP. Taking the cases with ""progress issues"" mentioned by media report and quoted in the question as an example, the final reports failed to pass the Secretariat's assessment and no funding was disbursed.

 According to the TVP funding agreement, applicants are required to keep the relevant hardware and software for at least one year after project completion, and keep a proper and separate set of books and records for the project for seven years after project completion for checking. The Secretariat will conduct random checks on applicants to see if they comply with the relevant requirements. 

 In the past three years, the Secretariat has conducted random on-site checks on 1860 projects and referred 15 suspicious cases to law enforcement agencies for follow-up. The Secretariat will recover the funding from applicants convicted in the cases. As the investigations/judicial proceedings by the law enforcement agencies are still ongoing, we have no record of funding recovery for the time being.

 To assess the effectiveness of the TVP on the funded enterprises/organisations, we require enterprises/organisations to submit evaluation reports six months after project completion on whether the project could achieve the objectives of improving productivity, or upgrading or transforming their business processes. As at end-2024, 8587 of the funded enterprises/organisations with completed projects had submitted evaluation reports to the Secretariat. Ninety-nine per cent of them were of the view that the projects were conducive to enhancing their competitiveness. Specific benefits include saving manpower, time and/or cost, increasing revenue, and upgrading/transforming/streamlining business processes.

 The Government conducted a fundamental review on the TVP in 2024 and considered that the programme has achieved its original intent. In recent years, the Government has continued to strengthen support measures for different industries, and many bureaux and departments have introduced more targeted funding schemes dedicated to the specific conditions or operational needs of individual industries. It was therefore decided that TVP would cease accepting new applications after December 31, 2024.

The Secretariat will continue to review and enhance the vetting procedures of TVP so as to process the outstanding cases. In view of the large number of applications received before the deadline on December 31, 2024, the Secretariat has adopted a stringent vetting approach, requiring applicants to provide documents to prove that they have substantive business operations, the procurement procedures meet the requirements, and the budget and other details of the proposed technological solutions are reasonable and realistic. The Secretariat will continue to rigorously review the documents submitted by applicants for each application to ensure proper use of public funds."
Third application announced under New Industrialisation Acceleration Scheme supported by Vetting Committee and enhancement measure launched for New Industrialisation Funding Scheme,2025-06-25 11:30,2025-06-25 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/25/P2025062500315.htm,"The Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC) announced today (June 25) that the New Industrialisation Vetting Committee under the Innovation and Technology Fund has supported an application submitted by J Cube Semiconductor (Hong Kong) Limited under the New Industrialisation Acceleration Scheme (NIAS). The project plans to set up third-generation semiconductor silicon carbide wafer production facilities, which fall under the advanced manufacturing technology sector. This is the third NIAS project supported by the Vetting Committee. The estimated total cost of the project is over $700 million, and the expected NIAS funding amount will be $200 million.

At the same time, to further support enterprises in adopting smart manufacturing and to seize market opportunities, the ITC has introduced an enhancement to the New Industrialisation Funding Scheme (NIFS). For NIFS applications seeking funding support of no more than $2.8 million, they will be processed according to the newly established streamlined procedures to speed up the process of approving NIFS applications.

The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, said, ""The Government actively promotes the development of new industrialisation through the NIAS and the NIFS, injecting new impetus into Hong Kong's economy. We are pleased that enterprises are making use of the funding support from these two schemes to set up new smart production facilities in Hong Kong. Funded enterprises will bring to Hong Kong the relevant technologies and expertise of product manufacturing, driving the development of Hong Kong's new industrialisation and diversified economy.""

The Government launched the NIAS in September 2024. The NIAS provides funding support on a 1 (Government): 2(enterprise) matching basis for enterprises engaging in industries of strategic importance (i.e. life and health technology, AI and data science, advanced manufacturing and new energy technologies) and contributing no less than $200 million to setting up new smart production facilities in Hong Kong. For each project, the minimum total project cost is $300 million. Each enterprise can receive up to $200 million of funding under the NIAS. In addition, the Government encourages enterprises with approved projects under the NIAS to carry out research or increase their scale of research in Hong Kong by providing additional funding for them to engage research talent, as well as facilitating such enterprises in employing non-local talent required for setting up or operating the new production facilities in Hong Kong.

The NIFS aims to subsidise manufacturers on a 1 (Government): 2 (enterprise) matching basis to set up new smart production lines in Hong Kong. The funding ceiling for each project is one-third of the total project cost or $15 million, whichever is lower. Each enterprise can carry out up to three projects concurrently to receive a maximum total funding of up to $45 million under the NIFS.

The NIAS and the NIFS are open for applications throughout the year. Details are available on the website of the Innovation and Technology Fund (www.itf.gov.hk). For enquiries, please contact the Secretariat of the schemes (Tel: 3655 5678; email: enquiry@itf.gov.hk)."

答覆：

主席：

就謝偉俊議員的提問，現綜合回覆如下：

政府已於二○二四年十二月三十一日停止接受「科技券」申請。為保障公帑運用得宜，由香港生產力促進局擔任的科技券計劃秘書處（秘書處）一直嚴謹審查申請者提交的申請書、項目最終報告及補充資料，並且對個別項目進行實地抽查，以確保申請符合資格及項目成果符合相關規定。每個申請者在提交「科技券」申請時都必須提供證明文件，充分證明其在香港有實質業務運作，有關文件包括業務運作、財務運作及僱用員工等各方面的資料。就所有可疑個案，創新科技署會即時暫緩處理有關個案及停止發放任何撥款，並會轉交執法部門跟進。

經秘書處嚴謹審查後，每宗合資格的「科技券」申請均會按個別情況予以評審和考慮。根據「科技券」申請指南，「科技券計劃委員會」（委員會）／秘書處在評審過程中會參照所知悉的有關技術的市場價格，評估項目預算是否合理。如申請原則上值得支持而項目預算高於評估價格，秘書處會參考委員會核准的項目成本，以模組化方式（modules）調整資助金額。因此，性質與規模相近的項目／科技方案（例如「企業資源規劃系統」），在經上述調整後，其獲批金額會出現相同情況。此外，由於獲資助金額按資助比例計算，計算後可能會出現「零頭」數字。

就獲批項目是否如實推行，「科技券」計劃設有嚴格的核查機制。申請者須根據獲批的申請及資助協議推展項目，並在項目完成後向秘書處提交項目最終報告，以及項目成果證明（如實物的相片、系統截圖）、每個開支項目的付款發票及相應收據、由獨立審計師編製的經審計項目收支表（如核准資助額超過五萬港元）／申請者擬備的最後收支表（如核准資助額為五萬港元或以下），以供秘書處查核。秘書處亦會隨機對個別項目進行實地抽查，要求申請者即場示範使用已建立的科技方案以核實是否符合核准申請書及「科技券」計劃的規定。就問題中引述報導提及有「進度問題」的個案為例，最終報告未能通過秘書處的審查，均不獲發資助款項。

根據「科技券」計劃資助協議，申請者須在項目期結束後保留相關硬體及軟體至少一年，以及在項目完成後七年內為項目備存一套妥善及獨立的帳簿和記錄以供核查。秘書處會抽查申請者是否遵守有關規定。

過去三年，秘書處共對1 860個項目進行了實地抽查，以及將共15宗懷疑個案轉交給執法部門跟進。秘書處會向案件中被定罪的申請者追討資助款項，由於執法部門的調查工作／司法程序仍在進行中，我們暫時沒有追討相關款項的記錄。

為評估「科技券」對獲資助企業／機構的成效，我們要求企業／機構在項目完成六個月後提交評估報告，評估項目是否能達至提高生產力或將業務流程升級轉型。截至二○二四年底，已完成項目的獲資助企業／機構中有8587個已向秘書處提交評估報告，當中99%認為項目有助增強其競爭力，具體成效包括節省人手、時間及／或成本，增加營業額，以及升級／轉型／簡化業務流程等。

政府在二○二四年對「科技券」進行全面檢討，認為計劃已達至其最初設立的目的，加上近年來政府持續加強對不同行業的支援，多個政策局及部門因應各行業的具體情況或業務需要分別推出了更具針對性的資助計劃，因此決定在二○二四年十二月三十一日後停止接受「科技券」的新申請。

秘書處會繼續檢視及優化「科技券」的核查程序以處理尚未完成的個案。因應二○二四年十二月三十一日截止日期前收到大量申請，秘書處已採取嚴謹的核查程序，要求申請者提供一系列文件證明具有實質性業務，採購程序符合要求，以及建議科技方案的預算和其他細節為合理及切實可行等。秘書處會繼續就每宗申請嚴謹審查申請者提交的文件，以保障公帑運用得宜。"
立法會十二題：非牟利機構的稅務優惠及補貼政策,2025-06-25 11:25,2025-06-25 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/25/P2025062400470.htm,"以下是今日（六月二十五日）在立法會會議上狄志遠議員的提問和署理財經事務及庫務局局長陳浩濂的書面答覆：

問題：

本財政年度的《財政預算案》提出削減政府經常開支，由二○二四／二○二五年度至二○二七／二○二八年度的累計減幅為百分之七，而獲政府資助的非牟利機構的資源亦被削減。有意見認為，有關情況令社福資源出現嚴重緊絀，使弱勢社群經常未能得到適切服務。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（二）過去五年，政府從獲資助的非牟利機構徵收的稅收總額為何，以及當中包括哪些稅項；

（三）有否檢視，現行《稅務條例》（第112章）對非牟利機構的稅務安排是否合適；政府會否考慮檢討相關條例，以為非牟利機構提供更明確或進一步的稅務豁免；

（四）除根據第112章所提供的稅務寬減措施外，政府現時有否其他行政安排減輕非牟利機構的稅務負擔（例如為其繳交部分稅項及提供相關補貼）；若有，涵蓋的範圍為何；若否，會否考慮提供相關行政措施；及

（五）政府會否參考其他地區對非牟利機構的稅務優惠或補貼政策，並引入相關措施，以減輕香港非牟利機構的稅務負擔並提升其運作效率？

答覆：

主席︰

政府秉持審慎理財的原則，在二○二五至二六年度《財政預算案》提出強化財政整合計劃，以節流、善用政府財政資源，以及開源作為重點。政府的原則是以嚴格控制政府開支為主，開源為輔，並盡量減低對一般市民的影響。因此，政府在加大政策局和部門在「資源效率優化計劃」的節流力度時，是以維持公共服務效率，以及不影響綜合社會保障援助、公共福利金及法定開支作為前提。所有政策局和部門均獲提供彈性，在善用公帑的前提下，可按本身工作優次整合資源，以更具成本效益的方式為市民提供服務。

就狄志遠議員的提問，經諮詢稅務局及相關政策局後，我綜合回覆如下：

根據《稅務條例》（第112章）（《條例》），任何人士（包括法團、合夥業務、受託人或團體）在香港經營業務而從該業務獲得於香港產生或得自香港的應評稅利潤（售賣資本資產所得的利潤除外），均須繳納利得稅。此外，物業業主如因出租本港物業而收取租金，亦須繳納物業稅。任何團體如在某課稅年度內有上述利潤或租金收入，均需按照《條例》繳交稅款，該機構有否獲得政府津助，並非稅務局徵稅的考慮因素。

根據《條例》第88條的規定，屬公共性質的慈善機構及信託（即慈善團體）如就經營行業或業務符合某些條件，可獲豁免繳付利得稅。然而《條例》並無給予慈善機構全面稅務豁免。舉例而言，如出租物業或經營旅館構成某慈善機構的業務之一，但相關業務並不是在實際貫徹有關機構明文規定的宗旨時經營的，或與該行業或業務有關的工作並非主要由有關機構的受益人進行，所得利潤則應繳付利得稅。另外，非牟利機構不一定是慈善團體，而《條例》中並無給予非牟利機構豁免繳稅的條文。稅務局亦沒有就獲資助的非牟利機構繳交的稅款備存分項數字。

各政策局和部門不時委聘非政府機構提供公共服務，以達至其政策目標。政策局和部門可按其政策考量和需要決定所委託機構的性質，當中可包括商業機構、非牟利機構或慈善團體；以及為這些非政府機構提供資源的方式或準則。

例如，社會福利署（社署）會向非政府機構提供津助以營辦不同類型社會服務。為支援這些機構落實「資源效率優化計劃」，政府已推出一系列支援措施，包括：分擔機構的部分財政影響、增加機構運用整筆撥款儲備的彈性、優化《津貼及服務協議》及多項減省機構行政工作的安排等。同時，社署亦豁免削減18個福利項目的開支，避免影響弱勢社群，以及減輕對服務營辦機構造成的影響。

政策局和部門會留意其相關非政府機構在提供服務時的財政情況，在有需要時給予意見或支援。"

Question:

 The Budget for the current fiscal year has proposed to cut recurrent government expenditure by a cumulative seven per cent from 2024-2025 to 2027-2028, and resources for non-profit organisations subsidised by the Government have also been reduced. There are views that the relevant situation has led to severe shortage in social welfare resources, rendering the underprivileged groups always unable to receive appropriate services. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) it is learnt that, under the current arrangements, some government-subsidised non-profit organisations are still required to pay taxes (including property tax or profits tax), whether the Government has assessed if such tax burdens may lead to further financial difficulties for such organisations; if the Government has, of the assessment results;

(2) of the total amount of taxes collected by the Government from subsidised non-profit organisations over the past five years, and the types of taxes included;

(3) whether it has examined if the current tax arrangements for non-profit organisations under the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112) are appropriate; whether the Government will consider reviewing the relevant legislation to provide non-profit organisations with clearer or further tax exemptions;

(4) apart from the tax relief measures provided under Cap. 112, whether the Government currently has other administrative arrangements in place to alleviate the tax burdens on non-profit organisations (e.g. paying part of their taxes or providing relevant subsidies); if so, of the scope of such arrangements; if not, whether it will consider introducing relevant administrative measures; and

(5) whether the Government will refer to tax concessions or subsidy policies for non-profit organisations in other regions and introduce relevant measures to minimise the tax burdens on non-profit organisations in Hong Kong and enhance their operational efficiency?

Reply:

President,

 To uphold the principles of fiscal prudence, the Government put forward a reinforced fiscal consolidation programme in the 2025-26 Budget. The key is managing expenditure growth, making good use of the Government's fiscal resources, and identifying new revenue resources. The Government's principle is to focus on strictly controlling government expenditure, supplemented by increasing revenue, and minimising the impact to the general public. Hence, in stepping up the efforts of bureaux and departments (B/Ds) in cutting their expenditure under the Productivity Enhancement Programme (PEP), the Government's premises are to maintain the efficiency of public services and that the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance, Social Security Allowance and statutory expenditure will not be affected. All B/Ds have been provided with the flexibility to, on the basis of optimising the use of public funds, rationalise their resources according to their work priorities and provide services to the public in a more cost-effective manner.

 Regarding the question raised by Dr the Hon Tik Chi-yuen, having consulted the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) and relevant bureaux, our consolidated reply is as follows:

 Under the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112) (IRO), persons, including corporations, partnerships, trustees and bodies of persons, carrying on any business in Hong Kong are chargeable to profits tax on all profits (excluding profits arising from the sale of capital assets) arising in or derived from Hong Kong from such business. Besides, property owners who received rent from leasing out their properties in Hong Kong are subject to property tax. Any organisation having such profits or rents in a year of assessment is required to pay tax in accordance with the IRO. Whether the organisation has received Government subventions is not a factor for IRD to consider when imposing taxes.

 Under section 88 of the IRO, charitable institutions and trusts of a public character (i.e. charities) are exempt from profits tax subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions in relation to the trade or business carried on by them. However, the IRO does not accord full tax exemption to charities. For example, if property letting or hostel operation forms part of the charity's business and such business is not exercised in the course of the actual carrying out of the expressed objects of the relevant charity, or the work in connection with the trade or business is not mainly carried on by persons for whose benefit the charity is established, the profits derived shall be subject to profits tax. In addition, a non-profit-making organisation is not necessarily a charity and there is no provision in the IRO which exempts a non-profit-making organisation from tax. IRD does not maintain statistical breakdown of tax collected from subvented non-profit-making organisations.

 B/Ds engage non-governmental organisations (NGOs) from time to time to provide public services to meet their policy objectives. B/Ds may decide on the nature of organisation to be engaged, which may include commercial institutions, non-profit-making organisations or charities, according to their policy considerations and needs, and decide on the mode or criteria for the provision of resources to these NGOs.

 For example, the Social Welfare Department (SWD) will provide subvention to NGOs to operate different types of social services. To support these subvented organisations in implementing the PEP, the Government has already introduced a series of support measures, which include alleviating some of the financial burden on NGOs, increasing NGO's flexibility in utilising Lump Sum Grant Reserve, refining Funding and Service Agreements, and implementing various arrangements to reduce NGOs' administrative workload, etc. At the same time, the SWD has exempted 18 welfare programmes from expenditure reductions to avoid affecting the underprivileged and to mitigate the impact on service operators.

 B/Ds will keep in view the financial situation of their relevant NGOs in the delivery of services and provide advice or support when necessary."
立法會十九題：防止狗隻便溺弄污公眾地方及街道,2025-06-25 11:20,2025-06-25 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/25/P2025062500283.htm,"以下是今日（六月二十五日）在立法會會議上陳家珮議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

現時食物環境衞生署及漁農自然護理署均有就帶狗人士清理狗隻於公眾地方及街道的便溺制訂指引。然而，有意見認為，該等指引所列出的清理方法有欠完善，例如建議帶狗人士只用紙張包裹狗隻糞便然後放進垃圾箱或狗糞收集箱，以及僅以清水沖洗地面，均未能有效清理狗隻便溺及其殘留臭味，影響市容。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年因容許狗隻（i）糞便弄污街道或公眾地方，以及（ii）便溺弄污建築物公用部分而遭罰款的個案數目和罰款總額分別為何；

（二）過去三年，每年當局就狗隻隨處便溺問題所進行的突擊行動次數（按全港18區列出）；

（三）鑑於現時法例未有就帶狗人士容許狗隻小便而弄污街道訂下罰則，政府有否計劃修例以作規管；及

（四）當局有否計劃更新清理狗隻便溺的指引（例如指示帶狗人士使用有除臭及去漬作用的清潔劑沖洗狗隻便溺的地方）；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

根據《公眾潔淨及防止妨擾規例》（第132BK章），任何人士容許其狗隻在建築物的公用部分、街道上或公眾地方內大便而弄污地方，首次定罪最高可判處罰款10,000元，其後每次定罪最高可判處罰款25,000元；而容許其狗隻在建築物的公用部分小便而弄污地方，首次定罪最高可判處罰款5,000元，其後每次定罪最高可判處罰款10,000元。此外，根據《定額罰款（公眾地方潔淨及阻礙）條例》（第570章），任何人士容許狗隻糞便弄污街道或公眾地方，可被處以3,000元的定額罰款。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）和漁農自然護理署（漁護署）已就防止狗隻便溺弄污地方向公眾提供指引，包括帶狗人士須帶備足夠紙張，以便將狗糞妥為包好，再放進狗糞收集箱，並須帶備足夠清水，以沖洗乾淨狗隻便溺後的地方，保持環境衞生。

就陳家珮議員的問題，我現回覆如下：

（一）在二○二二至二○二四年期間，食環署就狗隻糞便弄污街道或公眾地方而採取執法行動的個案數目和總罰款金額如下：

24


已處理個案的
			總罰款金額（元）

＊罰款金額大幅上升主要由於自二○二三年十月二十二日起，狗隻糞便弄污街道的定額罰款金額由1,500元提高至3,000元。

考慮到部門的執法優次和資源運用，食環署針對潔淨罪行的執法工作集中在街道和公眾地方進行，而建築物公用部分的管理和衞生問題一般由業主或管理公司跟進。在二○二二至二○二四年期間，食環署沒有就狗隻便溺弄污建築物公用部分的執法紀錄。

（二）在二○二二至二○二四年期間，食環署在全港18區因應狗隻隨處便溺問題作出的突擊行動次數如下：

​漁護署和康樂及文化事務署（康文署）亦不時在轄下場地進行執法行動，處理包括狗隻隨處便溺等各類違規行為。漁護署及康文署沒有備存單就處理狗隻便溺問題的行動分項數字。

（三）一般而言，使用足夠清水沖洗狗隻小便後的地方，已能妥當清潔該地方，避免引起環境衞生問題。考慮到狗隻以尿液標記領域和外出小便的習性，以及可用足夠清水作出清潔，政府現時未擬修改法例規管狗隻於街道或公眾地方小便的情況。

政府會繼續透過不同的渠道，包括海報、小冊子、專題網站和巡迴展覽等，向公眾推廣「做個盡責任的寵物主人」訊息，並教育帶狗人士應妥善清理其狗隻的排泄物，以保持環境衞生。

（四）現時食環署和漁護署的指引已清晰要求帶狗人士在其狗隻便溺後須用足夠紙張妥為包好狗糞，或以足夠清水清理小便。就要求帶狗人士使用清潔劑清洗，我們須考慮對公眾和環境的影響，例如清潔劑會否令行人滑倒，以及清潔劑流到雨水渠會否造成污染等。政府會繼續透過宣傳和教育，讓帶狗人士依循指引妥善處理其狗隻的排泄物。"
LCQ19: Preventing dog excreta from fouling public places and streets,2025-06-25 11:20,2025-06-25 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/25/P2025062500289.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Judy Chan and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (June 25):

Question:

At present, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department have both drawn up guidelines for people walking dogs on cleaning up dog excreta in public places and on streets. However, there are views that the cleaning methods set out in such guidelines are inadequate. For example, people walking dogs are advised to use paper to wrap up dog faeces and deposit it in rubbish bins or dog excreta collection bins, and rinse the floor with water only, which are all ineffective in cleaning up dog excreta and removing its lingering odour, thereby affecting the cityscape. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of cases and total amount of fines imposed in each of the past three years for allowing dogs to foul (i) the streets or public places with faeces, and (ii) the common parts of buildings with excreta;

(2) of the number of surprise inspections conducted by the authorities in each of the past three years to address the issue of dogs excreting indiscriminately (broken down by the 18 districts across the territory);

(3) given that the existing legislation does not impose penalties on people walking dogs who allow their dogs to urinate and foul the streets, whether the Government has plans to amend the legislation to impose regulation; and

(4) whether the authorities have plans to update the guidelines on cleaning up dog excreta (e.g. instructing people walking dogs to use cleaning agents with deodorising and stain-removing properties to rinse the areas where their dogs excrete); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Under the Public Cleansing and Prevention of Nuisances Regulation (Cap. 132BK), a person who allows his dog to cause fouling by depositing faeces in the common parts of a building or in any street or public place is liable on a first conviction to a maximum fine of $10,000 and on each subsequent conviction to a maximum fine of $25,000; and a person who allows his dog to cause fouling by depositing urine in the common parts of a building is liable on a first conviction to a maximum fine of $5,000 and on each subsequent conviction to a maximum fine of $10,000. Moreover, under the Fixed Penalty (Public Cleanliness and Obstruction) Ordinance (Cap. 570), any person allowing dogs to foul the streets or public places with faeces is liable to a fixed penalty of $3,000.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) have provided the public with guidelines on prevention of fouling of places by dog excreta, advising dog walkers to take enough paper to wrap up the faeces and place it into the dog excreta collection bin, and bring sufficient clean water to rinse the spot where the dog has urinated in order to maintain environmental hygiene.

My reply to the question raised by the Hon Judy Chan is as follows:

(1) The number of cases in which the FEHD took enforcement actions against fouling of streets or public places by dog faeces, as well as the total amount of fines imposed between 2022 and 2024 are as follows:





2022
2023
2024


Number of cases
16
19
24


Total amount of fines imposed on cases handled ($)
22,500
33,000
70,000*




*The significant increase in fines was mainly due to the increase in the amount of fixed penalty for fouling of street by dog faeces from $1,500 to $3,000 with effect from October 22, 2023.

Having considered its enforcement priorities and resource deployment, the FEHD focuses its enforcement efforts against cleanliness offences in streets and public places, while the management and hygiene problems of the common parts of buildings are generally followed up by owners or management companies. The FEHD does not maintain records of enforcement against dogs fouling the common parts of buildings with excreta between 2022 and 2024.

(2) The numbers of blitz operations conducted by the FEHD in the 18 districts across the territory in response to dog fouling between 2022 and 2024 are as follows:

The AFCD and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) also conduct enforcement operations at their respective sites from time to time, addressing various irregularities such as dogs fouling. The AFCD and the LCSD do not maintain specific figures on enforcement actions solely targeting dog fouling issues.

(3) In general, rinsing the spot where the dog has urinated with sufficient clean water is enough to clean the spot properly and avoid causing environmental hygiene problems. Considering the habits of dogs marking their territory with urine and urinating outdoors, as well as the fact that using sufficient clean water is enough for cleaning, the Government currently has no plans to amend the legislation to regulate dog urination in streets or public places.

The Government will continue to promote the message of ""be a responsible pet owner"" to the public and educate dog walkers to properly clean up after their dogs through various channels, including posters, pamphlets, thematic websites and roving exhibitions, so as to maintain environmental hygiene.

(4) The guidelines issued by the FEHD and the AFCD have clearly required dog walkers to clean up after their dogs by properly wrapping up the faeces with sufficient paper or cleaning urine with sufficient clean water. As regards the requirement for dog walkers to use cleaning agents, we have to consider the impact on the public and the environment, such as whether the cleaning agents may cause pedestrians to slip and whether the discharge of cleaning agents into stormwater drains may cause pollution. The Government will continue its promotional and educational efforts so that dog walkers will follow the guidelines and properly dispose of the droppings of their dogs."
立法會十六題：救生員人手,2025-06-25 11:05,2025-06-25 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/25/P2025062500304.htm,"以下是今日（六月二十五日）在立法會會議上陳學鋒議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉因救生員人手不足，一些康樂及文化事務署（康文署）轄下刊憲泳灘（包括獲香港旅遊發展局（旅發局）在網頁推介為水上運動人氣熱點，位於大嶼山的長沙泳灘（包括上長沙泳灘和下長沙泳灘））未能在泳季提供救生員服務。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，因救生員人手不足而令整個泳季未能提供救生服務的康文署轄下刊憲泳灘為何，並按全港18區以表列出分項數字；

（二）鑑於康文署在泳季期間（即四月至十月）每日上午九時至下午六時在其轄下刊憲泳灘提供救生服務，去年因救生員人手不足而突然關閉半天或以上的刊憲泳灘及其關閉總日數分別為何；

（三）鑑於面對救生員人手短缺問題，康文署由去年九月起試行外判公眾泳池的救生及急救服務，政府有否研究將較有潛力發展水上活動的泳灘外判予私營團體營運，包括提供水上活動設施、租賃太陽傘，以及提供救生及急救服務等；若有研究，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（四）當局會否做好協調工作，以避免獲旅發局推介的泳灘因救生員人手不足而暫時關閉（例如長沙泳灘在過去兩個泳季均未能提供救生員服務），影響旅客的體驗？

答覆：

主席：

康樂及文化事務署（康文署）一直積極透過不同措施，包括提高季節性救生員薪酬和增加聘用程序的彈性等，以多管齊下的方式增加和穩定救生員的人手供應。在泳季期間（即每年四月至十月），除公務員救生員外，康文署會聘請季節性救生員協助提供救生服務，並會靈活調配現職救生員和其他資源，以盡量維持42個刊憲泳灘的服務。

就陳學鋒議員的提問，我現回覆如下：

（一）在二○二二年至二○二四年期間，因救生員人手不足而整個泳季未能提供救生服務的刊憲泳灘載列於附件。市民仍可在未能提供救生服務的刊憲泳灘享受日光浴和使用其他設施。

（二）在二○二四年並沒有刊憲泳灘因救生員人手不足而臨時關閉游泳設施半天或以上。

（三）在二○二四年九月，康文署在六個公眾游泳池試行為期兩年的外判救生及急救服務計劃，是其中一個增加和穩定救生員人手供應的措施。計劃試行至今約九個月，外判服務承辦商一直能提供穩定的服務。康文署會繼續檢視及評估計劃的推行情況。

現時，在康文署管理的42個刊憲泳灘中，超過一半已設有由企業或團體作商業營運的設施，包括小食亭、快餐亭、餐廳和獨木舟訓練中心等。經營者現時有提供銷售或出租業務（包括出租太陽傘、沙灘椅和救生圈等），以方便泳客。至於外判泳灘救生及急救服務的可行性，康文署會考慮一籃子因素，包括上文提及的外判救生及急救服務計劃的結果及經驗、公眾使用泳灘的習慣和泳客的安全保障等。康文署會繼續與各持份者積極溝通，攜手為公眾提供更優質的康樂體驗。

（四）在決定為哪些刊憲泳灘提供全面的救生服務時，康文署考慮多個因素，包括泳客人流、泳灘鄰近的配套設施，以及區議會和社區的意見和需求等。

至於一些暫未提供全面救生服務的泳灘，市民和遊客仍可享受在泳灘進行多元化的休閒活動，例如散步、堆沙和日光浴等，並使用泳灘上的小食亭服務、燒烤爐、遊樂場和沙灘排球場等設施。

康文署會繼續監察各泳灘的情況，並與相關持份者（包括香港旅遊發展局）保持緊密聯繫和協調，為市民和旅客提供合適安排。"

LCQ16: Manpower of lifeguard,2025-06-25 11:05,2025-06-25 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/25/P2025062500307.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hok-fung and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (June 25):

Question:

It is learnt that, due to the shortage of lifeguard manpower, some gazetted beaches managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) have been unable to provide lifeguard services during the swimming season. This includes Cheung Sha Beach on Lantau Island (comprising Upper Cheung Sha Beach and Lower Cheung Sha Beach), which the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) recommends on its website as an ideal location for water sports. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) which gazetted beaches under the LCSD's management were unable to provide lifesaving services for the entire swimming season over the past three years due to a shortage of lifeguard manpower, together with a tabulated breakdown by the 18 districts in Hong Kong;

(2) given that the LCSD provides lifesaving services at its gazetted beaches daily from 9am to 6pm during the swimming season (i.e. from April to October), which of these beaches were unexpectedly closed for half a day or longer last year due to insufficient lifeguard manpower, together with the total number of closure days for each of such beaches;

(3) given that, in the face of the lifeguard manpower shortage, the LCSD has been outsourcing lifesaving and first aid services at public swimming pools on a trial basis since September 2024, whether the Government has studied the possibility of outsourcing the operation of beaches with greater potential for water sports development to private organisations, including the provision of water sports facilities, beach umbrellas for hire, as well as life-saving and first-aid services; if such studies have been conducted, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) whether the authorities will co-ordinate their efforts more effectively to prevent the temporary closure of beaches recommended by the HKTB due to a shortage of lifeguard manpower (for example, Cheung Sha Beach has been unable to provide lifeguard services for the past two swimming seasons), so as to avoid an adverse impact on visitors' experiences?

Reply:

President,

The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) has all along adopted a multi-pronged approach to increase and stabilise the manpower supply of lifeguards, including implementing various measures proactively such as increasing the salaries of seasonal lifeguards and enhancing the flexibility of recruitment process. During the swimming season (i.e. from April to October every year), in addition to civil service lifeguards, the LCSD will employ seasonal lifeguards to assist in providing lifesaving services as well as deploy serving lifeguards and other resources flexibly to maintain services at the 42gazetted beaches as far as practicable.

My reply to the Hon Chan Hok-fung's questions are set out below:

(1) During the period from 2022 to 2024, the gazetted beaches where lifesaving services were not available for the entire swimming season due to a shortage of lifeguards are listed at Annex. Members of the public, however, can still enjoy sunbathing and use other facilities at these gazetted beaches.

(2) In 2024, no gazetted beaches were temporarily closed for half day or more due to a shortage of lifeguards.

(3) In September 2024, the LCSD launched a two-year programme of outsourcing the lifesaving and first aid services at six public swimming pools on a trial basis. This is one of the measures to increase and stabilise the supply of lifeguards. The programme has run for around nine months, during which the service contractor has been providing stable services. The LCSD will continue to review and evaluate the implementation of the programme.

At present, over half of the 42 gazetted beaches managed by the LCSD are already equipped with facilities operated commercially by enterprises or organisations, including light refreshment kiosks, fast food kiosks, restaurants and canoe training centres. These operators currently provide sale or rental services (including rental of sun umbrellas, beach chairs and lifebuoys) for the convenience of swimmers. As for the feasibility of outsourcing the lifesaving and first aid services, the LCSD will take into account a basket of factors, including the outcome and experience of the outsourced lifesaving and first aid services mentioned above, the usage patterns of the public at beaches and the safety of swimmers. TheLCSD will continue to actively engage with all stakeholders to jointly provide leisure experiences of better quality for the general public.

(4) When deciding which gazetted beaches to be provided with full lifesaving services, the LCSD will consider multiple factors, including the number of swimmers, the ancillary facilities in the vicinity of beaches as well as the views and demand of the District Councils and local communities.

As for those beaches where full lifesaving services are yet to be provided temporarily, members of the public and tourists can still enjoy a variety of leisure activities there, such as strolling, sand-sculpting and sunbathing. They can also use facilities such as light refreshment kiosks, barbecue pits, playgrounds and beach volleyball courts.

The LCSD will continue to monitor the situation of the beaches, and maintain close communication and co-ordination with relevant stakeholders (including the Hong Kong Tourism Board) to make appropriate arrangements for the general public and tourists."

  A department spokesman said that the adjustment on July 1, 2025, would reflect the movement of the LPG international price in June 2025. The adjusted auto-LPG ceiling prices for dedicated LPG filling stations would range from $3.55 to $4.47 per litre, amounting to a decrease of $0.05 to $0.06 per litre.

  The spokesman said that the auto-LPG ceiling prices were adjusted according to a pricing formula specified in the contracts. The formula comprises two elements - the LPG international price and the LPG operating price. The LPG international price refers to the LPG international price of the preceding month. The LPG operating price is adjusted on February 1 and June 1 annually according to the average movement of the Composite Consumer Price Index and the Nominal Wage Index.

  The auto-LPG ceiling prices for respective dedicated LPG filling stations in July 2025 are as follows:

啟德體育園六月二十七至二十九日演唱會特別交通及運輸安排,2025-06-25 10:00,2025-06-25 10:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/25/P2025062400591.htm,"運輸署今日（六月二十五日）表示，為配合六月二十七至二十九日晚上於啟德體育園舉行的演唱會，將實施特別交通及運輸安排便利觀眾往返。來港觀看演唱會的內地觀眾應及早購票和妥善計劃行程，使用港鐵或跨境巴士服務往返。

活動期間，體育園附近一帶的交通預期會較繁忙，觀眾應乘搭公共交通工具，避免駕駛或乘搭私家車（包括跨境私家車）前往。

運輸署已協調本地及跨境公共運輸服務營辦商在離場時段加強服務。港鐵將會加密屯馬綫的班次，專營巴士公司將於宋皇臺道上落客區提供共11條特別巴士路線分別前往落馬洲（新田）公共運輸交匯處、港珠澳大橋香港口岸和機場及港九新界各主要地區。

另外，園方將於離場時段安排跨境巴士服務，便利旅客經落馬洲／皇崗口岸、港珠澳大橋和深圳灣口岸返回內地。乘客需預先購票，離場後現場不設售票。票務詳情以營辦商網頁為準（永東直巴：www.myeebus.com/eebusfans；中旅巴士：m.hkctgbus.com/#/layout/home）。

至於的士服務，啟德主場館的士上落客區將開放予的士上落客。宋皇臺道上落客區在進場時段（下午四時至七時）只開放予的士落客，離場時段則暫停的士上落客。由於預計離場人士眾多，輪候時間會較長，請耐心輪候登車。

計劃在演唱會完結後即日返回內地的觀眾需特別注意，如經羅湖口岸過關，需趕及港鐵屯馬綫最後一班相關列車，即於晚上十時五十九分由宋皇臺站及十一時○一分由啟德站開出的列車，並於大圍站轉乘東鐵綫往羅湖站。旅客應妥善規劃行程，提前前往車站月台。

使用落馬洲／皇崗口岸（全日24小時通關）過關的旅客，亦可乘搭東鐵綫往上水站轉乘九巴第276B或N73號線，或直接在宋皇臺道上落客區乘搭特別巴士第SP12號線往落馬洲（新田）公共運輸交匯處，轉乘落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）返回內地。

運輸署發言人表示，由於或有大量旅客在演唱會後使用落馬洲／皇崗口岸，加上六月二十八日晚上亞洲國際博覽館亦會舉行演唱會，預計該口岸將十分繁忙，請耐心等候過關。為確保公共交通服務暢順，活動期間午夜十二時後，落馬洲／皇崗口岸將按需要設公共交通專用通道，確保皇巴及跨境巴士行車暢通，更有效疏導大量跨境旅客；其他跨境私家車及其乘客輪候過關時間預計會較長。署方已督導相關營辦商預留足夠車輛和人手，應對乘客需求。

觀眾請留意場地廣播和「離場易」平台（easyleave.police.gov.hk）提供的實時資訊，以及經運輸署網頁（www.td.gov.hk）、「香港出行易」流動應用程式、電台和電視台發放的最新交通消息。"
Special traffic and transport arrangements for Kai Tak Sports Park concerts on June 27 to 29,2025-06-25 10:00,2025-06-25 10:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/25/P2025062400590.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (June 25) said that, to facilitate the holding of concerts at the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) on the evenings of June 27 to 29, special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented to provide convenience for spectators to travel to and from the KTSP. Concertgoers from the Mainland are urged to purchase tickets in advance, plan their journeys early and use the MTR or cross-boundary coach services.

  During the event period, as the traffic in the vicinity of the KTSP is expected to be heavy, concertgoers should opt for public transport, avoid driving or taking private cars (including cross-boundary private cars).

  The TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators to strengthen their services during dispersal. The MTR will enhance the interval between trains of the Tuen Ma Line (TML). Franchised bus companies will provide a total of 11 special bus routes at the Sung Wong Toi Road Pick-up/Drop-off Area (PUDOA) to Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange (PTI), the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Hong Kong Port and Airport, and major districts across the territory.

  In addition, the KTSP will arrange cross-boundary coach services during dispersal to facilitate travellers' return to the Mainland via the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang (LMC/HG) Port, the HZMB and the Shenzhen Bay Port. Passengers should purchase tickets in advance. On-site ticket sales will not be available during dispersal. They should refer to the operators' website (Eternal East Bus: www.myeebus.com/eebusfans; CTG Bus: m.hkctgbus.com/#/layout/home) for the latest ticket information.

  For taxi services, the Kai Tak Stadium Taxi PUDOA will be open for taxi pick-up and drop-off. The Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA will be open for taxi drop-off only during admission (4pm to 7pm) and suspended from taxi pick-up/drop-off during dispersal. The expected waiting time will be longer amid an outflux of spectators and passengers' patience is appreciated.

  Concertgoers who plan to return to the Mainland on the same day after the concert should pay special attention that, if they use the Lo Wu Control Point, they should catch the last relevant MTR TML train departing from Sung Wong Toi Station at 10.59pm and Kai Tak Station at 11.01pm, followed by interchanging at Tai Wai Station on the East Rail Line (ERL) to Lo Wu Station. Travellers should plan their journeys ahead and arrive at the station platform in advance.

  Travellers who opt for LMC/HG Port (operating 24 hours daily) may also take the ERL to Sheung Shui Station and then KMB route No. 276B or N73, or take the special bus route No. SP12 directly at the Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA to the Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) PTI, and transfer to the LMC-HG cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) for their journey to the Mainland.

  A spokesman for the TD said that, as a large number of travellers may use the LMC/HG Port after the concert, and concerts will also be held at AsiaWorld-Expo on the evening of June 28, the Port is expected to be very busy. Travellers' patience is appreciated. To ensure the smooth operation of public transport services, dedicated public transport lanes will be arranged at the LMC/HG Port after midnight during the event period when necessary for the smooth operation of the Yellow Bus and cross-boundary coach services as well as effective dispersal of a large number of cross-boundary travellers. Other cross-boundary private cars and their passengers are expected to have a longer clearance time. The TD has steered operators to reserve standby vehicles and manpower to meet passengers' demand.

  Spectators are advised to heed the real-time information via the on-site broadcast and the ""Easy Leave"" platform (easyleave.police.gov.hk) as well as the latest traffic news through the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk), the ""HKeMobility"" mobile application and radio and television broadcasts."

商經局局長在法國巴黎出席中國論壇（附圖）,2025-06-25 09:00,2025-06-25 09:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/25/P2025062500007.htm,"商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺於六月二十四日（法國時間）在法國進行最後一日訪問。他在巴黎出席由法國商務投資署舉辦的中國論壇，向當地商界推廣香港作為進入亞洲和內地市場門戶的優勢和獨特角色。

丘應樺在論壇上致辭時表示，目前全球經濟增長有六成源自亞洲，而亞洲市場，尤其內地市場為有意在環球貿易格局中拓展版圖的企業提供獨特機遇。香港作為連接海外投資者和內地市場的「超級聯繫人」，是法國企業開拓內地市場的理想跳板。

丘應樺指，二○二四年，香港的貿易總額達13,500億美元，是全球第五大貿易經濟體，而每年均有大量內地與世界各地的貿易經香港進行。此外，在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》（CEPA），這份內地迄今最開放的自由貿易協定下，香港企業和專業人士可以最優惠待遇進入內地市場。CEPA對資金來源亦不設限制。他鼓勵法國商界在港設立公司，通過CEPA的優惠政策拓展內地市場。

丘應樺續說，香港實行簡單低稅制，資金可自由進出，除了內地市場外，法國企業更可利用香港作為亞洲地區的營運基地，進軍東南亞市場。此外，香港正深化與中東和東南亞國家聯盟成員的貿易關係，並探索中亞地區，以拓展新興市場。

丘應樺總結時表示，香港已與法國建立緊密聯繫，法國社群是香港最大和最成功的群體之一。在歐盟成員國中，法國是香港第三大商品貿易及第二大服務貿易夥伴。他相信香港與法國的貿易潛力甚大，可發揮協同效應和達致互利共贏。

在巴黎期間，丘應樺亦禮節性拜會中國駐法國大使館公使陳棟，介紹香港的最新經貿發展，以及多項新舉措包括減免烈酒稅以推動烈酒貿易。

此外，丘應樺到訪Elior Group SA的總部及設施，了解該企業的營運情況和業務發展。他其後與法國香港商會的代表晚宴，了解當地企業的最新發展方向，並就加強香港與法國兩地的合作交換意見。

轉往巴黎前，丘應樺於六月二十三日（法國時間）到訪雅文邑一個酒莊，並與雅文邑業界代表會面，推廣香港作為烈酒貿易樞紐的優勢。

丘應樺於六月二十五日（法國時間）啓程返港。"
"SCED attends China Forum in Paris, France (with photos)",2025-06-25 09:00,2025-06-25 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/25/P2025062500010.htm,"The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, continued with the last day of his visit to France on June 24 (France time). He attended the China Forum organised by Business France in Paris to share with the business sector Hong Kong's advantages and unique role as a gateway to the Asian and Mainland markets.

 Speaking at the forum, Mr Yau remarked that Asia is currently contributing 60 per cent to global growth, and that the Asian market, in particular the Mainland market, presents a unique opportunity for businesses looking to expand their horizons across the global trade landscape. As a ""super connector"" between foreign investors and the Mainland market, Hong Kong serves as a perfect springboard for French businesses to tap into the Mainland market.

 Mr Yau said that in2024, Hong Kong's total trade amounted to US$1,350 billion, and was the world's fifth-largest trading entity. Every year Hong Kong channels a massive volume of trade between the Mainland and the rest of the world. Meanwhile, under the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), the most liberal free trade agreement ever offered by the Mainland, Hong Kong enterprises and professionals can enjoy the most preferential access to the Mainland market. CEPA is also nationality neutral and does not impose any restrictions on the source of investments. He encouraged the French business sector to set up company in Hong Kong to enjoy the preferential treatment under CEPA to enter the Mainland market.

 Mr Yau added that Hong Kong has a simple and low tax system and there is no restriction on the flow of capital. In addition to the Mainland market, French businesses can also access the Southeast Asian market by using Hong Kong as a base for their regional operations in Asia. Hong Kong is also deepening its trade ties with the Middle East and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries, and is reaching out to Central Asia to explore new markets.

 Mr Yau concluded that Hong Kong already has strong links with France, adding that the French community is one of the largest and most successful in Hong Kong. Among the European Union member states, France is the third largest in merchandise trade with Hong Kong and second largest in services trade. He believes that there is still significant trade potential between Hong Kong and France that would bring better synergy and mutual benefits.

 During his stay in Paris, Mr Yau also paid a courtesy call on Minister of the Chinese Embassy in France Mr Chen Dong to update him on Hong Kong's latest economic and trade developments, and new initiatives such as the reduction of liquor duty to promote liquor trading.

 Mr Yau also visited the headquarters of Elior Group SA and its facilities to learn about the company's operation and business development. He then hosted a dinner for representatives of theFrance Hong Kong Business Associationto learn about the latest development directions of local enterprises and exchange views on enhancing co-operation between Hong Kong and France.

 Before proceeding to Paris, Mr Yau visited a wine cellar in Armagnac and met with representatives of the Armagnac trade on June 23 (France time) to promote the advantages of Hong Kong as a liquor trading hub.

 Mr Yau will depart for Hong Kong on June 25 (France time)."

""The public should carry and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration while engaging in outdoor activities,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

""Those engaged in strenuous outdoor activities should avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcohol, as they speed up water loss through the urinary system,"" the spokesman explained.

""Infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and individuals who are overweight are more vulnerable to heat stroke. They should pay special attention,"" the spokesman added.

The public should adopt the following precautions:


Wear loose and light-coloured clothing to reduce heat absorption and facilitate sweat evaporation and heat dissipation;
Avoid vigorous exercise and prolonged activities like hiking or trekking as heat, sweating and exhaustion can place additional demands on the physique;
Perform outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible;
For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;
Apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen product with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply every two hours if you need to stay outdoors for a prolonged period, or after swimming, sweating or towelling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear long-sleeved and loose-fitting clothes; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

He was certified dead later in hospital. The LD is saddened by death of the worker and expresses its deepest sympathy to his family.

The LD's spokesman said, ""We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and have issued a suspension notice to the employer concerned, suspending the use of the relevant tail lift. The employer cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that suitable measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken.""

The spokesman added, ""We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the relevant duty holder and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation.""
  
To prevent employees from falling from the tail lift of a truck while working thereon, the LD reminds employers to take suitable safety measures, including providing an effective fall protective system to relevant employees and ensuring them to take the related fall protective measures; and affixing warning notices at prominent positions to alert employees of the falling hazards.

The general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance require employers to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

In regard to today's accident, the LD will issue a Work Safety Alert through its mobile application ""OSH 2.0"", website and email, giving a brief account of the accident concerned to duty holders, workers' unions, professional bodies of safety practitioners and others, and reminding the industry of the importance of following safety precautionary measures to prevent a recurrence of similar accidents.

The LD will also remind the employer concerned of the liability for employees' compensation under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, assist family members of the deceased to claim employees' compensation and closely follow up on the case. For those with financial difficulties, the LD will assist them to apply for appropriate emergency funds. Subject to the needs and wishes of family members of the deceased, the LD will also liaise with the Social Welfare Department for financial or other assistance.

For the sake of securing the safety and health of employees at work, the LD appeals to employers to provide plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health. Employees should also co-operate with their employers, adopt all safety measures and use personal protective equipment provided properly to avoid endangering their own work safety and that of other workers."

  Safeguarding national security is the Government's responsibility, as well as the obligation of the whole community of Hong Kong. It is also part and parcel of the routine school work in promoting national security education. With the implementation of the National Security Law for five years, Hong Kong has transited ""from chaos to stability"" and ""from stability to prosperity"". The EDB has adopted a ""multi-pronged and co-ordinated"" approach, including activities inside and outside the classroom, to strengthen students' understanding of Chinese culture, the Constitution and the Basic Law, and their awareness of law-abiding in promoting patriotic education.

  The EDB has issued detailed administrative and educational guidelines to schools, requiring them to establish school-based mechanisms and formulate appropriate measures according to their own circumstances and needs to implement various tasks related to safeguarding national security and national security education. The EDB also provided schools with an updated ""National Security: School Self-evaluation Checklist"" in April this year, and provided suggestions of refinement and good practices of different areas of work, covering national security work planning, monitoring mechanisms, learning and teaching and related resources, school activities, personnel management and training, and home-school co-operation, in order to effectively prevent and suppress acts and activities that endanger or are detrimental to national security. Schools have the responsibility to play a good gate-keeper role and to enhance the sensitivity of teachers and students to national security.

  Schools offering non-local curricula also have the responsibility to help their students, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, acquire a correct and objective understanding and appreciation of the concept of national security and the National Security Law, as well as the duty to cultivate a law-abiding spirit among their students. These schools should devise and continuously review relevant strategies and measures in light of their school-based circumstances and needs, with a view to maintaining a safe and orderly learning environment and promoting students' effective learning and healthy development.

  The EDB will continue to monitor and support schools in implementing the relevant work through various channels, such as daily communication with schools. The EDB will also advance towards more in-depth and effective implementation of work to safeguard national security, and continue to work hand in hand with different stakeholders to help schools build a protective barrier to safeguard the well-being of students."

維護國家安全是政府的責任，更是香港全社會的應有之義，推廣國家安全教育亦是學校的恆常工作。隨着《香港國安法》實施已經五年，香港社會實現「由亂到治」，走向「由治及興」。教育局採取多重進路互相配合的方式，包括在課堂內外的活動，加強學生對中華文化、《憲法》和《基本法》的認識及守法意識等，推進愛國主義教育。

教育局已向學校發出詳細的行政和教育指引，要求學校按校本情況及需要，建立校本機制和制定適當措施，以落實各項與維護國家安全及國家安全教育相關的工作。教育局亦已於今年四月向學校提供更新的《國家安全：學校自評檢視表》，就不同工作範圍提供優化建議和良好做法，內容涵蓋國家安全工作規劃、監察機制、學與教及相關資源、學校活動、人事管理及培訓和家校合作，藉以防範和制止危害國家安全或不利於國家安全的行為和活動。學校有責任做好把關角色，提高師生對國安的敏感度。

提供非本地課程的學校亦有責任協助學生（不論其種族或國籍）正確及客觀地理解及認識國家安全概念和《香港國安法》，建立守法的精神。這些學校應按校本情況及需要，制定並持續檢視相關策略及措施，為學生締造安全有序的學習環境，促進學生有效學習及健康成長。

教育局會持續通過不同渠道例如與學校的日常溝通，監察和支援學校落實有關工作。教育局亦會走深和走實維護國家安全工作，並繼續與不同持份者攜手同心，幫助學校建立保護屏障，保障學生福祉。"

An occasion to thank businesses for their trust and support in Hong Kong's business environment, the event attracted nearly 350 senior representatives from companies worldwide. The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, officiated at the ceremony, reaffirming Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" connecting the Mainland and the rest of the world. He also encouraged companies to seize the myriad opportunities in Hong Kong to expand globally.

 In his keynote speech, Mr Lee said that under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong enjoys the advantages of being connected to both the Mainland and the rest of the world, offering an open and easy place to do business, a long and established tradition of the rule of law, and a simple and low tax regime. Mr Lee highlighted that as the world's freest economy and one of the world's top three international financial centres, Hong Kong's global competitiveness has risen two places to rank third globally in the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025, marking the second consecutive year of such advancement from its seventh place two years ago. In the recent World Investment Report released by the United Nations Trade and Development, the city has moved up to the third place in terms of foreign direct investment inflows. Mr Lee said that the Government will continue to co-ordinate the practical needs of enterprises across different sectors, enabling them to develop their business overseas through Hong Kong's multinational supply chain management centre and explore new strategic blue oceans for development.

 This year, the reception not only expressed appreciation to the attending companies for their contributions to Hong Kong, but was also held to mark a significant milestone - the 25th anniversary of InvestHK. The department premiered its 25th anniversary video, celebrating its achievements and economic impact over the past quarter century, in the presence of Mr Lee; the Acting Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Dr Bernard Chan; the Permanent Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Ms Maggie Wong, and other distinguished guests.

 The Director-General of Investment Promotion, Ms Alpha Lau, thanked InvestHK's clients, partners, stakeholders, and other government bureaux and departments for their staunch support. She said, ""For a quarter-century, we have helped international companies from around the world establish, grow, thrive here and beyond, to Mainland China and Asia. We are also the launchpad for Mainland companies to go global. InvestHK actively promotes two-way foreign direct investment between China and the rest of the world, using Hong Kong as a platform. Looking forward, we will continue to connect markets, empower growth, and create long-term value through two-way investment.""

In the morning, Mr Chan, leading representatives from about 20 start-ups from the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, Cyberport and the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, visited the Tianjin Binhai High-tech Industrial Development Area.

Customs officers intercepted the 55-year-old incoming male passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on June 13 and seized 6 389 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $29,000 and a duty potential of about $21,000 from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

A 27-year-old male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Amsterdam, Netherlands, today. During Customs clearance, the batches of suspected ketamine and suspected MDMA were found in his rucksack, carry-on travel bag and carry-on suitcase. The man was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Court tomorrow (June 25).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

HKSAR Search and Rescue Team and Inter-departmental Preparation Team for Kai Tak Sports Park Commissioning both awarded Chief Executive's Award for Exemplary Performance,2025-06-24 19:40,2025-06-24 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400743.htm," The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government announced today (June 24) that the HKSAR Search and Rescue Team to quake-stricken areas in Myanmar in March 2025 and the Inter-departmental Preparation Team for Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) Commissioning were awarded a new round of the Chief Executive's Award for Exemplary Performance.

 The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, congratulated the two award-winning teams andexpressed pride in their performance and contributions. He said, ""The two award-winning teams reflected the outstanding competence of the civil service of the HKSAR and the efficiency of the Government, and exemplified Hong Kong's second-place global ranking in the 'Government efficiency' factor of the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025. All these have confirmed and reinforced my belief in driving result-oriented policies for the Government.""

 Congratulating the two award-winning civil service teams, the Secretary for the Civil Service, Mrs Ingrid Yeung, said, ""The HKSAR Search and Rescue Team has demonstrated fearless professionalism and humanitarian care, while the Preparation Team for KTSP Commissioning has displayed efficient collaboration and precise planning of the civil servants. The two teams comprised outstanding civil servants across different departments and grades, who overcame numerous challenges and accomplished their tasks with utmost professionalism. I hope that this honour will inspire more colleagues to forge ahead and continue to serve the community with dedication.""

 In March this year, a 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar, resulting in serious casualties. The HKSAR Government quickly formed an interdepartmental search and rescue team. Civil servants from the Security Bureau, the Fire Services Department and the Immigration Department, together with medical representatives from the Hospital Authority, and bringing along two search and rescue dogs and rescue equipment of about 9 tonnes, rushed to Mantalay, one of the most devastated areas in Myanmar, to conduct search and rescue operations.

 With professional training, fearlessness and perseverance, the HKSAR Search and Rescue Team completed 61 search and rescue operations covering 57 locations amid the constant aftershocks and scorching heat in the disaster-stricken areas. The team conducted joint operations with the China Search and Rescue Team and successfully rescued one survivor who had been trapped for more than 125 hours. In addition, the HKSAR Search and Rescue Team found two bodies under the debris. This is the second international rescue work the HKSAR Search and Rescue Team participated in since the earthquake in Türkiye in 2023, and the team has further upgraded its search and rescue techniques and equipment, including the application of AI and various advanced technologies, which help rescue personnel formulate more effective operational strategies.

 The KTSP is the largest sports infrastructure project ever commissioned in Hong Kong and was officially opened on March 1 this year. To ensure the smooth operation of the KTSP upon its commissioning, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, the Security Bureau, the Civil Service Bureau, the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the Hong Kong Police Force and the Transport Department had formed an interdepartmental preparation team to carry out the large-scale preparatory work in a concerted manner.

 In the face of multiple challenges such as the pressing schedule, the large scale of the project and complicated co-ordination work, the Preparation Team, with its innovative thinking, meticulous planning and interdepartmental collaborations, completed around 20 test events, including five large-scale drills, in just five months, mobilising 140 000 civil servants to participate in the stress tests to evaluate the capability of the KTSP and its surrounding facilities comprehensively. Through continuous stress tests and optimisation of detailed arrangements, thorough preparation was made for the commissioning of the KTSP.

 Details of the Chief Executive's Award for Exemplary Performance Presentation Ceremony will be announced later.

 The current-term Government launched the Chief Executive's Award for Exemplary Performance Scheme in 2023 to give recognition to meritorious and exemplary teams or individuals in the civil service, with a view to encouraging civil servants to continuously strive for excellence. It also aims to allow the public to have a better understanding of the Government's work and the excellence of the civil service.

 The nomination exercise for the new round of the Chief Executive's Award for Exemplary Performance commenced in May this year. The Civil Service Bureau invited bureaux to nominate outstanding teams or colleagues for the honour. The response was very positive, and bureaux actively nominated outstanding teams in recognition of their outstanding performance in different areas.

 The selection process was rigorous. After being made by the respective Directors of Bureaux, the nominations were each considered by a high-level selection committee of the Government, which then put forward its recommendations to the Chief Executive. After considering the committee's recommendations, the Chief Executive made his decision on the teams or individuals to be awarded."
​民政及青年事務局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-06-24 19:10,2025-06-24 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400734.htm,"​以下是民政及青年事務局（民青局）局長麥美娟今日（六月二十四日）出席「藝聚大街小巷 x Meeting of Styles（香港站）啟動典禮」後會見傳媒的談話內容：

民政及青年事務局局長：我很感謝德天社會企業、D2 Place、羅氏集團在深水埗社區舉辦一個這麼有意義的活動，找來不同的藝術家在社區內的外牆畫圖畫，為深水埗社區增添文化氣息。更重要的是，透過這個活動讓不同的居民和族群一起參與，充分體驗共融的概念。他們的作品於今年約十一月便會展出，在深水埗不同角落都可以看到，希望到時市民可以來欣賞。他們的作品在十一月展出的同時，正是民青局利用南昌社區中心其中一層，改裝成「連青人網絡」實體活動平台大概啓用的時候，到時候結合青年設施和這個文化計劃，可以真正令深水埗變成文青社區。我呼籲市民，尤其是青年朋友，屆時到深水埗區找尋自己的機會和興趣，享受社區內各種文化和共融元素。

記者：局長，想請教一下西貢區議員莊雅婷參選港姐。你事前是否知情？有沒有需要向區議會或者民政總署申報？你覺得她會勝出嗎？你支持她選港姐嗎？

民政及青年事務局局長：我今日看新聞報道留意到一位西貢區議員參加香港小姐選舉。我們現在還不知道選舉的過程和結果。無論如何，我們每一個區議員，不論職業、背景或來自哪個界別，他都要遵守《區議員履職監察制度指引》各項要求。正如大家都知道，今屆區議會，我們創造了歷來四個第一次，首先是第一次引入履職監察制度，確保每一個區議員都是盡責履職。第二，我們要確保全體區議員出席超過百分之八十的會議，這個出席率是歷屆之最。第三個第一次，是全體區議員在上任三個月內成立議員辦事處，並且每一個議員辦事處每星期的辦公時間會有幾個小時在非辦公時間辦公，方便街坊接觸和聯絡區議員。第四個第一次，是這一屆區議員全體有系統地提交工作報告介紹工作情況，向區議會主席報告工作情況。今屆我們有履職監察制度，無論區議員來自哪一個界別、職業或背景，他都必須按履職監察制度的要求和會議常規的規定，去盡責履職做好區議員的任務和工作。在四百多個區議員入面，大家有不同的專業和所長。有一些區議員可能也是運動健將，會參加運動比賽，甚至有些區議員會繼續進修。無論大家是在運動上參加競賽，或在學業上進修，或者如這位區議員般參加選美活動，無論他做甚麼，都要確保必須要按履職監察制度的所有要求和會議常規的所有規定去履行區議員的職務，這個是很清楚的。我們亦會嚴格確保每一個區議員按着要求去履職盡責，這才是現屆區議會最大的要求。

這一屆區議會我們很強調區議員和市民的接觸。區議會有一個會見市民計劃，而這個計劃已經做了數十年。多年前，區議員不是個個都有辦事處，那怎樣讓市民可以找到區議員呢？所以設有會見市民計劃，讓區議員到民政處或社區會堂會議室接見市民。今年我們推出一個加強版的會見市民計劃，我們設置一個流動會客室，區議員是要輪流當值，在街上設置流動會客室，我們走出會議室和辦公室，在街上直接接觸市民，去會見市民接受諮詢。我們這個計劃推出了兩個月左右，已經接受了九百多個居民的查詢和諮詢。我們每一個區議員，無論他是來自哪個界別，背景是甚麼，職業是甚麼，他都必須要盡責履職，按照我們的要求，包括要出席會議，要參加加強版的會見市民計劃，要當值會見市民和街坊。

記者：如果該位區議員真的入選，還可不可以做區議員？

民政及青年事務局局長：第一是看她的參選結果。但原則是不論這位區議員或其他區議員要參加甚麼活動或工作，因為四百多位區議員各有不同的背景和職業，他們必須要盡責履職。所以無論她的選舉結果如何，在整個過程或有結果後，她都必須要盡責履職，履行區議員職務。這是我們非常重視，也會確保每位區議員都盡責履職。

記者：你認為該位區議員因為參加港姐活動而缺席區議會會議，是否屬於豁免出席區議會會議的理由？

民政及青年事務局局長：按照《區議員履職監察制度指引》，如區議員不能出席會議，需要事前得到區議會主席的同意或批准。區議會主席會按甚麼原因同意？其實《區議會常規》寫得很清楚，其中一點最重要的是，不能參與會議的原因是否和執行區議會職務有關；或代表區議會參與會議；或因為在區內執行其他區議員職務而不能出席會議。另外一個特別的原因是身體健康問題，或可能家裏有白事。這些是很清楚的原因，區議會主席才會同意不出席會議。所以任何一位區議員，無論參與甚麼活動或工作也好，區議會主席都必須按照這幾個原則決定是否同意區議員不出席會議，而最終的原則是要確保每位區議員都盡責履職。

記者：區議員上任前是否需要宣誓效忠政府？她現在這樣做算不算是不夠用心？

民政及青年事務局局長：今屆所有區議員在二○二四年一月一日經過宣誓儀式就任，由行政長官出席儀式，並由我主持監誓。所以我們確保470位區議員都是愛國愛港人士，有熱誠參與區議會的工作。無論區議員參與甚麼活動、工作、競賽也好，必須要盡責履職，按照《區議員履職監察制度指引》和《區議會常規》履行區議員職務，謝謝各位。"

勞工及福利局局長就大班麵包西餅結業事件及補充勞工優化計劃會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-06-24 18:45,2025-06-24 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400709.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（六月二十四日）下午出席扶康會古洞成人訓練中心‧扶康會古洞之家聯合開幕典禮後，就大班麵包西餅結業事件及補充勞工優化計劃會見傳媒的談話內容：

勞工及福利局局長：歡迎大家今日來到扶康會古洞成人訓練中心‧扶康會古洞之家聯合開幕典禮，待扶康會入伙後，古洞北福利服務綜合大樓所有服務單位已悉數投入服務。大家有甚麼問題？

記者：局長，首先想問大班結業欠薪問題。勞工處暫時接到多少員工求助，能否聯絡僱主？有報道引述員工指出公司事前將分店現金調回總部，卻拖欠員工薪金，目前評估僱主有否濫用破產欠薪保障基金（破欠基金）可能性？近期很多連鎖食肆結業，是否擔心失業率會進一步上升？亦見到有保安公司結業，結業潮會否已開始蔓延到其他行業？會否優化輸入外勞計劃？

勞工及福利局局長：先談大家關心的大班麵包西餅結業事件。勞工處勞資關係科轄下10個分區辦事處均已設立特別櫃位，優先為受影響僱員提供服務。據我們掌握，大班麵包西餅有約200多名員工。截至中午，勞工處共接獲82名大班麵包西餅工友登記，相信陸續會有更多。他們求助主要包括未獲發五月及六月的工資，另外亦有結業後拖欠的遣散費及假期補償等，按他們表述，初步計算牽涉款額約1,000萬元，當然具體數字我們須再計算。我們會全力協助工友，當中包括協助他們申請破欠基金。經改善程序後基金申請已簡便得多，能為工友應急提供即時及必要的幫助。

第二點大家關心的是僱主方面，勞工處同事向我報告，這兩天均能聯絡大班麵包西餅負責人，並已向其告知在《僱傭條例》及相關勞工法例下僱主應負的責任，亦清楚表述僱主一旦確認無能力清付員工的薪金及應得費用，若願意簽署「無力償還書」，可加快整個破欠基金申請程序。此外，在協助工友的同時，我們亦會按程序調查僱主有否濫用破欠基金，並按機制處理針對有能力清付費用但濫用破欠基金程序的情況。此刻當務之急是先為受影響工友提供急需的幫助。

另外關於近日有店鋪結業，大家都明白香港經濟正處於轉型期，一方面經濟有百分之二至三的增長，亦見到有不同行業在香港投入服務；但另一方面確有行業面對不同經營環境選擇退出市場，但整體來說是有入有出的情況。

另一方面，我們已就補充勞工優化計劃推出改善措施，在此我亦想強調一點，輸入勞工只佔整體勞動人口約百分之一，對整體失業率影響很小。即使如此，我們仍要確保透過補充勞工優化計劃提出申請的僱主，完全嚴格按照我們要求，優先聘用本地工人。我不在此重複早前提出的四項改善措施，出發點是希望盡可能確保僱主優先聘用本地工人。至於本地工人若認為僱主聘用輸入勞工後將其解僱，或致其工作安排有巨大改變，我們設有投訴專線，另外亦可透過網上途徑向我們反映。我們會即時調查，若查明屬實，會毫不猶疑實施行政制裁。

記者：想問不少大班員工已有一定年紀，求職或面對困難，勞工處有何方法提供協助？

勞工及福利局局長：勞工處轄下設有勞資關係科及就業科。勞資關係科主要協助受影響工友通過申請破欠基金處理眼前困擾；就業科亦同時提供協助，為正在招聘人手的僱主提供轉介。有些受影響工友有一定年資，這代表他們在行內有豐富經驗，相信定有本地僱主希望具經驗工友加入其行列，就業科會第一時間協助提供相關服務。

記者：想問拖欠的薪金及長期服務金涉款共多少？

勞工及福利局局長：按員工估計，經初步計算，拖欠的薪金及其他應得款項包括遣散費涉及約1,000萬元，但實際款額需時計算，包括僱員今年五月一日前受僱期的年資衍生的遣散費，在現行安排下僱主仍可透過強制性公積金制度下的強制性供款累算權益進行對沖，因此須經計算後方能得出整體數目。無論如何，破欠基金確能作為應急機制，令受影響工友能較快取回應得的工資及其他勞工法例下應得的保障。

記者：入境處拘捕九名輸入勞工涉嫌在合約訂明以外地點工作，請問局長如何看這件事？

勞工及福利局局長：在補充勞工優化計劃下，輸入勞工的工作範圍及性質有清晰界定，不得超越標準僱傭合約訂明的職位及職務範圍。我們會按規矩處理，當然僱主亦有責任，因為輸入勞工的工作地點及職務範圍均有清晰規定。以飲食業為例，若獲聘輸入勞工的工作性質屬樓面，便只能從事樓面工作，若僱主安排其到食物工場工作屬違反規定，因為食物工場與樓面屬不同工作地點。我們有清晰規矩及明確要求，並會在巡查時加倍留意，確保大家按照既定規矩辦事。多謝大家。"

環境及生態局副局長黃淑嫻在啟動儀式致辭時表示，為配合國家「雙碳」目標，香港會繼續落實「淨零發電」、「節能綠建」、「綠色運輸」和「全民減廢」四大減碳策略，務求在二○三五年前將碳排放量由二○○五年的水平減半，並致力在二○五○年前實現碳中和。

黃淑嫻說：「推動『節能綠建』能降低用電量和發電需求，並幫助市民以至香港整體社會轉用更多清潔能源發電。《2025年建築物能源效益（修訂）條例草案》已在六月十一日獲立法會通過，不但加強本港建築物的能源效益管理制度，更有助達致三贏局面：一是為建築物節省電費、二是減少碳排放、三是促進綠色經濟發展，助力香港在二○五○年前實現碳中和。」

今年有超過3 400場所參與《節能約章2025》，承諾在盛夏期間（即六月至九月）把旗下物業的平均室內溫度維持在攝氏24至26度，會關掉不需要使用的電器，選購具能源效益的產品，促進可再生能源的使用，以及向員工和學生分享節能措施和成果。在《4T約章》方面，則有超過830個場所參與，通過訂立節能目標（target）、制定時間表（timeline）、增加數據透明度（transparency）和鼓勵同業參與（together）等方針加強節能。機電署會向參與機構發放相關創新科技資訊和安排講座，在實踐節能減排的同時，推動本港綠色科技發展。

啟動儀式上亦宣布推出《慳神節能挑戰盃2025》，鼓勵年輕人發揮創造和想像力，共同實踐節能措施，且更廣泛採用可再生及潔淨能源。《節能約章2025》、《4T約章》及《慳神節能挑戰盃2025》的詳情已上載至www.energysaving.gov.hk。"

Launching Ceremony for Energy Saving Charter 2025 and 4T Charter held today (with photos),2025-06-24 18:05,2025-06-24 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400288.htm,"âThe Environment and Ecology Bureau and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department held the Launching Ceremony for Energy Saving Charter 2025 and 4T Charter today (June24) to encourage the community to save energy, reduce carbon emissions and accelerate low-carbon transformation.

Speaking at the launching ceremony, the Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong, said that to align with the country's ""dual carbon"" target, the Government will continue to implement the four major decarbonisation strategies, namely net-zero electricity generation, energy saving and green buildings, green transport and waste reduction, to reduce Hong Kong's carbon emissions by half from the 2005 levels before 2035, and achieve carbon neutrality before 2050.

Miss Wong said, ""Promoting energy saving and green buildings can reduce power consumption and the demand for power generation, and help society transition to using more clean fuels for electricity generation. The Buildings Energy Efficiency (Amendment) Bill 2025, which was passed by the Legislative Council on June 11, not only improves the buildings energy efficiency management regime of Hong Kong, but also helps to achieve a win-win scenario of saving electricity costs for buildings, reducing carbon emissions, and boosting the development of the green economy, thereby assisting Hong Kong to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.""

This year, over 3 400 premises have signed up to the Energy Saving Charter 2025. They pledged to maintain the average indoor temperature at their premises between 24 and 26 degrees Celsius during the summer months from June to September, switch off appliances when not in use, procure energy-efficient appliances, promote the use of renewable energy, and share with staff and students energy-saving measures and achievements. As for the 4T Charter, over 830 premises have joined by setting an energy-saving target with an action timeline, enhancing data transparency and encouraging stakeholders to work together to enhance energy saving. The EMSD will provide participating organisations with information on relevant innovative technologies and arrange seminars, to promote the development of green technology in Hong Kong while practicing energy saving and reducing carbon emission.

The Energy Saving Competition for Students 2025 was also launched during the ceremony. It taps into the creativity and imagination of the younger generation for implementing energy-saving measures and adopting renewable and clean energy more extensively. Details of the Energy Saving Charter 2025, 4T Charter, and Energy Saving Competition for Students 2025 were uploaded to www.energysaving.gov.hk."

有關個案涉及二○二二年至二○二三年期間在日出康城首都一單位拆去部分結構牆的工程。屋宇署調查發現，負責涉事單位裝修的室內設計師及承建商明知而未事先獲得屋宇署批准及同意便進行工程，違反《建築物條例》第40（1AA）條。此外，該承建商拆去部分結構牆的方式相當可能導致任何人受傷或任何財產損毀的危險，違反《建築物條例》第40（2B）（b）條。屋宇署遂於去年五月根據《建築物條例》對有關室內設計師及承建商提出檢控，他們於今日在觀塘裁判法院被定罪，有關室內設計師及承建商分別被判罰款六萬元及二十萬元。

此外，屋宇署亦有就涉事單位業主違反《建築物條例》第40（1AA）及第40（2B）（b）條提出檢控，聆訊將延期至八月二十八日。

屋宇署發言人說，任何人如欲進行樓宇改動及加建工程，應先徵詢建築專業人士的意見，包括工程的可行性，以及按需要向屋宇署申請批准建築圖則及同意才可展開工程，以確保安全及不會違反《建築物條例》。建築專業人士及承建商亦須詳細查看批准圖則及其他相關文件，以及檢視《建築物條例》的相關規定和需否先得到屋宇署的批准才進行有關工程，以確保佔用人及樓宇結構安全。

根據《建築物條例》第40（1AA）條的規定，任何人明知而違反《建築物條例》第14（1）條（即在未事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，展開或進行任何建築工程），即屬犯罪，一經定罪，可處罰款四十萬元及監禁兩年，及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款二萬元。

根據《建築物條例》第40（2B）（b）條的規定，與相關建築工程直接有關的人，如進行或授權或准許該等工程，而工程進行方式相當可能導致任何人受傷或任何財產損毁的危險，即屬犯罪，一經定罪，可處罰款一百萬元及監禁三年。"

  âThe case involved the removal of part of a structural wall in a unit at The Capitol, Lohas Park, between 2022 and 2023. An investigation by the Buildings Department (BD) found that the interior designer and the contractor responsible for the renovation of the unit concerned knowingly carried out the works without prior approval and consent from the BD, thereby contravening section 40(1AA) of the BO. Moreover, the removal of part of the structural wall by the contractor was carried out in such a manner as was likely to cause a risk of injury to any person or damage to any property, thereby contravening section 40(2B)(b) of the BO. Hence, the BD instigated prosecution action under the BO against the interior designer and the contractor in May last year. The interior designer and the contractor were convicted and fined $60,000 and $200,000 respectively at the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Court today.

  âIn addition, the BD has also instigated prosecution action against the owner of the concerned unit for contravening sections 40(1AA) and 40(2B)(b) of the BO. The hearing is adjourned to August 28.

  âA spokesman for the BD said that any person who intends to carry out alteration and addition works should consult building professionals for advice, including the feasibility of the works, and where necessary, apply for approval and consent from the BD to ensure building safety and compliance with the Buildings Ordinance (BO). Building professionals and contractors are required to carefully examine the approved plans and other relevant documents to observe the relevant requirements under the BO, and to ascertain whether prior approval from the BD should be obtained before commencement of the works to ensure the safety of the occupants and the structural safety of the building.

  âPursuant to section 40(1AA) of the BO, any person who knowingly contravenes section 14(1) of the BO (i.e. commences or carries out any building works without having first obtained approval and consent from the BD) shall be guilty of an offence and liable upon conviction to a fine of $400,000 and to imprisonment for two years, and a further fine of $20,000 for each day that the offence continues.

  âPursuant to section 40(2B)(b) of the BO, any person directly concerned with the relevant building works, who carries out or authorises or permits such works to be carried out, in such manner that it is likely to cause a risk of injury to any person or damage to any property, shall be guilty of an offence and liable upon conviction to a fine of $1,000,000 and to imprisonment for three years."

DH investigates case of carbon monoxide poisoning caused by waterpipe smoking,2025-06-24 17:34,2025-06-24 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400593.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) today (June 24) is investigating a case of carbon monoxide poisoning caused by waterpipe smoking, and advised members of the public against smoking waterpipe or using other smoking products.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the DH received a notification from United Christian Hospital (UCH) that a 31-year-oldman lost consciousness and sustained head injury due to carbon monoxide poisoning after smoking waterpipe last Friday (June 20). After regaining consciousness, he went to UCH for treatment and was later discharged.

A preliminary investigation revealed that the man had used charcoal fuel to smoke waterpipe at a bar with closed door and no window.

The DH will continue to investigate the case.

The DH reminded the public that waterpipe is a smoking product and the combustion of its fuel (e.g. charcoal) releases high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Exposure to a low concentration of carbon monoxide can lead to a range of symptoms such as dizziness, headache, tiredness and nausea; while exposure to a high concentration of carbon monoxide can lead to impaired vision, disturbed co-ordination, unconsciousness, brain damage or even death. People should seek medical attention immediately if they suspect they are developing symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning.

A typical one-hour waterpipe smoking session exposes the smoker to 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke inhaled from a single conventional cigarette. Moreover, sharing a waterpipe apparatus increases the risk of transmitting infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis.

Carbon monoxide is a colourless, tasteless and odourless gas which is a by-product from incomplete combustion of fuels containing carbon, such as charcoal.To avoid carbon monoxide poisoning, members of the public are urged to use fuel-burning appliances properly and in a well-ventilated area. In 2023, a cluster of carbon monoxide poisoning incidents was linked to the use of waterpipe fuelled by charcoal.

In addition, the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Cap. 371) prohibits any person from conducting a smoking act in a statutory no smoking area (such as indoor areas of bars or restaurants). Any person conducting a smoking act in a statutory no smoking area is liable to a fixed penalty of $1,500.The Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office of the DH will follow up and investigate every complaint about illegal smoking, and will conduct inspections and enforcement actions at the venue concerned. The DH will continue to closely monitor and take stringent enforcement actions to tackle illegal waterpipe smoking.

The DH again urges the public not to smoke waterpipe. Furthermore, smoking is a major preventable cause of death. For health reason, members of the public should quit smoking now. They can call the DH's Integrated Smoking Cessation Hotline at 1833 183, or visit the thematic webpage (www.livetobaccofree.hk/en)."

紹興小百花越劇團七月為「中華文化節」獻演三場經典越劇（附圖）,2025-06-24 16:45,2025-06-24 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400477.htm,"  中國戲劇梅花獎二度梅得主吳鳳花聯同兩位梅花獎得主吳素英和陳飛，將率領紹興小百花越劇團的優秀演員，於七月赴港為康樂及文化事務署（康文署）策劃的「中華文化節2025」演出三場經典越劇《孔雀東南飛》、《沉香扇》和《穆桂英掛帥》，文采武韻兼備，戲迷不容錯過。此節目亦為第十三屆中國戲曲節節目之一。

  越劇，又名紹興戲，發源於浙江省紹興市嵊州，即古越國所在地，故稱越劇。越劇以板腔體及不同唱腔流派為主要特徵，歷年來各流派傳承下，培養出多位知名的越劇表演藝術家，如范瑞娟（范派）、傅全香（傅派）和呂瑞英（呂派）等，藝術造詣備受肯定。

  演出的詳情如下：

《孔雀東南飛》
——————————————————
日期及時間：七月十八日（星期五）晚上七時三十分

  《孔雀東南飛》被喻為「中國版羅密歐與茱麗葉」，講述焦仲卿和劉蘭芝二人被迫分離而雙雙殉情的淒美故事，乃范瑞娟和傅全香的代表作之一。今次演出由范派傳人吳鳳花與傅派傳人陳飛聯袂擔演，充分展現范派藝術的醇厚與質樸和傅派特有的婉轉俏麗。其中〈人去樓空空寂寂〉的經典唱段將古詩融合戲曲詞句，配上鑼鼓絲竹譜出二人之間的相思與無奈。

《沉香扇》
——————————————————
日期及時間：七月十九日（星期六）晚上七時三十分

  《沉香扇》是一部浪漫且詼諧的作品，由吳鳳花和呂派傳人吳素英擔演，劇情描述布衣才子徐文秀和尚書府千金蔡蘭英之間的跨門第愛情故事。在〈書房會〉一折，機敏聰慧的蔡蘭英與憨厚淳樸的徐文秀之間的對手戲喜感十足，為戲迷津津樂道的橋段。此劇唱腔悠揚婉轉，充分展現越劇藝術的獨特韻味。

《穆桂英掛帥》
——————————————————
日期及時間：七月二十日（星期日）晚上七時三十分

  《穆桂英掛帥》是紹興小百花越劇團「文武大戲」扛鼎之作，30餘年常演不衰，深受戲迷的喜愛與傳唱。此乃家傳戶曉的穆桂英與楊宗保比武招親及勇破天門陣的故事，既傳承越劇細膩婉轉的文戲精髓，亦融入大開大合的武戲氣魄。陳飛飾演的穆桂英剛柔並濟，唱腔激昂高亢，盡顯巾幗英雄氣概；飾演少年將軍楊宗保的吳鳳花則以長靠武生應工，一展其深厚的武戲功底。

  紹興小百花越劇團成立於一九八六年，其創排作品包括《李慧娘》、《狸貓換太子》、《屈原》等，並先後榮獲中國戲劇節劇目獎、中國越劇藝術節金獎和中國戲曲學會獎等。劇團活躍於江、浙、滬等地，亦曾赴香港、台灣、泰國和新加坡演出。

Xiaobaihua Yue Opera Troupe of Shaoxing to present three classic Yue opera performances for Chinese Culture Festival in July (with photos),2025-06-24 16:45,2025-06-24 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400482.htm,"  Wu Fenghua, a two-time recipient of the China Theatre Plum Blossom Award, along with fellow Plum Blossom Award winners Wu Suying and Chen Fei, will lead outstanding performers from the Xiaobaihua Yue Opera Troupe of Shaoxing to Hong Kong in July. They will present three Yue opera classics ""The Peacock Flies Southeast"", ""The Aloeswood Fan"" and ""Mu Guiying Takes Command"" for the Chinese Culture Festival (CCF) 2025, organised by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD). Blending literary grace and martial splendour, the performances are a must-see for opera enthusiasts. This programme is also part of the 13th Chinese Opera Festival (COF).

  Yue opera, also known as Shaoxing opera, originated in Shengzhou in Shaoxing city of Zhejiang Province, where the ancient kingdom Yue was located. It is mainly characterised by the Banqiang style (accompanied by small drum and wood clappers) and various schools of vocal styles. Over the years, each school has nurtured many renowned Yue opera performing artists such as Fan Ruijuan (Fan school), Fu Quanxiang (Fu school) and Lu Ruiying (Lu school), whose artistic accomplishments are widely recognised.

  Details of the performances are as follows:

""The Peacock Flies Southeast""
-----------------------------------------
Date and time: July 18 (Friday), 7.30pm

  ""The Peacock Flies Southeast"", dubbed the ""Chinese Romeo and Juliet"", recounts the poignant tragedy of Jiao Zhongqing and Liu Lanzhi, who are forced to be separated and ultimately choose to die for love. This masterpiece stands as one of the signature works of Yue opera legends Fan Ruijuan and Fu Quanxiang. This performance stars Wu Fenghua of the Fan school and Chen Fei of the Fu school, perfectly embodying the Fan school's profound simplicity and the Fu school's unique graceful vivacity. The classic aria ""The Lonely Chamber after That Person is Gone"" poetically blends ancient verse with operatic lyrics, accompanied by the interplay of gongs, drums and strings, expressing the lovers' yearning and resignation.

""The Aloeswood Fan""
-----------------------------------------
Date and time: July 19 (Saturday), 7.30pm

  ""The Aloeswood Fan"" is a romantic and witty play, starring Wu Fenghua and Wu Suying of the Lu School. The story depicts a cross-class love affair between Xu Wenxiu, a talented scholar from a humble background, and Cai Lanying, a daughter of a minister's family. One of the most beloved scenes, ""At the Study"", features a delightfully comedic interaction between the quick-witted Cai and the simple, honest Xu. With its melodious and graceful vocal artistry, the play showcases the distinctive artistic appeal of Yue opera.

""Mu Guiying Takes Command""
-----------------------------------------
Date and time: July 20 (Sunday), 7.30pm

  ""Mu Guiying Takes Command"" stands as a signature work of the Xiaobaihua Yue Opera Troupe of Shaoxing that consists of both civil and martial elements. It has remained popular for over 30 years and is deeply beloved by opera fans. The production tells the household legend of Mu Guiying and Yang Zongbao's martial contest for marriage and her heroic breaking of the Heavenly Gate Formation, fusing Yue opera's lyrical elegance with martial grandeur. Chen Fei's portrayal of Mu Guiying masterfully balances strength and grace, with passionate and soaring vocals that fully capture the heroine's indomitable spirit. Wu Fenghua, playing the young general Yang Zongbao, demonstrates her solid martial arts skills through her performance in a changkao wusheng (military male in full armour) role.

  The Xiaobaihua Yue Opera Troupe of Shaoxing was established in 1986. Its productions, including ""Li Huiniang"", ""How a Dead Cat was Substituted for a New-born Prince"", ""Qu Yuan"" and others, have received numerous awards such as the Repertory Award at the China Theatre Festival, the Gold Award at China Yue Opera Arts Festival and the China Xiqu Society Award. The troupe is active in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other regions, and has performed in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore.

  The three performances will be held at the Auditorium of Kwai Tsing Theatre. Lyrics and dialogue are with Chinese and English surtitles. Tickets priced at $220, $320, $420 and $520 are now available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288. Group booking discounts and package booking discounts are available for purchasing selected CCF stage programmes, the ""Chinese Opera Film Shows"" of the COF 2025 and the ""Legacy and Vision: Conversations with Chinese Cultural Masters"" lecture. For programme enquiries and concessionary schemes, please call 2268 7325 or visit www.ccf.gov.hk/en/programme/the-peacock-flies-southeast-chinese-version-of-romeo-and-juliet.

  A meet-the-artists session entitled ""Timeless Appeal: The Legacy and Evolution of Yue Opera"" (in Putonghua and Cantonese) will be held at 7.30pm on July 17 (Thursday) at AC2, Level 4, Administration Building, Hong Kong Cultural Centre. The speakers include Wu Fenghua, Wu Suying, Chen Fei and Yu Weiping, while Chinese opera researcher Chan Chun-miu will be the moderator. Admission is free and online registration is required (www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/Programme/en/chinese_opera/programs_1839.html#tab_13_0). If the quotas for online registration are full, those who are interested may wait at the venue's entrance for a standby quota on the day of the session.

交流會由律政司、財經事務及庫務局、投資推廣署主辦，廣東國際商會協辦，吸引逾四十家企業的代表出席。

代表團由香港律師會、香港大律師公會、香港交易及結算所（香港交易所）、銀行界以及粵港澳大灣區律師顧問小組的代表組成。會上，成員就香港作為國際法律樞紐及國際融資平台的獨特優勢、涉外融資常見的法律問題以及企業在「走出去」時如何保障知識產權等多個實務議題作專題介紹，並與內企代表深入交流。

張國鈞博士表示，律政司首次以「跨專業」的形式，聯動香港金融界、香港交易所與法律專業代表，以不同專業的角度向內地企業家闡述香港內聯外通的獨特優勢，讓企業了解「借港出海」是企業的最佳選擇。

他又指，企業在「出海」時，如果不完全掌握當地法律、市場規則及文化差異時，往往引發法律糾紛，甚至造成重大損失。因此，代表團成員亦特別針對企業「出海」時需留意的幾個重要課題，並與企業代表分享「瞎出海也出局」的總結經驗。要成功「出海」，企業需要優質涉外專業服務助力開闢「安全航道」，而香港的國際化專業服務正好成為企業拓展海外市場的重要夥伴。

會後，張國鈞博士隨即帶同法律界代表團成員與廣東省律師協會舉行座談，就兩地律師如何有效協助企業應對「出海」的法律實務問題交換意見。張國鈞博士即日返港。"
DSJ leads cross-professional delegation to Guangzhou to facilitate Mainland enterprises in leveraging Hong Kong to go global (with photos),2025-06-24 16:44,2025-06-24 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400512.htm,"  The Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, today (June 24) led a delegation comprising representatives from Hong Kong's legal and financial sectors to Guangzhou for a luncheon to exchange views with senior executives of Guangdong enterprises, promoting greater contributions by Hong Kong professional services to Mainland enterprises in going global.

  The exchange session, hosted by the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, and Invest Hong Kong, and co-organised by the Guangdong Chamber of International Commerce, attracted representatives from more than 40 enterprises to attend.

  The delegation consisted of representatives from the Law Society of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Bar Association, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), the banking sector and the Advisory Group of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Lawyers. During the session, members of the delegation delivered thematic presentations on various practical topics, including the unique advantages of Hong Kong as an international legal hub and financing platform, common legal issues in foreign-related financing, and protection of intellectual property rights in going global. They also had an in-depth discussion with representatives of Mainland enterprises.

  Dr Cheung said that it was the first time for the DoJ to adopt a cross-professional approach by bringing together representatives from Hong Kong's financial sector, the HKEX, and the legal profession to introduce Hong Kong's unique advantages in connecting the Mainland and the world to Mainland entrepreneurs from multiple professional perspectives, thereby enhancing enterprises' understanding of Hong Kong's position as the best gateway for global expansion.

  He also pointed out that enterprises, without full knowledge of local laws, market rules or the cultural differences, might face legal disputes or even significant losses when going overseas. Members of the delegation, therefore, focused on several important issues that enterprises should pay attention to before entering overseas markets. They also shared with enterprises the experience of others, highlighting that ""going overseas blindly"" would only bring failure. In fact, enterprises need quality foreign-related professional services to assist them in opening up a ""safe route"" for going global successfully, and Hong Kong's international professional services are positioned as key partners to enterprises expanding into overseas markets.

  After the session, Dr Cheung brought legal profession members of the delegation to hold a discussion with the Guangdong Lawyers Association, exchanging views on how lawyers from both places could effectively assist enterprises in addressing practical legal issues arising from going global. Dr Cheung returned to Hong Kong on the same day."

陳積志表示：「安居樂業是不少巿民的理想和目標。但是否能夠安居，須視乎物業管理服務的質素。物監局專責監管物業管理服務業，有責任帶領業界包括物管公司和從業員朝專業化優質化發展，為市民提供高質素的物業管理服務。有資料顯示物監局接獲投訴後，未能在該局網頁公布的六個月服務承諾時限內給予調查結果和回覆，只是重複表示仍在跟進個案。因此，我決定展開這項全面調查，詳細審研現時物監局處理及回覆巿民投訴的程序和機制，以及探討當中有否改善空間，提出適切改善建議，優化物監局為巿民提供的服務。」

申訴專員歡迎市民以書面提出意見。請於二○二五年七月二十四日或之前把意見送達申訴專員公署：

Ombudsman probes Property Management Services Authority's complaint handling mechanism (with photo),2025-06-24 16:15,2025-06-24 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400562.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (June 24) announced the launch of a full investigation into the procedures and mechanisms currently employed by the Property Management Services Authority (PMSA) in the handling of and replying to public complaints.

Established under the Property Management Services Ordinance, the PMSA is tasked to regulate the provision of property management services by companies and practitioners in Hong Kong and to promote the professional development of the industry. Complaints may be lodged against a licensee who is suspected to have committed a disciplinary offence or no longer meets any of the prescribed criteria for holding the licence (non-compliance). The PMSA may conduct an investigation in accordance with the Ordinance if it has reasonable cause to suspect that there is non-compliance. However, there is information showing that no result has been provided months after the PMSA received a complaint against a property management company, and in the meantime, the PMSA has not provided any update of its follow-up action, resulting in dissatisfaction.

Mr Chan said, ""It is the wish of many Hong Kong people to be able to live in peace and contentment. This strongly hinges on the quality of property management services. As a statutory regulatory body of the property management industry, it is incumbent on the PMSA to see to it that management companies and property management practitioners strive to enhance their professionalism and provide the public with high-quality property management services. The Office has noted that, contrary to the PMSA pledges stated on its website, the PMSA has failed to complete an investigation within six months and its interim replies are merely computer-generated templates. In this light, I have decided to launch a full investigation into the PMSA's current procedures and mechanisms for the handling of and replying to public complaints to identify any areas for improvement. Pertinent recommendations will be made for better services to be provided to the public.""

The Ombudsman welcomes views from members of the public on this topic. Written submissions should reach the Office of The Ombudsman by July 24, 2025:

Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-06-24 16:15,2025-06-24 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400558.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on June 23 to noon today (June 24), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 146 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 145 978 samples of food imported from Japan (including 95 893 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 33 342 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由六月二十三日中午截至今日（六月二十四日）中午，食安中心已對146個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

盧寵茂教授說︰「我感謝管委會及轄下中藥組多年來努力，排除萬難完成中成藥過渡性註冊制度這項歷史任務。香港註冊中成藥將會成為本港中醫藥發展和醫療創新其中一個重要環節，香港擁有完善的中成藥規管制度，其品牌效應可以吸引更多海內外優質中成藥來港註冊，協助中藥業進一步拓展國際市場，加速中醫藥國際化的進程。」

「國家近年致力推動中醫藥傳承創新發展，制訂多項與中醫藥相關的政策，當中包括簡化香港已上市傳統中成藥在內地上市註冊的審批安排，現時本港已有16款傳統外用中成藥透過簡化流程在內地上市註冊。香港的中成藥發展已進入新台階，正好配合國家中醫藥發展規劃。」

盧寵茂教授指出，是次工作順利完成，實有賴政府和業界的共同努力。衞生署為管委會提供全面的專業及行政支援，確保審批工作按照傳統中醫藥理論與現代科學兼備的嚴格要求進行。而中藥業界亦透過不斷完善生產和管理以滿足相關質量規定，充分展現對提升中醫藥品質的承擔。

為協助中成藥過渡性註冊持有人早日取得正式註冊，此前醫衞局透過中醫藥發展基金向業界提供資助，其中中成藥註冊支援計劃向中成藥過渡性註冊持有人給予資助，以聘請顧問就正式註冊提供意見及／或進行註冊所需之化驗。未來，政府會繼續與業界攜手，共同推動中醫藥的創新與發展。醫衞局將在今年底發布《中醫藥發展藍圖》，當中會包括更多全面提升本港中醫藥發展的策略。"

Secretary for Health welcomes conclusion of transitional registration system for proprietary Chinese medicines,2025-06-24 15:45,2025-06-24 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400371.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, today (June 24) welcomed the successful completion of the evaluation and approval procedures for all proprietary Chinese medicines (pCms) with transitional registration by the Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong (CMCHK). The transitional registration system for pCms will conclude on June 30, marking an important milestone for the regulation of Chinese medicine (CM) in Hong Kong, ensuring the public's access to quality and safe pCms, while also supporting Hong Kong's development as a bridgehead for the internationalisation of CM.

  Professor Lo said, ""I would like to express my gratitude to the CMCHK and its Chinese Medicines Board for their years of dedication in overcoming challenges to complete the historic task of the transitional registration for pCms. Hong Kong-registered pCms will become a key component in CM development as well as health and medical innovation. With Hong Kong's robust regulatory system for pCms, its brand effect can attract more high-quality pCms from the Mainland and overseas to register in the city, thereby assisting the industry in further expanding into global markets and accelerating the internationalisation of CM.

  ""In recent years, our country has been committed to promoting the inheritance and innovation development of CM with a number of CM-related policy initiatives formulated, including the streamlining of approval procedures for Hong Kong-registered traditional pCms to be registered on the Mainland. Currently, 16 traditional pCms for external use in Hong Kong have been approved for sale on the Mainland through the streamlined procedures. The development of pCms in Hong Kong has scaled new heights, aligning seamlessly with the national development plan for CM.""

  Professor Lo expressed that the successful completion of the work was attributed to the concerted efforts of the Government and industry. The Department of Health provided comprehensive professional and administrative support to the CMCHK, ensuring that the evaluation and approval procedures adhered to stringent requirements integrating traditional CM theories with modern science. Meanwhile, the CM industry demonstrated its commitment to enhancing the quality of CM by continuously enhancing production and management practices to meet relevant quality standards.

  To assist holders of transitionally registered pCms in obtaining formal registration as early as possible, the Health Bureau has previously provided funding to the industry through the Chinese Medicine Development Fund. Under the Proprietary Chinese Medicine Registration Support Scheme, subsidies were granted to holders of transitionally registered pCms to engage professional consultants for advice on formal registration matters and/or to conduct necessary laboratory tests. Moving forward, the Government will continue to collaborate with the CM industry to jointly promote the innovation and development of CM. The Health Bureau will release the Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint by the end of this year, which will include more strategies to comprehensively enhance the development of CM in Hong Kong."
衞生署正調查一宗因吸食水煙引致一氧化碳中毒個案,2025-06-24 15:31,2025-06-24 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400479.htm,"衞生署今日（六月二十四日）正調查一宗因吸食水煙引致一氧化碳中毒個案，並忠告市民不要吸食水煙或使用其他吸煙產品。

衞生署衞生防護中心接獲基督教聯合醫院（聯合醫院）通報，一名31歲男子上星期五（六月二十日）吸食水煙後，一度因一氧化碳中毒而失去知覺並撞傷頭部。他蘇醒後自行到聯合醫院求醫，經治療後已出院。

初步調查顯示，該名男子當日在一間酒吧內，使用炭燃料吸食水煙，當時涉事處所大門緊閉而且沒有窗戶。

衞生署會繼續調查事件。

衞生署提醒市民，水煙是吸煙產品，它所用的助燃物（如煤炭）在燃燒時會產生一氧化碳。曝露於低濃度一氧化碳的人士可能出現頭暈、頭痛、疲倦和噁心等症狀；而曝露於高濃度一氧化碳的人士則可能出現視覺受損、協調紊亂、失去知覺和腦部受損等症狀，甚至死亡。市民如懷疑出現一氧化碳中毒症狀，應立即求醫。

吸食一小時水煙的煙霧吸入量，可達一根傳統捲煙的100至200倍。同時，共用水煙器具會增加水煙使用者感染結核病等傳染病的風險。

一氧化碳是一種無色、無味、無臭的氣體，是任何含碳燃料（如煤炭）未完全燃燒時產生的副產品。市民應在通風良好的地方正確使用燃燒燃料的器具，以免一氧化碳中毒。二○二三年，本港亦錄得一宗與吸食炭燃料水煙引致一氧化碳中毒的個案群組。

此外，《吸煙（公眾衞生）條例》（第371章）（《條例》）禁止任何人於法定禁煙區（例如酒吧或食肆的室內區域）作出吸煙行為。任何人於法定禁煙區作出吸煙行為即屬違法，可被處定額罰款1,500元。衞生署控煙酒辦公室會就每一宗違例吸煙投訴作出跟進及調查，並會到有關場所巡查及執法。署方會繼續密切監察及持續嚴厲執法，以打擊非法吸食水煙活動。

衞生署再次呼籲市民切勿吸食水煙。此外，吸煙是可預防的主要死因。為健康起見，市民應立即戒煙。市民可致電衞生署戒煙綜合熱線1833 183查詢詳情，或流覽專題網頁(www.livetobaccofree.hk/tc)。"
香港中醫藥管理委員會宣布中成藥過渡性註冊制度六月三十日結束,2025-06-24 15:30,2025-06-24 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400270.htm,"下稿代香港中醫藥管理委員會（管委會）發出：

管委會今日（六月二十四日）宣布，中成藥過渡性註冊轉為正式註冊的審批工作已全部完成，而過渡性註冊中成藥制度將於六月三十日正式結束，屆時所有在香港銷售的中成藥均須持有效正式註冊，標誌着香港中醫藥監管體系踏入新階段。

根據《中醫藥條例》（第549章）（《條例》），所有中成藥必須經管委會轄下中藥組註冊，方可在香港銷售、進口或管有。中成藥註冊須符合中藥組就安全、品質及成效三方面的嚴格要求。為兼顧行業實際情況，政府早年實施過渡性安排︰允許於一九九九年三月一日已在港製造或銷售、並符合過渡性註冊資格的中成藥，持「確認中成藥過渡性註冊通知書」（HKP）在申請「中成藥註冊證明書」（HKC）期間繼續銷售。

過渡性註冊安排實施期間，中藥組累計受理14 172宗HKP申請，核准發出HKP共9 150宗，當中6 174宗成功獲發HKC。其餘2 976宗個案未獲HKC，原因包括申請人未能提交所需資料、自行撤回申請，或被取消HKP資格等。

鑑於業界需時適應註冊要求及疫情影響等因素，中藥組此前數度延長提交註冊資料期限。二○二四年二月，中藥組作出最終決定︰所有HKP轉HKC個案須於二○二五年六月三十日或之前完成，逾期個案的HKP會被取消，相關產品不得繼續在港銷售、進口或管有。

市民如有需要核對註冊中成藥的資料，可查閱香港中醫藥管理委員會的網頁。

管委會主席胡梁子慧說：「我衷心感謝中藥組多年來的努力以及業界的全力配合，完成這個歷史性任務。中成藥過渡性註冊制度的圓滿結束，標誌着目前在香港銷售的中成藥均已嚴格符合三項核心註冊要求－－安全、品質及成效性，並充分滿足《條例》對藥品包裝及說明的規範，進一步加強對市民健康的保障。中成藥註冊制度的全面實施不僅增強了社會各界對香港中藥監管體系的信心，更有力推動本地中藥產業的可持續發展，進一步鞏固香港作為中醫藥國際化重要樞紐的戰略地位。」"
Chinese Medicine Council announces that transitional registration of proprietary Chinese medicines will end on June 30,2025-06-24 15:30,2025-06-24 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400271.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong (CMCHK):

The CMCHK announced today (June 24) that the evaluation and approval process for converting the transitional registrations of proprietary Chinese medicines (pCm) to formal registrations has been completed. The transitional registration system for pCm will come to an end on June 30. By then, all pCms sold in Hong Kong must have valid formal registrations, marking a new chapter in the regulatory regime of Chinese medicine in Hong Kong.

According to the Chinese Medicine Ordinance (Cap. 549), all pCms must be registered with the Chinese Medicines Board (CMB) under the CMCHK before they can be sold, imported or possessed in Hong Kong. The registration of pCm must comply with the stringent requirements of the CMB in respect of safety, quality and efficacy. Taking into account the actual situation of the trade, the Government implemented a transitional measure in the past. PCms manufactured or sold in Hong Kong as of March 1, 1999, and meeting the eligibility criteria for transitional registration, were allowed to continue to be sold during the application period for ""Certificate of registration of pCm"" (HKC) with a ""Notice of confirmation of transitional registration of pCm"" (HKP).

During the implementation of the transitional registration arrangement, the CMB processed a total of 14 172 cases of HKP applications and approved 9 150 for issuance of HKP. Among these cases, 6 174 cases were successfully issued with HKC, while the remaining 2 976 cases were not issued with HKCs due to reasons such as the applicants' failure to submit the required information, withdrawal of applications by the applicants, or revocation of the HKPs, among others.

In view of the time taken by the trade to adapt to the registration requirements and the impact of the pandemic, the CMB extended the deadline for submission of registration information on a number of occasions. In February 2024, the CMB made a final decision that all applications for HKC from HKP must be completed by June 30, 2025. After that, HKP will be revoked for overdue cases, and the products concerned will not be allowed to be sold, imported, or possessed in Hong Kong.

Members of the public who need to verify the information of pCms can visit the CMCHK's website.

The Chairman of the CMCHK, Mrs Jeanie Hu, said, ""I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the CMB for its efforts over the years and the full co-operation of the trade in accomplishing this historic task. The successful completion of the transitional registration for pCm signifies that all pCms currently sold in Hong Kong have strictly complied with the three core registration requirements - namely, safety, quality and efficacy - and fully met the requirements of the Ordinance in respect of packaging and labelling. This further enhances the protection of public health. The full implementation of the pCm registration system has not only raised public confidence in the regulatory system for Chinese medicines in Hong Kong, but also promoted the sustainable development of the local Chinese medicine industry, further consolidating Hong Kong's strategic position as an important hub for the internationalisation of Chinese medicines."""

尊敬的于曉總裁（香港中國企業協會總裁）、陳文副總裁（中國銀行（香港）（中銀香港）副總裁）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今天我很高興來到這裏出席二○二五年「慶回歸中企金融服務進社區專題講座」的啟動禮。

今年的活動，不僅延續去年100場講座，更豐富主題為「財富攻守」，將最新的金融知識和防詐騙內容向社會各界傳播，實在是意義非凡。

政府一直積極推動普惠金融發展。我們透過政策引導和科技創新，讓社會不同階層市民都能享用便捷、安全的金融服務。

金管局亦一直與銀行業界合作，為社會不同群體，例如長者、殘疾人士及少數族裔等推出便利措施，簡化開戶流程、推廣電子銀行服務，使金融服務更方便、更「貼地」。

針對近年的詐騙案件，金管局與銀行業界推出了多項防護措施。當中，已經陸續在不同銀行推出的「智安存」，是一項重要的創新舉措。我很推薦「老友記」多使用這服務，我覺得這服務在防詐騙方面是一個非常有效的服務。市民可以將部分存款分隔保護，就好像放在「夾萬」一樣。這些存款不能隨意轉出，即簡單而言，如果騙徒想透過自動櫃員機轉走金錢，是不可以的，必須經過銀行以反詐騙為重點的嚴格核實，才能動用，幫助長者守護他們的積蓄。

警方亦與銀行業界共同成立「反詐騙聯合情報中心」，加強攔截騙款、識別潛在騙案受害人；同時擴大「防騙視伏器」的數據應用，幫助市民辨識詐騙電話和網站，降低受騙風險。

我很高興看到中銀香港和一眾中資金融機構，與各區區議會合作無間，結合商界專業與地區網絡，將金融知識及防騙信息，精準傳遞至社區上的每一個角落。

我亦要特別感謝香港中國企業協會舉辦這個別具意義的慶回歸活動，讓我們在慶祝回歸的同時，亦將金融知識帶到基層，幫助長者、學童、新來港人士等不同群體。

為慶祝香港特別行政區成立28周年，政府與社會各界已經宣布推出一系列特別優惠及活動，涵蓋公共交通、文化藝術及消閒、飲食及消費等不同範疇。我希望廣大市民一同積極參與，共同慶祝特區成立28周年這個大好日子。

最後，我預祝這一系列共100場的專題講座圓滿成功，讓實用的金融知識走進社區，惠及每一位市民，共建一個更安全、更美好的香港！多謝大家！"

特區救援隊和啟德體育園開幕籌備專組同獲「行政長官表揚榜」殊榮,2025-06-24 14:55,2025-06-24 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400478.htm,"特區政府今日（六月二十四日）公布，新一輪「行政長官表揚榜」獎勵計劃的得獎隊伍為「2025年3月前赴緬甸地震災區救援的特區救援隊」（特區救援隊）及「啟德體育園開幕跨部門籌備專組」（啟德體育園開幕籌備專組）。

行政長官李家超恭賀兩支得獎團隊，為他們的表現和貢獻感到驕傲。他表示：「兩支得獎團隊反映了香港特區公務員的卓越能力和政府效率，更印證香港在《2025年世界競爭力年報》的『政府效率』因素中獲得全球第二的佳績，使我更相信我建立以結果為目標的政府的政策正確。」

公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵恭賀兩支獲獎的公務員團隊，她說：「特區救援隊展現了無畏無懼的專業精神和人道關懷；啟德體育園開幕籌備專組則展現了公務員團隊的高效協作和精準規劃。兩支團隊匯聚了不同部門和職系的優秀公務員，以專業態度克服重重挑戰，完成任務。我期望這份殊榮能激勵更多同事積極奮進，繼續竭誠為市民服務。」

今年三月，緬甸發生7.6級大地震，造成重大傷亡。特區政府迅速組織一支跨部門的救援隊伍，保安局、消防處及入境事務處的公務員團隊，聯同醫院管理局的醫護代表，帶同兩隻搜救犬及共重約九噸的救援工具，趕赴緬甸地震重災區之一曼德勒展開搜救工作。

在餘震不斷及酷熱高溫的災區環境下，特區救援隊憑藉專業的訓練、無畏精神及堅韌意志，完成了61次搜救行動，覆蓋57個地點，並與國家救援隊聯合行動，成功救出一名被困超過125小時的倖存者；特區救援隊亦挖掘出兩具遇難者遺體。今次行動是繼二○二三年土耳其地震後，特區救援隊第二次參與國際救援工作，無論在搜救技術或裝備上都進一步提升，包括應用人工智能及不同先進科技，有助救援人員制定更有效的行動策略。

啟德體育園是香港歷來最大型的體育基建，於今年三月一日正式開幕。為確保啟德體育園啟用時運作暢順，文化體育及旅遊局、保安局、公務員事務局、運輸及物流局、香港警務處及運輸署組成跨部門籌備專組，齊心協力，展開大規模籌備工作。

面對時間緊迫、項目規模龐大、協調工作複雜等多重挑戰，啟德體育園開幕籌備專組以創新思維、精密規劃和跨部門協作，在短短五個月內完成了約20場測試活動，當中包括五場大規模演練，動員約14萬人次公務員參與，全面測試啟德體育園和周邊設施的承載能力。通過不斷演練及持續優化細節安排，為啟德體育園的啟用作出了周全的準備。

「行政長官表揚榜」獎勵計劃頒獎典禮舉行詳情將於稍後公布。

本屆政府自二○二三年設立「行政長官表揚榜」獎勵計劃，公開表揚優秀模範的公務員團隊或人員，激勵公務員不斷求進，並讓公眾更清楚認識政府的工作及公務員團隊優秀的面貌。

「行政長官表揚榜」新一輪提名於本年五月展開，公務員事務局邀請各政策局提名優秀團隊或同事競逐殊榮。各政策局反應熱烈，積極提名優秀團隊以表揚它們在不同範疇的卓越表現。

遴選工作嚴謹，團隊或人員經政策局局長提名後，再由政府內部的一個高層次遴選委員會逐一考慮並向行政長官作出建議。行政長官在考慮遴選委員會的建議後作出決定，選出上榜團隊或人員。"

Reporter: Good morning, Mr Lee. With Director Xia Baolong (Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Xia Baolong) wrapping up his five-day visit last Sunday (June 22), what do you make of his visit, and what's the Government's plan in carrying out his expectations and wishes to Hong Kong? And the Government has raised the travel alert for Israel and Iran to black on last Thursday (June 19). What's your assessment on the situation and how many SAR (Special Administrative Region) residents have sought help so far? Thank you.

Chief Executive: I thanked Director Xia for personally attending the 5th Anniversary of Promulgation & Implementation of Hong Kong National Security Law Forum in Hong Kong, and taking the opportunity to inspect Hong Kong. I sincerely thanked him for affirming the work of me and the governing team on our proactive approach and determination to forge ahead. He encouraged me and the SAR Government to continue our efforts in safeguarding national security, while balancing well its relation with development. Director Xia also encouraged us to capitalise on the current stable situation to build strong development and to build the economy and improve people's livelihood. He reminded Hong Kong to steadfastly uphold national security and not to forget the harm inflicted on the citizens and the city of Hong Kong by the 2019 ""black-clad"" violence and the attempted ""colour revolution"", and we should remember the pain, even though the wound has healed.

 Director Xia's keynote speech in the Forum has charted the course of Hong Kong's future development. He asked Hong Kong to build high-quality development by fully implementing the holistic approach to national security, leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages in its connectivity with the Mainland and the world, utilising Hong Kong’s strengths in the rule of law and upholding Hong Kong's executive-led system to improve governance of the Hong Kong SAR and promote reform. During his inspection, he expressed strong endorsement of the work of the District Councils, the Care Teams (District Services and Community Care Teams) and the concept of Community Living Rooms. I am grateful to Director Xia for his caring and support for Hong Kong. We will spare no effort in safeguarding national security and co-ordinating security and development. We will focus on four key areas.

First, Hong Kong must fully and accurately implement the ""one country, two systems"" principle and thoroughly adopt a holistic approach to national security.

Second, adhere to the solid foundation of the rule of law and leverage Hong Kong's international strengths, especially the professional advantages in both common law and civil law systems.

Third, cherish the stable situation and seize development opportunities, actively integrate into the national development, deepen international exchanges and co-operation, leverage Hong Kong's advantages of our connectivity with the Mainland and the world, and promote the two-way flow of overseas and Mainland enterprises, capital and technology through ""going global"" and attracting international investments.

Fourth, enhance traditional strengths, focusing on reform and innovation, enhancing the competitiveness in finance, trade, shipping and technology. We will boldly reform, innovate and create. We will accelerate the development of the Northern Metropolis, the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, and we shall make development of industries as our fundamental goal, enhance innovation and technology and drive reforms to speed up and strengthen efficiency.

 On your question regarding the conflicts in the Middle East, the Spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has already stated that China urges parties to the conflict to prevent the situation from spiralling up, make sure the fighting will not spill over, and return to the track of political settlement. China stands ready to enhance communication and co-ordination with various parties to pool efforts together and uphold justice, and play a constructive role for restoring peace in the Middle East. I support the stance of our country and I totally agree. I support ensuring the safety of civilians and resolving issues through diplomatic means. I also call on the international community to jointly safeguard global peace. I hope the situation in the Middle East resumes to peace and stability as soon as possible.

  In view of the latest developments in Israel and Iran, the Government has already raised the Outbound Travel Alert for Israel and Iran to black last week. This signifies a severe threat. Hong Kong residents should avoid all travel to Israel and Iran. They should attend to personal safety, leave or relocate to relatively safe areas immediately. As of June 23, the Immigration Department has received enquiries from 21 Hong Kong residents who were in Israel or Iran. Twenty of them have already departed safely. The Department will continue to maintain close contacts with the remaining one Hong Kong resident and provide appropriate assistance. It is important that Hong Kong residents in these two countries, or in areas where threats may spiral up too to pay close attention to personal safety, leave and relocate to other safer areas, pay attention to the developments through the news, what we, the Government, broadcast, and also the websites of the Security Bureau. We will keep close communication with the Office of the Commissioner of the MFA in Hong Kong, and we will also maintain close communication with relevant embassies. The Security Bureau will closely monitor the situation. Any updates will be issued and announced immediately, and we will also be updating relevant mobile apps as well.

(Please also refer to the Chinese portion of the remarks.)"
行政長官於行政會議前會見傳媒開場發言及答問內容（附短片）,2025-06-24 14:38,2025-06-24 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/24/P2025062400374.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（六月二十四日）上午出席行政會議前會見傳媒的開場發言及答問內容：

大家早晨。相信大家都知道，我在上任後，設立「行政長官表揚榜」，以表揚極度卓越的表現。

我很高興在這裏向大家公布今次的「行政長官表揚榜」由兩個團隊分別獲得，他們是二○二五年三月前赴緬甸地震災區救援的特區救援隊及啟德體育園開幕跨部門籌備專組。

今年三月，緬甸發生7.6級大地震，造成重大傷亡。特區政府迅速組織跨部門救援隊。一隊由保安局、消防處、入境處和醫院管理局成員組成的隊伍，當仁不讓、迅即應召，帶同搜救犬及救援工具，日夜兼程，趕赴緬甸地震重災區展開搜救。

他們在災區進行爭分奪秒的搜救行動，環境惡劣，充滿風險，包括餘震、不穩固的建築物可能倒塌、交通和通訊不斷中斷、連日超過40度高溫、粉塵滿地、蚊患嚴重等。

特區救援隊克服重重困難，在災區的57個地點進行共61次搜救行動，更在與國家救援隊的聯合行動中成功救出一名被困超過125小時的倖存者，攜手實踐國際人道主義精神，亦充分展現特區救援隊的堅韌意志、專業能力和團隊精神。

特區救援隊臨危受命，於國際救援行動中彰顯崇高使命，以行動向世界展示他們的無私勇敢，值得行政長官表揚。

另一個得獎團隊是啟德體育園開幕跨部門籌備專組，由文化體育及旅遊局、保安局、公務員事務局、運輸及物流局、警務處及運輸署成員組成，他們的精密籌劃，通盤部署，專業的大規模測試和演練，確保啟德體育園開幕和運作暢順，尤其妥善保障大型活動的人潮管理、疏散安全有序，觀眾體驗良好，成功確立了啟德體育園作為大型活動的世界級一流場地、一流活動、一流體會的成功典範。

啟德體育園是香港歷來最大型的盛事基建，對本地的體育以至盛事經濟發展，有關鍵性的作用，所以確保運作暢順安全和秩序良好 ，非常重要。

啟德體育園在今年三月開幕。面對時間緊迫、項目規模龐大、協調工作複雜等多重挑戰 ，籌備專組展現卓越的組織能力和專業部署，在短短五個月完成了約20次場地測試，並以創新思維、細緻規劃，統籌跨部門協作演練，動員14萬人次公務員，以及多個地區組織參與演練，全面測試啟德體育園和周邊設施的承載能力，包括系統設備的應用、觀眾進場及離場安排、公共運輸配套、同時管理超過六萬人流的能力和壓力測試等。

籌備小組更聯繫大量涉及不同領域的營運操作者，統一理念和目標，以底線思維，制訂各情景預案，包括突發事件和不穩定天氣的應變計劃等。

啟德體育園於今年三月一日正式開幕，迅即成為國際性體育及休閒娛樂新地標，順利舉行多項世界級國際體育及娛樂盛事，叫好又叫座，已吸引超過60萬名觀眾入場，當中超過五成來自內地和海外，為觀眾帶來美好體會，為香港帶來巨大的經濟收益。活動安排暢順、秩序良好，獲得市民和旅客點讚。跨部門籌備專組的周全工作，功不可沒，值得行政長官表揚。

兩支得獎團隊反映了公務員的卓越能力，亦反映政府效率，印證了今年《世界競爭力年報》給予香港「政府效率」世界第二的排名，使我更相信建立以結果為目標的政府這政策是對的。

我恭賀兩支得獎團隊，為他們的表現和貢獻感到驕傲。頒獎典禮詳情將於稍後公布。多謝大家。

記者：特首，你好。想問關於房委會向「精進建築」收回三個地盤，涉及6 200個公屋單位，預計何時有新承建商接手？有沒有一個時間目標？以及評估工程會延誤多久？如何可以減低對公屋輪候時間的影響？另外，剛才也提到，就以伊衝突升溫，見到卡塔爾領空都一度關閉，特首如何評估現時中東局勢？本港與中東的合作方面會否繼續維持？會否擔心原本有意投資中東的港商會猶豫？如何釋除他們疑慮和協助現時在當地的港商？謝謝。

行政長官：首先，「精進建築」方面，我們採取了措施是因為要確保工程安全。我們依法辦事，也是依規矩辦事。由於這件案件已進入聆訊階段，不適宜談及案件細節。但政府的立場很清晰——要確保工業安全，也要確保工人的生命安全。工人的生命很寶貴，所以政府會做盡一切提升工人安全，亦都要給予工人最佳的安全保障，這方面我們會努力。

至於不同的工程項目，現時來說，如果是與「精進建築」一起合作的話，他們合作的另外工程承建商，我們希望他們會接手處理，有些亦已接手做。我們亦希望任何接手工程的新公司會繼續聘用現時的地盤工人，這方面進展良好。我們亦希望，任何承建商如果參與這些工程，盡量繼續聘用上一手的工人。

由於有不同項目都是由「精進建築」負責，對我們實際房屋供應會有所影響。不過，影響方面，我相信由於工程和單位數目多，特別在未來幾年，都會有很多工程項目，每一個參與單位都會在不同環節提速提效，盡量在多方面加快，希望將影響減到最低。因為我們的項目多，所以相對來說，我相信影響雖然有，但我們都可以承受得到。

另外，中東局勢方面，最近中國外交部發言人已經表示，國家敦促衝突當事方防止局勢輪番升級，堅決避免戰爭外溢，重回政治解決軌道。

我是支持和認同國家的立場，我支持保障平民安全，我支持以外交途徑解決問題，亦呼籲國際社會，特別是有影響力的，共同促進和平地解決這些事端，我的心是很希望中東局勢盡量回復和平、平穩。

我們針對局勢亦都對兩個國家——伊朗和以色列——發出了黑色外遊警示，表示有嚴重威脅，所以呼籲香港市民盡快離開這兩個國家。無論有任何原因，他們都應盡量留意自己的人身安全。

我們會不斷發布這方面的消息，我知道本來有21位香港居民在這兩個國家，已經有20位離開，我們會與餘下一位保持聯絡，亦會與有關大使館和外交部駐港特派員公署保持聯繫。

與中東的合作，我覺得無論世界如何變化，經貿發展都要進行，我們亦更能看到合作的重要性和必要性。無論將來的風如何高、浪如何急，我們都知道要繼續令社會運作、我們的市民生活正常。所以無論中東也好，香港也好，以至其他地方，我相信每個政府都會努力在其他方面確保經濟發展不受影響，還要更加努力。所以，我相信我們與中東的合作只會更深、更快。而香港作為一個非常安全穩定的地方，尤其在「一國兩制」下，大家都會明白在「一國兩制」之下，香港特別有中國保護是很安全，包括資金、投資、其他各方面的財產在香港的安全，這正正會吸引更多資金來港，我們都會將這視為——雖然有危——機遇。

我們與中東的合作已有很好的基礎，自從兩年前我訪問了中東國家後，之間的往來不斷上升。之後，我再前往訪問中東兩個國家，更加看到由第一次到第二次後，很多投資合作都落地、有成果，所簽署的訂單越來越多，所以這方面合作更頻繁。而中東的投資者在香港設立的例如基金、辦事處、商會，都越來越多，而我們看到在中東來發展的公司都開始多，所以這方面的交往合作更多。

另一方面，我們將香港建立成為一個穆斯林友善城市，我們很高興最近在穆斯林友善城市的排名（「全球穆斯林旅遊指數」）是第三，對中東的旅客都很吸引。

所以就這方面，我們覺得不止在投資、合作，還有人文往來，我相信會更頻密。而香港的確定性在哪裏？就是我們的安全、穩定，以及我們是一直保持強國際化的城市。所以既安全又穩定，又可以完全利用國際可能給予的機遇，同時亞洲在未來發展引擎的機遇，我覺得香港在合作、投資方面，只會增加，不會減少。

記者：早晨，特首。首先，近日文體旅局局長受訪時回應，會更加嚴謹審批資助和場地去提防軟對抗，引起藝文界的討論，他們認為這個說法是冤枉了幾多無辜的人和作品，甚至質疑是矯枉過正。政府究竟如何向他們說明，分辨軟對抗和文化創作藝術？第二，星期日在機場，有無人駕駛巴士發生碰撞意外，恰巧本月其實有幾輛無人駕駛的車亦在東涌市開始試行，政府到底會如何跟進？會否公布調查結果？將來如何推進香港的無人駕駛？謝謝。

行政長官：軟對抗肯定在香港存在。夏寶龍主任在《香港國安法》公布實施五周年論壇很清晰說明，反中亂港勢力依然潛伏在香港，軟對抗依然存在，我的發言亦說明軟對抗依然存在。例子是，較早前有人冒認他人身分到中央器官捐贈登記名冊，假扮他人取消登記，製造一個假象——很多人想退出登記，這就是軟對抗，還有兩人已被拘捕，法庭亦定了罪，並要入獄。所以軟對抗是存在的，在不同領域、形形色色都存在。試想想，雖然我們現時因為《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》生效，但不時還有人涉及一些煽動，違反《香港國安法》或《維護國家安全條例》的人被拘捕，還是有人有這一種思想傾向。

夏寶龍主任說了一句，不要「好了傷疤忘了痛」，所以軟對抗存在是真實的，而且潛伏在不同地方，各個領域都有可能，有些還以不同名義，聽起來很像是道貌岸然，但實際是有意圖危害國家安全，又或者做一些破壞性的軟對抗。這些形形色色、林林種種，大家要擦亮眼睛、醒覺。而所有在法律上獲賦予權力的人、機構，在《維護國家安全條例》中說得很清楚，只要在法律方面獲授予權力，使用權力時，就要以維護國家安全為重要考慮。

政府一定會就這方面繼續工作，亦繼續提醒大家，在不同方面小心軟對抗。當然，對政府的批評，或有一些表達方式，如果沒有壞意圖，不是進行破壞，社會是容許的。但是要小心，不要只看單一片段，很多時候如果將一連串的事聯繫，你就知道，這可能是軟對抗的整個計劃的其中一部分，所以大家要擦亮眼睛，小心觀察。夏寶龍主任來到，語重心長，再提醒香港，雖然《香港國安法》實施了五周年，雖然整體香港社會是平穩受控，安全受到保障，但風險依然存在。

維護國家安全的法律對付哪些人？是破壞我們國家安全的人。破壞國家安全的人是如何破壞，他不希望我們國家好、強大起來。那他會否不做？現時你看到國際形勢，他還是在做，他亦曾經安插不同代理人在香港，培育了一班人，是他們的發言人、代言人、代理人等。所以夏寶龍主任語重心長，不要「好了傷疤忘了痛」，我亦再次提醒大家，它可能是潛伏性、可能是隱蔽性，甚至可能是欺騙性。香港人當然是很君子，否則我們不會有這麼多騙案，做了這麼多宣傳，香港人真的是很君子，但小人滿街，我們要特別小心這方面的軟對抗。

至於日前在機場禁區發生的無人駕駛巴士事故，我們重視，我亦看到運輸及物流局局長即時已經要求機場管理局進行深入調查，一定要找出原因，防止再有這些事情發生，所以已經即時停用同類巴士。但在機場禁區試用無人車，已經差不多六至七年，如果以里數計，就已經行駛了230萬公里，今次出現這事情，一定要查出原因。

我覺得科技能處理既安全又方便的問題，但這次出現甚麼事，令我們要更強化某些系統，令它更安全，這是重要的，任何交通工具，亦一定要重視安全，有人駕駛的要重視安全，無人駕駛的更重視安全。這是世界發展的大勢所趨，我相信將來即使不在香港，我們出外，很多地方都會有無人駕駛，所以這個技術將未來會在不同地方出現，香港必然要出現。但我們必然要確保安全，這方面我們努力，我希望這個調查盡快找出原因。而且香港現時正在進行測試的無人駕駛車輛，有很多間公司、很多車種，而且是由運輸署嚴格監督，審視他們實際測試的情況，就這方面，我們的要求很高，市民可以放心，我們的標準是高的。多謝大家。
