DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-29 13:20,2025-08-29 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/29/P2025082900478.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 29) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

市民可透過以下途徑，取得更多資料：衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111）、中暑專頁、紫外線專頁；天文台「打電話問天氣」（1878 200）、最新天氣報告及預報、紫外線指​數、遠足及攀山天氣資訊；及勞工處於工作暑熱警告生效期間，對戶外工作的僱員和其僱主發布有關預防中暑措施的新聞公報。"

Kicking off with the HKGFA's 8th Annual Forum on September 8, the week will spotlight Hong Kong's leadership in green technology, green fintech, and climate innovation, reinforcing its pivotal role in accelerating Asia's low-carbon transition.

 Hong Kong Green Week will highlight Hong Kong's strategic priorities and achievements in sustainability, including its policy roadmap, robust regulatory framework and commitment to international collaboration. The joint efforts of InvestHK and the HKGFA aim to channel capital into high-impact green projects, catalyse new solutions for transition finance, and support capacity building in developing countries and emerging markets.

 The Global Head of Financial Services, FinTech & Sustainability at InvestHK, Mr King Leung, said, ""Hong Kong will further solidify its position as a launch pad for green and sustainable capital during the upcoming Hong Kong Green Week. Supported by a robust financial system meeting international standards, world-class infrastructure, and a globally aligned taxonomy, we channeled capital into transformative green projects across regions and industries. Our collaboration with the HKGFA ignited a powerful wave of cross-sector partnerships, advancing sustainability goals.""

 The Chairman and President of the HKGFA, Dr Ma Jun, added, ""Hong Kong demonstrated its pivotal role in advancing Asia's climate leadership, particularly amid the context of the United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Hong Kong Green Week is set to showcase our capabilities to host regional platforms and dialogues, fostering policy consensus, facilitating innovative cross-border transactions, and driving capacity building in emerging markets.""

 HKGFA Executive Vice President Ms Tracy Wong Harris said, “Transition finance is paving the way for corporates to accelerate decarbonisation while maintaining sustainable growth. Through initiatives like the HKGFA's Transition Planning Knowledge Repository, we are empowering the market with purpose-built tools and insights to develop credible transition strategies aligned with ambitious climate targets. By integrating climate and nature considerations into policy, Hong Kong is further advancing its financial infrastructure and climate risk management system to help the real economy to transition to net-zero.""

 HKGFA Executive Vice President Ms Chaoni Huang said, ""Robust global connectivity and regional collaboration on expanding leading frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) are essential to advancing sustainable finance. As a co-convenor of the TNFD in Hong Kong, the HKGFA is at the forefront of building capacity and fostering crucial dialogue to integrate nature-related risks into financial decision-making. By working alongside our members and partners globally, the HKGFA will continue to enhance the ecosystem's capacity to assess and manage nature-related risks and opportunities, bridging global sustainability standards with regional and local implementation.""

 InvestHK and the HKGFA hosted a media briefing today to share insights into Hong Kong's green and sustainable finance landscape and its central role in accelerating Asia's climate transition. The briefing also provided a preview of the highly anticipated Hong Kong Green Week, with the HKGFA's 8th Annual Forum launching the event. Speakers highlighted the importance of cross-agency coordination, policy innovation, and capacity building, alongside key initiatives. Case studies underscored the city's growing impact in climate-focused investment and regional collaboration.

二○二五年上半年學生患結核病比率有持續下降趨勢,2025-08-29 11:30,2025-08-29 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/29/P2025082900302.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）胸肺服務今日（八月二十九日）公布二○二五年上半年學生患結核病個案的情況。雖然結核病呈報個案持續下跌，但中心提醒市民，特別是學校、學生及家長，應時刻保持個人及環境衞生，預防結核病。

中心在二○二五年一月至六月共接獲1 464宗（臨時數字）結核病呈報個案，比去年同期少151宗（減幅接近一成），亦維持過去數十年以來的下降趨勢。

期內的呈報個案中，有21宗涉及學生，年齡介乎12歲至26歲，佔同期結核病呈報個案1.43%。與去年同期學生的結核病個案比率（1.73%）相比，二○二五年上半年的個案比率持續下降，期內亦沒有發現涉及校園的結核病群組個案。

上述資料已上載至胸肺服務統計數字網頁。

衞生署公共衞生服務處主任戴麗文醫生指出：「盡早發現病例及適時進行抗結核藥物治療是最主要的結核病防控措施。在衞生署的持續宣傳教育和市民的衞生意識加強下，香港的結核病呈報率及死亡率在過去數十年持續顯著下降。然而，結核病在本港仍然相當普遍。衞生署一直致力在學校、社區和醫療界推廣防癆意識，以期結核病個案能及早被發現及診斷，達致有效地控制傳染的源頭。」

戴醫生表示，結核病是一種經空氣傳播的疾病，當結核病人咳嗽或打噴嚏時，所產生含有結核菌的小點便會於空氣中散播。若旁人吸入這些小點，便有可能會受到感染。但一般而言，與病人長時間接觸才是造成傳染的最重要條件。

胸肺服務亦為個案的緊密接觸者進行篩查，並就結核病的預防及處理製作指引供學校參考。如欲了解更多資訊，可參閱有關指引專頁（www.info.gov.hk/tb_chest/tb-chi/contents/Guidelines_School.htm）。

市民必需繼續保持對結核病的警覺性，培養良好生活習慣，包括均衡飲食、戒煙戒酒、並配合適當運動和休息。市民如有長期咳嗽、痰中帶血、消瘦、發燒和午夜盜汗等徵狀，便應及早求醫。若不幸染上結核病，應加強呼吸道衞生和咳嗽禮儀，並在監督下接受治療。

因應學生患結核病的比率近年一直維持在低水平，中心將調整其風險傳達策略，日後會按實際情況需要發放新聞公報，至於與學校有關的結核病的相關統計數字，中心會按一貫做法每半年上載於胸肺服務網頁。市民亦可致電2572 6024，了解更多有關結核病的資料、服務及統計數字。"
Tuberculosis rate among students continues to decline in first half of 2025,2025-08-29 11:30,2025-08-29 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/29/P2025082900304.htm,"  The Tuberculosis and Chest Service (TB&CS) of the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced today (August 29) the number of tuberculosis (TB) cases involving students in the first half of 2025. Although reporting that the number of TB cases continued to decline, the CHP urged the public, especially schools, students and parents, to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times to prevent TB infections.

  From January to June 2025, the CHP received 1 464 notifications of TB cases (a provisional figure), representing a decrease of 151 cases (nearly 10 per cent) compared to the same period last year. This downward trend has been observed over the past few decades.

  Among the reported cases during this period, 21 cases involved students aged from 12 to 26, accounting for 1.43 per cent of all reported TB cases. Compared to the rate of TB diseases among students (1.73 per cent) in the same period last year, the case rate in the first half of 2025 continued to decline. No TB cluster cases involving a school setting were identified during this period.

  The above information has been uploaded to theTB&CS statistics webpage.

  ""Early identification of TB cases and the timely initiation of anti-TB treatment remain the mainstay of TB control. With the ongoing publicity and education efforts of the DH, as well as increased public awareness of hygiene, the notification and death rates of TB in Hong Kong have shown a significant and sustained decline over the past few decades. However, TB remains prevalent in the community. The DH continues to promote awareness of TB and its prevention in schools, the community and the healthcare sector, aiming to identify and diagnose cases early to effectively control the disease at its source,"" the Consultant of Public Health Services Branch of the DH, Dr Tai Lai-bun, said.

  Dr Tai explained that TB is an airborne disease. When a TB patient coughs or sneezes, small droplets containing the tubercle bacilli are generated and spread in the air. If another person breathes in these small airborne droplets, he or she may be infected with the germ. Prolonged exposure, however, is usually the most important condition for the disease to be effectively transmitted.

  The TB&CS also conducts contact investigations for the close contacts of an index case and provides guidelines on TB prevention and management for schools. For more information, please refer to the guidelines available atwww.info.gov.hk/tb_chest/en/contents/Guidelines_School.htm.

  Members of the public should remain vigilant against TB and adopt a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet, avoid smoking and alcohol, get adequate exercise and adequate rest. Those experiencing symptoms such as a persistent cough, blood in sputum, weight loss, fever and night sweating should seek medical advice promptly. Individuals diagnosed with TB should strengthen respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette while receiving TB treatment under medical supervision.

  Given that the TB rate among students has remained at a low level in recent years, the CHP will adjust its risk communication strategy and will issue related press releases based on the actual situation and needs in the future. As for statistics related to TB in schools, the CHP will continue to upload them to the website of the TB&CS every six months. For more TB-related information, services and figures, the public may also call the telephone hotline (2572 6024)."

DH responds to media enquiries about efforts to combat illegal smoking,2025-08-28 21:55,2025-08-28 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800856.htm,"In response to media enquiries about efforts to combat illegal smoking, the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the Department of Health today (August 28) gave the following response:

""Between August 25 and 30, TACO conducts an enforcement operation codenamed ""Laserflame"" to crack down on illegal smoking in statutory no smoking areas (NSAs) of public transport facilities throughout the territory. The operation aims to raise public awareness of relevant smoking ban regulations, including the 10 newly designated NSAs at public transport facilities (PTFs) effective from August 31, while intensifying efforts to combat illegal smoking. All enforcement actions strictly adhered to legal provisions and procedures.

TACO conducts enforcement actions according to the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance and coordinates manpower deployment. Stringent operational guidelines have been established and professional training has been provided to TACO officers. The reference benchmarks set by TACO for planning of enforcement actions aims to provide the teams a reference for manpower deployment and enforcement work priorities. They are not rigid targets of enforcement figures set for frontline officers. TACO emphasises that frontline officers take enforcement action only when they actually observe violations, but not rigidly pursuing a specified target.

TACO calls on the public to observe the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance and work together to maintain a smoke-free environment in PTFs. NSAs are marked with designated signs and layout plans, with clearly delineated demarcation lines according to the actual environment to remind citizens to comply with smoking bans. Any person who does a smoking act in NSAs or in public transport carriers will be liable for a fixed penalty of $1,500. Tobacco and Alcohol Control Inspectors will prosecute smoking offenders without prior warning.

As of 5pm today, officers from TACO conducted 203 inspections at PTFs and issued 39 FPNs for smoking offences during the ""Laserflame"" operation.

In addition to its law enforcement work, TACO actively promotes smoke-free environments through preventive smoking education and cessation services, including community outreach to raise public awareness of smoking's hazards.

For the sake of the health of individuals, their families and others, the Government appeals to smokers to quit smoking as early as possible. Members of the public may call the DH's Integrated Smoking Cessation Hotline on 1833 183, which is operated by registered nurses to provide professional counselling services on smoking cessation."""
衞生署回應傳媒有關打擊違例吸煙行為的查詢,2025-08-28 21:37,2025-08-28 21:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800834.htm,"就傳媒查詢有關打擊違例吸煙行為，衞生署控煙酒辦公室（控煙酒辦）今日（八月二十八日）作以下回應：

控煙酒辦於八月二十五日至八月三十日在全港公共運輸設施法定禁煙區採取代號名為「雷火」的執法行動，旨在向公眾宣傳相關禁煙法規（包括將於八月三十一日起新增的十個公共運輸設施法定禁煙區），同時加強打擊違例吸煙行為，所有執法行動均嚴格依照法律規定和程序。

控煙酒辦一向按照《吸煙(公眾衞生)條例》執法及作人手調配，並為員工制定嚴格工作指引和提供專業培訓。控煙酒辦為執法工作規劃設下參考基準，旨在讓各小組安排人手調配及執法工作優次時有所參考，並非就檢控數字為前線人員設硬性指標。控煙酒辦強調前線人員只會在發現實際違法情況下執法，並不是要硬性追趕達致某個指標。

控煙酒辦呼籲公眾遵守《吸煙(公眾衞生)條例》，共同維護公共運輸設施無煙環境。禁煙區設置禁煙標記及禁煙區的圖則，並按其實際環境以界線清晰顯示禁煙區的範圍，提醒市民遵守禁煙規定。任何人在指定為禁止吸煙區或公共交通工具內作出吸煙行為，可被處定額罰款1,500元。控煙酒督察會即時票控違例吸煙人士而不予事先警告。

截至今日下午五時，控煙酒辦人員在相關執法行動中，在公共運輸設施進行了203次巡查，並就有關違例吸煙行為發出了39張定額罰款通知書。

除了執法工作，控煙酒辦亦一直透過宣傳預防吸煙和戒煙服務，包括在社區進行無煙宣傳教育提高公眾對吸煙禍害的認識等，積極推廣無煙環境。

為個人、家人及他人健康着想，政府呼籲吸煙人士盡快戒煙。市民可致電衞生署綜合戒煙熱線1833 183。熱線由註冊護士接聽，為吸煙人士提供專業戒煙輔導。"
Hong Kong Environmental Database earns another recognition (with photos),2025-08-28 21:35,2025-08-28 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800803.htm,"  The Hong Kong Environmental Database (HKED) (hked.epd.gov.hk), developed by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has once again been honored with awards, winning the ""Best Smart Environment Award"" and the ""Grand Award"" at the Hong Kong/Shanghai Co-operation Open Data Challenge (HSODC) 2025 yesterday (August 27), reaffirming the remarkable progress made by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government in applying innovative technologies to optimise the environmental impact assessment (EIA) processes.

  HSOSC 2025, jointly steered by the HKSAR Government's Digital Policy Office (DPO) and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Data, adopted the theme ""Co-creating a Data Industry Platform for the Two Cities"". It encouraged participants to leverage open data resources from both Hong Kong and Shanghai to develop innovative solutions in four key areas: Smart Mobility, Smart Living, Smart Environment, and Smart Economy, thereby fostering deeper integration and synergy in the digital economies of the two cities. Following the first round of judging, 13 teams from Hong Kong advanced to the final judging held in Shanghai on August 26. They competed with local teams for the top-four finalists and the Grand Award.

  Conducting his visit to Hangzhou and Shanghai from August 24 to 28, the Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui, led representatives from the EPD to attend the award ceremony held in Shanghai yesterday to receive the awards.

  The HKSAR Government has taken a number of measures to optimise the EIA process, including the establishment of the HKED in 2022. The EPD has consolidated around 300 EIA reports handled since 1998. Through meticulous verification, data organisation, and format conversion, more than 200 high-value environmental data layers have been created, providing a robust foundation for local EIA studies. The HKED has also been benefitted from the HKSAR Government's Common Spatial Data Infrastructure portal, which allows the integration of over 20 environment-related core decision-making layers. Supported by smart assessment tools, the HKED enables more efficient data analysis and audit, thereby enhancing the accuracy and credibility of EIA reports.

  Since its launch, the HKED has won several awards. Following the Best Environmental Innovation Award received at the Southeast Asia Forum International Conference last December, the HKED was also honoured with theInternational Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA) 2025 ""Corporate Initiative Award"" in March this year.

  On his visit to Hangzhou and Shanghai, Dr Chui inspected the Artificial Intelligence ecological monitoring program in the Xixi National Wetland Park and visited the talent training base at the Huawei Global Training Center during the first stop in Hangzhou.

  On August 25, Dr Chui proceeded to visit Shanghai, where he held discussions with the Level I Bureau Rank Official of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Ecology and Environment, Mr Bai Guoqiang, on co-operation between Hong Kong and Shanghai in environmental protection. Dr Chui also exchanged views on technical solutions for sewage and waste treatment with the Director of Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design Institute, Mr Zheng Zhimin, and visited the Laogang Ecological and Environmental Protection Base. In addition, Dr Chui met and exchanged views with the Director of Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Shanghai, Mrs Laura Aron."
Fresh beef sample found to contain sulphur dioxide,2025-08-28 20:18,2025-08-28 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800793.htm,"âThe Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (August 28) that a fresh beef sample was found to contain sulphur dioxide, a preservative which is not permitted to be used in fresh meat. The CFS is following up on the incident.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS, under its routine Food Surveillance Programme, took the fresh beef sample from a fresh provision shop (FPS) on Gage Street, Central, for testing. The test result showed that the sample contained sulphur dioxide at a level of 91 parts per million. The CFS is following up with the FPS concerned about the irregularity.""

According to the Preservatives in Food Regulation (Cap. 132BD) (the Regulation), it is an offence to add sulphur dioxide to fresh or chilled meat. The maximum penalty is a $50,000 fine and six months' imprisonment.

Sulphur dioxide is a preservative which can be used in a variety of foods including dried vegetables, dried fruits, pickled vegetables and salted fish products, but under the Regulation it is not permitted in fresh or chilled meat. Individual meat traders have been found illegally using sulphur dioxide to make meat look fresher. Sulphur dioxide is water-soluble, and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However, susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties, headaches and nausea after consumption.

The spokesman reminded the food trade to comply with the law and not to sell fresh or chilled meat adulterated with sulphur dioxide. Members of the public should purchase meat from reliable market stalls or FPSs. They should avoid buying or consuming meat which is unnaturally red, and maintain a balanced diet to avoid malnutrition or excessive exposure to chemicals from a small range of food items.

The CFS will continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing."
新鮮牛肉樣本含二氧化硫,2025-08-28 20:18,2025-08-28 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800791.htm,"​食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（八月二十八日）公布，中心在一個新鮮牛肉樣本檢出不可在新鮮肉類中使用的防腐劑二氧化硫，正跟進事件。

中心發言人說：「中心透過恆常食物監測計劃，從中環結志街一新鮮糧食店檢取該新鮮牛肉樣本進行化驗。結果顯示，樣本含百萬分之九十一的二氧化硫。中心正與涉事新鮮糧食店跟進有關違規事項。」

根據《食物內防腐劑規例》（第132BD章）（《規例》），在新鮮及冰鮮肉類中添加二氧化硫屬違法，最高可判罰款五萬元及監禁六個月。

二氧化硫是一種防腐劑，可用於乾菜、乾果、醃菜和鹽醃的魚製品等不同種類的食物，但根據《規例》不得用於新鮮或冰鮮肉類。個別販商為使肉類色澤更鮮明，會違法在肉類中添加二氧化硫。二氧化硫可溶於水中，清洗和烹煮可除去食物中大部分二氧化硫。不過，對二氧化硫有過敏反應的人，在食用後可能會出現氣喘、頭痛或噁心等徵狀。

發言人提醒業界必須遵守法例規定，不可售賣摻雜二氧化硫的新鮮及冰鮮肉類。市民則應向可靠的街市檔戶或新鮮糧食店購買肉類，切勿購買或進食顏色異常鮮紅的肉類，同時需注意均衡飲食，因為偏食可引致營養不良或攝取過多的化學物。

中心會繼續跟進事件和採取適當行動。調查仍然繼續。"

Admission is free. The exhibition shows the history of the people of Guangdong and Hong Kong, led by the Chinese Communist Party, and how they were closely united in resisting the enemy.

Addressing the opening ceremony today (August 28), the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, said that Guangdong and Hong Kong have shared the same roots and blood connections since ancient times. During the War of Resistance, the people of the two places fought side by side, crafting a moving chapter of patriotism. Hong Kong did not only function as a vital transit hub for wartime supplies from abroad, but also hosted the Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column, which conducted operations behind enemy lines, making significant contributions to the country. He also said that remembering history, honoring martyrs, cherishing peace, creating a great future, understanding the spirit of the War of Resistance, and better nurturing and inspiring the patriotic sentiment of the public are among the essential aims of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government in promoting patriotic education.

Other officiating guests today included the Secretary General of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Wang Songmiao; the Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Cultural Relics cum Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Culture, Radio, Television and Tourism Bureau, Mr Liu Xiaoming; the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law; the Curator of the Guangdong Museum of Revolutionary History, Mr Yi Xibing; Legislative Council Member and the Chief Editor of the Hong Kong Chronicles Institute, Professor Lau Chi-pang; the Permanent Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Ms Vivian Sum; member of the Working Group on Patriotic Education under the Constitution and Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee, Ms Melissa Kaye Pang; the Chairman of the History Sub-committee of the Museum Advisory Committee, Professor Joshua Mok; the President of the Society of Veterans of the Original Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column, Ms Lam Chun; and the Director of Leisure and Cultural Services, Ms Manda Chan.

The exhibition comprises three parts, namely ""The Fall of Guangdong and Hong Kong"", ""The Fierce Resistance"", and ""The Victory in the War of Resistance"", featuring some 40 items/sets of wartime relics. Important exhibits include a silver ring awarded to meritorious personnel of the Zhongshan People's Anti-Japanese Volunteer Battalion in November 1944; the book ""Understanding the Total War of Resistance"" by writer Guo Moruo, one of Guangzhou's representative anti-war cultural works; a cloth chest badge and binoculars used by the Dongjiang Column; a telegraph announcing Tsang Sang as Commander and Wang Zuoyao as Deputy Commander of the Dongjiang Column; and a commemorative badge for the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column. The exhibition also displays around 150 historical photos on the huge suffering of the people in Guangdong and Hong Kong under the aggression of Japanese militarism, their united resistance and eventual great victory in the War of Resistance. The exhibition presents the historical mission of unity of the people of Guangdong and Hong Kong in resisting the enemy, and commemorates martyrs and compatriots who sacrificed their lives in defending the country.

The MWRCD has set up a dedicated War of Resistance book corner with a book selection for visitors to acquire an in-depth understanding of the War of Resistance. There are also creative interactive games integrating education with entertainment for members of the public, especially youngsters, to actively learn from history, thereby fostering patriotism, promoting and passing on the values of patriotic education.

The MWRCD will launch a series of free activities.

醫務衞生局局長談「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」（只有中文）,2025-08-28 19:39,2025-08-28 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800684.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（八月二十八日）視察北京大學深圳醫院及南方醫科大學深圳醫院首日推行「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」的運作安排後會見傳媒的談話內容：

醫務衞生局局長：大家好！我很高興今日到深圳見證「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」正式落戶在前海的南方醫科大學深圳醫院。南方醫科大學深圳醫院是前海一間最大規模的三級甲等綜合醫院，亦是一間集醫、教、研的醫院。前海作為深港的服務合作區，肩負着「依託香港、服務內地、面向世界」，對為跨境的香港居民提供生活和就業便利非常重要。今日除了南方醫科大學深圳醫院外，我們同時亦開展了北京大學深圳醫院，以及肇慶市第一人民醫院亦開啟了試點計劃。來到今日，行政長官在二○二三年提出「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」已經達致大灣區九個城市全覆蓋的目標。「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」是粵港醫療合作中一個很重要的里程碑，也是大灣區醫療融合和制度創新的一個非常重要的政策。

香港的長者醫療券是特區政府給予65歲以上長者的醫療福利，每年有最多2,500元港幣，可以自主在私營醫療服務上使用，特別是做基層醫療的檢查和治療。在二○二四／二五年度，長者醫療券的開支達到33.2億元，而今年的預算將超過42億元。我們很高興地回顧長者醫療券能跨境過河到深圳，剛好今年就是十年了。十年的長者醫療券跨境過河到廣東省異地結算，可以分做兩個階段，第一個是二○一五年，即整整十年前，香港大學深圳醫院第一次開展長者醫療券的試點計劃，而第二階段是二○二三年行政長官提出「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」，在短短兩年間，醫療券在大灣區進入快速車道，兩年內除了已經做到大灣區九個內地城市全覆蓋外，我們有很多突破，包括醫療券已經可以用在一些非港資的內地三甲醫院、可以用在民營醫院、可以用在一些牙科的專業醫療機構，甚至中醫院都能夠使用醫療券，讓市民有更多選擇。更重要的一點是，長者醫療券的使用，我們打通了跨境病歷互通，通過醫健通的系統，香港的長者可以帶着他香港的病歷跨境，亦有一個資料夾把一些內地的病歷資料帶回香港，令醫療質量安全更有保障。

「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」能夠開通，我們很感謝廣東省衞健委（廣東省衞生健康委員會）的大力支持和指導，亦要多謝九個城市所有衞生健康的部門，我更要多謝各個醫療機構，他們有多個服務點，所有這些醫療機構都用了很大努力去配合整個醫療券政策的落地，包括他們的電腦系統、整個預約、流程、人手的配置，以至一些很細微的地方，我們今日都可以看到，是真真正正很用心去做，給我們市民一個很暖心的服務，安心地在大灣區使用醫療服務，一個優質的醫療服務。

香港特區政府會繼續做好跨境醫療融合和創新，我們在很多政策上都強調「優勢互補、互利共贏」，希望在其他跨境醫療的合作上，可以為大灣區的居民提供更好的服務，亦在建設「健康灣區」的同時，積極助力我們國家的「健康中國」的戰略。多謝大家。

記者：現在新增兩間醫療機構，然後對未來深港合作方面……

醫務衞生局局長：今天我們是增加了三家，是深圳的北大深圳醫院（北京大學深圳醫院），還有南方醫科大學深圳醫院，另外是肇慶的第一人民醫院（肇慶市第一人民醫院）。這不單只是三個醫療機構加入到試點計劃，更重要一點，是大灣區九個內地的城市都有醫療機構可以使用醫療券。我覺得這對國家的大灣區整個政策是很有重要的意義，特別在醫療方面，我們希望令居民可以有更好的幸福感和安全感。醫療服務對居民不單只是生活，養老確實是非常重要的，現在香港有不少居民都會選擇到大灣區內地的城市養老，因為內地很多在養老的條件可能比香港要好。有估算香港可能有超過50萬市民常居在大灣區的內地城市，那麼「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」就可以讓他們在大灣區九個內地城市，不論在哪裡都有一個城市比較方便，讓他們不用跑回香港去使用醫療券，讓他們更安心地在大灣區養老。

記者：除了大灣區外，何時可以擴展到更多城市？

醫務衞生局局長：我們在擴展醫療券使用的時候，都是考慮循序漸進，所以我們由原本的港大深圳醫院（香港大學深圳醫院）「一院兩點」，第一步在二○二三年行政長官宣布，之後我們在二四年，即去年的六月，開始了七間醫療機構，都是圍繞珠江三角洲的核心區域，由中山到廣州、東莞，以至深圳。今年我們把它擴大，做到九個城市全覆蓋，包括惠州、紹興、珠海、以至江門、佛山都有。我們覺得香港居民始終在大灣區的數量是比較多，特別養老的長者比較多，我們會密切地監察和評估計劃的成效，確保醫療券能夠幫到市民。但另一方面我們會積極考慮通過大灣區試點計劃的評估後，有沒有一些地方也有這樣的需要，在考慮的時候，我們主要會考慮香港居民養老的地方在哪裏，舉例福建可能會是一個考慮點，因為香港有「福建計劃」，讓香港的長者到福建養老，我們要在評估大灣區的試點計劃之後，再做下一步的決定。謝謝。"

They visited various historical sites and museums in Shenzhen, Dongguan and Guangzhou, with a focus on patriotic devotion to the Chinese nation, gaining a deeper understanding of the gallant efforts of the war martyrs.

  The delegation visited the Dongjiang Column Memorial Hall at Pingshan, Shenzhen, and the former headquarters of the Dongjiang Column in Tuyang Village, Shenzhen, yesterday to learn more about the heroic deeds of the Dongjiang Column of the Guangdong People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force under arduous conditions during the War of Resistance.

  The delegation toured the Guangdong Memorial Hall of East River Column in Dongguan, the former site of the Dalingshan Anti-Japanese Base, and the Dajing Revolutionary Martyr Monument in Houjie, today. Dongguan was a key base of operations for the Dongjiang Column, with Dalingshan serving as a major stronghold during the resistance and holding significant historical value. In the afternoon, the delegation proceeded to the Dongjiang Column Spirit Square and Huafeng Monastry in Guangzhou to explore the surrounding Red cultural resources, gaining insights of wartime efforts and the spirit of national salvation.

  Dr Lee remarked that this year marks the 80th Anniversary of the Victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. Guided by the core spirit of ""remembering history, honouring martyrs, cherishing peace, and creating a great future"", the WGPE has been motivating different community groups and the public to join diverse commemorative activities, thus helping the patriotic spirit take root in Hong Kong. She said she hopes that different sectors can enhance their awareness of the War of Resistance on the Mainland and in Hong Kong, strengthen their patriotic sentiments, and work together to cherish and safeguard peace. This will help cultivate patriotic feelings and foster a strong sense of national identity and belonging."
食環署主動巡查　多管齊下打擊冷氣機滴水問題（附圖）,2025-08-28 19:32,2025-08-28 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800630.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（八月二十八日）表示，為應對夏季冷氣機滴水問題對市民造成的滋擾，已於今年採取全新行動策略，積極主動地處理全港多個冷氣機滴水地點。

食環署指出，處理冷氣機滴水問題面對多項挑戰，包括市民不為意自己單位出現冷氣機滴水；全港冷氣機數量龐大及在夏季使用頻率高，令投訴量激增；大廈缺乏中央排水系統及冷氣機喉管接駁不當，增加出現滴水情況；滴水多在清晨或晚間發生；以及滴水源頭位於高層或被遮擋的位置令調查難度增加等。

為提升工作成效，食環署今年採取全新行動策略，除繼續處理市民投訴外，食環署人員會主動出擊，以「洗樓」形式重點跟進各區約300個冷氣機滴水地點，亦鎖定30個對市民造成較大滋擾的黑點，包括巴士站、小巴站等，高密度派員加強巡查。

食環署積極應用創新科技，署方與創新科技署轄下的物流及供應鏈多元技術研發中心合作研發的冷氣機滴水調查系統，今年在各區應用的成效顯著。該系統配備紅外線夜視錄像功能，有助在低光環境下識別滴水源頭，解決以往調查上的困難，大幅縮減調查取證時間，無需進入住戶單位亦可完成初步判斷。此外，署方已加強調配人手於清晨或晚間進行特別行動，由以往安排七成人手於日間調查、三成人手於夜間調查，改變為三成人手於日間調查和七成人手於夜間調查。

食環署亦與各界協作進行宣傳教育，包括在全港各區聯同地區人士和區議員共同派發宣傳單張和舉辦宣傳活動，並且透過電台及社交媒體廣泛宣傳正確保養冷氣機的資訊。同時，署方推行的物業管理公司協助處理冷氣機滴水事故計劃亦取得進展，該計劃邀請私人屋苑的物業管理公司協助調查冷氣機滴水投訴，目前已有二百八十多個私人屋苑參與，平均每年處理逾四千宗個案。食環署正與物業管理業監管局合作，鼓勵更多物業管理公司參與計劃。

截至八月二十四日的統計數據顯示，食環署今年累計已處理約5 200部冷氣機的滴水問題，較去年同期增加百分之二十五，較二○二三年同期更大幅上升三倍。在30個影響市民排隊候車的滴水黑點（涉及14區、逾160座大廈及約七千部冷氣機），食環署已處理約一千部冷氣機的滴水問題，令環境衞生顯著改善。

食環署會持續以多管齊下的方式處理冷氣機滴水問題，亦呼籲各界攜手合作，其中物業管理公司應定期維修及保養大廈排水系統，並提醒住戶進行檢查維修；而市民亦應定期檢查其冷氣機，並在出現滴水情況時立即處理，以避免造成滋擾。"
FEHD steps up enforcement and multipronged efforts to combat issue of dripping air conditioners (with photos),2025-08-28 19:32,2025-08-28 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800632.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (August 28) that, in response to the nuisance caused by dripping air conditioners in summer, it has adopted a new enforcement approach this year to proactively tackle multiple dripping air conditioner locations across Hong Kong.

The FEHD pointed out that tackling the issue of dripping air conditioners currently faces multiple challenges. These include public unawareness of dripping air conditioners on their premises, the vast number of air conditioners across Hong Kong, a surge in complaints due to frequent usage in summer, which mostly occurs in the early morning or evening, the lack of communal drainage pipes in some buildings and improper connection of air conditioner pipes, which increases the likelihood of dripping, and the technical difficulties in tracing the source of dripping, which often originates from upper floors or is obscured from view.

To enhance efficiency, the FEHD adopted a new operational strategy this year. In addition to sustaining the effort in handling dripping air conditioner complaints as usual, FEHD officers proactively conducted ""door-to-door"" inspections and took enforcement action at about 300 key follow-up locations across districts. Furthermore, 30 dripping blackspots causing significant nuisance to the public, including bus stops and minibus stops, were targeted for intensified patrols.

By leveraging innovative technology, the FEHD and the Logistics and Supply Chain MultiTech R&D Centre (LSCM) under the Innovation and Technology Commission have jointly developed the Dripping Air Conditioner Investigation System, which has achieved remarkable results while being used in all districts. Equipped with infrared night-vision recording, the system helps identify the source of dripping in low-light conditions. It resolved previous difficulties in investigations, significantly shortened the time required for investigation and evidence collection, and enabled preliminary assessments to be made without entering the premises. Furthermore, it enabled effective deployment of manpower for special operations in the early morning or evening, changing the previous allocation of 70 per cent of manpower for daytime investigations and 30 per cent for nighttime investigations to 30 per cent for daytime investigations and 70 per cent for nighttime investigations.

In collaboration with various sectors to carry out publicity and education, the FEHD distributed leaflets and souvenirs and held publicity events in various districts of Hong Kong with members of the local community, including District Councillors. The FEHD also promoted knowledge of proper air conditioner maintenance through radio and social media. In parallel, the FEHD's Scheme of Participation by Property Management Agents in Tackling Dripping Air-conditioners, which invites property management agents of private housing estates to assist in investigating dripping air conditioner complaints, has also made progress, with over 280 private housing estates participating and handling an average of over 4 000 cases annually. The FEHD is collaborating with the Property Management Services Authority to encourage more property management companies to join the scheme.

As of August 24, the FEHD has handled approximately 5 200 dripping air conditioners, marking a 25 per cent increase over the same period last year and a threefold surge compared to the same period in 2023. Among the 30 dripping blackspots (involving 14 districts, over 160 buildings, and approximately 7 000 air conditioners) that seriously impacted public queuing for transport, the FEHD has handled cases involving approximately 1 000 air conditioners and significantly improved environmental hygiene.

The FEHD will continue to adopt a multipronged approach to address the dripping problem of air conditioners and calls on all sectors to work together. Among them, property management companies should repair and maintain building drainage systems regularly, remind residents to check and repair their air conditioners, and citizens should also check their air conditioners regularly and take immediate action if water drips to prevent causing nuisance."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-08-28 19:30,2025-08-28 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800633.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月二十八日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據世界衞生組織的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。今年全球多國爆發基孔肯雅熱，截至今年七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗個案，當中約90宗為死亡個案。夏季溫度及雨量處於高水平，令多種蚊傳疾病在香港，以至全球爆發的風險持續，市民不能掉以輕心。由於新學年即將開始，中心呼籲學校按照食物環境衞生署（食環署）的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，務必提醒教職員及學生，應時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。」

本港今年累計錄得12宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

食環署繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

​為加強長者對預防蚊傳疾病的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊已透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解相關疾病的預防及提供外遊健康建議。此外，外展分隊亦已提醒全港所有安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關蚊傳疾病的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成10種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，無論在本地或是外遊期間都必須時刻採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施。若出現相關病徵，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後，應立即求醫，並通知醫生相關旅遊史。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-08-28 19:30,2025-08-28 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800634.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 28), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

""According to the World Health Organization, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks this year, and as of July this year, over 240 000 cases had been reported in 16 countries/regions worldwide. Of these cases, about 90 were fatal. High temperatures and rainfall levels in summer continue to pose a risk of outbreaks of various mosquito-borne diseases in Hong Kong and around the world, and members of the public must remain vigilant. As the new school year is about to begin, the CHP urged schools to follow the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)'s anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. They should also remind the staff members and students to enact mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases on campus,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui said.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 12 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The FEHD continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

â
âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising them on mosquito-borne disease prevention and tips on travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. Moreover, the Visiting Health Teams have also reminded all residential care homes for the elderly in Hong Kong to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of mosquito-borne diseases.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite (www.chp.gov.hk/en/static/104022.html).

Dr Tsui reminded members of the public that they must take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have a travel history. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

ââ
âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

尊敬的王松苗秘書長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室秘書長）、劉曉明局長（廣州市文物局局長兼廣州市文化廣電旅遊局副局長）、梁君彥主席（立法會主席）、羅淑佩局長（文化體育及旅遊局局長）、易西兵館長（廣東革命歷史博物館館長）、劉智鵬教授（香港地方志中心總編輯）、莫家豪教授（博物館諮詢委員會歷史專責委員會主席）、彭韻僖女士（憲法和基本法推廣督導委員會愛國主義教育工作小組委員）、林珍女士（原東江縱隊港九獨立大隊老游擊戰士聯誼會會長）、各位蒞臨現場的抗戰老戰士、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！我非常高興今日出席香港抗戰及海防博物館「風雨同舟 共建和平——粵港人民抗戰勝利八十周年展」的開幕典禮。

今天，我們相聚一堂，共同紀念中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利八十周年。首先，我謹代表特區政府，向所有為抗戰勝利作出貢獻的先烈及老戰士致以最崇高的敬意。

正如習近平主席所說：「歷史是最好的教科書，也是最好的清醒劑。中國人民對戰爭帶來的苦難有着刻骨銘心的記憶，對和平有着孜孜不倦的追求。」特區政府一直重視紀念抗戰歷史，並於去年九月三日的「中國人民抗日戰爭勝利紀念日」這個具有歷史意義的日子設立香港抗戰及海防博物館。自設立以來，博物館推出一系列與抗戰相關的展覽、公眾及教育活動，讓公眾對抗戰歷史有更深入的認識。在過去一年，博物館的參觀人次超過16萬，包括來自400多間學校近3萬名學生。適逢今年是中國人民抗戰勝利八十周年，博物館和廣東革命歷史博物館共同舉辦「風雨同舟 共建和平——粵港人民抗戰勝利八十周年展」，以紀念粵港兩地人民團結和奮勇抗敵的歷史，同時緬懷捨身護國的抗日英烈及遇難同胞，共建和平社會。

亙古以來，粵港兩地同根同源、血脈相連。抗戰期間，兩地人民並肩作戰，共同譜寫了可歌可泣的愛國篇章。中國共產黨領導華南人民抗日游擊隊積極開展敵後抗日游擊戰爭，創建敵後抗日根據地；組織規模宏大的粵港秘密大營救，產生廣泛的國際影響，在華南抗戰中發揮中流砥柱作用。此外，香港不僅是海外抗戰物資的重要轉運站，更有東江縱隊港九獨立大隊進行敵後活動，為國家作出重要貢獻。

抗戰時期，中國作為世界反法西斯戰爭的東方主戰場，對全球反法西斯戰爭的勝利具有巨大的歷史意義。在紀念中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利75周年座談會中，習主席說：「中國人民在抗日戰爭的壯闊進程中孕育出偉大抗戰精神，向世界展示了天下興亡、匹夫有責的愛國情懷，視死如歸、寧死不屈的民族氣節，不畏強暴、血戰到底的英雄氣概，百折不撓、堅忍不拔的必勝信念。」這次展覽不僅展示中國人民的英勇抗戰，也展示了國家在世界反法西斯戰爭中的貢獻。展覽透過約40件（套）珍貴的歷史文物和約150幀歷史照片，包括東江縱隊成員曾使用的物品，及記錄廣州和香港淪陷和抗戰先烈的照片等，讓香港市民更深刻了解這段歷史，感受中國共產黨的偉大領導和全國人民的團結奮鬥精神，讓年輕一代銘記這段共同抗戰歷史，珍惜來之不易的和平，及展現對歷史的尊重、對英烈的尊崇。銘記歷史，緬懷先烈，珍愛和平，開創未來，感悟抗戰精神，更好厚植和激發廣大市民的愛國情懷，正是特區政府推動「愛國主義教育」其中一個重要目的。

在此，我要特別感謝廣州市文化廣電旅遊局、廣州市文物局及廣東革命歷史博物館的人員對這次展覽的大力支持，並提供豐富的歷史材料和寶貴意見，使這次展覽得以順利舉辦，有力地在香港抗戰及海防博物館這個愛國主義教育重要基地，共同推動中華文化與抗戰歷史的傳承。

最後，我祝展覽圓滿成功！謝謝大家！"

Among the ninth batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering eight survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering nine survey areas in August, all were below 10 per cent, except the Area Gravidtrap Indexes for Kai Tak North in Kowloon City District and Ma Wan in Tsuen Wan District.

For Kai Tak North in Kowloon City District and Ma Wan in Tsuen Wan District, which recorded an index over 10 per cent, in accordance with the mechanism implemented by the FEHD in response to the recent chikungunya fever (CF) situation (i.e. strengthening mosquito control work in areas with a gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, instead of 20 per cent or above under the original mechanism), the FEHD is collaborating with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with high mosquito infestations and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. In particular, the gravidtrap data for Kai Tak North indicated that areas with more mosquito problems included public housing estates, and the Area Gravidtrap Index for Kai Tak North survey area dropped from 15.9 per cent in July to 12.3 per cent in August. The gravidtrap data for Ma Wan indicated that areas with more mosquito problems include parks, and the gravidtrap index for Ma Wan survey area dropped from 30.4 per cent, which was the highest in the first phase of July, to 14 per cent in August. The relevant departments and stakeholders are actively following up on the mosquito control work. The FEHD will also organise exhibitions, distribute leaflets and posters, and notify the residential estates that have subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures. In addition, the FEHD will strengthen the monitoring of the gravidtrap indexes in those two areas to review the effectiveness of the mosquito control work.

The FEHD has so far released nine batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August 2025, covering 59 survey areas. Among these 59 survey areas, 38 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. July 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Fifteen other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


âStarting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of CF transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department’s webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

八月份第九批涵蓋八個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及九個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，除了九龍城區啟德北及荃灣區馬灣的分區誘蚊器指數，其餘都在10%以下。

針對指數高於10%的包括九龍城區啟德北及荃灣區馬灣，按因應基孔肯雅熱情況而實施的安排（即將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域），食環署正聯同有關部門及持份者攜手，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。其中，啟德北誘蚊器的數據顯示蚊患較多的地方包括公共屋邨，該監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數由七月份的15.9%下跌至八月份的12.3%，馬灣誘蚊器的數據顯示蚊患較多的地方包括公園，該監察地區的誘蚊器指數由七月份第一階段錄得最高的30.4%下跌至八月份的14%，各相關部門及持份者正積極跟進控蚊工作。食環署亦會舉辦宣傳展覽、派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。此外，食環署會加強監察該兩個地區的誘蚊器指數，以檢視滅蚊工作成效。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年八月共九批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共59個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年七月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這59個監察區中，有38個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有15區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

 The discussion of the first thematic session of the meeting focused on expanding the energy mix. Mr Tse said in the meeting that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been stabilising energy prices and supply by measures such as regulating the electricity market, increasing the use of clean energy and strengthening regional co-operation. Related to these measures, Hong Kong's first offshore liquefied natural gas receiving terminal commenced operation in 2023, which enables Hong Kong to procure natural gas at more competitive prices. Mr Tse stated that Hong Kong will continue to strengthen regional co-operation and explore ways to import more zero-carbon energy in line with the city's sustainable development.

 In the second thematic session on strengthening grid resilience, Mr Tse said that to cope with increasing impacts brought by inclement weather caused by climate change, Hong Kong's power companies have been adopting advanced technologies, such as AI-driven monitoring systems of critical power facilities and forecasting models on flooding projections to strengthen the grid's resilience. He also shared the progress of fully covering Hong Kong with the Smart Metering System and how users can achieve energy conservation and convenient maintenance using the system.

 In the afternoon, Mr Tse attended the third thematic session and shared Hong Kong's experiences in using AI technologies. He cited the example of the AI agent Engentica, launched this year in the building electrical and mechanical industry, which can optimise and adjust chillers through live weather data, automatically diagnose faults, and predict maintenance needs, thereby enhancing the operational efficiency and reliability of infrastructures. Mr Tse expressed his hope to continue collaborating with APEC member economies on AI projects to jointly drive AI development.

 During the EMM today, Mr Tse met with the Administrator of the National Energy Administration, Mr Wang Hongzhi, to discuss ways to strengthen regional co-operation and share the HKSAR's progress towards achieving the targets of net-zero electricity generation and carbon neutrality. Mr Tse also had bilateral meetings with representatives from Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia to exchange views on energy issues.

 Mr Tse will meet with representatives of an energy company and visit a hydrogen energy facility tomorrow (August 29) to learn about the latest developments in hydrogen technology in Korea."

Professor Lo also took the opportunity to engage with Hong Kong elderly persons attending the clinics and was pleased to learn that they welcomed the Pilot Scheme and applauded the smooth provision of services. The elderly persons expressed gratitude to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for implementing the scheme and considered that the expansion to 21 service points in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) has greatly enhanced convenience, providing them with more medical treatment options and sparing them the burden of lengthy journeys.

Professor Lo said, ""Following the service launch of the three pilot medical institutions today, the goal of extending the Pilot Scheme to nine Mainland cities in the GBA as announced in 'The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address' has been fully achieved. The nine cities are fully covered under the Pilot Scheme. In just two years, the number of service points for using Elderly Health Care Vouchers (EHCVs) in the GBA has expanded from the two service points operated by the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital to tenfold with a total of 21 service points (see Annex). Additionally, the coverage has expanded from being applicable only in Shenzhen to full coverage of nine Mainland cities in the GBA. The Pilot Scheme marks a significant milestone for policy innovation and healthcare collaboration between the two places, fully demonstrating the Guangdong and Hong Kong governments' commitment and dedication to cross-boundary medical collaboration.

  ""I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude once again to the Health Commission of Guangdong Province and the health authorities of various cities for their strong support and assistance with the Pilot Scheme, benefitting more than 1.78 million eligible Hong Kong elderly persons. At the same time, I extend my sincere appreciation to the 19 pilot medical institutions under the Pilot Scheme for their wholehearted commitment and meticulous arrangements in providing high-quality healthcare services to Hong Kong elderly persons.""

He emphasised, ""The HKSAR Government will stay committed to fulfilling the important role of safeguarding the well-being of Hong Kong citizens by continuing to provide them with quality healthcare services and will not shift the responsibility of taking care of Hong Kong citizens' well-being to the Mainland healthcare system. The Pilot Scheme aims to offer elderly persons greater choices in using their EHCVs according to their individual circumstances. We will continue to assess and monitor the operation and usage of EHCVs in the pilot medical institutions and review the effectiveness of the Pilot Scheme in due course. Under the principle of complementarity and mutual benefits, we will continue to promote healthcare collaboration in different cities of the country to jointly build a 'Healthy Bay Area' and advance the strategy of 'Healthy China'.""

PKUSZH is a modern comprehensive Tier III Class A public hospital, which is invested in and established by the Shenzhen Municipal Government and assigned to integrate medical services, scientific research and teaching.

盧寵茂教授亦趁機會與到診的香港長者交流，欣悉他們十分歡迎「試點計劃」，並讚揚服務順暢。他們感謝香港特別行政區（特區）政府推行有關計劃，又認為大灣區內新增服務點至21個，大大增加便利性，讓他們有更多就醫選擇和省卻舟車勞動。

盧寵茂教授說：「隨着三間試點醫療機構今日開展服務，《行政長官2024年施政報告》中宣布擴展『試點計劃』至大灣區九個內地城市的目標圓滿達成。『試點計劃』實現九市全覆蓋。短短兩年，醫療券在大灣區的服務點從香港大學深圳醫院的一院兩點，以十倍的增長擴展至共21個服務點（附件）；同時亦由只適用於深圳市擴展至大灣區九個內地城市全覆蓋。『試點計劃』為政策創新及兩地醫療合作立下重要里程碑，亦充分體現粵港兩地政府對跨境醫療協作的努力和承擔。」

「我再次衷心感謝廣東省衞生健康委員會和各市衞生部門對『試點計劃』的大力支持和協助，讓超過178萬名合資格香港長者受惠。同時，我亦衷心感謝『試點計劃』下19間試點醫療機構的全情投入及細緻安排，為香港長者提供優質的醫療服務。」

他強調︰「特區政府會一如既往地擔當保障市民健康的重要角色，持續在香港提供優質的醫療服務，不會將照顧市民健康的責任轉移至內地醫療系統，而『試點計劃』目的是為長者在使用醫療券時可按自己的情況，有更多選擇。我們會持續評估及監測醫療券在試點醫療機構的運作和使用情況以及適時檢討『試點計劃』的成效。我們會繼續以優勢互補、互利共贏的原則與國家不同城市推展醫療合作，共同建設『健康灣區』、助力『健康中國』的戰略。」

北大深圳醫院是深圳市政府投資建成集醫療、科研、教學為一體的現代化三級甲等綜合性公立醫院，同時為廣東省高水平醫院，以及「港澳藥械通」的指定醫療機構。

南醫大深圳醫院是深圳市政府與南方醫科大學攜手打造的市屬三級甲等綜合性公立醫院，亦是前海自貿區內唯一一家同時承擔醫療、教學與科研任務的大學直屬附屬醫院，以及「港澳藥械通」的指定醫療機構。

"Three other new drugs approved under ""1+"" mechanism for benefits of good drugs",2025-08-28 17:15,2025-08-28 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800559.htm,"âA Government spokesman announced today (August 28) that three more new drugs submitted for registration under the new drug approval mechanism (""1+"" mechanism) have been approved for registration in Hong Kong. These three new drugs are respectively used to treat patients with thyroid eye disease, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer and severe hemophilia A or B, bringing more treatment options for patients and facilitating the availability of more good drugs for use in Hong Kong.

Three new drugs approved

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has implemented the ""1+"" mechanism since November 1, 2023, to facilitate the registration of new drugs used for the treatment of life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases in Hong Kong. With effect from November 1 last year, the ""1+"" mechanism has been extended to all new drugs, including all new chemical or biological entities and new indications, and vaccines and advanced therapy products. New drugs that are supported by local clinical data and recognised by local experts can be applied for registration in Hong Kong by submitting approval from one reference drug regulatory authority (instead of two in the past).

The above three products have been approved by the drug regulatory authority in the United States and submitted for registration applications under the ""1+"" mechanism. Having evaluated the clinical data and relevant information submitted by the applicant and advice given by local experts, the Registration Committee under the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Hong Kong considered that the new drugs satisfied the criteria of safety, efficacy and quality, and approved the registration of the new drugs. The Department of Health (DH) has already notified the applicants of the results of the applications.

Paving the way towards ""primary evaluation""

Since the implementation of the ""1+"" mechanism, a total of 14 new drugs, including the above three drugs, have been approved under this mechanism. Five of them have been listed in the Hospital Authority Drug Formulary. The DH has been promoting the ""1+"" mechanism through different channels and so far has received more than 620 enquiries from over 160 pharmaceutical companies, including those from overseas and the Mainland. Many companies have expressed interest in submitting applications for registration of their products, including advanced therapy products, under the extended ""1+"" mechanism. Since the launch of the consultation service for new drugs applications under the ""1+""mechanism in March this year, the DH has already held a number of briefing seminars and workshops. The DH will also have pre-new drug application meetings with potential ""1+"" registration applicants, starting from the fourth quarter of this year, to enhance the efficiency in processing relevant applications.

The ""1+"" mechanism serves to attract more new drugs from different parts of the world seeking approval for registration in Hong Kong, giving patients more choices and further strengthening the local capacity for drug evaluation while enhancing the development of relevant software, hardware and expertise with a view to progressing towards ""primary evaluation"", i.e. to directly approve applications for registration of drugs and medical devices based on clinical data in Hong Kong, without relying on other drug regulatory authorities.

The Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation will be established by the end of next year, and the DH will implement ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration in phases beginning next year, with full implementation by 2030. The DH will continue to proactively advance preparatory work for ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration and progressively establish a robust approval system for medical products, providing strong momentum for the development of healthcare in the HKSAR, the Mainland, and beyond, thereby transforming Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub."
「慢病共治計劃」實施診症共付額年度調整及擴展服務對象,2025-08-28 17:15,2025-08-28 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800547.htm,"醫務衞生局今日（八月二十八日）公布，參與「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」）的家庭醫生每年按既定機制調整的篩查及治療階段診症共付額，將由下星期一（九月一日）起生效。此外，「慢病共治計劃」會分階段擴展服務對象，讓目前在醫院管理局（醫管局）普通科門診覆診而情況合適的病人，以及將於二○二八年結束的普通科門診公私營協作計劃（門診協作計劃）參加者參與。

「慢病共治計劃」採用共付模式，除政府資助外，參加者亦須負擔一定的共付額，以鼓勵市民成為自己健康的第一責任人。家庭醫生可自行釐定篩查階段的診症共付額（不多於120元）和治療階段的診症共付額，並可按既定機制每年調整一次。

就治療階段而言，九月一日調整共付額後與現時比較，仍然維持約有六成半服務點收取政府建議的150元或以下的診症共付額（617個服務點），共付額的中位數亦繼續維持在150元。現時參與計劃的971個服務點中，有874個（即90%）的共付額維持不變，有八個服務點的共付額會下調（下調幅度由30至150元不等，中位數為75元），而餘下的89個服務點的共付額會上調（上調幅度由20至300元不等，中位數為50元）。整體而言，治療階段診症共付額於來年的上調幅度為3.1%。至於篩查階段的診症共付額，有一個服務點會由政府建議的120元下調至100元。更新後的篩查及治療階段診症共付額列表已載於計劃專題網站供市民參考，而專題網站家庭醫生搜尋器所顯示的相關資料亦會在九月一日更新。

另外，為配合政府的基層醫療發展方向，醫務衞生局會分別由下月和明年年初開始，陸續以專函邀請合適的普通科門診病人，和現時門診協作計劃的參加者參加「慢病共治計劃」。所有選擇參加「慢病共治計劃」的病人，其共付額及服務安排與其他「慢病共治計劃」參加者一致。

醫管局於二○一四年推出門診協作計劃，資助長期在普通科門診覆診的病人在社區接受私營基層醫療服務。門診協作計劃只提供醫生診症及相關服務，目前有接近五萬名參加者，主要為糖尿病和高血壓患者，病人須繳付門診共付額。

 「慢病共治計劃」的服務較門診協作計劃更為全面，例如涵蓋跨專業服務（包括專屬護士診所、視光師、足部治療師、物理治療師和營養師）、有地區康健中心協調和提供其他健康管理課程等配套安排，以及設有達標獎勵等，未來亦會覆蓋更多慢性疾病。

門診協作計劃預計於二○二八年結束，計劃辦事處會與參與計劃的醫生保持溝通，及與病人個別跟進他們的後續選擇和安排。

「慢病共治計劃」自推出以來反應良好，至今已有超過15萬名市民參加計劃。截至今年八月二十日（臨時數字），超過九萬人已完成了篩查，其中約四成被診斷為血糖偏高、或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂，有三萬六千人已進入治療階段。政府會持續推廣「慢病共治計劃」，鼓勵市民積極預防及管理慢性疾病，從而提升全民健康。

再多三款新藥在「1+」機制下獲批  體現「好藥港用」,2025-08-28 17:15,2025-08-28 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800556.htm,"​政府發言人今日（八月二十八日）表示，再有三款新藥在「1+」藥物審批機制下獲批准在港註冊。該三款藥物分別用於治療甲狀腺眼病、復發或轉移性子宮頸癌，以及嚴重甲型或乙型血友病，能為病患者帶來更多醫治選擇，進一步體現「好藥港用」。

三款獲批新藥

香港特別行政區（特區）於二○二三年十一月一日起實施「1+」機制，便利用以治療嚴重或罕見疾病的新藥來港註冊，並已於去年十一月一日起將「1+」機制擴展至所有新藥，包括任何含新藥劑或生物元素成分的製品及藥物新適應症、疫苗以至先進療法製品。新藥若能提供符合要求的本地臨床數據，並經本地專家認可後，只須提交一個（而非原來的兩個）參考藥物監管機構，便可以在香港申請註冊。

上述三款新藥均已獲美國的藥物監管機構批核，並在「1+」機制下提交註冊申請。香港藥劑業及毒藥管理局轄下的註冊委員會在對申請人提交的臨床數據及相關資料作出審評及經徵詢本地專家的意見後，認為該些新藥符合相關安全、效能及素質標準，批准在香港註冊。衞生署已通知申請人有關審批結果。

有序邁向「第一層審批」

自「1+」機制生效以來，連同上述三款新藥，現時共有14款新藥按此機制獲批准註冊，其中五款新藥已獲納入醫院管理局藥物名冊。衞生署一直積極透過不同渠道宣傳「1+」機制，至今已收到160多間藥廠超個620個查詢，當中包括海外及內地藥廠。不少公司已表示有興趣在擴展的「1+」機制下為包括先進療法製品的藥物提交註冊申請。衞生署亦已推出「1+」新藥註冊申請前會面諮詢服務，於今年三月起先後舉辦多場簡介講座及新藥註冊工作坊，並計劃在今年第四季推出申請前諮詢會議，以提升處理相關申請的效率。

「1+」機制有助吸引更多來自世界各地的新藥來港註冊，讓病人有更多選擇，並強化本地的藥物審核能力和促進相關軟硬件和人才發展，有序邁向「第一層審批」，即可不依賴其他藥物監管機構，而直接根據臨床數據在本港審批藥物。

「香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心」將於明年年底成立，並由明年起分階段推行「第一層審批」新藥註冊機制，至二○三○年全面推行。衞生署會繼續積極推進「第一層審批」新藥註冊機制的準備工作，並逐步建立完善的藥械審批制度，為香港特區以至國家及其他地區的醫療健康發展注入強大動力，將香港打造為國際醫療創新樞紐。"
Chronic Disease Co-care Pilot Scheme to implement annual consultation co-payment adjustments and expand service targets,2025-08-28 17:15,2025-08-28 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800552.htm,"  The Health Bureau announced today (August 28) that the annually adjusted consultation co-payment fees for screening and treatment phases of the Chronic Disease Co-care Pilot Scheme (CDCC Pilot Scheme), as allowed to be set by participating family doctors according to the established mechanism, will take effect from next Monday (September 1). In addition, the CDCC Pilot Scheme will expand its service clientele in phases to cover suitable patients currently attending the General Out-patient Clinics (GOPCs) of the Hospital Authority (HA), and participants of the General Outpatient Clinic Public-Private Partnership (GOPC PPP) Programme which is scheduled to conclude in 2028.

  Under the co-payment model of the CDCC Pilot Scheme, the Government provides a partial subsidy, while participants are required to pay a certain amount of co-payment fee, with a view to encouraging citizens to bear the primary responsibility for their own health. Family doctors are allowed to determine the consultation co-payment fees for the screening phase (not more than $120) and the treatment phase on their own, and have the fees adjusted once annually according to the established mechanism.

  Comparing the current situation with that after the co-payment adjustment for the treatment phase on September 1, the service points charging the Government-recommended consultation co-payment fees at $150 or below remain at approximately 65 per cent (617 service points), while the median co-payment remains at $150. Among the current 971 participating service points, 874 of them (i.e. 90 per cent) will keep their existing co-payment fees unchanged. Eight service points will reduce the co-payment fees (reductions ranging from $30 to $150 and the median is $75), while the remaining 89 service points will increase their co-payment fees (increases ranging from $20 to $300 and the median is $50). Overall, the rate of increase of the consultation co-payment fees for treatment phase is 3.1 per cent in the coming year. Regarding the co-payment fees for the screening phase, there will be one service point reducing the fee from the Government-recommended $120 to $100. The updated list of consultation co-payment fees for screening and treatment phases has been uploaded to the dedicated website of the Scheme for public reference. Relevant information on the webpage for searching family doctors will also be updated on September 1.

  Moreover, to dovetail with the Government's direction of primary healthcare development, the Health Bureau will invite suitable GOPC patients and existing GOPC PPP Programme participants by post, starting next month and early next year respectively, to join the CDCC Pilot Scheme. The co-payment fees and service arrangements for all patients opting to join the CDCC Pilot Scheme will be the same as other CDCC Pilot Scheme participants.

  The HA launched the GOPC PPP Programme in 2014 to subsidise patients being followed up in GOPCs to receive private primary healthcare services in the community. The GOPC PPP Programme only provides doctor consultations and related services, with currently around 50 000 participants who are mainly diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HT) patients. They are required to pay co-payment fees for the outpatient services.

  The CDCC Pilot Scheme provides a more comprehensive range of services to citizens as compared with the GOPC PPP Programme, for example, covering multidisciplinary services (including dedicated nurse clinics, optometrists, podiatrists, physiotherapists and dietitians), service co-ordination and other health management courses arranged by the District Health Centres, as well as the incentive mechanism. More chronic diseases will also be covered in the future.

  While the GOPC PPP Programme is expected to end in 2028, the programme office will maintain communication with the participating doctors and will follow up with the patients individually on their future choices and related arrangements.

  The CDCC Pilot Scheme has been well received by members of the public since its launch, with over 150 000 citizens joining the scheme to date. As at August 20 this year (provisional figures), over 90 000 participants have completed screenings, of which around 40 per cent have been diagnosed with prediabetes, DM, HT or hyperlipidaemia, while 36 000 of them have entered the treatment phase. The Government will continue to promote the CDCC Pilot Scheme to encourage citizens to prevent and manage chronic diseases proactively, thereby enhancing the overall health of the general public.

  For more details of the CDCC Pilot Scheme, members of the public may visit its dedicated website (www.primaryhealthcare.gov.hk/cdcc/en) or call the hotline at 2157 0500. Dedicated staff of the hotline will answer calls from 9am to 9pm from Mondays to Saturdays."
Large-scale interdepartmental counter-terrorism exercise BRAVELIGHT smoothly concludes (with photos/video),2025-08-28 17:05,2025-08-28 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800328.htm," The Inter-departmental Counter Terrorism Unit (ICTU) conducted a large-scale interdepartmental counter-terrorism (CT) exercise codenamed BRAVELIGHT at the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal today (August 28). The exercise simulated a scenario in which terrorists attempted to launch an attack upon arriving in Hong Kong via a cruise ship, staging a knife attack and shooting in the terminal lobby. Their accomplices subsequently took a passenger ship hostage, leading to a gunfight with the Police onboard.

 The Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre was activated during the exercise, overseen by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee; the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki; and the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung.

 Mr Lee said, “The global terrorism situation remains complex. As an international city, Hong Kong continues to enjoy overall safety and stability, but the threats posed by international and homegrown terrorism must not be neglected. Different policy bureaux and departments(B/Ds) of the HKSAR Government must strengthen their co-ordination and response capabilities to address various forms of terrorist attacks.

 “During this large-scale CT exercise, each department performed its respective duties, fully demonstrating its professional competence in responding to terrorist incidents. The relevant departments will consolidate the experience gained to further strengthen the overall CT work of the HKSAR Government.”

 About 500 personnel participated in the exercise. In addition to the Security Bureau and the six ICTU member departments, namely the Hong Kong Police Force, the Immigration Department, the Customs and Excise Department, the Correctional Services Department, the Fire Services Department and the Government Flying Service, staff from the Marine Department, the Government Laboratory, the Hospital Authority and the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal also actively participated and assisted in co-ordinating the exercise.

 The ICTU attaches great importance to public engagement. For the first time, the exercise was broadcast live on television and online, enabling members of the public to observe in real time and further enhance their CT awareness. Nearly 200 volunteers from various community and youth organisations across different sectors and age groups were invited to participate in the exercise. Participants took on different roles in the exercise, gaining firsthand experience in applying the “Run, Hide, Report” emergency response advisory to protect themselves and others in critical situations.

 To strengthen CT preparedness, the CE's 2024 Policy Address announced the establishment of the Three-tier Prevention Framework, comprising the Chief Executive Counter-terrorism Steering Group (CESG) at the first tier (top tier), which steers and formulates CT policies and directions; the Secretary for Security Counter-terrorism Co-ordinating Group at the second tier, which co-ordinates B/Ds' co-operation on CT matters; and seven interdepartmental working groups at the third tier, which follow up on specific studies and carry out CT work. Mr Lee directed at the first CESG meeting that relevant B/Ds should conduct a large-scale interdepartmental CT exercise to further enhance the HKSAR Government's CT preparedness and response capabilities. The HKSAR Government will also organise different types of CT exercise from time to time, based on risk assessments and various factors.

 Under the co-ordination of the Three-tier Prevention Framework, relevant B/Ds will continue to strengthen their CT preparedness in various areas, including enhancing intelligence exchange, expanding community intelligence networks, preventing radicalisation, enhancing public education and organising diverse CT exercises to foster collaboration between departments and private/public stakeholders, as well as bolster the overall defence capabilities of Hong Kong."

 Under the co-ordination of the Three-tier Prevention Framework, relevant B/Ds will continue to strengthen their CT preparedness in various areas, including enhancing intelligence exchange, expanding community intelligence networks, preventing radicalisation, enhancing public education and organising diverse CT exercises to foster collaboration between departments and private/public stakeholders, as well as bolster the overall defence capabilities of Hong Kong."
Large-scale interdepartmental counter-terrorism exercise BRAVELIGHT smoothly concludes (with photos),2025-08-28 17:05,2025-08-28 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800328.htm," The Inter-departmental Counter Terrorism Unit (ICTU) conducted a large-scale interdepartmental counter-terrorism (CT) exercise codenamed BRAVELIGHT at the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal today (August 28). The exercise simulated a scenario in which terrorists attempted to launch an attack upon arriving in Hong Kong via a cruise ship, staging a knife attack and shooting in the terminal lobby. Their accomplices subsequently took a passenger ship hostage, leading to a gunfight with the Police onboard.

 The Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre was activated during the exercise, overseen by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee; the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki; and the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung.

 Mr Lee said, “The global terrorism situation remains complex. As an international city, Hong Kong continues to enjoy overall safety and stability, but the threats posed by international and homegrown terrorism must not be neglected. Different policy bureaux and departments(B/Ds) of the HKSAR Government must strengthen their co-ordination and response capabilities to address various forms of terrorist attacks.

 “During this large-scale CT exercise, each department performed its respective duties, fully demonstrating its professional competence in responding to terrorist incidents. The relevant departments will consolidate the experience gained to further strengthen the overall CT work of the HKSAR Government.”

 About 500 personnel participated in the exercise. In addition to the Security Bureau and the six ICTU member departments, namely the Hong Kong Police Force, the Immigration Department, the Customs and Excise Department, the Correctional Services Department, the Fire Services Department and the Government Flying Service, staff from the Marine Department, the Government Laboratory, the Hospital Authority and the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal also actively participated and assisted in co-ordinating the exercise.

 The ICTU attaches great importance to public engagement. For the first time, the exercise was broadcast live on television and online, enabling members of the public to observe in real time and further enhance their CT awareness. Nearly 200 volunteers from various community and youth organisations across different sectors and age groups were invited to participate in the exercise. Participants took on different roles in the exercise, gaining firsthand experience in applying the “Run, Hide, Report” emergency response advisory to protect themselves and others in critical situations.

 To strengthen CT preparedness, the CE's 2024 Policy Address announced the establishment of the Three-tier Prevention Framework, comprising the Chief Executive Counter-terrorism Steering Group (CESG) at the first tier (top tier), which steers and formulates CT policies and directions; the Secretary for Security Counter-terrorism Co-ordinating Group at the second tier, which co-ordinates B/Ds' co-operation on CT matters; and seven interdepartmental working groups at the third tier, which follow up on specific studies and carry out CT work. Mr Lee directed at the first CESG meeting that relevant B/Ds should conduct a large-scale interdepartmental CT exercise to further enhance the HKSAR Government's CT preparedness and response capabilities. The HKSAR Government will also organise different types of CT exercise from time to time, based on risk assessments and various factors.

大型跨部門反恐演習「勇光」順利完成（附圖）,2025-08-28 17:05,2025-08-28 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800324.htm,"跨部門反恐專責組（反恐專責組）今日（八月二十八日）於啟德郵輪碼頭舉行代號為「勇光」的大型跨部門反恐演習。演習模擬恐怖分子企圖乘搭郵輪到香港發動襲擊，於郵輪碼頭大堂展開刀襲及槍擊，其同黨隨後挾持一艘客船，並與警方於船上爆發槍戰。

政府緊急事故監察及支援中心在演習期間啟動，行政長官李家超、政務司司長陳國基及保安局局長鄧炳強在中心督導。

李家超表示：「全球恐怖主義形勢錯綜複雜，香港作為國際城市，雖然整體安全穩定，但國際恐襲及本土恐怖主義的威脅不容忽視。特區政府各政策局和部門必須加強對不同形式恐怖襲擊的協調與應對能力。」

「各部門在這次大型反恐演習中各司其職，充分展現了應對恐襲事件時的專業能力，並將總結經驗，以進一步強化特區政府整體反恐工作。」

是次演習合共有約500名人員參與。除了保安局和反恐專責組的六個成員部門—即警務處、入境事務處、香港海關、懲教署、消防處及政府飛行服務隊外，海事處、政府化驗所、醫院管理局，以及啟德郵輪碼頭的人員亦積極參與及協助籌備演習。

反恐專責組亦非常重視公眾參與演習的元素，首次安排電視及網上直播，讓市民收看現場實況，提升反恐意識。另外，演習邀請接近200名來自多個不同界別和年齡層的社區和青少年團體義務參與。參與者在演習中扮演不同角色，親身體驗如何在緊急情況下應用「閃、避、求」應變指引，以保障自身和他人的安全。

為加強反恐準備，《行政長官2024年施政報告》提出設立三層防範機制，包括第一層（最高層）的行政長官反恐督導組，指導及制定反恐方針和策略；第二層的保安局局長反恐統籌組，協調各政策局和部門在反恐事宜上的合作；以及第三層的七個跨部門工作小組，跟進具體研究和執行反恐工作。李家超在行政長官反恐督導組首次會議上，指示各相關政策局和部門舉行大型跨部門反恐演練，進一步提升特區政府的反恐準備及應變能力。特區政府亦會因應風險評估及多方面因素，不時舉行各類型的反恐演習。

在「三層防範機制」的推動下，相關決策局和部門將持續多方面加強反恐準備，包括強化情報交流、擴展社區情報網絡、防範自我激化、深化公眾教育，以及舉辦更多元化的反恐演習，促進部門及公私營機構間的協作，全面提升香港的防禦能力。"

尊敬的各位嘉賓：

大家上午好。感謝廣東省法學會與廣州市法學會邀請我參與本次粵港澳大灣區法治論壇。論壇聚焦灣區的改革和法治，展開制度型開放新探索，對推動大灣區規則銜接與制度型開放具有重大意義。

立足「一國、兩制、三法域」，香港發揮普通法制度優勢，積極探索與灣區城市法治協同，服務制度型開放。以下我會圍繞論壇的主題，從四方面分享香港的實踐與思考：

第一，法律科技與區域法治建設。科技和人工智能迅速發展，為制度銜接帶來新機遇。律政司積極推動法律科技應用，參與本地大學科研團隊開發的第一個大語言模型的版本「港文通」，並支持市場開發更多適用的法律人工智能工具。

其中，律政司更推動香港的一邦國際網上仲調中心，與大灣區內不同的仲調機構共同構建大灣區線上爭議解決協作平台，加強灣區居民民商互動，推動灣區法治建設。

這些探索不但提升效能，更為大灣區規則銜接提供技術支持，以科技促進三地法律體系的兼容互補，推動區域法治融通與制度型開放。

第二，金融法治創新，堅實開放基礎。法治是金融創新的基石。香港持續完善金融法律框架，今年八月生效的《穩定幣條例》建立亞洲首個法律框架，涵蓋發牌、儲備管理及投資者保障機制，確保穩定幣市場穩健發展，展現鞏固國際金融中心的決心。我們將深化金融跨境合作，支持內地企業利用香港國際化融資平台拓展業務。

第三，香港國際一流的仲裁體系，服務制度型開放。香港是全球第二受歡迎的仲裁地，香港國際仲裁中心的仲裁規則同樣全球排名第二，去年受理案件數量和爭議總額再創新高。這得益於《紐約公約》的執行力和香港與內地各項的互助安排，進一步強化香港在兩地商業爭議仲裁的競爭力。

隨着國際調解院總部落戶，香港將與區內仲調機構加強合作，推動落實灣區標準，貢獻香港經驗。

第四，兩地企業重組合作機制深化規則銜接。當企業出現債務危機時，高效的重組不但維護企業價值，保護員工崗位，更提升債權人信心，優化投資環境。

二○二一年五月，香港與最高人民法院建立合作機制，容許香港清盤人就債務重組，可以在上海、廈門或深圳的法院申請認可和協助。內地破產管理人也可根據普通法尋求香港承認內地破產或重整程序。這機制提升兩地專業處理跨境重組的競爭力，並為跨法域規則銜接提供可複製的經驗。

大灣區法治建設需要創新思維與務實合作。香港樂於為共建世界級灣區貢獻「香港方案」。最後，預祝論壇圓滿成功，謝謝。"

  Thank you, Chair and fellow colleagues. AI is the key driver to overhaul our energy systems. AI will help us optimise energy production, distribution and consumption, ultimately leading to more resilient and adaptive energy systems. To this end, Hong Kong, China is proactively applying I&T (innovation and technology) and putting efforts and resources into advancing the development of AI. Taking this opportunity, I would like to share with you some examples of AI applications in the energy sector in Hong Kong, China.

 This year, we have launched Engentica, the first AI agent in the Building E&M (electrical and mechanical) industry that redefines intelligent infrastructure management. Leveraging Semantic AI and large language models, Engentica revolutionises facility management by providing real-time chiller optimisation and adjustments based on live weather data, automated fault diagnosis, and predictive maintenance, etc, contributing to enhanced operational efficiency and reliability of infrastructures.

 In addition, one of our power companies has introduced an advanced AI management system to monitor the company's critical power facilities. With the help of AI, the management system integrates and monitors real-time signals from about 3 000 sensors and cameras across the power company's electricity networks in the city, alerting engineering personnel to respond to incidents immediately when potential risks are detected.

 Last year, Hong Kong, China also showcased two innovative AI applications at the Knowledge Sharing Platform for the APEC Energy Smart Communities Initiative: the ChillStream - an AI-based Chiller Plant Optimisation System, and Power-hawk Inspector - a drone-based inspection system using AI to identify power grid defects. We are delighted that the two initiatives were recognised by fellow APEC member economies, receiving three awards at the ESCI (Energy Smart Communities Initiative) Best Practices Awards Program.

 With cutting-edge research, robust infrastructure and a diverse talent pool, Hong Kong, China provides an ideal platform for promoting AI solutions across the region. We look forward to collaborating and partnering with APEC economies on AI projects to leverage our shared expertise and resources to drive AI development."

å¾è¡åé¨é· (Director-General of the Economic Affairs Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Xu Weigang), Mary (Chairperson of the Hong Kong Association of Banks, Ms Mary Huen), å­«ç¸½ (Chairman of the Chinese Banking Association of Hong Kong, Mr Sun Yu), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is a great pleasure to speak to you, today, at this luncheon. I know most of you have already had a full and rewarding morning, and are no doubt looking forward to a fortifying lunch. With that in mind, I will keep my remarks brief and focused.

I understand that Eddie (Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Mr Eddie Yue) shared his perspectives on fintech regulation this morning, including the progress of a number of regulatory initiatives. Allow me to take a step back, outlining the Government's overarching vision for advancing financial innovation in Hong Kong.

Pro-innovation approach

First, the Hong Kong SAR Government is pro-innovation and pro-tech.

We all recognise that technologies are disrupting and reshaping the landscape of finance. From blockchain to artificial intelligence, these innovations allow financial transactions and settlements to be delivered faster, cheaper and more transparently. Yet, as with all transformative technologies, they also come with risks, presenting challenges to investor protection, cybersecurity, even financial security. Around the world, governments and financial regulators face the same fundamental question: to what extent, and at what pace, should we embrace innovative technologies?

For Hong Kong, the answer is clear. As a leading international financial centre, embracing new technologies is not an option. It is a necessity. To stay ahead of the curve, we must be proactive.

Our regulators play a facilitating role in driving financial innovation. A good example is the ""regulatory sandboxes"" implemented by our financial regulators. They allow innovators to test new technologies in a controlled setting, receiving timely regulatory feedback and refining their solutions before wider adoption. Through sandboxes, regulators and innovators collaborate, even working together to create new solutions.

Consider Project Ensemble. It enables industry participants to work with regulators, exploring tokenised asset use, assessing interoperability across platforms and helping define common industry standards. And it involves not only local parties but also overseas partners for cross-border use cases. As technologies evolve, so too must our platforms for experimentation. Over the past year, for example, the HKMA has introduced a sandbox for generative AI applications, as well as an incubator for distributed ledger technology.

These initiatives send a clear message to the market: that we welcome disruptive innovation, while ensuring that risks are identified and managed responsibly. This enables their adoption at scale, and with confidence.

Regulators and market enablers

That brings me to my second point: the role of our financial regulators.

In Hong Kong, regulators are entrusted with a dual mandate. They are not only supervisors who ensure regulatory compliance, but also enablers helping to shape the future of finance. This dual role is a defining feature of our regulatory philosophy.

Take the SFC (Securities and Futures Commission) for example. More than a regulator, it has been instrumental in driving a series of reforms to our stock market - going back to 2018. In fintech, the SFC is the regulator of digital-asset trading platforms. But it also works to expand digital-asset products for trading and listing.

As for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which leads Project Ensemble, it has issued two batches of tokenised green bonds worth HK$6.8 billion over the past two years, making Hong Kong one of the first governments in the world to issue such bonds. I'm pleased to note that preparations for a third batch are already under way.

Together, the Government and regulators lead by example, demonstrating Hong Kong's commitment to driving innovation in the financial sector.

Playing to our strengths

The third point I wish to emphasise is the importance of playing to our strengths.

Hong Kong is Asia's leading international financial centre. We are home to 70 of the world's top 100 banks and six of its top 10 insurers. And they are supported by a dynamic network of asset managers and professional service providers. Our regulatory standards align with the highest international benchmarks, and we contribute to global standard setting via international bodies such as the IOSCO (International Organization of Securities Commissions).

This combination of global connectivity, deep liquidity and world-class expertise makes Hong Kong an ideal environment for fintech development. For start-ups and innovators, launching here is effectively an international seal of approval: if a solution works in our sophisticated, well-regulated, globally connected market, it is far more likely to succeed elsewhere.

And it all comes together thanks to our ""one country, two systems"" framework, enabling Hong Kong to provide unparalleled connectivity between the Chinese Mainland and the rest of the world. That singular advantage also allows Hong Kong to be a natural testing ground for new technologies looking to expand into this region.

The ""Connect Schemes"" perfectly illustrate innovative cross-border financial collaboration. Starting with equities and now including bonds, ETFs and derivatives, they allow international investors to participate in Mainland markets, and Mainland investors to access global opportunities, through a closed-loop system - an innovation only Hong Kong can deliver.

And I believe there is plenty of room for Hong Kong to serve as a two-way platform for fintech solutions as well.

On digital assets

Let me now turn to digital assets, where Hong Kong has emerged as a pioneer.

Over the past few years, we have been building regulatory regimes that encourage tech innovation with suitable guardrails. From the two policy statements on digital assets released over the past couple of years, to the enactment of the Stablecoin Ordinance, and our recent consultation on over-the-counter dealing and custodian service, our trajectory has been clear and consistent. 

A few points are worth reiterating. First, we follow the ""same activity, same risk, same regulation"" principle, ensuring a transparent, fair and risk-based regime that adapts to innovation while protecting investors, consumers and financial security.

Second, we believe digital assets should serve the real economy. This is evident in the regulation of stablecoins, where licences will be granted only to applicants who can demonstrate real-world use cases with a convincing and sustainable business model. 

Third, building a vibrant ecosystem. Over the years, we have put in a holistic and forward looking strategy for digital assets. It goes well beyond regulation to broadening product offerings, modernising infrastructure, advancing cross-boundary use and nurturing talent - all aimed at enabling the sustainable and responsible development of our digital-asset sector.

Looking ahead

Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to share two more points about fintech development down the road.

First, artificial intelligence. When combined with blockchain and other emerging technologies, AI holds immense potential to transform financial services. Streamlining compliance, enhancing customer service, improving credit scoring and risk management are just a few examples of AI's promise. We believe there is substantial potential for AI to go further, to make financial services more efficient, inclusive and accessible.

A survey conducted by the HKMA's Academy of Finance last year revealed that 75 per cent of Hong Kong's financial institutions are already using or planning to use generative AI in their operations. This is a compelling indicator of how quickly the technology is being adopted here.

The Government has prioritised AI as a core industry under a broader ""AI+"" strategy, which seeks to embed AI across every sector of the economy. We are working to attract enterprises and talent, and we encourage cross-sector collaboration between AI and the financial services industry.

As with any new technology, we also recognise the challenges AI may pose to financial services and the economy in general. That's why, last October, we issued a policy statement on the responsible application of AI in financial markets. It sets out a ""dual track"" approach: promoting adoption while addressing risks such as cybersecurity, data privacy and intellectual property protection. We are also carefully assessing its impact in areas such as job displacement.

My second point is that our fintech solutions must look beyond Hong Kong's borders.

Hong Kong is already home to more than 1 100 fintech companies, ranging from digital banks to regtech providers. Many of these firms are expanding into Southeast Asia and across the Global South, where demand for innovative financial solutions is accelerating.

The Government actively supports this process. For example, the Hong Kong Investment Corporation partners with fintech companies to support their overseas ventures. And an increasing number of Mainland fintech firms are using Hong Kong to showcase and export their technologies to the world.

By helping them expand globally, we strengthen our own fintech sector, while contributing to financial inclusion and the region's economic development.

Concluding remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, innovation inevitably carries risks, but those risks must not deter us from the progress it presents. As the Chinese saying goes: ç¡éé¢¨åå¨éªå³°, or as translated: perilous peaks offer the best scenery.

Let us work together to ensure that Hong Kong continues to shine as a global beacon of financial innovation and the wide-ranging prosperity it promises.

Thank you."

Government posts second batch of land resumption notices for Second Phase Development of Yuen Long South New Development Area,2025-08-28 14:37,2025-08-28 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800349.htm,"The Lands Department (LandsD) today (August 28) posted the second batch of land resumption notices in accordance with section 4 of the Lands Resumption Ordinance (Chapter 124) for the Second Phase Development of Yuen Long South New Development Area (YLS NDA) to resume 68 private lots with a total area of about 4.1 hectares.

The private lots to be resumed this time are the sites with no application under the Enhanced Conventional New Town Approach received by the deadline in mid-May this year. The land concerned requires resumption to allow the Government to carry out works.

The above 68 private lots will revert to the Government upon the expiry of a period of three months from the date of affixing the notices (i.e. November 29, 2025). The Government will release the ex-gratia land compensation to the relevant land owners after land reversion. 

The land reversion date is the date of reversion of the ownership of the land in the Government. It is not the departure deadline of the affected households and business undertakings. Three months before the departure deadline of the affected households and business undertakings, the LandsD will post notices in the relevant areas. It is now estimated that the affected households and business undertakings will have to move out in March 2026. The LandsD is handling the compensation and rehousing matters of the affected persons at full steam. The LandsD and its appointed Community Liaison Service Team will maintain communication with the affected households and business undertakings, and provide them with updated information.

The first batch of land resumption notices involving about 56 hectares of land for the Second Phase Development of YLS NDA was posted on February 20 this year. The said land reverted to the Government on May 21, and is gradually being handed over to the Civil Engineering and Development Department for site formation and engineering infrastructure works.

Upon full development, the YLS NDA will provide about 32 900 additional housing units capable of accommodating a new population of about 98 700, and create about 13 700 job opportunities."
