盧寵茂教授亦趁機會與到診的香港長者交流，欣悉他們十分歡迎「試點計劃」，並讚揚服務順暢。他們感謝香港特別行政區（特區）政府推行有關計劃，又認為大灣區內新增服務點至21個，大大增加便利性，讓他們有更多就醫選擇和省卻舟車勞動。

盧寵茂教授說：「隨着三間試點醫療機構今日開展服務，《行政長官2024年施政報告》中宣布擴展『試點計劃』至大灣區九個內地城市的目標圓滿達成。『試點計劃』實現九市全覆蓋。短短兩年，醫療券在大灣區的服務點從香港大學深圳醫院的一院兩點，以十倍的增長擴展至共21個服務點（附件）；同時亦由只適用於深圳市擴展至大灣區九個內地城市全覆蓋。『試點計劃』為政策創新及兩地醫療合作立下重要里程碑，亦充分體現粵港兩地政府對跨境醫療協作的努力和承擔。」

「我再次衷心感謝廣東省衞生健康委員會和各市衞生部門對『試點計劃』的大力支持和協助，讓超過178萬名合資格香港長者受惠。同時，我亦衷心感謝『試點計劃』下19間試點醫療機構的全情投入及細緻安排，為香港長者提供優質的醫療服務。」

Secretary for Health inspects first-day operational arrangements at pilot medical institutions under Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme (with photos),2025-08-28 17:35,2025-08-28 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800329.htm,"The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, visited Peking University Shenzhen Hospital (PKUSZH) and Shenzhen Hospital of Southern Medical University (SHSMU) today (August 28) to inspect the operational arrangements on the first day of the service launch under the Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme, as well as to receive briefings from the hospital staff on the treatment flow for Hong Kong elderly persons and to understand the latest services and facilities of the hospitals.

Professor Lo also took the opportunity to engage with Hong Kong elderly persons attending the clinics and was pleased to learn that they welcomed the Pilot Scheme and applauded the smooth provision of services. The elderly persons expressed gratitude to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government for implementing the scheme and considered that the expansion to 21 service points in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) has greatly enhanced convenience, providing them with more medical treatment options and sparing them the burden of lengthy journeys.

Professor Lo said, ""Following the service launch of the three pilot medical institutions today, the goal of extending the Pilot Scheme to nine Mainland cities in the GBA as announced in 'The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address' has been fully achieved. The nine cities are fully covered under the Pilot Scheme. In just two years, the number of service points for using Elderly Health Care Vouchers (EHCVs) in the GBA has expanded from the two service points operated by the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital to tenfold with a total of 21 service points (see Annex). Additionally, the coverage has expanded from being applicable only in Shenzhen to full coverage of nine Mainland cities in the GBA. The Pilot Scheme marks a significant milestone for policy innovation and healthcare collaboration between the two places, fully demonstrating the Guangdong and Hong Kong governments' commitment and dedication to cross-boundary medical collaboration.

  ""I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude once again to the Health Commission of Guangdong Province and the health authorities of various cities for their strong support and assistance with the Pilot Scheme, benefitting more than 1.78 million eligible Hong Kong elderly persons. At the same time, I extend my sincere appreciation to the 19 pilot medical institutions under the Pilot Scheme for their wholehearted commitment and meticulous arrangements in providing high-quality healthcare services to Hong Kong elderly persons.""

He emphasised, ""The HKSAR Government will stay committed to fulfilling the important role of safeguarding the well-being of Hong Kong citizens by continuing to provide them with quality healthcare services and will not shift the responsibility of taking care of Hong Kong citizens' well-being to the Mainland healthcare system. The Pilot Scheme aims to offer elderly persons greater choices in using their EHCVs according to their individual circumstances. We will continue to assess and monitor the operation and usage of EHCVs in the pilot medical institutions and review the effectiveness of the Pilot Scheme in due course. Under the principle of complementarity and mutual benefits, we will continue to promote healthcare collaboration in different cities of the country to jointly build a 'Healthy Bay Area' and advance the strategy of 'Healthy China'.""

PKUSZH is a modern comprehensive Tier III Class A public hospital, which is invested in and established by the Shenzhen Municipal Government and assigned to integrate medical services, scientific research and teaching. It is also a high-level hospital of Guangdong Province and a designated medical institution under the measure of using Hong Kong-registered drugs and medical devices used in Hong Kong public hospitals in the GBA (Measure).

SHSMU is a municipal-level comprehensive Tier III Class A public hospital jointly established by the Shenzhen Municipal Government and Southern Medical University. It also stands as the sole university-affiliated hospital within the Qianhai Free Trade Zone undertaking concurrent missions in healthcare provision, teaching and scientific research and is a designated medical institution under the Measure.

再多三款新藥在「1+」機制下獲批  體現「好藥港用」,2025-08-28 17:15,2025-08-28 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800556.htm,"​政府發言人今日（八月二十八日）表示，再有三款新藥在「1+」藥物審批機制下獲批准在港註冊。該三款藥物分別用於治療甲狀腺眼病、復發或轉移性子宮頸癌，以及嚴重甲型或乙型血友病，能為病患者帶來更多醫治選擇，進一步體現「好藥港用」。

三款獲批新藥

香港特別行政區（特區）於二○二三年十一月一日起實施「1+」機制，便利用以治療嚴重或罕見疾病的新藥來港註冊，並已於去年十一月一日起將「1+」機制擴展至所有新藥，包括任何含新藥劑或生物元素成分的製品及藥物新適應症、疫苗以至先進療法製品。新藥若能提供符合要求的本地臨床數據，並經本地專家認可後，只須提交一個（而非原來的兩個）參考藥物監管機構，便可以在香港申請註冊。

上述三款新藥均已獲美國的藥物監管機構批核，並在「1+」機制下提交註冊申請。香港藥劑業及毒藥管理局轄下的註冊委員會在對申請人提交的臨床數據及相關資料作出審評及經徵詢本地專家的意見後，認為該些新藥符合相關安全、效能及素質標準，批准在香港註冊。衞生署已通知申請人有關審批結果。

有序邁向「第一層審批」

自「1+」機制生效以來，連同上述三款新藥，現時共有14款新藥按此機制獲批准註冊，其中五款新藥已獲納入醫院管理局藥物名冊。衞生署一直積極透過不同渠道宣傳「1+」機制，至今已收到160多間藥廠超個620個查詢，當中包括海外及內地藥廠。不少公司已表示有興趣在擴展的「1+」機制下為包括先進療法製品的藥物提交註冊申請。衞生署亦已推出「1+」新藥註冊申請前會面諮詢服務，於今年三月起先後舉辦多場簡介講座及新藥註冊工作坊，並計劃在今年第四季推出申請前諮詢會議，以提升處理相關申請的效率。

「1+」機制有助吸引更多來自世界各地的新藥來港註冊，讓病人有更多選擇，並強化本地的藥物審核能力和促進相關軟硬件和人才發展，有序邁向「第一層審批」，即可不依賴其他藥物監管機構，而直接根據臨床數據在本港審批藥物。

「香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心」將於明年年底成立，並由明年起分階段推行「第一層審批」新藥註冊機制，至二○三○年全面推行。衞生署會繼續積極推進「第一層審批」新藥註冊機制的準備工作，並逐步建立完善的藥械審批制度，為香港特區以至國家及其他地區的醫療健康發展注入強大動力，將香港打造為國際醫療創新樞紐。"
「慢病共治計劃」實施診症共付額年度調整及擴展服務對象,2025-08-28 17:15,2025-08-28 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800547.htm,"醫務衞生局今日（八月二十八日）公布，參與「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」）的家庭醫生每年按既定機制調整的篩查及治療階段診症共付額，將由下星期一（九月一日）起生效。此外，「慢病共治計劃」會分階段擴展服務對象，讓目前在醫院管理局（醫管局）普通科門診覆診而情況合適的病人，以及將於二○二八年結束的普通科門診公私營協作計劃（門診協作計劃）參加者參與。

「慢病共治計劃」採用共付模式，除政府資助外，參加者亦須負擔一定的共付額，以鼓勵市民成為自己健康的第一責任人。家庭醫生可自行釐定篩查階段的診症共付額（不多於120元）和治療階段的診症共付額，並可按既定機制每年調整一次。

就治療階段而言，九月一日調整共付額後與現時比較，仍然維持約有六成半服務點收取政府建議的150元或以下的診症共付額（617個服務點），共付額的中位數亦繼續維持在150元。現時參與計劃的971個服務點中，有874個（即90%）的共付額維持不變，有八個服務點的共付額會下調（下調幅度由30至150元不等，中位數為75元），而餘下的89個服務點的共付額會上調（上調幅度由20至300元不等，中位數為50元）。整體而言，治療階段診症共付額於來年的上調幅度為3.1%。至於篩查階段的診症共付額，有一個服務點會由政府建議的120元下調至100元。更新後的篩查及治療階段診症共付額列表已載於計劃專題網站供市民參考，而專題網站家庭醫生搜尋器所顯示的相關資料亦會在九月一日更新。

另外，為配合政府的基層醫療發展方向，醫務衞生局會分別由下月和明年年初開始，陸續以專函邀請合適的普通科門診病人，和現時門診協作計劃的參加者參加「慢病共治計劃」。所有選擇參加「慢病共治計劃」的病人，其共付額及服務安排與其他「慢病共治計劃」參加者一致。

醫管局於二○一四年推出門診協作計劃，資助長期在普通科門診覆診的病人在社區接受私營基層醫療服務。門診協作計劃只提供醫生診症及相關服務，目前有接近五萬名參加者，主要為糖尿病和高血壓患者，病人須繳付門診共付額。

 「慢病共治計劃」的服務較門診協作計劃更為全面，例如涵蓋跨專業服務（包括專屬護士診所、視光師、足部治療師、物理治療師和營養師）、有地區康健中心協調和提供其他健康管理課程等配套安排，以及設有達標獎勵等，未來亦會覆蓋更多慢性疾病。

門診協作計劃預計於二○二八年結束，計劃辦事處會與參與計劃的醫生保持溝通，及與病人個別跟進他們的後續選擇和安排。

「慢病共治計劃」自推出以來反應良好，至今已有超過15萬名市民參加計劃。截至今年八月二十日（臨時數字），超過九萬人已完成了篩查，其中約四成被診斷為血糖偏高、或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂，有三萬六千人已進入治療階段。政府會持續推廣「慢病共治計劃」，鼓勵市民積極預防及管理慢性疾病，從而提升全民健康。

市民如欲了解更多「慢病共治計劃」的詳情，可瀏覽專題網站（www.primaryhealthcare.gov.hk/cdcc/tc）或致電熱線2157 0500查詢。熱線周一至周六上午九時至晚上九時由專人接聽。"
"Three other new drugs approved under ""1+"" mechanism for benefits of good drugs",2025-08-28 17:15,2025-08-28 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800559.htm,"âA Government spokesman announced today (August 28) that three more new drugs submitted for registration under the new drug approval mechanism (""1+"" mechanism) have been approved for registration in Hong Kong. These three new drugs are respectively used to treat patients with thyroid eye disease, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer and severe hemophilia A or B, bringing more treatment options for patients and facilitating the availability of more good drugs for use in Hong Kong.

Three new drugs approved

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has implemented the ""1+"" mechanism since November 1, 2023, to facilitate the registration of new drugs used for the treatment of life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases in Hong Kong. With effect from November 1 last year, the ""1+"" mechanism has been extended to all new drugs, including all new chemical or biological entities and new indications, and vaccines and advanced therapy products. New drugs that are supported by local clinical data and recognised by local experts can be applied for registration in Hong Kong by submitting approval from one reference drug regulatory authority (instead of two in the past).

The above three products have been approved by the drug regulatory authority in the United States and submitted for registration applications under the ""1+"" mechanism. Having evaluated the clinical data and relevant information submitted by the applicant and advice given by local experts, the Registration Committee under the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Hong Kong considered that the new drugs satisfied the criteria of safety, efficacy and quality, and approved the registration of the new drugs. The Department of Health (DH) has already notified the applicants of the results of the applications.

Paving the way towards ""primary evaluation""

Since the implementation of the ""1+"" mechanism, a total of 14 new drugs, including the above three drugs, have been approved under this mechanism. Five of them have been listed in the Hospital Authority Drug Formulary. The DH has been promoting the ""1+"" mechanism through different channels and so far has received more than 620 enquiries from over 160 pharmaceutical companies, including those from overseas and the Mainland. Many companies have expressed interest in submitting applications for registration of their products, including advanced therapy products, under the extended ""1+"" mechanism. Since the launch of the consultation service for new drugs applications under the ""1+""mechanism in March this year, the DH has already held a number of briefing seminars and workshops. The DH will also have pre-new drug application meetings with potential ""1+"" registration applicants, starting from the fourth quarter of this year, to enhance the efficiency in processing relevant applications.

The ""1+"" mechanism serves to attract more new drugs from different parts of the world seeking approval for registration in Hong Kong, giving patients more choices and further strengthening the local capacity for drug evaluation while enhancing the development of relevant software, hardware and expertise with a view to progressing towards ""primary evaluation"", i.e. to directly approve applications for registration of drugs and medical devices based on clinical data in Hong Kong, without relying on other drug regulatory authorities.

The Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation will be established by the end of next year, and the DH will implement ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration in phases beginning next year, with full implementation by 2030. The DH will continue to proactively advance preparatory work for ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration and progressively establish a robust approval system for medical products, providing strong momentum for the development of healthcare in the HKSAR, the Mainland, and beyond, thereby transforming Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub."
Chronic Disease Co-care Pilot Scheme to implement annual consultation co-payment adjustments and expand service targets,2025-08-28 17:15,2025-08-28 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800552.htm,"  The Health Bureau announced today (August 28) that the annually adjusted consultation co-payment fees for screening and treatment phases of the Chronic Disease Co-care Pilot Scheme (CDCC Pilot Scheme), as allowed to be set by participating family doctors according to the established mechanism, will take effect from next Monday (September 1). In addition, the CDCC Pilot Scheme will expand its service clientele in phases to cover suitable patients currently attending the General Out-patient Clinics (GOPCs) of the Hospital Authority (HA), and participants of the General Outpatient Clinic Public-Private Partnership (GOPC PPP) Programme which is scheduled to conclude in 2028.

  Under the co-payment model of the CDCC Pilot Scheme, the Government provides a partial subsidy, while participants are required to pay a certain amount of co-payment fee, with a view to encouraging citizens to bear the primary responsibility for their own health. Family doctors are allowed to determine the consultation co-payment fees for the screening phase (not more than $120) and the treatment phase on their own, and have the fees adjusted once annually according to the established mechanism.

  Comparing the current situation with that after the co-payment adjustment for the treatment phase on September 1, the service points charging the Government-recommended consultation co-payment fees at $150 or below remain at approximately 65 per cent (617 service points), while the median co-payment remains at $150. Among the current 971 participating service points, 874 of them (i.e. 90 per cent) will keep their existing co-payment fees unchanged. Eight service points will reduce the co-payment fees (reductions ranging from $30 to $150 and the median is $75), while the remaining 89 service points will increase their co-payment fees (increases ranging from $20 to $300 and the median is $50). Overall, the rate of increase of the consultation co-payment fees for treatment phase is 3.1 per cent in the coming year. Regarding the co-payment fees for the screening phase, there will be one service point reducing the fee from the Government-recommended $120 to $100. The updated list of consultation co-payment fees for screening and treatment phases has been uploaded to the dedicated website of the Scheme for public reference. Relevant information on the webpage for searching family doctors will also be updated on September 1.

  Moreover, to dovetail with the Government's direction of primary healthcare development, the Health Bureau will invite suitable GOPC patients and existing GOPC PPP Programme participants by post, starting next month and early next year respectively, to join the CDCC Pilot Scheme. The co-payment fees and service arrangements for all patients opting to join the CDCC Pilot Scheme will be the same as other CDCC Pilot Scheme participants.

  The HA launched the GOPC PPP Programme in 2014 to subsidise patients being followed up in GOPCs to receive private primary healthcare services in the community. The GOPC PPP Programme only provides doctor consultations and related services, with currently around 50 000 participants who are mainly diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HT) patients. They are required to pay co-payment fees for the outpatient services.

  The CDCC Pilot Scheme provides a more comprehensive range of services to citizens as compared with the GOPC PPP Programme, for example, covering multidisciplinary services (including dedicated nurse clinics, optometrists, podiatrists, physiotherapists and dietitians), service co-ordination and other health management courses arranged by the District Health Centres, as well as the incentive mechanism. More chronic diseases will also be covered in the future.

  While the GOPC PPP Programme is expected to end in 2028, the programme office will maintain communication with the participating doctors and will follow up with the patients individually on their future choices and related arrangements.

  The CDCC Pilot Scheme has been well received by members of the public since its launch, with over 150 000 citizens joining the scheme to date. As at August 20 this year (provisional figures), over 90 000 participants have completed screenings, of which around 40 per cent have been diagnosed with prediabetes, DM, HT or hyperlipidaemia, while 36 000 of them have entered the treatment phase. The Government will continue to promote the CDCC Pilot Scheme to encourage citizens to prevent and manage chronic diseases proactively, thereby enhancing the overall health of the general public.

  For more details of the CDCC Pilot Scheme, members of the public may visit its dedicated website (www.primaryhealthcare.gov.hk/cdcc/en) or call the hotline at 2157 0500. Dedicated staff of the hotline will answer calls from 9am to 9pm from Mondays to Saturdays."

政府緊急事故監察及支援中心在演習期間啟動，行政長官李家超、政務司司長陳國基及保安局局長鄧炳強在中心督導。

李家超表示：「全球恐怖主義形勢錯綜複雜，香港作為國際城市，雖然整體安全穩定，但國際恐襲及本土恐怖主義的威脅不容忽視。特區政府各政策局和部門必須加強對不同形式恐怖襲擊的協調與應對能力。」

「各部門在這次大型反恐演習中各司其職，充分展現了應對恐襲事件時的專業能力，並將總結經驗，以進一步強化特區政府整體反恐工作。」

是次演習合共有約500名人員參與。除了保安局和反恐專責組的六個成員部門—即警務處、入境事務處、香港海關、懲教署、消防處及政府飛行服務隊外，海事處、政府化驗所、醫院管理局，以及啟德郵輪碼頭的人員亦積極參與及協助籌備演習。

反恐專責組亦非常重視公眾參與演習的元素，首次安排電視及網上直播，讓市民收看現場實況，提升反恐意識。另外，演習邀請接近200名來自多個不同界別和年齡層的社區和青少年團體義務參與。參與者在演習中扮演不同角色，親身體驗如何在緊急情況下應用「閃、避、求」應變指引，以保障自身和他人的安全。

為加強反恐準備，《行政長官2024年施政報告》提出設立三層防範機制，包括第一層（最高層）的行政長官反恐督導組，指導及制定反恐方針和策略；第二層的保安局局長反恐統籌組，協調各政策局和部門在反恐事宜上的合作；以及第三層的七個跨部門工作小組，跟進具體研究和執行反恐工作。李家超在行政長官反恐督導組首次會議上，指示各相關政策局和部門舉行大型跨部門反恐演練，進一步提升特區政府的反恐準備及應變能力。特區政府亦會因應風險評估及多方面因素，不時舉行各類型的反恐演習。

在「三層防範機制」的推動下，相關決策局和部門將持續多方面加強反恐準備，包括強化情報交流、擴展社區情報網絡、防範自我激化、深化公眾教育，以及舉辦更多元化的反恐演習，促進部門及公私營機構間的協作，全面提升香港的防禦能力。"
Large-scale interdepartmental counter-terrorism exercise BRAVELIGHT smoothly concludes,2025-08-28 17:05,2025-08-28 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800328.htm," The Inter-departmental Counter Terrorism Unit (ICTU) conducted a large-scale counter-terrorism (CT) exercise codenamed BRAVELIGHT at the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal today (August 28). The exercise simulated a scenario in which terrorists attempted to launch an attack upon arriving in Hong Kong via a cruise ship, staging a knife attack and shooting in the terminal lobby. Their accomplices subsequently took a passenger ship hostage, leading to a gunfight with the Police onboard.

 The Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre was activated during the exercise, overseen by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee; the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki; and the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung.

 Mr Lee said, “The global terrorism situation remains complex. As an international city, Hong Kong continues to enjoy overall safety and stability, but the threats posed by international and homegrown terrorism must not be neglected. Different policy bureaux and departments(B/Ds) of the HKSAR Government must strengthen their co-ordination and response capabilities to address various forms of terrorist attacks.

 “During this large-scale CT exercise, each department performed its respective duties, fully demonstrating its professional competence in responding to terrorist incidents. The relevant departments will consolidate the experience gained to further strengthen the overall CT work of the HKSAR Government.”

 About 500 personnel participated in the exercise. In addition to the Security Bureau and the six ICTU member departments, namely the Hong Kong Police Force, the Immigration Department, the Customs and Excise Department, the Correctional Services Department, the Fire Services Department and the Government Flying Service, staff from the Marine Department, the Government Laboratory, the Hospital Authority and the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal also actively participated and assisted in co-ordinating the exercise.

 The ICTU attaches great importance to public engagement. For the first time, the exercise was broadcast live on television and online, enabling members of the public to observe in real time and further enhance their CT awareness. Nearly 200 volunteers from various community and youth organisations across different sectors and age groups were invited to participate in the exercise. Participants took on different roles in the exercise, gaining firsthand experience in applying the “Run, Hide, Report” emergency response advisory to protect themselves and others in critical situations.

 To strengthen CT preparedness, the CE's 2024 Policy Address announced the establishment of the Three-tier Prevention Framework, comprising the Chief Executive Counter-terrorism Steering Group (CESG) at the first tier (top tier), which steers and formulates CT policies and directions; the Secretary for Security Counter-terrorism Co-ordinating Group at the second tier, which co-ordinates B/Ds' co-operation on CT matters; and seven interdepartmental working groups at the third tier, which follow up on specific studies and carry out CT work. Mr Lee directed at the first CESG meeting that relevant B/Ds should conduct a large-scale interdepartmental CT exercise to further enhance the HKSAR Government's CT preparedness and response capabilities. The HKSAR Government will also organise different types of CT exercise from time to time, based on risk assessments and various factors.

 Under the co-ordination of the Three-tier Prevention Framework, relevant B/Ds will continue to strengthen their CT preparedness in various areas, including enhancing intelligence exchange, expanding community intelligence networks, preventing radicalisation, enhancing public education and organising diverse CT exercises to foster collaboration between departments and private/public stakeholders, as well as bolster the overall defence capabilities of Hong Kong."

尊敬的各位嘉賓：

大家上午好。感謝廣東省法學會與廣州市法學會邀請我參與本次粵港澳大灣區法治論壇。論壇聚焦灣區的改革和法治，展開制度型開放新探索，對推動大灣區規則銜接與制度型開放具有重大意義。

立足「一國、兩制、三法域」，香港發揮普通法制度優勢，積極探索與灣區城市法治協同，服務制度型開放。以下我會圍繞論壇的主題，從四方面分享香港的實踐與思考：

第一，法律科技與區域法治建設。科技和人工智能迅速發展，為制度銜接帶來新機遇。律政司積極推動法律科技應用，參與本地大學科研團隊開發的第一個大語言模型的版本「港文通」，並支持市場開發更多適用的法律人工智能工具。

其中，律政司更推動香港的一邦國際網上仲調中心，與大灣區內不同的仲調機構共同構建大灣區線上爭議解決協作平台，加強灣區居民民商互動，推動灣區法治建設。

這些探索不但提升效能，更為大灣區規則銜接提供技術支持，以科技促進三地法律體系的兼容互補，推動區域法治融通與制度型開放。

第二，金融法治創新，堅實開放基礎。法治是金融創新的基石。香港持續完善金融法律框架，今年八月生效的《穩定幣條例》建立亞洲首個法律框架，涵蓋發牌、儲備管理及投資者保障機制，確保穩定幣市場穩健發展，展現鞏固國際金融中心的決心。我們將深化金融跨境合作，支持內地企業利用香港國際化融資平台拓展業務。

第三，香港國際一流的仲裁體系，服務制度型開放。香港是全球第二受歡迎的仲裁地，香港國際仲裁中心的仲裁規則同樣全球排名第二，去年受理案件數量和爭議總額再創新高。這得益於《紐約公約》的執行力和香港與內地各項的互助安排，進一步強化香港在兩地商業爭議仲裁的競爭力。

隨着國際調解院總部落戶，香港將與區內仲調機構加強合作，推動落實灣區標準，貢獻香港經驗。

第四，兩地企業重組合作機制深化規則銜接。當企業出現債務危機時，高效的重組不但維護企業價值，保護員工崗位，更提升債權人信心，優化投資環境。

二○二一年五月，香港與最高人民法院建立合作機制，容許香港清盤人就債務重組，可以在上海、廈門或深圳的法院申請認可和協助。內地破產管理人也可根據普通法尋求香港承認內地破產或重整程序。這機制提升兩地專業處理跨境重組的競爭力，並為跨法域規則銜接提供可複製的經驗。

大灣區法治建設需要創新思維與務實合作。香港樂於為共建世界級灣區貢獻「香港方案」。最後，預祝論壇圓滿成功，謝謝。"

  Thank you, Chair and fellow colleagues. AI is the key driver to overhaul our energy systems. AI will help us optimise energy production, distribution and consumption, ultimately leading to more resilient and adaptive energy systems. To this end, Hong Kong, China is proactively applying I&T (innovation and technology) and putting efforts and resources into advancing the development of AI. Taking this opportunity, I would like to share with you some examples of AI applications in the energy sector in Hong Kong, China.

 This year, we have launched Engentica, the first AI agent in the Building E&M (electrical and mechanical) industry that redefines intelligent infrastructure management. Leveraging Semantic AI and large language models, Engentica revolutionises facility management by providing real-time chiller optimisation and adjustments based on live weather data, automated fault diagnosis, and predictive maintenance, etc, contributing to enhanced operational efficiency and reliability of infrastructures.

 In addition, one of our power companies has introduced an advanced AI management system to monitor the company's critical power facilities. With the help of AI, the management system integrates and monitors real-time signals from about 3 000 sensors and cameras across the power company's electricity networks in the city, alerting engineering personnel to respond to incidents immediately when potential risks are detected.

 Last year, Hong Kong, China also showcased two innovative AI applications at the Knowledge Sharing Platform for the APEC Energy Smart Communities Initiative: the ChillStream - an AI-based Chiller Plant Optimisation System, and Power-hawk Inspector - a drone-based inspection system using AI to identify power grid defects. We are delighted that the two initiatives were recognised by fellow APEC member economies, receiving three awards at the ESCI (Energy Smart Communities Initiative) Best Practices Awards Program.

 With cutting-edge research, robust infrastructure and a diverse talent pool, Hong Kong, China provides an ideal platform for promoting AI solutions across the region. We look forward to collaborating and partnering with APEC economies on AI projects to leverage our shared expertise and resources to drive AI development."

å¾è¡åé¨é· (Director-General of the Economic Affairs Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Xu Weigang), Mary (Chairperson of the Hong Kong Association of Banks, Ms Mary Huen), å­«ç¸½ (Chairman of the Chinese Banking Association of Hong Kong, Mr Sun Yu), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is a great pleasure to speak to you, today, at this luncheon. I know most of you have already had a full and rewarding morning, and are no doubt looking forward to a fortifying lunch. With that in mind, I will keep my remarks brief and focused.

I understand that Eddie (Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Mr Eddie Yue) shared his perspectives on fintech regulation this morning, including the progress of a number of regulatory initiatives. Allow me to take a step back, outlining the Government's overarching vision for advancing financial innovation in Hong Kong.

Pro-innovation approach

First, the Hong Kong SAR Government is pro-innovation and pro-tech.

We all recognise that technologies are disrupting and reshaping the landscape of finance. From blockchain to artificial intelligence, these innovations allow financial transactions and settlements to be delivered faster, cheaper and more transparently. Yet, as with all transformative technologies, they also come with risks, presenting challenges to investor protection, cybersecurity, even financial security. Around the world, governments and financial regulators face the same fundamental question: to what extent, and at what pace, should we embrace innovative technologies?

For Hong Kong, the answer is clear. As a leading international financial centre, embracing new technologies is not an option. It is a necessity. To stay ahead of the curve, we must be proactive.

Our regulators play a facilitating role in driving financial innovation. A good example is the ""regulatory sandboxes"" implemented by our financial regulators. They allow innovators to test new technologies in a controlled setting, receiving timely regulatory feedback and refining their solutions before wider adoption. Through sandboxes, regulators and innovators collaborate, even working together to create new solutions.

Consider Project Ensemble. It enables industry participants to work with regulators, exploring tokenised asset use, assessing interoperability across platforms and helping define common industry standards. And it involves not only local parties but also overseas partners for cross-border use cases. As technologies evolve, so too must our platforms for experimentation. Over the past year, for example, the HKMA has introduced a sandbox for generative AI applications, as well as an incubator for distributed ledger technology.

These initiatives send a clear message to the market: that we welcome disruptive innovation, while ensuring that risks are identified and managed responsibly. This enables their adoption at scale, and with confidence.

Regulators and market enablers

That brings me to my second point: the role of our financial regulators.

In Hong Kong, regulators are entrusted with a dual mandate. They are not only supervisors who ensure regulatory compliance, but also enablers helping to shape the future of finance. This dual role is a defining feature of our regulatory philosophy.

Take the SFC (Securities and Futures Commission) for example. More than a regulator, it has been instrumental in driving a series of reforms to our stock market - going back to 2018. In fintech, the SFC is the regulator of digital-asset trading platforms. But it also works to expand digital-asset products for trading and listing.

As for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which leads Project Ensemble, it has issued two batches of tokenised green bonds worth HK$6.8 billion over the past two years, making Hong Kong one of the first governments in the world to issue such bonds. I'm pleased to note that preparations for a third batch are already under way.

Together, the Government and regulators lead by example, demonstrating Hong Kong's commitment to driving innovation in the financial sector.

Playing to our strengths

The third point I wish to emphasise is the importance of playing to our strengths.

Hong Kong is Asia's leading international financial centre. We are home to 70 of the world's top 100 banks and six of its top 10 insurers. And they are supported by a dynamic network of asset managers and professional service providers. Our regulatory standards align with the highest international benchmarks, and we contribute to global standard setting via international bodies such as the IOSCO (International Organization of Securities Commissions).

This combination of global connectivity, deep liquidity and world-class expertise makes Hong Kong an ideal environment for fintech development. For start-ups and innovators, launching here is effectively an international seal of approval: if a solution works in our sophisticated, well-regulated, globally connected market, it is far more likely to succeed elsewhere.

And it all comes together thanks to our ""one country, two systems"" framework, enabling Hong Kong to provide unparalleled connectivity between the Chinese Mainland and the rest of the world. That singular advantage also allows Hong Kong to be a natural testing ground for new technologies looking to expand into this region.

The ""Connect Schemes"" perfectly illustrate innovative cross-border financial collaboration. Starting with equities and now including bonds, ETFs and derivatives, they allow international investors to participate in Mainland markets, and Mainland investors to access global opportunities, through a closed-loop system - an innovation only Hong Kong can deliver.

And I believe there is plenty of room for Hong Kong to serve as a two-way platform for fintech solutions as well.

On digital assets

Let me now turn to digital assets, where Hong Kong has emerged as a pioneer.

Over the past few years, we have been building regulatory regimes that encourage tech innovation with suitable guardrails. From the two policy statements on digital assets released over the past couple of years, to the enactment of the Stablecoin Ordinance, and our recent consultation on over-the-counter dealing and custodian service, our trajectory has been clear and consistent. 

A few points are worth reiterating. First, we follow the ""same activity, same risk, same regulation"" principle, ensuring a transparent, fair and risk-based regime that adapts to innovation while protecting investors, consumers and financial security.

Second, we believe digital assets should serve the real economy. This is evident in the regulation of stablecoins, where licences will be granted only to applicants who can demonstrate real-world use cases with a convincing and sustainable business model. 

Third, building a vibrant ecosystem. Over the years, we have put in a holistic and forward looking strategy for digital assets. It goes well beyond regulation to broadening product offerings, modernising infrastructure, advancing cross-boundary use and nurturing talent - all aimed at enabling the sustainable and responsible development of our digital-asset sector.

Looking ahead

Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to share two more points about fintech development down the road.

First, artificial intelligence. When combined with blockchain and other emerging technologies, AI holds immense potential to transform financial services. Streamlining compliance, enhancing customer service, improving credit scoring and risk management are just a few examples of AI's promise. We believe there is substantial potential for AI to go further, to make financial services more efficient, inclusive and accessible.

A survey conducted by the HKMA's Academy of Finance last year revealed that 75 per cent of Hong Kong's financial institutions are already using or planning to use generative AI in their operations. This is a compelling indicator of how quickly the technology is being adopted here.

The Government has prioritised AI as a core industry under a broader ""AI+"" strategy, which seeks to embed AI across every sector of the economy. We are working to attract enterprises and talent, and we encourage cross-sector collaboration between AI and the financial services industry.

As with any new technology, we also recognise the challenges AI may pose to financial services and the economy in general. That's why, last October, we issued a policy statement on the responsible application of AI in financial markets. It sets out a ""dual track"" approach: promoting adoption while addressing risks such as cybersecurity, data privacy and intellectual property protection. We are also carefully assessing its impact in areas such as job displacement.

My second point is that our fintech solutions must look beyond Hong Kong's borders.

Hong Kong is already home to more than 1 100 fintech companies, ranging from digital banks to regtech providers. Many of these firms are expanding into Southeast Asia and across the Global South, where demand for innovative financial solutions is accelerating.

The Government actively supports this process. For example, the Hong Kong Investment Corporation partners with fintech companies to support their overseas ventures. And an increasing number of Mainland fintech firms are using Hong Kong to showcase and export their technologies to the world.

By helping them expand globally, we strengthen our own fintech sector, while contributing to financial inclusion and the region's economic development.

Concluding remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, innovation inevitably carries risks, but those risks must not deter us from the progress it presents. As the Chinese saying goes: ç¡éé¢¨åå¨éªå³°, or as translated: perilous peaks offer the best scenery.

Let us work together to ensure that Hong Kong continues to shine as a global beacon of financial innovation and the wide-ranging prosperity it promises.

Thank you."

The private lots to be resumed this time are the sites with no application under the Enhanced Conventional New Town Approach received by the deadline in mid-May this year. The land concerned requires resumption to allow the Government to carry out works.

The above 68 private lots will revert to the Government upon the expiry of a period of three months from the date of affixing the notices (i.e. November 29, 2025). The Government will release the ex-gratia land compensation to the relevant land owners after land reversion. 

The land reversion date is the date of reversion of the ownership of the land in the Government. It is not the departure deadline of the affected households and business undertakings. Three months before the departure deadline of the affected households and business undertakings, the LandsD will post notices in the relevant areas. It is now estimated that the affected households and business undertakings will have to move out in March 2026. The LandsD is handling the compensation and rehousing matters of the affected persons at full steam. The LandsD and its appointed Community Liaison Service Team will maintain communication with the affected households and business undertakings, and provide them with updated information.

The first batch of land resumption notices involving about 56 hectares of land for the Second Phase Development of YLS NDA was posted on February 20 this year. The said land reverted to the Government on May 21, and is gradually being handed over to the Civil Engineering and Development Department for site formation and engineering infrastructure works.

Upon full development, the YLS NDA will provide about 32 900 additional housing units capable of accommodating a new population of about 98 700, and create about 13 700 job opportunities."

 The 2025 Election Committee Subsector (ECSS) By-elections will be held on September 7 (Sunday). The Chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission, Mr Justice David Lok, inspected the hands-on training session conducted by the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) today (August 28) for the electoral staff of polling stations, including the operation of the Electronic Poll Register (EPR) System and contingency measures for special situations to get them well prepared for the By-elections.

 Five ordinary polling stations (OPSs) and one dedicated polling station located in a police station will be set up for the ECSS By-elections. The EPR System will be used at the OPSs for issuing ballot papers to voters. The staff participating in the training today will perform duties in the operation of the OPSs, including ballot paper issuance on the polling day. This training focuses on hands-on practice and scenario-based exercises, aiming to enhance their understanding of the operation of the polling stations, such as using the EPR System, and familiarise themselves with the arrangements for activating corresponding fallback plans when needed to maintain normal operation of the polling stations under unforeseen situations and minimise the inconvenience caused to voters.

 Mr Justice Lok said that this hands-on training session could enable the staff to get familiar with the relevant workflow and details of the operation of the polling stations, as well as contingency plans in case of unforeseen situations. He thanked the electoral staff for their joint efforts and dedication in ensuring that all polling procedures are in compliance with the relevant legislations and guidelines, and that the poll would be conducted orderly and efficiently, in an open, honest and fair manner.

The REO has been hosting different training sessions and simulation exercises for electoral staff to deepen their understanding of their work while at the same time strengthen the co-ordination and response capabilities among staff with different responsibilities for making a detailed and comprehensive preparation for the upcoming By-elections and ensuring that the polling and counting processes will be carried out smoothly."
Speech by SEE at thematic session two of APEC Energy Ministerial Meeting in Korea (English only) (with photo),2025-08-28 12:52,2025-08-28 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800391.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, at ""Thematic Session 2: Strengthening Grid Security and Reliability"" of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Energy Ministerial Meeting held in Busan, Korea, today (August 28):

 Thank you, Chair and fellow colleagues. Maintaining a robust grid infrastructure is essential to ensuring a reliable and stable electricity supply. In addition to the challenges related to ensuring adequate capital investment, competent management and timely adoption of latest technologies, we also face natural challenges. The impact of climate change on Hong Kong, China is increasing. To fight against possible damages by inclement weather, power companies in Hong Kong are using advanced technologies such as AI-driven live monitoring systems of our critical power facilities, as well as state-of-the-art forecasting models on flooding projections for targeted reinforcements of the grid.

 As to using technologies to make our grid more resilient, power companies in Hong Kong, China have been using smart grid technologies such as the Smart Metering System, grid automation and condition monitoring of transmission and distribution systems. Through real-time monitoring of electricity consumption patterns for households, providing energy consumption trends to users and warnings on unusual surges in power uses, the system enables individual households to identify rooms for energy conservation, contributing to the energy saving progress of our city. The system may also help detect early anomalies at the consumer end for the power companies' early attention, which will make preventive maintenance more efficient and timely. As of now, the system has covered around more than 90 per cent of the meter population in the city and is expected to fully cover Hong Kong, China by the end of this year.

 To help suppress the peak demand and stabilise renewable energy connected to the power system, one of our power companies has connected to a pumped storage power station in our neighbouring province for more than three decades. The pumped storage power system, with installed capacity of 2400 megawatts, serves an important role to store surplus energy generated and as backup electricity capacity.

 Power companies in Hong Kong are enhancing grid resilience by application of advanced technology in the power supply infrastructure. They have adopted advanced monitoring and management systems of the health conditions of the transmission cables and electricity substations, with a view to identifying abnormalities and carrying out maintenance at an early stage. The systems have made possible real-time monitoring of the health status of the transmission and distribution network, enhancing power companies' capabilities against possible threats to the power networks and reducing the occurrence of voltage dips and power interruptions.

 We will continue to strengthen regional co-operation and work with the power companies to expand transmission capacity and modernise the power grids for better reliability, adaptability and resilience.

 Thank you, Chair."
Speech by SEE at thematic session one of APEC Energy Ministerial Meeting in Korea (English only) (with photo) ,2025-08-28 11:53,2025-08-28 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800337.htm," Following is the speech by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, at ""Thematic Session 1: Electricity Expansion for a Stable Supply"" of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Energy Ministerial Meeting held in Busan, Korea, today (August 28):

 Thank you, Chair. Good morning fellow colleagues. As a vibrant metropolis and major international financial centre in the world, Hong Kong, China faces surging demand in electricity driven by the rapid expansion of our innovation and technology sector, in particular the increasing number of advanced manufacturing facilities and data centres in the city. Resilient and secure energy supply is of utmost importance to Hong Kong, China.

 The electricity market in Hong Kong, China is regulated through the Scheme of Control Agreements signed between the Government and the two power companies. The Agreements set out the obligations of the power companies, and framework for the Government to monitor the companies' financial, technical and environmental performances. The Government conducts an annual tariff review with the two power companies to closely examine their tariff proposals. Incentive schemes are in place to encourage the power companies to promote energy efficiency and conservation.

 With these efforts, Hong Kong, China enjoys one of the most reliable electricity supplies in the world and at the same time, keeps our tariffs at an affordable level. Households in the city on average spend around only 2 per cent of their expenditure for their electricity bills.

 Looking to the future, we have adopted ""net-zero electricity generation"" as one of the major decarbonisation strategies. In this regard, we have stopped building new coal-fired generating units since 1997, and will cease using coal for daily electricity generation by 2035. Also, Hong Kong, China's first offshore LNG (liquefied natural gas) receiving terminal has commenced operation since 2023. It enables Hong Kong, China to procure natural gas at more competitive prices by diversifying the sources of natural gas supply, as well as enhances the stability and security of energy supply, providing strong support for Hong Kong's energy transition.

 As a result, the current share of coal in electricity generation has reduced from about half 10 years ago to about one-fifth, while the share of natural gas has significantly increased from about a quarter to more than half, and a quarter is nuclear and renewable energy.

 Our objective is to raise the share of zero-carbon energy in Hong Kong, China's fuel mix for electricity generation to about 60 per cent to 70 per cent by 2035. We are investing in the necessary infrastructure to increase our capacity to import zero-carbon energy.

 The increase in the share of clean energy in our fuel mix will make the city less susceptible to fluctuation in prices of natural gas. This helps us ensure a stable electricity tariff.

 Hong Kong, China will continue to explore and study different zero-carbon energy solutions in accordance with the city's long-term development needs, with a view to maintaining a stable and safe electricity supply and contributing the sustainable development of the APEC region.

 Thank you."

Applications open for six kindergarten premises,2025-08-28 11:30,2025-08-28 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800296.htm,"âThe Education Bureau (EDB) announced today (August 28) that six new estate kindergarten premises are open for applications by eligible applicant bodies under the Kindergarten Premises Allocation Exercise 2025. Details of the six kindergarten premises are set out in the Annex.

""The six new estate kindergarten premises, each providing six orseven classrooms, are located in Sham Shui Po District, Tuen Mun District, North District and Yuen Long District, and will be available between 2026 and 2027. The EDB is entrusted by the Hong Kong Housing Authority to nominate operators for the kindergarten premises. The Exercise will be carried out on a competitive basis,"" a spokesman for the EDB said.

  Since the implementation of the Kindergarten Education Scheme (the Scheme) in the 2017/18 school year, apart from continuing to help kindergartens improve the environments of their premises, the EDB endeavours to provide more kindergarten premises owned by the Government for eligible applicant bodies to compete fairly for reprovisioning or operating kindergartens, which not only enables a reduction in rental expenses but also allows them to enjoy quality school premises. In addition, the EDB has adopted a streamlined mechanism starting from 2021 for assessing applications for nomination of suitable operators for kindergarten premises to reduce applicant bodies' administrative work.

 Non-profit-making kindergartens, especially those bearing high rental expenses with dilapidated school environments and facilities, and facing a surplus of kindergarten places in the district, are encouraged to apply for the above-mentioned kindergarten premises. The EDB will accord priority to kindergartens under the Scheme applying for relocation. Applications for operating new kindergartens will only be considered if no suitable applicants are found for relocation. Quality of education is the prime consideration. The EDB will take into account the operation plan, track record of school operation and relocation needs (if applicable) of the applicant bodies. The applicant body should be exempted from tax under Section 88 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance. 

The application form, information on the operation plan, points to note and other reference materials for the Kindergarten Premises Allocation Exercise can be downloaded from the EDB's homepage atwww.edb.gov.hk/en/edu-system/preprimary-kindergarten/allocation-of-kg/latest-news.html. The EDB will provide a template for preparation of the operation plan and set out the selection criteria in the ""Points to Note"" for applicant bodies' reference. Applicant bodies should carefully read the basic requirements and relevant instructions as stipulated in the ""Points to Note"" before submitting applications.

The duly completed application form, information on the operation plan, list of operating schools run by the applicant body (if any) and supporting documents should reach the EDB Kindergarten Education Division (Room 1432, 14/F, Wu Chung House, 213 Queen's Road East, Wan Chai, Hong Kong) by 5pm on October 27. Late applications or those not duly completed will not be processed. For enquiries, please contact EDB staff at 28926415."

胡英明專員（廉政專員）、霍啟剛議員（中國香港體育協會暨奧林匹克委員會副會長）、Mr Moray Taylor-Smith（香港賽馬會保安、誠信審查及資訊安全事務執行總監唐德誠）、Mr David Simmonds（香港公司治理公會會長司馬志）、各位體育界朋友、各位傳媒朋友：

大家早上好。今日我很高興可以出席由中國香港體育協會暨奧林匹克委員會（港協暨奧委會）、香港廉政公署、香港賽馬會及香港公司治理公會成立的體育管治誠信聯盟啓動禮。

體育管治誠信聯盟除了是一個加強溝通聯繫的平台外，最重要它會透過提供專業法律和會計服務支援、防貪諮詢、為體育總會的董事會成員及高級管理人員度身訂造體育治理專業資格課程等途徑，提升體育界的管治和誠信。這個目標與特區政府推動提升體育界的專業管治水平是完全一致。

我對於體育界，特別是體育總會的誠信和企業管治是有期望，亦有要求，因此我親身非常關注這方面的發展、具體工作方向和進度。

特區政府與港協暨奧委會在過去幾年積極推動進一步提升體育總會的機構管治水平。非常感謝港協暨奧委會努力地開展工作，在二○二○年十月已展開機構管治檢討工作，並於二○二四年十一月底公布了檢討報告及《機構管治守則》，要求其屬下體育總會於二○二六年底之前落實執行《守則》。自檢討報告及《守則》公布後，各個體育總會正積極執行各項建議，有些已初見成效。

體育總會是特區政府推行體育政策的重要合作夥伴之一。它們在負責推廣和發展有關體育項目，亦肩負培訓運動員和教練，以及選拔運動員代表香港參加國際性賽事的重任。體育總會對於提升香港的體育水平及增強香港體育界在國際的影響力和話語權擔當着重要的角色，而體育總會的管治是否具效率，主事人是否具備誠信，是直接影響總會表現、運動員士氣及成績，以及該項目能否蓬勃發展的主要因素。

近年，我們很開心看到香港運動員在國際體壇取得驕人成績，剛剛在成都舉行的世界運動會（世運會），香港隊的運動員就勇奪三金兩銀一銅的成績，打破中國香港隊過往參與世運會的記錄。運動員取得佳績，除了自己辛勤鍛鍊外，體育總會的支持亦非常重要。因此，體育總會實踐良好的機構管治對於推動香港體育進一步發展，並在國際比賽中爭取更好的成績，讓中國香港運動員在國際體壇的舞台上發光發亮絕對有密不可分的關係。

所以，我鼓勵各體育總會積極參與體育管治誠信聯盟的活動，好好利用這個專業平台，全面提升機構管治水平。我知道聯盟非常有效率，在今日的啓動禮後，香港廉政公署的同事會馬上和各體育總會進行體育總會誠信領導課程。我期待見到各體育總會在機構管治有快速的進步，大家同心協力，讓香港體育發展成一項為充滿活力的產業和推動發展的動力。

藉這個機會，我想感謝港協暨奧委會、（香港）廉政公署、（香港）賽馬會，以及香港公司治理公會。你們不單是各自領域的翹楚，更運用你們的專業協助體育界提升管治誠信，攜手推動新風氣，建立健全的管治制度、具誠信的文化，以及透明高效的處事標準，我希望這些都能夠紮根於香港的體育界。

我祝願體育管治誠信聯盟的工作能夠蒸蒸日上，今日的體育總會誠信領導課程成果豐碩，參與的朋友滿載而歸。

提一提，今日是十五運會（第十五屆全國運動會）第一日開始售票的日子，一息間在十時就可以透過線上購票，當然需要預先登記，未登記的可以先登記，或上網登記亦可。如果線下購票，中國旅行社有11間分行供大家線下購票。希望我們加強管治誠信之餘，也多多支持中國香港隊運動員，讓他們在全運會得享主場之利。

多謝大家。"

The theme of the session was ""Building Hong Kong into an international hub for high-calibre talent"".

Since its establishment, the CETT has been closely engaging with different stakeholders across the community. It earlier met with the presidents of universities, representatives from the innovation and technology sector, etc. and attended the Ante Chamber Exchange Session of the Legislative Council to pool wisdom and ideas and enhance collaboration, with a view to further advancing the integrated development of education, technology and talent as well as the work of the CETT, and providing solid support for the reform and innovation of Hong Kong's development. The Panel of Advisors serves as a high-level exchange platform with members from various sectors of society, including community leaders and professionals from different fields. There will be a specific discussion theme for each engagement session to facilitate focused and in-depth exchanges.

At the engagement session today, the Panel of Advisors to the CETT engaged in in-depth discussions on the objective of building Hong Kong into an international hub for high-calibre talent. The Panel of Advisors affirmed the effectiveness of talent attraction measures of the current-term Government. Given external challenges, Hong Kong should more precisely target the positioning of the eight centres and timely refine the measures to further enhance the diversity of the talent pool and effectiveness of the talent attraction measures. The Government should also enhance training and use of local talent to strengthen the talent support for the future development of Hong Kong. The Panel of Advisors also agreed to intensify efforts to attract teaching and research talent to establish an international education hub, and to leverage the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone to provide more development opportunities for promising technology start-ups and talent.

The session also reviewed the latest situation regarding Hong Kong's overall population and labour force, the progress in talent attraction, and an overview of talent retention. In the face of an ageing population and pressure on labour supply, the Panel of Advisors supported the Government’s introduction of timely and appropriate measures in response to the challenges.

Mr Chan expressed gratitude for the members' acceptance of the appointments, and looked forward to working closely with the members to pool wisdom and ideas for comprehensively promoting the integrated development of education, technology and talent.

 The Final Judging and the Awards Presentation Ceremony were held in Shanghai yesterday (August 26) and today (August 27) respectively. The Hong Kong delegation, comprising 13 teams from various enterprises and institutions, performed outstandingly in the competition, with Territory North Group winning the Grand Award and Best SmartEnvironment Award with their solution ""Hong Kong Environmental Database"", while Metro Maestro claimed the Best SmartMobility Award with their solution ""Passenger Route Choice Simulation"". Some of the contesting entries will be nominated to compete for the national 2025 ""Data Element x"" competition jointly organised by the National Data Administration and relevant departments, further showcasing Hong Kong's I&T strengths.

 Mr Wong remarked, ""In response to the national strategy of unleashing the multiplier effect of data elements, the governments of Hong Kong and Shanghai have jointly organised this competition again this year to deepen collaboration in digital technology, thus driving high-quality economic and social development in both cities. In April this year, the DPO and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Data signed a Memorandum of Understanding between Shanghai and Hong Kong on Digital Economy Co-operation (the MOU) to further deepen I&T co-operation and promote the joint development of the digital economy in both cities, thereby opening up deeper and broader collaboration prospects for the I&T industries between the two places."" He also extended his heartfelt congratulations to the winning teams and encouraged all participants to continue striving for breakthroughs and progress in innovation and data application for making greater contributions to the country and society.

 In addition, Mr Wong called on the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Data today and cochaired a mid-term review meeting following the signing of the MOU, with the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Data, Dr Shao Jun. During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on deepening collaboration on areas of the digital economy, digital transformation and data element development between the two places, which included the promotion of mutual authentication of corporation identities, the promotion of connections of the governments' platforms and the support for the innovative application of open data. Mr Wong expressed his gratitude to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Data for its prompt efforts in compiling a list of practical and feasible co-operation work items with Hong Kong that were in line with the I&T developments in both cities after the signing of the MOU. This will help enhance the joint development of I&T and the digital economy between Shanghai and Hong Kong, thereby achieving mutual benefits.

謝展寰在開幕大會上發言時表示：「在『一國兩制』下，中國香港繼續是全球最自由的經濟體和世界第三最具競爭力的國際金融中心，並維持普通法制度。我們會繼續作為聯通世界的平台和樞紐，發展新能源解決方案，以多元化電力資源支持對能源需求巨大的人工智能和相關產業的發展。同時，我們會持續利用創新科技提升能源效率，使新技術得以持續發展。」

亞太經合組織經濟體的能源消耗量約佔全球百分之六十，謝展寰指出，在社會各界共同努力下，截至二○二二年，中國香港以二○○五年為基準年，總體能源強度已降低超過30%。儘管過去20年的用電量增長了15%，但發電產生的二氧化硫、氮氧化物和顆粒物排放分別減少了98%、77%和86%。香港已於二○一年碳達峰，相較峰值，目前碳排放量已減少約四分之一。

香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）致力於二○三五年前把香港的碳排放量從二○○五年的水平減半，並在二○五○年前實現碳中和。特區政府已定立目標，在二○三五年或之前停止使用燃煤作為日常發電，並提高零碳能源在發電燃料組合中所佔的比例至約六至七成。

謝展寰亦指出，特區政府正積極應用人工智能改善電網管理，提高電力系統韌性；綠色金融方面，二○二四年在香港安排發行的綠色與可持續債務總額超過840億美元，連續七年位居亞太區第一；此外，香港不時舉行大型綠色活動，如「香港綠色周」和國際環保博覽，促進各界交流合作。

SEE attends APEC Energy Ministerial Meeting in Korea (with photos),2025-08-27 19:10,2025-08-27 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/27/P2025082700559.htm,"The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Energy Ministerial Meeting (EMM) held in Busan, Korea, today (August 27). Under the theme ""Building a Sustainable Tomorrow"" for APEC this year, the meeting will focus discussions on topics under three priorities: ""Connect, Innovate, Prosper"".

 Speaking at the opening session, Mr Tse said, ""Under the 'one country, two-systems' principle, Hong Kong, China remains to be the freest economy of the world and the world's third most competitive international financial centre, and operates under the common law system. We will continue to serve as a platform and hub to connect the world to develop new energy solutions to diversify power resources to support the development of energy-hungry artificial intelligence and related industries. At the same time, we should not forget innovation to improve energy efficiency to make new technological developments sustainable.""

 APEC economies consume approximately 60 per cent of the world's energy. Mr Tse pointed out that with the concerted efforts of different sectors of the community, as of 2022, the aggregate energy intensity in Hong Kong, China has decreased by over 30 per cent, using 2005 as the base year.While the electricity consumption in the past 20 years has increased by 15 per cent, the emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates due to power generation have been reduced by 98 per cent, 77 per cent and 86 per cent respectively. After Hong Kong reached its carbon peak in 2014, the carbon emissions have been reduced by about a quarter compared to the peak.

 The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government endeavours to cut the city's carbon emissions by half before 2035 compared to the 2005 level, and achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. The HKSAR Government has set the target to phase out coal for daily electricity generation by 2035, and increase the share of zero carbon energy in the fuel mix for electricity generation to about 60 to 70 per cent by 2035.

 Mr Tse also shared that the HKSAR Government has been embracing AI to improve grid management and strengthen the resilience of power supply system. On green finance, the total green and sustainable debt issued in Hong Kong in 2024 exceeded US$84 billion, ranking first in the Asian market for seven consecutive years. Furthermore, Hong Kong holds green mega events from time to time, such as the Hong Kong Green Week and Eco Expo Asia, to strengthen liaison and co-operation between different sectors.

 Mr Tse will join discussion sessions tomorrow (August 28) and have bilateral meetings with representatives from other APEC member economies."
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-08-27 19:06,2025-08-27 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/27/P2025082700707.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 27), one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

The new case involves a 34-year-old male living in Central and Western District. An initial investigation revealed that he travelled to Sri Lanka on August 15. During his stay, he was bitten by mosquitoes. While still in Sri Lanka, he developed a fever, headache and joint pain on August 19, followed by a rash on August 24. His fever subsided before he returned to Hong Kong on August 25. Due to persistent joint pain, he attended a private hospitalfor treatment yesterday (August 26). His blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing. Since the patient was afebrile before arriving in Hong Kong, he was no longer infectious to mosquitoes and did not require hospitalisation in Hong Kong. His household contact, who travelled to Sri Lanka with him, is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

Since the patient stayed in Sri Lanka during the incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing and it has reported the case to the health authority of Sri Lanka.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 12 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

""According to the World Health Organization, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks this year, and as of July this year, over 240 000 cases had been reported in 16 countries/regions worldwide. Of these cases, about 90 were fatal. High temperatures and rainfall levels in summer continue to pose a risk of outbreaks of various mosquito-borne diseases in Hong Kong and around the world, members of the public must remain vigilant. As the new school year is about to begin, the CHP urged the schools to follow the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)'s anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. They should also remind the staff members and students to enact mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases on campus,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui said.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The FEHD continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

â
âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising them on mosquito-borne disease prevention and tips on travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. Moreover, the Visiting Health Teams have also reminded all residential care homes for the elderly in Hong Kong to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of mosquito-borne diseases.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite (www.chp.gov.hk/en/static/104022.html).

Dr Tsui reminded members of the public that they must take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have a travel history. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

ââ
âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Opening speech by SEE at APEC Energy Ministerial Meeting in Korea (English only),2025-08-27 18:42,2025-08-27 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/27/P2025082700697.htm," Following is the opening speech by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, at the opening session of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Energy Ministerial Meeting held in Busan, Korea, today (August 27):

 Good afternoon, Chair and fellow colleagues. Allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy of the Republic of Korea, for hosting the APEC Energy Minister Meeting and the warm hospitality extended to our delegation.

 Sustainability and prosperity are not mutually exclusive, and to do so, we need to collaborate and think outside the box. Hong Kong, China has positioned herself as a super connector. Under the ""one country, two-systems"" principle, Hong Kong, China remains to be the freest economy of the world, the world's third most competitive international financial centre, and operates under the common law system. We will continue to serve as a platform and hub to connect the world to develop new energy solutions to diversify power resources to support the development of energy-hungry AI and related industries. At the same time, we should not forget innovation to improve energy efficiency to make new technological developments sustainable.

 APEC economies consume approximately 60 per cent of the world's energy. APEC's Energy Intensity Reduction Goal is to reduce APEC's aggregate energy intensity by 45 per cent by 2035, against the 2005 level. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the community, as of 2022, the aggregate energy intensity in Hong Kong, China has decreased by over 30 per cent.

 While the electricity consumption in the past 20 years has increased by 15 per cent, the emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates due to power generation have been reduced by 98 per cent, 77 per cent and 86 per cent respectively.

 Hong Kong, China reached its carbon peak in 2014. Compared to the peak, our carbon emissions have been reduced by about a quarter now. Our per capita carbon emissions in 2023 were about 4.4 tonnes. On this foundation, Hong Kong commits to strive to further cut our carbon emissions by half before 2035 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2050.

 On electricity generation, we will phase out coal for daily electricity generation by 2035, and increase the share of zero carbon energy from a quarter as of today to about 60 to 70 per cent by 2035. We are in good progress towards our target of reducing the electricity consumption in commercial buildings by 15 to 20 per cent, and 10 to 15 per cent for residential buildings by 2035. About 3.7 billion kWh of electricity has been conserved in 2024 compared to 2015.

 Hong Kong, China has been embracing artificial intelligence and Internet of Things to improve grid management, including the use of AI management system to monitor critical power facilities and to strengthen the resilience of power supply system.

 On green finance, in 2024, the total green and sustainable debt issued in Hong Kong, China exceeded US$84 billion, making Hong Kong, China the top green financing centre in the Asian market for seven consecutive years since 2018.

 Hong Kong, China is also home to green mega events. We will be launching our second Hong Kong Green Week on September 8, followed by the 20th Eco Expo Asia in end-October, where government officials and industry leaders gather to share, collaborate and innovate. Allow me to close my remarks by extending my warmest invitation to you all to participate in the upcoming events in September and October in Hong Kong, China. Thank you."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-08-27 18:30,2025-08-27 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/27/P2025082700687.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月二十七日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱的輸入個案。

最新個案資料

新增個案涉及一名居於中西區的34歲男子。初步調查顯示，他於八月十五日到斯里蘭卡，在當地逗留期間曾被蚊叮咬，並於八月十九日起在斯里蘭卡出現發燒、頭痛及關節痛，八月二十四日起出現皮疹。他在八月二十五日回港前已經退燒，但因關節持續疼痛，昨日（八月二十六日）到私家醫院求診。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。由於病人抵港前已經退燒，抵港後對蚊子不具傳染性，因此無需入院。一名早前與他一同到斯里蘭卡的家居接觸者現時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人於潛伏期身處斯里蘭卡，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報斯里蘭卡衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得12宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據世界衞生組織的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。今年全球多國爆發基孔肯雅熱，截至今年七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗個案，當中約90宗為死亡個案。夏季溫度及雨量處於高水平，令多種蚊傳疾病在香港，以至全球爆發的風險持續，市民不能掉以輕心。由於新學年即將開始，中心呼籲學校按照食物環境衞生署（食環署）的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，務必提醒教職員及學生，應時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。」

繼續加強防控

食環署繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

​為加強長者對預防蚊傳疾病的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊已透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解相關疾病的預防及提供外遊健康建議。此外，外展分隊亦已提醒全港所有安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關蚊傳疾病的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成10種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，無論在本地或是外遊期間都必須時刻採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施。若出現相關病徵，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後，應立即求醫，並通知醫生相關旅遊史。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
