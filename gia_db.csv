Court users may use iCMS for personal injuries cases in High Court and seek technical assistance on case initiation ,2025-10-20 12:40,2025-10-20 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000294.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Judiciary:

 The Judiciary announced that starting from October 30, the integrated Court Case Management System (iCMS) will be extended (Note)to cover personal injuries cases (HCPI) in the Court of First Instance of the High Court.

 The iCMS provides a series of electronic services, including sending and receiving case-specific court documents to and from the courts (e-filing), inspecting or searching filed documents and other case-related information held by the courts, searching cause books, and making payments for court services. The Judiciary is planning to make it mandatory for all legally represented parties to use e-filing under the iCMS (where available) as from the latter half of 2026.

 With the iCMS, there is no need to visit the High Court Building to scan (this function is available to Litigants-in-Person only) and upload the electronic copy of the document to be filed using the self-service kiosks located at the Resource Centre for Unrepresented Litigants or make payments in the Accounts Office for paper filing.

 To facilitate law firms' early migration from conventional paper mode to the iCMS in preparation for mandatory use in 2026, the Judiciary is inviting all law firms to make an appointment with the Judiciary for technical assistance on using the iCMS, either at the High Court Building or their own offices, when they are initiating a new case of an iCMS-enabled case type (including HCPI upon its rollout on October 30) for the first time. Taking into account the law firms' response and available resources, the Judiciary may require all law firms initiating a new case through paper filing to go through this assisted e-filing process for the purpose of enhancing training on iCMS before mandatory e-filing. To encourage migration to the iCMS, a 20 per cent concession is offered to iCMS users for three years on fee items of the High Court that are primarily or directly related to the electronic handling of court documents.

 Eligible users, including parties of ongoing or new e-proceedings and their legal representatives (if any), need to register for a user account to access the full range of services under the iCMS. Unregistered users can only use limited iCMS services, mainly searching for electronic documents that are open to public inspection. Registration is free of charge.
 
 The iCMS can be accessed using personal computers or mobile devices with an Internet connection, commonly used operating systems and browsers. It operates around the clock, except during system maintenance. Any e-filing and e-payment received under the iCMS after the registry and the accounts office are normally closed to the public (i.e. after 5.30pm on a working day) will be deemed to be received at the start of the normal opening hours of the registry and the accounts office on the following working day.

 For more details about the iCMS, including its technical requirements, please visit the dedicated webpage on e-Courts of the Judiciary website at www.judiciary.hk/en/e_courts/index.html.

 For enquiries, please call the general enquiry hotline at 2477 1002 or the technical helpline at 2886 6474, emailenquiry@judiciary.hk, or visit the Help Centre at 5/F, Wanchai Tower, 12 Harbour Road, Wan Chai.

Note: The iCMS application currently covers personal injury actions, tax claim proceedings, civil action proceedings and employees' compensation cases in the District Court, summons cases in the Magistrates' Courts, bulk claims in the Small Claims Tribunal, and selected case types of civil proceedings of the High Court, including civil appeal cases (CACV) in the Court of Appeal and commercial cases (HCCL), construction and arbitration cases (HCCT) and intellectual property cases (HCIP) in the Court of First Instance."
Speech by CE at Inauguration Ceremony of International Organization for Mediation (English only),2025-10-20 12:20,2025-10-20 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000351.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Inauguration Ceremony of the International Organization for Mediation today (October 20):

Honourable Vice Minister Hua Chunying (Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs), Your Excellencies, representatives of contracting states, ministers and officials from around the world, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. I am very honoured to join you today, for the inauguration of the International Organization for Mediation.

  I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to my country, China, for its steadfast support; and to the International Organization for Mediation's contracting states and signatory states, for their confidence in Hong Kong, as home to the Organization's headquarters.

  The headquarters is housed in this newly renovated building, a police station for almost a century. The renovation, completed within 14 months, harmoniously blends the building's historic origins with modern design, preserving architectural features, while drawing inspiration from Chinese porcelain.

  More than stone and mortar, this thoughtful transformation embodies the essential spirit of mediation – uniting diverse elements in balance and harmony, creating a place ideally suited for peaceful resolution.

  In these times of global instability, international mediation is indispensable for resolving disputes, preserving relationships and encouraging meaningful co-operation. With our world-class professional services, Hong Kong is dedicated to supporting the cause of dispute resolution.

  Under the unique ""one country, two systems""principle, Hong Kong enjoys both the China advantage and the global advantage. We pride ourselves with our established tradition of the rule of law, and a common law regime shared by many global financial hubs. Our three law schools are all ranked within the world's top 60, and nurture outstanding talent in legal and dispute resolution services.

  Our flagship legal event Hong Kong Legal Week, in December, will include a session on international mediation. And in 2026, during Hong Kong Mediation Week, we will organise a global mediation summit, bringing together mediation practitioners, policymakers and thought leaders from around the world.

  We are equally committed to capacity building. The Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy, launched last year by our Department of Justice, equips mediators and legal professionals with the skills to meet international standards.

  In my Policy Address last month, I announced the development of the Hong Kong International Legal Service Building, on a site adjacent to us here. It will provide additional facilities for the Organization, and be home to the International Legal Talents Training Academy.

  Ladies and gentlemen, today's inauguration is a testament of our shared commitment to a future in which dialogue, co-operation and mutual respect prevail over acrimony and conflict.

  As I said in May, at the signing of the convention establishing the Organization, Hong Kong builds bridges. We take pride in being a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"". And we are honoured to serve as the Organization's home.

  I am confident that, under the joint dedication of all contracting states and the SecretaryâGeneral's stewardship, the International Organization for Mediation will rise as a respected and trusted body for resolving disputes through mutual respect and understanding.

  I wish the International Organization for Mediation every success.

  Thank you."

Speech by SJ at opening ceremony of Legal Practical Training Course for Chinese Enterprises Going Overseas (English only),2025-10-20 11:48,2025-10-20 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000311.htm,"Following are the opening remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the opening ceremony of the Legal Practical Training Course for Chinese Enterprises Going Overseas today (October 20):

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is my great pleasure to welcome you all to this Legal Practical Training Course for Chinese Enterprises Going Overseas, organised by the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy of the Department of Justice of the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government.

First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council of the People's Republic of China (SASAC), especially the SASAC Bureau of Policies, Laws and Regulations for making this course a reality. With the strong support of SASAC, we have the privilege to convene 30 general counsel and senior legal officers from our country's leading state-owned enterprises under one roof. I understand we also invited three senior legal counsel from leading private companies. I also welcome colleagues from the Ministry of Commerce, who are with us here today. I extend my heartfelt thanks to each of you for taking the time to join us in Hong Kong for this course.

Traditionally, Hong Kong has been a springboard for Mainland enterprises to go global. This unique position is rooted in Hong Kong's status under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, making it the only bilingual common law jurisdiction in China where both Chinese and English are official languages. Such distinct advantages enable Hong Kong to act as a ""super connector"" and a significant value-adder between the Chinese Mainland and the rest of the world. Hong Kong continues to be the first stop for numerous Chinese companies establishing their overseas bases and seeking IPOs (initial public offerings). In the first half of 2025 alone, Hong Kong's IPO market raised an impressive HK$107.1 billion through 42 listings, marking a 700 per cent increase in funds raised and a 40 per cent rise in deal volume. This extraordinary performance positions Hong Kong as the top global fundraising hub, reinforcing its pivotal role as an international financial centre and a gateway for Chinese enterprises' global expansion.

As our country transforms from rapid growth to high-quality development, more and more outstanding Mainland enterprises are actively expanding to overseas markets. However, this new phase of global expansion also presents challenges. Chinese enterprises face increasing geopolitical uncertainties, diverse regulatory environments, and increasing compliance demands across different markets. Supply chain complexities and cost pressures continue to test operational resilience. Furthermore, adapting to local legal, cultural, and economic conditions remains critical for sustainable success.

Under these circumstances, the roles of legal counsel of enterprises have become more critical than a mere advisor or head of a legal division traditionally in the past. Nowadays, legal counsel often have to play the role as an architect of risk management framework, as a gatekeeper of compliance, and as a compass directing strategic decision-making for the enterprises or organisations as a whole. Legal counsel have to operate at the intersections of law, policy, and business, where your advice has direct implications on economic security and corporate reputation. This course is therefore profoundly important, as it aims to equip you with the cutting-edge knowledge and practical skills that will enable you to guide your enterprises or organisations towards sustained excellence and growth.

As announced in the Policy Address 2025 last month, the Chief Executive has highlighted the significant role of Hong Kong's legal services sector in supporting Mainland enterprises. Our Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Horace Cheung, is specifically tasked to promote Hong Kong's legal services and collaborate with other professional sectors, including accounting and finance, to provide robust support for Mainland enterprises aspiring to expand overseas. This course arrives at just the right time to take forward this very important initiative under the Policy Address.

We hope that this course could provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the current trends in overseas expansion, the evolving legal and regulatory challenges, the best practices for compliance and practical tools for navigating these complexities. We will delve into critical areas such as mergers and acquisitions, export control and sanctions, compliance, international commercial and investment arbitration, international trade instruments and regulations, transaction and dispute resolution involving sovereign states, intellectual property international strategies as well as hot topics such as stablecoins. In addition, we will have dedicated regional panels focusing on Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa respectively, where we invited 13 senior practitioners from 12 jurisdictions, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Vietnam to share their first-hand experience and local insights. I encourage you to actively interact with these panelists and share your experience with them, including any difficulties or challenges that you have faced or may face in these regions. We will also explore case studies to illustrate some critical legal and strategic issues.

We hope that by the end of this course, you will be well positioned to leverage Hong Kong's unique legal and dispute resolution advantages. We encourage you to make use of Hong Kong's robust legal infrastructure, wealth of expertise and world-class legal services as key resources to support and enhance your enterprises' overseas endeavours.

Beyond acquiring technical knowledge, this course also provides a unique opportunity to build and strengthen connections among peers facing similar challenges. We believe that, by sharing your insights and experiences with one another, you will be able to build a strong network that helps each of you grow professionally and enriches the collective wisdom that drives our success during times of uncertainty under the rapidly changing international landscape.

Before I end, I would like to take a moment to introduce the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy, which will soon be approaching its first anniversary. Since its launch last November, the Academy has co-organised a number of training programmes in Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and abroad, covering a variety of topics and targeting a wide spectrum of participants. Through organising practical legal courses, seminars and international exchange programmes, the Academy promotes international legal talent exchanges. This will help to consolidate Hong Kong's strategic position as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre in the Asia-Pacific region, establish Hong Kong as a capacity-building hub, and actively participate in the next decade of the Belt and Road Initiative, contributing to the country's efforts to promote the construction of the rule of law. I thank you all for your valuable support of the Academy thus far, and warmly encourage your continued engagement and collaboration with the Academy.

The Department of Justice will be hosting its annual flagship event, the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025, from December 1 to 5 this year. It is a fruitful week filled with opportunities to connect, learn, and engage with eminent legal minds from around the world. On December 1, the Academy will co-organise the 6th UNCITRAL Asia-Pacific Judicial Summit 2025 - Judicial Conference together with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). Themed ""Building towards End-to-End Digitalization"", this judicial conference will explore topics related to the application of digital economy, virtual assets, artificial intelligence and technology in the judicial field. On December 2, we will co-organise The Third Legal Forum on Interconnectivity and Development with the Commissioner's Office of China's Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong SAR. On December 3, the Academy will co-organise A Symposium of the HCCH Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific on Private International Law with the Hague Conference on Private International Law. Prominent international speakers such as the Secretary-General of international organisations and prominent overseas experts will be speaking at these events. They will certainly give you valuable insights and provide you with abundant opportunities to engage in meaningful discussions with these experts. You are warmly invited to participate in these events, as well as the other events focusing on dispute resolution, Greater Bay Area development and rule of law throughout the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025.

While you are in Hong Kong for this one-week course, I encourage you to take some time to explore the city. Beyond its status as the leading international legal and financial centre, Hong Kong is a vibrant city full of rich culture, delicious cuisine, and stunning sights. I hope you have the opportunity to experience the unique charm of this remarkable city alongside your learning journey.

In conclusion, I wish you all an engaging, insightful and productive experience in the coming week. I look forward to meeting you again during the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025. Thank you."

"Two co-owners fined over $130,000 for not complying with removal order",2025-10-20 11:00,2025-10-20 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000246.htm,"âTwo co-owners were convicted and fined $136,800 in total, of which $76,800 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued at the Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts last Friday (October 17) for failing to comply with a removal order issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap 123).

The case involved a four-storey unauthorised structure with an area of about 100 square metres on two lots in D.D.115, Yuen Long. Since the Lands Department would not issue a certificate of exemption for the unauthorised building works (UBWs) and the UBWs were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the co-owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, they were prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (October 20), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

Marking the first stop of the Orchestra's Asian tour this year, the two concerts present exceptional collaborations, featuring the celebrated Italian pianist Beatrice Rana, a rising star on the European and American classical music scene, who will make her Hong Kong debut to perform a Ravel work, and three of today's most acclaimed opera vocalists that will conclude the programme with a grand rendition of Act I of Wagner's ""Die Walküre"". This is an unmissable event for both classical music and opera lovers.

ããThe two concerts will open with the overture from Verdi's grand opera ""Les vÈpres siciliennes"". The first concert (November 20) will also feature pianist Rana, joining the Orchestra for a performance of Ravel's ""Piano Concerto in G"" - a work infused with jazz and Basque folk music elements that creates a rhythmically vibrant and entertaining dialogue between the piano and the orchestra. The evening will conclude with Rachmaninov's ""Symphony No. 2 in E minor, Op. 27"".

ããThe second concert (November 21) is dedicated to masterpieces by great opera composers, featuring the overtures from Rossini's ""William Tell"" and Verdi's ""La forza del destino"". The Orchestra will also present a concert version of Act I of Wagner's ""Die Walküre"" - the second installment of the ""Ring"" cycle, and the very piece that opened its current season. The performance boasts a stellar cast, with tenor Klaus Florian Vogt and soprano Miina-Liisa Värelä as the god Wotan's twins Siegmund and Sieglinde, and bass Kwangchul Youn portraying Sieglinde's husband Hunding. This concert version will be performed exclusively in Hong Kong during the Orchestra's Asian tour.

The Orchestra has collaborated with some of the greatest musicians and has been conducted by figures such as Mahler, Debussy, Richard Strauss, Stravinsky, Sibelius, Hindemith, Toscanini and more. It has performed in prestigious concert halls, such as the Berlin Philharmonie, Semperoper Dresden, and the Musikverein and Konzerthaus in Vienna.

屋宇署發言人今日（十月二十日）說：「僭建物可導致嚴重後果。業主必須盡快遵從清拆令。對於未有遵從清拆令的業主，屋宇署會繼續採取執法行動，包括提出檢控，以保障樓宇及公眾安全。」

兩場音樂會將以威爾第的大型歌劇《西西里晚禱》的序曲拉開帷幕。首場（十一月二十日）樂團另將與鋼琴家貝雅斯‧拉娜攜手演繹拉威爾的《G大調鋼琴協奏曲》，此曲受爵士音樂和巴斯克民樂風格影響，讓鋼琴與樂團來一場極富節奏感和娛樂性的對話。樂團亦以拉赫曼尼諾夫的《E小調第二交響曲，作品二十七》為該晚演出作結。

次場（十一月二十一日）的選曲均出自歌劇大師之作，包括羅西尼《威廉泰爾》和威爾第《命運之力》的序曲。樂團更將其今個樂季的開幕節目——華格納《指環》四部曲之二《女武神》第一幕的音樂會版本搬到香港演出，並由男高音克勞斯‧弗洛里安‧福茨、女高音米娜—莉莎‧瓦雷萊和男低音延侊哲分別聲演眾神之王伏坦的雙胞胎子女西格蒙和西格琳，以及西格琳的丈夫胡定。在是次亞洲巡演中，樂團僅在香港站上演此音樂會版本。

鋼琴家貝雅斯・拉娜於年僅18歲時已在蒙特利爾國際音樂比賽中奪得首獎及所有特別獎項，其後於二○一三范・克萊本國際鋼琴比賽中獲得銀獎及觀眾獎而廣受矚目。二○一五年與羅馬聖切契利亞管弦樂團合作錄製首張專輯，收錄浦羅歌菲夫《第二鋼琴協奏曲》和柴可夫斯基《第一鋼琴協奏曲》，獲得國際讚譽，並成為《留聲機》雜誌的編輯之選。二○一七年更榮獲《留聲機》雜誌「年度青年藝術家獎」。

米娜—莉莎・瓦雷萊被《歌劇雜誌》盛讚為「戲劇界女高音中最具潛力的新星之一」。她曾於杜達美指揮下與洛杉磯愛樂樂團合作，演繹華格納的《崔斯坦與伊索德》，今年更初登華格納歌劇年度盛事—拜羅伊特歌劇節，表現一鳴驚人。

克勞斯・弗洛里安・福茨憑其別樹一格的歌聲被譽為當代最傑出的華格納男高音之一，以華格納的《羅恩格林》中聖杯武士一角享譽國際，足跡遍及世界各大歌劇舞台，包括大都會歌劇院、皇家歌劇院、維也納國家歌劇院等。他更榮獲OPER! Awards 2025最佳男歌手奬項。

延侊哲是當今備受矚目的低音聲樂家之一，曾於多個國際歌劇舞台演出，包括巴黎歌劇院、維也納國家歌劇院和柏林國立歌劇院等。他於二○一八年獲柏林國立歌劇院授予「榮譽歌手」榮銜，同年獲頒湖巖藝術獎，確立其韓國國寶級演唱家的地位。

At the award presentation ceremony for the basketball competition, the Commissioner of Police, Mr Chow Yat-ming, expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Hong Kong Jockey Club and the Teens and Elderly Mission Committee for their support of this programme, as well as all participating teams for giving their best. He encouraged young people to develop teamwork skills through sports, and more importantly, to stay away from the temptation of drugs and illegal activities. He mentioned that the winning teams will engage in a series of volunteer services to contribute to society and will have the opportunity to visit the Mainland for competitions and exchange programmes. They will gain valuable experience of our country’s development and deepen their understanding of our country.

Youth are now growing up in an increasingly complex environment, shaped by rapid advancements in cyber technology and fraught with various temptations and traps, including the emerging drug etomidate and constantly evolving scam tactics. The success of youth crime prevention efforts is attributed to the sustained deepening of collaboration among all societal stakeholders and the Police. By combining insights and leveraging synergies, crime prevention messages and proper values can be instilled into the moral virtues of communities and young individuals, more broadly and profoundly.

Sponsored by the Hong Kong Jockey Club and launched in June, the JPC Anti-Narcotics and Fight Crime 3x3 Basketball Training Programme 2025 engaged nearly 6000 teachers and students from 66 secondary and primary schools. This year-long initiative delivers anti-drug and crime prevention messages through diverse activities, including basketball training and school talks, fostering positive mindsets among participants.

The basketball competition under the programme attracted 216 teams, comprising around 900 players from nearly 100 secondary and primary schools. The participating teams encompassed diverse ethnic backgrounds and included students from a Greater Bay Area school. Forty-eight elite teams progressed to today’s finals, vying for the championship, runner-up, and third-place positions in four men’s and four women’s divisions, along with accolades for Top Scorer and Most Valuable Player.

Today’s carnival featured 20 game booths on crime prevention themes, providing participants with opportunities to learn about the dangers of drug abuse and the latest scam tactics. The NSpeed National Security Express Promotional Truck was also on site, promoting national security awareness among the public through interactive displays."

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得41宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（十月十二日至十八日）廣東省新增2 086宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與上周（十月五日至十一日）的2 257宗有所下降。上周大部分個案（795宗）在江門市錄得，其次為佛山（241宗）、深圳（202宗）及廣州（189宗），全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：
• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：
• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-19 17:30,2025-10-19 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/19/P2025101900495.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 19), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 41 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 2 086 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (October 12 to 18), showing a decrease compared to the previous week, which reported 2 257 cases (October 5 to 11). Most of the cases (795 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen last week, followed by Foshan (241 cases), Shenzhen (202 cases) and Guangzhou (189 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

 
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

ââââ
  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

 Speaking at the opening ceremony, the Under Secretary for Security, Mr Michael Cheuk, thanked the various disciplined services, auxiliary services and mountaineering organisations for establishing a solid safety net for Hong Kong's outdoor activities. He especially reminded the public that when choosing to hike on dangerous terrain, any accident not only endangers the hiker but also puts rescuers at risk. Therefore, when participating in such high-risk activities, safety must be the primary consideration to ensure the safety of oneself and others.

  Mr Cheuk also stressed that, with the development of the lowâaltitude economy, the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), the Fire Services Department (FSD) and the CAS have been studying the use of drones for efficient search and rescue operations. This not only improves rescue efficiency but also reduces the risk to rescuers.

  Then, Mr Cheuk presented certificates of completion to those who had finished the Mountain Casualty Handling Course as well as the Hiking Safety and Mountain Rescue Course.

 The Chief Staff Officer of the CAS, Mr Leung Kwun-hong, also expressed his gratitude to various government departments and organisations for their joint efforts in promoting mountain safety and ensuring the safety of citizens. He said that the FSD, the HKPF, and the Government Flying Service (GFS) have always been important partners of the CAS in mountain search and rescue operations. They have fought side by side with the CAS, successfully rescuing trapped persons and demonstrating a high level of professionalism and selfless dedication.

 Other attending guests included the Director of Operations of the HKPF, Mr Lui Kam-ho; the Deputy Director of Fire Services (Operations), Mr Derek Chan; and the Controller of GFS, Mr Eddie Liu, as well as representatives from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, the Office of the Communications Authority, the Hong Kong Observatory, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, the Auxiliary Medical Service, the Lands Department, and various mountaineering organisations.

 The promotion day featured booth games designed to raise awareness about mountain activity safety. It also showcased a variety of mountain activity equipment and demonstrated techniques for mountain search and rescue as well as handling injured individuals, allowing the public to gain a better understanding of the work involved in mountain rescue operations.

  A special highlight of the event was the opportunity for citizens to take photos with working dogs from the various disciplined forces, sharing a fun experience together."

保安局副局長卓孝業在開幕禮致辭時，感謝各部隊及山嶺機構為香港山野活動建立了穩固的安全網。他特別提醒市民，當選擇在地勢險要的山徑行山時，一旦發生意外，除了自身面臨危險外，也會將救援人員置於險境。因此，參與這類高風險活動時，必須以安全為首要考慮，確保自己及他人的安全。

卓孝業亦強調，隨着低空經濟的發展，香港警務處、消防處和民安隊已積極研究利用無人機進行高效搜救。除了提升救援效率，更減少了救援人員的風險。

其後，卓孝業頒發結業證書予完成「山嶺傷者處理課程」及「登山安全及攀山搶救課程」的學員。

Award Presentation Ceremony of Hong Kong Excellent Family Awards held today (with photos),2025-10-19 16:57,2025-10-19 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/19/P2025101900453.htm,"The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) hosted the Award Presentation Ceremony of the Hong Kong Excellent Family Awards today (October 19) to recognise 15 winning families and promote good family values and traditional virtues to the community and the younger generations. The Deputy Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, and the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, officiated at the ceremony.

In his speech, Mr Cheuk noted that China's long-standing culture and society have always emphasised family harmony and valued good family values and virtues. As President Xi Jinping said, ""The family is the basic cell of society. Family harmony leads to social stability. Family happiness creates social harmony."" The National 14th Five-Year Plan clearly states the need to strengthen family building. The Law of the People's Republic of China on Family Education Promotion, implemented by the State in 2022, elevates family education from a ""family matter"" to a ""national matter,"" fully reflecting our country's focus on family education and the promotion of the fine Chinese traditions. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has been actively responding to national policies, and strives to promote the building of a family-friendly society and the healthy development of families in Hong Kong.

Miss Mak expressed her gratitude to the general public for their active participation and support by sharing their family life and insights on nurturing family relationships. She noted that each participant's story is unique, which allows the others to deeply appreciate the family values and virtues of excellent families. She hoped that the event would facilitate the passing down of genuine bonds of family to the next generation, highlighting the significance of family.

She said, ""Hong Kong is our big family. Harmony in the family will bring prosperity for all. Family harmony is not only the source of personal happiness, but also a vital foundation for social prosperity and steady progress. I look forward to continuing to work hand in hand with everyone to enhance society's recognition of family values and promote positive family values and virtues.""

The HYAB and Family Council co-organised the Hong Kong Excellent Family Awards in April this year. The event is open to all Hong Kong citizens. With the focus on ""Fostering Stable Family Relationships for Building Good Family Values and Virtues"", the event promotes the importance of good family values and passing down good family traditions and virtues to the community and the younger generations by recognising families that show mutual respect, care, love and support for one another.

The adjudication panel, comprising community representatives as well as representatives from the HYAB and the Family Council, have selected 15 winning families after careful assessment and deliberation. These included 10 recipients of the ""Excellent Families Award"" and five recipients of the ""Passage of Good Family Values and Virtues Award"". At the Award Presentation Ceremony, the winning families shared their experiences and insights on fostering strong family relationships, promoting positive family culture and values, as well as fine family traditions and virtues to the public."

卓永興致辭時表示，中國源遠流長的文化和社會一直重視家庭和諧，珍視良好家教家風。正如習近平主席說：「家庭是社會的細胞。家庭和睦則社會安定，家庭幸福則社會祥和。」國家《十四五規劃綱要》明確提出要加強家庭建設。國家在二○二二年實施的《家庭教育促進法》，更將家庭教育由「家事」提升為「國事」，充分體現國家對家庭教育和弘揚中華民族優良傳統的重視。特區政府一直積極響應國家政策，致力推動家庭友善社會的建設及香港家庭的健康發展。

麥美娟感謝市民的踴躍參與及支持，分享他們與家人的點滴及維繫家庭關係的心得。她表示，參加者的故事每一個都獨一無二，讓人深刻體會到美好家庭的家教家風。她期望，活動能讓真摯的親情傳承給下一代，彰顯家庭的意義。

她說: 「香港就是我們共同的大家庭。家和萬事興，家庭和睦，不僅是個人幸福的源泉，更是社會繁榮、穩步向前的重要根基。我期待與各位繼續攜手同行，共同增進社會對家庭價值的認同，宣揚優良的家教與家風。」

頒獎典禮的其他主禮嘉賓包括四位全港美好家庭選舉評審委員會的委員，分別為立法會主席梁君彥、香港社福界心連心大行動副主席譚贛蘭教授、家庭議會主席彭韻僖和家庭議會家庭核心價值及家庭教育推廣小組委員會召集人羅輝，以及民青局副局長梁宏正。

民青局及家庭議會於今年四月舉辦全港美好家庭選舉，公開邀請全港市民報名參與。活動以「建立穩固家庭關係樹立良好家教家風」為重點，藉以表揚相敬相愛、互相關懷支持的家庭，向社會及年輕一代宣揚良好的家庭價值和傳承良好家風與美德。活動反應熱烈，吸引約1 200個家庭報名參加。由社會人士、民青局代表及家庭議會代表組成的評審委員會經過仔細評審後，選出15個得獎家庭，分別為10個「美好家庭獎」和五個「良好家教家風傳承獎」。得獎家庭在頒獎典禮上分享他們維繫良好家庭關係的經驗和心得，向市民大眾推廣積極正面的家庭文化及價值觀，以及優良的家風和傳統美德。"

梁君彥主席（立法會主席）、譚贛蘭教授（香港社福界心連心大行動副主席）、彭韻僖主席（家庭議會主席）、陳清霞主席（婦女事務委員會主席）、各位家庭議會及婦女事務委員會成員、各位立法會議員、各位校長、各位同學、各位爺爺嫲嫲、公公婆婆和乖孫、乖仔、乖女：

​大家好！今天很多家庭幾代同堂一起參與這個活動，首先感謝大家出席全港美好家庭選舉頒獎典禮，一同分享得獎家庭的喜悅，為他們所展現的家庭凝聚力點讚。

​​和諧的家庭是社會穩定的基石。正如政務司副司長剛才提到，特區政府一直重視香港家庭的健康發展。民青局與家庭議會一直緊密合作，透過多項活動，提倡重視家庭，推廣家庭核心價值，營造關愛和睦的社會氛圍。

​​今年，我們推出全港美好家庭選舉，希望向社會大眾進一步宣揚良好家庭價值，加強家庭、家教、家風的建設工作。我很高興這項目收到接近1 200個家庭參加，我們由衷感謝各位市民、各位朋友的踴躍參與及支持，大家都無私和慷慨地分享他們與家人的生活點滴。

​​在仔細閱覽所有故事的過程中，我們深受感動，每一個家庭的故事都獨一無二，充滿真情實感，這讓我們深刻體會到美好家庭的樣貌多元而豐富，遠非單一標準所能衡量。這些故事告訴我們，美好家庭不一定要由驚天動地的故事來定義。一份真摯的親情、一套傳承給下一代的家庭傳統，往往更能彰顯家庭的意義。正因所有參賽家庭都如此優秀，令評審工作變得十分艱難。我在看大家的參賽作品時一直在想，幸好我不用當評審，否則很難決定結果，所以辛苦了梁主席、譚教授、彭主席和羅輝先生（家庭議會轄下家庭核心價值及家庭教育推廣小組委員會召集人）為我們擔任評審。在這個艱難的評審工作完成後，經過仔細遴選，並邀請了入圍家庭會面，最終評選出10個「美好家庭獎」和五個「良好家教家風傳承獎」的得主。

​​我代表民青局，特別感謝立法會主席梁君彥議員、香港社福界心連心大行動副主席譚贛蘭教授、家庭議會主席彭韻僖女士，以及家庭議會轄下家庭核心價值及家庭教育推廣小組委員會召集人羅輝先生。各位在百忙中撥冗，與民青局的代表一齊擔任評審。我知道很多入圍家庭對能夠跟你們親身會面都感到雀躍。我聽同事說，有些來面試的家庭表示獲獎與否不要緊，獲獎當然開心，不獲獎也不要緊，因為可以見到大主席，平時只能夠在電視機見到大主席。多謝大主席為我們擔任評審工作。今日各位親臨頒獎典禮現場，表揚得獎家庭，非常感謝各位。

​​同時，我要感謝海洋公園、黃廷方慈善基金及信和集團對這個項目的鼎力支持，贊助這個項目的獎品，並派出代表今日到場支持得獎家庭；也要感謝團體協助宣傳，讓更多家庭關注這個項目。正是透過政、商、民三方的緊密合作，這項富有意義的活動得以順利完成。

​​我衷心祝賀在座每個得獎家庭。你們每一份參賽作品，我都有細閱。雖然大家背景各異、經歷不同，但每個故事都充分詮釋了香港美好家庭的核心精神——無論是彌足珍貴的跨代支持與家風傳承，還是小家庭的溫馨日常，抑或是面對逆境時的堅毅同行，都充滿溫度與力量，觸動人心。我們期盼，這些真實的故事能喚起社會對家庭的珍視，讓感恩與擔當成為構建家庭幸福和諧的堅實橋樑。

​​在座每一位都有美滿的家庭。而香港就是我們共同的大家庭。家和萬事興，家庭和睦，不僅是個人幸福的源泉，更是社會繁榮、穩步向前的重要根基。我期待與各位繼續攜手同行，共同增進社會對家庭價值的認同，宣揚優良的家教與家風。

在此我提一個重要日子，今天領獎的日子固然重要，接下來很快有一個很重要的日子，就是十二月七日的立法會選舉。如果大家和我們一樣，都是希望社會能夠充滿關愛，家庭能夠得到支持，希望大家記得屆時用你們重要的一票，發揮家庭的力量，全家總動員參與立法會選舉，選出一個支持香港發展的立法會議員。

最後，祝願在座各位家庭幸福，家和萬事興，多謝大家。"

梁君彥主席（立法會主席暨全港美好家庭選舉評審委員會主席）、麥美娟局長（民政及青年事務局局長）、譚贛蘭教授（香港社福界心連心大行動副主席暨全港美好家庭選舉評審委員會委員）、彭韻僖主席（家庭議會主席暨全港美好家庭選舉評審委員會委員）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今日很高興出席由民政及青年事務局（民青局）和家庭議會合辦的全港美好家庭選舉頒獎典禮，與各位一同見證香港美好家庭精神的典範。

中國源遠流長的文化和社會一直重視家庭和諧，珍視良好家教家風。正如習近平主席說：「家庭是社會的細胞。家庭和睦則社會安定，家庭幸福則社會祥和。」家庭的健康與國家和民族的前途命運緊密相連。國家《十四五規劃綱要》明確提出要加強家庭建設，推動家庭服務多元化發展，並充分發揮家教、家風在基層社會治理中的積極作用。國家在二○二二年實施的《家庭教育促進法》，更將家庭教育由「家事」提升為「國事」，充分體現國家對家庭教育和弘揚中華民族優良傳統的重視。

特區政府一直積極響應國家政策，致力推動家庭友善社會的建設及香港家庭的健康發展。特區政府於二○○七年成立家庭議會，作為跨界別及跨政策局的平台，向市民推廣關愛家庭的文化，並確立了三組家庭核心價值，即愛與關懷、責任與尊重及溝通與和諧，為社會注入和諧的原動力。

為了進一步深化家庭、家教及家風的建設工作，本屆政府在二○二四年十月推出了為期五年的家庭教育推廣計劃，每年撥款800萬元，資助民間推行家庭教育項目。計劃首年反應熱烈，共收到逾200個申請，反映社會對家庭教育的廣泛關注。

此外，政府於去年十月舉辦首屆香港家庭暨婦女發展高峰會（高峰會），吸引了超過900名本地及粵港澳大灣區婦女團體、商界和相關服務組織的代表參與。民青局將會在二○二六年一月舉辦第二屆高峰會，與各界代表一同探討持續推動本港家庭和婦女發展的措施。

全港美好家庭選舉是行政長官在《2024年施政報告》中提出推動家庭發展的措施，藉以弘揚家庭價值。項目於今年四月啟動，以建立穩固家庭關係樹立良好家教家風為重點，透過參賽家庭分享他們的動人故事，向市民大眾傳遞溫暖、互助、傳承美德的家庭力量。市民的反應踴躍，有接近1 200個家庭提交參賽作品。1 200個家庭的故事，有些是關於一同克服逆境，有些是關於日常確幸，參賽家庭有新來港家庭，也有幾代同堂的大家庭。

我衷心祝賀所有得奬家庭。你們的故事詮釋了甚麼是風雨同舟、休戚與共，什麼是舐犢情深、春暉寸草，生動體現了孝親敬老、夫妻和睦、團結互助的中華傳統美德，為全港家庭樹立了良好榜樣。透過你們的經歷，我感受到家庭關係越牢固，越能夠應對生活上各種挑戰。我相信民青局和家庭議會一定會繼續透過不同方式及平台傳播這些故事，將優良家風薪火相傳，培育對國家和家庭有承擔的年輕一代。

家庭不僅是社會的基本細胞，更是我們心靈的港灣。家庭的幸福需要政府、社會各界與每一位市民同心共建。讓我們同心同行，以關愛成就每個美好的家庭，共築和諧穩定的社會。

  To our English-speaking guests and friends, a very warm welcome to you. It is a great pleasure to join you here for the Award Presentation Ceremony of the Hong Kong Excellent Family Awards, an initiative co-organised by the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau and the Family Council. Today, we are not just gathering here to present awards to the winners but to celebrate the very foundation of a harmonious society - the enduring bonds of love and care within families. By generously sharing your experiences, you inspire the wider community to uphold family values and the sanctity of family bonds.

  May the love and traditional virtues we celebrate today ripple outwards, touching every heart in this city. Let us all be builders of close and happy families, architects of harmonious and benevolent communities, and creators of a brighter tomorrow for Hong Kong.

  Thank you, and I wish you all a remarkable celebration today."

政務司副司長出席全港美好家庭選舉頒獎典禮致辭,2025-10-19 15:05,2025-10-19 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/19/P2025101700587.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（十月十九日）出席全港美好家庭選舉頒獎典禮的致辭：

梁君彥主席（立法會主席暨全港美好家庭選舉評審委員會主席）、麥美娟局長（民政及青年事務局局長）、譚贛蘭教授（香港社福界心連心大行動副主席暨全港美好家庭選舉評審委員會委員）、彭韻僖主席（家庭議會主席暨全港美好家庭選舉評審委員會委員）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今日很高興出席由民政及青年事務局（民青局）和家庭議會合辦的全港美好家庭選舉頒獎典禮，與各位一同見證香港美好家庭精神的典範。

中國源遠流長的文化和社會一直重視家庭和諧，珍視良好家教家風。正如習近平主席說：「家庭是社會的細胞。家庭和睦則社會安定，家庭幸福則社會祥和。」家庭的健康與國家和民族的前途命運緊密相連。國家《十四五規劃綱要》明確提出要加強家庭建設，推動家庭服務多元化發展，並充分發揮家教、家風在基層社會治理中的積極作用。國家在二○二二年實施的《家庭教育促進法》，更將家庭教育由「家事」提升為「國事」，充分體現國家對家庭教育和弘揚中華民族優良傳統的重視。

特區政府一直積極響應國家政策，致力推動家庭友善社會的建設及香港家庭的健康發展。特區政府於二○○七年成立家庭議會，作為跨界別及跨政策局的平台，向市民推廣關愛家庭的文化，並確立了三組家庭核心價值，即愛與關懷、責任與尊重及溝通與和諧，為社會注入和諧的原動力。

為了進一步深化家庭、家教及家風的建設工作，本屆政府在二○二四年十月推出了為期五年的家庭教育推廣計劃，每年撥款800萬元，資助民間推行家庭教育項目。計劃首年反應熱烈，共收到逾200個申請，反映社會對家庭教育的廣泛關注。

此外，政府於去年十月舉辦首屆香港家庭暨婦女發展高峰會（高峰會），吸引了超過900名本地及粵港澳大灣區婦女團體、商界和相關服務組織的代表參與。民青局將會在二○二六年一月舉辦第二屆高峰會，與各界代表一同探討持續推動本港家庭和婦女發展的措施。

全港美好家庭選舉是行政長官在《2024年施政報告》中提出推動家庭發展的措施，藉以弘揚家庭價值。項目於今年四月啟動，以建立穩固家庭關係樹立良好家教家風為重點，透過參賽家庭分享他們的動人故事，向市民大眾傳遞溫暖、互助、傳承美德的家庭力量。市民的反應踴躍，有接近1 200個家庭提交參賽作品。1 200個家庭的故事，有些是關於一同克服逆境，有些是關於日常確幸，參賽家庭有新來港家庭，也有幾代同堂的大家庭。

我衷心祝賀所有得奬家庭。你們的故事詮釋了甚麼是風雨同舟、休戚與共，什麼是舐犢情深、春暉寸草，生動體現了孝親敬老、夫妻和睦、團結互助的中華傳統美德，為全港家庭樹立了良好榜樣。透過你們的經歷，我感受到家庭關係越牢固，越能夠應對生活上各種挑戰。我相信民青局和家庭議會一定會繼續透過不同方式及平台傳播這些故事，將優良家風薪火相傳，培育對國家和家庭有承擔的年輕一代。

家庭不僅是社會的基本細胞，更是我們心靈的港灣。家庭的幸福需要政府、社會各界與每一位市民同心共建。讓我們同心同行，以關愛成就每個美好的家庭，共築和諧穩定的社會。

Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected cannabis buds at airport (with photos),2025-10-19 15:00,2025-10-19 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/19/P2025101900297.htm,"Hong Kong Customs yesterday (October 18) detected two drug trafficking cases involving baggage concealment at Hong Kong International Airport and seized a total of about 26 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with a total estimated market value of about $5.2 million. Two persons were arrested.

In the first case, a 27-year-old female passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers foundabout 15.5kg of suspected cannabis buds with an estimated market value of about $3.1 million, in her check-in baggage. She was subsequently arrested.

In the second case, a 26-year-old female passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, on the same day. During customs clearance, Customs officers found about 10.5kg of suspected cannabis buds with an estimated market value of about $2.1 million, in her check-in baggage. She was subsequently arrested.

Investigations of the two cases are ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
香港海關於機場檢獲懷疑大麻花（附圖）,2025-10-19 15:00,2025-10-19 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/19/P2025101900298.htm,"香港海關昨日（十月十八日）在香港國際機場偵破兩宗行李藏毒的販毒案件，共檢獲約二十六公斤懷疑大麻花，估計市值共約五百二十萬元。兩名人士被捕。

在首宗案件中，一名二十七歲的女旅客昨日從泰國曼谷飛抵本港。海關人員替她進行清關時，在其寄艙行李內發現重約十五點五公斤懷疑大麻花，估計市值約三百一十萬元，遂把該名女子拘捕。

在第二宗案件中，一名二十六歲的女旅客同日從泰國曼谷飛抵本港。海關人員替她進行清關時，在其寄艙行李內發現重約十點五公斤懷疑大麻花，估計市值約二百一十萬元，遂把該名女子拘捕。

兩宗案件仍在調查中。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。

海關會繼續根據風險管理的原則，重點揀選來自高風險地區的旅客作清關檢查，確保有效打擊跨境販毒活動。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑販毒活動。
