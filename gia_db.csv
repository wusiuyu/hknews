The CHP reminded the public to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent foodborne diseases.

The two clusters involved four males and four females aged between 3 and 69. They developed diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting and fever about 10 to 29 hours after consuming takeaway scallop fried rice and poon choi purchased from a branch of the Café de Coral located at the Shop N95, 1/F (Ptn B), 1-17 Mount Sterling Mall, Mei Foo Sun Chuen, on December 21.

  The seven affected persons sought medical advice and one of them required hospitalisation. That person's stool specimen tested positive for Salmonella bacteria.All of the affected individuals are currently in stable condition.
 
Officers of the CHP and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (including personnel of the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch) conducted a joint investigation at the restaurant. They examined the handling processes and food hygiene, and collected food and environmental samples for testing. A preliminary investigation revealed that the food concerned has a risk of cross contamination in the handling process. The CFS immediately instructed the premises concerned to stop selling the incriminated food items, and carry out cleaning and disinfection of premises. The officers have also provided health education related to food safety and environmental hygiene to the staff of the premises.

  The investigation of the CHP and the CFS is ongoing.

  ""Members of the public are reminded to maintain food and environmental hygiene, which is the key to preventing food poisoning. During the festive season, some may choose to order takeaway poon choi for gatherings. The public should pay attention to the key points of food safety when consuming poon choi. Chilled poon choi should be kept at four degrees Celsius or below. And don't collect the poon choi too early. It is best to collect it half an hour to one hour before consumption. When collecting and transporting poon choi, make sure it is kept at above 60 degrees C. Before consuming poon choi, it should be reheated thoroughly till the core temperature reaches at least 75 degrees C,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

The exhibition leads visitors to explore the literary and military achievements in the life of the formidable hero Cao Cao. The exhibition traces the discovery, excavation and verification of Cao Cao's tomb to unveil the mystery and reveal the true character of Cao Cao. Admission is free.

Cao Cao (155-220 AD) was an outstanding politician, military strategist and poet during the late Eastern Han dynasty. He laid the foundation for the establishment of the Wei state and profoundly influenced the historical trajectory of the Three Kingdoms period. In 2009, Cao Cao's tomb was discovered in Anyang, Henan Province, followed by intense debate over the authenticity of the tomb. The academic community has now confirmed Xigaoxue Tomb in Anyang as the Mausoleum of Cao Cao, and the layout of the cemetery, the burial structure and the remains and various artefacts found in the tomb form a complete chain of evidence.

Incorporating replicas of excavated artefacts and drawing upon the research of Chair Professor of Humanities at the Southern University of Science and Technology, and former researcher at the Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Professor Tang Jigen, the exhibition reveals the true character of the formidable hero Cao Cao, while offering a glimpse into the social and political landscape of the late Eastern Han dynasty. In addition to panels for children and videos, visitors can explore Cao Cao's multifaceted personality through an interactive rotating cube installation that showcases well-known anecdotes. There is also a photo spot where visitors can savour the grandeur of Cao Cao's literary and military achievements.

The exhibition is organised by the CCPO, and supported by the Hong Kong Museum of History. For details of the exhibition, please visit the website: www.ccpo.gov.hk/en/programme/archaeology-of-cao-cao-exhibition.​"

受影響的四男四女年齡介乎3歲至69歲。他們分別於十二月二十一日在位於美孚新邨萬事達廣場1-17號1字樓N95鋪B部分的大家樂分店購買外賣帶子炒飯及盆菜，食用後10至29小時先後出現腹瀉、腹痛、嘔吐和發燒等病徵。

七名受影響人士已求醫，其中一人須留院治理，其大便樣本驗出沙門氏菌。全部受影響人士現時情況穩定。

衞生防護中心和食物環境衞生署人員（包括食物安全中心和環境衞生部人員）已到涉事食物業處所調查，檢視食物烹調流程和衞生，並抽取食物及環境樣本作化驗。初步調查顯示有關食物在處理過程中存在交叉污染的風險。食物安全中心已即時指示有關處所暫停供應涉事食物、清潔消毒處所，及向餐廳員工提供食物安全和環境衞生教育。

衞生防護中心和食物安全中心的調查仍然繼續。

衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒：「市民應保持食物和環境衞生，預防食物中毒。節日聚會期間，不少人會選擇訂購盆菜回家享用，市民應留意盆菜食物安全要點。經冷凍處理的盆菜應保持在攝氏四度或以下；不要過早提取盆菜，於食用前半小時至一小時為合適，並於提取和運送盆菜時確保盆菜保持在攝氏60度以上，在食用前須將食物徹底翻熱至中心溫度達攝氏75度或以上。」

市民可到衞生防護中心和食物安全中心網頁參考健康享用盆菜的錦囊和製造盆菜的安全指引。

要預防經由食物傳播的疾病，市民應經常保持個人、食物及環境衞生。在外進食時，應注意以下要點：

Two incoming passengers convicted and jailed for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2025-12-30 18:00,2025-12-30 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000583.htm,"​Two incoming male passengers were sentenced to six months' imprisonment with a fine of $1,000, and three months' imprisonment with a fine of $1,000 respectively by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (December 30) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted an incoming male passenger, aged 27, at Hong Kong International Airport on November 16. About 58 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $237,700 and a duty potential of about $191,700 were seized from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to six months' imprisonment with a fine of $1,000 today.

As well, Customs officers intercepted another incoming male passenger, aged 42, at the airport on the abovementioned date. About 19 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $77,900 and a duty potential of about $62,800 were seized from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to three months' imprisonment with a fine of $1,000 today.

Customs welcomes the sentences. The custodial sentences have imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflect the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
​兩名入境旅客進口未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-12-30 18:00,2025-12-30 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000582.htm,"兩名入境男旅客因進口未完稅香煙及未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（十二月三十日）在西九龍裁判法院各被判處監禁六個月及罰款一千元，和監禁三個月及罰款一千元。

海關人員於十一月十六日在香港國際機場截查一名二十七歲的抵港男旅客，並在他攜帶的個人行李內檢獲約五萬八千支未完稅香煙，估計市值約二十三萬七千七百元，應課稅值約十九萬一千七百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。他今日被判處監禁六個月及罰款一千元。

另外，海關人員在上述日子於機場截查一名四十二歲的抵港男旅客，並在他攜帶的個人行李內檢獲約一萬九千支未完稅香煙，估計市值約七萬七千九百元，應課稅值約六萬二千八百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。他今日被判處監禁三個月及罰款一千元。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
FSTB issues progress update on work of Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime and related disciplinary investigation,2025-12-30 17:42,2025-12-30 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000523.htm,"The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) today (December 30) issued a progress update on the report of the Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime and the disciplinary investigation of the incident on procurement of bottled drinking water. An FSTB spokesman said that subsequent to the announcement and implementation of a series of quick-win measures in October to strengthen protection against fraudulent acts, the Task Force chaired by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, has been exploring further enhancement measures and has completed its review on the existing government procurement regime. The disciplinary investigation of the incident on procurement of bottled drinking water was also completed recently. The Government is studying the investigation report and consulting the Department of Justice to determine suitable disciplinary actions to be taken. Relevant results will be announced as soon as possible and are expected to be ready next month. The results will then be announced together with the Task Force report to conclude the incident.

Furthermore, the Government Logistics Department launched an open tender today for the contract to supply bottled drinking water to government offices on Hong Kong Island and parts of the outlying islands. Following new guidelines promulgated this October, this tender exercise has strengthened relevant requirements at various stages, including preparation of tender documents, tender evaluation and contract management, to help procurement officers guard against fraudulent acts more effectively and to select a supplier competent to ensure a stable supply of bottled drinking water in accordance with contract terms."
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-30 17:31,2025-12-30 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000567.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 30), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
-----------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10 of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

  
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-12-30 17:30,2025-12-30 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000563.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月三十日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————
本港今年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自十二月十日確診一宗於十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

New sections of GreenWay in Kai Tak open today (with photos),2025-12-30 16:28,2025-12-30 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000235.htm,"​Two new sections of the GreenWay in the Kai Tak Development Area for shared use by pedestrians and cyclists are open to the public today (December 30). The newly opened sections, each approximately 400 metres in length, are located at Kai Tak Promenade, as well as Shing Kai Road Garden and Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) Dining Cove (please refer to the location map).

The newly opened sections are situated alongside Victoria Harbour and the KTSP, offering users scenic views of the harbour and promoting integration with the KTSP, as well as enhancing the connectivity of open spaces in the area. With the opening of the two sections, the about two-kilometre GreenWay on the western side of the runway area, extending from Shing Kai Road Garden via KTSP Dining Cove to Kai Tak Promenade,overlooking Victoria Harbour,has been fully connected, with accessibility and connectivity significantly enhanced. To date, about 4.3 kilometres of the GreenWay within the Kai Tak Development Area are open.

  Same as the GreenWay sections already opened, the newly opened sections have ground markings, signs and speed-reducing rumble strips in place to ensure safe use for both pedestrians and cyclists. Moreover, bicycle parking spaces are available, and there is a barrier-free walkway running alongside the GreenWay for pedestrians, offering an additional option for the public. At the initial stage after the opening, ambassadors will be present at the GreenWay to provide appropriate reminders to users. Furthermore, the KTSP will flexibly manage the opening hours of the GreenWay at the Dining Cove and implement crowd control measures as necessary, having regard to the events taking place in the KTSP.

The GreenWay in Kai Tak has a total length of about 13 kilometres. Following the about 4.3 kilometres already opened, the remaining sections are expected to be implemented and opened progressively from 2026 onwards to dovetail with government and private development projects in the area.

HA to consult District Councils about clearance and rehousing arrangements for redevelopment of Sai Wan Estate and Phase 1 of Ma Tau Wai Estate,2025-12-30 16:05,2025-12-30 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000448.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Housing Authority:

  The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) announced today (December 30) thatit will respectively consult the Central and Western District Council and the Kowloon City District Council next month about the clearance and rehousing arrangements for the redevelopment of Sai Wan Estate (SWE) and Phase 1 of Ma Tau Wai Estate (MTWE).

  ""The HA conducts assessments on aged public rental housing (PRH) estates from time to time in order to ensure the buildings are in a safe condition and suitable for accommodating residents. The actual circumstances will also be considered in a prudent manner when deciding whether to redevelop a PRH estate,"" a spokesman for the HA said.

  The HA has reserved adequate rehousing resources for the affected tenants for the clearance and rehousing proposals of the two aforementioned PRH estates. The proposed clearance and rehousing of SWE can be carried out under a single phase in 2029 so that all affected tenants will be rehoused to Phase 1 of the Ka Wai Man Road public housing development (Annex I) nearby in one go. With the thoughtful arrangements by the project team, this proposal will allow all affected tenants to move into the new estate together with their neighbours, maintaining warm neighbourhood relationships and continuing the sense of community. There are currently 636 flats in SWE. It is expected that the number of flats will increase by 460 to about 1 100 flats after the redevelopment to cater for more residents in need.

  As for the MTWE redevelopment, in consideration of the unanimous views of the residents and the community that the clearance and rehousing arrangement should be expedited, the HA proposes using part of the new Mei Tung Estate public housing development as additional rehousing resources on top of the reception estate at To Kwa Wan Road public housing development so that the phases of redevelopment can be reduced from three to two, thereby significantly shortening the rehousing period for all MTWE residents from 14 years to seven years. The clearance in Phase 1 will cover Geranium House and Narcissus House and the rehousing of the affected tenants is anticipated to commence in 2028. The clearance and rehousing for Phase 2 will be announced in due course (Annex II). After the redevelopment of the entire estate, the number of flats in MTWE is expected to increase from more than 2 000 to about 4 000 flats, providing over 2 000 additional units for residents in need.

  In addition, the HA also proposes offering domestic tenants affected by the clearance a domestic removal allowance to help meet part of their moving expenses. Eligible one-person and two-person households, regardless of age, may also opt to receive a cash allowance in lieu of rehousing to a PRH unit as an alternative option to suit their needs. For example, elderly persons may move into residential care homes for the elderly, settle in the Chinese Mainland, or live with their children, etc. Furthermore, the HA also proposes to accord priority to affected tenants of HA's announced clearance projects who would like to purchase subsidised sale flats (SSFs) in lieu of PRH in flat selection over other applicants in the SSFs sale exercise(s) launched before the target clearance date.

  The HA will establish an on-site Community Service Team in SWE and MTWE to help maintain effective communication with the affected households, especially the elderly, to provide help and fully assist them in vacating their existing flats and adapting to their new living environment throughout the project."
房委會就西環邨和馬頭圍邨（第一期）重建清拆及遷置建議方案諮詢區議會,2025-12-30 16:05,2025-12-30 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000287.htm,"下稿代香港房屋委員會發出：

香港房屋委員會（房委會）今日（十二月三十日）宣布，下月會分別就西環邨和馬頭圍邨（第一期）的清拆及遷置建議方案諮詢中西區區議會及九龍城區議會。

房委會發言人說：「房委會定期為高樓齡公共屋邨進行評估，確保樓宇狀況安全和適合居民居住，並會按實際情況審慎考慮是否重建個別屋邨。」

就上述兩個屋邨的清拆及遷置建議方案，房委會已為受影響住戶預留足夠的遷置資源，其中西環邨的清拆及搬遷建議更可於二○二九年一次過進行，讓所有受影響住戶可以同時遷到鄰近的加惠民道第一期公營房屋發展項目（附件一）。經過團隊的細心安排，這個方案可以讓街坊鄰里一同搬遷，保留原來屋邨的人情溫暖及延續對社區的歸屬感。西環邨現時有636個單位，預計經重建後更可以增加460個單位至約1 100個，給更多有需要的居民入住。

就馬頭圍邨重建計劃，考慮到居民和各界均希望清拆及搬遷時間能加快步伐，房委會建議在土瓜灣道公營房屋發展項目以外，加入部分新美東邨公營房屋發展項目作為遷置資源，令重建期數由三期縮減至兩期，搬遷所有居民的時間亦由十四年大幅縮減至七年。第一期清拆範圍包括洋葵樓及水仙樓，預計受影響住戶可於二○二八年進行搬遷。第二期的清拆及搬遷時間則會適時公布（附件二）。馬頭圍邨現時有超過2 000個單位，整個屋邨重建後可以增至約4 000個單位，大幅增加了2 000多個單位給更多有需要的居民入住。

另外房委會建議，受清拆影響住戶可獲發放住戶搬遷津貼，以協助他們支付部分搬遷開支。合資格單身人士和二人家庭不論年紀亦可選擇領取「替代配屋津貼」，以代替入住公屋的選擇，藉此給予住戶多一個選項以切合他們的需要，例如一些長者可改往長者院舍、內地定居或與子女共住等。此外，房委會亦建議，所有受房委會已公布公屋清拆計劃影響的住戶如欲購買資助出售單位以代替入住公屋，可選購在目標清空日期前推出的資助出售單位，並可較其他申請者優先選樓。

房委會會為西環邨和馬頭圍邨成立駐邨社區服務隊與受影響住戶保持有效溝通，尤其是長者，並為他們提供服務，全程協助他們遷離現居單位及適應新居住環境等。"

政府公布本港第二份病毒性肝炎行動計劃以邁向消除病毒性肝炎公共衞生威脅的目標　將推出乙型肝炎篩查先導計劃（附圖）,2025-12-30 15:35,2025-12-30 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000427.htm,"政府今日（十二月三十日）公布《2025-2030年香港病毒性肝炎行動計劃》（《2025-2030行動計劃》），進一步落實一系列預防及控制病毒性肝炎的策略和工作，包括推出以風險為本的乙型肝炎篩查，以減少病毒性肝炎的傳播及降低患病和死亡數字，特別是由病毒性肝炎引起的肝癌新症和死亡案例，並達致世界衞生組織（世衞）訂下於「二○三○年或之前消除病毒性肝炎帶來公共衞生威脅」的全球目標。

根據香港癌症資料統計中心資料，肝癌是香港第三大致命癌症，於二○二三年，共有1 408人死於肝癌，佔癌症死亡總數的9.5%，而肝細胞癌病例中，超過70%與乙型肝炎相關。

政府一直非常關注病毒性肝炎帶來的公共衞生威脅。由衞生署署長及醫院管理局（醫管局）行政總裁擔任聯席主席的預防及控制病毒性肝炎督導委員會（督導委員會）早於二○二○年底推出《2020-2024年香港病毒性肝炎行動計劃》（《2020-2024行動計劃》）。

過去五年，政府已全面落實《2020-2024行動計劃》內各項措施和行動方案，並取得階段性成果。透過推出新措施，包括為乙型肝炎病毒量高的孕婦提供抗病毒藥物治療及為高風險嬰兒進行乙型肝炎疫苗接種後的血清測試，香港於二○二四年只有0.2%兒童經由患有乙型肝炎的母親感染乙型肝炎病毒，遠低於措施實施前約1%的母嬰傳播率。

督導委員會仔細審視計劃成效和國際最新發展後，明確訂出未來五年需落實的具體行動，除了衞生署和醫管局外，基層醫療署和更多相關機構會加入參與計劃，以期達致更全面的覆蓋，產生更強的協同效應。

消除病毒性肝炎的主要挑戰在於本地存在大量未確診或未接受治療的乙型肝炎患者。根據估計，香港約有41萬人感染乙型肝炎，其中40%未有察覺自己患有慢性乙型肝炎，70%則未有接受適當跟進治療。《2025-2030行動計劃》將透過下列四大核心策略，強化病毒性肝炎防控工作：

（一）提升認知：加強與地區康健中心及其他社區持份者的協作，充分發揮各組織優勢互補，提升公眾、目標群組及醫護人員對病毒性肝炎的認知水平，從而支援乙型肝炎篩查與治理；

（二）追蹤應對：更新本地指標，強化現有病毒性肝炎監測機制，更密切地監測和評估消除病毒性肝炎的進展。監測系統將會支援由數據導向的政策制訂，為規劃精準有效措施提供依據，並為驗證衞生部門應對措施的成效提供數據支援；

（三）預防感染：乙型肝炎的主要傳播途徑是母嬰傳播，這亦是病毒在香港流行的主要原因。因此，持續預防乙型肝炎母嬰傳播是消除乙型肝炎新感染個案的關鍵，包括為孕婦進行乙型肝炎篩查及為新生嬰兒接種乙型肝炎疫苗、使用抗病毒藥物來預防母嬰傳播，及為高風險嬰兒安排疫苗接種後的血清測試。其他預防策略包括預防醫療相關的乙型和丙型肝炎病毒傳播，以及降低關鍵人群（如注射毒品人士和男男性接觸者）的感染風險和疾病負擔；以及

（四）擴展診療：為逐步擴展乙型肝炎篩查的規模，政府將推出篩查服務，資助高風險群組進行篩查。同時將發展基層醫療為本的共治模式，以提升治理乙型肝炎的能力。

基層醫療署將推出「慢性疾病共同治理平台」，除涵蓋「三高」（高血壓、高血糖和高血脂）外，亦以試點形式推行以風險為本的乙型肝炎篩查及管理。針對在一九八八年（即初生嬰兒普及乙型肝炎疫苗注射計劃之推出年份）或以前出生，其家庭成員（包括父母、兄弟姐妹及子女）或性伴侶為慢性乙型肝炎患者，以及沒有確診患有慢性乙型肝炎且無相關症狀病徵的香港居民。如參加者確診患有慢性乙型肝炎，可獲資助診症、資助的藥物治療及肝臟超聲波服務，定期進行肝癌監測，以配合落實《2025-2030行動計劃》中，增加香港乙型肝炎的診斷和治療覆蓋率。乙型肝炎篩查細節會於明年初公布。期望新措施有助於及早在社區識別慢性乙型肝炎患者並及時跟進和治理，從而減低患上乙型肝炎併發症（如肝硬化和肝癌）的風險，並減少相關患病和死亡數字。基層醫療署將於二○二六年初進一步公布推行細節並展開相關服務。

政府預期在二○三○年或之前就四大範疇達到一系列的成果，詳情請見附件。

"Government promulgates Hong Kong's second viral hepatitis action plan covering rollout of pilot hepatitis B screening programme, to progress towards goal of eliminating public health threat posed by viral hepatitis (with photo)",2025-12-30 15:35,2025-12-30 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000430.htm,"The Government today (December 30) announced the Hong Kong Viral Hepatitis Action Plan2025-2030(Action Plan 2025-2030), which sets out strategies to further strengthen the prevention and control of viral hepatitis by a series of initiatives, including the introduction of a new risk-based hepatitis B screening programme. These initiatives aim to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis and lower related morbidity and mortality, especially new cases and deaths of liver cancer attributable to viral hepatitis. The goal is to eliminate the public health threat posed by viral hepatitis by 2030, in line with the World Health Organization's global goal. 

According to data from the Hong Kong Cancer Registry, liver cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer deaths in Hong Kong. In 2023, there were 1 408 liver cancer deaths, accounting for 9.5 per cent of all cancer deaths. Over 70 per cent of hepatocellular carcinoma cases were associated with hepatitis B.

The Government has attached great importance to the public health threat posed by viral hepatitis. As early as late 2020, the Steering Committee on Prevention and Control of Viral Hepatitis (Steering Committee), co-chaired by the Director of Health and the Chief Executive of the Hospital Authority (HA), formulated the Hong Kong Viral Hepatitis Action Plan 2020-2024 (Action Plan 2020-2024).

  Over the past five years, the Government has fully implemented all measures outlined in the Action Plan 2020-2024, achieving substantial progress. Through the introduction of new initiatives, including providing antiviral treatment for pregnant women with high hepatitis B virus (HBV) viral loads and arranging serologic testing after hepatitis B vaccination for high-risk infants, the rate of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HBV in Hong Kong dropped to 0.2 per cent in 2024, which is well below the pre-intervention level of approximately 1 per cent.

After carefully reviewing the effectiveness of the action plan and the latest international developments, the Steering Committee has clearly set out specific actions to be implemented in the next five years. In addition to the Department of Health (DH) and the HA, the Action Plan 2025-2030 also incorporates the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) and other relevant organisations for more comprehensive coverage and stronger synergy.

The major challenge in eliminating viral hepatitis lies in the substantial number of the undiagnosed or untreated local population with hepatitis B. It is estimated that approximately 410 000 people in Hong Kong have hepatitis B. Among them, 40 per cent are unaware of their condition and 70 per cent are not receiving appropriate medical follow-up. The Action Plan 2025-2030 strengthens efforts to prevent and control viral hepatitis along the following four strategic axes:

(1) Heightening awareness: The collaborative partnerships and engagement with District Health Centres and other community stakeholders will be strengthened, leveraging the complementary strengths of each organisation to raise awareness among the general population, target populations and healthcare professionals. This will support viral hepatitis screening and management in the community;

(2) Tracking health sector response: The set of local indicators will be updated to enhance the existing surveillance on viral hepatitis, allowing for closer monitoring and evaluation of progress towards viral hepatitis elimination targets. The surveillance system will support data-driven policy formulation by providing a basis for developing specific and effective measures, and offering data to validate the effectiveness of the health sector's response;

(3) Preventing new infections: The primary transmission route for HBV is MTCT, which drives the prevalence of HBV in Hong Kong. Therefore, sustained prevention of MTCT of HBV is crucial for eliminating new HBV infections. This includes hepatitis B screening for pregnant women, neonatal hepatitis B vaccination, using antivirals to prevent MTCT of HBV and arranging post-vaccination serologic testing for high-risk infants. Other prevention strategies include preventing healthcare-related transmission of HBV and hepatitis C virus and reducing the risk and disease burden among key populations, such as people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men; and

(4) Expanding access to screening, care and treatment: To gradually scale up hepatitis B screening in Hong Kong, the Government will launch a screening service subsidising groups at increased risk of HBV infection. A shared care model supported by primary care will also be developed to build up capacity for hepatitis B management.

The PHC Commission will launch a Chronic Disease Co-care Platform. In addition to covering the ""three highs"" (high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high cholesterol), the platform will introduce risk-based hepatitis B screening and management on a pilot basis. It targets Hong Kong residents born in or before 1988 (that is the year of the introduction of universal childhood hepatitis B immunisation programme) whose family members (including parents, siblings and offspring) or sexual partners have contracted chronic hepatitis B, and residents who have no known medical history of chronic hepatitis B nor related symptoms. If a participant is diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B through the platform, he/she will receive subsidised medical consultations, medication and liver ultrasonography services, and undergo regular liver cancer surveillance. This aligns with the implementation of the Action Plan 2025-2030, which seeks to increase the diagnosis and treatment coverage of hepatitis B in Hong Kong. Details of the hepatitis B screening will be announced early next year. The new measures are expected to promote the early identification of people with chronic hepatitis B in the community and provide timely follow-ups and treatment, thereby reducing the risks of complications (such as cirrhosis and liver cancer) and lowering related morbidity and mortality rates. The PHC Commission will further announce the implementation details and introduce related services in early 2026.

The Government expects to reach a number of key milestones for each of the four strategic axes by 2030. Details are set out in the Annex.

Retail banks fully launch Money Safe,2025-12-30 14:30,2025-12-30 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000208.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) announced today (December 30) that all retail banks (including digital banks) will have fully launched the Money Safe service for individual customers by or before December 31, and will embark on a series of publicity campaigns.

Money Safe is like setting up a safe within a bank account. Bank customers can specify the amount of deposits to be protected. When customers need to use the protected deposits, banks will conduct a face-to-face anti-scam verification with the customers, thus offering them a chance to carefully consider whether they have been scammed. Customers can transfer or withdraw the deposits only after completing the process.

Money Safe is suitable for all customer segments. For members of the public with bank deposits that they do not need to use in the near term, they may consider putting them under Money Safe protection. The HKMA will actively promote Money Safe in collaboration with the banking industry, including launching advertisements and various promotional campaigns, to help the public understand and make good use of this new service.

Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA Mr Arthur Yuensaid, ""Money Safe provides an additional layer of protection for deposits and is a highly useful anti-scam tool. Strengthening bank customers' ability to protect themselves is a crucial part of our anti-scam efforts. The HKMA will continue to collaborate with the banking sector, law enforcement agencies, and stakeholders to combat scams from all fronts. I urge the public to make full use of Money Safe while always remaining vigilant to prevent scams.""

The Acting Chairperson of HKAB,Ms Rose Kay, said, ""Enhancing customer protection is one of the HKAB's priorities this year. With all retail banks fully launching Money Safe, the banking industry will intensify the promotion to encourage wider adoption of Money Safe. The banking industry will continuously strengthen various anti-fraud measures and public education, joining hands with the HKMA and law enforcement agencies to combat scams."""
​零售銀行全面推出「智安存」,2025-12-30 14:30,2025-12-30 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000209.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）與香港銀行公會（銀行公會）今日（十二月三十日）公布，所有零售銀行（包括數字銀行）於十二月三十一日或之前全面向個人客戶推出「智安存」服務，並將展開一系列宣傳計劃。

「智安存」猶如在銀行戶口內設置夾萬，銀行客戶可自行設定受保護的存款金額。當客戶需要動用受保護存款時，銀行會與客戶進行面對面的反詐騙核實程序，讓客戶有機會想清楚是否被騙，完成程序後客戶才可轉出或提取有關存款。

「智安存」適合所有客戶群使用，如市民有一些短期內不需動用的銀行存款，可考慮為這些存款加上「智安存」保護。金管局將聯同銀行業界積極宣傳「智安存」，包括推出廣告及各項推廣計劃，幫助市民了解並善用新服務。

金管局副總裁阮國恒表示：「『智安存』為存款多加一層保護，是一項非常有用的防騙工具。增強銀行客戶自我保護的能力是防騙工作中重要的一環。金管局會繼續與銀行業界、執法機關和各持份者合作，全方位打擊騙案。我呼籲市民積極使用『智安存』，同時要時刻保持警惕，慎防騙案。」

銀行公會署理主席紀鷺禧表示：「加強客戶保障是銀行公會今年的重點工作之一。隨着所有零售銀行全面推出『智安存』，銀行業界將加強推廣『智安存』，令『智安存』更普及。銀行業界會持續提升各種防騙措施和公眾教育，與金管局和執法機關攜手打擊詐騙罪行。」"

東涌第122區用地原為政府就私人興建資助出售房屋先導計劃（又名「樂建居」）選取作招標的其中一幅政府用地。用地現交由房協發展為旗下資助出售房屋項目，初步預計可於二○三一至三二年度提供約1 600個資助出售單位。

房屋局發言人表示：「政府一直根據社會需求和實際情況，務實調整不同用地的發展安排。房協是政府在房屋政策上的重要合作夥伴，在發展資助出售房屋方面有豐富經驗。經檢視最新情況，政府認為把東涌第122區用地交由房協發展，能更快促成資助出售房屋的落成。」

政府於二○二三年六月公布「樂建居」的政策框架，旨在善用市場力量，提高整體發展容量。政府目前正密切留意市場發展，檢討是否需要按市場情況適度調整「樂建居」的部分主要參數，以及未來其他「樂建居」用地的招標安排，並會適時公布。

發言人補充說：「將東涌第122區用地交由房協興建資助出售房屋，與政府增加資助出售單位供應、協助基層置業及鼓勵上進上流的政策目標一致，相信市民會樂見其成。政府亦會繼續推進其他有關完善房屋階梯的措施，讓市民置業安居。」"

Further announcements will be made in due course.

Patients may book an appointment either through the telephone appointment system or the ""Book FMC"" function of the ""HA Go"" mobile app.

The spokesperson reminded members of the public to stay vigilant to personal and environmental hygiene during the public holiday to avoid spreading diseases. Members of the public who develop respiratory symptoms should wear a mask and seek medical advice promptly. The HA appeals to non-emergency patients to avoid using accident and emergency (A&E) services and seek treatment at FMCs, private doctors or 24-hour outpatient services at private hospitals to reduce pressure on public hospital A&Es. Members of the public can visit the Health Bureau's (HHB) Primary Care Directory (www.pcdirectory.gov.hk) to choose a family doctor and view related clinic service information. The HHB has also collated information of private hospitals, healthcare facilities, family doctors and Chinese medicine clinics that will be in operation during the New Year holiday across the city. The information (including addresses, phone numbers and operation hours) of the relevant hospitals and clinics has been uploaded to the online portal (www.map.gov.hk/gm/s/hhbclinic/all?lg=en) for public reference in collaboration with the Spatial Data Office of the Development Bureau and the Lands Department.

Meanwhile, the spokesperson appeals to members of the public, especially high-risk groups, to get vaccinated early for seasonal influenza and COVID-19 to reduce the chance of infection for themselves and their family members, as well as to reduce critical cases and deaths.

DH's GCMTI publishes Hong Kong Chinese Materia Medica Standards Volume 12,2025-12-30 12:00,2025-12-30 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000251.htm,"​The Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute (GCMTI) of the Department of Health (DH) today (December 30) published the safety and quality standards for 13 commonly used Chinese Materia Medica (CMM) in Volume 12 of the Hong Kong Chinese Materia Medica Standards (HKCMMS), bringing the total number of CMM covered by the HKCMMS to 357. The HKCMMS serves as a reference for the public and the trade.

""The 13 newly added CMM include Agastaches Herba, Ailanthi Cortex, Akebiae Caulis, Angelicae Dahuricae Radix, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Campsis Flos, Chrysanthemi Flos, Olibanum, Panacis Majoris Rhizoma, Paridis Rhizoma, Sinomenii Caulis, Uncariae Ramulus cum Uncis and Vladimiriae Radix. As a well established market for CMM, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region places great emphasis on their quality and safety. The DH launched the HKCMMS project in 2002 to establish reliable, comprehensive and internationally recognised reference standards for commonly used CMM. These standards serve as a reference for the Chinese medicine sector and laboratories in verifying the authenticity of CMM, thereby ensuring their quality and safety, and facilitating trade in Chinese medicine. Thanks to the increasingly comprehensive coverage of CMM in the HKCMMS, its application has expanded across multiple segments of the Chinese medicine industry, including the wholesale and retail of Chinese herbal medicines, as well as quality control in the manufacturing of proprietary Chinese medicines,"" the Assistant Director of Health (Chinese Medicine), Dr Edmund Fong, said.

 He added that the HKCMMS project is co-ordinated by the GCMTI. The GCMTI's building, which commenced phased operations on December 11,houses specialised laboratories and advanced testing equipment, strengthening the technical support for HKCMMS development. The new International Collaboration and Training Centre will offer high-quality venues for HKCMMS-related meetings, training, and technology transfer activities, facilitating the promotion of the HKCMMS at local, regional, and international levels.

The HKCMMS sets out the names, sources, descriptions of the CMM, as well as methods of identification (including microscopic identification, thin-layer chromatographic identification, gas and high-performance/ultra high-performance liquid chromatographic fingerprinting), tests, extractives and assays. The criteria for selecting the CMM for research include the following:

*common usage in the local community;
* international concern in respect of their safety and quality;
* high economic value in the local market; and
* priority being accorded to the CMMs listed in Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 of the Chinese Medicine Ordinance.

The research for HKCMMS Volume 12 was conducted by universities and research institutions from Hong Kong, and the Chinese Mainland. An international advisory board comprising local, Chinese Mainland and overseas experts also advised on the research principles, methodologies, parameters and analytical methods of the HKCMMS. The Government Laboratory developed analytical methods for determining heavy metals, pesticide residues and mycotoxins, and participated in interlaboratory verification. In addition, the National Medical Products Administration, the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission provided valuable advice and support to the HKCMMS project.

The DH will continue its effort in publicity and training to actively promote the practical application of the HKCMMS, such as arranging briefing sessions for the Chinese medicines trade as well as representatives of laboratories to update them on HKCMMS Volume 12 and the latest research developments of the HKCMMS project.

All Volumes of the HKCMMS have been uploaded to the website of the Chinese Medicine Regulatory Office of the DH for public access."

Interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements releases latest information and appeals to public and visitors to plan cross-boundary trips early during New Year holidays,2025-12-30 11:50,2025-12-30 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000286.htm,"  The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, released the following information today (December 30) on the traffic and public transport arrangements during the New Year holidays.

  From January 1 to 4, in anticipation of a large number of members of the public, visitors and cross-boundary vehicles visiting various land-based boundary control points (BCPs), the Transport Department (TD) urged cross-boundary travellers to use public transport services between Hong Kong and the Mainland or Macao, plan their trips early and allow sufficient travelling time. The TD has been steering local and cross-boundary public transport operators (PTOs) to strengthen their services during the New Year holidays to meet passenger demand, including:

Early morning of New Year's Day

(1) Lo Wu Control Point (passenger clearance services to be extended to 2am on New Year's Day)

The operating hours of the MTR East Rail Line will be extended correspondingly, with the last departure from Admiralty to Lo Wu extended to 0.56am;


(2) Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port (LMC/HG Port) (24-hour operations as usual)

Travellers may take the MTR East Rail Line or other public transport services to Sheung Shui, interchange with franchised bus route No. N73 to Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange, and then transfer to the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) to the Mainland;
PTOs will also strengthen the LMC/HG Port short-haul cross-boundary coach and the Yellow Bus services to cater for the peak passenger demand;


(3) Shenzhen Bay Port (SBP) (passenger and passenger vehicle clearance services to provide 24-hour operations)

Franchised bus operators will operate two special overnight bus routes, Nos. NB2 and NB3, to provide services to and from Yuen Long/Tin Shui Wai and Tuen Mun respectively during the overnight period. Travellers may also take the MTR Tuen Ma Line to Yuen Long/Tin Shui Wai and Tuen Mun Stations, and interchange with route Nos. NB2 and NB3 to SBP respectively;
The governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong have also allocated special cross-boundary coach quotas for the operation of overnight services; and


(4) Hong Kong Port of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) (24-hour operations as usual)

The frequency of the HZMB shuttle bus (Gold Bus) will be increased, if needed.


New Year's Day daytime and long weekend of Mainland (January 1 to 4)


BCP shuttle bus services will be strengthened, including increasing the frequencies of the Gold Bus and the Yellow Bus to cater for passenger demand;
Cross-boundary coach services will be strengthened, including allocating additional cross-boundary coach quotas and enhancing the LMC/HG Port short-haul cross-boundary coach services;
The frequency of local franchised bus B routes connecting various land-based BCPs will also be increased to a level higher than that of normal weekends, and the operators will reserve sufficient vehicles and manpower to meet passenger demand; and
The train services of the MTR East Rail Line between Admiralty and Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau will be enhanced at different times during the above period to provide convenience for the travelling public and visitors.


Travel outside peak periods

  The TD anticipates that the waiting time for public transport services, including the Gold Bus and the local franchised bus B routes, may be longer during peak periods of cross-boundary travel. Passengers should avoid travelling during peak hours, observe order while queuing and heed advice from on-site police and PTO staff. Passengers planning to take cross-boundary coaches are also advised to reserve their coach tickets in advance.

  Of note, motorists of cross-boundary private cars crossing the border are advised that, subject to actual traffic conditions, special traffic arrangements may be implemented at the Lok Ma Chau and the Shenzhen Bay Port during New Year holidays to secure smooth access for public transport vehicles to the above BCPs. Cross-boundary private cars may experience longer waiting times when crossing the BCPs during the peak periods. Motorists should pay extra attention to variable message signs and traffic signs along the roads. In case of traffic congestion, they should remain patient and follow the instructions of on-site police.

Information dissemination

  For the HZMB, to plan their journeys ahead, members of the public can make use of the TD's HKeMobility mobile app or website (hkemobility.gov.hk/en/traffic-information/live/cctv) to access snapshots of traffic conditions at inbound and outbound vehicle plazas of the HZMB Hong Kong Port. They can also check real-time situations of the vehicle clearance plaza of the Zhuhai Port through the WeChat official accounts ""hzmbzhport"" or ""zhuhaifabu"" (traffic-info.gzazhka.com:5015/#/) (Chinese only). Moreover, motorists are reminded to always comply with the traffic control measures implemented by the Zhuhai authority when driving on the HZMB Main Bridge. Vehicles must not occupy the emergency lane unless instructed by the Zhuhai authority.

  Residents and visitors may visit ""Easy Boundary"" (www.sb.gov.hk/eng/bwt/status.html?type=outbound), a one-stop information platform on immigration clearance launched by the Security Bureau, or the HKeMobility to obtain useful information, including the respective average waiting time for passengers and private cars at land-based BCPs, as well as for the Gold Bus and Yellow Bus to plan their trips and save waiting time. Members of the public are advised to check the latest traffic news through radio and television broadcasts, the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk) and the HKeMobility.

  The TD's Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre operates round the clock to closely monitor the traffic conditions and public transport services of various districts, the BCPs and major stations, and to implement contingency measures when necessary to meet service demands.

  The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements is tasked with holistically co-ordinating and steering the preparatory work of various government departments for welcoming visitors to Hong Kong during the New Year's Eve and New Year holidays, as well as strengthening information dissemination to enable the public and visitors to plan their itineraries according to the latest situation."
中東呼吸綜合症最新情況,2025-12-30 11:30,2025-12-30 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000255.htm,"世界衞生組織（世衞）近日報告在中東地區在過去半年新增九宗中東呼吸綜合症個案，主要集中在沙特阿拉伯，顯示中東呼吸綜合症仍不時在中東出現。衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月三十日）呼籲市民到訪中東地區時應提高警覺，避免接觸單峰駱駝。

根據世衞的資料，上述新增個案涉及九名成年人士，而今年截至十二月二十一日，全球共錄得19宗中東呼吸綜合症個案，包括四宗死亡。全部個案在中東受到感染（當中大部分在沙特阿拉伯），部分個案已知有接觸過單峰駱駝或到訪動物市場。

世衞維持對沙特中東呼吸綜合症整體風險的評估，並預計在中東及其他有該病毒在單峰駱駝之間流行的國家，仍會繼續錄得中東呼吸綜合症個案。中心會繼續與世衞及相關衞生當局密切聯繫，以監察中東呼吸綜合症的活躍情況及趨勢。

本地方面，中東呼吸綜合症是法定須呈報傳染病，香港至今沒有發現人類感染個案。入境旅客及市民如最近曾到訪中東地區，並於14日內出現發燒或下呼吸道病徵，會被列為中東呼吸綜合症懷疑個案處理，並送往公立醫院接受隔離治療，直至其樣本對中東呼吸綜合症冠狀病毒呈陰性反應為止。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「科學證據顯示，單峰駱駝屬中東呼吸綜合症冠狀病毒的宿主。感染中東呼吸綜合症冠狀病毒的單峰駱駝或不會出現任何感染病徵。中東呼吸綜合症冠狀病毒可透過受感染動物的鼻及眼分泌、糞便，甚或奶及尿液傳播。該病毒亦可存在於受感染動物的生內臟及生肉之中。在中東地區呈報的個案中，大部分病人均曾接觸單峰駱駝、飲用駱駝奶，或曾接觸已確診中東呼吸綜合症的病人。我們建議營辦中東團的旅行社，不應安排旅客騎單峰駱駝或參與任何直接接觸單峰駱駝的活動。這些均屬感染中東呼吸綜合症冠狀病毒的已知風險因素。另外，到當地旅遊的人士應避免到有單峰駱駝的農場、農莊或市場，亦應避免接觸病人及動物，特別是單峰駱駝。」

他續說：「長期病患如糖尿病、慢性肺病、慢性腎病及免疫力疾病等病人，一旦感染中東呼吸綜合症冠狀病毒，較易出現嚴重併發症。前往中東的市民（特別是前往麥加的信徒）應於出發前徵詢醫護人員的意見，以評估風險及是否適宜前往。前往麥加的信徒可參閱衞生署的建議。朝覲人士如返港後兩星期內有身體不適，應佩戴外科口罩，立即求診並告訴醫生近期的外遊紀錄。」

​市民可參閱衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務中東呼吸綜合症專頁、中東呼吸綜合症受影響地區統計數字、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁及YouTube頻道，以及世衞最新消息，了解更多資料及健康建議。接待團友到外地旅遊的領隊及導遊應參閱中心就對中東呼吸綜合症的健康須知。"
Update on latest MERS situation,2025-12-30 11:30,2025-12-30 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000254.htm,"​The World Health Organization (WHO) recently reported nine new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in the Middle East regions over the past six months, which primarily occurred in Saudi Arabia. This indicated that MERS continued to emerge sporadically in the regions. The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (December 30) appealed to the public to remain vigilant and avoid contact with dromedary camels when visiting Middle East regions.

According to the WHO, the new cases involved nine adults. As of December 21 this year, a total of 19 MERS cases have been recorded globally, including four fatal cases. All cases were infected in the Middle East (mostly in Saudi Arabia), with some cases having known exposure to dromedary camels or visits to animal markets.

The WHO maintains its overall risk assessment of MERS in Saudi Arabia and expects that more cases of MERS will be reported in the Middle East or other countries where the virus circulates among dromedary camels. The CHP will continue to maintain close communication with the WHO and relevant health authorities to monitor the activity and trends of MERS.

  Locally, MERS is a statutorily notifiable infectious disease and no human cases have been recorded so far in Hong Kong. Inbound travellers and members of the public who recently visited the Middle East regions and developed fever or lower respiratory symptoms within 14 days will be classified as suspected MERS cases. They will be admitted to public hospitals for isolation and management until their specimens test negative for MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

  ""Scientific evidence shows that dromedary camels are reservoirs for MERS-CoV. Dromedary camels infected with MERS-CoV may not show any signs of infection. Infected animals may shed MERS-CoV through their nasal and eye discharge and faeces, and potentially in their milk and urine. The virus can also be found in the raw offal and meat of infected animals. Among the reported cases in the Middle East regions, most of the patients had been in contact with dromedary camels, consumed camel milk, or had contact with patients who had been diagnosed with MERS. We recommend travel agents organising tours to the Middle East to refrain from arranging for visitors to ridedromedary camels or to participate in any activities involving direct contact with dromedarycamels, which are known risk factors for acquiring MERS-CoV. Moreover, travellers to the regions should avoid visiting farms, barns or markets where there are dromedary camels, as well as contact with patients and animals, especially dromedary camels,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

  ""Those with pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, chronic lung disease, chronic renal disease and immunodeficiency, are more likely to develop severe complications if they are infected with MERS-CoV. Members of the public travelling to the Middle East (particularly pilgrims travelling to Mecca) should consult healthcare providers before they travel to review the risks and assess whether a pilgrimage is advisable. Pilgrims visiting Mecca may refer to the DH'sadvice. If pilgrims feel unwell during the two weeks after returning to Hong Kong, they should wear a surgical mask, seek medical attention immediately and inform a doctor of their recent travel history,"" he added.

The public may visit the MERS page of theCHPand itsTravel Health Serviceto learn more aboutMERS statistics inaffected areas. The public should also refer tothe CHP'sFacebook pageandYouTube channeland the WHO'slatest newsfor more information and health advice. Tour leaders and tour guides operating overseas tours are advised to refer to the CHP'shealth advice on MERS."
