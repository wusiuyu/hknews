Government continues to follow up on support and relief work and investigations on Tai Po fire,2025-12-01 00:56,2025-12-01 01:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/01/P2025120100011.htm,"A Government spokesman said yesterday (November 30) that the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements, led respectively by the Chief Secretary for Administration, the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, and the Deputy Financial Secretary, are making every effort to press ahead with the support and relief work and investigations on the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po.

The Government has been offering an emergency cash subsidy of $10,000 per affected household since November 27 evening to provide immediate relief for affected residents. As at 1pm yesterday, the Government has registered more than 1 900 households for the subsidy and disbursed the emergency cash subsidies to 1 420 households. In addition, the Government will provide a token of solidarity of $200,000 to the family members of each deceased victim, and a living allowance of $50,000 will be provided to each affected household starting this week.

For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po established by the Government, as at noon yesterday, the donations received have reached $900 million, apart from the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, bringing the fund's total to around $1.2 billion. The fund will be used for assisting the residents in rebuilding homes and providing long-term and persistent support.

As well, the supplies donation online platform established by the Government and the information technology sector began operation yesterday (www.taipodonation.hk) to facilitate registration of supplies donations from organisations and members of the public, enabling the Government to better consolidate information and distribute supplies to residents in need as necessary. The Government has also set up a central supplies station at the Tai Po Community Centre to co-ordinate and properly manage the donated materials received.

On emergency accommodation support, as of this morning, 683 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels/camps or hotel rooms. Another 1 144 residents have moved into transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or the Housing Society. Furthermore, two shelters remain open for residents in need.

All units in the transitional housing projects are equipped with basic facilities including an individual bathroom with toilet as well as a cooking area. Subject to the size of the projects, different facilities, such as laundry rooms and convenience stores, are also available. Members of the public in need may call the Task Force on Transitional Housing of the Housing Bureau at 3611 8482 to obtain more information about the admission of different projects. Accommodation is free of charge. Pets are also welcome.

To provide further convenience for victims admitted into transitional housing, starting from today (December 1), the first departure of the residents' service connecting Good House in Tai Po and the MTR Tai Po Market Station will be advanced to 7.30am departing from Good House Monday to Friday.

As of this morning, social workers of the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with about 1 300 affected households, and 3 200 affected residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" support service. Social workers will maintain liaison with the affected households, and those not yet in touch with the SWD are advised to leave their contact information by calling 182 183 as soon as possible.

In view of affected residents gradually relocating from temporary shelters to various communities, the Primary Healthcare Commission will leverage the District Health Centres (DHCs)/DHC Expresses as hubs to provide personalised case management services to residents affected by the incident, and co-ordinate healthcare professionals from various disciplines to provide medical, nursing and medication services, as well as psychological support. Those affected may also visit the Hospital Authority's Family Medicine Clinics for services, and will later be able to make priority bookings through the system. In addition, the medical stations currently set up at temporary shelters will remain in operation.

As for funeral-related matters, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will arrange dedicated staff to assist each family of the deceased, enabling them to make arrangements at their preferred time and location. The Government will waive fees for columbarium and related services, and provide $50,000 to the families of each deceased individual through the ""one social worker per household"" service to cover funeral and related expenses. The FEHD has set up a service counter at the Fu Shan Public Mortuary and will proactively contact the families to offer assistance. Once the families have made decisions regarding their preferred arrangements, the FEHD will follow up promptly.

For the latest updates and information about the support services, please visit the Government's one-stop dedicated website: www.taipofire.gov.hk.

Following the completion of inspection on the overall structural safety of Wang Yan House, Wang Tao House and the first two floors of Wang Cheong House on November 29, the Independent Checking Unit of the Housing Bureau (ICU), together with more than 100 professionals from the Housing Department, further completed the inspections of Wang Kin House, Wang Tai House, Wang Shing House and Wang Chi House as at 5pm yesterday. More than 1 500 units in total have been inspected in these two days. The inspection of Wang Sun House and Wang Cheong House has also commenced. The Police have arranged sufficient manpower to remain on standby. Once the safety of the remaining two buildings is confirmed, the Police will immediately deploy officers to conduct searches inside.

According to the initial assessment of the professionals, there is no imminent danger in terms of the overall structural safety of the buildings inspected, but the structure of some units may be subject to more serious damage. The Housing Bureau has already engaged contractors for emergency maintenance to complete the relevant support works as soon as possible in order to allow officers of the Police Force and the Fire Services Department (FSD) to enter the units for evidence and other operations.

Regarding the handling of reported missing persons, the Police completed searches at two buildings on November 29 and deployed more than 600 officers from the Disaster Victim Identification Unit to conduct searches in three other buildings yesterday. As of 4pm yesterday, the Police handled 30 sets of human remains in the buildings, including 12 sets found by firefighters but yet to be removed, and 18 sets that were newly discovered. The numbers of deceased and injured have been updated to 146 and 79 respectively. The Police will continue to follow up on the alleged missing persons, aiming to confirm their status and the number of casualties as soon as possible. The FSD also handled all the 347 assistance calls received during the fire.

The Police have accorded top priority to the case and are gathering evidence through various channels for a thorough and in-depth investigation.

The Housing Bureau also noted that, with Prestige Construction & Engineering Company, Limited being the contractor of the maintenance project of Wang Fuk Court, the Independent Checking Unit (ICU) under the Bureau had issued orders in accordance with the Buildings Ordinance on November 29 to temporarily suspend the relevant external wall maintenance works with immediate effect.

The ICU had also identified in a special inspection operation that plastic sheeting had been used to cover the windows in the maintenance project in Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po. The registered contractor of the project has been requested to remove the plastic sheeting immediately. Legal advice is being sought when considering prosecution. For thesake of prudence, the ICU has ordered the temporary suspension of the works and requested the contractor to conduct an independent safety audit to review their safety management system. Taking cognisance of the outcome of the safety audit, the contractors are required to submit an improvement plan and implement improvement measures, with a view to demonstrating that they have an effective safety management system in place before the resumption of works can be considered.

On the other hand, the Buildings Department continued its special inspection operation. As of yesterday, 319 buildings undergoing external wall maintenance have been inspected and samples have been taken for testing from buildings installed with scaffold nets. Apart from the two buildings where plastic sheeting was found blocking the windows as announced on November 29 (being removed successively at the Government's instructions), no other buildings were found using foam boards or plastic sheeting to block windows.

The Labour Department (LD) launched a territory-wide special enforcement operation since November 28, targeting the fire protection facilities and fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding erected. This includes checking if protective screens (also known as scaffold nets) on scaffolds are in compliance with recognised standards for fire-retardant materials to enhance occupational safety of workers. As at yesterday, the LD has inspected 51 construction sites, issued a total of 45 written warnings and 12 improvement notices, and has taken out two prosecutions."

  The medical stations currently set up at temporary shelters will remain in operation until closure of the shelters.

繼昨日（十一月二十九日）完成視察宏福苑宏仁閣、宏道閣及宏昌閣首兩層的樓宇整體結構安全情況，截至今日下午五時，房屋局獨立審查組聯同房屋署超過100名專業人員已進一步完成視察宏建閣、宏泰閣、宏盛閣和宏志閣，兩日內共完成視察超過1 500伙單位。宏新閣和宏昌閣的視察工作亦已同步展開。警方已安排足夠人手候命，當確認餘下兩幢大廈安全後，會立即派員入內進行搜索。

根據專業人員暫時評估，已視察樓宇的整體結構沒有即時危險，但少量單位結構損壞較嚴重。房屋局已聯絡緊急維修承建商盡快完成相關鞏固工程，讓警務處及消防處人員能夠盡快進入單位搜證及其他行動。

在處理報稱失聯人士個案方面，警方昨日已完成搜索兩幢大廈，今日再派出600多名「災難遇害者辨認組」人員進入另外三幢大廈進行搜索。截至今日下午四時，警方在大廈內處理共30具遺骸，包括12具早前由消防人員發現但未被移離的遺骸，以及18具新發現的遺骸。死者及傷者數目分別更新至146人及79人。警方會繼續跟進報稱失聯人士個案，務求盡快確認他們的情況及死傷人數。另外，消防處亦已處理全部在火警期間接獲的347宗求助個案。

警方極度重視此案件，正循多方面搜證，作出全面及深入的調查。

房屋局亦表示，宏業建築工程有限公司為宏福苑大維修工程承建商，局方轄下的獨立審查組昨日已根據《建築物條例》發出命令，勒令相關外牆維修工程立即暫時停工。

審查組亦在特別巡查行動中發現深水埗怡閣苑維修工程以塑料膠板遮封窗戶，已即時要求項目註冊承建商移除塑料膠板，並會諮詢法律意見考慮作出檢控。為審慎起見，審查組亦命令該項目暫時停止工程，並已要求該承建商為項目進行獨立安全審核，以檢視其安全管理系統，並按安全審核結果提交改善方案及完成落實改善措施，待審視及確信其具備有效的安全管理系統，才會考慮讓承建商恢復進行工程。

另一方面，屋宇署繼續進行特別巡查行動，截至今日已巡查319幢進行外牆維修的樓宇，並向有棚網的樓宇取樣檢驗。除昨日已公布發現的兩幢有塑膠板遮封窗戶的樓宇（已經按政府指示陸續移除），屋宇署暫未有再發現有發泡膠或塑膠板遮封窗戶的樓宇。

而勞工處於十一月二十八日起展開全港性特別執法行動，巡查設有大型棚架的樓宇維修工程工地的防火設施及火災應變安排，當中包括檢查棚架上的保護幕（俗稱「棚網」）的阻燃性認可標準，以提高對工人的職業安全保障。截至今日，勞工處已巡查51個建築地盤，共發出45份書面警告及12張敦促改善通知書，並提出兩宗檢控。"

TD steers bus routes diversion amid follow-up work of Tai Po fire to ease travel inconvenience,2025-11-30 19:22,2025-11-30 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/30/P2025113000682.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (November 30) said that a number of road sections remain closed amid the follow-up work of the Tai Po fire. The TD has steered the franchised bus operator (FBO) to optimise its diversion plan to ease commuters' inconvenience in going to work or school tomorrow (December 1). Members of the public should plan ahead their journeys and reserve sufficient time.

Public transport

  As sections of Tai Po Road - Yuen Chau Tsai between Nam Wan Road and Tolo Highway (Kowloon bound) and between Kwong Fuk Park and Marvelous Villa (both bounds) remain closed, upon the TD's co-ordination with KMB, starting from their first departures tomorrow, route Nos. 72, 72A, 73A and 74A will be diverted to Tai Po Road - Tai Po Kau via Yau King Lane to take passengers from the affected areas in Tai Po to Sha Tin and urban areas, reducing disruption to commute especially during peak hours.

  The Highways Department and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department have completed the trimming of branches protruding over the carriageway at some locations along Yau King Lane, without compromising the main body of trees. The FBO has also completed the road trial to ensure driving and road safety. The public should refer to the FBOs' website or mobile application for the latest information on their routes.

  The MTR will continue to enhance the frequency of the East Rail Line trains on relevant sections and the service of MTR Buses in Tai Po as needed, while FBOs will reserve standby vehicles and manpower to meet passenger demand.

Traffic

  All lanes of the section of Yuen Shin Road between Tolo Highway and Tai Po Tai Wo Road (Ting Kok Road bound) and the slip road from Tolo Highway (Kowloon bound) to Tai Po Road - Yuen Chau Tsai previously closed have been reopened on the evening of November 28 and this morning respectively. Motorists may use road sections concerned to Tai Po InnoPark/Tai Po North and Nam Wan Road respectively.

  Of note, before the reopening of the remaining closed road sections, the traffic on Tai Po Road, Tolo Highway, Fanling Highway and roads in Tai Po town centre are expected to be busier and the public should avoid driving to these areas. The TD has stepped up the message displayed at variable message signs at relevant locations to alert motorists travelling to Tai Po to use Tat Wan Road, Tai Po Tai Wo Road or Yuen Shin Road. Some road markings have been temporarily modified to ease traffic. Motorists should heed traffic lights, traffic signs and road markings on site and drive carefully.

  The public should heed the latest traffic news through radio and TV broadcasts, the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk) and the HKeMobility mobile application before their journeys, plan ahead and reserve sufficient time."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-30 18:48,2025-11-30 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/30/P2025113000645.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月三十日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————
個案涉及一名67歲女子，居於元朗區。初步調查顯示，她於十一月十五日至十六日及十一月二十日至二十三日分別到訪廣東省中山市及廣州市。她在十一月二十八日出現關節痛，同日到博愛醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。她的五名家居接觸者及五名同行到中山市及廣州市的人士，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人在潛伏期曾前往受基孔肯雅熱影響的地方旅遊，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，會把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得74宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，六宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

就近日在青衣居住的輸入及本地個案，中心在接獲通報後已即時進行流行病學調查及把他們的活動地點通知食物環境衞生署（食環署），以進行控蚊滅蚊行動。鑑於部分確診個案報稱曾在青衣自然徑行山期間被蚊叮咬，中心評估該徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心自十一月二十三日起呼籲近日曾在青衣北一帶活動或在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電中心早前設立的查詢熱線2125 2373。熱線每日上午九時至下午八時運作。中心接獲兩名有輕微病徵的人士致電查詢，並已安排他們進行抽血檢查，兩人的樣本均對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。中心本周亦已透過基層醫療署通知葵青區內約130名基層醫療醫生，呼籲他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。中心的流行病學調查仍然繼續。政府各相關部門已經針對所有輸入個案加強蚊媒防控措施，以及在當區進行個案主動追蹤工作，因此近日青衣的兩宗本地個案對現時整體的風險評估沒有太大影響。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-30 18:48,2025-11-30 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/30/P2025113000646.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 30), the CHP has recorded one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
-----------------------------
 The case involves a 67-year-old female living in Yuen Long District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Zhongshan and Guangzhou in Guangdong from November 15 to 16 and from November 20 to 23 respectively. She developed joint pain on November 28 and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Pok Oi Hospital on the same day. She was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient has five household contacts and five other travel collaterals to Zhongshan and Guangzhou. They are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

As the patient has visited CF-affected areas for travel during the incubation period, the CHP considered that the case was infected during her travel. The case is classified as imported. The CHP will report the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 74 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, six were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

For the recent imported and local cases residing in Tsing Yi, the CHP initiated immediate epidemiological investigations upon notification and notified the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of the patients' activity locations for mosquito control operations. As some confirmed cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considers the trails to be a higher-risk area. As a precautionary measure, the CHP urged individuals who have recently been in the vicinity of Tsing Yi North or hiking in the Tsing Yi Nature Trails since November 23 to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the CHP's enquiry hotline (2125 2373). The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. The CHP received enquiries from two individuals with mild symptoms and has arranged blood tests for them. Both blood samples tested negative for the chikungunya virus. The CHP has also informed approximately 130 primary care doctors in Kwai Tsing District through the Primary Healthcare Commission, urging them to closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing. In view of the strengthened mosquito-borne disease control measures already implemented by the relevant government departments for all imported cases, and active case tracing was conducted in the district, the occurrence of two local cases in Tsing Yi recently have no substantial impacts on the current overall risk assessment.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
再錄得一宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-11-30 17:35,2025-11-30 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/30/P2025113000544.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月三十日）再接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案。中心呼籲家長盡快安排子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的一歲男童。他於十一月二十六日出現發燒、咳嗽和流鼻水，同日向私家醫生求醫。他於昨日（十一月二十九日）出現呼吸急促，被帶到屯門醫院急症室求醫並入住該院，及後因徵狀惡化，轉到該院兒童深切治療部接受治療，目前情況嚴重。他的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型（H3）流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發肺炎和嘶吼症。

男童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗，於潛伏期內不曾外遊。他的兩名家居接觸者近日曾出現呼吸道病徵，病況輕微，無需住院。

計及上述個案，今個夏季流感季節至今已錄得23宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括三宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎11個月至17歲。若單單計算在本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃展開後錄得的14宗個案，只有一人曾在發病前四天接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。然而接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，換言之，這些嚴重個案的兒童都未能受到疫苗保護。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生說：「雖然最新的監測數據顯示，流感活躍程度自十月下旬起逐漸下降，但仍高於基線水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除流感活躍程度仍可能會有反覆，加上明年初或會出現冬季流感季節，因此我再次呼籲所有年滿6個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動。對比今年初冬季流感季節，今季兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案較多。目前，18歲以下兒童中，6個月至2歲以下兒童的覆蓋率相對偏低，只有近17%，希望各位家長不要遲疑，請盡快聯絡自己家庭醫生為子女，以至自己和其他家人安排接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"
CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another severe paediatric influenza infection case reported,2025-11-30 17:35,2025-11-30 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/30/P2025113000546.htm,"âThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 30) recorded another severe paediatric influenza infection case. The CHP urged parents to arrange for their children to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves a 1-year-old boy with good past health. He developed a fever, cough and runny nose on November 26 and sought medical attention from a private doctor on the same day. Since he developed shortness of breath yesterday (November 29), he was brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of Tuen Mun Hospital and was admitted. Due to worsening of symptoms, he was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit of the hospital for further treatment. He is currently in serious condition. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A (H3) virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis is influenza A infection complicated with pneumonia and croup.

The boy has not yet received the 2025/26 SIV and had no travel history during the incubation period. Two of his household contacts developed mild respiratory symptoms recently, but did not require hospitalisation.

Including the abovementioned case, there have been 23 severe influenza cases involving children so far this summer influenza season, including three fatal cases. The affected children aged 11 months to 17 years. A total of 14 cases have been recorded since the launch of this year's SIV Programmes, with only one having received this year's SIV four days prior to the onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, in other words, these severe influenza cases are not protected by the vaccine.

""According to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity has gradually declined since late October. However, it remains above the baseline thresholds. As the weather turns cooler, influenza activity may still fluctuate. Moreover, a winter influenza season may occur early next year. Therefore, I once again urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV to do so promptly. Compared to the winter influenza season earlier this year, there have been more severe paediatric influenza infection cases this season. Currently, among children aged below 18 years, the coverage rate of children aged 6 months to under 2 years is relatively low, at nearly 17 per cent only. Parents should not hesitate and should contact their family doctors as soon as possible to arrange for their children, as well as themselves and other family members, to receive the SIV,"" the Head of Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, said.

He also reminded members of the public that, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly.
