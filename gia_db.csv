威爾斯親王醫院公布一宗化學品洩漏事件,2025-11-17 18:25,2025-11-17 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700535.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

威爾斯親王醫院發言人今日（十一月十七日）就一宗化學品洩漏事件作以下公布：

本院臨床病理學部今日中午發生甲醛洩漏事件，院方立刻啓動應變措施，封鎖受影響範圍，即時通知消防處及報警求助，並安排約180名於臨床病理學部工作的員工於消防員抵達前有秩序離開。當中三名職員感到不適到急症室求診，情況穩定。部分受影響員工已獲安排到部門其他單位工作，本院臨床服務亦不受影響。員工於安全情況下已返回工作崗位。

經初步調查後發現，事件起因懷疑是回收化學品承辦商於運送甲醛期間滲漏引致。

本院有嚴謹指引監管化學品的貯存、處理及棄置程序。本院非常重視事件，已責成化學品回收商盡快提交調查報告，即時跟進事件並實施改善措施。本院會為有需要的員工提供協助，亦已透過早期事故通報系統向醫院管理局總辦事處通報事件。"

The spokesperson for Prince of Wales Hospital today (November 17) announced an incident involving a chemical leakage:

A formaldehyde leakage incident occurred at the Department of Clinical Pathology of Prince of Wales Hospital at around noon today. The hospital immediately activated contingency measures, cordoned off the affected area, promptly notified the Fire Services Department and the Police, and arranged for approximately 180 staff members working in the department to leave the affected area in an orderly manner before the arrival of firemen. Three staff members felt unwell and attended the Accident and Emergency Department. The staff members were in stable condition. Some affected staff have been temporarily deployed to other units within the department. Clinical services of the hospital were not affected. Staff have returned to their working locations under safe circumstances.

A preliminary investigation found that the formaldehyde was leaked while it was being transported by a chemical waste contractor.

The hospital has stringent guidelines to regulate the storage, handling, and disposal of chemicals. The hospital is very concerned about the incident and has instructed the chemical waste contractor to submit an investigation report as soon as possible to follow up on the incident immediately and implement remedial measures. The hospital will render support to staff members in need and has reported the incident to the Hospital Authority Head Office via the Advance Incident Reporting System."

Customs officers intercepted an incoming private car at the Shenzhen Bay Control Point on November 15 and seized 16 780 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $83,900 and a duty potential of about $55,000, from a male passenger's personal luggage. The 58-year-old passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Distinguished guests, friends of the global maritime community, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. It is my great honour to address you at the Government Summit of the World Maritime Merchants Forum. I would like to extend my warmest welcome to you all, particularly those travelling a long way from all parts of the world.

Hong Kong takes pride in our long maritime history. Throughout the years, we have grown from a fishing village to a world-renowned maritime centre. Thanks not only to our excellent geographical location, but also our professional expertise, rule of law and our role as a ""super connector"" linking the East and West.

With the Central People's Government mandate to Hong Kong as an international maritime centre, we have charted new ways to empower the development of our maritime sector. As announced in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, we are establishing a comprehensive ""rail-sea-land-river"" intermodal transport system to extend Hong Kong's cargo sources to inland of the Chinese Mainland. Additionally, we will establish ""partner port"" relationships with Mainland ports, which are of strategic collaboration significance, as well as Belt and Road regions, and prepare for the development of a green shipping corridor.

Green transformation is a major global trend in the maritime industry. Our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering promulgated in 2024 has set our measures in motion, with nearly 200 000 tonnes of liquefied natural gas and biodiesel bunkered this year. Digitalisation is also a vital focus for the development of the maritime industry nowadays. Our Port Community System providing real-time cargo tracking information through Hong Kong ports up to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area will be launched in two months, connecting all stakeholders in the logistics chain, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. The data collected through this system can support trade financing.

Indeed, we have drawn up a long list of tasks through which Hong Kong as an international maritime centre will grow from strength to strength. Let us work together to steer our maritime industry toward a smarter and greener future. On behalf of the Transport and Logistics Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, may I once again express my sincere appreciation for your support to the Hong Kong Maritime Week. I wish you a fruitful and rewarding week ahead. Thank you.

運輸及物流局局長在香港海運週2025開幕典禮暨2025世界航商大會政府峰會專場致辭（附圖）,2025-11-17 18:15,2025-11-17 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700552.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（十一月十七日）出席香港海運週2025開幕典禮暨2025世界航商大會政府峰會專場的致辭全文：

尊敬的行政長官（行政長官李家超）、梁振英副主席（全國政協副主席）、周霽主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室主任）、付緒銀副部長（國家交通運輸部副部長）、陳楓副署長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全公署副署長）、李永勝特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署署理特派員）、繆建民董事長（招商局集團董事長）、各位嘉賓、全球航運界的朋友們、女士們、先生們：

大家下午好！熱烈歡迎各位蒞臨世界航商大會主論壇。今年首次舉辦政府峰會專場，非常榮幸有機會向各位介紹香港特區政府在推動航運發展的工作和部署。

感謝中央政府全力支持香港的航運業發展。二十屆四中全會剛剛通過了《中共中央關於制定國民經濟和社會發展第十五個五年規劃的建議》，明確支持香港鞏固提升國際航運中心的地位。

為了不負國家的託付和支持，我們積極推動航運業發展，包括在二○二三年及二○二四年分別發布了《海運及港口發展策略行動綱領》及《綠色船用燃料加注行動綱領》，以及於今年七月成立香港海運港口發展局，推動業界的可持續發展。

行政長官在今年的《施政報告》中提出一系列重要舉措，全力推動香港航運業繼續破浪前行。我們正全力構建「鐵海陸江」立體聯運體系，拓展貨源至國家內陸腹地。此外，我們將與內地具戰略合作意義及「一帶一路」地區建立伙伴港口關係，共同提升香港及伙伴港口的競爭力和韌性，並為建立未來的綠色航運走廊做好準備。

香港亦正全力推進綠色與數字化港口發展。我們已加注近20萬公噸綠色燃料，亦即將開始甲醇加注。數字化方面，明年初推出的港口社區系統將成為智慧港口的重要基石。系統收集的貨物數據將有助加強貿易融資，做到以貨物流打通資金流。

為鞏固香港的航運集群，更好支撐香港的高端海事服務擴展，我們將修訂法律為合資格大宗商品貿易商提供半稅優惠及提升香港船舶註冊的靈活度（包括引入雙旗註冊制度）。

再次感謝中央的支持，特區會繼續不遺餘力，建設好國家的國際航運中心。

入境處聯同內地執法機關瓦解跨境假結婚犯罪集團（附圖）,2025-11-17 17:55,2025-11-17 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700521.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）與廣東內地公安出入境管理部門於十一月十七日展開一個代號「閃刺2025」的聯合行動，成功瓦解一個跨境假結婚犯罪集團。行動中，入境處調查行動組人員搜查兩個住宅單位，共拘捕了兩名香港居民，包括一男一女，年齡為43歲及57歲。被捕人士相信為該集團的主腦及骨幹成員。此外，內地執法部門於廣東先後拘捕兩名集團骨幹成員及八名涉嫌假結婚的內地居民。

於二○二三至二○二四年間，入境處與內地執法部門調查人員發現多宗犯案手法相近的懷疑假結婚個案，經深入分析及調查後，鎖定一個由被捕人士為首的跨境假結婚犯罪集團。該犯罪集團透過網上買賣平台及即時通訊軟件招攬及安排香港居民與非本地居民進行假結婚而謀利。此外，犯罪集團為了招攬更多人士參與假結婚，會透過「佣金制」的方式去利誘已經參與假結婚的涉案人士，以協助集團招攬更多人士參與假結婚。每當成功安排一名人士進行假結婚後便可以賺取佣金，以鼓勵他們招攬更多人士參與非法勾當。

入境處相信，該犯罪集團於二○二三至二○二四年間共安排超過60宗假結婚，涉案金額超過港幣750萬元。連同今日行動中被捕的兩名香港居民，入境處的執法行動至今已拘捕共37人，包括18男19女，當中32名為香港居民及五名為非本地居民，被捕人士年齡介乎20至65歲。調查行動目前仍然繼續進行，入境處及內地執法部門不排除將有更多涉案人士被拘捕。

入境處一直十分關注非本地居民透過與香港居民假結婚以騙取香港居留身分的犯罪活動。入境處會繼續大力打擊任何人士透過假結婚騙取香港居留的非法活動。任何人士如以欺詐手段取得香港居民身分，將會被依法取消留港資格及身份證，涉案人士最後亦會被遣返原居地。

入境處發言人呼籲市民切勿以身試法，不要參與在任何地方登記的假結婚事宜，或在香港登記結婚時對入境處職員作出虛假申述。轉介其他人士參與假結婚亦有可能構成串謀詐騙罪行。入境處亦提醒市民，使用網上買賣平台或即時通訊軟件時需提高警覺，以免墮入假結婚集團的圈套。

根據現行香港法例，任何人士如向入境處職員作出虛假申述乃屬違法，一經定罪，最高罰款為港幣15萬元及入獄14年，協助及教唆者同罪。任何人士為促致達成婚姻或取得關於結婚的證明書或許可證，明知而故意作出虛假誓言或作出或簽署虛假聲明乃屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判處監禁七年及罰款。而干犯串謀欺詐罪行，一經定罪，最高亦可被判監禁14年。"
Cross-boundary bogus marriage syndicate smashed by ImmD and Mainland authorities (with photo),2025-11-17 17:55,2025-11-17 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700522.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a joint operation codenamed ""Flashspear 2025"" with Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department on November 17. The operation successfully neutralised a cross-boundary bogus marriage syndicate. During the operation, officers from the Outside Investigation Section of the ImmD raided two residential units. Two Hong Kong residents - one man and one woman, aged 43 and 57 - were arrested. The arrested persons were believed to be the mastermind and core members of the cross-boundary bogus marriage syndicate. In addition, Mainland authorities arrested two syndicate members and eight Mainlanders who were suspected to have contracted bogus marriages in Guangdong.

  From 2023 to 2024, officers from the ImmD and Mainland authorities found that multiple suspected bogus marriage cases had a similar mode of operation. Following in-depth analysis and investigations, a cross-boundary bogus marriage syndicate headed by the arrested persons was identified. The syndicate used online trading platforms and instant messaging software to recruit and arrange bogus marriages between Hong Kong residents and non-local residents for profit. Furthermore, to attract more individuals to participate in bogus marriages, the syndicate incentivised those who were already involved by offering a ""commission system"", so as to assist the syndicate in recruiting more people to participate in the bogus marriage activities. With each successful arrangement of a bogus marriage, the recruiter received a commission, thereby motivating them to enlist more individuals in these illegal activities.

  The ImmD believed that the syndicate had arranged for more than 60 bogus marriages between 2023 and 2024. The estimated transaction amount involved in the cases is over HK$7.5 million. During the operation, as of today, a total of 37 persons (18 men and 19 women, aged 20 to 65), including the two Hong Kong residents arrested during the operation today, were arrested. Thirty-two of them were Hong Kong residents, and five were non-local residents. The investigation is still ongoing, and more persons involved in the case may be arrested.

  The ImmD has been concerned about non-Hong Kong residents obtaining residency by means of contracting bogus marriages with Hong Kong residents. The ImmD will continue to spare no effort in combating bogus marriages and other related illicit activities. For people who have obtained their residency in Hong Kong by fraudulent means, their Hong Kong identity card and residency status will be invalidated according to the laws of Hong Kong. They will also be subject to removal back to their place of origin.

  An ImmD spokesman urged the public not to defy the law by participating in activities related to bogus marriages anywhere or making a false oath before Immigration Officers for the purpose of procuring a marriage in Hong Kong. Those directing others to contract a bogus marriage may also be guilty of the offence of conspiracy to defraud. The spokesman also urged the public to raise their alert when using online trading platforms and instant messaging software, and to avoid falling into the trap of bogus marriage syndicates.

  Under the laws of Hong Kong, it is an offence to make false representations to Immigration Officers. Offenders are liable to prosecution and to a maximum fine of $150,000 and imprisonment for 14 years. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and the same penalties. Any person who, for the purpose of procuring a marriage or a certificate or license for marriage, knowingly and wilfully makes a false oath or makes or signs a false declaration shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to, upon conviction, imprisonment for seven years and a fine. Anyone who commits the offence of conspiracy to defraud is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years."

"Speech by CE at Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference 2025 (English only)",2025-11-17 16:30,2025-11-17 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700478.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference 2025 today (November 17):

Honourable Deputy Minister Almaz Turgunbaev (Deputy Minister of Transport and Communications, Kyrgyz Republic), Professor Frederick Ma (Chairman, Hong Kong Trade Development Council), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. It's a great pleasure to welcome you to the 15th Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference, and to Hong Kong, Asia's logistics capital.

  A special welcome to Mr Turgunbaev, the Kyrgyz Republic's Deputy Minister of Transport and Communications. He's here to share with you the latest logistics developments, and business and investment opportunities, in Kyrgyzstan. And I am sure he's eager to hear from you, too.

  After all, some 2 300 high-profile logistics leaders and professionals from more than 40 countries and regions are here for this year's two-day conference. Here to learn more about prospects in Central Asia and the Middle East in special conference sessions. Here, too, for insight and intelligence spotlighting supply chain diversification, sustainability and green energy, innovation and technology, the low-altitude economy and much more.

  The conference theme this year, ""Collaboration and Growth in the New Trade Landscape"", is a timely response to rising geopolitical tensions and the volatile global trade policies, which present considerable challenges for our maritime, aviation and logistics industries, from route planning and shipping fleet deployment to inventory and warehouse management.

  Nevertheless, as the Chinese saying goes, ""where there are challenges, there are opportunities"". Geopolitical risks can be overcome by market diversification. Increased costs related to supply chain concerns can be offset, at least partially, by technology-enabled efficiencies.

  Hong Kong is well-positioned to weather the storm and seize new opportunities. We are an international shipping and trading centre strategically located in the heart of Asia, and a pivotal player in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. As the world's largest manufacturing base, the Greater Bay Area commands an extensive air and sea transport network.

  Hong Kong is also the world's busiest air cargo hub and one of its busiest sea ports. And I am confident we will create new and rewarding collaborations, while taking full advantage of the latest technologies to maintain the sustainable growth of our maritime, aviation and logistics sector.

  We are, for example, deepening our connections with both traditional and emerging markets. And we are exploring new opportunities in the Belt and Road countries.

  Today, I am particularly pleased to announce that Hong Kong has established Partner Port relationships with Guangxi port and Dalian port in the Chinese Mainland, and Port San Antonio in Chile. These ports are of strategic importance, and true to our character and policy priorities. As an international maritime centre, we connect the Chinese Mainland with the world and seek partners who support an open, international trade order.

  Hong Kong is also committed to building a sustainable future powered by digital and green transformation. Harnessing the power of AI, blockchain, cloud computing and other cutting-edge technologies, we are developing a Port Community System. Launching in January, it will enable real-time cargo tracking and facilitate data exchange across transport modes, boosting trade and capital flows digitally. That opens up new opportunities, from trade financing to more efficient customs declaration.

  The low altitude economy represents another promising growth area. Building on our initial regulatory sandbox pilot projects, we will introduce an advanced regulatory sandbox for complex scenarios, aimed at expanding the low altitude economy. This will facilitate its application in logistics and other innovative business sectors.

  We are also committed to Hong Kong's rise as a green maritime fuel bunkering hub. It's been a year since our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering was published. With its orderly implementation, Hong Kong is emerging as a major port offering regular commercial bunkering services for multiple types of fuel.

  Our ambitions, however, are larger than that. We are looking to build the necessary infrastructure for Hong Kong to become a global centre of trade for green maritime fuel, especially those produced in the Chinese Mainland, by far the world's biggest supplier.

  An equally green endeavour is our pursuit of ESG (environmental, social, and governance) expertise in the logistics field. In June, we published an ESG roadmap for the logistics industry, providing a clear pathway to ESG compliance. It will help strengthen the competitiveness of our logistics industry players, particularly SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), putting us at the forefront in the world's continuing pursuit of sustainability.

  Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong has long thrived in the face of adversity. Resilience defines us as an international maritime centre and aviation and logistics hub.

  With Hong Kong as your partner, you can confidently ride the wave of opportunities this region has to offer, building strong supply chains together through our extensive business and transport networks and internationally recognised institutional strengths.

  My thanks to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council for organising this year's Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference. It is one of the two anchor events of this year's Hong Kong Maritime Week, alongside the World Maritime Merchants Forum, which also opened today and continues through tomorrow.

  Hong Kong Maritime Week runs through November 22, packed full of forums, conferences, seminars, tours, visits, receptions, and much more, all under the theme ""Navigating to a Greener Future"" - where we all want to be.

  I wish you the best of business at the conference, and a memorable stay in Hong Kong, Asia's world city, and the East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. Thank you."

Statistics presented in the ""Drug Situation in Hong Kong in 2024"" article are based on the data source from the Security Bureau, Government Secretariat.

""Statistics on Chinese Medicine in Hong Kong, 2024""

Chinese medicine has a long history in Hong Kong. The Government has been adopting a multipronged approach to facilitate the development of the Chinese medicine sector in Hong Kong. The Chinese medicine sector comprises : (a) manufacture of Chinese medicines; (b) distribution of Chinese medicines, including import/export, wholesale and retail trades; and (c) practising Chinese medicine, including Chinese medicine practitioners of general practice, acupuncture and bone-setting.

This feature article discusses the updated situation of some Chinese medicine activities including the manufacture of Chinese medicines and the distribution of Chinese medicines, as well as the external trade of Chinese herbal medicines.

For enquiries about this feature article, please contact the Distribution Services Statistics Section of the C&SD (Tel: 3903 7398; email: asw@censtatd.gov.hk).

""Drug Situation in Hong Kong in 2024""

This feature article gives an overview of the drug situation in Hong Kong in 2024 by making reference to statistics derived from the Central Registry of Drug Abuse. Moreover, statistics on the ""2023/24 Survey of Drug Use among Students"" and law enforcement on drug offences are presented. These statistics and findings provide useful information on the latest drug situation in Hong Kong, and support an evidence-based approach to the formulation of anti-drug policy and measures. The drug problem has continued to ameliorate through the concerted efforts of the government and the community. According to the Central Registry of Drug Abuse, the total number of reported drug abusers has dropped by around 40% over the past decade. However, phenomena such as increases in the reported number of young drug abusers in recent years, a high proportion of reported number of young adult drug abusers, and the involvement of young people in drug offences still warrant our attention.

"Speech by CE at Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference 2025 (English only) (with photos/video)",2025-11-17 16:30,2025-11-17 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700478.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference 2025 today (November 17):

Honourable Deputy Minister Almaz Turgunbaev (Deputy Minister of Transport and Communications, Kyrgyz Republic), Professor Frederick Ma (Chairman, Hong Kong Trade Development Council), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. It's a great pleasure to welcome you to the 15th Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference, and to Hong Kong, Asia's logistics capital.

  A special welcome to Mr Turgunbaev, the Kyrgyz Republic's Deputy Minister of Transport and Communications. He's here to share with you the latest logistics developments, and business and investment opportunities, in Kyrgyzstan. And I am sure he's eager to hear from you, too.

  After all, some 2 300 high-profile logistics leaders and professionals from more than 40 countries and regions are here for this year's two-day conference. Here to learn more about prospects in Central Asia and the Middle East in special conference sessions. Here, too, for insight and intelligence spotlighting supply chain diversification, sustainability and green energy, innovation and technology, the low-altitude economy and much more.

  The conference theme this year, ""Collaboration and Growth in the New Trade Landscape"", is a timely response to rising geopolitical tensions and the volatile global trade policies, which present considerable challenges for our maritime, aviation and logistics industries, from route planning and shipping fleet deployment to inventory and warehouse management.

  Nevertheless, as the Chinese saying goes, ""where there are challenges, there are opportunities"". Geopolitical risks can be overcome by market diversification. Increased costs related to supply chain concerns can be offset, at least partially, by technology-enabled efficiencies.

  Hong Kong is well-positioned to weather the storm and seize new opportunities. We are an international shipping and trading centre strategically located in the heart of Asia, and a pivotal player in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. As the world's largest manufacturing base, the Greater Bay Area commands an extensive air and sea transport network.

  Hong Kong is also the world's busiest air cargo hub and one of its busiest sea ports. And I am confident we will create new and rewarding collaborations, while taking full advantage of the latest technologies to maintain the sustainable growth of our maritime, aviation and logistics sector.

  We are, for example, deepening our connections with both traditional and emerging markets. And we are exploring new opportunities in the Belt and Road countries.

  Today, I am particularly pleased to announce that Hong Kong has established Partner Port relationships with Guangxi port and Dalian port in the Chinese Mainland, and Port San Antonio in Chile. These ports are of strategic importance, and true to our character and policy priorities. As an international maritime centre, we connect the Chinese Mainland with the world and seek partners who support an open, international trade order.

  Hong Kong is also committed to building a sustainable future powered by digital and green transformation. Harnessing the power of AI, blockchain, cloud computing and other cutting-edge technologies, we are developing a Port Community System. Launching in January, it will enable real-time cargo tracking and facilitate data exchange across transport modes, boosting trade and capital flows digitally. That opens up new opportunities, from trade financing to more efficient customs declaration.

  The low altitude economy represents another promising growth area. Building on our initial regulatory sandbox pilot projects, we will introduce an advanced regulatory sandbox for complex scenarios, aimed at expanding the low altitude economy. This will facilitate its application in logistics and other innovative business sectors.

  We are also committed to Hong Kong's rise as a green maritime fuel bunkering hub. It's been a year since our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering was published. With its orderly implementation, Hong Kong is emerging as a major port offering regular commercial bunkering services for multiple types of fuel.

  Our ambitions, however, are larger than that. We are looking to build the necessary infrastructure for Hong Kong to become a global centre of trade for green maritime fuel, especially those produced in the Chinese Mainland, by far the world's biggest supplier.

  An equally green endeavour is our pursuit of ESG (environmental, social, and governance) expertise in the logistics field. In June, we published an ESG roadmap for the logistics industry, providing a clear pathway to ESG compliance. It will help strengthen the competitiveness of our logistics industry players, particularly SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), putting us at the forefront in the world's continuing pursuit of sustainability.

  Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong has long thrived in the face of adversity. Resilience defines us as an international maritime centre and aviation and logistics hub.

  With Hong Kong as your partner, you can confidently ride the wave of opportunities this region has to offer, building strong supply chains together through our extensive business and transport networks and internationally recognised institutional strengths.

  My thanks to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council for organising this year's Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference. It is one of the two anchor events of this year's Hong Kong Maritime Week, alongside the World Maritime Merchants Forum, which also opened today and continues through tomorrow.

  Hong Kong Maritime Week runs through November 22, packed full of forums, conferences, seminars, tours, visits, receptions, and much more, all under the theme ""Navigating to a Greener Future"" - where we all want to be.

  I wish you the best of business at the conference, and a memorable stay in Hong Kong, Asia's world city, and the East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. Thank you."
天氣轉冷市民應注意健康,2025-11-17 16:15,2025-11-17 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700221.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月十七日）表示，由於本港氣溫將顯著下降，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————

中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

有關更多健康資訊，可致電衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111），或參閱衞生防護中心網頁和Facebook專頁，以及勞工處於在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，對僱主及僱員發布應採取預防措施的新聞公報。

CHP reminds public to take precautions during upcoming cold weather,2025-11-17 16:15,2025-11-17 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700225.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 17) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health as the temperature in Hong Kong will drop significantly.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.


  Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


âIn addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpage as well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

 The public may also call Dial-a-Weather (1878 200) or visit thewebsite of the Hong Kong Observatoryfor the latest weather information and forecasts, or itspage on Weather Information for Senior Citizens."

HKO and SCHSA remind public that weather will cool appreciably in next few days (with photo),2025-11-17 16:10,2025-11-17 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700217.htm,"  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and the Senior Citizen Home Safety Association (SCHSA) held a joint press conference today (November 17) to remind the public that the weather will become appreciably cooler in the next few days and to prepare for winter.

  The Acting Assistant Director of the HKO, Ms Tse Shuk-mei, said at the press conference, ""A cold front is moving southwards. It is expected to move across the coast of Guangdong around midnight tonight. Under the influence of the associated intense northeast monsoon, it will be windy and appreciably cooler in the next couple of days. Meanwhile, under a broad band of clouds, it will be cloudy with one or two light rain patches in Hong Kong. On Wednesday and Thursday, temperatures will drop to about 14 degrees in the urban areas, and it will be cold over parts of the New Territories. As it will be windy, wind chill effect will be rather significant. It will still be cool in the morning later this week. The public, especially the elderly, persons with chronic medical conditions, or those planning for outdoor activities, should pay attention to the changing weather and take appropriate precautions.""

  The Chief Executive Officer of the SCHSA, Ms Maura Wong, said, ""The SCHSA's 24/7 'Care-On-Call' Service Centre sees a sharp rise in requests for assistance every winter. Last winter, we handled an average of 95.6 emergency-aid requests per day via the 'Care-On-Call' system, which is 12.6 per cent more than the daily average in 2024. We urge the elderly to keep warm and request assistance through 'Care-On-Call' services promptly if they feel unwell. Caregivers should also proactively care for the elderly around them and make sure they receive appropriate support.""

Closing remarks by STL at Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit (English only) (with photo),2025-11-17 15:53,2025-11-17 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700402.htm,"âFollowing are the closing remarks by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit today (November 17):

Mr Grimaldi (Chairman of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), Mr Emanuele Grimaldi), your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, all the distinguished guests that have come to this summit today,

Good afternoon. As we bring this impactful Summit to a close, may I express my gladness seeing that our discussions in the past two days have powerfully demonstrated how our global maritime community is navigating shared challenges - from trade realignment and supply chain resilience to financing our industry’s future. These dialogues have been frank and collaborative, as to be seen from our closed-door session yesterday as well as today's sessions, reflecting our common goal and the spirit of partnership we all value. During the summit, we have heard a number of buzzwords: fragmentation, deglobalisation, protectionism, unpredictability, collaboration, partnership and most important of all - solutions.

Scene setting

In an era of volatility, isolation or unilateralism is certainly not the solution. It must be forged through partnership. The government's role is not to direct, but to enable - to build the fundamental and foundational backbone that allows the private sector to innovate, invest and thrive. This philosophy underpins our recent establishment in Hong Kong of the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board (HKMPDB) under the able leadership of the Honourable Dr Moses Cheng (Chairman of the HKMPDB, Dr Moses Cheng Mo-chi), ensuring government and industry work as co-pilots in shaping our maritime future.

Guided by this principle and bolstered by our nation's strong support, Hong Kong adopts a clear dual strategy: reinforcing the resilience of our local maritime ecosystem, while expanding opportunities in the Chinese Mainland and in the rest of the world.

First, we are enhancing both our port competitiveness and world-class maritime services. Our port's efficiency remains a key advantage, with vessel-handling speeds nearly double the global average - earning us the ""catch-up port"" reputation. We are capitalising on this by establishing a comprehensive ""rail-sea-land-river"" intermodal system to extend our cargo hinterland into inland provinces of the Chinese Mainland. Meanwhile, we are not only driving digital and green transformation through launching a new Port Community System for real-time cargo tracking amongst all stakeholders, we are also working, with the port operators, toward reducing our Kwai Tsing Container Terminals' carbon emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.

Complementing our port assets, we have an unparalleled cluster of over 1 200 shipping and maritime service companies, including the world's top ship managers, major protection and indemnity clubs and leading financers, as supported by one of the world’s largest fleets by gross tonnage flying the Hong Kong flag. To future-proof this leadership, we are streamlining our shipping registry procedures, enhancing tax incentives for the ship lessors and shipping commercial principals as well as introducing tax concessions for commodity traders, with legislative amendments coming right next year. Further, we will strengthen collaboration with international marine insurance organisations to upscale the training of marine insurance talents, whilst expanding the scope of the Maritime and Aviation Training Fund to cover more green energy courses, thereby reinforcing Hong Kong maritime strengths.

Secondly, we are proactively forging international partnerships to unlock new growth potential and solidify our role as a global ""super connector"". To counter protectionism, we are building partner port relationships with strategic ports in the Chinese Mainland and key Belt and Road regions for enhancing mutual competitiveness and resilience. Do expect our announcement of the first batch of our partner ports shortly later today. At the same time, central to this strategy is the Hong Kong Maritime Week itself, including the ICS World Trade Summit - our cornerstone platform for deepening international exchanges and collaboration. Every November, this gathering transforms our city into a vital nexus where global industry leaders converge to shape and drive positive changes for the future of the maritime trade. I am excited to share with you that we will be welcoming the Silk Road Maritime Association's summit one year from now during Hong Kong Maritime Week 2026, so stay tuned. This event and the week-long event will foster a strategic dialogue to unlock new opportunities in Belt and Road shipping for Hong Kong and the global community.

Despite the postponement in the IMO(International Maritime Organization)'s schedule, which we touched upon a lot during these two days, we, in Hong Kong remain steadfast in advancing our pace to strengthen and solidify Hong Kong's role as an international green maritime fuel bunkering and trading hub. Our prime location at the southern tip of China places us at the crossroads of international fairways, ideal for serving the global shipping community's bunkering needs. We rank seventh globally in shipping fuel bunkering, second in China and first in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Since the first LNG (liquefied natural gas) bunkering operation in February this year, over 200 000 metric tonnes of biodiesel and LNG have been bunkered in Hong Kong, involving a total of 13 LNG bunkering operations. Having established biodiesel and LNG bunkering, we are pioneering the next-generation fuels - including methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen. We will commence feasibility studies for ammonia and hydrogen bunkering and mandate mass flow meters for methanol operations by next year. Further, leveraging our nation's green fuel supply advantages and Hong Kong's robust financial infrastructure, we are developing a global green maritime fuel trading centre, hosting various matchmaking events to catalyse supply chains and support our nation in reinforcing its leadership in this emerging sector.

The geopolitical landscape today affirms that the old rulebook is being rewritten. In this new chapter, Hong Kong's value proposition under ""one country, two systems"" becomes more relevant than ever after - offering a stable, sophisticated common law platform with a trusted legal framework, free flow of capital and information, as well as professional expertise that de-risks global trade. Hong Kong is here to serve and facilitate you to not just navigate today's challenges, but seize tomorrow's opportunities.

Ladies and gentlemen, while this Summit is about to conclude, I trust that the collaboration and dialogue will go on. As Hong Kong Maritime Week continues with other events, I look forward to welcoming you there.

Thank you to the ICS, our co-organisers, and all of you for your invaluable contributions. Congratulations to the ICS for, once again, hosting and staging such a successful summit this year. I wish you a productive remainder of your time in Hong Kong and enjoy the buzz and the nice weather outside of the Asia's World City. Thank you."

Honourable Vice Chairman C Y Leung (Vice-Chairman of National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), Honourable Director Zhou Ji (Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government (CPG) in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)), Vice Minister Fu Xuyin (Vice Minister of Transport), Deputy Head Chen Feng (Deputy Head, Office for Safeguarding National Security of the CPG in the HKSAR), Acting Commissioner Li Yongsheng (Acting Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR), Chairman Miao Jianmin (Chairman of China Merchants Group), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. A very warm welcome to Hong Kong, Asia's world city, and to the opening of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 and the fifth World Maritime Merchants Forum, which bring together our maritime cluster, and underline Hong Kong's status as one of the world's leading maritime centres.

  The theme for the Hong Kong Maritime Week, ""Navigating to a Greener Future"", signals our shared destination. Complementing this, the theme of the World Maritime Merchants Forum, ""Steering Sustainability Through Changes"", is our navigational chart for the journey ahead.

  In a world being reshaped by geopolitical discord, technological disruption and climate change, these themes are more than aspirational. They sound an alarm, a wake-up call to collective action.

  In this era of profound and complex transformation, Hong Kong's role as a stable, reliable and dynamic maritime hub has never been more vital. The principle of ""one country, two systems"" is the cornerstone of our success, providing us with an unshakeable foundation.

  As our country's only bilingual common law jurisdiction, Hong Kong offers a simple and low tax regime, free port status and the unfettered flow of capital, information and talent.

  Our standing is consistently acknowledged, and endorsed, by the international community. For the sixth consecutive year, Hong Kong ranked fourth, globally, in the International Shipping Centre Development Index. This pays tribute to our strengths in port infrastructure, maritime services and overall operating environment.

  Hong Kong is home to more than 1 200 port and maritime-related companies, a thriving cluster of global leaders in ship management, finance, insurance and law. The Hong Kong Shipowners Mutual Assurance Association's launch ceremony, in just a few minutes, will mark a milestone development, further enriching our maritime services and reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"".

  Our tax concession regime for high value-added maritime services continues to attract global businesses. And we are planning to extend half-rate tax concessions to physical commodity traders, further integrating the critical pillars of trade, commodities and shipping here in Hong Kong.

  Beyond our business-friendly foundations, our focus is firmly on the future. And the imperative for green growth is the defining challenge, and opportunity, of our generation.

  With the International Maritime Organization's Net-Zero Framework targeting to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in international shipping by around the year 2050, Hong Kong is determined to be at the forefront, as a premier green maritime fuel-bunkering centre.

  Since publishing our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering a year ago, we have materialised regular commercial liquefied natural gas and biodiesel bunkering.

  Our vision is to become the epicentre of the global green maritime fuel trade. And our proximity to the Chinese Mainland, the world's largest producer of green maritime fuel, is a critical advantage. We will continue to collaborate with maritime associations and business partners globally to drive the transition towards sustainability.

  Indeed, collaboration on an unprecedented scale is essential as we face challenges from geopolitical tensions, trade protectionism, technological disruption, and the climate crisis - issues too vast for any single economy to solve alone.

  Let's work together to build green shipping corridors and digital trade lanes that will define the future of safe, efficient and sustainable global shipping.

  Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is ready to be your partner. Our policy support, expertise, strategic vision and unwavering commitment can play a pivotal role in navigating the next era of shipping. Together, we can steer a course towards a more sustainable, prosperous and collaborative future.

  I wish you all a rewarding Hong Kong Maritime Week, a productive World Maritime Merchants Forum, and fair winds and following seas, in business as in life. Thank you."

創新科技及工業局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-11-17 13:57,2025-11-17 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700338.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（十一月十七日）出席香港國際電腦會議2025開幕儀式後會見傳媒的談話內容：

創新科技及工業局局長：各位媒體朋友，各位市民，大家早上好。今天我很高興向大家分享一下，最近香港特區政府關於加快推進創科產業發展的情況。大家知道，國家「十五五」規劃建議明確支持香港建設國際創新科技中心，特別強調科技創新與產業創新融合發展，加速建立國家的現代化產業體系。香港將會緊密對接國家的發展戰略，加速建設國際創新科技中心。

在這樣一個大的環境下，我們最近推出了幾項措施。第一項措施是在本周四（十一月二十日），我們將會公布北部都會區《新田科技城創科產業發展規劃概念綱要》。概念綱要主要從三部分闡述未來新田科技城產業發展的定位、產業和空間地塊的分布，以及發展模式。關於定位，大家知道我們未來新田科技城主要定位於創科產業的發展。我們將會聚焦幾大領域，包括生命健康、人工智能與機械人、微電子與智能設備、新能源、新材料及綠色科技等，主要是聚焦以先進製造為核心的香港創科產業體系的建設。在發展上，我們更多聚焦於一些產品的原型、中試產業，以及小規模生產。根據香港的特色因地制宜，也會考慮重點發展一些適合香港情況的重點創科產業。

第二項是關於新田科技城產業發展的布局。我們會根據土地推出的持續情況，分五個階段去發展未來新田科技城。具體來說，我們會提出要打造「三個樞紐」作為核心區，包括河套、洲頭和麒麟。圍繞「三個樞紐」，我們會布局產業帶。我們特別要強調產業、人才和空間的相互配合和促進，打造「產城融合」這樣一個宜居城市。第三個方面是關於發展模式。我想在發展模式方面，特區政府會遵照「有為政府」，加上「高效市場」的大原則，我們會建議成立一家「平台公司」，借助市場力量，加速發展新田科技城。

除了剛才我介紹的新田科技城的發展規劃之外，大家可能注意到上個星期我們也迎來了一個重要的里程碑，就是「創科產業引導基金」已經正式啓動基金經理的申請程序。這是本屆特區政府推出的第三個以產業發展為導向的百億元計劃。這個百億元計劃目的是通過政府適當的投資和引領，來撬動更多市場資本投資未來具策略性的創科產業，打通香港創科產業發展的「最後一公里」。基金將會聚焦於五大板塊，包括生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人、半導體與智能設備、數字化與轉型升級，再有就是未來與可持續發展。在每個板塊下，我們會設立一到數個子基金，每個子基金由普通合夥人（General Partner, GP）作為基金經理管理。政府將會作為有限合夥人，總共投資100億元到各個子基金去。過去一段時間來，我們已經成功吸引了一定數量的策略投資人加入到「創科產業引導基金」作為有限合夥人。我們也繼續邀請更多策略投資人加入到這個基金。我主要是跟大家介紹一下這兩個最近推出的重點舉措。謝謝大家。

記者：想請教剛才說新田科技城的定位是生命健康、人工智能科技，好像跟以前提過河套的定位差不多，其實將來的分布會是怎樣，會有甚麼不同？

創新科技及工業局局長：我想新田科技城的定位與河套，包括其他香港的科技園是有不同的，新田科技城主要定位於產業發展，我們發展產業。產業發展來說是重點打造以先進製造為核心的產業，希望建立起香港的創科產業體系。河套的定位主要做一些R&D（研發），也會做一些中試發展。新田科技城會提供成片土地供企業在這裏面做大規模生產，我們會做產品原型、中試，也鼓勵做一些小規模生產。另外，根據香港的特色，我們也會考慮發展幾個適合香港特色的、稍為大規模的產業。就在這點來說的話，它跟其他園區的定位是有所不同的。

記者：局長，有沒有一些例子是適合香港的產業，大概是哪些？以及剛才提到該布局分五階段，是哪五個階段？有沒有時間表？

創新科技及工業局局長：關於定甚麼樣的產業，這次這份新田科技城的規劃綱要是我們之前委託顧問團隊，過去兩年來做了周密的研究。我們走訪了40多個團體，會見了超過100個創科界的人士。根據各種統計結果，我們提出了幾大產業分布，就剛剛我提到的，包括生命健康、機械人、人工智能、新材料、新能源等等。這都是認為是可能適合香港未來發展的方向。具體最終哪幾個方向能夠做得更好，下一步還要聽市場的反饋。所以，下一步我們會重點考慮要引入一些龍頭企業，通過龍頭企業的引入能夠帶動上下游的發展。關於你說的五個發展期是怎麼定的，我想這主要是根據我們未來收地的程序，再有就是根據我們產業進駐的情況。我們大概提出了五個階段，當然也可能在未來的發展中會根據情況做一些調整。總而言之，我們希望未來能夠加速發展，能夠通過新田科技城匯聚全世界的創科資源到這個地方。

記者：有沒有時間表大概第一階段是何時？

創新科技及工業局局長：我想具體的時間，馬上周四，我們會公布這樣一個規劃概念綱要的詳細情況，我想到時候可以參閱。

記者：最後想問發展模式是否傾向公私營合作？之前《施政報告》提過的直接批地是否方向之一？

創新科技及工業局局長：我想發展模式主要爭取「有為政府」加上「高效市場」這大原則，我們會提出建立一個「平台公司」，「 平台公司 」可以參考比如現在科學園或者數碼港這樣的形式。一方面加強政府的引領，保證長期的規劃，同時要充分借助市場的力量、市場的資源、市場的開發速度和效果。這樣的話，我們希望能夠政府與市場相結合，能夠高速度、高質量的快速建立起新田科技城的創科產業。謝謝大家。"
Speech by Secretary for Health at International Genomic Medicine Symposium (English only) (with photos),2025-11-17 12:27,2025-11-17 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700272.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, at the International Genomic Medicine Symposium today (November 17):

Mr Philip Tsai (Chairperson of the Hong Kong Genome Institute (HKGI)), Dr SV Lo (Chief Executive Officer of the HKGI, Dr Lo Su-vui) , Dr Kirsten Johnson (Chair of the Council, Rare Diseases International (RDI)), Professor Roberto Giugliani (Co-Chair of the RDI-Lancet Commission on Rare Diseases (LCRD)), Professor Kym Boycott (Co-Chair of the RDI-LCRD), distinguished speakers and guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is a pleasure for me to attend the International Genomic Medicine Symposium. On behalf of the Health Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Hong Kong Genome Institute, Rare Diseases International, and the Rare Disease International-Lancet Commission on Rare Diseases (RDI-LCRD), for their exemplary efforts in convening this world-class gathering. It gives me great pleasure to welcome so many distinguished clinicians, scientists, and healthcare professionals to the International Genomic Medicine Symposium.

  This Symposium brings together experts and leaders from more than 20 countries and regions, and is a remarkable platform for sharing ideas and building partnerships across disciplines, institutions, and borders. It stands as a testament to the power of global collaboration.

  As a ""super connector"", Hong Kong proudly connects people, expertise, and opportunities from around the world to drive the development of genomic medicine together. We are all united by one shared mission: to translate the promise of genomic medicine into real and lasting benefits for patients and families.

  Genomic medicine represents one of the most exciting frontiers in modern healthcare. It is redefining how we understand, diagnose, and treat disease - driving progress from disease prevention early detection and precise diagnosis to personalised treatment, and groundbreaking advances in clinical trials and drug discovery.

  Recognising the profound potential of this field, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has made genomic medicine a key pillar of the city's journey to promote healthcare and innovation.

  We set up the Hong Kong Genome Institute in 2020. The Institute's vision statement is ambitious yet simple - to avail genomic medicine to all for better health and well-being. Over the years, with strong government support, the Institute has become a driving force linking clinical practice with cutting-edge science.

  At the centre of the Institute's work stands its flagship initiative - the Hong Kong Genome Project - the city's first large-scale whole-genome sequencing programme. The Project has at least three main goals: to build a comprehensive genome database for the Hong Kong population, to nurture a professional workforce in genomic medicine, and to set standards for genetic and genomic testing across the healthcare system.

  Through strong collaboration among the HKSAR Government, the Hospital Authority, and local universities, the Project has already recruited more than 53 000 participants. Indeed, this figure has already exceeded the original target of 50 000 participants, which was set from the Project's inception in 2021.

  The impact of this growing effort extends beyond Hong Kong. At present, human genome databases shared internationally are largely Caucasian-based, accounting for over 70 per cent of all the data involved. Through the Hong Kong Genome Project, Hong Kong is building a unique genome database rooted primarily in the Southern Chinese population. By expanding the representation of Asian genomic data, Hong Kong is not only closing a critical gap in global knowledge, but also opening up new possibilities for more knowledge generation.

  The genomic data, and clinical information, collected through the Project are de-identified and stored in the Hong Kong Genome Institute's bioinformatics analytical platform for access by authorised researchers. As the Project's database continues to grow, it will allow for more targeted participant stratification, accelerating the discovery of new drugs and the development of precision therapies.

  Looking ahead, the HKSAR Government will continue to support the Hong Kong Genome Institute as the Institute embarks on the next phase of work, pressing ahead with its 2025-2030 Strategic Plan. The Plan sets four priorities: to integrate genomic medicine into clinical care; to advance research in genomic science; to nurture talent in genomic medicine; and to enhance public genomic literacy and foster industry partnership.

  The Institute will expand the Hong Kong Genome Project, enrolling a further 60 000 to 70 000 participants over the next five years. This larger genome database will contribute to accelerating novel gene discoveries, driving medical innovations from new diagnostic tests to precision therapies, and strengthening collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry on new drug trials and pharmacogenomics.

  Turning scientific discoveries into practical applications will take centre stage in the Hong Kong Genome Institute's next phase of work. The Institute will forge partnerships with research institutions and industry leaders not only in Hong Kong, but across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and beyond, to advance - and bring to market - innovative genomics technologies and products.

  I am confident that many of you at today's Symposium will join - or continue to join hands with - the Hong Kong Genome Institute in realising the immense transformative potential of genomic medicine.

  And all these ongoing and future efforts of the Institute go hand in hand with the HKSAR Government's new initiatives to facilitate the development and application of biomedical innovations in Hong Kong. To name a few, such initiatives include reform of medical product regulation, the setting up of the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation, and the establishment of the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute to provide a one-stop clinical trial support platform.

  All in all, we are determined to strengthen Hong Kong's role as an international health and medical innovation hub. With high-quality and efficient healthcare systems, state-of-the-art research facilities and capabilities, strong support from our motherland, and extensive international connectivity, Hong Kong is well placed to drive new breakthroughs that enhance community well-being and contribute meaningfully to global health.

  Today's Symposium provides an excellent opportunity to reflect on these ambitions from the perspective of genomic medicine. It features five thematic panel discussions that will explore various key frontiers - from managing rare diseases and applying precision medicine, to addressing the legal and ethical dimensions of data sharing, driving innovations in health-record management, and harnessing the power of artificial intelligence.

  Following this Symposium, Hong Kong will have the honour of hosting the annual meeting of the RDI-LCRD over the next two days. This milestone underscores Hong Kong's role as a hub for global scientific exchanges and collaboration. It also reflects the international community's confidence in our city's research environment and clinical excellence.

  Before closing, to our distinguished guests from the Chinese Mainland and overseas who have travelled from near and far, I hope you find your stay in Hong Kong both enriching and enjoyable. Beyond scientific exchanges, I invite you to experience the city's vibrancy and its unique blend of East-meets-West culture.

  And to our local participants, I encourage you to build on the connections made today - to keep the dialogue going and work together to improve patient care and public health. I would also like to make a brief appeal to you, as members of Hong Kong’s professional and scientific community. On December 7, Hong Kong will hold the 2025 Legislative Council General Election. I encourage each of you - and your family members - to vote in the election, because the choices you make will shape the policies that foster research, healthcare, and the well-being of present and future generations.

  On that note, I wish the Symposium, as well as the RDI-LCRD's annual meeting, every success. Thank you."

Speech by FS at Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit (English only) (with photo),2025-11-17 11:36,2025-11-17 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700255.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit today (November 17):

Dr Emanuele Grimaldi (Chair of the International Chamber of Shipping), Your Excellencies, Ministers, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is a pleasure to welcome you all to the second Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit, co-hosted by the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, and the newly formed Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board.

  This important event brings together more than 300 global maritime leaders from some 30 economies for vital dialogue and collaboration. Your presence speaks to the global significance of the discussions here.

  I would like to thank the ICS for once again choosing Hong Kong to host this pivotal summit, casting a strong vote of confidence in us as an international maritime centre. Representing over 80 per cent of the world's merchant fleet, your leadership in shaping the global maritime agenda is unparalleled.

Building Resilience in an Age of Transformation

  The theme of this Summit - ""Building Resilience, Driving Growth and Investment"" - speaks directly to our moment. Global maritime trade is no doubt facing headwinds: geopolitical tensions, tariff escalations, and new trade barriers are reshaping shipping routes and disrupting established patterns. The UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) Review of Maritime Transport 2025 forecasts seaborne trade growth of merely 0.5 per cent this year, down from 2.2 per cent in 2024 - the slowest pace in years. Vessel rerouting has pushed ton-miles to record levels, forcing ships to travel longer distances at higher cost.

  Yet this is not necessarily a story of decline, but of transformation. Allow me to offer three observations.

Shifting maritime trade patterns

  First, in my view, geopolitics will reshape rather than weaken maritime trade flows. Consider China. It has stood as the world's largest manufacturing economy for 15 consecutive years, commanding close to 30 per cent of global manufacturing output. It has an industrial ecosystem spanning the entire classification of industrial categories recognised by the United Nations. Despite talk of supply chain diversification, no country possesses China's completeness, scale, efficiency or integrated capacity. Indeed, supply chain reconfiguration arising from trade tensions is creating a complementary, not substitutional, relationship across the region.

  While Southeast Asian nations are attracting more investments and manufacturing activities, in this process, they are reinforcing the two-way trade flow with China, in raw materials, components, semi-finished goods and finished products. As a matter of fact, China-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)trade reached a record of some US$690 billion in the first eight months of 2025. Hong Kong, as a key re-export hub, has witnessed substantial growth in this business.
 
  As a manufacturer, China will continue to demand vast quantities of raw materials and components from Southeast Asia, Africa and the Pacific (like Australia). Meanwhile, as a consumer market of 1.4 billion people with a rapidly expanding middle income group, China will drive continued growth in the import of food, fashion, electronics, and more.

  At the same time, Southeast Asia, with approximately 700 million people with a median age of 32, is experiencing a significant demographic dividend. More importantly, their incomes are rising substantially. By 2030, ASEAN will contribute 140 million new consumers, representing 16 per cent of the world's new consumer class.

  Beyond Asia, the broader Global South, currently accounting for 18 per cent of global GDP, is projected to grow at 4.2 per cent annually through 2029. By 2033, South-South trade is expected to approach US$14 trillion.

  I believe this economic dynamism will be reshaping maritime trade. Intra-regional trade is emerging as a powerful engine of growth. Intra-Asia container volumes are projected to reach more than 42 million TEUs (Twenty Equipment Unit) by 2028, representing 3.8 per cent growth per year, outpacing the global average.

  The maritime sector itself is evolving, too. Intra-regional trade is driving demand for smaller, fuel-efficient vessels optimised for short-sea shipping. Scheduling patterns are also shifting to accommodate new supply chains and regional trade growth. Bulk commodities remain dominant in seaborne trade, and containerised cargo - including consumer electronics, automotive components, and renewable energy products - is experiencing robust growth, particularly in intra-Asia routes.

Decarbonisation as both imperative and opportunity

  My second observation is that decarbonisation of maritime operations is both an imperative and opportunity. The IMO (International Maritime Organization) has set a target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from international shipping by 2050. This is not environmental aspiration alone. It is regulatory reality.

  To this end, the liner shipping industry is making substantial progress, with 79 per cent of the deadweight tonnage of container and vehicle carriers capable of operating on renewable fuels. Yet scaling green fuel production and creating financial mechanisms to support adoption remain challenging. It requires strong political commitment and cross-sectoral collaboration.

  The opportunity is substantial. Maritime decarbonisation represents a multi-trillion-dollar investment opportunity through 2050. The transition to zero-emission marine fuels could create up to 4 million jobs globally across the energy supply chain. Here in Hong Kong, we are embracing this. For example, we have published an Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering, positioning ourselves as a regional hub for sustainable fuel supply. Our goal is to provide bunkering services for green fuels to ocean-going vessels more than 60 times per year by 2030, involving over 200 000 tonnes of green maritime fuels.

Harnessing digital transformation

  My third observation is on technology's transformative power. Ports and global container lines are commonly deploying artificial intelligence, blockchain and advanced data analytics to improve operational efficiency, optimise routes, and reduce downtime and carbon emissions. This is where Hong Kong also comes in, with our vibrant technology and startup community. Many of them are pioneering innovations in smart logistics. They can play a role not only in supporting our own transformation but also in serving the broader region.

  Technology is also reshaping what is shipped and how. As consumer preferences shift and companies adopt new production methods, the mode of maritime trade also evolves. Consumers are now preferring sustainable, traceable products, driving demand for supply chain solutions that can verify environmental and social credentials in real time. Besides, the speed of technology adoption in operation and management will determine competitive success in this decade. Those who are able to digitalise their operations will reduce costs, capture market share, and be better able to meet the expectations of increasingly sophisticated customers and regulators.

Concluding remarks

  Ladies and gentlemen, the maritime industry stands at a pivotal moment. Geopolitical fragmentation, shifting patterns of global commerce, climate imperatives and technological advancement are formidable forces. Yet they create opportunity precisely because they demand agility, innovation and vision.

  Yes, the currents are shifting, and the waters may be uncharted. But like the explorers in the Age of Discovery, there lies tremendous opportunity for those with the vision to navigate with strategy, courage and conviction. I am convinced that the voyage ahead is one of extraordinary growth for those who are willing and ready.

  On this note, I wish you all a most rewarding Summit, and the best of health and business in the time ahead.

  And for those of you coming from afar, I would like to appeal to you: don’t just work, but enjoy the city. We have wonderful hiking trails, beaches, about 200 Michelin-recommended restaurants, great museums, and above all, we don’t impose duty on wine! And remember to shop till you drop! Thank you."

å°æ¬çè¬å¯§å¯é¨é· (Deputy Director-General of the Youth Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Ms Wan Ning), Mr Dave Chen (President of the Hong Kong Computer Society), Mr Andre Blumberg (Conference Chairperson of the HKICC 2025), Professor Jin Hai (Vice President of the China Computer Federation), Dr Albert Wong (Programme Chairperson of the HKICC 2025), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you all today at the HKICC 2025. The Conference has long served as a vital platform for cross-sector dialogue and technological advancement. This year's theme, ""Scaling AI Transformation Beyond Experimentation"", captures a timely and important leap in AI development.

 AI is evolving from exploratory initiatives to real-world applications, driving productivity, resilience and competitiveness across sectors. In addition to the national proposal of the ""AI+"" initiative last year, the 15th Five-Year Plan announced last month reaffirms our country's support for Hong Kong to develop as an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre. With national support and a strategic foundation in place, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government is committed to contributing to the country's prosperity by building an AI ecosystem where innovation flourishes, collaboration deepens and impact lasts.

 The HKSAR Government took a number of moves to accelerate the conversion of AI concepts into impactful applications. A key milestone is the establishment of Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre (AISC) in late 2024, which will further be ramped up this year to meet the growing demand for high-performance computing power. We hope that this AISC will provide the necessary infrastructure for R&D (research and development) breakthroughs to be transformed into scalable business solutions for enterprises. We have also put in place the AI Subsidy Scheme to enable easier access for local research institutions and companies to these supercomputing resources.

 Furthermore, the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute will be established next year to serve as Hong Kong's dedicated AI institution. The Institute will focus on the full development cycle, from upstream research to midstream transformation, as well as downstream industry adoption. We are also going to enhance the Digital Transformation Support Pilot Programme to assist eligible small and medium-sized enterprises in adopting off-the-shelf AI solutions in their daily operations.

 In parallel, the Government is accelerating the development of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Co-operation Zone (Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone) in the Loop (Hong Kong Park), where AI is positioned as one of the key pillar industries. To facilitate scientific research and AI application testing, we are actively exploring with the relevant Chinese Mainland authorities the expansion of the cross-boundary flow of research data from the Chinese Mainland to Hong Kong for use by enterprises and organisations in the Hong Kong Park. We believe the establishment of a cross-boundary data flow management mechanism will facilitate safe and convenient flow of data between the two places.

 In addition, a 10-hectare site at Sandy Ridge in the Northern Metropolis will be developed into a high-tier data facility cluster, providing advanced computing infrastructure to support data-intensive innovation across AI and data-driven industries. This will further strengthen Hong Kong's position as a regional digital infrastructure hub, and advance the development of a digital economy and smart city initiatives.

 Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong's AI journey is entering a new chapter. As we lay the infrastructural foundation and provide the necessary policy support, we call for collective efforts from across sectors to build the future of Hong Kong AI development, and participants of today's Conference are definitely our key partners on this front.

 Before I close, may I invite all registered voters to cast your vote on the polling day on December 7. My sincere gratitude goes to the Hong Kong Computer Society for bringing together this impactful event. I wish the HKICC 2025 another year of great success! Thank you."

 Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you all today at the HKICC 2025. The Conference has long served as a vital platform for cross-sector dialogue and technological advancement. This year's theme, ""Scaling AI Transformation Beyond Experimentation"", captures a timely and important leap in AI development.

 AI is evolving from exploratory initiatives to real-world applications, driving productivity, resilience and competitiveness across sectors. In addition to the national proposal of the ""AI+"" initiative last year, the 15th Five-Year Plan announced last month reaffirms our country's support for Hong Kong to develop as an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre. With national support and a strategic foundation in place, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government is committed to contributing to the country's prosperity by building an AI ecosystem where innovation flourishes, collaboration deepens and impact lasts.

 The HKSAR Government took a number of moves to accelerate the conversion of AI concepts into impactful applications. A key milestone is the establishment of Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre (AISC) in late 2024, which will further be ramped up this year to meet the growing demand for high-performance computing power. We hope that this AISC will provide the necessary infrastructure for R&D (research and development) breakthroughs to be transformed into scalable business solutions for enterprises. We have also put in place the AI Subsidy Scheme to enable easier access for local research institutions and companies to these supercomputing resources.

 Furthermore, the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute will be established next year to serve as Hong Kong's dedicated AI institution. The Institute will focus on the full development cycle, from upstream research to midstream transformation, as well as downstream industry adoption. We are also going to enhance the Digital Transformation Support Pilot Programme to assist eligible small and medium-sized enterprises in adopting off-the-shelf AI solutions in their daily operations.

 In parallel, the Government is accelerating the development of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Co-operation Zone (Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone) in the Loop (Hong Kong Park), where AI is positioned as one of the key pillar industries. To facilitate scientific research and AI application testing, we are actively exploring with the relevant Chinese Mainland authorities the expansion of the cross-boundary flow of research data from the Chinese Mainland to Hong Kong for use by enterprises and organisations in the Hong Kong Park. We believe the establishment of a cross-boundary data flow management mechanism will facilitate safe and convenient flow of data between the two places.

 In addition, a 10-hectare site at Sandy Ridge in the Northern Metropolis will be developed into a high-tier data facility cluster, providing advanced computing infrastructure to support data-intensive innovation across AI and data-driven industries. This will further strengthen Hong Kong's position as a regional digital infrastructure hub, and advance the development of a digital economy and smart city initiatives.

 Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong's AI journey is entering a new chapter. As we lay the infrastructural foundation and provide the necessary policy support, we call for collective efforts from across sectors to build the future of Hong Kong AI development, and participants of today's Conference are definitely our key partners on this front.

 Before I close, may I invite all registered voters to cast your vote on the polling day on December 7. My sincere gratitude goes to the Hong Kong Computer Society for bringing together this impactful event. I wish the HKICC 2025 another year of great success! Thank you."

Test results and WSD's follow-up work regarding water supply incident affecting some Taikoo Shing residents,2025-11-16 23:50,2025-11-17 00:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600776.htm,"Regarding the appearance of black particles in the drinking water of some buildings in Taikoo Shing, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) had earlier collected water samples from some households, sump and roof drinking water tanks for testing. A spokesman for the WSD stated tonight (November 16) that the analysis has just been completed, showing that all water samples have met Hong Kong Drinking Water Standards. The small amount of black particles found in the samples were confirmed to be bitumen. It is believed that water pressure changes caused by WSD's temporary redirecting of water supply near Taikoo Shing last night stirred up bitumen sediments inside the pipes. These sediments are inert substances and pose no harm to human health.

The spokesman said that the WSD had already issued a press release earlier today explaining the cause of the incident (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600466.htm), adding that the damaged filter at the estate's public water inlet was repaired last night, and pipe flushing has been strengthened. To minimise inconvenience to residents, the WSD, together with the estate's property management company, arranged for cleansing of the sump drinking water tanks of affected buildings starting tonight at off-peak water usage hours (around 12:30am), expected to finish by dawn. Cleansing of roof drinking water tanks will follow tomorrow morning during off-peak water usage hours, with completion expected within the day. After these follow-up actions, the situation of black particles in drinking water is expected to improve significantly.

Further investigation showed that the affected buildings are mainly in phases four and five, totalling 14 blocks, about 20 per cent of the estate. WSD staff have been dispatched to work with the property management office to assist residents in flushing water meters and water heater inlets. As of 9pm today, about 100 water meters have been flushed, and more than 20 technicians have been arranged to flush electric water heater inlets. These actions will continue tomorrow.

To reassure residents, the WSD will continue to place water trucks and tanks in the estate to provide temporary water supply services, and set up a service counter and work together with the property management office to answer residents' enquiries immediately. If residents notice abnormalities in their drinking water, they should notify the management office at once or call the WSD customer service hotline at 2824 5000, and arrangements will be made promptly for follow-up.

The spokesman added that to prevent occurrence of similar incidents in the future, the WSD will not only conduct routine regular inspections of the estate's inlet filters, but also check the filters before and after pipe maintenance works to ensure they remain in good condition and can effectively block sediments stirred up during such works."

發言人表示，水務署今日較早時已就事件起因發出新聞公布（https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600356.htm )，並交代屋苑公共水管入水口的破損濾網設施昨晚已完成修復，並已加強沖洗水管。此外，為減少事件對居民帶來的不便，水務署聯同屋苑物業管理公司已安排於今日晚上非繁忙用水時間（約凌晨12時30分）開始清洗各受影響大廈的地下食水貯水缸，預料清晨完成，繼而在明日早上非繁忙用水時間後開始清洗各受影響大廈的天台食水貯水缸，預計相關清洗工作於明日內完成。經上述跟進行動後，相信食水出現黑點的情況會大有改善。

發言人表示，進一步調查顯示受影響座數主要來自第四期及第五期共14座大廈，佔總座數約兩成。署方已派員與物業管理處一同跟進及協助居民沖洗水錶及熱水爐的入水位。截至今日晚上九時，署方已安排並完成沖洗約100個處所的水錶，亦已安排20多個技工到場沖洗電熱水爐的入水位，相關行動明日會繼續。

為讓居民更安心，署方會繼續在屋苑放置水車及水箱以提供臨時供水服務，以及於屋苑設立服務站，與物業管理處一同即時解答居民查詢。如居民發現食水出現異常，請立即通知管理處，或致電本署客戶服務熱線2824 5000，我們會盡快安排專人聯絡及跟進。

發言人表示，為避免同類事件再次發生，水務署除日常定期檢查屋苑入水口的濾網，亦會在進行水管維修工程之前及之後再次檢查濾網的狀況，確保濾網狀況保持良好，能有效阻隔因水管維修工程而被揚起的沉積物。"

政制及內地事務局局長：謝謝大家。今日下午是我們選委界別的選舉論壇，整體來說我們的安排及各方面，我們都覺得是暢順的，包括50位候選人都全數出席，這不但顯示大家非常重視這個論壇，亦很重視這個機會，向他們的選民——選委去介紹自己的政綱和參選情況。同時，我們在現場看到，各選委與候選人之間的互動都是很良好的，充分顯示到團結和友好的選舉氛圍。我們亦都看到打氣團隊的氣氛亦相當好、很熱烈，同時亦井然有序。最難得的是，我們看到今次有超過1 100名選委參加這個論壇，看到大家都非常重視這次選舉，亦很熱切地希望了解各個候選人的情況，從而作出投票的選擇。整體來說，包括氣氛和安排上，我們覺得已經達致預期效果，亦能夠讓各個候選人闡述他們的政綱和理念，讓各位選委考慮。多謝大家。

記者：首先想問，今次的論壇一次過讓50位候選人參與，都是講述政綱，沒有回應問題時間，其實這還算是一個論壇嗎？為何會有這個設定？第二，想問每位候選人都有兩分半鐘時間發言，但剛才看見的情況是，其實很多候選人都講不完，甚至剛剛有候選人說因為時間緊迫而要精簡地説。這樣理想嗎？

政制及內地事務局局長：我們已說過，這39場論壇都會因應實際情況而制定和考慮整體安排。因應這次的選委界別，因為我們始終希望論壇，第一，會是一氣呵成的，因為如果組織幾次的話，由於選委有接近1 500名，要他們在同一時間出現，大家的公務都比較繁忙，所以我們希望能夠可以一次過安排。否則的話，（選委）有些場次可能會來，有些場次可能不來，這可能會造成不公的情況。在這個情況下，亦因應時間上的考慮，如果時間過長的話，也未必是個很理想的安排。所以，因應種種的因素，我們設定了今次這個環節是這樣安排，亦看見他們（候選人）都可以充分地講述他們的政綱以至抱負等各方面，這亦達致我們希望令選委更加了解他們的情況的這個目標。

記者：局長，去到尾段有不少選委離場，會否覺得對之後的候選人有不公平的情況出現？又想請教，我們都見到在選委區的座席上，有些並不是選委的人坐在那裏觀看，我想問問這是否符合局方本身的要求和安排呢？

政制及內地事務局局長：首先，我看到現場，而大家也看到，本身人數都相當多，正如我所講，有差不多1 100名選委出席這個論壇。當然，大家都知道選委他們本身很多時候公務都是很繁忙的，他是否會一直觀看到最後論壇結束，這要視乎實際情況以及他本身的工作時間。但問題是，就算他因事要提前離開都好，我們有提供「節目重溫」，他亦可以重看往後環節中候選人的情況，可以充分重看。的而且確，有部分選委很想了解候選人的情況，但因為時間上未必能夠親身參與，他們之前都有跟我們說過，希望可以由部分代表或者助理來到現場，聽完後再把情況轉述，從而讓他了解情況，亦有這種情況，我們都歡迎。總之可以有機會讓候選人充分地講述他們的政綱，令選委能夠充分了解，我們覺得都可以作一些彈性安排。

記者：剛才打氣環節時，五組一起（打氣），出現「疊聲」，大家聽不清楚，這個情況會不會覺得有更好的改善空間呢？第二條問題，今次邀請了選委和打氣團，但一般市民不能出席。為甚麼不邀請市民出席？會否使互動感欠缺一點？

政制及內地事務局局長：首先第一件事，我們經常說，每一個論壇我們都會因應實際情況，包括場地和時間各方面，再整體作一個設計安排。在打氣方面，雖然不是（每位候選人各有）一個獨立的打氣時間，因為時間都是一個考慮因素。如果時間過長，亦可能會影響觀眾出現疲勞的情況。所以我們的整體安排就是這樣，我們會一次性去看看情況。另一方面，我們覺得（這樣安排）氣氛會更濃厚，我們看到舉牌和候選人號碼等，各方面都可以清楚展示到候選人的打氣情況。就這一點，我認為今次的論壇已達到預期的目標。

當然，在任何情況下，我們都會因應情況作出優化。接着仍有多場論壇，我們會根據情況再作考慮。另外，剛才大家都看到，基本上現場已經滿座。選委、候選人及打氣團，基本上已坐滿整個場地。我們亦常常說，我們有現場直播，亦提供「節目重溫」，各位市民可以透過這些去了解情況。

記者：有兩條問題想問，首先想問（選舉委員會界別論壇）與地區直選的論壇相比，少了一個候選人在台上互動的環節，這樣會不會令選民對於候選人的理念、彼此的理念認知未夠深刻？另外想追問，昨日有候選人不適送院，大會說會聯絡他們跟進，最新的跟進情況是怎樣？會否造成不公，或者會提供時間讓她補回政綱、理念？

政制及內地事務局局長：基本上這都是與我剛才的說法一樣，每一場論壇都會因應其實際情況，包括場地或候選人的數目，這些都要考慮，時間亦是需要考慮的。我們就今次的選舉論壇安排了三小時進行，共有50位候選人，如果環節的數目太多，或者時間太長的話，這亦未必符合實際情況。所以我們覺得就這次安排來說，都可以讓參選人有機會將其政綱及各方面的想法向選委交代，這已經達致我們的目標。

記者：關於昨天有候選人暈倒的情況？

政制及內地事務局局長：關於昨天身體不適的候選人，我們很高興從她的個人Facebook得知，她的身體現時已沒有很大問題，我希望她可以早日康復。同時，我們亦會待她的身體狀況好轉時聯絡她，視乎她的意願，如有需要我們可以作出相關安排。謝謝大家。"
