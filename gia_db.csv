"Government continues to strengthen efforts in mosquito control and elimination, publicity and education in view of imported chikungunya fever case (with photos)",2025-08-07 22:45,2025-08-07 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700846.htm,"To ensure effective implementation of measures reducing the risk of transmission of chikungunya fever (CF), the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), together with relevant government departments and stakeholders, continue to strengthen efforts in mosquito control and elimination, publicity and education. In response to the imported CF cases announced yesterday (August 6), the Acting Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong, and Assistant Director of the FEHD Mr Peter Poon today (August 7) visited several places, including the area outside of Mount Haven in Tsing Yi North, Kwai Tsing District, to review the immediate response measures in the area to reduce the risk of secondary spread of CF. They also visited Ma Wan in Tsuen Wan District to learn more about the specific follow-up actions of various government departments and stakeholders to mitigate mosquito infestation.

 Meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts were held in July to formulate strategies and operations with relevant government departments and stakeholders. During today's visit, the EEB and the FEHD reminded all relevant departments to step up efforts in mosquito control and elimination, publicity and education amidst the recent rainy weather. In addition, the Panel on Food Safety and Environmental Hygiene will discuss preventive and control measures against mosquitoes and CF on August 12. The Government will take into consideration views from stakeholders and residents in its future measures. The FEHD and the Property Management Services Authority will jointly hold a large-scale seminar for the property management sector on August 19. The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health and the FEHD will provide participants with the latest information on CF and details of measures on mosquito control and elimination.

 Two of the imported cases announced yesterday travelled to Bangladesh and developed symptoms there. They returned to Hong Kong on August 3. Both patients live in Kwai Tsing District. The survey area in Tsing Yi North, where their residence is located, recorded a gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes of 15.5 per cent in July this year, which is at Level 2 alert level, indicating a fairly extensive distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. In response to the imported cases, the FEHD has immediately commenced vector investigations and targeted mosquito control within 250-metre radius of their residence. Measures include removing mosquito breeding grounds, applying larvicides to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and conducting ultra-low volume fogging operations in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes. In addition, the FEHD, jointly with other stakeholders including the Housing Department, District Council members, Community Care Teams and property management companies, held a health talk this morning to answer the residents' enquiries.

 The FEHD staff, representatives of housing estates, persons in charge of nearby hillside construction sites, and related pest control service contractors also provided detailed information on the actions taken and the ongoing work for mosquito control and prevention in public places, housing estates and construction sites. Furthermore, the FEHD convened a meeting of the inter-departmental task force on anti-mosquito work in Kwai Tsing District on July 28. Members of the task force include relevant departments and stakeholders and they will continue to collaborate and carry out related work.

 The FEHD has also been closely monitoring mosquito infestation situations in various districts. The gravidtrap index in the survey area of Ma Wan in Tsuen Wan District was 24.4 per cent in July this year, reaching a Level 3 alert level, indicating an extensive distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. A meeting of the inter-departmental task force on anti-mosquito work in Tsuen Wan District was held by the FEHD on July 24. Members of the task force include relevant departments and stakeholders. Targeted and sustained mosquito prevention and control operations at high-risk locations have been carried out based on the gravidtrap index in Ma Wan at the time.

 The EEB, the FEHD, the District Officer (Tsuen Wan), Mr Billy Au, representatives of related departments, housing estates, theme park, Rural Committees and community members have been conducting joint inspections in areas under their purview to strengthen mosquito prevention and control work. This includes eliminating mosquito breeding places, applying larvicides, conducting fogging operations to eradicate adult mosquitoes, and ensuring that mosquito trapping devices at appropriate locations are operating properly. Various parties and residents are willing to co-operate and provide support. With the concerted efforts of all parties, the situation of mosquito infestation in the survey area improved in the second half of July compared to the first half.

 In recent months, the district offices of FEHD continue to work closely with relevant departments and stakeholders to strengthen inspections, particularly targeting construction sites and locations with higher mosquito infestation risks. Actions include strengthening the clearance of stagnant water and the application of larvicides such as temephos sand granules to stagnant water cannot be cleared immediately, as well as conducting ultra-low volume fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes. Through publicity and educational work, the FEHD, relevant departments and stakeholders continue to appeal to members of the public to inspect and remove stagnant water at home to prevent and control mosquito infestation.

 In addition to the inspections mentioned above, the FEHD staff, along with related departments and stakeholders, will conduct inspections at different places (including Southern District on Hong Kong Island and Kai Tak North in Kowloon City) today and tomorrow to follow up on related works.

 The effectiveness of mosquito control relies on the concerted efforts and active participation of stakeholders from various sectors, including pest control operators in both public and private sectors, venue management and the general public, to prevent CF."

CHP announces no new confirmed chikungunya fever infection cases today (with photos),2025-08-07 20:12,2025-08-07 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700703.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 7) said that no new confirmed chikungunya fever (CF) infection cases had been recorded as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the CF case in recent days. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

A total of four CF cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year, all of which were imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

The DH has enhanced publicity and education efforts regarding CF targeting different groups. The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures, and also distributes leaflets to travellers. The Port Health Division staff members conducted inspections yesterday (August 6) and today respectively at the Lok Ma Chau Control Point and in the vicinity of the Hong Kong International Airport Ground Transportation Centre, and reminded the cross-boundary coach companies operators and the Airport Authority Hong Kong to strengthen anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division also conduct temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fever or related symptoms will be assessed for their health condition and referred to hospitals for follow-up when necessary.

To raise the awareness of the elderly on preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at the health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres, and remind residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. As of yesterday, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH has incorporated information of CF prevention into 296 health promotion activities provided to the elderly and their carers. In addition, the Elderly Health Service has arranged for the distribution of relevant leaflets at Elderly Health Centres across the 18 districts, with a view to helping the elderly to learn about the symptoms of CF and enhance their awareness of prevention of CF. The Family Health Service has also advised pregnant women and infant carers at its Maternal and Child Health Centres about precautions for preventing CF. The Student Health Service will distribute promotional leaflets to students at its Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres so that students could learn more about symptoms of CF.

The CHP today issued another letter to all doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong regarding CF to provide them with the latest epidemiological information and appeal them to watch out for CF-related symptoms among those who return to Hong Kong from outbound travel to affected areas. If there are suspected CF cases, they should immediately refer the patients to hospitals for treatment and reported to the DH in accordance with the established mechanism so that the DH can initiate epidemiological investigations, and implement prevention and control measures. Moreover, for patients with typical clinical symptoms of CF, irrespective of their travel history, doctors should consider to arrange testing based on clinical judgment.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public to adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. If members of the public return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. They should closely observe their personal health condition, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrangement of appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms, as it may lead to a serious and potentially fatal complication called ""Reye's syndrome"".

The CHP recommends that the public properly use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients to effectively prevent mosquito bites. The following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535, picaridin etc. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has intensified anti-mosquito measures at the residence of the confirmed patients and the locations visited after the onset of illness. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces as well as removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and alsoMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
衞生防護中心公布今日沒有新增基孔肯雅熱個案（附圖）,2025-08-07 19:22,2025-08-07 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700655.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月七日）表示，中心截至今日下午五時，沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心會繼續就近日錄得的基孔肯雅熱個案加強監測。市民不論在本地或外遊，均應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。避免蚊子叮咬和防止蚊蟲滋生是有效預防基孔肯雅熱的方法。

本港今年累計錄得四宗基孔肯雅熱個案，全部為輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為輸入個案。

衞生署已加強對不同群組有關基孔肯雅熱的宣傳教育工作。中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施，並向旅客派發宣傳單張。港口衞生科人員昨日（八月六日）及今日分別到落馬洲出入境管制站及香港國際機場地面運輸中心附近範圍視察，並提醒跨境巴士公司營辦商及機場管理局加強防控蚊患措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會為抵港人士進行體溫篩查，為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，並在有需要時轉介他們到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。截至昨日，衞生署長者健康服務外展分隊已在296個為長者及照顧者提供的健康推廣活動加入預防基孔肯雅熱的資訊。此外，長者健康服務亦安排在十八區的長者健康中心派發相關的單張，讓長者了解其症狀及加強防患基孔肯雅熱的意識。家庭健康服務亦在轄下的母嬰健康院提醒孕婦及嬰幼兒照顧者有關預防基孔肯雅熱的注意事項。學生健康服務會在轄下的學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心向學生派發宣傳單張，讓他們了解基孔肯雅熱的症狀。

中心今日亦再次就基孔肯雅熱去信全港醫生和醫院，以提供最新流行病學資訊，並呼籲他們留意從受影響地區外遊回港的求診人士是否有基孔肯雅熱相關病徵。如發現懷疑病例，應即時轉介病人入院治理，並按既定機制向衞生署呈報，以展開流行病學調查及防控工作。此外，對於出現基孔肯雅熱典型臨床症狀的患者，不論是否有旅行史，醫生應根據臨床判斷考慮安排檢測。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況，留意發燒、關節痛或皮疹等症狀。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節，以便醫生作出臨床診斷，並按個別病人情況安排適當檢測。市民切勿自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

中心建議市民使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食物環境衞生署（食環署）已加強確診病人的住所及於病發後曾到訪地點的防蚊滅蚊工作。同時，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

Key themes of the Forum will also include the use of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies and innovations in the energy transition, decarbonisation of heavy industry, sustainable supply chains, financing solutions for biodiversity and adaptation, as well as the latest trends in energy transition investment in the region.

  ""Emerging markets in the Asia-Pacific region recognise the necessity of leading, designing and investing in their own country-specific climate solutions, and they also recognise that working with the private sector to mobilise the capital and innovation they need is indispensable for smart development and job creation,"" said Regional Vice President for Asia Pacific, IFC, Riccardo Puliti.

  He added, ""Using our convening power alongside like-minded and valued partners as the HKMA and BloombergNEF, our Knowledge Partner, we're delighted to co-host this second edition of the Climate Business Forum: Asia Pacific, the cornerstone event of the second edition of Hong Kong Green Week.""

  ""Hong Kong is committed to supporting low-carbon, inclusive and resilient growth in Asia-Pacific,"" said the Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue. ""It is our pleasure to host the Climate Business Forum: Asia Pacific in Hong Kong for the second consecutive year, bringing together thought leaders from both financial and real sectors to explore viable solutions to our shared climate challenges. We are also excited to share Hong Kong's experience in mobilising sustainable finance and supporting the sustainable transformation of supply chains and developing nature-smart solutions, among other important topics.""

The one-day Forum will feature keynote addresses, high-level panels and fireside chats with corporate leaders, financiers, development partners and policymakers. It will also highlight transformative partnerships, including IFC's She Wins Climate initiative, which supports women entrepreneurs and women-led businesses active in delivering climate solutions, as well as the latest developmentsfrom the Alliance for Green Commercial Banks, a global initiative of IFC, in partnership in Asia with the HKMA.

The Forum builds on the success of its inaugural edition in 2024.

反非法勞工行動拘十四人（附圖）,2025-08-07 18:58,2025-08-07 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700647.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）近日展開一項反非法勞工行動，在行動中一共拘捕十四名人士，包括十二名懷疑非法勞工及兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。

入境處執法人員早前跟進調查在港逾期逗留人士時，懷疑他們留港期間在港從事非法工作。經深入調查及情報分析後，入境處於昨日（八月六日）採取執法行動，突擊搜查一個位於元朗區的物流倉庫。連同早前被捕的逾期逗留人士，共拘捕十二名懷疑非法勞工及兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為八男四女，年齡介乎二十四至五十三歲。他們均涉嫌於該物流倉庫從事搬運、包裝及裝卸貨物等工作。當中三名男子亦涉嫌管有懷疑偽造身份證，另外一名女子則涉嫌管有他人身份證。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為兩名香港居民男子，年齡分別為四十六及五十歲。行動中亦檢獲懷疑非法勞工的出勤紀錄、薪酬記錄、手提電腦及包裝工具。入境處將對非法勞工提出檢控，並繼續調查涉案僱主，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"
14 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operation (with photos),2025-08-07 18:58,2025-08-07 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700648.htm," The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted an anti-illegal worker operation recently. During the operation, 14 persons were arrested, namely 12 suspected illegal workers and two employers.

 During follow-up investigations of overstayers in Hong Kong earlier, the ImmD investigators suspected that these overstayers were engaged in illegal work during their stay in Hong Kong. After an in-depth investigation and intelligence analysis, the ImmD conducted an enforcement operation yesterday (August 6), raiding a logistics warehouse located in Yuen Long District. Together with the previously arrested overstayers, a total of 12 suspected illegal workers and two employers were arrested. The arrested illegal workers comprised eight men and four women, aged 24 to 53. They were all suspected of engaging in various logistics tasks, including handling, packaging, and unloading goods at the logistics warehouse. Among them, three men were also suspected of being in possession of forged Hong Kong identity cards, while one woman was suspected of possessing an identity card related to another person. Two men, aged 46 and 50, were Hong Kong residents suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested. During the operation, attendance records, payroll records, a laptop, and packaging tools of the illegal workers were also seized. The ImmD will lay charges against the arrested illegal workers while the cases involving the employers remain under investigation. The ImmD does not rule out the possibility of further arrests.

 An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

 The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged Hong Kong identity card or a Hong Kong identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

 The spokesman emphasised that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

 According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman reminded all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

   Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."

Speech by SCST at opening ceremony of ASEAN Film Festival 2025 (English only),2025-08-07 18:38,2025-08-07 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700643.htm," Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the opening ceremony of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Film Festival 2025 today (August 7):

Deputy Director Liu Guangyuan (Deputy Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)), Deputy Commissioner Pan Yundong (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the HKSAR), Consul-General Ong (Dean of ASEAN Consuls-General in Hong Kong, Consul-General of Singapore in Hong Kong, Mr Ong Siew Gay), Deputy Director Wan Ning (Deputy Director-General of the Youth Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR), Chairman Daryl Ng (Chairman of Hong Kong-ASEAN Foundation), Commissioner Nicholas Ho (Commissioner for Belt and Road), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. It is my pleasure to join you at the opening ceremony of the ASEAN Film Festival 2025.

Tonight, we come together to celebrate the transformative power of film - an art form that transcends borders, connects diverse cultures, and tells stories that resonate with people from all walks of life. This year's festival offers a curated lineup of over 20 acclaimed films, bringing remarkable stories from Southeast Asia to the Hong Kong audience. For the very first time, the festival also features outstanding works from four Belt and Road countries - Egypt, Hungary, Kazakhstan, and Türkiye - further enriching this cultural showcase. 

This festival serves as a unique platform for dialogues and collaborations. I'm pleased to see filmmakers, directors, and actors from some 10 featured films participating in special sharing sessions, engaging with local youth and ASEAN students in Hong Kong. There will also be two collaborative talks between ASEAN and Hong Kong filmmakers, bringing in insightful cross-cultural discussions, paving the way for new ideas and partnerships.

Such cultural exchange activities align perfectly with our strategic vision to establish Hong Kong as a leading East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. Moreover, the activities also underscore Hong Kong's steadfast dedication to strengthening connections with countries along the Belt and Road region, solidifying its role as the ""super-connector"" between the Mainland of China and the global community.

Creative industries are vital drivers of our economy, and the Hong Kong film industry stands as a flagship of our creative industry. I am sure many of you have grown up watching at least one or two Hong Kong films, enjoying TVB dramas, or listening to Canto pop hits. These treasures are truly some of the valuable cultural assets of Hong Kong that we are so proud of.

The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is committed to promoting the development of Hong Kong's film industry. Recently, we have launched the Film Production Grant Scheme for Promoting Chinese Culture, encouraging Hong Kong film directors to incorporate Chinese cultural elements into film productions. We also encourage Hong Kong filmmakers to collaborate with European and Asian filmmakers through the Hong Kong-Europe-Asian Film Collaboration Funding Scheme. Furthermore, Hong Kong film programmes are organised regularly in different countries to showcase Hong Kong's cinematic brilliance and to foster cultural exchange and collaboration. These efforts aim not only to bring diverse cultures to Hong Kong but also to share the richness of Chinese culture with the world.

Before I close, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Hong Kong-ASEAN Foundation for organising this wonderful event that furthers regional cultural exchange. I wish the ASEAN Film Festival 2025 every success and all of you an inspiring and enjoyable evening. Thank you very much."

Fresh beef sample found to contain sulphur dioxide,2025-08-07 18:32,2025-08-07 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700650.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (August 7) that a fresh beef sample was found to contain sulphur dioxide, a preservative which is not permitted to be used in fresh meat. The CFS is following up on the incident.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS, under its routine Food Surveillance Programme, took the fresh beef sample from a fresh provision shop (FPS) on Reclamation Street, Yau Ma Tei, for testing. The test result showed that the sample contained sulphur dioxide at a level of 557 parts per million. The CFS is following up with the FPS concerned about the irregularity.""

According to the Preservatives in Food Regulation (Cap. 132BD) (the Regulation), it is an offence to add sulphur dioxide to fresh or chilled meat. The maximum penalty is a $50,000 fine and six months' imprisonment.

Sulphur dioxide is a preservative which can be used in a variety of foods including dried vegetables, dried fruits, pickled vegetables and salted fish products, but under the Regulation it is not permitted in fresh or chilled meat. Individual meat traders have been found illegally using sulphur dioxide to make meat look fresher. Sulphur dioxide is water-soluble, and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However, susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties, headaches and nausea after consumption.

The spokesman reminded the food trade to comply with the law and not to sell fresh or chilled meat adulterated with sulphur dioxide. Members of the public should purchase meat from reliable market stalls or FPSs. They should avoid buying or consuming meat which is unnaturally red, and maintain a balanced diet to avoid malnutrition or excessive exposure to chemicals from a small range of food items.

The CFS will continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing."
新鮮牛肉樣本含二氧化硫,2025-08-07 18:31,2025-08-07 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700649.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（八月七日）公布，中心在一個新鮮牛肉樣本檢出不可在新鮮肉類中使用的防腐劑二氧化硫，正跟進事件。

中心發言人說：「中心透過恆常食物監測計劃，從油麻地新填地街一新鮮糧食店檢取該新鮮牛肉樣本進行化驗。結果顯示，樣本含百萬分之五百五十七的二氧化硫。中心正與涉事新鮮糧食店跟進有關違規事項。」

根據《食物內防腐劑規例》（第132BD章）（《規例》），在新鮮及冰鮮肉類中添加二氧化硫屬違法，最高可判罰款五萬元及監禁六個月。

二氧化硫是一種防腐劑，可用於乾菜、乾果、醃菜和鹽醃的魚製品等不同種類的食物，但根據《規例》不得用於新鮮或冰鮮肉類。個別販商為使肉類色澤更鮮明，會違法在肉類中添加二氧化硫。二氧化硫可溶於水中，清洗和烹煮可除去食物中大部分二氧化硫。不過，對二氧化硫有過敏反應的人，在食用後可能會出現氣喘、頭痛或噁心等徵狀。

發言人提醒業界必須遵守法例規定，不可售賣摻雜二氧化硫的新鮮及冰鮮肉類。市民則應向可靠的街市檔戶或新鮮糧食店購買肉類，切勿購買或進食顏色異常鮮紅的肉類，同時需注意均衡飲食，因為偏食可引致營養不良或攝取過多的化學物。

中心會繼續跟進事件和採取適當行動。調查仍然繼續。"

本次高峰會以區塊鏈等前沿科技賦能數字經濟為主題，聚焦如何通過標準化支持香港數字資產與穩定幣的創新發展，加速Web3.0產業的健康成長。代幣化作為全球金融科技的熱點，正深刻改變金融市場的運作方式。根據市場的研究報告指出，全球代幣化基金的資產管理規模已超過20億美元，預計到二○三○年將可能達到6,000億美元，約佔全球共同基金及ETF（交易所買賣基金）市場的百分之一。這一趨勢為香港帶來了前所未有的機遇，同時也伴隨着挑戰。

政府致力將香港打造成全球領先的數字資產中心，構建一個風險可控、創新蓬勃的市場環境，為實體經濟和金融市場創造實質效益。今天，我邀請各位與我一同探索如何平衡機遇與挑戰，推動香港成為Web3.0時代的領航者。

香港在代幣化領域已取得顯著成績，奠定了全球領先地位。早於二○二三年二月，政府發行了全球首筆八億港元的代幣化綠色債券，採用區塊鏈實現交付對支付結算，標誌着香港在綠色金融與代幣化的領導地位。今年二月，有金融機構推出了亞太地區首個零售代幣化貨幣市場基金，投資於港幣計價的短期存款和高質量貨幣市場工具，降低投資門檻，便利投資者參與，推動資產管理的數字化轉型。今年五月亦有銀行推出香港首個銀行主導的區塊鏈結算服務，支持企業客戶的港幣及美元即時支付和代幣化存款於貿易融資的應用，顯著提升跨境交易效率。這些案例展示了香港在代幣化領域的創新能力，為全球金融市場提供了可複製的範例。

《政策宣言2.0》：數字經濟的未來藍圖

為抓住數字資產及代幣化機遇，政府推出了《政策宣言2.0》（《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》），秉持「相同業務、相同風險、相同規則」的原則，勾畫前瞻性的策略，促進普惠金融、培養人才、保障投資者，並鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位。

優化法律與監管框架

政府持續與監管機構及業界持份者合作，制定全面的法律與監管框架以規管數字資產，確保香港數字資產生態圈能夠可持續且負責任地發展。該框架以保護投資者及消費者為核心，並涵蓋數字資產交易所、穩定幣發行人、數字資產交易服務提供者及數字資產託管服務提供者。由今年八月一日開始，穩定幣法案已經生效，為穩定幣發行人提供清晰監管框架，促進其在實體經濟上的應用。而數字資產交易服務提供者及數字資產託管服務提供者的公眾諮詢則正在進行，到這個月底便會結束。我在此賣個廣告，希望大家能踴躍發表意見。

擴展代幣化產品種類

除了我剛才提到關於法規的工作，《政策宣言2.0》有另一個角度，就是擴展代幣化產品的種類。政府還將定期發行代幣化政府債券，明確代幣化ETF的印花稅寬免，提升市場流動性，並研究貴金屬、有色金屬及可再生能源等多元化資產的代幣化應用，展示技術的廣泛應用潛力。

推進應用場景及跨界別合作

第三個方面是應用場景。為表達支持及起帶頭作用，政府歡迎市場參與者就政府可如何試驗及使用獲發牌的穩定幣提出建議。另外，數碼港亦已推出區塊鏈及數字資產試點資助計劃，為具有未來應用潛力、標誌性和具市場影響力的申請項目提供資金。

人才與合作夥伴發展

最後是人才的培育。政府與業界及學術界合作，通過聯合研究項目，培育新一代企業家、研究人員及技術專家，將香港定位為數字資產知識分享及國際合作的中心。

結語

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，香港的獨特優勢令我們在推動傳統金融步入數字資產時代方面盡佔先機。《政策宣言2.0》訂定的框架有助我們邁向我剛才說的四個方面，就是「LEAP」，形成一個值得信賴、可持續且深度融入實體經濟的數字資產生態圈。同時也讓香港站穩在數字轉型的前沿，為企業和投資者提供清晰路線圖，讓大家在穩健和發展蓬勃的數字資產市場運籌帷幄。我也祝願今天的大會圓滿成功。謝謝大家。"

It has also attracted numerous research institutions, including the City University of Hong Kong (Dongguan) and the Greater Bay Area University (Songshan Lake Campus), positioning itself at the forefront of national scientific research.

 To implement the co-operation between Hong Kong and Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone, InvestHK signed an MOU today by the Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK, Ms Alpha Lau, and Vice Mayor of the Dongguan Municipal People's Government and Secretary of the Party Working Committee of Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone, Mr Chen Qingsong, at InvestHK's head office. Representatives from both sides also had in-depth exchanges to further promote the deep integration of scientific research and industry between Dongguan and Hong Kong. Leveraging Hong Kong's advantages in international research network and intellectual property protection, combined with Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone's advanced manufacturing capabilities and comprehensive industrial infrastructure, both parties aim to jointly build a thriving innovation and technology ecosystem. As an international financial and trade centre, Hong Kong serves as both a gateway for bringing in global innovation, technology and capital to Dongguan and a springboard for supporting Dongguan enterprises in expanding into overseas markets.

 Prior to the signing ceremony, Ms Lau attended the listing ceremony of a renowned pharmaceutical company, Sunshine Lake Pharma, from Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This event highlighted the pathway for Mainland enterprises to access international markets through Hong Kong's capital markets. Since its establishment in 2000, InvestHK has assisted over 7 700 enterprises from the Mainland and around the world in setting up or expanding in Hong Kong, with more than 145 successfully listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

 Ms Lau said, ""As one of the national-level high-tech industrial development zones, Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone has not only developed numerous cutting-edge technologies and nurtured countless innovative talent but also serves as a crucial platform for promoting the transformation of scientific achievements and industrial upgrading. We believe that this co-operation can create a synergy effect from Hong Kong's international advantages and the innovative edge of Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone, helping enterprises and talent from the zone to shine on the global stage.""

 Mr Chen said, ""Dongguan and Hong Kong have a long history of co-operation. Today, under the guidance of the national development strategy for the GBA, the two cities are accelerating their collaborative development. This MOU signing will further stimulate the synergy effects of resource sharing and complementary advantages, deepen market connectivity, help more high-quality enterprises expand overseas, and jointly explore new opportunities for innovative co-operation.""

 According to the MOU, InvestHK will provide one-stop support for enterprises from Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone to leverage Hong Kong as a gateway to global markets. This includes facilitating access to international capital markets, matching them with world-class professional service partners, and offering support in areas such as office site selection, R&D implementation and talent acquisition. By integrating resources from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, InvestHK aims to provide comprehensive assistance to help enterprises expand financing channels and enhance the global influence of their brands and technologies. At the same time, both parties will establish a collaboration mechanism to pool policies, funding, and professional resources, promoting the industrialisation and commercialisation of innovative achievements and jointly creating an internationally competitive ecosystem for innovative enterprises.

 Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone also opened a Songshan Lake Science City Hong Kong Operations Centre yesterday (August 6) at the InnoCentre in Hong Kong. This initiative aims to foster collaboration and exchange between Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone and Hong Kong in the technology industry, actively supporting the major strategic deployment of the GBA. InvestHK's leadership team also attended the unveiling ceremony to explore new opportunities for deepening collaboration and exchange.

 Looking ahead, InvestHK will continue to work with Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone to deepen co-operation in areas such as innovation and entrepreneurship, talent exchange, and overseas expansion. Through collaborative efforts, the two parties aim to strengthen connection within the GBA, jointly creating a platform for enterprises to go global.

CAD engages in air traffic management technology trials with regional partners (with photo),2025-08-07 15:00,2025-08-07 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700266.htm,"âThe Director-General of Civil Aviation, Mr Victor Liu, visited the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) Innovation Lab and was updated on Flight and Flow Information for a Collaborative Environment (FF-ICE), Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO), as well as the latest developments of regional air traffic management projects today (August 7). He also took this opportunity to commend the CAD team on their successful participation in the inaugural Asia-Pacific Regional Laboratory Demonstration of TBO held in Hanoi, Vietnam, from July 22 to 24.

TBO is an advanced air traffic management (ATM) approach being promoted globally by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in line with the Global Air Navigation Plan to optimise flight operations and enhance trajectory management. Through System Wide Information Management, FF-ICE forms the foundation for TBO, enabling richer and more collaborative information such as flight trajectories, weather, airport operations and air traffic flow management information to be shared among airspace users and air navigation service providers (ANSPs) under the platform. This collaborative approach can help to optimise flight paths, thus effectively reducing flight time, fuel consumption and carbon emissions, making ATM and flight operations more efficient and environmentally friendly.

Since 2023, the CAD has been working closely with other ANSPs in the Asia-Pacific region on trial information exchanges for TBO. During the laboratory demonstration held in Hanoi, the CAD successfully showcased its FF-ICE prototype system developed in-house to the regional ANSPs, demonstrating the CAD's technological innovation and pioneer position in the field of future ATM development.

Mr Liu commended the team's dedication and encouraged them to continue to embrace and effectively apply new technologies and actively participate in regional collaboration. The CAD will continue to work closely with the ICAO and other ANSPs to further enhance ATM efficiency to accommodate future air traffic demand and growth in the Asia-Pacific region."

​房屋署回應申訴專員公署主動調查報告,2025-08-07 12:00,2025-08-07 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700216.htm,"就申訴專員公署今日（八月七日）發表「房屋署對公共屋邨的管理：冷氣機滴水」的主動調查報告，房屋署感謝公署肯定香港房屋委員會／房屋署在執管公共屋邨的冷氣機滴水問題的積極性，並主動採取優化措施，持續提升公共屋邨管理效能。

房屋署已實施多項措施針對公共屋邨冷氣機滴水事宜，包括早於二○○六年推行冷氣機去水管安裝計劃，為公屋單位裝置冷氣機去水管，方便租戶將冷氣機冷凝水排走；自二○○八年起將冷氣機滴水納入屋邨管理扣分制（扣分制）的規管，並透過日常巡查及特遣隊巡查跟進租戶冷氣機滴水的情況。此外，房屋署運用資訊科技，包括於屋邨推出「巡邏易」試驗計劃，讓前線護衞職員及樓宇監督透過專用手機程式實時報告冷氣機滴水的情況，以便迅速跟進；亦積極探討使用專業科技器材，協助查找滴水源頭。

房屋署接獲冷氣機滴水的投訴宗數已大幅下降百分之九十三，由二○○五年約18 900宗下降至二○二二至二○二四年每年平均約1 300宗，佔約80萬公屋租戶的0.16%，反映房屋署已實施的多項措施有效處理冷氣機滴水個案。

房屋署在二○二四年十二月起更進一步實施優化措施，給予租戶五天限期處理冷氣機出現滴水情況，否則會即時採取扣分制措施；並同時提升執管效能，所有公共屋邨的保安監督人員可即場向違規租戶發出「違例事項通知書」。房屋署會繼續加強職員培訓，以及對外判物業管理公司的監管。

此外，房屋署會繼續透過不同渠道加強公屋住戶的宣傳教育，提醒租戶定期保養和維修冷氣機。由於租戶有時候並不容易察覺自己單位的冷氣機滴水，房屋署鼓勵受影響的人士提供資料，攜手合作找出滴水源頭。

房屋署發言人說：「我們感謝公署對我們工作的肯定和認同，亦感謝公署對現行機制和措施提供寶貴意見。我們接納有關建議，並會繼續優化工作流程，從而及早發現並處理這些個案。」"
Housing Department responds to Ombudsman's direct investigation report,2025-08-07 12:00,2025-08-07 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700219.htm,"  Regarding a report released by the Office of the Ombudsman today (August 7) on its direct investigation into ""Housing Department's Management of Public Housing Estates: Air-conditioner Dripping"", the Housing Department (HD) expressed appreciation to the Ombudsman for recognising the pro-active attitude and initiative of the Housing Authority/HD in implementing enhancement measures in managing water dripping from air-conditioners in public housing estates to continuously improve the effectiveness of estate management.

  The HD has implemented multiple measures to address the issue of water dripping from air-conditioners in public housing estates. These include the launching of the Installation Programme of Condensation Drain-pipe for Air-conditioners in 2006 to put in place condensation drain pipes in public rental housing (PRH) flats to facilitate the discharge of condensation water from air-conditioners. Since 2008, water dripping from air-conditioners has been included in the Marking Scheme for Estate Management Enforcement in Public Housing Estates (Marking Scheme), with follow-up actions handled through daily patrols and inspections by special operation teams. In addition, the HD adopts information technology, including the trial use of the ""Mobile Application System for Daily Patrol"" which enables frontline security personnel and building supervisors to report cases of water dripping from air-conditioners in real time for swift follow-up actions. The HD is also actively exploring the use of professional technological equipment to assist in identifying the source of water dripping.

  The number of complaints regarding water dripping from air-conditioners received by the HD has significantly decreased by 93 per cent, from approximately 18 900 cases in 2005 to an average of about 1 300 cases per year from 2022 to 2024, accounting for 0.16 per cent of about 800 000 PRH households and clearly reflecting that the effectiveness of the multiple measures implemented by the HD in the handling of cases for water dripping from air-conditioners.

  The HD has further implemented enhanced measures in December 2024 by giving five days for concerned households to rectify any water dripping problem from their air-conditioners, failing which, action would be taken immediately under the Marking Scheme. Meanwhile, enforcement efficiency has been improved by allowing security supervisors in all public housing estates to issue ""Notification Slips"" to offending households on the spot. The HD will continue to strengthen staff training and supervision of outsourced property management companies.

  Furthermore, the HD will continue to strengthen publicity and education for PRH households through various channels, reminding residents to regularly maintain and repair air-conditioners. Since households sometimes may not be aware of water dripping from their air-conditioners, the HD encourages affected individuals to provide information and work together to identify the source of water dripping.

  ""We would like to thank the Ombudsman for the affirmation and recognition of our efforts, and appreciate its valuable views on the current mechanisms and measures. We accept the relevant recommendations and will continue to streamline our workflow, thereby ensuring such cases can be detected and addressed promptly,"" an HD spokesman said."
​申訴專員公署公布就房屋署處理公共屋邨冷氣機滴水的主動調查行動報告（附圖）,2025-08-07 11:00,2025-08-07 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080600678.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（八月七日）宣布公署完成房屋署處理公共屋邨冷氣機滴水的主動調查行動，並向房屋署提出共15項主要改善建議。

超過78萬住戶、約200萬居民居住於香港房屋委員會（房委會）轄下的195條公共屋邨。屋邨的日常管理由房屋署或其聘任的外判服務承辦商負責，管理範疇眾多，公屋管理是否妥善，屬重要民生事宜。繼公署今年三月完成有關公共屋邨違例泊車的主動調查行動後，是項主動調查行動處理的是冷氣機滴水。

陳積志表示：「房屋署多年來做了大量相關工作，透過推行冷氣機去水管安裝計劃以及將冷氣機滴水不當行為納入屋邨管理扣分制，成功將冷氣機滴水的問題大幅改善。房屋署收到的投訴，由二○○五年的約18 900宗下降至近三年（即二○二二至二○二四年）每年平均約1 300宗，下降幅度高達93%，工作成果值得肯定和讚賞。」

然而，冷氣機滴水滋擾始終是每年夏天的常見問題，房屋署有責任更妥善處理，為居民締造衞生和優質的居住環境。現時房委會轄下的公共屋邨之中，約三分之二的物業管理工作由房屋署聘任的外判服務承辦商承辦（外判邨），其餘三分之一則由房屋署直接管理（直管邨）。

外判邨與直管邨於二○二二至二○二四年期間，分別接獲2 826宗和1 049宗冷氣機滴水投訴。外判邨的冷氣機滴水投訴個案數字從二○二二年至二○二四年上升45.5%，而直管邨的冷氣機滴水投訴個案數字則上升20.1%。於二○二四年，外判邨的重複投訴佔10.6%，而直管邨則為6.3%。這些數字均顯示直管邨情況較佳，而外判邨的投訴升幅或重複投訴百分比，均表現稍遜。若以投訴所佔戶數計算，外判邨的冷氣機滴水投訴個案數字，於二○二二年、二○二三年及二○二四年0.17%、0.20%和0.24%﹔而直管邨於該三年接獲投訴的宗數則佔0.12%、0.12%和0.14%。

扣分制下的不當行為可分為先警告後扣分及即時扣分兩類，冷氣機滴水屬先警告後扣分的違規事項。公署發現，就冷氣機滴水個案，房屋署的外判服務承辦商在執行扣分制之前，不時會向違規租戶發出僅屬勸諭性質的提示信，而公署查訊及調查初期，房屋署沒有為發出提示信制訂指引。在二○二二至二○二四年期間，外判邨的外判服務承辦商就每宗投訴平均發出兩封提示信，數目超過直管邨的十倍。有個案顯示，外判服務承辦商多次發出提示信，未能有效令違規租戶糾正冷氣機滴水的問題。而由於由房屋署聘任的外判服務承辦商未必須向房屋署呈報提示信數目，該署無法確定外判服務承辦商有否濫發提示信或對冷氣機滴水個案處理不當。

公署調查亦發現，房屋署有關處理冷氣機滴水個案的工作指引比較簡略，只列明執行扣分制的程序，但未有詳述前線人員應如何調查投訴、確定滴水源頭、測試冷氣機及所需時間、處理租戶不合作的情況、安排覆查等。公署認為，正如部分個案顯示，在欠缺適切指引下，前線職員或會處理不一。

公署欣悉，在公署查訊及調查期間，房屋署於二○二四年十二月實施扣分制加強措施，例如統一勸諭信、給予一律五天的寬限期，以及就發出勸諭信及跟進行動訂立指引等。

陳積志表示：「民生無小事，冷氣機滴水可能造成環境衞生滋擾，亦有可能產生噪音滋擾。從屋邨管理角度而言，房屋署有責任貫徹執行扣分制，遏止冷氣機滴水問題及如有相關投訴應盡快解決。公署認為，房屋署無法確定其外判服務承辦商有否濫發提示信及處理不一的情況並不理想。公署建議，房屋署應研究制訂有關發出勸諭信和報告個案的監管措施，加強對其外判服務承辦商的監管，以及研究如何更有系統記錄冷氣機滴水投訴個案的詳情及跟進行動。房屋署亦應加強工作指引，並加快引入創新科技，強化查找冷氣機滴水源頭的能力。此外，公署亦建議房屋署考慮與其他政府部門（例如食物環境衞生署（食環署））協作，就不同範疇互相交流經驗。」

整體而言，公署提出共15項主要改善建議。公署欣悉，房屋署同意公署提出的所有改善建議。

公署向房屋署提出的主要改善建議包括：

• 研究制訂有關發出勸諭信和報告個案的監管措施，加強對由房屋署聘任的外判服務承辦商的監管；

• 研究如何更有系統記錄冷氣機滴水投訴個案的詳情及跟進行動，以便利監管；

• 考慮優化處理冷氣機滴水個案的工作指引，讓屋邨管理人員可更清晰及有效工作﹔

• 於工作指引明確訂明前線人員應如何調查滴水源頭，包括在沒有其他方式核實的情況下，例如當無法從外觀察確定滴水源頭，盡可能進入懷疑滴水的單位測試冷氣機，並訂定冷氣機測試的時間標準，以及找不到滴水源頭的話，其後續跟進的程序；

• 就處理未能鎖定滴水源頭的情況，訂立工作指引和制訂指定格式的通告文件﹔

• 考慮要求由房屋署聘任的外判服務承辦商在每月報告標示發出勸諭信的數目，以及有否重複個案，以便較易察覺問題及跟進﹔

• 加快及繼續引入創新科技，強化查找冷氣機滴水源頭的能力；及

• 考慮與其他政府部門協作（例如食環署）探討可否配合進行大規模的巡查行動及宣傳教育活動，藉以增加迴響，提升市民妥善維修保養冷氣機的意識。

Office of The Ombudsman announces results of direct investigation operation into Housing Department's handling of air-conditioner dripping in public housing estates (with photo),2025-08-07 11:00,2025-08-07 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080600680.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (August 7) announced the completion of a direct investigation operation into the Housing Department (HD)'s handling of air-conditioner dripping in public housing estates, with 15 major recommendations for improvement made to the HD.

Over 780 000 households, comprising about 2 million residents, live in 195 public housing estates under the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA). The HD and its property services agents (PSAs) are responsible for the daily management of these estates, which encompasses a wide array of duties. Proper management of public housing is a crucial livelihood issue. Following the Office of The Ombudsman's direct investigation operation into illegal parking in public housing estates completed in March this year, this direct investigation operation deals with air-conditioner dripping.

Mr Chan said, ""Over the years, the HD has made extensive efforts to successfully alleviate the problem of air-conditioner dripping through the implementation of the air-conditioner drain-pipe installation programme, and inclusion of such misdeeds under the Marking Scheme for Estate Management Enforcement. The number of complaints received by the HD dropped by 93 per cent from around 18 900 in 2005 to an average of around 1 300 from 2022 to 2024. This remarkable accomplishment merits recognition and appreciation.""

However, air-conditioner dripping remains a typical problem every summer. The HD must step up its efforts to ensure a hygienic and quality living environment for residents. Among the public housing estates under HKHA, the property management of around two-thirds are outsourced to the HD's PSAs (known as outsourced estates), and the remaining one-third are directly managed by the HD (known as directly managed estates).

Between 2022 and 2024, outsourced and directly managed estates received 2 826 and 1 049 complaints respectively about air-conditioner dripping. During those years, related complaints rose by 45.5 per cent in outsourced estates and 20.1 per cent in directly managed estates. In 2024, 10.6 per cent of the complaints in outsourced estates were repeated complaints, compared to 6.3 per cent in directly managed estates. These figures reflect that directly managed estates outperformed outsourced estates, where outsourced estates had a higher increase in the number of complaints and a higher percentage of repeated complaints. In terms of the proportion of complaints over the number of households, outsourced estates recorded percentages of 0.17 per cent, 0.20 per cent and 0.24 per cent in 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively while directly managed estates recorded percentages of 0.12 per cent, 0.12 per cent and 0.14 per cent during the same period.
There are two categories of misdeeds under the Marking Scheme: those incurring a warning prior to the allotment of penalty points, and those resulting in an immediate point allotment. Air-conditioner dripping falls into the former category. The Office's investigation revealed that in air-conditioner dripping cases, the HD's PSAs often issued reminder letters to non-compliant tenants before enforcing the Marketing Scheme. These letters were merely advisory in nature. During the Office's inquiry and investigation, initially the HD had not yet formulated guidelines on issuing reminder letters. Between 2022 and 2024, the HD's PSAs issued an average of two reminder letters per complaint, which was more than tenfold of those issued in directly managed estates. There were cases which revealed that despite the repeated issuance of reminder letters, the dripping problem still occurred. As the HD's PSAs might not be required to report the number of reminder letters issued to the HD, the HD can hardly verify whether its PSAs are issuing too many reminder letters or mishandling air-conditioner dripping complaints.

The Office's investigation also found that the HD's operational guidelines for handling air-conditioner dripping cases are too brief, focusing only on the procedures for enforcing the Marking Scheme without clear instructions for frontline staff on such aspects as complaint investigations, source detections, air-conditioner testing and its duration, dealing with unco-operative tenants and arranging follow-up inspections. The Office considers the absence of proper guidelines might have resulted in inconsistent handling by frontline staff, as evidenced in some cases.

The Office is pleased to note that during its inquiry and investigation, the HD has, since December 2024, implemented enhanced measures under the Marking Scheme, such as launching standardised ""advisory letters"", granting a uniform grace period of five days and formulating guidelines for issuing advisory letters and follow-up actions etc.

Mr Chan said, ""Nothing about people's livelihoods is trivial. Air-conditioner dripping probably causes not only hygiene-related nuisances but also noise disturbances. From an estate management perspective, it is incumbent on the HD to thoroughly enforce the Marking Scheme in order to address the dripping problems and resolve such complaints promptly. The Office considers it undesirable for the HD to be unable to ascertain in the past whether its PSAs were issuing too many reminder letters and handling cases inconsistently. The Office recommends that the HD explore ways to formulate measures for monitoring the issuance of advisory letters and case reporting to strengthen its supervision of its PSAs, as well as to record the details and follow-up actions in relation to air-conditioner dripping complaints more systematically. The HD should also beef up its operational guidelines and expedite the adoption of innovative technologies to improve its ability to trace the sources of dripping. Furthermore, the Office recommends that the HD consider collaboration with other government departments (such as the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)) to foster exchanges of experiences across their respective areas of responsibility.""

Overall, the Office has made 15 major recommendations for improvements. It is pleased to note that all the recommendations have been agreed by the HD.
The Office's major recommendations for improvement to the HD include:

• explore the formulation of measures for monitoring the issuance of advisory letters and case reporting to strengthen its supervision of its PSAs;

• explore how to record the details and follow-up of dripping complaints more systematically to facilitate monitoring;

• consider enhancing its operational guidelines for handling air-conditioner dripping cases, enabling estate management staff to work in clarity and effectively;

• beef up the operational guidelines with clear procedures for frontline staff to investigate the source of dripping, including making every effort to enter suspected flats for air-conditioner testing where there is no other way to verify the source of dripping, for example, when the source cannot be determined through external observation, standardising the durations for testing, and specifying follow-up actions when the source remains unidentified;

• draw up operational guidelines and notices in designated format for cases where the source of dripping has not been determined;

• consider requiring its PSAs to include in their monthly reports the number of advisory letters issued and any repeated cases to facilitate problem detection and follow-up;

• expedite and broaden the adoption of innovative technologies to strengthen its ability to detect dripping air-conditioners; and

• consider collaborating with other government departments (such as the FEHD) to explore opportunities of conducting large-scale inspections as well as publicity and education campaigns, with a view to increasing public engagement and boosting awareness of proper air-conditioner maintenance.
