Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-15 17:30,2026-02-15 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/15/P2026021500479.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 15), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere is currently in the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.
	

The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

​
The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-02-15 17:30,2026-02-15 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/15/P2026021500477.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（二月十五日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球正值冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

"Seminar on white paper on ""Hong Kong: Safeguarding China's National Security Under the Framework of One Country, Two Systems"" held today (with photos/video)",2026-02-14 23:56,2026-02-15 00:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/14/P2026021400835.htm,"  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government held a seminar on the white paper titled ""Hong Kong: Safeguarding China's National Security Under the Framework of One Country, Two Systems"" at the Central Government Offices this morning (February 14). The Chief Executive and the Chairman of the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR, Mr John Lee; Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, ⁠Deputy Director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and National Security Adviser to the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR, Mr Zhou Ji; and Head of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, Mr Dong Jingwei, delivered speeches at the seminar. The HKSAR Government also invited former Director-General of the First Bureau of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, Vice President of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies and Professor of the School of Law of Tsinghua University, Professor Wang Zhenmin; and former Vice-chairperson of the HKSAR Basic Law Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Dr Maria Tam, to deliver keynote speeches to provide an in-depth explanation of the essence and key viewpoints of the white paper. Attendees included Principal Officials of the HKSAR Government, members of the Executive Council, the Legislative Council and the Judiciary, as well as personnel of various offices of the Central People’s Government (CPG) in Hong Kong.

  Addressing the seminar, Mr Lee said that the white paper offers three important points of insight and understanding. First, the white paper offers guiding significance as an authoritative pronouncement to the HKSAR. It stated outright in its preface that the highest principle of fully, faithfully and resolutely implementing the policy of ""one country, two systems"" is to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests. It outlined five areas, including the unrelenting fight for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong, the Central Government's fundamental responsibility for national security matters concerning Hong Kong, the HKSAR's achievements in fulfilling its constitutional responsibility for safeguarding national security, Hong Kong's transformation from disorder to stability and prosperity, and creating high-standard security for the high-quality development of the ""one country, two systems"" policy. The white paper has helped all to understand more clearly that the HKSAR has the constitutional responsibility of effectively safeguarding national security, and that the HKSAR Government and all sectors of the community should proactively implement the requirement.

  Second, the white paper offers cautionary significance grounded in reality with its announcement at a critical point in time. The publication of the white paper at this important juncture carries the cautionary significance as a stark warning, reminding us that Hong Kong has once suffered from incessant political chaos because its national security defences were originally full of gaping loopholes. It was ultimately under the auspices of the HKSAR's legal system for safeguarding national security that our city achieved its transformation from disorder to stability and prosperity. We must draw on past experiences and lessons, always remain vigilant against national security risks, and safeguard national security in Hong Kong on all fronts.

  Third, the white paper offers action-oriented significance for practical implementation by systematically detailing the six principles required in creating high-standard security for the high-quality development of the ""one country, two systems"" policy:

i. Upholding the unity of the Central Government's fundamental responsibility and the HKSAR's constitutional responsibility. Mr Lee said that we must safeguard national security throughout the entire process of the implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" principle. As the head of the HKSAR and taking a leading role in the HKSAR's governance, he will lead and co-ordinate the executive authorities, the legislature and the judiciary of the HKSAR in actively preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for all acts and activities endangering national security. In safeguarding national security, the mechanism whereby the Central Authorities take a guiding role and the HKSAR assumes the principal responsibility is consistent with the principle of ""one country, two systems"", and constitutes a vivid manifestation of the unity between upholding the overall jurisdiction of the Central Authorities and ensuring a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong.

ii. Keeping the power of governing the HKSAR firmly in the hands of patriots. Mr Lee said we must fully implement the principle of ""patriots administering Hong Kong"", uphold and improve the executive-led system, promote positive interactions between the executive authorities and the legislature, and continuously improve the governance efficiency of the HKSAR.

iii. Respecting and ensuring human rights. The Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) protect human rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents in accordance with the Basic Law and the relevant provisions of the international covenants applicable to Hong Kong. They protect law-abiding members of the public and ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" principle.

iv. Safeguarding security under the rule of law. Mr Lee said we must maintain Hong Kong's common law system and improve the HKSAR's legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security. The law enforcement agencies exercise their powers in strict accordance with legal provisions; the Department of Justice controls criminal prosecutions, free from any interference; and the Judiciary exercises its judicial power independently.

v. Following a holistic approach to development and security. Mr Lee highlighted the importance of advancing high-quality development under the auspices of high-standard security, and of achieving high-standard security through high-quality development. He said that greater attention should be given to security in unconventional areas such as finance, shipping, trade, and the protection of overseas interests.

vi. Safeguarding security with greater openness. Mr Lee said that it is important to advance high-level opening up under the protection of high-standard security. Mr Lee expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Central Authorities for the steadfast support to Hong Kong in establishing Hong Kong’s high-standard security, preventing and defusing major risks and hidden challenges, extensively expanding the city’s international connections, and maintaining its long-term prosperity and stability.

  ""National security is of utmost importance to every country. The stability and prosperity we enjoy today did not come easily, so we must treasure it all the more. I will continue to lead the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in safeguarding national security and promoting economic development under the guidance of the holistic approach to national security. We will uphold the six principles stipulated in the white paper in safeguarding national security under 'one country, two systems'. We will do our utmost to safeguard the country's sovereignty, security and development interests, and create high-standard security for the high-quality development of the 'one country, two systems' policy,"" Mr Lee said.

  Mr Zhou said that the white paper is of great and profound significance in clearing up confusion and misunderstandings for building consensus, and consolidating Hong Kong's sound transition from disorder to stability and prosperity. He shared his insights in three areas: First, have a profound grasp of the historical logic behind Hong Kong's safeguarding of national security, and always adhere to the highest principle of ""one country, two systems”. He firmly believes that the HKSAR will adhere to the holistic approach to national security as its guiding principle, fully implement the principle of ""patriots administering Hong Kong"", and unswervingly build a high level of security so as to ensure the steady and sustained implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" policy. Second, have a profound grasp of the institutional logic behind Hong Kong's safeguarding of national security, and always effectively safeguard national security under the rule of law. He believes that the HKSAR will uphold and strengthen the executive-led system, continuously enhance the efficiency of ruling by law as well as the capability and standard in safeguarding national security. Third, have a profound grasp of the practical logic behind Hong Kong's safeguarding of national security, and continuously implement the high-standard security for the high-quality development of ""one country, two systems"". He strongly believes that the HKSAR will better co-ordinate development and security, openness and security, as well as traditional and non-traditional security. The HKSAR will proactively align with the 15th Five-Year Plan with a view to continuously cultivating new drivers and advantages for Hong Kong's development, and thereby safeguarding the new development pattern with a new security framework.

  Mr Dong said it is of great significance that the CPG issued the white paper at the critical juncture of the inaugural year of the 15th Five-Year Plan, a pivotal year for Hong Kong to take new strides in its transition from stability to prosperity. It also coincides with a pivotal moment in history when the landmark national security case in Hong Kong - the conviction and sentencing of Lai Chee-ying - was concluded according to law. It shows the great achievement where the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with President Xi Jinping at its core has fully, faithfully, and resolutely upheld the policy of ""one country, two systems"", showcasing the new bright future of the city entering a new stage of progressing from disorder to stability and prosperity. With an unrelenting fight for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong, the Central People's Government has always prioritised the safeguarding of national security in matters pertaining to Hong Kong. With security as its safeguard, the ""one country, two systems"" principle is being upheld and improved for its steady and sustained implementation. The Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in HKSAR will, as always, steadfastly perform its duties according to law, practise the rule of law for national security, earnestly fulfil its functional role, and fully support the HKSAR in comprehensively and accurately implementing Hong Kong's national security laws. It will resolutely prevent and combat interference and sabotage by external forces, and work hand in hand with all sectors of Hong Kong, moving forward together to jointly safeguard national security, protect Hong Kong's stability, protect the well-being of its citizens, and strive to write a new chapter in the successful implementation of ""one country, two systems"".

  In his keynote speech, Professor Wang explained why the CPG issued the white paper, its main content and underlying principles, and how to effectively utilise the white paper to safeguard the high-quality development of the ""one country, two systems"" policy under high standard of security. He emphasised that the purpose of issuing the white paper is to review Hong Kong's endeavours in safeguarding national security as well as the experience and insights gained in the process, and also to clear up confusion and misunderstandings surrounding the issue to build consensus, and to ensure the high-quality development of the principle of ""one country, two systems"" with high-standard security. The white paper is, in essence, a comprehensive summary and systematic review of the history of the country's efforts to safeguard national security in Hong Kong, focusing on a phased summary of major events, significant actions, and key achievements in safeguarding national security in Hong Kong since 2020, and declaring the CPG's principled stance on this critical issue.

  Citing the white paper, Professor Wang said national security is often taken for granted like air and sunshine, yet cannot be lived without. Safeguarding national security is a responsibility shared by all members of society; everyone is a stakeholder and beneficiary, and no one can be a mere spectator. He explained in depth the fifth part of the white paper: ""Creating High-Standard Security for High-Quality Development of the One Country, Two Systems Policy"" and the practical rules and specific requirements for maintaining national security in six aspects, namely the six ""principles of persistence"". He particularly highlighted that Hong Kong should maintain security while remaining open. He stated that as a key hub connecting the world's second-largest economy with the global economic system, safeguarding national security in Hong Kong means protecting the security of global industrial, supply, and capital chains, safeguarding international economic and financial security, and upholding the basic order of economic globalisation. In a highly internationalised environment, Hong Kong must unwaveringly safeguard national security while steadfastly remaining open, ensuring security through openness and promoting openness with security. He believes that the white paper conveys many important messages, including that ""investors can rest assured that Hong Kong will not descend into chaos again. It ensures both security and development, maintains vitality and freedom, preserves its capitalist system and way of life unchanged over the long term, strictly protects private property, and continues to possess the world's fairest, most open, and most vibrant business environment.""

  He suggested combining the study of the white paper with the study of the Constitution, the Basic Law, and the national security law, to deeply grasp the essence and principles of the white paper. He stressed the importance of persisting in safeguarding national security according to the law to ensure the steady and sustained implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" policy, thereby contributing to and enhancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

  In her keynote address, Dr Tam said that the white paper is rich in content and packed with information. She offered her interpretation of four areas that particularly resonated with her: (1) Hong Kong's responsibility to safeguard national security under the constitutional framework; (2) the necessity of the HKNSL and the SNSO, as well as their innovative compatibility with the ""one country, two systems"" policy; (3) the legalisation and institutionalisation of the principle of ""patriots administering Hong Kong""; and (4) providing high-standard national security safeguards for high-quality productive forces.

  She pointed out that the Central Authorities and the HKSAR worked together to quell the turmoil of the black-clad violence in 2019, the Hong Kong version of a ""colour revolution"". The enactment of the HKNSL and the SNSO, she said, marked a historic milestone in building a robust legal bulwark for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong and in establishing a national security framework under the ""one country, two systems"" principle. She also highlighted the achievements of enshrining the principle of ""patriots administering Hong Kong"" into law and improving the city’s electoral system. She agreed to the white paper that the HKNSL established for the first time the national security mechanism at both the central and HKSAR levels, clearly defining the authority and decision-making powers of the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR. She stressed that Hong Kong is an inseparable part of China and shares a common destiny with the Mainland. The HKSAR, she emphasised, must be guided by a holistic approach to national security to ensure that Hong Kong does not become a city that endangers national security.

  The HKSAR Government will continue, through various channels, to encourage all sectors of society - including political parties, associations, and organisations - to organise study and exchange activities to conscientiously learn and grasp the core principles and directives of the white paper, deepen public awareness and the correct understanding of safeguarding national security in Hong Kong, consciously uphold national security, and make greater contributions to building China into a strong modern country and advancing the great cause of national rejuvenation."

李家超在研討會上分享了三點《白皮書》帶來的重要啓發和領會。第一，《白皮書》對香港特區至為重要，具有一錘定音的指導意義。《白皮書》在前言部分開宗明義指出「維護國家主權、安全、發展利益是『一國兩制』方針的最高原則」，並從五個部分闡明香港維護國家安全的鬥爭從未停止、中央政府對香港有關的國家安全事務負有根本責任、香港特區切實履行維護國家安全的憲制責任、香港實現由亂到治走向由治及興、以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展。《白皮書》讓大家深刻明白香港特區要切實履行維護國家安全的憲制責任，特區政府和香港各界要積極履行其實踐要求。第二，《白皮書》出台的時間節點十分關鍵，具有立足現實的警示意義。《白皮書》在這個重要時候發布具警示意義，警醒我們必須牢記香港曾因國家安全中門大開導致政治亂象不斷，最終是在維護香港國家安全法律制度護佑下實現由亂到治走向由治及興，我們必須深刻總結經驗和教訓，對國家安全風險時刻警惕，全方位做好香港維護國家安全的工作。第三，《白皮書》用「六個堅持」系統論述了以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展，具有實踐落實的行動意義：

一、堅持中央的根本責任和特區的憲制責任相統一。李家超指出，必須把維護國家安全貫穿「一國兩制」實踐的全過程。他作為香港特區首長、當家人，會領導和統籌特區行政、立法、司法機關依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動。在維護國家安全問題上，中央主導、特區主責，符合「一國兩制」方針，是堅持中央全面管治權和保障特區高度自治權相統一的生動體現。

二、堅持把特區管治權牢牢掌握在愛國者手中。李家超表示，要全面落實「愛國者治港」原則，堅持和完善行政主導，並推動行政與立法良性互動，不斷提升特區政府的治理效能。

三、堅持尊重和保障人權。《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》依法保障香港居民根據《基本法》和國際公約適用於香港的規定享有的權利和自由，保護奉公守法的廣大群眾，確保「一國兩制」行穩致遠。

四、堅持在法治軌道上維護安全。李家超指出，要保持香港普通法制度，持續健全特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制。執法機關嚴格依照法律規定行使執法權；律政司主管刑事檢控工作，不受任何干涉；司法機構獨立行使審判權。

五、堅持統籌發展與安全。李家超表示，要以高水平安全護航高質量發展，再以高質量發展保障高水平安全，在新形勢下更重視金融、航運、貿易以及海外利益保護等非傳統領域的安全。

六、堅持在開放中維護安全。李家超表示，要在高水平安全保障下推進高水平開放。他衷心感謝中央始終全力支持香港建設高水平安全，全力支持香港防範化解重大風險隱患，全力支援香港廣泛拓展國際聯繫，全力保持香港長期繁榮穩定。

李家超表示「國之大者，安全為要。我們今天安定繁榮的良好局面來之不易，必須倍加珍惜。我會繼續領導特區維護國家安全和推動發展經濟，以『總體國家安全觀』為指引，把握《白皮書》指出『一國兩制』下維護國家安全『六個堅持』， 全力維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，以高水平安全護航『一國兩制』事業高質量發展。」

周霽致辭時表示，《白皮書》對於正本清源、凝聚共識、鞏固香港由亂到治走向由治及興良好局面，具有重大而深遠的意義。他分享了三點體會：第一，深刻把握香港維護國家安全的歷史邏輯，始終堅守「一國兩制」的最高原則。深信特區一定能以總體國家安全觀為指導，全面落實「愛國者治港」原則，築牢香港維護國家安全防線，保障「一國兩制」實踐行穩致遠。第二，深刻把握香港維護國家安全的制度邏輯，始終在法治軌道上切實維護國家安全。深信特區一定能堅持和完善行政主導，持續提升依法治理效能，不斷提升維護國家安全的能力和水平。第三，深刻把握香港維護國家安全的實踐邏輯，持續推進以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展。堅信特區一定能更好統籌發展和安全、開放和安全、傳統安全和非傳統安全，主動對接國家「十五五」規劃，不斷塑造香港發展新動能新優勢，以新安全格局保障新發展格局。

董經緯致辭時指出，中央政府發布《白皮書》意義重大。適逢「十五五」開局之年、香港由治及興邁出新步伐關鍵之年，適逢香港最具標誌性的國安案件——黎智英案依法定罪判刑歷史節點，展示了以習近平同志為核心的黨中央全面準確、堅定不移貫徹「一國兩制」方針的重大成果，展現了香港從由亂到治走向由治及興新階段的光明前景。香港維護國家安全的鬥爭從未停止，中央政府在香港問題上始終將維護國家安全擺在重要位置。有了安全的護航，「一國兩制」得以堅持和完善，必將繼續行穩致遠。駐港國家安全公署將一如既往堅定依法履職，踐行國安法治，切實發揮職能作用，全力支持香港特區全面準確實施香港國安法律，堅決防範打擊外部勢力干擾破壞，與特區各界同心攜手、並肩而行，共同守護國家安全、守護香港穩定、守護市民福祉，奮力續寫「一國兩制」成功實踐新的篇章！

王振民於主旨發言中闡釋中央政府為甚麼發布《白皮書》、《白皮書》的主要內容和原則精神，以及如何用好《白皮書》，以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展。他強調發表《白皮書》的目的是為全面總結香港維護國家安全的實踐歷程和經驗啓示，正本清源、凝聚共識，以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展。《白皮書》實際上是我國關於香港維護國家安全鬥爭歷史的全面總結和系統疏理，重點是階段性總結二○二○年以來在香港維護國家安全的重大事件、重大行動、重要成果，宣示中央政府對這一重大問題的原則立場。

王振民引述《白皮書》內容，形容國家安全猶如空氣、陽光，受益而不覺，失之則難存。維護國家安全沒有「局外人」，人人都是國家安全的持份者、受益人，也是國家安全的守護者、責任人。他重點闡述《白皮書》第五部分「以高水平安全護航『一國兩制』事業高質量發展」，以及維護國家安全六個方面的實踐規律和具體要求，即六個「堅持」，更強調香港應在開放中維護安全。他表示，作為連接世界第二大經濟體和全球經濟體系的關鍵樞紐，在香港維護國家安全，就是維護全球產業鏈、供應鏈、資金鏈安全，就是維護國際經濟金融安全，就是維護經濟全球化的基本秩序。在高度國際化環境下，香港既堅定不移維護國家安全，又堅定不移保持開放，在開放中保安全，以安全促開放。他認為《白皮書》釋放了許多重要信息，包括「投資者可以放心，香港不會再亂，而且既保安全，又保發展，有活力，有自由，長期保持資本主義制度和生活方式不變，嚴格保護私有財產，繼續擁有全球最公平、最開放、最具活力的營商環境。」

他建議，要把學習《白皮書》與學習《憲法》、《基本法》和國安法結合起來，深入領會《白皮書》的精髓要義、原則精神，堅持依法維護國家安全，確保「一國兩制」實踐行穩致遠，為民族偉大復興增光添彩。

《「一國兩制」下香港維護國家安全的實踐》白皮書專題研討會今日舉行（附圖）,2026-02-14 18:42,2026-02-14 23:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/14/P2026021400656.htm,"香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）今日（二月十四日）上午在政府總部舉辦《「一國兩制」下香港維護國家安全的實踐》白皮書（《白皮書》）專題研討會（研討會）。行政長官、香港特區維護國家安全委員會主席李家超，中央港澳工作辦公室（中央港澳辦）副主任、國務院港澳事務辦公室副主任、中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室主任、香港特區維護國家安全委員會國家安全事務顧問周霽，中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全公署（駐港國家安全公署）署長董經緯分別在研討會上致辭。特區政府邀請中央港澳辦一局原局長、全國港澳研究會副會長、清華大學法學院教授王振民和全國人民代表大會常務委員會香港特別行政區基本法委員會原副主任譚惠珠博士於研討會發表主旨發言，深入闡釋《白皮書》的精髓要義和重要觀點。研討會出席人士包括特區政府主要官員、行政會議成員、立法會議員、司法機構人員，以及中央駐港機構人員。

李家超在研討會上分享了三點《白皮書》帶來的重要啓發和領會。第一，《白皮書》對香港特區至為重要，具有一錘定音的指導意義。《白皮書》在前言部分開宗明義指出「維護國家主權、安全、發展利益是『一國兩制』方針的最高原則」，並從五個部分闡明香港維護國家安全的鬥爭從未停止、中央政府對香港有關的國家安全事務負有根本責任、香港特區切實履行維護國家安全的憲制責任、香港實現由亂到治走向由治及興、以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展。《白皮書》讓大家深刻明白香港特區要切實履行維護國家安全的憲制責任，特區政府和香港各界要積極履行其實踐要求。第二，《白皮書》出台的時間節點十分關鍵，具有立足現實的警示意義。《白皮書》在這個重要時候發布具警示意義，警醒我們必須牢記香港曾因國家安全中門大開導致政治亂象不斷，最終是在維護香港國家安全法律制度護佑下實現由亂到治走向由治及興，我們必須深刻總結經驗和教訓，對國家安全風險時刻警惕，全方位做好香港維護國家安全的工作。第三，《白皮書》用「六個堅持」系統論述了以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展，具有實踐落實的行動意義：

一、堅持中央的根本責任和特區的憲制責任相統一。李家超指出，必須把維護國家安全貫穿「一國兩制」實踐的全過程。他作為香港特區首長、當家人，會領導和統籌特區行政、立法、司法機關依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動。在維護國家安全問題上，中央主導、特區主責，符合「一國兩制」方針，是堅持中央全面管治權和保障特區高度自治權相統一的生動體現。

二、堅持把特區管治權牢牢掌握在愛國者手中。李家超表示，要全面落實「愛國者治港」原則，堅持和完善行政主導，並推動行政與立法良性互動，不斷提升特區政府的治理效能。

三、堅持尊重和保障人權。《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》依法保障香港居民根據《基本法》和國際公約適用於香港的規定享有的權利和自由，保護奉公守法的廣大群眾，確保「一國兩制」行穩致遠。

四、堅持在法治軌道上維護安全。李家超指出，要保持香港普通法制度，持續健全特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制。執法機關嚴格依照法律規定行使執法權；律政司主管刑事檢控工作，不受任何干涉；司法機構獨立行使審判權。

五、堅持統籌發展與安全。李家超表示，要以高水平安全護航高質量發展，再以高質量發展保障高水平安全，在新形勢下更重視金融、航運、貿易以及海外利益保護等非傳統領域的安全。

六、堅持在開放中維護安全。李家超表示，要在高水平安全保障下推進高水平開放。他衷心感謝中央始終全力支持香港建設高水平安全，全力支持香港防範化解重大風險隱患，全力支援香港廣泛拓展國際聯繫，全力保持香港長期繁榮穩定。

李家超表示「國之大者，安全為要。我們今天安定繁榮的良好局面來之不易，必須倍加珍惜。我會繼續領導特區維護國家安全和推動發展經濟，以『總體國家安全觀』為指引，把握《白皮書》指出『一國兩制』下維護國家安全『六個堅持』， 全力維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，以高水平安全護航『一國兩制』事業高質量發展。」

周霽致辭時表示，《白皮書》對於正本清源、凝聚共識、鞏固香港由亂到治走向由治及興良好局面，具有重大而深遠的意義。他分享了三點體會：第一，深刻把握香港維護國家安全的歷史邏輯，始終堅守「一國兩制」的最高原則。深信特區一定能以總體國家安全觀為指導，全面落實「愛國者治港」原則，築牢香港維護國家安全防線，保障「一國兩制」實踐行穩致遠。第二，深刻把握香港維護國家安全的制度邏輯，始終在法治軌道上切實維護國家安全。深信特區一定能堅持和完善行政主導，持續提升依法治理效能，不斷提升維護國家安全的能力和水平。第三，深刻把握香港維護國家安全的實踐邏輯，持續推進以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展。堅信特區一定能更好統籌發展和安全、開放和安全、傳統安全和非傳統安全，主動對接國家「十五五」規劃，不斷塑造香港發展新動能新優勢，以新安全格局保障新發展格局。

董經緯致辭時指出，中央政府發布《白皮書》意義重大。適逢「十五五」開局之年、香港由治及興邁出新步伐關鍵之年，適逢香港最具標誌性的國安案件——黎智英案依法定罪判刑歷史節點，展示了以習近平同志為核心的黨中央全面準確、堅定不移貫徹「一國兩制」方針的重大成果，展現了香港從由亂到治走向由治及興新階段的光明前景。香港維護國家安全的鬥爭從未停止，中央政府在香港問題上始終將維護國家安全擺在重要位置。有了安全的護航，「一國兩制」得以堅持和完善，必將繼續行穩致遠。駐港國家安全公署將一如既往堅定依法履職，踐行國安法治，切實發揮職能作用，全力支持香港特區全面準確實施香港國安法律，堅決防範打擊外部勢力干擾破壞，與特區各界同心攜手、並肩而行，共同守護國家安全、守護香港穩定、守護市民福祉，奮力續寫「一國兩制」成功實踐新的篇章！

王振民於主旨發言中闡釋中央政府為甚麼發布《白皮書》、《白皮書》的主要內容和原則精神，以及如何用好《白皮書》，以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展。他強調發表《白皮書》的目的是為全面總結香港維護國家安全的實踐歷程和經驗啓示，正本清源、凝聚共識，以高水平安全護航「一國兩制」事業高質量發展。《白皮書》實際上是我國關於香港維護國家安全鬥爭歷史的全面總結和系統疏理，重點是階段性總結二○二○年以來在香港維護國家安全的重大事件、重大行動、重要成果，宣示中央政府對這一重大問題的原則立場。

王振民引述《白皮書》內容，形容國家安全猶如空氣、陽光，受益而不覺，失之則難存。維護國家安全沒有「局外人」，人人都是國家安全的持份者、受益人，也是國家安全的守護者、責任人。他重點闡述《白皮書》第五部分「以高水平安全護航『一國兩制』事業高質量發展」，以及維護國家安全六個方面的實踐規律和具體要求，即六個「堅持」，更強調香港應在開放中維護安全。他表示，作為連接世界第二大經濟體和全球經濟體系的關鍵樞紐，在香港維護國家安全，就是維護全球產業鏈、供應鏈、資金鏈安全，就是維護國際經濟金融安全，就是維護經濟全球化的基本秩序。在高度國際化環境下，香港既堅定不移維護國家安全，又堅定不移保持開放，在開放中保安全，以安全促開放。他認為《白皮書》釋放了許多重要信息，包括「投資者可以放心，香港不會再亂，而且既保安全，又保發展，有活力，有自由，長期保持資本主義制度和生活方式不變，嚴格保護私有財產，繼續擁有全球最公平、最開放、最具活力的營商環境。」

他建議，要把學習《白皮書》與學習《憲法》、《基本法》和國安法結合起來，深入領會《白皮書》的精髓要義、原則精神，堅持依法維護國家安全，確保「一國兩制」實踐行穩致遠，為民族偉大復興增光添彩。
