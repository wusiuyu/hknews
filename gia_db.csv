Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-09-11 15:20,2025-09-11 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100555.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on September 10 to noon today (September 11), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 121 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

懲教署更生服務研究組於二○二四年二月起和香港中文大學（中大）心理學系就終止犯罪展開合作研究，與51名更生人士及60名在囚人士進行訪談及焦點小組討論，涵蓋成人、青少年、男性及女性不同群組，並進行深入分析，整合出本地更生人士改過自新的歷程及關鍵因素。

中大心理學系研究教授梁永亮教授在研討會上公布研究結果時指出，透過更生服務以正面的方法滿足更生人士對關愛及個人能力的內心需要，有助他們改過自新及遠離犯罪。研究歸納出三個關鍵因素，包括提供多元化的學習機會、擴展正向社交支援網絡，以及培養及持續強化個人能力、自我身分認同與正向人際關係。研究亦顯示，懲教署的更生計劃不單有助降低更生人士的重犯機會，重塑奉公守法的新身分，重新連結社會，亦支援他們回饋社會，逐步轉化人生。

懲教署高級臨床心理學家李潔珊博士表示，研究結果確立署方在更生工作方面的成效，亦為未來發展帶來啓示。懲教署會參考研究結果，推展強項為本的更生策略及強化懲教職員更生領航員的角色，同時積極將更生服務由懲教院所延伸至社區，並支持更生人士回饋社會。

研討會上，懲教署的臨床心理學家介紹以終止犯罪理論為核心的新社區更生項目——「逆轉人生‧真人圖書館」，首創以結合敘事治療及四格漫畫的方式展示更生人士的生命故事，從而協助他們反思過去，遠離犯罪，並重拾正向生活，改寫未來人生。此外，署方安排更生人士親身分享他參與心理治療計劃的經驗及改過自新的心路歷程，而李潔珊博士及梁永亮教授亦就研究結果、更生服務及未來發展與參加者交流。

秉承與時並進及實證為本的精神，懲教署會繼續舉辦學術活動，積極促進與更生服務業界人士及學者交流合作，以科研促進更生工作的專業發展與創新。"
CSD holds seminar on correctional psychology research and practice (with photos),2025-09-11 15:13,2025-09-11 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100298.htm,"The Correctional Services Department (CSD) today (September 11) held the Desistance from Crime: Correctional Research and Practice Professional Seminar to disseminate the latest research findings in correctional psychology and to explore strategic directions for future rehabilitation and crime prevention work, with the participation of over 100 members of the rehabilitation services sector and scholars.

Since February 2024, the Correctional Rehabilitation Research Unit of the CSD, in collaboration with the Department of Psychology of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), has commenced a research initiative on desistance from crime. The research involved interviews and focus group discussions with 51 rehabilitated persons and 60 persons in custody, covering different groups including adults, adolescents, males and females. Through in-depth analysis, the research summarised desistance journeys of local rehabilitated persons and key factors to desist from crime.

The Research Professor of the Department of Psychology of the CUHK, Professor Patrick Leung, presented the research findings at the seminar. He said that, through rehabilitation services, addressing rehabilitated persons' inner needs for care and personal competence with a positive approach was found conducive to their rehabilitation and supportive of their desistance from crime. The research identified three key factors in rehabilitation, namely offering diverse learning opportunities, expanding positive social support networks, and nurturing and sustaining personal competence, self-identity and constructive interpersonal relationships. The research also indicated that the CSD's rehabilitation programmes not only help reduce recidivism among rehabilitated persons, rebuild their law-abiding identity and reconnect them with society, but also support them in giving back to society, thereby gradually transforming their lives.

Senior Clinical Psychologist of the CSD Dr Yvonne Lee stated that the research findings affirmed the effectiveness of the rehabilitation work of the CSD and brought insights for future development. Drawing on the findings, the CSD will advance strength-based rehabilitation strategies and reinforce the role of correctional officers as rehabilitation facilitators, while actively extending its rehabilitation services from correctional institutions to the community and supporting rehabilitated persons in giving back to society.

At the seminar, a clinical psychologist of the CSD introduced an innovative community-based rehabilitation initiative based on the theory of desistance from crime - ""Human Library: Desistance from Crime"". This pioneering initiative combines narrative therapy with a four-panel comic to showcase the life stories of rehabilitated persons, encouraging reflections on their past, disengagement from criminal behaviours and the cultivation of a positive lifestyle, thereby rewriting their futures. Furthermore, the Department arranged for a rehabilitated person to share his experiences in participating in psychological treatment programmes and his desistance journey. Dr Lee and Professor Leung also exchanged views with participants on the research findings, rehabilitation services and the directions for future development.

Upholding the spirit of moving with the times and evidence-based practice, the CSD will continue to organise academic events to actively promote collaboration and exchanges with members of the rehabilitation services sector and scholars to advance professional development and innovation of rehabilitation work through scientific research."

Reporter: So, what is the expected timeline for the roll out of legalising basketball betting, and what regulatory measures will be implemented to ensure responsible betting and protect vulnerable populations?

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: First of all, I would like to thank the Legislative Council for passing the Bill. After the passage of the Bill, we will move on to liaise with the Hong Kong Jockey Club about the terms of the licence and, after the negotiations and liaison, we will issue the licence to the operator, that is, the Hong Kong Jockey Club. I think they need some time to gear up, like implementing some IT measures and some facilities. We will announce the substantial timeline in the near future.

As for public education on how to educate and publicise the bad influence and effects of illegal betting and irresponsible gambling, we will launch a series of new measures including public education and publicity measures focusing on teenagers. We will also set up another new centre, which will focus on the education and publicity work for young people in the near future. Altogether, under the Ping Wo Fund, there will be five education centres and support centres to help those with problems like illegal gambling or obsessive gambling.

​立法會：民政及青年事務局局長就恢復二讀辯論《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》發言（只有中文）,2025-09-11 15:03,2025-09-11 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100484.htm,"以下是民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟今日（九月十一日）在立法會會議上就恢復二讀辯論《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）的發言：

主席：

我謹動議恢復二讀《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》。

首先，我特別感謝法案委員會主席陳振英議員和各位參與法案委員會的議員，以及立法會秘書處同事付出的努力，令審議《條例草案》的工作得以順利完成，並可以在今日恢復二讀辯論。我亦感謝剛才發言支持《條例草案》二讀的各位議員，以及各位提出的寶貴意見。

正如我在動議二讀《條例草案》時提到，政府一貫的政策是不鼓勵賭博。針對賭博問題，政府採取多管齊下的策略，包括透過執法打擊非法賭博活動、透過公眾教育宣傳沉迷賭博的禍害、為有需要人士提供輔導和支援服務。而最後一項措施是透過法例規管賭博活動。政府提供合法賭博途徑的目的，只在於回應市民對某些賭博活動的需求，以免他們轉向非法的經營者下注。

《條例草案》的目的，是透過修訂《博彩稅條例》（第108章）及附屬法例，訂立籃球博彩活動的規管框架，賦權民政及青年事務局局長發出營運籃球博彩的牌照，並制定相關牌照條件，以減少賭博對市民，尤其是青少年的不良影響。

今年四至五月，我們就籃球博彩規管制度進行了為期一個月的諮詢，收到的意見絕大部分支持設立相關制度。我們亦向立法會民政及文化體育事務委員會簡介諮詢結果和相關規管制度，並得到委員會支持。

其後，法案委員會詳細審視了《條例草案》的條文。我們感謝法案委員會對《條例草案》提出不少寶貴的意見，而政府在法案委員會上亦已就委員提出的事項，包括打擊非法賭博和預防賭博等方面的工作作出詳細解釋。

我感謝剛才發言的28位議員，也感謝議員支持《條例草案》和就《條例草案》提出了寶貴的意見。接下來，我會綜合回應議員的意見和觀察，以及簡單總結及回應法案委員會在審議《條例草案》時較關注的事項。

第一，是有關籃球博彩規範化的政策考慮。有見參與非法籃球賭博人數不少，顯示社會上有切實而持續的需求，因此近年有不少社會人士關注非法籃球賭博的影響。在此情況下，為有效打擊非法賭博活動，政府決定訂立籃球博彩活動的規管框架，以免資金流向非法渠道，以及加強保障投注人士。若《條例草案》獲通過，政府計劃參考足球博彩模式以香港賽馬會（馬會）為唯一營運商。

第二，有議員關注打擊網上非法賭博活動的問題。香港警務處一直有既定策略打擊非法賭博活動，例如進行網上巡邏及透過不同渠道搜集情報、作出調查，並且在取得足夠證據後採取執法行動。近兩年半，警方曾向網站營運商發出至少300個移除涉及非法賭博活動網站的要求。二○二四年，警方總共拘捕了5 341人，涉及各類型的非法賭博罪行。

同時，我們也會加強宣傳參與非法賭博的刑罰。簡單來說，不僅開賭會受刑罰，下注也會受刑罰。根據《賭博條例》（第148章），非法收受賭注，即開賭，最高可以被判處罰款港幣500萬元和監禁七年。而參與非法賭博，即投注者，他們都是違法，一經定罪，最高可被判處罰款港幣五萬元和監禁九個月。在設立規管框架後，我們會繼續密切監察非法賭博趨勢，採取宣傳教育及執法雙管齊下的措施，以進一步打擊各類型非法賭博活動。

第三，在預防沉迷賭博問題方面，我們會持續進行兩方面的重點工作，包括施加嚴謹的法律與規管約束，以減少賭博對市民的不良影響；以及通過加強平和基金在提供輔導、治療服務、教育和宣傳活動的工作，以提升公眾對沉迷賭博禍害的認識。其中，雖然青少年參與賭博的比例在過去幾年一直維持在低水平，我們仍會增撥資源，在現時資助的四間輔導中心以外，設立專注於為青少年提供輔導及支援服務的新中心，向青少年樹立正確的法律觀和價值觀，特別是通過宣傳教育提醒青少年，參與非法賭博、向非法收受賭注者投注已屬違法。

我們知道很多議員對平和基金的工作有很多意見和建議，正如我在事務委員會和法案委員會會議時，已經多次重申，我們會檢討現在平和基金的各項工作，尤其是現在四間輔導中心的工作成效。

主席，有議員提出對規範籃球博彩的憂慮和擔心，不過正如我在法案委員會和事務委員會所說，剛才亦有議員引述，政府在打擊非法賭博的工作並不止於今次修訂條例規範籃球博彩，我們會不斷和加大力度採取執法行動打擊非法賭博。我們也有新措施，向社會宣傳沉迷賭博的禍害，尤其是針對青年人的宣傳教育工作。我們不是單單規範籃球博彩來打擊非法賭博，而是會持續、不斷以不同手法加強打擊非法賭博。規範籃球博彩只是其中一項措施打擊非法賭博，正如議員所說，我們不止於此，還會有其他的措施持續進行。

亦有多名議員提出，若香港賽馬會獲發籃球博彩牌照之後，是否應該增加撥款支持體育發展？馬會現時將大約90%的稅後經營盈餘撥捐予馬會慈善信託基金，推動多個重點策略範疇，包括青年發展及扶貧和體育及文化等。信託基金已審批的慈善捐款金額由二○○三／○四年度的9.75億港元增至二○二三／二四年度的102億港元。政府亦已要求馬會繼續投放更多資源和撥出額外的資金，持續推動包括體育發展和青年培訓在內的各種慈善及公益工作。

剛才也有議員提到，馬會在今年六月公布撥款4.5億港元，作為香港賽區唯一合作夥伴，支持籌辦第十五屆全國運動會及全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會。馬會最近亦公布撥款逾7千萬港元，資助非牟利機構舉辦一系列籃球訓練及活動，以推動本地籃球體育發展。我們會繼續要求馬會對香港的慈善和體育發展作出更大貢獻。

主席，《條例草案》為籃球博彩活動訂立規管框架，透過將博彩需求導入受規管的合法渠道，以打擊非法籃球賭博活動。在《條例草案》通過後，我們會繼續與馬會、警務處、平和基金諮詢委員會、博彩及獎券事務委員會及其他持份者一起緊密合作，確保有效落實規管制度。我們亦將繼續採取多管齊下的策略，以積極有為的態度做好及優化預防及緩減與賭博有關問題的工作。

我懇請議員支持及通過《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》。

我謹此陳辭。多謝主席。"
SFST's special remarks at 10th Belt and Road Summit - Business Networking Luncheon (English only),2025-09-11 15:00,2025-09-11 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100347.htm,"  Following are the special remarks by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the 10th Belt and Road Summit – Business Networking Luncheon on ""Connecting Growth Corridors – ASEAN and the Belt and Road"" today (September 11):

Luanne (Chief Executive Officer, Hong Kong, of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC), Ms Luanne Lim), Algernon (Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau), Professor Frederick Ma (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 It is my great pleasure to join you at this exclusive luncheon hosted by HSBC during the Belt and Road Summit. My heartfelt congratulations to HSBC for convening this distinguished gathering of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and local business leaders under the theme ""Connecting Growth Corridors – ASEAN and the Belt and Road"". This occasion exemplifies Hong Kong's pivotal role as a super connector, fostering open dialogue and forging partnerships to drive the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) forward.

 Since its inception in 2013, the BRI has been guided by the core principles of connectivity, openness, mutual respect, and shared prosperity. Over the past decade, its scope has expanded remarkably, fostering co-operation across continents through physical infrastructure, trade networks, and increasingly, technological collaboration. This dynamic evolution positions the BRI as a powerful platform for sustainable growth, with Hong Kong as a key contributor, facilitating seamless connections between Mainland China, ASEAN, and global markets. Our strategic location, robust financial systems and world-class professional services make Hong Kong the ideal hub for BRI-related investments and partnerships. In fact, we have signed Comprehensive Double Taxation Agreements with 37 Belt and Road jurisdictions, facilitating business expansion and investment.

 Hong Kong's financial markets are thriving, reflecting the confidence and resilience that underpin our role in the BRI. In the first eight months of this year, our stock market achieved an average daily turnover of US$31.9 billion, a 132 per cent increase over the same period of last year. Funds raised through initial public offerings (IPOs) soared to US$17.3 billion, up 579 per cent. These figures highlight Hong Kong's status as a premier global IPO hub, offering BRI enterprises unparalleled access to capital, underpinned by our rule of law, simple tax regime, and deep market connectivity. Earlier in August, a mining company rooted in Kazakhstan successfully listed on in our market, showcasing the results of co-operation between Hong Kong and Central Asia in advancing the BRI initiative. This also marks the Central Asia's first case of an IPO financed in RMB (Renminbi).

 Besides the stellar performance of our stock market, we have also proudly launched a company redomiciliation regime this year, and some leading international insurance companies have already taken advantage of that. This initiative provides a secure and efficient pathway for overseas companies to redomicile to Hong Kong, enabling them to leverage our financial ecosystem to support more expansion initiatives including BRI projects. With the Companies Registry's efficient approval process and our collaboration with offshore jurisdictions to streamline deregistration, we invite businesses to make Hong Kong their strategic base for navigating global uncertainties and driving BRI growth.

 And on the risk management front, Hong Kong is solidifying its position as Asia's leading insurance hub, critical for BRI enterprises managing complex cross-border projects. With some 160 authorised insurers and last year's gross premiums of HK$637.8 billion, Hong Kong ranks first in Asia for insurance density and globally for penetration at 18.2 per cent. Captive insurance, offering tailored risk solutions, is gaining momentum, with new entrants like HSBC bringing our total to six captive insurers. Our incentives, including a 50 per cent profits tax reduction, simplified capital requirements and a robust pool of insurance professionals, make Hong Kong the ideal base for managing BRI-related risks, from infrastructure to cybersecurity.

 Looking ahead, Hong Kong is committed to deepening BRI co-operation. Through initiatives like mutual market access with the Greater Bay Area, proactive outreach to global enterprises, and promotion of our insurance and financial strengths, we are empowering ASEAN and BRI partners to seize opportunities, manage risks, and achieve shared prosperity.

 In closing, I commend HSBC for hosting this platform to strengthen ties and drive collaboration. Let us harness Hong Kong's unique advantages to advance the Belt and Road Initiative, connecting growth corridors and building a sustainable future together. Thank you, and I wish you a productive and inspiring luncheon."

Speech by FS at Biotechnology Investment Forum of BIOHK2025 (English only) (with photos),2025-09-11 12:03,2025-09-11 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100350.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Biotechnology Investment Forum of BIOHK2025 today (September 11):

Albert (Chairman of the Hong Kong Biotechnology Organization and President of BIOHK2025, Professor Albert Yu), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is a great pleasure to join you today at the opening of the Biotechnology Investment Forum, here on Day 2 of BIOHK 2025. A warm welcome to all participants joining us from Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and around the world.

This Forum brings together a global community of pioneers, including scientists, entrepreneurs, investors and policymakers, who are leading the way in biotech development. It offers a valuable platform to exchange insights, foster collaboration, and explore opportunities to drive the next wave of growth in this rapidly evolving sector.

We meet at a time of rapid advancement in biotechnology, especially as it converges with artificial intelligence. Yet alongside advances and breakthroughs, the sector is grappling with a number of critical issues. How can we accelerate R&D (research and development) efficiency and clinical translation? How do we strengthen supply chain resilience and overcome technological barriers? How can we ensure access and inclusivity in biomedicine? And how do we equip biomed talent in an AI-driven world?

At the same time, the rise of China as a biotechnology leader is reshaping the global innovation landscape. The Mainland is now the world's second-largest biopharmaceutical market. Its biotech enterprises account for nearly 30 per cent of global innovative drug assets, up from just 10 per cent in 2019. This remarkable shift reflects not only our country's growing capability and capacity, but also its long-term strategic commitment and sustained investment in the sector.

In this context, there is no better place than Hong Kong to host this important discussion. Our city welcomes ideas, talent and capital from around the world. We serve as a gateway to the fast-expanding Mainland market, and as a launch pad for Mainland innovations to go global.

Indeed, under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong enjoys the best of both worlds. We uphold the rule of law and continue to practise the common law system. With the free flow of capital, information and talent, Hong Kong remains deeply connected to the international community. Our intellectual property protections align with the best international standards, and our financial institutions and professional services are world-class. These qualities make Hong Kong a reliable and trusted partner for technology development and investment.

More specifically, allow me to highlight four key areas where Hong Kong can make a difference for global biotech development.

A dynamic I&T ecosystem

First, our innovation and technology (I&T) ecosystem is growing in depth and breadth. It supports the full biotech value chain, from upstream research and product design to downstream commercialisation and market expansion.

At the upstream level, Hong Kong's universities are world leading. Five of them rank among the world’s top 100, with two medical schools among the global top 25. We have also established 14 dedicated healthcare research centres led by eminent academic and clinical researchers. Their work spans genomics, regenerative medicine, organoid models, cell therapy and beyond.

In the midstream, we are stepping up efforts to translate research into real-world applications. Government schemes such as the RAISe+ Programme are helping to bridge the gap between laboratories and market, facilitating the growth of new biotech ventures.

Downstream, we are nurturing targeted industries where Hong Kong holds strategic advantages, in particular biotech and AI. Today, Hong Kong is home to over 4 700 start-ups and nearly 20 unicorns, many of which are nurtured and supported by the Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport. 

We continue to attract strategic enterprises from around the world. Over the past two years, more than 80 such enterprises have established a presence in Hong Kong, investing over US$6.5 billion and creating some 20 000 quality jobs. A new batch of enterprises, including several world-leading pharmaceutical companies, will soon join their ranks.

One of Hong Kong's unique advantages is its role as a convergence point for international and Mainland data. This is particularly valuable for biotech enterprises engaged in clinical trials as well as drug discovery and development.

Artificial intelligence is central to the next wave of biotech innovation. Hong Kong has prioritised AI as a core industry and a key enabler to transform other sectors. We are building our AI capabilities across five pillars: data, algorithms, computing power, capital and talent. In Hong Kong, a number of homegrown start-ups and foreign enterprises are actively engaged in AI-driven drug discovery, diagnostic tools and personalised medicine.

Access to capital

Second, Hong Kong offers biotech firms access to deep and diversified capital pools.

Our stock market is a prime example. In the first seven months of 2025, US$16 billion was raised through IPOs (initial public offerings) in Hong Kong, a six-fold increase compared to the same period last year. The biotech sector was a key beneficiary, with 15 IPOs raising nearly US$3 billion. The Hang Seng Biotech Index has surged more than 85 per cent, outperforming regional and global peers.

This growth builds on our capital market reforms. In 2018, we introduced a listing regime for pre-revenue biotech companies and companies with weighted voting rights structures. These reforms have transformed the Hong Kong stock market.

As of July, more than 75 biotech firms had listed under the reformed regime, raising over US$30 billion. This makes Hong Kong the second-largest biotech fundraising centre globally.

We are also enhancing our listing process. In line with this year's Budget, a dedicated channel for technology enterprises has been launched to provide tailored support to biotech and deep-tech firms preparing for IPOs. This initiative helps companies navigate the process with greater clarity and confidence.

Beyond public markets, we offer a robust private capital ecosystem. Hong Kong is home to over 650 private equity and venture capital firms, with US$230 billion in assets under management, second only to the Chinese Mainland in Asia.

We understand that some of the most cutting-edge biotech segments - such as novel proteins, frontier diagnostics and surgical robotics - require long-term investment. This is where patient capital comes into play. The Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC), which was established in 2022 with US$8 billion initial capital, invests and co-invests in biotech and hardtech companies, among others. To date, it has deployed about 20 per cent of its invested capital in biotech projects.

The HKIC also plays a crucial role in connecting Hong Kong and Mainland innovations with global capital, enabling cross-border partnerships and supporting their effort to go global.

Supportive Government policies

Third, Hong Kong's policy and regulatory environment is supportive of biotech innovation.

In addition to the finance side mentioned earlier, we are working to establish a primary evaluation mechanism for drug approvals. This will allow Hong Kong to independently review and approve medical products and devices, aligning them with international standards and accelerating their time to the market.

To this end, we are establishing the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation. We have joined the International Council for Harmonisation as an observer and are investing in the needed infrastructure, systems and talent to support this transition. Our target is to begin phased implementation of the new framework in 2026, with full rollout by 2030.

This initiative will enhance Hong Kong's role as a base for R&D, clinical trials and regional co-operation. Indeed, for international pharmaceutical firms, approval in Hong Kong may serve as a strategic pathway to get faster access to the Mainland market, especially within the Greater Bay Area (GBA).

Our collaboration across the GBA continues to deepen. With 87 million residents, the GBA is a vast market for health products and a key resource for clinical research. In the Hetao Innovation and Technology Park, also known as the Loop Area, Hong Kong and Shenzhen have established cross-boundary clinical trial institutions that support studies complying with the standards and requirements of both jurisdictions.

We are also working to enable the seamless flow of data, capital, talent and other factors of production with Shenzhen in the Hetao area, creating an innovation corridor for biotech and pharmaceutical companies.

Welcoming global talent

Finally, talent is a cornerstone of our biotech strategy. Since late 2022, Hong Kong has received over 510 000 applications under various talent admission schemes, with more than 340 000 approvals and nearly 230 000 arrivals to date. And under one of the schemes - the Top Talent Pass Scheme, around 20 per cent of the talent are engaged in innovation and technology.

We continue to attract top researchers, scientists and professionals from around the world. There is a growing number of ethnic Chinese scientists looking to Hong Kong as a globally connected and friendly base to work.

Closing

Ladies and gentlemen, the opportunities in biotechnology are enormous. With our institutional strengths, deep financial resources, research excellence, supportive government policies and world-class talent, Hong Kong has what it takes to shine in the next wave of biotech breakthroughs.

Whether you are an innovator seeking capital, an investor looking for promising projects, or an organisation seeking biotech solutions - Hong Kong welcomes you.

Let us work together to turn today's ideas into tomorrow's innovations.

Thank you, and I wish you all a successful and rewarding Forum."

​財政司司長出席中金公司2025粵港澳大灣區財富管理峰會致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-09-11 11:45,2025-09-11 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100337.htm,"以下是財政司司長陳茂波今日（九月十一日）出席中金公司2025粵港澳大灣區財富管理峰會的致辭：

徐衞剛部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室經濟部部長徐衞剛）、陳董事長（中金公司董事長、管理委員會主席陳亮）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！很高興出席2025粵港澳大灣區財富管理峰會。適逢今年是中金公司成立30周年，並在香港交易所上市10周年，讓我們先對中金公司表示最熱烈的祝賀！也為中金舉辦此次峰會，匯聚各方智慧，共商香港和大灣區財富管理的未來發展，衷心點讚！

地緣政治的變化

當前世界百年變局正加速演進，地緣政治正在深刻重塑經濟體之間的關係，國際金融市場也因此出現了新的局面。對香港這個國際金融中心來說，確實面臨一些挑戰，但更多的是看到了機遇。

今年以來，國際政經格局緊隨着美國新政府的上場而變得緊張，單邊主義、保護主義的政策為全球經濟帶來了陰霾和不確定性。國際投資者越來越意識到必須通過多元化配置資産來分散風險，並更好捕捉全球不同地區的增長機遇。

但不管外圍環境怎樣變化，在中央的英明領導下，我國經濟一直平穩增長，投資價值正被國際投資者重新重視。如果說去年下半年國際投資者本來就有加大在這個地區投資的意願，年初DeepSeek的驚艷登場，可以說是點燃了全球對投資中國的熱情。許多投資者意識到此前低配了在中國市場的投資，並馬上積極調整配置。香港作為連接中外資本市場的「超級聯繫人」，在這一波的變化中可以說是受惠者。

一系列的數據說明，香港正在吸引更多全球資金匯聚。以股市為例，去年恒生指數上升18%，今年以來再上升了接近30%，IPO（首次公開招股）募資額已經超過1,300億元，再融資額超過3,400億元，都比去年同期大幅上升。銀行存款也上升接近8%，接近18.7萬億元。

資管業務的機遇

資金流入很自然帶動資產管理業務的增長。證監會（證券及期貨事務監察委員會）最新發布的調查指出，去年香港管理的資產總值按年增加13%至超過35萬億港元，是本地生產總值的11倍，淨資金流入更達7,050億港元，按年上升超過八成。與此同時，不少從事資產管理業務的金融機構都在香港擴充業務、增聘人手、租用更多商業樓面。金管局（香港金融管理局）的數據顯示，多家國際銀行和資産管理公司預計未來數年增聘的人手從10%至100%不等。事實上，根據業界估算，香港將在兩、三年內成為全球規模最大的跨境財富管理中心。

一直以來，在香港管理的資產，來自內地與香港投資者的跟來自海外的約各佔一半。隨着內地經濟持續發展和亞洲的富裕人口不斷增加，香港未來在資產及財富管理領域的發展更大有可為。

粵港澳大灣區將會是增長的重要動力源之一。二○二四年，大灣區的總人口已經超過8 700萬，地區生產總值超過14.5萬億元人民幣。區內居民自然希望有更多元的資產配置選擇。「跨境理財通」的推出和在其後的優化，讓更多大灣區的民眾可以接觸到香港多元和優質的財管產品與服務。截至二○二五年七月底，參與「跨境理財通」的個人投資者超過16萬人，總跨境匯劃金額超過1,200億元人民幣。

我們會繼續做好服務、優化產品，在中央有關部委的支持下，適時、適度擴大「跨境理財通」覆蓋的地域範圍、產品種類和參與群體。

「跨境理財通」以外，在中央的大力支持下，特區政府會繼續致力深化與內地金融市場的互聯互通，積極探索各項擴容增量方案，以穩妥和循序漸進的方式擴大互聯互通機制下的產品種類和涵蓋範圍，豐富內地投資者的選擇。

就吸引海外資金方面，我們也是多管齊下。例如，我們推出了多項政策措施，包括稅務優惠，吸引家族辦公室落戶香港。特區政府每年舉辦的「裕澤香江」高峰論壇，參加者來自東南亞、中東、歐美等地，展示了香港國際家族辦公室樞紐的地位。

在產品方面，我們也努力不斷創新，交易所買賣產品就是一個例子。它是一個正在蓬勃發展的市場，目前，在港交所（香港交易及結算所有限公司）上市的ETP（交易所買賣產品）超過210隻，種類非常多元化，包括投資不同地域的證券、衍生產品，以至數字資產等，佔股市成交量超過15%。我們會繼續把這個市場發展好，並進一步提升它在互聯互通機制內的貢獻。

此外，香港私募基金、風投基金的生態也十分蓬勃，管理資產規模接近2,300億美元，在亞洲僅次於內地。我們正穩慎推動開放更多私募基金給予零售投資者，豐富他們的選擇，也助力業界發展。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，一直以來，中金公司是國家金融市場的重要參與者與建設者，在國家金融改革與開放進程，以至金融強國建設中，擔當重要的角色，貢獻良多。我衷心感謝中金公司利用香港作為境外業務的樞紐，並推動內地企業通過香港「走出去」，又把優質國際資本「引進來」。我深信中金公司會繼續積極發揮資本市場投融資領頭羊的功能，助力香港提升金融市場的活力與競爭力，為國家金融強國建設作出新的、更大的貢獻。

最後，祝願今日的峰會圓滿成功，中金公司業務竿頭猛進，各位嘉賓、各位朋友身體健康、事業宏達！謝謝大家！"
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-11 06:48,2025-09-11 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100168.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 11) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

大家好。我簡單講幾句。今晚非常高興——甚至有點小興奮——出席《大狀王》香港第三度公演閉幕酒會，與各位一同欣賞這部載譽歸來音樂劇的精彩演出。

《大狀王》自二○二二年首演以來，叫好叫座、越做越爆紅，不但在香港一票難求，在上海及北京巡演時亦大受好評，創下香港音樂劇在內地演出場次及觀眾人次的紀錄。《大狀王》至今已斬獲近30個重要獎項，是香港原創粵語音樂劇的神級里程碑之作，擦亮香港表演藝術的金漆招牌。

《大狀王》的成功，是「十年磨一劍」的成果。團隊以「一班人、一條心、講好一個故事」的信念，從構思、籌備和創作，千錘百煉，精雕細琢出一套細膩、充滿香港特色的音樂劇，融匯粵劇、古典、搖滾等多種音樂風格，舞台設計亦結合古今美學，充分展現香港文化中西合璧的特性，和創意蓬勃、多元共生的文化實力。

我祝賀《大狀王》團隊獲得空前的成功，希望你們日後能夠為我們帶來更多精彩的演出。我亦感謝西九文化區與香港話劇團合作，推動本地藝術發展，不但為觀眾帶來驚豔的視聽體驗，更成就了一批出色的演藝人才，推動本地文化藝術創意項目走向更廣闊的舞台。

最後，我期待香港繼續湧現更多優秀的原創作品，向世界弘揚中華文化，說好中國故事、香港故事。

多謝大家！"

10th Belt and Road Summit explores new opportunities and drives collaboration for a shared future (with photos),2025-09-10 20:56,2025-09-10 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000749.htm,"ããThe 10th Belt and Road Summit which opened today (September 10) and runs for two days brought together over 6 000 participants, including more than 90 government and business speakers, as well as over 100 delegations, to explore the opportunities arising from areas such as trade and commerce, investment, innovation and technology and green development, and yielded a record high of about 50 government and enterprise memorandums of understanding (MOUs), highlighting Hong Kong’s role as the functional platform for the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI).

ããHosted by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government since 2016, the Summit is a flagship event for Hong Kong’s participation in and contribution to the B&RI, and has become the premier B&R business and investment platform for local, Mainland and overseas enterprises. Under the theme ""Collaborate for change • Shape a shared future"", the 10th Summit featured new elements such as market spotlights, signature projects and collaborative capacity for sustainable development, exploring further collaboration opportunities for enterprises, the local professional services sectors and people-to-people exchanges.

  Speaking at the opening session, the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, said the Belt and Road Summit has united governments, businesses, peoples and cultures in collaboration for change. He said that over the past 10 years, more than 45 000 people from some 120 countries and regions have participated in the summit, with over 2 800 projects presented, shaping a shared vision through collaboration and connectivity, which are the fundamental values of the B&RI.

  Mr Lee said, ""The HKSAR Government is rapidly expanding Hong Kong's global trade networks. I have visited 12 Belt and Road countries in the past three years, leading high-level business delegations from Hong Kong to most of them and witnessing some 160 MOUs, and co-operation agreements and deliverables with the respective economies. We have signed free trade agreements with 14 Belt and Road countries, and investment agreements with about 20 Belt and Road economies, as well as Comprehensive Avoidence of Double Taxation Agreements with 37 Belt and Road jurisdictions. Our external trade with Belt and Road countries exceeded US$276 billion last year, up about 80 per cent since 2013 and three times the average growth rate of Hong Kong's external merchandise trade over the same period. ""

  Mr Lee also introduced Hong Kong's advantages and developments in such areas as trade and investment, competitiveness, talent, connectivity, green and sustainable development and the legal system, highlighting that Hong Kong is an ideal B&R hub. He remarked that as the only world city that converges both the China advantage and the global advantage, Hong Kong stands as the premier gateway for co-operation, bridging people, trade, business, education, culture and values across the region, connecting Asia and the world. He said that Hong Kong's ""dual superpower"" as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" injects vigour, innovation, sustainability and strategic value to capital and projects, and will continue to drive high-quality development along the B&R.

  Also addressing the opening session were Vice Minister of Commerce Mr Yan Dong; Vice Chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council Mr Li Zhen; and Deputy Secretary General of the National Development and Reform Commission Mr Xiao Weiming. Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia Mr Sun Chanthol delivered a keynote speech at the opening session.

  The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, gave welcome remarks at the Keynote Luncheon titled ""Fostering Regional Co-operation through Concrete Business Partnerships"". He shared with the audience how Hong Kong is fostering more partnerships and contributing to regional connectivity through leveraging on two important global trends - green and sustainable development, and digital innovation.

  On green and sustainable development, Mr Chan highlighted the Government’s vision for Hong Kong to become an international centre for green technology and green finance, playing its pivotal role in driving global green transition. In the area of green finance, the Government is actively promoting the development of transition finance, while also addressing the diverse needs of emerging economies through innovative financial instruments such as catastrophe bonds and the securitisation of infrastructure debt. At the same time, Hong Kong is accelerating its development into a green technology hub, contributing to regional decarbonisation efforts through cutting-edge innovation.

  Turning to digital innovation, Mr Chan said that for Belt and Road economies and the Global South, Hong Kong and the Mainland offers a wide spectrum of digital solutions, from fintech and smart health to cloud computing, 6G, and digital city management. Hong Kong has made AI one of our key strategic priorities, and is committed to building an open, collaborative and inclusive AI community. Meanwhile, it is embracing blockchain technology at the heart of financial innovation, leveraging on its potential to make cross-border transactions more efficient.

  The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, gave welcome remarks at the thematic breakout session titled ""Synergy in Legal Solutions: Co-creating a Shared Silk Road Vision"". He stated that the conclusion and execution of Belt and Road projects are bound to involve transboundary legal issues, in which international legal services are inevitable. Noting that Hong Kong international civil and commercial law and practice under its common law system are highly recognised by the international business community, Mr Lam highlighted Hong Kong’s advantages in various areas including the abundant legal professionals with rich experiences in international business law, credible and high-quality legal and dispute resolution services, and close legal collaborations with Belt and Road countries.

  The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, chaired the policy dialogue on ""Embracing emerging opportunities in times of economic uncertainty"" at which he discussed with overseas government officials on forging economic co-operation with innovation, such as green economy and digitalisation, amid the uncertain geopolitical situation. Mr Yau also highlighted that the B&RI provides a readily available platform for international co-operation in facilitating trade and economic integration. Citing infrastructure development as one of the key strengths of the B&RI, he said that it helps enhance market access and reduce trade barriers, thereby generating investment, creating jobs and improving living standards.

  The Summit featured nine MOUs between the HKSAR Government and related organisations and their overseas counterparts to promote bilateral co-operation and exchanges, covering the Department of Justice, the Financial Services Development Council, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, Hong Kong Customs, the Hong Kong Observatory, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Invest Hong Kong and the Securities and Futures Commission, and Pakistan, Indonesia, Hungary, Qatar, Cambodia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The Summit also led to some 36 other MOUs in various areas. The total value of these MOUs, together with new projects and deals finalised before the summit, is close to US$1 billion.

  Under the themes of ""ASEAN: Unveiling new opportunities for growth and collaboration"" and ""Exploring frontiers in new markets and industries"", the plenary sessions gathered business leaders to discuss Hong Kong's role in facilitating trade and business co-operation under the B&RI. A number of thematic breakout sessions covering areas such as legal services, trade and commerce, insurance, architecture, green finance and logistics were also held to focus on fostering a more prosperous, green and interconnected future for B&R countries and regions.

  The HKSAR Government is proactively expanding overseas markets, especially the markets of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Middle East which present great potentials. The new B&R signature projects sessions at the Summit introduced tenders of urban development projects in Thailand and Saudi Arabia. The Belt and Road Office (BRO), together with the Hong Kong Construction Industry Council and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, launched an information sharing mechanism to assist Hong Kong enterprises and professional services in tapping the business opportunities in projects in ASEAN and the Middle East.

  The Summit was attended by over 200 Belt and Road Scholarship recipients, local university students, Youth Link members and Youth Development Commission Youth Ambassadors. A Youth Chapter will be held tomorrow (September 11) for young business leaders from Hong Kong, the Mainland and B&R countries to share their experience. The chapter’s new feature to foster exchanges among the participants will enable them to learn more about the latest B&R developments and opportunities.

  For enhanced synergies, the Government has encouraged various groups and organisations to host more than 20 B&R-related activities in the months around the Summit period, covering areas such as trade and business, arts and culture, music, sports and academia, for the business and professional sectors as well as the general public to take part and experience in person the achievements of global collaboration under the B&RI. The BRO also published a booklet on Hong Kong as a participant, contributor and beneficiary of the B&RI. Details of the activities and the booklet are available on the BRO’s website www.beltandroad.gov.hk."

10th Belt and Road Summit explores new opportunities and drives collaboration for a shared future,2025-09-10 20:56,2025-09-10 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000749.htm,"ããThe 10th Belt and Road Summit which opened today (September 10) and runs for two days brought together over 6 000 participants, including more than 90 government and business speakers, as well as over 100 delegations, to explore the opportunities arising from areas such as trade and commerce, investment, innovation and technology and green development, and yielded a record high of about 50 government and enterprise memorandums of understanding (MOUs), highlighting Hong Kong’s role as the functional platform for the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI).

ããHosted by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government since 2016, the Summit is a flagship event for Hong Kong’s participation in and contribution to the B&RI, and has become the premier B&R business and investment platform for local, Mainland and overseas enterprises. Under the theme ""Collaborate for change • Shape a shared future"", the 10th Summit featured new elements such as market spotlights, signature projects and collaborative capacity for sustainable development, exploring further collaboration opportunities for enterprises, the local professional services sectors and people-to-people exchanges.

  Speaking at the opening session, the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, said the Belt and Road Summit has united governments, businesses, peoples and cultures in collaboration for change. He said that over the past 10 years, more than 45 000 people from some 120 countries and regions have participated in the summit, with over 2 800 projects presented, shaping a shared vision through collaboration and connectivity, which are the fundamental values of the B&RI.

  Mr Lee said, ""The HKSAR Government is rapidly expanding Hong Kong's global trade networks. I have visited 12 Belt and Road countries in the past three years, leading high-level business delegations from Hong Kong to most of them and witnessing some 160 MOUs, and co-operation agreements and deliverables with the respective economies. We have signed free trade agreements with 14 Belt and Road countries, and investment agreements with about 20 Belt and Road economies, as well as Comprehensive Avoidence of Double Taxation Agreements with 37 Belt and Road jurisdictions. Our external trade with Belt and Road countries exceeded US$276 billion last year, up about 80 per cent since 2013 and three times the average growth rate of Hong Kong's external merchandise trade over the same period. ""

  Mr Lee also introduced Hong Kong's advantages and developments in such areas as trade and investment, competitiveness, talent, connectivity, green and sustainable development and the legal system, highlighting that Hong Kong is an ideal B&R hub. He remarked that as the only world city that converges both the China advantage and the global advantage, Hong Kong stands as the premier gateway for co-operation, bridging people, trade, business, education, culture and values across the region, connecting Asia and the world. He said that Hong Kong's ""dual superpower"" as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" injects vigour, innovation, sustainability and strategic value to capital and projects, and will continue to drive high-quality development along the B&R.

  Also addressing the opening session were Vice Minister of Commerce Mr Yan Dong; Vice Chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council Mr Li Zhen; and Deputy Secretary General of the National Development and Reform Commission Mr Xiao Weiming. Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia Mr Sun Chanthol delivered a keynote speech at the opening session.

  The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, gave welcome remarks at the Keynote Luncheon titled ""Fostering Regional Co-operation through Concrete Business Partnerships"". He shared with the audience how Hong Kong is fostering more partnerships and contributing to regional connectivity through leveraging on two important global trends - green and sustainable development, and digital innovation.

  On green and sustainable development, Mr Chan highlighted the Government’s vision for Hong Kong to become an international centre for green technology and green finance, playing its pivotal role in driving global green transition. In the area of green finance, the Government is actively promoting the development of transition finance, while also addressing the diverse needs of emerging economies through innovative financial instruments such as catastrophe bonds and the securitisation of infrastructure debt. At the same time, Hong Kong is accelerating its development into a green technology hub, contributing to regional decarbonisation efforts through cutting-edge innovation.

  Turning to digital innovation, Mr Chan said that for Belt and Road economies and the Global South, Hong Kong and the Mainland offers a wide spectrum of digital solutions, from fintech and smart health to cloud computing, 6G, and digital city management. Hong Kong has made AI one of our key strategic priorities, and is committed to building an open, collaborative and inclusive AI community. Meanwhile, it is embracing blockchain technology at the heart of financial innovation, leveraging on its potential to make cross-border transactions more efficient.

  The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, gave welcome remarks at the thematic breakout session titled ""Synergy in Legal Solutions: Co-creating a Shared Silk Road Vision"". He stated that the conclusion and execution of Belt and Road projects are bound to involve transboundary legal issues, in which international legal services are inevitable. Noting that Hong Kong international civil and commercial law and practice under its common law system are highly recognised by the international business community, Mr Lam highlighted Hong Kong’s advantages in various areas including the abundant legal professionals with rich experiences in international business law, credible and high-quality legal and dispute resolution services, and close legal collaborations with Belt and Road countries.

  The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, chaired the policy dialogue on ""Embracing emerging opportunities in times of economic uncertainty"" at which he discussed with overseas government officials on forging economic co-operation with innovation, such as green economy and digitalisation, amid the uncertain geopolitical situation. Mr Yau also highlighted that the B&RI provides a readily available platform for international co-operation in facilitating trade and economic integration. Citing infrastructure development as one of the key strengths of the B&RI, he said that it helps enhance market access and reduce trade barriers, thereby generating investment, creating jobs and improving living standards.

  The Summit featured nine MOUs between the HKSAR Government and related organisations and their overseas counterparts to promote bilateral co-operation and exchanges, covering the Department of Justice, the Financial Services Development Council, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, Hong Kong Customs, the Hong Kong Observatory, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Invest Hong Kong and the Securities and Futures Commission, and Pakistan, Indonesia, Hungary, Qatar, Cambodia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The Summit also led to some 36 other MOUs in various areas. The total value of these MOUs, together with new projects and deals finalised before the summit, is close to US$1 billion.

  Under the themes of ""ASEAN: Unveiling new opportunities for growth and collaboration"" and ""Exploring frontiers in new markets and industries"", the plenary sessions gathered business leaders to discuss Hong Kong's role in facilitating trade and business co-operation under the B&RI. A number of thematic breakout sessions covering areas such as legal services, trade and commerce, insurance, architecture, green finance and logistics were also held to focus on fostering a more prosperous, green and interconnected future for B&R countries and regions.

  The HKSAR Government is proactively expanding overseas markets, especially the markets of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Middle East which present great potentials. The new B&R signature projects sessions at the Summit introduced tenders of urban development projects in Thailand and Saudi Arabia. The Belt and Road Office (BRO), together with the Hong Kong Construction Industry Council and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, launched an information sharing mechanism to assist Hong Kong enterprises and professional services in tapping the business opportunities in projects in ASEAN and the Middle East.

  The Summit was attended by over 200 Belt and Road Scholarship recipients, local university students, Youth Link members and Youth Development Commission Youth Ambassadors. A Youth Chapter will be held tomorrow (September 11) for young business leaders from Hong Kong, the Mainland and B&R countries to share their experience. The chapter’s new feature to foster exchanges among the participants will enable them to learn more about the latest B&R developments and opportunities.

  For enhanced synergies, the Government has encouraged various groups and organisations to host more than 20 B&R-related activities in the months around the Summit period, covering areas such as trade and business, arts and culture, music, sports and academia, for the business and professional sectors as well as the general public to take part and experience in person the achievements of global collaboration under the B&RI. The BRO also published a booklet on Hong Kong as a participant, contributor and beneficiary of the B&RI. Details of the activities and the booklet are available on the BRO’s website www.beltandroad.gov.hk."

鄧務貴總監（紫荊文化集團影視藝術總監）、陳新育先生（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室宣傳文體部二級巡視員）、丁凱理事長（南方電影文化基金會執委會理事長）、朱皓峰團長（中國內地電影代表團團長）、張康達理事長（華南電影工作者聯合會理事長）、各位嘉賓、傳媒和觀眾朋友：

大家晚上好！歡迎出席「中國內地電影展2025」開幕典禮。

中國電影歷史經歷百年精彩，從黑白到高清，從稚嫩到成熟，近年更在世界舞台大放異彩。大家應該還記得今年農曆新年，《哪吒之魔童鬧海》以高超的製作技術和精彩的敍事手法取得全球電影票房榜第五名的佳績、動畫電影更是全球票房榜第一名。目前，中國已穩居全球第二大電影市場，為世界電影產業發展注入了強勁的動能、多元的創意和無窮的活力。

在國家「十四五」規劃的明確支持下，香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心，可持續發揮獨特的優勢，協助國家將電影業的影響力擴展至全世界。舉辦中國內地電影展，正正是為國家打開面向世界的窗口，以電影作為橋樑，跨越國界，連接心靈，促進文明互鑑。

今年電影展的開幕電影、大家待會會觀賞的《天堂旅行團》，由同名的暢銷小說改編而成，延續書中對生命意義的探討。講述兩位主人翁，一大一小，踏上未知的旅程，追尋生命的曙光，縱使面對逆境亦不放棄，以歡笑與淚水互相治癒的故事，再一次印證電影如何讓觀眾從中獲得勇氣與力量，克服生活中的困難，稍後請大家細心欣賞。

除了開幕電影外，正如司儀剛才介紹，電影展亦精選了11部由年輕導演執導的作品。這些電影涵蓋不同類型，以敏銳的視角、嶄新的手法和不斷求索的精神，從不同角度反映內地的社會現況，商業和藝術元素兼備，充分體現內地電影業的多彩、蓬勃發展。本屆中國內地電影展亦特別舉辦映後談、社區及大專院校免費放映會等一連串活動，希望通過互動交流，讓市民從更多角度欣賞百花齊放的內地電影業。

康樂及文化事務署一直致力推廣中國歷史和文化，「中國內地電影展」是弘揚中華文化系列活動之一，希望透過電影讓市民大眾認識博大精深的中華文化。今年二月，特區政府通過電影發展基金推出弘揚中華文化電影製作資助計劃，鼓勵香港導演將中華文化元素融入電影作品中，宣揚中華文化的魅力和多樣性，向觀眾展示中華文化的優秀傳統。

歷屆電影展能夠順利舉行，全賴各方緊密合作。在此，我衷心感謝湖南電影代表來港出席今晚的開幕典禮。此外，我謹代表香港特別行政區政府，向紫荊文化集團致以誠摯的謝意，並向南方電影文化基金會、銀都機構有限公司、華南電影工作者聯合會和中國電影基金會等合作夥伴一一致謝。

我祝願本屆電影展圓滿成功，並祝在座各位身體安康，謝謝大家。"

政府發言人說：「政府一直尊重法治，履行終審法院裁決的要求，提出《條例草案》亦是履行《基本法》下行政機關提出法案的責任。立法會根據《基本法》有審議法案的職能和權力。政府尊重立法會的決定和議員的投票結果。」

「這次《條例草案》的提出和審議是行政、立法、司法機關履行其憲制職能的責任承擔，各司其職。」

「同性伴侶關係議題極具爭議，社會上不同持份者有不同看法。政府尊重法治，按法庭的裁決，向立法會提交一個替代框架的建議。《條例草案》被否決，政府不會向法院申請延長暫緩令期限，會與律政司就議題作商討和研究。」"
政制及內地事務局局長會見傳媒談話內容,2025-09-10 20:17,2025-09-10 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000762.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞今日（九月十日）在立法會會議二讀辯論《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》後會見傳媒的談話內容：

政制及內地事務局局長：各位傳媒朋友，大家好。相信大家都知道，立法會剛剛完成投票，以大比數反對二讀《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》（《條例草案》）。今次《條例草案》未獲通過，政府當然會感到失望，但這畢竟是立法會行使《基本法》下負責審議、制定法案的職能和權力，立法會議員是反映社會各界和市民意見的代議士，既然議員認為《條例草案》未能反映現時香港社會的主流意見，未能凝聚共識，政府會尊重立法會的決定和投票結果。我再次感謝各位議員在審議期間盡責履職，認真審議今次《條例草案》，這亦反映立法會的認真專業態度和對法庭裁決的尊重。

政府亦再次重申，政府尊重法治，尊重法院的裁決。今次推出《條例草案》的目的正是履行終審法院就岑子杰案宣告政府根據《香港人權法案》第十四條須履行的積極義務，即透過立法制定替代框架，讓同性伴侶關係獲得法律的承認，並制定伴隨的適當權利和責任。政府的立法建議充分考慮了法院的裁決要求、香港的實際情況、傳統價值觀、社會的和諧穩定以及整體利益，並在當中取得適當平衡，以形成社會上的「最大公約數」。事實上，即使在世界各地，不同地方亦會按照其憲制傳統、法律程序和社會價值觀去制定合適的法律。

而在整個推進立法的過程中，政府已盡最大努力，爭取社會和立法會的支持，在終審法院定下的暫緩限期內履行有關積極義務。雖然今次立法會的表決結果並未能與政府的立法建議一致，但就行政、立法、司法機關各自按照《基本法》履行其憲制責任和職能而言，卻起了積極的示範作用，充分顯示其各司其職，相互尊重，並有效發揮其功能，共同致力維護香港整體利益和社會和諧穩定。

政府亦明白，關注同性伴侶權益的人士和團體或者會對今次立法會的表決結果感到失望。然而，香港作為一個多元包容的社會，社會存在不同的聲音和意見是十分正常的事情，政府亦希望大家能以理性的態度對待今次的結果。雖然大家的價值觀和觀點有所不同，但我們必須珍惜和維護我們得來不易的社會團結及和諧穩定。

對香港同性伴侶而言，即使今日《條例草案》未獲通過，但他們的權利在不同方面亦受到保障，包括經法庭裁決而確認在不同範疇上可享有的權利和保障，例如申請受養人簽證來港居留、評稅安排、申請公屋以及繼承遺產等。

政府已經按照法庭的裁決，向立法會提交一個替代框架的建議，而《條例草案》被否決，政府亦不會向法院申請延長暫緩令的期限。下一步，我們會與律政司就議題作進一步商討和研究。

記者：政府早前表示提出《條例草案》是為了維護法治，現時立法會否決《條例草案》，是否表示特區的法治會受到嚴重影響？

政制及內地事務局局長：政府一向強調，我們十分尊重法治，尊重法庭的裁決。正因如此，我們因應法庭的裁決，推出今次的《條例草案》，以履行我們在《人權法》下的積極義務。而整個立法過程中，大家都有目共睹，由條例草擬、方案制訂，以至推出條例、種種向立法會和公眾的解說和游說工作，都證明我們盡最大努力，希望達致方案完成，獲得立法會支持通過。至於立法會方面，大家亦留意到，立法會議員自方案推出以來，都盡責履職，專業認真地審議法案，同時亦收取不同的公眾意見，在會議上如實反映。這些都反映大家對香港的法治，以至法庭的裁決十分尊重。因此，我們不認為香港的法治會因為這樣而受到任何衝擊或影響。相反地，在目前的政治架構安排上，行政、立法和司法各司其職，相互尊重下，在法治的前提下進行各方面工作。

記者：立法會現在已經否決了《條例草案》，政府下一步的工作是甚麽？剛才局長說政府在現階段不會申請延期，即如何履行持續的積極義務以遵守法院的命令？

政制及內地事務局局長：正如我剛才所說，我們下一步會與律政司進一步商討，研究下一步的工作怎樣進行。至於延期方面，目前我們不會向法院申請延期。主要來說，因為大家看到，今次推出的法案，以至法案未獲通過，無論立法會各議員、政黨，以至市民各方面都存在很大的分歧，暫時仍未形成共識，這正正反映問題的複雜性和敏感性。我們相信政府需要時間進一步進行研究。目前，在未有具體的工作計劃和時間表的情況下，我們暫時沒有基礎向法庭申請延期。

記者：政府推出《條例草案》的目的是履行法院的裁決，但現時《條例草案》得不到立法會的支持，這情況會否造成行政、立法、司法不協調甚至憲制上的危機呢？

政制及內地事務局局長：今次行政機關是按照司法機關的裁決實施立法建議，亦一直很努力推進立法工作；至於立法會方面，亦見到他們因應立法建議，作出認真的審議，盡責履職地進行審議工作，其間亦提出很多寶貴意見，聽取很多市民意見，在議會上作出如實反映。這次無論在行政、立法及司法，三方面都相互很有效地運作，在各司其職、互相尊重的情況下，我不認為存在所謂的不協調情況，甚至憲制危機。我完全看不到這個情況。

Reporter: Now that the Bill was voted down, what would be the Government's next step and whether the Government would seek extension of time from the Court? Would there be any adverse impact to the rule of law of Hong Kong?

Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs: As I just said, the Government is not going to apply for any extension of time from the Court for the moment but we will further discuss with the DoJ (Department of Justice) to see how to take forward the matter.

As regards the rule of law of Hong Kong, the Government has all along fully respected the rule of law of Hong Kong as well as the Court's ruling. And that's why we introduced the Bill this time to discharge our positive obligations under the Hong Kong BoR (Bill of Rights) as ruled by the court. And throughout the whole legislative process, you can see that from our detailed analysis of the judgement to see how to fulfil the requirements as set out by the court, to the drafting of the Bill, the introduction of the Bill, and also all the explanatory and lobbying work that we have done to solicit support from the Legislative Council as well as the public. You can see that we have tried our best to pursue the legislative process as well as to fulfil our obligations. As regards of the Legislative Council, you can see that they have dutifully and effectively discharged their functions and obligations under the Basic Law to closely scrutinise the Bill, and to render advice to the Government, and also to reflect the views of the public to us. So, I don't see any question about the rule of law of Hong Kong being adversely affected in any way. Thank you.

立法會十八題：預防蚊傳疾病,2025-09-10 19:06,2025-09-10 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000674.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上梁文廣議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

衞生署衞生防護中心指出，隨着夏季氣溫及雨量上升，蚊傳疾病（包括基孔肯雅熱及登革熱）的傳播風險增加。據報香港鄰近地區已出現基孔肯亞熱的疫情，而登革熱在過往夏季亦曾出現本地爆發。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年本港每年錄得的基孔肯雅熱及登革熱個案數目分別為何，以及當中分別有多少宗屬本地及輸入個案；

（二）過去三個月，在各口岸的健康篩檢工作中發現多少宗發燒個案，以及當中有多少宗最終確診為蚊傳疾病；

（三）衞生署如何在各口岸（包括各陸路口岸及機場）加強對來自蚊傳疾病高風險地區旅客的健康篩檢工作，例如會否考慮為出現相關病徵的旅客和相關航班乘客進行快速檢測，以縮短確診蚊傳疾病時間；

（四）食物環境衞生署及相關政府部門如何加強本港蚊患嚴重地區的滅蚊工作，以及今年至今的滅蚊工作詳情為何；及

（五）政府會否考慮引入新技術以提升滅蚊效率？

答覆：

主席：

衞生署衞生防護中心一直密切監察世界各地蚊傳疾病（包括問題提及的登革熱和基孔肯雅熱）的情況。

就登革熱，世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，全球發病率在過去二十年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。登革熱患者可能會出現高燒、嚴重頭痛、眼窩後疼痛、肌肉及關節痛、噁心、嘔吐、淋巴結腫脹及出疹。有些人在感染後沒有明顯病徵，有些則只有發熱及出疹等輕微及不明確病徵。第一次感染的病情一般較輕，病癒後對該血清型病毒會產生終生免疫能力，但對其他三種血清型病毒只有部分和短暫的交叉免疫能力。若隨後感染其他血清型的登革熱病毒，出現重症登革熱的機會則較高，可導致死亡。在二○二三年，全球80多個國家／地區曾經錄得本地傳播個案，共呈報了逾650萬宗病例（包括7 300多宗死亡個案），而二○二四年更錄得超過1 400萬宗病例，創歷史新高。

就基孔肯雅熱而言，世衞資料顯示全球超過110個國家／地區曾經錄得本地傳播個案。患者可能會出現發燒和嚴重關節痛。由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，並多數與其他已存在的健康問題有關。大部分患者可以完全痊癒。今年一月至七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗病例，當中約90宗為死亡個案。亞洲方面，二○二五年印度及印度尼西亞分別錄得超過32 000宗及17 000宗病例，其他錄得病例的地區包括內地、孟加拉國及斯里蘭卡等。廣東省（尤其佛山市）自七月起錄得超過10 000宗基孔肯雅熱病例，病情一般輕微而當中沒有死亡個案，情況在八月下旬已受到控制，每日只有零星新增個案。自七月開始本港亦錄得從世界各地有病例地區的零星輸入個案，顯示爆發風險依然存在，市民不應掉以輕心。

另外，日本腦炎也是一種經蚊子傳播的疾病，而香港亦曾錄得輸入個案。日本腦炎主要流行於亞洲及西太平洋地區的郊外及農村，尤其在氣候炎熱的季節。大部分病人均病情輕微，除發燒及頭痛外，一般不會有其他顯著病徵，但每250宗感染中便大約有一宗會出現嚴重病情，病徵包括迅速出現高燒、頭痛、頸部僵硬、喪失方向知覺、昏迷、抽搐、痙攣性癱瘓，甚至死亡。

白紋伊蚊是登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的傳播媒介，而日本腦炎的主要病媒蚊是庫蚊。針對蚊傳疾病的防控，防蚊滅蚊工作至為重要。在環境及生態局主持的跨部門防治蟲鼠督導委員會下，相關政府政策局及部門已實施多項預防及控制蚊傳疾病的措施。

就梁文廣議員的提問，經諮詢環境及生態局和衞生署後，本局現回覆如下：

（一）登革熱方面，本港於過去五年（二○二○至二○二四年）每年錄得2至161宗個案，大部分為輸入個案。截至二○二五年九月四日，本港今年累計錄得44宗登革熱個案，全部為輸入個案，來自印度、印度尼西亞、菲律賓、泰國、馬來西亞、柬埔寨、斐濟、斯里蘭卡、孟加拉國及新加坡。詳細數字載於下表。

基孔肯雅熱方面，本港於過去五年（二○二○至二○二四年）未有錄得任何個案。截至二○二五年九月四日，本港今年累計錄得13宗基孔肯雅熱個案，全部屬輸入個案，七宗來自中國內地（廣東省佛山市）、四宗來自孟加拉國、一宗來自印度尼西亞及一宗來自斯里蘭卡。

日本腦炎方面，本港過去五年（二○二○至二○二四年）沒有錄得個案。截至二○二五年九月四日，本港今年錄得一宗輸入個案，來自菲律賓。

（二）於二○二五年六月至八月期間，衞生署於口岸健康篩查中，發現991宗入境旅客發燒個案，當中沒有確診蚊傳疾病的個案。

（三）衞生署在所有跨境口岸（即香港國際機場及連接廣東省的各個陸路及水路口岸）執行對入境人士的健康篩檢措施，包括進行體溫檢測及按機制為發燒個案或有病徵的旅客（例如自行申報不適的旅客）作進一步健康評估，並透過填寫健康評估表，了解其病徵、旅遊史及接觸史等，以便作出適切轉介及跟進。

自廣東省衞生當局於今年七月中報告基孔肯雅熱疫情，衞生署港口衞生科跟深圳海關保持緊密聯繫，並深化雙方通報機制，確保兩地口岸的防控措施能順利執行。若有發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客經港口衞生科人員評估後被懷疑患有基孔肯雅熱，會立即被安排轉送至香港公立醫院作跟進處理。至今未在口岸發現懷疑基孔肯雅熱個案。

衞生署港口衞生科會繼續與相關持份者（如航空公司及旅遊業界等）保持緊密聯繫，適時更新疾病資訊和健康建議；港口衞生科人員亦會嚴格監控各口岸的環境衞生，加強巡查，全面落實口岸防蚊及控蚊措施，確保良好環境衞生及病媒控制工作到位。

蚊傳疾病（包括登革熱、基孔肯雅熱和日本腦炎）的潛伏期較長，甚至可達約兩星期，單靠入境時的港口衞生措施偵測感染個案的效用並不顯著。與此同時，登革熱和基孔肯雅熱感染者血液內的病毒含量一般而言在發病後首數日最高，因此在病發初期的準確診斷需要通過對患者血液進行病毒核酸測試。登革熱和基孔肯雅熱核酸檢測產品亦需在實驗室由專業人員使用，目前市面上並沒有獲國際衞生當局認證可供實驗室以外自行使用的相關快速核酸測試產品。至於市面上的基孔肯雅熱快速檢測，是針對患者體內的抗體作測試。由於身體感染基孔肯雅熱後一般需要大約一星期才會對基孔肯雅病毒產生抗體，因此相關快速檢測不適合用於病發初期，會出現假陰性情況，亦不能縮短確診時間。

（四）各政府部門一直積極採取防蚊滅蚊措施。環境及生態局分別在今年三月和七月召開跨部門防治蟲鼠督導委員會會議，檢視蚊患最新情況和各部門的防治蚊患工作。在跨部門協調機制下，食物環境衞生署（食環署）和各相關部門已進行一系列防治蚊患工作，並因應鄰近地區出現基孔肯亞熱個案的情況採取多項加強措施，詳情如下︰

病媒監測

食環署持續在全港不同地點放置誘蚊器，以監察可傳播登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生情況，並通過部門網頁及政府地理空間信息樞紐平台，定期公布各分區誘蚊器指數，讓各部門和持份者可因應監察結果採取針對性滅蚊措施。為進一步加強防控，食環署自今年八月起將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時啓動的強化控蚊工作，擴展至指數介乎10%至20%的區域。食環署會在有關區域進行詳細風險評估，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，聯同各部門及持份者進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作，亦會通知附近屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

減少蚊子滋生地點及滅蚊

食環署防治蚊患的工作以環境防治為核心，着重減少蚊子滋生地點，並運用生物或化學方法，包括施放殺幼蟲劑和進行霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，從而控制蚊子數量。今年一月至八月期間，食環署各分區共進行逾22 000次霧化處理殺滅成蚊行動。

另外，食環署亦加強巡查建築地盤及工地等高危地點。今年一月至八月期間，食環署共提出103宗檢控，包括95宗涉及建築地盤，8宗涉及其他處所。自今年八月，食環署已向建築地盤及工地發出逾200張法定通知，指示其清理積水。

跨部門及跨界別協作

食環署在全港各分區均召開「跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組」特別會議，協調相關部門和持份者聯手採取針對性及持久性的防蚊滅蚊措施，包括積極在轄下處所和場地採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

食環署並已發信予物業管理及防治蟲鼠業界，呼籲向其負責管理屋苑的業戶或工作單位宣傳和落實滅蚊措施。此外，食環署已與物業管理業監管局和衞生防護中心合作舉辦大型講座，向約3 000名物管業界人員介紹基孔肯雅熱防控資訊。

食環署亦聯同發展局，透過建造業議會向200多個地盤及相關人員發出《給建築地盤的防蚊指引》，提醒從業員做好防治蚊患工作及個人防護；及在新學年開始前，透過教育局向全港逾2 000所學校（包括幼稚園、中小學）發出《給學校的防蚊指引》，協助校方防範蚊傳疾病傳播的風險。

（五）食環署會持續應用科技以加強滅蚊成效，例如引入2 000多個新型捕蚊器，即利用成蚊作為載體，把生長調節劑帶到不同水體，使水體中的孑孓不能發育為成蚊，以抑制成蚊的密度。此外，食環署正聯同機電工程署實地試驗利用機械狗在叢林等較難進入的地方進行霧化工作，提升控蚊效果。

食環署會密切留意世衞和各地在滅蚊方面的最新資訊，並研究各種新技術及產品在本港應用的可行性。如有合適的新技術及產品，食環署會積極考慮引入及應用。"
LCQ18: Prevention of mosquito-borne diseases,2025-09-10 19:06,2025-09-10 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000677.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Leung Man-kwong and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health (DH) has pointed out that, with the increase in temperature and rainfall in summer, the risk of transmission of mosquito-borne diseases (including chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF)) increases. It has been reported that outbreaks of CF have occurred in neighbouring areas of Hong Kong, and local outbreaks of DF were seen in past summers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of CF and DF cases recorded in Hong Kong in each of the past five years, and among them, the respective numbers of local and imported cases;

(2) of the number of fever cases detected in the health screening work at various boundary control points (BCPs) in the past three months, and among them, the number of cases eventually confirmed to be mosquito-borne diseases;

(3) how DH will strengthen the health screening work for travellers from areas with high risk of mosquito-borne diseases at various BCPs (including all land BCPs and the airport), for example, whether it will consider conducting rapid tests on travellers showing relevant symptoms and passengers on relevant flights, so as to shorten the time required for confirming mosquito-borne diseases;

(4) how the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and relevant government departments will step up mosquito control efforts in areas with serious mosquito infestation in Hong Kong, and of the details of such mosquito control work so far this year; and

(5) whether the Government will consider introducing new technologies to enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control work?

Reply:

President,

  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) has all along been closely monitoring the global situation of mosquito-borne diseases (including dengue fever (DF) and chikungunya fever (CF) mentioned in the question).

  Regarding DF, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. DF patients may have high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, swollen lymph nodes and rash. Some infected people may not develop apparent symptoms, while some may only have mild and non-specific symptoms such as fever and rash. The symptoms of first infection are usually mild. Once recovered, lifelong immunity to that serotype of dengue virus will develop. However, cross-immunity to the other three serotypes after recovery is only partial and temporary. Subsequent infections with other serotypes of dengue virus are more likely to result in severe dengue or even progress to death. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases (including more than 7 300 deaths) were reported in over 80 countries/regions. In 2024, over 14 million cases were recorded, which was a record high.

  Regarding CF, according to the WHO, CF cases with local transmission have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Patient may suffer from fever and debilitating joint pain. Severe symptoms and deaths from CF are rare and usually related to other coexisting health problems. Most patients recover fully. From January to July this year, more than 240 000 cases were recorded in 16 countries/regions worldwide, including about 90 deaths. In Asia, India and Indonesia recorded more than 32 000 and 17 000 cases respectively in 2025. Other regions that have recorded CF cases include the Mainland, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, etc. Guangdong Province (especially Foshan City) has recorded more than 10 000 CF cases since July. The illness was generally mild with no deaths reported. The situation was under control since late August, with only sporadic new cases reported each day. Since July, Hong Kong has also recorded sporadic imported cases from different places around the world where there are confirmed cases, indicating that the risk of an outbreak still exists and the public should stay vigilant.

  In addition, Japanese encephalitis (JE) is also a mosquito-borne disease and imported cases have also been recorded in Hong Kong. JE occurs mainly in the rural and agricultural areas of Asia and the Western Pacific Region, especially during hot seasons. Most infections occur without apparent symptoms or with mild symptoms such as fever and headache. However, approximately one in every 250 infections is associated with severe illness characterised by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and even death.

  Aedes albopictus is the vector for both DF and CF; and the Culex species is the principal vector for JE. For the prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases, mosquito prevention and control work is of paramount importance. Under the interdepartmental Pest Control Steering Committee (PCSC) convened by the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB), relevant government bureaux and departments have implemented various prevention and control measures against mosquito-borne diseases.

  In response to the Hon Leung Man-kwong's enquiry, our reply in consultation with the EEB and the DH is as follows:

(1) On DF, Hong Kong recorded two to 161 DF cases annually in the past five years (2020 to 2024), with the majority being imported cases. As of September 4, 2025, Hong Kong has recorded 44 DF cases this year, all being imported cases from India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Fiji, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Singapore. Detailed figures are in the following table.

  On CF, no local case has been recorded in Hong Kong in the past five years (2020 to 2024). As of September 4, 2025, Hong Kong has recorded 13 CF cases this year, all being imported cases, with seven cases from the Mainland China (Foshan City of Guangdong Province), four cases from Bangladesh, one case from Indonesia and one case from Sri Lanka.

  On JE, Hong Kong has not recorded any cases in the past five years (2020 to 2024). As of September 4, 2025, Hong Kong has recorded one imported case from the Philippines in 2025.

(2) From June to August 2025, the DH detected 991 fever cases among inbound travellers during health screenings at the boundary control points (BCPs). None of these cases was confirmed to have mosquito-borne diseases.

(3) The DH implements health screening measures for inbound travellers at all cross-border ports (including the Hong Kong International Airport and land and sea ports connecting to the Guangdong Province). These measures involve temperature checks and, when necessary, further health assessments for individuals with fever or those reporting symptoms (e.g. those self-reporting discomfort) according to the established mechanism. A health assessment form is used to gather information on symptoms, travel history and contact history, which enables appropriate referrals and follow-up actions.

  Since reporting of a CF outbreak by the heath authorities of the Guangdong Province in mid-July this year, the Port Health Division (PHD) of the DH has maintained close liaison with Shenzhen Customs and enhanced mutual notification mechanisms to ensure smooth implementation of port control measures. If travellers with fever or related symptoms are suspected of having CF after assessment by PHD staff, they will be immediately referred to public hospitals in Hong Kong for follow-up. No suspected CF cases have been found at the BCPs so far.

  The PHD of the DH continues to maintain close communication with relevant stakeholders (e.g. airlines and tourism industry) to update disease information and health advice promptly. PHD staff will also closely monitor environmental hygiene at all BCPs, strengthen inspections, fully implement mosquito prevention and control work at BCPs, and ensure good environmental hygiene and vector control measures are in place.

  Mosquito-borne diseases (including DF, CF and JE) have a long incubation period, potentially up to about two weeks. Port health measures alone are therefore insufficient to detect infected cases at the place of entry. At the same time, for DF and CF, the viral load in an infected person's blood is the highest in the first few days after symptom onset. Therefore, the diagnosis during the early stage of the diseases is accurate only through viral nucleic acid testing of the patient's blood. DF and CF nucleic acid testing products must be used by professional personnel in laboratory settings. Currently, there are no rapid nucleic acid test products on the market that have been certified by international health authorities for self-testing outside laboratory settings. As for the existing rapid test kits for CF on the market, they target antibodies in patient's body. Since the body typically takes about a week to produce antibodies against the chikungunya virus, such rapid tests are not suitable for use in the early stage of the diseases and may result in false negatives, thereby unable to shorten the time for diagnosis.

(4) All departments concerned have been actively implementing anti-mosquito measures. The EEB held interdepartmental PCSC meetings in March and July this year respectively to review the latest situation of the mosquito problem and the mosquito prevention and control work carried out by various departments. Under the inter-departmental coordination mechanism, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have carried out a series of mosquito prevention and control work, as well as strengthened the related measures in response to CF cases reported in neighbouring regions. The details of the enhanced measures are as follows:

Vector surveillance

  The FEHD continues to place gravidtraps in different areas across Hong Kong for monitoring the infestation of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit DF and CF. The FEHD publishes the Area Gravidtrap Indices (AGI) on its departmental webpage and the Government's Geospatial Information Hub platform on a regular basis, so that government departments and stakeholders can adopt targeted mosquito control measures with respect to the surveillance results. To further step up mosquito prevention and control, since August this year, the FEHD has extended its strengthened mosquito control work, which was originally initiated when the AGI of an area has reached 20 per cent, to also cover areas with AGI between 10 per cent and 20 per cent. The FEHD will conduct detailed risk assessment for the areas concerned to identify locations with more severe mosquito infestation, so as to carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control work jointly with other departments and stakeholders. The FEHD will also notify the nearby housing estates, advising their property management companies and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking anti-mosquito measures.

Minimising mosquito breeding grounds and eliminating mosquitoes

  With the primary focus on environmental control, the FEHD's mosquito prevention and control work focuses on minimising mosquito breeding grounds. Biological or chemical methods, including applying larvicides and conducting fogging operations, are carried out to eliminate adult mosquitoes so as to control their population. From January to August 2025, the FEHD conducted over 22 000 fogging operations across the territory to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

  In addition, the FEHD has stepped up inspections of high-risk locations such as construction sites and works sites. From January to August 2025, the FEHD instituted a total of 103 prosecutions, including 95 cases involving construction sites and eight cases involving other premises. Since August 2025, the FEHD has issued over 200 statutory notices to construction sites and works sites, instructing them to clear stagnant water.

Inter-departmental and cross-sectoral collaboration

  The FEHD has convened special meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to coordinate with relevant departments and stakeholders in implementing targeted and sustained mosquito prevention and control measures, including actively implementing anti-mosquito measures in their respective premises and venues.

  The FEHD issued letters to the property management sector and the pest control sector, calling on them to promote and implement anti-mosquito measures among the residents or work units of the housing estates under their management. Moreover, the FEHD, the Property Management Services Authority and the CHP jointly held a large-scale seminar providing information on the prevention and control measures against CF for about 3 000 practitioners of the property management sector.

  The FEHD has also collaborated with the Development Bureau to issue the ""Guidelines on Mosquito Prevention in Construction Sites"" to over 200 construction sites and relevant personnel through the Construction Industry Council, reminding the practitioners to take appropriate anti-mosquito and personal protective measures. In addition, prior to the start of the new school year, the FEHD issued the ""Guidelines on Mosquito Prevention in Schools"" through the Education Bureau to over 2 000 schools across the territory, including kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools, so as to facilitate preventing the risk of mosquito-borne disease transmission in schools.

(5) The FEHD has been applying technologies to enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control. For example, the FEHD has adopted over 2 000 new mosquito trapping devices, using adult mosquitoes as carriers to carry growth regulators to different water bodies so that larvae in the water bodies cannot develop into adult mosquitoes, to suppress the density of adult mosquitoes. Moreover, the FEHD is working with the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department to conduct on-site trials on robot dogs carrying out fogging operations at inaccessible places such as shrubby areas to enhance the anti-mosquito effectiveness.

  The FEHD will closely monitor the latest information from the WHO and other places concerning mosquito control measures. The FEHD will also study the feasibility of introducing the new technologies and products to Hong Kong. Should any suitable new technologies and products be identified, the FEHD will actively consider their introduction and application."

阮家儀對香港城市文化有著獨特的情感連結及觀察。她喜愛利用收集充滿懷舊韻味的舊物創作藝術裝置，並借助燈光投影技術，喚起觀眾的集體回憶，以及對城市變遷的關注和反思。

兩組作品於香港視覺藝術中心三樓至五樓公共空間展出。《幻影》靈感源自一九九○年代在商場公共區域流行的音樂噴泉。阮家儀巧妙地融合動態光影與承載集體記憶的現成物，例如快餐店兒童餐的玩具、室內遊樂場的揼蟹機等，創作出有趣的立體雕塑。在光影的律動變化中，喚起人們對昔日商場公共空間的記憶，並引發觀眾對消費文化與童年記憶的深刻思考。

另一組作品《城市穿搭指南》則延續阮家儀的標誌性創作風格，在輸送帶上排列了各地名勝的紀念擺設，在光影投射下拼湊出一個世界地圖的縮影。

展覽由康樂及文化事務署主辦、香港視覺藝術中心籌劃。展覽於九月十日至明年二月九日在中區堅尼地道7A香港視覺藝術中心舉行，免費入場。有關展覽詳情，可瀏覽網頁www.apo.hk/tc/web/apo/va_mirage.html，或致電2521 3008查詢。"
Hong Kong Visual Arts Centre showcases large-scale lighting installations by artist Angela Yuen (with photos),2025-09-10 19:05,2025-09-10 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025090900666.htm,"  The Hong Kong Visual Arts Centre of the Art Promotion Office is staging the new exhibition ""Mirage"" from today (September 10), featuring two sets of new large-scale site-specific art installation works created by Hong Kong artist Angela Yuen.

Yuen has a unique emotional connection and artistic perspective on Hong Kong's urban culture. She utilises collected nostalgic found objects to create artworks. With the support of light projection techniques, her works evoke collective memories in the audience and prompt viewers to reflect on the evolving pace of urban society.

The two sets of installation works are on display in the public areas from the third to the fifth floor of the centre. The work ""Mirage"" is inspired by the musical fountains that were popular in mall public spaces during the 1990s. Yuen skilfully integrates dynamic light and shadow with ready-made objects that embody shared recollections, such as toys from children's meals from fast food restaurants and the crab-claw machines from indoor playgrounds, to create captivating sculptures. Through the rhythmic interplay of light and movement, the work prompts viewers to evoke memories of malls as public spaces and invites deeper reflection on consumer culture and childhood memories.

  Another artwork, ""City Styling Manual"", on display continues Yuen's signature creative approach.Souvenirs depicting iconic landmarks from around the world are arranged on a conveyor belt, interplaying with light and shadow to create a miniature world map.

The exhibition is presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and is organised by the Hong Kong Visual Arts Centre. The exhibition will run from September 10 to February 9 next year at the centre (7A Kennedy Road, Central). Admission is free.

立法會：政制及內地事務局局長動議恢復二讀辯論《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》發言全文（只有中文）,2025-09-10 18:54,2025-09-10 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000736.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上動議恢復二讀辯論《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》（《條例草案》）的發言全文：

代主席：

首先，我衷心感謝《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》法案委員會主席陳勇議員，以及各位委員、秘書處以及法律顧問所作的努力，令《條例草案》的審議工作得以順利高效完成。

我亦感謝立法會以及不同團體和社會人士透過不同渠道就《條例草案》向我們表達各種寶貴意見。特區政府對這些意見十分重視，並會在我們制訂相關安排時予以適當考慮。

正如政府一再強調，今次推出《條例草案》的目的，是履行終審法院在岑子杰對律政司司長案中宣告政府根據《香港人權法案》第十四條須履行的積極義務，即透過立法機制替代框架，讓同性伴侶關係獲得法律承認，並制訂伴隨的適當權利和責任。

而在整個推動立法的過程中，政府一直秉持着尊重法治、尊重終審法院裁決的精神，致力認真研究判詞的內容以及如何達致法院的裁決要求，並充分考慮香港的實際情況、傳統價值觀以及社會和諧穩定因素，從而作出適當平衡，形成社會「最大公約數」，以確保在適當維護同性伴侶人士權益的同時，亦符合香港的整體利益。而在推進有關法案時，政府亦不遺餘力地向立法會及公眾作出清晰詳細解說和游說，盡最大努力希望法案獲得立法會支持通過。這是政府對法院裁決的負責任行為，亦是積極維護社會整體利益和和諧穩定的務實做法。

而在立法會方面，我們亦樂見從法案推出以來，議員們都盡責履職地認真就法案進行審議並提出不同意見。作為社會民意代表的代議士，當遇上這類富爭議性而社會上又確實存在不同聲音和意見的議題，議員們有不同看法和意見實屬正常。關鍵是大家都能夠明白到這是終審法院的最終裁決而又為社會所高度關注，因此都格外審慎進行審議和提出意見，同時亦不斷收集聽取市民的各種不同意見，實事求是地在議會上作出反映。這本身亦是對法治以至法院裁決的尊重表現，亦充分反映在現行特區政治架構中，行政、立法、司法機關各司其職、相互尊重，有效發揮着各自的職能和責任，共同維護促進特區的穩定和諧發展。

在法案審議過程中，議員都提出不少務實的意見和建議，當中包括有議員擔心法案一旦獲得通過，會對傳統婚姻制度造成嚴重衝擊。政府亦一再鄭重強調，必定會堅決維護本港「一夫一妻、一男一女」的傳統婚姻制度。在岑子杰案中，終審法院的判詞亦明確確認，香港居民根據《基本法》及《香港人權法案》所保證和保障的婚姻憲法自由只限於異性婚姻，並把同性婚姻排除在外。這是香港社會傳承已久的核心家庭價值觀念，亦是構成社會穩定的重要基石，政府對此立場堅定，而建議的同性伴侶登記制度絕對不等同承認有關關係在香港擁有與婚姻相同的法律地位。

另外，亦有意見認為政府要求同性伴侶須在外地註冊後才可在本港進行登記，會為有關人士帶來不便和不公。這點我們在法案委員會會議上已作出多次詳細解說。制訂這項要求的主要原因，是政府在登記時須確認有關關係為已作出承諾及穩定的關係，而建議的做法可提供客觀的準則和清晰的驗證，在行政執行上較為可行；而對登記人而言，亦可減少在核實過程中可能帶來的不便。因此，我們認為有關做法是合適的，亦不會對登記人造成太大困難。

此外，亦有意見認為，政府給予同性伴侶的權利不足，甚至有違終審法院的裁決。我們亦多次強調，法院的要求是我們須履行積極義務，讓同性伴侶受到法律保障，免其私生活受到侵擾。而我們目前的方案，一方面設立法律承認機制，讓同性伴侶在透露其同性關係時免卻其私人生活受到干擾，同時亦給予核心權利，讓同性伴侶可滿足「基本的社會需求」。這已經是符合法庭的要求，至於具體權利的制訂，法院已明確表明行政及立法機關是有彈性的酌情空間，而我們按照香港的實際情況和整體利益作出考量和制訂，是絕對合理和合法的。

至於在《條例草案》審議過程中議員和各界所提出的其他意見，我們在法案委員會上已作出詳細回應，在此就不再費時重複了。

主席，政府深切明白同性伴侶獲法律承認和保障在社會上是具敏感和爭議性的議題。但在終審法院已作出最終裁決的前提下，政府亦遇事不避難，堅決承擔責任，履行法院判定的積極義務。惟在制訂方案和草擬法案過程中，我們亦充分考量了香港的實際情況和各相關因素，並致力取得平衡，一方面保障同性伴侶的合法權益，同時致力維持香港社會和諧穩定，並尊重傳統價值觀念。現法案已獲法案委員會審議，而各位議員亦在剛才的二讀辯論中發表了不同的意見，我懇請各位議員支持通過二讀《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》，以及我稍後動議的修正案。

我謹此陳辭。多謝代主席。"

​運輸及物流局局長出席香港商用航空中心新客運大樓啟用禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-09-10 18:52,2025-09-10 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000750.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（九月十日）出席香港商用航空中心新客運大樓啟用禮的致辭全文：

Raymond（新鴻基地產主席兼董事總經理郭炳聯）、Fred（香港機場管理局主席林天福）、Henry（全國政協常委及西九文化區管理局董事局主席唐英年）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友、各位傳媒：

大家好！今日我很高興並期待已久，因為早前Raymond已跟我預告HKBAC（香港商用航空中心）會有一個新猷，就是擴建大樓，今日終於等到。我剛才也跟Raymond主席說，他的眼光真是很好，時間剛好──現在香港經濟起飛、盛事活動做出很好的成績、世界上也有不同的商務和旅遊人士來香港，能夠目睹HKBAC新大樓竣工，我認為對於香港未來的經濟、旅遊和商業的發展有很大的幫助。

今日來到香港國際機場，一定要幫它再一次「賣告白」，多講也不怕。香港國際機場作為香港的金漆招牌，無可置疑。香港作為國際航空樞紐，無論客運、貨運的成績都一直在世界領先，若套用體育的術語，我們在全能、十項鐵人賽中成績彪炳。HKBAC在整個香港國際航空樞紐的發展裏，我會稱之為是一個最佳球員，Most Valuable Player，即MVP，當之無愧。HKBAC一直在香港國際機場裏打拼，吸引一些高端旅客。在我們整體的航空發展中，不單是客運、貨運，還有航班服務都一直提升。HKBAC連續18年獲商用航空雜誌《Professional Pilot》PRASE意見調查評為亞洲最佳公務機營運基地，是亞洲首屈一指的商務客機中心，值得我們引以為傲。

今日來到HKBAC擴建後的大樓，相信大家都很有印象，讓人感覺耳目一新。不單設計令人感到舒適，亦很實用。這標誌着HKBAC將來拓展更大業務的時候，是一個很重要的里程碑，亦給大家看到打了一支強心針。我期盼藉這個擴建計劃，能吸引更多國際商務客和旅客多來香港及選用HKBAC。

我知道在這個擴建的大樓裏可以享用一站式的服務，包括安檢、海關，還有一些辦公室，或接待傳媒的設施，有一條龍服務，客戶可因應個人需要而選取不同的服務。雖然聽聞收費不菲，但是價錢不是最重要，五星級的服務才是最重要。

說完硬件，軟件都很重要。除擴建大樓外，我知道HKBAC去年已率先提升服務。當客人坐私人飛機來到HKBAC，透過與香港機場管理局的協調和對接，可以轉乘民航客機，將轉機時間大大縮減了多達三分之一。這是相當重要的，因為作為商務客，他們對於私隱、方便會有要求，而時間亦是金錢。這個在軟件方面的提升，正正能幫助不少。

說到吸引旅客，大家可能都會感受得到，不單香港國際機場越來越繁忙，其實在市面上每周都有不同的項目。譬如今日的「一帶一路高峰論壇」，我從灣仔過來，那邊的交通都很繁忙，大家可以想像得到，香港國際機場要接待不同的國際旅客，同樣要用高效和方便的服務去吸引他們。接下來，特區政府銳意舉辦經濟相關的國際會議，以及盛事經濟等。剛才聊天的時候，我很高興得知HKBAC除了能吸引商務旅客，其實都接待了不少國際足球勁旅。在二○二五年上半年，商用航空中心處理超過30班商務航班，當中的商務客是來港處理上市事宜，成績令人鼓舞。

運動方面，香港的足球盛事一浪接一浪。足球勁旅訪港時都會選用HKBAC，配合其出行需要，並且接待傳媒或球迷。希望透過你們這個招牌，幫助我們的盛事經濟，吸引多些類似的體育活動明星來港。

航空方面，本月底會在香港舉辦一個世界航線發展大會2025，屆時將匯聚逾3 000名來自世界各地的航空業領袖及團隊。HKBAC將會發揮一個很重要的關鍵角色，亦可展示香港在這方面所提供的服務。除了這個HKBAC客運大樓，我相信slot（升降時刻）是很重要的。我聽到民航處處長說，正正因為現時三跑道系統已經落成，香港國際機場的整體運力提升了五成。我們暫時都應該還有slot，希望Vivien（香港商用航空中心行政總裁劉敏儀）你們着力吸引更多客人。民航航班數量都一直上升，所以HKBAC要盡快去爭取和不同地方的商務協作，希望可以盡量利用我們現在所增加的一些班次時刻。

今日在活動上見到Fred和Vivian（香港機場管理局行政總裁張李佳蕙），都想和大家宣傳一下機管局的SKYTOPIA，現時正默默招商引資。這個地標正正是一個香港做招商引資的縮影，SKYTOPIA當中的元素就如香港，匯集商務、經濟、文化、旅遊、餐飲、藝術、展覽場地和演唱會。其實在香港能想得到的活動，Fred和Vivian都想好了，最重要是要吸引客人，當中不少是高端客戶，希望這個計劃可以給予大家多一個契機，拓展HKBAC的業務。我們也很希望透過SKYTOPIA，吸引多些內地或國際的旅客來港，促進香港作為內地與國際一個「超級聯繫人」的角色。

最後我衷心期盼HKBAC今日這個里程碑可以幫助我們，帶領香港國際機場的業務蒸蒸日上，繼續把我們這個金漆招牌擦得更光、更亮。多謝大家。"
DH signs agreements with Beijing Municipal Health Commission and Disease Prevention and Control Administration to strengthen collaborative development of public health between Beijing and Hong Kong,2025-09-10 18:52,2025-09-10 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000692.htm,"âAt the invitation of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission (BJHC), the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, is leading a delegation from the Department of Health (DH) to Beijing to visit public health institutions and deepen collaboration. The delegation today (September 10) attended the launch and opening event of the 2025 China International Fair for Trade in Services Health and Wellness Service Innovations. During the visit, the DH signed two agreements, one with the BJHC and another with the Beijing Municipal Disease Prevention and Control Administration, solidifying the foundation for collaboration between Beijing and Hong Kong in safeguarding public health and advancing health initiatives.

​立法會主席就《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》會見傳媒的發言（只有中文）,2025-09-10 18:20,2025-09-10 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000726.htm,"下稿代立法會秘書處發出：

以下是立法會主席梁君彥議員今日（九月十日）於立法會綜合大樓會見傳媒的發言：

各位傳媒朋友，立法會剛剛審議了《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》（《條例草案》），法案未獲出席議員過半數贊成，未能通過二讀。就此，我想同大家分享幾點。

《條例草案》源於二○二三年九月五日終審法院在一案中裁定，根據《香港人權法案》第十四條所保障的私生活權利，政府有積極義務立法確立替代框架，讓同性伴侶關係獲得法律承認。政府向立法會提出《條例草案》。

立法會向來支持行政長官和特區政府施政。政府提出《條例草案》時，社會各界已有很多爭論。議員成立了法案委員會，與政府當局舉行了四次會議，認真討論了《條例草案》的政策理念，並細心逐條審議法案條文，正反意見互相交鋒，同時邀請公眾人士提出意見。法案委員會共收到超過一萬份公眾意見書，當中大概超過八成表示反對《條例草案》，而表示支持的意見書只有大約百分之十九。

根據《基本法》，立法會的職權包括制定、修改和廢除法律，以及監察政府工作。無論立法會通過或不通過政府的法案；議員對法案投贊成抑或反對票，只要權力行使得恰當，便符合憲制秩序。

在審議《條例草案》的整個過程中，立法會一直嚴謹、依法履行職責。在今日的會議上，經過大約四小時的充分辯論，議員各抒己見，立法會最終投票否決《條例草案》二讀。這完全符合《基本法》規定，不會影響香港特區憲制秩序。

事實上，《條例草案》涉及極具爭議性的道德議題。香港是一個很開放的社會，但同時仍然是恪守一男一女婚姻制度的社會。今日的投票結果，可說是實際反映了今日香港社會的主流民意和價值觀。

我要強調，立法會一如既往尊重法庭判決、堅守法治原則，但鑑於《條例草案》涉及重大道德議題，立法會議員必須兼顧香港社會的實際情況，包括傳統價值觀、社會整體利益、公眾意見和期望。議員綜合考慮各項因素後，憑良心投票。這正正體現了在行政主導下，行政、立法和司法機關各司其職、互相尊重、互相制衡，而大家都是本着同一理念、同一目標，就是為香港做事、為香港好。

今次《條例草案》雖然未獲通過，但我認為「立法」並不是唯一解決方法。香港是一個很包容的城市，一直都很尊重不同性取向人士的生活方式。立法會期望（與）政府及社會各界繼續坦誠交流，促進共識，為將來有序推動相關議題和解決方案創造更有利的條件。立法會亦會繼續依法支持行政長官和特區政府施政。"

立法會五題：為罕見病復發及惡化的患者提供治療,2025-09-10 17:58,2025-09-10 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000561.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上陳凱欣議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的答覆︰

問題：

據悉醫院管理局（下稱「醫管局」）正參考涵蓋207種罕見病的國家罕見病目錄，建立罕見病資料庫，以便識別有關患者和檢索應診紀錄。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，根據醫管局罕見病資料庫定義，過去五年每年公立醫院急症室的罕見病患者求診宗數；當中有多少宗屬病情復發或惡化個案，以及該等個案所涉及的患者人數和當中求診次數最多的五種罕見病為何；有否統計該等患者由抵達急症室至接受治療的最長和中位數時間為何；

（二）是否知悉，醫管局醫護人員如何利用罕見病資料庫，在臨床應用層面協助診治罕見病患者，尤其是該等因病情復發或惡化而於非預約時間求診的患者；及

（三）鑑於一些復發率高的罕見病（例如視神經脊髓炎），若無適時用藥會造成不可逆轉的損傷，政府是否知悉，醫管局會否就該等罕見病成立跨專科專家小組，定期檢討治療方案及急症室處理有關病人的流程，並制訂相關臨床指引和黃金治療時間，以加快對該等病人的診治？

答覆：

主席：

就陳凱欣議員的提問，經諮詢醫管局（醫院管理局）後，現綜合回覆如下：

醫管局很重視為所有病人（包括罕見病患者）提供適切的治療。

國際間對於罕見疾病並沒有一致的定義。為強化對罕見病患者的臨床支援及提升診斷治療的能力，醫管局參考涵蓋207種罕見病的國家罕見病目錄，建立罕見病資料庫。醫管局臨床醫療管理系統備存所有病人（包括罕見病患者）的臨床數據和不同疾病類別的資料，醫生會在為目錄內涵蓋的罕見病患者提供治療時，於臨床醫療管理系統的應診紀錄中輸入相關診斷編碼，以識別罕見病患者，並相應提供適切治療。隨着醫管局累積更多治療罕見病的本地經驗及臨床數據，臨床醫療管理系統內罕見病患者的資料庫將得以擴充，為醫療服務規劃和臨床診斷治療提供很重要的參考。截至今年六月三十日，醫管局臨床醫療管理系統已全數收錄了國家罕見病目錄中所涵蓋的207種罕見病，總個案數目約為63 600宗。

根據醫管局的統計數字，全港一些較不罕見的五類罕見病患者依次為：胃腸間質瘤、全身型重症肌無力、早產兒視網膜病、遺傳性低鎂血症及真性紅血球增多症。當中大部分罕見病患者確診後都可在門診跟進，只有少數患者需要入院接受治療。病人若因病情需要前往急症室求診，醫護人員會根據其臨床情況提供適切的治療。

應對罕見病方面的主要挑戰在於病例很少，令診斷和治療比較困難。罕見病的症狀很多時候並不典型及缺乏一些特定性，亦往往與常見不適很相似，同時有機會影響多個器官系統，導致患者在不同的專科診室之間求診，未能全面了解疾病的狀況。除臨床檢查外，確診亦可能需要一些高技術的測試，例如基因檢測，延長診斷過程。

針對遺傳性罕見病，例如成骨不全症及性聯遺傳型低磷酸鹽症，配合基因組醫學在香港的最新發展，醫管局的醫學遺傳服務為遺傳病（包括罕見病）患者及其家庭提供一站式的跨專業支援。患有或懷疑受各種遺傳病及其他罕見病影響的病人及其家庭會獲轉介至香港兒童醫院醫學遺傳科，接受評估、檢驗、診斷、治療、輔導，以及預防的一站式服務。本着「全人醫治」的宗旨，醫管局透過跨專業及跨部門團隊，包括醫生、護士、藥劑師、臨床心理學家、康復專科護士、物理治療師、營養師、職業治療師、語言治療師、義肢矯形師和醫務社工等，以綜合服務模式為罕見病患者提供全人醫療和復康服務。

此外，香港基因組中心自二○二一年開始展開香港基因組計劃，在公立醫院招募合資格病人及其家屬自願參與全基因組測序，涵蓋個別與基因組學及精準醫學有關的罕見病，如黏多醣症、馬凡氏綜合症等。測序結果有助精準診斷，並為預後評估及治療決策提供關鍵依據。政府未來會繼續推進落實二○二四年《施政報告》中的措施，發展精準醫療。

就題述的視神經脊髓炎（Neuromyelitis Optica），該疾病是一種極為罕見的自身免疫疾病。患者的免疫系統會攻擊自己的視神經和脊髓，造成視神經炎和脊髓炎的損傷，因此，患者一般由眼科醫生或腦神經科醫生診治，並視乎需要作出會診，及安排有關檢查。

有關病人如因病情復發，出現病徵，而須到急症室求診，會於現行的急症室分流制度下由分流護士進行評估及分流，並且根據病情的嚴重程度，決定治理的先後次序。醫管局的服務目標訂明，所有危殆的病人（即一類）會即時得到診治，即百分之一百獲即時診治。而危急及緊急，即二類和三類的病人，在抵達急症室後亦會得到優先治理，目標是絕大部分的危急病人和緊急病人分別會在15分鐘或30分鐘內獲處理。一般而言，病人若出現急性視力下降或局部神經障礙的症狀，將被分流為緊急，即是三類類別。急症室的目標是安排緊急類別的病人於30分鐘內接受診治。如病人有臨床需要，急症室會安排眼科跟進，由眼科專科醫生即時評估情況，作出臨床檢查、抽血，以及電腦掃描等檢查，以排除其他有可能導致相關病徵的情況。病人經評估後，會按病情需要，作住院或轉介到相關專科門診治療及跟進。多謝主席。"
LCQ5: Providing treatment for patients experiencing relapses or deterioration of rare diseases,2025-09-10 17:58,2025-09-10 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000562.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hoi-yan and a reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  It is learnt that the Hospital Authority (HA) is developing the Rare Diseases Database by referencing the Mainland's National Lists of Rare Diseases which contains 207 rare disease entries, with a view to facilitating the identification of the relevant patients and retrieval of their clinical records. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows, according to the definitions under HA's Rare Diseases Database, the number of cases in which rare disease patients attend the accident and emergency (A&E) departments of public hospitals for treatment in each of the past five years, and among those cases, the number involving relapses or deterioration of the diseases and the number of patients concerned, as well as the top five rare diseases with the highest number of attendances; whether it has compiled statistics on the longest and median time taken from patients arriving at the A&E departments to receiving treatment;

(2) whether it knows how HA's healthcare staff make use of the Rare Diseases Database to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of rare disease patients in terms of clinical applications, in particular those patients seeking treatment without scheduled appointments due to relapses or deterioration of the diseases; and

(3) given that irreversible damage could be caused to patients suffering from certain rare diseases with high relapse rates (such as neuromyelitis optica) if timely medical treatment is not administered, whether the Government knows if HA will set up a multi-specialty expert panel in respect of such rare diseases to regularly review treatment protocols and the procedures for handling the patients concerned by the A&E departments, as well as to formulate the relevant clinical guidelines and define the golden hours for treatment so as to expedite diagnosis and treatment for such patients?

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Hospital Authority (HA), the consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Hoi-yan is as follows:

  The HA attaches high importance to providing optimal care for all patients, including those with rare diseases.

  There is no common definition of rare diseases worldwide. To enhance clinical support for patients with rare diseases and improve diagnostic and treatment capabilities, the HA has developed the Rare Diseases Database by referencing the National Lists of Rare Diseases which contains 207 rare disease entities. The HA's Clinical Management System (CMS) maintains clinical data for all patients, including those with rare diseases, alongside information on various disease categories. When providing treatment for patients with rare diseases covered under the lists, doctors will input the relevant diagnosis codes in the consultation records in the HA's CMS to identify patients with rare diseases and provide appropriate care accordingly. As the HA accumulates more local experience in treating rare diseases and clinical data, the database of rare disease patients in the CMS will become more extensive, providing important reference for healthcare service planning as well as clinical diagnosis and treatment. As at June 30 this year, the HA's CMS has recorded all 207 diseases listed in the National Lists of Rare Diseases, with a total of about 63 600 cases.

  According to statistics from the HA, the five types of rare diseases that are relatively less uncommon in Hong Kong are, in order of prevalence: gastrointestinal stromal tumor, generalised myasthenia gravis, retinopathy of prematurity, hereditary hypomagnesemia, and polycythemia vera. After diagnosis, most of these rare disease patients can be managed through out-patient follow-ups, with only a small number requiring hospitalisation for treatment. Where patients are required to attend the accident and emergency (A&E) department due to medical needs, healthcare staff will provide appropriate treatment based on their clinical conditions.

  The primary challenge in dealing with rare diseases lies in the small number of cases, resulting in difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. Symptoms of rare diseases are often atypical and non-specific, frequently resembling common ailments. Additionally, these symptoms may affect multiple organ systems, leading patients to consult various medical specialties without obtaining a comprehensive understanding of their condition. Apart from clinical examinations, diagnosis may also require some high technology testings, such as genetic testings, thereby prolonging the diagnostic process.

  For hereditary rare diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta and X-linked hypophosphataemia, the clinical genetics service of the HA provides one-stop cross-disciplinary support for patients with genetic disorders (including rare diseases) and their families, in line with the latest developments in genomic medicine in Hong Kong. Patients who are affected or suspected to be affected by various genetic diseases and other rare diseases as well as their families will be referred to the Department of Clinical Genetics of Hong Kong Children's Hospital for one-stop services, including assessment, testing, diagnosis, treatment, counselling and prevention services. Adhering to the principle of ""providing holistic care for patients"", the HA adopts an integrated service model in providing holistic medical and rehabilitation services to patients with rare diseases through multi-disciplinary and inter-departmental teams, comprising doctors, nurses, pharmacists, clinical psychologists, rehabilitation specialty nurses, physiotherapists, dietitians, occupational therapists, speech therapists, prosthetist-orthotists, medical social workers, etc.

  In addition, the Hong Kong Genome Institute launched the Hong Kong Genome Project since 2021, covering rare diseases associated with genomics and precision medicine, such as mucopolysaccharidosis and Marfan syndrome. Eligible patients and their family members are recruited through public hospitals to undergo whole genome sequencing on a voluntary basis. The sequencing results assist precise diagnoses and provide key basis for prognosis assessment and treatment decisions. The Government will continue to advance the implementation of the initiative under the 2024 Policy Address in developing precision medicine.

  Regarding Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) as mentioned in the question, it is an extremely rare autoimmune disorder in which the immune system of the patient attacks his/her own optic nerves and spinal cord, causing damages to optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. As a result, patients are typically managed by ophthalmologists or neurologists. Joint consultations will be arranged as needed, along with relevant investigations.

  In cases where these patients need to attend the A&E department due to relapses and presentation of symptoms, they will undergo assessment and triage by nurses under the prevailing triage system at the A&E department. The treatment priority is determined based on the severity of their condition. The HA's service targets stipulate that all critical patients (Triage 1) are to receive immediate treatment (i.e. 100 per cent immediate treatment), while emergency (Triage 2) patients and urgent (Triage 3) patients will be prioritised for treatment upon arrival at the A&E department, the targets being that most of the emergency and urgent patients are to be treated within 15 minutes and 30 minutes respectively. Generally speaking, patients experiencing symptoms such as acute vision loss or focal neurological deficits will be triaged as urgent cases (i.e. Triage 3). The A&E department aims to arrange these urgent patients for treatment within 30 minutes. In case the patient concerned has clinical needs, the A&E department will refer him/her to the Department of Ophthalmology for follow-up. The ophthalmology specialist will forthwith assess the condition of the patient and conduct clinical examinations, blood tests and computerised tomography (CT) scans etc, to rule out other conditions that may cause the relevant symptoms. After assessment, patients may be arranged for hospitalisation or referred to the relevant specialist out-patient clinics for treatment and follow-up subject to their conditions. Thank you, President."
SFST's keynote speech at Forum on Sustainability Disclosures (English only) (with photos),2025-09-10 17:42,2025-09-10 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000625.htm,"  Following is the keynote speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the Forum on Sustainability Disclosures today (September 10):

Kelvin (Chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Dr Kelvin Wong), Julia (Chief Executive Officer of the Securities and Futures Commission, Ms Julia Leung), Emmanuel (Chief Executive Officer of the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial Services Regulatory Authority, Mr Emmanuel Givanakis), Mark (Chief Executive of the Dubai Financial Services Authority, Mr Mark Steward), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. It is my pleasure to join you all at the Forum on Sustainability Disclosures today to exchange views on this topic with growing importance globally. First of all, I would like to thank the Securities and Futures Commission, our co-organiser of today's event, and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), our event partner, for joining hands with our bureau (Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau) to promote the development of a comprehensive sustainability disclosure ecosystem in Hong Kong. Today's Forum is one of the fruits of our joint effort, providing a platform for vibrant exchanges of expertise, ideas and global collaboration to foster sustainability disclosures in the global capital market. Also, amid the current complicated geopolitical environment, we are also here to reaffirm our commitment in driving the sustainability agenda together with our partners.

  Having accurate, comparable and consistent information on sustainability-related topics, as highlighted by Kelvin just now, is vital for making informed decisions, evaluating climate-related risks, and fostering innovation in sustainable financing. This is why sustainability disclosures are attracting fast-growing global awareness. Today we will explore together the path ahead for the global and local adoption of the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) - Sustainability Disclosure Standards (ISSB Standards). We will also discuss how disclosures can drive significant progress in sustainability development and facilitating financing and investments for real economy transition, climate adaption and mitigation in Hong Kong, the region, and beyond.

  Hong Kong is a leading international financial centre and a hub for green and sustainable finance. Last year, the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong amounted to around US$43 billion, capturing around 45 per cent of the regional total and ranking first in the Asian market for seven consecutive years since 2018. Besides, as of June 2025, the number of environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds authorised by the SFC was over 200 with assets under management reaching HK$1.1 trillion and more. The number of ESG funds and assets under management recorded an increase of 51 per cent and 18 per cent respectively from three years ago. At the same time, we are committed to enhancing our competitiveness by adhering to the international standards and best practices, and have taken big steps in achieving this goal.

Sustainability disclosures

  Following the release of the first set of the ISSB Standards back in 2023, the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government published a vision statement in March last year, outlining our vision and approach in building a comprehensive ecosystem for sustainability disclosure in Hong Kong. Since then, listed companies, financial institutions, investors and industry organisations have been engaged in the consultation to identify Hong Kong-specific circumstances that should be taken into account when developing the Hong Kong Sustainability Disclosure Standards (Hong Kong Standards) which is in full alignment with the ISSB Standards. We are happy that the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), as the sustainability reporting standard setter in Hong Kong, published last December the Hong Kong Standards, which are fully aligned with the ISSB Standards.

  After the release of our vision statement, we continued to work closely with financial regulators and stakeholders in ironing out the steps and timeline for Hong Kong's full adoption of the ISSB Standards. We launched in December last year the Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in Hong Kong, detailing the approach to require publicly accountable entities (PAEs) to adopt the ISSB Standards. This roadmap provides a clear pathway for large PAEs to adopt fully the ISSB Standards no later than 2028.

  Since the launch of the Roadmap, we have made progressive moves towards our target. For listed issuers, the HKEX has implemented in phases since January this year new climate-related disclosures requirements under its Listing Rules (New Climate Requirements), which are developed based on IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures. The New Climate Requirements aim to prepare companies to start climate reporting early in accordance with provisions of the ISSB Standards. The HKEX will consult the market in 2027 on mandating sustainability reporting against the Hong Kong Standards for listed PAEs, with an expected effective date of January 2028 under a proportionate approach. For the financial industry, our financial regulators will conduct sector-specific engagements to determine the approach and timing of adopting the Hong Kong Standards for different financial sectors. Subject to stakeholders' comments and feedback, relevant financial regulators will require non-listed financial institutions carrying a significant weight (i.e. non-listed PAEs) to apply the Hong Kong Standards no later than 2028.

  We are proud that the IFRS Foundation, in its publication of the jurisdictional profiles on adoption of the ISSB Standards this June, confirms Hong Kong as among the initial set of jurisdictions having set a target of fully adopting the ISSB Standards. This underscores our commitment to enhancing the transparency of information on sustainable development in the capital markets, enabling investors to make informed investment decisions and promoting global capital flows.

  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the ISSB for its support and continuous engagements with relevant stakeholders in Hong Kong during our journey on the full adoption of ISSB Standards.

Sustainability assurance

  To support smooth and practical implementation of sustainability disclosure requirements, a comprehensive and robust ecosystem encompassing aspects such as sustainability assurance, data and technology, as well as skills and competencies is vital. For sustainability assurance, the HKICPA issued in March this year the Hong Kong Standard on Sustainability Assurance 5000 which fully converges with the International Standard on Sustainability Assurance 5000 published by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. It will develop the local ethics standards for sustainability assurance, which will be on a full convergence basis with the International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance published by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, for publication within this year. The Accounting and Financial Reporting Council is also working with relevant financial regulators and stakeholders with a view to releasing a proposed local regulatory framework for sustainability assurance for public consultation within this year.

Data and technology

  Promoting data and technology is one of our key priorities to promote the availability and accessibility of sustainability-related information. We have launched a number of tools to support enterprises, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in sustainability reporting. For example, a Climate and Environmental Risk Questionnaire for non-listed companies/SMEs was launched three years ago to provide a free and easy-to-use sustainability reporting template to corporates in need, facilitating their understanding of their sustainability performance and raising their sustainability profiles to lenders, investors and supply chain clients. We are now enhancing the Questionnaire to make it more accessible and inclusive.

  Another example is the greenhouse gas emissions calculation and estimation tools we launched in February last year. The tools are free for public use and aim to help corporations manage their environmental footprint while encouraging market participants to improve their sustainable development practices. The tools also clearly disclose the methodology and data sources, and incorporate Hong Kong and Mainland elements into the calculation and estimation models. Going forward, we will continue to enhance the tools and collaborate with different stakeholders to facilitating better sustainability disclosures with the use of these tools.

Skills and competencies

  Last but not least, we are committed to strengthening capacity building to assist the industry and companies in their journey towards sustainability disclosures. The HKSAR Government will continue to support industry capacity building through our Pilot Green and Sustainable Finance Capacity Building Support Scheme launched three years ago, and the Scheme will be extended to 2028. Besides, financial regulators, the HKEX and the HKICPA, have been organising conferences, seminars and other stakeholder exchange activities to promote alignment with the ISSB Standards and support capacity building efforts locally, regionally and internationally. These engagement activities and relevant training programmes help to nurture skilled sustainable finance professionals including preparers, reporting and assurance professionals, and sustainability-related service providers.

  By collaborating and working together, we can definitely build a sustainable and resilient future. Before I wish all of you a fruitful day, normally these days, forums can't finish without mentioning AI. Just before I came to this stage, I checked on my app in terms of what word it would use to describe Hong Kong and also sustainability disclosure. There are a number of choices, of course it depends on which app you use and also what time of the day that you use it. One of the key words is actually ""ecosystem"".

  I think the app describes what I just described, basically it's about who to provide, what to provide and how to provide the information. I'm sure in the coming days and also this forum, you will be having a lot of insightful discussions and exchanges, in particular how Hong Kong can be a better ecosystem on sustainability disclosures for not just Hong Kong but also for the region and the world. Thank you."
醫務衞生局局長會見傳媒談流感疫苗（只有中文）,2025-09-10 17:34,2025-09-10 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000644.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（九月十日）出席立法會會議後會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：（有關政府採購流感疫苗時的考慮）另外，政府有「先入先出」原則，但對於一些學校學生來說，家長不能選擇疫苗的品牌，會否擔心家長會選擇到私營機構打針，或者索性不安排小朋友打針，會否擔心令流感爆發﹖

醫務衞生局局長：滅活疫苗在全球已使用超過50年，是一個非常成熟的疫苗技術。在新冠疫情期間，我們都知道滅活疫苗，特別是科興疫苗，在香港廣泛應用達900萬劑，足以證明其質量安全和效力，這對抗疫非常重要。我們在考慮疫苗的註冊時，一貫採用非常高的標準，根據其質量安全，以及效能，並根據藥廠提供的數據作註冊，所以所有符合審批註冊標準的，我們都會列入考慮方案中。關於疫苗採購，我們一直都堅持多元化，因為疫苗的供應，特別是季節性流感，其供應會受到許多因素影響。我們為了要確保這些疫苗的供應不會受到某些因素影響，必須多元化，從不同的途徑去採購疫苗，整個過程都是根據最高標準。

科興疫苗方面，它確實是沒有一些有關孕婦應用的臨床研究數據，但是不表示孕婦不適合用，科興疫苗沒有對孕婦列為禁忌症，故此，是可以使用的。不過，因為它沒有針對孕婦而做的臨床數據，雖然滅活疫苗本身對孕婦是安全的，對嬰兒亦沒有影響，但在藥廠提供的指引中，就列出應與醫生商量以作判斷和風險評估後才採用。

至於本港，每年流感疫苗，例如上年接種超過200萬劑。孕婦方面，我們計算大概每年有6 000名孕婦接種流感疫苗，佔總數量比較少。如果孕婦與醫生評估後，決定不用科興疫苗，她亦可以選擇其他的一些選擇。我們採購的賽諾菲三價滅活疫苗，都是滅活疫苗，不過是三價，有孕婦使用的臨床數據，所以她們可以使用的。賽諾菲三價滅活疫苗我們購買超過90萬劑，對於那幾千名孕婦的需求，是絕對沒有問題的。

至於在學校的疫苗接種方面，我一定要強調，所有我們現在採購的兩種滅活疫苗，都是安全的，亦是適合給所有的市民使用，包括兒童。在對抗流感方面，大家都很清晰，最近很不幸有幾宗嚴重個案，我們對抗流感必須做好準備工作，而流感疫苗接種是最重要的一環。我在此重申，兒童、他們的家長，最重要是要接種流感疫苗。學校外展計劃可以提供噴鼻式疫苗，也可以混合，某些同學希望用噴鼻式，亦有一些用注射的滅活疫苗，都可以給他們一個選擇。如果有些非常少數的學校不參與外展，家長亦可以選擇到私營醫療診所接受接種。"

李家超歡迎孫占托率團來港，出席第十屆「一帶一路高峰論壇」和擔任演講嘉賓。李家超說，特區政府積極開拓東南亞國家聯盟和「一帶一路」國家等新興市場；柬埔寨市場發展迅速、經濟潛力龐大，兩地合作空間廣闊。香港與柬埔寨去年共達成13份合作備忘錄，涵蓋經貿、航空和金融服務等範疇，他很高興今日論壇上見證雙方政府部門達成更多合作備忘錄，進一步加強雙方交流合作。

李家超表示，柬埔寨是國家推動「一帶一路」的戰略夥伴；香港擁有高度國際化、市場化和便利的營商環境，具有資金、技術和市場資源的優勢，會充分發揮「一帶一路」功能平台角色，與柬埔寨共同抓緊「一帶一路」機遇，促進兩地經貿發展，互惠共贏。他歡迎柬埔寨企業善用香港的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，開拓海外和內地市場。

李家超感謝柬埔寨支持建立國際調解院。他表示，國際調解院總部設於香港，展現香港在國際調解方面的獨特優勢和實力，進一步促進香港的國際交往合作。香港會繼續發揮背靠祖國、聯通世界的優勢，為推動共建「一帶一路」貢獻力量。"
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-09-10 17:30,2025-09-10 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000620.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（九月十日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱的輸入個案。

最新個案資料

新增個案涉及一名居於深水埗區的五歲男童，他於七月十五日至八月三十一日與家人到訪廣東省鶴山市和鄰近的佛山市。病人於九月五日出現發燒、九月七日出現皮疹，翌日到明愛醫院急症室求診，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。他的三名家居接觸者（包括兩名一同到鶴山市的人士）現時沒有出現病徵，並正接受醫學監察。

由於病人於潛伏期身處鶴山市，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得14宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案（八宗來自廣東省、四宗孟加拉國、一宗印度尼西亞及一宗斯里蘭卡）。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月三十一日至九月六日）廣東省新增178宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較過去兩周分別225宗（八月二十四日至三十日）及336宗（八月十七日至二十三日）進一步減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然廣東省的情況在八月下旬起已受到控制，每日只有零星新增個案，但現時全球多國仍爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-10 17:30,2025-09-10 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000616.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 10), onenew imported case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

 The new case involves a five-year-old boy living in Sham Shui Po District. He visited Heshan City and the neighboring Foshan City in Guangdong Province with his family between July 15 and August 31. The patient developed a fever on September 5 and a rash on September 7. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Caritas Medical Centre the next day and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. He is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing. His three household contacts, including two persons who travelled to Heshan with the boy,are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since the patient stayed in Heshan during the incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 14 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases (eight from Guangdong Province, four from Bangladesh, one from Indonesia and one from Sri Lanka). From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 178 new CF cases in Guangdong during the past week (August 31 to September 6), showing a further decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 225 cases (August 24 to 30) and 336 cases (August 17 to 23) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the situation in Guangdong Province has been under control since late August, with only sporadic new cases reported each day, CF outbreaks continue in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

â
The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Also attending the meeting was the Deputy Financial Secretary, Mr Michael Wong.

ããMr Lee welcomed Mr Sun and his delegation to Hong Kong to attend the 10th Belt and Road Summit and to serve as a keynote speaker. Noting that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is actively exploring emerging markets in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Belt and Road countries, Mr Lee said that Cambodia, with its rapid market development and vast economic potential, offers broad opportunities for co-operation between the two places. Hong Kong and Cambodia reached 13 Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) last year, covering areas such as economics and trade, aviation, and financial services. Mr Lee said he was pleased to witness more MOUs between government departments of the two places at today's Summit, which will further enhance bilateral exchanges and co-operation.

ããMr Lee said that Cambodia is a strategic partner in the country's promotion of the Belt and Road Initiative, while Hong Kong possesses a highly internationalised, market-oriented and business-friendly environment with strengths in capital, technology and market resources that enable it to fully serve as a functional platform to help both places seize the opportunities from the Belt and Road Initiative, fostering economic and trade development and achieving mutual benefits and win-win outcomes. He welcomed enterprises from Cambodia to leverage Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" to explore overseas and Mainland markets.

ããMr Lee thanked Cambodia for its support in establishing the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed). He said that the establishment of the IOMed headquarters in Hong Kong demonstrates the city's unique advantages and strengths in international mediation to further promote international exchanges and co-operation. Hong Kong will continue to leverage its advantages of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world, thereby contributing to the promotion of the development of the Belt and Road Initiative."
立法會：運輸及物流局局長動議二讀《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》發言全文（只有中文）,2025-09-10 17:28,2025-09-10 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000639.htm,"​以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上動議二讀《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》的發言全文：

主席：

我謹動議二讀《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》（《條例草案》）。

隨着科技進步和出行模式改變，透過網絡預約個人化點對點交通服務在世界各地已相當普及，香港作為一個國際大都會，情況亦不例外。今屆特區政府抱着破局的決心，引入清晰的法律框架規管網約車服務解決這個多年的爭議。政府提出的規管框架，將市民利益放在首位，目標是讓市民有更多安全、合法合規和多元化的出行選擇。同時，我們亦會兼顧司機的生意，吸引新血入行，促進點對點行業的健康和有序發展，希望為行業帶來全新景象。

網約車的議題複雜，牽涉多方面的因素和不同持份者，各界就着規管細節意見紛陳。不過，不論是市民、的士業界，還是網約車平台公司，他們都有一個非常清晰明確的共識，就是政府應該早日規管網約車服務，一方面保障乘客安全，滿足市民的出行需要，另一方面也為整體個人化點對點交通服務締造一個良性的競爭環境。

我們就有關議題在今年七月諮詢立法會交通事務委員會時，議員一致支持政府就提供網約車服務的平台、車輛及司機作出規管，亦同時支持政府全速推進立法工作，以期能夠讓規管制度早日「落地」，回應社會各界的訴求。在此，我衷心感謝各個議員的支持，以及他們就規管框架所提出的寶貴意見。

在過去一段時間，我們一直密鑼緊鼓籌劃規管框架和草擬有關法律條文，並繼續虛心聆聽各界意見，理性務實調整立法建議，希望有關規管框架在保障市民出行安全的同時，亦能鼓勵行業發展。今日，我向立法會提交《條例草案》，踏出立法方案的第一步，透過修訂《道路交通條例》，先就規管框架確立原則性的事宜，並為下一階段的工作提供法律基礎。我們會在下一屆立法會會期開展後，透過附屬法例進一步訂定規管的技術細節。視乎立法和其他準備工作的進度，我期望首批持牌的網約車平台可於二○二六年第四季內開始營運。

為了保障乘客的出行安全和權益，我們在《條例草案》中要求提供網約車服務的平台、私家車和司機三方都需要領有合適的牌證。日後，合法的網約車服務必須符合三大條件，包括（1）通過持牌平台預約和安排；（2）提供服務的私家車領有網約車車輛許可證；以及（3）駕駛有關車輛的司機領有網約車車輛駕駛許可證。違反上述條件提供網約車服務屬於非法載客取酬，須負上刑責。

在建議的規管框架下，任何提供網約車平台服務的電子或電訊平台都需要領取網約車服務牌照。持牌平台必須為在香港註冊的公司，並符合指定的入場門檻，包括在營運經驗、財力證明、資本投入、董事資格等各方面，以確保持牌平台具備足夠的營運能力提供優質的網約車服務。

持牌平台須維持適當且具效率的服務，並對旗下車輛和司機進行盡職審查，確保他們領有合適的許可證。此外，平台亦須並備存妥善的營運紀錄並向運輸署署長提交。運輸署會監察平台的營運，並就牌照施加條件。如果日後平台違反牌照條件或法定要求，視乎嚴重程度，運輸署署長可以施加罰款，更改或暫時吊銷牌照，甚至取消牌照。

提供網約車服務的私家車必須持有車輛許可證，並購買合適的第三者風險保險；在申請或每年續領許可證時，車齡須低於12年並符合有關驗車的要求。此外，車輛須由個人名義登記並只能由登記車主提供服務，在營運時亦須按規定展示標識以供識別。「人車綁定」的安排有助吸引真正有意提供有質素網約車服務的人士加入行業，亦避免衍生網約車租賃市場，令車輛許可證淪為具炒賣價值的資產或出現黑工司機的情況。

至於司機方面，司機須領有網約車車輛駕駛許可證才可提供網約車服務，並須符合指定的條件，包括年滿21歲、持有香港永久性居民身份證、五年內沒有嚴重交通定罪紀錄，並完成指定考核等。

我們建議將來申請的士及網約車駕駛資格的人士可參與同一個簡化的筆試，而已持有的士駕駛執照的人士，可無須再次考試便可向運輸署申請駕駛許可證。當然日後考的士執照的人士，參與筆試後，他們亦可以申請駕駛網約車，並領取網約車司機許可證。有關措施可有助改善司機短缺以及老化的情況，壯大香港現時的司機供應、吸引新血入行，最重要是推動整個點對點行業的持續發展。

上述各項的牌證要求既可保障乘客安全和利益，亦有助提升和締造良性競爭的環境，讓的士和網約車發揮各自的優勢，為市民提供優質服務。的士與網約車絕對不是零和博弈，而是共存互補。在引入規範化的網約車後，的士獨特和固有的優勢，包括他們可以在街上截乘乘客、可使用遍布全港各區的的士站、禁區上落客等，這些一一的優勢以及獨特性將維持不變；而網約車亦可透過共享經濟的模式釋放閒置運力，為市民提供更多元化的選擇。我們相信透過引入規管制度，可達致的士、網約車、市民多方共贏。

在考慮車輛許可證的數目時，我們必須顧及香港獨特的實際情況。香港城市發展密度高，每日有接近九成市民使用高效的公交系統出行，如果無限制地發出車輛許可證很可能會引發負面效果，例如交通擠塞，影響公交系統生態；或導致市場惡性競爭，令整體司機生意和行業發展受到影響。因此，政府有需要對網約車的數目實施總量控制，並會在下一階段透過附屬法例訂明有關數目。在訂定限額時，我們會小心審慎地考慮多個因素，包括市民的召車經驗、平台營運需要，公共交通系統生態，以及道路承載力等。

引入網約車規管制度有助大幅提升對乘客的保障。不過，考慮到可能仍有少數不法分子以私家車非法取酬載客，《條例草案》除了是就我剛才所說，對平台車輛以及司機都有作出明確的規管以及罰則外，我們藉着今次的《條例草案》亦加強罰則，以更有效打擊「白牌車」，保障乘客和合法合規的個人化點對點交通服務。根據現時法例，因非法取酬載客而被定罪的司機可被處監禁和罰款，亦可被停牌一段時間。為加強阻嚇力，《條例草案》訂明停牌時間須不少於12個月，並可長達三年。《條例草案》亦訂明若持牌平台安排沒有持有許可證的車輛或司機提供網約車服務，除了相關車主和司機可被處監禁和罰款外，持牌平台亦須負上刑責。

另外，根據現行法例，當司機因非法取酬載客被定罪後，運輸署可暫時吊銷涉事車輛的牌照，並扣押有關車輛一段期間。我們會藉着這次修改主體法例時引入這條《條例草案》內，建議強化暫時吊銷相關車輛牌照及扣押車輛的安排：當車輛涉嫌干犯非法取酬載客的罪行時，就算未能識辨涉事司機而作出刑事檢控，仍有機制暫時吊銷車輛牌照和扣押車輛。政府正敲定具體程序的細節，並積極進行相關的法律草擬工作。

主席，政府在推動網約車服務的規管框架時，一直秉持「以民為本、良性競爭、共存互補」的宗旨。我相信引入規管制度可有助重塑在香港個人化點對點公共交通服務，讓服務邁向現代化、司機年輕化和市民選擇多元化。政府會全力配合立法會的審議工作，我亦理解有關的立法工作相當緊迫和緊湊，我在此承諾我以及我的團隊會全力配合，並以高效回覆各議員以及在法案委員會提出的提問，我在此懇請議員支持《條例草案》，讓《條例草案》可趕及在今屆立法會會期完結前通過。

主席，我謹此陳辭。"

The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised six women, aged 23 to 48. Among them, two persons were current helpers, two persons were overstaying ex-helpers, and two persons were found to be holders of recognisance forms, which prohibit them from taking any employment in Hong Kong. ImmD investigators found most of the suspected illegal workers at restaurants performing dishwashing, cleaning, etc. Meanwhile, five suspected employers, comprising two men and three women, aged 29 to 50, were in charge of the involved companies or restaurants and suspected of employing the suspected illegal workers.

  ""A helper should only perform domestic duties for the employer specified in the contract. The helper should not take up any other employment, including part-time domestic duties, with any other person. The employer should not require or allow the helper to carry out any work for any other person,"" an ImmD spokesman said.

  The spokesman also said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him/her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  In addition, the spokesman warned that, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter, temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."
入境處打擊外傭違反逗留條件　共拘十一人（附圖）,2025-09-10 17:17,2025-09-10 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000634.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於九月五日至昨日（九月九日）一連五日在全港各區展開代號「劍魚」的反非法勞工行動。在該項打擊外籍家庭傭工（外傭）在港違反逗留條件的行動中，入境處共拘捕11名人士，包括六名懷疑非法勞工及五名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的人士。
​
行動中，入境處人員一共搜查了28個目標地點，包括酒樓、餐廳、酒吧、商業大廈及住宅單位等。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為六名女子，年齡介乎二十三至四十八歲。當中兩名為現職外傭、兩名為逾期逗留的前外傭、以及兩名為持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）人士。被捕的非法勞工主要在食肆從事洗碗及清潔等工作。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的五名人士為兩男三女，年齡介乎二十九至五十歲，他們均為涉案公司或餐廳的相關負責人。
​
入境處發言人說：「外傭只可以為合約上訂明的僱主料理家務。外傭不得受僱於其他人士擔任任何職務，包括兼職家務工作。僱主亦不得要求或容許傭工為其他人士擔任任何工作。」
​
入境處發言人強調：「任何人違反對他／她有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」
​
此外，入境處發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。」
​
發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰會由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。
​
根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。
​
入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外傭）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"

立法會二十二題：長者健康中心,2025-09-10 17:10,2025-09-10 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000532.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上陳振英議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

衞生署在全港設有18間長者健康中心，65歲或以上的長者可申請成為會員，但據悉目前輪候成為新會員時間較長，截至今年六月，該18間中心仍在處理二○二三年或更早期遞交的申請。另一方面，為減少服務重疊，基層醫療署計劃將長者健康中心的服務分階段整合至各區的地區康健中心。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年各區長者健康中心的以下資料：接獲的會員申請宗數、新增會員及總會員人數、申請成為會員的平均輪候時間，以及健康檢查、治療、注射及敷藥等主要服務的平均輪候時間；

（二）有否檢視長者健康中心處理會員申請需時甚長的原因為何；有否採取措施以提升處理會員申請的速度及效率；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）整合長者健康中心的服務至地區康健中心的時間表及過渡安排為何？

答覆：

主席：

為提升市民健康，改善醫療保障及質量，發揮醫療專業優勢，《行政長官2024年施政報告》提出，政府會全面審視醫療體系的定位和目標，改革衞生署、醫院管理局（醫管局）和基層醫療署的職能和分工，強化基層醫療，促進健康和疾病預防。衞生署會逐步把其專科和基層醫療服務分別轉移至醫管局和基層醫療署，以集中資源強化其規管事務和衞生防護等。其中，基層醫療署會分階段為整合衞生署轄下的長者健康中心服務至地區康健網絡作準備，以加強服務協同效應，按長者需要作適切安排。

就陳振英議員的提問，經諮詢衞生署後，本局現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）現時，衞生署在全港18區每區均設有一間長者健康中心，為年滿65歲的人士以家庭醫學模式提供綜合基層健康服務，包括健康評估、健康輔導、健康教育和診療服務。凡年滿65歲的人士均可到任何一間長者健康中心申請成為長者健康中心的會員。

另一方面，政府已於二○二二年在全港18區設立地區康健中心或地區康健站（以下統稱為地區康健中心）。現時，地區康健中心向所有市民（包括長者）提供健康風險評估、制定個人化健康計劃、登記參加「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」、配對家庭醫生和安排專屬護士診所及／或專職醫療服務等服務。

過去三年，在各長者健康中心每年接獲的新會員申請宗數載於下表。新申請宗數有下降趨勢，原因包括因應地區康健中心的設立，長者選擇到地區康健中心接受健康評估及服務等。

長者健康中心新登記人數及總登記人數在二○二四年均明顯下跌，而接受首次健康評估的輪候時間中位數在二○二四年則於大部分長者健康中心明顯較長。輪候時間中位數在該年較長的主要原因包括於2019冠狀病毒病疫情期間，長者健康中心由二○二○年一月至二○二三年二月只能提供有限度的服務而積壓部分申請。另外，雖然二○二三年二月開始，長者健康中心的服務已回復正常，但鑑於輪候申請人數已累積至一定數量，而且衞生署醫生人手持續短缺，影響了服務量，這也導致二○二四年的新登記人數及總登記人數下跌。

衞生署與基層醫療署商討分階段整合長者健康中心服務至地區康健網絡的同時，亦已增聘了合約醫生以加強人手應對，並會繼續密切監察情況。

（三）考慮到現時長者健康中心的服務容量，政府有需要改變服務模式，更好利用社區基層醫療資源，以提升服務效率，應對人口老化相關醫療需求的迫切問題。

為加強香港基層醫療服務，政府於二○二二年十二月公布《基層醫療健康藍圖》（《藍圖》），重點提出一系列改革措施。隨着以地區為本、以家庭為中心的社區醫療系統不斷發展，《藍圖》建議衞生署轄下的一些基層醫療健康服務，包括長者健康中心，應逐步並有序地整合至基層醫療系統，以便發展社區醫療系統，提供整體及全面的基層醫療服務，提升資源運用效率。為落實《藍圖》和《行政長官2024年施政報告》宣布的基層醫療政策方向及相關措施，基層醫療署會透過服務整合，進一步發展以地區康健中心為樞紐的跨專業基層醫療服務網絡。

基層醫療署計劃在二○二五至二六年度開始分階段為整合衞生署轄下的長者健康中心服務至地區康健網絡作準備，以加強服務協同效應，更好應對長者對基層醫療服務的需求。基層醫療署與衞生署將於稍後公布服務過渡的安排。"
​一名入境旅客管有未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-09-10 17:10,2025-09-10 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000637.htm,"一名入境女旅客因管有未完稅香煙和未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（九月十日）在粉嶺裁判法院被判處監禁八星期及罰款六百元。

海關人員昨日（九月九日）在羅湖管制站截查該名四十四歲抵港女旅客，在其攜帶的個人行李內檢獲一千五百八十一支未完稅香煙，估計市值約六千四百元，應課稅值約五千二百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，反映即使旅客屬初犯，亦可能被判處監禁，刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
LCQ22: Elderly Health Centres,2025-09-10 17:10,2025-09-10 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000541.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Chun-ying and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  The Department of Health has 18 Elderly Health Centres (EHCs) in Hong Kong. Elderly aged 65 and above can be enrolled as members of EHCs. However, it is learnt that the current waiting time for membership is relatively long. As at June this year, these 18 centres were still processing applications submitted in 2023 or earlier. On the other hand, to minimise service duplication, the Primary Healthcare Commission plans to migrate EHC services to District Health Centres (DHCs) in various districts in phases. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following information about the EHC in various districts in each of the past three years: the number of membership applications received, the number of new members and total membership, the average waiting time for membership applications, and the average waiting time for major services such as health screening, medical treatment, injection and dressing;

(2) whether it has examined the reasons for the lengthy processing time for membership applications at EHCs; whether it has taken measures to enhance the speed and efficiency of processing membership applications; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) of the timetable and transitional arrangements for migrating EHC services to DHCs?

Reply:

President,

  To enhance the health of the people of Hong Kong, improve healthcare protection and quality, and capitalise on our healthcare professions' strengths, as announced in ""The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address"", the Government will conduct a comprehensive review on the positioning and objectives of the healthcare system, which will cover the reforming of functions and division of work among the Department of Health (DH), the Hospital Authority (HA), and the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) as well as strengthening health promotion and disease prevention in primary healthcare. The DH will gradually transfer its specialist and primary healthcare services to the HA and the PHC Commission respectively, so as to concentrate its resources to strengthen its regulatory affairs and health protection, etc. Amongst others, the PHC Commission will start preparing for the service integration of the DH's Elderly Health Centres (EHCs) into the district health network in phases, with a view to enhancing service synergy and making appropriate arrangements to meet the needs of the elderly.

  In consultation with the DH, the reply by the Health Bureau to the question raised by the Hon Chan Chun-ying are as follows:

(1) and (2) At present, the DH has established an EHC in each of the 18 districts in Hong Kong to provide integrated primary healthcare services, including health assessment, counselling, health education and curative treatment, to persons aged 65 or above from a family medicine perspective. All persons aged 65 or above are eligible for enrolling as members of the EHC at any EHC.

  Meanwhile, the Government has set up District Health Centres (DHCs) or DHC Expresses (hereinafter collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts of Hong Kong in 2022. Currently, the DHCs provide services to all members of the public (including the elderly), including provision of health risk factors assessments, development of personalised health plans, signing up for the Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme, family doctor pairing, and arrangements for dedicated nurse clinics and/or allied health services.

  The number of new membership applications received annually by each EHC in the past three years are as shown in the table below. The number of new applications has shown a declining trend in view of factors such as the establishment of the DHCs and the elderly's preference for receiving health assessments and services at the DHCs.

Note: Due to the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, all EHCs underwent multiple service adjustments from 2020 to early 2023 to redeploy staff from different grades to support epidemic prevention and control. Amongst others, in view of the activation of designated clinics at Robert Black General Out-patient Clinic by the HA, based on infection control considerations at the time of the epidemic, San Po Kong EHC which was situated at the same location with the designated clinic was temporarily closed in the period from February 26, 2022, to February 5, 2023.

  The median waiting time for the first health assessment at various EHCs over the past three years is as shown in the table below. The median refers to the time the elderlies have taken to become a member and receive the first health assessment on the day since they first submitted the application.

  The number of new enrolments and total number of enrolments at the EHCs both declined significantly in 2024. Meanwhile, the median waiting time for the first health assessment was notably longer at most EHCs in 2024. Key factors contributing to the longer median waiting time in that year include the backlog of applications accumulated during the COVID-19 epidemic when the EHCs could only provide limited services from January 2020 to February 2023. Additionally, although services at the EHCs resumed normal starting from February 2023, the accumulated backlog of waiting applications and the persistent shortage of the DH's medical staff have impacted the service capacity. This has also contributed to the decline in both the number of new enrolments and the total number of enrolments in 2024.

  In addition to discussing service integration of EHCs into the district health network in phases with the PHC Commission, the DH has also recruited additional contract doctors to strengthen staffing capacity. The DH will continue to closely monitor the situation.

(3) Considering the current service capacity of the EHCs, there is a need for the Government to transform its service model to allow for better utilisation of community-based primary healthcare resources, enhance service efficiency, and respond to the pressing healthcare demands arising from an ageing population.

  To strengthen primary healthcare services in Hong Kong, the Government released the Primary Healthcare Blueprint (the Blueprint) in December 2022, setting out a series of reform initiatives. The Blueprint recommends that, in line with the development of the district-based, family-centric community health system, certain primary healthcare services under the DH, including the EHCs, be migrated to the primary healthcare system in a progressive and orderly manner. The migration aims to develop a community healthcare system that provides holistic and comprehensive primary healthcare services and utilises resources in a more effective manner. To implement the policy directions and related measures for primary healthcare set out in the Blueprint and the Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address, the PHC Commission will further expand the multidisciplinary primary healthcare service network with DHCs as hub through service integration.

  The PHC Commission plans to commence preparations in phases starting from 2025-26 for the service integration of EHCs under the DH into the district health network, with a view to enhancing service synergy and better addressing the elderly's demand for primary healthcare services. The PHC Commission and the DH will announce the service migration arrangements in due course."
Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2025-09-10 17:10,2025-09-10 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000638.htm,"  An incoming female passenger was sentenced to eight weeks' imprisonment and fined $600 by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (September 10) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

  Customs officers intercepted the incoming 44-year-old female passenger at the Lo Wu Control Point yesterday (September 9) and seized 1 581 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $6,400 and a duty potential of about $5,200 from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

  Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

  Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Hong Kong Customs detects smuggling case involving ocean-going vessel with goods worth about $140 million seized (with photo),2025-09-10 16:45,2025-09-10 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000582.htm,"Hong Kong Customs on August 26 detected a suspected case of using an ocean-going vessel to smuggle goods to Korea at the Kwai Chung Container Terminals. A large batch of suspected unmanifested goods with an estimated market value of about $140 million was seized.

Through intelligence analysis and risk assessment, Customs discovered that criminals intended to use an ocean-going vessel to smuggle goods and thus formulated strategies to combat related activities.

On August 26, Customs officers identified an ocean-going vessel preparing to depart from Hong Kong for Korea for inspection, and seized a large batch of suspected scheduled shark skin, electronic goods and parts, and liquor inside two containers on board the vessel.

An investigation is ongoing. The likelihood of arrests is not ruled out.

Customs is the primary agency responsible for tackling smuggling activities and has long been combating various smuggling activities on all fronts. Customs will keep up its enforcement action and continue to resolutely combat sea smuggling activities through proactive risk management and intelligence-based enforcement strategies, and carry out targeted anti-smuggling operations at suitable times to crack down on related crimes.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Speech by SJ at thematic breakout session of 10th Belt and Road Summit (English only) (with photos),2025-09-10 16:34,2025-09-10 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000569.htm,"Following are the welcome remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the thematic breakout session entitled Synergy in Legal Solutions: Co-creating a Shared Silk Road Vision of the 10th Belt and Road Summit today (September 10):

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is my great pleasure to welcome you all to join us in this thematic breakout session, which will focus on the legal and dispute resolution services provided by Hong Kong in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI). Before we hear from a distinguished panel of speakers, let me give a brief overview.

  Under the fundamental principle of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong enjoys a number of unique systematic strengths. Among other things, one of such strengths is its international, credible and high-quality legal and dispute resolution services based on its common law system against the background that Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction in China.

  The conclusion and execution of Belt and Road projects, irrespective of their nature, are bound to involve transboundary legal issues. In order to safeguard and promote the parties' interests, and as an essential component of risk management, international legal services are inevitable.

Non-contentious legal services

  Let me start with non-contentious legal services, for example, the drafting of contracts and other legal documents, the provision of general legal advices, and the establishment of business entities.

  All Belt and Road co-operation agreements would need to be reduced into legally enforceable contracts. When the parties come from different jurisdictions and the execution of the project itself involves different countries, one of the most important primary question is to decide on the governing law of the legal agreement. I would venture to suggest that Hong Kong law provides one of the best options. We have a bilingual legal system under which both Chinese and English are equally authentic. Our common law, in particular, international civil and commercial law and practice, are very familiar to the international business community. In the IMD (International Institute for Management Development) World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025 published in June this year, Hong Kong ranks first in the world in the sub-factor ""Business legislation"".

  One unique characteristic of our common law system is that, while it is separated from the legal system in Mainland, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) and the Mainland have entered into a number of mutual legal assistance arrangements, which would enable overseas parties to explore business opportunities in the Mainland while enjoying the benefits offered by Hong Kong's legal system. For example, these arrangements cover the mutual recognition and enforcement of court judgments in civil and commercial matters, and also arbitral awards.

  To take full advantage of the benefits offered by Hong Kong's legal system, it is most advisable to consider setting up business and corporate vehicles in Hong Kong for the purpose of executing co-operation or joint-venture agreements under the B&RI. The most obvious and important advantage is that Hong Kong entities would be entitled to all the tax benefits under Hong Kong law. In the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025 which I mentioned a moment ago, Hong Kong also ranks first in the sub-factor ""Tax policy"". And, of course, Hong Kong corporate vehicles may be conveniently used to raise finance and capital to fund Belt and Road projects in Hong Kong, which is one of the most important international financial centres in the world. There are also other privileges which are only available to Hong Kong enterprises. Let me give you one example: since mid-February this year, Hong Kong enterprises, including companies with some Hong Kong interests irrespective of the extent thereof, in the major cities of the Greater Bay Area in Guangdong Province, now enjoy the option to choose Hong Kong law as the governing law of their contracts with other Mainland enterprises, and to choose Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration for resolving disputes.

  It is indisputable that Hong Kong has an abundant supply of legal professionals who are highly regarded by the international community. With rich experience and strong expertise in international business, commercial, financial and investment law, our legal professionals serve as ""global"" lawyers in the sense that, apart from providing legal services related to Hong Kong law, they are able to advise and provide services on legal issues involving other jurisdictions in the light of their good and extensive connections with other jurisdictions. Currently, 280 law firms in Hong Kong have overseas offices, 85 have representative offices in the Mainland; there are 27 registered associations of firms formed jointly by local and foreign laws, 85 foreign law firms and more than 1 600 foreign lawyers.

Dispute resolution services

  Let me now move on to dispute resolution services. The starting point is that, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", our Judiciary enjoys the independent power of adjudication including that of final adjudication. In our highest court, namely the Court of Final Appeal, apart from local judges, eminent judges from other common law jurisdictions such as the UK (United Kingdom), Australia and New Zealand have been invited to sit as foreign non-permanent judges to ensure that our common law jurisprudence will be of the highest quality and meet the expectations of the international community.

  Turning to other modes of dispute resolution, Hong Kong is well regarded as one of the top international arbitration centres. According to the 2025 International Arbitration Survey conducted by Queen Mary University of London, Hong Kong ranks as the second most preferred seat for arbitration globally and the first in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2024, 76.4 per cent of the arbitrations submitted to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC) were international in nature. B&RI countries and jurisdictions account for the majority of the geographical origins or nationalities of arbitrators appointed, as well as parties participating in HKIAC arbitrations. Our Judiciary is also renowned for its strong pro-arbitration stance.

It is impossible not to mention mediation. The establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) is an important supplement to the current international dispute settlement regime, marking a milestone in promoting the settlement of international disputes, which include disputes between a government and foreign nationals and also international commercial disputes, through mediation. The Signing Ceremony of the Convention on the Establishment of the IOMed was held in Hong Kong on May 30, 2025. Up to date, 36 countries, including China, have signed the Convention, and I believe all of them are B&RI countries. It is noteworthy that the headquarters of the IOMed is situated in Hong Kong; and subject to rules to be made by IOMed, the government and nationals of state parties who have not yet signed or ratified the Convention will also be entitled to use the service of the IOMed.

Capacity building

  We also see capacity building as an important component of international legal collaborations. The Department of Justice (DoJ) established the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy in November 2024. The Academy provides tailor-made training programmes in collaboration with different jurisdictions and international organisations on topics including international law, international arbitration, Hong Kong common law, and so on and so forth.

Collaboration with BR&I countries

  The Hong Kong Government is committed to enhancing legal collaborations with Belt and Road countries and the Mainland to assist in the construction of B&RI. The seventh Hong Kong Legal Services Forum was held in Xi'an, a key strategic city in western China under the B&RI, in May this year, and the theme was about cross-border transactions and foreign investment under the B&RI.

  Memoranda of Understanding on legal co-operation were signed with the Minister of Justice of Saudi Arabia and the Minister of Commerce of Cambodia in April last year and May this year respectively. I am very pleased that, just this morning, my department also signed a Memorandum of Co-operation with the Ministry of Law and Justice of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on strengthening co-operation on dispute avoidance and resolution. This Memorandum is the sixth with jurisdictions along the Belt and Road.

  Furthermore, since I assumed my present position as the Secretary for Justice, I have organised a number of trips leading a delegation consisting of legal professionals from Hong Kong to visit various Belt and Road countries in the Middle East and South East Asia.

  All in all, I firmly believe that Hong Kong will be of great assistance to all friends taking part in Belt and Road projects by providing one-stop legal services covering the whole business cycle of such projects, from inception to fruition. Our international, credible and top-quality legal professionals are ready, willing and able to serve and fight for your best interests.

  Looking ahead, the DoJ will continue to use different means to enhance legal co-operations and collaborations with other jurisdictions along the Belt and Road, and to promote and refine our legal and dispute resolution services to ensure that they will meet the expectations and demands of potential and actual users. On this note, I wish you all a constructive and enjoyable session this afternoon. Thank you."

Our international, credible and top-quality legal professionals are ready, willing and able to serve and fight for your best interests.

  Looking ahead, the DoJ will continue to use different means to enhance legal co-operations and collaborations with other jurisdictions along the Belt and Road, and to promote and refine our legal and dispute resolution services to ensure that they will meet the expectations and demands of potential and actual users. On this note, I wish you all a constructive and enjoyable session this afternoon. Thank you."
立法會六題：遙距醫療服務的發展,2025-09-10 16:25,2025-09-10 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000531.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上陳永光議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的答覆︰

問題：

關於遙距醫療服務的發展，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據悉醫院管理局（醫管局）透過「HA Go」流動應用程式及供醫護人員使用的臨床管理系統提供遙距醫療服務，政府是否知悉，至今醫管局透過該等途徑提供了多少次遙距診症服務，以及涉及的病人數目為何；醫護人員和病人對該等服務的意見反饋分別為何；

（二）是否知悉，過去三年政府及相關公營機構收到多少宗有關遙距醫療服務的投訴，以及該等投訴的內容及跟進情況分別為何；及

（三）鑑於消費者委員會早前公布的一項研究指出，現時消費者透過WhatsApp及Zoom等應用程式接受遙距醫療服務存在私隱風險問題，當局會否考慮加強醫健通或「HA Go」流動應用程式的功能，讓私營醫療服務提供者能夠透過該等平台及應用程式為病人提供遙距醫療服務，以加強對個人資料和健康數據的保護，並促進遙距醫療服務的發展？

答覆：

主席：

遙距醫療是醫療服務，必須由合資格醫護人員提供，並受相關醫護專業的管理局及委員會監管。醫護人員有責任確保通過遙距醫療提供的服務符合規管機構的守則及指引，並切合病人的臨床情況和臨床目標，醫護人員的專業水平絕不應因為服務模式不同而有所妥協。香港醫務委員會的遙距醫療實務道德規範指引清晰指出，醫生需要了解任何遙距醫療應用和電子通訊的局限性，如果技術和環境限制影響遙距醫療服務，以致無法滿足醫生執業的專業標準及謹慎責任，則必須考慮替代方案。

雖然政府鼓勵業界通過創新方式提供醫療服務，非醫護專業人員及企業不應作不實宣傳，甚至提供遙距醫療。政府會審視遙距醫療的廣告有否違反《不良廣告（醫藥）條例》（第231章）的規定，以及其服務有否違反其他法例下無牌執業的規定。

就陳永光議員的提問，現綜合回覆如下：

2019冠狀病毒病疫情期間，香港的遙距醫療服務開始普及，在非常時期作為一個重要的抗疫政策。遙距醫療存在一定局限，例如較難建立醫患關係，亦未必適合需實地接受臨床身體檢查以作出診治的病人。此外，遙距醫療服務亦依賴穩定的技術基礎設施，網絡、設備或其他技術問題都可能會影響服務質量。要求病人具備相關設備，可能會增加時間成本和技術門檻，尤其是一些較年長或不熟悉科技的病人。

因應2019冠狀病毒病疫情的情況，醫院管理局（醫管局）開始發展遙距醫療作為輔助，並一直謹慎處理遙距醫療的局限。一般而言，遙距醫療較適用於慢性病患而病情穩定、並非新症以及無須親臨醫院接受醫生臨床檢查的病人。醫管局會視乎病人的臨床情況穩定性、臨床需要及實際運作情況以安排遙距診症的醫療服務。由二○二二年四月至二○二五年三月的三年期間，參與遙距醫療的非新冠個案超過34萬宗，包括社區老人評估小組為安老院舍長者提供的遙距診症、專職醫療（如臨床心理學家服務）和專科門診服務。藥劑部亦會透過遙距方法提供用藥指導服務。

醫管局的遙距醫療服務自推展以來運作大致順暢，病人反應正面，普遍認為流程簡單易用，尤其是為居住在偏遠地區或行動不便的病人帶來方便。過去三年，醫管局共收到兩宗有關遙距醫療服務的投訴，主要涉及未能使病人清晰了解服務流程，例如預約及領取藥物和轉介信的安排。醫管局已隨即向有關病人詳細解釋及跟進情況。醫管局會繼續定期檢討遙距診症的應用效果，令服務更切合病人需要和符合成本效益。

醫管局的「HA Go」流動應用程式目標是協助病人管理其在公立醫院及診所的服務，並不適合供私營醫療服務提供者或其他病人使用。另一方面，政府現正推展「醫健通+」五年計劃，將醫健通提升為一個集合數據互通、服務提供以及流程管理於一身的綜合醫療資訊基建，以更有效地支援各項醫療政策。在考慮「醫健通+」的發展時，我們須審慎衡量相關功能的適切性、所需公共資源運用的效益、資料私隱和系統保安措施等相關因素。

政府會繼續密切留意遙距醫療服務在香港的推展及普及情況，與業界及相關持份者共同探討遙距醫療在合適的服務，例如外展服務和護士診所、專職醫療服務等基層醫療服務方面的進一步發展。政府並將確保各個醫護專業的管理局及委員會按照行業特色和實務需要，訂出並適時修訂遙距醫療的具體指引，以期保障病人和醫護人員的權益。

多謝主席。"
LCQ6: Development of telemedicine services,2025-09-10 16:25,2025-09-10 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000551.htm,"  Following is a question by Professor the Hon Chan Wing-kwong and a reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  Regarding the development of telemedicine services, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is learnt that the Hospital Authority (HA) provides telemedicine services through the ""HA Go"" mobile application and the clinical management system used by healthcare professionals, whether the Government knows the number of tele-consultation services provided by the HA through these channels to date, the number of patients involved as well as the respective feedback from healthcare professionals and patients on these services;

(2) whether it knows the number of complaints concerning telemedicine services received by the Government and relevant public organisations in the past three years, and the content and follow-up situations respectively of those complaints; and

(3) as a study released earlier on by the Consumer Council has pointed out the privacy risks involved when consumers receive telemedicine services through applications such as WhatsApp and Zoom nowadays, whether the authorities will consider strengthening the functionality of eHealth or ""HA Go"" mobile applications, so that private healthcare service providers can provide telemedicine services to patients through these platforms and applications, so as to enhance the protection of personal information and health data, and promote the development of telemedicine services?

Reply:

President,

  Telehealth is a type of medical service that should be provided by qualified healthcare professionals and governed by the regulatory boards and councils of relevant healthcare professions. Healthcare professionals have the responsibility to ensure services provided through telehealth comply with the codes and guidelines promulgated by regulatory authorities, are suited for the clinical setting and objective of patients, and must not compromise the professional standard because of service modes. The Medical Council of Hong Kong's Ethical Guidelines on Practice of Telemedicine stipulates clearly that doctors need to be aware of the limits of any telehealth applications and electronic communications, and alternatives must be considered if technical and environmental limitations affect telehealth services as to compromising the professional standard and duty of care of medical practices.

  While the Government encourages professions to provide medical services by innovative means, non-healthcare professionals and companies must not untruthfully promote or even provide telehealth. The Government will scrutinise advertisement on telehealth to ascertain whether there are violation of the Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance (Cap. 231) and whether the services so provided have violated regulations under other legislations concerning practising without a licence.

  In response to the questions raised by Professor the Hon Chan Wing-kwong, my consolidated reply is as follows:

  During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth services became prevalent in Hong Kong, being an important anti-epidemic strategy during the critical period. Telehealth has certain limitations, for instance, the establishment of a doctor-patient relationship may prove challenging, and such services may not be suitable for patients requiring in-person clinical examinations for diagnosis. Furthermore, telehealth services rely on stable technological infrastructure. Issues such as network stability, equipment, or other technical problems may affect service quality. Requiring patients to possess related equipment may increase time costs and technological threshold, particularly for elderly patients or those not familiar with technology.

  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hospital Authority (HA) has started to develop telehealth as a complementary measure, and has been managing the limitations of telehealth cautiously. Generally speaking, telehealth services are more suitable for chronic patients who are clinically stable, not new cases as well as those who do not need to visit hospitals to undergo clinical examinations by doctors. The HA will arrange medical services through telehealth, having taken into account the stability of the clinical conditions of patients, their clinical needs, and actual operational situations. During the three years from April 2022 to March 2025, telehealth was involved in more than 340000 non-COVID-19 cases, including tele-consultations provided by the Community Geriatric Assessment Teams for elderly living in residential care homes for the elderly, allied health (e.g. clinical psychology service) and specialist out-patient services. The pharmacies also provide drug counselling services through remote means.

  The HA's telehealth services have been operating smoothly since inception, with positive feedback from patients who generally consider the workflow simple and user-friendly, and particularly convenient for patients residing in remote areas or with mobility difficulties. Over the past three years, the HA received two complaints regarding telehealth services that mainly involved patients not being clearly informed about the service workflow, such as arrangements regarding booking appointments, drug collection and referral letters. The HA had promptly provided detailed explanations and followed up with the patients concerned. The HA will continue to regularly review the impact after the application of telehealth to ensure the services can better meet patients' needs while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

  The HA's ""HA Go"" app is designed to assist its patients in managing their services in public hospitals and clinics, and is not suitable for use by private healthcare providers or other patients. On the other hand, the Government is implementing the ""eHealth+"" five-year development plan to upgrade eHealth into a comprehensive healthcare information infrastructure that integrates data sharing, service delivery and process management, with a view to supporting various healthcare policies more effectively. In considering the development of ""eHealth+"", we have to carefully assess the relevant factors, such as the appropriateness of the relevant functions, the effective use of public resources, data privacy and system security.

  The Government will continue to closely monitor the development and adoption of telehealth services in Hong Kong, and will work with the sector and relevant stakeholders to explore the further development of telehealth in suitable services, such as outreach services and primary healthcare services including nurse clinics and allied health services, etc. The Government will also ensure boards and councils of various healthcare professions would promulgate and review specific guidelines on telehealth in a timely manner based on professional practice and operational needs, with a view to protecting the interests of patients and healthcare professionals.

  Thank you, President."

根據調查結果，以上水浸個案主要是由於暴雨期間，大量枯葉及雜物被沖至位處於低窪的路邊集水溝、進水口及排水道，並造成阻塞，令雨水難以進入下游的雨水收集及排放系統，引致水浸情況。上述水浸個案均於一至兩小時內完成處理及清除積水。

（二）至（四）渠務署會定期為公共雨水排放系統進行巡查、清理及維修保養。以大嶼山南區為例，今年截至八月，署方已為公共雨水排放系統完成28次巡查及渠道清理工作。

渠務署與天文台緊密聯繫，當預測暴雨即將來臨時，渠務署會實施「及時清渠」安排，調配人手巡查容易受枯葉及雜物等阻塞的位置，並清理淤塞的渠道，以減低大雨期間的水浸風險。此外，每當天文台發出紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號、新界北部水浸特別報告、八號或以上熱帶氣旋警告信號，渠務署便會即時啓動緊急事故控制中心，並派遣緊急應變隊伍處理市民求助個案，清理水浸情況。

現時，全港約有240個渠道容易淤塞點，當中多於一半位於新界及離島地區，包括四個位於大嶼山南區。為進一步強化緊急事故控制中心在極端天氣情況下的應變能力，渠務署已增加緊急應變隊伍的數目，由去年160隊擴展至今年180隊，以及設立超過30個分布全港各區的應急運作基地，當中位處梅窩的應急運作基地能迅速派遣緊急應變隊伍到大嶼山南區（包括鹹田村或十塱村等地）應對水浸事件。

每當暴雨過後，渠務署均會檢視每個水浸個案的成因，並與相關部門探討並按需要進行合適的排水系統改善工程以緩減水浸風險。因應最近暴雨引致的水浸事故，政府正計劃在鹹田村和十塱村進行排水設施改善工程，例如加設排水管道，以及為居民安裝擋水裝置提供技術支援。

渠務署為市民應對水浸事件推行多項支援措施，包括設立24小時電話熱線（2300 1110），以便更有效直接接收水浸個案報告，讓渠務署可快速處理。另外，各相關政府部門，例如民政事務總署、路政署及食物環境衞生署亦會定期巡查及清理相關的雨水排放設施。渠務署會與各相關部門保持緊密聯繫，確保公共雨水排放系統正常運作。渠務署亦會繼續與地區人士保持溝通及聽取居民的意見，以進一步減低有關地區的水浸風險。"

Question:

 The Hong Kong Observatory has recently issued the Black Rainstorm Signal on multiple occasions. It is learnt that consecutive rainstorms have caused serious flooding in a number of rural areas, including South Lantau Road on Lantau Island, Ham Tin Kau Tsuen and Ham Tin San Tsuen (Ham Tin Tsuen), Shap Long Kau Tsuen and Shap Long San Tsuen (Shap Long Tsuen), and Yung Shue Wan on Lamma Island. After the consecutive black rainstorms, I have visited Ham Tin Tsuen and Shap Long Tsuen, where a relatively large number of elderly persons reside. Local villagers have relayed that flooding into houses occurred during every rainstorm, causing all their electrical appliances and wiring to be soaked and posing dangers; however, when villagers telephoned the relevant government departments for assistance, no immediate handling was provided, resulting in heavy losses on their part and leaving them at a loss. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the numbers of flooding reports from villages in South Lantau received by the authorities in each of the past five years; the main causes for the occurrence of flooding in such cases; the handling time required and outcome for each case respectively;

(2) regarding the situation of flooding into houses and damage to wiring and electrical appliances occur during every rainstorm relayed by the aforesaid villagers, of the immediate or long-term remedial measures that the Government will adopt;

(3) whether it has regularly (for example, annually or quarterly) inspected and cleared the drainage channels in the aforesaid areas to ensure proper functioning of the drainage systems; if so, of the situation of blockage of drainage channels found during the inspections, as well as the respective numbers of relevant inspections and clearances; and

(4) in the face of increasingly frequent extreme weather events, of the measures in place to assist villagers in the aforesaid areas (especially elderly persons) to enhance their capabilities in coping with rainstorms and flooding; whether it will strengthen the support for them under rainstorms and flooding in future (for example, setting up a dedicated hotline or a response team)?

Reply:

President,

 In coping with extreme weather, the Government has developed a forward-looking Integrated Flood Management Strategy under a framework of advanced emergency preparedness, enhanced early warning, decisive emergency response and speedy recovery, to combat the impacts brought by climate change. This strategy aims to integrate adaptation, response, and management to enhance the overall flood resilience of Hong Kong. Regarding the situation in rural areas, in addition to carrying out improvement works to local drainage systems, the Government is also continuously strengthening related flood management work to enhance the flood protection abilities.

 My respective replies to the various parts of the Hon KennethLau's question are as follows:

(1) Over the past five years (from 2020 to August 2025), the Drainage Services Department (DSD) has confirmed seven flooding cases in South Lantau. The details are as follows:




Year
No. of Confirmed Flooding Case


2025 (up to August)

 According to the investigation results, the aforementioned flooding cases were primarily caused by heavy rainfall, during which a large amount of fallen leaves and debris were washed into low-lying roadside gullies, intakes, and drainage channels, leading to blockages. This hindered the natural flow of rainwater into the downstream stormwater collection and drainage systems, leading to flooding. All of these flooding cases were handled and resolved within one to two hours.

(2) to (4) The DSD conducts regular inspections, cleansing, and maintenance of public stormwater drainage systems. For example in South Lantau, the department has completed 28 inspections and cleansing operations for the public stormwater drainage system as of August this year.

 The DSD maintains close collaboration with the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). Before the onset of a heavy rainstorm, the department implements a ""just-in-time clearance"" arrangement. Manpower will be deployed to inspect and clear drains that are prone to blockages caused by fallen leaves and debris, so as to reduce the risk of flooding during heavy rain. Additionally, when the HKO issues a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal, a Special Announcement on Flooding in the northern New Territories or a Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal of number 8 or above, the DSD will immediately activate its Emergency Control Centre and deploy emergency response teams to address public requests for assistance and handle flooding cases.

 Currently, there are approximately 240 drainage points in Hong Kong that are prone to blockage, more than half of which are located in the New Territories and Islands, including four in South Lantau. To further enhance the response capabilities of Emergency Control Centre during extreme weather conditions, the DSD has increased the number of emergency response teams from 160 last year to 180 this year. Additionally, over 30 emergency operation stations across the territories have been established. The emergency operation station at Mui Wo can quickly deploy emergency response teams to South Lantau, including areas such as Ham Tin Village and Shap Long Village to tackle flooding incidents.

 Following every heavy rainstorm, the DSD reviews the causes of each flooding case and collaborates with relevant departments to discuss and implement necessary drainage improvement works, aimed at mitigating flood risks. In response to recent flooding incidents caused by heavy rain, the Government plans to carry out drainage improvement works in Ham Tin Village and Shap Long Village, such as installing additional drainage pipes and providing technical support for residents to install flood barriers.

 The DSD has implemented several support measures to help the public to cope with flooding incidents. These include establishing a 24-hour hotline (2300 1110) to efficiently receive and swiftly handling flooding reports. In addition, relevant government departments, such as the Home Affairs Department, the Highways Department, and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, conduct regular inspections and cleansing of related stormwater drainage facilities. The DSD maintains close liaison with these departments to ensure the proper functioning of the public stormwater drainage system. The DSD will continue to liaise with the local community and gather feedback from citizens with a view to further reducing the flooding risks in the affected areas."

Question:

  It is learnt that in recent years, the Government has actively promoted urban renewal, replacing large-scale redevelopment with a ""rehabilitation first"" strategy to improve building structural safety and prolong their lifespan. Members of the public have recently relayed to me that, even when rehabilitation works have been completed for the buildings and safety standards met to prolong their service life, banks still adopt the ""75 minus building age"" calculation method (i.e. residential properties over 55 years old can only be granted a maximum mortgage term of 20 years) when assessing mortgage applications. This not only adds to the burden of down payments and monthly mortgage payments on members of the public, but also reduces the liquidity of old buildings. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is learnt that the Government is vigorously promoting building rehabilitation as an alternative to redevelopment, whether the authorities have discussed with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority the possibility of appropriately extending the mortgage term for buildings that have completed rehabilitation and passed safety inspections; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether the Government will consider establishing a certification mechanism for buildings that have completed prescribed inspections and prescribed repairs, so that banks may consider extending the mortgage term when approving mortgages for such buildings; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it has compiled statistics on the following information of residential properties currently aged 50 years or above: (i) the total number, (ii) the number of households having mortgages among them, and (iii) their median monthly mortgage payments and loan repayments; if it has not compiled statistics, of the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  After consulting the Development Bureau and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), our reply to the three parts of the question is as follows:

(1) & (2) The Government's strategy for building renewal emphasises both rehabilitation and redevelopment. The Buildings Department (BD) annually selects about 600 private buildings (Note 1) aged 30 years or above on a risk basis and the owners of such building served with statutory mandatory building inspection notices (MBI notices) are required to carry out inspections and repairs for the common parts of their buildings and the projections of the individual units. Among the 8 364 buildings served with MBI notices so far, about 70 per cent of them aged 50 years or above. Proper maintenance and repair of properties are owners' primary responsibility. It not only protects the safety of residents, buildings and the public, but also extends the buildings' lifespan, which has a positive impact on the property values.

  If the owners have complied with the requirements of the MBI notices, the BD will issue compliance letters to the owners. Besides, the public can enquire and view the service and compliance status of the statutory notices of the private buildings via the BD's website. Where owners have voluntarily arranged and carried out building inspection and repair in accordance with the requirements and procedures under the Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme, the BD will also issue acknowledgement letters to the owners.

  The HKMA does not set a specific mortgage term limit based on the age of a property. The approval of loans is a commercial decision made by banks. When processing mortgage applications, banks take into account a host of factors, including the borrower's repayment capacity and the condition of the building. The age of the property is only one of the factors of consideration. When considering whether to approve mortgage applications for a residential property, the abovementioned information issued by the BD regarding the completion of inspection and repair of the building may assist banks in evaluating the condition of the building.

(3) According to the BD's record, as at the end of 2024, there were 8 977 private residential buildings aged 50 years or above (excluding New Territories Exempted Houses). As regards whether the units in those private residential buildings have a mortgage and the specific details about the mortgage loan payments and repayments, they are agreements reached between the property owners and the banks. The Government does not maintain relevant commercial data for statistical purposes.

立法會十七題：高樓齡樓宇的按揭年期,2025-09-10 15:30,2025-09-10 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000369.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上洪雯議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉政府近年積極推動市區更新，以「復修為先」的策略取代大規模重建，藉此改善樓宇結構安全，以延長樓宇壽命。本人近日接獲市民反映，即使樓宇已完成復修工程並符合安全標準，令其使用年期得以延長，但銀行在審批按揭時仍採用「75減樓齡」的計算方法（即樓齡逾55年的住宅物業只能獲批最長20年的按揭年期），這不但加重了市民在首期及每月按揭供款的負擔，也減低舊樓的流通性。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據悉政府大力推動樓宇復修以取代重建，當局有否與香港金融管理局商討，適度調高已完成復修並通過安全檢驗的樓宇的按揭年期；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）政府會否考慮為已完成訂明檢驗及訂明修葺的樓宇設立認證機制，讓銀行在審批該等樓宇的按揭時可考慮延長按揭年期；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）有否統計現時樓齡50年或以上的住宅物業的以下資料：（i）整體數量、（ii）當中持有按揭的住戶數目，以及（iii）其每月按揭供款及借貸還款的中位數；如沒有統計，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就問題的三個部分，經諮詢發展局及香港金融管理局（金管局）後，現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）政府的樓宇更新策略是復修和重建並重。屋宇署每年會按風險揀選約600幢樓齡達30年或以上的私人樓宇（註一）發出強制驗樓法定通知（驗樓通知），着令業主為大廈的公用部分及個別單位的伸出物進行檢驗及修葺。至今獲發出驗樓通知的8 364幢樓宇，約百分之七十為樓齡50年或以上。妥善保養物業是業主責任，不但可保障住戶、建築物及公眾安全，也可延長樓宇的壽命，對維持物業價值有正面作用。

如業主完成驗樓通知的要求，屋宇署會向業主發信確認通知已獲遵辦。此外，公眾可透過屋宇署網站，查閱個別私人樓宇是否獲發法定通知，以及其遵辦情況。如業主沒有收到法定通知而自願按照強制驗樓計劃的要求完成檢驗及修葺，屋宇署亦會向相關業主發出證明信件。

金管局沒有就按揭物業的樓齡設立按揭年限。銀行的貸款審批是其自身商業決定，銀行在審批按揭申請時會考慮一籃子因素，包括借款人還款能力和樓宇狀況，當中物業的樓齡只是其中一個考慮因素。在考慮是否審批住宅按揭申請時，上述由屋宇署發出有關樓宇完成檢驗及修葺的資料相信會有助銀行評估樓宇狀況。

（三）根據屋宇署紀錄，截至二○二四年底，有8 977幢私人住宅樓宇的樓齡為50年或以上（不包括新界豁免管制屋宇）。至於該些私人住宅樓宇內的單位是否持有按揭、其按揭貸款的供款及還款的具體資料，由於是業主與銀行之間的協議，政府沒有備存相關商業數據作統計之用。

註一：樓高不超過三層的住用樓宇除外。"
