Speech by SCST at opening ceremony of LOCAL POWER 2025 Hong Kong Fashion in Seoul (English only),2025-09-27 14:55,2025-09-27 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700539.htm,"âFollowing is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the opening ceremony of LOCAL POWER 2025 Hong Kong Fashion in Seoul today (September 27):

Dorian (Founding Chairman of the Asian New Generation Creativity Design Association, Mr Dorian Ho), fashion designers from both Hong Kong and Korea, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Annyeonghaseyo (Korean: Hello). Good afternoon. It is my tremendous pleasure to join you for LOCAL POWER 2025 Hong Kong Fashion in Seoul. Thank you for joining us today, gathering here to witness the magic of fashion design and its power to foster cultural exchange and friendship between Hong Kong and Korea.

As the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, I have been eagerly anticipating today's event. I actually had a preview earlier this month at Hong Kong's own CENTRESTAGE fashion gala, and I was deeply impressed. Today's full showcase promises to be even more captivating, featuring over 70 unique designs from 30 emerging designers and brands from Hong Kong and other cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area), alongside five of Korea's top designers.

But LOCAL POWER 2025 is more than just a fashion show. It is an exciting, interactive experience, enhanced by artificial intelligence and brought to live with live Cantopop and K-pop performances. Through this hybrid showcase, you will get a true taste of Hong Kong's vibrant and diverse creative industries.

This event is a perfect example of our commitment, as outlined in our Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development, to strengthen the arts and creative ecosystem in Hong Kong. With Hong Kong's unique role as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange, we are proud to sponsor projects like this through our Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency, CCIDA. Our goal is to present our new generation of Greater Bay Area fashion design talents to the world, enhance their international exposure and help build powerful local brands.

As a key part of Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul, this groundbreaking collaboration provides a creative platform for elite designers from Hong Kong, the Greater Bay Area and Korea. It elevates our cultural and creative partnership to the next level. 

Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul was officially launched yesterday, bringing 14 selected programmes - about 65 performances and activities - to Korea, from dance and music to film, Chinese painting and comics. Your participation here today provides the momentum to further connect the creative talents of Hong Kong and Korea.

Speaking of connection, I would like to extend an invitation to you all. This coming November to December, Hong Kong will be hosting the Hong Kong Fashion Fest. As our Chief Executive outlined in his Policy Address, our vision is to develop Hong Kong into Asia's leading fashion design hub. The Hong Kong Fashion Fest is our annual spotlight event, a spectacular tapestry of design happenings across the city. This year, we are taking it a step further by collaborating with Paris and Milan Fashion Weeks to promote digital and sustainable fashion. I sincerely welcome all of you to join us in Hong Kong for this extravaganza. Please stay tuned for details.

Before I close, I must express my heartfelt appreciation to the Asian New Generation Creativity Design Association and Dorian himself, for organising this project. And my gratitude also goes to today's performing artists, Mr Chu Wan-pin, and Shownu and Hyungwon of MONSTA X, as well as various supporting organisations.

I wish LOCAL POWER 2025 Hong Kong Fashion in Seoul a roaring success, and all the participating designers a rewarding and inspiring journey fashion show and the exhibition that follows.

Thank you. Kamsahamnida (Korean: Thank you)."

第四屆粵港澳大灣區統計論壇圓滿舉行 （附圖）,2025-09-27 13:30,2025-09-27 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092500994.htm,"第四屆粵港澳大灣區統計論壇昨日（九月二十六日）以線上直播形式舉行。在國家統計局指導下，論壇由廣東省統計局主辦，並由廣州市統計局和廣州市黃埔區人民政府聯合承辦。政府統計處處長余振強與數名該處專業統計人員一同參與這項一年一度的盛事。

今年論壇的主題為「粵港澳大灣區統計創新與技術突破」，旨在促進粵港澳大灣區統計交流合作，讓「9+2」城市的統計專業人員可以集思廣益，以創新思維推動統計方法與技術的革新，攜手應󠇡對當前複雜多變的環境。除了國家統計局和廣東省統計局的領導參與，論壇亦匯聚了不同範疇的統計專家，包括來自粵港澳大灣區「9+2」城市的政府統計機構代表，以及中國內地高等院校和研究機構代表。

余振強在論壇開幕式致辭時表示，在推進統計改革與創新的道路上，統計處一直秉持「守正創新、先立後破」的工作方針。在堅守統計專業精神、保持客觀中立、尊重私隱和保障數據安全的前提下，他鼓勵同事勇於突破框架、積極擁抱新技術、追求卓越，持續提升工作成本效益和服務質量。

余振強亦闡述在當前瞬息萬變的數字時代，人工智能已經不單是一種工具，更是一股正在深刻改變工作方式和思維模式的強大力量。在統計領域中，海量數據的搜集、處理、分析和解讀往往耗時費力，而人工智能可以高效完成重複性的工作，釋放團隊更多精力和時間，專注於策略研判與創新應用。因此人工智能不但不會取代專業統計人員，反而會成為團隊中不可或缺的「新成員」，有效提升處理和分析數據的能力。

政府統計處高級統計師陳志豪亦在論壇中一個環節發表題為「數據科學在官方統計工作中的應用策略」的專題演講。參與論壇的統計處人員均表示，是次論壇讓他們了解到中國內地的統計技術正不斷深化，提醒他們在日新月異的大數據時代更要勇於創新和積極尋求突破，以迎接未來的機遇和挑戰。

是次論壇以線上形式舉辦，來自北京、廣東省、香港及澳門等的統計機構均有代表參與。大灣區各城市統計系統的相關人員，以及國家級智庫和知名高校專家學者，亦就數據科學技術的應用、統計人才培育、統計改革創新、經濟監測和預測等課題分享真知灼見。"
Fourth Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Statistical Forum successfully held (with photos),2025-09-27 13:30,2025-09-27 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092500998.htm,"The Fourth Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Statistical Forum was held yesterday (September 26) via live streaming. Under the guidance of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the forum was hosted by the Guangdong Provincial Bureau of Statistics (GPBS) and jointly organised by the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Statistics and the People's Government of Huangpu District of Guangzhou Municipality. The Commissioner for Census and Statistics, Mr Leo Yu, and some C&SD statistical professionals participated in this major annual event.

This year's forum, themed ""Statistical Innovation and Technological Breakthroughs in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area"", aimed to foster statistical exchange and co-operation in the GBA. It provided a platform for statistical professionals from the ""9+2"" cities to brainstorm collectively and drive innovation in statistical methods and technologies through creative thinking, jointly addressing the current complex and ever-changing environment.ãIn addition to the participation of leaders from the NBS and the GPBS, the forum brought together statistical experts from various fields, including representatives from the government statistical agencies of the ""9+2"" cities in the GBA, as well as those from higher education institutions and research institutes from the Chinese Mainland.

Speaking at the opening ceremony of the forum, Mr Yu pointed out that the C&SD has consistently adhered to the guiding principles of ""upholding fundamental principles and breaking new ground; establishing the new before abolishing the old"" on the path of advancing statistical reform and innovation. While upholding the spirit of professionalism in statistics, maintaining objectivity and neutrality, respecting privacy and ensuring data security, he encourages his colleagues to boldly break boundaries, actively embrace new techniques, strive for excellence, and continuously enhance the work cost-effectiveness and service quality.

Mr Yu also remarked that in today's rapidly changing digital era, artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer merely a tool but a powerful force profoundly transforming our ways of working and thinking. In the field of statistics, the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation of massive data are often time-consuming and labour-intensive. AI can efficiently handle repetitive tasks, freeing up the team's energy and time to focus on strategic assessment and innovative applications. Therefore, instead of replacing statistical professionals, AI will become an indispensable ""new member"" of the team, by effectively enhancing the team's ability to process and analyse data.

Senior Statistician of the C&SD Mr Ronald Chan also delivered a presentation entitled ""Strategies for application of data science in official statistics"" at one of the sessions of the forum. The staff members of the C&SD who participated in the forum unanimously expressed that this forum enabled them to acquire insights into the ongoing advancement of statistical techniques on the Chinese Mainland, and reminded them to strive for innovation and actively pursue breakthroughs in the dynamic era of big data, so as to seize opportunities and tackle challenges in the future.

The forum, held online, was attended by representatives of statistical organisations from Beijing, Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and Macao, etc. Relevant officials from the statistical systems of the cities in the GBA, as well as experts and scholars from national think tanks and renowned universities, also shared their valuable insights on topics such as applications of data science techniques, development of statistical talent, statistical reform and innovation, economic monitoring and forecasting, etc."
香港天文台與國家授時中心簽訂協議加強授時合作（附圖）,2025-09-27 13:15,2025-09-27 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092600355.htm,"香港天文台與中國科學院國家授時中心今日（九月二十七日）在天文台總部首次簽署合作協議，加強雙方在時間測量、守時和授時服務方面的合作，以及相關的經驗和技術交流。

合作協議由香港天文台台長陳栢緯博士與國家授時中心主任張首剛博士簽署，並由香港特別行政區環境及生態局局長謝展寰出席見證。

陳栢緯博士在簽署儀式上表示：「香港天文台在一八八三年成立，開台的重點職責之一是提供精準的授時服務，特別是為航海人員。從最初使用中星儀進行天文觀測，到一九二○年代引入的擺鐘、一九六○年代的石英報時系統，再到一九八○年開始採用銫原子鐘，天文台的授時服務隨時代不斷發展。國家授時中心是中國原子時標準的官方守護者，也是星載原子鐘、天地一體化衛星導航授時平台及高精度地基授時系統的開發者，從國家戰略的角度出發，現時是香港天文台與國家授時中心加強緊密合作的好時機。」

張首剛博士說：「國家授時中心是我國唯一的專門、全面從事時間頻率基礎研究和應用研究的科研機構，承擔著我國國家標準時間（北京時間）的產生、保持和授時發播任務。近年來，國家授時中心產生和保持的國家標準時間與協調世界時（UTC）的偏差數值保持在兩納秒以內，準確度達到國際第一，對國際原子時計算的貢獻位列全球第二。國家授時中心與香港天文台長期保持著友好的夥伴關係。此次，我們將進一步深化與香港天文台的合作，通過聯合守時，光纖授時、數據共享等方式，一同提升香港地區的時間服務的準確性和可靠性，共同推動綜合原子時的發展，增強我國時間基準的保持能力。」

簽署儀式前雙方舉行了高層會議，探討在增強授時服務方面的短期和長期合作計劃以及目標成果。天文台將部署運用可靠的設備和方法，從國家授時中心獲取多個時間源，進一步提升本地授時服務的可靠性和堅韌性。除了參與協調世界時的訂定，向位於法國的國際計量局提供原子鐘時間數據外，天文台還計劃加入中國聯綜合原子時系統，共同推動綜合原子時的發展。"
HKO and National Time Service Center sign agreement to strengthen collaboration in time services (with photos),2025-09-27 13:15,2025-09-27 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092600360.htm,"The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and the National Time Service Center (NTSC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences signed the first co-operation agreement at the HKO Headquarters today (September 27) to enhance collaboration in time measurement, time-keeping and time services, as well as the exchange of related experiences and technologies.

 The agreement was signed by the Director of the HKO, Dr Chan Pak-wai, and the Director of the NTSC, Dr Zhang Shougang. The Secretary for Environment and Ecology of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Tse Chin-wan, witnessed the signing ceremony.

 At the signing ceremony, Dr Chan said, ""The HKO was set up in 1883. The provision of an accurate time service, particularly for mariners, has been one of its primary responsibilities since its establishment. From astronomical observations using the transit instrument at the beginning to the introduction of pendulum clocks in the 1920s, quartz-controlled timing systems in the 1960s, and then the adoption of the caesium beam atomic clock commencing in 1980, the Observatory's timing services have continuously developed with the times. Recognising that the NTSC is the official keeper of China's Atomic Time Standard and the developer of spaceborne atomic clocks, the platform for space-ground integrated satellite navigation time service, and the high-precision ground-based time service system, now is an opportune time to strengthen close collaboration between the HKO and the NTSC from a national strategic perspective.""

 Dr Zhang said, ""The NTSC is the only specialised and comprehensive research institute in China dedicated to both the foundational and applied research in time and frequency. We are responsible for generating, maintaining, and disseminating China's National Standard Time (Beijing Time). In recent years, the deviation between the National Standard Time generated and maintained by the NTSC and the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) has remained within two nanoseconds, achieving the highest accuracy internationally. Our contribution to the calculation of the International Atomic Time ranks second globally. The Center maintains a long-standing partnership with the HKO. This time, we will further deepen our co-operation with the Observatory. Through joint timekeeping, fibre-optic time service, data sharing, and other initiatives, we will work together to enhance the accuracy and reliability of time services in Hong Kong, jointly promote the development of integrated atomic time, and further enhance our country's capability to maintain the time standard.""

 Before the signing ceremony, both sides conducted a high-level meeting to discuss the short-term and long-term plans for collaboration in time service enhancement and the target objectives. The Observatory will deploy reliable equipment and methods to acquire multiple time sources from NTSC to further enhance the reliability and resilience of local time service provision. In addition to the continual participation in the determination of UTC by providing atomic clock time data to the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France, the Observatory also plans to participate in the Joint Atomic Time System of China to jointly promote the development of integrated atomic time."
Speech by SHYA at Youth Development Summit (English only),2025-09-27 13:02,2025-09-27 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700408.htm,"âFollowing is the speech by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, at the Youth Development Summit today (September 27):

President Xu (President of All-China Youth Federation, Mr Xu Xiao), Minister Yeoh (the Minister of Youth and Sports, Malaysia, Ms Hannah Yeoh), Deputy Minister AlMajed (the Deputy Minister of Society Development at the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Mr Ahmed Saleh AlMajed), Deputy Minister Keophilavong (the Deputy Secretary General of the Central Committee, Lao People's Revolutionary Youth Union, Mr Souliya Keophilavong), Vice Minister Kochetov (the Vice Minister of Culture and Information, the Republic of Kazakhstan, Mr Yevgeniy Kochetov), Deputy Director-General Qu (the Deputy Director-General, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Dr Qu Xing), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you all to the second edition of the Youth Development Summit, a vibrant gathering that celebrates the boundless potential of our youth under the inspiring theme of ""Connecting the World into the Future"". This theme captures our collective vision of empowering young people to forge connections across cultures and pave the way for a brighter, more interconnected tomorrow together. Last year, we launched this Summit with tremendous energy, with a view to sparking meaningful dialogues and a shared commitment to youth development as the cornerstone of the future of our city, our country and the world. This year, we take the next step together, building on that momentum to foster even deeper connections and opportunities for the next generation.

In this year's Government Work Report at the 14th National People's Congress, Premier Li Qiang called on Hong Kong to deepen international exchanges and co-operation. We embrace that call with concrete actions and plans. For our young people, it means opening doors to new horizons, where they can learn from the world and share Hong Kong's unique story with pride. For our city, it is a chance to cement our role as ""super connector"", bridging talent, ideas and aspirations across cultures and continents.

This very Summit is the embodiment of that spirit of connection and collaboration. We are joined today by distinguished officials, visionary leaders and innovators of different fields from around the globe, alongside youth delegates from diverse backgrounds. Together, you are the proof that when young minds come together, they ignite creativity, foster understanding, and drive innovation that transcends boundaries.

Central to our mission is the Youth Development Blueprint, which was released by my bureau in December 2022. Since its release, we have been taking forward youth development work alongside other policy bureaux, implementing at full steam some 160 measures set out in the Blueprint. Additionally, policy bureaux have introduced around 90 new measures to ensure that the Blueprint progresses with the times and is dynamic and responsive to the changing needs of our youth.

Across the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, bureaux and departments have various measures and initiatives in place to echo Premier Li's call, and I am proud to highlight some of our key initiatives today.

One of our core focuses is opening up the world to our youth through exchange and internship opportunities. In addition to establishing a foothold in Hong Kong, we encourage young people to explore the rich history, culture and opportunities of our country and beyond. Our multi-pronged approach ensures that young people from all walks of life can access these experiences at different stages of their development.

We offer diverse internship opportunities in the Chinese Mainland and overseas, helping young people gain hands-on insights into workplace cultures, set career goals and build networks. Last year, around 5000 young people took part in these programmes, ranging from working as interns inside world-class UNESCO heritage sites of the Palace Museum and Dunhuang Academy, to making meaningful contributions to international affairs through volunteer internships in the overseas field units of various United Nations agencies.

Beyond internships, we also have in place a wide spectrum of exchange programmes, deepening young people's understanding of our country and the world, as well as fostering meaningful exchanges between them and young people around the world. Last year, more than 30000 youth explored various provinces and cities in the Chinese Mainland, as well as 42 countries and regions across five continents. To ensure that grassroots youth would not be denied the opportunity to discover new horizons, we have especially launched a pilot scheme last year to provide additional subsidies for the underprivileged to participate in these exchange activities.

Looking ahead, as newly announced by our Chief Executive Mr John Lee in the 2025 Policy Address last week, we will launch a Young Talent Training Programme to expand opportunities for internships with international organisations and participation in global conferences. We will also introduce a new media thematic internship programme in the Chinese Mainland, which will further equip our youth to tell compelling stories on the global stage.

In addition to going global, we welcome with open arms young people from the Chinese Mainland and all over the world to visit Hong Kong. Last year, some 2800 youth participated in our inbound exchange projects. This year, we have rolled out a number of enhancement measures to further encourage two-way exchange projects, fostering dialogues and friendships between Hong Kong youth and their peers across the Chinese Mainland and globally.

The Youth Development Summit itself is a flagship event for promoting international youth exchange. For today's Summit, I am excited to share that we have gathered about 600 youth delegates from the Chinese Mainland and 33 countries. Aside from the Summit, we are also organising thematic visit programmes for them to explore Hong Kong together with local youth, which will enable them to learn more about Hong Kong's latest development in technological innovation, culture and arts, etc and promote cross-territory youth exchange.

Closer to home, we are creating vibrant spaces to spark creativity and connection. Last year, we unveiled plans to transform the Kai Tak Community Isolation Facility into the ""Youth Post"" hostel, a dynamic place in a beautiful setting near the Victoria Harbour, fostering cultural, arts and sports exchanges. Since its trial launch in July this year, the Youth Post has hosted exciting activities such as skateboarding performances, busking sessions, and concert after-parties tied to Kai Tak Sports Park. Some of the youth delegates joining us at this Summit are actually staying on-site, experiencing its vibrant atmosphere firsthand. With feedback from our youth, we are gearing up for its official opening this year. Over the next five years, the Youth Post plans to host around 100 diverse activities, offering affordable accommodation for youth visitors from the Chinese Mainland and abroad while fostering exchanges that inspire creativity.

Alongside promoting international youth exchange, youth engagement is also at the heart of our youth development efforts. Youth Link, a youth network we launched in September 2023, now connects over 18000 members. It bridges participants from various government youth programmes, offering them the opportunities to develop talents and build trust with the Government. Members have participated in Youth Dialogue sessions with senior government officials and outbound exchange tours, volunteered at major government events, and even attended international events. For example, several Youth Link members represented Hong Kong, China, at the official youth development programme under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) framework held in Peru in November last year, engaging in meaningful exchanges with peers across the region.

We are also expanding physical spaces for youth engagement. Youth Square, located in Chai Wan as a dedicated hub for youth development, provides a vibrant venue for young people to connect and learn through events and activities. By year-end, its first phase of renovations will unveil a new interactive space and video studio. Coupled with the ""Good Stories of Hong Kong Youth"" Programme, young people will create videos to share inspiring stories about Hong Kong, supported by training in production and filming. Similarly, in the dynamic district of Sham Shui Po, known for its rich cultural heritage and bustling creative energy, the renovations at the Nam Cheong District Community Centre and the adjacent Tung Chau Street Temporary Market will provide a lively hub for Youth Link members to connect and grow their networks. The first phase of the renovation works will be completed by the end of this year.

While our bureau spearheads many youth development initiatives, we work hand in hand with all bureaux to advance this shared mission. For example, the Education Bureau plays a vital role in broadening global horizons for students. Since the 2016/17 academic year, the Belt and Road Scholarship has encouraged outstanding students from 49 Belt and Road countries to pursue publicly-funded undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in Hong Kong. Over 680 students have been awarded the scholarship to date. We are thrilled to have over 70 of these awardees with us at the Summit this morning, bringing diverse insights to our discussions. The Scheme for Subsidy on Exchange for Post-secondary Students, introduced in 2015 and later expanded to Belt and Road regions in 2016 and 2019, aids students in participating in international exchanges, internships, service programmes, and competitions, with 35 institutions participated in 2024/25. Furthermore, life-wide learning strategies, supported by a flexible curriculum and grants such as the Life-wide Learning and Sister School Grant and the Student Activities Support Grant, enable students from all backgrounds to engage in STEAM competitions and study tours outside ordinary classroom settings, cultivating informed and responsible global citizens.

Ladies and gentlemen, our young people are stepping into a world that is more interconnected yet more challenging than ever. Through these initiatives, we are equipping them not just to navigate this changing landscape but to shape it with confidence and purpose.

We remain steadfast in our commitment to the Youth Development Blueprint, scaling up partnerships and opportunities to make international exchange a transformative experience for the next generation. With the unique positioning of Hong Kong, anchored in our country and open to the world, we are determined to be the ""super connector"" our youth need. I invite you all to join us in this mission. Together, we can unlock endless possibilities for our young people and, in doing so, for our shared global future. Thank you."

尊敬的施子清博士、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！很高興出席今天的「九十禮讚翰墨華章——施子清博士書法回顧展」，與大家一同欣賞施博士數十年來用心鑽研的書法造詣，感受中華傳統文化藝術的韻味和生命力。很多謝司儀剛剛很詳細介紹了施博士早年來到香港一直到現在如何為藝術、如何為香港作出巨大的貢獻，介紹得很詳細，而且不用看稿。

施子清博士自幼熱愛書法藝術，數十年來從未停筆，他的作品先後於北京、上海、香港、澳門、廈門等地展出，並獲得中國國家博物館收藏，可見施博士於書法界的崇高地位。

所謂「獨樂樂，不如眾樂樂」，多年來施博士帶領中國書協香港分會，致力於書法藝術的推廣和傳承，他親自編寫的《書法學習教程》，成功讓書法藝術走進年輕人和普羅市民的視野，發揮藝術薰陶人心的文明價值。我要衷心感謝施博士以及中國書協一直以來的努力和熱誠。

這次書法回顧展適逢施博士九十大壽，展出120件佳作，不但展示了書法藝術的技法，更呈現中華文明的精神與面貌。我知道，今次展覽是施博士與香港故宮文化博物館的再次合作，藉着香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心的獨特地位，將書法這種中華文化獨有的藝術推廣開去，讓更多人能在欣賞書法作品的同時，加深認識中華文化源遠流長的歷史和思想內涵，細閱以筆墨書寫的中國好故事。

「文化藝術」是香港未來發展其中一個關鍵詞。香港在「一國兩制」下擁有的內聯外通優勢，不但成就香港成為連接國家與國際間經貿合作的雙向平台角色，更是促使中外文明交流的重要平台。

隨着內地和香港的文化交流日益緊密，我們將積極發揮香港中外文化匯聚的特色，讓中華文化從香港出發，走進國際舞台，提升中華文化的軟實力。

去年公布的《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，為香港文化藝術與創意產業的長遠發展指明方向。我們會舉辦及支持更多大型、多元的文化藝術活動和合作，為中外文化藝術交流搭建平台，推動中華優秀傳統文化的傳承與弘揚。

書法是中華文化的重要載體，承載着民族精神，也凝聚着文化自信。本屆政府全力推展愛國主義教育，在社會厚植愛國情懷，而文化自信和自豪感，正正是凝聚我們齊心貢獻國家，建設香港的精神命脈和力量泉源。

最後，我祝願這次巡迴展覽圓滿成功，期望大家從施博士的墨寶中，細味書法藝術的魅力，並透過筆墨之道，打開探索中華璀璨文化寶藏的大門。多謝大家。"

這次書法回顧展適逢施博士九十大壽，展出120件佳作，不但展示了書法藝術的技法，更呈現中華文明的精神與面貌。我知道，今次展覽是施博士與香港故宮文化博物館的再次合作，藉着香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心的獨特地位，將書法這種中華文化獨有的藝術推廣開去，讓更多人能在欣賞書法作品的同時，加深認識中華文化源遠流長的歷史和思想內涵，細閱以筆墨書寫的中國好故事。

「文化藝術」是香港未來發展其中一個關鍵詞。香港在「一國兩制」下擁有的內聯外通優勢，不但成就香港成為連接國家與國際間經貿合作的雙向平台角色，更是促使中外文明交流的重要平台。

隨着內地和香港的文化交流日益緊密，我們將積極發揮香港中外文化匯聚的特色，讓中華文化從香港出發，走進國際舞台，提升中華文化的軟實力。

去年公布的《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，為香港文化藝術與創意產業的長遠發展指明方向。我們會舉辦及支持更多大型、多元的文化藝術活動和合作，為中外文化藝術交流搭建平台，推動中華優秀傳統文化的傳承與弘揚。

書法是中華文化的重要載體，承載着民族精神，也凝聚着文化自信。本屆政府全力推展愛國主義教育，在社會厚植愛國情懷，而文化自信和自豪感，正正是凝聚我們齊心貢獻國家，建設香港的精神命脈和力量泉源。

最後，我祝願這次巡迴展覽圓滿成功，期望大家從施博士的墨寶中，細味書法藝術的魅力，並透過筆墨之道，打開探索中華璀璨文化寶藏的大門。多謝大家。"

Remarks by SLW at media session (English only),2025-09-27 11:18,2025-09-27 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700329.htm,"Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, at a media session after attending a radio program this morning (September 27):

Reporter: In the Policy Address, it says that six more Community Living Rooms (CLRs) will be set up in Hong Kong. Could you reveal when will the public could see these newly set up CLRs and when would the first one be opened according to the Government's timelines? And as for thosewhich have been in operation since 2023, does the Government intend to keep them running after the three-year program when it comes to an end?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. Right now we have nine CLRs in operation. In the Policy Address, the Chief Executive announced six more will be coming. So our plans for the coming year or so, at least six CLRs will be opened.

In terms of district, we believe we should be able to see CLRs in operation, say in the Yau Tsim Mong District, and also in Tsuen Wan and Kwai Ching. These are the areas we don't have any CLR right now. As for the existing CLRs, I think the concern is over the four CLRs that have been in operation for more than a year. In fact, for the first one in Shum Shui Po, it has been in operation more than one and a half year, so given the first agreement was that they would be provided free of charge for three years, it's inevitable that we are thinking about the renewal. We are grateful to the donors of these four CLRs, i.e. the Sino Group, the Henderson Land Group, and also the China Resources Group. They are going to provide another three years of extension of their leases. That means for these four CLRs will be provided to us free of charge together with the renovation cost for six years.

Reporter: So earlier in July, the Government has launched a pilot scheme in helping to identify families at risk. For example, when a caregiver has admitted to the hospital, the Hospital Authority (HA) would pass a message to the Social Welfare Department (SWD) who will reach out to the elderly in need. Would you also give us an update given that the program has been running for about two months now?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. Indeed, starting from mid-July this year, we are finally be able to make use of the big data available in the SWD, in the HA, and also in the Housing Department (HD). We are launching two pilots at the same time. The first one is through a data matching between the HA and the SWD. We started with around 10 000 people who were in receipt of the carer allowance schemes. Right now, we have received more than 500 alerts from the HA about the hospital admission of the carers. But only two cases require urgent support, including delivery of meal to their homes and also respite services.

Turning to another pilot we have been conducting right now is a data matching process to find out the singleton or doubleton elderly households held by the HD. We have been visiting more than 5 000 households, and out of these 5 000 households, around 400 are considered to be in need of further support. We have referred them to the relevant welfare associations and organisations to provide support and services later on."

Distinguished guests and government officials from around the world, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning, everyone! A heartfelt welcome to Hong Kong and this second edition of the Youth Development Summit.

  I spoke at last year's inaugural edition of the Summit and was delighted with the great turnout – innovators and change-makers taking part from all over the world.

  Well, this year's Summit, I'm happy to say, is even bigger, counting more than 3 000 young leaders. You're here from Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland, from East and Central Asia, the Middle East and beyond.

  And your presence here today is a testament to the growing eagerness of young people, worldwide, to come together and learn from one another, creating prospects for a more connected and prosperous global community. And this year's theme, ""Connecting the World into the Future,"" reflects that encouraging reality.

  Your participation highlights our shared commitment to promoting youth development – in Hong Kong, across the Belt and Road regions and around the world.

  The Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government attaches great importance to youth. Our Youth Development Blueprint, released in late 2022, outlines our guiding principles for advancing youth development, as well as charting a clear pathway for stakeholders everywhere.

  Our vision is to nurture a new generation of youth equipped with a global perspective, a positive thinking mindset and an affection for our city and our country.

  Since the release of the Blueprint, more than 250 concrete actions and measures have been put forward, providing young people with wide-ranging opportunities and support.

  And just 10 days ago, the Chief Executive delivered his annual Policy Address. It includes a number of measures to promote youth development. Among them, a Young Talent Training Programme will expand opportunities for our youth to attend conferences and take part in the internships of international organisations.

  There will also be a new media thematic internship programme on the Mainland, a strengthened Youth Financial Education Programme, and new professional mediation workshops to help broaden young people's international perspectives and cultivate a global mindset.

  Exchange programmes for youth will also be stepped up, encouraging young people from overseas and the mainland to visit Hong Kong on exchange. Our Youth Post hostel, open now on a trial basis, officially opens later this year, providing affordable accommodation for young people, as well as a wide range of youth-focused activities and events. The goal is to encourage exchanges between Hong Kong youth and young visitors from around the world.

  This Summit is among the Youth Development Blueprint's initiatives. It brings together 20 prominent speakers, including young entrepreneurs, athletes, business professionals from I&T (Innovation and Technology) and the creative and service industries, and government and institutional leaders. I know their passion, experience and innovative insights will inspire us all.

  To you, our youth participants, this Summit is your Summit, yours to offer, and learn about, innovative solutions, create global connections and expand your horizons.

  The future belongs to you, and by taking part in today's Summit, you are one step closer to turning your ideas into tangible realities.

  Sports, and sportsmanship, is an integral element of youth – and this Summit. Sportsmanship encourages respect, fairness, integrity and teamwork.

  The 15th National Games will be held November 9 to 21, with Hong Kong hosting the Games together with Guangdong and Macao. Hong Kong will stage eight events: basketball, beach volleyball, fencing, golf, handball, rugby sevens, track cycling and triathlon.

  I invite you all to join us, in November, for this world-class sports competition, the many cultural events accompanying it and all the excitement of Hong Kong, Asia's world city.

  I am grateful to this year's Summit speakers, and to all of you, here in Hong Kong contribute your time, energy and ideas to create a better, more connected, world. Let us remember that lasting connectivity demands more than technology or infrastructure alone can offer. Empathy, understanding and a shared purpose, are no less essential.

  I am confident that, working together, we can empower a generation that is resilient, resourceful and ready to build a bright future for all.

  I wish all a rewarding Summit and an enjoyable stay in Hong Kong, the world's East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange.

  Thank you very much."

Dr Tony Wong (Chairman of the Hong Kong Comics and Animation Federation), Mr Kim Dong-hwa (renowned Korean comics artist), esteemed comics artists from Hong Kong and Korea, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Annyeonghaseyo (Korean: Hello). Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you for the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong Comics and Culture Exhibition. Today, we gather to unleash the unlimited potential of comic creations with our Korean friends and to strengthen the amicable ties between the cultural and creative industries of Hong Kong and Korea.

Comics are more than just a form of entertainment; they are a vibrant art form that captures our way of life, echoes our collective memories, and expresses our unique cultural identities. By showcasing the works of 19 Hong Kong comic artists across generations, alongside two internationally-acclaimed Korean comic artists, this exhibition initiates a powerful creative dialogue. It offers us all a wonderful opportunity to understand each other's lives and cultures more deeply.

Some of you may already be familiar with our classic, iconic characters like ""Old Master Q"" (èå¤«å­) and ""My Boy"" (çä»), who have won the hearts of generations around the globe. Today, we have brought a diverse collection of these and many more characters to meet our Korean friends. Our exhibits include exciting crossovers between contemporary comics, film, television, games, and art toys. I encourage you all to take your time to explore and enjoy the authentic humour and satirical wit of Hong Kong comics.

This exhibition is made possible with the support of my Bureau's Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency and the tremendous efforts of the Hong Kong Comics and Animation Federation. The Federation's work is vital to our industry's growth. For instance, through its Hong Kong Comics Support Programme launched in 2021, we have nurtured new talents and publishing enterprises. This initiative has already led to the publication of 63 original comics and secured over 30 licensing agreements for foreign-language editions. This is a testament to the global appeal and competitiveness of Hong Kong, as it effectively expands their reach into overseas markets. Here today, you will see artworks from six of the award-winning artists of the Programme.

This exhibition is also a highlight of the Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul, which officially began last night. The week features 14 curated programmes with around 65 performances and activities. I sincerely hope that you will join us for these events and enjoy the array of arts and culture we have brought from Hong Kong to Korea.

In closing, I would like to congratulate the Hong Kong Comics and Animation Federation and all the talented comic artists from Hong Kong and Korea for making this exceptional exhibition a reality.

I wish the Hong Kong Comics and Culture Exhibition a resounding success and look forward to more fruitful collaborations between Hong Kong and Korea in the years to come.

VSB enhances regulatory measures for registered veterinary surgeons,2025-09-27 10:37,2025-09-27 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092601131.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Veterinary Surgeons Board of Hong Kong:

The Veterinary Surgeons Board of Hong Kong (VSB) announced a series of measures to enhance the regulation of the veterinary practice of the registered veterinary surgeons (RVSs) and veterinary services in Hong Kong today (September 27).

The VSB has been closely monitoring public opinions in enhancing veterinary services. As the statutory body responsible for the regulation, registration, and disciplinary control of professional activities of RVSs, the VSB is committed to ensuring that veterinary services in Hong Kong are maintained at a high standard. After carefully gauging stakeholders' views, referencing practices from other regions, and balancing the needs of all parties, the VSB has introduced the following specific measures:

(1) Increasing the transparency of veterinary profession and enhancing the disciplinary inquiry arrangement


Extending publication periods of disciplinary orders: The VSB has extended the periods of publication of disciplinary orders made after March 26, 2025. The publication period for orders involving removal of names from the register of RVSs has been extended from one year to three years; and that for other orders, from one year to two years (both with the RVSs' names published). As regards publication of orders in an anonymised manner for educational purposes, the period has been extended from three years to indefinitely;




Providing guidance for disciplinary inquiries: A set of Inquiry Committee Guidance Manual has been compiled for reference by inquiry committees when adjudicating disciplinary inquiries against RVSs;




Mandating display of veterinarians' full names at clinics and name identification in medical records: RVSs (including locum RVSs) must display their full names prominently at the entrances or within the waiting areas of the clinics at which they practise. Additionally, the treating RVSs should be identified by name in the medical records of all consultations and procedures; and




Enhancing the reporting requirements for practising addresses: RVSs (including locum RVSs) are required to report their current regular or most regular practising addresses, enabling public access to current addresses at which RVSs primarily practise.


(2) Strengthening the regulation of the profession and public education


Introducing requirements on the use of complementary/alternative treatments and substances: RVSs must ensure that the use of complementary or alternative treatments and substances is in the animals' best interest and would yield equal or better results than the sole use of the available conventional treatments or medications for the condition concerned;




Introducing requirements on governing the use of telemedicine in veterinary practice: No veterinary service shall be provided using remote means of communication, unless the veterinary surgeon has conducted a physical examination of the animal within the preceding six months that reasonably suffices to enable the veterinary service to be provided without a further physical examination of the animal;




Suggested items in seeking clients' consent: A suggested items checklist was published for reference of the veterinary profession in seeking clients' consent in treatment and care of animals; and




Enhancing publicity of the types of veterinary service: Enhancing public education and publicity to help animal owners distinguish between general and specialised veterinary practices, enabling them to make informed choices about the services they need.


(3) Increasing understanding of the current situation and need for regulating the veterinary nursing profession


Survey on the veterinary nursing profession in Hong Kong: The VSB has launched a survey on the veterinary nursing professionin August this year, aiming to gather demographic information from RVSs, veterinary nursing practitioners (such as veterinary nurses, veterinary assistants, and veterinary technicians), as well as clinic owners. Information collected includes the number of practitioners engaged in veterinary nursing, their qualifications, areas of work, and their perspectives on regulation of the veterinary nursing profession.Based on analysis of the survey findings and with reference to the situations of the profession in Hong Kong and abroad, the VSB will explore the feasibility of establishing a regulatory framework for veterinary nursing practitioners.


Part of the above measures involve amendments to the Code of Practice for the Guidance of Registered Veterinary Surgeons and the Rules of the Veterinary Surgeons Board (Registration of Veterinary Surgeons). The VSB notified RVSs of the amendments in late August this year. The amendments will take effect from September 29, 2025 and will be available on the VSB's website (www.vsbhk.org.hk/english/rules/relevant.html). RVSs should read through and acquaint themselves thoroughly with the amendments thereby avoiding the danger of inadvertently transgressing accepted codes of professional ethical behaviour which may lead to disciplinary actions.

The VSB will continue to listen to views from various sectors of the community; and safeguard the health and welfare of animals and interests of animal owners, through the development and improvement of professional standards and registration of veterinary surgeons."
SFST gets better grasp of needs of companies go global in Poland (with photos),2025-09-27 10:00,2025-09-27 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092601192.htm,"  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, visited the Warsaw Stock Exchange and met with Polish officials and members of the business sector in Warsaw, Poland before concluding his visit to the country. He also visited a Mainland enterprise which has set up factory facilities in Tychy, Poland, to learn about the needs of the go global companies.

  On September 25 (Warsaw time), Mr Hui visited the Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW) and met with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr Tomasz BardziÅowski, as well as other management members. The GPW was founded by the Polish State Treasury and is a major financial instrument exchange in Central and Eastern Europe.

 During the meeting, Mr Hui introduced to them the strong momentum of Hong Kong's stock market which has an average daily turnover for the first eight months of 2025 of EUR 27 billion, and the policy support behind the success. He said the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is committed to strengthening the breadth and depth of the listing platform and securities market. New initiatives were just announced by the Chief Executive in his 2025 Policy Address aiming to continuously strengthen the stock market, including further optimising the regimes for listing on the Main Board and issuing structured products, as well as encouraging more overseas enterprises to seek secondary listings in Hong Kong. The GPW considers the Mainland and Hong Kong to be growth engines for economy nowadays. Mr Hui anticipated more connections could be established with the GPW to increase the diversity of both stock markets, including real-world asset tokenisation which the GPW is interested in.

 Later at a meeting with the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology of Poland, Mr MichaÅ Baranowski, Mr Hui introduced to him the stellar performance of Hong Kong in wealth management and its equity market, as well as new initiatives aiming to drive financial development, such as building an international gold trading market which will comprise a Government-led central clearing system for gold.

 He then met with the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance (MoF) of Poland, Mr JarosÅaw Neneman; the Director of the International Tax Policy Department in the MoFof Poland, Mr Cezary Krysiak; and the Director of the International Cooperation Department in the MoFof Poland, Mr PaweÅ Siwek, to request the removal of Hong Kong from Poland's ""list of jurisdictions with harmful tax practice"" (the List). Mr Hui highlighted that Hong Kong had been fully supporting international efforts in enhancing tax transparency and combating tax evasion and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had not identified any harmful tax regimes in Hong Kong.

 Noting that Hong Kong had been rated by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes as largely compliant in the international standards on exchange of information on request and is also not on the European Union’s watchlist on tax co-operation, the Polish MoF, taking into account all the circumstances, will positively consider removing Hong Kong from the List.

 Mr Hui also proposed to start negotiations on a Comprehensive Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement (CDTA) between Hong Kong and Poland as soon as practicable. Both sides see that a CDTA could be conducive to bilateral trade activities, bringing substantial mutual benefits.

  In the afternoon, Mr Hui had a meeting with the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr Wojciech ZajÄczkowski. Mr Hui told him that Hong Kong has maintained its ranking of third place globally, with the rating gaps with first place (New York) and second place (London) narrowed to two points and one point respectively in the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) 38 Report published on the same day. Hong Kong leaped to first place in the world in fintech offerings, and the rankings in the areas of ""business environment"", ""infrastructure"", and ""reputational and general"" also rose to first globally. With the gateway roles of Poland and Hong Kong in their respective regions, the two places can co-operate in various areas to facilitate Mainland enterprises to enter the European market, and European enterprises can access the Asian and Chinese markets through Hong Kong.

  Mr Hui also joined a business luncheon organised by the China Construction Bank to meet with management of various renowned Mainland enterprises which have set up a presence in Europe. He assured them that Hong Kong is determined to position itself as a platform for ""bringing in and going global"" to support Mainland enterprises in seeking overseas expansion. He noted that aside from world-class professional services and its robust financial regime, Hong Kong has much more to offer to assist enterprises to expand further.

  On the same day, Mr Hui also met with the Minister Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in Poland, Ms Li Danhong, to update her on the financial landscape in Hong Kong.

  Before concluding his visit to Poland on September 26 (Tychy time), Mr Hui went for a visit to the Sanhua AWECO Polish Appliance to meet with their management team and tour its Tychy plant which is the largest among the three key manufacturing facilities of the company across Europe.

  At a meeting with the General Manager and Chief Financial Officer of the Sanhua EMEA Shared Management Platform of Sanhua Group, Mr Yao Bing, and the Chief Executive Officer of Sanhua Aweco EMEA, Mr Liu Shifeng, Mr Hui elaborated to them on the various initiatives Hong Kong will launch and the professional services available to assist Mainland companies to go global through Hong Kong. He also had a deep discussion with them to learn more about the challenges that Mainland companies have encountered during their journey of overseas expansion.

 Mr Hui will return to Hong Kong on September 27."
財經事務及庫務局局長在波蘭深入了解「出海」企業需要（附圖）,2025-09-27 10:00,2025-09-27 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092601183.htm,"財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇在結束波蘭訪問前，到訪華沙證券交易所，並與波蘭官員和商界人士會面。他也參觀了一家在波蘭蒂黑設廠的內地企業，了解「出海」企業的需要。

許正宇九月二十五日（華沙時間）到訪華沙證券交易所，與行政總裁Tomasz Bardziłowski及其他管理層會面。華沙證券交易所由波蘭財政部創立，是中歐和東歐地區的主要金融產品交易所。

會面期間，許正宇向他們介紹了香港股市強勁的發展勢頭，包括今年首八個月的每日平均成交額達270億歐元，以及背後的政策支持。他表示，香港特別行政區政府致力於加強上市平台和證券市場的廣度和深度。行政長官在剛發表的二○二五年《施政報告》中宣布一系列旨在持續強化股票市場的新舉措，包括進一步完善主板上市和結構性產品發行機制，以及推動更多海外企業來港第二上市。華沙證券交易所認為內地與香港是現今經濟的增長引擎，許正宇期待與華沙證券交易所建立更多聯繫，令兩地股票市場更多元化，包括華沙證券所有興趣的現實世界資產代幣化。

隨後，許正宇與波蘭經濟發展及科技部副部長Michał Baranowski會面，向他介紹香港在財富管理和股票巿場的亮麗表現，以及各項推動金融增長的新措施，包括建立國際黃金交易巿場，當中涵蓋由政府牽頭的香港黃金中央清算系統。

他其後與波蘭財政部副部長Jarosław Neneman、國際稅務政策署署長Cezary Krysiak和國際合作署署長Paweł Siwek會面，要求將香港從波蘭的「採用損害性稅務措施的稅務管轄區名單」（名單）中剔除。許正宇強調，香港一直全力支持國際社會提升稅務透明度和打擊逃稅的工作，而經濟合作與發展組織亦沒有發現香港有任何損害性稅務措施。

波蘭財政部注意到在按請求交換資料方面，香港已獲稅務透明化及有效交換資料全球論壇評定為大致符合國際標準，而香港也不在歐洲聯盟的稅務合作事宜觀察名單上。在考慮各項相關因素後，波蘭財政部會積極考慮將香港從名單中剔除。

許正宇亦建議波蘭與香港早日就全面性避免雙重課稅協定（全面性協定）啓動磋商。雙方均認同兩地簽訂全面性協定對促進雙邊貿易大有裨益，實屬互惠互利。

下午，許正宇與波蘭外交部副部長Wojciech Zajączkowski會面，並向他提到在同日發布的第38期《全球金融中心指數》報告中香港穩居第三位，整體評分與位列第一的紐約和第二的倫敦的分數差距，分別收窄至2分和1分。在金融科技水平方面，香港躍升至第一位，而「營商環境」、「基礎設施」及「聲譽及綜合」方面也同樣升至全球第一。波蘭和香港在各自地區扮演門戶角色，兩地可以在多個領域合作，促進內地企業進入歐洲巿場，以及歐洲企業透過香港進入亞洲和中國巿場。

許正宇也出席了由中國建設銀行舉辦的商務午餐會，與已在歐洲開展業務的多家知名內地企業管理層會面。許正宇向他們保證，香港致力於成為「引進來、走出去」的平台，支持內地企業拓展海外業務。他指出，除了世界級的專業服務和完善的金融體系外，香港還有多方面的優勢可協助企業進一步拓展業務。

同日，許正宇也拜訪了中國駐波蘭大使館公使參贊李丹鴻，向她介紹香港金融環境的最新狀況。

許正宇九月二十六日（蒂黑時間）結束波蘭之行前，造訪了三花亞威科波蘭電器設備有限公司，與該公司的管理團隊會面，並參觀了該公司位於蒂黑的廠房。蒂黑廠房是該公司在歐洲三大主要生產基地中規模最大的。

在與三花集團三花歐洲平台總經理及財務中心總監姚彬和三花亞威科歐洲行政總裁劉世峰會面時，許正宇向他們詳細介紹了香港為協助內地企業通過香港「出海」而即將推出的各項舉措，以及現有的專業服務。他亦與三花管理層深入交流，以了解內地企業在拓展海外業務過程中所遇到的挑戰。

許正宇將於九月二十七日返抵香港。"
環境及生態局局長在立法會食物安全及環境衞生事務委員會政策簡報會就《行政長官2025年施政報告》相關措施開場發言（只有中文）,2025-09-27 09:36,2025-09-27 09:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700258.htm,"以下是環境及生態局局長謝展寰今日（九月二十七日）上午在立法會食物安全及環境衞生事務委員會政策簡報會就《行政長官2025年施政報告》相關政策措施的開場發言：

主席、各位委員：

相信大家都已經閱讀了文件，所以我只簡單介紹《行政長官2025年施政報告》中有關環境及生態局食物科的措施，讓大家多點時間討論。

推廣寵物友善

推廣寵物友善方面，香港有不少住户飼養寵物，衍生龐大消費需求。食環署（食物環境衞生署）會讓食肆申請容許狗隻進入，而獲批食肆也會有明確標識。食環署會就執行細節諮詢業界，以期在二○二六年年中批出首輪申請，屆時市民和業界將有更多選擇，我們亦希望為餐飲業帶來新商機。

我們會持續優化進口貓狗的檢疫安排，亦鼓勵業界提升寵物相關服務的水平。在加強管理獸醫服務方面，漁護署（漁農自然護理署）一直跟香港獸醫管理局探討各項優化措施，包括延長在管理局網站刊登紀律制裁命令的時間等，關於這些優化措施，管理局今日稍後便會作公布。

支援業界發展

支援業界方面，今年的施政報告有不少措施支援中小企。其中，小販、食物業、漁農業、酒牌的牌照及許可證費用會豁免一年，預計逾六萬個持牌人受惠。

今年第四季開始，食環署將會統籌相關部門採用新的「會審」機制，以精簡的程序加快審批食肆露天座位申請；簡單直接的個案我們估計大約一個月就能完成。

政府會積極協助「香港食品」銷售到內地，並預留香園圍口岸一帶土地，推動食品產業發展，包括食品批發、加工和交易，長遠發展為具特色的食品產業園，希望推廣「食品製造＋旅遊」的概念。

我們並會繼續推動經濟多元發展。我們會持續推展《漁農業可持續發展藍圖》下的措施。明年年中更會為本地漁農產品建立統一新品牌，提高產品辨識度和品牌價值。

環境衞生

此外，我們會繼續改善環境衞生的工作，包括推出優化處理樓宇滲水問題的檢測程序，加快要求業主履行妥善保養物業的責任；同時大力推動以協商和調解方式解決滲水糾紛。

我的簡介到此，希望大家繼續支持我們的工作。我和同事樂意回應大家的提問。"
天氣酷熱　衞生署提醒市民預防高溫引發的疾病,2025-09-27 09:17,2025-09-27 09:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700247.htm,"天氣酷熱，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月二十七日）提醒市民，應採取適當措施預防高溫引發的疾病，例如熱痙攣、熱衰竭和中暑。

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-27 09:17,2025-09-27 09:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700251.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 27) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

Opening remarks by STL at Routes World 2025 Host Party (English only) (with photo),2025-09-26 22:12,2025-09-26 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092601127.htm,"Following are the opening remarks by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the Routes World 2025 Host Party today (September 26):

Chairman Peter (Chairman of the Hong Kong Tourism Board, Dr Peter Lam), Chairman Fred (Chairman of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mr Fred Lam), Steven (Managing Director of Routes, Mr Steven Small), Michael (Executive Vice President - Commercial Development of Informa Markets, Mr Michael Duck), Vivian (Chief Executive Officer of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mrs Vivian Cheung), ladies and gentlemen,

Welcome you all to Hong Kong! I am so glad that we are able to change the welcoming reception to a farewell reception. Otherwise, I will not be able to see all of you and participate in this memorable event. Thank you again, Vivian.

I think most of you have had a very enjoyable stay in Hong Kong, despite some disruption brought by the super typhoon. But on the other hand, I am sure you have had a taste of our famous subtropical cyclone. You can also get a glimpse of the city's super efficiency and resilience in getting back to normal, including our beloved International Airport. I can share with you a few tips on how we can get back to normal after a severe typhoon.

With advanced preparations and the concerted efforts of different Government departments and the Airport Authority Hong Kong, we made different precautionary measures and advanced preparations. As far as the airport is concerned, we had devised a lot of contingency plans to ensure a sustainable and continual operation of the International Airport. Although we had to make a few adjustments to the incoming and outgoing flights, passenger safety is of utmost importance. On the other hand, for this round of severe weather, Vivian and her team had put in little gimmicks like dishing out some popcorns; candies; some goodies including blankets, water, to let our passengers, who might have to stay in the airport for a little while, feel the warmth and comfort that Hong Kong gives them.

Back to the Routes World 2025 today, which is the theme of this event, I am very thankful for the adaptiveness and also efficiency in making all sorts of adjustments to the arrangements, making the event a great success. With such a large crowd of guests and participants standing in front of me today, it reminds me of a part of our Chinese history. A great Chinese Admiral Zheng He (é­å), who was well-known of his voyage, travelled to the modern-day Kenya, transforming all his routes into a vast network expansion which also facilitated the exchange of ideas. In many ways, I think all of you are making history today like he did. You are connecting and the event has brought together more than 2 500 participants from all over the world in renowned aviation industry to Hong Kong.

I know that over the past two days, there have been more than 9 000 meetings going round throughout the event, mapping out some new routes, fostering new friendships and new partnerships with different partners around the globe. In a way, we are making history, and we are shaping a new future for not only our skies, we also shape a new future for our economies and communities. Hong Kong is very ready and has prepared to welcome international conferences and events like Routes World. In fact, we look forward to having more of this kind of events in Hong Kong, to showcase our role as a world-class hub, not only for aviation, but also for innovation, idea exchange and collaboration.

Looking ahead, I would like to announce two things in which we can create new growth for aviation development in Hong Kong. First of all, the Hong Kong Government will lead the Airport Authority in developing negotiations and discussions with our major aviation partners, to bring together some new air services agreements. On the other hand, I know that the Airport Authority, with Fred and Vivian's leadership, has been putting in place a very visionary and energetic outreach team to discuss different business potentials for new airlines coming to Hong Kong. Secondly, I would like to tell you that today the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government has just announced the creation and establishment of a new advisory committee, the Advisory Committee on Development of International Aviation Superhub. With this terminology, you can see the importance Hong Kong Government is attaching to develop Hong Kong into not just a normal aviation hub, but an international aviation superhub. With all of you here today assembling, I hope that we can work together to establish new alliance, to foster new relationships and overcome the various challenges posed by the changes in the global landscape, supply chain disruptions or airspace restrictions.

Apart from all this business routine, I would like to appeal to you to take a bit of your time this evening, and take a look at the environment surrounding you today. We are here in this magnificent M+ venue, where history and modernity converge. I am very grateful for the organiser, Informa Markets and also the Airport Authority Hong Kong, for making this event so memorable, and making this farewell event happened. Please don't forget to take your time to look at the magnificent Hong Kong skyline, in which the sky tonight is extremely clear, perhaps because the severe storm has just passed. No matter what storms are ahead of us, we will eventually see a clear blue sky. Thank you very much for attending this farewell event, and I hope you are having an enjoyable evening. Once again, welcome you all to Hong Kong!"

The DSD immediately suspended the use of the damaged sewage main and diverted sewage to the emergency sewage treatment facilities at the Repulse Bay Main Sewage Pumping Station, where the sewage undergoes chemically enhanced settlement and disinfection before discharging into the sea. The DSD is currently carrying out emergency repair works and anticipates the works to be completed by this Sunday. The repaired sewage main will then resume service.

Moreover, the DSD has been collecting sea water samples for testing from Deep Water Bay Beach and Repulse Bay Beach since yesterday and will continue so daily after works completion, and will publish daily the test results on its website (www.dsd.gov.hk/EN/What_s_New/What_s_New/news31011.html), thereby allowing public access to the latest information. The DSD has reported to the Environmental and Ecology Bureau the incident yesterday, and will continue to closely monitor the water quality of the concerned beaches together with the Environmental Protection Department.

Due to the necessary inspection and clearance works of damage and miscellaneous articles caused by Super Typhoon Ragasa, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) announced that some gazetted beaches nearby (including Deep Water Bay Beach and Repulse Bay Beach) were temporarily closed. Members of the public are advised not to swim at Deep Water Bay Beach and Repulse Bay Beach or the nearby waters to safeguard their health. The DSD will continue to closely liaise with the LCSD.

The DSD commenced the construction and rehabilitation of sewage rising mains in Southern District in January this year, so as to construct about 8.8 kilometres of sewage rising mains connecting the Repulse Bay Main Sewage Pumping Station, to the sewerage system at Ap Lei Chau Bridge Road, including the construction of about 1.5 km subsea twin pressurised sewer to replace the above concerned pressurised sewage main, to enhance the overall stability of the sewage system."

署方已即時停用有關污水管，並將污水引流至淺水灣總污水泵房旁的現有緊急應變污水處理設施，經過化學強化沉澱及消毒處理程序後，才排放出大海。署方現正為受損污水管進行緊急修復工程，預計於本週日完成，屆時經修復的污水管亦會重新投入使用。

此外，署方已從昨日起直至修復工程完成之後，每日於深水灣泳灘及淺水灣泳灘抽取海水樣本進行水質化驗，並會透過渠務署網頁（www.dsd.gov.hk/TC/What_s_New/What_s_New/news31011.html）發布有關化驗結果，讓公眾查閱。署方已於昨日通報環境及生態局，並會繼續聯同環境保護署密切監測相關泳灘水質。

由於需要檢視及處理超強颱風「樺加沙」引致的破壞及清理雜物，康樂及文化事務署（康文署）已暫停開放附近刊憲泳灘（包括深水灣泳灘及淺水灣泳灘）。為保障健康，公眾人士請勿在深水灣泳灘及淺水灣泳灘或附近海域游泳。署方會繼續與康文署保持緊密聯繫。

署方已於今年一月展開南區污水泵喉建造及修復工程，以建造約8.8公里長的污水泵喉連接淺水灣總污水泵房至鴨脷洲橋道的污水收集系統，當中包括建造約1.5公里長的海底雙管加壓管道取代涉事的加壓污水管，以加強有關地區污水收集系統的穩定性。"

​​鮮活快線是由粵港兩地政府共同推出，旨在充分利用香港國際機場和港珠澳大橋的優勢，以創新監管模式，簡化鮮活食品的清關流程，便利外地的鮮活食品經香港「引進來」內地消費市場，同時亦助力內地優質的鮮活食品「走出去」海外巿場，發揮香港作為「超級聯繫人」及「超級增值人」的作用，以促進粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）的經貿發展。鮮活快線已由今年四月開始分階段進行試運，來自世界各地載有水果、冰鮮及活海鮮的空陸聯運貨物已順利使用此「綠色通道」經香港迅速中轉至珠海。

​陳子達於儀式上致辭時表示，鮮活快線能夠成功落實是有賴粵港兩地政府的努力及合作，迎難而上，拆牆鬆綁，才可以把兩地相關法規銜接，簡化清關程序，包括取得海關總署的支持於港珠澳大橋珠海公路口岸興建配備有先進溫控設施的指定監管場地、兩地海關採用嶄新思維及利用科技以簡化鮮活食品的中轉清關安排，並獲得食環署的支持豁免該計劃下空陸聯運轉運貨物食物進口商登記要求，為業界降本增效，令鮮活快線成為連接內地與世界各地的重要橋樑，強化香港作為國際物流樞紐的核心角色。陳子達強調香港海關將會繼續推進和深化與內地於不同範疇的高水平合作，共同為大灣區建設和國家發展貢獻重要力量。

The ceremony was officiated by the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, Mr Chan Tsz-tat; the Chief Executive Officer of the AAHK, Mrs Vivian Cheung; Party Committee Member of Gongbei Customs District and Director General of the Zhongshan Customs District, Mr Wang Baoren; the Deputy Director-General of the Police Liaison Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Ms Meng Xiaoyuan; Legislative Council Member (Transport Functional Constituency) Mr Frankie Yick; and the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene, Mr Donald Ng.

ââThe Air-Land Fresh Lane, jointly launched by the Guangdong and Hong Kong governments, aims to utilise the strengths of Hong Kong International Airport and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) to facilitate overseas fresh products imported into the Mainland while empowering high-quality fresh products from the Mainland to go global by adopting a new regulatory model to streamline customs clearance for fresh products. This leverages Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" and a ""super value-adder"" to promote economic and trade developments in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Since April this year, the Air-Land Fresh Lane has commenced its trial operations by phases; air-to-land consignments of fruits, chilled and live seafood originating from different parts of the world were smoothly imported into Zhuhai via Hong Kong through this ""green channel"".

Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Chan said that the successful implementation of the Air-Land Fresh Lane was attributed to the concerted efforts and co-operation of the governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong. By overcoming difficulties and removing barriers one by one, relevant regulations were able to be aligned between the two sides and have clearance procedures simplified, including securing the support from the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China to set up a designated inspection site at the HZMB Zhuhai Port with advanced temperature-controlled facilities, adopting a new mindset and advanced technology to streamline the clearance of fresh food transshipment, and gaining the support from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department to exempt the air-to-land food transshipment under this scheme from the food importer registration requirement. With these measures, the scheme will not only help the industry lower the operating cost but also enhance the overall efficiency, making it become a key bridge connecting the Mainland with global markets and fostering Hong Kong's role as an international logistics hub. Mr Chan also stressed that Hong Kong Customs will continue to promote and deepen high-level collaboration with the Mainland across different areas, thereby contributing to the developments of the GBA and the country.
â
Nearly 200 guests attended the launching ceremony, including representatives of Gongbei Customs, the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, and Zhuhai Municipal Bureau of Commerce, officials of the HKSAR Government, a Legislative Council Member, representatives of the AAHK, foreign consuls, and representatives from logistics associations, logistics and fresh food trade sectors."

During the operation, Customs officers detected four related cases, with approximately 5 900 litres of illicit motor spirit and five vehicles seized with an estimated market value over $1.4 million. Six persons were arrested.

On September 15 and 16, Customs detected two cases of smuggling of illicit fuel using cross-boundary lorries with altered fuel tanks to smuggle motor spirit into Hong Kong through the Shenzhen Bay Control Point and the Lok Ma Chau Control Point respectively. Suspected altered structures were found in tractors of two cross-boundary lorries. Approximately 2 715 litres of unmanifested motor spirit were seized with arrest of two male drivers aged 41 and 61. The two tractors of the lorries were also detained.

In addition, during the operation in downtown on September 17, Customs officers cracked down on a mobile illicit fueling station in a public car park in Tai Wai with 735 litres of illicit motor spirit and a batch of fueling equipment seized. A 31-year-old woman, believed to be the operator of the illegal fueling station, and a 44-year-old man who was coming for fueling, were arrested. Two private vehicles involved in the case were also detained. Moreover, Customs officers today (September 26) intercepted a suspicious lorry tractor parked at To Yuen Wai, Tuen Mun, with a hose connected from the vehicle into a nearby tin-sheet structure.

A 48-year-old woman, believed to be the operator of the illegal fueling station, and a 58-year-old male lorry driver were arrested. The lorry tractor was also detained.

The six arresteesare suspected of smuggling, dealing with or buying illicit fuel which violated various ordinance including the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO), Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Dangerous Goods Ordinance. Investigations are ongoing.

Hong Kong Customs will continue to collaborate with the FSD in combating illicit fuel activities. Customs reminds cross-boundary goods vehicle drivers not to engage in any smuggling activities. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any vehicle found to have the fittings, fabric orstructure beingaltered and used for smuggling purposes may be subject to forfeiture. Members of the public are also urged not to patronise illegal fueling stations. The use of illicit fuel is a criminal offence, and vehicles involved may be liable to confiscation.

Speech by SCST at opening ceremony of Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul in Seoul (English only) (with photo),2025-09-26 19:45,2025-09-26 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600979.htm," Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the opening ceremony of Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul in Seoul today (September 26):

Deputy Minister Yu (Deputy Minister for Public Communication, Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Republic of Korea, Mr Yu Byung-cha), Chief Executive Mr Park (Chief Executive Officer of National Theater of Korea, Mr Park In-gun), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening, Annyeonghaseyo (Korean: Hello). Welcome to the opening ceremony of Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul. I am absolutely delighted to be here with you to share and experience the unique cultural glamour of Hong Kong, right here in the heart of Seoul.

Throughout my career – from transport to tourism, sports and culture – my focus has always been on connecting people. I have always believed that the most empowering journeys are not just about physical experiences, but about the sentimental, transcendent memories we create. This evening, we gather at this beautiful destination to do just that, to foster shared cultural aspirations that will become our lasting memories.

Visiting Seoul feels familiar; I sense a kindred spirit in this dynamic metropolis. Our two cities share a common rhythm – a passion for creativity, reinvention, and for telling stories that move us. Whether it is a K-drama that tugs at your heartstrings or a Hong Kong film that lingers in your memory long after the credits roll, our two cities know how to create stories that resonate far beyond our borders.

Since signing the Memorandum of Understanding on Cultural Co-operation in 2004, Seoul and Hong Kong have built more than partnership; we have developed a deep friendship. Many of you here have brought immense joy to Hong Kong through the ""Festive Korea"" events each autumn. Now, it is our genuine pleasure to return that warmth with Hong Kong Week in Seoul.

Hong Kong Week in Seoul is more than a simple showcase; it is an invitation for all of us to experience Hong Kong in full dimension. Through the horizontal lens of dance, music, film, fashion, visual arts and comics, and the vertical depth of our pop culture, contemporary creations, and shared nostalgia, we offer you a vibrant portrait of our city.

Cantopop ballads and the golden age of Hong Kong cinema have profoundly influenced my own life. I know firsthand how culture lives in and shapes the human heart. That is why I am so excited for you to experience it all: the elegance of our orchestras, the energy of our dancers, our cinematic classics, and the neon-soaked soundscapes of our city.

Today's opening performance by the Hong Kong Ballet exemplifies this spirit. They will present a reimagined Romeo and Juliet in 1960s Hong Kong, blending classical ballet with the fluid power of kung fu. It is bold, poetic, and unmistakably Hong Kong. Our unique strength lies in our deep-rooted, East-meets-West culture.

Throughout the festival, you will see this fusion brought to life by our incredible arts groups – from the Hong Kong Dance Company and City Contemporary Dance Company to the Labora Terry Arts. You will hear it in the music of the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra, the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra and the Asian Modern Symphony Orchestra. And you will feel it in the creative sparks flying between students from the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts and Sungkyunkwan University.

For film and visual arts lovers, we offer a vibrant mix, from Chinese paintings and comics to a cinematic tribute under the stars at ImagineLand@Seoul. You will be treated to iconic soundtracks from both Hong Kong films and K-dramas, culminating in the screening of An Autumn’s Tale, a timeless classic that is still touching the soft parts of the audience’s hearts in the best way. And with extension activities such as post-screening talk, we hope to give you a deeper understanding of Hong Kong cinema.

But we are going beyond the screen. We are bringing Hong Kong film and fashion together in the Local Power exhibition and fashion show. We invite you to let your imagination take flight on a creative journey that fuses AI technology with pop music of Hong Kong and Korea, featuring designs from Hong Kong, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and Korean designers – showcasing the innovation and unique style of Asia's new generation.

Speaking of storytelling, I must mention our Hong Kong Comics and Culture Exhibition. We will showcase works from different eras, featuring classic Hong Kong comic characters and crossover projects that blend media formats, displaying the martial arts theme and distinctive humour that define Hong Kong comics.

Beyond the stages and screens, I hope this festival inspires you to see Hong Kong for yourself. I hope you will come to walk through our distinct districts, sip Hong Kong-style milk tea in a cha chaan teng, and take in our skyline from the Star Ferry. Our culture lives not just in theatres, but in our streets, our food, our people and even in our newest Kai Tak Sports Park, the Main Stadium of which can host 50 000 spectators under a retractable roof.

Before I close, I must extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Korea, and to every partner and artist for your support and contribution. Without you, this vision could not have become a reality.

I wish Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul a resounding success. Now, let us enjoy this evening together, and celebrate the bridges we are building – between our cities, between our cultures, and between our hearts.

Kamsahamnida (Korean: Thank you). Thank you."
CHP investigates case of invasive meningococcal infection,2025-09-26 19:36,2025-09-26 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600970.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 26) is investigating a case of invasive meningococcal infection, and reminds the public to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times to minimise the risk of contracting this serious disease.

ããThe case involves a 15-year-old boy with good past health. He presented with a fever, headache, vomiting and petechiae over his four limbs yesterday (September 25). He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital today and was admitted for treatment. He is now in a stable condition. His cerebrospinal fluid specimen tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was meningitis.

Preliminary investigation revealed that his household and school contacts have remained asymptomatic so far. The CHP has distributed preventive drugs to his family member and will continue to monitor the health status of the patient's family members and classmates. The CHP's investigation is ongoing.

Meningococcal infection is a statutory notifiable disease. Including this case, the CHP has recorded nine cases this year.

Meningococcal infection is caused by a bacterium known as meningococcus. It is mainly transmitted by direct contact with respiratory secretions, including droplets from the nose and throat, of infected persons. Severe illness may result when the bacteria invade the bloodstream (meningococcaemia) or the membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord (meningococcal meningitis). Meningococcaemia is characterised by a sudden onset of fever, an intense headache, purpura, shock and even death in severe cases. Meningococcal meningitis is characterised by high fever, severe headache, stiff neck followed by drowsiness, vomiting, fear of bright light, or rash; it can cause brain damage or even death.

To prevent meningococcal infection, members of the public are advised to take the following measures:


Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly, especially when they are soiled by respiratory secretions, e.g. after sneezing, and clean hands with alcohol-based handrub when they are not visibly soiled;
Cover the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing, hold the saliva with a tissue, dispose of nasal and mouth discharge in a lidded rubbish bin, and wash hands immediately;
Avoid crowded places;
Avoid close contact with patients who have a fever or severe headache;
Consult doctors about meningococcal vaccination before travelling to high-risk areas; and
Seek medical advice if you become ill after returning from high-risk areas, and discuss your recent travel history with your doctor.

Pilot project on e-trade document between Hong Kong and ASEAN (with photos),2025-09-26 19:02,2025-09-26 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600631.htm," The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, today (September 26) highlighted that Hong Kong strives to explore collaboration opportunities between the single windows of the city and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to promote cross-boundary digital and paperless trade in the region.

 During the discussions at the ninth ASEAN Economic Ministers (AEM) - Hong Kong, China (HKC) Consultation in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Mr Yau said that HKC has been promoting the digitalisation of business-to-government trade documents and is developing the Trade Single Window (TSW) in three phases to provide a one-stop electronic platform for the trade to submit various trade documents for trade declaration and cargo clearance.

 Acknowledging ASEAN as HKC's second-largest trading partner, Mr Yau noted that HKC is keen to explore the possibility of exchanging trade documents through a collaboration between the ASEAN Single Window and HKC's TSW. As the first step, HKC and ASEAN will explore taking forward a pilot project of exchanging the electronic Certificate of Origin.

 He said he looks forward to the implementation of the pilot project, adding that HKC will continue to work closely with ASEAN and ASEAN member states to explore further collaboration.

 Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the TSW in Hong Kong are already in full service and are well received by the trade. The Government is now pressing ahead with the development of the information technology system of TSW Phase 3 and targets to roll out the services by batch from mid-2026. Upon the full implementation of the TSW, it will have the technical capability to connect with the single windows of other economies or other commercial systems.

 As mentioned in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, Hong Kong strives to explore opportunities for connecting the TSW with the single windows of other economies. Therefore, on top of exploring connectivity with the ASEAN Single Window, Hong Kong has been actively working with the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China to connect the TSW with the Mainland's International Trade Single Window to continue to provide the Mainland-Hong Kong ""Single Submission for Dual Declaration"" Scheme for cargo after the rollout of TSW Phase 3, allowing more enterprises to benefit from the convenience of completing Customs declarations for both the Mainland and Hong Kong sides by making a single submission of road cargo information. Both sides will continue to explore the feasibility of expanding the Scheme to cover other trade documents and transport modes.

 Meanwhile, Mr Yau and the Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry of Malaysia, Mr Tengku Zafrul Aziz, met at a bilateral meeting at the margins of the AEM-HKC Consultation and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Co-operation in Digital Trade to encourage and promote bilateral co-operation in digital trade, including electronic commerce, paperless trade and single window interoperability.

 ""Malaysia is an important trading partner of Hong Kong. The MOU is a demonstration of our longstanding and close relationship, and our desire to further collaborate in areas like digital trade in order to bring mutual economic benefits to our people,"" Mr Yau said."
香港與東盟電子貿易文件先導計劃（附圖）,2025-09-26 19:02,2025-09-26 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600641.htm,"商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺今日（九月二十六日）強調，香港致力開拓與東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）就單一窗口的合作機遇，以促進區內跨境數字貿易及無紙化貿易的發展。

丘應樺在馬來西亞吉隆坡出席第九屆中國香港─東盟經貿部長會議的討論環節時表示，香港一直推動「企業對政府」貿易文件數字化，並正分三階段實施「貿易單一窗口」，提供一站式電子平台，供業界提交各項貿易文件作報關及貨物清關之用。

丘應樺表示，東盟是香港第二大貿易夥伴，香港銳意探討透過雙方的單一窗口系統之間的協作以交換貿易文件的可能性。作為第一步，香港與東盟會探討推行一項交換電子產地來源證的先導計劃。

他表示期待落實先導計劃，並指香港會繼續與東盟及其成員國緊密合作，探討加強協作。

香港「貿易單一窗口」的第一及第二階段已全面投入服務，並深受業界歡迎。政府正全力推進第三階段的資訊科技系統開發工作，目標是於二○二六年年中起分批推出服務。「貿易單一窗口」全面實施後，將具備技術能力與其他經濟體的單一窗口或其他商業系統連接。

《行政長官2025年施政報告》提到，香港致力探討「貿易單一窗口」與其他經濟體的單一窗口連接的機會。因此，除了尋求與東盟的單一窗口連接外，香港亦積極與國家海關總署合作，推動香港「貿易單一窗口」與內地的國際貿易單一窗口連接，以期在「貿易單一窗口」第三階段推出後，延續內地與香港貨物「一單兩報」計劃，讓更多企業受惠於道路貨物資料「一次錄入，雙向共用」的便利。雙方將繼續探討擴展計劃至涵蓋其他貿易文件及運輸模式的可行性。

在經貿部長會議期間，丘應樺亦與馬來西亞投資、貿易及工業部長Tengku Zafrul Aziz舉行雙邊會面，並簽署數字貿易合作諒解備忘錄，以鼓勵和推動雙方就數字貿易的合作，包括電子商貿、無紙化貿易及單一窗口對接。

丘應樺說：「馬來西亞是香港的重要貿易夥伴。是次簽署合作諒解備忘錄彰顯了雙方長久以來的緊密聯繫，以及我們銳意加強在數字貿易等領域的合作，為兩地人民帶來共同經濟裨益。」"

衞生防護中心調查一宗侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染個案,2025-09-26 19:00,2025-09-26 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600950.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月二十六日）正調查一宗侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染個案，同時提醒市民時刻注意個人和環境衞生，以減低被傳染這種嚴重疾病的風險。

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的15歲男童。他昨日（九月二十五日）開始出現發燒、頭痛、嘔吐及四肢瘀斑，今日到伊利沙伯醫院急症室求醫，需留院治療，現時情況穩定。他的腦脊液樣本經化驗後，證實對腦膜炎雙球菌呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為腦膜炎。

初步調查顯示，他的家人和同學暫時沒有出現病徵。中心已向其家人派發預防性藥物，並監察病人的家人及同班同學的健康情況。中心會繼續調查個案。

侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染是法定須呈報傳染病。計及上述個案，中心今年錄得九宗個案。

腦膜炎雙球菌感染是由腦膜炎雙球菌所引起，主要經由直接接觸帶菌者的呼吸道分泌物（包括口鼻分泌物）而傳播。當細菌入侵血液（腦膜炎雙球菌血症）或包圍腦部及脊髓的內膜（流行性腦膜炎）時，可引致嚴重病症。腦膜炎雙球菌血症的病徵包括突發性發燒、劇烈頭痛、皮膚出現瘀斑及休克，嚴重者甚至會致命。流行性腦膜炎的病徵包括發高燒、劇烈頭痛、頸部僵硬及嗜睡，亦會有嘔吐、畏光或皮疹等情況出現，若情況嚴重更可造成腦部損害或死亡。

中心呼籲市民採取以下預防措施以預防腦膜炎雙球菌感染：


用梘液和清水正確洗手，尤其在雙手被呼吸道分泌物污染時，如打噴嚏後。當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，可用酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時應掩着口鼻，用紙巾包裹痰涎，棄置於有蓋的垃圾桶內，並即時洗手；
避免到人多擠迫的地方；
避免與出現發燒或劇烈頭痛病徵的病人作親密接觸；
前往高危地區前，應諮詢醫生有關接種腦膜炎雙球菌疫苗的詳情；及
從高危地區返港後若感到不適，應立即求診，並告知醫生近期曾到訪的地區。


​市民可參閱衞生防護中心網頁以取得更多有關腦膜炎雙球菌感染的資料。"
Speech by CE at opening ceremony of Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul (English only) (with video),2025-09-26 19:00,2025-09-26 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600356.htm,"Following is the video speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the opening ceremony of Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul today (September 26):

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening everybody. Annyeonghaseyo (Korean: Hello)!

It is a great pleasure to welcome you all, to the opening ceremony of Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul. Since 2019, Hong Kong Week has been a flagship festival organised by the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government, bringing the vibrancy of Hong Kong's arts and culture to international audiences. Having previously staged in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Bangkok, we are glad to now enter the festival's fifth edition, here in Seoul.

For good reasons. Seoul, a dynamic city that celebrates both history and modernity, is committed to fostering innovation, economic development and cultural exchange.

Hong Kong is an international financial, shipping and trade centre. We are also fast developing as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange and an international innovation and technology hub. Our deep connectivity with Korea spans across business, investment, technology and culture, and creates immense opportunities for collaboration and mutual growth.

Hong Kong and Korea, I'm pleased to say, have flourished through our competence, and proficiency, in embracing heritage while driving the transformative capability of different arts forms.

Korea's rich cultural landscape, mesmerising traditional mask dance performances, musical storytelling, as well as its globally popular K-Pop and K-dramas, reflect our appreciation for both tradition and creativity, in breadth and in depth.

Similarly, Hong Kong's arts scene seamlessly blends classical and contemporary influences, establishing a unique identity that resonates with the aspirations of the international stage. These shared values render Hong Kong and Seoul natural partners in artistic collaboration, cultural exchange and creative dialogue.

A city of remarkable cultural richness, Seoul provides an outstanding setting for our Hong Kong Week this year.

This year's Hong Kong Week features an eclectic array of programmes, from Chinese and Western music, and traditional and contemporary dance, to new and restored Hong Kong films, and thought-provoking exhibitions. With performances staged by flagship arts groups as well as emerging young talents, this festival transcends an artistic showcase, and it will bring every participant on a fulfilling arts and cultural journey, filled with fascinating Hong Kong and Korean elements. An integration of our two vibrant cities.

Ladies and gentlemen, our Hong Kong Week will continue to shine on the global stage by deepening collaborations, building new partnerships, inspiring new creations and solidifying connections.

We will continue to foster our friendly relations with Seoul and Korea, not only in the area of arts and culture, but also in business, technology, finance, and more. I warmly invite your exploration of all that Hong Kong offers, through visiting our city, through investments, or through the many opportunities of professional and cultural exchanges we provide.

My sincere gratitude goes to our dedicated partners, especially the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Korea, for the tremendous support for making Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul a huge success.

Around 1 600 teachers commended at Teachers' Day ceremony (with photos),2025-09-26 18:50,2025-09-26 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600893.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Committee on Respect Our Teachers Campaign:

Organised by the Committee on Respect Our Teachers Campaign (CROTC), the Salute to Teachers 2025 - Teachers' Day Ceremony was held today (September 26). The Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, officiated at the ceremony and paid tribute to teachers for wholeheartedly nurturing talent with dedication to professionalism in education. Around 1 600 teachers are commended this year.

Speaking at the ceremony, the Chairman of the CROTC, Mr Wong Kam-leung, expressed his gratitude to the teachers for not only passing on knowledge but also cultivating students' affection for their home and country and shaping their character, all accomplished with patience, love, and wisdom. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Respect Our Teachers Campaign, and the CROTC has steadfastly upheld its mission and will continue to join together in promoting the traditional culture of respect for teachers.

Dr Choi expressed gratitude that the Respect Our Teachers Campaign, over the past 30 years, has not only united various sectors of society in their respect and support for teachers but also promoted the fine tradition of respecting teachers and education in Chinese culture, instilling positive energy into Hong Kong's education. She remarked that a professional and conscientious teaching force is the key to the success of Hong Kong education. Hong Kong's leading position in global competitiveness not only reflects the resilience and innovative vitality of its economy but also highlights the high-quality development of its education system and the professional leadership and strength of its teaching force.

She highlighted that the Education Bureau is committed to building a team of high-quality teachers and strongly supporting both teachers and principals in enhancing their professionalism. She emphasised the importance of promoting the cultivation of teachers' morality and ethics, and fostering the spirit of outstanding educators. She encouraged all teachers to regard outstanding educators as role models, to uphold the original aspiration of nurturing students, to drive innovation in teaching, and to strengthen professional exchange. With the teachers being good educators to children and exemplary role models to their peers, more outstanding individuals with virtues and talents can be nurtured.

The CROTC has been organising the Teachers' Commendation Scheme annually since 1995. With this year marking its 30th session, the scheme aims to foster a culture of respect for teachers. Under the scheme, secondary schools, primary schools, kindergartens and special schools may each nominate two teachers who have demonstrated commitment and excellence in teaching. Over 39 500 teachers have been commended in previous years.

Other officiating guests at the ceremony today included the Acting Permanent Secretary for Education, Ms Ida Lee; the Chairperson of the Curriculum Development Council, Professor Isabella Poon; and the Chairman of the Committee on Home-School Co-operation, Mr Eugene Fong."

商經局局長出席第九屆中國香港--東盟經貿部長會議（附圖）,2025-09-26 18:36,2025-09-26 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600670.htm,"商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺與馬來西亞投資、貿易及工業部長Tengku Zafrul Aziz今日（九月二十六日）在馬來西亞吉隆坡共同主持第九屆中國香港—東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）經貿部長會議，討論香港與東盟《自由貿易協定》（《自貿協定》）及《投資協定》的實施情況相關事宜，並就香港與東盟未來經濟合作方向等議題交換意見。

香港與東盟《自貿協定》及《投資協定》於二○一七年簽訂，是雙方夥伴關係蓬勃發展的重要支柱。自兩份協定簽訂以來，香港與東盟的商品貿易增加38%，而香港向東盟的直接投資亦增加42%。

丘應樺在會議上發言時，呼籲尚未完成所需內部程序以實施《修訂香港與東盟〈自貿協定〉的第一議定書》的東盟成員國加快進度，以期讓商號更好地利用《自貿協定》，從而促進各締約方的經貿關係發展。

此外，他期望早日簽訂《修訂香港與東盟〈投資協定〉的第一議定書》，為雙方投資者提供更可預測和更具確定性的市場准入，以進一步釋放協定的潛力。

《自貿協定》下新一輪的經濟和技術合作工作計劃今年展開。工作計劃旨在透過技術協助、知識轉移和信息分享活動，協助《自貿協定》的締約方提升能力，今年接獲43份項目建議書，反應十分正面。

丘應樺說：「值得一提的是，多份建議書均聚焦工作計劃下的新重點範疇，包括競爭、可持續經濟發展，以及在香港和東盟成員國日益受關注的議題，例如推廣清真食物。這反映區內的需求不斷轉變，以及我們共同致力深化彼此之間的經濟和技術合作。」

丘應樺亦藉此機會在會上重申香港已準備好盡早加入《區域全面經濟伙伴關係協定》（RCEP），並感謝東盟一直支持香港加入協定。他期望早日就成立香港的「加入工作組」取得實質進展，並通過相關職權範圍。

談及香港與東盟的未來經濟合作方向，丘應樺指數字經濟已成為經濟發展的重要支柱。他與東盟成員國分享香港支持中小型企業把握電商機遇的舉措，指「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」是香港其中一項為中小型企業而設的資助計劃，其下的「電商易」讓企業於700萬港元（約89.7萬美元）的累計資助上限中，靈活運用最多100萬港元（約12.8萬美元）在東盟經濟體推行電商項目。

丘應樺亦強調維護多邊貿易制度的重要性，以及香港堅定維護世界貿易組織（世貿組織）的公信力和效率。

他續說：「作為細小、開放及外向型經濟體，我們十分珍視以世貿組織為核心的非歧視性、以規則為本的多邊貿易制度，並視之為抗衡保護主義和無理措施的最佳屏障。尤其在此動盪時期，多邊貿易制度對確保全球供應鏈暢順運作至關重要。」

在經貿部長會議期間，丘應樺分別與Tengku Zafrul Aziz和東帝汶商業與工業部長Filipus Nino Pereira舉行雙邊會議，就共同關注的議題交換意見。他亦與東盟秘書長高金洪博士會面，討論多項經貿議題，並介紹香港就尋求盡早加入RCEP的準備工作。"
"SCED attends 9th ASEAN Economic Ministers - Hong Kong, China Consultation (with photos)",2025-09-26 18:36,2025-09-26 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600668.htm," The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, and the Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry of Malaysia, Mr Tengku Zafrul Aziz, cochaired the 9th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Ministers - Hong Kong, China (HKC) Consultation in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, today (September 26) to discuss issues relating to the implementation of the ASEAN-HKC Free Trade Agreement (AHKFTA) and the ASEAN-HKC Investment Agreement (AHKIA), and exchange views among others on the future direction of ASEAN-Hong Kong economic co-operation.

 The AHKFTA and the AHKIA signed in 2017 have served as the key pillars of the flourishing ASEAN-Hong Kong partnership. Since the signing of the agreements, Hong Kong's trade in goods with ASEAN has increased by 38 per cent and the city's outward direct investment to ASEAN has risen by 42 per cent.

 Speaking at the meeting, Mr Yau appealed to those ASEAN member states which have not yet completed their internal procedures to further expedite the processes for the implementation of the First Protocol to Amend the AHKFTA, so as to allow traders to better utilise the free trade agreement and in turn, further drive growth in the economic and trade relations among the parties.

 In addition, he said he looks forward to the early signing of the First Protocol to Amend the AHKIA, with a view to further unlocking the potential of the agreement through greater predictability and certainty in market access for investors of the two sides.

 This year also marks the new cycle of the Economic and Technical Cooperation (ECOTECH) Work Programme under the AHKFTA. The programme aims to build the capacities of the parties of the AHKFTA through technical assistance, knowledge transfer and information sharing activities. It received very positive responses with 43 project proposals submitted this year.

 ""Notably, several proposals focus on new priority areas of the ECOTECH Work Programme, such as competition and sustainable economic development, as well as topics that have been receiving increasing attention in Hong Kong and the ASEAN member states, such as promotion of Halal food. This demonstrates the region's evolving needs and the shared commitment to deepen economic and technical co-operation between us,"" Mr Yau said.

 At the meeting, Mr Yau took the opportunity to reiterate Hong Kong's readiness for early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and thank ASEAN for the continued support to Hong Kong's accession bid. He said he looks forward to having concrete progress in the establishment of an accession working group for Hong Kong soon, along with the adoption of the related terms of reference.

 Turning to the future direction of ASEAN-Hong Kong economic co-operation, Mr Yau noted that the digital economy has become a key pillar of economic development. He shared with ASEAN member states Hong Kong's support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to seize the opportunities brought about by e-commerce. Through the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales, one of the funding schemes for SMEs in Hong Kong, enterprises can flexibly make use of a maximum funding of HK$1 million (around US$128,000) within their cumulative funding ceiling of HK$7 million (around US$897,000) to implement e-commerce projects in ASEAN economies under the E-commerce Easy.

 Mr Yau also stressed the importance of upholding the multilateral trading system (MTS) and Hong Kong's commitment to maintain the credibility and efficiency of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

 ""As a small, open and externally oriented economy, we deeply value the non-discriminatory, rules-based MTS, with the WTO at its core, as our best safeguard against protectionism and arbitrary measures. Particularly in these turbulent times, the MTS is fundamental in ensuring the smooth functioning of global supply chains,"" he added.

 On the sidelines of the meeting, Mr Yau held bilateral meetings with Mr Tengku Zafrul Aziz, and the Minister of Commerce and Industry of Timor-Leste, Mr Filipus Nino Pereira, to exchange views on issues of mutual interest. He also met with the Secretary-General of ASEAN, Dr Kao Kim Hourn, to discuss various trade and economic issues, and brief him on Hong Kong's preparatory work in seeking early accession to the RCEP."

醫衞局局長盧寵茂教授表示：「在國家多個部委支持下，香港特區政府聯同廣東省和深圳市人民政府，以及澳門特區政府於去年十一月三十日正式推出為期一年的試行計劃。在香港特區政府與珠海市人民政府的共同努力下，兩地今日成功進行演練，理順跨境直通救護車運送流程。我們會持續檢視試行計劃的成效及運作經驗，以病人的醫療需要、安全和利益作首要考慮，並繼續積極推進《施政報告》提出有序擴展安排的目標，包括實施雙向轉運，以及擴展至南沙區。」

自試行計劃啓動以來，整體運作良好，至今已將16名病人由深圳和澳門的指定派送醫院（即香港大學深圳醫院和澳門仁伯爵綜合醫院）轉運到香港的指定公立醫院。根據專業醫療評估，上述個案的病人均有持續住院的治療需要，情況相對穩定，但無法自行返港，亦不適合經現有口岸轉乘香港救護車返港。"

 To ensure the smooth implementation of relevant arrangements, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, in collaboration with the People's Government of Zhuhai Municipality, conducted a drill today to assess the simulated transfer of patients under the cross-boundary ambulance arrangements. The drill was conducted smoothly in general, and it is expected that the Pilot Scheme can be extended to Zhuhai by the end of this year.

 In his recent Policy Address, the Chief Executive has proposed to extend the cross-boundary ambulance transfer arrangements with the governments of Guangdong and Macao in an orderly manner, including two-way transfers and expansion to cover designated hospitals in Zhuhai and Nansha. Following liaison between the HHB and Zhuhai and Nansha, the designated hospitals of the two places have been identified as ZHPH and the Nansha Division of the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University respectively. Today's drill mainly aimed at testing the routing of the cross-boundary ambulance between ZHPH and the designated hospital in Hong Kong (i.e. Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH)), as well as the immigration arrangements. After departure from ZHPH, the designated Zhuhai cross-boundary ambulance travelled to PMH via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Zhuhai Port and later returned to Zhuhai via the HZMB.

 The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""With the support of various national ministries, the HKSAR Government, in collaboration with the Guangdong Provincial Government, the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government, and the Macao Special Administrative Region Government, officially launched the one-year Pilot Scheme on November 30 last year. Through the concerted efforts of the HKSAR Government and the People's Government of Zhuhai Municipality, today's drill was conducted successfully to streamline the flow of direct cross-boundary ambulance transfer. We will continue to review the effectiveness and operational experience of the Pilot Scheme, with the medical needs, safety and interests of patients as the prime concerns, as well as to press ahead with the objective of extending the arrangements in an orderly manner, including implementing two-way transfers and expansion to cover Nansha as set out in the Policy Address.""

 The overall operation of the Pilot Scheme has been smooth since its implementation. A total of 16 patients were transferred from the designated sending hospitals in Shenzhen and Macao (i.e. the University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen Hospital and the Conde S. Januario Hospital of Macao) to designated public hospitals in Hong Kong. According to professional medical assessment, patients of the above cases have a need for continuous hospitalisation for treatment. Their conditions were relatively stable, but they were unable to return to Hong Kong on their own and were unsuitable for transfer to Hong Kong ambulances via the existing boundary control points."

香港金融管理局（金管局）與中國人民銀行（人民銀行）、中國證券監督管理委員會和國家外匯管理局共同推動的跨境債券回購業務今日（九月二十六日）正式推出。

相關內地金融監督管理部門今日聯合發布《關於進一步支持境外機構投資者在中國債券市場開展債券回購業務的公告》，支持所有已進入內地在岸債券市場的境外機構（包括「債券通」投資者）參與在岸債券回購業務，從在岸市場獲得人民幣流動性，並匯出境外使用。措施是繼金管局於今年二月推出離岸人民幣債券回購業務之後的又一項重要政策，將為香港離岸人民幣市場提供更穩定的流動性，有效降低人民幣融資成本。跨境回購和離岸人民幣回購業務相輔相成，能滿足離岸投資者的資産配置和流動性管理需求，盤活人民幣債券持倉，從而進一步提升在岸債券的國際吸引力，增強人民幣在國際市場的投融資功能。

金管局總裁余偉文表示：「我們很高興正式推出跨境回購業務。這是金管局和人民銀行一直緊密合作，以持續優化『債券通』業務的重點工作之一。措施有助於提升香港離岸人民幣市場的流動性，以及境外投資者配置人民幣資產的意願，引導更多元化的離岸人民幣業務發展，以進一步鞏固提升香港作為國際金融中心和離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。」"

The cross-boundary bond repurchase (repo) business, jointly advocated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the People's Bank of China (PBoC), the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange was officially launched today (September 26).

Relevant Mainland financial authorities/regulators jointly issued the ""Notice to Further Supporting Overseas Institutional Investors in Conducting Bond Repo Business in China's Bond Market"" today. Under this policy measure, all overseas institutional investors already investing in the onshore bond market, including Bond Connect investors, will be allowed to participate in the onshore repo business and to remit the RMB liquidity thus obtained for offshore use. This measure is another important policy initiative following the launch of the offshore RMB repo business by the HKMA in February this year. It will provide more stable liquidity support for Hong Kong's offshore RMB market, and effectively lower the RMB funding cost. The cross-boundary repo and offshore RMB repo businesses will complement each other in addressing offshore investors' needs of asset allocation and liquidity management. It will help activate offshore investors' onshore bond holdings and further enhance the attractiveness of onshore bonds, thereby promoting the use of RMB as an investment and funding currency in the international markets.

  TheChief Executive of the HKMA,Mr Eddie Yue, said, ""We are pleased to launch the cross-boundary repo business. This is one of the key initiatives on which the HKMA and the PBoC have been working closely, to continuously enhance the Bond Connect business.

This in turn will help consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and an offshore RMB business hub."""

Ms Chan and the delegation were received and welcomed by the Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress, Mr Peng Qinghua, at the Great Hall of the People. They then met with officials of the Ministry of Education. Ms Chan said that this year marks the 80th Anniversary of the Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. It was profoundly meaningful to travel to Nanjing and Beijing with representatives from the education sector before National Day, visiting the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders, and the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the Marco Polo Bridge in Beijing, commemorating and remembering the nation's martyrs and bearing in mind the profound inspiration of ""taking history as a mirror and cherishing peace"".

Ms Chan expressed gratitude to the Ministry of Education, the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Department of Education of Jiangsu Province and various Mainland units for their strong support, facilitating the smooth conduct of the exchange programme.

This year, the delegation comprised around 130 participants from the education sector, including representatives from tertiary education institutions and professional education organisations, as well as principals, vice-principals and teachers from primary and secondary schools and kindergartens. The delegation began a six-day visit on September 22. Apart from visiting significant sites of the War of Resistance in Nanjing and Beijing and observing the flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square, they also toured the Regional University-Industry Technology Transfer Center (Jiangsu), Peking University, Nanjing University, primary and secondary schools, kindergartens, and an innovation technology enterprise to learn about the latest national developments in education and innovation technology and strengthen exchanges with Mainland educators, broadening professional horizons.

Ms Chan and the delegation will conclude their visit and return to Hong Kong tomorrow (September 27)."
InvestHK leads delegation to Europe showcasing Hong Kong's strengths as leading family office hub (with photos),2025-09-26 18:15,2025-09-26 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600735.htm,"  The Global Head of Family Office at Invest Hong Kong, Mr Jason Fong, yesterday (September 25) concluded a European mission spanning London, Zurich, Geneva and Milan, where he led a delegation to highlight Hong Kong's strengths as a leading global family office hub. This trip has prompted greater interest among European families and professionals in exploring the opportunities available in Hong Kong.

  During the visit, Mr Fong and the delegation held a series of in-depth exchanges with European family offices, family representatives, asset owners, wealth managers and professional service providers. These engagements included roundtables, panel sessions, high-level forums, investor luncheons and one-on-one meetings. The meetings highlighted Hong Kong's advantages as Asia's leading international financial centre - an open-architecture capital market. The robust legal system in Hong Kong and the unique positioning under ""one country, two systems"" showcase the city as the ideal hub for European investors seeking to access Chinese Mainland and Asian markets.

  Mr Fong said, ""As a true international financial centre and Asia's largest cross-border wealth management hub, Hong Kong offers unparalleled advantages for global families seeking long-term and diversified growth. With the Government's dedicated FamilyOfficeHK team and a comprehensive suite of facilitation measures, we welcome European families to establish a presence in Hong Kong, expand their businesses, and capture the immense growth opportunities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Mainland.""

  The Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Strela Capital GmbH, Ms Ekaterina Tattersall, pointed out, ""Switzerland has long been recognised as a trusted hub for cross-border asset management in Europe, and Hong Kong plays an equally vital role in the Asian region. Both markets boast robust regulatory frameworks, deep financial expertise, and global connectivity as their core advantages. For us, Hong Kong is an indispensable extension of our global wealth strategy.""

  The Director of Bernina Bioinvest, a private investment company focused on early-stage biotech and medtech, Dr Bettina Ernst, said, ""Hong Kong's growing life sciences ecosystem - combining academic research, clinical networks, and capital - makes it a compelling base for early-stage biotech and medtech innovation. For investors like us, the city's regional connectivity and regulatory openness create practical pathways from laboratory ideas to clinical and commercial milestones. Hong Kong sits at a valuable intersection of talent, research, and partnerships across Asia, which is an excellent location for investing in innovation. For early-stage biotech and medtech companies, access to universities, clinicians, and cross-border collaborators helps accelerate validation and scale, which is essential for translating science into patient impact.""

  The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Wings Securities Limited, Mr Cliff Ip, one of the members of the Hong Kong delegation to Europe, said, ""This trip was an exciting step in strengthening the connection between Hong Kong and European family offices. It opened doors for vibrant exchanges of investment ideas and sparked strong enthusiasm on both sides to explore co-investment opportunities. Embracing diversification across Hong Kong, Chinese Mainland, Asia and Europe is proving to be one of the powerful strategies for enhancing portfolio resilience. With world-class infrastructure, a strong talent pool, and resolute government support for the development of the family office sector, Hong Kong has firmly established itself as an essential player in the global family office dialogue.""

  ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" emphasises continued growth and support for the family office sector, including further enhancing preferential tax regimes for funds, single family offices and the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme."

尊敬的張宇人議員、各位愛心食肆代表、各位嘉賓、各位老友記：

  大家好！我今日很高興出席「愛心食肆賞你惠食」第三輪活動啓動禮這個我覺得是非常有意義的活動。

  「愛心食肆賞你惠食」能夠推展至第三輪，充份展現了政、商、民跨界別協作的力量。我要感謝張宇人議員牽頭策劃，主動聯繫本地飲食集團，令支持計劃的集團由第一輪的五間、第二輪的六間，增加至第三輪的七間。我很期望第四輪、第五輪的時候有更多食肆參加。

  我亦衷心感謝各飲食集團，包括大快活集團、大家樂集團、太興飲食集團、美心集團、香港麥當勞、銀龍飲食集團和香港必勝客有限公司，鼎力支持這項充滿愛心的活動。

  「愛心食肆賞你惠食」活動不單止為長者提供飲食優惠，同時促進長者中心與長者建立一個更緊密的聯繫，這是我們最想達到的目的；我亦希望吸引一些未曾接觸過長者中心服務的長者認識我們的社區資源，邀請他們加入這些長者中心。首兩輪活動中，非長者中心會員領取優惠券的比例，由15%提升至超過21%，充份反映計劃的成果。因為其實不認識我們提供的服務的長者，可能才是最需要這些服務。所以我們很希望他們能夠多出來，讓我們了解一下他們的服務需要，由我們的同事主動轉介給社工，轉介其他專業人士跟進，讓他們生活開心點。這個我覺得是很重要，亦是活動最主要的目的。

  在第三輪活動，我們會繼續透過長者中心，向獨居長者、雙老住戶及隱蔽長者派發餐飲優惠券，傳達社會對長者的關懷。我很高興知道餐飲優惠券的數量，由首兩輪的50 000套，增加至這一輪的60 000套，同樣我都希望未來會越來越多，我們希望有更多長者受惠。每位受惠長者只需拿着這些優惠劵，即可於今年十月一日至十一月三十日，以15元優惠價享用七間參與活動飲食集團的指定下午茶餐。我們有試過早餐，有試過午餐，現在有下午茶餐，我覺得張宇人議員很細心，天氣熱的時候就早餐，天氣沒那麼熱的時候就下午茶餐，想得好細緻，我很感謝他，亦希望借這些機會，透過這些優惠券，希望我們長者朋友可以約三五知己，在下午空閒時間，就去吃一點下午茶，這個就最開心。

  特區政府積極構建長者友善的樂齡社會。行政長官在最新一份《施政報告》中，亦宣布設立社會高齡化對策工作組，制訂涵蓋安老、醫療、房屋、文化娛樂及樂齡科技等範疇的對策，我們希望構建一個長者友善的樂齡社會。

  《施政報告》亦宣布將長者社區照顧服務券總數增加4 000張，至16 000張，並增設三個長者鄰舍中心，加強地區支援服務。特區政府亦會與香港工業總會合作制訂「銀色Q嘜」計劃，並與業界進一步研究為銀色產品制訂更多大灣區標準，方便我們拓展市場，為長者提供更豐富及優質的產品。

  今天，我們非常高興邀請到很多位受惠長者代表來到現場，分享您們的感受。很感謝您們的參與，與我們一同見證這個充滿愛與關懷的計劃啟動。希望各位長者不單止能夠享受實惠美味的餐點，更能深深感受到社會對您們的關懷。

  最後，我要再一次衷心感謝七間飲食集團為我們的長者送上關愛，並祝願計劃順利推展，惠及更多長者，共同構建一個更和諧共融的社會。還有不到兩星期就是中秋佳節，我祝願各位老友記中秋快樂、身體健康、生活美滿。期待大家繼續積極參與社區活動，拓闊大家的生活圈子，感受香港社會處處洋溢的溫情和關愛。多謝大家！"
Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited interim results highlights for 2025,2025-09-26 18:00,2025-09-26 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600755.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited (HKMC) today (September 26) announced the highlights of its interim results for 2025.

Business Highlights

  The HKMC and its subsidiaries continued to fulfil their core missions and social objectives, contributing to the steady growth of Hong Kong's economy amid an increasingly complex and evolving environment. The missions of the HKMC are to promote: the stability of the banking sector, wider home ownership, the development of the local debt market, and the development of the retirement planning market.

Asset Purchase 


Acquired HK$2.7 billion of loan assets (1H 2024: HK$6.7 billion)
Purchased HK$46 million of loans (1H 2024: HK$32 million) from the Dedicated 100% Loan Guarantee Schemes (DLGS)
Outstanding balance of loan portfolio was HK$85.6 billion as at June 30, 2025 (December 31, 2024: HK$95.5 billion)


Debt Issuance


Issued corporate debts of HK$23.3 billion for 1H 2025 (1H 2024: HK$57.1 billion), being one of the most active issuers in the domestic market of Hong Kong dollar corporate bonds.Among them, the HKMC had issued 30-year bonds totalling HK$500 million to promote the fixed-rate reverse mortgage business and local debt market development
Outstanding balance of debt securities issued was HK$135.6 billion as atJune 30, 2025 (December 31, 2024: HK$148.3 billion)
Credit ratings of AA+ from S&P Global Ratings and Aa3 from Moody's, same as those of the HKSAR Government


Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP)


New MIP loans drawn down amounted to HK$17.5 billion (1H 2024: HK$28.3 billion), of which 61 per cent were secured on properties in the secondary market
Facilitated home purchase for about 239 000 families in total since its launch in 1999, with an aggregate loan drawdown of HK$887.2 billion


SME Financing Guarantee Scheme


For the 80% Guarantee Product, more than 28 500 applications were approved with a total loan amount of approximately HK$122.4 billion since its launch in 2012.For the 90% Guarantee Product, over 16 800 applications were approved with a total loan amount of approximately HK$29.6 billion since its launch in 2019 
In respect of the Special 100% Loan Guarantee, more than 67 100 applications were approved with a total loan amount of approximately HK$143.9 billion since its launch in 2020. An equivalent amount of loan assets was purchased by the HKMC. The application period expired at end-March 2024
Since the inception of each guarantee product, the 80% and 90% Guarantee Products had benefitted over 23 800 local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and around 391 700 related employees. The Special 100% Loan Guarantee had benefitted more than 40 000 local SMEs and around 400 000 related employees


Dedicated 100% Loan Guarantee Schemes


Under the DLGS for Travel Sector and the DLGS for Cross-boundary Passenger Transport Trade, 227 applications were approved with a total loan amount of approximately HK$220 million since the launch of the DLGS in 2023. Their application periods expired in October 2024
In respect of the DLGS for Battery Electric Taxis, 374 applications were approved with a total loan amount of approximately HK$121 million since its launch in 2023


Annuity Business


The annuity business has taken a total of 11 531 policies (1H 2024: 2 295 policies), with total premiums of HK$5.4 billion (1H 2024: HK$1.1 billion)
Since its launch in 2018, it had helped about 30 000 senior citizens to convert their savings into lifelong stable income


Reverse Mortgage Programme


488 applications were approved (1H 2024: 546 applications), with an average property value of HK$4.1 million and an average monthly payout of HK$9,800
Since its launch in 2011, 8 412 applications were approved


Financial Highlights

The unaudited consolidated profit after tax of the HKMC for 1H 2025 was HK$53.3 million (1H 2024: HK$9 million). The improvement in profitability was largely attributable to the increase in income from the placements with the Exchange Fund, reduced negative impact on fast-growing reverse mortgage business from movement of property price for 1H 2025 as compared to 1H 2024, foreign exchange gain arising from exposures in cash and debt investments amid favourable market conditions, and increase in net interest income. Such gains were partly offset by the increase in accounting loss from insurance results of annuity business, reflecting the increase in new policies written from the spillover effect of the payout enhancement and discount campaign launched in 2024.

Since the HKMC is mandated to promote the development of the retirement planning market in Hong Kong, it is dedicated to advancing the annuity and reverse mortgage businesses which are subject to the increasing sensitivity and volatility of mark-to-market accounting effects. For the better assessment of financial performance, after excluding (i) the accounting results of HKMC Annuity Limited (HKMCA), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the HKMC operating annuity business; (ii) the impact of property price changes on the reverse mortgage business given its long-term nature; and (iii) the consolidation adjustments in respect of loan portfolios with insurance cover provided by HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI), another wholly-owned subsidiary of the HKMC operating general insurance business, the adjusted profit after tax, annualised return on equity and cost-to-income ratio for 1H 2025 would be HK$874 million, 6.2 per cent and 14.2 per cent respectively (1H 2024: HK$468 million, 6.2 per cent and 22.4 per cent respectively).

As at June 30, 2025, the embedded value of the annuity business was about HK$21.6 billion on the basis of the Insurance Ordinance (Cap. 41), which comprised HK$18.5 billion of total equity and HK$3.1 billion of present value of future profits. This indicates a solid financial position of the HKMCA to develop the annuity business in the long term.

In accordance with the Guidelines on Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), the calculation of capital ratio follows the basis of consolidation for financial reporting with the exclusion of regulated subsidiaries which are subject to separate requirements on the maintenance of adequate capital (i.e. the HKMCA and the HKMCI, both being regulated by the Insurance Authority). Excluding the investment cost of such unconsolidated regulated subsidiaries, the HKMC's CAR remained solid at 18.7 per cent as at June 30, 2025 (December 31, 2024: 19.9 per cent), well above the minimum requirement of 8 per cent stipulated by the Financial Secretary.

The solvency ratios of the HKMCA and the HKMCI as at June 30, 2025, calculated in accordance with the Insurance (Valuation and Capital) Rules (Cap. 41R) under the Risk-based Capital regime, were about 2.2 times (December 31, 2024: 1.7 times) and 3.7 times (December 31, 2024: 4 times) respectively, each well above the minimum regulatory requirements stipulated by the Insurance Authority.

Amid uncertain market conditions, the HKMC adopted prudent prefunding strategy and proactively communicated with local and international investment communities for debt issuance to support its sizable loan purchase and fulfil its refinancing needs. With strong financing capability and liquidity position, the HKMC's core operations remain resilient and stand ready to cope with any financial turbulence ahead in performing its strategic policy roles and attaining its social objectives."

財務摘要

按揭證券公司二○二五年上半年的未經審核綜合除稅後溢利為5,330萬港元（二○二四年上半年：900萬港元）。溢利增加主要由於外匯基金存款回報增加；快速增長之安老按揭業務於二○二五年上半年受物業價格變動帶來的負面影響相比二○二四年同期減少；於有利的市況下，持有的現金及債務投資所產生的外匯收益增加；以及淨利息收入增加。而部分溢利則被來自年金業務保險業績之會計虧損增加所抵銷，反映因二○二四年推出的年金增加及折扣活動的外溢效應帶動新造保單數量增加。

由於肩負促進香港退休規劃市場發展的使命，按揭證券公司一直致力於推動年金及安老按揭業務，而該等業務則受於市場計價會計帶來日益增加的敏感性及波動性所影響。為對財務表現作更佳的評估，在撇除（一）按揭證券公司從事年金業務的全資附屬公司——香港年金有限公司（香港年金公司）的財務業績、（二）業務性質為長年期的安老按揭業務受物業價格變化的影響，以及（三）對由按揭證券公司從事一般保險業務的另一全資附屬公司——香港按證保險有限公司（按證保險公司）提供保險保障的貸款組合作出的綜合財務會計調整的影響後，二○二五年上半年經調整的除稅後溢利、年化權益回報率和成本對收入比率分別為8.74億港元、6.2%及14.2%（二○二四年上半年：分別為4.68億港元、6.2%及22.4%）。

截至二○二五年六月三十日，年金業務按《保險業條例》（第41章）基準計算的內涵價值約為216億港元，當中包括權益總額185億港元和預期將來利潤的現值31億港元，反映了香港年金公司的穩健財務狀況可支持年金業務長遠發展。

根據資本充足率指引，資本充足率的計算乃跟隨綜合財務報告之綜合基礎，並撇除受規管且須遵守其他維持充足資本要求之附屬公司（即受保險業監管局規管的香港年金公司和按證保險公司）。撇除未予綜合之受規管附屬公司的投資成本後，按揭證券公司資本充足率於二○二五年六月三十日仍處於18.7%（二○二四年十二月三十一日：19.9%）的穩健水平，遠高於財政司司長規定的8%最低要求。

根據風險為本資本制度下之《保險業（估值及資本）規則》第41R章而計算的償付能力充足率，香港年金公司和按證保險公司於二○二五年六月三十日的償付能力充足率分別約為2.2倍（二○二四年十二月三十一日：1.7倍）及3.7倍（二○二四年十二月三十一日：4倍），遠高於保險業監管局規定的法定最低要求。

基於不明朗的市場環境，按揭證券公司採取審慎預先籌措融資的策略，並主動與本地及國際的投資業界就債券發行保持溝通，以支持購買大額的貸款及滿足再融資的需要。建基於強勁的融資能力及流動性水平，按揭證券公司的核心業務保持靈活穩健，並為應對金融動盪作出了充分準備，以執行其策略性政策角色和達成社會目標。"
反非法勞工行動拘十人（附圖）,2025-09-26 17:50,2025-09-26 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600864.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）自九月十九日起在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，包括聯同香港警務處執行的「冠軍行動」。截至昨日（九月二十五日），行動中共拘捕十名懷疑非法勞工。

反非法勞工行動中，入境處調查人員搜查了二十八個目標地點，包括餐廳、住宅大廈、工廠大廈及零售店等，共拘捕十名懷疑非法勞工。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為七男三女，年齡介乎二十四至五十六歲。

有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

市民可使用舉報非法勞工專線3861 5000、24小時舉報熱線2824 1551、傳真2824 1166、電郵anti_crime@immd.gov.hk、或登入入境處網址www.immd.gov.hk利用「網上舉報違反入境條例罪行」表格向入境處舉報僱用非法勞工活動。"
10 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photo),2025-09-26 17:50,2025-09-26 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600861.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations, including a joint operation with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Champion"", from September 19. As of September 25, a total of 10 suspected illegal workers were arrested.

  During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers raided 28 target locations including restaurants, residential buildings, industrial buildings and retail stores. Ten suspected illegal workers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised seven men and three women, aged 24 to 56.

  An investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years.

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, 24-hour Immigration Offences Hotline 2824 1551, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-26 17:30,2025-09-26 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600833.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 26), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 23 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of August, approximately 317 000 CF cases and 135 CF-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

 
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Over 40 experts and delegates from 10 APEC member economies gathered to explore strategies on the application of green and low-carbon hydrogen in land transport, as well as to share experience and exchange technical insights.

In a video welcoming speech, the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, highlighted that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of this era and underscored Hong Kong, China's commitment to four decarbonisation strategies, namely ""Net-zero electricity generation"", ""Energy saving and green buildings"", ""Green transport"", and ""Waste reduction"" under its Climate Action Plan 2050, with a view to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

Mr Tse said that apart from electric vehicles, hydrogen is a possible alternative for green transportation, particularly for heavy-duty and long-range transport applications. He added that the Government has set out the Strategy of Hydrogen Development in Hong Kong with a view to creating a local environment conducive to the development of hydrogen energy in a prudent and orderly manner. In addition, the Inter-departmental Working Group on Using Hydrogen as Fuel has been set up to introduce interim standards for hydrogen applications, and supported pilot projects such as hydrogen fuel cell buses, street-washing vehicles and cross-boundary hydrogen transportation, to remove barriers and facilitate commencement of local hydrogen applications. Mr Tse also mentioned that Hong Kong, China is well positioned to serve as a hub for hydrogen technologies, green finance and professional services, and reiterated Hong Kong, China's support for APEC's shared vision of clean energy transition and sustainable growth.

The Director of Electrical and Mechanical Services, Mr Poon Kwok-ying, shared at the workshop Hong Kong's latest hydrogen developments concerning the application of land transport. He thanked the APEC member economies for their participation, exchanging insights and experience and exploring collaboration to unlock the potential of hydrogen energy in establishing a greener and more sustainable future.

The APEC EWG aims to further APEC's goals to facilitate energy trade and investment to ensure that energy contributes to the enhancement of economic, social and environmental conditions of APEC member economies. The EWG consists of members from 21 APEC member economies and convenes meetings twice a year. It holds workshops on various themes to facilitate the achievement of APEC's energy goals."

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on September 25 to noon today (September 26), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 199 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 167 958 samples of food imported from Japan (including 109 730 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 37 904 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

Customs officers intercepted a 26-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on July 4. A total of 11 400 alternative smoking products were seized from his personal baggage with an estimated market value of $34,200. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

"Asia+ Festival to present Olivier Award winner South African choreographer Robyn Orlin's work ""We wear our wheels with pride"" in October (with photos)",2025-09-26 17:00,2025-09-26 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600452.htm,"  The Asia+ Festival, presented by the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and organised by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, will offer an exhilarating multi-media dance production, ""We wear our wheels with pride"", on October 18 and 19. The programme is created by Robyn Orlin, a renowned South African choreographer honoured with the Olivier Award for Outstanding Achievement, and performed by dancers of Moving Into Dance Mophatong, a flagship contemporary dance company, together with an electronic duo in South Africa. Featuring high-energy dance and a colourful stage, this piece pays homage to the Zulu rickshaw drivers who demonstrate resilience and creativity in adversity.

 Orlin is globally revered for her bold theatricality and concepts. Her work, ""We wear our wheels with pride"", has received widespread acclaim when staged in Europe. The programme is inspired by the rickshaw drivers once seen on the streets in South Africa who adorned themselves with tunics decorated with pearls and fringes, feathered headdresses and flamboyant cow horns. They painted their rickshaws with vibrant colours and pulled them with a bouncy, dance-like gait. Orlin reimagines the scenes on stage, captivating audiences with a stunning visual feast.

 Moving Into Dance Mophatong inherits Zulu traditions, with both body language and visual elements rooted in the tribe's heritage. Blending traditional and contemporary techniques, the dancers narrate the enduring history of Africa with powerful and fluid body movements. In the performance, dancers' silhouettes are instantly projected onto giant screens, morphing into swirling, multi-coloured hues that reflect the Rainbow Nation's spirit.

 The live music is created by two South African musicians Annalyzer (Anelisa Stuurman) and Yogin Sullaphen, who fuse Khoisan chants and slam poetry with electronic beats, hip hop and Afrofusion, evolving into a unique soundtrack that perfectly complements the visuals.

 ""We wear our wheels with pride"" will be held at 8pm on October 18 and 3pm on October 19 at the Sheung Wan Civic Centre Theatre. Tickets priced at $360 and $480 are now available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288, or use the mobile ticketing app ""URBTIX"".

 The programme contains strobe lighting effects. Songs will be performed in IsiXhosa, IsiZulu, Sesotho and English. Audience members may be filmed, and the footage will be used as part of the performance. A meet-the-artist session will be held after the performance on October 18.

 In addition, an outreach performance by dancers of Moving into Dance Mophatong will be held on October 17 at 7.30pm at the Main Entrance, 1/F, Central Market. Admission is free. A dance and music workshop will also be held at 8pm on the same day at the Rehearsal Hall, 7/F, Sheung Wan Civic Centre. The ticket price is $220. For details, please refer to www.asiaplus.gov.hk/2025/en/wwowwp.

 The Asia+ Festival is held annually from September to November with the aim of creating a sustainable platform for arts and cultural exchange. While focusing on Asia, the Festival also connects with Belt and Road countries and regions in Europe, Africa and the Americas. Now in its third edition, artists from more than 30 countries and regions, including 12 new participating countries, will take part in the Festival, featuring over 100 performances and activities.

「非躍舞蹈團」的風格繼承祖魯傳統，肢體語言和視覺元素皆植根於該部落文化。舞者結合傳統和現代技巧，以強烈而靈活的身體律動，演繹深厚悠久的非洲歷史。在節目中，舞者的身影即時投影在大屏幕上，幻化成自由飛舞的七彩雲霞，映照出南非這彩虹國度的精神面貌。

節目的現場音樂由兩位南非音樂家Annalyzer（Anelisa Stuurman）與 Yogin Sullaphen 攜手創作，他們巧妙地將科伊桑族的吟唱和詩歌、融合電子音樂、嘻哈和非洲融合音樂，發展成獨一無二的音樂語言，完美襯托台上色彩豐富的影像。

《我們腳踏無敵風火輪》於十月十八日晚上八時及十月十九日下午三時，在上環文娛中心劇院上演，票價分為360元及480元，門票現於城市售票網（www.urbtix.hk）發售；電話購票請致電3166 1288；或使用流動購票應用程式URBTIX。

Among the sixth batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering nine survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering seven survey areas in September, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released six batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in September 2025, covering 58 survey areas. Among these 58 survey areas, 49 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. August 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation had improved or maintained a low level. Nine other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:


tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

九月份第六批涵蓋九個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及七個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年九月共六批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共58個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年八月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這58個監察區中，49個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有九區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：


收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

  The Financial Secretary, under the authority delegated by the Chief Executive pursuant to the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council Ordinance (Cap. 588), has reappointed Mr Roger Thomas Best, Mr Stephen Hung Wan-shun and Ms Miranda Kwok Pui-fong as Non-executive Directors (NEDs) of the AFRC for a term of one year from October 1, 2025, to September 30, 2026; reappointed Mr Andrew Fung Hau-chung, Dr James C Lin and Mr Edward Yuen Siu-bun as NEDs of the AFRC for a term of two years from October 1, 2025, to September 30, 2027; and newly appointed Ms Clara Chan Yuen-shan, Ms Cindi Hui Ming-ming and Mr Charles Lip Sai-wo as NEDs of the AFRC for a term of two years from October 1, 2025, to September 30, 2027.

  Announcing the appointments, a spokesman for the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau said, ""Since the launch of the new regulatory regime of the accounting profession in 2022, the AFRC Board has been steering the orderly discharge of its various regulatory powers over accounting professionals and practice units. As three new NEDs from a diverse professional background are coming onboard, we are confident that the AFRC will continue to strive for the effective regulation and sustainable development of Hong Kong's accounting profession.""

  The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau would also like to express its heartfelt gratitude to Mr Eugene Fung Ting-sek, Mr Stephen Lee Hoi-yin, Ms Rosita Lee Pui-shan, Mr Francis Siu Wai-keung and Dr Peter Wan Kam-to for their dedicated services and valuable contributions to the AFRC as NEDs since October 2019.

  Upon the commencement of the new regulatory regime of the accounting profession on October 1, 2022, the AFRC has become a full-fledged independent regulatory and oversight body of the accounting profession with expanded statutory functions of, inter alia, registration, inspection, investigation and discipline. It is also responsible for promoting and supporting the development of the accounting profession, as well as overseeing the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants' performance of various statutory professional functions."
CHP announces new melioidosis case,2025-09-26 16:30,2025-09-26 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600656.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 26) announced that one new melioidosis case was recorded in the past week (September 19 to 25). The CHP appealed to members of the public to maintain personal and environmental hygiene to prevent melioidosis infection. The CHP also specifically reminded high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water after typhoons or storms with a view to lowering infection risk.

 The case involves an 83-year-old female with underlying illnesses who lives in Sham Shui Po. She presented with fever and cough since September 14. The following day, she attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Caritas Medical Centreand was admitted for treatment. The clinical diagnosis waspneumonia. She is in stable condition.Her clinical sample was confirmed to be positive for Burkholderia pseudomallei upon testing.

 The CHP is investigating the infection source of the case. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing.

 As of September 25, 11 melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded.

 Person-to-person transmission and animal-to-human transmission are rare, but the bacteria causing melioidosis can survive in the local environment. Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong, and melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year.

 According to literature, melioidosis cases are more common after typhoons or rainstorms. The bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei in soil and muddy water may become exposed to the ground after typhoons or rainstorms, and the bacteria could spread more easily with strong winds or rainstorms. As such, the number of melioidosis cases may increase.

 With this in mind, where practicable, members of the public should stay indoors during typhoons and rainstorms, avoid travelling to areas with potential flooding, and do not wade in or have contact with muddy water and soil. In addition, high-risk individuals should avoid paths near stormwater drains where aerosols may be generated from contaminated water.

 Members of the public should also take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. using gloves and wearing boots. High-risk individuals may also consider wearing a surgical mask;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover them with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soil or gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.

 â
 âThe CHP appealed to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromising conditions, in order to receive an appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment. For more information on melioidosis, please visit the website of the CHP atwww.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html."

衞生防護中心公布新增一宗類鼻疽個案,2025-09-26 16:30,2025-09-26 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600654.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月二十六日）表示，過去一星期（九月十九日至二十五日），中心錄得一宗新增類鼻疽個案。中心呼籲市民保持個人及環境衞生，預防感染類鼻疽，並特別提醒高風險群組，包括長者及長期病患者，在颱風或暴雨後應避免接觸土壤或泥水，減低感染風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的83歲女子。她居於深水埗，自九月十四日出現發燒和咳嗽，翌日到明愛醫院急症室求診，並入院接受治療，臨床診斷為肺炎。現時情況穩定。她的臨床樣本經化驗證實對類鼻疽伯克氏菌呈陽性反應。

中心正調查個案的感染源頭和進行流行病學調查。

截至九月二十五日，本港今年錄得11宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。

導致類鼻疽的病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可存活於本地環境。類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得類鼻疽個案。

根據文獻，類鼻疽個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令病菌更容易散播，從而令類鼻疽個案有機會增加。

就此，颱風和暴雨期間市民應盡量留在室內，避免前往可能出現水浸的地區，亦不應涉水或接觸泥水和泥土。同時，高風險人士應避免使用雨水渠道附近的道路，以免接觸可能由污水產生的氣溶膠。

市民亦應採取以下措施預防感染：

• 避免接觸受污染的土壤；
• 進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿着適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴，高風險人士可考慮額外佩戴外科口罩；
• 接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
• 盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
• 接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
• 注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
• 外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。就更多有關類鼻疽的資料，市民可參閱中心網站www.chp.gov.hk/tc/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html。"

Chief Executive in Council approves financial arrangements for Smart and Green Mass Transit System in Kai Tak,2025-09-26 16:00,2025-09-26 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600432.htm,"The Government announced today (September 26) that the Chief Executive in Council had approved the financial arrangements for the Smart and Green Mass Transit System (SGMTS) in Kai Tak (Kai Tak Project).

A Government spokesman said, ""With a strong determination to break new ground, we have been working resolutely to introduce the SGMTSs into Hong Kong through a 'dual innovation' thinking on policy and technology. To expedite project delivery, enhance cost effectiveness, and leverage the expertise and financial capability of the private sector, the Government will implement a number of innovative measures.

""Firstly, we will encourage the entry of new local, Mainland and overseas investors and operators by selecting a franchisee to finance, design, construct, operate and maintain each new system through an open tender, which can enhance competition and bring in innovative thinking in the provision of public transport services. The anticipated operating cost for the SGMTS is lower than that for heavy rail, and thus a fiscal balance or even a profit can be achieved in its operation. Nevertheless, the estimated profit from the operation of the SGMTS would normally not be able to cover the substantive capital investment, such as initial construction costs, etc. In this connection, we plan to provide funding support through a transit-oriented development (TOD) approach, where property development rights of TOD sites in the vicinity of the SGMTSs would be granted to the franchisees of the SGMTSs for holistic planning and development. This approach could unleash the development potential of the concerned sites, achieve synergy of the transit systems and property development, and enhance the business case.

""Secondly, we will introduce a new technology-neutral, common and standardised regulatory framework through legislation to provide the statutory backing for granting and regulating franchises of these systems. It is anticipated that the new legislation could shorten the lead time and allow flexibility for the Government to swiftly grasp the opportunities brought about by technological breakthroughs. Our target is to introduce the said bill into the Legislative Council within 2026.

""Thirdly, we will adopt a set of streamlined building control procedures and set up a dedicated interdepartmental one-stop platform, such that the franchisees and the relevant departments could deliberate on the design, construction and operation aspects at an early project stage, saving the franchisees' effort to seek comments and approvals from each authority individually, with a view to expediting the entire approval process.""

The Chief Executive in Council approved that property development rights of Sites 4B5, 4C4 and 4C5 in Kai Tak should be granted by way of private treaty grants at nominal premiums to the franchisee to be selected through open tender to provide funding support for the Kai Tak Project. The proposed alignment of the Kai Tak Project and location plan of the abovementioned three Sites are at the Annex. The Government will invite tenders for the Kai Tak Project shortly, in which tenderers will be required to propose in their financial proposals a fixed sum payable to the Government for the grant of the SGMTS franchise and property development rights of the Sites.

The Government plans to award the tender for the Kai Tak Project in 2026 for commissioning in 2031.

The Government plans to adopt an approach similar to that for the Kai Tak Project in taking forward the SGMTS projects in East Kowloon and Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen and Yuen Long South New Development Areas, with a target to invite tenders for the respective franchises within 2026."

「第一，我們會透過公開招標方式甄選專營公司負責融資、設計、建造、營運和維修新系統，鼓勵本地、內地及海外的新投資者及營運商參與，加強競爭，為公共交通服務帶來創新思維。新系統項目預期營運成本較重型鐵路低而能達至收支平衡或有盈利，但其預期營運利潤一般不足以涵蓋前期建設等的大量資本投入。因此，我們建議以『公共運輸導向發展』模式提供財務資助。透過授予項目專營公司系統沿線用地的物業發展權進行全盤規劃及發展，可以釋放相關用地的發展潛力，使物業發展與運輸項目能產生協同效應，提升商機。」

「第二，我們會透過立法引入一套技術中立、通用且標準化的全新規管框架，為授予和監管各個新集體運輸系統的專營權提供法定基礎，預期能縮短引進新系統的籌備時間，容讓我們能迅速把握創新技術帶來的機遇。我們的目標是於二○二六年內向立法會提交法案。」

「第三，我們亦會應用簡化的建築物管制程序和設立一站式專責跨部門平台，讓項目的專營公司與相關部門在項目推展初期起已共同商議設計、建造和營運事宜，減省專營公司向不同部門尋求意見和批准所需要的時間，加快整個審批流程。」

行政長官會同行政會議批准，以私人協約方式及象徵式地價向透過公開招標甄選的專營公司批出啟德第4B區5號、第4C區4號及第4C區5號用地的物業發展權為啟德項目提供財務資助。啟德項目的擬議走線及上述三幅用地的位置圖載於附件。政府會在短期內就啟德項目公開招標，投標者須在其標書的財務建議書中建議一筆向政府支付的固定金額以換取系統專營權及該些用地的物業發展權。

政府預計於明年內批出啟德項目合約，二○三一年通車。

政府計劃透過類似啟德項目的方式推展東九龍和洪水橋／厦村及元朗南新發展區的智慧綠色集體運輸系統項目，目標於二○二六年就這兩個項目各自的專營權招標。"

一名三十六歲男旅客昨日從泰國曼谷飛抵本港。海關人員替他進行清關時，在其攜同的寄艙行李內發現該批懷疑大麻花，遂把該名男子拘捕。

被捕男子已被控以一項販運危險藥物罪，案件明日（九月二十七日）在九龍城裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。

海關會繼續根據風險管理的原則，重點揀選來自高風險地區的旅客作清關檢查，確保有效打擊跨境販毒活動。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。

Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected cannabis buds at airport (with photo),2025-09-26 15:45,2025-09-26 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600695.htm,"Hong Kong Customs yesterday (September 25) detected a drug trafficking case involving baggage concealment at Hong Kong International Airport and seized about 15 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with an estimated market value of about $3.3 million.

A 36-year-old male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds in the check-in suitcase possessed by him. The man was subsequently arrested.

The arrested man has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (September 27).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
過渡性房屋丙類租戶接受申請,2025-09-26 15:40,2025-09-26 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600508.htm,"​配合「簡樸房」規管制度的落實，有迫切短暫安置需要的分間單位住戶可以申請成為過渡性房屋的丙類租戶。丙類租戶將於二○二五年十月三日起開始接受申請。

房屋局發言人表示：「《簡樸房條例草案》已於今日（九月二十六日）經立法會三讀通過。《簡樸房條例》將於十月三日刊憲，並在二○二六年三月一日生效。因應『簡樸房』規管制度於二○二六年三月一日開始推行，有分間單位住戶可能會因分間單位需要進行改造工程以取得『簡樸房』認證，或政府於為期十二個月的登記期完結後（即二○二七年三月一日起）開展的執法行動而受影響，當中部分住戶未必能夠在短時間內尋覓其他合適的居所。若有關住戶符合申請『簡約公屋』或過渡性房屋的資格，正在及陸續落成的多個項目可以為他們提供充足的住屋選擇。儘管如此，我們理解部分住戶現時未能符合相關申請資格，例如入息／資產超額，因此我們會在十月三日起在過渡性房屋新增丙類租戶類別，為日後受『簡樸房』規管制度相關的改造工程或執法行動影響，並且有迫切短暫安置需要的分間單位住戶提供協助。」

丙類租戶申請人可獲放寬過渡性房屋的現行入息／資產限額，但仍須符合其他申請資格（包括申請人必須年滿18歲；申請者及／或其家庭成員必須現居香港並擁有香港入境權；及並無擁有或與他人共同擁有香港／中國內地／海外任何住宅物業或該類物業的任何權益等）。另外，丙類租戶申請人及／或其家庭成員須在分間單位連續居住滿六個月或以上，並須提供有效證明文件，透過房屋局委聘的六支區域服務隊進行審核，以證明其安置需要。

六支區域服務隊除了會為有需要的分間單位住戶就過渡性房屋丙類租戶的申請進行審核，亦會繼續在地區層面推廣分間單位租務管制和日後的「簡樸房」規管制度，並繼續向分間單位住戶提供支援。如有需要，可透過以下途徑與相關區域服務隊聯絡︰

發言人補充：「在過渡性房屋新增丙類租戶類別的目的是在有需要的分間單位住戶尋覓到合適的長期居所前，向他們提供短暫安置的居所。我們預計部分丙類租戶在遷入過渡性房屋後不久便可覓得合適的長期居所（例如經改造後獲認證為『簡樸房』的分間單位），入住過渡性房屋的時間不會太長，因此丙類租戶的租約將會具備一定彈性，租期以每月計算，最短為一個月，而最長一般不得多於兩年。為確保珍貴的房屋資源不被濫用，丙類租戶的租金將採取三級制。簡單而言，丙類租戶在居住首十二個月，租金為該項目的原有租金。他們入住十二個月後可申請兩次延長居住期。第一次延長居住期，即入住後的第十三至第十八個月，經營運機構評估後，仍有迫切住屋需要的丙類租戶可獲准延長租約六個月，但需支付一倍半的租金。第二次延長居住期，即入住後的第十九至第二十四個月，經營運機構評估後，仍有迫切住屋需要的丙類租戶可再次獲准延長租約六個月，但需支付雙倍租金。另外，居住期僅一至六個月的丙類租戶，可能需向有關營運機構繳交一筆額外的清潔／行政費（惟該費用不會超過有關單位的半個月租金）。」

經區域服務隊完成丙類租戶的審核後，丙類租戶申請人可透過房屋局網站進入「住得易」—過渡性房屋中央統一平台提交申請；或填妥供丙類租戶專用的過渡性房屋入住申請表格後，經上述平台上載遞交，或以郵寄（郵政總局郵政信箱183號房屋局過渡性房屋專責小組）、傳真（3565 4382）、電郵（thapp@hb.gov.hk）等方式遞交表格。申請表格可於上述網站下載，或向各區域服務隊索取。

Category C tenants of transitional housing open for application,2025-09-26 15:40,2025-09-26 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600509.htm,"âIn tandem with the implementation of the Basic Housing Unit (BHU) regulatory regime, residents of subdivided units (SDUs) with imminent short-term rehousing needs can apply for transitional housing (TH) as Category C tenants. Category C tenants will be open for application from October 3, 2025.

""The Basic Housing Units Bill was passed by the Legislative Council at its third reading today (September 26). The Basic Housing Units Ordinance will be gazetted on October 3 and come into effect on March 1, 2026. In view of the implementation of the BHU regulatory regime starting from March 1, 2026, SDU residents may be affected due to the need for alteration works in SDUs for obtaining BHU recognition, or the enforcement actions carried out by the Government upon expiry of the 12-month registration period (i.e. from March 1, 2027). Some of these residents may not be able to identify suitable accommodation within a short period of time. If the residents concerned are eligible to apply for Light Public Housing or TH, the projects which are currently in operation and coming on stream can provide them with sufficient accommodation options. However, we understand that some residents may not fulfil the relevant prevailing application requirements, e.g. income/asset exceeding the limits. Therefore, we will create a new type of Category C tenants for TH starting from October 3, in order to provide assistance to those SDU residents affected by alteration works or enforcement actions under the BHU regulatory regime in future and have imminent short-term rehousing needs,"" a spokesman for the Housing Bureau (HB) said.

Applicants for Category C tenants can be exempted from meeting the prevailing income/asset limits for TH, but they still need to meet other eligibility requirements (including the applicants must be 18 years of age or above; the applicants and/or their family member(s) must be residing in Hong Kong and have the right to land in Hong Kong; and must not own or co-own or have an interest in any domestic property in Hong Kong/Chinese Mainland/overseas, etc). In addition, the applicant for Category C tenants and/or his/her family member(s) must have lived in SDUs consecutively for at least six months, and provide valid documentary proof for review by any of the six District Service Teams (DSTs) commissioned by the HB to prove their rehousing needs.

Apart from reviewing the applications for Category C tenants of TH from SDU residents in need, the six DSTs will also continue to promote SDU tenancy control and the future BHU regulatory regime at the district level, as well as to provide support to SDU residents. If needed, the relevant DSTs can be contacted through the following channels:

â""The objective of creating Category C tenants for TH is to provide short-term accommodation for SDU residents in need before they identify suitable long-term accommodation. We anticipate that some Category C tenants may be able to identify suitable long-term accommodation soon after moving into TH (e.g. SDUs which have obtained BHU recognition upon completion of alteration works) and will not live in TH for a long time. Therefore, there will be a certain degree of flexibility in the tenancy for Category C tenants, which will be set on a monthly basis, with the shortest being one month and the longest generally not exceeding two years. A three-tier rental arrangement will be adopted for Category C tenants to prevent the precious housing resources from being abused. In short, Category C tenants shall pay the original rent of the TH project in the first 12 months of residence. Upon completion of the 12-month residence, they may apply for two extensions. For the first extension (i.e. 13th to 18th month of residence), upon assessment by the operating organisation, Category C tenants who are still in imminent rehousing need may be granted a six-month extension of lease, but they will be required to pay 1.5 times the rent. For the second extension (i.e. 19th to 24th month of residence), upon assessment by the operating organisation, Category C tenants who are still in imminent rehousing need may be granted a further six-month extension of lease, but they will be required to pay double rent. In addition, Category C tenants with residence of only one to six months may be required to pay an additional cleaning/administration fee to the relevant operating organisation, although this fee will not exceed half a month's rent for the relevant unit,"" the spokesman added.

Upon completion of review of Category C tenants by DSTs, applicants for Category C tenants can submit their applications through ""TH-E"" - Central and Unified Platform for TH via the HB's website; or complete the TH application form exclusively for Category C tenants and then upload it to the above-mentioned platform, or submit it by post (Task Force on Transitional Housing, Housing Bureau, P.O. Box 183, General Post Office), fax (3565 4382), email (thapp@hb.gov.hk), etc. The application form can be downloaded from the above-mentioned website or obtained from the DSTs.

For information on the application for TH, please visit the HB's website www.hb.gov.hk/eng/policy/housing/policy/transitional/tenantapplications.html. For any enquiries, please contact the Task Force on Transitional Housing under the HB (Tel: 3611 8156; email: thapp@hb.gov.hk).  "

Hong Kong Customs conducts interdepartmental anti-illicit cigarette publicity activities in Kwun Tong District (with photos),2025-09-26 15:30,2025-09-26 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600421.htm,"Hong Kong Customs conducted a joint anti-illicit cigarette publicity campaign with members of the Kwun Tong District Council, the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the Department of Health, the Housing Department and the Community Care Teamat On Tat Estate in Kwun Tong today (September 26).

Customs officers distributed promotional items to residents at the estate and introduced to them the latest amendments to illicit cigarette-related legislation as well as Customs' enforcement actions against illicit cigarettes.

The Government gazetted the Tobacco Control Legislation (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 on September 19 to make amendments to the existing legislation for the implementation of a new phase of tobacco control measures. The enhanced penalties and enforcement measures for duty-not-paid tobacco offences have come into effect on the same day:


Increase the penalty for offences of failing to declare dutiable goods, including tobacco and alcoholic liquor, to Customs Officers compoundable under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) from $2,000 to $5,000;
Raise the maximum penalty for engaging in illicit cigarettes activities from a $1 million fine and two-year imprisonment to a $2 million fine and seven-year imprisonment;and
List the relevant offences under Schedule 1 to the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance to enhance the investigation and enforcement powers of Customs for combating illicit cigarette activities, including applying to the court to confiscate crime proceeds and to enhance sentencing.


Customs will continue its risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as through its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storage, distribution and peddling to spare no effort in combating illicit cigarette activities. Also, Customs will strengthen publicity and education to remind the public not to take part in unlawful acts related to illicit cigarettes.

Under the DCO, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years. Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002).

In accordance with the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Cap. 371), no person shall distribute any smoking product advertisement (including any promotional leaflets). Any person who contravenes the regulation is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000. Members of the public may report any suspected activities of illicit cigarette leaflets distribution to TACO's hotline 2961 8823."
Interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements releases latest information on cross-boundary passenger traffic estimation and arrangements for National Day Golden Week of Mainland,2025-09-26 15:30,2025-09-26 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600692.htm,"  The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration released the following information today (September 26) on the latest situation and arrangements for the upcoming National Day Golden Week of the Mainland.

  During the upcoming National Day Golden Week of the Mainland (October 1 to 8), the Immigration Department (ImmD) estimates that around 8.76 million passengers (including Hong Kong residents and visitors) will pass through Hong Kong's sea, land and air control points. The ImmD, in consultation with the Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection and other Mainland authorities, estimates that around 7.52 million passengers will pass through land boundary control points. The number of outbound and inbound passengers using land boundary control points will be relatively higher on October 4 (Saturday) and October 1 (Wednesday), with around 660 000 passengers and 610 000 passengers respectively.

  The ImmD estimates that the passenger traffic at the Lo Wu Control Point, the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point and the Shenzhen Bay Control Point will be heavy, with a daily average forecast of about 240 000, 220 000 and 140 000 passengers respectively.

  To cope with the anticipated heavy traffic during the festive period, the ImmD has minimised leave for frontline officers for flexible deployment and the operation of extra clearance counters and kiosks.

  Furthermore, the ImmD, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Customs and Excise Department and the MTR Corporation Limited will set up a joint command centre at the Lo Wu Control Point to make necessary arrangements. The ImmD will also establish close communication with Mainland authorities, including the Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection. To ensure a smooth passenger traffic flow, passenger conditions will be closely monitored and appropriate traffic diversion plans will be adopted when necessary.

  The ImmD advises all land boundary passengers to plan in advance, avoid making their journeys during busy periods and keep track of radio and TV broadcasts on traffic conditions at various control points. Residents and visitors may also visit ""Easy Boundary"" (www.sb.gov.hk/eng/bwt/status.html?type=outbound), a one-stop information platform on immigration clearance launched by the Security Bureau, to obtain useful information in one go, including the respective average waiting time for passengers and private cars at land boundary control points, as well as for the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge cross-boundary shuttle bus (Gold Bus) and the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) to plan their trips and save waiting time.

  For travellers making journeys to the Mainland, the ImmD reminds them to carry their proof of identity and valid travel documents for crossing the boundary. Hong Kong residents should also check the validity of their Home Visit Permits. Non-permanent residents must carry their valid smart identity card as well as their Document of Identity for Visa Purposes or valid travel document.

  Holders of the acknowledgement receipt issued due to the reported loss or replacement of their Hong Kong identity cards, or children under 11 years old who hold Hong Kong identity cards, should carry a valid travel document or Re-entry Permit.

  About 700 e-Channels have been installed at various control points. To further enhance the clearance efficiency of control points and allow more Hong Kong residents to use the fast and convenient e-Channel service, the ImmD has adjusted the applicable age for e-Channel service for holders of smart identity cards. Eligible Hong Kong permanent residents aged 7 to 10 years old, who are at least 1.1 metres tall and hold a smart identity card and a valid Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Passport, can use the e-Channels without prior enrolment for self-service immigration clearance via face recognition technology at all control points. Moreover, the Contactless e-Channel service is available at all control points now. All eligible Hong Kong residents, after enrolment, can generate an encrypted QR code through the Contactless e-Channel mobile application to enter the e-Channel and then verify their identity with the facial verification technology for automated immigration clearance.

  In addition, the ImmD has extended the e-Channel service to holders of a valid People's Republic of China (PRC) electronic ordinary passport aged 11 or above and are in transit through Hong Kong to and from another country or territory. Eligible PRC passport holders can use the e-Channel service when entering Hong Kong without prior enrolment for e-Channel service via face recognition technology.

特區政府節慶安排跨部門工作小組發放最新資訊：內地國慶黃金周期間經陸路往返內地的旅客流量預測及有關安排,2025-09-26 15:30,2025-09-26 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600681.htm,"由政務司司長領導的節慶安排跨部門工作小組今日（九月二十六日），就今年內地國慶黃金周期間的旅客流量估算及安排，發放以下最新資訊：

今年內地國慶黃金周期間（即十月一日至十月八日），入境事務處（入境處）預計約有876萬人次（包括香港居民及訪客）經各海、陸、空管制站進出香港。經入境處與深圳出入境邊防檢查總站（邊檢總站）等內地部門協商後，預計約有752萬人次會經各陸路邊境管制站進出香港。陸路出境較為繁忙的日子為十月四日（星期六），出境人次約66萬，而入境高峰期為十月一日（星期三），入境人次約61萬。

入境處估計假期期間羅湖管制站、落馬洲支線管制站及深圳灣管制站將會非常繁忙，預計每日平均分別約有24萬、22萬及14萬人次出入境。

為疏導假期期間的旅客流量，入境處已減少前線人員休假，以便彈性調配人手，加開檢查櫃枱及通道以疏導人流及車流。

另一方面，入境處亦會連同香港警務處、香港海關和香港鐵路有限公司在羅湖管制站成立聯合指揮中心，以作出相應的部署及採取適當措施，並與深圳邊檢總站等內地部門緊密聯繫，密切留意人流情況及在有需要時採取適當分流疏導措施，確保過關人流暢順。

入境處呼籲所有經陸路往返內地的旅客應預早計劃行程，盡量避免選擇在繁忙時段過關，並留意有關各邊境管制站交通情況的電台或電視廣播。市民及旅客亦可瀏覽保安局推出的一站式過關資訊平台「口岸通」（www.sb.gov.hk/chi/bwt/status.html?type=outbound），一次過取得各陸路邊境管制站旅客和私家車過關平均輪候時間，以及港珠澳大橋過境穿梭巴士（金巴）和落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）的平均輪候時間等有用資訊，以便計劃行程及減省等候時間。

入境處呼籲旅客在過關前往內地時，應緊記帶備身分證明文件及前往內地的有效旅行證件。香港居民出門前應檢查回鄉卡的有效日期，而香港非永久性居民則須帶同其有效的智能身份證及簽證身份書或旅行證件過關。

至於因遺失或補領身份證而獲發申請香港身份證收據的市民，或未滿十一歲而已領有香港身份證的兒童，他們應同時帶備有效的旅行證件或回港證過關。

現時入境處已在各管制站裝設約700條e-道。為進一步提升管制站的通關效率，讓更多的香港居民使用便捷的e-道服務，入境處已調整智能身份證持有人使用e-道服務的適用年齡，七歲至十歲及身高達1.1米或以上的香港永久性居民只要持有智能身份證和有效的香港特別行政區護照，無須預先登記便可在各管制站使用e-道服務，以容貌識別技術自助辦理出入境檢查手續。另外，「非觸式e-道」服務現已經擴展至所有管制站，已登記的合資格香港居民可透過「非觸式e-道」手機應用程式產生加密二維碼進入e-道，再配合容貌識別技術核實身分自助辦理出入境檢查手續。

此外，入境處已擴展e-道服務至持有有效的中華人民共和國電子普通護照及經香港過境往來另一國家或地區的十一歲或以上人士。合資格的中國護照持有人可以免登記在入境時使用e-道服務，利用容貌識別技術自助辦理入境手續。同時，各管制站已向訪港旅客提供更方便的自助離境服務「離境易」。這項服務採用容貌識別技術核實訪港旅客的身分，讓合資格並持有電子旅行證件的訪港旅客經「離境易」e-道辦理自助離境手續，無須預先登記。

香港居民在外旅遊時如需協助，可致電入境處「協助在外香港居民小組」的24小時求助熱線，電話：（852）1868；透過入境處流動應用程式以網絡數據致電「1868」熱線或使用1868聊天機械人；發送訊息至1868 WhatsApp求助熱線或1868微信求助熱線；或提交網上求助表格求助。

節慶安排跨部門工作小組負責全面統籌並督導各政府部門有關內地國慶黃金周期間接待訪港旅客的預備工作，以及加強資訊發布，方便市民及旅客按最新情況規劃行程。"

海關人員向居民派發宣傳品，介紹私煙相關法例的最新修訂及海關打擊私煙的工作。

政府九月十九日在憲報刊登《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例》，透過修訂現有法例，實施新一階段控煙措施。當中，提高未完稅煙草相關罪行的罰則及執法措施同日起生效：


在《應課稅品條例》下，就攜帶煙酒等應課稅品入境而未有向海關人員作出申報的罪行，作有代價地不予檢控的罰則由2,000元提高至5,000元；
未完稅煙草相關罪行最高罰則由罰款100萬元及監禁兩年，提高至罰款200萬元及監禁七年；及
把有關罪行列入《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》附表1，加強海關對打擊私煙活動的調查及執法權力，包括向法庭申請沒收犯罪得益的權力及判處更高刑罰。


海關會繼續根據風險評估和情報分析從源頭堵截，並透過針對貯存及分銷販賣多管齊下的執法策略，致力打擊私煙活動。海關亦會加強宣傳教育，提醒市民切勿參與有關私煙的違法行為。

根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。

根據《吸煙（公眾衞生）條例》（第371章），任何人不得分發任何形式的吸煙產品廣告（包括任何傳單），違例者最高可被罰款港幣五萬元。市民可致電衞生署控煙酒辦公室熱線2961 8823舉報懷疑派發私煙傳單活動。"

The Garden of Remembrance at Shek Mun is the 14th facility of this type managed by the FEHD. The ""Garden of Forever Love"" is the third in Hong Kong established for this purpose, following those at Wo Hop Shek and Cape Collinson."
