Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-17 23:20,2025-12-17 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700887.htm,"âThe three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

 For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3.5 billion as of noon today (December 17). With the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.8 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

 The Government earlier announced that a living allowance from the Support Fund will be provided to each affected household, and the amount has been increased from $50,000 to $100,000. As of today, 1 917 cases have been processed. In addition, the Government will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 134 cases have been processed. The allowance will be disbursed in phases.

 Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 980 affected households, providing the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service to more than 4 900 residents. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

 As of this morning, a total of 632 residents are staying in hotel rooms through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, and 548 residents are staying in youth hostels/camps. Another 3 439 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau, units from the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) or Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun.

 Currently, there is still an abundant supply of more than 1 000 units that can provide affected residents with longer term accommodation. The transitional housing and HKHS projects in different districts can altogether provide around 400 units at the moment. Besides, Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun and Runway 1331 at Kai Tak can provide a supply of around 900 units.

 Besides, the Housing Bureau and the Transport Department have been working closely with the operating organisations and public transport service providers to deploy additional vehicles and manpower to support affected residents who have been admitted into transitional housing and HKHS projects in various districts and to cater for residents' commuting needs. Among the projects, an additional residents' service (RS) NR540 to and from Good House in Tai Po and Tai Po Market Station, as well as shuttle bus services connecting Good House, Tai Po Centre and Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital have been launched; the existing RS NR50 to and from Trackside Villas in Tai Po and Tai Po Market Station has been enhanced; a supplementary RS NR976 has been introduced connecting The STEP in Yuen Long and Tai Po Market Station.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

  Thesupplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 900 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, over 25 000 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Regulation and inspection work
----------------------------------

 The Independent Checking Unit of the Housing Bureau and the Housing Department will continue to deploy manpower in Wang Fuk Court to assist the removal of items such as scaffolding and protective nets at some of the affected buildings so as to facilitate the evidence collection by the Police."
CHP announces investigation progress on Legionnaires' disease case,2025-12-17 22:56,2025-12-17 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700873.htm,"âThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) previously announced a Legionnaires' disease (LD) case involving a 45-year-old female. Based on further investigation findings, the CHP today (December 17) announced that the possibility of a nosocomial infection cannot be ruled out. The CHP has instructed the hospital concerned, St Paul's Hospital, to thoroughly disinfect the water system on the relevant floor. No other patients who stayed on the same floor developed symptoms of LD so far.

The female patient concerned had underlying illness and was immunosuppressed. She was admitted to a private room at St Paul's Hospital on November 19 for treatment of her underlying illness and was discharged on November 26. She was readmitted to the same hospital on November 28 for the same underlying illness. After re-admission, she developed a fever and her chest X-ray showed symptoms of pneumonia. Her respiratory specimen collected on December 2 tested positive for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. The patient's condition subsequently deteriorated and she succumbed on December 6 due to her underlying illness.

As the patient had stayed in the community and hospitalised at St Paul's Hospital during the incubation period, the CHP conducted environmental investigations at her residence and the hospital to investigate the source of infection. On December 5, the CHP and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department collected water and environmental samples at the hospital. A total of 24 water samples were collected from wards of the floor where the patient was admitted between November 19 to 26. Upon laboratory testing by the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the CHP, 16 samples tested positive for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 at levels ranging from 0.9 to 7.3 colony-forming units per millilitre (cfu/ml), exceeding the action level for water supply systems in high-risk areas of hospitals (i.e. 0.1 cfu/ml or above). All 12 environmental samples tested negative.

The CHP also collected water and environmental samples from the patient's residence. Relevant laboratory testing is ongoing.

Taking into account the length of the patient's hospital stay, onset date and preliminary test results, the possibility of a nosocomial infection cannot be ruled out at this stage.

The patient had no household contacts. The CHP placed 28 patients admitted to the same floor concerned since mid-November under medical surveillance. No additional LD cases have been identified among the patients so far. All have been discharged.

St Paul's Hospital has closed and suspended use of the wards on the floor concerned and will thoroughly disinfect the water supply system on that floor as instructed by the CHP. Investigation is ongoing. The CHP has provided health advice and medical surveillance recommendations to the hospital, and will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the measures and conduct epidemiological investigations.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpool spas, water fountains, humidifiers and home respiratory devices that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

 The public may visit the CHP'sLD page, theCode of Practice for Prevention of LDand theHousekeeping Guidelines for Cold and Hot Water Systems for Building Managementof the Prevention of LD Committee, and the CHP'srisk-based strategyfor prevention and control of LD."
衞生防護中心公布一宗退伍軍人病個案的調查進展,2025-12-17 21:50,2025-12-17 22:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700740.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）早前公布一宗涉及一名45歲女病人的退伍軍人病個案，今日（十二月十七日）因應進一步調查結果，不排除病人屬院內感染個案的可能性，已指示涉事的聖保祿醫院徹底消毒相關樓層的供水系統，暫時沒有其他入住同一樓層的病人出現退伍軍人病病徵。

涉事女病人有長期病患及免疫力弱，於十一月十九日因自身疾病入住聖保祿醫院一間單人病房接受治療，並於十一月二十六日出院。她於十一月二十八日因自身疾病再度入住該院。她入院後出現發燒，胸部X光片亦顯示她有肺炎徵狀。她於十二月二日採集的呼吸道樣本對嗜肺性退伍軍人桿菌血清1型呈陽性反應。病人其後情況轉差，並因自身疾病於十二月六日病逝。

由於病人在潛伏期內曾分別在社區活動及入住聖保祿醫院，中心已對其住所及聖保祿醫院進行環境調查，以查找感染源頭。中心於十二月五日聯同機電工程署到該院採集水及環境樣本。在她於十一月十九日至二十六日期間入住的樓層的病房共採集了24個水樣本，經中心公共衞生化驗服務處化驗後，其中16個樣本經化驗後對嗜肺性退伍軍人桿菌血清1型呈陽性反應，濃度為每毫升0.9至7.3個菌落形成單位，高於醫院高風險區供水系統的行動水平（即每毫升0.1個或以上菌落形成單位）。另外12個環境樣本則全部呈陰性反應。

中心亦已在病人的住所採集水及環境樣本，相關化驗工作仍在進行。

綜合病人的留醫時間、發病日期及初步化驗結果，中心現階段不排除該個案屬院內感染的可能性。

病人沒有家居接觸者。中心已對自十一月中起入住同一樓層的28名病人進行醫學監察，目前未有發現退伍軍人病個案，他們全部均已出院。

聖保祿醫院已關閉和停用涉事樓層的病房，並會按中心指示徹底消毒該樓層的供水系統。調查仍在進行中。中心已向醫院提供健康及醫學監察建議，並會繼續密切監察措施執行情況及進行流行病學調查。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池、加濕器和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

Local pig samples test positive for African Swine Fever virus,2025-12-17 20:51,2025-12-17 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700670.htm,"  The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) today (December 17) announced that samples taken from a licensed pig farm in Yuen Long had tested positive for the African Swine Fever (ASF) virus.

An AFCD spokesman said, ""Four pig samples were taken from a licensed pig farm in Lau Fau Shan, Yuen Long, yesterday (December 16). Upon testing by AFCD staff, all the samples were found positive for the ASF virus. The AFCD has immediately suspended transportation of any pigs from the farm concerned until further notice according to the contingency plan on ASF. The AFCD is arranging culling of pigs, for the sake of prudence.""

He further said, ""Positive cases should be seriously and promptly handled as the effect of ASF is very lethal to pigs. If the spread is not contained, a large number of pigs will die, hence seriously impacting pig farmers and the pig rearing industry. AFCD staff immediately notified all local pig farmers of this incident and reminded them to alert the AFCD immediately if abnormal health conditions are observed in pigs. In addition, the AFCD is arranging staff to inspect the one operating pig farm within 3 kilometres of the index farm and collect pig samples for ASF testing. For the sake of prudence, the AFCD has suspended movements of pigs on this pig farm until further notice. No reports of abnormalities from pig farms outside the 3km zone have been received so far. AFCD staff are continuing close surveillance to detect pigs with abnormalities and if a farm is infected as early as possible. Surveillance of the activities of nearby wild pigs of the index farm will also be stepped up. Moreover, the AFCD is maintaining close contact with pig farmers via text message groups, keeping them informed of the latest situation of ASF and ways to prevent the infection of pigs.""

The spokesman stressed that ASF is not a zoonotic disease and will not infect humans; hence, it does not cause any human health and food safety risks. Regardless of whether the pigs are infected with ASF, pork cooked thoroughly is safe for consumption. Members of the public do not need to be concerned. The AFCD held a seminar for pig farmers on specific preventive measures and biosecurity advice against ASF last month, with a view to enhancing vigilance of the industry in prevention of ASF. Meanwhile, in order to strengthen the knowledge of local pig farmers of the clinical signs of ASF for early detection and reporting of abnormalities of pigs, the AFCD has launched the Guidelines for Reporting Cases of African Swine Fever to assist pig farmers in identifying suspected cases for early reporting and appropriate follow-up.

The present case does not affect the operation of local slaughterhouses nor the overall supply of live pigs. Since June 2019, a daily clearance arrangement whereby live pigs will be slaughtered within 24 hours upon admittance has been imposed in Sheung Shui and Tsuen Wan slaughterhouses. Under the arrangement, lairages in different areas of the slaughterhouses will be cleared out and undergo thorough cleaning and disinfection every day to further enhance biosecurity and minimise the risk of infection among pigs in the slaughterhouses.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the AFCD will continue to stringently conduct cleaning and disinfection of Mainland live pig transportation vehicles and their counterparts for local pigs at slaughterhouses to minimise the risk of cross-infection of ASF. Mainland live pig vehicles and local ones should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected every time they leave the Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse (SSSH), and the respective designated positions for their cleaning and disinfection are separated. Manpower and equipment of the SSSH have been strengthened immediately for cleaning and disinfection of the vehicles. In light of these stepped-up measures, the slaughterhouses need not be closed and other pigs need not be culled.

As culling operation takes time, the AFCD will release updated operation information every day later on the departmental webpage,www.afcd.gov.hk, for the public."
本地豬隻樣本對非洲豬瘟病毒呈陽性反應,2025-12-17 20:50,2025-12-17 21:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700669.htm,"漁農自然護理署（漁護署）今日（十二月十七日）公布，在元朗一持牌豬場的豬隻樣本中檢測出非洲豬瘟病毒。

漁護署發言人說：「昨日（十二月十六日）從元朗流浮山一持牌豬場所抽取的四個豬隻樣本，經漁護署人員檢驗後發現全部樣本對非洲豬瘟病毒呈陽性反應。漁護署根據非洲豬瘟應變方案，已即時禁止有關豬場運出任何豬隻，直至另行通知。為謹慎起見，本署正安排銷毀場內豬隻。」

他續說：「由於豬隻感染非洲豬瘟後的死亡率極高，如不能遏止其傳播，豬隻將大量死亡，嚴重打擊豬農和養豬業，因此陽性個案必須認真和快速處理。漁護署已即時就相關個案通知所有本地豬農，並提醒他們如發現豬隻健康有異，應即時通知本署。漁護署正安排人員巡查有關豬場三公里內正在營運的一個豬場，並會為豬隻採樣作非洲豬瘟病毒檢測。為審慎起見，漁護署已暫時禁止該豬場運出豬隻直至另行通知。至於三公里以外的其他豬場，漁護署暫無收到豬隻有異常情況的報告。漁護署人員會繼續密切監察以及早發現豬隻異常情況和其他豬場是否受到感染，同時亦會加強監察涉事豬場附近區域的野豬活動情況。此外，漁護署亦正透過短訊群組和豬農保持密切聯繫，讓他們知悉非洲豬瘟的最新情況，以及如何防止豬隻受感染。」

發言人強調非洲豬瘟並非人畜共通傳染病，不會傳染給人類，因此不會構成人體健康和食物安全風險。無論豬隻是否受到非洲豬瘟病毒感染，豬肉煮熟後可放心食用，市民無須擔心。漁護署上月亦已舉辦座談會，向豬農提供針對性的非洲豬瘟防控措施及生物保安建議，以加強業界對非洲豬瘟的警覺，共同防範非洲豬瘟。同時，為加強豬農對非洲豬瘟病徵的認識以及早察覺並通報豬隻的異常狀況，漁護署已推出《非洲豬瘟個案呈報指引》，協助豬農偵察疑似個案，及早呈報並作出適當跟進。

個案不會影響本地屠房運作，亦不影響整體活豬供應。上水屠房及荃灣屠房自二○一九年六月起已實施「日日清」措施，即所有運到屠房的活豬會在24小時內屠宰，屠房內不同位置的豬欄每日均會清空，並進行徹底清潔消毒，進一步加強屠房生物保安及減少豬隻在屠房感染疾病的機會。

食物環境衞生署及漁護署亦會繼續嚴格執行內地活豬運輸車及本地活豬運輸車在屠房的清潔及消毒，減低非洲豬瘟交叉感染的風險。內地活豬運輸車及本地活豬運輸車每次離開上水屠房前須徹底清潔消毒，兩者的清潔消毒地點在分隔的專用位置。上水屠房亦已即時加強設備及人手以進行兩者的清潔消毒工作，因此屠房無須關閉或銷毁其他豬隻。

由於銷毀程序需時，漁護署網頁www.afcd.gov.hk稍後會每日更新有關行動的情況，方便公眾查閱。"

除夕跨年倒數安排

今年的除夕跨年倒數活動將會取消煙花匯演，以另一形式進行，與市民和旅客一起迎接新的一年。有關倒數活動的詳細安排，香港旅遊發展局（旅發局）會另行公布。

特別通關及相應公共交通服務安排

因應除夕跨年倒數活動的舉行，特區政府與深圳市政府已商討延長除夕的關口服務時間。內地口岸部門已經按程序要求上報國家口岸部門進行審批，詳情會盡快公布。而港珠澳大橋口岸及落馬洲／皇崗口岸在除夕夜會如常二十四小時通關。

口岸部門已減少前線人員休假，以便彈性調配人手，加開檢查櫃枱、臨時櫃枱及通道以疏導人流及車流。由香港警務處、入境事務處、香港海關及相關部門組成的跨部門聯合指揮中心，將於二○二五年十二月三十一日至二○二六年一月四日期間啓動，實時監察口岸現場情況，並與內地口岸部門透過已建立的口岸熱線及即時通報機制保持緊密聯繫，於有需要時迅速應變，靈活調配各管制站人員，以確保口岸運作暢順。

保安局亦會在二○二五年十二月三十一日至二○二六年一月四日啓動緊急事故監察及支援中心，密切監察和統籌各口岸的公眾秩序，並在有需要時協調跨部門的跟進行動，以迅速應對各種突發情況。

公共運輸安排方面，運輸署已主動聯繫各服務營辦商在假期期間加大運力，其中，香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵公司）會配合羅湖口岸的服務安排相應地延長東鐵線來往港鐵羅湖站的服務時間，而港鐵大部分鐵路線會於除夕夜通宵服務。另外，港鐵上水站及新田皇巴站之間會設有巴士路線，方便東鐵線旅客在前往羅湖的服務完結後，利用二十四小時通關的落馬洲／皇崗口岸過境。運輸署亦會配合口岸安排，加強連接各口岸的跨境交通服務，包括增加港珠澳大橋穿梭巴士（金巴）、落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）及跨境直通巴士的班次。在跨年倒數或其他大型公眾活動地點，運輸署在活動完結時會加強合適的本地公共運輸及跨境直通巴士服務，配合離場的本港市民和訪港旅客的不同出行需要，並制定預案，在有需要時於港珠澳大橋口岸、落馬洲／皇崗口岸及深圳灣口岸等地設立公共交通專用通道，確保公交服務暢順。各公共運輸營運商會預留足夠車輛和人手以滿足乘客的出行需求。

運輸署的緊急事故交通協調中心會二十四小時運作，密切監察全港各區、口岸和主要車站的交通情況和公共運輸服務，適時採取措施，應對服務需求，並透過各種渠道發放最新的交通消息。

人群管理和特別交通安排

警務處會安排足夠警力，按人流情況實施相應的人群管理措施和特別交通安排，確保活動安全有序地進行。各區民政事務處會密切留意區內的旅客人流情況，並按實際情況通報相關部門，以加強相關地點的管理安排。各個主要旅遊景點已制定特別方案，以應付預期增加的人流。

因應除夕及元旦假期期間到訪西貢萬宜水庫東壩的旅客數量或會明顯增加，警方已作出針對性的部署，包括調派軍裝人員於旅客抵達及離開之高峰時段在北潭涌、萬宜路及東壩的策略性位置進行交通管制及人流管理。為照顧往來西貢萬宜水庫東壩的乘客需求，運輸署已與專線小巴營辦商協調，因應乘客量增加第9A號線（北潭涌—萬宜水庫東壩）的小巴班次，配合警方實施的交通管制措施，靈活加密班次，以疏導候車乘客。

旅行團管理及保障旅客安排

就旅行團管理方面，旅遊業監管局（旅監局）已提醒負責接待內地入境旅行團的旅行代理商盡量分散入境時間，並與相關單位協調，在不同景點採取適當分流措施，做好人流和旅遊巴的管理工作，為旅客帶來良好旅遊體驗。旅監局亦會巡查入境旅行團註冊商店較多的地區，以及向旅客和導遊提供協助，以保障入境旅行團旅客的權益。此外，警方會繼續加強執法，打擊的士司機濫收車資、拒載等違法行為，海關亦會加強巡查接待旅客的店鋪，打擊不良營商手法。

天氣預報

CS chairs interdepartmental working group meeting on festival arrangements (with photos),2025-12-17 19:59,2025-12-17 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700719.htm,"The Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, today (December 17) chaired a meeting of the interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements to holistically co-ordinate and steer the preparatory work of various government departments for welcoming visitors to Hong Kong during the New Year's Eve and New Year holiday. The Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing; the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law; the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung; the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, and representatives from other relevant government departments also attended.

Mr Chan said, ""A series of events will be held in Hong Kong during the New Year's Eve and New Year holiday, and the New Year day also marks the start of a three-day long holiday on the Mainland. A notable increase in the number of visitors during the period is expected. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government will make good preparations for receiving visitors, including actively co-ordinating the ancillary arrangements of boundary control points (BCPs) and transportation, as well as maintaining close liaison with relevant organisations and the travel trade to ensure effective crowd management, information dissemination, and arrangements of public transportation and BCPs, with a view to ensuring the smooth operation of various aspects of receiving visitors and offering them a high-quality experience.""

New Year's Eve countdown arrangements

The New Year's Eve countdown event this year will forgo the fireworks display and take place in an alternative format to welcome the New Year together with the public and visitors. The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) will separately announce the detailed arrangements for the countdown event.

Special boundary-crossing and corresponding public transport service arrangements

In view of a series of New Year's Eve countdown events, the HKSAR Government has discussed with the Shenzhen Municipal Government to extend the service hours of BCPs on New Year's Eve. The Mainland port authorities have duly reported to the national port authorities for approval according to the required procedures. Further details will be announced as soon as possible. The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge BCP and the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang BCP will maintain 24-hour operation as usual on New Year's Eve.

Relevant departments have minimised leave for frontline officers to enable flexible deployment of manpower and operation of additional counters, temporary counters and channels, with a view to diverting passenger and vehicular flow. The Inter-departmental Joint Command Centre set up by the Hong Kong Police Force, the Immigration Department, the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED), and other relevant departments will be activated from December 31, 2025 to January 4, 2026, to monitor the real-time situation at various control points. The Joint Command Centre will maintain close liaison with the Mainland port authorities through the established port hotlines and real-time notification mechanism, and take timely contingency actions as necessary to flexibly deploy manpower at the BCPs to ensure smooth operation of the land control points.

The Security Bureau will also activate the Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre from December 31, 2025 to January 4, 2026 to closely monitor and co-ordinate public order at various BCPs and facilitate inter-departmental follow-up actions where necessary to respond promptly to various kinds of emergencies.

For public transport arrangements, the Transport Department (TD) has proactively approached various public transport operators to enhance their capacity during the holiday. The MTR Corporation Limited will cater for the arrangements of the Lo Wu BCP to extend services of the East Rail Line to and from MTR Lo Wu Station correspondingly, and the majority of MTR railway lines will operate overnight on New Year's Eve. Furthermore, bus routes will be arranged between MTR Sheung Shui Station and San Tin Yellow Bus Station to facilitate passengers using the East Rail Line in crossing the boundary via the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang BCP, which operates round-the-clock, after the end of services to Lo Wu. The TD will also cater for the arrangements of BCPs to enhance cross-boundary transportation services connecting various BCPs, including increasing the frequency of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) shuttle bus (Gold Bus), the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) and cross-boundary coach. Local public transport and cross-boundary coach services at countdown or other large-scale events will be strengthened upon event conclusion to accommodate the travel needs of departing residents and visitors, and the TD will formulate a contingency plan by establishing a dedicated passage at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge BCP, the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang BCP, and the Shenzhen Bay BCP etc. when necessary, to ensure the smooth operation of public transport services. Various public transport operators will reserve sufficient vehicles and manpower to meet the travel needs of visitors.

The Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre (ETCC) of the TD will operate 24 hours a day, closely monitor the traffic conditions and public transport services in all districts, BCPs, and major stations across Hong Kong, take prompt measures to address service demands, and disseminate the latest traffic updates through various channels.

Crowd management and special traffic arrangements

The Police will arrange sufficient manpower to implement corresponding crowd management measures and special traffic arrangements as necessary to ensure that all events will be conducted in a safe and orderly manner. Various district offices will closely monitor the flow of visitors in their respective areas, and report to relevant departments having regard to the actual circumstances to strengthen management arrangements of the relevant spots. Major tourist attractions have formulated special arrangements to handle the estimated increase of people flows.

In view of the potential notable increase in the number of tourists visiting Sai Kung High Island Reservoir East Dam during the New Year's Eve and New Year holiday, the Police have taken targeted measures, including deploying uniformed officers at strategic locations at Pak Tam Chung, Man Yee Road and East Dam, for traffic and crowd management during peak tourist arrival and departure periods. To cater for the needs of passengers travelling to Sai Kung High Island Reservoir East Dam, the TD has co-ordinated with the operator to enhance the service of GMB Route No. 9A (Pak Tam Chung - the East Dam) subject to passenger demand. Service frequencies will be flexibly strengthened in co-ordination with the traffic control measures implemented by the Police to ease passenger waiting times.

Management of tour groups and protection of visitors

  For management of tour groups, the Travel Industry Authority (TIA) has reminded travel agents receiving Mainland inbound tour groups to stagger arrival times as far as possible, and will co-ordinate with various parties to adopt appropriate diversion measures in tourist attractions to enable proper management of visitor flows and tour buses, with a view to offering a pleasant travel experience to visitors. The TIA will also conduct inspections in districts where relatively more registered shops for inbound tour groups are located, and offer assistance to visitors and tourist guides to protect inbound tour group visitors' rights. Additionally, the Police will continue to step up enforcement actions against the illegal acts of taxi drivers, including overcharging and refusing hire. The C&ED will also step up the inspection of shops serving visitors to combat unfair trade practices.

Weather forecast

As winter sets in, Hong Kong occasionally experiences temperature drops due to the influence of winter monsoons, but the chances of being affected by severe weather such as heavy rain or tropical cyclones are relatively low. The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) will release relevant weather information as early as possible. Travellers are advised to check the HKO's nine-day weather forecast and the latest weather warnings before travelling.

Information dissemination

  To assist visitors in planning their itineraries, the interdepartmental working group will strengthen information dissemination, including the latest inbound visitor arrivals, the situation at various BCPs, information on events, transport arrangements, and the latest weather forecast, to enable residents and visitors to plan their itineraries according to the latest situation.

The HKTB has listed festive event arrangements for the Christmas and New Year holiday on its dedicated webpage. Before the New Year holiday, the HKTB will provide the waiting time at major attractions in Hong Kong, including Hong Kong Disneyland, Ocean Park Hong Kong, the Peak Tram, Ngong Ping 360, and Hong Kong Observation Wheel, as well as the Star Ferry, a popular choice for many visitors, on their webpage to help the local public and visitors plan their itineraries.

Residents and visitors may also visit ""Easy Boundary"" (www.sb.gov.hk/eng/bwt/status.html?type=outbound), a one-stop information platform on immigration clearance launched by the Security Bureau, to obtain useful information in one go, including the respective average waiting time for passengers and private cars at land BCPs, as well as for the Gold Bus and Yellow Bus to plan their trips and save waiting time."

勞工及福利局局長為「廣東院舍照顧服務計劃--醫療補貼試行安排」啟動儀式主禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-12-17 18:45,2025-12-17 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700655.htm,"​以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十二月十七日）下午為「廣東院舍照顧服務計劃—醫療補貼試行安排」啟動儀式主禮的致辭全文：

李可東總經理（中國太平保險集團總經理）、呂峰副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室經濟部副部長）、張雲正行政總監（保險業監管局行政總監）、于曉副會長兼總裁（香港中國企業協會副會長兼總裁）、陳沛良議員（立法會議員、中國太平保險（香港）有限公司總經理）、劉鈞執行董事兼行政總裁（招商永隆銀行執行董事兼行政總裁）：

很高興今日能再次來到中國太平的總部，參與這具有里程碑意義的發布會，為何我會這樣說？剛才播放的影片，大家看到過去十年多廣東院舍照顧服務計劃由一個概念，到一個只是少量人士參與的計劃，再到過去兩年我們取得非常令人鼓舞的成績。

過去兩年我們第一步的戰略是令參加的院舍數目大幅增長，若大家有參與其中，會知道過往頗長時間只有兩間院舍，一間在深圳，一間在肇慶。經過同事、業界和廣東省的大力幫忙，在短短約兩年時間，擴展到24間，內地灣區九市中八個城市已設點，對於有意到灣區養老的香港「老友記」來說選擇多了很多。但無論是我們跟老人家溝通或業界所進行的調研，均明顯指出一個很大的痛點：即使他們在灣區養老其實不用付費，香港符合資格長者在香港住資助院舍，其實每個月要付二千多元，而他們到灣區養老參加廣東院舍照顧服務計劃，這二千多元是不用付的；同樣地香港只有一張床，到灣區就是一間房，怎麼這麼大的分別、有這麼好的服務，為何參與人數增加的速度仍未如所想？

我們跟老友記溝通，他們擔心的不外乎幾樣：一是擔心搬遠了，子女會否來探望，我認為現時這並非大問題，大家都習慣了北上消費；另一個擔憂是如何面對醫療需要，但隨着內地醫療的水平質素飛快發展，很多港人對內地醫療的質素很有信心。剩餘的就是「荷包」問題，也就是要付多少錢的問題。其實國家對我們香港老人家很好，香港老人家到內地居住，拿到內地居住的身分，已經無需年輕時有供款都可以買「城鄉保」和「惠民保」，這是國家對我們非常大的鼓勵和支持，支持我們老人家到內地養老。但是大家都明白內地的醫保跟香港不同，當中設有共付額，我們跟長者和專家溝通時發現，如果連共付這部分也可讓老人家安心的話，相信有更多人願意透過我們的廣東院舍照顧服務計劃去養老。

要打破、要走出這一步看似容易，實際上我們的同事，以及中國太平保險集團做了大量工作。因為當中牽涉大量調研工作，然後再構想如何落實。事實上，我們的團隊於兩年前已提出了這個想法，由構想變成一個可以操作的模式經歷了一年時間。在過程中得到很多人的幫助，同事也多次到廣東實地調研。我們要了解內地的醫保制度如何運作，以至具體落實。我們要如何做好醫保試行計劃，就需要最後一塊拼圖——即誰去做實質操作的機構，這個機構是十分重要的。無論概念有多好，如果實質操作的機構不熟悉我們的情況、不熟悉香港，兩者之間沒辦法建立工作互信的話，就不能成事。所以我本人，以及團隊衷心感謝，亦十分慶幸得到中國太平保險集團的參與，有了它們的參與，最後這塊拼圖就得以完成，令整個計劃由構想到落實得以成真。這不單是關乎香港長者的福祉，其實也是一個很實實在在的舉措，彰顯香港如何主動融入國家發展大局。其實就是一個十分實在的事情，既惠及長者，也可以令香港融入國家發展，所以今日我覺得是一個很重要的里程碑。

當醫保試行計劃推出後，我期待參與廣東院舍照顧服務計劃的長者人數會有另一番增長。其實現在參與人數已十分理想，截至今日為止，已經有超過800位長者入住，兩年前只有約100人，用了兩年時間就上升了七倍。這只是起步而已，我相信隨着醫保的試行安排推行後，會令到很多長者免卻對於醫療的擔憂，讓他們更加放心，不要只在香港睡一張床，不如到內地灣區城市裏一些優質的養老機構，以我理解最基本都是雙人房，而且活動空間非常大。對香港長者來說可以享受一個廣闊的生活空間，亦可以享有更優質的退休生活。對香港政府來說亦沒有額外財政負擔，我們計算過長者於內地養老或在香港養老，香港政府所付出的費用是一樣的，我們利用兩地之間的成本差異、用了兩地之間的各自優勢就能發展這個計劃。

我很開心今日能完成最後一塊拼圖，透過中國太平保險集團的協作，令我們可以走出去。我期待一年後再作回顧時，大家就能看見這次醫保試行計劃帶來的效益。在這裏要再次感謝中國太平保險集團的全力協作，亦期待有更多的香港長者可以享受到這個新計劃的安排，令到他們既住得好，亦住得穩，知道自己醫療的需要並得到妥當照護。多謝大家。"

Hong Kong-Guangdong Joint Working Group on Environmental Protection and Combating Climate Change meeting held via video conferencing (with photos),2025-12-17 17:52,2025-12-17 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700340.htm,"The Secretary for Environment and Ecology of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Mr Tse Chin-wan, and the Director-General of the Department of Ecology and Environment of Guangdong Province (GDDEE), Ms Xu Xiaoxia, today (December 17) co-chaired the seventh meeting of the Hong Kong-Guangdong Joint Working Group on Environmental Protection and Combating Climate Change via video conferencing. The meeting reviewed their work progress in 2025 and agreed on the collaboration work plan for 2026.

Governments of both Hong Kong and Guangdong agreed that the two places have continued to maintain close co-operation on various fronts in the past year, including improvement of air quality in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, protection of the water environment, strengthening forestry and marine resources conservation, and combating climate change, as well as the development of a ""Zero Waste Bay Area"". The two sides will continue to promote and deepen exchanges, co-operation and scientific research relating to climate change mitigation, adaptation and resilience.

On improving air quality, Hong Kong and Guangdong implemented the PRD Regional Air Quality Management Plan and monitored the progress and effectiveness of various improvement measures. The annual average concentrations of various air pollutants in 2024 have declined between 18 per cent and 86 per cent from their peak levels. Representatives of the Hong Kong side highlighted that promoting green transportation helps improve air quality. The number of electric private cars in Hong Kong has been growing rapidly. Currently, more than seven out of every 10 newly registered private cars are electric, with a growth rate among the top globally. The HKSAR Government will continue to actively promote the use of electric vehicles and expand the charging network in the future. In the coming years, Hong Kong and Guangdong will continue to work together on the demonstration projects of cross-boundary goods vehicles transitioning into new energy vehicles and the construction of the Greater Bay Area Air Quality Health Index.

On marine environment management, Governments of both Hong Kong and Guangdong agreed that the Notification and Alert System on Marine Refuse has been functioning well since its commencement in 2017. To further enhance the effectiveness of the system, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has used the latest wind forecast and relevant data, together with a new generation of regional hydrodynamic model, to more accurately predict areas that may potentially be affected by marine refuse. As of mid-November this year, the system has issued 65 notifications in response to heavy rainfall or major marine environmental incidents, which effectively enabled relevant government departments to take timely clean-up actions. Both sides will continue to explore technologies and measures to monitor marine refuse and tackle marine environmental incidents, as well as further extending co-operation in the management of the marine environment with cities in the region.

As regards ecological conservation, Hong Kong and Guangdong will continue to foster in-depth exchanges and enhance collaboration on the establishment, management, conservation, staff training, publicity and education, etc, in relation to forestry, ecological corridors across the boundary and wetland reserve projects, as well as to take forward the sustainable development of marine resources and the conservation of marine environment, including projects for the conservation of rare marine animals, ecological and environmental monitoring, restoration and enhancement of fisheries resources, sustainable development of mariculture, and joint enforcement operations between Hong Kong and Guangdong.

Hong Kong and Guangdong will also take forward the development of a ""Zero Waste Bay Area"", jointly promoting regional resources circulation in both places, exploring the feasibility of cross-regional co-operation in handling recyclable materials and co-ordinating collaborative initiatives of the two places.

Representatives of the Hong Kong side attended the meeting today were from the Environment and Ecology Bureau, the Development Bureau, the Buildings Department, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, the Civil Engineering and Development Department, the Drainage Services Department, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, the Department of Health, the EPD, the Hong Kong Observatory, and the Water Supplies Department. Representatives of the Guangdong side were from the GDDEE, the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Guangdong Province, the Forestry Administration of Guangdong Province, the Guangdong Provincial Development and Reform Commission, the Guangdong Meteorological Service, the Department of Industry and Information Technology of Guangdong Province, and the Shenzhen Municipal Ecological Environment Bureau."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-17 17:50,2025-12-17 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700571.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 17), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.    
  
Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. As the CHP and the relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails recently, the CHP continues to appeal to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

  The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm. All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

  Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
鄉郊保育辦公室公布鄉郊地區賓館／食物業牌照申請指引,2025-12-17 17:20,2025-12-17 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700502.htm,"環境及生態局鄉郊保育辦公室（鄉郊辦）今日（十二月十七日）公布鄉郊地區賓館／食物業牌照申請指引，為有意在鄉郊地區經營賓館或食肆的人士，提供申請相關牌照的指引。

鄉郊辦發言人說：「新界許多鄉郊村落既有自然風光，亦有豐富的人文歷史元素，不少市民會在周末和假日到訪。由於往往涉及土地及規劃等不同範疇的事宜，申請牌照並不容易，現時在鄉郊地區的賓館和食肆數目不多。為了協助有意在鄉郊地區經營賓館或食肆的人士，政府成立了跨部門的鄉郊地區賓館及食物業牌照工作小組，因應鄉郊環境的獨特性，優化和理順相關程序的執行細節和步驟，並制訂一系列涉及規劃、土地和牌照事項的便利措施。鄉郊辦將這些措施匯編成《申請指引》，並列舉申請牌照時需要注意的事項及提供相關部門的聯絡方法。」

政府推行的便利措施包括：


根據相關法定分區計劃大綱圖的規定，在劃為「鄉村式發展」地帶內按《建築物條例（新界適用）條例》的規定所建成的新界豁免管制屋宇，包括於一九六一年後建成的新界豁免管制屋宇，在其地面一層經營食肆屬經常准許用途，無需申請規劃許可，村民在獲得有效牌照後便可營業；




就合資格申請賓館／食物業牌照的現有村屋，因佔用政府土地或違反土地契約所產生的短期租約租金和短期豁免書費用，會由獲發經營牌照日起開始計算，以及豁免繳交申請短期租約及短期豁免書的一次性行政費；




擬備一系列處理城市規劃、土地事宜的範本和清單，讓村民或營運者更易理解牌照申請的要求及程序，節省其成本和時間；




擬備「第三方認證」的範本和指定表格，核證現有村屋的結構穩定性；及




訂立新的機制，以「第三方認證」方式對相關處所現有的化糞池進行評估，省卻興建新化糞池的需要。


自制訂上述便利措施後，已有分別位於荔枝窩、鹽田梓和谷埔的賓館、外賣店和餐廳獲批營業牌照。政府會繼續為業界拆牆鬆綁，落實《行政長官2025年施政報告》提出的措施，進一步簡化食肆發牌制度和加快審批食肆露天座位的申請。

Countryside Conservation Office publishes guides to guesthouse and food business licence applications in countryside areas,2025-12-17 17:20,2025-12-17 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700504.htm,"The Countryside Conservation Office (CCO) of the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) today (December 17) announced the publication of guides to guesthouse and food business licence applications in countryside areas, which provides guidance for individuals interested in operating guesthouses or food business premises in countryside areas to apply for relevant licences.

A spokesperson for the CCO said, ""Many countryside villages in the New Territories offer both natural scenery and rich cultural heritage, and many members of the public pay visits to these areas during weekends and holidays. However, the number of guesthouses and food business premises currently operating in countryside areas is limited, as the process of licence applications can be challenging, given matters such as land and planning are involved. To assist individuals who are interested in operating guesthouses or food business premises in the countryside areas, the Government has set up an interdepartmental Task Force on Guesthouse and Food Business Licences in Countryside Areas. The Task Force has enhanced and rationalised the implementation details and steps of the relevant processes and formulated a series of streamlined measures covering planning, land, and licensing matters, taking into account the uniqueness of the rural settings. The CCO has compiled these measures into the guides, listing out key points-to-note in the process of licence applications, and providing contact information of the relevant departments.""
â
The streamlined measures put forward by the Government include:


Based on the requirements of the relevant statutory Outline Zoning Plans (OZPs), for New Territories Exempted Houses (NTEHs) constructed by virtue of the Buildings Ordinance (Application to the New Territories) Ordinance within the land use zone of ""Village Type Development"", including those NTEHs built after 1961, operating a food business on their ground floor is always permitted, without the need to apply for planning permission. Villagers may commence business upon obtaining a valid licence;




For existing Old Village Houses (OVHs) eligible for guesthouse/food business licence applications, Short Term Tenancy (STT) rental and Short Term Waiver (STW) fees arising from encroachment on government land or breach of lease conditions will only begin to accrue from the date when the business licence is issued, and the payment of a one-off administrative fee for applying STT and STW is waived;




A series of templates and checklists for tackling town planning and land matters have been prepared to help villagers and operators better understand the licensing requirements and procedures, thereby saving costs and time;




A ""Third party certification"" template and prescribed form for certifying OVHs' structural stability have been prepared; and




A new mechanism has been established to assess existing septic tanks systems of relevant premises through ""third party certification"", obviating the need to construct new ones.


Since the formulation of the above streamlined measures, there have been guesthouses, a takeaway shop and a restaurant located in Lai Chi Wo, Yim Tin Tsai and Kuk Po respectively, having been granted relevant business licences. The Government will continue to facilitate the trade by further simplifying the food business licensing regime and expediting the approval process for applications for outdoor seating areas of restaurants, with a view to implementing the measures stipulated in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address.

The guides have been uploaded to the CCO website (cco.gov.hk/en/licensing).

The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, attended the launching ceremony of the Pilot Medical Subsidy Arrangement. He said that the HKSAR Government introduces the medical subsidy through policy innovation, providing additional healthcare support for the elderly participants of the Scheme. He was delighted that Taiping Life (Hong Kong) had been selected as the service provider through an open bidding process, and said he looked forward to Taiping Life (Hong Kong)'s promotion of cross-boundary elderly care through professional services.

Under the Pilot Medical Subsidy Arrangement, Taiping Life (Hong Kong) will assist the HKSAR Government in processing applications for reimbursement of medical expenses by elderly persons, including vetting and settling claims of relevant medical expenses and conducting investigation of medical services, etc.

In recent years, the HKSAR Government has been proactively expanding and enhancing the Scheme. To date, 24 residential care homes for the elderly have joined the Scheme, covering eight GBA Mainland cities with over 800 Hong Kong elderly residents.

DH to expand scope of services and list of beneficiaries under Community Dental Support Programme next month and cover homeless individuals,2025-12-17 16:10,2025-12-17 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700308.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) today (December 17) reminded the public that, as announced on August 15, the Community Dental Support Programme (CDSP) will expand its scope of services starting from January 1 next year, adding new services, namely dental scaling, root canal treatment, removal of bridges and crowns, and fitting of removable dentures. The CDSP will also extend coverage to homeless individuals, further focusing on providing more subsidised preventive and curative dental services to the underprivileged in need.At the same time, the CDSP will also supplant the Community Care Fund Elderly Dental Assistance Programme (EDAP) that will cease to accept applications from January 1 next year.

With the expansion of the beneficiaries list of the CDSP to cover the homeless, social workers, through the service networks of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), will identify and assist eligible homeless individuals with the application documents and co-ordinate appointments with dental clinics. Eligible homeless individuals must be a holder of a Hong Kong identity card, be enrolled in the Electronic Health System (eHealth), and be a service user of any of the following services provided by the Social Welfare Department to street sleepers:


Temporary Shelters;
Urban Hostels for Single Persons;
Integrated Services Teams for Street Sleepers; or
Care and Support Networking Team (street sleepers only).


Additionally, each eligible service user may apply for subsidised dental services once every 180 days currently, the scope of which includes preventive and curative oral health and dental care services. Subject to the assessment by the attending registered dentist, each participant will be provided with specified subsidised dental services, including oral health assessment, medication for dental pain relief (when necessary), X-ray examinations, dental fillings or extractions. With the expansion of the scope of services effective from January 1 next year, each participant can receive dental scaling services and root canal treatment for one tooth every 365 days, and removal of one bridge or two crownsevery 180 days. Regarding the fitting of removable dentures, each participant can receive the service up to two times, with an interval of at least five years in between. To ensure the proper use of limited resources to achieve greater cost-effectiveness and to allow the underprivileged to receive the most effective treatment services, removable dentures fitting service will only be available to eligible persons with fewer than 20 remaining teeth, who must first be assessed by a dentist as having difficulties in eating or chewing and whose eating ability could be effectively restored by the fitting of removable dentures.

The expanded CDSP will supplant the EDAP, which will cease to accept applications from January 1 next year. For details of the CDSP (including the administration fee and co-payment fee of services), please visit the designated website (www.communitydental.gov.hk).

In March 2025, the DH launched the Primary Dental Co-care Pilot Scheme for Adolescents (PDCC), which serves as an interface with the School Dental Care Service by providing partial subsidies for dental check-up services for adolescents aged 13 to 17. It helps adolescents foster a long-term partnership with registered dentists in the private sector and enables them to build a lifelong habit of regular dental check-ups. Eligible adolescents can receive subsidised services once every calendar year. Currently, 572 private dentists are participating in the PDCC, with over 960 service locations. With school holidays approaching, the DH encourages adolescents to take advantage of the long holidays to participate in the PDCC and welcome the new year with good health and confidence. Members of the public may visit the PDCC webpage (www.communitydental.gov.hk/en/pdcc/introduction_of_pdcc.html) for more information.

The Government's oral health policy aims to enable all Hong Kong citizens to enhance their oral hygiene and lifestyles. By adopting the strategies of developing community-wide preventive primary oral healthcare while providing essential dental care services targeting underprivileged groups in formulating the dental services, the Government aims to assist citizens in practicing prevention, early identification, and timely intervention for dental diseases.The CDSP and PDCC have collectively benefited over 10 000 eligible individuals."

Professor Chan (Choh-Ming Li Professor of Medicine and Therapeutics of thethe Faculty of Medicine of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Professor Francis Chan), Professor Ng (Associate Dean (Research) of the Faculty of Medicine of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Croucher Professor of Medical Sciences, Professor Siew Ng), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. I am pleased to join the Faculty of Medicine of CUHK (Chinese University of Hong Kong) at the launch of its groundbreaking innovation in early detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Congratulations to CUHK Faculty of Medicine and MicroSigX on your achievements, which once again exemplify the fruitful outcomes of our collaborative efforts in innovation and technology (I&T).

  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is firmly committed to developing Hong Kong into an international I&T centre. This vision builds on our flourishing life and health technology research, underpinned by the close collaboration among the Government, industry, academia, and research sectors. We have been channeling more funding support into our universities for commercialising their research and development (R&D) outcomes through various initiatives such as the Research, Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme launched in 2023. The Scheme has been well received by universities as well as the industry sector. Since its inception, a total of 49 projects were supported in the first two rounds, covering various technological fields including health and medical sciences, new materials and new energy, artificial intelligence and robotics, etc, with the total funding amounting to over $2 billion.

   Another major I&T initiative of the Government to develop Hong Kong into an international I&T centre is the InnoHK Research Clusters. InnoHK leverages Hong Kong's advantages as an international city to promote global I&T co-operation and bring together leading researchers from around the world to conduct R&D in collaboration with local universities. The Government has encouraged the research centres under InnoHK to further increase the adoption rate of R&D projects, promote recognition in the industry and accelerate technology transfer and commercialisation of R&D outcomes. It is worth noting that MicroSigX's technology is in part underpinned by the research conducted at Microbiota I-Center, a research centre established under InnoHK. We are happy to see that our research centres under InnoHK are turning upstream R&D into real application and products in the market.

  Today's pilot initiative not only marks a milestone in commercialisation of research and development outcomes, but also benefits the underprivileged local families by providing free tests to those in need with the assistance of non-governmental organisations. This is exactly our ultimate goal in promoting I&T: harnessing technological breakthroughs to benefit our society as a whole. We genuinely hope that advances in technology will bring meaningful benefits for society at large and improve people's quality of life.

The Government will continue to provide robust policy and support to enhance the overall I&T ecosystem in Hong Kong and develop Hong Kong into an international I&T centre. Let us work hand in hand to realise this vision. Thank you."

陳美寶在會上表示：「香港作為國際航空超級樞紐，有着國家的堅定支持，同時聯通世界。三跑道系統的啓用為香港帶來前所未有的增長，並有助我們建立新的全球夥伴關係。委員會的成立體現我們對擴展航空網絡、優化粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）內多式聯運連接及培育專業人才的承諾。我們會把握香港背靠祖國、聯通世界的優勢和機遇，主動與『十五五』規劃對接，並期望各委員一同出謀獻策，為鞏固香港作為領先航空超級樞紐地位並繼續蓬勃發展而努力。」

行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》表示，政府致力以多管齊下的策略強化香港國際航空樞紐地位，包括加速航空網絡擴展、優化大灣區的多式聯運連接、推進機場城市的發展，以及鞏固香港作為全球領先空貨運樞紐的地位。委員會一致支持政府的政策方向，並就如何充分發揮香港在「一國兩制」下的獨特優勢提出建議。

其中，有成員認為優化大灣區的多式聯運連接能促進香港國際機場可持續增長。就此，政府一直與航空業緊密合作，以加強香港國際機場的多式聯運網絡，並提升香港作為大灣區中轉樞紐的吸引力，包括自今年十月一日起擴大機場乘客離境稅的免徵範圍，為中轉乘客使用香港國際機場提供更大誘因。另外，他們亦備悉市場對香港機場管理局年初宣布的品牌SKYTOPIA反應熱烈，並就如何提高其社會經濟效益提供建議。

國際航空超級樞紐發展諮詢委員會旨在為政府規劃香港航空業發展的未來方向提供高層次建議，成員來自航空、商業與金融、創新科技、物流與運輸、學術界及旅遊等多個領域，亦包括相關政府部門代表。"
Advisory Committee on Development of International Aviation Superhub holds first meeting (with photos),2025-12-17 13:15,2025-12-17 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700324.htm,"  The Advisory Committee on Development of International Aviation Superhub (ACDIAS), chaired by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, convened its first meeting today (December 17), signifying a pivotal advancement in enhancing Hong Kong's position as an international aviation superhub.

  Ms Chan said at the meeting, ""With steadfast national support and strong global connectivity, Hong Kong stands as an international aviation superhub. The transition to a three-runway system enables us to achieve unprecedented growth and forge new global partnerships. The establishment of the ACDIAS demonstrates our commitment to enhancing our aviation network, improving intermodal connections within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and developing a skilled workforce. We will leverage Hong Kong's advantages and opportunities of enjoying strong support of the motherland while being closely connected to the world, proactively aligning with the national 15th Five-Year-Plan. I hope that with members' collective wisdom and insights, Hong Kong will continue to thrive as a leading aviation superhub.""

  As outlined in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, the Government is dedicated to bolstering Hong Kong's position as an international aviation hub through multipronged strategies, including accelerating the expansion of the aviation network, enhancing intermodal connectivity in the GBA, advancing the development of the Airport City, and reinforcing Hong Kong's status as the world's leading air cargo hub. The ACDIAS indicated support to the policy directions of the Government, offering suggestions on how the unique advantages of Hong Kong under the ""one country, two systems"" principle should be leveraged.

  Among others, members considered that intermodal connectivity in the GBA would be conducive to the sustainable growth of Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). To this end, the Government has been working closely with the aviation industry to strengthen the intermodal network of HKIA and the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a transfer hub in the GBA, such as providing more incentive for transfer passengers by expanding the scope of exemption from the airport passenger departure tax with effect from October 1 this year. Members also noted the positive feedback received from the market since the announcement of the Airport Authority Hong Kong's brand SKYTOPIA early this year, and advised on ways to maximise the associated socioeconomic benefits.

政府就檢討註冊外觀設計制度展開公眾諮詢,2025-12-17 12:35,2025-12-17 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700274.htm,"政府今日（十二月十七日）就檢討註冊外觀設計制度展開為期三個月的公眾諮詢。

工業品外觀設計是一種知識產權，泛指產品的裝飾性特徵，展現設計師在製作吸引消費者的產品時付出的智力和其敏銳觸覺。按《註冊外觀設計條例》（《條例》）（第522章），工業品外觀設計可在香港註冊成為「註冊外觀設計」，藉以獲得法律保護。

商務及經濟發展局（商經局）發言人表示：「《條例》自一九九七年制定以來，外觀設計的國際趨勢已顯著轉變，特別是隨着科技創新和進步，開拓了設計及製造產業發展的新可能性和機遇。隨着科技創新和產業融合，企業應用於產品的外觀設計成為其成功的關鍵。」

發言人強調：「在推動新型工業發展的過程中，香港必須持續為外觀設計提供有效保護，這不單對鼓勵可持續創新與創意至關重要，對推動本港先進製造業界和新興產業的外觀設計能力亦是不可或缺。事實上，各個司法管轄區過去多年亦對外觀設計法例的不同範疇進行了檢討和改革。」

發言人續說：「政府致力維護有效堅實的知識產權保護制度。為確保本港的註冊外觀設計制度與時並進，保持競爭力，並能回應本地產業不斷轉變的需要，政府認為現時是合適時候，需要對外觀設計制度進行全面檢討。就如二○二五年《施政報告》所公布，政府正進行下一步檢討工作，就檢討註冊外觀設計制度的相關議題展開諮詢。」

諮詢文件探討與本地註冊外觀設計制度相關的多項議題，涵蓋外觀設計的法律保護範圍及要求、外觀設計申請及註冊的程序，以至與國際做法與標準接軌的可行情況。有關文件已上載至商經局（www.cedb.gov.hk）和知識產權署（www.ipd.gov.hk）網頁。公眾人士可於二○二六年三月十六日或之前透過電郵（design_consultation@cedb.gov.hk）、傳真（2147 3065）或郵寄（香港添馬添美道二號政府總部西翼二十三樓商務及經濟發展局第三部）提交意見及相關資料。

​政府亦會舉辦兩場簡介會，收集對是次諮詢的意見。詳情容後在商經局及知識產權署的網頁上公布。"
Government launches public consultation on review of registered designs regime,2025-12-17 12:35,2025-12-17 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700273.htm," The Government today (December 17) launched a three-month public consultation on the review of the registered designs regime of Hong Kong.

 Industrial design as a type of intellectual property broadly refers to the ornamental aspect of a product. It embodies a designer's intellectual efforts and acumen for making a product appealing to customers. Legal protection of an industrial design can be obtained in Hong Kong by way of registration under the Registered Designs Ordinance (Cap. 522) (the Ordinance).

 A spokesman for the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB) said, ""Since the enactment of the Ordinance in 1997, design trends around the world have significantly evolved with technological innovation and advancement, opening up new possibilities and opportunities for growth of the creative and manufacturing industries. With technological innovation and integration of industries, designs that a business applies to products have become instrumental to the degree of its success.""

The spokesman stressed, ""In driving towards new industrialisation, Hong Kong must continue to afford effective protection for designs which is crucial to not only incentivising sustainable innovation and creativity, but also enhancing the design capability of our advanced manufacturing sectors and emerging industries. As a matter of fact, there have been a number of reviews and reforms in different areas of designs laws in various jurisdictions over the years.""

 The spokesman added, ""The Government is fully committed to upholding an effective and robust intellectual property protection regime. To ensure that our registered designs regime is up to date and remains competitive for meeting the changing needs of our industries, the Government considers it timely and necessary to conduct a comprehensive review of the regime. As announced in the 2025 Policy Address, the Government is now embarking on the next step of the review by launching a consultation on various issues pertinent to updating the regime.""

 The consultation document looks into a wide range of issues pertaining to the local registered designs regime, from the scope of and requirements for legal protection of designs, the procedures for design applications and registrations, to the possible alignment with international practices and standards. It has been uploaded onto the websites of the CEDB (www.cedb.gov.hk) and the Intellectual Property Department (IPD) (www.ipd.gov.hk). Members of the public may submit their views and relevant information by email (design_consultation@cedb.gov.hk), fax (2147 3065) or post (Division 3, Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, 23/F, West Wing, Central Government Offices, 2 Tim Mei Avenue, Tamar, Hong Kong) on or before March 16, 2026.

 The Government will also organise engagement sessions to collect views on the consultation. Details will be announced on the websites of the CEDB and IPD in due course."

一氧化碳是一種無色、無味、無嗅且極具毒性的氣體。一般而言，在通風不足的工作場所使用以燃油（例如柴油、汽油、煤氣等）驅動的設備、引擎或供暖系統，均有機會令工人出現一氧化碳中毒。

為加強持責者對預防一氧化碳中毒的意識，勞工處分析近年在不同工作場所發生的一氧化碳中毒個案，整合常見的意外成因和應採取的預防措施，編製《預防工作場所一氧化碳中毒指引》。指引內容全面，涵蓋在工作場所一氧化碳的來源及危害、預防措施，以及安全工作系統包括風險評估、一氧化碳的監測與測量、緊急處理程序及培訓等。

勞工處將聯同職業安全健康局於二○二六年一月舉辦網上講座，向建造、飲食、物業管理、物流貨運、潔淨及環境衞生等相關行業的持份者介紹該指引，提高業界對預防一氧化碳中毒的意識，藉以保障僱員的職業安全與健康。

  CO is a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas that is highly poisonous. In general, the use of fuel-powered (such as diesel, petrol and town gas) equipment, engines or heating systems in poorly ventilated workplaces may lead to CO poisoning of workers.
â
  To enhance duty holders' awareness of CO poisoning prevention, the LD has analysed CO poisoning cases in various workplaces in recent years and collated common causes of the accidents and preventive measures for formulating the Guidance Notes on Prevention of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning in Workplaces. The guidance notes are comprehensive, covering the sources and hazards of CO at work, preventive measures, as well as safe systems of work including risk assessment, CO monitoring and measurement, emergency procedures, training and more.

  The LD, together with the Occupational Safety and Health Council, will hold an online seminar in January 2026 to introduce the guidance notes to stakeholders in related industries such as construction, catering, property management, logistics and freight transport, and cleaning and environmental hygiene to enhance their awareness of CO poisoning prevention and safeguard the occupational safety and health of employees.

  The Guidance Notes on Prevention of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning in Workplaces can be downloaded at the LD's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/common/public/oh/CarbonMonoxide_GN_en.pdf) or by scanning the QR code (see Annex). For enquiries, please call the LD's hotline at 2852 4041 or 2542 2172."

UNIDROIT's Asia-Pacific Liaison Office to be established at Hong Kong Legal Hub,2025-12-17 11:00,2025-12-17 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700254.htm,"âThe General Assembly of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT), at its 85th session, decided on the establishment of the UNIDROIT Asia-Pacific Liaison Office in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China. The Office is expected to open at the Hong Kong Legal Hub in the second half of 2026, as part of UNIDROIT's centenary celebration next year.

The proposal for the establishment of the Office was submitted by the Department of Justice (DoJ) of the HKSAR Government to the secretariat of UNIDROIT, with the staunch and unwavering support of the Central People's Government. In May this year, the UNIDROIT Governing Council expressed support for the proposal and recommended it to the General Assembly for decision at its 85th session held on December 11. The decision by the General Assembly in accepting the recommendation has marked the first regional presence of UNIDROIT outside its seat in Rome in its 100 years of history.

China has been a member of UNIDROIT since 1986. The HKSAR has participated in the work of UNIDROIT as part of the Chinese delegation. In recent years, the DoJ has been collaborating closely with UNIDROIT, including co-organising biennial Asia-Pacific International Private Law Summits in the HKSAR since 2022 and joint seminars in Rome in 2023 and 2025, as well as seconding legal professionals from both the private and public sectors in the HKSAR to the secretariat of UNIDROIT annually, pursuant to the Memoranda of Understanding signed between the DoJ and UNIDROIT in 2021 and 2022.It is anticipated that the establishment of the Office in 2026 will further strengthen the existing collaborative relationship between the DoJ and UNIDROIT in the years to come.

Hosting UNIDROIT's first overseas office in the HKSAR is a significant milestone for the city's development as a legal hub, as it reflects the international community's continued confidence in the HKSAR's legal system and reinforces its position as a leading international legal hub.The Office will establish a stable physical presence of UNIDROIT in the Asia-Pacific region to more efficiently and effectively support its work in the region.It could also contribute to facilitating co-ordination and creating synergies among the ""three sisters of private international law"", namely UNIDROIT, the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH), and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), at the Hong Kong Legal Hub, which has already housed the HCCH Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific and the DoJ Project Office for Collaboration with UNCITRAL.

UNIDROIT is an independent intergovernmental organisation with its seat in Rome.Currently, UNIDROIT has 65 member states from five continents. The purpose of UNIDROIT is to study the needs and methods for modernising, harmonising and co-ordinating private and, in particular, commercial law among states and groups of states and to formulate uniform law instruments, principles and rules to achieve those objectives."

國際統一私法協會亞太地區聯絡辦公室落戶香港法律樞紐,2025-12-17 11:00,2025-12-17 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/17/P2025121700249.htm,"​國際統一私法協會在第八十五屆大會上，決議於中華人民共和國香港特別行政區（香港特區）設立亞太地區聯絡辦公室。該辦公室預計將於明年下半年進駐香港法律樞紐，作為國際統一私法協會百年慶典活動之一。

在中央人民政府堅定不移的支持下，香港特區政府律政司向國際統一私法協會秘書處提交設立辦公室的建議。今年五月，國際統一私法協會理事會表示支持，並建議提交予十二月十一日舉行的第八十五屆大會作出決定。國際統一私法協會大會接納此項建議的決定，標誌着協會成立百年以來，首次在羅馬總部以外設立區域辦公室。

中國自一九八六年起即為國際統一私法協會成員國。香港特區作為中國代表團成員，一直參與國際統一私法協會的工作。近年來，律政司與國際統一私法協會保持緊密合作，包括根據律政司與協會於二○二一年及二○二二年簽署的諒解備忘錄，自二○二二年起於香港特區共同舉辦兩年一度的亞太國際私法峰會，並於二○二三年和今年在羅馬聯合舉辦研討會，以及每年向國際統一私法協會秘書處借調香港特區公私營法律專業人士。有關辦公室於明年成立後，預期將進一步鞏固律政司與國際統一私法協會未來的緊密合作關係。

國際統一私法協會首個海外辦公室落戶香港特區是香港法律樞紐發展的重要里程碑，不僅彰顯國際社會對香港特區法律體系的持續信任，更鞏固香港特區作為國際法律樞紐的領導地位。該辦公室將為國際統一私法協會在亞太地區建立穩固的實體據點，以更高效地支援其區域工作。此舉亦有助於促進「國際私法三姊妹」，即國際統一私法協會、海牙國際私法會議及聯合國國際貿易法委員會於香港法律樞紐的協調與協同效應。目前，海牙國際私法會議亞太區域辦事處及律政司與聯合國國際貿易法委員會合作項目辦公室亦設於香港。

國際統一私法協會是總部位於羅馬的獨立政府間組織，目前擁有來自五大洲的65個成員國。該組織宗旨在於研究各國及國家集團間尤以商法為重的私法現代化、協調與統一之需求與方法，並制定統一法律文獻、原則及規則以達成上述目標。"

The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, said, ""In 2025, despite considerable external challenges, Hong Kong's economy has demonstrated strong resilience and is making steady progress. The Government's efforts to reinforce and enhance Hong Kong's status and competitiveness as an international financial centre, along with its comprehensive policies to drive economic and innovation and technology (I&T) development, are beginning to bear fruit. These developments are creating favourable conditions for Hong Kong's continued advancement.

  ""2026 marks the first year of the National 15th Five-Year Plan. Key issues for the upcoming Budget will include how Hong Kong can further broaden and deepen its economic development, accelerate the nurturing and application of I&T, expedite the upgrading of industry structures, and better integrate into and contribute to national development. They also include creating more high-quality job opportunities and ensuring that the benefits of economic progress and diversification are widely shared across the community.

  ""In preparing the new Budget, we aim to gather views from different sectors, engage with the public, and draw on collective wisdom. We welcome all members of the community to actively share their views, so that we can work together to build a better and more vibrant Hong Kong.""
