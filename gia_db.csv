FEHD invites market to submit expressions of interest for future operation of Stanley Waterfront Mart,2026-02-12 12:00,2026-02-12 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200275.htm,"  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) invites the market to submit expressions of interest (EOIs) for the future operation of the Stanley Waterfront Mart today (February 12).

  Located along the Stanley Promenade, the Mart (formerly the Stanley Temporary Market) is a public market managed by the FEHD. Since commencing operation in 2007, the Mart originally housed 20 stalls offering light refreshment as well as dry and wet goods. Due to changes in the business environment and other factors, the number of tenants at the Mart has gradually decreased in recent years. At present, all long-term tenants have moved out, and the stalls are now open to interested parties for operation under short-term tenancies.

  The FEHD considers that the operating model of the Mart can be revamped by introducing a single operator management model. Through enhancing the communal seating area, setting up a pet-friendly resting area, and offering a diversified mix of dining, retail, and cultural experiences, the site can be transformed into a new venue welcomed by both the public and tourists. Through this EOI exercise, the FEHD aims to gauge whether there are parties in the market interested in operating the site and welcomes them to put forward concrete proposals on aspects such as layout design, stall mix, and other suitable operating models.

  The FEHD invites the market to submit EOIs within the coming four months. Further details are available on the FEHD website."
食環署邀請市場就赤柱海濱小賣亭未來營運提交意向書,2026-02-12 12:00,2026-02-12 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200279.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（二月十二日）邀請市場就赤柱海濱小賣亭的未來營運提交意向書。

位於赤柱海濱長廊的小賣亭屬食環署管理的公眾街市，前身為赤柱臨時街市。小賣亭由二○○七年開始營運，原設有20個攤檔，提供小食和乾濕貨。隨着營商環境轉變及其他因素影響，近年小賣亭租戶數目陸續減少，至今所有長期租戶均已遷出，現時攤檔以短期租約形式開放予有興趣人士經營。

食環署認為可以改變小賣亭的經營模式，引入單一營運者，透過優化座位空間、設置寵物友善休憩區，以及提供多元化的餐飲、零售及文化體驗，將該處打造成受市民和旅客歡迎的全新場地。署方期望透過是次邀請提交意向書的活動，了解市場是否有人士有興趣經營該場地，並歡迎他們就布局設計、攤檔組合及其他合適的營運模式等事宜提出具體建議。

食環署邀請市場在未來四個月向署方提交意向書，詳情可參閱食環署網頁。"

特區政府節慶安排跨部門工作小組發放最新資訊：農曆新年假期期間經陸路往返內地的旅客流量預測及有關安排,2026-02-12 10:35,2026-02-12 10:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200219.htm,"由政務司司長領導的節慶安排跨部門工作小組今日（二月十二日），就今年農曆新年的最新情況及安排，發放以下最新資訊：

今年農曆新年假期期間（即二月十四日至二月二十三日），入境事務處（入境處）預計約有1 138萬人次（包括香港居民及訪客）經各海、陸、空管制站進出香港。經入境處與深圳出入境邊防檢查總站（邊檢總站）等內地部門協商後，預計約有952萬人次會經各陸路邊境管制站進出香港。預計陸路出境高峰期為二月十四日（星期六），出境人次約636 000，而入境高峰期為二月二十二日（星期日），入境人次約663 000。

入境處估計假期期間羅湖管制站、落馬洲支線管制站及深圳灣管制站將會非常繁忙，預計每日平均分別約有200 000、187 000及156 000人次出入境。

今年農曆新年假期期間各口岸維持現行通關時間。落馬洲／皇崗口岸及港珠澳大橋口岸會如常24小時通關。

為疏導假期期間的旅客流量，入境處已減少前線人員休假，以便彈性調配人手，加開檢查櫃枱、臨時櫃枱及通道以疏導人流及車流。同時，入境處亦會增派保安人員協助維持旅客過關秩序。

另一方面，入境處亦會連同香港警務處、香港海關和香港鐵路有限公司在羅湖管制站成立聯合指揮中心，以作出相應的部署及採取適當措施，並與深圳邊檢總站等內地部門緊密聯繫，密切留意人流情況及在有需要時採取適當分流疏導措施，確保過關人流暢順。

入境處呼籲所有經陸路往返內地的旅客應預早計劃行程，盡量避免選擇在繁忙時段過關，並留意有關各邊境管制站交通情況的電台或電視廣播。市民及旅客亦可瀏覽保安局推出的一站式過關資訊平台「口岸通」（www.sb.gov.hk/chi/bwt/status.html?type=outbound），一次過取得各陸路邊境管制站旅客和私家車過關平均輪候時間，以及港珠澳大橋過境穿梭巴士（金巴）和落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）的平均輪候時間等有用資訊，以便計劃行程及減省等候時間。

入境處呼籲旅客在過關前往內地時，應緊記帶備身分證明文件及前往內地的有效旅行證件。香港居民出門前應檢查回鄉卡的有效日期，而香港非永久性居民則須帶同其有效的智能身份證及簽證身份書或旅行證件過關。

至於因遺失或補領身份證而獲發申請香港身份證收據的市民，或未滿十一歲而已領有香港身份證的兒童，他們應同時帶備有效的旅行證件或回港證過關。

現時入境處已在各管制站裝設約700條e-道。為進一步提升通關效率，繼調整香港永久性居民、電子往來港澳通行證持有人、中華人民共和國電子普通護照持有人及經「離境易」辦理手續的訪港旅客使用e-道服務的合資格年齡至七歲或以上後，入境處與澳門治安警察局、身份證明局及保安部隊事務局由一月十九日起調整互用自助出入境檢查服務的適用年齡，並放寬兩地使用自助登記服務機登記此服務的規定。現時，年滿十一歲或以上，並持有有效香港永久性居民身份證的香港居民，可在登記後使用澳門特別行政區（澳門特區）自助過關系統服務。在新措施下，年齡介乎七至十歲，並持有有效香港永久性居民身份證的香港居民，亦可在登記後使用澳門特區自助過關系統服務。同樣地，年齡介乎七至十歲，並持有有效澳門永久性居民身份證的澳門居民，可在登記後使用e-道自助辦理出入境手續。此外，年滿十八歲或以上，並持有有效的香港居民身份證及有效期多於九十天的香港特別行政區（香港特區）簽證身份書的香港非永久性居民，現時可在澳門指定地點登記澳門特區自助過關系統服務。在新措施下，此類人士亦可選擇使用設於香港指定管制站或各人事登記辦事處的自助登記服務機辦理登記。同時，年滿十八歲或以上持有有效澳門非永久性居民身份證及澳門居民往來香港特區旅遊證的澳門非永久性居民，亦可於澳門特區的指定地點使用自助辦證機登記e-道服務。有關e-道服務的詳情，請瀏覽：https://www.immd.gov.hk/hkt/services/immigration_clearance.html

Interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements releases latest information on cross-boundary passenger traffic estimation and arrangements for Chinese New Year festive period,2026-02-12 10:35,2026-02-12 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200209.htm,"  The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, released the following information today (February 12) on the latest situation and arrangements for the upcoming Chinese New Year festive.

  The Immigration Department (ImmD) estimates that around 11.38 million passengers (including Hong Kong residents and visitors) will pass through Hong Kong's sea, land and air control points during the upcoming Chinese New Year festive period (from February 14 to February 23). The ImmD, in consultation with the Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection and other Mainland authorities, estimates that around 9.52 million passengers will pass through land boundary control points. The number of outbound and inbound passengers using land boundary control points (BCPs) will be relatively higher on February 14 (Saturday) and February 22 (Sunday), with around 636 000 passengers and 663 000 passengers respectively.

  The ImmD estimates that the passenger traffic at the Lo Wu Control Point, the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point and the Shenzhen Bay Control Point will be heavy, with a daily average forecast of about 200 000, 187 000 and 156 000 passengers respectively.

  All BCPs will maintain the existing operating hours during this year's Chinese New Year holiday. The Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Port will maintain a 24-hour operation as usual.

  To cope with the anticipated heavy traffic during the festive period, the ImmD has minimised leave for frontline officers for flexible deployment, and operation of additional counters, temporary counters and channels. Additional security guards will also be deployed to provide crowd management support.

  Furthermore, the ImmD, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Customs and Excise Department and the MTR Corporation Limited will set up a joint command centre at the Lo Wu Control Point to make necessary arrangements. The ImmD will also establish close communication with Mainland authorities, including the Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection. To ensure a smooth passenger traffic flow, passenger conditions will be closely monitored and appropriate traffic diversion plans will be adopted when necessary.

  The ImmD advises all land boundary passengers to plan in advance, avoid making their journeys during busy periods and keep track of radio and TV broadcasts on traffic conditions at various control points. Residents and visitors may also visit ""Easy Boundary"" (www.sb.gov.hk/eng/bwt/status.html?type=outbound), a one-stop information platform on immigration clearance launched by the Security Bureau, to obtain useful information in one go, including the respective average waiting time for passengers and private cars at land BCPs, as well as for the HZMB cross-boundary shuttle bus (Gold Bus) and the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus), so as to plan their trips and save waiting time.

  For travellers making journeys to the Mainland, the ImmD reminds them to carry their proof of identity and valid travel documents for crossing the boundary. Hong Kong residents should also check the validity of their Home Visit Permits. Non-permanent residents must carry their valid smart identity card as well as their Document of Identity for Visa Purposes or valid travel document.

  Holders of the acknowledgement receipt issued due to reported loss or replacement of their Hong Kong identity cards, or children under 11 years old who hold Hong Kong identity cards, should carry a valid travel document or Re-entry Permit.

  About 700 e-Channels have been installed at various control points. To further enhance the clearance efficiency of control points, following the adjustment of the eligible age for using e-Channel service to seven or above for Hong Kong permanent residents, holders of Electronic Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao (e-EEP), holders of the People's Republic of China (PRC) electronic ordinary passports and departing visitors using ""Smart Departure"", the ImmD, in collaboration with the Public Security Police Force, the Identification Services Bureau and the Public Security Forces Affairs Bureau of Macao, with effect from January 19, has adjusted the eligible age for mutual use of automated immigration clearance services, and relaxed the requirements for the use of self-service enrolment kiosks for enrolment of such services. At present, Hong Kong residents aged 11 or above holding a valid Hong Kong permanent identity card are eligible for using the automated passenger clearance services in the Macao Special Administrative Region (Macao SAR) after enrolment. Under the new measure, Hong Kong residents agedseven to 10 holding a valid Hong Kong permanent identity card will also be eligible for using the automated passenger clearance services in the Macao SAR after enrolment. Similarly, Macao residents agedseven to 10 holding a valid Macao permanent identity card may use e-Channels to complete the automated immigration clearance after enrolment. Moreover, Hong Kong non-permanent residents aged 18 or above, holding a valid Hong Kong identity card and a valid Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Document of Identity for Visa Purposes with a validity of more than 90 days may perform the self-service enrolment for using the automated passenger clearance services in the Macao SAR at designated locations in Macao. Under the new measure, persons of this category may also perform the self-service enrolment at the enrolment kiosks installed at designated control points or at various Registration of Persons Offices in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Macao residents aged 18 or above holding a valid Macao non-permanent identity card and a valid visit permit for residents of Macao to the HKSAR may also perform the self-service enrolment for using e-Channel services at designated locations in the Macao SAR. For details of the e-Channel services, please visit:https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/immigration_clearance.html

  Hong Kong residents who require assistance while travelling outside Hong Kong may call the 24-hour hotline of the Assistance to Hong Kong Residents Unit of the ImmD at (852) 1868, call the 1868 hotline using network data or use the 1868 Chatbot via the ImmD Mobile App, send a message to 1868 WhatsApp assistance hotline or 1868 WeChat assistance hotline or submit the Online Assistance Request Form.

  The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements is tasked with holistically co-ordinating and steering the preparatory work of various government departments for welcoming visitors to Hong Kong during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland, as well as strengthening information dissemination to enable the public and visitors to plan their itineraries according to the latest situation."
S for S intends to make recommendation to CE-in-C on striking-off order against three companies relating to Apple Daily,2026-02-12 00:18,2026-02-12 00:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021101047.htm,"Following the Court of First Instance of the High Court's conviction and sentence of Apple Daily Limited, Apple Daily Printing Limited and AD Internet Limited (three companies relating to Apple Daily) for offences endangering national security, the Secretary for Security yesterday (February 11), pursuant to Article 31 of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and section 360C of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32), issued written notices to the three companies respectively, affording them an opportunity to make representations, before the Secretary for Security recommends the Chief Executive-in-Council (CE-in-C) to order the Registrar of Companies to strike the three companies off the Companies Register.

A spokesperson for the Security Bureau said, ""Lai Chee-ying and the three companies relating to Apple Daily were prosecuted with a total of three charges of offences endangering national security, including 'conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security' (contrary to Article 29 of the HKNSL and sections 159A and 159C of the Crimes Ordinance), and 'conspiracy to print, publish, sell, offer for sale, distribute, display and/or reproduce seditious publications' (contrary to sections 10, 159A and 159C of the Crimes Ordinance). The Court convicted Lai Chee-ying and the three defendant companies of all charges on December 15, 2025 and handed down sentences on February 9 this year. Amongst others, the three companies relating to Apple Daily were each sentenced to a fine of HK$3,004,500.

""The Court pointed out in its Reasons for Verdict that Lai Chee-ying closely managed and exercised hands-on control on the editorial direction of Apple Daily. Whether pre- or post- HKNSL, Lai Chee-ying utilised Apple Daily's platform to publish seditious articles, and requested foreign countries to impose sanctions or blockades or engage in other hostile activities against the People's Republic of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). The senior management of Apple Daily were fully aware of Lai Chee-ying's intention and provided support by executing his editorial directions. The conspiracies in the charges were facilitated by the three companies relating to Apple Daily, and they were knowing and willing parties to the conspiracies. The Court also held in its Reasons for Sentence that the offence of 'conspiracy to print, publish, sell, offer for sale, distribute, display and/or reproduce seditious publications' in this case fell within the most serious category for its type, and the two offences of 'conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security' fell within the category of offences of 'a grave nature'.""

""Article 31 of the HKNSL stipulates that the operation of an incorporated or unincorporated body such as a company or an organization shall be suspended or its licence or business permit shall be revoked if the body has been punished for committing an offence under that law. The HKSAR Government has a responsibility to enforce the relevant provisions in Article 31 of the HKNSL regarding the three companies relating to Apple Daily.""

""Taking into account the relevant circumstances of the case, including the conviction and seriousness of the offences committed by the three companies relating to Apple Daily, the Secretary for Security now considers that it is necessary for safeguarding national security to prohibit the operation or continued operation of these three companies in Hong Kong, and therefore intends to make a recommendation to the CE-in-C to consider exercising the power under section 360C of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32) to order the Registrar of Companies to strike the three companies relating to Apple Daily off the Companies Register.""

""The Secretary for Security has issued written notices to the three relevant companies respectively, affording them an opportunity to make written representations by February 25. When the Secretary for Security makes the relevant recommendation to the CE-in-C, the written representations submitted by the three relevant companies (if any) will be submitted together to the CE-in-C for a decision whether or not to make the order.""

""If the CE-in-C eventually decides to order the Registrar of Companies to strike the three companies relating to Apple Daily off the Companies Register, the three companies will become 'prohibited organizations'. Any person who engages in the acts specified in sections 62 to 65 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) commits an offence, including acting as an office-bearer or a member of a prohibited organization and giving aids of any kind to a prohibited organization, and is liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $1,000,000 and imprisonment for 14 years.""

The spokesperson pointed out, ""The HKSAR Government steadfastly safeguards the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people as protected under the law. Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, human rights in the city have always been robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. The HKNSL and the SNSO also clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and that the rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, shall be protected in accordance with the law. Nonetheless, just as the case with other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. The ICCPR also expressly states that some of them may be subject to restrictions as prescribed by law that are necessary for the protection of national security, public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms of others, etc.""

The spokesperson stressed, ""Safeguarding national security is a matter of fundamental importance. Endangering national security is a very serious offence. Such acts or activities may lead to extremely grave consequences. The Government of the HKSAR will, as always, resolutely, fully, and faithfully implement the HKNSL, the SNSO, and other relevant laws of the HKSAR for safeguarding national security to effectively prevent, suppress, and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law, and prohibit the operation of organizations that engage in activities endangering national security in the HKSAR."""
Speech by Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services) at Hong Kong Securities and Investment Institute Annual Dinner (English only) (with photos),2026-02-11 22:02,2026-02-11 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100892.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services), Ms Salina Yan, at the Hong Kong Securities and Investment (HKSI) Institute Annual Dinner today (February 11):

Chairman Kevin Liem (Chairperson of HKSI Institute), Chairman Dr Kelvin Wong (Chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)), Hon Robert Lee (Legislative Council Member), Tim (Honorary Fellow of HKSI Institute, Mr Tim Lui), Julia (Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the SFC, Ms Julia Leung), Yan-chee (Managing Director of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority, Mr Cheng Yan-chee), Janey (CEO of the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council, Ms Janey Lai), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 It gives me great pleasure to join you all this evening at the Annual Dinner of the Hong Kong Securities and Investment Institute. This is a good occasion to salute the Institute's achievements, and the contribution of the many avid participants of our financial services community.

Guided by its vision to champion professional standards of excellence in contributing to Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre, the HKSI Institute has become a trusted body in conducting examinations for regulated financial activities and an effective platform for promoting professional development. This is well demonstrated by the 30000 enrolments for examination it handled and the 11 per cent growth in its individual membershipin2024-25.

Driven by the same pursuit of excellence, our human capital as benchmarked against factors such as the availability of skilled personnel and level of education ranked second highest in the world in the latest edition of the Global Financial Centres Index. This helped anchor Hong Kong's standing as a leading international financial centre, third in the world and first in Asia Pacific.

Let me put this in context with the help of some big picture figures. In year 2000, Hong Kong's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) stood at HK$1,283 billion. It increased by 1.4times to HK$3,112 billion in 2024. Over the same period, the share of the financial services sector in Hong Kong's GDP increased from 12.8 per cent to 26.2 per cent, while its share in employment increased from 5.3 per cent to 7.2 per cent. Meanwhile, our stock market grew almost nine times from HK$4,862 billion in 2000 to HK$47.4 trillion in 2025 in terms of market capitalisation. The value-added function of our financial services sector is obvious.

Public policy alone cannot build a market. Yet sound policies are essential for creating a conducive environment for the healthy and enduring growth of our capital markets. To illustrate a key principle of public policy considerations, I would point to the Securities and Futures Ordinance where the regulator is given a mandate to maintain and promote the fairness, efficiency, competitiveness, transparency and orderliness of the securities and futures industry. The duality of mandate on regulation and development can also be found in the ethos of our banking, insurance, mandatory provident fund, and accounting and financial reporting regulators. This is more than a balancing act. It is a means to enable the market to create value, allocate capital for growth, respond swiftly to changes, innovate, and capture new opportunities via trusted, quality-assured and open platforms.

Openness is indeed the hallmark of Hong Kong's financial system. Thanks to prudent built-in buffers, diligent cross-agency monitoring and enforcement, alignment with international best practices and standards as well as robust institutional strengths, our financial system has overcome many tests and challenges over the years and has shown remarkable resilience and stability. The strong performance of our equity market last year with IPO funds raised regaining its world leading status is a case in point. And thanks to the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, Hong Kong's financial system continues to benefit from the rule of law, respect of contracts, free flow of capital and unique connection with the Chinese Mainland capital markets.

As for the future, uncertainties caused by geopolitics unseen for decades abound. Yet global capital and investors also see ample opportunities in this part of the world, with the Asia region providing significant sources of economic growth. In particular, the national 15th Five Year Plan provides clear pointers for societal and economic developments. Hong Kong stands ready to contribute to help realise the vision.

Along this evening's theme of ""Fostering New Opportunities"", Iwould like to share three priority areas of our work to capture the opportunities going forward.

Building Multiple Market Pillars

Hong Kong has a vibrant equity market. Average daily turnover rose more than 89 per cent year-on-year to almost HK$250 billion in 2025. Funds raised through IPOs and post-IPOs by way of placing and other means reached HK$285.8 billion and HK$358.6 billion respectively, both representing an increase of more than 200 per cent year-on-year.

From the introduction of weighted voting rights and home coming listings, admission of pre-revenue bio-tech companies and specialist tech companies, to GEM board reform and streamlining of the listing approval process with the median vetting time by the stock exchange down to 32 business days in 2025, we have adopted a reform mindset to keep our fund raising platform nimble in capturing world trends and with our feet grounded firmly on a core value: quality. We will keep enhancing the listing regime. In consultation with the Securities and Futures Commission, the HKEX (Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited) will conduct a market consultation in the first quarter of this year on specific proposals, including enhancements to the listing regime for companies with weighted voting rights.

Cash market aside, the derivatives market which is important for risk hedging and price discovery also had a record year, with 1.66 million contracts traded daily on average. The HKEX has recently adjusted the interest payments and margin collateral arrangements, thus lowering the costs of trading activities for market participants. It will soon publish measures for streamlining the issuance mechanism for structured products.

Asset and wealth management business is another pillar of strength in our financial system. From the creation of new legal vehicles such as the Limited Partnership Fund to tax concession schemes for single family offices and stamp duty waiver for REIT (real estate investment trust) unit trading, we have introduced a series of facilitative measures and attracted the presence of a critical mass of asset owners and managers. Assets under management (AUM) amounted to HK$35 trillion in 2024 and the growth momentum continued in 2025 with some HK$357 billion net fund inflows for Hong Kong-domiciled SFC authorised funds.

As shown in a survey report released yesterday, over 3380 single family offices were operating in Hong Kong in end-2025, representing a 25 per cent increase in two years. Working closely with the fund management, private equity and family office sectors, we will introduce legislative proposals to widen the coverage of fund eligible for tax exemption and streamline carried interest arrangement under the tax regime. We will also take forward legislative amendments to facilitate corporate restructuring of REITs.

Gaining perhaps less limelight but not less of our policy attention is the further development of our fixed income and currency (FIC) market. Hong Kong has solidified its position as Asia's leading international bond issuance hub, accounting for nearly 30 per cent of issuances by Asian entities. The amount of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong is top of the league in Asia, accounting for 45 per cent of the regional total. Coupled with the frequent issuances of government bonds by the Chinese Ministry of Finance and the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government as well as issuances by multilateral organisations and local corporates, Hong Kong has established a scalable FIC (fixed income and currency) ecosystem. We therefore welcome the publication of a Roadmap jointly by the SFC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) last September to position Hong Kong as a global FIC hub. The 10-point action plan, with its proposed establishment of a dedicated digital FIC trading platform connecting users with a wide range of liquidity providers, is visionary and at the same time provides practical pathways for boosting issuances and liquidity.

Added to this list of market development initiatives is the move to promote gold and commodity storage and trading in Hong Kong. We aim to upgrade our gold storage capacity to over 2000 tonnes in three years and are taking active steps to establish a central clearing system for gold trading in compliance with international standards. We have established a wholly government-owned company to serve as the governing body with its board drawing members from both the public and private sectors. The clearing system is scheduled to commence trial operation this year.

Widening Connectivity and Embracing Multilateralism

Hong Kong thrives on its hub function in many areas, notably trade, transport and aviation as well as financial services. For financial services, we are connected globally with significant participation of international players. We also have the unique advantage of connecting international investors with Chinese Mainland companies, helping them go global, and providing similar opportunities for Chinese Mainland investors on the capital market two-way street.

Since the launch of the Stock Connect Scheme in 2014, the combined southbound and northbound average daily trading turnover has grown from HK$7 billion to more than HK$330 billion in 2025. ETFs (exchange-traded funds), interest rate swaps, bonds and wealth products have been included in the respective Connect Schemes. Under Wealth Management Connect 2.0, for example, we have included brokerage houses in the network of service providers in addition to banks. To date, more than 170000 investors in the Greater Bay Area participated in the scheme involving more than RMB 131 billion of funds.

Indeed, we are actively strengthening Hong Kong's off-shore Renminbi business hub role, building on our RMB 200 billion pool of liquidity. Dim sum bond issuance hit the RMB 1trillion mark last year. RMB 85 billion of bonds have been issued under the HKSAR Government's bond programmes with tenure ranging from two to 30 years. Meanwhile, the HKMA has recently introduced the Renminbi Business Facility to allow banks to provide longer term Renminbi financing by their corporate customers for daily operations and capital expenditures in addition to trade financing. Following the introduction of the dual-counter model in the HKEX for securities listed in both HKD (Hong Kong Dollar) and Renminbi in June2023, we will introduce a bill into the Legislative Council later this year to allow the related stamp duty payments to be made also in Renminbi.

With our strong financial and legal systems honouring the spirit of a level playing field, Hong Kong appeals to corporates and groups for setting up regional and global bases. We are glad that the company redomiciliation scheme that came into effect last May has already attracted 22 successful applications with many more in the pipeline. Since 2016, qualifying corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong have been enjoying preferential tax treatment. We are keeping the scheme under review.

Likewise, we introduced a legislative framework to facilitate the issuance of Islamic bonds in Hong Kong in 2013. Admittedly, the ecosystem was not as conducive as it is now. With stepped-up outreach to the Middle East and Belt and Road economies, we are glad to see active interactions resulting in the cross listings of ETFs in each other's market and also listings of entities from Kazakhstan, Indonesia and other economies in our stock market recently. We look forward to deepening the relationship through the many cooperation initiatives.

The connection with emerging market economies will be even stronger as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is going to set up an office in Hong Kong. That vote of confidence is in line with Hong Kong's role as a green and sustainability finance hub embracing international disclosure standards and function as a sophisticated financial management centre. It is also a manifestation of the importance we attach to the operation of multilateral institutes such as the AIIB. Multilateralism provides an objective framework for economies to achieve growth through cooperation and settle disputes through civil means. For that, we look forward to welcoming APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) finance ministers to our city in October for the APEC Finance Ministers' Meeting during APEC China 2026.

Harnessing Technology and Increasing Market Efficiency

Technological advancement has been an enabler for upgrading our financial infrastructure to increase market efficiency. This is a continuously evolving journey. IPO settlements have been automated and speeded up through FINI (Fast Interface for New Issuance); thanks to all market participants' efforts, trading under severe weather has been successfully implemented since September 2024. This year, we look forward to walking the last mile to enable the full digital holding of securities by investors in their own name and paper-less transfer of titles under the uncertificated securities market mechanism.

On the societal level, the digital eMPF Platform helps automate MPF (Mandatory Provident Fund) scheme administration. Onboarding has been 98 per cent completed in terms of AUM, with 1.7 million registered users to-date. The automation has brought a 36 per cent reduction in administration fees for members. This is expected to reach 78 per cent in eight years' time.

Technology, however, is not just a passive medium playing an auxiliary role. Digital and AI-enabled technology is driving production and society transformation. It is a key driver of economic growth in itself.

This is evidenced by the fact that last year, about 70 per cent IPO funds raised were for info tech, bio tech, new energy and advanced manufacturing related companies. Last December, the HKEX Tech 100 Index tracking large and mid-cap tech companies listed in Hong Kong and eligible for Southbound Stock Connect was launched. In the digital asset space, the SFC has issued eleven licences for virtual asset trading platforms with two of them subsequently listed in Hong Kong's stock market. And three tranches of tokenized green bonds have been issued under the Government green bond programme, affirming the technical feasibility of on-chain issuances.

The twin-goal of regulation and development will continue to guide the way forward for financial innovation. Prudential and conduct regulatory requirements such as fitness and properness of personnel and segregation of client and proprietary capital are necessary safeguards for investor and user protection.

Conclusion

Ladies and gentlemen, while having the privilege of being on stage, allow me to conclude by expressing my sincere gratitude to my fellow public sector regulators and partners for their esprit de corps and hard work over the years. My thanks also go to the many distinguished private sector and industry stakeholders for your frank views and advice. The goodwill to communicate and act for the betterment of our financial market is remarkable, truly living out the spirit of proactive government and efficient market (有為政府，高效市場).

During my public service career, I have spent quite a bit of time in the financial services area that comes under the ambit of the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau. As a token of my appreciation, I would like to present to you the Chinese character ""財"" which is made up of two parts: ""貝"" or shells, the primitive form of money as a unit of account, payment and storage of value; and ""才""which gives the sound and in itself means talent, competence, and I would add, integrity. Over the centuries, the financial capital (貝) and human capital (才) have mutated into a lot of sophisticated forms or non-form. Whatever form of existence they may take, Ibelieve that the combined force of financial and human capitals will continue to drive our international financial centre journey in scaling new heights. Ithank the HKSI Institute for the honour of addressing you today, and Ruth and team for their excellent implementation of the 10-year long Asset and Wealth Management training programme. As the Year of the Horse is around the corner, I wish you a lot of horse power for your business endeavours and vitality and prosperity for all your pursuits in the days to come.

Thank you."
Speech by Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services) at Hong Kong Securities and Investment Institute Annual Dinner (English only),2026-02-11 22:02,2026-02-11 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100892.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services), Ms Salina Yan, at the Hong Kong Securities and Investment (HKSI) Institute Annual Dinner today (February 11):

Chairman Kevin Liem (Chairperson of HKSI Institute), Chairman Dr Kelvin Wong (Chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)), Hon Robert Lee (Legislative Council Member), Tim (Honorary Fellow of HKSI Institute, Mr Tim Lui), Julia (Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the SFC, Ms Julia Leung), Yan-chee (Managing Director of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority, Mr Cheng Yan-chee), Janey (CEO of the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council, Ms Janey Lai), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 It gives me great pleasure to join you all this evening at the Annual Dinner of the Hong Kong Securities and Investment Institute. This is a good occasion to salute the Institute's achievements, and the contribution of the many avid participants of our financial services community.

Guided by its vision to champion professional standards of excellence in contributing to Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre, the HKSI Institute has become a trusted body in conducting examinations for regulated financial activities and an effective platform for promoting professional development. This is well demonstrated by the 30000 enrolments for examination it handled and the 11 per cent growth in its individual membershipin2024-25.

Driven by the same pursuit of excellence, our human capital as benchmarked against factors such as the availability of skilled personnel and level of education ranked second highest in the world in the latest edition of the Global Financial Centres Index. This helped anchor Hong Kong's standing as a leading international financial centre, third in the world and first in Asia Pacific.

Let me put this in context with the help of some big picture figures. In year 2000, Hong Kong's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) stood at HK$1,283 billion. It increased by 1.4times to HK$3,112 billion in 2024. Over the same period, the share of the financial services sector in Hong Kong's GDP increased from 12.8 per cent to 26.2 per cent, while its share in employment increased from 5.3 per cent to 7.2 per cent. Meanwhile, our stock market grew almost nine times from HK$4,862 billion in 2000 to HK$47.4 trillion in 2025 in terms of market capitalisation. The value-added function of our financial services sector is obvious.

Public policy alone cannot build a market. Yet sound policies are essential for creating a conducive environment for the healthy and enduring growth of our capital markets. To illustrate a key principle of public policy considerations, I would point to the Securities and Futures Ordinance where the regulator is given a mandate to maintain and promote the fairness, efficiency, competitiveness, transparency and orderliness of the securities and futures industry. The duality of mandate on regulation and development can also be found in the ethos of our banking, insurance, mandatory provident fund, and accounting and financial reporting regulators. This is more than a balancing act. It is a means to enable the market to create value, allocate capital for growth, respond swiftly to changes, innovate, and capture new opportunities via trusted, quality-assured and open platforms.

Openness is indeed the hallmark of Hong Kong's financial system. Thanks to prudent built-in buffers, diligent cross-agency monitoring and enforcement, alignment with international best practices and standards as well as robust institutional strengths, our financial system has overcome many tests and challenges over the years and has shown remarkable resilience and stability. The strong performance of our equity market last year with IPO funds raised regaining its world leading status is a case in point. And thanks to the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, Hong Kong's financial system continues to benefit from the rule of law, respect of contracts, free flow of capital and unique connection with the Chinese Mainland capital markets.

As for the future, uncertainties caused by geopolitics unseen for decades abound. Yet global capital and investors also see ample opportunities in this part of the world, with the Asia region providing significant sources of economic growth. In particular, the national 15th Five Year Plan provides clear pointers for societal and economic developments. Hong Kong stands ready to contribute to help realise the vision.

Along this evening's theme of ""Fostering New Opportunities"", Iwould like to share three priority areas of our work to capture the opportunities going forward.

Building Multiple Market Pillars

Hong Kong has a vibrant equity market. Average daily turnover rose more than 89 per cent year-on-year to almost HK$250 billion in 2025. Funds raised through IPOs and post-IPOs by way of placing and other means reached HK$285.8 billion and HK$358.6 billion respectively, both representing an increase of more than 200 per cent year-on-year.

From the introduction of weighted voting rights and home coming listings, admission of pre-revenue bio-tech companies and specialist tech companies, to GEM board reform and streamlining of the listing approval process with the median vetting time by the stock exchange down to 32 business days in 2025, we have adopted a reform mindset to keep our fund raising platform nimble in capturing world trends and with our feet grounded firmly on a core value: quality. We will keep enhancing the listing regime. In consultation with the Securities and Futures Commission, the HKEX (Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited) will conduct a market consultation in the first quarter of this year on specific proposals, including enhancements to the listing regime for companies with weighted voting rights.

Cash market aside, the derivatives market which is important for risk hedging and price discovery also had a record year, with 1.66 million contracts traded daily on average. The HKEX has recently adjusted the interest payments and margin collateral arrangements, thus lowering the costs of trading activities for market participants. It will soon publish measures for streamlining the issuance mechanism for structured products.

Asset and wealth management business is another pillar of strength in our financial system. From the creation of new legal vehicles such as the Limited Partnership Fund to tax concession schemes for single family offices and stamp duty waiver for REIT (real estate investment trust) unit trading, we have introduced a series of facilitative measures and attracted the presence of a critical mass of asset owners and managers. Assets under management (AUM) amounted to HK$35 trillion in 2024 and the growth momentum continued in 2025 with some HK$357 billion net fund inflows for Hong Kong-domiciled SFC authorised funds.

As shown in a survey report released yesterday, over 3380 single family offices were operating in Hong Kong in end-2025, representing a 25 per cent increase in two years. Working closely with the fund management, private equity and family office sectors, we will introduce legislative proposals to widen the coverage of fund eligible for tax exemption and streamline carried interest arrangement under the tax regime. We will also take forward legislative amendments to facilitate corporate restructuring of REITs.

Gaining perhaps less limelight but not less of our policy attention is the further development of our fixed income and currency (FIC) market. Hong Kong has solidified its position as Asia's leading international bond issuance hub, accounting for nearly 30 per cent of issuances by Asian entities. The amount of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong is top of the league in Asia, accounting for 45 per cent of the regional total. Coupled with the frequent issuances of government bonds by the Chinese Ministry of Finance and the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government as well as issuances by multilateral organisations and local corporates, Hong Kong has established a scalable FIC (fixed income and currency) ecosystem. We therefore welcome the publication of a Roadmap jointly by the SFC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) last September to position Hong Kong as a global FIC hub. The 10-point action plan, with its proposed establishment of a dedicated digital FIC trading platform connecting users with a wide range of liquidity providers, is visionary and at the same time provides practical pathways for boosting issuances and liquidity.

Added to this list of market development initiatives is the move to promote gold and commodity storage and trading in Hong Kong. We aim to upgrade our gold storage capacity to over 2000 tonnes in three years and are taking active steps to establish a central clearing system for gold trading in compliance with international standards. We have established a wholly government-owned company to serve as the governing body with its board drawing members from both the public and private sectors. The clearing system is scheduled to commence trial operation this year.

Widening Connectivity and Embracing Multilateralism

Hong Kong thrives on its hub function in many areas, notably trade, transport and aviation as well as financial services. For financial services, we are connected globally with significant participation of international players. We also have the unique advantage of connecting international investors with Chinese Mainland companies, helping them go global, and providing similar opportunities for Chinese Mainland investors on the capital market two-way street.

Since the launch of the Stock Connect Scheme in 2014, the combined southbound and northbound average daily trading turnover has grown from HK$7 billion to more than HK$330 billion in 2025. ETFs (exchange-traded funds), interest rate swaps, bonds and wealth products have been included in the respective Connect Schemes. Under Wealth Management Connect 2.0, for example, we have included brokerage houses in the network of service providers in addition to banks. To date, more than 170000 investors in the Greater Bay Area participated in the scheme involving more than RMB 131 billion of funds.

Indeed, we are actively strengthening Hong Kong's off-shore Renminbi business hub role, building on our RMB 200 billion pool of liquidity. Dim sum bond issuance hit the RMB 1trillion mark last year. RMB 85 billion of bonds have been issued under the HKSAR Government's bond programmes with tenure ranging from two to 30 years. Meanwhile, the HKMA has recently introduced the Renminbi Business Facility to allow banks to provide longer term Renminbi financing by their corporate customers for daily operations and capital expenditures in addition to trade financing. Following the introduction of the dual-counter model in the HKEX for securities listed in both HKD (Hong Kong Dollar) and Renminbi in June2023, we will introduce a bill into the Legislative Council later this year to allow the related stamp duty payments to be made also in Renminbi.

With our strong financial and legal systems honouring the spirit of a level playing field, Hong Kong appeals to corporates and groups for setting up regional and global bases. We are glad that the company redomiciliation scheme that came into effect last May has already attracted 22 successful applications with many more in the pipeline. Since 2016, qualifying corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong have been enjoying preferential tax treatment. We are keeping the scheme under review.

The event coincided with the visit of the Hong Kong, China delegation to the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games.

In her welcome remarks, the Special Representative for Hong Kong Economic and Trade Affairs to the European Union, Ms Shirley Yung, expressed support for the Hong Kong athletes taking part in the Winter Olympics. She highlighted that the perseverance shown by athletes in overcoming challenges mirrors Hong Kong's economic resilience in the face of global uncertainties, as evidenced by the city's strong performance last year.

Noting that 2025 had been a fruitful year of bilateral exchange between Hong Kong and Italy, she encouraged businesses to build on the momentum of recent campaigns, including the ""Think Business, Think Hong Kong"" event in Milan and Italy's strong showcase at the ""Business of Design Week"" in Hong Kong, to further strengthen business partnership. ""With a unique blend of East and West, Hong Kong is a city alive with arts and culture, sports and entertainment. From our world-class museums, stadiums, and dynamic arts scene to centuries-old traditions woven into daily life, Hong Kong offers a rich cultural diversity, creativity and vibrancy."" she said, adding that Hong Kong attracted nearly 50 million visitors in 2025, a strong increase of 12 per cent from the previous year.

During the reception, Brussels ETO invited the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra Ensemble to perform a programme featuring festive folk melodies and a medley of iconic Hong Kong television drama themes. The performance showcased the outstanding talents of Hong Kong musicians and the city's distinctive East-meets-West cultural character, which was greatly received by the local guests.

Co-organised by Brussels ETO, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and Invest Hong Kong, the reception in Milan was attended by over 150 guests from the government, business, sports, art and culture, as well as representatives of the Hong Kong, China Winter Olympics delegation, including the President of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC), Dr Timothy Fok; the Honorary Secretary General of the SF&OC, Mr Edgar Yang; and Honorary Deputy Secretary General of SF&OC and the Chef de Mission of the Hong Kong, China Delegation, Mr Wong Po-kee."
保安局局長擬建議行政長官會同行政會議命令剔除《蘋果日報》相關三間公司的註冊,2026-02-11 20:41,2026-02-11 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100854.htm,"​繼高等法院原訟法庭裁定蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果日報互聯網有限公司（《蘋果日報》相關三間公司）危害國家安全罪行罪名成立及作出判刑後，保安局局長今日（二月十一日）按《香港國安法》第三十一條及《公司（清盤及雜項條文）條例》（第32章）第360C條展開相關程序，分別向《蘋果日報》相關三間公司發出書面通知，讓該三間公司可在保安局局長向行政長官會同行政會議提交建議命令公司註冊處處長將該三間公司自公司登記冊中剔除之前作出申述。

保安局發言人指出︰「黎智英和《蘋果日報》相關三間公司被控共三項危害國家安全罪行，控罪包括『串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪』（違反《香港國安法》第二十九條、《刑事罪行條例》第159A及159C條）及『串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及／或複製煽動刊物罪』（違反《刑事罪行條例》第10條、第159A及159C條）。法庭在二○二五年十二月十五日裁定黎智英和三間被告公司全部控罪罪名成立。及後，法庭在今年二月九日就案件作出判刑。其中，《蘋果日報》三間相關公司各被判罰款3,004,500港元。」

「法庭在裁決理由書中指出，黎智英密切管理《蘋果日報》並控制其編採方向；不論在《香港國安法》實施前或後，黎智英均利用《蘋果日報》的平台發布煽動文章，以及請求外國對中國和香港特區進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動；《蘋果日報》高層人員對黎智英的意圖完全知情，並提供支持，落實黎智英的編採指示；控罪所指的串謀，得到《蘋果日報》相關三間公司的配合，它們是知情並願意參與其中的。法庭亦在判刑理由書中指出，本案的『串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及／或複製煽動刊物罪』屬於最嚴重的級別；而兩項『串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪』，屬於罪行重大。」

「《香港國安法》第三十一條訂明，公司、團體等法人或者非法人組織因犯該法規定的罪行受到刑事處罰的，應責令其暫停運作或者吊銷其執照或者營業許可證。特區政府有責任就《蘋果日報》相關三間公司執行《香港國安法》第三十一條的相關規定。」

「考慮到案件的所有相關情況，包括《蘋果日報》相關三間公司的定罪以及其所犯罪行的嚴重性，保安局局長現認為基於維護國家安全所需應禁止三間公司在香港運作或繼續運作，因此擬建議行政長官會同行政會議考慮行使《公司（清盤及雜項條文）條例》（第32章）第360C條的權力，命令公司註冊處處長將《蘋果日報》三間相關公司自公司登記冊中剔除。」

「保安局局長已向該三間相關公司分別發出書面通知，讓其在二月二十五日限期之前作出書面陳述。在保安局局長向行政長官會同行政會議提交相關建議時，亦會將《蘋果日報》三間相關公司提交的申述（如有）提交，供其一併考慮以決定是否作出有關命令。」

CHP reminds public to avoid consuming raw oysters and undercooked bivalve shellfish for the time being to prevent norovirus infection,2026-02-11 19:00,2026-02-11 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100758.htm,"In view of the recent surge in norovirus food poisoning cases linked to the consumption of raw oysters, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (February 11) reiterated its call for the public to stay alert and maintain good personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times. The public, especially the elderly, pregnant women, children and those with weakened immune systems, should refrain from consuming raw oysters and undercooked bivalve shellfish as they are at higher risk of developing complications (such as dehydration) if infected with norovirus.

""The number of food poisoning cases recorded over the past few weeks has continued to rise, increasing from an average of one case per week in late December to an average of four cases per week in January. From January 18 to February 10, the CHP recorded 39 food poisoning cases, affecting 44 males and 75 females aged between 15 and 75. Nearly 90 per cent (35 cases) were associated with norovirus, affecting 105 persons. Epidemiological investigations showed that all the individuals affected by the abovementioned food poisoning cases related to norovirus had consumed raw oysters during the incubation period. Six of them required hospitalisation. All are in stable condition. The CHP has notified the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of all food poisoning cases for appropriate follow-up and source tracing. Investigations are ongoing,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""As oysters feed by filtering a large volume of seawater, pathogens can accumulate in them if they are grown in or harvested from contaminated water. Raw or undercooked oysters are considered a high-risk food. Persons who consume contaminated or undercooked oysters may contract food-borne diseases, such as norovirus, hepatitis A virus or other bacteria. During the Lunar New Year, people usually gather for meals with relatives and friends. I particularly remind the public that only thoroughly cooked food, especially shellfish, should be consumed, whether dining at home or in restaurants, to avoid contracting enteric diseases. Norovirus cannot be killed by alcoholic beverages, lemon juice or wasabi. When cooking oysters in a hot pot or on the grill, ensure that they are thoroughly cooked to effectively minimise the risk of norovirus infection. Given the recent increase in norovirus activity and epidemiological data indicating that most food poisoning cases are related to raw oyster consumption, the CFS of the FEHD is investigating the source of raw oysters. Hence, members of the public should not take the risk of consuming undercooked oysters,"" Dr Tsui explained.

""It is worth noting that norovirus is highly contagious. Individuals infected with norovirus through contaminated food can spread the virus to others through person-to-person contact or environment contaminated by vomitus. In addition to causing food poisoning, norovirus is also one of the primary causes of acute gastroenteritis (AGE). According to our surveillance data, the AGE activity level in Hong Kong has been rising since early January. The latest data showed that, as of February 10, a total of 38 AGE outbreaks in institutions and schools were recorded so far this year, involving 294 persons. Laboratory testing indicated that over 75 per cent of the outbreaks were caused by norovirus. Additionally, norovirus activity has increased in other popular travel destinations for Hong Kong citizens, including Japan and Korea. Surveillance data from Korea showed that the norovirus activity has reached its highest level in nearly five years for this time of year. Members of the public should remain vigilant and maintain good personal, environmental and food hygiene when travelling abroad and pay attention to minimise the risk of infection,"" Dr Tsui added.

To prevent AGE and norovirus infection, members of the public should perform hand hygiene frequently. Since alcohol is not effective in killing norovirus, alcohol-based handrubs are not a substitute for handwashing with soap and water, especially before handling food or eating, and after using the toilet. Wash hands with liquid soap and water, and rub for at least 20 seconds. Then rinse with water and dry with a disposable paper towel or hand dryer.

Members of the public may visit the CHP's dedicated webpages for the prevention of Norovirus Infection and Viral Gastroenteritis."

Law and order situation in Hong Kong in 2025 (with photos),2026-02-11 18:35,2026-02-11 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100763.htm,"The law and order situation in Hong Kong in 2025 is as follows:

1. Overall situation

A total of 89 137 crimes were recorded in 2025, representing a decrease of 5.9% (-5 610 cases) compared with 2024. The number of violent crimes dropped by 15.9% (-1 662 cases) to 8 823 cases.

The vast majority of major crimes recorded decreases, including robbery, burglary, rape, indecent assault, wounding and serious assault, theft, criminal damage, blackmail, youth crime and triad-related crimes. Deception also registered a slight decrease (-2.9%).

Crimes that recorded increases included homicide, serious drug offences and missing motor vehicles.

2. Deception

Over the past few years, Police have stepped up efforts to combat deception. Although the number of cases remained high in 2025, totalling 43 212 cases, the figure represented a slight decrease of 2.9% (-1 268 cases) compared with 2024. This marked the first decline, following consecutive annual rises in deception figures since 2019. Monetary losses also decreased, dropping from approximately $9.2 billion to about $8.1 billion, a decline of 11.3% (-$1.03 billion).

Deception cases accounted for nearly half of all reported crimes (48.5%). Among the various categories, e-shopping fraud (12 505 cases, +946 cases, +8.2%) was the most prevalent, accounting for 28.9% of all deception cases. Police noted that e-shopping fraud related to concert tickets increased significantly following the opening of the Kai Tak Sports Park in March 2025. A total of 2 805 cases were recorded last year, representing a year-on-year increase of 61.8% (+1 071 cases).

Online investment fraud accounted for the highest monetary loss, with 5 135 cases recorded, registering an increase of 30.7% (+1 205 cases). The total loss amount involved reached $3.58 billion, representing a rise of 58.4% (+$1.32 billion). While accounting for 11.9% of all deception cases, online investment fraud constituted 44.1% of the total monetary loss, with the average loss per case rising from about $580,000 in 2024 to about $700,000 in 2025.

There were 4 095 cases of online employment fraud, an increase of 6.3% (+242 cases). Most of these were “click farming” scams (96.5%), in which fraudsters falsely claimed that commissions could be earned by making advance payments to boost sales figures. In contrast, telephone deception recorded 8 621 cases, a decrease of 6.3% (-583 cases). This decline included a 20.4% drop in telephone deception cases involving “impersonating customer service”, a tactic that first appeared in 2024, which accounted for 4 440 cases (-1 135 cases). Phishing scams and “compensated dating scams” recorded 1 093 cases (-1 638 cases) and 1 122 cases (-907 cases) respectively, registering a 60% and 44.7% drop.

Four major strategies

Fraudulent activities have become highly industrialised, characterised by a sophisticated division of labour and a cross-border nature. To combat these scams, both local measures and cross-border collaboration are indispensable. Accordingly, Police have formulated four major strategic directions.

Combating fraud industry chains

The first strategy focuses on dismantling fraud industry chains. The priority is to tackle the use of telecommunications networks for fraudulent purposes at the source. In June 2025, the Hong Kong Police Force conducted a joint operation with its Singaporean counterpart, arresting eight persons suspected of using 400 000 Hong Kong mobile SIM cards to generate massive volumes of scam calls. In response, the working group established by Police, the Office of the Communications Authority and the telecommunications sector has been actively studying and implementing various countermeasures. Notably, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau will submit a legislative proposal in 2026, which includes lowering the registration limit for pre-paid SIM cards per user and introducing new offences targeting their improper use.

To tackle the downstream activities of fraud industry chains, Police are prioritising the crackdown on stooge accounts used to collect illicit proceeds. Apart from strengthening enforcement, expediting prosecutions and seeking enhanced sentencing, Police and the banking sector are actively exploring ways to prevent the opening of stooge accounts. With the new legislation allowing bank-to-bank information sharing on suspicious personal accounts coming into effect in late 2025, and the official launch of the upgraded version of the Police-bank information sharing platform, FINEST, on December 15, 2025, interbank information sharing has recorded a multi-fold increase. Participation is also set to expand from 10 to all 28 retail banks.

Furthermore, Police partnered with the banking sector to launch the “Upstream Scam Intervention” scheme in 2023. By analysing the transaction patterns of stooge accounts, officers proactively contacted potential victims to dissuade them from transferring further funds to fraudsters. In 2025, Police successfully intervened in 4 060 deception cases (+69.4%) and intercepted fraudulent payments totalling $480 million, representing a more than 1.5-fold increase (+158.4%) compared with 2024. The total monetary loss from deception cases in 2025 fell by $1.03 billion, with the successful interventions under this scheme accounting for nearly half of the decline.

In addition to combating stooge accounts, the Virtual Asset Intelligence Taskforce, mentioned in last year’s Policy Address, was established in October 2025. Chairing the taskforce, Police will strengthen intelligence exchange with the Customs and Excise Department, regulators, and industry partners to jointly combat virtual asset-related crimes. Key priorities include optimising the stop-payment mechanism to further clamp down on criminals using cryptocurrency to collect crime proceeds and launder money.

Targeted publicity

The second major direction is targeted publicity aimed at achieving precision in scam prevention. Last year, Police identified Mainland students and the elderly as key targets for publicity and allocated more resources to enhance the anti-scam awareness of these two high-risk groups.

The monetary loss incurred by Mainland students in telephone deception was 2.9 times higher than that of local students, averaging approximately $690,000 and $176,000 respectively. In response, Police carried out extensive publicity and educational work in 2025 to prevent Mainland students from falling victim to telephone deception. These efforts included conducting surveys, seminars, and arranging campus visits by the anti-scam icecream van, etc. Through these year-long efforts, Police noted an improvement in the situation regarding their involvement in telephone deception. The number of cases and the amount of loss decreased by 9.2% and 16.9% respectively.

However, it was also observed that the number of cases and the amount of loss involving Mainland students in investment fraud surged by 3.6 times (+362.5%) and 6.5 times (+649.6%) respectively. For the general public as a whole, the total loss from online investment fraud was the highest among all deception categories (accounting for 44.1%). Therefore, Police will adjust the key publicity focus in 2026 by shifting the priority from Mainland students to combatting investment fraud, with a view to deploying resources flexibly to maximise crime prevention effectiveness.

Separately, online investment fraud caused substantial losses, with one-third ($1.18 billion) involving virtual assets. Many victims incurred losses after downloading fake mobile applications created by fraudsters and depositing funds for investment. To counter this modus operandi, relevant prevention tips have been provided on “Scameter+”, and Police will continue to conduct targeted publicity.

Furthermore, in 80% (80.4%) of investment fraud cases, victims were contacted by fraudsters via individual mainstream social media platforms and instant messaging applications. Police will enhance communication with the relevant companies, expecting them not only to co-operate more effectively with police investigations by providing information and removing fraudulent accounts and posts, but also to be more proactive in identifying suspicious accounts and posts to expedite blocking.

Regarding the elderly, the number of victims has risen across various categories of deception. In particular, “Guess Who” telephone deception saw both the number of cases and the amount of loss surge by over 50% (+58.1% and +52.8% respectively). As many elderly victims were swindled out of their savings and pensions, Police will continue to prioritise the elderly in its publicity efforts, including organising a series of anti-deception activities and producing and broadcasting promotional videos.

Promoting greater use of “Scameter+”

Thirdly, Police will intensify the promotion of “Scameter+”. Although downloads reached 1.15 million by the end of 2025, the penetration rate still leaves room for improvement. Consequently, Police launched new features for “Scameter+” in October 2025, including automatic user database updates and expanded reporting categories covering SMS and instant messaging applications. New artificial intelligence technology was also introduced to analyse suspicious website links and webpage screenshots reported by the public to detect the impersonation of banks, couriers, investment platforms and others. Once confirmed as malicious, these websites are instantly added to the database to block access for all users.

Following the launch of these new features, public reports of suspicious phone numbers and websites surged by about 60% and about 50% respectively; the number of suspicious phone numbers and websites added to the database doubled; furthermore, “Scameter+” proactively identified and blocked 267 scam domains not yet reported by the public. Compared to the pre-upgrade period, the number of searches on “Scameter+” rose by 17.6%, while alerts issued by the app surged by 66.5%, exceeding 130 000 in December 2025 alone. Police also requested telecommunications operators to intercept suspicious calls and websites. This timely intervention prevented the public from accessing fraudulent messages and led to a significant drop in phishing scams (-60%).

International collaboration

Police are actively promoting and participating in international co-operation to combat cross-border fraud more effectively. To this end, Police established the Cross-border Anti-Scam Collaboration Platform, “FRONTIER+”, with various countries/regions at the end of 2024. Its first joint operation in 2025 resulted in over 1 800 arrests.

The platform now comprises 13 members. Police will continue inviting other countries/regions to join, with a view to enhancing effectiveness in intelligence exchange, interception of scam proceeds and joint enforcement actions. While attending the INTERPOL General Assembly in Morocco in late November 2025, the Commissioner of Police held in-depth discussions with representatives from various countries to explore ways to strengthen co-operation. As the 2026 General Assembly will be held in Hong Kong for the first time, Police will seize the opportunity to strengthen collaboration and exchanges with different countries and regions to jointly tackle cross-border crimes.

3. Homicide

There were 194 cases of homicide, including the 168 deaths caused by the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, which was classified as manslaughter. Police have so far arrested 16 persons for manslaughter in connection with the fire.

Of the remaining 26 cases, 16 (61.5%) involved domestic or family violence, compared with 10 such cases in 2024. Among all cases, only one case remained undetected; this involved a 49-year-old non-ethnic Chinese (NEC) woman who was killed in June 2025. Police are making every effort to bring the suspect, who remains at large, to justice.

4. Wounding and serious assault

There were 3 363 cases of wounding and serious assault, representing a decrease of 6.9% (-251 cases). Of these, 8.3% were triad-related. Police paid particular attention to cases involving triads and NEC persons (i.e. the number of NEC persons arrested for wounding and serious assault), which decreased by 10.3% and 9% respectively.

5. Robbery

There were 66 robbery cases, a decrease of 26.7% (-24 cases). This marked the lowest figure since records began in 1969, averaging one case every 5.5 days. The detection rate reached a high of 90.9%.

During the period, there were no robberies involving genuine firearms or stun guns. One bank robbery and two robberies involving large amounts of cash were all detected within a short period. With the aid of closed-circuit television (CCTV), an important investigative tool, and the dedicated and persistent investigation by Police officers, Police swiftly identified the suspects and successfully arrested them.

Intelligence work was also crucial to Police’s effective combat against robbery. In November 2025, acting on intelligence, Police laid an ambush in Hung Hom and arrested eight suspects attempting to rob the victims of 38 kg of gold dust with beef knives.

6. Burglary

A total of 816 burglary cases were recorded, representing a decrease of 33.1% (-404 cases). This was also a new historical low since 1969.

In 2025, Police began deploying drones for anti-burglary operations on high-risk days during long holidays. Consequently, burglary figures during the Easter and summer holidays dropped by 50% and 30.2% respectively. During the recent Christmas period, Police continued these operations, resulting in a 23.9% decrease in cases. Moving forward, Police will continue to deploy drones for anti-burglary operations during long holidays, such as the Chinese New Year.

7. Theft

A total of 20 032 theft cases were recorded, representing a decline of 10.7% (-2 401 cases). Most categories recorded decreases, including miscellaneous theft (-9.7%) and shop theft (-9.6%), while pickpocketing saw a significant drop of 56.3%. Notably, the figures for snatching (-23.4%) and theft from vehicles (-17.2%) reached their lowest levels since records began in 1969 and 1977 respectively.

Missing motor vehicles, however, recorded an increase. A total of 440 vehicles were involved, registering an increase of 51 vehicles (+13.1%). Half of these cases (220 vehicles) occurred in New Territories North (NTN) , an area characterised by its vast coverage and numerous rural and remote locations. Private cars and motorcycles accounted for over 80% (81.6%) of the total. Among the 440 missing motor vehicles, 24.1% were unauthorised use of vehicles taken from family members, friends, or car rental companies, etc.; 10.5% were taken for driving without a driving licence; and another 11.1% were used for committing crimes, primarily drug trafficking. Overall, 60.2% of the missing motor vehicles were recovered.

To combat the rise in vehicle theft, Police conducted multiple intelligence-led operations last year, arresting 44 persons and recovering 28 missing motor vehicles. Since July 2025, Police have also deployed drones to conduct aerial patrols at black spots for vehicle theft in NTN to enhance deterrence. Following months of enforcement actions, the increase in missing motor vehicle figures has gradually narrowed, slowing from a 53.5% increase in the first half of 2025 to a 13.1% increase for the whole year.

8. Blackmail

A total of 1 674 blackmail cases were recorded, representing a decrease of 44.8% (-1 357 cases). Of these, 78.4% were related to “naked chat” (1 312 cases), representing a drop of 46.1% (-1 122 cases).

Police noted that the proportion of students among victims rose from 18.7% in 2024 to 27.4%. In view of this, Police continued to enhance publicity and education efforts, including the publication of a new edition of the Youth Crime Prevention Booklet in September 2025, and the release of “Letters to Parents” on the “CyberDefender” website covering topics such as online child sexual grooming and the prevention of online sextortion.

9. Sexual offences

There were 68 rape cases, a decrease of nine cases (-11.7%). The detection rate stood at 95.6%. During the period, there was one case involving a stranger, which was detected.

A total of 1 137 cases of indecent assault were recorded, representing a drop of 48 cases (-4.1%). The detection rate was 78.9%.

Police have been closely monitoring the situation regarding sexual offences and no specific trend has been observed at this stage.

10. Serious drug offences

There were 1 281 serious drug cases, representing an increase of 15% (+167 cases). Cases involving etomidate accounted for 29.4% (376 cases).

Etomidate has become the most commonly abused drug overall and among youths, followed by cocaine and cannabis. Since etomidate was listed as a dangerous drug in February 2025, Police recorded 911 cases involving etomidate by the end of the year, resulting in 1 134 arrests, including 205 youths.

By the end of 2025, sentences had been handed down in 47 etomidate cases. Of these, 41 were cases of “possession of a dangerous drug”, with a maximum sentence of six months’ imprisonment, while the remaining six were cases of “trafficking in a dangerous drug”, resulting in imprisonment terms of up to 24 months. Police will closely monitor court sentences and maintain close communication with the Department of Justice to explore seeking appropriate sentencing guidelines from the court for etomidate as an emerging drug.

In August 2025, Police launched a 24-hour etomidate reporting hotline (6629 2966) as well as WhatsApp and WeChat accounts, which received 54 reports by the end of the year. The Government has also included etomidate in the “Healthy School Programme” for the 2025/26 school year to assist schools with early identification and the provision of counselling and support.

Believing that prevention is better than cure, Police will continue efforts in anti-drug education. In 2025, Police held 32 seminars and set up booths to share the latest anti-drug information with nearly 30 000 teachers. In 2026, Police will tour primary schools across various districts to stage 60 anti-drug drama performances. Furthermore, the Leadership Institute on Narcotics has launched its fifth cohort, receiving applications from 67 secondary schools, the highest number in the programme's history.

11. Triad-related crimes

A total of 1 944 triad-related crimes were recorded, representing a decrease of 16.4% (-381 cases).

Police remain committed to combating triad activities by mounting enforcement and intelligence-led operations, focusing specifically on targeting triad sources of income. In 2025, Police conducted the annual “THUNDERBOLT” operation in collaboration with the police authorities of Guangdong and Macao. A total of 4 140 persons were arrested in Hong Kong, with the seizure of cash and drugs worth approximately $550 million.

Separately, after several years of investigation and evidence gathering, Police conducted an enforcement operation in July 2025, arresting 82 members of a triad syndicate, including the ringleader, his family members and accomplices. During the operation, over $8 million in cash was seized, and illicit funds amounting to $1.13 billion were frozen. Subsequently, in August, Police dismantled the syndicate's organised cross-border prostitution operation and arrested 67 persons, including over 40 sex workers from various places. Police operations are ongoing.

12. Youth crime

In 2025, a total of 2 662 youths were arrested for criminal offences, representing a decrease of 6.3% (-178 persons). This marked the lowest figure on record since 1990, indicating that Police and various community sectors had achieved tangible results through sustained efforts to prevent and combat youth crime.

13. Relevant situation of national security

Since the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance came into force, the National Security Department of Police had arrested a total of 385 persons as at the end of 2025. More than half of them had been charged.

14. Conclusion

  In 2025, the overall crime figure registered a drop (-5.9%). The vast majority of major crimes recorded decreases; in particular, the figures for robbery (-26.7%) and burglary (-33.1%) were the lowest on record.

Following the implementation of the SmartView project, the detection rates for various street crimes rose by 2.5 to 22.8 percentage points, while crime figures dropped by 3.1% to 71.8%. This demonstrates that the SmartView project has had a highly positive impact on crime prevention and detection, contributing to the continued stability of Hong Kong’s overall law and order situation.

2025年香港整體治安情況（附圖）,2026-02-11 18:27,2026-02-11 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100756.htm,"2025年香港整體治安情況如下：

1. 整體形勢

2025年，全港共錄得89 137宗罪案，較2024年下跌5.9%（-5 610宗），暴力罪案有8 823宗，跌15.9%（-1 662宗）。

絕大部分的主要罪案錄得下跌，如行劫、爆竊、強姦、非禮、傷人及嚴重毆打、盜竊、刑事毀壞、勒索、青少年及三合會相關罪案等。詐騙案亦輕微下跌（-2.9%）。

錄得上升的罪案有兇殺、嚴重毒品罪行及失車。

2. 詐騙案

警隊於過去數年致力打擊詐騙案，雖然2025年的案件數字仍然高企，共43 212宗，但較2024年輕微下跌2.9%（-1 268宗），這亦是自2019年詐騙案數字逐年上升後首次下跌。損失金額亦錄得跌幅，由約92億元減少至約81億元，跌11.3%（-10.3億元）。

詐騙案佔整體罪案近一半（48.5%），各分類中佔最多為網上購物騙案，有12 505宗，上升946宗（+8.2%），佔28.9%。警方留意到自啟德體育園在去年三月開幕，涉及演唱會門票的網購騙案明顯增加，去年共有2 805宗，按年升61.8%（+1 071宗）。

損失金額最高是網上投資騙案，有5 135宗，升30.7%（+1 205宗），涉及損失達35.8億元，升58.4%（+13.2億元）。網上投資騙案佔整體騙案11.9%，但損失金額佔44.1%，平均每宗案件的損失由2024年的58萬元升至2025年的70萬元。

網上求職騙案有4 095宗，升6.3%（+242宗），大多數為「刷單」騙案（96.5%），即騙徒訛稱先付款「刷單」購物可賺佣金。至於電話騙案則有8 621宗，跌6.3%（-583宗），其中於2024年開始出現的「假冒客服」手法跌20.4%（-1 135宗）至4 440宗。釣魚騙案及「援交騙案」分別佔1 093宗（-1 638宗）及1 122宗（-907宗），跌幅分別為60%及44.7%。

四大策略

詐騙活動高度產業化，分工細密，且具跨境特性。要打擊騙案，本地措施與跨境協作缺一不可。因此，警隊已訂立四大方向：

打擊詐騙產業鏈

第一是打擊詐騙產業鏈。首先要從源頭打擊利用電訊網絡行騙。香港警方與新加坡警方於2025年六月進行聯合行動，拘捕八人，涉嫌以40萬張香港電話卡打出大量詐騙電話行騙。因此，警方與通訊事務管理局辦公室及業界成立的工作小組一直不斷研究並實施不同措施，包括商務及經濟發展局將於2026年內提交立法建議，包括降低個人登記電話儲值卡數目的上限，及訂立新罪行打擊不當使用電話卡。

針對產業鏈的下游部分，警隊重點打擊用作收取騙款的傀儡戶口。除了加強執法、加快檢控、加重刑罰外，警方與銀行業界積極探討如何防止開立傀儡戶口。隨着容許銀行分享可疑個人帳戶資料的新法例於2025年年底生效，以及警方與銀行業界的訊息交換平台FINEST升級版於去年十二月十五日正式推出，銀行間的信息共享錄得倍數上升，參與的銀行數目亦即將由10間擴展至所有28間零售銀行。

警方自2023年起與銀行聯手推出「騙案預警」計劃，透過分析傀儡戶口的交易，主動聯絡潛在詐騙受害人，說服他們停止繼續轉帳予騙徒。2025年，警方成功勸阻4 060宗騙案（+69.4%），阻截騙款達4.8億元，較2024年升超過1.5倍（+158.4%）。2025年整體騙案的損失金額下跌10.3億元，即近一半的跌幅來自此計劃成功減少的損失。

除打擊傀儡戶口外，去年《施政報告》提及的虛擬資產情報工作組已於2025年十月成立。作為工作組主席，警方會透過工作組強化與海關、監管機構及業界的情報交流，共同打擊虛擬資產相關罪案，重點包括優化止付流程，進一步打擊罪犯以加密貨幣收取贓款及清洗黑錢。

重點宣傳

第二個大方向是重點宣傳，以達致精準防騙。警隊於去年將內地學生及長者定為重點宣傳對象，投放較多資源提升此兩個高危群組的防騙意識。

內地學生在電話騙案中的損失金額較本地生高2.9倍，平均分別約為69萬元及17.6萬元。因此，警方在2025年以預防內地生成為電話騙案受害人進行大量宣傳教育工作，包括進行問卷調查、舉辦講座、安排防騙雪糕車入校園等。經過整年努力，警方留意到內地生涉及電話騙案的情況有所改善，案件數字及損失金額分別跌9.2%及16.9%。

然而，警方同時留意到內地生涉及投資騙案的案件數字及損失金額分別急升3.6倍（+362.5%）及6.5倍（+649.6%）；就廣大市民而言，網上投資騙案的總損失亦為各騙案類別中最高（佔44.1%）。因此，警隊2026年將調整重點宣傳項目，以投資騙案取代內地生作重點宣傳目標，務求靈活運用資源，達到最大防罪效果。

另外，網上投資騙案的損失龐大，當中三分一（11.8億元）涉及虛擬資產，不少受害人下載騙徒製作的虛假流動應用程式，存入款項進行投資，招致損失。針對這類手法，「防騙視伏App」已提供相關防騙「貼士」，警方會繼續作重點宣傳。

此外，投資騙案當中，八成（80.4%）受害人經個別主流社交媒體平台和即時通訊軟件遭騙徒接觸，警方會加強與有關公司溝通，希望它們除了更好配合警方調查，提供資料及將詐騙帳戶及帖文下架外，亦應更主動辨識可疑帳戶及帖文，加快作出封鎖。

至於長者方面，由於他們在多個騙案類別中被騙的數字均有所上升，尤其在「猜猜我是誰」電話騙案中，案件數字及損失金額均升超過五成（分別+58.1%及+52.8%），不少長者更被騙去積蓄及退休金，因此，警隊會維持以長者作為重點宣傳對象，舉辦連串的防騙活動、製作及播放宣傳片等。

加強使用「防騙視伏App」

第三，警方會加強推廣「防騙視伏App」。雖然「防騙視伏App」的下載量至2025年底已達115萬，但滲透率仍有待加強。因此，警方於2025年十月推出新功能，包括自動更新用戶的數據庫、新增舉報種類，包括SMS短訊、即時通訊軟件等。全新的人工智能技術亦會透過分析市民舉報的可疑網址及網站截圖，偵測假冒的銀行、速遞、投資平台等，並將有關網頁即時納入資料庫，為所有用戶作出封鎖。

在新功能推出後，公眾舉報的可疑電話號碼及網址數量分別大增約60%及一半；納入資料庫的可疑電話號碼及網址數量升一倍，更主動找出267個仍未有市民舉報的詐騙域名並進行封鎖。「防騙視伏App」的搜尋次數較升級前升17.6%，發出警示的數字更升66.5%，單在2025年十二月已經超過13萬次。警方亦會要求電訊商攔截可疑電話號碼及網址，及時阻止市民接觸到詐騙訊息，釣魚騙案亦因而大幅下跌（-60%）。

國際合作

警方一直積極推動和參與國際合作，以更有效打擊跨境詐騙。就此，警隊於2024年底與多個國家／地區成立反詐騙跨境合作平台「FRONTIER+」，2025年首次進行聯合行動，拘捕超過1 800人。

現時平台成員已增加至13個，警方會繼續邀請其他國家／地區加入，以加強在情報交流、攔截騙款及聯合執法方面的成效。警務處處長於2025年十一月底在摩洛哥出席國際刑警組織周年大會期間，亦與不同國家的代表深入交流，探討如何加強合作。2026年的周年大會將首次在香港舉行，警隊會抓緊機會強化與不同國家和地區的聯動和交流，共同打擊跨境犯罪。

3. 兇殺案

兇殺案有194宗，當中包括被列作誤殺案的大埔宏福苑火災中的168名死者。警方就此火災至今拘捕16人，涉嫌誤殺。

餘下26宗案件中，16宗（佔61.5%）涉及家庭或親屬暴力，而2024年有10宗類似案件。所有案件中，只有一宗未被偵破，涉及在2025年六月遇害的49歲非華裔女子，警方正全力追緝已潛逃的疑兇歸案。

4. 傷人及嚴重毆打

傷人及嚴重毆打案共3 363宗，跌6.9%（-251宗）。當中8.3%與三合會有關。警方尤其關注涉及三合會及非華裔人士的案件（即因傷人及嚴重毆打案而被捕的非華裔人數），分別跌10.3%及9%。

5. 行劫

行劫案共66宗，跌26.7%（-24宗）。數字是自1969年有紀錄以來最低，平均每5.5日一宗，而破案率則高達90.9%。

期內沒有涉及真槍或電槍的劫案，一宗在銀行發生及兩宗涉及大額現金的劫案均在短時間內破案。透過閉路電視這重要的偵查工具，以及警務人員鍥而不捨的追查，警方迅速鎖定疑犯身分，並成功將他們拘捕。

情報工作亦是警隊有效打擊劫案的關鍵。2025年十一月，警方透過情報搜集，預先在紅磡區埋伏，拘捕八名企圖以牛肉刀搶劫38公斤金粉的疑犯。

6. 爆竊

爆竊案共816宗，跌33.1%（-404宗），同樣是自1969年以來歷史新低。

警方於2025年長假期爆竊案多發的日子，開始利用無人機隊展開反爆竊行動。復活節及暑假期間的爆竊案數字分別跌一半及30.2%。而在剛過去的聖誕節，警方繼續採取這類行動，爆竊案亦跌23.9%。未來警方會繼續在農曆新年等長假期使用無人機進行反爆竊行動。

7. 盜竊

盜竊案有20 032宗，跌10.7%（-2 401宗），大部分的類別錄得下跌，包括雜項盜竊（-9.7%）、店鋪盜竊（-9.6%），扒竊大跌56.3%；而搶掠（-23.4%）及車內盜竊（-17.2%）更分別是自1969年及1977年有紀錄以來最低。

失車案錄得上升，共涉及440輛車，上升51輛（+13.1%），一半案件（220輛）發生於面積大及有不少鄉郊及偏僻地區的新界北。私家車及電單車佔超過八成（81.6 %）。在440輛失車中，24.1%屬於「技術性失車」，即擅取家人、朋友或租車公司等的車輛；10.5%用作無牌駕駛；另外11.1%被用作犯案，主要為販毒。整體而言，60.2%的失車已被尋獲。

針對偷車上升，警方去年進行多個情報主導行動，共拘捕44人，起回28輛失車。警方亦自2025年七月起利用無人機在新界北的偷車黑點進行高空巡邏，加強阻嚇力。經過警方的連月打擊，失車數字的升幅已逐步收窄，由2025年上半年的53.5%升幅逐步收窄至全年13.1%升幅。

8. 勒索

勒索案有1 674宗，跌44.8%（-1 357宗），當中78.4%為「裸聊」（1 312宗），跌46.1%（-1 122宗）。

警方留意到學生佔受害人的比例由2024年的18.7%升至27.4%。就此，警方繼續加強宣傳教育工作，包括在2025年九月出版新一期《青少年罪行誌．師長攻略》，及於「守網者」網站推出「給家長的信」，內容涵蓋兒童網上性誘識及提防網上性勒索等議題。

9. 性罪行

強姦案有68宗 ，跌九宗（-11.7%），破案率達95.6%。期內有一宗涉及陌生人的案件，已被偵破。

非禮案有1 137宗，跌48宗（-4.1%），破案率達78.9%。

警方一直密切留意性罪行的情況，現時未見有特定趨勢。

10. 嚴重毒品罪行

嚴重毒品案有1 281宗，升15%（+167宗），涉及依托咪酯的案件佔29.4%（376宗）。

依托咪酯已成為整體及青少年最常吸食的毒品，其次為可卡因和大麻。自依托咪酯於2025年二月被列為毒品後，截至年底，警方錄得911宗涉及依托咪酯的案件，共拘捕1 134人，包括205名青少年。

截至2025年底，共有47宗依托咪酯案判刑，當中41宗為「管有危險藥物」案，最高判監六個月，餘下六宗為「販運危險藥物」案，最高判監24個月。警方會密切留意法庭判刑，並與律政司保持緊密溝通，研究要求法庭為依托咪酯作為新興毒品訂立合適的判刑指引。

警方自2025年八月起增設打擊依托咪酯的24小時舉報熱線（6629 2966）、WhatsApp及微信帳號，至年底接獲54宗舉報。政府亦已於2025/26學年將依托咪酯納入「健康校園計劃」，協助學校及早識別個案，以提供輔導及支援。

預防勝於治療，警方會繼續做好禁毒教育工作，2025年共舉辦32場講座、設置攤位，向近3萬名教師講解最新的禁毒資訊。2026年內，警方將到各區小學舉辦60場禁毒劇場。另外，「禁毒領袖學院」亦已經舉辦至第五屆，共67間中學報名，破歷屆紀錄。

11. 三合會相關罪行

三合會相關罪行有1 944宗，跌16.4%（-381宗）。

警方致力打擊三合會活動，開展執法及情報主導行動，重點打擊三合會的收入來源。警方2025年亦聯同廣東省和澳門，展開一年一度的「雷霆」行動，港方共拘捕4 140人，檢獲現金、毒品等，總值約5.5億元。

另外，警方經數年的調查搜集大量證據，於2025年七月進行收網行動，拘捕一個黑社會團伙共82人，當中包括該社團的頭目、家人及黨羽，並於行動中檢獲800多萬港元現金，凍結11.3億元黑錢。其後，警方於八月搗破該團伙的有組織跨境賣淫活動，拘捕67人，包括40多名來自多地的性工作者。警方的行動仍然繼續。

12. 青少年罪行

2025年，共2 662名青少年因刑事罪行而被捕，跌6.3%（-178人）。數字是自1990年有紀錄以來最低，可見警隊與各界在持續推展青少年防罪滅罪工作方面有一定成效。

13. 國家安全相關情況

自《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》生效後，截至2025年底，警方國安處共拘捕385人，超過一半已被檢控。

14. 總結

  2025年整體罪案數字有所下跌（-5.9%），絕大部分主要罪案錄得跌幅，當中行劫（-26.7%）及爆竊（-33.1%）更是有紀錄以來最低。

推行「銳眼」計劃後，多類在街道上發生的案件的破案率分別升2.5至22.8個百分點不等，罪案數字則跌3.1%至71.8%不等，可見「銳眼」計劃為防罪滅罪帶來十分正面的作用，香港整體治安情況更趨平穩。

​香港海關偵破兩宗大型海路走私案件並檢獲約六千八百萬元懷疑私煙（附圖）,2026-02-11 18:15,2026-02-11 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100659.htm,"香港海關近日展開執法行動打擊大型海路走私香煙活動，於一月三十一日及二月四日偵破兩宗案件，檢獲共約一千五百二十二萬支懷疑未完稅香煙，估計市值約六千八百萬元，應課稅值約五千萬元，並拘捕八名男子。

首宗案件中，海關於一月三十一日在南丫島西北水域截查一首可疑遠洋貨船。經搜查後，海關人員在船上四個空載貨櫃的暗格內檢獲約七百六十二萬支懷疑私煙，並拘捕八名年齡介乎二十一至五十九歲的懷疑涉案非本地男子，包括一名船長和七名船員。被捕船長已被落案控以「輸入未列艙單貨物」罪。

第二宗案件中，海關透過風險評估和情報分析，於二月四日在葵涌海關大樓驗貨場揀選及查驗一個由中國台灣抵港，報稱載有襪子的四十呎貨櫃。經檢查後，海關人員在貨櫃內檢獲約七百六十萬支懷疑私煙。

上述案件仍在調查中，海關會繼續追查私煙的來源和去向，不排除會有更多人被捕。

海關相信農曆新年臨近，私煙集團意圖囤積大量私煙以供應本地及海外市場。是次行動充份展示海關從源頭打擊私煙的執法成效。海關會繼續根據風險評估和情報分析從源頭堵截，並透過針對貯存及分銷販賣多管齊下的執法策略，致力打擊私煙活動。

海關強調，走私屬嚴重罪行。根據《進出口條例》，任何人輸入或輸出未列艙單貨物，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。此外，根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Hong Kong Customs detects two large-scale sea smuggling cases and seizes suspected illicit cigarettes worth about $68 million (with photos),2026-02-11 18:15,2026-02-11 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100660.htm,"Hong Kong Customs recently mounted enforcement operations to combat large-scale illicit cigarette smuggling activities by sea and detected two cases on January 31 and February 4, during which a total of about 15.22 million suspected illicit cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $68 million and a duty potential of about $50 million were seized. Eight men were arrested.

In the first case, Customs on January 31 intercepted a suspicious ocean-going cargo vessel in the northwestern waters off Lamma Island. Upon inspection, Customs officers seized about 7.62 million suspected illicit cigarettes concealed inside the false compartments built within four empty containers onboard the vessel. Eight non-local men, aged between 21 and 59, suspected to be connected with the case were arrested, comprising a captain and seven crew members. The arrested captain was charged with importing unmanifested cargoes.

In the second case, through risk assessment and intelligence analysis, Customs officers on February 4 selected for inspection a 40-foot container, declared as carrying socks and arriving from Taiwan, China, at the Kwai Chung Customhouse Cargo Examination Compound. Upon inspection, Customs officers seized about 7.6 million suspected illicit cigarettes inside the container.

Investigations of the cases are ongoing. Customs will continue to trace the source and flow of the illicit cigarettes. The likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

Customs believes that, with the imminent arrival of the Lunar New Year, cigarette smuggling syndicates attempted to stockpile large quantities of illicit cigarettes to supply both local and overseas markets. The operation results demonstrate the effectiveness of Customs' enforcement strategy in combating cigarette smuggling at source. Customs will continue its risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as through its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storage, distribution and peddling to spare no effort in combating illicit cigarette activities.

Customs stresses that smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years. In addition, under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

In the 2025 Policy Address, the Chief Executive emphasised that the Government would sustain its efforts in promoting youth development on all fronts. This includes continuing to implement various exchange and internship programmes on the Mainland and overseas to help young people broaden international horizons and cultivate a holistic outlook. In this regard, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau forged partnerships with large corporates to launch the HYAB Scheme on Corporate Summer Internship on the Mainland and Overseas for Hong Kong youth to intern at the Mainland and overseas operations of these corporates. The Scheme will help young people learn and experience first-hand the national development and international trends, and at the same time provide them with exposure to the work culture in large corporates and the opportunity to establish interpersonal networks outside Hong Kong, enabling them to accumulate invaluable work experience and lay a foundation for future career development.

The number of companies participating in the new round of the Scheme has increased to 29. Internship placements are offered in multiple Chinese Mainland provinces and cities, including various Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Chongqing and Hangzhou, as well as overseas countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Australia. The internship placements also cover a wider range of industries than before, such as financial services, innovation and technology, pharmaceutical, logistics, property development, construction, retail, hospitality and utilities (please refer to Annex for details of the internship placements). Applicants must be aged 18 or above and should be (i) a full time post-secondary student (including sub-degree, undergraduate, or postgraduate) holding a Hong Kong permanent identity card; or (ii) a local full-time post-secondary student (including sub-degree, undergraduate, or postgraduate) holding a Hong Kong identity card. The internship will take place between June and September this year. Participating companies will sponsor the interns for major expenses including transportation and accommodation costs, and assign dedicated personnel to provide training and support to the interns.

Details of the Scheme are available on the dedicated webpage (www.ydc.gov.hk/scsi/en). Interested young people should submit their applications through the centralised application platform on the dedicated webpage on or before March 9. Each person can apply for up to three companies in one application. Upon receiving the applications, participating companies will contact suitable applicants directly for the assessment and selection process, and make placement arrangements for selected interns."

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-11 17:30,2026-02-11 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100635.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 11), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2026-02-11 17:22,2026-02-11 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100682.htm,"An incoming passenger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (February 11) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted an incoming male passenger, aged 33, at Hong Kong International Airport on February 9 and seized about 22 800 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $91,000 and a duty potential of about $75,000, from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence imposes a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

海關人員於二月九日在香港國際機場截查一名三十三歲抵港男旅客，並在他的行李內共檢獲約二萬二千八百支未完稅香煙，市值共約九萬一千元，應課稅值共約七萬五千元。該名抵港旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《應課稅品條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

衞生防護中心提醒市民現時不要進食生蠔及未經煮熟的雙殼類海產　避免感染諾如病毒,2026-02-11 17:20,2026-02-11 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100675.htm,"鑑於近期與進食生蠔相關的諾如病毒食物中毒個案大幅上升，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（二月十一日）再次呼籲市民提高警覺，時刻保持個人、食物及環境衞生，現時不應進食生蠔及未經煮熟的雙殼類海產，特別是長者、孕婦和小童及免疫力弱的人士，因他們感染諾如病毒後有較大機會出現併發症（例如脫水）。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「過去數周錄得的食物中毒個案持續增加，由去年十二月底每周錄得平均一宗個案，上升至一月每周平均四宗。一月十八日至二月十日，中心已錄得39宗食物中毒個案，共影響44男和75女，年齡介於15至75歲。其中，近九成（35宗）與諾如病毒相關，涉及105人。流行病學調查發現上述與諾如病毒相關的食物中毒個案的受影響人士全部在潛伏期內曾食用生蠔。受影響人士當中，有六人須留院治理，全部情況穩定。中心已將全部食物中毒個案通知食物環境衞生署食物安全中心作適當跟進及追查來源，調查仍在進行。」

徐樂堅醫生解釋：「由於蠔隻以過濾大量海水的方式進食，如果養蠔或採蠔的水域水質帶有病原體，這些物質便會在蠔的體內積聚。生或未徹底煮熟的蠔是高風險食物，進食受污染及未經煮熟的蠔，可能感染經由食物傳染的疾病，例如諾如病毒、甲型肝炎病毒或其他細菌。農曆新年期間，市民很多時會與親友聚餐，我特別提醒市民，無論是在家或光顧食肆，應進食徹底煮熟食物，特別是貝類，以避免感染腸道疾病。酒精飲料、檸檬汁或芥末亦不能殺死諾如病毒。以火鍋或炭燒方式進食蠔，亦要確保完全熟透，方可有效降低感染諾如病毒的風險。鑑於近期諾如病毒的活躍程度上升，流行病學數據亦顯示大部分食物中毒是由進食生蠔引致的，而食物環境衞生署食物安全中心正在調查生蠔來源，因此建議市民不應冒險進食未經煮熟的蠔。」

​徐樂堅醫生續說：「值得留意的是，諾如病毒具高度傳染性，因進食受污染食物而感染諾如病毒的人士，可能會透過人與人接觸或受嘔吐物污染的環境，將病毒傳播給其他人。除了食物中毒，諾如病毒亦是引致急性腸胃炎的主要原因之一。我們的監測指標顯示本地急性腸胃炎的活躍程度自一月初起持續上升，最新數據顯示，今年（截至二月十日）暫時已錄得38宗院舍和學校的急性腸胃炎爆發個案，涉及294人。實驗室的檢測顯示超過七成半是諾如病毒引致。此外，其他香港人的旅遊熱點，包括日本及韓國，近日的諾如病毒活躍程度亦持續上升，韓國的監測數據顯示諾如病毒活躍程度達近五年同期的新高。市民外遊時要提高警覺，注意個人、環境及食物衞生，以減低受感染的風險。」

要預防急性腸胃炎及諾如病毒感染，必須經常保持雙手清潔。由於酒精未能有效殺死諾如病毒，酒精搓手液不能代替使用梘液和清水潔手，尤其在處理食物或進食前及如廁後。洗手時應以梘液和清水清潔雙手，搓手最少20秒，用水過清並用抹手紙或乾手機弄乾。

二月份第二批涵蓋21個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及一個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，大部份地區均錄得0%，顯示白紋伊蚊的分布情況並不廣泛。

食環署至今已公布二○二六年二月共兩批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共48個監察地區。與上月（即二○二六年一月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這48監察地區中，47個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；只有一區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自二○二五年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區62個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。在監察期間，食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"
Hong Kong Customs alerts public to one model of unsafe toy truck (with photo),2026-02-11 17:00,2026-02-11 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100558.htm,"Hong Kong Customs today (February 11) informed members of the public to stay alert to a model of an unsafe toy truck. Test results indicated that the amount ofClass 2 phthalates contained in the model exceeded the limit stipulated in the Toys and Children's Products Safety Ordinance (TCPSO) and its subsidiary legislation. To avoid an accident, parents should immediately stop their children from playing with the toy. Traders should also remove the toy from their shelves.

Customs officers earlier conducted a test-buy operation on nine models of toy vehicles from retailers in different districts for safety testing. Results from the Government Laboratory revealed that Class 2 phthalates contained in a model of a toy truck reached 2.43 per cent of the total weight of its plasticised materials, exceeding the limit of 0.1 per cent stipulated in the TCPSO and its subsidiary legislation.

Customs later conducted a search operation against three shops of the retailer and seized eight toy trucks of the same model from a branch. Moreover, spot checks were conducted in various districts across the territory. No further toy trucks connected to the case have been found for sale so far. An investigation is ongoing.

Customs reminds members of the public that chronic exposure to plasticiser may harm children's health and cause liver, kidney, reproductive and development system toxicity. When purchasing and using toys, parents should observe the following safety tips:


Do not let children play with toys alone;
Avoid prolonged exposure to,or licking of plastic toys;
Follow the instructions associated with the toys;
Check the structure of the toys to see, for example, whether they have a fragile structure, hidden sharp points, rough surfaces, sharp edges or gaps that may pinch children's fingers; and
Stop children from playing with the toys immediately if any damage is observed.


Customs is committed to the protection of consumer interests and regularly conducts spot checks and safety tests on toys and children's products to ensure that they are reasonably safe for use by consumers.

Under the TCPSO, it is an offence to supply, manufacture or import unsafe toys or children's products. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for one year on first conviction, and a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for two years on subsequent conviction.

Members of the public may report information relating to suspected unsafe toys or children's products via Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Among the second batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 21 survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering one survey area in February, most of the areas recorded 0 per cent, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive.

The FEHD has so far released two batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in February 2026, covering 48 survey areas. Among these 48 survey areas, 47 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. January 2026, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Only one area recorded a slight increase, but the index was lower than 10 per cent.

​The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August 2025, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever (DF). At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 62 survey areas of the community, with a surveillance period of two weeks. During the surveillance period, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#).

"GCMTI specialist awarded title of ""Qi Huang Young Scholar"" - sharing Hong Kong's expertise to serve nation (with photo)",2026-02-11 16:20,2026-02-11 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100553.htm,"​The Department of Health (DH) today (February 11) announced that Dr Queenie Wong, a Plant Taxonomist at the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute (GCMTI) of the DH, has been awarded the prestigious title of ""Qi Huang Young Scholar"" by the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (NATCM) following a rigorous selection process. She is the first DH officer to receive this national honour.

The NATCM selects around 100 Chinese medicine practitioners, scholars and researchers across the country every three years. Candidates must be under 45 years old, demonstrate high professional standards, and show capabilities in preserving tradition and driving innovation in Chinese medicine. It nurtures and supports these scholars in conducting pioneering research in Chinese medicine. This year, two scholars from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) were honoured with the title: Dr Wong and Professor Lisa Xian, Assistant Professor of the School of Chinese Medicine, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, extended his heartfelt congratulations to both recipients.

Dr Wong has served in the DH for nine years. Dr Lam said, ""Dr Wong has devoted herself to the micro-morphological identification of Chinese medicines (CM), combining the strengths of traditional macroscopic techniques with modern microscopic identification methods. Her work has enabled the GCMTI to establish an innovative, practical, and accurate identification system that helps the industry authenticate genuine CM and promotes their safe use. Her selection as a 'Qi Huang Young Scholar' from numerous applicants nationwide not only affirms her outstanding research achievements but also underscores the HKSAR's potential to become an international centre for CM testing and quality control. The GCMTI, which commenced services in phases late last year, is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities that will undoubtedly provide greater support for Dr Wong's research endeavours in the future. Leveraging Hong Kong's strengths, she will contribute to serving the country's needs and, together with the GCMTI's scientific team, advance the development of Chinese medicine for the health and well-being of all.""

Expressing her gratitude, Dr Wong said she is deeply honoured to be nominated by the DH and selected nationally as a ""Qi Huang Young Scholar"". She acknowledges the huge responsibilities that come with the title and looks forward to collaborating with fellow scholars to conduct innovative research under the NATCM's guidance, contributing to the inheritance and advancements of Chinese medicine in the country. She also aspires to further elevate the research capacity in Chinese medicine in Hong Kong and promote co-operation between the HKSAR and the Chinese Mainland.

Since its establishment, the GCMTI has aligned closely with the national strategy for developing Chinese medicine, adopting a three-pronged approach of ""technologies, standards and talents"" to drive high-quality development in Chinese medicine. Dr Wong firmly believes that the GCMTI will continue to inject new momentum into the sector, serving as a vital support for Chinese medicine's global advancement and better integrating into the country's overall development.

The GCMTI brings together experts from multiple disciplines and has long been committed to establishing internationally recognised reference standards and testing methods for CM. By promoting technology transfer, it has enhanced the quality control and identification capabilities of the CM industry and testing sector. The GCMTI has gained widespread recognition in the industry and internationally, particularly for establishing Hong Kong's leading position in the field of micro-morphological identification of CM.

Micro-morphological identification involves using instruments or high-power magnifying glasses to observe minute surface features of CM that are difficult or impossible to discern with the naked eye (see Annex). These features serve as identification criteria, supplementing traditional macroscopic identification methods. For CM with similar morphology, micro-morphology provides additional distinguishing features to differentiate visually similar species. To promote the use of this simple, easy and cost-effective micro-morphological identification, the GCMTI has conducted specific research in this area and developed practical identification methods tailored for real-world applications to address challenges commonly encountered by the industry.

With the phased commissioning of its permanent building since late last year, the GCMTI's advanced technology and equipment will further enhance the development of CM's testing methods and standards, supporting the comprehensive, high-quality development of Chinese medicine in Hong Kong."

CEDB and MOC sign MOU on strengthening co-operation and exchange in provision of comprehensive overseas services (with photos),2026-02-11 16:00,2026-02-11 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100334.htm,"  The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, and Member of the Communist Party of China Leadership Group of the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) and Assistant Minister Mr Zhang Li met in Beijing today (February 11) to exchange views on supporting Mainland enterprises to go global. They also witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on strengthening co-operation and exchange in the provision of comprehensive overseas services.

 With the signing of the MOU, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government and the MOC will strengthen co-operation and exchange in the provision of comprehensive overseas services by leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages of enjoying the strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, thereby fostering closer collaboration between Mainland enterprises seeking to go global and Hong Kong professional service providers, and strengthening the capacity of Mainland enterprises in going global. The MOU also supports the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) to develop a professional services platform, pooling together Hong Kong professional service providers in the field of finance, legal and dispute resolution, accounting and audit, testing and certification, etc, to support Mainland enterprises seeking to go global.

 Mr Yau thanked the MOC for its continuous support in the investment promotion work of the HKSAR Government. Leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages amid the opening up of the country, the HKSAR Government will support Mainland enterprises to go global, further foster investment and trade relations between Hong Kong and the Mainland, and strive to reinforce and enhance Hong Kong's status as an international trade centre.

 Mr Yau said, ""The country is implementing a high-level strategy of two-way opening up to encourage Mainland enterprises to go global. The MOC is spearheading the implementation of the related work in the provision of comprehensive overseas services. As a 'super connector' and a 'super value-adder', Hong Kong can help Mainland enterprises expand businesses abroad and overcome challenges encountered in the process. The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau has set up the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global (GoGlobal Task Force) to co-ordinate cross-bureau, cross-departmental and cross-organisation work to provide one-stop go global support. The GoGlobal Task Force will make use of various channels to promote to target Mainland enterprises the advantages of using Hong Kong as a springboard to go global. It will also provide tailored services according to the needs of the enterprises to support their overseas expansion through Hong Kong.""

 Mr Yau added, ""The HKTDC is currently developing a cross-sectoral platform, which assembles Hong Kong professional service providers from different fields to match them with different Mainland enterprises based on their needs, thereby supporting the enterprises to establish a foothold in Hong Kong and then expand their businesses overseas. The platform will also bring more business opportunities to the Hong Kong professional service providers and increase the influence of Hong Kong professional services locally and internationally. The GoGlobal Task Force will co-ordinate the organisation of different promotional events on the Mainland and Hong Kong, and will identify and attract enterprises to go global via Hong Kong.""

 In his 2025 Policy Address, the Chief Executive announced the establishment of a one-stop platform by mobilising Hong Kong's overseas offices, including those under Invest Hong Kong and the HKTDC, as well as Hong Kong offices on the Mainland, and has set up the cross-bureau, cross-departmental and cross-sectoral GoGlobal Task Force to proactively attract Mainland enterprises to go global via Hong Kong. Since its inception last October, the GoGlobal Task Force has worked closely with relevant Mainland authorities and progressively formulated and implemented relevant work.

 Mr Yau concluded his visit this afternoon and willreturn to Hong Kong this evening."

透過簽署備忘錄，香港特別行政區（特區）政府和商務部將加強海外綜合服務領域交流合作，發揮香港在「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，促進內地出海企業與香港專業服務機構加強合作，提升服務內地企業出海的能力。備忘錄亦支持香港貿易發展局（貿發局）建立專業服務平台，匯聚金融、法律及爭議解決、會計審計、檢驗認證等香港專業服務機構，為內地出海企業提供服務。

丘應樺感謝商務部一直支持特區政府招商引資的工作，特區政府會發揮好香港在國家對外開放大局中的獨特優勢，支持內地企業出海，進一步促進內地與香港投資和貿易關係，並致力鞏固提升香港作為國際貿易中心的地位。

丘應樺說：「國家正實施高水平雙向對外開放戰略，鼓勵內地企業出海發展。商務部正在牽頭實施海外綜合服務體系建設有關工作。香港作為內聯外通的『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』可以幫助內地企業拓展海外業務，應對在出海過程中可能會遇到的各種挑戰。商經局已成立內地企業出海專班，統籌和協調政策局、部門及相關機構提供一站式出海支援。出海專班會利用多元渠道向目標內地企業宣傳以香港為出海平台的優勢，並按不同企業的需要量身訂製全方位支援服務，以助力內地企業透過香港出海。」

他續指：「貿發局正建立一個跨界別服務平台，匯聚香港不同界別的專業服務提供者，按內地企業的需要進行合適配對，協助它們落戶香港，繼而拓展海外業務。平台亦同時為香港的專業服務提供者帶來更多商機，進一步提升香港專業服務在海內外的影響力。接下來，出海專班會統籌在內地和香港舉辦不同的推廣活動、物色並吸引有意經香港出海的企業。」

行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》提出整合投資推廣署、貿發局和香港駐內地的辦事處的相關職能及組成一站式平台，並成立跨局、跨部門、跨界別的出海專班，主動招攬內地企業利用香港平台出海。自去年十月成立以來，出海專班與內地相關部委保持緊密聯繫，積極敲定並逐步推進有關工作。

丘應樺今日下午結束行程，晚上將返抵香港。"

政府中藥檢測中心專家獲國家授予「青年岐黃學者」稱號　以香港專長貢獻國家（附圖）,2026-02-11 15:00,2026-02-11 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100483.htm,"衞生署今日（二月十一日）公布，衞生署轄下政府中藥檢測中心（檢測中心）植物分類學家黃麗麗博士，經國家中醫藥管理局（管理局）嚴格選拔，獲國家授予「青年岐黃學者」稱號，成為首位獲此殊榮的衞生署人員。

管理局每三年在全國遴選約100位45歲以下、具高中醫藥專業水平和傳承創新能力的中醫師、學者和研究人員，重點培養和支持他們進行有關中醫藥的前沿創新研究。今年香港特別行政區（特區）共有兩人獲國家授予「青年岐黃學者」稱號，另一名獲此殊榮的是香港中文大學中醫學院助理教授冼彥芳。衞生署署長林文健醫生衷心恭賀黃麗麗博士及冼彥芳教授。

黃麗麗博士加入衞生署已九年，林文健醫生說：「黃麗麗博士長期致力於微性狀鑒定中藥，結合傳統性狀鑒定與現代顯微技術的優點，協助檢測中心制定一套創新、簡便而準確的鑒定方法，讓業界更容易鑒定中藥正品，同時有助推動中藥安全使用。她從全國眾多申請人中脫穎而出成為新一屆『青年岐黃學者』一員，除了充分肯定她的卓越研究成就，亦彰顯香港特區具備成為中藥檢測和質量控制國際中心的能力。去年底分階段投入服務的檢測中心配備尖端設施，日後定能為她的研究工作提供更大助力，以香港所長貢獻國家所需。黃博士將與檢測中心的科學團隊共同為推動國家中醫藥發展、為人類健康福祉貢獻智慧和源源力量。」

黃麗麗博士對獲衞生署推薦參與全國選拔，並獲選「青年岐黃學者」深感榮幸，亦深知任重道遠。她希望可以與其他頂尖的「青年岐黃學者」在管理局的指導下，開展更多創新研究，助力國家中醫藥的傳承和突破，同時進一步提升本港中醫藥的科研水平，促進香港特區和中國內地的合作。

檢測中心成立以來，一直緊隨國家中醫藥發展戰略，奉行「技術、標準、人才」三輪驅動，助力中醫藥高品質發展。黃麗麗博士深信她服務的檢測中心定能為中醫藥高品質發展不斷注入新動力，成為中醫藥走向世界的重要支撐點，更好融入和服務國家發展大局。

檢測中心匯聚多個學科的精英，多年來致力為中藥建立國際認可的參考標準與檢測方法，並透過推動技術轉移，提升中藥業界與檢測業界在品質控制與鑒定的能力，深受業界及國際認可，特別在中藥微性狀鑒定領域，為香港建立了領先地位。

微性狀鑒定是應用儀器或高倍放大鏡（見附件），觀察中藥表面肉眼不易察覺或未能看清的細微性狀特徵，並以此作為鑒定依據，是傳統性狀鑒定的延伸。對於性狀特徵較為相近的中藥，微性狀可以提供更多特徵以助區別外形相似的品種。由於微性狀鑒定簡便易行而又經濟實用，因此檢測中心特別開展有關方面的研究，針對業界日常所遇到的困難，建立切合實際應用的鑒定方法。

隨着檢測中心永久大樓自去年底分階段投入服務，其高端科技和器材將進一步提升中藥檢測方法及中藥標準開發能力，助力香港中醫藥全方位高質量發展。"
Secretary for Health visits Shenzhen (with photos),2026-02-11 14:58,2026-02-11 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100422.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, visited Shenzhen today (February 11) to meet with health officials from the Guangdong Provincial and Shenzhen Municipal Governments, as well as port control officials. The visit aims to further deepen cross-boundary healthcare collaboration with the Mainland, particularly with Mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area (GBA).

  Professor Lo first met with Deputy Director of the Public Hygiene and Health Commission of Shenzhen Municipality (SZHC) Mr Li Chuang and Second-level Inspector of the Office of Port of Entry and Exit of the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government (Shenzhen Port Office) Mr Wu Bing as well as representatives from the Shenzhen Customs and the Shenzhen General Station of Immigration Inspection. A representative from the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office of the Department of Health (DH) introduced the tobacco control direction and policies of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government at the meeting.

  Professor Lo expressed gratitude to the Shenzhen Municipal Government for their long-time support in fostering cross-boundary healthcare measures. He said, ""I would like to give special thanks to the SZHC, the Shenzhen Port Office, the Shenzhen Customs and the Shenzhen General Station of Immigration Inspection for their support on the HKSAR Government's work on tobacco control, including enhancing the promotion of Hong Kong's latest tobacco control regulations to visitors travelling to Hong Kong in the boundary control point area in Shenzhen, and working together in advocating the concept of the 'Smoke-free Port, Fresh Bay Area'. I look forward to deepening co-operation and exchanges between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, thereby reducing the harm caused by tobacco together and safeguarding public health.""

  Professor Lo then visited the University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen Hospital (HKU-SZH) with Deputy Director-General of the Health Commission of Guangdong Province (GDHC) Mr Deng Linfeng to inspect the practical implementation of cross-boundary healthcare measures and visit the hospital's phase II development.

  Professor Lo said, ""Since July 2024, the Health Bureau has piloted the 'Cross-boundary Health Record' and the 'Personal Folder' functions on the eHealth mobile application at HKU-SZH, which support Hong Kong citizens to securely use their electronic health records outside Hong Kong under the principle of 'bring your own health records'. The two functions have been extended to 19 medical institutions under the 'Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme' since September 2024. Starting January this year, we have made a significant breakthrough through the 'Personal Folder' function. Citizens can authorise three medical institutions in the GBA to directly deposit radiology reports and images, which are often challenging to upload themselves, into their personal eHealth accounts. This upgrade allows citizens to store and utilise electronic health records from healthcare services received outside Hong Kong in a more convenient and secure manner, thereby facilitating greater continuity of care. We look forward to continuing our partnership with the GDHC to further advance cross-boundary health record sharing, with a view to supporting the cross-boundary medical needs of citizens more effectively and improving the quality and safety of cross-boundary healthcare services.""

  During the inspection at HKU-SZH, Professor Lo also interacted with Hong Kong seniors receiving treatment. He was pleased to learn that they found the usage arrangements for the Elderly Health Care Voucher convenient, with the medical process and services being meticulous and smooth. They commended the HKSAR Government for expanding the voucher's applicability to 21 service points within the Mainland cities of the GBA, providing them with more healthcare options and saving them the trouble of long journeys, thereby enhancing their sense of well-being.

  Members of the delegation include the Permanent Secretary for Health, Mr Thomas Chan, and representatives from the DH and the Hospital Authority."

Office of Licensing Authority of Home Affairs Department steps up enforcement actions against unlicensed and licensed hotels/guesthouses before Chinese New Year holidays (with photo),2026-02-11 14:45,2026-02-11 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100416.htm,"Before the Chinese New Year holidays, the Office of the Licensing Authority (OLA) of the Home Affairs Department conducted an operation codenamed ""Solar Flare"" against suspected unlicensed hotels or guesthouses at Yau Tsim Mong District in early February to ensure the safety of the customers as well as the general public. The OLA also conducted the operation with the Immigration Department and the Labour Department to jointly inspect licensed hotels or guesthouses.

A spokesman for the OLA said, ""Based on intelligence gathered, the OLA carried out surprise inspections on 12 premises throughout the whole operation. Six premises were suspected of operating unlicensed hotels or guesthouses, while three licensed guesthouses were suspected of breaching certain licensing conditions. The OLA will initiate prosecution on cases with sufficient evidence after completion of the investigation.""

The spokesman stressed, ""Operating unlicensed hotels or guesthouses is a criminal offence leading to a criminal record upon conviction. According to the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance, an offender is liable to three years' imprisonment and a maximum fine of $500,000. A fine of $20,000 for each day can also be imposed during which the offence continues. Moreover, a licensed hotel or guesthouse which contravenes any licensing conditions (e.g. carrying out alteration and addition works without seeking prior approval) is liable to two years' imprisonment and a maximum fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment. A fine of $10,000 for each day can also be imposed during which the offence continues.""

To enhance deterrence against unlicensed hotels and guesthouses, the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance was amended in 2020 to empower the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Authority to apply to the court, upon the second conviction within 16 months of operating an unlicensed hotel or guesthouse or the new strict liability offence in respect of the same premises, to issue a closure order to close the premises for six months. As at January 31, the OLA has applied for five closure orders under the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance from the court, of which three closure orders have been issued by the court. 

Apart from conducting special operations during festive seasons, the OLA also steps up efforts to combat unlicensed guesthouses via online platforms. The OLA has strengthened its intelligence collection by forming a dedicated team to browse webpages, mobile applications, social media, discussion forums, etc, to search for information and intelligence on suspected unlicensed guesthouses. The OLA's law enforcement officers will initiate follow-up investigations when information on unlicensed guesthousesadvertised via online platforms is found. The OLA also conducts publicity work on Internet search engines outside Hong Kong toenable tourists' access to the information provided by the OLA in the course of planning their trips to Hong Kong.

Tourists and members of the public can make use of the search functions on the OLA's website (www.hadla.gov.hk) to check whether the hotel or guesthouse concerned is licensed or not. Any suspected unlicensed hotel or guesthouse should be reported to the OLA by the hotline (Tel: 2881 7498), by email (hadlaenq@had.gov.hk), by fax (2504 5805), or through the mobile application ""Hong Kong Licensed Hotels and Guesthouses""."

  Over 300 guests from various sectors including political and business circles, media, academic and community groups as well as government representatives attended the reception. Among them were the Consul-General of the People's Republic of China in Sydney, Mr Wang Yu; the Minister for Better Regulation and Fair Trading, the Minister for Industry and Trade, the Minister for Innovation, Science and Technology, the Minister for Building and Minister for Corrections of New South Wales (NSW), Mr Anoulack Chanthivong, representing the Premier of NSW; and Councillor of the City of Sydney Mr Robert Kok, representing the Lord Mayor of the City of Sydney.
  
  The Director of the Sydney ETO, Mr Ricky Chong, said in his welcoming remarks that Hong Kong and Australia have long shared a dynamic and multifaceted partnership, underpinned by close co-operation in trade, investment, education, cultural exchanges and people-to-people ties. He noted that Hong Kong was Australia's 15th-largest trading partner and ninth-largest export market last year, with bilateral trade in goods reaching AU$8 billion, while around 200 Australian companies operate in Hong Kong, many using the city as regional headquarters or regional offices.

  Mr Chong highlighted the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government's ongoing efforts to strengthen international economic engagement through the establishment of the Economic and Trade Express, which brings together the collective strengths of overseas Economic and Trade Offices, Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. The initiative supports Hong Kong enterprises in exploring overseas opportunities and assists Mainland companies in going global, reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"".

  He also introduced the Northern Metropolis, Hong Kong's most ambitious city-building project, which will become a new engine for innovation, technology, education and advanced industries, creating fresh opportunities for businesses, talent and investors from around the world, including Australia.

  Mr Chong also highlighted the launch of the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand, positioning Hong Kong as an international post-secondary education hub. With five universities ranked among the world's top 100 and a strong emphasis on research and innovation, Hong Kong offers a truly international learning environment for global talent.

  ""As we welcome the Year of the Horse, we look forward to deepening our partnership with NSW and the rest of Australia, expanding collaboration, strengthening economic ties, and fostering even closer connections between our peoples,"" Mr Chong said.

  The Sydney ETO will also host Chinese New Year receptions in Melbourne (February 12), Brisbane (February 27), Adelaide (March 3) and Perth (March 5) in Australia, and Auckland (February 24) in New Zealand, to celebrate the Year of the Horse with local communities."
醫務衞生局局長到深圳調研（附圖）,2026-02-11 13:55,2026-02-11 14:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100391.htm,"醫務衞生局（醫衞局）局長盧寵茂教授今日（二月十一日）到訪深圳，與廣東省和深圳市政府的衞生和口岸辦官員會面，持續深化與內地，特別是大灣區內地城市在醫療衞生方面的跨境協作。

盧寵茂教授首先與深圳市衞生健康委員會（衞健委）副主任李創、深圳市人民政府口岸辦公室（深圳口岸辦）二級巡視員吳兵，以及深圳海關和深圳出入境邊防檢查總站（深圳邊檢總站）代表進行會談，衞生署控煙酒辦公室代表亦在會上簡介香港特別行政區（特區）政府的控煙方向及政策。

盧寵茂教授感謝深圳市政府就促進各項跨境醫療措施一直以來的支持。他說﹕「我特別感謝深圳市衞健委、深圳口岸辦、深圳海關和深圳邊檢總站對特區政府控煙工作的支持，包括加強在深圳的口岸範圍向來港旅客宣傳香港的最新控煙規定，攜手推廣『無煙口岸，清新灣區』的概念。我期望深港兩地繼續深化合作與交流，共同降低煙害，守護公眾健康。」

盧寵茂教授其後與廣東省衞健委副主任鄧林峰到香港大學深圳醫院（港大深圳醫院）調研跨境醫療措施的實際使用情況，並參觀港大深圳醫院二期建設。

盧寵茂教授表示︰「醫衞局自二○二四年七月起以港大深圳醫院作試點推行醫健通流動應用程式的『跨境健康紀錄』及『個人資料夾』功能，在自攜病歷的原則下，便利香港市民安全地跨境使用電子健康紀錄。兩項功能自二○二四年九月起擴展至『長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃』下的19間醫療機構。由今年一月起，我們實現進一步突破，讓市民可透過『個人資料夾』功能授權三間大灣區醫院直接存入一些較難自行上傳的放射檢查報告及影像至個人醫健通戶口，從而更便捷和安全地保存和運用境外就醫時的電子健康紀錄，以獲得更連貫的護理服務。我們期望與廣東省衞健委繼續合力推展跨境醫療紀錄互通，務求更有效地支援市民的跨境醫療需求，提升跨境醫護服務的質量安全。」

在港大深圳醫院視察期間，盧寵茂教授亦與到診的香港長者交流，欣悉他們認為長者醫療券（醫療券）的使用安排便利，就醫流程和服務細緻及暢順，並讚揚特區政府擴展醫療券的適用範圍至大灣區內地城市21個服務點，讓他們有更多就醫選擇並可省卻舟車勞動，為他們帶來幸福感。

代表團成員包括醫衞局常任秘書長陳松青、衞生署代表和醫院管理局代表。"
