基孔肯雅熱全球肆虐　衞生署加強防控教育（附圖）,2025-07-25 18:50,2025-07-25 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500746.htm,"基孔肯雅熱在全球多個國家和地區肆虐，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月二十五日）表示，會繼續多管齊下，預防基孔肯雅熱傳入並在本港傳播，保障市民健康。中心下星期會舉行兩場網上講座，由醫生講解基孔肯雅熱的病徵、如何預防受感染、如何正確使用昆蟲驅避劑等，以期加深市民對這種蚊傳疾病的認識，一同參與防控工作，護己護人。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「基孔肯雅熱主要透過帶有基孔肯雅熱病毒的雌性伊蚊叮咬而傳染給人類，並不會人傳人。基孔肯雅熱近期在全球多個地區錄得的案例急升，來勢洶洶，香港出現輸入個案的風險相當高。『預防勝治療』絕對適合套用於應對基孔肯雅熱。本港現時雖然沒有獲註冊的預防基孔肯雅熱疫苗，但避免蚊叮及蚊子滋生可築起有效的預防屏障，避免該病在本港傳播。就此，中心已加強對不同群組的宣傳教育，亦會繼續與不同政府部門及持份者通力合作，嚴陣以待。」

徐樂堅醫生補充，基孔肯雅熱在蚊患嚴重的環境很容易出現大規模爆發，對醫療系統構成負擔。雖然基孔肯雅熱患者病情大多輕微，但長者、幼童和長期病患者感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症。痊癒後亦有機會出現長期關節痛，情況可以持續數月以至數年，對患者生活帶來不便甚至困擾，所以不應掉以輕心。

口岸的防控工作

中心港口衞生科已在各個口岸加強有關基孔肯雅熱的宣傳教育工作；加強巡查四周確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施；為抵港人士進行體溫篩查，為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，並在有需要時轉介他們到醫院作出跟進。中心亦會與航空公司和旅遊業界等持份者保持緊密聯繫，適時更新疾病資訊和健康建議。

提醒醫護人員呈報

中心今日再次就基孔肯雅熱去信全港醫生和醫院，以提供最新流行病學資訊，並呼籲他們留意外遊回港的求診人士是否有基孔肯雅熱相關病徵。如發現病例，應即時轉介病人入院治理，並按既定機制向衞生署呈報，以展開流行病學調查及防控工作。

市民應繼續採取的措施

中心下星期會舉行兩場網上講座，喚起公眾對基孔肯雅熱的關注和回應市民的相關查詢，詳情稍後會於中心的社交媒體帳號公布，歡迎市民收看。中心亦已在全港多個不同地點（包括公共街市、地區康健中心及商場）設置流動宣傳攤位，教育公眾如何預防蚊子傳播的疾病，詳情可瀏覽www.chp.gov.hk/tc/other/events/476.html 。

中心建議市民使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


基孔肯雅熱在全球的最新情況

本港由二○二○年至今，沒有錄得確診基孔肯雅熱的個案。

世界衞生組織的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱個案。截至今年六月初，全球14個國家／地區共錄得超過22萬宗個案（包括內地、台灣、新加坡等香港人的旅遊熱點），當中約80宗為死亡個案。近期留尼汪島約三分之一的人口估計感染了基孔肯雅熱，而歐洲（包括法國及意大利）亦出現個案。

廣東佛山市順德區今年七月出現基孔肯雅熱爆發情況，由外地輸入個案引起，截至七月二十四日，佛山市錄得3 645宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，絕大部分（3 317宗）出現在順德區；另外禪城區有178宗、南海區有141宗、三水區有六宗及高明區有三宗。所有患者症狀輕微，暫時沒有錄得嚴重或死亡個案。澳門方面，當局於七月十八日及七月二十二日錄得當地今年首宗及第二宗基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，患者於潛伏期分別到過順德區和南海區。

徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然香港目前未有發現主要傳播基孔肯雅熱的埃及伊蚊，但白紋伊蚊亦可以傳播基孔肯雅熱。基孔肯雅熱及登革熱的輸入個案如在傳染期被蚊子叮咬，有機會導致本地傳播。炎熱多雨的春夏月份有利蚊子迅速繁殖，如控蚊成效不足，便有爆發蚊傳疾病的風險。因此，控蚊工作至關重要。不論在本地或外遊時，應時刻保持環境衞生、注意防蚊控蚊及採取個人保護措施。大家應緊記防止蚊子滋生及避免被蚊叮是預防蚊傳疾病的最佳方法。科學研究顯示，即使沒有病徵或尚未出現病徵的感染者被蚊叮咬，亦有機會把病毒傳給蚊子。市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節。」

登革熱最新情況,2025-07-25 18:30,2025-07-25 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500750.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月二十五日）公布登革熱個案的最新數字。中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，夏季伴隨著高溫及多雨，本港蚊患情況預料會加劇，加上市民在暑假會較頻繁前往登革熱流行地區，因此本地登革熱的風險正在上升。

由七月十八日至昨日（七月二十四日），中心錄得三宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期內曾到印度尼西亞、斯里蘭卡及泰國。

截至昨日，今年錄得33宗外地傳入登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。二○二三年則錄得62宗外地傳入個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。在二○二三年，全球80多個國家及地區共呈報了逾650萬宗病例和7 300多宗登革熱相關死亡個案。世衞於二○二四年更錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點普遍流行，印度尼西亞、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年至今已分別錄得超過二萬宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過2 900宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得140宗本地感染病例，於七月七日至十三日的一周內已錄得51宗，其中以廣州、中山、佛山和潮州錄得的病例最多。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

徐樂堅醫生補充：「本港經常有外地傳入的登革熱個案，每年間中亦有零星的本地登革熱個案。由於香港存在白紋伊蚊，本地市民有機會受感染。炎熱多雨的季節有利蚊子迅速繁殖。如控蚊成效不足，更有爆發登革熱的風險。因此，控蚊工作至關重要。不論在本地或外遊時，應時刻保持環境衞生、注意防蚊控蚊及採取個人保護措施。大家應緊記防止蚊子滋生及避免被蚊叮是預防登革熱的最佳方法。市民如從受登革熱影響地區回港，應在14日內繼續使用昆蟲驅避劑。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節。」

市民應繼續採取下列防蚊措施：


徹底檢查集水溝氣隔、屋頂雨水槽、明渠及排水渠，避免淤塞；
每星期至少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，以除去可能積聚的蚊卵；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，盡量避免使用墊碟；
在雨季前把凹凸不平的地面填平；
避免在叢林逗留；及
戶外活動期間，做好個人保護措施，穿着淺色長袖上衣和長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服上塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。


​含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，市民應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%＊；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；及

Update on dengue fever,2025-07-25 18:30,2025-07-25 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500751.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (July 25) reported the latest number of dengue fever (DF) cases. The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, reminded the public that during the summer months with high temperature and heavy rainfall, the mosquito infestation is expected to aggravate in Hong Kong. In addition, members of the public will travel to DF-endemic regions more frequently during the summer holiday. Therefore, the risk of DF in Hong Kong is increasing.

  From July 18 to yesterday (July 24), the CHP recorded three imported DF cases. The patients had travelled to Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand during the incubation period.

As of yesterday, 33 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases. In 2023, 62 imported cases of DF were recorded.

  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases and more than 7 300 dengue-related deaths were reported in over 80 countries/territories. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number.

  DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 20 000 cases so far this year. Singapore also recorded over 2 900 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 140 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 51 cases were recorded in a week between July 7 and 13, with the highest number of cases recorded in Guangzhou, Zhongshan, Foshan and Chaozhou.

  Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

  ""There have been frequent imported cases of dengue fever in Hong Kong, as well as occasional sporadic local cases every year. The presence of Aedes albopictus in Hong Kong makes our population vulnerable. Mosquitoes breed quickly during the hot and rainy summer months. There are risks of DF outbreaks if mosquito control is inadequate. Hence, mosquito control is of paramount importance. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. The public is reminded that eliminating mosquito breeding sites and avoiding mosquito bites are key to preventing DF. Those returning from areas affected by DF should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. If feeling unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to a doctor,"" Dr Tsui added.

  Members of the public are also reminded to take heed of the following advice on mosquito control:


Thoroughly check all gully traps, roof gutters, surface channels and drains to prevent blockage;
Scrub and clean drains and surface channels with an alkaline detergent compound at least once a week to remove any deposited mosquito eggs;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxes, in covered litter containers;
Completely change the water of flowers and plants at least once a week. The use of saucers should be avoided if possible;
Level irregular ground surfaces before the rainy season;
Avoid staying in shrubby areas; and
Take personal protective measures such as wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothes and trousers, and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or uncovered areas of the body when doing outdoor activities.


âDEET-containing insect repellents are effective and the public should take heed of the tips below:


Read the label instructions carefully first;
Apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
Apply on exposed skin and clothing;
Use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children*;
Apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent; and
Reapply only when needed and follow the instructions.

* For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the DF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook PageandYouTube Channel."
GREEN$ Electronic Participation Incentive Scheme to be fully digitalised (with photos),2025-07-25 18:25,2025-07-25 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500711.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) announced today (July 25) that, along with technological advancements, the GREEN$ Electronic Participation Incentive Scheme (GREEN$ ePIS) will be fully digitised on April 1, 2026. The digitalisation will enhance the connections of GREEN$ ePIS with more reward platforms and gift redemption locations in the market. Members of the public will no longer be required to visit GREEN@COMMUNITY to redeem a limited selection of around 10 types of gifts. Instead, they can redeem their favourite or required gifts at more than 500 supermarkets and retail stores, as well as free MTR tickets and local ecotours, through the GREEN$ mobile app.

  The EPD spokesperson said, ""Among the approximately 1.06 million current users of GREEN$ ePIS, about 920 000 users (i.e. 87 per cent), are already using the mobile app, allowing them to transition seamlessly to full digitisation. To encourage physical card users to switch to the GREEN$ mobile app promptly and enjoy the benefits of digitalisation, the EPD will launch a summer promotion to offer an extra 50 GREEN$ points to those who return their physical cards and switch to the use of the GREEN$ mobile app during the period from August 1 to September 30, 2025.""

  All the facilities of GREEN@COMMUNITY will post notices to inform the public of the arrangements. The public will have time to adapt and transition to the new arrangements, with physical gifts remaining available for redemption at GREEN@COMMUNITY until the first quarter of 2026. Physical cards will cease operation on April 1, 2026. Staff of GREEN@COMMUNITY will assist the public in installing the GREEN$ mobile app, and demonstrate how to use the e-point redemption feature. For the few people without smartphones, their existing physical cards will not be cancelled. They can register their cards at designated facilities of GREEN@COMMUNITY and continue to use the GREEN$ points in the physical cards for redeeming gifts.

Time-saving and convenient with more choices

  The five most popular gifts at GREEN@COMMUNITY in the past years have been daily necessities including rice, cooking oil, toilet paper, and soy milk (see Annex for details). These popular items can all be redeemed using GREEN$ points after being converted into MoneyBack points at over 500 supermarkets and retail stores across the city. The GREEN$ mobile app also allows users to redeem points from the MTR's carbon emission reduction reward platform Carbon Walletfor free MTR tickets and local ecotours.

  Members of the public can continue to donate GREEN$ points to charitable organisations after the full digitisation. The EPD will follow up with the concerned charitable organisations on the arrangements for redemption of e-rewards following the digitisation.

  The e-reward redemption option has been well received by the public since its launch. Following the introduction of the MoneyBack redemption function in December 2024, the monthly GREEN$ points used to redeem MoneyBack points have grown over two times from 7 million points last December to 24 million points in May this year, with about 28 000 users enjoying the MoneyBack point conversion feature (see Annex for details).

  As the e-reward redemption option is currently in its initial trial phase, a redemption limit (3,000 points per account each month) is set to allow more users to try out the new e-reward redemption option. The EPD is planning to introduce more e-reward platforms for point conversions within this year to provide the public with more choices, and the current monthly redemption limit will be lifted progressively.

  The service contracts for Carbon Wallet and MoneyBack were awarded through open tender processes. Service providers participating in the bidding submitted quotations based on their respective costs and other commercial considerations. The service contracts encompass the provision of e-points for conversion and other related services (including promotions, technical support for reward platforms and customer service etc).

Smart city, smart recycling

  With years of efforts by the EPD and support from the public, GREEN$ ePIS has gradually evolved from an incentive scheme into a platform that facilitates collaborative efforts from various sectors of society to promote green waste reduction and a recycling culture. It has successfully mobilised the public to participate in waste separation, recycling as well as fostering recycling habits, driving the quantity of recyclables collected by GREEN@COMMUNITY at the same time. In 2024, about 41 800 tonnes of recyclables (excluding food waste) were collected at GREEN@COMMUNITY, an increase by nearly 60 per cent compared to 2023, while in the first half of 2025, about 22 700 tonnes (excluding food waste) were collected, representing a further increase of about 20 per cent compared to the same period last year. (see Annex for details)

  The spokesperson said, ""Through relentless efforts, the current-term Government has successfully reversed the long-standing trend of increasing waste volume and declining recycling rates in Hong Kong. The GREEN$ mobile app was also awarded the Google Play Hong Kong 'Best App for Good' award in 2024. We look forward to collaborating with all individuals and organisations supporting waste reduction and recycling to further promote GREEN$ ePIS, working together to further enhance Hong Kong's culture of green waste reduction and recycling."""

基督教聯合醫院公布早前一宗涉及置入鼻胃喉程序事件的根源分析報告,2025-07-25 17:46,2025-07-25 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500666.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

基督教聯合醫院發言人今日（七月二十五日）公布一宗涉及置入鼻胃喉程序事件的根源分析報告︰

本院一名耳鼻喉科病人於五月二十六日接受手術期間，獲安排置入鼻胃喉供手術後輸注藥物及營養奶。病人手術後入住深切治療科病房接受緊密監察，並獲安排X光檢查確認鼻胃喉位置，惟醫生其後未有檢視有關X光影像。護士其後為病人進行胃液酸鹼值測試後，按照所得讀數及既定準則，並跟從醫生指示用鼻胃喉為病人輸注藥物及營養奶。醫護人員隨後再為病人檢查時，懷疑鼻胃喉位置偏離，隨即停止輸注及移除鼻胃喉。有關病人臨床情況持續改善，已於六月底出院。

本院於五月三十日公布事件及成立根源分析委員會展開調查。委員會經調查後認為，導致今次事件的主要原因是深切治療科缺乏一套閉環機制，確保在病人進行鼻胃喉輸注前，先檢視X光影像以確認鼻胃喉的位置。

委員會認為事件亦涉及其他因素，包括臨床交接程序中，未有涵蓋X光影像的檢視情況，導致交接的醫療團隊均未有察覺X光影像沒有被檢視；缺乏機制提醒醫生跟進未檢視的X光影像；此外，病人胃液樣本的酸鹼值讀數與胃液的酸鹼值吻合，亦令醫護人員誤以為鼻胃喉被置入正確位置。

委員會提出以下改善建議：

1. 於深切治療科設立閉環機制，提示醫護人員為病人進行鼻胃喉輸注前必須檢視X光影像以確認喉管位置；

2. 將檢視X光影像列為臨床交接及術後早期檢查清單的恆常項目，確保為深切治療科病人輸注前以X光影像確認鼻胃喉位置；

3. 在深切治療科的電子臨床資訊系統中，加入確認鼻胃喉位置作為標準化紀錄；

4. 檢視及更新相關護理臨床指引；及

5. 安排深切治療科醫護人員參與優化醫療團隊管理模擬訓練，加強溝通、團隊合作、情境意識及決策。

本院會跟進及落實執行有關建議，並已聯絡病人及家屬解釋調查結果，再次向他們致歉，醫院病人關係組會繼續為家屬提供所需協助。

本院已向醫院管理局（醫管局）總辦事處呈交報告，謹向根源分析委員會所有成員致謝，委員會名單如下︰

The spokesperson for United Christian Hospital (UCH) today (25 July) announced the root cause analysis report of an incident involving the insertion of a nasogastric tube.

A patient, under the Ear, Nose and Throat Department of UCH, underwent surgery on May 26, during which a nasogastric tube was inserted to facilitate postoperative administration of medication and feeding of formula milk. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for close monitoring after the surgery and was arranged for an X-ray examination to verify the position of the nasogastric tube. However, the X-ray image was not reviewed by a doctor afterwards. The nurse then performed a pH test on the gastric aspirate from the patient's nasogastric tube and began nasogastric tube feeding for the patient with drugs and formula milk according to the pH test result, established protocols, and the doctor's order. Healthcare staff later reviewed the patient and suspected that there was a malposition of the nasogastric tube. Feeding was terminated, and the nasogastric tube was removed immediately. The patient's clinical condition continued to improve, and the patient was discharged in late June.

UCH announced the incident on May 30 and appointed a Root Cause Analysis Panel for investigation. After reviewing the case, the Panel concluded that the main cause leading to the incident was the lack of a closed-loop mechanism in the ICU to ascertain that X-ray images were reviewed to verify the position of the nasogastric tube before initiating nasogastric tube feeding for patients.

The Panel believed that the incident also involved other contributing factors, including the X-ray images' review status not being incorporated into the clinical handover process, which led to clinical teams involved not noticing that the X-ray images had not been reviewed; and the lack of a mechanism to alert doctors to follow up on the unreviewed X-ray images. Moreover, the pH test result from the patient's gastric aspirate sample was consistent with the pH reading of gastric fluid, which led the clinical team to mistakenly believe that the nasogastric tube was in the right position.

The Panel made the following recommendations:

1. Establish a closed-loop mechanism in the ICU to alert clinical teams to review X-ray images to ascertain the position of the tube before initiating nasogastric tube feeding for patients;

2. Incorporate X-ray image review into the clinical handover process and postoperative checklist to ensure that X-ray images are reviewed to ascertain the position of the nasogastric tube before initiating nasogastric tube feeding for ICU patients;

3. Utilise electronic Clinical Information System in the ICU to standardise the clinical documentation of nasogastric tube position;

4. Review and update relevant nursing clinical guidelines; and

5. Arrange ICU healthcare staff to attend Crew Resources Management simulation training for improving team communication, teamwork, situational awareness and decision making.

UCH will take follow-up actions to implement the recommendations. The hospital has explained the report's findings to the patient and family concerned and expressed its apology again to them. Patient Relations Team shall continue to provide necessary assistance to the family.

The report has been submitted to the Hospital Authority (HA) Head Office. The hospital expressed gratitude for the work of the Root Cause Analysis Panel. The membership of the panel is as follows:

"Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected controlled cosmetic injections worth about $76,000 (with photo)",2025-07-25 17:46,2025-07-25 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500722.htm,"Hong Kong Customs on July 16 and 17 seized 249 pieces of suspected controlled cosmetic injections with an estimated market value of about $76,000. Some of the seized cosmetic injections were suspected to contain Part 1 poisons.

Through risk assessment, Customs on July 16 inspected an express parcel, declared as carrying body lotion, imported from Korea to Hong Kong via the Shenzhen Bay Control Point. Upon inspection, Customs officers found 20 cosmetic injection vials suspected to contain Part 1 poisons in the parcel.

After a follow-up investigation, Customs officers conducted a controlled delivery operation the following day (July 17) at the consignee's address in Hung Hom and arrested two persons suspected to be connected with the case: a 20-year-old man who collected the parcel and a 45-year-old female consignee. Two hundred and twenty-nine pieces of suspected controlled cosmetic injections, some of which were suspected to contain Part 1 poisons, with an estimated market value of about $59,000, were further seized at the consignee's address.

An investigation is ongoing, and the arrested persons have been released on bail pending further investigation.

Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction. Any person who imports pharmaceutical products and medicines without a valid import licence commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for two years.

Under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance, any person who possesses any poison included in Part 1 of the Poisons List other than in accordance with provisions commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected violation of the above-mentioned ordinances to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
CHP announces new melioidosis case,2025-07-25 17:45,2025-07-25 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500608.htm," The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (July 25) announced that one new melioidosis case was recorded in the past week (July 18 to 24).

 The case involves a 62-year-old male with underlying medical conditions. He resided in Sham Shui Po, and developed abdominal discomfort and poor appetite on July 14. He attended Caritas Medical Centre on July 16 and was admitted for treatment on the same day. During his hospitalisation, he developed a fever and was diagnosed with pneumonia. His blood specimen tested positive for Burkholderia pseudomallei. He passed away on July 23 due to pneumonia and underlying medical conditions. He was previously diagnosed with melioidosis in April 2022 and had recovered after hospitalisation. The possibility of a relapsed infection could not be excluded.

 The CHP is investigating the infection source of the case. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing.

 As of July 24, eight melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded.

 Person-to-person transmission and animal-to-human transmission are rare, but the bacteria causing melioidosis can survive in the local environment. Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong, and melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year.

 According to literature, melioidosis cases are more common after typhoons or rainstorms. The bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei in soil and muddy water may become exposed to the ground after typhoons or rainstorms, and the bacteria could spread more easily with strong winds or rainstorms. As such, the number of melioidosis cases may increase.

 With this in mind, where practicable, members of the public should stay indoors during typhoons and rainstorms, avoid travelling to areas with potential flooding, and do not wade in or have contact with muddy water and soil. In addition, high-risk individuals should avoid paths near stormwater drains where aerosols may be generated from contaminated water.

 Members of the public should also take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. using gloves and wearing boots. High-risk individuals may also consider wearing a surgical mask;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover them with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soil or gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.

 â
 âThe CHP appealed to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromising conditions, in order to receive an appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment. For more information on melioidosis, please visit the website of the CHP at www.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html."
衞生防護中心公布新增一宗類鼻疽個案,2025-07-25 17:45,2025-07-25 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500607.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（七月二十五日）表示，過去一星期（七月十八日至二十四日），中心錄得一宗新增類鼻疽個案。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的62歲男子。他居於深水埗，在七月十四日出現腹部不適和食慾不振，七月十六日到明愛醫院求診，同日入院接受治療。他留院期間出現發燒，並被診斷有肺炎。他的血液樣本經化驗證實對類鼻疽伯克氏菌呈陽性反應。病人於七月二十三日因肺炎及本身長期病患去世。病人於二○二二年四月亦曾確診類鼻疽，入院治療後已康復，不排除是次為復發感染。

中心正調查個案的感染源頭和進行流行病學調查。

截至七月二十四日，本港今年錄得八宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。

導致類鼻疽的病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可存活於本地環境。類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得類鼻疽個案。

根據文獻，類鼻疽個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令病菌更容易散播，從而令類鼻疽個案有機會增加。

就此，颱風和暴雨期間市民應盡量留在室內，避免前往可能出現水浸的地區，亦不應涉水或接觸泥水和泥土。同時，高風險人士應避免使用雨水渠道附近的道路，以免接觸可能由污水產生的氣溶膠。

市民亦應採取以下措施預防感染：

• 避免接觸受污染的土壤；
• 進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿着適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴，高風險人士可考慮額外佩戴外科口罩；
• 接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
• 盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
• 接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
• 注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
• 外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。就更多有關類鼻疽的資料，市民可參閱中心網站www.chp.gov.hk/tc/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html。"

Persons wanted for suspected contravention of Hong Kong National Security Law,2025-07-25 17:22,2025-07-25 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500736.htm,"The National Security Department of the Hong Kong Police Force today (July 25) announced that 19 persons suspected of committing offences under the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong National Security Law) by organising, establishing, or participating in, outside Hong Kong, a subversive organisation named the “Hong Kong Parliament” have been put on wanted list, with reward in respect of each wanted person being offered. The court has, upon application by Police, issued arrest warrants against the following persons at large:

(1) Nine persons including male Yuan Gong-yi, male Ho Leung-mau Victor, male Fok Ka-chi, male Choi Ming-da, female Chan Lai-chun, male Feng Chongyi, female Gong Sasha, male Ng Man-yan and male Tsang Wai-fan, who organised, outside the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), election for the “Hong Kong Parliament” to establish the so-called “Hong Kong Parliament”; and

(2) Ten persons including female Chin Po-fun, male Ha Hoi-chun Paul, male Hau Chung-yu, male Ho Wing-yau, male Keung Ka-wai, male Lam Tony, female Ng Agnes, male Wong Chun-wah, male Wong Sau-wo and female Zhang Xinyan, who participated as candidates in the “Hong Kong Parliament” election and, upon being elected, took an oath to serve as so-called “members of the Hong Kong Parliament”.

The “Hong Kong Parliament” aims to subvert state power; its objectives include promoting “self-determination”, promulgating the so-called “Hong Kong Constitution”, and overthrowing or undermining the basic system of the People’s Republic of China established by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China or overthrowing the body of the central power of People’s Republic of China or the body of power of the HKSAR with unlawful means, thereby suspected of committing the offence of “Subversion” contrary to Article 22 of the Hong Kong National Security Law. Thus, Police applied to the court for arrest warrants in accordance with the law and put the persons on wanted list. The legal basis and basic facts for putting the persons on the wanted list are in the Annex.

Amongst the aforementioned fugitives, Yuan Gong-yi, Ho Leung-mau Victor, Fok Ka-chi and Choi Ming-da have been put on wanted list with a reward of HK$1 million each for suspected of committing offences endangering national security. The Secretary for Security has also exercised powers conferred by section 89 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, in June and December 2024, to specify Yuan Gong-yi, Fok Ka-chi and Choi Ming-da as absconders and to specify the measures to be applied against them by notices published in Gazette. Police will continue to make every effort to bring all the wanted persons to justice.

For the remaining 15 wanted persons, a reward of HK$200,000 in respect of each of them is being offered by Police to any member of the public, who can provide information on the wanted persons or related cases. The investigation is ongoing, and further persons will be put on wanted list with rewards offered if necessary.

Police reiterated that “endangering national security is a very serious offence, and such acts or activities may lead to extremely serious consequences. According to Article 37 of the Hong Kong National Security Law, this Law shall apply to a person who is a permanent resident of the HKSAR or an incorporated or unincorporated body such as a company or an organisation which is set up in the HKSAR if the person or the body commits an offence under the Hong Kong National Security Law outside the HKSAR. Additionally, Article 38 of the Hong Kong National Security Law stipulates that this Law shall apply to offences under this Law committed against the HSKAR from outside the HKSAR by a person who is not a permanent resident of the HKSAR. Therefore, the Hong Kong Police Force has the responsibility to pursue, in accordance with the law, persons suspected of committing offences under the Hong Kong National Security Law outside Hong Kong.”

“According to Article 33 of the Hong Kong National Security Law, if an offender voluntarily discontinues the commission of the offence; voluntarily surrenders himself or herself and gives a truthful account of the offence; or reports on the offence committed by other person or provides material information which assists in solving other criminal case, a lighter penalty may be imposed, or the penalty may be reduced. The above wanted persons are urged to surrender to Hong Kong Police over their roles in engaging in endangering national security activities, so as to rectify their mistakes.”

Police also pointed out that no matter in what ways, including through the internet, it is illegal for any person to aid, abet or provide pecuniary or other financial assistance or property to other persons for participating in any illegal activities related to the “Hong Kong Parliament” or to commit other offences endangering national security. Police urge members of the public to abide by the law and Police will strictly enforce the law."

​政務司司長在北京出席十五運會籌辦情況新聞發布會（附圖／短片）,2025-07-25 17:12,2025-07-25 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500695.htm,"第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）組織委員會副主任、香港特別行政區（特區）政府政務司司長陳國基今日（七月二十五日）下午在北京出席由國務院新聞辦公室舉行，介紹十五運會籌辦情況的新聞發布會，與國家體育總局、廣東省和澳門特區相關官員一同介紹十五運會的籌辦進展和亮點。

陳國基回應有關香港承辦賽事的優勢時說：「香港早前成功舉辦十五運會的測試賽，充分展現香港承辦大型賽事的能力。香港作為國際化大都市，擁有優越的地理位置和交通便利性，吸引國際和內地遊客以及媒體往來。憑藉『一國兩制』下的制度優勢和地緣優勢，再加上背靠祖國、聯通世界的區位優勢，香港有經驗、有能力承辦大型體育賽事，為國家體育發展貢獻一份堅實力量。」

「香港體育基礎設施完備，尤其是新落成的啟德體育園，已經成為香港的體育地標，連同香港單車館及粉嶺高爾夫球場等完善設施，構成辦賽的堅實硬件基礎。同時，香港累積了豐富的大型賽事籌辦經驗，包括香港馬拉松、國際七人欖球賽等不同國際賽事，展現出高效的協調及執行能力。」

關於全國運動會（全運會）促進香港體育發展方面，陳國基說全運會是國家最大型的綜合運動會，辦好全運會不單有助提升香港的國際體育地位，更激勵青年投入體育事業，培育本地運動員及運動管理人才，長遠促進香港的運動産業發展。

他續說：「在國家體育總局的全力支持和協助下，香港與內地相關部門建立常態化溝通機制，在賽事組織、場地準備、義工培訓、安保措施等方面緊密對接、密切協作，充分體現協同效應。」

「舉辦全運會是香港特區政府的重要任務。各相關部門通力合作，在各自專業領域上積極準備。完成十五運會後，各部門所累積的經驗，將會為香港特區政府未來承接更多大型體育盛事做好準備。」

有關三地協作舉辦賽事時遇到的挑戰，陳國基說：「十五運會由粵港澳三地共同承辦，公路自行車和田徑馬拉松兩個項目首次以跨境形式進行，以展現三地共同承辦十五運會的特色，是本屆全運會的亮點。」

「賽事涉及粵港澳，每個細節都需要三地政府共同籌劃和密切配合。在籌辦過程中，三地一直保持緊密交流，包括視察跨境路線、統籌相關部門和單位召開工作會議等，其間有不少挑戰，例如封路安排、關口臨時管控、賽事期間閉環管理、沿途車隊護送；以及利用科技確保通關『零延時、零接觸、零等待』，車隊及運動員不會偏離賽道等，當中牽涉大量協調工作。」

他又說，粵港澳三地透過協辦跨境項目，開展了三地共同推動、共同協作的競賽組織方式，加強香港與其他粵港澳大灣區城市，以至內地其他地區的體育交流合作。三地政府部門以至體育界之間在政策、人才培訓、設施、訓練、管理和技術等多方面交流；並以全運會賽事活動激發香港市民對運動的熱情、參與和支持，進一步增強香港在大灣區體育事業的影響力，共同推進大灣區體育產業發展，推動在未來聯合打造一批國際性、區域性品牌賽事，吸引更多大型賽事落戶香港和大灣區，促進香港和大灣區的體育産業長遠發展。

就承辦十五運會對香港融入國家發展大局的作用，陳國基表示，本屆為首次由粵港澳三地共同承辦的全運會，香港也是首次參與承辦這項全國體育盛事，意義特別重大；不但能提升香港籌辦大型體育盛事的能力、推動粵港澳大灣區體育産業發展，更是讓香港更好融入國家發展大局的重要契機。

《粵港澳大灣區發展規劃綱要》明確提出，「共同推進大灣區體育事業和體育産業發展，聯合打造一批國際性、區域性品牌賽事」，陳國基說十五運會將進一步為大灣區體育交流、人民交往和經濟協同等領域創造新機遇。而為方便內地旅客來港觀賽，組委會正積極爭取內地居民赴港簽注利便措施，讓旅客可跟着賽事去旅遊，進一步推動大灣區的體育和旅遊融合發展。

陳國基指出，三地透過聯合辦賽，有效建立粵港澳多層聯絡機制，包括常態會議、聯合工作小組等。此外，三地政府共同努力下，在重點領域達成共識，包括跨境通關、物資調配、食品安全、綠色賽事等互認合作，為大灣區探索「一事三地、一策三地、一規三地」提供實踐機會，也為打造大灣區成為世界一流的多元化城市群創造新篇章。

CS attends press conference on preparations for 15th National Games in Beijing (with photo/video),2025-07-25 17:12,2025-07-25 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500700.htm,"  The Vice President of the Organising Committee of the 15th National Games (NG) and Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, attended a press conference on preparations for the 15th NG organised by the Information Office of the State Council this afternoon (July 25) in Beijing. Mr Chan, along with relevant officials from the General Administration of Sport of China, Guangdong Province and the Macao Special Administrative Region, introduced the progress of the preparations and highlights of the 15th NG.

  As regards Hong Kong's advantages in organising competition events, Mr Chan said, ""The successful test events for the 15th NG held in Hong Kong have showcased the city's capability to organise large-scale competitions. As a cosmopolitan city, Hong Kong's strategic location and convenient transportation have attracted both overseas and Mainland tourists, as well as media. Leveraging its institutional and geographical strengths from 'one country, two systems', along with the unique advantage of having strong support from the motherland and close connection with the world, Hong Kong can serve as a solid force in national sports development, backed by rich experience and the capability to organise large-scale sports events.

  ""Hong Kong boasts a comprehensive sports infrastructure. The newly completed Kai Tak Sports Park has emerged as a sports landmark for the city, complemented by top-tier facilities such as the Hong Kong Velodrome and Fanling Golf Course, creating a solid foundation for hosting competition events. Additionally, Hong Kong has accumulated extensive experience in organising large-scale events, including the Hong Kong Marathon and the Hong Kong Sevens, demonstrating its efficient co-ordination and execution capabilities.""

  Regarding the promotion of sports development in Hong Kong via the NG, Mr Chan stated that the NG is the largest multisport event in the country. Hosting the NG successfully will not only enhance Hong Kong's international standing in sports but also encourage young people to pursue careers in sports. This will help cultivate local athletes and sports management professionals, fostering long-term growth in Hong Kong's sports industry.

  He continued, ""With the full support and assistance of the General Administration of Sport of China, the relevant departments of Hong Kong and the Mainland have established a regular communication mechanism, closely liaising and co-ordinating on aspects including event organisation, venue preparation, volunteer training and security measures, fully manifesting the synergy effect.

  ""Hosting the NG is a major priority for the HKSAR Government. Relevant departments are working together and actively preparing in their respective professional fields. Upon the completion of the 15th NG, the experience gained by each department will form the foundation for the HKSAR Government to pursue more mega sports events in the future.""

  Addressing the challenges of tripartite collaboration for the competitions, Mr Chan said, ""The first-ever cross-boundary road cycling and athletics marathon are signature events of the 15th NG cohosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, highlighting the unique feature of the three places cohosting the NG.

  ""The cohosting of the events by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao requires meticulous tripartite planning and co-ordination. Throughout the preparation and organisation phases, the governments of the three places have maintained close exchanges, including visits to cross-boundary routes and co-ordination among relevant departments and units for working meetings. Substantial co-ordination is required to overcome various challenges, such as managing road closures, implementing temporary control measures at control points, ensuring closed-loop arrangements throughout the events, and providing motorcade escorts. Additionally, leveraging technology is essential to guarantee 'zero delay, zero contact, and zero waiting time' during clearance, while preventing race convoys and athletes from deviating off course.""

  He added that by organising cross-boundary events, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have pioneered a cohosting approach that involves joint promotion and collaboration among the three places to strengthen exchanges and collaborations in sports between Hong Kong and the other Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) cities, as well as other Mainland regions. Government departments and sports sectors of the three places share experiences in areas such as policies, talent development, facilities, training, management and skills. The NG competition events will also stimulate Hong Kong people's passion for sports and encourage their participation and support, further increasing Hong Kong's influence in the development of sports in the GBA. The three places will jointly promote the development of the sports industry in the GBA to create international and regional brand events and attract more major events to be held in Hong Kong and the GBA, thereby facilitating the long-term development of the sports industry in Hong Kong and the GBA.

  On the role of hosting the 15th NG in Hong Kong's integration into the overall development of the country, Mr Chan stated that this is the first time the NG is cohosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, as well as the first time Hong Kong is hosting this national sports event, which is of great significance. It will not only enhance Hong Kong's ability to organise mega sports events and promote the development of the sports industry in the GBA, but also provide an important opportunity for Hong Kong to better integrate into the national development.

  The Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area clearly sets out that the three places will jointly advance the development of sports and sports-related industries in the GBA and organise international and regional sports events. Mr Chan said that the 15th NG will further create new opportunities for sports exchanges, foster communication among people, and stimulate economic synergies in the GBA. To facilitate Mainland tourists attending the games in Hong Kong, the Organising Committee is actively seeking to secure more facilitation measures for exit endorsements for Mainland residents travelling to Hong Kong, enabling tourists to combine their trips with the competitions and further promoting the integration of sports and tourism development in the GBA.

  Mr Chan noted that by cohosting competition events, the three places have effectively established a multi-level liaison mechanism among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, which includes regular meetings and joint working groups. In addition, through the concerted efforts of the governments of the three places, a consensus has been reached on mutual recognition and co-operation in key areas, including cross-boundary customs clearance, supplies distribution, food safety and green events, thereby providing practical opportunities to explore the implementation of ""one matter, three places"", ""one policy, three places"", and ""one regulation, three places"" in the GBA, and creating a new chapter in developing the GBA into a world-class, diversified city cluster.

  Mr Chan also mentioned that the 15th NG embodies the mutually beneficial sharing of expertise and resources among the three places, promoting the integration of culture, sports and tourism in the GBA while igniting public passion through the competitions. By participating as home spectators in national events, Hong Kong people can witness the indomitable spirit of Mainland athletes, enhancing their pride in the country. Moreover, over 17 000 volunteers have been recruited for the competition events to be hosted in Hong Kong, making it the largest volunteer unit to date. This not only strengthens societal cohesion but also fully demonstrates Hong Kong people's dedication to serving the community and supporting national mega events.

  Officials attending today's press conference included Deputy Director of the General Administration of Sport of China Mr Tong Lixin; the Vice President of the Organising Committee of the 15th NG and Standing Committee member of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, Mr Wang Xi; Mr Chan; and the Vice President of the Organising Committee of the 15th NG and Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture of the Macao Special Administrative Region Government, Ms O Lam."
​政務司司長在北京出席十五運會籌辦情況新聞發布會（附圖）,2025-07-25 17:12,2025-07-25 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500695.htm,"第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）組織委員會副主任、香港特別行政區（特區）政府政務司司長陳國基今日（七月二十五日）下午在北京出席由國務院新聞辦公室舉行，介紹十五運會籌辦情況的新聞發布會，與國家體育總局、廣東省和澳門特區相關官員一同介紹十五運會的籌辦進展和亮點。

陳國基回應有關香港承辦賽事的優勢時說：「香港早前成功舉辦十五運會的測試賽，充分展現香港承辦大型賽事的能力。香港作為國際化大都市，擁有優越的地理位置和交通便利性，吸引國際和內地遊客以及媒體往來。憑藉『一國兩制』下的制度優勢和地緣優勢，再加上背靠祖國、聯通世界的區位優勢，香港有經驗、有能力承辦大型體育賽事，為國家體育發展貢獻一份堅實力量。」

「香港體育基礎設施完備，尤其是新落成的啟德體育園，已經成為香港的體育地標，連同香港單車館及粉嶺高爾夫球場等完善設施，構成辦賽的堅實硬件基礎。同時，香港累積了豐富的大型賽事籌辦經驗，包括香港馬拉松、國際七人欖球賽等不同國際賽事，展現出高效的協調及執行能力。」

關於全國運動會（全運會）促進香港體育發展方面，陳國基說全運會是國家最大型的綜合運動會，辦好全運會不單有助提升香港的國際體育地位，更激勵青年投入體育事業，培育本地運動員及運動管理人才，長遠促進香港的運動産業發展。

他續說：「在國家體育總局的全力支持和協助下，香港與內地相關部門建立常態化溝通機制，在賽事組織、場地準備、義工培訓、安保措施等方面緊密對接、密切協作，充分體現協同效應。」

「舉辦全運會是香港特區政府的重要任務。各相關部門通力合作，在各自專業領域上積極準備。完成十五運會後，各部門所累積的經驗，將會為香港特區政府未來承接更多大型體育盛事做好準備。」

有關三地協作舉辦賽事時遇到的挑戰，陳國基說：「十五運會由粵港澳三地共同承辦，公路自行車和田徑馬拉松兩個項目首次以跨境形式進行，以展現三地共同承辦十五運會的特色，是本屆全運會的亮點。」

「賽事涉及粵港澳，每個細節都需要三地政府共同籌劃和密切配合。在籌辦過程中，三地一直保持緊密交流，包括視察跨境路線、統籌相關部門和單位召開工作會議等，其間有不少挑戰，例如封路安排、關口臨時管控、賽事期間閉環管理、沿途車隊護送；以及利用科技確保通關『零延時、零接觸、零等待』，車隊及運動員不會偏離賽道等，當中牽涉大量協調工作。」

他又說，粵港澳三地透過協辦跨境項目，開展了三地共同推動、共同協作的競賽組織方式，加強香港與其他粵港澳大灣區城市，以至內地其他地區的體育交流合作。三地政府部門以至體育界之間在政策、人才培訓、設施、訓練、管理和技術等多方面交流；並以全運會賽事活動激發香港市民對運動的熱情、參與和支持，進一步增強香港在大灣區體育事業的影響力，共同推進大灣區體育產業發展，推動在未來聯合打造一批國際性、區域性品牌賽事，吸引更多大型賽事落戶香港和大灣區，促進香港和大灣區的體育産業長遠發展。

就承辦十五運會對香港融入國家發展大局的作用，陳國基表示，本屆為首次由粵港澳三地共同承辦的全運會，香港也是首次參與承辦這項全國體育盛事，意義特別重大；不但能提升香港籌辦大型體育盛事的能力、推動粵港澳大灣區體育産業發展，更是讓香港更好融入國家發展大局的重要契機。

《粵港澳大灣區發展規劃綱要》明確提出，「共同推進大灣區體育事業和體育産業發展，聯合打造一批國際性、區域性品牌賽事」，陳國基說十五運會將進一步為大灣區體育交流、人民交往和經濟協同等領域創造新機遇。而為方便內地旅客來港觀賽，組委會正積極爭取內地居民赴港簽注利便措施，讓旅客可跟着賽事去旅遊，進一步推動大灣區的體育和旅遊融合發展。

陳國基指出，三地透過聯合辦賽，有效建立粵港澳多層聯絡機制，包括常態會議、聯合工作小組等。此外，三地政府共同努力下，在重點領域達成共識，包括跨境通關、物資調配、食品安全、綠色賽事等互認合作，為大灣區探索「一事三地、一策三地、一規三地」提供實踐機會，也為打造大灣區成為世界一流的多元化城市群創造新篇章。

他又提到十五運會將三地的優勢資源進行互利互補，推動大灣區文體旅融合的同時，亦以賽事激發市民的熱情。一方面，香港市民直接參與國家盛事，主場觀賽，見證國家運動健兒的拼搏精神，深化國民自豪感；另一方面，香港特區招募了超過17 000名義工，是香港歷來最大的義工團隊，既增進社會凝聚力，也充分表現香港市民服務社會的熱誠，以及對國家大型盛事的支持。

 During the visit, the Senior Vice President (Sustainability) for Technology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship at InvestHK, Ms Olivia To, engaged with key stakeholders in London and Cambridge to foster two-way business opportunities and deepen co-operation in sustainability and green tech innovation.

 In London, Ms To held extensive discussions with leading UK's new energy, new materials and digital companies, as well as UK Research and Innovation, the national funding agency investing in science and research, Sustainable Ventures, a leading green tech hub and ecosystem provider, Generation Investment Management, a sustainable investment management firm, London & Partners, London's business growth and destination agency, and London GreenCity, a clean technology entrepreneurs accelerator providing prototyping lab and collaborative community.

 In Cambridge, Ms To spoke at the event titled ""Powering Tomorrow: Deep Tech Innovations for a Sustainable Energy Future"", co-organised by the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership and Full Vision Capital, highlighting the competitive advantages Hong Kong offers energy and technology companies to grow and thrive across the region. The conference featured dynamic keynotes on growth strategies for clean energy start-ups, panel discussions on disruptive energy innovations, and a start-up demo where over 30 start-ups showcased their cutting-edge solutions. The event culminated in the announcement of the 4th TERA-Award Winner receiving a prize of US$1 million and a celebratory Gala Dinner, fostering further global networking and collaboration opportunities.

Eighth Joint Conference on Advancing Hong Kong's Full Participation in and Contribution to Belt and Road Initiative held in Beijing (with photos),2025-07-25 17:00,2025-07-25 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500313.htm," The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and relevant central ministries held the eighth Joint Conference on Advancing Hong Kong's Full Participation in and Contribution to the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI) in Beijing today (July 25).

 Vice Chairman of the NDRC Mr Zhou Haibing attended the conference with Mainland officials led by him, including representatives from the NDRC, the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, the Supreme People's Court, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Transport, the People's Bank of China, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, the National Financial Regulatory Administration, and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR.

 The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, in his capacity as chairperson of the Working Group on Belt and Road (B&R) Development under the Steering Group on Integration into National Development, led HKSAR Government officials to attend the conference. They included the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, who was also the Hong Kong-side Convenor of the Joint Conference, and representatives from the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB), the Department of Justice, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, the Development Bureau, the Environment and Ecology Bureau, the Belt and Road Office of the CEDB, and the Office of the Government of the HKSAR in Beijing. The Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Professor Frederick Ma, and a representative from the Airport Authority Hong Kong also attended the meeting.

 Mr Lam said that the HKSAR Government has been taking forward B&R co-operation to go deeper and deliver outcomes, thereby fully participating in and contributing to the B&RI under the continued guidance of the eight major steps the country has been taking to support high-quality B&R co-operation, with a view to facilitating Hong Kong's active integration into overall national development. With the country's support, Hong Kong will continue to deepen international exchanges and co-operation and will actively utilise its own advantages to exert a greater role in the country's high-level opening up to the world.

 He pointed out that over the past year, the HKSAR Government has actively served as a proponent for institutional openness through Hong Kong's strengths as a platform for two-way opening up; a pioneer for co-operation in new fields through strengths in education, science and technology and talent; and a facilitator for people-to-people bonds through strengths as a melting pot of diversified cultures. The HKSAR Government has been exploring emerging markets such as the Middle East, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other B&R countries, while making full use of Hong Kong's professional services aligned with international standards, thereby building Hong Kong as the gateway between the country and the world and highlighting Hong Kong's role as the premier B&R functional platform. He expressed gratitude to the Central Government for the staunch support of hosting the International Organization for Mediation headquarters in Hong Kong, which will help strengthen Hong Kong's roles as an international dispute resolution services centre and a capital for international mediation.

 Mr Yau stated in the meeting that the HKSAR Government will fully capitalise on the 10th Belt and Road Summit to showcase Hong Kong's important roles as an active participant and the premier B&R functional platform to the Mainland and overseas. He reported on Hong Kong's progress in carrying out B&R work, including the CEDB's ongoing pursuit of the early accession of Hong Kong to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the pursuit of early conclusion of ongoing negotiations for free trade and investment agreements, and actively following up on the plan to establish Economic and Trade Offices in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to fully take forward the economic and trade relations between Hong Kong and B&R countries.

 The meeting also focused its discussion on the seven work proposals on further promoting the B&RI that the HKSAR Government put forward for consideration by central ministries, covering capacity building, deepening exchanges and co-operations with B&R countries, legal and dispute resolution services, cross-boundary financing, and the expansion of international co-operation and ties in innovation and technology. Representatives of relevant Joint Conference Mainland ministries introduced their respective work in supporting Hong Kong's participation in and contribution to the B&RI and provided feedback on the HKSAR Government's work proposals. The HKSAR Government is grateful for the support expressed by relevant central ministries at the meeting on various work proposals and will actively follow up with them.

 In addition, the meeting noted the HKSAR Government's key areas and major work in its future participation and contribution to the B&RI, including leveraging Hong Kong's role as a B&R functional platform to explore business opportunities and facilitating business matching and participation in B&R projects. The HKSAR Government will continue to consolidate Hong Kong's unique advantage of connecting with the Mainland and the rest of the world under ""one country, two systems"", seize the enormous opportunities brought about by national development, strengthen and deepen exchanges and co-operations with B&R countries, and give full play to its role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"".

 The Arrangement between the NDRC and the HKSAR Government for Advancing Hong Kong's Full Participation in and Contribution to the B&RI, signed between the HKSAR Government and the NDRC in 2017, provides the direction and a blueprint for Hong Kong's full participation in and contribution to the B&RI, as well as sets up the Joint Conference mechanism to discuss relevant matters, with meetings convened at least once a year."

Mr Lee welcomed Mr Rasou and his delegation to Hong Kong to attend economic and trade co-operation events. Mr Lee said that Hong Kong is leveraging its advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle of connecting the Mainland and the world and is actively deepening international exchanges and co-operation. He said that, apart from strengthening traditional markets, Hong Kong will further explore emerging markets including Belt and Road countries and expand economic and trade networks with Global South countries including Vanuatu.

Mr Lee noted that, as a functional platform for the Belt and Road Initiative, Hong Kong boasts a highly internationalised, market-oriented, and business-friendly environment, making it an ideal place for companies to expand their global operations. He welcomed enterprises from Vanuatu to leverage Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" to explore overseas and Mainland markets, enhancing bilateral trade and business exchanges.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend.

各位媒體朋友：

下午好。全國運動會（全運會）是國家規模最大、水平最高的綜合運動盛事。香港回歸祖國以來，已參加了七屆全運會。今年，我們歷史性地跟廣東和澳門一起承辦十五運會，意義重大。這體現了國家對香港的高度信任和重託，也將深化粵港澳大灣區體育及各方面的合作交流，推進大灣區高質量發展的新篇章。

香港承辦十五運會，是更好融入國家發展大局、豐富「一國兩制」實踐的重要契機。全運會在大灣區城市舉辦，將進一步增強香港年輕人對國家整體發展和大灣區城市的認識，提升他們的國民身分認同。香港市民有機會在現場觀看國家頂尖運動員風采，感受拼搏精神，更能激發體育熱情，實踐「全運惠民」的理念。

香港特區政府高度重視十五運會的籌備工作，由行政長官親自督導，並早於二○二三年五月已經成立了香港特區賽區籌備委員會。

香港將承辦十五運會八個競賽項目，包括男子22歲以下組籃球、場地自行車、擊劍、高爾夫球、男子手球、七人制橄欖球、鐵人三項和沙灘排球；以及一個群眾賽事活動：保齡球。所有競賽項目的測試賽已順利完成。

我們會貫徹「簡約、安全、精彩」的辦賽原則，充分利用現有場館，包括今年啓用的啟德體育園，加上中環海濱、維多利亞公園等場地，展現香港的國際化多元特色，為這屆全運會增添魅力。我們會結合香港舉辦大型體育賽事和盛事活動的豐富經驗，辦好項目，為國家體育發展貢獻一份堅實的力量。

全運會的舉辦，也將進一步促進粵港澳民心相通，帶動「一程多站」跨境旅遊新格局，為大灣區經濟發展創造新機遇。

為迎接全運會的來臨，香港正積極透過多元化的宣傳活動，全面提升全運會的熱度和參與度。我們將於八月二日在香港舉辦倒計時100天的大型活動，並且在八月三日在全港18區開展以全運會為主題的全民運動日，鼓勵市民多做運動及關注全運會，營造全城期盼的氛圍。

我們期待透過全運會展現香港的國際大都會魅力和活力；推動大灣區內兄弟城市協同互惠發展，推動香港更好融入國家發展大局，共同說好香港故事、灣區故事、中國故事。

開幕在即，香港賽區各項籌備工作正有序全面推進，在遵循「綠色、共享、開放、廉潔」的辦賽理念下，這一屆全運會必定會是一個展現灣區風采的體育盛會。謝謝各位！"

Home and Youth Affairs Bureau announces second-term service arrangements for District Services and Community Care Teams,2025-07-25 15:00,2025-07-25 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500359.htm,"As the first-term service agreements for the District Services and Community Care Teams are coming to an end between late September and mid-October 2025, after reviewing the Care Teams' service outcomes and resource utilisation, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) today (July 25) announced the arrangements for the services in the second term of the Care Teams.

Since the full launch in the third quarter of 2023, Care Teams have been providing caring services to residents in various sub-districts in accordance with their service agreements. As a key component of the Government's efforts to enhance district governance, Care Teams, together with the District Councils and the ""three district committees"", form a well-defined and synergistic ""troika"" governance structure. By consolidating community resources, Care Teams deliver diversified caring and support services to enhance people's sense of well-being and fulfilment, while continuously strengthening the collaboration mechanism with the District Councils and the ""three district committees"" to comprehensively enhance service effectiveness through co-ordinated efforts.

The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs (SHYA), Miss Alice Mak, said, ""Care Teams in all sub-districts have nearly completed their services in accordance with the key performance indicators (KPIs). Some teams have even exceeded the requirements. In terms of resource utilisation, Care Teams adhere to the principle of making optimal use of community and government resources, consolidating community efforts to promote diverse caring services and activities. We are confident that all 452 Care Teams will meet or even surpass the KPIs by the end of the first-term service period.""

Miss Mak added, ""Care Teams have established a solid service foundation in the community. The second-term services will be optimised in three key directions: seamless continuity, tailored to district needs, and deeper and broader services. To ensure uninterrupted services and leverage the established service networks from the first term, the Government will invite the current operating organisations to consider continuing their services in the sub-districts.""

Miss Mak continued, ""The HYAB has assessed the service coverage and demographic changes in each sub-district and will make appropriate refinements to the service boundaries. Sha Ta (North District), due to its extensive coverage, will be split into two sub-districts to enhance service efficiency. Meanwhile, Sheung Shui Rural (North District) and Hang Hau West (Sai Kung District) will each add a new team in response to continued population growth. In addition, the boundaries of six sub-district clusters will be fine-tuned to better align services with local needs. With these adjustments, the total number of Care Teams will increase from 452 to 455.""

Miss Mak noted, ""The Government expects Care Teams to fully utilise the additional resources to deepen and broaden their services. The Home Affairs Department will work closely with relevant government departments to provide training for Care Team members and volunteers, covering practical skills such as emergency response, communication skills and health support, enabling them to better equip themselves to serve and care for the community.""

District Offices will first invite existing operating organisations to submit proposed project plans for the second term. For the three new sub-districts and any individual teams unable to continue their services for various reasons, District Offices will invite the previously shortlisted organisations to submit proposals. All proposed project plans and related forms must reach the respective District Offices by August 15, 2025 (Friday).

The proposed project plans will be reviewed by the District Assessment and Coordinating Panels on Care Teams led by the District Officers. The results will then be submitted to the Territory-wide Assessment and Steering Group on Care Teams chaired by the SHYA for final approval.
â
As announced by the Chief Executive in the 2024 Policy Address, the Government will regularise Care Teams and increase funding by 50 per cent in the next term of service in support of their work. By the end of the second quarter of 2025, Care Teams have visited about 530 000 elderly households and other households in need, provided about 76 000 times of basic home or other support services, and organised about 38 000 district-level activities. The performance of Care Teams has been witnessed by the community. During emergencies and incidents (including the fire at New Lucky House in Jordan, the massive power cut in Wong Tai Sin, and the emergency water outage in Tung Chung), Care Teams have swiftly mobilised members and volunteers to attend to the needs of affected individuals and provide them with appropriate assistance. Care Teams have also achieved remarkable results in assisting in policy promotion, including collaboration with the Police to promote anti-fraud messages and supporting the Department of Health in disseminating messages about disease prevention."
民政及青年事務局公布地區服務及關愛隊伍第二期服務安排,2025-07-25 15:00,2025-07-25 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500358.htm,"​因應地區服務及關愛隊伍（關愛隊）第一期服務協議將於二○二五年九月底至十月中陸續屆滿，經檢視關愛隊至今的服務成效、資源運用等方面後，民政及青年事務局（民青局）今日（七月二十五日）公布關愛隊的第二期服務安排。

關愛隊自二○二三年第三季全面起動以來，一直按服務協議為各小區市民提供關愛服務。作為政府完善地區治理的重要組成部分，關愛隊與區議會、地區三會共同構建起分工明確、協同高效的「三駕馬車」治理架構。關愛隊通過凝聚社會資源，提供多元化關愛和支援服務，提升市民的獲得感和幸福感，持續加強與區議會及地區三會的協作機制，透過合作協調全面提升服務效能。

民青局局長麥美娟說：「各小區關愛隊至今按關鍵績效指標提供服務的工作已近完成，有小隊更超出指標的要求。在資源運用方面，關愛隊秉持善用社區和政府資源的原則，凝聚社區力量，推動關愛社區的多元化服務和活動。我們有信心全數452隊關愛隊在第一期服務結束時會完成甚或超越關鍵績效指標的服務要求。」

麥美娟稱：「關愛隊在社區已建立堅實的服務基礎，第二期的服務將循三大方向優化：持續無間斷、合區情區需及做更深更廣。為確保服務無縫銜接，並善用在第一期服務下的穩固服務網絡，政府將邀請第一期承辦團體考慮繼續服務，以延續小區服務。」

麥美娟續稱：「民青局已評估各小區的服務範圍與人口變化，將對服務區域進行合適的微調。沙打（北區）由於服務範圍廣大，將其分拆為兩個小區，以提升服務效率；而上水鄉郊（北區）和坑口西（西貢區）則因應人口持續增長，將增設新的服務小隊。此外，有六個小區群將會微調分界讓小隊更貼合區情區需優化服務。根據以上調整，關愛隊總數將由現時452隊增至455隊。」

麥美娟指：「政府要求關愛隊充分利用新增資源加強服務，以期將服務做得更深更廣。民政事務總署會與相關政府部門緊密配合，為關愛隊成員提供各種培訓，涵蓋應急知識、溝通技巧、健康支援等實用技能，好讓關愛隊隊員及義工更好裝備自己，為市民更好關愛送暖。」

各區民政事務處將先邀請現有的承辦團體提交第二期的建議服務計劃書。對於新增的三個小區，以及如果有個別小隊因各種原因無法繼續服務，民政事務處會邀請早前已通過遴選的團體提交建議服務計劃書。所有建議服務計劃書及相關表格須於二○二五年八月十五日（星期五）前提交至相關地區民政事務處。

建議服務計劃書將會提交予民政事務專員領導的地區關愛隊評審及統籌小組評審。評審結果將呈交由民青局局長領導的全港關愛隊評審及督導小組作最後審批。

行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》宣布恆常化關愛隊，並增加下一個資助協議期的資助金額五成，以加強對關愛隊的支援。截至二○二五年第二季尾，關愛隊已合共探訪約530 000個長者戶和其他有需要住戶，提供約76 000次簡單家居或其他支援服務，以及舉辦約38 000項地區活動，成績有目共睹。在發生突發和緊急事故時（包括佐敦華豐大廈大火、黃大仙大規模停電、東涌大規模停水），關愛隊都迅速動員，關心和支援受影響居民。關愛隊在協助政策宣傳方面也取得顯著成效，包括與警方合作宣傳防騙信息，以及配合衞生署發放疾病預防資訊等。"

「綠綠賞」電子積分計劃全面電子化（附圖）,2025-07-25 12:40,2025-07-25 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500344.htm,"環境保護署（環保署）今日（七月二十五日）宣布，隨着科技進步，計劃在二○二六年四月一日把「綠綠賞」電子積分計劃（「綠綠賞」）全面電子化。電子化幫助「綠綠賞」連接市場上更多的獎賞平台，和換領禮品地點。市民將無需前往「綠在區區」換領只有十多種類的禮品，而可透過「綠綠賞」手機應用程式在超過500間超級市場和零售商店兌換市場上任何喜愛或合用的禮品，或免費港鐵車票和本地生態遊。

環保署發言人說：「『綠綠賞』現時約106萬個用戶中，約92萬個用戶，即87%已使用手機應用程式，這些市民可以無縫過渡至全面電子化。為鼓勵仍使用『綠綠賞』實體積分卡的市民盡快轉用手機應用程式，體驗電子化的好處，署方會推出暑期優惠，凡於今年八月一日至九月三十日期間交回積分卡轉用手機應用程式的市民，將可獲得額外50分『綠綠賞』電子積分。」

「綠在區區」所有回收點均會張貼告示，向相關市民公告有關安排。市民亦會有時間適應和過渡至新安排。「綠在區區」將繼續提供實體禮品供兌換至二○二六年第一季，二○二六年四月一日後，實體積分卡才會停止使用。「綠在區區」職員亦會協助有需要的市民安裝手機應用程式及示範如何使用電子積分兌換功能。至於少數沒有智能手機的市民，現有的實體積分卡不會被取消，他們可以在指定的「綠在區區」地點作登記，繼續把實體積分卡的積分換領禮品。

省時方便、更多選擇

「綠在區區」在過去數年最受歡迎的五大禮品為米、油、廁紙、豆奶等生活用品（詳情見附件）。這些廣受歡迎的物品全都可以用「綠綠賞」積分兌換「易賞錢」電子積分，在全港超過500間超級市場和零售商店換取。「綠綠賞」手機應用程式更可兌換港鐵減碳獎賞平台Carbon Wallet積分以換取免費港鐵車票和本地生態遊。

全面電子化後，市民仍可以「綠綠賞」積分捐贈慈善機構，環保署會與相關慈善機構跟進積分兌換電子化後的安排。

電子積分兌換選項自推出以來，反應良好。「易賞錢」兌換功能自二○二四年十二月推出以來，市民每月用於兌換「易賞錢」積分的「綠綠賞」積分，由去年十二月的700萬分增加超過兩倍至今年五月的2400萬分，共有約28,000名用戶使用過「易賞錢」積分兌換功能（詳情見附件）。

電子積分兌換選項現時處於初期試行階段，因此設有兌換積分上限（每個賬戶每月三千分），讓更多用戶可試用新電子兌換選項。環保署正籌劃在今年內引入更多獎賞平台參與積分兌換，為市民提供更多選擇，而現時的每月兌換上限亦會逐步取消。

Carbon Wallet和「易賞錢」的服務合約經公開招標方式批出，服務承辦商在投標時會按各自成本及其他商業考量參與投標和提供報價，服務合約涵蓋積分及其他相關服務（包括宣傳、獎賞平台技術支援、客戶服務等）。

智慧城市、智慧回收

經過環保署多年的努力和市民的支持，「綠綠賞」已由一個積分計劃逐漸發展為一個凝聚不同社會界别共同推動建立綠色減廢回收文化的平台，成功推動市民參與廢物分類回收和培養回收習慣，同時帶動了「綠在區區」的回收量。在二○二四年，「綠在區區」共收集約41800公噸的回收物（不包括廚餘），較二○二三年增加近六成；而二○二五年上半年共收集約22700公噸（不包括廚餘），較去年同期再增加約兩成。（詳情見附件）

發言人說：「今屆政府通過不懈努力，成功扭轉了本港多年來廢物量不斷上升，回收率下降的情況。『綠綠賞』手機應用程式更在二○二四年榮獲Google Play香港『最佳社會貢獻應用程式』大獎。我們期望與所有支持減廢回收的人或機構，一同協力推廣『綠綠賞』，齊心進一步建立香港的綠色減廢回收文化。」"

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

勞工處發布的《預防工作時中暑指引》，詳細說明進行熱壓力風險評估時應考慮的各項風險因素，並針對各風險因素建議相應的控制措施，供僱主和僱員參閱。有關工作暑熱警告及相關指引，請參閱勞工處專題網頁：www.labour.gov.hk/tc/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm。"
LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-25 11:40,2025-07-25 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500348.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."
DH continues to clamp down on illegal waterpipe smoking in no smoking areas (with photos),2025-07-25 11:10,2025-07-25 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500296.htm," The Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the Department of Health (DH) continued to clamp down on illegal waterpipe smoking in no smoking areas by conducting another enforcement operation, codenamed ""Pipepurge"", in Mong Kok last night (July 24) and officers issued a total of 11 fixed penalty notices (FPNs).

 During the operation, officers from TACO (including plainclothes officers) carried out inspections and enforcement action at one bar in Mong Kok, and issued a total of 11 FPNs to persons illegally smoking waterpipes. TACO's investigation is ongoing, and prosecution may also be taken against the operators of the bar who are suspected of aiding and abetting the smoking offences. TACO will also refer the cases to the Liquor Licensing Board for appropriate follow-up action.

 Under the Ordinance, conducting a smoking act in a statutory no smoking area (such as indoor areas of bars or restaurants) is prohibited. Any person engaged in an act of smoking in statutory no smoking areas is liable to a fixed penalty of $1,500. Moreover, where smoking products (including waterpipes) are sold, in bars or otherwise, the restrictions on the promotion and sale of smoking products stipulated in the Ordinance apply. Offenders are liable on summary conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000. Venue managers of statutory no smoking areas are empowered by the Ordinance to request a smoking offender cease the act; if the offender is not co-operative, the manager may contact the Police for assistance.

 In addition, under the Criminal Procedure Ordinance, any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission by another person of any offence shall be guilty of the same offence.

 ""During the inspections conducted from January 2023 to March 2025, the DH issued a total of 305 fixed penalty notices for smoking waterpipe tobacco illegally in indoor no smoking areas, in addition to 170 summonses to the staff of the bar for aiding and abetting smoking in indoor no smoking areas. The DH will continue to closely monitor such activities and take stringent enforcement actions against smoking behaviors such as waterpipe smoking in no smoking areas, as well as the illegal sale and promotion of smoking products,"" said the Head of TACO, Dr Manny Lam.

 Dr Lam reminded the public that waterpipe is a smoking product, and its combustion of fuel (e.g. charcoal) releases carbon monoxide. Exposure to a low concentration of carbon monoxide can lead to a range of symptoms such as dizziness, headache, tiredness and nausea; whereas exposure to a high concentration of carbon monoxide can lead to impaired vision, disturbed co-ordination, unconsciousness, brain damage or even death. People should seek medical attention immediately if they suspect they are developing symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning.

 A typical one-hour waterpipe smoking session exposes the user to 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke inhaled from a single conventional cigarette. Moreover, sharing a waterpipe apparatus increases the risk of transmitting infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis. 

 He cautioned against waterpipe smoking and the use of other smoking products. Smokers should quit smoking as early as possible for their own health and that of others. For more information on the hazards of waterpipe smoking, please visit www.livetobaccofree.hk/pdfs/waterpipe_leaflet_new.pdf."
衞生署繼續嚴厲打擊禁煙區吸食水煙違法活動（附圖）,2025-07-25 11:10,2025-07-25 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500298.htm,"衞生署控煙酒辦公室（控煙酒辦）繼續嚴厲打擊禁煙區非法吸食水煙違法活動，昨晚（七月二十四日）派員到旺角進行代號「菸滅」的行動，共發出11張定額罰款通知書。

行動中，控煙酒辦人員（包括便裝人員）到旺角一間酒吧巡查和執法，向非法吸食水煙的人士發出11張定額罰款通知書。調查仍在進行，控煙酒辦會考慮向涉嫌協助及教唆吸煙罪行的酒吧經營者提出檢控，亦會將個案轉介酒牌局，以作適當跟進。

《條例》禁止任何人於法定禁煙區（例如酒吧或食肆的室內區域）作出吸煙行為。任何人於法定禁煙區作出吸煙行為即屬違法，可被處定額罰款1,500元。另外，如有出售任何吸煙產品（包括水煙），不論是在酒吧或其他處所，須遵守《條例》對推廣和銷售吸煙產品的限制。違例者一經簡易程序定罪，最高可被罰款五萬元。《條例》亦授權法定禁煙區的管理人可要求違例吸煙者停止有關的吸煙行為；如違例者不合作，可要求警方協助。

此外，根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》，任何人協助、教唆、慫使或促致另一人犯任何罪行，即屬就同一罪行有罪。

控煙酒辦主任林民聰醫生說：「衞生署在二○二三年一月至二○二五年三月的巡查期間，就違例在室內禁煙區吸食水煙共發出305張定額罰款通知書，另外也向協助及教唆在室內禁煙區吸煙的酒吧職員發出170張傳票。衞生署會繼續密切監察及持續嚴厲執法，打擊在禁止吸煙區吸食水煙等吸煙行為，以及違法銷售和推廣吸煙產品。」

林民聰醫生提醒市民，水煙是吸煙產品，它所用的助燃物（如煤炭）在燃燒時會產生一氧化碳。曝露於低濃度一氧化碳的人士可能出現頭暈、頭痛、疲倦和噁心等症狀；而曝露於高濃度一氧化碳的人士則可能出現視覺受損、協調紊亂、失去知覺和腦部受損等症狀，甚至死亡。市民如懷疑出現一氧化碳中毒症狀，應立即求醫。

吸食一小時水煙的煙霧吸入量，可達一根傳統捲煙的100至200倍。同時，共用水煙器具會增加水煙使用者感染結核病等傳染病的風險。

他忠告市民，不要吸食水煙或使用其他吸煙產品，並呼籲吸煙人士為個人及他人健康着想，盡快戒煙。更多有關吸食水煙對健康的危害，可參考以下連結：www.livetobaccofree.hk/pdfs/waterpipe_leaflet_new.pdf。"

就上述在逃人士，當中袁弓夷、何良懋、霍嘉誌及蔡明達早前已因涉嫌干犯危害國家安全罪行各被警方懸紅港幣一百萬元通緝；保安局局長亦於二○二四年六月和十二月先後行使《維護國家安全條例》第八十九條所賦予的權力，刊憲指明袁弓夷、霍嘉誌及蔡明達為潛逃者，並指明針對他們而施行的措施。警方會繼續全力將被通緝人士緝拿歸案。

其餘十五名被通緝人士，警方今日各懸紅港幣二十萬元通緝歸案，現呼籲市民就有關上述人士或相關案件提供消息。案件仍在調查中，如有需要，警方會懸紅通緝更多涉案人士。

警方重申：「危害國家安全是非常嚴重的罪行，該類行為或活動可能造成極為嚴重的後果。根據《香港國安法》第三十七條，《香港國安法》適用於在特區以外地方干犯《香港國安法》下罪行的特區永久性居民，及在特區成立的公司及團體等法人及非法人組織。此外，《香港國安法》第三十八條訂明，《香港國安法》亦適用於不具有香港特區永久性居民身份但針對特區實施犯罪的人。因此，香港警方有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌干犯《香港國安法》罪行的人。」

「根據《香港國安法》第三十三條，如犯罪行為人自動放棄繼續犯罪；自動投案，如實供述自己的罪行；或者揭發他人犯罪行為或提供重要線索得以偵破其他案件，可以從輕、減輕處罰。警方呼籲上述被通緝人士要懸崖勒馬，希望他們珍惜機會，回港自首，不要一錯再錯。」

警方亦同時指出，不論以任何形式，包括透過互聯網，任何人協助、教唆、以金錢或者其他財物資助他人參與「香港議會」的相關違法活動或干犯其他危害國家安全罪行，同屬違法行為。警方呼籲社會大眾不要以身試法，警方會對有關犯罪行為嚴正執法。"

A spokesman for the Environment and Ecology Bureau said, ""The Ordinance amends the definition of 'gas' under the Gas Safety Ordinance (Cap. 51) to bring 'regulated hydrogen' used or intended to be used as fuel to propel vehicles, trains, machinery, etc under the regulatory framework of the Gas Safety Ordinance. This Ordinance establishes a regulatory framework governing the importation, manufacture, storage, transport, supply and use of hydrogen that is used or intended to be used as fuel.""

The Ordinance empowers the Chief Executive in Council to make regulations in relation to ""regulated hydrogen"" and its relevant matters. The Government will introduce subsidiary legislation on the regulation of ""regulated hydrogen"" into the Legislative Council for negative vetting within 2026. The Ordinance and the relevant subsidiary legislation will come into effect on the same day. The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department will consult the trade on the proposed subsidiary legislation to ensure that the relevant regulations could effectively assure the safe use of hydrogen in Hong Kong.

The spokesman added, ""The relevant subsidiary legislation will cover the entire supply chain of 'regulated hydrogen' to provide a clear legal framework and stable regulatory environment for the local hydrogen energy industry, enabling both local and international investors to develop hydrogen-related businesses in Hong Kong with greater confidence."""

Scheme of Smart and Green Mass Transit System in Kai Tak gazetted,2025-07-25 09:50,2025-07-25 10:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072400724.htm,"  The Government published in the Gazette today (July 25) the scheme for the Smart and Green Mass Transit System in Kai Tak (SGMTS-KT) in accordance with the Railways Ordinance (Cap. 519).

  The SGMTS-KT is about 3.5 kilometres long with six stations. The termini will be connected to the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal and MTR Kai Tak Station respectively, with intermediate stations at Shing King Street, Kai Tak Sky Garden, Shing Fung Road Park and Kai Tak Sports Park, serving a population and visitors of around 50 000 residing and working in the area.

  A Government spokesman said, ""The SGMTS-KT will connect the former runway area of Kai Tak to the existing MTR Kai Tak Station, strengthening the connectivity among residential and commercial developments as well as tourism, cultural and recreational, sports and community facilities within the area, while connecting with the existing railway network. To be operated in elevated mode and separated from at-grade traffic, the system will not be affected by road traffic conditions. Depending on the system to be adopted eventually, the estimated journey time from the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal to MTR Kai Tak Station will be about 10 minutes.""

  The Government has collected public views on the SGMTS-KT earlier through multiple channels, including consultations with the Kowloon City District Council and the Task Force on Kai Tak Harbourfront Development of the Harbourfront Commission, and exchanging views with relevant Legislative Council Members and stakeholders. It is targeted to award the contract in 2026 with a view to commissioning the system in 2031.

  Under the Railways Ordinance, members of the public may object to the scheme in relation to the SGMTS-KT from today until September 23, 2025. Additionally, any person who has a compensable interest can claim compensation under the provisions of the Ordinance.

  The scheme and relevant plans are viewable on the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) website (www.cedd.gov.hk/eng/our-projects/major-projects/index.html).

Very Hot Weather Warning issued,2025-07-25 06:45,2025-07-25 07:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500140.htm,"Attention TV/radio announcers:

Please broadcast the following as soon as possible:

The Hong Kong Observatory has issued the Very Hot Weather Warning.

To prevent heat stroke, avoid prolonged activities outdoors.

If engaged in outdoor work or activities, wear a wide-brimmed hat and light-coloured, loose-fitting clothes. Stay in shaded areas as much as possible.

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-07-25 06:45,2025-07-25 07:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500142.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (July 25) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

 According to the discussions at yesterday's meeting, the intensified mosquito prevention and control measures by the Government and stakeholders include: constantly updating the list of mosquito infestation hotspots to adjust and plan their work based on the actual situation, to ensure that mosquito prevention and control work is prompt and effective; carrying out a new round of actions promptly following Typhoon Wipha to thoroughly eliminate mosquito breeding places, supplemented by fogging operations (i.e. ultra-low volume spraying) to eradicate adult mosquitoes; continuing to take proactive anti-mosquito measures including clearing potential breeding grounds at least once a week during the rainy season and timely co-ordinate fogging operations until the season ends.

 The FEHD is convening meetings of inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work through its District Environmental Hygiene Offices to strengthen mosquito control work with district stakeholders, including to remove accumulated water and carry out mosquito prevention and control work in target areas that have drawn particular concern, such as public markets, cooked food centres and hawker bazaars, single-block buildings, streets and back lanes, common parts of buildings, village houses, construction sites, vacant sites and road works sites. The FEHD will also call on property managements to properly repairs their premises so as to minimise mosquito breeding places. Furthermore, regular ultra-low volume fogging operations have been conducted since the onset of the rainy season. The FEHD will continue to provide departments and the industry with professional advice and technical support to assist them in formulating and implementing effective anti-mosquito measures swiftly. At the same time, the FEHD will strengthen publicity and public education.

 The survey area inspected today recorded gravidtrap indices reaching Level 3 alert level in May and June this year, indicating extensive distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The FEHD has been collaborating with relevant departments and stakeholders to strengthen mosquito prevention and control work in areas under their purview, including eliminating mosquito breeding places, applying larvicides, conducting fogging operations to eradicate adult mosquitoes, and ensuring that mosquito trapping devices at appropriate locations are operating properly. The first-phase gravidtrap index for this survey area in July has dropped to 5.8 per cent.

 Apart from the co-ordination mechanism at district level, the Environment and Ecology Bureau will also convene a meeting with stakeholders under the regular meeting mechanism for pest control. During the meeting, the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health will present the latest situation of chikungunya fever and responsive measures to be taken by the public. The 15 organisations or institutions participating in this mechanism include the Hong Kong Housing Society, Link, People's Place, the Hong Kong Property Services Alliance, the Hong Kong Association of Property Management Companies, the Federation of Hong Kong Property Management Industry, the Hong Kong Association of Property Services Agents, the Pest Control Personnel Association of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Pest Management Association, the Federation of Hong Kong, Kowloon, New Territories Hawker Associations, the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, the Association for Hong Kong Catering Services Management, the Association of Restaurant Managers, the Hong Kong Construction Association, and the Hong Kong General Building Contractors Association.

 As the hot and rainy weather approaches, the overall risk of mosquito borne diseases may rise significantly. Recently, a considerable number of CF infection cases have been reported in neighbouring regions and some overseas countries. There is also a large number of citizens and tourists frequently travelling to and from Hong Kong and different places. If people infected with CF outside Hong Kong and is bitten by mosquitoes in Hong Kong during the infectious period, and subsequently the mosquitoes bite other people, local transmission may occur. In view of this, although there have been no CF cases in Hong Kong since 2020, the industry and the public must remain vigilant and intensify mosquito prevention and control efforts to avoid the risk of local cases.

 The Government again appeals to members of the public to continue working with us to take early measures to prevent and eliminate mosquitoes at home and other venues early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding places, changing water in vases, scrubbing their inner surfaces, and emptying water fromsaucers under potted plants at least once a week, properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and food containers, and drilling large holes in unused tyres. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management companies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the water accumulation. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergents at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

勞工及福利局局長就《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》、高才通計劃及輸入勞工會見傳媒談話內容,2025-07-24 21:24,2025-07-24 22:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/24/P2025072400876.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（七月二十四日）下午出席保護兒童—《強制舉報者指南》啟動禮後，就《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》、高端人才通行證計劃（高才通計劃）及輸入勞工會見傳媒的談話內容：

勞工及福利局局長：歡迎大家今日來到保護兒童—《強制舉報者指南》啟動禮，剛剛通過較生動形式，正式向所有在法例下有責任作強制舉報的專業人士發布整部《指南》。今次首創以「決策流程圖」及輔助分析框架，透過電子形式回答問題就能得到清晰答案——究竟是否需作出舉報，或在法例下無需舉報但可採取其他行動。

記者：今次為何選用答問形式，是否擔心以往的指南會令業界有困難？有否預計是否所有業界試用過後會認為運作正常？若很多人同時使用平台能否承受？

勞工及福利局局長：今次形式屬首創。在草擬《強制舉報虐待兒童條例草案》時，《指南》是大家其中一個關注點，專業人士對何時須按法例要求作強制舉報有擔憂。同事花了不少心力，既製作《指南》，亦透過電子模式以簡單易明的方法將《指南》放到網站，讓每位懷疑出現個案的專業人士回答一連串問題就可得到清晰答案。這做法的好處是確保舉報的一致性，讓業界有更大信心可以完整地按法例要求履行法定責任。

記者：早前副局長說過若按照《指南》指示不作舉報，在法庭可作辯護理由，但同時《指南》明確表示只作補充作用，不能取代專業判斷。局長會否建議所有舉報者一直根據這《指南》行事，而非以專業判斷凌駕《指南》決定？

勞工及福利局局長：當然最終責任要按法例要求，但《指南》乃參考法例而制定，把法例要求舉報的較抽象及高層次要求落實到現實場景中。我們提到專業人士在完成電子流程後如有需要打印一份，正是希望讓大家安心已按《指南》要求完成整個「決策流程圖」。若流程圖顯示按當時情景在法例下不需作強制舉報，將來有需要時可以呈交，他們便能放心。

記者：想問高才通方面，昨日入境處公布拘捕一犯罪集團，並表示有22宗成功申請高才通的個案使用虛假學歷，為何他們會獲批？是否機制有問題？

勞工及福利局局長：昨日入境事務處舉行記者會，詳細講述發現不法分子通過犯法途徑，使不符合要求的人士在高才通計劃下取得資格。我們現正按法例嚴正追究其責任，這些人士皆須負上刑事責任。我希望藉此機會再次傳遞信息——政府對所有人才入境計劃均會嚴格把關。大家亦留意到，自去年年中開始，每宗高才通計劃下B類及C類的申請，均須提交由指定第三方認證機構或頒授院校就其學歷發出的認證文件。現時我們發現的案例，均是在去年中前、即未實行優化措施前發生，我們定會嚴正跟進。此外，所有未曾作第三方驗證的高才通計劃下B類及C類的續簽個案申請，均需進行第三方驗證，可見我們非常認真、嚴肅確保人才入境計劃下接收的所有申請，包括續簽申請均嚴格、完整符合要求。

記者：局長你好，《指南》現已推出，下一步行動會否是訂立「沒有保護罪」？很多業界認為單靠現時的虐兒條例不足以保護兒童，會否承諾在今個任期內實行「沒有保護罪」呢？

勞工及福利局局長：今日是發布《指南》，在接下來的半年，我們會在三個廣大的界別——社福界、教育界及醫療衞生界作廣泛培訓，令數以萬計有法律責任的專業人士均熟悉《指南》及熟悉電子平台的運作模式。由明年一月二十日開始，即《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》正式生效後，我們最主要任務是使其成功落實。這是新條例，環顧其他地方的經驗均需要時間。除舉報外，在預防工作方面、或一旦出現強制舉報個案後如何承托及跟進有關個案並為有關兒童提供協助，及處理與有關家庭相關的所有議題等，均需投入大量精力、時間及資源。此刻我仍然覺得主要精力應放在有新《條例》下，切實做好強制舉報虐兒有關的工作。

記者：前幾天有行會成員表示，關於失業率問題，是由於外勞不足，你會怎樣回應？有否了解相關情況？

勞工及福利局局長：當前情況是香港勞動人口的峰值已過，香港面對的大趨勢是勞動人口漸漸減少，且出現老齡化挑戰。在這大環境下，不論是政府推出的三個行業輸入勞工計劃或「補充勞工優化計劃」，均是希望確保在本地工人優先就業的大前提下，令我們的經濟及業界還有發展空間，惟前設是確保本地工人優先就業。以「補充勞工優化計劃」為例，必須先進行四星期本地招聘，確保若出現空缺時須先招聘本地工人，若過後仍有空缺，勞工處才會因應情況考慮批出一定配額予有關僱主聘請輸入勞工。目的正是在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，令企業有發展空間，因此整個計劃的設計是希望按照這大原則進行。

記者：有說飲食業失業率有水分，你會如何回應？

勞工及福利局局長：有數個業界的情況大家特別關心，例如最近的飲食界。飲食界輸入的勞工均需經過上述流程，即每宗申請均須先進行四星期本地招聘，在無法聘請足夠本地勞工的情況下，若我們認為其符合所有要求，經過勞工顧問委員會後方會作批出配額的決定。大家要明白所有輸入勞工的工資不得少於香港相關工種的中位工資，換言之輸入勞工不會減低僱主聘請員工的支出，因為他們須付中位工資，亦需負責輸入勞工在港住宿費用。然而，對個別企業而言，若無法聘請足夠本地人手，需靠輸入勞工補足勞動缺口。我們必定就包括飲食界在內的每宗申請，嚴肅、嚴正確保做到大要求，即先確保本地工人優先就業。多謝大家。

Response from the Environment and Ecology Bureau on judicial review judgment on transgender people using FEHD public toilets,2025-07-24 21:03,2025-07-24 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/24/P2025072400868.htm,"âA spokesperson for the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) stated that regarding the judgment handed down by the Court of First Instance yesterday (July 23) on the judicial review concerning the provisions related to segregation of the sexes under the Public Conveniences (Conduct and Behaviour) Regulation (Cap. 132BL), the Government is carefully studying the judgment and seeking legal advice, and is considering lodging an appeal. At present, members of the public must continue to enter public toilets according to the principle of segregation of the sexes to avoid contravening the relevant laws.

The spokesperson for the EEB said, ""The establishment of sex-segregated public toilets under the Public Conveniences (Conduct and Behaviour) Regulation aims to protect the privacy and safety of the public when using public toilets, and to reflect social norms and expectations. This arrangement has been widely accepted by society.""

Currently, public toilets under the purview of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) are categorised into sex-segregated public toilets and gender neutral public toilets. Sex-segregated toilets follow the segregation of the sexes under the Public Conveniences (Conduct and Behaviour) Regulation. At the same time, gender-neutral toilets are available near about half of all sex-segregated toilets , including ""Accessible Toilets"" or ""Unisex Toilets"", which are available for use by all members of the public, including transgender individuals.

In this judicial review, the Court of First Instance ordered that the provisions related to segregation of the sexes under the Public Conveniences (Conduct and Behaviour) Regulation shall be struck down, and suspended the execution of the order for 12 months to allow the Government time to address the matter of transgender individuals with gender identity disorder using FEHD public toilets. As indicated above, the Government is carefully studying the judgment and seeking legal advice, and is considering lodging an appeal."

WFSFAA and Police jointly combat fraudulent acts by those seeking to obtain Working Family Allowance illegally,2025-07-24 20:30,2025-07-24 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/24/P2025072400708.htm,"  A spokesman for the Working Family and Student Financial Assistance Agency (WFSFAA) said today (July 24) that the WFSFAA and the Police had recently conducted a joint operation to combat fraudulent acts by those seeking to obtain the Working Family Allowance (WFA) illegally. The Police have arrested a total of six people for allegedly defrauding or intending to defraud the WFSFAA, involving an amount of about $30,000.

  The Working Family Allowance Office of the WFSFAA, when processing WFA applications in April this year, detected suspicious documentary proof relating to employment and income submitted by some applicants. The WFSFAA swiftly reported the incident to the Police and referred the cases suspected of using false documents to the Police for investigation. After a thorough investigation, the Police carried out an operation recently and have arrested a total of six people so far for allegedly defrauding or intending to defraud the WFSFAA. The WFSFAA will continue to render full assistance to the Police in the investigation and recover the overpaid allowances from the relevant persons as appropriate in a timely manner.

  The spokesman said that the WFSFAA scrutinises every WFA application in a stringent manner and has established a mechanism to identify and guard against fraud cases. When detecting unlawful acts such as false information, fraudulence or other criminal elements in WFA applications, the WFSFAA will take appropriate follow-up actions, including referring any such suspected cases to the law enforcement agencies. The cases were discovered by the WFSFAA after identifying suspicious applications in the process of vetting applications. The WFSFAA will continue to examine WFA applications in a stringent manner to ensure the proper use of public funds. Members of the public are urged not to defraud the WFSFAA.

  The WFA Scheme aims to support low-income working households, which are not receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance, by promoting full-time employment and self-reliance, as well as rewarding hard work. Applicants are required to submit documentary proof of working hours, income and assets to the WFSFAA for assessing their eligibility for the WFA. Every applicant for the WFA is required to sign a declaration in the application form to declare that the information provided, and the documentary proof submitted, are true, complete and accurate. The WFSFAA has also clearly stated in the application form that obtaining the WFA by deception is a criminal offence. In addition to being disqualified for the WFA, the applicant may also be prosecuted and liable on conviction to imprisonment for a maximum of 14 years under the Theft Ordinance (Cap 210)."

環境及生態局發言人說：「根據《公廁（行為及舉止）規例》設立遵行男女分隔原則的公廁，目的是為了保障市民的私隱和使用公廁時的安全，以及反映社會的規範和期望，此安排一直獲社會廣泛接受。」

現時，食物環境衞生署（食環署）轄下公廁分為男女分隔公廁和無分性別公廁。男女分隔公廁根據《公廁（行為及舉止）規例》遵行男女分隔原則執行分隔規定。同時，目前達總數約一半的男女分隔公廁附近設有無分性別公廁，包括「暢通易達洗手間」或「通用洗手間」，以供各界人士（包括跨性別人士）使用。

 就是次司法覆核，原訟法庭裁決《公廁（行為及舉止）規例》下與男女分隔相關條文須予以撤銷，並暫緩執行該命令12個月，讓政府處理患有性別認同障礙的跨性別人士使用食環署公廁的事宜。如上文所述，政府正仔細研究判詞和徵詢法律意見，考慮提出上訴。"

Remarks by SLW on Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance,2025-07-24 19:58,2025-07-24 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/24/P2025072400830.htm,"  Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, on Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance after attending Child Protection - Launching Ceremony of the Guide for Mandated Reporters this afternoon (July 24):

Reporter: How will this Ordinance change the way child abuse cases are handled in Hong Kong? What is included in the new guide and how will it help professionals on the ground? Will there be any kind of training or support that mandated reporters will receive to ensure they can identify and report child abuse correctly?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: The aim of the Guide for Mandated Reporters is to provide a practical guideline to help all the professionals under the law who have the legal obligations to report child abuse cases. Apart from the usual practice of publishing a guideline covering all the requirements and setting out all the scenarios, this time around we have also decided to create an electronic version which the professionals concerned could click onto the website and by answering a series of questions, they will be led to a conclusion under the system telling them whether or not the case concerned is one that he or she has to report under the law, or one that is not required under the law to make a report. The purpose is to help all the professionals to discharge their legal obligations under the law. "
勞工及福利局局長主持保護兒童--《強制舉報者指南》啟動禮（附圖）,2025-07-24 19:50,2025-07-24 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/24/P2025072400474.htm,"勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（七月二十四日）主持保護兒童—《強制舉報者指南》（《指南》）啟動禮，宣布供強制舉報者參考的《指南》正式推出。

《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》（《條例》）將於二○二六年一月二十日起實施，規定包括社會福利、教育及醫療衞生界的25類指明專業人員必須舉報嚴重虐兒個案，藉以為兒童編織全面而有效的保護網。為此，政府於去年初在上述三個界別分別成立專業顧問團，以制訂《指南》，協助強制舉報者掌握保護兒童的原則，並識別強制舉報機制下必須舉報的個案。

孫玉菡於啟動禮上致辭時表示，三個專業顧問團匯聚跨專業界別的代表，彼此交流專業意見，協助敲定不同情境下強制舉報者考慮舉報時應參考的關鍵因素，成為《指南》「決策流程圖」的重要基礎，進一步協助強制舉報者作出舉報決定，是強制舉報者的實用參考。

他指出，社會福利署（社署）亦為「決策流程圖」開發電子輔助系統，通過簡單問答，便可協助強制舉報者快捷和方便地分析個案情況，當中有需要強制舉報的個案更會自動轉至舉報平台，讓強制舉報者可盡快作出舉報。

典禮上，孫玉菡在勞工及福利局常任秘書長劉焱和社署署長杜永恒的陪同下，聯同立法會福利事務委員會主席管浩鳴、醫務衞生局副秘書長麥子濘、警務處助理處長（刑事）鍾詠敏和署理教育局首席助理秘書長（特殊教育）陳潔玲，一同主持啟動儀式。

啟動禮介紹了《指南》的特色，並展示稍後推出的電子版「決策流程圖」的運作流程。三位分別來自位社會福利界、教育界及醫療衞生界的專業顧問團成員更分享參與制定《指南》的感受。他們讚許《指南》是跨專業協作推動保護兒童工作的成功例子。於制定《指南》的過程中，專業顧問團討論從業界收集得來的650個案情境和問題，舉行33次聚焦小組會議，共有540名前線專業人員出席，他們的寶貴意見成為專業顧問團的重要參考，協助敲定《指南》細節。

杜永恒表示，保護兒童一直有賴多專業合作，《指南》結合不同專業的本地經驗、實務智慧和專業知識，象徵保護兒童工作的新里程，更進一步凝聚不同專業的力量。

政府下星期起會為指明專業人員陸續推出網上學習課程《單元二》，內容涵蓋與《條例》相關的法律和舉報事宜的基本知識，包括《條例》的主要內容、《指南》的簡介、常見情境的分析、舉報流程，以及舉報後的跟進行動。"
SLW officiates at Child Protection - Launching Ceremony of Guide for Mandated Reporters (with photos),2025-07-24 19:50,2025-07-24 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/24/P2025072400477.htm,"The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, officiated at Child Protection - Launching Ceremony of the Guide for Mandated Reporters today (July 24) to announce the official launch of the Guide for mandated reporters' reference.

The Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance, which mandates 25 categories of specified professionals from the social welfare sector, education sector and healthcare sector to report serious child abuse cases, will commence on January 20, 2026, to create a wide and effective protection web for children. As such, the Government formed three professional consultative panels in each of the aforementioned sectors in early 2024 for formulating the Guide, which aims to assist mandated reporters in mastering child protection principles and identifying cases to be reported under the mandatory reporting regime.

Addressing the ceremony, Mr Sun said that the three professional consultative panels comprise cross-disciplinary professionals. Their professional exchanges on different cases not only have assisted in establishing a list of key factors that mandated reporters should take into consideration before deciding whether a report is necessary under different scenarios, but also laid an important foundation for the decision trees in the Guide, which further helps mandated reporters make reporting decisions and serves as a practical reference for mandated reporters.

He said that an electronic system of the decision trees has also been specially developed by the Social Welfare Department to assist mandated reporters in making an analysis of the case scenarios in a swift and convenient manner only by answering simple questions. The electronic system will also direct those cases that need mandatory reporting to the reporting page to ensure mandated reporters can make a report as soon as practicable.

At the ceremony, Mr Sun, accompanied by the Permanent Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Ms Alice Lau, and the Director of Social Welfare, Mr Edward To, officiated the launch of the Guide with the Chairman of the Legislative Council Panel on Welfare Services, ReverendCanon Peter Douglas Koon; Deputy Secretary for Health Ms Elaine Mak; the Assistant Commissioner of Police (Crime), Ms Chung Wing-man; and the Acting Principal Assistant Secretary (Special Education) of the Education Bureau, Ms Candy Chan.

The features of the Guide were introduced at the ceremony. A demonstration of the workflow of the electronic version of the decision trees to be rolled out was also featured. Three representatives from the professional consultative panels of the social welfare sector, education sector and healthcare sector shared their feelings about their participation in formulating the Guide. They commended the Guide as a successful example of cross-disciplinary efforts in promoting child protection. While formulating the Guide, the professional consultative panels discussed 650 case scenarios and questions collected from their sectors in 33 focus group meetings. The valuable advice gathered from the 540 frontline professionals participating in these focus group meetings became a helpful and important reference for the professional consultative panels to finalise the details of the Guide.

Mr To said that cross-disciplinary collaboration has long been indispensable to child protection. The Guide, which is a combination of local experience, practical wisdom and professional knowledge, not only symbolises a new milestone in child protection efforts, but also further promotes synergy across different disciplines.

The Government will roll out Module 2 of the online learning course for specified professionals in phases starting from next week, covering basic knowledge on the legal and reporting matters related to the Ordinance, including the key content of the Ordinance, a brief introduction to the Guide, analysis of common scenarios, reporting procedures, and post-reporting follow-up."
HKMoA to stage first exhibition of Chinese art master Wu Guanzhong in Korea (with photos),2025-07-24 19:25,2025-07-24 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/24/P2025072300612.htm,"  The Hong Kong Museum of Art (HKMoA) will stage the exhibition ""Wu Guanzhong Art Sponsorship Overseas Exhibition Series: Wu Guanzhong: Between Black and White"" in the Seoul Calligraphy Art Museum of the Seoul Arts Center (SAC), starting from tomorrow (July 25) to October 19. Wu (1919-2010) was a master of the Chinese and international art scene who was widely regarded as one of the most influential Chinese art figures in the 20th century. This is the HKMoA's first exhibition in Korea, featuring 17 iconic pieces of Wu's ink and oil paintings in Korea, also for the first time, all selected from the HKMoA's collection. The exhibition is a pre-festival programme of Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul (HK Week@Seoul). Admission is free.
  
  The exhibition is presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) and jointly organised by the SAC and the HKMoA. The exhibition is made possible by the Wu Guanzhong Art Sponsorship. This exhibition in Seoul is a continuation of the popular thematic exhibition of Wu, held at the HKMoA from March 2024 to March 2025, which achieved great success and attracted more than 570 000 visitors during the exhibition period. Accompanied by insightful excerpts from the artist's writings, the exhibition allows visitors to explore the art master's distinctive chromatic aesthetics as well as the countless passions and flights of imagination evoked from the interplay between black and white. There will be opportunities to appreciate iconic paintings such as ""Two Swallows"", ""Reminiscences of Jiangnan"", ""Waterway"" and more.
  
  Wu's works perfectly fuse Eastern and Western aesthetics. He dedicated his entire life to exploring the integration of Chinese and Western art, studied traditional Chinese ink painting and also ventured into the colourful world of oil painting in his early years. After studying in France, he returned to China. His works are noted for his masterful integration of the emotional depth of traditional Chinese ink painting with Western modernist and abstract composition. In 1992, Wu was among the first living Chinese artists to be honoured with a solo exhibition at the British Museum, and his works are also widely exhibited in Asia, Europe and the United States.
  
  Wu had deep connections with Hong Kong, and held multiple exhibitions and participated in various art events in the city. Over the years, Wu and his family have continuously made donations of Wu's works and archives to the HKMoA, making up a substantial collection of over 450 items. The HKMoA has become the institution with the largest and most diverse collection of Wu's works. With the support of the Wu Guanzhong Art Sponsorship, the HKMoA is bringing the museum collection and the research and curatorial insights of the art of Wu overseas, and will continue to promote Wu and modern Chinese art to audiences in different regions and at various levels through comprehensive and diversified perspectives.
  
  In addition, an immersive installation from the ""Wu Guanzhong Art Sponsorship Cross-disciplinary Series: Wu Guanzhong x Chris Cheung"" will also be on display overseas for the first time, complementing the exhibition. Processed by AI, ""Sentient Pond - Seoul Edition"" created by Hong Kong artist Chris Cheung generates exclusive paintings by visitors that embody Wu's brushstrokes and artistic style through machine learning over hundreds of Wu's paintings from the museum collection, to carry on the unconventional creations and spirit of Wu with a contemporary twist.
  
  Hong Kong Week is an annual arts festival organised by the LCSD, celebrating Hong Kong's creative excellence worldwide and fostering cultural exchanges and artistic collaboration. This year, the festival will arrive in Seoul for the first time. Beginning on September 26, a total of 14 programmes will feature stage performances, film screenings, outdoor shows, visual art exhibitions, comic creations, fashion designs as well as other fringe activities.

香港藝術館首度在韓國舉辦中國畫壇巨匠吳冠中作品展（附圖）,2025-07-24 19:25,2025-07-24 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/24/P2025072300584.htm,"香港藝術館明日（七月二十五日）至十月十九日在韓國藝術殿堂的首爾書法博物館，舉辦「吳冠中藝術贊助境外展覽系列：吳冠中——黑．白．灰」展覽。享譽中外畫壇的吳冠中（一九一九年至二○一○年），是公認二十世紀最具影響力的藝術家之一。是次展覽是香港藝術館首個在韓國舉行的展覽，從館藏中精選十七件吳冠中水墨和油畫作品首次在韓國展出。此展覽為「香港周2025@首爾」（首爾香港周）的前奏節目，免費入場。

是次首爾展覽由康樂及文化事務署（康文署）主辦，藝術殿堂和香港藝術館聯合籌劃，並蒙「吳冠中藝術贊助」專項基金贊助。早前在香港藝術館舉辦的吳冠中藝術贊助專題展覽系列廣獲好評，於二○二四年三月至二○二五年三月展出期間，吸引逾五十七萬人次到場參觀。在首爾舉辦的展覽將延續展示吳冠中獨特的色彩美學，配合藝術家的語錄選段，讓觀眾在大師級經典作品包括《雙燕》、《憶江南》及《水巷》等之中，體驗黑白之間引發的無限激情與想像。

吳冠中的作品完美融合東方與西方美學，他一生探索中西融和的藝術，早年研習水墨國畫又踏足彩色的油畫世界，留學法國進修後返回中國，傳統水墨的細膩情感與西方現代主義和抽象構圖在他的作品中渾然成一。一九九二年，吳冠中成為首位在大英博物館舉辦個人展覽的在世中國藝術家，歷年來其作品亦在亞洲、歐洲及美國多地公開展覽。

吳冠中與香港淵源甚深，曾先後多次踏足香港舉辦畫展及參加活動廣結藝緣。多年來，承蒙吳冠中和家人慷慨捐贈大師作品及個人文獻，香港藝術館累計藏品數目超過四百五十件，是全球擁有吳冠中作品最多、最豐富的藝術機構。在「吳冠中藝術贊助」的支持下，藝術館把館藏吳冠中作品及其研究和策展成果帶出香港，未來將繼續全方位多角度推廣吳冠中及中國近現代藝術至不同地域及層面的觀眾。 

同時，「吳冠中藝術贊助跨界系列：吳冠中 x 張瀚謙」亦首次移師海外。由香港藝術家張瀚謙創作的沉浸式藝術裝置《若水——首爾篇》，結合人工智能技術，將觀眾即席揮毫的筆觸，融匯香港藝術館館藏的數百幅吳冠中作品，以當代思維延續吳冠中的創新意念。

由康文署主辦的「香港周」是一場年度國際藝術盛事，今年首次登陸首爾，展現香港卓越的創意力量，促進文化交流，加強香港與世界各地的藝術家的合作。「香港周」將於九月二十六日隆重開幕，呈獻十四項精彩節目，涵蓋舞台表演、電影放映、戶外演出、視覺藝術展、動漫展、時裝展及其他活動。

有關展覽及「首爾香港周」詳情，請瀏覽香港藝術館網頁 hk.art.museum/tc/web/ma/exhibitions-and-events/overseas-wgz-bnw.html及「香港周」網頁www.hongkongweek.gov.hk。"
立法會：醫務衞生局副局長就「關注中產養老需求，構建高質量康養生態體系」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-07-24 19:24,2025-07-24 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/24/P2025072400749.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局（醫衞局）副局長范婉雯醫生今日（七月二十四日）在立法會會議上就陳沛良議員動議的「關注中產養老需求，構建高質量康養生態體系」議案的總結發言：

代主席：

多謝各位議員剛才的發言，關注中產人士養老需求。為應對香港人口老化的挑戰，政府積極推進醫療改革，我會總結政府在長者醫療服務方面所推行的政策和工作。

醫療改革的其中一個重點，是積極發展基層醫療服務。其中，「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」透過私營家庭醫生和地區康健服務，以共付模式提供慢性疾病篩查及管理服務，讓較有經濟能力和可以共同承擔的市民可便捷地獲取這些服務，達致「早預防、早發現、早治療」。計劃自推出至今已經有超過14萬名市民參加。我們會繼續強化和推進「一人一家庭醫生」制度。

另外，不少中產人士亦會購買醫療保險，以應付醫療開支。政府於二○一九年四月起全面推行自願醫保計劃，提供一種受特定規範、市場透明度高的個人償款住院保險產品。自願醫保認可產品不論受保人的健康狀況有否改變，均保證續保至100歲，所以調整保費時同一產品內相同年齡和性別群組須一視同仁，不可向個別投保人收取差別對待保費。這些安排希望可讓市民更有信心購買醫療保險。

政府在二○二四年推行「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」，今年擴展至大灣區九個內地城市全覆蓋。現時可以使用醫療券的服務點已增加至15個，並於今年內增加至21個，可更有效地為在粵港澳大灣區養老的香港長者的醫療需要提供支援。

在加強跨境醫療支援方面，政府於二○二四年底推出為期一年的「大灣區跨境直通救護車試行計劃」，經（指定跨境合作醫院團隊）評估及同意，以點對點模式於指定醫院之間，直接將病人送抵香港。

另外，中產長者雖然有一定的經濟能力，但如若患上重病，我們擔心有關醫療費用可能對他們帶來沉重負擔。政府推出的公營醫療收費改革，將會加強醫療安全網，引入不用經濟審查的每年一萬元住院及門診費用上限，令突發重病患者或長期病患，不會需要負擔沉重的醫療費用。我們亦會推動引入更多先進創新藥械，加快自費藥物醫療器械進入安全網並放寬申請資格，令更多人士可以得到更高比例的資助，避免因病致貧。

此外，市民可以透過醫健通流動應用程式管理個人健康並掌握健康資訊，如電子健康紀錄、醫療券餘額查詢等，亦包括「跨境健康紀錄」功能。

政府於二○二二年推出《基層醫療健康藍圖》，將焦點由治療轉向至預防疾病，我們會推動建立一個可持續的醫療系統。醫衞局會繼續這方面的工作，協助市民提升自我健康管理能力，長遠促進全民健康老齡化。

多謝代主席。我謹此陳辭。"
勞工及福利局局長為保護兒童--《強制舉報者指南》啟動禮主禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-07-24 19:15,2025-07-24 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/24/P2025072400776.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局（勞福局）局長孫玉菡今日（七月二十四日）下午為保護兒童—《強制舉報者指南》啟動禮主禮的致辭內容：

管牧師（立法會福利事務委員會主席管浩鳴）、常秘（勞福局常任秘書長劉焱）、署長（社會福利署署長杜永恒）；局方、署方、各政府部門的好朋友；社會福利界、教育界及醫療衞生界的好朋友：

終於來到我們「三步驟」的第二步。我說的所謂「三步驟」，第一步是我們去年七月份通過了《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》，過了第一關。《條例》通過後最大的挑戰，就是製作這個《強制舉報者指南》 。當時大家十分緊張，如何將《條例》的一些比較寬闊的要求，轉換成落地、實質的《指南》，這是大家最關心的。經過一年努力，今日終於揭盅。其實大家都知道的，稍後同事亦會作出示範。《指南》得以順利製成，加上開發了名字很亮麗的「決策流程圖」及「輔助分析框架」的電子輔助系統，至少在以中文為主要語言的世界中，是首創的。這次首創，最重要的是體現了三個業界：社會福利界、教育界、醫療衞生界──排名不分先後，因為我是社福界別，所以我把社會福利界放在前面，事實上三個界別都是均等的──三個業界的所有專家學者及所有前線的同工，齊心合力聚集所有智慧及過去的經驗和知識，全部匯集在稍後同事會示範的「決策流程圖」中。簡單來說，通過這個系統的問答，所有大家認為很複雜、像電話簿般厚的一本《指南》所有的內容，都得以簡單消化。填寫答案後，系統均能夠清晰告訴大家每個個案是否屬《條例》下需要強制舉報的個案。若然不是，亦不代表無須作出跟進，只是首先解決了法律下的專業責任。這個我覺得大家必須安心的。

在這裏，我亦分享一下心路歷程。事實上能做到這件事，我們一年前構想的時候，是覺得遙不可及的。一年前構想時，我們預想，如果能做到一份《指南》、有清晰的指引，已是莫大的成就。但是香港精神是不能被低估的，我們不滿足於純粹製作一個傳統式的紙本──雖是有的──但我們更希望幫助到所有業界。因為在立法過程中，我們深刻體會到所有業界都十分支持，很想做好這個工作，保護我們的兒童、保護我們的弱勢社群。但是無可否認，如何準確地做到法律的要求，是一個很大的挑戰。縱使我們有大量的培訓、有《指南》，以及滿足了所有要求，大家的心都是忐忑的。於是，便引發了很多疑慮，包括會不會寧願舉報多一點，或者他們的舉報內容是否一致。所以，今日的電子版問答形式能讓大家可以做到這個決定，是一個突破性的安排。我們投入的時間、精力及工夫非常多，同事都是加班及全心投入的，但我相信同事都認同，它的效益是很巨大的。因為它能夠讓所有需要作強制舉報的專業人士鬆一口氣，而且系統非常準確。無論有任何改變，只要調校了裏面的系統，全部人都可一致應用，其效益是巨大無比的。這亦顯示了，即使是社會福利、教育、醫療衞生界的強制舉報事宜，我們都可以創意地運用科技。科技賦能，讓我們做得更好。

在這裏，我再次衷心感謝所有在制定《條例》及《指南》過程中付出心力的所有朋友。為數之多，我未必能一一致謝。同時，我亦要感謝數以萬計的專業人士，同樣為這事付出非常多心力。

我們非常相信，隨着《條例》在明年一月份正式實施，所有兒童會獲得多一份保護。我們更希望，不是在發生了事故後才去跟進，仍然堅信「預防勝於治療」。我相信大家會盡一切努力，固然最好是不需要舉報，但若然萬一發生了不幸事件，有強制舉報機制，我們能早一天干預，早一天救回一個小朋友，換來美好的明天。

謝謝大家。"
