立法會：環境及生態局局長在全體委員會審議階段就《2025年建築物能源效益（修訂）條例草案》各項條文及修正案合併辯論的發言全文（只有中文）,2025-06-11 15:46,2025-06-11 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100658.htm,"以下是環境及生態局局長謝展寰今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議全體委員會審議階段就《2025年建築物能源效益（修訂）條例草案》各項條文及修正案合併辯論的發言全文：

主席：

我現在提出七項政府修正案，修正《2025年建築物能源效益（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）第3、6、16、17和19條，以及新增第7A條。修正案內容已載列於早前由立法會秘書處發送予各位議員的文件內。七項修正案按內容大致可歸納為三組，我現作扼要介紹：

（一）「數據中心」的定義

第一組修正案旨在優化《條例草案》中「數據中心」的定義。我們建議修改《條例草案》第3條，說明「數據中心」的定義為「主要為提供數據儲存、數據處理及分發服務而在安全及受控制的環境放置和操作電腦系統、伺服器、電訊設備及相關支援組件的地方」，並於附註中列出相關支援組件的例子。經修正後的定義説明了「數據中心」應該包含的元素，並排除了純粹用作貯存有關設備的地方和只存放上述任何一種設備的地方。

（二）指明建築物擁有人及／或相關政府部門首長在豁免進行能源審核的條件不再適用時須予跟進的事項

第二組修正案的目的，是指明建築物擁有人及／或相關政府部門首長在豁免進行能源審核的條件不再適用時須予跟進的事項。《條例草案》第6條設有條款，容許機電署（機電工程署）署長應政府某部門首長的書面意見，以維護國家安全為由豁免建築物進行能源審核。因應法律顧問和法案委員會就豁免實際操作提出的意見，政府全盤檢視了《條例》第4部的現有和擬議新增豁免進行能源審核的條款，並建議在《條例草案》新增第7A條，闡述相關要求，包括：

（a）相關擁有人及／或政府部門首長須向機電署署長送交書面通知；

（b）在豁免條件不再適用後的12個月內，相關擁有人須安排就該建築物的中央屋宇裝備裝置進行能源審核；

（c）機電署署長可應擁有人的書面申請延長進行能源審核的期限；以及

（d）違反這項能源審核規定的罪行和適用罰則。

（三）技術性及草擬行文修訂

最後一組修正案屬於技術和草擬行文修訂。首先是刪除《條例草案》第6條中就「國家安全」定義的提述。根據律政司的最新法律意見，「國家安全」一詞的涵義已在《釋義及通則條例》（第1章）第3條中界定，該詞的涵義與《條例草案》中的提述相同，因此無需重覆界定。這項技術修訂對《條例草案》和經修訂《建築物能源效益條例》（《條例》）的法律效力並無影響。

其次是《條例草案》第16和17條關於「社區建築物用途而佔用的建築物」和「市政建築物用途而佔用的建築物」的雙語表述。因應法案委員會的建議，政府將提出行文修訂，使這些詞彙的文意更暢達易明。

最後，政府建議就《條例草案》第19條作相應技術修訂，以配合對第3條中「數據中心」的定義。

法案委員會對上述七項修正案並無異議，我懇請各委員支持及通過修正案。"

主席：

《2025年建築物能源效益（修訂）條例草案》今日得以恢復二讀辯論，我衷心感謝法案委員會主席盧偉國議員的領導、委員會其他議員的支持，以及立法會秘書處的努力，讓《條例草案》的審議工作得以高效、順利進行。我亦十分感謝剛才發言的14位議員提出的意見及大家對《條例草案》的支持。

修例目的

《條例草案》的主要目的，是加強本港建築物的能源效益管理制度。目前，香港約90%電力用於建築物，超過50%的碳排放來自與建築物耗能相關的電力生產。因此，提高建築物能源效益對達致節能減碳的目的十分重要。目前，《建築物能源效益條例》（第610章）（《條例》）已規管建築物在新建或進行主要裝修工程時，其屋宇裝備裝置必須符合訂明的能源效益標準，而商業建築物亦須每隔不多於10年進行一次能源審核，從而發掘和落實節能機會。

《條例》由二○一二年九月實施至今，已有超過2 300幢新建建築物和超過15 000項現有建築物的主要裝修工程符合能源效益標準，另有約2 700幢建築物完成首次能源審核，其中超過一半更已完成第二次能源審核。

《條例草案》的主要建議

參考《條例》的執行經驗，政府建議循以下五個範疇修訂《條例》，進一步提升本港建築物能源效益：

（一）把數據中心全面納入建築物能源效益標準的規管範圍：目前《條例》已規管位於商業樓宇內數據中心的能源效益標準，但尚未覆蓋獨棟數據中心和由工業大廈部分改建的數據中心。考慮到這些數據中心的用電量甚高，且將會有越來越多數據中心落成，我們將獨棟數據中心和由工業大廈部分改建的數據中心的新建和主要裝修工程納入建築物能源效益標準的規管範圍，即把《條例》相關部分所涵蓋的建築物類型由13類增加至15類；

（二）要求更多類型的建築物定期進行能源審核：根據機電工程署就已進行第二次能源審核建築物的數據，這些建築物的能源使用指數平均較首次能源審核時下降了20%，顯示能源審核有助促進建築物節能。因此，我們要求更多類別的建築物定期進行能源審核，包括用作政府辦公室、教育、社區、市政、醫療及健康護理服務等用途的建築物，即是將《條例》要求須定期進行能源審核的建築物類型由兩類增加至11類。

另一方面，因應在諮詢期內所收到的意見，我們建議除數據中心外，豁免總樓面面積不超過7 000平方米（即約75 000呎）的中小型建築物進行能源審核，以平衡經濟效益和規管目的；

（三）將能源審核的周期由現時的10年縮短至五年：為鼓勵現有建築物更適時採用綠色節能設備和技術，以更全面發揮能源審核的益處，我們將能源審核的周期由現時的10年縮短至五年，讓我們的安排與鄰近地區，例如內地、新加坡和日本東京相若；

（四）公開能源審核報告中若干技術資料：例如主要屋宇裝備裝置的能源效益系數和節能潛力，提高數據的透明度；以及

（五）擴大符合註冊為「註冊能源效益評核人」的資格：我們把能源界別工程師和香港合資格環保專業人員學會的專業會員納入為符合註冊「註冊能源效益評核人」的資格。這將增加可成為「註冊能源效益評核人」的人數，滿足進行能源審核的新需求，有助實施經修訂的《條例》。

《條例草案》在獲得立法會通過並全面實施後，估計到二○三五年將每年額外節省五億度電，相當於15萬個三人家庭的每年用電量。

未來，我們會持續檢視《條例草案》的實施情況，按實際條件逐步將更多類型的建築物和數據納入能源審核。我們亦會研究如何加強對業界的支持。

諮詢及立法會工作

我們早於二○二三年十一月起就《條例草案》作廣泛諮詢，包括行業商會、物業管理業界、建造業界、專業團體、公共服務機構和其他持份者。我們也分別徵詢能源諮詢委員會、碳中和及可持續發展委員會和環境諮詢委員會的意見，並於今年一月徵詢立法會環境事務委員會的意見。持份者和事務委員會均普遍支持修訂建議。

自我們在三月二十六日將《條例草案》於立法會首讀以來，法案委員會於今年四月至五月期間舉行了兩次會議審議《條例草案》，從政策原意、現行條例實施情況、法律草擬等多方面深入探討，並提出許多寶貴的意見。政府經審慎考慮後，採納委員不少的建議，並將就此提出修正案，讓法律條文更為清晰易明。我稍後會在全體委員會階段說明修正案的內容。

落實時間表

《條例草案》如今天獲得立法會通過，我們將會在《憲報》刊登生效日期公告，分兩階段落實修訂：即先在二○二五年九月，即《條例》刊憲後的三個月後更新「註冊能源效益評核人」註冊的認可資格，並在二○二六年九月，即《條例》刊憲後的15個月實施其餘條文，以全面實施經修訂後的《條例》。

結語

主席，今次修訂《條例》可以達致三贏局面：一是為建築物節省電費、二是減少碳排放、三是促進綠色經濟發展，助力香港在二○五○年前實現碳中和。我謹此陳辭，懇請各位議員支持及通過《條例草案》。"
立法會五題：粵車南下,2025-06-11 15:40,2025-06-11 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100467.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上黎棟國議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

據報，隨着港珠澳大橋（大橋）香港口岸人工島自動化停車場於年底落成，當局計劃最快今年底起分階段實施「粵車南下」，有關計劃設有配額，獲配額的粵車在首階段只可停泊在大橋香港口岸的自動化停車場，旅客可無須辦理入境手續直接到香港國際機場禁區乘機離港，或經大橋香港口岸入境香港後，轉乘其他交通工具進入市區。「粵車南下」第二階段才開放粵車進入市區。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）分兩個階段實施「粵車南下」的原因為何；會否考慮將兩個階段合併推行，以回應各界加快吸引自駕遊旅客的訴求；

（二）會否就車流量較大的市區個別地段，劃定粵車禁區，以及會否因應周末、周日和香港假期時，市區交通相對稀疏及暢順，加大「粵車南下」的每日配額；及

（三）有否評估，「粵車南下」全面實施後為本港帶來的經濟效益為何？

答覆：

主席：

粵港雙方一直致力推動各項跨境通行措施，共同建設粵港澳大灣區（大灣區），並用好港珠澳大橋（大橋）。「港車北上」自二○二三年七月成功推出，允許合資格的香港單牌私家車可在內地海關免擔保政策下，只需作簡單預約便可以自駕方式經大橋到廣東省各個商業中心、鄉郊地區、旅遊熱點等作短期商務、探親或旅遊，讓香港旅客赴粵的出行規劃更為方便。北上的香港私家車數目正節節上升，已有超過10萬輛曾參加「港車北上」；大橋的使用量亦屢創新高，今年五月的雙向車流量達45萬車次，即每日平均約15 000車次，比「港車北上」未實施前上升約170%；其中按「港車北上」出行的車輛佔大橋車流約四成，即每日平均約6 000車次。同時，為回應市民雙向奔赴的殷切期盼，為內地訪客來港提供多元化體驗，我們正與內地有關部門積極籌劃「粵車南下」實施安排。

就黎棟國議員提問的三個部分，我現答覆如下：

（一）「港車北上」的推展經驗，為粵港規劃「粵車南下」提供實際和具體的參考。粵港政府持續監察市民的申請和出行體驗，相繼推出優化安排，包括每日接受申請數目由最初200宗逐漸增加至現時500宗；車輛查驗中心由最初一間增加至現時三間；擴闊每個預約出行時段，並推遲「最後預約」和「取消預約」的期限等。粵港也共同提升大橋口岸通關暢達度，以應對大橋持續上升的車流。而廣東各地亦陸續推出便利「港車北上」車輛的配套設施與宣傳。

「粵車南下」作為「港車北上」的反向互惠安排，合資格的廣東私家車也可在無需取得常規配額，以及在已提前預約的條件下，經大橋到香港作短期商務、探親或旅遊。綜觀「港車北上」的經驗，我們需要穩妥推行「粵車南下」，同時提速提效。我們早前已公布鄰近大橋香港口岸的兩個自動化停車場會作為「粵車南下」的一部分，供廣東及澳門私家車經大橋來港停泊。將車輛停泊「轉機停車場」的旅客可到香港國際機場轉乘飛機，進一步便利大灣區旅客經香港往來全球各地，鞏固香港作為國際航空樞紐的領先地位；而停泊「訪港停車場」的旅客則可到大橋旅檢大樓辦理入境手續，為訪港旅客提供多一個選項，有利於兩地人員流通，提供經濟動力。目前，政府及機管局（香港機場管理局）正積極進行啓用前的預備工作，包括進行測試和演習、制訂預約和使用細則，目標是盡量簡化流程，為旅客提供最大方便。此外，我們正在籌劃宣傳工作及優惠，以吸引自駕旅客，帶動本港的零售、餐飲、酒店及相關服務業。

（二）與此同時，我們亦正與廣東攜手為粵車入境香港市區作預早準備。我們在不同方面包括總量控制、口岸通關、風險管理、提升配套設施等着手，予以周全考慮。一方面評估口岸交通和道路的承載力，引導車流避免尖峰，以及強化口岸過關和交通配備和預案；另一方面妥善管理風險，例如要求南下的車輛依據香港的法規，確保車輛安全性和購買香港第三者保險；亦正制訂有關的申請程序、駕駛規則、配套設施等的宣傳資訊；希望在風險可控的前提下，簡化申請程序，為申請人提供便利。按照以上安排，「粵車南下」將達至有序推展、用家歡迎、市民安心、社會受惠，從而無需為粵車另設有關車輛的限制區域或道路。

（三）我們相信在有序推展和總量控制，以及配套措施到位的條件下，「粵車南下」能為旅客來港帶來便捷和具彈性的出行新選擇，可以按其所需，各適其適，進行旅遊、經商、出席展覽或會議、參加音樂會或其他大型活動、尋求各種專業服務和休閒飲食等，預期香港各行各業將會受惠；與「港車北上」產生的協同效應，亦將為粵港經濟及大灣區融合發展注入更大動能。

特區政府現正繼續與各內地相關部門積極制訂穩妥有序推展「粵車南下」的實施安排和時間表，我本人亦親自帶領團隊與廣東商討，務求爭取於今年內盡快公布細節。

多謝主席。"
LCQ5: Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles,2025-06-11 15:40,2025-06-11 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100473.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Lai Tung-kwok and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

It is reported that following the completion of the automated car park on the Hong Kong Port Island of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) by the end of this year, the authorities plan to implement the Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles in phases starting as early as the end of this year. The scheme runs with quotas and Guangdong vehicles allocated with quotas under the first phase will only be allowed to park at the automated car park at the HZMB Hong Kong Port. Passengers may proceed directly to the restricted area of Hong Kong International Airport and depart Hong Kong by plane without going through immigration clearance, or enter Hong Kong via the HZMB Hong Kong Port and then transfer to other modes of transport to reach the urban areas. Guangdong vehicles will only be allowed access to the urban areas under the second phase of the Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the reasons for implementing the Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles in two phases; whether it will consider implementing the two phases in one go by merging them, so as to address the calls from various sectors for attracting road trip visitors more expeditiously;

(2) whether it will designate no-entry zones for Guangdong vehicles in specific urban areas with heavier traffic, and whether it will increase the daily quota for the Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles on weekends, Sundays, and Hong Kong public holidays when urban traffic is relatively light and smooth; and

(3) whether it has assessed the economic benefits brought to Hong Kong upon the full implementation of the Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles?

Reply:

President,

Guangdong and Hong Kong have been committed to implementing various cross-boundary transport measures to jointly develop the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and to make good use of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB). Since the successful implementation of Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles (the Northbound Travel Scheme) in July 2023, eligible Hong Kong single-plate private cars are allowed to travel under the customs guarantee-free policy to various commercial centres, countryside, tourist hotspots, etc, in the Guangdong Province via the HZMB for business, visiting families or sight-seeing on a short-term basis upon making simple bookings; thus allowing greater convenience for Hong Kong travellers to plan their travel. The number of northbound Hong Kong private cars to the Guangdong Province has been on the rise, with over 100 000 private cars which have participated in the scheme. The usage of the HZMB has also recorded new highs, with its two-way vehicular flow reaching a total of 450 000 vehicles in May 2025 (i.e. a daily average of about 15 000 vehicles), representing an increase of about 170 per cent as compared to that before the implementation of the Northbound Travel Scheme; among which vehicles under the Northbound Travel Scheme account for about 40per cent of the HZMB's vehicular flow (i.e. a daily average of about 6 000 vehicles). Meanwhile, to meet the keen expectations of the public on two-way travel, and to provide diversified experiences for Mainland travellers to visit Hong Kong, we are actively working with the relevant Mainland authorities on the implementation arrangements for the Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles (the Southbound Travel Scheme).

In response to the three parts of the question raised by the Hon Lai Tung-kwok, my reply is as follows:

(1) The experience of implementing the Northbound Travel Scheme provides pragmatic and substantive reference for the planning of the Southbound Travel Scheme between Guangdong and Hong Kong. The governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong have been monitoring the application and travel experience of the citizens in a bid to roll out a number of enhanced arrangements, which include gradually increasing the maximum number of applications received per day from 200 at the beginning to the current 500; increasing the number of vehicle inspection centres from one at the beginning to three at present; expanding the travel booking timeslots, while deferring the deadline of booking and cancellation of booking. Guangdong and Hong Kong have also worked together to enhance port clearance at the HZMB ports, so as to address the increasing vehicular flow of the HZMB. Meanwhile, various parts of Guangdong are successively providing ancillary facilities to facilitate the vehicles under the Northbound Travel Scheme and launching promotion.

As regards the Southbound Travel Scheme which is the reverse reciprocal arrangement of the Northbound Travel Scheme, eligible Guangdong private cars without regular quotas will also be allowed to travel to Hong Kong via the HZMB for business, visiting families or sight-seeing on a short-term basis under the condition that advance bookings have been made. Drawing on the experience from the Northbound Travel Scheme, we need to ensure that the Southbound Travel Scheme is taken forward in a prudent manner while enhancing speed and efficiency. We have earlier announced the two automated carparks near the HZMB Hong Kong Port as part of the Southbound Travel Scheme, where private cars from Guangdong and Macao can park when they come to Hong Kong via the HZMB. Visitors who park their cars at the ""Park and Fly"" carpark could transfer flight at Hong Kong International Airport, thereby further facilitates the transport of travellers of the GBA to and from all parts of the world via Hong Kong, as well as consolidate Hong Kong's position as a leading international aviation hub. Visitors who park at the ""Park and Visit"" carpark could go through immigration clearance at the passenger clearance building of the HZMB, which provides visitors to Hong Kong with an additional option, thereby promotes the flow of people between the two places and drives economic growth. At present, the Government and theAirport Authority Hong Kong are actively undertaking preparatory work for the commencement of operation, including conducting tests and drills, as well as formulating the details in respect of the booking and use of the carparks. Our objective is to streamline the procedures as far as possible to provide maximum convenience for travellers. In addition, we are planning promotional activities and discounts, with a view to attracting self-drive visitors, which will in turn stimulate the retail, food and beverage, hotel and related service sectors in Hong Kong.

(2) Meanwhile, we are also working with Guangdong to make early preparation for Guangdong vehicles to enter Hong Kong urban area. We are taking comprehensive consideration of various aspects, including total volume control, port clearance, risk management and enhancement of supporting facilities. On one hand, we will assess traffic at the port and the capacity of nearby roads, divert traffic away from peak hours, and strengthen port clearance as well as ancillary transport arrangements and contingency plans; on the other hand, we will properly manage the risks, such as requiring southbound vehicles to comply with the rules and regulations of Hong Kong to ensure the safety of their vehicles and take out a Hong Kong third party insurance. We are also formulating publicity information covering application procedures, driving rules and ancillary facilities. Where risks are controllable, we will streamline the application procedures and provide convenience for applicants. Following the above arrangements, the Southbound Travel Scheme will be implemented in orderly manner, welcomed by users, to the satisfaction of the public, and beneficial to the community at large; thereby obviating the need to impose restricted zones or roads for Guangdong vehicles.

(3) We believe that under the conditions of orderly implementation, total volume control, and appropriate supporting measures, the Southbound Travel Scheme will provide visitors with convenient and flexible new travel option to Hong Kong for travel, business, attending exhibitions or conferences, participating in concerts or other large-scale events, seeking various professional services, leisure and dining, etc, according to their need. It is expected that various industries in Hong Kong will benefit; and the synergy effect achieved with the Northbound Travel Scheme will also add extra impetus to the economies of Guangdong and Hong Kong, and the integration and development of the GBA.

The HKSAR Government is proactively working with respective Mainland authorities to formulate the implementation arrangements and timetable for taking forward the Southbound Travel Scheme in an orderly manner. I myself have also been leading a team to discuss with Guangdong side, with a view to striving for early announcement of the details of the scheme within this year.

Thank you, President."

答覆︰

主席：

就周文港議員的提問，現綜合回覆如下：

香港整體教育競爭力在全球排名前五，專上教育高度國際化和多元化，至今五所大學教育資助委員會（教資會）資助大學打入全球百強，六所資助大學位列亞洲五十強，多所大學在全球最國際化大學排名中名列前茅，並擁有優秀的研究人才，對全球學生學者深具吸引力。各所大學均按其院校發展策略，以及教學和研究的需要進行全球招聘，不斷增強自身的環球競爭優勢。由政務司司長督導的教育、科技和人才委員會的帶領下，政府會繼續推動國際高端人才集聚香港，統籌推進教育、科技和人才一體化融合發展，擴大銜接連貫，制訂政策推動育才、匯才、科技協同發展，以鞏固香港作為國際專上教育樞紐及國際創新科技中心的地位。

過去多年，隨着政府增加對高等教育的資源投放及推出多項支持措施，教資會資助大學的教務部門職員人數由二○二一／二二學年的13 548人增加4.5%至二○二三／二四學年的14 161人，當中高級及初級教學人員數目增加8.5%由4 974人增至5 398人。離職人數亦由399人下跌至378人。整體來説，香港高等院校正積極推展「擴容提質」的目標，在招攬和挽留人才均取得一定成效。

各大學教務部門職員按職級、大學及部門成本中心組別劃分的實際人員數目見附件一，而高級／初級教學人員的入職及離職人數分別見附件二及附件三。我們並無備存教學輔助人員、行政、技術及其他人員和硏究技術人員的入職及離職人數，以及教職員背景或離職原因（如退休、完成合約、轉至其他本地大學任職等）的分項數字。

因應目前全球教育格局變化，教育局已即時呼籲全港所有大學，為受影響的學生學者提供便利措施，維護他們的正當合法權益，並按各院校多元招生及人才政策，吸引頂尖人才。教育局樂見本港各大學均積極回應及密切留意情況，充分善用政府支持本地專上院校擴容提質的便利措施。

我們會繼續密切留意事態發展，並因應他們的需要通盤考慮支援方案，發揮香港作為國際專上教育樞紐的角色。除院校的招聘措施外，政府亦通過一系列措施，包括提升政府資助的專上院校非本地學生限額一倍至40%、增加獎學金名額、並逐步增加香港博士研究生獎學金計劃名額，吸引更多傑出人才來港就學。我們會繼續推展各項政策措施，並在國家、地區和國際層面推動聯繫網絡和夥伴關係，亦會繼續與各持份者合作，加強推廣及宣傳「留學香港」品牌，致力配合國家科教興國、優質人才、創新發展的戰略，為國家的需要貢獻我們的力量。"

(1) whether it knows the numbers of newly-joined academic staff members (including but not limited to (i) senior academic staff, (ii) junior academic staff, (iii) academic supporting staff, (iv) administrative, technical and other staff, and (v) technical research staff) of the eight universities funded by the University Grants Committee (the eight universities) in each of the past three academic years, as well as their respective percentages in the academic staff members of the respective ranks, together with a breakdown by (A) university, (B) academic programme/department (including but not limited to (I) Medicine, Dentistry and Health, (II) Sciences and (III) Education and Continuing Education), and (C) background of relevant academic staff members (i.e. (a) holders of Hong Kong Permanent Identity Cards, and (b) holders of visas granted by the Immigration Department under the Top Talent Pass Scheme, General Employment Policy and Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates, etc);

(2) whether it knows the numbers of academic staff members of the eight universities who left the service (including but not limited to those mentioned in (i) to (v) in (1)) in each of the past three academic years, as well as their respective percentages in the academic staff members of the respective ranks, together with a breakdown by (A) to (C) mentioned in (1));

(3) regarding the departure situation mentioned in (2), whether it knows the reasons for departure of the academic staff members of the eight universities in each of the past three academic years (e.g. retirement, transfer to another local university, change of profession and other reasons), and whether it has analysed their departure trends, together with a breakdown by university; and

(4) as there are views that as the United States (US) has further tightened its visa policy on non-US academics as well as research and development (R&D) personnel, and the relevant countries in the European Union have also introduced measures one after another to ""trawl talent"", whether the authorities will introduce stronger and more effective measures to attract such people to engage in R&D work in Hong Kong, so as to develop Hong Kong into an international hub for high-calibre talent; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Our reply to Professor the Hon Chow Man-kong's question is as follows:

Hong Kong's overall competitiveness in education ranks among the top five in the world, and our post-secondary education is highly internationalised and diversified. To date, five University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities have been ranked among the top 100 in the world, six are ranked among the top 50 in Asia, a number of them have been ranked among the top universities in the world's most international universities ranking, and they have excellent research talent, which make them attractive to students and scholars from all over the world. The universities are recruiting globally following their institutional development strategies and their teaching and research needs, so as to continuously enhance their global competitiveness. Under the leadership of the Committee on Education, Technology and Talents led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, the Government will continue to promote Hong Kong as an international hub for high-calibre talent, co-ordinate and drive the integrated development of education, technology and talent, expand connections, formulate policies to attract and cultivate talent, and foster the co-ordinated development of technologies, so as to strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international post-secondary education hub and an international innovation and technology centre.

Over the past years, with the Government's increased investment in higher education and the introduction of various support measures, the staff number in academic departments of the UGC-funded universities has increased by 4.5 per cent from 13 548 in the 2021/22 academic year (AY) to 14 161 in the 2023/24 AY, with an increase of 8.5 per cent in the number of senior and junior academic staff from 4 974 to 5 398. The number of leaving academic staff has also dropped from 399 to 378. Overall, Hong Kong's higher education institutions are proactively pursuing the goal of capacity expansion and quality enhancement, and have achieved certain success in recruiting and retaining talent.

The actual numbers of staff in the academic departments of universities by staff grade, university and departmental cost centre group are at Annex I. The numbers of senior/junior academic staff joining and leaving are at Annex II and Annex III respectively. We do not have a breakdown of the number of intake and departure of academic supporting staff, administrative, technical, and other staff and technical research staff, as well as a breakdown of the background of the staff or the reasons for departure, such as retirement, completion of contract, transfer to other local universities, etc.

In the light of the changes in the global higher education landscape, the Education Bureau (EDB) has promptly called on all universities in Hong Kong to introduce facilitation measures for affected students and scholars with a view to safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests, while attracting top talent in accordance with their diversified admissions and talent policies. The EDB is pleased to see that local universities are responding proactively and closely monitoring the situation, fully utilising the Government's facilitation initiatives that support the capacity expansion and quality enhancement of post-secondary institutions in Hong Kong.

We will continue to keep a close eye on the development and accordingly consider support measures for them in a holistic approach so as to give full play to Hong Kong's role as an international post-secondary education hub. Apart from the recruitment measures of the institutions, the Government attracts more top talent to pursue their studies in Hong Kong through a range of initiatives, including doubling the cap on non-local students in publicly funded post-secondary institutions to 40 per cent, increasing scholarship quotas, and gradually increasing the number of places under the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme. We remain committed to pursuing various policies and initiatives, fostering networks and partnerships at the national, regional, and; international levels, and will continue to work collaboratively with stakeholders to promote the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand. These efforts align with the national strategies to invigorate the country through science and education, cultivate high-calibre talent, and advance innovation and development, thereby contributing to meeting the needs of our nation."
《2025年飛機乘客離境稅條例（修訂附表2）令》周五刊憲,2025-06-11 15:30,2025-06-11 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100326.htm,"《2025年飛機乘客離境稅條例（修訂附表2）令》（修訂令）將於本周五（六月十三日）刊憲，以擴大《飛機乘客離境稅條例》（第140章）（條例）下獲豁免繳付飛機乘客離境稅的乘客範圍。

條例現時容許若干類別的乘客豁免繳付離境稅，包括12歲以下兒童、直接或轉機過境、在同一日內乘搭飛機抵港及離港、乘搭車輛經港珠澳大橋或乘搭船舶抵達香港國際機場（機場），並在其後乘搭飛機離開香港前一直停留在限制區內的人士等。

二零二五至二六年度《財政預算案》公布離境稅由每名乘客120元調升至200元。雖然增幅只佔市民和旅客的整體出行開支很小部分，對飛機乘客影響輕微，但為了提高香港國際機場競爭力，政府考慮持份者意見後，條例下的豁免範圍將擴大至涵蓋：

（一）乘搭飛機抵達機場，然後於抵達當日或下一日於機場乘搭飛機離境的乘客（即最多四十八小時）﹔及

（二）以乘搭飛機以外的方式經過出入境檢查抵達香港，然後於抵達當日或下一日於機場乘搭飛機離境的乘客（即最多四十八小時）。條例將加入豁除條文，以防止個別人士刻意在短時間內往返香港和內地或澳門以符合豁免離境稅資格。

兩項新增豁免將於今年十月一日與離境稅新稅率一併生效，於當日或之後抵港並符合豁免條件的乘客將獲豁免離境稅。根據二○二四年航空客運統計數字，兩項豁免每年可惠及約83萬名航空轉機乘客和約250萬名多式聯運轉機乘客，政府每年收入可能減少約6億7千萬元。

政府發言人說︰「新增豁免有助吸引更多乘客使用機場，從而鞏固香港作為國際航空樞紐的地位。由於會有更多轉機旅客在逗留期間在酒店住宿和本地消費，豁免將帶來正面經濟效益。」

政府將委託香港機場管理局（機管局）一站式處理所有合資格乘客的退款申請。機管局將設立新電子申請平台，供乘客申請在機場收取現金退款或以其他方式（例如信用卡和電子支付平台）退款。

修訂令將於六月十八日提交立法會省覽，進行先訂立後審議程序。"
Air Passenger Departure Tax Ordinance (Amendment of Second Schedule) Order 2025 to be gazetted this Friday,2025-06-11 15:30,2025-06-11 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100324.htm,"  The Air Passenger Departure Tax Ordinance (Amendment of Second Schedule) Order 2025 will be gazetted this Friday (June 13) to expand the scope of passengers to be exempted from paying the air passenger departure tax (APDT) under the Air Passenger Departure Tax Ordinance (Cap. 140) (the Ordinance).

  The Ordinance currently allows certain classes of passengers to be exempted from payment of the APDT, including children under 12 years of age, direct transit or connecting flight passengers, passengers who arrive at and depart from Hong Kong by aircraft on the same day, and passengers who arrive at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) by vehicle via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge or by ship and subsequently depart from Hong Kong by aircraft while remaining within the restricted area at all times before departure, etc.

  The 2025-26 Budget announced the increase of APDT from $120 to $200 per passenger. While the increase will only have a minimal impact on air passengers as it constitutes only a very small portion of the overall travelling cost of the general public and tourists, with a view to enhancing the competitiveness of HKIA, the Government, having considered the stakeholders' view, will expand the exemption scope under the Ordinance to include:

(1) passengers arriving at HKIA by aircraft and departing from HKIA by aircraft on the arrival day or on the following day (i.e. a maximum of 48 hours); and

(2) passengers arriving in Hong Kong through immigration controls by means other than by aircraft and departing from HKIA by aircraft on the arrival day or on the following day (i.e. a maximum of 48 hours), with an exclusionary provision incorporated to prevent people from making a brief return trip between Hong Kong and the Mainland or Macao deliberately so that they can be eligible for an exemption of the APDT.

  The two new exemptions will take effect on October 1 this year, together with the new tax rate of the APDT. Passengers arriving in Hong Kong on or after that day and meeting the exemption criteria will be exempted from the APDT. Based on air passenger traffic statistics in 2024, the two exemptions could benefit about 830 000 air transfer passengers and about 2.5 million intermodal transfer passengers annually, leading to a potential revenue foregone of about $670 million per year.

  A Government spokesman said, ""The new exemptions can help attract more passengers to use HKIA, thus consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub. As there will be more transfer passengers' spending on hotel accommodation and local consumption during their stay, the exemptions are expected to bring about positive economic benefits.""

  The Government will engage the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AA) to handle refund applications centrally for all eligible passengers. The AA will set up a new e-application platform for passengers to apply for receiving the refund by cash at the airport or by other means, such as credit cards and electronic payment platforms.

  The Order will be tabled at the Legislative Council for negative vetting on June 18."

"Applications for new niches at Wo Hop Shek, Cape Collinson-San Ha and Shek Mun Columbariums to close on June 18",2025-06-11 15:15,2025-06-11 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100575.htm,"  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (June 11) reminded members of the public who wish to apply for allocations of new extendable niches at Wo Hop Shek Columbarium Phase VI in Fanling, Cape Collinson-San Ha Columbarium in Eastern District or Shek Mun Columbarium in Sha Tin for the deceased to promptly submit their applications on or before the deadline of June 18 (Wednesday).

  An FEHD spokesman said, ""For this niche allocation exercise, Wo Hop Shek Columbarium Phase VI provides 4 000 standard niches and 50 large niches; Cape Collinson-San Ha Columbarium provides 6 000 standard niches and 50 large niches, while Shek Mun Columbarium provides 6 000 standard smoke-free niches and 50 large smoke-free niches.""

  Taking into account the views of residents in the vicinity, Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance will be a smoke-free columbarium project, i.e. the columbarium will not provide any facilities for burning joss sticks and offerings. Burning of joss sticks and incense offerings will be banned completely within the columbarium area, including all floors and common areas.

  Members of the public can apply online or download the application form from the FEHD website (www.fehd.gov.hk) or the Platform for Cemeteries and Crematoria Services (app.fehd.gov.hk/ccsp). They can also obtain the application form in person from the Hong Kong or Kowloon Cemeteries and Crematoria Office, District Environmental Hygiene Offices of the FEHD, or Home Affairs Enquiry Centres of the Home Affairs Department, or by fax via hotline 2841 9111.

  The spokesman advises applicants to give priority to an online submission to avoid postal delays or non-delivery. Upon submission, applicants will promptly receive an acknowledgement receipt with a case number, thus facilitating the follow-up of the application in the future. If the applicant is the same person who has applied for the cremation service for the deceased, it is more convenient to submit the application online by exempting the need to attach copies of the required documents and having the application online granted automatically. If not submitting their application online, applicants shall submit the completed application form together with copies of the required documents by the above-mentioned fax or email, by post or in person to the Hong Kong or Kowloon Cemeteries and Crematoria Office within the application period.

  To avoid missing the application deadline, the spokesman reminded those intending to apply for allocation of the above niches for the deceased to submit the completed application forms together with the copies of required documents on or before June 18.

Scrap trader fined for using inaccurate electronic platform scale (with photo),2025-06-11 14:55,2025-06-11 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100407.htm,"An owner and an operator of a scrap trader were each fined $4,000 yesterday (June 10) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts for using an inaccurate electronic platform scale for trade, in contravention of the Weights and Measures Ordinance (WMO). The electronic platform scale concerned was also confiscated by the court.

Hong Kong Customs earlier received information alleging that a scrap trader in Wan Chai used an inaccurate electronic platform scale to weigh scrap copper. Customs officers then took enforcement action by posing as a vendor selling scrap copper to the trader concerned, whereupon they found that the trader had used an inaccurate platform scale for weighing the scrap copper. A subsequent examination by an accredited laboratory confirmed that the electronic platform scale was inaccurate and the weight shown was about 23 per cent less than its actual weight, thereby paying a lower recycling price. The trader paid $60 less in the case.

Under the WMO, any person who uses for trade, or has in his possession for use for trade, any weighing or measuring equipment which is false or defective commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $25,000. The false or defective weighing or measuring equipment is liable to forfeiture. In addition, if any fraud is committed in the use for trade of any weighing or measuring equipment, the person perpetrating the fraud commits an offence. The maximum penalty is a fine of $25,000 and imprisonment for six months.

Customs reminds traders that they should use accurate weighing equipment and comply with the requirements of the WMO when recycling scrap.

Hong Kong Customs appeals to the public to report any case of suspected fraud using defective weighing or measuring equipment to the department by 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

香港海關早前接獲舉報，指一間位於灣仔的廢料回收商涉嫌使用不準確的電子地磅秤量廢銅。其後，海關人員採取執法行動，喬裝成賣家到該回收商售賣廢銅，並發現該商販所用的電子地磅不準確。經認可化驗所檢測後，證實該電子地磅不準確，令顯示的秤量重量較實際輕達百分二十三，藉此支付較低的回收價。案件中該商販少付六十元。

根據《條例》，任何人使用或管有任何偽誤或不完備的度量衡器具以作商業用途，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二萬五千元，有關的偽誤或不準確的度量衡器具會被沒收。此外，如任何人士被發現使用度量衡器具作商業用途時涉及欺詐行為，均屬違法，最高刑罰為罰款二萬五千元及監禁六個月。

海關提醒商戶在回收廢料時須使用準確的量重器具並遵守《條例》的規定。

立法會十七題：打擊詐騙電話及短訊,2025-06-11 14:53,2025-06-11 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100395.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上黃國議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

有不少市民向本人反映，近年詐騙電話及來自即時通訊應用程式（例如WhatsApp）和電話的詐騙短訊數量持續增加。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於據悉，不少市民不斷被不明帳號加入到即時通訊應用程式內的疑似詐騙群組，當中更有不少帳號以海外電話號碼登記，此外，該等群組以「點讚分紅」和「股票投資」等作招徠，過去一年，警方接獲多少名市民的報案、涉及的騙款總額，以及被捕人數分別為何；當局有何針對性措施打擊該等群組的詐騙行為；

（二）鑑於據悉，有不少騙徒入侵市民的即時通訊應用程式帳戶，以向他們的聯絡人借款和充值點數卡，過去一年，警方接獲多少名市民的報案、涉及的騙款總額，以及被捕人數分別為何；當局有否分析有何不安全使用該等程式的行為會增加帳戶被入侵的風險，以及有何針對性措施打擊該等帳戶被騙徒入侵的行為；

（三）鑑於據悉，騙徒以手機短訊冒認政府部門及機構的官方平台、銀行、電訊商或鄰居行騙的情況日趨嚴重，過去一年，警方接獲多少名市民的報案、涉及的騙款總額，以及被捕人數分別為何；對於由本地及海外發出的詐騙短訊，當局的跟進行動分別為何；當局在確認相關電話號碼涉及詐騙行為後，封鎖該等電話號碼的平均所需時間為何；及

（四）鑑於有不少市民反映，他們經常重覆收到具有詐騙成分的促銷電話，對他們造成滋擾，更有惡化趨勢，當局會否檢視現行規管該等電話的法例是否有不足之處；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

詐騙是嚴重罪行。任何人干犯《盜竊罪條例》（第210章）第16A條「欺詐罪」，最高可判處監禁14年；若被控同一條例第17條「以欺騙手段取得財產」，最高可判處監禁10年。另外，任何人因詐騙得益而被控《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章）第25條「處理已知道或相信為代表從可公訴罪行的得益的財產」，最高可判處監禁14年及罰款500萬元。不論是透過電話、通訊軟件或其他方式進行，只要涉及違法行為，特區政府都會嚴厲打擊。基於互聯網興起的全球大趨勢，不少國家和地區近年均見詐騙案顯著上升。香港警務處會持續透過加強執法、宣傳教育、多機構合作、情報分析及跨境合作，提高市民的警覺性，打擊各類型的詐騙案。

就議員的提問，經諮詢商務及經濟發展局及警方後，回覆如下：

（一）題述的「股票投資」騙案涉及騙徒在網上社交平台、討論區或即時通訊軟件以「低風險、高回報」作招徠，誘騙受害人參與虛假的投資計劃。警方將此類騙案歸類為「網上投資騙案」，二○二四年共錄得3 930宗，涉及騙款額約22.6億元；二○二五年首四個月共有1 534宗，涉及金額約為10.2億元。

至於題述的「點讚分紅」騙案，則涉及騙徒透過網上社交平台招攬受害人登記為「點讚員」，向受害人聲稱只要在繳付「保證金」後在指定社交平台上點擊「讚好」便可獲得酬勞，而繳付的保證金越多，每次「讚好」所得的酬勞便越多，實則是騙取保證金的手段。警方將此類騙案歸類為「網上求職騙案」，二○二四年共錄得3 853宗，騙款約8億元；二○二五年首四個月有1 515宗，涉及金額約3.4億元。

警方沒有就個別騙案分類的被捕人數作分項統計。

針對這類詐騙行為，警方從執法、跨境協作及宣傳教育方面着手。由於現時本港大部分騙案利用傀儡戶口收款，打擊傀儡戶口是打擊詐騙產業鏈的有效方法。二○二四年，警方就涉及各類型騙案及洗黑錢的罪行共拘捕10 496人；二○二五年首四個月共拘捕2 532人，當中約七成被捕人士是傀儡戶口持有人。警方亦自二○二三年底起，就涉及傀儡戶口的案件，向法庭申請引用《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》第27條加重刑罰，以加強阻嚇力。

在跨境協作方面，香港警務處上月聯同澳門特別行政區、馬來西亞、馬爾代夫、新加坡、韓國和泰國警方，進行反詐騙跨境合作平台「FRONTIER+」的首次聯合行動，攜手打擊跨境詐騙犯罪活動，成功識別並瓦解多個跨境詐騙網絡，共拘捕1 858人，涉及9 268宗包括投資騙案在內的詐騙案。

在宣傳方面，有見上述兩類騙案在二○二五年初有所增加，警方在過去數月不時舉辦記者會，並透過守網者網站、Facebook等不同渠道加強宣傳，提醒市民保持警惕（包括向市民解釋騙徒的最新行騙手法及講解市民可如何防範），例如善用WhatsApp的私隱設定功能，只讓通訊錄中的聯絡人將用戶加入群組，以防被陌生人拉入詐騙群組。

（二）騙徒常用多種手法來盜取社交媒體帳戶，包括假客服和假網站。常見的手法是發送釣魚短訊，聲稱帳戶有安全風險，誘使用戶點擊連結，在假網站輸入帳戶登入資料或掃描二維碼，從而騎劫帳戶，並向用戶親友發送要求借錢或購買遊戲點數卡的訊息。

相關騙案被歸類為「網上戶口盜用」案件，二○二四年共接獲2 989宗，涉及金額約9,100萬元。警方未有就個別騙案分類的被捕人數作分項統計。

警方從多角度加強打擊相關騙案，包括已於二○二三年底要求電訊商攔截涉及虛假WhatsApp網頁廣告的網頁，並已向相關的網頁搜尋器及海外有關當局提出移除相關假網站的要求，亦繼續透過多渠道「鋪天蓋地」宣傳防騙信息，提高市民大眾的防騙意識，以及持續推廣「防騙視伏器」及「防騙視伏App」的應用。其中，警方呼籲市民應啓用雙重認證功能；定期檢視帳戶所連結的裝置，並且登出所有不明的已連結裝置；不要盡信搜尋器的結果，建議將常用網頁加入書籤；並避免連接公共Wi-Fi或在公共電腦上登入網上帳號。

經警方一連串的宣傳教育工作，去年的「網上戶口盜用」案件數字較二○二三年下跌13%，二○二五年首四個月更比去年同期進一步下跌63%。警方會繼續密切留意詐騙案的趨勢，不時檢視打擊騙案的措施及策略，以加強對市民的保障。

（三）視乎行騙手法，涉及冒認他人身分的詐騙案可被歸類為釣魚騙案、網上投資騙案甚至網上情緣騙案等，警方未有就冒認他人身分的騙案備存分項數字。

針對騙徒冒認政府部門、官方機構及銀行等發送短訊的情況，通訊事務管理局辦公室（通訊辦）自二○二三年十二月二十八日起推出「短訊發送人登記制」（登記制），並於二○二四年二月全面開放予各行業加入。截至二○二五年五月底，已有超過540個公私營機構（包括入境事務處、衞生署、警方、消費者委員會、主要銀行及電訊商等）參與登記制。在登記制下，只有已登記成為「已獲認證的發送人」的公司或機構，才可使用其以「#」號開頭的「已登記的短訊發送人名稱」發出短訊。電訊商會攔截由非已獲認證的發送人透過互聯網發出的偽冒短訊。

警方於二○二三年二月推出手機應用程式「防騙視伏App」，協助市民分辨可疑網上平台帳戶、收款帳戶、電話號碼、電郵地址及網址等，並提供防騙提示。現時「防騙視伏App」已經升級至備有自動偵測功能，應用程式內可疑來電警示及可疑網站偵測的功能會自動辨識詐騙來電和詐騙網站，如發現潛在詐騙或網絡安全風險，會即時發出通知，提醒用戶不要接聽或瀏覽。

此外，在通訊辦的協調下，警方及主要電訊商已建立機制，電訊商會根據警方提供的詐騙紀錄盡快攔截涉嫌進行詐騙的電話號碼及可疑網頁連結。通訊辦並沒有備存電訊商相關行動的平均所需時間紀錄。

（四）政府理解公眾對促銷電話的關注，惟促銷電話的性質與詐騙電話截然不同，促銷電話未必涉及欺詐或非法行為，兩者不應混為一談。部分企業（特別是中小企）仍需依賴語音促銷電話進行市場推廣及服務跟進，因此，我們需在規管促銷電話與維護正常商業活動之間取得平衡。事實上，世界其他地區在管理促銷電話上同樣面臨挑戰，在操作和執法上（例如如何區分促銷與滋擾或詐騙電話、取證、跨境執法等）仍然存在實際困難，因此政府認為立法規管未必是管理促銷電話最有效的方法。

為減少促銷電話對公眾可能造成的滋擾，通訊辦已在二○二四年優化「營銷電話行業規管計劃」，以行業監管形式限制促銷者在指定時間內致電同一電話號碼的次數，並要求促銷者必須按被致電人的要求提供公司名稱及聯絡方式等資料，及遵從接電者取消接收營銷電話的要求。現時已有七個行業（包括金融、保險、電訊、電話中心、美容、地產代理及放債人行業）的12個商會參與。

此外，通訊辦已要求各電訊商提供來電管理服務供客戶使用，並積極鼓勵市民使用來電過濾應用程式，同時於網頁推廣有關資訊。現時，政府接獲涉及促銷電話的整體查詢及投訴數字顯著下降，由二○一一年的2 060宗大幅減少至二○二五年首五個月的93宗，反映上述措施的成效。

在打擊詐騙電話方面，通訊辦會繼續與電訊業界和警方從多方面降低電騙的風險，包括要求電訊商攔截／暫停涉嫌進行詐騙的電話號碼及網站、攔截以「+852」為開首的可疑來電、就其他以「+852」開首的境外來電向所有流動用戶發送話音提示或文字訊息，以及就新啓動流動電話儲值卡播放提示等，以協助市民防範可疑來電和短訊。"
LCQ17: Combat fraudulent calls and SMS messages,2025-06-11 14:53,2025-06-11 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100396.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Kingsley Wong and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

 Many members of the public have relayed to me about the increasing number of fraudulent calls, as well as fraudulent SMS messages sent via instant messaging applications (e.g. WhatsApp) and phones in recent years. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is learnt that many members of the public have been repeatedly added to suspected fraudulent groups on instant messaging applications by unknown accounts, many of which are registered with overseas phone numbers, and that these groups use ""like-and-earn-rewards"" and ""stock investments"", etc as bait, of the number of reports received by the Police from members of the public in the past year, the total amount of money defrauded, and the number of arrests made; what targeted measures are in place by the authorities to combat fraud by such groups;

(2) as it is learnt that many fraudsters have hacked into the instant messaging application accounts of members of the public to request money and virtual point card top-ups from their contacts, of the number of reports received by the Police from members of the public in the past year, the total amount of money defrauded, and the number of arrests made; whether the authorities have analysed which insecure practices when using such applications increase the risk of account hacking, and what targeted measures are in place to combat such account hacking by fraudsters;

(3) as it is learnt that fraudsters falsely pretending to be the official platforms of government departments and organisations, banks, telecommunications service providers or neighbours via mobile phone SMS messages to commit fraud has become increasingly prevalent, of the number of reports received by the Police from members of the public in the past year, the total amount of money defrauded, and the number of arrests made; what respective follow-up actions the authorities have taken regarding fraudulent SMS messages sent from local and overseas sources; the average time required for the authorities to block the phone numbers concerned after such phone numbers are confirmed to be involved in fraud; and

(4) as many members of the public have relayed that they have frequently received repeated promotional calls containing fraudulent content, causing them nuisance and indicating a worsening trend, whether the authorities will review if the existing legislation governing such calls is inadequate; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 Deception is a serious crime. Any person who commits the offence of ""fraud"" under section 16A of the Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210) is liable to imprisonment for up to 14 years, while any person charged with ""obtaining property by deception"" under section 17 of the same Ordinance is liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years. In addition, any person charged with ""dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" under section 25 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) for proceeds of deception is liable to maximum penalties of 14 years' imprisonment and a fine of $5 million. Regardless of whether it is committed through telephone, messaging applications or other methods, the Government of the Special Administrative Region will take stern enforcement actions as long as there are illegal activities involved. With the global trend of Internet proliferation, many countries and regions have seen a significant increase in fraud cases in recent years. The Police will continue to combat all types of frauds and to enhance public awareness in full force through enhanced law enforcement measures, publicity and education, multi-agency co-operation, intelligence analysis as well as cross-boundary collaboration.

 In consultation with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the Police, the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) ""Stock investment"" scams mentioned in the question involve fraudsters using online social media platforms, discussion forums, or instant messaging apps to lure victims into participating in fake investment schemes by promising ""low risk, high returns"". The Police classify such scams as ""online investment fraud"". In 2024, there were a total of 3 930 cases, involving approximately $2.26 billion in losses; in the first four months of 2025, there were 1 534 cases, involving approximately $1.02 billion.

 As for ""like-and-earn-rewards"" scams mentioned in the question, they involve fraudsters using online social media platforms to recruit victims to register as ""like clickers"". The scammers claim that victims can earn rewards by paying a ""deposit"" and then clicking ""like"" on a designated social media platform; the more deposit paid, the higher the reward per ""like"". However, this is in fact a scheme to defraud victims of their deposits. The Police classify such scams as ""online employment fraud"". In 2024, there were 3 853 reported cases, with total losses amounting to approximately $800 million; in the first four months of 2025, there were 1 515 cases, involving approximately $340 million.

 The Police do not maintain any breakdown of arrested person by types of deception.

 In combatting such fraudulent activities, the Police have taken measures in law enforcement, cross-border collaboration, and public education. Since most fraud cases in Hong Kong currently use stooge accounts to receive payments, cracking down on stooge accounts is an effective method to combat the fraud industry chain. In 2024, the Police arrested a total of 10 496 individuals involved in various types of fraud and money laundering offences; in the first four months of 2025, a total of 2 532 individuals were arrested, approximately 70 per cent of which were holders of stooge accounts. Since the end of 2023, the Police have also applied to the court to invoke Section 27 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance to impose heavier penalties in cases involving stooge accounts, thereby enhancing deterrence.

 In terms of cross-border collaboration, the Hong Kong Police Force recently joined hands with the Police forces of the Macao Special Administrative Region, Malaysia, Maldives, Singapore, Korea, and Thailand, conducted the first joint operation of the Cross-border Anti-Scam Collaboration Platform ""FRONTIER+"", working together to combat cross-border fraud crimes. They successfully identified and dismantled multiple cross-border fraud networks, arresting a total of 1 858 individuals involved in 9 268 fraud cases, including investment fraud.

 In terms of publicity, given the increase in the two aforementioned types of fraud at the beginning of 2025, the Police have held press conferences on multiple occasions over the past few months and utilised various channels, namely the CyberDefender website and Facebook, to enhance publicity efforts and remind the public to remain vigilant (including explaining the latest deception tactics employed by fraudsters and outlining how the public can protect themselves), such as making use of WhatsApp's privacy settings to allow only contacts from one's address book to add the user to groups, thereby preventing being added to fraudulent groups by strangers.

(2) Scammers often use various methods to steal social media accounts, including fake customer service and fake websites. A common tactic is to send phishing messages claiming that the account has encountered security risks, luring users to click on links, enter account login information on fake websites or scan QR codes, thereby hijacking the account and sending messages to the user's friends and family to request loans or the purchase of game point cards.

 Such scams are categorised as ""online account hijacking"" cases, with 2 989 cases reported in 2024, involving approximately $91 million. The Police do not maintain any breakdown of arrested person by types of deception.

 The Police have strengthened efforts to combat such scams from multiple angles, including requesting telecommunication service providers (TSPs) to block websites containing false WhatsApp advertisements by the end of 2023, and submitting requests to relevant search engines and overseas authorities to remove the fake websites. They also continue to promote anti-deception information through various channels to enhance public awareness of fraud prevention, and promoting the use of the Scameter and Scameter+. Among these measures, the Police urge the public to enable two-factor authentication; regularly review the devices linked to their accounts and log out of any unknown connected devices; not to blindly trust search engine results, and instead bookmark frequently used websites; and avoid connecting to public Wi-Fi or logging into online accounts on public computers.

 Following the Police's series of educational campaigns, the number of ""online account hijacking"" cases last year decreased by 13 per cent compared to 2023, and in the first four months of 2025, the figure further dropped by 63 per cent compared to the same period last year. The Police will continue to closely monitor deception trends, regularly review measures and strategies to combat fraud and strengthen protection for the public.

(3) Depending on the method used, fraud cases involving identity theft can be classified as phishing scams, online investment frauds, or even online romance scams. The Police do not maintain breakdown of fraud cases involving identity theft.

 In response to scammers sending text messages by impersonating as government departments, official institutions, and banks, the Office of the Communications Authority (OFCA) launched the SMS Sender Registration Scheme (the Scheme) on December 28, 2023, and fully opened it to all industries to join in February 2024. As at end May 2025, over 540 public and private organisations (including the Immigration Department, the Department of Health, the Police, the Consumer Council, major banks and TSPs) have participated in the Scheme. Under the Scheme, only those companies or organisations qualified as Registered Senders are able to send SMS messages using their Registered SMS Sender IDs with the prefix ""#"". TSPs will block fraudulent SMS messages sent by non-Registered Senders via the Internet.

 In February 2023, the Police launched the mobile application ""Scameter+"" to help members of the public distinguish suspicious online platform accounts, payment accounts, phone numbers, email addresses, websites, etc, and to provide the public with anti-fraud tips. ""Scameter+"" has now been upgraded and is equipped with automatic detection functions. The Call Alert function and the Website Detection function will automatically identify scam calls and fraudulent websites. If potential fraud or cyber security risk is detected, ""Scameter+"" will issue a real-time notification, reminding users not to answer the call or browse the website.

 Moreover, under the co-ordination of the OFCA, the Police and major TSPs have established a mechanism where TSPs will, based on the fraud records provided by the Police, block the telephone numbers suspected to be involved in deception cases and intercept suspicious website links as soon as possible. The OFCA does not maintain any record of the average time required for relevant actions by TSPs.

(4) The Government understands that members of the public are concerned about marketing calls. However, the nature of marketing calls is fundamentally different from scam calls. Marketing calls do not necessarily involve fraud or illegal activities, and hence, the two should not be conflated. Some businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, still rely on voice marketing calls for promotional activities and service follow-ups. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between regulating marketing calls and maintaining normal business activities. In fact, other regions around the world also face similar challenges in managing marketing calls. Practical difficulties remain in operation and enforcement (for example, distinction between marketing calls from nuisance calls or scam calls, evidence collection, cross-border enforcement, etc). As such, the Government believes that regulation by legislation may not be the most effective approach for managing marketing calls.

 To mitigate the possible nuisance caused by marketing calls to the public, the OFCA has enhanced the Industry Regulatory Scheme for Marketing Calls in 2024 to introduce industry-specific regulation to limit the number of calls made by telemarketers to the same telephone number within a specific time frame, as well as requiring telemarketers to provide their names and contact numbers upon recipients' requests, and to honour any unsubscribe requests from the called party. At present, 12 trade associations from seven industries (including finance, insurance, telecommunications, call centres, beauty, estate agencies and money lenders) have joined the scheme.

 In addition, the OFCA has requested TSPs to provide their users with call-filtering services, and actively encourage the use of call-filtering apps by the public, while also promoting relevant information on their websites. The number of enquiries and complaints related to marketing calls received by the Government has drastically reduced from 2 060 cases in 2011 to 93 cases in the first five months of 2025, reflecting the effectiveness of the above measures.

 On combating fraudulent calls, the OFCA will continue to collaborate with the telecommunications industry and the Police to mitigate the risk of phone deception on various fronts, including requiring TSPs to block/suspend suspected fraudulent phone numbers and websites, intercept suspicious calls starting with ""+852"", send voice alerts or text messages to all mobile users for overseas calls prefixed with ""+852"", and play voice alerts for newly activated prepaid SIM cards, so as to assist the public in guarding against suspicious calls and messages."
立法會十四題：行經大欖隧道的專營巴士路線,2025-06-11 14:45,2025-06-11 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100404.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上陸頌雄議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，在政府收回大欖隧道前，公共單層及雙層巴士使用大欖隧道的收費分別高達180元及213元，導致行經大欖隧道的專營巴士路線票價顯著高於其他不行經大欖隧道但路線長度相若的巴士路線，最終加重元朗區居民在出行上的經濟負擔；隨着政府在上月三十一日收回大欖隧道，專營巴士的隧道使用費已大幅下調至43元，行經大欖隧道的巴士路線票價應有下調空間。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，行經大欖隧道的各條專營巴士路線的以下資料：（i）現時成人全程車費、（ii）全程行車里數、（iii）去年行經大欖隧道的班次數目、（iv）去年的載客量、（v）去年的營運成本、（vi）去年繳付的隧道使用費總額、（vii）隧道使用費佔票價的比例，以及（viii）去年的營運盈餘或赤字（以表列出）；

（二）是否知悉，由本年一月至上月三十日，各專營巴士營運商向大欖隧道營辦商繳付的隧道使用費總額，以及自上月三十一日起，預計每月向專營巴士豁免隧道費基金存入的隧道使用費分別為何；及

（三）有否估計，自政府於上月三十一日收回大欖隧道後，各專營巴士營辦商每年可節省的隧道使用費分別為何；當局會否要求專營巴士營辦商將節省的隧道使用費直接全數回饋乘客；如會，預計行經大欖隧道的專營巴士路線的每程票價的減幅為何；如否，原因為何，以及當局將如何推動該等營辦商推出其他車費優惠和穩定該等路線的票價，以紓緩乘客的負擔？

答覆：

主席：

專營巴士的車費是按由行政長官會同行政會議所批准的車費等級表釐定。個別巴士線車費標準取決於其所屬的路線組別，而路線組別主要以服務性質、路程長短作區分，而非該組別路線有否駛經收費隧道或道路。換言之，行經收費隧道或道路（如陸頌雄議員所指的大欖隧道）的專營巴士路線車費，與其駛經的隧道或道路的收費水平並不掛鉤。

就陸頌雄議員的提問，經諮詢運輸署後，現答覆如下：

（一）現時，九龍巴士（一九三三）有限公司（九巴）、龍運巴士有限公司及城巴有限公司（市區及新界巴士網絡專營權）共有超過50條行經大欖隧道的專營巴士路線。有關路線全程成人票價介乎11.5元至47.2元，全程行車車程介乎約16.4公里至61.4公里。在二○二四年，有關路線行經大欖隧道的實際班次數目為約112萬，乘客量約7 440萬人次。

專營巴士營辦商（營辦商）經營帳戶以整體的開支及收入計算，運輸署沒有備存個別巴士路線的營運成本、盈利或虧損的分項資料。上述三間營辦商二○二四年繳付大欖隧道的隧道使用費總額約2億4,000萬元。

（二）按二○二四年數字推算，營辦商二○二五年一月一日至五月三十日繳付大欖隧道的隧道使用費約1億元。

政府自二○一九年二月起豁免營辦商使用政府隧道及管制區的收費。各營辦商已設立其專用的基金帳目，即豁免隧道費基金（基金），存入所節省的隧道使用費。當營辦商申請加價而行政長官會同行政會議認為有足夠理據上調票價時，營辦商需先利用基金的結餘抵銷加幅。乘客所需承擔的車費加幅將會降低，讓乘客直接受惠。

當大欖隧道今年五月三十一日成為政府隧道後，單層巴士及雙層巴士的隧道使用費減至43元。營辦商需繳付的大欖隧道隧道使用費均會存入基金。按二○二四年數字推算，營辦商每月將需存入基金的有關款項為約400萬元，每年則約4,800萬元。

（三）按上述推算，營辦商每年少付的大欖隧道使用費約1億9,000萬元。但正如上文所述，各專營巴士線的車費取決於專營巴士的整體營運情況，而非取決於其駛經的隧道或道路的收費水平。事實上，隧道使用費支出佔專營巴士整體營運成本少於7%，個別隧道（包括大欖隧道）的使用費調低後對整體營運成本影響輕微。

政府一直把關專營巴士收費水平，於去年處理加價申請時，已特別考慮到營辦商因大欖隧道收費下調後，整體成本稍為下降的情況，同時透過基金盡量抵銷車費加幅。以九巴為例，在計及基金0.9個百分點的紓緩作用後，其票價的整體加幅由5.2%降低至4.3%。"
LCQ14: Franchised bus routes running through Tai Lam Tunnel,2025-06-11 14:45,2025-06-11 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100423.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Luk Chung-hung and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

There are views that, before the Government's takeover of Tai Lam Tunnel (TLT), the tolls for public single-decked buses and public double-decked buses using TLT were as high as $180 and $213 respectively, resulting in the fares of franchised bus routes running through TLT being significantly higher than those of other bus routes which do not run through TLT but have similar route lengths, ultimately adding to the financial burden of commuting on residents of Yuen Long District. With the takeover of TLT by the Government on 31st of last month, the toll for franchised buses has been substantially reduced to $43, and there should be room for downward adjustment of the fares of bus routes running through TLT. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the following information about the various franchised bus routes running through TLT: (i) the current adult full fares, (ii) the full mileage of the routes, (iii) the number of trips running through TLT last year, (iv) last year's patronage, (v) last year's operating costs, (vi) the total amount of tolls paid last year, (vii) the proportion of tolls to the fares and (viii) last year's operating surplus or deficit (set out in a table);

(2) whether it knows the total amount of tolls paid by various franchised bus operators to the operator of TLT from January to 30th of last month this year, as well as the respective estimated amounts of tolls to be kept in the Franchised Bus Toll Exemption Fund each month since 31st of last month; and

(3) whether it has estimated the respective annual savings in tunnel tolls to be achieved by various franchised bus operators since the Government took over TLT on 31st of last month; whether the authorities will require franchised bus operators to directly distribute the full amount of toll savings to passengers; if so, of the anticipated rate of reduction in the fares of each trip of the franchised bus routes running through TLT; if not, the reasons for that, and how the authorities will motivate such operators to introduce other fare concessions and stabilise the fares of such routes, so as to alleviate the burden on passengers?

Reply:

President,

The fares of franchised bus services are to be charged according to a scale of fares determined by the Chief Executive in Council. The fare level of individual bus routes depends on the route groups to which they belong, and the route groups are mainly distinguished by the nature of service and the length of journey, regardless of whether the routes in the group pass through tolled tunnels or roads. In other words, the fares of franchised bus routes passing through tolled tunnels or roads (such as the Tai Lam Tunnel referred to by the Hon Luk Chung-hung) are not linked to the toll levels of these tunnels or roads.

Having consulted the Transport Department (TD), our reply to the Hon Luk Chung-hung's questions is as follows:

(i)At present, the Kowloon Motor Bus Company (1933) Limited (KMB), Long Win Bus Company Limited and Citybus Limited (Franchise for the Urban and New Territories bus network) operate a total of over 50 franchised bus routes that pass through the Tai Lam Tunnel. The full adult fares of these routes range from $11.5 to $47.2, with the full journey distances ranging from approximately 16.4 kilometres to 61.4 kilometres. In 2024, the actual number of trips of these routes through the Tai Lam Tunnel was about 1.12 million, with a patronage of about 74.4 million.

The operating accounts of the franchised bus operators (the operators) are calculated on the basis of overall expenditure and revenue. The TD does not maintain a breakdown of the operating costs, profits or losses of individual bus routes. The amount of tolls of the Tai Lam Tunnel paid by the above three operators totalled about $240 million in 2024.

(ii) Based on the figures in 2024, it is estimated that the operators paid about $100 million for the tolls of the Tai Lam Tunnel from January 1 to May 30, 2025.

The Government has exempted the operators from paying tolls when using government tunnels and control areas since February 2019. The operators have kept the tolls saved in the dedicated fund accounts they set up, i.e. the Toll Exemption Funds (TEF). When an operator applies for a fare increase and the Chief Executive in Council considers that there is a justifiable need to increase the fare, the operator is required to offset the increase by first using the balance in TEF. The magnitude of the fare increase shouldered by passengers will be lowered, and the passengers will be benefitted directly.

After the Tai Lam Tunnel became a Government tunnel on May 31 this year, the tolls of single-decker buses and double-decker buses were reduced to $43. Tolls payable by the operators will be deposited into the TEF. Based on the figures in 2024, it is projected that the operators will need to deposit about $4 million per month and about $48 million per year into the TEF.

(iii) Based on the above projection, the operators will pay approximately $190 million less in the Tai Lam Tunnel tolls annually. That said, as mentioned above, the fares of franchised bus routes are dependent on the overall operating situation of the franchised buses rather than the toll levels of the tunnels or roads that they pass through. In fact, the toll expenses account for less than seven per cent of the overall operating costs of franchised buses. The reduction in tolls of individual tunnels (including the Tai Lam Tunnel) has a minimal impact on the overall operating costs.

The Government has all along been closely monitoring the fare levels of franchised buses. When processing the fare increase applications last year, the Government has specifically considered the slight reduction in overall costs for operators after the decrease in the Tai Lam Tunnel tolls. At the same time, the Government sought to mitigate the fare increase through the TEF as far as possible. In the case of KMB, the overall rate of fare increase was reduced from 5.2 per cent to 4.3 per cent after a 0.9 percentage points mitigation effect by the TEF."
立法會十二題：市區重建,2025-06-11 14:30,2025-06-11 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100469.htm,"​以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上楊永杰議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

市區重建局於二○二二年發布《油麻地及旺角地區研究資料手冊》，提出「地積比率轉移」（即容許將重建潛力有限的細小地盤（「輸出地盤」）的總樓面面積轉移至位於策略性位置的大型重建地盤（「接收地盤」））的新規劃工具，其後城市規劃委員會推出以旺角及油麻地為試點的「地積比率轉移先導計劃」（先導計劃），而旺角洗衣街／花墟道發展計劃為首個項目。另一方面，政府於本年三月十九日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，會探討跨區地積比率轉移的可行性（即將舊區重建項目中未用盡的地積比率，轉移到新發展區使用），以增加市場參與重建的誘因。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否參考先導計劃項目的經驗，容許發展商將位於旺角及油麻地以外的舊區小型重建地盤所未用盡的地積比率，轉移至同區或跨區的大型重建地盤使用；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；

（二）鑑於有意見指出，舊區土地的價值一般較新發展區為高，政府會否研究因應「輸出地盤」和「接收地盤」的呎價水平調整地積比率的轉移比例（例如呎價較低的新發展區地盤在接收呎價較高的舊區地盤的總樓面面積時，可獲較高倍數的地積比率），以吸引發展商參與重建；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）會否考慮規定「輸出地盤」須撥出部分土地作綠化地帶、休憩用地，以及政府、機構或社區用途；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

市區重建局（市建局）於二○二一年完成《油麻地及旺角地區研究》，提出多項建議和新規劃工具，包括試行同區地積比率轉移。為跟進此建議，城市規劃委員會於二○二三年七月發出規劃指引，在油旺兩區推行地積比率轉移先導計劃，容許將「輸出地盤」未用盡的地積比率轉移至同一分區計劃大綱圖內的「接收地盤」，以增加重建誘因。正如問題所指，市建局的旺角洗衣街／花墟道發展計劃是首個試行地積比率轉移的重建項目，該項目將數個分布零散及缺乏重建潛力的細小地盤內未用盡的地積比率，集中在一個較大的地盤上作混合用途發展，增加規劃裨益和項目商業效益。

為鼓勵及加快市區重建，發展局正進行政策研究，利用新開發土地推動大型舊區重建項目，包括跨區地積比率轉移，即有別於上述先導計劃的同區地積比率轉移，我們會考慮容許舊區「輸出地盤」未用盡地積比率跨區轉移至新發展區，亦同時減低舊區密度。我們會在今年內完成政策研究並提出初步建議。

就楊永杰議員提問的各部分，我現回覆如下：

（一）我們初步傾向將地積比率轉移擴展至油旺兩區以外的舊區，讓更多重建項目受惠。我們正就擴闊地區範圍進行分析，詳情會在今年內公布的初步建議交代。

（二）正如議員提到，舊區土地價值與新發展區不同，前者地價一般較後者高，因此其中一個設計關鍵是要處理跨區地價的差異，成效將視乎轉移至「接收地盤」的價值能否合理反映「輸出地盤」未用盡的地積比率的價值。與此同時，操作須簡單易行，為市場帶來確定性，亦避免無必要行政工作量。我們會從這些方向敲定建議。

（三）我們的目標是推動市建局及市場上持有舊樓的土地業權人進行重建，應對老舊樓宇的潛在風險及改善舊區情況，在平衡這政策目標和項目財務可行性的前提下，我們會在上述政策研究一併考慮應否規定「輸出地盤」需提供公共休憩空間及／或政府、社區及機構設施。"
LCQ12: Urban renewal,2025-06-11 14:30,2025-06-11 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100476.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Yang Wing-kit and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

The Urban Renewal Authority published in 2022 the District Study for Yau Ma Tei and Mong Kok – Information Booklet, which proposed a new planning tool called ""transfer of plot ratio"" (i.e. allowing the transfer of gross floor area from small sites with limited redevelopment potentials (""sending sites"") to sizable redevelopment sites at strategic locations (""receiving sites"")). Subsequently, the Town Planning Board launched a pilot scheme on transfer of plot ratio (the Pilot Scheme) with Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei as pilot areas, and the Sai Yee Street/Flower Market Road Development Scheme in Mong Kok is the first project. On the other hand, in the reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on March 19 this year, the Government indicated that it would study the feasibility of cross-district transfer of plot ratios (i.e. transferring the residual plot ratios of redevelopment projects in old districts for use in new development areas (NDAs)), so as to incentivise market participation in redevelopment. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will draw on the experience of projects under the Pilot Scheme to allow developers to transfer the residual plot ratios of small redevelopment sites in old districts other than Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei for use in sizeable redevelopment sites in the same district or in other districts; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) given that there are views pointing out that the value of land in old districts is generally higher than that in NDAs, whether the Government will study adjusting the plot ratio to be transferred based on the price per square foot of the ""sending and receiving sites"" (e.g. ‍allowing a higher plot ratio for sites in NDAs with lower prices per square foot when receiving gross floor area from sites in old districts with higher prices per square foot), so as to attract developer participation in redevelopment; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it will consider requiring that a portion of land from the ""sending sites"" be allocated for Green Belt, Open Space, and Government, Institution or Community uses; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Urban Renewal Authority (URA) completed the District Study for Yau Ma Tei and Mong Kok in 2021, which put forward a number of recommendations and new planning tools, including a pilot scheme for transfer of plot ratio (TPR) within the same district. To follow up on this recommendation, the Town Planning Board promulgated guidelines for the pilot scheme on TPR for Yau Mong Districts in July 2023, allowing the transfer of unutilised plot ratio from sending site(s) (SS) to receiving site(s) (RS) within the same Outline Zoning Plan to enhance redevelopment incentives. As mentioned in the question, the URA's Sai Yee Street/Flower Market Road Development Scheme in Mong Kok is the first pilot redevelopment project to adopt TPR, which consolidated and transferred the unutilised plot ratio of several small and scattered sites without redevelopment potential to a larger site for mixed development, so as to enhance planning gains and the commercial viability of the project.

To encourage and expedite urban renewal, the Development Bureau is conducting a policy study to examine the use of newly developed land to drive large-scale urban redevelopment projects, including cross-district TPR. Unlike the above-mentioned pilot scheme on TPR within the same district, we will consider allowing cross-district transfer of unutilised plot ratio from the SS to new development areas, and reducing the density of old districts. We will complete the policy study and put forward preliminary recommendations within this year.

My reply to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Yang Wing-kit is as follows:

(1) Our preliminary view is to extend TPR to old districts other than Yau Mong Districts, so that more redevelopment projects can benefit. We are conducting an analysis on expanding the coverage of districts. Details will be provided when announcing preliminary recommendations within this year.

(2) As mentioned by the Member, the land value in old districts is different from that in new development areas, with the former typically higher than the latter. Therefore, one of the key design challenges is to address the land value difference across districts. The effectiveness will depend on whether the value transferred to the RS can reasonably reflect the value of the unutilised plot ratio at the SS. Meanwhile, the mechanism should be simple and easy to implement, providing market certainty and avoiding unnecessary administrative burden. We will finalise the recommendations along such directions.

(3) Our goal is to encourage the URA and landowners holding old buildings in the market to take forward redevelopment in order to address the potential risks associated with ageing structures and improve the conditions of old districts. Premised on a balance between this policy objective and the project financial viability, we will also consider in the above policy study whether requirements to provide public open spaces and/or government, community, and institutional facilities should be imposed on the SS."

主席：

就陳月明議員的提問，經諮詢教育局後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）過去三年，康樂及文化事務署（康文署）轄下陸上各主要的體育設施在繁忙時段的使用情況載於附件一。

（二）為推動更多市民參與運動，康文署一直以多管齊下的方式提升不同類型的體育及康樂設施，以促進體育的發展。

康文署正積極推展「提升足球場設施五年計劃」，以提供更多符合國際標準的足球場。截至二○二五年四月底，已開展的61項工程項目中，有59個項目已經完成。康文署會繼續與相關的工程部門研究進行其他改善工程的技術可行性，逐步落實其他改善工程計劃，以促進香港的足球發展。

同時，康文署正推進「體育及康樂設施五年計劃」和「體育及康樂設施十年發展藍圖」，當中包括41項工程項目。截至目前，已開展的25項工程項目中，有13個項目已經完成／部分完成。另外，16個項目的可行性研究已完成或正在籌備中。我們正審視規劃中的工程項目的緩急優次，以更有效運用公共資源，持續規劃新的體育及康樂設施和改善現有設施。

此外，康文署亦會與其他政府部門一同規劃和推展工程項目，以增加和提升現有體育及康樂設施。以剛於二○二五年四月啓用的粉嶺安樂門街遊樂場為例，在重置工程後的滑板場已提升至達到國際標準的場地。

康文署將繼續增加和改善體育及康樂設施，以滿足市民的需求，並建立熱愛體育的文化。

Question:

While the Government has indicated that it has all along been committed to promoting ""Sports for All"", there are views pointing out that there has been a persistent short supply of sports venues of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), and in particular, popular sports facilities such as badminton courts and basketball courts are in high demand. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective usage rates of the LCSD's major sports facilities in various districts during peak hours (i.e. at or after 6pm from Mondays to Fridays, and any time on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) in the past three years;

(2) whether the LCSD has short, medium and long-term plans in place to increase the number of sports facilities in the community to encourage more members of the public to participate in sports; if so, of the plans; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) given that the Government launched the ""Opening up School Facilities for Promotion of Sports Development Scheme"" (the Scheme) in 2017 to encourage schools to open up their school facilities for leasing to sports organisations, of the implementation situation of the Scheme in the past year, including the number of schools participating in the Scheme, the total number of occasions in which and duration for which the facilities were leased out, as well as the total amount of subsidies disbursed; and

(4) as there are views that at present, the Scheme is exclusively available for facility rentals by specific sports organisations and limits its ability to benefit more members of the public, whether the Government will gradually open up the eligibility criteria of the Scheme to allow more community groups (e.g. District Council members and the District Services and Community Care Teams) to use the facilities, as well as study the feasibility of opening up school facilities for booking by members of the public through the LCSD's intelligent sports and recreation services booking and information system ""SmartPLAY"", thereby increasing the provision of sports venues in various districts in the long run; if so, of the specific plan and timetable; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Education Bureau, the reply to the questions raised by the Hon Chan Yuet-ming is as follows:

(1) The usage rate of major land-based sports facilities under the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) during peak hours in the past three years are at Annex 1.

(2) To encourage broader public participation in sports, the LCSD has been adopting a multi-pronged approach to enhance different types of sports and recreation facilities to promote sports development.

The LCSD is actively implementing the five-year plan for upgrading football pitches to provide more football pitches meeting international standards. As at end-April 2025, out of the 61 works projects commenced, 59 were completed. The LCSD will continue to work with relevant works departments to conduct technical feasibility study for other improvement projects for gradual implementation with a view to promoting the development of football in Hong Kong.

Meanwhile, the LCSD is implementing the Five-Year Plan for Sports and Recreation Facilities and the 10-Year Development Blueprint for Sports and Recreation Facilities, which include 41 works projects. So far, out of the 25 projects commenced, 13 have been completed or partially completed. In addition, technical feasibility studies for 16 projects have been completed or are in preparation. We are reviewing the order of priority of the works projects under planning with a view to using the public resources more effectively to plan for new sports and recreation facilities and improve existing ones continuously.

Besides, the LCSD plans and takes forward works projects in collaboration with other government departments to increase and improve existing sports and recreation facilities. For instance, the re-provisioned skateboard ground at the On Lok Mun Street Playground in Fanling, which opened in April 2025, has been upgraded to meet the relevant international standards.

The LCSD will continue to increase and improve sports and recreation facilities with a view to meeting the demand of the public and fostering a strong sporting culture.

(3) The data for the ""Opening up School Facilities for Promotion of Sports Development Scheme"" is as follows:




2023/24 school year


Number of participating schools
225


Numberof schools paired with sports organisations
116


Numberof programmes
535


Total duration of programmes (Note)
12 840 hours


Total amount of subsidies disbursed
$15.56 million



Note: Calculated on the basis that the 535 programmes successfully held in the school year have each accessed the relevant facilities for a cumulative total of 24 hours at minimum in the school year.

(4) The Government encourages schools to open up their facilities for outside sports organisations to hold sports programmes after school hours through the ""Opening up School Facilities for Promotion of Sports Development Scheme"". To ensure that the sports organisations have the capability to effectively conduct sports programmes at schools, the Scheme is currently opened for National Sports Associations recognised by the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China and their affiliated club members, district sports associations, and sports organisations subvented by the LCSD. Other organisations that are interested in participating in the Scheme and meeting the specific criteria (see Annex 2) may also apply to the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau for participation.

The main purpose of school premises is for students to learn and engage in extracurricular activities. Opening up school facilities to all organisations and/or members of the public would involve complicated administrative arrangements. In addition to management, security, health, and liability insurance concerns, many schools are concerned about the additional costs arising from opening up school facilities. The Education Bureau has been encouraging schools to assume social responsibility by opening up, as far as practical, their school facilities and premises to public groups. However, given that the education sector remains conservative about opening up school facilities to all organisations and/or members of the public, the Government has no plan to open up school facilities to all organisations and/or members of the public for direct bookings at this stage."

梁君彥主席（立法會主席）、李卓廣醫生（香港紅十字會輸血服務中心行政及醫務總監）、各位立法會議員、各位傳媒朋友：

很開心今日來到立法會大樓參與立法會議員的捐血推廣活動。我首先今日精心挑選了這條領帶，因為今日捐血，紅色是今日的主題。很多人一聽到捐血，便會覺得自己「蝕底」去幫人、捨己為人。不過想跟大家說，其實捐血不是真的「蝕底」，應該不僅沒有「蝕底」，甚至是「有着數」。為甚麼呢？我用醫學角度來說明為何沒有「蝕底」。其實人的血液可以說是「產能有剩」，不是「過剩」，我們不會說過多的，不過確實身體的造血能力是有剩的，而我們血液內的紅血球，其實在我們身體中是「過客」，它大概發揮功能約120日，身體便會把它回收。換句話說，它不是直到永遠的。而另一方面很重要的是，我們的身體有很強的造血能力，捐血後兩至三個星期，身體的骨髓造血功能便會把血造回來。所以，捐血後不會令自己少了些東西，其實是把自己產能有剩的一個很寶貴的資源，因為血液沒有替代品，幫助其他的人。所以，第一是沒有「蝕底」的，那些只是身體都會回收的。

為何說「有着數」呢？其實捐血對身體真的是「有着數」。捐血會刺激身體的新陳代謝，增加血液循環，即是一些稍為舊的血液，我們捐血後，身體會製造一些更新的血液，對新陳代謝，以至血液循環是有幫助的，在某程度上亦會增強我們的免疫力。更重要的是，捐血救人對我們心理精神健康有幫助，因為捐血者會有一份強烈的滿足感、幸福感。捐一次血救三個人，大家想一想都開心、想一想都有滿足感、幸福感。所以，我相信今日大家捐血後，精神會特別健康、心理特別滿足，可能晚上睡覺都會睡得好些，或者開心到睡着都會笑醒。

剛才主席說多謝我來，其實我覺得不用多謝我，應該是我多謝你們。我代表醫療衞生界、代表紅十字會，更重要的是代表香港需要接受輸血的病人，我在此衷心感謝立法會議員以身作則，因為憑着他們的地位、影響力，我相信他們的行動可以鼓勵香港市民參與這個很有意義的活動。

最後，我要再強調，捐血救人「有着數、無蝕底」。祝大家身心健康。多謝。"

Question:

In the 2017 Policy Address, the Government proposed the ""Five-Year Plan for Sports and Recreation Facilities"" to launch 26 projects to develop new and improve existing sports and recreation facilities. However, the Government indicated in its reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on the Estimates of Expenditure 2025-2026 that four out of such 26 ‍projects are still under planning. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) in respect of the aforesaid four projects still under planning, of (i) the dates when they were proposed, and (ii) the time lag to date since their proposal (set out in a table);

(2) as the Government has advised that among the aforesaid four projects, the project of Sports Ground and Open Space with Public Vehicle Park in Area 16, Tuen Mun (TMA16 Project) can only proceed after the depots of two franchised bus companies currently at the site concerned are relocated, and that the Government will actively co-ordinate in expediting the implementation of the depot relocation plans for the two franchised bus companies, of the latest progress of the relevant work, and how the Government will push forward the commencement of the TMA16 Project; and

(3) whether it will consider proceeding to tendering for the engagement of engineering consultants for the TMA16 Project as the first step, so as to kick-start the engineering design and submission of the planning applications as early as possible, thereby compressing the overall timeline of the project; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Government announced in the 2017PolicyAddress the ""Five-Year Plan for Sports and Recreation Facilities"" with a view to commencing 26projects to increase and improve sports and recreation facilities. Among which, 13 projects have been opened or partially opened for public use while four projects are still under planning. Having consulted the relevant policy bureaux and departments, my reply to the questions raised by the HonHoldenChow is set out below:

(1) In order to make optimal use of land resources, the Government announced in the 2018 Policy Address that the principle of ""single site, multiple uses"" would be adopted when implementing public works projects. In view of the public demand for parking spaces in the relevant districts, the Government has proposed to incorporate public vehicle parks into four sports and recreation facility projects under planning to meet the public needs for sports and recreation facilities and alleviate the demand for parking spaces in the districts concerned. The latest progress of the four projects is set out below:




Project
Date of obtaining support from the District Council (DC) upon revision of the proposed project facilities
Number of years since the date of obtaining support from the DC and current progress (up to 2025)


Sports Ground and Open Space with Public Vehicle Park in Area 16, Tuen Mun (TMA16 Project)
Support was obtained from Tuen Mun DC in February 2019


Around six years
The relevant site is currently used for several temporary purposes, including bus depots of the Kowloon Motor Bus Company (1933) Limited (KMB) and the Citybus Limited (Citybus), the Tuen Mun Training Ground and Testing Centre of the Construction Industry Council, as well as a fee-paying public vehicle park. The two bus companies have preliminarily identified new sites and submitted their applications for short-term tenancy (STT) to the Lands Department with a view to relocating their bus depots and returning the site for taking forward the project.




Football-cum-Rugby Pitch with Public Vehicle Park in Area 33, TaiPo
			
Support was obtained from Tai Po DC in November 2018.
			
			


Around six years
The Government consulted the DC about the conceptual design of the project on September 4,2024.
""Design and build"" (D&B) model will be adopted for the project. The Government will take the project forward in accordance with public works procedures.




Sports Facilities with Public Vehicle Park in Tung Tau Industrial Area, YuenLong
			
Support was obtained from Yuen Long DC in January 2019.
			
			


Around six years
D&B model will be adopted for the project. The Government will take the project forward in accordance with public works procedures.




Open Space with Public Vehicle Park in Area 17, TuenMun
			
Support was obtained from Tuen Mun DC in June 2019


Around six years
The Government has engaged a consultant to undertake the design and planning applications for the project.






The Government will continue to review the order of priority of works projects under planning and update their works schedules as appropriate for using public resources more effectively.

(2) Regarding the TMA16 Project, relevant government departments have been actively assisting franchised bus operators in identifying sites for relocating the bus depots so as to vacate the site early for taking forward the project. Both the KMB and Citybus have submitted STT applications to the Lands Department for the use of government sites at the southern and northern ends of Ho Wo Street respectively for relocating the bus depots currently located at Area 16, Tuen Mun. The site at the southern end of Ho Wo Street was handed over to the KMB in March 2025. The KMB will carry out site formation and associated works as soon as practicable to expedite the commencement of the new bus depot thereat.

As for the site at the northern end of Ho Wo Street which Citybus has applied for, its underground drainage facilities pose certain technical constraints on the use of the land, including the feasibility of setting up petrol stations and vehicle-washing machines at the site. In this regard, relevant government departments are actively liaising with Citybus and exploring possible solutions. Upon the granting of STT, Citybus will commence the preparatory work for relocating its bus depot.

Relevant bureaux and departments will continue to co-ordinate and assist the two bus companies in the relocation exercise to ensure that the bus depots can be moved out and the site can be cleared as soon as practicable. Meanwhile, other preparatory work will continue to be carried out so that the works can be commenced immediately after the tender exercise is completed and funding approval is obtained from the Finance Committee of the Legislative Council.

(3) To implement the TMA16 Project, the Government will adopt the D&B model under which bids for design works and building works will be invited under a single contract. The successful contractor is required to engage construction and design teams to carry out detailed design for the project simultaneously to shorten the overall construction period as well as make best use of its expertise and experience on building materials and construction techniques to enhance the design quality and cost-effectiveness of the project."

LCQ3: 1823 Contact Centre,2025-06-11 12:53,2025-06-11 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100443.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Joephy Chan and a reply by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

 Last year, the Government optimised the services of the 1823 Contact Centre by fully introducing artificial intelligence (AI) technology to enhance its effectiveness. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the current respective ratios of application of AI technology in the various service aspects of the 1823 Contact Centre, such as case triage, automated responses and handling of citizens' voicemail messages and enquiries;

(2) of the respective numbers and proportions of cases in which the handling was directly completed by the 1823 AI chatbot and those which required referral to staff for handling in the past 12 months; the respective numbers and proportions of citizens who opted for the 1823 self-service options (e.g. AI chatbot service) and those who chose to contact hotline staff directly in the past 12 months; whether a survey has been conducted on citizens' overall satisfaction with the 1823 AI chatbot service; and

(3) as it is learnt that Beijing has deepened its reform of immediate public complaint processing in order to implement the people-centred concept by adopting a ""precise classification and intelligent assignment"" mechanism to enhance the overall capacity of the Beijing 12345 citizen hotline for processing public complaints, whether the Government will draw upon such experience to further utilise technologies such as big data to optimise 1823 services and extend their application to non-telephone channels such as email and mobile applications, so as to comprehensively enhance service efficiency and address livelihood issues, thereby strengthening citizens' sense of fulfilment, happiness and security; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 My consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Joephy Chan is as follows:

 Operated by the Digital Policy Office, the 1823 one-stop platform provides 24-hour cross-departmental customer service to help answer public enquiries about the services of 23 government bureaux/departments (B/Ds), and receive complaints and service requests for all B/Ds. In addition to telephone hotline, citizens can now use 1823 service through channels such as mobile app, website, email and e-form. In 2024, the total usage volume of 1823 reached 7.55million.

 Generally speaking, upon receipt of public enquiries or complaints from various channels, 1823 will classify them into two broad types for processing. For public enquiries concerning participating B/Ds, 1823 will answer them directly; for complaints regarding government services, 1823 will refer them to the relevant B/Ds for relevant follow-up.

 Currently, 1823 has widely adopted artificial intelligence (AI) and other innovative technologies in various service areas to make its work process more automated and smart. These measures include:

(1) At the case triage stage, 1823 employs AI speech recognition technology and algorithms to analyse the content of citizens' incoming calls and written submissions, automatically assigning cases to staff familiar with the respective subject matter, thereby enhancing work efficiency. For cases that require referral to other departments, 1823 also uses a business rule engine integrated with the Lands Department's geographic information platform to swiftly refer cases to designated units of relevant departments based on factors such as case nature, time and location;

(2)For written enquiries handled directly by 1823, we use generative AI technology to assist 1823 staff in drafting responses, thereby enhancing the case processing speed;

(3)1823 adopts AI speech-to-text technology to transcribe voice messages into text and thus expedite the work process; and

(4)Since 2023, 1823 has progressively introduced and enhanced self-service channels, including an AI chatbot, a smart interactive voice response system, and online self-service enquiry service. These channels handle citizens' general or common enquiries in real time, while allowing resources to be focused on more complicated cases.

  The above measures demonstrate that we have integrated AI into the major operational areas of 1823 to enhance the efficiency of case intake, triage, referral, handling and resolution. The proportion of citizens using the related smart services has also increased.

  In 2023, the usage volume of 1823 digital self-services was nearly 3.9million, surpassing traditional manual services (i.e. calls, emails, e-forms, text messages, etc, that require manual processing) for the first time. The usage volume of self-services continued to increase by 10 per cent to 4.26million times in 2024, which accounted for about 56 per cent of total. Taking the 1823 AI chatbot as an example, it now handles over 10000 enquiries monthly, which is a two-fold increase compared to 2023, with a resolution rate of over 90 per cent.

  The effectiveness of technological applications in enhancing 1823 service performance is also reflected in our customer satisfaction survey. On a five-point scale, the 1823's overall customer satisfaction score in 2024 was 4.60, up from 4.56 in 2023 and 4.52 in 2022.

  The enhancement of 1823 service will continue. We will further strengthen the 1823 mechanisms for case classification, triage and referral, focusing on operational data analysis and case handling process. In addition, we will further expand the use or trial of AI in different service areas and interfaces. For example, we will use AI to capture case information from emails for inputting to the case management system; provide digital self-service for case progress tracking; and enhance the question-answering capabilities of chatbot, etc, to improve operational efficiency and user experience.

  Thank you, President."

答覆：

主席：

就陳穎欣議員的提問，我現綜合回覆如下：

由數字政策辦公室營運的1823一站式平台，提供24小時跨部門客戶服務，協助解答市民就23個政府決策局及部門（局／部門）服務的查詢，並接收市民對所有局／部門的投訴或服務要求。除電話熱線外，現時市民可透過流動應用程式、網站、電郵及電子表格等渠道使用1823服務。二○二四年，1823的整體服務量高達755萬次。

一般而言，1823從各個渠道收到市民的查詢或投訴後，會概括分為兩個類別處理──就市民對參與部門的查詢，1823會直接解答；而市民對政府服務的投訴，1823則會轉介至相關部門以專門跟進。

現時，1823已在各個服務環節廣泛使用人工智能技術及其他創新科技，使工作流程更自動化、更智能化，措施包括：

（一）在個案分流階段，1823使用人工智能語音識別技術及演算法，分析市民的來電及其他以文字提交的內容，自動分流個案至熟悉所涉範疇的職員處理，提高工作效率。就需要轉介部門的個案，1823亦採用業務規則引擎，結合地政總署的地理資訊平台，根據個案性質、時間、地點等因素，迅速轉介個案至相關部門的指定單位；

（二）就1823直接處理的書面查詢，我們會利用生成式人工智能技術，協助1823職員草擬回覆，提升個案處理速度；

（三）1823採用了人工智能語音轉文字技術，將語音留言轉為文字，加快工作流程；及

（四）自二○二三年起，1823逐步提供及加強人工智能聊天機械人、具備人工智能語音識別功能的智能化互動電話，以及網上自助查詢等數碼自助服務渠道，實時處理市民的一般或常見查詢，並讓資源集中於較複雜個案。

由此可見，我們在1823的主要工作環節中已引入不同的人工智能技術，以提升個案接收、分流、轉介、處理及解決的效能。市民利用相關智能服務的比例亦有所上升。

在二○二三年，1823數碼自助服務的使用量接近390萬次，首次超越人工服務（即需要人手處理的來電、電郵、電子表格及短訊等），而該比率在二○二四年繼續增加一成，佔整體服務總額約56%，即高達426萬次。以1823人工智能聊天機械人為例，現時每月解答超過一萬個查詢，較二○二三年上升兩倍，即時解答率超過九成。

相關科技應用對提升1823服務表現的成效，亦反映在滿意度調查中方面。以5分為滿分，1823在二○二四年的整體客戶滿意度評分為4.60分，較二○二三年的4.56分及二○二二年的4.52分為高。

優化1823服務的工作將持續進行。我們會繼續針對營運數據分析及個案處理流程，進一步加強1823個案分類、分流及轉介等機制，以及在不同環節及介面更廣泛使用或試行人工智能技術，例如，來年我們會從電郵中智能擷取個案資料並自動連接個案管理系統、提供個案進度的數碼自助查詢服務，以及加強聊天機械人的解答能力等，以提升營運效率及用戶體驗。

​立法會一題：路旁停車位,2025-06-11 12:43,2025-06-11 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100220.htm,"​以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上李浩然議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

有不少市民反映，在泊車位不足的情況下，各區的路旁停車位被部分商鋪長期佔用或以物品霸佔，利用該等泊車位進行商業活動。有意見認為，該等情況有違設立停車收費錶以防止車輛長時間停泊和佔用路面的原意，違反了公平使用公共資源的原則，更影響市民駕車出行的便利性。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，政府採取了甚麼措施打擊長期非法佔用路旁停車位的行為，以及有關的執法情況為何；

（二）鑑於有意見指出，商戶長期佔用或以物品霸佔路旁停車位的情況已在各區存在多年，政府有何具體措施加強打擊該等行為；及

（三）鑑於據悉，現時有內地城市採用車牌辨識系統，通過裝設感應器識別泊車位中的車輛以協助執法，當局會否考慮在路旁停車位引入類似系統或其他創新科技裝置，以協助執法部門打擊包括長期佔用、以物品霸佔、進行商業活動等非法佔用路旁停車位的行為？

答覆：

主席：

​政府的政策是以公共交通為本，鼓勵市民盡量使用公共交通服務，以免過多私家車加劇路面交通的負荷。因應駕車市民和商用車輛對泊車位的需求，政府過去幾年積極推展一系列短期及中長期措施，在情況許可下增加泊車位供應。在過去三年，收費錶停車位（咪錶位）增加超過2 300個。就李浩然議員提問的各個部分，經諮詢運輸署和警務處後，我的綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（二）政府一直致力打擊非法霸佔咪錶位的情況，遏制不付費泊車以及以其他方式非法佔用咪錶位，以加快咪錶位的流轉，滿足駕駛者短期泊車需要的目的。警務處透過巡查，對沒有繳費入錶的地點採取執法行動，並且於地區層面與有關部門如運輸署保持密切聯繫，持續監察。自二○二一年起投入使用的新一代咪錶系統配備感應器，可實時偵測泊車位有否被佔用，以及讓運輸署透過後台電腦系統識別未有付費的咪錶位，並可通過專用應用程式與警務處分享資訊，協助執法。具體操作來說，運輸署委聘的咪錶營辦商將咪錶感應器偵測到正被使用而未有付款的泊車位資料交予警務處跟進，亦派員定期巡查各區的咪錶，如發現咪錶位被不當佔用，營辦商會將情況向有關政府部門如警務處、地政總署及食物環境衞生署通報，以便採取執法行動。現時營辦商會每日巡查，向警務處轉介未有繳付咪錶費的個案，每年平均約12萬宗，而向警務處及其他相關部門轉介以非車輛物品佔用泊車位的個案，在過去三年間亦增至200宗以上。運輸署亦會在接獲市民投訴後，要求相關部門採取適當的跟進行動。此外，警務處會繼續宣傳和教育工作。由二○二一年至二○二四年期間，咪錶位增加超過10%，而咪錶所收取的泊車費增幅則超過四成；駕駛人士未有付費泊車的情況有所改善。

打擊以其他方式非法佔用咪錶位方面，根據《簡易程序治罪條例》第4A條，任何人無合理解釋留下東西，例如放置卡板／店鋪貨物霸位，而對在公眾地方的人或車輛造成阻礙、不便或危害，可處第四級罰款，即25,000元，或監禁三個月。

（三）如上述提及，新一代咪錶系統配備感應器，可實時偵測泊車位的使用狀況。現時有關系統收集資訊的目的，是向駕駛者提供實時空置路旁泊車位地點，並未具備辨識車輛車牌號碼的功能。

即使如此，有關資訊已有助警務處和運輸署掌握佔用咪錶位而未繳費的情況，以便警務處作出重點執法行動。部門會繼續參考其他地方的經驗和相關科技的發展，積極研究引進新技術以提升咪錶位的管理和應用效率；運輸署已計劃於今年第四季，在咪錶位需求較大、非法佔用咪錶比率較高的地點，進行為期兩個月的試點計劃，測試人工智能感光元件，並視乎成效進一步推展計劃。至於車牌辨識系統技術，運輸署持開放態度，並會研究系統的可靠性，連同更新咪錶系統硬件和軟件的成本效益一併考慮對香港的適用性。

多謝主席。"
LCQ1: On-street parking spaces,2025-06-11 12:43,2025-06-11 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100221.htm,"  âFollowing is a question by Dr the Hon Hoey Simon Lee and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

  Many members of the public have relayed that under the circumstances of a lack of parking spaces, some businesses are occupying on-street parking spaces in various districts on a long-term basis or blocking them with objects in order to use such parking spaces for commercial activities. There are views that such practices defeat the original purpose of installing parking meters to prevent prolonged parking and occupation of road space by vehicles, violate the principle of fair use of public resources, and adversely affect motorists' convenience when going out. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the measures taken by the Government in the past three years to combat the illegal long-term occupation of on-street parking spaces, and the relevant enforcement situation;

(2) as there are views pointing out that the long-term occupation of on-street parking spaces or their blockage with objects by businesses has existed in various districts for many years, what specific measures the Government has in place to step up efforts in combatting such practices; and

(3) as it is learnt that at present, some Mainland cities have implemented number plate recognition systems by installing sensors to identify vehicles in parking spaces to assist with enforcement, whether the authorities will consider introducing similar systems or other innovative technological devices at on-street parking spaces to assist law enforcement agencies in combatting the illegal occupation of on-street parking spaces, including long-term occupation, blockage with objects and holding of commercial activities?

Reply:

President,

It is the Government's policy to centre on public transport, and the Government encourages the public to make good use of the public transport services as far as possible, so as to avoid aggravating the burden on road traffic resulting from excessive private cars (PCs). In response to the parking demand for both PCs and commercial vehicles, over the past years, the Government has been actively pursuing a host of short-term and medium-to-long-term measures, to increase the supply of parking spaces where circumstances permit. Over the past three years, the number of metered parking spaces (metered spaces) has increased by more than 2 300. Having consulted the Transport Department (TD) and the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), a consolidated reply in response to the questions raised by Dr the Hon Hoey Simon Lee is as follows:

(1) and (2) The Government has all along been combatting the illegal occupation of metered spaces, deterring fare evasion and other forms of illegal use, to enhance turnover and ensure these spaces meet short-term parking needs. The HKPF conducts inspections and takes enforcement actions against unpaid parking, and maintains close co-ordination with relevant departments, such as the TD, at the district level for ongoing monitoring. Since 2021, the new-generation parking meter system, equipped with sensors, can detect real-time occupancy and enable the TD to identify unpaid metered spaces through its backend computer system. The TD shares this information with the HKPF via a dedicated application to facilitate enforcement. In terms of actual operation, the meter operator engaged by the TD provides information of unpaid but occupied metered spaces detected by the meters' sensors to the HKPF for follow-up, and dispatches personnel to regularly patrol parking meters in various districts. If any unlawful occupation of metered spaces is observed, the contractor will report the situation to relevant departments (for example, the HKPF, the Lands Department and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department) for enforcement. Currently, the contractor conducts daily inspections, and refers an average of about 120 000 cases per year to the HKPF for non-payment of parking fees, and the number of referrals concerning parking spaces occupied by non-vehicle items to the HKPF and other relevant departments has risen over the past three years to over 200 cases. The TD also refers public complaints to the appropriate authorities for action. Additionally, the HKPF continues its public awareness and education efforts. Between 2021 and 2024, the number of metered spaces increased by over 10 per cent, while revenue from metered parking fees rose by more than 40 per cent, suggesting improved compliance with paid parking regulations.

Regarding enforcement against other forms of illegal occupation, section 4A of the Summary Offences Ordinance stipulates that anyone who leaves objects in a public place – such as pallets/shop goods to reserve spaces - without reasonable excuse, causing obstruction, inconvenience, or danger to others or vehicles, is liable to a Level 4 fine ($25,000) or three months' imprisonment.

(3)As mentioned above, the new generation parking meter system is equipped with sensors to detect the usage status of parking spaces in real time. The purpose of collecting information is to provide motorists with locations of vacant on-street parking spaces in real time, and does not have the function of identifying number plate numbers.

Having said that, this information could assist the HKPF and the TD in identifying cases where metered spaces are occupied without payment, enabling targeted enforcement actions by the HKPF. The departments will continue to draw on experiences from other places and advancements in relevant technologies, actively exploring the adoption of new technologies to enhance the management and operational efficiency of metered spaces. The TD plans to conduct a two-month pilot scheme in the fourth quarter of 2025, adopting artificial intelligence sensors in targeted areas with greater demand for metered spaces and higher rates of illegal occupation of parking spaces. Depending on the success of the trial, we will expand the coverage of the scheme. Regarding number plate recognition systems, the TD remains open-minded and will assess their reliability alongside the cost-effectiveness of upgrading the meter system's hardware and software holistically to determine their suitability for application in Hong Kong.

Thank you, President."

答覆：

主席：

就陳勇議員的提問，現回覆如下：

大熊貓安安及可可自二○二四年十二月八日正式於海洋公園的香港賽馬會四川奇珍館與公眾見面，其後大熊貓龍鳳胎寶寶加加和得得於二○二五年二月十六日正式於公園「大熊貓之旅」與公眾見面，市民和旅客的反應熱烈，至今公園的入場人次比去年同期增加約19%。連同大熊貓盈盈和樂樂，香港大熊貓家庭為公園帶來不少門券及商品消費等收入。海洋公園公司二○二四至二五年度的整體財務表現，包括該年度的門票、餐飲及商品消費總額，將於其二○二四至二五年度業績報告內公布。

文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）自二○二四年九月起聯同香港旅遊發展局（旅發局）及海洋公園，與城中不同界別攜手舉辦以「召集世界好友暢遊香港」為主題的一系列宣傳活動，由香港大熊貓家庭擔當香港旅遊大使角色，介紹香港「無處不旅遊」的旅遊體驗，吸引世界各地旅客到訪香港，推動旅遊業發展。不同政策局／部門、旅遊業及社會相關界別亦因應文體旅局的積極推動推出多項以大熊貓為主題的宣傳及推廣項目。

上述的宣傳活動及項目已成功掀起全城的大熊貓熱潮，為各行各業創造條件，鼓勵他們發掘及抓緊商機，同時吸引更多旅客訪港。各區多個大型商場都展出大熊貓的裝飾及布置；餐飲業界推出不同的大熊貓造型產品；零售業界陸續推出各式各樣的大熊貓聯乘商品；香港鐵路有限公司聯乘海洋公園推出高鐵及機場快線車票及公園入場券的旅遊產品等。

海洋公園亦積極與不同品牌合作推出大熊貓主題的宣傳及商品，例如大熊貓造型金飾、飾物、文具、家庭用品、中式餅食、木雕、手機配件、紅酒、揮春利是封、以至汽車等。公園現時的大熊貓商品已經突破500款，是大熊貓寶寶出生前的四倍，而多款商品均大受歡迎，銷情理想。

此外，海洋公園自二○二五年二月十八日推出「大熊貓寶寶樂聚時光」活動，讓訪客於公園未開放的早晨時段率先入園，與大熊貓寶寶見面，每天的參加人數上限為40人，至今超過3 000人報名參加。同時，公園正舉辦不同的大熊貓工作坊如「大熊貓護理揭秘」、「大熊貓『便』利紙」和「窩窩頭工作室」，讓參加者透過親身體驗及觀察，了解大熊貓的身體特徵和習性，同時學懂保育大熊貓的知識，為市民和旅客帶來獨特的大熊貓體驗。預期上述活動及推廣會繼續刺激公園的入場人次、門券及商品消費等收入。

在推動熊貓旅遊進一步發展方面，文體旅局會繼續聯同旅發局、海洋公園及社會相關界別更好把握香港大熊貓家庭帶來的機遇，發揮創意，推出更多與大熊貓相關的宣傳活動及產品。文體旅局及旅發局亦全力支持由其他主辦機構舉辦以大熊貓為主題的大型活動，過去幾個月舉辦的活動，均深受市民及旅客歡迎。在剛過去的端午節期間，由旅發局主辦的龍舟嘉年華，當中內容包括「Panda Friends@香港海洋公園」端午主題打卡熱點，香港大熊貓家庭以端午節主題造型在尖沙咀星光大道亮相，讓遊客可以在維多利亞港美景前與大熊貓家族拍照打卡，同場亦設大熊貓期間限定店，發售多款大熊貓精品及節慶主題商品，兩者均深受市民和旅客歡迎。

文體旅局亦會繼續鼓勵海洋公園把握作為內地以外飼養最多大熊貓地方的優勢，推出更多具香港特色的大熊貓宣傳活動、商品、文創產品、動漫產品、電子遊戲及旅遊產品等，包括根據六隻大熊貓的外型特徵打造大熊貓商標（IP）的設計。除了廣泛應用相關IP於公園的社交媒體內容及產品外，公園會繼續利用相關IP於園內推出以大熊貓為主題的節慶活動、沉浸式體驗活動、光影匯演、主題表演、遊樂設施等。

本月的十五日是父親節，亦是樂樂成為父親後的第一個父親節，別具意義；而本月的二十六日及二十八日分別是可可和安安來港後的第一個生日，八月十五日則是加加和得得的一歲生日。文體旅局將會聯同旅發局和海洋公園推出新一浪的大熊貓宣傳活動，繼續為公園及各行各業創造條件，締造商機。

在大熊貓設施方面，為了讓大熊貓擁有一個更接近野生環境的棲息地，在安安和可可於二○二四年九月抵港前，海洋公園已向多間私人機構籌得共約900萬元，資助完成香港賽馬會四川奇珍館內第一階段的優化工程，包括添加攀爬架和植物等。此外，公園於二○二四年九月獲香港賽馬會慈善信託基金撥款1億2,100萬元進行升級工程，優化香港賽馬會四川奇珍館及「大熊貓之旅」，以提升館內的生態設施，為大熊貓提供優質、安全、適齡及更貼近大自然生態的居住環境。預計升級工程將於二○二五年第四季動工及二○二七年第二季完成。"

Question:

There are views that the official public debut of Hong Kong's first pair of locally born giant panda twins, elder sister Jia Jia and little brother De De, has sparked a new wave of ""panda fever"" in the city, which is currently home to six giant pandas, and the authorities should seize this opportunity to develop the panda tourism industrial chain, promote the growth of the panda tourism and related industries in Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) since Hong Kong became home to six giant pandas, whether the authorities have compiled statistics on the direct economic benefits they have brought to Ocean Park; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether the authorities have compiled statistics on the direct and indirect economic benefits brought to Hong Kong as a whole by the six giant pandas respectively (including the sales of panda merchandise and revenue growth across various trades and industries); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether the Government has further plans for the future to promote the healthy and sustainable development of the panda tourism and related industries in Hong Kong, e.g. Ocean Park's subsequent plans to optimize facilities and services, as well as budget arrangements, or plans to develop the panda tourism industrial chain in collaboration with various trades and industries; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The reply to the questions raised by the Hon Chan Yung is as follows:

The giant pandas An An and Ke Ke made their debut on December 8, 2024 at the Hong Kong Jockey Club Sichuan Treasures at Ocean Park, followed by the debut of the pigeon pair of giant panda twin cubs Jia Jia and De De on February 16, 2025 at the ""Giant Panda Adventure"" of the park. They have been well received by both locals and visitors, and Ocean Park's attendance has since then increased by around 19 per cent over the same period last year. Together with giant pandas Ying Ying and Le Le, the Hong Kong giant panda family has brought additional revenue to Ocean Park by way of admission tickets, merchandise, etc. The Ocean Park Corporation's overall financial performance for its Financial Year (FY) 2024-25, including the revenues on admission, food and beverages as well as merchandise in the same FY, will be reported in its 2024-25 Annual Report.

The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), jointly with the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) and Ocean Park, has collaborated with various parties in Hong Kong to organise a series of promotional activities themed ""Come and Enjoy a Pandastic Hong Kong"" since September 2024. The Hong Kong giant panda family has been serving as Hong Kong's tourism ambassadors to promote ""tourism is everywhere"" travel experience in Hong Kong, attracting visitors from around the world to Hong Kong and driving tourism development. As a result of CSTB's active promotion, different policy bureaux/departments, the tourism industry and related sectors have launched a number of promotional and marketing campaigns with the theme of giant pandas.

The above promotional events and initiatives have successfully sparked the craze for giant pandas across the city, creating favourable conditions for various trades and industries and encouraging them to explore and seize the business opportunities, as well as attracting more visitors to Hong Kong. A number of large shopping malls in various districts have displayed giant panda decorations and installations; the catering sector has introduced various giant panda design products; the retail sector has rolled out a variety of crossover products featuring giant pandas; and the MTR Corporation Ltd has collaborated with Ocean Park to offer tourism products bundling High Speed Rail and Airport Express tickets with Ocean Park admission tickets, etc.

  Ocean Park has also actively partnered with various brands to launch giant panda-themed promotions and merchandise, such as giant panda design jewellery, accessories, stationery, household products, Chinese snacks, wood carving items, mobile accessories, red wine, ""fai chuns"", red envelopes, cars. Currently, the number of giant panda-themed merchandise under Ocean Park's catalogue has exceeded 500, which is fourfold of the number before the giant panda cubs were born. Many items of the merchandise are well received and the sales performance is satisfactory.

Moreover, Ocean Park has launched ""A Treasured Moment with the Giant Panda Twins"" programme since February 18, 2025 to allow visitors to meet the giant panda cubs in the morning before the park opens, with a daily quota of 40 participants. The prgromme has so far attracted more than 3 000 enrolments. At the same time, Ocean Park is organising various giant panda workshops, such as ""Giant Panda Discovery"", ""Giant Panda Poo Paper Workshop"" and ""Wowotou Studio"", which allow the participants to learn about the physical features and habits of the giant pandas through hands-on experience and observation, as well as acquire knowledge of the conservation of giant pandas, thereby bringing a unique giant panda experience to both locals and visitors. It is anticipated that the above activities and promotions will continue to drive up Ocean Park's attendance and revenues from ticketing and merchandise, etc.

On promoting the further development of panda tourism, the CSTB will continue to work with the HKTB, Ocean Park and various sectors of the community to better seize the opportunities presented by the Hong Kong giant panda family and exercise creativity to launch more giant panda-related promotional activities and merchandise. The CSTB and the HKTB have also rendered full support for large-scale, giant panda-themed events hosted by other organisations. Those events organised in the past few months have garnered positive responses from locals and visitors. During the recent Dragon Boat Festival, the HKTB hosted the Dragon Boat Carnival featuring ""Panda Friends@Ocean Park Hong Kong"" festive photo spots. The Hong Kong giant panda family in festive costumes made their debut at the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui, allowing visitors to take photos with the giant panda family against the iconic backdrop of the Victoria Harbour. A pop-up store was also set up on site offering a great variety of giant panda-themed and festive merchandise. Both initiatives were well-received by the locals and visitors.

The CSTB will continue to encourage Ocean Park to capitalise on its advantage of being home to the largest number of giant pandas outside the Mainland by launching more Hong Kong-themed giant panda-related promotional activities, merchandise, cultural and creative products, comics and animation products, video games, tourism products, etc., including designs using the giant pandas intellectual property (IP) which were created according to the physical features of the six giant pandas residing in Hong Kong. In addition to the extensive use of the relevant IP in Ocean Park's social media contents and merchandise, Ocean Park will continue to make use of the relevant IP to launch giant panda-themed festive events, immersive experience activities, light shows, thematic performances, amusement facilities, etc.

The 15th of this month is Father's Day, which is also the first Father's Day for Le Le as a father and hence of special significance. Additionally, the 26th and the 28th of this month are the first birthdays of Ke Ke and An An respectively after their arrival in Hong Kong while August 15 is the one-year-old birthday of Jia Jia and De De. The CSTB together with the HKTB and Ocean Park will launch a new wave of giant panda promotions to keep creating favourable conditions and business opportunities for Ocean Park and different sectors.

As for the facilities for giant pandas, to provide the giant pandas with a habitat closely resembling the natural environment, Ocean Park completed the first phase of enhancement works in Hong Kong Jockey Club Sichuan Treasures before the arrival of An An and Ke Ke in September 2024, including addition of climbing frames, plants, etc., with sponsorships totalling about $9 million solicited from a number of private organisations. Furthermore, a funding of $121 million was received from the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust in September 2024 to take forward upgrading works for the Hong Kong Jockey Club Sichuan Treasures and the ""Giant Panda Adventure"". The existing ecological facilities will be enhanced to provide the giant pandas with a high-quality, safe and age-appropriate living environment that closely resembles the natural habitat. The upgrading works is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2025 and to complete in the second quarter of 2027."

Professor Greco (President of the ISSCR, Professor Valentina Greco), Mr Alm (Chief Executive Officer of the ISSCR, Mr Keith Alm), Professor Kathryn Cheah (2025 Annual Meeting Program Committee Co-Chair of the ISSCR), Professor Rocky Tuan (Lee Quo Wei and Lee Yick Hoi Lun Professor of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine of the Chinese University of Hong Kong), Professor Nancy Ip (President of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It gives me great honour to stand before you today as we kick off the ISSCR 2025 Annual Meeting here in Hong Kong, a city where East meets West, tradition meets innovation, and today, science meets the future.

  I still remember the pivotal moment in September 2022 when Kathryn, Nancy and Rocky approached me with a bold vision, that is, to bring this prestigious conference to Hong Kong. Without hesitation, I said, ""Let’s make it happen!"" And here we are, thanks to the relentless effort of the Bid Committee, the unwavering support of our three co-sponsoring universities, and of course the confidence that the ISSCR placed in us.

  I would like to thank the ISSCR for choosing Hong Kong as the host city for this very important meeting. Your decision speaks volumes. It is not just about our city's thriving biomedical ecosystem, but about its growing role as a global hub for scientific collaboration.

  Hong Kong is more than a skyline. It is a skyline of possibilities. We are moving full steam ahead to develop Hong Kong into an international innovation and technology centre and a leading hub for life and health sciences. Hong Kong has a solid foundation in biomedical research with a good number of world-acclaimed award-winning scientists, well-accredited research outputs, an excellent clinical research track record and the state-of-art research infrastructure.

  Our flagship R&D (research and development) initiative, InnoHK, exemplifies this commitment - bringing together over 30 world-renowned universities and research institutes from 12 economies, and setting up a total of 30 top-tier research labs. Sixteen of them are life science and health-related with many involving stem cell research in various dimensions, which are pushing boundaries every day.

  Stem cell research is not just a field, it is a frontier. It holds the promise of rewriting medicine, healing the incurable, and unlocking the deepest mysteries of human biology. Over the next four days, this gathering will allow ideas to be shared, partnerships to be forged and inspiration to be ignited. The discoveries made here will not only make an impact in Hong Kong, but will also ripple across the globe.

  As we stand at the forefront of stem cell research, a field that bridges the impossible and the inevitable, may I leave you with the words of Marie Curie, a pioneer who reshaped science: ""Nothing in life is to be feared; it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.""

  Ladies and gentlemen, let this conference be a testament to that understanding. Together, we are not just studying stem cells, but unlocking the future of medicine. May I wish the ISSCR 2025 Annual Meeting a resounding success, and everyone a wonderful stay in Hong Kong. Thank you."
立法會十五題：發展寵物相關產業,2025-06-11 12:15,2025-06-11 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100327.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上陳仲尼議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

據報，近年飼養寵物的家庭數目上升，寵物相關產業迅速發展。然而，有意見指出，本港在寵物醫療、寵物友善公共設施，以及寵物產業的數據管理及政策方面仍有進一步優化空間。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於據悉，不少私營商場已設立寵物通道及休憩區等人寵共融設施，以吸引寵物主人消費，從而進一步釋放寵物經濟潛力，香港房屋委員會會否參考有關經驗，在其轄下公共屋邨商場推行寵物友善措施；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）鑑於據報，台灣桃園市、新北市等地陸續設立公立或公益性質的寵物醫療機構，並提供收費透明的基本寵物醫療服務，不僅提升寵物的健康保障，亦推動寵物經濟，特區政府有否就設立公營或半公營寵物醫療設施展開研究或政策規劃；如有，詳情如何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為，備存寵物數據有助掌握寵物疫病風險，以及寵物產業的市場結構及潛力，政府會否設立全港性寵物數據管理平台，有系統地收集相關資訊（包括寵物數量、品種分布、飼養及疫苗接種紀錄，以及寵物疾病趨勢等），以為制訂寵物友善及發展寵物經濟政策提供科學依據；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就陳仲尼議員的提問，經諮詢房屋局，現回覆如下：

（一）隨着飼養寵物在本港越趨普遍，社會就攜帶動物進入不同場所和使用公共設施的關注亦日益增加。一般而言，政府在檢視是否進一步放寬現行安排時，需要考慮不同因素，包括個別設施的性質、配套是否到位、社會的接受程度等，以達致促進市民與動物和諧共處的政策目標。

香港房屋委員會（房委會）轄下商場主要為「鄰里商場」，設於公共屋邨／屋苑內，為當區居民提供購物便利，以照顧和配合居民日常生活的基本需要。一直以來，陪同視障人士的導盲犬在領路時可以進入房委會的商場。房委會亦已進一步推行一些寵物友善政策，例如若寵物被置於寵物袋或寵物手推車內而不構成任何衞生和環境滋擾，便可以進入商場。房委會會留意社會對寵物友善空間等設施的發展和需要，提供符合實際情況的「鄰里商場」設計。

另一方面，房委會位於油塘的大本型，屬大型區域商場，其室內空間寬敞、設有露天活動區域，以及有寬闊通道和多個位於不同位置的出入口，相比一般位於屋邨的「鄰里商場」更具條件發展為寵物友善商場。房委會會檢視是否適合在大本型進一步提供寵物友善措施，例如設置相關的人寵共融設施，以吸引飼養寵物人士前往消費和帶旺人流。

（二）漁農自然護理署（漁護署）透過公眾宣傳和教育，提醒市民在飼養寵物前必須謹慎思量，評估是否能履行飼養責任，滿足寵物在食物、住所和日常護理，以及醫療等方面的基本需求。

獸醫服務方面，根據《獸醫註冊條例》（第529章）成立的香港獸醫管理局（管理局）現時負責獸醫的規管、註冊和紀律監管，確保本港獸醫護理服務維持於高水平。管理局透過規管獸醫而收集的資料，了解獸醫服務的整體情況。自二○一五年起，註冊的獸醫數目持續上升，由二○一五年的823名註冊獸醫增加至今年四月的1 364名註冊獸醫，升幅達65%。註冊獸醫涵蓋眾多專科資格，例如小型動物的內外科、皮膚科、心臟科、腦神經科、獸醫病理學等，因此動物主人應能為其寵物找到合適的獸醫服務。市民亦可按需要購買市面上的寵物保險產品，以應對突發的醫療開支。

除私人獸醫外，香港城市大學和一些動物福利組織（如香港愛護動物協會）亦有提供獸醫服務，故此政府沒有計劃再另外設立公營寵物醫療設施。

（三）為保障公共衞生和預防動物疾病傳播，漁護署按照法例監察和規管動物活動，並評估寵物疫病風險。漁護署根據《公眾衞生（動物及禽鳥）規例》（第139A章）和《狂犬病規例》（第421A章）採用許可證制度規管活生動物進口，以預防動物疾病傳入香港。另外，漁護署透過不同牌照監管本地的動物活動，例如根據《公眾衞生（動物及禽鳥）（售賣及繁育）規例》（第139B章）下的動物售賣商牌照和繁育狗隻牌照規管出售動物及繁育狗隻活動，以及根據《狂犬病規例》要求狗隻畜養人為狗隻接種狂犬病疫苗、植入晶片和申請狗隻牌照，以預防狂犬病。

政府最近一次在二○一八年就全港住戶飼養寵物進行主題性統計調查。漁護署和政府統計處會在今年下旬再次進行統計調查，以收集香港家庭飼養寵物的趨勢和偏好的最新數據。調查結果亦有助業界了解飼養寵物的最新趨勢，讓其按市場需求提供產品和服務。"
LCQ15: Development of pet-related industries,2025-06-11 12:15,2025-06-11 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100333.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Rock Chen and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

It has been reported that the number of households keeping pets has increased in recent years, with pet-related industries developing rapidly. However, there are views pointing out that Hong Kong still has room for improvement in veterinary medical care and pet-friendly public facilities, as well as in data management and policies regarding the pet industry. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is learnt that a number of private shopping centres have introduced pet-inclusive facilities, such as pet accesses and pet rest areas, to attract spending from pet owners and thereby further unleash the potential of the pet economy, whether the Hong Kong Housing Authority will consider drawing on the relevant experience to implement pet-friendly measures in the shopping centres of the public housing estates under its purview; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as it has been reported that public or charity-run veterinary organisations have been established one after another in Taiwan, such as in Taoyuan City and New Taipei City, to provide basic veterinary medical services at transparent charges, which not only enhance pet health protection but also boost the pet economy, whether the HKSAR Government has conducted studies or policy planning regarding the establishment of public or semi-public veterinary medical facilities; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views that maintaining pet-related data can help understand the risks of pet epidemics and diseases, as well as the market structure and potential of the pet industry, whether the Government will establish a territory-wide pet data management platform to systematically collect relevant data, including the number of pets, breed distribution, keeping and vaccination records, and pet disease trends, so as to provide a scientific basis for the formulation of policies on pet-friendliness and developing the pet economy policies; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Having consulted the Housing Bureau, the reply to the question from the Hon Rock Chen is as follows:

(1) As pet keeping has become increasingly common in Hong Kong, there has been more attention in society to bringing animals to enter different premises and use public facilities. In general, the Government needs to take into account different factors when considering whether to further relax existing arrangements, including the nature of individual facilities, whether ancillary facilities are in place and the degree of social acceptance, in order to achieve the policy objective of facilitating people and animals to co-exist harmoniously.

The shopping centres under the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) are mainly ""neighbourhood shopping centres"" located in public housing estates/courts. These shopping centres provide local residents with shopping convenience, with the aim of catering for their basic needs in daily life. All along, guide dogs accompanying the visually impaired have been allowed to enter the HA's shopping centres. The HA has further implemented some pet-friendly policies, such as allowing pets to enter shopping centres if they are placed in pet carrier bags or pet strollers and that no hygiene and environmental nuisance will be caused. The HA will keep in view the development and needs of the community for pet-friendly spaces and facilities, and design ""neighbourhood shopping centres"" that are in line with the actual situation.

On the other hand, the Domain located in Yau Tong is a large-scale regional shopping centre under the HA. Coupled with spacious indoor space, outdoor activity areas, wide passageways and multiple entrances at different locations, it is more equipped with the requisites for development into a pet-friendly mall than typical ""neighbourhood shopping centres"" located in housing estates. The HA will review whether it is appropriate to further provide pet-friendly measures in the Domain, such as installing relevant human-pet friendly facilities to appeal to pet owners for boosting consumption and visitor flow.

(2) The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has been carrying out publicity and public education to remind the public to consider carefully before deciding to keep pets, to assess whether one could fulfil the duties of pet ownership in meeting the pets' basic needs in diet, environment, daily care, healthcare, etc.

On veterinary services, the Veterinary Surgeons Board of Hong Kong (VSB) established under the Veterinary Surgeons Registration Ordinance (Cap. 529), is currently responsible for the regulation, registration and disciplinary control of veterinary surgeons, so as to ensure a high standard of veterinary services in Hong Kong. The VSB learns about the overall veterinary services through data gathered in the regulation of the veterinary profession. The number of registered veterinary surgeons (RVS) has been consistently on the rise since 2015, from 823 in 2015 to 1 364 in April this year, representing an increase of 65 per cent. RVS comprises many specialties, such as small animal internal medicine and surgery, dermatology, cardiology, neurology and veterinary pathology, and therefore animal owners should be able to find appropriate veterinary services for their pets. To meet unexpected medical expenses, members of the public may also purchase pet insurance products available in the market as appropriate.

Apart from private veterinarians, the City University of Hong Kong and some animal welfare organisations (such as the Hong Kong Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) also provide veterinary services and hence the Government currently has no plan to separately establish public medical facilities for pets.

(3) To safeguard public health and prevent the spread of animal diseases, the AFCD monitors and regulates animal activities in accordance with the law, and assesses the risk of pet animal diseases. The AFCD regulates the import of live animals through a permit system under the Public Health (Animals and Birds) Regulations (Cap. 139A) and the Rabies Regulation (Cap. 421A), so as to prevent the introduction of animal diseases into Hong Kong. Furthermore, the AFCD regulates the local animal activities through various licences, for example, regulating the animal trading and dog breeding activities through the Animal Trader Licence and Dog Breeder Licence respectively under the Public Health (Animals and Birds) (Trading and Breeding) Regulations (Cap. 139B), and to require dog keepers to have their dogs vaccinated against rabies, implanted with a microchip, and to apply for a dog licence under the Rabies Regulation, for the prevention of rabies.

The Government last conducted a Thematic Household Survey on pet ownership among households across Hong Kong in 2018. The AFCD and the Census and Statistics Department will conduct another survey later this year to gather the latest data on trends and preferences in pet ownership of Hong Kong families. These findings will assist the trade to learn about the latest trend of pet ownership, for their provision of products and services according to market demand."
LCQ13: Disposal of yard waste,2025-06-11 12:08,2025-06-11 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100322.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Andrew Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) set up Y·PARK, a yard waste recycling centre, in 2021, with the purpose of converting recycled yard waste into useful materials to reduce disposal at landfills and associated carbon emissions. Y·PARK has a target handling capacity of about 11 000 tonnes in the first year, which would gradually increase to an annual average of around 22 000 tonnes. However, information from the Government shows that Y·PARK's throughput last year was 6 876 tonnes. Besides, earlier on some trucks were reportedly driven from Y·PARK carrying yard waste to landfills in the New Territories West for disposal, and the EPD subsequently explained that the yard waste in question was not acceptable as it contained a large amount of impurities. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of Y·PARK's criteria for the recovery of yard waste, whether it has studied the reasons for the gradual decline in the amount of yard waste handled by Y·PARK in recent years, including whether this is affected by Y·PARK's recovery criteria or the fact that yard waste producers recycle their own waste;

(2) as it is learnt that Y·PARK's major sources of yard waste are (i) ‍construction works and (ii) clearance work arising from regular vegetation maintenance, whether there is a statistical breakdown of the amount of yard waste respectively from (i) and (ii) handled by Y·PARK from 2021 to date; of the amount of yard waste that was sent to but not accepted at Y·PARK over the past three years, and whether it has looked into how such yard waste was subsequently disposed of (such as conversion into biochar and being sent to landfills);

(3) given that according to a paper submitted by the Government to the Subcommittee to Study Policy Issues Relating to Municipal Solid Waste Charging, Recovery and Recycling of this Council in January 2023, a pilot biochar plant in EcoPark, which will further convert recyclable products of Y·PARK into biochar, has an estimated capability of converting about 6 000 tonnes of local woody waste into some 1 200 tonnes of biochar annually, of the amounts of waste handled and biochar produced since the plant came into operation, and whether such amounts could meet the targets; if not, when they are expected to meet the targets; and

(4) given that according to the report on Monitoring of Solid Waste in Hong Kong, the amounts of yard waste recovered and disposed in Hong Kong in 2023 were 10 400 tonnes and some 83 000 tonnes respectively, while the amount of yard waste handled by Y·PARK in the same year was 8 609 tonnes, whether it has assessed if there is room for improvement in Y·PARK's handling capacity; whether the Government has further strategies in place to enhance the recovery rate of yard waste?

Reply:

President,

After the onslaught of Super Typhoon Mangkhut, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) set up a temporary yard waste recycling centre, Y·PARK, in 2021 to collect and process yard waste generated from regular vegetation maintenance and public construction works on one hand, and to assist in treating large quantities of yard waste generated after emergency incidents such as super typhoons on the other. The service fees paid by the EPD to the contractor are not based on the amount of yard waste received, but on the quantity of recyclable products produced by the contractor, which reflects Y·PARK's performance more accurately.

The reply to the question raised by the Hon Andrew Lam is as follows:

(1)To ensure the smooth operation of Y·PARK and the quality of the recyclable products, Y·PARK has established appropriate standards for yard waste recycling, including not accepting infected or infested wood, yard waste which is difficult to process such as tree stumps, pure twigs, leaves, grass clippings, or yard waste containing large amount of impurities. If yard waste is mixed with large amount of impurities, the chipping operations may be severely affected. For instance, Y·PARK's wood chipper experienced mechanical failures due to metal rods hidden in the wood. Time and manpower were required to remove the rods, replace parts and repair the equipment. Such incidents could even halt the production line. Meanwhile, the quality of the recyclable products produced may be affected by impurities. For instance, plastics mixed into the recyclable products would limit their use in gardening. In this regard, the contractor of Y·PARK maintains communication with yard waste producers to explain how to properly separate waste at source to reduce instances where Y·PARK has to reject yard waste.

One of the Y·PARK's functions is to assist in handling the large amount of yard waste generated in a short period of time after super typhoons. Therefore, when Y·PARK was set up in 2021, we required the contractor to have sufficient handling capacity as buffer of up to 30 tonnes per day (i.e. about 11 000 tonnes per year) in the first year and to gradually increase to 60 tonnes per day (i.e. about 22 000 tonnes per year) subsequently. Yet the actual amount of yard waste received at Y·PARK is subject to various factors such as the number and intensity of typhoons during the typhoon season each year, the operations and progress of government and private site formation projects, and the quality of the yard waste.

(2) Since its commencement of operation in 2021 up to April this year, Y·PARK has received a total of approximately 31 540 tonnes of yard waste, of which more than 50 per cent from construction works and about 40 per cent from routine vegetation maintenance. The EPD does not have the quantity of rejected yard waste and information on its final disposal means.

(3) The first Pilot Biochar Production Plant (PBPP) in Hong Kong established by the EPD was originally scheduled to commence production in November 2023, with an estimated handling capacity of processing about 6 000 tonnes of local wood materials and producing about 1 200 tonnes of biochar annually. The PBPP commenced its testing in May 2023, during which many technical issues were overcome and various operational conditions (including processing temperatures, duration, and different types of wood-based raw materials) were adjusted and tested, in order to identify the optimal operating conditions and ensure high-quality biochar can be produced with less energy consumption. The PBPP finally commenced production in October 2024. From the start of the PBPP's testing stage to the end of April 2025, the PBPP has processed over 1 200 tonnes of local wood materials from yard waste, converting them into more than 270 tonnes of biochar. The purposes of setting up the PBPP are to explore the technical feasibility of converting local wood materials from yard waste into biochar, as well as to study the quality of the biochar produced and its practical applications in the local market. As such, the actual processing quantity of the PBPP is adjusted based on testing needs and is also affected by the supply of wood materials and local market demand for biochar applications. With the PBPP entering production stage for only about six months, the EPD will consolidate operational experiences with a view to gradually increasing its processing quantity upon establishing technical requirements and market applications.

(4) In order to further enhance the yard waste processing quantity of Y·PARK, the EPD are adopting a multi-pronged approach to increase the yard waste recycling rate. Measures include: (i) the EPD will continue to liaise with relevant government departments and other yard waste producers, encouraging them to adhere to the principles of reduce, reuse, and recycle, and treat and reuse yard waste on-site as far as possible, while yard waste that cannot be treated or reused on-site could be delivered to Y·PARK or other suitable recycling facilities for treatment; (ii) to encourage the Y·PARK contractor to recycle collected yard waste as far as possible to increase its recycling rate. The current contract stipulates that the service fees paid by the EPD to the contractor are based on the quantity of recyclable products produced, providing a financial incentive to the contractor; and (iii) in the long run, the Government reserves land in the New Territories North New Town to establish a larger-scale yard waste recycling facility to enhance yard waste handling capacity."
立法會十三題：園林廢物的處理,2025-06-11 12:08,2025-06-11 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100321.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上林筱魯議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

環境保護署（環保署）於二○二一年設立園林廢物回收中心Y·‍PARK［林·區］，目的是將回收的園林廢物轉化為有用物料，減少堆填區廢棄物及相關碳排放，其首年目標處理量約11 000公噸，隨後會逐步增至平均每年約22 000公噸。然而，政府資料顯示，其去年處理量為6 876公噸。此外，據報早前有貨車從Y·PARK［林·區］駛出，並將車上園林廢物運往新界西堆填區棄置，環保署其後解釋有關園林廢物因混雜大量雜物而未能接收。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）Y·PARK［林·區］回收園林廢物的標準為何；有否研究，近年Y·PARK［林·區］處理園林廢物數量逐步下降的原因為何，包括有否受其回收標準及園林廢物生產者自行回收再造的情況所影響；

（二）鑑於據悉，Y·PARK［林·區］的園林廢物主要來自（i）‍建築工程及（ii）日常植物保養的清理工作，有否統計二○二一年至今Y·PARK［林·區］處理（i）及（ii）的園林廢物數量分別為何；過去三年，曾運往Y·PARK［林·區］而被拒處理的園林廢物的數量為何，以及有否調查該等園林廢物的最後處理方式（例如轉化為生物炭及運往堆填區）；

（三）鑑於根據政府於二○二三年一月提交本會研究與都市固體廢物收費、回收及循環再造相關的政策事宜小組委員會的文件，位於環保園的生物炭試驗設施會將Y·‍PARK［林·區］的再造產品進一步轉化成生物炭，估計每年可處理約6 000公噸的本地木質廢料及生產約1 200公噸生物炭，自該設施運作至今，其廢料處理量及生物炭生產量為何，以及是否達標；如否，預計何時達標；及

（四）鑑於根據《香港固體廢物監察報告》，二○二三年本港園林廢物回收量為10 400公噸，而棄置量為約83 000公噸，而同年Y·PARK［林·區］的園林廢物處理量為8 609公噸，有否評估Y·PARK［林·區］的園林廢物處理量是否有改善空間；政府有否進一步的策略提升園林廢物的回收率？

答覆：

主席：

自超強颱風山竹吹襲香港後，環境保護署（環保署）在二○二一年設立臨時園林廢物回收中心Y·PARK［林‧區］，一方面收集和處理日常植物保養的清理工作和工務工程所產生的園林廢物，另一方面協助處理超強颱風等緊急事故後所產生的大量園林廢物。環保署繳付承辦商的服務費用並非以收集的園林廢物量計算，而是按照承辦商所生產的再生產品量計算，可以更準確反映Y·PARK的工作成效。

就林筱魯議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）為確保Y·PARK運作暢順和再生產品的質素，Y·PARK訂定合適的園林廢物回收標準，包括不接收受感染或被蟲蛀的木頭、難以處理的廢木如樹樁、純嫩枝、樹葉、草屑或混雜大量雜質的園林廢物。若園林廢物混雜大量雜質，有機會嚴重影響碎木的工作，例如Y·PARK的破碎機曾因為木頭內藏有鐵枝而引致機件故障，需耗費時間和人力去除鐵枝、更換零件和維修設備，甚至會導致生產線停止運作。同時，所生產的再生產品質素亦有可能因攙雜雜質而受到影響，例如，若再生產品中混入了塑膠便會限制其在園藝種植的應用。為此，Y·PARK承辦商與園林廢物產生者保持溝通，講解如何從源頭做好分類工作，以減少Y·PARK需拒收園林廢物的情況。

Y·PARK其中一個功能是協助處理超強颱風後短時間內所產生的大量園林廢物，因此在Y·PARK於二○二一年成立之初，我們要求承辦商具備足夠緩衝處理能力，首年須具備最高每日30公噸的處理量（即每年約為11 000公噸），而隨後逐步增加至每日60公噸（即每年約為22 000公噸）。然而，Y·PARK的實際園林廢物收集量受多項因素所影響，例如每年風季的颱風數目和強度、政府和私人地盤平整工程的運作和進度，以及園林廢物的質量。

（二）由二○二一年開始運作以來，截至今年四月，Y·PARK共接收約31 540公噸園林廢物，當中超過五成來自建築工程和約四成來自日常植物保養工作。環保署並未有備存被拒收的園林廢物數量記錄以及其最後處理方式的資料。

（三）環保署設立的本港首座生物炭生產試驗設施（試驗設施）原定計劃是二○二三年十一月正式投產，每年處理約6 000公噸的本地木質廢料及生產約1 200公噸生物炭為試驗設施的預計處理能力。試驗設施由二○二三年五月開始進行測試運作，期間克服了不少技術問題，以及就不同運作條件（包括處理溫度、停留時間和不同的木質原材料）進行調試，以找出最佳的運作條件，確保能以較低的能源消耗量製造出高品質的生物碳，試驗設施最終於二○二四年十月正式投產。試驗設施自進行測試運作至二○二五年四月底，已處理超過1 200公噸的本地木質廢料，轉化成超過270公噸的生物炭。試驗設施的設立是為了測試使用本地木質廢料轉化成生物炭的技術可行性，以及研究提升生物炭的質量和在本地市場的應用成效。因此，試驗設施的實際處理量會隨着測試需要而調節，亦會受到的木質廢料的供應及本地市場對生物碳的應用需求等影響。試驗設施投產只有約半年時間，環保署會總結運作經驗，以確立技術要求和市場應用後，逐步提升設施的處理量。

（四）為進一步改善Y·PARK的園林廢物處理量，環保署會多管齊下以提升園林廢物的回收率，包括：（一）環保署會持續與相關政府部門及其他園林廢物生產者保持溝通，鼓勵他們根據減少、重用和循環再造的原則，盡量把園林廢物在原地處理和循環再用，而未能原地處理或循環再用的園林廢物，可送往Y·PARK或其他合適的回收設施處理；（二）為鼓勵Y·PARK承辦商盡量將收集到的園林廢物循環再造以提升其回收率，現時合約訂明環保署繳付承辦商的服務費用是按其所生產的再生產品量計算，確保承辦商有經濟誘因；及（三）長遠而言，政府會於新界北新市鎮預留土地發展更具規模的園林廢物回收設施，以提升園林廢物處理能力。"
LCQ8: Public bicycle parking spaces,2025-06-11 11:45,2025-06-11 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100290.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Stanley Li and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

Some members of the public are of the view that the Government should take measures to ensure that public bicycle parking spaces in the New Territories are put to good use. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the total number of public bicycle parking spaces provided by the Government in the New Territories South East (broken down by Legislative Council election geographical constituency) as at the end of last year, as well as the government departments responsible for the management of such parking spaces and the total area occupied by such parking spaces;

(2) as it is stipulated in the existing legislation that no bicycle shall be parked in a parking place for a continuous period of more than 24 ‍hours, of the follow-up mechanism adopted by government departments against bicycles parked overtime at public bicycle parking spaces (including the frequency of follow-up actions and the ways to handle such bicycles); whether the Government has reviewed the existing arrangements for the management of public bicycle parking spaces; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) of the specific procedures of the inter-departmental joint operations taken by the Government against bicycles which have been parked for a long period of time, or which are unclaimed or abandoned at public bicycle parking spaces (including the government departments involved and the frequency of such operations); the number of such joint operations, the number of bicycles handled and the expenditure incurred for such operations in the past three years; whether it had assessed the effectiveness of such operations, and of the relevant assessment standards;

(4) of the number of complaints received by the Government in the past three years about public bicycle parking spaces in the New Territories South East being occupied for a long period of time or being used for stacking non-cycling articles, as well as the details of the measures taken by the Government in respect of such cases, including the specific division of work and collaborative mechanism among the law enforcement departments involved, and whether it has kept follow-up records in respect of the cityscape and hygiene problems arising from such cases; and

(5) whether the Government has considered using the New Territories South East as a pilot district to provide covered ""smart bicycle parking spaces"" (e.g. those equipped with anti-theft devices, surveillance devices, electronic locks and sensors, etc) on a monthly or hourly basis under the user pays mode, and making reference to the experience of other regions in the management of smart parking spaces to explore suitable options to enhance the management of public bicycle parking spaces in Hong Kong; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

It is the Government's policy to foster a ""bicycle-friendly"" environment where road safety considerations and circumstances permit by adding cycling tracks and related facilities in new development areas and new towns as well as improving existing facilities (including bicycle parking facilities), with a view to facilitating the public use of bicycles for recreational or short-distance commuting purposes, thereby reducing the use of mechanised transport. In response to the question raised by the Hon Stanley Li, our reply in consultation with the related departments is provided as follows:

(1) As of the end of 2024, the Government is managing and providing about 10 000 public bicycle parking spaces, with a total area of about 11 000 square meters in the Legislative Council New Territories South East geographical constituency. The aforementioned parking spaces are generally managed by the Transport Department (TD), the Housing Department, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department.

(2) and (3) According to the Road Traffic (Parking) Regulations (Cap. 374C), on public roads with street lighting, bicycles can only be parked at a designated bicycle parking place. Any person who parks a bicycle in a bicycle parking place for a continuous period of more than 24 hours commits an offence and is liable to a fine at level 1 (currently $2,000).

At present, related departments (including the District Offices under the Home Affairs Department, the District Lands Offices, the TD, the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the FEHD) conduct joint operations as necessary based on actual circumstances and needs to remove illegally parked or abandoned bicycles. In the past three years (from 2022 to 2024), a total of 331 joint operations were conducted by the related departments, with over 20 000 illegally parked bicycles from public bicycle parking spaces being removed. The increase in the number of joint operations year by year and the slight decrease in the average number of bicycles cleared per operation have reflected the improved enforcement strength and the deterrent effect. The relevant breakdown is as follows:




Year
Number of joint operations
Number of bicycles cleared
Average number of bicycles cleared per operation


2022
89
5 969
67


2023
111
7 278
66


2024
131
7 646
58


Total
331
20 893




The joint operations and enforcement actions are conducted by relevant departments in accordance with established procedures and empowered by relevant legislations. More specifically, the TD and the HKPF will issue and post notices respectively regarding the temporary suspension of the relevant bicycle parking spaces at least 14 days prior to the joint operation. Since such areas are no longer designated public bicycle parking space during the suspension period, any bicycle parked there may be regarded as unauthorised occupation of government land. On the effective day of suspension (generally two days before the joint operation), the HKPF will cover the bicycle parking signage and close off the area. The relevant District Lands Office will post statutory notice on each bicycle still present within the operation area under the Land (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 28) and post notices at appropriate places, requiring the persons concerned to remove the bicycles by a specific date (i.e. the day of operation); otherwise the bicycles will be removed. On the day of joint operation, the FEHD will assist in removing the remaining bicycles parked in the area with notices posted, and hand them over to the local District Lands Office for taking over and disposal; the persons concerned cannot get back the bicycles. The bicycle parking spaces will be re-opened for public use after the operation.

The expenditures of joint operations are absorbed by the overall resources of the respective departments, and have not been separately identified.

(4) In the past three years, in respect of bicycle parking spaces in the New Territories South East, the Lands Department has received a total of 292 and 1 572 complaints about illegal bicycle parking in Sai Kung District and Sha Tin District respectively; and the FEHD has not received any complaint regarding the public bicycle parking spaces under FEHD's management being locked or with non-bicycle items piling up. As aforementioned, the Government conducted over 300 joint operations in the past three years; and if the FEHD detects accumulation of refuse in public bicycle parking spaces, immediate cleaning by contractors will be arranged.

(5) The Government has been committed to promoting the development of a smart city and has introduced intelligent technologies in various aspects to enhance service quality and public convenience. With the promotion and co-ordination of the Government, some private development projects have introduced ""smart bicycle parking systems"", while some have improved management quality by offering indoor bicycle parking spaces. The Government is studying to include bicycle parking spaces as ancillary facilities within land uses, requiring new development projects to provide sufficient bicycle parking spaces according to their land use and scale. These facilities, like other ancillary facilities, will be managed and maintained by the land developer or the responsible party to improve the facilities' overall quality and further foster a ""bicycle-friendly"" environment. Regarding public bicycle parking spaces, given the relatively high construction and maintenance costs of ""smart bicycle parking systems"", the Government will utilise facilities that are designed to be more effective and user-friendly, such as double-deck parking racks, and will give priority to allocating resources for more pressing transport infrastructure projects for now. Meanwhile, we will continue to keep in view the technological development of ""smart bicycle parking systems"", and assess their applicability in Hong Kong's public bicycle parking spaces in a timely manner."
LCQ7: Draining pipe testing with dye powder,2025-06-11 11:45,2025-06-11 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100313.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Steven Ho and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

It has been reported that on February 15 this year, the water of Tuen Mun River turned red extensively, causing panic among members of the public. The Government's initial investigation revealed that there was draining pipe testing with red dye powder. Upon arrival of the Government's investigating officers at the scene, they found that the river water had resumed normal and no fish deaths were found. They collected water samples on the same day for testing and found that the water quality indicators remained normal as well. However, it is learnt that similar incidents also occurred on Lam Tsuen River in Tai Po and Shing Mun River in Tai Wai in August 2023 and November 2022 respectively, which have aroused widespread concern in the community. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of the aforesaid similar incidents in the past five years, as well as the government department(s) involved in the investigation of each incident, the average manpower involved, the time taken for the investigations and the public expenditure involved;

(2) as there are views that although the test results have indicated that the aforesaid incident has not caused impact on the environment, water quality and fish for the time being, the incident has still caused panic among members of the public, whether the Government will take further actions to follow up the incident, so as to enhance protection for the public; and

(3) whether the Government has formulated detailed guidelines on draining pipe testing with dye powder at present; if so, of the details, including whether non-compliance with the relevant guidelines will constitute any offence or attract penalty; if not, whether it will consider formulating the guidelines and enhancing the relevant notification mechanism, so as to avoid causing misunderstanding or panic among members of the public in the event of an incident?

Reply:

President,

The reply to the question raised by the Hon Steven Ho is as follows:

(1) and (2) In the past five years, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) received a total of 21 cases of inquiries related to dye test. Upon receiving relevant complaints, the EPD will promptly dispatch personnel to conduct investigation on site, including measuring the dissolved oxygen content and pH level in the water, as well as collecting water samples for further testing to determine the cause of water coloration and whether pollution has occurred. The EPD will also check in the vicinity of the site concerned for any fish deaths or other unusual circumstances, and trace the source of pollution along the stormwater drains. Depending on individual circumstances, the Drainage Services Department (DSD) may also assist in the tracing investigation. If illegal discharges of wastewater are found, the EPD will take appropriate enforcement actions in accordance with the law. The investigation of water coloration incidents is part of the EPD's integrated enforcement efforts and the duration of investigation may also vary depending on the location and scope of individual case. Therefore, there is no breakdown of the expenditure involved.

To foster protection to the general public, the EPD will respond to inquiries from complainants and the media as soon as there are preliminary results of the investigation, in order to enhance information transparency and alleviate public concerns. Depending on individual circumstances, the EPD may also return to the site the day after collecting water samples to inspect whether there have been any changes and to further follow-up as required.

(3) Conducting dye tests is an effective method to check the sewer systems for misconnections to stormwater drains or leakage. When the EPD personnel conduct tests to examine sewer misconnection issues, they will use the minimum amount of dye possible to reduce the impact on nearby rivers and bays.

For the trades and private buildings, as well as housing estates, the EPD, the Buildings Department (BD), and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) have developed relevant guidelines for dye tests for pipe testing respectively (which can be downloaded from the websites of the EPD, the BD and the FEHD). Through promotion and education, we also remind the trades, including property management companies and building contractors, about the precautions and pollution prevention measures associated with dye tests. These include strictly adhering to the recommendations of the dye manufacturers during testing, arranging for personnel supervision, and notifying the property management company of the testing site and nearby residents in advance to avoid giving rise to public concerns. The above guidelines are administrative measures. However, we must emphasise that the dye used is a biodegradable and non-toxic substance, and does not affect water quality. In this regard, conducting dye test does not violate the Water Pollution Control Ordinance (Cap. 358).

Regarding the notification mechanism, we understand that dye test may lead to public misunderstanding. Therefore, the DSD will issue notifications on its website before conducting regular dye tests to inform the public about the arrangements for these dye tests. The purpose of these regular tests is to ensure the integrity of the submarine outfalls of sewage treatment plants. Since conducting dye tests on submarine outfalls requires a larger amount of dye and involves a wider area, it is more likely to attract public attention.

Based on the complaint and specific circumstances of the case, the EPD occasionally needs to use dye tests to check on sewage misconnection issues or carry out enforcement actions. Yet these circumstances would involve a smaller amount of dye used and a smaller impact area which in general would not cause any impact."
立法會八題：公共單車泊位,2025-06-11 11:45,2025-06-11 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100275.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上李世榮議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

有市民認為，政府應採取措施以確保新界區的公共單車泊位獲善用。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）截至去年底，政府於新界東南區（按立法會選舉地方選區劃分）一共提供了多少個公眾單車泊位，以及負責管理該等泊位的政府部門及泊位所佔的總面積為為何；

（二）鑑於現時法例規定單車不得在泊車處連續停泊超過24小時，政府部門針對公共單車泊位的超時停泊單車的跟進機制（包括跟進行動的頻率及處理方法）為何；政府有否檢討現行公共單車泊位的管理安排；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）針對長期停泊、無人認領或被遺棄於公共單車泊位的單車，政府所採取的跨部門聯合行動的具體程序（包括涉及的政府部門及行動頻率）為何；過去三年，該等聯合行動的次數、所處理的單車數目及行動支出為何；有否評估該等行動的成效，以及有關的評估標準為何；

（四）過去三年，政府收到多少宗關於新界東南區公共單車泊位被長期佔用或用以堆放非單車物品的投訴，以及政府就該等個案所採取措施的詳情為何，包括涉及執法部門的具體分工及協作機制，以及有否備存就該等個案所引致的市容及衞生問題的跟進紀錄；及

（五）政府有否考慮以新界東南區作試點，以用者自付模式提供月租或時租的有蓋「智能單車泊位」（例如設有防盜、監控、電子鎖和感應器等裝置），並參考其他地區的智能泊位管理經驗，研究適合方案以優化本港的公共單車泊位管理；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府的政策是在道路安全及環境許可的前提下推動「單車友善」環境，在新發展區及新市鎮加設單車徑及相關設施，並改善現有設施（包括單車停泊設施），以方便市民騎單車作為康樂或短途代步用途，減少使用機動交通工具。就李世榮議員的提問，經諮詢各相關部門，現回覆如下：

（一）截至二○二四年底，政府在新界東南立法會選區內，管理及提供約10 000個公眾單車泊位，佔地總面積約為11 000平方米。上述泊位一般由運輸署、房屋署、食物環境衞生署（食環署）和康樂及文化事務署管理。

（二）及（三）根據《道路交通（泊車）規例》（第374C章），在設有街燈的公共道路上，只可在指定單車泊車處停泊單車。任何人在單車泊車處連續停泊單車超過24小時，即屬犯罪，可處第1級罰款（現時為2,000元）。

現時各相關部門包括分區民政事務處、分區地政處、運輸署、警務處和食環署等，會按實際情況和需要適時採取聯合行動，清理違例停泊或棄置的單車。過去三年（即由二○二二年至二○二四年），相關部門共採取331次聯合行動，移除超過20 000輛違例停泊在公共單車泊位的單車。聯合行動次數逐年增長，而每次行動中平均清理的單車數目稍為下降，反映執法力度和阻嚇性均有提升。有關分項數字如下：




年份
聯合行動次數
清理的單車數量
每次行動平均清理的單車數量


2022
89
5 969
67


2023
111
7 278
66


2024
131
7 646
58


總數
331
20 893




相關部門根據既定程序和法例賦予的權力進行聯合行動和執管工作。具體而言，運輸署及警務處會於聯合行動前最少14日，分別發出及張貼有關單車停泊處暫停使用的通告。由於有關地點於暫停使用期間不再屬於公眾單車泊位，在該處停泊單車可被視作非法佔用政府土地。在單車停泊處開始暫停使用當日（一般為聯合行動前兩日），警務處會遮蔽單車停泊處標誌並封閉該處。當區地政處會按照《土地（雜項條文）條例》（第28章）於行動範圍內每一輛當時仍停泊於該處的單車上張貼通知，並於適當地方張貼通告，勒令有關人士須於指定日期（即清理行動當日）前移走單車，否則相關單車會被移除。聯合行動當日，食環署會協助移除已予張貼通知但仍停放於該處的單車，並交由當區地政處接管及處置，相關人士不能贖回。有關單車停泊處會於行動後重新開放予公眾使用。
​
聯合行動的開支由各部門的整體資源承擔，未有分開計算。

（四）過去三年，就新界東南區內單車泊位，地政總署接獲於西貢區和沙田區違泊單車的投訴個案數目分別為292宗和1 572宗；而食環署並沒有接獲轄下管理範圍內的公眾單車泊位被鎖上或堆放非單車物品的投訴個案。如上文所述，政府已於過去三年進行超過300次聯合行動；另外，食環署若發現在公眾單車泊位有垃圾堆積，會即時安排承辦商清掃。

（五）政府一直致力推動智慧城市的發展，並已在多個領域引入智能技術以提升服務質素和市民生活便利性。經過政府的推動和配合，近年開始有私人發展項目引入了「智能單車泊位」系統，亦有一些私人發展項目透過在室內提供單車泊位提升管理質素。政府目前正研究將單車泊位納入為土地用途的附屬設施，要求新發展項目按其土地用途及規模，配備足夠單車泊位，相關設施會與其他用地附屬設施一樣，由該用地發展商或負責人管理和維護，以提升設施質量，進一步推動「單車友善」環境。就公眾單車停泊處方面，考慮到「智能單車泊位」涉及較高建設及維護成本，政府現階段會使用設計更為有效和易用的設施，例如雙層單車泊架，並優先投放更多資源於更迫切的交通基建項目。與此同時，我們會繼續留意「智能單車泊位」技術的發展，適時評估其在本港公共單車停泊處的適用性。"
立法會七題：使用色粉作渠管檢測,2025-06-11 11:45,2025-06-11 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100307.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上何俊賢議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

據報，本年二月十五日，屯門河水呈現大面積紅色，引起市民恐慌。經政府初步調查，懷疑有人使用紅色色粉作渠管檢測。雖然政府調查人員到場時河水已回復正常及沒有發現魚類死亡，而當日抽取的水樣本也顯示水質指數正常，但據悉類似事件也曾於二○二三年八月及二○二二年十一月分別在大埔林村河和大圍城門河發生，引起社會廣泛關注。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，上述類似事件的宗數為何，以及每宗事件的調查工作所涉及的政府部門、平均所涉人手、調查時間及涉及的公帑開支為何；

（二）鑑於有意見認為，雖然化驗結果顯示上述事件暫未對環境、水質及魚類造成影響，但事件仍對公眾造成恐慌，政府會否採取進一步行動跟進事件，以加強對公眾的保障；及

（三）現時政府有否就使用色粉作渠管檢測制訂詳細指引；如有，詳情為何，包括不遵從相關指引會否構成任何罪行或罰則；如否，會否考慮制訂指引，並完善相關通報機制，以免發生事故時引起公眾誤會或恐慌？

答覆：

主席：

就何俊賢議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）過去五年，環境保護署（環保署）共接獲21宗涉及色粉測試的查詢個案。在收到相關投訴後，環保署會盡快派員到現場進行調查，包括量度水中的溶解氧含量和酸鹼值，以及抽取水樣本作進一步化驗，以確定水體變色原因和是否受到污染。環保署亦會檢視附近有否魚類死亡或其他不尋常的情況，沿雨水渠追蹤污染源頭。視乎個別情況，渠務署也會協助追蹤調查，若發現有非法排放污水的情況，環保署會依法採取相應執法行動。有關調查水體變色是環保署綜合執法工作的一部分，調查的時間亦因應個別個案的位置和範圍而有所不同，因此並沒有相關公帑開支的分項數據。

為加強對公眾的保障，環保署會在調查有初步結果時盡快回覆投訴人和傳媒的查詢，以提高資訊透明度和釋除公眾疑慮。視乎個別情況，環保署更會在抽取水樣本翌日，再次到達現場視察情況有否發生變化，而需要作進一步的跟進。

（三）使用色粉測試是檢查污水渠有否錯誤接駁至雨水渠或滲漏的有效辦法。環保署人員進行測試檢查污水渠錯駁問題時，會盡量使用最少的染色劑量，以減低對附近河流及海灣的影響。

在業界和私人樓宇及屋苑方面，環保署、屋宇署和食物環境衞生署（食環署）已分別就使用色粉作渠管檢測制定了相關指引（可在環保署、屋宇署和食環署的網站下載），亦會透過宣傳及教育，提醒業界如物業管理公司、建築商等，使用色粉測試劑所須注意的事項和防污措施，例如檢測時須嚴格遵守色粉測試劑生產商的建議、安排人員監督、盡早通知檢測地點的物業管理公司及附近一帶的居民，以免引起公眾疑慮。上述指引屬於行政措施，但我們必須強調，色粉為可分解物質及沒有毒性，並且沒有影響水質，因此進行色粉測試沒有違反《水污染管制條例》（第358章）。

通報機制方面，我們理解色粉測試或會引起公眾誤會，所以渠務署會在進行定期色粉檢測前，在其網頁發放通知，讓市民知悉有關色粉測試的安排。這些定期測試目的是確保污水處理廠的海底排放管無損，而由於為海底排放管進行色粉測試需要用的染色劑量較多而且範圍較大，較易引起市民關注。

環保署則因應投訴和個案的特別情況，需要不時使用色粉測試以檢查污水渠錯駁問題或進行執法，但這些情況使用的染色劑量及影響範圍較少，一般都不會造成影響。"
立法會十題：跨境貨車的便利措施,2025-06-11 11:43,2025-06-11 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100226.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上嚴剛議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

據報，政府將於本年內公布「粵車南下」的細節，首階段僅允許非營運小型載客汽車申請。有物流運輸業界人士期望政府善用港珠澳大橋，藉「粵車南下」實施的契機，優化粵港跨境內地貨車的相關政策，以進一步鞏固香港作為粵港澳大灣區核心樞紐的角色，並帶動香港國際機場（機場）、貨櫃碼頭和整體物流業的發展。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）政府會否在擬定「粵車南下」政策的同時，與內地部門商討優化跨境內地貨車的相關政策（包括粵港兩地政府協調的配額制度），以便利跨境貨車往來內地與香港；若會，詳情為何，包括預計時會公布相關政策；

（二）政府會否優化南下跨境內地貨車的申請流程或推出新措施，例如參考現時「封閉道路通行許可證」制度，但簡化當中的申請流程，讓一定數目的內地貨車經指定路線直達香港指定的主要貨運樞紐（包括機場貨運站和貨櫃碼頭）；及

（三）政府會否參考其他地區的經驗（例如歐洲的「綠卡制度」（一種跨國車用保險卡制度）），推動粵港澳三地汽車保險互認機制，以實現「一險通行」？

答覆：

主席：

運輸及物流局高度重視現代物流發展，並銳意將香港打造為國際智慧物流樞紐。為此，政府於二○二三年公布《現代物流發展行動綱領》，並提出透過完善多式聯運以增強香港作為貨物來往大灣區門戶和關鍵轉運樞紐的角色。其中，陸路跨境貨運是大灣區內地城市與香港之間的主要貨運模式，亦是香港與內地的「鐵海陸江」立體聯運體系的重要組成部分。另一方面，跨境貨車亦是運載民生物資的主要渠道，對於香港民生物資供應至關重要。因此，運輸及物流局一向重視改善陸路跨境貨運安排，並在處理與跨境貨車有關的事宜時，緊守「保運力、保穩定」的政策原則，以及考慮不同持分者的意見，以確保陸路跨境貨運暢通和運力充足，從而為鞏固及提升香港國際航運中心、國際航空樞紐和國際物流樞紐地位作有力支撐。

經諮詢財經事務及庫務局和運輸署，就嚴議員提問的各部分現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）來往內地與香港的跨境貨車受粵港兩地政府同意並共同管理的配額制度所規管。來自內地的貨車如需申辦香港牌證，取得內地跨境貨車配額的持有人須先向內地相關部門為其貨車申請《粵港澳機動車輛往來及駕駛人駕車批准通知書》（俗稱批文卡）；配額持有人亦須為其貨車向運輸署申請車輛評定及進行車輛檢驗，在檢驗合格後可辦理車輛登記及領牌，和申領「封閉道路通行許可證」（許可證）。運輸署會根據批文卡上通行口岸的批註，簽發許可證以讓有關跨境貨車經指定口岸往來粵港兩地。此外，駕駛有關貨車來自內地的司機亦須持有該車輛類別（例如輕型、中型或重型貨車）的香港正式駕駛執照。由二○二二年至二○二五年四月，持有有效許可證的跨境貨車數目保持約有一萬輛，當中來自內地的貨車數目有增長。

粵港雙方一直保持緊密聯繫，視乎兩地貨運物流的發展情況、本地交通承載力和業界的反應，適時檢視和優化有關跨境貨車的便利措施，並不時檢視跨境貨車的配額數目。如內地有關單位提出增加配額，港方會提效加快批核。另外，運輸署亦已優化跨境貨車的車輛評定安排，以提速完成程序。一般而言，若所有申請文件齊備及準確，由車輛評定、檢驗、登記領牌、以及申請許可證，所需時間已大幅縮短至最快三至四星期內完成。

（三）保險方面，保險業監管局一直有就跨境車輛的保險安排與有關當局及保險業界商討，致力提供便利和適切保險產品。例如就「港車北上」，政府已同步推出跨境汽車保險「等效先認」安排，讓經港珠澳大橋進入廣東省行駛的香港私家車向香港保險公司投保的責任範圍可擴大到內地的第三者責任保險，而無須分別購買兩地保單，進一步便利往返粵港兩地。政府會繼續留意跨境貨運物流業的發展，適時檢視有關措施。"
LCQ10: Facilitation measures for cross-boundary goods vehicles,2025-06-11 11:43,2025-06-11 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100227.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Yim Kong and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

It has been reported that the Government will announce the details of Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles within this year, and only non-commercial small passenger vehicles will be allowed to apply under the first phase of implementation. Some members of the logistics and transport industries expect the Government to make good use of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and take the opportunity of implementing Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles to enhance the relevant policy on Guangdong/Hong Kong cross-boundary Mainland goods vehicles, so as to further consolidate Hong Kong's role as the prominent hub for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and to drive the development of the Hong Kong International Airport (the airport), container terminals, and the entire logistics industry. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the Government will, in the course of formulating the policy on Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles, discuss with the Mainland authorities the enhancement of the relevant policy on cross-boundary Mainland goods vehicles (including the quota system coordinated by the governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong), so as to facilitate cross-boundary goods vehicles in travelling between the Mainland and Hong Kong; if so, of the details, including the expected time of announcing the relevant policy;

(2) whether the Government will enhance the application process for southbound cross-boundary Mainland goods vehicles or introduce new measures, e.g. making reference to the existing system of ""closed road permits"" while streamlining the application process therein, such that a certain number of Mainland goods vehicles will be allowed to reach designated major cargo hubs in Hong Kong (including the cargo terminals of the airport and container terminals) directly via designated routes; and

(3) whether the Government will make reference to the experience of other places (e.g. the ""Green Card system"" (a kind of cross-border motor insurance card system) in Europe) and promote a mutual recognition mechanism for motor insurance among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, so as to achieve ""one insurance policy for all""?

Reply:

President,

The Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB) attaches great importance to the development of modern logistics, and is committed to developing Hong Kong into an international smart logistics hub. To this end, the Government promulgated the Action Plan on Modern Logistics Development in 2023, which proposed to enhance Hong Kong's role as the gateway and key transshipment hub for cargoes to and from the Greater Bay Area (GBA) by improving multimodal transport. In particular, cross-boundary land freight transport is a major mode of freight transport between Hong Kong and other cities in the GBA, as well as an important component of the ""rail-sea-land-river"" intermodal transport system between Hong Kong and the Mainland. On the other hand, cross-boundary goods vehicles are also a major means for transporting daily supplies and are of crucial importance to the livelihood of Hong Kong people. Hence, the TLB has always placed strong emphasis on improving cross-boundary land freight transport arrangements. In handling matters related to cross-boundary goods vehicles, the TLB always adheres to the policy principle of ""maintaining capacity and stability"" and takes into account the views of different stakeholders, so as to ensure smooth operation and adequate capacity of cross-boundary land freight transport, thereby providing staunch support for strengthening and enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international maritime centre, international aviation hub and international logistics hub.

Having consulted the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, and the Transport Department (TD), our reply to various parts of the Hon Yim's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) Cross-boundary goods vehicles are subject to the regulation of the quota system which is agreed and jointly administered by the governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong. If the Mainland goods vehicles need to apply for Hong Kong permit/licence, holders of the Mainland goods vehicle quotas must first apply to the relevant Mainland authority for the Mainland Approval Notice (commonly known as MAN) for their goods vehicles. The quota holders should also apply to the TD for vehicle approval and vehicle examination for their goods vehicles; upon passing the vehicle examination, they could proceed with vehicle registration and licensing as well as apply for Closed Road Permit (CRP). The TD would issue CRPs according to the approved boundary crossing(s) recorded on the MAN so that cross-boundary goods vehicles concerned could ply between Guangdong and Hong Kong via the designated boundary crossing(s). Besides, drivers from the Mainland driving the goods vehicles concerned should hold a full Hong Kong driving licence for the corresponding vehicle class(es) (such as light, medium or heavy goods vehicles). From 2022 to April 2025, the number of cross-boundary goods vehicles with valid CRPs maintained at about 10 000, among which goods vehicles from the Mainland have increased.

Guangdong and Hong Kong have been maintaining close liaison, and will review and enhance relevant facilitation measures for cross-boundary goods vehicles as appropriate subject to the development of freight logistics, local traffic capacity and trade's responses in both places. Guangdong and Hong Kong also keep reviewing the number of quotas for cross-boundary goods vehicles from time to time. If the Mainland authorities seek to increase the quotas, Hong Kong will expedite the vetting with enhanced efficiency. Besides, the TD has enhanced the arrangement of vehicle approval for cross-boundary goods vehicles with a view to completing the relevant process with enhanced speed. In general, if all the documents required are in order and accurate, the time needed for completion of vehicle approval, examination, registration and licensing, as well as CRP application has been greatly shortened to as fast as three to four weeks.

(3) The Insurance Authority has been in discussion with relevant authorities and the insurance industry on the insurance arrangement for cross-boundary vehicles, with a view to providing facilitation and appropriate insurance products. Take Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles as an example, the Government has at the same time implemented the ""unilateral recognition"" arrangement for cross-boundary motor insurance, which allows Hong Kong private cars driving into Guangdong via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge to extend the coverage of their third-party liability insurance purchased from Hong Kong insurers to the Mainland, thereby eliminating the need for separate policies in both places and facilitating travel between Guangdong and Hong Kong. The Government will continue to monitor the development of the cross-boundary freight and logistics industry, and review the relevant measures in a timely manner."

立法會十六題：香港認可經濟營運商計劃,2025-06-11 11:05,2025-06-11 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100312.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上易志明議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的書面答覆：

問題：

根據香港海關資料，自推出香港認可經濟營運商計劃至今，有約90家企業成為認可經濟營運商（AEO），其貨物運往與香港達成AEO互認安排的16個經濟體可享有便利通關安排，有助促進貨物無縫跨境流動。然而，有意見認為，現時企業參與該計劃的比率和該計劃的覆蓋範圍未夠廣泛。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，涉及香港AEO的進出口貨量及貨值，以及其佔總貨量及貨值的百分比分別為何；

（二）鑑於有意見認為，為提升本地及內地貨物進出口的效率，香港必須進一步擴大互認安排的覆蓋網絡，當局與更多經濟體簽署互認安排協議的進展為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見指出，企業獲認證成為AEO除可令其享有快速的通關安排外，還有助提升企業的管理水平，而內地甚至設立培訓基地以鼓勵更多企業成為AEO，政府有何措施推動更多本地企業成為AEO？

答覆：

主席︰

就易志明議員的提問，經諮詢香港海關後，現回覆如下：

過去三年，涉及香港認可經濟營運商（AEO）的進出口貨量及貨值，以及其佔總貨量及貨值的百分比如下：

目前香港已和16個經濟體簽訂AEO互認安排，按數目計全球排名第四，僅次於中國內地、韓國及美國。香港海關一直積極拓展AEO互認安排的全球網絡，近年亦取得良好進展，先後與包括土耳其、沙特阿拉伯、柬埔寨、菲律賓、阿拉伯聯合酋長國、老撾、秘魯及智利在內的八個經濟體簽訂了互認安排的行動計劃，這標誌着雙方落實發展互認安排的重要第一步。香港海關正積極與這些經濟體的海關組織就簽訂互認安排進行商討和跟進工作。

展望將來，香港海關會持續擴展互認安排網絡，主動聯繫香港主要貿易夥伴及配合國家「一帶一路」發展策略，優先與「一帶一路」經濟體，包括東南亞國家聯盟、海灣阿拉伯國家合作委員會成員國、南美及非洲地區等商討發展互認安排，務求讓更多企業受惠。

為推動本地企業成為香港AEO，香港海關持續透過與業界、各大商會和相關合作夥伴的合作，舉辦各類型的宣傳及推廣活動，包括簡介會及展覽攤位，以提升企業對香港AEO計劃的認識。去年，香港海關於不同的大型活動期間，例如由「一帶一路」辦公室及香港貿易發展局（貿發局）合辦的「一帶一路高峰論壇」，以及由香港特別行政區政府及貿發局主辦的亞洲物流航運及空運會議，設置展覽攤位及舉行專題研討會，促進與不同領域及業界的交流。同時，香港海關亦透過網頁及社交媒體發布有關本地與全球AEO計劃發展的最新消息，擴大推廣及宣傳工作的接觸面，並加強與持份者的溝通和連繫。

為進一步提升香港AEO計劃的吸引力，香港海關積極爭取與不同的機構組織合作，為AEO提供更多優惠。其中包括與香港出口信用保險局合作，為香港AEO提供免費買家信用評估服務，協助AEO應對市場風險。此外，香港海關於二○二三年與國家海關總署和澳門海關簽訂內地、香港及澳門海關AEO互認安排下關於《深化粵港澳大灣區AEO合作的備忘錄》，透過互相推薦AEO申請、加強聯合宣傳和人員培訓等措施，深化三方海關的合作，並有助三地企業把握粵港澳大灣區的發展機遇。"

Question:

  According to the information of the Customs and Excise Department, since the launch of the Hong Kong Authorized Economic Operator Programme, about 90 enterprises have become Authorized Economic Operators (AEOs), and their goods transported to the 16 economies with which Hong Kong has entered into AEO mutual recognition arrangements (MRAs) can enjoy customs facilitation arrangements, which is instrumental in facilitating seamless cross-boundary movement of goods. However, there are views that the current rate of enterprise participation in the Programme and the coverage of the Programme are not extensive enough. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the volume and value of imported and exported goods involving Hong Kong AEOs in the past three years, as well as their respective percentages in the total volume and value of such goods;

(2) as there are views that in order to enhance the efficiency of the import and export of local and Mainland goods, Hong Kong must further extend the coverage of the MRA network, of the progress of the authorities' entering into MRA agreements with more economies; and

(3) as there are views that apart from enabling enterprises to enjoy speedy customs arrangements, being accredited as the AEOs also helps enhance the management standards of enterprises, and the Mainland has even set up training bases to encourage more enterprises to become the AEOs, of the measures put in place by the Government to encourage more local enterprises to become the AEOs?

Reply:

President,

  Having consulted the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED), the reply to the question raised by the Hon Frankie Yick is as follows:

  The volume and value of imported and exported goods involving Hong Kong Authorized Economic Operators (AEOs) in the past three years, along with their respective percentages in the total volume and value of imported and exported goods, are shown below:




Year
Volume of imported and exported goods involving Hong Kong AEOs (consignment)
Percentage in Hong Kong's total volume of imported and exported goods


2022
1.78 million

12.15%


2024
1,318 billion
13.90%




  At present, Hong Kong has ratified AEO mutual recognition arrangements (MRAs) with 16 economies, ranking fourth globally in terms of the number of MRAs after Mainland China, Korea and the United States. The C&ED has been proactively expanding the global network of AEO MRAs with good progress made in recent years. It has signed action plans for AEO MRAs with eight economies including Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, Cambodia, the Philippines, the United Arab Emirates, Laos, Peru and Chile, marking a significant step towards the conclusion of the MRAs by both sides. The C&ED is now actively engaged in discussions and follow-up work with the customs administrations of these economies regarding the MRAs.

  Looking ahead, the C&ED will continue its efforts to expand the MRA network by actively liaising with Hong Kong's major trading partners and dovetailing with the national development strategy on the Belt and Road Initiative. Priority will be given to discussing the MRAs with Belt and Road economies, including member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, and economies in the South American and African regions, with a view to benefitting more enterprises.

  To encourage local enterprises to become Hong Kong AEOs, the C&ED has continuously collaborated with the industry, major chambers of commerce and relevant partners to organise different types of publicity and promotional events, including briefing sessions and exhibition booths, to enhance enterprises' understanding of the Hong Kong AEO Programme. Last year, the C&ED set up exhibition booths and hosted thematic seminars at major events, such as the Belt and Road Summit jointly organised by the Belt and Road Office and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), as well as the Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference organised by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the HKTDC, with a view to fostering exchanges with different fields and industries. In addition, the C&ED has been disseminating the latest information on the developments of local and global AEO programmes through its website and social media channels, so as to extend the reach of its publicity and promotional efforts as well as strengthen communication and engagement with stakeholders.

  To further enhance the appeal of the Hong Kong AEO Programme, the C&ED has been actively seeking co-operation with various organisations to offer more benefits to the AEOs. For instance, the C&ED collaborates with the Hong Kong Export Credit Insurance Corporation to provide Hong Kong AEOs with free buyers' credit checks to help them cope with market risks. In addition, the C&ED signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Enhancing AEO Co-operation in the Greater Bay Area among Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao Customs under the AEO MRAs with the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China and the Macao Customs Service in 2023. Through such initiatives as the mutual referral mechanism on AEO applications, enhanced joint publicity and staff training, the MoU deepens the co-operation among the three customs administrations and supports enterprises of the three places to seize development opportunities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area."

""The public should carry and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration while engaging in outdoor activities,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

""Those engaged in strenuous outdoor activities should avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcohol, as they speed up water loss through the urinary system,"" the spokesman explained.

""Infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and individuals who are overweight are more vulnerable to heat stroke. They should pay special attention,"" the spokesman added.

The public should adopt the following precautions:


Wear loose and light-coloured clothing to reduce heat absorption and facilitate sweat evaporation and heat dissipation;
Avoid vigorous exercise and prolonged activities like hiking or trekking as heat, sweating and exhaustion can place additional demands on the physique;
Perform outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible;
For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;
Apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen product with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply every two hours if you need to stay outdoors for a prolonged period, or after swimming, sweating or towelling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear long-sleeved and loose-fitting clothes; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.

展覽由康樂及文化事務署（康文署）主辦、香港藝術館和香港中文大學文物館聯合籌劃。康文署署長陳詠雯今日（六月十日）在展覽開幕典禮上致辭時表示，二十世紀中大量中國書畫及文物珍品輾轉流入香港，外國畫商和收藏家爭相搶購。三位收藏家希望將國粹留在中華大地，竭力搜羅中國歷代書畫珍品，因而創建了虛白齋、至樂樓及北山堂這三批世界級的私人珍藏。他們及其家人更將珍藏饋贈香港藝術館和香港中文大學文物館，作公開展示和教育用途，讓大眾了解鑑賞中國書畫之道。三位藏家及其家族盡心保護和推廣中華文化，彰顯化私為公的高尚情操。

其他主禮嘉賓包括香港中文大學副校長陳德章教授、北山堂基金行政總裁江馨平、博物館諮詢委員會藝術專責委員會主席許焯權教授，以及香港藝術館總館長莫家詠博士。

三大古書畫收藏各具特色。虛白齋藏品涵蓋了明清時期的主要流派，全面而清晰地反映中國書畫藝術傳統發展的脈絡。精選展品包括董其昌的《山水行書合冊》、傳為馬和之所繪的《齊風六篇》、張風的《古木高士圖》和羅聘的《鬼趣圖》等。

至樂樓以「先人品而後藝事」作為其收藏的先決條件，藏品以明末清初的書畫最為豐富。精選展品包括黃道周的《松石圖》、朱耷（八大山人）的《山水冊》、吳彬的《煙江疊嶂圖》和今釋的《行草書詩文冊》等。

北山堂的收藏書畫兼重，涵蓋歷朝，以明清之作居多，當中有孤本罕品，也有名家翰墨。精選展品包括文徵明的《行書寄金陵友人詞》、陶鉉的《幽亭遠岫圖》、王寵的《行書借券》和南宋時期的《庭園雪霽圖》等。

香港藝術館亦邀請了本地藝術家邱榮豐，以三大收藏中明末清初畫家黃向堅《尋親圖》系列中多變的視角及誇張變形的山石造境為啟發，創作兩組藝術裝置作品《迴渡》及《蜃曲》，用當代的角度重新詮釋一個獨特的香港十八區山水故事。

展覽在九龍尖沙咀梳士巴利道十號香港藝術館四樓至樂樓藏中國書畫館、吳冠中藝術廳及靜觀樓藏品廳舉行，免費入場。展覽得到北山堂基金贊助出版展覽圖錄及舉辦國際學術講座系列，邀請海內外專家學者主講，帶領觀眾從深度學術角度欣賞中國古代書畫珍品，了解各地中國書畫的收藏歷史。有關展覽及相關活動詳情，請瀏覽網頁https://hk.art.museum/tc/web/ma/exhibitions-and-events/the-pride-of-hong-kong.html。​

HKMoA's new exhibition unveils and showcases three preeminent collections in Hong Kong for first time (with photos),2025-06-10 20:40,2025-06-10 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000317.htm,"The Hong Kong Museum of Art (HKMoA) will launch the exhibition ""The Pride of Hong Kong: Three Preeminent Collections of Ancient Paintings and Calligraphies"" from June 11 to October 7, converging for the first time treasures from three world-class collections - Xubaizhai, established by the late renowned local collector Low Chuck-tiew; Chih Lo Lou, by Ho Iu-kwong; and Bei Shan Tang, by Lee Jung-sen, which are highly revered locally and internationally. Ninety-three sets of masterpieces from the Tang to the Qing dynasties will be exhibited, showcasing Hong Kong's golden age of collecting.

The exhibition, presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, is jointly organised by the HKMoA and the Art Museum of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Addressing the opening ceremony held today (June 10), the Director of Leisure and Cultural Services, Ms Manda Chan, said that in the mid-20th century, Chinese national treasures were featured in a large quantity in Hong Kong. Foreign art dealers and collectors were highly enthusiastic to acquire these treasures. With the resolve to retain these embodiments of Chinese heritage on home soil, the three collectors were determined to collect ancient Chinese masterpieces. The three world-class private treasured collections, namely Xubaizhai, Chih Lo Lou and Bei Shan Tang, were thus built up. Moreover, the three collectors and their families donated their invaluable collections to the HKMoA and the Art Museum of the CUHK for exhibition and educational purposes, providing the public with the opportunity to appreciate Chinese painting and calligraphy. The three collectors and their families, committed to preserving and promoting Chinese culture, have demonstrated their honourable generosity.

Other officiating guests included Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the CUHK Professor Anthony Chan; the Chief Executive Officer of Bei Shan Tang Foundation, Ms Lillian Kiang; the Chairman of the Art Sub-committee of the Museum Advisory Committee, Professor Desmond Hui; and the Museum Director of the HKMoA, Dr Maria Mok.

The three preeminent collections stand out in distinctiveness. The Xubaizhai Collection covers the major Ming and Qing schools, fully epitomising the development of Chinese painting and calligraphy traditions. Highlight exhibits include Dong Qichang's ""Landscape and Calligraphy in Running Script"", ""Illustrations for the Odes of Qi"" attributed to Ma Hezhi, Zhang Feng's ""Scholar by an Old Tree"" and Luo Pin's ""The Realm of Ghosts"".

The Chih Lo Lou Collection, under the guiding collecting principle of ""artist before his art"", emphasises works from the Ming-Qing transition. Huang Daozhou's ""Pines and Rock"", Zhu Da (Bada Shanren)'s ""Landscapes"", Wu Bin's ""Misty River and Piled Peaks"" and Jinshi's ""Poems and Essays in Running-cursive Script"" are some of the highlight exhibits.

The Bei Shan Tang Collection, rich in both paintings and calligraphies spanning a number of dynasties, especially the Ming and Qing periods, is notable for its leading masters, while some of the works are rare or the only extant pieces by the respective artists. Highlight exhibits include Wen Zhengming's ""Ci-poem for Xu Lin in Running Script"", Tao Xuan's ""Pavilion against Distant Mountains"", and Wang Chong's ""Loan Agreement in Running Script"" and ""Garden after Snow"" during the Southern Song dynasty.

The HKMoA has also invited Hong Kong artist Yau Wing-fung to draw inspiration from the varied perspectives and stylised rocks and mountains in late Ming and early Qing painter Huang Xiangjian's depictions of his reunion journeys in the three preeminent collections, and to create two installations ""To and Fro"" and ""Mirage Harmony"", which retell the unique story of the distinctive landforms of Hong Kong's 18 administrative districts from a contemporary perspective.

The exhibition will be held at the Chih Lo Lou Gallery of Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, the Wu Guanzhong Art Gallery and the Jingguanlou Gallery on the fourth floor of the HKMoA (10 Salisbury Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon). Admission is free. Sponsored by Bei Shan Tang Foundation, the exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue and an international academic lecture series. Scholars from the region and overseas will deliver talks on appreciating Chinese paintings and calligraphy, as well as the history of Chinese art collections in various places. For details of the exhibition and related activities, please visit the website at hk.art.museum/en/web/ma/exhibitions-and-events/the-pride-of-hong-kong.html.

The exhibition is also one of the activities in the Chinese Culture Promotion Series."

​水務署註冊用戶因沒有為懷疑濫收水費個案提供資料罪成,2025-06-10 20:25,2025-06-10 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000567.htm,"水務署公布，一間有限公司因沒有遵從水務監督要求為懷疑濫收水費個案提供有關資料或文件，違反《水務設施規例》第47A條，今日（六月十日）在東區裁判法院承認控罪。該公司為香港鰂魚涌一劏房的水務署註冊用戶。

水務署發言人表示，《2024年水務設施（修訂）條例》（修訂條例）加強水務監督在調查懷疑濫收水費個案時取證和披露資料的權力，要求業主和其代理人等提交租約、水費收據或付款紀錄，沒有遵從要求可被視作違例，一經定罪可處罰款最高10,000元，以及可就罪行持續期間每日另處罰款最高1,000元，預期檢控個案的數量將會增加。修訂條例提高濫收水費的罰款至最高25,000元，從而打擊濫收水費的違法行為。此外，向水務監督提供虛假或具誤導性資料屬犯罪，最高刑罰為罰款25,000元及監禁六個月。

發言人強烈勸諭業主為其劏房租戶申請安裝獨立水錶，以減低違反修訂條例的風險。水務署鼓勵公眾舉報濫收水費的非法行為，以便該署跟進及調查。市民可致電水務署熱線3468 4963或透過WhatsApp專線5665 5517申請為劏房租戶安裝獨立水錶。該署WhatsApp專線亦會處理濫收劏房租戶水費事宜。此外，市民亦可致電水務署客戶諮詢熱線2824 5000舉報濫收劏房租戶水費，接通並選擇語言後，再按「7」字，便可直接向職員舉報。"
WSD-registered consumer convicted of failing to provide relevant information or documents for suspected case of overcharging for water,2025-06-10 20:25,2025-06-10 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000565.htm,"The Water Supplies Department (WSD) announced that alimited company was convicted today (June 10) of failing to comply with the Water Authority's request to provide relevant information or documents for a suspected case of overcharging for water, in contravention of regulation 47A of the Waterworks Regulations. The consumer pleaded guilty to the offence at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. The company is a WSD-registered consumer of a subdivided unit (SDU) in Quarry Bay, Hong Kong.

A spokesman for the WSD said that the Waterworks (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 (the amended WWO) has strengthened the power of the Water Authority in evidence collection and information disclosure during the investigation of suspected cases of overcharging for water. The Water Authority can request the landlords, their agents, etc, to provide the tenancy agreement, receipt or payment record for charges for water. Failure to comply with such a request can be an offence, and the offender is liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $10,000 and a further fine of up to $1,000 for each day the offence continues. It is anticipated that there will be more prosecution cases. The maximum penalty for overcharging tenants of SDUs for water has been raised to $25,000 to deter this illegal act. Moreover, providing false or misleading information to the Water Authority is also an offence with a maximum penalty of a $25,000 fine and six months' imprisonment.

  The WSD spokesman strongly appealed to landlords to apply for the installation of separate water meters for their SDUs, which can greatly reduce the risk of contravening the amended WWO. The WSD encourages the public to report any illegal act of overcharging SDU tenants for water for follow-up and investigation by the department. The public can call the WSD Hotline 3468 4963 or WhatsApp 5665 5517 to apply for the installation of separate water meters for SDUs. The WhatsApp hotline also handles matters relating to water overcharging in SDUs. Alternatively, the public can call the WSD Customer Enquiry Hotline 2824 5000 to report water overcharge cases. After calling the hotline and choosing a language, they can press ""7"" for reporting to staff directly."

   行動期間，漁護署人員於長洲附近水域發現一艘本地漁船涉嫌非法使用蛇籠（一種已被禁止在香港水域使用的浸籠）捕魚，遂於晚上約九時三十分截停有關船隻進行調查。漁護署其後從船上檢走一批捕魚工具（包括蛇籠和絞轆）。

   漁護署現正從涉嫌以蛇籠捕魚並違反《漁業保護條例》（第171章）的方向，調查船上一名本地船長及六名內地過港漁工。

任何人士在本港水域使用船隻捕魚時，其船隻必須已根據《漁業保護條例》登記及按其本地漁船登記證明書上所列出的捕魚方法捕魚。本地漁船登記證明書有關浸籠部分的登記條件亦指明任何摺疊式浸籠不得以任何方式與另一浸籠連接，或其任何一面伸展後的長度不得超過五米。因此，使用蛇籠捕魚亦屬違法。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款10萬元及監禁六個月。

漁護署發言人強調︰「政府一直致力打擊香港水域的非法捕魚活動，漁護署會繼續加強巡邏和嚴格執法。」"
AFCD investigates Mainland fisherman deckhands and local coxswain suspected of using snake cages for fishing (with photo),2025-06-10 20:05,2025-06-10 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000768.htm," A joint operation was conducted by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) together with the Hong Kong Police Force and Zhuhai Municipal Marine Comprehensive Law Enforcement Team in the southern waters of Hong Kong yesterday (June 9).

  During the operation, the AFCD personnel intercepted a local fishing vessel suspected of engaging in fishing using snake cages (a type of cage trap banned in Hong Kong waters) in waters off Cheung Chau at around 9.30pm for investigation. Some fishing gear (including snake cages and winches) on board was seized by the AFCD.

 The AFCD is investigating a local coxswain and six Mainland fisherman deckhands on board suspected of engaging in fishing using snake cages, in violation of the Fisheries Protection Ordinance (Cap. 171).

 Only a vessel registered under the Ordinance can be used for fishing in Hong Kong waters and only the fishing methods listed on its Certificate of Registration of Local Fishing Vessel can be employed for fishing by the vessel. The conditions of the Certificate of Registration of Local Fishing Vessel regarding cage traps also stipulate that any collapsible cage traps should not be connected in any way to another; or should not exceed five metres in any of its extended dimensions. Hence, it is unlawful to fish using snake cages. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of $100,000 and six months' imprisonment upon conviction.

 A spokesman for the AFCD stressed, ""The Government is committed to combatting illegal fishing activities in Hong Kong waters. The AFCD will continue to step up patrols and take stringent enforcement action."""

  The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) hosted the Estate Management Services Contractors Awards (EMSC Awards) 2024 presentation ceremony at Domain in Yau Tong today (June 10). A total of 90 awards were presented to the estate management services contractors and frontline staff in recognition of their outstanding performances in managing the HA's properties last year.

  The HA introduced a new award this year to recognise the significant contributions of outstanding frontline staff on combating tenancy abuse, in appreciation of their efforts in safeguarding this valuable housing resource.

  Officiating at the presentation ceremony, the Deputy Director of Housing (Estate Management), Mr Ricky Yeung, said, ""Public housing resources are precious and should be allocated appropriately and rationally to those in genuine need of housing. The HA has been committed to combating tenancy abuse in public housing. We are encouraging services contractors to collaborate with us in safeguarding these housing resources.

  ""We have implemented a reward mechanism in the service contractor evaluation system, whereby services contractors who perform well in combating tenancy abuse will receive additional points, enhancing their bidding and contracting opportunities. Indeed, the effectiveness of the assistance provided by frontline staff of services contractors to our colleagues in detecting cases has been significant, helping our work in combating tenancy abuse achieve the desired results.""

  The EMSC Awards in 2024 went to 17 services contractors providing property management, cleaning, security and car park operating services. Eight property services managers and 56 frontline staff members were also commended. The full list of awardees is in the Annex.

  The estates managed by the winners of the Best Public Rental Housing Estate (Property Services) Large Estate award this year include Tin Yiu (I) & Tin Yiu (II) Estate, Choi Yuen Estate, Hau Tak Estate and Shek Lei (II) Estate, while the estates managed by the winners of the Best Public Rental Housing Estate (Property Services) Small Estate award include Wing Cheong Estate, Wah Kwai Estate (Wah Oi House) and Lung Yat Estate.

  Currently, the management of more than half of the HA's public rental housing estates is outsourced to property services contractors, and many major maintenance tasks in the HA estates are being supervised by them. By leveraging the private sector's resources and experience in managing private properties, the HA seeks to continuously raise the quality of its estate management services and provide a pleasant living environment for its tenants."

房委會今年特別增設獎項，嘉許在打擊濫用公屋方面有重大貢獻的傑出前線人員，感謝他們竭力維護寶貴的公屋資源。

  房屋署副署長（屋邨管理）楊耀輝在頒獎禮上表示：「公共房屋是社會的寶貴資源，我們必須善用及合理編配給真正有住屋需要的人士。房委會一直致力打擊濫用公屋行為（『打濫』），我們鼓勵服務承辦商與我們合力維護公屋資源。」

他說：「我們已在服務承辦商評分制度中設立獎勵機制，『打濫』表現良好的服務承辦商會獲額外加分，有助增加投標和中標機會。事實上，服務承辦商前線員工在偵測個案方面給予我們同事的協助，成效十分顯著，讓我們的『打濫』工作取得理想成績。」

  二○二四年度的獎項名單中，共有17間為房委會提供物業管理、清潔、保安和停車場管理服務的承辦商獲獎；另外亦有八名物業服務經理和56名前線員工獲得嘉許。得獎名單詳見附表。

The event provided deep insights into Hong Kong's latest policy developments including family office policies and tax incentives. The session was well received, drawing participation from over 60 representatives of legal and professional firms serving high-net-worth clients. The event sparked active discussions, with participants expressing keen interest and strong confidence in the evolving role of Hong Kong's professional services sector and the future of Hong Kong's family office ecosystem.

Key topics covered included interpretation of Hong Kong's latest family office policies, comparisons with regional regimes and tax incentives, case studies and a question-and-answer session. The session aimed to enhance understanding among legal and advisory firms of Hong Kong's policy landscape, strengthen participant's positioning as cross-border advisors to ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs), and facilitate the development of business networks in Hong Kong.

Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK Mr Charles Ng said, ""Hong Kong is the leading hub for asset and wealth management in Asia with over US$4 trillion in assets under management. Our city is recognised as a trusted gateway for global capital seeking access to opportunities across Asia and beyond. Our leadership is further evidenced by our standing as Asia's largest hedge fund hub and Asia's largest cross-border wealth management centre. The professional services sector plays a strategic and indispensable role in enabling this ecosystem to flourish. InvestHK is committed to working closely with legal, accounting, trust, and advisory professionals to promote policy understanding and strengthen Hong Kong's competitiveness in cross-border wealth management and succession planning.""

Legal professionals attending the event provided perspectives on Hong Kong's family office policies and the growing opportunities arising from them. The Chair of the Family Office Committee at the Law Society of Hong Kong, Mr Chan Chak-ming, said, ""With increasing interest from UHNWIs in Asia, Hong Kong's forward-looking initiatives, including tax incentives and efficient market processes, solidify its position as the region's leading destination for family offices. Together with InvestHK, we aim to strengthen Hong Kong's role as a nexus for global wealth, ensuring it remains responsive to the sophisticated needs of UHNWIs while reinforcing trust and long-term confidence.""

InvestHK will continue to collaborate with industry stakeholders to support legal and advisory firms in expanding their high-end wealth services in Hong Kong, and to promote the city as a premier hub for family offices and a cross-border wealth management centre in Asia, helping Mainland and international families of UHNWIs achieve long-term goals in asset growth and succession."

Mr Nick Chan (Director of the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre), Deputy Commissioner Mr Fang Jianming (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), heads of AALCO disputes resolution centres, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  A very good afternoon. It is both an honour and a privilege to stand before you today as we mark a significant milestone - the third anniversary of the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre. Over the past three years, AALCO Hong Kong has not only flourished but has also become a cornerstone of Hong Kong's reputation as a world-class destination for international dispute resolution. Today, we celebrate not just an institution, but a shared vision: a future where Hong Kong continues to maintain and strengthen our status as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.

  Three years ago, AALCO's choice to establish its newest regional arbitration centre in Hong Kong reflected AALCO members' resounding confidence in our city's rule of law, legal talent, and many other unique advantages as an international financial centre and legal services and disputes resolution centre under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", and of course, also Hong Kong's location, being the heart of the Greater Bay Area (GBA) development and an important gateway of the Belt and Road Initiative.

  Since its establishment, AALCO Hong Kong has made significant contributions in enhancing Hong Kong's regional arbitration capabilities. By providing a neutral and efficient platform for dispute resolution, AALCO Hong Kong has facilitated the settlement of cross-border commercial disputes, reinforcing confidence in the legal systems of Asian and African economies.

  AALCO Hong Kong has also organised various seminars and training programmes for capacity building of dispute resolution professionals and international collaboration by working closely with governments, arbitral institutions, and legal bodies to harmonise arbitration practices across different jurisdictions, especially in the GBA and the Belt and Road regions. For example, we are very happy to see that AALCO Hong Kong supported the Second Instalment of the 7th Belt and Road Conference hosted by the Law Society of Hong Kong, which featured engaging and fruitful dialogues in promoting a peaceful dispute resolution worldwide.

  I wish to extend my deepest congratulations and gratitude to AALCO, the legal community, and all stakeholders who have supported AALCO Hong Kong's growth. This milestone is not just a proof to AALCO Hong Kong's achievements over the past three years, but also a reflection of Hong Kong's growing role as a leading hub for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. As we look ahead, the demand for arbitration and alternative dispute resolution (ADR) services will grow, driven by increasing cross-border trade, Belt and Road Initiative projects, digital economy disputes, and international sports events.

  Let us reaffirm our commitment to advancing the edge of arbitration, promoting ADR, and building a more interconnected legal and dispute resolution landscape for Asia, Africa, and beyond. To conclude, I wish AALCO Hong Kong many more years of success. Thank you."

Police remind public not to download or provide funding to mobile application endangering national security,2025-06-10 17:59,2025-06-10 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000697.htm,"ÂÂÂ The National Security Department (NSD) of the Hong Kong Police Force reminds the public today (June 10) not to download a mobile application named ""Reversed Front: Bonfire"" or provide funding to the application developer for engaging in acts and activities endangering national security.

ÂÂÂ ""Reversed Front: Bonfire"" was released under the guise of a game with the aim of promoting secessionist agendas such as ""Taiwan independence"" and ""Hong Kong independence"", advocating armed revolution and the overthrow of the fundamental system of the Peopleâs Republic of China established by the Constitution of the Peopleâs Republic of China. It also has an intention to provoke hatred towards the Central Authorities and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Any person or organisation who knowingly publishes the application or related content, including sharing or recommending the application to others via the Internet, may commit the offence of ""incitement to secession"" under Article 21 and the offence of ""incitement to subversion"" under Article 23 of the Hong Kong National Security Law, as well as ""offences in connection with seditious intention"" under Section 24 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.

ÂÂÂ In addition, those who have downloaded the application may be regarded as in possession of a publication that has a seditious intention. Under Section 24 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, a person who, without reasonable excuse, possesses a publication that has a seditious intention, commits an offence. A person who provides pecuniary or other financial assistance or property to the application developer, including making payment through in-app purchases, with an intent to provide funding to the relevant developer for the commission of secession or subversion, also commits an offence.

ÂÂÂ With the approval of the Secretary for Security, NSD has implemented disabling action on electronic messages related to ""Reversed Front: Bonfire"" in accordance with Schedule 4 to the Implementation Rules for Article 43 of the Hong Kong National Security Law.

二零二五年第一季服務行業按季業務收益指數,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000379.htm,"政府統計處今日（六月十日）發表的業務收益指數的臨時數字顯示，二零二五年第一季與二零二四年第一季比較，不少主要服務行業以價值計算的業務收益均有不同程度的升幅。

二零二五年第一季與二零二四年第一季比較，金融業（銀行除外）（+32.5%）、保險業（+23.1%）、進出口貿易業（+19.4%）及銀行業（+19.0%）的業務收益指數均錄得雙位數升幅。另一方面，地產業（-6.7%）及零售業（-6.5%）的業務收益指數同期則錄得跌幅。

按服務界別分析，電腦及資訊科技服務界別的業務收益指數同期按年上升60.2%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別的業務收益指數亦按年上升1.1%。

二零二五年第一季與二零二四年第四季比較，不少主要服務行業經季節性調整的業務收益（以價值計算）均錄得不同程度的升幅。當中，保險業（+32.5%）、進出口貿易業（+20.3%）及銀行業（+19.9%）的業務收益指數均錄得雙位數升幅。另一方面，地產業的業務收益指數同期則下跌5.7%。

按服務界別分析，二零二五年第一季與二零二四年第四季比較，電腦及資訊科技服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數上升50.3%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數亦上升0.7%。

評論

政府發言人表示，二零二五年第一季不少服務行業的業務收益較去年同期上升。較顯著的升幅見於金融業（銀行除外）、保險業、進出口貿易業，以及銀行業。

展望未來，經濟增長應為服務行業的業務提供支持。內地經濟繼續增長和香港政府各項增強經濟動能的措施應有利服務行業的業務，儘管一些行業或會受外圍環境的不確定性及市民和旅客於本地市場的消費模式轉變帶來的持續不利因素所影響。

進一步資料

表1載列最近五季選定服務行業及服務界別的業務收益指數及其相應按年變動百分率，而表2則載列最近五季經季節性調整的業務收益指數按季變動百分率。

二零二五年第一季的業務收益指數的修訂數字將於二零二五年七月十八日在政府統計處網站(www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/web_table.html?id=660-69001)發布。

編製業務收益指數所用的數據主要來自政府統計處進行的「服務行業按季統計調查」，並輔以香港金融管理局及香港旅遊發展局提供的有關數據。

服務界別有別於服務行業，前者包括橫跨不同行業但與某個共同主題相關的經濟活動。服務界別可能包括某個服務行業內所有機構單位進行的全部經濟活動，而該服務行業與該服務界別關係密切。然而，在一個與該服務界別關係不太密切的服務行業內，只有部分機構單位甚或只有這些機構單位的部分經濟活動是與該服務界別有關。以旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別為例，這界別包括所有會議展覽機構的服務、短期住宿服務及旅行社所提供的服務，以及食肆、零售商及運輸服務營辦商的部分服務（只包括以旅客為對象的服務）。

服務行業的分類是採用「香港標準行業分類2.0版」。該行業分類用於各類經濟統計調查，把經濟單位分類歸入合適的行業類別。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《二零二五年第一季服務行業按季業務收益指數》報告內。用戶可於政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080006&scode=520）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

二零二五年第一季建造工程完成量統計數字,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000354.htm,"政府統計處今日（六月十日）公布「建造工程完成量按季統計調查」的臨時結果。主要承建商於二零二五年第一季所完成的建造工程名義總值的總計為705億元，較上年同期上升1.9%。

剔除價格變動的影響後，臨時結果顯示以實質計算，主要承建商所完成的建造工程總值的總計於同期間輕微下跌0.9%。以實質計算的建造工程完成量總值，是透過適當的物價指數去平減相應的建造工程完成量名義總值至二零零零年基期的價格水平計算而成。

按建造工程類別分析，於二零二五年第一季完成的私人地盤建造工程名義總值為194億元，較上年同期下跌10.7%。以實質計算，跌幅為12.7%。於二零二五年第一季完成的公營地盤建造工程名義總值較上年同期上升17.4%至305億元。以實質計算，升幅為13.8%。

主要承建商於二零二五年第一季所完成的非地盤建造工程名義總值為206億元，較上年同期下跌3.9%。以實質計算，跌幅為5.7%。非地盤建造工程包括小規模新建工程及樓房裝飾、樓宇修葺及保養工程，和非地盤的電器設備安裝及保養工程。

按主要用途類別分析，住宅樓宇建造工程於二零二五年第一季完成的地盤建造工程名義總值為209億元，較上年同期上升5.0%。同期間，運輸工程於二零二五年第一季完成的地盤建造工程名義總值下跌19.4%至88億元。

以經季節性調整的數字按季比較，主要承建商於二零二五年第一季完成的建造工程名義總值較二零二四年第四季輕微上升0.1%。以實質計算，則下跌1.0%。

主要承建商於二零二五年第一季所完成的建造工程總值臨時數字列載於表1。二零二四年全年及第四季的修訂數字則分別列載於表2及表3。

由於分判建造工程在建造業內十分普遍，一間建造業機構可以是某一合約的主要承建商，同時亦可以是另一合約的分判承建商。主要承建商所完成的建造工程總值，只包括該等建造業機構作為主要承建商合約中所完成的建造工程，而不包括其作為分判承建商所完成的建造工程。然而，分判承建商所完成的建造工程總值，應已包括在其受聘的主要承建商所完成的建造工程總值之內。

建造業機構單位的分類是採用「香港標準行業分類2.0版」。該行業分類用於各經濟統計調查，把經濟單位撥歸不同的行業類別。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《建造工程完成量按季統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1090002&scode=330）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

二零二五年五月份中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查結果,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000328.htm,"政府統計處今日（六月十日）發表二零二五年五月份中小型企業（中小企）業務狀況按月統計調查的結果。

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年四月在收縮區域的41.2上升至二零二五年五月的42.1，而未來一個月（即二零二五年六月）的業務收益展望動向指數為45.4。按行業分析，業務收益現時動向指數雖低於50的分界線，但不少統計調查涵蓋的行業的相關指數在二零二五年五月較上月上升，特別是進出口貿易業（從40.2上升至41.9）及批發業（從40.0上升至41.5）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數從二零二五年四月的42.0上升至二零二五年五月的44.0，而未來一個月（即二零二五年六月）的新訂單展望動向指數為45.8。

評論

政府發言人表示，隨着環球貿易摩擦略見緩和，五月中小企的營商氣氛和對未來一個月的預期均有所改善。整體就業情況亦略為好轉。

展望未來，外圍環境的不確定性會繼續影響營商氣氛。然而，本地經濟表現強韌，內地經濟持續穩步增長，應可提供有力支持。政府會繼續密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指就業人數少於50人的機構單位。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於大規模機構單位的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己機構單位情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for May 2025,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000333.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (June 10) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for May 2025.

  The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs increased from 41.2 in April 2025 in the contractionary zone to 42.1 in May 2025, whereas the one-month's ahead (i.e. June 2025) outlook DI on business receipts was 45.4. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts, despite below the 50-mark, rose in May 2025 as compared with previous month for many surveyed sectors, particularly for the import and export trades (from 40.2 to 41.9) and wholesale trade (from 40.0 to 41.5).

  The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades increased from 42.0 in April 2025 to 44.0 in May 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month’s time (i.e. June 2025) was 45.8.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business sentiment among SMEs and their outlook in one month's time saw some improvement in May, as the global trade tensions eased somewhat. The overall employment situation also turned slightly better.

  Looking ahead, the uncertain external environment could continue to affect business sentiment. Nonetheless, the resilient local economy and sustained steady growth in the Mainland economy should provide a solid backstop. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.

Further information

  The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to establishments with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent establishments in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

  The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own establishments rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

Quarterly business receipts indices for service industries for first quarter of 2025,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000391.htm,"  Business receipts in value terms of many major service industries showed increases of varying magnitudes in the first quarter of 2025 when compared with the first quarter of 2024, according to the provisional figures of business receipts indices released today (June 10) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

  Comparing the first quarter of 2025 with the first quarter of 2024, double-digit increases were recorded in business receipts indices of the financing (except banking) (+32.5%), insurance (+23.1%), import/export trade (+19.4%) and banking (+19.0%) industries. On the other hand, decreases were recorded in business receipts indices of the real estate (-6.7%) and retail (-6.5%) industries during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 60.2% year-on-year during the same period, while that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain also increased by 1.1% year-on-year.

  On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison, business receipts in value terms of many major service industries recorded increases of varying magnitudes in the first quarter of 2025 when compared with the fourth quarter of 2024. In particular, double-digit increases were recorded in business receipts indices of the insurance (+32.5%), import/export trade (+20.3%) and banking (+19.9%) industries. On the other hand, business receipts index of the real estate industry decreased by 5.7% during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, comparing the first quarter of 2025 with the fourth quarter of 2024 on a seasonally adjusted basis, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 50.3%, while that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain also increased by 0.7%.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business receipts of many service industries recorded increases in the first quarter of 2025 over a year earlier. More notable increases in business receipts were seen for the financing (except banking), insurance, import/export trade and banking industries.

  Looking ahead, business of the service industries should be supported by economic growth. Continued growth of the Mainland economy and the Hong Kong Government's various measures to boost economic momentum should be conducive to the businesses of the services industries, though some industries may be affected by the continued headwinds stemming from the uncertainties in the external environment and the changing consumption patterns of residents and visitors in the local market.

Further information

  Table 1 presents the business receipts indices and their corresponding year-on-year rates of change in respect of selected service industries and service domains for the recent five quarters, while Table 2 shows the corresponding quarter-to-quarter rates of change in the business receipts indices for the recent five quarters based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The revised figures of business receipts indices for the first quarter of 2025 will be released at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/web_table.html?id=660-69001) on July 18, 2025.

  Data for compiling the business receipts indices are mainly based on the Quarterly Survey of Service Industries conducted by the C&SD, supplemented by relevant data provided by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Tourism Board.

  A service domain differs from a service industry in that it comprises those economic activities which straddle different industries but are somehow related to a common theme. It may include all activities carried out by all establishments in a service industry that is closely related to the domain. For a service industry that is less closely related, however, only a portion of the establishments in the industry or even only part of the economic activities of the establishments is related to the domain. Taking the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain as an example, it includes all services of convention and exhibition organisers, short-term accommodation services and services of travel agents, and some of the services (only those involving visitors as customers) of restaurants, retailers and transport operators.

  The classification of service industries follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into relevant industry classes.

  More detailed statistics are given in the report ""Quarterly Business Receipts Indices for Service Industries, First Quarter 2025"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080006&scode=520).

Construction output for first quarter of 2025,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000355.htm,"  The total gross value of construction works (GVCW) performed by main contractors in the first quarter of 2025 increased by 1.9% in nominal terms over a year earlier to $70.5 billion, according to the provisional results of the Quarterly Survey of Construction Output released today (June 10) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

  After discounting the effect of price changes, the provisional results showed that the total GVCW performed by main contractors slightly decreased by 0.9% in real terms over the same period. GVCW in real terms is derived by deflating the corresponding nominal value with an appropriate price index to the price level in the base period of 2000.

  Analysed by type of construction works, the GVCW performed at private sector sites totalled $19.4 billion in the first quarter of 2025, down by 10.7% in nominal terms over a year earlier. In real terms, it decreased by 12.7%. The GVCW performed at public sector sites increased by 17.4% in nominal terms over a year earlier to $30.5 billion in the first quarter of 2025. In real terms, it increased by 13.8%.

  The GVCW performed by main contractors at locations other than construction sites amounted to $20.6 billion in the first quarter of 2025, down by 3.9% in nominal terms compared with a year earlier. In real terms, it decreased by 5.7%. Construction works at locations other than construction sites included minor new construction activities and decoration, repair and maintenance for buildings; and electrical equipment installation and maintenance works at locations other than construction sites.

  Analysed by major end-use group, the GVCW performed at construction sites in respect of residential buildings projects amounted to $20.9 billion in the first quarter of 2025, up by 5.0% in nominal terms over a year earlier. Over the same period, the GVCW performed at construction sites in respect of transport projects down by 19.4% in nominal terms to $8.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, the GVCW performed by main contractors slightly increased by 0.1% in nominal terms but decreased by 1.0% in real terms in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the fourth quarter of 2024.

  Table 1 shows the provisional figures on the GVCW performed by main contractors in the first quarter of 2025. Tables 2 and 3 show the revised figures for the whole year of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2024 respectively.

  Owing to the widespread sub-contracting practices in the construction industry, a construction establishment can be a main contractor for one contract and a sub-contractor for another contract at the same time. The GVCW performed by main contractors covers only those projects in which the construction establishment takes the role of a main contractor, but not projects in which it takes only the role of a sub-contractor. However, sub-contractors' contribution to projects should have been included in the GVCW performed by main contractors for whom they worked.

  The classification of construction establishments follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into different industry classes.
