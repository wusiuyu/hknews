​特區政府強烈不滿和反對歐洲聯盟委員會年度報告,2025-09-09 23:13,2025-09-09 23:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900882.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（九月九日）就歐洲聯盟（歐盟）委員會及歐洲聯盟外交與安全政策高級代表發表所謂年度報告中針對香港特區維護國家安全、保障人權等方面的不實和偏頗內容，表示強烈不滿和反對。

特區政府發言人強調：「香港特區是中華人民共和國不可分離的部分，在『一國兩制』下是一個享有高度自治權、直轄於中央人民政府的地方行政區域。『一國兩制』的實施以《憲法》和《基本法》為法律依據，它們為基本權利和自由提供憲制上的保證，包括法律面前一律平等的權利保證，及其在法治和獨立司法權之下得以鞏固。」

「特區政府堅定不移全面準確實施《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》，在依法有效應對、打擊、阻嚇和防止危害國家安全的行為和活動的同時，依法保障香港居民的權利和自由，確保『一國兩制』實踐行穩致遠。特區政府強烈敦促歐盟尊重事實並遵從它們口口聲聲奉行的國際法和國際關係的基本準則，立即停止長臂管轄、干涉純屬中國內政的香港事務。」

維護司法公正和法治精神

特區政府發言人指出：「特區政府維護獨立的司法權，全力支持司法機構依法獨立行使審判權，維護司法公正和法治精神。建立香港特區維護國家安全的機制不會損害獨立司法權，香港特區司法制度亦繼續受《基本法》保障。法官在處理危害國家安全犯罪案件時，一如其他案件，都是獨立公正地履行司法職責，不受任何干涉。五年來的實踐證明，法院嚴格按照上述原則處理涉及《香港國安法》的案件。」

「事實上，普通法司法區早已確立司法機關須尊重行政機關對國家安全的判斷這個原則，而上訴法庭在二○二四年五月的一項重要判決中裁定，法院在尊重行政機關對國家安全的判斷的同時，至少在三個範疇下法院會作出判決：第一，涉及受措施影響人士的基本權利；第二，涉及公平審訊規定的爭議；第三，涉及司法公開的問題。」

發言人強調：「香港法治固若金湯、歷久不變。香港法治並無任何倒退，任何指稱香港正成為一個『極權』城市的說法絕非事實。香港的普通法制度是多年來由包括各級法院法官在內的香港司法界和法律界全體共同努力打造和維護，不會因個別海外非常任法官離任而有所改變。儘管有法官離任，兩位海外非常任法官剛於去年和今年獲委任。」

「司法機關依法獨立行使審判權，而所有面對刑事指控的人都享有接受公平審訊的權利。法院嚴格按照證據和所有適用法律判案。案件不會因涉案者的職業、政治理念或背景而在處理上有所不同。控方有責任在毫無合理疑點下證明被告人犯罪，被告人才可被法庭定罪。」

保障權利和自由

特區政府發言人表示：「特區政府堅定維護香港居民受到法律保障的權利和自由。自香港回歸祖國以來，人權一直受到《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實憲制保障。香港特區維護國家安全的法律亦特別重視人權。《香港國安法》第四條和《維護國家安全條例》第2條清楚訂明香港特區維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》、《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港，有關言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會等方面的權利和自由。然而，與世界其他地方一樣，有關權利和自由並非絕對，《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》亦清楚訂明，在有必要保障國家安全、公共安全、公共秩序或他人的權利和自由等情況下，可以依法限制部分權利和自由。」

「但事實上，自《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》實施以來，本港的傳媒環境蓬勃依然。惟部分別有用心人士卻刻意捏造有關香港新聞和言論自由的事實。與世界其他地方一樣，新聞和言論自由並非絕對，傳媒與其他人一樣都有義務遵守所有法律。只要不違法，傳媒繼續享有評論和批評政府施政的自由，全然不受限制。法庭在相關案件的裁決理由也引用了歐洲人權法院關於新聞自由的判例，指出即使是報道涉及備受公眾關注的重要議題，在《歐洲人權公約》下也不享有完全不受限制的言論自由；最重要的一點是，新聞工作者必須按『負責任新聞作業』原則真誠地行事，以準確事實為基礎，並提供準確可靠的資訊，方可獲言論和新聞自由權利保障。」

維護國家安全相關法律

特區政府發言人表示：「根據《聯合國憲章》為基礎的國際法及國際關係，每個國家都會制定維護國家安全法律，這既是主權國家的固有權利，也是國際慣例。歐盟對香港特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制指手畫腳，全然漠視香港特區訂立相關法律的憲制責任和實際需要，以及在維護國家安全的相關法律訂立後，對經濟發展和人權保障所帶來的正面效果，是實實在在的雙重標準。」

「中央二○二○年果斷制定《香港國安法》，特區政府隨即公布實施，填補了香港特區維護國家安全法律制度和執行機制的短板漏洞，效果立竿見影，止暴制亂，讓香港居民重新享有在黑暴期間被剝奪的權利和自由，發揮止暴制亂的作用。《香港國安法》的公布實施成為香港『由亂到治』的分水嶺，『一法安香江』。在二○二四年，香港特區切實履行憲制責任訂立《維護國家安全條例》，完善了特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制。事實上，在《基本法》第二十三條立法諮詢期間，有98.6%的意見表示支持及提出正面意見，反映立法在社會有很強的共識，亦是民心所向。」

「香港特區是法治社會，一直秉持有法必依、違法必究的原則。《香港國安法》第五條和《維護國家安全條例》第2條明確訂明防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪，應當堅持法治原則。香港特區執法部門一直根據證據、嚴格依照法律，以及按有關的人或單位的行為而採取執法行動，與其政治立場、背景或職業無關。」

「由於黎智英案、『35+』串謀顛覆國家政權案及支聯會案等所涉及的法律程序尚在進行中，任何人均不宜評論有關案件。特區政府必須強調，所有案件均嚴格根據證據和依照法律處理，律政司按《基本法》第六十三條主管刑事檢控工作，不受任何干涉，所有檢控決定是基於所有可接納的證據和適用法律進行客觀分析後作出。檢控機關和司法機關嚴格履行《香港國安法》第四十二條第一款的責任，確保所有危害國家安全犯罪案件得到公正、及時辦理，過程中充分尊重被告人依法行使各項程序權利，絕對不存在所謂『延誤審訊』的情況。」

「《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》下危害國家安全罪行的域外效力，完全符合國際法原則、國際慣例和各國各地區通行做法，實屬必要和正當，並與世界其他國家和地區一致。包括歐盟成員國在內眾多國家的國家安全法律，同樣根據『屬人管轄』和『保護管轄』等原則，具有域外效力。」

「警方作為特區維護國家安全的執法部門，有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌危害國家安全的惡行。該等一直潛藏外地的潛逃者被通緝，是因為他們在當地繼續公然從事危害國家安全的勾當，包括煽動分裂國家及請求外國對中華人民共和國及香港特區進行『制裁』、封鎖及採取其他敵對行動，並繼續肆意勾結外部勢力包庇其惡行。他們危害國家安全的惡行昭然若揭，明顯嚴重危害國家安全，無庸置疑。警方作為特區維護國家安全的執法部門，有責任依法進行通緝，及有需要採取一切合法措施，包括《維護國家安全條例》第89條下指明的措施，強烈打擊有關潛逃行為，其做法有理有據，實屬必要和正當。而香港特區維護國家安全相關法律的域外效力，完全符合國際法原則、國際慣例和各國各地區通行做法。不少國家也會就不同的通緝犯施行類似措施，包括撤銷護照。」

「懲教署一直極為重視在囚人士的安全及健康。不論在囚人士的身分、年齡和國籍，署方一直致力為其提供安全、人道、合適和健康的羈管環境，包括提供良好的通風環境、合適和及時的醫療支援。為某囚犯的利益或為維持秩序或紀律，懲教署署長根據《監獄規例》第68B條可作出有關囚犯不應與其他囚犯交往的安排（即所謂的『單獨監禁』）。有關安排的其中一個目的是保障囚犯的人身安全和福祉，可由該囚犯自行提出要求、由懲教署署長依法考慮後審批，或由懲教署署長根據法律規定及程序，在考量了相關的因素後而作出。懲教署也設有一系列機制，例如透過獨立訪客（即太平紳士）定期巡視的安排，以確保在囚人士的權利獲得保障。」

「至於煽動罪方面，香港特區法庭於不同案件中均已確認有關煽動的條文符合《基本法》和《香港人權法案》中有關保障人權的條文，亦確認在維護國家安全和保障言論自由之間已取得相稱而合理的平衡。有關罪行絕非要壓制僅屬根據客觀事實而對政府作出正當批評的言論。事實上，上訴法庭在最近的判決指出，『煽動意圖』的定義與表達自由的基本權利一起正確閱讀時，清晰顯示，批評政府、司法行政包括法院判決，或參與辯論或提出對政府政策或決定的異議，無論多麼強烈、有力或尖銳，都不構成煽動意圖，這進一步澄清了合法和非法言論之間的區別。」

「關於上訴法庭就一首歌曲頒布的臨時禁制令，特區政府重申禁制令針對與該歌曲有關的四項指明刑事行為。為維護國家安全這個正當目的，禁制令是必要、合理、合法、相稱及符合相關人權法案的要求。國際上，很多司法管轄區都有法律機制禁止違法、具有冒犯性、煽動暴力、煽動仇恨或損害公衆利益的信息傳播。例如歐盟的《數字服務法案》規定中介服務供應商收到有關當局要求對非法內容採取行動後，必須及時通知當局其所作的行動；並要求主機服務商須建立機制打擊非法內容及在收到通知後須及時採取應對行動，包括移除及封鎖相關內容。歐盟對特區政府的正當法律行動作出無理批評顯然是持有雙重標準。」

「至於被法庭依法判處在監獄服刑的在囚人士，從來沒有必然獲得提早釋放或者減刑的權利。懲教署署長不轉介犯危害國家安全罪行的在囚人士的個案予監管釋囚委員會，是一項考慮到國家安全的重要性的預防措施，亦有助相關在囚人士改過自新。不轉介有關個案並無增加在囚人士的刑期，也不能被視為對在囚人士的懲罰。法庭亦同意懲教署署長根據《監獄條例》及《監管釋囚條例》賦予的職權行使職務時有責任維護國家安全，亦必須將國家安全視為最重要因素，並給予適當考慮。懲教署一直依法和按既定機制處理有關個案，在決定提早釋放個別在囚人士是否不會不利於國家安全，署長會考慮個案的實際情況及所有相關資料和因素，嚴格依照所有相關法律、公平公正地處理每宗個案。」

「外部勢力『以港遏華』的圖謀無法得逞，只好抹黑詆毀《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》及特區其他相關法律。但事實擺在眼前，香港市民和國際投資者的眼睛都是雪亮的。《香港國安法》實施五年多以來，恢復了香港市民在『黑暴』期間無法享有的權利和自由，以及讓廣大香港市民生活和經濟活動迅速回復正常，營商環境得以恢復並不斷提升。根據《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港的排名躍升兩位至全球第三；香港在全球國際金融中心中位列三甲，並在全球首次公開招股市場中位列前四名。這些國際認可的成就都是建基於《香港國安法》及其他特區相關法律和維護國家安全工作為香港社會帶來的自由、安穩，亦給予世界各地的投資者和企業充足的信心在香港發展業務，及善用香港『一國兩制』的制度優勢開拓包括粵港澳大灣區在內的內地廣大市場。」

「歐盟一再通過所謂年度報告詆毀盡責、忠誠和依法維護國家安全的香港特區，而對相關法律讓廣大香港居民生活和經濟活動回復正常、營商環境恢復的實況置若罔聞。此實乃典型的虛偽『雙標』。歐盟必須立即重回正道，停止抹黑香港特區維護國家安全相關法律和工作。」

加強國民教育

特區政府發言人指出：「學校是學生學習和成長的地方，學校有責任提供安全有序的校園環境和氛圍，防止政治干預或違法活動入侵校園，以保障學生福祉。國民教育一直是香港中小學及幼稚園課程重要部分，以加強學生對國情、歷史和文化、《憲法》和《基本法》、以及國家安全的認識，建立文化自信，提升國民身分認同，培育他們成為德才兼備，有承擔、有視野、愛國愛港的新一代。此外，教師是學生的重要楷模，肩負知識傳承、熏陶品德的重要職責，特區政府有責任確保教師的專業操守。實施包括國家安全教育在內的國民教育，是世界各地教育當局正當合理的責任，不同地方對實施國家安全教育及培養學生國民身分，包括對各自的憲法、自身歷史、文化、地理等知識，均十分重視。」

「學術自由是香港一直推崇的重要社會價值，亦是香港高等教育界賴以成功的基石。自《香港國安法》實施以來，本港學者和專上院校繼續與境外和校外合作夥伴進行正常交流活動。同時，本地專上院校已採取一系列措施，將國家安全教育納入學生的學習範圍，以履行其法定責任。各院校在課程設計上享有自主，特區政府鼓勵其就國家安全教育為學生提供多元化的學習機會。」

保持長期繁榮穩定

​特區政府發言人強調：「自香港回歸祖國以來，特區政府按照《憲法》和《基本法》，全面準確、堅定不移貫徹落實『一國兩制』、『港人治港』、高度自治的方針，保持香港長期繁榮穩定，並已踏上由治及興的新階段。

「在『一國兩制』下，香港擁有『背靠祖國、聯通世界』此得天獨厚的顯著優勢。香港是世界貿易組織及亞太區經濟合作組織的單獨成員。香港會憑藉連接內地與世界各地的獨特優勢，繼續充分發揮其作為『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的角色。實施《香港國安法》為香港帶來的穩定環境有利於香港與世界各地達致強勁且持續的貿易增長，包括歐盟繼續是香港最大的貿易夥伴之一。此外，根據菲沙研究所發布的《世界經濟自由度 2024年度報告》，香港是全球最自由經濟體，在「國際貿易自由」及「監管」均位列首位。在《2025年世界競爭力年報》中，香港整體排名較去年上升兩位，晉身全球首三位最具競爭力的經濟體，在「商業法規」和「税務政策」更是排名全球第一。香港會繼續發揮其優勢以鞏固國際金融、航運和貿易中心等地位，以及積極融入國家發展大局包括參與粵港澳大灣區建設、『一帶一路』高質量發展等。特區政府亦會繼續全力增強發展動能，及更積極進取地招商引才，以提升香港競爭力。」

​​發言人重申：「任何外國或外部勢力詆毀香港，試圖破壞香港繁榮穩定，只會自暴其短，理屈詞窮，絕不會得逞。特區政府定當繼續堅定履職，堅持法治原則，致力確保『一國兩制』、『港人治港』、高度自治的方針實踐行穩致遠，更好結合『有為政府』和『高效市場』，更積極進取地招商引才，提升香港競爭力，推動香港經濟走上更高台階，為市民謀幸福，為香港謀發展。」"
HKSAR Government strongly disapproves of and rejects annual report of European Commission,2025-09-09 23:13,2025-09-09 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900890.htm,"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (September 9) strongly disapproved of and rejected the unfounded and biased content targeting the HKSAR's safeguarding of national security, human rights, etc, in the so-called annual report on Hong Kong issued by the European Commission and the High Representative of the European Union(EU)for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government stressed, ""The HKSAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China. It is a local administrative region that enjoys a high degree of autonomy under 'one country, two systems' and comes directly under the Central People's Government. The legal basis for implementing 'one country, two systems' comprises the Constitution and the Basic Law, which provide constitutional guarantee for fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to equality before the law, and is buttressed by the rule of law and independent judicial power.

""The HKSAR Government will resolutely, fully and faithfully implement the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) so as to address, combat, deter and prevent in accordance with the law acts and activities endangering national security. At the same time, it will safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people in accordance with the law. Its overarching goal is to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of 'one country, two systems'. The HKSAR Government strongly urges the EU to respect facts, abide by the international law and basic norms governing international relations that it claims to uphold, and immediately stop its long-arm jurisdiction and interference in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs.""

Safeguarding Due Administration of Justice and Rule of Law

The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""The HKSAR Government safeguards independent judicial power and fully supports the Judiciary in exercising its judicial power independently, safeguarding the due administration of justice and the rule of law. Establishing the mechanism for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR will not undermine the independent judicial power. Our judicial system continues to be protected by the Basic Law. When adjudicating cases concerning offence endangering national security, as in any other cases, judges remain independent and impartial in performing their judicial duties, free from any interference. The implementation of the HKNSL over the past five years has proven that the courts have handled all the cases involving the HKNSL strictly in accordance with the above principles.

""As a matter of fact, the principle of judicial deference to the executive's assessment on national security is well established in common law jurisdictions. The Court of Appeal in an important judgment decided in May 2024 that there are at least three areas where the court would make judgment while giving the executive deference on assessment on national security: first, where a fundamental right of the person affected by the measure is engaged; second, where the requirement of a fair trial is in issue; and third, where the question of open justice is raised.

The spokesman stressed, ""The rule of law in Hong Kong is strong and robust, and withstands the test of time. There is no truth in saying that there is any decline in the rule of law in Hong Kong, or that Hong Kong is becoming a 'totalitarian' city. Hong Kong's common law system has been built and maintained over the years by the joint efforts of the Judiciary and legal professions, including judges at all levels of courts, and it will not be changed because of the departure of individual overseas non-permanent judges. Despite some departures, two overseas non-permanent judges were appointed last year and this year.

""The Judiciary exercises judicial power independently in accordance with the law, and everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to a fair hearing. The courts decide cases strictly in accordance with the evidence and all applicable laws. Cases will never be handled any differently owing to the profession, political beliefs or background of the persons involved. The prosecution has the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission of an offence before a defendant may be convicted by the court.""

Safeguarding Rights and Freedoms

The HKSAR Government spokesman said, ""The HKSAR Government steadfastly safeguards the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people as protected under the law. Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, human rights in the city have always been robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. At the same time, HKSAR's laws to safeguard national security attach special importance to human rights. Article 4 of the HKNSL and the section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and that the rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, shall be protected in accordance with the law. Nonetheless, just as the case with other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. The ICCPR also expressly states that some of them may be subject to restrictions as prescribed by law that are necessary for the protection of national security, public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms of others, etc.

""Since the implementation of the HKNSL and the SNSO, the media landscape in Hong Kong has remained vibrant. However, some people with ulterior motives deliberately fabricated facts about freedom of the press and speech in Hong Kong. Like all other places in the world, freedom of the press and speech are not absolute. The media, like everyone else, has an obligation to abide by all the laws. The media continue to enjoy the freedom to comment on and criticise government policies without any restriction, as long as this is not in violation of the law. The court further cited precedents from the European Court of Human Rights regarding press freedom in the reasons for verdict of a relevant case, pointing out that the European Convention on Human Rights does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of speech even with respect to press coverage on matters of serious public concern. The most crucial point is that journalists must act in good faith and on accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism' in order to enjoy the protection of their rights to freedom of speech and press freedom.""

Laws safeguarding national security

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""In accordance with international law and international relations based on the Charter of the United Nations, it is each and every sovereign state's inherent right to enact laws safeguarding national security, and it is also an international practice. The EU exposed their double standards as they pointed fingers at Hong Kong's legal system and enforcement mechanisms to safeguard national security, while totally disregarding the constitutional duty and practical needs of the city to legislate, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the national security legislation on economic development and the protection of human rights.

""In 2020, the Central Authorities decisively enacted the HKNSL and the HKSAR Government soon afterwards promulgated it for implementation. The HKNSL has addressed the shortcomings and plugged the loopholes in the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security of the HKSAR. Its effect in stopping violence and curbing disorder was immediate, and has restored the rights and freedoms that Hong Kong citizens were unable to enjoy during the period of 'black-clad violence'. The implementation of HKNSL was a 'watershed moment' in Hong Kong's transition from chaos to order, as stability and safety of the city have been restored by the law. In 2024, the HKSAR fulfilled its constitutional duty by enacting the SNSO, thereby improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security. As a matter of fact, during the public consultation of the Basic Law Article 23 legislation, 98.6 per cent of the submissions of opinions showed support and gave positive comments, reflecting a strong consensus in society for the legislation, and it is also the aspiration of the people.

""Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law and has always adhered to the principle that 'laws must be obeyed and lawbreakers be held accountable'. Article 5 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security. The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, which have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation.

""As the legal proceedings concerning cases involving Lai Chee-ying, '35+' conspiracy to commit subversion and the Hong Kong Alliance are still ongoing, it is inappropriate for any person to comment on the details of the cases. The HKSAR Government must emphasise that all cases are handled strictly on the basis of evidence and in accordance with the law. The Department of Justice takes charge of criminal prosecutions, free from any interference by virtue of Article 63 of the Basic Law. All prosecutorial decisions are based on an objective analysis of all admissible evidence and applicable laws. All cases concerning offence endangering national security will be handled by the prosecution and judicial authorities of the HKSAR in a fair and timely manner in strict compliance with Article 42(1) of the HKNSL, with the procedural rights of defendants exercised in accordance with the law fully respected throughout the process. The situation of so-called 'delays in trials' does not exist at all.

""Extraterritorial effect for the offences under HKNSL and SNSO fully aligns with the principles of international law, international practice and common practice adopted in various countries and regions. It is both necessary and legitimate, and is also in line with those of other countries and regions around the world. It can be seen that the national security laws of various countries, including the member states of the EU, also have extraterritorial effect under the 'personality principle' and the 'protective principle'.

""As the law enforcement department of the HKSAR safeguarding national security, the Police are duty bound to pursue the liability of those who have allegedly endangered national security overseas. Those absconders are hiding overseas are wanted because they continue to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security, including inciting secession and requesting foreign countries to impose 'sanctions' or blockade and engage in other hostile activities against the People's Republic of China and the HKSAR. More so, they continue to collude with external forces to be covered for their evil deeds. Their malicious acts to endanger national security have been seen through by all, and there is no doubt that they have clearly and seriously endangered national security. As the law enforcement department of the HKSAR safeguarding national security, the Police are duty bound to put the persons concerned on the wanted list in accordance with the law and it is necessary to take all lawful measures, including the measures specified under section 89 of the SNSO, to strongly combat the acts of abscondment. The action is fully justified, necessary and legitimate. The extraterritorial effect for the laws safeguarding national security fully aligns with the principles of international law, international practice and common practice adopted in various countries and regions. Quite a number of countries would also impose similar measures on wanted criminals, including cancellation of passports.

""The Correctional Services Department (CSD) attaches great importance to the safety and health of persons-in-custody (PICs). Regardless of the identities, ages and nationalities of PICs, the CSD is committed to ensuring that the custodial environment is secure, safe, humane, appropriate and healthy, and that an environment with good ventilation, as well as appropriate and timely medical support will be provided. In the interests of a particular prisoner or for the maintenance of good order and discipline, the Commissioner of Correctional Services is empowered to make arrangements under rule 68B of the Prison Rules that such prisoner should not associate with other prisoners (i.e. the so-called 'solitary confinement'). One of the purposes of the relevant arrangement is to ensure the personal safety and well-being of the PICs, which can be requested by the PICs themselves and approved by the Commissioner after considering the matter in accordance with the law; or the Commissioner may make such arrangements after considering the relevant factors in accordance with the legal requirements and procedures. The CSD has also put in place an established mechanism, including regular independent visitors, namely Justices of the Peace, who inspect the prisons to ensure the rights of PICs are protected.

""As regards the sedition offence, the courts of the HKSAR have ruled in different cases that the provisions relating to sedition are consistent with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights on the protection of human rights, and that a proportionate and reasonable balance has been struck between safeguarding national security and protection of the freedom of speech. The offence does not in any way seek to silence expressions of what are merely genuine criticisms against the Government based on objective facts. In fact, the court's reasons for verdict in a recent Court of Appeal case has pointed out that criticising the Government, the administration of justice including court judgments, or engaging in debates about or raising objections to Government policies or decisions, however strong, vigorous or critical they may be, does not constitute a seditious intention. This provides further clarity in differentiating between lawful and unlawful speech.

""As regards the interim injunction relating to a song granted by the Court of Appeal, the HKSAR Government reiterates that the interim injunction covers four types of specified criminal acts in relation to the concerned song. The injunction pursues the legitimate aim of safeguarding national security and is necessary, reasonable, legitimate, proportionate and consistent with the requirements of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. Internationally, many jurisdictions also have legal mechanisms in place to prohibit the dissemination of information that is illegal, offensive, incites violence, incites hatred or harms the public interest. For example, the EU's Digital Services Act stipulates that upon the receipt of an order to act against a specific item(s) of illegal content, providers of intermediary services shall inform the authority of any effect given to the order without undue delay; it also requires providers of hosting services to put mechanisms in place to combat illegal contents and respond to notices received in a timely manner, including removing and disabling access to the relevant content. The unreasonable criticisms made by the EU against the legitimate legal actions taken by the HKSAR Government shows clearly the double standards held.

""As for prisoners sentenced to imprisonment by the court in accordance with the law, they would not have a right to remission. Non-referral of a prisoner having committed offence endangering national security case to the Post-release Supervision Board is a preventive measure and serves as an adjunct to the rehabilitation of the prisoner. The non-referral does not of itself increase the sentence and should not be regarded as punishment. The court also agreed that the Commissioner of Correctional Services, in performing a function conferred by the Prisons Ordinance and the Post-release Supervision of Prisoners Ordinance, has a duty to safeguard national security and must regard national security as the most important factor and give appropriate consideration to it accordingly. The Correctional Services Department has been handling relevant cases in accordance with the law and established mechanisms. In deciding whether the early release of individual prisoners would be contrary to the interests of national security, the Commissioner will carry out his relevant duties in strict accordance with the laws and deal with every case fairly and impartially.

""The attempts by external forces to 'use Hong Kong to contain China' are doomed to fail, leaving them with no option but to smear the HKNSL, SNSO and other related laws. However, the facts are clear for all to see, and both Hong Kong citizens and international investors have a discerning eye. Over five years of its implementation, the HKNSL has restored the rights and freedoms that Hong Kong citizens were unable to enjoy during the period of 'black-clad violence', and has enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community at large to swiftly return to normal and the business environment to be restored and improved continuously. According to the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025, Hong Kong's ranking improved by two places to third globally. Also, Hong Kong continues to rank among the top three international financial centres and comes fourth in initial public offering in the world. These internationally recognised achievements are built upon the freedom and stability brought to Hong Kong society by the HKNSL, other relevant laws of the HKSAR, and the work of safeguarding national security. They also provide investors and businesses worldwide with ample confidence to develop their operations in Hong Kong and leverage on Hong Kong's institutional advantages under 'one country, two systems' to explore the vast mainland China market, including the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

""The EU repeatedly uses its soâcalled annual reports to smear the HKSAR, which has been faithfully, dutifully and lawfully safeguarding national security, while turning a blind eye to the fact that the relevant laws have allowed the daily lives and economic activities of the broad masses of Hong Kong residents to return to normal and have restored the business environment. This is a classic example of hypocritical ""double standards"". The EU must immediately act reasonably and sensibly, and stop smearing the laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR.

Enhancing National Education

The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""Schools are places for students to learn and grow. It is the obligation of schools to provide a safe and orderly school environment and atmosphere, and to maintain a campus free from political interference or illegal activities, for safeguarding students' well-being. National education has been an important part of the curricula for primary and secondary schools as well as kindergartens with a view to deepening our students' understanding of the country's national affairs, history and culture, the Constitution and the Basic Law, as well as national security, thereby building up students' cultural confidence to foster a sense of national identity, and cultivating them into a new generation that is able and virtuous with a sense of responsibility, visions and love for the country and the city. Teachers are also important role models for their students, playing a vital role in passing on knowledge and nurturing students' character. The HKSAR Government has the responsibility to ensure the professional conduct of teachers. Implementation of national education, including national security education, is the legitimate duty of education authorities all over the world. Different places attach great importance to implementing national security education and developing their students' sense of national identity, including knowledge of their respective constitution, their own history, culture, geography, etc.

""Academic freedom is an important social value treasured in Hong Kong and the cornerstone of our higher education sector. Since the implementation of the HKNSL, academics or post-secondary education institutions in Hong Kong continue to conduct normal exchange activities with their foreign or external counterparts. Meanwhile, post-secondary institutions in Hong Kong have taken a series of measures to incorporate national security education into students' learning in fulfilment of their statutory duty. These institutions enjoy autonomy on curriculum design, and the HKSAR Government encourages the institutions to provide students with diversified learning opportunities on national security education.""

Maintaining Long-term Prosperity and Stability 

The HKSAR Government spokesman stressed, ""Since the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, the HKSAR Government has been fully, faithfully and resolutely implementing the principles of 'one country, two systems', 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. Hong Kong has entered a new stage of advancing from stability to prosperity.

""Under 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong has the distinctive advantage of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world. Hong Kong is a member in the World Trade Organization and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation in its own right. With the unparalleled connectivity to the Mainland and the rest of the world, Hong Kong will continue to play its unique role as ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"". The stable environment benefitted from the implementation of HKNSL has served Hong Kong well to produce strong and ever-growing trade performance with the world, including that the EU continues to be one of Hong Kong's top trading partners. In addition, according to the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report released by the Fraser Institute, Hong Kong is ranked the freest economy in the world, ranking first in ""freedom to trade internationally"" and ""regulation"". Also, in the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025, Hong Kong's overall ranking has moved up by two places from the previous year to become one of the world's top three most competitive economies, and it even tops the rankings in ""business legislation"" and ""tax policy"". Hong Kong will continue to leverage its strengths to enhance its role as international financial, maritime and trade centres, among others, whilst proactively integrating into the overall development of our nation, including the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, the high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative, etc.. The HKSAR Government will also continue to create strong impetus for growth at full steam and proactively compete for enterprises and talents to strengthen the city's competitiveness.""

The spokesman reiterated, ""Any attempt by foreign countries or external forces to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability by slandering the city will only expose their own weakness and faulty arguments and be doomed to fail. The HKSAR Government will continue to discharge its duty, in adherence to the principle of the rule of law, to steadfastly ensure the successful implementation of the principles of 'one country, two systems', 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy. It will continue to create strong impetus for growth at full steam, forge a better integration of a capable government and an efficient market, and proactively compete for enterprises and talent to strengthen the city's competitiveness. It will take the city's economic development to new heights, better serving Hong Kong citizens and fostering the city's development."""

Hong Kong enters its summer influenza season with another case of severe paediatric influenza A infection reported,2025-09-09 21:26,2025-09-09 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900855.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 9) announced a case of severe paediatric influenza A infection. The CHP also reminded members of the public that the local influenza activity has further increased over the past week, indicating that Hong Konghas entered the summer influenza season. Members of the public should maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times. Schools and parents should arrange for children to participate in the seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) programmes at the start of the new school year to receive free vaccination and prevent respiratory infections.

New case of severe paediatric influenza A infection
-------------------------------------------------------------

The case involves a 15-year-old boy who developed a fever, sore throat, coughing and vomiting yesterday (September 8). He attended a private hospital and was admitted to its paediatric intensive care unit. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen was positive for influenza A (H3) virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A complicated with septic shock. He was transferred to a general ward today and is in stable condition. So far, his household contacts are asymptomatic.

The CHP investigation revealed that the boy had received the 2024/25 seasonal influenza vaccine. Five other students in his class recently developed mild influenza-like symptoms between September 5 and 6. They sought medical treatment and none of them required hospitalisation. No outbreaks have been reported in other classes at the school so far. The CHP advised the school on the necessary infection control measures to be implemented and will continue to put the school under medical surveillance.

Since last Friday (September 5), five cases of severe paediatric influenza A infection have been recorded. This marked the first occurrence of severe paediatric cases since mid-April this year. Since January this year, the CHP has recorded a cumulative total of 16 cases of severe influenza virus infections in children. Ten of them were unvaccinated in the 2024/25 season.

Influenza activity continues to rise
-----------------------------------------
 
After cautiously monitoring influenza trends over the past two weeks, the CHP determined that Hong Kong has entered the summer influenza season. Summer influenza seasons do not occur every year. During the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic (between 2010 and 2019), Hong Kong experienced a summer influenza season in five years. The summer influenza seasons usually occurred between July and August, and lasted for six to 18 weeks. The CHP anticipated that the local influenza activity would remain at a relatively high level in the near term.

According to preliminary surveillance data, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for seasonal influenza viruses during the week of August 31 to September 6 was 6.94 per cent (provisional figure), higher than the 6.16 per cent recorded during the preceding week (August 24 to 30).

Regarding outbreaks influenza-like illness (ILI) in schools and residential care homes (RCHs), the CHP recorded 26 outbreaks during the week of August 31 to September 6, affecting a total of 259 individuals, nearly doubling from the 14 outbreaks (affecting 81 individuals) reported during the previous week (August 24 to 30). With the start of the new school term, there has been a significant increase in ILI outbreaks in schools. The number of outbreaks rose from four (affecting 25 people) in the week ending August 30 to 15 (affecting 202 people) in the week ending September 6. In the first three days of this week (September 7 to 9), 24 school outbreaks (affecting 276 people) were recorded, with four cases involving 20 to 98 people. The CHP staff have inspected these schools and advised the schools on necessary infection control measures. These included recommending that students wear masks on campus, appropriately opening windows to improve ventilation in individual activity rooms and classrooms, thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting the campus, and suspending inter-class and inter-grade activities. The CHP also advised teachers and students to check their temperature daily before returning to school. If they develop symptoms or fever, they should not go to school. The CHP will continue to put these schools and RCHs under medical surveillance.

Vaccination effectively prevents severe cases of seasonal influenza and its complications
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vaccination has been scientifically proven to be one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. It also reduces the risks of in-patient admission and mortality due to seasonal influenza. The Government has all along been encouraging the public to receive vaccination as early as possible, and providing free and subsidised seasonal influenza vaccines to eligible high-risk groups through various vaccination programmes. During the previous influenza season (2024/25), approximately 2.09 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccines were administered under various SIV Programmes, setting a new historical high. Severe influenza cases among adults and children decreased significantly by 20 per cent and 60 per cent respectively, compared to the influenza seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic. It is believed to be attributable to higher vaccination rates.

The DH announced yesterday (September 8) that the 2025/26 SIV Programmes would commence on September 25 to provide a free or subsidised SIV to eligible high-risk groups through various vaccination programmes. A number of new initiatives have been introduced to encourage and enable public participation, including further enhancing the SIV School Outreach Programme so that all schools may choose to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV nasal vaccines) and ""hybrid mode"", i.e. schools being allowed to choose both injectable inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) and LAIV for the same or different outreach vaccination activities. Approximately 2 300 schools (99 per cent) have joined the outreach programme. To safeguard students' health, the CHP will publish a list of schools not participating in the programme on its official website to remind parents to promptly arrange for children in those schools to receive vaccinations from family doctors.

To make vaccinations more accessible, the Government will open all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged 6 months to under 2 years. Moreover, the 25 District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission, and 74 general outpatient clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For a list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP's Vaccination Schemes page. Starting from 9am on September 22, parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccinations at designated MCHCs via the online booking system.

The CHP reminded high-risk persons to wear surgical masks when visiting public places. The general public should also wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly, and consider whether to go to work or school. For the latest information on seasonal influenza, members of the public can visit the CHP's seasonal influenza and COVID-19 & Flu Express webpages.

香港已進入夏季流感季節　再添一宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案,2025-09-09 20:15,2025-09-09 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900814.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月九日）公布一宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案。此外，中心提醒市民本地季節性流感的活躍程度過去一星期進一步上升，顯示香港已進入夏季流感季節。市民應時刻保持良好個人和環境衞生，學校和家長應在新學年盡早安排學童參與季節性流感疫苗接種計劃，免費接種流感疫苗，以預防感染呼吸道疾病。

最新兒童甲型流感嚴重個案
————————————

個案涉及一名15歲男童，他昨日（九月八日）開始出現發燒、喉嚨痛、咳嗽及嘔吐，到私家醫院求診，獲安排在該院的兒童深切治療部留醫。他的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感（H3）病毒呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發敗血性休克。他今日已轉往普通病房留醫，情況穩定。他的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵。

中心調查發現，男童曾接種二○二四／二五季度流感疫苗，他就讀的班別近日有另外五名學生在九月五日至六日期間出現輕微流感病徵，他們已求醫，全部無需入院。其他班別暫時未有出現爆發情況。中心已向校方建議需實施的感染控制措施，並會繼續對該校進行醫學監察。

自上周五（九月五日）起已錄得五宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案，是自今年四月中後再次錄得兒童嚴重個案。自今年一月起，中心累計接獲16宗兒童感染流感病毒的嚴重個案，當中10宗未有接種二○二四／二五季度的疫苗。

流感活躍程度持續上升
——————————

經審慎監察近兩周流感的趨勢後，中心判斷本地已進入夏季流感季節。夏季流感季節並非每年也出現，新冠疫情前的十年（二○一○年至二○一九年）期間，本地共有五年曾出現夏季流感季節，一般在七月至八月間出現，維持介乎六至18星期。中心預料本地流感活躍程度會在短期內維持在較高水平。

根據初步監測數據，在八月三十一日至九月六日的一周，呼吸道樣本中流感病毒檢測呈陽性的百分比為6.94（臨時數字），高於上一周（八月二十四日至三十日）的百分比為6.16。

學校或院舍的流感樣疾病爆發方面，中心在八月三十一日至九月六日的一周錄得 26 宗涉及學校或院舍的流感樣疾病爆發（共影響259人），比上一周（八月二十四日至三十日）的14宗（共影響81人）增加近一倍。隨着新學期開始，學校出現的流感樣疾病爆發個案顯著增加，由截至八月三十日的一周四宗爆發個案（共影響25人），上升至截至九月六日的一周15宗爆發個案（共影響202人）。本周首三天（九月七日至九日）已錄得24宗學校爆發個案（共影響276人），當中四宗個案涉及20至98人。中心已派員在該些學校視察，並向校方建議需實施的感染控制措施，包括建議學生在校內佩戴口罩、適當開啓窗戶以改善個別活動室及班房的通風情況、徹底清潔消毒校園，及停止進行跨班別和跨級別活動。中心亦建議師生每天返校前檢查體溫，如出現病徵或發燒，不應上學。中心會繼續對出現爆發個案的學校及院舍進行醫學監察。

疫苗有效預防季節性流感重症及其併發症
——————————————————

根據科學實證，接種疫苗是預防季節性流感重症及其併發症的最有效方法之一，亦可減低感染流感而導致入院留醫的機會和死亡的風險。政府一直鼓勵市民盡早接種流感疫苗，並透過各項疫苗注射計劃為合資格的高風險群組提供免費及資助季節性流感疫苗。上一年度（二○二四／二五年）衞生署的各項疫苗接種計劃共接種約209萬劑季節性流感疫苗，創下歷史新高。成人和兒童嚴重流感個案較新冠疫情前的流感季節分別顯著下跌兩成和六成，相信是歸功於疫苗接種率上升。

衞生署昨日（九月八日）公布二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃將於九月二十五日展開，為合資格的高風險群組透過各項疫苗注射計劃免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗。當中包括多項新措施鼓勵和便利市民接種，包括進一步優化季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃，讓所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗以及「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。目前已有約2 300間學校（99%）參與外展計劃。中心稍後會將不參與計劃的學校名單上載至中心網頁，以提醒有關學校的家長盡快自行安排子女到家庭醫生接種疫苗，守護學童健康。

為了讓市民更加方便接種疫苗，政府會繼續開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有6個月至2歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下的25個地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的74間普通科門診和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱衞生防護中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可由九月二十二日上午九時起透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。

中心提醒高危人士到公眾地方時，應佩戴外科口罩。市民乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，亦應考慮佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，並考慮應否上班或上學。有關最新的流感資訊，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"
"LegCo Secretariat releases Policy Pulse on ""Expanding global economic and trade network""",2025-09-09 20:08,2025-09-09 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900787.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Legislative Council Secretariat:

  The 10th Belt and Road Summit, jointly organised by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, will be held in Hong Kong tomorrow and Thursday (September 10 and 11). The Summit brings together senior government officials and business leaders from various countries to explore business opportunities, serving as a key platform for deepening Hong Kong's economic and trade ties with countries and regions along the Belt and Road (B&R). As the Summit approaches, the Legislative Council (LegCo) Secretariat today (September 9) released the latest issue of the Policy Pulse on ""Expanding global economic and trade network"".

  The Policy Pulse provides an overview ofHong Kong's latest developmentsas an international trade centre under the support of the National 14th Five-Year Plan. It highlights Hong Kong's unique advantages in economic and trade, demonstrating how the city leverages its roles as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"" to continuously expand the economic and trade network, while also summarising relevant discussions in LegCo.

  The Policy Pulse points out that, with its four ""success factors"", namely free trade policies, world-class infrastructure, the common law system and sound rule of law, as well as the institutional strengths of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong becomes one of the world's most competitive trading hubs. The SAR Government has also been adopting a multipronged approach to expand Hong Kong's global economic and trade network.

  The publication highlights Hong Kong's active expansion of trade and investment agreements network, having signed Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with 21 economies and Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (IPPAs) with 33 economies, with negotiations on an IPPA with Qatar largely concluded. LegCo Members urge the Government to strive to forge FTAs and IPPAs with more economies, with particular focus on emerging markets in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Middle East, while supporting Hong Kong enterprises in market expansion to Latin America.

  The Policy Pulse also introduces the SAR Government's proactive efforts to join the world's largest FTA – the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) – with the goal ofreducing international trade costs and barriers. It points out that Hong Kong's accessionto RCEP will help deepen trade ties among RCEP members, assisting them in participating in the B&R Initiative and facilitating their access to the Mainland market. LegCo has been actively rallying support from various parties for Hong Kong's early accession to RCEP. For instance, the President of LegCo led duty visits to three ASEAN countries (Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore) and Japan respectively, and met with Consuls-General in Hong Kong and parliamentarians from various countries to explain how Hong Kong's accession to RCEP would be conducive to achieving mutual benefits and win-win outcomes. Members also suggest that the Government should focus on promoting related supporting industries that can benefit from RCEP when planning the Northern Metropolis.

  Furthermore,the Policy Pulse details multiple initiatives by the SAR Government to attract enterprises and investment, including the development of a multinational supply chain management centre, attracting Mainland enterprises to set up international or regional headquarters in Hong Kong to manage offshore trade and supply chains, and supporting Mainland enterprises in ""going global"". Through the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), Hong Kong's access to the Mainland's goods and services markets has further opened up, enhancing the attractiveness of Hong Kong to overseas investors, and positioning Hong Kong as a perfect springboard for Mainland enterprises to ""go global"". The Second Agreement Concerning Amendment to CEPA Agreement on Trade in Services signed last year further facilitates Hong Kong service suppliers in establishing and developing businesses on the Mainland.

  The Policy Pulse notes that the B&R Initiative is a far-reaching national development strategy. Leveraging Hong Kong's distinctive advantages, the city has become the prime functional platform for the B&R Initiative. The SAR Government has been proactively expanding presence in emerging markets, with recent key initiatives including the Chief Executive's visit to the Middle East to strengthen economic and trade ties, the expansion of Hong Kong's global office network particularly in emerging markets, and the enhancement of the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Salesto assist enterprises in developing non-local markets.

  The Policy Pulse summarises various recommendations made by Members for expanding Hong Kong's global economic and trade network. These include comprehensively co-ordinating and strengthening efforts in attracting enterprises and investment; reviewing and enhancing the division of responsibilities and functions among relevant government departments and public organisations to avoid duplication of resources; establishing sound industry and supply chains to assist enterprises in ""going global and attracting foreign investment""; formulating and promoting the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area standards in more different areas, with a view to assisting Hong Kong businesses in utilising the preferential measures under CEPA to tap into the Mainland market; encouraging local airlines to operate more international flights between Hong Kong and Middle East cities in order to facilitate business and tourism; and attracting enterprises and family offices from B&R countries to set up or expand their businesses in Hong Kong.

  The detailed content of ""Expanding global economic and trade network"" is available on the LegCo website. The Policy Pulse, published by the Council Business Divisions of the LegCo Secretariat, covers specific topics and offers a comprehensive overview of related policy developments and summarised discussions in LegCo."
"InvestHK hosts ""Hong Kong - The Ideal Platform for Mainland Enterprises' Global Expansion"" seminar to showcase city's unique strengths as multinational supply chain and treasury management centre (with photos)",2025-09-09 20:00,2025-09-09 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900738.htm,"  Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) today (September 9) hosted a seminar entitled ""Hong Kong - The Ideal Platform for Mainland Enterprises' Global Expansion"". The event brought together over 120 representatives from Mainland enterprises to explore leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages as a multinational supply chain management and international financial centre to support Mainland enterprises in expanding globally.

  The seminar, supported by the Belt and Road Office of the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, was attended by guests including the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan; Vice Chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) Mr Li Zhen; the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau; and the Permanent Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Ms Maggie Wong.

  Mr Chan delivered his opening remarks, ""Hong Kong is the country's southern gateway. Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, we possess the unique advantages of connectivity with the Mainland and the world, international and multicultural inclusiveness. Our institutional strengths also include the practice of common law; free port status and free trade; zero tariffs and efficient customs clearance procedures, an extensive logistics network and world-class port infrastructure; as well as robust financial markets and professional services and many more. Hong Kong not only serves as a platform supporting Mainland enterprises to go global; our dynamic financial markets also facilitate capital raising to support their overseas business development.""

  Mr Chan added, ""It has become an established trend for Mainland enterprises to go global into the Global South and Belt and Road countries, deploying their supply chains and industrial chains while exploring more diversified markets. In response to this trend, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been promoting the city's development as a multinational supply chain management hub in recent years. InvestHK, the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council of the HKSAR have established mechanisms and dedicated teams to jointly assist Mainland enterprises in setting up international and regional headquarters in Hong Kong for offshore trade and supply chain management. We provide one-stop advisory services to support your global supply chain deployment and overseas market expansion.""

  Mr Li said, ""Amid profound changes in the global landscape, Hong Kong, leveraging its unique advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, has increasingly demonstrated its role in connecting global resources and linking international markets. It has become a crucial strategic pivot for Mainland enterprises' global expansion. Mainland enterprises have achieved substantial results in Hong Kong. As of the end of June 2025, there were 121 central State-owned enterprises listed companies in Hong Kong, with a total market capitalisation of approximately RMB5.1 trillion. In 2024, the import and export volume of non-mineral goods trade between the Mainland and Hong Kong reached US$33.2 billion, fully demonstrating Hong Kong's value as a global hub for industrial and supply chain collaboration, a platform for capital financing, and a highland for innovation co-operation.""

  Mr Li continued, ""In the future, SASAC will support central enterprises in leveraging Hong Kong as a gateway to strengthen global industrial and supply chain collaboration, broaden funding channels, participate in international standard governance, attract global talent, and deepen co-operation with various sectors in Hong Kong. It is believed that under the impetus of the 'dual circulation' paradigm and the Belt and Road initiative, Hong Kong is bound to provide even stronger support for Mainland enterprises' globalisation, enabling them to achieve new breakthroughs in serving the broader national development strategy.""

  The Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK, Ms Alpha Lau, said, ""As a leading international financial and trading hub in Asia, Hong Kong has become the preferred gateway for Mainland enterprises to expand globally. The city possesses unparalleled connectivity, serving as an international logistics hub and global trading centre with a free, open, and well-regulated business environment. Furthermore, Hong Kong possesses robust financial and capital markets, efficient financing channels, a highly transparent legal environment, and talent pool - making it the ideal base for international operations and capital management. At the same time, the Northern Metropolis, as a new engine for Hong Kong's future development, will inject new economic momentum by providing additional land for innovation and technology purposes.""

  The seminar featured two thematic panel discussions, where representatives from Mainland enterprises and Hong Kong industry leaders shared their strategies and experiences in global markets.

  The first discussion, themed ""Strategic Development of Multinational Supply Chain in the Midst of Global Changes"", was moderated by the Head of Transport, Logistics and Industrials at InvestHK, Mr Benjamin Wong. The panel guests discussed how Mainland enterprises are responding to geopolitical situation, multinational supply chain restructuring, and technological transformation. They explored strategies on leveraging Hong Kong's advantages in offshore trading, supply chain digitalisation transformation, strengthening trade settlement and financing, and positioning Hong Kong as a platform for international logistics and commodities trading.

  The second discussion, themed ""Leveraging Hong Kong's Financial Strengths to Empower Mainland Enterprises' Global Operations"", was moderated by the Global Head of Financial Services, Fintech & Sustainability at InvestHK, Mr King Leung. The panel guests explored how Mainland enterprises leverage Hong Kong to establish corporate treasury centres, optimise cross-border fund pool management structures, and reduce foreign exchange and financing risks. It also delved into the adoption opportunities of fintech and Renminbi internationalisation in supporting Mainland enterprises to expand globally.

  The seminar successfully facilitated in-depth dialogue between Mainland enterprises and Hong Kong industry leaders, reinforcing Hong Kong as a premier platform for Mainland enterprises' global expansion."
投資推廣署舉辦「香港：內地企業全球化首選平台」研討會　展示香港作為跨國供應鏈及財資管理中心的獨特優勢 （附圖）,2025-09-09 20:00,2025-09-09 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900728.htm,"​投資推廣署（投資署）今日（九月九日）舉辦「香港：內地企業全球化首選平台」研討會。活動匯聚逾120位內地企業代表出席，探討香港如何憑藉其作為跨國供應鏈管理中心及國際金融中心的獨特優勢，助力內地企業發展海外業務。

研討會由商務及經濟發展局（商經局）「一帶一路」辦公室支持，出席嘉賓包括財政司司長陳茂波、國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）副主任李鎮、商經局局長丘應樺，以及商經局常任秘書長黃少珠。

陳茂波為活動致開幕辭時表示：「香港是國家的南大門，在『一國兩制』下，擁有內聯外通、國際化和多元包容的獨特優勢。我們的制度優勢還包括實施普通法；維持自由港地位和自由貿易政策；零關稅和高效的清關手續、四通八達的物流網絡和港口基建；卓越的金融市場和專業服務等。香港不但是助力內地企業出海的平台，我們蓬勃的金融市場，也能支持內地企業籌募資金發展海外業務。」

陳茂波補充：「當前內地企業『走出去』到全球南方和『一帶一路』沿線和相關國家，布局供應鏈和產業鏈、並開拓更多元化的市場，已是大勢所趨。因應這大勢，香港特別行政區（特區）政府近年積極推動香港成為服務大家的跨國供應鏈管理中心。特區政府投資署、引進重點企業辦公室和香港貿易發展局建立了機制和專門團隊，聯手助力內地企業來港建立離岸貿易和供應鏈管理的國際和區域總部，為大家提供一站式諮詢服務，協助大家部署環球供應鏈和擴展海外市場。」

李鎮表示：「當前全球格局深刻調整，香港憑藉『一國兩制』的獨特優勢，在對接全球資源、鏈接國際市場方面的作用愈發突顯，是內地企業全球化進程中不可或缺的戰略支點。中央企業在港發展成果豐碩，截至二○二五年六月底，在港控股上市公司達121家，總市值約5.1萬億人民幣，二○二四年與香港非礦貨物貿易進出口額達332億美元，充分體現了香港作為全球產供鏈協同樞紐、資金融通平台、創新合作高地的價值。」

李鎮續指：「未來，國資委將支持中央企業以香港為紐帶，強化全球產供鏈協同，拓寬資金供給渠道，參與國際標準治理，匯聚全球英才，深化與香港各界的全方位合作。相信在國家『雙循環』格局和『一帶一路』建設的推動下，香港必將為內地企業走向世界提供更強勁的助力，共同在服務國家發展大局中實現新的突破。」

投資署署長劉凱旋表示：「香港作為亞洲領先的國際金融及貿易樞紐，正迅速發展為內地企業實現全球化的首選門戶。一方面，香港擁有無與倫比的連通性，是國際物流樞紐及國際交易中心，擁有自由、開放和規範的營商環境；另一方面，香港具備強大的金融和資本市場、便捷的融資渠道、高透明度的法治環境及專業人才，成為企業部署海外營運和資金管理的最佳據點。與此同時，北部都會區作為香港未來發展的新引擎，透過提供新土地作創新科技發展用途，將為香港注入新經濟動力。」

研討會設有兩場主題討論，邀請內地企業及香港業界代表分享在全球市場中的實戰經驗與策略。

第一場主題討論以「全球變局中跨國供應鏈發展戰略」為主題，由投資署運輸及物流／工業總裁王國藩主持。討論圍繞內地企業在地緣政治、跨國供應鏈重組及科技驅動下的全球營運策略，特別是如何透過香港優勢進行離岸貿易、供應鏈數字化轉型、貿易結算與融資布局，以及利用香港作為國際物流與大宗商品交易平台的策略部署。

第二場主題討論以「香港金融優勢賦能內地企業全球化經營」為主題，由投資署金融服務及科技、可持續發展環球總裁梁瀚璟主持，探討內地企業如何透過香港設立企業財資中心、優化跨境資金池管理結構、降低匯兌及融資風險，並深入分析金融科技與人民幣國際化在企業「走出去」過程中的應用場景與機遇。

是次研討會成功促進內地企業與香港業界的深入交流，彰顯香港作為內地企業全球化平台的優勢。"
八月份白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數回落,2025-09-09 19:50,2025-09-09 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900712.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（九月九日）公布，八月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之五點三，較七月份的百分之八點一為低，反映相關政府部門持續加緊採取防蚊及滅蚊行動，令本月的整體蚊患情況較上月有所改善。此外，食環署已加強白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數的資訊發放，讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，並會繼續進行控蚊工作，進一步降低基孔肯雅熱及登革熱的傳播風險。

八月份，全部64個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數均低於百分之二十的警戒水平。八月份每月誘蚊器指數及分區誘蚊器指數高於警戒水平的監察地區數目減少，是由於各政府部門及持份者持續加緊採取防蚊及滅蚊行動，亦有機會受天氣等因素影響。八月份的總雨量為939.2毫米，較七月份的601.7毫米及六月份的237.3毫米大幅上升。整體而言，八月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之五點三，屬於二級水平（顯示監察地區內白紋伊蚊的分布情況頗為廣泛），各相關部門及持份者仍會持續進行控蚊工作。

另外，八月份白紋伊蚊密度指數為一點一，表示在發現白紋伊蚊的誘蚊器中，白紋伊蚊的平均數量為一點一隻，顯示整體監察地區內的白紋伊蚊成蚊數量並不多。

現時，食環署會定期在部門網頁公布白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數。為讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，食環署已加強資訊發放，並通過新聞公布及社交媒體盡快發放最新的誘蚊器指數。

此外，為進一步降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險，食環署將原先在分區指數達20%時啓動的強化控蚊工作，擴展至指數介乎10%至20%的區域。具體而言，食環署會在有關區域進行詳細風險評估，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，聯同各部門及持份者進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作，亦會通知附近的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

為降低基孔肯雅熱及登革熱的傳播風險，食環署繼續在全港各區加強防控蚊患措施，並在病者的住所及於感染期曾到訪的地點250米範圍內進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊蟲滋生地、於不能清除的積水處施放殺幼蟲劑，以及於成蚊棲息處如樹木茂密、陰暗隱蔽的地點和荒廢結構進行超低微量霧化處理，以殺滅成蚊。

食環署今年繼續分三期進行全港滅蚊運動，第三期滅蚊運動已於八月四日展開，至十月二十四日止。其間，食環署各分區辦事處會針對區內一些受關注的地點，例如公眾街巿、熟食中心、小販巿場、單幢式樓宇、街道和後巷、大廈的公用地方、村屋、建築地盤、空置土地及路旁工地等，進行一連串的清除積水及防治蚊患行動。為進一步加強滅蚊的成效，食環署已聯同相關部門，於五月七日展開第二期全城防蚊及滅蚊行動，除繼續第一期工作，包括清除潛在蚊子滋生地外，食環署呼籲私人物業管理公司及早維修處所，以減少蚊子滋生地，並開始定期以超低微量噴灑方式殺滅成蚊。

食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境以徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

​白紋伊蚊是傳播登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的病媒。登革熱常見於熱帶及亞熱帶地區，在多個東南亞國家，已成為風土病。世界衞生組織（世衞）於二○二四年共錄得超過1 400萬宗登革熱個案，創歷史新高。此外，根據世衞的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。今年全球多國爆發基孔肯雅熱，截至七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗個案。鄰近地區登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的活躍程度仍然高企，巿民不應鬆懈，並應繼續採取有效的防治蚊患措施。"

海關人員於八月二十九日在落馬洲支線管制站截查該名八十三歲抵港男旅客，在其攜帶的斜孭袋及購物袋內檢獲一千七百八十一支未完稅香煙，估計市值約七千元，應課稅值約五千元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2025-09-09 19:50,2025-09-09 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900801.htm,"âAn incoming male passenger was sentenced to four weeks' imprisonment and fined $1,200 at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (September 9) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs Officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted the incoming 83-year-old male passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on August 29 and seized 1 781 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $7,000 and a duty potential of about $5,000 from his sling bag and shopping bags. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
August's monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes drops,2025-09-09 19:50,2025-09-09 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900651.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (September 9) announced that the monthly gravidtrap index (MGI) for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in August was 5.3 per cent, lower than the 8.1 per cent in July. This reflects the continued efforts by relevant government departments to intensify mosquito prevention and elimination operations, resulting in the improvement of the overall mosquito infestation situation this month. In addition, the FEHD has strengthened the dissemination of information on the gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes so that more citizens can quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation. The department will continue its mosquito control work to further reduce the risk of transmission of chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF).

In August, all 64 survey areas recorded an area gravidtrap index (AGI) lower than the alert level of 20 per cent. The decreases in the MGI and the number of surveyareas with an AGI exceeding the alert level in August are attributable to the continuous and intensified mosquito prevention and elimination operations by various government departments and stakeholders, and may also have been affected by factors such as weather. The monthly rainfall was 939.2 millimetres in August, showing a significant increase from the 601.7mm in July and 237.3mm in June. Overall, the MGI for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in August was 5.3 per cent, at Level 2 (indicating the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in the survey areas was fairly extensive). Relevant departments and stakeholders will persistently intensify mosquito prevention and elimination operations.

Moreover, the monthly density index for Aedes albopictus in August was 1.1, which represented that an average of 1.1 Aedes albopictus adults were found in the Aedes-positive gravidtraps, indicating that the number of adult Aedes albopictus was not abundant in the survey areas.

The FEHD currently makes regular announcements on gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus on its webpage. To allow more citizens to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation, the FEHD has strengthened information dissemination by promptly announcing the latest gravidtrap indexes through press releases and social media.

In addition, to further reduce the risk of transmission of CF, the FEHD has extended the intensified mosquito control work, which was originally activated when the AGI reaches 20 per cent, to cover areas with the AGI falling between 10 and 20 per cent. Specifically, the FEHD will conduct detailed risk assessments in the areas concerned to identify locations with higher mosquito infestation risks, and in collaboration with relevant departments and stakeholders, conduct intensive and targeted mosquito control work. The FEHD will also notify the nearby housing estates, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures.

To reduce the risk of transmission of CF and DF, the FEHD continues to step up mosquito prevention and control measures across all districts, and to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations within a 250 metre radius of the residence of patients and the places patients had visited during the infectious period, including removing mosquito breeding grounds, applying larvicides to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and carrying out ultra-low volume fogging operations in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

The FEHD continues to conduct its three-phase Anti-mosquito Campaign this year. The third phase of the territory-wide campaign was launched on August 4 and will run until October 24. During the period, the district offices of the FEHD will target areas that have drawn particular concern, such as public markets, cooked food centres and hawker bazaars, single-block buildings, streets and back lanes, common parts of buildings, village houses, construction sites, vacant sites and road works sites, to remove accumulated water and carry out mosquito prevention and control work. To further enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control, the FEHD and relevant government departments have carried out phase two of the All-out Anti-mosquito Operations from May 7. In addition to the work of phase one, including eliminating potential mosquito breeding places, the FEHD called on property management entities to arrange for necessary repairs to their premises to minimise mosquito breeding places and commence adult mosquito control measures by means of regular ultra-low volume fogging operations.

The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

âAedes albopictus is a kind of mosquito that can transmit DF and CF. DF is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and has become endemic in many countries in Southeast Asia. In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. Additionally, according to the WHO, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks this year, and as of July, over 240 000 cases had been reported in 16 countries/regions worldwide. The DF and CF activities in neighbouring areas have remained high. Members of the public should stay vigilant and continue to carry out effective mosquito prevention and control measures."
CE meets Secretary of CPC Hainan Provincial Committee (with photo),2025-09-09 19:00,2025-09-09 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900750.htm,"The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, met the Secretary of the CPC Hainan Provincial Committee, Mr Feng Fei, at Government House today (September 9) to exchange views on deepening Hong Kong's co-operation with Hainan. Also attending the meeting were the Director of the Chief Executive's Office, Ms Carol Yip, and the Under Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Clement Woo.

Mr Lee welcomed Mr Feng and his delegation to Hong Kong to attend the 10th Belt and Road Summit. Mr Lee said that he is pleased to meet Mr Feng again since they last met during the Chief Executive's visit to Hainan in March. Noting that Hong Kong and Hainan enjoy close geographical, cultural and business ties, Mr Lee said that the two governments signed the Hainan Provincial People's Government and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSAR) Memorandum of Cooperation in March, covering five areas of in-depth collaboration, namely trade and investment, finance, safe and orderly flow of data, tourism, and talent exchanges, further strengthening co-operation between the two places.

Mr Lee said that Hainan and Hong Kong are both key links under the Belt and Road Initiative. This year marks the customs closure operation and further opening of the Hainan Free Trade Port, actively achieving a high level of opening up and high-quality development. Hong Kong and Hainan can fully leverage their collaborative potential, jointly serving as a functional platform and contributing to the Belt and Road Initiative.

Highlighting that the Hainan Provincial People's Government is the first provincial government of the Mainland to utilise Hong Kong's financing platform and professional services to issue bonds, Mr Lee welcomed and thanked the Hainan Provincial People's Government for leveraging Hong Kong's advantages as an international financial centre and a platform for offshore Renminbi debt products, jointly contributing to the Belt and Road Initiative. The HKSAR Government will continue to actively play its bridging role, deepening exchanges and co-operation between Hong Kong and Hainan in various areas such as economy and trade, tourism, and talent, achieving complementarities and mutual benefits, and contributing to the country's high-quality development.

主席、各位委員：

大家好！行政長官在《2024年施政報告》宣布成立「促進銀髮經濟工作組」（工作組），由我和商務及經濟發展局局長分別擔任組長和副組長，領導統籌各政策局，循五個範疇制定發展方案。五個範疇是：促進「銀色消費」、發展「銀色產業」、推廣「銀色品質保證」、推廣「銀色財務及保障安排」及釋放「銀色生產動力」。

工作組自成立以來，與業界及持份者進行協商，審視了多項建議。在工作組及業界的共同努力下，香港在過去一年逐漸在不同領域開拓了銀色產業和服務。今年五月二十七日，工作組公布推行30項促進銀髮經濟措施。這一系列措施由多個政策局聯同不同界別多個機構共同推動，目標是拉動銀髮族的消費、發展銀色相關的產品和服務、以認證方式增加產品和服務的認受性以拓展銷售、善用和保障長者的財政資源，以及吸引長者投入勞動市場加強社會的生產力。

30項促進銀髮經濟措施的內容及最新進展已載述在文件第4至46段。因此，我不擬重複講述。工作組會繼續留意立法會、業界及組織和不同持份者的意見，以助政府和業界優化措施或探索未來路向。

我和同事樂意聽取委員的意見和回答各位的提問。多謝主席。"

A 23-year-old female passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds concealed in the snack packages in her carry-on suitcase and handbag. The woman was subsequently arrested.

After an investigation, the arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (September 10).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

保安局局長在立法會保安事務委員會會議就更生同行--懲教署為在囚人士提供的更生服務開場發言（只有中文）,2025-09-09 17:50,2025-09-09 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900708.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（九月九日）出席立法會保安事務委員會會議就更生同行—懲教署為在囚人士提供的更生服務的開場發言︰

主席：

懲教署一直致力確保羈管環境穩妥、安全、人道、合適和健康，同時為在囚人士提供適切的更生服務。懲教署一直肩負「更生同行者」的角色，全面落實各項措施，以多管齊下的方式加強更生工作，包括透過提供全方位的教育和進修機會、與時並進的技能培訓、針對性的心理輔導、行為和思想矯正、適切的更生計劃及就業支援，以及多元化的釋後監管和支援服務，強化在囚人士改過的決心、將更生計劃由圍牆內伸延至圍牆外，同時努力爭取社會各界積極參與和支持更生工作，協助在囚人士改過自新，重投社會。

接下來，我會重點介紹懲教署近年在不同方面的更生工作。

在教育方面，為協助在囚人士創造更多向上流的機會，懲教署在二○二三年十月在白沙灣懲教所和羅湖懲教所設立「立德學院」，為自願參與的成年在囚人士提供一年全日制應用教育文憑課程。

為進一步協助已經考取應用教育文憑的在囚人士獲取進階資歷，懲教署於上年九月在「立德學院」開設通識教育副學士課程，提供兩年全日制遙距課程的升學選擇。懲教署亦同時將「立德學院」擴展至壁屋監獄，為未能在餘下刑期內完成副學士學位的「立德學院」畢業生，提供半日通識教育副學士課程和半日職業訓練，讓他們能夠接受短期升學和職業訓練，協助他們繼續裝備自己，為即將獲釋重投社會做好準備。

在職業訓練方面，懲教署為青少年在囚人士提供13項市場導向的職業訓練課程，以及為將於24個月內獲釋並可合法居留受僱的成年在囚人士，開辦超過40項自願參與的職業訓練課程，提供超過1700個訓練名額。這些課程都由本地培訓機構協辦，並且獲資歷架構或市場認證，有助更生人士就業和報讀銜接或進階課程。

在就業方面，為協助在囚人士獲得更多向上流動的機會，懲教署近年推出「『招』『職』創未來」計劃，為他們提供「一條龍」培訓和工作發展機會，鼓勵他們及早規劃人生，發揮所長，並為社會作出貢獻。計劃內容包括生涯規劃、所內培訓、釋後實習、正式聘請以及師友計劃。

在行為和思想矯正方面，針對因涉及「黑暴」事件和違反《香港國安法》或《維護國家安全條例》的在囚人士的特殊更生需要，懲教署繼續在「沿途有『理』」計劃下，致力按三大更生計劃方向，分別為認識中國歷史和加強國民教育、心理和價值觀重整，以及生涯規劃和家庭關係重修，協助他們重新建立正確的價值觀，積極面對往後人生路上的各種挑戰。

在心理輔導方面，懲教署在上年於羅湖懲教所和豐力樓開展「更生輔助犬服務」，向有需要的在囚人士提供動物輔助治療，改善他們的抑鬱和焦慮情緒，並減低他們的暴力傾向。另外，亦在豐力樓推行的「更生輔助犬服務實習生計劃」，讓中途宿舍受訓生通過照顧更生輔助犬，提升自信心和培養責任感。懲教署還安排受訓生和更生輔助犬到長者服務中心進行關愛探訪服務，藉此回饋社會。

在釋後更生支援方面，懲教署近年新設四間多用途家庭及更生服務中心，進一步加強為更生人士，和他們的家人提供個人和小組輔導服務，以及便利在囚人士家屬進行視像探訪。懲教署亦於去年在屯門和上水兩間多用途家庭及更生服務中心設立家庭治療中心，為正接受法定監管的戒毒者，以及有暴力傾向或思想激進的更生人士舉辦不同類型的治療項目，將在囚期間的心理和家庭輔導服務延伸至社區，協助他們與家人重修關係。

另外，懲教署在去年成立更生服務研究組，目的是通過推動研究工作和參考國際最新的研究結果，開展實證為本的更生服務。

過去20多年，香港的再犯率跌幅非常明顯，由二○○○年的39.9%下降至二○二二年的21.8%，這個得來不易的成果，正正反映懲教署一直以來的堅持和努力、在囚和更生人士改過的決心，以及社會各界對助更新工作的支持。

展望未來，懲教署會繼續因應社會的轉變和需要，積極檢討和加強各項更生服務和計劃，以及與各界攜手，在社區內積極推動更生工作。

多謝主席。"

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月三十一日至九月六日）廣東省新增178宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較過去兩周分別225宗（八月二十四日至三十日）及336宗（八月十七日至二十三日）進一步減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然廣東省的新增病例數字過去一個月持續遞減，但現時全球多國仍爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

本港今年累計錄得13宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-09 17:30,2025-09-09 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900636.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (September 9), nonew cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 178 new CF cases in Guangdong during the past week (August 31 to September 6), showing a further decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 225 cases (August 24 to 30) and 336 cases (August 17 to 23) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the number of new CF cases in Guangdong Province has continued to decline over the past month, many countries worldwide are still experiencing CF outbreaks. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 13 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

â
âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

I expect CMHHK and the three universities to create synergy in providing better CM services for members of the public, as well as fostering training and education, and scientific research and innovation in CM. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will continue to give full support to the CMHHK in collaborating with various stakeholders to make good use of the development platform of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and fully leverage Hong Kong's unique advantage of enjoying strong support from the motherland and being closely connected to the world, with a view to contributing to the national development of CM.""

The clinical services of CMHHK cover six specialised CM services, namely Internal Medicine in CM, External Medicine in CM, Gynaecology in CM, Paediatrics in CM, Orthopaedics and Traumatology in CM and Acupuncture and Moxibustion in CM. CM experts from the three universities will participate in these services and jointly formulate clinical standards and guidelines, enabling CMHHK to provide quality and safe services for members of the public. Meanwhile, as the CM teaching hospital for the three universities, CMHHK will provide local clinical placements and advanced training opportunities for undergraduates and postgraduates, serving as an important base for nurturing CM talent. In addition, the hospital's diverse clinical cases, coupled with the top-tier research capabilities of the universities, will foster CM scientific research development, including proprietary Chinese medicines development and clinical research. CMHHK will also strengthen co-operation with counterparts on the Mainland and overseas through the international academic networks of the three universities, thereby facilitating CM's going global with concerted effort.

At the signing ceremony, Professor Lo; the President and Vice-Chancellor of HKBU, Professor Alexander Wai (representative of CMHHK); and representatives of the three universities, namely the Vice-President (Research and Development) of HKBU, Professor Lyu Aiping; the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the CUHK, Professor Philip Chiu; and the Vice-President and Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Health) and Dean of the LKS Faculty of Medicine of the HKU, Professor Lau Chak-sing, jointly witnessed the signing of agreements by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of CMHHK Operator, Mr Huen Wong, with the Dean of the School of Chinese Medicine of HKBU, Professor Li Min; the Director of the School of Chinese Medicine of the CUHK, Professor Lin Zhixiu; and the Associate Dean (Clinical Affairs) of the LKS Faculty of Medicine of HKU and Director of HKU Health System, Professor Victoria Wong, respectively. The Hospital Chief Executive of CMHHK, Professor Bian Zhaoxiang, also attended the media briefing held after the signing ceremony.

Located at 1 Pak Shing Kok Road in Tseung Kwan O, CMHHK adopts a public-private partnership model with its construction fully funded by the Government. The Government commissioned HKBU as the Contractor through tendering procedures in 2021. HKBU subsequently incorporated a company limited by guarantee in the same year in accordance with the service deed to act as the operator for managing, operating and maintaining the hospital. CMHHK will commence services in phases starting from December this year."

He witnessed CMHHK, as the Chinese medicine (CM) teaching hospital for the respective universities, establish a close partnership with the universities to promote the high-quality and high-standard development of CM in Hong Kong on all fronts.

Professor Lo said, ""Today, CMHHK becomes the CM teaching hospital for the three universities, which marks a significant milestone in the development of CM services, training and education, and scientific research in Hong Kong. I expect CMHHK and the three universities to create synergy in providing better CM services for members of the public, as well as fostering training and education, and scientific research and innovation in CM. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will continue to give full support to the CMHHK in collaborating with various stakeholders to make good use of the development platform of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and fully leverage Hong Kong's unique advantage of enjoying strong support from the motherland and being closely connected to the world, with a view to contributing to the national development of CM.""

The clinical services of CMHHK cover six specialised CM services, namely Internal Medicine in CM, External Medicine in CM, Gynaecology in CM, Paediatrics in CM, Orthopaedics and Traumatology in CM and Acupuncture and Moxibustion in CM. CM experts from the three universities will participate in these services and jointly formulate clinical standards and guidelines, enabling CMHHK to provide quality and safe services for members of the public. Meanwhile, as the CM teaching hospital for the three universities, CMHHK will provide local clinical placements and advanced training opportunities for undergraduates and postgraduates, serving as an important base for nurturing CM talent. In addition, the hospital's diverse clinical cases, coupled with the top-tier research capabilities of the universities, will foster CM scientific research development, including proprietary Chinese medicines development and clinical research. CMHHK will also strengthen co-operation with counterparts on the Mainland and overseas through the international academic networks of the three universities, thereby facilitating CM's going global with concerted effort.

At the signing ceremony, Professor Lo; the President and Vice-Chancellor of HKBU, Professor Alexander Wai (representative of CMHHK); and representatives of the three universities, namely the Vice-President (Research and Development) of HKBU, Professor Lyu Aiping; the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the CUHK, Professor Philip Chiu; and the Vice-President and Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Health) and Dean of the LKS Faculty of Medicine of the HKU, Professor Lau Chak-sing, jointly witnessed the signing of agreements by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of CMHHK Operator, Mr Wong Kwai-huen, with the Dean of the School of Chinese Medicine of HKBU, Professor Li Min; the Director of the School of Chinese Medicine of the CUHK, Professor Lin Zhixiu; and the Associate Dean (Clinical Affairs) of the LKS Faculty of Medicine of HKU and Director of HKU Health System, Professor Victoria Wong, respectively. The Hospital Chief Executive of CMHHK, Professor Bian Zhaoxiang, also attended the media briefing held after the signing ceremony.

Located at 1 Pak Shing Kok Road in Tseung Kwan O, CMHHK adopts a public-private partnership model with its construction fully funded by the Government. The Government commissioned HKBU as the Contractor through tendering procedures in 2021. HKBU subsequently incorporated a company limited by guarantee in the same year in accordance with the service deed to act as the operator for managing, operating and maintaining the hospital. CMHHK will commence services in phases starting from December this year."

Quarterly business receipts indices for service industries for second quarter of 2025,2025-09-09 16:30,2025-09-09 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900575.htm,"  Business receipts in value terms of most of the major service industries showed increases of varying magnitudes in the second quarter of 2025 when compared with the second quarter of 2024, according to the provisional figures of business receipts indices released today (September 9) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

  Comparing the second quarter of 2025 with the second quarter of 2024, double-digit increases were recorded in business receipts indices of the financing (except banking) (+27.7%), import/export trade (+21.2%), insurance (+20.7%) and banking (+14.5%) industries. On the other hand, the real estate industry recorded a decrease of 8.1% in business receipts index during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 75.6% year-on-year during the same period, while that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain also increased by 9.6% year-on-year.

  On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison, business receipts in value terms of around half of the major service industries recorded increases of varying magnitudes in the second quarter of 2025 when compared with the first quarter of 2025. In particular, business receipts indices of the financing (except banking) and real estate industries increased by 3.5% and 3.0% respectively. On the other hand, business receipts index of the insurance industry decreased by 13.9% during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, comparing the second quarter of 2025 with the first quarter of 2025 on a seasonally adjusted basis, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 10.0%, whereas that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain decreased by 5.6%.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business receipts of most service industries recorded increases in the second quarter of 2025 over a year earlier. More notable increases in business receipts were seen for the financing (except banking), import/export trade, insurance, and banking industries.

  Looking ahead, the continued economic expansion should benefit the business of various service industries. Though some industries may be more affected by external uncertainties, steady economic growth in Asia particularly the Mainland, sustained increases in local employment earnings, together with the Government's various measures to boost the economy and attract investment, would provide support to different service industries.

Further information

  Table 1 presents the business receipts indices and their corresponding year-on-year rates of change in respect of selected service industries and service domains for the recent five quarters, while Table 2 shows the corresponding quarter-to-quarter rates of change in the business receipts indices for the recent five quarters based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The revised figures of business receipts indices for the second quarter of 2025 will be released at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/web_table.html?id=660-69001) on October 17, 2025.

  Data for compiling the business receipts indices are mainly based on the Quarterly Survey of Service Industries conducted by the C&SD, supplemented by relevant data provided by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Tourism Board.

  A service domain differs from a service industry in that it comprises those economic activities which straddle different industries but are somehow related to a common theme. It may include all activities carried out by all establishments in a service industry that is closely related to the domain. For a service industry that is less closely related, however, only a portion of the establishments in the industry or even only part of the economic activities of the establishments is related to the domain. Taking the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain as an example, it includes all services of convention and exhibition organisers, short-term accommodation services and services of travel agents, and some of the services (only those involving visitors as customers) of restaurants, retailers and transport operators.

  The classification of service industries follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into relevant industry classes.

  More detailed statistics are given in the report ""Quarterly Business Receipts Indices for Service Industries, Second Quarter 2025"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080006&scode=520).

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for August 2025,2025-09-09 16:30,2025-09-09 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900391.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (September 9) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for August 2025.

  The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs increased slightly from 42.1 in July 2025 in the contractionary zone to 42.3 in August 2025, whereas the one-month's ahead (i.e. September 2025) outlook DI on business receipts was 45.7. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts, despite below the 50-mark, rose in August 2025 as compared with previous month for some surveyed sectors, including retail trade (from 39.3 to 41.1) and wholesale trade (from 40.4 to 41.3).

  The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades decreased from 45.0 in July 2025 to 44.2 in August 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month's time (i.e. September 2025) was 47.0.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business sentiment among SMEs and their outlook in one month's time both improved slightly further in August. The overall employment situation also turned better.

  Looking ahead, local business sentiment would continue to be affected by the uncertain external environment. Nonetheless, solid growth in the local economy, coupled with steady economic growth in Asia in particular the Mainland, should provide support. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.

Further information

  The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to establishments with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent establishments in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

  The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own establishments rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300).

二零二五年八月份中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查結果,2025-09-09 16:30,2025-09-09 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900385.htm,"政府統計處今日（九月九日）發表二零二五年八月份中小型企業（中小企）業務狀況按月統計調查的結果。

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年七月在收縮區域的42.1輕微上升至二零二五年八月的42.3，而未來一個月（即二零二五年九月）的業務收益展望動向指數為45.7。按行業分析，業務收益現時動向指數雖低於50的分界線，但一些統計調查涵蓋的行業的相關指數在二零二五年八月較上月上升，包括零售業（從39.3上升至41.1）及批發業（從40.4上升至41.3）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數從二零二五年七月的45.0下跌至二零二五年八月的44.2，而未來一個月（即二零二五年九月）的新訂單展望動向指數為47.0。

評論

政府發言人表示，八月中小企的營商氣氛和對未來一個月的預期均進一步略為改善。整體就業情況亦見好轉。

展望未來，外圍環境不明朗，將繼續影響本地營商氣氛。儘管如此，本地經濟增長穩健，加上亞洲尤其是內地經濟持續穩步增長，應會提供支持。政府會繼續密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指就業人數少於50人的機構單位。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於大規模機構單位的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己機構單位情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

二零二五年第二季服務行業按季業務收益指數,2025-09-09 16:30,2025-09-09 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900414.htm,"政府統計處今日（九月九日）發表的業務收益指數的臨時數字顯示，二零二五年第二季與二零二四年第二季比較，大部分主要服務行業以價值計算的業務收益均有不同程度的升幅。

二零二五年第二季與二零二四年第二季比較，金融業（銀行除外）（+27.7%）、進出口貿易業（+21.2%）、保險業（+20.7%）及銀行業（+14.5%）的業務收益指數均錄得雙位數升幅。另一方面，地產業的業務收益指數同期則下跌8.1%。

按服務界別分析，電腦及資訊科技服務界別的業務收益指數同期按年上升75.6%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別的業務收益指數亦按年上升9.6%。

二零二五年第二季與二零二五年第一季比較，約一半主要服務行業經季節性調整的業務收益（以價值計算）均錄得不同程度的升幅。當中，金融業（銀行除外）及地產業的業務收益指數按季分別上升3.5%和3.0%。另一方面，保險業的業務收益指數同期則下跌13.9%。

按服務界別分析，二零二五年第二季與二零二五年第一季比較，電腦及資訊科技服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數上升10.0%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數則下跌5.6%。

評論

政府發言人表示，二零二五年第二季大部分服務行業的業務收益較去年同期上升。較顯著的升幅見於金融業（銀行除外）、進出口貿易業、保險業，以及銀行業。

展望未來，經濟持續擴張應會惠及不同服務行業的業務。儘管一些行業或會較受外圍不確定性所影響，但亞洲尤其是內地經濟穩步增長，本地就業收入持續增加，加上政府多項提振經濟和吸引投資的措施，將為不同服務行業提供支持。

進一步資料

表1載列最近五季選定服務行業及服務界別的業務收益指數及其相應按年變動百分率，而表2則載列最近五季經季節性調整的業務收益指數按季變動百分率。

二零二五年第二季的業務收益指數的修訂數字將於二零二五年十月十七日在政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/web_table.html?id=660-69001）發布。

編製業務收益指數所用的數據主要來自政府統計處進行的「服務行業按季統計調查」，並輔以香港金融管理局及香港旅遊發展局提供的有關數據。

服務界別有別於服務行業，前者包括橫跨不同行業但與某個共同主題相關的經濟活動。服務界別可能包括某個服務行業內所有機構單位進行的全部經濟活動，而該服務行業與該服務界別關係密切。然而，在一個與該服務界別關係不太密切的服務行業內，只有部分機構單位甚或只有這些機構單位的部分經濟活動是與該服務界別有關。以旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別為例，這界別包括所有會議展覽機構的服務、短期住宿服務及旅行社所提供的服務，以及食肆、零售商及運輸服務營辦商的部分服務（只包括以旅客為對象的服務）。

服務行業的分類是採用「香港標準行業分類2.0版」。該行業分類用於各類經濟統計調查，把經濟單位分類歸入合適的行業類別。

尊敬的李副主任（國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）副主任李鎮）、各位嘉賓、各位企業家朋友們：

下午好！很高興在這裏與大家齊聚一堂，共同探討內地企業如何利用香港這個獨特的平台，實現全球化的戰略布局。首先，我謹代表香港特區政府，衷心感謝國務院國資委對今天研討會的大力支持，並熱烈歡迎所有遠道而來的內地企業代表和嘉賓朋友們。

習近平主席指出，對外開放是我國的基本國策，我國正在推進高水平對外開放，開放的大門只會越開越大。香港是國家的南大門，在「一國兩制」下，擁有內聯外通、國際化和多元包容的獨特優勢。我們的制度優勢還包括實施普通法；維持自由港地位和自由貿易政策；零關稅和高效的清關手續 、四通八達的物流網絡和港口基建；卓越的金融市場和專業服務等。香港不但是助力內地企業出海的平台，我們蓬勃的金融市場，也能支持內地企業籌募資金發展海外業務。

事實上，我們的優勢獲得國際社會廣泛認同。例如，在瑞士洛桑國際管理發展學院今年發表的《世界競爭力年報》，香港連續兩年上升共四位至全球第三；今年三月的《全球金融中心指數》，香港穩居第三，在亞太稱冠；加拿大菲沙研究所去年也將香港評為全球最自由經濟體。今日剛公布的《2025年世界人才排名》，香港排名全球第四，亞洲第一。

去年，外來駐港公司數量升到9 960家，創下歷史新高，其中來自內地的駐港公司數目最多，佔超過四分之一。

金融服務方面，香港擁有全鏈條的籌融資市場，可為處於不同發展階段的企業提供金融支持。無論是天使投資、風險基金、私募基金、證券市場，還是銀行貸款，香港都能把全球資金跟企業接連起來，全方位多層次支持企業的業務拓展。

特別值得一提的是，香港也是全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，可以為內地企業提供境外人民幣融資，企業也可以把境外人民幣在此進行管理和投資。通過在香港設立財資中心，企業能夠高效地整合和調配全球資金，實現跨境資金池管理、優化流動性配置、降低匯率風險，並提高資金使用效率。香港完善的金融基建、資金自由流動的環境以及與國際接軌的監管體系，為企業海外資金管理提供了安全、便捷、高效的解決方案。

近年來，特區政府積極推動香港發展成為國際創科中心，深化政、產、學、研、投聯動合作。 我們樂見近年不少內地企業在港設立研發中心，推動產品及技術走向全球。事實上，在世界知識產權組織最新發佈的《2025年全球創新指數》中，「深圳—香港—廣州」集群首次位列全球第一，反映粵港澳大灣區的創新能力獲國際高度認可。 香港不僅是大灣區內創新科技產出和加速成長的地方，更為內地科創企業走向全球提供全面的知識產權保護。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，世界百年變局加速演進，近年全球貿易和供應鏈格局重構，為內地企業帶來了挑戰、也創造了機遇。當前內地企業「走出去」到全球南方和「一帶一路」沿線和相關國家，布局供應鏈和產業鏈、並開拓更多元化的市場，已是大勢所趨。因應這大勢，特區政府近年積極推動香港成為服務大家的跨國供應鏈管理中心。特區政府投資推廣署、引進重點企業辦公室和香港貿易發展局（貿發局）建立了機制和專門團隊，聯手助力內地企業來港建立離岸貿易和供應鏈管理的國際和區域總部，為大家提供一站式諮詢服務，協助大家部署環球供應鏈和擴展海外市場。貿發局的海外辦事處亦為內地企業提供在地支援，包括協助企業建立與海外市場的聯繫、了解海外市場法規；提供不同新興國家的市場調查；以及它們在環境、社會和企業管治（ESG）、檢測及認證、出口信用風險管理等方面的資訊。

至今，內地企業通過香港這個平台成功「走出去」的包括來自工程機械界、創意產業界、物流運輸界等。今日多家在港的內地企業代表會跟大家分享他們在香港發展的經驗。

在中央的堅實支持下，我們會竭盡所能支持內地企業出海發展。

歡迎各位積極考慮在香港設立國際業務地區總部、跨國供應鏈管理中心、財資中心、電商中心、知識產權管理中心、科研中心等，讓香港的各種優勢，成就大家的國際化發展。

最後，祝願希望今天的研討會圓滿成功，各位嘉賓朋友事業宏達，身體健康！謝謝大家！"

Sanctions imposed on District Council member for misconduct,2025-09-09 16:00,2025-09-09 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900578.htm,"  The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs (SHYA), Miss Alice Mak, informed Tuen Mun District Council (DC) member Mr Kenneth Yip Kat-kong in writing today (September 9) that, in light of his dangerous driving conviction, which constituted misconduct, his functions and duties as a DC member shall be suspended for one week.

  The SHYA appointed a supervisory committee on July 18 pursuant to section 72C of the District Councils Ordinance (Cap. 547) to investigate the alleged misconduct of Mr Yip. The supervisory committee submitted a report to the SHYA on September 1. After considering the evidence related to the misconduct, the negative impact of the incident on DC members, DCs and the Government's reputation and credibility, as well as Mr Yip's written representation, the supervisory committee concluded that Mr Yip's dangerous driving conviction constituted misconduct and recommended suspending Mr Yip's functions and duties as a DC member for one week.

  Pursuant to section 72D of the Ordinance and the Performance Monitoring Guidelines for Members of the District Councils, and after considering the report of the supervisory committee, the SHYA concurred with the supervisory committee's opinions that Mr Yip's dangerous driving conviction constituted misconduct, and decided to suspend his functions and duties as a DC member for one week. For the period of suspension, he shall not be entitled to receive any remuneration or allowances, including end-of-service gratuity, but shall be entitled to be reimbursed for the operating expenses incurred, e.g. office rentals and staff salaries, during the period.

  Miss Mak said, ""This is the first time the Government has investigated and imposed sanctions on a DC member for misconduct in accordance with the performance monitoring mechanism for DC members under the improved district governance. The Government places strong emphasis on the conduct and integrity of DC members, and they should conduct themselves in a manner that is in line with public expectations and commensurate with the reputation of the DC and its members. The Government will continue to monitor the performance of DC members to ensure that every DC member upholds their duties to serve the people. The Government would also like to express gratitude to the five members of the supervisory committee for their work and opinions on the case.""

  Mr Yip will be suspended from his functions and duties as a DC member from tomorrow (September 10) to September 16 (both dates inclusive). The DC website has been updated accordingly for public information."

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on September 8 to noon today (September 9), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 86 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit.

Ambassador Valler (Consul-General of Brazil in Hong Kong, Mr Wladimir Valler Filho), Deputy Commissioner Pan Yundong (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Consuls-General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon.

It's a pleasure to be here, today, in celebration of Brazil's National Day – the 203rd anniversary of its Declaration of Independence. On this special occasion, we honour not only the rich history and culture of Brazil but also the enduring friendship between our peoples.

Brazil is a country of enviable superlatives. The world's fifth-largest nation in area, it's also the seventh-largest in population, with some 213 million people.

As Latin America's largest economy, Brazil has built an impressive and diversified industrial base, with globally competitive companies spanning agriculture, manufacturing, aerospace, metallurgy, services, and more.

I'm pleased to say that Brazil is also our key trading partner in Latin America. Last year, Brazil was Hong Kong's largest import source and second-largest export market in the region. Bilateral merchandise trade between our economies last year reached US$3.4 billion - an increase of more than 18 per cent year on year. These figures speak to the strength and potential of our economic ties.

At a time when protectionism and unilateralism are on the rise globally, Brazil continues to champion multilateralism and international co-operation. It has been a steadfast partner to our country, China, in building a multipolar world and a more sustainable planet. These shared values are more important than ever, as we work together to build a more inclusive and resilient global community. 

Last year marked the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, when President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Brazil. It was a milestone celebrated with the signing of over 30 bilateral agreements. And during President Lula da Silva's state visit to our country in May this year, a further 20 co-operation agreements were concluded, covering a wide range of areas including science and technology, digital economy, finance, and more.

This deepening of co-operation between Brazil and China opens up new and exciting avenues for Hong Kong to strengthen its engagement with Brazil. Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong serves as a vital bridge between China and the rest of the world. We are well positioned to facilitate and expand bilateral ties across business, trade and innovation.

Hong Kong offers a world-class business environment, underpinned by the rule of law, a free and open economy, and a regulatory regime that is aligned with the best international standards and enriched by a vibrant international and diverse community. These core strengths continue to earn us high recognition in global competitiveness rankings and positive feedback from international businesses operating here.

In trade, our zero-tariff regime, efficient logistics, and seamless customs clearance make Hong Kong an ideal gateway for Brazilian goods entering the Greater Bay Area and the broader Chinese and Asian markets. 

One area of particular promise for future collaboration is innovation and technology. Brazil leads Latin America in the number and diversity of its start-ups, reflecting a dynamic and entrepreneurial spirit. Likewise, Hong Kong is emerging as a leading I&T hub, bolstered by the strength of the Greater Bay Area, which hosted an innovation cluster that tops the world in a recent ranking by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

We are actively attracting global talent, companies and start-ups to join our thriving innovation ecosystem, with nearly 30 per cent of start-up founders coming from outside Hong Kong.

It helps that Hong Kong is Asia's leading financial centre, offering a full range of funding options, with deep liquidity, exceptional professional services, and unparalleled international connectivity. For start-ups and innovators, launching here is effectively an international seal of approval. If a start-up can thrive in Hong Kong, it is likely to succeed elsewhere.

Of course, our growing ties are not limited to business alone. We welcome Brazilian music, dance, food and drink, entertainment and, yes, football, too. I had the pleasure of enjoying a taste of Brazilian culture in June, at the opening ceremony of ""Extravaganza! When Brazil Meets Hong Kong"", down by the harbour. It was a joyful and colourful celebration that added vibrancy to Hong Kong's calendar as Asia's events capital.

I am delighted to hear that Brazil's ""Extravaganza"" will return to Hong Kong next year, and I look forward to even more cultural exchanges that bring our communities closer together.

Ambassador Valler (Consul-General of Brazil in Hong Kong, Mr Wladimir Valler Filho), Deputy Commissioner Pan Yundong (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Consuls-General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon.

It's a pleasure to be here, today, in celebration of Brazil's National Day – the 203rd anniversary of its Declaration of Independence. On this special occasion, we honour not only the rich history and culture of Brazil but also the enduring friendship between our peoples.

Brazil is a country of enviable superlatives. The world's fifth-largest nation in area, it's also the seventh-largest in population, with some 213 million people.

As Latin America's largest economy, Brazil has built an impressive and diversified industrial base, with globally competitive companies spanning agriculture, manufacturing, aerospace, metallurgy, services, and more.

I'm pleased to say that Brazil is also our key trading partner in Latin America. Last year, Brazil was Hong Kong's largest import source and second-largest export market in the region. Bilateral merchandise trade between our economies last year reached US$3.4 billion - an increase of more than 18 per cent year on year. These figures speak to the strength and potential of our economic ties.

At a time when protectionism and unilateralism are on the rise globally, Brazil continues to champion multilateralism and international co-operation. It has been a steadfast partner to our country, China, in building a multipolar world and a more sustainable planet. These shared values are more important than ever, as we work together to build a more inclusive and resilient global community. 

Last year marked the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, when President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Brazil. It was a milestone celebrated with the signing of over 30 bilateral agreements. And during President Lula da Silva's state visit to our country in May this year, a further 20 co-operation agreements were concluded, covering a wide range of areas including science and technology, digital economy, finance, and more.

This deepening of co-operation between Brazil and China opens up new and exciting avenues for Hong Kong to strengthen its engagement with Brazil. Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong serves as a vital bridge between China and the rest of the world. We are well positioned to facilitate and expand bilateral ties across business, trade and innovation.

Hong Kong offers a world-class business environment, underpinned by the rule of law, a free and open economy, and a regulatory regime that is aligned with the best international standards and enriched by a vibrant international and diverse community. These core strengths continue to earn us high recognition in global competitiveness rankings and positive feedback from international businesses operating here.

In trade, our zero-tariff regime, efficient logistics, and seamless customs clearance make Hong Kong an ideal gateway for Brazilian goods entering the Greater Bay Area and the broader Chinese and Asian markets. 

One area of particular promise for future collaboration is innovation and technology. Brazil leads Latin America in the number and diversity of its start-ups, reflecting a dynamic and entrepreneurial spirit. Likewise, Hong Kong is emerging as a leading I&T hub, bolstered by the strength of the Greater Bay Area, which hosted an innovation cluster that tops the world in a recent ranking by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

We are actively attracting global talent, companies and start-ups to join our thriving innovation ecosystem, with nearly 30 per cent of start-up founders coming from outside Hong Kong.

It helps that Hong Kong is Asia's leading financial centre, offering a full range of funding options, with deep liquidity, exceptional professional services, and unparalleled international connectivity. For start-ups and innovators, launching here is effectively an international seal of approval. If a start-up can thrive in Hong Kong, it is likely to succeed elsewhere.

Of course, our growing ties are not limited to business alone. We welcome Brazilian music, dance, food and drink, entertainment and, yes, football, too. I had the pleasure of enjoying a taste of Brazilian culture in June, at the opening ceremony of ""Extravaganza! When Brazil Meets Hong Kong"", down by the harbour. It was a joyful and colourful celebration that added vibrancy to Hong Kong's calendar as Asia's events capital.

I am delighted to hear that Brazil's ""Extravaganza"" will return to Hong Kong next year, and I look forward to even more cultural exchanges that bring our communities closer together.

On this note, I wish you a happy national day. Thank you very much."

EDB announces Study Subsidy Scheme for Designated Professions/Sectors for 2026/27 cohort - undergraduate programmes,2025-09-09 14:30,2025-09-09 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900348.htm,"âThe Education Bureau (EDB) announced today (September 9) that the Study Subsidy Scheme for Designated Professions/Sectors (SSSDP) will subsidise a total of 4 781 places in 57 undergraduate programmes, covering 3 425 places in 57 first-year-first-degree (FYFD) programmes and 1 356 places in 45 top-up degree (TUD) programmes of eight post-secondary institutions for the cohort to be admitted in the 2026/27 academic year.

The programmes of the SSSDP fall under 10 disciplines that have been identified as having keen manpower demand, namely architecture and engineering, computer science, creative industries, financial technology, healthcare, insurance, logistics, sports and recreation, testing and certification, and tourism and hospitality. The programmes include 16 applied degree programmes, which will receive additional subsidies, with a view to further strengthening the vocational and professional education and training progression pathway at the post-secondary level.

The programmes and numbers of subsidised places under the SSSDP are determined by the EDB in consultation with relevant policy bureaux and departments. Details of the participating institutions, the programmes and the numbers of subsidised places are listed in the Annex. The EDB will continue to work with relevant policy bureaux and departments to explore covering more suitable programmes in the SSSDP.

The annual subsidy amounts for the 2026/27 academic year will remain unchanged at $81,450 for laboratory-based programmes and $46,780 for non-laboratory-based programmes. For applied degree programmes, including the additional annual subsidies, the total annual subsidy amounts will also remain unchanged at $89,620 for laboratory-based programmes and $51,880 for non-laboratory-based programmes.

The subsidy amounts are applicable to both new and continuing eligible students. The subsidy is tenable for the normal duration of the programmes concerned. Subsidised students will pay a tuition fee with the subsidy applied. Students in need may still apply for student financial assistance from the Student Finance Office of the Working Family and Student Financial Assistance Agency in respect of the actual amount of tuition fee payable.

The subsidised FYFD intake places are allocated mainly through the Joint University Programmes Admissions System to ensure that eligible students are selected on a merit basis, whereas the subsidised places of the TUD programmes are allocated in accordance with the existing admission arrangements of the self-financing TUD programmes, i.e. through direct admission by institutions. Students can apply for admission to the programmes directly through the institutions concerned.

The SSSDP was launched in the 2015/16 academic year to subsidise students to pursue designated full-time locally accredited self-financing undergraduate programmes in selected disciplines. The objectives are as follows:

(1) to increase the supply of subsidised undergraduate places by leveraging the supply of the self-financing post-secondary education sector;

(2) to nurture talent in support of specific industries with keen demand for human resources;

(3) to encourage the self-financing post-secondary education sector to offer programmes in selected disciplines that meet Hong Kong's social and economic needs by providing targeted financial support; and

(4) to support the healthy and sustainable development of the self-financing post-secondary education sector to complement the University Grants Committee-funded sector in broadening and diversifying study opportunities.

The SSSDP has been expanded to include TUD programmes with effect from the 2023/24 academic year. As for the designated sub-degree programmes, the relevant details for the 2026/27 cohort, including the participating institutions, the sub-degree programmes, the numbers of subsidised places and the subsidy amounts, will be announced in due course.

Details of the SSSDP are available on the EDB website (www.cspe.edu.hk/sssdp)."
馬料水新渡輪碼頭今日啓用（附圖）,2025-09-09 14:15,2025-09-09 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900285.htm,"馬料水新渡輪碼頭（新碼頭）今日（九月九日）啓用，提供兩個泊位以分流現有馬料水渡輪碼頭和附近梯台的船隻和乘客流量，紓緩特別是假日的繁忙情況。

新碼頭是「改善碼頭計劃」下的項目，位於沙田科學園路馬料水三號梯台旁（見位置圖），供本地觀光船隻和街渡渡輪停泊上落客。現時利用三號梯台上落客的兩條固定班次街渡渡輪服務航線：馬料水—荔枝窩和馬料水—吉澳／鴨洲，本周六（九月十三日）起將改用新碼頭上落客；而馬料水—塔門和馬料水—東平洲兩條固定班次街渡渡輪服務航線將繼續使用馬料水渡輪碼頭上落客。

新碼頭採用浮動平台及斜台設計。由於浮動平台會隨海面升降，能與船隻保持在同一水平，方便船隻靠泊，乘客上落船隻亦更加安全和便捷；浮動平台以斜台連接到岸上，供有需要乘客使用。此外，岸上配備充電設施、Wi-Fi熱點及電子顯示屏等，方便使用者及豐富其體驗。

政府於二○一七年推出「改善碼頭計劃」，透過重建或增建公共碼頭，以及提升碼頭設施，改善新界及離島偏遠地方的對外海上交通，方便居民和遊客出行及滿足漁民作業需要。計劃現時涵蓋二十三個公眾碼頭，除了今日開放的馬料水新渡輪碼頭，南丫島北角碼頭及西貢滘西村碼頭已經啓用；十個碼頭正在興建中，當中七個將於二○二五年年底前陸續啓用，分別為大埔區荔枝莊碼頭、深涌碼頭及三門仔村碼頭、西貢區糧船灣碼頭、大嶼山二澳碼頭及馬灣涌碼頭，以及馬灣石仔灣碼頭；而南丫島榕樹灣公眾碼頭、長洲西灣碼頭及大嶼山大澳公眾碼頭的改善工程則預計於二○二六年完成；其餘碼頭正在規劃及設計階段，會適時有序地推展。"
Ma Liu Shui New Ferry Pier opens today (with photo),2025-09-09 14:15,2025-09-09 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900292.htm,"Ma Liu Shui New Ferry Pier is open for public use today (September 9), providing two berths to divert vessel and passenger traffic from the existing Ma Liu Shui Ferry Pier and the nearby landing steps, thereby alleviating congestion, especially during holidays.

The new pier, a project under the Pier Improvement Programme (PIP), is located next to Ma Liu Shui Landing No. 3 on Science Park Road in Sha Tin (see location map). It provides berths for local sightseeing vessels and kaito ferries for passenger boarding and alighting. Two regular kaito ferry service routes, namely Ma Liu Shui - Lai Chi Wo and Ma Liu Shui - Kat O/Ap Chau, currently using Landing No. 3 for boarding and alighting, will switch to the new pier starting this Saturday (September 13). The other two regular kaito ferry service routes, Ma Liu Shui - Tap Mun and Ma Liu Shui - Tung Ping Chau, will continue to use Ma Liu Shui Ferry Pier.

The new pier features a design with a floating platform and a gangway. As the floating platform rises and falls with the sea level, it remains at the same level as the vessels, making it easier for them to berth and for passengers to board and alight safely and conveniently. The floating platform is connected to the shore by a gangway for passengers in need. In addition, facilities including charging stations, a Wi-Fi hotspot and an information display panel are installed on the shore to enhance user convenience and experience.

Launched in 2017, the PIP aims to improve marine traffic to and from remote areas in the New Territories and outlying islands, facilitating access for residents and visitors while meeting the needs of fishermen's operations through reconstruction or construction of public piers and upgrading of pier facilities. The PIP currently involves 23 public piers. In addition to Ma Liu Shui New Ferry Pier, which is open today, Pak Kok Pier on Lamma Island and Kau Sai Village Pier in Sai Kung are already open for public use. Ten piers are under construction, seven of which will open progressively by the end of 2025. These include Lai Chi Chong Pier, Sham Chung Pier and Sam Mun Tsai Village Pier in Tai Po District; Leung Shuen Wan Pier in Sai Kung District; Yi O Pier and Ma Wan Chung Pier on Lantau; and Shek Tsai Wan Pier at Ma Wan. Improvement works for Yung Shue Wan Public Pier on Lamma Island, Sai Wan Jetty on Cheung Chau and Tai O Public Pier on Lantau are expected to be completed in 2026. The remaining piers are at the planning and design stages, and the projects will be taken forward in an orderly manner."

立法會秘書處發布「拓展全球經貿網絡」的《專題快訊》,2025-09-09 13:25,2025-09-09 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900440.htm,"下稿代立法會秘書處發出：

香港特區政府與貿易發展局主辦的第十屆「一帶一路高峰論壇」，將於本周三、四（九月十至十一日）在香港舉行。論壇匯聚多國政商界領袖，共同探討商機，是深化香港與「一帶一路」沿線國家和地區經貿聯繫的重要平台。適逢高峰論壇即將舉行，立法會秘書處（秘書處）今日（九月九日）發布最新一期《專題快訊》――「拓展全球經貿網絡」。

《專題快訊》概述香港在國家《十四五規劃》的支持下，發揮國際貿易中心角色的最新情況，包括香港在經貿方面的獨特優勢，以及如何發揮「超級連繫人」及「超級增值人」的角色，持續拓展經貿網絡，並綜述立法會相關討論。

《專題快訊》指出，香港憑藉自由貿易政策、世界級基礎設施、普通法制度和健全法治，以及「一國兩制」的制度優勢這四項「成功基因」，成為全球最具競爭力的貿易中心之一，香港特區政府亦一直多管齊下拓展全球經貿網絡。

《專題快訊》指出，香港積極擴展貿易及投資協定，與二十一個經濟體簽訂了自由貿易協定，以及與三十三個經濟體簽訂了促進和保護投資協定，與卡塔爾的投資協定談判亦大致完成。立法會議員建議政府尋求與更多經濟體，特別是東盟和中東新興市場，商定自貿和投資協定，以及協助港商開拓拉丁美洲市場。

《專題快訊》亦介紹，特區政府積極爭取加入全球規模最大的自貿協定《區域全面經濟伙伴關係協定》（RCEP），以減少國際貿易成本和貿易壁壘，並指出香港加入RCEP後，將深化成員間的貿易往來，協助它們參與「一帶一路」倡議，助力進入內地市場。立法會亦積極爭取多方支持香港盡早加入RCEP，包括在立法會主席率領下先後到東盟三國（即馬來西亞、印尼和新加坡）及日本進行職務考察，並接待了多國的駐港總領事和國會議員，向他們解說香港加入RCEP有助促進互惠共贏。議員又建議政府規劃北部都會區時，重點推動可受惠於RCEP的相關配套產業。

《專題快訊》亦臚列特區政府多項招商引資的工作，包括致力構建跨國供應鏈管理中心，吸引內地企業來港設立管理離岸貿易和供應鏈的國際或區域總部，協助內地企業「走出去」；透過《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》（CEPA），加大開拓內地貨物及服務貿易，增強香港對海外投資者的吸引力，同時讓香港成為內地企業「走出去」的最佳跳板，而去年簽訂的CEPA《服務貿易協議》的第二份修訂協議，讓香港的服務提供者更容易在內地設立企業和發展業務。

《專題快訊》指出，「一帶一路」倡議是格局宏大的國家長遠發展策略，香港憑藉獨特優勢成為共建「一帶一路」的首選功能平台，而特區政府積極拓展沿線新興巿場，近年重點工作包括行政長官訪問中東，加強與當地的經貿聯繫，擴展全球各地特別是新興市場的辦事處網絡，以及優化「BUD專項基金」，協助企業拓展境外市場。

《專題快訊》綜述議員對拓展全球經貿網絡的多項建議，包括建議當局全面統籌和加強招商引資工作，檢視和優化相關部門和公營機構的分工及職能，避免資源重疊；建立健全產業鏈和供應鏈，協助企業「引進來、走出去」；在更多領域訂立及推廣粵港澳大灣區標準，以便利港商利用CEPA的優惠措施進入內地市場；推動本地航空公司開辦更多來往香港與中東城市的國際航線，以便利經商旅遊，以及吸引「一帶一路」沿線國家企業和家族辦公室來港開設或擴展業務。

「拓展全球經貿網絡」的詳細內容可於立法會網頁瀏覽。《專題快訊》由秘書處議會事務部編製，旨在聚焦介紹特定議題、剖析政策發展，並綜述立法會相關討論。"
財經事務及庫務局局長在蘇州（香港）金融合作交流會致辭全文（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-09-09 13:00,2025-09-09 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900396.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇今日（九月九日）在蘇州（香港）金融合作交流會的致辭全文：

尊敬的林太（香港特別行政區第五任行政長官、江蘇省海外聯誼會名譽會長、江蘇省香港商會永遠榮譽會長林鄭月娥）、馬省長（江蘇省常務副省長馬欣）、顧市長（蘇州市常務副市長顧海東）、彩霞巡視員（國家金融監督管理總局國際合作司一級巡視員王彩霞）、各位重要嘉賓、金融業界朋友：

大家好。歡迎馬省長和顧市長帶領各位蘇州市的同事來到香港。很高興今天出席蘇州金融合作交流推介會，與各位就促進蘇州和香港金融合作交流，並見證《香港──蘇州金融協同發展行動方案》的簽署。

香港是蘇州市主要外資來源地。去年蘇州實際使用港資接近30億美元，佔全市實際使用外資額約百分之五十七。今年蘇州市政府工作報告強調要提升蘇州對外開放水平，主動擁抱全球化，着力打造雙向開放的國際門戶城市。在此基礎上，我認為香港作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」，正好可發揮作為國際金融中心的優勢，透過加強香港蘇州兩地的金融合作，達致互利共贏。合作方向我這裏也拋磚引玉提出四個可行的範疇。

第一，善用香港作為聯通內地與世界各地的「超級聯繫人」角色，助力蘇州企業拓展國際業務。香港擁有國際級一流的專業服務和豐富的國際交流合作經驗，是蘇州企業「走出去」，拓展「一帶一路」及海外市場的首選平台。無論是為大型基建項目融資、設立企業的離岸財資中心，還是設立專屬自保保險公司等，香港都能提供全面的專業服務，充分發揮既了解內地企業需求，又與國際市場接軌的優勢。

第二，深化資本市場聯通。在上市融資方面，香港一直擔當內地企業集資平台的角色。截至今年七月底，在香港上市的內地企業共有1 511家，當中有五家市值合共約900多億港元的蘇州企業。我們歡迎更多蘇州企業善用香港作為籌融資平台，包括透過香港交易所（香港交易及結算所有限公司）於前年推出的特專科技上市新章節上市融資。

第三，支持數字金融和金融科技創新。科技自立自強是國家強盛之基、安全之要，科技創新已經成為提高綜合國力的關鍵支撐。在金融領域，香港目前共有超過1 100家金融科技公司，涵蓋移動支付、跨境理財、人工智能金融服務顧問、財富及投資管理、合規科技等範疇。蘇州香港兩地金融機構和企業可以加強在金融科技技術研發和應用方面的合作。

第四，推動綠色金融發展。綠色金融對推動經濟社會可持續發展、實現雙碳目標有重要意義。香港可以進一步發揮國際金融中心的優勢，引導境外資金支持國家綠色和可持續發展。我們也知道今年剛好是「兩山」理念的二十周年慶典，所以這個綠色金融發展正好是非常好的時機，我們期待香港和蘇州加強綠色金融方面的交流合作，也歡迎蘇州政府和企業善用香港進行綠色融資，包括發行綠色債券。

女士們先生們，今日《香港──蘇州金融協同發展行動方案》的簽署，正好體現了剛才我提及的四大合作範疇。我期待未來與蘇州市政府進一步加強合作交流，實現互惠共贏，共同為國家金融高質量發展作出積極貢獻。謝謝。"

Speech by FS at AVPN Global Conference 2025 (English only) (with photos/video),2025-09-09 12:18,2025-09-09 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900388.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the AVPN Global Conference 2025 today (September 9):

Ms Batra (Chief Executive Officer of AVPN, Ms Naina Batra), Winfried (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC), Mr Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning.

  On behalf of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to you all.

  The AVPN conference brings together some of the most influential minds in philanthropy, family offices and impact investing. I would like to express my sincere thanks to AVPN and the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust for hosting this impactful event right here in Hong Kong.

  You are here because you all recognise a profound shift in the global investment narrative. You are here because you know the importance of forging partnerships and breaking silos. And you are here because Hong Kong stands as a global centre and a strategic hub for philanthropy, sustainable finance and impact investing.

  Today marks Day 2 of Hong Kong Green Week, and I’m delighted that impact investing is front and centre. This is an area that Hong Kong has made significant strides in recent years. As a global financial and business centre, and the gateway connecting the Chinese Mainland and the rest of the world, we have been doing well, particularly for the financial markets over the past year or so. But we know that doing well alone is no longer enough. The imperative of our time is clear: we must do good while doing well.

The Asian opportunity

  Indeed, Asia presents both an enormous need, and a tremendous opportunity, for impact investing.

  To put it into perspective: Asia is home to around 60 per cent of the world’s population and is undergoing an unprecedented economic transformation. Yet, the region is also highly vulnerable to natural disasters. In 2022, for example, 140 disasters struck this continent, resulting in economic damage equivalent to the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of Myanmar.

  The UN (United Nations) has estimated that Asia requires around US$1.5 trillion in annual investments to meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Apparently, the gap between need and available private capital is vast.

  Globally, the impact investing market has expanded rapidly, with AUM (assets under management) reaching US$1.6 trillion in 2024, more than double the total in 2020. The amount is projected to reach US$6 trillion by 2031. Yet, capital allocation for impact investing remains uneven. Studies show that North America accounts for 47 per cent, Europe 23 per cent, while South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia combined account for less than 15 per cent.

  But within this gap lies hope and immense potential. Asia is home to a fast-growing generation of wealth holders. According to market analysis, the region counted over 850 000 high-net-worth individuals in 2024. Many are not just wealthy entrepreneurs or heirs to fortunes. They are impact-minded leaders who seek to define their legacy through positive social and environmental change.

  With these trends and challenges, the key question is: How can we better connect opportunities with capital where it is needed most?

Hong Kong: a platform for purposeful capital

  This is exactly where Hong Kong comes in.

  Hong Kong has always been a super connector. A conduit for global capital and a value adder. We are built for this.

  Our world-class financial and legal systems as well as top-notch professional services are underpinned by the “one country, two systems” framework. We consistently rank among the world’s top cities, from business competitiveness to economic freedom, and from innovation prowess to talent quality. These make us uniquely positioned to serve as a launch pad for purpose-driven investments.

  For philanthropists and social businesses, Hong Kong offers access to global networks and best practices, institutions and talent, and a diverse pool of impact-first capital.

  One example is the Impact Link, launched by the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy last year. This platform connects donors and family offices with high-impact charitable initiatives, matching capital with projects of worthy causes. Our city is also home to a vibrant network of charitable organisations, NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and international foundations. They, of course, include the HKJC Charities Trust, which may well be Hong Kong’s largest charity donor.

  In fact, over the past three years, tax deductible charitable donations made by individuals and businesses stood at about HK$40 billion.

  We are magnifying this impact through proactive policies, such as providing tax concessions and attracting more family offices which are forces for good. And our policy statement for developing family offices offers a clear roadmap to support the growth of family offices.

  Our ESG (environmental, social and governance) and green finance ecosystem is one of the most vibrant in Asia. In 2024, Hong Kong issued over US$80 billion in sustainable debt, with green bonds making up 45 per cent of the regional total. Today, more than 200 ESG funds are authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission with a combined AUM exceeding US$140 billion.

  We are also innovating. From tokenised green bonds to more thematic ESG ETFs (exchange traded funds), we are expanding the suite of financial instruments and product offerings.

  Beyond finance, the Greater Bay Area, including Hong Kong, is fast rising as the world’s leading innovation cluster. Start-ups here are developing transformative solutions, ranging from AI-powered greentech to medtech and inclusive fintech, all designed to solve real-world problems and promote equitable development.

  Indeed, across the Chinese Mainland and Asia, a new wave of innovation is emerging, brimming with tech start-ups and enterprises. They are offering scalable, tech-enabled solutions to address our most pressing challenges like climate change.

  With these advantages, Hong Kong is keen to create a seamless ecosystem where capital can be efficiently structured, deployed and scaled for maximum sustainable impact, both within our region and across the globe.

  At our core, Hong Kong believes in collaboration. We are committed to building strong, cross-sector partnerships that create value for all.

Step forward: showcasing our capability

  In this connection, understanding how to mobilise impact capital effectively is crucial. I am pleased to note that tomorrow, our Financial Services Development Council will launch a special report right here at this conference.

  That report will highlight real-world case studies that showcase how Hong Kong is already serving as a powerful agent in mobilising impact capital. I hope you will find inspiration and actionable insight in its pages. 

Conclusion

  Ladies and gentlemen, we live in uncertain times. But gatherings like this one give me tremendous hope. 

  You are the change makers, the architects of a more inclusive and sustainable future. And Hong Kong is your committed partner. We are ready, willing and uniquely positioned to help you channel capital for purpose, connect ambition with action, and turn the vision of doing good into a reality that changes lives.

  Enjoy the rich discussions over the next few days. Let us learn from one another, forge new partnerships, and leave here ready to build a better world, together. Thank you."

車輛領牌新規例十二月二十二日實施　及時妥善處理未領牌車輛免被檢控,2025-09-09 11:50,2025-09-09 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090400327.htm,"運輸署今日（九月九日）表示，將於十二月二十二日實施新的車輛登記及領牌制度，加強規管長期未領牌的車輛。在新制度下，未領牌車輛將一直登記在車主名下，車主須為其車輛負上責任。新規例同時引入新罪行以提高阻嚇力，從源頭解決不當棄置車輛的問題。

運輸署發言人說：「由十二月二十二日起，署方將向兩年或以上未領牌車輛的登記車主發出通知書，要求車主必須在發出通知書日期的三個月內為車輛領牌，或把車輛拆毀或永久送離香港後向署方取消登記。車主須及時妥善處理車輛，以免觸犯法例。」

如車主在該三個月通知期屆滿前仍不採取行動，即屬犯罪。首次定罪最高可罰款10,000元和監禁三個月；其後每次定罪最高可罰款25,000元和監禁六個月。除非已繳付罰款，否則運輸署可根據法庭命令：（一）拒絕向被定罪車主發出或續發駕駛執照；（二）不處理涉事車輛的過戶申請；及（三）拒絕向涉事車輛或被定罪車主名下其他車輛發出車輛牌照。

個別車主如有實際困難而未能在三個月通知期屆滿前採取所需行動，或有合理理由不為其車輛領牌，可向運輸署申請豁免。一般而言，以下三種情況可獲豁免：（一）等待零件維修送驗後續牌的車輛；（二）車齡30年或以上、正妥善保存作私人收藏而不會在路上使用的車輛；或（三）妥善保存於車輛經銷商作寄賣的車輛。車主如有其他合理理由，可向署方提出；署方會視乎個案情況考慮是否批出豁免。申請豁免的資格和指引將於稍後公布。

發言人提醒車主，即使未為車輛領牌或獲批豁免，車輛仍會一直登記在其名下，車主須繼續承擔車輛引起的所有法律責任。運輸署自二○二四年十二月起透過車主於辦理牌照申請時提供的電子聯絡方式，向車輛牌照到期前一個月、剛逾期或已逾期超過兩年的車主發出短訊或電郵，提醒登記車主必須適時續領車輛牌照或妥善處置車輛。

同時，署方已加強宣傳和公眾教育，提醒車主及早處理名下兩年或以上未領牌車輛。車主可善用運輸署的「牌證易」網上平台，查閱名下車輛牌照屆滿日期、處理各類牌照事務及妥善處理名下未領牌車輛。市民可參閱運輸署網頁了解詳情，或致電熱線2804 2600查詢。"
Handle unlicensed vehicles properly in timely manner to avoid prosecutions following new vehicle licensing regulation taking effect on December 22,2025-09-09 11:50,2025-09-09 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090400353.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (September 9) said that the new vehicle registration and licensing regime will take effect on December 22 to strengthen regulations on prolonged unlicensed vehicles. Under the new regime, unlicensed vehicles will remain registered under the name of owners, who will continue to be held responsible for their vehicles. A new offence will also be introduced to heighten deterrence against improper abandoning of vehicles for addressing the problem at the source.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""Starting from December 22, we will issue a notice to registered owners of vehicles unlicensed for two years or more. Vehicle owners must, within three months of the date of notice, renew the licence, or cancel the registration of such vehicles with the TD after scrapping them or permanently shipping them out of Hong Kong. They should handle their vehicles properly and in a timely manner to avoid contravening the law.""

  Failing to take action upon expiry of the three-month notice period will constitute an offence. The maximum penalty for the first conviction will be a fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for three months. For each subsequent conviction, the maximum penalty will be a $25,000 fine and six months' imprisonment. Unless the fine is paid, the TD may, subject to the court's order, (1) refuse to issue or renew the driving licence of a convicted vehicle owner; (2) take no action on any application for transfer of ownership of the subject vehicle; and (3) refuse to issue a vehicle licence to the subject vehicle or any other vehicles under the convicted owner's name.

  Individual vehicle owners who have a genuine difficulty in taking the required actions within the three-month notice period or have reasonable grounds for not licensing their vehicles may apply for an exemption from the TD. In general, exemptions may be granted under the following three scenarios: (1) vehicles pending spare parts for maintenance and examination before licence renewal; (2) vehicles manufactured for 30 years or more, properly stored as a private collection and not used on roads; or (3) vehicles properly stored by a car dealer and consigned for sale. Vehicle owners may provide other reasonable grounds for the TD's consideration of granting an exemption based on individual cases. The eligibility criteria and guidelines for exemption will be announced later.

  The spokesman reminded vehicle owners that, even when a vehicle remains unlicensed or is granted an exemption, it will remain registered under their name and they have to continue to bear all legal liabilities associated with it. Since December 2024 the TD has started issuing SMS messages or emails to registered owners whose vehicle licences will expire in one month, have just expired or have expired for two years via the e-contact means they provided in their licensing applications, to remind them that they must renew their vehicle licence or properly handle their vehicles in time.

  The TD has also stepped up publicity and public education to remind vehicle owners to take action early for vehicles unlicensed for two years or more. Vehicle owners may make use of the e-Licensing Portal to check the vehicle licence expiry date, handle licensing matters and take proper action on their unlicensed vehicles. Members of the public may refer to the TD's website for details, or call the hotline at 2804 2600 for enquiries."

Speech by CE at HK-Asean Summit 2025 (English only) (with photos/video),2025-09-09 11:18,2025-09-09 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900325.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the HK-Asean Summit 2025 today (September 9):

Honourable Minister Anthony (Minister of Transport of Malaysia, Mr Loke Siew Fook), Secretary Rodolfo (Undersecretary for the Industry Development Group of the Department of Trade and Industry of Philippines, Dr Ceferino Rodolfo), Ms Catherine So (Chief Executive Officer of the South China Morning Post),Dr Daryl Ng (Chairman of the Hong Kong-ASEAN Foundation), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. I am very delighted to join you today at the 2025 Hong Kong-Asean Summit.

  This is, I'm pleased to say, the fourth consecutive year I've addressed this Summit, an annual event created to put a bright spotlight on the dynamic and mutually rewarding ties between Hong Kong and ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

  Allow me first to welcome Minister Loke, our good friend from Malaysia, together with many other senior government officials, business leaders and distinguished guests from ASEAN and beyond.

  Indeed, some 400 of you are here today, with another 300 or so taking in this year's Summit virtually, and you'll be hearing from 20 prominent speakers from some 30 countries and regions. Your presence underscores the enduring strength of our partnership, and shared commitment, to enhancing regional development and prosperity.

  There are good reasons for our partnership. The recent rise of protectionism and unilateralism is creating significant uncertainties in international trade, damaging trading systems and escalating geopolitical risks.

  In such trying times, it is all the more important for like-minded economies to work together, upholding multilateralism with an open, rules-based order. Hong Kong has long been a free port and a champion of multilateral trade. That's why we attach great importance to our relations with ASEAN, whose 10 member states share similar values and a clear commitment to promoting free and open trade.

  And that's why the ASEAN region was the destination of my first overseas visit, after assuming office some three years ago. Over the years, I'm glad to have led high-level business delegations from Hong Kong to visit seven different ASEAN countries, concluding some 90 documents of co-operation on various fronts.

   ASEAN, after all, is the third-most populous region and fifth-largest economy in the world.

  For 15 years in a row, ASEAN has been Hong Kong's second-largest merchandise trading partner. Last year, our trade was valued at more than US$165 billion, up almost 15 per cent over the previous year.

  And our merchandise trade in the first half of this year continued to soar, I'm delighted to note, rising nearly one quarter. Our services trade is equally cheering, climbing about 30 per cent, year-on-year, and reaching US$18 billion in 2023, making ASEAN our third-largest services trading partner.

  We like to invest in each other's opportunities, too. ASEAN is Hong Kong's third-largest outward investment destination, and sixth-largest source of inward direct investment.

  More than our long years of friendship, the robust relationship between us is backed by the ASEAN-Hong Kong, China Free Trade Agreement and its related Investment Agreement. They have been in full force since 2021, with the linked Economic and Technical Co-operation Work Programme focused on ensuring continuing trade and investment growth.

  Last year, the number of offices set up in Hong Kong with parent companies located in ASEAN grew 13 per cent. Some 730 ASEAN companies now call Hong Kong home.

  There are plenty of good reasons for ASEAN companies to look to Hong Kong for their future. Long the world's freest economy, Hong Kong was also the world's seventh-largest merchandise trading entity last year.

  This year, the International Institute for Management Development's World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Hong Kong third, globally, in competitiveness. That is the second year, in a row, that we've gone up two places in this ranking, and our first return to the global top three since 2019.

  More good news. Just this morning, the Institute released its annual World Talent Ranking, in which Hong Kong's ranking rose to fourth, globally, and first in the Asia Pacific. This is our highest-ever position in the ranking, having climbed up five places from last year. Indeed, our ranking rose 12 places over the past two years, a clear testament to the HKSAR Government's enhanced efforts in education and talent development.

  The World Talent Ranking, I'm pleased to add, recognises Hong Kong's outstanding academic achievement, ranking us first in the indicator ""Graduates in Sciences"".

  Yes, Hong Kong is the only city in the globe with as many as five universities in the world's top 100. Our excellent institutions nurture world-class scientists and research talent in different disciplines.

  Leveraging that strength, Hong Kong is fast rising as an innovation and technology hub. Earlier this month, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster topped the world - for the first time - in the World Intellectual Property Organization's annual Global Innovation Index.

  All three cities in the cluster are core cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, a cluster city development that brings together a population of 87 million.

  By synergising Hong Kong's research prowess with the Mainland's innovation and manufacturing capabilities, we are committed to becoming one of the world's leading I&T centres.

  And, as one of the world's top three international financial centres, Hong Kong has the liquidity, along with the angel investors, venture capital and private equity funds, to drive innovation and innovative companies. These, ladies and gentlemen, present far-reaching opportunities for ASEAN companies and entrepreneurs looking to tap into the vast and promising markets of the Mainland.

  And we are continually seeking to expand our co-operation and ties. In addition to our Economic and Trade Offices in Singapore, Jakarta and Bangkok, we are working closely with the Malaysian Government to open a fourth ASEAN-based Office in Kuala Lumpur.

  I am pleased to note that excellent progress has been made towards establishing this new office, and I am sure our ties with ASEAN will reach another level entirely with the new addition.

  Then there's the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest free trade bloc. The theme of this year's Summit, ""Bridging Horizons, Building Futures"", seems to me to speak to the value and contributions Hong Kong will add to the Partnership with our accession.

  That includes serving as a multilevel bridge between the Chinese Mainland and ASEAN. Ladies and gentlemen, I count on your continuing support in realising Hong Kong's bid for accession.

  Trade and investment aside, we enjoy close people-to-people ties and exchanges. We have relaxed the criteria for nationals of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam in applying for multi-entry visas for travel and business. And we have extended their validity period from two to three years.

  We are, as well, providing self-service immigration clearance for invited visitors participating in business, development and related activities from all ASEAN countries.

  Those ""related activities"" include enjoying the world-class arts, culture and entertainment, everywhere you turn, in Hong Kong, a world city rising as the East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. Sports exchange and excitement, too, thanks to our world-class facilities, including new, state-of-the-art Kai Tak Sports Park. Or a fond exchange with our six cuddly giant pandas, right here in Ocean Park.

  Before I go, allow me to mention that Hong Kong's Belt and Road Summit, the 10th anniversary edition, opens tomorrow. The annual event attracts government officials and business leaders and investors from Hong Kong, the Mainland and throughout the region, including those from ASEAN states.

  Hong Kong, of course, plays a key role in our country's Belt and Road Initiative. It's part of our continuing contribution to regional connectivity. I look forward to seeing you there.

  Because we believe in partnership. Despite all the uncertainties and unease across the globe, Hong Kong holds on to the belief that free trade is the backbone for boosting global output. It's the key ingredient for a more interconnected, peaceful and productive world economy.

  As Hong Kong and ASEAN deepen our collaboration, we are paving the way for stronger economic partnerships and enhanced regional connectivity, creating opportunities for shared growth and prosperity. Together, we are not afraid of storms. United, we will sail our ships, through thick and thin, whether it is Typhoon Nine, Typhoon Eight, or Typhoon Eight-Goodbye.

  In closing, my thanks to the South China Morning Post for once again hosting this significant annual gathering, made for business, for networking, for creating partnerships and enduring co-operation. And that, ladies and gentlemen, will ensure that today's trying times soon give way to inspiring times. Rewarding times for us all.

  I wish you the best of business and a memorable stay in Hong Kong.

  Thank you."
商務及經濟發展局局長在海南自貿港推介暨政策解讀會致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-09-09 11:18,2025-09-09 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900350.htm,"以下是商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺今日（九月九日）在海南自貿港推介暨政策解讀會的致辭全文：

尊敬的馮飛書記（海南省委書記）、尹宗華副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、李永勝副特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署副特派員）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家早上好，今天很高興出席海南省在香港舉辦的海南自貿港推介暨政策解讀會，首先我謹代表特區政府歡迎馮書記率團訪問香港。

海南與香港地緣相近，人員互動、物流和資金流的往來都十分頻繁。香港是海南最主要的外資來源地，不少香港企業在海南開展業務。單單是去年，海南新成立的香港企業就有700多家，實際利用香港直接投資的金額超過150億人民幣，增幅超過9%。

港商在海南的投資十分廣泛，涵蓋了商業地產、醫療健康、旅遊零售等多個領域，瓊港合作近年更上一層樓，擴展到金融合作、專業資格認證、青年創業等不同領域。同時，海南近年也積極投資香港，連續三年在香港發行離岸人民幣債券，海南省更是內地第一個使用香港融資平台和專業服務發債的省份。

特區政府非常重視瓊港兩地的合作交流。今年三月，在行政長官訪問海南期間，與馮書記一同見證了特區政府和海南省簽署的一系列加強雙邊合作的備忘錄，涵蓋經貿投資、金融、數據安全流動、旅遊，以及人才交流等五個領域，推動海南自貿港構建，同時也為香港的專業服務和資本提供更廣闊的發展空間，實現香港與海南省企業一同拼船出海，全面發揮瓊港兩地的優勢，一同走向世界市場。

海南自貿港的建設將於今年十二月十八日正式啓動，迎來歷史一刻，一系列自由便利的進出措施，將擴大海南對外開放的水平，助力加強包括人流、物流和資金流等要素在海南自由流通。海南省這次在香港舉辦的政策解讀會正逢其時，加深香港企業對海南自貿港發展的了解，同時推動更廣、更深、更高水平的交流合作，共同發展新質生產力。

在「一國兩制」下，香港擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的優勢，特區政府會全力發揮好香港作為「超級連繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，發揮香港所長，促進粵港澳大灣區與海南自貿港的聯動發展，同時引入國際項目到海南、服務海南資金投資海外市場，與海南創造更多互利共贏的合作，共同為國家的高質量發展和提升經濟動能作出貢獻。

謝謝。"
Speech by CE at HK-Asean Summit 2025 (English only) (with photos),2025-09-09 11:18,2025-09-09 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900325.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the HK-Asean Summit 2025 today (September 9):

Honourable Minister Anthony (Minister of Transport of Malaysia, Mr Loke Siew Fook), Secretary Rodolfo (Undersecretary for the Industry Development Group of the Department of Trade and Industry of Philippines, Dr Ceferino Rodolfo), Ms Catherine So (Chief Executive Officer of the South China Morning Post),Dr Daryl Ng (Chairman of the Hong Kong-ASEAN Foundation), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. I am very delighted to join you today at the 2025 Hong Kong-Asean Summit.

  This is, I'm pleased to say, the fourth consecutive year I've addressed this Summit, an annual event created to put a bright spotlight on the dynamic and mutually rewarding ties between Hong Kong and ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

  Allow me first to welcome Minister Loke, our good friend from Malaysia, together with many other senior government officials, business leaders and distinguished guests from ASEAN and beyond.

  Indeed, some 400 of you are here today, with another 300 or so taking in this year's Summit virtually, and you'll be hearing from 20 prominent speakers from some 30 countries and regions. Your presence underscores the enduring strength of our partnership, and shared commitment, to enhancing regional development and prosperity.

  There are good reasons for our partnership. The recent rise of protectionism and unilateralism is creating significant uncertainties in international trade, damaging trading systems and escalating geopolitical risks.

  In such trying times, it is all the more important for like-minded economies to work together, upholding multilateralism with an open, rules-based order. Hong Kong has long been a free port and a champion of multilateral trade. That's why we attach great importance to our relations with ASEAN, whose 10 member states share similar values and a clear commitment to promoting free and open trade.

  And that's why the ASEAN region was the destination of my first overseas visit, after assuming office some three years ago. Over the years, I'm glad to have led high-level business delegations from Hong Kong to visit seven different ASEAN countries, concluding some 90 documents of co-operation on various fronts.

   ASEAN, after all, is the third-most populous region and fifth-largest economy in the world.

  For 15 years in a row, ASEAN has been Hong Kong's second-largest merchandise trading partner. Last year, our trade was valued at more than US$165 billion, up almost 15 per cent over the previous year.

  And our merchandise trade in the first half of this year continued to soar, I'm delighted to note, rising nearly one quarter. Our services trade is equally cheering, climbing about 30 per cent, year-on-year, and reaching US$18 billion in 2023, making ASEAN our third-largest services trading partner.

  We like to invest in each other's opportunities, too. ASEAN is Hong Kong's third-largest outward investment destination, and sixth-largest source of inward direct investment.

  More than our long years of friendship, the robust relationship between us is backed by the ASEAN-Hong Kong, China Free Trade Agreement and its related Investment Agreement. They have been in full force since 2021, with the linked Economic and Technical Co-operation Work Programme focused on ensuring continuing trade and investment growth.

  Last year, the number of offices set up in Hong Kong with parent companies located in ASEAN grew 13 per cent. Some 730 ASEAN companies now call Hong Kong home.

  There are plenty of good reasons for ASEAN companies to look to Hong Kong for their future. Long the world's freest economy, Hong Kong was also the world's seventh-largest merchandise trading entity last year.

  This year, the International Institute for Management Development's World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Hong Kong third, globally, in competitiveness. That is the second year, in a row, that we've gone up two places in this ranking, and our first return to the global top three since 2019.

  More good news. Just this morning, the Institute released its annual World Talent Ranking, in which Hong Kong's ranking rose to fourth, globally, and first in the Asia Pacific. This is our highest-ever position in the ranking, having climbed up five places from last year. Indeed, our ranking rose 12 places over the past two years, a clear testament to the HKSAR Government's enhanced efforts in education and talent development.

  The World Talent Ranking, I'm pleased to add, recognises Hong Kong's outstanding academic achievement, ranking us first in the indicator ""Graduates in Sciences"".

  Yes, Hong Kong is the only city in the globe with as many as five universities in the world's top 100. Our excellent institutions nurture world-class scientists and research talent in different disciplines.

  Leveraging that strength, Hong Kong is fast rising as an innovation and technology hub. Earlier this month, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster topped the world - for the first time - in the World Intellectual Property Organization's annual Global Innovation Index.

  All three cities in the cluster are core cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, a cluster city development that brings together a population of 87 million.

  By synergising Hong Kong's research prowess with the Mainland's innovation and manufacturing capabilities, we are committed to becoming one of the world's leading I&T centres.

  And, as one of the world's top three international financial centres, Hong Kong has the liquidity, along with the angel investors, venture capital and private equity funds, to drive innovation and innovative companies. These, ladies and gentlemen, present far-reaching opportunities for ASEAN companies and entrepreneurs looking to tap into the vast and promising markets of the Mainland.

  And we are continually seeking to expand our co-operation and ties. In addition to our Economic and Trade Offices in Singapore, Jakarta and Bangkok, we are working closely with the Malaysian Government to open a fourth ASEAN-based Office in Kuala Lumpur.

  I am pleased to note that excellent progress has been made towards establishing this new office, and I am sure our ties with ASEAN will reach another level entirely with the new addition.

  Then there's the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest free trade bloc. The theme of this year's Summit, ""Bridging Horizons, Building Futures"", seems to me to speak to the value and contributions Hong Kong will add to the Partnership with our accession.

  That includes serving as a multilevel bridge between the Chinese Mainland and ASEAN. Ladies and gentlemen, I count on your continuing support in realising Hong Kong's bid for accession.

  Trade and investment aside, we enjoy close people-to-people ties and exchanges. We have relaxed the criteria for nationals of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam in applying for multi-entry visas for travel and business. And we have extended their validity period from two to three years.

  We are, as well, providing self-service immigration clearance for invited visitors participating in business, development and related activities from all ASEAN countries.

å°æ¬çæä¸»ä»» (CPC Committee Member and Vice Chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, Mr Li Zhen)ãChairman Gao (Chairman of GTI, Mr Gao Tongqing), Chairman Ehrlich (Chairman of GTI, Mr Craig Ehrlich), Mr Li (Executive Vice President of China Mobile, Mr Li Huidi), Professor Chao (Vice President (Research and Innovation) of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Professor Christopher Chao), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning! It is my great pleasure to speak again at the GTI Forum on Digital Intelligence · Hong Kong. For those who are visiting Hong Kong for the first time, a big welcome to Hong Kong, and I wish you a pleasant stay to explore the wonders of this vibrant city.

  The recent announcement by the World Intellectual Property Organization ranking the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster as number one in its index of the world's top 100 innovation clusters in the Global Innovation Index 2025 is a resounding affirmation of our region's visionary commitment to innovation and technology (I&T). This recognition not only celebrates our collective achievements, but also reinforces Hong Kong's strategic position in the global I&T landscape.
 
  Thanks to GTI, who have chosen Hong Kong to host the forum for two consecutive years. This reflects not only GTI's recognition of Hong Kong's crucial role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"", but also the confidence that you have placed in Hong Kong as a promising, global hub of I&T.

  Among the many emerging technologies in this I&T era, artificial intelligence (AI) has been at its forefront in recent years. The focus of the GTI Forum is no exception, as evidenced from the forum programme, which will take us through the development, opportunities and challenges of AI in the coming two days.

  Recognising the great potential of AI, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government has introduced a number of initiatives to support and drive the local AI ecosystem. On digital infrastructure, our local I&T flagship Cyberport has commenced operation of its AI Supercomputing Centre (AISC) since last December to advance AI research and applications. Its computing power will ramp up within this year. Leveraging the AISC, we also provide subsidies to its eligible users, such as local institutions, research and development (R&D) centres, enterprises and start-ups through the $3 billion AI Subsidy Scheme to encourage the R&D of potential groundbreaking AI.

  Another initiative spearheaded by the Hong Kong SAR Government to support AI R&D is the AIR@InnoHK Research Cluster. It is a collaboration with leading R&D institutions locally and globally, that drives advancements in AI and robotics technologies. The cluster has set up 15 R&D labs, including the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center, HKGAI in short. In this February, the HKGAI launched its homegrown AI large language model, and integrated it into a generative AI document processing copilot application (HKPilot). The AI copilot application has been widely adopted for trial use within the Government in respect of drafting, translation and summarising of documents.

  In addition, we have further earmarked $1 billion for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI R&D Institute. This new institute, which is targeted to be set up in 2026, will spearhead AI development and industry applications in Hong Kong, as well as to facilitate upstream R&D, midstream and downstream transformation of R&D outcomes and expand application scenarios.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the above are just a few examples of our I&T initiatives to foster a vibrant local AI ecosystem. I am confident that with the concerted efforts of the Government, industry, academia, research institutes and investment sectors, our AI ecosystem will thrive and bring promising opportunities to Hong Kong, Mainland China and the world.

  Before I close, may I wish the GTI Forum another year of great success and everyone a rewarding journey. Thank you."
