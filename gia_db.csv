​政府調整交通相關費用和定額罰款,2025-07-09 13:32,2025-07-09 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900333.htm,"政府今日（七月九日）宣布，建議調整四項與交通相關的費用，包括隧道收費、電動私家車牌照費、停車收費錶最高收費，以及交通違例事項定額罰款。

運輸及物流局發言人說：「二零二五至二六年度《財政預算案》公布政府會重點檢視多年未曾調整的交通收費和定額罰款。我們的總體考量是提升交通管理，以及維持公共財政紀律，以體現『收回成本』和『用者自付』原則。」

為此，政府制定合共四項法例修訂：

（一）《2025年行車隧道（政府）（修訂）（第2號）規例》──調整隧道收費

政府以科學為本，以四大原則按優次檢視了政府隧道和主幹道的收費，包括交通管理需要、效率優先、公共交通優先，以及「用者自付」。在綜合考慮上述四項原則和每條隧道和主幹道的具體情況，決定建議調高香港仔隧道和城門隧道的隧道費，並就使用中九龍繞道徵收隧道費。香港仔隧道和城門隧道的新收費將於二○二五年九月二十一日生效；中九龍繞道將於二○二六年全線通車時，開始實施收費。詳情如下：





現行隧道費
			（所有車輛全日劃一收費）
建議隧道費
			（所有車輛全日劃一收費）


香港仔隧道
5元
8元


城門隧道
5元
8元


中九龍繞道（油麻地段隧道）
／
8元




運輸及物流局發言人說：「香港仔隧道和城門隧道已34年未有調整收費，至今通脹已超過百分之一百三十，隧道出現營運虧損。調整收費至8元對交通造成的影響輕微，隧道營運可因此達致收支平衡。另一方面，中九龍繞道將紓緩現時九龍主要幹道的交通，路程短、車速高，對駕駛者的吸引力甚大。如中九龍繞道不予收費，預計剛開通使用率便將接近飽和。考慮到立法會交通事務委員會及回應社會意見，並吸引更多駕駛者使用，以達致有效分流，政府現提出8元收費。相關收費水平將有效分流九龍區內主要繁忙道路整體約百分之二十的車流之餘，亦能為繞道保留約百分之十五的剩餘容車量以應付未來交通增長，並可收回近八成的基本營運成本；而按效率優先原則，商用車輛和公交車輛須繳付的費用與體積較小的私家車的溫和收費一致。」

發言人續指：「我們亦已按上述四項原則逐一審視其他政府隧道及主幹道。總括而言，考慮到其他政府隧道及主幹道的交通管理和流量、替代路線的交通流量，以及與每條路線相關未來的交通基建配套，例如新的替代路線落成，我們建議暫時維持它們現有的收費安排，適時再作檢視。」

（二）《2025年道路交通（車輛登記及領牌）（修訂）（第4號）規例》──理順電動私家車牌照費架構和水平

現時，電動私家車的牌照費按車輛淨重收費，電動私家車的牌照費與燃油私家車的牌照費之間的差距為約六倍。政府建議調整電動私家車每年牌照費的收費架構，改以電動私家車的額定功率收取牌照費，把電動私家車的牌照費結構按額定功率分為五個層級，並適當地調整牌照費水平，調整進程會分五階段在六年間進行，以配合科技發展和緊貼其他地區做法。新牌照費架構將於二○二五年十一月一日起實施，適用於新登記的電動私家車，而現有電動私家車可獲四個月寬限期。詳情撮述如下：

擁有電動私家車的合資格傷殘人士會獲得電動私家車牌照費寬減安排（註）。

運輸及物流局發言人說：「考慮到立法會交通事務委員會的意見，電動私家車的牌照費調整分五階段逐步實施，讓市民有較長的適應期。新的電動私家車牌照費水平完成調整後，與現時燃油車的牌照費比較，仍會低百分之二十五（第五層級）至百分之四十（第一層級）不等，以繼續鼓勵駕駛者轉用電動車，推動環保。按現時登記電動私家車的類型分布，有百分之九十九的車輛處於第一、二及三層級；而處於第四及第五層級的車輛數目比例僅分別為百分之一和百分之零點一。隨着電動車日趨普及，市場上有越來越多電動車品牌和型號選擇，同時電動車燃料費用及維修保養費較燃油車低，我們預計在新措施下，電動車仍維持吸引力。」

（三）《2025年道路交通（泊車）（修訂）規例》──調整停車收費錶收費

為妥善運用有限的泊車位資源，政府建議調整使用停車收費錶泊車位（俗稱「咪錶」）的最高收費，由每15分鐘2元調整至每15分鐘4元，即每小時最高收費為16元，以加快停車收費錶泊車位的流轉，滿足駕駛者短期泊車需求。新收費將於二○二五年九月二十八日起實施。至於貨車、巴士及旅遊巴士泊車位的現有收費錶收費水平，一律維持不變。

（四）根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》（第237章）和《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》（第240章）動議的擬議決議案──調整交通違例事項定額罰款

為加強保障交通安全和交通暢順，政府建議違例泊車的定額罰款額由現時320元調高至400元（調整幅度為百分之二十五），其他與道路安全和交通擠塞相關的十九項（詳見附件）違例事項的定額罰款額由現時的320元至1,000元不等，調高至480元至1,500元不等（調整幅度為百分之五十）。其他交通罪行的罰款額則維持不變。

運輸及物流局發言人說：「違例泊車和大部分交通違例事項的定額罰款已31年未曾調整，罰款額的阻嚇力或因期間的通脹而有所抵銷；而事實上，香港的交通違例事項的定額罰款水平遠較多個其他地區為低。我們注意到部分交通罪行數字仍有上升或居高不下的趨勢。調整相關交通罪行的罰款額有助提高阻嚇力，加強保障道路安全和暢順。與此同時，政府會致力加大泊車位供應，以盡量滿足泊車需求。」

《2025年行車隧道（政府）（修訂）（第2號）規例》、《2025年道路交通（車輛登記及領牌）（修訂）（第4號）規例》，以及《2025年道路交通（泊車）（修訂）規例》將於七月十八日刊憲，並於七月二十三日提交立法會進行先訂立後審議的程序。至於《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》（第237章）和《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》（第240章）附表的交通違例事項的罰則，立法會可藉決議修訂（按先審議後訂立的程序），運輸及物流局局長將於七月三十日的立法會會議上動議通過決議。有關立法建議和生效日期分別在各修訂規例及擬議決議案中訂明，相關資料載列於政府於今日發出的立法會參考資料摘要。

註：如合資格傷殘人士名下電動私家車的額定功率不超過75千瓦，則無須繳付牌照費。如其額定功率超過75千瓦，其應繳每年牌照費為其額定功率層級訂明的每年牌照費減去額定功率不超過75千瓦的電動私家車所應繳的每年牌照費。"

答覆：

主席：

為應對院舍人手不足和新增的人手需求，以及協助院舍業界提升服務質素，政府二○二三年六月推出「院舍輸入護理員特別計劃」（「特別計劃」），在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，適度容許安老院及殘疾人士院舍輸入護理員。「特別計劃」推出時設有7000個輸入配額，包括原有經「補充勞工計劃」已輸入的約4000名護理員。有關名額於二○二四年上半年接近用罄。政府在檢視業界對護理員的需求和人手供應情況後，同年七月公布把配額上限提高至15000個，在隨後三年分批提供予院舍申請。

就議員的提問，綜合社會福利署（社署）、勞工處及政府統計處（統計處）的資料及數據，現答覆如下：

（一）至（三）過去三年全港安老院及殘疾人士院舍所聘用的本地及輸入護理員人數載於附件一。「特別計劃」首五輪的申請和審批結果詳情載於附件二，其中約400宗個案遭拒絕，不獲批的主要原因包括該輪申請可獲分配的配額已用罄或申請不符合「特別計劃」的規定。第六輪申請在二○二五年五月六日截止，社署正處理約500個新配額申請。

社署有五名人員專責推行「特別計劃」，包括社會工作主任職系、行政主任職系及文書職系的人員。為保障本地勞工的就業機會，社署會抽查申請參與「特別計劃」的院舍所遞交的「本地招聘確認書」，確保院舍已經通過社署署長指定途徑招聘本地人手，但未能填補空缺。至二○二五年三月，社署共抽查約300份院舍本地招聘記錄，佔申請總數超過一成，沒有發現院舍蓄意或存心提交不正確資料，該段期間也沒有院舍遭行政制裁。

（四）至（六）勞工處共有37名勞工督察負責巡查輸入勞工的工作地點及僱主在香港為輸入勞工提供的居所。過去兩年，勞工督察共進行4407次有關輸入護理員的巡查（包括補充勞工計劃／優化補充勞工計劃以及「特別計劃」下的個案），包括2298次僱傭地點巡查及2109次居所巡查。巡查如發現輸入勞工的僱傭權益受損，勞工處會立即跟進調查。視察巡查過程中收到的投訴已計入整體投訴個案數字。

自二○二三年六月推出「特別計劃」至二○二五年五月，勞工處和社署共接獲47宗懷疑院舍違反法例或「特別計劃」規定的投訴。投訴事項主要涉及工資（包括工資回扣及短付工資）及工作安排。上述投訴個案中，有八宗涉及院舍涉嫌以輸入護理員取代在職本地護理員，其中七‍宗投訴已完成調查，並沒有發現違規事項，而餘下一宗仍在調查中。同期，勞工處成功檢控一名在「特別計劃」下聘用輸入護理員的僱主，該僱主違反《僱員補償條例》，未有投購有效的僱員補償保險，被法庭判處罰款2,500元。社署正審視有關個案，會按情況考慮施加行政制裁。

自「特別計劃」推出至今，投訴、檢控及定罪個案的數字按年表列如下：

（七）「特別計劃」規定，本地護理員的薪金必須不低於輸入護理員，而輸入護理員的薪金不得低於統計處最新編製的護理員每月工資中位數（註一）。護理員每月中位工資根據統計處在五月至六月期間進行的「收入及工時按年統計調查」所搜集的數據編製而成，統計處多年來均沿用此方式統計不同行業的工資中位數。就院舍護理員的工資中位數而言，抽樣的院舍包括津助／合約和私營／自負盈虧安老院。

鑑於津助／合約院舍一般可提供更好的薪酬待遇吸引本地求職者，政府推出「特別計劃」時，規定這類院舍須採用較低的輸入護理員比例，即每聘請兩名全職本地員工才可申請輸入一名外地護理員（即2：1），而私營／自負盈虧院舍的適用比例則為1：1。至二○二五年六月底，社署向院舍業界共批出約8300個配額（包括續約配額），當中津助／合約院舍所佔的配額約兩成，而私營／自負盈虧院舍則佔近八成。此外，根據「特別計劃」的規定，僱主只可在未能招聘本地護理員的情況下申請輸入外地護理員。院舍業界普遍認為申請輸入護理員的門檻和實際成本不低。獲准輸入護理員的僱主須為輸入護理員提供住宿。輸入護理員如生病或受傷，無論是否因受僱而引致，僱主須提供免費醫療服務。如僱主為輸入護理員提供膳食，則必須是免費的。院舍亦須為每名輸入護理員每月繳付$400「僱員再培訓徵款」。

註一：根據統計處最新數字，二○二四年護理員每月中位工資為$15,120元（以最近的十位數顯示）。"

(7) as there are views pointing out that the median wage currently stipulated for imported care workers in RCHs under the Special Scheme is lower than the market level, and that the remuneration of local care workers employed by subvented RCHs is in general much higher than the median wage, resulting in less motivation for RCHs to employ local workers, whether the authorities will consider stipulating appropriate median wages for imported care workers in RCHs with different modes of operation, so as to enhance protection for local care workers concerned; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 To address the manpower shortage and new manpower demand in residential care homes (RCHs), and to assist the RCH sector in enhancing their service quality, the Government, on the premise of safeguarding the employment priority for local workers, launched the Special Scheme to Import Care Workers for RCHs (the Special Scheme) in June 2023 to allow residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs) and residential care homes for persons with disabilities (RCHDs) to import care workers on an appropriate scale. The Special Scheme set 7000 importation quotas when launched, including around 4000 care workers previously imported through the Supplementary Labour Scheme (SLS), and the relevant quotas were nearly exhausted by the first half of 2024. The Government, having reviewed the demand for and supply of care workers in the sector, announced in July of the same year that the quota ceiling would be adjusted to 15000 for RCHs to apply for by batches in the following three years.

 Our reply to the Member's questions, with consolidated information and data of the Social Welfare Department (SWD), Labour Department (LD) and Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), is as follows:

(1) to (3)The number of local and imported care workers employed by the RCHEs and the RCHDs in Hong Kong in the past three years are set out at Annex 1. The details of the first five rounds of applications and approval results under the Special Scheme are set out at Annex 2, with about 400 rejected cases mainly because the quotas available for that round of applications were exhausted, or the applications did not comply with the requirements of the Special Scheme. The sixth round of applications ended on May 6, 2025, and the SWD is processing the applications for around 500 new quotas.

 There are five staff members in the SWD designated to implement the Special Scheme, including the Social Work Officer grade, the Executive Officer grade and the Clerical grade. To safeguard job opportunities of local care workers, the SWD will conduct random checks on the ""Confirmation of Local Recruitment"" submitted by the RCHs that apply for joining the Special Scheme, with a view to ensuring that they have conducted local recruitment through channel(s) specified by the Director of Social Welfare but have been unsuccessful in filling the vacancies. Up to March 2025, the SWD has conducted random checks on about 300 local recruitment records of the RCHs, accounting for more than 10 per cent of the total number of applications, and found no case of RCH's intentionally or knowingly submitting inaccurate information. Nor has any RCH been imposed administrative sanction during that period of time.

(4) to (6)The LD's Labour Inspectors (LIs) inspect the workplaces of imported workers and the accommodation provided by employers in Hong Kong for imported workers. The establishment and strength of the LIs responsible for the above work is 37. In the past two years, LIs have carried out a total of 4407 inspections relating to imported care workers (including cases under the SLS/Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) and the Special Scheme), including 2298 workplace inspections and 2109 accommodation inspections. Should suspected deprivation of imported workers' rights and benefits be detected during inspection, the LD will promptly conduct follow-up investigation. Complaints received during the inspections are counted towards the overall number of complaint cases.

  Since the launch of the Special Scheme in June 2023 and up to May 2025, the LD and the SWD have received a total of 47 complaints against the RCHs suspected to have breached the law or the requirements of the Special Scheme. The complaints mainly involved wages (including wage rebates and underpayment of wages) and work arrangements. Among them, there were eight complaints received about the displacement of serving local care workers by imported care workers, of which the Government has completed investigation of seven cases and no irregularities were found. The remaining one case is still under investigation. During the same period, the LD successfully prosecuted an employer that had engaged imported care workers under the Special Scheme. The employer violated the Employees' Compensation Ordinance by failing to take out employees' compensation insurance policies and was fined $2,500 by the court. The SWD is examining the case concerned and will consider imposing administrative sanctions as appropriate.

  Since the launch of the Special Scheme, the number of complaint, prosecution and conviction cases per year are tabulated as follows:




Year 2023
			(since the launch of the Special Scheme in June)
Year 2024
Year 2025

(7) The Special Scheme requires that the salary of local care workers must not be lower than those offered to imported care workers, while the salary of imported care workers must not be lower than the latest median monthly wage of care workers (Note 1) as compiled by the C&SD. The median monthly wage of care workers are compiled based on the data obtained from C&SD's Annual Earnings and Hours Survey conducted between May and June. The C&SD has been compiling statistics on the median wages of various industries based on this approach over the years. In respect of the median wage of care workers at RCHs, institutions being sampled include subvented/contract and private/self-financing RCHEs.

  As subvented/contract RCHs can generally offer better remuneration packages to attract local job-seekers, the Government has stipulated that these types of RCHs should adopt a lower ratio of imported care workers when launching the Special Scheme. They are only allowed to, for every two full-time local staff employed, apply for importing one non-local care worker (i.e. 2:1) whereas private/self-financing RCHs can apply to import one non-local care worker for every full-time local employee (i.e. 1:1). Up to end June 2025, the SWD has approved a total of about 8 300 quotas (including contract renewal quotas) for the RCH sector, of which the quotas for subvented/contract RCHs accounted for about 20 per cent while those for private/self-financing RCHs accounted for nearly 80 per cent. In addition, under the Special Scheme, employers may only apply for importation of care workers if they are unable to recruit local care workers. The sector generally opined that the threshold and actual cost of applying to import care workers are not as low. Employers who are allowed to import care workers must provide accommodation for the imported care workers. If an imported care worker becomes ill or injured, regardless of whether that is work-related, his or her employer is required to offer free medical services. The meals for imported care workers, if so provided by an employer, must be free of charge. The RCHs also must pay a monthly ""Employee Retraining Levy"" of $400 per imported care worker. 

Note 1: According to the latest figure of C&SD, the median monthly wage of care workers in 2024 was $15,120 (rounding to the nearest tenth)."

立法會四題：釋放「銀色生產動力」,2025-07-09 12:30,2025-07-09 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900299.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上林振昇議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的答覆：

問題：

政府於今年五月公布各項促進銀髮經濟措施，有意見認為在釋放「銀色生產動力」方面，當局應推出更多措施協助基層長者解決就業困難和改善待遇。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於不少基層長者反映在目前輸入勞工政策下，僱主傾向聘用較年輕外勞，令長者的工作機會減少，特別是「補充勞工優化計劃」涵蓋的工種，政府會否考慮收緊該計劃，例如就所有工種設立配額上限，以提升長者就業機會；

（二）鑑於有年長求職者反映，即使符合職位要求，但有僱主表明因其年齡較大而拒絕聘請，當局會否積極研究立法，打擊職場年齡歧視；及

（三）政府於二○二三年建議提高僱主為65歲或以上僱員作強積金自願性供款的稅務扣減，鼓勵其為年長僱員供款以增加銀髮族的退休儲蓄，並在二○二四年《施政報告》提出將有關措施納入促進銀髮經濟工作組的工作內，有關措施的推展進度為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府推行一系列措施，協助求職人士就業。因應中高齡人士的就業需要，政府提供多元化的就業支援，以及推廣長者友善僱傭措施，鼓勵及協助他們重返或留任職場，釋放年長人士的勞動力。

勞工處於去年七月十五日推出為期三年的「再就業津貼試行計劃」，鼓勵連續三個月或以上沒有從事獲酬工作的40歲或以上人士，重投就業市場。每名合資格參加者連續完成12個月工作可獲發最高20,000元再就業津貼。計劃的反應十分理想。截至今年六月已錄得超過45000名參加者及接近23000宗就業個案，其中涉及60歲或以上的參加人數及就業個案數目約佔總數的四分之一。與上述計劃相輔相成，勞工處亦通過「中高齡就業計劃」下的培訓津貼鼓勵僱主聘請40歲或以上人士並提供培訓，讓中高齡人士提升工作技能。

就議員的提問，經諮詢財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）後，現答覆如下：

（一）在保障本地勞工優先就業的前提下，政府適度容許僱主申請輸入勞工，補充本港勞動力。勞工處自二○二三年九月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），暫停執行原有「補充勞工計劃」下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位一般不得輸入勞工的規定，為期兩年。

勞工處推行優化計劃時，致力保障本地勞工優先就業。優化計劃的申請僱主必須進行四星期本地招聘，以不低於當時市場相類職位的每月工資中位數，優先聘請合適的本地工人填補空缺。優化計劃規定，僱主在本地招聘期間經任何途徑招聘本地求職者，均不得提供遜於勞工處同意的聘用條件，亦不可向求職者附加任何年齡、性別等限制性要求。優化計劃亦規定僱主須持續符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例二比一的規定。同時，僱主不得以輸入勞工取代在職本地僱員。如需裁員，僱主應先裁減輸入勞工，保障本地工人的就業機會。

為進一步加強保障本地工人優先就業，勞工處已於六‍月十七日實施新措施，包括由當日起獲通過初步甄別並進行四星期本地招聘的優化計劃申請，勞工處會在「互動就業服務」網站刊登職位空缺資料時，展示申請公司的名稱，增加本地招聘的透明度，鼓勵求職人士應徵有關職位。

勞工處會檢討優化計劃的經驗與成效，包括計劃的涵蓋範圍、運作和實施安排；促進及確保本地工人（包括年長人士）優先就業的措施；保障輸入勞工權益的措施；以及其他有關計劃的規定及事項。政府在檢討過程中會充分考慮及平衡持份者的意見，從而擬定優化計劃及後的安排。

（二）政府致力消除任何歧視觀念或行為。在就業範疇，政府鼓勵僱主依據「不論年齡，唯才是用」的原則，按照合理和劃一的甄選準則評估應徵者或僱員的工作能力。根據政府統計處曾進行的統計結果顯示，絕大多數受訪者並不認為年齡是影響僱傭方面的重要因素，反映香港就業市場年齡歧視的問題並不顯著。

政府會繼續通過宣傳及推廣平等就業機會的信息，促進和保障平等就業機會，並加強培訓和再培訓，提高不同年齡人士的就業能力。

（三）鼓勵僱主為其65歲或以上的僱員作更多強制性公積金（強積金）自願性供款的稅務優惠建議，目的是鼓勵更多年長僱員在65歲後考慮繼續留在勞動市場，既可為經濟增長作出貢獻，又可增加退休儲蓄。鑑於有意見認為此單一措施的成效不大，建議與其他銀髮措施結合，以產生協同效應，就此，《行政長官2024年施政報告》提出將此項建議納入促進銀髮經濟工作組（工作組）的工作內。工作組經審視後，認為有關建議複雜化了強積金的政策目標，其就有關僱員領取自願性供款所設的限制亦令建議的效用存疑。就鼓勵長者加入勞動市場方面，工作組在今年五月二十七日公布的30項促進銀髮經濟的措施中，已提出多項有助釋放「銀色生產動力」的針對性措施，例如為後50人士推出優先培訓顧問諮詢服務、檢討「再就業津貼試行計劃」及「中高齡就業計劃」，以及加強推廣長者友善僱傭措施，政府認為應集中資源落實上述措施，以更聚焦和直接地促進年長人士就業。"
"LCQ4: Unleashing ""silver productivity""",2025-07-09 12:30,2025-07-09 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900300.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Lam Chun-sing and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

 In May this year, the Government announced various measures to promote the silver economy. There are views that in terms of unleashing ""silver productivity"", the authorities should introduce more measures to help grass-roots elderly to overcome employment difficulties and improve employment conditions. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as quite a number of grass-roots elderly persons have relayed that under the existing labour importation policies, employers tend to hire younger imported workers, resulting in fewer job opportunities for the elderly, particularly for the job categories covered by the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme, whether the Government will consider tightening such scheme, for example, by setting quota ceilings for all job categories, so as to enhance employment opportunities for the elderly;

(2) as some elderly job seekers have relayed that even if they met the job requirements, some employers explicitly indicated that they refused to hire them due to their advanced age, whether the authorities will actively study the enactment of legislation to combat age discrimination in the workplace; and

(3) given that the Government proposed in 2023 to increase tax deduction for Mandatory Provident Fund voluntary contributions made by employers for their employees aged 65 or above to encourage them to make contributions for mature employees, with a view to increasing the retirement savings of the silver-haired group, and proposed in the 2024 Policy Address to put the relevant measure under the work of the Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy, of the progress of taking forward the relevant measure?

Reply:

President,

 The Government has been implementing various measures to assist job seekers in securing employment. Taking account of the employment needs of older and middle-aged persons, the Government provides diversified employment support and promote elderly-friendly employment practices to encourage and assist them to re-enter or remain in the employment market, and to unleash the labour force of older persons.

 On July 15 last year, the Labour Department (LD) launched the three-year Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme to encourage persons aged 40 or above who have not been in paid work for three consecutive months or more to re-join the employment market. Each eligible participant who has worked for 12 months continuously will be provided with a re-employment allowance up to $20,000. Response to the Scheme is very favourable. As at June this year, over 45 000 participants and nearly 23 000 placements were recorded. About a quarter of the participants and placements are persons aged 60 or above. In tandem with the above Scheme, the LD, through the training subsidy of the Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged, encourages employers to hire persons aged 40 or above and provide them with training to uplift the work skills of older and middle-aged persons.

 In consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB), the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) On the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, the Government suitably allows employers to apply for importation of workers to replenish the labour force in Hong Kong. The LD has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023 to suspend the general exclusion of the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts from labour importation under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme for two years.

 When implementing the ESLS, the LD is committed to safeguarding employment priority for local workers. Applicant employers of the ESLS must undertake a four-week local recruitment exercise and give priority to employing suitable local workers to fill the vacancies at a salary not lower than the prevailing median monthly wage of a comparable position in the market. The ESLS requires that employers taking on local job seekers through any recruitment channels during the local recruitment period must not offer employment terms less favourable than those agreed by the LD, nor can they impose on job seekers any restrictive requirements such as age or gender. The ESLS also requires employers to meet the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers of 2:1 on a continuous basis. At the same time, employers shall not displace serving local workers with imported workers. To protect the employment opportunities of local workers, employers should retrench imported workers first in the event of redundancy.

 To further strengthen the protection of employment priority for local workers, the LD implemented new measures on June 17, including displaying the names of applicant companies on the Interactive Employment Service website when publishing the job vacancies in respect of the ESLS applications which pass the initial screening and commence the four-week local recruitment process after that date to increase the transparency of local recruitment and encourage job seekers to apply for relevant jobs.

The LD will review the experience and effectiveness of the ESLS, including the Scheme's coverage, operation and implementation arrangements, measures to promote and ensure employment priority for local workers (including older persons), measures to protect the rights and benefits of imported workers, as well as other requirements and matters relating to the ESLS. The Government will take full account of and balance the views of stakeholders during the review when mapping out the future arrangements of the ESLS.

(2) The Government is committed to eliminating all forms of discriminatory ideas and behaviours. In the realm of employment, the Government encourages employers to adopt the principle of ""Count on Talent, Not Age in Employment"" when assessing the abilities of candidates or employees, and use reasonable and standardised selection criteria. According to the results of a survey conducted by the Census and Statistics Department, the vast majority of respondents did not view age as an important factor affecting employment, reflecting that age discrimination is not a major problem in Hong Kong's employment market.

 The Government will continue to promote and uphold equal employment opportunities by disseminating and advocating the message of fairness in employment, as well as strengthening training and retraining to enhance the employability of individuals across all age groups.

(3) The proposed tax initiative to employers to make more Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) voluntary contributions for their employees aged 65 or above aims to encourage more mature employees to consider staying in the labour force and continue to contribute to economic growth after reaching age 65 while increasing their retirement savings. Given that there were views on the limited effect for this standalone measure and recommendations that this measure should be combined with the other initiatives on silver economy for creating synergy, the Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address announced that this proposal would be included in the work of the Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy (Working Group). Upon review, the Working Group considered that the proposal has complicated the policy objective of MPF, and the restriction on employees receiving voluntary contributions also casts doubt on the effectiveness of the proposal. In terms of encouraging the elderly to join the labour force, the Working Group has already rolled out various targeted measures to help unleash ""silver productivity"" as part of the 30 measures for promoting silver economy announced on May 27 this year, such as accord priority to post-50s for receiving training consultation service, reviewing the Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme and Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged, and stepping up the promotion of elderly-friendly employment practices. The Government considers that resources should be concentrated on the aforementioned measures to promote employment of older persons in a more focused and direct manner."
立法會二十一題：保障本地勞工就業,2025-07-09 12:20,2025-07-09 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900312.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上陸頌雄議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

根據行業輸入勞工計劃及補充勞工優化計劃（「優化計劃」）的一般規定，僱主須符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工的人手比例為二比一（該人手比例），而優化計劃亦規定僱主必須先進行四星期本地招聘，優先聘請合適的本地工人填補空缺。但有工友反映，有僱主利用相關政策漏洞，在向勞工處提交輸入勞工申請後，解僱本地勞工或將他們由全職轉為兼職，更有部分僱主無意招聘本地勞工。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府於上月十八日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，僱主在完成四星期本地招聘程序後，勞工處會聯繫每名不獲聘用的本地求職者，評估僱主是否有誠意聘用本地工人，自優化計劃推出至今，勞工處聯繫不獲聘用的本地工人的次數和相關僱主拒絕聘用他們的理由為何；勞工處以何標準評估僱主拒絕招聘的理由是否合理；

（二）會否主動調查僱主有否向本地求職者提出「過分要求」（即招聘門檻過高及工作量大但薪酬偏低等）；如會，勞工處已進行的調查次數和跟進措施為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）有何機制監察僱主有否嚴格執行四星期本地招聘的規定；會否要求僱主在申請優化計劃前，必須將該等職位空缺資料刊登至勞工處「互動就業服務」網站，並至少保留四星期；

（四）二○二三年至今，勞工處（i）因僱主所提交的資料未符合該人手比例而拒絕輸入勞工申請的宗數，以及（ii）接獲懷疑僱主未有持續遵從該人手比例的投訴宗數、跟進情況和相應罰則分別為何；

（五）二○二三年至今，勞工處以（a）突擊和（b）非突擊方式（i）巡查有輸入勞工的工作場地次數，及（ii）發現並就違反該人手比例規定作出跟進的個案宗數，並以下表列出分項數字；及

（六）有何措施打擊各輸入勞工計劃下的違規行為，以防止輸入勞工政策被濫用；會否要求僱主在其輸入勞工申請獲批後，每月須向勞工處匯報其本地僱員與輸入勞工的人數、名字、工時及工資等資料，如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

為應對人力短缺帶來的挑戰，在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，政府已加強輸入勞工的機制。除為建造業、運輸業，以及安老院和殘疾人士院舍推出行業輸入勞工計劃外，勞工處自二○二三年九月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），暫停執行原有「補充勞工計劃」下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位一般不得輸入勞工的規定，為期兩年。

就議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）為保障本地勞工優先就業，優化計劃的申請僱主必須先進行四星期本地公開招聘，以不低於市場相類職位的每月工資中位數，優先聘請合資格的本地工人填補空缺。僱主完成本地招聘程序後，勞工處會聯繫每名不獲僱主聘用的本地求職者，了解面試詳情，並確定僱主匯報不聘用的原因是否與事實相符及合理，從而評估僱主是否有誠意聘用本地工人。最常見不獲聘用的原因為求職者未達入職要求，例如沒有相關工作技能及缺乏相關經驗。視乎情況，勞工處會多次聯繫每名不獲聘用的求職者，跟進面試的結果。

（二）及（三）勞工處嚴謹處理每宗優化計劃的申請，為每個申請職位進行初步甄別，審視職位空缺的聘用條件，包括職責範圍、入職和學歷要求、工作地點、每月薪酬及工作時數等，確保僱主擬提供的薪金達到每月中位工資及招聘條件合理。

通過初步甄別後，僱主須以勞工處同意的招聘條件就申請職位進行四星期本地招聘，其間勞工處會在「互動就業服務」網站刊登職位空缺資料，為有關空缺進行就業選配，並將空缺資料發布給勞工顧問委員會委員、相關職工會及培訓機構，以便他們轉介合適的本地求職人士應徵。僱主須同時在本地報章或其他招聘平台刊登招聘廣告，優化計劃規定，僱主在本地招聘期間經任何途徑招聘本地求職者，均不得提供遜於勞工處同意的聘用條件，亦不可向求職者提出任何年齡、性別等限制性要求或其他未獲勞工處同意的入職要求。

僱主完成本地招聘程序後，須向勞工處匯報結果並遞交招聘廣告作核對。勞工處會聯繫每名不獲聘用的本地求職者，了解面試詳情。如有證據顯示僱主違反本地招聘的規定，或無合理理由拒絕聘用合資格的本地求職者，勞工處會中止處理有關申請。勞工處亦會向僱主施加行政制裁，拒絕處理他們在隨後一年提交的其他申請。

（四）優化計劃規定僱主須持續符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例二比一的規定（人手比例規定）。全職僱員是指僱主直接僱用而每周總工作時數不少於35小時以經營相關業務的本地僱員，不包括兼職僱員、向僱主提供服務的外判商員工或自僱人士。二○二三年九月四日至二○二五年六月，勞工處拒絕29宗涉及未符合人手比例規定的輸入勞工申請。此外，每宗申請獲批的輸入勞工數目亦須符合上述的人手比例。

二○二三年九月四日至二○二五年四月期間，勞工處沒有收到有關僱主不符合人手比例規定的投訴，而二○二五年五月至六月期間則收到31宗這類投訴，勞工處正進行調查，包括巡查輸入勞工的工作地點及查核有關的僱傭紀錄。如證實僱主違反規定，會施加行政制裁，拒絕處理僱主在隨後一年提交的其他申請。

（五）及（六）二○二三年、二○二四年及二○二五年一至五月，勞工處的勞工督察分別到輸入勞工的工作地點及僱主在香港為輸入勞工提供的居所進行5695 次、5417次及2873次巡查，保障輸入勞工的僱傭權益。勞工處不會在巡查工作場所前預先通知有關場所的負責人。

由今年六月十七日起，勞工處實施一系列加強保障本地工人優先就業的新措施，包括在優化計劃專題網頁新增網上投訴表格，方便本地僱員及輸入勞工就僱主涉嫌違反優化計劃的規定作出投訴；在「互動就業服務」網站刊登優化計劃本地招聘的職位空缺資料時，展示申請公司名稱；進行特別巡查行動，到聘用輸入勞工的企業查核僱主有否持續符合人手比例規定；以及按違規風險，要求僱主申報全職本地僱員及輸入勞工的資料和相關人手比例。

為保障本地工人的就業機會，優化計劃規定僱主不得以輸入勞工取代在職的本地僱員，並須持續符合人手比例規定。如需裁員，僱主應先裁減輸入勞工。如證實僱主違反優化計劃的規定，勞工處會作出行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准、拒絕處理僱主其後的輸入勞工申請（禁制期最長兩年）等。"

Question:

It has been reported that serious congestion occurred at various land boundary control points (BCPs) in Hong Kong on June 21 and 22 this year, and crowd management measures had to be implemented at the Heung Yuen Wai/Liantang Control Point, the Shenzhen Bay Port and the Hong Kong Port of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. On the night of June 22, Hong Kong vehicles travelling under the ""Quota-free Scheme for Hong Kong Private Cars Travelling to Guangdong via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge"" (""Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles"" Scheme) even caused serious congestion on the Zhuhai Highway when they returned to Hong Kong. In addition, there are views that some vehicles under ""Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles"" Scheme have not travelled according to the reserved time slot, thus affecting the clearance efficiency at BCPs. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has reviewed the main reasons for the serious congestion at land BCPs during the aforesaid period (e.g. whether it was related to factors such as the end of the examination seasons of primary and secondary schools, the improvement of the weather or activities organised by shopping malls in Shenzhen); whether the Government has put in place an inter-departmental joint early warning mechanism which incorporates school calendars and daily schedules of schools in general, weather forecasts as well as information on commercial activities in Shenzhen, so as to make advance assessments and forecasts on the passenger flow at BCPs; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as it has been reported that during the aforesaid period when crowd management was implemented at the Heung Yuen Wai/Liantang Control Point and when there were the peak hours for people returning to Hong Kong at the Shenzhen Bay Port, the authorities did not issue real-time alerts through official channels, whether the Government has reviewed the existing information dissemination mechanism; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) in order to avoid the aforesaid similar serious congestion in the future, whether the Government will consider implementing new measures, such as formulating temporary crowd management plans or deploying additional BCP personnel to enhance clearance efficiency; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) of the number of vehicle owners who have been penalised since the implementation of the ""Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles"" Scheme for failing to travel according to the reserved time slot or failing to make a reservation (set out by penalty measure, including refusing to allow their vehicles to travel to Guangdong Province, suspending their eligibility for making another reservation and revoking the relevant licences issued to them); whether the authorities have reviewed the effectiveness of the existing penalty mechanism, and whether they will consider adjusting the mechanism to further ensure that vehicles under the ""Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles"" Scheme will travel according to the reserved time slot?

President,

In consultation with the Transport and Logistics Bureau, a reply to the questions raised by the Hon Rock Chen is as follows:

(1) With the increasing co-operation between the Mainland and Hong Kong, exchanges at the community level have also intensified. We are pleased to learn that many Hong Kong residents like travelling to the Mainland during weekends or long public holidays, and are glad to learn that the number of Mainland visitors to Hong Kong is on an upward trend. The two-way travel between residents of the Mainland and Hong Kong has also brought economic benefits to both places.

During the weekend of June 21 and 22 this year, around 569 000 outbound passenger trips (Saturday) and around 586 000 inbound passenger trips (Sunday) were recorded at various land boundary control points (BCPs), of which about 80 per cent were Hong Kong residents, representing an increase of about 22 per cent and 18 per cent compared with the average numbers of outbound and inbound passenger trips during normal weekends this year.

Northbound travel has become a weekend routine for Hong Kong residents. Since travelling is very convenient and there is no need for advance planning, residents can make impromptu trips for different reasons, such as weather conditions on the day or individual preference. The reasons for the relatively higher numbers of inbound and outbound passenger trips in the aforementioned weekend as compared with normal weekends may include the end of the school examination season and improved weather conditions during the weekend.

The peak hours for outbound and inbound passenger traffic were from 9am to 3pm on Saturday, and from 4pm to midnight on Sunday, which are similar to the northbound travel pattern of Hong Kong residents at normal weekends. As for the vehicular flow, the number of outbound trips for private cars via the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge (HZMB) on Saturday was 9 662, among which those under the ""Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles"" Scheme (the Northbound Travel Scheme) accounted for 68 per cent, while the number of inbound trips on Sunday was 9 432, which was about 25 per cent higher than the numbers of outbound and inbound trips at normal weekends this year.

It is noted that the waiting time during the peak hours of cross-boundary traffic at the HZMB Hong Kong Port and Heung Yuen Wai (HYW) BCP was longer than usual. Relevant departments at various BCPs, including the Immigration Department (ImmD), the Customs and Excise Department, the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Transport Department (TD), etc. have put in place an inter-departmental co-operation mechanism to monitor the real-time situations at BCPs during different festive occasions and mega events. In view of the heavy traffic at the BCPs over the aforementioned weekend, relevant departments had immediately activated the contingency mechanism. Through close co-ordination and flexible deployment of manpower, operation of additional clearance counters and kiosks, and implementation of appropriate crowd control and traffic diversion measures to maintain order at the BCPs, congestion was alleviated in an orderly manner.

The TD has always maintained close liaison with local and cross-boundary public transport operators, and would co-ordinate with them to flexibly adjust the frequency of public transport services connecting each BCP during peak cross-boundary travel periods in order to meet the travel needs. During the above-mentioned weekend, public transport operators closely monitored changes in the number of passengers, increased the service frequency during periods of particularly high passenger demand, as well as deployed additional staff to assist passengers and maintain order at the stations, with a view to expediting the dispersal of passengers.

(2) The Government has disseminated information through various official and unofficial channels, including radio broadcasts, websites, and online media such as social media platforms, to assist residents and passengers in planning ahead and avoid making their journeys during busy periods as far as possible. Passengers may visit the ImmD's website to check the estimated waiting time of each BCP, and the TD's ""HKeMobility"" mobile application or the TD's website (hkemobility.gov.hk/en/traffic-information/live/cctv) to access the snapshots of traffic conditions at outbound and inbound vehicle clearance plazas of the HZMB Hong Kong Port. They may also browse the relevant websites and mini programmes, etc. of the Shenzhen and Zhuhai authorities to know more about the clearance status of BCPs in the Mainland.

The HKPF will continue to monitor the real-time situations at various BCPs and disseminate the latest information to the public timely through the media or social media in the event of serious congestion at individual BCP, including appealing to the public to adjust their itineraries (e.g. switching to other modes of transport or using other BCPs for boundary crossing) in order to ease passenger and vehicular flows.

Moreover, the TD's Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre operates 24 hours a day to closely monitor traffic conditions and public transport services in different areas of Hong Kong, including various BCPs and major stations, and will disseminate the latest traffic information through various channels. Members of the public can check the latest traffic news released by radio, television, and the ""HKeMobility"".

(3) Northbound travel over weekends has become a norm for Hong Kong residents, and the two-way travel between the Mainland and Hong Kong is also a future trend. We therefore need to get well-prepared, and enhance the responsiveness of relevant departments as well as the level of clearance facilitation at the BCPs in order to cope with the increasing demand for clearance services.

The departments at the BCPs will enhance the co-operation mechanism, constantly monitor the real-time situations at various BCPs, and maintain close liaison with the Mainland port authorities through the established port hotlines and real-time notification mechanisms to ensure smooth operation of the BCPs.

With respect to the traffic and vehicular flow at the HZMB Hong Kong Port, the HKPF will, depending on the circumstances, deploy additional police officers to the major roads of the port for on-the-spot observation of traffic conditions, and remind drivers to comply with road markings and drive with care, with a view to ensuring road safety and smooth traffic. When the vehicles enter the clearance plaza and its maximum capacity is reached, the HKPF will also implement traffic control measures in a timely manner to maintain order on the spot.

In addition, to further increase the handling capacity of the HYW BCP, enhancement works are being carried out at its passenger departure hall. Upon completion of the works, the total number of e-Channels in the passenger departure hall will be increased from 14 to 18. As some of its traditional counters have to be closed temporarily in the course of the enhancement works, the ImmD has flexibly deployed resources to set up four temporary counters in the passenger departure hall to minimise the impact of the enhancement works. We will also explore the possibility of further increasing the number of e-Channels.

As stated above, the two-way travel between residents of the Mainland and Hong Kong is a future trend. We need to enhance the handling capacity of BCPs in order to meet the increasing passenger traffic. In particular, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is collaborating with the Shenzhen Municipal Government to press ahead with the redevelopment project of the Huanggang Port in full steam. The redeveloped new Huanggang Port will implement the co-location arrangement and the ""collaborative inspection and joint clearance"" mode to provide greater convenience for cross-boundary passengers. The new Huanggang Port will be equipped with 134 ""collaborative inspection"" automated channels and 68 traditional manual counters, representing a significant increase compared to 39 traditional e-channels and 45 traditional manual counters currently available at the Lok Ma Chau (LMC) Control Point. Its design flow is about 200 000 passenger trips per day. Compared to the LMC Control Point which now serves a daily average of about 37 000 passenger trips, it is believed that the redeveloped new Huanggang Port can meet the future demand for clearance services between the two places.

(4) As stipulated in the terms and conditions of ""the Northbound Travel Scheme"", if any participants violate the travel arrangements (including travelling without booking in advance or not travelling within the specified period), the relevant departments of the Guangdong and Hong Kong governments may refuse to allow relevant vehicles to travel to Guangdong Province via the HZMB, and may suspend their travel booking eligibility, or even revoke the relevant permits. At present, the TD regularly shares the booking information on ""the Northbound Travel Scheme"" with relevant departments at the Hong Kong Port to facilitate their daily operations at the HZMB Hong Kong Port. The TD has also been maintaining close liaison with the relevant Mainland authorities, and conducting spot checks on the cross-boundary records of vehicles under ""the Northbound Travel Scheme"", with a view to reviewing the situation of compliance with the terms and conditions."
LCQ21: Safeguarding employment of local workers,2025-07-09 12:20,2025-07-09 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900324.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Luk Chung-hung and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

  According to the general requirements of the sector-specific labour importation schemes and the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS), employers shall fulfil a manning ratio of 2:1 for full-time local employees to imported workers (the manning ratio), and the ESLS also requires applicant employers to undertake a four-week local recruitment exercise and accord priority to employing suitable local workers to fill the job vacancies. However, some workers have reflected that some employers have taken advantage of the loopholes in the relevant policies to dismiss local workers or switch them from full-time to part-time after submitting their labour importation applications to the Labour Department (LD), and some employers even have no intention of recruiting local workers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that in the reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on 18th of last month, the Government indicated that upon completion of the four-week local recruitment procedures, the LD would contact each of the local job seekers who was not employed by the employers and assess whether the employers are genuinely committed to recruiting local workers, of the number of contacts made by the LD with job seekers who were not employed since the launch of the ESLS, and the reasons for the relevant employers' refusal to employ them; the criteria adopted by the LD for assessing the validity of the employer's reasons for refusal to recruit;

(2) whether it has taken the initiative to investigate if employers have made ""excessive demands"" on local job seekers (i.e. excessively high recruitment thresholds and heavy workload but relatively low salary, etc); if so, of the number of investigations conducted by the LD and the follow-up actions taken; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) of the mechanism in place to monitor whether employers have strictly adhered to the requirement for conducing four-week local recruitment; whether employers will be required to, before applying for the ESLS, publish the job vacancies on the LD's Interactive Employment Service website and retain for at least four weeks;

(4) since 2023, (i) of the number of labour importation applications rejected by the LD due to the failure of the information submitted by the employers to meet the manning ratio; and (ii) of the number of complaints received by the LD regarding employers allegedly failing to continuously meet the manning ratio, the follow-up actions and the corresponding penalties;

(5) since 2023, of the respective numbers of (a) surprise and (b) non-surprise inspections conducted by the LD (i) at workplaces with imported workers, and (ii) cases detected and follow-up actions taken in respect of non-compliance with the manning ratio requirement, with a breakdown as set out in the table below; and

(6) of the measures in place to combat the non-compliant acts under various labour importation schemes in order to prevent abuse of the labour importation policy; whether employers will be required to report to the LD the number, name, working hour, wage and so on of their local employees and imported workers on a monthly basis after their labour importation applications have been approved; if so, of the details; if not, not reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  To cope with the challenges brought by manpower shortage and on the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, the Government has enhanced the mechanism for importation of labour. Apart from launching sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction sector, transport sector, and residential care homes for the elderly and residential care homes for persons with disabilities, the Labour Department (LD) has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023, to suspend the general exclusion of the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts from labour importation under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme for two years.

  The reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) To safeguard the employment priority for local workers, applicant employers of the ESLS must undertake a four-week local open recruitment and accord priority to employing qualified local workers to fill the vacancies at a salary not lower than the prevailing median monthly wage of a comparable position in the market. Upon employers' completion of the local recruitment procedures, the LD will contact each of the unsuccessful local job seekers to verify the interview details and confirm if the reasons for not employing the job seekers as reported by the employers are consistent with the facts and reasonable, so as to assess whether the employers have sincerity in recruiting local workers. The most common reason for job seekers not being employed is failing to meet the entry requirements, such as not having relevant work skills and lacking relevant experience. Depending on the circumstances, the LD will contact each unsuccessful job seeker several times to follow up on the interview results.

(2) and (3) The LD stringently processes each application under the ESLS, and conducts initial screening for each applied post and reviews the employment terms, including the scope of duties, entry and academic requirements, work locations, monthly salary and hours of work, to ensure that the salary offered by an employer meets the median monthly wage and the recruitment terms are reasonable.

  After passing the initial screening, employers shall adopt the recruitment terms as agreed by the LD and undergo four-week local recruitment. During this period, the LD will publish the job vacancies on the Interactive Employment Service website, conduct job matching for relevant vacancies and disseminate the vacancy information to members of the Labour Advisory Board, relevant trade unions and training institutions to facilitate their referrals of suitable local job seekers for application. Employers shall in parallel place recruitment advertisements in local newspaper(s) or on other recruitment platform(s). The ESLS requires that employers taking on local job seekers through any recruitment channels during the local recruitment period must not offer employment terms less favourable than those agreed by the LD, nor can they impose on job seekers any restrictive requirements such as age or gender, or other entry requirements not approved by the LD.

  Upon completion of the local recruitment procedures, employers shall report the results and submit the recruitment advertisements to the LD for verification. The LD will contact each of the local job seekers who is not employed to verify the interview details. If there is evidence showing that an employer has violated the requirements of local recruitment or refused to employ qualified local job seekers without reasonable grounds, the LD will terminate the processing of the relevant application. The LD will also impose administrative sanction on the employer and refuse to process any other application(s) submitted by the concerned employer in the following year.

(4) The ESLS requires relevant employers to meet the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers of 2:1 (manning ratio requirement) on a continuous basis. Full-time employees refer to local employees who are directly employed by an employer and work not less than 35 hours per week for operating the relevant business, excluding part-time staff, staff of subcontractors or self-employed persons providing services to the employer. From September 4, 2023, to June 2025, the LD refused 29 applications for labour importation that failed to meet the manning ratio requirement. In addition, the number of imported workers approved for each application must also comply with the manning ratio mentioned above.

  From September 4, 2023, to April 2025, the LD did not receive any complaint against employers for non-compliance with the manning ratio requirement. As for the 31 related complaints received between May and June 2025, the LD is conducting investigation, including inspecting the workplaces of imported workers and verifying relevant employment records. If violation of the requirement is substantiated, the LD will impose administrative sanction and refuse to process other application(s) submitted by the employer in the following year.

(5) and (6) In 2023, 2024 and from January to May 2025, Labour Inspectors of the LD conducted 5 695, 5 417 and 2 873 inspections respectively to workplaces of imported workers and imported workers' accommodation provided by employers in Hong Kong to protect the employment rights of imported workers. The LD will not give prior notice to the responsible persons of relevant premises before conducting workplace inspections.

  Since June 17 this year, the LD has implemented a series of new measures to strengthen the protection of the employment priority for local workers, including launching an online complaint form on the ESLS dedicated webpage to enable local employees and imported workers to lodge complaints against employers for suspected breaches of the requirements of the ESLS, displaying the names of applicant companies when publishing job vacancies on the Interactive Employment Service website, launching a special inspection campaign to check whether establishments employing imported workers have continuously met the manning ratio requirement, and requiring employers to report information on full-time local employees and imported workers as well as the relevant manning ratios based on a risk-based approach.

  To safeguard the employment priority for local workers, the ESLS requires employers not to displace local workers with imported workers and meet the manning ratio requirement on a continuous basis. In the event of redundancy, imported workers should be retrenched first. If there is evidence substantiating violation of the requirement of the ESLS, the LD will impose administrative sanction on the employers, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of labour previously granted and refusal to process other applications submitted by the employers (debarment period up to two years), etc."
立法會二十題：提升通關效率,2025-07-09 12:20,2025-07-09 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900358.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上陳仲尼議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

據報本年六月二十一日及二十二日期間，本港各陸路口岸出現嚴重擠塞，香園圍／蓮塘口岸、深圳灣口岸及港珠澳大橋香港口岸須實施人潮管制措施，而六月二十二日晚透過「港珠澳大橋港車北上不設配額計劃」（「港車北上」計劃）出行的港車回港時更造成珠海公路嚴重擠塞。此外，有意見認為「港車北上」計劃部分車輛未有按照預約時段出行，影響口岸的通關效率。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否檢視上述期間陸路口岸嚴重擠塞的主要原因為何（例如是否與中小學考試季節完結、天氣轉好或有深圳商場舉辦活動等因素有關）；政府有否設立跨部門聯合預警機制，結合一般學校的校曆和日程、天氣預報及深圳商業活動資訊，提前評估及預測口岸人流；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）據報上述期間香園圍／蓮塘口岸實施人潮管制及深圳灣口岸出現回港人潮高峰時，當局並無透過官方渠道發布實時提示，政府有否檢討現有的資訊發布機制；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）為避免日後發生上述同類的嚴重擠塞情況，政府會否考慮推行新措施，例如制訂臨時人流管制方案或增加口岸人員配置，以提升通關效率；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（四）自「港車北上」計劃實施以來，有多少名車主因未按預約時段出行或未有預約而被處罰（按處罰措施（包括拒絕讓車輛前往廣東省、暫停預約出行資格及撤銷獲發的相關牌證）列出）；當局有否檢討現行處罰機制的成效，以及會否考慮調整該機制以進一步確保「港車北上」計劃車輛按時出行？

答覆：

主席：

就陳仲尼議員的提問，經諮詢運輸及物流局後，現回覆如下：

（一）隨着內地與香港合作日益頻繁，民間交流也更見緊密。我們樂見不少港人喜歡在周末或長假期期間到內地旅遊，也喜聞內地訪港旅客人數呈上升趨勢，內地與香港人民的雙向奔赴亦帶動兩地經濟效益。

​今年六月二十一日及二十二日的周末，在各陸路口岸錄得約569 000出境人次（星期六）和約586 000入境人次（星期日），當中約八成為港人，與今年一般周末的平均出境人次及入境人次相比分別多約22%及18%。

港人周末北上已成習慣，加上出行十分便利，亦無須預先計劃行程，市民可因應不同原因，以及視乎當日天氣或個人喜好即興出行。上述周末出入境人數較一般周末為多，估計原因包括可能與學校考試季節完結及周末天氣轉好有關。

出境及入境的繁忙時段分別為星期六上午九時至下午三時，以及星期日下午四時至午夜十二時，與一般周末港人北上的出行習慣相若。至於車流方面，星期六經港珠澳大橋出境的私家車車次為9 662，當中「港車北上」佔68%，而於星期日回港的車次則為9 432，與今年一般周末的出入境車次相比多約25%。

我們留意到港珠澳大橋香港口岸及香園圍管制站在出入境最繁忙的數小時期間，輪候時間較一般長。各口岸相關部門包括入境事務處（入境處）、香港海關、警務處及運輸署等，已備有跨部門合作機制，就不同節日及大型活動，實時監察口岸情況。因應上述周末的口岸繁忙情況，口岸部門已即時啓動應變機制，透過緊密協調，靈活調配人手，加開檢查櫃枱和通道，並採取適當人流管控及交通疏導措施，以維持口岸秩序，讓擠塞情況得以有序疏導。

運輸署一向與本地和跨境公共運輸服務營辦商保持緊密聯繫，並會協調營辦商因應過境高峰期而彈性調整連接各陸路口岸的公共交通服務班次，以應付期間的交通需求。在上述周末，各公共交通營辦商一直密切留意口岸繁忙時段的旅客數量的變化，在乘客需求特別殷切的時段加密班次，並已加派人手協助乘客和維持車站秩序，以加快疏導旅客。

（二）政府已透過不同官方及非官方的渠道，包括電台廣播、網頁及社交平台等線上媒體發布資訊，協助市民及旅客預早計劃行程，盡量避免在繁忙時間過關。其中，市民可瀏覽入境處網頁，查看各邊境管制站的估計輪候過關狀況，以及運輸署的流動應用程式「香港出行易」，或運輸署網頁 （hkemobility.gov.hk/tc/traffic-information/live/cctv），查閱大橋香港口岸出境及入境客車通關廣場的交通快拍。市民亦可以瀏覽深圳和珠海當局相關網頁和小程式等，同時了解內地方的口岸通關狀態。

警方會繼續實時監察各口岸，在個別口岸出現嚴重擠塞的時候，適時透過媒體或社交媒體向市民發布最新信息，包括呼籲市民更改行程（如轉乘其他交通公具或經其他口岸出入境等），以疏導人流車流。

此外，運輸署的緊急事故交通協調中心每日24小時運作，密切監察全港各區，包括各口岸及主要車站的交通情況及公共運輸服務，並透過不同渠道發放最新交通資訊。市民可留意電台、電視台及「香港出行易」發放的最新交通消息。

（三）港人周末北上已成常態，而內地與香港人民的雙向奔赴亦是未來趨勢，因此我們需要作好準備，提升口岸部門的應對能力及口岸通關便利化水平，以應對不斷上升的通關需求。

口岸部門會強化合作機制，時刻監察各管制站的實時情況，與內地口岸部門透過已建立的口岸熱線及即時通報機制保持緊密聯繫，確保口岸運作暢通。

就有關港珠澳大橋香港口岸的交通及車流，警方會因應情況加派警員到口岸主要幹道實地觀察交通情況，提醒駕駛者遵守道路標記、小心駕駛，確保行車安全及道路暢通。當車輛駛至通關廣場並出現飽和情況時，警方亦會適時實施交通管制措施，以維持現場秩序。

此外，為進一步提升香園圍管制站的通關能力，管制站離境大堂正進行優化工程，工程完成後離境大堂的e-道會由原來的14條增加至18條。優化工程期間，離境大堂部分櫃枱需暫停使用，入境處因此靈活調配資源，於離境大堂增設四個臨時櫃枱，務求將優化工程的影響減至最低。我們會研究進一步增加e-道數目。

正如前文所述，內地與香港人民的雙向奔赴是未來趨勢，我們需要提升口岸通關能力，以應對持續增長的旅客流量。其中，特區政府正與深圳市政府全力推進皇崗口岸重建項目。重建後的新皇崗口岸會採用「一地兩檢」安排及「合作查驗、一次放行」通關模式，為跨境旅客提供更大便利。新皇崗口岸將設置134條「合作查驗」自助通道及68個傳統人工櫃枱，較現時落馬洲口岸的39條傳統e-道及45個傳統人工櫃枱配置大為提升，其設計通關流量約為每日20萬人次。對比現時每天平均約37 000人次進出的落馬洲口岸，重建後的新皇崗口岸相信可應付兩地未來的通關需求。

（四）「港車北上」的申請條款及條件中列明，如有關參加者違反出行安排（包括沒有事先預約或未有在指定時間內出行），粵港政府相關部門可拒絕讓有關車輛經大橋前往廣東省，並可能暫停其預約出行的資格，甚或撤銷其獲發的相關牌證。現時，運輸署定期把「港車北上」預約出行的資料傳送予口岸部門，以配合部門於大橋香港口岸的日常工作。運輸署亦一直與內地相關部門保持緊密聯繫，不時抽查「港車北上」車輛的過境紀錄以檢視遵守條款及條件的情況。"
立法會八題：按揭保險計劃下批准物業出租的安排,2025-07-09 12:15,2025-07-09 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070800728.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上龍漢標議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

為協助按揭保險計劃（按保計劃）下的業主應付因個人或家庭處境轉變帶來的特別需要，香港按證保險有限公司（按證保險公司）於去年八月宣布一項新安排，合資格業主可按個別情況獲豁免按保計劃下的業主自住要求，並獲批准申請將物業出租，惟須符合下述三項條件之一：（i）業主家庭將有新生嬰兒或領養兒童，導致住屋要求改變；（ii）業主失業，因而需要更具彈性的住屋或財務安排；或（iii）業主有其他特別需要出租物業，而本身在相關物業已自住最少12個月。此外，申請獲得批准的業主須承諾在豁免生效期間，業主及其同為按保計劃下債務人的配偶或同居伴侶不會在香港購入其他住宅物業。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉按證保險公司分別根據條件（i）、（ii）及（iii）接獲及批准了多少宗豁免業主自住要求的申請；及

（二）會否考慮優化現行安排，進一步協助按保計劃下有意另覓居所的業主，豁免他們在香港購入其他住宅物業的限制，為期最多12個月，讓他們在購入新物業後，有時間處理按保計劃下的物業；如否，原因為何

答覆：

主席：

按揭保險計劃（按保計劃）由香港按證保險有限公司﹙按證保險公司）經營，以協助市民在香港安居置業。按證保險公司於二○二四年八月在按保計劃下設立新安排，按個別情況考慮批准合資格業主將自住的物業出租，以協助他們應付因個人或家庭處境轉變帶來的特別需要（新安排）。

就問題的兩個部分，經諮詢按證保險公司後，現回覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年六月底，按證保險公司就新安排共收到約1 800宗申請。當中共有1 697宗申請獲批，其餘申請為不符合申請條件而被拒絕的個案或正在處理的申請。獲批申請的分類如下：




申請原因
宗數


業主家庭將有新生嬰兒或領養兒童，導致住屋要求改變
336
			（20%）


業主失業，因而需要更具彈性的住屋或財務安排
41
			（2%）


業主有其他特別需要出租物業，而本身在相關物業已自住最少12個月
1 320
			（78%）


總數
1 697
			（100%）




（二）由於按保計劃旨在促進市民安居置業，業主自住要求仍然是該計劃的主要合資格準則。新安排屬特殊措施，以協助有特別需要人士。事實上，按保計劃本質上屬保險產品，信貸風險仍是其主要考慮因素之一。如果在按保計劃下允許獲准出租物業的業主在未出售原有物業的情況下購入其他住宅物業，相關業主很可能需要在原有的高成數按揭貸款之外承擔更多融資負債。這將會為按保計劃帶來額外的信貸風險。

新安排推行接近一年，運作暢順，並為有特別需要的業主提供實質協助。按證保險公司暫無計劃調整新安排，未來會不時根據市場情況檢視按保計劃。"
LCQ8: Arrangement for approving property lettings under Mortgage Insurance Programme,2025-07-09 12:15,2025-07-09 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070800733.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Louis Loong and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

 In order to help homeowners under the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) meet their special needs arising from changes in personal or family circumstances, the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMC) announced in August last year a new arrangement, in which a waiver of the owner occupancy requirement under MIP will be granted, on a case-by-case basis, to an eligible homeowner applying for renting out the property subject to the fulfilment of one of the following three conditions: (i) the homeowner's family is expecting newborn(s) or adopting child(ren), resulting in a change in housing needs; (ii) the homeowner has become unemployed and requires more flexible housing or financial arrangements; or (iii) the homeowner has other special needs to rent out the property, and has been residing in the relevant property for not less than 12 months. In addition, homeowners whose applications are approved will be subject to undertakings that so long as the waiver is in effect, they or their spouses or cohabitants who are also obligors under the MIP should not purchase any additional residential properties in Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the respective numbers of applications received and approved for waiver of the owner occupancy requirement by HKMC on the basis of the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii); and

(2) whether consideration will be given to the enhancement of the existing arrangement to provide further assistance to homeowners under MIP who wish to seek alternative accommodation by waiving their restriction on purchasing additional residential properties in Hong Kong for a period of up to 12 months, so as to give them a window of time to dispose of their properties under MIP upon acquisition of new properties; if not, of the reason for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) is administered by the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) for promoting home ownership in Hong Kong. In August 2024, the HKMCI put in place a new arrangement under the MIP to approve on a case-by-case basis eligible homeowners' applications for renting out their self-occupied properties, so as to help them meet their special needs arising from changes in personal or family circumstances (new arrangement).

 After consulting the HKMCI, our reply to the two parts of the question is as follows:

(1) As of end-June 2025, the HKMCI has received about 1 800 applications for the new arrangement. Among them, 1 697 applications were approved, while the remaining applications were either rejected for not meeting the eligibility requirements or are under processing. The breakdowns of the applications approved are as follows:




Reason for application
Number


The homeowner's family is expecting newborn(s) or
			adopting child(ren), resulting in a change in housing needs
336
			(20%)


The homeowner has become unemployed and requires more
			flexible housing or financial arrangements
41
			(2%)


The homeowner has other special needs to rent out his/her property, and has been residing in the relevant property for
			not less than 12 months
1 320
			(78%)


Total
1 697
			(100%)




(2) As the aim of the MIP is to promote home ownership, the owner occupancy requirement remains a key eligibility criterion of the MIP. The new arrangement is an exceptional measure that seeks to assist those with special needs. In fact, the MIP by nature is an insurance product, with credit risk being one of the key factors of consideration. If homeowners who have been given consent to rent out their properties under the MIP are allowed to purchase additional residential properties without having sold their existing ones, it is likely for the respective homeowners to take on extra financing liabilities on top of their current high loan-to-value ratio mortgage loans. This will bring additional credit risk to the MIP.

 The new arrangement has been launched for around one year and operating smoothly, offering substantial assistance to homeowners with special needs. The HKMCI has no plan to make changes to the new arrangement at the moment, and will keep the MIP under review from time to time in the light of the market circumstances."
立法會十四題：海洋公園登山纜車,2025-07-09 12:00,2025-07-09 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900337.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上田北辰議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

根據海洋公園公司的資料，二○二三至二四年度海洋公園的總入場人次多達314萬，而據悉園內可讓搭乘遊客欣賞沿途景色的登山纜車極受歡迎。然而，本人近日收到不少市民反映，雖然該園設有兩組來回、合共四線的登山纜車，但園方在大部分周末及公眾假期僅開放其中一組共兩線供遊客使用，導致輪候纜車時間最少半個小時，大大影響遊客的體驗及對香港觀感。本人得悉纜車操作員需具備高空拯救技能及考取牌照，園方因人力資源所限，以致未能在全年所有周末及公眾假期（約120天）全面開放四線登山纜車服務。就此，政府可否告知本會，是否知悉：

（一）園方有否評估在全年所有周末及公眾假期（共約120天），開放所有登山纜車線服務所需的額外人手為何；及

（二）園方會否考慮從內地或其他地區招聘具經驗的纜車操作員，以應付日益增加的遊客需求；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

海洋公園（公園）的登山纜車是公園的標誌性設施，多年來為訪客提供獨特的遊樂體驗。現時公園共設兩組纜車，每組包括登山和下山路線各一，車程每程約13分鐘，每組每小時最多接載4 000名訪客。除登山纜車外，在二○○九年九月投入服務的海洋列車（列車）亦為訪客提供登山和下山的另一選擇。列車車程每程約四分鐘，每小時可運載高達一萬名訪客。由於列車能同時接載更多訪客，而每程時間亦較短，可為訪客提供更快捷往返兩個園區的服務，因此列車現時是往返公園山下及山上園區的主要交通工具。登山纜車則已逐漸成為園內的景點體驗設施，是公園最受歡迎的遊樂體驗設施之一。

就田北辰議員的提問，經諮詢公園，現回覆如下：

公園一直根據《架空纜車（安全）條例》（第211章）操作及保養纜車，以確保纜車服務的安全及可靠程度達至法例要求。除了每天進行例行機件檢查及運作測試，纜車系統須經多項定期檢查及預防性維修保養，例如纜塔頂滑輪組維修、車廂及後備發電機組檢查及保養等，方可運載乘客。為了確保纜車系統安全運作，纜車操作員及纜車控制員須持有由政府機電工程署發出的相關牌照，以確保他們具備所需的技能、專業知識和資歷。有意於公園考取纜車操作員牌照的人士須於訓練期間，在持牌控制員及操作員的指導下接受纜車系統日常運作、救援、維修保養、於纜車塔頂工作等一系列的訓練，並累積最少一年的在職經驗，才符合資格考取相關牌照，考獲牌照後仍須在纜車控制員的監督下方可操作纜車。而有意於公園考取纜車控制員牌照的人士則須先取得纜車操作員牌照，並在其後累積最少一年的實際經驗，同時具備執行大型部件更換和快速故障處理的能力，才符合資格考取相關牌照。

公園的纜車團隊現時共有七名纜車操作員及九名纜車控制員。在二○二四／二五財政年度（註），公園為訪客提供342日纜車服務，當中56日提供兩組纜車服務，其餘日子則提供一組纜車服務。公園現時另有九名在職員工正接受培訓和考取專業資格。倘若公園全年無間斷營運纜車，並於所有週末及公眾假期共約120日提供兩組纜車服務（天氣不許可或更換纜索等大型工程除外），公園需額外物色及增聘16名合適的新員工，讓他們接受培訓，以及累積所須的在職經驗後考取相關牌照。

為了向訪客提供優質的遊樂體驗，在纜車操作方面，公園一直積極透過內部培訓及對外招募增加人手。除了刊登網上招聘廣告，公園亦定期舉辦招聘日，為有意加入的應徵者提供即場面試，並向獲取錄的員工提供入職獎金、高空工作律貼、救援津貼、生日假期、工作周年假期等福利，務求招募更多合適人手投入相關工作。然而，纜車操作及維修的工作性質比較專門，而過去員工流失率亦高，公園已察悉難在本地勞工市場招聘有意入行的合適入才。有見及此，除了繼續積極於本地進行招聘工作外，公園自二○二四年九月起透過勞工處的「補充勞工優化計劃」，從內地招聘具三年以上纜車相關經驗的技術人員。上述九位現時正接受公園纜車系統培訓和考取專業資格的在職員工中，四位是透過計劃從內地招募的技術人員。

公園一直按恰當運用資源的原則，考慮不同因素，包括當天是平日或假期、天氣情況、園內推廣活動、特備節目地點及時間等，以安排每天的纜車服務應付預測的入場人數。

註：公園的財政年度由每年的七月一日至來年的六月三十日。在二○二四／二五財政年度，因休園日公園共12日沒有開放。另外，由於需要進行纜車維修保養及受颱風影響，該年度公園另有11日並沒有提供纜車服務。"
LCQ14: Ocean Park Cable Car,2025-07-09 12:00,2025-07-09 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900349.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Michael Tien and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

According to information from the Ocean Park Corporation, the total visitor numbers of Ocean Park (OP) in 2023-24 reached 3.14 million. It is learnt that the Cable Car is an immensely popular attraction that offers visitors the opportunity to relish scenic views during their journey. However, quite a number of members of the public have recently relayed to me that while the OP Cable Car is a two-lane ropeway system comprising two sets of round-trip cable cars with a total of four lanes, the OP only operates one set of two-lane ropeway for visitors on most weekends and public holidays, and as a result the waiting time for cable cars is at least half an hour, which has significantly undermined visitors' experience and their image of Hong Kong. I have learnt that as cable car operators are required to have high-angle rescue skills and obtain a licence, the OP is unable to put all four cable car lanes into full operation on all weekends and public holidays throughout the year (approximately 120 days) due to limited manpower resources. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council whether it knows:

(1) whether the OP has assessed the additional manpower required to operate all the cable car lanes on all weekends and public holidays throughout the year (approximately a total of 120 days); and

(2) whether the OP will consider recruiting experienced cable car operators from the Mainland or other regions to cope with the growing visitor demand; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Cable Car at Ocean Park (OP) is an iconic attraction of the OP. For many years, it has been providing visitors with a unique recreational experience. The OP has two sets of cable car ropeways, each comprising an ascent route and a descent route. Each one-way ride takes about 13 minutes and each set of ropeway is capable of transporting up to 4 000 visitors per hour. Apart from the Cable Car, the Ocean Express (OE), a train launched in September 2009, provides an alternative means for travelling between the lower and upper parks of the OP, carrying up to 10 000 passengers per hour and taking about 4 minutes for each one-way ride. As the OE has a higher passenger capacity and shorter travel time, it has become the primary mode of transportation offering quicker travelling for visitors between the OP's lower and upper parks. On the other hand, the Cable Car has gradually turned into an attraction to enrich visitor experience and is one of the most popular facilities of the OP.

In consultation with the OP, the reply to the question raised by the Hon Michael Tien is as follows:

The OP has been operating and maintaining the cable cars in accordance with the Aerial Ropeways (Safety) Ordinance (Cap 211) to ensure the safety and reliability of the cable car service in compliance with the statutory requirements. In addition to daily routine mechanical inspections and operational testing, the cable car system has to undergo a number of regular inspections and preventive maintenance (e.g. sheave maintenance at the top of the cable car trestles, inspection and maintenance of the cabins and back-up power generator, etc.) before it is deemed suitable for passenger service. To ensure safe operation of the cable car system, cable car operators and controllers are required to hold relevant licences issued by the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department to ensure that they possess the necessary skills, professional knowledge and qualifications. Prospective cable car operators who wish to apply for the relevant licence at the OP have to undergo a series of training on the cable car system's daily operation, rescue, repair and maintenance, work on cable car trestles under the guidance of licensed controllers and operators during the training period, and accumulate at least one year of on-the-job experience, in order to be eligible for applying the licence. After obtaining the licence, they can only operate the cable car under the supervision of a cable car controller. Those who intend to obtain a cable car controller licence at the OP have to first acquire a cable car operator licence, accumulate at least one year of practical experience thereafter, and demonstrate the ability to perform large-scale component replacement and rapid fault handling before they are qualified to apply for the relevant licence.

The OP's cable car team currently consists of seven operators and nine controllers. In its 2024/25 financial year (Note), the OP provided visitors with 342 days of cable car service, including dual-ropeway service for 56 days and single-ropeway service for the remaining days. Currently, nine existing staff members of the OP are undergoing training and obtaining professional qualifications. If the OP were to operate the cable car continuously throughout the year and provide dual-ropeway cable car service on all weekends and public holidays for a total of about 120 days (except for extreme weather or major works such as cable replacement, etc.), the OP would need to identify and recruit an additional 16 new staff members to undergo training and accumulate the necessary on-the-job experience for applying for the relevant licences.

To provide visitors with quality recreational experience, the OP has been actively seeking to increase the manpower of its cable car operations through internal training as well as external recruitment. Apart from online job advertisement, the OP organises recruitment days on a regular basis and offers on-site interview opportunities for prospective candidates. Successful candidates are provided with benefits such as new joiner bonus, work-at-height allowance, rescue allowance, birthday leave, anniversary leave, etc, in order to recruit more suitable candidates to join the relevant job. However, as the job nature of cable car operations and maintenance are relatively specialised and the turnover rate is high, the OP finds it challenging to recruit suitable candidates from the local labour market. In light of this, apart from the continuing active local recruitment, the OP has been recruiting technical staff with at least three years of cable car-related experience from the Mainland since September 2024 under the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme of the Labour Department. Of the nine existing staff members who are currently receiving training and acquiring professional qualifications, four were recruited from the Mainland through the Scheme.

As a practice, in determining the cable car service to be provided to cater for the projected number of visitors each day, the OP will abide by the principle of proper utilisation of resources and take into account various factors, including whether the day is a weekday or a holiday, weather conditions, in-park promotional activities, and the location and schedule of special events, etc.

Note: The OP's financial year (FY) starts on every July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following year. In FY 2024/25, the park was closed for 12 days due to its dark day arrangement. And, owing to cable car maintenance and typhoon, the cable car service was suspended for another 11 days."

問題：

為支援長者就業，勞工處推行「中高齡就業計劃」（該計劃），向僱主發放在職培訓津貼，鼓勵僱主聘用年滿40歲或以上的失業求職人士。關於支援中高齡人士就業，政府可否告知本會：

（二）會否就該計劃訂立績效指標，例如分別設定40歲至59‍歲、60歲至64歲和65歲或以上人士佔總勞動人口參與率的目標，並適時檢視該計劃在推動中高齡求職人士就業方面的成效；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；

（三）會否增撥資源優化現有支援中高齡就業的措施和提供針對性的就業支援，包括舉辦不同類型的專題招聘會（例如專門為中高齡人士而設的兼職工作招聘會）、加強長者就業培訓，以及提供個人化的就業諮詢和求職配對服務，從而全方位協助中高齡人士重投職場；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

答覆：

主席：

勞工處推行「中高齡就業計劃」，鼓勵僱主聘請40歲或以上人士並提供在職培訓。僱主聘用每名60歲或以上失業或已離開職場的求職人士，並為他們提供在職培訓，可獲發每月最高5,000元的在職培訓津貼，為期六至12個月；而聘用每名40歲至59歲失業求職人士的最高在職培訓津貼金額則為每月4,000元，為期三至六個月。

就議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）二○二○年至二○二四年，「中高齡就業計劃」每年分別錄得2260宗、3340宗、2707宗、3873宗及4443宗合資格就業個案，涉及937名、1266名、1169名、1420名及1559名僱主。

（二）及（三）勞工處致力提供多元化的就業服務，促進中高齡人士就業。勞工處的十所就業中心為中高齡人士提供就業支援及專項服務，包括優先就業轉介服務和就業講座。中心的就業主任亦為他們提供個人化的就業諮詢、求職配對服務，以及培訓／再培訓課程的資料。此外，勞工處「互動就業服務」網站已設立「年長求職人士專頁」、「兼職職位專頁」，方便中高齡人士獲取最新就業資訊和尋找合適空缺。

為配合政府「促進銀髮經濟工作組」釋放「銀色生產動力」的目標，勞工處二○二五年將會舉辦約60場適合中高齡人士的大型或地區性專題招聘會，較去年的場次增加一倍。中高齡求職人士在招聘會可即場申請職位及面試，加快求職過程。

勞工處二○二四年七月十五日推出為期三年的「再就業津貼試行計劃」（再就業計劃），鼓勵連續三個月或以上沒有從事任何獲酬工作的40歲或以上人士投入就業市場。截至二○二五年六月，再就業計劃已錄得超過45000名參加者及接近23000宗就業個案，遠超原定在推行計劃三年期間可惠及6 000名就業人士的目標。其中，涉及60歲或以上的參加人數及就業個案數目約佔總數的四分之一。勞工處歡迎聘請再就業計劃參加者的僱主同時參加「中高齡就業計劃」。

勞工處將於二○二六年第一季就再就業計劃進行中期檢討，配合「中高齡就業計劃」，探討進一步促進中高齡人士就業的措施。

由於就業個案的數目受經濟、勞工市場及求職人士個人情況等因素影響，為勞動人口參與率制定關鍵績效指標並不合適。

（四）政府一直鼓勵僱主「不論年齡、唯才是用」，並按企業的情況採納長者友善僱傭措施，例如延長僱員的工作年齡、提供靈活的工作安排，以及締造適合長者工作的環境等，讓更多年長人士繼續或再就業。

勞工處會繼續進行宣傳推廣，並推行就業計劃，鼓勵僱主聘用中高齡人士。由於企業聘用員工的考慮及情況不同，政府目前沒有計劃以立法方式規管企業僱用長者員工。"

Question:

 To support the employment of elderly persons, the Labour Department has implemented the Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged (EPEM) to provide employers with on-the-job training allowance to encourage them to engage unemployed job seekers aged 40 or above. On supporting the employment of elderly and middle-aged persons, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of employers involved in the placements eligible for joining the EPEM in the past five years;

(2) whether it will formulate performance indicators for the EPEM, such as setting separate targets for the participation rates of persons aged 40 to 59, 60 to 64 and 65 or above in the total labour force, and review in a timely manner the effectiveness of the EPEM in promoting the employment of elderly and middle-aged job seekers; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) whether it will allocate additional resources to enhance the existing measures to support the employment of elderly and middle-aged persons and provide targeted employment support, including organising different types of thematic job fairs (e.g. job fairs on part-time jobs specially designed for elderly and middle-aged persons), enhancing employment training for elderly persons, as well as providing personalised employment counselling and job-matching services, thereby assisting elderly and middle-aged persons in re-‍entering the workforce in a holistic manner; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) whether it will consider drawing reference from the practices of neighbouring countries and formulating, by way of legislation, guidelines for employers on the re-employment of elderly persons, as well as designing suitable job types and setting remuneration according to the abilities of elderly persons, thereby regulating the responsibility of enterprises in employing elderly staff; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Labour Department (LD) implements the Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged (EPEM) to encourage employers to hire persons aged 40 or above, and provide them with on-the-job training (OJT). Employers engaging job seekers aged 60 or above who are unemployed or have left the workforce and providing them with OJT will receive a maximum OJT allowance of $5,000 per month per employee for six to 12 months; while engaging unemployed job seekers aged 40 to 59 will receive a maximum OJT allowance of $4,000 per month per employee for three to six months.

 In response to the Member's question, the reply is provided as follows:

(1) From 2020 to 2024, the EPEM recorded respectively 2260, 3340, 2707, 3873 and 4443 eligible placements in each year, involving 937, 1266, 1169, 1420 and 1559 employers.

(2) and (3) The LD is committed to providing diversified employment services to promote the employment of elderly and middle-aged persons. The ten job centres of the LD provides elderly and middle-aged persons with employment support and dedicated services, including priority job referral service, employment briefings. Employment officers of the centres also provide personalised employment advisory and job matching services, as well as information on training/re-training courses to them. Moreover, the LD has set up the Dedicated Webpage for Elderly Job Seekers and the Dedicated Webpage on Part-time Jobs on the Interactive Employment Service website, so as to facilitate elderly and middle-aged persons to obtain the latest employment information and search for suitable vacancies.

 To tie in with the target of unleashing ""silver productivity"" put forth by the Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy, the LD will stage about 60 large-scale or district-based thematic job fairs suitable for elderly and middle-aged persons in 2025, doubling the number of fairs compared to last year. Elderly and middle-aged job seekers can submit job applications and attend interviews on the spot to expedite the job seeking process.

 The LD launched the three-year Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme (REA Scheme) on July 15, 2024 to encourage persons aged 40 or above, who have not been in paid work for three consecutive months or more, to join the employment market. As at June 2025, over 45000 participants and nearly 23000 placements were recorded, far exceeding the original target of benefiting 6000 employed persons during the three-year implementation period. Of which, about one quarter of the participants and placements involved persons aged 60 or above. The LD welcomes employers taking on the participants of the REA Scheme to join the EPEM.

 The LD will conduct a mid-term review on the REA Scheme in the first quarter of 2026, along with the EPEM, to explore further measures to encourage the employment of elderly and middle-aged persons.

 As the number of placements may be affected by various factors such as the economy, labour market situation and the personal circumstances of job seekers, it is inappropriate to set key performance indicators for the labour force participation rate.

(4) The Government has been encouraging employers to follow the principle of ""Count on Talent, Not Age in Employment"" and, having regard to the individual circumstances of their enterprises, to adopt elderly-friendly employment practices such as extending the working life of employees, providing flexible work arrangements, fostering an environment conducive to elderly employment, so as to facilitate more older persons to stay in or rejoin the labour market.

 The LD will continue to conduct publicity and promotional activities as well as implement employment programmes to encourage employers to hire elderly and middle-aged persons. Owing to the varied considerations and circumstances of enterprises in recruiting staff, the Government currently has no plan to regulate the employment of older employees through legislation."

問題：

在國家的支持下，國際調解院的總部正式落戶香港，並預計於本年年底或明年年初投入運作。此外，33個國家於本年五月三十日簽署《關於建立國際調解院的公約》。有意見認為由於國際調解院是首個把總部設在香港的政府間國際組織，將進一步加強香港作為「亞太區主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心」的定位。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否估算國際調解院將為香港帶來的效益，或訂立成效指標（例如新增調解員、翻譯員和研究員等崗位的數量，以及新進駐的國際組織、非政府機構和學術機構的數量）；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何，以及會否考慮作出相關估算和訂立成效指標；

（三）據報所有國家，不限於簽約國，均能使用國際調解院的服務，但有意見認為由於法律具有高度區域性（即不同司法管轄區使用不同法律體系和制度），爭議雙方對法理的理解不同，令他們期望調解服務可達致的成果可能大相徑庭，國際調解院總部會否訂立協調政策，以保障其調解服務可達致來自不同司法管轄區的爭議方均感到滿意的合理水平？

答覆：

主席︰

就林健鋒議員的提問，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（三）國際調解院落戶香港，有助吸引世界各地人士來港以調解及其他方式解決爭議，加強香港作為國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位。國際調解院落戶香港更可吸引更多國際組織、非政府組織和學術機構進駐，進一步鞏固香港的國際地位和知名度。預期為香港帶來正面的經濟效益。國際調解院的落戶會為香港創造更多就業機會，如調解員、翻譯員、研究員和行政人員等，並吸引國際法律專業人士和學者來港，有助推動法律實務、研究和國際司法合作的發展，加強香港的國際法律網絡。座落在灣仔的國際調解院總部，將不但促進香港的國際法律和爭議解決服務發展，而且吸引更多國際會議和展覽等相關活動在香港舉行，繼而促進酒店、餐飲和運輸物流等其他行業的發展。

LCQ15: International Organization for Mediation,2025-07-09 11:45,2025-07-09 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900351.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Jeffrey Lam and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

With the support of our country, the headquarters of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) has been formally established in Hong Kong and is expected to come into operation by the end of this year or early next year. In addition, 33 countries signed the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (the Convention) on May 30 this year. There are views that as IOMed is the first international inter-governmental organisation setting up its headquarters in Hong Kong, the position of Hong Kong as ""the leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific Region"" will further be strengthened. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has estimated the benefits to be brought to Hong Kong by IOMed or set the relevant performance indicators (e.g. the numbers of additional positions, such as mediators, translators and researchers, etc, to be created, as well as the numbers of international organisations, non-governmental organisations and academic institutions which will establish a new presence in Hong Kong); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will consider making the relevant estimations and setting performance indicators;

(2) whether it knows if IOMed has formulated the specific selection criteria for mediators, as well as the relevant guidelines and review mechanism, so as to ensure that mediators are able to provide mediation services at a reasonable professional standard; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and when such formulation will be completed; and

(3) while it has been reported that all countries, not limited to the signatories of the Convention, have access to the services of IOMed, there are views that given the nature of the law which is highly specific to a particular region (i.e. different jurisdictions have different legal systems and regimes), the outcome which can be achieved through mediation services may significantly fall short of expectation of the parties to a dispute since legal concepts may subject to different interpretations by different parties, whether the headquarters of IOMed will formulate co-ordination policies to ensure that its mediation services will bring a reasonable level of satisfaction to the parties to disputes from different jurisdictions?

Reply:

President,

In response to the enquiry raised by the Hon Jeffrey Lam, the consolidated reply is as follows:

(1) and (3)The establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong will assist in attracting people from all over the world to come to Hong Kong to resolve disputes through mediation and other means, strengthening Hong Kong's position as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre. IOMed also attracts more international organisations, non-governmental organisations and academic institutions to settle in Hong Kong, which further consolidate Hong Kong's international status and reputation. It is expected to bring positive economic benefits to Hong Kong. The establishment of IOMed will create more employment opportunities for Hong Kong, such as mediators, translators, researchers and administrative staff. This also attracts international legal professionals and scholars to Hong Kong, which will help promoting the development of legal practice, research and international judicial co-operation, and strengthening Hong Kong's international legal network. The IOMed headquarters being located in Wan Chai will not only promote the development of Hong Kong's international legal and dispute resolution services, but also attract more international conferences and exhibitions and other related activities to be held in Hong Kong, thereby promoting the development of other sectors such as hotels, catering and transportation logistics.

âIOMed will be officially established with its headquarters to be formally set up in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region following the adoption, signing and entry into force of the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation. IOMed has not yet commenced its operation and hence no further details may be provided at the present stage. Same as other international inter-governmental organisations, IOMed will be an independent international organisation, which will make its own policy and decision for its operation (including whether and how to set any key performance indicator or any co-ordination policy).

(2)Chapter IV (Articles 19 to 23) of the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation governs the Panel of Mediators of IOMed, including designation of mediators, qualifications of mediators and their term of office. Please see www.international-mediation.org/basic-documentsfor the Articles under the Convention."
立法會十九題：啟德體育園周邊的泊車安排,2025-07-09 11:15,2025-07-09 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900256.htm,"​以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上楊永杰議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

據報每逢啟德體育園（體育園）舉辦演唱會和大型賽事，不少私家車違法停泊在體育園周邊區域的道路，造成交通嚴重堵塞，並對其他道路使用者構成危險。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）警方在體育園周邊區域針對涉及違法駕駛者所採取的執法行動為何，以及有否評估該等行動的成效；

（二）鑑於體育園在舉辦演唱會和賽事期間會暫停開放私家車泊車位及上落客位，政府會否考慮調整有關安排，在大型活動期間開放該園的私家車泊車位及上落客位予公眾使用；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）有否研究在體育園鄰近地方興建多層停車場，以解決該區域泊車位不足問題；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就楊永杰議員關於啟德體育園周邊泊車安排的提問，經諮詢文化體育及旅遊局、警務處及運輸署，我現綜合回覆如下：

（一）警務處一直密切監察啟德體育園周邊道路在舉行大型活動期間的交通情況。如果發現有司機違例泊車，造成交通嚴重阻塞，或對其他道路使用者構成危險，警務處除了會對有關人士和車輛採取執法行動外，亦會按情況在不予警告下即時把車輛拖走。

自啟德體育園由本年三月開幕至六月中旬期間，園區曾舉辦七項大型活動，活動總日數為十九日。期間，警務處共發出190張定額罰款通知書及拖走15輛違例車輛。

警務處將繼續根據「重點交通執法項目」打擊交通違例行為，確保道路暢順及保障道路使用者安全。


（二）及（三）目前，啟德體育園區共提供約600個私家車泊車位供日常前往園區的駕駛者使用。在大型活動舉行期間，考慮到園區附近一帶的交通較為繁忙，為配合人流及交通管理，政府一直呼籲前往園區的觀眾乘搭公共交通工具，避免駕駛或乘坐私家車。因應活動的規模，運輸署會協調公共交通營辦商調整公共交通服務，在相關時段加密港鐵屯馬綫的班次、按需要加強巴士服務或安排特別巴士路線等，配合活動進行期間額外的交通需求。

運輸署亦就園區交通事宜與文化體育及旅遊局、其他相關部門及啟德體育園有限公司保持緊密溝通，商討進一步優化安排。在汲取各個大型活動的經驗和私家車使用者的意見後，為提供更佳便利，園區已於今年六月起在大型活動期間開放啟德主場館的士上落客區供的士上落客之用，亦增設啟德體藝館泊車位預約服務。有需要的駕駛者可預先購買啟德體藝館停車場泊車證和提前預約，以在大型活動期間使用部分泊車位。此外，園區附近亦有其他泊車地點，例如距離約10至15分鐘步程的兩個購物商場共提供約1 300個私家車泊位。駕駛者可透過運輸署的「香港出行易」程式，查閱園區及上述兩個商場泊車設施的可用車位實時資訊。

如上所述，啟德體育園區及鄰近商場共提供約1 900個私家車泊位。運輸署會與啟德體育園有限公司緊密聯繫，善用現有泊車設施並持續優化園區的泊車安排。運輸署亦會持續監察區內整體泊車需求，並與相關部門適時檢討，確保交通配套與區域發展相配合。"
LCQ19: Parking arrangements around Kai Tak Sports Park,2025-07-09 11:15,2025-07-09 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900261.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Yang Wing-kit and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

It is reported that whenever concerts and major games are held at the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP), many private cars are illegally parked on roads around KTSP, causing severe traffic congestion and posing dangers to other road users. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the enforcement actions taken by the Police against persons involved in driving offences in areas surrounding KTSP, and whether the effectiveness of such actions has been assessed;

(2) given that private car parking spaces and pick-up/drop-off areas at KTSP are temporarily closed when concerts and games are held there, whether the Government will consider adjusting such arrangements to allow public access to private car parking spaces and pick-up/drop-off areas at KTSP during major events; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it has conducted studies on constructing a multi-storey car park in the vicinity of KTSP to address the shortage of parking spaces in the area; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

After consulting the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Transport Department (TD), my consolidated response to the questions raised by the Hon Yang Wing-kit regarding the parking arrangements around the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) is as follows:

(1) The HKPF has always been closely monitoring the road traffic conditions around the KTSP during major events. When illegal parking activities causing severe traffic congestion or endangering other road users are spotted, the HKPF will take enforcement action against the motorists and vehicles involved and, where appropriate, tow the vehicles away without prior warning.

Since the commissioning of the KTSP in March up to mid-June this year, the venue has hosted seven major events spanning 19 days, during when the HKPF issued a total of 190 fixed penalty notices and towed away 15 illegally parked vehicles.

The HKPF will continue to combat traffic offences in accordance with the Selected Traffic Enforcement Priorities to ensure smooth traffic flow and protect the safety of road users.

(2) and (3) At present, the KTSP provides about 600 private cars (PC) parking spaces for the daily use of motorists. During major events, in view of heavier traffic in KTSP's vicinity and in order to facilitate crowd and traffic management, the Government always encourages visitors to use public transport, avoid driving or taking PCs. Having regard to the scale of the event, the TD will co-ordinate with public transport operators to adjust public transport services, enhancing the interval between trains of the MTR Tuen Ma Line during such occasions, enhacing bus services or arranging special bus services as needed to meet the additional traffic demand during the event period.

The TD also maintains close communication with the CSTB, other relevant departments, and Kai Tak Sports Park Limited regarding traffic issues around the KTSP, and discusses further enhancements to traffic arrangements. Drawing on the experience of various large-scale events and feedback from PC users, the KTSP has, since June this year, opened the taxi pick-up/drop-off area at Kai Tak Stadium for taxi use and introduced a parking space booking service for PC users at Kai Tak Arena to enhance convenience. Motorists with parking needs may purchase parking voucher in advance to reserve parking spaces at the Kai Tak Arena car park during major events. In addition, there are other parking spaces available near the KTSP, including two shopping malls within a 10 to 15-minute walk that collectively offer about 1 300 PC parking spaces. Motorists may check real-time parking vacancy information of car parks at the KTSP and the above two shopping malls via TD's ""HKeMobility"" mobile application.

As mentioned above, the KTSP and the nearby shopping malls together offer a total of about 1 900 PC parking spaces. The TD will maintain close liaison with Kai Tak Sports Park Limited for making optimal use of the exitsing parking facilities and continuing to enhance the parking arranagements in the KTSP. The TD will also continue to monitor the overall parking demand in the district, and conduct timely review with relevant departments to ensure the transport facilities keep pace with the district development."

Speech by FS at Hong Kong - Korea Capital Markets Conference (English only) (with photos),2025-07-09 10:52,2025-07-09 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900263.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Hong Kong – Korea Capital Markets Conference held in Seoul, Korea today (July 9):

Mr Seo (Chairman of the Korea Financial Investment Association, Mr Seo Yoo-seok), Greg (Managing Director and Head of Markets, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, Mr Gregory Yu), Ms Ding Chen (Chief Executive Officer of CSOP Asset Management Limited), ladies and gentlemen,

Annyeonghaseyo. Good morning.

It is a great honour and pleasure to be here with you today in Seoul. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to CSOP Asset Management and all the co-organisers for bringing together such a distinguished gathering. I am especially pleased to see so many esteemed representatives from Korean institutional investors, securities firms, asset managers, regulators, and, of course, our colleagues from Hong Kong's financial community.

Hong Kong: what's up

Allow me to begin with a snapshot of Hong Kong's current position, as reflected in international rankings. This year, Hong Kong is once again ranked among the world's top three financial centres. We were also named as the world's third most competitive economy by Switzerland's IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook. Last year, the Fraser Institute of Canada reaffirmed our status as the world's freest economy. Our city continues to enjoy positive credit ratings from all three major international agencies—Fitch, Standard & Poor's, and Moody's—with stable outlooks.

These accolades are not symbolic. They reflect the resilience of our financial markets and the confidence international investors place in Hong Kong. Last year, our stock market rose by 18 per cent, and it has already gained another 20 per cent so far this year. Initial public offerings (IPOs) have raised about $16 billion this year to date, making Hong Kong the world's leading IPO venue so far this year. Meanwhile, total bank deposits grew by 7per cent last year, i.e. about US$13 billion, and again by around 7per cent this year, now surpassing US$2.3 trillion, about 6 times our GDP. Our asset and wealth management sector currently manages around US$4 trillion, and is on track to become the world's top cross-border wealth management centre by 2028.

These positive developments are driven by our strong fundamentals, a steadily growing China and the shifting global financial landscape. At the core of Hong Kong's success are our enduring values: openness, diversity, international character and global connectivity. Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong preserves its free port status, with the free flow of capital, information, goods and talent. We uphold the common law system with an independent judiciary. In our Court of Final Appeal, there are six overseas non-permanent judges coming from the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and New Zealand. In the Rule of Law Index of the World Justice Report, Hong Kong ranks among the global top 25, and in the top 10 for free of corruption. Our currency is pegged to the United States (US) dollar and remains freely convertible. The Linked Exchange Rate System functions smoothly despite geopolitical fragmentation, and capital flow volatility.

The Central Government of China has repeatedly reaffirmed time and again that the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement for Hong Kong is not for expediency; it is here to stay for the long term. As a two-way gateway between the Chinese Mainland and the world, Hong Kong plays a unique and indispensable role for the country's high-level two-way opening up.

Indeed, over the past few years, we have gone through some challenges. But once again Hong Kong has restored political stability as well as law and order, and emerge stronger and more resilient than ever.

Global dynamics and investment trends

Looking ahead, the global political, economic and financial environment are undergoing profound transformations, and this morning I would like to highlight just three key points. First, the geopolitical climate and the policy uncertainty in the United States. These conditions are expected to persist for some time, and have prompted investors to reassess risk, diversify capital allocations and seek markets that offer both resilience and growth. In this context, Hong Kong stands out as a safe harbour for global capital, providing policy consistency, predictability and strategic access to China and the broader Asian region.

Recent data underscores this momentum. The rally in our stock market since last year has been fuelled by both Mainland and international capital. In February this year, Korean investors made their highest monthly net investment in Hong Kong equities in three years. Very good foresight. And they were not alone. Since September last year, waves of capital from the US and Europe had also poured in, as global investors realised that they had under-allocated to the Greater China market.

We expect continued momentum, especially as more high-quality Mainland tech companies choose Hong Kong over US listings. We are also prepared for the return of Chinese concept stocks from the US.

The geopolitical recalibration is not temporary. It will also go beyond the financial market. Economies in our region are already calling for deeper collaboration across trade, manufacturing, supply chains and investment. This presents exciting opportunities for deeper collaboration between Hong Kong and Korea – two of Asia's most dynamic and sophisticated financial ecosystems.

The second point is the rapid acceleration of technological innovation, an area where Asia holds tremendous promise. For example, in China, we are seeing major breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, electric vehicles, green technologies and advanced manufacturing. Open-source AI models such as DeepSeek are emerging as scalable, cost-effective solutions with wide-ranging applications. Increasingly, Chinese firms are turning to Hong Kong to raise capital to support the expansion of their global footprint.

  A recent example is CATL, the world's leading EV (electric vehicle) battery manufacturer, which completed the world's largest IPO so far this year in Hong Kong. The funds raised will support its expansion into Europe, including a new plant in Hungary. Currently, over 200 major Mainland companies are in the pipeline for listing in Hong Kong. Many of them are China's technology and new economy companies.

International investors are increasingly leveraging Hong Kong to take advantage of China's tech sector development. This trend is reflected in the performance of the Hang Seng Tech Index, which has gained more than 40per cent over the past year, driven by renewed investor interest and optimism.

The third point is the increasing importance of cross-border market connectivity. A unique strength of Hong Kong's capital market is our ""Connect Schemes"" with the Chinese Mainland, including Stock Connect, Bond Connect, ETF Connect, and more. These schemes are significant in two ways. First, they allow Mainland Chinese capital to flow into Hong Kong's markets, making us a convergence point for international and Mainland liquidity. Second, they offer trusted and familiar channels for international investors to access the Chinese markets. Today, over 70per cent of A-share holdings by international investors were acquired through the Northbound Stock Connect, and about two-thirds of Mainland cross-border bond transactions are conducted using Bond Connect.

Beyond the Chinese Mainland, we are also expanding mutual market access with other regions. A great example is our growing partnership with Saudi Arabia. In the past two years, we have listed ETFs in our respective stock markets. By the way, one ETF listed on Saudi's market tracking Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was issued by CSOP. It is now the largest ETF in the Middle East.

Indeed, our Exchange-Traded Products (ETP) market is booming. As of May 2025, Hong Kong hosts more than 210 ETPs with over US$65 billion in AUM (assets under management), a 10per cent increase year-on-year. Daily trading volumes had more than doubled compared to 2024, exceeding US$5 billion. This year, there have been 24 new product launches, including the cross-listing of the world's fifth-largest ETF from the US earlier this year.

We are actively encouraging global ETPs to enter the Hong Kong market, whether through direct cross-listings or master-feeder structures. Our ETF ecosystem is becoming more diverse and global, with growing demand for thematic products across stocks, fixed income, commodities, currencies and digital assets. In digital assets, Hong Kong leads Asia with 10 ETPs, including both spot and futures-based ones. Their AUM registered a 74per cent growth year-on-year in the first half of 2025, and a 33per centrise in daily turnover.

Some Korean firms are already active in our ETP market as issuers and market makers. We believe it is now the opportune moment to deepen our collaboration in this space through cross-listings, reciprocal arrangements and master-feeder partnerships.

Our HKEX colleagues will elaborate on these exciting opportunities shortly.

Finally, let me now turn to digital assets, a frontier where Hong Kong is taking bold and forward-looking steps to become a global hub. Our approach is pragmatic, risk-based and innovation-friendly. We believe digital assets will play a transformative role in de-intermediation and cross-border settlement. That said, we are also clear-eyed: appropriate regulatory safeguards are essential.

We have launched a licensing regime for Virtual Asset Trading Platforms, guided by the principle of ""same activity, same risk, same regulation"". Sound regulation, we believe, is not a constraint, but a catalyst for sustainable innovation. So far, we have licensed 11 VATPs, with balanced requirements on custody, anti-money laundering and investor protection.

We also support tokenisation across traditional finance, from green bonds to asset-backed security tokens and structured products.

Building on this foundation, we have passed legislation for stablecoins, which will come into effect on August 1. Our goal is to support stablecoins that serve real-world use cases, reducing transaction costs and enabling faster, safer cross-border payments.

Hong Kong's digital asset ecosystem continues to thrive, and many Web3 innovators are choosing to base themselves in our city. We see tremendous potential for Korean innovators and investors as well.

Concluding remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot better conclude by highlighting the compelling advantages we offer to Korean investors: no dividend tax, no capital gains tax, a low profits tax at only 16.5 per cent, trading in multiple currencies, including HKD, USD and RMB, and trading hours aligned with the Asian time zone.

Above all, we are entering a new era for Asia. Geopolitics, technological innovation and regional integration are converging. While they present challenges, they also create unprecedented opportunities. Hong Kong stands ready to be your partner, offering stability in uncertain times, unparalled access to the world's fastest-growing markets, and a platform built on transparency, trustworthiness and innovation.

Together, Hong Kong and Korea can build stronger bridges, unlock new investment frontiers, and shape the future of finance in Asia and beyond.

Kamsahamnida. Thank you."

LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-09 09:40,2025-07-09 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900254.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;

Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear long-sleeved and loose-fitting clothes; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.

  âThe Director of the Office of the Organising Committee of the 15th NG, 12th NGD and 9th NSOG and Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Government of Guangdong Province, Mr Huang Mingzhong; the Head of the NGCO, Mr Yeung Tak-keung; and the Head of the Preparatory Office in Macao, Mr Pun Weng-kun, addressed the conference, highlighting the collaborative progress of the three places. Hong Kong cyclist Wong Kam-po and Macao martial arts athlete Li Yi also shared their aspirations.

  âMr Huang said at the press conference that the cohosting of the 15th NG by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, under the steer of the central ministries including the General Administration of Sport of China and the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, has built an innovative co-ordination mechanism. Through close liaison and co-ordination, alignment has been reached in six key areas: cross-boundary events, port clearance, manpower and vehicle accreditation, food safety, green initiatives, and competition schedule. The three places have pioneered a ""three-place three-integration"" cohosting approach - integrated communication, direction, and operation.

  âMr Yeung said, ""Hong Kong firmly adheres to the principles of 'green, inclusive, open and clean' while implementing the requirement of organising a 'simple, safe and wonderful' event. We maintain strict budget control, optimise resource allocation, and prudently scale events to ensure practical preparations."" He highlighted that the cross-boundary athletics marathon and road cycling events, which will be co-organised by Hong Kong, are signature events of the 15th NG, requiring meticulous tripartite planning and co-ordination in route design and expedited clearance for athletes, spectators and vehicles. This cross-boundary collaboration enhances the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA)'s overall competitiveness and fosters people-to-people exchanges in the GBA. Wong said that with the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge as the race course, the cross-border road cycling race is an iconic event with beautiful scenery and a challenging course as well.

  âMr Pun said that preparations for the 15th NG have entered the countdown phase. They will collaborate with different sectors of society to strengthen the organisational work for the events, enhancing the atmosphere of community-wide participation in the 15th NG. This includes ongoing visits to communities and schools, connecting with promotional activities for culture, tourism, and sports, and launching franchised products in Macao.

  âVarious franchised products were also showcased at the press conference, with designers explaining their creative concepts. Hong Kong will soon set up sales points in various districts to sell a variety of franchised products related to the 15th NG, 12th NGD and 9th NSOG, including products with unique Hong Kong features.

After his arrival, he visited the Bank of Korea, the country's central bank, and met with its Governor, Mr Rhee Chang-yong, to exchange views on developments in finance, trade and economic landscapes of the two places, in the region and around the globe, as well as monetary and interest rate policies and investment trends. During the meeting, Mr Chan shared the latest developments in Hong Kong, particularly the continuous capital inflow to Hong Kong's financial system, reflecting international investors' confidence in Hong Kong in the current international environment. He stated that Hong Kong maintains a free and open economic and financial system and the Linked Exchange Rate System under the ""one country, two systems"" principle. Hong Kong's unique advantage of being connected to the Mainland and the world, as well as its highly internationalised characteristics, is further attracting more international participants and capital to enjoy opportunities brought by developments in China. Hong Kong's international ties are continuously deepening.

Thereafter, he visited the Korea Investment Corporation (KIC) and met with its President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Park Il-young. The KIC was established by the Korean government in 2005, responsible for managing part of the country's foreign exchange reserves and other public funds for overseas investments. Currently, over US$200 billion of assets are under its management. During the meeting, both sides had an in-depth exchange of opinions on various issues of mutual concern, such as trends of investment markets, asset allocation strategies and digital asset developments.

Mr Chan shared recent developments in Hong Kong's economic and financial markets and its important role in connecting capital and investors from China and around the globe. He said that Hong Kong's capital market is closely connected to the Mainland's innovation and technology (I&T) ecosystem. The recent stock market is vibrant, with many leading Mainland I&T enterprises having listed or planning to list in Hong Kong. To international investors, Hong Kong serves as a highly effective gateway to tap into I&T opportunities in Greater China. He welcomed Korean capital to better use the Hong Kong market to allocate international investments and jointly seize the vast business opportunities of I&T developments.

In the evening, Mr Chan had dinner with leaders in Korea's digital asset industry, where he shared Hong Kong's developments and opportunities in digital assets. He also encouraged the local industry to actively participate in the Hong Kong market and jointly explore and expand more applications and developments in digital assets.

為加快推展北環線項目，政府早前與港鐵公司簽訂古洞站項目協議時，已同時要求港鐵公司預留就北環線主線進行詳細規劃及設計和部分前期工程的相關預算。現時相關詳細規劃及設計工作包括法定程序已大致完成，前期工程亦已經開展。

政府發言人表示：「北環線項目的策略價值重大。政府發揮敢於破局的決心，果斷作出了三大突破，為項目提速提效。」

「第一，我們以全盤規劃、分段推展的策略推進北環線項目，將北環線支線連同主線合併作為一個項目進行規劃，以實現協同效益並節省成本。項目再分成兩部分推展以加快進度。現階段簽訂的第一部分項目協議可立即推動項目進展，並同步進行北環線支線的詳細規劃及設計和法定程序。」

「第二，秉持不斷創新的精神，我們正推行多項降低成本和加快建造的策略，並會成熟一項推一項，包括因應項目的跨境元素善用內地方式和能力建造，並在路政署設立專責小組處理審批，精簡項目整體流程和加快程序。這些措施不但可助提高跨境的北環線支線的建造效率，亦有望在一定程度上惠及北環線主線。」

「第三，按照以結果為目標的思維，我們通過引入與鐵路建造相關的內地標準、做法和資源提升建造效率，將北環線支線的規劃大幅提前，目標是與主線在二○三四年或之前同步開通，即較北環線支線原先估計的時間表提早約兩年。」

政府在獨立審核顧問的協助下，已嚴謹審視港鐵公司就北環線項目第一部分提供的財務預算，核實的項目預算約為314億元（按二○二五年七月價格計算）。

行政長官會同行政會議批准，採用「鐵路加物業」模式向港鐵公司批出錦上路站第二期、粉嶺北第13區（東）及第16區、古洞北第22區（東）、第26區（西）、第14區及第15區，和新田第4D區、第6A區及第2A區的用地作住宅及商業用途發展，將來會從按「設有鐵路」基礎評定的十足市值地價中，扣除一筆總數為390億5,000萬元的固定總額（按付款當日價格計算），作為對港鐵公司推展北環線項目第一部分的財務資助。

政府今日與港鐵公司簽訂的第一部分項目協議，會立即啓動較成熟和較迫切的工程，包括北環線主線當中由錦上路站通往牛潭尾車廠連接隧道和由新田站通往古洞站的兩段土木及結構工程，同時要求港鐵公司同步進行北環線支線的詳細規劃及設計，包括環境評估和鐵路方案刊憲等法定程序，並爭取以最快的速度完成。當相關法定程序完成後，便會盡快簽訂第二部分項目協議落實餘下的工程和營運安排。"

Chief Executive in Council approves financial arrangement for Part 1 of Northern Link Project,2025-07-08 19:08,2025-07-08 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800440.htm,"The Chief Executive in Council approved today (July 8) the financial arrangement for Part 1 of the Northern Link (NOL) Project. The Transport and Logistics Bureau and the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) have executed the Part 1 Project Agreement (PA) subsequently.

The NOL Project is a key transport infrastructure in support of the future development of Hong Kong. The NOL Main Line would become the public transportation backbone for multiple new development areas in the Northern Metropolis, providing efficient and reliable railway services to meet the transport demand from new population along the railway alignment. The NOL Spur Line, which is being taken forward together with Shenzhen through the Task Force for Hong Kong-Shenzhen Co-operation on Cross-Boundary Railway Infrastructure, would be a cross-boundary bifurcation of the NOL linking the metro networks of Hong Kong and Shenzhen, connecting to the new Huanggang Port through convenient co-location clearance arrangements and facilitating Hong Kong's better integration into the national development.

To expedite the implementation of the NOL Project, the Government already required the MTRCL to reserve relevant budget to undertake the detailed planning and design as well as part of the advance works for the NOL Main Line when executing the PA of the Kwu Tung Station with the MTRCL earlier. The relevant detailed planning and design including statutory procedures have been substantially completed and the advance works have also commenced.

A Government spokesman said, ""The NOL Project embodies significant strategic value. With a strong determination to break new ground, the Government has resolutely decided to make three major breakthroughs to enhance the speed and efficiency of the project.

  ""Firstly, we would take forward the NOL Project through a holistic planning and staged implementation strategy, planning the NOL Spur Line in combination with the NOL Main Line as one project to achieve synergies and realise cost savings. The project would be implemented under a two-part approach to expedite progress. The execution of Part 1 PA at this juncture could propel the project forward immediately, and in parallel carry out the detailed planning and design as well as statutory procedures for the NOL Spur Line.

  ""Secondly, in the spirit of innovating continuously, we are pursuing various strategies for reducing cost and accelerating project delivery, which would be implemented as soon as ready. Such strategies include leveraging Mainland approaches and capabilities in construction on account of the cross-boundary element of the project, and setting up a dedicated team in the Highways Department to handle building submissions in a manner which streamlines the overall project workflow and expedites procedures. These initiatives will not only improve the construction efficiency of the cross-boundary NOL Spur Line, but may also benefit the NOL Main Line to a certain extent.

  ""Thirdly, adopting a result-oriented mindset, we would improve the construction efficiency through adopting railway-related Mainland standards, practices and resources, substantially bringing forward the planning of the NOL Spur Line. The target is to commission the NOL Spur Line together with the NOL Main Line by 2034 or earlier, which is about two years earlier than what was originally envisaged.""

The Government, supported by an independent checking consultant, has critically examined the financial estimates provided by the MTRCL in relation to Part 1 of the NOL Project, and verified that the capital cost estimate is about $31.4 billion (in July 2025 prices).

The Chief Executive in Council approved the grant of sites at Kam Sheung Road Station Phase 2; Fanling North Area 13 (East) and Area 16; Kwu Tung North Area 22 (East), Area 26 (West), Area 14 and Area 15; as well as San Tin Area 4D, Area 6A and Area 2A to the MTRCL for residential and commercial development under the ""Rail-plus-Property"" model. A total fixed lump sum of $39.05 billion (in money-of-the-day prices) would be deducted from the full market value land premium of the sites assessed on a ""with-railway"" basis in the future as funding support to the MTRCL in implementing Part 1 of the NOL Project.

The execution of the Part 1 PA between the Government and the MTRCL today would immediately kick-start works that are more ready and time-critical, including the civil and structural works of two sections of the NOL Main Line from the Kam Sheung Road Station to the intersection with the approach tunnels to Ngau Tam Mei Depot and from the San Tin Station to the Kwu Tung Station. The MTRCL is required to carry out the detailed planning and design of the NOL Spur Line simultaneously, including statutory procedures relating to the environmental impact assessment and railway scheme gazettal, and strive for completion as early as possible. The Part 2 PA would be executed to finalise the arrangements for the remaining works and operation as soon as possible after completion of the relevant statutory procedures."

Opening remarks by Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services) at Deloitte's Digital Asset Forum (English only) (with photos),2025-07-08 18:40,2025-07-08 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800687.htm,"  Following are the opening remarks by the Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services), Ms Salina Yan, at the Deloitte's Digital Asset Forum ""Digital Assets in Focus - Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance in Hong Kong"" today (July 8):

Eliza (Senior Advisor of Deloitte China Dr Eliza Chan), Duncan (Legislative Council member (Technology and Innovation) Mr Duncan Chiu), Robert (Hong Kong Digital Asset leader of Deloitte China, Mr Robert Lui), friends from the digital asset sector, ladies and gentlemen,

 The Forum today is very timely, as we are standing at a pivotal moment when economies worldwide are striving to chart the course for digital assets and oversight of their use. Hong Kong has been working diligently to stay ahead of the curve in building an ecosystem for the healthy development of the digital asset sector.

 As you know, back in 2022, we announced our first policy statement on digital assets, or virtual assets at the time, setting out our vision to create that comprehensive ecosystem under the principle of ""same activity, same risks, same regulation"". Then in June 2023, we put in place a licensing regime for digital asset trading platforms. Now we have a total of 11 licensees with local and international backgrounds. Nine exchange-traded funds with digital underlying assets have also been listed. In May this year, with the support of the Legislative Council, we enacted the Stablecoins Ordinance, making Hong Kong one of the few economies in the world to have a comprehensive law in place on stablecoin issuance. The Ordinance is scheduled to come into effect on August 1, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will begin to accept licence applications.

 This solid groundwork serves as a springboard for the next phase of digital asset development in Hong Kong. The ""LEAP"" framework or metaphor embodied in the second policy statement issued on June 26 conveys a proactive and forward-looking approach. To recap, ""L"" stands for legal and regulatory streamlining, ""E"" for expanding the suite of tokenised products, ""A"" for advancing use cases and cross-sectoral collaboration, and ""P"" is people and partnership development. These are linked to Hong Kong's unique advantages as an international financial centre, including our comprehensive legal system, sophisticated financial market and infrastructure, close connection with the international markets, and a wealth of professional talents.

 A lot of you are interested in the application scenarios or the ""E"" and ""A"" in the statement. A lot can be said on this. For now, I believe that as a well-developed financial market with a wide range of financial instruments and assets available for trading, Hong Kong has great potential to promote tokenisation of RWA (Real-World Assets). For example, Hong Kong is in a very good position to develop tokenised government bonds, building on our two landmark tokenised government green bond issuances in the past two years and Hong Kong's status as a leading bond issuance hub in Asia. The first batch totalling HK$800 million issued in 2023 was the first tokenised green bond issued by a government entity. The second batch, issued in 2024 denominated in Renminbi, Hong Kong dollars, Euro and US dollars and totalling close to HK$6 billion equivalent, was the world's first multi-currency digitally native green bonds. As announced in the 2025-26 Budget, the Government will regularise the issuance of tokenised bonds.

 I am sure that there are many good ideas about RWA out there in the marketplace. To encourage market participation in developing use cases, thanks to Cyberport, a funding scheme has been launched to support the development of high-impact applications with potential to serve as future use case benchmark.

 On the legal regulatory front or ""L"", right on the next day following the promulgation of the second policy statement, we launched a public consultation on the licensing regimes for digital asset dealing and custodian service providers. This is another big step in making the regulatory regime comprehensive, thus enabling us to manage the risks and harness the potential in different activities along the digital asset value chain, from issuance, trading and dealing, to post-trade custodian service. The two-month consultation period will end in late August. Do let us have your views.

 On the people and partnership front or ""P"", we value stakeholder engagement, and we walk the talk. At the policy level, the Financial Secretary is chairing the Task Force on Promoting Web3 Development. At the regulator level, the Securities and Futures Commission has established a consultative panel focusing on market and regulatory issues. The panel just held its second meeting yesterday. Fora like the one today will certainly provide useful feedback for our work.

 Our policy stance on digital assets is clear. We strive to embrace financial innovations so as to capture their potential benefits, but at the same time we need to put in risk management guardrails with emphasis on investor protection and user education. With this, we look forward to hearing your feedback, and I wish you fruitful discussions. Thank you."

行政長官在去年的《施政報告》宣布成立發展旅遊熱點工作組，由我擔任組長，並由文化體育及旅遊局局長擔任副組長。工作組的目標是希望加速發掘、推動旅遊熱點項目，透過不同政府單位、組織和持份者的協作，加快項目的起動，豐富香港的旅遊選項、增加香港作為旅遊城市的吸引力。

工作組自成立以來，收集了社會各界不同意見，並審視和討論了多個方案。經考慮後，我們在今年五月二十日公布九個在短期內推出的旅遊熱點項目，分別為：香港工業品牌旅遊、維園市集、添馬紫花風鈴木及簕杜鵑園、特色社區之香港龍城深度遊、特色社區之舊城中環深度遊、開放舊油麻地警署、紀律先鋒巡禮、「四山」旅遊及發展前紅磡鐵路貨運碼頭。

上述項目涵蓋的種類包括工業遊、文化遊、美景遊、深度遊、「打卡」遊、生態遊等，地理上則分布港九新界，體現「香港無處不旅遊」的特色。九個項目中，我們預計七個項目可於今年內推出。

由於九個項目的內容已載述在文件第4至18段，我不擬重複講述。我和同事樂意聽取委員的意見和回答各位的提問。多謝主席。"

他在抵埗後到訪韓國的中央銀行——韓國銀行，並與行長李昌鏞會面，就兩地、區域和全球的金融、貿易和經濟形勢、貨幣和利率政策、資金流向等議題交換意見。陳茂波在會面上向對方分享了香港的最新情況，特別是資金持續流入香港的金融體系，反映了國際投資者在當前國際形勢下對香港的信心。他指出，香港在「一國兩制」下維持自由開放的經濟和金融體系、聯繫匯率制度，香港內聯外通的獨特優勢和高度國際化的特色，正進一步匯聚更多國際參與者和資金到港，分享中國發展的機遇。香港的國際聯繫正不斷深化。

隨後，他到訪韓國主權投資基金——韓國投資公社，與社長及首席執行長朴日英等會面。韓國投資公社於二○○五年成立，負責管理該國部分的外匯儲備和其他公共資金，用以投資海外項目，目前其管理的資產超過2,000億美元。會面期間，雙方就多個共同關心的議題，包括投資市場的走向、資產配置策略、數字資產發展等，深入交換意見。

陳茂波向對方分享了香港經濟和金融市場最近的發展情況，以及連接中國與全球資本和投資者的重要角色。他指出，香港的資本市場和創投圈緊密連接內地的創科生態，最近新股市場興旺蓬勃，多家內地具領導地位的創科企業已來港或計劃來港上市，對國際投資者而言，香港是參與大中華地區創科機遇的高效門戶。他歡迎韓國資金更多利用香港市場配資國際投資，共同把握創科發展的龐大商機。

粵港澳三地在廣州聯辦十五運會和殘特奧會「開放共享、攜手並進」新聞發布會（附圖）,2025-07-08 18:30,2025-07-08 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800736.htm,"第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會）廣東賽區執行委員會、香港特別行政區政府全國運動會香港賽區統籌辦公室（全運會統籌辦）和十五運會和殘特奧會澳門賽區籌備辦公室今日（七月八日）在廣州舉行以「開放共享、攜手並進」為主題的新聞發布會，介紹十五運會和殘特奧會粵港澳三地賽區的賽事籌備情況，以及未來工作計劃。

十五運會組織委員會辦公室主任、廣東省人民政府副秘書長黃明忠、全運會統籌辦主任楊德強和十五運會及殘特奧會澳門賽區籌備辦公室主任潘永權分別在會上發言，分享粵港澳三地聯動辦會的階段成果。香港單車運動員黃金寶和澳門武術運動員李禕亦有出席簡介會，分享他們對十五運會的期盼。

黃明忠在發布會上表示，粵港澳三地攜手共同承辦十五運會，在國家體育總局、中央港澳辦等國家部委的指導下，建立了具開創性的粵港澳聯絡機制。通過高密度的溝通協商，在六大重點領域達成共識，包括跨境賽事、口岸通關、人車證件、食品安全、綠色辦賽和賽事日程。三地探索出一個「三地三同」的聯合辦賽模式，也就是「同頻溝通、同心決策、同步執行」。

楊德強表示：「香港賽區一直遵循『綠色、共享、開放、廉潔』的辦賽理念，按照『簡約、安全、精彩』的辦賽要求，嚴格做好預算管理，節約成本，控制賽事規模，務實做好各項籌備工作。」他又提到，由香港協辦的田徑馬拉松及公路自行車賽事將會是今屆全運會的亮點。兩個跨境賽事從比賽路線的設計到運動員、觀眾和車輛的快速通關，每一個細節都需要三地政府的共同籌劃和密切配合。這種跨地域的合作模式，不僅提升了大灣區的整體競爭力，亦同時促進大灣區民心交流。黃金寶表示，以港珠澳大橋作賽道舉辦跨境公路自行車賽具標誌性，風景不但優美，賽道亦充滿挑戰。

潘永權表示，全運會籌備工作已進入倒數階段，將與社會各界聯手做好賽事的組織工作，並加強營造全民全運的城市氛圍，包括繼續走訪社區和學校、聯動其他文、旅、體活動進行宣傳、推出澳門賽區特許紀念商品等。

粵港澳三地亦即場展示多款特許經營商品，並由設計師闡述其創作理念。香港賽區稍後將陸續在全港不同地區設銷售點，售賣十五運會和殘特奧會的紀念商品，包括具香港特色的特許紀念商品。

Enhancement Arrangements for Offshore RMB Bond Repurchase Business announced by HKMA,2025-07-08 17:15,2025-07-08 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800606.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (July 8) enhancements to the offshore RMB bond repurchase (repo) business (Note 1), to facilitate the participation of Northbound Bond Connect investors in repo business. In particular, the enhancements include:

1. Supporting the rehypothecation of bond collaterals during the repo period (Note 2):

The offshore RMB repo business has been well received by the market since its official launch on February 10, 2025. In this initial phase, the bond collaterals acquired by participating institutions are locked and managed by the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) platform and cannot be re-used during the repo period. In consultation with relevant Mainland authorities and taking into account industry feedback, we will allow rehypothecation of bond collateral during the repo period, bringing this into alignment with international market practice. The enhancement will facilitate more efficient use of collaterals, reduce the financing costs for market participants, and enhance the efficiency of liquidity management.

In particular, bond collaterals can be re-used during the repo period in four specific use cases: a) for re-use in offshore repo transactions; b) as collateral for the HKMA's RMB Liquidity Facility; c) as margin collateral at OTC Clearing Hong Kong Limited (OTCC); and d) for cash bond trading through Northbound Bond Connect. Participating institutions shall follow relevant policies and operational rules for the respective use cases when re-using the collateral (for instance, if the collateral is re-used in a new offshore repo transaction during the repo period, the participating institution should follow the latest arrangements of offshore RMB repo business as set out further below).

2. Supporting cross-currency repo (including HKD, USD and EUR):

At present, offshore RMB repo can only be settled in RMB. With the enhancement, settlement in other currencies (including HKD, USD and EUR) will be supported, with a view to facilitating participating institutions' multi-currency funding activities by collateralising onshore RMB bond holdings, enriching their liquidity management tools, and hence increasing the attractiveness of onshore bonds.

These two enhancement measures aim to adopt international market best practices and enhance operational efficiency. They will further expand the depth and breadth of the offshore repo market, improve the market-based mechanism for offshore RMB liquidity management, and broaden the use of onshore RMB bonds as collateral in the offshore market.

The above arrangements will be officially launched on August 25, 2025.

Latest Arrangements of Offshore RMB Repo Business

To facilitate the smooth implementation of the enhancement measures, the latest arrangements for offshore RMB repo transactions (including repo transactions conducted using bond collateral acquired through a repo transaction) are set out as follows:

1. Participating Institutions:

All existing Northbound Bond Connect investors, including CMU members and offshore investors with CMU sub-accounts opened through Hong Kong custodian banks that are CMU members.

2. Eligible Bonds:

Bonds held by participating institutions under Northbound Bond Connect, and bond collaterals acquired through offshore repo transactions, regardless of bond type.

3. Market Maker Arrangement:

The 11 Primary Liquidity Providers designated by the HKMA (Note 3) will serve as market makers. Each repo transaction must involve at least one of these market makers as a counterparty.

4. Transaction and Settlement Arrangements:

(a)Master Agreement: Participants may choose their own repo agreement template (e.g., Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA) or National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII)'s Bond Repurchase Master Agreement, etc.).

(b)Trading Arrangement: Transactions may be conducted:


bilaterally over-the-counter;
in the same manner as existing Northbound Bond Connect transactions, and via the linkage between the infrastructures in the onshore and offshore markets;
through offshore electronic trading platforms; or
through onshore electronic trading platform.


(c)Settlement Arrangement: Settlement will be completed under the Repo Service by CMU. Settlement currencies include RMB, HKD, USD and EUR.

5.Data Reporting:

Market makers are required to report repo transaction data (Note 4) to the HKMA on the same day of the transaction for market monitoring purpose. The HKMA will further communicate with the market makers to finalise the reporting requirements and submission channels.

The operational details for bond transfer and settlement will be announced by CMU separately. The HKMA will continue to closely monitor market conditions to ensure orderly market operations. The HKMA will also maintain communication with the industry and review and adjust the arrangements as appropriate to support the robust and sustainable development of offshore RMB business.

Note 1: The HKMA announced the launch of offshore RMB bond repo business on January 13, 2025 (please refer to the HKMA press release). This measure was implemented on February 10, 2025.

Note 2: Operational details will be announced by CMU later. Currently, the rehypothecation of bond collateral is only applicable to repo transactions settled in the Delivery versus Payment model. The timeline for CMU's tri-party repo service to support the rehypothecation of bond collateral will be notified separately in due course.

Note 3: Including 1) Agricultural Bank of China Limited, 2) Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited, 3) Bank of Communications Co., Ltd., 4) BNP Paribas, 5) China CITIC Bank International Limited, 6) China Construction Bank (Asia) Corporation Limited, 7) Citibank, N.A., 8) Hang Seng Bank Limited, 9) The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, 10) Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) Limited and 11) Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited.

Note 4: The specific information to be reported includes: names of the trading institutions (including both the repo party and the reverse repo party), total amount of funds borrowed by the repo party, bond name, bond code, repo term, total face value, repo rate, transaction/first settlement date, settlement amount, trading platform/means, default-related information etc."
金管局關於離岸人民幣債券回購業務的優化安排,2025-07-08 17:15,2025-07-08 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800614.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（七月八日）公布有關離岸人民幣債券回購業務（註一）的優化安排，以進一步便利「債券通」（北向通）投資者參與離岸人民幣債券回購業務。具體優化措施包括：

1.支持抵押品債券在回購期間再使用（註二）：

二○二五年二月十日正式推出以來，市場反應積極正面。業務初期，參與機構透過離岸回購交易取得的抵押債券只限於在債務工具中央結算系統（CMU）平台鎖定管理，在回購期間不能再使用。經總結落實以來的經驗和充分考慮市場建議，並與內地監管機構溝通，這次優化措施將按照國際慣例，允許抵押券在回購期間再使用，以提升抵押品使用效率，進一步降低市場機構的融資成本，提升流動性管理效率。

四個使用場景：（a）再次進行離岸回購交易；（b）作為金管局人民幣流動資金安排下的抵押品；（c）作為香港場外結算公司（OTCC）的履約抵押品和（d）通過「債券通」（北向通）進行現券交易。參與機構應遵守各業務場景的相關業務規則和操作規程進行抵押品再使用（例如：若抵押品在回購期間再使用於新的離岸回購交易，則應遵循下述關於離岸人民幣債券回購業務的最新安排要求）。

2.支持外幣結算（包括港元、美元和歐元）：

離岸人民幣回購業務僅限於以人民幣單幣種結算。經本次優化後，可進一步支持多幣種外幣結算，包括港元、美元和歐元，以便利參與機構按實際需要，以持有的在岸人民幣債券持倉進行多幣種資金融通，豐富流動性管理工具，也有助於提升在岸債券的吸引力。

這兩項優化措施旨在對標國際市場慣例、提升市場操作便利，以進一步拓展離岸回購市場的深度和廣度，完善離岸人民幣流動性市場化安排機制，並提升在岸人民幣債券在離岸市場作為抵押品的使用。

上述優化措施將於二○二五年八月二十五日正式啓動。

離岸人民幣債券回購業務的最新安排要求

為便於優化措施的順利推出，現就離岸人民幣債券回購交易，包括利用通過另一宗回購交易取得的抵押債券進行的回購交易，最新安排說明如下：

一、參與機構：

所有已入市的「債券通」（北向通）投資者（包括CMU成員和透過香港託管行CMU成員開立債券通子帳戶的離岸投資者）。

二、合資格債券：

參與機構在「債券通」（北向通）下持有的債券，以及透過離岸回購交易取得的抵押券，不限券種。

三、做市商安排：

由金管局指定的11家一級流動性提供銀行（註三）作為做市商。每筆回購交易應至少有一方交易對手是做市商機構。

四、交易及結算安排：

（a）主協議：允許機構間自行選擇回購協議文本（例如全球回購主協議（GMRA）或中國銀行間市場交易商協會（NAFMII）的債券回購交易主協議等）。

（b）交易方式：可以通過以下方式開展交易：

場外雙邊交易；
採用「債券通」（北向通）交易方式，透過境內外基礎設施聯通方式；
透過境外電子交易平台；或
透過境內電子交易平台。


（c）結算安排：在CMU的回購服務下完成。結算幣種包括人民幣、港元、美元和歐元。

五、信息數據報送：

做市商須於回購交易日當天向金管局報送交易數據（註四），作市場監察用途。金管局將與做市商進一步溝通信息報送的要求和途徑。

有關債券過戶和結算安排的操作詳情將由CMU稍後公布。金管局將繼續密切監察市場情況，確保市場運作穩定有序；並與業界保持溝通，適時檢視進一步優化調整措施，以支持離岸人民幣業務的穩健蓬勃發展。

註一：金管局於二○二五年一月十三日公布推出離岸人民幣債券回購業務（相關詳情請參考金管局新聞稿）。該業務於二○二五年二月十日正式上線。

註二：目前只有以貨銀兩訖模式為結算方式的回購交易可以實現抵押品債券在回購期間再使用，詳情將由CMU稍後公布。CMU的第三方回購服務安排具體何時可以支持抵押品債券再使用將另行通知。

駐成都辦主任袁嘉諾、省港澳辦主任姚紅娟，以及省科協副主席呂建軍首先向來賓和傳媒致歡迎詞。袁嘉諾表示：「國家『十四五』規劃明確支持香港建設國際創新科技中心。陝西省是國家重要的科技工業基地，在能源化工、裝備製造、航空航天等領域實力雄厚。香港和陝西均非常重視創科產業發展，近年來高層互訪頻繁。期待通過深度對接讓香港在稅制、金融、全球網絡等方面的優勢，與陝西的產業根基和創新活力結合，實現『雙向奔赴』。」

姚紅娟亦表示，將積極推動並不斷深化陝港兩地經貿投資，特別是科技創新和新質生產力代表產業的合作交流，協助兩地企業充分把握發展機遇，實現優勢互補。呂建軍隨後於現場致辭。

本次交流會亮點之一，是香港投資推廣署與西安高新區管委會於活動現場簽署合作備忘錄，攜手支持陝西創科企業借港出海，拓展國際市場，標誌陝港兩地在推動中西部地區企業國際化發展方面邁出堅實一步。

西安高新區是國務院首批批准成立的國家級高新區之一。二○二四年，在國家高新區綜合評價中排名全國第五位、位居中西部第一位。區內重點發展光電子資訊、智慧製造、生物醫藥、汽車、新材料新能源等創新產業，成功建立汽車產業、電子資訊兩個千億級產業集群。目前，該區已發展成全球規模最大的閃存晶片生產基地及新能源汽車生產基地。

根據合作備忘錄，西安高新區管委會將鼓勵區內企業利用香港作為拓展海外業務的基地。投資推廣署將提供香港營商環境和政策資訊，以及就企業在港投資和營運提供支援。此次簽署合作備忘錄標誌雙方將建立穩定協作機制，結合香港國際金融中心的獨特優勢與西安高新區的創新動能，助企業連接全球資源，搶佔國際市場先機。

投資推廣署華西地區企業出海專組／招商引才／投資推廣總監干杉立，與西安高新區科技創新局局長高雲天分別代表香港投資推廣署與西安高新區管委會簽署該備忘錄。干杉立簽約後表示：「在發展新質生產力、貢獻國家高品質發展方面，陝港有極大的合作機遇。作為連接內地與國際市場的重要橋樑，香港一直致力為內地創新企業提供全方位支援。希望進一步發揮兩地互補優勢，協助園區內的優質企業借港出海，共同開拓創新合作新機遇。」

投資推廣署創新及科技總裁黃煒卓在推廣香港創科機遇主題演講時表示：「我們擁有多項發展創科的優勢，包括頂尖學術研究與人才庫、世界級研發基礎設施、健全的知識產權保護，以及特區政府的堅定支持。二○二四年，投資推廣署協助的創科公司數量增至120間在香港拓展業務，是該署支援最多的行業，反映出國際對香港創科發展的信心與肯定，也進一步印證香港作為『雙向門戶』的戰略角色。近期，香港創科領域在多方面值得關注，例如首批低空經濟「監管沙盒」試點項目在香港落實，成為推動香港發展的嶄新動力。另外，香港新藥審批機制更新，加速新藥上市進程。我希望陝西省高新科技企業能把握香港多元化機遇，拓展海外市場。」

交流會亦邀請港深創新及科技園有限公司租賃及營運部高級經理談飛，與香港理工大學研究及創新事務處副總監趙培，分享並推介香港創科中心機遇以及香港高校科研創新賦能新質生產力等主題。陝西省西咸新區科技創新和新經濟局副局長韓萍同時分享陝西省創新中心的最新發展。

The event was also co-organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Chengdu (CDETO), the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government's Shaanxi Liaison Unit, Shaanxi Province Xixian New Area Development and Construction Management Committee, and the Xi'an High-Tech Industries Development Zone Management Committee.
  
  The Director of the CDETO, Mr Enoch Yuen; the Director-General of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Shaanxi Provincial Government, Ms Yao Hongjuan; and Vice President of the Shaanxi Association for Science and Technology Mr Lv Jianjun delivered welcome remarks to guests and the media. Mr Yuen said, ""The National 14th Five-Year Plan explicitly designates Hong Kong as an international innovation and technology hub, while Shaanxi serves as a key national base for technology and industry, with strong capabilities in energy and chemical engineering, equipment manufacturing, and aerospace, among others. Both Hong Kong and Shaanxi place great importance on the development of the innovation and technology industry, and frequent high-level exchanges between the two places have continued to deepen in recent years. We look forward to deeper collaboration, leveraging Hong Kong's strengths in taxation, finance, and global connectivity, while combining them with Shaanxi's strong industrial foundation and innovative vitality, to achieve a mutually beneficial partnership.""
  
  Ms Yao stated that efforts will be made to actively promote and deepen economic, trade, and investment co-operation between Shaanxi and Hong Kong, particularly in the fields of innovation and technology, as well as new quality productive forces. These efforts aim to help enterprises in both regions seize development opportunities and achieve complementary advantages. Mr Lv also delivered remarks at the event.
  
  One of the key highlights of the event was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between InvestHK and the Xi'an High-Tech Industries Development Zone Management Committee, marking a solid step forward for Shaanxi and Hong Kong in promoting the international development of enterprises in the central and western regions.
  
  Xi'an High-tech Zone is one of the first national high-tech zones approved by the State Council.

  Under the MOU, the Xi'an High-Tech Industries Development Zone Management Committee will encourage enterprises in the zone to utilise Hong Kong as a base for expanding overseas business. InvestHK will provide enterprises with information on the business environment and policies in Hong Kong, as well as support services for companies investing and operating in Hong Kong. The signing of this MOU establishes a structured collaboration framework, combining Hong Kong's unique strengths as an international financial centre and Xi'an High-Tech Zone's innovation capabilities to empower enterprises in accessing global resources efficiently and seizing early opportunities in international markets.
  
  The Head of the Go Global Unit/Business and Talent Attraction/Investment Promotion of Western China of InvestHK, Mr Jason Gan, and the Director of the Science and Technology Innovation Bureau of the Xi'an High-Tech Industries Development Zone, Mr Gao Yuntian, signed the memorandum of co-operation on behalf of their respective sides. Mr Gan said after the signing, ""There are tremendous opportunities for co-operation between Shaanxi and Hong Kong in developing new quality productive forces and contributing to China's high-quality development. As a vital bridge between the Mainland and international markets, Hong Kong has long been committed to providing comprehensive support for Mainland innovation-driven enterprises. We hope to further leverage the complementary advantages of the two places to assist high-quality enterprises in the zone to go global via Hong Kong, and work together to explore new innovative co-operation.""
  
  The Head of Innovation & Technology of InvestHK, Mr Andy Wong, delivered a keynote speech and highlighted Hong Kong's competitive edge in the I&T sector. ""We possess a number of competitive advantages in developing innovation and technology, including world-class academic research and talent, cutting-edge R&D infrastructure, robust intellectual property protection, and the strong support of the HKSAR Government. In 2024, InvestHK supported 120 innovation and technology companies to set up or expand in Hong Kong, making it the top sector among those we assisted. This reflects the international community's confidence in and recognition of Hong Kong's I&T development, and further affirms the city's strategic role as a two-way platform between the Mainland and global markets. Hong Kong's innovation and technology sector has recently made remarkable progress in several areas. For example, the first batch of regulatory sandbox pilot projects for the low-altitude economy has been launched, serving as a new engine for Hong Kong's future development. In addition, the city's new drug approval mechanism has been updated to accelerate the market entry of new pharmaceuticals. I sincerely hope that I&T enterprises in Shaanxi will seize the diverse opportunities offered by Hong Kong to expand into international markets,"" he said.

  Senior Manager of the Leasing and Operations Department of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park Limited Mr Tandy Tan and Associate Director of the Research and Innovation Office of Hong Kong Polytechnic University Mr Victor Zhao also shared the opportunities of the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Center and highlighted Hong Kong's R&D capabilities in empowering new quality productive forces raised from Hong Kong universities. Deputy Director of the Science, Technology Innovation and New Economy Bureau, Shaanxi Province Xixian New Area Ms Han Ping also shared the latest developments on Shaanxi's I&T industry construction centre.
  
  This event featured a panel discussion with industry leaders from professional services in Hong Kong, especially in financial professional services. Guest speakers from Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, HSBC and Deloitte Tax shared insights on how Hong Kong's financial and professional services can accelerate Mainland firms' global expansion.
  
  The seminar included a dedicated exchange session to provide on-site consulting services for corporate representatives interested in expanding to Hong Kong. The event attracted 190 representatives from Shaanxi enterprises, institutions and local media."

霍震霆會長（中國香港體育協會暨奧林匹克委員會會長）、衞校長（香港浸會大學校長衞炳江）、周博士（中國香港大專體育協會會長代表、香港樹仁大學行政副校長周德生博士）、侯團長（中國香港大專體育協會2023-2025大學生運動會籌委會主席暨團長侯耀忠）、各位嘉賓、各位運動員、各位朋友：

大家午安。我今日很高興出席授旗儀式，為即將出戰第32屆世界大學生運動會的健兒壯行助威。

大學生運動會是僅次於奧運會的綜合性世界運動會，歷屆比賽均是高手雲集、競爭激烈，今屆比賽亦不例外。來自150個國家及地區的頂尖學生運動員，將會齊聚德國萊茵魯爾，在18個運動項目展開連場精彩的對決，實在令人非常期待。

今年，中國香港將會派出75名健將出戰10個項目。經過長年累月的刻苦訓練，我相信各位運動員早已蓄勢待發。我今日看見你們每一個精神抖擻、鬥志高昂，相信你們抵達德國後，必定會迅速適應當地的時差、氣候和環境，以最佳狀態迎戰各地好手，力爭超越上屆四金、一銀、七銅的成績。

憑藉「一國兩制」的獨特優勢，在這次大學生運動會中，香港運動員能夠以「中國香港」的名義征戰國際體育賽場，實在意義非凡。希望你們珍惜和把握國家為我們提供的寶貴機會，展現精湛的技術和永不言敗的精神，將我們的香港獅子山下精神發揮到極致，為香港和祖國爭光。

特區政府在今年三月完成精英體育資助制度的檢討，並公布由四月起上調每月資助金額，減輕精英運動員的經濟壓力，讓他們更專注於訓練，向體壇高峰邁進。未來，政府會持續為本地運動員創造更優越的條件，助力他們在地區及國際賽場上發光發亮。

在此，我衷心感謝中國香港大專體育協會、各所大專院校、香港體育學院，以及教練、醫療團隊和後勤人員的悉心努力。你們的悉心栽培和鼎力支援，讓本地體壇得以新秀輩出，為長遠發展奠下良好根基。當然，我們也要多謝香港賽馬會對於體育事業的鼎力支持，希望他們會再接再勵，令運動員有更好的發揮。

今日授予代表團的旗幟，不僅是國家地區的象徵，更承載着全港市民的期許。希望各位運動員發揮出色，旗開得勝，滿載而歸！多謝各位。"
《2025年立法會（權力及特權）（修訂）條例草案》刊憲,2025-07-08 16:15,2025-07-08 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800369.htm,"​政府今日（七月八日）在憲報刊登《2025年立法會（權力及特權）（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）。

因應立法會完善立法會議員履職制度、引入《立法會議員守則》（《守則》）和對《議事規則》作出相應修訂，政府將按立法會建議提交《條例草案》，以修訂《立法會（權力及特權）條例》（第382章）（《條例》），向因違反《守則》而根據《議事規則》被暫停立法會職務的立法會議員施加財政處分。

政府發言人說︰「政府支持立法會完善議員履職制度的建議。現時《條例》有關立法會議員在停職期間須扣起其酬金及津貼的規定，只適用於因議員作出極不檢點行為的情況。根據立法會建議，議員日後因違反《守則》並根據《議事規則》被暫停立法會職務，其停職期間的酬金及津貼同樣須被扣起。修訂亦為立法會提供彈性，以處理立法會將來因根據《議事規則》所批准的其他理由被暫停立法會職務的議員須扣起酬金及津貼的情況。《條例草案》如獲立法會通過，會與《守則》和經修訂的《議事規則》一併於第八屆立法會起生效。」

「政府充分肯定立法會就加強自我監督和自我完善，並增加立法會運作的透明度而採取的措施。《條例》的修訂有助立法會不斷求進，為『愛國者治港』創造更大價值。」

《條例草案》將於明日（七月九日）提交立法會作首讀。"

In light of the Legislative Council (LegCo)'s improvement to the system on the performance of duties by LegCo Members, the introduction of the Code for Members of the Legislative Council, and corresponding amendments to be made to the Rules of Procedure (RoP), in accordance with the LegCo's proposal, the Government will introduce the Bill, which aims to amend the Legislative Council (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance (Cap. 382) to provide for imposing financial penalties on LegCo Members suspended under the RoP from the service of the LegCo due to a breach of the Code.

""The Government supports the LegCo's proposal on improving the system on the performance of duties by Members. At present, the deprivation of LegCo Members' remuneration and allowance in respect of the period of suspension provided under the Ordinance is only applicable to cases of engaging in grossly disorderly conduct. According to the LegCo's proposal, in future, Members who have breached the Code and are suspended under the RoP will also be subject to the same deprivation of remuneration and allowance. The amendments will also provide flexibility to the LegCo to cater for deprivation of remuneration and allowance of Members suspended from the service of the LegCo for other reasons under the RoP as approved by the LegCo in future. Once the Bill is passed by the LegCo, it will take effect starting from the Eighth-Term LegCo in tandem with the Code and the amended RoP.

  ""The Government fully appreciates the initiatives taken by the LegCo to enhance self-regulation and self-improvement as well as transparency of the LegCo's operation. The amendments to the Ordinance will facilitate the LegCo in striving for continual improvement, thereby optimising the contribution of 'patriots administering Hong Kong',"" a Government spokesman said.

The Bill will be introduced into the LegCo for first reading tomorrow (July 9)."

海關透過情報分析及風險評估，在六月二十七日抽查一艘由香港出發前往澳門的內河船。經查驗後，海關在該艘船上檢獲大批懷疑走私貨物，包括約五十七萬件懷疑藥劑製品、約一千五百公斤乾魚翅、約四十七公斤水煙膏、約四十二公斤燕窩、約三十八公斤雪茄，以及一千三百八十部手提電話。

案件仍在調查中，不排除會有人被捕。

海關是專責打擊走私的政府部門，一直全方位積極打擊各類走私活動。海關的執法行動絕不鬆懈，將繼續嚴厲打擊海上走私活動，積極運用風險管理及情報主導執法策略，適時開展針對性的反走私行動，全力遏止相關活動。

走私屬嚴重罪行，根據《進出口條例》，任何人輸入或輸出未列艙單貨物，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑走私活動。"
Hong Kong Customs detects smuggling case by river trade vessel involving goods worth about $34 million (with photo),2025-07-08 16:05,2025-07-08 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800632.htm,"Hong Kong Customs on June 27 detected a suspected smuggling case involving a river trade vessel. A large batch of suspected smuggled goods with a total estimated market value of about $34 million was seized.

Through intelligence analysis and risk assessment, a river trade vessel departing from Hong Kong for Macao was selected for inspection on June 27. Upon examination, Customs officers onboard the vessel found a large batch of suspected smuggled goods, including about 570 000 suspected pharmaceutical products, about 1 500 kilograms of dried shark fins, about 47kg of shisha tobacco, about 42kg of bird's nests, about 38kg of cigars and 1 380 mobile phones.

An investigation is ongoing. The likelihood of arrests is not ruled out.

Being a government department primarily responsible for tackling smuggling activities, Customs has long been combating various smuggling activities on all fronts. Customs will keep up its enforcement action and continue to resolutely combat sea smuggling activities through proactive risk management and intelligence-based enforcement strategies, and carry out targeted anti-smuggling operations at suitable times to crack down on relevant activities.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

尊敬的李永勝副特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署副特派員）、蔡冠深主席（國際品牌科學院董事會主席、粵港澳大灣區企業家聯盟主席）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！我很高興今天與各位聚首一堂，共同見證香港首屆世界品牌大會開幕，同時慶祝國際品牌科學院正式落戶香港。

習近平主席強調國家必須因地制宜發展新質生產力，多次對品牌建設作出重要指示，包括要推動：「中國製造」向「中國創造」轉變、「中國速度」向「中國質量」轉變、「中國產品」向「中國品牌」轉變，打造更多叫得響的中國品牌。

品牌超越商業機構的商標符號，更是承載意念的文化圖騰。當前，保護主義破壞環球經貿秩序，世界正重新構建經濟新格局。國家企業和機構推出國際知名的品牌，可以展現中國企業的創新能力和市場優勢，更能讓世界了解國家發展新質生產力的堅定決心和雄厚實力。

國家「十四五」規劃提出要開展中國品牌創建行動，保護發展中華老字號，提升自主品牌影響力和競爭力，並率先在消費品領域培育一批高端品牌。

今年是「十四五」規劃收官之年。幾年以來，國家在服裝、家庭用品、運動用品等傳統產業推陳出新，在創科領域發展更是一日千里，在通訊設備、新能源汽車，以至無人機等表現都讓世界矚目，成功打造出一個又一個國際知名品牌，很多更處於全球市場的領導地位。

這些響噹噹的中國品牌說明，成功建立自家品牌，一方面能為企業增值和提高利潤，推動國家經濟持續發展，同時更可以提升全社會的創新文化，鼓勵產業通過發展品牌，推出更有特色的產品，提升競爭力。

香港中西文化薈萃，除了擁有很多自身發展的國際知名品牌，更一直都是全球品牌匯聚的重要平台。多年以來，很多內地新興消費品牌，包括特色餐飲、影視娛樂、專業服務，以至新能源產業，都首選香港作為企業「出海」的第一站。

香港在「一國兩制」下擁有「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的獨特優勢，我們與內地山水相連、同根同源，更具備源遠流長的法治傳統、國際接軌的監管制度、自由方便的經濟環境、高效專業的金融服務、多元包容的文化氛圍，聚集環球頂級機構和中外旅客，可以發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，服務更多內地品牌走向全球，為品牌強國建設作出貢獻。

特區政府積極維護香港健全有效的保護知識產權制度，保障專利、版權及商標等，打造香港成為區域知識產權貿易中心，為內地和海外的品牌交易提供更好的監管環境。

同時，特區政府全力支援香港企業開發自家品牌、擴大業務範圍。其中，我們通過「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」資助企業品牌擁抱創新，開展更廣闊市場。香港貿易發展局舉辦的「香港好物節」和不同展覽推廣活動，在線上線下全方位推介香港優質的商品和服務。

過往，品牌是口碑；今天，品牌是體驗；明天，品牌將是創新與科技的結合。我感謝主辦機構對推動品牌發展的不懈努力，特區政府會與各位繼續攜手合作，通過品牌建設說好中國故事，說好香港故事。

最後，我祝願今天的大會圓滿成功，各位工作順利。謝謝大家。"

這些響噹噹的中國品牌說明，成功建立自家品牌，一方面能為企業增值和提高利潤，推動國家經濟持續發展，同時更可以提升全社會的創新文化，鼓勵產業通過發展品牌，推出更有特色的產品，提升競爭力。

香港中西文化薈萃，除了擁有很多自身發展的國際知名品牌，更一直都是全球品牌匯聚的重要平台。多年以來，很多內地新興消費品牌，包括特色餐飲、影視娛樂、專業服務，以至新能源產業，都首選香港作為企業「出海」的第一站。

香港在「一國兩制」下擁有「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的獨特優勢，我們與內地山水相連、同根同源，更具備源遠流長的法治傳統、國際接軌的監管制度、自由方便的經濟環境、高效專業的金融服務、多元包容的文化氛圍，聚集環球頂級機構和中外旅客，可以發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，服務更多內地品牌走向全球，為品牌強國建設作出貢獻。

特區政府積極維護香港健全有效的保護知識產權制度，保障專利、版權及商標等，打造香港成為區域知識產權貿易中心，為內地和海外的品牌交易提供更好的監管環境。

同時，特區政府全力支援香港企業開發自家品牌、擴大業務範圍。其中，我們通過「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」資助企業品牌擁抱創新，開展更廣闊市場。香港貿易發展局舉辦的「香港好物節」和不同展覽推廣活動，在線上線下全方位推介香港優質的商品和服務。

過往，品牌是口碑；今天，品牌是體驗；明天，品牌將是創新與科技的結合。我感謝主辦機構對推動品牌發展的不懈努力，特區政府會與各位繼續攜手合作，通過品牌建設說好中國故事，說好香港故事。

最後，我祝願今天的大會圓滿成功，各位工作順利。謝謝大家。"

環境及生態局局長在立法會食物安全及環境衞生事務委員會會議就都市農業開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-08 15:10,2025-07-08 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800587.htm,"以下是環境及生態局局長謝展寰今日（七月八日）下午在立法會食物安全及環境衞生事務委員會會議，就都市農業的開場發言：

多謝主席、各位委員。

發展都市農業是《漁農業可持續發展藍圖》的其中一個策略。都市農場一般會採用較先進的設施進行「多層耕作」，生產優質、新鮮和減少碳足跡的農產品；同時藉着在農場內舉行的教育活動為市民提供耕作體驗，讓農業與城市化發展並存。

政府正多管齊下協助業界發展都市農業。在規劃方面，我們會把握北部都會區和其他新發展區的發展機遇，在規劃階段加入都市農業元素，並善用合適的都市空間和政府建築物天台作都市農業用途。去年，政府已獲城市規劃委員會同意，修訂「休憩用地」的法定圖則詞彙釋義，以涵蓋「都市農場」用途。漁護署（漁農自然護理署）亦正積極探討將都市農業設定為綠色建築的指標之一，以鼓勵具商業元素的私人發展項目加入都市農業。

在物色合適的政府場地設立都市農場方面，我們已在馬鞍山西沙路花園撥出用地設立首個都市農場試驗項目。我們亦會在合適的公眾街市設置現代化水耕農場暨攤檔，推廣「現耕現賣」的概念。

接下來，我請漁護署助理署長馬惠忠用投影片介紹討論文件。多謝各位。"

Ombudsman briefs Legislative Council Members on work results in 2024-25 (with photo),2025-07-08 14:16,2025-07-08 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800344.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (July 8) attended an annual meeting with the Legislative Council (LegCo) and briefed members on the progress and results of the Office of The Ombudsman's work in 2024-25. Looking forward, the Office will drive positive change in public administration, especially by streamlining workflow and enhancing efficiency to bring about further improvement in public administration. Mr Chan also exchanged constructive views with LegCo Members on matters of mutual concern.

At the meeting, Mr Chan mentioned that in response to the motherland's expectations of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the Office will stay bold in reform, dare to break new ground, and innovate continuously. In the reporting year, the Office championed three strategic focuses and achieved satisfactory results in various areas. Mr Chan said, ""On the front of mediation, the Office achieved unprecedented results during the reporting year, concluding an all-time high of 555 cases involving no or only minor maladministration."" Based on the motto of ""responding to people's needs"", the Office helped the complainants out of their predicament speedily and amicably through mediation, while the departments could also review internal procedures and make improvements, thereby enhancing the standards of public administration. The results were encouraging as the Office's mediation work was highly commended by both complainants and departments.

Interdepartmental collaboration is another strategic focus of the Office. At the meeting, Mr Chan elaborated that after analysing the interdepartmental collaboration cases handled over the past, positive impact was observed in four major areas: clarifying the demarcation of responsibilities, grasping the crux of the matter, facilitating direct communication and experience sharing among departments, and launching joint operations. The Office has introduced a new series featuring stories of good people and good deeds on social media and its website, showcasing mediation and interdepartmental collaboration closely related to people's livelihood and highlighting the results brought about by complaint handling.

During the reporting year, the Office spared no effort in advocating a positive complaint culture through exchange meetings, publicity campaigns, education initiatives and commendation schemes. Not only are the public encouraged to participate in social issues and voice their opinions in a constructive manner, but departments and organisations are also urged to serve the public with open-mindedness. Mr Chan firmly believes that fostering constructive suggestions and positive feedback is conducive to the promotion of good governance.

Mr Chan highlighted at the meeting several direct investigation (DI) operations widely concerned by the Government, professions and the community, including regulation of occupational safety and health in construction industry, combating abuse of public housing resources, and the arrangements for recovery, refurbishment and reallocation of public housing rental flats. A poignant DI operation was conducted into the provision of public services relating to after-death arrangements. During the reporting year, the Office made 148 recommendations to government departments or public organisations in DI operation reports. Together with the 106 recommendations made in full investigation reports, the total number of 254 recommendations soared by 37 per cent over that in 2023-24 and hit a record high in the recent five years.

The Office completed a reorganisation in July, under which it has streamlined the directorate establishment from a three-tier to a two-tier directorate structure by freezing the vacancy of Deputy Ombudsman. Instead, three Assistant Ombudsmen, all reporting directly to the Ombudsman, are appointed to head three major divisions, namely the Complaints Investigation Division, the Direct Investigation Division, and the Complaints Assessment and Support Division. The Office has deployed resources more flexibly to increase the number of Direct Investigation Teams from two to three, augment the staffing for complaints assessment, and streamline the complement of Complaints Investigation Teams and administrative and support staff. Mr Chan said, ""The Office will adhere to the strategy of training and internal promotion to cultivate a contingent of experienced and competent investigation officers and support staff that are dedicated to our country and Hong Kong.""

Separately, Mr Chan reported the Office's international liaison work, including hosting the International Ombudsman Summit 2024 and The Ombudsman's 35th Anniversary Reception Ceremony in December last year. The event was supported and commended by the Central Government, the HKSAR Government and international counterparts, and widely reported by the media. Around 140 Mainland and overseas participants from about 40 countries and regions across six continents attended the Summit. The Office also signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Bilateral Cooperation with representatives from eight countries and regions across five continents, demonstrating Hong Kong's important role as a ""super connector"".

The Office actively participated in international affairs. In addition to being the Secretary of the Asian Ombudsman Association, Mr Chan was appointed earlier this year as the Chairman of the Standing By-laws Committee and a member of the United Nations and International Cooperation Working Group under the International Ombudsman Institute (IOI) respectively. In May, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Australasian and Pacific Region of the IOI. Mr Chan pledged to continue playing an active role on international co-operation platforms, presenting to global audiences a good story about Hong Kong from stability to prosperity under ""one country, two systems"", and leveraging the unique position of having strong support from the motherland and close connections to the world. Furthermore, the Office will maintain a close relationship with its Mainland counterparts.

Looking forward, the Office will perform the gatekeeping function under The Ombudsman Ordinance to focus resources on those complaints that require assistance. It will press ahead with promoting mediation to redress public grievances, step up DI operations and make pragmatic and effective recommendations and observations, especially on streamlining workflow and enhancing efficiency to bring about improvement in public administration. Mr Chan also remarked that the preparations for establishing the Hong Kong International Ombudsman Academy are in full swing. The Academy's first exchange session on mediation is scheduled for August 25, 2025. In line with Mr Chan's firm belief in ""prevention is better than cure"", the Academy will endeavour to instil the concept of ""maladministration prevention"" in public officers to enhance their vigilance and take precautions against maladministration. This also marks a new milestone of the Office in driving positive change in public administration."
​申訴專員向立法會議員報告二○二四／二五年度工作成果（附圖）,2025-07-08 14:16,2025-07-08 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800346.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出︰

申訴專員陳積志今日（七月八日）出席與立法會議員舉行的年度會議，簡介二○二四／二五年度申訴專員公署的工作進展和成果，未來公署會積極推動公共行政變革，聚焦簡化流程、提升效率，從而進一步改善公共行政。陳積志在會上亦與立法會議員就共同關注的課題交換意見，進行建設性交流。

在會議上，陳積志提到公署呼應國家對香港特別行政區（特區）的期盼：勇於改革、敢於破局、不斷創新，公署在二○二四／二五年度訂下三個策略性方向，在多方面的工作取得滿意成果。陳積志說︰「在調解方面，公署取得史無前例的佳績。在二○二四／二五年度，公署成功調解了555宗不涉行政失當或只涉及輕微行政失當的個案，刷新了記錄。」公署按「民有所呼，我有所應」的原則，以調解形式迅速及圓滿解決申訴人的困擾，部門亦可檢視內部程序及作出改善，提升公共行政水平。公署的調解工作更獲得申訴人及部門的高度評價，成效令人鼓舞。

公署同樣關注跨部門協作。陳積志在會議上闡釋公署分析過往處理的跨部門協作個案，發現成效主要有四個方面，包括釐清權責、找出問題的癥結、促成部門直接溝通和分享經驗，以及採取聯合行動。公署在社交媒體及網站推出全新的「好人好事」系列，精選調解及跨部門協作個案，撰寫與市民切身相關的故事，讓市民了解向公署申訴的成果。

公署於二○二四／二五年度全力宣揚「正面看申訴」的理念，並積極透過交流、宣傳教育及嘉許計劃，鼓勵市民以建設性態度參與公共事務和提出意見，同時亦倡導部門及機構持開明、開放的態度服務市民。陳積志深信以正面態度提出建議，有助推動良政善治。

陳積志在會議上重點分享了幾個主動調查行動的例子，包括廣受政府、業界和社會重視的建造業職業安全及健康的監管、打擊濫用公屋資源及收回、翻新及重新編配公屋單位，以及引起市民共鳴的辦理先人過世手續相關的公共服務。就主動調查行動報告，公署在二○二四／二五年度向政府部門或機構提出148項改善建議，連同106項由全面調查報告提出的建議，公署合共提出254項建議，數目較二○二三／二四年度的建議總數大幅增加了37%，更是近五年的新高。

公署在七月重整組織架構，包括將首長級職位編制由三層架構精簡為兩層，凍結副申訴專員的空缺，改由三名助理申訴專員分掌三大部門——申訴調查部、主動調查部，以及申訴評審及支援部，直接向申訴專員匯報；主動調查隊的編制亦由兩隊增加至三隊，並增添了申訴評審工作的人手，精簡申訴調查隊和行政及支援人員的編制，更靈活調配資源。陳積志說︰「公署會繼續透過培訓及內部晉升，建立一支富經驗、有能力、愛國愛港的調查及支援團隊。」

另外，陳積志亦匯報了公署在國際層面的工作概況，包括去年十二月籌辦的國際申訴專員高峰論壇2024，以及公署成立35周年的慶祝大會。活動獲中央政府、特區政府及國際同儕充分肯定及高度讚賞，並獲傳媒廣泛報道。高峰論壇共有約140位來自六大洲約40個國家及地區的內地及海外參加者。公署亦與來自五大洲八個國家及地區的代表，簽署雙邊合作諒解備忘錄，彰顯香港作為「超級聯繫人」的重要地位。

公署積極參與國際事務，陳積志除擔任亞洲申訴專員協會秘書長，亦在今年初分別成為國際申訴專員協會轄下章程常務委員會主席及聯合國及國際合作工作小組的委員，以及在五月獲選為國際申訴專員協會澳太區分會的常任理事。陳積志表示，公署將繼續參與國際合作平台，在世界舞台上說好香港在｢一國兩制｣下「由治及興」的好故事，達致背靠祖國，聯通世界的目標。同時，亦會與內地的相關機構保持緊密聯繫。

展望未來，公署會按《申訴專員條例》把好關，集中資源處理需要協助的申訴；繼續着力推行調解為市民解困；加強主動調查行動，提出務實有效的建議和觀點，聚焦簡化流程、提升效率，從而改善公共行政。陳積志亦提到公署設立香港國際申訴專員學院的籌備工作如火如荼，學院已落實在今年八月二十五日舉辦第一場調解分享會。陳積志深信「預防勝於治療」，學院往後會着力向公職人員灌輸「防範行政失當」的概念，以提高他們的警覺性，避免行政失當。這亦標誌着公署在推動公共行政積極變革方面的一個新的里程碑。"
