​立法會：運輸及物流局局長根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》及《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》動議的兩項擬議決議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 19:15,2025-07-30 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000711.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》及《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》動議的兩項擬議決議案的總結發言：

主席：

感謝各位議員剛才表達的寶貴意見，我一一細心聆聽，現在此作一個綜合的回應。

首先，今日就這兩項動議，我們的目的很簡單、很直接，就是提升道路安全和維持路面的交通暢順。在香港，道路的空間實在是有限，有私家車亦有商用車，之後我會再談及商用車。剛才有多位議員都提到自己或其他從社會上聽到的意見，作為駕駛者，當去到某些地區想泊車然後消費、吃東西，或有一些夜間的經濟活動，正因為某些地區在某些時段會有特別多的私家車使用者到訪。即使那個區域有兩條或三條行車線，亦可能會因為車位有限，有私家車或會停泊而佔用了兩條行車線，導致只得一條行車線供其他人使用，造成交通擠塞，這些情況現時在社會不時出現。

今日我聽到多位議員都對特區政府提出這個就一些定額罰款作出水平調整的動議，大部分都表示認同和理解，尤其是對於調整19項有關道路安全和導致交通擠塞相關的一些罰款額，多位議員剛才的發言都表示認同，亦都認為有需要增加阻嚇力。其中有個別議員提及希望做到有效的交通管理，以及減少路面擠塞，提升行人的過路安全。局方和署方（運輸署）未來會大力積極推動利用科技在道路和行人路過路設施上，包括交通燈實時管控，亦會有一些比較創新的設計，這是我們未來的方向。

不少議員發言關注泊車位供應。正如我在開場發言提及，接下來我想聚焦講述未來的策略，以積極回應多位議員剛才提及包括商用車方面的關注。政府過去幾年積極推展一系列短期及中長期措施，採取多管齊下的策略，全方位、默默耕耘增加泊車位，當中包括政策創新、多利用科技、推動不同部門加強合作，努力盡快優先滿足商用車輛的泊車需求。跟大家分享一下整體的數字，透過不同措施提供的泊車位總數達30 000個，商用車位佔了三分之一，而過去三年新增的泊車位則超過15 000個。泊車位與領牌車輛數目的比例，以私家車為例，由二○二一年的1.09逐漸回升至現時的1.14，增長達4.6%，可見增加泊車位措施已漸見成效。

展望未來，政府預計未來兩年內新增泊車位數量將超過12 000個，包括至少700個商用車泊位。另外我們會努力在新短期租約停車場及私人項目提供更多泊位，並聚焦於增加商用車泊位，特別是剛才盧偉國議員和陳紹雄議員均提到的分區情況──較為短缺及違例泊車比較常見的地區如觀塘、葵青、黃大仙、油尖旺及深水埗。就分區做一些指標未必切實可行，我們認為必須要由源頭做起，尤其是一些商用車泊位。很多司機在一日營運之後，可能會回到所居住的地方，譬如一些公共屋邨，所以我們的策略要更加聚焦他們的居住地或者在鄰近地方尋求一些泊車位。惟土地空間真的有限，我們希望盡量靈活使用一些土地。我今日向大家強調，具體和具針對性的措施總共有八項：（i）未來在規劃新發展區時，在道路設計上配置夜間路旁商用車泊車位，供商用車夜間停泊；（ii）積極安排於現有公營房屋開放更多上落客貨處，供商用車夜間停泊，以配合普遍居於公營房屋的商用車司機需要；（iii）安排非住宅用地的附屬泊車位和上落客貨處予商用車於夜間停泊；（iv）現時全港已設有約1 800個夜間路旁泊車位，未來運輸署會加大力度，搜尋更多合適的夜間路旁泊車位，尤其是公共屋邨鄰近位置；（v）鑑於過去幾年商用車位流失主因是許多短期租約停車場被收回，未來我們在決定這些土地的用途時，會加重照顧商用車泊位需求的考量，例如我們近期再與各政府部門加強商討，爭取短期內可在短期租約停車場再增加200個商用車車位，運輸署會繼續爭取設置更多的短期租約停車場；（vi）按二○二一年修訂的《香港規劃標準與準則》的首批資助房屋將於明年陸續落成，我們預計在按照此《準則》而落成及設計的資助房屋中，提供4 800個停車位，當中包括超過200個商用車位；（vii）進一步鼓勵私人停車場採用自動泊車系統。我們計劃在二○二六年或之前，提供不少於3 000個自動化泊車位，現時有五個自動化公眾停車場的工務工程項目正處於興建階段，包括位於將軍澳、新蒲崗及深水埗，而這些系統將會提供多種不同類型的自動泊車系統，包括拼圖型、立體型和圓筒型；再加上六個分布在荃灣、大埔、深水埗、馬鞍山、油麻地的短期租約停車場；我們會爭取在今年年底至二○二九年期間落成有關項目；（viii）正如剛才多位議員提到，除了硬件，在軟件方面，我們會透過加強應用科技和數據以增加泊車位的資訊發放，大幅利用科技提升駕駛者的泊車效率和體驗，引入自動泊車系統以善用空間增加車位密度，亦希望透過應用程式提供實時空置泊車位資訊，以便利駕駛者尋找泊車位，現時已覆蓋超過700個停車場的12萬個泊位和分布全港十八區的全部兩萬多個路旁咪錶位，並透過修例容許駕駛者使用遙控泊車功能，方便他們在狹窄車位泊車。透過上述的八項措施，我很有信心並承諾會令未來香港的泊車位供應持續大為改善，至於商用車位方面，我們定下一個務實目標──未來新增商用車泊位的速率會比過往更加快。

執法方面，警務處進行交通執法時，主要考慮是確保道路安全，減少意外及傷亡，以及維持道路暢通。警務處早前已向立法會交通事務委員會報告前線人員會在不影響道路安全的前提下，視乎現場實際環境靈活判斷，或會就個別情況作酌情處理。根據警方提供的資料，警務人員除了會按照既定的執法指引，亦會視乎每宗個案的相關情況作出考慮，包括評估涉事的車輛是否會造成交通阻塞或構成危險；違例的情況會否屬於一些重點交通執法項目之中，特別是和交通擠塞相關的情況；駕駛者有沒有具備一個合理的原因，以及他們會在合乎指引的情況下適當行使酌情權，例如發出警告以代替用檢控方式處理、違例泊車如果並未造成很嚴重的阻塞，而司機亦都願意立即駛走，在這些情況下警方都有一個詳盡的指引執法。

主席，是次建議的罰款額的調整，相較過去三十多年的通脹率，加幅相對溫和。在考慮的時候，我們希望做到情理兼備，既有助加強阻嚇作用，亦保障交通安全和交通暢順，同時已充分考慮運輸業界的經營情況。收費調整永遠沒有一個好的時機，但是多年不調整的話，會令阻嚇力有所減低。我們希望透過這次修例，再配以我剛才所述的不同的措施，持續去加強道路的安全和提升交通管理上的效率。

主席，我懇請各位議員支持並通過這兩項決議案。多謝主席。"

立法會：商務及經濟發展局副局長就「積極拓展香港新經濟增長點」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 18:52,2025-07-30 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000710.htm,"以下是商務及經濟發展局副局長陳百里博士今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上，就「積極拓展香港新經濟增長點」議員議案的開場發言：

代主席：

我感謝容海恩議員提出這項動議，亦感謝田北辰議員、陳曼琪議員和李浩然議員提出的修正案。

中共中央總書記、國家主席習近平於二○二五年三月五日全國兩會期間發表重要講話，提出要「守牢實體經濟這個根基，堅持推動傳統產業改造升級和開辟戰略性新興產業」。特區政府一直積極配合國家的戰略方向，把握香港在「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的優勢，在鞏固傳統優勢產業的同時，積極開拓新經濟增長點，提升香港的競爭力及國際影響力，充分扮演「超級聯繫人」與「超級增值人」的角色。今日討論的議案與政府的政策方向不謀而合，在此方向下具體工作該如何部署？

首先，我們要做好深化國際交往合作這方面的工作。香港會繼續發揮內聯外通的獨特優勢，連接內地及全球市場，同時進一步拓展「全球南方」新興市場。除了恆常的資助計劃和支援措施，政府一直努力招商引資，並為港商創造有利條件積極開拓新興市場。有關工作主要分為三方面：

第一，加強區域合作。政府正馬不停蹄地與東南亞國家聯盟、中東及「一帶一路」沿線地區展開經貿合作，包括香港於去年三月與巴林簽訂促進和保護投資協定（投資協定），而香港與卡塔爾已大致完成投資協定談判，並正與沙特阿拉伯、孟加拉國、埃及和秘魯探討簽訂投資協定。同時，我們會繼續積極聯繫《區域全面經濟伙伴關係協定》（RCEP）成員，透過不同平台及場合進行游說，爭取盡快加入RCEP，讓香港貢獻力量，促進區域經濟融合發展。

第二，建構高增值供應鏈。因應部分供應鏈正向「全球南方」及「一帶一路」沿線國家遷移，以及內地企業積極「走出去」的趨勢，投資推廣署和香港貿易發展局（貿發局）在去年十二月已建立高增值供應鏈服務機制，聯手吸引內地企業到香港建立管理離岸貿易和供應鏈的國際或區域總部，並為在港企業提供一站式專業諮詢服務，以協助它們「走出去」重新部署其環球供應鏈。該機制有助香港深化國際交往合作，同時有助開拓新經濟增長點。

第三，推進「一帶一路」建設。香港會繼續發揮作為「一帶一路」功能平台的角色。行政長官於今年五月率領50多位香港商貿代表和內地企業代表前往卡塔爾和科威特訪問，與中東地區進一步建立政府之間的關係、開拓合作領域擴大「朋友圈」。是次出訪成果相當理想，並達成了共59項合作備忘錄和協議合作，奠定多元基礎。

除了繼續努力深化與內地及國際市場的聯繫，政府亦會加強推動不同產業、不同領域的持續發展，包括創新科技、太空經濟、低空經濟、專業認證、清真產業、金融創新、綠色產業、文創產業及體育產業等方面。

在創新科技方面，政府以產業為導向，透過一系列措施推動香港創科發展及企業升級轉型，加快建設具有香港優勢的新實體經濟，並聚焦發展生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人，以及先進製造與新能源科技等具策略性意義的創科產業。

在太空經濟方面，國務院總理李強今年在《政府工作報告》提出了因地制宜發展新質生產力，開展新技術新產品新場景大規模應用示範行動，推進包括商業航天等的新產業。為配合國家發展新機遇，政府一直透過「創新及科技基金」支持各科技範疇的研究及發展，包括支援香港的大學和研發中心進行與航天相關的電子、數據處理和材料科學等範疇的研發。此外，政府已在InnoHK創新香港研發平台下成立香港太空機械人與能源中心。另外，為了讓業界更好把握低軌衞星作為全球衞星發展的新趨勢及當中的發展機遇，政府正進行簡化申請營辦低軌衞星牌照審批的研究工作，目標是在二○二五年內完成相關工作。

在低空經濟方面，財政司副司長領導的發展低空經濟工作組正以多管齊下的策略，全力構建智慧低空經濟生態圈。在應用層面上，我們透過推行「監管沙盒」試點項目，推動無人機技術在不同領域的突破性應用。法規方面，立法會剛於七月中通過有關擴大無人機規管範圍及開放載人飛行器試驗的法例修訂工作。工作組會繼續推進低空經濟基礎建設規劃及區域融合發展。

在清真產業方面，政府透過多方面提升香港在清真市場的競爭力。在吸引資金方面，政府已修訂法例，為發行伊斯蘭債券提供一個與傳統債券相若的稅務架構，並容許在政府債券計劃下發行伊斯蘭債券。至於貿易方面，貿發局一直就重點清真市場進行研究，為港商提供實用資訊。貿發局亦一直提供不同平台推動清真市場的商機，例如每年都在其美食商貿博覽推廣不同優質清真產品和食品，以及相關產品貿易，協助餐飲業拓展網絡和業務。另外，為推動旅遊業界提升穆斯林旅遊配套，香港旅遊發展局已積極與不同機構合作，透過提升穆斯林友善的旅遊設施；為酒店、景點和會議展覽場地進行相關評級；推動餐廳參與清真認證等，從而吸引更多穆斯林旅客訪港。

在專業認證服務方面，現時本地業界提供的專業認證服務已由電子電氣產品、建築材料等傳統產業拓展到環境、社會及管治、綠色金融等新興領域。政府一直和香港檢測和認證局緊密合作，透過多元化的線上線下宣傳和研討會等活動，協助業界針對性地推廣認證服務，發掘新商機。

在金融創新方面，為促進數字資產行業的可持續發展，繼政府在二○二三年六月實施數字資產交易平台發牌制度，《穩定幣條例》亦會於八月一日正式實施，為穩定幣發行人發牌訂下法定監管制度。政府亦正就其他數字資產活動規管範疇進行公眾諮詢，務求完善有關規管，助力市場健康發展。

在綠色產業方面，政府一直透過低碳綠色科研基金和「創新及科技基金」支援本地綠色科技發展，將具實際應用潛力的科研項目轉化為具商業價值的技術或產品，並在本地生產，長遠促進香港綠色產業發展。另外，香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融中心，正積極推動金融科技和綠色金融更好結合。其中，政府在「政府可持續債券計劃」下已成功發行合共約2,400億元等值的政府綠色債券，當中包括兩批代幣化綠色債券，分別是全球首批政府代幣化綠色債券及全球首批多貨幣計價數碼原生綠色債券，充分展示香港在結合債券市場、綠色和可持續金融，以及金融創新方面的優勢和領導地位。

在文化創意產業方面，政府正致力落實於去年十一月公布的《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，為經濟發展提供動力。其中一個發展方向是完善文藝創意產業生態圈，透過建立和拓展產業平台，促進跨界別和跨領域的合作。其中，政府以產業導向原則，培育具產業化潛質的文創項目，例如在剛完結的香港動漫電玩節中設立「香港國際潮玩博覽」、資助漫畫業界年度盛事「國際漫畫家大會」及「國際漫畫展」等，展現香港作為亞洲創意之都的地位，全方位支援產業化發展。

在體育產業方面，近年香港體育產業的規模正穩步擴展。根據二○二四年八月公布的資料，體育及相關活動在二○二二年以基本價格計算的增加價值約為380億元，較五年前增加11.8%。政府除了加強對精英運動員的支援和透過「M」品牌計劃吸引國際體育盛事在香港舉行，啟德體育園的落成為推動體育和周邊產業注入新動力，在推動本港體育全面發展的同時，帶動娛樂、演出及旅遊業等相關產業的發展，對促進體育產業化和推動經濟發揮積極作用。

結語

代主席，今日的議案涵蓋多個政策範疇，政府相關政策局和部門會通力合作，為有利經濟發展的範疇致力提供合適的政策和環境，我們亦非常歡迎議員的寶貴建議。接下來，我會細心聆聽各位議員的意見，稍後在總結發言時再詳細回應。代主席，我謹此陳辭。"
立法會：署理勞工及福利局局長就「完善灣區人才標準，促進區域人才流動」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 18:18,2025-07-30 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000683.htm,"以下是署理勞工及福利局（勞福局）局長何啟明今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議就「完善灣區人才標準，促進區域人才流動」議員議案的總結發言全文：

代主席：

我再次感謝顏汶羽議員提出這項議案，以及梁子穎議員提出的修正案。同時，我感謝在座議員就這項議題表逹的意見及提出的建議，我會在此簡略回應。

正如我在開場發言所說，特區政府一直採取多管齊下的策略，以培育本地人才為主，引入外來人才為輔，豐富香港的人才庫，增強香港發展動能，主動對接國家「十四五」規劃及粵港澳大灣區建設，加快融入國家發展大局。

大灣區內城市有不同的優勢和定位，在人才培養、招攬、交流等方面有廣闊的合作空間。為了共同建設粵港澳大灣區人才高地，很多政策局及部門一直就相關行業致力推動香港與其他大灣區城市的專業人才發展、便捷兩地專業人才資格互認及強化相關標準銜接的工作，包括律政司、發展局、教育局、環境及生態局、醫務衞生局、房屋局、財經事務及庫務局以及勞福局。各政策局及部門都非常重視和關心灣區內人才流動的情況，會與相關行業的業界人士及團體緊密聯繫，了解行業最新發展及人力需求情況，並與其他大灣區城市負責單位商議，從而制定及優化相關措施。

在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》（CEPA）的框架下，內地已在絕大部分的服務貿易領域對香港實施優惠和便利措施，包括放寬香港專業人士提供服務的資質要求、准許香港專業人士在內地參加考試、註冊、執業和開業，以及鼓勵雙方的專業機構進行資格互認。目前，多個服務領域已設立專業資格互認或專業資格考試的考卷豁免安排，包括建築及相關工程、證券及期貨、銀行和房地產。

在建築及相關工程服務方面，正如剛才盧偉國議員提到，發展局與內地相關部門合作，允許合資格的香港工程、建築、測量、規劃和園境五個專業範疇的企業和專業人士，無須通過資格互認，只要完成簡單的備案程序，對應內地相應的資格，便可以到大灣區內地九市直接提供服務。另一方面，發展局與廣東省及澳門合作，就建造技術工人及技術人員的技術水平建立灣區標準，並推展「一試多證」安排。未來，我們會持續優化所需配套措施，支持粵港澳三地在建造業人才培育方面的合作，助力整個大灣區的建造業邁向更高質量發展。

在金融服務領域，政府一直致力建立金融人才庫，為業界創造發展動能。在CEPA框架下，內地與香港已就不同金融服務業的專業及行業資格推出開放措施，有利於內地金融人才來港發展。除了我較早前提到有關證券、基金及期貨行業，以及銀行業的資格互認機制，在會計專業方面，香港會計師公會與中國註冊會計師協會亦設有會計專業考試科目豁免安排。

地產代理服務方面，兩地的規管機構可分別推薦合資格地產代理及房地產經紀人參加由對方專門開設的培訓課程及考試。在完成課程及通過考試後，相關人士可申請在對方管轄範圍從事相關行業的資格。

在環境保護方面，香港在環境法規、國際認證及專業管理方面具有優勢。環境保護署（環保署）一直與相關專業學會合作，為環保相關科目的畢業生及年青環境專業人士提供實習培訓。剛才盧偉國議員提到，亦感謝你的推進，環保署計劃聯同香港合資格環保專業人員學會，與內地探索建立環保專業人員認證的可行性，以促進香港與大灣區內地城市的交流和合作。

而在爭議解決服務方面，粵港澳三地法律部門亦將爭取在今年內推出大灣區仲裁員名冊，以推動粵港澳大灣區仲裁員的人才連接，構建大灣區內多元化爭議解決機制。

代主席，雖然剛剛提到我們進行了許多工作，但當然很多工作仍有待推進，包括陳祖恒議員提到實習簽證的問題、周文港議員提到的學歷互認問題、黃俊碩議員提到「開小門而關小門」的問題，以及謝偉銓議員提到單一窗口的問題均仍待解決。然而，有些議員提出的問題我們已處理，包括剛才洪雯議員提到是否可透過香港引進國際領軍人才，其實今早在立法會前廳交流會上，政務司司長亦提到我們已釐定領軍人才引進機制，若各位議員物色到世界上頂尖的行業領軍人才，歡迎告訴我們，我們會主動出擊，以期將他們引來香港。

另外，黃錦輝議員提到能否讓職專學校的學生畢業後直接來港服務，其實在現行的職專畢業生留港計劃下已有類似操作安排，我們希望有更多非本地技術專才可以來到香港就讀職業訓練局，然後在港就業及紮根。我們會繼續與內地相關機構發展並完善類似安排。

政府各政策局及部門會繼續因應各行業最新發展及人力需求情況，制定及優化相應的培訓策略和措施，提升相關行業人才的職業和專業技能。此外，職業訓練局及僱員再培訓局亦提供全面的職業專才教育及培訓服務，提升本地勞動力的整體競爭力。

優質的人才是發展的重要動能，也是世界各地爭相競逐的對象。大灣區內城市各有不同優勢和定位，香港會繼續與其他大灣區城市攜手引才、留才、育才、用才，對接國家「十四五」規劃及粵港澳大灣區建設，加快融入國家發展大局。特區政府感謝各位議員對這項議題的重視和關心，各政策局和部門會繼續與業界人士及團體保持緊密溝通，並與其他大灣區城市負責單位聯繫和商議，推動香港與其他大灣區城市的專業人才發展、便捷兩地專業人才資格互認及強化相關標準銜接的工作，促進區域人才流動。

多謝主席。"
立法會二十題：發展九龍城區海濱,2025-07-30 18:15,2025-07-30 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000624.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上李慧琼議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為隨着《2024年保護海港（修訂）條例草案》於本年五月獲本會通過，以及當局已邀請香港鐵路有限公司研究將紅磡站南面的臨海及前碼頭用地打造成設有遊艇會的海濱新地標，九龍城區海濱可望透過連接黃埔、土瓜灣和啟德等地區而得以貫通，而海濱區更可延伸至尖沙咀和觀塘海濱長廊，是政府建立「全民海濱」的重要契機。同時，由於啟德體育園落成及啟德跑道區持續發展，海濱區將吸引大量市民及遊客，周邊區域的交通配套及接駁設施的需求將大幅增加。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有何具體方案和時間表處理現時九龍城區海濱的斷點問題，包括翔龍灣煤氣調壓站、海心公園魚尾石一帶及青洲英泥碼頭私人地段；

（二）如何評估現時啟德區（尤其是跑道區）交通配套的不足之處；有何計劃改善該區的交通連接，包括水上交通和陸路接駁，以提升區域暢達性及應對大型盛事舉辦時的人流需求；

（三）如何解決舊區與海濱之間連接不足的問題；會否與市區重建局協調，在重建項目中加強行人系統網絡，以提升舊區與海濱的連接性；

（四）當局有何初步構思善用九龍城海濱水域資源；會否考慮發展水上活動設施，以配合啟德體育園及「青年驛站」旅舍的建設；及

（五）如何評估九龍城區的歷史文化資源與海濱發展的協同效應；有何計劃將該區內的歷史文化元素融入海濱發展？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直與海濱事務委員會緊密合作，推動各項優化維港海濱的工作，為公眾營造多元、活力、暢達和共融的海濱空間。就李議員關注的尖沙咀至啟德海濱發展而言，在長約15公里的可發展海濱長廊當中，目前已駁通將近七成，二○二八年年底將駁通近八成半。此外，我們會持續提升區內的海濱設施，例如於七月中開放紅磡都市公園（第二期），最近亦建議在發展紅磡站周邊和海濱一帶用地時，在紅磡繞道底臨海一段進行小規模填海工程，善用修訂的《保護海港條例》（第531章）的拆牆鬆綁機制興建新行人板道以連接尖沙咀海濱長廊與紅磡海濱長廊，以及優化海濱與內陸的行人連接，加強區域暢達性。

就提問各部分，經諮詢運輸及物流局、文化體育及旅遊局、民政及青年事務局和九龍城民政事務處後，現回覆如下：

（一）就李議員提及的三個地點，發展局目前有以下構思：

（i）海心公園內魚尾石一帶的海濱：魚尾石臨海一段是維港兩岸僅存的自然海岸線之一，我們認為應予以保留，現階段沒有計劃進行填海工程。現時魚尾石後方已設有行人通道連接海心公園擴建部分的海濱長廊，我們會繼續與康樂及文化事務署探討優化現有行人通道的方案及可行性，進一步改善魚尾石一帶海濱的通達性。

（ii）土瓜灣翔龍灣對開臨海煤氣設施用地：現時該臨海位置的煤氣調壓站及用作運送煤氣原材料石腦油的碼頭仍在運作中。我們與業權人一直保持溝通，探討在不影響上述設施的情況下開通一條行人通道的可能性。土木工程拓展署正就不同行人連接方案，進行定量風險評估，目標在今年內完成。

（iii）紅磡青洲英泥碼頭一帶海濱地段：所涉部分地段的業權已分散賣出，而且部分地段按地契享有進出航道的權利，因此要打通臨海地段存在較多複雜性，較另外兩個地點需要較長時間處理。政府會先探討以非填海的方案貫通該處一帶海濱，包括如業權人有意將用地作與海濱發展相符的用途，政府樂意共同探討可行方案，以期達致共贏的局面。然而，若最終證明這些非填海方案並不可行，我們會研究在該處興建涉及小規模填海工程的行人板道的可能性。

我們會繼續採用「先易後難」的處理方式，改善以上三個海濱地點的暢達性，並把它們納入我們將在短期內展開的「東九龍海濱長廊研究」，以研究進一步貫通相關海濱段落。

（二）運輸及物流局一直因應九龍城區海濱的整體規劃及項目落成進度，持續協調各公共交通營辦商提供服務。啟德發展區一帶現時已接駁至港鐵網絡，加上附近的主幹道和連接路（包括太子道東、承啟道、承豐道等）目前有超過50條巴士及專線小巴路線，方便區內居民往返港九新界各區。運輸署亦已計劃新增兩條專營巴士路線，由啟德郵輪碼頭開出，途經啟德跑道區，分別提供直達紅磡與尖沙咀的特快服務及前往宋皇臺站及啟德站的接駁服務。此外，運輸及物流局正全力推展啟德智慧綠色集體運輸系統，以連接啟德跑道區至啟德站。該局預計今年下半年為項目招標，以期在二○二六年批出合約。水路交通方面，現時「北角—觀塘—啟德」渡輪航線，於周末及公眾假期的航班會停靠啟德跑道區。

就應對於啟德體育園舉辦大型活動的人流需求上，運輸署會與啟德體育園、活動主辦單位及公共交通營運商等保持密切聯繫，在交通管理方面及早作出準備和部署。視乎活動的規模及觀眾的需要，政府及公共交通營運商會加強鐵路服務、開辦特別巴士服務（包括本地和跨境服務），以及協調加強的士服務。

（三）一直以來，發展局會與市區重建局（市建局）溝通和協調，為重建項目加強行人系統網絡，方便市民的日常生活，為社區帶來裨益。就土瓜灣方面，市建局於今年三月委聘顧問展開「土瓜灣海濱研究」，其中一個研究目的正是加強內陸與海濱空間連接，探討藉着市區更新項目改善舊區環境和道路網絡，加強土瓜灣舊區與海濱的連接性和暢達性。市建局預計顧問團隊將於下半年提交初期研究報告及可行性研究建議。我們會就如何加強內陸與海濱之間連接，與市建局協調合作。

（四）為了善用九龍城區及其附近地區的海濱資源，政府進行了不同工作。在發展水上活動設施方面，三個位於觀塘避風塘海濱用地的水上訓練中心已投入運作，近日有不同團體在該處附近水域舉辦各式各樣的本地及國際水上運動／康樂活動／訓練課程，善用該處水體，增添九龍東海旁的活力及吸引力。

在善用水體方面，發展局轄下的起動九龍東辦事處與海事處已共同制定《共享觀塘避風塘指引》，推廣船隻及水上康樂活動於非颱風日子安全共用避風塘。此外，海事處已於二○一八年將觀塘避風塘沿觀塘海濱花園的通航區由50米擴闊一倍至約100米，以䆁放更多空間作水上康樂活動。政府亦會繼續與相關持份者如體育總會及啟德「青年驛站」的營運團體保持緊密聯繫，以善用毗鄰的維港海濱和水體資源。

（五）由政務司副司長任組長的發展旅遊熱點工作組在今年五月公布九個旅遊熱點項目，當中包括「特色社區之香港龍城深度遊」。「深度遊」項目以《九龍城寨光影之旅》電影場景展為出發點，透過包裝並推介不同具特色的旅遊路線，延伸旅客在九龍城區內的體驗。九龍城區是多元文化與新舊共融的特色社區，九龍城民政事務處將善用區內的歷史文化資源，設計別具香港特色的深度旅遊體驗。旅遊路線將涵蓋不同的歷史文化主題，例如寨城歷史、泰潮文化、歷史古蹟以及啟德機場回憶等，吸引旅客和市民沿着主題路線探索不同景點，包括牛棚藝術村和海心公園等毗鄰海濱的歷史文化景點。隨着九龍城臨海用地陸續重建發展，包括香港房屋協會的資助房屋項目，以及毗鄰的市區重建項目，將提供更多優質公共空間予市民享用，我們會邀請有關發展單位積極考慮把九龍城區內歷史文化元素融入海濱的空間。"
LCQ20: Development of harbourfront of Kowloon City District,2025-07-30 18:15,2025-07-30 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000633.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Starry Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

There are views that as the Protection of the Harbour (Amendment) Bill 2024 was passed by this Council in May this year, and the authorities have invited the Mass Transit Railway Corporation Limited to conduct a study to develop the waterfront and former pier sites to the south of Hung Hom Station into a new harbourfront landmark with yacht club, it is hoped that the harbourfront of Kowloon City District can realise connectivity through linking up areas such as Whampoa, To Kwa Wan and Kai Tak, and that the harbourfront zone can even be extended to the harbourfront of Tsim Sha Tsui and Kwun Tong. This serves as an important opportunity for the Government to develop a ""Harbourfront for the People"". At the same time, given the completion of the Kai Tak Sports Park and the continuous development of the runway area of Kai Tak, the harbourfront zone will attract a large number of members of the public and tourists, and the demand for ancillary transport facilities and connection facilities in the surrounding areas will increase substantially. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the specific proposal and timetable for addressing the existing disconnection problem in the harbourfront of Kowloon City District, including the gas offtake station off Grand Waterfront, the vicinity of the Fishtail Rock in Hoi Sham Park, and the private section of the Green Island Cement Pier;

(2) how it evaluates the inadequacies of the existing ancillary transport facilities in Kai Tak area (especially the runway area); of the plans in place to improve transport connectivity in the area, including waterborne transport and land transport, so as to enhance the accessibility of the area and cope with the demand arising from pedestrian flow when mega events are taking place;

(3) how it will address inadequate connectivity between old districts and the harbourfront; whether it will coordinate with the Urban Renewal Authority to enhance the network of pedestrian systems in redevelopment projects, so as to enhance connectivity between old districts and the harbourfront;

(4) of the authorities' preliminary ideas on optimising the use of water resources at the harbourfront of Kowloon City; whether the development of water sports facilities will be considered for supporting the construction of the Kai Tak Sports Park and ""Youth Post"" hostel; and

(5) how it evaluates the synergy between the historical and cultural resources and harbourfront development in Kowloon City District; of the plans in place to incorporate the historical and cultural elements of the district into harbourfront development?

Reply:

President,

The Government has been working closely with the Harbourfront Commission to promote various initiatives to enhance the Victoria Harbourfront, with a view to creating a diversified, vibrant, accessible and inclusive harbourfront space for the public. Regarding the harbourfront development from Tsim Sha Tsui to Kai Tak that Dr the Hon Lee is concerned with, out of the developable promenade of approximately 15 kilometres, nearly 70 per cent has been connected so far, and around 85 per cent is expected to be connected by the end of 2028. In addition, we will continue to improve harbourfront facilities in the district, such as the opening of the Hung Hom Urban Park (Phase 2) in mid-July, as well as recent proposal to make good use of the streamlined mechanism under the amended Protection of the Harbour Ordinance (Cap. 531) to carry out small scale reclamation underneath the waterfront section of the Hung Hom Bypass when developing the sites around Hung Hom Station and waterfront areas, with a view to connecting the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront promenade with the Hung Hom waterfront promenade through construction of a new boardwalk, and also strengthening the pedestrian connectivity between the harbourfront and the inland areas for enhancing the accessibility across regions.

In consultation with the Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB), the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau and the Kowloon City District Office (KCDO), the reply to various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) Regarding the three locations mentioned by Dr the Hon Lee, the latest views of the Development Bureau (DEVB) are as follows:

(i) for the waterfront in the vicinity of the Fishtail Rock in Hoi Sham Park: We consider that being one of the only remaining natural shorelines along the Victoria Harbour, the waterfront section of Fishtail Rock should be retained and there are no plans for reclamation at this stage. Currently, there is a pedestrian connection behind the Fishtail Rock connecting to the promenade of the Hoi Sham Park Extension. We will continue to explore the options and feasibility for enhancing the existing pedestrian connection with the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, with a view to further improving the accessibility of the waterfront in the vicinity of the Fishtail Rock.

(ii) for the waterfront gas facility site off Grand Waterfront in To Kwa Wan: Currently, the gas offtake station and the jetty for transfer of naphtha, the raw material for production of gas, are still in operation. We have been liaising with the landowner to explore the possibility of providing a pathway at its lot under the condition that the operation of the above facilities would not be affected. The Civil Engineering and Development Department is conducting a quantitative risk assessment on various pedestrian connection options, with a target of completion within this year.

(iii) for the waterfront area near the Green Island Cement Pier in Hung Hom: Connecting the concerned waterfront area is more complex and requires more time to tackle than the other two locations due to the fact that the lots therein are under multiple ownership with various owners, and certain parts of these lots have access to the sea according to the relevant leases. The Government would at the moment explore non-reclamation options to connect the harbourfront area, including the case where the concerned owners intend to use the site for a purpose consistent with the harbourfront development, the Government is willing to explore feasible solutions collaboratively with a view to achieving a win-win situation. However, should the non-reclamation options be proven not feasible in the end, we will study the possibility of a boardwalk with small scale reclamation.

We will continue to adopt the approach of ""tackling the simple issues first before the difficult ones"" to improve accessibility of the three waterfront locations above, and will incorporate them into the Study on East Kowloon Harbourfront Trail to be commenced in the near future, to examine further connecting the relevant harbourfront sections.

(2) The TLB has been co-ordinating with various public transport operators to provide services in line with the overall planning and progress of the completion of the various projects along the Kowloon City harbourftont. The Kai Tak Development Area (KTDA) is now connected to the MTR network, and together with the main roads and connecting roads in its vicinity (including Prince Edward Road East, Shing Kai Road, Shing Fung Road, etc.) are currently served by over 50 franchised bus and green minibus (GMB) routes, making it convenient for residents to travel to and from different districts on the Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories. The Transport Department (TD) has also planned to introduce two new franchised bus routes, which will provide express service from the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal via the Kai Tak Runway Area (KTRA) to Hung Hom/Tsim Sha Tsui direct and connecting service to Sung Wong Toi Station and Kai Tak Station respectively. In addition, the TLB is implementing the Smart and Green Mass Transit System in Kai Tak (the Project) in full swing for connecting the KTRA to the Kai Tak Station. It is targeted to invite tender for the Project in the second half of 2025 for awarding the contract in 2026. In terms of water transport, currently the ""North Point–Kwun Tong–Kai Tak"" ferry route calls at the KTRA on weekends and public holidays.

To cope with the demand arising from pedestrian flow when mega events are taking place in the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP), the TD will maintain close communication with the KTSP, event organisers and public transport operators to make advance preparations and arrangements in terms of transportation management. Depending on the scale of events and the needs of the spectators, the Government and public transport operators will strengthen rail services, introduce special bus services (including local and cross-boundary services) and co-ordinate enhanced taxi services.

(3) The DEVB and the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) have all along been maintaining close communication and co-ordination to strengthen the pedestrian network in redevelopment projects, facilitating citizens' daily lives and benefiting the community. Regarding To Kwa Wan, the URA commissioned consultants in March this year to launch the To Kwa Wan Harbourfront Study. One of the study's objectives is to strengthen the connection between the inland area and the harbourfront, explore measures to improve the environment of old district and the road network through urban renewal projects, thereby enhancing the connectivity and accessibility between the To Kwa Wan old district and the harbourfront. The URA expected the consultant team to submit a preliminary study report and feasibility study proposals in the second half of this year. We will co-ordinate and join forces with the URA on exploring ways to enhance connectivity between inland areas and the waterfront.

(4) The Government has undertaken various initiatives to leverage harbourfront resources in the Kowloon City District and its adjacent areas. Regarding the development of water sports facilities, three water sports training centres at waterfront sites around the Kwun Tong Typhoon Shelter (KTTS) have come into operation. Recently, different organisations have organised a variety of local and international water sports/recreational activities/training courses at the water bodies near KTTS, effectively utilising the water bodies and enhancing the vibrancy and attractiveness of the Kowloon East waterfront.

In respect of making good use of the water bodies, the Energizing Kowloon East Office under the DEVB and the Marine Department have jointly promulgated the Guidelines for Co-using KTTS to promote water body co-use between vessels and water recreational activities in the KTTS during non-typhoon days. Besides, the Marine Department has widened the passageway in KTTS along Kwun Tong Promenade from 50 m to about 100 m in 2018 to allow more space for water recreational activities. The Government will continue to maintain close communication with relevant stakeholders, such as sports associations and the operator of the ""Youth Post"" in Kai Tak, to optimise the use of the adjacent Victoria Harbourfront and water resources.

(5) The Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, led by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, announced nine tourist hotspot projects in May 2025, among which is ""Featured community - In-depth travel in Kowloon City"". Taking the ""Kowloon Walled City: A Cinematic Journey"" Movie Set Exhibition as the starting point, this project curates and promotes several unique travel routes to enhance tourists' experience in Kowloon City District. Kowloon City District is a distinctive neighbourhood with multicultural background and the blend of old and new elements. The KCDO will leverage the historic and cultural resources in the district to design in-depth travel experiences that showcase the unique character of Hong Kong. These travel routes will feature various historical and cultural themes, such as the history of the Kowloon Walled City, Thai and Chiu Chow cultures, historic sites and the legacy of Kai Tak airport, and will encourage both tourists and the public to explore different attractions along the thematic routes, such as the Cattle Depot Artist Village and Hoi Sham Park, along with other historic and cultural attractions adjacent to the harbourfront. With the progressive redevelopment of waterfront sites in Kowloon City, including the subsidised housing projects of the Hong Kong Housing Society and the urban renewal initiatives nearby, more quality public spaces will be provided for public enjoyment. We will invite the relevant development bodies to actively consider incorporating the historical and cultural elements of the Kowloon City District into the harbourfront spaces."

立法會十四題：協助青年置業的措施,2025-07-30 18:05,2025-07-30 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000554.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上梁毓偉議員的提問和政務司副司長兼任房屋局局長卓永興的書面答覆：

問題：

本屆政府近年積極鼓勵青年在房屋階梯向上流動，並採取多項措施協助青年置業。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）在「白表居屋第二市場計劃2024」（「白居二2024」）的申請者中，「青年計劃（白居二）」的青年申請者的人數及其所佔百分比為何，並按年齡組別（即18歲至29歲及30歲至39歲）列出分項資料；

（二）「白居二2024」的6 000個名額中，最終編配予40歲以下申請者的數目為何；當局會否因應該計劃的反應和青年的置業需求，進一步增加青年計劃（白居二）的名額；

（三）有否統計過去五年，每年按揭保險計劃（按保計劃）下的八成及九成按揭貸款的申請數目，以及該等數目佔每年新批出按揭貸款個案總數的百分比分別為何；八成及九成按揭貸款的申請者中，有多少人屬40歲以下青年；

（四）鑑於去年八月香港按證保險有限公司（按保公司）宣布一項新安排，合資格業主（例如業主家庭將有新生嬰兒而導致住屋要求改變）可獲豁免按保計劃下的業主自住要求並將物業出租，政府是否知悉按保公司會否考慮優化有關措施（例如將受惠資格由新生嬰兒家庭擴展至涵蓋有年幼子女家庭），從而使更多青年家庭可按家庭需要轉換居所；

（五）據悉部分以往利用按保計劃申請高成數按揭置業的青年家庭，因樓價調整而難以換樓，甚至出現負資產，影響其人生規劃，政府有否調研、統計及監察有關情況對青年家庭的影響，並適時作出措施防止問題惡化；及

（六）會否在資助房屋政策方面進一步協助青年置業，例如調整資助房屋供應比例、將青年計劃擴展至香港房屋協會的資助房屋，以及增加每年資助房屋可供申請次數及大單位的供應比例等，從而使資助房屋成為青年首次置業的重要渠道？

答覆:

主席：

本屆政府自上任以來，積極推展多項針對公營房屋供應「提速、提量、提效、提質」的措施。在我們不懈努力下，公營房屋供應已扭轉了「頭輕尾重」的情況。連同30000個「簡約公屋」單位在內，未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），總體公營房屋供應量將達197000伙，較本屆政府上任時的五年期（即二○二二／二三至二○二六／二七年度），大幅增加超過85%，為市民安居樂業提供堅實的基礎。香港房屋委員會（房委會）亦一直致力完善房屋階梯，透過出售資助單位協助中低收入家庭自置居所，鼓勵他們按自己的能力選擇合適的房屋階梯上流。

我們留意到不少青年人均努力工作，透過累積經驗及儲蓄，向上流動。在各類資助出售單位的買家中，40歲以下的青年人一直佔大多數。舉例而言，成功購買一手居者有其屋計劃（居屋）單位的申請者有近一半是40歲以下；約80%的「白表居屋第二市場計劃」（白居二）申請者及買家亦是40歲以下的青年人。事實上，資助出售單位的售價亦屬青年可負擔。以「居屋2024」為例，經以負擔能力基準計算後，單位是以相當於市價的七折發售。按平均售價計算，一個實用面積約380呎單位的售價只是約270萬元。由於房委會為購買資助出售單位的人士提供按揭貸款保證，一般而言白表買家可以取得單位售價九成的按揭貸款。以上述380呎的單位為例，假設利息為3.5%和按揭還款期為30年，青年只需付出約27萬元首期和每月供款10,900元，便可成為業主。

為進一步協助青年人，房委會推出了一系列助力置業的措施。首先，由下一期居屋銷售計劃開始，房委會會為40歲以下的白表青年家庭及一人申請者分派多一個抽籤號碼；而在第二市場方面，房委會亦已由「白居二2024」起，增加1500個配額至6000個，並將新增配額全數撥予40歲以下的青年家庭及一人申請者。

與此同時，香港房屋協會（房協）作為政府在房屋政策方面的緊密合作伙伴，亦全力支持政府在協助青年置業的相關房屋政策措施，包括為申請購買資助出售房屋的40歲以下白表青年家庭及一人申請者分派多一個抽籤號碼。房協將繼續參考房委會的相關安排，並積極配合。

另外，政府亦透過「港人首次置業」（「首置」）項目，協助既不符合申請居屋資格、又未能負擔私營房屋的較高收入人士，達到他們的置業期望。除了市區重建局首兩個已推售的「首置」項目（即「煥然懿居」第一和第二座，以及「煥然懿居」第三座）共售出超過600個「首置」單位，政府正推展另外數個「首置」項目，於未來數年起合共提供約5000個「首置」單位。而過去所推售「首置」單位的申請人以及最終買家，有大約85%是40歲或以下青年。

除了提供不同類型的資助房屋外，政府亦推行了其他措施協助市民置業。本屆政府自二○二四年二月起撤銷所有住宅物業需求管理措施；香港金融管理局亦自二○二四年十月起修訂了物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，將最高物業按揭成數和「供款與入息比率」上限回復至二○○九年開始實施逆周期措施以前的水平——即不論物業價值，按揭成數上限一律調整至70%，供款與入息比率上限一律調整為50%——以便利不同置業需要的人士。個別人士更可按自身需要，透過按揭保險計劃（按保計劃）借取高成數的按揭貸款，其中有固定收入的首次置業人士購置價格1,000萬元或以下的物業，按揭成數可高達90%，大大減輕首期負擔。同時，政府自二○二五年二月二十六日起調整買賣或轉讓住宅及非住宅物業須繳付的從價印花稅的稅階，將徵收100元物業印花稅適用的物業價值上限由300萬元提高至400萬元，全方位協助有意置業的市民及青年。就資助出售單位而言，由於絕大部分單位的定價均低於400萬元（以「居屋2024」為例，單位平均售價為270萬元），買家已能受惠於上述印花稅降至100元的措施，最多可以節省近60,000元。

就梁毓偉議員的提問，經諮詢財經事務及庫務局，我們現回覆如下：

（一）在「白居二2024」申請期內，房委會共收到約34000份申請，超額申請約為五倍，顯示市民對二手資助出售單位的需求持續殷切。所有申請中，超過80%為選擇參加今期新推出「青年計劃（白居二）」的青年申請者，反映計劃相當受青年申請者歡迎。有關於「白居二2024」選擇參加「青年計劃（白居二）」的青年申請者數目及年齡分布，詳見附件一。

（二）「白居二2024」已於2025年4月攪珠，房委會預計會於二○二五年第三／四季向成功申請者發出批准信。批准信持有人可在指定日期內申請「購買資格證明書」（有效期12個月），以便購買未補價的資助出售單位。房委會會持續檢視配額使用情況、資助出售單位的需求，以及整體市場情況等因素，適時調整整體配額數量及「青年計劃（白居二）」名額。

（三）按保計劃由香港按證保險有限公司﹙按證保險公司）經營，以協助市民在香港安居置業。銀行在敍造住宅物業按揭貸款的時候，須遵守按揭成數上限的規定，而現時的按揭成數上限為70%。按保計劃則為銀行提供按揭保險，使銀行可以提供較高成數（即70%以上）的按揭貸款而毋須承擔額外的風險。在按保計劃下，只要申請個案符合相關條件，銀行一般可以提供高達80%的按揭貸款；對於首次置業的固定受薪人士，按揭成數更可達到90%。置業人士的首期負擔因而可以大大減輕。

過去五年，每年按保計劃下新取用按揭貸款宗數（以按揭成數劃分），以及該等數目佔每年新取用按揭貸款個案總數的百分比（即括號內所述數字）載列於附件二。

在上述新取用按揭貸款當中，涉及至少一名40歲以下業主的宗數，以及該等數目佔每年新取用按揭貸款個案宗數（以按揭成數劃分）的百分比（即括號內所述數字）載列於附件三。

（四）按證保險公司於二○二四年八月在按保計劃下設立新安排，按個別情況考慮批准合資格業主將自住的物業出租，以協助他們應付因個人或家庭處境轉變帶來的特別需要（新安排）。新安排推行接近一年，運作暢順，為有特別需要的業主提供實質協助。在新安排下，除了業主家庭將有新生嬰兒／領養兒童或業主失業的情況，業主如有其他特別需要而本身在相關物業已自住最少12個月，亦可透過銀行向按證保險公司申請將自住物業出租。現行機制已容許有年幼子女並滿足自住要求的業主，就其特別需要提出將自住物業出租的申請。按證保險公司會按個別情況考慮批准相關個案。

（五）按保計劃的目的是協助市民置業安居，為他們提供多一個財務安排選擇。物業市場的波動受許多不同因素影響，市民須因應自己置業的需要及還款能力作出考慮，小心評估風險。

（六）如上述所言，房委會及房協不遺餘力地優化各項安排，以協助有置業夢想的年輕人奮力向上，踏上置業階梯。行政長官已在二○二四年《施政報告》公布，房委會會調整公共租住房屋（公屋）（包括綠表置居計劃單位）和資助出售單位的比例，由七比三逐步調整至六比四，增加資助出售單位的供應。在未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），房委會和房協將共有約56500個資助出售單位落成。與此同時，房委會正落實二○二二年《施政報告》中有關新建單位面積「封底」的安排，即所有於二○二六／二七年度起落成的資助出售單位一般實用面積不會少於26平方米。此外，在未來十年期的較後時間，公營房屋的單位會預留10%的面積增長。我們亦正研究其他進一步協助青年購買資助房屋的措施，並會適時推出。然而，我們希望藉此機會再次呼籲年青人，應發揮潛力創造更豐盛的未來；萬勿為了符合申請公屋資格而限制自身的發展空間。過去五年（即二○二○／二一至二○二四／二五年度），獲編配公屋單位的非長者一人申請者平均年齡為57歲。青年人在了解上述政府為青年人提供的機會及支援後，應及早規劃以在房屋階梯攀得更高。"
LCQ14:Measures to assist young people in home ownership,2025-07-30 18:05,2025-07-30 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000565.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Leung and a written reply by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, who is undertaking the duties of the Secretary for Housing, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

 In recent years, the current-term Government has actively encouraged young people to move up the housing ladder and has put in place a number of measures to assist young people in home ownership. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) among the applicants for the White Form Secondary Market Scheme 2024 (WSM 2024), of the number of young applicants under the Youth Scheme (WSM) and their percentage, with a breakdown by age group (i.e. aged 18 to 29 and aged 30 to 39);

(2) out of the 6 000 quota under WSM 2024, of the number of those ultimately allocated to applicants aged under 40; whether the authorities will further increase the quota for the Youth Scheme (WSM) in the light of the response received and the demand of young people for home ownership;

(3) whether it has compiled statistics on the respective numbers of applications for 80 per cent and 90 per cent loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage loans under the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) in each of the past five years, and the respective percentages of such numbers in the total number of new mortgage loans approved each year; among the applicants for 80 per cent and 90 per cent LTV mortgage loans, of the number of young applicants aged under 40;

(4) given that the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) announced in August last year a new arrangement, in which a waiver of the owner occupancy requirement under MIP will be granted to an eligible homeowner (such as a homeowner's family expecting newborn(s), resulting in a change in housing needs) for renting out the property, whether the Government knows if HKMCI will consider enhancing such measure (such as expanding the eligibility criteria from families with newborn(s) to include families with young child or children as well), thereby enabling more young families to change residence based on family needs;

(5) as it is learnt that some young families who previously acquired mortgage loans with a high LTV ratio through MIP find it difficult to replace their properties due to property price adjustments, and some even find themselves in negative equity, thus affecting their life planning, whether the Government has conducted surveys and studies, compiled statistics, and monitored on how such situation has impacted young families, and taken timely measures to prevent the problem from worsening; and

(6) whether it will further assist young people in home ownership under the subsidised housing policies, such as adjusting the proportion of subsidised housing supply, extending the Youth Scheme to subsidised housing provided by the Hong Kong Housing Society, and increasing the annual number of applications that can be made for subsidised housing and the proportion of larger flats available, thereby making subsidised housing an important channel for young people to purchase their first home?

President,

 Since taking office, the current-term Government has actively implemented multiple measures to ""enhance speed, quantity, efficiency and quality"" in public housing supply. With our unremitting efforts, the problem of back-loaded public housing supply has completely turned around. Coupled with 30 000 Light Public Housing units, the total public housing supply in the coming five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30) will reach 197 000 units, which is 85 per cent higher than that of the first five year period since the current-term Government took office (i.e. 2022-23 to 2026-27), providing a solid foundation for citizens to live and work in contentment. The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has also been striving to enhance the housing ladder by assisting low- to middle-income families to purchase their own homes through the sale of subsidised sale flats (SSF), and encouraging them to move up the housing ladder as appropriate according to their own affordability.

 We notice that many young people are working hard to achieve upward mobility through accumulation of experience and savings. Among buyers of various types of SSF, young people under the age of 40 have always been the majority. For instance, nearly half of the successful applicants for first-hand Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats are under the age of 40. Around 80 per cent of applicants and buyers under the White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) are also young people under the age of 40. In fact, the selling prices of SSF are affordable for young people. Taking HOS 2024 as an example, after applying the affordability benchmarks calculation, the flats are sold at around 70 per cent of the market price. Based on the average selling price, a flat of about 380 square feet in saleable area costs only around $2.7 million. As the HA provides a mortgage default guarantee for buyers of SSF, generally, White Form buyers can secure a mortgage loan at 90 per cent of the flat price. Assuming an interest rate at 3.5 per cent and a 30-year mortgage term, young people would only need to make a down payment of about $270,000, with monthly mortgage payments of $10,900, to become homeowners.

 To further assist young people, the HA has introduced a series of measures to facilitate their flat purchase. First, starting from the next HOS sale exercise, the HA will allocate an extra ballot number to young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 with White Form status. As for the secondary market, starting from WSM 2024, the HA has increased the quota to 6 000 by 1 500, all of which will be allocated to young family and one-person applicants under the age of 40.

 Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS), as a close partner of the Government in housing policies, also fully supports the Government's relevant housing initiatives in helping young people realise their home ownership aspirations, including the allocation of an additional ballot number to White Form young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 for the purchase of SSF. The HKHS will continue to make reference to the relevant arrangements of the HA and actively work towards the same.

 In addition, the Government also assists those higher-income persons who are not eligible for HOS and yet cannot afford private housing to achieve their home ownership aspirations through Starter Homes for Hong Kong Residents (SH) projects. Apart from the first two SH projects offered for sale by the Urban Renewal Authority (i.e. eResidence Towers 1 and 2, as well as eResidence Tower 3) with a total of over 600 SH units sold, the Government is also taking forward a few other SH projects, which will provide a total of around 5 000 SH units from the next few years onwards. Amongst applicants and final purchasers of SH units offered for sale in the past, around 85 per cent were youth aged 40 or below.

 Besides providing various types of subsidised housing, the Government has also implemented other measures to assist citizens in home purchase. The current-term Government has since February 2024 abolished all demand-side management measures for residential properties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also since October 2024 adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans. The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit were reverted to the pre-2009 levels before the countercyclical macroprudential measures were first introduced, with the maximum LTV ratio for all residential properties adjusted to 70 per cent, regardless of the value of the property, and the DSR limit adjusted to 50 per cent, providing facilitation to persons with different needs for property purchase. Individuals may also obtain high LTV ratio mortgage loans through the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) according to their own needs. In particular, for first-time homebuyers with regular income purchasing properties priced at $10 million or below, the LTV ratio can be up to 90 per cent, which greatly reduces their down payment burden. Meanwhile, to provide comprehensive support for citizens and young people who have aspirations in purchasing flats, the Government has since February 26, 2025 adjusted the value bands of Ad Valorem Stamp Duty payable for sale and purchase or transfer of residential and non-residential properties, raising the maximum value of properties chargeable to $100 stamp duty from $3 million to $4 million. As for SSF, since most units are priced below $4 million (taking HOS 2024 as an example, the average selling price is around $2.7 million), buyers may thus benefit from the aforementioned reduction in stamp duty to $100, with savings to nearly $60,000.

 In consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, our reply to the questions raised by the Hon Kenneth Leung is as follows:

(1) During the application period of WSM 2024, the HA received a total of around 34 000 applications. The oversubscription rate is about five times, reflecting the persistent strong demand for second hand SSF of citizens. Among all of the applications received, over 80 per cent came from young applicants opting to join the newly implemented Youth Scheme (WSM), showing that the scheme was well received by the young applicants. Regarding the number and age distribution of young applicants who opted for the Youth Scheme (WSM) under WSM 2024, please refer to Annex 1.

(2) Balloting for WSM 2024 was conducted in April 2025. The HA expects that approval letters will be issued to successful applicants in the third/fourth quarter of 2025. Within the specified period, holders of the approval letters may apply for Certificate of Eligibility to Purchase (valid for 12 months) to purchase a SSF with premium unpaid. The HA will continuously monitor factors including the quota utilisation, demand for SSF, overall market conditions, etc, to make timely adjustments to both the total number of quota and the allocations under the Youth Scheme (WSM).

(3) The MIP is administered by the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) for promoting home ownership in Hong Kong. When approving residential mortgage loans, banks have to comply with LTV requirement on owner-occupied residential mortgage lending, which is currently set at 70 per cent. With the MIP providing mortgage insurance to banks, banks can provide mortgage loans with higher LTV ratio (i.e. above 70 per cent) without incurring additional credit risk. As long as an application meets the relevant eligibility criteria, the bank can generally provide a mortgage loan of up to 80 per cent LTV ratio under the MIP. For first-time homebuyers with fixed salaries, the maximum LTV ratio can even reach 90 per cent, substantially reducing the down payment burden for homebuyers.

 The numbers of new loans drawn down under the MIP in the past five years (categorised by LTV ratio), and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 2.

 Among above new loans drawn down, the numbers of cases involving at least one homeowner aged below 40, and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (categorised by LTV ratio) (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 3.

(4) In August 2024, the HKMCI put in place a new arrangement under the MIP to approve on a case-by-case basis eligible homeowners' applications for renting out their self-occupied properties, so as to help them meet their special needs arising from changes in personal or family circumstances (new arrangement). The new arrangement has been implemented for around one year smoothly, offering substantial assistance to homeowners with special needs. Under the new arrangement, in addition to the situation that the homeowner's family is expecting newborn(s)/adopting child or children or the homeowner has become unemployed, any homeowner who has other special needs and has been residing in the relevant property for not less than 12 months may also submit an application to the HKMCI through a bank for renting out the self-occupied property. The existing mechanism already allows homeowners who have young children and are able to meet the self-occupancy requirement to submit applications for renting out their self-occupied properties based on their special needs. The HKMCI will consider approving the relevant applications on a case-by-case basis.

(5) The objective of the MIP is to promote home ownership and provide citizens with an additional option for financing. As the fluctuation of the property market is subject to various factors, citizens should take into consideration their needs for home ownership and repayment capability, and assess the risks carefully.

(6) As mentioned above, both the HA and the HKHS are making relentless efforts to optimise various arrangements to help young people with home ownership aspirations strive to climb onto the home ownership ladder. The Chief Executive announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the HA would adjust the ratio between public rental housing (PRH) (including Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme flats) and SSF from 7:3 to 6:4 in order to increase the supply of SSF. In the next five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30), the HA and the HKHS will complete about 56 500 SSF. Meanwhile, the HA is implementing the arrangement announced in the 2022 Policy Address regarding the minimum floor area for new flats. The saleable area of all SSF completed from 2026-27 onwards will be no less than 26 square metres in general. Furthermore, in the latter part of the coming decade, we will reserve 10 per cent increase in floor area for public housing. We are also exploring other measures to further assist young people in purchasing SSF and the measures will be launched in a timely manner. That said, we would like to take this opportunity to appeal to young people once again to unleash their potential and create a more prosperous future, but not to limit their room for development just for the sake of meeting the eligibility criteria for PRH application. In the past five years (i.e. 2020-21 to 2024-25), the average age of non-elderly one-person applicants that were housed to PRH was 57 years old. After understanding the above opportunities and support provided by the Government for young people, young people should plan ahead of time so as to climb higher up the housing ladder."

Question:

 In recent years, the current-term Government has actively encouraged young people to move up the housing ladder and has put in place a number of measures to assist young people in home ownership. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) among the applicants for the White Form Secondary Market Scheme 2024 (WSM 2024), of the number of young applicants under the Youth Scheme (WSM) and their percentage, with a breakdown by age group (i.e. aged 18 to 29 and aged 30 to 39);

(2) out of the 6 000 quota under WSM 2024, of the number of those ultimately allocated to applicants aged under 40; whether the authorities will further increase the quota for the Youth Scheme (WSM) in the light of the response received and the demand of young people for home ownership;

(3) whether it has compiled statistics on the respective numbers of applications for 80 per cent and 90 per cent loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage loans under the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) in each of the past five years, and the respective percentages of such numbers in the total number of new mortgage loans approved each year; among the applicants for 80 per cent and 90 per cent LTV mortgage loans, of the number of young applicants aged under 40;

President,

 Since taking office, the current-term Government has actively implemented multiple measures to ""enhance speed, quantity, efficiency and quality"" in public housing supply. With our unremitting efforts, the problem of back-loaded public housing supply has completely turned around. Coupled with 30 000 Light Public Housing units, the total public housing supply in the coming five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30) will reach 197 000 units, which is 85 per cent higher than that of the first five year period since the current-term Government took office (i.e. 2022-23 to 2026-27), providing a solid foundation for citizens to live and work in contentment. The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has also been striving to enhance the housing ladder by assisting low- to middle-income families to purchase their own homes through the sale of subsidised sale flats (SSF), and encouraging them to move up the housing ladder as appropriate according to their own affordability.

 We notice that many young people are working hard to achieve upward mobility through accumulation of experience and savings. Among buyers of various types of SSF, young people under the age of 40 have always been the majority. For instance, nearly half of the successful applicants for first-hand Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats are under the age of 40. Around 80 per cent of applicants and buyers under the White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) are also young people under the age of 40. In fact, the selling prices of SSF are affordable for young people. Taking HOS 2024 as an example, after applying the affordability benchmarks calculation, the flats are sold at around 70 per cent of the market price. Based on the average selling price, a flat of about 380 square feet in saleable area costs only around $2.7 million. As the HA provides a mortgage default guarantee for buyers of SSF, generally, White Form buyers can secure a mortgage loan at 90 per cent of the flat price. Assuming an interest rate at 3.5 per cent and a 30-year mortgage term, young people would only need to make a down payment of about $270,000, with monthly mortgage payments of $10,900, to become homeowners.

 To further assist young people, the HA has introduced a series of measures to facilitate their flat purchase. First, starting from the next HOS sale exercise, the HA will allocate an extra ballot number to young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 with White Form status. As for the secondary market, starting from WSM 2024, the HA has increased the quota to 6 000 by 1 500, all of which will be allocated to young family and one-person applicants under the age of 40.

 Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS), as a close partner of the Government in housing policies, also fully supports the Government's relevant housing initiatives in helping young people realise their home ownership aspirations, including the allocation of an additional ballot number to White Form young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 for the purchase of SSF. The HKHS will continue to make reference to the relevant arrangements of the HA and actively work towards the same.

 In addition, the Government also assists those higher-income persons who are not eligible for HOS and yet cannot afford private housing to achieve their home ownership aspirations through Starter Homes for Hong Kong Residents (SH) projects. Apart from the first two SH projects offered for sale by the Urban Renewal Authority (i.e. eResidence Towers 1 and 2, as well as eResidence Tower 3) with a total of over 600 SH units sold, the Government is also taking forward a few other SH projects, which will provide a total of around 5 000 SH units from the next few years onwards. Amongst applicants and final purchasers of SH units offered for sale in the past, around 85 per cent were youth aged 40 or below.

 Besides providing various types of subsidised housing, the Government has also implemented other measures to assist citizens in home purchase. The current-term Government has since February 2024 abolished all demand-side management measures for residential properties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also since October 2024 adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans. The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit were reverted to the pre-2009 levels before the countercyclical macroprudential measures were first introduced, with the maximum LTV ratio for all residential properties adjusted to 70 per cent, regardless of the value of the property, and the DSR limit adjusted to 50 per cent, providing facilitation to persons with different needs for property purchase. Individuals may also obtain high LTV ratio mortgage loans through the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) according to their own needs. In particular, for first-time homebuyers with regular income purchasing properties priced at $10 million or below, the LTV ratio can be up to 90 per cent, which greatly reduces their down payment burden. Meanwhile, to provide comprehensive support for citizens and young people who have aspirations in purchasing flats, the Government has since February 26, 2025 adjusted the value bands of Ad Valorem Stamp Duty payable for sale and purchase or transfer of residential and non-residential properties, raising the maximum value of properties chargeable to $100 stamp duty from $3 million to $4 million. As for SSF, since most units are priced below $4 million (taking HOS 2024 as an example, the average selling price is around $2.7 million), buyers may thus benefit from the aforementioned reduction in stamp duty to $100, with savings to nearly $60,000.

 In consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, our reply to the questions raised by the Hon Kenneth Leung is as follows:

(1) During the application period of WSM 2024, the HA received a total of around 34 000 applications.

For first-time homebuyers with fixed salaries, the maximum LTV ratio can even reach 90 per cent, substantially reducing the down payment burden for homebuyers.

 The numbers of new loans drawn down under the MIP in the past five years (categorised by LTV ratio), and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 2.

 Among above new loans drawn down, the numbers of cases involving at least one homeowner aged below 40, and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (categorised by LTV ratio) (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 3.

LCQ17: Repair and maintenance of external walls of buildings,2025-07-30 17:30,2025-07-30 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000592.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hok-fung and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

Some flat owners of buildings in old districts have relayed to me that titles to the external walls of many buildings in Hong Kong are held by the original developers of those buildings. However, quite a number of these developers have ceased operations over the years following completion of the buildings. The Government has assumed ownership of the external walls of buildings held by some of such developers after their liquidation. There are also cases in which the external walls of buildings are left unattended, be turned into ""abandoned structures"" and become dilapidated. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the number of private buildings in Hong Kong where titles to their external walls are not unified (including buildings with incomplete titles to part or the whole of their external walls); of the number of private buildings with titles to their external walls taken over by the Government due to the fact that the developer concerned has gone into liquidation, and the government departments involved in managing such titles, together with a breakdown of the names and numbers of such buildings by District Council (DC) district;

(2) how the Government will handle the issue concerning the responsibilities for repair and maintenance of the external walls arising from private buildings with incomplete titles to their external walls and those with titles to their external walls taken over by the Government as mentioned in (1), e.g. whether the Government has transferred the titles to the external walls under its possession to the owners' corporations (OC(s)) of the relevant buildings at nominal cost; if so, of the number of successful cases of title transfer, and the number of OCs refusing acceptance of such transfer, together with a breakdown by DC district;

(3) of the measures in place to ensure structural safety of the external walls of the buildings where titles to the external walls have been taken over by the Government; whether there have been cases in the past five years where dilapidated external walls of such buildings caused injuries to pedestrians and the Government was required to assume responsibility for compensation; if so, of the details; and

(4) how the Government will handle the situation mentioned in (1) above in which the titles to the external walls of buildings are incomplete while their external walls are posing immediate danger; whether the Government has assumed any responsibility for repair and maintenance and paid for the relevant works; if so, of the total amount of repairs or maintenance costs incurred by the Government in the past, together with a breakdown by DC district?

Reply:

President,

The Government has all along been emphasising that building owners should properly maintain and repair their buildings. Apart from extending the life of their buildings, danger to the occupants or the general public arising from dilapidation can also be avoided. Generally speaking, the Deeds of Mutual Covenant (DMCs) of a building, being a private contract, stipulate the rights and obligations among the parties concerned (i.e. owners, managers and developers), including management of the common parts of buildings and other related matters, as well as bearing of the relevant maintenance costs, etc. Some DMCs also specify the titles to and the management right of external walls. In fact, owners may manage the common parts (including external walls) of their buildings and other related matters by forming owners' corporations (OCs), owners' committees and engaging licensed property management companies.

The Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) also stipulates the responsibilities for management and maintenance of the common parts of a property. Moreover, the Urban Renewal Authority has launched an all-in-one Integrated Building Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme, providing financial assistance and technical support to building owners, including support for owners to carry out comprehensive maintenance works for the common areas of their buildings. The Home Affairs Department also provides assistance and support to OCs in handling building management matters (including maintenance of the external walls of buildings).

Our reply, prepared in consultation with the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Chan is as follows:

(1) As the titles to different parts of buildings and the responsibilities for managing their common parts are stipulated in the DMCs, which are private contractual agreements, the Government has not compiled statistics on the number of private buildings in Hong Kong where titles to their external walls are not unified (including buildings with incomplete titles to part or the whole of their external walls).

For properties owned by companies, if the company, pursuant to the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) or the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32), completes the procedures for winding up and is about to dissolve, every property and right (such as including some properties that are yet to be sold in the market) vested in or held on trust for the company immediately before the dissolution is vested in the Government as bona vacantia. Among these, land properties are ""bona vacantia properties"" (including their external walls). In general, the Lands Department (LandsD) will dispose of the titles to the external walls (bona vacantia external walls) of the aforesaid buildings which are vested in the Government as bona vacantia by way of sale (please see part (2) for details). Unsold bona vacantia external walls will continue to be managed by the LandsD.

As of June 2025, there are a total of 56 cases involving bona vacantia external walls which have been taken over and are still managed by the LandsD, the details of which (by District Council district) are set out at Annex 1. Given some of the bona vacantia external walls taken over by the LandsD only account for a portion of the overall ownership of the external walls, the LandsD will shoulder the management and maintenance responsibilities corresponding to its share of interests in the external walls in accordance with the DMCs.

(2) In general, the LandsD will dispose of bona vacantia properties that it has taken over by way of sale. However, as the titles to external walls are not suitable for sale in the open market, the LandsD will normally invite the OC of the buildings concerned to take over the ownership of bona vacantia external walls at a nominal fee (i.e. $1,000). Since 2010, the LandsD has successfully transferred the titles of 24 cases of bona vacantia external walls to the OCs of the buildings concerned by sale. A list of these buildings is set out at Annex 2.

Among the 56 cases of bona vacantia external walls currently managed by the LandsD as mentioned in part (1), the LandsD has officially invited the OCs of the buildings concerned to take over the titles of 13 cases, but the OCs have yet to respond. A list of the buildings concerned is set out at Annex 3. The LandsD is arranging initial negotiation with the relevant OCs regarding the transfer of titles for the other 42 cases. As for the remaining case, there is no plan for transfer for the time being as no OC has been formed in the building. So far, no OC has explicitly rejected the offer regarding bona vacantia external walls, and the LandsD will continue to negotiate with the relevant OCs on the transfer matters.

Generally speaking, for buildings where titles to their external walls are not unified (i.e. not held by a single owner or company) or are incomplete (e.g. individual titles are unclear), the OCs or the owners should jointly negotiate and bear the responsibilities for management and maintenance of external walls in accordance with the DMCs.

(3) For bona vacantia external walls managed by the LandsD, the department bears the same responsibilities as other owners. The LandsD staff will inspect the conditions of external walls on a regular basis and, if necessary, will arrange for works contractors to carry out repairs as appropriate to ensure their structural safety and that they are in a good state. According to the records of the LandsD, there has not been any case of injuries to pedestrians due to dilapidation of bona vacantia external walls under its management.

(4) The Buildings Department (BD) has been adopting a multi-pronged approach to ensure the safety of private buildings. Regardless of ownership status, if it is found that a building, including its external walls, poses an imminent danger to the public, the BD will arrange for government contractors to carry out emergency works and subsequently recover the relevant works costs, supervision fees, and surcharges from the owners. In other words, the relevant fees should be ultimately borne by the owners, rather than the BD.

Regarding the bona vacantia external walls managed by the LandsD mentioned in part (1) above, none of the concerned cases require intervention or repair works by the BD due to imminent danger."
立法會十七題：維修大廈外牆,2025-07-30 17:30,2025-07-30 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000601.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上陳學鋒議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

有舊區樓宇單位業主向本人反映，本港不少大廈外牆的業權為該幢大廈的原發展商持有，但物業落成多年後，不少發展商已停止運作，部分該等發展商清盤後其持有的大廈外牆業權由政府接管，亦有部分大廈外牆無人管理變成「無主孤魂」而開始日久失修。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計全港有多少幢私人大廈的外牆沒有統一的業權持有人（包括部分或整體外牆業權不完整的大廈）；有多少幢私人大廈的外牆業權因發展商清盤而由政府接管，以及參與管理該等業權的政府部門為何，並按區議會分區列出該等大廈名稱及數目；

（二）政府如何處理第（一）項所述的外牆業權不完整的私人大廈及政府接管外牆業權的私人大廈所衍生的外牆維修責任，例如有否將政府管有的外牆業權以象徵式費用售予有關大廈的業主立案法團（法團）；若有，轉售業權的成功個案數目為何，以及有多少個法團拒絕接收該等外牆業權，並按區議會分區列出分項資料；

（三）有何措施確保外牆業權已由政府接收的大廈外牆結構安全；過去五年有否發生該等大廈外牆失修而導致途人受傷，並須政府承擔賠償責任的個案；若有，詳情為何；及

（四）政府如何處理屬第（一）項所述外牆業權不完整大廈而其外牆出現即時危險的情況；政府是否曾承擔有關維修責任並支付費用；若是，過往政府承擔的維修總金額為何，並按區議會分區列出分項資料？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直強調樓宇業主應妥善保養和維修樓宇，除了可延長樓宇的壽命，亦可避免因日久失修對住戶或公眾構成危險。一般而言，大廈公契作為私人合約訂明締約各方（即業主、經理人和發展商）之間的權利和責任，包括管理樓宇公用部分和其他相關事宜，以及相關維修費用的負擔等，部分公契亦會訂明外牆的業權和管理權。實際上，業主可透過成立業主立案法團（法團）、業主委員會，以及聘用持牌物業管理公司的方式，管理大廈公用部分（包括外牆）以及其他相關事宜。

《建築物管理條例》（第344章）亦有對管理和維修物業公用部分的責任作出規定。另外，市區重建局推行的樓宇復修綜合支援計劃，為樓宇業主提供財政資助和技術支援的一站式服務，包括支援業主為樓宇公用地方進行全面復修工程。民政事務總署亦會協助及支援法團，協助他們處理樓宇的管理事宜（包括樓宇外牆維修）。

就陳議員各部分的提問，經諮詢民政及青年事務局後，現回覆如下：

（一）由於樓宇不同部分的業權及其公用部分的管理責任由公契訂明，屬於私人合約協議，政府沒有統計全港有多少幢私人大廈的外牆沒有統一的業權持有人（包括部分或整體外牆業權不完整的大廈）。

由公司持有的物業，如果該公司根據《公司條例》（第622章）或《公司（清盤及雜項條文）條例》（第32章）完成清盤程序並面臨解散，則在緊接解散前歸屬該公司或以信託形式為該公司持有的所有財產及權利（例如包括一些仍未在市場售出的物業），即屬無主財物並歸屬政府，其中的土地物業，即為「無主物業」（包括大廈外牆）。地政總署一般會以出售方式處理上述屬無主財物並歸屬政府的大廈外牆（無主外牆）的業權（詳見第二部分）。仍未售出的無主外牆，則會由地政總署繼續管理。

截至二○二五年六月，被地政總署接管並仍由其管理的無主外牆個案共有56宗，（按區議會分區）詳情載列於附件一。由於部分由地政總署接管的無主外牆只佔外牆整體業權的一部分，地政總署會根據大廈公契，按其接管的外牆的權益份額而承擔相應的管理及維修責任。

（二）地政總署一般會以出售方式處理其接管的無主物業，但由於外牆的業權不適合在公開市場出售，署方一般會邀請相關的大廈法團以象徵式費用（即1,000元）承接無主外牆的業權。自二○一○年至今，地政總署已成功將24宗無主外牆的業權轉售相關大廈法團，有關大廈名單詳列於附件二。

至於在第（一）部分提及的56宗現由地政總署管理的無主外牆個案中，地政總署已就當中13宗正式邀請大廈法團承接業權，但尚待相關法團回覆，有關樓宇大廈名單詳列於附件三；地政總署另正就42宗安排與相關法團就轉讓事宜進行初步磋商；餘下一宗個案則因大廈未有成立法團而暫未有轉售的計劃。至今沒有法團明確拒絕地政總署就無主外牆個案發出的邀請，地政總署會繼續與相關法團磋商轉讓事宜。

若果有大廈的外牆業權不統一（即並非由單一業主或公司持有）或不完整（例如有個別業權不清），一般而言，業主須根據大廈公契，由法團或業主共同磋商及承擔有關外牆管理及維修的責任。

（三）就由地政總署管理的無主外牆而言，地政總署的責任與其他業主無異。地政總署人員會定期視察外牆的狀況，如有需要，會安排工程承辦商進行適當維修，以確保其結構安全及妥當。根據地政總署的紀錄，由地政總署管理的無主外牆過往從未出現因失修以致途人受傷的個案。

（四）屋宇署一直採取多管齊下的措施保障私人樓宇的建築安全。不論業權狀況如何，如發現樓宇包括外牆對公眾構成即時危險，署方會安排政府承建商進行緊急工程，並在完成緊急工程後向業主追討工程的相關費用、監督費及附加費。換言之，有關費用最終應該是由業主而非署方承擔。

就上述第（一）部分提及由地政總署管理的無主外牆，並沒有出現即時危險而需由屋宇署介入或代維修的個案。"

(2) Renting at upset prices on first-come, first-served basis

The tenancy agreement of market stalls renting on a first-come, first-served basis is a three-year fixed term from October 1, with no right of renewal upon expiry of the tenancy agreement.

A spokesman for the FEHD said, ""Bidders or applicants for the market stalls must be at least 18 years old and ordinarily reside in Hong Kong. To allow more people to bid for or select the stalls and increase customer choices by enhancing the diversity in terms of the variety of stalls, there will be a restriction on the number of stalls to be rented in the same market by a single tenant. Any person who is currently a stall tenant is not allowed to bid in the first round of auction for any stall in the same market, and will only be allowed to bid for one stall in the second round of auction or to select one stall in the same market on a first-come, first-served basis. The existing tenants under the new three-year fixed term tenancy scheme (i.e. those persons who became stall tenants through the market open auctions after August 2022) are allowed to bid for a stall in the auction or select a stall on a first-come, first-served basis in the same market, but shall vacate the current stall and return it to the FEHD before the effective date of commencement of the new tenancy agreement.""

âDetails of the open auctions and the public market stalls concerned (including stalls for open auction at reduced upset prices) have been uploaded to the FEHD website (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pleasant_environment/tidy_market/open_auction_coming.html). Details on renting public market stalls on a first-come, first-served basis will be uploaded to the FEHD website after open auctions (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pleasant_environment/tidy_market/FCFS/index.html).

政府發言人表示：「特區政府繼二○二一年後，再度發表相關報告。新一份報告以扎實的事實和數據，有系統地向外界清晰說明香港這幾年在社會穩定下來、走出疫情以後，持續向好的發展，讓世界各地的朋友及投資者，更深入了解香港不同領域的實況，鼓勵他們充分利用香港在『一國兩制』下內聯外通的獨特優勢，以及『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的功能，為他們所帶來的龐大機遇。」

報告詳述香港在「一國兩制」下的制度優勢，並說明政府推動經濟高質量發展的政策重點與成果，包括持續提升競爭力，以及吸引資金流入、匯聚企業、吸納人才的成績等，並展示香港在金融、貿易、航空、航運、創科、知識產權貿易、法律服務，以及文化、體育和旅遊等領域的最新發展和潛力。

發言人說：「這幾年來，《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》的實施讓香港重建安全穩定的環境，不僅保障了市民大眾的權利和自由，同時也讓香港成為更能吸引國際資金和投資的安全港。從資金持續流入、股市穩步上揚、海內外企業紛紛落戶香港、人才踴躍來港發展，以至香港在多項國際排名中名列前茅等，種種事實說明香港開放、安全、穩定、和高效的營商環境在國際間獲得廣泛認同，國際投資者和企業對香港的信心正進一步提升。」

事實上，本屆政府在招商引資、吸納人才方面，成績亮麗。例如，二○二四年，有香港境外母公司的駐港公司數目大幅增長約10%，總數接近10 000間，初創企業數目則接近4 700間，兩項數字均創歷年新高。引進重點企業辦公室成立兩年多，已引進84間重點企業來港開設或擴展業務，當中包括市值或估值過百億元，並擁有行內前沿技術的企業。而投資推廣署自二○二三年一月至二○二五年上半年，協助超過1 300間內地和海外企業在港開設或擴展業務，帶來超過1,600億元的投資。

人才方面，截至二○二五年六月，各項人才入境計劃共收到近50萬宗申請，當中近33萬宗獲批，近22萬人已經到港。

今年，香港金融市場的表現也穩步向上，繼去年恒生指數上升18%，今年至今上升超過25%，股市首半年每日成交額上升120%至約2,400億元。本月證券及期貨事務監察委員會公布的《2024年資產及財富管理活動調查》顯示本港資產管理業務進一步增長，截至去年底資產管理總值超過35萬億元，按年增加13%。

發言人說：「面對複雜多變的外圍環境，香港經濟結構正在升級轉型，但機遇大於挑戰。香港有國家作為強大後盾，政府、各界和市民共同努力，用好『一國兩制』的獨特優勢，把握國家發展機遇，大力發展科技創新和培育新質生產力，深化國際和區域交往合作，必定可以發展新的增長點，為香港開創新局面。」"
"Government releases ""Report on Hong Kong's Business Environment: Unique Strengths under 'One Country, Two Systems'"" (with photos/video)",2025-07-30 16:45,2025-07-30 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000631.htm,"  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (July 30) releasedthe ""Report on Hong Kong's Business Environment: Unique Strengths under 'One Country, Two Systems'"". The report provides all sectors of the community and Mainland and overseas investors with details on Hong Kong's latest developments and strengths, comprehensively showcasing Hong Kong's open, safe, stable, efficient and internationalised business environment. The report has been uploaded to the ""Hong Kong Economy"" website: www.hkeconomy.gov.hk/en/environment/index.htm.

   A Government spokesman said, ""Following the report issued in 2021, the HKSAR Government has published another relevant report. With solid facts and data, the latest report systematically and clearly demonstrates to the world that Hong Kong's development has been picking up in recent years as social stability has been restored and the city has emerged from the pandemic. It aims to deepen the understanding of friends and investors worldwide about the latest situation in various fields in Hong Kong, encouraging them to fully leverage Hong Kong's unique advantages of having connections to both the Mainland and the world under 'one country, two systems', its role as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder', and to seize new opportunities that emerge.""

  The report elaborates on Hong Kong's institutional advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement and explains the Government's policy priorities and achievements in promoting high-quality economic development, including continuously strengthening competitiveness, as well as its achievements in attracting capital inflows, pooling together enterprises and attracting talent. It also showcases Hong Kong's latest developments and potential in finance, trade, aviation, maritime, innovation and technology, intellectual property trade, and legal services, as well as culture, sports and tourism.

  The spokesman said, ""Over the past few years, the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance has restored a stable social environment in Hong Kong. This has not only protected the rights and freedoms of the general public but has also made Hong Kong a safe harbour for attracting international capital and investment. The continued inflow of capital, the promising growth of the stock market, domestic and overseas companies setting up their presence in Hong Kong, talent pursuing development in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's top rankings in numerous international rankings demonstrate that Hong Kong's open, secure, stable and efficient business environment has been widely recognised internationally, and the confidence of international investors and businesses in Hong Kong is further growing.""

  In fact, the current-term Government has achieved remarkable results in attracting enterprises, investment and talent. For example, in 2024, the number of companies in Hong Kong with parent companies located outside the territory significantly increased by about 10 per cent, reaching nearly 10 000, while the number of start-ups reached nearly 4 700, both reaching record highs. The Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, established over two years ago, has attracted 84 strategic enterprises to set up or expand their business in Hong Kong, including enterprises with a market capitalisation or valuation exceeding $10 billion and engaged in cutting-edge technologies. From January 2023 to the first six months of 2025, Invest Hong Kong assisted over 1 300 overseas and Mainland companies to set up or expand their business in Hong Kong, bringing in investment of more than $160 billion.

  In terms of talent, as of June 2025, a total of nearly 500 000 applications under various talent admission schemes were received, nearly 330 000 of which were approved, and nearly 220 000 talents have arrived in Hong Kong.

  This year, the performance of Hong Kong's financial markets has steadily improved. The Hang Seng Index recorded an increase of 18 per cent last year and an increase of more than 25 per cent this year so far. The average daily turnover in the stock market for the first half of the year was around $240 billion, with an increase of around 120 per cent. According to the Securities and Futures Commission's Asset and Wealth Management Activities Survey 2024 published this month, Hong Kong's asset and wealth management business showed further growth, with total assets under management at over $35 trillion as of end-2024, representing a year-on-year gain of 13 per cent.

  The spokesman said, ""In a complex and volatile external environment, Hong Kong is experiencing economic upgrading and transformation, but there are more opportunities than challenges. With the strong support from our country and the collective efforts of the Government, various sectors and residents, Hong Kong will leverage the advantages of the 'one country, two systems' arrangement and capitalise on national development opportunities. By developing innovation and technology and new quality productive forces, and deepening international and regional exchanges and co-operation, Hong Kong will pave the way for new growth prospects."""

政府發言人表示：「特區政府繼二○二一年後，再度發表相關報告。新一份報告以扎實的事實和數據，有系統地向外界清晰說明香港這幾年在社會穩定下來、走出疫情以後，持續向好的發展，讓世界各地的朋友及投資者，更深入了解香港不同領域的實況，鼓勵他們充分利用香港在『一國兩制』下內聯外通的獨特優勢，以及『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的功能，為他們所帶來的龐大機遇。」

立法會十題：促進虛擬資產的發展,2025-07-30 16:08,2025-07-30 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000308.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上尚海龍議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

特區政府於二○二二年及本年先後發布兩份有關虛擬資產在港發展的政策宣言，明確將香港定位為全球領先的數字資產中心，並推動多項立法及監管措施，包括通過《穩定幣條例草案》及引入虛擬資產服務提供者發牌制度（發牌制度）。然而，有業界人士關注現行政策能否在保障投資者與促進創新之間取得平衡，以及香港如何應對國際競爭（例如美國及新加坡就穩定幣建立監管框架）。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有意見認為在現行發牌制度下，僅有10間來自本地和海外的機構獲批牌照，證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）的審批速度較新加坡等競爭對手緩慢，當局有否制訂具體時間表以進一步簡化發牌程序，以吸引更多合規企業落戶香港；會否參考國際標準（例如歐盟的《加密資產市場監管法案》），制訂更具彈性的監管沙盒機制，鼓勵金融科技試驗；

（二）當局會否在未來三年將代幣化債券的發行常規化，並擴展至其他資產類別（例如房地產或私募基金）；政府會如何解決目前跨機構代幣化標準不統一的問題，例如會否與香港金融管理局、證監會及香港交易及結算所有限公司共同訂立協調機制；及

（三）會否與內地相關機構（例如中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所）及國際組織（例如國際貨幣基金組織）加強合作，建立跨境虛擬資產監管及反洗錢協議？

答覆：

主席：

政府於二○二五年六月發表《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》（《政策宣言2.0》）。《政策宣言2.0》建基於二○二二年十月發表的首份政策宣言，重申政府致力將香港打造成數字資產領域中的全球創新中心。

《政策宣言2.0》其中一方面的重點是優化法律與監管。一套整全的監管框架為數字資產行業的可持續發展提供穩固基礎。繼數字資產交易平台發牌制度於二○二三年六月實施後，《穩定幣條例》將於今年八月一日生效。與此同時，政府與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）正就數字資產交易服務提供者和數字資產託管服務提供者發牌制度諮詢公眾，以期盡快訂定立法建議。在有關立法工作完成後，香港的監管框架將全面涵蓋數字資產行業的主要節點，平衡風險管理和投資者保障，同時為市場發展和金融創新提供有利條件。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢香港金融管理局（金管局），證監會及香港警務處，我現答覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年七月初，證監會已正式發牌予11個來自本地和海外的數字資產交易平台，並正處理另外九個牌照申請。證監會處理數字資產交易平台牌照申請所需的時間受多項因素影響而有所不同，例如申請人所提供的資料是否完備；申請人提供的證明文件是否齊全；及在證監會的評核過程中，申請人就提供任何進一步資料而作出回應的所需時間等。

因應處理數字資產交易平台牌照申請的實際經驗，證監會不時檢視和優化相關程序，促進申請人更有效了解證監會的監管預期，以縮短證監會評估牌照申請所需的時間。就此，證監會於二○二四年六月起推行迅速發牌程序，對被當作獲發牌的數字資產交易平台申請者進行以風險為本的現場視察，與相關申請者的高層及最終控制人就監管標準作直接溝通，縮短了批出相關牌照所需的時間。

其後，證監會於二○二五年一月起，將迅速發牌程序的適用範圍擴展至所有數字資產交易平台牌照的新申請者。在迅速發牌程序下，數字資產交易平台申請者需要先落實內部的政策、程序、系統及監控措施，然後對有關措施進行外部評估。證監會將成為協定的參與方，以監督整個外部評估過程。證監會會持續檢視數字資產交易平台牌照的申請情況，以促進更多不同背景的數字資產交易平台營運者在香港展開相關業務。

另外，為了鼓勵金融創新，金管局、證監會和保險業監管局等監管機構設有不同監管沙盒機制，讓代幣化、區塊鏈，以至生成式人工智能及保險科技等金融科技在實際應用前，在風險可控的情況下測試創新用例，並獲取監管機構的技術支持及監管意見。監管機構設計沙盒時會參考海內外經驗，以締造健康及可持續的市場環境，協助金融機構抓緊機遇，負責任地採用金融科技。

（二）政府在二○二三年和二○二四年先後兩次以代幣化形式發行綠色債券，展示了代幣化方案的效益，並獲市場歡迎。該兩此債券發行分別是全球首批政府代幣化綠色債券及全球首批多幣種數碼原生代幣化債券。政府已在二○二五至二六年度的《財政預算案》中宣布將代幣化債券發行恒常化，而金管局目前正為第三次發行作準備。

正如《政策宣言2.0》所述，政府明白傳統金融產品及現實世界資產代幣化的潛力。政府亦留意到金融機構對於將傳統金融工具代幣化的興趣日趨濃厚，而探討將證券代幣化和向客戶分銷代幣化證券的中介人亦不斷增加。事實上，證監會於二○二三年十一月發出《有關中介人從事代幣化證券相關活動的通函》及《有關代幣化證監會認可投資產品的通函》，藉此向中介人提供指引，以妥善管理代幣化技術和相關投資產品所帶來的新風險，促進代幣化市場穩健、負責任及可持續發展。

建基於上述基礎，證監會在二○二四年已經認可了首項可供香港散戶買賣的代幣化投資產品，該黃金代幣允許投資者購買實金擁有權的一部分。證監會更在二○二五年第一季度認可了亞太區首批三隻容許散戶投資的代幣化貨幣市場基金，截至二○二五年三月底，這些基金的管理資產總值超過七億元。

與此同時，透過金管局的Ensemble項目，我們積極鼓勵創新應用場景，包括代幣化傳統金融產品（如貨幣市場基金及其他基金）以及現實世界資產（如電動車充電站）的收益流。而證監會亦為Ensemble項目的主要合作夥伴，與金管局共同促進資產管理行業相關代幣化的廣泛應用。金管局亦正探索建立創新的金融市場基礎設施，並提供統一的技術基礎，促進銀行間代幣化存款的結算。

（三）香港一直積極參與國際間有關打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的工作，包括與數字資產相關的標準制訂和監管工作。其中，香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度獲負責制訂相關國際標準的財務行動特別組織確認為整體合規而有效，而在國際合作方面取得的成效尤其顯著。

目前，香港正參與財務行動特別組織轄下的虛擬資產工作小組的討論，以了解相關最新的洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險，並促進國際間在有關方面的合作。金管局亦同時牽頭金融穩定理事會對加密資產活動全球監管框架在全球各地實施情況的檢討工作。

另外，香港警務處轄下的聯合財富情報組是國際金融情報組織埃格蒙特組織的成員，與組織當中超過160個來自世界各地的財富情報單位交換資訊，合力支援跨司法管轄區的執法和交換情報工作，促進國際間有關打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（包括涉及數字資產的案件）的執法工作。

與此同時，內地、香港特別行政區與澳門特別行政區三地與反洗錢相關的部門已建立機制，就有關工作定期交流與保持緊密協作。

財經事務及庫務局、金融監管機構和執法機構會繼續密切留意有關洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集和數字資產的風險，持續與相關的國際組織和其他司法管轄區（包括內地）的相關機構保持緊密溝通與合作。

香港亦一直就數字資產監管及發展與各地監管機構保持密切溝通。隨着全球主要地區逐步推動與數字資產相關的監管制度，香港將繼續與國際社會互相交流監管經驗，強化跨境監管合作，共同促進金融穩定和創新。"
LCQ10: Promoting virtual asset development,2025-07-30 16:08,2025-07-30 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000312.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Shang Hailong and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

 In 2022 and this year, the SAR Government promulgated two policy statements on the development of virtual assets (VA) in Hong Kong respectively, explicitly positioning the city as a premier global hub for digital assets and taking forward various legislative and regulatory measures. These include the passage of the Stablecoins Bill and the introduction of a licensing regime for VA service providers (the licensing regime). However, some industry participants have expressed concerns about whether the existing policies can strike an appropriate balance between investor protection and innovation promotion, and how Hong Kong will address international competition (such as the regulatory frameworks for stablecoins established by the United States and Singapore). In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as there are views that under the existing licensing regime, only 10 institutions from both local and overseas markets have been granted licences, and that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)'s approval speed lags behind that of competitors such as Singapore, whether the authorities have drawn up a specific timetable to further streamline the licensing process, in order to attract more compliant enterprises to establish a presence in Hong Kong; whether it will draw reference from international standards (such as the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) to develop a more flexible regulatory sandbox mechanism that encourage trials of financial technology;

(2) whether the authorities will, within the next three years, regularise the issuance of tokenised bonds and extend this to other asset classes (such as real estate or private equity funds); how the Government will resolve the current lack of uniformity in cross-institutional tokenisation standards, for example, whether it will establish a co-ordination mechanism jointly with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, SFC and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited; and

(3) whether it will strengthen co-operation with relevant Mainland institutions (such as the Digital Currency Institute of the People's Bank of China) and international organisations (such as the International Monetary Fund), in order to establish cross-boundary agreements on VA regulation and anti-money laundering initiatives?

Reply:

President,

 The Government issued the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong (Policy Statement 2.0) in June 2025. Building on the first policy statement released in October 2022, Policy Statement 2.0 reaffirms the Government's commitment to positioning Hong Kong as a global hub for innovation in the digital asset field.

 One of the key focuses of Policy Statement 2.0 is enhancing the legal and regulatory framework. A comprehensive regulatory framework provides a solid foundation for the sustainable development of the digital asset sector. Following the implementation of the licensing regime for digital asset trading platforms in June 2023, the Stablecoins Ordinance will come into effect on August 1 this year. At the same time, the Government and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) are consulting the public on the licensing regimes for digital asset dealing service and custodian service providers, with a view to formulating the legislative proposals as soon as practicable. Upon the completion of the legislative work, the regulatory framework in Hong Kong will provide comprehensive coverage of the key nodes of the digital asset industry, balancing risk management and investor protection, while providing favourable conditions for market development and financial innovation.

 After consulting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the SFC, and the Hong Kong Police Force, our reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) As of early July 2025, the SFC has officially granted licences to 11 digital asset trading platforms with both local and overseas background, and is processing an additional nine licence applications. The time required to process licence applications regarding digital asset trading platform varies, depending on various factors such as the completeness of the information provided by the applicants, the adequacy of the supporting documents submitted by the applicants, and the time taken by the applicants to respond to requests for further information during the SFC's assessment process.

 Based on the practical experience in processing licence applications, the SFC from time to time reviews and enhances relevant procedures to help applicants better understand the SFC's regulatory expectations, thereby reducing the time required for licence assessments. In this regard, the SFC launched a swift licensing process in June 2024, under risk-based on-site inspections would be conducted on those deemed-to-be-licensed digital asset trading platform applicants. During the process, the SFC would communicate direct with the senior management and ultimate controllers of the relevant applicants about regulatory standards, so as to reduce the time required for granting relevant licences.

 Subsequently, the SFC expanded in January 2025 the scope of the swift licensing process to include all new applicants for a digital asset trading platform licence. Under the swift licensing process, applicants are required to first establish internal policies, procedures, systems and monitoring measures, which must then undergo external assessment. The SFC acts as one of the parties overseeing the entire external assessment process. The SFC continues to review the circumstances in respect of applications for a digital asset trading platform licence, with a view to facilitating more digital asset trading platform operators from diverse backgrounds to commence business in Hong Kong.

 In addition, to promote financial innovation, regulatory authorities such as the HKMA, the SFC, and the Insurance Authority have established various regulatory sandbox mechanisms. These enable innovative use cases in tokenisation, blockchain, generative AI (artificial intelligence) and insurance technology to be tested under a risk-controlled environment before their actual application, while receiving technical support and regulatory feedback from the regulatory authorities. The design of these sandboxes has taken reference to both local and overseas experience to foster a healthy and sustainable environment for the market, helping financial institutions seize opportunities and responsibly adopt financial technologies.

(2) The Government made two issuances of tokenised green bonds in 2023 and 2024, which demonstrated the benefits of tokenisation and were well received by the market. The two issuances represented the first tokenised green bond issued by a government and the first multi-currency digitally native tokenised bonds in the world respectively. In the 2025-26 Budget, the Government announced the regularisation of tokenised bond issuance, and the HKMA is currently preparing for the third issuance.

 As highlighted in Policy Statement 2.0, the Government recognises the potential of tokenisation of traditional financial products and real-world assets. The Government has also observed growing interest among financial institutions in tokenising traditional financial instruments, and that more and more intermediaries are exploring tokenisation of securities and distributing tokenised securities. In fact, the SFC issued ""Circular on intermediaries engaging in tokenised securities-related activities"" and ""Circular on tokenisation of SFC-authorised investment products"" in November 2023, providing guidance to intermediaries on managing new risks posed by tokenisation technology and related investment products, thereby promoting the steady, responsible and sustainable development of the tokenisation market.

 Building on the above, the SFC authorised in 2024 the first tokenised investment product for retail access in Hong Kong. That is a gold token that allows investors to acquire fractional ownership of physical gold. In the first quarter of 2025, the SFC further authorised three retail tokenised money market funds, which were the first in the Asia Pacific region. As of the end of March 2025, these funds had a total of over $700 million assets under management.

 Meanwhile, through the HKMA's Project Ensemble, we are actively encouraging innovative use cases, including the tokenisation of traditional financial products (e.g. money market funds and other funds) and revenue streams of real-world assets (e.g. electric vehicle charging stations). The SFC is a key partner of Project Ensemble, and has been working with the HKMA to promote the wider adoption of tokenisation in the asset management industry. The HKMA is also exploring the development of innovative financial market infrastructure, providing a unified technical foundation to facilitate interbank settlement of tokenised deposits.

(3) Hong Kong has been actively participating in international efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, including the development of standards and regulations relating to digital assets. In particular, Hong Kong's regime for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing has been recognised by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the setter of relevant international standards, as both overall compliant and effective, especially in international co-operation.

 Currently, Hong Kong is participating in the discussion of the Virtual Assets Contact Group under the FATF, so as to keep abreast of the latest related risks in respect of money laundering and terrorist financing and to foster international collaboration in this area. Meanwhile, the HKMA is leading the Financial Stability Board's review of the global implementation of the global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities.

 In addition, the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit under the Hong Kong Police Force is a member of the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, exchanging information with over 160 member financial intelligence units worldwide. This supports cross-jurisdiction enforcement and intelligence-sharing efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, including cases involving digital assets.

 At the same time, the anti-money laundering related agencies in the Mainland, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macao Special Administrative Region have established mechanisms for regular exchanges and close collaboration.

 The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, financial regulators and law enforcement agencies will continue to monitor the risks associated with money laundering, terrorist financing and digital assets. We will maintain close communication and collaboration with relevant international organisations and relevant agencies in other jurisdictions, including the Mainland.

 Hong Kong has also maintained close communication with regulators around the world on the regulation and developments of digital assets. As major regions around the world gradually implement regulatory regimes related to digital assets, Hong Kong will continue to exchange regulatory experience with the international community, strengthen cross-border/cross-boundary regulatory collaboration, and jointly promote financial stability and innovation."
LCQ5: Establishment of smart education platform and large language models,2025-07-30 16:03,2025-07-30 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000556.htm,"  Following is a question by Professor the Hon William Wong and a reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

  It has been reported that the Mainland has set up a national smart education public service platform (""smart education platform"") covering primary and secondary education, vocational education, higher education and lifelong learning to provide personalised online interactive learning materials along with round-the-clock support for students and continuing education participants. Some members of the community have suggested that the Government should prioritise the establishment of large language models (LLMs) and an education platform applicable in Hong Kong's education system and incorporate therein correct history, culture and values so as to elevate the quality of education and the depth of cultural inheritance in the territory. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the total numbers of educational institutions in Hong Kong (including universities, secondary and primary schools, and vocational education institutions) which have currently established on-premises LLMs for subject-based education;

(2) whether it has plans to develop LLMs of subject-based education with local characteristics for use by students and people pursuing further studies in Hong Kong; if so, when the development will begin; if not, whether it will consider establishing such models; and

(3) given that the Mainland has already established a smart education platform, whether the Government will consider discussing with relevant Mainland authorities the possibility of replicating the platform in Hong Kong and adapting them for use by local educational institutions at various levels, following integration with the local curriculum?

Reply:

President,

  As global digitalisation continues to progress, the Education Bureau (EDB), in line with the national strategy for invigorating the country through science and education, actively promotes education innovation and takes forward digital education in order to nurture future talents to embrace the challenges and opportunities in the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI). With the formation of the Steering Committee on Strategic Development of Digital Education, we have identified the directions and key focus areas for digital education, and are continuously optimising the curricula, strengthening relevant training for teachers, improving digital education infrastructure, enhancing learning platforms and AI technology as well as collaborating with stakeholders from various sectors, with a view to promoting the implementation of digital education and enhancing the quality of local education.

  Our consolidated reply to the question raised by Professor the Hon William Wong is as follows:

  With training in the form of deep learning of massive amounts of text data, large language models (LLMs) are able to generate natural language text and handle various natural language tasks such as text summarisation, questioning and answering, and translation. In the field of education, the application of LLMs serves as a learning and teaching aid which assists teachers in preparing lessons, setting questions and marking assignments on one hand, and help students search for information, obtain writing advice, etc on the other hand. At present, the application of LLMs in teaching is being developed and improved continuously. To effectively enhance the quality of education and the depth of cultural heritage, including incorporating proper values with respect to history and culture through the application of LLMs, it is essential for teachers to apply technology in a professional manner and make reference to resources from local, national and international online platforms, so as to flexibly adopt teaching strategies and design quality learning activities which align with the curriculum and meet the needs of students.

  In this connection, the EDB has been encouraging and supporting schools to explore and adopt diversified and appropriate teaching strategies based on their school contexts and students' learning needs, and to make good use of technology including LLMs. At the same time, schools are encouraged to nurture students' information literacy as well as proper attitudes and values towards the application of innovation and technology (I&T) which align with the aims and objectives of the school curriculum. Currently, some schools in Hong Kong are trying to develop school-based LLMs for application in learning and teaching. While the EDB supports school-based innovation, we do not require all schools to develop their own LLMs for subject-based teaching at the present stage. As such, relevant statistics are not available. To keep abreast of the times, we will closely take heed of the trends in technological development and application, strengthen the professional development of teachers, and review the application of LLMs in a timely manner.

  To promote digital transformation in education, we have allocated $500million under the Quality Education Fund for the implementation of the e-Learning Ancillary Facilities Programme to develop e-learning ancillary facilities that meet local learning and teaching needs. There are a total of 22 funded projects in which I&T such as LLMs are deployed. The deliverables of the projects are to be released in four batches starting from mid-2025 for the use of publicly-funded schools. In fact, schools may utilise different resources such as the Composite Information Technology Grant in a flexible manner according to their school contexts for procuring different digital teaching tools and platforms to tie in with subject teaching and cater for the diverse learning needs of students in learning.

  On resources development, the EDB has been committed to providing schools with quality teaching materials, including learning and teaching resources on different subjects, the Educational MultiMedia and the EDB One-stop Portal for Learning and Teaching Resources, covering the Key Learning Areas and cross-disciplinary subjects or areas at kindergarten, primary and secondary levels. The EDB has also been collaborating with the Hong Kong Education City Limited (HKEdCity) to provide one-stop services on e-learning, e-reading and e-assessment including platforms such as the eRead Scheme and the Student Assessment Repository to meet the needs of local schools, and with the provision of the online learning platform and related courses on AI and computational thinking for students, the aim of sharing resources is achieved.

  Regarding the smart education platform developed by our country, local teachers and students at present can browse around for free without the need to register. However, as the curricula of the two places vary, Hong Kong schools need to make adaptations and relevant technical adjustments when using the platform. The EDB has already liaised with relevant authorities to gain insights into the mode of operation and types of resources provided by the platform. We will also actively study and make reference to the relevant experience of the platform, so as to explore feasible options for the enhancement of local teaching and learning resource platforms to better support learning and teaching. We will continue to strengthen professional teacher training on I&T and AI, optimise the platform of the HKEdCity, make reference to and utilise existing high-quality learning and teaching platforms, LLMs and programmes locally and from our country and overseas, encourage cross-sectoral and cross-school sharing of resources, and explore cost-effective approaches to further support the learning and teaching of digital education in Hong Kong.

  For post-secondary education, with the advent of AI, innovative and breakthrough technology in the new era, post-secondary institutions are encouraged to actively explore and experiment in teaching and learning. Amongst others, the University Grants Committee (UGC) launched the $100 million Fund for Innovative Technology-in-Education in 2023 to provide an impetus for universities to harness innovative and breakthrough technologies in transforming pedagogies and enriching student learning experiences. The eight UGC-funded universities are capitalising on the funding to continuously implement around 100 new projects, with the aim to drive transformation in pedagogies, curricula, assessments, and student development; advance digital competency comprehensively; promote technological social responsibilities and academic integrity; and foster academia-industry collaboration and enhance authentic learning experience. The goal is to nurture university students into a digitally competent and technologically responsible new generation under the digital economy. These projects are underway and expected to be completed in 2026.

  In addition, through targeted support measures, including the Enhancement and Start-up Grant Scheme for Self-financing Post-secondary Education, as well as the Quality Enhancement Support Scheme, we support universities of applied sciences and self-financing post-secondary education institutions to enhance teaching quality by seizing the opportunities arising from technological advancement and make good use of AI.

  In response to the rapid development of AI technologies, the Vocational Training Council (VTC) has also established the Hong Kong Institute of Information Technology (HKIIT), which admitted its first cohort of students in the 2024/25 academic year (AY). The VTC is developing AI-enabled interactive learning materials, including introducing educational chatbots to provide students with instant learning feedback to enhance their learning outcomes. The EDB has been supporting post-secondary institutions to introduce appropriate teaching frameworks and new programmes, so as to enhance support for academic staff and students, and meet ever-changing societal needs. In the 2024/25 AY, there are about 10programmes related to AI offered by the UGC-funded universities. A number of UGC-funded universities have also offered AI-related undergraduate programmes in the 2025-28 triennium in response to the strategic directions set by the Government, for example, ""Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence"" of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and ""Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science"" of the University of Hong Kong.

  As regards the self-financing post-secondary sector, institutions have the flexibility to develop programmes that meet market demands and adjust the curricula and intake places of relevant programmes, in response to the ever-changing manpower needs of society. In the 2024/25 AY, there are a total of 15 post-secondary programmes relating to AI by 10 self-financing institutions. The HKIIT of the VTC also offers a total of 21 programmes in the 2024/25 AY, covering areas including cybersecurity, AI, and software engineering.

  In sum, the EDB will continue to encourage schools to use I&T and keep a close watch on the application and development of I&T in this field, strengthen the exchange and collaboration with partners in the Mainland and overseas to facilitate the high-quality development of digitisation of local education.

  Thank you, President."
立法會五題︰建立智慧教育平台及大語言模型,2025-07-30 16:02,2025-07-30 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000551.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上黃錦輝議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的答覆︰

問題：

據報內地已建立涵蓋中小學、職業教育、高等教育和終身學習的「國家智慧教育公共服務平台」（智慧教育平台），為學生和持續進修人士提供個人化、全天候支援的線上互動學習教材。有社會人士建議，政府應優先建立適用於香港教育體系的大語言模型及教育平台，並融入正確的歷史、文化與價值觀，藉此提升本地教育質素及文化傳承的深度。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計，目前全港共有多少間學校（包括大、中及小學，以及職業教育學校）已在校內建立分科教育的大語言模型；

（二）有否計劃開發供香港學生和進修人士使用，並具本地特色的分科教育大語言模型；如有，何時開始推展；如否，會否考慮建立有關模型；及

（三）鑑於內地已設立智慧教育平台，政府會否考慮與內地相關部門商討，將該平台移植至香港，並在融合本地課程後，供本地各級學校使用？

答覆：

主席：

在全球數字化持續推進，配合國家科教興國戰略，教育局積極推動教育創新，開展數字教育，培育未來人才，迎接人工智能時代的挑戰和機遇。我們通過成立的「數字教育策略發展督導委員會」，訂定數字教育的方向和重點，持續優化課程、加強教師培訓、完善數字教育基礎建設，優化學習平台和人工智能技術等，與各界不同持份者協作，推動數字教育的實踐，提升本地教育質素。

就黃錦輝議員的提問，現綜合回覆如下：

大語言模型通過海量文本數據訓練的深度學習，能夠生成自然語言文本，處理各種自然語言任務，如文本摘要、問答、翻譯等。應用於教育領域，可以輔助教師備課、出題和批改作業，協助學生查索資料、獲得寫作建議等，是輔助教學工具之一。目前，大語言模型於教學上的應用正在不斷發展和完善，要藉以提升教育質素及文化傳承的深度，包括融入正確的歷史、文化價值觀等，有賴教師專業地應用科技，參考本地、國家及其他地方網上平台的資源，配合課程及對應學生需要，靈活運用教學策略，設計優質的學習活動，方能發揮作用。

為此，教育局一直鼓勵及支持學校，因應校情及學生學習需要，探索和採用多元化適切的教學策略，善用科技，包括大語言模型等，同時，配合學校課程的宗旨和目標，培養學生的資訊素養，使用創新科技的正確態度和價值觀。現時，本港部分學校正嘗試建立校本大語言模型，並應用於學與教上。教育局支持校本創新，但現階段並沒有要求所有學校自行建立與分科教學相關的大語言模型，因此，亦未有相關統計數字。我們會密切留意科技發展及應用的趨勢，做好教師專業發展，適時檢視大語言模型的應用，與時並進。

為推動教育數字化轉型，我們透過優質教育基金（基金）撥款五億，推行「電子學習配套計劃」，發展切合本地教學需要的電子學習配套。二十二個獲基金資助的項目，均採用了創新科技，當中包括大語言模型。項目的成果自二○二五年年中開始，分四批發布，供公帑資助學校使用。事實上，學校可因應校情，靈活運用不同資源，如「資訊科技綜合津貼」等，採購不同數字教學工具與平台，配合學科教學和照顧學生多元學習需要。

在資源開發方面，教育局一直致力為學校提供優質的教材，包括不同科目的學與教資源、「教育多媒體」和「教育局一站式學與教資源平台」，涵蓋幼稚園、小學和中學各學習領域及跨學科科目或範疇；又與香港教育城有限公司（教城）合作，提供切合本地學校需要的一站式電子學習、閱讀及評估服務，包括通過「e悅讀學校計劃」、「學生評估資源庫（STAR）」等平台，配合為學生提供的人工智能和運算思維的網上學習平台和有關課程，達至資源共享的目的。

至於國家開發的智慧教育平台，現時本港師生無需登記，可以免費瀏覽；然而，兩地課程不同，本港學校使用上述平台，需進行調適及作相關技術調整。目前，教育局已與智慧教育平台相關部門連繫，了解平台的運作模式與資源類型，並將積極研究及借鑑相關平台的經驗，探討可行方案，優化本地的教學資源平台，更好支援學與教。我們會繼續加強創科及人工智能教育的教師專業培訓，優化教城平台，參考及善用本地、國家及海外的優質學與教平台、大語言模型及程式等，鼓勵跨界別及跨校資源共享，探討具成本效益的模式，進一步支援本港數字教育的學與教。

在專上教育方面，隨着人工智能、創新和突破性科技的湧現，我們鼓勵專上院校在教與學上積極探索及嘗試。其中，大學教育資助委員會（教資會）於二○二三年撥款一億元，設立科教創新基金，鼓勵大學利用創新及突破性科技推進教學革新及豐富學習體驗。八所教資會資助大學正利用撥款，持續推行約100個新項目，達致推動教學法、課程、評估和學生發展的轉型；全面提升數碼素養；推廣科技社會責任和學術誠信；以及促進學術界與產業協作，增強真實學習體驗，務求培養大學生在數字化經濟環境中成為德才兼備的新世代人才等目標。目前，各項目正進行當中，預計將於二○二六年完成。

另外，我們通過針對性的支援措施，包括自資專上教育提升及啟動補助金計劃及質素提升支援計劃等，支持應用科學大學、自資專上院校把握科技發展的機遇，善用人工智能等，提升教學質素。

因應人工智能技術的快速發展，職業訓練局（職訓局）亦成立了香港資訊科技學院，於二○二四／二五學年錄取首屆學生。現時，職訓局正發展人工智能互動學習教材，包括引入教育聊天機械人，為學生提供即時學習回饋，協助他們提升學習成效。教育局一直支持院校推行適切的教學框架及新課程，加強對教學人員及學生的支持，以回應時代轉變，滿足社會需求。在二○二四／二五學年，教資會資助大學已開設約10個與人工智能相關的課程。在二○二五至二八三年期，多所教資會資助大學因應政府的策略方針，推出與人工智能相關的學士學位課程，例如：香港科技大學的「工學士（人工智能）」；香港大學的「文學士及工學學士（人工智能及數據科學）」。

至於自資專上界別，各院校可靈活開辦符合市場需要的課程，調整相關課程的內容及學額，回應社會不斷轉變的人力需求。在二○二四／二五學年，有10所自資院校開辦共15個與人工智能相關的專上課程。職業訓練局的香港資訊科技學院亦已於二○二四／二五學年開辦共21個課程，涵蓋網絡安全、人工智能、軟件工程等領域。

總而言之，教育局會繼續鼓勵學校運用創新科技，亦會密切留意這科技領域的應用與發展，加強與海內外夥伴交流合作，支持本地教育數字化的高質量發展。

多謝主席。"

主席：

我感謝顏汶羽議員提出「完善灣區人才標準，促進區域人才流動」這項議案，並感謝梁子穎議員提出的修正案，讓我們可以就這個議題發表及交流意見。特區政府會仔細聆聽議員的建議。

人才是推動發展的第一資源。特區政府一直以培育本地人才為主，引入外來人才為輔，藉豐富本地人才庫滿足社會經濟發展所需。為應對殷切的人力需求，以對接國家發展新質生產力等重要戰略方向，吸引國際高端人才集聚香港，特區政府一直積極採取多管齊下的策略，在豐富本地人才庫的同時，亦致力深化香港與其他粵港澳大灣區城市人才服務工作的交流和合作，共同推動人才引進、培養和交流，促進多元人才在灣區流動，加快建設大灣區高水平人才高地。

在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》（CEPA）的框架下，內地已在絕大部分的服務貿易領域對香港實施優惠和便利措施，包括放寬香港專業人士提供服務的資質要求、准許香港專業人士在內地參加考試、註冊、執業和開業，以及鼓勵雙方的專業機構進行資格互認。特區政府各政策局及部門一直與內地相關部委和廣東省政府緊密合作，並與各行業組織充分溝通，在多個專業領域，就相關行業致力推動香港與其他大灣區城市的專業人才發展、便捷兩地專業人才資格互認及強化相關標準銜接的工作，為兩地專業人員開拓更廣闊的發展空間。我想藉此機會，簡單介紹相關工作的幾個重點範疇。

在建築及相關工程服務方面，香港的專業學會和內地有關規管機構已就六個專業的職業資格簽署了互認協議。在粵港政府的共同努力下，適用於香港專業人才的職稱評價機制已於二○二三年成功制訂。試點職稱評價開創香港專業人士獲取內地職稱的創新機制，是兩地專業資格領域規則銜接的重大突破。融入內地職稱評價系統，有助香港專業人才的技術水平和資歷在內地市場獲得認可。

在金融服務領域方面，政府致力為兩地業界建立人才互通的橋樑。在CEPA框架下，內地與香港已就不同金融服務業的專業及行業資格推出開放措施，有利於內地金融人才來港發展。舉例來說，內地的證券、基金或期貨專業人員可獲證券及期貨事務監察委員會視作符合香港的牌照資格要求；而在銀行業，兩地從業人員亦可在資格互認機制下考取「雙資格」，提升專業競爭力。

法律服務方面，在CEPA《服務貿易協議》新增的大灣區內地城市先行先試的開放措施下，符合條件的香港律師和大律師在通過粵港澳大灣區律師執業考試並取得律師執業證（粵港澳大灣區）後，可以在大灣區內地九市辦理適用內地法律的部分民商事法律事務。爭議解決服務方面，政府亦與粵澳法律部門合作，發布了粵港澳大灣區調解員名冊，為整合大灣區調解人才奠定基礎。

除了上述領域，各政策局及部門均在各自範疇積極推展工作，促進其他專業人才在灣區流動，例如醫務及護理服務方面，在CEPA框架下，已有12類香港註冊醫療衞生專業人員可到內地短期執業。在資歷框架合作上，香港學術及職業資歷評審局亦協助及支援廣東省建立其終身教育資歷框架，長遠為粵港兩地資歷架構／框架的進一步交流和合作建立基礎，便利兩地在人才培訓方面的探索。

剛才介紹的，只是特區政府相關工作的一部分。政府的目標是要發揮香港「一國兩制」的獨特優勢，擔當國際人才樞紐和國家人才門戶的雙重角色，發揮「引進來、走出去」的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」角色，加強人才資格互認及標準銜接的工作，促進灣區人才流動，加快發展新質生產力，推動高質量發展。

主席，我會仔細聆聽議員的發言，並在總結時再就議員的意見作出回應。

多謝主席。"

有意見認為近年公共租住房屋公屋（公屋）居民對香港房屋委員會（房委會）提供的管理服務有不同意見，惟現行房委會的意見收集渠道卻未夠全面。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年公屋居民透過電話熱線、屋邨管理諮詢委員會及郵寄等途徑向房委會提交的意見總數分別為何，並按意見性質（例如公屋維修、環境衞生和社區設施等）列出分項數字；

（二）當局有否評估現行意見收集機制的成效（例如房委會回覆意見的平均時間、所提問題的解決率，以及居民滿意度等）為何；若有評估，具體指標及結果為何；若否，會否考慮設立評估機制；

（三）鑑於有長者及殘疾人士反映房委會設立的意見反饋渠道不足，房委會會否為特定人士設立便利化的意見反饋措施（例如上門收集意見、簡化意見收集表格及提供語音輸入系統等）；若有，推行時間表為何；若否，原因為何；

（四）當局有否計劃開發電子平台整合與各區公屋管理有關的意見數據，並利用人工智能分析並識別最多人關注的議題，以及預測公屋管理上的潛在問題；若有，詳情及預計實施時間表為何；若否，原因及所涉的困難為何；

（五）會否參考私人物業管理的標準，要求房委會定期公布全港公屋居民就公屋管理的意見的綜合分析報告，包括他們的主要訴求趨勢，以及房委會就該等意見所採取的跟進改善方案；及

（六）會否考慮定期組織交流會，與地區持份者（包括區議員、分區委員會、地區撲滅罪行委員會及地區防火委員會、地區服務及關愛隊伍、業主立案法團及居民代表等）交流屋苑的管理意見？

答覆：

主席：

香港房屋委員會（房委會）一直本着「關懷為本」的信念，致力為居民提供優質公共租住房屋（公屋），透過專業管理及維修保養，秉持為民盡責的基本信念，為居民締造良好的居住環境。公營房屋的居民是我們重要的服務對象，我們非常重視居民的期望及需要，我們會持續與居民及地區持份者保持聯繫，並會透過不同渠道收集居民的意見，聆聽居民及地區持份者就改善公營房屋居民生活質素方面的意見，以提升居民的幸福感。

就李梓敬議員的提問，經諮詢勞工及福利局和民政事務總署，現回覆如下：

（一）房委會二○二○年至二○二四年接獲有關公屋管理事宜的投訴及尋求協助個案，按年載列於附件。

（二）至（六）房委會／房屋署一直積極擴闊與居民的溝通渠道，透過不同傳統和電子方式收集租戶的意見，以優化屋邨管理的服務。房屋署已在各屋邨大廈地下大堂設置意見箱，除提供意見調查的紙本問卷，亦在收集意見通告上印有二維碼和超連結，方便公屋住戶填寫電子問卷。經電子問卷收集的意見摘要，會透過每年五月和十一月出版的《屋邨通訊》向住戶發放，讓他們知悉其所屬屋邨的居民的關注事宜。

此外，房委會亦定期進行住戶意見調查收集居民對屋邨各服務承辦商（包括屋邨的物業服務公司、工程承辦商、潔淨及護衞服務承辦商）服務表現的意見。住戶可選擇填寫紙本問卷及意見書、回答電子問卷、進行電話會談或上門面談等方式表達意見。住戶亦可隨時致電或親臨各屋邨辦事處，或於職員進行家訪時與屋邨職員直接反映意見。

另外，房屋署每兩年會進行一次公營房屋住戶綜合統計調查，以蒐集現居於房委會轄下公屋住戶對房屋相關事宜的意見，當中包括屋邨管理、公用地方和住戶單位維修保養服務、屋邨管理扣分制、屋邨環保設施及工作，以及房委會商場設施和屋邨停車位安排。該統計調查涵蓋全港所有公共屋邨，以隨機抽樣方式抽選公屋單位住戶接受訪問，以收集公屋居民就上述事宜的意見。上述的調查結果會在房委會資助房屋小組委員會議公布，並讓公眾人士查閱。最新「公營房屋住戶統計調查」的主要結果可於房屋署網站下載（www.housingauthority.gov.hk/tc/common/pdf/about-us/housing-authority/ha-paper-library/SHC6-2024TC.pdf）。

為進一步推展創新科技在公共屋邨管理方面的應用，房委會會於今年內推出中央物業管理平台，透過數據分析及在日常管理引入數字科技，更有效地處理屋邨管理工作，提升服務水平。房委會亦已成立統籌專隊，協調各組別在屋邨管理的不同工作範疇試行各項創新科技及檢討管理模式，包括更新工作流程及工作手冊和向工作人員提供合適的訓練。我們會密切留意相關的技術發展，適時引進更多創新科技，以優化屋邨管理的工作。

在現有屋邨推行改善工程時，房委會非常重視居民的意見和參與。為使工程能夠真正符合居民的需求，房屋署採用了不同方式進行公眾諮詢，廣泛收集居民及持份者對改善工程的建議，以協助工程團隊能更有效制定詳細的設計方案。

深水埗澤安邨的改善工程更是其中一個創新的嘗試。房委會在二○二五年一月至五月期間舉辦了「幸福在澤安」設計比賽，邀請公眾為屋邨內的改善工程提供設計方案。比賽成功吸引了超過150位優秀的年青設計師和學生參與，他們透過創新和貼心的設計詮釋「幸福設計」指引的理念，為澤安邨的公共空間注入新活力。所有入圍團隊均通過居民參與及共創過程，收集澤安邨居民對設計的意見，得獎作品不僅展現了參賽者的專業和創意能力，更體現了他們對居民需求的細心關注和理解，讓居民以一個新的方式參與屋邨的改善工程，增加居民的歸屬感及自豪感。

房委會一直積極推動構建關愛共融社區，並會聯同非政府機構及其他政府部門，舉辦不同形式的社區建設活動，以促進鄰舍守望相助及加強社區的凝聚力。為進一步深化與地區持份者的交流，房屋署於本年第二季起，陸續在各管理分區舉辦屋邨管理分享會，邀請地區持份者包括當區區議員參與，以分享屋邨管理經驗。房屋署職員亦向他們簡介房委會最新通過的政策及相關資訊，以及直接聆聽他們有關屋邨管理的建議及意見。

為進一步加強對長者及殘疾人士的關注及支援及聆聽他們的意見，房委會轄下各公共屋邨辦事處積極協助地區服務及關愛隊伍（關愛隊）推展關愛活動，籌劃社區活動及為有需要的家庭（包括長者、殘疾人士和照顧者住戶），提供探訪及支援服務等。此外，房委會各屋邨每年均夥拍非政府機構舉辦活動包括外展探訪。勞工及福利局與房屋署已加強協作，透過整合社會福利署轄下安老服務使用者的資料及房屋署公屋住戶資料，識別高風險的隱蔽住戶，在二○二五年七月中於觀塘區及沙田區推出試點計劃，並邀請關愛隊主動接觸及探訪這些長者、殘疾人士和照顧者住戶，了解他們的需要及介紹相關的支援服務。計劃有助加強他們的支援網絡，便利他們在緊急或有需要時尋求協助，同時亦可聽取他們對其他服務及屋邨管理的意見。

房委會會繼續致力優化與公屋住戶溝通的機制及措施，提供多元便捷的溝通渠道，提升公屋管理水平，締造和諧社區及加強公屋居民的幸福感和歸屬感。"

LCQ21: Enhancing public rental housing management,2025-07-30 15:30,2025-07-30 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000341.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Dominic Lee and a written reply by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, who is undertaking the duties of the Secretary for Housing, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing,in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

  There are views that, in recent years, residents of public rental housing (PRH) have had differing opinions regarding the management services provided by the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA), however, the existing channels established by HA for collecting residents' opinions are not sufficiently comprehensive. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective total number of opinions submitted by PRH residents to HA through telephone hotlines, Estate Management Advisory Committees, mail, and other channels in each of the past five years, with a breakdown by the nature of the opinions submitted (e.g. PRH maintenance, environmental hygiene, and community facilities);

(2) whether the authorities have assessed the effectiveness of the existing opinion collection mechanism (e.g. the average time taken by HA to reply to opinions, the resolution rate of issues raised, and residents' satisfaction); if such an assessment has been conducted, of the specific indicators and results; if not, whether consideration will be given to establishing such an assessment mechanism;

(3) given that some elderly persons and persons with disabilities have reflected that the feedback channels established by HA are inadequate, whether HA will introduce feedback facilitation measures for specific individuals (e.g. door-to-door collection of opinions, simplified opinion collection forms, and the provision of voice input systems); if so, of the implementation timetable; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) whether the authorities have plans to develop an electronic platform to integrate opinion data related to PRH management across various districts, and to utilise artificial intelligence to analyse and identify issues of greatest public concern, as well as to predict potential problems in PRH management; if so, of the details and the estimated implementation timetable; if not, the reasons for that and the difficulties involved;

(5) whether it will, with reference to standards in private property management, require HA to regularly publish consolidated analysis reports on the opinions of PRH residents across the territory regarding PRH management, which should include trends in their primary demands and the follow-up improvement measures adopted by HA in response to such opinions; and

(6) whether it will consider organising regular engagement sessions to exchange views on housing estate management with local stakeholders (including District Council members, Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees, District Fire Safety Committees, District Services and Community Care Teams, owners' corporations and residents' representatives)?

Reply:

President,

  Always upholding the values of ""Caring"", the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has been committed to providing quality public rental housing (PRH) to residents. Through professional management and maintenance, we strive to create a good living environment for residents in an attentive and responsible manner. Residents of public housing are our major service targets. We attach great importance to their expectations and needs. We will continue to maintain contact with residents and local stakeholders, to collect their opinions through various channels, and to listen to their views on how to enhance the living quality of residents in public housing with a view to enhancing their sense of well-being.

  In response to the question raised by the Hon Dominic Lee, in consultation with the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) and the Home Affairs Department, our reply is as follows:

(1) The numbers of complaints and requests regarding estate management issues of PRH received by the HA from 2020 to 2024 are set out by year at Annex.

(2) to (6) The HA/Housing Department (HD) has been actively widening its communication channels with residents, and collecting opinions from PRH residents through both traditional and electronic means so as to enhance estate management services. The HD has placed suggestion boxes at the ground floor lobbies of domestic blocks in all estates. Apart from providing paper questionnaire surveys, the HD also printed QR code and hyperlinks to the electronic questionnaire survey on the notice for opinion collection to facilitate PRH residents to complete electronic questionnaires. Summaries of residents' opinions collected through electronic questionnaires will be distributed to residents through the Estate Newsletter published in May and November every year, so that they are informed of the concerns of other residents about the management issues in their respective estates.

  Furthermore, the HA/HD regularly conducts Tenants' Opinion Surveys to collect residents' feedback on the performance of various estate service contractors (including estate property service agents, works contractors, cleaning and security service contractors). Residents can choose to complete paper questionnaires and opinion forms, answer electronic questionnaires, have telephone interviews or face-to-face interviews to express their opinions. Residents are also welcome to exchange views with the HD's staff by making telephone calls or visiting estate management offices in person any time, or directly talk to estate staff during home visits to reflect their opinions.

  Additionally, the HD conducts the Public Housing Recurrent Survey (PHRS) biennially to collect views from households currently living in the HA's PRH estates on housing-related matters. The matters include estate management, maintenance services for estate common areas and households' premises, marking scheme for estate management enforcement, environmental facilities and initiatives in estates, as well as HA's shopping facilities and parking arrangement in estates. The survey covers all PRH estates in Hong Kong, with PRH households selected for participation in interviews through random sampling to collect the views of PRH residents on the abovementioned matters. The survey results are announced at the HA's Subsidised Housing Committee meetings and are made available for public's review. The major findings of the latest PHRS can be downloaded from the HD's website (www.housingauthority.gov.hk/en/common/pdf/about-us/housing-authority/ha-paper-library/SHC6-20241EN.pdf).

  To further promote the application of innovative technologies in PRH estate management, the HA will launch a centralised property management platform this year. By leveraging data analysis and integrating digital technology into daily management operations, the platform aims to enhance management efficiency and improve service quality. The HA has also established a dedicated co-ordination team to oversee the trial of various innovative technologies across different management areas and review operational models, including updating workflows and manuals as well as providing appropriate training to staff. We will closely monitor relevant technological developments and introduce more innovative technologies as appropriate to optimise estate management works.

  When implementing improvement works projects in existing estates, the HA places great emphasis on the views and participation of residents. To ensure that the works projects can truly meet the needs of the residents, the HD adopts various means for public consultation to extensively collect suggestions from residents and stakeholders on the improvement works projects. This helps the project team formulate detailed design proposals more effectively.

  The improvement works project at Chak On Estate in Sham Shui Po is one of the innovative attempts. The HA held the ""Let's Go Well-being Chak On"" Design Competition from January to May 2025 and invited the public to provide design proposals for the improvement works in the estate. The competition successfully attracted over 150 outstanding young designers and students to participate. They interpreted the concept of ""Well-being Design"" Guide through innovative and thoughtful designs, injecting new vitality into the communal spaces of Chak On Estate. All shortlisted teams engaged Chak On Estate residents in the co-creation processes and collected their views on the designs. Not only did the winning entries showcase the professionalism and creativity of the contestants, but they also reflected contestants' careful attention to and understanding of the residents' needs. This allowed residents to participate in the improvement works project of the estate in a novel way and enhanced their sense of belonging and pride.

  The HA has been actively promoting a caring and inclusive community and collaborates with non-governmental organisations and other government departments to organise various kinds of community building activities, strengthen mutual support among residents, and enhance community cohesion. To further deepen exchanges with local stakeholders, the HD has been organising regional estate management sharing sessions since the second quarter of this year. Local stakeholders including relevant District Council members were invited to participate in the sessions to exchange views and share their estate management experience. The HD staff also briefed the participants on the latest policies of the HA and related information, and directly listened to their suggestions and opinions on estate management.

  To further strengthen the attention and support for the elderly and the disabled, as well as to listen to their opinions, the PRH estate offices under the HA proactively assist the District Services and Community Care Teams (Care Teams) in promoting care activities, organising community events, and offering visits and support services for families in need (including elderly households, disabled individual, and carer households). Additionally, the HA partners with non-governmental organisations to host activities such as outreach visits every year. The LWB and the HD have strengthened their collaboration by integrating data from the Social Welfare Department's elderly service users with the HD's PRH residents' data so as to identify high-risk hidden households. In mid-July 2025, a pilot scheme was launched in Kwun Tong District and Sha Tin District, inviting the Care Teams to proactively contact and visit these elderly, disabled individual and carer households to understand their needs and introduce relevant support services, etc. This scheme enables them to strengthen their support networks, to seek assistance in emergencies or when needed, and to be heard of their views on other services and estate management.

  The HA will continuously strive to optimise the communication mechanism and measures with PRH residents, provide diverse and convenient communication channels, so as to enhance public housing management standards, build a harmonious community and strengthen the sense of well-being and belonging of PRH residents."
Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-07-30 15:30,2025-07-30 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000561.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on July 29 to noon today (July 30), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 204 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 154 635 samples of food imported from Japan (including 101 387 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 35 096 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."
IOMed headquarters building project completed (with photos/video),2025-07-30 15:00,2025-07-30 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000420.htm,"  With the renovation project for the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) headquarters building completed, the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, and the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Cui Jianchun, visited the headquarters building today (July 30), signifying that the building is fully equipped and ready to serve as the IOMed headquarters and for other related purposes in the future.

  Accompanied by the Director-General of the IOMed Preparatory Office, Dr Sun Jin, and the Permanent Secretary for Development (Works), Mr Ricky Lau, Mr Lam and Mr Cui toured various areas including the main lobby, conference rooms, mediation rooms and exhibition areas of the headquarters. They were briefed by the Director of Architectural Services, Mr Michael Li, on the revitalisation process and facilities of the building.

  The IOMed headquarters building was converted from the Old Wan Chai Police Station, a Grade-2 historic building. The design principle of the conversion was to complement the image and functionality of the IOMed headquarters by preserving the original architectural features of the old police station while adopting minimal and reversible alterations. As the first international intergovernmental legal organisation dedicated to the use of mediation in resolving international disputes, the IOMed headquarters is located in a landmark architectural building in the central business district of Hong Kong. This not only accentuates the special international status of the IOMed and accommodates its operational needs, but also fosters the conservation and revitalisation of the Old Wan Chai Police Station, reflecting the emphasis and determination of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government in preserving and revitalising historical buildings.

  With the proactive efforts of the HKSAR Government and co-operation from various parties, the headquarters building project was completed quickly and efficiently in about a year and a half, fulfilling the target set out in the supplement of last year's Policy Address, which aimed for the substantial completion of the headquarters building in mid-2025 to enable the offi­cial establishment of the IOMed headquarters in Hong Kong after the entry into force of the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation. Following the completion of the project, the headquarters building will be officially handed over to the IOMed Preparatory Office on August 1 to make good preparation use for the establishment and opening of the IOMed. The Department of Justice will fully support the IOMed's future work and is confident that, by leveraging synergy with various relevant regional or international organisations within Hong Kong's legal hub, it will help consolidate Hong Kong's positioning as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region under the National 14th Five-Year Plan, and contribute to the developmentof foreign-related rule of law of the country and the promotion of national strategies such as the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative."

The Department of Justice will fully support the IOMed's future work and is confident that, by leveraging synergy with various relevant regional or international organisations within Hong Kong's legal hub, it will help consolidate Hong Kong's positioning as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region under the National 14th Five-Year Plan, and contribute to the developmentof foreign-related rule of law of the country and the promotion of national strategies such as the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative."
立法會十八題：打擊從事駕駛及送貨工作的非法勞工,2025-07-30 14:52,2025-07-30 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000314.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上黎棟國議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

據報有持《往來港澳通行證》（俗稱雙程證）人士以旅客身份，在港駕駛非法載客取酬服務車輛（俗稱白牌車）。有意見認為，現時運輸署容許持有有效旅行證件的人士申請免試簽發香港正式駕駛執照（免試簽發駕駛執照），或會助長持雙程證人士甚至持有俗稱「行街紙」的免遣返聲請人士在港非法從事駕車載客或食物外送員等取酬工作。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年每年非香港居民申請免試簽發駕駛執照的數目，並按申請人所持證件／文（即外國護照、雙程證及行街紙）列出分項數字；

（二）過去五年每年政府處理的非法勞工案件數目；當中有多少宗涉及駕車載客或食物外送員工作的案件，以及涉案人士的居留身份分別為何；及

（三）會否考慮修改免試簽發駕駛執照政策，以堵塞持有有效旅行證件的訪客或行街紙人士可免試獲發駕駛執照後非法從事駕駛及送貨工作等的漏洞？

答覆：

主席：

根據《道路交通條例》（第374章）第52（3）條，任何人不得駕駛或使用汽車，或容受或允許他人駕駛或使用汽車，以作出租或取酬載客用途，除非該車輛領有生效的出租汽車許可證。政府一向十分關注任何人利用汽車作非法出租或取酬載客的情況，並一直採取針對性執法行動，以打擊非法出租或取酬載客活動。

就「免試簽發香港正式駕駛執照」（「免試簽發」）方面，運輸署是按照《道路交通（駕駛執照）規例》（第374B章）（《規例》）第11（3）條的規定處理申請，讓持有由《規例》附表4的32國家和地方（下稱「認可國家或地方」）所簽發的駕駛執照的人士，在符合指定條件下，可無須通過本地駕駛考試而獲直接簽發香港正式駕駛執照，以駕駛四種車輛類別：私家車、輕型貨車、電單車及機動三輪車。

在申請「免試簽發」時，有關認可國家或地方所簽發的駕駛執照必須屬仍然有效或有效期屆滿不超過三年，以及是申請人在簽發國家或地方經成功完成有關的駕駛考試後而獲得的。此外，申請人必須年滿十八歲，並符合以下其中一項條件：（1）持有的駕駛執照是申請人在簽發國家或地方居住不少過六個月的期間發出；或（2）在緊接申請前申請人已持有該認可國家或地方的駕駛執照不少於五年；或（3）申請人持有該駕駛執照簽發國家或地方的護照或同等的旅行證件。

就黎議員提問的各部分，經諮詢保安局和運輸署後，現回覆如下：

（一）根據《規例》第10條，「免試簽發」申請人如不是香港居民身份證持有人，須提交屬《入境條例》（第115章）第2(1)條所界定的有效旅行證件（例如護照或同等的有效旅行證件）作為其身分證明文件。運輸署並不接納任何人以入境事務處（入境處）發出的「表格8」擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）作為提交駕駛執照申請的有效身分證明文件。如運輸署對申請人提交的證明文件有懷疑，會向相關機構查證及確認。

根據運輸署的紀錄，過去五年，按持護照、往來港澳通行證（俗稱「雙程證」）等非香港身份證的身分證明文件類別劃分，「免試簽發」的獲批申請宗數表列如下：

（三）互認駕駛資格和容讓免試簽發駕駛執照是不少國家或地方的慣常做法，而「免試簽發」亦在香港實施多年，以便利來自不同地方的市民按當地的申請條件換領相關車輛種類的駕駛執照，省卻重新考核以領取當地駕駛執照的資源和時間。如上文所述，運輸署不接納以「行街紙」作為申請「免試簽發」的有效身分證明文件。至於符合前文提及的條件的護照或同等旅行證件持有人，則可以申請「免試簽發」。事實上，持有有效香港駕駛執照和港澳居民來往內地通行證的香港居民，亦可以在廣東省免試換領內地駕照。

運輸署會繼續就駕駛執照相關事宜與有關決策局和部門合作，包括把懷疑非法載客取酬的個案轉交相關執法部門跟進，並全力配合有關的調查工作。"
LCQ18: Crack down on illegal workers engaged in driving and delivery work,2025-07-30 14:52,2025-07-30 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000383.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Lai Tung-kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

It has been reported that some individuals holding Exit-entry Permits for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao (commonly known as Two-way Exit Permits) have been driving vehicles in Hong Kong as tourists for illegal carriage of passengers for reward (commonly known as white licence cars). There are views that the Transport Department's current practice of allowing individuals with valid travel documents to apply for direct issue of full Hong Kong Driving Licences without test (direct issue of HKDLs) may encourage Two-way Exit Permit holders, or even non-refoulement claimants holding (commonly known as going-out passes), to illegally engage in work such as driving for carriage of passengers or food delivery in Hong Kong for reward. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of non-Hong Kong residents who applied for direct issue of HKDLs in each of the past five years, with a breakdown by the type of documents/papers held by the applicants (i.e. foreign passports, Two-way Exit Permits and going-out passes);

(2) of the number of illegal worker cases handled by the Government in each of the past five years; among such cases, the number of those involving driving for carriage of passengers or food delivery, and the immigration status of individuals involved in these cases; and

(3) whether it will consider revising the policy of direct issue of HKDLs in order to plug the loophole that allows visitors holding valid travel documents or individuals with going-out passes to obtain direct issue of HKDLs and subsequently illegally engage in work such as driving and delivery?

Reply:

President,

According to section 52(3) of the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374), no person shall drive or use a motor vehicle, or suffer or permit a motor vehicle to be driven or used, for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward unless a hire car permit (HCP) is in force in respect of the vehicle. The Government has all along been very concerned about the use of motor vehicles by any person for illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward, and has been taking targeted enforcement actions to combat illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward activities.

Regarding direct issue of a Hong Kong full driving licence without test (direct issue), the Transport Department handles direct issue applications in accordance with regulation 11(3) of the Road Traffic (Driving Licences) Regulations (Cap. 374B) (the Regulations), which allows a person holding a driving licence issued by one of the 32 countries and places specified in the Fourth Schedule to the Regulations (recognised countries or places), and provided that specified conditions are met, to be directly issued with a Hong Kong full driving licence without taking a local driving test for driving four classes of vehicles: private cars, light goods vehicles, motor cycles and motor tricycles.

To apply for direct issue, the driving licence issued by the relevant recognised country or place must still be valid or expired for not more than three years, and be obtained by the applicant after successful completion of a driving test conducted in the issuing country or place. Also, the applicant must be aged 18 years or above and meet one of the following requirements: (1) the driving licence held was issued during a period of the applicant's residence of not less than six months in the issuing country or place; or (2) the applicant has been holding the driving licence issued by the recognised country or place for not less than five years immediately prior to the application; or (3) the applicant is the holder of a passport or other equivalent travel document issued in the country or place in which the driving licence was issued.

In consultation with the Security Bureau and the Transport Department (TD), our reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Lai Tung-kwok is as follows:

(1) According to regulation 10 of the Regulations, an applicant for direct issue who is not a holder of Hong Kong identity card shall submit a valid travel document as defined in section 2(1) of the Immigration Ordinance (Cap. 115) (for example, a passport or equivalent valid travel document) as his/her identity document. The TD does not accept any person on recognisance holding form no. 8 issued by the Immigration Department (ImmD) as a valid identity document for submitting a driving licence application. If the TD has doubts about the supporting documents submitted by the applicant, it will verify and confirm with the relevant agencies.

According to TD's record, over the past five years, the number of direct issue applications approved by the types of identity documents other than Hong Kong identity card including passports, Exit/Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao (commonly known as Two-way Permits) etc., are tabulated below:

Note 1: Other identity documents include the Consular Corps Identity Card.

(2) The Government is committed to combatting illegal employment, with a view to protecting job opportunities for the local workforce. It is a serious offence to engage in illegal employment. Employers, illegal workers as well as aiders and abettors of illegal employment will be liable to prosecution in accordance with the Immigration Ordinance (Cap. 115). Illegal immigrants and non-refoulement claimants, etc., who take any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establish or join in any business, are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. Besides, any person who takes up any employment, whether paid or unpaid, in contravention of a condition of stay, shall be guilty of an offence. Upon conviction, he/she is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment.

According to ImmD's record, the number of illegal workers prosecuted over the past five years is tabulated below:

(3) Mutual recognition of driving qualifications and the issuance of driving licences without test are common practices in many countries or places, and direct issue has also been implemented in Hong Kong for many years, with a view to facilitating citizens in different places to obtain driving licences for relevant vehicle classes in accordance with local application criteria, saving the resources and time of taking assessments and obtaining local driving licences afresh. As mentioned above, the TD does not accept a recognisance form as a valid identity document for applying for direct issue. For holders of passports or equivalent travel documents that meet the conditions mentioned above, they can apply for direct issue. In fact, Hong Kong residents holding a valid Hong Kong driving licence and a Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents can also obtain a Mainland driving licence without test in Guangdong Province.

The TD will continue to collaborate with relevant policy bureaux and departments on driving licence-related matters, including referring any suspected cases of illegal carriage of passengers for reward to relevant law enforcement agencies for follow-up, fully co-operating with relevant investigations."

立法會十六題：推動性別主流化,2025-07-30 14:45,2025-07-30 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000293.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上陳家珮議員的提問和民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟的書面答覆︰

問題：

政府自二○○二年起在政策和工作範疇逐步推行「性別主流化」，以在設計、實施、監察和評估法例、政策和計劃時，把男性及女性的觀點和需要作為其中一項主要的考慮因素，確保兩性可以同等享有及受惠於社會的資源和機會。然而，有意見認為現時多項與性別主流化相關的參考文件及刊物（例如《性別主流化手冊》與相關單張，以及供政府人員使用的性別主流化檢視清單等）已超過10年未作更新，其內容未必能跟上時代的發展。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年各政策局及政府部門推行性別主流化的實例詳情為何；

（二）是否知悉婦女事務委員會未來就向各行業及公眾推廣性別主流化的計劃詳情為何；及

（三）有否計劃更新性別主流化相關的參考文件及刊物；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就陳家珮議員的提問，現回覆如下：

性別主流化是一項由聯合國提倡促進婦女權益及兩性平等的全球性策略，目標旨在促使決策者在處理日常事務及制訂政策時，把兩性的需要和觀點列為決策過程中必須考慮的因素，從而保障兩性可以公平合理地獲取和享有社會的資源和機會。

政府十分重視透過建立具性別敏感度的決策過程，於政府內推廣性別主流化，並透過在制訂政策的過程中有系統地納入不同性別的觀點及需要，有效地落實性別主流化。為了協助政府人員推行性別主流化，婦女事務委員會（婦委會）編製了性別主流化檢視清單（檢視清單），利用一系列問題，協助政府部門更有系統地在制訂政策及措施時考慮性別主流化。自二○一五年四月一日起，政府所有決策局及部門在制訂主要政府政策及措施時須參考檢視清單，應用性別主流化。政府至今檢視超過1800份政策文件，而相關政策和措施在推出前亦已參考檢視清單應用性別主流化，致力確保女性的需要被納入考慮當中。這些措施的範圍十分廣泛，涉及不同的政策範疇及設施設計等。

政府亦致力增強公職人員對性別課題和性別主流化的認識。為此，政府定期向不同職系及職級的人員提供培訓，二○○一年起至今，已有超過17000名人員接受相關培訓。民政及青年事務局（民青局）亦製作了有關的網上課程，供政府人員參考。

政府和婦委會亦一直緊密合作，透過不同途徑，向社會各界別推廣性別主流化的概念。民青局與婦委會每年舉辦國際婦女節酒會，提升公眾對婦女共同關注的課題的認識。酒會設有展板介紹包括性別主流化等的概念。另外，婦委會自二○二二年九月起為幼稚園和初小學生舉辦到校講座，旨在提升學生的性別意識，包括向學生介紹聯合國《消除對婦女一切形式歧視公約》、提倡有關男女平等，以及避免性別定型等關鍵信息，並教導學生在日常生活中實踐這些理念。至今婦委會已舉辦150場到校講座。

此外，民青局和婦委會已經正式推出「『友』妳啟導」友師計劃，為有志投身專業行業或商界的本港女大學生配對女性領袖友師，並提供相關培訓及活動。我們亦會藉此機會加入與性別課題相關的培訓，讓更多年輕人認識性別主流化的概念。民青局和婦委會日後亦會善用不同平台，包括與女性領袖午餐會、家庭暨婦女發展高峰會等，進一步向社會各界推廣性別主流化。

性別主流化作為聯合國為促進婦女權益及兩性平等而推行的重要策略，政府會不時檢視現有與性別主流化相關參考文件和工具，並按需要調整內容，以確保其適用性。我們亦會持續推出與性別主流化相關的文章或資料，通過不同途徑向公眾推廣性別主流化，例如我們已經於二○二四年十月推出的一站式家庭及婦女資訊平台，上載與性別主流化有關的文章。政府將繼續與婦委會攜手合作，通過三管齊下的策略，即提供有利的環境、增強婦女能力和推行公眾教育，以促進婦女的福祉及權益。"
LCQ16: Promoting gender mainstreaming,2025-07-30 14:45,2025-07-30 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000296.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Judy Chan and a written reply by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

Since 2002, the Government has progressively implemented ""gender mainstreaming"" in its policy and programme areas, taking into account the perspectives and needs of both genders as one of the key considerations in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of legislation, policies and programmes. This ensures that both genders have equitable access to, and benefit from, society's resources and opportunities. However, there are views that a number of existing reference documents and publications relating to gender mainstreaming (e.g. the Gender Mainstreaming Guidebook and related leaflets, as well as the Gender Mainstreaming Checklist for Government staff) have not been updated for more than 10 years, and their contents may no longer keep pace with current developments. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the details of the actual examples of gender mainstreaming implemented by various policy bureaux and government departments in the past three years;

(2) whether it knows the details of the future plans of the Women's Commission to promote gender mainstreaming in various trades and industries and among the public; and

(3) whether it has plans to update the reference documents and publications relating to gender mainstreaming; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The reply to the question raised by the Hon Judy Chan is as follows:

Gender mainstreaming is a global strategy advocated by the United Nations for the promotion of women's advancement and gender equality. It aims to ensure that the needs and perspectives of women and men are considered when conducting day-to-day work and making policies, so as to ensure that women and men have equitable access to, and benefit from, society's resources and opportunities.

The Government attaches great importance in promoting gender mainstreaming within the Government by establishing a gender-sensitive decision-making process and systematically integrating gender perspectives and needs into the policy formulation process to fully implement gender mainstreaming. To assist government staff to implement gender mainstreaming, the Women's Commission (WoC) developed a Gender Mainstreaming Checklist (the Checklist), which assisted government departments to adopt gender mainstreaming in a more systematic manner by answering a series of questions. Since April 1, 2015, all Government bureaux and departments shall refer to the Checklist and apply gender mainstreaming when formulating major government policies and initiatives. To date, the Government has reviewed over 1800 policy papers, and relevant policies and initiatives have incorporated gender mainstreaming with reference to the Checklist prior to implementation, striving to ensure that the needs of women are taken into consideration. These initiatives are broad in scope, covering different policy areas and facility designs.

The Government is also committed to enhancing public servants' understanding of gender-related issues and gender mainstreaming. To this end, the Government provides training for officers of different grades and ranks regularly. Since 2001, over 17000 officers have received relevant training. The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) also developed related e-learning courses for government officers' reference.

The Government and the WoC have also been working closely to promote the concept of gender mainstreaming to all sectors of society through various channels. The HYAB and the WoC organise the International Women's Day Reception every year to raise public awareness on various issues of common concern to women. The reception featured exhibition panels that introduced concepts including gender mainstreaming. Additionally, since September 2022, the WoC has been organising school talks for kindergarten and lower primary students to raise their gender awareness by introducing to students the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, promoting gender equality and challenging gender stereotype. Students are also taught on applying these concepts in daily lives. The WoC has organised 150 school talks so far.

Furthermore, the HYAB and the WoC have officially launched the ""She Inspires"" Mentorship Programme, which matches local female university students who aspire to pursue a career in the professional or business sectors with women leader mentors, and provides relevant training and activities. We will also take this opportunity to include gender-related training to let more young people understand the concept of gender mainstreaming. The HYAB and the WoC will also make good use of different platforms, including the luncheon with women leaders and the Family and Women Development Summit, to further promote gender mainstreaming to all sectors of society.

Gender mainstreaming is the United Nations' key strategy to promote women's interest and to achieve gender equality. The Government will review existing reference documents and tools related to gender mainstreaming from time to time and adjust their contents as necessary to ensure their applicability. We will also continue to publish articles or information related to gender mainstreaming and promote gender mainstreaming to the public through various channels, such as uploading articles related to gender mainstreaming to the one-stop family and women information portal launched in October 2024. The Government will continue to work hand in hand with the WoC to promote the well-being and interests of women through a three-pronged strategy, namely the provision of an enabling environment, empowerment of women through capacity building and public education."

今次立法建議旨在作出技術性修訂，更新載列於現行《輻射（管制輻照儀器）規例》（第303B章）中眼睛晶狀體的職業劑量限值，以配合國際放射防護委員會International Commission on Radiological Protection，簡稱ICRP所建議的最新國際標準。這個限值是由香港輻射管理局為本地擔任輻射工作的人士所訂定的安全標準，將可更好預防從業員患上輻射引致的白內障。

ICRP是一個獨立運作的非牟利國際組織，目標是推動輻射防護科研以保障公眾福祉，其建議一向獲全球各地廣泛採納。其中，ICRP於二○一一年審視最新科學證據後，建議收緊眼睛晶狀體的職業劑量限值，由每年150毫希沃特，修改為於五年內平均每年20毫希沃特，並且在任何一年內不超過50毫希沃特。自此，這個新標準已獲多個國家／地區和國際組織陸續採用。

在香港，輻射管理局於二○一七年委託衞生署進行調查，初步顯示本地從業員普遍可遵守ICRP的新標準，並因此再委託衞生署於二○二○年諮詢持份者，包括香港醫學專科學院、公立醫院、私家醫院及放射性藥物供應商等。所有回應者均對收緊第303B章中眼睛晶狀體的職業劑量限值表示同意或不持異議。

經考慮業界回應後，輻射管理局在二○二○年十二月建議政府修例。政府亦同步籌備配套工作，確保香港業界能夠符合新標準。縱使工作進度受早前新冠疫情影響，衞生署已於二○二五年三月起為本地從業員推出眼睛晶狀體職業輻射劑量的監察服務，有助實施經修訂後的規例。輻射管理局亦於二○二五年六月十六日正式通過第303B章的修訂建議，由政府現時向立法會提交草案，以供考慮。

主席，我謹此陳辭，提出上述動議。"
立法會四題：規管電動可移動工具的使用及銷售,2025-07-30 14:30,2025-07-30 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000426.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上劉國勳議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

政府近年多番表示計劃立法規管電動可移動工具。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）上述立法工作的詳情和最新進展為何，以及預計有關法例何時生效；鑑於根據政府資料，過去五年涉及電動可移動工具交通意外的被捕人數不斷上升，政府會否在相關條例草案中提高該等交通意外的罰則，以加強阻嚇力；

（二）鑑於現行法例下，售賣電動可移動工具並不違法，但有意見認為該等產品的電池質量存疑，發生意外風險高，政府有否計劃規管售賣該等產品的網上和實體商店，以確保其售賣的產品符合擬議的技術和安全要求；如有，計劃詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）據報目前電動可移動工具使用者遍布各區，不少外賣員及長者均以其作日常代步工具，政府會否在平衡安全、技術標準、執法可行性及使用情況等因素後，除開放單車徑外，提供更多可供電動可移動工具行走的範圍和路段，以令有關規管安排更切合實際情況？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直以來對推動綠色出行的新科技秉持開放態度，同時非常重視道路安全。電動可移動工具是由機械驅動，符合《道路交通條例》（第374章）中「汽車」的定義，因此現時必須領牌才可於道路或私家路上行駛。我們留意到電動可移動工具在世界各地日趨普及，但香港人口密集，人流量高、車流量大，有需要適當規管電動可移動工具的使用，才可用作有效且安全的短途出行選項。

就劉國勳議員提問的各部分，經諮詢運輸署，現綜合回覆如下：

電動可移動工具主要包括兩類：（一）電動個人移動工具，例如電動滑板車、電動單輪車（俗稱「風火輪」）及電動平衡車等；及（二）電動輔助單車。政府正積極研究循以下幾個方向規管電動可移動工具。

首先，使用地點方面，電動可移動工具可作為短途出行和首／尾程接駁鐵路站和車站等的代步工具，讓市民有更多主動出行方式選擇。運輸署已經積極與相關部門商討，在新發展區例如洪水橋新發展區，建設全面的單車徑網絡，亦會在其他地區選取合適的單車徑，容納單車及電動可移動工具同時安全行駛，除非該些單車徑個別而言不符合特定的要求，例如闊度不足、與行人路或行車道交替頻繁等。至於電動輔助單車，基於它們的操作模式近似單車，我們計劃容許它們在所有單車徑上使用。

此外，因應電動可移動工具的設計和相關營運模式等亦有變化，運輸署於二○二三至二四年在白石角進行共享電動輔助單車試驗計劃。該計劃運作大致順暢，並顯示共享模式需要適當配套如充電池設施及充電頻率等，供政府在規劃電動可移動工具可使用路段時作參考。

至於能否開放單車徑以外的地點，政府理解市民對於電動可移動工具的接受程度不盡相同。在過去的調查中，有六成多受訪者支持在單車徑上使用經妥善規管的電動可移動工具，其餘三成則持保留意見，關注其潛在風險和現有單車徑的空間有限。政府會小心考慮不同意見，以確保道路安全。

第二，產品規管方面，為確保產品安全，運輸署正就電動可移動工具制訂技術和安全要求，並計劃要求由獲第三方機構認可的認證機構測試各產品的技術規格及電機要求。電動可移動工具的生產商或代理須向認證機構申請認證，獲認證的產品會貼上二維碼認證標籤，方便市民及執法人員辨識。至於問題中提到的電池及電子設備，我們認為有需要根據國際標準進行認證測試，例如過度充電或放電控制、短路及過熱防禦、振動和機械衝擊測試等，以確保產品安全。

為確保產品認證在香港市場切實可行，運輸署早前已諮詢業界，業界一般認為安排合理。運輸署正物色具備條件的認證機構，並聯同香港生產力促進局合作草擬產品認證安排的細節，亦會繼續仔細考慮不同持份者的角色和責任，以規管產品安全，讓市民可安心選購和適當使用。

第三，使用者方面，建議使用者必須年滿16歲及須佩戴頭盔。政府已成立包括業界代表和政府部門的工作小組，制訂《實務守則》，訂明電動可移動工具的技術細節、操作規則、安全提示及指引等。運輸署會繼續進行宣傳和教育的工作，灌輸正確的駕駛態度，讓市民安全及負責任地使用。

第四，罰則方面，我們認為罰則應與其使用風險相稱。與騎單車相似的違規行為如魯莽駕駛，可參考與單車相關的罰則，至於若干較嚴重的罪行如非法改裝，可參考與汽車相關的罰則。

因應上述四方面，政府正同時進行有關的法律草擬工作，糅合實際經驗以確保立法建議切實可行。由於議題涉及範圍廣泛，我們計劃於短期內向立法會交通事務委員會報告進展，並爭取在明年將修訂《道路交通條例》的條例草案以及新的附屬法例提交立法會審議。

多謝主席。"
LCQ4: Regulating use and sale of electric mobility devices,2025-07-30 14:30,2025-07-30 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000432.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Lau Kwok-fan and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

In recent years, the Government has repeatedly indicated its plan to enact legislation to regulate electric mobility devices (EMDs). In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the details and latest progress of the aforesaid legislative exercise, and the expected timeline for the relevant legislation to come into effect; given that according to government information, the number of persons arrested in traffic accidents involving EMDs had been continuously increasing in the past five years, whether the Government will impose in the relevant bill heavier penalties on non-compliance involving such traffic accidents, with a view to enhancing the deterrent effect;

(2) given that while the sale of EMDs is not an illegal activity under the existing legislation, there are views that the quality of the batteries of such products is questionable and the risk of accidents is high, whether the Government has plans to regulate the online and physical stores selling such products, so as to ensure that the products on sale comply with the proposed technical and safety requirements; if so, of the details of the plans; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as it has been reported that at present, EMDs are widely used in different districts, and quite a number of takeaway food couriers and elderly people use EMDs as a mode of everyday transport, whether the Government will, upon striking a balance among factors such as safety, technical standards, feasibility of law enforcement and situation of usage, provide more areas and road sections for the use of EMDs, in addition to opening up cycle tracks, so as to ensure the relevant regulatory arrangements to better align with the practical circumstances?

Reply:

President,

The Government has always adopted an open attitude towards new technologies for promoting green commuting, whilst attaching great importance to road safety. As electric mobility devices (EMDs) are mechanically propelled, they fall within the definition of ""motor vehicles"" under the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374) (the Ordinance) and must be licensed before use on roads or private roads. We note that EMDs are becoming increasingly popular around the world. However, given the dense population and high passenger and vehicular flow in Hong Kong, we consider that EMDs should be properly regulated before they can be used to provide effective and safe short-distance commuting options.

In consultation with the Transport Department (TD), my comprehensive reply to the different parts of the question raised by the Hon Lau Kwok-fan is as follows:

EMDs mainly include two categories: (a) motorised personal mobility devices such as electric scooters, electric unicycles and electric hoverboards; and (b) power assisted pedal cycles (PAPCs). The Government is actively looking into the regulation of EMDs along the following directions.

Firstly, regarding the locations for use, EMDs can serve as commuting means for short-distance travel and first-mile/last-mile connectivity to and from railway stations and stations, etc, providing the general public with more options of active transport modes. The TD has been proactively discussing with relevant departments the construction of comprehensive cycle track networks in new development areas such as the Hung Shui Kiu New Development Area, and will select suitable cycle tracks in other areas that can accommodate the safe co-use of bicycles and EMDs, except on individual basis, those cycle tracks which do not fulfil the particular requirements (e.g. insufficient width or frequent crossings with pedestrian footpath and vehicular roads). As for power assisted pedal cycles, we propose allowing them to be used on all cycle tracks since their operating mode is similar to that of bicycles.

Furthermore, given the ongoing changes in the design and operating mode of EMDs, the TD carried out a trial scheme on the shared use of power assisted pedal cycles in Pak Shek Kok from 2023 to 2024. The implementation of the trial scheme was smooth in general and the results indicate that suitable ancillary facilities (e.g. charging facilities and frequency of charging) will be needed for the operation of the shared mode. The Government will make reference to such experience when planning for the road sections for use of EMDs.

With regard to whether it is possible to open locations other than cycle tracks, the Government understands that public acceptance of EMDs varies. In previous surveys, over 60 per cent of the respondents supported the use of properly regulated EMDs on cycle tracks, while the remaining 30-odd per cent of the respondents expressed reservation, with the main concerns being the potential risks of EMDs as well as the limited space of existing cycle tracks. The Government will carefully consider the differing views to ensure road safety.

Secondly, regarding product regulation, to ensure product safety, the TD is formulating technical and safety requirements for EMDs, and plans to require third-party accredited certification bodies to test the technical specifications as well as the electrical and mechanical requirements of the various products. Manufacturers or agents of EMDs will be required to apply to the certification bodies for certification of products, and certified products will be affixed with a QR code certification label for easy identification by the public and enforcement officers. With regard to the batteries and electronic devices mentioned in the question, we consider that it is necessary for them to be certified according to international standards, e.g. over-charging or discharging control, short-circuit and overheating protection, vibration and mechanical shock tests, to ensure product safety.

To ensure that the product certification is practical in the Hong Kong market, the TD has been consulting the trade, who generally finds the proposed arrangements reasonable. The TD is identifying certification bodies that possess the relevant capabilities and is working in collaboration with the Hong Kong Productivity Council to formulate the details of the relevant certification arrangements, and will continue to give careful consideration to the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders with a view to regulating product safety, so that members of the public can feel confident when purchasing EMDs and use them properly.

Thirdly, regarding users, EMDs users must be at least 16 years old and wear a helmet. The Government has set up a working group, comprising representatives from the trade and Government departments, to formulate a code of practice to set out the technical details, operating rules, as well as safety advice and guidelines etc, regarding EMDs. The TD will continue its work on publicity and education, instilling into EMD users proper driving attitude to ensure the safe and responsible use of EMDs.

Fourthly, regarding the issue of penalties, we consider that the penalties should be proportionate to the risks of using EMDs. For violations similar to those of cycling such as reckless driving, reference can be made to the penalties related to cycling. As for certain more serious offences such as illegal modifications, reference can be made to the penalties related to motor vehicles.

Considering the aforementioned four aspects, the Government is undertaking the relevant law drafting work, and will take into consideration the actual experience to ensure the practicality of the proposal. As the topic has a wide coverage, we plan to report the progress to the Legislative Council Panel on Transport shortly, with the aim of introducing the Bill for amending the Ordinance and the new subsidiary legislation into the Legislative Council for scrutiny next year.

Thank you, President."

​立法會：運輸及物流局局長根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》及《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》動議的兩項擬議決議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 14:26,2025-07-30 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000501.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》及《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》動議的兩項擬議決議案的開場發言：

主席：

我謹動議通過印載於議程內，以我名義提出的第一項決議案，上調《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》訂明有關違例泊車的定額罰款。我將稍後動議通過印載於議程內我的第二項決議案，上調《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》附表內與道路安全和交通擠塞有關的其中19項罪行的定額罰款。

違例泊車和大部分交通違例事項的定額罰款自一九九四年，即31年以來維持不變，而同期的消費物價指數已上升超過70%，罰款的阻嚇力或有所抵銷。縱使警務處一直按照重點交通執法項目切實執法，打擊各類型的交通罪行，保障交通安全與道路暢通，部分交通罪行，例如超速駕駛、沒有遵從道路標記、橫過連續雙白線、駕駛時使用流動電話等的執法數字，仍有上升或居高不下的趨勢，反映現行的罰款額已不足以發揮應有的阻嚇力。交通意外數字方面，在今年第一季的交通意外中，致命交通意外宗數和死亡人數均比去年同期大幅上升四成。此外，駕駛者在路旁違泊可能引致交通擠塞，甚至阻礙行人視線而影響道路安全。警務處因違例泊車而發出定額罰款通知書的數字持續高企，交通諮詢委員會在二○二五年第一季收到違泊的投訴有370宗，較去年同期增加了10%，可見市民都希望盡快改善違泊的問題。

事實上，香港的交通違例事項定額罰款水平遠較多個海外地區為低，以違例泊車為例，新加坡、倫敦和澳洲新南威爾斯州的罰款水平，折換成港元計算，最高達香港水平的10倍。至於超速駕駛，上述地區的罰款水平，最高更達香港水平的22倍。

為了恢復定額罰款應有的阻嚇力，保障交通安全和交通暢順，政府認為實有必要提高香港法例第237章內違例泊車罪行及第240章內19項有關道路安全和導致交通擠塞的罪行的罰款額。我們在今年四月就調整罰款額的建議諮詢立法會交通事務委員會。委員普遍認同調整的需要。

就違例泊車罰款的調整，有議員在交通事務委員會的討論上，建議政府增加泊車位供應及在對違例泊車執法時酌情處理。就增加泊車位供應，政府非常認同，亦一直致力增加泊車位，過往幾年積極推展一系列短、中、長期措施，在香港有限的空間、狹窄車多的道路，努力在每區盡量劃設泊車位，過程中顧及地區意見。在過去三年，全港已新增超過15 000個泊車位，當中有三分之一是商用車位，私家車的泊車位與領牌車輛數目的比例上升至1.14。而未來兩年，政府預計可再增加超過12 000個泊車位，當中包括700個商用車位，加上私人發展項目和短期租約停車場的泊車位，我們會積極工作，努力推進，令本港泊車位供應持續大為改善。

在商用車輛方面，現時泊車位與領牌車輛數目的比例為0.66。我們未來會繼續多管齊下增加商用車泊車位，重點措施包括積極加大力度增加路旁夜間泊車位、放寬禁區供貨車上落貨或方便小巴上落客、將部分的士站劃作的士停泊處、與房屋署繼續密切安排將現有合適的資助房屋範圍內的上落客貨處在夜間也開放給商用車停泊等。至於執法方面，警務處進行交通執法時，主要考慮是確保道路安全，以及維持道路暢順。警務人員會視乎現場實際環境靈活判斷，或會就個別情況作酌情處理，但如違泊情況影響道路安全，警務處會果斷採取執法行動。事實上，警務處就違例泊車發出的定額罰款通知書，由二○二二年的330萬張下降至二○二四年的250萬張，降幅約25%。

我們非常明白部分議員對運輸業界泊車情況的關注，然而我希望讓社會及各位議員理解，無論是商用車或私家車，違例停泊都會影響行人及其他駕駛者的視線，而商用車由於一般體積較大，如違泊迫使途人「攝車罅」，對過馬路的行人，尤其是長者及幼童，構成的風險更高。因此，政府本着保障市民生命安全的重大原則，需要對商用車和私家車違泊罰款水平的處理一致。今次違泊定額罰款的加幅較自上次修訂以來的通脹率比較實屬溫和，而政府亦會一如前述積極改善及增加泊位供應。

主席，我建議根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》第13條，將該條例訂明有關違例泊車的定額罰款，調高25%，由現時320元調高至400元，以及根據《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》第12條，將該條例附表內與道路安全和交通擠塞有關的其中19項罪行的定額罰款，調高50%，由現時的320元至1,000元不等，調高至480元至1,500元不等，生效日期訂定為二○二六年一月一日。

在動議獲立法會通過後，警務處處長將按該兩條條例的條文指明新的罰款通知書及電子罰款通知書的格式，而房屋委員會亦將對《房屋（交通違例事項）（定額罰款）附例》的指定表格，即定額罰款通知書，作出相應修訂。

主席，我謹此陳辭，希望能獲得議會支持，通過議案。多謝主席。"

答覆：

主席：

近年，釣魚訊息的詐騙手法盛行，騙徒會假扮一些知名商戶，套取市民的信用卡資料和銀行戶口資料騙取金錢。有見及此，香港金融管理局（金管局）聯同香港銀行公會在二○二三年六月推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章1.0》（《約章1.0》），旨在提高公眾對保護信用卡及個人資料的意識。全港共有23間發卡銀行和15間大型商戶參與《約章1.0》，承諾不會透過任何即時電子訊息向客戶發送超連結要求他們於線上提供個人和信用卡資料，並會通過各種渠道向公眾傳遞「提防騙案」的訊息。

因應詐騙手法擴展至偽冒各類金融機構，如銀行、證券商、保險公司或強積金（強制性公積金）受託人等，金管局在二○二四年四月推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》（《約章2.0》）。《約章2.0》獲得超過300間金融機構及商戶參與，涵蓋更多日常生活範疇，包括金融服務、餐飲、物流、運輸、旅遊、零售等。

有見詐騙情況日趨複雜，騙徒除了使用傳統的電訊工具，例如電話或手機短訊嘗試接觸受害人，亦透過網上平台犯案。國際間，各地政府與監管機構逐漸意識到科技和電訊公司在打擊詐騙和欺詐行為上的重要角色。金管局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會、保險業監管局，以及強制性公積金計劃管理局於二○二五年七月聯合推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章3.0》（《約章3.0》），以期透過與科技和電訊公司建立合作框架，共同打擊針對香港公眾的金融詐騙及欺詐行為。《約章3.0》亦得到消費者委員會、香港銀行公會、香港警務處及通訊事務管理局辦公室的全力支持。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢金管局，我現答覆如下：

（一）金管局一直有檢視《約章1.0》與《約章2.0》的執行情況。根據警方的數字，釣魚詐騙從二○二三年的4 322宗下降至二○二四年的2 731宗，涉及損失由二○二三年的1億2百萬港元下降至二○二四年的5千4百萬港元，反映《約章1.0》和《約章2.0》有助提高公眾對釣魚詐騙的認識，對防範釣魚詐騙發揮了一定成效。

（二）《約章3.0》將參與機構擴展至科技和電訊公司，標誌着金融、科技和電訊業共同合作打擊騙案的新開始。《約章3.0》旨在提升四方面的果效。第一，在舉報疑似詐騙和欺詐方面，參與機構將為用戶提供舉報功能，並為金融監管機構提供直接高效的渠道，以舉報疑似詐騙和欺詐的行為，作出適當跟進。第二，在檢查廣告商方面，參與機構將採取風險為本的方針驗證廣告商，並制訂內部政策和工具，以監察其平台上的金融產品或服務的廣告及內容。第三，在移除詐騙廣告方面，參與機構承諾切實執行其服務條款，偵測及移除違反其平台政策的金融詐騙廣告或內容。第四，在提高公眾防騙意識方面，參與機構將與金融監管機構及金融業界合作，推出各種反詐騙宣傳活動，以提高公眾防騙意識。

《約章3.0》促成的跨界別合作，將令騙徒行騙的難度增加，從而幫助市民防範騙案和減少損失。

（三）《約章3.0》涵蓋在香港經營的主要海外和內地資訊科技平台（包括即時通訊軟件、社交媒體、影音串流和搜尋引擎），以及近乎所有香港的主要電訊服務供應商，包括固定網絡營辦商、流動網絡營辦商和互聯網服務供應商。由於參與《約章3.0》的科技和電訊公司所經營的平台以及提供的服務各有不同，各平台可按情況，自身的業務範圍及商業模式，相稱地採納措施，以落實執行《約章3.0》的原則。此安排既可善用各間科技和電訊公司自身的工具和優勢進行防範詐騙和保障用戶的工作，亦可保留彈性應對不斷演變的行騙手法和犯案模式，以加強香港整體反詐騙生態圈的能力和效果。金管局聯同其他監管機構會與參與機構保持溝通，確保參與機構能因應自身的服務模式和最新的騙案手法採取有效的措施，協助市民防騙。

打擊金融詐騙需要社會各界共同努力。政府將持續採取多方面措施，優化跨界別協作，以在更好保障市民的同時，鞏固香港的金融體系安全。

謝謝主席。"
LCQ6: Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter,2025-07-30 14:18,2025-07-30 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000405.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Chun-ying and a reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the Hong Kong Association of Banks, launched the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter (Charter) and the Charter 2.0 in 2023 and last year respectively. In July this year, HKMA launched the Charter 3.0 in collaboration with other regulators, with a view to jointly combatting financial fraud and scams targeting the Hong Kong public through establishing a collaborative framework with technology firms and telecommunications firms. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows if HKMA has, since the launch of the Charter and the Charter 2.0, reviewed participating institutions' implementation of the various principles under the Charter and the Charter 2.0 and the effectiveness thereof; if HKMA has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as the Charter 3.0 further extends the co-operating parties to include the technology and telecommunications sectors, so as to combat financial fraud through cross-sector co-operation, of the specific objectives which the Government and HKMA expect to achieve, and the performance indicators formulated for such objectives; and

(3) as the Charter 3.0 provides that participating institutions will fulfill Charter commitments based on their business models in a voluntary manner, how HKMA ensures, on this premise, that participating institutions can effectively dovetail with the policy direction and deliver the overall intended outcomes?

Reply:

President,

 In recent years, phishing scams have become prevalent. Scammers would pose as reputable merchants to obtain citizens' credit card and bank account details for monetary gain. In response, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) jointly launched the ""Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter"" (Charter 1.0) in June 2023 to enhance public awareness of safeguarding credit card and personal information. All 23 card-issuing banks and 15 merchant institutions in Hong Kong participated in Charter 1.0, committing not to send instant electronic messages to customers with embedded hyperlinks to request personal and credit card information online, and to convey the message of ""Beware of scams"" to the public through various channels.

 As scammers expanded their tactics to impersonate various financial institutions, such as banks, securities firms, insurers, Mandatory Provident Fund trustees, the HKMA introduced the ""Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0"" (Charter 2.0) in April 2024. Over 300 financial institutions and merchants joined Charter 2.0, extending its coverage to more aspects of daily life, including financial services, food and beverage, logistics, transport, tourism, retail.

 Scams continue to evolve. Scammers not only use traditional telecommunications tools like phone calls or SMS to reach out to victims, but also exploit online platforms. Governments and regulators worldwide have increasingly recognised the critical role of technology and telecommunications firms in combating scams and fraud. The HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority jointly launched the ""Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 3.0"" (Charter 3.0) in July 2025, to establish a collaborative framework with technology and telecommunications firms to combat financial scams and fraud targeting the Hong Kong public. Charter 3.0 also received full support from the Consumer Council, the HKAB, the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Office of the Communications Authority.

 Having consulted the HKMA, my reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) The HKMA has been reviewing the implementation of Charter 1.0 and Charter 2.0. Statistics from the HKPF show that the number of phishing scams decreased from 4 322 in 2023 to 2 731 in 2024, with losses dropping from HK$102 million to HK$54 million over the same period. This reflects that Charter 1.0 and Charter 2.0 have helped raise public awareness and curb phishing scams.

(2) Charter 3.0 expands participation to include technology and telecommunications firms, marking a new chapter of cross-sector collaboration among financial, technology and telecommunications industries in combating fraud. Charter 3.0 aims to enhance effectiveness in four key areas. First, regarding reporting of suspected scams and fraud, participating firms will put in place user reporting functions and establish direct and efficient channels for financial regulators to report and follow up on suspected scams and fraud. Second, for vetting of advertisers, participating firms will adopt a risk-based approach to verify advertisers, while developing internal policies and tools to monitor the advertisements and contents on their platforms relating to financial products or services. Third, concerning removal of fraudulent advertisements, participating firms commit to enforcing their terms of service by detecting and removing financial scam advertisements or contents which violate platform policies. Fourth, for enhancing public awareness, participating firms will collaborate with financial regulators and the financial industry to launch various anti-scam campaigns to raise public vigilance against scams.

 The cross-sector collaboration enabled by Charter 3.0 will raise the barriers to execute scams, while helping the public better protect themselves against scams and reduce potential losses.

(3) Charter 3.0 covers major overseas and Mainland information technology platforms operating in Hong Kong, including instant messaging app, social media, video streaming and search engine, as well as nearly all major telecommunications service providers, including fixed network operators, mobile network operators and internet service providers. Given the diversity of platforms and services, participating firms will adopt proportionate measures based on their business scopes and models as appropriate, to implement the principles in Charter 3.0. This approach allows technology and telecommunications firms to leverage their tools and strengths to prevent scams and safeguard their users, and provide them with the flexibility to adapt to evolving tactics and patterns of scams, with a view to enhancing the capacity and effectiveness of Hong Kong's overall anti-scam ecosystem. The HKMA, together with other regulators, will maintain communication with participating firms to ensure effective measures are tailored to their service models and the latest scam tactics, thereby helping the public guard against scams.

 Combating financial scams requires collective efforts across different sectors of society. The Government will continue to implement multi-faceted measures and enhance cross-sector collaboration, so as to strengthen the security of Hong Kong's financial system while providing better protection for the public.

 Thank you, President."

答覆：

主席：

家族辦公室業務是香港資產及財富管理業的重要一環。根據投資推廣署委聘的顧問所作研究，估計在二○二三年底約有2 700間單一家族辦公室在港營辦，預計很快增至3 000間。截至二○二四年年底，香港的私人銀行和私人財富管理業務中，來自家族辦公室和私人信託客戶的資產規模達15,510億港元，為資產及財富管理業和其他相關專業服務帶來龐大商機。就問題的各部分，經諮詢稅務局及投資推廣署後，現回覆如下。

（一）政府於二○二三年三月發表《有關香港發展家族辦公室業務的政策宣言》（《政策宣言》），提出八大措施，以締造具競爭力的有利環境，讓全球家族辦公室和資產擁有人的業務在香港蓬勃發展。作為其中一項支援措施，《2023年稅務（修訂）（家族投資控權工具的稅務寬減）條例》自二○二三年五月十九日起生效並適用於二○二二年四月一日或之後開始的課稅年度。由單一家族辦公室在香港管理，並符合2.4億港元的最低資產門檻及實質活動要求的家族投資控權工具（家控工具），其合資格交易可獲豁免繳付利得稅。

家族辦公室業界對《政策宣言》提出的措施，包括稅務優惠制度、「新資本投資者入境計劃」（「新計劃」）及香港財富傳承學院（財富傳承學院）的反應良好，而有興趣在港設立或擴展業務的家族辦公室數目亦有所上升。然而，由於稅務寬減制度仍屬起步階段，因此在二○二二／二三及二○二三／二四課稅年度申請稅務寬減的家控工具為數較少，而為免洩露納稅人的身分，相關數據並不宜公開。此外，由於業界需時調整營運模式以符合獲得稅務寬減的資格，現階段的申請數字未必適合作為反映稅務寬減制度成效的指標。

（二）及（三）政府積極推動家族辦公室的業務發展，增強香港資產及財富管理和相關專業界別的發展優勢，並一直與家族辦公室業界保持緊密溝通，了解家族辦公室的發展需要。投資推廣署的家族辦公室團隊（專責團隊）在二○二五年首五個月已協助50間家族辦公室在港設立或擴展業務，較去年同期上升百分之十九，另有約150間家族辦公室表示正準備或已決定在港設立或擴展業務。自專責團隊於二○二一年六月成立以來的相關數據表列如下：

經專責團隊與家族辦公室業界理解，有意或已在香港設立家族辦公室的人士普遍關注的範疇包括相關合規要求、稅務優惠及專業人才供應等。然而，專責團隊並沒有收集家族辦公室辦公空間的相關數據。一般而言，個別家族辦公室對其辦公空間的地點、私隱度、設施配套等有不同的要求，亦可能考慮營運成本及是否毗鄰專業服務機構等。

因應業界提出的意見，並為加強「新計劃」與在港設立家族辦公室兩者之間帶來協同效應，政府已於二○二五年三月一日起實施優化措施，包括容許申請人透過由《稅務條例》附表16E第2條所界定的具資格單一家族辦公室管理，並由申請人全資擁有的合資格私人公司進行「新計劃」下的投資並計入合資格投資金額內。

同時，政府致力壯大財富管理及家族辦公室人才庫，以滿足家族辦公室對專業人才的需求。我們自二○一六年起推行提升資產財富管理業人才培訓先導計劃，以培養更多業界人才。計劃至今有超過4 800宗合資格專業培訓課程的學費資助申請獲批，並為超過1 100名大專學生提供實習機會，支持業界提供更多專業培訓及學習機會，提升從業員的專業水平。此外，我們分別自二○一八年及二○二一年把「資產及財富管理專才」及「資產及財富管理合規專才」納入「人才清單」，以便利有關專業的優秀人才來港發展。政府亦於二○二三年成立財富傳承學院，以提供交流協作、知識分享和人才培訓的平台，並為資產擁有人和財富繼承者、家族辦公室業界提供相關培訓。

（四）政府已在二○二五至二六財政年度政府《財政預算案》公布進一步優化單一家族辦公室的優惠稅制的建議，包括增加單一家族辦公室享有稅務寬減的合資格交易種類，例如碳排放衍生工具／排放限額、保險相連證券、貸款及私募債權投資和數碼資產的交易等，以吸引更多家族辦公室來港落戶。政府已就優化優惠稅制的措施完成業界諮詢，並正就收集到的意見與金融監管機構商討相關優化措施。政府的目標是在今年內制訂具體方案，並於二○二六年把立法建議提交立法會審議。如獲通過，有關措施可於二○二五／二六課稅年度起生效。

現時的家族辦公室優惠稅制並不包括聯合家族辦公室所管理的家控工具，原因是聯合家族辦公室一般屬獨立的服務提供者，並非由有關家族所擁有。聯合家族辦公室或會為第三方提供投資管理服務或其他金融服務，實際上與銀行、私人銀行及資產及財富管理公司的業務無異。再者，如不同家族的家控工具由聯合家族辦公室管理，亦難以確定相關家控工具是否符合最低資產門檻和實質活動要求。我們須審慎研究將稅務優惠措施進一步擴大至聯合家族辦公室的實際效益及對財政的相關影響。

另一方面，如家控工具符合《稅務條例》下「基金」的定義並由證券及期貨事務監察委員會持牌機構（包括聯合家族辦公室）在香港進行或安排合資格交易，現已可循統一基金免稅制度就相關交易獲得稅務寬免。"

In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) for the two years of assessment 2022-2023 and 2023-2024, of the following information on the single family offices eligible for the profits tax concession under the Amendment Ordinance in each year: (i) the number, (ii) the average number of full-time employees, (iii) ‍the average operating expenditure, as well as (iv) the average amount and (v) the total amount of tax reduction received, and set out in the table below with a breakdown by the size of asset under management (AUM) (i.e. (a) $240 million to below $390 million, (b)‍ ‍$390 ‍million to below $780 million, and (c) $780 million or above);

(3) of the number of family offices that have been established in Hong Kong with the assistance or facilitation of the dedicated FamilyOfficeHK team of Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) since 2021, and the respective numbers of inquiries and follow-up cases handled; among these cases, of the common concerns of individuals who are interested in or have already established family offices in Hong Kong (set out by key areas of concern); and

(4) as the Government has earlier on indicated that it would further enhance the preferential tax regime for family offices, will the Government consider expanding the scope of the preferential tax regime to cover multi-family offices?

Reply:

President,

 Family office (FO) business is an important segment of the asset and wealth management (WAM) sector in Hong Kong. According to the research findings of the consultant commissioned by Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK), there were around 2 700 single FOs operating in Hong Kong as of end-2023. The number is expected to exceed 3 000 in the near future. As of end-2024, the size of private banking and private wealth management business attributed to FOs and private trusts clients reached HK$1,551 billion, providing significant business opportunities for the WAM sector and other related professional services. In consultation with the Inland Revenue Department and InvestHK, the reply to various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) The Government issued the Policy Statement on Developing Family Office Businesses in Hong Kong in March 2023 to set out eight measures with a view to creating a conducive and competitive environment for the businesses of global FOs and asset owners to thrive in Hong Kong. As one of the support measures, the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (Tax Concessions for Family-owned Investment Holding Vehicles) Ordinance 2023 came into operation on May 19, 2023, and applies in respect of a year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2022. Family-owned investment holding vehicles (FIHVs) managed by single FOs in Hong Kong fulfilling the minimum asset threshold of HK$240 million and substantial activities requirement can enjoy profits tax exemption for qualifying transactions.

 The FO sector has responded positively to the measures set out in the Policy Statement, including the preferential tax regime, the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (New CIES) and the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy (HKAWL). The number of FOs interested in setting up or expanding their business in Hong Kong has also increased. That said, a relatively small number of applications for tax concession for FIHVs have been received in the years of assessment 2022/23 and 2023/24 as the tax concession regime is still at its early stage. In this light, it may not be appropriate to disclose relevant data to avoid disclosing the information of the taxpayers. Furthermore, since the industry needs time to adjust their operations in order to meet the eligibility requirements for tax concession, the current number of applications may not be an appropriate indicator of the effectiveness of the tax concession regime.

(2) and (3) The Government actively promotes the development of FO business and strengthens advantages in developing the WAM industry and related professional service sectors in Hong Kong. The Government has maintained close communication with the FO sector to understand the development needs of FOs. The dedicated FamilyOfficeHK team of InvestHK has already assisted 50 FOs to set up or expand their business in Hong Kong in the first five months of 2025, representing a 19 per cent increase compared with the same period last year. Separately, around 150 FOs have indicated that they are preparing or have decided to set up or expand their business in Hong Kong. The statistics since the establishment of the dedicated team in June 2021 are summarised as follows:

 For those who intend to or have set up FOs in Hong Kong, the dedicated team understands from the FO sector that their general areas of concern include compliance requirements, tax incentives and the availability of professionals, etc. However, the dedicated team does not maintain relevant statistics of the office space of FOs. Generally speaking, individual FOs have different requirements for the location, privacy and supporting facilities of their office space, and may also consider the operating costs and proximity to professional service firms, etc.

 In response to the industry's view and to enhance the synergy between the New CIES and the establishment of FOs in Hong Kong, the Government has implemented enhancement measures with effect from March 1, 2025, including allowing applicants to make investments under the New CIES through an eligible private company managed by an eligible single FO as defined in Section 2 of Schedule 16E to the Inland Revenue Ordinance (IRO) and wholly owned by the applicant. These investments can be counted towards the applicant's eligible investment.

 To meet the needs by FOs for professional talents, the Government is committed to expanding the talent pool in wealth management and FOs. We have since 2016 implemented the Pilot Programme to Enhance Talent Training for the Asset and Wealth Management Sector to nurture more industry talents. To date, over 4 800 applications for reimbursement of eligible professional training course fees have been approved, and the Programme has provided internship opportunities for over 1 100 tertiary students, supporting the industry to offer more professional training and learning opportunities, thereby enhancing the professional standards of practitioners. Besides, we have included ""management professionals in WAM"" and ""professionals in compliance in WAM"" under the Talent List since 2018 and 2021 respectively, so as to facilitate high-quality talents in these professions to pursue development in Hong Kong. The Government has also established the HKAWL in 2023 to provide a platform for collaboration, networking, knowledge sharing and talent development, and to provide relevant training for asset owners, wealth inheritors and the FO sector.

(4) The Government has announced in the 2025-26 Budget proposals to further enhance the preferential tax regime for single FOs, including increasing the types of qualifying transactions eligible for tax concessions for single FOs, such as transactions in emission derivatives/allowances, insurance-linked securities, loans and private credit investments, and digital assets, to attract more FOs to establish a presence in Hong Kong. The Government has completed the industry consultation on the enhancement measures on the preferential tax regimes, and is formulating the relevant enhancement measures in consultation with financial regulators based on the feedback received. The Government targets to work out the details by this year and submit the legislative proposals to the Legislative Council for consideration in 2026. If approved, the relevant measures will take effect from the year of assessment 2025/26.

 The current preferential tax regime for FOs does not cover FIHVs managed by multi-FOs as they are generally independent service providers which are not owned by the relevant families. Multi-FOs may engage in the provision of investment management services or other financial services for third parties, which are essentially no different from the business of banks, private banks and WAM companies. Furthermore, if FIHVs of different families are managed by multi-FOs, there may also be difficulties in ascertaining whether the minimum asset threshold and substantial activities requirement of the FIHVs concerned are met. We need to critically examine the actual effectiveness and related fiscal implications of further extending the tax incentives to multi-FOs.

 On the other hand, where an FIHV meets the definition of ""fund"" under the IRO and the qualifying transactions are carried out or arranged in Hong Kong by a licensed corporation of the Securities and Futures Commission (including multi-FOs), currently the relevant transactions are already eligible for tax exemption under the unified tax regime for funds."

Stall enhancement works to commence August 1 in Ap Lei Chau Market Cooked Food Centre and Luen Wo Hui Market Cooked Food Centre,2025-07-30 14:00,2025-07-30 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000311.htm,"âA spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (July 30) that stall enhancement works in the Ap Lei Chau Market Cooked Food Centre and the Luen Wo Hui Market Cooked Food Centre will commence on August 1 (Friday) to improve their operating environments and enhance the dining experiences for the public. To facilitate the smooth implementation of the works, both cooked food centres will be temporarily closed with effect from the same date.

The stall enhancement works in the Ap Lei Chau Market Cooked Food Centre and the Luen Wo Hui Market Cooked Food Centre will mainly focus on upgrading the dining areas and stall portals, including beautifying or replacing ceilings, walls, floor tiles and lighting fixtures, as well as reconfiguring dining furniture, etc. The FEHD will also undertake other repair and maintenance works, including the replacement or repair of electrical and mechanical equipment and building services installations within the cooked food centres. The Ap Lei Chau Market Cooked Food Centre and the Luen Wo Hui Market Cooked Food Centre are expected to be completed by April and July next year respectively.

The Government has been implementing the Market Modernisation Programme (MMP) since 2018. Through overhaul or redevelopment projects, stall enhancement projects and minor refurbishment or improvement works, the MMP improves the operating environment of existing public markets, assists with tenants' business operations and provides a more pleasant shopping environment. The Queen Street Cooked Food Market was the first stall enhancement project under the MMP. The relevant works commenced in February 2024 and the Market resumed full operation in September of the same year. Following its reopening, the average daily footfall of the Queen Street Cooked Food Market has increased by over 10 per cent compared with that before the enhancement works. The Market has generally been operating smoothly and provides a modern and comfortable dining environment for the public. The FEHD will continue to take forward the MMP to implement projects of various scales at suitable markets, with a view to keeping public markets abreast with the times to meet public needs."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-07-30 13:12,2025-07-30 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000424.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (July 30) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

政務司司長出席立法會前廳交流會後會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-07-30 12:58,2025-07-30 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000399.htm,"政務司司長陳國基今日（七月三十日）上午聯同教育局局長蔡若蓮博士、署理勞工及福利局局長何啟明、立法會教育事務委員會主席周文港博士和立法會人力事務委員會主席林振昇，出席立法會前廳交流會後會見傳媒。以下是陳國基會見傳媒的談話內容：

政務司司長：各位傳媒朋友早晨。剛剛我們舉行了第20次立法會前廳交流會，與一眾出席議員深入討論如何更好推動教育、科技和人才一體化發展，為香港發展的改革和創新提供堅實支持，我亦在剛才的環節收到很多寶貴意見。

教育、科技和人才三者環環相扣，是發展新質生產力、推動高質量發展、全面建設中國式現代化的基礎性、戰略性支撐。

行政長官在去年《施政報告》宣布成立教育、科技和人才委員會 （教科人委），由我擔任主席，以「八大中心」的戰略定位和優勢作為基礎，推動育才、匯才、科技協同發展，同時推動國際高端人才集聚香港，助力香港經濟發展，貢獻國家發展動能。

教科人委成立以來，一直積極與各界持分者保持溝通，包括大學校長、創科業界、諮詢組織等，希望凝聚智慧，加強合作，推展委員會的工作；而立法會當然亦是我們推展工作的一個重要合作夥伴。

教科人委正在按三大策略工作方向推進，包括（一）吸納優秀創科人才、（二）建立國際教育樞紐，及（三）優化人才計劃和人才服務。今日前廳交流會就三個議題都有互動，我們聽到很多議員提出各樣的看法和建議，在推展工作時會仔細整合和參考這些意見。

優化人才計劃和人才服務

在優化人才計劃和人才服務方面，政府自二○二二年年底推出多項「搶人才」措施，豐富本地人才庫，反應非常熱烈。各項便利措施，加上香港的發展機遇，成功吸引不同界別的全球精英來到香港發展。

截至今年六月底，各項人才入境計劃共收到接近50萬宗申請，當中近33萬宗已獲批准，已有接近22萬人才攜同他們的家人抵港，遠超之前的目標，即三年合共引入105 000名人才的目標，已遠遠超過。

教科人委自成立以來，強調通過改革創新，實現破局。教科人委已經通過在優秀人才入境計劃下，設立主動邀請頂尖及領軍人才來香港的突破性安排，針對國家及香港各方面所需，積極遊說目標頂尖人才來香港發展。

過程中，政府會為獲邀人士提供各項具吸引力的個人化便利安排。當然，大家都明白，這些頂尖人才都是世界各地希望羅致的對象，為避免影響遊說，我們暫時未能透露更多邀請機制的具體運作細節，包括現正邀請哪些人，我們暫時不方便透露。

但當然，政府會主動出擊，向從事科技研究的機構、大專院校等介紹邀請機制，讓這些機構為配合這個突破性招攬頂尖及領軍人才的新機制做好準備。如果他們覺得在他們的領域中有哪些人才對香港很有利，可以向我們提出，我們在研究後，會主動向這些人才提出邀請。

另一方面，我們在五月底宣布新增渠道，引入指定技術工種專才來香港，投身人力極短缺的技術工種。新安排已於六月三十日起接受申請。

我們亦會繼續透過香港人才服務辦公室，吸引及支援世界各地人才來港發展，當中包括革新線上平台、擴大合作夥伴網絡、與業界及僱主團體合辦招聘會、外訪等，更全面支援人才來港發展和落戶。

議員都十分支持政府各項的招攬人才措施，為香港各行各業的發展提供長期的人力支撐，並提出很多寶貴意見。我們回去後會仔細研究及考慮，務求鞏固香港的競爭優勢，繼續吸引世界各地的人才來到香港發展。

吸納優秀創科人才

不少議員都認同要用好河套香港園區（河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區），為創科人才提供更多發展機會。

我們會把握河套香港園區即將投入營運的契機，積極引入重點創科企業在園區設立或擴展業務，同時借助各項推動構建完整創科產業生態鏈的措施，形成人才與產業互相促進的良性循環，充分發揮以產聚才的作用。

而在吸引海外創科人才方面，議員支持用好現有多個不同的人才入境計劃，並就科技人才入境計劃提出了不少意見。我們正在全面檢討這個便利海外科技人才到香港進行研發工作的計劃，當中包括研究進一步簡化申請程序、適度優化簽證條件及工作限制等。我們會通盤考慮議員及業界的建議，確保能夠更積極有效促進香港的科技公司招聘非本地科技人才，加強推動香港創科發展。

建立國際教育樞紐

我們亦跟議員研究各項建設國際教育樞紐、為「八大中心」和科技創新提供人才支撐的措施。

教育是培育人才的關鍵。香港擁有良好的教育基建，享譽國際的大學，優秀的科研人才，教學質量在多項國際比較研究中名列前茅，更是唯一擁有五所世界百強大學的城市。

為了讓人才的培育更配合國家和香港的策略發展及政策優次，政府主動作為，引領教資會（大學教育資助委員會）資助大學在規劃過程中，開辦切合發展所需的課程。

在二○二五至二○二八的三年期，各教資會資助大學會合共新增27項與STEAM及國家「十四五」規劃下「八大中心」相關的學士學位課程，包括人工智能、創意產業、數據科學等，鞏固香港創科和「八大中心」發展的同時，推動社會及經濟更趨多元化。

政府亦會致力發展北都大學教育城，鼓勵本地專上院校與中外知名院校以靈活創新的模式，開拓更多品牌課程、研究合作和交流項目。我們計劃在二○二六年上半年或更早的時間盡快公布北都大學教育城概念發展綱要，進一步支持香港發展成為國際專上教育樞紐，並配合國家發展戰略作出更大貢獻。

政府亦通過多項措施，包括獎學金計劃等，全方位吸引各地優秀人才到香港留學，並透過不同便利安排，讓他們在畢業後在香港落地生根，壯大香港的人才庫。

我們在二○二四至二五學年起，提升教資會資助大學錄取非本地學生限額一倍至40%；而過去五年，非本地學生人數大增約37%，至現時的約26 600人，創歷來新高。他們修讀不同的學士學位以至博士學位課程，為香港的未來發展注入新動能。

學生宿舍的充足供應是繼續吸引非本地學生來港留學的重要配套。教科人委以創新靈活方式，拆牆鬆綁，結合市場力量，增加學生宿舍供應。政府已經推出城中學舍計劃，就發展管制程序拆牆鬆綁，鼓勵市場把商廈改裝為學生宿舍，增加學生宿位供應，鞏固香港作為國際專上教育樞紐的地位。

議員就不同培育人才及建立國際教育樞紐的措施都非常踴躍發表意見，大家都熱烈討論如何更好地為國家及香港未來發展提供更強的人才支撐，分享了很多想法和建議，我們會好好梳理分析，教科人委會積極跟進。

現在，我請人力事務委員會主席林振昇議員，以及教育事務委員會主席周文港議員向大家分享一下剛才交流會的重點。

記者：司長你好，想問關於昨日黑雨，知道政府沒有召開極端天氣督導小組，可否解釋一下，其實在甚麼情況下才需要召開督導小組？之前的殘餘颱風影響比較小而有召開，這次影響較大但沒有召開，準則在哪裏？第二條問題關於人才，見到「小紅書」有教學，教內地女士來港讀Master（碩士）學位，順便在香港產子，司長有沒有留意到網上有這樣的教學？這些行為會否構成違法，或違背了政府輸入人才的原則？謝謝。

政務司司長：好，多謝你的提問，我首先回答你第二個問題。其實任何人才入境計劃的目的都是招攬人才來港，他們申請時一定要說明來港的目的是為了工作，如有其他目的，例如來港是為了產子而不是工作，就很可能構成虛假陳述，這當然是不合法的。我們希望所有人才——全世界亦如是——來港的話，一定要按照自己申請的目的去做，而不是申請這個（目的），但實際上是其他目標，這就有機會違反法例。不過我相信你所說只是一個很少數的情況，最近我們收到大量申請，他們都是踏踏實實在香港工作，落地生根，我亦看不到有大量人士來港，實際上是為了產子多於工作，我覺得這個情況不多，也是不應該的。

第二，關於應對極端天氣督導委員會。首先我想澄清一點，在香港，經過這麼多年，我們已有一套很完整的方法去應對極端天氣，以前大家都知道，一到八號風球（八號熱帶氣旋警告信號）或黑雨（黑色暴雨警告信號），天文台會預早公布何時發出，有時會提早兩小時通知大家，各部門亦會「埋位」，做好他們應該做的事。我們亦有一個緊急事故監察及支援中心，有各相關部門的首長級同事，負責24小時監察颱風或暴雨導致香港水浸、山泥傾瀉或塌樹的情況，立即去處理，這套機制行之有效。為甚麼會有一個應對極端天氣督導委員會的產生呢？其實是我們再想多一步，當有些極端天氣我們預測會發生時，而這個極端天氣不是一般普通的八號風球，而是會對香港造成廣泛和嚴重的破壞，這樣我們就要特別留意，就要提前召開這個委員會，讓所有部門提前關注、提前警惕、提前「埋位」，做好更多的準備，這是保障香港市民生命財產的一個重要安排。

以昨天的暴雨為例，天文台昨日已經解釋過，這個暴雨發展得很快，是（上午）八至九時左右突然發展，而且雨勢比較集中，有幾區特別大，這不是預先可以估計得很清楚。當時一宣布黑雨後，其實我們的緊急事故監察及支援中心已經即時運作，各部門亦即時工作，按照其機制去處理。我相信大家昨日都看到，無論水浸也好、塌樹事件也好，或有阻路情況也好，很快就可以解決，證明了我們行之有效的機制是相當有效。

記者：樹仁（香港樹仁大學）的創辦人兼校監胡鴻烈數日前逝世。作為樹仁校友，你如何評價這位校監？

政務司司長：我當然認識胡鴻烈校監，因為我作為他的學生，我覺得他與他太太，即鍾期榮校長，給我最大的一個感受，就是他們是真真正正的教育家，為教育奉獻一生的精力和財產。

大家看看他們兩位的資歷或者經歷，在他們那個年代，我想如果他在法律界發展，相信可以享受很豐裕的生活，但他們沒有作此選擇。他們選擇了教育，因為他們認為當時的專上教育不足，所以創辦一間私立專上學院，用他們自己的積蓄。我時常看到他們兩位在學校，穿着亦十分簡樸，把所有的積蓄都投放於學校。

我也覺得他是一位很值得我們敬重的人，也時常與學生傾談。我們很容易看見他，常常在學校碰見他。即使你不找他，他也找你聊天。我覺得他為我們作身教，也讓我們看到何謂為了理想，他可以如此堅持。所以一直以來他們兩位均受到我們學生或者同學，甚至社會各界高度尊重。"

問題：

香港大球場（大球場）是本港少數符合亞洲足球協會所訂立運動場規章標準的場地之一，可支持舉辦該協會認可的國際賽事。《行政長官2024年施政報告》提出，會重新檢視大球場改建計劃，確保啟德體育園和大球場發揮協同效應。有意見認為，大球場內部設施及周邊配套完整，具備支持體育產業化發展的潛力，可進一步彌補專業體育空間不足的問題。關於大球場的營運及發展，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年大球場的營運人手開支，以及維修和保養設施（例如草地、跑道、田徑設施，以及其他配套設施）的相關支出為何，並按項目以表列出分項資料；

（二）據悉除了運動場設施外，大球場內有50間行政人員廂房，亦有十數間餐廳、酒廊及酒吧，以及停車場、會議室和辦公室等設施，過去三年每年大球場各項設施的收入情況為何，包括場地及設施租金（例如出租場地供運動訓練、活動及賽事用途，以及廂房租賃）、餐飲及零售服務收入，以及導賞服務收入等（以表列出）；

（三）過去三年（i）大球場的使用率，以及（ii）在大球場舉辦的活動的以下資料：舉辦日期、入場人數、活動規模、活動類型（例如足球賽事或社區活動）及場地租用者類別（例如體育機構、社區團體或商業機構等）（以表列出）；

（四）鑑於政府早年曾提出改建大球場，以將其轉型為公眾運動場並將座位數目縮減至9 000個，但社會有意見認為政府應保留大球場現時的規模及進一步將其發展為體育賽事專門場地，以配合發展體育專業化和產業化的需要，並應全面評估區內實際體育設施需求後才再作規劃，政府有否系統性分析區內同類型運動場及體育設施的具體數據（例如使用率），以對大球場的改建方案及有關需求進行有效評估；及

（五）鑑於康樂及文化事務署（康文署）早前公布經改革的表演場地使用政策及措施，以為表演場地作更明確定位，並促進表演藝術的多元化、專業化、產業化及盛事化發展，當局會否參考有關做法，考慮就體育專業化和產業化發展提出改革方向，包括因應體育政策目標而重新調整大球場的定位，並全面檢討康文署營運大球場的成效，從而減輕政府財政壓力？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直致力推動體育發展，積極以多管齊下的模式落實普及化、精英化、盛事化、專業化和產業化五大政策目標。不同的大型體育基建和場地，包括香港大球場和剛於今年三月一日正式啓用的啟德體育園，對政府繼續發展體育產業和主場經濟至為重要。政府在二○二四年《施政報告》中提出會充分利用不同場地主辦大型國際賽事，為體育產業的長遠發展創造有利條件，確保香港大球場、啟德體育園和其他場地發揮協同效應，以善用香港不同的場地推動體育以至盛事經濟的發展。

LCQ11: Operation and development of Hong Kong Stadium,2025-07-30 12:50,2025-07-30 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000333.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Fok and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

Hong Kong Stadium (HKS) is one of the few venues in Hong Kong that meets the standards stipulated in the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Stadium Regulations, enabling it to host AFC-sanctioned international matches. ""The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address"" proposed that a fresh review of the redevelopment plan for the HKS will be conducted to ensure its synergy with the Kai Tak Sports Park. There are views that the HKS, with its comprehensive internal facilities and supporting infrastructure, has the potential to support the development of sports as an industry, which can further make up for the shortage of professional sports venues. Regarding the operation and development of the HKS, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the operational staffing costs of the HKS in the past three years, as well as the expenditures incurred on the repair and maintenance of facilities (e.g. turf, athletics tracks, field facilities and other ancillary facilities), with a tabulated breakdown by item;

(2) as it is learnt that apart from the sports ground facilities, there are a total of 50 executive suites, a dozen of restaurants, lounges and bars, as well as facilities such as car parks, conference rooms and offices in the HKS, of the revenues generated from the various HKS facilities in each of the past three years, including venue and facility rental income (e.g. the rental of venues for sports training, events and competitions, as well as the rental of suites), catering and retail service income, as well as guided tour service income (set out in a table);

(3) of (i) the utilisation rate of the HKS and (ii) the following information on the events held at the HKS in the past three years: dates, attendances, event scale, event type (e.g. football matches or community activities) and venue hirer type (e.g. sports organisations, community groups or commercial organisations) (set out in a table);

(4) given that the Government proposed in earlier years to redevelop the HKS by converting it into a public sports ground and reducing its seating capacity to 9 000, but there are views in the community that the Government should retain the current scale of HKS and further develop it into a venue dedicated to sports events to meet the needs of developing sports professionalism and sports as an industry, and that it should conduct a comprehensive assessment of the actual demand for sports facilities in the district before making further planning, whether the Government has systematically analysed the specific data (e.g. utilisation rates) on similar sports grounds and sports facilities in the district, so as to effectively assess the redevelopment plan for HKS and the relevant demands; and

(5) given that the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) earlier on announced a reformed hiring policy and measures for its performance venues, aiming to establish clearer venue identities, and foster a diversified, professional, industry and mega-event development of performing arts, whether the authorities will, by making reference to such practice, consider proposing a reform direction for the development of sports professionalism and sports as an industry, including realigning the positioning of HKS in line with sports policy objectives, and conducting a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the LCSD in operating the HKS, so as to alleviate the financial pressure on the Government?

Reply:

President,

The Government has all along been committed to promoting sports development proactively through a multi-pronged approach with a view to implementing the five key policy objectives, namely promoting sports in the community, supporting elite sports, promoting Hong Kong as a centre for major international sports events, enhancing professionalism and developing sports as an industry. Various large-scale sports infrastructure and venues, including the Hong Kong Stadium (HKS) and the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) which was officially commissioned on March 1 of this year, are crucial for the Government's continued development of both sports as an industry and the host city economy. In the 2024 Policy Address, the Government proposed to make full use of various venues to host large-scale international competitions. It aimed to create favourable conditions for the long-term development of the sports industry and ensure the synergy among the HKS, the KTSP and other venues, thereby making better use of various venues in Hong Kong to promote the development of sports and mega event economy.

My reply to the Hon Kenneth Fok's question is as follows:

(4) The Government once preliminarily considered to convert the HKS into a public sports ground after completion of the KTSP. In view of the imminent commissioning of the KTSP, the Government proposed in the 2024 Policy Address to review the redevelopment plan for the HKS. The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) will make reference to the operation of the KTSP as well as the demand and operation of other sports facilities to further assess and formulate the future positioning of the HKS and its long-term development with a view to complementing the strengths of relevant sports facilities to achieve greater synergy. At present, the HKS continues to serve as a major venue for large-scale events. A number of major sports events have been/will be held at HKS in 2025, including the exhibition match between the Hong Kong, China Representative Team and Manchester United in May, the open training of AC Milan last week at the Hong Kong Football Festival 2025, and the upcoming Saudi Super Cup in this August. We are open to any suggestions for making good use of the HKS.

(5) Commissioned in March this year, the KTSP offers multiple venues of international standard equipped with advanced facilities, providing excellent conditions and vast opportunities for promoting Hong Kong as a centre for major international sports events and supporting elite sports. Numerous large-scale sports events have been held at the KTSP within its first five months of opening, including the Hong Kong Sevens, the Volleyball Nations League Hong Kong 2025 and the Hong Kong Football Festival 2025 which is currently underway. The CSTB will closely monitor the usage of various venue facilities after the opening of the KTSP and review their positioning to fully leverage on the unique advantages of each venue in hosting different types of international and local competitions and maximise the synergy effect, thereby enhancing public interest in sports and expanding the audience of sports enthusiasts. This will further promote sports in the community and support elite sports while promoting Hong Kong as a centre for major international sports events and developing sports as an industry. When formulating the future positioning and long-term development of the HKS, the Government will also review its operational effectiveness to better utilise its role in promoting sports development."
立法會三題：非住宅物業,2025-07-30 12:45,2025-07-30 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000368.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上江玉歡議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的答覆：

問題：

有意見指出，由於近年經濟下行，非住宅物業（例如商鋪及寫字樓）的空置率持續上升，令業主承受沉重的經營壓力。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否考慮允許非住宅物業業主以分期方式繳付該等物業交易的印花稅，以紓緩業界的財務壓力；

（二）政府會否考慮推出政策誘因及措施，例如適度放寬外資或「新資本投資者入境計劃」申請人投資非住宅物業的限制、降低非住宅物業的印花稅率，以及提供融資優惠或簡化投資審批流程等，以吸引國際資本及促進市場交易的活躍度；及

（三）鑑於有非住宅物業業主反映，儘管近年其持有物業的租值下調，但仍需繳交高昂的差餉及地租，政府會否參考英國和澳洲等地方的做法，考慮推出臨時性的非住宅物業差餉寬減措施，以協助業主應對經濟下行的壓力？

答覆：

主席：

在回答江玉歡議員的提問前，我會首先簡介香港最新的整體經濟和非住宅物業的市場情況。

香港經濟穩健增長，二○二四全年實質本地生產總值上升百分之二點五，二○二五年第一季則按年上升百分之三點一，較上一季百分之二點五的升幅有所加快。但與此同時，根據差餉物業估價署（估價署）的資料，二○二四年年底私人寫字樓及私人商業樓宇的整體空置率分別為百分之十六點三及百分之十一點八，較二○二三年上升百分之一點四及百分之一點五。由此可見，非住宅物業空置率並非完全受香港整體經濟影響。其他相關的因素包括物業的供應量、企業本身的營運和發展狀況、本地市民和旅客消費模式轉變等。此外，業主亦會考慮多項因素以決定是否將空置物業出租，例如市場趨勢、自身的資產管理策略及財政狀況、租金水平等。

政府一直密切留意非住宅物業市場的情況和發展。考慮到近年寫字樓空置率及未來幾年非住宅物業的供應仍相對充足，政府由二○二三／二四年度起已暫停以招標形式推售商業用地，讓市場有空間消化現有供應。另外，政府積極招商引資，例如投資推廣署在二○二三年一月至二○二五年六月期間，協助超過1 300間海外及內地企業在港開設或擴展業務，有助帶動本地非住宅物業市場的需求。

就江議員提出的三個問題，現回覆如下：

（一）我們現時沒有計劃允許非住宅物業交易的印花稅以分期方式繳付，主要有三個考慮：

首先，現時非住宅物業交易的印花稅由100元至最高稅率百分之四點二五不等，僅佔交易成本極小部分，而最高稅率只適用於物業售價或價值高於約2,174萬元的交易。由於印花稅一般是由買家繳付，因此我們不認為現時繳付印花稅的安排會對非住宅物業業主構成財務壓力。

第二，根據《印花稅條例》，印花稅署署長須在印花稅繳付後才加蓋印花。換言之，分期繳付但未繳清印花稅的文書不可加蓋印花。一般而言，未加蓋印花的文書在民事糾紛的法律程序中不得被接納為證據，有關文書亦不能在土地註冊處辦理註冊。

第三，非住宅物業市場過去一年交投相對穩定。根據稅務局的資料，二○二五／二六年度首季共有約3 600宗加蓋印花申請涉及非住宅物業，較去年同期上升約百分之十七；涉及的交易總金額亦上升超過三成至約200億元。因此，我們未見到有需要改變繳付非住宅物業印花稅的安排。

（二）正如我早前介紹，政府一直促進外來投資和密切留意非住宅物業市場的情況和發展。

就問題中提及的幾個建議，我簡略回覆如下：

香港金融管理局現時並沒有就香港以外地區投資者的按揭供款比率及貸款比率實施限制。在考慮客戶的貸款申請時，每間銀行均會考慮一系列因素，包括銀行的業務策略、貸款用途、客戶信貸紀錄、還款能力等，以全面評估是否批出貸款和相關貸款的條款。銀行會否向申請人提供按揭貸款優惠（如現金回贈）是銀行的商業決定。

「新資本投資者入境計劃」現時容許申請人投資住宅和非住宅房地產，而獲計算入投資總額的上限為1,000萬港元，已經佔該計劃最低投資要求的三分之一。政府會持續檢視申請人的投資情況，並適時檢討相關安排。

政府已經在二○二三年二月底將徵收100元印花稅的物業價值上限由200萬元提高至300萬元，並調整其他印花稅稅階。在二○二五年二月底進一步將徵收100元印花稅的物業價值上限提高至400萬元。這些措施均有助降低部分住宅及非住宅物業交易的印花稅。我們現時沒有計劃為吸引外來投資而調整印花稅。

（三）現時非住宅物業的差餉是根據物業的應課差餉租值百分之五徵收，徵收率與應課差餉租值為550,000元或以下的住宅物業相同。估價署每年會就全港所有物業單位，包括非住宅物業，全面重新評估其應課差餉租值，以確保按最新的市場租金水平徵收差餉及地租。根據估價署的資料，私人寫字樓的租金指數，在二○一九年十月至二○二四年十月的五年間下跌約百分之十八。同期私人寫字樓的應課差餉租值下跌約百分之十六。以上數字顯示估價署的評估已適當地反映近年的市場租金變化，下調對非住宅物業徵收的差餉。再者，自二○二五年起實施的累進差餉制度，並不適用於非住宅物業，徵收率仍維持於百分之五。因此我們認為現時非住宅物業的差餉徵收率屬合理水平，而每年的應課差餉租值重估亦有效反映物業市場的最新情況。

多謝主席。"
LCQ3: Non-residential properties,2025-07-30 12:45,2025-07-30 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000372.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Doreen Kong and a reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

  There are views pointing out that the economic downturn in recent years has led to rising vacancy rates of non-residential properties (e.g. shops and offices), thus exerting heavy operational pressure on property owners. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will consider allowing owners of non-residential properties to pay the stamp duty on such property transactions by instalments, so as to alleviate their financial pressure;

(2) whether the Government will consider introducing policy incentives and initiatives, such as suitably relaxing the restrictions on investment in non-residential properties by foreign investors or applicants under the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme, lowering the stamp duty rates for non-residential properties, as well as providing financing incentives or streamlining the investment approval process, so as to attract international capital and enhance the level of transaction activity in the market; and

(3) given that some owners of non-residential properties have reflected that despite the downward adjustments in the rental values of the properties held by them in recent years, they still need to pay high rates and Government rent, whether the Government will draw reference from the practices in places such as the United Kingdom and Australia and consider introducing temporary rates concession measures for non-residential properties, so as to assist property owners in coping with the pressure of the economic downturn?

Reply:

President,

  Before responding to the Hon Doreen Kong's questions, I would first provide an overview of Hong Kong's latest economic situation and the market conditions of non-residential properties.

  Hong Kong's economy continues to grow steadily. Real gross domestic product rose by 2.5 per cent in the full year of 2024 and expanded by 3.1 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2025, picking up from the 2.5 per cent growth in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, according to the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD), the overall vacancy rates for private offices and private commercial premises stood at 16.3 per cent and 11.8 per cent respectively at the end of 2024, representing increases of 1.4 per cent and 1.5 per cent compared to 2023. This indicates that vacancy rates for non-residential properties are not solely determined by Hong Kong's overall economic performance. Other contributing factors include the supply of properties, operation and development situation of individual enterprises, shift in consumption patterns of local residents and tourists, etc. Besides, property owners would also consider various factors when deciding whether to lease out vacant properties, such as market trends, their asset management strategies and financial positions, rental level, etc.

  The Government has been closely monitoring the situation and developments in the non-residential property market. In light of the vacancy rate of offices in recent years and the relatively ample supply of non-residential properties in the next few years, the Government has not put up commercial sites for tender since 2023/24, so as to allow the market to absorb the existing supply. In addition, the Government has been actively attracting investments. For example, from January 2023 to June 2025, Invest Hong Kong assisted over 1 300 overseas and Mainland enterprises in setting up or expanding their businesses in Hong Kong, which helps stimulate demand in the local non-residential property market.

  My responses to the three questions raised by the Hon Kong are as follows:

(1) We currently have no plan to allow payment of stamp duty on non-residential property transactions by instalments, based on three primary considerations:

  First, the stamp duty for non-residential property transactions currently ranges from $100 to a maximum rate of 4.25 per cent, constituting only a very small portion of the transaction cost. The maximum rate only applies to a transaction with an amount or value of consideration exceeding about $21.74 million. As stamp duty is usually borne by buyers, we do not consider that its current payment arrangement would impose financial pressure on non-residential property owners.

  Second, according to the Stamp Duty Ordinance, the Collector of Stamp Revenue should stamp an instrument upon payment of stamp duty. In other words, the instruments cannot be stamped before payment of all instalments. Generally speaking, instruments that are not stamped cannot be received in evidence in civil proceedings, nor can they be registered at the Land Registry.

  Third, the volume of the non-residential property market has been relatively stable over the past year. According to the statistics of the Inland Revenue Department, the first quarter of 2025-26 recorded approximately 3 600 stamping applications for non-residential properties, representing a year-on-year increase by about 17 per cent. Total transaction value also increased by more than 30 per cent to about $20 billion. Therefore, we do not see a need to change the payment arrangement of stamp duty on non-residential properties.

(2) As I mentioned earlier, the Government has been promoting inward investment and closely monitoring the situation and developments in the non-residential property market.

  Regarding the suggestions mentioned in the question, I would briefly respond as follows:

  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority currently does not impose any restriction on the mortgage-to-income ratio nor loan-to-value ratio for investors outside Hong Kong. When considering loan applications, each bank takes into account a range of factors, including the bank's business strategy, the purpose of the loan, the customer's credit history and repayment ability, to comprehensively assess whether to approve the loan and its terms. Whether a bank offers mortgage loan incentives (such as cash rebates) to applicants is its commercial decision.

  Currently, the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme allows applicants to invest in both residential and non-residential properties. The amount that is counted towards the total capital investment is subject to a cap of HK$10 million, already representing one-third of the scheme's minimum investment requirement. The Government will continue to review the investment patterns of applicants and evaluate the arrangements as necessary.

  In end February 2023, the Government has raised the maximum value of properties chargeable to $100 stamp duty from $2 million to $3 million and adjusted other value bands of stamp duty. In end February 2025, the Government has further raised the maximum value of properties chargeable to $100 stamp duty to $4 million. These measures help reduce the stamp duty of some residential and non-residential property transactions. We currently have no plan to further adjust stamp duty to promote inward investments.

(3) Currently, rates for non-residential properties are charged at 5 per cent of the rateable values of the properties, which is the same as that for residential properties with rateable values of or below $550,000. The RVD conducts annual general revaluation for all properties, including non-residential properties, so as to ensure that the rateable values for charging rates and government rent are assessed based on the latest market rental level. According to the statistics of RVD, rental indices and rateable values of private offices decreased by about 18 per cent and 16 per cent respectively in the five years between October 2019 and October 2024. These figures show that the RVD's valuation has properly reflected the change in market rental level in recent years, which reduces the rates for non-residential properties. Furthermore, the progressive rating system implemented since 2025 does not apply to non-residential properties, with the rates percentage charge for which maintaining at 5 per cent. We therefore consider the current rates percentage charge for non-residential properties reasonable, and the annual revaluation of rateable values responsive to the latest market dynamics.

  Thank you, President."

Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases updates recommendations on use of meningococcal vaccines,2025-07-30 12:40,2025-07-30 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000369.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) said today (July 30) that the Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases (SCVPD) under the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the DH held a meeting earlier this week and updated the recommendations on the use of meningococcal vaccines in Hong Kong after reviewing the local epidemiology of invasive meningococcal disease, the latest recommendations of the WorldHealthOrganization(WHO) and overseas practices, and balancing the risks and benefits of meningococcal vaccination.

In light of the very low invasive meningococcal disease incidence in Hong Kong, introducing universal meningococcal vaccination into the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme is not recommended by the SCVPD from the public health perspective.

Based on the risk of infection, the SCVPD recommended the following individuals to receive meningococcal vaccinations as appropriate for personal protection.

  1. Travellers at higher risk of exposure, including:

Those travelling to sub-Saharan regions of Africa during the dry season (i.e. December to June) should consult their doctors to receive quadrivalent MenACWY vaccine;
Those travelling to Mecca in Saudi Arabia for Hajj and Umrah should receive quadrivalent MenACWY vaccine;
Those travelling to other areas with reported meningococcal disease epidemics or outbreaks should receive vaccine that aligns with the destination's prevalent serogroups;
Long-term travellers (such as those studying abroad) should receive meningococcal vaccination per the recommendations by the health authorities in the destination country;


Individuals with immunodeficiency (advanced HIV infection, terminal complement component deficiencies and asplenia); and
Laboratory workers who are routinely exposed to isolates of N. meningitidis.


Travellers should seek professional advice from doctors for meningococcal vaccination. Doctors will take into account their age, health conditions, and details of the journeys (including destination, duration and activities) when giving the vaccination advice. In addition, the aforementioned three categories of individuals with immunodeficiency and relevant laboratory workers should seek advice from doctors for meningococcal vaccination as appropriate based on their underlying medical conditions and the risk of occupational exposure respectively.

The SCVPD will continue to monitor the scientific evidence, local epidemiology and recommendations from the WHO and overseas authorities, to review the recommendations on the use of meningococcal vaccinations from a public health perspective as appropriate.

The recommendations of the SCVPD have been uploaded to the CHPwebsite."
立法會十九題：提振本地消費,2025-07-30 12:20,2025-07-30 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000324.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上李鎮強議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見指出，鑑於疫情過後市民的生活習慣和消費模式有所改變，政府應着力重振經濟，重新吸引消費人流，以刺激本地消費。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否考慮仿效內地的「購新補貼方案」，推出「港補」計劃，即個人消費者在購買手機、平板電腦等電子用品，以及電視、冷氣機等家電時，可獲一次性補貼，並就有關計劃設立特定使用條件（例如只限在本地實體店使用）；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）有何具體措施重振本地夜經濟，以吸引市民留港消費？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直與社會各界攜手同心，全力拼經濟、謀發展，積極把握國家和國際機遇，推動經濟穩步向前。本地生產總值連續10個季度保持增長，二○二五年全年增長預測維持在2%至3%。政府會繼續密切留意經濟情況，因時制宜推行措施以協助業界，同時亦鼓勵零售業界積極尋索新路徑，推陳出新，為消費者創造新體驗，從而開拓更多商機和增長點。

政府統計處的數據顯示，二○二五年五月零售業總銷貨價值的臨時估計為313億元，較去年同月上升2.4%，終止了連續14個月的跌勢，顯示零售業在整體經濟復蘇帶動下，正開始回復到增長的正軌。政府正積極推動旅遊業及盛事項目，今年上半年訪港旅客人次約2400萬，按年增長12%，預計全年旅客人次會達4900萬，加上本地就業收入上升和內地經濟持續穩步增長，將有助進一步提振消費氣氛及支持消費市道。

就問題的三個部分，經諮詢財政司司長私人辦公室、文化體育及旅遊局、財經事務及庫務局和民政及青年事務局後，現回覆如下：

（一）在評估應否推行涉及大量公帑的一次性補貼措施時，政府秉持審慎理財原則，亦須進行全面考量，包括當前社會經濟形勢、政府的財政狀況，以及政策措施的長遠可持續性，以確保公共資源運用得宜，並切實保障香港整體利益。與此同時，政府將繼續多管齊下提振整體經濟，並聚焦透過長遠經濟政策及其他措施，包括加快創科產業轉型、促進資產市場穩健發展等，增強經濟增長動力，持續提升市民收入，從而提振市場消費。

（二）「全港戲院日」和「10.1半價睇好戲」的電影票價優惠活動獲得社會和電影業界的非常正面評價，在進一步刺激觀眾進入電影院觀賞電影之餘，亦帶動周邊消費。政府將繼續透過不同的資助項目及活動拓展本地觀眾群，培養市民到電影院觀賞電影的習慣，務求協助香港電影業、電影院業穩健發展。

（三）政府於二○二三年九月中展開「香港夜繽紛」活動，聯同社會各界舉辦一系列具香港特色和吸引力的夜間活動，向市民和遊客展示香港晚上的活力和魅力。社會各界對「香港夜繽紛」反應正面，各項活動為香港市面營造熱鬧氣氛。

其後民政事務總署轄下18區民政事務處聯同各區區議會成立的「提振地區經濟專責工作小組」於二○二四年一月推出一系列「18區日夜都繽紛」活動，目的主要是通過為市民提供各式文娛消閒節目，展現各區多元化的地區特色面貌或傳統文化風韻，以帶動市面熱鬧氣氛。活動受市民歡迎，而商戶反應正面，表示活動人流暢旺，對推廣生意有一定幫助。

此外，政府和香港旅遊發展局會繼續聯同會議及展覽業界和其他相關組織，推動不同規模及類型的國際會展旅遊活動在港舉行，吸引更多高增值過夜旅客訪港，從而推動零售市道。例如，香港零售管理協會於今年七月至八月舉辦第三屆「香港開心購物節」，透過跨界別合作，為市民及旅客提供消費折扣及免費禮品等優惠，以吸引更多新客群，為零售業注入新動能。

政府會繼續積極籌劃不同大型活動以吸引遊客到訪香港，同時推動本地市民及旅客在港消費，帶旺社會消費氛圍，從而帶動整體經濟。"

Question:

 Certain perspectives highlight that in view of the changes in people's lifestyle habits and consumption patterns after the epidemic, the Government should focus its efforts on reviving the economy and attracting consumer traffic again to stimulate local consumption. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will consider, by following the Mainland's ""Plan for Subsidies for the Purchase of New Products"", launching a ""Hong Kong Subsidy Plan"", i.e. individual consumers will be given a one-‍off subsidy for purchasing electronic products such as mobile phones and tablets, as well as household electrical appliances such as televisions and air-‍conditioners, and drawing up specific conditions of use under the plan (e.g. confining the use of such subsidies to local physical stores); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it will consider supporting cinemas to offer movie ticket promotion for film shows on weekend evenings, so as to attract night-‍time consumption by young consumers, thereby driving the development of the relevant industries such as retail, catering and even transport services; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) of the specific measures in place to revive the local night economy, so as to attract members of the public to stay and spend in Hong Kong?

Reply:

President,

 The Government has been working closely with various sectors of the community to strive for economic growth and development, actively seizing national and international opportunities to drive the economy forward. The gross domestic product has grown for 10 consecutive quarters, and its growth forecast for 2025 as a whole is maintained at two per cent to three per cent. The Government will continue to closely monitor the economic situation, and implement measures to duly assist the business community, and at the same time, encourages the retail sector to actively explore new avenues, bring forth new and innovative ideas to create new experiences for consumers, with a view to developing more business opportunities and growth areas.

 The data of the Census and Statistics Department show that the value of total retail sales in May 2025 was $31.3 billion, representing an increase of 2.4 per cent as compared with the same period last year. This marks the end of a 14-month consecutive decline, showing that the retail sector is beginning to return to a growth trajectory alongside the recovery of the overall economy. The Government is actively promoting tourism and mega events. In the first half of this year, the number of visitor arrivals was about 24 million, representing a 12 per cent year-on-year increase. The number of visitor arrivals for the whole year is expected to reach 49 million, and together with the increase in employment earnings and sustained steady growth of the Mainland economy, it will help further bolster consumption sentiment and support the consumption market.

 Having consulted the Financial Secretary's Private Office, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, the reply to the three parts of the question is as follows:

(1) In assessing whether to implement one-off subsidy initiatives involving substantial public funds, the Government must adhere to the principle of prudent financial management and conduct a comprehensive evaluation. This includes considering the social and economic situation, the Government's fiscal situation, and the long-term sustainability of the policy measures to ensure the proper use of public resources and safeguard the overall interests of Hong Kong. At the same time, the Government will continue to take multi-pronged measures to stimulate the overall economy, with a focus on implementing long-term economic policies and other initiatives. These include transformation of the innovation and technology industry and promotion of the stable and healthy development of the assets market, etc., thereby strengthening economic growth momentum, enabling the sustained increase in incomes, and in turn boosting market consumption.

(2)Both the Cinema Day and the 1st October Movie Fiesta have received very positive feedbacks from the public and the film industry, as these initiatives of offering concessionary ticket prices provided additional incentive of watching films at cinemas and boosted consumption in surrounding shops. The Government will continue to fund projects and activities that build local audience, so as to cultivate the habit of cinema-going and support the steady development of Hong Kong films and cinema industries.

(3) The Government launched the ""Night Vibes Hong Kong"" campaign in mid-September 2023, where it joined hands with different sectors of the community to organise a wealth of attractive night-time events with local characteristics to showcase to the public and tourists the vibrancy and charm of nightlife in Hong Kong. The ""Night Vibes Hong Kong"" campaign was positively received by the community, with various activities of the campaign creating a dynamic vibe in Hong Kong.

 Subsequently, a series of activities of the ""Day x Night Vibes @ 18 Districts"" was launched in January 2024 by the 18 District Offices of the Home Affairs Department, in collaboration with the Working Group on Boosting Local Economy set up by the District Councils, with an aim to provide the public with a wide range of cultural and leisure events to showcase local diversity or traditional cultural connotations in various districts, so as to create a buoyant mood in the community. The activities have been well-received by the public, and the feedback received from stall operators has been predominantly positive, indicating high patronage and the activities' effectiveness in promoting their businesses.

 In addition, the Government and the Hong Kong Tourism Board, in collaboration with the convention and exhibition industry and relevant organisations, will continue to encourage the organisation of international meetings, travels, conventions and exhibitions events of different scales and types in Hong Kong, so as to help attract more high value-added overnight visitors to come to Hong Kong, thereby driving the retail market forward. For example, the Hong Kong Retail Management Association organises the third edition of the Hong Kong Shopping Festival from July to August this year to provide special offers such as shopping discounts and free gifts to the public and visitors through cross-sector co-operation, so as to attract more new clientele, with a view to injecting new momentum into the retail sector.

 The Government will continue to actively plan and organise various large-scale events to attract visitors to Hong Kong, and at the same time, promote local consumption by the local public and visitors, so as to bolster consumption sentiment in the community, thereby driving the overall economy."
LCQ2: Application of innovative technologies in law enforcement,2025-07-30 12:18,2025-07-30 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000346.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Chan Yuet-ming and a reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

 It is learnt that the application of innovative technologies is increasingly common in the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) of the Government, and various disciplined services are already equipped with different types of drones as well as mounted instrument systems to enhance work efficiency. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the current number of drones procured by each LEA and the costs involved; the number of operations executed by such drones and their scope of work in the current year, and whether various LEAs have formulated mechanisms to protect personal privacy in respect of the application of drones;

(2) whether it will study enhancing the application of drones in law enforcement, as well as expanding their inspection coverage and regularising their patrol arrangements, so as to combat crimes such as fly-tipping activities and burglaries in rural areas; and

(3) as it has been reported that the use of automated drones has been introduced under the Pilot Scheme for Operational Deployment of Drones of the Police to carry out border patrol work, but there are views that under poor lighting conditions at night, it is difficult for the pilots and observers operating the drones to effectively identify suspicious persons, whether the Police have plans to make use of advanced apparatus or artificial intelligence technologies to enhance the capability of drones to identify suspicious persons, so as to further enhance patrol efficiency?

Reply:

President,

 The Security Bureau has been actively encouraging and supporting the application of various innovative technologies in its disciplined services and auxiliary services to enhance service efficiency and quality. In particular, drone technology is gaining popularity and has become a major tool used worldwide in the areas of law enforcement and emergency response. The disciplined services and auxiliary services are using drone technology as appropriate through adopting different strategies and assessing the situation according to actual operational needs, in order to enhance service quality and operational efficiency.

 The reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) The disciplined services and auxiliary services are, having regard to various operational needs, equipped with drones of different sizes and related instrument systems to enhance operational efficiency, thereby better utilising manpower resources. The number of drones purchased, the relevant expenditure and the number of tasks performed by drones in respective disciplined services and auxiliary services as of June 30, 2025 are set out in the Annex.

 As regards the scope of tasks, the use of drone technology is increasingly common in the disciplined services/auxiliary services. Examples include:

1. Crime detection and investigation: Drones are used in operations conducted by the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department and the Immigration Department (ImmD). Equipped with high-resolution cameras for video recording at crime scenes, especially in the countryside and at the sea where access by persons are relatively difficult, the drones are capable of assisting in investigation and evidence collection;

2. Beat patrolling and crime prevention: The HKPF officially launched the Pilot Scheme for ""Operational Deployment of Drones"" in May this year. Drones are used to perform patrols in the Border District and Kowloon West Region. In the Border District, the HKPF deployed an automated drone docking system which utilises smart planning of flight paths to enable automatic patrol operations. With drones conducting patrols within pre-defined zones, efficiency of border patrol is enhanced and police deployment has become more flexible. As for Kowloon West Region, through flexible deployment of drones for high-altitude patrols, the patrol coverage is expanded and operational efficiency is enhanced. It also boosts rapid response capabilities and optimises resource allocation of the Police;

 Since the launch of the Pilot Scheme in May, the use of drones has assisted the Police in detecting four cases so far, with three persons arrested. The HKPF will review the implementation progress of the Pilot Scheme as well as its effectiveness. In parallel, the HKPF will study the enhancement of the Pilot Scheme and will further expand its coverage to Cheung Chau Division and the Central District, which is scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year;

3. Maintaining of public safety and public order; management of crowds and traffic: Drones are used by the HKPF to monitor crowd and traffic flow in largeâscale events. Through real-time images, potential safety hazards are promptly identified. The HKPF introduced a drone system capable of hovering at designated locations for an extended period of time for illumination and broadcasting, sending safety reminders to members of the public;

4. Rescue operations: The HKPF, the Fire Services Department (FSD) and the Civil Aid Service use drones to surmount harsh conditions and quickly reach scenes like cliffs and mountains to assist in the search for missing persons. Throughout the rescue process, drones can conduct surveillance to ensure safety at the site. In addition, in major and special incidents where the scenes are complicated, drones can take high-definition photographs of collapsed and deformed debris for the production of three-dimensional models, thereby facilitating the assessment and planning of rescue operations by ground rescue personnel. If necessary, the airdrop system installed at the drones can be used to drop necessities to stranded persons;

5. Firefighting: The FSD uses drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras to monitor temperature changes at the fire scene from multiple angles in the air. Based on such data, incident commanders can work out firefighting strategies and devise entry and evacuation routes to enhance the efficiency of firefighting and rescue operations and ensure the safety of rescue workers; and

6. Management of prisons and detention facilities: To further strengthen the security of these facilities, drone technology is employed by the Correctional Services Department and the ImmD to assist in the inspection of security facilities, for example, examining the deteriorating conditions of boundary fencing and checking roof-tops of buildings for anomalous objects, as well as assisting in taking swift emergency response actions.

 While applying drone technology, the disciplined services and auxiliary services will exercise stringent control and supervision in the course of performing their duties to ensure that the operation of the drones is safe and complies with the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, so as to protect the privacy of the public. The disciplined services and auxiliary services will strictly comply with the Guidance on CCTV Surveillance and Use of Drones issued by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data. For example, internal guidelines are formulated to regulate flight missions of the disciplined services and auxiliary services, video footage collected are handled properly, and flight paths are carefully planned to avoid unnecessary proximity to the public and residential areas.

(2) In addition to the Pilot Scheme for ""Operational Deployment of Drones"" mentioned above, the HKPF is currently using drones in other specific operations, including anti-burglary patrols in rural areas to see if there are suspicious persons lingering or hiding. Other illegal activities, such as fly-tipping, that are detected during the patrols will be referred to relevant departments for follow-up actions.

(3) The drones being used by the HKPF is equipped with various functions, including artificial intelligence technology. They are also fitted with thermal imaging cameras and night vision cameras to provide efficient and effective technological support for the detection of different types of crime during night time when lighting is inadequate.

 As drone technology matures, drones have become more versatile in terms of their functions. The disciplined services and auxiliary services will consistently observe innovative technology development while reviewing the application of various technologies, including the effectiveness of the use of drones. Meanwhile, the disciplined services and auxiliary services will examine ways to further enhance their service quality and operational efficiency through the use of advanced technologies."

隨着無人機技術日益成熟，無人機的功能亦變得多元化。各紀律部隊及輔助部隊會繼續密切留意創新科技發展，檢視目前各項科技的應用，包括無人機應用的成效，探討如何運用先進科技進一步提升部隊的服務質素和工作效率。"
LCQ1: Labour Importation Scheme for Transport Sector,2025-07-30 12:11,2025-07-30 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000325.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Lam So-wai and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

The Government launched two rounds of the Labour Importation Scheme for the Transport Sector - Public Light Bus (PLB)/Coach Trade (the Scheme) in 2023 and last year respectively, to allow PLB and coach trades to suitably import drivers. However, there are views pointing out that imported drivers may affect road safety due to their differences in driving culture, habits, and language. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of workers to date who have come to Hong Kong through the second round of applications under the Scheme and those who have commenced their driving work after obtaining the relevant driving licence and completing the route training; whether it has compiled statistics on the driving test passing rate and retest rate of imported drivers under the Scheme, and the traffic accident rate after commencing their driving work, with a breakdown by the type of vehicle they operate (i.e. PLB, coach, and cross-boundary bus);

(2) how it will ensure that imported drivers under the Scheme are adequately trained to avoid a high proportion of imported drivers failing the driving tests and requiring retakes, as well as the occurrence of a high traffic accident rate; and

(3) given that some members of the cross-boundary bus industry have pointed out that there is still a shortage of drivers at present, whether consideration will be given to increasing the quotas or launching the third round of applications under the Scheme?

Reply:

President,

The Government has all along been concerned about the persistent shortage of drivers in the public light bus (PLB) and coach trades. In June 2023, the Government announced the Labour Importation Scheme for the Transport Sector – PLB/Coach Trade (the Scheme), which can reasonably address the manpower shortage problem in the relevant trades, while safeguarding the employment opportunities of the local workforce.

Our reply to the question raised by the Hon Lam So-wai is as follows:

(1) and (2) The total number of quotas for imported drivers under the Scheme is 1 700. All quotas have been allocated through two rounds of applications in September 2023 and July 2024 respectively. Among the 849 quotas approved in the second round of applications, as of the end of last month (i.e. June 2025), a total of 716 imported drivers, including 422 PLB drivers, 167 local coach drivers and 127 cross-boundary coach (CBC) drivers, have been arranged by their employers to complete the relevant training and assessment, including obtaining the relevant driving licenses, and have commenced services after completing the route training.

We attach great importance to the driving skills and performance of imported drivers. Upon approval of the quota for imported drivers, employers are required to arrange the drivers to come to Hong Kong in a timely manner to undergo training for the relevant driving tests. Under the existing mechanism, imported drivers are required to pass and comply with the same driving test arrangements and standards as those for local drivers to ensure road safety. As of the end of last month, the passing rates of local driving tests for imported PLB drivers, local coach drivers and CBC drivers have remained stable at 43 per cent, 43 per cent and 55 per cent respectively. In comparison, these figures are better than the passing rates of local drivers for PLB and public bus driving tests in 2024, which are 15 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. In addition, as of the end of last month, the percentages of imported PLB drivers, local coach drivers and CBC drivers who had to retake the driving test to pass are 63 per cent, 54 per cent and 42 per cent respectively.

After passing the driving tests, imported drivers are required by law to attend the PLB or public bus pre-service course. The courses aim to enhance the awareness of new drivers on driving safety and driving attitude, and equip them with basic knowledge of passenger service and skills in customer service, etc. Imported drivers must complete the pre-service course and pass the course examination. The Transport Department (TD) will then issue the full driving licence to the imported drivers. Before commencement of driving services, the employers will also arrange route training for the imported drivers, so to enable the drivers to familiarise themselves with the driving and passenger pick-up arrangement of the assigned route.

Since the introduction of the Scheme, the TD has been actively following up and co-ordinating with the operators, including enhancing the driving test arrangements and reminding them of the need to arrange adequate driving test training for the imported drivers. As the Scheme progresses, employers have gained a thorough understanding of the procedures and processes of importing drivers, as well as the arrangements of the driving tests. They are generally able to arrange for imported drivers to complete the test and training as early as practicable, so as to provide safe services to the public.

Same as local PLB/coach drivers, operators are required to closely monitor the daily performance of imported drivers. The TD will also monitor the services provided by the operators on a regular basis and conduct on-site inspections to understand the performance of drivers (including imported drivers) as necessary. According to our observation and feedback from employers, imported drivers are generally experienced drivers with adequate traffic knowledge. They are able to handle the road conditions in Hong Kong, delivering steady and high-quality services. At present, the TD requires the operators to submit investigation reports on accidents involving PLB and coach, and will take appropriate follow-up actions against the operators based on the investigation outcome. According to the number of traffic accidents reported by operators to the Police, during the 16-month period from January last year to end April this year, there were a total of 1 115 traffic accidents involving PLBs and 554 traffic accidents involving coaches. Among these, 111 involved imported PLB drivers and 18 involved imported coach drivers, which account for less than 10 per cent and about 3 per cent of the total traffic accidents respectively.

(3) Overall, the implementation of the Scheme has been generally smooth. The imported drivers can effectively alleviate the acute manpower shortage in the trades, enhance service standards and provide quality and stable services to the public. In our observation, some green minibus routes have shown a significant improvement in service frequencies and reduction in the number of complaints after introducing imported drivers.

With the aging of drivers in the PLB and coach trade, the quotas for imported labour under the Scheme can only meet about half of the manpower gap, and cannot fully resolve the long-term labour shortage problem faced by the trades. At the same time, with the recovery of the number of visitors and more frequent exchanges between Hong Kong and the Mainland, we notice that there is a growing demand from citizens and visitors for public transportation, particularly for local coach and CBC services, which poses challenges for the manpower situation of the trade. The Government will continue to closely monitor changes in the local labour market and the manpower situation, and will continue to review the implementation of the Scheme and assess the manpower needs of the trades. At the same time, we will maintain close communication with various stakeholders and enhance information dissemination through the stakeholder consultative group, and review the Scheme in good time.

Thank you, President."
​立法會一題：運輸業輸入勞工計劃,2025-07-30 12:10,2025-07-30 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000323.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上林素蔚議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

政府分別於二○二三年及去年推出兩輪運輸業輸入勞工計劃──公共小巴／客車行業（該計劃），適度容許公共小巴及客車行業輸入司機。然而有意見指出，外勞司機在駕駛文化、習慣和言語上的差異或會影響行車安全。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）至今分別有多少名勞工透過該計劃的第二輪申請抵港，以及在取得相關駕駛執照及完成路線培訓後投入駕駛工作；有否統計，該計劃的外勞司機的駕駛考試及格率及重考率，以及投入駕駛工作後的交通意外比率，並按其所駕駛的車輛類型（即公共小巴、客車及跨境直通巴士）列出分項數字；

（二）如何確保該計劃的外勞司機獲得充足培訓，以避免大比例外勞司機駕駛考試不及格而須重考，以及出現交通意外率偏高的情況；及

（三）鑑於有跨境巴士業界人士指出，現時司機人手仍然短缺，當局會否考慮增加該計劃配額及推出第三輪申請？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直關注公共小巴及客車行業持續面對的司機短缺問題，並於二○二三年六月公布運輸業輸入勞工計劃──公共小巴／客車行業（計劃），既可合理應對有關行業的人手短缺問題，也同時保障本地勞動人口的就業機會。

就林素蔚議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）及（二）在計劃下可輸入司機的配額總數為1 700個，政府分別在二○二三年九月及二○二四年七月透過兩輪申請，悉數批出所有配額。在第二輪申請獲批的849個配額中，截至上月即二○二五年六月底，共有716名輸入司機已獲僱主安排完成相關培訓和考核，包括考取相關駕駛執照，並在完成相關路線的訓練後投入服務，當中包括422名公共小巴司機、167名本地客車司機和127名跨境巴士司機。

我們十分重視輸入司機的駕駛技能及工作表現。在獲批輸入司機配額後，僱主須適時安排司機來港，進行相關車輛的駕駛考試訓練。按現時機制，輸入司機須通過及遵從與本地司機相同的相關駕駛考試安排及標準，以保障道路安全。截至上月底，輸入公共小巴司機、本地客車司機及跨境巴士司機的本地駕駛考試及格率保持平穩，分別為43%、43%和55%，優於本地司機在二○二四年公共小巴和公共巴士的考試及格率，即分別為15%和30%。另外，截至上月底，輸入的公共小巴司機、本地客車司機及跨境巴士司機須重考才通過駕駛考試的比率分別為63%、54%和42%。

通過駕駛考試後，輸入司機必須按法例要求，修習公共小巴或公共巴士職前課程。課程旨在提高新入職司機的駕駛安全和態度，及讓他們掌握載客服務的基本知識和顧客服務技巧等。輸入司機必須完成職前課程並通過課程考試，運輸署才會向司機發出正式駕駛執照。僱主亦會在輸入司機投入服務前提供路線培訓，好讓他們熟習指定路線服務的行車及接載乘客的相關運作安排。

運輸署在計劃推出後，一直積極跟進和協調，包括優化駕駛考試安排及提醒營辦商需要為輸入司機安排足夠駕駛考試訓練。隨着計劃推展，僱主對輸入司機的手續、程序和駕駛考試的安排現已有充分掌握，大致能夠安排輸入司機早日完成考試和培訓，為市民提供安全的服務。

與本地公共小巴／客車司機一樣，營辦商須密切監督輸入司機的日常工作表現。運輸署亦會恆常地監察營辦商的服務，並會按需要實地視察了解司機（包括輸入司機）的表現。據我們觀察和僱主的回饋，輸入司機普遍駕駛經驗豐富，擁有充足交通知識，能夠應對本港的路面情況，提供穩健及高水平的服務。現時，運輸署有要求營辦商就涉及公共小巴或客車的交通意外提交調查報告，並會按調查結果向營辦商採取合適的跟進行動。根據營辦商向警方報案的交通意外數字，在去年一月至今年四月底的16個月內，分別共有1 115宗涉及小巴及554宗涉及客車的交通意外，當中111宗涉及輸入小巴司機及18宗涉及輸入客車司機，分別佔比低於10%和約3%。

（三）整體而言，計劃的實施過程大致暢順，輸入司機能有效紓緩行業人手嚴重短缺的問題，有助業界提升服務水平，為市民提供優質及穩定的服務。我們觀察到部分專線小巴路線在引入輸入司機後，其服務班次有明顯改善，而投訴數字亦有所減少。

基於公共小巴及客車行業司機日益高齡化，計劃下的輸入勞工的配額只能應付行業約一半的人力資源缺口，未能完全解決業界面對長期人手不足的問題。與此同時，隨着旅客數字回穩，以及香港和內地的聯繫愈趨緊密，我們留意到市民和旅客對公共交通，特別是本地客車和跨境巴士服務的需求也有所上升，對業界人手情況持續構成挑戰。政府會繼續密切留意本地勞工市場及人力情況的變化，並持續檢視計劃的實施情況及評估行業的人手需求，同時亦會透過諮詢小組與各持份者保持緊密溝通及加強發放資訊，適時檢討計劃。

多謝主席。"

問題：

根據警方的《交通報告二零二四年》，近年交通意外宗數持續上升，由二○二二年的15 107宗上升至去年的18 354宗，升幅達21.5%。同時，被運輸署定義為交通黑點（交通黑點）的路段由二○二二年第一季的29個，增加至去年第四季的57個。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年發生在交通黑點的交通意外總宗數，以及佔該年整體交通意外總宗數的比率分別為何；

（二）當局有否就全港各個交通黑點進行研究或實地評估，以分析其形成的成因（例如是否與該等路段的道路設計、交通流量或行人活動有關）；如有，研究結果和改善道路設施的計劃分別為何；長遠而言，當局有否計劃全面檢討全港道路的設計，或引入智能交通系統（如利用人工智能監測車速及實時調節交通燈號）以加強監察，從而進一步減少交通黑點數目；

（三）過去五年，每年有多少個正在進行或已經完工的交通黑點改善工程項目（包括但不限於指示牌及改善交通設施等）；有否評估有關項目的執行成效（包括在改善工程完成後，在該等路段發生的交通意外數字及所涉傷亡人數）為何；

（四）鑑於運輸署會在交通黑點設置「前面有交通意外黑點」標誌，讓道路使用者（包括駕駛者及行人）更易辨識交通黑點的位置，而據報運輸署過往亦曾在多次發生嚴重交通意外的路段（例如跑馬地摩利臣山道和體育路交界的路口）加設告示牌和減速地面標示，但其交通事故頻生的問題仍未解決，就已採取交通改善措施但交通事故仍頻生的路段，當局未來有何措施和計劃，包括會否與警方協調並加強執法，以盡量減低該等道路發生交通意外的風險；及

（五）有否參考其他國家和地區的做法或研究其他可行措施，以進一步加強道路使用者在途經交通黑點時的警覺性和危機意識？

答覆：

主席：

就何敬康議員有關在交通黑點發生的交通意外及道路安全改善措施的提問，經諮詢運輸署後，我現回覆如下：

（一）二○二○年至二○二四年於交通黑點發生的交通意外宗數，及其佔該年度整體交通意外宗數的比率表列如下。二○二○年至二○二二年的數字或受新冠疫情因素影響，而二○二三年至二○二四年交通意外宗數有所上升，主要是由於輕微交通意外宗數增加。

整體而言，大多數交通意外涉及駕駛者因素，例如不專注地駕駛、行車時太貼近前面的車輛及不小心轉換行車線。就此，運輸署會繼續聯同香港警務處與道路安全議會透過宣傳教育及加強執法提升駕駛者的道路安全意識。而運輸署亦一直聚焦分析交通黑點和其他交通意外比較頻繁的地點的意外數據，詳細研究是否有明顯的意外模式以至意外的共同成因，並制定針對性的改善措施。

此外，政府亦按研究所得、科技發展和其他地區的經驗，檢視法例。我們去年向立法會提交多項提升道路安全的法例修訂，包括規定電動車安裝車輛聲響警報系統、規定有可延伸架空結構的車輛安裝過高警示系統，以及規定私家車的兒童乘客使用兒童束縛設備，這些措施有助加強保障道路使用者的安全。此外，我們最近向立法會建議上調《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》與道路安全和交通擠塞有關的其中十九項罪行（包括超速駕駛、沒有遵從交通標誌和道路標記、橫過連續雙白線、駕駛時使用流動電話等）的定額罰款，以加強罰則的阻嚇作用。

運輸署也針對特定情況作出道路改善和交通管理優化措施，例如調整交通燈號、加建中央分隔欄、改善行人過路設施、優化交通標誌及道路標記等。就提問中指出的跑馬地摩理臣山道和體育道路口，運輸署在過去數年實施多項交通改善措施，當中包括增設「15米前停車」及「小心右面車輛」的交通標誌、增設「慢駛」及影線道路標記，把行車道局部收窄，以及增設黃色減速道路標記，以進一步提醒駕駛人士減速。此外，運輸署已在本年六月底重新整理路口前的交通標誌，並增設紅底白字「停車及讓路」的警告標誌，以更明確提示駕駛人士在路口前必須停車及讓路。運輸署現已安排以臨時水馬適度收窄前往皇后大道東及香港仔隧道之行車道，以期減低車輛在路口前的行駛速度，並會繼續檢視路口的交通情況，及考慮其他可行的交通改善措施及評估交通影響。

就斑馬線過路處方面，運輸署正更換全港有關的傳統黃波燈，使斑馬線過路處更顯眼及安全，同時配合宣傳、教育和執法活動，提醒駕駛者須停車讓行人先行。此外，實時交通燈號調節系統有助改善行人過路環境及道路安全。運輸署正逐步把系統推展至全港約50個合適的獨立燈控路口，將在二○二六年開始陸續裝設；另外，運輸署已完成在東涌市中心八個聯動式燈號控制路口實時交通燈號調節系統的試驗，並正安排在其他交通流量較高的聯動式路口試點安裝和收集狀況不同的路口的數據，以便制定長遠計劃。運輸署和香港警務處也會繼續善用新科技完善交通管理，提升道路安全。

（三）二○二○年至二○二四年期間，運輸署為約70個交通黑點和其他交通意外比較頻繁的地點實施道路設施改善工程，現時其中超過50個地點的改善工程已經完成，當中30個地點於改善工程完成後一年的整體交通意外宗數及傷亡人數，較工程完成前一年分別下降約24%及30%，而其餘20多個地點的改善工程完工未足一年，運輸署正收集更多數據以作分析。

（五）與其他國家和地區的做法相似，運輸署會因應個別交通黑點和其他交通意外比較集中的地點的具體情況，實施有助提高駕駛者警覺性的措施，包括設置合適的交通標誌及／或道路標記，例如「前面有行人過路處」、「交通燈號在前」、「開始減速」、「道路急轉」、「前面有向下斜坡」、「慢駛」等，讓駕駛者具體地掌握前方道路的環境，提前準備應對，減低意外發生的風險。而如上文所述，在整體層面，我們也會優化全港性的道路設施，善用新科技，並適時檢視法例，以締造更安全的道路環境，減少意外。"
LCQ13: Enhancing traffic safety,2025-07-30 12:02,2025-07-30 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000192.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Adrian Hoand a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

According to the Police's Traffic Report 2024, the number of traffic accidents has been on the increase in recent years, from 15 107 in 2022 to 18 354 last year, with a rate of increase as high as 21.5 per cent. At the same time, the number of road sections defined by the Transport Department (TD) as traffic black spots had increased from 29 in the first quarter of 2022 to 57 in the fourth quarter of last year. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the total number of traffic accidents which occurred at the traffic black spots in each of the past five years, and its respective percentage in the total number of traffic accidents in that year;

(2) whether the authorities have conducted studies or on-site assessments on various traffic black spots across the territory to analyse the cause of their formation (e.g. whether it is related to the road design, traffic flow capacity or pedestrian activities at such road sections); if so, of the respective findings of the studies and plans to improve the road facilities; whether the authorities have plans to conduct a comprehensive review of the design of roads across the territory, or introduce a smart traffic system (such as using artificial intelligence to monitor vehicle speed and making real-time adaptation to traffic signals) so as to enhance monitoring, thereby further reducing the number of traffic black spots in the long run;

(3) of the number of road improvement projects for traffic black spots in progress or completed (including but not limited to signages and improvement of transport facilities, etc) in each of the past five years; whether it has assessed the effectiveness of the implementation of the projects concerned (including the numbers of traffic accidents which occurred at such road sections and the resultant casualties upon completion of the improvement works);

(4) given that the TD will install the ""Traffic accident blackspot ahead"" signs at traffic black spots to enable road users (including motorists and pedestrians) to identify the locations of traffic black spots more easily, and it has been reported that the TD had in the past put up notices and provided road markings of speed reduction at road sections at which serious traffic accidents had repeatedly occurred (e.g. the junction of Morrison Hill Road and Sports Road in Happy Valley), but the problem of frequent traffic accidents has not yet been resolved; with respect to road sections where traffic accidents still occurred frequently despite the taking of traffic improvement measures, of the measures and plans to be implemented by the authorities in the future, including whether it will co-ordinate with the Police and step up law enforcement, so as to minimise the risk of traffic accidents occurring on such roads; and

(5) whether it has drawn on the practices of other countries and regions or explored other feasible measures to further enhance the alertness and crisis awareness of road users when passing through traffic black spots?

Reply:

President,

After consulting the Transport Department (TD), my response to the questions raised by the Hon Adrian Ho regarding traffic accidents and measures to improve road safety at traffic accident black spots is as follows:

(1) The number of traffic accidents that occurred at black spots between 2020 and 2024, along with their proportion of the total annual traffic accidents, is shown in the table below. The figures for 2020 to 2022 may have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The rise in traffic accidents in 2023 and 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of minor accidents.




Year
Numbers of traffic accidents occurred at black spots
Proportion to the total number of traffic accidents in that year


2020
448
2.9%


2021
355
2.0%


2022
479
3.2%


2023
729
4.2%


2024
649
3.5%




(2) and (4) The Government has adopted a multi-pronged approach to enhance road safety and reduce traffic accidents at the source. Key initiatives include investigating and analysing the causes of traffic accidents at black spots, formulating targeted improvement measures, reviewing legislation to strengthen driving safety requirements and increase the deterrent effect of penalties, improving road design and traffic management, incorporating technology to enhance traffic oversight, and stepping up publicity, education, and law enforcement.

In general, most traffic accidents are attributed to driver-related factors such as inattentive driving, tailgating, and careless lane changes. To address these issues, the TD will continue to collaborate with the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Road Safety Council to raise drivers' awareness through education campaigns and stricter enforcement. The TD is also focused on analysing accident data from black spots and other high-risk locations to identify common patterns and causes, enabling the formulation of targeted improvement measures.

In addition, the Government has reviewed existing legislation in light of research findings, technological advancements, and practices from other regions. In 2024, several legislative amendments were submitted to the Legislative Council to strengthen road safety, including requirements for electric vehicles to be equipped with an acoustic vehicle alerting system, for vehicles with extendable aerial structures to have an over-height warning system, and for child passengers in private cars to use child restraining devices. These measures further protect road users. Furthermore, the Government has proposed to increase fixed penalties for 19 traffic offences under the Fixed Penalty (Criminal Proceedings) Ordinance, such as speeding, failure to comply with traffic signs and markings, crossing double white lines, and using mobile phones while driving, to enhance their deterrent effect.

The TD has also implemented traffic management and road improvement measures tailored to specific situations. These include adjusting traffic signals, adding central dividers, improving pedestrian facilities, and optimising signage and road markings. At the junction of Morrison Hill Road and Sports Road in Happy Valley, mentioned in the enquiry, the TD has introduced several traffic improvements over recent years. These include new signs reading ""Stop 15 metres ahead"" and ""Beware of vehicles from the right,"" lane-narrowing hatched markings and ""Slow down"" indicators, and yellow speed-reduction road markings. In late June 2025, the TD rearranged signs at the junction and added a ""Stop and give way"" warning sign with white letters on a red background to clearly signal the need to yield. Temporary water-filled barriers were also placed along lanes leading to Queen's Road East and Aberdeen Tunnel to encourage speed reduction. The TD will continue to monitor the junction's conditions, evaluate traffic impact, and consider further feasible improvements.

Regarding zebra crossings, the TD is replacing traditional Belisha beacons across Hong Kong to make crossings more visible and safer. These efforts are complemented by education and enforcement activities reminding drivers to stop for pedestrians. Additionally, the Real-time Adaptive Traffic Signal System is improving the pedestrian environment and road safety. The system is being expanded to approximately 50 independent signalised junctions starting in 2026. After a successful trial across eight linked signalised junctions in Tung Chung Town Centre, pilot installations will continue at other busy junctions. Data collected will help inform long-term strategies. The TD and the HKPF will also continue to leverage new technologies to improve traffic management and enhance road safety.

(3) Between 2020 and 2024, the TD carried out road improvement works at approximately 70 traffic accident black spots and other locations with a relatively high frequency of accidents. As of now, improvement works have been completed at over 50 of these sites. Among them, 30 locations recorded a reduction in overall traffic accidents and casualties by approximately 24 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, within one year following the completion of the works, compared to the year prior. For the remaining 20-plus locations, improvement works were completed less than a year ago, and the TD is currently gathering further data for analysis.

(5) In line with practices adopted by other countries and regions, the TD will implement measures to enhance driver awareness based on the specific conditions of individual traffic accident black spots and other areas with a higher concentration of accidents. These measures include installing appropriate traffic signs and road markings, such as ""Pedestrian crossing ahead"", ""Traffic signals ahead"", ""Reduce speed now"", ""Sharp deviation"", ""Steep hill downwards ahead"", and ""Slow down"", to provide drivers with a clearer understanding of the road conditions ahead and help them prepare accordingly to reduce accident risks. As mentioned above, we will continue to upgrade road infrastructure throughout Hong Kong, leverage new technologies, and conduct timely legislative reviews from a comprehensive standpoint to foster a safer road environment and reduce traffic accidents."
立法會二十二題：人事登記服務的安排,2025-07-30 12:00,2025-07-30 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000267.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上陳克勤議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

主席：

就陳克勤議員的提問，經諮詢商務及經濟發展局和財經事務及庫務局後，現回覆如下：

（一）由二○二三年至今年六月三十日，入境事務處（入境處）各人事登記辦事處（人事登記處）的使用人次表列如下︰

@使用人次反映各辦事處的申請、領證及查詢數字（經四捨五入至最接近千位數）。二○二三年的使用人次因香港與內地恢復通關等因素而顯著較高。
^四間人事登記處的延長服務時間由二○二三年三月六日開始，至二○二四年十二月三十一日結束。
*觀塘辦事處於二○二四年六月十一日搬遷至將軍澳新總部，並重新命名為將軍澳辦事處。
#觀塘（臨時）辦事處於二○二三年十一月一日投入服務。

由於營運各人事登記處是入境處日常工作的一部分，入境處沒有就各人事登記處的營運開支作分項計算。在最近三個財政年度，人事登記處所涉及的薪金開支表列如下︰

註︰包括公務員及合約員工的薪金開支。除營運六間常設人事登記處外，因市民對身份證及其他身份證服務需求在疫情後大幅上升，入境處透過內部調配人手，於二○二三年三月六日至二○二四年十二月三十一日延長四間人事登記處的服務時段及於二○二三年十一月一日起增設觀塘（臨時）辦事處，以提升人事登記處的整體處理能力。入境處透過靈活調配人手應付對身份證服務的需求，並沒有就各人事登記處所涉及的薪金開支作分項計算。

（二）為提供更多會展設施以進一步促進香港會展業的長遠發展，政府正按計劃推展香港會議展覽中心附近的灣仔北重建項目，包括將灣仔北三座政府大樓、告士打道花園及港灣消防局用地重建為會展設施、酒店和寫字樓。

入境處總部已於二○二四年六月由灣仔入境事務大樓遷往將軍澳。位於灣仔入境事務大樓的人事登記處—港島辦事處（人事登記港島辦事處）目前仍在原址為市民提供服務。為配合灣仔北重建計劃，入境處正為人事登記港島辦事處在區內物色合適的辦公室，以重置該辦事處。該辦事處的重置時間及地點，須視乎實際情況，包括灣仔北重建計劃的進度、辦事處的運作需要和服務需求。待人事登記港島辦事處搬遷計劃的細節落實後，入境處會適時作出公布。

（三）及（四）入境處在重置人事登記港島辦事處時，會考慮交通暢達性、公眾服務需求及辦事處運作需要等準則，確保選址便利市民。入境處並會持續檢視其辦事處的服務安排和運作，研究將目前分散於不同地點的入境處辦公室和設施整合的可行性，為市民提供更便捷和優質的服務。

（五）為配合「智慧政府」的發展，入境處一直善用科技提升服務效率，包括透過設於各區辦事處的不同自助服務站，為特定個人證件服務提供自助申請和領證的選項。

入境處於去年十二月提升「申請個人證件服務站」的功能，推出自助申請香港身份證服務，讓合資格的申請人可以全自助形式辦理登記身份證的手續，以及透過服務站一站式辦理身份證和香港特別行政區護照申請。市民無需預約，便可於具有身份認證、拍攝照片、資料輸入及電子付款功能的自助服務站辦理個人證件申請。至於領證方面，「領取個人證件服務站」則整合了現有領取證件服務站的各種功能，合資格的市民可以一站式自助領取個人證件。

目前，位於將軍澳的入境處總部共設置了54部全新的自助服務站，包括44部「申請個人證件服務站」及10部「領取個人證件服務站」。全新的自助服務站自推出以來運作暢順，亦廣受市民歡迎。入境處會考慮於重置後的人事登記港島辦事處加設全新的自助服務站，並在辦公時間以外開放，以更切合市民的不同需要，進一步提升服務質素。"

Question:

It has been reported that the Registration of Persons - Hong Kong Office (Hong Kong Office) of the Immigration Department (ImmD), which is located on the 8th floor of the Immigration Tower in Wan Chai, is expected to relocate within 2026. Regarding the arrangements for registration of persons (ROP) services, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the usage figures and expenditures of each ROP office in the past three years;

(2) of the relocation details (including the timetable) of the Hong Kong Office;

(3) of the criteria adopted by the Government for determining the new location of the Hong Kong Office, e.g. whether it will consider facilitating members of the public to renew their Mainland Travel Permits for Hong Kong and Macao Residents concurrently, or relocating the office to the area of Wan Chai District or the Central and Western District in the vicinity of the original location; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) given that apart from the Hong Kong Office, the ImmD currently also operates the Hong Kong Island Travel Documents Issuing Office in the Harbour Building in Central, as well as the Births and Deaths General Register Office and the Marriage Registration and Records Office in the Queensway Government Offices respectively, and as the Queensway Government Offices have been reserved for the expansion of the High Court, whether the authorities have plans to consolidate the offices in the aforesaid three locations into one integrated office, so as to optimise the use of resources and achieve synergy; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) in order to facilitate members of the public to use self-service kiosks to apply for or collect documents outside office hours, whether the Hong Kong Office will set up Personal Documentation Submission Kiosks after its relocation, so as to provide automated services for the applications for identity cards and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passports; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, a reply to the questions raised by the Hon Chan Hak-kan is as follows:

(1) The usage statistics of each Registration of Persons (ROP) Office under the Immigration Department (ImmD) from 2023 to June 30, 2025 are tabulated below:

@The usage statistics reflect the number of applications, document collections and enquiries at each office (rounded to the nearest thousand). In 2023, usage was significantly higher due to factors including resumption of normal travel between Hong Kong and the Mainland.
^The extended service hours of the four ROP Offices began on March 6, 2023 and ended on December 31, 2024.
*The ROP - Kwun Tong Office was relocated to the new headquarters in Tseung Kwan O on June 11, 2024, and renamed as the ROP - Tseung Kwan O Office.
#The ROP - Kwun Tong (Temporary) Office commenced operations on November 1, 2023.

As operating ROP Offices is part of the regular duties of the ImmD, the ImmD does not maintain a separate breakdown of the operation expenses for each ROP Office. The salaries expenses related to ROP Offices in the past three financial years are tabulated below:




Year
Salaries expenses ($100 million) (Note)


2023-24
2.04


2024-25
2.16


2025-26 (April - June)
0.37




Note: Including salaries expenses of civil servants and contract staff. Apart from operating the six regular ROP Offices, given the surge in the demand for Hong Kong identity cards-related services after the pandemic, the ImmD extended operating hours of four ROP Offices from March 6, 2023 to December 31, 2024, and established the ROP - Kwun Tong (Temporary) Office on November 1, 2023 through internal redeployment of manpower, with a view to enhancing the overall handling capacity of ROP Offices. The ImmD coped with the demand for Hong Kong identity cards-related services through flexible manpower deployment and does not maintain a breakdown of salaries expenses for each ROP Office.

(2) To provide more convention and exhibition (C&E) facilities for fostering the long-term development of the Hong Kong C&E industry, the Government is taking forward the Wan Chai North Redevelopment project near the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre as planned, including the redevelopment of the sites of the Wan Chai Government Offices Compound, Gloucester Road Garden and the Kong Wan Fire Station into C&E facilities, hotel and office.

The Immigration Headquarters was relocated from the Immigration Tower in Wan Chai to Tseung Kwan O in June 2024. The ROP Office - Hong Kong Office (ROP HK Office), situated at the Immigration Tower in Wan Chai, continues to provide services to the public at its current site. To pave the way for the Wan Chai North Redevelopment project, the ImmD is currently identifying suitable office space in the area for the relocation of the ROP HK Office. The relocation timing and location would depend on the actual circumstances, including the progress of the Wan Chai North Redevelopment project, operational needs and service demand of the ROP HK Office. The ImmD will make suitable announcement once the details of the relocation plan for the ROP HK Office have been finalised.

(3) and (4) When relocating the ROP HK Office, the ImmD will consider factors such as transport accessibility, public service demands, and operational needs, etc, and ensure that the location chosen will be convenient for citizens. The ImmD will also continuously review the service arrangements and operations of its offices, and explore the feasibility of integrating offices and facilities of the ImmD currently scattered across different locations, with a view to providing more convenient and quality services to the public.

(5) To promote the development of a Smart Government, the ImmD has been leveraging technology to enhance service efficiency, including the provision of self-service options in application and collection for specific personal documentation services through various self-service kiosks set up at various offices.

In December last year, the ImmD enhanced the functions of the Personal Documentation Submission Kiosks (PDSKs) and introduced self-application services for Hong Kong identity cards (HKICs). Eligible applicants can complete the HKIC application procedures in a self-service manner and can apply for HKICs and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passports in one-go through the PDSKs. The application procedures, including identity verification, photo taking, data filling and electronic payment, can be completed at the PDSKs in a self-service manner without the need to make an appointment. For collection, the Personal Documentation Collection Kiosks (PDCKs) have integrated various functions of the existing collection kiosks. Eligible applicants can collect personal documents in one-go in a self-service manner.

Currently, a total of 54 new self-service kiosks, including 44 PDSKs and 10 PDCKs, have been set up at the Immigration Headquarters situated at Tseung Kwan O.

​立法會十五題：電動可移動工具,2025-07-30 11:52,2025-07-30 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000231.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上吳永嘉議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

隨着電動可移動工具（例如電動滑板車、電動滑板、電動單輪車、電動平衡車及電動輔助單車等）日趨普及，政府正研究規管電動可移動工具在香港的使用及其相關認證安排，並與相關部門進行法律草擬工作。據悉社會對上述工作的最新進展表示關注。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）當局預計何時完成制訂電動可移動工具的使用者守則及認證安排，以及何時向本會提交電動可移動工具的相關法例修訂；

（二）在相關修例工作完成前，當局會否在更多不同單車徑推行共享電動可移動工具試驗計劃；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）鑑於政府於去年六月回覆本會質詢時表示，當局會分階段在合適的情況下開放單車徑予市民使用電動個人移動工具，首階段考慮開放的路段需要有至少3.5米闊及連通度高的單車徑，然後視乎成效適時檢討是否開放更多合適的單車徑，當局有否為各條單車徑訂立開放時間表；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（四）鑑於有意見認為當電動可移動工具日後可於單車徑使用，該等單車徑的使用量應有所增加，當局會否為該等單車徑提供更多配套，例如急救站、小食亭和洗手間等設施；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直以來對推動綠色出行的新科技秉持開放態度，同時非常重視道路安全。電動可移動工具是由機械驅動，符合《道路交通條例》（第374章）中「汽車」的定義，因此現時必須領牌才可於道路或私家路上行駛。我們留意到電動可移動工具在世界各地日趨普及，但香港人口密集，人流量高、車流量大，有需要適當規管電動可移動工具的使用，才可用作有效且安全的短途出行選項。

就吳永嘉議員的提問，經諮詢運輸署後，現回覆如下：

（一）使用者方面，電動可移動工具的使用者必須年滿16歲及須佩戴頭盔。政府已成立包括業界代表和政府部門的工作小組，制訂《實務守則》，訂明電動可移動工具的技術細節、操作規則、安全提示及指引等。運輸署會繼續進行宣傳和教育的工作，灌輸正確的駕駛態度，讓市民安全及負責任地使用電動可移動工具。

產品規管方面，為確保產品安全，運輸署正就電動可移動工具制訂技術和安全要求，並計劃要求由獲第三方機構認可的認證機構測試各產品的技術規格及電機要求。電動可移動工具的生產商或代理須向認證機構申請認證，獲認證的產品會貼上二維碼認證標籤，方便市民及執法人員辨識。至於問題中提到的電池及電子設備，我們認為有需要根據國際標準進行認證測試，例如過度充電或放電控制、短路及過熱防禦、振動和機械衝擊測試等，以確保產品安全。

為確保產品認證在香港市場切實可行，運輸署早前已諮詢業界，業界一般認為安排合理。運輸署正物色具備條件的認證機構，並聯同香港生產力促進局合作草擬產品認證安排的細節，亦會繼續仔細考慮不同持份者的角色和責任，以規管產品安全，讓市民可安心選購和適當使用電動可移動工具。

政府正進行有關的法律草擬工作，糅合實際經驗以確保建議切實可行。由於議題涉及範圍廣泛，我們計劃於短期內向立法會交通事務委員會報告進展，並爭取在明年將修訂《道路交通條例》的條例草案以及新的附屬法例提交立法會審議。

（二）為了解電動可移動工具的實際使用和運作，運輸署已於將軍澳南及香港科學園附近的單車徑進行試驗計劃。當中，運輸署於二○二三至二四年在白石角進行共享電動輔助單車試驗計劃。該計劃運作大致順暢，並顯示共享模式需要適當配套（如充電池設施及充電頻率等），供政府在規劃電動可移動工具可使用路段時作參考。

（三）及（四）電動可移動工具可作為短途出行和首／尾程接駁鐵路站和車站等的代步工具，讓市民有更多主動出行方式選擇。運輸署已經積極與相關部門商討，在新發展區（例如洪水橋新發展區）建設全面的單車徑網絡，亦會在其他地區選取合適的單車徑，容納單車及電動可移動工具同時安全行駛，除非該些單車徑不符合特定的要求（例如闊度不足、與行人路或行車道交替頻繁等）。至於電動輔助單車，基於它們的操作模式近似單車，我們計劃容許它們在所有單車徑上使用。

此外，現時不少單車徑的附近已設有急救站（例如白石角和大埔海濱），小食亭或其他食肆，洗手間（例如科學園、將軍澳南海濱一帶、大埔海濱公園等）。政府也會繼續適時檢視在新界及新市鎮的單車徑和相關配套設施，推行改善措施，提升安全同時便利綠色低碳的生活模式。

至於能否開放單車徑以外的地點，政府理解市民對於電動可移動工具的接受程度不盡相同。在運輸署過去的調查中，有六成多受訪者支持在單車徑上使用經妥善規管的電動可移動工具，其餘三成多則持保留意見，關注其潛在風險和現有單車徑的空間有限。政府會小心考慮不同意見，以確保道路安全。"
LCQ15: Electric mobility devices,2025-07-30 11:52,2025-07-30 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000232.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Jimmy Ng and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

With the rising prevalence of electric mobility devices (EMDs) (such as electric scooters, electric skateboards, electric unicycles, electric hoverboards and power-assisted pedal cycles), the Government is studying the regulation of the use of EMDs in Hong Kong and associated certification arrangement. The work of drafting the legislative amendments is being conducted with the relevant departments. It is learnt that the community has expressed concern about the latest progress of the above work. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) when the authorities expect that the formulation of the code of practice for EMD users and the certification arrangements will be completed, and when will they introduce the relevant legislative amendments on EMDs into this Council;

(2) whether the authorities will implement trial of share EMDs on more different cycle tracks before the completion of the relevant legislative amendments; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) given that in the reply to a question from this Council in June last year, the Government indicated that it would open cycle tracks to the public for use of motorised personal mobility devices in phases under suitable circumstances, and that for the initial phase the cycle track sections being considered to be opened for use have to be at least 3.5 metres wide with high connectivity, and it would then review in a timely manner whether to open more suitable cycle tracks having regard to the effectiveness of the measures, whether the authorities have drawn up a timetable for opening various cycle tracks; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) as there are views that when EMDs can be used on cycle tracks in the future, the usage of such cycle tracks should increase, whether the authorities will provide more ancillary facilities for the cycle tracks, such as first aid stations, refreshment kiosks and toilets, etc; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Government has always adopted an open attitude towards new technologies for promoting green commuting, whilst attaching great importance to road safety. As electric mobility devices (EMDs) are mechanically propelled, they fall within the definition of ""motor vehicles"" under the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374) (the Ordinance) and must be licensed before use on roads or private roads. We note that EMDs are becoming increasingly popular around the world. However, given the dense population and high passenger and vehicular flow in Hong Kong, we consider that EMDs should be properly regulated before they can be used to provide effective and safe short-distance commuting options.

In consultation with the Transport Department (TD), my reply to the question raised by the Hon Jimmy Ng is as follows:

(1) Regarding users, EMD users must be at least 16 years old and wear a helmet. The Government has set up a working group, comprising representatives from the trade and government departments, to formulate a code of practice to set out the technical details, operating rules, as well as safety advice and guidelines, etc, regarding EMDs. The TD will continue its work on publicity and education, instilling into EMD users proper driving attitude to ensure the safe and responsible use of EMDs.

Regarding product regulation, to ensure product safety, the TD is formulating technical and safety requirements for EMDs, and plans to require third-party accredited certification bodies to test the technical specifications as well as the electrical and mechanical requirements of the various products. Manufacturers or agents of EMDs will be required to apply to the certification bodies for certification of products, and certified products will be affixed with a QR code certification label for easy identification by the public and enforcement officers. With regard to the batteries and electronic devices mentioned in the question, we consider that it is necessary for them to be certified according to international standards, e.g. over-charging or discharging control, short-circuit and overheating protection, vibration and mechanical shock tests, to ensure product safety.

To ensure that the product certification is practical in the Hong Kong market, the TD has been consulting the trade, who generally finds the proposed arrangements reasonable. The TD is identifying certification bodies that possess the relevant capabilities and is working in collaboration with the Hong Kong Productivity Council to formulate the details of the relevant certification arrangements, and will continue to give careful consideration to the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders with a view to regulating product safety, so that members of the public can feel confident when purchasing EMDs and use them properly.

The Government is undertaking the relevant law drafting work, and will take into consideration the actual experience to ensure the practicality of the proposal. As the topic has a wide coverage, we plan to report the progress to the Legislative Council (LegCo) Panel on Transport shortly, with the aim of introducing the Bill for amending the Ordinance and the new subsidiary legislation into the LegCo for scrutiny next year.

(2) To understand the actual usage and operation of EMDs, the TD had conducted site trials on the cycle tracks in Tseung Kwan O South and on those adjacent to the Hong Kong Science Park. In particular, the TD carried out a trial scheme on the shared use of power-assisted pedal cycles in Pak Shek Kok from 2023 to 2024. The implementation of the trial scheme was smooth in general and the results indicate that suitable ancillary facilities (e.g. battery facilities and frequency of charging) will be needed for the operation of the shared mode. The Government will make reference to such experience when planning for the road sections for use of EMDs.

(3) and (4) EMDs can serve as commuting means for short-distance travel and first-mile/last-mile connectivity to and from railway stations and stations etc, providing the general public with more options of active transport modes. The TD has been proactively discussing with relevant departments the construction of comprehensive cycle track networks in new development areas (such as the Hung Shui Kiu New Development Area), and will select suitable cycle tracks in other areas that can accommodate the safe co-use of bicycles and EMDs, except those cycle tracks which do not fulfil the particular requirements (e.g. insufficient width or frequent crossings with pedestrian footpath and vehicular roads). As for power-assisted pedal cycles, we propose allowing them to be used on all cycle tracks since their operating mode is similar to that of bicycles.

In addition, places around many cycle tracks are already provided with first aid posts (e.g. Pak Shek Kok Promenade and Tai Po waterfront), refreshment kiosks or other eateries, and toilets (e.g. the Science Park, the vicinity of Tseung Kwan O South waterfront, and the Tai Po Waterfront Park). The Government will continue to review the cycle tracks and ancillary facilities in the New Territories and new towns and implement improvement measures, with a view to enhancing safety while facilitating a green and low-carbon lifestyle.

With regard to whether it is possible to open locations other than cycle tracks, the Government understands that public acceptance of EMDs varies. In previous surveys conducted by the TD, over 60 per cent of the respondents supported the use of properly regulated EMDs on cycle tracks, while the remaining 30-odd per cent of the respondents expressed reservation, with the main concerns being the potential risks of EMDs as well as the limited space of existing cycle tracks. The Government will carefully consider the differing views to ensure road safety."

LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-30 11:50,2025-07-30 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000353.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference.

LCQ7: Scaffolding works in construction industry,2025-07-30 11:50,2025-07-30 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000261.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Ma Fung-Kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

  The Government has earlier on announced that 50 per cent of new public works building works contracts, with tenders to be invited on or after March 21 this year, are required to adopt metal scaffolding (rather than traditional bamboo scaffolding) to enhance site safety. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has looked into the causes of industrial accidents that involved working on bamboo scaffolds and metal scaffolds in the past five years (e.g. unsafe bamboo scaffolding structures, improper work procedures, or human factors);

(2)of the details of current monitoring of the use of scaffolding in the construction industry by the government departments concerned, including whether regular inspections are conducted on construction scaffolds with longer service spans;

(3)whether it has compiled statistics on the output value of construction works involving bamboo scaffolding and metal scaffolding in the past five years, the number of existing practitioners (including the number of those trained and qualified, as well as the number of those currently in employment), and the average income of the practitioners;

(4) whether it has studied if there are differences between metal scaffolding and bamboo scaffolding in terms of the construction methods and worker requirements, and their differences in the equipment required and the labour costs involved;

(5)as there are views pointing out that bamboo scaffolding remains a widely used structure in Hong Kong's construction industry, and in the light of the increasing height requirements for buildings, along with instances of super typhoons and once-in-a-century torrential rain in recent years, whether the Government will collaborate with the industry to explore ways to enhance the building technique of bamboo scaffolding to improve its safety; and

(6)given that the bamboo shed theatre building technique is one of the items in the Intangible Cultural Heritage Inventory of Hong Kong, whether the Government has studied if the building technique referred to in this item covers bamboo scaffolding or building technique of bamboo scaffolding in the construction industry; if it has studied and the outcome is in the affirmative, of the Government's plans for the inheritance and promotion of the building technique of bamboo scaffolding in the construction industry; if it has not studied, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  From industrial safety perspective, provided that the requirements of the legislation and relevant codes of practice are complied with, work safety can be ensured irrespective of what kind of scaffolding materials used.

  Metal scaffolds have been widely adopted in the construction industry in advanced economies in the world and the Mainland. To further promote the adoption of metal scaffolds, the Development Bureau (DEVB) recently required 50 per cent of new building works projects under public works of the Government (excluding maintenance projects of building façades), with tenders to be invited on or after March 21, 2025, to adopt metal scaffolds. Based on the number of projects to be tendered this year, only one or two projects will adopt metal scaffolds. The Government has no intention to ban the use of bamboo scaffolds at this moment. The DEVB will continue to engage the industry and other relevant stakeholders to jointly explore measures from various aspects (including the application of technology) to enhance work safety of bamboo scaffolds.

  Having consulted with the DEVB and the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), the consolidated reply to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Ma Fung-kwok is as follows:

(1)According to previous investigations, the common attributing factors leading to accidents involving bamboo scaffolds and metal scaffolds include failure to conduct task-specific risk assessments and formulate safe work methods before the commencement of work, resulting in lack of planning and coordination at work; improper alteration of scaffolds; performing incompatible work activities concurrently on a scaffold, affecting its stability; failure to provide workers with suitable working platforms; not providing and ensuring that workers erecting or dismantling scaffolds using suitable personal protective equipment; and inadequate safety supervision, etc. In addition, some cases were caused by workers' failure to implement occupational safety and health (OSH) measures.

(2)The current OSH legislation has specific provisions regulating scaffolding safety. The Labour Department (LD) has also issued the Code of Practice for Metal Scaffolding Safety and the Code of Practice for Bamboo Scaffolding Safety, providing practical guidelines to duty holders for safe erection, alteration, dismantling and use of scaffolds.

  According to the current relevant OSH legislation, regardless of the service spans of a scaffold, the contractor shall ensure that the scaffold has been inspected by a competent person (who has completed substantial scaffolding training and has practical experience) before being taken into use for the first time and at intervals not exceeding 14 days preceding each use. The competent person shall report his/her findings in an approved form. If the competent person finds that the scaffold is unsafe during the inspection, the contractor shall make immediate rectification to ensure the ongoing safe use of the scaffold.

  Moreover, the LD carries out spot check on scaffolds from time to time during inspections and pays close attention to scaffolding conditions, including their structures, stability, influence by weather conditions and whether being properly used by contractors etc., to ensure that contractors fulfill their responsibilities for scaffolding safety.

  Apart from regular inspections, the LD also launches special enforcement operations targeting scaffolding work safety. Stringent enforcement actions will be taken if there is violation of OSH legislation, including issuing written warnings, ""Improvement Notices"", ""Suspension Notices"" and initiating prosecutions. After issuing ""Improvement Notices"" or ""Suspension Notices"", the LD will conduct timely follow-up inspections in accordance with the established procedures until the contractor has taken adequate measures to eliminate related hazards.

  At the same time, the LD is also adopting a multi-pronged strategy, including publicity and promotion, education and training, and the use of innovation and technology, to prevent accidents from occurrence.

  On the other hand, to further strengthen the supervision of scaffolding work, the DEVB in February 2025 requires contractors and resident site staff (RSS) of public works contracts to implement additional administrative measures, including requiring contractors and RSS to independently check the number of putlogs of the scaffolds every day and requiring competent persons to submit photographs or video records as evidence when conducting inspections to the scaffolds in accordance with legislative requirements.

(3)The statistics of scaffolders registered in accordance with the Construction Workers Registration Ordinance (Cap. 583) in June2025 are as follows:




Trade Division Name
Registered Semi-skilled Workers
Registered Skilled Workers
Total


Bamboo Scaffolder
491

  According to the statistical reports of the Average Daily Wages of Workers Engaged in Public Sector Construction Projects issued by the Census and Statistics Department in April 2025, the average daily wage of ""Scaffolders"" (including metal scaffolder and bamboo scaffolder) is $1,512.2.

Note: Possessing the relevant certificates of Bamboo Scaffolder and Metal Scaffolder concurrently.

(4)Metal scaffolds and bamboo scaffolds are different in erection methods, materials used and requirements on workers' craftsmanship. The Code of Practice for Metal Scaffolding Safety and the Code of Practice for Bamboo Scaffolding Safety issued by the LD respectively set out detailed guidelines on safety and health management for metal scaffolding and bamboo scaffolding operations, technical requirements for scaffolding safety and qualifications required for scaffolders, and practical guidance on inspection, maintenance and dismantling of scaffolds.

  Based on the experience in public building works contracts, using metal scaffolds will not significantly increase the construction cost. The overall expenditure on metal scaffolds is only about two per cent of the contract sum, and the expenditure of bamboo scaffolds is about one per cent of the contract sum.

(5)To enhance bamboo scaffolding safety in the construction industry, the LD revised the Code of Practice for Bamboo Scaffolding Safety last year in consultation with the industry. The major revisions include enhancing technical requirements for bracings, putlogs and access and egress of bamboo scaffolds; prohibiting unauthorised alteration of bamboo scaffolds including putlogs; and further specifying the requirements of competent persons supervising bamboo scaffolders who perform erection, substantial addition, alteration or dismantling of bamboo scaffolds, and conducting inspections prior to inclement weather. The Code of Practice also requires all workers who perform truss-out bamboo scaffold work shall hold a valid certificate of ""Advanced Level Truss-out Scaffolder Safety Training"" or ""Intermediate Level Truss-out Scaffolder Safety Training"" issued by the Construction Industry Council before performing specified truss-out scaffold work.

  The LD will continue to maintain communication with the industry and relevant professionals, regularly reviewing and exploring the introduction of more advanced technologies and management methods to ensure the safety of bamboo scaffolding work.

(6)The Bamboo Theatre Building Technique is an item listed in the Intangible Cultural Heritage Inventory of Hong Kong (ICH Inventory). Bamboo theatres, which are built of bamboo, fir and galvanised metal sheets, are used by the local communities as temporary venues to stage Shengong opera for appeasing gods and host related festive activities during the birthdays of deities, Jiao festivals or Yu Lan Festival. Bamboo scaffolds erected for building-related works are distinct from bamboo theatres, and are not included in the ICH Inventory. In response to public suggestions to include valuable traditional items in the ICH Inventory, the Intangible Cultural Heritage Office of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department will conduct survey and research upon receiving such proposals. The findings will be submitted to the Sub-committee on Intangible Cultural Heritage Items and the Intangible Cultural Heritage Advisory Committee for review and deliberation."
立法會七題：建造業棚架工程,2025-07-30 11:50,2025-07-30 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000256.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上馬逢國議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

政府早前宣布，由今年三月二十一日起招標的工務工程新建樓宇的半數工程合約須採用金屬棚架（而非傳統竹棚架），以提升工地安全。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否研究過去五年涉及在竹棚架及金屬棚架上工作的工業意外原因（例如由於竹棚架結構不安全、施工程序不恰當或人為因素等原因）；

（二）現時相關政府部門監管建造業使用棚架的詳情為何，包括會否就一些使用期較長的建築棚架進行持續檢查；

（三）有否統計，過去五年建造業涉及竹棚架及金屬棚架工程的產值、現有從業員的數目（包括經培訓取得合資格人數及在職人數），以及從業員的平均收入為何；

（四）有否研究金屬棚架與竹棚架在搭建方法和對工人的要求上有否不同，以及所需的設施和涉及的勞動力成本的差異為何；

（五）鑑於有意見指出竹棚架仍然是本港建造業界普遍使用的構建物，隨着建築物的高度要求不斷上升，加上過去數年曾出現超級颱風和世紀暴雨，政府會否與業界合作研究提升搭建竹棚架技術，以加強其安全性；及

（六）鑑於「戲棚搭建技藝」是香港的「非物質文化遺產」清單項目之一，政府有否研究該項目所指的搭建技藝是否包括建造業的「築棚」或搭建竹棚架技術；若有研究而結果為是，政府就建造業搭建竹棚架技術的傳承和推廣所擬定的計劃為何；若未有研究，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

從工業安全的角度而言，只要遵守法例及相關工作守則的要求，不論採用何種物料的棚架均可確保施工安全。

由於國際和內地先進城市均在建造工程常採用金屬棚架，為進一步推廣應用金屬棚架，發展局早前要求在二○二五年三月二十一日或以後招標的政府工務工程新建樓宇項目（不包括樓宇外牆維修項目）的半數工程合約採用金屬棚架，而根據今年招標的項目數量，實際上只有一至兩個項目會採用金屬棚架。政府現階段無意取締竹棚架的應用，發展局會繼續與業界和其他相關持份者共同探討，如何從不同方面採取措施（包括科技的應用）提升竹棚架工作安全。

就馬逢國議員的提問，經諮詢發展局及文化體育及旅遊局後，現綜合答覆提問如下：

（一）根據過往調查發現，引致竹棚架及金屬棚架意外的常見因素包括施工前沒有進行針對性的風險評估及制訂合適的施工方案，導致施工期間欠缺規劃及協調；不當地改動棚架；同時在棚架上進行不相容的工作而影響其穩固性；沒有為工人提供合適工作平台；沒有提供及確保搭建或拆卸棚架工人使用合適的個人防護裝備；以及沒有足夠的安全監督等。此外，部份個案亦涉及工人沒有落實執行職業安全及健康（職安健）措施，導致意外發生。

（二）現行職安健法例已有具體條文規管棚架安全，勞工處亦發出《金屬棚架工作安全守則》及《竹棚架工作安全守則》，就搭建、更改、拆卸及使用棚架的安全向持責者提供實務指引。

按現行相關職安健法例，不論棚架使用時間的長短，承建商均須確保棚架在首次使用前及緊接每次使用前14天內由合資格（即完成棚架實質訓練及有實際經驗）的人士檢查，並按認可表格作出報告。若合資格人士檢查時發現棚架不安全，承建商須即時改善，以確保棚架能持續安全地使用。

此外，勞工處亦會不時在巡查期間抽查棚架，並密切留意棚架的狀況，包括其構造、穩定性，受天氣影響的情況、承建商有否恰當地使用等因素，確保承建商履行棚架安全的責任。

除了恆常巡查外，勞工處亦會針對棚架作業安全進行特別執法行動。如發現違反職安健法例，會嚴厲執法，包括發出書面警告、「敦促改善通知書」、「暫時停工通知書」及提出檢控。當發出「敦促改善通知書」或「暫時停工通知書」後，勞工處會按既定程序適時巡查跟進，直至承建商已採取充分措施消除有關危害。

與此同時，勞工處也會透過宣傳推廣、教育培訓及利用創新科技等多管齊下的策略，防止意外發生。

另一方面，為進一步加強工務工程棚架工作的監管，發展局在二○二五年二月要求工務工程的承建商和駐工地人員採取額外行政措施，包括要求承建商和駐工地人員每天均須獨立檢查棚架連牆器的數量，及合資格的人根據法規要求檢查棚架時，必須提交相片或錄影紀錄作為佐證。

（三）截至二○二五年六月，根據《建造業工人註冊條例》（第583章）註冊的棚架工統計數字如下：

根據政府統計處於二○二五年四月發出的有關從事公營建築工程的工人的每日平均工資統計報告，「棚架工」（包括金屬棚架工和竹棚工）每日平均工資為$1,512.2。

註：同時擁有竹棚工和金屬棚架工的相關證書。

（四）金屬棚架與竹棚架在搭建方法、物料使用及對工人的工藝技術要求各有不同。勞工處發出的《金屬棚架工作安全守則》及《竹棚架工作安全守則》分別詳述金屬棚架及竹棚架作業的安全及健康管理、棚架安全的技術要求、棚架工人所需具備的資歷，以及棚架檢查、維修及拆卸等提出實務指引。

根據工務工程新建樓宇合約的經驗，使用金屬棚架不會大幅提高工程造價，其整體開支大約只佔樓宇建造工程合約金額的百分之二，而使用竹棚架則約為百分之一。

（五）為加強建造業竹棚架的安全，去年勞工處諮詢業界後修訂了《竹棚架工作安全守則》。主要修訂內容包括加強對竹棚架的支撐、連牆器（俗稱「拉掹」）及進出口的技術要求；禁止擅自改動竹棚架包括連牆器；更詳細說明合資格的人在監督竹棚架工人進行架設、相當程度上的擴建、更改或拆卸竹棚時及在惡劣天氣前進行檢查的要求。該工作守則亦要求進行懸空式竹棚架（俗稱「飛棚」）工作的工人，須持有由建造業議會發出的有效「高級懸空式棚架安全訓練」或「中級懸空式棚架安全訓練」證明書，才可進行指定的飛棚工作。

勞工處會繼續與業界及相關專業人士保持溝通，不時檢討並研究引進更先進的技術和管理方法，以確保竹棚架工作的安全。

（六）「戲棚搭建技藝」是「香港非物質文化遺產清單」（非遺清單）的項目。「戲棚」是地方籌辦神誕、太平清醮或盂蘭勝會時，由竹、杉木及鋅鐵片搭蓋而成的臨時場所，用以上演「神功戲」或進行相關的節慶活動。為建築物相關工程而搭建的竹棚有別於「戲棚」，並不是非遺清單內的項目。就公眾建議將有價值的傳統項目納入非遺清單，康樂及文化事務署轄下非物質文化遺產辦事處在收到建議後會進行調硏工作，並交由非物質文化遺產項目委員會及非物質文化遺產諮詢委員會審議及考慮。"
LCQ12: Safeguarding traffic safety of bus captains and professional drivers,2025-07-30 11:40,2025-07-30 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000262.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Gary Zhang and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

According to the Report of the Independent Review Committee on Hong Kong's Franchised Bus Service published by the Transport Department (TD) in 2019, the Government indicated that it would draw reference from the standards and latest developments of vehicle safety devices overseas, and require franchised bus companies to introduce in-vehicle safety devices to enhance bus safety. However, the number of casualties involving franchised bus traffic accidents announced by the TD has been on an upward trend since 2022. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of (i) the number of casualties of franchised bus captains caused by bus collisions and their percentage in the total number of franchised bus accidents in each of the past five years, and (ii) among such cases, the number of those in which the casualties of bus captains were caused by impacts on the front ends of the buses, with a tabulated breakdown by severity of casualties (i.e. death, serious injury and slight injury);

(2) as some members of the sector have relayed that the front ends of franchised buses lack structures that can withstand collisions, and in the event of collisions, the bus captains are often in a position of being impacted at close range with a higher risk of injury, whether the Government will consider enacting legislation to require the installation of protective devices such as airbags at the captain seats of franchised buses, so as to reduce the risk of injury to bus captains in cases of collisions at the front ends of the buses; if so, of the details and timetable; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) whether the Government has, over the past 10 years, proposed relevant legislative amendments to safeguard the safety of bus captains and other professional drivers; if so, (i) of the main directions and contents of the amendments concerned, (ii) whether the amendments were proposed in the light of overseas standards and developments, or were initiated by the Government having regard to the current traffic situations in Hong Kong, and (iii) of the specific effectiveness of the amendments in safeguarding the safety of professional drivers; if the Government has not proposed such legislative amendments, whether it has plans to do so, and of the relevant timetable; and

(4) whether it has plans to introduce measures to further safeguard the traffic safety of bus captains and professional drivers; if so, of the specific plans and expected targets?

Reply:

President,

The Government attaches great importance to the safety of franchised bus captains and professional drivers and works collaboratively with the trade through various channels and measures to enhance the safety awareness of professional drivers, thereby ensuring the safety of both drivers and passengers. Having consulted the Transport Department (TD), our response to the questions raised by the Hon Gary Zhang is as follows:

(1) In the past five years, the number of casualties of franchised bus captains (i) in traffic accidents involving collision with franchised buses and their ratios to the total number of franchised bus traffic accidents; and (ii) in traffic accidents where the front end of the franchised bus was the first point of impact in collision are at Annex.

(2) Currently, the franchised buses operating in Hong Kong are manufactured in the Mainland and Europe, and all of which comply with international safety standards. They must be designed and manufactured in accordance with the requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction and Maintenance of Vehicles) Regulations (Cap. 374A)(the Regulations). Under the Regulations, every bus must be constructed of suitable materials, and its design and construction methods must be able to withstand the loads and stresses that may be encountered during operation. All buses, whether imported as complete vehicles or assembled in Hong Kong, must pass the stringent vehicle examinations of the TD before entering service, with a view to ensuring that their structure, safety, and performance meet the required standards.

The main thrust of the international safety standards is to ensure the overall structural safety of buses, reducing the risk of injury to drivers in accidents. There is no mandatory requirement for buses to be equipped with airbags. According to bus manufacturers, if bus captains wear seat belts properly and sit securely on their seats, it will effectively reduce the risk of their heads and chests colliding with hard objects during collision, thereby minimising serious injuries. On the suggestion of installing airbags, due to the relatively large surface area of the bus captain's cabin, the large airbags may cause a strong impact on bus captains when deployed. Nonetheless, we will continue to take heed of the effectiveness of safety installations (including airbags) and study whether such installations can strengthen the protection of bus captains and how to effectively enhance the protection of bus captains.

The TD will continue to maintain close communication with bus manufacturers and franchised bus operators (FBOs). In line with the technological developments, the TD will encourage FBOs to conduct trials of and introduce suitable safety equipment to further enhance bus safety and protect drivers.

(3) and (4) The Government and public transport operators are committed to enhancing the safety of services and protecting the safety of professional drivers through various measures.

In recent years, the Government has been actively motivating the operators to enhance safety by leveraging technology. For example, since 2023, over 95 per cent of buses in the franchised bus fleet have been equipped with the driver management and control system. If bus captains engage in risky driving behaviors (such as speeding, sharp cornering, harsh braking and harsh acceleration), the system will issue driving safety warnings. It will also rate the performance of bus captains to encourage them to cultivate good driving habits and skills and continuously improve driving safety standards to prevent accidents during work. In addition, FBOs have widely adopted various advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), including anti-collision and lane-keeping warning systems, and driver monitoring system to assist bus captains in safe driving. More than 2 000 franchised buses (i.e. over 30 per cent) (including all buses operating airport routes and some long-haul routes) have been equipped with the above ADAS and driver monitoring system. FBOs will install relevant systems on newly purchased buses gradually subject to circumstances.

On the other hand, it is crucial for professional drivers to maintain a good work-rest schedule to ensure safe driving. A proper work-rest schedule helps drivers stay alert at work and reduce the risk of fatigue driving.

The TD has formulated the ""Guidelines on Bus Captain Working Hours, Rest Times and Meal Break"" (Guidelines), requiring FBOs to ensure their compliance with the Guidelines in arranging duty rosters for their bus captains to provide them with adequate rest time. FBOs are also required to submit reports to the TD on a monthly basis. The TD also conducts regular surveys on the arrangements of bus captains' working hours, rest times and meal breaks. At present, all FBOs generally comply with the Guidelines in arranging rosters for bus captains. Additionally, the TD has required FBOs to include a module of sleep and fatigue management in their training programmes for bus captains. In December 2023, the TD issued the ""Practice Note on Franchised Bus Captains Fatigue Management"" to all FBOs, setting out good practices in preventing and managing fatigue for reference. For instance, FBOs should encourage and arrange regular health check-ups for bus captains.

The TD has all along been organising activities jointly with FBOs to enhance safety awareness of the trade. For instance, the TD held the Bus Safety Excellence Award Ceremony in 2024 and 2025 to commend employees (including bus captains, driving instructors, inspectors/regulators, and engineer/mechanic teams) with excellent performances in enhancing bus safety in daily operations, with a view to encouraging the trade to promote safety awareness with ongoing efforts.

For drivers of public light buses (PLB), non-franchised buses and taxis, the TD has also formulated guidelines on working hours for the trade and relevant operators to arrange work schedules in accordance with the guidelines. Drivers can refer to the guidelines to monitor their driving hours so as to avoid fatigue driving and ensure safety. Furthermore, the TD has been convening regular meetings with the PLB and taxi trades as well as distributing newsletters on a regular basis to remind them of safe driving. In collaboration with the Police, the TD has also been organising safety seminars for PLB and taxi drivers from time to time to promote safe driving knowledge and enhance their safety awareness."
立法會十二題：保障巴士車長及職業司機行車安全,2025-07-30 11:40,2025-07-30 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000242.htm,"​以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上張欣宇議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

根據運輸署於二○一九年公布的《香港專營巴士服務獨立檢討委員會報告》，政府表示會參考外國車輛安全裝置標準及最新發展，要求專營巴士公司引入車內安全裝置以提升巴士安全，然而自二○二二年起，運輸署公布的專營巴士交通意外傷亡數字呈上升趨勢。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年（i）專營巴士車長因巴士碰撞而導致傷亡的數目及其佔專營巴士意外總數的百分比，以及（ii）當中因巴士車身前端受到撞擊而導致車長傷亡的個案數目為何，並按傷亡程度（即死亡、重傷及輕傷）以表列出分項數字；

（二）鑑於有業界人士反映，專營巴士車身前端缺乏可抵禦碰撞的構造，一旦發生碰撞，巴士車長往往處於近距離被衝擊的位置，受傷風險較高，政府會否考慮立法要求在專營巴士的車長座位安裝安全氣囊等防護裝置，以減少巴士車身前端碰撞時車長的受傷風險；如會，詳情及時間表為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）過去10年，政府有否提出保障巴士車長及其他職業司機安全的相關法例修訂；如有，（i）有關修訂的主要方向及內容、（ii）該等修訂是因應外國標準及發展而提出，或是根據本港交通現況而由政府主動跟進，以及（iii）該等修訂在保障職業司機安全方面取得的具體成效為何；如政府未曾提出法例修訂，有否計劃提出修訂，以及相關時間表為何；及

（四）有否計劃推出措施進一步保障巴士車長及職業司機的行車安全；如有，具體計劃及預期目標為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府十分重視專營巴士車長及職業司機的行車安全，並透過不同渠道和措施，與業界攜手合作，提升職業司機的安全意識，以保障他們及乘客的安全。就張欣宇議員的提問，經諮詢運輸署後，現回覆如下：

（一）最近五年，專營巴士車長（i）於專營巴士碰撞的交通意外中的傷亡人數及其佔專營巴士意外總數的比率；以及（ii）因專營巴士車頭最先碰撞的交通意外中的傷亡人數載於附件。

（二）目前在本港營運的專營巴士由內地和歐洲製造，均符合國際安全標準，並須根據《道路交通（車輛構造及保養）規例》（第 374A章）的規定進行設計及製造。根據該規例，每輛巴士均須採用合適的材料；而其設計及構造方法亦須能抵受可能會在運作時遇到的負荷及應力。所有巴士在投入服務前，不論是整輛進口或在香港裝配，均必須通過運輸署嚴格的車輛檢驗，以確保其結構、安全及性能達標。

國際安全標準的重點乃確保整體巴士結構的安全，減低司機在事故中受傷的風險，並沒有強制巴士安裝安全氣袋。而巴士製造商表示，若巴士車長正確配戴安全帶，並穩固地坐於駕駛座位上，已可有效減低其頭部及胸部在碰撞中撞擊硬物的風險，從而減少嚴重傷害。就安裝安全氣袋的建議，由於巴士駕駛室表面空間較大，當大型安全氣袋展開時，可能對巴士車長構成強烈衝擊。無論如何，我們會持續留意安全裝置包括安全氣袋等的效能，並研究是否和如何有效提升對巴士車長的保護。

運輸署會繼續與巴士製造商及專營巴士營辦商保持緊密聯繫，因應相關科技發展，鼓勵營辦商試用或引入合適的安全設備，進一步提升巴士安全及保障司機安全。

（三）及（四）政府與各公共運輸服務營辦商一直致力提升服務的安全性，並透過不同措施保障職業司機安全。

近年，政府大力推動營辦商應用科技，以提升安全。舉例來說，自二○二三年起，專營巴士車隊已有超過九成半巴士配備司機管理系統。若巴士車長駕駛時作出危險駕駛行為（例如超速、急速轉彎、急煞車及急加速），系統會向車長發出安全駕駛提示，亦會向車長作出評分，以鼓勵車長養成良好的駕駛習慣及技巧，持續提升駕駛安全水平，避免工作時發生意外。此外，專營巴士營辦商現已廣泛應用防止碰撞和保持行車線警報系統等先進駕駛輔助系統，以及司機狀態監察系統，以協助巴士車長安全駕駛。現時有超過二千輛（即超過三成）專營巴士（包括所有行走機場巴士路線和部分長途路線的專營巴士）均已安裝上述的先進駕駛輔助系統和司機狀態監測系統。專營巴士營辦商會視乎情況，陸續為新購置的巴士安裝有關系統。

另一方面，職業司機保持良好作息安排對安全駕駛十分重要。良好的作息讓司機工作時能保持警覺，減少疲勞駕駛的風險。

運輸署制定了《巴士車長工作、休息及用膳時間指引》（《指引》），要求各專營巴士營辦商須確保巴士車長的編更安排符合《指引》，讓車長有足夠的休息時間，並每月向運輸署提交報告。運輸署亦會定期調查車長的工作、休息及用膳時間安排。現時，各營辦商的編更安排普遍符合《指引》。另外，運輸署亦要求專營巴士營辦商於車長的培訓課程中加入睡眠及疲勞管理課程，並於二○二三年十二月向各營辦商發出《巴士車長疲勞管理實務守則》，列出有關良好防止及管理疲勞的做法以作參考，例如營辦商應鼓勵並安排車長定期進行健康檢查。

運輸署亦一直與專營巴士營辦商合作舉辦活動，加強業界的安全意識。舉例來說，運輸署於二○二四年及二○二五年舉行了巴士安全卓越獎頒獎典禮，以表揚在日常運作中提升巴士安全表現的優秀員工（包括巴士車長、駕駛導師、車務督察／巴士站長，以及工程師／技工團隊），藉此鼓勵業界持續推動巴士的運作安全。

至於公共小巴、非專營巴士及的士司機方面，運輸署亦有為業界制定工作時間指引，讓業界及相關服務營辦商根據指引編訂司機的工作安排。司機們可以參考指引，留意自己的駕駛時數，避免在疲勞狀態下駕駛，保障安全。除此之外，運輸署一直與公共小巴及的士業界定期會面，並定期透過派發通訊，提醒業界注意公共小巴及的士司機的駕駛安全。運輸署與警方亦不時為公共小巴及的士司機舉辦安全講座，宣傳駕駛安全知識，提升他們的安全意識。"

答覆：

主席：

就陳議員各部分的提問，我現回覆如下：

（一）我們的目標是在二○二七年將「新型工業化資助計劃」（「資助計劃」）下獲支持的智能生產線增加至最少130條。自「資助計劃」推出至今，「新型工業評審委員會」（「評審委員會」）已支持66宗申請，涉及超過100條生產線。項目涉及食品製造及加工（包括健康食品）、紡織及製衣、建造材料、醫療器材、生物科技、納米纖維材料、新能源、製藥（包括中藥）、電子、印刷、器材配件及環保等行業。「資助計劃」推行至今，落實目標進度符合預期，創新科技署（創科署）會持續檢視有關進度及「資助計劃」下的各項安排，並會因應實際情況適時考慮調整績效指標。

（二）「資助計劃」的最新優化措施旨在加快申請資助額280萬元以下項目的審批流程，簡化相關文件要求及評審程序。創科署亦會視乎有關申請個案的數量，適時增加「評審委員會」會議的次數，並在有需要時以傳閱方式將申請項目提交予委員會考慮及審批。

現時，創科署會在收到「資助計劃」申請者提交的所有資料，包括必須的證明文件及補充資料後，平均可於35個工作天內向申請者通知其審批結果。在優化措施實施後，我們期望平均審批時間可進一步縮短。

自「資助計劃」推出以來，約四成項目的申請資助額為280萬元以下，創科署預期一定數目的申請公司能受惠於新優化措施，加速在香港設立更多智能生產線。

（三）發展新質生產力須從實際出發，因地制宜運用創新科技協助傳統優勢產業優化升級，同時完善新型工業發展生態環境。

我們致力透過一系列政策措施，推動傳統製造業利用創科升級轉型，包括優化「新型工業化資助計劃」，支持更多生產商邁向智能製造；並將於今年內推出為期兩年的「製造及生產線『升』級支援先導計劃」，為本地製造業提供配對資助，鼓勵他們引入智能生產的科技方案及升級轉型生產線。此外，我們將於今年內就香港新型工業中長期發展展開顧問研究，探討如何利用創新科技助力傳統製造業升級轉型，加速推動新型工業化。

藉由創科促進傳統製造業升級轉型，我們將更全面推進新型工業化，以科技創新引領產業創新，促進創科產業體系發展，健全支持新型工業發展的體制機制，提升香港競爭力，落實《香港創新科技發展藍圖》的戰略部署。"

Question:

 The Innovation and Technology Commission announced in June this year the introduction of an enhancement to the New Industrialisation Funding Scheme (NIFS) (the enhancement measure) whereby applications seeking funding support of no more than $2.8 million will be processed according to the newly established streamlined procedures to speed up the process of approving applications. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as the 2022 Policy Address envisaged subsidising the setting up of more smart production lines in Hong Kong under NIFS with the target of increasing the cumulative number of smart production lines by four times from about 30 back then to over 130 in five years, of the current progress in achieving the target; whether the authorities will consider raising the target number of smart production lines in the light of the progress in achieving the target;

(2) of the specific details of the streamlined procedures under the enhancement measure; whether it has estimated the extent to which the processing time for applications will be shortened after the introduction of the enhancement measure compared with that before the enhancement, and of the number of manufacturers as well as small and medium enterprises which are expected to benefit from the enhancement measure; and

(3) how the authorities will leverage and strengthen the advantages and solid foundations of traditional industries (such as the textiles and garment industry), and support their upgrading and transformation through the integration of innovation and technology, so as to promote the development of new quality productive forces and new industrialisation according to local conditions?

Reply:

President,

My reply to various parts of the question raised by Hon Tan is as follows:

(1) It is our target to have at least 130 smart production lines supported under the New Industrialisation Funding Scheme (NIFS) by 2027. Since the launch of the NIFS, 66 applications involving over 100 production lines were supported by the New Industrialisation Vetting Committee (the Committee). The projects cover various sectors such as food manufacturing and processing (including health food), textiles and clothing, construction materials, medical devices, biotechnology, nanofiber materials, new energy, pharmaceutical products (including Chinese medicine), electronics, printing, equipment and parts, and green technology, etc.The implementation progress is on track so far. The Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC) will continue to review the progress and various arrangements under the NIFS, and will consider adjusting the key performance indicators timely having regard to actual circumstances.

(2) The latest enhancement measure for the NIFS aims to speed up the approval process of applications seeking funding support of no more than $2.8 million by streamlining the relevant documentation requirement and assessment procedures. Depending on the number of applications received, the ITC will increase the frequency of the Committee meetings as appropriate, and to submit the applications to the Committee for consideration and approval by circulation if needed.

 Currently, the ITC informs the NIFS applicants of the vetting results within 35 working days on average upon receipt of full information, including the necessary supporting documents and supplementary information. We anticipate that the average processing time can be further shortened following the implementation of the enhancement measure.

 Since the launch of the NIFS, approximately 40 per cent of the applications seek funding support of no more than $2.8million. The ITC anticipates that a number of applicant companies will benefit from the new enhancement measure, accelerating the establishment of more smart production lines in Hong Kong.

(3) New quality productive forces has to be developed according to actual circumstances and local conditions, which facilitate the upgrading and transformation of traditional industries with competitive advantages with the use of innovation and technology (I&T), while simultaneously improve the development ecosystem for new industrialisation.

We are committed to promoting the upgrading and transformation of the traditional manufacturing industry with the use of I&T through a series of policies and measures. These include enhancing the NIFS to support more manufacturers in transforming to smart production, as well as launching the two-year ""Pilot Manufacturing and Production Line Upgrade Support Scheme"" this year to provide funds to local manufacturers on a matching basis, encouraging them to adopt smart production technologies and upgrade their production lines. Furthermore, we will commence a study within this year on the medium to long-term development of new industrialisation in Hong Kong to explore the upgrading and transformation of the traditional manufacturing sector with the use of I&T and accelerate the development of new industrialisation.

By leveraging I&T to upgrade and transform the traditional manufacturing industry, we will advance new industrialisation more comprehensively. Through technological innovation driving industry innovation, we will foster the development of an I&T industry system, strengthen an institutional mechanism supporting new industry development, and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness with a view to implementing the strategic deployment set out in the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint."

 The Clinical Trial Collaboration meeting provides strategic guidance on promoting clinical trial collaboration between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, co-ordinating joint research efforts, supporting the launch of international multi-centre clinical trials, and addressing the challenges encountered during implementation. During the meeting, representatives from both Hong Kong and Shenzhen had in-depth exchanges and discussions on the Implementation Plan for Collaborative Advancement of International Clinical Trials in the GBA, with the goal of further strengthening co-ordination and driving execution of the initiatives.

 The executive bodies of the Clinical Trial Collaboration - representatives from the GBA International Clinical Trial Institute (GBAICTI) in the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone and the GBA International Clinical Trials Center (BAY TRIAL) in the Shenzhen Park - also gave a progress report on key initiatives to advance clinical trial collaboration. This included the latest developments and proposed services of the GBA Clinical Trial Collaboration Platform, which will be jointly established by the end of this year. The key areas include project evaluation, trial design consultation, and subject recruitment planning for multi-centre clinical trials, provided by a joint Shenzhen-Hong Kong advisory team; introduction of artificial intelligence technologies to assist with matching of clinical trial institutions and researchers, as well as offering consultation services; establishment of a co-ordinated ethics review mechanism between the two places to enhance approval efficiency; promotion of talent exchange, collaboration, and professional training; building of a research talent pool to facilitate talent mobility and regional collaboration; and as a pilot, the development of clinical databases and biobanks based on diseases in which Shenzhen and Hong Kong have advantages. In addition, the Shenzhen and Hong Kong sides also discussed further integrating the measure of using Hong Kong-registered drugs and medical devices used in Hong Kong public hospitals in the GBA with real-world studies in an effective manner, exploring the use of real-world data to support drug registration and approval in the Mainland at the meeting.

 The Clinical Trial Collaboration meeting today marks a critical step forward in enhancing co-ordinated development of clinical research and promoting biomedicine innovative application within the GBA, creating a good start for the Clinical Trial Collaboration. The simultaneous launch of the GBAICTI and the BAY TRIAL last year marked the beginning of a new chapter in cross-border collaboration under the ""one zone, two parks"" model by the ""one institute, one center"" framework, showcasing the joint commitment and concerted efforts of both places to promote medical innovation. The Clinical Trial Collaboration meeting aims to create a more efficient co-ordination mechanism, overseeing Shenzhen-Hong Kong clinical research collaboration at the strategic level.

 Representatives from the GBAICTI and the BAY TRIAL signed a Memorandum of Understanding after the meeting to further strengthen collaboration between Shenzhen and Hong Kong in the field of clinical research. Shortly after, the two parties also signed a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding with representatives from Immuno Cure BioTech, based in the Hong Kong Science Park, and Shenzhen Branch of the Hong Kong Science Park in Futian District, for the first ever cross-border clinical trial project. Together, they will jointly promote the cross-border multi-centre Phase II clinical trial of ICVAX, a therapeutic nucleic acid vaccine for HIV co-developed by Immuno Cure and the AIDS Institute of the University of Hong Kong.

 The HKSAR Government delegation was led by the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, with members comprising Deputy Secretary for Health Ms Elaine Mak; the Deputising Chief Executive of the Hospital Authority, Dr Simon Tang; the GBAICTI Chief Executive Officer, Professor Bernard Cheung; and representatives from the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, the LKS Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong and the Faculty of Medicine of the Chinese University of Hong Kong."

The Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board (HKMPDB) held its first meeting today (July 29). Members were briefed on experts' analysis of the latest developments in Hong Kong's port and maritime industry and discussed the strategy for positioning Hong Kong as an international maritime centre under the current geopolitical situation. With the target of developing Hong Kong into a ""global maritime capital"", the HKMPDB worked to formulate a more outgoing and comprehensive Mainland and overseas promotional plan, and identify key research areas for relevant committees to commence studies in the near term.

The Chairman of the HKMPDB, Dr Moses Cheng said, ""At today's meeting, members responded to the Government's call for adopting an innovative spirit and global perspective in exploring directions for consolidating and enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international maritime centre, and setting out the key priorities for promotion and research. The HKMPDB will adopt a high-level and broad vision, complemented by actions as its core, to lead the four committees in taking forward various tasks with a view to bringing new vitality to the industry's development.""

During the meeting, members of the HKMPDB were briefed by the Shipping Research Centre of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University on the current situation, strengths, challenges, and opportunities of key segments within the Hong Kong international maritime centre (including port, high value-added maritime services, and the Hong Kong Shipping Registry). Members agreed that in the light of rising protectionism and complex geopolitics, Hong Kong should strive to develop the port industry and high value-added maritime services as its dual pillars, and establish itself as a safe harbour for international shipping enterprises in decision-making, transactions, innovation, financing, risk management, and dispute resolution.

As regards the strategies for Mainland and overseas promotional work, the HKMPDB will adopt a more proactive and comprehensive approach. In addition to regular visits to key maritime regions, new arrangements will be introduced to support members to go global to participate in prominent Mainland and overseas events by delivering speeches and telling good stories of Hong Kong maritime. Other key initiatives include deepening engagement and collaboration with influential international organisations, and continuing to attract international maritime organisations to hold conferences in Hong Kong. The meeting also identified priority research areas for the four committees which suitably echoed with the Government's policy priorities.

Lastly, members noted that the Transport and Logistics Bureau, in collaboration with three maritime arbitration institutions in Hong Kong, has been producing a promotional leaflet that clearly and practically explains the procedural steps to be taken by shipowners, charterers, or cargo owners before signing contracts for vessel chartering in choosing Hong Kong as the arbitration venue for maritime disputes. The leaflet will be distributed to relevant shipping enterprises and stakeholders in August and will also be uploaded to the HKMPDB website.

The Secretary for Transport and Logistics and member of the HKMPDB, Ms Mable Chan, said, ""The Country supports Hong Kong's strategic positioning as an international maritime centre. Driving forward the enhancement of quantity and quality of the Hong Kong Port; identifying new growth points for high value-added maritime services; deepening international engagement to elevate Hong Kong's global influence; and establishing a talent pool in light of industry trends such as green transformation, are currently pivotal issues for Hong Kong's maritime industry. The HKMPDB is charting its future work along these directions and has put forward various constructive suggestions. The Government will continue to collaborate with the industry in advancing high quality development of the industry together.""

The Chief Executive announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the HKMPDB will be established as a high-level advisory body to assist the Government in formulating policies for advancing the development of Hong Kong's maritime industry. The Government announced the membership of the HKMPDB and its four committees (namely the Port Development Committee, the Maritime Services Development Committee, the Promotion and External Relations Committee, and the Manpower Development Committee) in June this year. The HKMPDB successfully held its first meeting today, and the respective committees will convene their meetings over the next two months."

民政及青年事務局局長︰大家好，首先歡迎大家出席今日的二○二五年青年節啟動禮。特區政府非常重視青年發展，為了配合青年發展的政策目標和《青年發展藍圖》，我們在二○二三年開始，每年都舉辦青年節。過去兩屆青年節，我們共舉辦了超過400項活動，吸引超過40萬人次參與。

二○二五年「青年節@HK」會繼續以「正向思維」、「推動創新」及「啟發創意」為主題，而口號就是剛才在啟動禮時師友們所提到，希望做到「正向新世代，未來更『青』彩」。活動包括很多不同的亮點項目，會由政府部門、社會各界、青年或地區團體和非政府機構一起舉辦。希望透過這些活動，可以鼓勵青年人擴闊視野，認識和把握多元發展的機遇。

就亮點項目而言，二○二五年青年節的活動類型涵蓋知識交流、藝術文化、運動相關、生涯規劃和創業創新項目等。第二屆青年發展高峰論壇，將會在今年九月二十七日繼續舉辦，作為青年節的其中一個亮點項目。希望社會各界與我們一起攜手為優秀的香港青年，搭建更多平台，提供更多機會，讓青年人可以找到他們的目標，發展他們的潛能，達到他們的理想。多謝大家。

記者：今早黑雨，港島東的情況比較嚴重，想知道關愛隊有沒有做甚麼措施？出動了多少人和用了多少時間？

民政及青年事務局局長：今早的極端天氣是突然出現，由八時多到九時十分發出黑雨警告，其實是很短的時間。我很感謝18區關愛隊各位隊長和隊員，大家都有留意天氣報告，主動收集地區情況，即時收集地區一些出現水浸或其他情況，並通知民政專員，我們亦透過民政處（民政事務處）的網絡通知關愛隊隨時準備。為應對今早黑雨，民政處開放了10個臨時庇護中心供有需要的市民使用。但大家知道雨勢快來快去，所以使用的人不多，而關愛隊在這段時間亦全程候命，尤其是一些特別的區域，例如東區或南區，曾經受到暴雨影響的區域，所有關愛隊已早有準備，如有需要，會立刻協助當區有需要的居民疏散到庇護中心。但幸好今早雨勢快來快去，因此影響未算很大。

記者：益豐大廈的電力供應今日再次出現問題，據當局了解，管理公司的負責人到底有沒有到現場幫助居民？管理公司處理事件有沒有問題？會不會協助居民追究這家公司？這家公司是不是有意圖推卸責任給政府？翻查資料，這家管理公司也負責管理很多租置和私人屋苑，當局會不會擔心其他由這家公司負責管理的大廈日後會出現同樣問題？謝謝。

民政及青年事務局局長：大家都很關心益豐大廈的電力中斷事故。事故原因是星期六晚大廈本身的水管爆裂，浸壞了供電設施。因為這幢大廈並不是一般的三無大廈，即是說他們有法團，又有專業的物業管理公司，所以事故出現後，居民當然是聯絡大廈管理處，但發覺管理處不能夠提供即時幫助，所以居民亦向當區區議員反映，所以區議員去到現場，大家也看到這個情況。

大廈法團的業主，他們都沒有經驗處理，也是靠專業的物業管理公司。大家可能記得，我們已為全港的物業管理公司設立發牌制度，每間管理公司都有持牌人，除了管理公司的持牌人，物管人員也需持牌，即是說不單公司需持牌，管理人員也需持牌。物監局（物業管理業監管局）發牌予物管公司和物管人員也有不同的操守守則，英文是Code of Conduct，其中一個操守守則是處理緊急情況，每間物業管理公司需要為所負責的樓宇，制訂出現緊急事故時的預備方案。甚麼是緊急事故？在物監局發給物管公司的指引內清楚列明，當中包括電力中斷。所以在電力供應暫停時要如何處理，包括需要一位持牌的物管人員到現場提供協助，或為業主提供專業意見，或找合適維修人員進行緊急維修工程等，這些全部已包括在物監局發給物業管理公司的指引內。這次事故後，我們要看看相關的物管公司，既然已是物監局下持牌的管理公司，以及其負責人也是持牌的物管人員，他們有沒有按照守則辦事？除了守則外，還有良好作業指南，教導人員如何處理突發事故，所以我們一定會跟進。

就益豐大廈事故，我們看到當時的情況，包括管理公司未能精確、準確地告訴居民究竟他們打算如何協助法團進行維修工程，令電力供應能夠盡快恢復。如果大家有印象，最初是表示不知道何時恢復電力，後來表示可能一星期後恢復電力，這個情況自然是不理想。不要說天氣炎熱與否，香港市民都不會接受家中突然停電，還要不知何時才復電，又或一個星期後才復電。所以當時透過區議員、立法會議員和關愛隊的反映，民政處也發揮了協調作用，協調中電（中華電力有限公司）、機電署（機電工程署）一起為這幢大廈想出解決電力中斷問題的方案。最終，我們感謝中國建築（中建）的社區應急義工隊，他們協助進行一些緊急維修工程，所以益豐大廈的電力供應，在星期六晚上，即星期日凌晨，其中電錶房損壞程度較少的兩座大廈已恢復供電。餘下兩座電錶房損壞程度較大的大廈，透過中電和中建義工隊和機電署同事協助他們找出新方案，不是維修舊的電錶房，而是用新的方法搭電，令餘下兩座大廈在不足48小時內恢復供電，比管理公司預期的日子快上幾日。

能令益豐大廈電力中斷事故提早幾日恢復供電，我要感謝中電和機電署同事，為大廈想出新的方案，還要感謝中國建築社區應急義工隊，在市民最需要幫忙時為這座大廈進行緊急維修工程。但我們強調，大廈管理和設施維修一定是業主的責任。而業主們成立業主立案法團，聘請了專業物業管理公司，這些物業管理公司便有責任為屋苑和大廈樓宇提供專業的支持，協助業主立案法團和業主進行妥善的維修保養工作。

我藉這次機會呼籲全港業主，大家一定要齊心做好樓宇管理。因為若出現緊急情況，這次我們很幸運，社會有很多熱心人眾志成城參與，不單有中電、機電署和中建做了技術和工程支援，社區方面亦開放了兩個社區客廳給市民休息，而民政事務總署（民政總署）也開放了兩個庇護中心，加上康文署（康樂及文化事務署）提供的場地，總共有三個庇護中心。當晚因為到庇護中心的市民人數太多，甚至需要半夜跨區找設施安排給益豐大廈受影響的居民。這次多個政府部門、關愛隊、區議員和立法會議員，發揮了地區治理、眾志成城協助有需要居民的作用。但管理好自己樓宇的責任，一定是在法團和協助法團管理的物業管理公司上。我很希望日後大家都能盡好責任，好好管理自己的樓宇。

回答你的問題，究竟當日物管公司是否能夠提供適切的協助？我們稍後會研究。正如剛才我說，物監局發給所有持牌物管公司和物管人員的守則列明緊急事故時的處理方法，究竟有沒有妥善設計方案？是否有指定人士協助大廈在遇到緊急維修時要進行工程或工作？物監局同事一定會繼續跟進。

記者：益豐大廈本身有多張渠務修葺令和驗樓令，有了這些通知後大廈都未有修理，今次水管爆裂是否這些地方出事？整個事故是否與失修有關？另外，除了關愛隊外，有沒有優先請中電或機電署協助處理問題，而不是等待地區人士處理？

民政及青年事務局局長：剛才我提到關愛隊、區議員、立法會議員、中電、機電署、中國建築社區應急義工隊，以及民政事務總署、民政事務處和康文署的工作，大家都看到整件事有很多持份者，可能我有說漏了，還有警方、消防。不同部門於事發當晚都傾盡全力，出盡人手，出盡資源，解決市民最迫切要解決的問題，尤其是在那四棟大廈內有兩間安老院，院舍內的長者怎樣得到適當的照顧，還有包括社會福利署，所以你看到許多政府部門參與協助。

政府部門、社會各界、私人機構，大家都一起合力幫忙做好益豐大廈這事件，目的只有一個，就是希望能夠盡快恢復電力供應，令市民受到的影響減至最低。但是在大家一起眾志成城協助受影響居民的同時，作為物業管理公司，他們管理的責任是不能夠因此而忽略的。

所以正如剛才你提到的日常維修管理，這家物業管理公司有沒有協助業主立案法團做好維修工作，這也是稍後物監局會跟進的範圍。

記者：剛剛提到管理公司是持牌的，現在除了出事之後再去跟進或推出守則，之後會否加緊監管去確保他們是有做事？

民政及青年事務局局長：我要解釋背景讓你明白，自從物監局成立至今，本來非持牌的物管公司都已經持牌，即所有在香港協助業主立案法團、受聘於業主立案法團或業主組織，管理、做日常樓宇管理工作的物業管理公司和物管人，都會在物監局領取不同的牌照。

他們申請牌照時都需要符合不同資格，包括需要有專業學術資格或有工作經驗。而這些工作經驗和學術資格就正正是為何發牌給他們的原因，就是要確保當有事故發生時，他們有能力應對，還有在日常他們有足夠的專業知識，協助法團和業主進行這些工作。若有人未能做到的話，一定不能夠達到牌照條款內的要求，這個情況一定是物監局作為一個監管機構會去跟進的。

所以我剛才說，究竟他是不是有根據物監局提出的操守守則？因為物監局就專業物管人和物管公司發出了不同的操守守則，他們有沒有遵守這些守則，這個一定是物監局跟進的工作。物監局在成立的過去幾年以來，尤其是過去一年，當所有物管公司和物管人都需要領牌後，他們對於所有持牌的物管公司和物管人，有沒有按照《建築物管理條例》（第344章），以及在《物業管理服務條例》（第626章）這兩條條例下，要求物管公司盡責任，他們是非常嚴格監督的，亦都會就有問題的公司作出跟進，甚至是紀律行動。

記者︰知不知道大廈有那麼多張未遵辦的渠務修葺令和驗樓令？以及這次出事的渠是否與這些未遵辦的地方有關？

記者︰會否考慮追究這間公司？會否停牌？

民政及青年事務局局長︰為確保樓宇安全，建築署就不同樓宇可能會發出一些維修要求或修葺令。我們要確保這些命令能夠遵行，這個一定是，必定是，法律上都是，每一個業主的責任。所以我藉這個機會再次呼籲業主，當收到政府部門，無論是消防處發出的命令，還是建築署發出的命令，請各位業主盡快遵辦有關的命令。因為不遵辦，你不單需要承擔法律責任，第二就是當這些設施損壞時，受害受苦的都是自己。

很多業主提出，他們在召開法團會議或業主會議去管理他們的樓宇、執行這些命令時有困難。首先，發展局、建築署或市區重建局皆提供了很多不同的資助計劃，可以在現金上支援業主，就他們的樓宇進行相關的維修工程。民政總署也有一個大廈管理專業顧問服務計劃，如果一些大廈未成立法團，因沒有法團而開不了業主大會，執行不了這些命令，我們有一個計劃去協助這些大廈成立業主立案法團，協助他們營運，讓他們可以執行這些命令。同時最近我們提出「聯廈聯管」計劃，在一些舊區的老舊樓宇，戶數較少，樓齡較長的大廈，可以加入「聯廈聯管」計劃，由不同專業管理公司，協助他們召開業主大會和法團會議，為他們執行不同的政府維修令或消防令等，要確保每一個業主得到適當的支援召開會議，做好樓宇管理和維修工作。

我再次強調，這些命令發出後，請每一個業主都要嚴格遵守和遵行。因為你要負擔相關的法律責任，而且當這些設施受到損壞時，受害的會是自己。這個不是要靠別人告訴你，日日看着你做得如何，業主一定有自己的責任，而為甚麼他們要聘請這些物業管理公司，物業管理公司都有責任幫助業主，事實上持牌物業管理公司獲發牌時，給他們的操守守則其中一點，便是要協助這些業主組織召開會議，執行政府發出的各項維修保養或修葺命令，這些都是大家的責任。但是我們明白在執行這些工作時會有難度，所以我們就着一些樓宇業主，尤其是年長的業主，沒有經驗的業主，民政總署特別在今屆政府推出了不同計劃支援這些業主，方便他們召開會議，然後執行這些命令，我希望大家善用今屆政府提供予大家的支援和協助。我們有這麼多的計劃，請大家都可以善用。如果大家在處理這些問題時有任何困難，在完善地區治理後，第七屆區議會都很願意協助居民，做好自己自身樓宇管理的工作。區議會願意提供協助，民政總署也會提供協助，而更重要的是這些專業持牌的物管公司，他們要發揮到自己的功能和職責，協助業主組織遵行這些命令，大家一起做好樓宇管理工作。

我們再次藉這個機會，多謝過去幾日在益豐大廈，不眠不休、捱更抵夜的各個政府部門同事、立法會議員、區議員和關愛隊的隊長、隊員和所有義工，還有在社區裏，包括我所提及的一些機構，包括是中電、中建的社區應急義工隊，多謝大家在市民最需要的時候，提供了適切幫助，讓益豐大廈在這次電力中斷事件中，能夠較大廈或管理公司所定的目標提早恢復供電。在此多謝大家的努力，亦希望透過這次事件，引起大家對於妥善做好樓宇管理工作的關注。這個首要一定是業主的責任，亦是持牌物管公司的責任去協助業主組織。政府一定會願意提供所有支援協助業主遵行法庭或政府部門要求的維修令或要求，希望大家攜手做好樓宇管理的工作，讓市民都可以安居樂業。"

FEHD steps up inspections at food premises (with photos),2025-07-29 20:10,2025-07-29 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/29/P2025072900733.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety and the Environmental Hygiene Branch of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to jointly step up inspections of food premises to protect food safety of the public.

A spokesman for the FEHD said today (July 29), ""The FEHD continues to step up inspections of food premises, including those shops selling Lo Mei. Special attention is being paid to food storage, preparation and hygiene to ensure compliance with safety standards and relevant legislation. In the event of any breaches of food safety or health requirements, the FEHD will take stringent follow-up action. We have also strengthened communication with the trade to remind food premises to adhere to Good Hygiene Practices and to promote food safety awareness.""

The spokesman said the inspections cover the key aspects of food storage and preparation, including checking the compliance of food storage temperature to ensure that cold food is kept at or below 4 degrees Celsius while hot food is kept at or above 60 degrees C. Moreover, the inspections also aim to check if raw and cooked foods are separately stored and handled to prevent cross-contamination, if adequate liquid soap is provided, and to ensure food handlers maintain personal hygiene such as thorough hand washing before and after handling food to reduce the risk of food contamination.

In mid-June, the FEHD inspected about 2 800 food premises across the territory, carried out immediate rectifications, issued warnings and health advices, and initiated eight prosecutions in total on aspects relevant to food storage, preparation and hygiene. The operations are ongoing.

The FEHD appeals to food businesses to follow Good Hygiene Practices and make reference to the following advice when preparing food:
â

Wash hands thoroughly before and after handling food, and keep hands and utensils clean. Handwashing facilities should be equipped with adequate supply of liquid soap;
Store and handle raw and cooked foods separately to prevent cross-contamination;
Cook food thoroughly until the core temperature reaches at least 75 degrees C, and keep the cooked food at above 60 degrees C if not consumed immediately;
Pre-cooked food subjected to cold storage should be cooled from 60 degrees C to 20 degrees C within two hours, and from 20 degrees C to 4 degrees C inside a chiller within the next four hours;
Food handlers should report to their supervisor immediately and refrain from working if they feel sick;
When handling vomitus, wear gloves and apply 1:49 diluted household bleach (by adding one part of bleach containing 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite to 49 parts of water) to clean and disinfect contaminated areas or items thoroughly. Wash hands thoroughly afterwards; and
Provide food handlers with regular training on food safety, environment and personal hygiene.
