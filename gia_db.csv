律政司司長林定國資深大律師在致開幕辭時表示，律政司在去年發布的《粵港澳大灣區法治建設行動綱領》中，將推動設立專屬大灣區律師的組織平台列為重點任務之一；去年的《施政報告》也明確提出相關措施，足見香港特別行政區政府對推動大灣區法律人才隊伍建設的高度重視。他感謝司法部和廣東省司法廳大力支持成立粵港澳大灣區律師聯會，期望聯會未來與律政司緊密合作，共同推動大灣區律師試點工作，為大灣區律師制度恆常化創造有利條件，貢獻國家涉外法治建設。

粵港澳大灣區律師聯會籌備辦公室代表、中國法律服務（香港）有限公司董事長劉長春在會上介紹聯會的宗旨、職能和重點活動。聯會的主要職責包括團結愛國愛港的香港律師，充分發揮大灣區律師在國家涉外法治建設中的作用，促進香港法律界人士積極融入國家發展大局；加強大灣區律師業界交流合作，組織大灣區律師參加內地和香港的專業活動，爲已取得粵港澳大灣區律師執業證書的人員、擬在內地執業的大灣區律師執業考試合格人員和大灣區律師執業考試報名人員提供聯絡、諮詢、培訓等服務，以及了解分析大灣區律師執業遇到的困難和問題，研究提出對策建議等。

第一屆粵港澳大灣區律師論壇以「灣區聯通揚帆遠航」為主題，香港與內地的法律界翹楚圍繞「大灣區律師跨境協作與未來發展」發表主題演講。律政司副司長張國鈞博士首先發表主題演講，闡述香港的獨特優勢，憑作為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的策略性定位，以及律政司推出用以鞏固香港作為「超級聯繫人」與「超級增值人」角色的措施，使之成為助力內地企業走出去、外國企業引進來的首選夥伴。廣東省司法廳廳長陳旭東在主題演講介紹廣東省落實國家對港澳法律服務開放政策的情況和發展方向。多位講者亦分享有關大灣區律師制度及執業規管體制、爭議解決實務，以及港澳投資企業在法律選擇權上的規則創新與司法實踐。

在題為「『一國兩制三法域』的獨特優勢—粵港澳大灣區律師助力企業破浪出海」的論壇上，知名大灣區律師與內地律師交流執業經驗，並探討具備雙重執業資格的大灣區律師如何從多方面善用粵港澳「一國兩制三法域」的獨特優勢，助力內地企業「出海」。

"Speech by SCST at British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong 2025 Asia's World City - 4th Business Forum themed ""PLAY: Culture and Entertainment in Hong Kong""",2025-12-05 13:18,2025-12-05 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/05/P2025120500376.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong 2025 Asia's World City - 4th Business Forum themed ""PLAY: Culture and Entertainment in Hong Kong"" today (December 5):

Jeremy (Chair of the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong's (BritCham) General Committee, Mr Jeremy Sheldon), Nick (Head of HK CEO Office, HSBC, Mr Nick Holmes), Paul (Executive Director of the BritCham, Mr Paul McComb), Anthony (Executive Director of theHong Kong Tourism Board, Mr Anthony Lau), friends,

Good morning.

The theme of today's Business Forum is ""PLAY: Culture and Entertainment in Hong Kong"". In the last few days, of course I have been reviewing my speech, and I couldn't help but wonder: should I ask to speak on a different theme during this difficult juncture, a juncture when the city of Hong Kong is collectively working hard to get out of the haze of the Tai Po fire? 

In the end, I decided that I should continue to speak on the original theme. All of you who are with me here today are no strangers to Hong Kong. From the introduction of Nick and Jeremy, you could see they probably call the city their home, or at least their second home. A lot of us actually were born here, grew up here. And we love this city. As a community we need time to bring relief to the disaster, and to heal from the immense sorrow. But we also need to see hope, to see light at the end of the tunnel, in order to stay motivated and focused enough to help one another, and help ourselves in the process.

So my sincere thanks once again must therefore go to Jeremy for the invitation, so that I may, through addressing the distinguished British business community here today, have an opportunity to introduce our cultural and mega events which can bring light and hope for a better tomorrow.

One year ago, on December 5, 2024, I was appointed the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China. I outlined a few priorities as I took up office, and two of the most important items among them were the opening of the Kai Tak Sports Park and the successful organisation of the 15th National Games of the People's Republic of China. These are no child's play indeed.

The successful opening of the Kai Tak Sports Park on March 1, 2025, now seems a long time ago, right? I believe quite a number of you in the audience would have taken part in some of Kai Tak's inaugural events -the World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 in early March, the Hong Kong Sevens, which Jeremy just now spoke about, in end-March which was rated by many veterans as the best Sevens ever, although this is the very first time it took place in Kai Tak. The Coldplay ""Music of the Spheres"" concerts in early April, the Hong Kong Football Festival in late July which we saw Liverpool facing AC Milan and also Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspurs staging their first ever North London Derby outside of London. That is a big thing for football fans. The list goes on, but I won't try to describe the excitement one feels when one steps into Kai Tak Stadium for the very first time; be it a sports or entertainment mega event, no words can fit that bill of describing how amazing, how really wonderful Kai Tak Stadium is.

The completion of the Kai Tak Sports Park, the biggest ever sports and entertainment infrastructure in Hong Kong worthy of over $30 billion, puts Hong Kong right back on the global and regional events map. We were kind of losing out a little bit before the operation of Kai Tak because we simply didn't have a big enough stadium for international major events or major tournaments or pop concerts. But Kai Tak not only puts us back on the map; it makes us shine. With the 50 000 capacity Kai Tak Stadium and the 10 000 capacity Kai Tak Arena, the Kai Tak Sports Park is now a prime destination for regional and international concert tours and sports tournaments, and fans of pop and sports stars from either Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland even Asia now find the Kai Tak Sports Park both novel and familiar, huge but accessible, and some even have their own secret havens for post-event supper in the Kowloon City area. Talk about the night economy!

The smooth opening and operation of the Kai Tak Sports Park significantly boosted our capacities and confidence to successfully cohost the 15th National Games of the People's Republic of China together with Guangdong and Macao.

First of all, I need to tell you how incredibly proud I am of our 602 athletes of Team Hong Kong. Their final tally of nine gold, two silver and eight bronze medals surpassed the achievement of any previous Hong Kong delegation to the National Games.

But there is so much more beyond the medals. This edition of the National Games - our country's highest-level multi-sport event - is historic; it is the first time that the Games are staged across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. It promotes sports exchange and co-operation within the Greater Bay Area, and provides an invaluable experience for Hong Kong to host more mega and cross-boundary events with other cities in the Greater Bay Area. It is, more importantly, a shining example and testament to the ""one country, two systems"" principle. The unprecedented cohosting arrangement powerfully affirms that Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macao, each with unique systems, can join hands and leverage our respective strengths to achieve something truly exceptional and inspirational.

Building on that success, we are now cohosting the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games with Guangdong and Macao. Events in Hong Kong begin just this week. I invite you all to join us in giving strong support to all the participating athletes.

Integration of the Greater Bay Area and sports development aside, the National Games also provides Hong Kong with valuable opportunities to promote ourselves and attract visitors from the Chinese Mainland and overseas. For example, some of you would have noticed or even taken part, we have staged the triathlon event along the world-famous Victoria Harbourfront, the beach volleyball event at Victoria Park in the heart of Causeway Bay, the golf event at Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling, and the rugby sevens event, of course, at Kai Tak Stadium. 

This integration of sports events with tourist attractions has created a new experience for our visitors. And I am pleased to note that our tourism sector has started to capitalise on this, and especially on the National Games to roll out tailor-made tourism products across the Greater Bay Area. Such efforts have borne fruit - more than 1.7 million visitors came to Hong Kong during the National Games period, a 19 per cent increase over the same period last year.

Building on this, the Hong Kong SAR Government is now working hand-in-hand with our partners in the commercial sector to bring more attractive events here. Just now, I think it's Nick who alluded to a prime example, and that is our recent multi-year partnership with LIVGolf to host the LIV Golf League in Hong Kong in 2026 and 2027. I am actually very hopeful that English golfers such as Paul Casey and Tyrrell Hatton will compete in the event from March 5 to 8, 2026.

Right after the LIV Golf 2026, Hong Kong Sevens, organised by Hong Kong China Rugby since 1976, will celebrate its Golden Jubilee from April 17 to 19, 2026. Now don't worry. We close the roof and there will be air conditioning. Not scorching at all. But I look forward to seeing all of you in an event jersey at Kai Tak over the Rugby Sevens period.

I am confident that what I just said has already had you marking your diaries to ensure that you won't miss out on any of the attractive events. Indeed, Hong Kong's mega events are not isolated occurrences; many a time they are much more than mere entertainment. Collectively, they are a powerful magnet, a dynamic engine, and a key pillar solidifying Hong Kong's position as a premier international city. That's our soft power. And, unlike in many other places, mega events in Hong Kong are not held in distant, far-away venues. They happen right in the heart of our city - among our streets, contributing to our city's architecture, and becoming an integral part of our daily life.

Remember attending the Wine and Dine Festival, such a successful comeback under the able leadership of Anthony Lau here, this past October with a glass of wine in your hand while enjoying the glittering Victoria Harbour nightscape? Or taking your little ones to the world's first ""WATER PARADE at Victoria Harbour"" concluded in early November to greet globally renowned IP characters such as Doraemon; KAWS and Sesame Street's Elmo; McDonald's Grimace; and Labubu, a popular creation by a Hong Kong artist that has now become a global phenomenon? Or enjoying a cool picnic at Symphony Under the Stars, the iconic annual outdoor music extravaganza presented by the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra with generous support from Swire Pacific Limited just last week?

Such good memories have people longing for more, and we have indeed planned to stage more heartwarming events over the festive season. Of course, as a society, Hong Kong's priority at this juncture is doing all we can to bring comfort to the aggrieved, as well as to bravely confront the aftermath of the fire, including electing a new legislature that would work wholeheartedly with the Government on disaster relief and essential reforms on the coming Sunday. And of course, healing of physical wounds and the heartstrings takes a lot of time and much more care. But I hope that, for those in society who could use a drop of light, both literally and emotionally, the Christmas lightings that would be lit-up later this month under Hong Kong WinterFest could bring some warmth and comfort in a chilly season. 

With Hong Kong's diverse offerings, we welcomed some 45 million visitors in the first 11 months of this year, already surpassing the entire of 2024. This is a 12 per cent increase year on year. Visitors from the UK (United Kingdom) grew even more significantly, by 15 per cent, meaning our long-haul visitors are actually coming back, thanks to mega events, but also thanks to an increase in air flight capacity.

Beyond economic benefits, mega events allow people to experience the real and authentic Hong Kong firsthand. Visitors become our best ambassadors, telling Hong Kong's good stories far and wide. As someone familiar with and care deeply about Hong Kong, which is all of you here, I sincerely encourage you to invite your friends to explore the real Hong Kong and the opportunities here. I have spoken enough about sports and entertainment, and I would like to mention that with the strong participation of British artists, Hong Kong's cultural offerings in the coming months are equally attractive. A few examples are Sir John Eliot Gardiner conducting the Constellation Choir and Orchestra at the 54th Hong Kong Arts Festival, and the ""Wildlife Photographer of the Year"" exhibition at the Hong Kong Science Museum in collaboration with the Natural History Museum, London, not to mention the highly anticipated annual mega art and creative events of Art Basel, Art Central and ComplexCon.

Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is globally acclaimed as an international financial centre. This is, of course, absolutely true and important. In good times or bad, Hong Kong is always a city full of dynamic energy, and a vibrant and unique blend of East and West. But in closing, I hope to drive home this equally important message: as it is stated in 1 Corinthians 13:13, ""these three remain: faith, hope, and love, but the greatest of these is love"". Let us remember this and live out this spirit in full!

Thank you very much."

陳旭東廳長（廣東省司法廳廳長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

早上好。今日，我將會以「香港國際法律樞紐 — 中外企業的優選夥伴」為題，分享香港如何憑藉獨特優勢，成為助力國內企業走出去、外國企業引進來的首選夥伴。

根據《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港競爭力排名全球第三，其中在商業法規方面排名世界第一，營商效率方面排名世界第二，充分反映商界對香港法治環境、司法獨立、金融系統穩健、營商環境便利等優勢的認可。

香港有亞太區國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的策略性定位，在《2025年法治指數》中位列全球第24，在廉潔及監管執法範疇的排名均較去年提升，反映香港健全的監管架構與執法體系備受肯定，能夠為企業提供穩定且可預期的營商環境。

我們將致力推出精準的政策措施，鞏固香港的「超級聯繫人」與「超級增值人」的角色。

一、 助力內地企業出海

內地不同地區有各自的優勢產業與優質企業，具備國際化的創新水平和競爭優勢，有能力開拓更多海外市場。企業在出海過程中會衍生對國際化專業服務的需求。

香港的國際化專業服務正好配合國家所需，協助內地出海企業開拓安全航道，發揮香港「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的作用。香港專業服務界別亦可善用與內地企業「抱團出海」的龐大商機，增強發展動能，實現共贏。

今年《施政報告》明確指出香港要發揮好出海平台的功能，協助企業開拓海外新興市場。除了由商務及經濟發展局於十月成立的內地企業出海專班，我亦專責推廣香港法律服務，並協同其他專業如會計、金融等，為內地出海企業提供全方位支援。

我們將聚焦法律和其他專業服務的推廣，同時加強與其他政府部門及專業服務界別的溝通與協作，主動對接中國內地企業，掌握市場需求，並整合專業服務提供者資訊，包括匯整和發布涉及不同專業領域的成功出海個案供企業參考，推動企業和專業服務的交流與配對。

二、 推動大灣區的機制對接和規則銜接

我們將持續推動大灣區機制規則銜接，加強企業參與大灣區跨境民商事活動的法律保障。

現時，香港與內地簽署了九項民商事司法協助，涵蓋範圍很廣，例如對民商事法院判決和仲裁結果的承認和執行等。為深化內地與香港法律機制互聯互通，我們會繼續優化兩地民商事司法協作，如跟進落實執行法院民商事判決的安排，強化跨境法律保障，讓中外企業更有效地處理跨境法律爭議。

而且，自今年二月，「港資港法」與「港資港仲裁」措施已擴展到更多內地城市。「港資港法」目前適用於深圳和珠海，「港資港仲裁」除內地自貿區外，也適用於大灣區內地九市。擴展後，只要港資企業在相關城市登記設立，不論投資比例，均可受惠。

中外企業可透過在大灣區內地九市設立港資企業，在合同中約定適用與國際商業慣例接軌的香港普通法，以可預期的適用法律管控企業風險；並可選擇香港為仲裁地，透過香港成熟的仲裁制度，處理出海過程中遇上的爭議。

我們將積極推動灣區建立多元爭議解決機制，為內地企業「借港出海」及外資企業「借港登陸」提供法律保障。律政司與廣東省及澳門特區的法律部門一直努力合作，推動訂立仲裁調解程序以及人才的「灣區標準」，銜接三地的仲調機制。

仲裁方面，三地持續推動建立大灣區仲裁員名冊，並於今年七月共同發布工作指引和開展本地推薦程序，力求在今年年底前公布首批大灣區仲裁員名單，為大灣區注入更多仲裁人才。

調解方面，粵港澳大灣區法律部門聯席會議先後通過及發布《粵港澳大灣區調解員資格資歷評審標準》、《粵港澳大灣區調解員專業操守最佳準則》和《粵港澳大灣區跨境爭議調解示範規則》；三地亦已於今年第四季再次開展大灣區調解員本地評審，並在今年年底公布更新的大灣區調解員名冊。

未來，我們將進一步推動設立大灣區商事調解及仲裁平台，匯聚大灣區內的調解及仲裁機構採用和推廣「灣區標準」，降低企業解決跨境爭議的成本。

三、 促進法律人才交流與能力建設

香港國際法律人才培訓學院自去年成立以來，與多個國家部委和國際組織合作在香港及海外舉辦多項能力建設項目。例如學院獲國務院國有資產監督管理委員會政策法規局支持，於今年十月在香港舉辦中國企業出海法律實務培訓班，有30多位中央企業法律顧問及專業人士參加，探討中國企業出海面臨的法律問題及挑戰，有助中國企業「走出去」。

剛才，林定國司長在開幕致辭時跟大家介紹過，有賴司法部的大力支持，現在港澳居民內地律師及大灣區律師可代理的涉港澳民事案件範圍，擴大至299種民事案件。此舉有助港澳居民律師和大灣區律師更好發揮獨特專業優勢，融入國家發展大局。我們會配合相關政策，繼續為香港法律業界在內地，尤其是大灣區內地九市的發展提供支援。

成果豐碩

根據《世界經濟自由度2025年度報告》，香港再次蟬聯全球最自由經濟體，香港公司註冊和境外進駐香港的公司數目亦創新高，香港全年IPO（首次公開招股）集資也重返全球第一。具公信力的國際排名和客觀數據，反映香港特區政府積極吸引企業、資金和人才來港的措施效果顯著。

面對複雜多變的全球局勢，香港將繼續積極融入國家發展大局，致力發揮我們內聯外通的優勢。謝謝各位。"

The SSNS provides funding support to local sports organisations for promoting new sports on an individual project basis. Each successful applicant sports organisation will be offered a subvention not exceeding $200,000, or 85 per cent of the total eligible expenditure of an individual activity, whichever is the lower.

Sports organisations should fulfil all of the following requirements to be eligible applicants:


An applicant must be a non-profit-making organisation with Articles of Association registered as a company limited by guarantee under the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622);
The new sport under application must be distinct from those sports/disciplines currently solely governed by national sports associations under the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China;

For enquiries, please contact the Sports Funding Office of the LCSD at 2601 8756 or email ssns@lcsd.gov.hk. Please visit the LCSD's website (www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/programmes/programmeslist/sss/ssns.html) for details."
Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected cannabis buds at airport (with photo) ,2025-12-05 12:00,2025-12-05 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/05/P2025120500298.htm,"Hong Kong Customs yesterday (December 4) detected a drug trafficking case involving baggage concealment at Hong Kong International Airport and seized about 13 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with an estimated market value of about $2.6 million.

A 24-year-old male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds in his check-in baggage. The man was subsequently arrested.

The arrested man has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, and he will appear at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (December 6).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

CFS announces Second Hong Kong Total Diet Study findings on perchlorate,2025-12-05 11:55,2025-12-05 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/05/P2025120500271.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department released the third report under the Second Hong Kong Total Diet Study (2nd HKTDS) today (December 5). This report is the CFS's first assessment of the overall dietary exposure to perchlorate in food among the Hong Kong population. The findings showed that the estimated dietary exposures to perchlorate for the overall adult and younger populations in Hong Kong remain well below the health-based guidance values established by the international organisation/authority and do not pose a health risk.

Perchlorate occurs naturally in the environment and is also an environmental contaminant arising from human activities. Perchlorate has been reported to occur in a wide range of foods including vegetables, fruits, milk and dairy products. Perchlorate has low acute oral toxicity in laboratory animals, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer has not classified perchlorate as a carcinogen. Exposure to excessive perchlorate can interfere with thyroid function by reducing the uptake of iodide by the thyroid gland, leading to hypothyroidism. The CFS selected perchlorate as one of the testing parameters in the 2nd HKTDS to assess the local situation and evaluate the dietary exposure to perchlorate of the Hong Kong population in light of the attention that perchlorate has received abroad in earlier years.

Out of a total of 187 food items tested in the Study, 144 (77 per cent) were found to contain perchlorate. Among these food items, pumpkin exhibited the highest mean concentration of perchlorate, followed by Chinese amaranth and Chinese parsley. By combining the aforesaid findings with the food consumption data of people in Hong Kong, the estimated dietary exposures to perchlorate for average and high consumers of the adult and younger population were all below 5 per cent of the Provisional Maximum Tolerable Daily Intake of 10 micrograms/kilogram body weight allocated by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations/World Health Organisation Expert Committee on Food Additives for perchlorate.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The public is encouraged to maintain a balanced and varied diet to support overall health and reduce the risk of exposure to contaminants, including perchlorate, from a limited range of food.""

The 2nd HKTDS aims to estimate the latest dietary exposure of the Hong Kong population and various population subgroups to some chemical substances of potential food safety concern and assess the associated health risks. The public can download the relevant study reports released thus far from the CFS webpage at www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_firm/programme_tds_2nd_HKTDS_report.html."

高氯酸鹽在環境中天然存在，同時也是人類活動所產生的環境污染物。不同種類的食物，包括蔬菜、水果、奶類及乳類製品，均含有高氯酸鹽。高氯酸鹽在實驗動物身上的急性口服毒性低，而國際癌症研究機構也沒有把高氯酸鹽列為致癌物。攝入過量高氯酸鹽可減少甲狀腺對碘化物的攝取，影響甲狀腺功能，引致甲狀腺功能減退。由於高氯酸鹽早年曾受外地關注，為了評估本港情況並估算本地人口對高氯酸鹽的膳食攝入量，中心選定高氯酸鹽為第二次總膳食研究的檢測項目之一。

這次研究共檢測187種食物，其中144種（77%）檢出高氯酸鹽。當中南瓜的高氯酸鹽平均含量最高，其次是莧菜和芫茜。綜合檢測結果及港人的食物消費量資料，攝入量一般和攝入量高的成年人和較年輕群組每日從膳食攝入高氯酸鹽的分量均低於聯合國糧食及農業組織／世界衞生組織食品添加劑為高氯酸鹽暫定最高每日可容忍攝入量（每日每公斤體重10微克）的百分之五。

中心發言人說：「市民宜遵從基本的健康飲食建議，保持均衡多元的飲食，以減低因偏食而攝入某些污染物（包括高氯酸鹽）的風險。」

香港第二次總膳食研究評估香港市民和不同人口組別從膳食攝入一些可能有潛在食物安全風險的化學物質的分量，以及評估攝入該些物質對健康帶來的風險。市民可從中心網頁下載已公布的相關研究報告www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_firm/programme_tds_2nd_HKTDS_report.html。"

海關早前於購物熱點巡查期間，發現旺角有固定小販攤檔售賣懷疑冒牌物品。經調查後，海關人員於上述期間採取執法行動，掃蕩21個位於通菜街的固定小販攤檔，以及附近一間樓上冒牌物品貯存倉庫，檢獲一批懷疑冒牌物品，包括手袋、皮具和首飾。

行動中，海關拘捕一男四女，年齡介乎23歲至56歲。案件仍在調查中。

聖誕及新年假期將至，海關會繼續加強巡查和執法，嚴厲打擊各類售賣冒牌物品活動，全力保障本地消費者及訪港旅客的權益。

海關提醒本地消費者及訪港旅客應光顧信譽良好的店鋪，如有懷疑，應先向有關商標持有人或其代理商查詢。海關亦提醒商戶切勿出售冒牌物品，於採購物品時亦應小心謹慎，因售賣冒牌物品屬嚴重罪行，須負上刑責。

根據《商品說明條例》，任何人銷售或為售賣用途而管有冒牌物品，即屬違法。一經定罪，最高可被判罰款50萬元及監禁五年。

Customs earlier conducted patrols at popular shopping spots and discovered some fixed-pitch hawker stalls in Mong Kok selling suspected counterfeit goods. After investigations, Customs officers took enforcement action during the abovementioned period and raided 21 fixed-pitch hawker stalls on Tung Choi Street and a nearby storage site for counterfeit goods upstairs. A batch of suspected counterfeit goods, including handbags, leather goods, and accessories, was seized.

During the operation, Customs arrested one man and four women, aged between 23 and 56. An investigation is ongoing.

With Christmas and New Year holidays approaching, Customs will continue to step up inspection and enforcement to vigorously combat different kinds of counterfeit goods activities in order to safeguard local consumers' and visitors' rights at full strength.

Customs appeals to local consumers and visitors to purchase goods at reputable shops and to check with the trademark owners or their authorised agents if the authenticity of a product is in doubt. Customs also reminds traders not to sell counterfeit goods and to be cautious and prudent in merchandising since selling counterfeit goods is a serious crime and offenders are liable to criminal sanctions.

Under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, any person who sells or possesses for sale any goods with a forged trademark commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

Members of the public may report any suspected counterfeiting activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

The first case involved a metal frame on and over a canopy at the common area of an industrial building on Castle Peak Road, Sham Shui Po. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD and was convicted and fined $89,080 in total, of which $83,080 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued.

The second case involved a flat roof structure with an area of about 11.5 square meters of a composite building on Reclamation Street, Mong Kok. As the UBWs were carried out without prior approval and consent from the BD, a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD and was convicted and fined $74,590 in total, of which $64,590 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued.

The third case involved an alteration of a mini-storage unit in an industrial building on Bute Street, Mong Kok. As the alteration and addition works obstructed the means of escape and means of access for fire fighting and rescue, contravening the Building (Planning) Regulations, a removal order and a repair order were served on the owner under section 24(1) and section 26 of the BO respectively. Failing to comply with the statutory orders, the owner was prosecuted by the BD and was convicted and fined $69,760 in total, of which $57,760 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued.

The fourth case involved alteration of protected lobby at the front staircase of two composite buildings on Sai Yeung Choi Street South, Mong Kok. As the alteration works affected the fire-resisting construction of the buildings, contravening the Building (Construction) Regulation, two removal orders were served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal orders, the owner was prosecuted by the BD and was convicted and fined $57,200 in total, of which $48,200 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued.

A spokesman for the BD said today (December 5), ""UBWs, including the unauthorised alterations causing obstruction to the means of escape and means of access for firefighting and rescue, or affecting the fire-resisting construction of a building, may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues. Moreover, failure to comply with a repair order without reasonable excuse is also a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of level 5 ($50,000 at present) and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $5,000 for each day that the offence continues."

尊敬的陳旭東廳長（廣東省司法廳廳長）、各位領導、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

各位早安。我代表香港特別行政區政府律政司，感謝大家來到香港法律周2025的最後一天。今年，我們以「法匯香港聯通世界」為主題，見證香港國際法律樞紐的領先地位。

昨天適逢國家憲法日，我們特意舉辦《基本法》頒布35周年法律高峰論壇，闡明《憲法》是國家的根本大法，與《基本法》共同構成香港特區的憲制基礎，為香港繁榮穩定和國際法律樞紐的地位，提供根本保障。

在國家支持和香港各界努力下，香港再次獲評為全球最自由經濟體，並在《全球金融中心指數》中高踞第三，反映了國際社會對香港地位的肯定。

法匯香港聯通世界

透過法律周，我們匯聚了本地及國際法律精英，探討法律創新實踐與國際合作方向，進一步提升香港國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位，真正做到「法匯香港聯通世界」。

法律周由周一的第六屆聯合國國際貿易法委員會亞太司法峰會2025展開序幕，包括就數字化貿易融資和數字資產，以及貿法會國際法律文書應用等作出探討。第二天的司法圓桌會議吸引了來自中亞、東盟及太平洋島嶼等20多個司法管轄區的40多名法官和司法人員到場，連同過百名參與者在線上線下，就處理涉及人工智能的糾紛及替代爭議解決方式與法院訴訟程序的互動作交流。第三屆融通與發展法治論壇則環繞國際性議題，包括全球治理倡議及多邊主義對國際法治的重要，以及新興科技對國際法的促進和發展。

第三天的海牙國際私法會議亞太區域辦事處國際私法研討會，匯聚來自亞太區域不同地方的講者就海牙公約下跨國訴訟與認證進行討論。同日「調解之都」論壇探討調解在解決國家間爭端和國際投資爭端的成效，以及政府於深化調解文化措施的最新發展。而在2025年香港調解講座，大韓民國的專家分析了調解在娛樂產業爭議解決的機遇。

值得一提的是，首屆香港法律科技節亦在法律周舉行，聚焦法律科技與人工智能的融合，活動包括法律科技展覽及今日下午時段的法律科技主題論壇，探討科技與律師在法律實務中的相輔相成，發掘法律科技的巨大潛力。

首屆粵港澳大灣區律師論壇及粵港澳大灣區律師聯會正式成立

大灣區發展潛力巨大，是香港未來發展的關鍵。今日上午舉行主題為「灣區聯通揚帆遠航」的首屆粵港澳大灣區律師論壇，吸引了超過600名線上和線下參與者；三地法律智慧將一同探索灣區法治合作路向，共創融合發展新篇章。

律政司副司長張國鈞博士會於首場主題演講，介紹律政司為強化香港「超級聯繫人」與「超級增值人」角色、助力企業出海所推出的措施。隨後四位重量級嘉賓亦會發表主題演講：廣東省司法廳陳旭東廳長將介紹廣東省落實國家對港澳法律服務開放政策的情況和發展方向；香港律師會會長和香港大律師公會代表將從執業者角度，剖析大灣區律師制度和爭議解決實務的發展；廣東省高級人民法院法官將從內地司法角度，探討港澳企業法律選擇權的議題。主題論壇環節則由法律界領軍人物就企業出海涉及的法律議題作分享。

在中央政府支持下，港澳法律執業者在大灣區內地九市執業的試點工作已延長至明年十月。首五屆大灣區律師執業考試順利舉行，至今，超過630名港澳法律執業者通過考試並取得執業證。隨着報考大灣區考試的執業經歷門檻降低至三年，越來越多年輕律師加入，為大灣區律師隊伍注入生力軍。

兩日前，司法部亦發布公告，將取得內地法律職業資格並獲得內地律師執業證書的港澳居民內地律師及大灣區律師可代理的涉港澳民事案件範圍，從原有五大類237項擴闊至九大類299種民事案件，包括不正當競爭糾紛、海事海商糾紛等，進一步回應港澳律師拓展業務的需求，為法律服務市場創造更多機遇。

大灣區律師具備雙重執業資格，熟悉內地與香港的法律體系和商業文化，能精準拿捏客戶需求，同時具備國際視野，熟悉普通法思維，提供貼地和與國際接軌的法律服務。他們尤其能回應區內外企業對法律人才的殷切需求，助力國内企業出海、國外企業開拓內地市場，發揮大灣區「一國兩制三法域」的獨特優勢。

今日除了匯聚大灣區律師探討法律熱點議題，我亦邀請各位共同見證粵港澳大灣區律師聯會的正式成立。

去年我們發布《粵港澳大灣區法治建設行動綱領》，其中將推動設立專屬大灣區律師的組織平台列為重點任務之一，在《行政長官2024年施政報告》中也明確提出相關措施，可見特區政府及律政司對推動大灣區法律人才隊伍建設的高度重視。

非常感謝司法部和廣東省司法廳大力支持，以及中國法律服務（香港）有限公司為此做的大量準備工作。我期望聯會凝聚香港大灣區律師的專業力量，助力大灣區律師專業發展，以及持續檢視並提出優化大灣區律師執業制度的建議。我們期待與聯會緊密合作，共同推動灣區律師試點工作，為大灣區律師制度恆常化創造有利條件，貢獻國家涉外法治建設。

最後，衷心感謝我的同事、各支持機構，所有講者和主持人，以及每一位參加者，你們的參與是法律周成功的關鍵。我亦預祝今日的活動圓滿成功。謝謝。"

Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-04 23:44,2025-12-05 00:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400905.htm,"  The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

  For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received have reached $2.5 billion as of noon today (December 4). In addition to the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $2.8 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

  The Government earlier announced that the Support Fund will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 67 cases have been processed, and disbursements are under way. In addition, the Government announced that the Support Fund will provide a living allowance of $50,000 to each affected household. As of today, 674 cases have been processed, and disbursements are ongoing. The Government today further announced that the living allowance is increased from $50,000 to $100,000.

  In addition, the Government has so far disbursed an emergency subsidy of $10,000 to 1 929 households.

  Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 700 affected households so far to register them for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. SWD staff also paid a visit to the affected residents staying in transitional housing units in Yuen Long today, and distributed Octopus cards with a face value of $2,000 to facilitate their daily travels and address their imminent needs. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government. Those not yet in touch with the SWD are advised to leave their contact information by calling 182 183 as soon as possible.

  To further strengthen support for those affected by the Tai Po fire, under the directive of the Financial Secretary’s co-ordination meeting with the financial regulators, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Association of Banks today met again with 28 retail banks (including digital banks) and introduced additional measures to continue assisting those affected with a compassionate approach and flexible arrangements. For more details, please refer to the HKMA's press release.

Accommodation support
------------------------------

  As of this morning, a total of 1 241 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 2 235 residents have moved into transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society. Moreover, the Tai Po District Office continues to operate a temporary shelter at Tai Po Community Centre, which remains open to residents in need. The other temporary shelter at Tung Cheong Street Community Hall will remain in operation until the existing users have relocated to arranged emergency accommodations.

  The Transport Department (TD) has been steering public transport operators to strengthen services of franchised buses, green minibuses and residents' services by deploying additional vehicles and manpower to support residents affected by the fire who have been admitted into transitional housing in various districts, allowing them to connect with other services to commute between different districts. The TD will continue to maintain close liaison with operating organisations of the transitional housing projects concerned and public transport operators to cater for residents' commuting needs.

Relief supplies and donations
------------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform (www.taipodonation.hk), established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 300 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, beddings, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents’ actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, Government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items to places in need in phases. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Handling of reported missing persons
------------------------------------------

  The Police have completed searches inside all seven buildings. Today, around 300 officers from the Disaster Victim Identification Unit conducted searches around the buildings and near the collapsed scaffolding, which had been confirmed as safe. No human remains were found, and the number of the deceased remains at 159. The officers also handed over suspected human remains found earlier to forensic pathologists for further testing. The Police will continue to follow up on the reported missing persons, aiming to confirm their status and the number of casualties as soon as possible.

Investigations
----------------

  The Inter-departmental Fire Investigation Task Force, led by the Fire Services Department and joined by the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, investigated the oil gas pipeline on the exterior wall at the initially confirmed fire location and found no damage to the pipeline.

Regulation and inspection work
-----------------------------------

  The Housing Bureau has arranged emergency maintenance contractors to help the Police start clearing away miscellaneous items at the surroundings of the buildings starting today. At the same time, further support works have commenced in the small number of units which may be subject to more damage.

  The Independent Checking Unit of the Housing Bureau visited the four Home Ownership Scheme courts, namely Sui Wo Court in Sha Tin, Ching Lai Court in Sham Shui Po, Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po, and On Kay Court in Kwun Tong, as well as Fung Wah Estate in Chai Wan under the Tenants Purchase Scheme to oversee the work and progress on the removal of protective nets carried out by the registered contractors. The Housing Department has also completed the removal of the protective nets in 15 public housing estates today.

Following the Development Bureau’s announcement yesterday (December 3) that any scaffold nets installed on external walls of all public and private buildings, as well as government buildings undergoing major repair works, must be immediately removed, and the works at the external walls must cease, the Buildings Department (BD) and relevant government departments have issued orders to contractors today, requiring them to complete the removal on or before this Saturday (December 6). Before and after the removal of scaffold nets, the contractors must ensure that there are no materials or loose items on the scaffolding, and that the scaffolding is safely secured to ensure public safety. Some contractors have commenced the removal and for individual cases that require more handling time, the contractor should notify the relevant department in advance, which will assess whether there are reasonable grounds for discretionary arrangements.

The BD aims to issue a new code of practice next week, requiring all scaffold net materials to be sampled on-site. The scaffold nets can only be installed after being certified by designated laboratories as compliant with relevant requirements.

Moreover, relevant departments inspected existing buildings undergoing major external wall maintenance earlier and took samples for testing from buildings with scaffold nets installed. The BD has taken samples from 400 private buildings with scaffold nets installed and sent them for testing in batches. The Architectural Services Department has also inspected all 18 of its public works building projects and collected samples for testing.

  The Labour Department (LD) continues to inspect fire protection facilities and the fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding to ensure the occupational safety of workers. As of 4pm today, the LD has inspected 239 construction sites, issued a total of 130 written warnings and 61 improvement notices, and taken out 17 prosecutions."
Banking industry introduces additional emergency measures to support affected individuals of Tai Po fire,2025-12-04 23:40,2025-12-04 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400886.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

To provide further assistance to the individuals affected by the Tai Po fire, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) today (December 4) met again with 28 retail banks, including digital banks, to review the effectiveness of previously introduced emergency measures and explore additional support initiatives. The banking industry remains committed to offering timely and appropriate assistance to affected individuals in an empathetic and flexible manner.

As part of the six emergency support measures launched by the HKMA and HKAB last Friday (November 28), all retail banks have set up respective dedicated 24-hour hotlines, provided a six-month pre-approved repayment grace period, and prioritised the handling of bank account matters and document replacements for affected individuals.

Today, the banking industry announces five additional measures listed below:

1. Expedite the handling of the deceased's bank accounts and safe deposit boxes – The HKMA is establishing a collaboration mechanism with the banking industry and relevant government departments to assist family members in expediting the handling of bank accounts and safe deposit boxes of the deceased. At the same time, the banking industry will strengthen the protection of such accounts to guard against unauthorised withdrawals and other fraudulent activities.

2.Provide credit support and flexible arrangement for affected individuals – To alleviate the liquidity pressure on affected individuals, the following support measures will be introduced:

Offer emergency interest-free or low-interest loans – Major retail banks will introduce their respective emergency interest-free or low-interest loans for affected individuals, offering a deferred payment period of the first six months and a service charge waiver. For details, please refer to the respective terms and conditions of each individual bank.
Expand the coverage of credit support measures — In addition to affected residents, credit support measures will also apply to construction workers, cleaning workers, and security guards who were injured or passed away in the incident, as well as their family members, to alleviate their financial pressure.
Closely follow up on mortgage arrangements — The HKMA and HKAB will continue to work closely with the banking industry regarding follow-up arrangements for the mortgages of affected residents, adopting an empathetic and flexible approach in handling each case, including relevant legal matters, insurance claims, and arrangements for building repairs or reconstruction. The banking industry is currently providing a six-month pre-approved repayment grace period (including principal and interest) for relevant mortgages to alleviate the immediate financial pressure on affected residents, while giving them and relevant parties time and room to manage these issues.


3.Help affected residents exchange damaged banknotes and coins flexibly – The three note-issuing banks (NIBs), namely The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, and Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited, will provide a one-stop service to assist affected residents in verifying and exchanging notes and coins issued by any NIBs or the Government that were damaged in the fire, after the affected buildings are unblocked. Affected residents are advised not to repair damaged notes or coins on their own. They are advised to keep the damaged notes and coins in their current state, and take them to the NIBs' branches for exchange, along with the affected residents' identification proof.

4.No bank fees for fund transfers to and from the ""Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po""account – All retail banks will not charge any fees for all fund transfers to and from the ""Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po""account set up by the Government. This includes both making donations to and receiving subsidies from the Fund.

5.Continue to extend branch service hours in Tai Po – All retail banks will continue to extend the opening hours of their branches in Tai Po, providing services from 9am to 5pm on December 6 (Saturday), and from 9am to 1pm on December 7 (Sunday).

The HKMA and HKAB have noted that fraudsters are exploiting the Tai Po fire to defraud. The HKMA and HKAB have been maintaining close communication with the Police while reminding the banking industry and the public to stay vigilant. At the meeting, the Police were invited to share the latest modus operandi of deception arising from the fire incident. The banking industry has already stepped up surveillance and anti-fraud measures accordingly, including exercising extra vigilance for applications of change of residential or correspondence addresses to Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po after the fire, and cooperating with Police investigations. Whenever receiving calls that are claimed to be from banks, the public should authenticate the identity of the caller and never disclose personal or bank account information, passwords, or other sensitive information to suspicious individuals."
​民政及青年事務局局長會見傳媒答問內容（只有中文）,2025-12-04 22:40,2025-12-04 22:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400784.htm,"民政及青年事務局（民青局）局長麥美娟今日（十二月四日）到「啟航1331」探訪大埔宏福苑火災受影響居民後會見傳媒。以下是麥美娟的答問內容：

記者：局長你好，想問現在還有多少未獲長期安置的居民呢？還有未來「啟航1331」會不會變成長期安置受影響居民的地方？現在有多少位災民入住了「啟航1331」？另外你有提到會增加「啟航1331」往大埔的穿梭巴士，但其實這個地點不是那麼方便，未來會否增加除了去大埔之外，或者從這裏去市區的穿梭巴士？會不會增加一些生活上的配套？

民政及青年事務局局長：對於居民的安置問題，首先短期方面，我們要馬上令到他們起碼有一個房間可以休息。多謝很多業界朋友的熱心，在火警發生當晚我們已籌集了超過1 000個房間，現在更已有2 000多個房間，供受影響居民短期暫住。入住約兩至三星期後，剛才也提到，要解決長期住屋問題是需要時間，我們要在這段時間幫他們找到一個地方居住，所以稍後都會安排他們遷至過渡屋。住在過渡屋的居民數字為大約2 000多人，住在酒店或青年宿舍的居民大約有500多戶，共有1 000多人。我們希望陸續為居民解決住宿的需要。

大家都很關心居民住進短暫住宿後，不單只是「啟航1331」，我留意到大家都會問，那些設施究竟是否足夠等。大家可以看到，其實在很短時間內，各界已經馬上動起來，在各自的範圍或他們可以提供的措施上馬上提供協助。居民現在最急切的需要可能是想回到大埔，可能要處理一些事務等，所以營運者馬上安排穿梭巴士方便居民。居民在居住期間有甚麼需要，我們一定會按照他們的需要來增加不同的設施。正如大家現在看到，街坊大家本來都認識的，搬到一個新環境，大家希望可以有個地方聊聊天，抒發感情，以及在鄰里之間互相支持。所以（營運者）馬上設了一個客廳，並逐步增加一些設施，令到居民住在這裏時，都可以有一些鄰里之間的支援，感受到社區給他們的支援。我們會陸陸續續按居民的需要提供不同措施。總而言之，在短期住宿和長期住宿，政府都會確保受火災影響的市民能夠得到解決，而且不會收取費用。在這期間，我們會有長期持續的關顧。如果居民有新需要，我們都會提出新措施和服務滿足他們。

記者：想關心一下，這次火災衍生了一些全港樓宇維修的問題，是否反映民青局在支援法團進行大維修、一些採購，或者是在大廈管理方面，出現了一些疏忽呢？會不會認為是過分地將一些責任拋給法團呢？其實民青局有沒有人失職呢？有沒有人要問責？或者會不會檢討現行機制呢？

民政及青年事務局局長：如果大家記得，各位了解和關心物業管理方面工作，應該都會知道，今屆政府就着物業管理方面的工作，提出了很多不同措施。首先，我們在二○二三年提出修訂物業管理條例，即《建築物管理條例》（第344章），這工作在社會討論了十多年，一直都未能在立法會討論，當然有很多不同的原因。最終在今屆政府上任後，我們第一件事就是完善這條法例。我們在二○二四年得到立法會的支持，通過了《2024年建築物管理（修訂）條例》。這個修訂的內容，關心物業管理工作方面的朋友都會知道，我們要求釐清大維修的定義是甚麼，如果在大維修的會議開業主大會時，需要出席的人數和要求親身出席，即是說業主不只是靠收授權，是需要有一定比例的親身出席，亦都強化了利益申報的制度，包括有關的法團成員，或是管理公司，或其他負責人等等。我們甚至加強了一些罰則，包括是否有妥善保存標書的文件等。這個法例在二○二四年通過之後，今年也生效了。我們希望透過完善了的法例，加強法團運作的透明度和負責任程度。畢竟，物業是屬於業主自己，他們必須有意識和責任管理好自己的物業。我們明白，業主不一定有專業知識。因此，《建築物管理條例》訂明，包括在招標、開業主大會等的要求。如果大家記得，民青局提及了很多次，這一次條例的修訂，不會就這樣停下來。我們在二○二四年的條例修訂，是追溯過去十多年都不能通過的修訂。在《2024年建築物管理（修訂）條例》通過之後，我們馬上說，《建築物管理條例》是需要有其他地方的修訂，包括民青局局長作為主管當局，在條例下，是不是應該可以有更大的權力去協助業主立案法團做管理的工作呢？簡單而言，一個主管當局，我想當時法例草擬時，可能考慮到始終是一個私人物業、私有產權，所以對於主管當局的權力是頗有限制的，包括我們不可以做一個仲裁的角色。很多仲裁的角色，或者要做一個決定，是要去到土地審裁處。我們去到土地審裁處都沒有一個捷徑，必須要跟其他業主同樣排隊等。我們多次提到，條例生效之後，我們已經打算做一系列關於條例的修訂，令到業主能夠有更清楚的法律規範，以及令到主管當局能夠有更大權力，協助業主立案法團做好物業管理。當新一屆立法會上任後，我們馬上將建議修訂的方向和內容交給立法會討論，希望能夠盡快做好完善法例的工作。

在法例法規之外，大家如果有參與過業主立案法團工作，也可感受到今屆政府、民青局和民政事務總署團隊在支援業主做好物業管理方面的工作，我們做了更積極的角色。媒體也有報道有一些法團成員特別提出，透過民政事務處提供的協助，在開會議時，給了他們一些意見。我們推出了「聯廈聯管」，也加強了對法團支援的工作。行政長官《施政報告》也提及，接下來我們會在每一個區議會成立一個工作小組，即每一個區設樓宇管理工作小組。為甚麼我們要這樣做呢？就是要因應各區的特色和區情，透過區議會為業主提供更適切的支援，讓他們可以做好自己物業的樓宇管理工作。

記者：目前基金已經籌款總共有28億，請問現在用了多少？用了在哪方面呢？還有54戶災民登記了一萬元，但還未取，那會不會主動聯絡那些災民呢？怎樣可以確保他們全部都受助？局方說要研究長期住屋和居住問題，那有沒有一個方向呢？會安排些甚麼單位呢？那短期住宿方面又會怎樣處理呢？因為有居民說可能安排了住兩個星期酒店住宿，問酒店之後的安排，又得不到一個確實答案，兩個星期之後居民住宿有甚麼安排呢？甚麼時候會有時間表或答案給居民？

民政及青年事務局局長：首先澄清，混亂的資訊都需要靠各位朋友幫忙澄清。正如我剛才所說，一萬元應急補助金，有1 930戶登記，並已向1 929戶派發，即是只剩下一戶未派發。回答你的問題，我們會不會主動聯絡災民？我們當然有主動聯絡災民。如果我們不主動聯絡，怎樣能夠解決在短時間內派發一萬元現金。現時只剩下那戶未派發補助金，是因為他有其他需要，會有同事專門聯繫他。民政處的同事已經熬了多個通宵聯繫居民，希望確保一萬元應急錢能盡快發放到居民手上。

至於你說現在「大埔宏福苑援助基金」的28億元，我們用了多少錢？這一萬元應急補助金不是由援助基金撥出，因應當時情況緊急，我們很心急希望可以給居民這一萬元現金應急錢，所以當時我們調動了華人慈善基金，透過華人慈善基金撥款。我們派發一萬元予1 930戶，這1 900多萬並不是由援助基金撥出，而是透過華人慈善基金撥出現金，因為當時大家都知道，如果要待開帳戶後接受捐款才做，我們是等不到的，所以我們馬上調動基金撥出現金給居民。至於用了多少錢便要算一算，我們現時大約用了1,000多萬，因為數目會每日更新，我想這是加減數，今日的數目仍待統計，我舉例截至昨日下午四時，五萬元生活津貼已發放款項予326宗個案，20萬元慰問金及五萬元殮葬金已發放款項予52宗個案。所以大家可以自行計算，我不在這裏解釋。

關於短暫住屋方面，因為當晚我們不想居民在受到這麼大的衝擊後，還沒有一個好的地方休息，所以當晚我們動員，亦有很多機構主動提出，例如「啟航1331」提出可撥房間提供一個月住宿，有些酒店提出可提供一個月或兩個月住宿的房間，機構是按照本身營運情況提供住宿時間。正如我剛才所說，無論是短暫住宿或長期住宿，特區政府都會照顧，並且這段期間是不會收取費用。而且，如果大家有甚麼特別需要，例如我們探訪的一些家庭，老人家行動不太方便，如果住過渡屋需要住地下，這些情況大家可以跟登記了的「一戶一社工」提出。正如我剛才所說，「一戶一社工」已經完成1 000多戶的配對，社工每日會定期問候居民，大家接到社工電話時都不要客氣，有甚麼需要和幫助就說出來。探訪街坊時我真的很感動，街坊真的很好，我們問他們有甚麼需要，他們都說沒有，要留給其他人，這讓我們看到香港人都有互相關懷的精神。

但我也重申，大家不要客氣，如果真的有甚麼需要，譬如我們探望居民時，留意到他可能選擇住在地下那層比較好，這要跟社工說。現時我們最需要是甚麼？最需要是大家團結，亦最需要大家互相關懷。這個過程中，我們看到無論是政府團隊，又或是社會各界，包括我身旁的業界朋友，或者在地區裏不同的朋友，很多市民都出心，希望能夠幫助受影響的市民。因為這段路是需要長期持續走的，希望大家都是團結，陪着各個受影響的居民走這條路，讓他們可以重新過新生活。政府多次強調，我們必定會陪着所有居民走這條路，那怕當中會有挑戰和困難，但我們會一同克服。大家如有甚麼需要，可以隨時告訴我們，最重要是我們一起走好這條路。謝謝大家。"

運輸署持續督導公共運輸服務營辦商加強專營巴士、專線小巴和居民巴士服務，加派車輛和人手，支援入住各區過渡性房屋的火災居民，便利接駁其他服務往返各區。署方會繼續與相關過渡性房屋項目營運機構和公共運輸服務營辦商緊密協調，照顧居民的出行需要。

物資援助／捐獻
———————

政府與資訊科技業界構建的物資捐獻網上平台（www.taipodonation.hk）繼續運作，團體及市民可於平台登記可捐贈的物資。政府至今共收到超過1 300個登記，其中約三成由機搆提出，而餘下的由市民個人提出。已登記可捐獻物品種類涵蓋食品及飲品、衣物、日常生活用品、寢具、電器等多個類別。政府正透過相關政策局、政府部門和服務團體掌握居民的實際需要後進行物資配對工作，以便陸續把適用物資派送往有需要的地點。物資配對和分發工作會持續進行。

處理報稱失聯人士個案
——————————

警方已完成所有七幢大廈內部範圍的搜索工作。今日約300名「災難遇害者辨認組」人員在已確定安全的大廈外圍及倒塌棚架附近進行搜索，暫未有發現遺骸，死者數目維持159人。人員亦已將早前找到的懷疑人骨交予法醫作進一步檢測。警方會繼續跟進報稱失聯人士個案，務求盡快確認他們的情況及死傷人數。

調查工作
————

由消防處牽頭的跨部門調查專組聯同機電工程署人員，在初步確認的起火位置調查外牆的石油氣管道，並未有發現該管道有損壞的情況。

規管巡查
————

房屋局安排緊急維修承建商於今日開始協助警方清理樓宇外圍的雜物，亦同時開始對結構損壞較嚴重的小量單位進行進一步鞏固工程。

房屋局的獨立審查組實地查看四個居屋屋苑（包括沙田穗禾苑、深水埗清麗苑、深水埗怡閣苑及觀塘安基苑）和租置屋邨柴灣峰華邨的註冊承建商拆除屋苑內棚網的工作，監察有關進度。房屋署已於今日完成拆除15個公共屋邨的棚網。

繼發展局昨日（十二月三日）宣布所有正進行大維修而外牆設有棚網的公營、私人樓宇和政府大樓，須即時將棚網下架並停止外牆工程，屋宇署及相關政府部門今日已向承建商發出命令，要求他們在本周六（十二月六日）或之前完成棚網下架。移除棚網之前及之後，承建商必須確保棚架上無任何物料或鬆脫物，以及棚架安全穩固，以確保公眾安全。部分承建商已展開移除行動。如個別個案需要更多時間處理，須預先通報相關部門，以審視是否有合理理由可以作出通融。

屋宇署會爭取在下星期發出新的作業守則，要求所有棚網物料就地採樣，經過指定的檢測所檢測並確定合格後，才可以再上架。

此外，各有關部門早前巡查了正進行外牆大維修的現存樓宇，並向有棚網的樓宇取樣檢驗。屋宇署就400幢有棚網的私營樓宇抽取樣本，陸續分批送交測試，建築署亦已巡查轄下所有18個工務工程樓宇項目並取樣檢驗。

勞工處繼續巡查設有大型棚架的樓宇維修工程工地的防火設施及火災應變安排，以保障工人的職業安全。截至今日下午四時，勞工處已巡查239個建築地盤，共發出130份書面警告及61張敦促改善通知書，並提出17宗檢控。"
​民政及青年事務局局長會見傳媒開場發言（只有中文）,2025-12-04 21:34,2025-12-04 21:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400740.htm,"民政及青年事務局（民青局）局長麥美娟今日（十二月四日）到「啟航1331」探訪大埔宏福苑火災受影響居民後會見傳媒。以下是麥美娟的開場發言：

特區政府繼續全力跟進大埔宏福苑的支援、善後及調查的工作。政府的團隊連日來都在各個應急處所，包括由民青局協調的青年宿舍、營舍和酒店房間，以及房屋局的過渡性房屋等，探訪受火災影響的居民，了解他們的需要。社會福利署（社署）的社工也接觸了受影響的住戶，為居民登記「一戶一社工」的跟進服務，令他們可以更加掌握居民的需要。在我們連日來的探訪中，我們也了解居民現時的迫切需要，以及他們希望我們可以做甚麼幫助他們，我們明白居民在生活上有各樣的支援，尤其現在開始進入冬季，天氣開始冷，居民可能需要添置一些衣物等不同物資，所以我們決定，將上星期公布的每戶五萬元的生活津貼，增加到每戶10萬元。即是每一個受影響的住戶，在火災發生時住在宏福苑的居民，我們會將他的生活津貼增加到10萬元。

在我們的紀錄中，我們已經為300多戶提供了這個五萬元的生活津貼。大家可以放心，因為我們已經有他們的資料，我們會馬上將新增加的五萬元存入他們的戶口。而仍未領取生活津貼的家庭，我們會一次過發放10萬元的生活津貼。

至於有一些街坊還未跟社署社工登記的，請他們致電182 183登記，由社工去協助他們，不用到處奔波去問。致電182 183這個電話就可以，登記了就有社工會聯絡和配對他們。我們了解到「一戶一社工」的工作，之前登記了1,000多戶，現在陸陸續續每一戶登記了的家庭都已經配對了一個社工。社工會每日問候這些受影響的家庭，各位不用客氣，在和社工溝通的時候，即管告訴社工他們的擔心，或者他們的要求，或者他們想要怎樣的幫忙。譬如說這五萬元怎樣申請，這10萬元怎樣申請，這些社工都會幫忙。因為我們聽到坊間，有很多街坊在我們去探望的時候都說，很多機構有很多申請，不知怎樣申請。大家可以直接告訴社工，由社工去幫忙協調，一次過進行登記。

另外，為了便利入住了「啟航1331」青年驛站的居民往返大埔，「啟航1331」的營運者博盛文旅將會安排穿梭巴士，接載居民往返「啟航1331」和大埔區。稍後如果大家需要資料，我們請博盛文旅兩位負責人幫忙解釋。我們剛才也參觀過博盛文旅為「啟航1331」居民增加的設施，包括在設施裏面有社工的協助，有一些醫療團隊的協助。我們剛才也看到有一位伯伯，我們和他聊過天，他也表示很感謝有這樣的設施，但他們當然很需要情緒上的支援，所以在「啟航1331」裏，都有社工和義工，特別為他們提供一些支援和輔導。

另外，因應大埔宏福苑的大火，行政長官亦已指示所有政府部門要體恤宏福苑居民的需要，彈性處理相關的政府收費和賬單，為居民提供最大的支持。昨天公布一系列的措施，包括入境事務處會豁免居民補領證件的手續費；醫管局轄下的公立醫院的傷者，整個治療和復康過程所需的醫療服務，都是獲得全額費用豁免；食物環境衞生署會寬免提供骨灰安置及相關的服務費用，而昨天也特別提到，會寬免受影響業主和居民二○二四／二五課稅年度的應繳稅款餘額，和二○二五／二六課稅年度的暫繳稅款。換言之，各位是無需繳交就二○二四／二五課稅年度發出的稅單，另亦會為受影響的業主及居民代繳地租及寬免因火災而不能使用住宅的差餉；會豁免大埔宏福苑居民在今年七月至十一月的水費及排污費，即之前收的帳單全部不用付。中華電力有限公司會豁免受影響客戶十一月的電費，亦都向有關客戶盡快安排退還電力帳戶按金。而不同的電訊商亦都會為受影響客戶提供豁免服務費用、免費借用手機及免費電話儲值卡等支援。中石化（香港）石油氣有限公司亦都會豁免受影響客戶十一月的氣費。

由火災發生到現在，我們透過成立「大埔宏福苑援助基金」籌到的款項，截至今日中午已經籌得25億元，連同政府撥款的3億元，基金已經有28億元。由火災發生開始到現在我們為居民提供了各項支援，包括提供一萬元現金的應急補助金。我們已經向1,929戶派發，剩下數戶，現在正在聯絡中，都會安排給他們。另外，我們之前已經處理了674宗申請五萬元生活津貼的個案。剛才說了，這個生活津貼的金額是會增加到10萬元。而我們為了在這次火災中不幸過世的死者的家屬，就每名死者向家屬提供20萬元的慰問金和五萬元的殮葬金。到現在處理了67宗的個案，陸續發放有關慰問金。另外，受傷補助方面，受傷的市民如果留院七天以下的，就會有五萬元的受傷補助；如果留院七天或以上的，就會有10萬元的受傷補助。

同時我們透過教育局得知，很多學生都住在宏福苑，他們的書本、校服都被燒毀，所以我們會透過學校向就讀全日制中小學、幼稚園和大專的同學，發放兩萬元的學生補助。另外在宏福苑火警發生的時候，現場有不少工友，包括是建造業工友、清潔工或者是保安員，我們都會為工友提供兩萬元的補助。同時，在宏福苑有不少外籍家庭傭工在照顧居民的家庭，所以我們會為所有火警發生時，在宏福苑工作的外籍家庭傭工提供兩萬元的外籍家庭傭工補助。

至於剛才提到的「大埔宏福苑援助基金」，現時連同政府的撥款有28億元，捐款帳戶是中國銀行（香港），港元帳戶是012-875-2-190159-7，其他貨幣包括人民幣的帳戶號碼是012-875-2-190160-7；我們亦有轉數快，或可透過Alipay或WeChat Pay支付。我想提一提大家，請記得我們沒有製作任何QR Code（二維碼），所以如果有網上的人告訴你，可以透過一個QR Code去捐款，這一定是騙案。如果大家有心去支持這援助基金，請大家直接存款到這銀行戶口。關於捐款收據的問題，我們下星期初會有正式的公布，因為我們知道大家都很熱心捐款至這援助基金，但是請大家暫時保留銀行入數的資料，我們稍後會開始處理文書工作，向大家發放用作免稅的捐款收據，請大家留意相關公布。

我們還有一個物資捐獻網上平台。火警發生至今，我們很感謝很多市民捐贈物資給受影響的市民。為了令大家捐贈的物資能夠配對供受影響的市民使用，創新科技及工業局和資訊科技界的朋友一起構建了一個網上平台，就是www.taipodonation.hk。現時我們已經收到超過1,300個登記，其中約三成是由機構提出，其餘都是由市民個人提出。物資種類涵蓋食品、飲品、衣物、日常生活用品、寢具和電器等。我們會就大家的捐贈與受影響的市民作配對，實際上我們已完成了第一輪的物資配對，為一些已經遷入過渡屋的受影響市民提供相關物資。我們會陸續進行配對的工作，希望大家的捐贈的物資可以送到適合的災民手上。

截至昨日（十二月三日）已經有526戶，大約是1,241人，住進了由民青局統籌的青年宿舍和酒店，也有2,000多名居民已經遷入過渡性房屋。

還有一點，我們連日來去到不同的安置中心，無論是酒店、青年宿舍，或者過渡屋，由特首到司局長，或是義工和關愛隊，我們透過探訪了解受影響居民不同的需要。在我們的接觸中，除了剛才提到居民希望可以有更多的支援，所以我們將生活津貼由五萬元增加到10萬元，以及提供各項物資配對之外，還有一項大家最關心的問題，就是那單位，他們最貴重的資產，現在怎麼辦呢？所以我們想在這裏跟各位居民說，大家可以放心，特區政府也有想到這個問題。我們明白這過程不簡單，正正因為處理這問題的過程不簡單，所以需要政府的協助，政府是必須要幫忙的。所以在這方面，特首已經指示了財政司副司長領導的小組，研究居民的長期住屋和居住的問題，請居民放心，因為我們很明白大家的需要。正如我們多次強調，我們承諾長期持續陪着各位居民，大家一起克服不同的挑戰，令大家可以重過新生活。

最後也有一些資訊澄清，因為我們連日來探訪街坊的時候，也有很多人說，他們現在住在過渡屋，是不是免租三個月之後就要交租呢？有很多不同的傳言。我們有一個網站，就是www.taipofire.gov.hk，請大家在網站獲得正確的信息，包括政府會為受影響居民，無論是現在透過青年宿舍，或「啟航1331」，或酒店營運者提供的免費短暫住宿，又或是之後提供的過渡性房屋，入住期間都是不收費用的，直到大家能夠解決了長期的住屋問題，重過新生活為止。我在連日的探訪中了解到大家都有一些疑問，希望傳媒朋友可以幫我們將正確的信息告訴居民，令到他們不用太擔心。"
二○二五年「國家憲法日」座談會（附圖／短片）,2025-12-04 20:38,2025-12-04 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400614.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（十二月四日）聯同中央政府駐港聯絡辦公室合辦「國家憲法日」座談會，勵進教育中心為支持機構。座談會旨在讓社會各界加深認識國家和香港特區的憲制基礎。座談會開始前全場站立默哀一分鐘，悼念大埔宏福苑火災罹難者。

座談會的主題為「憲法與中華民族偉大復興」，行政長官李家超和中央政府駐港聯絡辦公室副主任劉光源分別致辭。及後，全國人大常委會香港基本法委員會委員、中國人民大學法學院韓大元教授發表主題演講。對談環節則由勵進教育中心理事會理事范徐麗泰主持，全國港澳研究會顧問劉兆佳教授，以及全國政協港澳台僑委員會委員李大壯分別發言。座談會共有約900名來自社會不同界別的人士參加出席。

李家超致辭時首先向大埔宏福苑火災罹難者致以深切哀悼，並向家屬及災民致以誠摯慰問。他表示特區政府正全力進行救災支援和善後工作，並將成立獨立委員會全方位審視事件，避免災難重演，回應市民期望。他說今次的悲痛教訓，將轉化為強化城市安全、改革制度的具體措施。

李家超表示，《憲法》為實現中華民族偉大復興提供最堅實的法治保障與制度支撐，亦是設立香港特區的憲制基礎。在民族復興的征程上，香港既是參與者，更是受益者。香港回歸28年來充分展現「一國兩制」的強大生命力和制度優越性，國際金融、航運、貿易中心地位穩固。他又指出，香港在未來必須做好三方面的角色和貢獻：必須維護《憲法》和《基本法》；必須更好融入和服務國家發展大局，掌握「十五五」規劃建議的國家發展方向和香港的機遇，鞏固提升國際金融、航運、貿易中心地位，建設國際創科中心，打造國際高端人才集聚高地，發展新質生產力；必須當好中華文化與世界各地文明交流的橋樑，講好「一國兩制」成功實踐的真實故事。最後，李家超呼籲各界共同將香港建設好、發展好，為中華民族偉大復興事業貢獻力量，以及在十二月七日踴躍投票，選出有抱負、有能力的立法會議員，與政府共同援助災民和推動改革，建設更美好的香港家園。

劉光源表示，《憲法》為實現中華民族偉大復興提供了法治保障；《憲法》為香港融入民族復興壯闊征程奠定了法律基礎；《憲法》為香港在民族復興偉業中發揮所長賦予了制度優勢。在《憲法》保駕護航下，今天的中國已經成為世界發展最穩定、最可靠、最積極的力量，實現中華民族偉大復興已經進入不可逆轉的歷史進程。他強調，立法會選舉在十二月七日將如期舉行，是對憲制秩序和法治精神的遵守和尊重，是對維護社會穩定和災後重建工作的有力支撐，也是對香港未來最負責任的態度。

韓大元教授系統地闡述「中華民族」概念的歷史脈絡、「中華民族偉大復興」寫入憲法的重大意義、憲法如何為民族復興提供根本法保障，以及「一國兩制」與民族復興的內在關係，強調憲法是實現中華民族偉大復興的根本保障。他呼籲大家以憲法和基本法凝聚社會共識，守護好香港的法治，珍惜來之不易的「一國兩制」實踐成果，積極參與「一國兩制」下香港特色民主發展的實踐，爲建設開放、包容、充滿活力的國際化大都市作出貢獻。

劉兆佳教授在座談會對談環節表示，憲法是推進強國建設與民族復興的「壓艙石」與根本法律支撐。憲法把「中華民族偉大復興」寫入根本法，確立了發展路線、改革開放原則與中國共產黨領導的核心地位，還為凝聚全民族力量等方面提供了堅實憲制保障。李大壯則表示，如果將《基本法》比作大樹，《憲法》就是樹根，二者共同構成了香港的憲制秩序。他期望香港下一代能增進對憲法的了解與學習，夯實社會法治基礎。

座談會除了在政府網站和部分主要電視台直播外，亦安排足本版上載至政制及內地事務局網站（www.cmab.gov.hk/tc/home/index.htm）讓市民重溫。有關「國家憲法日」的其他資訊，可瀏覽「國家憲法日」專頁（www.cmab.gov.hk/tc/issues/constitution_day.htm）。"
2025 Constitution Day Seminar (with photos/video),2025-12-04 20:38,2025-12-04 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400704.htm,"  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR today (December 4) jointly held a seminar on Constitution Day, with the Endeavour Education Centre as the supporting organisation. The Seminar aims to enhance public understanding of the constitutional basis of the country and HKSAR. Before the seminar began, all participants stood and observed one minute of silence in memory of the victims of the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po.

The theme of the Seminar was ""The Constitution and the Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation"". The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, and Deputy Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR Mr Liu Guangyuan delivered speeches respectively. This was followed by a keynote address from Professor Han Dayuan who is member of the HKSAR Basic Law Committee under the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and professor of the Renmin Law School, Renmin University of China. The panel discussion session was moderated by member of the Management Committee of the Endeavour Education Centre, Mrs Rita Fan, who hosted a discussion with consultant of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies Professor Lau Siu-kai, and member of the Committee for Liaison with Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and Overseas Chinese of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Mr David Lie. About 900 participants from various sectors of the community attended the Seminar.

Speaking at the Seminar, Mr Lee, first expressed deep condolences to the victims of the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po and offered sincere sympathies to their families and the affected residents. He said that the HKSAR Government is devoting all-out efforts to disaster relief and follow-up support, and will establish an independent committee to conduct a comprehensive review of the incident, in order to prevent similar tragedies from reoccurring and meet public expectations. He said that the painful lessons from this incident will be transformed into concrete measures to strengthen urban safety and drive institutional reform.

Mr Lee said the Constitution provides the strongest rule-of-law safeguards and institutional foundation for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and it is also the constitutional basis for establishing HKSAR. On the journey of national rejuvenation, Hong Kong is both a participant and a beneficiary. In the 28 years since its return to the motherland, Hong Kong have fully demonstrated the strong vitality and institutional superiority of ""one country, two systems"", with its status as an international financial, shipping and trade centre remaining firmly consolidated. He also pointed out that Hong Kong must in future fulfil three key roles and contributions: safeguarding the Constitution and the Basic Law; better integrating into and serving the overall national development by seizing the national development directives and opportunities for Hong Kong set out in the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan, consolidating and enhancing its status as an international financial, shipping and trade centre, building an international innovation and technology centre as well as a hub for international high-calibre talents, and developing new quality productive forces; and serving as a bridge for exchanges between Chinese culture and world civilisations by telling the true stories of the successful practice of ""one country, two systems"". Finally, Mr Lee called on all sectors to work together to build and develop Hong Kong, contribute to the cause of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and actively vote on December 7 to elect capable and aspiring Legislative Council members who will join the Government in assisting the victims, promoting reforms and building a better home in Hong Kong.

  Mr Liu, said the Constitution provides rule-of-law safeguards for realising the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation; lays the legal foundation for Hong Kong to integrate into the grand journey of national rejuvenation; and endows Hong Kong with institutional advantages to leverage its strengths in the great cause of national rejuvenation. Under the safeguard of the Constitution, China has today become the most stable, reliable and proactive force in global development, and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process. He emphasised that the Legislative Council election proceeding as scheduled on December 7 will demonstrate observance of and respect for the constitutional order and the spirit of the rule of law, and will provide strong support for maintaining social stability and post-tragedy reconstruction work. It represents the most responsible attitude towards Hong Kong's future.

Professor Han systematically elaborated on the historical context of the concept of the ""Chinese nation"", the profound significance of incorporating ""the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"" into the Constitution, how the Constitution provides fundamental legal safeguards for national rejuvenation, and the intrinsic relationship between ""one country, two systems"" and national rejuvenation. He stressed that the Constitution is the fundamental guarantee for realising the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. He called on everyone to rally social consensus around the Constitution and the Basic Law, safeguard Hong Kong's rule of law, and cherish the hard-won achievements of the practice of ""one country, two systems"", actively participate in the development of democracy with Hong Kong characteristics under ""one country, two systems"", and contribute to building an open, inclusive and vibrant international metropolis.

During the panel discussion session, Professor Lau said the Constitution serves as the ""ballast stone"" and fundamental legal support for building China into a great country and achieving national rejuvenation. By inscribing ""the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"" into the fundamental law, the Constitution establishes the development path, principles of reform and opening up, and the core leadership position of the Communist Party of China, while providing solid constitutional safeguards for uniting the strength of the entire nation. Mr Lie said that if the Basic Law is likened to a great tree, the Constitution is its root, and together they form Hong Kong's constitutional order. He hoped the younger generation in Hong Kong will deepen their understanding and study of the Constitution, thereby reinforcing the rule-of-law foundation of society.

The Government has arranged the government website as well as some major television stations to broadcast live the Seminar. The full version of the Seminar will also be uploaded to the website of the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau (www.cmab.gov.hk/en/home/index.htm) to enable members of the public to review the Seminar.

4.不會收取與「大埔宏福苑援助基金」的銀行帳戶往來的手續費——各零售銀行亦不會收取任何與政府「大埔宏福苑援助基金」銀行帳戶往來的手續費，包括存入捐款及收取基金資助；

5. 繼續延長大埔區銀行分行的服務時間——大埔區的銀行分行將繼續延長服務時間，於十二月六日（星期六）上午九時至下午五時及十二月七日（星期日）上午九時至下午一時保持營業。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-04 19:47,2025-12-04 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400699.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 4), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
-------------------------------

  Regarding the imported case involving a 63-year-old male residing in Kwai Tsing District that the CHP announced last week, the CHP has completed the genome analysis of this patient's sample. The results showed that the genetic sequence was identical to those of two previously announced local cases (a 63-year-old male and a 49-year-old female residing in Tsing Yi), indicating that the three patients shared a common source of infection. However, it is differed from the genetic sequences of other local or imported CF cases. Their activities overlapped in Tsing Yi North, primarily in the Tsing Yi town centre and the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Based on epidemiological investigation and genome analysis, the CHP now reclassified this case as locally acquired. The cluster involves a total of three patients. Since late November, relevant government departments have strengthened mosquito-borne disease prevention and control measures in response to the cases in Tsing Yi, and conducted active contact tracing in the area. Therefore, this local case has no substantial impacts on the current overall risk assessment.

  Of the 77 confirmed CF cases in Hong Kong this year, nine were local, and the rest were imported.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------------

Regarding the local case involving a 23-year-old female living in Sheung Wan announced yesterday (December 3), the epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

The CHP urged the members of the public residing and working in Queen's Road West (near Morrison Street and Hollywood Road) who experienced a fever, rash or joint pain on or after November 15 to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately. The CHP officers continued to reach out to individuals in the aforementioned locations to remind individuals to be aware of relevant symptoms and to maintain good environmental hygiene in their households.

As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 1 100 individuals residing or working in the higher-risk district through the health consultation booth at the main entrance of the Sheung Wan Civic Centre, its enquiry hotline (2125 2373) and questionnaire surveys. One individual with mild symptoms has been arranged to undergo blood tests. Result is pending.

On the other hand, as some confirmed CF cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considered the trails to be a higher-risk area. As a precautionary measure, the CHP continued to urge individuals who have recently visited the Tsing Yi North area or hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the aforesaid enquiry hotline.

Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the FEHD has been conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. Pamphlets have been also distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations. The FEHD has earlier requested the relevant departments to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. The FEHD also held meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to coordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Furthermore, the FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-12-04 19:30,2025-12-04 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400687.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月四日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

中心上周公布的一宗輸入個案，涉及一名63歲居於葵青區的男病人。中心已完成對該名男病人樣本的基因分析工作，結果顯示其病毒的基因排序與早前公布的兩宗本地個案（一名63歲男病人及一名49歲女病人，兩人均居於青衣）完全相同，顯示三人有共同感染源頭，但與其他本地或輸入個案的基因排序不同。三人在青衣北的活動範圍有重疊，主要涉及青衣市中心一帶及青衣自然徑附近。基於流行病學調查及基因數據分析，中心現將這上述個案判定為本地感染個案。現時該群組共涉及三名病人。政府各相關部門自十一月底已經針對青衣的個案加強蚊媒防控措施，以及在當區進行個案主動追蹤工作，因此這宗本地個案對現時整體的風險評估沒有太大影響。

本港今年累計錄得77宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，九宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

政府全方位跟進
———————

就昨日（十二月三日）公布一宗涉及一名居於上環的23歲女子的本地個案，流行病學調查仍然繼續進行。

中心呼籲在上環皇后大道西（近摩利臣街和荷李活道一帶）居住或上班的市民，如於十一月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員會繼續接觸上述地點的市民，提醒他們留意有否相關病徵和注意家居環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過設於上環文娛中心正門入口處設立醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於上述受影響地區進行上門探訪，為逾1 100名在較高風險地區工作或居住的市民進行評估，並為一名出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查，正等候結果。

另一方面，鑑於近期部分確診個案報稱曾在青衣自然徑行山期間被蚊叮咬，中心評估該徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心繼續呼籲近期曾在青衣北一帶活動或在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電上述查詢熱線。

​特別針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食環署已進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾、以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署亦已要求相關部門在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地。食環署同時向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持分者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

律政司副司長在香港法律周2025《基本法》頒布35周年法律高峰論壇致辭（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-12-04 19:05,2025-12-04 21:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400650.htm,"以下是律政司副司長張國鈞博士今日（十二月四日）在香港法律周2025《基本法》頒布35周年法律高峰論壇的閉幕致辭：

尊敬的黃玉山教授（全國人民代表大會常務委員會香港特別行政區基本法委員會副主任）、阮國恒先生（香港金融管理局副總裁）、李沛鏗先生（香港機場管理局財務執行總監）、馬時亨教授（香港貿易發展局主席）、張翔教授（香港大學校長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友︰

大家好！適逢今日是國家憲法日，我們特意在這個別具意義的日子舉辦《基本法》頒布35周年法律論壇，作為今年香港法律周其中一個重要活動。

今日的論壇涵蓋多個重要議題。首先，感謝楊兆業主任（全國人民代表大會常務委員會香港、澳門基本法委員會研究室主任）透過主題演講，和我們深入探討《基本法》在香港28年的實踐和啓迪。

香港回歸28年來能夠保持繁榮穩定，全賴《憲法》和《基本法》共同構成香港特別行政區的憲制基礎。《憲法》是國家的根本大法，亦是設立香港特區的法律基礎。《基本法》確立在香港特區實行與國家其他地方不同的制度，為「一國兩制」的實踐提供堅實的法律保障。《基本法》28年來的實踐有目共睹，香港更在今年蟬聯全球最自由經濟體，充分彰顯「一國兩制」的顯著制度優勢。

同時，世界百年變局加速演進，我們更要緊記《基本法》是「活的法律」。我們需要通過不斷完善特別行政區同《憲法》和《基本法》實施相關的制度和機制，堅持依法治港，確保「一國兩制」能全面準確貫徹落實。

《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》共同完善了香港特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制。《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》都是以《憲法》和《基本法》為依據，不但清楚訂明構成有關危害國家安全罪行的元素和刑罰、例外情況及免責辯護，還明確規定尊重和保障人權，堅持法治原則。

《維護國家安全條例》與《香港國安法》有機銜接，標誌着香港特區已具備健全的法律機制來防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動。香港擁有高水平的法治，市民的自由和權利得到更大保護，社會更自由開放，企業業務發展得更好。

香港在拼經濟、謀發展的路上，更要發揮《基本法》和「一國兩制」的優勢，鞏固香港作為「三中心一高地」的地位。剛才的主題論壇在黃教授的主持下，不同界別的翹楚也詳盡分享這個議題。

在《基本法》和「一國兩制」堅實保障下，香港是自由港和單獨關稅區，法治完善，資金、人才、貨物和信息自由進出流通，國際化的營商環境高度可靠、便利，加速金融、航空和貿易活動在香港蓬勃發展，提升香港「三中心」地位。

而且，香港中英雙語並行，內聯外通，實行簡單低稅制，更擁有五所世界百強大學，絕對能夠吸引環球人才來香港成就夢想，助力香港發展成為國際高端人才集聚高地。

最後，我衷心感謝各位講者和嘉賓今日就《基本法》相關議題提出精闢見解，使我們獲益良多。在《基本法》的保駕護航下，香港必定能乘風破浪，充分發揮「三中心一高地」的優勢，無縫融入國家發展大局，實現「一國兩制」事業的高質量發展。謝謝。"

Import of poultry eggs from Udham Singh Nagar District of Uttarakhand State in India suspended,2025-12-04 18:47,2025-12-04 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400637.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (December 4) that in view of a notification from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) about an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in the Udham Singh Nagar District of Uttarakhand State in India, the CFS has instructed the trade to suspend the import of poultry eggs from the area with immediate effect to protect public health in Hong Kong.

A CFS spokesman said that Hong Kong has currently established a protocol with India for the import of poultry eggs but not for poultry meat. According to the Census and Statistics Department, no eggs were imported into Hong Kong from India in the first nine months of this year.

""The CFS has contacted the Indian authority over the issue and will closely monitor information issued by the WOAH and the relevant authorities on the avian influenza outbreak. Appropriate action will be taken in response to the development of the situation,"" the spokesman said."
印度北阿坎德邦Udham Singh Nagar地區禽蛋暫停進口,2025-12-04 18:47,2025-12-04 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400639.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（十二月四日）宣布，因應世界動物衞生組織通報，指印度北阿坎德邦Udham Singh Nagar地區爆發高致病性H5N1禽流感，中心即時指示業界暫停從該地區進口禽蛋，以保障本港公眾健康。

中心發言人說，香港目前與印度只建立禽蛋進口機制，並無禽肉進口機制。根據政府統計處的資料，本港今年首九個月並沒有從印度進口禽蛋。

發言人說：「中心已就事件聯絡印度當局，並會繼續密切留意世界動物衞生組織及有關當局發出關於爆發禽流感的消息，因應當地疫情發展，採取適當行動。」"
盆菜微生物含量調查結果滿意（附圖）,2025-12-04 18:40,2025-12-04 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400274.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（十二月四日）公布，最近完成一項有關盆菜微生物含量的時令食品調查，全部樣本通過檢測。

中心發言人說：「盆菜在冬季聚會中特別受歡迎，而過往曾發生與盆菜有關的細菌性食物中毒，因此，中心今年繼續進行這項時令食品調查，以評估盆菜的微生物含量。中心從不同零售商（包括網上零售商）抽取了三十個盆菜樣本，檢測較常引致食物中毒的致病菌含量，包括蠟樣芽孢桿菌、產氣莢膜梭狀芽孢桿菌、沙門氏菌、凝固酶陽性葡萄球菌及副溶血性弧菌。」

雖然是次調查結果滿意，但發言人提醒市民在選購及進食這種時令食品時仍需小心。消費者應向持牌及可靠的商鋪訂購盆菜，進食前應把盆菜徹底翻熱並盡快食用，或把盆菜保持於攝氏六十度以上，避免把盆菜放在室溫下過久，以減低細菌繁殖的風險。如食物有異味或異樣，便不應進食。

發言人說：「市民亦應注意均衡飲食，避免過量進食高熱量、高糖分、高鹽分或高脂肪的食品。」

他亦提醒業界應預先作周詳計劃，確保有足夠的人手、空間及設備製作盆菜，避免接受過量訂單。有條理的工作程序有助預防交叉污染，故在製作盆菜前，應訓練臨時員工，確保他們熟悉工作環境，並遵守安全烹製食物的守則。收貨時應檢查食材的質量，並確保冷凍及冷藏食品送來時的溫度合適。另外，應避免過早配製食材，並注意貯放、運送和處理食物的溫度，以減低食物中毒的風險。

發言人說：「所有食材均需貯放於安全溫度，易變壞的食品應存放在攝氏四度或以下。若要冷卻已煮熟的食物，應盡量縮短所需時間。運送熱盆菜時，應把溫度保持在攝氏六十度以上，而冷凍的盆菜則應保持在攝氏四度或以下。在食用盆菜前，要徹底翻熱至中心溫度達攝氏七十五度或以上或完全煮沸。分量較大的盆菜需要較長的時間翻熱，才可令食物熱透。」

他補充：「過往本港曾出現因盆菜處理不當而導致的食物中毒個案，業界應向消費者提供有關正確貯存及翻熱盆菜的方法，如在盆菜包裝外加上提示標籤，以進一步減低因不當處理盆菜而引致食物中毒的風險。」

中心會繼續監察市面上銷售的盆菜，以確保食物安全和保障市民健康。"
Test results of microbiological quality of poon choi satisfactory (with photo),2025-12-04 18:40,2025-12-04 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400269.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (December 4) announced the test results of a recently completed seasonal food surveillance project on the microbiological quality of poon choi. All samples passed the tests.
ã
A CFS spokesperson said, ""As poon choi is popular for gatherings during winter, and there have been previous cases of bacterial food poisoning associated with poon choi, the CFS has continued to conduct a seasonal food surveillance project this year to assess the microbiological quality of poon choi. A total of 30 poon choi samples were collected from different retailers (including online retailers) to test for common food poisoning organisms including Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci organisms and Vibrio parahaemolyticus.""
ã
Despite the satisfactory results of the samples tested, the spokesman reminded members of the public to be careful when purchasing and enjoying this seasonal delicacy. He advised consumers to order poon choi from licensed and reliable shops, reheat poon choi thoroughly before consumption, consume the food as soon as possible or keep the food at temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius, avoid prolonged storage of poon choi at room temperature to reduce the risk of bacteria growth, and stop consuming the food if it tastes or smells abnormal.
ã
""The public should also maintain a balanced diet and avoid eating too much food with high levels of energy, sugar, salt or fat,"" the spokesman said.
ã
He also appealed to the food trade to plan thoroughly in advance to secure adequate manpower, space and equipment for making poon choi and not to entertain orders beyond handling capacity. A well-organised work procedure can help prevent cross-contamination. As such, before preparation of poon choi, temporary food handlers should be trained to make sure that they are familiar with the working environment and adhere to safe food preparation practices. Traders are also reminded to check the quality of food ingredients and ensure that the temperatures of chilled and frozen foods are appropriate when they are delivered to them. In addition, to reduce the risk of food poisoning, they should avoid preparing food too far in advance and take note of the temperature in storing, transporting and preparing food.
ã
""All food ingredients should be stored at safe temperatures while perishable items should be stored at 4 degrees C or below. The cooling time of cooked food should be reduced as far as possible. When transporting hot poon choi, it should be kept at above 60 degrees C, and for chilled poon choi, it should be kept at 4 degrees C or below. Poon choi should be reheated thoroughly until the core temperature reaches 75 degrees C or above, or brought to boil before consumption. Poon choi of a larger portion requires more time to reheat before the food can be fully heated,"" the spokesman said.
ã
""There have been food poisoning cases related to improper handling of poon choi in Hong Kong. Traders should provide clear advice on the proper methods of storing and reheating of poon choi to consumers, such as putting a reminder on the food label to further reduce the risk of food poisoning due to improper handling,"" he added.

The CFS will continue its surveillance of poon choi available in the market to ensure food safety and protect the health of the public."
Kick-off meeting on establishment of new medical school held today,2025-12-04 18:26,2025-12-04 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400563.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, and the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, co-chaired a meeting today (December 4) to receive a briefing from the President of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Professor Nancy Ip, and her team on the next steps for implementing the establishment of the new medical school. Government representatives attending the meeting were from the Health Bureau, the Education Bureau, the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, theDevelopment Bureau, the Department of Health, the Hospital Authority, theUniversity Grants Committee Secretariat, and thePrimary Health Commission.

  The Government earlier announced that the Chief Executive in Council (CE-in-Council) had approved in principle that the new medical school to be established by the HKUST, marking a new phase in the preparatory work for the new medical school. The Task Group on New Medical School will support and closely monitor the work in the implementation stage to ensure that the HKUST achieves the set milestones in a progressive manner. Working groups will be set up under the Task Group to provide advice and support in areas such as curriculum development, financial and financing arrangements, staffing, campus development, and teaching hospital arrangements, and experts with relevant experience in the respective fields will be invited to participate in the work of the working groups. The Government will require the HKUST to regularly report progress to and seek views from the working groups and report to the Task Group as necessary.

  Professor Lo said, ""At today's meeting, we exchanged views on the overall work direction for the implementation stage of establishing the medical school. We support the HKUST to push forward various preparatory tasks, and the Task Group will regularly meet with the university representatives starting from the first quarter of next year to understand the progress. The Government expects to officially sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the HKUST early next year, the content of which will cover funding arrangements, curriculum accreditation, teaching hospital resources, as well as recruitment of teaching staff, and more. We expect the HKUST to fully co-operate with the Task Group and its working groups on the preparatory work.""

  Dr Choi said, ""The establishment of the new medical school is expected to play a leading role in shaping innovative approaches to medical education by embracing interdisciplinary learning, advancing scientific research development, and attracting both local and international talent, to dovetail with the national blueprint of the 2024-2035 master plan on building China into a leading country in education and the vision of building Hong Kong into an international post-secondary education hub. We are confident that the new medical school will actively foster collaboration within the Greater Bay Area through its strategic location in the Northern Metropolis and serve as an academic and research powerhouse in the region, contributing to the development of a robust and forward-thinking healthcare workforce.""

  The Chief Executive announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the Government supports the establishment of the third medical school by a local university, with a view to nurturing more outstanding medical practitioners to support the local healthcare system in providing quality services, while at the same time promoting the development of Hong Kong into an international medical training, research and innovation hub. The Task Group was established in October 2024, comprising seasoned local, Mainland and overseas academics in medical education and university management, professionals, representatives from the Medical Council of Hong Kong (MCHK) and the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, as well as representatives from the relevant government bureaux and departments. It is responsible for inviting universities to submit proposals and conducting assessments, making recommendations to the CE-in-Council, and maintaining communication with the university selected to establish the new medical school on the implementation plan. In November this year, the CE-in-Council approved the establishment of the third medical school and gave approval-in-principle for the new medical school to be established by the HKUST, which shall aim to admit the first cohort of 50 students in the 2028/29 academic year. The HKUST must obtain in-principle approval from the MCHK for the accreditation of its medical curriculum before the commencement of student admission."
籌建新醫學院啓動會議今日舉行,2025-12-04 18:26,2025-12-04 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400559.htm,"醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士今日（十二月四日）共同主持會議，聽取香港科技大學（科大）校長葉玉如教授及其團隊簡報落實設立新醫學院的下一步工作。出席會議的政府代表來自醫務衞生局、教育局、創新科技及工業局、發展局、衞生署、醫院管理局、大學教育資助委員會秘書處和基層醫療署。

政府早前公布行政長官會同行政會議原則上批准新醫學院由科大籌辦，標誌着新醫學院的籌備工作邁向新階段。籌備新醫學院工作組會支持並密切監察實施階段的工作，確保科大按部就班完成目標。工作組轄下將成立工作小組為課程發展、財政及融資安排、教職員人手、校園發展和教學醫院安排等範疇提供意見及支援，並邀請在相關各領域具相關經驗的專家參與工作小組的工作。政府會要求科大定期向工作小組匯報進度並尋求意見，再按需要向工作組報告。

盧寵茂教授表示：「在今日的會議上，我們就成立醫學院實施階段的整體工作方向交換意見。我們支持科大積極推進各項籌備工作，工作組會由明年第一季起定期與大學代表會面了解進度。政府預計明年初正式與科大簽訂諒解備忘錄，其內容將涵蓋資金安排、課程認證、教學醫院資源，以至招募教職員等，並期望科大就籌備工作和工作組與其轄下工作小組充分合作。」

蔡若蓮博士說：「我們期待新醫學院能透過推動跨學科學習、深化科研發展、匯聚本地及國際人才，在塑造創新醫學教育模式方面發揮領導作用，對接《教育強國建設規劃綱要（2024–2035年）》國家藍圖，助力香港成為國際專上教育樞紐。我們深信新醫學院可憑藉其位於北部都會區的戰略位置，積極推動大灣區內合作，成為區域學術研究重點項目，為培育具前瞻思維的醫療人才提供堅實支撐。」

行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》宣布，支持本地大學籌建第三所醫學院，以培養更多優秀醫生支持本地醫療體系提供優質服務，同時推動香港發展成為國際醫療培訓、研究和創新樞紐。工作組於二○二四年十月成立，由具豐富醫學教學和大學管理經驗的本地和海內外學者、專業人士、香港醫務委員會和香港醫學專科學院代表，以及相關政府政策局和部門代表組成，負責邀請大學提交建議書並進行評估，向行政長官會同行政會議提出建議，及與獲選成立新醫學院的大學就實施計劃保持溝通。行政長官會同行政會議於今年十一月通過設立第三所醫學院，並原則上批准新醫學院由科大籌辦。科大須以在二○二八／二九學年錄取第一屆50名學生為目標，並在招收學生之前須獲得香港醫務委員會原則上同意認可其醫學課程。"
Primary Healthcare Commission arranges more comprehensive primary healthcare services for residents affected by Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire,2025-12-04 18:18,2025-12-04 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120400546.htm,"  Following the earlier announcement that the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) will serve as hubs for arranging free primary healthcare services for residents affected by the fire incident in Tai Po, the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) announced today (December 4) the establishment of a free family doctor service scheme to support the affected residents. Serving as hubs, the DHCs across all 18 districts in Hong Kong have arranged case managers to follow up on the primary healthcare needs of the affected residents comprehensively. Based on the situations of individual cases and the preferences of affected residents, case managers will pair them with private sector family doctors participating in the scheme or the Hospital Authority (HA)'s Family Medicine Out-patient Services.

  Under the co-ordination of the PHC Commission, more than 140 family doctors in the private sector have participated in the scheme currently, covering 170 service points including four private hospitals. Affected residents can receive up to three free consultations, through the DHCs' arrangements, from today until February 28 next year. The services cover drug prescriptions, including necessary medication refills based on one's medical history; follow-ups on post-incident conditions, including respiratory illness; and management of symptoms related to stress and anxiety. Affected residents with healthcare needs can call the hotlines or visit any DHC in person to seek assistance, regardless of their current place of residence. If affected residents are registered DHC members, they can also contact their respective DHC directly. The hotlines have been posted on the websites of the PHC Commissionand the DHCs. Case managers of the DHCs will pair affected residents with private family doctors participating in the scheme.

  The HA earlier announced that full medical fee waivers would be provided for affected residents, covering Family Medicine Out-patient Services. Based on the situations of individual cases and the preferences of affected residents, case managers of the DHCs will also assist them in accessing the HA's Family Medicine Out-patient Services. So far, more than 300 consultations have been provided by the Family Medicine Out-patient Services for affected residents.

  In addition to the pairing of consultation services, the DHCs, serving as hubs, have been providing affected residents with personalised case management services. These include co-ordinating arrangements for follow-up appointments and medication refills, making referrals for specialised healthcare, nursing and medication services, as well as psychological support. Affected residents can register via the hotlines without having to visit the DHCs in person. Operators of emergency transitional housing and social workers from the Social Welfare Department can also assist in referring residents in need to receive services at the DHCs.

  The medical stations currently set up at temporary shelters, co-ordinated by the PHC Commission, will remain in operation until closure of the shelters. The medical stations have provided medical and psychological support services for over 2 000 consultations so far.

  The PHC Commission expressed gratitude to the private healthcare sector for its enthusiastic support in providing assistance to affected residents. Family doctors who wish to participate in the free services scheme can contact the PHC Commission (email address: phcc@healthbureau.gov.hk ), demonstrating the spirit of compassion and social responsibility. The PHC Commission is also co-ordinating free Chinese medicine services through the Chinese Medicine Unit of the Health Bureau. Further details will be announced later."

Deputy Head Li Shengjun (Deputy Head of the Patent Office of the China National Intellectual Property Administration), Deputy Director-General Wang Binying (Deputy Director-General of the World Intellectual Property Organization), Sophia (Executive Director of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Ms Sophia Chong),distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good afternoon.

 Welcome to Hong Kong, and to the 15th edition of the Business of IP Asia Forum. This year's Forum brings together some 3000 IP owners, service providers, and users from over 30 countries and regions under a defining theme.

 We have started today's programme with purpose. This morning's keynote session on IP valuation and financing has set the tone - how to recognise, value, and deploy intangible assets as investable capital. Indeed, IP financing has been fast-developing around the world. An international research report showed that IP financing market revenue was valued at USD$8.5 billion in 2024 and is estimated to reach USD$15.2 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 7.2 per cent from 2026 to 2033, indicating strong demand and expansion.

 This morning's discussion is timely, as it aligns with the commitment of ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" on transforming Hong Kong's unique strengths into a worldâclass ecosystem where IP is protected with rigour, valued with clarity, and financed with confidence. The measures are set to strengthen our role as a regional IP trading centre.

 Our ability to deliver on this vision rests on our distinctive foundations. Hong Kong's common law system delivers predictability and enforceability that global markets trust. Our strategic location - at the heart of Asia and deeply connected with the Chinese Mainland, especially the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, links research and development with manufacturing, trials with scaleâup, and capital with customers. Our financial infrastructure supports the full spectrum of IP transactions from licensing to mergers and acquisitions, venture capital to IP-backed or credit financing.

 The 2025 Policy Address has set the stage to turn these strengths into tangible outcomes. At the heart of the effort is the IP financing sandbox. For too long, innovators, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and start-ups have faced a critical gap: their most valuable assets - patents, copyright, trade marks, and other types of IP - have been difficult to be traded or leveraged for financing as growth capital. We are pioneering a host of initiatives to answer this challenge. The sandbox will provide a collaborative environment designed to fundamentally rewire how the value of IP can be leveraged for financing, and where stakeholders co-create the next generation of IP financing.

 The sandbox will bring together three key stakeholder groups: First, innovators and IP owners, who can bring their IP assets forward for pilot financing. Second, banks and valuation, and legal professionals, who can test new credit assessment models, valuation standards and financing products in a controlled setting. And third, regulators and public bodies, who will provide guidance and help codify what works.

 We are also aligning the wider ecosystem. With the support of the Intellectual Property Department, the Hong Kong Technology and Innovation Support Centre (HKTISC) will engage SMEs in the innovation and technology sector to provide a patent evaluation service to assess, based on national standards, the quality of the patents they hold, from the legal, technological and economic perspectives. The Government will also work through the HKTISC to launch a two-year pilot funding support scheme to help SMEs engage professional service providers to valuate their IP portfolios in monetary terms.

 Our patent examiner team is expanding and we are taking forward the preparatory work for introduction of regulatory arrangement for local patent agent services, with a view to building a local pool of patent talents.

 Our Copyright Ordinance and registered designs regime will be modernised to ensure our legal framework is fit for the digital age; and finally, we are creating the deal flow by arranging a business-matching programme connecting Mainland enterprises with Hong Kong's world-class IP service providers to embody our ""bringing in and going global"" strategy.

 These are not separate initiatives; they are interconnected parts of an ambitious vision. The HKTISC helps innovators create quality assets. The patent valuation subsidy scheme helps establish patents' technical and economic worth. Our legal reforms provide the certainty. Business matching and regional partnerships generate the opportunities. And the sandbox turns it all into financeable, scalable reality.

 Last but not least, my thanks to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council for co-organising this flagship event. Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you all a rewarding forum."
