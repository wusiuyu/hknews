LCQ8: Measures for handling retired electric vehicle batteries,2026-01-21 14:15,2026-01-21 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100225.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Pui-leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

  There are views pointing out that with the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EV) in Hong Kong, the volume of retired EV batteries (retired batteries) is expected to rise significantly. However, if such retired batteries are not handled properly, the hazardous substances they contain may cause serious environmental pollution and safety issues. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the annual number of retired batteries generated in Hong Kong in the past three years; the respective numbers of batteries that underwent preliminary treatment at licensed disposal facilities in Hong Kong and were exported overseas for recycling;

(2) since the launch of the ""ezbatteries"" scheme sponsored by the Recycling Fund in December 2022, of the respective annual numbers of batteries recycled and those used for second-life applications; whether the authorities have established performance indicators for the scheme and assessed its effectiveness; if so, of the specific indicators and assessment results; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) as the Mainland approved early last year an action planto improve the recycling system for used new energy vehicle power batteries to further enhance the utilisation capacity of recycled power batteries, and that it is reported that many other Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) have now established relatively well-developed recycling systems for retired EV batteries, whether the authorities have plans to strengthen co-operation between Hong Kong and other Mainland cities in GBA to establish a cross-border battery recycling network, with a view to enhancing resource circulation efficiency; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) as it has been reported that the technology for cascade utilisation of retired batteries (i.e. sorting, dismantling and reassembling retired batteries for application in other fields to achieve resource utilisation and environmental protection) in the Mainland is relatively mature, with over 150 ""white-listed enterprises"" (i.e. enterprises meeting the Industry Standardsfor the Comprehensive Utilization of Waste Power Storage Batteries of New Energy Vehicles) responsible for recycling and handling retired batteries, whether the authorities will subsidise or promote more relevant research and development projects to expand the application scope of cascade utilisation of retired battery in Hong Kong and foster the development of the local battery recycling industry; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) given that in its reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on June 8, 2022, the Government indicated that it has kept abreast of the international proposals and policies in relation to the traceability of EV batteries and is considering incorporating those arrangements that suit the local context into the relevant producer responsibility schemes, of the anticipated implementation timeline for the relevant measures on producer responsibility for retired batteries in Hong Kong, and whether such measures will cover the traceability management of EV batteries and the lawful scope of secondary-life applications for retired batteries; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The handling and disposal of retired electric vehicle (EV) batteries are regulated under the Waste Disposal Ordinance (Cap. 354) and the subsidiary Waste Disposal (Chemical Waste) (General) Regulation (Cap. 354C). Currently, EV suppliers have engaged licensed collectors to collect retired batteries from their brands' EVs. These batteries undergo proper preliminary treatment, such as sorting, discharging and insulating, before being packaged and transported overseas to appropriate treatment facilities for recycling.

  The Government started planning for the management of retired EV batteries back in 2021 when it released the Hong Kong Roadmap on Popularisation of Electric Vehicles. The measures include promoting research on the second-life use of retired EV batteries through the Green Tech Fund (GTF); pushing forward the construction of local EV battery recycling facility; and formulating the implementation of a producer responsibility scheme (PRS) on EV batteries.

  Hong Kong's first large-scale EV battery recycling facility at the EcoPark is under construction, which is expected to commence operation in the first half of 2026. This facility aims to convert retired EV batteries into recycled black mass to be supplied to the Mainland and neighbouring regions. It will not only promote the development of the EV battery recycling industry, and strengthen Hong Kong's role in the regional green industry chain, but also serve as a good model for mutually beneficial co-operation in the environmental industry of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. The Government is currently consulting the trade on the operation of the PRS on EV batteries, and expects to consult the Legislative Council (LegCo) Panel on Environmental Affairs on the implementation details within 2026.

  The reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Pui-leung is as follows:

(1) In the past three years (2022-2024), there were a total of about 160 tonnes of retired lithium batteries from vehicles preliminarily treated by local licensed disposal facilities for transporting overseas to appropriate authorised treatment facilities for recycling. A yearly breakdown is as follows:




Year
Total quantity
			(tonnes)


2022
69.5


2023
53.0


2024
38.1




  As the trade may currently store a certain quantity of retired EV batteries for further handling, the figures provided above may not fully reflect the total quantity of retired EV batteries generated by EVs in Hong Kong.

(2) In December 2022, the Recycling Fund allocated funding to launch the ""ezbatteries"" project for 24 months. By establishing a digital platform, the project offered a convenient channel for various stakeholders, including EV owners and recyclers, to learn more about the collection and recycling processes of retired EV batteries, with a view to alleviating their concerns on the handling of retired EV batteries. The project conducted a series of publicity activities, including workshops, seminars, a promotional video and electronic leaflet, to educate the trade and the public about the handling of EV batteries. As the project focuses on promotion and information sharing, it does not involve the actual recycling of retired EV batteries.

(3) In January 2025, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the Guangdong Provincial Government established the Special Panel for Building ""Zero Waste Bay Area"" (the Special Panel) to strengthen policy co-ordination, technical exchanges and project collaboration, as well as elevate the capability in jointly handling solid waste.

  The Special Panel has commenced discussions on topics such as regional co-operation in resources circulation and waste management policy. It has been exploring ways to promote the co-ordination of regulations and market integration between the two regions, covering the potential and feasibility of cross-regional co-operation in handling different kinds of recyclable materials, including recycled black mass converted from retired EV batteries.

(4) As mentioned above, research promoting EVs and the second-life use of EV batteries are listed under the priority theme of green transport under the GTF. At present, the GTF has approved three research and development projects related to the recycling of retired EV batteries, covering application areas such as echelon use of EV batteries, involving a total grant of over $12 million.

(5) As mentioned above, the Government is currently consulting the trade on the PRS on EV batteries. This includes considerations for establishing a product traceability system and repurposing retired batteries in good condition for echelon use. The Government will consult the LegCo Panel on Environmental Affairs on the PRS on EV batteries within 2026."
立法會八題：處理電動車退役電池的措施,2026-01-21 14:15,2026-01-21 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100217.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上陳沛良議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

有意見指出，隨着電動車在香港日益普及，預計電動車退役電池（退役電池）數量將大幅增加。然而，若該等退役電池未有妥善處理，當中的有害物質有可能造成嚴重的環境污染和安全問題。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，本港每年產生的退役電池數目為何；經本港持牌處置設施初步處理及運往外地回收再造的電池數目分別為何；

（二）由回收基金贊助的「易收鋰」計劃自二○二二年十二月推出以來，每年回收及用作二次應用的電池數目分別為何；當局有否就該計劃訂立績效指標，以及評估該計劃的成效；如有，具體指標及評估結果為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）鑑於內地在去年初通過《健全新能源汽車動力電池回收利用體系行動方案》，進一步提升回收動力電池的利用能力，而據報不少粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）其他內地城市目前已建立較完善的電動車退役電池回收體系，當局有否計劃加強本港與大灣區其他內地城市合作，建立跨境電池回收網絡，以提升資源循環效率；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（四）據報內地退役電池的梯次利用技術（即將退役電池進行篩選、拆解及重組後，應用於其他領域，以實現資源化利用和環境保護）已相對成熟，已有超過150家「白名單企業」（即符合《新能源汽車廢舊動力蓄電池綜合利用行業規範條件》的企業）負責回收處理退役電池，當局會否資助或推動更多相關科研項目，擴大本港退役電池梯次利用的應用範疇，並推動本港退役電池回收業的發展；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（五）鑑於政府於二○二二年六月八日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，政府有留意國際間電動車電池追蹤溯源方面的建議和政策，並考慮將適合本地的相關規定納入相關的生產者責任計劃，本港就退役電池生產者責任的相關措施的預計落實時間為何，以及該等措施會否涵蓋電動車電池溯源管理、退役電池二次應用範疇的合法範圍等；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

處置及棄置電動車退役電池均受《廢物處置條例》（第354章）及附屬的《廢物處置（化學廢物）（一般）規例》（第354C章）所規管。現時，電動車供應商均有聘請持牌收集商收集其品牌電動車的退役電池，並經適當初步處理（如分類、放電、絕緣）及包裝後，再運往外地合適處置設施循環再造。

政府早在二○二一年發表《香港電動車普及化路線圖》時，已開始就如何處理電動車退役電池作出部署，措施包括透過低碳綠色科研基金推動電動車退役電池二次應用的研究，引進本地建設電動車電池回收設施，以及籌劃實施電動車電池生產者責任計劃。

全港首間大型電動車電池回收設施已在環保園建設中，相關公司預計二○二六年上半年可以啓用，將退役電池轉化為再生黑粉供應內地和周邊地區。有關回收設施不但有助促進電動車電池回收產業發展，提升香港在區域綠色產業鏈的角色，更為粵港澳大灣區環保產業的互利合作提供良好示範。政府亦正就電動車電池生產者責任計劃的運作諮詢業界，預計在二○二六年內就實施細節諮詢立法會環境事務委員會。

就陳沛良議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）過去三年（二○二二年至二○二四年），經本地持牌處置設施初步處理後運往外地認可合適處置設施循環再造的車用退役鋰電池合共約160公噸，按年分項數字如下：




年份
總量（公噸）


二○二二
69.5


二○二三
53.0


二○二四
38.1




由於業界現時可能會儲存到一定數量的退役電池再進行處理，因此上述數字未必完全反映本港電動車所產生的退役電池數量。

（二）回收基金於二○二二年十二月撥款推行為期24個月的「易收鋰」項目，透過建立一個電子平台，為電動車車主、回收商等不同持份者提供便捷的渠道，協助他們了解更多有關收集和回收電動車退役電池的資訊，以釋除他們對如何處理電動車退役電池的疑慮。項目舉辦了一系列宣傳活動，包括工作坊和講座、宣傳片及電子單張，向業界及公眾推廣電動車電池處理知識。由於項目的性質是宣傳和資料分享，不涉及具體回收電動車退役電池。

（三）香港特別行政區政府與廣東省政府於二○二五年一月成立「無廢灣區」建設專題小組（專題小組），以加強政策對接、技術交流與專案協作，提升固體廢物協同處置能力。

專題小組已就區域性資源循環合作、廢物管理政策等議題展開討論，並正商討推動兩地法規協調和市場對接，以及跨區協同處置不同回收物料的空間和可行性，包括由退役電動車電池轉化的再生黑粉原料。

（四）如上述，推廣電動車及電動車電池二次應用的研究，已被列為低碳綠色科研基金下綠色運輸的優先研究主題。基金至今已批出三個與回收退役電動車電池相關的科研項目，涵蓋電動車電池梯次利用等應用範疇，涉及撥款超過1,200萬元。

（五）如上述，政府正就電動車電池生產者責任計劃諮詢業界，內容包括可否建立產品溯源系統和把狀態理想的退役電池作梯次利用。政府會在二○二六年內就電動車電池生產者責任計劃諮詢立法會環境事務委員會。"
立法會十六題：「跨境一鎖計劃」,2026-01-21 14:10,2026-01-21 14:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100306.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上嚴剛議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的書面答覆：

問題：

香港海關與內地海關自二○一六年正式推行「跨境一鎖計劃」（該計劃），透過應用同一把電子鎖及全球定位系統設備，減少同一批貨物在兩地入境及出境時被重複檢查的機會，簡化清關手續，現時清關點已增至93個。有意見指出，該計劃顯著提升通關效率，並強化香港作為國際航空樞紐的轉運功能，鞏固其「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的樞紐地位。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於閩粵港「跨境一鎖」快速通關模式於二○二四年七月成功開通，實現廈門貨物直達香港國際機場，政府會否與內地部門商討在內地增設更多清關點，以增加該計劃的覆蓋面；

（二）鑑於珠海機場空港國際智慧物流園於去年六月正式投入運作，為進一步提升珠海機場與香港國際機場貨運連接，政府有否計劃與內地部門商討，將珠海機場納入該計劃的清關網絡；政府如何在推行該計劃時，與珠海方面協調升級貨運口岸的空運設施，從而提升港珠跨境貨運專線貨運效率和能力；及

（三）政府會否在該計劃的基礎上，進一步與內地合作提升粵港澳大灣區各清關點的空運服務功能，從而鞏固香港作為國際物流樞紐的領先地位？

答覆：

主席：

就嚴剛議員的提問，經諮詢運輸及物流局後，現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）香港海關與內地海關一直積極擴展「跨境一鎖計劃」的覆蓋範圍。現時計劃共有超過90個清關點，包括香港的13個清關點，廣東省的65個清關點、湖南省的四個清關點、福建省的七個清關點及澳門的四個清關點。兩地海關正籌備把計劃延伸至廣西壯族自治區，為貨運及物流業界提供更多路線選擇。

香港海關會繼續與香港貨運及物流業界保持緊密溝通，包括透過「便利轉運貨物清關業界諮詢小組」的定期會議和舉辦研討會，讓業界進一步認識「跨境一鎖計劃」，並適時向內地海關反映業界的意見及業務需要，包括於內地增設更多清關點的建議。現時，珠海機場並不是計劃下的清關點。

（三）在「跨境一鎖計劃」之外，政府和香港機場管理局正積極發展香港國際機場與東莞之間的「海空貨物聯運」模式，並推進香港國際機場東莞空港中心建設，增加進出內地貨物使用香港空運服務。內地出口貨物在東莞空港中心完成安檢和收貨，可經海路無縫運達香港國際機場，直接轉運海外；國際空運貨物亦可按上述相反路線進口內地。此模式將為粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）貨物提供更無縫、便捷的國際空運網絡，提升貨物轉運效率。政府會積極與內地當局合作，探討不同創新便利方案，優化大灣區的多式聯運連接，鞏固香港作為國際航空樞紐及國際物流樞紐的領先地位。"
LCQ16: Single E-lock Scheme,2026-01-21 14:10,2026-01-21 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100308.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Erik Yim and a written reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

 The Customs and Excise Department officially launched the Single E-lock Scheme (SELS) together with the Mainland Customs since 2016, applying one single e-lock and the technology of global positioning system to reduce duplicate inspection on the same shipment by both Customs authorities at the boundary, thereby streamlining the clearance process. Currently, the number of clearance points has increased to 93. There are views pointing out that the SELS has significantly enhanced clearance efficiency and strengthened the transhipment function of Hong Kong as an international aviation hub, reinforcing its hub status of being ""backed by the motherland and connected to the world"". In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the Fujian-Guangdong-Hong Kong SELS was officially launched in July 2024 to realise Xiamen cargo arriving at the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) directly, whether the Government will discuss with the Mainland authorities the establishment of more clearance points on the Mainland to expand the coverage of the SELS;

(2) given that the Zhuhai Airport International Intelligent Logistics Park officially commenced operations in June last year to further enhance the cargo connectivity between the Zhuhai Airport and the HKIA, whether the Government has plans to discuss with the Mainland authorities the inclusion of the Zhuhai Airport in the SELS's customs clearance network; how the Government will co-ordinate with the Zhuhai authorities to upgrade air cargo facilities at cargo ports in implementing the SELS, thereby enhancing the efficiency and capacity of the dedicated Hong Kong-Zhuhai cross-boundary cargo route; and

(3) whether it will, on the basis of the SELS, further collaborate with the Mainland to enhance the functions of air cargo services at the various clearance points across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's leading position as an international logistics hub?

Reply:

President,

 Having consulted the Transport and Logistics Bureau, our reply to the Hon Erik Yim's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) The Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) has been actively extending the coverage of the Single E-lock Scheme with the Mainland Customs. Currently, the Scheme covers over 90 clearance points, including 13 in Hong Kong, 65 in Guangdong Province, four in Hunan Province, seven in Fujian Province and four in Macao. The two Customs authorities are preparing to extend the Scheme to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, providing the cargo freight and logistics sectors with more route options.

 The C&ED will continue to closely liaise with cargo freight and logistics sectors of Hong Kong through regular meetings with the Transshipment Cargo Clearance Facilitation Customer Liaison Group and organising seminars to enable the industry to better understand the Scheme. The C&ED would relay the industry's views and business needs to the Mainland Customs, including establishment of additional clearance points in the Mainland. At present, Zhuhai Airport is not a clearance point under the Scheme.

(3) In addition to the Scheme, the Government and the Airport Authority Hong Kong are actively developing the sea-air intermodal cargo transshipment mode between the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and Dongguan, and taking forward the construction of the HKIA Dongguan Logistics Park, to boost the use of Hong Kong air cargo services for transporting goods to and from the Mainland. Export cargo from the Mainland can go through security screening and cargo acceptance in the HKIA Dongguan Logistics Park and then be transported seamlessly by sea to the HKIA for direct transshipment to overseas destinations. International air cargo may also be imported into the Mainland through the reverse process. This mode will allow cargo in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to be transported through a more seamless and convenient international air network and improve the efficiency of air cargo transshipment. The Government will actively co-operate with the Mainland authorities, explore various innovative facilitation schemes and enhance multimodal connectivity within the GBA, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's leading position as an international aviation hub and international logistics hub."

Three employers sanctioned for violating requirements of local recruitment under Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme,2026-01-21 14:00,2026-01-21 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100303.htm,"The Labour Department (LD) today (January 21) announced the imposition of an administrative sanction on Grosswell Limited, Pei Ho Ming Ho Roasted Meat Restaurant and its sole proprietor, and Tmomo (Tsuen Wan) Limited. With effect from January 19, 2026, the LD will refuse to process any applications for importing labour under the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) submitted by the above employers for a period of two years. At the same time, the LD has terminated the processing of applications previously submitted by the employers.

Following complaints received earlier and subsequent investigations conducted by the LD, it has been substantiated that the above employers violated the requirements of local recruitment under the ESLS, including:

(1) Grosswell Limited, while applying for the importation of general office clerks and accounting clerks, imposed an additional recruitment requirement on local job seekers without obtaining the LD's consent and refused to employ a job seeker who met the original requirements;

(2) Pei Ho Ming Ho Roasted Meat Restaurant and its sole proprietor, while applying for the importation of kitchen helpers, failed to provide job seekers with all the job vacancies that had passed the preliminary screening of the LD, causing the job seekers to decline its employment offers, which is tantamount to refusing to employ qualified job seekers; and

(3) Tmomo (Tsuen Wan) Limited, while applying for the importation of stock keepers, refused to employ a qualified job seeker.

A spokesman for the LD stressed, ""Employers applying for the importation of workers under the ESLS should strictly comply with the requirements of the ESLS, including according priority to employing suitable local workers. The ESLS stipulates that if an employer violates labour or immigration laws, the requirements of the ESLS or the Standard Employment Contract, the LD will impose an administrative sanction on the employer, including withdrawal of approvals for the importation of workers previously granted and refusal to process any subsequent applications submitted by the employer."""
立法會二題：推進人工智能在各行業的深度應用,2026-01-21 13:15,2026-01-21 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100299.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上陳祖恒議員的提問和創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授的答覆：

問題：

 國家二○二五年《政府工作報告》指明要「持續推進『人工智能+』（AI+）行動」。而去年《施政報告》強調推進AI+發展，促進AI在各行業的廣泛深度融合和應用。就此，政府可否告知本會：

答覆：

主席：

人工智能（AI）是香港的核心產業之一。過去數年，我們循着《香港創新科技發展藍圖》的策略，積極建設本地AI生態圈，以「強化基礎設施、促進應用導向」為重心，完善上、中、下游的聯動，全力推動香港AI多維度發展。此發展路向亦與國家提出的「人工智能+」行動一脈相承。

就陳祖恒議員的提問，我現回覆如下。

（一）政府就AI的系統布局，涵蓋科研、算力、數據、人才以及資金等領域，為香港深化實踐「人工智能+」行動和更好地支持及服務國家「十五五」時期高質量發展大局，提供了有力支撐。其中，二○二五年《施政報告》提出大力拓展AI應用，以AI賦能產業，實現「AI產業化、產業AI化」，正是我們明確的AI+行動綱領。本地科技園區聚集近千家AI相關的企業亦在過程中提供強大動力。

以陳議員提及包括紡織業在內的傳統產業為例，香港生產力促進局設立香港工業人工智能及機械人研發中心，專注發展工業AI和機械人技術及商品化。中心正在開發的項目涵蓋AI在製造業各層面的應用，例如物流、自動化組裝以及產品質量檢測等。

此外，政府一直透過「創新及科技基金」（基金）協助傳統優勢產業邁向數碼化轉型及智能升級。截至去年年底，基金已累計批出超過14億元資助有關AI的項目，加強製造業的競爭力與創新能力。與此同時，基金已資助超過350個、總額約10億元與AI相關的項目，推動AI技術的應用研發及技術轉移。

（二）「產業AI化」須由市場需求及應用場景帶動，才能把香港優秀的科研成果落到實處。「創新及科技基金」轄下的多項資助計劃覆蓋廣泛，為不同行業及企業各個發展階段的需要提供不同程度的技術和財政支援，更能靈活對應市場或企業對創新科技（包括AI）的需求，滿足科技變革及千行百業的應用場景。

除此之外，針對企業對加快數碼轉型、善用AI的殷切需求，政府致力優化現有與AI相關的資助計劃。例如「新型工業化資助計劃」已於去年六月優化，加快項目審批，支持企業善用科技（包括AI）升級轉型，至今已支持超過120條智能生產線。另外，「數碼轉型支援先導計劃」亦將加入AI及網絡安全數碼方案，鼓勵中小企應用AI提升競爭力。我們正草擬新一輪計劃的資助範圍和執行細節，預計於本年度內諮詢立法會。

（三）二○二五年《施政報告》提出成立的AI效能提升組會用好統籌協調的力量，指導政府部門於工作中有效應用人工智能技術、研究重組工作流程以及推動部門進行科技革新；並在不同政務環節推出數據分析、客戶服務及文書工作等通用AI工具，以提升效能，並更好地回應市民對高效政府和優質公共服務的期望。過程中，政府會與業界攜手合作，利用AI提供更優質、利民和便商的公共服務。AI效能提升組的目標是於在二○二六年內推出涵蓋100個政務環節的AI工具，並在二○二七年底前增加至不少於200個；以及在二○二六至二七及二○二七至二八年度內陸續推出AI旗艦項目，利用AI輔助部門加快處理及審批各類牌照和申請。

此外，數字政策辦公室會為「智方便」及「數碼企業身份」這兩個分別面向市民及企業的政府跨部門統一電子服務平台，提供「AI助手」，以用戶需求及數據為本，利用AI快捷地解答用戶查詢及提供個人化服務，當中「數碼企業身份」會為企業（特別是中小企）推薦合適的資助計劃和公共服務支援，協助企業降低營運成本。我們預期於今年內陸續推出上述電子服務優化措施。"
LCQ2: Promoting in-depth application of artificial intelligence in various trades and industries,2026-01-21 13:15,2026-01-21 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100304.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Sunny Tan and a reply by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

  The country's 2025 Report on the Work of the Government highlights the need to ""continuously advance the 'Artificial Intelligence Plus' (AI+) Initiative"", while last year's Policy Address emphasised promoting the development of AI+ and facilitating the extensive and deep integration and application of AI across different sectors. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the specific strategies to promote the extensive application of AI in the long run for supporting the digital transformation of traditional industries with competitive edge, such as the textiles industry, for which the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan have expressed support for upgrading;

(2) given that some members of the industry suggest that the authorities should consolidate, leverage and enhance the existing AI-related funding schemes, with a view to supporting traditional industries with competitive edge (particularly small and medium enterprises) in achieving transformation through the application of AI, whether the authorities will consider the relevant suggestions by introducing enhancement measures and increasing funding for the existing funding schemes, so as to encourage enterprises to enhance competitiveness through the application of AI; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) of the ways to leverage the AI+ strategy to enhance the cross-departmental service quality and efficiency of electronic government services (e-government services) as well as the level of data interoperability and application, such as applying AI in the business version of ""iAM Smart"" to directly identify funding schemes and e-government services applicable to an enterprise, and automatically assist the corporate user concerned in processing applications, thereby facilitating enterprises of different sizes to reduce operating costs and accelerating the service upgrade of traditional industries with competitive edge?

Reply:

President:

  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of Hong Kong's core industries. Over the past few years, pursuant to the strategy set out in the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint, we have been actively building a local AI ecosystem, focusing on ""strengthening infrastructure and promoting the application-oriented approach"" to enhance the synergy among the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors, and to fully drive Hong Kong's AI development on multiple dimensions. This development direction is also in line with the national ""AI+"" initiative.

  In response to the question from the Hon Sunny Tan, my reply is as follows.

(1) The Government's systematic AI framework, covering scientific research, computing power, data, talent and funding, provides strong support for Hong Kong to deepen its implementation of the ""AI+"" initiative and to better support and serve the national high-quality development agenda during the National 15th Five-Year Plan period. In particular, the 2025 Policy Address advocated stepping up promotion of AI applications with a view to achieving ""industries for AI"" and ""AI for industries"", which is precisely our ""AI+"" action agenda. The local technology parks which have attracted nearly 1 000 AI-related enterprises, have also provided significant momentum in the process.

  Taking traditional industries such as the textile industry as mentioned by the Hon Tan as an example, the Hong Kong Productivity Council has established the Hong Kong Industrial Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Centre, focusing on the development of industrial AI and robotics technologies and commercialisation. Projects currently being developed by the Centre cover AI application in various facets of the manufacturing industry, such as logistics, automated assembly, and inspection of product quality.

  Separately, the Government has been supporting traditional industries with competitive advantages in their digital transformation and smart upgrades through the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF). As of the end of last year, ITF has approved funding of over $1.4 billion for AI-related projects, strengthening the manufacturing sector's competitiveness and innovation capacity. At the same time, ITF has already funded more than 350 AI-related projects involving a total funding amount of around $1 billion to promote research and development (R&D) on AI application and AI technology transfer.

(2) ""AI for industries"" ought to be driven by market demand and application scenarios to put Hong Kong's excellent R&D outcomes into practice. The scope of the various funding schemes under the ITF are comprehensive, providing different levels of technical and financial support to meet the needs of various industries and enterprises at different stages of development. They can also flexibly respond to the demands from the market or enterprises for innovation technologies (including AI), catering for technological change and application scenarios of different sectors.

  In addition, to meet the pressing needs of enterprises for accelerating digital transformation and leveraging AI, the Government is committed to enhancing existing AI-related subsidy schemes. For example, the New Industrialisation Funding Scheme was enhanced in June last year to speed up the process of project approvals, supporting enterprises in leveraging technologies (including AI) for upgrading and transformation. The Scheme has supported over 120 smart production lines so far. Separately, the Digital Transformation Support Pilot Programme will include AI and cybersecurity digital solutions to encourage small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to use AI to enhance their competitiveness. We are currently drafting the scope of subsidies and implementation details for the new round of the programme, and expect to consult the Legislative Council within this year.

(3) The AI Efficacy Enhancement Team (AIEET) established per the 2025 Policy Address will leverage its planning and co-ordinating power to steer departments in effectively applying AI technologies in their work, exploring process re-engineering, and promoting technological reform in departments. Coupled with the launching of common AI tools over various government functions such as data analysis, customer service and document processing, overall efficacy will be enhanced, thereby better meeting public expectations for efficient administration and quality public services. In the process, the Government will work hand in hand with the industry to leverage AI to provide higher-quality public services that benefit the public and make it easier for businesses. The AIEET targets to launch AI tools covering 100 public administration procedures within 2026, and to expand to no fewer than 200 by end-2027. In addition, AI flagship projects will be rolled out progressively in 2026-27 and 2027-28 to use AI to assist departments in expediting the processes of handling, vetting and approval of various types of licences and permits, as well as applications.

  Additionally, the Digital Policy Office will provide ""AI Assistant"" for ""iAM Smart"" and ""Digital Corporate Identity (CorpID)"", the Government's interdepartmental unified electronic service platforms for the general public and businesses respectively. Based on users' needs and data, the AI Assistant will quickly answer users' enquiries and provide personalised services. In particular, the CorpID will recommend suitable subsidy schemes and public service support to enterprises (especially SMEs), helping them reduce operating costs. We expect to implement the above e-service enhancement measures gradually within this year."
立法會十三題：推廣樂齡科技的應用,2026-01-21 12:45,2026-01-21 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100238.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上鄧家彪議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉香港社會對「以老護老」的「雙老」家庭、「以殘護老」及「以老護殘」家庭的關注持續提升。行政長官於二○二五年《施政報告》中提及會為300户高風險住户安裝智能意外偵測系統（偵測系統），以及時發覺高風險長者的危險情況。此外，據報坊間也有團體與企業合作為長者住户安裝樂齡科技產品。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否為該等高風險住户安裝偵測系統訂立時間表；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

答覆：

主席：

政府透過多項措施致力加強支援照顧者和推廣樂齡科技的應用，包括向低收入家庭的照顧者提供照顧者津貼、加強暫託服務，以及設立專項基金，加強以樂齡科技服務有需要的群體等。就問題的八個部分，勞工及福利局（勞福局）經諮詢房屋局、香港房屋委員會（房委會）和香港房屋協會（房協）後，現回覆如下：

（一）及（八）照顧者是長者和殘疾人士在社區生活的重要支撐。勞福局致力支援護老者和殘疾人士照顧者，以減輕他們的身心壓力，同時為被照顧者提供更全面的照料。作為加強支援照顧者的其中一環，勞福局正按二○二五年《施政報告》所述，計劃為300‍戶高風險照顧者住戶試行安裝智能意外偵測系統。

勞福局期望在試行計劃下，透過科技應用，在照顧者及／或被照顧者遇上家居意外時，達致即時偵測、及早介入、迅速援助的效果。勞福局正積極進行籌備工作，預計最快二○二六年第一季公布具體安排，並為相關住戶試行安裝系統，爭取二○二六年第三季或之前為不少於300戶住戶完成安裝。

此外，政府二○一八年十二月以十億元設立「樂齡及康復創科應用基金」（基金），資助合資格安老及康復服務單位購置、租用或試用科技產品，以改善服務使用者的生活，並減輕護理人員及照顧者的負擔和壓力。二○二四至二五年度，政府向基金額外注資十億元，並擴闊其用途至適合家居使用的樂齡科技產品。至二○二五年十二月，基金合共批出超過9.1億元，資助約2100個安老及康復服務單位購置或租用合共超過27000項科技產品。

社會福利署（社署）二○二三年九月把「長者社區照顧服務券計劃」的適用範圍擴展至租用輔助科技產品，進一步促進樂齡科技應用於長者社區照顧服務。

在公共屋邨方面，房屋署除推行「物聯網長者住戶大門開關訊息系統」試行計劃外，亦積極探索新科技在樂齡安居方面的應用。例如，在部分屋邨的暢通易達洗手間以試點形式安裝智能監測跌倒系統，以偵測跌倒、暈厥或停留過久等情況。房委會也與香港警務處協作推廣「智蹤計劃」，推動高危長者使用定位裝置，預防走失及減輕其照顧者和家人的壓力。房屋署會繼續與其他政府部門及社福機構探討推行其他樂齡科技的可行性，以惠及更多長者住戶。房委會和房協亦會持續探討在其轄下出租屋邨應用更多智能技術方案，例如研究使用機械人協助搬運重物，以加強對長者住戶的支援。

（二）至（四）房委會向沒有領取綜合社會保障援助（綜援）的合資格長者住戶提供津貼安裝緊急警報系統（又名「平安鐘」），讓有需要長者在遇到緊急事故時可以迅速求助。房委會已將緊急警報系統津貼的應用範圍由傳統的緊急警報系統擴展至流動式的緊急警報系統，例如具備緊急警報系統的手機和手錶及具有安裝偵測跌倒功能的產品。長者住戶可自行選購，成功申請後會按實報實銷的方式，獲發一次性不超過2,500元的津貼。至二○二五年十一月底，房委會已批出超過26000宗申請。房委會並無備存申請者的年齡分布及所屬地區的分項統計。

另一方面，65歲或以上的綜援受助長者，如屬單身或與家人同住但乏人妥善照顧，可向社署申請特別津貼，支付安裝及使用室內或流動緊急召援系統的費用。60至64歲的綜援受助人，如屬單身或與家人同住但乏人妥善照顧，同時經公立醫院或診所醫生證明殘疾程度超過50%，或證明所患疾病有可能對生命構成威脅而需要他人即時援助，也可向社署申請相同特別津貼。

二○二○至二一至二○二四至二五年度，領取緊急召援系統津貼的綜援受助人數由32745人減至25543人，綜援長者個案數目亦由128863宗減少至110846宗。綜援受助人按自身情況決定是否申請緊急召援系統津貼，原因各有不同，不一而足。社署轄下社會保障辦事處職員會向合資格的綜援受助人介紹有關津貼，並協助他們申請。除綜援提供的津貼外，社會上不同機構也有向綜援人士提供類似的緊急警報系統援助。

社署沒有就綜援計劃下提供的緊急召援系統津貼指定任何供應商，有需要綜援人士可按其需求自行選購合適的緊急召援系統。另外，在「地區服務及關愛隊伍－支援長者及照顧者先導計劃」下，政府資助由關愛隊轉介的合資格長者及殘疾人士安裝及使用緊急召援服務。該服務由社署根據採購程序委聘的機構提供。社署根據服務合約監察相關服務的提供情況，並適時檢視及優化服務。

（五）至（七）房委會一直秉持「關懷為本」及與時並進的信念，積極探討便利長者的措施，應用創新科技多方面照顧長者住戶的需要。房委會二○二五年四月在觀塘區雲漢邨及何文田常樂邨開展「物聯網長者住戶大門開關訊息系統」試行計劃，為自願參與的長者住戶安裝系統，讓他們指定的親友，掌握有關長者進出居所的情況，及時提供適切支援。房委會亦可透過後台定期統計數據。有關計劃仍在試用階段，至今共有55戶獨居長者自願參與。至二○二五年十二月底，系統共發出四次長時間未開關大門的訊息，原因包括住戶遠行及住院後未停用感應器，並無涉及意外。

視乎住戶的參與情況及在資源許可下，房屋署會挑選合適的屋邨，擴展試行計劃並同步接收大門開關的訊息。房屋署會積極研究與其他政府部門及社福機構推行其他類似計劃的可行性，以推展至其他公共屋邨，惠及更多長者住戶。

過去五年（二○二一年至二○二五年十一月），在房委會轄下公共租住房屋單位內自然身故的個案數目載列如下。房屋署沒有備存相關人士的年齡、所屬地區或有否安裝緊急警報系統的分項統計。

Question:

It is learnt that there has been continued concern in Hong Kong society about families of elderly doubletons featuring ""the elderly taking care of the elderly"" as well as families with ""persons with disabilities taking care of elderly persons"" and families with ""elderly persons taking care of persons with disabilities"". The Chief Executive mentioned in the 2025 Policy Address that an intelligent accident detection system (detection system) would be installed for 300 high-risk households to detect dangerous situations involving high-risk elderly persons in a timely manner. In addition, it has been reported that some organisations have collaborated with enterprises in the community to install gerontechnology products for elderly households. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has set a timetable for installing the detection system for those high-risk households; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) of the number of households currently applying for the Housing Department's Grant for Emergency Alarm System (EAS Grant), with a breakdown by the number of elderly tenants in the relevant units, their districts of residence and age groups (each covering five years);

(3) given that in the reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on the Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 2025-2026, the Government indicated that the number of recipients of the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme receiving the EAS Grant had gradually decreased from the 2020-2021 financial year to the 2024-2025 financial year, whether the Government has studied the reasons for the decrease in the number of recipients;

(4) whether it has conducted performance assessments of organisations currently providing EAS (commonly known as ""ping on bell"") service; if so, of the standard of service provided by various organisations; if not, whether the Government will consider conducting such assessments of those organisations;

(5) of the number of households that have installed the Door Sensor Installation for Elderly Households (the sensor system) to date, with a breakdown by the number of elderly tenants in the relevant units and their districts of residence;

(6) whether the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) may receive the alerts issued by the sensor system simultaneously; if so, of the number of alerts issued by the sensor system to date, with a breakdown by the reasons for issuing alerts; if not, whether the Government will consider allowing HA to receive the relevant alerts simultaneously in the future;

(7) whether it has compiled statistics on the number of cases where elderly persons were found dead at home in the past five years, with a tabulated breakdown by their districts of residence, whether ""ping on bell"" was installed and the level of impairment under the Standardized Care Need Assessment Mechanism for Elderly Services; and

(8) apart from the detection system and the sensor system, whether the Government has considered further providing other practical gerontechnology products for elderly persons directly for free; if so, whether it has estimated the additional funding required; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Government strives to strengthen support for carers and promote the application of gerontechnology through various measures, including providing carers' allowance to carers from low-income families, enhancing respite services, as well as establishing a dedicated fund to foster the use of gerontechnology to serve the needy. The Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB), after consulting the Housing Bureau, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS), gives the following consolidated reply to the eight parts of the question:

(1)and (8)Carers play an important role in supporting elderly persons and persons with disabilities living in the community. The LWB is committed to supporting carers of elderly persons and persons with disabilities, with a view to alleviating their physical and mental stress, and at the same time providing care recipients with more comprehensive care. As part of the bigger effort to strengthen support for carers, the LWB is, in accordance with the 2025 Policy Address, planning to launch a pilot scheme to install intelligent accident detection systems for 300 high-risk carer households.

The LWB hopes to achieve in this pilot scheme, through the application of technology, immediate detection, timely intervention, and prompt assistance whenever home accidents befall carers and/or their care recipients. The LWB is actively undertaking preparatory work and expects to announce the detailed arrangements in the first quarter of 2026 at the earliest, followed by installation of systems for relevant households. We aim to complete such installation for no fewer than 300 households by or before the third quarter of 2026.

In addition, the Government set up the $1 billion Innovation and Technology Fund for Application in Elderly and Rehabilitation Care (the Fund) in December 2018 to subsidise eligible elderly and rehabilitation service units to procure, rent or trial technology products, so as to improve the quality of life of service users and reduce the burden and pressure of care staff and carers. In 2024-25, the Government injected additional $1 billion into the Fund and expanded its scope to cover technology products suitable for household use. As at December 2025, the Fund had allocated a total of about $910 million, subsidising about 2 100 elderly and rehabilitation service units to procure or rent over 27 000 technology products.

The Social Welfare Department (SWD) expanded the scope of the Community Care Service Voucher Scheme for the Elderly in September 2023 to cover rental of assistive technology products, thus further catalysing the use of gerontechnology in community care services for elderly persons.

As for the public rental housing (PRH) estates, apart from the Internet of Things (IoT) Door Sensor Installation for Elderly Households (the Scheme), the HD is actively exploring the use of new technologies in promoting elderly-friendly living. For instance, the HD has piloted the installation of smart fall-detection systems in some accessible toilets of some PRH estates to detect incidents such as falls, fainting, prolonged inactivity, etc. The HKHA has also collaborated with the Hong Kong Police Force to promote the Project PINPOINT which encourages the use of location devices for high-risk elderly individuals so as to prevent the elderly from missing and alleviating the stress of their carers and families. The HD will continue exploring the feasibility of implementing other gerontechnologies with other government departments and social welfare organisations with a view to benefiting more elderly residents. The HKHA and the HKHS will also continue looking into the application of more smart solutions in their rental estates, such as exploring the use of robots to assist in carrying heavy items to strengthen support for elderly residents.

(2) to (4)The HKHA provides eligible elderly households who do not receive Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) with subsidies to install Emergency Alarm Systems (EAS) (also known as ""Safety Bell""), so that the elderly in need are able to seek prompt assistance in case of emergency. The HKHA has extended the scope of the EAS subsidy to cover not only traditional EAS but also mobile EAS, such as mobile phones and watches equipped with EAS as well as products with fall detection function. Elderly households may purchase the said devices on their own. Successful applicants will be given a one-off subsidy of not more than $2,500 to cover the actual expenses. As at end November 2025, the HKHA had approved over 26 000 applications. The HKHA does not keep the breakdown of the age profile or the districts of the applicants.

On the other hand, for elderly CSSA recipients aged 65 or above, if they are single or living in a family with other family members who cannot take care of him/her, may apply for a special grant from the SWD to cover the fees for installing and using indoor or mobile EAS. CSSA recipients aged 60 to 64 may also apply for the same special grant from the SWD if they are single or living in a family with other family members who cannot take care of him/her and certified to be more than 50 per cent disabled or suffering from such medical conditions which, in the opinion of a doctor of a public hospital or clinic, may develop into life threatening conditions and require immediate attention.

From 2020-21 to 2024-25, the number of CSSA recipients receiving the grant for EAS dropped from 32 745 to 25 543, alongside the decrease in the number of CSSA elderly cases from 128 863 to 110 846. The CSSA recipients decide on whether to apply for the grant for EAS based on their individual circumstances with varying reasons. Staff at Social Security Field Units of SWD will provide eligible CSSA recipients with information on the relevant grant and facilitate their applications. Apart from the grant provided under CSSA, various organisations in society also offer CSSA recipients similar EAS assistance.

The SWD has not designated any service providers with regards the grant for EAS provided under the CSSA Scheme. CSSA recipients in need are free to purchase suitable EAS according to their needs. Separately, under the District Services and Community Care Teams - Pilot Scheme on Supporting Elderly and Carers, the Government subsidises eligible elderly persons and persons with disabilities referred by the Care Teams to install and use the emergency alarm services. Such services are provided by the designated service providers engaged by the SWD through established procurement procedures. The SWD monitors the provision of the services in accordance with the service contracts, as well as reviews and enhances the services as appropriate.

(5) to (7)The HKHA always upholds the values of ""caring"" and keeps pace with the times to actively explore measures that facilitate elderly persons and address various needs of elderly residents through the application of innovative technologies. In April 2025, the HKHA launched the Pilot Scheme of the IoT Door Sensor Installation for Elderly Households in Wan Hon Estate in Kwun Tong and Sheung Lok Estate in Ho Man Tin. The elderly households who voluntarily participated in the Scheme were equipped with the system which allows designated relatives or friends to keep track of the movement of the elderly concerned in and out of their flats and to provide timely support when needed. The HKHA may also conduct regular statistical analysis through its back-end systems. The Scheme concerned is still being run on a trial basis, with voluntary participation by a total of 55 elderly singleton households. As at end December 2025, four alerts were issued regarding prolonged periods of door inactivity. The said alerts did not involve any accidents, and were triggered by households' extended trips or hospitalisation without deactivating the sensors.

Subject to residents' participation and the availability of resources, the HD will identify suitable estates for expansion of the Pilot Scheme along with simultaneous receipt of door-opening/closing notifications. The HD will actively explore the feasibility of implementing other similar schemes in collaboration with other government departments and social welfare organisations, with a view to benefiting more elderly households in other PRH estates.

In the past 5 years (i.e. from 2021 to November 2025), the number of natural death cases recorded in PRH units under the HD is set out in the table below. HD does not maintain statistical breakdowns by age, district, or whether the concerned individuals had EAS installed.

立法會十七題：大型文化及體育設施的供應,2026-01-21 12:30,2026-01-21 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100249.htm,"​以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上霍啟剛議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，確保大型文化及體育（文體）設施的穩定供應是支持文化產業化發展的重要基礎。據報香港於二○二四年舉辦了超過210項盛事，而二○二四年至二○二五年上半年有超過285場大型演唱會在港舉行，粗略估算有超過390萬名觀眾，當中有超過140‍萬名旅客，為本港帶來約34億元的消費額及約19億元的經濟增加值。然而，現有大型文體設施的使用率恆常超過90%，反映該等設施的供應不足，有業界人士認為有關情況限制了舉辦大型活動的靈活性。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於根據《北部都會區行動綱領》，北部都會區（北都）的土地為在港建立世界級的文化設施和多元文化空間提供了新的機遇，而標誌性文化設施綜合項目和不同表演藝術專屬場地也會在新田科技城和北都建設，政府就該等文化及表演設施項目的具體計劃為何，包括已確認的大型文體設施選址、面積規模，以及預計落成年份及目前進度等；

（二）政府有否考慮優化「活化工廈計劃」，以為文藝創意業界提供進一步支持，包括推出便利措施支持在工業大廈舉行小型文化表演；

（三）鑑於香港首次參與承辦的第十五屆全國運動會和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會已完滿閉幕，政府有何計劃總結本港大型文體設施於該盛事中舉辦體育賽事的寶貴經驗和得益，以長遠推動本港與粵港澳大灣區其他內地城市的深度融合發展，為日後申辦國際文體盛事奠定基礎；

（四）《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》公布的24項完善文藝創意產業生態圈的措施至今的實施進度為何；有否評估該等措施對增加本港大型文體設施供應的具體貢獻為何；及

（五）鑑於《行政長官2024年施政報告》提出建設本港為國際體育盛事之都，為提升香港作為國際體育城市的產業競爭力，當局會否全面檢討大型文體設施的運作機制，包括選出重點設施進行市場化改革，以優化資源分配及應付增長的體育需求，從而全面支持本港文體產業化發展？

答覆：

主席：

就霍啟剛議員的提問，經諮詢發展局後，現回覆如下：

（一）及（四）文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）、康樂及文化事務署（康文署）及夥伴機構正積極推展《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》（《藍圖》）四個發展方向下的71項措施，包括發展方向4：完善文藝創意產業生態圈的24項措施。目前，《藍圖》各項措施實施進度良好，不少項目亦已取得標誌性的進展。

在增加大型文化設施供應方面，我們已逐步落實經改革的政府表演場地預訂政策，透過重塑表演場地定位為藝文界提供更切合時宜的使用空間。具體措施包括香港體育館（紅館）改為演唱會優先；東九文化中心作長期演出及藝術科技的重點場地；沙田大會堂演奏廳設為粵劇優先場地；以及優化康文署的「場地伙伴計劃」。我們期望為不同演藝團體和演唱會主辦單位提供更多檔期，並配合發展盛事（包括演唱會）經濟、推動文旅融合等新政策目標。

另外，我們亦投放資源興建和優化文化設施。其中，正在興建並預計於二○二六年落成的西九演藝中心，其大劇院、中劇場和小劇場將分別提供1 450個、600個和270個座位。康文署亦正有序推進多項在北部都會區建設文化設施的計劃，興建中的項目包括天水圍香港文保中心（前稱文物修復資源中心）和粉嶺新界東文化中心。天水圍香港文保中心預計於二○二八年啟用，將提升康文署在蒐集、保存、研究和展示文物方面的功能，亦作為培育青年人和推動文化交流的平台，為本地文物修復的發展注入新動力。粉嶺新界東文化中心則預計於二○三○年啟用，作為一所多功能專業表演場地，有利成為香港與大灣區藝團的合作共創項目的平台。

此外，我們正積極與國家相關博物館對接，為推進在古洞北設立介紹國家發展和成就的博物館做好前期籌劃。

長遠而言，政府正研究在新田科技城興建一個大型文化設施綜合項目，涵蓋主要博物館、表演場館、圖書館，匯聚本地及國際級豐富多元的展覽及表演節目，進一步鞏固香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心的地位。

同時，為配合北部都會區的發展，政府已預留土地發展多項體育及康樂設施，包括體育館、游泳池，以及提供劍擊訓練和比賽的設施等，以滿足市民的康體需要、舉辦體育賽事及為本地運動員提供練習場地。以上設施可充份利用位處北部都會區策略位置，加強與大灣區的協作與交流，有助推動香港體育發展。

政府會持續審視規劃中的工程項目的緩急優次，並適時更新工程時間表，以更有效運用公共資源。

（二）政府透過研究放寬不同場地的限制，提供更多表演和展覽場地，例如容許戲院用作現場表演。根據現行法例，戲院若用作現場表演，院商須預先向食物環境衞生署（食環署）申請及獲其批出一次過特別准許，視乎是否需要搭設臨時建築物，需時至少18或42個工作天。為進一步簡化有關申請程序，文創產業發展處於二○二五年七月協調有關部門（包括食環署、消防處及屋宇署）與香港戲院商會會面商議簡化程序。食環署現正積極推進與各部門擬定申請表以便利院商提交申請。

至於工業大廈（工廈）方面，政府在二○一八年重啟的「活化工廈計劃」，主要有重建和整幢改裝兩方面。如重建一九八七年前落成的工廈，而研究後證明技術可行並獲城市規劃委員會批准，重建地積比可增加最多兩成。至於整幢改裝樓齡15年或以上和位處「商業」或「工業」等地帶的工廈，可免收地契豁免書費用，如該工廈建於一九八七年或以後，須撥出改裝後樓面的一成以供作政府認可用途包括文化藝術或創意產業。針對業權分散未有計劃重建或改裝的工廈，現有政策容許工廈個別單位業主在無須向地政總署申請短期地契豁免書和繳付任何費用的情況下，可把單位用作藝術工作室（例如作藝術表演的排練場地）等五項用途（註一），但考慮到有關工廈其他單位仍可用作工業用途，基於公眾安全考慮，不可包括直接提供服務或貨品等會吸引公眾到訪的用途或活動（包括公開表演）。發展局正與規劃署和地政總署進行新一輪工廈研究，今年內提出建議，包括「活化工廈計劃」未來路向。

政府會繼續研究放寬不同場地的限制，以開拓更多場地空間。

（三）香港首次連同廣東和澳門共同承辦第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會），充分利用啟德體育園及其他現有體育設施，同時展現粵港澳三地城市發揮大灣區的優勢，以及香港具備舉辦大型體育盛事的條件和能力。十五運會和殘特奧會的辦賽經驗不但進一步提升香港舉辦大型盛事的能力，更可深化粵港澳三地的體育合作和大灣區的融合發展。

在十五運會期間，香港特區政府與國家體育總局、廣東省人民政府、澳門特區政府簽署《關於加強體育合作、促進融合發展的協議》（《四方協議》），加強粵港澳大灣區的體育交流和融合發展，當中包括在體育資源整合、賽事聯合舉辦等方面進一步深度合作。在《四方協議》的戰略框架下，三地各政府部門及體育總會的交流將會更頻繁，為將來香港與大灣區進一步合作舉辦大型盛事奠定堅實的基礎。

（五）特區政府一直重視體育發展，並致力於優化相關設施的運作機制，以確保資源能有效分配、滿足體育需求以及促進體育產業的增長。

隨着啟德體育園的啟用以及十五運會和殘特奧會的成功舉辦，香港在大型體育設施規劃和籌辦國際級賽事方面的經驗得以進一步加強。政府將善用啟德體育園等基建，吸引更多國際體育盛事落戶香港，強化「體育+盛事」經濟效益，鞏固香港作為國際體育盛事之都的地位，並貢獻體育產業化的發展。

此外，《行政長官2025年施政報告》提出在康文署指定設施引入市場營運模式，提供更多元的增值活動；並會探討邀請市場參與，提升鯉魚門公園度假營的營運及在指定試點營運沙灘，以建設康樂休閒及水上活動熱點。康文署已選取八個轄下的康文設施，包括香港藝術館、香港文化中心、遮打花園、啟德車站廣場等，引入商業元素及靈活地提供更多元的增值活動，提升吸引力，支持本港文體產業化的發展。

註一：其餘用途為辦公室（設計及媒體製作）、辦公室（影音錄製室）、辦公室（只限於「特定創意產業」，包括設計及媒體製作公司、印刷及出版業、電影公司和與電影業有關的行業組織）、以及研究所、設計及發展中心。"
Speech by DSJ at conference on The Future of Hong Kong Economy (English only) (with photo),2026-01-21 12:30,2026-01-21 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100281.htm,"Following is the keynote speech by the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, at the Thought Leadership Conference Series: The Future of Hong Kong Economy organised by the University of Hong Kong (HKU) Business School today (January 21):

Professor Wong (the Provost and Deputy Vice-Chancellor of HKU and Director of the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy, Professor Richard Wong), Professor Cai (the Dean and Chair of Economics of the HKU Business School, Professor Cai Hongbin), Professor Mokyr (the recipient of the 2025 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, Professor Joel Mokyr), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. I am most pleased to address such a distinguished audience today at the conference on The Future of Hong Kong Economy 2026.

The year 2026 unfolds against a global backdrop of complexity and uncertainty. Issues like geopolitical tensions, supply chain shifts and tariff disputes are reshaping the flow of capital and the operation of businesses. Yet history shows that Hong Kong's prosperity has always been fuelled by embracing changes, and by turning challenges into opportunities.

This leads me to the theme today - how Hong Kong can continue to serve as a trusted platform for business growth in the region and beyond. Please allow me to structure my remarks around three ""C""s: Certainty, Capability, and Connectivity.

Certainty - rule of law as economic bedrock

The first and most fundamental ""C"" is Certainty.

For businesses to thrive and economies to flourish, we need above all a predictable environment: certainty in contracts, in dispute resolution and in the enforcement of rights and obligations. In short, certainty is underpinned by the rule of law.

Hong Kong's success as an international financial, trading, and legal services centre is inseparable from its solid rule-of-law foundation. Our common law system, constitutionally guaranteed under the Basic Law, has been operating with integrity for over 180 years here. Judicial independence, equality before the law, and respect for contractual freedom are core values that we all treasure.

In an era when businesses must navigate multiple jurisdictions and political risks, Hong Kong offers something unique: a stable, bilingual, and internationally trusted legal environment. As the only common law jurisdiction within China, and the only one operating fully in both Chinese and English, Hong Kong provides unparalleled credibility and convenience for cross-border transactions.

Under the Basic Law, free flow of capital is guaranteed. Investments and properties in Hong Kong are protected by a robust regulatory regime administered by bodies including the Securities and Futures Commission and the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

The jurisprudence of the Hong Kong courts commands high respect in other common law jurisdictions. In a recent judgement, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council sitting in London referred to and discussed no fewer than six Hong Kong decisions from the past few years when determining insolvency issues raised in an appeal before it. This credibility is reflected in our consistent global standing - Hong Kong ranks among the top jurisdictions globally for business legislation and dispute resolution, making us the world's second-most preferred seat for arbitration and number one in the Asia-Pacific region.

Legal certainty is also a strategic enabler that allows businesses to plan long term, deploy capital with confidence, and innovate without fear. This foundation makes Hong Kong the ideal international legal hub for proactive collaboration in an era where ""safe passage"" for capital is more critical than ever.

Capability - professional services powering economic growth

Building on certainty comes the second ""C"": Capability.

Hong Kong's professional services ecosystem - spanning across legal, finance, accounting, tax, risk management, and dispute resolution - is one of our most powerful strengths. Their quality services are integral to value creation - by empowering businesses to manage risks effectively, tackling compliance issues skilfully, structuring transactions securely, and resolving disputes efficiently.

Our legal profession is international in outlook and local in insight. Our financial and accounting professionals operate to global standards while understanding regional realities. Together, they provide end-to-end support across the entire business lifecycle - from market entry and project financing, to management of an intellectual property rights portfolio, regulatory compliance, restructuring, and cross-border dispute resolution.

In a world of tariff disputes, sanctions, and regulatory divergence, companies increasingly rely on professional services to navigate complexity. Whether expanding into ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), the Middle East, Africa, or other markets, businesses require bespoke solutions - solutions that are legally sound, commercially viable, and culturally informed.

This is precisely where Hong Kong excels. We are home to a deep pool of professionals, recently ranked first in Asia and fourth globally under the IMD (International Institute for Management Development) World Talent Ranking.

Our professionals speak the universal language of business, with clear understanding of the nuances of different legal systems, market practices, and risk profiles. We have over 13 000 local lawyers and over 1 500 foreign lawyers from over 30 jurisdictions, including some 500 from the Chinese Mainland as well as more than 80 foreign law firms. Furthermore, we have a unique asset - over 600 lawyers with dual qualifications to practice in both Hong Kong and the Mainland cities of the Greater Bay Area.

In my view, an enterprise expanding globally is like a gentleman visiting a tailor shop for an impeccable suit. An off-the-rack solution simply does not work. What businesses need, and Hong Kong can offer, is a bespoke experience - professional services that cater to the client's needs and execute with precision to ensure a perfect fit for every occasion.

Connectivity - GoGlobal and Hong Kong's strategic role

This brings me to the third ""C"": Connectivity.

Hong Kong has long been described as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"". It highlights Hong Kong's crucial role under the ""one country, two systems"" in connecting the Chinese Mainland with the rest of the world.

In recent years, the Government has taken proactive steps to strengthen this role by supporting enterprises, particularly Mainland enterprises, to use Hong Kong as a launch pad for global expansion.

Under the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, I have been tasked to promote our legal services and co-ordinate with other professional sectors to meet the going global needs of Mainland enterprises.

To this end, we launched the Hong Kong Professional Services GoGlobal Platform last December. It serves two major functions:

(1) Information integration: We make information on professional services providers and their capability easily accessible to enterprises. At the launch ceremony of the Platform, we published a collection of over 50 success stories covering a wide range of sectors and extensive markets including Asia, Middle East and Africa.

(2) Needs matching: We enhance co-ordination to meet the specific needs of enterprises. For instance, I recently led a cross-professional delegation to Shenzhen for a direct exchange between our experts and Mainland enterprises. This initiative was well-received.

Earlier this month, we also established the Expert Committee on Professional Services for Going Global, comprising experts from relevant fields, to advise me on our strategy to promote Hong Kong as the premier two-way platform for attracting investment and going global.

Looking ahead

Ladies and gentlemen, as we consider Hong Kong's economic outlook in 2026, we should neither be complacent nor pessimistic. The challenges are real. But so are our strengths.

The certainty under our rule of law infrastructure instils trust. The capability of our professional services delivers solutions. The connectivity through our GoGlobal initiatives provides opportunities.

The relationship between law and the economy is practical, dynamic, and deeply intertwined. A resilient economy requires a credible legal system. A modern legal system must serve real economic needs. In Hong Kong, these two have grown together - and they will continue to do so.

With continued collaboration among the Government, businesses, and the professional community, I am sure that Hong Kong will not only navigate the present uncertainties, but emerge stronger, more relevant, and more connected to the world.

On that note, I wish you all a fruitful conference today and continued success in your endeavours. Thank you very much.  "
LCQ17: Supply of major cultural and sports facilities,2026-01-21 12:30,2026-01-21 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100250.htm,"​Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Fok and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

There are views that ensuring a stable supply of major cultural and sports (C&S) facilities is an important foundation for supporting the industrialisation of the cultural sector. It is reported that Hong Kong hosted over 210 mega events in 2024, and that more than 285 large-scale pop concert performances were held in the city between 2024 and the first half of 2025. Rough estimates suggest that these concerts attracted over 3.9 ‍million spectators, including more than 1.4 million tourists, generating approximately $3.4 billion in local spending and contributing around $1.9 ‍billion in value added to the local economy. However, utilisation rates at existing major C&S facilities have consistently exceeded 90 per cent, reflecting an insufficient supply of such facilities. Some members of the sectors consider that this situation has constrained the flexibility with which major events can be staged. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that, according to the Northern Metropolis Action Agenda, the land resources in the Northern Metropolis (NM) offer new opportunities to develop world-class cultural facilities and a pluralistic cultural environment in Hong Kong, and that an iconic cultural complex and various dedicated performing venues will also be built in the San Tin Technopole and the NM, of the Government's specific plans for such cultural and performance facility projects, including the confirmed sites for major C&S facilities, their respective sizes and scales, the anticipated years of completion and the current progress of such projects;

(2) whether the Government has considered enhancing the Revitalisation Scheme for Industrial Buildings to provide further support for the arts, cultural and creative sectors, including introducing facilitation measures to support the staging of small-scale cultural performances in industrial buildings;

(3) given the successful conclusion of the 15th National Games, the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games, in which Hong Kong participated for the first time as a co-host, what plans the Government has in place to consolidate the valuable experience and benefits gained from hosting sports events at Hong Kong's major C&S facilities during the Games, with a view to promoting in-depth integration and development between Hong Kong and other Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area over the long term, and laying the groundwork for future bids to host major international C&S events;

(4) of the progress made to date in implementing the 24 measures announced in the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development to enhance the ecosystem for arts, culture and creative industries; whether it has assessed the specific contribution of these measures to increasing the supply of major C&S facilities in Hong Kong; and

(5) given the proposal in ""The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address"" to build Hong Kong into a centre for mega international sports events, whether the authorities will, with a view to enhancing Hong Kong's industrial competitiveness as an international sports city, conduct a comprehensive review of the operating mechanisms of major C&S facilities, including identifying key facilities for market-oriented reform, so as to optimise resource allocation and meet the growing demand for sports, thereby providing full support for the industrialisation of Hong Kong's C&S sectors?

Reply：

President：

In consultation with the Development Bureau, the reply to the question raised by the Hon Kenneth Fok is as follows:

(1) and (4) The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) and partner organisations have been actively taking forward the 71 measures under the four strategic directions of the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development (Blueprint), including the 24 measures under Strategic Direction 4 ""Enhance the Ecosystem for the Arts, Culture and Creative Industries"". At present, the implementation of various Blueprint measures is of good progress and significant development has been achieved for many of them.

On increasing the supply of large-scale culture facilities, we have implemented the reformed hiring policy for public performance venues progressively, providing spaces that better cater for arts and cultural activities of the time through repositioning the performance venues. Specific measures include refocusing the Hong Kong Coliseum to prioritise concerts; positioning the East Kowloon Cultural Centre as a signature venue for long-running performances and arts technology; according priority for Cantonese opera at the Sha Tin Town Hall Auditorium; and enhancing the LCSD's Venue Partnership Scheme. We hope to provide more slots for different arts groups and concert organisers, and align with the new policy objectives as developing mega events (including concerts) economy and promoting the integration of culture and tourism.

In addition, we have also dedicated resources in developing and enhancing culture facilities. Currently under construction and scheduled to be completed in 2026, the WestK Performing Arts Centre (WestK PAC) will provide a 1 450-seat Grand Theatre, a 600-seat Medium Theatre and a 270-seat Studio Theatre. The LCSD is also implementing multiple projects on the development of culture facilities in the Northern Metropolis in an orderly manner. Projects under construction include the Hong Kong Conservation Repository (formerly the Heritage Conservation and Resource Centre) in Tin Shui Wai and the New Territories East Cultural Centre in Fanling. The Hong Kong Conservation Repository in Tin Shui Wai is expected to come into operation in 2028. The Repository will enhance the institutional capacity and elevate the position of the LCSD in the acquisition, preservation, research, and display of artefacts, as well as serving as a platform to nurture young people and encourage cultural exchanges, thereby injecting new impetus into the development of conservation profession in Hong Kong. The New Territories East Cultural Centre in Fanling is expected to open in 2030. It will serve as a multi-purpose professional performance venue, providing an interactive platform facilitating collaborations among arts groups from Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area (GBA).

Besides, we are working proactively with relevant museums in the Chinese Mainland on the preparatory works for establishing the museum showcasing the development and achievements of our country in Kwu Tung North.

In the long run, the Government is exploring the establishment of a large-scale cultural complex in San Tin Technopole, which includes a major museum, a performance venue and a library, bringing together a diverse and world-class array of local and international exhibitions and performances, further consolidating Hong Kong's position as the East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange.

In the meantime, to support the development of the Northern Metropolis, the Government has reserved sites for developing various sports and recreation facilities, including sports centres, swimming pools, and facilities for fencing training and competition. These facilities will meet the sports and recreation needs of the community, support the staging of sports events, and provide training venues for local athletes. Making best use of their strategic locations in the Northern Metropolis, they can strengthen the collaboration and exchange with the GBA, thereby contributing to the sports development in Hong Kong.

The Government will continue to review the order of priority of works projects under planning and update their works schedules as appropriate so as to make more effective use of public resources.

(2) The Government has been exploring ways to relax restrictions of different venues to open up more spaces for performances and exhibitions, such as allowing cinemas to be used for live performances. According to the prevailing laws, if a cinema is to be used for live performances, its operator must apply for and obtain from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) a one-off special permission prior to the live performances. Depending on whether temporary structures need to be erected, the approval process takes at least 18 or 42 working days. To further streamlining the application procedures, the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency had convened a meeting in July 2025 rounding up the relevant Government departments (including the FEHD, the Fire Services Department and the Buildings Department) and the Hong Kong Theatres Association to identify room for streamlining. The FEHD has been actively working with the relevant departments to draw up a standard application form to facilitate the submission of application by operators.

In respect of the industrial buildings (IBs), the Revitalisation Scheme for IBs reactivated by the Government in 2018 comprises two aspects of redevelopment and wholesale conversation. For redevelopment of IBs constructed before 1987, subject to technical feasibility study and approval by the Town Planning Board, the plot ratio after redevelopment may be increased by up to 20 per cent. As regards to wholesale conversation of IBs aged 15 years or above in ""Commercial"" or ""Industrial"" zones, waiver fees may be exempted, and if the IB was constructed in or after 1987, 10 per cent of the converted floor space must be used for purposes designated by the Government including arts and cultural or creative industries.In respect of IBs with fragmented ownership and no redevelopment or conversation plans, the prevailing policy allows owner of individual IB units to use the units, without having to apply for a short-term waiver from the Lands Department(LandsD) and pay waiver fees, for five specified uses (Note 1), which include ""Art Studio"" (e.g. rehearsal space for art performances). However, considering that the other units in the concerned IB may still be used for industrial purposes and in view of public safety, the uses do not include any uses or activities that directly provide services or goods to attract public visits (including public performance). The Development Bureau is conducting a new round of study on industrial stock with the Planning Department and the LandsD, and will put forward recommendations this year, including the way forward for the Revitalisation Scheme for IBs.

The Government will continue to explore ways to relax restrictions of different venues to open up more venue spaces.

(3) Hong Kong co-hosted the 15th National Games (NG), and the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NGDSO) with Guangdong and Macao for the first time, making full use of the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) and other existing sports facilities, and showcasing how cities in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao leverage their advantages in the GBA. It also demonstrated the capabilities of Hong Kong in hosting major sports events. The experience from co-hosting the NG and the NGDSO not only enhanced Hong Kong's ability to organise mega events, but also deepened sports exchanges among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao and promoted the integrated development of GBA.

During the NG, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government, the Macao SAR Government and the People's Government of Guangdong Province signed the agreement with the General Administration of Sport of China on the strengthening of sports co-operation and promotion of integrated development (the Four-Party Agreement). The Four-Party Agreement aims to bolster sports exchanges and the integrated development of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao GBA, including further collaboration in areas such as consolidation of sports resources and joint hosting of sports competitions. Under the strategic framework of the Four-Party Agreement, there will be more frequent exchanges between government departments and sports associations of the three places, laying a solid foundation for future co-operation between Hong Kong and GBA to co-host major events.

(5) The Government has all along attached great importance to sports development and is committed to optimising the operation mechanism of relevant facilities to ensure effective resource allocation, meet the demand for sports and promote the development of the sports industry.

With the commissioning of KTSP and the successful conclusion of the NG and the NGDSO, Hong Kong's experience in planning large-scale sports infrastructure and organising international-level competitions has been enhanced. The Government will make best use of KTSP and other sports infrastructures to attract more major international sports events to be held in Hong Kong, driving economic benefits from ""sports + mega events"" development, reinforcing Hong Kong's status as the centre for major international sports events and contributing to the development of sports as an industry.

Moreover, ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" announced that market-based business models will be introduced into designated facilities of the LCSD to provide more diverse value-added activities. Feasibility of engaging the market to enhance the operations of the Lei Yue Mun Park holiday camp and selected beaches will also be explored to promote the development of recreational, leisure and aquatic hotspots. The LCSD has designated eight leisure and cultural facilities under their management, including the Hong Kong Museum of Art, the Hong Kong Cultural Centre, the Chater Garden, the Kai Tak Station Square, for introducing commercial elements and flexibly providing more diverse value-added activities to enhance their attractiveness in support of the development of Hong Kong's cultural and sports industries.

Banking industry introduces enhancements to elderly-friendly and barrier-free services,2026-01-21 12:00,2026-01-21 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012000698.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) announced today (January 21) that the banking industry will implement the Guideline on Elderly-friendly Banking Services and the second edition of the Practical Guideline on Barrier-free Banking Services to strengthen support for the elderly and customers with impairment in accessing banking services. Both industry guidelines are issued by the HKAB and endorsed by the HKMA.

The Guideline on Elderly-friendly Banking Services aims to establish pragmatic elderly-friendly standards in support of the Government's efforts in promoting silver economy (Note 1), which sets out eight core principles (Note 2)and a number of recommended good practices for implementation by banks. It also aims at enhancing elderly customers' financial literacy and digital adoption through strengthening financial education. The second edition of the Practical Guideline on Barrier-free Banking Services introduces enhancements to barrier-free banking services, with a view to facilitating access to appropriate banking services for customers with different needs, including persons with physical, visual and hearing impairments, as well as the elderly.

Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA Mr Arthur Yuensaid, ""The HKMA has been working closely with the banking industry to promote financial inclusion. Building on the industry's practical experience accumulated over the years, the two guidelines cover multiple measures that help further enhance customers' banking experience. The HKMA expects banks to continue upholding the principle of treating customers fairly amid the development of digital services, and to provide more convenient and inclusive banking services for the elderly and other customers with special needs.""

  The Chairman of the HKAB, and Vice Chairman and Chief Executive of Bank of China (Hong Kong),Mr Sun Yu,said, ""To foster a more customer-friendly service environment and provide appropriate banking services for elderly customers and those with special needs, the HKAB has worked closely with regulators and relevant stakeholders to proactively introduce related measures, with a view to offering more caring and convenient banking services. The HKAB will continue to enhance the relevant service guidelines to keep up with social and technological changes, further driving the development of financial inclusion.""

Note 1: The introduction of an industry guideline for elderly-friendly banking services was set out in the 2025-26 Budget.
Note 2: The eight core principles include digital enablement, accessibility of basic services, distribution of physical banking facilities, transparency of authorisation information, education and outreach, staff training, customer communication and protection, as well as elderly-friendly design."
LCQ22: Protecting digital platform workers,2026-01-21 11:38,2026-01-21 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100230.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Lam Wai-kong and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

  The Chief Executive stated in the 2025 Policy Address that efforts would be made to improve the work injury compensation mechanism for digital platform workers by way of legislation. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the progress of the legislative work for improving the work injury compensation mechanism for digital platform workers; the latest update of the authorities' consultation with relevant trade unions;

(2) whether it will require digital platform companies to provide work injury protection to digital platform workers at a level not less than the amount of compensation provided in the Employees' Compensation Ordinance (Cap. 282); if so, of the details; if not, whether the Government has explored other compensation options; and

(3) as it is learnt that over 10 000 digital platform workers in Hong Kong are currently engaged in delivery services for food and goods delivery digital platforms, and there are views that although there are ""facts surrounding the employment"" between the workers and the platform companies, the workers still accept orders as self-employed persons or freelancers, and are unable to fully enjoy statutory labour protection, resulting in the need for the court to determine whether an employment relationship exists between the two parties when disputes arise between them, whether the authorities will further consider affirming the presence of an employment relationship between platform companies and food delivery workers through legislation; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  As announced in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, the Government will improve the work injury compensation (WIC) mechanism for digital platform workers (DPWs) through legislation. The Government has established the Tripartite Committee for the Digital Platform Industry (Tripartite Committee), which comprises representatives from the Government, platform companies and labour organisations, to explore issues in relation to digital platform work and render opinions on the legislative work of the Government. In response to the Member's question, the reply is provided below:

(1) The Government plans to introduce new legislation to provide protection for DPWs who sustain injuries or die as a result of work. As the legislative proposal involves novel legal concept, the Government needs to fully consult relevant stakeholders. The Labour Department has since last October been collecting views from stakeholders on the major issues of the legislative framework through the Tripartite Committee meeting and held separate meetings with platform companies, labour organisations, the insurance sector and academics to further exchange views. The Government is taking forward the relevant law drafting work at full steam and aims to submit the legislative proposal to the Legislative Council within this year.

(2) As DPWs at present mainly engage in food and goods delivery work, the Government proposes focusing on the formulation of a WIC mechanism for the abovementioned DPWs and taking forward the matter in accordance with the following basic principles:

(i) The compensation mechanism shall provide clear legal foundation and certainty to the protection afforded to DPWs who sustain injuries or die as a result of work;

(ii) the coverage, items and details of compensation shall enhance the protection for DPWs while taking into consideration the affordability of platform companies, thereby facilitating the sustainable and stable development of the digital platform industry; and

(iii) the implementation arrangements should be simple, easy to understand and operate so as to minimise disputes over compensation.

  The Government will make reference to the Employees' Compensation Ordinance (Cap. 282) and carefully consider views from stakeholders when formulating the relevant legislative framework.

(3) Digital platform service is a newly-developed economic operation model which changes rapidly. The relationship between a platform company and a DPW cannot be easily defined with reference to that of an ordinary employer-employee relationship. The Government's overriding mission at present is to take forward the legislative proposal at full steam to improve the WIC mechanism for DPWs for enhancing their protection. The Government will continue to make good use of the Tripartite Committee to explore other issues of platform work which are of common concern to the stakeholders."

問題：

行政長官於二○二五年《施政報告》指出，推動以立法方式完善數碼平台工作者工傷補償機制。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）完善數碼平台工作者工傷補償機制的立法工作進度為何；政府向相關工會進行諮詢的最新情況為何；

（二）會否規定數碼平台公司向數碼平台工作者提供不少於《僱員補償條例》（第282章）所訂補償額的工傷保障；如會，詳情為何；如否，政府有否研究其他補償方案；及

（三）據悉本港現時有逾萬名數碼平台工作者從事食物及貨物送遞數碼平台的送遞工作，有意見認為他們雖然與平台公司存在「用工事實」，但仍以自僱人士或自由工作者身分接單，未能充分享有法定勞工保障，令他們與平台公司出現糾紛時，需由法庭判斷雙方是否存在僱傭關係，政府會否進一步研究透過立法形式確定平台公司與食物外送員之間的僱傭關係；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

《行政長官2025年施政報告》宣布政府會以立法方式完善數碼平台工作者（平台工作者）的工傷補償機制。政府已成立包括政府、平台公司及勞工團體代表的數碼平台行業三方小組（三方小組），共同探討與數碼平台工作有關的課題，並為政府的立法工作提供意見。就議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）政府計劃制定新法例，為因工受傷或死亡的平台工作者提供保障。由於立法建議涉及嶄新的法律概念，政府須充分諮詢持份者的意見。勞工處自去年十月起經三方小組會議聽取持份者對立法框架主要事項的意見；其後亦分別與平台公司、勞工團體、保險業界及學者會面，作進一步交流。政府現正全力推進相關的法例草擬工作，以期於今年內向立法會提交立法建議。

（二）由於現時平台工作者主要從事食物和貨物送遞工作，政府建議先聚焦為上述平台工作者制定工傷補償機制，並按以下基本原則推進：

（i）補償機制須為平台工作者因工受傷或死亡可獲的保障提供明確法律基礎及確定性；

（ii）補償範圍、項目及內容須加強保障平台工作者，同時須顧及平台公司的承擔能力，讓數碼平台行業可持續及穩定發展；以及

（iii）執行安排應簡單易明及容易操作，減少意外補償爭議。

政府擬定有關立法框架時，會參考《僱員補償條例》（香港法例第282章），並充分考慮持份者的意見。

（三）數碼平台服務是新發展的經濟運作模式，並且變化迅速，平台公司與平台工作者之間的關係，不易以一般的僱傭關係界定。政府目前首要工作是全力推展完善平台工作者工傷補償機制的立法建議，加強保障平台工作者。政府會繼續通過三方小組，探討持份者共同關注的其他平台工作相關議題。"

答覆：

主席：

露宿是複雜的社會問題，涉及不同政策局及部門的範疇，當中包括露宿者的住宿、福利、醫療等方面的服務需要，以至於地區層面跨部門的統籌行動。各政府部門及地區服務單位一直緊密合作，協力支援露宿人士。

就管浩鳴議員提問的各部分，現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）社會福利署（社署）的「露宿者電腦資料系統」（資料系統）整合社署及其津助的個案服務單位和專門為露宿者提供服務的非政府機構所呈報的資料。相關社工透過外展或轉介主動接觸露宿者後，會就露宿者的福利需要作出專業評估，並將有關資料輸入資料系統內。社署自二○二三‍年起要求服務單位每年須檢視資料系統內所有已登記露宿者的個案，並適時更新資料，以便進行更準確的服務規劃。過去五年，由該些服務單位呈報的露宿者人數，按地區、性別、年齡組別及露宿原因劃分，分別載於附件表一至表四；而首三個最多露宿者的區議會分區及其佔露宿者總人數的百分比載於表五。資料系統沒有備存露宿者的國籍資料。

（三）至（九）社署津助非政府機構營辦三隊露宿者綜合服務隊（服務隊），為全港露宿者提供福利支援服務。服務隊在日間及深宵進行外展探訪，主動接觸露宿者，了解其露宿的原因，並按他們的實際需要及接受服務的意願，提供綜合服務，包括輔導、服務轉介、短期住宿、經濟援助等，以解決露宿者的緊急福利需要，協助他們脫離露宿生活，重新融入社會。過去五年，服務隊的外展探訪次數、接觸的露宿者人數、經服務隊跟進後而脫離露宿的個案數目，以及有關津助露宿者綜合服務的開支載於表六。

社署亦津助非政府機構營辦短期宿舍，為露宿者提供短期過渡性住宿，並透過輔導及諮詢，協助他們過渡到穩定的住宿安排。過去五年，按性別劃分的社署津助及非政府機構以自負盈虧方式營運的宿位數目及津助宿位的平均入住率分別載於表七及表八。由於露宿者及轉介社工可直接向宿舍申請服務，無需中央輪候，因此，社署沒有備存宿舍的入住時間、各區宿位的輪候人數及輪候時間的資料。社署亦沒有備存服務隊提供轉介服務、露宿者租住私人樓宇、獲推薦編配公共租住房屋或參加其他住宿援助計劃的資料。

露宿者露宿的原因不盡相同，例如因為失業或租金昂貴以致無法找到可負擔的居所、與家人出現關係問題而選擇露宿生活、離開醫院／監獄／戒毒所而未有固定居所、不穩定的經濟狀況、便利上班及尋找工作、因精神健康或吸毒問題而缺乏意欲脫離露宿生活，或希望留在熟悉的社群中生活等。隨着相關困難或住宿問題獲得解決，部分露宿者會選擇脫離露宿生活，重新融入社會，露宿者人數因而會有所回落。

為優化露宿者的福利支援服務，社署自二○二○至二一年度起向服務隊增撥資源，以增加社工、精神科護士及司機人手和相關項目的撥款，並增加短期宿舍的名額至228個。津助宿舍最長的入住期一般為六個月，社工會因應個別露宿者的福利需要延長住宿期，直至他們順利落實適切的住宿計劃。社署會繼續密切留意露宿者的福利服務需要，並與持份者及相關政府部門保持溝通和合作，按露宿者的需要提供適切的福利支援服務，以協助他們重建生活。"

Question:

 It has been reported that a study has pointed out that there is a lack of support services in Hong Kong society to address the needs of street sleepers, and that the number of hostel places provided for them falls short of demand. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of street sleepers registered under the Computerised Street Sleeper Registry in each of the past five years, with a breakdown by the District Council district to which their street sleeping points belonged, gender, age, nationality and reason for street sleeping;

(2)of the top three districts in Hong Kong with the highest numbers of registered street sleepers in each of the past five years, as well as the respective percentages of such sleepers in the total number of registered street sleepers;

(3)in respect of emergency and short-term accommodation services for street sleepers (i) subvented by the Social Welfare Department (SWD) or (ii) operated on a self-financing basis by non-governmental organisations (NGOs), of the respective numbers of hostel places, the periods of stay, the ratios of hostel places for men and women and the average occupancy rates of hostel places in each of the past five years;

(4)of the number of persons waiting for hostel places for street sleepers in various districts, the waiting time and the number of successful cases of quitting street sleeping in each of the past five years; whether the SWD will consider regularly announcing the supply and demand situation of hostel places in various districts to reflect the actual service gaps; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(5) of the respective numbers of outreach visits provided, persons reached and referrals made by the three SWD-subvented Integrated Services Teams for Street Sleepers in each of the past five years, as well as the relevant subventions from the Government;

(6) of the number of street sleepers who were (i) assisted by the SWD to rent private tenement, (ii) referred by the SWD to apply for residential care services for the elderly, (iii) recommended by the SWD to the Housing Department and become eligible waitlisted cases for allocation of public rental housing units, as well as participating in other accommodation assistance programmes, in each of the past five years;

(7) whether the authorities have studied the underlying causes for the change in the total number of street sleepers in recent years, and what new measures are in place to help them improve their lives; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(8) whether the SWD will allocate additional resources or subsidies to government-subvented NGOs (including service units serving street sleepers) and NGOs operating on a self-financing basis to provide accommodation services for street sleepers, as well as increasing the manpower of social workers and psychiatric nurses and the funding of related items; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(9) as there are views that there is currently a severe shortage of hostel places for street sleepers, and that the maximum period of stay in SWD-subvented hostels is generally limited to six months, which fails to meet the needs of street sleepers for rehabilitation and reintegration into the community, whether the Government will consider increasing the number of places for transitional housing and extending the relevant period of stay to at least two years; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 Street sleeping is a complex social problem, involving the policies and work of different bureaux and departments, such as housing, welfare and health, as well as the co-ordination of interdepartmental operations at district level. Government departments and local service units concerned have been working in close collaboration to assist street sleepers.

 The reply to various parts of the question raised by the Reverend Canon the Hon Peter Douglas Koon is as follows:

(1) and (2)The Social Welfare Department (SWD)'s Computerised Street Sleepers Registry (Registry) consolidates information about street sleepers from SWD's and subvented casework units and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) dedicated to serving street sleepers. After social workers proactively engage with street sleepers through outreaching visits and service referrals, they would conduct professional assessment of the welfare needs of the street sleepers and input the relevant information into the Registry. Since 2023, the SWD has required service units to annually review all the registered cases of street sleepers in the Registry and timely update the data to enable closer service planning. The number of street sleepers reported by such service units in the past five years, broken down by district, gender, age group and reason for street sleeping are respectively set out in Table 1 to Table 4 in Annex. The top three District Council districts with the highest numbers of street sleepers and their respective percentages of total street sleepers in the past five years are set out in Table5. The Registry does not keep information on the nationality of street sleepers.

(3) to (9)The SWD has been subventing NGOs to operate three Integrated Services Teams for Street Sleepers (ISTs) to provide social welfare support services for street sleepers in Hong Kong. The ISTs proactively reach out to street sleepers through day and late night visits to understand their reasons for street sleeping, and render integrated services according to their actual needs and willingness to receive services. These services, including counselling, service referral, short-term accommodation and financial assistance, etc, are provided to address the urgent welfare needs of street sleepers, thereby helping them live off the streets and reintegrate into the community. The number of outreaching visits conducted by the ISTs, the number of street sleepers approached, the number of cases having given up street sleeping after receiving services by ISTs, and the expenditure on subvented integrated services for street sleepers in the past five years are set out in Table 6.

 The SWD also provides subvention to NGOs to operate short-term hostels for providing transitional accommodation for street sleepers, and through the provision of counselling and consultation services, assisting them to tide over to stable living arrangements. The number of places subvented by the SWD and provided by NGOs on a self-financing basis, broken down by gender, and the average occupancy rate of subvented places in the past five years are set out in Table 7 and Table 8 respectively. As street sleepers and the referring social workers may apply to the hostel directly for the service, the SWD does not maintain information on length of stay in hostels, the number of people on the waiting list and the waiting time in districts. The SWD does not maintain information on service referrals made by the ISTs, street sleepers renting private housing units, being recommended for allocation of public rental housing or participating in other accommodation assistance programmes either.

 Street sleepers have varied reasons for street sleeping, such as being unable to identify affordable accommodation due to unemployment or high rents, choosing to live on the street because of family relationship problems, being unable to secure stable accommodation after discharge from hospital, prison, or drug addiction treatment centre, financial instability, convenience for work and job seeking, lacking the will to live off the streets because of mental health or drug abuse problems, or a desire to stay in a familiar community for living, etc. When their related difficulties or accommodation problems are resolved, some street sleepers will choose to live off the street and reintegrate into the community, resulting in a decline in the number of street sleepers.

 To enhance the welfare support services for street sleepers, the SWD has allocated additional resources to subvented ISTs since 2020-‍21 to increase manpower of social workers, psychiatric nurses and drivers, as well as the funding of other relevant items. Moreover, additional short-term hostel places for street sleepers have been provided, increasing the number of subvented places to 228. The duration of stay at these hostels is normally up to six months, which may be extended by social workers, depending on the welfare needs of individual street sleepers to facilitate smooth implementation of suitable accommodation plans. The SWD will continue to keep in view the welfare service needs of street sleepers, while maintaining communication and collaboration with stakeholders and the government departments concerned, and provide appropriate welfare support services for street sleepers according to their needs, with a view to helping them restore living."

立法會二十一題：長者自住物業的差餉寬減措施,2026-01-21 11:10,2026-01-21 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012000582.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上植潔鈴議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見指出，長者在其擁有的物業單位自住時，即使無租金收入，仍須每季繳納差餉，加上日益增加的樓宇維修開支，甚為影響其居家安老的意欲及生活質素，因此過去一直有建議應寬減，甚或豁免長者自住物業的差餉。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據悉差餉物業估價署的資料庫並沒有備存差餉繳納人的年齡資料，以致政府未有掌握年滿65歲而沒有租金收入的自住業主人數，政府有否計劃整合現有的稅務、差餉及政府福利申領人士的數據，綜合推算該等長者自住業主的數目，以研究推出相關的差餉寬減措施；

（二）政府有否研究，運用公帑或提供津貼，協助有財政困難的自置物業獨居及雙老長者繳納差餉，甚或豁免有關差餉；如有，詳情為何；如否，會否考慮透過先導計劃試行有關措施；及

（三）鑑於過去的差餉寬減措施均是普惠性質，政府會否考慮引入以資格為本、針對長者自住物業的差餉減免機制，以更配合鼓勵居家安老的政策方向？

答覆：

主席：

差餉是就房產物業的應課差餉租值而徵收的稅項。物業的應課差餉租值是假設物業在指定的「估價依據日」（一般為每年的十月一日）空置出租時，估計可取得的全年市值租金。差餉物業估價署（估價署）每年會重估全港物業的應課差餉租值，作為釐定差餉的基礎。差餉繳納人須每季向估價署繳交差餉，差餉繳納人可以是業主、租客、佔用人或其代理人。估價署沒有備存物業的業主資料，亦不能以差餉繳納人的資料作有關推算。

差餉一直是政府的穩定收入之一，二○二四／二五年度的差餉收入約為327億元。政府每年在擬備《財政預算案》時，會因應社會各方面的意見、香港的經濟情況、公共財政負擔，以及社會各階層的需要，小心考慮是否推出一次性的差餉寬減措施。政府自一九九七／九八至二○二五／二六年度共推出24次差餉寬減，以減輕差餉繳納人的財政負擔。

政府在發放差餉寬減時，一直對所有差餉繳納人採取一視同仁的方針，以維持簡單易明及有效管理的差餉制度。如豁免長者業主自住物業繳交差餉，或就有關安排引入對相關差餉繳納人和自住物業的資格審查制度，不但會減少政府在差餉方面的收入，而且會令差餉寬減機制變得複雜，這包括長者業主需申報其單位符合自住物業的資格和適時更新其住宅物業的使用狀況，並備存相關資料及記錄以配合估價署的核實工作。估價署亦需審核有關申請、定期抽查獲批物業是否符合有關資格和跟進涉嫌不符合規定的個案，以減低寬減機制被濫用的風險。

政府的相關政策局／部門現時已有不同措施為有需要的長者提供支援。考慮到現有對長者的支援措施和為維持簡單易明及有效管理的差餉制度，政府未有計劃引入涉及資格審查的差餉寬減措施。"
LCQ21: Rates concession measures for self-occupied properties of elderly,2026-01-21 11:10,2026-01-21 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012000583.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Elaine Chik and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

 There are views pointing out that when residing in their own tenements, elderly persons are required to pay rates quarterly even without rental income. Coupled with increasing building maintenance expenses, this significantly affects their willingness to age in place and their quality of life. Therefore, there have been suggestions that rates concessions or even rates exemptions should be provided for self-occupied properties of the elderly. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is learnt that the Rating and Valuation Department's database does not maintain the age information of ratepayers, resulting in the Government lacking data on the number of owner-occupiers aged 65 ‍or above without rental income, whether the Government has plans to integrate existing data on taxes, rates and recipients of government welfare to make a comprehensive projection of the number of such elderly owner-occupiers, with a view to studying the introduction of relevant rates concession measures;

(2) whether the Government has studied the use of public funds or the provision of subsidies to assist elderly singletons and doubletons having financial difficulties who reside in self-owned properties in paying rates, or even the exemption of the relevant rates; if so, of the details; if not, whether it will consider implementing such measures under a pilot scheme; and

(3) given the inclusiveness of the rates concession measures in the past, whether the Government will consider introducing an eligibility-based rates concession mechanism specifically for self-occupied properties of the elderly, so as to better dovetail with the policy direction of encouraging ageing in place?

Reply:

President,

 Rates is a tax levied on properties based on their rateable values. Rateable value is the estimated annual rental value of a property as at the designated valuation reference date, generally October 1 of each year, assuming that the property was then vacant and to let. The Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) reviews the rateable values of all properties in Hong Kong annually as the basis for determining the rates payable. Rates are payable quarterly to the RVD by ratepayers, who may be the property owner, tenant, occupier, or their agent. RVD does not maintain records of property owners and cannot make relevant inferences based on the information of ratepayers.

 Rates has been one of the stable sources of government revenue. In 2024/25, the revenue from rates was around $32.7 billion. In the context of preparing for the Budget each year, the Government will carefully consider whether to grant one-off rates concessions, taking into account views from various sectors of society, the economic situation of Hong Kong, the burden on public finances and the needs of different sectors of the community. From 1997/98 to 2025/26, the Government has granted rates concessions on a total of 24 occasions to relieve the financial burden of ratepayers.

 In granting rates concessions, the Government has all along been adopting an across-the-board policy for all ratepayers in order to maintain a simple, transparent and effectively administered rating system. Exempting self-occupied properties of elderly owners from rates, or introducing in this regard a qualification system on relevant ratepayers and self-occupied properties, will not only reduce the government revenue from rates but also complicate the rates concession mechanism. This includes requiring elderly owners to declare that their units qualify as self-occupied properties and to update the occupation status of their domestic properties in a timely manner. The elderly owners will also be required to keep relevant information and records to facilitate verification by RVD. RVD will need to review the relevant applications, conduct regular spot checks on approved properties to ascertain if they meet the relevant eligibility criteria, and follow up on suspected non-compliance cases to reduce the risk of abuse of such concession mechanism.

 The relevant bureaux/departments of the Government already have various measures in place to provide support to elderly in need. Having considered the existing support measures to the elderly and the need to maintain a simple, transparent and effectively administered rating system, the Government has no plan to introduce rates concessions based on qualification."

問題：

根據政府數據，建造業及餐飲服務業的失業率高企，而且高於全港整體失業率。有市民反映，不同行業均有非法勞工（俗稱黑工）以低廉人工搶佔就業機會，更有企業濫用補充勞工優化計劃（優化計劃），嚴重打擊本地工人生計。有意見認為，為確保本地勞工優先就業，政府必須在輸入勞工的政策上嚴格把關，並須嚴厲打擊黑工。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府於去年九月針對優化計劃下輸入勞工較多的工種（包括侍應生及初級廚師）推出措施，以打擊濫用該計劃的行為，政府有否統計，有關行業及工種的外勞申請及獲批數目在該等措施推出前及後的變化為何；政府有否評估該等措施的成效；

（二）優化計劃推出以來，政府收到多少宗有關濫用該計劃的投訴，以及該等投訴所涉及的內容為何；政府調查該等投訴後，有多少名僱主被實施行政制裁，以及當中被禁止輸入外勞兩年的僱主數目為何；政府會否考慮就濫用優化計劃引入其他刑罰；

（三）按行業分項列出在過去三年，涉及非法勞工案件的被捕人數（包括勞工及僱主）及相關判罰，以及當中有多少宗案件涉及駕車載客；及

（四）鑑於《行政長官2025年施政報告》指出，政府正展開人力推算中期更新，針對輸入勞工比例較多的行業進行數據分析，有關工作的進展為何，以及有否制訂具體時間表，以能盡快根據分析結果檢視優化計劃？

答覆：

主席：

為應對人力短缺帶來的挑戰，政府在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，適度容許僱主確實未能在本地聘得合適人手時申請輸入勞工，推動香港的經濟發展。除為建造業、運輸業，以及安老院和殘疾人士院舍推出行業輸入勞工計劃外，勞工處自二○二三年九月四‍日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），暫停執行原有「補充勞工計劃」下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位一般不得輸入勞工的規定。政府一直密切監察就業市場的情況，並因應最新情況靈活及精準地調整優化計劃的實施安排，並大力打擊非法勞工，致力確保本地工人優先就業。

就議員的提問，經諮詢保安局後，現答覆如下：

（一）為確保本地工人優先就業及考慮個別行業職位勞動力的供求情況和變化，優化計劃於二○二五年九月十日實施本地招聘的新規定，要求申請輸入侍應生及初級廚師的僱主在進行本地招聘期間，必須每周參加一次勞工處指定就業中心舉行的招聘會，即場面見求職者。《行政長官2025年施政報告》並宣布，由二○二五年九月十八日起申請輸入侍應生及初級廚師時須進行的本地招聘，由四星期延長至六星期；並就上述兩個申請職位實行更嚴格的2比1人手比例規定，由以每名申請僱主的所有職位為基礎計算，改為以申請職位計算。換言之，僱主申請輸入侍應生及初級廚師各一名，便須已聘用本地全職侍應生及初級廚師各兩名。

九月開始實施上述新規定後，餐飲服務業的輸入勞工申請宗數明顯回落，由二○二五年六月至八月每月平均近370宗，下降至九月後每月平均約260宗。實行更嚴格的人手比例規定下，輸入侍應生及初級廚師的獲批比例及人數均見下降，獲批人數由二○二五年六月至八月每月平均分別近610人及560人，減少至每月平均約560人及310人。參加招聘會的新規定加強求職資訊的透明度，便利本地求職者在招聘會即時申請工作，有助促進本地勞動市場的就業配對，推動業界吸納合適的本地求職者。實施以申請職位計算人手比例的規定亦有效鼓勵僱主聘請本地工人擔任相關職位。

（二）勞工處自二○二三年九月四日推行優化計劃，截至二○二五年十二月三十一日，共接獲832宗有關優化計劃的投訴，主要涉及懷疑僱主以輸入勞工取代在職本地僱員、不符合人手比例規定或輸入勞工的工作安排等。同期，勞工處共向24名違反《僱員補償條例》、職業安全及健康法例、《入境條例》或優化計劃規定的僱主施加行政制裁，包括撤銷22名僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准和拒絕處理僱主隨後兩年提交的申請；以及中止處理兩名僱主已提交的申請及拒絕處理有關僱主在隨後一年提交的申請。

政府對各種違規行為絕不姑息。勞工處一直密切監察優化計劃的實施，適時檢視和完善計劃的運作和實行安排，確保僱主遵守優化計劃下的各項規定。

（三）政府一直致力打擊非法勞工，從而保障本地工人的就業機會。從事非法工作屬嚴重罪行，非法勞工、僱主，以及協助和教唆他人從事非法工作的人士均會根據《入境條例》被檢控。

根據入境事務處（入境處）的記錄，過去三年打擊非法勞工的執法行動（包括與警務處等部門進行聯合行動）次數，以及當中被拘捕的非法勞工和僱主人數表列如下：

被捕的非法勞工主要從事與餐飲或裝修行業有關的工作。過‍去三年被定罪的非法勞工大部分被判監，監禁刑期由六天至23個月不等；而被定罪的僱主大部分被判監或罰款，監禁刑期由28天至19個月不等，罰款金額則由1,000元至100,000‍元不等。入境處沒有備存提問涉及的其他分項統計數字。

至於涉及駕車載客的非法勞工，警務處於過去三年針對「白牌車」的執法行動中，共拘捕了11名非法勞工，並以「串謀詐騙」等罪名拘捕了11名涉嫌協助非法勞工透過網約車平台非法在港工作的人士。

保安局於二○二五年九月成立「跨部門反黑工專責組」（專責組），進一步加大打擊非法勞工的力度。專責組成員包括勞工及福利局（勞福局）、教育局、運輸及物流局、入境處、警務處、勞工處和運輸署。專責組會繼續密切留意非法勞工的情況，並適時制定整體應對策略，加大力度打擊非法勞工，以保障本地勞工就業。

（四）勞福局已開展人力推算的中期更新工作，將以二○二五年的最新情況為基準，更新對二○二八年整體人力供求的推算，相關結果預計於二○二六年第四季公布。為配合優化計劃於二○二六年上半年完成檢討，勞福局會針對輸入勞工比例較高的行業優先進行數據分析，以期提早提供有關部分的分析結果，在檢討優化計劃時作參考及幫助政府做好中長期規劃。"
LCQ12: Ensuring employment priority of local workers,2026-01-21 11:05,2026-01-21 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100210.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Tam Chun-kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

 According to government data, the unemployment rates in the construction sector and the food and beverage services sector remain high and exceed the Hong Kong's overall unemployment rate. Some members of the public have relayed that there are illegal workers snatching employment opportunities in various industries by asking for low wages, and some enterprises have even abused the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS), dealing a severe blow to the livelihood of local workers. There are views that in order to ensure employment priority of local workers, the Government must play a stringent gatekeeping role in its labour importation policy, and rigorously crack down on illegal workers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that in September last year, the Government launched measures targeting job categories with more imported workers under ESLS (including waiters/waitresses and junior cooks) to combat abuse of the scheme, whether the Government has compiled statistics on the changes in the numbers of applications for labour importation in respect of the relevant industries and job categories received and approved before and after the launch of such measures; whether the Government has assessed the effectiveness of such measures;

(2)of the number of complaints about abusing the ESLS received by the Government since its launch and the contents of such complaints; the number of employers subjected to administrative sanctions after the Government's investigations into such complaints and, among them, the number of employers prohibited from importing labour for two years; whether the Government will consider introducing other penalties for abuse of the ESLS;

(3) of the number of persons (including workers and employers) arrested and the relevant penalties imposed in cases involving illegal workers in the past three years, with breakdowns by industry, and among such cases, the number of those involving driving for the carriage of passengers; and

(4)as the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address has pointed out that the Government is undertaking a mid-term update of the Manpower Projection with focus on analysing data of industries with a larger number of imported labour, of the progress of the relevant work, and whether it has drawn up a specific timetable to enable an expeditious review of the ESLS on the basis of the outcome of the analysis?

Reply:

President,

 To cope with the challenges brought by manpower shortage and foster Hong Kong's economic development, the Government, on the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, suitably allows employers with genuine difficulty in recruiting suitable local workers to apply for importation of workers. Apart from launching sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction sector, transport sector, and residential care homes for the elderly and residential care homes for persons with disabilities, the Labour Department (LD) has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September4,2023, to suspend the general exclusion of the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts from labour importation under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme. The Government has been closely monitoring the employment market and adopting a flexible and targeted approach to adjust the implementation arrangements of the ESLS in light of the latest situation, while combating illegal workers rigorously to safeguard the employment priority for local workers.

 In consultation with the Security Bureau (SB), the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1)To ensure the employment priority for local workers and having regard to the situation and changes in the manpower supply and demand of individual industries and posts, the ESLS introduced new requirements of local recruitment on September 10, 2025, requiring employers applying to import waiters/waitresses and junior cooks to join a job fair held at a job centre specified by the LD once a week during the local recruitment period, and conduct job interviews on the spot. The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address also announced that from September 18,2025, when applying to import waiters/waitresses and junior cooks, the local recruitment period is extended from four weeks to six weeks, and a tightened manning ratio requirement of 2:1 is implemented for the above-mentioned two posts by changing the calculation basis from all posts of an applicant employer to each post under application. In other words, an employer applying to import a waiter/waitress and a junior cook must have already employed two local full-time waiters/ waitresses and two local full-time junior cooks.

 Since the implementation of the above new requirements in September, the number of applications for labour importation from the food and beverage services industry has dropped markedly from a monthly average of nearly 370 applications between June and August 2025 to about 260 applications after September. Upon the implementation of a more stringent manning ratio requirement, the approval rate and the number of imported waiters/waitresses and junior cooks approved have both declined. The number of approvals for these two posts decreased from monthly averages of nearly 610 and 560 respectively between June and August 2025 to about 560 and 310. The new requirement of attendance at job fairs has enhanced the transparency of vacancy information and made it easier for local job seekers to apply for jobs on the spot at job fairs, thereby facilitating employment matching in the local labour market and encouraging the industry to take on suitable local job seekers. The implementation of the post-based manning ratio requirement also effectively drives employers to employ local workers to take up relevant posts.

(2)Since the implementation of the ESLS on September 4, 2023, and as at December31,2025, the LD received a total of 832 complaints relating to the ESLS, mainly involving suspected displacement of serving local employees with imported workers, non-compliance with the manning ratio requirement or work arrangements of imported workers, etc. During the same period, the LD imposed administrative sanctions on 24employers who had violated the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, occupational safety and health legislation, Immigration Ordinance (IO) or requirements of the ESLS, including withdrawing the approvals for importing labour granted to 22 employers under the ESLS and refusing to process their subsequent applications for labour importation in the following two years, as well as refusing to process the applications submitted by two employers and their subsequent applications for labour importation in the following year.

 The Government does not condone any act of violation. The LD has been closely monitoring the implementation of the ESLS, reviewing and refining its operational and implementation arrangements in good time to ensure employers' compliance with various requirements under the ESLS.

(3)The Government is committed to combating illegal employment so as to safeguard the employment opportunities of local workers. It is a serious offence to engage in illegal employment. Illegal workers, employers, as well as aiders and abettors of illegal employment will be liable to prosecution in accordance with IO.

 According to the records of the Immigration Department (ImmD), the number of law enforcement operations against illegal workers (including joint operations with other departments including the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF)) in the past three years, as well as the number of illegal workers and employers arrested therein are tabulated below:




Year

2024
17 906
1 268

2025

 The arrested illegal workers were mainly engaged in work related to the catering or renovation industries. Over the past three years, the majority of the convicted illegal workers were sentenced to imprisonment with imprisonment terms ranging from six days to 23 months, whereas the majority of the convicted employers were sentenced to imprisonment or a fine, with imprisonment terms ranging from 28 days to 19 months, and fines ranging from $1,000 to $100,000. The ImmD does not maintain a breakdown of other statistics mentioned in the question.

 As regards illegal workers involved in driving for carriage of passengers, during the enforcement operations against illegal hire car services taken by the HKPF in the past three years, a total of 11 illegal workers were arrested, and 11 persons alleged to have assisted illegal workers to engage in illegal employment in Hong Kong through online car hailing platforms were arrested for offences such as conspiracy to defraud.

 The SB established in September 2025 an Inter-departmental Task Force against Illegal Employment (Task Force) to further step up efforts in combating illegal employment. The members of the Task Force include the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB), the Education Bureau, the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the ImmD, the HKPF, the LD and the Transport Department. The Task Force will continue to closely monitor the situation of illegal employment, formulate overall response strategies in a timely manner and step up efforts in combating illegal employment to safeguard the employment of local workers.

(4)The LWB has commenced the mid-term update of the Manpower Projection to update the projection of the overall manpower supply and demand for 2028 by using the most recent situation in 2025 as the baseline. Relevant results are expected to be announced in the fourth quarter of 2026. To tie in with the ESLS review which is to be completed in the first half of 2026, the LWB will accord priority to data analysis for industries with a higher proportion of imported labour, with a view to providing the relevant part of analytical results in advance for reference in reviewing the ESLS and supporting the Government's medium- to long-term planning."

他指出，香港作為國際金融中心，採取積極且穩慎的態度發展數字資產，並以「相同活動、相同風險、相同監管」的原則促進市場負責任及可持續發展。自二○二三年起，香港已向11家虛擬資產交易台發牌，並預計於今年稍後發出穩定幣牌照。此外，特區政府也以身作則推動代幣化的發展，包括發行了三批代幣化綠色債券，總額約21億美元；並推出監管沙盒以鼓勵應用創新。

其後，陳茂波分別與多位出席年會的經濟體和區域組織官員會面，包括泰國副總理兼財政部長Ekniti Nitithanprapas、海灣阿拉伯國家合作委員會秘書長賈西姆．布代維、埃及投資和外貿部長Hassan El Khatib、瑞士聯邦財政部國際金融事務國務秘書Daniela Stoffel等，就國際政經貿形勢和共同關心的議題交流看法，並討論加強雙方在經貿、金融、產業發展、數字轉型等方面的合作。

此外，陳茂波亦與世界貿易組織（世貿組織）總幹事伊維拉博士會面，雙方就國際貿易的形勢和前景交換看法。陳茂波在會面中指出，中國香港堅定支持自由貿易和多邊主義，並支持世貿組織因應當前面對的挑戰而進行改革，以更大的靈活性應對國際貿易中出現的新問題。

陳茂波昨日亦與科技投資機構Vista Equity Partners創始人、主席兼首席執行官Robert Smith會面，了解其最新的軟件數據業務發展，並鼓勵其擴充在港業務。

陳茂波今日（達沃斯時間一月二十一日）將繼續當地的訪問行程。"
"FS continues to attend World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland (with photos/video)",2026-01-21 09:00,2026-01-21 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100099.htm,"​The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, continued his programme at the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, yesterday (January 20, Davos time).

In the morning, Mr Chan attended the Special Address delivered by Vice Premier of the State Council Mr He Lifeng at the WEF Annual Meeting. Yesterday, he also held meetings with senior officials from various economies, representatives of international organisations and business leaders to brief them on Hong Kong's latest developments and unique advantages.

Mr Chan attended a breakfast meeting hosted by a digital asset company, Animoca Brands, where he engaged in discussions with leaders from the financial and innovation sectors on how blockchain applications — including tokenised assets and genomic data analytics — are driving transformation and development in capital markets.

Speaking at the meeting, Mr Chan said that finance and technology are mutually reinforcing. Financial innovations, such as digital assets, not only enhance transparency, efficiency, inclusiveness and risk management in financial services, but also facilitate more effective capital allocation to the real economy. He added that finance also plays a vital role in supporting and enabling technological development.

Mr Chan pointed out that, as an international financial centre, Hong Kong adopts a proactive yet prudent approach to the development of digital assets. The city follows the principle of ""same activity, same risk, same regulation"" to promote responsible and sustainable market development. Since 2023, Hong Kong has issued licences to 11 virtual asset trading platforms, and a licensing regime for stablecoins is expected to be launched later this year. He also highlighted the Government's leadership role in promoting tokenisation, including the issuance of three batches of tokenised green bonds amounting to around US$2.1 billion. In addition, regulatory sandboxes have been introduced to encourage innovative applications in the market.

Later in the day, Mr Chan met with a number of officials from different economies and regional organisations attending the WEF Annual Meeting, including Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance of Thailand, Mr Ekniti Nitithanprapas; the Secretary-General of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, Mr Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi; the Minister of Investment and Foreign Trade of Egypt, Mr Hassan El Khatib; and the State Secretary for International Finance at the Federal Department of Finance of Switzerland, Ms Daniela Stoffel. They exchanged views on the global political and economic landscape and issues of mutual concern, and explored opportunities to strengthen collaboration in areas such as trade, finance, industry development and digital transformation.

In addition, Mr Chan met with the Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, to exchange views on the current landscape and future of international trade. Mr Chan reiterated that Hong Kong, China firmly supports free trade and multilateralism, and expressed support for the WTO's efforts to pursue reforms in response to current global challenges, with a view to enhancing its agility in addressing emerging issues in international trade.

Mr Chan also met with the Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of technology investment firm Vista Equity Partners, Mr Robert Smith, to learn about the firm's latest developments in software and data businesses, and encouraged Mr Smith to consider expanding the company's presence in Hong Kong.

Mr Chan will continue his visit to Davos today (January 21, Davos time)."
天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-21 06:46,2026-01-21 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100111.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月二十一日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

有關更多健康資訊，可致電衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111），或參閱衞生防護中心網頁和Facebook專頁，以及勞工處於在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，對僱主及僱員發布應採取預防措施的新聞公報。

CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-21 06:46,2026-01-21 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100112.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 21) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

Vaccination and screening are both essential for preventing cervical cancer and can't be missed,2026-01-20 21:05,2026-01-20 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000780.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 20) reminded all female Hong Kong residents born between 2004 and 2008 who have not completed their human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to promptly receive free HPV vaccination at designated venues. Besides, women aged 25 to 64 who have had sexual experience should undergo regular cervical screenings. Through ""early prevention, early detection and early treatment"", they can reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer, which is one of the 10 most common cancers and a leading cause of cancer deaths among women in Hong Kong.

HPV vaccination
----------------------

""HPV vaccination is among the most effective measures for cervical cancer prevention, especially for females who have never been exposed to HPV infection, i.e. before their first sexual encounter. Since the 2019/20 school year, the DH has been providing free HPV vaccinations to eligible Primary schoolgirls under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme, and a high vaccination rate of over 90 per cent has been maintained in recent years. This significantly lowers the risk of cervical cancer in Hong Kong females,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui said.

The DH launched a one-off HPV Vaccination Catch-up Programme (Catch-up Programme) in December 2024, offering free catch-up vaccinations to female Hong Kong residents born between 2004 and 2008 who have not completed their HPV vaccination. Under the Catch-up Programme, each eligible person can receive two doses of free vaccination, while immunocompromised persons have to receive three doses of vaccination (all three doses are free of charge).

""The Catch-up Programme is implemented in three phases. With the support of secondary schools and post-secondary institutions, the estimated first-dose HPV vaccine coverage rates of eligible secondary schoolgirls and post-secondary institutions female students in the first two phases were 85 per cent and 68 per cent respectively (Note: These figures combine doses administered under the Catch-up Programme and self-arranged vaccinations). The final phrase of the Catch-up Programme has commenced in June last year, targeting female Hong Kong residents born between 2004 and 2008 who have completed their studies in Hong Kong. The estimated coverage is about 55 per cent within half a year. Overall, approximately 50 000 doses of vaccine have been administrated so far under the Catch-up Programme. Although the estimated overall coverage across all three phases has exceeded 60 per cent at present, I do not want 'anyone to be left behind'. The CHP has issued a letter to post-secondary institutions again to urge them to assist in encouraging eligible students to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Through the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHCC), the CHP has also urged family doctors to assist in encouraging eligible working female to receive HPV vaccination,"" Dr Tsui said.

Female Hong Kong residents born between 2004 and 2008 who have not completed their HPV vaccination only need to register with eHealth, and can schedule an appointment through thewebsiteor by calling 2855 1333 to receive a free HPV vaccination at Women Wellness Satellites (WWSs) or designated District Health Centres (DHCs)/DHC Expresses (DHCEs) under the PHCC of the Health Bureau. Females enrolled in local secondary schools or post-secondary institutions can contact their student affairs offices for details.

""The one-off Catch-up Programme lasting approximately for two years offers free HPV vaccination. Details can be found on the DH's website. Eligible female Hong Kong residents who do not participate in the Catch-up Programme will need to pay for vaccinations out-of-pocket in future. The cost of vaccination may exceed $1,200 per dose,"" Dr Tsui remarked.

Cervical screening
-----------------------

""Beyond vaccination, regular screening serves as another line of defence. Most cervical cancers are caused by persistent infection with high-risk HPV and infection with HPV or early stages of cervical cancer may not have any noticeable symptoms. In 2023, 576 new cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed, accounting for 3.0 per cent of all new cancer cases in females. Cervical cancer was the seventh most common cancer among females in Hong Kong. In 2024, a total of 160 women died from cervical cancer, accounting for 2.5 per cent of female cancer deaths. Over the past decade, the age-standardised mortality rate for cervical cancer has remained largely stable after adjusting for population age structure, reflecting the achievements of screening and treatment advancements. However, the age-standardised incidence rate of cervical cancer has shown a slight upward trend in recent years, indicating that the threat of cervical cancer to women's health should not be underestimated. Therefore, I urge women aged 25 to 64 who have had sexual experience to undergo regular cervical screening in order to promptly detect and treat early cervical pre-cancerous changes, thereby preventing cervical cancer and improving cure rates,"" Dr Tsui said.

The DH has implemented the Cervical Screening Programme since 2004. Cervical screening services are available at Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) of the DH, WWSs, as well as through non-governmental organisations and private healthcare providers. Common screening methods include HPV testing and/or a cytology examination (also called a cervical smear or pap smear) performed by healthcare professionals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also recommended vaginal self-sampling for HPV testing as another reliable method for cervical screening. The latest Health Behaviour Survey of the DH revealed that about 50 per cent of eligible women had ever had cervical screening. The DH has been working closely with healthcare professionals to enhance the promotion of cervical screening through general education and clinical consultation, and to understand the barriers of the public to accept the screening. To echo WHO's advice, starting in 2024, the DH initiated HPV testing of self-collected samples at 11 MCHCs to study the feasibility and acceptability of vaginal HPV self-sampling locally. Moreover, HPV testing of self-collected samples is planned to be rolled out in WWSs in the first quarter of 2026. Details will be announced later on the WWS'swebsite.

It is important to note that there is currently insufficient scientific evidence in Hong Kong or internationally to support the use of self-collected menstrual blood or urine samples for cervical screenings. The DH will continue to review the latest scientific evidence.

Women who wish to receive a cervical screening at MCHCs can schedule an appointment through the 24-hour hotline at 3166 6631, or contact WWSs via itswebsiteor 18 DHCs/DHCEs (website) for personalised primary healthcare services for women including cervical cancer screening. For further information on cervical cancer and screenings, please visit the DH'swebsite."
CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as three severe paediatric influenza infection cases have been reported within eight days,2026-01-20 19:34,2026-01-20 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000752.htm,"​The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 20) recorded a severe paediatric influenza infection case, marking the third such case within eight days. Based on historical epidemiological data, Hong Kong usually enters its winter influenza season in January. It cannot be ruled out that influenza activity may rise again in the coming months. The CHP reiterated its reminder to parents to arrange for their children to receive a free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly. The SIV remains one of the most effective methods of preventing influenza and its complications and can reduce the risk of serious complications or death from infection.

The case involves a 14-year-old girl. On January 18, she attended a private clinic as she developed a fever, runny nose, sore throat, cough and myalgia. She further presented with dizziness on the following day (January 19) and sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of United Christian Hospital. Due to persistently low blood pressure, she was admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital for treatment. Her respiratory specimen tested positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. She remains hospitalised, but her condition hasstabilised and her blood pressure has returned to normal.

A preliminary investigation revealed that the girl had received the 2025/26 SIV. Three of her classmates recently developed influenza-like symptoms. One of them was hospitalised and has been discharged, with a respiratory specimen testing positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The other two students presented with mild symptoms and did not require hospitalisation. The CHP advised the school concerned on the necessary infection control measures to be implemented and will continue to put the school under medical surveillance. The 14-year-old girl has four household contacts. Two of them developed mild respiratory symptoms earlier but did not require hospitalisation.

So far this year, three severe paediatric influenza cases have been recorded, involving children aged between 6 months and 14 years old. Two of the affected children had not received SIV, including one case who received the 2025/26 SIV only three days before the onset of illness. As the patient was not protected by the vaccine, the case is not counted as being vaccinated. During the summer influenza season ending in early January, 25 severe paediatric influenza cases were recorded, including three fatal cases and involving children aged between 6 months to 17 years old. Among them, 20 cases (80 per cent) had not received an SIV (including one case who received the 2025/26 SIV only four days before the onset of illness).

""Influenza activity may rise again as the weather remains cold in the first quarter of this year, and it cannot be ruled out that the circulating virus strains may change as the winter influenza season approaches. Therefore, I once again urge all individuals aged 6 months or older, except those with known contraindications, to act promptly if they have not yet received an SIV. This includes those who contracted influenza during the summer influenza season in order to guard against other circulating virus strains that may emerge during the upcoming winter influenza season. Furthermore, although there are some antigenic differences between the currently circulating influenza A (H3) virus strain and the virus strain contained in the vaccine, scientific research indicates that this season's influenza vaccines can still offer protection against the variant strain of subclade K, as well as the influenza A (H1) and influenza B strains included in the vaccine,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""The number of influenza outbreaks in schools has increased since classes resumed after the holidays. For children who did not join the SIV School Outreach Programme, parents should promptly bring their children toprivate doctorsenrolled in the Vaccination Subsidy Scheme to receive an SIV. In addition, the SIV coverage rate for children aged 6 months to under 2 years is only about 23 per cent. Although this represents an approximate 4 percentage point increase compared to the same period last year, it is still much lower than that of other age groups. Through the Primary Healthcare Commission, the CHP has urged family doctors to assist in encouraging parents to allow their children to receive an SIV,"" Dr Tsui added.

He also reminded members of the public that, especially for children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, they should seek medical advice promptly for early treatment if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."
預防子宮頸癌　疫苗和篩查一個不能少,2026-01-20 19:27,2026-01-20 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000731.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月二十日）提醒所有在二○○四年至二○○八年出生而未完成接種人類乳頭瘤病毒（HPV）疫苗的女性香港居民盡快到指定地點免費接種疫苗。另外，25至64歲曾有性經驗的婦女亦應定期進行子宮頸篩查，透過「早預防、早發現、早治療」，遠離本港女性十大常見及致命癌症——子宮頸癌的威脅。

HPV疫苗
————

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「接種HPV疫苗是預防子宮頸癌最有效的措施之一，尤其在婦女未感染病毒前（即未有性行為前），疫苗能發揮最佳效能。自二○一九／二○學年起，衞生署在香港兒童免疫接種計劃下，為合資格的小學女童免費接種HPV疫苗，過去幾年一直維持超過九成的極高接種率，大大減低香港女性患上子宮頸癌的機會。」

衞生署於二○二四年十二月開展一次性HPV疫苗補種計劃（補種計劃），為二○○四年至二○○八年出生、尚未完成接種HPV疫苗的女性香港居民提供免費補種。補種計劃下，每名合資格人士可免費接種兩劑疫苗，而免疫力弱的人士則需接種三劑（三劑均為免費）。

徐樂堅醫生說：「補種計劃分三個階段推行，首兩個階段在各中學及專上院校的支持下，合資格的全日制中學女生及專上院校女生的第一劑HPV疫苗覆蓋率分別估算為85%和68%（註：綜合計算參與補種計劃和已經自行安排接種的人士）。補種計劃最後階段已經於去年六月展開，對象為二○○四年至二○○八年出生而已經完成本地學業的女性香港居民，半年間的疫苗覆蓋率初步估算已達55%。整體而言，補種計劃至今已接種約五萬劑疫苗，雖然三個階段的估算整體覆蓋率暫時已超過六成，但我不希望『任何人掉隊』。中心已再次去信各專上院校，促請他們協助鼓勵合資格學生盡快接種疫苗。中心亦已透過基層醫療署呼籲家庭醫生，協助鼓勵合資格在職婦女接種HPV疫苗。」

二○○四年至二○○八年出生的女性香港居民若未完成接種HPV疫苗只需先登記「醫健通」，便可透過網頁或致電2855 1333預約於醫務衞生局基層醫療署轄下的樂妍站或指定地區康健中心／站免費接種HPV疫苗；就讀本港中學或專上院校之女生則可向校內事務處查詢。

徐樂堅醫生強調：「補種計劃屬一次性特別安排，為期約兩年，費用全免，詳情可瀏覽衞生署網頁。不參與補種計劃的合資格女性香港居民日後需要自費接種，疫苗接種費用每劑可能超過1,200元。」

子宮頸篩查
—————

徐樂堅醫生說：「除了疫苗，定期篩查防治是另一重防線。大部分子宮頸癌由持續感染高風險的HPV引致，HPV感染或早期子宮頸癌可能沒有任何明顯症狀，在二○二三年，共有576宗新確診子宮頸癌病例，佔女性癌症新症總數的3.0%，在女性癌症中排第七位。而在二○二四年，共有160名女性死於子宮頸癌，佔女性癌症死亡人數的2.5%。在過去10年，剔除人口年齡結構因素後，子宮頸癌的年齡標準化死亡率大致平穩，反映篩查與治療進展的成果。然而子宮頸癌的年齡標準化發病率近年呈現輕微上升趨勢，顯示子宮頸癌對女性健康的威脅不容輕視。因此，我提醒25至64歲曾有性經驗的婦女應定期進行子宮頸篩查，及早發現和治療早期的子宮頸細胞癌前病變，以預防子宮頸癌及提升治癒率。」

衞生署自二○○四年起推行子宮頸普查計劃。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、樂妍站、非政府機構及私營醫護服務提供者都有提供子宮頸篩查服務。常見的子宮頸篩查方法包括以醫護人員採集的子宮頸樣本進行HPV檢測及／或子宮頸細胞檢驗（又稱子宮頸抹片或柏氏抹片）。世界衞生組織（世衞）亦建議透過自行採集陰道樣本進行HPV檢測為子宮頸篩查的另一可靠方法。衞生署最新的健康行為調查結果顯示，約50%合資格婦女曾進行子宮頸篩查。衞生署一直與醫護人員緊密合作，透過教育及臨床診治，加強推廣子宮頸篩查，並了解市民在接受篩查方面遇到的障礙。為響應世衞呼籲，自二○二四年起，11間母嬰健康院進行HPV自行採樣檢測先導計劃及研究，探討陰道HPV自行採樣的可行性和接受程度。此外，樂妍站計劃在二○二六年第一季推出HPV自行採樣檢測計劃，詳情將稍後於樂妍站網頁公布。

值得留意的是，本港乃至國際間目前尚未有充分科學證據支持使用自行採集經血或尿液樣本作子宮頸篩查。衞生署會持續檢視最新科學實證。

婦女如計劃在母嬰健康院進行子宮頸篩查，可透過24小時熱線3166 6631預約，或聯絡樂妍站（網頁）或十八區地區康健中心／站（網頁）預約包括子宮頸癌篩查在內的個人化女性基層醫療服務。更多有關子宮頸癌和篩查的資訊，請瀏覽衞生署網頁。"
八日內第三宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2026-01-20 18:40,2026-01-20 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000684.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月二十日）接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案，是八日內第三宗。根據以往流行病學資料，香港多在一月踏入冬季流感季節，不排除流感活躍程度在未來數月會再度上升。中心再次提醒家長應盡快安排子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗。接種流感疫苗仍然是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名14歲女童。她於一月十八日出現發燒、流涕、咽喉痛、咳嗽和肌肉痛，同日到私家診所求診，翌日（一月十九日）出現頭暈，並到基督教聯合醫院急症室求醫，由於病人血壓持續偏低，遂被安排入住深切治療部接受治療。她的呼吸道樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應。她目前仍然留院，情況已轉趨穩定，而血壓已回復正常。

初步調查顯示，該女童已接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗，她的三名同班同學近日出現流感樣病徵，其中一人曾入院並已出院，其呼吸道樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，另外二人病況輕微，無需入院。中心已建議校方實施感染控制措施，並會對該校進行醫學監察。她有四名家居接觸者，其中兩人早前均出現輕微呼吸道感染症狀，無需住院。

今年至今已錄得三宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎六個月至14歲，其中兩宗沒有接種季節性流感疫苗（包括一宗個案在發病前三天才接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗，由於患者未能受到疫苗保護，因此個案被視為未接種疫苗）。而在一月初結束的夏季流感季節，共錄得25宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括三宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎六個月至17歲。當中，20宗（80%）個案沒有接種季節性流感疫苗（包括一宗個案在發病前四天才接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗）。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「隨着天氣在今年首季維持寒冷，而流行病毒株亦不排除會發生改變，流感活躍程度可能會再度上升，冬季流感季節即將到臨。因此，我再次呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗，應從速行動，包括在夏季流感季節曾感染流感的人士，以預防未來的冬季流感季節可能出現其他流行病毒株。此外，雖然目前流行的甲型（H3）流感病毒與疫苗所含的病毒株存在一些抗原差異，但科學研究顯示本季使用的季節性流感疫苗仍能對亞分支K的變異病毒株，以及疫苗中包含的甲型（H1）及乙型流感病毒提供保護。」

徐樂堅醫生補充：「學校的流感爆發在假期復課後有所增加。如果學童沒有參加季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃，家長應盡快帶子女到參加疫苗資助計劃的私家醫生接種季節性流感疫苗。此外，六個月至未滿兩歲的幼兒的季節性流感疫苗接種率只有約23%，雖然較上一季度同期上升約四個百分點，但仍遠低於其他年齡組別的接種率。中心已經透過基層醫療署呼籲家庭醫生，協助鼓勵家長讓子女接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

Man sentenced to six months' imprisonment for illegally importing alternative smoking products,2026-01-20 18:15,2026-01-20 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000664.htm,"A man was sentenced today (January 20) at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts to six months' imprisonment for illegally importing 40 000 alternative smoking products. The Department of Health (DH) welcomed the verdict, stating that imprisonment serves as a significant deterrent. The DH also reminded members of the public and visitors not to bring alternative smoking products such as e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products or herbal cigarettes into Hong Kong, and not to use any alternative smoking products.

The Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the DH was notified by Hong Kong Customs yesterday (January 19) that 40 000 alternative smoking products were intercepted in the luggage of the aforesaid man arriving from Guangzhou. TACO immediately arrested and prosecuted the individual.

Since the amendments to theTobacco Control Legislation (Amendment) Ordinance 2025, which conferred arrest powers on TACO inspectors,took effect on September 19, 2025, TACO has prosecuted 15 cases involving importation of large quantities of alternative smoking products. Seventeen persons have been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment ranging from two to six months.

According to the Import and Export Ordinance (Cap. 60), a person who imports alternative smoking products, including electronic smoking products, heated tobacco products and herbal cigarettes, commits an offence and isliable on summary conviction to a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for two years; or liable on conviction on indictment to a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Moreover, under the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Cap. 371), no person may promote, manufacture, sell, or possess for commercial purposes alternative smoking products. An offender is liable to a fine of $50,000 and imprisonment for six months.

  TACO will continue to closely monitor and enforce the law to combat related offences.

The DH also cautions the public that alternative smoking products are addictive and are not effective smoking cessation tools. E-cigarettes may increase the risk of cancer, respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Smokers are urged to quit smoking as early as possible for their own health and that of others. For assistance, please call the DH's Integrated Smoking Cessation Hotline on 1833 183, and or visit www.livetobaccofree.hk for information on quitting."

衞生署控煙酒辦公室（控煙酒辦）昨日（一月十九日）接獲香港海關通知，於該名自廣州抵港男子的行李中搜獲四萬支另類吸煙產品。控煙酒辦隨即拘捕及檢控該名人士。

自《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例》中有關控煙酒辦督察拘捕權的修訂於二○二五年九月十九日生效以來，控煙酒辦已就15宗攜帶大量另類吸煙產品入境的案件提出檢控，共有17人被定罪和被判處監禁，刑期由兩個月至六個月不等。

根據《進出口條例》（第60章），任何人進口另類吸煙產品，包括電子煙、加熱煙產品及草本煙，即屬違法，經簡易程序定罪，可判處罰款50萬及監禁兩年；而經公訴程序定罪，則可判處罰款200萬元及監禁七年。

此外，根據《吸煙（公眾衞生）條例》（第371章），任何人不得推廣、製造、售賣或為商業目的而管有另類吸煙產品。違例者一經定罪，最高可處罰款五萬元及監禁六個月。

控煙酒辦會繼續密切監察和持續執法以打擊相關違法行為。

此外，衞生署忠告市民，另類吸煙產品會令人上癮，絕非有效的戒煙工具。電子煙亦可增加患上癌症、呼吸系統疾病、心血管疾病之風險。吸煙人士為個人及他人健康着想，應盡快戒煙。市民可致電衞生署綜合戒煙熱線1833 183，或瀏覽www.livetobaccofree.hk，以獲取有關戒煙的資訊。"

Semi-urgent and non-urgent cases drop significantly by 20 per cent; Accident and Emergency Departments focus resources on critical and emergency care,2026-01-20 17:42,2026-01-20 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026011900629.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

  The Hospital Authority (HA) spokesperson announced today (January 20) that since the implementation of the public healthcare fees and charges reform, there has been an overall decrease in the number of attendances at Accident and Emergency Departments (A&Es) of public hospitals, with a significant drop in semi-urgent and non-urgent cases. The average waiting time for urgent patients to receive treatment has also decreased, indicating that resources are more effectively focused on critical and emergency care, resulting in improved efficiency in treating emergency patients.

  From January 1 to 18, 85 676 patients attended the 18 A&Es under the HA, representing a significant decrease of nearly 15 per cent compared to the same period last year. Among the cases, 4 889 patients were triaged as critical and emergency cases, showing an increase of 7.7 per cent compared to the same period last year. Thirty-eight thousand one hundred fifty-five patients were classified as urgent cases, representing a decrease of 8.4 per cent year on year. The remaining 42 632 patients were classified as semi-urgent and non-urgent cases, marking a substantial decrease of 21.3 per cent compared to the same period last year. The latest A&E statistics are analysed as follows:


Significant decrease in average daily A&E attendances by 14.6 per cent;
About 4 900 critical and emergency patients exempted from A&E fees under the new fees and charges reform. These patients were required to pay the fees before the reform;
For patients classified as urgent cases, the percentage of those being treated within 30 minutes - meeting the service pledge target - increased from 82.7 per centlast year to 87.1 per cent, with the average waiting time reduced from 22 to 20 minutes;
Among the five triage categories, the proportion of semi-urgent and non-urgent patients decreased from 54.2 per centlast year to 49.8 per cent; and
The average waiting time for semi-urgent and non-urgent patients decreased from 144 minutes last year to 111 minutes.


The Chairman of the HA Coordinating Committee in A&E, Dr Axel Siu,said, ""The latest statistics of A&Es, including attendance numbers, semi-urgent and non-urgent cases, and treatment efficiency for urgent patients, all indicate that resources of A&Es are now better directed towards critical and emergency patients. Non-urgent patients or patients with other medical needs are changingto seek more appropriate healthcare services other than A&Es, achieving the original intention of the public healthcare fees and charges reform. A&Es can better concentrate resources and treat patients with urgent medical needs more effectively. We are very pleased to see that the reform has successfully achieved its positive and intended outcomes.""

Dr Siu reiterated that A&E is positioned to serve critical, emergency and urgent patients. Individuals with minor conditions or episodic illnesses, such as common colds, are encouraged to visit Family Medicine Clinics, private doctors, or 24-hour outpatient services of private hospitals. Following the implementation of the public healthcare fees and charges reform, the HA has regularised the A&E refund arrangements, which can facilitate less urgent patients in opting to other healthcare institutions after triage. From January 1 to 18 this year, a total of 952 A&E patients applied for refund.

The HA will continue to closely monitor the operations of A&E to ensure that resources are focused on patients with urgent medical needs, in line with the objectives of the public healthcare fees and charges reform to strengthen support for ""poor, acute, serious, critical"" patients."

醫院管理局（醫管局）發言人今日（一月二十日）表示，公營醫療收費改革實施以來，公立醫院急症室整體求診人次有所減少，次緊急及非緊急病人數目下跌顯著。而緊急病人接受治療的平均等候時間亦有所下降，反映資源更集中於救急扶危，急症病人救治效率提升。

今年一月一日至十八日，共有85 676名病人前往醫管局轄下18間急症室就診，較去年同期顯著減少近一成半，其中4 889名病人分流類別為危殆及危急，較去年同期上升7.7%；38 155名病人分流為緊急，較去年同期下跌8.4%，次緊急及非緊急則為42 632人，較去年同期大減超過兩成達21.3%。急症室最新數據分析如下︰


急症室每日平均求診人次顯著減少14.6%；
約4 900名分流類別為危殆及危急的病人在新收費機制下獲豁免急症室收費。而在收費改革前，此類病人需要繳費；
分流類別為緊急的病人於30分鐘內就診，達致服務承諾指標的比率由去年82.7%增加至87.1%，而平均等候時間亦由22分鐘縮短至20分鐘；
五類分流類別中，次緊急及非緊急病人佔比由去年54.2%減少至49.8%；及
次緊急及非緊急病人平均等候時間由去年144分鐘減少至111分鐘。


醫管局急症科統籌委員會主席蕭粵中醫生表示︰「急症室的最新數據，包括求診人數、次緊急及非緊急病人數目，以及緊急病人診治效率，均反映急症室的資源更能導向於處理危急病人，非緊急或有其他醫療需要的病人亦會尋求急症室以外更合適的醫療服務，達致公營醫療收費改革的初衷，將資源集中及有效治療有緊急醫療需要的病人，我們十分樂見改革成功達到正面及預期的效果。」

蕭粵中醫生重申，急症室的定位在於服務危殆、危急及緊急病人，病情較輕或患上偶發性疾病，例如普通傷風感冒，相關人士應該盡量前往家庭醫學診所、私家醫生或私家醫院24小時門診就診。醫管局在公營醫療收費改革實施後，將急症室退款機制恆常化，亦有助非緊急病人在分流後選擇轉往其他醫療機構就診。今年一月一日至十八日，共有952名急症室病人申請退款。

醫管局會繼續密切監察急症室的運作情況，確保急症室集中資源照顧有緊急醫療需要的病人，以達致公營醫療收費改革中，加強保障貧、急、重、危病人的宗旨。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-20 17:30,2026-01-20 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000616.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 20), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-20 17:30,2026-01-20 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000602.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月二十日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。
​
市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
SFST and SCS speak on report of Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime and outcome of relevant disciplinary investigation (with video),2026-01-20 17:22,2026-01-20 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000638.htm,"Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, and the Secretary for the Civil Service, Mrs Ingrid Yeung, at a media session on the report of the Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime and outcome of the disciplinary investigation of the procurement of bottled drinking water incident this morning (January 20):

Reporter:Why did the accountability buck stop at the Government Logistics Department? Why is the Government satisfied that there was no further oversight from bureau level? And what mechanism besides the preliminary suggestions raised before by the Government imposed to prevent similar oversight from happening again?

Secretary for the Civil Service: Our investigation has been thorough and has been comprehensive, and it has revealed a lot of facts. Our decisions are all made based on the facts. Our decisions in conducting disciplinary actions against certain officers, in reflecting their performances in their performance appraisals and so on, have to be commensurate with the shortcomings revealed in the investigation report. So, everything is based on facts and we'll seek to take actions that are commensurate with the responsibilities of the officers concerned.

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury: In response to your question about what we have done to improve the regulatory regime, or the overall regime of the Government in procurement, I think it is exactly the purpose that we have set out to do when I led the Task Force to look at: what are the areas that we can do further? Along those lines, we have already identified four areas, including in terms of the mechanism to deal with the assessment and the contract management of tendering; and to look into the technology to make sure that there will be a wider circulation of information within the Government in case of any issues that we want to highlight to other procuring departments. At the same time, a lot of these measures have been implemented. For example, in the current re-tendering of our bottled water exercise, we have already implemented those measures. So, in conclusion, I would say that we have already identified the issues, and we have put them into practice and will continue to do so.

Reporter: First, I would like to see if Mrs Yeung could explain a bit more, in terms of why did the Government decide to revoke the former Government Logistics Department head Mr Carlson Chan's honours, and how appropriate or sufficient do you think it is to reflect the severity of the case?

Secretary for the Civil Service: I think this procurement of drinking water incident has drawn extensive attention from the public and brought serious disrepute to the Government. In this light, after consulting the Honours and Non-official Justices of the Peace Selection Committee, the Government has decided to reverse the previously announced decision to award the Silver Bauhinia Star to Mr Chan, and Mr Chan has been informed. This is after consideration of the investigation result and all the facts revealed.

財庫局局長及公務員事務局局長就檢討政府採購機制專責小組報告和相關紀律調查結果會見傳媒談話內容（附短片）,2026-01-20 17:22,2026-01-20 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000637.htm,"​以下為財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）局長許正宇及公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵今日（一月二十日）就檢討政府採購機制專責小組報告和就採購樽裝飲用水事件進行的紀律調查結果會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：想問陳嘉信，既然其他政府物流服務署（物流署）官員會被停止發放增薪點，為何他退休後不會有削弱其退休金這些懲處方式，而只是撤回他的勳章﹖第二，中央投標委員會主席黎志華，以及代政府簽標書、已經退休的採購總監曾昭奇，這些官員會否都問責？

公務員事務局局長：首先，我想解釋一下，我們是根據調查組得出來的事實去判定不同的同事要負的責任。我們說問責不是憑空講，第一要基於事實，第二都要合度，即是合乎事實反映出來該事件的比例。我們剛才都解釋了，調查組發現有三位物流署人員未能夠及時去識別一些好明顯的不妥之處、一些詐騙的跡象，令部門錯過及時去反應的時機。前署長是因為同事沒有上報，所以他在事件上是沒有辦法知道有這些跡象出現，因此調查組沒有發現前署長有疏忽的地方。但因為同事的能力有所欠缺，以及見到有一個普遍性，對於署長工作的這個範疇——提升同事工作能力這方面，我們覺得是有不足，因此去信給他。另外，授勳及非官守太平紳士遴選委員會亦考慮了所有事實，作出了這個建議。

至於其他同事，對於物流署三位同事是哪三位，我就不會在此透露他們的身分，我亦不會回應任何關於他們身分的猜測，因為我們對於同事，在處理他們的紀律處分等，都要顧及他們的私隱。至於在物流署以外，調查組沒有發現其他公務員有疏忽的情況。

記者：首先想弄清楚，剛才局長提到幾位前物流署人員，這一刻他們會繼續在部門工作還是已經離開物流署？他們在調查期間的工作狀態是怎樣？如果確認他們表現極度不理想，特別是那位首長級人員，之後會否再有其他懲處？第二，有報道指今次調查報告（完成）之後曾經諮詢過DOJ（律政司），有否諮詢過DOJ？當中有否涉及刑事成分而有研究過可能要追討﹖

公務員事務局局長：我剛才提到的是前物流署署長，該幾位人員並不是前物流署同事，他們都是物流署的同事。他們在調查期間都需要工作，有一些正在放假就在放假（不是因為調查而放假），有一些工作的就繼續工作。我剛才提到我們會就三位人員的其中兩位進行正式的紀律行動，會是一個獨立的研訊，對於政府就他們的指控會有一個結果。我們會根據結果決定如何懲處，這是一般正式紀律行動的過程。

我們諮詢律政司就是因為要做正式的紀律行動。我們在每一個正式的紀律行動個案，指控都需要比較精準，不可以籠統地說，所以就每一個個案，若要做正式的紀律行動，我們都會諮詢律政司。這次諮詢律政司都是同一個原因。

記者：三位人員在採購程序中分別扮演甚麼角色？今次發現署方問題有普遍性，其實問題的普遍性即是怎樣﹖即是採購程序不小心或者未能夠識破虛假文書的情況都有出現，其他程序是否都有這個情況，大眾是否需要擔心？

財經事務及庫務局局長：正如剛才楊局長所說，今次調查揭示了一個比較核心的內容，就是發現同事在一些關鍵時點，針對一些關鍵事實，沒有很及時地上報。由此得出的結論是，某程度上，同事作為採購把關者，相關的經驗和標準是未能達到，因而才有楊太（公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵）剛才所說的相應安排。

公務員事務局局長：普遍性不是說有很多應該能識別出來的不妥之處卻識別不到，而是同事在這件事上的表現欠缺警覺性、欠缺判斷力和欠缺分析能力。因為不同職級的同事都有這樣的表現，我們覺得在部門內，這不是個別人士的問題，而是顯示有一個普遍性。

記者：其實今次事件只是三位人員已經導致到大部分政府部門使用不是合法來源的樽裝水，會否認為之後類似事件應該由多些人負責，可不可以只是歸咎於不小心？是不是制度上都有一些漏洞？剛才只是提及四個方向，具體上應該怎樣改善？

公務員事務局局長：我首先回答部分問題。在整個事件中，我重申調查組是非常深入、非常全面地找出所有相關事實，然後我們根據這些事實，對不同人應該要負的責任作了一個判斷。最後，我們發現需要負責的或者有疏漏、有疏忽的就是三位同事，我看不到為甚麼需要牽涉多些人，因為需要負責的同事就需要負責，而在整個過程中，這些同事不是因為有太多工作以致未能顧及。所以，日後要負責做這些工作的都是同樣人數，同樣職級的同事，不過他們在警覺性、分析能力和判斷力方面要有所進步。

財經事務及庫務局局長：你剛才提到的制度問題正是我領導的制度檢討小組（檢討政府採購機制專責小組）的主要內容和目標。我們現在做的一系列優化措施，包括我在十月時說過的，現在已經落實了絕大部分。我們希望做到全流程，進行招標評估前，在合約管理和事後處理方面，都能夠提升我們採購的能力。牽涉採購貨品的安排，我們是貨到才付款的。所以我們對一些可能滿足不到財務要求的供應商，我們只要求他們繳交更高的保證金——百分之五或六，仍然是接受他們（入標）的。但我們現在很清晰，若是超過1,500萬元的貨品合約，我們同樣要求做財務審查，這是第一。第二方面是聚焦樽裝水的安排，我們過去是容許貿易公司入標的，但今次（招標）很清楚，必須是飲用水製造商，我們才容許（它入標）。由於水本身是一個比較簡單、明瞭、清晰的產品，我們沒有必要一個中介或者貿易商做相關的招標工作。

記者﹕報告顯示時任物流署署長沒有疏忽，因為下級沒有上報，其實超過5,000萬元（的採購）都無需部門首長知道，其實要怎樣才可以向首長呈報知道﹖另外，物流署人員在事件中的表現都未達到與其職級和經驗相稱的水平，反映有普遍性，作為署長都看不到這個普遍性其實是否失職，剛剛說他其實沒有疏忽，但為何又要撤回他的銀紫荊星章？

公務員事務局局長：首先，我想解釋在調查過程中有就署長對部門管理、對部門發生的事的掌握等制度有進行調查，發現部門內存在足夠的監管、匯報等制度。我們在調查過程中亦詢問了前署長下級的同事，他們亦表達署長是非常歡迎同事向他匯報任何事情。機制存在，亦不是不讓同事匯報，但無奈是同事根本識別不到該事件是應該需要匯報，即是說機制雖然存在，署長歡迎同事匯報，但同事識別不到該事件是需要匯報而沒有向上級報告。所以這件事的核心，是同事缺乏與他們的職級和經驗應有的警覺、判斷力和分析能力，這才是關鍵，並非沒有這些制度存在，或者署長不接受同事的匯報等。

談到署長有沒有責任，我剛才已解釋，在部門中有幾個不同職級的同事都顯示在這些工作能力方面有欠缺，看到一個普遍性，所以署長在任時於部門辨識同事的強弱項，以及針對他們的弱項多做培訓、多做輔導，應該更加有作為，這部分是可以做得更加多，所以我們發信給他。一般來說，同事在工作某方面，若我們覺得有些欠缺、應該有進步，我們都會這樣做。

第二是你提到的撤回勳章，撤回勳章本身不是一個罰則，勳章制度本身是一個嘉獎的制度，今次是撤回予他的一個獎勵，不是一個懲罰，我希望大家分清楚兩個方面。

記者：前署長陳嘉信先生有否就相關的裁定結果向當局有甚麼解釋，或者提出申訴？

公務員事務局局長：我們對於任何同事，如果向他表達了一些看法，他可以向我們作申述，我們亦會聆聽他的申述。如果有新的觀點，我們會考慮。如果我們是書面給他，或是同事要求，甚至我們不是書面，而是口頭給予同事一些意見或看法，同事有回饋給我們，或他有要求，我們都會放在人事檔案。如果我們以書面給他，他書面回給我們，我們都會放在人事檔案。至於事件中的個別同事，因與他的私隱有關，是他自己的事情，所以我不便透露。

記者：有兩條問題。剛才說有疏忽的首長級人員是誰？劉女士的調查報告會不會公開﹖第二條問題是如果陳嘉信不是碰巧退休的話，其實他的銀紫荊星章，即是否他沒有被處分？如果有的話，處分是甚麼﹖

公務員事務局局長：我重申不會就任何問及紀律懲處中的人員身分，或者對身分的一些猜測作回應的，因為我們需要保障同事的私隱，而個人資料私隱專員公署亦有明確守則，我們作為僱主需要遵守的，這是第一點。第二，陳先生現在還未退休，是退休前休假，我們今次對他的做法完全與他是否退休是沒有關係的。即使是一個在任的同事，我們是基於事實得出結論，都會有同樣的做法。

LCSD's new measures to combat touting activities take effect tomorrow,2026-01-20 17:00,2026-01-20 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000239.htm,"  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) reminds SmartPLAY users that the new measures to combat unauthorised transfer of bookings of LCSD recreation and sports facilities/venues (commonly referred to as touting activities) will take effect tomorrow (January 21).

  SmartPLAY has introduced new conditions prohibiting the use of computer programmes or other automated tools to book facilities or interfere with the normal operation of the system. Any breach will result in the suspension of the account concerned for 360 days without prior notice.

  The LCSD only accepts bookings made through the official SmartPLAY website, the My SmartPLAY mobile app or smart self-service stations at various leisure venues (including the 18 District Leisure Services Offices) by normal manual procedures. Any attempt to bypass the normal booking procedures or interfere with the normal operation of the system will constitute a breach of the conditions.

二零二五年十月至十二月失業及就業不足統計數字,2026-01-20 16:30,2026-01-20 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000483.htm,"根據政府統計處今日（一月二十日）發表的最新勞動人口統計數字（即二零二五年十月至十二月的臨時數字），二零二五年十月至十二月經季節性調整的失業率為3.8%，與二零二五年九月至十一月的數字相同。就業不足率則由二零二五年九月至十一月的1.6%上升至二零二五年十月至十二月的1.7%。

與二零二五年九月至十一月比較，在二零二五年十月至十二月期間，各行業的失業率（不經季節性調整）變動不一，但幅度普遍輕微。就業不足率方面，上升主要見於運輸業和資訊及通訊業。同期，清潔及同類活動業的就業不足率錄得下跌。

總就業人數由二零二五年九月至十一月的3 669 900人，下跌至二零二五年十月至十二月的3 667 000人，減少約2 900人。同期的總勞動人口亦由3 814 300人下跌至3 805 200人，減少約9 100人。

失業人數（不經季節性調整）由二零二五年九月至十一月的144 400人下跌至二零二五年十月至十二月的138 200人，減少約6 200人。同期的就業不足人數則由60 900人上升至64 800人，增加約3 900人。

評論

勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡評論最新失業數字時表示：「二零二五年十月至十二月經季節性調整的失業率維持在3.8%，與上一個三個月期間相同。就業不足率微升0.1個百分點至1.7%。同期勞動人口和總就業人數輕微下跌，失業人數亦進一步減少。」

展望未來，孫玉菡說：「香港經濟持續增長，加上本地消費氣氛改善，應有助穩定勞工市場。然而，部分行業的就業情況或會因經營環境的挑戰而繼續受到影響。」

進一步資料

失業和就業不足的統計數字，是根據持續進行的「綜合住戶統計調查」結果而編製。

統計調查所採用有關失業及就業不足的定義，緊隨國際勞工組織的建議。當中，就業人口涵蓋所有僱主、自營作業者、僱員（包括全職、兼職及散工等）和無酬家庭從業員。而按行業（或職業）劃分的失業人士是按其以前從事的行業（或職業）劃分。

二零二五年十月至十二月的統計調查所用的樣本，是通過一個根據科學方法設計的抽樣系統選出，包括約26 000個住戶，共約68 000人，以代表本港人口的情況。根據這個樣本編製而成的勞工統計數字反映二零二五年十月至十二月的移動三個月期間的情況。

統計調查是向樣本中各住戶內每名15歲或以上的成員進行訪問，以搜集有關勞動人口特徵的資料。

Unemployment and underemployment statistics for October - December 2025,2026-01-20 16:30,2026-01-20 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000494.htm,"  According to the latest labour force statistics (i.e. provisional figures for October - December 2025) released today (January 20) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stood at 3.8% in October - December 2025, same as that in September - November 2025. The underemployment rate increased from 1.6% in September - November 2025 to 1.7% in October - December 2025.

  Comparing October - December 2025 with September - November 2025, movements in the unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) in different industry sectors varied, but the magnitudes were generally small. As to the underemployment rate, increases were mainly seen in the transportation sector and information and communications sector. Meanwhile, a decline in the underemployment rate was seen in the cleaning and similar activities sector.

  Total employment decreased by around 2 900 from 3 669 900 in September - November 2025 to 3 667 000 in October - December 2025. Over the same period, the labour force also decreased by around 9 100 from 3 814 300 to 3 805 200.

  The number of unemployed persons (not seasonally adjusted) decreased by around 6 200 from 144 400 in September - November 2025 to 138 200 in October - December 2025. Over the same period, the number of underemployed persons increased by around 3 900 from 60 900 to 64 800.

Commentary

  Commenting on the latest unemployment figures, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, said, ""The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at 3.8% in October - December 2025, same as that in the preceding three-month period. The underemployment rate edged up by 0.1 percentage point to 1.7%. Over the same period, the labour force and total employment decreased slightly, and the number of unemployed persons also decreased further.""

  Looking ahead, Mr Chris Sun said, ""The continued growth of the Hong Kong economy and the improvement in local consumption sentiment should help stabilise the labour market. Nonetheless, the employment situations in some sectors may continue to be affected by their challenging business conditions.""

Further information

  The unemployment and underemployment statistics were compiled from the findings of the continuous General Household Survey.

  In the survey, the definitions used in measuring unemployment and underemployment follow closely those recommended by the International Labour Organization. The employed population covers all employers, self-employed persons, employees (including full-time, part-time, casual workers, etc.) and unpaid family workers. Unemployed persons by industry (or occupation) are classified according to their previous industry (or occupation).

  The survey for October - December 2025 covered a sample of some 26 000 households or 68 000 persons, selected in accordance with a scientifically designed sampling scheme to represent the population of Hong Kong. Labour force statistics compiled from this sample represented the situation in the moving three-month period of October to December 2025.

  Data on labour force characteristics were obtained from the survey by interviewing each member aged 15 or over in the sampled households.

  Statistical tables on the latest labour force statistics can be downloaded at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/scode200.html). More detailed analysis of the labour force characteristics is given in the ""Quarterly Report on General Household Survey"" which is published four times a year. The latest issue of the report contains statistics for the quarter July - September 2025 while the next issue covering the quarter October - December 2025 will be available by end February 2026.

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-20 16:23,2026-01-20 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000597.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月二十日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

有關更多健康資訊，可致電衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111），或參閱衞生防護中心網頁和Facebook專頁，以及勞工處於在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，對僱主及僱員發布應採取預防措施的新聞公報。

CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-20 16:23,2026-01-20 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000600.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 20) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

Digital Policy Office holds annual Cybersecurity Symposium (with photos),2026-01-20 16:22,2026-01-20 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000320.htm,"  The Cybersecurity Symposium convened today (January 20). The Symposium was co-organised by the Digital Policy Office (DPO) and the Hong Kong Internet Registration Corporation Limited, with the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau of the Hong Kong Police Force and the Hong Kong Cybersecurity Professional Association being the strategic partners.

  Under the theme ""Navigating Cybersecurity Trends, Strengthening Organisational Defence"", the Symposium featured eight keynote speeches and five panel discussions covering key topics including emerging threats, cybersecurity trends, attack and defence strategies, protection of the computer systems of critical infrastructure, and AI. More than 30 experts from the Government, academia, technology, telecommunications, finance, and insurance sectors were invited as speakers and around 1 000 cybersecurity professionals and industry leaders from various sectors attended the Symposium.

  The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, officiated and delivered the welcome remarks at the Symposium. He said, ""Technological development and security protection must be pursued in tandem. Innovation and technology (I&T) can truly benefit society only when it is built on the foundation of safety and reliability. Hong Kong is determined to become an international I&T centre, and will actively support national strategies, and fully leverage the institutional strengths and professional capabilities to build a robust stronghold for digital security.""

  Professor Sun emphasised that cyberattacks and defence today are no longer confined to technical confrontations, but have evolved into a global race that transcends geographical boundaries and integrates intelligence. He also urged all sectors of the community to work together and take practical actions to strengthen cybersecurity defence, thereby ensuring that Hong Kong will not only become a pioneer in developing the digital economy, but also a guardian of cybersecurity.

  The Deputy Commissioner for Digital Policy (Digital Infrastructure), Mr Daniel Cheung, delivered a keynote speech at the Symposium, presenting the DPO's major cybersecurity strategies and initiatives in 2025. He stated that the DPO laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong's cybersecurity through various areas, including internal government protection measures, public promotion and support, national and international collaboration, and talent development. The DPO also co-ordinated efforts across various sectors to ensure robust cybersecurity preparations and the smooth execution of several large-scale major events in the second half of last year. He also shared the outcomes of the second Hong Kong Cybersecurity Attack and Defence Drill, which was co-ordinated by the DPO in October last year. He said that last year's drill was further expanded in scale to cover more public services, thereby providing a more comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity defence and response capabilities of government departments and public organisations with significant results.

  The Cybersecurity Symposium aimed to bring together industry experts to discuss the opportunities and challenges faced by public and private organisations across the three key dimensions of policy, technology, and operations. The participants explored the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape, fostered collaboration and knowledge exchanges between public and private organisations, and thereby further strengthening Hong Kong's cybersecurity resilience. A cybersecurity solutions and services exhibition was also held alongside the Symposium to showcase the latest technologies and offer enterprises and organisations opportunities to engage directly with cybersecurity service providers, share practical experiences and forge connections."

孫東教授強調當今網絡攻防已不再純粹是技術對抗，而是跨越地域、融合智能的全域較量。他亦呼籲社會各界並肩前行，以務實行動築牢安全防線，使香港不只成為發展數字經濟的「先行者」，更擔當網絡安全的「守護者」。

此外，副數字政策專員（數字基建）張宜偉於論壇專題演講中回顧二零二五年數字辦在網絡安全領域的主要策略與措施。他表示數字辦在政府內部的保護措施、社會推廣與支援、及與國家及國際合作和人才培育等多方面，為香港的網絡安全奠定了堅實基礎，並協調各界為去年下半年多項大型重要活動作好網安準備，確保各項盛事順利舉行。 他亦分享了數字辦於去年十月統籌主辦的第二屆香港網絡安全攻防演練的成果。他表示，去年的整體演練規模進一步擴大並涵蓋更多公共服務，更廣泛地檢驗了政府及公共機構的網安防護與應變能力，成效顯著。

網絡安全技術論壇旨在匯聚業界精英，從政策、技術與營運三大層面全方位探討公私營機構面臨的機遇與挑戰。與會者共同探討瞬息萬變的網絡安全形勢，加強公私營機構之間的協作與經驗分享，進一步提升本港網絡安全韌性。現場同時設有網絡安全方案和服務展覽，展示最新的技術方案，協助企業及機構即時與網絡安全服務供應商交流經驗，建立聯繫。"

發展局邀請市場就使用三幅已平整用地發展專上教育學生宿舍提交意向書,2026-01-20 15:15,2026-01-20 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000381.htm,"發展局今日（一月二十日）邀請市場就使用三幅分別位於啟德、沙田小瀝源及東涌東的商業用地發展專上教育學生宿舍，於兩個月內提交意向書。

發展局聯同教育局於二○二五年七月推出「城中學舍計劃」，透過放寬發展管制措施，促成私營發展商／營辦商改裝商廈成為學生宿舍，照顧專上院校學生的需要。其後，二○二五年《施政報告》宣布將計劃擴展至涵蓋新建的學生宿舍。

計劃反應理想，至今已收到24宗共涉及約5000個宿位的申請，大多位於市區。除兩宗涉及於私人土地興建新學生宿舍外，其餘為改裝現有建築物，大部分涉及整幢改裝。24宗申請當中22宗已獲確認符合計劃資格（註），其餘兩宗處理當中。該22宗個案的負責方正陸續按放寬發展管制措施尋求審批，有關政府部門正全速處理收到的規劃申請（註：22宗個案當中有18宗毋須規劃申請）及建築圖則。

發展局發言人表示：「除利便市場改裝現有商廈及在現有私人土地興建該等宿舍，正如二○二五年《施政報告》建議，我們亦可透過賣地方式推出合適作學生宿舍發展的用地。這將是我們首次透過於公開市場賣地，鼓勵學生宿舍發展。」

意向書邀請文件（邀請文件）建議的三幅用地均位於市區或擴展市區，交通相對便利，附近社區及商業設施亦比較完善。這些用地在相關分區計劃大綱圖（大綱圖）劃為「商業」用途，換言之按計劃發展學生宿舍將毋須另行提交規劃申請。有關用地已作土地平整，並具備基本基建。

發言人表示：「三幅用地都是『熟地』，且在規劃用途和發展參數方面適宜作學生宿舍，好讓中標者在最短時間內建成學生宿舍，以回應專上學生宿位需求。視乎收集到的市場意向，政府最早可於二○二六／二七年度透過公開招標，推出其中一幅或多幅用地供發展學生宿舍。」

為提升優質宿位供應，從而促進教育樞紐發展的政策目標，發展局初步擬在地契中限制有關土地只可以作學生宿舍用途，並加入轉讓限制不能賣散，即如需轉讓，只可以整個發展轉讓，以確保用地上的學生宿舍能整體發展及營運。建築規約期暫建議為48個月。發展局將透過邀請文件邀請發展商表達對競投一幅或多幅用地的興趣，闡述營運宿舍的初步計劃，並就賣地安排提供意見，包括上述擬議轉讓限制和建築規約期。政府初步估計三幅用地總共可提供約4 500個宿位，但最終宿位數目則視乎項目倡議方提出的設計。三幅用地的發展參數載於邀請文件的附件A，用地的主要資料概述如下：

啟德用地

Development Bureau invites market to submit expressions of interest for student hostel development on three formed sites,2026-01-20 15:15,2026-01-20 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000386.htm,"The Development Bureau (DEVB) today (January 20) invites the market to submit expressions of interest (EOI) within two months for post-secondary student hostel development at three commercial sites in Kai Tak, Siu Lek Yuen (Shatin), and Tung Chung East.

In July 2025, the DEVB and the Education Bureau (EDB) jointly launched the Hostels in the City Scheme. By relaxing some development controls, it has facilitated private developers/operators in converting commercial buildings into student hostels to meet the needs of post-secondary students. Subsequently, it was announced in the 2025 Policy Address that the Scheme would be expanded to also cover new hostel developments.

The Scheme has been met with an encouraging response, with 24 applications received involving around 5000 beds in total, most of which were in urban areas. Apart from two applications that concern new student hostel development on private land, all applications were for the conversion of existing buildings, the majority of which involved wholesale conversion. Out of the 24 applications received, 22 have been confirmed to have complied with the eligibility criteria (Note) as laid down under the Scheme, with the remaining two under processing. Proponents of these 22 cases are starting to apply for development approvals under relaxed development controls, while the relevant government departments are processing at full steam the planning applications (Note: 18 out of 22 cases do not require a planning application) and the building plans received.

A DEVB spokesman said, ""The 2025 Policy Address has recommended that suitable sites for student hostel development be put up through land sale, besides facilitating the market in converting existing commercial buildings and building hostels on existing private land. This would be the first time for us to use land disposal in the open market to encourage the development of student hostels.""

All three sites included in this EOI exercise are located in urban or extended urban areas with better traffic accessibility and more mature community and commercial facilities in the vicinity. These sites are zoned ""Commercial"" on the respective Outline Zoning Plans, meaning developing student hostels according to the Scheme would not require further planning applications. The relevant land has already been formed with basic infrastructure.

The spokesman said, ""The three sites are all readily developable land where zoning and development parameters are suitable for student hostel developments. Those who are awarded the sites through tender could promptly develop these sites into student hostels and help respond to the demand for post-secondary hostel accommodation. Subject to the response received from this EOI exercise, the Government can make available one or more of the three sites supporting student hostel development for land sale through open tender in 2026-27 at the earliest.

In order to properly serve the policy objective of promoting the development of an education hub through increasing the supply of quality hostel places, the DEVB is initially planning to restrict under the lease the use of the sites to student hostels only and impose a restriction against alienation of individual rooms, meaning alienation is only allowed for the entire development as a whole, so as to ensure the hostel facilities on each of the sites are cohesively owned and operated. The Building Covenant period is now proposed to be 48 months. Respondents to the EOI exercise are invited to indicate their interest in bidding for one or more of the sites, share their preliminary plans for the hostel operation, and provide views on the land disposal arrangements including the above proposed alienation restriction and the Building Covenant period. The Government's preliminary estimate is that around 4500 beds can be provided in total on the three sites, but the actual bed numbers will depend on the design of the project proponents. Development parameters of the three sites are summarised in Annex A to the invitation document of this EOI exercise. Some salient features of the sites are highlighted as follows:

Site in Kai Tak

The site in Kai Tak is located at the former South Apron area of the Kai Tak Development Area, near the Kai Tak Sports Park and adjacent to the New Acute Hospital that is expected to commence operation this year. Nearby MTR stations include Kai Tak Station and Kowloon Bay Station. Its site area is around 0.74 hectares (ha) and is subject to a maximum plot ratio (PR) of 5.8, a building height restriction (BHR) of 80mPD, a maximum site coverage of 65 per cent, and a maximum gross floor area (GFA) of around 43000 square metres (sq m).

Site in Siu Lek Yuen, Shatin

The immediate area of the site in Siu Lek Yuen is intermixed with commercial, residential, and other uses and is in proximity to the MTR City One Station and Shek Mun Station. Of around 0.11ha, the site is subject to a maximum PR of 9.5, a BHR of 120mPD, and a maximum GFA of around 10000 sq m. 

Site in Tung Chung East

The site in Tung Chung New Town Extension is located close to the MTR Tung Chung East Station that is expected to commence operation in 2029. Its site area is around 0.25 ha and is subject to a maximum PR of 9, a BHR of 160mPD, and a maximum GFA of around 23000 sq m.

The invitation documents for EOI have been uploaded onto the DEVB's website (www.devb.gov.hk/en/issues_in_focus/planning-lands/invitation-for-expression-of-interest-for-student/index.html). Interested parties should submit a soft copy of their EOI by midnight on March 20 (Friday).

Note: The eligibility criteria include that hostel tenants should be full-time local or non-local students enrolled in locally accredited sub-degree or degree programmes operated by specified institutions; new hostel construction and conversion works must be completed within 54 and 18 months respectively; and industrial zonings and industrial buildings are not eligible under the Scheme."
