性罪行定罪紀錄查核機制擴大至涵蓋志願工作者,2025-12-15 09:30,2025-12-15 09:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121200595.htm,"為進一步加強對兒童及精神上無行為能力人士的保護，政府今日（十二月十五日）起擴大性罪行定罪紀錄查核機制涵蓋範圍至志願工作者。同時，政府亦增設三間指定警署，為合資格申請人提供24小時套取指紋服務。

政府發言人說：「志願工作者包括但不限於義教老師、義務運動教練等。查核機制仍屬自願性質，由招募機構自行評估風險後考慮查核需要，並由合資格申請人辦理申請。」

為進一步便利申請人，除位於灣仔警察總部的性罪行定罪紀錄查核辦事處及現有的六間指定警署（北角、油麻地、牛頭角、屯門、沙田及荃灣）外，警務處增設三間指定警署（將軍澳、上水和大嶼山北（東涌）），以提供24小時套取指紋服務。合資格申請人可透過網上平台遞交申請及預約前往提交指紋。

政府自二○一一年底推行查核機制，讓僱主查核從事與兒童或精神上無行為能力人士有關工作的人士，有否任何指明列表中的性罪行刑事定罪紀錄。在推行時，查核機制的合資格申請人涵蓋向機構或企業應徵與兒童或精神上無行為能力人士有關工作的準僱員、合約續期僱員，以及由外判機構派往其他機構或企業提供有關工作的僱員。

香港法律改革委員會（法改會）於二○二二年五月發表《性罪行檢討中的判刑及相關事項》，建議擴大查核機制涵蓋範圍至所有現有僱員、自僱人士和志願工作者。

為加強對兒童或精神上無行為能力人士的保障並回應法改會的建議，政府已由二○二四年底實施擴展計劃的第一階段，把查核機制的涵蓋範圍擴展至準自僱人士，並推出首階段優化措施，包括推出網上申請、24小時套取指紋服務及延長查核申請的有效期至36個月，以方便申請人。

發言人說：「政府會參考在首兩個階段將查核機制涵蓋範圍擴大至準自僱人士和志願工作者的相關經驗，適時考慮將涵蓋範圍擴展至所有現有僱員及自僱人士，以達成最終目標。屆時會再公布詳情。」"
Sexual Conviction Record Check Scheme expanded to cover volunteers,2025-12-15 09:30,2025-12-15 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121200598.htm,"To further strengthen the protection of children and mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs), the Government expanded the Sexual Conviction Record Check (SCRC) Scheme to cover volunteers today (December 15). Meanwhile, three additional designated police stations were introduced to provide eligible applicants with a 24-hour fingerprint taking service.

A spokesperson for the Government said, ""Volunteers include, but are not limited to, volunteer teachers and volunteer sports coaches. The SCRC Scheme remains voluntary in nature. The recruiting organisations may decide whether the SCRC is necessary after assessing the risks. Applications are to be submitted by the eligible applicants.""

In addition to the existing SCRC Office at the Police Headquarters in Wan Chai and the six existing designated police stations (North Point, Yau Ma Tei, Ngau Tau Kok, Tuen Mun, Sha Tin and Tsuen Wan), the Police designated three additional police stations to provide a 24-hour fingerprint-taking service, namely Tseung Kwan O, Sheung Shui and Lantau North (Tung Chung) to further facilitate the making of applications. Eligible applicants can submit applications through the online applications platform and make appointments for fingerprint taking.

The Government implemented the SCRC Scheme at the end of 2011 to enable employers to check whether persons undertaking child-related or MIPs-related work have any criminal conviction records against a specified list of sexual offences. When it was launched, the SCRC Scheme covered prospective employees, contract renewal staff and staff assigned by outsourced service providers to other organisations or enterprises, who apply for child-related or MIP-related work to organisations or enterprises.

In May 2022, the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong (LRC) published a report on Sentencing and Related Matters in the Review of Sexual Offences, which recommended the expansion of the SCRC Scheme to all existing employees, self-employed persons and volunteers.

To enhance the protection to children and MIPs, and respond to the LRC's recommendations, the Government expanded the scope of the SCRC Scheme at the end of 2024 as phase 1 to cover prospective self-employed persons. A series of measures has been implemented at the same time to enhance the SCRC Scheme, including the launch of online applications, the introduction of a 24-hour fingerprint-taking service and the extension of the validity period to 36 months, bringing greater convenience to applicants.

""The Government will review the relevant experiences in expanding the scope of the SCRC Scheme to prospective self-employed persons and volunteers in the first two phases, and consider expanding the scope to cover all existing employees and self-employed persons at a suitable juncture, thus achieving the ultimate goal. Details will be available nearer the time,"" the spokesman said."

Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-14 21:37,2025-12-14 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/14/P2025121400669.htm,"  The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

   For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3.4 billion as of noon today (December 14). With the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.7 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

Medical support
--------------------

  To ensure the affected residents receive more comprehensive medical support, the Health Bureau (HHB) will launch freeChinese medicine (CM)consultation service starting tomorrow(December 15). Under the co-ordination of the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) and the Chinese Medicine Unit of the HHB, 150 CM practitioners have participated in the free CM consultation services, covering more than 170 service points. Starting from tomorrow until February 28, 2026, all residents of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers) can receive up to three free CM consultation services, including the provision of medication and related treatments based on their clinical needs, through the arrangement of the District Health Centres/ District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts in Hong Kong. The scope of free CM consultation services covers health conditions that may arise after the fire, such as emotional changes, insomnia, palpitations; coughing, wheezing, dry throat, and itchy throat; physical weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite, dyspepsia; as well as pain and musculoskeletal injuries.

  Meanwhile, PHC Commission has earlier announced the establishment of a free family doctor service scheme to support the affected residents. Serving as hubs, the DHCs across all 18 districts in Hong Kong have arranged case managers to follow up on the primary healthcare needs of the affected residents comprehensively. Based on the situations of individual cases and the preferences of affected residents, case managers will pair them with private sector family doctors participating in the scheme or the Hospital Authority's Family Medicine Out-patient Services.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

   As of this morning, a total of 1 390 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 3 235 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS).

   Currently, there is still an abundant supply of more than 1 000 units that can provide affected residents with longer term accommodation. The transitional housing and HKHS projects in different districts can altogether provide around 400 units at the moment. Besides, Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun and Runway 1331 at Kai Tak can provide an immediate supply of around 800 units.

   In consideration of the extremely urgent situation of the residents affected by the fire incident, a special arrangement of a full rent exemption has been made earlier by the Housing Bureau to provide accommodation support to those affected residents moving into transitional housing or HKHS projects. In other words, if needed, the affected residents can stay for a longer period of time. The Government will continue to support the affected residents in terms of accommodation, and the residents in need do not have to worry about the relevant rental expenses or the duration of stay.

   In addition, staff from the operating organisations of transitional housing and HKHS, as well as volunteers have been working around the clock to furnish the units with essential supplies, striving to meet the needs of the residents. Taking Kai Fook Kui in Kai Tak as an example, each unit is equipped, upon move-in, with furniture and appliances such as bed frames, mattresses, cooking stoves and water heaters. Furthermore, thoughtful members of the community have donated toys and musical instruments for children and elderly in need, bringing them warmth and care.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 800 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, about 23 000 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-14 17:30,2025-12-14 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/14/P2025121400465.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 14), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 79 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. As the CHP and the relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, the CHP continues to appeal to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373). All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
