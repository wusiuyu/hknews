Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-08 22:40,2025-12-08 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800940.htm,"  The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

  For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3 billion as of noon today (December 8). In addition to the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.3 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

  The Government earlier announced that the Support Fund will provide a living allowance to each affected household. As of today, 1 357 cases have been processed. The living allowance is increased from $50,000 to $100,000 and will be disbursed in phases. In addition, the Support Fund will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 95 cases have been processed.

  In addition, the Government has so far disbursed an emergency subsidy of $10,000 to 1 932 households, and the relevant disbursement is largely complete.

  Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 970 affected households, and more than 4 900 residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. SWD staff also paid visits to the affected residents staying in transitional housing units in Yuen Long today and distributed Octopus cards with a face value of $2,000 to facilitate their daily travels and address their imminent needs. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government. Those not yet in touch with the SWD are advised to leave their contact information by calling 182 183 as soon as possible.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

  As of this morning, a total of 1 422 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 2 522 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society. Moreover, the Tai Po District Office continues to operate a temporary shelter at Tai Po Community Centre, which remains open to residents in need. The other temporary shelter at Tung Cheong Street Community Hall will remain in operation until the existing users have relocated to arranged emergency accommodations.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 600 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, over 5 700 pieces of donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Handling of reported missing persons
------------------------------------------

  Officers from the Disaster Victim Identification Unit continued to search the area around the buildings and near the collapsed scaffolding today, which had been confirmed as safe. No human remains were found, and the number of deceased remains at 159. The Police have contacted the families of the missing persons and those who have preliminarily identified the deceased through photographs to arrange for them to undergo DNA oral swab sampling in batches starting today for scientific identification of the deceased.

Regulation and inspection work
-----------------------------------

  The emergency maintenance contractors co-ordinated by the Housing Department have completed the clearance of the miscellaneous items at the surroundings of the buildings at Wang Fuk Court today. The Independent Checking Unit (ICU) of the Housing Bureau also continued to extract concrete core samples from the affected buildings today. So far, five buildings have been covered.

  The ICU has conducted inspections on the scaffoldings of the four Home Ownership Scheme courts, namely Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po, On Kay Court in Kwun Tong, Sui Wo Court in Sha Tin and Ching Lai Court in Sham Shui Po, as well as Fung Wah Estate in Chai Wan under the Tenants Purchase Scheme. Miscellaneous items were found on some scaffoldings. The contractor is removing the items. The ICU will closely monitor the progress.

  Regarding the order to remove scaffold nets issued by the Buildings Department (BD), as of 5pm today, 227 private buildings have had their scaffold nets removed from the external walls (including two cases completed by government contractors). Work on the remaining three cases, in which the BD has accepted an extension of time, is underway and is expected to finish within this week.

  The BD is striving to announce a new set of arrangements within this week that will require scaffold nets used at construction sites to be sampled on-site and certified as compliant with the relevant standards prior to installation, so that the relevant external wall work can resume as soon as possible.

  The Labour Department (LD) continues to inspect fire protection facilities and the fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding to ensure the occupational safety of workers. As of 4pm today, the LD has inspected 351 construction sites, issued a total of 180 written warnings and 96 improvement notices, and has taken out 25 prosecutions."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-12-08 22:30,2025-12-08 22:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800927.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月八日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得78宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，10宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

鑑於近期部分確診個案報稱曾在青衣自然徑行山期間被蚊叮咬，中心評估該徑風險較高。中心繼續呼籲近期曾在青衣北一帶活動或在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電早前設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。熱線會繼續由上午九時至下午八時運作。中心在上月底亦已透過基層醫療署通知葵青區內約130名基層醫療醫生，呼籲他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。

特別針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾、以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持分者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

另外，就日前公布的一宗本地個案（涉及一名居於上環的23歲女子），流行病學調查仍然繼續進行。

中心繼續呼籲在上環皇后大道西（近摩利臣街和荷李活道一帶）居住或上班的市民，如於十一月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員會繼續接觸上述地點的市民，提醒他們留意有否相關病徵和注意家居環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過於上環文娛中心正門入口處設立的醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於上述受影響地區進行上門探訪，為逾2 700名在當區工作或居住的市民進行評估，而過去三日未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。中心已為兩名早前出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查，全部樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。鑑於近日僅有零星市民前往醫護站，加上全部於上述醫護站接受抽血檢查的人士結果均為陰性，相關醫護站將由明日起停止運作。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-08 22:30,2025-12-08 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800928.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 8), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 78 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 10 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  As some confirmed CF cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considered the trails to be a higher-risk area. The CHP continued to urge individuals who have recently visited the Tsing Yi North area or hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which was set up earlier. The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. In late November, the CHP also informed approximately 130 primary care doctors in Kwai Tsing District through the Primary Healthcare Commission, urging them to closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

  Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department and Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

   Meanwhile, regarding the recently announced local case involving a23-year-old female living in Sheung Wan, the epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

  The CHP continued to urge the members of the public residing and working at Queen's Road West (near Morrison Street and Hollywood Road) who experienced a fever, rash or joint pain on or after November 15 to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately. CHP officers continued to reach out to individuals in the aforementioned locations to remind individuals to be aware of relevant symptoms and to maintain good environmental hygiene in their households.

  As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 2 700 individuals residing or working in the district through the health consultation booth at the main entrance of the Sheung Wan Civic Centre, its enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past three days. Two individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests. All tested negative for the chikungunya virus. Since the health consultation booth has only sporadic visits recently and all individuals who underwent blood tests have returned negative results, the booth will cease operation starting tomorrow.

  Furthermore, the FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected cannabis buds at airport (with photo),2025-12-08 21:56,2025-12-08 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800859.htm,"âHong Kong Customs yesterday (December 7) detected a drug trafficking case involving baggage concealment at Hong Kong International Airport and seized about 23 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with an estimated market value of about $4.7 million. Two persons suspected to be connected with the case were arrested.

Two male passengers, aged 43 and 58, arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds in the check-in suitcases possessed by them. The duo was subsequently arrested.

An investigation is ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
"DH continues to organise ""HIV Testing Month"" to promote normalisation of HIV testing",2025-12-08 21:37,2025-12-08 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800842.htm,"âThe Department of Health (DH) today (December 8) said that, with the concerted efforts of the government, the healthcare sector and non-governmental organisations, the prevalence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection among the adult population in Hong Kong remains at 0.1 per cent, well below the global average, and the number of new HIV cases recorded also continues to decline for nine consecutive years since 2015, demonstrating the effectiveness of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) prevention and control in Hong Kong. Like last year, the DH launches ""HIV Testing Month 2025"" in December to raise public awareness and knowledge on prevention of HIV infection, and to promote normalisation of HIV testing.

The Government has attached great importance to HIV infection control and prevention. Since the first case of HIV infection reported in Hong Kong in 1984, the Government has adopted a multipronged approach to prevent and control AIDS, including the provision of free, anonymous and confidential HIV testing services to the public, and comprehensive risk assessment, counselling and support services to individuals undergoing testing. Although the prevalence of HIV infection in Hong Kong remains at a low level, the proportion of late presenters has been as high as 40 to 60 per cent in recent years. There was an even higher proportion of late presenters, up to 60 to 70 per cent, among those who do not belong to the high-risk populations.Those who do not belong to the high-risk populations may have overlooked that they still have the risk of HIV infection even though they do not have frequent high-risk sexual practices, leading to delayed testing and treatment.

The DH launched the inaugural ""HIV Testing Month"" last year in December. Around 40 per cent of the participants who received testing through various activities during the ""HIV Testing Month"" last year did not belong to the high-risk populations, and about 40 per cent were tested for the first time. Eight persons were confirmed to have HIV infection, including two late presenters. The campaign not only successfully links people who are unaware of their infection status to receive timely diagnosis and treatment, but also promotes normalisation of HIV testing that helps remove the stigma associated with HIV infection and testing. The DH encourages people who have had sex to undergo HIV testing at least once, especially individuals who do not belong to the high-risk populations. The DH emphasised that early testing allows individuals with HIV to promptly receive specialist care, and through antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression and immune recovery, thereby preventing health deterioration.

""The DH, in collaboration with 26 collaborating and supporting organisations, continue to organise 'HIV Testing Month' in December this year, with a view to promoting the message 'For your health, Get tested for HIV' to more stakeholders and bodies in the community, as well as providing an enabling environment for members of the public to undergo HIV testing easily and conveniently through a variety of channels and testing modalities. Members of the public could order HIV self-test kits on the HIV Testing Service website with free shipping during the 'HIV Testing Month',"" said the Consultant (Special Preventive Programme) of the Public Health Services Branch of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH, Dr Bonnie Wong.

She added that the AIDS hotline (2780 2211)under the DH was operated by professionally trained nurses, offering behavioural risk assessment, counselling and arrangement of HIV antibody test. Members of the public who received HIV testing from non-government channels could also call the hotline for enquiries about follow-up or counselling services. Operating for 40 years, the AIDS hotline has received over 1 500 000 calls, provided over 500 000 counselling services, and conducted nearly 70 000 HIV antibody tests.

案情涉及二○二二年五月七日佐敦一個住宅單位維修工程中發生的致命意外，一名搭棚工人在該單位外牆預備搭建懸空式棚架時，墮下至地面身亡。

一名承建商因違反《建築地盤（安全）規例》被勞工處檢控，於二○二四年十一月八日在觀塘裁判法院被判罰款九萬元，並獲准以每月一千元、分90期的方式繳付罰款。

判刑後，控方就有關承建商的刑罰向法庭提出覆核申請。覆核聆訊今日在觀塘裁判法院進行。該名承建商的罰款被提高至十六萬元，以及扣除已經繳交的罰款一萬二千元後，以每月二千元、分74期的方式繳付罰款。

勞工處發言人表示，裁決向所有承建商發出強烈信息，必須依法保障工人工作安全及健康。控方會繼續留意法院的裁決，對刑罰明顯不足及／或原則犯錯的個案會提出覆核或上訴申請。"
Court makes review decision on sentencing for violating occupational safety and health legislation,2025-12-08 19:17,2025-12-08 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800773.htm,"  âRegarding the sentencing in a fatal industrial accident, the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts today (December 8) handed down a review decision, accepting the prosecution's application for review of an earlier court sentence, increasing the fines imposed on the contractor and shortening the duration, with higher amounts for the monthly instalment of the fines.

  The case involved a fatal accident that occurred on May 7, 2022, at a residential unit under renovation in Jordan. A scaffolder, while preparing to erect a truss-out bamboo scaffold on an external wall, fell to the ground and died.

  The contractor was prosecuted by the Labour Department (LD) for the violation of the Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations, and was fined $90,000 and allowed to pay the fines in 90 instalments of $1,000 per month at the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts on November 8, 2024.

  After the sentencing, the prosecution filed a review application with the court regarding the sentences imposed on the relevant contractor. The review hearing was brought up today before the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts. The fines imposed on the contractor were increased to $160,000 and were payable in 74 instalments of $2,000 per month after deducting the fine of $12,000 that has already been paid.

  A spokesman for the LD said that the ruling will disseminate a strong message to all contractors that they have to protect workers' safety and health at work in accordance with the laws. The prosecution will continue to pay attention to court rulings and will file review or appeal applications for cases where the sentences are manifestly inadequate and/or wrong in principle."

衞生署續推「HIV測試月」　推動愛滋病病毒檢測普及化,2025-12-08 19:07,2025-12-08 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800760.htm,"衞生署今日（十二月八日）表示，在政府與醫護界和非政府組織的共同努力下，本港的愛滋病病毒（HIV）感染率一直遠低於全球平均水平，佔本港成年人口的千分之一，新增個案宗數亦自二○一五年起連續九年下跌，充分反映本港在愛滋病防控工作成效卓越。衞生署今年一如去年，於十二月推行「HIV測試月2025」，以提高公眾對預防HIV感染的關注和認識，促進HIV檢測普及化。

政府一向高度重視HIV感染的防控工作。香港自一九八四年呈報第一宗本地HIV感染個案以來，政府一直以多管齊下的方式應對預防及控制愛滋病，包括為市民提供免費、不記名和保密的HIV抗體測試服務，專業醫護人員亦會同時為接受測試者提供風險評估和心理輔導等全方位支援。雖然本港的HIV感染率持續處於低水平，但近年本港晚發現感染者比例偏高，約佔新感染個案的四至六成。非高風險人群的晚發現感染者比例更高，佔六至七成。非高風險人群可能誤以為沒有持續進行高風險性行為便不會感染，以至未有及時進行HIV檢測而延誤治療。

衞生署去年十二月首次推出「HIV測試月」，透過各項「HIV測試月」活動參與檢測的人士當中近四成為非高風險人群，亦有約四成參與人士是首次進行HIV檢測。八人證實感染HIV，當中兩人為晚發現感染者。活動除成功讓不清楚自身感染狀況的感染者及早接受診斷及治療外，亦推動檢測普及化，有助消除大眾對HIV感染及檢測的負面標籤。衞生署鼓勵曾進行性行為的人士，特別是非高風險人群，最少進行一次HIV檢測，並強調早測試有助受感染人士盡早接受愛滋病專科治理服務，以及透過接受抗愛滋病病毒藥物治療，更快達至抑制病毒及修復免疫系統、避免健康狀況惡化之效。

衞生署衞生防護中心公共衞生服務處顧問醫生（特別預防計劃）黃駿君醫生說：「衞生署今年再接再厲，於十二月聯同26間協辦和支持機構，繼續推動『HIV測試月』，將『HIV 測一次』的信息推廣至更多不同的社區持分者和群體，同時讓公眾透過更多不同途徑及檢測模式，輕鬆便捷地檢測愛滋病。市民於『HIV測試月』期間經HIV測試服務網站訂取HIV自我檢測套裝，可免運費。」

她補充，衞生署設有愛滋熱線2780 2211，由經過專業培訓的護士接聽，為來電者進行風險評估、心理輔導及預約抗體測試服務。市民如透過其他非政府渠道接受HIV抗體測試後，亦可致電熱線查詢後續跟進或接受心理輔導。熱線運作至今已40年，一共處理超過150萬個查詢、提供超過50萬次輔導服務，以及進行近七萬次HIV抗體測試。此外，熱線設有多語言預錄資料，讓不同族裔人士隨時查詢有關愛滋病及性健康資訊。

有興趣接受HIV檢測市民可瀏覽HIV測試服務網站（www.hivtest.gov.hk），連接到HIV測試服務網站的HIV測試月曆，了解及選擇社區上的測試資源。"

Centre for Food Safety announces test results on hot pot food samples (with photo),2025-12-08 18:37,2025-12-08 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800390.htm,"  The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (December 8) announced the test results of a recently completed surveillance project assessing the food safety of hot pot cuisine. A total of 345 hot pot food samples were collected, and all passed the tests.

  A CFS spokesman said, ""Hong Kong people like eating hot pot meals. As food additives such as colouring matters and preservatives may be used during the making of hot pot ingredients, beverages and sauces, the CFS conducted this project in a bid to provide timely food safety information to consumers and the trade.""

  The CFS collected different kinds of hot pot food samples, including meat and meat products (such as beef balls and pork balls), aquatic and related products (such as fish balls, shrimp balls and cuttlefish balls), bean products (such as dried bean curds, tofu and soya bean sticks), noodles, soup bases, beverages (such as juice and sour plum drinks) and sauces, from restaurants, fresh provision shops, supermarkets, groceries, market stalls and retailers (including online retailers) for chemical and microbiological testing.

  Chemical tests included testing for colouring matters, preservatives and metallic contaminants, while microbiological tests for ready-to-eat food included testing for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella and coagulase-positive staphylococci.

  The spokesman reminded the public that food safety is a shared responsibility and that all those involved in the food supply chain - from farms and food manufacturers to food handlers and consumers - should put in place safety measures. He advised the trade not to entertain orders beyond handling capacity. The trade should also comply with legal requirements, follow Good Manufacturing Practices, use permitted food additives in an appropriate manner, and check the quality of food and ingredients upon delivery.

  Furthermore, the spokesman advised food handlers and consumers to apply the following Five Keys to Food Safety when handling and preparing food:

Choose wisely
---------------
* Patronise reliable shops and select fresh and hygienic foods for hot pot ingredients;
* For prepackaged foods or soup bases, check whether the packaging is intact and if the selected foods are expired; and
* For online purchases, buy from reliable online shops with licences, and pay attention to the nature and potential risks associated with food items purchased online.

Keep clean
------------
* Observe good food, environmental and personal hygiene when preparing foods. All food ingredients must be thoroughly washed;
* Poultry meat, pork and beef should be washed and sliced into thin strips for easy cooking;
* For shellfish like scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove the internal organs;
* Before eating and handling food ingredients, wash hands thoroughly with liquid soap and water, and rub for at least 20 seconds; and
* If there is a wound on the hand, cover it properly with a waterproof bandage or put on a glove before handling food.

Separate raw and cooked food
----------------------------------
* When shopping for hot pot ingredients, buy prepackaged foods first and raw meat, poultry and seafood last;
* When shopping for or delivering food, raw foods should be kept separately from other ready-to-eat foods or cooked foods to prevent cross-contamination; and
* Handle raw and cooked foods carefully and separate them completely during the cooking process. Use separate sets of chopsticks and utensils with different appearances to handle raw and cooked foods, and avoid contact between raw and cooked foods on the table to prevent cross-contamination.

Cook thoroughly
------------------
* During the whole eating process, take thoroughly cooked food out of the pot only when the soup is boiling completely. Whenever water or soup is added to the pot, wait until it is boiling hot before adding food for cooking;
* Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque. Shellfish should be boiled until their shells open and boiled for a further three to five minutes afterwards. Shucked oysters should be cooked in the boiling water for at least three minutes before consumption;
* Do not consume cooked foods that are mixed with unpasteurised raw eggs to prevent pathogenic or antimicrobial-resistant micro-organisms; and
* Condiments such as soy sauce, vinegar, wine, chili and wasabi cannot kill bacteria or parasites that may be present in hot pot ingredients.

Safe temperature
--------------------
* Most hot pot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees Celsius or below, while frozen foods should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below; and
* Do not thaw frozen foods at room temperature, as bacteria may multiply rapidly in food. It is preferable to defrost frozen foods in a refrigerator, microwave oven or under running water. Thawed foods should be cooked as soon as possible.

""People should also pay attention to the amount of food consumed and follow a balanced diet when having hot pot meals. To reduce fat intake, it is preferable to choose a clear soup base as it contains less fat than bone, satay and mala soup bases. Eat vegetables first to fill oneself up and then meat to prevent overeating. Members of the public should also eat more vegetables with high dietary fibre and less fatty meats and animal offal, and use less sauce and condiments. If there are nutrition labels for hot pot products, make healthier food choices by referring to their nutritional contents and choosing those lower in fat, sodium and sugars,"" the spokesman said."

中心從食肆、新鮮糧食店、超級市場、雜貨店、街市及零售商（包括網上零售商）抽取不同種類的火鍋食物樣本，包括肉類及其製品（包括牛丸、豬肉丸等）、水產及其製品（包括魚蛋、蝦丸、墨魚丸等）、豆製品（包括豆卜、豆腐、枝竹等）、麵條、湯底、飲品（包括果汁、酸梅湯等）和醬料，進行化學和微生物測試。

化學測試包括染色料、防腐劑及金屬雜質；而即食食品的微生物測試包括蠟樣芽孢桿菌、產氣莢膜梭狀芽孢桿菌、沙門氏菌及凝固酶陽性葡萄球菌。

發言人提醒公眾，食物安全是社會各階層的共同責任，食物供應鏈各環節（即由農場、食物製造商到食物從業人員和消費者）均須執行安全措施。他忠告業界不應接受超出生產能力負荷的訂單，並須遵從有關法例規定及符合優良製造規範，適當地使用法例准許的食物添加劑。收貨時，必須檢查食物和食物材料的質量。

此外，發言人建議食物從業人員和消費者在處理食物時應奉行以下的「食物安全五要點」：

精明選擇
－－－－
＊ 到可靠的店鋪選購新鮮及衞生的食物作火鍋材料；
＊ 如選用預先包裝食物或湯底，要檢查包裝是否完好，及有否超逾食用限期；及
＊ 如選擇網購，應向可靠及領有相關牌照的網上商店購買，亦要留意網購食物的性質和潛在風險。

保持清潔
－－－－
＊ 配製食物時，要注意食物、環境及個人衞生，所有食物材料均要徹底清洗乾淨；
＊ 禽肉、豬肉及牛肉清洗後，應切成薄片，較易煮熟；
＊ 將貝類海產（如帶子及象拔蚌等）的外殼洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
＊ 進食及處理食物材料前，雙手必須徹底清洗，用清水和梘液搓手最少20秒；及
＊ 手上如果有傷口，應以防水膠布妥善包紮傷口或戴上手套，才處理食物。

生熟分開
－－－－
＊ 購物時，先選購預先包裝食物，最後才選購生的肉類、家禽和海產；
＊ 在選購和運送食物途中，生的食物應與即食食物或熟食分開擺放，避免交叉污染；及
＊ 在烹煮過程中，小心處理並徹底分開生和熟的食物，使用兩套不同款式的筷子和用具來分開處理生和熟的食物，避免桌上的生熟食物互相接觸而導致交叉污染。

徹底煮熟
－－－－
＊ 在整個進食過程中，要待湯汁徹底煮沸時才把鍋內已徹底煮熟的食物取出。每次加添水或湯汁後，應待水或湯汁沸騰後才再烹煮食物；
＊ 焯蝦應待蝦殼變成紅色而蝦肉變成白色及不透明後才進食。貝類海產則須煮至外殼打開，然後再煮三至五分鐘。至於除殼的蠔，則應在沸水中烹煮最少三分鐘才進食；
＊ 為預防致病或具抗菌素耐藥性的微生物，切勿將熟食蘸上未經巴士德消毒的生蛋後進食；及
＊ 醬油、醋、酒、辣椒和日本芥辣等調味料並不能殺死可能存在於火鍋材料的細菌和寄生蟲。

安全溫度
－－－－
＊ 大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；及
＊ 不應將冷藏食物放在室溫下解凍，否則細菌有機會在食物內快速滋生。可把冷藏食物放在雪櫃冷凍格、微波爐或流動的水喉水下解凍，並盡快烹煮。

發言人說：「享用火鍋時，亦應注意進食分量及營養均衡的原則。為減低脂肪攝入量，最好選擇清湯作湯底，因為它較骨湯、沙茶及麻辣湯底等含較少脂肪。先進食蔬菜然後才進食肉類，增加飽肚感，避免進食過量。此外，市民應多吃膳食纖維豐富的蔬菜，少食脂肪含量較高的肥肉及動物內臟，並盡量少用醬油及調味料。如火鍋產品附有營養標籤，應留意有關營養成分的資料，選擇脂肪、鈉和糖含量較低的食物。」"

Hong Kong Customs alerts public to unsafe wireless laser pen with false trade description (with photos),2025-12-08 17:45,2025-12-08 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800664.htm,"Hong Kong Customs today (December 8) alerted members of the public to the potential risk of injury posed by a model of wireless laser pen and advised them to stop using the product for safety's sake.

Customs officers recently conducted spot checks and test-purchased several models of wireless laser pens for safety testing. Testing results revealed that one of the models had a temperature measurement result of 78.4 degrees Celsius on its reachable shell, which was 35 per cent higher than the allowable limit (i.e. 58°C) in the case of a short circuit in the battery. The product concerned thus failed to comply with relevant international product safety standards and was suspected to be in contravention of the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance (CGSO).

In addition, the wireless laser pen had a ""3R laser pen product category"" affixed. However, the testing results revealed that the product concerned belonged to a stronger laser output power level category, namely 3B. In this regard, the relevant retailer and importer was suspected of violating the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (TDO).

Customs officers subsequently conducted operations and searched the retailer and importer involved in the case. A total of three wireless laser pens of the model concerned were seized. Prohibition notices were also served on the retailer and importer, prohibiting the continued sale of the unsafe wireless laser pen.

Customs officers have conducted spot checks and inspections in various districts and have not found any sales of the wireless laser pen concerned so far. An investigation is ongoing.

Customs reminds members of the public to observe the following safety tips when purchasing and using wireless laser pens:


Purchase wireless laser pens manufactured by well-reputed brands and equipped with short circuit protection devices, including protection devices against overcharging, overcurrent and battery temperature protection;
Charge wireless laser pens in an environment with good ventilation so as not to obstruct heat dissipation from the batteries and to minimise the risk of a short circuit. Devices being charged should not be placed near inflammable articles such as clothes;
Avoid prolonged charging and unplug the wireless laser penafter it is fully charged; and
The beam emitted by laser pens may damage the eyes and skin, and under no circumstances should the light spot emitted by the laser pen be pointed at the eyes.


Customs is committed to the protection of consumer interests and regularly conducts spot checks and safety tests on consumer goods to ensure that they are reasonably safe for use by consumers.

Customs also reminds traders to comply with the statutory requirements of the CGSO to protect the safety of consumers. Under the CGSO, it is an offence to supply, manufacture or import into Hong Kong consumer goods unless the goods comply with the general safety requirements for consumer goods. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for one year for a first conviction, and $500,000 and imprisonment for two years for subsequent convictions.

Under the TDO, any person who supplies goods with a false trade description in the course of trade or business, or who is in possession of any goods for sale with a false trade description, commits a criminal offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

Members of the public may report any suspected violations of the abovementioned ordinances to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

此外，該無線雷射筆附有「3R類雷射筆產品」標籤，但測試結果顯示該產品屬雷射輸出功率等級較強的3B類。因此，有關零售商及入口商涉嫌違反《商品說明條例》。

海關人員其後採取行動，搜查涉案的零售商及入口商，檢獲3枝該款無線雷射筆，並向他們發出禁制通知書，禁止繼續出售該款不安全無線雷射筆。

海關人員亦到全港各區進行巡查，暫沒有再發現該款無線雷射筆出售。案件仍在調查中。

海關建議市民，於選購及使用無線雷射筆時，應注意以下安全事項：

選購由商譽良好的品牌原廠生產並設有短路保護裝置的無線雷射筆，包括防止過度充電、過高電流及電池溫度保護裝置；
將無線雷射筆放置於空氣流通的地方充電，以避免阻礙電池散熱，增加電池短路着火的風險，正在充電的裝置亦不應擺近衣物等易燃物品；
避免長時間充電，當無線雷射筆完全充電後，應拔走插頭；及
雷射筆所發出的光束有機會損害眼睛和皮膚，在任何情況下都不應將雷射筆的光點射向眼睛。


海關一直致力保障消費者的權益，不時在市場巡查及抽取消費品樣本進行安全測試，以確保消費品達到合理的安全程度。

海關同時提醒商戶，須遵從《消費品安全條例》的規定，以保障消費者安全。根據《消費品安全條例》，任何人士不得供應、製造或進口消費品，除非該等消費品符合《消費品安全條例》的一般安全規定。違例者首次定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁一年，而其後各次定罪則最高可被判罰款五十萬元及監禁兩年。

根據《商品說明條例》，任何人在營商或業務過程中供應已應用虛假商品說明的貨品，或管有已應用虛假商品說明的貨品作出售用途，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五十萬元及監禁五年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑違反上述條例的活動。"
衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-12-08 17:15,2025-12-08 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800668.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月八日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在十一月三十日至十二月六日期間，中心錄得四宗社區感染及一宗輸入的退伍軍人病個案，五名病人均有長期病患。

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-12-08 17:15,2025-12-08 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800669.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (December 8) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From November 30 to December 6, the CHP recorded four community-acquired and one imported LD cases. All five patients had underlying illnesses.

Community-acquired cases
-------------------------------

a 69-year-old male patient living in Eastern District;
a 45-year-old female patient living in Eastern District;
a 90-year-old male patient living in Kowloon City District; and
a 73-year-old male patient living in Kwun Tong District.


Imported case
----------------

a 77-year-old male patient who travelled to the Chinese Mainland during the incubation period.


âThe CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that these are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these five cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of December 6, 156 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.

â
âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

  The two MOUs were signed on the sidelines of the Business of Intellectual Property (BIP) Asia Forum held in Hong Kong with an aim to deepen Hong Kong's co-operation with Cambodia and Malaysia in areas such as the creation, protection, management and commercialisation of IP, and enhance the critical role of IP in driving innovation and creativity, as well as in seizing business opportunities.

  Under the MOUs, Hong Kong and the two places will engage in diverse forms of collaboration, such as fostering the exchange of IP-related information, enhancing personnel training and capacity building, and organising seminars and conferences to boost professional capabilities in IP businesses.

  ""Hong Kong enjoys the distinctive advantage of having strong support from the motherland and being closely connected to the world under the 'one country, two systems' principle. Our business environment is highly market-oriented and internationalised, underpinned by the rule of law, with a robust and effective IP system in place. The IPD looks forward to joining hands with the IP authorities of Cambodia and Malaysia to strengthen co-operation in the field of IP. Sharing a common vision, we are jointly committed to leveraging the IP system to encourage industries to create and innovate, and promote economic development,"" Mr Wong said.

Customs officers intercepted a 31-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (December 7). About 13 900 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $62,000 and a duty potential of about $46,000, were seized from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

  Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you all today at the 2nd International Cerebro-cardiovascular Medical Innovation Summit organised by the Hong Kong Centre for Cerebro-Cardiovascular Health Engineering, COCHE in short.

 Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. Today's Summit provides a vital platform for interdisciplinary exchange and dialogue among world-class experts. We are happy to see the gathering of experts from different disciplines dedicated to addressing critical challenges and advancing medical innovation in cerebro-cardiovascular health - a domain that directly impacts millions of lives worldwide.

 Pursuant to the country's 14th Five-Year Plan and the 15th Five-Year Plan proposal to develop Hong Kong as an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is committed to building a vibrant I&T ecosystem. Amongst our efforts, InnoHK stands out as a flagship I&T initiative that has successfully established a total of 30 research centres in Hong Kong, collaborating with more than 30 world-renowned universities and research institutes from 12 economies, pooling more than 3 000 researchers locally and from all over the world.

  The COCHE, one of the InnoHK centres in the area of life and health sciences and the organiser of this Summit, specialises in developing innovative technologies for the early prediction and intervention of cardiovascular diseases. With strategic partnerships with world-leading institutions including the University of Oxford and the Karolinska Institutet, the Centre has made significant advancements in AI-powered imaging, biosensing, and drug delivery systems by strategic partnership since its establishment in December 2020. This shows us how breakthroughs can be achieved through global research collaboration. Through shared datasets and cross-border clinical validation, the participating institutions integrated the Centre's technical innovation and clinical applications. Besides, students from the University of Oxford visited the COCHE in 2024 with an aim of strengthening academic exchange and cultivating future talent. Such exchanges of talents lay a fertile ground for Hong Kong to develop an international research hub.

 Building on the successes of the first two InnoHK clusters which focus on life and health sciences as well as AI and robotics, we are expediting the establishment of the third InnoHK research cluster which focus on sustainable development, energy, advanced manufacturing, and materials. This cluster aims to drive the development of new industrialisation in Hong Kong and promote the development of advanced technologies and the related industries.

 Ladies and gentlemen, innovation does not happen in isolation. It thrives through collaboration. As we gather here today, let us reaffirm our commitment to working together for the betterment of humanity. With the concerted efforts of the Government, academia, research institutions and industry partners, I am confident that our I&T ecosystem will not only thrive, but also strengthen Hong Kong's competitive edge. May I wish the 2nd ICMIS every success. Thank you."

立法會換屆選舉點票順利完成（附圖）,2025-12-08 09:48,2025-12-08 10:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800285.htm,"下稿代選舉管理委員會發出：

二○二五年立法會換屆選舉的點票工作於今日（十二月八日）清晨約六時順利完成。昨晚（十二月七日）十一時三十分投票結束後，點票工作隨即展開，點算了約1 317 680張地方選區選票、約76 940張功能界別選票，以及1 458張選舉委員會界別選票。

選舉管理委員會（選管會）主席陸啟康法官總結選舉時說：「是次選舉共有1 317 682名選民投票，累積投票率為31.9%。整體而言，投票和點票過程大致暢順，各項選舉安排充分體現公開、誠實和公平的原則，選管會滿意整體安排。」

選管會非常感謝參與選舉工作的決策局／部門，特別是危機管理委員會成員，包括政制及內地事務局、民政及青年事務局、保安局、香港警務處、數字政策辦公室、民政事務總署、政府新聞處、律政司、機電工程署、運輸署和香港天文台提供各方面的全力支援。另外，廉政公署和其他執法機關作出妥善安排，亦令選舉得以順利進行。選管會亦非常感謝技術諮詢委員會就核心選舉系統提供寶貴的專業意見。

是次選舉投票站數目超過600個，投票時間亦延長至16個小時，加上先導安排下多項新的投票安排措施，包括因應一些有特定需要的選民群組，如公務員、醫護人員、少數族裔居民等設立專屬投票站，同時為一些居住於安老院和殘疾人士院舍的選民提供外展投票服務，亦增加了鄰近邊境投票站的數目；在大埔火災後，選舉事務處須在短時間內為區內的三個投票站作出調整，並在政府物流服務署的全力協助，以及在「全政府動員」機制下參與的入境事務處和海關人員，於投票時段內為受影響選民安排免費接駁交通，便利有關選民前往新票站投票。以上安排均為選舉工程帶來一定的挑戰。選管會因此特別多謝選舉事務處及各投票站和點票站工作人員緊守崗位、各司其職，盡全力應付大量的工作。選管會亦感謝各決策局／部門首長為是次選舉提名選舉工作人員，並批准有關人員短暫離開工作崗位，參加選舉事務處安排的培訓及實習演練，令今次選舉暢順有序地舉行。

選管會將按法例規定檢討是次選舉安排，並於三個月內向行政長官提交報告書。

選管會最後感謝所有投票的選民利用手上神聖的一票，選出新一屆立法會；亦感謝傳媒對選舉事務的報道，以及候選人和助選團的合作，使投票和點票在公開、誠實和公平的情況下，安全、有序和高效地進行。"
Counting of votes for Legislative Council General Election completed smoothly (with photos),2025-12-08 09:48,2025-12-08 10:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800286.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Electoral Affairs Commission:

  The counting of votes for the 2025 Legislative Council General Election (LCGE) was completed smoothly at around 6am today (December 8). The poll closed at 11.30pm last night (December 7) and the counting of about 1 317 680 geographical constituency (GC) ballot papers, about 76 940 functional constituency ballot papers and 1 458 Election Committee constituency ballot papers commenced soon afterward.

  ""For the LCGE, about 1 317 682 electors have cast their votes, with a cumulative GC turnout rate of 31.9 per cent. Overall, the polling and counting processes proceeded smoothly and all arrangements for the LCGE have reflected the principle of openness, honesty and fairness. The Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) is satisfied with the arrangements,"" the Chairman of the EAC, Mr Justice David Lok, said on the conclusion of the LCGE.

  The EAC is very thankful to the bureaux/departments (B/Ds) involved in the LCGE, especially the Crisis Management Committee members which include the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, the Security Bureau, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Digital Policy Office, the Home Affairs Department, the Information Services Department, the Department of Justice, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, the Transport Department and the Hong Kong Observatory for their full support in various aspects. In addition, the Independent Commission Against Corruption and other law enforcement agencies have made appropriate arrangements for the smooth conduct of the LCGE. The EAC would also like to thank the Technical Advisory Committee for their valuable professional input to the election-related mission critical systems.

  There were more than 600 polling stations in the LCGE with polling duration extended to 16 hours. Also added in the LCGE were various new electoral work under the pilot arrangements, including introducing Designated Polling Stations for the groups of electors with specific needs such as civil servants, healthcare staff and ethnic minorities residents; providing outreach polling service to electors residing in residential care homes for the elderly and persons with disabilities; as well as increasing the number of Near Boundary Polling Stations. After the fire in Tai Po, the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) needed to make adjustments for three polling stations in the district within a short period of time. With the full assistance by the Government Logistics Department, and the efforts of staff members of the Immigration Department and the Customs and Excise Department under the ""government-wide mobilisation"" mechanism, free feeder transportation services were offered to the affected electors during the polling hours so that they can travel to the reallocated polling stations conveniently to cast their votes. The aforesaid arrangements posed substantial challenges to the whole election process. In this connection, the EAC extends its special thanks to the staff of the REO and the polling and counting staff for their contributions and efforts made in coping with a large amount of work in their respective positions; as well as the heads of various B/Ds for nominating electoral staff for the LCGE, and for approving them to leave their positions briefly to participate in trainings and drills arranged by the REO which enabled the election be held smoothly and orderly.

  As prescribed by the law, the EAC will submit a report on the review of the electoral arrangements of the LCGE to the Chief Executive within three months.

  Last but not least, the EAC would like to thank all electors who have voted for casting their sacred votes and electing the new Legislative Council. The EAC is also thankful to the media for reporting the electoral affairs; and candidates and their agents for their co-operation, so that the polling and counting processes were conducted openly, honestly and fairly, and in a safe, orderly and efficient manner."
