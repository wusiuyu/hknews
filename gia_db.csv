答覆：

主席：

政府非常關注道路安全，包括車輛在行車時須適當盛載或固定負載物的要求。就李世榮議員的提問，經諮詢香港警務處（警務處）、路政署及運輸署後，我現回覆如下：

（一）路政署委聘承辦商每日主動巡查及清掃轄下的快速道路，採用專設的道路清掃車，若發現障礙物包括建築物料等散落路面，承辦商會即時調派人手和設備加快清理。署方除定期審視承辦商的工作紀錄外，亦會實地抽查清掃效果。當接獲公眾投訴或報告後，路政署亦會迅速安排承辦商作即時清理，以減低路面障礙物對道路使用者造成的風險。

路政署為清理快速道路上的障礙物訂立服務承諾，以接獲轉介後1.5小時內到達現場為目標，並即時安排清理工作。過去三年，全部個案均達標。

此外，路政署在道路維護中亦積極應用創新科技，例如利用配備激光掃描設備及全球衞星定位技術的檢測車迅速識別路面坑洞及其他潛在缺陷，以全面掌握路面狀況及準確制定維修次序，提升安全及維修效率。

（二）根據《道路交通（交通管制）規例》（第374G章），司機須確保負載物適當地固定或盛載在車輛上，不可對任何人士造成危險。警務處負責就此執法，初犯者最高可處罰款五千元及監禁三個月。如多次被定罪，則最高可處罰款一萬元及監禁六個月。此外，運輸署亦根據政府隧道及管制區的規例於相關範圍內就未有穩妥固定負載物的車輛執法，違者最高可處罰款五千元及監禁六個月。

最近三年，各部門持續加強執法，而檢控數字有所下降，顯示執法和罰則有效。我們會繼續密切留意情況，適時檢視法例。此外，警務處亦持續監察嚴重及致命交通意外的數據，展開全港性專題執法行動，包括特別留意貨車的違規情況，例如剛於今年九月進行「打擊貨車違例行為」行動，以提升整體道路安全水平。

相關部門亦積極探索應用新科技，提升執法效率和道路安全。最近，警務處首次在非市區路段試驗使用無人機作交通錄影執法，打擊危險駕駛行為。警務處將會檢討成效，考慮擴展至其他地區或違例項目的可行性，例如負載物不穩固及超載等。

（三）現時政府隧道及管制區設有熱線電話，讓市民向營辦商報告事故。運輸署一直密切監察營辦商的表現，並定時監察熱線的運作情況。

就早前有市民表示於本年九月十五日至十六日上午未能成功以熱線聯絡大欖隧道營辦商一事，營辦商已向運輸署提交報告，指事發時電話對話錄音裝置的轉駁機制失靈，導致外部來電無法轉駁至隧道人員接聽。經緊急維修，系統已於九月十六日回復正常。由於營辦商未能及時接聽熱線，署方已責成營辦商必須加強隧道緊急事故的準備及應變，確保系統運作暢順。

我們認為營辦商未能有效營運24小時熱線的情況絕不理想，運輸署已按合約向營辦商發出失責通知書追究責任，營辦商已按合約要求作出賠償。署方會繼續嚴肅跟進事件，並加強監察熱線的運作情況。

現時市民可透過多個途徑向政府部門反映道路狀況。此外，運輸署計劃在更換隧道及管制區的交通管制及監察系統時，引入人工智能閉路電視偵測路面障礙物和路面事故，優化事故管理。

運輸署一直透過不同渠道進行宣傳和教育，提高貨車業界對載貨安全的意識。例如，根據法例制訂《車輛載貨守則》，就載貨安全提供指引；出版《貨車運輸通訊》和與貨車業界舉行定期會議；在交通燈控制器和隧道區內可變信息顯示屏發放提示信息。運輸署及警務處會繼續聯同道路安全議會進行宣傳教育，包括出版和派發《道路安全通訊》及透過社交媒體平台發放資訊等，加強道路使用者的安全意識。

多謝主席。"
LCQ4: Clearing obstructions which pose hazards to road safety,2025-10-15 14:38,2025-10-15 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500430.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Stanley Li and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

  Two incidents occurred respectively last month, including a case in which a bus driver was injured while driving by a metal rod propelled into the air from the road surface after being run over by vehicles, and another where a bus was struck by road debris on its windscreen. These incidents have aroused grave public concern about the risks posed by obstructions on road surface to road users. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1)whether it will take measures to step up clearance of obstructions on highways, such as by increasing inspection frequency, installing additional closed-circuit televisions along the roads, improving clearance procedures, etc, so as to effectively ensure the safety of all road users; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2)whether the Government will review the existing legislation to impose additional fines and other heavier penalties on behaviours concerning depositing or leaving objects on carriageways which may pose hazards to road safety, with a view to enhancing the deterrent effect; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3)whether it will review the existing mechanism for members of the public to report road obstructions, establish more convenient channels for reporting potential road safety hazards, such as by setting up dedicated hotlines and online platforms, etc, and step up road safety publicity and education efforts to encourage members of the public to proactively report potential road safety hazards and remove them under safe circumstances, thereby jointly preventing the recurrence of related accidents; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The Government has consistently placed great importance on road safety and the requirement for moving vehicles to properly contain or secure their loads. Having consulted the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), the Highways Department (HyD) and the Transport Department (TD), my response to the question raised by the Hon Stanley Li is as follows:

(1)The HyD engages contractors to carry out daily proactive inspections and cleaning of expressways under its purview using specialised road sweepers. Should any obstacles, including construction materials etc, be found scattered on the road surface, contractors will immediately dispatch personnel and equipment to expedite the clearance. In addition to regularly reviewing contractors' work records, the HyD also conducts on-site spot checks to evaluate the effectiveness of cleaning efforts. Upon receiving public complaints or reports, the HyD will also promptly arrange for contractors to conduct immediate cleaning to minimise the risks posed by road obstacles to road users.

  The HyD has established a performance pledge for clearing obstacles on expressways, targeting to arrive at the scene within 1.5 hours of receiving a referral and immediately arrange for clearance work. All cases over the past three years have met this target.

  Additionally, the HyD actively applies innovative technologies in the maintenance of carriageways. For example, inspection vehicles equipped with laser scanning devices and global satellite positioning technology are deployed to swiftly identify potholes and other potential defects on road surfaces. This enables a comprehensive understanding of road conditions and allows for the precise prioritisation of repair works, thereby enhancing safety and maintenance efficiency.

(2)Under the Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations (Cap. 374G), the driver shall ensure that any load is properly secured to or contained inside the vehicle and that its weight and manner in which it is placed in the vehicle shall not cause danger to any person. The HKPF is responsible for law enforcement against related contraventions. Any driver who contravenes the relevant regulation is liable to a maximum fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for three months on first conviction; and to a maximum fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for six months on subsequent convictions. Moreover, the TD also takes enforcement actions against vehicles failing to properly secure their loads in the area of government tunnels and control areas pursuant to the relevant regulations. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for six months.

  Over the past three years, all departments have consistently strengthened enforcement efforts. Prosecution figures have declined which indicates that enforcement and penalties are effective. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and review the law as appropriate. Moreover, the HKPF continuously monitors data on serious and fatal traffic accidents and conducts territory-wide enforcement operations in response, particularly targeting non-compliance by lorries. These include the ""Crackdown on Lorry Offences"" operation conducted in September this year, with the aim of enhancing overall road safety.

  Relevant departments are proactively exploring the use of new technologies to enhance the enforcement efficiency and strengthen road safety. Recently, the HKPF conducted the first trial of drone-assisted traffic enforcement on non-urban road sections to combat dangerous driving. The HKPF will review the effectiveness of the trial and consider the feasibility of extending the initiative to other areas or offence types, including insecure vehicle loads and overloading.

(3)Currently, the operators of government tunnels and control areas provide hotlines for members of the public to report incidents. The TD has been closely monitoring the performance of the operators and the operation of their hotlines regularly.

  Regarding the incident that members of the public were unable to contact the operator of Tai Lam Tunnel via the hotline from September 15 to the morning of September 16, 2025, the operator has submitted a report to the TD. The report indicates that at the time of the incident, the call transfer mechanism of the telephone conversation recording device malfunctioned, preventing external calls from being transferred to tunnel staff for answering. Following emergency repairs, the system resumed normal on September 16. Due to the operator's failure to promptly respond to the hotline, the TD has instructed them to strengthen their preparedness and contingency measures for tunnel emergencies to ensure the smooth operation of the systems.

  We consider the operator's failure to maintain effective 24-hour hotline operations unacceptable. The TD has issued a Notice of Default to the operator in accordance with the contract to pursue its liability, and the operator has provided compensation as contractually required. The Department will continue to follow up on this matter seriously and enhance monitoring of the hotline operations.

  Members of the public may report road conditions to government departments through multiple channels at present. To enhance incident management, the TD plans to introduce AI-based closed-circuit television systems for detecting road obstructions and incidents when replacing the traffic control and surveillance systems in tunnels and controlled areas.

  The TD has been conducting publicity and educational activities through various channels to enhance the goods vehicle trade's awareness of safe loading. For example, a Code of Practice for the Loading of Vehicles is compiled in accordance with the law, which provides guidelines on safe loading. The TD also issues the Goods Vehicle Trade Newsletter and holds regular meetings with the goods vehicle trade. Reminder messages are affixed on traffic signal controllers and displayed on variable message signs in tunnel areas. The TD and the HKPF will continue to work with the Road Safety Council to conduct publicity and educational programmes, such as publishing and distributing the Road Safety Bulletin, and disseminating information through social media platforms, to enhance road users' awareness of safety.

  Thank you, President."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-10-15 14:36,2025-10-15 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500535.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 15) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

LC: Speech by CS in presenting Government Minute in response to Annual Report of The Ombudsman 2024/25,2025-10-15 14:35,2025-10-15 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500521.htm,"Following is the speech (translated from Chinese) by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, in presenting the Government Minute in response to the Annual Report of The Ombudsman 2024/25 in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Mr President,

On July 2 this year, I submitted the Annual Report of The Ombudsman 2024/25 to the Legislative Council. Today, I submit the Government Minute (GM) to comprehensively respond to the recommendations as set out in the Annual Report.

The Government attaches importance to the practical, constructive, and actionable recommendations made by the Office of The Ombudsman (the Office) concerning the provision of public services, with a view to further promoting an efficient and citizen-oriented public administration. In the year 2024-25, the Office concluded 40 complaint cases by full investigations and completed eight direct investigations, making a total of 254 recommendations - a record high number in recent years. All relevant government bureaux, departments and public bodies have seriously examined the Office's reports and accepted all recommendations, reflecting the current-term Government's commitment to enhancing the management and efficacy of public services. Departments concerned have either implemented or are actively pursuing the follow-up actions to the Office's recommendations. Detailed responses are set out in the GM.

In addition, in recent years the Office has actively used mediation to handle complaints which do not involve or only involve minor maladministration, with a view to resolving issues in a non-adversarial manner and achieving win-win for all parties concerned. All relevant government bureaux, departments and public bodies have also fully supported and cooperated with the Office's mediation efforts. In 2024-25, the Office handled 555 cases through mediation - a threefold increase as compared with the previous year, and mediations were typically completed within just one day or a few days. The Government will continue to collaborate with the Office to promote mediation, aiming to expedite the assistance rendered to the public in resolving complaints.

To recognise government bureaux, departments and public officers' outstanding performance in complaint handling and public service delivery, the Office held The Ombudsman's Awards Presentation Ceremony in October 2024, presenting awards to six departments and organisations and 79 public officers.

We understand the community's rising expectations on public service delivery. In May this year, I met with The Ombudsman to discuss on strengthening the systems on departmental management and performance accountability. In this year's Policy Address, the Chief Executive announced the establishment of the Heads of Department Accountability System with a view to continuously strengthening departmental performance through institutionalised and systematic management, thereby fostering a culture of continuous improvement and boost public confidence.

Mr President, I wish to express my sincere gratitude to The Ombudsman and his professional team for their independent, objective and fair work in their investigations and mediation efforts, which provided support for the effective governance of the Government. A robust monitoring mechanism is the cornerstone of social progress; the work of the Office and government administration are complementary to each other. The Government will, as always, fully support the work of the Office and continue to provide efficient, quality and people-oriented public services to the citizens.

Thank you, Mr President."

It aptly showcased the professionalism and active engagement of the judicial and legal sectors from across the Strait, Hong Kong and Macao. The event will continue to serve as an important platform for fostering judicial co-operation, exchange, and mutual learning among participating jurisdictions."
Civil servants receive vaccines against influenza (with photos),2025-10-15 14:18,2025-10-15 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500330.htm,"  With a view to facilitating and encouraging civil servants in receiving influenza vaccinations, the Civil Service Bureau and the Department of Health continue to implement the Civil Service Eligible Persons (CSEPs) Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Pilot Scheme this year. For the first time, outreach vaccination services are being conducted at specified government offices on a pilot basis. About 110 CSEPs received influenza vaccines at the outreach station at the Central Government Offices (CGO) this morning (October 15).

  The Secretary for the Civil Service, Mrs Ingrid Yeung, and the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, spoke with civil servants receiving the influenza vaccines to listen to their views. The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, and the Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, also received their vaccines at the outreach station.

  Mrs Yeung said, ""It is better to receive the influenza vaccine sooner rather than later. As civil servants frequently interact with the public, being vaccinated can better protect their health and the health of the members of the public they serve, reduce the risk of workplace and community transmission of influenza, and minimise the impact on the delivery of public services due to illnesses in the civil service. I encourage more civil service colleagues to receive their vaccinations early, and I am pleased with the good response from colleagues today. The outreach vaccination service is efficient and convenient, allowing colleagues to complete their vaccinations with only a brief absence from work.""

  The CSEPs Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Pilot Scheme in 2025/26 has commenced and is open to all CSEPs aged 6 months or above. Those who have made an appointment can receive free seasonal influenza vaccines at families clinics. For details, please visit www.csb.gov.hk/english/admin/benefits/66.html.

  In addition, this year's pilot scheme provides vaccination services by appointment through the outreach stations, on a pilot basis, at specified government offices (the CGO, the Queensway Government Offices, the West Kowloon Government Offices, and the North Point Government Offices) on several dates between mid-October and November."

LCQ5: Preventing abuse of talent admission schemes,2025-10-15 13:56,2025-10-15 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500292.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Hoey Simon Lee and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

 It is reported that some individuals come to Hong Kong under the talent admission schemes but leave after giving birth to their children, with the sole purpose of obtaining the Hong Kong permanent resident status for their children, rather than a true intention to pursue their career in Hong Kong. There are views pointing out that such practice not only goes against the original intent of the talent policy, but also creates uncertainty to resource planning of various social services in Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether there is any mechanism under the current talent policy to prevent situations where individuals come to Hong Kong under the guise of career development but actually just to give birth;

(2) to avoid the recurrence of a large number of doubly non-permanent resident children (i.e. children born in Hong Kong but whose parents are non-permanent residents of Hong Kong), whether the Government has considered establishing a mechanism requiring talent coming to Hong Kong and their dependants to sign a declaration confirming their intention to remain in Hong Kong for career development when making delivery bookings at public or private medical institutions in Hong Kong, or requiring them to submit supporting documents (such as proof of employment in Hong Kong or immigration records) to confirm that they have met the requirement of staying in Hong Kong for a certain number of days; and

(3) whether it has assessed the impact of the talent admission schemes on Hong Kong's long-term population scale and structure, with a view to precisely controlling the allocation of resources for public services such as social welfare, housing, healthcare and education?

Reply:

President,

 As an international talent hub, Hong Kong has been welcoming outside talent to come to the city for development, thereby enriching the local talent pool. To address the challenges posed by an ageing population and manpower shortage, the current-term Government has since end-2022 implemented a series of measures to trawl for talent. These include the launch of the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) targeting talent with high income and academic qualifications, as well as enhancement of the various existing schemes. To date, more than 240000 global elites from diverse backgrounds have been attracted to come to Hong Kong for development. Among others, the TTPS has received enthusiastic responses, with over 90000 talents having arrived in Hong Kong. Among the first batch of TTPS entrants whose visas have expired, more than half successfully secured extension of stay. Most of them have joined key industries and earn competitive salaries, demonstrating strong market competitiveness. In the World Talent Ranking 2025 published recently by the International Institute for Management Development, Hong Kong's ranking leapt markedly to fourth globally, marking the highest-ever ranking topping Asia. This is clear evidence that the talent attraction policies are in the right direction with effective outcomes.

 Nevertheless, after the talents have been successfully attracted to come to Hong Kong, the greater challenge lies in retaining them. In addition to continuing the efforts in boosting the economy and the growth of emerging industries to provide a favourable environment for the development of local and overseas talent, the Government is committed to providing the necessary support for talent, encouraging them to settle down and contribute to Hong Kong's development.

 In consultation with the Health Bureau (HHB), Housing Bureau (HB), Education Bureau (EDB), Immigration Department (ImmD) and Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), my reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) As mentioned earlier, in the global competition for talent, our real challenge lies in how to retain them.

 The majority of talents admitted to Hong Kong under the various admission schemes are very young, with 70 per cent under the age of 40. In particular, nearly all admitted under Category C of the TTPS are aged 30 or below. They are at critical stages in their careers and also within the prime age range for starting families. The Government's follow-up surveys have revealed that family considerations, such as arrangements for children's education, are among the top priorities for incoming talent when making a relocation decision. This reflects that talent retention is not only driven by career opportunities but also has to take into account the overall needs of their families. More comprehensive support should be offered to strengthen the sense of belonging of talent and their families to Hong Kong.

 Outside talents is a vital driving force for our economic development. Taking the TTPS as an example, the entrants are estimated to contribute directly to Hong Kong's economy by an amount of some HK$34 billion per annum, which is equivalent to about 1.2 per cent of the local Gross Domestic Product. We hope to regard these talents as part of our community, and therefore must address their family needs just as we do for other Hong Kong residents, so as to help them live and work in contentment in the city.

 The current dependant policy allows talent to bring their spouses and minor children to reside in Hong Kong. We also welcome them to start families and give birth to children in Hong Kong so as to establish roots in the city. These new additions to our population are and will continue to be an important source of the local labour force, which would help improve the demographic structure and alleviate the challenges posed by the local ageing population and the low birth rate, providing long-term manpower support for Hong Kong's sustainable development.

 I must emphasise that the various talent admission schemes with different positionings all have clear eligibility criteria and vetting procedures. Under current laws, anyone who furnishes false information or makes false representation to the ImmD are liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and imprisonment for 14 years. The ImmD has a rigorous and effective mechanism in place for assessing each application under the talent admission schemes in a rigorous manner. This is to ensure that only applicants meeting the relevant eligibility criteria and immigration policies will be admitted into Hong Kong for stay. The approved applicants are all talents with competitiveness that Hong Kong aims to attract. Based on our observations, talent who have not yet secured employment are genuinely interested in pursuing long-term development in Hong Kong. We are not aware of anyone coming to Hong Kong under the guise of career development just to give birth.

 The Government understands the public expectation about proper use of limited public resources. At present, the incoming talent represents only a small fraction of Hong Kong's overall population, and have not put pressure on local resources. The HHB has no plan at the moment to impose different restrictions or requirements on maternity service bookings based on the route through which individuals obtain their Hong Kong residency. However, the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) will continue to keep in view the settlement of incoming talents in Hong Kong, including collecting data on talent's childbirth, to facilitate better resource planning by relevant policy bureaux. If any abuse of the talent admission schemes is detected, the Government will take appropriate action.

(3) To provide the basis for the Government's planning in various policy areas and resource allocation, the C&SD and the LWB regularly compile updated population and manpower projection respectively to understand the trend of change in Hong Kong's population and manpower needs during the projection period. Currently, these two sets of projections have taken into account the impact of the major talent admission schemes. The next population census is scheduled to be conducted in 2026, and the LWB is now conducting a mid-term update on the manpower projection, with the results expected to be released in the fourth quarter of 2026.

 The various policy bureaux will continuously review the implementation and effectiveness of the measures under their respective purviews in response to the latest demographic and manpower trends. For instance, the HB will continue to closely monitor the supply and demand of different types of housing and adjust the corresponding policies in a timely manner where necessary. The HHB will continue to deepen the reform of the healthcare system to ensure the viability of Hong Kong's healthcare system. The EDB will review education policies from time to time, with a view to meeting the needs of the society."
立法會五題：防止濫用人才入境計劃,2025-10-15 13:56,2025-10-15 14:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500266.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上李浩然議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的答覆：

問題：

據報有部分人士透過人才入境計劃來港產子後便離開，其目的只為了讓子女取得香港永久性居民身份，而非真正有意來港發展。有意見指出，有關做法不但有違人才政策原意，更為本港各項社會服務的資源規劃帶來不確定性。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）在現行人才政策下，有否機制防止「以來港發展為名，產子為實」的情況；

（二）為避免大量雙非兒童（即父母均非香港永久性居民但在香港出生）的情況重現，政府有否考慮設立機制，要求來港人才及其受養人在本港公私營醫療機構預約分娩時，須簽署聲明文件確認其留港發展意向，或要求其提交證明文件（例如在港的工作證明或出入境紀錄），以確定其已達到一定的留港日數要求；及

（三）有否評估人才入境計劃對香港長遠人口規模及結構的影響，以精準調控社會福利、住屋、醫療、教育等公共服務的資源分配？

答覆：

主席：

作為國際人才樞紐，香港一直歡迎外來人才來港發展，藉以豐富本地人才庫。為應對人口高齡化及人力短缺的挑戰，本屆政府自二○二二年底推出了一系列「搶人才」措施，包括推行以高薪和高學歷人士為目標的高端人才通行證計劃（高才通計劃），以及優化多項現有計劃，至今已吸引超過24萬不同界別的全球精英來港發展。其中，高才通計劃反應踴躍，超過九萬人已經來港，而首批簽證到期的高才有逾半成功續簽，大多投身關鍵產業，收入可觀，展現強大市場競爭力。香港在國際管理發展學院最近發布的《2025年世界人才排名》中躍升至歷來最高的第四位，成為亞洲之冠，足見人才政策路向正確且已見成效。

然而，成功吸引人才來港之後，如何「留人才」才是最大挑戰。政府除會繼續大力發展經濟及新興產業，提供有利環境讓本地及海外人才發展外，亦致力為人才提供所需支援，鼓勵他們落地生根，為香港發展作出貢獻。

就議員的提問，經諮詢醫務衞生局（醫衞局）、房屋局、教育局、入境事務處（入境處）和政府統計處（統計處）後，現答覆如下：

（一）及（二）正如我剛才提及，在全球人才競奪戰中，如何「留人才」是我們面對的挑戰。

經不同入境計劃來港的人才大部分都很年輕，七成在40歲以下，其中高才通計劃C類人才更幾乎全數在30歲或以下，他們正值事業打拼期，亦處於組建家庭的黃金年齡。政府的跟進調查顯示，來港人才考慮移居時其中一項非常重視的就是家庭因素，包括子女教育安排等。這反映「留人才」除發展機遇外，亦須兼顧人才家庭的整體需要，提供更全面的配套，加強人才及其家庭對香港的歸屬感。

外來人才是推動經濟發展的重要力量之一，以高才通計劃為例，估計可為香港帶來每年約340億元的直接經濟貢獻，相當於本地生產總值約1.2%。我們希望視這些人才為香港的一分子，因而須照顧他們跟其他香港市民一樣的家庭需要，以促進他們在港安居樂業。

現行受養人政策已容許人才攜同配偶及未成年子女來港生活，我們亦歡迎人才在港成家生育，扎根香港。這些新力軍現在及日後都是本地勞動力的重要來源，有助改善人口結構，緩解本地人口老化和生育率偏低的結構問題，為香港的可持續發展提供長期的人力支撐。

我必須強調，各項不同定位的人才入境計劃均設有清晰的申請資格與審批程序。現時法例下，任何人向入境處作出虛假申述或申報失實資料，一經定罪最高可被判罰款15萬及監禁14年。入境處設有嚴謹有效的機制，就人才入境計劃的每宗申請進行嚴格審批，以確保只有符合獲批資格及相關入境政策的人士才獲准在港居留。申請獲批的都是香港希望吸納、具競爭力的人才。據我們觀察，仍未獲聘的人才都有興趣在港長遠發展，並未發現有人所謂「以來港發展為名，產子為實」的情況。

政府明白社會期望有限的公共資源用得其所。現時來港人才只佔香港整體人口很低比例，並無對本地資源構成壓力。醫衞局現時並無計劃因應市民獲得香港居民身分的途徑而就預約分娩服務實施不同的限制或要求。不過，勞工及福利局（勞褔局）會持續留意來港人才的落戶情況，包括蒐集有關人才在港生育的數據，以便相關政策局作出更完善的資源規劃。如發現有濫用人才入境計劃的情況，政府會採取適當措施。

（三）統計處和勞褔局會分別定期編製最新人口和人力推算，以掌握推算期內香港人口和人力需求的變化趨勢，從而為政府在不同政策及資源分配上的規劃提供基礎。現時兩項推算均會考慮主要人才入境計劃的影響。下輪人口普查將於二○二六年進行，而勞褔局亦正開展人力推算的中期更新工作，預計在二○二六年第四季公布結果。

各政策局會因應人口變化及人力資源最新趨勢，持續檢視所負責措施的執行情況及成效，例如：房屋局會密切留意各類房屋的供求情況，並按需要適時調整相應政策；醫衞局會繼續深化醫療體系改革，確保香港醫療體系行穩致遠；教育局會不時檢視教育政策，切合社會需要。"
立法會一題：推動北部都會區發展的措施,2025-10-15 13:06,2025-10-15 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500403.htm,"​以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上林健鋒議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的答覆：

問題：

今年的《施政報告》提出加快發展北部都會區（北都）。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府表示會以包括「片區開發」等多元開發模式推動市場參與以加速北都發展，並擬在今年第四季及明年分別推出洪水橋，以及粉嶺北新發展區和新田科技城的「片區」試點，該三個片區的具體招標程序為何，以及何時公布相關時間表；

（二）據報政府計劃以「雙信封制」就北都部分土地項目進行招標，以便在評審過程中可同時考慮投標企業所帶來的技術、經濟和稅收貢獻等因素，有關招標的具體評分準則（包括技術與價格的各佔比重）為何；政府將如何確保評審過程公開透明；及

（三）北都的河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區的最新招租情況為何，包括目前已簽署租約的企業數目，以及首批租户預計開始營運的日期；當局有何進一步的配套及優惠措施吸引高端科創企業進駐園區？

答覆：

主席：

北部都會區（北都）是引領香港未來發展、推動產業轉型的重要引擎，也是香港與大灣區其他城市聯動發展的新平台，提升香港作為連接內地與國際的關鍵樞紐地位。由於北都幅員廣闊，投資龐大，香港特別行政區政府會採用創新及多元的發展模式，善用政府和市場資源推展計劃。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢創新科技及工業局後，我回覆如下：

（一）在「片區開發」模式下，投得項目的發展商會綜合開發較大規模的地塊，當中包括具商業價值的住宅和產業用地，以及公共設施用地。政府已提出三個「片區」試點，分別位於洪水橋／厦村新發展區（洪水橋）、粉嶺北新發展區和新田科技城。早前完成的市場意向徵集共收到22份意向書，有助我們敲定招標條款前了解市場看法。

我們計劃先為洪水橋「片區」於今年年底進行招標，而另外兩個「片區」則計劃於明年陸續推出。我們正因應市場意見，調整洪水橋「片區」的相關安排和要求，包括將私營房屋住宅用地由兩幅增至三幅，以及取消要求投標者興建一條主要道路以減少建設公共設施的要求，增加項目的盈利能力。「片區」內有三幅企業及科技園用地，原本我們只要求成功投得片區的企業發展和營運其中一幅，其餘兩幅只需完成土地平整後交還政府。我們正考慮在標書提供選項，讓願意參與建設片區內更多產業用地的投標者，在「雙信封制」的招標模式下為此額外承擔而獲得分數。另外，我們正考慮提供較長的建築規約，以及較有彈性的地價繳付安排，包括分期支付。我們年底招標時會公布最終安排。

（二）我們將靈活批撥北都內的土地，推動企業落戶和投資。如果是採用招標方式，可因應情況考慮是否單純看投標者出價，或採用「雙信封制」方式進行招標。最近創新科技及工業局推出的沙嶺數據園區用地，便採用了「雙信封制」招標模式，洪水橋「片區」亦傾向採用這種模式招標。採用「雙信封制」招標，將綜合考慮非價格和價格建議，並按個別情況制訂評審的比重和元素。以沙嶺的招標作為例子，非價格建議和價格建議的比重分別為百分之七十和百分之三十，非價格建議會評審投標者在投資和發展產業方面為香港帶來的貢獻，例如聘用人數、投資規模和啓用時間。為確保招標工作公開透明，評審準則會詳列於招標文件，讓投標者清楚理解項目要求和評分準則。政府會成立由相關政策局和部門組成的標書評審委員會，根據《物料供應及採購規例》客觀專業地評審標書。評審結果會提交予財經事務及庫務局轄下的中央投標委員會作審批。

（三）河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區（河套香港園區）第一期首三座大樓已落成。港深創新及科技園有限公司（港深創科園公司）正積極推進相關的招租工作，現時已經與近30家分別來自內地、香港及國際的企業、大學及研究機構就進駐河套香港園區深入磋商，其中相當部分已簽署租約，預計首批涵蓋生命健康科技、微電子、新能源及人工智能等支柱產業的租戶將於今年年底前正式投入營運。港深創科園公司的招租工作正持續進行中，簽署租約的企業和機構將會陸續有所增加。

港深創科園公司會提供相應的配套設施，例如人才公寓、商業及其他附屬設施，支援進駐企業及機構的營運。同時，公司正積極籌備在二○二五至二六年度內展開「河套港深創新及科技園培育計劃」，為初創團隊和企業提供資助和支援服務，發揮「以產聚才」的作用。此外，政府正探討透過籌備中的北都專屬法例為管理指定地區提供跨境流動的便捷方法，包括人流、數據流和物資流等，財政司司長亦領導政策局制訂優惠政策包，涵蓋批地、地價、資助或稅務減免優惠等，這些策略措施均有助吸引科研及高端製造業落戶香港包括河套香港園區。"

（七）教育局就設計建國歷史體驗行程的工作預計所需的時間及人手為何；預計何時可讓學校報名參與該等建國歷史體驗行程？

答覆：

主席：

國民教育一直是學校課程的宗旨之一，是學校教育不可或缺的部分。國民教育已經融入愛國主義教育的元素和精神。國史、國情、中華文化、國家地理、《憲法》和《基本法》教育、國旗、國歌、國徽等國家象徵和標誌、國家安全等與《中華人民共和國愛國主義教育法》相對接的重要內容，已納入香港中小學各學習領域和相關科目，以及幼稚園課程中，並與價值觀教育及全方位學習活動等互相緊扣，構成學生的重要學習經歷。

教育局持續透過「多重進路 、互相配合」的方式把愛國主義教育融入學校教育，包括優化課程、發展學與教資源、提供教師培訓、舉辦多元化的全方位學習活動（如課外實踐活動、內地考察），以及為學校提供資源和津貼等，以期能全覆蓋、全方位、跨學科及跨學段地支援學校將愛國主義教育融入日常學與教之中，加深學生對國家的認識，建立國家觀念，增強民族意識與愛國情懷。

就吳永嘉議員的提問，教育局回覆如下：

（四）優質教育基金（基金）於二○二一年十一月中旬推出「我的行動承諾」加強版撥款計劃，旨在支援學校推廣國民教育、國家安全教育，以及媒體與資訊素養教育。按校本需要，公帑資助的中、小學（包括特殊學校）可向基金申請一項不超過30萬元的撥款計劃；已參加幼稚園教育計劃的幼稚園則可申請一項不超過15萬元的撥款。自計劃推出以來，約880所學校遞交計劃申請，並獲批撥款。一般而言，個別學校在推行項目時所需的額外資源存在差異，撥款金額乃根據個別申請內容而定，故平均撥款金額並未能充分反映計劃的實際情況。

（五）教育局已於二○二五年五月及七月公布更新版《香港國家安全教育課程框架》（《課程框架》）和27個科目的國家安全教育課程框架，涵蓋八個學習領域和公民與社會發展科，讓國家安全教育與時並進，為教師提供更清晰和全面的指引，幫助學校在已有的良好基礎上，進一步推動國家安全教育。

教育局於《課程框架》發布後四個月內，於八場簡介會向辦學團體代表、校監、校長及教師等持份者介紹《課程框架》的主要更新內容與重點，並說明各學習領域如何結合國家安全教育元素。教育局亦將於二○二五／二六學年提供不少於1 000個國家安全教育教師培訓名額，培訓課程包括實體及網上課程、考察、經驗分享會，以及學習圈等，提升教師的專業能力，以有效落實國家安全教育。

（六）今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年，在中央政府的支持下，坐落北京盧溝橋側的中國人民抗日戰爭紀念館已在今年八月二十一日正式設立為首個港澳青少年愛國主義教育基地 。

香港特別行政區（特區）政府會繼續推廣內地的愛國主義教育設施，並將其納入特區愛國主義教育基地，鼓勵更多香港學生和青年到訪，讓他們全面認識國家的歷史與發展成就。

（七）教育局於二○二五／二六學年設計的建國歷史體驗行程由二○二五年十月起陸續出發，並適時讓學校報名參與，如「『薪火相傳』平台系列：貴州歷史人文與民族生活探索之旅」，學生將到訪貴州長征文化數位藝術館，學習長征重要歷史事件，感受紅軍長征的艱難險阻和領悟長征精神。有關活動所需的人力資源已納入教育局的經常開支內。"

(7) of the estimated time and manpower required by the EDB to design itineraries for students to experience the founding history of our country; the expected timeline to make these itineraries available for schools to register for participation?

Reply:

President,

  National education has been one of the goals of the school curriculum and an indispensable part of school education. National education has already incorporated elements and spirit of patriotic education. Key contents which dovetail with the Patriotic Education Law of People's Republic of China, including Chinese history, national affairs, Chinese culture, national geography, Constitution and Basic Law education, national symbols and signs (such as the national flag, national anthem and national emblem), and national security, have been embedded in various Key Learning Areas (KLAs) and relevant subjects at the primary and secondary levels as well as the curriculum of kindergartens, and are closely intertwined with values education and life-wide learning activities to provide essential learning experiences for students.

  The Education Bureau (EDB) continues to adopt a multi-pronged and co-ordinated approach to integrate patriotic education into school education, such as optimising the curriculum, developing learning and teaching resources, offering training to teachers, organising diversified life-wide learning activities (covering out-of-classroom practical activities, Mainland study tours, etc.), and providing resources and grants for schools, with a view to providing comprehensive, all-round, interdisciplinary and cross-key stage support for schools to integrate patriotic education into daily learning and teaching, as well as helping students deepen their understanding of our country, develop a sense of national identity and enhance their national awareness and national spirit.

  The reply to the question raised by the Hon Jimmy Ng is as follows:

(1) and (2) The 2024 Policy Address puts forward a series of indicators on promoting patriotic education on and off campus. The target has been met for seven of the initiatives in the 2024/25 school year. The remaining initiative, scheduled for implementation over a period of three school years from 2024/25 to 2026/27, has also made satisfactory progress in the 2024/25 school year. Details are as follows:


Interâschool national education activities: The ""Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country 3.0"" series of interâschool national education activities were successfully held with an attendance exceeding 50 000, far higher than expected.
National geography: The EDB has completed the trial teaching scheme and developed the National Geography Resource Portal, and will continue to develop learning and teaching resources on national geography for reference and use by schools.
Focus inspections on national education: Focus inspections on national education were conducted in at least 50 schools to enhance the quality and effectiveness of national education.
Mainland exchange programmes and study tours: Starting from the 2024/25 school year, at least 30 routes with ""red resources"" have been provided for participation by students.
Activities for kindergarten parents: Starting from the 2024/25 school year, all kindergartens joining the Kindergarten Education Scheme (KES) are required to organise one or more activities relating to national education for parents each year.
Training for senior secondary Chinese History teachers: Provided more than 1 000 training places in the 2024/25 school year and will continue to provide such training in the new school year.
Implementation of the Primary Humanities curriculum: The EDB completed the review of the textbooks for Primary One and Primary Four, provided over 9 900 training places, and continued to provide learning and teaching resources. The subject of Primary Humanities has been implemented starting from the 2025/26 school year.
The remaining indicator for implementation over a period of three school years has been launched and taken forward as scheduled. The EDB has planned to provide training places for about 1 000 junior secondary Chinese History teachers who are not History majors within three years starting from the 2024/25 school year. In the 2024/25 school year, some 400 teachers attended the training sessions. Training places will continue to be offered in the new school year to support teachers in completing systematic training.


  Building on the outcomes achieved last year, the 2025 Policy Address further sets the following indicators (including new indicators):


Regularise and popularise the ""Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country"" series of activities starting from the 2025/26 school year and strive to foster patriotic education in schools through collaboration across school sponsoring bodies and among schools to further enhance students' national identity and cultural confidence, with a target annual attendance of no less than 30 000.
Continue to conduct focus inspections on national education in at least 50 schools in the 2025/26 school year to enhance the quality and effectiveness of national education.
Provide no less than 40 itineraries for students to experience the founding history of our country through Mainland exchange programmes and study tours starting from the 2025/26 school year.
Organise various activities on national education for participation by students in the 2025/26 school year, with an expected attendance of no less than 200 000.
Continue to provide training places for junior secondary Chinese History teachers who are not History majors in the 2025/26 school year (over a period of three years).
Provide 1 500 teacher training places and continue to provide learning and teaching resources for the optimised senior secondary Chinese History and History curricula in the 2026/27 school year.


(3) Starting from the 2023/24 school year, all newly-appointed teachers in public sector schools, Direct Subsidy Scheme schools and kindergartens joining the KES (including newly-joined teachers and teachers changing schools) are required to pass the Basic Law and National Security Law Test (BLNST) in order to be considered for appointment. From the 2022/23 to 2024/25 school years, the EDB conducted a total of 16 rounds of BLNST for degree holders and non-degree holders involving about 72 600 applicants in total, including serving teachers, those aspiring to join the teaching profession and prospective graduates. A total of about 55 570 candidates sat for the BLNST, and the passing rate was over 90 per cent.

(4) To support schools in promoting national education, national security education, as well as media and information literacy education, the Quality Education Fund (QEF) launched the enhanced ""My Pledge to Act"" funding programme in mid-November 2021. According to the school-based needs, publicly-funded primary and secondary schools (including special schools) may submit an application to the QEF for funding not exceeding $300,000; kindergartens joining the KES may submit an application for funding not exceeding $150,000. Since the launch of the programme, about 880 schools have submitted their applications with funding approved. Generally speaking, as the additional resources required for implementing the relevant projects vary among schools, and the amount of funding to be granted is determined based on the content of individual applications, the average amount of funding granted cannot fully reflect the actual situation of the programme with respect to its implementation.

(5) The EDB released respectively in May and July 2025 the updated Curriculum Framework of National Security Education in Hong Kong (the Curriculum Framework) and the curriculum frameworks of National Security Education for 27 subjects covering eight KLAs and the Citizenship and Social Development subject, so as to keep national security education abreast of the times, provide teachers with clearer and more comprehensive guidelines, and help schools further promote national security education upon the existing solid foundation.

  After the release of the above frameworks, the EDB has held eight briefing sessions within four months to brief stakeholders, including representatives of school sponsoring bodies, school supervisors, principals and teachers, on the main updates and highlights of the Curriculum Framework and elucidate how the elements of national security education can be incorporated into various KLAs. The EDB will also provide no less than 1 000 teacher training places relating to national security education in the 2025/26 school year. The training programmes will comprise, among others, face-to-face and online courses, study tours, experience sharing sessions and learning circles to enhance teachers' professional competence for the effective implementation of national security education.

(6) This year marks the 80th anniversary of victory in the War of Resistance and the World Anti-Fascist War. With the support of the Central Government, the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, located next to the Marco Polo Bridge in Beijing, has been established as the first Patriotic Education Base for Hong Kong and Macao Youth on August 21 this year.

  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government will continue to promote patriotic education facilities in the Mainland by making them patriotic education bases of the HKSAR, and encourage visits by more students and youths to help them comprehensively understand the history and culture as well as the development and achievements of our country.

(7) In the 2025/26 school year, a number of tours with itineraries designed to help students experience the founding history of our country have been launched starting from October 2025. Schools will be invited to participate in due course. For example, under the ""'Passing on the Torch' Platform Programme Series: An Exploration into the History, Humanities and Ethnic Culture in Guizhou"", students will visit the Guizhou Long March Culture Digital Art Museum, where they will learn about key historical events of the Long March, experience the hardships faced by the Red Army, and gain a deeper understanding of the Long March spirit. The manpower resources required for the relevant Mainland exchange programmes are subsumed under the recurrent expenditure of the EDB."
立法會二十題：青年宿舍計劃的推行情況,2025-10-15 12:47,2025-10-15 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500338.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上鄭泳舜議員的提問和民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟的書面答覆︰

問題：

政府推出青年宿舍計劃已逾13年，由政府全資興建的七個青年宿舍項目中，目前只有兩個投入服務。此外，政府在二○二三年擴大該計劃，資助非政府機構租用合適酒店和旅館轉作青年宿舍（資助計劃），至今已有六個項目獲批。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）五個由政府全資興建但尚未投入服務的青年宿舍項目的最新進度為何，以及該等項目有否出現延誤；如有，原因為何；鑑於政府就2025-2026財政年度開支預算回覆本會議員問題時表示，青山公路及灣仔救世軍街的兩個項目分別處於施工前工程及技術可行性研究階段，政府是否仍會繼續該兩項興建計劃；

（二）資助計劃下的六個青年宿舍項目的最新入住率及租戶數目分別為何；

（三）鑑於於資助計劃規定，青年宿舍項目的青年租戶須每年參加不少於200個小時的社區或志願服務以回饋社區，青年租戶就上述要求的達標率為何（按項目列出）；據悉有青年人擔心未能達到社區服務的時數要求而未有申請入住青年宿舍，政府有否評估有關要求在鼓勵青年回饋社區上的成效；及

（四）據報位於通州街的首個由私人住宅物業轉作青年宿舍項目的部分宿位租金達7,600元至7,800元，而據悉雖然有關租金水平高於政策所訂（即租金水平應在同區附近相似單位市場租金的60%以內），但外界對該項目宿舍的質素反應正面，政府日後會否再接納以私人物業轉作青年宿舍用途的項目申請，又或是否已收到其他同類申請；有否評估，日後該類項目的租金會否有下調空間？

答覆：

主席：

青年宿舍計劃是一項重要的青年發展措施，除了回應青年對擁有自住空間的期望外，我們亦希望租戶在住宿期間透過參與青年宿舍提供不同的支援及訓練而有所得益。民政及青年事務局（民青局）一直以多管齊下的方式，積極落實青年宿舍計劃，其中包括全數資助非政府機構在未盡其用的土地上興建青年宿舍，以及推出青年宿舍計劃－將酒店和旅館轉作青年宿舍用途的資助計劃（資助計劃）等。現時計劃下推出的青年宿舍有八間，合共提供超過3 700個宿位。

就鄭泳舜議員提問的各部分，現回覆如下：

（一）現時由政府全資興建的青年宿舍項目共七個。首兩個由香港青年協會及保良局營運的青年宿舍已分別於二○二○年及二○二三年落成啓用，合共提供超過1 700個宿位。三間分別由香港女童軍總會、香港青少年發展聯會和東華三院正在興建的青年宿舍將於二○二六年起陸續落成，合共提供約1 000個宿位。至於香港聖公會福利協會有限公司及救世軍兩個項目亦正分別進行施工前工程及技術可行性研究。

（二）資助計劃自二○二三年推出至今已批出六個項目並已投入營運，合共提供約2 000個宿位。截至二○二五年八月底，除一般的租戶流轉外，六間已運作一年或以上的青年宿舍（包括由政府全資興建的青年宿舍及資助計劃的項目），房間入住率平均約八成半。

（三）青年宿舍計劃是一個推動青年增值和發展的平台，讓他們可以發揮所長、回饋社會。我們希望青年租戶在住宿期間，可以靈活參與青年宿舍的活動與訓練和地區或志願服務，從而自我增值，擴闊社交網絡，以及更有效規劃個人發展的目標。同樣地，青年宿舍所在社區亦會得益於青年租戶提供的地區服務，令弱勢社羣得到青年人的直接幫助，建立更廣闊的朋輩網絡，長遠有助構建和諧社會。現時青年宿舍整體運作暢順，而營運青年宿舍的非政府機構亦有安排租戶參與青年宿舍的活動（例如創業培訓、身心發展、職場文化等）和地區外展或志願服務。由於推出的青年宿舍的位置、規模及設施各有不同，營運的非政府機構會就其個別實際情況，訂定日常管理安排及營運方式，包括舉辦活動的種類、次數及形式等。民青局會持續監察青年宿舍的運作，因應其實際情況檢討資助計劃的運作安排，並會按需要調整執行細節。

（四）青年宿舍的租金會根據其地點、房間大小、生活配套，以及非政府機構提供的活動及服務等而釐定，租戶可按個人需要及經濟能力作選擇。民青局會繼續以多管齊下的方式，積極推展青年宿舍計劃。我們亦會和理念一致的相關持份者合作，研究以不同方法增加青年宿舍供應，讓更多青年受惠。"
LCQ20: Implementation of Youth Hostel Scheme,2025-10-15 12:47,2025-10-15 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500341.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Vincent Cheng and a written reply by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

It has been over 13 years since the Government launched the Youth Hostel Scheme. Of the seven youth hostel projects whose construction is fully funded by the Government, only two have been put into service. Furthermore, the Government expanded the Scheme in 2023 by subsidising non-governmental organisations in renting suitable hotels and guesthouses for use as youth hostels (the Subsidy Scheme), with six projects approved to date. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the latest progress of the five youth hostel projects whose construction is fully funded by the Government but not yet put into service, and whether there have been any delays in these projects; if so, of the reasons for that; given that in the reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on the Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 2025-2026, the Government indicated that the two projects at Castle Peak Road and Salvation Army Street, Wan Chai were respectively at the ""pre-construction works"" and ""technical feasibility studies"" stages, whether the Government will continue with these two construction projects;

(2) of the latest room occupancy rate and number of tenants of the six youth hostel projects under the Subsidy Scheme respectively;

(3) given that it is stipulated under the Subsidy Scheme that youth tenants of youth hostel projects shall participate in no less than 200 hours of community or volunteer services each year to give back to the community, of the attainment rates of youth tenants in terms of the above requirement (set out by project); as it is learnt that some young people have refrained from applying for youth hostels due to concerns about failing to meet the community service hour requirement, whether the Government has assessed the effectiveness of this requirement in encouraging young people to give back to the community; and

(4) as it has been reported that the rent of some hostel places in the first youth hostel project converted from private residential housing located at Tung Chau Street ranges between $7,600 and $7,800, and it is learnt that that although the rental levels are higher than those stipulated under the policy (i.e. rental levels being within 60 per cent of the market rent for similar flats in nearby areas of the same district), the response from the community to the quality of hostel in this project has been positive, whether the Government will accept further applications for converting private properties into youth hostels in the future, or whether it has already received other similar applications; whether it has assessed if there is room for reducing the rent of such projects in the future?

Reply:

President,

The Youth Hostel Scheme (YHS) is an important youth development initiative. Apart from meeting young people's aspirations of having their own living space, we also hope that youth tenants will benefit through participating in the various support and training activities provided by youth hostels during their stay. The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) has been proactively implementing the YHS through a multi-pronged approach, which includes fully funding non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to construct youth hostels on under-utilised sites, and launching the YHS - Subsidy Scheme for Using Hotels and Guesthouses as Youth Hostels (the Subsidy Scheme). There are currently eight youth hostels launched under the YHS, providing over 3 700 hostel places in total.

In response to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Vincent Cheng, our reply is as follows:

(1) There are currently seven youth hostel projects whose construction is fully funded by the Government. The first two youth hostels run by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups and the Po Leung Kuk have commenced operation upon completion of construction in 2020 and 2023 respectively, offering a total of over 1 700 hostel places. Three youth hostel projects under construction by the Hong Kong Girl Guides Association, the Hong Kong Association of Youth Development and the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals are expected to be gradually completed from 2026 onward, offering a total of about 1 000 hostel places. The Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui Welfare Council Limited's project and the Salvation Army's project are undergoing the pre-construction works and technical feasibility studies respectively.

(2) Since the launch of the Subsidy Scheme in 2023, six projects have been approved and put into use, providing about 2 000 hostel places in total. As at end-August 2025, except for the usual tenant turnover slots, the average room occupancy rate of the six youth hostels (including youth hostels whose construction is fully funded by the Government and projects under the Subsidy Scheme) that have operated for at least a year is about 85 per cent.

(3) The YHS offers a platform to promote youth enrichment and development, enabling them to unleash their strengths and contribute to society. We hope that, through flexible participation in activities/training at youth hostels and community/voluntary services during stay, youth tenants may achieve self-enrichment, expand their social networks and effectively set personal development goals. Meanwhile, the communities where the youth hostels are located will also benefit from the community services provided by youth tenants. This in turn helps the underprivileged obtain direct support from young people and establish a wider peer network, which is conducive to building a harmonious society in the long run. At present, the overall operation of the youth hostels has been smooth. The NGOs operating the youth hostels have also arranged youth tenants to participate in activities at the youth hotels (such as entrepreneurship training, physical and mental development, and workplace culture) and community outreach or volunteer services. As the location, scale and facilities of each youth hostels differ, taking into account their actual circumstances, the NGO operators will make day-to-day management and operational arrangements accordingly, including the type, number and mode of activities to be organised. The HYAB will continue to monitor the operation of the youth hostels, review the implementation arrangements of the Subsidy Scheme according to actual circumstances, and adjust the execution details when necessary.

(4) The rent charged by a youth hostel is determined by its location, room size, ancillary facilities as well as the activities and services to be provided by the NGOs. Youth tenants may, according to their own needs and financial means, choose among different youth hostels. The HYAB will continue to take forward the YHS proactively through a multi-pronged approach. In order to benefit more young people, we will also continue to collaborate with relevant stakeholders sharing our vision to explore different ways to increase the supply of youth hostels."
立法會十九題：提升九龍公園設施,2025-10-15 12:45,2025-10-15 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500316.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上江玉歡議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆︰

有意見認為，九龍公園作為本港市區大型公園之一，擁有豐富歷史遺產，而且地理位置優越。然而，隨着時代變遷，園內部分設施日漸老化及使用率偏低，整體發展潛力尚未得到充分發揮。關於提升九龍公園設施，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年九龍公園各項主要設施（例如游泳池、體育館、兒童遊樂場、歷奇樂園等）的使用人次及使用率，以及滿意度調查結果為何，並按設施類別列出分項資料；

（二）鑑於有意見指出，與九龍公園同屬市區大型休憩空間的維多利亞公園，因經常舉辦多元化大型活動而成為市民及遊客的熱門去處，過去三年該兩個公園相類設施（例如游泳池、體育館／運動場地、兒童遊樂場等）的使用情況的比較為何；有否具體分析該兩個公園設施的使用率出現差異的主要原因；

（三）當局有何恆常機制及具體措施，以定期檢查、維修及更新九龍公園的設施，以確保該等設施符合公眾需求並維持良好狀態；有否制訂優化方案增加九龍公園對本地市民及遊客的吸引力（例如改善園內空間的規劃及設計、增辦多元化活動等），從而提升園內設施的使用率；

（四）當局會否考慮以公私合營的模式為九龍公園進行翻新工程，讓私營機構參與特定園區的設計、營運及維修保養工作，以減輕政府的財政負擔並加速更新設施；及

（五）鑑於政府於去年公布改建九龍公園內前威菲路軍營58座為中華文化體驗館，以及在鄰近的尖沙咀天文台總部興建副樓以提供包括公眾教育資源中心及展覽廊等設施，政府如何將上述項目與九龍公園的現有設施及活動進行整合，以打造統一的休憩、文化及旅遊體驗空間；會否就上述的項目及整合工作設立跨部門協作機制，以發揮協同效應，從而提升區內遊客流量及市民參與度？

答覆：

主席：

康樂及文化事務署（康文署）致力在轄下公園提供多元化的康體和休閒設施，以滿足市民在消閒和康樂活動方面的需要，推廣健康生活模式和普及體育運動。九龍公園是康文署轄下市區大型公園之一，佔地13公頃，提供全面的動態和靜態康樂設施，一直深受市民歡迎。

就江玉歡議員的提問，我現回覆如下：

（一）過去三年，九龍公園主要設施的使用率或訪客人次載列如下：




平均使用率

康文署沒有備存兒童遊樂場和歷奇樂園使用人次的相關資料。

根據二○二五年七月至八月進行的問卷調查，絕大部分（85%）受訪者對九龍公園整體滿意程度為「非常滿意」或「滿意」。

（二）維多利亞公園與九龍公園均設有動態和靜態設施，為受歡迎的大型公園，兩者相類似的設施為游泳池和兒童遊樂場。

康文署沒有備存有關兒童遊樂場使用人次的資料。就游泳池而言，過去三年，九龍公園和維多利亞公園游泳池的使用人次載列如下：




到訪人次

市民會因應其居住地點、工作地點和作息時間等選擇鄰近的游泳池游泳，因此各個游泳池的到訪人數受一系列的因素影響。另外，維多利亞公園與九龍公園內的部份設施亦可供團體租用以舉辦不同規模及類型的活動，既為訪客提供多元化的遊園體驗，亦為不同機構提供優質的活動場地。過去三年，不同團體租用九龍公園以舉辦嘉年華、展覽及比賽等活動超過110次（例如香港國際手球錦標賽、香港室內賽艇錦標賽暨慈善長途接力賽、「國慶75周年紅旗飄揚齊歡呼」活動、全民太極日、香港漫畫星光大道第四期開幕禮等）；而維多利亞公園同期則有超過40次租用，當中包括多項大型活動（例如農曆年宵市場、香港花卉展覽、中秋綵燈會、渣打香港馬拉松及工展會）。

（三）及（四）為持續提升公共服務水平，康文署一直參考訪客和工務部門的意見，為九龍公園制訂各項設施的恆常維修及大型改善計劃，以不斷提升公園的訪客體驗，確保設施的安全性和舒適性，並為訪客提供一個更具吸引力的休閒空間。

在二○二四至二五年度的改善計劃中，康文署除為九龍公園進行恆常的維修及保養工作外，已完成中國花園和兒童遊樂場的翻新工程、以及健身設施和香港漫畫星光大道的優化工程，讓訪客可以享受更好的遊園體驗。另外，康文署在剛完成的水景花園噴水池翻新工程中，增設特別設計造型的熊貓擺設，亦同時優化戶外的洗手間，引入以功夫為主題的設計元素，增添視覺吸引力。至於二○二五至二六年度的改善計劃則會包括歷奇樂園的洗手間翻新工程、百鳥苑及花圃的美化工程等，以進一步提升公園的整體環境，為訪客提供更舒適的休憩空間和更豐富的自然景觀。

康文署會不時檢視公園設施的使用情況，在資源和場地條件許可的情況下，按需要適時制訂和推行合適的設施優化工程，以繼續為九龍公園增添特色，增加吸引力。

此外，在公私合營的管理方面，康文署會視乎公私合營模式的商業可行性和機會，並持開放態度，引入創新思維，積極考慮是否採用公私合營的建議，以提升設施的服務質量，務求為市民帶來更優質的康樂設施和更豐富的訪客體驗。

（五）康文署將改建九龍公園內前威菲路軍營58座及加建新翼，成為一所旨在弘揚中華文化的中華文化體驗館。體驗館將設有多用途的戶外空間，同時糅合九龍公園的自然環境，既可用作舉辦與中華文化相關的活動，亦為市民和旅客提供一處集文化元素與自然景觀於一身的中華文化體驗空間。體驗館亦會善用科技提供多元化的互動體驗和實物學習活動，以吸引市民和旅客參與。"
立法會二題：「BUD專項基金」,2025-10-15 12:45,2025-10-15 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500374.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上陳祖恒議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的答覆：

問題：

二○二五年《施政報告》宣布向「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」（「BUD專項基金」）注資14.3億元，並擴大資助地域範圍。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有業界人士反映，「BUD專項基金」下的簡易申請計劃（「申請易」）極受業界歡迎，政府會否考慮將「申請易」的項目資助上限由10萬元調高至30萬元；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）政府會否考慮將「BUD專項基金」的適用範圍進一步擴大至所有境外市場，以與明年整合至該基金的「中小企業市場推廣基金」的適用範圍看齊，從而更好地支援業界開拓內銷、傳統及新興市場；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於政府經營帳目有望於下一財政年度錄得盈餘，政府會否考慮將「BUD專項基金」的資助配對比率，調整為政府與企業以一對一比率分擔總核准開支，以協助業界升級轉型；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」（「BUD專項基金」）是政府支援中小企業的其中一項措施，目的是支持本地企業升級轉型及拓展多元化市場。由二○一二年成立至二○二五年九月，「BUD專項基金」共批出近12000宗申請，涉及總資助額約75億元，惠及約7800家企業。政府自二○一八年起多次優化「BUD專項基金」，包括注資共77億元、擴闊資助地域範圍、分階段提高每家企業的累計資助上限由50萬元至700萬元，以及推出「申請易」和「電商易」等。

就陳祖恒議員的提問的三個部分，現回覆如下：

（一）「申請易」於二○二三年六月推出，旨在加快審批涉及特定措施而資助金額為10萬元或以下的申請，其申請表格、所須遞交的證明文件要求及審批安排均已簡化，而申請處理時間亦較「BUD專項基金」一般申請的服務承諾大幅減少一半至30個工作天內完成。

截至二○二五年九月底，「申請易」共批出760宗申請，平均資助額約為7.2萬元。我們相信維持現時每宗10萬元的資助上限已可滿足大部分企業的需要。此外，我們亦需確保公帑用得其所，故釐定「申請易」每宗申請款額的上限時，需小心平衡資助款額和潛在財政風險。我們認為目前的安排是合適的。

另外，為了讓企業更迅速地獲得資助，以應對多變的經濟環境，我們自二○二五年三月起已優化「申請易」的安排，讓每間企業由之前每六個月只可遞交一項申請，放寬至每三個月可遞交一項；同時亦增加了建立網上銷售平台為可獲資助的項目措施。

（二）「BUD專項基金」現時的資助地域範圍涵蓋40個已與香港簽署自由貿易協定（自貿協定）及／或促進和保護投資協定（投資協定）的經濟體，佔二○二四年香港對外商品貿易總值約80%。行政長官於二○二五年《施政報告》宣布進一步擴大「BUD專項基金」的資助地域範圍，覆蓋多八個包括「一帶一路」國家在內的經濟體，亦即把基金適用的地域範圍增加20%，以協助中小企業拓展更多元化的市場。同時，鑑於「中小企業市場推廣基金」將於二○二六年七月整合至「BUD專項基金」，我們會加強宣傳和協助企業透過「BUD專項基金」——「申請易」參與展覽會和出口推廣活動。

香港正與多個經濟體探討簽訂投資協定，其中與卡塔爾的投資協定談判已大致完成，雙方將在各自完成所需內部程序後簽署協定。隨着香港日後簽署更多自貿協定或投資協定，「BUD專項基金」資助適用的地域範圍將進一步擴闊。我們亦已自二○二五年三月起擴大「電商易」的資助地域範圍至東南亞國家聯盟10個國家。

（三）多年來，「BUD專項基金」一直積極支援中小企業，期間亦推出了多輪優化措施。同時，企業對政府資助的需求近年大幅攀升，「BUD專項基金」二○二四年的申請宗數較二○一九年增加超過320%，而基金近九成的資助是於最近六年（二○一九年至二○二四年）批出。

為確保「BUD專項基金」的財政可持續性，政府於二○二五年三月推出措施，當中包括調整基金的資助比例至1（政府）：3（企業），希望企業能更慎重選擇適當及具成本效益的項目，並更願意投放資源。有關措施剛於二○二五年三月推出，我們需時檢視成效，故未有計劃調整基金的資助比例。

支援中小企業是政府其中一項重要政策，因此政府於今明兩個財政年度會向「BUD專項基金」注資共超過30億元，惟我們需確保資助計劃的財政可持續性，令更多企業能獲得支援及讓受惠面保持廣泛，故政府會以適時和聚焦的方式審慎運用公帑，以應對複雜多變的經濟環境。

除優化「申請易」和「電商易」外，我們亦已更針對性資助企業推行綠色轉型項目和列明成立新業務單位的有關專業服務費用為可獲資助項目，協助企業重整供應鏈，以應對貿易戰帶來的挑戰。

我們會繼續與業界密切溝通，不時檢視基金的運作情況，為中小企業作出合適支援，同時顧及基金負擔能力及其財政可持續性。"
LCQ2: BUD Fund,2025-10-15 12:45,2025-10-15 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500372.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Sunny Tan and a reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

 The 2025 Policy Address announced an injection of $1.43 billion into the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales (BUD Fund) and an expansion of its geographical scope. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as some members of the trade have relayed that the simplified application track under the BUD Fund (""Easy BUD"") is very popular among the trade, whether the Government will consider raising the funding ceiling for each ""Easy BUD"" project from $100,000 to $300,000; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether the Government will consider further expanding the application scope of the BUD Fund to cover all markets outside Hong Kong, so as to align with the application scope of the SME Export Marketing Fund which will be consolidated into the BUD Fund next year, thereby better supporting the trade in developing domestic sales, as well as traditional and emerging markets; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) given that the Government's Operating Account is expected to record a surplus in the next financial year, whether the Government will consider adjusting the matching ratio of the BUD Fund to 1:1 of the total approved expenditure between the Government and the enterprises, so as to assist the trade in upgrading their operations; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales (BUD Fund) is one of the initiatives of the Government in supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), aiming at assisting local enterprises in upgrading, transformation and development of diversified markets. From its inception in 2012 to September 2025, nearly 12 000 applications have been approved under the BUD Fund, involving a total funding amount of around $7.5 billion and benefitting around 7 800 enterprises. The Government has since 2018 launched several rounds of enhancements to the BUD Fund, including the injection of a total of $7.7 billion, the expansion of the geographical scope, the phased increase of the cumulative funding ceiling per enterprise from $0.5 million to $7 million, and the launch of ""Easy BUD"" and ""E-commerce Easy"", etc.

 The reply to the three parts of the question by the Hon Sunny Tan is as follows:

(1) ""Easy BUD"" was launched in June 2023 to expedite the processing of applications involving designated measures with a funding amount of $100,000 or below. The application form, requirements for supporting documents and vetting arrangements of ""Easy BUD"" have been streamlined. As compared with the performance pledge for general applications of the BUD Fund, the processing time of an ""Easy BUD"" application has also been significantly reduced by half to within 30 working days.

 As at end-September 2025, a total of 760 applications have been approved under ""Easy BUD"", with an average funding amount of around $72,000. We believe that maintaining the funding ceiling of $100,000 for each application can meet the needs of most enterprises. Besides, to ensure the prudent use of public money, we need to strike a cautious balance between the funding amount and the potential financial risks when determining the funding ceiling of each ""Easy BUD"" application. We consider the current arrangement appropriate.

 In addition, to enable enterprises to receive funding support more expeditiously with a view to coping with the ever-changing economic environment, we have enhanced the arrangement of ""Easy BUD"" since March 2025 to allow each enterprise to submit application once every three months, instead of once every six months in the past. We have also expanded the funding scope to include the establishment of online sales platform.

(2) The current geographical scope of the BUD Fund covers 40 economies with which Hong Kong has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) and/or investment promotion and protection agreements (IPPAs), accounting for around 80 per cent of the total value of Hong Kong's external merchandise trade in 2024. The Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address the further expansion of the geographical scope of the BUD Fund to cover eight more economies, including Belt and Road countries, i.e. expanding the geographical scope by 20 per cent, to assist SMEs in developing more diversified markets. Meanwhile, as the SME Export Marketing Fund will be consolidated into the BUD Fund in July 2026, we will enhance promotion and facilitate enterprises' participation in exhibitions and export marketing activities through ""Easy BUD"".

 Hong Kong is exploring the signing of IPPAs with a number of economies, among which the IPPA negotiation with Qatar has been substantially concluded. Both sides will sign the agreement upon completion of respective internal procedures. The geographical scope of the BUD Fund will be further expanded when Hong Kong signs more FTAs or IPPAs in the future. Since March 2025, we have also expanded the geographical scope of ""E-commerce Easy"" to the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

(3) Over the years, the BUD Fund has been actively supporting SMEs, with several rounds of enhancement measures rolled out. At the same time, demand from enterprises for the Government's funding support has surged significantly in recent years. The number of applications for the BUD Fund in 2024 increased by over 320 per cent as compared with that in 2019, and close to 90 per cent of the subsidies under the BUD Fund were approved in the past six years (2019 to 2024).

 To ensure the financial sustainability of the BUD Fund, the Government introduced measures in March 2025, including the adjustment of the funding ratio of the BUD Fund to 1 (Government): 3 (enterprise), such that enterprises could choose appropriate and cost-effective projects more prudently and be more willing to put in resources. Given that the measure was recently launched in March 2025, we need more time to review its effectiveness, and hence do not have plans to adjust the funding ratio.

 Supporting SMEs is one of the Government's important policies. Therefore, the Government will be injecting more than $3 billion into the BUD Fund in the current and the next financial year. This notwithstanding, we need to be mindful of the financial sustainability of the funding scheme with a view to enabling more enterprises to make use of the funding and maintaining an appropriate spread of beneficiaries. As such, the Government will prudently utilise public funds in a timely and focused manner to cope with the complex and ever-changing economic environment.

 Apart from enhancing ""Easy BUD"" and ""E-commerce Easy"", we have been providing more targeted funding support to enterprises in implementing green transformation projects, and have specified that professional fees associated with the establishment of new business entities are fundable, so as to assist enterprises in restructuring their supply chains in the face of challenges brought about by the trade war.

 We will continue to keep in close touch with the trade and will review the implementation of the BUD Fund from time to time to provide appropriate support to SMEs, while taking into account the financial capacity and sustainability of the BUD Fund."
LCQ19: Upgrading facilities at Kowloon Park,2025-10-15 12:45,2025-10-15 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500321.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Doreen Kong and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

There are views that as one of Hong Kong's major urban parks, Kowloon Park is rich with historical heritage and well located. However, with the changes in time, some facilities in the park have become outdated and underutilised, and the overall development potential has yet to be fully realised. Regarding the upgrading of facilities at Kowloon Park, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the numbers of users and utilisation rates of various major facilities at Kowloon Park (such as the Swimming pool, Sports Centre, Children's Playground, Discovery Playground) in each of the past three years, as well as the results of satisfaction surveys, with a breakdown by type of facility;

(2) as there are views pointing out that Victoria Park, which is a major urban recreational space like Kowloon Park, has become a popular destination for members of the public and visitors due to its frequent hosting of diversified large-scale events, of the comparison of the utilisation of similar facilities between these two parks (such as swimming pool, sports centre/sports venue, children's playground) in the past three years; whether it has specifically analysed the main reasons for the differences in the utilisation rates of facilities at these two parks;

(3) of the regular mechanisms and specific measures put in place by the authorities to regularly inspect, maintain and revamp the facilities at Kowloon Park to ensure that such facilities meet the needs of the public and remain in good condition; whether it has formulated enhancement plans to raise Kowloon Park's attractiveness to locals and visitors (such as improving spatial planning and design in the park, organising more diversified events), thereby increasing the utilisation rates of facilities in the park;

(4) whether the authorities will consider adopting a public-private partnership model for the renovation works of Kowloon Park, allowing the private sector to participate in the design, operation and maintenance of specific areas in the park, so as to alleviate the Government's financial burden and accelerate the revamp of facilities; and

(5) given that the Government announced last year the conversion of Block 58 of the former Whitfield Barracks in Kowloon Park into a Chinese Culture Experience Centre, and the construction of an Annex Block at the nearby Hong Kong Observatory Headquarters, Tsim Sha Tsui to provide facilities including a Public Information and Education Concourse and an exhibition gallery, etc, how the Government integrates the above projects with the existing facilities and activities in Kowloon Park to create a unified space for recreational, cultural and tourism experience; whether it will establish an inter-departmental collaboration mechanism for the above projects and integration efforts to create synergy effects, thereby enhancing visitor flow and public participation in the area?

Reply:

President,

The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) is committed to offering diversified recreation, sports and leisure facilities in the parks under its management, with a view to meeting the public's needs for leisure and recreation activities, advocating healthy lifestyle, and promoting sports to the community. The 13-hectare Kowloon Park is one of the LCSD's major urban parks. It offers a full range of active and passive leisure facilities which are well received by members of the public.

My reply to the questions raised by the Hon Doreen Kong is as follows:

(1) Over the past three years, the usage rates or attendances of the major facilities in Kowloon Park are as follows:




Average usage rate
2022
2023
2024


Sports Centre (Main Arena)
98.3 per cent
96.5per cent
98.2per cent








Attendance
2022
2023
2024


Swimming Pool
521 000
661 000
657 000


Aviary
136 000
168 000
185 000


Bird Lake
266 000
346 000
366 000




The LCSD does not keep relevant information on the attendances of the Children's Playground and the Discovery Playground.

According to a questionnaire survey conducted from July to August 2025, the vast majority (85 per cent) of the respondents were generally ""very satisfied"" or ""satisfied"" with Kowloon Park.

(2) Victoria Park and Kowloon Park are popular major parks featuring active and passive facilities. Similar facilities in both parks include swimming pools and children's playgrounds.

The LCSD does not keep information on the attendances of the children's playgrounds concerned. As for the swimming pools, the attendances of the Kowloon Park Swimming Pool and the Victoria Park Swimming Pool over the past three years are as follows:




Attendance
2022
2023
2024


Kowloon Park Swimming Pool
521 000
661 000
657 000


Victoria Park Swimming Pool
469 000
554 000
540 000




Members of the public choose to go swimming in nearby swimming pools based on their place of residence, place of work and daily schedules etc.ãAs such, the attendance of a swimming pool is subject to a series of factors. Besides, some facilities of the Victoria Park and Kowloon Park are available for organisations to hire for staging events of various scales and types, offering diversified park experiences to visitors as well as providing various organisations with quality venues to hold events. Over the past three years, various organisations hired Kowloon Park for more than 110 times to host events such as carnivals, exhibitions, and competitions (e.g. the Hong Kong International Handball Championships, the Hong Kong Rowing Indoor Championships and Charity Rowathon, an event celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a Tai Chi day, and the opening ceremony of Hong Kong Avenue of Comic Stars phase four). Over the same period, Victoria Park was hired over 40 times for holding events, including multiple major events (e.g. Lunar New Year Fair, Hong Kong Flower Show, Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival, Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon, and Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo).

(3) and (4) To continually enhance public service standards, the LCSD has all along been making plans for regular repair and large-scale improvement of various facilities of Kowloon Park taking into account the views of visitors and works departments with a view to enhancing the park visitors' experience, ensuring that the facilities are safe and comfortable, and providing visitors with an even more attractive leisure space.

In the improvement plan for 2024-25, in addition to carrying out routine repair and maintenance works at Kowloon Park, the LCSD has completed the refurbishment works of Chinese Garden and Children's Playground, as well as the enhancement works of fitness facilities and the Hong Kong Avenue of Comic Stars, bringing a better park experience for visitors. In addition, the LCSD installed specially designed and styled panda displays in the recently completed refurbishment project of the fountain at the Water Garden. Outdoor toilets were also enhanced with the introduction of Kung Fu design element for better visual appeal. As for the improvement plan for 2025-26, it will include projects on renovating toilets of the Discovery Playground as well as beautifying the Aviary and flower plots to further enhance the overall environment of the park, thereby providing visitors with more comfortable leisure space and richer natural landscape.

The LCSD will continue to review the usage of park facilities from time to time and, subject to the availability of resources and suitable venue conditions, formulate and carry out appropriate facility enhancement projects as necessary to continue adding unique features to Kowloon Park and enhancing its attractiveness.

In addition, regarding the public-private partnership, subject to its commercial viability and opportunities, the LCSD will keep an open mind, introduce innovative ideas and actively consider adopting public-private partnership proposals in order to enhance the service quality of facilities, thereby providing members of the public with leisure facilities of higher quality and richer visitor experience.

(5) The LCSD will convert Block 58 of the former Whitfield Barracks in Kowloon Park, with the construction of a new annex, into the Chinese Culture Experience Centre which is aiming at promoting Chinese culture. The Experience Centre will feature a versatile outdoor space harmonised with the natural environment of Kowloon Park, serving as a venue for hosting Chinese culture-related activities while offering citizens and tourists a space that combines cultural elements with natural scenery. The Experience Centre will make good use of technology to offer diversified interactive experiences and object-based learning activities to attract participation of both citizens and tourists."
立法會十二題：尖沙咀東的公眾登岸梯台,2025-10-15 12:33,2025-10-15 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500310.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上易志明議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

政府大力推動旅遊業，而維港遊是其中一個深受旅客歡迎的旅遊活動。然而，據悉現時的維港遊主要集中在尖沙咀東海濱進行，惟該處的公眾登岸梯台數量有限，並出現供不應求的情況。有業界人士更指出有船舶霸佔登岸梯台的泊位，導致其他船舶需等候良久才可靠泊，令爭奪泊位的情況時有發生，甚至出現險象環生的危險場面，引發海上安全隱憂。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）尖沙咀東各公眾登岸梯台在平日、周末及內地長假期期間（尤其是黃昏時段）船舶的使用情況及輪候安排分別為何；

（二）有否統計參加維港遊的旅客資料；如有統計，經旅行團及以散客身份參加的人數分別為何；

（三）當局有何措施善用公共資源，以防止有船舶霸佔位於尖沙咀東的公眾登岸梯台，並維持船舶靠泊及旅客登上經營維港遊的船舶的秩序；及

（四）據悉現時在九龍城碼頭附近接待旅行團的食肆及商店數目已大幅減少，不再出現大量旅客聚集的情況，令現時九龍城景雲街公眾登岸梯級的使用量極低，當局會否考慮在可控的情況下，逐步重啓該公眾登岸梯級的使用，例如首先在平日或周末的指定時間，甚至內地長假期期間開放，以分流部分尖沙咀東海濱的維港遊旅客；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

登岸梯台屬於公眾登岸設施，供船隻上落乘客。就尖沙咀東一帶而言，尖沙咀一號梯台現時由康樂及文化事務署（康文署）管理，其餘二號及五號梯台則由運輸署負責管理及監察其使用量；上述公眾登岸梯台均由土木工程拓展署負責其保養及維修。政府會不時檢視公眾登岸設施的使用情況，並聽取持份者的意見，以改善登岸設施的設計及使用安排。

就易志明議員的提問，經諮詢文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）、運輸署及海事處後，現回覆如下：

（一）運輸署約每兩年對其負責管理的逾190個登岸設施（包括公眾碼頭和登岸梯台）進行使用量調查。就尖沙咀東各公眾登岸梯台進行的二○二三至二○二四年度使用量調查結果見於下表：




登岸設施
登岸設施的一天使用量（註一）（艘船）


平日或周六
周日或公眾假期


尖沙咀一號梯台（註二）
--
--


尖沙咀二號梯台

0


尖沙咀五號梯台

0




註一：調查在正常天氣的一天由上午七時至下午八時期間進行。
註二：尖沙咀一號梯台現時由康文署管理，該署沒有備存有關梯台的船隻使用量等資料。

根據康文署及旅遊業監管局（旅監局）的觀察，使用尖沙咀一號梯台參與維港遊活動的運作整體暢順，星光大道的排隊秩序大致良好，未有出現混亂。

（二）現時市場提供觀賞維多利亞港景色的海上旅遊項目及觀光船，供市民和旅客參加。參加維港遊的旅客包括旅行團及個人旅客。

旅行團方面，旅監局估算在二○二五年七月至九月期間，共有約16 000個內地入境旅行團（共約57萬人次）的登記行程中包括乘船遊覽維港（包括參加維港遊或乘搭港內線渡輪）。上述內地入境旅行團一般會在尖沙咀、中環、灣仔或北角上落船。當中接近一半會在尖沙咀區上落船，而其中約八成於天星碼頭登船，餘下約兩成使用尖沙咀一號梯台及其他梯台上落船隻。此外，使用尖沙咀一號梯台上落船的遊覽活動一般為自費項目，團員可按意願自由選擇參與，因此實際參與人數會較登記行程的人數少。

文體旅局並沒有備存旅客以散客身份參加維港遊的數字。

（三）船隻靠泊方面，公眾登岸梯台一般屬全日開放的公共設施，任何船隻只需符合有關的海事規例，保障乘客安全上落船隻，便可使用該等設施。根據《商船（本地船隻）（一般）規例》（第548F章），船隻若在公眾登岸梯台停泊，必須是用作上落乘客用途，且在完成上落乘客後，必須離開公眾登岸梯台，以供其他船隻使用。若於部份時段有較多船隻同時等候使用公眾登岸梯台，船隻需有序輪候，方便乘客上落。

海事處每日在香港各區水域（包括尖沙咀東一帶）巡邏執法，當中包括巡視是否有船隻違規佔用公眾登岸梯台，亦會與警務處進行聯合行動，打擊非法載客、超載等違反海事條例的行為。

旅客秩序方面，旅監局一直密切留意內地入境旅行團登記使用尖沙咀一號梯台參與維港遊的情況，並頻繁地派員巡查及監察該處的運作情況，有關維港遊營辦商均有妥善管理乘客排隊上落的秩序。旅監局亦與旅遊業界、地區人士、警方等保持緊密溝通，推動旅行代理商與維港遊營辦商落實協調、調整及分散旅行團行程的措施，以避免同一時間有過多旅行團聚集於同一地點，並加派人手維持秩序。

（四）現時，九龍城區是最多內地入境旅行團聚集的地區之一，有多個全日對外開放的公眾登岸設施供船隻上落乘客，包括提問提及的景雲街公眾登岸梯級。如維港遊營辦商日後有意在現時上落船地點以外，使用維港兩岸其他登岸設施進行內地入境旅行團維港遊上落客活動，旅監局會與相關的業界、地區人士及政府部門等保持溝通，盡力平衡旅行團在該地點的活動為當區居民生活帶來的影響。"

Question:

  The Government has devoted considerable efforts to promoting tourism, with Victoria Harbour tours being one of the most popular activities among tourists. However, it is learnt that currently Victoria Harbour tours mainly take place along the promenade of Tsim Sha Tsui East, where there is an excessive demand for the limited number of public landing steps. Some industry players have further pointed out that some vessels occupy the berths at the landing steps, forcing other vessels to wait for an extended period of time for berthing. This often leads to competition for berths and even dangerous situations, raising concerns about maritime safety. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective usage and queuing arrangements for the various public landing steps in Tsim Sha Tsui East during weekdays, weekends and Mainland public holidays (particularly during evening hours);

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on visitors joining Victoria Harbour tours; if so, of the respective numbers of those joining through tour groups and as individual travellers;

(3) what measures are in place by the authorities to optimize the use of public resources, prevent vessels from occupying the public landing steps in Tsim Sha Tsui East, and maintain order for berthing of vessels and for passengers boarding the vessels for Victoria Harbour tours; and

(4) as it is learnt that nowadays the number of restaurants and shops near Kowloon City Pier catering to tour groups has significantly dwindled and crowds of tourists no longer exist there, resulting in extremely low usage of the public landing steps at King Wan Street, Kowloon City, whether the authorities will consider gradually reactivating the public landing steps there under controlled circumstances, for example, by first allowing access during specified times on weekdays or weekends, or even during Mainland public holidays, so as to divert some of the visitors of Victoria Harbour tours from the promenade of Tsim Sha Tsui East; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

President,

  Landing steps are public landing facilities for use by vessels for passenger embarkation and disembarkation. Regarding the Tsim Sha Tsui East area, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) currently manages Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1, while the Transport Department (TD) is responsible for managing the remaining Landing No.2 and No.5 and monitoring their utilisation. The Civil Engineering and Development Department is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the aforementioned public landing steps. The Government will review the usage of public landing facilities and gauge the views of stakeholders from time to time to improve the design and usage arrangements of the landing facilities.

  In consultation with the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), the TD and the Marine Department (MD), my reply to the question raised by the Hon Frankie Yick is as follows:

(1)The TD conducts utilisation surveys on the over 190 landing facilities (including public piers and landing steps) under its management about every two years. Survey findings on the utilisation of public landing steps in Tsim Sha Tsui East in year 2023-2024 are shown in the following table:




Landing facility
Daily utilisation of the facility (Note1)
			(No. of vessels)


Weekdays or Saturdays
Sundays or public holidays


Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1 (Note2)

0




Note1: The surveys were conducted between 7am and 8pm on a normal weather day.
Note2: Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1 is currently managed by LCSD, which does not keep information such as its utilisation by vessels.

  According to the observations of the LCSD and the Travel Industry Authority (TIA), participation in Victoria Harbour tours using Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1 has been running smoothly as a whole. The queuing order at the Avenue of Stars is generally good, with no signs of chaos.

(2)At present, marine tourism projects and sightseeing vessels are available in the market for the general public and tourists to enjoy the scenery of the Victoria Harbour. Participants of the Victoria Harbour tours include both tour groups and individual travellers.

  In respect of tour groups, the TIA estimated that between July and September 2025, there were around 16 000 Mainland inbound tour groups (with around 570 000 visitors in total) registered with itineraries including taking vessels to tour the Victoria Harbour (including joining Victoria Harbour tours or taking inner harbour ferry routes). The aforementioned Mainland inbound tour groups generally embark and disembark in Tsim Sha Tsui, Central, Wan Chai or North Point. Nearly half of these groups will embark and disembark in the Tsim Sha Tsui area, among which around 80 per cent will embark at the Star Ferry Pier, while the remaining around 20 per cent will use Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1 and other landing steps for embarkation and disembarkation. In addition, tour activities using Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1 for embarkation and disembarkation are generally self-paid activities, which tour group members could freely choose to participate according to their preference, hence the actual number of participants may be lower than that registered with the itineraries.

  The CSTB does not keep figures on the number of tourists who participated in Victoria Harbour tours in the capacity of individual travellers.

(3)In terms of berthing by vessels, public landing steps are generally public facilities that are open all day and for use by all vessels provided that they comply with the relevant marine regulations to ensure safe embarkation and disembarkation of passengers. Under the Merchant Shipping (Local Vessels) (General) Regulation (Cap.548F), the purpose of berthing at public landing steps should be to enable embarkation and disembarkation of passengers on or from a vessel only. Upon completion of which, the vessel concerned must leave the public landing steps to allow berthing by other vessels. During periods of high demand for the public landing steps, vessels are required to queue up in an orderly manner so as to facilitate passenger embarkation and disembarkation.

  The MD conducts daily patrols and law enforcement in various Hong Kong waters (including the Tsim Sha Tsui East area), including against unauthorised occupation of the public landing steps by vessels. The MD also conducts joint operations with the Police to combat conducts in violation of marine legislations such as illegal carriage of passengers and overloading.

  In terms of order of the tourists, the TIA has been closely monitoring the situation of registered Mainland inbound tour groups using Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No. 1 to participate in Victoria Harbour tours, and frequently deploying staff to monitor and inspect the operating situation on site. The Victoria Harbour operators concerned have been properly managing the order of passengers queuing for embarkation and disembarkation. The TIA also maintains close communication with members of the travel trade, districts, the Police, etc, to facilitate measures to be implemented by travel agents and Victoria Harbour tour operators to co-ordinate, adjust and stagger the itineraries of tour groups, as well as deploy additional manpower to maintain order, with a view to avoiding excessive concentration of tour groups at the same location at the same time.

(4)Kowloon City is currently one of the districts gathered with the largest number of Mainland inbound tour groups. There are multiple public landing facilities that are open all day for use by vessels for passenger embarkation and disembarkation, including the King Wan Street Landing mentioned in the question. If Victoria Harbour tour operators intend to use landing facilities along both sides of the Victoria Harbour other than the current embarkation and disembarkation points for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers from Mainland inbound tour groups participating in Victoria Harbour tours, the TIA will maintain close liaison with relevant members of the trade, districts, Government departments, etc, striving to balance the impact of tour group activities on the local communities at the locations concerned."
LCQ13: Promoting development of artificial intelligence,2025-10-15 12:22,2025-10-15 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500264.htm,"  Following is a question by Professor the Hon William Wong and a written reply by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

There are views pointing out that artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing at a rapid pace and a number of countries such as Singapore and South Korea have formulated their AI development strategies. In parallel, this year's Policy Address has proposed various initiatives to promote the development and application of AI. The State Council also issued in August this year the Opinions on Further Implementing the ""Artificial Intelligence Plus"" Action (the Opinions) setting out phased objectives including realisation of extensive and in-depth integration of AI with six key areas by 2027, full AI empowerment for highâquality development by 2030, and full entry into a new stage of intelligent economic and societal development by 2035. Furthermore, the Opinions propose accelerating the implementation of six key actions, including Artificial Intelligence Plus in scientific and technology, industrial development, consumption upgrades, people's livelihoods and well-being, governance capacity, and global cooperation. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will, by drawing on the practices of other countries and regions, comprehensively review the promotion of AI development in Hong Kong and map out future strategies;

(2) whether it will establish a phased target for Hong Kong to take forward the ""Artificial Intelligence Plus"" action by drawing reference from the objectives and key actions set out in the Opinions;

(3) whether it will formulate policy initiatives to, apart from providing support to individual enterprises, proactively promote the application of AI technology in various industries, thereby enhancing the overall competitiveness of various industries in Hong Kong; and

(4) whether it has reviewed if existing efforts to nurture AI talent are adequate to meet future demand, and whether targets have been set for manpower training in relation to the development of AI in Hong Kong?

Reply:

President,

Having consulted the relevant bureaux, my consolidated reply to the questions raised by Professor the Hon William Wong is as follows:

  AI is leading a new round of scientific and technological revolution, as well as industry transformation. Major economies around the world are leveraging their unique strengths to formulate AI strategies and objectives that align with their development needs. We can see that the global AI development landscape and the strategic deployments of various countries, including the ""AI+"" initiative proposed by our nation last year, as well as the Opinions on Deepening the Implementation of the ""AI Plus"" Initiative released in August this year, focus on key areas such as scientific research innovation, computing infrastructure, data supply, and talent cultivation. These efforts aim to promote the deep integration and application innovation of AI across various industries and sectors of the economy and society.

For Hong Kong, since the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint (the Blueprint) put forth a strategic focus on the development of AI, the Government has set out clear goals for the development of AI, with a focus on ""strengthening infrastructure and promoting the application-oriented approach"". Steady progress has been made in various key areas, including research, infrastructure, data, industry applications, and talent nurturing. The multi-dimensional AI policies and specific measures in Hong Kong are not only in line with the national ""AI+"" initiative but also highly coherent with the global development path of AI. We will also timely review the implementation status and optimise individual policies and support measures according to the latest development needs, to enable AI to empower high-quality development.

In terms of innovative research and development (R&D), the Government has funded the establishment of 16 R&D laboratories focusing on AI and robotic technologies through the AIR@InnoHK research cluster, pooling over a thousand experts and strengthening Hong Kong's capabilities in foundational AI research.

We have just obtained funding approval of $1 billion from the Legislative Council for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute (AIRDI) in 2026, which will facilitate upstream AI R&D, midstream and downstream transformation of R&D outcomes, as well as expansion of application scenarios.

Regarding computing infrastructure, Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre (AISC) will further uplift its computing power within this year to meet the local demand of computing power. To support local institutions, R&D institutes and enterprises in fully utilising the computing power of the AISC, we have launched the $3 billion AI Subsidy Scheme to support large-scale AI scientific research and applications. To date, it has successfully approved more than ten major projects.

In addition, we have just put up for tender a site at Sandy Ridge in the North District for the development of a data facility cluster. It will provide advanced computing power facilities, promoting the development of data and AI-related industries.

In terms of data supply, the Government has been actively implementing the open data policy and encouraging public and private organisations to open up more high-quality data, with a view to providing essential elements for the development of AI in Hong Kong. Currently, the Open Data Portal has published over 5 600 datasets, covering various industries and sectors including finance, education, transportation, community and social welfare, law and security, etc., providing important support for the industries in training algorithms and developing large language models.

Regarding cross-boundary data, the Digital Policy Office introduced the Standard Contract facilitation measure based on the Memorandum of Understanding on Facilitating Cross-boundary Data Flow within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to facilitate the safe and orderly cross-boundary flow of data. We will also actively explore the early establishment of a compliant and secure mechanism for cross-boundary flow of Mainland data to the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Co-operation Zone for scientific research purposes, supporting AI application testing and innovation.

To assist various industries in fully seizing the opportunities brought by AI, the 2025 Policy Address proposed the enhancement of Cyberport's Digital Transformation Support Pilot Programme to empower small and medium enterprises to apply AI solutions through matching resources. The AIRDI will also provide professional advice and recommendations to address the difficulties and pain points encountered by different industries or enterprises in the application of AI. This will assist the industry in effectively matching AI solutions that meet their business needs, extensively expanding AI application scenarios in industries, and enhancing industry competitiveness, thereby facilitating ""industries for AI"" and ""AI for industries"".

Talent is vital in the global AI race. Following the development strategy and goal of enriching innovation and technology (I&T) talent resources and developing an international talent hub outlined in the Blueprint, we have been fully advancing various initiatives to attract overseas AI talent and nurture local AI talent. In particular, we have launched the $3 billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme in September this year to support Universities Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities to attract international top-notch scientific researchers in AI and other fields to Hong Kong to spearhead basic research in frontier technologies. The key initiatives for nurturing local AI talent are as follows:

(i) In terms of secondary and primary schools, the Government has set aside $2 billion in the Quality Education Fund to support the implementation of digital education and will formulate the Blueprint for Digital Education, including optimising the interface between primary and secondary curricula of Information Technology and I&T education, and setting out an ""AI literacy"" learning framework; collaborate with professional bodies to roll out pilot schemes on AI education and enhance AI-related training for teachers; and launch progressively digital platforms and tools equipped with AI under the e-Learning Ancillary Facilities Programme for schools;

(ii) With the support of the Government, the Vocational Training Council established the Hong Kong Institute of Information Technology in 2023, which offered a number of AI-related training programmes such as the Higher Diploma in AI and Smart Technology, the Higher Diploma in Data Science and AI, the Higher Diploma in Applied AI, etc.;

(iii) The UGC encourages universities to offer more programmes related to STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics) and the ""eight centres"" (including international I&T centre) under the National 14th Five-Year Plan. Currently, several universities have offered AI-related UGC-funded undergraduate programmes; and

(iv) Provide internship opportunities in the I&T sector for university students enrolled in STEM (Science, Technology, engineering and mathematics) related programmes through the STEM Internship Scheme."
立法會十三題：推動人工智能發展,2025-10-15 12:22,2025-10-15 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500256.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上黃錦輝議員的提問和創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見指出，人工智能（AI）發展一日千里，多個國家（例如新加坡及韓國）均為AI制訂發展策略。今年《施政報告》亦提出多項推動AI發展及應用措施；而本年八月國務院也發布了《關於深入實施「人工智能+」行動的意見》（《意見》），確立了分階段目標，包括到二○二七年實現AI與六大重點領域深度融合、在二○三○年前推動AI全面賦能高質量發展，以及到二○三五年全面步入智能經濟和智能社會發展新階段。此外，《意見》亦提出加快實施六大重點行動，包括「人工智能+」的科學技術、產業發展、消費提質、民生福祉、治理能力和全球合作。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否參考其他國家及地區的做法，全面檢視香港推動AI發展情況和制訂未來發展策略；

（二）會否參考《意見》確立的目標和重點行動，為香港推展「人工智能+」的行動訂立分階段的目標；

（三）會否制訂政策措施，不單為個別企業提供支援，也主動推動各個行業應用AI技術，從而提升本港各行業的整體競爭力；及

（四）有否檢視現時培育AI人才的工作是否足夠應對未來需求，以及有否就本港AI的發展制訂人才培訓目標？

答覆：

主席：

就黃錦輝議員的提問，經諮詢相關決策局，我現綜合回覆如下：

人工智能（AI）正引領新一輪科技革命和產業變革。世界各主要經濟體均會立足自身優勢，制定符合其發展需要的AI策略及目標。綜觀全球AI發展格局、各國的戰略部署，包括國家於去年提出的「人工智能+」行動及今年八月發布的《關於深入實施「人工智能+」行動的意見》，均聚焦於科研創新、算力基建、數據供應及人才培育等關鍵領域，旨在推動AI與經濟社會各行業及領域的深度融合和應用創新。

就香港而言，自《香港創新科技發展藍圖》提出重點發展AI的策略方針以來，政府已為本港AI發展訂立清晰目標，並以「加強基建，推動應用導向」為重心，針對不同關鍵領域（包括科研、基礎設施、數據、產業應用、人才培訓等）穩步推進多項措施。本港多維度的AI政策及具體措施不但與國家的「人工智能+」行動一脈相承，亦與全球AI發展路徑高度契合。我們亦會適時檢視落實情況及按最新發展需要優化個別政策及支援措施，讓AI賦能高質量發展。

在科研創新方面，政府透過「AIR@InnoHK」研發平台，資助成立了16間專注於AI及機械人科技的研發實驗室，匯聚了過千名科研專才，強化本港的AI基礎研究能力。

我們亦剛剛獲立法會批准撥款10億元，以期於二○二六年成立香港人工智能研發院，促進AI上游研發、中下游成果轉化及開拓應用場景。

在算力基建方面，數碼港人工智能超算中心將於今年年底進一步提升算力水平，以支持本地的算力需求。為支援本地院校、研發機構和企業充分利用超算中心的算力，我們已推出30億元的人工智能資助計劃，以支撐大規模AI科研和應用，計劃至今已成功批出十多個重點項目。

此外，我們剛剛推出位於北區沙嶺的數據園區發展用地進行市場公開招標，以提供先進算力設施，進一步推動數據及AI相關產業發展。

在數據供應方面，政府積極推行開放數據政策，並鼓勵公私營機構開放更多高質量數據，為本港AI發展提供關鍵要素。現時，「開放數據平台」已匯聚超過5 600個數據集，涵蓋財經、教育、運輸、社區及社會福利、法律及保安等不同行業和界別，為業界訓練算法和開發大模型提供重要支撐。

至於跨境數據方面，數字政策辦公室在《促進粵港澳大灣區數據跨境流動的合作備忘錄》的基礎上推出了標準合同便利措施，促進數據安全有序跨境流動。我們會繼續積極探討早日實現內地數據合規安全流動到河套香港園區用於科研，助力AI應用測試與創新。

為協助不同行業充分把握AI帶來的機遇，二○二五年《施政報告》提出優化數碼港「數碼轉型支援先導計劃」，以配對資源賦能中小企應用AI方案。香港人工智能研發院亦將會針對不同行業或企業在應用AI過程中所遇到的難題與痛點，提供專業意見及建議，協助業界有效配對切合其業務需求的AI解決方案，全面拓展產業應用AI場景及提升行業競爭力，促進「AI產業化、產業AI化」。

人才在全球AI競賽中至為關鍵。我們一直循着《藍圖》中「充實創科人才資源，建設國際人才高地」的發展策略及目標，全力推進各項吸引海外和培育本地AI人才的工作，其中，我們已於今年九月推出30億元的「前沿科技研究支援計劃」，支持大學教育資助委員會（教資會）資助院校吸引AI等領域的國際科研頂尖人才來港，帶領前沿科技基礎研究項目。至於培育本地AI人才的重點措施則包括：

（i）中小學方面，政府在優質教育基金預留20億元支援數字教育的推展，並會制定數字教育藍圖，包括優化中小學銜接的資訊和創新科技教育課程、訂定「AI素養」學習架構等；聯同專業團體推行AI教育先導計劃，加強教師AI培訓；陸續推出「電子學習配套計劃」向學校提供包含AI的數字平台及工具等；

（ii）職業訓練局在政府支持下，於二○二三年成立香港資訊科技學院，開辦多個與AI相關的培訓課程，例如AI與智能科技高級文憑、數據科學與AI高級文憑、應用AI高級文憑等；

（iii）教資會鼓勵大學開辦更多與STEAM（科學、科技、工程、藝術及數學）及國家十四五規劃 「八大中心」（包括國際創新科技中心）相關的課程。目前，多間大學已開辦AI相關教資會資助學士學位課程；以及

（iv）透過「創科實習計劃」為就讀STEM（科學、科技、工程及數學）相關課程的大學生提供創科行業的實習機會。"
立法會十四題：確保本地勞工優先就業及勞工權益,2025-10-15 12:18,2025-10-15 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500234.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上鄧飛議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

社會各界一直關注輸入勞工政策對本地勞工就業機會及勞工權益的影響，而二○二五年《施政報告》的附篇亦表示政府會在二○二六年第二季公布檢討「補充勞工優化計劃」的結果，當中包括保障本地勞工優先就業的措施。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）自二○二三年至今，每月各項輸入勞工計劃的申請及獲批宗數為何，並按（i）申請公司的行業分類（依據政府統計處就勞工統計所劃分的行業主類）和（ii）職業分類，以及（iii）‍每宗申請所涉及的輸入勞工人數（例如一人至10人、11人至20人等）列出分項數字；

（二）鑑於有意見指出，勞工處自去年四月起先後關閉三所就業中心，顯著縮減就業中心及行業性招聘中心網絡，令部分本地求職者難以取得即時及全面的就業支援服務，而參加招聘會以獲得即場面試的機會亦相應減少，政府作出有關安排的原因為何；鑑於本港失業率自今年初起有回升趨勢，部分行業（例如建造業）的失業率升幅尤其顯著，但另一方面卻不斷有公司申請輸入勞工，反映本港仍存在一定的就業及招聘需求，勞工處會否考慮回復就業中心及行業性招聘中心的數目（或最低限度維持現有數目），並適度增加招聘會數目，以加強協助本地勞工求職；

（三）自二○二三年至今，每年勞工處就業中心及行業性招聘中心的服務人次、舉辦招聘會數目、參加招聘會的人次及僱主數目、每場招聘會提供的面試平均數目，以及每年該等數據的增減幅度分別為何；

（四）據悉除了建造業輸入勞工計劃明確規定申請公司必須舉辦招聘日，以及飲食業僱主在輸入指定職位時必須在勞工處的就業中心舉行招聘會外，其他輸入勞工計劃／行業並無相關硬性要求，原因為何；

（五）有否考慮要求所有申請輸入勞工的僱主（不論行業、工種及申請輸入勞工數目）必須在勞工處就業中心及行業性招聘中心舉辦招聘日及登記招聘職位，以便利本地求職者申請有關空缺，並確保有關的本地招聘過程公正及真誠，從而杜絕「假招聘」的情況；

（六）自二○二三年至今，每年當局收到多少宗有關以輸入勞工取代本地工人的投訴，當中涉及的行業為何；該等投訴的調查進度及結果為何；當局有何措施進一步防止僱主以輸入勞工取代本地工人；及

（七）鑑於市場上有中介公司／機構（包括非持牌職業介紹所）聲稱可收費協助本地公司申請輸入勞工，當局有否計劃就此作出規管，以保障本地工人、輸入勞工及申請僱主的權益？

答覆：

主席：

為應對人力短缺帶來的挑戰，政府在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，適度容許僱主確實未能在本地聘得合適人手時申請輸入勞工，推動香港的經濟發展。勞工及福利局於二○二三年六月十九日為院舍服務業推出「院舍輸入護理員特別計劃」，發展局和運輸及物流局於二○二三年七月十七日分別為建造業和運輸業（包括航空業及公共小巴／客車行業）推出行業輸入勞工計劃。此外，勞工處自二○二三年九月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），容許有實際需要的僱主申請輸入原有「補充勞工計劃」下一般不得輸入（包括26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位）的勞工。

就議員的提問，經諮詢發展局和運輸及物流局後，現答覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年九月，上述各輸入勞工計劃的申請和獲批宗數載於附件一；優化計劃下申請和獲批宗數按行業劃分的分項數字載於附件二。政府沒有備存每宗申請及獲批並按職業分類及涉及輸入勞工人數劃分的分項統計數字。

（二）及（三）勞工處的就業中心及行業性招聘中心，為求職人士提供多元化及免費的就業服務。此外，勞工處的「互動就業服務」網站及流動應用程式，為求職人士提供24小時網上就業服務和就業資訊。求職人士亦可利用電話就業服務中心的求職人士熱線獲取就業服務。

鑑於現時市民使用網上就業服務的情況日趨普及，為更有效運用公共資源，勞工處於二○二四年四月起調整及優化其就業服務，包括延長就業中心和行業性招聘中心的每日服務時間；電話就業服務中心於辦公時間外增設電話留言服務；以及合併部分就業中心，重新配置人力資源，為市民提供更具成本效益的服務。

二○二三年至二○二五年九月，就業中心及行業性招聘中心每年到訪人數、舉行招聘會數目、參與僱主數目、安排即場面試數目及每場招聘會平均面試數目的統計數字載於附件三。數據顯示，二○二四年起就業中心及行業性招聘中心的每年到訪人數、即場面試數目及每場招聘會平均安排的面試數目均錄得增長。與此同時，勞工處「互動就業服務」網站及流動應用程式錄得的瀏覽和使用次數亦按年遞升，顯示就業中心與網上服務的資源重新配置能繼續為求職者提供適切的服務。

勞工處會繼續密切監察就業市場的變化，適時檢視各項服務，並因應服務需求及市場情況調整及優化服務。

（四）及（五）各輸入勞工計劃的規定和執行安排均確保本地工人優先就業。有關措施包括申請輸入勞工的僱主必須先以不低於市場相類職位的每月工資中位數按有關計劃的規定進行本地公開招聘，優先聘請合資格的本地工人填補空缺。僱主亦必須與輸入勞工簽訂標準僱傭合約，並支付不低於相類職位中位工資的薪金，防止輸入勞工成為廉價勞工，損害本地工人的就業機會。此外，申請輸入勞工的僱主必須符合本地僱員與輸入勞工的人手比例規定。

就優化計劃而言，僱主須以勞工處同意的招聘條件就申請職位進行本地招聘，其間勞工處會在「互動就業服務」網站刊登職位空缺資料，為有關空缺進行就業選配，並將空缺資料發布給勞工顧問委員會委員、相關職工會及培訓機構，以便他們轉介合適的本地求職人士應徵。僱主完成本地招聘程序後，須向勞工處匯報結果，如僱主未能成功招聘合適人選，勞工處會聯繫每名不獲聘用的本地求職者，了解面試詳情。如有證據顯示僱主違反本地招聘的規定，或無合理理由拒絕聘用合資格的本地求職者，勞工處會中止處理有關申請。勞工處亦會向僱主施加行政制裁，拒絕處理他們提交的其他申請，禁制期可達兩年。

二○二五年《施政報告》宣布，由二○二五年九月十八日起，經優化計劃申請輸入侍應生及初級廚師時，僱主須進行的本地招聘由四星期延長至六星期，並須每周參加一次勞工處指定的在就業中心舉行的招聘會。這措施顧及個別行業勞動力市場的變化並聚焦於輸入勞工較多的指定工種。政府會繼續動態監察就業情況，靈活調整實施安排，致力確保本地就業優先。

（六）獲批准輸入勞工的僱主不得以輸入勞工取代在職本地僱員。如需裁員，僱主應先裁減輸入勞工。勞工處自二○二五年六月起實施新措施，包括在優化計劃專題網頁新增網上投訴表格，方便本地僱員及輸入勞工就僱主涉嫌違反優化計劃的規定作出投訴。此外，勞工處的勞工督察不時巡查輸入勞工的工作地點，查核僱主有否遵守優化計劃的規定。僱主如違反相關規定，勞工處會對有關僱主作出行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准及拒絕處理其隨後兩年提交的輸入勞工申請。

勞工處自二○二三年九月四日推行優化計劃以來，於二○二三年（九月四‍日至十二月三十一日）、二○二四年及二○二五年（截至九月三十日）分別接獲一宗、19宗及321宗懷疑僱主以輸入勞工取代在職本地僱員的投訴。有關投訴主要涉及餐飲服務業、製造業及清潔服務業。勞工處已就所有收到的投訴展開調查，包括到輸入勞工的工作地點進行巡查及搜證，並向僱主及僱員詳細查證在輸入勞工到職後本地員工的數目有否減少、減少的原因及僱主有否進行本地招聘填補已離職的本地僱員。

上述接獲的投訴中，勞工處已完成調查68宗個案，其中67宗沒有足夠證據確立僱主違反優化計劃的規定，而其他投訴個案仍在調查中。就一宗違反規定的個案，勞工處於二○二五年八月二十九日公布，向該名僱主施加行政制裁，撤銷該僱主就優化計劃已獲發的輸入勞工原則性批准及拒絕處理其隨後兩年提交的輸入勞工申請。

LCQ14: Ensuring local workers' employment priority and labour rights,2025-10-15 12:18,2025-10-15 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500252.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Tang Fei and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

 Various sectors in the community have all along been concerned about the impact of labour importation policy on local workers' employment opportunities and labour rights, and the Supplement to the 2025 Policy Address also states that the Government will announce the findings of the review of the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme in the second quarter of 2026, including measures to safeguard employment priority for local workers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the monthly number of applications received and approved under various labour importation schemes since 2023, with a breakdown by (i) type of industry of the applicant companies (based on the industry section defined by the Census and Statistics Department for labour statistics), (ii) classification of occupations, and (iii) the number of imported workers involved in each application (e.g. One to 10 persons, 11 to 20 persons, etc);

(2) as there are views pointing out that the Labour Department (LD) has closed three job centres since April last year, which has significantly reduced the network of job centres and industry-based recruitment centres and made it difficult for some local job seekers to obtain immediate and comprehensive employment support services, prompting the chances of getting on-the-spot interviews by attending job fairs to reduce correspondingly, of the reasons for making such arrangements; given that unemployment rate in Hong Kong has rebounded since the beginning of this year, and the increase was particularly notable in some industries such as construction, and on the other hand some companies have continuously applied for labour importation, indicating that there is considerable needs for employment and recruitment in Hong Kong, whether the LD will consider reinstating the number of job centres and industry-based recruitment centres (or at least maintaining the current number) and appropriately increasing the number of job fairs to enhance support for local workers in job-seeking;

(3) of the respective number of service users of LD's job centres and industry-based recruitment centres in each year since 2023, the number of job fairs organised, the number of attendances and employers participating in the job fairs, the average number of interviews offered in each job fair, and the respective rates of change of such numbers in each year;

(4) as it is learnt that apart from the explicit requirement for applicant companies to arrange recruitment days under the Labour Importation Scheme for the Construction Sector and the requirement for employers of the catering industry to organise job fairs at the LD's job centres when importing workers for designated posts, there is no such mandatory requirements for other labour importation schemes/industries, of the reasons for that;

(5) whether it has considered requiring all employers applying for labour importation (regardless of industry, job category and number of workers applied for) to arrange recruitment days and register available jobs at the LD's job centres and industry-based recruitment centres so as to facilitate local job seekers to apply for such vacancies and ensure fairness and sincerity in the local recruitment process, thereby eliminating ""bogus recruitment"";

(6) of the number of complaints received by the authorities regarding the displacement of local workers with imported workers in each year since 2023 and the industries involved; of the progress and findings of the investigations into such complaints; of the authorities' measures in place to further prevent employers from displacing local workers with imported workers; and

(7) given that intermediaries/organisations (including unlicensed employment agencies) in the market have claimed to assist local companies in applying for labour importation subject to a charge, whether the authorities have plans for regulation in this regard to protect the rights of local workers, imported workers and applicant employers?

Reply:

President,

 To cope with the challenges brought by manpower shortage and foster Hong Kong's economic development, the Government, on the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, suitably allows employers with genuine difficulty in recruiting suitable local workers to apply for importation of workers. On June 19, 2023, the Labour and Welfare Bureau introduced the Special Scheme to Import Care Workers for Residential Care Homes for the residential care home sector. On July 17, 2023, the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB) respectively launched sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction and transport sectors (including the aviation industry and the public light bus/coach trade). In addition, the Labour Department (LD) has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023, allowing employers with genuine needs to apply for importation of workers for posts that were generally excluded under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme (including the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts).

 In consultation with the DEVB and the TLB, the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) As at September 2025, the numbers of applications received and approved under various labour importation schemes are at Annex 1. A breakdown of the numbers of applications received and approved by industry under the ESLS is at Annex 2. The Government does not maintain breakdowns of the numbers of applications received and approved by post and number of imported workers involved in each application.

(2) and (3) The LD provides diversified and free employment services to job seekers through its job centres and industry-based recruitment centres. In addition, LD's Interactive Employment Service website (iES) and mobile application offer round-the-clock online employment services and employment information. Job seekers can also call the job seeker hotline of the Telephone Employment Service Centre (TESC) of the LD to obtain employment services.

 In view of the increasing popularity of online employment services among the general public and to utilise public resources more effectively, the LD has adjusted and enhanced its employment services since April 2024, including extending the daily service hours of job centres and industry-based recruitment centres, introducing voicemail service of the TESC outside office hours, merging certain job centres and redeploying manpower resources, to provide more costâeffective services to members of the public.

 From 2023 to September 2025, the numbers of visitors, job fairs held, participating employers, on-the-spot interviews arranged and the average number of interviews per job fair recorded by job centres and industry-based recruitment centres each year are at Annex 3. The data indicates that from 2024 onwards, job centres and industry-based recruitment centres have recorded increases in the numbers of annual visitors and on-the-spot interviews as well as the average number of interviews per job fair. In tandem, the numbers of page views and usage counts for the iES website and mobile application also recorded year-on-year increases, indicating that the job centres and online employment services continue to provide optimal services to job seekers after redeploying the resources.

 The LD will continue to closely monitor changes in the employment market, review the services provided in a timely manner, and make adjustments and enhancements to services in light of the service needs and market situation.
     
(4) and (5) The requirements and implementation arrangements of various labour importation schemes ensure the employment priority for local workers. Relevant measures include employers applying for importation of labour must first undertake local open recruitment according to the requirements of relevant schemes at a salary not lower than the median monthly wage of a comparable position in the market and accord priority to employing qualified local workers to fill the job vacancies. Employers must also sign a Standard Employment Contract with imported workers, and shall pay a salary not lower than the median monthly wage of a comparable position to prevent the imported workers from becoming ""cheap labour"" and undermining the employment opportunities of local workers. Besides, employers applying for importation of labour should meet the manning ratio requirement of local employees to imported workers.

 For the ESLS, employers shall adopt the recruitment terms agreed by the LD and undergo local recruitment for the applied posts. During the recruitment period, the LD will publish the job vacancies on iES, conduct job matching for relevant vacancies and disseminate the vacancy information to members of the Labour Advisory Board, relevant trade unions and training institutions to facilitate their referral of suitable local job seekers for application. Upon completion of the local recruitment procedures, employers shall report the results to the LD. If an employer is unsuccessful in employing suitable candidate(s), the LD will contact each local job seeker who is not employed to verify the interview details. If there is evidence showing that an employer has violated the requirements of local recruitment or refused to employ qualified local job seekers without reasonable grounds, the LD will terminate the processing of the relevant application. The LD will also impose administrative sanction on the employer and refuse to process any other application(s) submitted by the concerned employer, with a debarment period up to two years.

 The 2025 Policy Address announced that, with effect fromSeptember 18, 2025, the local recruitment period of employers applying for importing waiters/waitresses and junior cooks will be extended from four weeks to six weeks, during which an employer must attend an on-site job fair once a week at a job centre assigned by the LD. This measure takes into account changes in the labour market of individual industries and focuses on job categories with more imported workers. The Government will continue to closely monitor changes in the employment situation and adopt a flexible approach to adjust the implementation arrangements, striving to ensure the priority for local employment.

(6) Employers approved to import workers shall not displace serving local employees with imported workers. In the event of redundancy, imported workers should be retrenched first. The LD has implemented new measures since June 2025, including launching an online complaint form on the ESLS dedicated webpage to enable local employees and imported workers to lodge complaints against employers over suspected breaches of the ESLS requirements. In addition, Labour Inspectors of the LD conduct inspections of workplaces of imported workers from time to time to verify whether employers are complying with the ESLS requirements. If an employer has violated relevant requirements, the LD will impose administrative sanction on that employer, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of labour previously granted to the employer and refusal to process other subsequent applications for labour importation in the following two years.

 Since the implementation of the ESLS on September 4, 2023, the LD received one, 19 and 321 complaints in 2023 (from September 4 to December 31), 2024 and 2025 (as at September 30) respectively alleging that employers had displaced serving local employees with imported workers. These complaints mainly involved food and beverage services, manufacturing and cleaning services. The LD has launched investigations into all complaints received, including conducting inspections and evidence-gathering at the workplaces of imported workers, verifying with employers and employees in detail whether the numbers of local staff had decreased after the arrival of imported workers, the reasons for the decrease and whether the employers had undertaken local recruitment to fill the vacancies left by the departing local workers.

 Of the above complaints received, the LD completed the investigation of 68 cases, of which 67 did not have sufficient evidence to establish that the employers had violated the ESLS requirements, while the remaining cases are still under investigation. In one of the cases where a violation was found, the LD announced on August 29, 2025 the imposition of administrative sanction on that employer, and withdrew the approvals for importation of labour previously granted and refused to process its subsequent applications for labour importation in the following two years.

(7) Any person or institution who operates a business in Hong Kong for the purpose of obtaining employment for another person or supplying the labour of another person to an employer is regarded as an employment agency (EA) and is subject to regulation under the Employment Ordinance, the Employment Agency Regulations and the Code of Practice for Employment Agencies. All EAs operating in Hong Kong, regardless of their mode of operation or categories of jobs offered (including those involving imported workers), must first obtain an EA licence issued by the LD before commencing operation. If any person or institution is found operating an EA without a valid licence, the LD will conduct investigations seriously and take enforcement actions, and instigate prosecution where there is sufficient evidence to substantiate an offence. The LD also reminds the public on the dedicated webpage of the ESLS to stay vigilant towards advertisements or messages claiming to provide servicesfor recruiting Mainland workers and to ascertain the capability of an enterprise to operate the business to avoid being deceived or misled, which may result in financial loss or delay in the processing of applications.

 Besides, to strengthen the protection for Mainland workers, the Government requires employers who are granted approval-in-principle/quotas to import workers under various labour importation schemes and intend to import workers from the Mainland must recruit the workers through enterprises which have been approved by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China and granted the permission to operate business on labour service co-operation with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Government has implemented a monitoring mechanism that requires employers to submit designated documents containing information about the relevant approved labour service enterprises when applying for entry permits for the Mainland workers with the Immigration Department (ImmD). Otherwise, the ImmD will not process relevant applications."
立法會十六題：便利表演團體來港的措施,2025-10-15 12:10,2025-10-15 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500268.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上陳恒鑌議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

政府宣布於今年二月二十六日起，就各項人才與資本投資者的入境計劃（指明入境計劃）增設申請費600元，並將簽證／入境證的簽發費分別上調至600元（逗留期限180日或以下）及1,300元（逗留期限181日或以上）。有意見反映，上述簽證收費對由其他地區來港並靠捐款維持營運的表演團體（例如在盂蘭勝會表演的神功戲戲班）造成沉重的財政壓力，影響傳統文化的傳承及交流。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年經指明入境計劃獲批來港的中國內地民間傳統表演團體（包括神功戲戲班）數目及所涉及的人員為何（以表列出）；

（二）據悉不少地區團體在慶典活動時均會邀請中國內地的表演團體來港演出，以促進文化交流，政府會否考慮對該等沒有向公眾收取演出費用的表演團體人員豁免簽證申請費及簽發費，或推行分級收費制度，以鼓勵民間的文化交流及促進文化遺產傳承；

（三）自「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（短期訪客計劃）於二○二四年恆常化以來，透過該計劃獲准在以訪客身分逗留期間，參與文化藝術界別指定短期活動的中國內地表演團體數目為何；及

（四）鑑於有意見指出，地區團體對民間傳統表演團體表演的需求甚殷，但表演團體透過短期訪客計劃來港須獲得認可主辦機構（例如文化體育及旅遊局）以邀請信的方式作出認可，過程上存在一定難度，政府會否考慮進一步簡化相關申請程序，以令更多表演團體可在無須申請工作簽證的情況下來港交流？

答覆：

主席：

就陳恒鑌議員的提問，經諮詢保安局、勞工及福利局及入境事務處（入境處）後，現回覆如下：

（一）具備香港所需且缺乏的特別技能、知識或經驗的內地居民，可在符合條件的情況下透過「輸入內地人才計劃」（提問所指的「指明入境計劃」）申請來港工作，包括短期或一次性項目為本的工作。二○二二年、二○二三年及二○二四年間，「輸入內地人才計劃」下的獲批申請中，涉及「藝術／文化界別」內地人才的獲批申請數目分別為285宗、2 496宗及4 618宗。入境處並無備存當中涉及內地民間傳統表演團體（包括神功戲戲班）的分項統計數字。

（二）至（四）政府在制訂「輸入內地人才計劃」的收費水平時已平衡各方面的考慮因素。其中，考慮到部分申請涉及短期／一次性項目的工作，政府實施兩級制簽發費，逗留期限為180日或以下的簽證／入境證簽發費為600元，而181日或以上的則為1,300元，屬合理和可負擔範圍水平。政府會密切留意相關情況，按機制適時檢討收費架構。

此外，為促進更多人才訪港交流，政府於二○二二年六月推出為期兩年的「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利先導計劃」（先導計劃），並於二○二四年六月把先導計劃恆常化為「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（短期訪客計劃）。在短期訪客計劃下，獲政府相關決策局／部門認可的機構可向界別內相關的非本地人才發出邀請信，獲邀人士可以訪客身分來港參與指定短期活動，而無須向入境處申請工作簽證／進入許可。他們每次來港可在不超過連續14個曆日期間參與指定短期活動，並可就該指定活動收取報酬。

截至二○二五年六月底，先導計劃及短期訪客計劃已合共批准讓超過36 950名非本地人才以訪客身分來港參與共6 200多項短期活動及盛事。其中，自二○二四年六月恆常化以來，共有超過1520名非本地人才獲批參與「文化藝術」界別下的指定短期活動。入境處沒有備存提問提及內地表演團體透過短期訪客計劃來港的統計數字。

為確保短期訪客計劃與時並進，政府不時審視計劃的涵蓋範圍及運作機制，務求使計劃能夠在風險可控的前提下，持續有效地促進相關界別發展，並提升香港的國際形象。自先導計劃推出以來，政府分別在二○二三年二月及二○二四年六月擴大計劃，在原有10個指定界別外，增加「金融」及「發展與建築」兩個界別，認可機構亦從計劃剛推出時約350個增加18%至現時的400多個，當中包括政府決策局／部門、公營／法定機構、專業組織和業界協會等。計劃下設有機制，各參與的政策局／部門均需協助把關，確保計劃的執行持續符合政策目標。短期訪客計劃的相關資料，包括目前涵蓋的認可機構和指定短期活動已上載入境處網站︰www.immd.gov.hk/hkt/services/visas/stv.html。

政府會繼續留意短期訪客計劃的實施情況和相關部門及業界的意見，適時檢討計劃的涵蓋範圍，以期在入境管制與便利之間取得適當平衡。在考慮是否進一步放寬短期訪客計劃時，政府必須考慮兩大原則，即合資格根據計劃來港進行指定短期活動的人士不會取代本地勞動力，及不會構成濫用風險（包括非法就業）。"
LCQ16: Measures to facilitate entry of performing groups into Hong Kong,2025-10-15 12:10,2025-10-15 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500270.htm,"âFollowing is a question by Dr the Hon Chan Han-pan and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

As announced by the Government, with effective from February 26 this year, a new application fee of $600 has been introduced for various admission schemes for talents and capital investors (specified admission schemes), and the visa/entry permit issuance fees have been raised to $600 (with a limit of stay of 180 days or below) and $1,300 (with a limit of stay of 181 days or more) respectively. There are views relaying that the aforesaid visa fees have put heavy financial pressure on performing groups coming from other places to Hong Kong and relying on donations to maintain their operation (e.g. Shengong opera troupes performing at the Yu Lan Festival), thus affecting the transmission and exchange of traditional cultures. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of Chinese Mainland traditional folklore performing groups (including Shengong opera troupes) admitted to Hong Kong under the specified admission schemes in each of the past three years, as well as their members involved (set out in a table);

(2) as it is learnt that quite a number of district organisations will invite Chinese Mainland performing groups to perform in Hong Kong during celebration events to promote cultural exchanges, whether the Government will consider waiving visa application and issuance fees or introducing a tiered fee system for members of those performing groups which do not charge the public for their performances, so as to encourage cultural exchanges in the community and promote the transmission of cultural heritage;

(3) of the number of Chinese Mainland performing groups permitted under the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (the STV Scheme) to participate in specified short-term activities in the arts and cultural sector during their stay as visitors since the regularisation of the scheme in 2024; and

(4) as there are views pointing out that although there is strong demand from district organisations for performances by traditional folklore performing groups, the visits of performing groups to Hong Kong via the STV Scheme are subject to the endorsement of the authorised host organisations (e.g. the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau) by way of invitation letters, which involves some difficulties in the process, whether the Government will consider further streamlining the relevant application procedures to enable more performing groups to come to Hong Kong for exchanges without having to apply for employment visas?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Security Bureau, the Labour and Welfare Bureau and the Immigration Department (ImmD), the reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Chan Han-pan is as follows:

(1) Eligible Mainland residents who possess special skills, knowledge or experience of value to and not readily available in Hong Kong may apply to come to work in Hong Kong under the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP) (the ""specified admission scheme"" as referred to in the question), including short-term or one-off project-based employment, if the conditions are met. In 2022, 2023, and 2024, the numbers of approved applications under the ASMTP related to the Mainland talents of the arts/culture sector were 285, 2 496 and 4 618 respectively. The ImmD does not maintain a breakdown of the statistics on applications involving traditional folk performing groups from the Mainland (including Shengong opera troupes).

(2) to (4) In devising the fee levels for the ASMTP, the Government has balanced various considerations. Among others, noting that some applications relate to short-term/one-off project-based employment, the Government has introduced two tiers of visa/entry permit issuance fee: $600 for visa/entry permit granted with a limit of stay of not more than 180 days, and $1,300 for those with a limit of stay of 181 days or more. The fee levels are modest and affordable. The Government will closely monitor the relevant situation and review the fee structure as appropriate in accordance with the established mechanism.

Besides, to encourage more talents to come to Hong Kong for exchanges, the Government launched a two-year Pilot Scheme on Immigration Facilitation for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (Pilot Scheme) in June 2022, which was regularised as the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (STV Scheme) in June 2024. Under the STV Scheme, organisations authorised by the relevant government bureaux/departments (B/Ds) can issue invitation letters to relevant non-local talents in their sectors. Invited persons may come to Hong Kong to participate in specified short-term activities as visitors without the need to apply for employment visas/entry permits from the ImmD. They may participate in specified short-term activities for up to 14 consecutive calendar days during each trip to Hong Kong, and receive remuneration for the specified activities concerned.

As of end-June 2025, the Pilot Scheme and the STV Scheme have approved for a total of more than 36950 non-local talents to enter Hong Kong as visitors to participate in a total of over 6 200 short-term activities and major events. Among others, since the regularisation of the scheme in June2024, a total of more than 1520 non-local talents have been approved to participate in the specified short-term activities under the ""Arts and Cultural"" sector. The ImmD does not maintain statistics of Mainland performing groups entering Hong Kong under the STVScheme as mentioned in the question.

To ensure that the STV Scheme keeps pace with the times, the Government reviews its coverage and operation mechanism from time to time, with a view to ensuring that it can continue to effectively promote the development of relevant sectors and raise Hong Kong's international profile while ensuring that the risks are manageable. Since the launch of the Pilot Scheme, the Government has expanded the scheme in February 2023 and June 2024, by adding two sectors, namely ""Finance"" and ""Development and Construction"", to the original 10 designated sectors. The number of authorised organisations has also increased by 18 per cent from around 350 when the scheme was first launched, to more than 400 at present. These authorised organisations include government B/Ds, public/statutory organisations, professional bodies and industry associations. Through an established mechanism, all participating B/Ds are required to assist in ensuring that the implementation of the scheme consistently meets policy objectives. Relevant information of the STVScheme, including the authorised organisations and specified short-term activities that are currently covered by the scheme, is available on the ImmD's website: www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/stv.html.

The Government will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the STVScheme as well as the views of the relevant departments and the sectors concerned, and timely review the scheme's coverage to strike an appropriate balance between immigration control and facilitation. In considering whether to further relax the STV Scheme, the Government shall take into account two major principles, i.e. eligible individuals visiting Hong Kong for specified short-term activities under the scheme will not displace the local workforce, and there will not be a risk of abuse (including illegal employment)."

答覆：

主席：

二○二五年立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日舉行，以選出第八屆立法會共90名議員。立法會選舉直接關係到「一國兩制」行穩致遠和香港特別行政區（特區）良政善治，長治久安，因此，特區政府極為重視。

就陳勇議員的各項提問，經諮詢公務員事務局，現綜合回覆如下：

目前，立法會換屆選舉的籌備工作正進行得如火如荼。選舉事務處積極進行各方面工作，包括部署選務人手安排、為選舉工作人員安排培訓及演練、為選舉資訊科技系統進行多輪測試、設置投票站、制訂保安及應變計劃等，以確保選舉在公平、公正、誠實、安全有序、高效和人性化的情況下順利舉行。

選舉提名期將於十月二十四日展開並至十一月六日結束。選舉事務處已準備就緒，為接受和處理提名表格作出妥善安排。待候選人資格審查委員會確認候選人資格後，選舉事務處會為候選人舉行簡介會，講解投票及點票安排。選舉事務處將會在十一月底前向選民及獲授權代表發送投票通知卡和候選人簡介等相關資料，通知他們應前往投票的投票站，以及讓選民對有關的候選人有更多認識。

為便利選民投票及提升其投票體驗，選舉事務處會繼續提供合併投票安排，讓選民可在同一投票站投下所有選票。一般而言，選舉事務處會編配選民在其選區並鄰近其登記住址的投票站投票。其他便利投票的措施包括：

（一）選舉事務處會設立鄰近邊境投票站，以便利投票日須往返内地的選民投票並為選擇這些投票站的選民進行預先登記；

（二）除了投票通知卡，選民可登入「選民資料網上查閱系統」檢視自己的登記詳情、獲編配的投票站及地圖、候選人簡介等資料；

（三）設立特別隊伍，讓有需要人士（即年滿70歲或以上人士、孕婦及因身體狀況而難以長時間站立排隊的人士）優先領取選票，並在投票站內設立座位區，供他們輪候時休息；以及

（四）超過九成的投票站將會設於無障礙場地，行動不便或需使用輪椅的選民若獲編配的投票站不方便他們進出，他們可在投票日前五天或之前向選舉事務處提出申請，重新編配到同一地方選區另一個設於無障礙場地的投票站。選舉事務處亦會按他們的需要協助聯絡香港復康會安排復康巴士接載他們往返投票站。

特區政府不斷致力優化選舉的各項流程安排。我們根據實際情況和需要，全盤考慮科技應用、效率提升、安全穩妥、私隱保障和公眾觀感等因素，引入更多資訊科技和智能技術。選舉事務處將：

（一）在功能界別選舉引入電子點票系統輔助點票，以達致提速、提效，以及長遠減省人手的目標；

（二）提升「選民資料網上查閱系統」以支援選民透過「智方便」登入系統，查閱獲編配的投票站及地圖、候選人簡介等資料；

（三）把大部分選舉相關表格電子化，即候選人可選擇使用電子填寫的功能，及透過網上平台提交，例如授權／委任各類代理人的選舉表格、與選舉廣告有關的選舉表格；以及

（四）新增以快速支付系統「轉數快」繳交選舉按金的選擇，候選人也可繼續使用現金、銀行本票及支票支付。

政府正以多元及多渠道方式廣泛宣傳選舉，增強市民對選舉的認知，以鼓勵他們踴躍投票。具體的宣傳活動包括舉辦社區互動活動（如巡迴展覽、攤位遊戲等）、懸掛戶外及交通廣告（如大廈外牆及街道張貼大型戶外廣告、港鐵巴士燈箱廣告等）、運用傳統及社交媒體宣傳（如電台電視及Facebook和Instagram等），以及其他大型重點活動如研討會及綜合晚會等。此外，政府亦會以創新且貼地的形式走進社區，例如在全港多處設置選舉吉祥物「票箱家族」的裝置，並結合擴增實境（AR）及虛擬實境（VR）技術，邀請市民互動體驗、拍照並上傳至社交媒體。同時，政府亦會將選舉與全國運動會的宣傳工作相互配合，以產生協同宣傳效果。

公務員是特區政府治理體系中的重要部分，肩負貫徹落實「一國兩制」和支持特區政府施政的責任。公務員應以身作則行使公民責任投票，在社會上起帶頭作用。選舉的工作由籌備、投票至點票環節，都涉及大量公務員一起參與，同心協力做好每一項工作。在二○二三年區議會一般選舉期間，特區政府透過不同的宣傳方式，例如向公務員發信、向部門辦公室派發宣傳單張、於社交平台發帖文／短片、走訪社區活動等，呼籲全體公務員，以至全港選民積極參與投票。有關安排都十分成功，並獲得公務員及市民的熱烈響應。特區政府在今次立法會換屆選舉中會繼續運用多元化、全方位的形式，積極做好各項宣傳推廣工作，推動公務員投入選舉。就投票日當天上班的人員，部門的主管人員必須容許需要投票的同事離開工作崗位到所屬票站投票，並為此訂定時間表，讓他們有序地前往投票，時間表亦須呈交有關部門首長，同事可申請發還往返辦公室和其所屬票站的交通（包括的士）費用。"

Question:

  Regarding the 2025 Legislative Council General Election (LCGE), will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the preparations for the 2025 LCGE, including the key stages of work, current progress and subsequent material junctures;

(2) of the specific new measures the Government has put in place to promote the 2025 LCGE, and of the progress of preparation and expected outcomes of the relevant publicity work;

(3) of the measures the Government has put in place to provide further convenience to electors, so as to enhance their voting desire and improve their voting experience;

(4) in respect of the application of technologies, whether the Government has plans to introduce more technology initiatives in public elections to further improve electoral processes and efficiency; if so, of the current progress of the study on this front; and

(5) given that during the 2023 District Council Ordinary Election, the Government had encouraged civil servants to duly fulfil their civic responsibilities and vote on polling day through various activities, how the Government will further encourage civil servants to actively participate in voting during the 2025 LCGE so as to set a good example in society?

Reply:

President,

  The 2025 Legislative Council General Election (LCGE) will be held on December 7 to return 90 members of the eighth term Legislative Council (LegCo). The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government attaches great importance to the LegCo election as it is directly related to the steadfast and successful implementation of ""one country, two systems"" and to the good governance and long-term stability of the HKSAR.

  Having consulted the Civil Service Bureau, a consolidated reply in response to the various questions raised by the Hon Chan Yung is as follows:

  The preparations for the LCGE are currently in full swing. The Registration and Electoral Office (REO) is actively undertaking a wide range of tasks, including the deployment of electoral staff, provision of training and drills for electoral staff, conduct of multiple rounds of testing for election information technology systems, set up polling stations, formulation of security and contingency plans, to ensure that the election will be smoothly conducted in a fair, just, honest, safe and orderly, efficient and user-friendly manner.

  The nomination period will run from October 24 to November 6. The REO had made appropriate arrangements and is ready to receive and process nomination forms. Upon the Candidate Eligibility Review Committee's confirmation of the eligibility of candidates, the REO will hold a briefing session for candidates to explain the polling and counting arrangements. The REO will send poll cards, Introduction to Candidates and related materials to electors and authorised representatives before the end of November, with a view to notifying them of their assigned polling station for casting their votes and enabling electors to gain a better understanding of the candidates concerned.

  To facilitate electors in casting their votes and enhance their voting experience, the REO will continue adopting the combined voting arrangement to allow electors to cast all their votes at the same polling station. In general, the REO will assign electors to vote at the polling station within their constituency and close to their registered residential address. Other facilitation measures for voting include:

(i) the REO will set up Near Boundary Polling Stations to facilitate electors who need to travel to and from the Mainland on the polling day. Prior registration will be made for electors who choose to vote at these polling stations;

(ii)besides the poll card, electors may access the Online Voter Information Enquiry System (OVIES) to view their registration details, assigned polling station and location map, and Introduction to Candidates, etc.;

(iii)a special queue will be set up for individuals in need (viz. persons aged 70 or above, pregnant women, and persons who are unable to queue for a long time due to physical conditions), who will have priority to obtain their ballot papers. A seating area will also be provided in the polling station for these electors to take rest while waiting; and

(iv)over 90 per cent of polling stations will be set up at venues with barrier-free access. If electors who have mobility difficulties or need to use wheelchair are allocated to inaccessible polling stations, they may apply to the REO at least five days before the polling day for re-allocation to a polling station set up at an accessible venue within the same geographical constituency. Where necessary, the REO will also assist in contacting the Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation for arranging Rehabuses to transport them to and from polling stations.

  The HKSAR Government has been striving to enhance the various electoral procedures and arrangements. We will, in light of the actual circumstances and needs, take holistic consideration of such factors as the application of technology, enhancement of efficiency, safety and security, privacy protection and public perception, etc, in introducing the wider use of information and smart technologies. The REO will:

(i)introduce the electronic counting system for the functional constituency election to facilitate vote counting, with a view to enhancing the speed, efficiency and achieving the target to reduce manpower in the long run;

(ii)upgrade the OVIES to support electors'login via ""iAM Smart"" for viewing their assigned polling station and its location map, Introduction to Candidates, etc;

(iii)digitalise most election-related forms, which allows candidates to use the electronic filling function and submit through the online platform, such as electoral forms for authorising/appointing various types of agents and forms relating to election advertisements; and

(iv)provide a new option of paying election deposits via the Faster Payment System, while candidates may continue to use cash, cashier's order or cheque for payment.

  The Government is promoting the election through diverse activities and channels to enhance the public's understanding of the election and encourage them to vote actively. Specific promotional activities include organising community interactive activities (such as roving exhibitions and game booths, etc), placing outdoor and transport advertisements (such as large outdoor advertisements on external walls of buildings and streets, as well as MTR and bus lightbox advertising, etc), launching promotion through traditional and social media platforms (such as radio, television, Facebook and Instagram, etc), and conducting other large-scale events such as a seminar and variety show, etc. In addition, the Government is reaching out to the community with a novel and down-to-earth approach. For example, the installation of the election mascots Ballot Box Family at various locations across the territory is combined with augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies to invite the public to interact, take photos and upload them to the social media. At the same time, the Government will co-ordinate the promotional efforts for the election and the National Games to create synergetic publicity effect.

  As a key component of the HKSAR Government's governance system, civil servants shoulder the responsibility of fully implementing ""one country, two systems"" and supporting the governance of the HKSAR Government. Civil servants should take the lead in society and set an example by fulfilling their civic responsibility to vote. A large number of civil servants have been engaged in election-related work, from preparation, polling to counting, who have made concerted efforts to ensure the smooth completion of every task. During the 2023District Council Ordinary Election, the HKSAR Government appealed to all civil servants as well as electors in Hong Kong to actively cast their votes through various publicity channels, such as writing to civil servants, distributing promotional leaflets to departmental offices, publishing posts/videos on social media platforms, holding events to reach out to the community, etc. The related arrangements were very successful and received overwhelming response from civil servants and the public. For the upcoming LCGE, the HKSAR Government will continue to employ diverse and comprehensive means to proactively optimise various publicity and promotional initiatives, with a view to encouraging civil servants to participate in the election. As for staff who are required to work on the polling day, departmental managers must release those who need to vote to cast their votes at their designated polling stations. Timetables should be prepared accordingly to facilitate staff to leave the office for voting in an orderly manner. Also, such timetables must be submitted to the Heads of Departments concerned. Colleagues may apply for reimbursement of transport (including taxi) fares for travelling between their offices and designated polling stations."

LCQ7: Safety of hikers,2025-10-15 11:30,2025-10-15 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500243.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon So Cheung-wing and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

 It has been reported that quite a number of members of the public like hiking alone, but accidents involving lone hikers have occurred from time to time in recent years. There are views that lone hikers are often unable to report to the Police for assistance promptly after accidents, causing delays in search and rescue (S&R) operations, and in the absence of reminders from companions, they are susceptible to underestimating trail risks or overestimating their physical fitness, thus resulting in accidents. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of requests for assistance involving lone hikers in the past three years; the number of casualties in such cases requesting assistance, and the Government expenditures involved in the relevant S&R operations;

(2) whether it has studied the main causes of hiking accidents in the past three years; whether it has compiled statistics on the proportion of lone hikers and group hikers in such accidents, and the differences in the difficulty and duration of search and rescue between the two; and

(3) whether it will step up publicity to encourage hiking in groups, and classify dangerous paths as ""accident black spots for lone hikers"" to alert hikers not to go there alone?

Reply:

President,

 Having consulted the Security Bureau, the reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon So Cheung-wing is as follow:

(1) In the past three years, the number of mountain search and rescue calls received by the Fire Services Department (FSD) and the number of casualties involved are tabulated below:




Year
Number of mountain search and rescue calls received
Number of Injuries (Fatalities)


2022
1 014 cases
589 (20)


2023
695 cases
424 (15)


2024
588 cases
345 (15)




 The FSD does not maintain statistics on the number of cases of lone hikers seeking assistance. As the above rescue operations did not involve additional manpower and salary expenditure, the FSD does not keep a breakdown of the expenditure involved.

(2) and (3) The causes and nature of hiking accidents are complex and varied, apart from factors of terrain and environment, they also include changes in weather, hikers getting lost, and other personal reasons of hikers. Regarding the number of mountain rescue cases, the Government does not have the breakdown of the cases by the proportion of hiking alone versus hiking with others, nor the figure of the difference in the time used for search and rescue operations between those two kinds of hikers. However, hiking alone will have higher safety risks than hiking with others, and poses greater difficulty on search and rescue when accidents occur. The Government has been urging the public to hike with others instead of hiking alone through various channels, including disseminating relevant information through the ""Enjoy Hiking"" website (www.hiking.gov.hk) of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, producing online videos, and regular publishing reminder posts on social media platform, etc. The AFCD also collaborates with other relevant departments to enhance relevant promotion and education during hiking season.

 Moreover, we continuously encourage hikers to download mobile applications relevant to emergency rescue (such as ""Enjoy Hiking Hiker Tracking Service"" mobile application, HKSOS, etc.), to raise the hikers' awareness of hiking safety, and enhance efficiency of rescue operations when accidents occur. The ""Enjoy Hiking"" website provides comprehensive information on various hiking trails, including trail length, overall difficulty, nearby facilities, for hikers to plan hiking trips that are suitable for themselves according their personal conditions. The website also lists out high risk locations with records of fatal and serious accidents in country parks, which are formulated based on previous records of serious and fatal accidents, causes of such accidents, as well as site conditions, with a view to reminding hikers to avoid visiting those areas. The list will be regularly reviewed and updated as appropriate."

問題：

政府於去年十二月公布將會採用智慧綠色集體運輸系統推展南港島線（西段），替代原有重型鐵路方案，並計劃在今年內開展詳細規劃及設計，目標爭取在二○二七年開展前期建造工程。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）南港島線（西段）項目的規劃及設計工作的最新進展為何，以及何時公布整項工程的具體詳情，包括預計的動工及竣工日期，以及涉及的人手及開支等；

（二）就在南港島線（西段）引入中國內地或海外採用的智慧綠色集體運輸系統、先進技術和管理模式，政府曾經進行哪些相關的可行性研究，以及該等研究的結果為何；政府是否已基於研究結果得出初步的傾向性取態和決定；及

（三）鑑於根據政府資料，南港島線（西段）將途經數碼港及香港大學等創科發展的核心區域和院校，為促進本港創科的可持續發展，政府有否全面檢視該項目的施工計劃及時間表，以令其可盡快上馬和落成通車；若有，詳情為何（包括整個項目如何分階段進行、有哪些工序可精簡和壓縮、相關工程造價、預計最早通車時間，以及其他可令工程提速、提效的具體措施）？

答覆：

主席：

南港島線（西段）初步走線全長約7.5公里，途經香港仔、華富、數碼港、瑪麗醫院及薄扶林一帶，為香港島的西部及南部地區提供便捷的接駁交通服務，便利市民前往港鐵南港島線黃竹坑站和港島線香港大學站。就提問各部分，經諮詢路政署，現回覆如下：

（一）我們一直積極推展南港島線（西段）的規劃工作，並於去年十二月及今年一月先後向立法會鐵路事宜小組委員會及南區區議會匯報項目的最新進展。我們正繼續評估項目的財務安排，包括進一步優化走線以及提高成本效益，以期今年內開展項目詳細規劃及設計，並爭取於二○二七年開展前期建造工程。我們的目標是在今年內公布項目的最新推展時間表。

當詳細規劃及設計階段開展後，我們會就項目進行法定環境影響評估，以及評估項目在建造期間及建成後對其他道路使用者的交通影響。我們亦會與不同持份者溝通，聽取意見，並敲定建議方案的細節（包括系統設計、造價、財務安排、管理模式等）。

（二）根據政府就不同智慧綠色集體運輸系統項目進行的研究和系統供應商及營運商提供的資訊，智慧綠色集體運輸系統為中低運量系統。相比重型鐵路系統，智慧綠色集體運輸系統體積較小，主要採用膠轆行駛，特點是輕巧、爬坡能力強，所引致的噪音及景觀影響會相對較少，加上系統一般不需要架空電纜等設施，機電支援系統及維修保養工程相對簡單。這類系統適合在上坡、已發展及空間有限的地區行駛，普遍能夠避免深入地底，減少乘客往返地面的時間，預期能夠提高運輸效益。南港島線（西段）項目採用的智慧綠色集體運輸系統將會在詳細規劃及設計階段，經參考各種先進系統技術和營運模式後敲定。

（三）我們一直與其他政府部門和機構緊密協調，務求南港島線（西段）項目能夠妥善銜接香港大學、數碼港及沿線其他設施，並盡量配合相關發展。正如回覆第一部分所述，項目建議方案的細節會在詳細規劃及設計階段敲定。我們會積極考慮採取各種創新技術，如組裝合成法，盡量壓縮推展時間，以盡快落成通車。我們亦會繼續審視並研究其他提速提效的方法，包括加快審批流程等，力爭早日完工。"

LCQ8: South Island Line (West) project,2025-10-15 11:30,2025-10-15 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500189.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Duncan Chiuand a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

The Government announced in December last year that it would adopt Smart and Green Mass Transit System (SGMTS) to take forward the South Island Line (West) (SIL(W)) as an alternative to the original heavy rail scheme. Detailed planning and design are scheduled to begin within this year, with the aim of striving to start the preliminary construction work in 2027. In ‍this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the latest progress of the planning and design work for the SIL(W) project, and the expected announcement date for the specific details of the entire project, including the estimated start and completion dates, as well as manpower and expenditure involved;

(2) regarding the introduction of SGMTS, advanced technologies and management models adopted in the Chinese Mainland or overseas for the SIL(W) project, of the relevant feasibility studies that have been conducted by the Government and the findings of these studies; whether the Government has reached preliminary inclination or decision based on the study findings; and

(3) given that, according to Government information, SIL(W) will pass through core innovation and technology development areas and institutions, such as Cyberport and the University of Hong Kong, whether the Government has holistically reviewed the project's construction plan and timetable to facilitate its early commencement and completion, with a view to promoting the sustainable development of innovation and technology in Hong Kong; if so, of the details (including how the entire project will be carried out in phases, which work procedures can be streamlined and compressed, the relevant construction costs, the earliest expected commissioning date, and other specific measures to enhance speed and efficiency of the project)?

Reply:

President,

The preliminary alignment of the South Island Line (West) (SIL(W)) is about 7.5-kilometre long, passing through areas around Aberdeen, Wah Fu, Cyberport, Queen Mary Hospital and Pok Fu Lam. It will provide a convenient feeder services connecting the western and southern parts of Hong Kong Island and facilitate the public to go to the MTR Wong Chuk Hang Station of the South Island Line and HKU Station of the Island Line. Having consulted the Highways Department, the reply to the respective parts of the question is as follows:

(1) We have been actively taking forward the planning work of the SIL(W) and updated the Legislative Council Subcommittee on Matters Relating to Railways and the Southern District Council on the latest development of the project in December last year and January this year respectively. We are continuing to evaluate the project's financial arrangements, including further optimising the alignment and improving cost-effectiveness, with a view to commencing the detailed planning and design of the project within this year and striving to commence the advance construction works in 2027. We target to announce the latest implementation programme of the project this year.

Once the detailed planning and design stage has commenced, we will conduct the statutory environmental impact assessment for the project and assess its traffic impact on other road users during and after construction. We will also engage various stakeholders, gather their feedback, and finalise the details of the proposed scheme (including the design of the system, cost, financial arrangements and management mode).

(2) With reference to the studies by the Government on different Smart and Green Mass Transit System (SGMTS) projects and the information obtained from the system suppliers and operators, SGMTS is a medium-to-low capacity system. Compared to the heavy rail system, SGMTS is smaller in size and mainly runs on rubber tyres. Characterised by its lightweight and strong climbing capability, it would induce less noise and visual impacts. Furthermore, the system generally does not require the installation of overhead lines, and its electrical and mechanical support systems and maintenance works are relatively simpler. This type of system is suitable for operating in hilly, developed and congested areas. It can generally avoid running deep underground and reduce the time of passengers traveling to and from the ground level, and is expected to enhance the transport benefits. The SGMTS to be adopted in the SIL(W) project will be determined in the detailed planning and design stage, upon taking into account advanced technologies and operating modes of different systems.

(3) We have been co-ordinating closely with other government departments and organisations for smooth interfaces of the SIL(W) project with the University of Hong Kong, Cyberport and other facilities along the alignment and for facilitating related developments as much as possible. As mentioned in Part (1) of the reply, the details of the proposed scheme of the project will be finalised during the detailed planning and design stage. We will actively consider adopting different innovative technologies, such as the use of Modular Integrated Construction (MiC), to compress the implementation programme as much as possible for the commissioning of the project at the earliest. We will also continue to explore and review other methods to enhance the speed as well as efficiency, including expediting the approval process, to strive for early completion of the project."
LCQ18: Legislation related to protecting children,2025-10-15 11:05,2025-10-15 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500220.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Judy Chan and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

  There are views that safeguarding children's safety and well-being is of paramount importance, but as the scope of Hong Kong's legislation related to protecting children and the age ceilings for children stipulated therein are inconsistent, a review is warranted. For example, under the Employment of Children Regulations (Cap. 57B), persons who have attained 13 and 15 years may be employed in non-industrial establishments and in industrial work respectively; under the Marriage Ordinance (Cap. 181), persons who have attained 16 years may marry upon production of written consent from their parents or guardians; while under section 27 of the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212), the age ceiling for children stipulated in respect of the offence of ""ill-treatment or neglect by those in charge of child or young person"" is 16, and parents may breach the law by leaving children aged below 16 unattended at home. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of persons convicted for contravening section 27 of Cap. 212 in each of the past five years, and among them, the number of cases involving leaving children unattended at home;

(2) as it is learnt that some schools have informed parents that students in primary three or above may travel to and from school by themselves without parental escort, whether the authorities know about this situation, and whether clear guidelines regarding the requirements of relevant legislative provisions under Cap. 212 are issued to schools, with a view to preventing the occurrence of accidents;

(3) whether it has plans to comprehensively review the legislation related to safeguarding children's safety, with a view to standardising the standards and better safeguarding the well-being of children; and

(4) as the Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address that the School-based After School Care Service Scheme would be enhanced by uncapping the number of places to expand support for primary students and parents in need, but there are views pointing out that the scheme only covers primary students, and under the existing provisions of section 27 of Cap. 212, it implies that parents with children aged 12 to below 16 still face difficulties in going out to work, whether the Government has policy initiatives in place to assist such parents, so as to encourage childbearing and unleash the labour force?

Reply:

President,

  The Government has been adopting a multi-pronged strategy to protect children from harm or abuse. Apart from identifying and intervening in child abuse cases at an early stage to protect children, the Government also supports families at risk of child abuse to prevent child abuse at source. The consolidated reply to the Member's question, in consultation with the Security Bureau and the Education Bureau (EDB), is as follows:

(1) The number of persons convicted of an offence under section 27 of the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212), i.e. ill-treatment or neglect by those in charge of child or young person, from 2020 to the first half of 2025 is set out in the Annex. The Government does not compile statistics on the number of these cases involving leaving children unattended at home.

(2) and (4) Section 27 of the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212) stipulates that any person over the age of 16 years who wilfully assaults, ill-treats, neglects, abandons or exposes such child or young person under the age of 16 years under his custody, charge or care in a manner likely to cause such child or young person unnecessary suffering or injury to his health shall be guilty of a criminal offence.

Specifically, whether allowing a child to travel to and from school by themselves or leaving a child unattended at home would constitute an offence under the above legislation depends on a number of factors and has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, including the child's age and self-care abilities, whether the act has caused harm to the child, whether the person involved has a responsibility of care over the child, and whether the person has intentionally neglected the child and is aware of the possible harm to the child caused by his act, and cannot be generalised.

Regarding the ways students commute between homes and schools, the EDB attaches great importance to students' safety and has been working with schools to create a safe environment for students. The EDB has compiled the School Administration Guide and the ""Checklist of Student Safety and Health Measures"" to support schools in fulfilling their responsibilities and enhancing student safety and health management. Currently, primary schools generally have established school-based policies to ensure the safe and orderly transportation of students, including school bus services, returning-home teams, and designated parent drop-off/pick-up areas. If parents choose to have their children travel to and from the school independently, they should consider the distance from their residence to the school and their children's ability to manage themselves. Schools should also teach students about road safety, including the importance of always obeying traffic rules, to foster effective learning and healthy development of students through home-school co-operation.

In respect of the School-based After School Care Service Scheme (the Scheme), the Government launched the Scheme in the 2023/24 school year, with a view to allowing primary students in need to stay after school to receive care and learning support in a safe and familiar environment, and enabling parents to take up jobs. Both dual-income families and single-parent families will be benefitted. In the 2025/26 school year, the Scheme is further enhanced by uncapping the number of service places to expand support for primary students and parents in need. As secondary school students enter adolescence, their self-care abilities are generally higher. Their service needs become different from those of primary school students, and the support required by their parents is also different. There are 139 Integrated Children and Youth Services Centres in Hong Kong, providing comprehensive and diversified services, including guidance and counselling, supportive programmes, developmental and socialisation programmes, and community engagement programmes, which enable youths to enrich and enhance themselves during leisure time.

(3) At present, there are many pieces of legislation in place that protect children from different kinds of harm, including the Employment of Children Regulations (Cap. 57B), the Marriage Ordinance (Cap. 181), the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200), the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212), the Protection of Children and Juveniles Ordinance (Cap. 213), the Prevention of Child Pornography Ordinance (Cap. 579), and the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance (Cap. 650) which will be effective from January 20, 2026. The Government will continue to ensure the proper and solid implementation of these pieces of legislation, and will suitably monitor their effectiveness and consider how to further strengthen child protection, including reviewing the relevant child protection legislation when there is an actual need."
立法會十八題：保護兒童的相關法例,2025-10-15 11:05,2025-10-15 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500213.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上陳家珮議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，保障兒童的安全及福祉極為重要，但本港保護兒童的相關法例的尺度及所訂的兒童年齡上限並不統一，有需要作出檢討。例如在《僱用兒童規例》（第57B章）下，年滿13歲及15歲者分別可受僱於非工業機構和受僱於工業工作；在《婚姻條例》（第181章）下，年滿16歲者可在提交父母或監護人的書面同意書後結婚；而在《侵害人身罪條例》（第212章）第27條下，有關「對所看管兒童或少年人虐待或忽略」罪行所訂的兒童年齡上限則為16歲，家長獨留不足16歲兒童在家便可能觸犯法例。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年因觸犯第212章第27條而遭定罪的人數，以及當中涉及獨留兒童在家的個案數目為何；

（二）據悉有學校向家長表示，小學三年級或以上的學生已可無須家長接送並自行往返學校，當局是否知悉有關情況，以及有否就第212章的相關法例規定向學校作出清晰指引，以防範意外發生；

（三）有否計劃全面檢討保護兒童安全的相關法例，以統一標準及更好地保障兒童的福祉；及

（四）鑑於行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》宣布會優化在校課後託管服務計劃，取消名額上限以擴大支援有需要的小學生和家長，但有意見指出該計劃只涵蓋小學生，按現時第212章第27條的規定，意味育有12歲至16歲以下兒童的家長仍難以外出工作，政府有否政策措施協助該等家長，以鼓勵生育及釋放勞動力？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直以來採取多管齊下的策略保護兒童，令他們免受傷害或虐待。政府除了及早識別和介入虐待兒童個案以保護兒童，亦會支援有虐兒風險的家庭從源頭上預防虐待兒童。就議員的提問，經徵詢保安局及教育局，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）二○二○年至二○二五年上半年，因干犯《侵害人身罪條例》（第212章）第27條，即虐待或忽略所看管的兒童或少年人，被定罪的人數見附件。政府沒有備存其中涉及獨留兒童在家的個案數目。

（二）及（四）《侵害人身罪條例》（第212章）第27條規定，任何超過16歲的人如故意襲擊、虐待、忽略、拋棄或遺棄由他所管養、看管或照顧的16歲或以下的兒童或少年人，而相當可能導致其受到不必要的苦楚或健康損害，即屬犯罪。

具體而言，容許兒童自行往返學校或獨留兒童在家會否觸犯上述條例取決於多方面因素，並視乎個別案情而定，例如該兒童的實際年齡和自我照顧能力，有關行為是否對兒童構成傷害、涉案人士是否有照顧責任、是否有意圖疏忽照顧該兒童及是否知悉其行為可能會對該兒童構成傷害等，不能一概而論。

就學童往返學校的方式，教育局十分重視學生的安全，並一直與學校攜手合作，致力為學生締造安全的環境。教育局已為學校編訂《學校行政手冊》和「學生安全及健康措施一覽表」，支援學校履行其職責，提升學生安全及健康管理。現時，小學普遍已訂定校本政策安排學生安全有序往返學校，包括校車服務、放學隊、家長接送等候區等。如有家長選擇讓其子女自行往返學校，應考慮其居住地點與學校的距離、子女的自理能力等；與此同時，學校亦應教導學生交通安全知識，包括時刻遵守交通規則，透過家校合作促進學生有效學習和健康成長。

就在校課後託管服務計劃（計劃），政府在二○二三／二四學年推行計劃，讓有需要的小學生可在課後留校，在安全熟悉的環境下接受託管及學習支援，方便家長外出工作，雙職及單親家庭亦可受惠。政府在二○二五／二六學年進一步優化計劃，取消名額上限，擴大支援有需要的小學生和家長。中學生踏入青少年階段，自理能力一般較高，服務需要與小學生不相同，家長需要的支援也不相同。全港有139間綜合青少年服務中心提供全面及多元化的服務，包括指導和輔導、支援計劃、發展和社交活動，以及社區參與活動，讓青少年在課餘時間充實及增值自我。

（三）現行多條法例保護兒童免受不同種類的傷害，包括《僱用兒童規例》（第57B章）、《婚姻條例》（第181章）、《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）、《侵害人身罪條例》（第212章）、《保護兒童及少年條例》（第213章）、《防止兒童色情物品條例》（第579章）、及將在明年一月二十日生效的《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》（第650章）等。政府會繼續確保各法例的實施妥善到位，並會適時監察成效，考慮如何進一步加強保護兒童的工作，包括在有實際需要時檢討各保護兒童的相關法例。"
漁護署呼籲掃墓人士小心山火,2025-10-15 11:00,2025-10-15 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101400233.htm,"漁農自然護理署（漁護署）今日（十月十五日）呼籲重陽節期間前往郊外掃墓的市民謹慎處理火種，防止山火發生。

漁護署發言人表示，根據《林區及郊區條例》（第96章），任何人在郊區留下火種或隨意燃燒冥鏹可被檢控。一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二萬五千元及監禁一年。

重陽節期間，漁護署人員會加強巡邏郊野墓地，如發現違規情況，會採取執法行動。

大部分在郊外發生的山火均由人為疏忽引致。掃墓人士只要遵從一些簡單守則，便可避免該等意外發生：

＊應使用工具清除雜草，切勿以火燃燒野草；
＊應在化寶盆或鐵桶內燃燒香燭及冥鏹；
＊切勿遺下尚在燃燒的祭品；以及
＊離開墓地時確保所有火種已熄滅。

發言人說，重陽節期間，漁護署會在郊野公園適當地點向有需要的掃墓人士派發鐵桶供其焚燒冥鏹。此外，漁護署亦會聯同消防處及民眾安全服務隊人員，在多個山火黑點附近巡邏及派發防火宣傳單張。

發言人提醒市民必須妥善清理帶來的祭品及垃圾，保持郊野清潔。"

AFCD urges grave sweepers to prevent hill fires,2025-10-15 11:00,2025-10-15 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101400228.htm,"The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) today (October 15) reminded people paying tribute to ancestors at graveyards in the countryside during the Chung Yeung Festival period to exercise caution and prevent hill fires.

An AFCD spokesman said it is an offence under the Forests and Countryside Ordinance (Cap. 96) to leave behind kindling or burn offerings without considering fire risks in the countryside. Any person who contravenes the ordinance may be prosecuted and is liable to a maximum fine of $25,000 and one year's imprisonment upon conviction.

AFCD staff will step up patrols at graveyards in the countryside during the Chung Yeung Festival period and take enforcement action against any irregularities.

The majority of hill fires in the countryside are caused by human negligence. Accidents can be prevented if grave sweepers observe some simple guidelines:

* Remove weeds around graves with tools and never burn weeds;
* Burning should only be done inside a container or iron bucket;
* Never leave burning offerings unattended; and
* Make sure all kindling is put out before leaving.

The spokesman said that metal containers for burning offerings properly will be handed out to grave sweepers who have such a need at suitable locations in country parks during the Chung Yeung Festival. The AFCD will also patrol hill fire black spots and distribute hill fire prevention leaflets together with the Fire Services Department and the Civil Aid Service.

Members of the public are reminded to keep the countryside clean and properly clean up their offerings or rubbish."

Upon arrival, he attended the annual Gala Dinner of the National Committee on United States-China Relations (NCUSCR) and met with the NCUSCR Chair and former US Trade Representative, Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky. During their meeting, they exchanged views on current China-US economic and trade relations, as well as issues relating to trade, investment and financial markets between Hong Kong and the US. Mr Chan also briefed Ambassador Barshefsky on the latest developments in Hong Kong.

During the meeting, Mr Chan expressed his pleasure at having the opportunity to visit the US again and engage in face-to-face exchanges with leaders from the American political, business and academic communities, with a view to briefing them on the latest developments of Hong Kong. He noted the strong and close economic and trade ties between Hong Kong and the US. Despite the significant uncertainties currently facing the global economy, under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong will continue to maintain its status as a free port, uphold the common law system and rule of law, sustain a simple and low tax regime, and implement open, stable and predictable economic and trade policies. Hong Kong continues to welcome US businesses to invest and expand their presence in the city. Mr Chan recognised the important and active role the NCUSCR has long played in promoting Hong Kong-US economic and trade relations and expressed hope for continued close co-operation with the Committee to create more opportunities for the business communities of both places.

The Gala Dinner is a major annual event organised by the NCUSCR, bringing together prominent political, business and academic leaders from both China and the US, with a view to facilitating exchanges and co-operation between the two countries. This year's event was attended by around 300 leaders and guests, including China's Ambassador to the US, Mr Xie Feng, who gave a speech at the dinner.

文化體育及旅遊局局長：（中國香港隊）贏不到當然有少許可惜，不過我們頂得住1比1都是開心的。我很開心見到我們香港隊今日全部球員很拼搏，打出了我們中國香港隊應有的精神，還有數名球員全場沒有停過，（例如）茹子楠、14號劉家喬、陳晉一等真的沒有停過。我想我們盡了力，亦拿到一分，希望可以在接下來下一場主場取勝。我亦很感謝球迷沒有停過打氣，我也聲沙，他們可以喊了數小時還這麼好力氣，完全繼續為我們港隊主場打氣，很感謝他們。我也很開心有一場很好的比賽讓大家觀賞到。

記者：有這麼好的球迷、這麼好的球員，是否可以將啟德主場館定為港足（中國香港足球隊）真主場？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：足總（中國香港足球總會）一直與啟德體育園商討，我們會盡量希望可以達成一個雙方都合理、雙方都有利的協議。政府亦會繼續支持中國香港隊和香港足球，包括港超聯（香港超級聯賽）。事實上，球場一直是個問題。康文署（康樂及文化事務署）過往每年大約預留127節供港超（聯球隊）作為主場或使用草地練習，今年已增加到252節。另外，以前康文署場地對於打氣，例如用鼓、擴音器有較多限制。現在大家都看到，球迷入場除了看場好賽事外，他們也很享受氣氛，我們也覺得這樣是很好的，我們也鼓勵球迷多點幫我們的球隊打氣，所以這個月（相關限制）又放寬了。接下來我們會繼續支持香港足球，也希望我們中國香港隊下一場在主場對新加坡時可以大獲全勝，那我們就很有機會出線了。

記者：剛才最緊張是哪個環節？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：我們幾乎可以2比0的，那球「笠射」我想只差一點而已。另外我們有球員被趕出場，兩黃一紅，心是沉一沉的，不過足球就是這樣。

記者：見到這樣好的球迷，有甚麼說話想對球迷和球員說？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：多謝球迷，還有請他們介紹我吃甚麼喉糖可以不聲沙的，多謝各位。"
Arrangements for 15th NG road cycling (men's individual) event (with photo/video),2025-10-14 22:30,2025-10-14 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400870.htm,"  The 15th National Games (NG) road cycling (men's individual) event will be held on November 8. A press conference hosted by the Head of the National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong) (NGCO), Mr Yeung Tak-keung,was held jointly with representatives of relevant government departments and the Cycling Association of Hong Kong, China today (October 14) to announce details of the event and the relevant arrangements, including temporary traffic control measures, clearance arrangements at the boundary control point (BCP), and emergency response and rescue arrangements.

 The road cycling (men's individual) event this year is the only event that spans over Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao in the 15th NG, and a tripartitetest event was held last November. In addition, a pre-event comprehensive drill was conducted on September 30 and the process was generally smooth. The official race covers a total distance of 231.8 kilometres, comprising a 55.8km section in Hong Kong. The race will enter Hong Kong from the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) and go through the Hong Kong Port, North Lantau Highway and Penny's Bay Highway. The athletes will return after passing by Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and head back to Zhuhai via the HZMB and Hengqin.

 The race is scheduled to start at 9am on November 8, and is expected to conclude at 2.30pm. The event will feature 25 representative teams from the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao, with a total of 104 athletes competing. It is anticipated that the race convoy will enter the Hong Kong section around 10.20am and spend about one and a half hours in the Hong Kong section.

 To facilitate better viewing experience, a public viewing zone will be set up on the footpath of Fantasy Road located outside the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, which can accommodate a few hundreds of spectators. Members of the public may come to cheer up the athletes and enjoy the race there. Implementation of crowd management measures will be made by the Police subject to conditions in the areas. Members of the public are advised to take heed of instructions of the Police and the staff on site. As temporary traffic control measures will be implemented on the race route at the North Lantau Highway, members of the public should take the MTR to the Disneyland Resort station as far as possible to reach the designated viewing zone. The Guangdong competition region has commissioned the China Central Television as the host broadcaster to provide live webcast of the event. All rights-holding broadcasters, including the three local free television broadcasters and Radio Television Hong Kong, will be conferred the live signal.

 To facilitate the holding of the race, temporarily control measures will be implemented on the HZMB Hong Kong Port, the HZMB and some roads on that day. Relevant arrangements are set out as below:

(1) Clearance service arrangement

 On the event day, temporary control measures will be implemented on the HZMB eastbound from Zhuhai/Macao towards Hong Kong from 9am to 12.30pm, and on the HZMB westbound from Hong Kong towards Zhuhai/Macao from 7.30am to 12.30pm. During the temporary control period, all vehicles are prohibited from using the HZMB. Special arrangements will be implemented on the departure clearance services. Travellers or vehicles wishing to leave Hong Kong for Zhuhai or Macao before the implementation of the temporary control measures are required to arrive at the Departure Hall of Passenger Clearance Building or Outbound Vehicle Clearance Plaza of the HZMB Hong Kong Port before 6.30am on the event day in order to undergo departure and clearance procedures. The Departure Hall of Passenger Clearance Building and Outbound Vehicle Clearance Plaza of the HZMB Hong Kong Port will be closed at 6.30am.

 The departure and clearance services at the HZMB Hong Kong Port will resume after 12.30pm on that day. It is expected that traffic will be busy. Travellers and drivers who plan to use the bridge on that day are advised to plan their trips in advance and pay attention to the traffic control arrangements within Zhuhai.

(2) Public transport arrangements

 Cross-boundary public transport services travelling on the HZMB between Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macao, including the HZMB shuttle bus (Gold Bus), cross-boundary coach and bus services of SkyPier Terminal Transfer Coach of Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA), will be suspended during the implementation of the temporary control on the HZMB Main Bridge and the HZMB Hong Kong Port on that day. As the roads within Zhuhai are still closed for the race until about 2.30pm, the Gold Bus from Hong Kong to Zhuhai is expected to provide limited service from 12.30pm to 1.30pm while the Gold Bus from Zhuhai to Hong Kong will resume service at 2.30pm. Meanwhile, Gold Bus services to/from Macao will resume at 12.30pm.

  In addition, during the temporary control period, local public transport services to and from the HZMB Hong Kong Port will implement temporary services adjustment, including airport bus A routes, shuttle bus B routes and Disneyland R routes. The A routes from the airport will not pass through the Hong Kong Port from 10am to 1pm and the A route from urban and New Territories to the airport will not pass through the Hong Kong Port from the first departure to 11.30am. The shuttle bus services B4 and B5 serving between Airport/Sunny Bay Station and HZMB Hong Kong port will be suspended during certain periods. Routes R8 and R33, serving between Disneyland and the Lantau Link Interchange and Tuen Mun Station will also be suspended for some periods. Meanwhile, to facilitate the smooth implementation of the event, Shun Long Road (both bounds) will be closed (see details under (3) below) and affected bus routes will be temporarily diverted. The bus companies will issue notices to inform affected passengers of the details of the above service adjustment.

 The Transport Department (TD) will notify affected operators of cross-boundary and local public transport services, while the Marine Department will liaise with cross-boundary ferry operators, to work out manpower and frequency arrangements. During the temporary control period, travellers should consider the use of land BCPs between Hong Kong and Shenzhen for their travel between Hong Kong and Zhuhai. They should also consider taking cross-boundary ferry services between Hong Kong and Macao.

 Booking for the time slot between 6am and noon for Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles will be suspended. Subject to on-site traffic management arrangements on the event day, motorists who have made reservations in the afternoon on that day will only be allowed to enter the Vehicle Clearance Plaza of the Hong Kong Port after the temporary traffic control measures are lifted (estimated to be after around 12.30pm).

 Regarding passenger bus services of SkyPier Terminal Transfer Coach of the HKIA, the services between the HKIA and Zhuhai and Macao Port, will be suspended during the temporary control period at the Hong Kong Port of the HZMB. The Airport Authority Hong Kong will maintain close communication with all service operators and continuously monitor the situation to implement timely adjustments as needed.

 In addition, the 15th NG road cycling (women's individual) event will be held on November 9. Though the race course will mainly be located in Zhuhai and will not affect the HZMB and clearance services at the port, some of the roads in Zhuhai will be closed due to the event. From 7.30am to 11.30am that day, only limited services for routes departing for Zhuhai will be provided by the Gold Bus. Members of the public are advised to avoid taking the Gold Bus to Zhuhai during the abovementioned periods. Moreover, some of the ferry services between Hong Kong and Zhuhai Jiuzhou Port will also be suspended on November 8 and 9.

(3) Road traffic control measures

 Temporary traffic control measures will be implemented on the North Lantau Highway and roads near the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort during the race period of Hong Kong section (exact time will depend on the actual progress of the race).

 Temporary traffic control measures will be implemented in the vicinity of the race route on the North Lantau Highway. The travel time to and from the airport via the North Lantau Highway is expected to increase by about 30 minutes. Members of the public and travellers who plan to travel to and from the airport should plan their trips in advance and allow sufficient travelling time. They are advised to use railway services, including the Airport Express, the Tung Chung line and the Disneyland Resort line, and avoid driving to the relevant area. Drivers who need to drive to the airport may consider using the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Tunnel.

 Temporary traffic control measures will be implemented on the race route near the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort during the race. Travelling time to and from the park, hotels and the Inspiration Lake Recreation Centre via Penny's Bay Highway, Sunny Bay Road, Magic Road and Fantasy Road may be increased by about 30 minutes due to the traffic control measures. Members of the public who plan to travel to the vicinity of the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort should consider using railway services as far as possible.

 In addition, as this road section connects to the North Lantau Highway, members of the public and travellers who need to travel between the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and the HKIA may also be affected by the temporary traffic control measures on the North Lantau Highway, and the travelling time required may be increased.

Shun Long Road (both bounds) will be closed starting from 6.30am and expected to reopen at about 2pm on that day after the related road section returns to normal. During the above road closure period, the TD will implement traffic diversion such that the original traffic of Shun Long Road (both bounds) will be diverted via Chek Lap Kok Island. The journey time is expected to increase by about 10 minutes. The bus companies will issue notices to inform passengers of the details of service adjustment.

 A spokesperson for the NGCO said as the NG is the country's highest-level event, this event has to meet stringent requirements in terms of the selection of race course and the organisational arrangements to ensure the safety of athletes. Relevant departments will work together to facilitate the special traffic and transportation arrangements to minimise the impact on the public and travellers who usually use the HZMB and other related road sections. Members of the public and travellers who need to travel to and from Zhuhai or Macao are urged to plan their itinerariesin advance, and use other control points and public transport as far as possible.The spokesperson thanked members of the public and travellers for their understanding, as well as the contributions of various organisations and departments to implementing the relevant arrangements."
​第十五屆全國運動會自行車（公路）賽（男子個人賽）安排（附圖／短片）,2025-10-14 22:30,2025-10-14 23:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400867.htm,"第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）自行車（公路）賽（男子個人賽）將於十一月八日舉行。全國運動會香港賽區統籌辦公室（全運會統籌辦）主任楊德強今日（十月十四日）聯同相關政府部門和中國香港單車總會代表舉行記者會，介紹賽事內容，以及臨時交通管制措施、口岸通關、應急救援及其他賽事相關安排。

今年的自行車（公路）賽（男子個人賽）是十五運會唯一橫跨粵港澳三個賽區的賽事，三地在去年十一月曾舉行測試賽，九月三十日亦進行了賽前綜合演練，過程大致順利。正式賽事賽道全程231.8公里，其中香港賽段為55.8公里，途經港珠澳大橋，然後前往香港口岸人工島、北大嶼山公路和竹篙灣公路，進入香港迪士尼樂園度假區後折返，再經港珠澳大橋前往橫琴，然後返回珠海。

賽事在十一月八日上午九時開始，預計下午二時三十分結束，屆時將有來自內地及港澳25支隊伍共104名運動員競逐獎項。預計車隊在上午約十時二十分進入香港段，並在香港段作賽約一個半小時。

為方便公眾觀賞賽事，香港迪士尼樂園度假區以外的幻想道行人路將設公眾觀賞區，可容納約數百名觀眾，市民可到場觀賽和為運動員打氣。警方會視乎現場情況，適時實施人流管制措施，請市民聽從現場警方及工作人員指示。由於北大嶼山公路的賽道路段將實施臨時交通管制措施，市民應盡量乘搭港鐵到迪士尼站再步行前往指定觀賞區。廣東賽區已委託主廣播機構中央電視台直播相關賽事，所有持權媒體，包括香港三間免費電視台和香港電台，均可取得直播訊號。

為配合賽事進行，當日港珠澳大橋香港口岸、大橋以及部分道路需要實施臨時管控措施，有關安排詳列如下：

（一）通關安排

賽事當日，港珠澳大橋東行由珠海／澳門往香港方向，由上午九時至下午十二時三十分實施臨時管控；而港珠澳大橋西行由香港往珠海／澳門方向，則由上午七時三十分至下午十二時三十分實施臨時管控。臨時管控期間，所有車輛禁止使用大橋，離境的通關服務將有特別安排。若有旅客或車輛計劃於臨時管控措施實施前離港前往珠海或澳門，他們必須於當日早上六時三十分前抵達港珠澳大橋香港口岸旅檢大樓出境大堂或出境車輛通關廣場，以辦理離境及通關手續。香港口岸旅檢大樓出境大堂及出境車輛通關廣場將於上午六時三十分關閉。

港珠澳大橋香港口岸的離境通關服務預計於當日下午十二時三十分後恢復正常運作，屆時預計交通將會較為繁忙，計劃於當日使用大橋的旅客及司機請預早規劃行程，並留意珠海市內交通管制的安排。

（二）公共交通運輸安排

當日港珠澳大橋主橋及香港口岸實施臨時管控期間，經港珠澳大橋來往香港與珠海及澳門的跨境公共運輸服務，包括港珠澳大橋穿梭巴士（金巴）、跨境直通巴士及香港國際機場海天中轉大樓的客車服務將會暫停。由於珠海市內的道路因比賽仍然封閉直至下午約二時三十分，香港往珠海的金巴介乎下午十二時三十分至一時三十分將提供有限度服務，而珠海往香港的金巴將於下午二時三十分恢復服務。另外，來往香港與澳門之間的金巴將於下午十二時三十分恢復服務。

此外，在實施臨時管控期間，來往港珠澳大橋香港口岸的本地公共運輸服務，包括機場巴士「A」線、接駁巴士路線「B」線及接駁迪士尼樂園的「R」線，將會實施臨時服務調整，當中由機場開出的「A」線由上午十時至下午一時期間暫停途經香港口岸。而由市區及新界前往機場的「A」線會由首班車至上午十一時三十分暫停途經香港口岸。接駁巴士來往港珠澳大橋香港口岸與機場／欣澳站的第B4及B5號線則會於部分時間暫停服務，而接駁迪士尼樂園與青嶼幹線轉車站及屯門站的第R8及R33號線亦會於部分時間暫停服務。另外，為確保賽事順利進行，順朗路（來回方向）將會封閉，詳見下文（三），受影響的巴士路線需臨時改道。巴士公司會張貼通告通知受影響乘客有關服務調整的詳情。

運輸署將通知受影響的跨境及本地公共運輸服務營辦商，海事處亦會聯絡跨境渡輪營運商，以制訂人手及班次安排。在實施臨時管控期間，旅客可使用香港與深圳之間的陸路口岸來往香港與珠海，亦可考慮乘搭跨境渡輪服務來往香港與澳門。

當天上午六時至中午十二時的「港車北上」預約申請將會暫停。視乎當日實際交通管控安排，預約當天下午時段「港車北上」的駕駛人士於臨時管控結束後（預計於下午約十二時三十分後）方可進入香港口岸出境車輛通關廣場。

香港國際機場海天中轉大樓的客車服務方面，當日來往香港國際機場、珠海口岸和澳門口岸的客車服務會在港珠澳大橋香港口岸實施臨時管控期間暫停。香港機場管理局將與各服務營辦商保持緊密聯繫，並根據最新情況檢視及調整安排。

另外，十五運會自行車（公路）賽（女子個人賽）將於十一月九日舉行，雖然比賽路線主要涉及珠海市內，不影響港珠澳大橋及口岸通關服務，但由於賽事關係，珠海市內部分道路將會封閉，在當日上午七時三十分至十一時三十分期間，金巴往珠海只能夠提供有限度服務，建議市民避免在上述時段乘坐金巴前往珠海。此外，香港與珠海九洲港十一月八日和九日部分渡輪航班亦會暫停。

（三）道路管制安排

位於北大嶼山公路及香港迪士尼樂園度假區及附近道路的賽道路段，將於香港段比賽期間實施滾動式臨時交通管制措施（確實時間將視乎賽事的實際進程）。

位於北大嶼山公路的賽道路段當日將實施滾動式臨時交通管制措施，屆時，經北大嶼山公路來往機場的行車時間預計需要增加約30分鐘。計劃往返機場的市民和旅客應預早計劃行程，預留充裕交通時間，盡量使用鐵路服務，包括機場快綫、東涌綫及迪士尼綫，避免駕駛車輛前往有關路段。如出行人士需駕車前往機場，應考慮使用屯門─赤鱲角隧道進出機場。

位於香港迪士尼樂園度假區附近道路的賽道路段，將於賽事進行期間實施臨時交通管制措施。屆時，經竹篙灣公路、欣澳道、神奇道及幻想道來往樂園、酒店及迪欣湖活動中心的行車時間，或因交通管制措施而增加約30分鐘。計劃前往香港迪士尼樂園度假區一帶的市民，應考慮盡量使用鐵路服務。

此外，由於此路段連接北大嶼山公路，因此需要來往香港迪士尼樂園度假區及香港國際機場的市民及旅客，亦有機會受北大嶼山公路的臨時交通管制措施影響，增加所需行車時間。

順朗路（來回方向）將於當日上午六時三十分開始封閉，並預計約下午二時還原有關路段後重開。在上述封路期間，運輸署將實施交通改道，原本行駛順朗路（來回方向）的車輛需要改經赤鱲角島，行車時間預計需要增加約10分鐘。巴士公司將張貼通告，通知乘客有關服務調整的詳情。

全運會統籌辦發言人表示，全國運動會是國家最高水平賽事，本次賽事在選擇賽道和組織安排上，需符合嚴格要求，以保障運動員安全。相關部門會合力做好特別交通運輸安排，以減低對平常使用港珠澳大橋和其他相關路段的市民和旅客的影響。發言人呼籲當日需要往返珠海和澳門的市民及旅客，及早計劃行程，並盡量使用其他口岸和公共交通。發言人感謝市民及旅客的體諒，以及有關機構及各部門齊心協力落實相關安排。"

SED leads Mainland study tour for students of senior secondary subject of Citizenship and Social Development to visit Chongqing (with photos),2025-10-14 20:45,2025-10-14 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400734.htm,"The Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, together with more than 100 secondary students and teachers joining the first ""Mainland Study Tour for the Three Gorges Culture and Urban Development in Chongqing"" of the senior secondary subject of Citizenship and Social Development (CS) in 2025/26, attended the kick-off ceremony of the tour in Chongqing today (October 14).

Addressing the ceremony, Dr Choi said that since April 2023, with the assistance of various Mainland provinces and municipalities, the Education Bureau (EDB) has arranged for more than 140 000 students to participate in the CS Mainland study tours. She expressed hope that these ""classrooms on the move"" will inspire students' curiosity, enabling them to constantly explore new knowledge and reflect on what they have learned through immersive learning experiences.

She thanked the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, the Ministry of Education, the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission for their thoughtful arrangements, enabling students to gain a deeper understanding of Chongqing's urban development. Students were also offered an opportunity to visit wartime relics in this year of the 80th anniversary of victory in the War of Resistance, commemoratingthe fallen heroes in defence of the nation and reflecting on the importance of peace.

At the same time, Dr Choi signed a Memorandum of Understanding on education co-operation between Chongqing and Hong Kong with representatives of the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission. She also witnessed the pairing up of Clementi Secondary School and Chongqing Yucai Secondary School as sister schools.

Yesterday (October 13) and today, Dr Choi and the delegation watched ""Chongqing 1949"", a historical drama, and visited the Chongqing Historic Sites Museum of the War of Resistance Against Japan to learn more about wartime history.

To optimise the learning outcomes of the CS Mainland study tours, the EDB held a seminar on the tours in the morning with representatives from all the 11 participating provinces and cities to summarise work experiences and strengthen collaboration and exchanges. At the seminar, representatives from participating provinces and cities were enthusiastic to share their experiences and views, helping enrich the content of future study tours and provide students with excellent learning experiences.

Yesterday and today, Dr Choi visited Chongqing University and Chongqing Jiaotong University respectively. She said that higher education institutions in Hong Kong and Chongqing have been conducting professional exchanges through various means. Co-operation covers talent cultivation, student admissions and employment, and scientific research. The EDB will continue to support exchanges and co-operation between higher education institutions in the two places to nurture talent for the country's development.

Dr Choi also met with Hong Kong students in Chongqing to learn about their studies and daily life. She said that Hong Kong students living in Chongqing have the opportunities to gain more in-depth knowledge about the country's developments and cultivate affection for the country. She encouraged them to seize the learning opportunities and contribute to the country's high-quality development.

Addressing the ceremony, Dr Choi said that since April 2023, with the assistance of various Mainland provinces and municipalities, the Education Bureau (EDB) has arranged for more than 140 000 students to participate in the CS Mainland study tours. She expressed hope that these ""classrooms on the move"" will inspire students' curiosity, enabling them to constantly explore new knowledge and reflect on what they have learned through immersive learning experiences.

She thanked the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, the Ministry of Education, the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission for their thoughtful arrangements, enabling students to gain a deeper understanding of Chongqing's urban development.

To optimise the learning outcomes of the CS Mainland study tours, the EDB held a seminar on the tours in the morning with representatives from all the 11 participating provinces and cities to summarise work experiences and strengthen collaboration and exchanges. At the seminar, representatives from participating provinces and cities were enthusiastic to share their experiences and views, helping enrich the content of future study tours and provide students with excellent learning experiences.

Yesterday and today, Dr Choi visited Chongqing University and Chongqing Jiaotong University respectively. She said that higher education institutions in Hong Kong and Chongqing have been conducting professional exchanges through various means. Co-operation covers talent cultivation, student admissions and employment, and scientific research. The EDB will continue to support exchanges and co-operation between higher education institutions in the two places to nurture talent for the country's development.

About 50 business people from both delegations attended the seminar.

  In her welcome remarks, the Director-General of the HKETO Jakarta, Miss Libera Cheng, said that ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" proposed supporting Hong Kong small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups in exploring overseas markets. It also proposed to establish the ""Economic and Trade Express"" by joining forces of ETOs, the overseas offices of Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council to form a functional platform to enhance synergy and capitalise on their complementary advantages to help Hong Kong enterprises to ""go global"". She encouraged Hong Kong enterprises to leverage the visit to actively explore Indonesia's market potential and identify business opportunities.

  On the same day, the HKETO Jakarta also co-organised with the Indonesia Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (InachamHK) a networking dinner that brought together around 80 guests from the two delegations and several major Indonesian business chambers.

Immigration Department arrests 16 persons during operations targeting foreign domestic helpers who breach conditions of stay (with photos),2025-10-14 20:03,2025-10-14 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400694.htm,"The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Swordfish"", for three consecutive days from October 12 to 14, targeting foreign domestic helpers who breached their conditions of stay. A total of 16 persons, including ten suspected illegal workers and six suspected employers, were arrested.

During the operation, ImmD investigators raided 26 target locations including restaurants, guesthouses, retail stores and commercial buildings. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised ten women, aged 26 to 43. Among them, five persons were current helpers, three persons were overstaying ex-helpers, one person was visitor and one person was found to be an imported worker. ImmD investigators found most of the suspected illegal workers at restaurants or guesthouses performing dishwashing, cleaning, etc. Meanwhile, six suspected employers, comprising five men and one woman, aged 41 to 63.

""A helper should only perform domestic duties for the employer as listed in the ""Schedule of Accommodation and Domestic Duties"" attached to the Contract. The helper should not take up any other employment, including part-time domestic duties, with any other person. The employer should not require or allow the helper to carry out any work for any other person,"" an ImmD spokesman said.

The spokesman also said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him/her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

In addition, the spokesman warned that, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment.""

The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter, temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."
入境處打擊外傭違反逗留條件　共拘十六人（附圖）,2025-10-14 20:02,2025-10-14 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400695.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十月十二日至今日（十月十四日）一連三日在全港各區展開代號「劍魚」的反非法勞工行動。在該項打擊外籍家庭傭工（外傭）在港違反逗留條件的行動中，入境處共拘捕16名人士，包括十名懷疑非法勞工及六名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的人士。

行動中，入境處人員一共搜查了26個目標地點，包括餐廳、賓館、零售店舖及商業大廈等。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為十名女子，年齡介乎26至43歲。當中五名為現職外傭、三名為逾期逗留的前外傭、一名訪客、以及一名輸入勞工。被捕的非法勞工主要在餐廳及賓館從事洗碗及清潔等工作。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的六名人士為五男一女，年齡介乎41至63歲。

入境處發言人說：「外傭只能根據合約附錄的「住宿及家務安排」為僱主料理家務。外傭不得受僱於其他人士擔任任何職務，包括兼職家務工作。僱主亦不得要求或容許傭工為其他人士擔任任何工作。」

入境處發言人強調：「任何人違反對他／她有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

此外，入境處發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰會由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外傭）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

The total estimated market value was about $1.4 million and the duty potential was about $880,000. Four men, aged between 28 and 58, were arrested and two private cars involved in the cases were also seized.

Based on risk assessment and intelligence analysis, Customs and police officers intercepted two inbound private cars at the HZMB Hong Kong Port yesterday. Upon inspection of the first private car, Customs officers seized about 130 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes from the front and rear passenger seats, the boot and hollow spaces of the vehicle. A 36-year-old male driver and a 28-year-old male passenger were arrested. Subsequently, Customs officers seized about 140 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes with a similar concealment in the second private car.

The four arrested men have each been charged with one count of importing goods to which the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) applies. The cases will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (October 15).

Members of the public are reminded that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Customs will continue to take stringent enforcement action to combat cross-boundary smuggling activities.

立法會財務委員會及其轄下兩個小組委員會各主席於年結記者會上的發言全文（只有中文）,2025-10-14 19:21,2025-10-14 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400673.htm,"下稿代立法會秘書處發出：

以下是立法會財務委員會（財委會）主席陳振英、人事編制小組委員會主席易志明和工務小組委員會主席謝偉銓今日（十月十四日）舉行年結記者會的發言全文：

財委會主席陳振英：

歡迎大家出席財委會與兩個小組委員會聯合舉行的簡報會。我會首先匯報財委會的工作，然後兩個小組委員會的主席會分別報告小組委員會的工‍作。

今個會期財委會運作暢順，委員繼續嚴謹認真、理性務實地審批政府的撥款建議，做好把關。截至今年十月三日，即財委會今個會期最後一次會議，獲財委會批准的項目有67項，合共涉及的承擔額約為1,268億元，政府提交的所有項目均已完成審議，包括：

（一）20項人事編制及28項工務工程撥款建議；以及

（二）19項非工務工程撥款建議，涉及承擔額約186億元，包括「創科產業引導基金」（100億元）、「前沿科技研究支援計劃」（30億元）等。

在今個會期，財委會合共舉行了35次會議，總時數約71小時41分鐘。就需要討論的撥款項目，項目的平均審議時間約為1小時29分鐘。部分較受關注的項目，例如香港中文大學醫院發展計劃貸款的安排，以及「創科產業引導基金」相關撥款建議，財委會用了較長時間討論，分別用了約3小時及2小時審議有關建議。我想重申，不能單以財委會會議時數來衡量立法會審議撥款建議的工作，而是要計及申請相關撥款的整個流程，包括諮詢相關事務委員會等。

財委會在今年四月舉行了21個環節共約34小時的特別會議，審核二○二五至二○二六年度的開支預算。88位議員就開支預算的內容提出合共約3 900條書面問題。在特別會議上，議員進一步就開支項目請官員提供資料，並就預算案內各項與公共開支相關的措施提出意見。議員關注到，多個政策局在回覆議員的書面問題時，不少都表示沒有備存相關數據或資料，部分答覆內容亦流於籠統。我期望政府參考議員的建議，加強數據收集和分析的工作，此舉不但有助政府回答議員提問，更能以客觀數據為依據，按科學方法制訂更精準到位的政策及措施。

在政府提交財委會審議的48項人事編制和工務工程建議中，財委會曾進一步討論的有四項，當中三項是小組委員會建議進一步討論。有一項建議是小組委員會不建議財委會進一步討論，但其後有財委會委員聯名要求討論並獲委員會同意，這個項目就是重置域多利亞公眾殮房建造工程。多名委員在會議上就項目設計、空間運用、工程價格等多方面事宜提問，例如善用地下岩洞會否反而增加工程成本、如何運用地面和岩洞的空間才更具成本效益。當中帶出了一個重要的信息，就是委員經常強調，就是當局應提前在選址階段加入成本控制的概念，考慮不同地點對工程成本的影響，並在討論文件提供不同方案的比較資料，讓議員審議財務建議時有多角度的考慮。

香港現時面對財赤，在「財政彈藥」不多的情況下，議員一方面「急市民所急」，協助政府「應慳則慳」，同時確保政府「應使則使」，在有需要的範疇投放足夠資源，做到「拼經濟、謀發展、惠民生」。「開源」和「節流」同樣重要，我們不能只着眼赤字規模，而一味縮減開支，更重要是在現時經濟轉型期，發掘新增長點，同時善用現有資源，推動經濟增長。所謂危中有機，建議當局全面檢討理財方式，優化財政資源配置，為經濟發展注入動力。

現屆政府敢於破局，積極整合財政、開源節流，例如向財委會申請將六個規模較大的種子基金未來五年不需要動用的約620億元結餘，回撥至政府帳目，以及檢視各項計劃的財政承擔額，包括將購置社福處所已核准的承擔額下調。有關做法將公共財政資源「解鎖」，讓政府可以更靈活和有效地運用公共資源。委員都認同這個方向，並促請政府盡快檢視其他種子基金的運作模式，以及增加基金收支細項的透明度，令議員和公眾更掌握基金的運作詳情。

立法會支持香港特別行政區（特區）政府推動創科發展，而本地科研轉化為經濟成果初見成效。香港在世界數碼競爭力的科技排名世界第三，《2025年全球創新指數》世界百強科技集群「深圳—香港—廣州」集群排名第一。為抓緊科技創新的發展勢頭及機遇，完善創科建設策略布局，財委會在今個年度繼續「加碼」，批出多個與科研有關的撥款建議，合計超過140億元，包括「創科產業引導基金」（100億元）、「前沿科技研究支援計劃」（30億元）、設立香港人工智能研發院（10億元）等。

值得一提的是創科產業引導基金，政府會以有限合夥人的形式參與基金運作，引導市場資金投資指定策略性新興和未來產業；標誌着政府革新投資創新及科技產業的思路，亦是對接國家發展「耐心資本」的戰略，進一步推動「政、產、學、研、投」的高效協作。這個項目上百億元，委員在審議撥款建議時都「慎之又慎」，全方位就資本回報率、行政費、監察及退出機制等事宜提問。我希望政府在推行有關計劃時，考慮委員的意見和建議，「打好這手牌」，確保基金達到預期的回報。

另一方面，在今個會期，各部門為推動智慧城市建設，相繼向財委會提交多項有關優化資訊科技設施的撥款建議，合計獲撥款超過44億元，包括為香港警務處開發新一代通訊系統（約20億元），優化皇崗口岸電腦系統（約9.5億元）、更換或更新策略性道路的交通管制及監察系統（約5.7億元）等。

現在我請兩位小組委員會主席向大家匯報。先請人事編制小組委員會主席易志明。

人事編制小組委員會主席易志明：

各位傳媒朋友，很高興今日在此向大家匯報人事編制小組委員會在二○二五年會期的工作。

小組委員會在今個會期共審議並通過了18項人事編制建議，均已獲財委會批‍准，這些建議涉及多個民生項目，亦涉及土地供應、「搶人才」、保護關鍵基礎設施、鞏固提升香港國際金融中心地位等相關政策落實，助力香港拼經濟、謀發展。

涉及的首長級職位包括：

（一）開設一個常額職位，設於關鍵基礎設施（電腦系統安全）專責辦公室，負責保護關鍵基礎設施的電腦系統和網絡安全，以及制訂相關《實務守則》；

（二）刪除兩個常額職位，即設於香港金融管理局的兩個助理銀行監理專員職位；

（三）開設四個有時限職位，包括設於土木工程拓展署的一個有時限職位，負責南拓展及可持續大嶼辦事處的工作；設於關鍵基礎設施（電腦系統安全）專責辦公室的兩個有時限職位，負責實施各項與保護關鍵基礎設施安全相關的工作；以及設於食物環境衞生署，負責監督私營骨灰安置所及市政基建規劃的一個有時限職位；

（四）保留18個有時限職位，例如財經事務及庫務局的兩個有時限職位，負責推動公司註冊制度、會計專業及金融科技的工作，以及勞工及福利局的三個有時限職位，負責招攬和支援人才、人力規劃及研究的工作；以‍及

（五）將一個非公務員常設職位轉為公務員常設職位，該職位設於教育署，負責推動香港教育更高質量發展，為國家建設「教育強國」的目標作出貢獻。

今個會期，小組委員會共召開了10次會議，總時數約18.3小時，每個項目的審議時數平均約一小時。每個項目都先經相關事務委員會討論政策事宜，才交上小組委員會，經小組委員會通過後再交上財委會，整個討論過程相當認真和深入。

我觀察到，委員在討論人事編制建議時，提問內容精準到位，聚焦於建議開設或保留職位的理據、有關職位的性質、所屬職級、開設年期、分工安排，以及績效指標等細節，這些問題都是公眾最為關注的。委員在審議開設新職位的建議時，都會詳‍細審視有關職位是否有必要，以及可否透過內‍部調配代替增‍聘人手等，以確保政府恪守審‍慎理財、財政資源用得其所，以及公務員編制零增長的原‍則。當局亦有針對委員的提問作具體回應。

另外，委員讚賞一些部門主動積極，例如提前騰空不予保留的有時限職位，盡快幫政府「慳荷包」，以及「應慳則慳」，暫緩開設若干職位，改以內部調配替代。

本年度是本屆立法會最後一個會期。回顧第七屆立法會四年會期，小組委員會審議並通過62項人事編制建議，均獲財委會批准。我寄望下屆立法會的人事編制小組委員會，繼續以專業、嚴謹和高效的態度，全面審視政府提出的人事編制建議，確保資源配置公平，並發揮最大效益。

人力資源是推動社會進步與經濟發展的重要動能，亦是實現香港長遠發展及提升競爭力的關鍵因素。小組委員會要以創新的視角，積極應對未來社會變遷帶來的挑戰，持續優化公共服務隊伍、為香港的可持續發展奠定堅實基礎、為市民提供更優質高效的公共服務，確保政府政策得以有效執行。

最後，我想特別感謝副主席陳祖恒。這段時間，我們並肩合作、互相支持，齊心推動小組委員會的工作。多得副主席的投入和幫忙，很多事情才能順利完成。多謝各位。

財委會主席陳振英：

謝謝易志明，現在請工務小組委員會主席謝偉銓。

工務小組委員會主席謝偉銓：

各位傳媒朋友，很高興今日在此和大‍家分享工‍務小組委員會在二○二五年會期的工作。

先講講一些數字，今個會期，工務小‍組委員會共舉行了17次會議，總時數超過36小時，包括應政‍府要求而加開了七次會議，共約16小時。小組委員會共審議了28項工務工程撥‍款建議，總‍撥款額達1,082億元，全部建議已‍獲財委會批准。

這28項工務工程，當中約311億元，即近三成的撥款額，是用於北部都會區（北都）的基礎設施工程，包括元朗南新發展區第二期發展的工地平整及基礎設施工程（約138億元）、洪水橋淨水設施（約67億元）、牛潭尾濾水廠擴展工程（約96億元）及新界北區食水供應改善工程（約10億元）。顯示立法會充分配合當局推動北都提速發展；另有約28%的工務工程撥款額，是與環境政策相關，涉及款項約305億‍元。

每項工務工程撥款建議平均審議‍時間約為1小時19分鐘，其中較受公眾關注的撥款建議，例‍如涉及超過一萬個有利社會民生的小型工程項目、撥款額416億元的二○二五至二○二六年度基本工程儲備基金整體撥款；以及造價12億元的重置域多利亞公眾殮房項目，小組委員會均用了超過兩小時深入討論。

小組委員會為市民嚴謹把關，監察政府的工務工程支出。委員亦見到政府努力壓縮工程成本。以搬遷沙田污水處理廠往岩洞的餘下工程為例，去年七月諮詢發展事務委員會時，項目預算超過156億元，在今年六月提交予工務小組委員會審議時，預算約為129億3,000萬元，減少了約27億元。當中做了不少工作，包括渠務署就機電工程合約採用「直接採購」模式，由政府直接採購合適的大型機電設備。與傳統的「連工包料」模式相比，有助節省約17億元，是委員在這方面和政府努力所減省。

委員留意到現時每個工務工程項目均會預留相等於有關工程估計費用的10%作應急費用，關注此「一刀切」的做法是否恰當，會否不必要地凍結了政府的財政資源，因此委員促請當局研究，可否因應項目的規模和性質，設定不同應急費用百分比上限。委員亦注意到，政府現時委託房委會推展工務工程，需支付相當於工程費用12.5%的間接費用。委員建議政府檢討有關間接費用有沒有下調空間，從而降低工程的預算費。

因應委員的意見，發展局與財經事務及庫務局正檢討現行工務工程項目的資源運用機制，包括有關應急費用機制，以及就推展工務工程支付予不同機構，例如香港鐵路有限公司、醫院管理局、香港房屋委員會等的間接費用的百分比。我期望當局在不久的將來與議會分享有關檢討結果。

立法會不同委員會在公共財政及審批撥款上扮演不同角色。當項目經過相關事務委員會討論後，來到工務小組委員會則聚焦工程事宜，我留意到委員都是積極務‍實地參與討論，反映地區人士及市民大眾的關注和期望。在第‍七‍屆立法會的四個會期內，小‍組委員會合共通過121‍項工務工程撥‍款建議，總撥款額達5,237‍億元。

政府持續投資基本工程，致力改善市民生活質素、推動香港經濟發展和提升香港長遠競爭力。但建造業面對建造成本高昂、人力短缺等挑戰，市民亦關注工務工程項目開支情況。鑑於當前本港經濟和公共財政狀況，有議員認為政府應檢視現有的工務工程項目清單，審時度勢，按緩急輕重有序落實各個項目；政府亦應維持每年工務工程的投入總規模，防止（工程量）大起大落的情況出現。行政長官於二○二五年《施政報告》中提到，政府原訂未來五年的基本工程開支每年平均約為1,200億元沒有改變，並提出額外預留300億元，在未來兩至三年加大工程項目開支，議員樂見政府支持本地建造業和持續推動經濟發展。

以上就是我跟大家分享有關工務小組委員會在今‍個會期的工作。最後，我藉此機會感謝副‍主‍席陳恒鑌，我們「拍住上」，一同做好小組委員會的每項工作。現在我將時間交給財委會主席。

財委會主席陳振英：

現在由我作一個總結。今個會期，財委會和兩個小組委員會繼續妥善履行審批政府撥款建議的職能，審議過程嚴謹、審慎和有效率，適時批准所需撥款，配合政府致力落實各項振興經濟的政策措施。回望第七屆立法會的四個年頭，財委會批准的財務建議合共261項，撥款總額達6,972億元，當中不少撥款建議都是助力擴充經濟容量和加強香港競爭力，以及對接國家發展戰略。最新一份《施政報告》亦提出了一系列經濟政策和措施，相信未來財委會審議的撥款建議，會繼續以推動經濟轉型為重點。

近年香港經歷了不少挑戰，特別是國際地緣政局干擾貿易和投資市場，不但考驗香港經濟的韌力，亦考驗政府的管治及理財能力，同時考驗財委會如何在保持公共財政穩健的前提下，謹慎和適度審批撥款，為社會及經濟創造價值。

我寄語下屆財委會及兩個小組委員會，除了一如既往繼續把關，代表市民「睇實個荷包」，亦要與時並進，用創新思維、新角度審視政府的財務建議，為建構公共財政和經濟的新格局出一分力。

我亦期望特區政府繼續秉持「取之有度，用之有節」的原則，謹慎理財，恪守節度，善用每分資源，把公帑花在最需要的地方，既保障民生，也提升服務，讓市民能真正受惠。

最後，本屆立法會已接近尾聲，我在此要感謝副主席周浩鼎就財委會的運作提供意見及協助主持部分會議。我亦感謝易志明及謝偉銓兩位主席，以及陳祖恒及陳恒鑌兩位副主席，帶領兩個小組委員會，協助財委會審議撥款建議。此外，我亦感謝法律顧問和其他立法會秘書處同事為委員會繁重的工作提供專業支援。多謝大家。"

一名二十六歲的男旅客及一名二十二歲的女旅客當日從泰國曼谷飛抵本港。海關人員清關時，在其各自的手提行李內發現該批偽裝成食品的懷疑大麻花，遂把二人拘捕。

跟進調查後，海關人員在同日於機場再拘捕一名三十二歲同樣由泰國曼谷抵港的懷疑涉案女旅客。

經調查後，涉案的三名被捕人士已共同被控以一項販運危險藥物罪，案件將於明日（十月十五日）在西九龍裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。

海關會繼續根據風險管理的原則，重點揀選來自高風險地區的旅客作清關檢查，這確保有效打擊跨境販毒活動。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑販毒活動。"
Hong Kong Customs detects drug trafficking case involving incoming passengers at airport (with photo),2025-10-14 19:00,2025-10-14 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400521.htm,"Hong Kong Customs detected a drug trafficking case involving three incoming passengers at Hong Kong International Airport on October 12 and seized about 14 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with an estimated market value of about $3 million.

A 26-year-old male passenger and a 22-year-old female passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, on that day. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds disguised as food in their respective carry-on luggage. They were subsequently arrested.

After a follow-up investigation, Customs officers further arrested a 32-year-old female passenger, who was also arriving from Bangkok, Thailand, and suspected to be connected with the case, at the airport on the same day.

After an investigation, the three persons involved in the case have been jointly charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (October 15).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-14 18:38,2025-10-14 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400677.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月十四日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新個案資料

首宗個案涉及一名28歲男子，住所位於九龍城區。初步調查顯示，他於十月六日至九日到訪廣東省中山市。他於十月十二日出現關節痛，翌日（十月十三日）出現發燒，同日到廣華醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

他有一名家居接觸者，曾於相若時間到中山市，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

另一宗個案涉及一名47歲男子，住所位於九龍城區。初步調查顯示，他於十月五日至七日獨自到訪廣東省江門市。他於十月十三日出現發燒、皮疹和關節痛，同日到廣華醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

他有一名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於上述兩名病人於潛伏期身處廣東省，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得35宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（十月五日至十一日）廣東省新增2 257宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與過去兩周分別3 181宗（九月二十八日至十月四日）及3 153宗(九月二十一日至二十七日）有所下降。上周大部分個案（1 255宗）在江門市錄得，其次為廣州（201宗）及佛山（196宗），全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。近期江門市基孔肯雅熱疫情呈波動下降趨勢，但仍在較高水平。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：

在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-14 18:38,2025-10-14 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400679.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 14), two new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

  The first case involves a 28-year-old male living in Kowloon City District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Zhongshan in Guangdong between October 6 and 9. He developed joint pain on October 12 and a fever on the following day (October 13). He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment on the same day. He is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing.

  The patient has one household contact, who visited Zhongshan around the same time. His household contact is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

  The other case involves a 47-year-old male living in Kowloon City District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Jiangmen in Guangdong alone between October 5 and 7. He developed a fever, rash and joint pain on October 13. He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment on the same day. He is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing.

  The patient has one household contact, who is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

  Since the two patients stayed in Guangdong Province during their incubation periods, the CHP considered that they were infected during travel. The cases were classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the cases to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 35 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 2 257 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (October 5 to 11), showing a decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 3 181 cases (September 28 to October 4) and 3 153 cases (September 21 to 27) respectively. Most of the cases (1 255 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen last week, followed by Guangzhou (201 cases) and Foshan (196 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the number of CF cases in Jiangmen has fluctuated downward recently, the level remained relatively high.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

  â
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
  ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

​勞工及福利局局長為第二十四屆香港職業安全健康大奬分享會暨頒獎典禮主禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-10-14 18:10,2025-10-14 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400672.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十月十四日）下午為第二十四屆香港職業安全健康大奬分享會暨頒獎典禮主禮的致辭全文：

林楚賢教授（職業安全健康局（職安局）副主席）、許處長（勞工處處長許澤森）、柱哥（勞工顧問委員會僱主代表、香港中華總商會永遠榮譽會長何世柱）、沛良（立法會議員陳沛良）、小松（立法會議員兼港九勞工社團聯會秘書長周小松）、Bonnie（職業安全健康局總幹事游雯）：

大家好！好高興再次出席香港職業安全健康大奬分享會暨頒獎典禮。這項由職業安全健康局及勞工處聯同多個政府部門、機構、商會及工會合辦的年度盛事，活動舉辦得一年比一年好。剛剛的短片時間雖短，但讓人有金像獎的感覺，頒獎禮不經不覺已經辦了20幾年，凝聚了無數單位的力量，共同推廣職安健文化，並獲得業界廣泛支持。今年比賽一如以往反應非常熱烈，共收到近1 200個參賽申請，競逐九個獎項類別。這背後代表的不單單是數字，而是整個社會和業界對建立更安全、更健康職安健文化的決心。

特區政府一直十分關注各行業工友的工作安全及健康，並持續與各界攜手合作，致力提升整體職安健表現。過去數年，香港職安健的總體情況持續有進步，但每年工業意外的致命個案仍然超過20宗，顯示我們仍需齊心合力加把勁，持續加強保障每位工友的生命安全。

勞工處一向高度重視職安健情況，針對問題痛點，按風險為本原則靈活調整策略，展開精準的巡查執法、宣傳推廣及教育培訓，同時積極配合發展局推動建造業善用創新科技，持續完善工作守則及指引，目標以多管齊下的方法打出「組合拳」，積極推動職安健文化，預防意外發生，全面提升香港職安健水平。

隨着智慧科技迅速發展，人工智能（AI）已廣泛應用於職安健領域，有助提前識別潛在風險，目標亦是保障工友的安全。今年初，勞工處已發布經修訂的《預防被貨車尾板夾傷的危害安全指引》（《指引》），如果大家從事這個行業應該知道，尾板安全時常出現問題，有了這個《指引》後，我認為大大提升了於尾板工作的安全性，《指引》明確接納使用AI技術的觸覺式裝置，提升尾板運作安全性，在這裏要多謝同事與業界商討，經歷包括我在內的多任處長，這絕對是一個很重要的里程碑。另外，勞工處亦樂見部分承建商嘗試引入遙距操控天秤系統，我對此十分期待。操作員可以從地下像操作遊戲機一樣來操控天秤，無需進行高空作業，這件事是功德無量的。我期待業界嘗試運用系統後，證明系統是可行的，政府會全力配合，令未來年輕人多一條出路，擅於玩遊戲機的可以操作天秤，重要是可以改善這行業的職安健，除降低作業風險外，對身體健康亦有幫助，因為高空作業未必能隨時上冼手間，進食亦要在高空中，政府會努力進行這方面的工作。

同時，勞工處同事十分有創新精神，他們本月開始正式使用小型無人機，應用科技強化巡查。若有僱主欲藉詞違規，我先把話說清楚，不要以為沒有勞工處的同事在場就無人監管，天上是有無人機的。我們已進行測試，效果十分滿意，所以應用無人機的技術是能大大提升我們巡查的效率、以及蒐證能力，令違規行為無所遁形。明年，我們將與職安局合辦第二屆職安健創新及科技博覽，第一屆十分成功，令我更期待第二屆的舉行，除展示我們正使用的技術，亦能彰顯香港的科技創新，通過這個博覽凝聚各界，令大家用好科技提升職安健。

提升香港的職安健水平是大家共同的責任，這句說話雖然老土，但永遠都是對的，即需要政府、僱主、僱員及各持責者一起以團隊精神將職安健做好，時刻不能鬆懈，希望能攜手，經過日積月累的努力，有一日我們能慢慢地改變職安健文化，繼而進一步提升職安健的水平。今日的頒獎典禮見證了所有卓越機構努力的成果，更展現了香港各界對職安健的決心與承諾。讓我們攜手推動創新、用心守護每一位工友，為香港建立一個更安全、更健康的工作環境。在此多謝大家的參與，祝各位身體健康、工作平安！"
創新科技及工業局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-10-14 17:53,2025-10-14 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400643.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（十月十四日）出席香港新型工業加速前行─「新型工業加速計劃」項目起動儀式後會見傳媒的談話內容：

創新科技及工業局局長：今天非常高興來見證亞洲先進同位素技術公司於香港科技園轄下的大埔創新園正式建立Alpha核素生產線，以及小型超導迴旋加速器生產線，他們計劃於二○二七年開始首次在香港生產這種目前全球緊缺的AC225核素，這也是首次在亞洲生產這種正在進行臨床試驗的靶向性核素藥物的重要原料。

該公司計劃在香港投資約6億港元，主要是用來購買儀器設備、建立智能生產線，以及廠房裝修、改造等。這個項目充分體現了由海外引進先進技術在香港落地生產這樣一個成功路徑，通過引進國外先進製藥技術，在香港落地建立生產線，建立製造Made in Hong Kong的產品，進一步在整個亞洲以至全球擴展相關的業務。這種「引進來、走出去」的模式將會加速在香港建立創科產業，為香港經濟注入新動能。

我期待未來能見到更多這樣的成功案例，與我們特區政府、社會各界一起加速推進香港新型工業化，一起擦亮「香港研發、香港製造、邁向世界」這樣一個品牌。下面我樂意回答記者朋友提出的問題。

記者：「新型工業加速計劃」推出以來，差不多一年，共批出多少個生產線、項目？還有批出多少資助？

創新科技及工業局局長：這個計劃是從去年下半年推出，至今我們已經審視了十來個項目，我們正式批出了三個項目，還有幾個項目目前正在審視。隨着未來香港特別是北部都會區加快建設，香港創科生態越來越好，我相信會有更多申請，而且我們也會批出更多項目。

記者：這個是比較高科技和高監管門檻的項目，為何認為香港適合這些高端製造業落戶？

創新科技及工業局局長：首先，這是國際先進技術在香港落地，它生產的產品也是目前全球緊缺的產品，我剛才也講這將是目前在亞洲唯一生產（靶向性）核素藥物的關鍵原料，符合香港定位——即是高技術、高增值的發展路向。我們希望未來有更多這樣的高新技術、科技含量比較高的，而且充滿國際化的企業能夠在香港落戶，以滿足現在香港希望在全球發展創新科技的布局、創科產業的計劃。我可以高興的跟你講，現在還有幾個項目正在審核當中，會越來越多。

記者：可否再說出在100億元計劃中批出了多少資助？

創新科技及工業局局長：項目的總投資額共17億元，主要是有三個項目，陸續會有更多，因為我們總共拿出了100億元去支持，17億元的項目裏，政府資助的大概有三分之一，所以我們還有很大的空間。我們希望能夠在未來的幾年批出50個或以上的項目。"

李家超歡迎張軍院長率領代表團訪港，出席司法法律界的交流活動。李家超感謝最高人民法院一直以來支持律政司的工作，包括建立覆蓋面廣的民商事司法協助機制、成立粵港澳大灣區司法法律合作恆常對接平台和支持香港建設成為國際法律及爭議解決服務中心等。

李家超表示，現行的「港資港法」和「港資港仲裁」已納入成為《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》下的措施，體現中央政府對於香港法律制度的重視與支持。香港會繼續用好與國際接軌的普通法制度和爭議解決服務的獨特優勢，全面發揮「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台作用，服務大灣區建立更國際化的營商環境。

李家超指出，香港擁有世界級的法律及爭議解決服務專業人才，亦是亞太區最受歡迎的仲裁地。隨着國際調解院總部落戶香港，香港會繼續積極深化國際交往合作，支持國際調解院提供友好、靈活、經濟和高效的調解服務，同時鞏固香港國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的定位，進一步強化香港作為國際法律樞紐和調解之都的地位。

最高人民法院分管日常工作的副院長鄧修明、最高人民法院副院長茅仲華和律政司司長林定國資深大律師亦有出席會面。

CE meets President of Supreme People's Court (with photo),2025-10-14 17:45,2025-10-14 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400654.htm,"The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, met with the President of the Supreme People's Court, Mr Zhang Jun, at Government House today (October 14) to exchange views on issues of mutual concern.

Mr Lee welcomed Mr Zhang and his delegation to Hong Kong to attend an exchange event among the judicial and legal sectors. He expressed his gratitude to the Supreme People's Court (SPC) for its support of the Department of Justice, including establishing extensive mutual legal assistance in civil and commercial matters, setting up a standing interface platform on judicial and legal co-operation in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and supporting Hong Kong to develop itself as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services.

Mr Lee noted that the current measures of allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law and allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to choose Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration have been incorporated into the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, reflecting the Central Government's emphasis and support for Hong Kong's legal system. Hong Kong will continue to leverage its unique advantages in its internationalised common law system and dispute resolution services to fully play its role as a two-way platform for enterprises to go global and attract external investment, serving the GBA in building a more internationalised business environment.

Mr Lee highlighted that Hong Kong boasts world-class legal and dispute resolution professionals, and is also the most preferred seat of arbitration in the Asia-Pacific region. With the establishment of the International Organization for Mediation’s (IOMed) headquarters in Hong Kong, the city will continue to actively deepen international exchanges and co-operation, and support the IOMed's provision of friendly, flexible, economical and efficient mediation services to consolidate its status as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services, and reinforce its positions as an international legal hub and the capital of mediation.

The Executive Vice-president of the SPC, Mr Deng Xiuming; Vice-president of the SPC Mr Mao Zhonghua; and the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, also attended the meeting."

The register has been published on the DEVB website (www.devb.gov.hk/en/construction_sector_matters/adjudicator-nominating-bodies/under-ordinance-cap-652/index.html).

A DEVB spokesman said, ""The establishment of the register of adjudicator nominating bodies marks an important step in the implementation of the Ordinance, which allows contracting parties to appoint suitable adjudicators through nominating bodies to conduct adjudication for payment disputes. Applications for adjudicator nominating bodies have been opened since February 10 this year. The feedback from the industry was positive. With consideration of the establishment, recognition, financial resources and implementation capabilities of the applicants, we now announce that we have accepted the registration applications of five nominating bodies. These organisations are professional institutions or institutions specialising in handling contract disputes and are familiar with the operation of the construction industry.""

The five organisations registered as nominating bodies are Asian African Legal Consultative Organization - Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre, the Hong Kong Institute of Architects, the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors, the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers and the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre.

The Ordinance aims to improve the longstanding payment problems in the construction industry and provide better protection for the stakeholders in the supply chains of the construction industry to receive their entitled payments on time. The Ordinance improves contractual payment terms, prohibiting the use of unfair payment terms such as ""pay when paid"". It also introduces an adjudication mechanism to provide a speedy, cost-effective and binding resolution process for payment disputes in the interim. The Ordinance has come to full operation on August 28, 2025. Under the Ordinance, the claimant can initiate adjudication proceedings for a payment dispute, and the nominating body will appoint an adjudicator, as an independent third party, to determine a payment dispute.

Under the Ordinance, functions of a nominating body include establishing and maintaining a panel of adjudicators, formulating nomination procedures, appointing suitable adjudicators for payment disputes, setting appropriate adjudication rules for conducting adjudication proceedings, etc. To facilitate smooth implementation of the Ordinance, the DEVB will oversee the performance of the adjudicator nominating bodies to ensure that the operations of theadjudicator nominating bodies comply with the requirements of the Ordinance and relevant guidelines.

Appointment of Chairman of MTR Corporation Limited announced,2025-10-14 16:30,2025-10-14 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400333.htm,"The Government announced today (October 14) that, in accordance with the Articles of Association of the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) and as the majority shareholder, the Financial Secretary Incorporated has appointed Dr Jacob Kam Chak-pui to succeed Dr Rex Auyeung Pak-kuen as the next Chairman of the board of directors of the Corporation with effect from January 1, 2026. The appointment is for three years until December 31, 2028. Dr Kam had been appointed, with effect from January 1, 2026, as a non-executive director of the Corporation by the MTRCL earlier today.

The Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, thanked Dr Auyeung for his significant contributions since taking up the chairmanship of the MTRCL in July 2019. Under the leadership of Dr Auyeung, the MTRCL completed the full commissioning of the Tuen Ma Line as well as the East Rail Line Cross-harbour Extension projects, further enhancing the connectivity of the railway network. The MTRCL also proactively advanced a series of strategic railway projects, including the Tung Chung Line Extension, the Oyster Bay Station, the Kwu Tung Station, the Tuen Mun South Extension, the Hung Shui Kiu Station, and the Northern Link which commenced works recently, contributing to Hong Kong's overall social and economic development.

Ms Chan said that the MTRCL, carrying over 5 million passengers daily, is the backbone of Hong Kong's public transport system. She expected the new Chairman to draw on his extensive years of experience in railway operations to lead the MTRCL in applying innovative technologies to continuously enhance the safety, efficiency and reliability of Hong Kong's railways, and uphold the MTRCL's mission of ""Keep Cities Moving"", such that railway infrastructure can be leveraged to add momentum to Hong Kong's development and cross-boundary integration with the Mainland."

運輸及物流局局長陳美寶感謝歐陽伯權博士自二○一九年七月出任港鐵公司主席以來的重要貢獻。其間，在歐陽伯權博士領導下，港鐵公司完成了屯馬線全線及東鐵線過海段項目，使鐵路網絡更加四通八達；並積極開展一系列策略性鐵路項目，包括東涌線延線、小蠔灣站、古洞站、屯門南延線、洪水橋站，以及日前剛動土的北環線，推動香港整體社會和經濟發展。

陳美寶表示，港鐵每日接載超過五百萬人次出行，是香港交通運輸的骨幹。她期望新任主席憑藉其多年鐵路營運的經驗，帶領港鐵公司應用創新科技，持續提升香港鐵路的安全、效率及可靠性，並延續港鐵「推動城市前行」的使命，以鐵路基建為香港的發展及與內地的跨界融合添加動能。"

祝春曉總裁（亞洲先進同位素技術有限公司聯合創始人兼行政總裁）、李鷹博士（亞洲先進同位素技術有限公司聯合創始人）、Sunny（香港科技園公司董事局主席查毅超博士）、Terry（香港科技園公司行政總裁黃秉修）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今天我非常高興出席由香港科技園公司與亞洲先進同位素技術公司（同位素公司）共同舉辦的香港新型工業加速前行─「新型工業加速計劃」（加速計劃）項目起動儀式，與大家一同見證這一重要時刻。

政府一直致力以科技創新引領產業創新，積極推動香港邁向新型工業化。其中，我們特別重視從海內外引入前沿技術，並以此為基礎發展本地產業，帶動產業鏈的建設與升級，促進經濟高質量發展。今天啟動的項目，正是這一戰略方向的具體實踐。

同位素公司是一家來自海外的高技術公司，它們將在大埔創新園設立全新生產設施，總投資六億港元，是在「加速計劃」下另一個獲得「新型工業評審委員會」支持的項目。這個項目亦展示了如何通過由海外引入前沿技術和人才，在香港落地生根，繼而走向亞洲、邁向全球的典型範例。這個項目的技術源自於國際先進研發成果，專注於醫療用超導迴旋加速器及放射性藥物的智能生產。我們現在身處的廠房計劃於二○二七年生產現時全球緊缺的AC225核素，將會是亞洲首次生產這種正進行臨床試驗的靶向性核素藥物的重要原料，助力香港發展生命健康科技產業，建設國際創科中心。

我們欣喜地看到，越來越多與同位素公司同樣優秀的創科企業，選擇將海外的前沿技術帶到香港，在這裏建立研發、中試與生產基地，並借助香港的國際化平台，將產品與服務推向全球市場。這種「引進來、走出去」的成功模式，建基於香港獨特的優勢，既豐富了香港的產業生態，也為我們的經濟發展注入新動能。

特區政府於去年推出「新型工業加速計劃」，目的是進一步扶植創科企業在香港發展，同時我們亦因應市場反饋而持續優化計劃。上月公布的《施政報告》下調「加速計劃」申請門檻，將項目總成本最低要求由3億元調低至1.5億元，並為聘用相關技術人員提供配對資助，以切實地回應企業的需求，鼓勵更多智能生產設施的建設。香港正處於創科產業發展的關鍵歷史時期，既有機遇，亦有挑戰。我們歡迎並將繼續積極扶植海內外的創科企業來港發展，攜手邁向更大的成功。

最後，我要感謝科技園與同位素公司為推動香港新型工業化所作的努力。我相信，將會有更多企業選擇香港作為它們技術落地與業務拓展的基地，擦亮「香港研發、香港製造、走向世界」這一品牌。祝同位素公司業務蒸蒸日上，在座各位身體健康！謝謝大家！"
