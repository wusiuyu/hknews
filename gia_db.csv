(2)Oral treatment due to injuries inflicted in the incident, including medication for dental pain relief, simple fillings, emergency pulp treatment and extractions.

  Affected residents in need can call the hotlines or visit any DHC in person to seek assistance, regardless of their current place of residence. Those who are registered as DHC members may also contact their respective DHC directly. The hotlines have been posted on the websites of the PHC Commission and the DHCs. Case managers of the DHCs will assist in pairing them with the participating dentists based on their individual situations and preferences.

銀行可以透過沙盒，獲得跨領域專業人士的支持，以及金管局、商經局和知識產權署的指導，制定並完善其知識產權融資的安排。措施亦能為銀行日後提供知識產權融資累積實務經驗，以更好滿足創新企業的需要，尤其是擁有豐富知識產權但欠缺有形資產作銀行融資抵押品的中小企。

香港三家主要銀行已經加入沙盒成為首批參與者，並確認有來自生物科技、電子及科技行業的客戶對透過沙盒測試知識產權融資交易感興趣（見附件）。"
"HKMA, CEDB and IPD launch IP Financing Sandbox",2025-12-22 17:05,2025-12-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200243.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB) and the Intellectual Property Department (IPD), launched the Intellectual Property (IP) Financing Sandbox today (December 22).

As set out in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"", the IP Financing Sandbox aims to assist pilot sectors in leveraging IP assets for financing.

The Sandbox serves to provide a collaborative and risk-controlled environment for banks, IP valuation firms, legal practitioners and other relevant professions to test the full lifecycle of IP financing arrangements that are based on IP assets such as patents, trademarks and copyrights.

Through the Sandbox, banks can develop and refine their IP financing arrangements with the support from multidisciplinary professionals as well as guidance by the HKMA, the CEDB and the IPD. This initiative can also enable banks to accumulate practical experience in providing IP financing to better serve the needs of innovative enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises which are rich in IP assets but may lack tangible assets that can be pledged as collateral for bank financing.

Three major banks in Hong Kong have joined the Sandbox as inaugural participants, and have solicited interests from clients from the biotechnology, electronics and technology sectors to conduct pilot trials of IP financing through the Sandbox (see Annex)."
Financing sandbox launched today with opening of Hong Kong Technology and Innovation Support Centre to foster intellectual property financing and innovation,2025-12-22 17:00,2025-12-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200461.htm,"  The Government announced today (December 22) the official launch of the intellectual property (IP) financing sandbox and the opening of the Hong Kong Technology and Innovation Support Centre (HKTISC), marking key milestones in promoting IP financing and further developing Hong Kong's IP trading ecosystem while fostering innovation.

  The Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address the launch of the sandbox to assist pilot sectors (particularly the technology sector) in leveraging IPs for financing with the support of the banking, insurance, valuation, legal and other professions. The sandbox will provide a collaborative and risk-controlled environment for stakeholders to test out the full lifecycle of IP financing and accumulate practical experience in providing IP financing.

  With the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB), the Intellectual Property Department (IPD) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) deliberation, the sandbox is underpinned by the following four core operating principles:

(1) Recognition of IP value: Participating banks will consider the value of IPs owned by borrowing enterprises, alongside the borrower's credit demand, financial position and repayment ability in their credit underwriting process.

(2) Independent and standardised valuation: To ensure credibility, IP valuation will be conducted by independent service providers using universally accepted methods. Where appropriate, qualitative patent evaluation reports can be obtained to support this process.

(3) Risk management: Participating banks should comply with applicable supervisory requirements on risk management, while participating enterprises should comply with the legal and regulatory requirements in respect of maintaining and developing the IP assets concerned.

(4) Stakeholder collaboration: The initiative relies on a cohesive ecosystem. It brings together enterprises that hold IP assets, banks, valuation experts, legal practitioners and other relevant professionals to co-create successful financing transactions.

  The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, said that the IP financing sandbox, together with other related measures announced in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"", would help leverage Hong Kong's unique strengths to build an ecosystem where IP is protected with rigour, valued with clarity, and financed with confidence, with a view to strengthening Hong Kong's role as a regional IP trading centre.

  By enabling enterprises to leverage their IP assets for financing, the sandbox will help unlock a new financing channel, thereby supporting the commercialisation of outcomes of research and development as well as creativity, and promoting innovation and technology as a key driver of economic growth.

Three major banks have committed to participating in the sandbox, while nearly 30 professional firms from the legal and valuation sectors have indicated keen interest in participating. The CEDB, the IPD and the HKMA will closely monitor the progress of the pilot projects, gather feedback, and provide guidance as needed. It is anticipated that several trial cases are in the pipeline for the first phase of the sandbox.

In addition, the HKTISC that officially commenced full operations today is another key complementary initiative in promoting IP financing. With the support of the IPD, the HKTISC will closely engage small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the innovation and technology sector and provide a qualitative patent evaluation service to assess, based on national standards, the quality of their patents from legal, technological and economic perspectives. The Government will also launch a support scheme through the HKTISC in 2026 to financially assist SMEs to engage professional service providers for the valuation of their whole IP portfolios in monetary terms.

These integrated measures aim to provide an objective reference about the strengths of the patents and the monetary valuation of the whole IP portfolios owned by the SMEs, facilitating more effective credit assessment and investment analysis.

The Technology and Innovation Support Centre is a dedicated programme of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which supports researchers and innovators at different stages of the innovation cycle, helping them make use of the IP system (especially by means of patents) to protect their inventions and guiding them to bring the technology to market. With the recognition of the Hong Kong Productivity Council as a Technology and Innovation Support Centre hosting institution by the China National Intellectual Property Administration and WIPO, the HKTISC will join the 200-plus strong Technology and Innovation Support Centre network in the country, which promotes better integration of Hong Kong into overall national development."

新措施內容如下：

（一）使用電腦程式或自動化工具干擾「SmartPLAY康體通」的罰則

為保障公平使用「SmartPLAY康體通」系統，康文署將打擊使用電腦程式或其他自動化工具進行預訂交易或干擾系統正常運作的不當行為。「SmartPLAY康體通」加入了禁止使用電腦程式或其他自動化工具預訂場地的條件（www.smartplay.lcsd.gov.hk/website/tc/about/conditions-of-use-of-smartplay.html），由二○二六年一月二十一日起，如用戶違反有關條件，康文署會暫停其帳戶360日，無須給予任何預先通知。康文署再次提醒用戶必須遵守「SmartPLAY康體通」的使用條件，妥善管理SmartPLAY帳戶資料，切勿向他人透露用戶帳號及密碼；曾將SmartPLAY帳號及密碼提供予第三者的用戶，請盡快及定期更新用戶密碼，以免帳戶被盜用。

（二）預訂室內籃球場和排球場的新規定

現時在「SmartPLAY康體通」預訂草地足球場時，租用人必須填寫另外四名用場人士的資料，並須與其中三人一同簽取場地及於租訂段節在場使用設施，此舉旨在確保租用人是真正用家，實施以來取得一定成效。此措施將應用於廣受歡迎的室內籃球場及排球場，由二○二六年一月二十一日起，租用人在預訂室內籃球場及排球場時，必須填寫另外兩名用場人士的資料，並須與其中一人一同簽取場地及在場使用設施，詳情載於康文署「改善康體設施訂場及使用安排」專題網頁（www.lcsd.gov.hk/tc/facilities/facilitiesbooking/procedure/ls_fac_improve.html）。

（三）「執雞」安排不再適用於室內籃球場和排球場

按現行適用於部分康體設施的措施，租用人如於所租訂的段節開始十分鐘後仍未簽取場地，而當時沒有同類設施可供租訂，康文署會酌情容許其他使用者免費使用未被取場的設施，作與原租用人租場的相同用途（即俗稱「執雞」安排）。康文署注意到有室內籃球場和排球場的租用人故意於用場當天不取場，並安排其他人「執雞」，進行懷疑「炒場」活動。針對上述濫用措施的行為，參考現時草地足球場的相關安排，由二○二五年十二月三十日起，「執雞」安排不再適用於室內籃球場及排球場。

康文署會密切監察新措施的成效，於有需要時會繼續優化「SmartPLAY康體通」，以及推出更多打擊「炒場」的措施。"
LCSD introduces new measures to strengthen efforts to combat touting activities,2025-12-22 17:00,2025-12-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200238.htm,"  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) announced today (December 22) that new measures will be implemented to strengthen efforts to combat unauthorised transfer of bookings of LCSD recreation and sports facilities/venues (commonly referred to as touting activities).

  The new measures are as follows:

(1) Penalties for using computer programmes or automated tools to interfere with SmartPLAY

  To ensure the fair use of the SmartPLAY system, the LCSD will combat improper conduct involving the use of computer programmes or other automated tools to make booking transactions or interfere with the normal operation of the system. Specifically, SmartPLAY has incorporated conditions prohibiting the use of computer programmes or other automated tools to make bookings (www.smartplay.lcsd.gov.hk/website/en/about/conditions-of-use-of-smartplay.html). Starting from January 21, 2026, if users breach the conditions concerned, the LCSD will immediately suspend their accounts for 360 days without giving any prior notice. The LCSD once again reminds users of the need to comply with the ""Conditions of Use of SmartPLAY"", to properly manage the information of their SmartPLAY accounts, and not to disclose their user account numbers and passwords to others. Users having so provided their user account numbers and passwords to a third party are advised to change their passwords as soon as possible and regularly update them to prevent unauthorised use of their accounts.

(2) New measures for booking indoor basketball and volleyball courts

  Currently, a hirer who books turf soccer pitch through SmartPLAY is required to provide the SmartPLAY user account information of four other users. The hirer and three of the users named in the booking are required to check-in together and be present during the use of the booked session. This arrangement, aiming to ensure that hirers are genuine users, is generally effective since implementation. It will apply to indoor basketball and volleyball courts, which are popular facilities, starting from January 21, 2026. A hirer is required to provide the information of two other users when booking an indoor basketball or volleyball court. The hirer and one of the users named in the booking are required to check-in together and be present during use of the booked session. Details are available at the LCSD's thematic webpage ""Improvement measures to booking and use of recreation and sports facilities"" (www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/facilities/facilitiesbooking/procedure/ls_fac_improve.html).

(3) Standby arrangement no longer applicable to indoor basketball and volleyball courts

  Under the existing measures applicable to some recreation and sports facilities, if a hirer does not take up the booked facility 10 minutes after the booked session starts, the LCSD may at its discretion permit other users to use the facility free of charge for the same purpose as the original hirer (commonly referred to as the standby arrangement), on condition that there are no other same-type facilities available for booking at the material time. In this connection, the LCSD has observed that certain hirers of indoor basketball and volleyball courts deliberately do not take up the booked sessions on the day of use, and are suspected to have engaged in touting activities by arranging for other users to use the booked courts under the standby arrangement. To combat such abuse of the standby arrangement, and making reference to the current arrangement for turf football pitches, the standby arrangement will no longer be applicable to indoor basketball and volleyball courts with effect from December 30, 2025.

  LCSD will closely monitor the effectiveness of the new measures, and continue to enhance SmartPLAY as well as implement further anti-touting measures as necessary."

知識產權融資沙盒今日推出　香港技術與創新中心同步營運　促進知識產權融資及創新發展,2025-12-22 17:00,2025-12-22 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200465.htm,"政府今日（十二月二十二日）宣布，知識產權融資沙盒正式推出，香港技術與創新支持中心亦同步營運，標誌着香港在推動知識產權融資、進一步發展知識產權交易生態圈和培育創新方面的重要里程碑。

行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》宣布推出知識產權融資沙盒，透過銀行、保險、估值、法律和其他專業，協助試點行業（特別是科技行業）利用知識產權進行融資。沙盒將提供一個協作和風險可控的環境，讓持份者測試整個融資安排和累積實務經驗。

融資沙盒由商務及經濟發展局（商經局）、知識產權署和香港金融管理局（金管局）共同籌劃，其運作建基於以下四項核心目標：

（一）確認知識產權價值：
參與銀行在信貸審批過程中，會考慮借款企業所擁有的知識產權資產價值，以及借款人的信貸需求、財務狀況及還款能力。

（二）獨立及標準化估值：
知識產權的估值會由獨立服務提供者按國際認可的方法進行，確保估值具公信力。在適用情況下，可索取專利質素分析報告，以支援相關估值程序。

（三）風險管理：
參與銀行須符合風險管理的監管要求；參與企業則須符合維護及發展相關知識產權資產的法例及法規要求。

（四）持份者協作：
計劃的成功有賴一個緊密協作的生態圈，沙盒匯聚擁有知識產權資產的企業、銀行、估值專家、法律執業者及其他相關專業人士，共同促成融資交易。

商經局局長丘應樺表示，知識產權融資沙盒連同其他《行政長官2025年施政報告》公布的相關措施，將有助發揮香港的獨特優勢，構建一個讓知識產權受嚴格保護、獲清晰估值及具融資信心的生態系統，從而鞏固香港作為區域知識產權貿易中心的地位。

透過讓企業運用其知識產權資產進行融資，沙盒可為企業打開新的融資渠道，支持科研及創意成果的商品化，並進一步推動創新科技成為經濟增長的重要動力。

三間主要銀行已承諾參與計劃，而來自法律及估值界別接近30間專業機構亦已表達濃厚參與意欲。商經局、知識產權署和金管局會密切監察試點項目的進展及收集意見，並按需要提供指導。沙盒計劃第一階段預計將有數宗試點個案。

此外，今日正式全面投入運作的香港技術與創新支持中心，是推動知識產權融資另一項重要配套措施。在知識產權署的協助下，中心將與創新科技界別的中小企業緊密合作，提供專利質素分析服務，按照國家標準，從法律、技術及經濟多個層面評估其專利的質素。政府亦會透過中心於二○二六年推出支援計劃，資助中小企業聘用專業服務提供者，為其整體知識產權組合進行金額估值。

上述綜合措施旨在就中小企業所持有專利的優勢，以及其整體知識產權組合的金額估值，提供客觀參考，從而促進更具效益的信貸評估及投資分析。
​
技術與創新支持中心是世界知識產權組織的專項計劃，旨在於創新周期不同階段支援科研人員及創新者，協助他們善用知識產權制度（特別是專利）保障發明，並引導其將技術商品化。隨着香港生產力促進局獲國家知識產權局和世界知識產權組織認可為技術與創新支持中心承辦機構，香港技術與創新支持中心正式成為國家200餘所技術與創新支持中心網絡的成員之一，推動香港更好地融入國家發展大局。"
​財庫局局長主持黃金市場發展簡介會介紹未來發展策略和方向（附圖）,2025-12-22 16:38,2025-12-22 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200453.htm,"行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》中宣布接納「推動黃金市場發展工作小組」的建議，並交由財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）落實。財庫局局長許正宇在今日（十二月二十二日）舉行的黃金市場發展簡介會上向業界表示，香港黃金市場的全產業鏈已初步形成，政府正積極以打造香港成為國際黃金交易、儲存、清算及風險管理中心為目標。

黃金市場發展簡介會由財庫局舉辦，旨在向業界介紹政府建立國際黃金交易市場的長遠策略和整體方向，當中涵蓋拓展倉儲、提升黃金供給、建設基礎設施、豐富投資工具及發展本地黃金交易生態圈等多個範疇。交易所、銀行、資產管理、金礦勘探、貿易及精煉、倉儲和運輸界別均有派員出席。

許正宇說：「自行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》中前瞻性地提出要構建國際黃金交易中心，經過一年多的時間，結合政府、監管機構和業界的力量，我樂見香港黃金市場的全產業鏈已初步形成。過程中，業界反應正面，提供了許多寶貴意見。憑藉香港作為國際金融中心的地位，以及背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，我們會繼續與業界緊密合作，合力將香港打造為國際黃金交易、儲存、清算及風險管理的中心。」

他指出，政府至今推出的各項措施已取得實質進展。在倉儲設施方面，香港機場管理局已完成機場貴金屬儲存庫首階段擴建，容量達200公噸，並正積極落實進一步擴容至1 000公噸的計劃。同時，上海黃金交易所已在香港建立首個離岸倉庫。此外，財庫局已與深圳市地方金融管理局簽署合作備忘錄，共同構建深度融合的區域黃金生態圈，為港深兩地開展加工貿易合作奠定基礎。在黃金交易清算方面，由政府全資擁有的公司所管理的香港黃金中央清算系統計劃於二○二六年內開展試營運。

為支持業界成立黃金行業組織，政府將成立籌備小組，廣泛吸納本地及國際業界持份者參與，推動業界協作，促成一個由業界自主營運的行業組織。籌備小組將就行業組織的組成方式、成員資格及財務安排等細節深入討論。

許正宇補充說：「我們期望透過即將成立的籌備小組進一步加強與業界的合作。日後，行業組織將有助深化與政府及監管機構的溝通，並在業務發展、海內外推廣、國際合作及人才培育等方面發揮關鍵作用，助力香港黃金市場實現長遠發展。」"
SFST chairs briefing session on gold market development to outline future strategies and directions (with photos),2025-12-22 16:38,2025-12-22 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200457.htm,"The Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address that he has accepted the recommendations of the Working Group on Promoting Gold Market Development, and tasked the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) with taking forward the implementation work. At a briefing session on gold market development today (December 22), the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, told industry stakeholders that a complete industry chain has initially taken shape for Hong Kong's gold market, and the Government is actively working towards the goal of establishing Hong Kong as an international centre for gold trading, storage, clearing and risk management.

Organised by the FSTB, the briefing session aimed to introduce to the industry the Government's long-term strategy and overall direction for building an international gold trading market. This encompasses multiple areas, including expanding storage capacity, enhancing gold supply, establishing infrastructure, diversifying investment vehicles and developing a local gold trading ecosystem. Attendees included representatives from exchanges, banks, asset management companies, gold mining, trading firms and refineries, warehouse operators as well as logistics providers.

Mr Hui said, ""Stemming from the visionary idea of developing an international gold trading centre put forward by the Chief Executive in his 2024 Policy Address, I am pleased to see that Hong Kong's gold market has begun to take shape, with a complete industry chain preliminarily established over the past year or so under the concerted efforts of the Government, regulators and the industry. The industry's response has been positive, and many constructive suggestions have been received. Leveraging Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and its unique advantages of enjoying strong support from the motherland and being closely connected to the world, we will continue working closely with the industry, with a view to developing Hong Kong into an international hub for gold trading, storage, clearing and risk management.""

He highlighted the meaningful strides already realised through Government's initiatives. In terms of storage facilities, the Airport Authority Hong Kong has completed the first-phase expansion of the precious metals depository at the Hong Kong International Airport, increasing capacity to 200 tonnes, and is pressing ahead with plans to further expand it to 1 000 tonnes. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Gold Exchange has launched its first offshore vault in Hong Kong. In addition, the FSTB and the Shenzhen Municipal Financial Regulatory Bureau have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly build a deeply integrated regional gold ecosystem, laying a foundation for further co-operation in processing trade between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. On gold trading and clearing, the central clearing system for gold in Hong Kong, governed by a wholly government-owned company, is scheduled to commence trial operation in 2026.

To support the setting up of a trade organisation for the gold industry, the Government will set up a preparatory taskforce to engage a wide range of local and international stakeholders, with a view to promoting industry collaboration and facilitating the formation of a self-governing industry body. The preparatory taskforce will also hold in-depth discussions on details such as the structure, membership and financial arrangements of the future industry organisation.

Mr Hui added, ""Through the upcoming preparatory taskforce, we look forward to further strengthening our collaboration with the industry. The future industry organisation will help enhance communication with the Government and regulators, and play an instrumental role in business development, global promotion, international co-operation and talent nurturing, thereby contributing to the long-term development of Hong Kong's gold market."""
二零二五年第三季香港國際收支平衡及國際投資頭寸統計,2025-12-22 16:30,2025-12-22 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200430.htm,"政府統計處今日（十二月二十二日）發布二零二五年第三季香港國際收支平衡及國際投資頭寸的初步統計數字，並一併發布同期的香港對外債務的初步統計數字。

I.國際收支平衡

香港於二零二五年第三季錄得1,365億元的國際收支赤字（相當於本地生產總值的16.0%），而儲備資產相應地減少同等數額。二零二五年第二季則錄得1,055億元的盈餘（相當於本地生產總值的13.4%）。

經常賬戶

二零二五年第三季的經常賬戶錄得982億元盈餘（相當於本地生產總值的11.5%），這反映香港儲蓄多於投資，令其累積對外金融資產（例如股本證券或債務證券），在環球金融波動時提供緩衝。與二零二四年第三季的1,132億元經常賬戶盈餘（相當於本地生產總值的13.9%）比較，盈餘減少主要是由於初次收入淨流入減少，而服務貿易盈餘增加則抵銷了部分經常賬戶盈餘的跌幅。

二零二五年第三季的貨物貿易錄得15億元盈餘，而二零二四年同季則錄得6億元赤字。同期，服務貿易盈餘由388億元增加至481億元。二零二五年第三季的初次收入流入和流出分別為5,761億元和5,215億元，從而產生545億元淨流入，而二零二四年同季則錄得803億元淨流入。

金融賬戶

二零二五年第三季非儲備金融資產錄得2,710億元的整體增幅（相當於本地生產總值的31.7%），而二零二五年第二季則錄得211億元的整體增幅（相當於本地生產總值的2.7%）。二零二五年第三季的整體增幅源自其他投資、證券投資和金融衍生工具淨增加，而直接投資淨減少則抵銷了部分的整體增幅。

二零二五年第三季儲備資產減少1,365億元，而二零二五年第二季則增加1,055億元。

II. 國際投資頭寸

在二零二五年第三季季末，香港的對外金融資產和負債總值均處於很高的水平，分別為595,868億元（相當於本地生產總值的18.2倍）和399,369億元（相當於本地生產總值的12.2倍），這是一個重要國際金融中心常見的特點。

在二零二五年第三季季末，香港的對外金融資產淨值（即資產扣除負債）達196,499億元（相當於本地生產總值的6.0倍），而二零二五年第二季季末則為183,647億元（相當於本地生產總值的5.7倍）。香港的對外金融資產淨值與本地生產總值的比率是世界最大之一，為香港經濟面對突如其來的外來衝擊發揮強大的緩衝作用。

III. 對外債務

在二零二五年第三季季末，香港的對外債務總額為157,461億元（相當於本地生產總值的4.8倍）。與二零二五年第二季季末的154,636億元（亦是相當於本地生產總值的4.8倍）比較，對外債務總額增加2,825億元，這主要歸因於其他界別對外債務的增加，而銀行界別對外債務的增加、直接投資債務負債（公司間借貸）以及香港金融管理局對外債務的增加也起到了推動作用。

作為世界其中一個主要金融中心，香港有大量源於本地銀行界別、透過日常的銀行業務而產生的對外債務。在二零二五年第三季季末，銀行界別的對外債務佔整體的52.3%。其他的對外債務主要包括其他界別的對外債務（29.9%）和直接投資的債務負債（公司間借貸）（16.5%）。

其他資料

國際收支平衡是一項統計報表，有系統地撮錄在一個指定期間內（一般是一年或一季）某經濟體與世界各地之間（即居民與非居民之間）進行的經濟交易。

國際投資頭寸是顯示一個經濟體在某特定時點的對外金融資產及負債存量的資產負債表。對外金融資產及負債總值的差額為該經濟體的國際投資頭寸淨值，等於對非居民的淨金融債權加上作為貨幣黃金持有的金塊。

對外債務總額指一個經濟體的居民在某特定時點欠非居民的實際現有（而並非或有）未償還負債款額。負債人並須於將來某些時點償還本金及／或利息。

表1展示香港國際收支平衡。表2展示詳細的經常賬戶及資本賬戶，而表3則展示詳細的金融賬戶。表4展示香港的國際投資頭寸，而表5則展示香港的對外債務。

二零二五年第三季的國際收支平衡、國際投資頭寸及對外債務統計數字均屬初步數字，日後將根據更新資料修訂。納入統計調查及其他來源的最新資料後，二零二四年的國際收支平衡、國際投資頭寸及對外債務統計數字現已修訂。

Hong Kong's Balance of Payments and International Investment Position statistics for third quarter of 2025,2025-12-22 16:30,2025-12-22 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200379.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (December 22) the preliminary Balance of Payments (BoP) and International Investment Position (IIP) statistics of Hong Kong for the third quarter of 2025. This release also included the preliminary External Debt (ED) statistics of Hong Kong for the same period.

I. Balance of Payments

  Hong Kong recorded a BoP deficit of $136.5 billion (16.0% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) in the third quarter of 2025. Reserve assets correspondingly decreased by the same amount. This was against a BoP surplus of $105.5 billion (13.4% of GDP) in the second quarter of 2025.

Current account

  The current account recorded a surplus of $98.2 billion (11.5% of GDP) in the third quarter of 2025. This reflects that Hong Kong's savings was greater than its investment, enabling Hong Kong to accumulate external financial assets (such as equity securities or debt securities) as a buffer against global financial volatilities. Compared with the current account surplus of $113.2 billion (13.9% of GDP) in the third quarter of 2024, the decrease in surplus was mainly due to the decrease in net inflow of primary income, partly offset by the increase in services surplus.

  The goods account recorded a surplus of $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2025, as against a deficit of $0.6 billion in the same quarter of 2024. Over the same period, the services surplus increased from $38.8 billion to $48.1 billion. The primary income inflow and outflow amounted to $576.1 billion and $521.5 billion respectively, thus yielding a net inflow of $54.5 billion in the third quarter of 2025, compared with a net inflow of $80.3 billion in the same quarter of 2024.

Financial account

  An overall increase in financial non-reserve assets amounting to $271.0 billion (31.7% of GDP) was recorded in the third quarter of 2025, compared with an overall increase of $21.1 billion (2.7% of GDP) in the second quarter of 2025. The overall increase recorded in the third quarter of 2025 was due to the net increases in other investment, portfolio investment and financial derivatives, partly offset by the net decrease in direct investment.

  In the third quarter of 2025, reserve assets decreased by $136.5 billion, as against an increase of $105.5 billion in the second quarter of 2025.

II. International Investment Position

  At the end of the third quarter of 2025, both Hong Kong's external financial assets and liabilities stood at a very high level, amounting to $59,586.8 billion (18.2 times of GDP) and $39,936.9 billion (12.2 times of GDP) respectively, a typical feature of a prominent international financial centre.

  Hong Kong's net external financial assets (i.e. assets minus liabilities) amounted to $19,649.9 billion (6.0 times of GDP) at the end of the third quarter of 2025, compared with $18,364.7 billion (5.7 times of GDP) at the end of the second quarter of 2025. Hong Kong's net external financial assets to GDP ratio is one of the largest in the world, which provides the economy with a strong cushion against sudden external shocks.

III. External Debt

  At the end of the third quarter of 2025, Hong Kong's gross ED amounted to $15,746.1 billion (4.8 times of GDP). Compared with $15,463.6 billion (also 4.8 times of GDP) at the end of the second quarter of 2025, gross ED increased by $282.5 billion. This was mainly attributable to the increase in ED of other sectors, while increases in ED of the banking sector, debt liabilities in direct investment (intercompany lending) and ED of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also contributed.

  As one of the world's major financial centres, Hong Kong has a significant amount of ED held against the local banking sector arising through normal banking businesses. At the end of the third quarter of 2025, 52.3% of Hong Kong's ED was attributable to the banking sector. Other ED mainly consisted of ED of other sectors (29.9%) and debt liabilities in direct investment (intercompany lending) (16.5%).

Further information

  BoP is a statistical statement that systematically summarises, for a specific time period (typically a year or a quarter), the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world (i.e. between residents and non-residents).

  IIP is a balance sheet showing the stock of external financial assets and liabilities of an economy at a particular time point.

  The difference between the total value of external financial assets and liabilities is the net IIP of the economy, which provides a measure of net financial claims on non residents plus gold bullion held as monetary gold.

  Gross ED, at a particular time point, is the outstanding amount of those actual current, and not contingent, liabilities that are owed to non-residents by residents of an economy and that require payment of principals and / or interests by the debtors at some time points in the future.

  Table 1 presents Hong Kong's BoP. Table 2 presents the detailed current account and capital account, while Table 3 presents the detailed financial account. Table 4 shows Hong Kong's IIP, and Table 5 shows Hong Kong's ED.

  Statistics on BoP, IIP and ED for the third quarter of 2025 are preliminary figures, which are subject to revision upon the availability of more data. With the incorporation of the latest data from surveys and other sources, the statistics on BoP, IIP and ED for 2024 have been revised.

  The latest statistical tables of BoP (including seasonally adjusted current account), IIP and ED can be downloaded at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/scode260.html). Analysis of the statistics, together with the conceptual and methodological details, are presented in the publication Balance of Payments, International Investment Position and External Debt Statistics of Hong Kong, Third Quarter 2025 published by the C&SD. Users can download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1040001&scode=260).

Consumer Price Indices for November 2025,2025-12-22 16:30,2025-12-22 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200435.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (December 22) the Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for November 2025. According to the Composite CPI, overall consumer prices rose by 1.2% in November 2025 over the same month a year earlier, the same as that in October 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rate of increase in the Composite CPI (i.e. the underlying inflation rate) in November 2025 was 1.0%, also the same as that in October 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, the average monthly rate of increase in the Composite CPI for the 3-month period ending November 2025 was 0.1%, the same as that for the 3-month period ending October 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the corresponding rates of increase were both 0.1%.

  Analysed by sub-index, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.5%, 1.1% and 1.1% respectively in November 2025, as compared to 1.4%, 1.1% and 1.0% respectively in October 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 0.9%, 1.0% and 1.1% respectively in November 2025, as compared to 0.9%, 1.0% and 1.0% respectively in October 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, for the 3-month period ending November 2025, the average monthly rates of change in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 0.0%, 0.1% and 0.1% respectively. The corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending October 2025 were 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the average monthly rates of change in the seasonally adjusted CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) for the 3-month period ending November 2025 were 0.0%, 0.1% and 0.1% respectively, and the corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending October 2025 were 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.2% respectively.

  Amongst the various components of the Composite CPI, year-on-year increases in prices were recorded in November 2025 for transport (3.5%), alcoholic drinks and tobacco (2.1%), miscellaneous services (1.9%), housing (1.6%), meals out and takeaway food (1.3%), miscellaneous goods (1.3%), and basic food (0.7%).

  On the other hand, year-on-year decreases in the components of the Composite CPI were recorded in November 2025 for clothing and footwear (-4.1%), durable goods (-3.3%), and electricity, gas and water (-0.5%).

  Taking the first 11 months of 2025 together, the Composite CPI rose by 1.4% over a year earlier. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.9%, 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.1%, 1.4%, 1.0% and 0.9% respectively.

  For the 3 months ending November 2025, the Composite CPI rose by 1.2% over a year earlier, while the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) rose by 1.4%, 1.0% and 1.0% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.0% and 1.0% respectively.

  For the 12 months ending November 2025, the Composite CPI was on average 1.4% higher than that in the preceding 12-month period. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.9%, 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.1%, 1.4%, 1.0% and 1.0% respectively.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that consumer price inflation stayed subdued in November, with the year-on-year increase in underlying Composite CPI unchanged at 1.0%. Price pressures on various major components were contained in general.

  Looking ahead, overall inflation should remain modest in the near term, as cost pressures on the domestic and external fronts are still broadly in check.

經季節性調整的綜合消費物價指數，截至二零二五年十一月止的三個月的平均每月升幅為0.1%，與截至二零二五年十月止的三個月的相應升幅相同。剔除所有政府一次性紓困措施的影響，相應的升幅均為0.1%。

從細分指數分析，甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數在二零二五年十一月份的按年升幅分別為1.5%、1.1%及1.1%，而二零二五年十月份的相應升幅分別為1.4%、1.1%及1.0%。剔除所有政府一次性紓困措施的影響，甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數在二零二五年十一月份的按年升幅分別為0.9%、1.0%及1.1%，在二零二五年十月份的升幅則分別為0.9%、1.0%及1.0%。

經季節性調整的甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數，截至二零二五年十一月止的三個月的平均每月變動率分別為0.0%、0.1%及0.1%，而截至二零二五年十月止的三個月的相應變動率分別為0.1%、0.1%及0.2%。剔除所有政府一次性紓困措施的影響，截至二零二五年十一月止的三個月，經季節性調整的甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數的平均每月變動率分別為0.0%、0.1%及0.1%，而截至二零二五年十月止的三個月的相應變動率則分別為0.1%、0.1%及0.2%。

在各類綜合消費物價指數組成項目中，價格在二零二五年十一月份錄得按年升幅的類別為交通（上升3.5%）、煙酒（上升2.1%）、雜項服務（上升1.9%）、住屋（上升1.6%）、外出用膳及外賣（上升1.3%）、雜項物品（上升1.3%），以及基本食品（上升0.7%）。

另一方面，綜合消費物價指數在二零二五年十一月份錄得按年跌幅的類別為衣履（下跌4.1%）、耐用物品（下跌3.3%），以及電力、燃氣及水（下跌0.5%）。

以二零二五年首十一個月合併計算，綜合消費物價指數較一年前同期上升1.4%，甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數的相應升幅分別為1.9%、1.3%及1.1%。剔除所有政府一次性紓困措施的影響，相應升幅則分別為1.1%、1.4%、1.0%及0.9%。

截至二零二五年十一月止的十二個月，綜合消費物價指數較一年前同期平均上升1.4%，甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數的相應升幅分別為1.9%、1.3%及1.1%。剔除所有政府一次性紓困措施的影響，相應升幅則分別為1.1%、1.4%、1.0%及1.0%。

評論

政府發言人表示，十一月消費物價通脹仍處於低水平，基本綜合消費物價指數按年上升維持在1.0%。各主要組成項目的價格壓力大致受控。

展望將來，由於來自本地及外圍的成本壓力仍大致受控，整體通脹短期內應保持輕微。

行政長官出席港深創新及科技園開園典禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-12-22 16:15,2025-12-22 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200533.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十二月二十二日）出席港深創新及科技園開園典禮的致辭：

尊敬的徐啟方副主任（國務院港澳事務辦公室分管日常工作的副主任）、尊敬的周霽主任（中央政府駐港聯絡辦公室主任）、尊敬的羅晃浩副市長（深圳市副市長）、各位嘉賓、各位市民：

歡迎各位今日齊聚在河套，共同見證香港創科發展的一個里程碑時刻——河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區，今日正式開園！

由香港園區連同深圳園區所組成的河套合作區，是國家「十四五」規劃下粵港澳大灣區的一個重要合作平台。河套的發展目標是要成為世界級創新平台，是國家實現地理上橫跨兩種社會制度、經濟和司法體制優勢，以科技創新為主題的重大合作區。

我衷心感謝中央政府一直以來的大力支持，亦感謝廣東省政府和深圳市政府，多年與特區政府和港深創新及科技園公司緊密合作，共同推動園區構建，實踐「一國兩制」下「一河兩岸」、「一區兩園」的創新理念。

去年，香港特區政府發布了《河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區發展綱要》，闡明香港園區的重點發展方向和策略，全力打造園區成為聯通內地與國際的世界級科技創新樞紐、國家培育發展新質生產力的重要策源地。

今年三月底，我在此出席了園區首三座大樓的平頂儀式，當時與各位提出了我們在此開啓創科新局面的四個理念，包括要以建設為基、以改革為綱、以融合為義、以合作為要，展示香港在創科領域不斷實現突破的決心。今日，港深創新及科技園已進入正式開園時刻，我想與大家介紹園區發展體現的三個關鍵進展。

第一，生動體現創科動力，積極構建高端人才集聚高地。自從園區三座大樓在三月平頂到今日這九個月以來，兩座濕實驗室大樓已有超過60間來自海外、內地及香港的企業和機構簽署租約，已租出約八成的樓面面積。園區設有生物樣本庫、數據中心等讓租戶使用的共用設施，同時，園區的人才公寓亦已迎來首批住客。

世界各地的創科企業和科研人員踴躍進駐園區，以行動投下對香港園區發展的信心一票。我們會積極向全球推廣大灣區建設和河套發展的龐大機遇，繼續吸引各地更多企業和人才一同在這片創科沃土大展鴻圖。

第二，全力實踐科研擴容，加快發展國際創新科技樞紐。香港園區第一批其餘的五座大樓，將會在二○二七年開始陸續完工。同時，香港園區的第二期規劃已經完成，會以凝聚高效市場和有為政府的公私營合作模式，加快建設發展。香港園區兩期發展提供的總樓面面積將達200萬平方米，規模比原本的規劃大增七成，為園區企業提供更多發展空間。

園區在未來將按功能劃分科技區塊，涵蓋生命健康科技、人工智能與數據科學、新科技與先進製造等支柱產業，推動產業有序發展，促進上、中、下游不同階段協同發展，打造完整創科產業鏈，服務大灣區構建國際科技創新中心的宏大目標。

第三，創新實現合作維度，高效促進跨境創科要素流動。隨着香港園區建設陸續落成，未來將有越來越多企業進駐園區這片創科沃土，園區將提供政策和基礎配套，便利科研人員往返兩地。

我在此向大家宣布，今日除了是香港園區正式開園，亦是連接港深兩個園區的西面跨河連接橋項目正式啓動的重要日子。

這項工程將打通河套合作區的交通網絡，有效促進跨境人員流動，發揮深港口岸設施和管理創新政策的優勢。深港雙方構建跨河連接橋，會突出科技低碳、安全便捷、宜人宜景的方向，實現連接橋與周邊生態環境融為一體的設計理念，並採用「一跨過河」的方案建造，體現連繫兩地園區「一區兩園」的新標誌，聯通大灣區的創新脈絡。

展望未來，我們將繼續推進河套香港園區的建設和發展，包括優化制度銜接、深化政策支援、積極引入優質企業與世界級科研團隊等。我有信心，河套合作區將成為香港創科發展的橋頭堡和試驗田，更將成為粵港澳大灣區，以至全球創新版圖上的創新政策示範地，是富有強大推動力的發展香港引擎。

就讓我們攜手並肩，堅持創新精神，共同開拓未來，一起服務國家高質量發展，共同譜寫創科新篇章。我祝願河套香港園區發展蒸蒸日上，在座各位鵬程萬里，一切順利。多謝大家！"

香港文化博物館展覽展示香港藝術家非遺新演繹（附圖）,2025-12-22 15:38,2025-12-22 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200321.htm,"香港文化博物館現正舉行「香港快拍．城市漫步—香港視覺藝術與非遺創新」展覽，四組香港年輕藝術家，包括嶺南畫派第四代藝術家羅令潔、香港長衫協會、ditto ditto版畫工作室及啟蜂製作，透過瓷畫、服裝設計、版畫及展覽裝置設計，展示香港獨特的城市景觀及文化面貌。展期至明年三月二日，免費入場。

展覽自二○二四年十月起，在第九屆「港澳視覺藝術雙年展」香港單元中展出，先後在杭州、南京、北京、廣州、深圳五個城市巡迴展覽，向內地觀眾展示香港獨特的城市文化景觀，反應熱烈。展覽現回到香港展出，更加入了香港非物資文化遺產（非遺）的解說，深入發掘藝術家對香港非遺及傳統工藝的守護、傳承與創新詮釋。

藝術家羅令潔傳承嶺南派畫風，結合西方繪畫技法繪製五組彩繪瓷碟。她以香港特色花鳥、自然景觀及歷史建築為題，於景德鎮白瓷碟上作畫。經過反覆的色彩及技法實驗，開闢了新穎的表現方法，更細緻地呈現瓷畫的彩色與光線變化。

香港長衫協會是國家級非物質文化遺產代表性項目的保護單位。其年輕設計團隊，以香港特色建築和城市記憶為題，將傳統非遺長衫工藝及經典剪裁，結合嶄新的提花與立體打印等先進技術，創作出四組兼具時代感的男女裝長衫，讓非遺工藝推廣至年輕一代。

ditto ditto版畫工作室一直致力將活版印刷技術的手工質感融入紙品設計，以香港的旅遊景點、風景名勝和美食為題，製作四套版畫及明信片。

啟蜂製作設計團隊則以靈活多變的香港街頭盒仔檔作概念，設計出四組融入舊香港視覺元素的摺疊組合式展覽裝置，並用作陳列上述三組藝術作品。

Heritage Museum exhibition showcases new creation by Hong Kong artists inspired by ICH (with photos),2025-12-22 15:38,2025-12-22 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200322.htm,"  The Hong Kong Heritage Museum is staging the ""HK Snapshotsâ§City Walks: Fresh Takes on Hong Kong's Art and Cultural Heritage"" exhibition, featuring four groups of young local artists, namely the fourth-generation Lingnan School artist Rebecca Lo, the Hong Kong Cheongsam Association, printing studio ditto ditto, and Key-Point Productions. Through porcelain painting, fashion design, letterpress printing and exhibition installation design, the exhibition presents unique facets of Hong Kong's cityscape and cultural personality. The exhibition will run until March 2 next year, with free admission.

  The exhibition has been on display at the Hong Kong section of the ninth edition of the Hong Kong-Macao Visual Art Biennale since October 2024. It has since travelled to five cities - Hangzhou, Nanjing, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen - and has received an overwhelming response. The exhibition introduced Hong Kong's unique cultural landscape to Mainland audiences. Now, it has returned to Hong Kong with supplementary information about the city's intangible cultural heritage (ICH), delving into the commitment of the artists to preserving, transmitting and innovatively interpreting Hong Kong's ICH and traditional craft skills.

  Lo inherits the painting style of the Lingnan School and incorporates the techniques of Western painting to create five porcelain plate sets. She painted local flowers and birds, natural landscapes, and historic buildings on Jingdezhen's white porcelain. With tireless experimentation with paints and techniques, she crafts new expressive forms, revealing colours and intricate variations on the porcelain with vivid detail.

  The Hong Kong Cheongsam Association, the protection organisation of the national ICH item, has formed a young designer team to create four innovative sets of men's and women's cheongsams. Featuring the city's unique architecture and memories, the team combines traditional ICH craftsmanship and classic tailoring with advanced technologies such as innovative jacquard weaving and 3D printing, promoting this ICH craftsmanship to younger generations.

  Adding personal touches to paper product design with the letterpress printing technique, the printing studio ditto ditto created four sets of printed works, postcards and calendars depicting Hong Kong attractions, scenic spots and cuisine.

  Designers from Key-Point Productions have drawn inspiration from flexible street stalls and have incorporated numerous visual elements from old Hong Kong into four foldable exhibition installations for displaying the three groups of artworks mentioned above.

Waste-to-energy facility IÂ·PARK1 trial operation proceeds smoothly (with photos/video),2025-12-22 15:28,2025-12-22 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200384.htm,"âThe Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (December 22) announced that the Integrated Waste Management Facilities Phase I (I·PARK1) has commenced the first phase of trial operation.

The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan; the Permanent Secretary for Environment and Ecology (Environment), Mr Eddie Cheung; the Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong; and the Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui, recently visited I·PARK1 to inspect its operations, observing various facility sections, including the unloading and tipping of waste compactor containers, waste treatment processes, waste-to-energy equipment, and flue gas treatment and emission control. They were also briefed by the project team on the progress of the trial operation.

Located on an artificial island off Shek Kwu Chau, I·PARK1 adopts advanced waste incineration technology capable of effectively decomposing organic compounds, including dioxins. I·PARK1 consists of three incineration modules, with a designed municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment capacity of 3 000 tonnes per day. At present, the first module, capable of processing 1 000 tonnes of MSW daily, has already commenced trial operation. The remaining two modules will begin phased trial operations at a later stage. The heat recovered from the incineration process is used to generate electricity, not only powering the facility's daily operation but also exporting 480 million kilowatt-hours of electricity to the public power grid, which is enough to power 100 000 households each year.

Following the inspection, Mr Tse said, ""The completion and phased commissioning of I·PARK1 marks the launch of a new approach for managing MSW in Hong Kong beyond reliance on landfills. It signifies a crucial step of Hong Kong toward achieving our target of 'zero waste landfilling' by 2035. In the meantime, we are advancing at full steam the construction of the Integrated Waste Management Facility Phase 2 (I·PARK2) in Tsang Tsui, Tuen Mun, while we remain committed to driving forward various initiatives on waste reduction, recycling, and resource circulation, continuing our progress toward the goal of 'zero waste landfilling' and carbon neutrality.""

Dr Chui said that the EPD has been closely monitoring the trial operation of I·PARK1 to ensure its operation and emissions comply with the stringent safety and environmental standards. Following I·PARK1's progressive commencement of operation, the total amount of MSW transported to West New Territories Landfill and North East New Territories Landfill will be reduced accordingly, alleviating the pressure on the two landfills.

In 2024, a total of 10 510 tonnes of MSW daily was disposed of in Hong Kong. I.PARK1 and the proposed I.PARK2 can treat 9 000 tonnes of MSW in total per day. If Hong Kong society can keep the momentum of waste reduction and increase the recycling rate, there may not be a need to construct I·PARK3 to achieve ""zero waste landfilling""."

環境及生態局局長謝展寰、環境及生態局常任秘書長（環境）張國財、環境及生態局副局長黃淑嫻及環保署署長徐浩光博士日前到訪I·PARK1視察其運作情況，實地了解設施的運作，包括壓縮貨櫃上岸及傾卸、廢物處理程序、轉廢為能設備和煙氣及排放處理等，並聽取了工程團隊匯報試運情況。

I·PARK1位於石鼓洲旁人工島上，採用先進的焚化技術，能有效分解包括二噁英在內的有機化合物。該設施共設有三個焚化模組，處理量為每日3 000公噸都市固體廢物。目前，第一個焚化模組已進入試行運作階段，每日可處理1 000公噸都市固體廢物，其餘兩個模組亦將於稍後分階段開始試行運作。焚燒處理過程中產生的熱能將用作發電，除供設施日常運作外，每年可輸出約4億8 000萬度電力至公眾電網，足夠供10萬戶家庭使用一年。

謝展寰在視察後表示：「I·PARK1的落成及陸續投入服務，為香港廢物管理開啓新篇章，把都市固體廢物轉化成能源，減少對堆填區的依賴，標誌着香港踏出了達致在二○三五年都市固體廢物『零廢堆填』的重要一步。我們現正全力推進於屯門曾咀興建第二座轉廢為能設施I·PARK2，配合持續推行的減廢回收和資源循環的工作，香港正穩步邁向『零廢堆填』及碳中和的目標，創建綠色未來。」

徐浩光博士表示，環保署會密切監察I·PARK1的試行運作，確保其運作和排放符合嚴格的安全和環保標準。隨着I·PARK1陸續投入服務，現時運往新界西及新界東北堆填區的都市固體廢物總量將會相應降低，舒緩兩個堆填區處理廢物的壓力。

二○二四年，香港都市固體廢物總棄置量為每日10 510公噸，I·PARK1及擬建的I·PARK2每日合共可處理9 000公噸固體廢物，若香港社會可以繼續減廢和增加回收量，可望無須興建第三個焚化爐而達到「零廢堆填」的目標。"

食環署持續落實規管私人泳池救生員措施,2025-12-22 15:00,2025-12-22 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200227.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）發言人今日（十二月二十二日）表示，為保障泳池使用者的安全，食環署自今年五月起實施一系列加強規管私人泳池救生員的措施，至今運作暢順並達致預期效果。食環署將持續推行該等措施。

截至十一月三十日，食環署今年於不同時段對全港逾1 400個持牌私人泳池進行約11 000次巡查，並透過中國香港拯溺總會核實超過5 000個救生員資格，當中發現一宗懷疑有救生員使用虛假救生員證件的個案。食環署已就事件報警，並就泳池開放期間未有提供足夠合資格救生員向有關泳池持牌人提出檢控。其後，該泳池持牌人因違反《泳池規例》（第132CA章第12條）在裁判法院被判罪名成立，罰款8,000元；而不合資格的救生員亦因欺詐罪及以欺騙手段取得金錢利益罪被警方起訴，在裁判法院被判罪名成立，判處監禁兩個月。此外，食環署亦發現兩宗懷疑未有提供足夠合資格救生員的個案，並已展開調查，如有足夠證據會提出檢控。同期，食環署人員在巡查期間就泳池持牌人違反與救生員有關的牌照條件共發出13個口頭警告，涉及未有在泳池入口展示在場當值的救生員數目及未有妥善填寫或保存救生員每日當值紀錄等。

發言人說：「整體而言，絕大部分泳池均遵守與救生員有關的規定，而食環署的巡查亦能有效找出違規個案。食環署會持續執行各項措施，保障泳池使用者的安全。」

發言人強調，泳池持牌人必須嚴格履行核實救生員資格的責任，確保泳池開放期間有足夠的合資格救生員當值。食環署提醒所有泳池持牌人，切勿聘用不合資格的救生員或容許使用虛假資格的救生員當值，並須嚴格遵守《泳池規例》（第132CA章）及其他牌照條件。如發現違規情況，署方會嚴肅跟進。

食環署自今年五月十九日起實施一系列加強規管私人泳池救生員的措施，包括在不同時段增加巡查頻次、規定持牌人在聘用救生員前須核對其身分證明文件並將其救生章和救生手冊的副本存檔、引入新懲處機制、加強與中國香港拯溺總會及物業管理業監管局合作等。"

FEHD continues to implement regulatory measures for life-saving attendants at private swimming pools,2025-12-22 15:00,2025-12-22 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200229.htm,"A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (December 22) that, to safeguard swimming pool users, the FEHD has implemented a series of enhancement measures regulating life-saving attendants at private swimming pools from May this year. The FEHD will continue to implement these measures, which have been operating smoothly to date and have achieved the intended results.

As at November 30, the FEHD had conducted approximately 11 000 inspections at various times of the day across over 1 400 licensed private swimming pools in Hong Kong, and had verified over 5 000 lifeguard qualifications through the Hong Kong China Life Saving Society (HKLSS) this year. One case involving suspected use of a fraudulent life-saving attendant certificate was identified. The FEHD reported it to the Police and prosecuted the swimming pool licensee for failing to provide a sufficient number of qualified life-saving attendants during pool opening hours. The licensee concerned was subsequently convicted by the magistrates' court for contravening the Swimming Pools Regulation (Section 12 of Cap. 132CA) and fined $8,000. The unqualified life-saving attendant who used the fraudulent qualification was also prosecuted by the Police and sentenced to two months' imprisonment for the offences of ""fraud"" and ""obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception"". In addition, two other suspected cases of insufficient provision of qualified life-saving attendants were found and the FEHD has initiated investigations. Prosecutions will be instituted should there be sufficient evidence. During the inspections over the same period, FEHD officers issued a total of 13 verbal warnings against licensees for violating the licensing conditions relating to life-saving attendants. These warnings involved failures to display at the pool entrances the number of life-saving attendants on duty and to properly complete or maintain life-saving attendants' daily duty records.

The spokesman said, ""Overall, most of the swimming pools were in compliance with the regulations relating to life-saving attendants, and the FEHD's inspections were effective in identifying suspected violations. The FEHD will continue to execute the measures to ensure the safety of swimming pool users.""

The spokesman stressed that swimming pool licensees are required to strictly fulfill their responsibility of verifying the qualifications of life-saving attendants and ensuring sufficient qualified life-saving attendants are on duty while the pool is open. The FEHD reminded all swimming pool licensees not to employ unqualified life-saving attendants or permit those with fraudulent qualifications to be on duty, and to strictly observe the Swimming Pools Regulation (Cap. 132CA) and other licensing conditions. The FEHD will take stringent follow-up actions against any violation identified.

Since May 19 this year, the FEHD has implemented a series of enhanced measures to strengthen the regulation of lifeguards at private swimming pools. These include stepping up inspection frequency at different times of the day, requiring licensees to verify the identity documents of life-saving attendants before employment and to keep copies of their Pool Lifeguard Awards and personal logbooks on proper record, introducing a new penalty mechanism and strengthening co-operation with HKLSS and the Property Management Services Authority."

環保署公布二○二四年廢物統計數字,2025-12-22 13:11,2025-12-22 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200311.htm,"​環境保護署（環保署）今日（十二月二十二日）公布「香港固體廢物監察報告——2024年的統計數字」。報告臚列二○二四年香港的固體廢物，包括都市固體廢物（涵蓋家居廢物和工商業廢物）、整體建築廢物及特殊廢物在棄置和回收或循環再造方面的統計數字。

香港都市固體廢物棄置量連續三年下跌，二○二四年為385萬公噸，平均每日10 510公噸，較二○二三年的每日10 884公噸減少3.4%。當中廢塑膠減少了11.1%；廚餘減少了6.0%；玻璃則下跌了7.1%。而都市固體廢物人均棄置量為每日1.40公斤，比二○二三年的每日1.44公斤按年下跌3.3%。在二○二四年棄置的都市固體廢物三大類別中，廚餘佔29%，其次是廢紙及廢塑膠，分別佔23%及18%。

隨着政府近年積極推行各項廚餘回收措施和推動多項「走塑」措施，包括二○二四年實施管制即棄塑膠法例，廚餘及廢塑膠所佔比重均較二○二三年下降。廢塑膠棄置量的跌幅亦正好反映近年全球「走塑」意識日益提升，以及政府積極推動多項相關措施的成效。政府二○二二年十二月三十一日優化塑膠購物袋收費計劃，二○二四年的數字顯示購物膠袋棄置量持續下降至56408公噸，較二○二三年的63367公噸減少11%。與此同時，廢紙的比重有所增加，主要是難以回收的雜紙。

都市固體廢物回收率連續四年上升，最新由二○二三年的33%升至二○二四年的34%，總回收量增加約5.0萬公噸，增長主要由廚餘（約2.6萬公噸）及含鐵金屬（約5.3萬公噸）所帶動。

環保署發言人指，為達致二○三五年「全民減廢‧資源循環‧零廢堆填」的願景，本屆政府著力推動綠色減廢回收文化，透過「綠在區區」社區回收網絡及廚餘回收網絡，推動市民積極參與減廢回收。最新統計數字顯示本屆政府成功扭轉廢物棄置量長期上升的趨勢，而回收率則持續上升，政府推動減廢回收的努力均取得顯著成效。

至於建築廢物方面，二○二四年建築廢物整體產生量較二○二三年每日增加約4 945公噸（11%）至平均每日50 505公噸。送往堆填區處理的建築廢物量輕微增加約6%，至約每日4 694公噸。同期主要承建商所完成的建造工程活動亦較二○二三年上升6.3%。然而，整體建築廢物重用率已超過90%，為平均每日45 810公噸。

政府會繼續透過宣傳教育、強化執法行動以及協助小型工程收集建築廢物的先導計劃，鼓勵小型工程將建築廢物作合規及付費的妥善棄置。環保署亦鼓勵私人企業將建築廢物升級再造，製成如環保磚、陶瓷製品及戶外鋪地等材料。土地方面，現時環保園已有企業營運建築廢物循環再造設施，環保署亦有為回收再用建築廢物提供短期租約用地。此外，回收基金亦資助不同企業的建築廢物升級再造項目。

展望未來，政府會把握愈來愈多市民參與減廢回收的契機，進一步推動社會建立綠色減廢回收文化，並會循四個方向繼續推動減少廢物和分類回收，包括（一）多用宣傳教育，改變市民行為，打造綠色生活文化；（二）持續完善回收網絡；（三）緊密與行業協作，共同探索和推進務實可行的環境保護措施；以及（四）善用市場力量發展環境基建，協助綠色經濟轉型。

同時，政府正全力發展先進高效的現代轉廢為能設施網絡，首座處理都市固體廢物的轉廢為能設施I·PARK1於今年年底開始陸續投入服務；政府亦正全力推展第二座轉廢為能設施I·PARK2的籌備工作，擴大轉廢為能的容量，配合特區政府推動市民努力實踐減廢回收，向「零廢堆填」的目標穩步邁進。

Waste statistics for 2024 published,2025-12-22 13:11,2025-12-22 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200312.htm,"The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (December 22) published the report ""Monitoring of Solid Waste in Hong Kong - Waste Statistics for 2024"". It presents the 2024 statistics on disposal and recovery/recycling of solid waste generated in Hong Kong, including municipal solid waste (MSW) (covering both domestic waste and commercial and industrial waste), overall construction waste and special waste.

The total quantity of MSW disposed of at landfills has dropped for three consecutive years to 3.85 million tonnes in 2024, and the average daily quantity was 10 510 tonnes, representing a decrease of 3.4 per cent comparing with the average of 10 884 tonnes in 2023. Among these, disposal of waste plastics has dropped by 11.1 per cent; disposal of food waste has dropped by 6.0 per cent; disposal of waste glass has decreased by 7.1 per cent. The per capita MSW disposal rate per day was 1.40 kilograms, down from 1.44 kilograms in 2023 by 3.3 per cent. Among the three major categories of MSW in 2024, food waste accounted for 29 per cent, followed by waste paper and waste plastics, accounting for 23 per cent and 18 per cent respectively.

With the implementation of various measures by the Government in promoting food waste recycling and plastic-free culture, including the implementation of the regulation on disposable plastic products in 2024, both the shares of disposal of food waste and waste plastics had decreased compared to 2023. The drop in the disposal amount of waste plastics also reflected the increasing global awareness of being ""plastic-free"" in recent years and the effectiveness of the Government's active promotion of various related measures. Since the Government enhanced the Plastic Shopping Bag Charging Scheme on December 31, 2022, the amount of plastic shopping bags disposed in 2024 has dropped to 56 408 tonnes, down from 63 367 tonnes in 2023 by 11 per cent. Meanwhile, the share of waste paper has increased; this was mainly paper waste other than cardboard, newsprint, office paper or tetrapak that could not be easily recycled.

The overall MSW recovery rate has risen for four consecutive years. The latest figures show that it rose from 33 per cent in 2023 to 34 per cent in 2024 and the increase in the total recovery amount was about 50000 tonnes. The increase was mainly driven by the recycling of food waste (around 26000 tonnes) and ferrous metal recyclables (around 53000 tonnes).

An EPD spokesperson said that in order to achieve the vision of ""Waste Reductionâ§Resources Circulationâ§Zero Landfill"" by 2035, the current term Government is working at full steam to promote the culture of waste reduction and recovery, and to encourage active participation in waste reduction by citizens through the community recycling network GREEN@COMMUNITY and the food waste collection network. The latest statistics show that the current-term Government has successfully reversed the long-term upward trend in waste disposal quantities. The recovery rate showed a continuous upward trend, reflecting the achievements of the Government's persistent effort in promoting waste reduction and recovery.

Regarding construction waste, the overall quantity of construction waste generation in 2024 increased by about 4 945 tonnes per day (11 per cent) as compared to 2023, to 50 505 tonnes per day on average. The quantity of construction waste disposed of at landfills increased slightly by 6 per cent to about 4 694 tonnes per day. The construction activities performed by the main contractors in the same period increased by 6.3% compared to 2023. The overall construction waste recovery rate was above 90 per cent; the average quantity of construction waste reused was 45 810 tonnes per day.

The Government will continue to encourage small-scale works to properly dispose of construction waste in a compliant and paid manner through publicity and education, strengthened enforcement actions, as well as a pilot scheme to assist with collection of construction waste. The EPD also encourages private enterprises to upcycle construction waste into products like eco-blocks, ceramic products and outdoor paving materials. In terms of land, there is an enterprise operating construction waste recycling facilities in the EcoPark, and the EPD has also provided land for short-term lease for the purpose of recycling construction waste. Moreover, the Recycling Fund has also subsidised different enterprises' projects on upcycling of construction waste.

Looking ahead, seizing the opportunity of increasing public participation in waste reduction and recycling, the Government will further promote a green waste reduction and recycling culture in society and will take forward waste reduction and recycling initiatives along four directions, namely: (1) Strengthen publicity and education to change public behaviour and cultivate a green living culture; (2) Continue to enhance the recycling network; (3) Strengthen collaboration with industries to explore and take forward practical environmental protection measures; (4) Utilise market forces to develop environmental infrastructure and assist in the transition to a green economy.

In the meantime, the Government is building an advanced and efficient network of modern waste-to-energy facilities at full steam. The first waste-to-energy facility for treating municipal solid waste, Integrated Waste Management Facilities Phase 1 (I·PARK1), commenced operation at the end of this year; and the Government is also working in full steam on the preparation work for Integrated Waste Management Facility Phase 2 (I·PARK2) to expand waste-to-energy capacity. The goal is to achieve zero landfill with the efforts of the HKSAR Government and citizens.

Remarks by STL on traffic conditions on first working day following commissioning of Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section) at media session,2025-12-22 12:55,2025-12-22 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200324.htm,"Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at a media session today (December 22) with the Director of Highways, Mr Tony Yau, after inspecting the traffic conditions on the first working day following the commissioning of the Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section):

Secretary for Transport and Logistics: Following the successful commissioning of the Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section) yesterday, by now we have seen a total of 50 000 vehicles of traffic throughput at this bypass. The overall traffic condition is smooth. We noticed a significant improvement in the diversion effect of the bypass in improving the traffic conditions along the Gascoigne Road Flyover and other major roads in the Kowloon district. We appeal to various road users to take care of road safety and to pay attention to the road signs. In general, the usage of the bypass is smooth.

As we can see from media reports, there were different kinds of road users using the bypass yesterday, including pet buses, open-deck buses and motorcyclists. From media reports, we can also see that every citizen shared the joy and excitement of using this bypass. The successful launch of this bypass represents not only a significant improvement in the traffic conditions but also the ingenious efforts of various engineers, contractors and consultants throughout the years in constructing and designing this infrastructure.

In particular, we have to thank the Legislative Council for providing staunch support for us in monitoring the overall construction of this infrastructure. We have invited previous, incumbent and also Members-elect of the Legislative Council to our ceremony yesterday. With the success of the Legislative Council election, we look forward to continuing our collaboration with the Members-elect of the Legislative Council in order to further improve the development of traffic infrastructure in Hong Kong, which is very important to the economic development of the whole society.

Thank you very much.

​運輸及物流局局長與路政署署長就中九龍繞道（油麻地段）通車後首個工作天交通情況會見傳媒談話內容,2025-12-22 12:55,2025-12-22 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200332.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（十二月二十二日）上午視察中九龍繞道（油麻地段）通車後首個工作天交通情況後，與路政署署長邱國鼎會見傳媒的談話內容：

運輸及物流局局長：早晨，各位傳媒朋友、各位市民。中九龍繞道（油麻地段）昨日（十二月二十一日）通車，今日迎來首個工作天，至今已有逾五萬車次使用中九龍繞道（油麻地段）。我看到今早的交通情況大致暢順，符合預期。由於繞道扮演分流的角色，亦能貫穿九龍區東、西走向的交通道路，所以我們觀察到加士居道天橋、龍翔道一帶九龍區主要幹道的交通情況有很明顯改善，相當暢順。運輸署緊急事故交通協調中心自星期六（十二月二十日）晚上已提升至最高級別的督導模式，至今一直監察着整體交通狀況，我們一定會繼續密切留意交通情況。

我們留意到昨日繞道通車後，不少駕駛人士和公共交通車輛均有使用繞道，初時大家都需要多適應路況，亦要留意指示牌。公共交通方面，今日起有八條專營巴士路線途經繞道，至今已有16班巴士開出，包括由將軍澳往機場的數班機場巴士，乘客量不俗。我在此再次呼籲大家，使用繞道時一定要確保道路安全。我稍後會請路政署署長向大家匯報，我們經考慮整日的運作情況後，如何在交通路牌和指示方面作出優化和加強。

路政署署長：如局長剛才提到，中九龍繞道（油麻地段）其實是一條策略性道路，每邊無論在油麻地方向及啟德九龍灣方向，其實都有多個出口，每邊達到四個出口。我們看到昨日都真是需要時間讓駕駛者適應，初步看到昨日駕駛者（遇到的情況），其實最主要在中九龍繞道啟德九龍灣段出口，我們建議有三大改善方向。

第一，由於有四個出口，從左邊往啟德九龍灣，然後觀塘繞道，跟着兩條線去郵輪碼頭，雖然我們本來有足夠指示交通標誌，但我們決定為了方便駕駛者看到，我們會在路面做多一個道路標記，就是加在路面四條行車線上，就是左邊的啟德九龍灣、觀塘繞道和兩個往郵輪碼頭。我們會髹兩組，第一組剛剛在昨晚已大部分完成。第二組在差不多近行政大樓，會於今晚完成。即是說，明早除兩組交通標誌外，還有道路標記，提醒駕駛者選定適當行車線。

第二，大家留意到在啟福道，由於在啟德隧道出來的車輛已經不能再直接上觀塘繞道，而是要經常怡道及宏照道到觀塘繞道。我們留意到有些車輛入了巴士線再上觀塘繞道。我們在巴士線前加了一對警告交通標誌，是紅底白字的一對（標誌）於兩旁，提醒（駕駛者）前面有巴士專線，其他車輛不准駛入。我們看到今早的情況，配合警察執法，情況已有改善。

第三，在九龍灣方面。九龍灣入口處，有兩條隧道供駕駛者選擇，分別是啟德隧道及中九龍繞道。由於有兩個隧道標誌，我們會再在適當位置提醒（駕駛者有）該兩條隧道（選擇），譬如是去油麻地、啟德，或者經啟德隧道，可能會標示所經的隧道。

這三大改善方向我們會繼續做，如剛才所述，第二組道路標記會在今晚完成；啟福道巴士線交通標誌已經完成；而提醒（駕駛者）選用隧道的指示交通標誌，我們希望在這幾日短時間內加強。

記者：繞道落成後，估計由西隧經中九龍幹線進入觀塘的車流量是多少？如果車流不多，會否考慮開放啟福道右線，改劃為單白線，讓啟德隧道車輛駛上觀塘繞道？

運輸及物流局局長：今日是中九龍繞道（油麻地段）開通第二日，是一個工作天，由於臨近年底，部分學校或已開始放假，所以我們要密切留意實際交通情況。正如路政署署長剛才提到，繞道的啟德出口有接近八個出口，我們要做好分流。在啟德方面，尤其是啟福道及通往九龍灣區域方面，我們亦就相應路口和交通燈作出調整，並及早準備預案，以配合調整的路線。我們會繼續密切留意交通情況，期望道路使用者能因應出行需要，享受暢順的交通安排。

記者：剛才訪問了一些巴士乘客，今日是通車後首個工作天，他們表示巴士在進入繞道前有慢行和輕微擠塞的情況，並非他們預期之內。現時正值年底，小朋友不用上學，會否擔心未來分流的效果未如理想，繞道會出現擠塞？政府屆時會有甚麼應對措施？另外，昨日有意見反映路牌的文字較多及較細，除了地面會再加標示外，路牌會否有改善？

運輸及物流局局長：中九龍繞道（油麻地段）是一條主要的分流幹道，由於車速高，且屬一條直接連接的幹道，能發揮很好的分流功能，有很大吸引力。繞道通車後，使油麻地至啟德的車程由以往30分鐘大大縮減至五分鐘，因此在最初規劃繞道時，我們已預期會有一定的交通需求。整體而言，繞道日後會實施收費安排。目前我們因應繁忙時段加設專營巴士路線途經繞道，為市民提供兩個選擇：部分專營巴士的路線會經繞道行駛，亦有路線經太子道或亞皆老街，讓乘客可有不同選擇。整體交通情況是動態的，路政署及運輸署會繼續密切留意交通情況及乘客需求，以便我們更好地作出回應及優化交通安排。

記者：留意到今早有警員在啟福道巴士線截停一些違例車輛，現時警察會如何處理，會提出勸喻抑或執法？既然這麼多車輛需要由啟福道上觀塘繞道，會否改善這個問題？另外，我們看到有很多車輛在啟德出口行錯路、切雙白線的情況，會否考慮加設緩衝區和劃多些虛線，使車輛可以及早改道，以改善情況？

運輸及物流局局長：關於啟德出口，我們昨晚已在隧道內路面加強標示，讓駕駛者可預早留意到交通路牌，從而選取適合的路線。我們亦已在隧道出口，即啟福道附近加裝一些警告標示，讓駕駛者留意，以避免錯誤駛進巴士專線。我們很感謝警方一直配合繞道的通車，並在通車後首個工作天安排警員協助留意現場情況，最主要是確保道路安全。我們會繼續審視情況，未來一、兩日持續和加快優化及加強路牌指示的安排。我亦很感謝團隊能快速作出應變。

記者：有關巴士專線方面，不少司機反映設計造成不便，他們似乎並非不知道巴士專線的安排，而是貪快而越過雙白線。其實這個設計的原本目的是甚麼？車輛要駛至九龍灣MegaBox的位置才出觀塘繞道，會否擔心加劇MegaBox附近塞車情況？

運輸及物流局局長：首先，巴士專線是為確保專營巴士的出行安全，我在此呼籲駕駛者要留意巴士專線的安排，注意駕駛安全。我們已加設警示路牌，正正能協助駕駛者避免錯誤地切入巴士專線。藉着中九龍繞道（油麻地段）通車，我們在啟福道作的分流安排，是為改善九龍灣MegaBox一帶以往出現的交通擠塞情況。運輸署和路政署於數月前已分別在該處一帶作出交通改善措施，調整交通燈訊號，希望車輛駛入九龍灣地段時會較以往暢順，這亦回應了過去一些地區人士提出的意見，今次我們則一併去做。始終今日仍是通車第二日，我們希望駕駛人士保持耐性、小心出行。我們會一直觀察他們的駕駛情況，密切和動態地留意安排。接下來隨着交通標示的加強，交通情況有望更安全和暢順。

"DH accepts applications for one-on-one pre-new drug application meetings under ""1+"" mechanism",2025-12-22 12:28,2025-12-22 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200283.htm,"  The Department of Health (DH) announced today (December 22) that potential applicants for new drugs registration through the ""1+"" mechanism may now request one-on-one pre-new drug application (NDA) meetings with immediate effect. This service aims to further optimise the new drug registration approval process by working with the pharmaceutical industry to achieve the goals of early consultation to enhance quality and efficiency throughout the process so that registration approval can be expedited in Hong Kong. It will consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international health and medical innovation hub.

Consultation service for new drug applications under ""1+"" mechanism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The introduction of the consultation service under the ""1+"" mechanism will enhance efficiency in processing applications. The consultation service comprises three components, namely briefing seminars, workshops and pre-NDA meetings.
  
  There are two types of pre-NDA meetings that provide tailored services and appropriate support for applicants with different needs. These meetings help potential applicants plan their applications earlier and more comprehensively, while streamlining the submission process. Details are as follows:


Company-oriented: Meetings are specifically for first-time applicants through the ""1+"" mechanism. DH professionals will provide tailored advice and guidance on applicable drug registration categories and application pathways based on the applicant company's profiles and potential registration applications; and
	
Product-specific: Meetings are tailored to specific new drug registration projects. DH professionals will provide concrete advice on the supporting evidence, procedures and documentation required for the particular new drug registration.


Information on how to apply for one-on-one pre-NDA meetings has been uploaded on the ""1+"" mechanism thematic webpage. To encourage the industry to experience the one-on-one pre-NDA meetings, no fees will be charged for this service at this stage. The DH will actively maintain communication with the industry to gather feedback and suggestions regarding the one-on-one pre-NDA meetings.

Since March of this year, the DH has organised seven briefing seminars to brief the trade and stakeholders on the basic requirements and procedures for Hong Kong drug registration under the ""1+"" mechanism. The DH has also organised three workshops to provide guidance and share good practices and real-life experiences on submitting applications through the ""1+"" mechanism. These seminars and workshops have been well received by over 580 representatives from pharmaceutical companies, consultancy firms and research institutes, etc, in and outside Hong Kong. The DH has uploaded the detailed arrangements and briefing materials for the seminar to the thematic webpage on the ""1+"" mechanism. The DH will continue to organise workshops and briefing seminars as needed based on feedback from the industry.

Paving the way towards primary evaluation
------------------------------------------------

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has implemented the ""1+"" mechanism since November 1, 2023, and has extended it to all new drugs from November 1 last year, including all new chemical or biological entities and new indications, and vaccines and advanced therapy products. Under the ""1+"" mechanism, new drugs which are supported by local clinical data and recognised by local relevant experts can be applied for registration in Hong Kong by submitting approval from the drug regulatory authority of one of the reference places (instead of two in the past).

Since the implementation of the ""1+"" mechanism, a total of 16 new drugs have been approved under this mechanism. Seven of them have been listed in the Hospital Authority Drug Formulary. The DH has been promoting the ""1+"" mechanism through different channels and so far has received more than 700 enquiries from over 180 pharmaceutical companies (including those from the Chinese Mainland and overseas).

  The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address announced that the HKSAR Government will accelerate the reform of the regulatory system for drugs and medical devices. The DH will continue to expedite the ""1+"" mechanism for new drugs by piloting the priority evaluation and approval of innovative drugs as recommended by the Hospital Authority for treatment of severe or rare diseases and to accelerate patients' use of the advanced treatments. In addition, the DH will establish the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation by the end of 2026, and will implement ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration in phases beginning in 2026. These efforts will provide strong momentum for the development and market expansion of the healthcare industry in the HKSAR, the Chinese Mainland, and beyond."

粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所邁進新里程　真實世界研究及應用中心正式成立並同步啓動粵港澳大灣區臨床試驗協作平台,2025-12-22 10:30,2025-12-22 10:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200199.htm,"醫務衞生局今日（十二月二十二日）公布，由香港特別行政區政府設立並全資擁有的「粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所」（試驗所）正式成立「真實世界研究及應用中心」（中心），並同步啓動「粵港澳大灣區臨床試驗協作平台」（協作平台），標誌着試驗所繼去年與深圳粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗中心以「一所一中心」模式同步成立後，在推動粵港澳大灣區生物醫藥領域協同發展方面再邁出重要一步。

中心將善用香港獨有的醫療數據優勢，提升健康和醫療數據庫的存取與應用，並整合在「港澳藥械通」政策下產生的真實世界數據，以支援創新藥械在香港、內地及海外的註冊申請，加速產品研發、審批及上市。截至今年十二月十日，「港澳藥械通」指定內地醫療機構（共71間）引進港澳已上市藥械品種共140種，包括63種藥品及77種醫療器械，惠及超過1.7萬人次。

為積極推動大灣區多中心臨床試驗與真實世界研究的發展，試驗所早已展開前瞻性部署。其中，試驗所在今年九月九日已經與香港大學李嘉誠醫學院及國際生物製藥公司葛蘭素史克簽署三方合作備忘錄，啓動試驗所首個真實世界數據研究項目。該項目將以香港為起點，並計劃逐步擴展至澳門及深圳等大灣區城市。在該項目下，中心將致力探索運用大灣區醫療數據支持藥物在內地註冊上市的創新路徑，從而加速創新醫療產品的研發與審批進程。項目目前正處於方案籌備階段，預計於明年第二季度正式啓動數據收集，標誌着香港在建設真實世界研究國際樞紐，以及就促進大灣區醫療數據互聯互通方面邁出關鍵一步。

此外，中心會積極推動數據應用以支援實證決策，從而優化治療方案和提升醫療系統效能，並將香港定位為真實世界研究的領先地區與國際樞紐，吸引全球合作與投資。中心的服務範疇包括：（一）利用真實世界數據評估研究可行性及為臨床試驗識別合適的研究中心；（二）為在香港及大灣區其他城市進行的真實世界研究提供全面的一站式項目管理；以及（三）提供真實世界研究領域的專家諮詢、專業培訓與能力建設等。

同步啓動的協作平台是「一所一中心」共同建立的統一服務門戶，旨在整合大灣區臨床試驗資源，為全球的生物醫藥企業、研發機構及研究人員提供一站式服務入口。協作平台將統一處理來自海內外的服務請求，透過構建中的香港臨床試驗資訊平台，按具體需求精準配對合適的研究機構與研究者。平台亦提供涵蓋醫藥學、統計、法規事務及倫理審查的全方位專家諮詢。在此框架下，試驗所將致力推動創新療法的臨床試驗，重點聚焦於罕見病藥、高端腫瘤藥，以及細胞與基因療法等先進療法製品。此外，協作平台亦將擔當多重角色，包括作為收集、儲存和分析真實世界數據的主要樞紐，並推動試點項目；作為資訊中心，建立「大灣區臨床研究人才儲備庫」，提供包括《藥物臨牀試驗質量管理規範》及先進療法等專業培訓課程；長遠更會透過建立深港協同機制，定期交換審查標準，探索倫理審查互認的可能性，以提升審批效率。

試驗所將會更好地結合大灣區的完整生物醫藥技術研發及科技產業鏈，善用國家惠港的特別政策如「港澳藥械通」和相關跨境便利措施，充分發揮香港「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的「超級聯繫人」作用，推動河套成為創新生物醫藥成果轉化「引進來、走出去」的窗口，加快大灣區病人獲得先進診療，發展新質生產力。"
GBA International Clinical Trial Institute reaches new milestone with official establishment of Real-World Study and Application Centre and simultaneous launch of GBA Clinical Trial Collaboration Platform,2025-12-22 10:30,2025-12-22 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200201.htm,"  The Health Bureau announced today (December 22) that the Greater Bay Area (GBA) International Clinical Trial Institute (GBAICTI), established and wholly owned by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, officially established the Real-World Study and Application Centre (RWSAC), and simultaneously launched the GBA Clinical Trial Collaboration Platform. This marks another significant step forward in promoting the co-ordinated development of the biomedical field in the GBA, following the simultaneous establishment of the GBAICTI and the GBA International Clinical Trials Center in Shenzhen under the ""one institute, one center"" model last year.

  The RWSAC will leverage Hong Kong's unique advantages in medical data to enhance access to and the application of health and medical databases, and integrate real-world data generated under the special measure of using Hong Kong-registered drugs and medical devices used in Hong Kong public hospitals in the GBA (the Measure), with a view to supporting registration applications for innovative drugs and medical devices in Hong Kong, the Mainland and overseas, thereby accelerating product research and development (R&D), approval and market launch. As of December 10 this year, designated Mainland healthcare institutions (71 in total) under the Measure have introduced a total of 140 drug and medical device products listed in Hong Kong and Macao, comprising 63 drugs and 77 medical devices, benefiting over 17 000 patient visits.

  To actively promote the development of multicentre clinical trials and real-world studies in the GBA, the GBAICTI has already commenced forward-looking planning; such as signing a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding with the LKS Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong and the international biopharmaceutical company GSK on September 9 this year to launch the GBAICTI's first real-world data research project. The project will start in Hong Kong and plans to gradually expand to other GBA cities such as Macao and Shenzhen. The RWSAC will strive to explore innovative pathways for using GBA medical data to support drug registration and market entry on the Mainland under the project, thereby accelerating the R&D and approval processes for innovative medical products. The project is currently in the protocol preparation stage, with data collection expected to officially commence in the second quarter next year, marking a critical step for Hong Kong in becoming an international hub for real-world studies and promoting the interconnectivity of medical data in the GBA.

  In addition, the RWSAC will actively promote data application to support evidence-based decision-making, thereby optimising treatment strategies and enhancing healthcare system efficiency, and position Hong Kong as a leading region and international hub for real-world studies to attract global collaboration and investment. The scope of services of the RWSAC includes: (i) utilising real-world data to assess research feasibility and identify suitable research centres for clinical trials; (ii) providing comprehensive one-stop project management for real-world studies conducted in Hong Kong and other GBA cities; and (iii) offering expert consultation, professional training and capacity building in the field of real-world studies.

  The simultaneously launched Collaboration Platform is a unified service portal jointly established by the ""one institute, one center"", aiming to integrate GBA clinical trial resources and provide a one-stop service entry point for global biomedical enterprises, R&D institutions and researchers. The Collaboration Platform will centrally handle service requests from the Mainland and overseas, and precisely match suitable research institutions and researchers based on specific needs through the Hong Kong Clinical Trial Digital Portal currently under construction. The platform also provides comprehensive expert consultation covering medicine, statistics, regulatory affairs and ethics review. Under this framework, the GBAICTI will strive to promote clinical trials of innovative therapies, focusing on rare disease drugs, high-end cancer drugs, and advanced therapy products such as cell and gene therapies. Furthermore, the Collaboration Platform will take on multiple roles, including serving as a key hub for collecting, storing and analysing real-world data and promoting pilot projects; acting as an information centre to establish a GBA clinical research talent pool and providing professional training courses including the Good Clinical Practice and advanced therapies. In the long run, it will help explore the possibility of the mutual recognition of ethics reviews through establishing a Shenzhen-Hong Kong collaborative mechanism and regularly exchanging review standards to enhance approval efficiency.

  The GBAICTI will better integrate with the complete biomedical technology R&D and technology industry chain in the GBA, leverage the nation's special policy initiatives benefitting Hong Kong such as the Measure and relevant cross-boundary facilitation measures, and give full play to Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world. It will promote the Hetao area as a window for translation of innovative biomedical research results to go global and attract foreign investment, expedite GBA patients' access to advanced treatments, and develop new quality productive forces."

A male passenger, aged 23, arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds concealed inside vacuum-sealed bags in his check-in suitcase. He was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The cases will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (December 22).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

一名二十三歲的男旅客昨日從泰國曼谷飛抵本港。海關人員清關時，在其寄艙行李內發現該批藏於真空包裝袋的懷疑大麻花，該名人士隨即被捕。

被捕人士已被控一項販運危險藥物罪，案件將於明日（十二月二十二日）在西九龍裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。

海關會繼續根據風險管理的原則，重點揀選來自高風險地區的旅客作清關檢查，確保有效打擊跨境販毒活動。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。
