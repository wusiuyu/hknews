響應子宮頸癌關注月　積極預防子宮頸癌,2026-01-02 12:32,2026-01-02 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010200254.htm,"​衞生署今日（一月二日）呼籲市民透過實踐健康生活模式及採取有效預防子宮頸癌的方法，包括接種人類乳頭瘤病毒（簡稱HPV）疫苗及定期接受子宮頸篩查，響應子宮頸癌關注月。

衞生署衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「政府非常重視癌症防控工作，一直透過疫苗、普查和篩查等方式，實現『早預防、早發現、早治療』的目標。自二○○四年起推行子宮頸普查計劃，並自二○一九年起將HPV疫苗接種納入香港兒童免疫接種計劃，過去幾年一直維持約九成的極高接種率，大大減低香港女性患上子宮頸癌的機會。衞生署更於二○二四年十二月開展一次性HPV疫苗補種計劃，至今已接種超過48 000劑疫苗。政府亦將進一步擴大子宮頸篩查服務，鼓勵更多婦女接受篩查，保障健康。」

世界衞生組織（世衞）轄下的國際癌症研究機構將每年的一月定為子宮頸癌關注月，目標是透過提升大眾對子宮頸癌的意識及提倡預防措施，以期在下世紀把子宮頸癌這一公共衞生問題消除。

在香港，子宮頸癌是二○二三年第七常見的女性癌症，於女性致命癌症中排第九位。大部分子宮頸癌由持續感染高風險的HPV引致。政府建議婦女在未有性行為前接種HPV疫苗、定期進行子宮頸篩查、進行安全性行為（例如使用安全套及避免有多個性伴侶）以預防感染HPV。此外，吸煙會增加患上子宮頸癌的風險，因此應避免吸煙。

HPV疫苗
————

徐樂堅醫生說：「接種HPV疫苗是預防子宮頸癌最有效的措施之一，尤其在婦女未感染病毒前（即未有性行為前），疫苗能發揮最佳效能。自二○一九／二○學年起，衞生署在香港兒童免疫接種計劃下，為合資格的小五女童免費接種HPV疫苗。衞生署的學童免疫注射小組會到學校為就讀小學五年級的女童接種第一劑疫苗，並於翌學年女童升讀六年級時接種第二劑。二○二四／二五學年小六女童的第二劑HPV疫苗覆蓋率已達92%。」

衞生署於二○二四年十二月開展一次性HPV疫苗補種計劃，為二○○四年至二○○八年出生、尚未完成接種HPV疫苗的女性香港居民提供免費補種。合資格人士只需先登記「醫健通」，便可透過網頁或致電2855 1333預約於醫務衞生局基層醫療署轄下的樂妍站或指定地區康健中心／站免費接種HPV疫苗。計劃為期約兩年，詳情可瀏覽衞生署網頁。

子宮頸篩查
—————

HPV感染或早期子宮頸癌可能沒有任何明顯症狀。因此，25至64歲曾有性經驗的婦女應定期進行子宮頸篩查。市民可透過衞生署網頁了解子宮頸篩查相關資訊。衞生署亦定期透過子宮頸普查資訊系統和醫健通流動應用程式向適齡婦女發出通知，提醒她們定期接受篩查。

衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、樂妍站、非政府機構及私營醫護服務提供者都有提供子宮頸篩查服務。常見的子宮頸篩查方法包括以醫護人員採集的子宮頸樣本進行HPV檢測及／或子宮頸細胞檢驗（又稱子宮頸抹片或柏氏抹片）。世衞亦建議透過自行採集陰道樣本進行HPV檢測是子宮頸篩查的另一可靠方法。自二○二四年起，11間母嬰健康院進行HPV自行採樣檢測先導計劃及研究，探討陰道HPV自我採樣的可行性和接受程度。此外，樂妍站計劃在二○二六年第一季推出HPV自行採樣檢測計劃，詳情將稍後於樂妍站網頁公布。

值得留意的是，本港乃至國際間目前尚未有充分科學證據支持使用自行採集經血或尿液樣本作子宮頸篩查。衞生署會持續檢視最新科學實證。

婦女如計劃在母嬰健康院進行子宮頸篩查，可透過24小時熱線3166 6631預約，或聯絡樂妍站（網頁）或十八區地區康健中心／站（網頁）預約包括子宮頸癌篩查在內的個人化女性基層醫療服務。更多有關子宮頸癌和篩查的資訊，請瀏覽衞生署網頁。

健康人生計劃
——————

與此同時，基層醫療署積極推廣健康人生計劃，以預防為本、全人照護為核心，並參考最新實證，為市民制訂不同人生階段的個人化健康策略。家庭醫生及基層醫療專業人員將攜手合作，根據年齡、性別、家族史等個人因素，提供慢性病及癌症篩查、健康生活方式指導等服務。樂妍站提供個人化女性基層醫療服務，包括健康評估、個別諮詢、子宮頸癌及乳癌篩查等，並在有需要時轉介至家庭醫生跟進。"
Take action to prevent cervical cancer in support of Cervical Cancer Awareness Month,2026-01-02 12:32,2026-01-02 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010200257.htm,"​The Department of Health (DH) today (January 2) urged members of the public to support Cervical Cancer Awareness Month by adopting healthy lifestyles and taking effective precautionary measures against cervical cancer, including receiving the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and undergoing regular cervical screening.

  ""The Government attaches great importance to cancer prevention and control. We have consistently pursued the goal of 'early prevention, early detection and early treatment' through vaccination. The Cervical Screening Programme has been launched since 2004. HPV vaccination has been included under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme (HKCIP) since 2019, and a high vaccination rate of about 90 per cent has been maintained in recent years. This significantly lowers the risk of cervical cancer in Hong Kong females. The DH also launched a one-off HPV Vaccination Catch-up Programme in December 2024, with over 48 000 doses administered so far. The Government will further expand cervical screening services to encourage more women to undergo screening and safeguard their health,"" said Dr Edwin Tsui, the Controller of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization (WHO) designated January as Cervical Cancer Awareness Month to raise awareness and motivate actions against cervical cancer, with the goal of eliminating this public health concern within the next century.

In Hong Kong, cervical cancer was the seventh most common female cancer in 2023 and the ninth leading cause of cancer deaths among females. As most cervical cancers are caused by persistent infection with high-risk HPV, women are recommended to receive HPV vaccination before having sexual relations, undergo regular cervical screenings and practise safe sex (such as using condoms and avoiding multiple sexual partners) to prevent HPV infection. In addition, smoking should be avoided as it can increase the risk of cervical cancer.

HPV vaccination
--------------------

  ""HPV vaccination is among the most effective measures for cervical cancer prevention, especially for those who have never been exposed to HPV infection, i.e. before their first sexual encounter. Since the 2019/20 school year, the DH has been providing free HPV vaccinations to eligible Primary 5 schoolgirls under the HKCIP. The DH's School Immunisation Teams provide the first dose of vaccine to Primary 5 female students at their schools, and the second dose will be given to them when they reach Primary 6 during the following school year. The second dose coverage rates of HPV vaccination for Primary 6 girls in the school year 2024/25 has reached 92 per cent,"" Dr Tsui said.

In December 2024, the DH launched a one-off HPV Vaccination Catch-up Programme, offering free catch-up vaccinations to female Hong Kong residents born between 2004 and 2008 who have not completed their HPV vaccination. Eligible persons only need to register with eHealth, and can schedule an appointment through the website or by calling 2855 1333 to receive a free HPV vaccination at Women Wellness Satellites (WWSs) or designated District Health Centres (DHCs)/DHC Expresses (DHCEs) under the Primary Healthcare Commission of the Health Bureau. The programme is to last for about two years. Details can be found on the DH's website.

Cervical screening
----------------------

Infection with HPV or early stages of cervical cancer may not have any noticeable symptoms. Therefore, women aged 25 to 64 who have had sexual experience should undergo regular cervical screenings. Members of the public can access information about cervical screenings via the DH website. The DH also regularly sends reminders to eligible women via the Cervical Screening Information System and the eHealth mobile app to schedule their screenings.

Cervical screening services are available at Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) of the DH, WWSs, as well as through non-governmental organisations and private healthcare providers. Common screening methods include HPV testing and/or a cytology examination (also called a cervical smear or pap smear) performed by healthcare professionals. The WHO has also recommended vaginal self-sampling for HPV testing as another reliable method for cervical screening. Starting in 2024, the DH initiated HPV testing of self-collected samples at 11 MCHCs to study the feasibility and acceptability of vaginal HPV self-sampling locally. Moreover, HPV testing of self-collected samples is planned to be rolled out in WWSs in the first quarter of 2026. Details will be announced later on the WWS's website.

It is important to note that there is currently insufficient scientific evidence in Hong Kong or internationally to support the use of self-collected menstrual blood or urine samples for cervical screenings. The DH will continue to review the latest scientific evidence.

Women who wish to receive a cervical screening at MCHCs can schedule an appointment through the 24-hour hotline at 3166 6631, or contact WWSs via itswebsiteor 18 DHCs/DHCEs (website) for personalised primary healthcare services for women including cervical cancer screening. For further information on cervical cancer and screenings, please visit the DH's website.

Life course preventive care plan
--------------------------------------

At the same time, the Primary Healthcare Commission is actively promoting the life course preventive care plan. Based on the core principles of prevention-oriented and whole-person care, a personalised preventive care plan will be formulated to address the health needs of citizens across different life stages with reference to the latest evidence. Family doctors and primary healthcare professionals will collaborate to provide health advice and education on chronic diseases and cancer screening as well as healthy lifestyles according to age, sex and personal factors such as family history. The WWSs offer personalised primary healthcare services for women, including health assessments, individual consultations, cervical cancer and breast cancer screenings, etc and will refer cases to family doctors for follow-ups when necessary."

Reclamation works at Lung Kwu Tan proposed,2026-01-02 12:30,2026-01-02 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010200299.htm,"The Government proposes to carry out reclamation works within an area of about 240 hectares of foreshore and seabed at Lung Kwu Tan. The extent of the area of foreshore and seabed affected is described in a noticegazetted today (January 2).

The proposed works include filling of the seabed to form about 145 hectares of land, reprovisioning of a submarine outfall, and construction of a seawall. The proposed works are tentatively scheduled to commence in 2028.

The notice and its related plan are posted near the site. The plan is also available for inspection at:

* Survey and Mapping Office of the Lands Department (6/F, North Point Government Offices, 333 Java Road, North Point, Hong Kong) (where copies can be purchased on order);

New round of tenders invited for Standing Offer Agreement for supply of IT professional services to government departments,2026-01-02 09:30,2026-01-02 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010100396.htm,"  The Digital Policy Office (DPO) today (January 2) gazetted a notice to invite tenders for the provision of professional services to undertake information technology (IT) projects in the Government under thenew round of the Standing Offer Agreement for Quality Professional Services (SOA-QPS) scheme for a period of 48 months. Interested tenderers must submit their tenders by noon on January 30, 2026 (Friday).

  ""The new round of the SOA-QPS scheme introduces several new measures to promote the development of the local IT industry. These include increasing the maximum number of standing offer agreements that can be awarded to allow more service providers to participate in the scheme; lowering the essential requirements for tendering to encourage more local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups to participate; raising the financial limit of contract value of work assignments to allow larger government contracts to be awarded through the scheme; and introducing a brand-new Category D to promote and expand the wider adoption of diversified secure and reliable technologies in government IT systems. These measures will unleash greater market potential, thereby creating business opportunities for more suppliers to participate in government IT projects,"" a spokesperson for the DPO said.

  Since its initial launch in 2005, the SOA-QPS scheme has always been an important part of the Government's strategy to promote the development of the local IT industry, drive the innovative application of IT, and improve the efficiency and quality of public services. As part of the Government’s IT outsourcing strategy, the scheme has been an effective means of addressing the Government's large demand for IT professional services. It also provides promising business prospects for the local IT industry and helps to bring innovative and creative IT services to government departments. The total value of the contracts awarded in the past four years under the prevailing scheme is over $3.9 billion. It is anticipated that the total contract value of the coming scheme will be even higher.

  The new SOA-QPS scheme covers four categories of IT services:

Category A: pre-implementation services, system development, implementation and post-implementation dedicated management services of IT services;
Category B: information security, data privacy, independent testing, independent quality control and quality assurance as well as dedicated management services;
Category C: deployment and maintenance of IT application systems common to government bureaux and departments; and
Category D: services same as Category A but specifically for IT systems adopting diversified, secure and reliable technologies

  Category A is further divided into Major and Minor Groups. The demarcation is based on the contract value of work assignment, which has been increased from $3 million to $4 million. The main objective of the setting up of Minor Group is to allow more local SMEs to participate in the government projects while the increase on demarcation limit enables SMEs to participate in more government projects.

  The new round of the SOA-QPS scheme also strengthens the regulation and monitoring procedures of contractors' performance by taking into account contractors' performance in contracts awarded under the previous round of the scheme. During the 48-month contract period, government bureaux and departments (B/Ds) may invite contractors in the relevant categories and groups to submit proposals for individual IT projects. Contractors will be selected based on both technical and price assessments. B/Ds will award a service contract to the contractor whose proposal meets the technical requirements and attains the highest combined score according to the marking scheme. Contractors with continuous subpar performance may be suspended by the DPO from further bidding under the scheme until their performance improves.

  The tender notice and the tender documents are available for download at the DPO's website (www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/business_window/tender_eoi_rfp/).

  A briefing session will be held on January 16, 2026 for prospective tenderers. Details are set out in the tender documents."
政府資訊科技專業服務新一輪常備承辦協議招標,2026-01-02 09:30,2026-01-02 09:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010100391.htm,"​​數字政策辦公室（數字辦）今日（一月二日）在政府憲報刊登招標公告，邀請承辦商承投新一輪為期四十八個月的優質資訊科技專業服務常備承辦協議（協議），為政府資訊科技項目提供專業服務。有興趣的投標者須於二○二六年一月三十日（星期五）中午十二時前提交投標書。

數字辦發言人表示：「新一輪協議有多項新措施推動本地資訊科技業界的發展，包括增加可授予的常備合約總數量，讓更多服務供應商能參與協議；降低投標的基本要求，以鼓勵更多本地中小企業和初創企業參與；提高合約價值的金額上限，以容許在協議下批出更大型的政府合約；新增一項服務類別（丁類），以促進和推廣政府部門更廣泛地在資訊科技系統中使用安全可靠多元技術。這些措施將釋放更大市場潛力，為更多供應商參與政府資訊科技項目創造商機。」

自二○○五年首次推出以來，協議一直是政府促進本地資訊科技產業發展、推動資訊科技創新應用、以及提升公共服務效率和質素的重要策略組成部分。作為政府資訊科技項目外判策略其中一環，協議一直有效協助政府應對資訊科技專業服務的龐大需求，亦為本地資訊科技業界帶來莫大商機，並為各政府部門提供創新和具創意的資訊科技服務。現行協議在過去四年批出的合約總值超過三十九億元，預計新一輪協議的合約總值將會更高。

新協議涵蓋四類資訊科技服務：

甲類：資訊科技服務前期推行服務、系統發展、推行及實施後相關專案管理服務；
乙類：資訊保安、資料隱私、獨立測試、獨立品質控制和品質保證及相關的專案管理專業服務；
丙類：推出政府部門共用的資訊科技應用系統及其維修服務；以及
丁類：與甲類相同的服務，但專門針對採用安全可靠多元技術的資訊科技系統。

服務類別「甲」再分為大型和小型項目組別，用以劃分有關組別的項目合約價值亦由三百萬元提高至四百萬元。設立小型項目組別的主要目的是讓更多本地中小企能參與政府項目。提高項目劃界合約價值則有助於中小企參與更多政府項目。

新一輪協議亦加強規管和監察承辦商表現的程序，把承辦商在對上一輪協議所批出合約的表現納入評核範疇。在為期四十八個月的合約期內，各政府決策局和部門（局／部門）可邀請相關類別和組別的承辦商提交個別項目資訊科技建議書，承辦商的遴選將綜合考慮技術水平和報價。局／部門會根據評分制度，向符合技術要求並取得最高總分的承辦商批出服務合約。如有連續表現欠佳的承辦商，數字辦可暫停其參與協議下的投標，直至該承辦商表現有所改善。

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-02 06:45,2026-01-02 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010100762.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月二日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

有關更多健康資訊，可致電衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111），或參閱衞生防護中心網頁和Facebook專頁，以及勞工處於在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，對僱主及僱員發布應採取預防措施的新聞公報。

CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-02 06:45,2026-01-02 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010100763.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 2) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

HKSAR Government strongly condemns BBC for unfounded report on Lai Chee-ying's health condition,2026-01-02 01:01,2026-01-02 01:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010200011.htm,"​The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government yesterday (January 1) strongly condemned the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for the deliberate unfounded report on Lai Chee-ying's health condition in an attempt to fabricate facts to mislead the public by intentionally portraying Lai Chee-ying as a victim, with the aim of covering up his numerous wrongdoings and his conviction by the court.

Court's conviction verdict was entirely free from any political considerations

A spokesperson for the HKSAR Government said, ""The court's reasons for verdict in Lai Chee-ying's case are 855 pages long, which are fully open for public inspection, and include the court's analysis of the relevant legal principles and evidence, as well as the reasons for convicting Lai Chee-ying and the three defendant companies in full detail. The court clearly pointed out in the reasons for verdict that Lai Chee-ying was not on trial for his political views or beliefs. The court's conviction verdict is well-founded and reasoned, fully demonstrating that the court has made its decision on the case strictly in accordance with the law and evidence, free from any interference, and absolutely free of any political considerations.

""The court clearly pointed out that Lai Chee-ying's only intent, whether pre or post Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL), was to seek the downfall of the Communist Party of China, even though the ultimate cost was the sacrifice of the interests of the people of the People's Republic of China and the HKSAR. Also, the court found that Lai Chee-ying was the mastermind of the conspiracies charged in all three counts, and his actions show his deliberate intent to pursue these conspiracies, which constituted a threat and harm to the national security in the PRC and the HKSAR.""

The spokesperson stressed, ""Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law and has always adhered to the principle that laws must be obeyed and lawbreakers be held accountable. Article 5 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security. Any suggestion that certain individuals or organisations should be immune from legal consequences for their illegal acts is no different from advocating a special privilege to break the law, and this totally runs contrary to the spirit of the rule of law.""

Lai Chee-ying's health has been properly cared for

The spokesperson said, ""The claims regarding Lai Chee-ying's health condition as reported by the BBC are false and extremely misleading. The HKSAR Government has pointed out time and again that the Correctional Services Department (CSD) handles the custodial arrangements for Lai Chee-ying in the same way as other persons-in-custody (PICs). The CSD attaches great importance to the safety and health of PICs. Regardless of the identities, ages and nationalities of PICs, the CSD is committed to ensuring that the custodial environment is secure, safe, humane, appropriate and healthy, which includes appropriate and timely medical support.

""The medical services received by Lai Chee-ying in custody are adequate and comprehensive. All correctional institutions have hospitals or sick bays staffed 24 hours a day by Medical Officers seconded from the Department of Health (DH) and correctional staff with professional nursing qualifications. Medical specialists from the Hospital Authority (HA) and the DH will visit correctional institutions on a regular basis to provide PICs with specialist consultation and treatment, including dental treatment. If PICs have dental health issues, the Medical Officer of the institution will refer them to dental specialists. In serious cases, PICs will be transferred immediately to a public hospital for treatment.

""During the public court hearing in August 2025, the senior counsel representing Lai Chee-ying clearly presented to the court that Lai Chee-ying had all along been receiving appropriate treatment and care in prison. The correctional institutions had been arranging daily medical checkups for Lai Chee-ying and that there had been no complaints at all regarding the medical services he was receiving, and the Court also commended the CSD. Moreover, on the day the court handed down its verdict on December 15, 2025, the senior counsel representing Lai Chee-ying stated, when responding to questions from the media, that everyone in the court could see clearly Lai Chee-ying's health condition.

""The CSD provided dental treatment for Lai Chee-ying in 2021 and 2022 based on his needs. Since then, Lai Chee-ying has had no dental health problems nor made any further requests for dental treatment. Separately, in 2025, Lai Chee-ying notified the CSD of problems with his nails, but he has since fully recovered after treatment with ointment prescribed by the Medical Officer of the institution, with no nail loss as alleged in the media reports. In August 2025, before the public hearing, the CSD arranged for Lai Chee-ying to wear a cardiac monitoring device and prescribed heart medication for his claimed heart palpitations, to be used as needed. Since then and up till the present moment, Lai Chee-ying has made no further complaints about his heart palpitations to the CSD. It must be stressed that the allegations made by Lai Chee-ying's daughter and relevant media reports, including those by the BBC, are completely baseless.""

The spokesperson pointed out, ""Certain individuals with ulterior motives, including Lai Chee-ying's family members and certain media, have ignored these facts and continue to spread lies and engage in despicable acts. Recently, Lai Chee-ying's daughter has repeatedly attempted to maliciously smear the HKSAR Government and the CSD, misleading the public to believing that Lai Chee-ying's detention and medical arrangements are poor. Their malicious intentions are obvious. The HKSAR Government strongly opposes and condemns such acts."""
特區政府強烈譴責英國廣播公司就黎智英健康狀況作出不實報道,2026-01-01 22:24,2026-01-01 22:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2026010100786.htm,"​香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（一月一日）強烈譴責英國廣播公司，刻意作出有關黎智英健康狀況的不實報道，企圖捏造事實誤導公眾，刻意為黎智英塑造悲情形象，目的是掩飾其作惡多端並被法庭定罪的事實。

法庭的定罪裁決絕無任何政治考慮

特區政府發言人表示：「法庭就『黎智英案』頒下的裁決理由長達855頁，完全公開供公眾查閱，鉅細無遺地説明法庭對相關法律原則和證據的分析，以及裁定黎智英和三間被告公司有罪的理由。法庭在裁決理由中清楚表明，黎智英並非因其政治觀點或信念受審。法庭的定罪裁決有理有節，充分展現法庭嚴格依照法律和證據作出裁決，不受任何干涉，更絕無任何政治考慮。」

「法庭指出，不論在《香港國安法》實施前或後，黎智英的唯一意圖就是，即使要犧牲中國和香港特區人民的利益，也要謀求中國共產黨倒台。此外，法庭認為黎智英是三項控罪所指的串謀的首腦，他的所作所為顯示他意圖實施該等串謀，對中國和香港特區的國家安全構成威脅和傷害。」

發言人強調：「香港特區是法治社會，一直秉持有法必依、違法必究的原則。《香港國安法》第五條和《維護國家安全條例》第2條明確訂明防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪，應當堅持法治原則。倡議某種背景的人或組織不應就其違法行為和活動受到法律制裁，等同給予其犯法特權，完全違反法治精神。」

黎智英的健康受到適切照顧

發言人表示：「英國廣播公司在報道中所指有關黎智英的健康情況失實並極具誤導性。特區政府已多次指出，懲教署在處理黎智英的羈押安排時，跟其他在囚人士一視同仁。懲教署一直極為重視在囚人士的安全及健康。不論在囚人士的身分、年齡和國籍，署方一直致力為其提供安全、人道、合適和健康的羈管環境，包括提供合適和及時的醫療支援。」

「黎智英在羈押期間所獲得的醫療服務是完備的。所有懲教院所都設有醫院或診療室，由衞生署派駐的醫生和擁有護理資格的懲教人員提供24小時的醫療服務。醫院管理局與衞生署所屬的專科醫生會定期到訪有關院所，為在囚人士提供專科診症和治療服務，當中包括牙科診治。如果在囚人士的牙齒出現健康問題，駐院醫生會轉介他們接受到診牙科醫生的診治。假如情況嚴重，在囚人士會被立刻轉送到公立醫院治理。」

「在二○二五年八月的公開法庭聆訊中，代表黎智英的資深大律師已向法庭清楚表明，黎智英在獄中一直獲得適切的治療和待遇，懲教院所為黎智英每日安排醫療檢查，且對黎智英在懲教院所內獲得的醫療服務沒有任何投訴，法官表示懲教署值得稱讚。而且在二○二五年十二月十五日法庭裁決當日，代表黎智英的資深大律師亦有在回應傳媒提問時清楚表示，眾人都能在法庭上看到黎智英的精神狀況。」

「懲教署於二○二一年及二○二二年曾經因應黎智英的齒科護理需要，為其提供牙齒診治。自此，黎智英的牙齒沒有出現過健康問題，亦沒有就齒科護理方面提出過任何訴求。另外，黎智英於二○二五年曾向懲教署提出有關指甲的問題，經院所醫生處方藥膏後已康復，並未曾出現過如有關報道所指稱指甲脫落情況發生。二○二五年八月，懲教署於公開法庭聆訊前安排黎智英就其所指稱心悸問題佩帶醫療儀器及處方心臟藥物，讓其在有需要時使用。直至目前，黎智英沒有再就心悸問題向懲教署作出任何訴求。因此，黎智英女兒所作的指控及包括英國廣播公司在內的有關媒體的報道完全是毫無事實根據。」

發言人指出：「別有用心的人士，包括黎智英的家人，和有關媒體對這些事實視而不見，繼續重複謊言和作出卑劣操作，其女兒近日更不斷企圖惡意抹黑香港特區政府和懲教署，令公眾誤信黎智英的羈押和醫療服務安排惡劣，卑劣用心昭然若揭。特區政府對此堅決反對，並予以強烈譴責。」"

Hospital Authority successfully implements public healthcare fees and charges reform as public hospitals experience smooth operations on first day,2026-01-01 20:05,2026-01-01 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2026010100712.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The Hospital Authority (HA) has successfully implemented measures under the public healthcare fees and charges reform (fees and charges reform), with all public hospitals operating smoothly today (January 1). The HA has deployed additional manpower across various departments at hospitals to assist patients in need and will continue to monitor operations closely over the coming days to ensure smooth service delivery after the New Year holiday.

The HA Chairman, Mr Henry Fan, said, ""The successful implementation of the reform marks a significant milestone in our public healthcare system. The reform will enhance protection for poor, acute, serious and critical patients, enabling sustainable development of public healthcare services to meet the challenges posed by Hong Kong's aging population. We especially thank all staff for their co-operation in implementing the reform and patients for their understanding of the new arrangements.""

As of 2pm, 1982 patients attended the Accident and Emergency departments (A&E) of 18 public hospitals, including 42 critical cases and 82 emergency cases. According to the new fees and charges arrangement, these two categories of patients will have their emergency room charges, previously set at $180, fully exempted. The other cases subject to the new fees and charges arrangement include 854 urgent cases, 968 semi-urgent cases, and 36 non-urgent cases. The average waiting times for semi-urgent and non-urgent cases was 83 minutes.

The regularisation of refund arrangement in A&E has been implemented to provide patients in stable conditions and with mild symptoms with flexibility in choosing alternative medical care. Patient who chooses to leave A&E before doctor consultation can raise a refund request for the A&E charges within 24 hours after registration to claim a refund of $350. Given the need to prioritise treatment for more critical patients, the HA urges patients with mild symptoms to seek treatment at Family Medicine Clinics (FMCs), private doctors or 24-hour outpatient services at private hospitals to reduce pressure on A&E of public hospitals.

Furthermore, there are 15 FMCs providing public holiday family medicine outpatient services today, offering a total of 1431 consultation quotas. As of 2pm, 487 patients attended these 15 FMCs, of which 4 patients were eligible for medical fee waivers. Overall service usage remains approximately similar to before the implementation of the measures.

The HA Chief Executive, Dr Libby Lee, said, ""After the New Year holiday, many clinical departments in public hospitals will resume normal services. We have deployed additional manpower, including service ambassadors, dedicated teams, and volunteers to station at outpatient clinics, shroffs and pharmacies for answering patient inquiries, and assisting with payments, appointments, and applications for medical fee waivers. Hospitals and specialist outpatient clinics have also set up information counters where dedicated staff provide on-site responses to public inquiries.""

The HA reminds patients that the fees and charges reform has been implemented. Patients are advised to familiarise themselves with the new fees and charges arrangements before visiting public hospitals or outpatient clinics. Some medical service procedures have also been modified. Every cluster has set up hotlines (see table below) for patients to inquire about the fees and charges reform arrangements (see Annex). Patients can also visit the HA website to learn about the new arrangements.

醫院管理局成功推行公營醫療收費改革 公立醫院首日運作暢順,2026-01-01 20:05,2026-01-01 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2026010100711.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）今日（一月一日）順利推行公營醫療收費改革（收費改革）的各項措施，各公立醫院首日運作暢順。醫管局已加強人手，在醫院不同部門協助有需要的病人，未來幾日會繼續密切監察運作情況，確保元旦假期結束後，各公立醫院的服務繼續維持暢順。

醫管局主席范鴻齡說︰「醫管局成功推行收費改革，是公營醫療系統的重要里程碑。收費改革可以加強對貧、急、重、危病人的保障，公營醫療服務得以持續發展，應對香港人口老化對醫療系統帶來的種種挑戰。我們特別感謝所有員工配合收費改革的工作，亦感謝病人理解各種新安排。」

截至下午二時，醫管局轄下18間公立醫院的急症室共接收了1982名病人，當中危殆個案42宗、危急個案82宗。在新收費安排下，這兩類病人會由過往收費180元，變為全數獲得豁免急症室收費。適用於新收費的其他個案分別為緊急的個案854宗、次緊急個案968宗，以及非緊急個案36宗，次緊急及非緊急病人的平均輪候時間約為83分鐘。

為便利病情穩定及較輕微的病人彈性選擇其他就診安排，急症室已將退款安排恆常化。病人如在接受醫生診症前選擇離開急症室，可於急症室登記後24小時內申請退回350元。由於急症室需要優先搶救情況較緊急的危殆及危急病人，醫管局呼籲病情較輕的病人可以向家庭醫學診所、私家醫生或私家醫院24小時門診求診，以減輕公立醫院急症室的壓力。

另外，醫管局今日有15間家庭醫學診所提供公眾假期家庭醫學門診服務。各診所運作暢順，全日合共提供1431個診症名額。截至下午二時，15間家庭醫學診所共有487名病人就診，當中4人獲醫療費用減免，整體服務使用情況與措施實行前大致相若。

醫管局行政總裁李夏茵醫生表示︰「在元旦假期結束後，公立醫院不少臨床部門會恢復正常服務，我們已加派人手，包括服務大使、專隊職員及義工等，派駐在門診、繳費處、藥房等地方，專責解答病人查詢、協助處理繳費、預約及申請醫療費用減免等安排。各醫院和專科門診診所亦增設諮詢站，由專責同事即場解答市民查詢。」

醫管局提醒病人，收費改革已正式推行，病人前往公立醫院或門診就診前，應先參考新的收費安排，部分醫療服務的流程亦有轉變。各醫院聯網亦會設立查詢熱線（詳見下表），供病人查詢收費改革的各項安排（附表）。病人亦可瀏覽醫管局網頁，了解收費改革的各項細節。

政務司副司長出席「油蔴地警署光影之旅」開幕典禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2026-01-01 19:15,2026-01-01 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2026010100687.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（一月一日）出席「油蔴地警署光影之旅」開幕典禮的致辭：

林建岳主席（香港旅遊發展局主席）、炳強局長（保安局局長鄧炳強）、Rosanna局長（文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩）、Joe處長（警務處處長周一鳴）、華哥（演員任達華）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！在新的一年，我首先祝大家事事順利、身體健康、生活愉快、家庭幸福！

今日是元旦，一般我們出席公開活動都有稿讀，不過元旦我覺得大家是否應該開心些、輕鬆些，剛才司儀也提到今日有別具特色的表演，而我自覺也算是表演的一部分，所以加插少許驚喜給大家，脫稿講一會。大家放心，脫稿所說的內容跟今活動日的主題是很密切的。

我知道今日在場的朋友有很多支持油蔴地警署、警方、警匪片，我想向大家介紹一齣神劇、一齣警匪神劇。這劇在座不是許多人知，因為今早我跟鄧炳強局長在立法會傾談時提過，他說有如此的一齣劇嗎？這證明他以前讀書很乖，不是整天看電視。我估計在座人士，可能有兩個人知道這齣劇，一是林建岳主席，他的年紀跟我差不多，我看過的劇他也可能看過；另一個大家一會兒後便知。這齣劇是叫《CID》。內地來的朋友，可能會問甚麼是CID？那就是我們的便衣警察，全名是Criminal Investigation Department，是刑偵部門。這齣電視劇在一九七六年上演，當時我正讀中五，該劇有譚家明導演、許鞍華導演、劉芳剛導演，這些導演很厲害，拍電視劇用菲林拍，拍出來如電影般。戲裏的主角是黃元申，演雜差沙展的是何璧堅，飾演的角色叫陳展鵬。另外戲裏有些好打得的演員如張雷，還有一個是今日在座的華哥。華哥當年才21歲，稍後有司儀與華哥對談環節，我印象中這齣戲是以九龍的差館做背景，有否曾在油蔴地拍攝呢？要問問華哥才知。

這齣戲影響力很大，起碼影響了我。因為當時就讀中五的我看完這齣戲，非常嚮往做CID鋤強扶弱，於是興起要當差的念頭。那年是一九七六年，我一九八一年進入了警察學堂成為警察，一九八一至一九八四年期間當了3年多的督察，時間不是很長，學堂8個月外，出來做過不少崗位如軍裝、雜更、藍帽子、衝鋒，也上過CID班。一九八四年開始感受到長江後浪推前浪，後面的一些後浪很厲害，就是一九八七年有一位鄧炳強加入警隊，所以我還是快些離開警隊。香港警匪片是影視文化的一大寶藏，內地來的朋友可多些發掘。

言歸正傳，今日很高興出席這個由文化體育及旅遊局轄下文創產業發展處推展的「油蔴地警署光影之旅」開幕典禮。大家看見，舊油蔴地警署是一個歷史悠久及建築極具特色的戰前警署，在此打造一個以經典香港警匪片為主題的展覽，最適合不過、不作他想。

舊油蔴地警署數十年來都是香港警匪片及電視劇的熱門拍攝場地，因此一直都吸引了很多愛好香港警匪片訪客，本地也好海外也好，在門外「打卡」。有見及此，由我擔任主席的「發展旅遊熱點工作組」決定將舊油蔴地警署作為一個展覽的場地，納入去年五月我們公布的九個旅遊熱點之一，也是我們的重點。這個亦是繼去年推出「九龍城寨光影之旅」電影場景展覽之後，第二個以香港電影為主題的旅遊熱點。我們希望將香港電影文化與旅遊結合，豐富香港文化及旅遊體驗，同時帶動香港地區經濟。

「油蔴地警署光影之旅」的展場雖然暫時佔地不大（日後可能會擴充），但內容豐富，讓訪客以沉浸方式重溫經典香港警匪片精華片段及名場面，以及於一個非常有真實感的七、八十年代雜差房裏漫遊。訪客亦有機會去羈留室，該處是首度開放，訪客能嘗試被羈留的感覺，拍照留念。在此，我感謝香港電影專業人士對這個展覽的大力支持，你們的創意和專業令展覽增添很多魅力，更令訪客盡興而歸。

乘着「油蔴地警署光影之旅」的開幕，我們特別向旅客推介舊油蔴地警署周邊的旅遊景點、商戶及食肆。就此，油尖旺民政事務處連同油蔴地街坊會，從今日開始到二月二十二日會在油麻地多個地點舉辦「油麻地美食購物節」，大家憑展覽的紀念票，可以享受商戶及食肆提供的額外優惠。

最後，我祝展覽火速爆紅、客似雲來、門限為穿，香港旅遊愈做愈旺、愈做愈火紅！我亦在此祝旅客在油蔴地警署有個不一樣和歷久難忘的愉快光影體驗。多謝大家。"
"Public healthcare fees and charges reform has officially taken effect, unveiling new chapter in Hospital Authority's sustainable development",2026-01-01 18:30,2026-01-01 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2025123100724.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The Hospital Authority (HA) announced today (January 1) that the public healthcare fees and charges reform is now officially in effect, marking a new chapter in HA's sustainable development. Since January 1 midnight, all HA systems have successfully switched to the new fees and charges mode, with operations at public hospitals running smoothly. The HA will continue to closely monitor hospital operations and deploy additional manpower to provide immediate assistance to those in need, ensuring smooth service delivery.

The reform took effect at midnight, with all public hospital systems, including patient registration, payment, and clinical systems, successfully switching to the new fees and charges mode. The HA Chairman, Mr Henry Fan, and the HA Chief Executive, Dr Libby Lee, visited Kwong Wah Hospital at midnight to observe the implementation of the new charging mode and the transition process. They also communicated with all clusters through video conferencing to ensure implementation and support measures were in place.

The HA Chairman, Mr Henry Fan, said, ""The successful implementation of the reform marks a significant milestone in our public healthcare system. The reform will enhance protection for poor, acute, serious and critical patients, enabling sustainable development of public healthcare services to meet the challenges posed by Hong Kong's aging population. We especially thank all staff for their co-operation in implementing the reform and patients for their understanding of the new arrangements. The HA will continue to implement various measures to enhance patient protection and improve public healthcare services.""

Accident and Emergency departments (A&E), which operate 24 hours a day, are among the first clinical departments to implement the new fees and charges arrangements. The HA has adopted flexible arrangements, allowing a small number of patients who completed registration just after midnight to pay the old fees. The HA Chief Executive, Dr Libby Lee, said, ""After the New Year holiday, many clinical departments in public hospitals will resume normal services. We have deployed additional manpower, including service ambassadors, dedicated teams, and volunteers to station at outpatient clinics, shroffs and pharmacies for answering patient inquiries, assisting with payments, appointments, and applications for medical fee waivers. Hospitals and specialist outpatient clinics have also set up information counters where dedicated staff provide on-site responses to public inquiries.""

The HA will closely monitor operations at all hospitals. Meanwhile, patients are reminded that with the official implementation of the new fees and charges arrangements (Annex), some medical service procedures may be modified. Each hospital cluster has set up hotlines (see table below) for patients to inquire about the reform arrangements. Patients can also visit the HA website for related information.

The HA emphasises that with the comprehensive implementation of the reform measures, an enhanced medical fee waiver mechanism has also been introduced. Over 50 000 patients have already submitted advance applications or filed enquiries, with the majority of applications processed. Eligible patients will gradually receive their medical fee waiver certificates, enabling them to have fee waivers granted at their next follow-up consultation. The HA has established dedicated teams to assist patients with fee waiver applications and will increase manpower to shorten processing times.

During the transition period from January to March, patients requiring immediate or urgent treatment, who cannot afford medical expense at the public sector, but cannot provide complete documentation for financial assessment, will be granted ""conditional waivers"" for full or partial medical fees. Patients need only submit relevant documents within three months to receive official medical fee waiver certificates upon passing the assessment.

Patients currently holding medical fee waiver certificates (full or partial), can continue using them until expiry without reapplication. Patients with partial fee waiver certificates who qualify for full waivers under the enhanced mechanism can obtain full waivers by declaring no significant change in financial status at Medical Social Services Units three months before appointments or within three months after hospitalisation, without requiring reassessment. The validity will be the same as the original certificate's expiry date.

In addition to enhancing the medical fee waiver mechanism, the HA has established a second safety net by introducing an annual cap of $10,000 on medical service charges (excluding self-financed items). This expanded safety net aims to help citizens reduce the heavy financial burden of medical expenses arising from unexpected serious illnesses or chronic conditions. Furthermore, the HA will strengthen the healthcare protection of critically-ill patients. This includes accelerating the introduction of more effective innovative drugs and devices, and relaxing the eligibility criteria of means test for the safety net applications, so that more middle-income patients can receive subsidy for self-financed drugs and devices. Patients currently receiving partial subsidy will also be able to access increased support. During the implementation of fees and charges reform measures, the HA will adhere to the principle that the Government's commitment to public health will remain unchanged. All gains from the reform will be wholly utilised for public healthcare services.

The HA emphasises that it has increased manpower to assist patients in need with fee waiver applications and other enhanced protection measures, ensuring that no citizen will be denied appropriate medical care due to financial difficulties. With all enhanced patient protection measures in place, the number of beneficiaries will increase significantly from the current 300 000 to approximately 1.4 million. Together with about 600 000 Comprehensive Social Security Assistance recipients, Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 75 or above, and holders of Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme Level 0 vouchers who will continue to receive full fee waivers, it is estimated that around 2 million people will benefit in total, substantially strengthening patient protection.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-01 17:30,2026-01-01 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2026010100562.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月一日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————
本港今年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自十二月十日確診一宗於十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-01 17:30,2026-01-01 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2026010100563.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 1), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
-----------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10 of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

公營醫療收費改革正式推行　掀開醫管局持續發展新篇章,2026-01-01 16:45,2026-01-01 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2025123100720.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）今日（一月一日）正式推行公營醫療收費改革（收費改革）的各項措施，標誌着醫管局掀開持續發展的新篇章。踏入一月一日凌晨零時，醫管局的不同系統已順利切換至新收費模式，各公立醫院的運作亦非常暢順。醫管局會繼續密切監察各醫院的運作情況並加派人手，為有需要市民提供即時協助，確保各項服務繼續運作暢順。

收費改革於凌晨零時生效，各公立醫院所有系統，包括病人登記、收‍費及臨床醫療系統等轉換過程順暢。醫管局主席范鴻齡及行政總裁李夏茵醫生在午夜巡視廣華醫院，了解啓動新收費模式和轉換過程的運作情況，並透過視像會議與各聯網聯繋，確保執行工作及各項支援措施準備妥當。

醫管局主席范鴻齡說︰「醫管局推行收費改革，是公營醫療系統的重要里程碑。收費改革可以加強對貧、急、重、危病人的保障，公營醫療服務得以持續發展，應對香港人口老化對醫療系統帶來的種種挑戰。我們特別感謝所有員工配合收費改革的工作，亦感謝病人理解各種新安排，醫管局會繼續推行不同措施，加強對病人的保障及提升公營醫療服務。」

24小時運作的急症室是最先實行新收費安排的公立醫院臨床部門，醫管局已採取彈性安排，容許少部分在零時零分後才完成登記的病人，仍然繳交舊收費，整體過程十分順利。行政總裁李夏茵醫生表示︰「在元旦假期後，公立醫院不少臨床部門會恢復正常服務，我們已加派人手，包括服務大使、專隊職員及義工等，派駐在門診、繳費處、藥房等地方，專責解答病人查詢、協助處理繳費、預約及申請醫療費用減免等安排。各醫院和專科門診診所亦增設諮詢站，由專責同事即場解答市民查詢。」

醫管局會密切監察各醫院的運作情況，同時亦提醒病人，隨着新收費安排（附件）正式推行，部分醫療服務的流程亦有轉變，各醫院聯網已設立查詢熱線（詳見下表），供病人查詢收費改革的各項安排，病人亦可瀏‍覽醫管局網頁查閱相關資訊。

醫管局強調，隨着收費改革各項措施全面推行，醫管局亦會實施優化醫療費用減免機制，至今已有超過50000名病人預先提出申請及查詢，大部分申請者的審批工作已經完成，合資格病人將會陸續收到醫療費用減免證明書，可以在下次覆診時獲得醫療費用減免。醫管局已設立專責隊伍協助病人處理申請醫療費用減免的相關事宜，亦會加強人手縮短處理時間。

在一至三月的過渡期間，醫管局會採取特別安排，有經濟困難的病人，如需即日或緊急接受治療，但又未能提供相關文件完成經濟審查，醫管局會發出「有條件減免」豁免全額或部分醫療費用。病人只需在三個月內補交相關文件，通過審查後便可獲發正式醫療費用減免證明書。

至於現時已持有醫療費用減免證明書（不論全額或部分減免）的病人，可繼續獲得減免，毋須重新申請，直至證明書的有效期完結為止。若病人現時持有部分醫療費用減免證明書，並符合放寬後全額減免的資格，病人可在預約就診前三個月內或住院後的三個月內，前往醫務社會服務部，聲明財務狀況無顯著變化後，便可根據新準則獲得全額減免，毋須再次進行評估，而有效期至原有醫療費用減免證明書到期日。

除了優化醫療費用減免機制，醫管局亦引入第二層安全網，設立醫療服務全年一萬元收費上限（自費藥械除外），將更多有需要的病人納入安全網內，旨在幫助市民減輕一旦不幸患上突發重病或長期病而衍生的沉重醫療費用負擔。此外，醫管局會加強危重病人藥械保障，包括加快引入更多有效創新藥械，放寬安全網申請資格，讓更多中等收入家庭病人可獲安全網資助購買自費藥械，而現時獲部分資助的病人亦可獲得更多資助。醫管局在推動各項新措施時，會堅守政府對公共醫療承擔不變的原則，改革所得將會全數投放公營醫療。

醫管局強調，已加強人手協助有需要的病人申請醫療費用減免或處理其他加強保障病人的措施，確保不會有市民因為經濟困難而未能接受合適醫療服務。隨著所有加強保障病人的措施實施，受惠病人數目會由現時約30萬人，大幅增加至約140萬人，再加上大約60萬名綜援受助人、75歲或以上長者生活津貼受助人及長者院舍照顧服務券計劃級別0院舍券持有人，將會繼續獲全額醫療費用減免，估計日後合共有約200萬人受惠，大幅加強對病人的保障。

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-01 16:24,2026-01-01 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2026010100571.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月一日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-01 16:24,2026-01-01 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2026010100578.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 1) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.
