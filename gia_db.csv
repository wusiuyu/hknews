Remarks by SFST about fintech at media session,2025-11-08 10:53,2025-11-08 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/08/P2025110800262.htm,"Following are the remarks made by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at a media session after attending a radio programme this morning (November 8):

Reporter: Hi, English questions from RTHK. So how is the Government adapting its regulatory framework in response to the evolving cryptocurrency landscape? My second question is, you mentioned that there were significant changes in the fintech ecosystem over the past few years. What specific trends are you seeing that could shape the future of financial technology? Thank you.

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury: In fact, we have been adopting a very consistent approach in terms of how we regulate the digital assets sector, which is based on the principle of similar business, similar risk, and similar regulation. Throughout the various legislations that we have enacted, including the regulation of the digital asset exchanges, the Stablecoins, and also the coming regulation of custodians and digital asset trading, the same principle will apply.

In response to your second question about the changes that we observed, I think, first of all, what we see is that there have been changes in terms of how our institutions here in Hong Kong are approaching fintech. For example, if you look at the adoption of AI among our financial institutions, three years ago, the number was around a quarter of the serving institutions. But now the number almost goes to around three quarters. And apart from the wider adoption of technology, another angle to look at is in terms of the extent to which it has been adopted. Right now, you see more focused and also at the same time more embedded implementation of some of the fintech initiatives.

Like blockchain, there have been a lot of discussions, a lot of adoptions in terms of how some tokenised products can be more widely used, for example tokenised deposits and also tokenised money market funds. In such a way that there could be more opportunities given to companies to maximise their returns on their reserves and also on their capital. So all in all, I would say what you observed is an increase in the proportion of companies adopting fintech, at the same time is the extent to which they apply fintech in various elements of their work."

Speech by FS at Gala Dinner of Italian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and Macao (English only),2025-11-07 21:57,2025-11-07 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700869.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at theGala Dinner of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and Macao today (November 7):

Ambassador Ambrosetti (Ambassador of Italy to China, Mr Massimo Ambrosetti),Consul General Ficarra (Consul General of Italy to Hong Kong and Macao, Mr Carmelo Ficarra), Ambassador Harvey Rouse (Head of the European Union Office to Hong Kong and Macao), Mr Davide De Rosa (President of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and Macao), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Buona sera. Good evening. It is truly a pleasure to join you once again at the Annual Gala Dinner of the Italian Chamber of Commerce. This is a splendid and memorable evening - a celebration of enduring friendship, warm company and great fun, as well as a valuable opportunity for networking and forging deeper co-operation.

This evening reminds me of the many qualities that connect Hong Kong and Italy - not just by fine cuisines, great wines and designer handbags, but also by our shared passion for creativity, craftsmanship and elegance. Whether it is the style and sophistication of Italian design, or the dynamism of Hong Kong's business and cultural scenes, we are both driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence.

Last year at this very dinner, I spoke about Hong Kong's role as the gateway to the Chinese Mainland and the broader Asian region. Tonight, I would like to expand on that, particularly in light of the global geoeconomic landscape and China's development strategy.

Despite shifting tides of geopolitics, Hong Kong continues to be open, welcoming, and firmly committed to free trade and investment. Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, we proudly serve as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", linking businesses, capital, people, ideas and opportunities across borders. 

This strategy has proven to be both right and rewarding. We are seeing renewed confidence and optimism in Hong Kong by global investors and businesses. The remarkable surge in our stock market, and growing international recognition of Hong Kong's strengths and competitiveness, are clear and encouraging indicators of this positive development.

We continue to be ranked as the world's freest economy, and we stand among the top three global financial centres. We came third globally in international competitiveness according to the IMD (International Institute for Management Development). Earlier this year, all three major international credit rating agencies reaffirmed Hong Kong's strong credit ratings. 

These encouraging recognitions motivate us to go further and to chart new frontiers.

Last year, I also shared about Hong Kong's commitment to innovation and technology. We stay on course, striving to build an even more vibrant technology sector to drive our next phase of growth. That will diversify our economic structure and provide more quality career opportunities for our people. Our focus is on AI and data science, biotech, fintech, new energy and new materials - areas that we hold clear competitive advantages.

And the carrier of our vision is the Northern Metropolis. We are accelerating its development through two major approaches. 

First, policy innovation. We are dismantling barriers and embracing bold, flexible development models - such as large-scale land disposals - to fast-track integrated development of land, infrastructure and industries. More flexible, tailor-made incentive packages will be offered to attract top-notch global enterprises.

Second, further deepening cross-boundary collaboration with other cities in the Greater Bay Area. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong co-operation zone is a focal point, with innovative policies. For example, seamless flow of capital, goods, talent, data and even biosamples in this zone, plus a streamlined regulatory process to shorten the time to market of drugs and medical devices developed there. This zone will be very attractive to firms in AI, biotech and pharmaceutical products.

Italian companies and start-ups are most welcome to be part of this exciting journey. Set up your R&D (research and development) centres here. Collaborate with our universities and research institutions. Establish advanced manufacturing facilities. Explore our thriving innovation and technology ecosystem.

Above all, we invite Italian businesses to make use of Hong Kong as your platform to expand into the Chinese Mainland and the broader Asian region. And our vibrant financial sector stands ready to help them in raising the funds needed to support their business expansion.

As China advances its high-level two-way opening up, we are elevating our strategic role as a two-way platform - helping Hong Kong and Mainland businesses go global, while helping foreign businesses to seize the opportunities in China and Asia through our city.

I am delighted to share that later this month, I will lead a high-level business delegation to Milan. The delegation will include representives from the Government and related public organisations, business associations, and about 30 to 40 Hong Kong and Mainland enterprises from sectors such as finance, medical and health, green and sustainability, transport and logistics, as well as professional services.

We will be there to explore partnership opportunities with Italian businesses - to invest in Italy, expand further into Europe, and help bring more Italian businesses into the immense opportunities of China and Asia.

Before I close, allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Italian Chamber of Commerce and the Italian Consulate-General for your steadfast support and partnership over the years. Your efforts have played a vital role in strengthening the ties and friendship between our communities, and fostering more collaboration in business and cultural exchanges.

May your businesses flourish, your connections grow stronger, and may our friendship continue to deepen and thrive.

Grazie. Thank you."

CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another severe paediatric influenza infection case reported,2025-11-07 21:30,2025-11-07 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700856.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 7) recorded a severe paediatric influenza infection case. The CHP reiterated its appeal to urge schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves a 13-year-old boy with good past health. He has developed a fever since October 24, the situation persisted and he further developed cough, sore throat and runny nose since October 29. He attended a private hospital on November 1 and was admitted for treatment. He was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit of Queen Mary Hospitalyesterday (November 6). He is currently in stable condition. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with pneumonia and pleural effusion.

One of his household contacts developed influenza-like illness symptoms recently, and subsequently recovered. Four of his schoolmates in the same form recently developed respiratory symptoms, one of them required hospitalisation and was subsequently discharged after recovery, whose nasopharyngeal swab specimens also tested positive for influenza A virus. The symptoms of the other three patients are mild and hospitalisation was not required. The CHP has advised the school to implement the necessary infection control measures and will continue to put the school under medical surveillance.

Including the abovementioned case, there have been 17 severe paediatric influenza cases since the start of the school year in September, including one fatal case. The affected children aged 11 months to 17 years, with 12 having good past health and 11 had not received SIV for the season.

""Hong Kong is currently in the summer influenza season, with influenza activity steadily rising since early September. It peaked in mid-October and has remained at high levels since then. According to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity began to decline in the last week of October. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for seasonal influenza viruses decreased from approximately 12 per cent in mid-October to 8.73 per cent while the influenza admission rate in public hospitals fell from 0.89 cases per 10 000 population to 0.53 cases. Based on current trends, influenza activity is expected to remain at relatively high levels in the coming weeks. However, as the weather turns cooler, fluctuations cannot be ruled out. We need to observe for another one to two weeks to confirm whether influenza activity has peaked. Based on past experience, Hong Kong's winter influenza season typically occurs between January and March. Therefore, a resurgence early next year cannot be ruled out. I urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV, to act promptly, particularly those high-risk groups such as the elderly, children, and adults with underlying illnesses and immunosuppression. Members of the public may also contact their family doctors to arrange for vaccinations,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

Dr Tsui reminded high-risk individuals to wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

""Members of the public, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if presented with fever and respiratory symptoms, for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an AED immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions,"" Dr Tsui said.

In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."
再錄得一宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-11-07 21:06,2025-11-07 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700819.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月七日）接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案，再次敦促學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的13歲男童。他在十月二十四日開始出現發燒，情況一直持續，至十月二十九日出現咳嗽、喉嚨痛和流鼻水，於十一月一日到私家醫院求醫，需留院治理。他於昨日（十一月六日）被送到瑪麗醫院兒童深切治療部留醫，目前穩定。他的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發肺炎及胸腔積液。

他的一名家居接觸者近日曾出現流感樣病徵，現已康復。他的四名同級同學近日出現呼吸道病徵，其中一人需留院治理，但已康復出院，其鼻咽拭子樣本同樣證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應。其餘三人病況輕微，無需入院。中心已建議校方實施感染控制措施，並會對該校進行醫學監察。

計及上述個案，由九月開學至今，有17宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，當中包括一宗死亡個案。患者年齡介乎11個月大至17歲，其中12人過往的健康狀況良好，11人未接種當季疫苗。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港正值夏季流感季節，流感活躍程度自九月初起持續攀升，上月（十月）中達到高位，並維持在高水平。最新的監測數據顯示，活躍程度在十月最後一周開始回落，呼吸道樣本陽性百分比由十月中約12%降至8.73%，公立醫院流感入院率亦由每萬人口0.89宗降至0.53宗。按目前趨勢分析，未來幾星期流感活躍程度預計仍維持較高水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除會有反覆。我們需再觀察一至兩個星期，以確認是否已過高峰。根據過往經驗，香港冬季流感季節大多於一至三月出現，因此不排除明年初再度上升。我呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動，特別是高風險群組，例如長者、兒童，及患有慢性疾病和免疫抑制的成年人。市民亦可以聯絡自己家庭醫生安排接種。」

他提醒高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

徐樂堅醫生說：「如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。」

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

Director-General Hu (Director-General of the Department of Administration and Finance of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Hu Zhongyong), Deputy Director-General of the Commissioner's Office of China's Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Mr Zhu Xiufeng, Edward (President of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Mr Edward Au), Past Presidents, fellow members, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a pleasure to join you once again at the Annual Dinner of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

Each year, as I attend this event, I am reminded of the strength, dedication and unity of our accounting community. Seeing so many familiar and new faces tonight, I am heartened by the collective commitment we share to serve our beloved Hong Kong.

The theme of this year's dinner, ""Sustainable Impact, Enduring Value"", could not be more timely. It encapsulates the essence of what the accounting profession must strive for - not just ensuring financial integrity and regulatory compliance, but also making valuable contributions to the success of the organisation they serve, and the long-term development of our economy and our society.

Indeed, we are living in a time of profound transformation and uncertainty. The global political and economic landscape is undergoing deep structural shifts. Technological advancements, particularly artificial intelligence, are reshaping industries, redefining competitiveness and transforming our way of life. Meanwhile, the challenges of climate change are daunting. Amid such sweeping changes, what role does the accounting profession play? Are we facing declining relevance - or untapped opportunity? And above all, what lies ahead for our profession?

Global trends and our opportunities

In my view, Hong Kong is entering a new era, and we must have a clear vision, versatility in skills, and the agility and determination to navigate change. Allow me to share three key observations - along with my perspective on how the accounting profession can adapt and thrive.

Reconfiguration of global economy

First, the reconfiguration of the global economic landscape. Geopolitical tensions have reshaped the global trade order, moving it from multilateralism to regionalisation, characterised by enhanced multilateral or bilateral collaboration within regions. This is evident in the push to expand regional trade frameworks such as RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) and CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership). The FTA (Free Trade Area) 3.0 recently signed between China and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), as well as renewed calls to resume negotiations on a trilateral FTA among China, Korea and Japan, are good examples.

It is noteworthy that despite all the external pressure, China continues to advance steadily. The recent Fourth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee offered a clear roadmap for China's development under the forthcoming 15th Five-Year Plan. It has reaffirmed the country's steadfast commitment to high-level two-way opening up. It has emphasised technological self-reliance, with particular focus on the integration of innovation with industrial development.

Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong will continue to thrive as a two-way platform with our ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" role. Our national policy is to encourage Mainland enterprises to go global. Increasingly, these enterprises are expanding their presence across the globe to reconfigure their own supply chain and industry chain - particularly in regions such as Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and other parts of the Global South. This outward push is not only a strategic use of their domestic production capacity, but also a broader effort to drive international industrial collaboration.

Many Mainland enterprises are choosing to go global through Hong Kong. They are leveraging our city as a strategic platform for raising capital, and providing support services like treasury and supply chain management, transport and logistics, and as an offshore hub for R&D (research and development) and talent. In doing so, they require a comprehensive suite of financial and professional services - from trade finance and tax advisory to ESG (environmental, social, and governance) consulting. This is evidenced by the recent uptake of substantial office space in Hong Kong, with some Mainland companies even securing entire office blocks to establish their regional and international headquarters here.

To capture this opportunity, the Government has established the GoGlobal Task Force (Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global), led by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, to co-ordinate institutional support across the public and private sectors to facilitate their smooth landing in Hong Kong and overseas expansion.

For accounting professionals, this presents a wealth of opportunities. It is noteworthy that our professional expertise, international experience and exposure, language skills, extensive networks, work ethics and integrity are very much treasured by them.

Fellow members, joining them and helping them in their journey of global expansion is a promising and rewarding career choice.

At the same time, many businesses from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Central Asia are looking to Hong Kong as a springboard and gateway into the Mainland. Hong Kong is where they can raise funds, find partners and get professional support to tap into the vast Mainland market. Over the past year or so, companies from Thailand, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Singapore have come to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. We will soon welcome the first Middle Eastern company from the UAE (United Arab Emirates). These developments are opening up a broader career stage for accounting professionals.

Technological advancement

Second, technological disruption, particularly AI. AI is transforming industries and ways of life at an unprecedented scale and pace. And the accounting profession is no exception. We need to embrace it.

The challenge is upskilling ourselves to leverage AI as a powerful tool, while focusing on areas where ethics, human judgement and strategic thinking are irreplaceable. For example, the identification of algorithmic bias, scenario contemplation, disaster recovery, cybersecurity, cross-sectoral collaboration, human resources deployment, and team building - these are domains where professional expertise and human judgement can truly make a difference, and the service is highly valued.

In other words, we need to transform ourselves, enhance our digital and AI preparedness, embrace technology transformation, and sharpen our soft skills. These are becoming the foundational pillars of our professional career and growth.

Green transition

Third, green transition and sustainability. While the US has rolled back on their climate commitments, Asia, and China in particular, remains firmly committed to green transformation and sustainable development.

And I believe the accounting profession will play an increasingly vital role in this transition. From tracking emission footprint to advising on sustainability transition strategy, to green and sustainability reporting, disclosures and assurance - accountants are at the heart of this transformation.

For example, as demand for ESG-related disclosure from investors, regulators and the public continues to grow, the accounting profession's services will become more relevant and recognised. For our part, the Government is also working to enable full adoption of ISSB standards in financial reporting, on a phased basis, by 2028.

A shared responsibility

Fellow accountants, ladies and gentlemen, the road ahead is both demanding and promising. Realising that promise requires the collective effort and wisdom of all stakeholders: from businesses to standard setters like the HKICPA, and from regulators to consultants, auditors and, indeed, every member of the accounting community.

As we gather tonight to celebrate the past accomplishments of the Institute and the profession, let us also look ahead and reaffirm our shared commitment: as steward of public interest, and the pursuit of excellence.

Before I conclude, may I also take this opportunity to encourage all of you to cast your votes in the Legislative Council General Election on December 7. This will help shape the future of our city.

Closing

Thank you once again for the invitation to join you this evening. I extend my heartfelt appreciation to all of you for your dedication to the profession and Hong Kong. Let us put our minds and hearts together to build a more inclusive, sustainable and resilient future for the profession, for Hong Kong and for the country.

I wish you all an enjoyable evening, and continued good health, prosperity and success in the year ahead. Thank you."
Speech by FS at Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants Annual Dinner,2025-11-07 20:47,2025-11-07 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700816.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA) Annual Dinner today (November 7):

Director-General Hu (Director-General of the Department of Administration and Finance of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Hu Zhongyong), Deputy Director-General of the Commissioner's Office of China's Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Mr Zhu Xiufeng, Edward (President of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Mr Edward Au), Past Presidents, fellow members, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a pleasure to join you once again at the Annual Dinner of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

Each year, as I attend this event, I am reminded of the strength, dedication and unity of our accounting community. Seeing so many familiar and new faces tonight, I am heartened by the collective commitment we share to serve our beloved Hong Kong.

The theme of this year's dinner, ""Sustainable Impact, Enduring Value"", could not be more timely. It encapsulates the essence of what the accounting profession must strive for - not just ensuring financial integrity and regulatory compliance, but also making valuable contributions to the success of the organisation they serve, and the long-term development of our economy and our society.

Indeed, we are living in a time of profound transformation and uncertainty. The global political and economic landscape is undergoing deep structural shifts. Technological advancements, particularly artificial intelligence, are reshaping industries, redefining competitiveness and transforming our way of life. Meanwhile, the challenges of climate change are daunting. Amid such sweeping changes, what role does the accounting profession play? Are we facing declining relevance - or untapped opportunity? And above all, what lies ahead for our profession?

Global trends and our opportunities

In my view, Hong Kong is entering a new era, and we must have a clear vision, versatility in skills, and the agility and determination to navigate change. Allow me to share three key observations - along with my perspective on how the accounting profession can adapt and thrive.

Reconfiguration of global economy

First, the reconfiguration of the global economic landscape. Geopolitical tensions have reshaped the global trade order, moving it from multilateralism to regionalisation, characterised by enhanced multilateral or bilateral collaboration within regions. This is evident in the push to expand regional trade frameworks such as RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) and CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership). The FTA (Free Trade Area) 3.0 recently signed between China and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), as well as renewed calls to resume negotiations on a trilateral FTA among China, Korea and Japan, are good examples.

It is noteworthy that despite all the external pressure, China continues to advance steadily. The recent Fourth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee offered a clear roadmap for China's development under the forthcoming 15th Five-Year Plan. It has reaffirmed the country's steadfast commitment to high-level two-way opening up. It has emphasised technological self-reliance, with particular focus on the integration of innovation with industrial development.

Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong will continue to thrive as a two-way platform with our ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" role. Our national policy is to encourage Mainland enterprises to go global. Increasingly, these enterprises are expanding their presence across the globe to reconfigure their own supply chain and industry chain - particularly in regions such as Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and other parts of the Global South. This outward push is not only a strategic use of their domestic production capacity, but also a broader effort to drive international industrial collaboration.

Many Mainland enterprises are choosing to go global through Hong Kong. They are leveraging our city as a strategic platform for raising capital, and providing support services like treasury and supply chain management, transport and logistics, and as an offshore hub for R&D (research and development) and talent. In doing so, they require a comprehensive suite of financial and professional services - from trade finance and tax advisory to ESG (environmental, social, and governance) consulting. This is evidenced by the recent uptake of substantial office space in Hong Kong, with some Mainland companies even securing entire office blocks to establish their regional and international headquarters here.

To capture this opportunity, the Government has established the GoGlobal Task Force (Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global), led by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, to co-ordinate institutional support across the public and private sectors to facilitate their smooth landing in Hong Kong and overseas expansion.

For accounting professionals, this presents a wealth of opportunities. It is noteworthy that our professional expertise, international experience and exposure, language skills, extensive networks, work ethics and integrity are very much treasured by them.

Fellow members, joining them and helping them in their journey of global expansion is a promising and rewarding career choice.

At the same time, many businesses from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Central Asia are looking to Hong Kong as a springboard and gateway into the Mainland. Hong Kong is where they can raise funds, find partners and get professional support to tap into the vast Mainland market. Over the past year or so, companies from Thailand, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Singapore have come to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. We will soon welcome the first Middle Eastern company from the UAE (United Arab Emirates). These developments are opening up a broader career stage for accounting professionals.

Technological advancement

Second, technological disruption, particularly AI. AI is transforming industries and ways of life at an unprecedented scale and pace. And the accounting profession is no exception. We need to embrace it.

The challenge is upskilling ourselves to leverage AI as a powerful tool, while focusing on areas where ethics, human judgement and strategic thinking are irreplaceable. For example, the identification of algorithmic bias, scenario contemplation, disaster recovery, cybersecurity, cross-sectoral collaboration, human resources deployment, and team building - these are domains where professional expertise and human judgement can truly make a difference, and the service is highly valued.

In other words, we need to transform ourselves, enhance our digital and AI preparedness, embrace technology transformation, and sharpen our soft skills. These are becoming the foundational pillars of our professional career and growth.

Green transition

Third, green transition and sustainability. While the US has rolled back on their climate commitments, Asia, and China in particular, remains firmly committed to green transformation and sustainable development.

And I believe the accounting profession will play an increasingly vital role in this transition. From tracking emission footprint to advising on sustainability transition strategy, to green and sustainability reporting, disclosures and assurance - accountants are at the heart of this transformation.

For example, as demand for ESG-related disclosure from investors, regulators and the public continues to grow, the accounting profession's services will become more relevant and recognised. For our part, the Government is also working to enable full adoption of ISSB standards in financial reporting, on a phased basis, by 2028.

A shared responsibility

Fellow accountants, ladies and gentlemen, the road ahead is both demanding and promising. Realising that promise requires the collective effort and wisdom of all stakeholders: from businesses to standard setters like the HKICPA, and from regulators to consultants, auditors and, indeed, every member of the accounting community.

As we gather tonight to celebrate the past accomplishments of the Institute and the profession, let us also look ahead and reaffirm our shared commitment: as steward of public interest, and the pursuit of excellence.

Before I conclude, may I also take this opportunity to encourage all of you to cast your votes in the Legislative Council General Election on December 7. This will help shape the future of our city.

"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, chikungunya fever and dengue fever",2025-11-07 20:14,2025-11-07 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700802.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 7) reported the latest situation of chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF).

Chikungunya fever
---------------------

As of 5pm today, no new cases of chikungunya fever had been recorded.

 Hong Kong has recorded a total of 59 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, three were local cases and the rest were imported cases.

 In light of a locally acquired case recorded in Kwai Tsing District earlier this week,the CHP conducted a risk assessment and collaborated with relevant District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention to over 10 000 households in Mount Haven and the surrounding areas, Kwai Chung Plaza, Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan and the vicinityto remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

 From November 3 to 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 13 000 individuals residing or working in higher-risk districts through three health consultation booths at Cheung Hang Community Hall in Tsing Yi, Kwai Fong Estate (near Kwai Ming House) and the pedestrian bridge towards the east exit of Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan, along with its inquiry hotline, door-to-door visits and questionnaire surveys conducted in the districts concerned. A total of 14 individuals with mild symptoms have been arranged to undergo blood tests and all returned negative results. Details are as follows:





In the vicinity of Mount Haven in Tsing Yi
In the vicinity of Kwai Chung Plaza
In the vicinity of Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan


Number of individuals assessed
Over 4 400 persons
Over 6 100 persons
Over 3 100 persons


Number of individuals with mild symptoms who have been arranged to undergo blood tests
4 persons
6 persons
4 persons


Number of individuals who have completed testing

Given that the vast majority of citizens visiting the health consultation booth at the pedestrian bridge towards the east exit of Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan are people working in the area, and that the number of attending citizens has significantly decreased over the past two days, the booth will cease operations starting tomorrow. The health consultation booths in Tsing Yi and Kwai Fong will continue to provide assessments to members of the public with relevant symptoms. Their operating hours will be adjusted as needed. Please refer to the CHP's webpage for the addresses and operating hours of these health consultation booths. The previously established inquiry hotline (2125 2373) will adjust its operating hours starting tomorrow to 9am to 6pm daily.

Dengue fever
---------------

 From October 31 to yesterday (November 6), the CHP recorded two imported DF cases. The patients had travelled to Cambodia and Zhongshan in Guangdong Province during the incubation periods.

 As of yesterday, 52 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. From January to July 2025, over 4 million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths have been reported in 97 countries/territories.

 DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 40 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 500 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded 3 013 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 306 cases were recorded in a week between October 20 to 26, with the highest number of cases recorded in Chaozhou, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shantou and Foshan.

 Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHP'swebsite.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

 TheFood and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

ãã
 The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

 Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


 The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

 The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
Project Cost Management Forum promotes cost-effectiveness of construction projects (with photos),2025-11-07 19:58,2025-11-07 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700795.htm,"The Development Bureau (DEVB) held the Project Cost Management Forum 2025 today (November 7). With the theme ""Construction New Normal: Co-defining Cost-effectiveness"", the forum explored how to enhance the cost management and cost-effectiveness of construction projects through optimised procurement strategies and the application of innovative technologies.

In his opening remarks, the Deputy Financial Secretary, Mr Michael Wong, said that the Government is pressing ahead with infrastructure investment, which drives economic growth, job creation, talent attraction, and enhances long-term competitiveness. He noted that in the coming few years, the annual capital works expenditure will be about $120 billion, with an additional $30 billion set aside for small and medium-sized projects. Mr Wong also expressed gratitude to the Project Strategy and Governance Office of the DEVB for promoting a culture of ""Fitness-for-Purpose, No Frills"" and helped save about $190 billion across more than 540 projects over the past nine years.

Speaking at the forum, the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, said that the DEVB has been actively fostering a culture of cost-consciousness within the construction industry and has implementedwhole-process project cost governanceat various stages of public works projects to ensure the careful use of public funds. With the rollout of major developments like the Northern Metropolis and an increased capital works investment by the Government, this cost-consciousness mindset is more critical than ever. The Government is planning ahead with an ""ownership"" mindset to comprehensively evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different implementation proposals and review site selection, usage mix, the scale of the project, design, implementation programme etc, in the very upfront stages, to formulate practical and cost-effective proposals. The Government also fully embraces the integration of technological and industrial innovation to enhance productivity, and is keen to uplift the capabilities of a diverse construction talent pool, promote knowledge exchange and strengthen collaboration with Mainland and international partners, thereby reinforcing our role as international infrastructure centre.

Afterwards, the Permanent Secretary for Development (Works), Mr Ricky Lau, delivered a keynote speech. He said that to reduce construction costs for public works and expedite project delivery, the DEVB is advancing reforms in four areas: optimising the project procurement model, applying advanced technologies, streamlining the approval process, and reviewing the design standards and requirements. These cost-control measures are being rolled out progressively to ensure that policies are targeted, practicable and capable of delivering sustained results.


At the forum, Mr Wong and Ms Linn witnessed the exchange of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the DEVB of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the Ministry of Finance of Singapore. The MOU aims to enhance exchanges of professional knowledge and experience in managing and delivering infrastructure projects. It facilitates collaboration between the two places, improves project delivery models through the promotion of digitalisation and the adoption of innovative construction methods. It also strengthens the leadership and delivery capabilities of project leaders, thereby boosting productivity and performance in the construction industries of both places.

The forum brought together expert speakers from different places to share practical experiences in reform and innovation. Among them, the Executive Director of the Centre for Public Project Management under the Ministry of Finance of Singapore, Mr Low Chian Siong, elaborated on institutionalising cost control and implementing outcome-based procurement; the Head of Planning and Cost Control at Public Works Authority ""Ashghal"" of the State of Qatar, Mr Mohammed Bader Alnama, introduced centralised procurement and digital monitoring mechanisms adopted for large-scale infrastructure projects; and the Secretary-General of the GuangDong Engineering Cost Association, Mr Xu Xiyan, shared how cost management can be better aligned with regional policies. Over 400 representatives from government departments, engineering consultancies, contractors and professional bodies from Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland, Singapore, Qatar, the United Kingdom and more participated in the forum both online and offline."

At the meeting, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and the Shenzhen Municipal Financial Regulatory Bureau signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in relation to co-operation in gold-related aspects.

  The Committee discussed the latest developments in the financial markets and financial co-operation initiatives of Shenzhen and Hong Kong. It also explored new suggestions for boosting the further development of a collaborative market.

  The FSTB and the Shenzhen Municipal Financial Regulatory Bureau signed an MOU at the meeting. By leveraging complementary strengths, the two places will jointly build a deeply integrated regional gold ecosystem. The MOU provides lawful and regulatory support for Hong Kong gold traders in co-operating with qualified refining enterprises in Shenzhen to carry out processing trade. The co-operation will bring the initiative to accelerate the building of an international gold trading market as announced in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" into action.

  In addition, the FSTB and the Shenzhen Municipal Financial Regulatory Bureau have reached a consensus on further deepening fintech co-operation and exchange, with a view to fully leveraging the strengths of both cities in fintech and jointly establishing a global fintech centre. The two parties will jointly announce co-operation policies in the fintech sector in the near future.

  Mr Hui said that Hong Kong and Shenzhen, both key engines for driving the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), will undoubtedly continue strengthening financial co-operation at this pivotal juncture when the country is concluding its National 14th Five-Year Plan and preparing for the 15th Five-Year Plan with a view to unleashing the immense potential of the GBA, thus jointly making contributions to the country’s development as a financial powerhouse.

  Mr Luo said that Shenzhen will comprehensively and accurately implement the ""one country, two systems"" principle with unwavering commitment, steadfastly uphold the fundamental principle of ""one country"", and effectively leverage the advantages of the ""two systems"", with a view to comprehensively deepen Shenzhen-Hong Kong financial co-operation and fully support Hong Kong in consolidating and enhancing its status as an international financial centre. This will also accelerate Shenzhen's development into an industry-focused financial centre with significant global influence, and propel Shenzhen-Hong Kong financial co-operation to higher levels, broader dimensions, and wider fields, thereby contributing fresh and greater efforts towards building a financial empowered country.

  Established in June 2024, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Financial Co-operation Committee brings together official members from the financial regulatory bodies of the Central Authorities, Shenzhen and Hong Kong, as well as industry leaders in both places as non-official members to provide insights on Shenzhen-Hong Kong financial co-operation and the development of the GBA's financial infrastructure."

本年度盛事吸引了逾45 000與會者，超過120個經濟體，匯聚1 000多位演講嘉賓，超過800家參展商，以及30多個內地及國際貿易代表團出席，創下歷史新高。香港金融科技周 x StartmeupHK創業節2025由財經事務及庫務局、商務及經濟發展局和投資推廣署聯合主辦，並由香港金融管理局（金管局）、證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）、保險業監管局（保監局）和活動指定承辦商Finoverse合辦。

共慶十載同行

行政長官李家超為香港金融科技周 x StartmeupHK創業節2025主論壇揭開序幕。今年兩大旗艦盛事攜手舉行並設有11個主題論壇，包括金融與科技政策論壇、前瞻論壇、保險科技論壇、健康科技論壇、財富與投資管理論壇、數字金融論壇、數字資產論壇、區塊鏈與Web3論壇、人工智能與前沿科技論壇、全球創科‧智匯中國論壇以及TechX論壇。

中國人民銀行副行長陸磊於主論壇指出，內地與香港在金融科技領域的合作日益緊密。兩地的務實協作已推動多項重要進展，包括內地與香港快速支付系統實現互聯互通、以及數字人民幣的應用案例等，有效提升了兩地金融發展的效率。他強調，正值國家規劃「十五五」之際，香港作為國際金融中心，應藉由推動跨境支付創新，進一步深化互聯互通，從而實現兩地經濟的融合發展。

陸磊續稱，人民幣跨境支付系統在香港持續擴展其業務規模，推出港元清算服務，支持「債券通」南向通、北向通的資金結算。
 
財政司司長陳茂波發表主題演講，並參與由投資推廣署署長劉凱旋主持的專題討論。討論嘉賓包括滙豐集團行政總裁艾橋智，以及渣打集團行政總裁溫拓思。香港現有約1 200家金融科技公司，陳茂波分享了在建設蓬勃金融科技生態系統過程中的三大觀察：以普惠金融為目標、監管機構作為創新的促進者，以及推動負責任、可持續的創新發展。

在題為「策動金融科技新時代」的專題討論中，財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇指出，區塊鏈與人工智能在推動香港金融服務業轉型方面發揮着關鍵作用。他又表示，金融科技監管沙盒及各類資助計劃在香港創科生態系統中同樣擔當重要角色，不僅是推動創新的重要動力，也有助於吸納巿場的寶貴意見與反饋，更好檢視和完善現有政策及監管框架。

亞洲基礎設施投資銀行（亞投行）行長兼董事會主席金立群出席了主論壇，並就金融創新如何助力自然及生態保護分享見解。他表示：「如果能將大自然認證為一種資產，就能使其具備可投資性。我們可通過數字化手段擴大其規模，從而實現長期可持續發展。」他更宣布亞投行計劃在港設立辦事處，以滿足其不斷增長的業務需要。

從心領航：政策與生態圈視角

財經事務及庫務局副局長陳浩濂於主論壇與美圖公司前主席、天使投資人蔡文勝展開深度對話。陳浩濂講述香港在數字資產領域的最新發展。陳浩濂表示：「特區政府正推動數字資產以可持續和負責任的方式發展。作為亞洲領先的國際金融中心，二○二五年六月我們發表《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》，重申政府致力將香港打造成數字資產領域中的全球創新中心。」

創新科技及工業局副局長張曼莉在視像致辭時概述了政府在創新科技基礎設施、人才及產業發展方面的策略性投資，為香港打造蓬勃的創新科技生態系統，以及建設新的實體經濟。她指出，政府致力通過一系列支持措施，更好地協調上中下游的發展，以鞏固香港在創新科技方面的優勢。她誠意邀請金融科技公司和初創企業利用香港為全球創新樞紐的地位的獨特優勢，在香港設立或擴展業務。

環境及生態局副局長黃淑嫻就香港迄今在環境和可持續發展方面取得的成果發表主題演講，並強調科技創新在減碳策略上發揮關鍵作用。她表示：「要有效應對氣候變化，我們需要在氣候變化的適應和應變方面採取適切的對策，以保護市民的生命和財產，免受極端天氣事件影響；而人工智能及機械人在這方面扮演的角色日益重要。」

黃淑嫻續指，特區政府重視在日常工作上應用創科措施，並舉例指香港天文台自二○二三年年中試行的人工智能天氣預報模式，以提供包括熱帶氣旋路徑預測的天氣預報；系統今年成功預測多個熱帶氣旋，其準確度優於傳統數值天氣預報模式。

重塑未來金融：數碼轉型與信任

金管局總裁余偉文闡述了「金融科技2030」願景，聚焦四大重點領域，包括數據及支付基建、人工智能、業務及科技韌性，以及金融代幣化，統稱「DART」，旨在將香港發展成為一個穩健、有韌性與前瞻性的國際金融科技樞紐，並詳細講述各個領域如何為香港金融科技開啓新篇章。回顧過去十年香港金融科技生態的演變，余偉文指出香港即將邁向「金融科技3.0時代」，將科技融入日常生活，以可信、透明及智能為基礎，塑造具影響力和持久韌性的金融生態。

余偉文同時指出，人工智能已從實驗階段轉型成為推動創新的重要動力。目前香港超過四分之三的銀行已部署或試行人工智能方案。他強調需要與業界深化合作，構建可共享和擴展的人工智能基礎設施，從而惠及整個銀行業。他重申代幣化仍是金管局的發展重點，並強調金管局作為推動者與促進者的角色，致力建立互通及可信的網絡，為蓬勃的代幣化資產市場奠下基礎。最後，他表示面對創新，韌性不僅是抵禦衝擊，更在於保障金融服務安全、靈活應變，為未來發展作好準備。

證監會行政總裁梁鳳儀以證監會當日（十一月三日）發出的兩份通函內容展開爐邊對話，指出容許持牌虛擬資產交易平台與其海外關聯虛擬資產交易平台共享全球掛盤冊，令本地投資者更有效利用全球市場流動性。通函同時擴大虛擬資產交易平台就各類型的數字資產可提供的產品及服務範疇。

就證監會與財經事務及庫務局最近的兩項聯合諮詢，梁鳳儀稱，公眾普遍支持有關虛擬資產交易服務及託管服務提供者的建議監管制度。證監會目前有意將虛擬資產交易服務提供者的發牌範圍擴展至就虛擬資產提供意見及提供虛擬資產管理服務，並正與政府商討。新的託管制度將聚焦持牌機構如何管控私人密鑰風險，證監會預期只會發牌予最穩健可靠的機構以確保生態的安全。

保監局行政總監張雲正強調，過去數年科技發展一日千里，推動業界創新固然重要，監管工作也須與時並進。他指出生成式人工智能和區塊鏈等科技在保險業的發展十分迅速。保監局採取平衡監管與發展的雙軌策略，以促進可持續發展，牽頭一系列措施，推動高端科技應用並加強保險業的營運韌性，包括開放應用程式介面框架、網絡防衛評估框架及人工智能促進計劃。他亦宣布發表聯盟式學習白皮書。

張雲正指出，隨著保險業不斷發展，金融監管機構必須秉持平衡及開明的態度，以推動市場具兼容性和負責任的創新發展。

合作為本：共拓創新前沿新格局

從生物科技、金融科技到人工智能與Web3，前沿科技領域成為各界關注焦點。企業與初創團隊在多個舞台及專題討論中分享其在相關領域取得的成果與突破。

諾貝爾物理學獎得主、多倫多大學榮休教授Geoffrey Hinton於活動中分享人工智慧的未來方向。Hinton教授分享其開創性的「母性AI」理論，強調需確保AI真正關懷人類而非取而代之，並提出降低AI相關風險的策略，以及在技術快速演進中維持與人類價值一致的創新機會，同時探討亞洲在推動AI創新中的關鍵角色。

DST Global聯合創辦人兼管理合夥人John Lindfors與啟明創投創始主管合夥人鄺子平於會上專題論壇展開交流，探討顛覆性技術如何重塑全球增長機遇。兩位嘉賓分享從人工智能、生物科技到數字資產，創新浪潮正加速成熟並轉化為可擴展、可投資的市場，並指出新型投資工具如何為全球投資者開啓更多進入途徑。

富蘭克林鄧普頓總裁兼首席執行官莊麗雅預測，下一波大型企業將在人工智能和加密創新領域中湧現。她強調，儘管人工智能和區塊鏈具有變革性，但最大的挑戰在於企業架構轉型管理，這方面初創企業的適應能力優於傳統業者。莊麗雅指出，目前的人工智能投資收益主要集中在晶片製造商和雲端服務等基礎設施供應商，但未來增長將來自企業學會利用人工智能擴大盈利空間。她還重點提到現實世界中加密貨幣和NFT的應用，例如奢侈品的鑑定與防偽和網絡資源分享，並讚揚香港具前瞻性的區塊鏈規管，為業界樹立了創新的典範。


Solana基金會主席劉元立討論了數位資產財庫（DATs） 和交易所買賣基金（ETFs）作為傳統投資者的互補工具，是銜接加密生態系統的橋樑。但她同時強調，在投機週期中，必須篩選出具備長期投資價值的資產。她並指出，穩定幣等金融技術的演進，反映了金融基礎設施正經歷更廣泛的轉型，去中心化平台在利潤創造和資本流動中發揮關鍵作用。在另一場專題討論中，以太坊基金會聯席執行董事Tomasz Stańczak強調了穩定幣在改善跨境支付和推動機構投資者對代幣化資產的關注具有重要作用。

在主論壇期間，大會安排多場傳媒導覽以突顯香港作為全球金融和創新樞紐的角色。重點活動包括與中國內地科技巨頭舉行的專屬導覽。騰訊在導覽上介紹了其跨境支付服務的願景；微眾銀行則聚焦由公司總部引領的創新科技；而螞蟻數字科技強調香港在全球拓展和尖端金融科技解決方案方面的戰略優勢。杜拜國際金融中心和泰國國家創新辦公室的代表團展示了香港為新興市場所扮演的「超級聯繫人」角色；深圳市金融科技協會和中關村金融科技產業發展聯盟代表團則將香港定位為內地企業走向全球的的理想跳板。

在香港金融科技周 x StartmeupHK創業節2025圓滿落幕之際，劉凱旋表示：「本屆盛會的空前成功，充分展現了香港金融創新及初創生態系統的活力、深度與韌性。我們衷心感謝來自世界各地的合作夥伴、演講嘉賓及與會者，共同促成了歷來規模最大、影響最深遠的一屆盛事。展望未來十年，投資推廣署將持續致力於促進全球企業與香港充滿動力的創科生態圈接軌，協助企業拓展至亞洲以至全球市場，推動創新商業化，開拓更多跨境合作機遇。」

The event brought together government officials, regulators, innovators, and industry leaders from around the world for a series of panels, keynote speeches, and strategic discussions. The joint celebration of two flagship events reaffirms Hong Kong's commitment to advancing the digital economy.

 The entire week attracted a record high of over 45 000 visitors from over 120 economies and featured over 1 000 distinguished speakers, over 800 exhibitors and more than 30 Chinese Mainland and international delegations. The event was organised by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK), in collaboration with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and the Insurance Authority (IA), and the appointed event organiser, Finoverse.

Celebrating a decade of excellence

 As the inaugural convergence of the two flagship events, the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, officiated at the opening of the main conference. The main conference showcased 11 themed forums. These included the Policy Forum, Visionary Forum, InsurTech Forum, HealthTech Forum, Wealth & Investment Management Forum, Digital Finance Forum, Digital Assets Forum, Blockchain & Web3 Forum, AI & Advanced Tech Forum, China-Global Innovation Forum, and TechX Forum.

 Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, Mr Lu Lei, attended the main conference and highlighted the fintech collaboration between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong, which has driven advancements such as interoperable cross-boundary payments and e-CNY use cases, unlocking new efficiencies. He emphasised the importance of payment innovation promoting connectivity and fostering integrated economic development between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong. This comes as China charts its 15th Five-Year Plan and reaffirms Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre.

 Mr Lu noted the continuous expansion of the RMB Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) in Hong Kong, including the launch of Hong Kong dollar clearing services as well as southbound and northbound fund settlement functions under Bond Connect.

 The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, delivered a keynote address and participated in a panel discussion moderated by the Director-General of Investment Promotion of InvestHK, Ms Alpha Lau. Joining Mr Chan on the panel were the Group Chief Executive of HSBC, Mr Georges Elhedery, and the Group Chief Executive of Standard Chartered, Mr Bill Winters. With around 1 200 fintech companies in Hong Kong, Mr Chan shared three key observations from the journey in building a vibrant fintech ecosystem - financial inclusion as an objective, regulators as enablers of innovation, and responsible and sustainable innovation.

 At the panel discussion ""Curating the New FinTech Era"", the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, highlighted blockchain and AI as the transformative technologies for Hong Kong's financial services. Mr Hui also noted the important role that regulatory sandboxes and subsidy programmes play in the city's fintech ecosystem. They are not only the crucial driver in cultivating innovation but also conducive to obtaining valuable views and feedback from the market for better review and enhancement to existing policy and regulatory frameworks.

 The President and Chair of the Board of Directors of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Mr Jin Liqun, attended the Main Conference and shared insights on how financial innovation can help maintain and support nature and ecological conservation. He remarked, ""Once we can verify nature as an asset, we can make it investable. We can digitise and scale it to make it sustainable in the long run."" He also announced the AIIB's plan to set up an office in Hong Kong to address its growing business needs.

Charging ahead with heart: policy and ecosystem perspectives

 The Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, engaged in an in-depth dialogue with ex-Chairman of Meitu and Angel Investor Mr Cai Wensheng at the Main Conference. Mr Chan detailed Hong Kong's latest growth in the digital asset space. Mr Chan stated that ""The Government is promoting the development of digital asset in a sustainable and responsible manner. As Asia's leading international financial centre, in June 2025, we issued the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong, reinforcing its commitment to establishing Hong Kong as a global hub for innovation in the digital asset field.""

 The Under Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Ms Lillian Cheong, in a video speech, outlined the Government's strategic investments in I&T (innovation and technology) infrastructure, talent and industry development, with a view to fostering a vibrant I&T ecosystem in the city and build Hong Kong into a new real economy. She pointed out that the Government strives to consolidate Hong Kong's strengths in I&T through a series of support measures by better co-ordinating the upstream, midstream and downstream development. She extended a sincere invitation to fintech companies and start-ups to leverage Hong Kong's unique advantages that underpins its status as a global innovation hub and set up or expand businesses in the city.

 The Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong, delivered a keynote speech on Hong Kong's environmental and sustainability achievements to date, highlighting the pivotal role played by technological innovation under decarbonisation strategies. ""To combat climate change effectively, we need to adopt appropriate measures on climate adaptation and resilience, to protect life and property of our people from the extreme weather events. AI and robots are playing an increasingly important role in these areas,"" she said.

 Miss Wong added that the Government attaches importance to adopting innovation technologies in its work. She quoted the example of the Hong Kong Observatory, which has been running several AI models to support operational forecasting such as tropical cyclone track forecasting since mid-2023. The AI models have successfully forecast several tropical cyclones this year, to an accuracy better than traditional weather prediction models.

Shaping the future of finance through digital transformation and trust

 The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, outlined the four strategic pillars of the HKMA's ""Fintech 2030"" vision: Data and Payment Infrastructure, AI, Resilience, and Tokenisation, collectively known as ""DART"". He stated that this strategy aims to establish Hong Kong as a robust, resilient, and future-ready fintech hub, detailing how each pillar will drive the next chapter of fintech in the city. Reflecting on the evolution of Hong Kong's fintech landscape over the past decade, he introduced the strategy for the upcoming Fintech 3.0 era, characterised by technology embedded in daily life, underpinned by trust, transparency, and intelligence to create a real-world impact and lasting resilience.

 Mr Yue also noted AI's transition from an experimental phase to a significant innovation driver, with over three-quarters of the city's banks implementing or piloting AI solutions. He emphasised the importance of deeper collaboration across the industry to develop a shared and scalable AI infrastructure that would benefit the banking industry. He reaffirmed that tokenisation remains a key priority and highlighted the role of the HKMA as an enabler and facilitator in building an interoperable and trusted network, which will lay the foundation for a vibrant tokenised asset market. Lastly, Mr Yue stressed that resilience involves not just withstanding shocks, but being secure, adaptive, and future-ready in the face of new innovations.

 The Chief Executive Officer of the SFC, Ms Julia Leung, opened the fireside chatby highlighting two new circulars to be issued that day (November 3). These allow Virtual Asset Trading Platforms (VATPs) to share a global order book with their overseas affiliates, connecting the Hong Kong market with global liquidity. The circulars also expand VATPs' service and product offerings in all types of digital assets.

 Ms Leung also discussed the recent joint consultations by the SFC and Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau on the regulatory framework for virtual asset dealers and custodians, noting positive feedback received. She revealed plans to extend the licensing regime to include virtual asset advisory and management, with discussions underway with the Government. The new custody regime will focus on managing risks linked to private keys. The SFC expects to license only the most robust and reliable players to ensure a secure environment.

 The Chief Executive Officer of the IA, Mr Clement Cheung, emphasised that the key takeaway from the technological advances in the past few years is that ""development is paramount but has to be balanced with regulation"". He acknowledged the rapid progress in technology development within the insurance industry, generative AI and blockchain for example, as ""breathtaking"". Taking a dual approach in balancing regulation and development to foster sustainability, he highlighted a series of milestone initiatives of the IA that promote the adoption of advanced technologies and strengthen operational resilience of the industry, including the Open API Framework, the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework, and the AI Cohort Programme. He also announced the publication of the Whitepaper on Federated Learning.

 Mr Cheung stressed that as the insurance sector evolves, regulators must navigate in a balanced and enlightened manner to promote inclusive and responsible innovation.

Collaboration is key: redefining the innovation frontier

 Frontier technology, from biotech and fintech to AI and Web3, was the centre of celebration as companies and start-ups took to various stages and panels to discuss what they have been able to achieve in the space.

 Nobel Laureate in Physics, Professor Emeritus of the University of Toronto, Mr Geoffrey Hinton, shared at the event the future of AI. Professor Hinton introduced his groundbreaking ""Mother AI"" theory, emphasising the importance of ensuring AI genuinely cares for humanity rather than replacing it. He outlined strategies to mitigate AI-related risks and highlighted opportunities to foster innovation aligned with human values amid rapid technological advancement, while underscoring Asia's key role in driving AI innovation.

 Co-founder and Managing Partner of DST Global Mr John Lindfors and the Founding Managing Partner of Qiming Venture Partners, Mr Duane Kuang, joined the forum session to exchange insights on how disruptive technologies are reshaping global growth opportunities. They shared perspectives on the rapid maturation of innovation - from AI and biotech to digital assets - into scalable, investable markets, and highlighted how new investment vehicles are opening greater access for investors worldwide.

 The President and Chief Executive Officer of Franklin Templeton, Ms Jenny Johnson, predicted that the next wave of major companies will emerge from the AI and crypto innovation. She emphasised that while AI and blockchain are transformative, the biggest challenge is organisational change management, where start-ups adapt faster than incumbents. Ms Johnson noted that current AI investment gains are concentrated among infrastructure providers such as chipmakers and cloud services, but future growth will come as firms learn to expand margins using AI. She also highlighted real-world crypto and NFT (non-fungible token) applications, such as luxury goods authentication and bandwidth sharing, and praised Hong Kong's progressive blockchain regulation as a model for innovation.

 The President of the Solana Foundation, Ms Lily Liu, discussed how digital asset treasury (DATs) and ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are complementary tools for traditional investors, but stressed the need to filter them for long-term quality amid speculative cycles. She highlighted how the evolution of technologies such as stablecoins reflects a broader transformation in financial infrastructure, where decentralised platforms increasingly play a central role in profit generation and capital flow. On another panel, Co-Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation Mr Tomasz StaÅczak, emphasised stablecoins' role in improving cross-border payments and driving institutional interest in tokenised assets.

 During the main conference, a series of curated media tours highlighted Hong Kong's role as a global financial and innovation hub. Key moments included exclusive sessions with Chinese Mainland tech giants. Tencent introduced its vision for cross-boundary payment services; WeBank focused on HQ-driven innovation; and Ant Digital Technologies underscored Hong Kong's strategic advantages for global expansion and cutting-edge fintech solutions. Other tours showcased Hong Kong as a ""super connector"" for emerging markets with delegations led by the Dubai International Financial Centre and the National Innovation Agency of Thailand. Another tour positioned Hong Kong as a launch pad for Chinese Mainland firms to go global, featuring the Shenzhen Financial Techology Association and the Zhongguancun Financial Technology Industry Development Alliance.

 Marking the conclusion of the HKFW x SMUF 2025, Ms Lau, said, ""The unprecedented success of the HKFW x SMUF 2025 speaks volumes about the vibrancy, depth and resilience of our financial innovation and start-up ecosystem. We are grateful to all our partners, speakers and participants from around the world who came together to make this our largest and most impactful edition yet. As we look to the next decade, InvestHK remains steadfast in our commitment to connect global companies with Hong Kong's dynamic ecosystem, empowering them to scale across Asia and beyond, driving innovation, commercialisation, and creating more cross-border collaboration opportunities.""

Customs officers distributed promotional items and explained anti-illicit cigarette messages to residents, as well as introduced the new penalties for offences related to illicit cigarettes, including the penalty increase for offences of failing to declare to Customs officers compoundable under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) from $2,000 to $5,000 and the enhanced maximum penalty for relevant offences relating to duty-not-paid tobacco from a $1 million fine and two-year imprisonment to a $2 million fine and seven-year imprisonment.

Customs officers also explained to the district councillors and residents that a duty stamp system will be implemented to help distinguish between duty-paid and duty-not-paid cigarettes.The first phase of the system is planned to be implemented in the fourth quarter of 2026, followed by full implementation in the second quarter of 2027. Hong Kong Customs launched a three-month pilot run for the duty stamp system on October 6, which aims to evaluate its effectiveness and feasibility, as well as to promote industry and public awareness of the key features of the system that enable them to prepare for related compliance in advance.

Customs will continue to strengthen publicity and education to raise public awareness of anti-illicit cigarettes. If public rental housing units are found to be involved in illicit cigarette crimes, Customs will notify the HD for follow-up action after the conclusion of court proceedings. Customs reminds members of the public, especially young people, not to buy or sell illicit cigarettes or distribute illicit cigarette leaflets to avoid creating a criminal record that could affect their future.

Under the DCO, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

入境處發言人說：「入境處一直致力將免遣返聲請不獲確立者盡快遣送離港，以維持有效的出入境管制和保障公眾利益。由於香港與巴基斯坦未有直航班次，遣送巴基斯坦籍聲請人回國必須透過中轉機場轉機。為加大遣送力度，入境處首次安排特別專機從香港前往廣州白雲國際機場，再轉乘商業航班前往巴基斯坦，執行登機押解遣返行動。入境處成功於單次行動中，強制遣送六名免遣返聲請不獲確立人士回國，並順利將其移交予相關政府機關，顯著提升遣送效率和成本效益。」

根據自二○二二年十二月七日起生效的更新遣送政策，入境處一般可在聲請人的司法覆核個案被高等法院原訟法庭拒絕後，執行相關遣送行動，從而提高遣送聲請不獲確立者的效率及加大遣送力度。

入境處會繼續致力研究不同可行方案以加快遣返免遣返聲請不獲確立者，及與相關單位積極協調以優化遣返路線，並積極與聲請人主要來源國的政府、航空公司及其他政府部門保持密切聯繫，採取一切合適措施將免遣返聲請不獲確立人士盡快遣離香港。"
Immigration Department carries out in-flight escort repatriation operation repatriating six unsubstantiated non-refoulement claimants to their place of origin (with photo),2025-11-07 18:35,2025-11-07 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700697.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) carried out an in-flight escort repatriation operation codenamed ""Expel"" yesterday (November 6), deploying officers to repatriate six unsubstantiated non-refoulement claimants to Pakistan successfully. The persons removed were all male illegal immigrants. Among them were discharged prisoners who had committed criminal offences and had been sentenced to imprisonment. Since the persons had repeatedly refused to accept repatriation arrangements and vigorously resisted in previous repatriation operations, the ImmD resorted to use an in-flight escort to effect the forced repatriation.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""The ImmD has been committed to promptly removing unsubstantiated non-refoulement claimants from Hong Kong to maintain effective immigration control and safeguard the public interest. As there are currently no direct flights between Hong Kong and Pakistan, repatriating Pakistani claimants need to transit through a connecting airport to Pakistan. To enhance removal efforts, the ImmD, for the first time, arranged a special chartered flight from Hong Kong to Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, then interchanged a commercial flight to Pakistan to effect the in-flight escort repatriation operation. The ImmD successfully carried out the forced repatriation to remove six unsubstantiated non-refoulement claimants to their home country in a single operation, and handed them over to the relevant government authorities. This has significantly enhanced the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the repatriation process.""

海關人員去年三月在一次合規視察中，發現該公司於二○二二年二月至七月期間進行的匯款交易有嚴重缺失，包括沒有識別及核實實益擁有人身分、没有記錄收款人資料、没有對相關匯款人進行持續監察業務關係，以及在調查期間向海關人員提供虛假或具誤導性的文件。

海關對判決表示歡迎，認為罰款具相當的阻嚇力，對違法持牌金錢服務經營者作出清晰明確的警示。

海關提醒各持牌金錢服務經營者必須遵守《條例》所訂明的客户盡職審查及備存紀錄的規定。違反規定者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁七年。此外，在進行合規視察時，任何持牌金錢服務經營者如交出虛假或誤導性的記錄、文件或答案以充作符合要求，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

The company was fined a total of $328,000, the highest fine on record among similar cases.

During a compliance inspection in March last year, Customs officers found that the company had serious deficiencies in conducting remittance transactions between February and July 2022, including failing to identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners, failing to record the information of the recipients, failing to conduct ongoing monitoring of the business relationship with relevant remitters, and providing false or misleading documents to Customs officers during the investigation.

Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that the fine imposes a considerable deterrent effect and serves as a clear and definite warning to licensed money service operators who violate the law.

Customs reminds all licensed money service operators to comply with the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under the Ordinance. Any person who contravenes the requirements is liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $1 million and imprisonment for seven years. In addition, any licensed money service operator who produces any false or misleading record, document or answer as if they were in compliance with the requirements during compliance inspections commits an offense and is liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

財政司副司長黃偉綸致開幕辭時表示，政府正積極推動基礎建設投資，以促進經濟增長、創造就業、吸引人才，並提升長遠競爭力。他表示，在未來數年，每年的基本工程開支將為約1,200億港元，另外預留300億港元用於中小型項目。他亦感謝發展局項目策略及管控處在推廣「目的為本、實而不華」文化方面的努力，在過去九年為超過540個項目節省約1,900億港元。

發展局局長甯漢豪在論壇上表示，發展局積極在建造業推動成本管理文化，在工務工程項目各階段實施全流程成本管控，確保公帑得以善用。隨着北部都會區等大型發展項目推展，以及政府加大基本工程開支投放，成本管理意識尤為重要。政府會以「業主」思維作前瞻性規劃，在工程項目初始階段全面評估不同推行方案的成本效益，包括審核項目選址、用途組合、規模、設計與推展時間等，從而制定切實可行及具成本效益的方案。政府亦致力結合科技及行業創新以提升生產力，以及提升多元化建造業人才的能力，促進與內地和海外夥伴的知識交流及合作，以鞏固香港作為國際基建中心的地位。

其後，發展局常任秘書長（工務）劉俊傑發表主題演講。他表示，為降低工務工程項目的建造成本並加快工程進度，發展局正從四方面推動改革：優化項目採購模式、應用先進科技、精簡審批流程及檢視設計標準和要求。相關成本管控措施正逐步落實，確保政策具針對性、可行及成效持續。

在論壇上，黃偉綸和甯漢豪見證香港特別行政區政府發展局與新加坡財政部交換合作諒解備忘錄。備忘錄旨在加強兩地在管理和推展基建項目方面交流專業知識和經驗，促進雙方合作，透過推動數碼化及採用創新的建造方法，改善項目推展模式，並加強項目領導人員的領導才能和項目推展能力，從而提升兩地建造業的生產力及表現。

論壇匯聚來自不同地區的專家講者，分享改革與創新的實踐經驗。當中，新加坡財政部轄下公共工程管理中心執行總監劉建雄闡述如何制度化成本控制和推行成果導向採購；卡塔爾公共工程局（Ashghal）規劃及成本管控主管Mohammed Bader Alnama介紹在推動大型基建項目時採用的集中採購及數碼監察機制；廣東省工程造價協會秘書長許錫雁分享如何推進造價管理與區域政策接軌。超過400名來自香港、中國內地、新加坡、卡塔爾和英國等地的政府部門、工程顧問公司、承建商和專業機構代表，以線上線下方式參與。"

Labour Department launches special enforcement operation to enhance construction safety,2025-11-07 17:34,2025-11-07 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700606.htm,"âThe Labour Department (LD) is highly concerned about the recent spate of fatal and serious work accidents in the construction industry. The LD has stepped up relevant inspection and enforcement measures, including launching a territory-wide special enforcement operation tomorrow (November 8) targeting the construction industry to combat unsafe work activities. This operation will continue for a period of time.

During the operation, occupational safety officers of the LD will inspect construction sites of various types and scales, including new works and repair, maintenance, alteration and addition works, especially high-risk processes such as work-at-height, scaffolding work and demolition works, as well as monitoring the provision and maintenance of safe systems of work for relevant processes by duty holders. If any violations of the legislation are detected, the LD will take stringent enforcement actions, including issuing suspension notices and improvement notices, and initiating prosecutions without prior warning.

For promotion and education, the LD will continue to step up efforts to disseminate occupational safety and health (OSH) messages, including work-at-height, scaffolding work and confined spaces activities, to duty holders through different channels, with the aim of enhancing the safety awareness of the contractors, employers, frontline supervisors and workers, and fostering an OSH culture in the construction industry. The LD is also reviewing the arrangements for mandatory safety training courses and has enhanced the supervision of course providers to ensure the delivery quality of the relevant courses.

In addition, the LD is seriously following up on the recent work accidents and conducting in-depth investigations to identify the causes of the accidents and ascertain the legal liability of relevant duty holders. The LD will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of legislation. Recent accidents showed that OSH should not be neglected regardless of the scale of the works or work processes. Contractors and employers shall properly assess risks, and develop and implement safe methods before commencing work. Employees shall also fulfil their responsibilities by co-operating with employers to thoroughly implement all safety measures.

Under the general duty provisions of OSH legislation, contractors or employers who violate relevant legislation are subject to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years. Employees who contravene the aforesaid provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $150,000 and imprisonment for six months."
CHP announces one new melioidosis case,2025-11-07 17:30,2025-11-07 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700663.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (November 7) announced that one new melioidosis case was recorded in the past week (October 31 to November 6). The CHP appealed to members of the public to maintain personal and environmental hygiene to prevent melioidosis. The CHP also specifically reminded high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water after typhoons or storms with a view to lowering infection risk.

The case involves a 52-year-old male with underlying illnesses living in Sham Shui Po. He presented with a fever and cough with sputum since October 15. Due to persistent symptoms, he attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital on November 3 and was admitted for treatment. He is in stable condition. The clinical diagnosis was pneumonia and sepsis. His clinical sample was confirmed to be positive for Burkholderia pseudomallei upon testing.

  The CHP is investigating the infection source of the case. Initial epidemiological investigations revealed that the case is sporadic. No epidemiological linkages have been established between the case and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of yesterday (November 6), 19 melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded.

Person-to-person transmission and animal-to-human transmission are rare, but the bacteria causing melioidosis can survive in the local environment. Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong, and melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year.

 According to literature, melioidosis cases are more common after typhoons or rainstorms. The bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei in soil and muddy water may become exposed to the ground after typhoons or rainstorms, and the bacteria could spread more easily with strong winds or rainstorms. As such, the number of melioidosis cases may increase.

 With this in mind, where practicable, members of the public should stay indoors during typhoons and rainstorms, avoid travelling to areas with potential flooding, and do not wade in or have contact with muddy water and soil. In addition, high-risk individuals should avoid paths near stormwater drains where aerosols may be generated from contaminated water.

 Members of the public should also take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. using gloves and wearing boots. High-risk individuals may also consider wearing a surgical mask;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover them with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soil or gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.


ââThe CHP appealed to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromising conditions, in order to receive an appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment. For more information on melioidosis, please visit the website of the CHP atwww.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html."
衞生防護中心公布新增一宗類鼻疽個案,2025-11-07 17:30,2025-11-07 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700662.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月七日）表示，過去一星期（十月三十一日至十一月六日）錄得一宗新增類鼻疽個案。中心呼籲市民保持個人及環境衞生以預防類鼻疽，並特別提醒高風險群組，包括長者及長期病患者，在颱風或暴雨後應避免接觸土壤或泥水，減低感染風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的52歲男子。他居於深水埗區，自十月十五日起出現發燒及咳嗽帶痰，因症狀持續於十一月三日到伊利沙伯醫院急症室求診，需留院接受治療，目前情況穩定。病人的臨床診斷為肺炎及敗血症，臨床樣本經化驗證實對類鼻疽伯克氏菌呈陽性反應。

中心正調查個案的感染源頭，初步流行病學調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至昨日（十一月六日），本港今年錄得19宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。

導致類鼻疽的病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可存活於本地環境。類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得類鼻疽個案。

根據文獻，類鼻疽個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令病菌更容易散播，從而令類鼻疽個案有機會增加。

就此，颱風和暴雨期間市民應盡量留在室內，避免前往可能出現水浸的地區，亦不應涉水或接觸泥水和泥土。同時，高風險人士應避免使用雨水渠道附近的道路，以免接觸可能由污水產生的氣溶膠。

市民亦應採取以下措施預防感染：

• 避免接觸受污染的土壤；
• 進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿着適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴，高風險人士可考慮額外佩戴外科口罩；
• 接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
• 盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
• 接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
• 注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
• 外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。就更多有關類鼻疽的資料，市民可參閱中心網站www.chp.gov.hk/tc/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html。"
勞工處展開特別執法行動提升建造業安全,2025-11-07 17:08,2025-11-07 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700567.htm,"勞工處非常關注近日接連發生多宗建造業致命及嚴重工作意外，並已加強相應的巡查執法措施，包括於明日（十一月八日）展開針對建造業的全港性特別執法行動，以打擊不安全的違規作業，相關行動會持續一段時間。

行動期間，勞工處職業安全主任會巡查不同類型及規模的建築地盤（包括新建築工程和裝修及維修工程），亦會特別留意高危工序，例如高處工作、棚架作業和拆卸工程等，並監察持責者有否提供及維持相關工序的安全工作系統。若發現違例情況，勞工處會嚴厲執法，包括發出「暫時停工通知書」及「敦促改善通知書」，以及提出檢控，而不會給予警告。

在宣傳教育方面，勞工處會繼續加大力度，透過不同渠道向持責者宣傳職業安全及健康（職安健）信息，包括高處工作、棚架工作和密閉空間作業等，提高承建商、僱主、前線管理人員及工人的安全意識，推廣建造業職安健文化。勞工處亦正檢視強制性安全訓練課程的安排，並已加強監察課程營辦機構，確保相關課程授課的質素。

此外，勞工處正嚴肅跟進和深入調查近日發生的工作意外，以確定意外成因及查找相關持責者的法律責任。若調查發現違法情況，勞工處會依法處理。而近期發生的意外顯示，無論工程或工序規模大小，職安健皆不容忽視。承建商及僱主須在進行工程前妥善評估風險，制定及落實安全施工方案；僱員亦須履行其責任與僱主攜手合作，做足所有安全措施。

根據職安健法例的一般責任條款規定，承建商或僱主違反相關法例，最高可被判罰款一千萬元及監禁兩年。若僱員違反上述規定，則最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁六個月。"

Stephen (Chairman of the Shanghai Commercial Bank, Mr Stephen Lee), Lincoln (Director of the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Mr Lincoln Yung), Wallace (Chief Executive of the Shanghai Commercial Bank, Mr Wallace Lam), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. It is a great pleasure to join you today to kick off the 75th anniversary celebrations of the Shanghai Commercial Bank (SCB) in Hong Kong.

  Just now, Stephen shared the history and proud tradition of the SCB. I'm pleased to see that throughout your development, you have remained true to the visionary mission back in 1915 - to serve the community, to support industries, and to foster international trade. They remain as relevant today as they were over a century ago.

  Over the years, the Bank has built a strong reputation for serving small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well, in addition, also as the high-net-worth individuals. I believe what sets the SCB apart is the close relationships it has fostered with its clients - one that is built on trust and long-term commitment.

  I'm also pleased to see that the Bank is embracing innovation and playing a pioneering role in advancing financial inclusion. A prime example is your launch of Hong Kong's first SME online platform built on the Interbank Account Data Sharing and Commercial Data Interchange infrastructure - an initiative that streamlines the account opening and loan application process, improving access to credit for SMEs.

  And you are going further. Through active participation in the CargoX project, the SCB is collaborating with public and private partners to integrate credit, logistics and cross-boundary transaction data to facilitate financing and payment solutions for SMEs venturing abroad.

  Looking ahead, I believe the SCB is well positioned for continued growth. Under the roadmap outlined in the 15th Five-Year Plan recommendations by the CPC Central Committee, the country will continue to pursue high-level two-way opening up. More Mainland enterprises will expand their global presence, and many of them will use Hong Kong's top-notch financial and professional services. With strong connectivity across the Shanghai Banks network, the SCB is well placed to support these enterprises to go global.

  At the same time, Hong Kong is fast emerging as the world's largest cross-boundary wealth management centre. The Government is working closely with the industry to strengthen our asset and wealth management ecosystem - by expanding product offerings, enhancing market liquidity and deepening connectivity with global markets. These developments will open up new growth opportunities for your bank, particularly given your strategic focus in this area.

  Ladies and gentlemen, on this special occasion, let me once again extend my heartiest congratulations to the SCB on your 75th anniversary in Hong Kong. I wish the Bank continued success and prosperity in the years to come.

  And before I close, let me take this opportunity to remind everyone: mark your diaries for December 7, the Legislative Council Election. Your vote matters for our city, and for our shared future. Thank you very much."

文化體育及旅遊局局長出席香港藝術發展局呈獻「藝術‧科技」展覽3.0 ----「Ding Lab」開幕禮致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-11-07 16:42,2025-11-07 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700631.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（十一月七日）出席香港藝術發展局（藝發局）呈獻「藝術‧科技」展覽3.0 ——「Ding Lab」開幕禮的致辭全文：

楊偉誠副主席（香港藝術發展局副主席）、各位嘉賓、各位藝術界的朋友、各位師傅：

大家好。

「叮叮」、「叮叮」，搭電車便想起「叮叮」。今日我特意前來這裏，當然是支持藝發局外，屈地街車廠亦是一個很大的原因令我前來，因為我上次來屈地街車廠時，仍在運輸署工作。當時獲電車公司（香港電車有限公司）告知，香港的電車其實是在香港裝嵌，是香港師傅的手工和一個專業。我當時聽見，十分感動，一直記住，以後每次坐「叮叮」的時候，都刻意留意其手工。所以今日回到屈地街車廠，可以與充滿香港本地特色的公共交通工具，一同見證電車已經穿梭香港島120年，陪伴很多人成長。而今日來到這裏，屈地街車廠——是電車的主要生產與維修中心，出席第三屆「藝術‧科技」展覽壓軸項目「Ding Lab」的開幕禮，剛才也說過，意義十分重大。

融合科技藝術創作已經成為新的趨勢，「Ding Lab」讓我們可以登上熟悉的交通工具，探索藝術和科技的軌道如何相交相匯，可以迸發出嶄新的火花。Foreseen Agency的兩位藝術家黃詠珊（飛天豬）和陳家智（Kachi）自去年已經留駐電車廠，經過長期的實地考察，並與車廠不同崗位的員工、師傅深入交流後，匠心糅合先進科技和機械美學，創造出「Tram0」——未來仿生電車，讓觀眾追溯電車的百年軌跡，亦激發我們對城市將來發展的無限想像，別具深意。

非常開心見到藝發局和電車公司跨界合作，讓藝術家有機會走進歷史悠久的車廠尋找創作靈感，打造出實驗精神與文化內涵兼備的藝術作品。我期望日後更多公私營機構可以攜手合作，推動藝術、科技，以及其他產業與香港文化融合，使我們珍貴的本土文化像電車一樣，在時代巨輪下依然堅守自身特色，同時可以注入新意，與時並進。當然藝術以外，大家也知道，立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日舉行，我鼓勵大家當日踴躍投票，選出有能力、有抱負的優秀人才，讓我們一起共創香港未來。

特區政府會繼續支持香港藝術界多元發展，我們會營造這種環境及生態。剛剛在過去星期一（十一月三日）舉行揭幕禮的東九文化中心，是政府首個致力推動藝術與科技融合的世界級表演場地，配備先進的藝術科技設備，以及專業的駐場舞台技術支援。我深信東九文化中心定能夠為香港文藝產業帶來全新機遇，讓觀眾享受非凡的多元體驗。

最後，我祝願「Ding Lab」圓滿成功，為第三屆「藝術‧科技」展覽畫上完美句號。

多謝大家。"

Grading of beach water quality released,2025-11-07 16:33,2025-11-07 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700605.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (November 7) released the latest grading of water quality for 11 gazetted beaches that are open for swimming in November.

  Six beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1), and five as Fair (Grade 2).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Big Wave Bay Beach
Repulse Bay Beach


Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Silver Mine Bay Beach


Golden Beach
Stanley Main Beach




Grade 2 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Middle Bay Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Silverstrand Beach


Lido Beach





  Compared with the grading released last week, Big Wave Bay Beach and Silver Mine Bay Beach have been upgraded from Grade 2 to Grade 1. Deep Water Bay Beach has been changed from Grade 1 to Grade 2.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast)."
Survey on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises' Credit Conditions for third quarter 2025,2025-11-07 16:30,2025-11-07 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700320.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published today (November 7) the results of the Survey on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)' Credit Conditions for the third quarter of 2025. According to the survey, SMEs' credit conditions remained broadly stable.

Regarding SMEs' perception of banks' credit approval stance relative to six months ago, excluding respondents who answered ""no idea/don't know"", 59 per cent perceived a ""similar"" or ""easier"" credit approval stance in the third quarter of 2025, down from 65per cent in the previous quarter (Chart 1in the Annex). 41per cent perceived a ""more difficult"" credit approval stance, compared to 35per cent in the previous quarter. The perception of a more difficult credit approval stance may not necessarily reflect actual difficulties faced by SMEs in obtaining bank credit as the perception could be affected by a number of factors, such as media/news reports, business conditions and opinions of relatives and friends.

Among respondents with existing credit lines, 3 per cent reported a ""tighter"" banks' stance, up from 1 per cent in the previous quarter (Chart 2in the Annex). In this survey, a tighter stance on existing credit lines denotes a range of possible measures or arrangements, such as reducing unused and used credit lines, raising the interest rate, imposing additional collateral requirements, or shortening loan tenor. Therefore, respondents' indication of banks' stance on existing credit lines may not directly reflect banks' supply of credit to SMEs.

The survey also gauged the results of new credit applications from SMEs. 2 per cent of the respondents reported that they had applied for new bank credit during the third quarter of 2025. Among the respondents who had already known their application outcomes, 72per cent reported fully or partially successful applications, up from 67per cent in the previous quarter (Chart 3in the Annex).

Owing to small sample sizes of SMEs with existing credit lines (15per cent of surveyed SMEs) and with new credit applications (2 per cent of surveyed SMEs) during the quarter, the results could be prone to large fluctuations, and hence should be interpreted with care.

About Survey on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises' Credit Conditions

In light of the importance of SMEs to the Hong Kong economy and concerns about potential funding difficulties facing SMEs over the past few years, the HKMA has appointed the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) to carry out this survey, starting from the third quarter of 2016. This survey is conducted on a quarterly basis, covering about 2 500 SMEs from different economic sectors each time. The results of this survey can help monitor the development of SMEs' access to bank credit from a demand-side perspective.

The results of this survey should be interpreted with caution. Similar to other opinion surveys, views collected in this survey may be affected by changes in sentiment due to idiosyncratic events that occurred over the survey period, which can make the results prone to fluctuations. Readers are advised to interpret the results together with other economic and financial information. In addition, views collected are limited to the expected direction of inter-quarter changes (e.g. ""tighter"", ""no change"" or ""easier"") without providing information about the magnitude of these changes.

Detailed tables and technical information of this survey are published on the website of the HKPC (smecc.hkpc.org)."

二○二五年第三季中小企貸款狀況調查,2025-11-07 16:30,2025-11-07 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700322.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（十一月七日）公布二○二五年第三季「中小企貸款狀況調查」結果。調查顯示，中小企信貸狀況大致保持穩定。

關於中小企對銀行貸款批核取態（即難易程度）的觀感，撇除回答「沒意見／不知道」的受訪者，59%認為銀行在二○二五年第三季貸款批核的取態與六個月前相比「沒有分別」或「較容易」，低於前一季的65%（附件圖1）。41%認為銀行的有關取態「較困難」，而上一季度則為35%。貸款較困難的觀感並不一定反映中小企在借貸上遇到實質困難，而是可以受多項因素（如媒體／新聞報道、生意經營狀況及親友的意見等）所影響。

在已獲批貸款的受訪者中，3%表示銀行對其貸款的取態有所「收緊」，較前一季的1%上升（附件圖2）。在本調查中，貸款收緊的含義包括各種可能，例如降低備用信貸額和貸款額、信貸利率上升、增加抵押品要求或縮短貸款年期等。因此，受訪者表示銀行對其貸款的取態並不直接反映銀行實際對中小企的貸款投放。

調查亦收集有關中小企新貸款申請的結果。2%受訪者表示曾於二○二五年第三季向銀行申請新貸款。在已知申請結果的受訪者中，表示申請完全成功或部分成功的受訪者佔72%，高於前一季的67%（附件圖3）。

由於季內有已獲批貸款的中小企及有申請新貸款的中小企數目較少，分別僅佔受訪中小企的15%及2%，調查結果容易出現較大波動，詮釋時需要注意。

關於「中小企貸款狀況調查」

鑑於中小企對香港經濟的重要性，以及過去幾年中小企可能面對融資困難，金管局委託香港生產力促進局由二○一六年第三季起進行是項調查。調查按季進行，每次涵蓋約2 500間不同行業的中小企。調查結果有助從需求角度了解中小企獲得銀行貸款的狀況。

讀者需要小心詮釋調查結果。正如其他意見調查一樣，調查期間可能會出現特殊事件影響到受訪者的觀感，令調查結果變得波動。讀者在詮釋調查結果時應同時參考其他經濟及金融資訊。此外，收集所得意見僅反映受訪者對不同季度之間預期變動的趨勢（例如「收緊」、「沒有改變」或「放寬」），而並非具體變動的幅度。

本調查詳細列表及技術資料，載於香港生產力促進局網站（smecc.hkpc.org）。"

26名分間單位規管租賃業主因違反相關法例規定而被定罪,2025-11-07 16:25,2025-11-07 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700586.htm,"26名分間單位業主因違反《業主與租客（綜合）條例》（第7章）第IVA部（《條例》）的相關規定，於十月三十一日及今日（十一月七日）在東區裁判法院承認有關控罪，並被判處罰款介乎800元至44,000元，合計罰款共102,300元。自《條例》生效以來，差餉物業估價署（估價署）持續加強採取執法行動，至今已合共檢控1 304宗個案，而就法庭已處理的942宗個案，均全數成功定罪，共涉及819名分間單位業主，合計總罰款共2,539,010元，另有362宗個案則正等待進行聆訊。

該26名業主的罪行包括（一）沒有在規管租賃的租期開始後的60日內，向估價署署長提交租賃通知書（表格AR2）；及（二）要求租客支付不屬《條例》所准許的種類的款項（包括要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額）。

估價署於早前發現這些業主涉嫌違反《條例》的相關規定。經深入調查及搜集證據後，估價署向這些業主提出檢控。

估價署發言人重申，分間單位業主必須嚴格遵守《條例》下的相關規定，包括禁止業主刻意打擾租戶成員的安寧或舒適生活等，意圖使租客放棄佔用其分間單位；要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額；同時提醒租客在《條例》下所享有的權益，包括四年（即兩年加兩年）的租住權保障。他亦強調估價署會繼續堅決執法，打擊任何違例個案。估價署除了跟進舉報個案，亦一直以多管齊下的方式主動識別、調查及跟進有關業主涉嫌違反《條例》規定的個案。就此，估價署要求規管租賃的業主提供與租賃有關的資料及參考文件，以核實他們是否已遵從《條例》的規定。如業主無合理辯解而拒絕提供相關資料或忽略署方要求，即屬違法，最高可處第三級罰款（10,000元）及監禁三個月。因應實際情況和所蒐集的資料及證據，估價署會對個別個案採取適當行動，包括就涉嫌觸犯《條例》下罪行的個案提出檢控。此外，估價署已展開新一輪宣傳教育工作，加強宣傳《條例》下主要罪行及刑罰，並強調會主動審查業主有否觸犯《條例》下罪行。

為幫助盡早遏止違法行為，市民應盡快向估價署舉報涉嫌違規個案。舉報渠道包括電話熱線（2150 8303）、電郵（enquiries@rvd.gov.hk）、傳真（2116 4920）、郵寄（九龍長沙灣道303號長沙灣政府合署15樓）或親身到訪（香港灣仔告士打道7號入境事務大樓38樓3816-22室，估價署租務科辦公室，到訪前請先致電2150 8303預約）。此外，估價署亦已於其網頁提供一份表格（表格AR4）（www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/tc/forms/ar4.pdf），便利分間單位租客向估價署作出舉報。

估價署提醒，根據《條例》，規管租賃的規管周期，須由該分間單位的連續兩項規管租賃（即首期租賃及次期租賃）所組成，而每項規管租賃的租期為兩年。分間單位首期租賃的租客有權獲授予有關規管周期中的次期租賃，從而享有總共四年的租住權保障。估價署陸續按照首期租賃屆滿的時間，分批發信給相關規管租賃的業主和租客並夾附有關資訊，旨在協助他們了解次期租賃的重要事項，並提醒應在擬達成的次期租賃開始前約兩個月須遵從的程序，以及在《條例》下的相關義務和權益。有關業主及租客亦可瀏覽估價署網站內的次期租賃專頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html）的相關資料，包括「一圖看清」、小冊子、教學短片及常見問題。有關業主及租客亦應熟悉相關的法定要求，以及就次期租賃保持密切溝通，並按《條例》適切處理有關事宜。

如就規管租賃事宜有疑問，可致電電話熱線（2150 8303）或瀏覽估價署網頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/our_services/part_iva.html）內的相關資訊。"
26 landlords of subdivided units under regulated tenancies convicted of contravening relevant statutory requirements,2025-11-07 16:25,2025-11-07 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700585.htm," Twenty-six landlords of subdivided units (SDUs), who contravened Part IVA of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7) (the Ordinance), pleaded guilty and were fined between $800 and $44,000, amounting to a total of $102,300, on October 31 and today (November 7) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. Since the Ordinance came into force, the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) has continuously strengthened enforcement actions and has prosecuted a total of 1 304 cases to date. Among the 942 cases dealt with by the court, all were successfully convicted, which involved a total of 819 SDU landlords, amounting to a total of $2,539,010 in fines. In addition, 362 cases are pending a hearing.

  The offences of these 26 landlords include (1) failing to submit a Notice of Tenancy (Form AR2) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation within 60 days after the term of the regulated tenancy commenced; and (2) requesting the tenant to pay money other than the types permitted under the Ordinance (including requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance).

  The RVD earlier discovered that the landlords failed to comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance. Upon a comprehensive investigation and evidence collection, the RVD prosecuted the landlords.

  A spokesman for the RVD reiterated that SDU landlords must comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance, including prohibiting landlords from doing any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of members of the tenant's household, with the intention of causing the tenant to give up occupation of the SDU; or requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance, and also reminded tenants of their rights under the Ordinance, including a four-year (i.e. two years plus two years) security of tenure. He also stressed that the RVD will continue to take resolute enforcement action against any contraventions of the Ordinance. Apart from following up on reported cases, the RVD has been adopting a multipronged approach to proactively identify, investigate and follow up on cases concerning landlords who are suspected of contravening the Ordinance. In particular, the RVD has been requiring landlords of regulated tenancies to provide information and reference documents of their tenancies for checking whether they have complied with the requirements of the Ordinance. If a landlord, without reasonable excuse, refuses to provide the relevant information or neglects the RVD's request, the landlord commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine at level 3 ($10,000) and to imprisonment for three months. Depending on the actual circumstances, and having regard to the information and evidence collected, the RVD will take appropriate actions on individual cases, including instigating prosecution against suspected contraventions of the Ordinance. In addition, the RVD has started a new round of publicity and education work to enhance public awareness about the key offences and penalties, emphasising that the RVD proactively checks whether landlords have committed the offences under the Ordinance.

  To help curb illegal acts as soon as possible, members of the public should report to the RVD promptly any suspected cases of contravening the relevant requirements. Reporting can be made through the telephone hotline (2150 8303), by email (enquiries@rvd.gov.hk), by fax (2116 4920), by post (15/F, Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, 303 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon), or in person (visiting the Tenancy Services Section office of the RVD at Room 3816-22, 38/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, and please call 2150 8303 to make an appointment). Furthermore, the RVD has provided a form (Form AR4) (www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/ar4.pdf) on its website to enable SDU tenants' reporting to the RVD.

  The RVD reminds that pursuant to the Ordinance, a regulated cycle of regulated tenancies is to comprise two consecutive regulated tenancies (i.e. the first-term tenancy and second-term tenancy) for an SDU, and the term of each regulated tenancy is two years. A tenant of a first-term tenancy for an SDU is entitled to be granted a second-term tenancy of the regulated cycle, thus enjoying a total of four years of security of tenure. The RVD has been issuing letters enclosing relevant information to the landlords and tenants concerned of regulated tenancies in batches, according to the expiry time of their first-term tenancies, to assist them in understanding the important matters pertaining to the second-term tenancy, and to remind them about the procedures that need to be followed about two months prior to the commencement of the purported second-term tenancy as well as their respective obligations and rights under the Ordinance. These landlords and tenants may also visit the dedicated page for the second-term tenancy on the RVD's website (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html) for the relevant information, including a concise guide, brochures, tutorial videos and frequently asked questions. The landlords and tenants concerned are also advised to familiarise themselves with the relevant statutory requirements and maintain close communication regarding the second-term tenancy for handling the matters properly and in a timely manner according to the Ordinance.

  For enquiries related to regulated tenancies, please call the telephone hotline (2150 8303) or visit the RVD's webpage (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/our_services/part_iva.html) for the relevant information."

尊敬的羅副市長（深圳市人民政府副市長、深圳市委金融委員會辦公室主任羅晃浩）、各位委員：

下午好。歡迎各位出席深港金融合作委員會第三次會議，尤其是深圳的各位代表，特別感謝您們遠道而來到香港出席會議。

今天的會議正值國家「十四五」規劃圓滿收官、「十五五」規劃展開謀篇布局的關鍵時刻，二十屆四中全會也剛召開。在這承前啓後的重要階段，深圳和香港兩個兄弟城市攜手共議，進一步推動粵港澳大灣區的高質量金融發展，更顯得意義重大。

事實上，自去年六月深港金融合作委員會成立一年多以來，兩地官方與業界人士均已積極投入推動深港金融合作的深化，並在多個領域取得了顯著的進展與豐碩的成果。接下來，就讓我簡單介紹幾個與深港金融合作相關的最新動態，拋磚引玉。期待各位在後續的討論環節中提出更多寶貴的見解與建議。

第一，推動內地企業「走出去」。隨着國家推進高水平雙向對外開放戰略，內地企業「出海」迎來重要機遇。香港充分發揮「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台功能，不斷優化上市批核流程，今年已經推出「科企專線」，專門協助內地科技企業來港融資，並支持內地企業在港設立財資中心和區域總部。深圳作為內地創新科技的核心引擎，匯聚大量具國際化潛力的企業，通過香港專業服務的支援，攜手助力內地企業拓展市場，實現國際化發展。

第二，推進互聯互通的深化與擴展。「滬深港通」、「債券通」、「互換通」以及「大灣區跨境理財通」等機制推出以來，蓬勃發展。例如「跨境理財通2.0」去年推出以來，廣受大灣區投資者歡迎，投資者數量和跨境匯劃金額均顯著增長，匯劃金額較「理財通1.0」已增長超過八倍，成效顯著。我們今年也推出了「跨境支付通」，實現了內地與香港快速支付系統的互聯互通，更好滿足兩地尤其是大灣區居民對跨境匯款和支付的需求，惠及民生所需。我們將繼續優化現有的互聯互通機制，與內地金融監管機構合作落實將房地產投資信託基金納入滬深港通和人民幣股票交易櫃台納入港股通等安排，同時積極探索更多創新產品和渠道，豐富投資者選擇，助力國家金融市場開放進一步提升。

第三，在鞏固既有優勢的同時，我們也必須全力開拓和培育新的增長點，主動求變求進，以應對新形勢和新挑戰。其中，國際黃金交易是具有巨大發展潛力的新增長領域。今天我很高興藉着會議契機，我們稍後將與深圳市地方金融管理局簽署合作備忘錄，攜手打造深度融合的區域黃金交易生態圈。此外，金融科技亦是兩地政府重點發展的新增長點，我們正籌劃深化與深圳的金融科技領域合作，包括完善金融基礎建設、構建更活躍的金融科技生態圈、培育兩地金融科技人才，以及加強兩地業界的連繫及合作。這些舉措將充分發揮兩地優勢，共同推動深港兩地在新金融領域的創新與高質量發展，服務國家整體戰略需求。

各位，金融是現代經濟的核心，香港和深圳同為大灣區發展中的中心城市和核心引擎，國家金融強國的建設之路上需要我們共同努力去實現。我們期望與深圳繼續同心並肩、持續創新、協同發展，在不同方面為國家金融強國建設作出貢獻，共同釋放大灣區的巨大發展潛力，在變局中開創新局。

最後，我再次熱烈歡迎大家到來，也期待稍後各位的交流和討論，為深港金融合作提出建議，共同為高質量建設大灣區及深化國家金融市場改革作出貢獻。謝謝各位！"

​一名入境旅客進口未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-11-07 16:00,2025-11-07 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700582.htm,"一名入境旅客因進口未完稅香煙以及未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》，今日（十一月七日）在西九龍裁判法院被判處監禁二個月以及罰款。

海關人員昨日（十一月六日）在香港國際機場截查一名三十七歲的抵港男旅客，並在他的個人行李內檢獲三萬四千二百支未完稅香煙，市值約十五萬三千九百元，應課稅值約十一萬三千元。該名抵港旅客隨即被捕。

Customs officers intercepted a 37-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (November 6) and seized 34 200 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $153,900 and a duty potential of about $113,000, from his personal baggage. He was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

尊敬的崔曉峰董事（中國航空集團董事、前中國民用航空局副局長）、宋一平巡視員（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全公署二級巡視員）、朱秀峰副主任（外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署辦公室副主任）、于曉總裁（香港中國企業協會總裁）、楊俊副處長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室經濟部副處長）、郝雪松副主任（中國民用航空局政工辦副主任）、丘應樺局長（商務及經濟發展局局長）、陳美寶局長（運輸及物流局局長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今天很高興出席由中國國際航空（國航）舉辦的國航C919重飛「兩航起義」北飛航線發布會。

特區政府高度重視在特區傳承和弘揚愛國主義精神，致力構建以愛國愛港為核心、同「一國兩制」方針相適應的主流價值觀。由政務司司長領導的憲法和基本法推廣督導委員會在去年成立了「愛國主義教育工作小組」，負責統籌協調政府部門和非政府機構在香港特區推廣愛國主義精神。

愛國主義教育是關乎人心、細水長流、深耕細作的工作，必須以軟性和打動人心的方式進行，讓市民特別是年輕一代先認識國家，從而認同國家，最終自然地、自發地從內心愛護祖國。因此，我們不時採用合時和「貼地」的素材，生動有機地用於推展愛國主義教育。今次由中國國際航空舉辦的「翼展愛國光輝、載旗榮耀北飛」活動，就是一個優良的例子。

76年前，中國航空公司和中央航空運輸公司的員工排除萬難，把12架飛機從香港啟德機場，駕駛前往北京和天津的機場。這些飛機以及返回內地的兩航人員成為推動新中國民航事業發展的重要力量，為祖國民航史寫下意義深遠的一頁。香港民航處已經在部門總部的航空教育徑增設「兩航起義」及國家民航發展，包括國家自主研製飛機的展覽廳。另外，在香港機場管理局支持下，一個以「兩航起義」為主題的圖片展也於去年在香港國際機場舉行。

國家自主研製出C919飛機，是國家航空製造業的重要里程碑，標誌着國家航空科技取得重大歷史突破。國家民航局自二○一二年開始，已邀請香港民航處參與C919飛機研發的前期工作。民航處其後一直積極參與C919飛機的運行評審。

C919飛機在二○二三年底首次出訪中國內地以外的城市，便來香港演示，飛越維多利亞港上空，當日港人仰望C919飛越維港的雄姿，至今令人難忘。今年元旦，C919開始定期往來內地與香港。香港再次成為內地城市以外，C919首個設有定期航班的地點。國航C919重飛「兩航起義」北飛航線，是對這段歷史的致敬，用上國家自主研製的C919飛機進行重飛，更是添上另一層的特別意義。

作為國際航空樞紐，香港會善用「一國兩制」下連接國家和全球的獨特優勢，助力C919進軍國際市場。就此而言，香港國際機場具備豐富經驗和完善配套，能充分支持國產飛機在境外進行維修。香港國際航空學院也正在計劃加強飛機維修工程師的培訓工作，培育更多人才，便利C919飛機在香港進行維修。特區政府亦在積極發展飛機租賃市場。配合香港完善的法律、健全的金融制度，加上香港是全球最大的離岸人民幣業務中心，香港在飛機租賃具備的優勢，十分有利國產飛機在香港透過融資租賃等方式打進國際市場。

我衷心感謝中國國際航空舉辦這場極具意義的活動，紀念「兩航起義」在中國航空史上驚天動地的一頁，讓先輩們的英勇事蹟與犧牲精神代代相傳。在繼續推動社會各界――尤其是年輕一代――的愛國教育工作中，我們需要像國航這樣具有高度責任感與使命感的堅定夥伴，與我們攜手並肩，以豐富多元、深入人心的形式與活動，將愛國情懷深深植根於社區每個角落。

最後，我祝活動順利舉行、圓滿成功！在座各位身體健康、生活愉快！多謝大家。"

Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Pearl River Delta Regional Air Quality Monitoring Network results for 2024 released,2025-11-07 15:00,2025-11-07 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110600289.htm,"Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao jointly released today (November 7) a report on air quality in 2024 under the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Pearl River Delta Regional Air Quality Monitoring Network, which indicates a long-term downward trend of the concentrations of various air pollutants, namely sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), respirable suspended particulates (RSPs, PM10) and fine suspended particulates (FSPs, PM2.5).

Over the years, the governments of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have introduced a variety of policies and measures tailored to local circumstances, working together to improve regional air quality. The report reveals that the 2024 annual average concentrations for these parameters have declined between 18 per cent and 86 per cent from their peak levels (shown in Annexes 1 and 2). The decline well demonstrates the effectiveness of emission reduction measures implemented across the three places in improving air quality in the Pearl River Delta region.

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has continued to implement various air pollutant emission control measures covered in the Hong Kong Roadmap on Popularisation of Electric Vehicles (EVs), the Clean Air Plan for Hong Kong 2035, Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050 and the Green Transformation Roadmap of Public Buses and Taxis on marine and land transport, power plants and non-road mobile machinery to enhance air quality. In addition, the Air Pollution Control (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 came into effect on April 11, 2025. The Amendment Ordinance tightens five existing Air Quality Objectives (AQOs) and adds three new parameters introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO) to the WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines. Among the 15 updated AQOs, seven are set at the most stringent levels of the Guidelines, which are on par with those of other advanced economies.

For vehicles, the HKSAR Government is committed to phasing out approximately 40 000 Euro IV diesel commercial vehicles progressively by the end of 2027. The Government deploys roadside remote sensing equipment to control exhaust emissions from vehicles. New registrations of fuel-propelled private cars including hybrids will cease in 2035 or earlier, and approximately 700 electric buses and 3 000 electric taxis will be introduced by end-2027. The HKSAR Government has been implementing and promoting green transformation of vehicles and is striving towards zero vehicular emissions by 2050. These efforts have produced early results. As at end-September 2025, the number of EVs in Hong Kong exceeded 135 000, of which about 132 000 were private cars - nine times the number from six years ago, accounting for 21 per cent of all private cars in Hong Kong.

Since 2019, Hong Kong has collaborated with Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) cities to establish a domestic marine emission control area in the Pearl River Delta, requiring all vessels to use compliant fuel within Hong Kong waters while sailing or at berth.

Meanwhile, Guangdong Province published and implemented the ""Notice on Action Plan for Continuous Improvement of Air Quality in Guangdong Province Issued by the People's Government of Guangdong Province"", the ""Notice on Implementation of Monitoring Requirements on Fugitive Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from Factories Issued by Department of Ecology and Environment of Guangdong Province"", the ""Notice on Strengthening Control of VOCs Emissions During Storage and Transportation in Oil Depots and Petrochemical and Chemical Enterprises"", the ""Notice on Further Reduction of Nitrogen Oxides Emission from Stationary and Mobile Sources issued by Department of Ecology and Environment of Guangdong Province"", and the ""Notice on Strengthening Environmental Control on Diesel Trucks of Key Vehicle-using Enterprises"", as well as promulgating the local standard ""Integrated Emission Standard of VOCs for Stationary Pollution Source"". Guangdong Province launched the hierarchical management of VOCs-related enterprises, enhanced the total VOCs management, advanced the control of industrial boilers and furnaces, upheld a co-ordinated approach across vehicle regulations, fuel standards, roadway management, and enterprise compliance to strengthen emissions regulations for diesel trucks operated by key enterprises, conducted compliance checks on new vehicles, improved emissions management for non-road mobile machinery, and carried out regular sampling and inspection of the fuel quality and emissions of engineering machinery.

The Macao Special Administrative Region (Macao SAR) Government is continuously implementing measures to improve air quality in line with the Long-term Decarbonisation Strategy of Macao (including the Macao Electric Vehicle Promotion Plan) and the Macao Environmental Protection Plan (2021–2025). These include controlling vehicle exhaust emissions, phasing out high-pollution vehicles, promoting EVs, and regulating VOCs. In 2024, the Macao SAR Government continued to encourage vehicle owners to phase out high-polluting old motorcycles and diesel vehicles through the Subsidy Scheme for Phasing out Old Motorcycles with Replacement of New Electric Motorcycles and the Subsidy Scheme for Phasing Out Old Diesel Vehicles. These efforts have achieved positive results. Building on this progress, the Macao SAR Government is launching a new phase of the Subsidy Scheme for Replacing Gasoline Motorcycles with New Electric Motorcycles in 2025. This new scheme expands the scope of eligible applicants to include all conventional fuel-propelled motorcycles and extends the scheme duration to five years, further intensifying efforts to phase out high-polluting motorcycles and promote electric motorcycles. In addition, the Macao SAR Government is studying the formulation of a new phase of the subsidy scheme for phasing out old diesel vehicles and is advancing a series of related policies. These include enhancing public charging and battery-swapping facilities, tightening emission limits for motorcycles and diesel vehicles as well as certain parameters for unleaded motor gasoline, restricting the import of construction adhesives exceeding VOC content limits, and increasing the proportion of local photovoltaic power generation. Through these comprehensive efforts, the Macao SAR Government aims to further reduce local emissions, enhance air quality, and achieve the regional joint prevention and control objectives.

The Network comprises a total of 23 air monitoring stations in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao. The Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Centre of Guangdong, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) of Hong Kong, the Macao Environmental Protection Bureau and the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau are responsible for the co-ordination, management and operation of the monitoring stations in the respective places and the release of quarterly and annual monitoring results. The relevant reports are available on the following websites:


The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Regional Air Quality Monitoring Information System (www.gdeem.cn:20047/#/);
The Department of Ecology and Environment of Guangdong Province (gdee.gd.gov.cn);
The EPD of Hong Kong (www.epd.gov.hk); and
The Macao Environmental Protection Bureau (www.dspa.gov.mo) or the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau (www.smg.gov.mo).


Looking ahead, the governments of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao will continue to work hand in hand to build a beautiful bay area and further improve air quality in the GBA."

粵港澳珠江三角洲區域空氣監測網絡二○二四年空氣質素報告發布,2025-11-07 15:00,2025-11-07 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110600287.htm,"粵港澳今日（十一月七日）共同發布粵港澳珠江三角洲區域空氣監測網絡二○二四年空氣質素報告，報告顯示各類空氣污染物，即二氧化硫、二氧化氮、一氧化碳、顆粒物PM10和PM2.5，均呈現持續下降趨勢。

粵港澳三地政府過去多年因地制宜地推出多項政策措施，合作提升區內空氣質素。根據報告，各類空氣污染物在二○二四年錄得的年均濃度值分別從高峰水平下降18%至86%不等（詳見附件一及二），反映近年粵港澳三地推行的減排措施對改善珠江三角洲地區的空氣質量的成效。

香港特別行政區政府（香港特區政府）持續推進《香港電動車普及化路線圖》、《香港清新空氣藍圖2035》、《香港氣候行動藍圖2050》及《公共巴士和的士綠色轉型路線圖》內多項涵蓋海陸交通、發電廠和非道路移動機械的空氣污染物排放管制措施，以提升空氣質素。此外，《2025年空氣污染管制（修訂）條例》於二○二五年四月十一日生效，收緊五個現行空氣質素指標及加入三個世界衞生組織在《世衞組織全球空氣質量指南》中新增的指標。更新後的15項空氣質素指標中有七項訂於《指南》中的最嚴格水平，與其他先進經濟體的相關標準看齊。

車輛方面，香港特區政府致力於二○二七年年底前分階段淘汰約40 000輛歐盟四期柴油商業車輛，並使用路邊遙測設備監管車輛的廢氣排放。香港將在二○三五年或之前停止新登記燃油和混合動力私家車，以及在二○二七年年底前投入約700輛電動巴士和約3 000輛電動的士，積極落實推動車輛綠色轉型，爭取於二○五○年前達致車輛零排放。相關措施已初見成效，截至二○二五年九月底，香港電動車的數量超過135 000輛，當中私家車的數量約為132 000輛，是六年前的九倍，佔全港整體私家車數目約21%。
 
由二○一九年起，香港與粵港澳大灣區內地城市合作設立珠三角水域船舶大氣污染排放控制區，規定所有在香港水域內航行或停泊的船隻，均必須使用合規格燃料。

與此同時，粵方亦透過印發實施《廣東省人民政府關於印發廣東省空氣質量持續改善行動方案的通知》、《廣東省生態環境廳關於實施廠區內揮發性有機物無組織排放監控要求的通告》、《關於加強儲油庫和石化化工企業儲存與裝載過程中揮發性有機化合物排放控制的通知》、《廣東省生態環境廳關於進一步加強固定源和移動源氮氧化物減排工作的通知》和《關於加強重點用車企業柴油貨車環保監管的通知》，以及頒布地方標準《固定污染源揮發性有機物綜合排放標準》，開展涉揮發性有機化合物企業分級管理，加強揮發性有機化合物總量管理，全面推進工業鍋爐和爐窑深度治理，堅持「車、油、路、企」統籌，加強重點用車企業柴油貨車環保監管和新生產車輛達標檢查，完善非道路移動機械排放管理，定期組織開展工程機械油品質量和排放狀況的專項抽檢抽測。

澳門特別行政區政府（澳門特區政府）亦持續按照《澳門長期減碳策略》（包括澳門電動車推廣計劃）、《澳門環境保護規劃（2021─2025）》等政策，按序推出控制車輛尾氣排放、淘汰高污染車輛並推廣電動車，以及管控揮發性有機化合物等改善空氣質素的措施。包括於二○二四年繼續透過《淘汰老舊摩托車並置換新電動摩托車資助計劃》及《淘汰老舊柴油車資助計劃》，鼓勵車主淘汰較高污染的老舊電單車及柴油車，有關計劃取得一定成效。因此，澳門特區政府於二○二五年推出新一期的《淘汰汽油摩托車並置換新電動摩托車資助計劃》，進一步擴展資助對象範圍至所有傳統燃油電單車，並延長資助計劃的年期至五年，加大力度淘汰高污染電單車和推廣電動電單車。除此之外，澳門特區政府亦正研究制訂新一期的淘汰老舊柴油車資助計劃，積極推進一系列政策包括完善公共充換電設施，收緊電單車、柴油汽車的排放限值和車用無鉛汽油的部分參數，限制進口超出揮發性有機化合物含量限值的建築裝修用黏合劑，以及增加本地光伏發電的比例等，以冀進一步控制本地排放和改善空氣質素，落實區域聯防聯控的目標。

區域空氣監測網絡由位於粵港澳三地共23個空氣監測站組成，分別由廣東省生態環境監測中心、香港環境保護署、澳門環境保護局及澳門地球物理氣象局負責三地監測站的協調、管理和運作，以及發布季度及全年監測結果。有關監測報告可於以下網頁查閱：

Welcome remarks by SDEV at Project Cost Management Forum 2025 (English only),2025-11-07 13:06,2025-11-07 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700383.htm,"âFollowing are the welcome remarks by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, at the Project Cost Management Forum 2025 today (November 7):

Deputy Financial Secretary (Mr Michael Wong), our esteemed speakers from Qatar, Singapore, the United Kingdom and our close neighbour, the Guangdong Province and to all the practitioners from the sector, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning! First of all, welcome to you all for joining this Project Cost Management Forum 2025 organised by the Centre of Excellence for Major Project Leaders spearheaded by the Development Bureau. We are privileged today to have renowned experts and practitioners from different parts of the world to share with us their advice on project cost governance and cost management, with their insights on project financing and delivery as well as adoption of innovative technology.

Hong Kong has made remarkable achievements as an international metropolis: we are well-known for our free economy, we are among the most desirable places to do business across the globe, and we ranked at the top among cities for our air cargo throughput etc, the list goes on. World-class infrastructure has been fundamental to this success, driving economic growth and sustaining our long-term competitiveness.

As you may have already known and as highlighted by the Deputy Financial Secretary just now, the 15th National Games will start this Sunday. We are hosting events like fencing, rugby sevens and handball. When it comes to sports, for sure, as the Deputy Financial Secretary has mentioned, the Kai Tak Sports Park would come to mind. Since its opening in March this year, numerous international events, games and concerts have been held, attracting not only locals but tourists around the world. The facility has lifted Hong Kong to greater heights. So it is a great example to testify how world-class facilities and infrastructure could drive our economy.

With a view to providing further impetus to drive Hong Kong's economy, as highlighted in the latest Policy Address and Budget, the Government is committed to accelerating the development of what we called the Northern Metropolis in the northern part of Hong Kong, a new engine for Hong Kong's future growth. This would entail involvement of significant amount of resources by both the public and private sectors to implement an array of infrastructure and development projects, delivering quality premises, as well as facilities for businesses and households.

Notwithstanding the benefits brought about by the investment, we are mindful of the need to use public money prudently. Since the inaugural Project Cost Management Forum held in 2021, we have been actively fostering a culture of cost-consciousness within the construction industry. Over the years, we have implemented holistic project cost management at various stages of public works projects to ensure the careful use of public funds. With the rollout of major development like the Northern Metropolis and an annual capital works expenditure exceeding HK$120 billion in the short to medium term, this cost-consciousness mindset is more critical than ever.

Given the current global financial situation, we must hold on to the principle of prudent use of public funds. Specifically, we are planning ahead with an ""ownership"" mindset - to comprehensively evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different implementation proposals and review site selection, usage mix, the scale of the project, design, implementation programme etc, in the very upfront stages, to formulate practical and cost-effective proposals.

We also fully embrace the full integration between technological and industrial innovation to enhance productivity, and we will adopt transformative solutions in our public works, echoing with our country's 15th Five-Year Plan. For example, the Development Bureau is actively formulating various measures to promote the use of Artificial Intelligence in the construction industry.

We are also keen to continuously uplift capabilities of our diverse construction talent pool, promote knowledge exchange with our Mainland and international partners, and strengthen collaborations with close working partners around the world, thereby reinforcing our role as international infrastructure centre.

As a concrete step to take forward the initiatives I mentioned just now, I am pleased to announce that we would shortly witness the exchange of a Memorandum of Understanding with Singapore. It demonstrates our shared commitment to fostering deeper collaboration in construction innovation and project management.

Lastly, just as robust infrastructure is fundamental to the progress of our society, so too is active civic participation. So you all know what I am going to say next. Please allow me to repeat an important message, an important appeal to you all, to actively participate in one such upcoming exercise to demonstrate civic mindedness, one that also bears significance to Hong Kong's development in the coming four years as we take forward major land development and infrastructure projects, and that is of course the Legislative Council election on December 7. I urge you to not just vote in your various capacities. I think all the practitioners here, you do have various capacities. So just vote in your various capacities and encourage your family, friends and colleagues to do the same. Just as our infrastructure helps shape a better city, your votes help build a better Hong Kong, the place we are proud to call home.

I am confident that today's Forum will be enlightening and inspiring. Let us make the most of this opportunity to collaborate, innovate, and drive progress together.

Thank you."

Pilot Scheme for Direct Cross-boundary Ambulance Transfer in GBA to be extended to Zhuhai and Nansha on Sunday,2025-11-07 12:38,2025-11-07 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700324.htm,"  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government announced that the Pilot Scheme for Direct Cross-boundary Ambulance Transfer in the Greater Bay Area will be extended to designated hospitals in Zhuhai and Nansha from November 9 (Sunday), marking a new phase of the Pilot Scheme.

  In his Policy Address in September this year, the Chief Executive has announced the extension of the cross-boundary ambulance transfer arrangements with the governments of Guangdong and Macao in an orderly manner, including expansion to cover designated hospitals in Zhuhai and Nansha, as well as two-way transfers. To ensure the smooth implementation of relevant arrangements, the HKSAR Government, in collaboration with the People's Government of Zhuhai Municipality and the Nansha District People's Government of Guangzhou Municipality, conducted drills in September and October respectively to assess the simulated transfer of patients under the cross-boundary ambulance arrangements. The drills were conducted smoothly in general. The Pilot Scheme will be extended to Zhuhai People's Hospital and the Nansha Division of the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, starting from November 9.

  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""With the high degree of integration among cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and frequent travelling of residents between different cities in the GBA for living and working, there is an increasing demand for the cross-boundary transfer of patients in a point-to-point mode. The extension of the Pilot Scheme will help enhance the medical collaboration in the GBA, offering patients a safer, more timely and convenient transfer arrangements.

  ""The arrangements for direct cross-boundary ambulance transfer in the GBA involve cross-boundary travelling of vehicles, healthcare personnel, drugs and medical devices, and more. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to various national ministries, including the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, the National Health Commission and the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China, for their support and guidance which contributed to the smooth extension of the arrangements. I would also like to thank various authorities of the People's Government of Guangdong Province, the People's Government of Zhuhai Municipality, the Nansha District People's Government of Guangzhou Municipality and the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality for their concerted efforts in maintaining proactive communication and close collaboration on the arrangements for direct cross-boundary ambulance transfer. In addition, I would like to thank a number of HKSAR Government departments and organisations, including the Security Bureau, the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department, the Immigration Department, the Transport Department, the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority, for their full co-operation.""

  The Pilot Scheme was launched on November 30 last year, with the implementation of direct cross-boundary ambulance transfer of patients from designated sending hospitals in Shenzhen and Macao (i.e. the University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen Hospital and the Conde S. Januario Hospital of Macao) to designated public hospitals in Hong Kong in its first phase. As at early November this year, a total of 17 patients (11 from Shenzhen and six from Macao) had been successfully transferred to designated public hospitals in Hong Kong for treatment. According to professional medical assessments, patients of the above cases have a need for continuous hospitalisation for treatment. Their conditions were relatively stable, but they were unable to cross the boundary on their own and were unsuitable for transfer to an ambulance via the existing boundary control points. The risk during transfers can be significantly reduced if patients are not required to be handed over between ambulances at boundary control points, and the arrangements fully demonstrated the continuous deepening of quality healthcare collaboration and development in the GBA. The overall operation of the Pilot Scheme has been smooth since its implementation, and it will be extended for one year until November 29 next year.

  The governments of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao will continue to review the effectiveness and operational experiences of the existing transfer arrangements, with the medical needs, safety and interests of patients as the prime concerns, as well as to press ahead with the objective of extending the cross-boundary ambulance transfer arrangements to two-way transfers as set out in the Policy Address, aiming for implementation early next year."

他續說：「面對世界環境複雜多變，維護國家安全和維持社會治安的工作仍然任重道遠。但我深信警隊每一位成員，不論正規、文職或輔警，必定會持續秉承警隊前人的專業精神。」他勉勵同袍迎難而上，精益求精，展現「One Force」（一個警隊）的團隊精神，使香港警隊繼續成為世界上其中一支最優秀的執法隊伍。

The Commissioner of Police, Mr Chow Yat-ming, led police representatives to attend and pay solemn tribute to regular and auxiliary officers who made their ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.

Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Chow noted that retired and serving Force members were gathered in memory of the officers who sacrificed their lives in pursuit of the Force's mission. He said that the fallen officers' tenacity in preserving law and order, courage in times of danger and passion in serving the community were commemorated and honoured. Their legacy has been etched in history, underscoring that the job of police is a mission worthy of pride. Their dedication to safeguarding the society and people's lives and property has not only been exemplary for each and every one in the Force but has also left a lasting impression on the public, fortifying the long-established professional image of HKPF.

He mentioned that the spirit of the fallen comrades and all devoted Force members has led generations of colleagues to pass on professionalism and the finest traditions. This has enabled the entire Force to forge ahead and tide over obstacles despite challenges to law and order, major incidents, natural disasters and pandemics, allowing Hong Kong to be back on the right track and ensuring the stability of citizens' lives.

He continued, ""The global environment remains dynamic and complex. Safeguarding national security and maintaining law and order still require our all-out efforts. I am fully confident that every member of the Force, including regular, civilian and auxiliary, will continue to uphold the professional spirit of our predecessors."" He encouraged colleagues to face challenges head-on, strive for excellence and exemplify unity and strength as ""One Force"", ensuring the HKPF remains one of the finest law enforcement agencies in the world.

During the ceremony, the Police Band bugler sounded the ""Last Post"" to signal a two-minute silence. Wreaths were laid in front of the Force Memorial Wall respectively by Mr Chow; the Commandant of the Hong Kong Auxiliary Police Force, Mr Leung Sai-kwong; and representatives of various police formations and associations."
「大灣區跨境直通救護車試行計劃」周日擴展至珠海及南沙,2025-11-07 12:00,2025-11-07 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700251.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府公布「大灣區跨境直通救護車試行計劃」將由十一月九日（星期日）起擴展至珠海與南沙的指定醫院，標誌着試行計劃進入新階段。

行政長官在今年九月發表的《施政報告》中提出，聯同粵澳政府有序地擴展救護車跨境轉運病人安排，包括納入珠海和南沙兩地指定醫院並實施雙向轉運。為確保有關安排暢順，香港特區政府在九月及十月分別聯同珠海市及廣州市南沙區人民政府進行演練，測試在模擬載送病人的情況下的救護車跨境安排，過程大致順暢。試行計劃將由十一月九日起擴展至珠海市人民醫院和中山大學附屬第一醫院南沙院區。

醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授表示：「隨着粵港澳大灣區城市高度融合，區內居民因生活和工作穿梭不同灣區城市，以『點對點』方式跨境轉運病人的需求日益殷切。試行計劃的擴展將有助提升大灣區的醫療協作，為病人提供更安全、及時和便捷的轉運安排。」

「大灣區跨境直通救護車安排涉及車輛、醫護人員和藥物器材等跨境往來。安排得以順利擴展，我要衷心感謝國家多個部委，包括國務院港澳事務辦公室、國家衞生健康委員會和國家海關總署的支持及指導。我亦非常感謝廣東省、珠海市、廣州市南沙區和深圳市政府各部門共同努力，就救護車跨境直通轉運病人安排積極商討和緊密合作。另外，我要感謝特區政府多個部門及機構，包括保安局、運輸及物流局、香港警務處、香港海關、入境事務處、運輸署、衞生署和醫院管理局等通力合作。」

試行計劃於去年十一月三十日推出，首階段實行跨境直通救護車由深圳市和澳門特區的指定派送醫院（即香港大學深圳醫院和澳門仁伯爵綜合醫院）載送病人到香港的指定公立醫院。截至今年十一月初，粵港澳三地已成功轉運17名病人（深圳11名；澳門六名）到香港指定公立醫院接受治療。根據專業醫療評估，上述個案的病人有持續住院的治療需要，情況均相對穩定，但無法自行跨境，亦不適合經現有口岸轉乘救護車。病人過境時無需轉換救護車，大大減低運送期間的風險，充分體現粵港澳大灣區優質醫療衞生合作和發展持續深化。試行計劃啓動以來，整體運作良好，並會延續一年至明年十一月二十九日。

粵港澳三地政府部門會持續檢視現行轉運安排的成效及運作經驗，以病人的醫療需要、安全和利益作首要考慮，並繼續積極推進《施政報告》提出擴展救護車跨境轉運病人安排至雙向轉運的目標，期望可於明年年初實施。"
