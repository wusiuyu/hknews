It will advise the Government on the development of oral health and dental care, with a view to implementing the strategy that emphasises prevention, early identification, and timely intervention, thereby further enhancing both oral and general health of citizens of all ages.

  Oral health is an integral part of general health, and preventive oral care is a crucial component of primary healthcare. The Government released the final report of the Working Group on Oral Health and Dental Care and an action plan in December 2024, which includes adopting the strategy of widely promoting prevention-oriented primary oral healthcare among citizens across all age groups, and proposes the establishment of a steering and advisory framework, by setting up the Oral Health Group under the PHC Committee to continuously press ahead with various initiatives. Furthermore, the Chief Executive proposed to bolster public and subsidised dental services in his 2025 Policy Address to enhance oral health education, oral hygiene instructions, risk assessments, and more, in the community.

  Co-chaired by the Commissioner for Primary Healthcare, Dr Pang Fei-chau, and non-official member of the PHC Committee Dr Sigmund Leung, the Oral Health Group comprises four official members and 13 non-official members, with a term of office from November 1, 2025, to December 31, 2027. The non-official members include representatives from the dental profession, the healthcare sector, collaborating non-governmental organisations of government-subsidised dental care programmes, as well as prominent community figures. They possess rich experience and profound knowledge in relevant fields and can provide invaluable advice and recommendations to the Government on strategies for promoting oral health and the development of dental care services. The Oral Health Group will hold its first meeting in the fourth quarter of this year.

  Specifically, the terms of reference of the Oral Health Group are as follows:

(1) To monitor the progress of integrating oral health into primary healthcare;
(2) To monitor the effectiveness of various preventive measures in oral healthcare in attaining the Oral Health Goals for 2030; and
(3) To advise the Government on the further development of prevention-oriented oral healthcare, including the dental manpower supply and the development of eHealth for oral healthcare.

​行政長官在第9屆環球大灣區可持續發展經貿高峰論壇暨2025大灣區年度最具影響力大獎頒獎典禮致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-10-31 10:30,2025-10-31 10:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103000540.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十月三十一日）在第9屆環球大灣區可持續發展經貿高峰論壇——「全球鏈接·蓄勢騰飛」暨2025大灣區年度最具影響力大獎頒獎典禮的視像致辭：

施家殷會長（粵港澳大灣區經貿協會榮譽會長及召集人）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。很高興以視頻方式，參與今日的論壇暨頒獎典禮。我首先恭賀所有獲獎企業和人士，期盼大家再接再厲，共同譜寫大灣區發展的新篇章。

習近平主席指出，要使粵港澳大灣區成為新發展格局的戰略支點、高質量發展的示範地、中國式現代化的引領地。香港是大灣區中心城市和區域發展核心引擎之一，在大灣區建設中積極推動區域合作，為國家進一步改革開放發揮灣區力量。

當前，地緣政治局勢持續緊張，環球經濟格局正在重塑。在這關鍵時刻，我們更要主動對接國家策略，積極融入國家發展大局，為經濟發展開拓更多新動能。今日論壇以「全球鏈接·蓄勢騰飛」為題，匯聚各界共同探討如何把握大灣區機遇，連繫全球，彰顯我們攜手並肩，以行動貢獻灣區發展的決心。

我們會創造出海機遇，強化雙向平台功能。我在上月發表新一份《施政報告》，提出多項革新舉措，全力推進粵港澳大灣區建設。全球對「中國製造」產品需求加大，內地企業不再聚焦單一國家，積極開拓新興市場。香港憑藉「一國兩制」下國家機遇和國際機遇的雙重疊加優勢，能在灣區發展中發揮「引進來、走出去」的重要雙向平台作用。政府已成立內地企業出海專班，主動吸引內地企業，借助香港出海，拓展國際業務，進一步鞏固香港作為國際商貿樞紐的地位。

我們會加強聯通共贏，釋放灣區澎湃活力。特區政府繼續深化粵港澳三地規則和機制對接，全力提升人流、物流、數據流、資金流，加強互利合作。我們會推進香港國際機場東莞空港中心發展，研究引入更多高增值物流和跨境電商設施，更好服務大灣區的貨運需求。我們亦會優化跨境徵信互通和深港跨境數據驗證平台，便利香港銀行向在港的內地居民及企業審批貸款，促進融資，推動經貿合作。

灣區騰飛，需要匯眾智，集眾力。大灣區經貿協會一直搭建高水平交流平台，積極建言獻策。我期待各位在今日論壇中深入交流，集思廣益，為大灣區建設貢獻智慧和力量。

我期望各位對灣區發展的熱誠，會成為建設香港的實際力量。第八屆立法會的選舉提名期已經展開，我呼籲所有愛國愛港、有抱負、有能力的人士積極參選。我也請各位市民與家人朋友，緊記在十二月七日踴躍投票，一起為香港選出賢能，共創美好未來。

最後，我祝願大灣區發展更上層樓，在座各位工作順利。多謝大家。"

Hong Kong Customs conducts joint enforcement operations with FEHD regarding sale of hairy crabs (with photos),2025-10-31 10:30,2025-10-31 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103000616.htm,"Hong Kong Customs and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) have been carrying out joint enforcement operations since Monday (October 27) to inspect hairy crab retail outlets in various districts, with the aim of protecting consumer rights and upholding food safety by ensuring hairy crabs on sale in the market comply with relevant stipulations and requirements under the laws.

  During the inspections, Customs officers and officers of the Centre for Food Safety and the Environmental Hygiene Branch of the FEHD monitored the sale of hairy crabs and also checked supporting documents for the place of origin and health certificates of the hairy crabs to ensure that the hairy crabs sold at retail shops are fit for human consumption and are in compliance with the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (TDO), the Food Safety Ordinance, and the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance.

  As of now, officers of the two departments have inspected 42 hairy crab retail shops, and no irregularity has been found. The relevant joint enforcement operations will continue.

  Apart from carrying out inspections in the market, Customs officers also made use of the big-data analytics system to analyse and verify whether online shops selling hairy crabs had complied with the TDO, with a view to safeguarding the interests of consumers when making online purchases.

  Customs attaches great importance to the protection of consumer rights and will take appropriate enforcement action once activities in violation of the TDO are detected in the market. The department also reminds traders not to apply a false trade description to goods or services, or to supply or offer to supply goods or services to which a false trade description is applied. Those who violate the TDO are liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

  The FEHD reminds traders that according to the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance, all food available for sale in Hong Kong, whether imported or locally produced, should be fit for human consumption. Also, any person who operates an unlicensed food business or sells restricted foods without permission is liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and imprisonment for six months. Under the Food Safety Ordinance, any person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with the record-keeping requirement relating to movement of food commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for three months upon conviction.

  Customs and the FEHD remind traders not to import or put on sale hairy crabs with an unknown origin. Consumers should make purchases at reputable shops with the Shell Fish (Hairy Crab) Permit or relevant written permission granted by the FEHD.

  Members of the public may report any suspected violations of the TDO to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002) if they suspect that hairy crabs bought are of falsely claimed place of origin.

  In addition, if members of the public suspect that there are operators selling hairy crabs without the relevant permits/permissions or the hairy crabs are not accompanied by health certificates, they may file a report to the FEHD by calling the hotline at 2868 0000 or through email (enquiries@fehd.gov.hk)."

海關和食環署食物安全中心及環境衞生部人員除了監察大閘蟹的售賣情況外，在巡查時亦會查核大閘蟹的來源證明文件及衞生證明書，確保零售店鋪出售的大閘蟹適合供人食用，以及符合《商品說明條例》、《食物安全條例》及《公眾衞生及市政條例》的規定。

行動至今，兩個部門的人員已巡查42間大閘蟹零售店，暫時並未發現任何違法情況。有關聯合執法行動將會繼續進行。

海關人員除了在市面巡查，亦利用大數據系統分析和核實售賣大閘蟹的網店是否符合《商品說明條例》的規定，加強保障消費者在網上購物的權益。

海關十分重視保障消費者權益，如在市面發現任何涉嫌違反《商品說明條例》的活動，會立即採取相應的執法行動。海關提醒商戶不能將虛假商品說明應用於任何貨品或服務；或供應或要約供應已應用虛假商品說明的貨品或服務。如違反《商品說明條例》，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五十萬元及監禁五年。

食環署提醒商戶，根據《公眾衞生及市政條例》的規定，所有在香港出售的食物，不論進口或本地生產，必須適合供人食用；而任何人無牌經營食物業或未獲准許售賣限制出售的食物，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁六個月。而根據《食物安全條例》的規定，任何人如無合理辯解而沒有遵從備存食物進出紀錄的規定，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一萬元及監禁三個月。

海關及食環署提醒業界，切勿進口或售賣來歷不明的大閘蟹；而消費者亦應光顧信譽良好及領有食環署簽發的介貝類水產動物（大閘蟹）售賣許可證或相關書面准許的商戶。

市民如購入懷疑虛報產地的大閘蟹，可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑違反《商品說明條例》的事宜。

此外，市民如懷疑有經營者沒有持有相關許可證／准許出售大閘蟹或出售沒有衞生證明書的大閘蟹，可致電食環署熱線2868 0000，或透過電郵帳戶（enquiries@fehd.gov.hk）舉報。"

The closing time for tenders to be received is noon on July 3, 2026 (Friday).

The Smart and Green Mass Transit System (SGMTS) in Kai Tak (Kai Tak Project) is approximately 3.5 kilometres long with six stations. The termini will be connected to the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal and the MTR Kai Tak Station respectively. It will provide a convenient feeder transport service connecting the former runway area of Kai Tak to the MTR Kai Tak Station to strengthen connectivity among residential and commercial developments, tourism, culture and recreation, sports and community facilities within the area. The system is targeted to be commissioned in 2031.

A spokesperson for the Transport and Logistics Bureau said, ""The Kai Tak Project is the first SGMTS to be introduced in Hong Kong. To encourage participation of local, Mainland and overseas investors and operators, a Build-Operate-Transfer model is adopted for selecting a franchisee to finance, design, construct, operate and maintain the SGMTS in Kai Tak through an open tender. As the estimated profit from the operation of the SGMTS would not be able to cover the capital investment for construction and subsequent asset replacement, funding support will be provided through a transit-oriented development approach, where property development rights of three sites in the vicinity of the SGMTS would be granted to the future franchisee for holistic planning and development. Tenderers will be required to propose a fixed sum payable to the Government for the grant of the franchise and property development rights of the sites.""

The spokesperson further advised, ""A 'two-envelope approach' will be adopted in the tender assessment. A weighting of 60 per cent will be allocated to the assessment of the non-price proposal and 40 per cent to the price proposal. The Government will consider both the non-price and price proposals of the tenders comprehensively with a view to selecting the proposal which best fits the project intent. The detailed tender evaluation criteria are set out in the tender documents.""

Details of the tender notice are available on the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD)'s website (www.cedd.gov.hk/eng/tender-notices/contracts/tender-notices/index.html). Relevant interested parties with the capability of delivering the project (including developers, contractors, system operators, system suppliers etc) can make a request for obtaining the tender documents through the Kai Tak Project's website of the CEDD (www.ktgts.hk). Tenderers must deposit their tenders in the tender box as specified in the tender notice before the tender closing time.

這次訪問行程收穫豐富，促成了代表團成員分別與當地夥伴簽訂了五份協議或合作備忘錄，並進一步促進雙方在創新科技及數字經濟領域的交流與合作。陳茂波見證了多個簽署儀式，其中，香港貿易發展局與數字合作組織（Digital Cooperation Organization）簽署的合作備忘錄，旨在推動該組織成員經濟體的初創企業及中小企利用香港作為平台，拓展亞太市場，同時支持其成員經濟體推動數字轉型。

此外，三家來自香港及內地、分別從事人工智能、空間感知技術及機器人研發的科技企業，亦與沙特當地企業簽署戰略合作協議或合作備忘錄，涵蓋技術應用、業務拓展及應用場景等範疇，進一步促進創新技術在中東市場的發展。另外，一家從事環境科技的企業日前也與當地建築企業簽訂合作備忘錄，將其技術在沙特阿拉伯廣泛應用。

陳茂波昨日亦率領香港代表團參觀利雅得旗艦城市發展項目New Murabba。其間，陳茂波與New Murabba Development Company的首席執行官Michael Dyke會面，並出席該公司與香港代表團的交流會。

陳茂波表示，香港在城市規劃、建築設計、工程顧問、建造科技創新、以及項目管理與融資方面具備國際競爭力，業界對參與海外大型城市建設項目興趣濃厚。他邀請New Murabba Development Company赴港進行路演，為項目物色合適的合作夥伴和融資，促進兩地在城市發展及基建領域的合作。

陳茂波昨日也率領了香港代表團出席了兩場餐會，包括由當地銀行SAB舉辦的高層午餐會，以及由香港駐迪拜經濟貿易辦事處與投資推廣署合辦的「香港 — 沙特經貿晚宴」。陳茂波在兩場餐會中發表了主題演講，介紹香港最新的發展和優勢，並和與會者交流。

陳茂波指出，香港憑着「一國兩制」的獨特優勢，聯通中國和世界，是中東與中國內地以至區內經貿、投資、金融和人文往來的雙向平台。他表示，香港在金融、經貿、物流、創科等領域的優勢，加上粵港澳大灣區的協同發展，能與沙特在以上領域開展更廣泛合作，歡迎當地商界到香港和大灣區考察，探索合作機會和發展業務。

陳茂波當地時間昨日（利雅得時間十月三十日）晚上完成訪問行程，啓程回港，今日（香港時間十月三十一日）中午抵港。"
FS concludes visit to Saudi Arabia (with photos/video),2025-10-31 09:00,2025-10-31 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100082.htm,"The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, concluded the final day of his visit to Saudi Arabia yesterday (October 30, Riyadh time).

In the morning, Mr Chan met with the Governor of the Public Investment Fund (PIF), H.E. Mr Yasir Al-Rumayyan, to exchange views on deepening collaboration in the areas of investment and innovation and technology development between the two places. Mr Chan noted that over the past few years, Hong Kong and the PIF have built a solid foundation for co-operation across various sectors. He expressed hope that future collaboration can be further strengthened to contribute to the Belt and Road Initiative and support the development goals of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030.

The visit yielded fruitful outcomes, including the signing of five agreements or memoranda of understanding (MoUs) between members of the Hong Kong delegation and local partners. These covered a wide range of areas, particularly innovation and technology and the digital economy. Mr Chan witnessed several of the signing ceremonies. Among them, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and the Digital Cooperation Organization signed an MoU to promote the use of Hong Kong as a platform by start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from the organisation's member economies to access the Asia-Pacific market, while also supporting their digital transformation efforts.

In addition, three technology companies from Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland - specialising respectively in artificial intelligence, smart sensing technologies and robotics — signed strategic co-operation agreements or MoUs with Saudi enterprises. The agreements cover areas such as technology application, business development and scenario implementation, further promoting the deployment and advancement of innovative technologies in the Middle East. Separately, an environmental technology company also signed an MoU with a local construction firm to facilitate the wider application of its technologies in Saudi Arabia.

Mr Chan also led the Hong Kong delegation on a visit to the flagship urban development project in Riyadh, New Murabba. During the visit, Mr Chan met with the Chief Executive Officer of the New Murabba Development Company, Mr Michael Dyke, and attended a business exchange session between the company and the Hong Kong delegation.

Mr Chan remarked that Hong Kong possesses internationally recognised strengths in urban planning, architectural design, engineering consultancy, construction technology innovation, as well as project management and financing. He noted the keen interest of Hong Kong professionals in participating in large-scale urban development projects abroad. He invited the New Murabba Development Company to conduct a roadshow in Hong Kong to identify suitable partners and explore financing opportunities, thereby fostering collaboration in city development and infrastructure between the two sides.

Mr Chan also attended two networking events yesterday: a high-level luncheon hosted by local bank SAB, and the ""Hong Kong – Saudi Business Dinner"" co-organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Dubai and Invest Hong Kong. At both events, Mr Chan delivered keynote speeches, in which he outlined Hong Kong's latest developments and competitive advantages, and engaged in exchanges with attendees.

Mr Chan emphasised that with the unique advantages of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong serves as a two-way platform connecting the Chinese Mainland with the rest of the world. It is well positioned to facilitate trade, investment, finance and cultural exchanges between China and the Middle East, as well as the wider region. He added that Hong Kong's strengths in finance, commerce, logistics, and innovation and technology, together with its integration with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, offer significant potential for broader collaboration with Saudi Arabia. He welcomed members of the Saudi business community to visit Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area to explore co-operation opportunities and expand their business.

Mr Chan concluded his visit to Saudi Arabia last night (October 30, Riyadh time) and will return to Hong Kong at around noon time today (October 31, Hong Kong time)."

Government highly concerned about complaint handling mechanism of MCHK,2025-10-30 20:15,2025-10-30 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000802.htm,"  In response to the recent decision of the Medical Council of Hong Kong (MCHK) to stay the proceedings of an inquiry case permanently, the Government issued the following statement today (October 30):

  Healthcare professions in Hong Kong have all along observed the principle of professional autonomy, with the statutory bodies responsible for regulating the healthcare professions, upholding and uplifting their professional standards and ethical conduct, thereby protecting the interest of patients. The Government reiterates that all regulatory bodies of healthcare professions have the responsibility to handle complaints against professionals through an investigation and disciplinary mechanism that is fair, impartial, transparent and efficient, with a view to ensuring healthcare professional standards and patient safety and fostering mutual trust between patients and healthcare professionals. When discharging their duties, regulatory bodies must be accountable to the public for safeguarding the overall interest of society.

  The Government is highly concerned about the handling of the relevant complaint case. The Secretary for Health has written to the Chairman of the MCHK requesting the MCHK to provide an account on the mechanism in handling complaint investigation and disciplinary inquiries, and to carry out a holistic review and introduce improvement recommendations in the light of the complaint case, to respond to the expectation of society and the public concerning the standard and ethical conduct of healthcare professionals. The MCHK must uphold its mission of ensuring justice, maintaining professionalism and protecting the public.

  The Health Bureau expressed regards to the patient and parents involved, and will follow up with relevant government departments on the patient’s medical and welfare needs."
Influenza activity remains high in Hong Kong and Territory-wide Sewage Surveillance Programme will cover seasonal influenza viruses,2025-10-30 20:10,2025-10-30 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000799.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced today (October 30) that influenza activity in Hong Kong has remained at a relatively high level, with schoolchildren being the most affected group. The CHP urged schools and parents to arrange for children to receive the free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) as soon as possible, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination can also reduce the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

Influenza activity remains at high level
----------------------------------------------

The CHP's latest surveillance data showed that the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for seasonal influenza viruses during the past week (October 19 to 25) was 12.01 per cent, similar to the 11.84 per cent recorded during the preceding week. It has surpassed the peak of 10.54 per cent recorded during the winter influenza season earlier this year. Influenza A (H3) is the predominant circulating strain, accounting for nearly 90 per cent of all detected viruses, followed by influenza A (H1) accounting for nearly 10 per cent. Influenza B accounted for the remainder. The influenza admission rate in public hospitals is 0.64 cases per 10 000 population, which was lower than 0.87 cases recorded in the preceding week. The outbreaks of influenza-like illness (ILI) in schools and residential care homes remained at a high level. As of yesterday (October 29), a total of 693 ILI outbreaks have been reported in schools since the start of the school year in September, including 73 outbreaks in kindergartens/child care centres, 376 outbreaks in primary schools and 244 outbreaks in secondary schools.There have been 16 severe paediatric influenza cases since the start of the school year in September, including one fatal case. The affected children aged from 11 months to 17 years, with 11 having good past health.ãã

  ""Based on the current level of influenza activity and trend analysis, the local influenza activity is expected to remain at a relatively high level over the next few weeks.Furthermore, viruses tend to become more active when temperatures drop. The winter influenza season in Hong Kong typically occurs between January and March. The current summer influenza season may overlap with the upcoming winter influenza season, which could lead to more hospitalisations due to influenza infection than in previous years. I urge all persons aged six months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV, to act promptly, particularly those high-risk groups such as the elderly, children, and adults with underlying illnesses and immunosuppression. Members of the public may also contact their family doctors to arrange for vaccinations,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

Members of the public, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if presented with fever and respiratory symptoms, for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to the Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Territory-wide Sewage Surveillance Programme to cover seasonal influenza virus
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hong Kong has long maintained comprehensive communicable disease surveillance systems to monitor the activity levels of various communicable diseases in Hong Kong. This system includes surveillance of statutory notifiable infectious diseases, sentinel surveillance, outbreak surveillance, laboratory surveillance and sewage surveillance. To further enhance the capability of monitoring seasonal influenza in Hong Kong, the CHP's Territory-wide Sewage Surveillance Programme will include seasonal influenza viruses, aiming to enhance surveillance and early warning capabilities, thereby enabling the timely formulation of public health response measures to better safeguard public health.

""The Territory-wide Sewage Surveillance Programme is a major breakthrough in surveillance of communicable diseases in recent years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the novel approach of detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus load in sewage became a vital tool for tracking the virus and identifying the source of infection locally.Currently, COVID-19 has become endemic and is managed as a common respiratory disease. The objective of COVID-19 sewage surveillance has shifted from source tracing to routine surveillance of the virus activity in the community,"" Dr Tsui said.

""The CHP has been exploring ways to optimise the sewage surveillance programme by gradually expanding it to monitor other communicable diseases based on research findings. Since late last year, the CHP has launched a pilot scheme to analyse data on seasonal influenza using collected sewage samples, comparing the results with existing local influenza surveillance trends based on laboratory respiratory specimens. The results showed that the trends of sewage viral load were highly correlated with the percentage of respiratory specimens that tested positive. The results confirmed that sewage surveillance effectively reflects local seasonal influenza activity. Sewage monitoring detects trend changes earlier than the current indicators based on medical institutions, such as clinics, hospitals and clinical laboratories. The relevant results are disseminated through the latest issue of ""Communicable Diseases Watch"" published today. Building on the success of the pilot scheme, the CHP has regularised this initiative as a supplementary indicator to the traditional influenza surveillance system. Starting this week, the CHP will release weekly monitoring data through the COVID-19 & Flu Express for reference by healthcare professionals and the public,"" Dr Tsuiadded.

""The DH will continue to proactively explore the latest scientific developments and applications of sewage surveillance. Based on the local epidemiological situation, the DH will expand the scope of sewage surveillance to include other infectious diseases at an appropriate time, thereby providing comprehensive protection for public health and safeguarding the well-being of the community,"" Dr Tsui said.

As announced in the 2023 Policy Address, the Government will enhance local capacity in surveillance, early warning, as well as prevention and control of emerging communicable diseases. The Hong Kong Jockey Club has provided funding support. The Territory-wide Sewage Surveillance Programme is part of the abovementioned programmes."

面對日漸頻繁和複雜多變的商業環境，企業之間的商業爭議往往是無可避免的。無論是對於來自香港、內地或海外的企業，如何能妥善、有效地解決業務過程中可能出現的糾紛，必然是企業風險管理中非常重要的一環。但在實務上，爭議解決條款往往出現在合約的末後部分，而在大多數情況下，爭議解決條款的內容並非合約雙方的主要考慮因素，因此企業客戶一般交由律師擬訂有關條款的內容。雖然如此，一套有效的爭議解決機制對企業管理的重要性卻是不容忽視的。

就此，合約雙方需要作出兩個重要的決定，第一，該如何解決任何潛在的商業爭議，例如選擇透過訴訟或仲裁解決爭議；第二，該在甚麼地方解決爭議，是香港、內地，還是其他司法管轄區。當然，在作出上述決定時必須考慮個別事宜或案件的具體情況，但藉今天的機會，我希望能讓大家明白，不論你是來自任何背景，選擇以香港仲裁來解決商業爭議絕對是個明智的決定。

相信不用我多說，大家都知道香港是全球領先且備受國際用家推崇和信賴的仲裁地。在倫敦大學瑪麗皇后學院進行的《2025年國際仲裁調查》中，香港與新加坡並列成為全球第二受歡迎的仲裁地點，更同時獲選為亞太區首選仲裁地。香港本地著名的仲裁機構——香港國際仲裁中心的仲裁規則亦獲評為亞太地區最受歡迎的仲裁規則，與新加坡國際仲裁中心並列全球第二。此外，香港在《波羅的海國際航運公會法律及仲裁條款 2020》中被納入為四個指定仲裁地之一。究竟是甚麼原因令香港能成為享負國際盛名的仲裁地？我認為至少有以下六個主要原因。

第一，香港的仲裁法律框架與國際規則高度接軌。香港是中國內地以外唯一一個普通法司法管轄區，我們的普通法與世界主要經濟體的法律同屬一系。香港的《仲裁條例》（第609章）以《聯合國國際貿易法委員會國際商事仲裁示範法》作為藍本，不論民法或普通法司法管轄區的法律從業員和國際商界均對示範法十分熟悉。在《仲裁條例》下，國際仲裁的核心優勢得以被完好保留，例如仲裁的保密性，這相對公開的訴訟程序更能保障企業的隱私，除了能避免企業的聲譽受損，更有助於保持與商業夥伴的長遠關係。

第二，香港的仲裁法律框架提供了一站式具效率的爭議解決程序。由香港國際仲裁中心提供的數字顯示，在二○一三年十一月至二○二三年四月期間按照《香港國際仲裁中心機構仲裁規則》管理而得到最終裁決的仲裁程序的平均時長為17.7個月。該中心亦提供簡易仲裁程序供當事人選擇，讓當事人能更迅速地解決爭議。

第三，香港提供多種靈活的仲裁資金選項，當中包括第三者資助仲裁。有關條例於二○一九年二月生效，釐清香港允許在仲裁及附屬的法庭程序中使用第三者資助。而在二○二二年十二月十六日起，與仲裁結果有關的收費架構（ORFSA）制度更在香港全面實施。有關制度下允許三種類型的ORFSA協議，為當事人及其律師提供靈活性，按某事宜的結果達成費用安排。截至今年九月，律政司從香港仲裁機構提供的資料得知分別有92宗和21宗仲裁案件披露了使用第三者資助仲裁和與仲裁結果有關的收費架構。

第四， 香港法院對在香港進行的仲裁有監督權，而香港的司法機構一向以高質素、獨立、尊崇法治而聞名，亦明確支持使用仲裁解決爭議。法院一般會維護仲裁員的廣泛酌情權及仲裁程序的中立性和靈活性，不會輕易撤銷仲裁裁決。

第五，在仲裁過後，能否執行仲裁裁決是非常關鍵的實際考慮因素，因為一個能被強制執行的仲裁裁決才能真正保障裁決債權人在仲裁結果中的權益。事實上，仲裁裁決在國際間的認可性和強制執行性亦是國際仲裁比訴訟更受歡迎的最主要原因之一。香港的仲裁裁決可依據《承認及執行外國仲裁裁決公約》在超過170個締約國強制執行。此外，香港自回歸祖國以來與內地簽署了九項民商事案件相互司法協助安排，在一九九九年簽訂的《關於內地與香港特別行政區相互執行仲裁裁決的安排》為兩地相互執行仲裁裁決提供了簡單有效的機制，便利香港的仲裁裁決可以在內地法院強制執行。為進一步完善《執行安排》，香港政府與最高人民法院於二○二○年簽署了相關的《補充安排》，包括允許當事人可以同時向兩地的法院申請執行仲裁裁決，為內地與香港建立更便捷的仲裁互助機制。

第六，香港的仲裁制度尊重當事人的自主權，讓他們能以不同的方式進行仲裁，使仲裁的過程和配套能真正切合他們的需要。除了本地設立的香港國際仲裁中心，不少備受尊崇的國際及內地仲裁機構也選擇落戶香港，包括華南（香港）國際仲裁院、中國國際經濟貿易仲裁委員會香港分會等，能為仲裁用家提供專業優質的服務。在香港進行仲裁時，當事人亦可自由選擇仲裁的適用法律，而非一定要使用香港法作為仲裁的適用法。從數字上來看，單是去年提交香港國際仲裁中心的仲裁案件已涉及15個不同司法管轄區的適用法律，其中最常被當事人選擇的適用法律為香港法、英國法，以及我們國家的法律。此外，當事人亦可自行選擇和委任仲裁員而不受國籍限制。以香港國際仲裁中心為例，在二○二四年，在所有由仲裁中心指定的仲裁員中， 30.9%來自香港，21.2%來自英國，亦有7.1%來自內地。同樣，當事人亦可以自由選擇委任來自其他司法管轄區的律師而不受國籍或仲裁爭議適用法律等限制。在不少案件中，內地和香港律師甚至可以在同一個法律團隊中共同擔任律師。當事人亦可選擇以中文或英文，甚至中英雙語作為仲裁適用的語言。在去年香港國際仲裁中心的機構仲裁案件中，79.3%以英文進行，15.9%以中文進行，4.3%以中英雙語進行，其他則未有指定仲裁語言。

對中國內地企業和與中國內地有商業聯繫的海外華商來說，能夠以我們都熟悉的語言——中文進行仲裁尤其重要。在香港，大多數從事仲裁的律師都是華人且精通中英雙語。他們一方面能夠以自己擅長的語言和客戶進行有效的溝通，另一方面亦對中國文化和商業慣例十分熟悉。與此同時，他們在國際仲裁方面也擁有豐富的經驗和高水準的專業知識，無疑融匯了中方與西方制度的雙重優勢。

香港特區政府在中央政府的大力支持下，一直致力打造香港仲裁的品牌成為更便捷、更以用家為本的國際爭議解決選項。首先，自今年三月起，香港政府實施了「為來港參與仲裁程序的人士提供入境便利計劃」，容許合資格人士以訪客身分來港參與仲裁程序，無須取得工作簽證。計劃涵蓋（1）仲裁員；（2）專家證人和事實證人；（3）代表仲裁程序任何一方的律師；（4）仲裁程序各方；及（5）與仲裁直接有關或參與仲裁的其他人士，例如仲裁庭秘書、仲裁庭指定專家等。這些措施將便利國際專業人才和仲裁用家參與香港的仲裁程序，進一步提升香港作為國際一流仲裁地的吸引力。另外，「港資港法」和「港資港仲裁」的擴展亦已經自二○二五年二月起實施。再者，行政長官在剛公布的二○二五年《施政報告》中指出，政府將繼續研究是否需要對《仲裁條例》作出修訂，以保持香港仲裁法的長遠競爭力。

我們期盼未來各位能更加積極考慮使用香港的仲裁服務。這不僅有助於提升爭議解決的效率與公信力，也與國家加強香港作為國際法律與爭議解決服務中心的政策高度配合。

最後，我希望藉今日這個重要場合呼籲各位具選民資格的嘉賓和朋友，於十二月七日立法會選舉日踴躍投票。你們投下的每一票，對特區未來的施政、經濟的發展和市民的生活有着舉足輕重的影響。

回到今日的主題，我祝願中總發展蒸蒸日上，祝各位在座嘉賓業務順利、身體健康。謝謝大家！"

基孔肯雅熱最新情況（附圖）,2025-10-30 19:55,2025-10-30 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000769.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月三十日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————

就日前確診基孔肯雅熱但感染源頭有待確定的55歲女子，病毒基因分析工作仍在進行。

本港今年累計錄得52宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案。撇除上述個案，一宗屬本地個案，50宗屬輸入個案。

此外，由十月二十六日至今日下午五時，中心已透過設於鳳德商場二樓的醫護站、熱線電話及於鳳德邨進行上門探訪，為約6 700名居民作評估，當中發現34名出現輕微病徵的市民，中心已安排他們接受抽血檢查，化驗工作正陸續進行，暫時已完成檢驗的樣本全部對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府繼續全方位防控基孔肯雅熱
——————————————

中心正繼續聯同政府多個部門和相關機構採取適當防控措施，全力預防基孔肯雅熱在本地扎根和減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

中心今日晚上八時三十分會舉行第二場網上講座，由醫生講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況、如何預防受感染、如何正確使用昆蟲驅避劑等。

中心人員和當區關愛隊已向當區約八千戶民居派發問卷及宣傳單張，並會繼續聯絡居民發放資訊，了解及跟進他們的健康情況。中心亦已發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺。

另外，中心由十月二十六日起設立熱線（電話：2125 2373）及上述的醫護站，每日由上午九時至下午八時運作，為出現相關症狀的居民作評估和解答市民有關基孔肯雅熱的查詢。

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever (with photo),2025-10-30 19:55,2025-10-30 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000770.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 30), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
-------------------------------

  Regarding the confirmed CF case involving a 55-year-old female with the source of infection yet to be confirmed, the genome analysis is still under way.

 So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 52 confirmed CF cases. Excluding the abovementioned case, there are one local case and 50 imported cases.

In addition, from October 26 to 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for about 6 700 residents through the health consultation booth on the second floor of Fung Tak Shopping Centre, its inquiry hotline and door-to-door visits in Fung Tak Estate. Among them, 34 individuals with mild symptoms have been arranged to undergo blood tests. Laboratory testing is continuing; so far, those samples that have completed testing are all negative for the chikungunya virus.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's continuous comprehensive actions on prevention and control of CF
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CHP continued to implement various prevention and control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

The CHP will hold the second online live seminar at 8.30pm tonight. Doctors will explain the latest situation of CF, how to prevent infection and how to properly use insect repellents.

The CHP officers and District Services & Community Care Teams have distributed questionnaires and promotional leaflets to about 8 000 households in the district and will continue to contact the residents, disseminate information, and understand and follow up on their health conditions. The CHP has also issued letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and reminding them to be vigilant.

In addition, the CHP has set up an inquiry hotline (2125 2373) and the abovementioned health consultation booth. The hotline and health consultation booth will continue to operate from 9am to 8pm daily to provide assessments to residents with relevant symptoms and answer enquiries relating to CF.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

ãã
âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

â
âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.
ã
The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
DCS chairs first meeting of AI Efficacy Enhancement Team (with photos),2025-10-30 19:52,2025-10-30 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000754.htm,"  The Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, chaired the first meeting of the AI Efficacy Enhancement Team today (October 30), co-ordinating policy bureaux and departments (B/Ds) in using artificial intelligence technology to boost governmental efficiency and spur technological innovation. The Team also discussed its work plan and timetable.

 Mr Cheuk noted that AI is one of the most influential information technologies nowadays and a key factor in promoting new quality productive forces, smart city and high-quality development. It is also an essential tool for enhancing public governance. To implement the objective of strengthening governance as outlined by the Chief Executive in the 2025 Policy Address, the Team will make good use of co-ordination to steer government departments to effectively apply AI technology to their work, explore process re-engineering, and promote technological reform in departments to improve efficacy, so as to drive government departments to enhance efficacy and better respond to the public's expectations for efficient government and quality public services.

 Mr Cheuk added, ""The Team will identify departments that can use AI to enhance performance having regard to the following directions. First is departments with greater interface with the public.

香港流感活躍程度維持在高水平　「全港性污水病毒監測計劃」將涵蓋季節性流感病毒,2025-10-30 19:12,2025-10-30 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000742.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月三十日）表示，本港現時流感活躍度仍然維持在較高水平，而學童是最為受影響的群組。中心敦促學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

流感活躍程度維持在高水平

中心最新監測數據顯示，過去一周（十月十九至二十五日），呼吸道樣本中流感病毒檢測呈陽性的百分比為12.01%，與前一周錄得的11.84%相若，並已超越今年初冬季流感季節最高一周的10.54%。目前主要流行的病毒為甲型（H3）流感，佔整體病毒檢測接近九成，其次為甲型（H1）流感，佔接近一成，餘下則為乙型流感。公立醫院住院病人被診斷為流感的入院率為每一萬人有0.64宗入院個案，低於前一周的0.87宗。學校或院舍的流感樣疾病爆發個案維持在較高水平，截至昨日（十月二十九日），自九月開學以來，涉及學校的流感樣疾病爆發個案共有693宗，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（73宗）、小學（376宗）及中學（244宗）。由九月開學至今，共有16宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，當中包括一宗死亡個案，年齡介乎11個月大至17歲，其中11人過往的健康狀況良好。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「按目前流感活躍程度和趨勢分析，流感活躍程度在未來幾星期預計仍會維持在較高水平。另一方面，氣溫下降，病毒一般會較活躍。香港的冬季流感季節大多在一月至三月期間出現，今次夏季流感季節有可能與下一個冬季流感重疊，導致因感染流感而住院的人數較以往更多。我呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動，特別是高風險群組，例如長者、兒童，及患有慢性疾病和免疫抑制的成年人。市民亦可以聯絡自己的家庭醫生安排接種。」

市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

「全港性污水病毒監測計劃」涵蓋季節性流感病毒

香港一直以來擁有完善的傳染病監測系統，以監測各種傳染病在本港的活躍程度，包括法定呈報傳染病監測、定點監測、聚集性疫情監測、實驗室監測、污水監測等。為進一步加強監測本地季節性流感的能力，中心的「全港性污水病毒監測計劃」將涵蓋季節性流感病毒，以提升監測及預警能力，從而適時制訂公共衞生應對措施，更全面保障公眾健康。

徐樂堅醫生說：「『全港性污水病毒監測計劃』是傳染病監測系統近年的一大突破。新冠疫情期間，利用污水檢測2019冠狀病毒病（新冠）病毒含量的新方法，已成為本地追蹤病毒傳播和識別感染源頭的重要工具。目前，新冠病毒已成為風土病，按一般呼吸道疾病處理，新冠污水監測的目標亦已從個案追蹤轉為恆常監測病毒在社區的活躍程度。」

他續說: 「中心一直不斷研究及優化污水病毒監測計劃，並逐步按研究結果擴展至其他傳染病的監測。中心去年底起開展先導計劃，利用已收集的污水樣本對季節性流感進行數據分析，並與本地現有基於實驗室呼吸道樣本的流感監測趨勢作對比。結果顯示，污水病毒載量與呼吸道樣本的陽性率趨勢高度吻合，確認污水監測能有效反映本地季節性流感情況，污水監測比目前使用的基於醫療機構的監測指標（例如診所、醫院、臨床實驗室）能更早發現趨勢變化。有關結果已於今日出版的新一期《傳染病直擊》發表。因應先導計劃的成功經驗，中心把相關計劃恆常化，作為傳統流感監測系統的補充指標。中心自本周起透過《2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞》每星期發布相關監測數據，予醫護人員和公眾參考。」

徐樂堅醫生說：「衞生署會繼續積極研究污水監測的最新科學發展及應用，按本地流行病學情況，適時擴大污水監測應用範圍至其他傳染病，全方位保障公共衞生和守護市民健康。」

​二○二三年《施政報告》宣布政府會提升本地監測、預警和防控疫情能力，而香港賽馬會出資作支持。「全港性污水病毒監測計劃」為上述項目的一部分。"

He was certified dead later at the scene. The LD is saddened by death of the worker and expresses its deepest sympathy to his family.

The LD's spokesman said, ""We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and have issued a suspension notice to the employer concerned, suspending the use of electric chainsaws for tree-related work. The employer cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that suitable measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken.""

The spokesman added, ""We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the relevant duty holder and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation.""

To prevent employees from being injured while operating electric chainsaws, the LD reminds employers to provide relevant employees with suitable personal protective equipment (including protective clothing, safety boots, protective gloves, safety helmets, eye protectors and ear protectors) as well as adequate information, instruction, training and supervision for the safe operation of electric chainsaws.

The general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance require employers to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

In regard to yesterday's accident, the LD will issue a Work Safety Alert through its mobile application ""OSH 2.0"", website and email, giving a brief account of the accident to duty holders, workers' unions, professional bodies of safety practitioners and others, and reminding the industry of the importance of following safety precautionary measures to prevent a recurrence of similar accidents.

The LD will also remind the employer concerned of the liability for employees' compensation under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, assist family members of the deceased to claim employees' compensation and closely follow up on the case. For those with financial difficulties, the LD will assist them to apply for appropriate emergency funds. Subject to the needs and wishes of the family members of the deceased, the LD will also liaise with the Social Welfare Department for financial or other assistance.

For the sake of securing the safety and health of employees at work, the LD appeals to employers to provide plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health. Employees shall also co-operate with their employers to adopt all safety measures, refrain from wearing loose clothing and use provided personal protective equipment properly while operating electric chainsaws to avoid endangering their own safety and that of other workers."

海關人員八月五日及十月二十九日在香港國際機場截查兩名分別五十歲及三十二歲的抵港男旅客。海關人員在五十歲抵港男旅客所攜帶的個人行李內檢獲約一萬一千二百件另類吸煙產品，估計市值約三萬三千六百元，及在三十二歲抵港男旅客的個人行李內檢獲約四萬六千四百支未完稅香煙，估計市值約二十萬九千元，應課稅值約十五萬三千元。該兩名男旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

One of them was also fined $1,500.

Customs officers intercepted a 50-year-old and a 32-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on August 5 and October 29 respectively. About 11 200 alternative smoking products, with an estimated market value of about $33,600, were seized from the personal baggage of the 50-year-old incoming male passenger. Also, about 46 400 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $209,000 and a duty potential of about $153,000 in total, were seized from the 32-year-old male passenger's personal baggage.

The 50-year-old male passenger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment by the court today for contravening the IEO, while the 32-year-old male passenger was sentenced to four months' imprisonment and fined $1,500 for contravening the DCO.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

保安局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-10-30 18:10,2025-10-30 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000700.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（十月三十日）出席《安熊童樂會》校園巡禮啓動儀式後會見傳媒的談話內容：

保安局局長：各位香港市民，各位記者朋友。今日我來到大圍，是為了我們一個進入校園、在幼稚園宣傳國家安全的宣傳活動。其實保安局過往已經用了兩個卡通人物角色——一個叫安仔，另一個叫保安熊仔——用這兩個角色向小朋友宣揚有關國家安全的重要性和一些知識。我們以往有漫畫、繪本和動漫，現在我們更加將兩個卡通人物帶入幼稚園，再加上由保安局青少年制服團隊領袖論壇的一些義工哥哥姐姐朋友用國安隊長的身分，帶領着兩個卡通人物進入幼稚園，講國家安全的故事。我們希望能夠將國家安全的意識，令小朋友從小——在幼稚園中——已經能夠明白。

我亦想趁此機會再提一提大家，十二月七日是立法會換屆選舉的日子，希望大家踴躍投票，選出愛國愛港和有能力的人士，在立法會服務社會。

另外我都想講一講，我留意到在網上有人繼續勸人投白票或不投票。我想重新強調，這些行為不但有機會違反《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》，亦有機會違反《香港國安法》。我們一定會根據證據，如有需要，會採取果斷執法行動。

我特別留意到通緝犯許智峯——這個「叫人衝，自己鬆」、因為違反《香港國安法》而被法庭發出手令通緝、因為說謊欺騙法庭然後潛逃到別處而被通緝，再加上他是因為叫人不投票而違反《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》而被廉政公署通緝的人士——繼續在網上散布叫人不要投票的信息。我想說，這個做法是非常惡毒。你自己違法被人通緝，是你的事，你還想別人跟你一樣犯法。我希望大家能夠認清事實，千萬不要被他蒙蔽而從事一些違法行為。這是我想在此作出的呼籲，謝謝大家。

記者：國安處（警務處國家安全處）今日剛剛落案起訴了吳子樂，即口岸爆炸案其中一個罪脫的被告。想問為何追溯至二○一九年？為何國安處或警方需要六年調查？是否在搜證上有甚麼難度？還有說這是一個全新的罪名，是否其實是等法官宣判口岸爆炸案剩下的三個罪成的被告才採取執法行動？

保安局局長：國安處最近拘捕了五名人士，是與二○一九年黑暴有關，包括煽動暴動和提供武器，而我們今日正式落案控告兩名人士。我想跟大家說，你違了法，特別是危害國家安全或者（涉及）一些煽動暴力的案件，無論你潛逃了多久、離開了多久，只要我們掌握到足夠證據，就會將你拘捕；有進一步足夠證據，就會將你檢控。這是沒有時限的，任何時間，我們有證據就會拘捕、檢控。

記者：想問剛才有提到留意到有人散播投白票，可能會違反《香港國安法》。可否說說是怎樣違反《香港國安法》？除了許智峯的例子之外，會不會留意到有本地的例子有違反？會怎樣執法？

保安局局長：剛才我講過，我留意到潛逃者、逃犯許智峯公然在網上叫人從事一些違法行為。我在此再次譴責和希望提醒市民，不僅不要受騙、做他叫你做的行為，亦不要將相關媒體轉載，因為這有可能是違法。這不但可能違反《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》，而如果你勾結外國勢力從而希望影響或操控選舉，這有機會是違反《香港國安法》。

記者：關於的士司機箍頸案，看到警員林偉榮都提出要求推翻裁決，其實警方是否已開始調查工作？會否考慮刑事檢控？還有會否參考陪審團有關在警車內安裝CCTV的建議？

保安局局長：就着你提到的案件，我們已經留意到死因庭相關判詞。警方現時和律政司已經在研究，究竟下一步應該採取甚麼行動。謝謝大家。"
​行政長官在2025金融街論壇閉幕式致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-10-30 18:00,2025-10-30 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000536.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十月三十日）在2025金融街論壇閉幕式的視像致辭：

各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。我很高興以視頻方式參與2025金融街論壇年會閉幕式。

金融街論壇在二○一二年創辦，現在已成為國家級、國際性專業論壇，是國家重要的國際金融交流合作平台。我首先熱烈恭賀今年金融街論壇年會圓滿成功，成果豐碩。

當前，世界百年未有之大變局加速演進。面對全球經濟和金融環境轉變，世界各地政府以至企業，都要制訂更強韌、可持續的發展戰略，通過創新及共融理念，強化金融市場的合作和發展。今年的論壇以「創新、變革、重塑下的全球金融發展」為主題，匯聚全球多個國家和地區的政府和企業交流互鑑，正當其時。

香港作為國際金融中心，積極發揮「一國兩制」下內聯外通的獨特優勢，為國家金融高質量發展貢獻力量。在最新的《全球金融中心指數》排名中，香港繼續保持全球第三、亞洲第一，與全球第一和第二的分數差距只是兩分和一分，充分肯定香港作為國際金融中心的領先地位。

金融是現代經濟的核心，唯有持續創新、主動變革、勇於重塑，才能在變局中開創新局。我在上月發表的《施政報告》中，提出一系列措施，持續鞏固提升香港國際金融中心地位，同時加速發展經濟新增長點，開拓新機遇。

首先，我們會繼續強化股票市場。今年香港股票市場表現亮麗，今年首九個月的每天平均成交額超過2,500億港元，比去年同期翻了一倍。新股集資額方面，到九月底已累計超過1,800億港元，按年大增兩倍以上，金額位列全球第一。

特區政府會通過新設立的「科企專線」，協助內地科技企業來港融資，為國家建設科技強國貢獻金融力量。我們也會鼓勵及協助在海外上市的中概股回流，讓香港成為它們的首選回歸地。

第二，我們會繼續深化香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通。截至今年九月，「滬深港通」北向交易平均每天交易額超過2,000億人民幣；而南向交易平均每天交易額則超過1,200億港元，反映香港連接內地資本市場的重要橋樑功能。

我們會爭取盡快落實將人民幣交易櫃台納入「港股通」，並將房地產投資信託基金納入互聯互通標的，同時鼓勵更多上市公司增加人民幣股票交易櫃台。

第三，我們會加強香港作為全球最大離岸人民幣業務中心的優勢。目前，香港處理全球約百分之75的離岸人民幣支付款額。截至今年八月底，香港人民幣存款餘額約1萬億元人民幣，為全球離岸人民幣交易和金融活動提供流動性支持。

為了強化香港離岸人民幣市場的樞紐功能，我們會優化目前的人民幣流動資金安排，讓銀行業有更大的空間和彈性，管理短期人民幣流動性。

「不日新者必日退」。在鞏固既有優勢同時，我們也要全力發展新增長點，主動求進求變，適應新形勢、新挑戰。其中，我們會加速建立國際黃金交易市場，拓展黃金倉儲，建造區域黃金儲備樞紐。我們也會建立香港黃金中央清算系統，為國際標準黃金交易提供高效可信的清算服務。

香港一直積極發揮「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台作用，我們會強化香港的出海平台優勢，攜手更多內地企業創造商機。特區政府已成立內地企業出海專班，匯聚各界專業人士的力量，為內地企業提供全方位支援，讓更多內地企業以香港作為跳板，走向世界。

我們會研究優化稅務寬減措施，吸引更多內地企業在香港設立財資中心，同時推動銀行業，尤其是內地銀行在香港設立區域總部，用香港的專業服務，開拓東南亞和中東等新興地區市場。

在綠色可持續金融發展方面，去年在香港安排發行的綠色和可持續債券總額約430億美元，佔亞洲區總額約百分之四十五，連續七年位居亞洲區市場的首位。

香港交易所也會加強與大灣區碳市場的試點合作，試驗跨境交易結算路徑，共建區內碳市場生態圈。我們將繼續善用香港深廣的資本市場，為區域可持續發展作出貢獻。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，香港作為國際金融中心，會繼續全力發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，改革創新，自強不息，為國家高質量發展作出更大貢獻。

最後，我再次恭賀2025金融街論壇年會圓滿成功，祝願在座各位工作順利，事業蒸蒸日上。謝謝大家。"

"SCED attends APEC Ministerial Meeting in Gyeongju, Korea (with photos)",2025-10-30 17:00,2025-10-30 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000538.htm," The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, today (October 30) attended the 36th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministerial Meeting in Gyeongju, Korea.

 The theme for APEC this year is ""Building a Sustainable Tomorrow"". At a discussion session entitled ""Innovate and Prosper"", Mr Yau shared with other ministers Hong Kong's efforts to promote digitalisation for the prosperity of people and future generations.

 Mr Yau said that the rapid development of digital technologies, particularly AI, is fundamentally changing societies at an unprecedented pace. To fully harness the benefits and smoothen the transformation process, Hong Kong strongly supports deepening APEC's digital co-operation to foster economic growth and address common challenges.

 He highlighted the importance of strengthening infrastructure and adopting an application-oriented approach to promote deep integration of AI across the economy. To this end, Hong Kong has been taking concrete actions, such as developing an additional high-performing data facility cluster to provide advanced computing power for innovation, promoting AI adoption by accelerating the digital transformation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and upgrading Hong Kong's trade architecture with AI.

 Mr Yau added that with a people-centred approach, Hong Kong is tackling key challenges such as digital divides and job displacement that are impeding an inclusive digital transition. Apart from incorporating AI literacy into schools' core curriculums and enhancing teacher training, Hong Kong is also reforming retraining programmes and strengthening re-employment support for the current workforce.

 Speaking at another session entitled ""Connect"", Mr Yau stressed that in navigating the increasingly complex landscape, the multilateral trading system underpinned by the World Trade Organization (WTO) continues to play a pivotal role.

 ""The WTO, with its core principles of non-discrimination and co-operation as well as various critical roles and functions, has led world trade to flourish for decades. In these unprecedented and challenging times, we believe that an open, stable, transparent, inclusive and predictable rules-based international trading environment is more crucial than ever, particularly for less developed economies, enabling them not just to survive but also to thrive on emerging opportunities,"" he stressed.

 Mr Yau said that APEC itself has also been active in addressing issues that affect the region, such as enhancing the resilience of supply chains against shocks and threats. Being an externally oriented economy, seamless and effective supply chains are essential to Hong Kong.

 He added that Hong Kong has leveraged technological innovations in this context, such as the application of AI to facilitate customs enforcement, cargo clearance and matching for airline partnerships. Hong Kong is also actively building connectivity on trade single window with key trading partners such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

 On the sidelines of the meeting, Mr Yau separately met with the Vice Minister and Deputy China International Trade Representative of the Ministry of Commerce, Mr Ling Ji; the Deputy Minister for Trade of Korea, Mr Park Jong-won; the Minister of Foreign Trade and Tourism of Peru, Ms Teresa Stella Mera Gómez; the Minister for Trade and Investment of New Zealand, Mr Todd McClay; and the Minister of Trade of Indonesia, Mr Budi Santoso, to exchange views on issues of mutual concern.

 Mr Yau will return to Hong Kong tomorrow (October 31)."

今年亞太經合組織的主題為「我們構築的可持續明天」。丘應樺在題為「創新與繁榮」的討論環節上，與其他部長分享香港致力推動數字化以促進人民及未來世代繁榮發展。

丘應樺表示，數字技術，特別是人工智能的急速發展，正以前所未有的速度從根本改變社會。為充分利用其效益並順利轉型，香港堅定支持深化亞太經合組織的數字合作，以促進經濟增長和應對共同挑戰。

他指出，加強基建和採用應用導向策略，對促進人工智能深度融入各行業十分重要。就此，香港一直採取實際行動，包括增建高性能數據園區，以先進算力推動創新；通過加快中、小及微型企業數字轉型以促進人工智能的應用；以及運用人工智能提升香港的貿易架構等。

丘應樺續說，香港採取以人為本的方式，應對數字鴻溝和工種轉移等窒礙包容數字轉型的主要挑戰。除了將人工智能素養納入學校核心課程和加強教師培訓外，香港亦正改革再培訓計劃，並加強對現有勞動力的再就業支援。

在另一場題為「連接」的討論環節上，丘應樺重申，在應對日益複雜的局勢時，以世界貿易組織（世貿組織）為基礎的多邊貿易制度繼續發揮關鍵作用。

他強調：「世貿組織秉持不歧視和協作的核心原則，加上其各種重要的角色和功能，在過去數十年引領全球貿易蓬勃發展。在這前所未有的嚴峻時期，我們相信開放、穩定、透明、包容、可預測和以規則為本的國際貿易環境較以往任何時候都更為重要，特別是對發展中經濟體而言，不但能助它們生存，更可讓它們乘着新興機遇蓬勃發展。」

丘應樺表示，亞太經合組織本身亦積極應對影響亞太區的議題，包括加強供應鏈的韌性以抵禦衝擊和威脅。作為外向型經濟體，無縫且有效的供應鏈對香港至關重要。

他續指，香港在這方面善用技術創新，例如應用人工智能以便利海關執法、貨物清關和航空合作夥伴配對。香港亦正積極與東南亞國家聯盟等主要貿易夥伴的貿易單一窗口建立連接。

在部長級會議期間，丘應樺分別與國家商務部副部長兼國際貿易談判副代表凌激、韓國產業通商資源部通商事務次官補樸鍾元、秘魯外貿和旅遊部長Teresa Stella Mera Gómez、新西蘭貿易及投資部長Todd McClay和印尼貿易部部長Budi Santoso會面，就雙方關注的議題交換意見。

丘應樺明日（十月三十一日）返港。"

大家好。今日我很高興能夠參與港台「十五運會、殘特奧會」啟動禮。今屆全運會香港賽區第一個競賽項目沙灘排球，將率先於明日在維多利亞公園展開。今日正好能夠與大家一起倒數，迎接全城熱切期待的全運會，為香港健兒打氣。

今屆全運會意義非凡，是首次由廣東、香港、澳門三地共同舉辦，不但是粵港澳大灣區合作與融合的一個重要里程碑，更是突破邊界的創新實踐。以十一月八日的跨境公路單車賽為例，全國健兒將會穿越香港、珠海、澳門三地比拼，除了體現香港統籌賽事與跨境協作的能力，也展示大灣區一小時生活圈的互聯互通優勢，推動大灣區體育產業聯動發展。

香港在今屆全運會承辦八個競賽項目，不但為我們帶來寶貴的大型賽事經驗，更有利香港健兒把握主場之利衝擊獎牌，鞏固本港的體育發展。此外，全運會為全國最高水平的運動會，除了吸引大批旅客前來香港欣賞賽事，亦帶動香港市民在觀賞賽事之餘外出消費，有助帶旺場館周邊地區的餐飲、零售等。我們期望透過今次機會，展現香港多元化的城市形象，宣傳香港盛事之都的品牌，讓舉國及世界看到香港的活力與魅力。

為讓香港市民能全方位觀賞賽事感受全運會氣氛，繼去年圓滿直擊巴黎奧運會及殘奧會賽事之後，港台已做好準備，直播國家級體育盛事。我知道港台同事早在一年多前已經展開全方位的策劃，無論是賽前專題、運動員備戰，還是轉播技術與新媒體內容等等都做足準備。

全運會期間，港台電視32及港台電視36將會廣泛播放不同賽事，而為了推動共融全運，港台的全運會賽事直播將提供粵語、普通話旁述、口述影像及手語服務，務求讓每一位香港市民能切身感受國家體育盛事及運動魅力。我深信港台團隊將發揮一貫的專業精神和高水準製作，向大眾宣揚國家高水平的競技運動。

我亦藉此為香港運動員打氣，祝願他們再創佳績，亦預祝十五運會、殘特奧會圓滿成功！最後，大家記得除了支持全運會和香港運動員之餘，亦要記得十二月七日立法會選舉的大日子，積極履行公民責任投下你手中重要的一票。大家亦可鼓勵你的家人和朋友踴躍投票，選出為香港繁榮穩定作出貢獻的立法會議員。十二月七日，投入選舉，共創未來！多謝各位。"
Speech by SJ at High-Level Forum on Generative AI Governance and Cultural Co-Creation (English only),2025-10-30 16:42,2025-10-30 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000608.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the High-Level Forum on Generative AI (Gen AI) Governance and Cultural Co-Creation today (October 30):

Provost Professor Guo (Provost of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Professor Guo Yike), Professor Song (Director, Media Intelligence Research Center of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Professor Celine Song), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, 

 A very good afternoon. It is a great pleasure to address this assembly of distinguished scholars and industry leaders and kick off the panel discussion on ""Credibility and Accountability in the Era of Generative AI"".

 The choice of topic is most timely as the Chief Executive just announced last month in this year's Policy Address that the Department of Justice will form an interdepartmental working group to co-ordinate the responsible bureaux to review the legislation needed to complement the wider application of artificial intelligence. This raises an important question: why is there an imminent need for such a review of legislation?

 While providing convenience and enhancing efficiency, AI, as we all know, is also open to abuse and sometimes, even with the best of intentions, may be misused. Here comes the question of credibility and accountability.

 Currently, Hong Kong has no bespoke legislation governing AI. To harness the potential benefits this new technology may bring, it is incumbent upon the Government to take the lead in reviewing the relevant law so as to provide a facilitative yet properly controlled legal environment for AI's development. This is not easy as it requires us to strike a balance, even if it is going to be a fine balance, between the need to encourage and promote innovation and technology development on the one hand, and that to ensure credibility and accountability in the use of AI on the other hand. This balancing exercise is highly relevant to the rule of law. Let me explain why.

 There are many attempts to identify and articulate what should be regarded as the core or fundamental principles of the rule of law. This is how I would encapsulate the concept: there must be the existence of laws and regulations which can be enforced effectively to govern human activities so as to ensure that such activities will be conducted in a fair and proper manner, without causing any harm to or prejudicing the rights of others. To uphold this principle, it is essential for our legal framework to evolve in a timely manner to protect the legitimate rights and interests of different stakeholders affected by the use of AI.

 I now wish to underscore five issues which are non-exhaustive concerning the credibility and accountability in relation to the use of AI.

 First, AI-generated content depends on the dataset on which the AI tool is trained and the information uploaded to it to obtain a response. A reliable dataset and machine learning may involve the use of copyrighted materials. This raises questions on whether the current copyright law can tackle new issues involving the relative rights and liabilities among copyright owners, generative AI providers and its users, such as the use of copyrighted materials without authorisation and ownership of AI-generated work.

 Second, as the saying goes, ""Garbage in, garbage out."" Sometimes, AI may generate false or inaccurate content due to the incomplete or flawed information uploaded. Recently, the High Court of England and Wales has also warned that GenAI can produce apparently coherent and plausible but in fact entirely incorrect responses to prompts, make confident but untrue assertions, cite sources that do not exist.

 Third, deepfakes generated by AI may present substantial risks by producing highly realistic but in fact fake audio and visual content. The complaint against a law student using AI to create over 700 pornographic female images is telling. The implication is that, among other things, in any process of evidence-based inquiries, what appears to be very compelling may in fact be fabricated.

 Fourth, Professor Cecilia Chan, an education academic, has recently said that the rapid advancement of GenAI presents a serious threat to higher education, particularly with the emergence of the so-called ""AI-giarism"", i.e. the misuse of AI tools by students and researchers to present AI-generated work as their own. In the long run, it may risk eroding an individual's critical thinking skills in reasoning through the questioning of assumptions and the evaluation of information before reaching independent judgement.

 Fifth, UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) expresses concern that AI may pose risks to children as it can instantly create persuasive disinformation, as well as harmful and illegal content. AI may also influence children's perceptions and attributions of intelligence, cognitive development, and social behaviour as it blurs the line between animate and inanimate, given the human-like tone of chatbots. Even for mature and seasoned decision-makers, reliance on AI may risk systemic discrimination which reinforces existing biases or even amplify inequalities, prejudices and stereotyping.

 The Government has already been putting in much effort to tackle these issues. On the intellectual property front, the Government is introducing, among other things, a new ""text and data mining exception"" in the Copyright Ordinance (Cap 528), which would allow copyright users to make copies of copyright works for computational data analysis and processing, without a licence from copyright owners.

 We also see over time the issuance of guidelines from different quarters. Examples include ""Guidelines on the Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Judges and Judicial Officers and Support Staff of the Hong Kong Judiciary"", ""Hong Kong Generative Artificial Intelligence Technical and Application Guideline"" issued by the Government's Digital Policy Office and those from local universities.

 While these guidelines are flexible and sector-specific, they do not have the force of law. Whether they are sufficient and effective to address the above-mentioned issues is yet to be seen and requires further study. In any event, proper co-ordination and overall supervision may well be required to prevent and reconcile possible inconsistent or even conflicting measures on the same or similar issues.

What is happening elsewhere?

  On the Chinese Mainland, the ""Interim Measures for the Administration of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services"", jointly issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China and other authorities, took effect in August 2023. GenAI service providers must now, for example, take effective measures to make GenAI services more transparent and AI-generated content more accurate and reliable, protect users' inputted information and use records, and label AI-generated content. Service providers will be punished by the supervising authorities for violation after inspection. Under a departmental regulatory document effective in September 2025, service providers who provide text generation or editing services conducted through simulation of natural persons, etc, shall add explicit labels to AI-generated or synthesised content.

 The European Artificial Intelligence Act, binding and directly applicable in all EU (European Union) member states, commenced in August 2024, with its requirements applying incrementally. Certain requirements on credibility and accountability will start on August 2 next year and providers of GenAI systems shall ensure that systems' outputs are marked in a machine-readable format and detectable as AI-generated or manipulated. Subject to some exceptions, deployers of an AI system that generates or manipulates content constituting a deepfake, shall disclose that the content has been artificially generated or manipulated.

 Most recently, in Italy, Law No. 132/2025 just took effect on October 10, 2025. This is the first domestic law in the European Union on the use of AI. The fundamental principles underpinning the legal framework governing the use of AI in different sectors, including healthcare, employment, professional services, and intellectual property, are transparency, proportionality, security, protection of data, accountability, gender equality and non-discrimination. That Law also seeks to combat crimes committed with AI support. The unlawful dissemination of AI-generated or altered content e.g. deepfake is a standalone offence, whereas market manipulation offences committed through AI are subject to increased penalties. To protect minors, children under the age of 14 may use AI only with their parents' consent.

 For us, Hong Kong must of course design its own approach based on its own circumstances. This requires collective wisdom from all sectors. With this in mind, the Government will engage with all relevant stakeholders to build a legal framework to promote AI in a way which is reasonably flexible to cater for its fast development and wide application, but without compromising the rule of law.

 That's why as I have mentioned over lunch during my discussion with Professor Song, I am very excited at the establishment of the new centre. One of the focuses of the centre concerns AI governance and I certainly look forward to more collaborations between the Department of Justice, or perhaps the HKSAR Government as a whole, and the centre and, of course, the university. Indeed, more stakeholders will share common interest in this very important area.

 Before I conclude, I would like to take the opportunity to mention another very important thing. I would like to invite you to exercise your right to vote in the upcoming Legislative Council General Election on December 7. Your active participation is not merely an exercise of an extremely valuable and important constitutional right. Your active participation will also make a very impactful decision on the future well-being of our society. On this note, I wish you a fruitful, meaningful and enjoyable discussion and exchanges this afternoon.

 Thank you very much."

Professor Lo said, ""Like many other countries and regions, Hong Kong is confronted with the threats arising from an ageing population and NCDs. In 2024, over half (53 per cent) of all registered deaths in Hong Kong were caused by NCDs, including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and chronic respiratory diseases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 80 per cent of all premature NCD deaths can be prevented through management of risk factors and adherence to a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, prevention as well as early detection and proper treatment are the most cost-effective long-term strategies in reducing the burden of NCDs.""

During the meeting, members examined the progress of the nine local targets in the prevention and control of NCDs. Professor Lo emphasised, ""Through the collaborative efforts of various parties, the risk of premature mortality from four major NCDs in Hong Kong has declined continuously, with a reduction of over 25 per cent when compared to 15 years ago, indicating that we have achieved certain results in this regard. Also, the smoking prevalence rate in Hong Kong has reduced significantly from 23.3 per cent in 1982 to a historical low of 9.1 per cent in 2023. However, other risk factors for developing NCDs like obesity and insufficient physical activity are still common. As such, the Chief Executive announced in his 2024 and 2025 Policy Address respectively that the Government would devise health promotion strategies by adopting a life-course framework and weight management action plan, with a view to raising public health awareness and practices through strengthening health education and promotion, cultivating a supportive environment in the community, strengthening health service delivery, and more.""

The Department of Health (DH) has set up a task force to devise health promotion strategies by adopting a life-course framework. During the meeting, the task force briefed members on the latest local epidemiological data and scientific evidence, as well as priority areas and necessary health promotion measures for different age groups formulated by making reference to the WHO's latest recommendations and using an evidence-based approach, covering various stages including infancy, entering school, adulthood, employment, as well as pre- and post-pregnancy, and transition to older age. Furthermore, within the context of health and medical innovation development, the strategies also include the use of innovative technologies to enhance public health in a comprehensive, systematic, and efficient manner.

The Government has been actively establishing a prevention-oriented primary healthcare system according to the reform measures set out in the Primary Healthcare Blueprint. The Health Bureau (HHB) launched the three-year Chronic Disease Co-Care (CDCC) Pilot Scheme in 2023. Under a co-payment model, participants can receive hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidaemia screenings in the private healthcare sector for early treatment and long-term health management. According to the 2025 Policy Address, the HHB will gradually develop the CDCC Pilot Scheme into the CDCC Platform to integrate primary healthcare resources and gradually extend it to cover more types of chronic diseases. More health empowerment elements and preventive care programmes will also be added to establish a more systematic and coherent integrated primary healthcare platform in the community.

Members also received a briefing on the new phase of tobacco control measures in Hong Kong to further alleviate the threat posed by tobacco to public health through a multipronged tobacco control strategy, namely, Regulate Supply, Suppress Demand; Ban Promotion, Reduce Attractiveness; Expand No Smoking Areas, Mitigate Harm; and Enhance Education, Support Cessation. Smoking is the most important but preventable risk factor leading to death and disease. Members unanimously agreed with the Government's comprehensive tobacco control strategy, which aims to further reduce the smoking prevalence in Hong Kong and minimise the impact of secondhand smoke on citizens, thereby preventing the heavy price imposed on the whole society and the healthcare system by smoking-induced diseases.

To ensure effective surveillance of NCDs in Hong Kong to support the formulation of public health policies, the DH commenced the fourth territory-wide Population Health Survey (PHS) last month to collect pertinent information on the health status and lifestyles of the local population, with a view to updating and enriching the Government's database on population health. Findings from the PHS will facilitate the review of the various targets under the Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent and Control NCDs in Hong Kong."
一名入境旅客管有未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-10-30 16:05,2025-10-30 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000585.htm,"一名入境旅客因管有未完稅香煙和未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（十月三十日）在粉嶺裁判法院被判處監禁兩個月零十日及罰款二千元。

海關人員於十月二十四日在落馬洲支線管制站截查一名四十一歲抵港男旅客，並在其身上及個人行李內檢獲六百二十支未完稅香煙，估計市值約三千元，應課稅值約二千元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"

Customs officers intercepted a 41-year-old incoming male passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on October 24 and seized 620 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $3,000 and a duty potential of about $2,000 found on him and from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence imposes a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

《基層醫療健康藍圖》建議加強社區藥房角色，及發展社區藥房服務。二○二四年《施政報告》公布制訂社區藥物名冊及推出社區藥房計劃。有關政策包括制訂相關基層醫療社區藥房服務準則，以為社區藥房計劃定下參考要求。

社區藥物名冊運作機制

按照社區藥物名冊的運作機制，名冊所列藥物將主要從醫院管理局（醫管局）藥物名冊中選取，並透過政府與醫管局所建立的協作機制，由醫管局統籌採購。有關機制利用醫管局完善的藥物評估及入藥機制、嚴謹的採購標準和龐大的採購規模，不但可確保社區藥物名冊的藥物均屬安全、具療效及質量保證，更可通過共同採購降低成本。

社區藥物名冊將涵蓋基層醫療常用藥物，包括預防性藥物、慢性疾病管理藥物（如糖尿病及高血壓藥物）及治療偶發性疾病所需藥物。名冊設有三個層級類別，各層級藥物的納入機制、使用範圍及共付模式將有所不同。第一層以非專利藥物為主，第二層涵蓋個別專利藥物及指定藥物類別，第三層則為特別藥物類別。

社區藥物名冊的藥物應用將於明年下半年有序推行，屆時參與政府基層醫療健康計劃（如「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」））的市民，可透過計劃內的醫生（家庭醫生）或參與社區藥房計劃的社區藥房，根據醫生處方，按共付模式獲配發名冊內的基層醫療藥物。

基層醫療署現正建立社區藥物名冊的藥物名單，並經醫管局與藥物供應商確立採購協議和相關資訊系統的籌備工作。名冊推出初期，將以｢慢病共治計劃｣的藥物名單為基礎，涵蓋超過100項藥物，並會根據病人的需要逐步擴展，長遠可望涵蓋多達200至400項藥物。政府會不時審視名冊的藥物名單，為未來納入新藥預留彈性，以配合社會需要。

《基層醫療社區藥房指引》

為配合將推行的社區藥房計劃，基層醫療署推出《基層醫療社區藥房指引》，制訂清晰的標準，並建立服務框架，推動社區藥房及其藥劑師在醫療體系中發揮更關鍵的角色，提升專業水平及服務質素，確保市民能夠獲得一致、優質和安全的護理服務。

《指引》涵蓋社區藥房四大範疇：（一）運作及管理人員標準；（二）處所要求；（三）日常運作程序，以及（四）服務範疇，系統性地說明社區藥房在現行法例和監管框架下的營運模式及提供服務的實務準則。《指引》附錄載有評估核對表，讓社區藥房檢視其營運，以推動服務質素的持續改善。

《指引》會作為社區藥房計劃的標準基礎。長遠而言，經政府審核符合《指引》訂明的服務標準及品質保證要求的註冊藥房，方可成為基層醫療服務網絡下之認可社區藥房。《指引》會率先於地區康健中心網絡的社區藥房服務點執行。基層醫療署將密切留意基層醫療及社區藥房發展的需要，持續與社區藥房工作小組、社區藥房諮詢小組及指引制定工作小組保持緊密溝通，並會定期更新《指引》內容供業界參考。

社區藥物名冊的運作機制及《指引》全文，請參閱基層醫療署網站。

社區藥房計劃

基層醫療署將於明年第四季起分階段推行社區藥房計劃。計劃設有「社區」及「院舍」兩種服務模式。在社區藥房計劃（社區），符合參與藥物重配服務的醫管局家庭醫學門診病人在下次覆診前，會由參與計劃的社區藥房分期配發指定藥物，以加強病人準確用藥，避免貯存過量藥物，從而減低風險和可能造成的浪費。而參與基層醫療健康計劃，例如「慢病共治計劃」的病人，亦可選擇在社區藥房計劃內的社區藥房領取藥物，為病人提供除家庭醫生診所外另一便捷取藥途徑及用藥指導服務。

社區藥房計劃（院舍）則為居住在安老及殘疾院舍的醫管局病人定期配發醫管局處方藥物，改善目前院舍由職員每日整理及分發藥物的情況，以加強病人準確用藥及減低過量貯存藥物的風險。社區藥房計劃（院舍）服務內容涵蓋藥物配發、整合及預先包裝每日所需藥物。此外，藥劑師亦會協助院舍運用資訊科技進行藥物管理，以提升院舍用藥的安全性。

Primary Healthcare Commission announces Community Drug Formulary mechanism and Guidelines of Practice for Community Pharmacy to pave way for launch of Community Pharmacy Programme next year (with photo),2025-10-30 16:02,2025-10-30 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000223.htm,"The Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) announced the Community Drug Formulary (CDF) mechanism and promulgated the Guidelines of Practice for Community Pharmacy (Guidelines) today (October 30) to establish a clear framework for the services of community pharmacies and their pharmacists, with a view to paving the way for the launch of the Community Pharmacy Programme (CPP). The CPP is expected to be launched in the fourth quarter of next year, offering more convenience for citizens to obtain affordable primary healthcare drugs and professional community pharmacy services.

The Primary Healthcare Blueprint recommended to enhance the role of community pharmacies and to develop community pharmacy services. The 2024 Policy Address announced the development of a CDF and the launch of a CPP, including the formulation of relevant practice guidelines for community pharmacies in primary healthcare, setting reference requirements for the CPP.

Community Drug Formulary mechanism

According to the mechanism of the CDF, drugs listed therein will be mainly selected from the Hospital Authority (HA) Drug Formulary. The HA will co-ordinate the procurement through a collaborative mechanism established between the Government and the HA. Leveraging the HA's comprehensive drug assessment and inclusion mechanism, stringent procurement standards and large-scale procurements, the relevant mechanism not only can ensure that all drugs listed in the CDF are safe, efficacious and of quality, but also can achieve cost reductions through joint procurement.

The CDF will cover drugs commonly used in primary healthcare, including preventive drugs, drugs for managing chronic diseases (such as drugs for diabetes and hypertension), and drugs for treating episodic illnesses. The CDF will be classified into three tiers, each with different drug inclusion mechanisms, scope of applications, as well as co-payment models. Tier 1 will mainly comprise non-patented drugs; Tier 2 will cover individual patented drugs and specified drugs; and Tier 3 will consist of drugs classified as special category.

The drug application of the CDF will be launched in the second half of next year in an orderly manner. By then, citizens participating in the Government's primary healthcare programmes, such as the Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme (CDCC Pilot Scheme), can be provided with primary healthcare drugs listed in the CDF with doctors' prescriptions under a co-payment model through doctors under the programmes (family doctors) or community pharmacies participating in the CPP.

The PHC Commission is currently formulating the CDF drug list, and establishing procurement agreements with drug suppliers and pressing ahead with the preparatory work of relevant information systems through the HA. The CDF will be based on the drug list of the CDCC Pilot Scheme and cover over 100 drug items upon its launch. It will be gradually expanded based on patient needs, with the long-term scope of covering up to 200 to 400 drug items. The Government will review the drug list in a timely manner and allow flexibility to include new drugs in the future to meet the needs of the society.

Guidelines of Practice for Community Pharmacy

To pave way for the upcoming CPP, the PHC Commission promulgated the Guidelines to devise clear standards and to establish a service framework, with a view to promoting community pharmacies and their pharmacists to play a more crucial role in the healthcare system, enhancing professional standards and service quality, and ensuring members of the public can receive consistent, high-quality and safe care services.

The Guidelines cover four key areas of community pharmacies: (1) standards for management and staff involved in the operation; (2) requirements for the premises; (3) daily operation procedures; and (4) scope of services. The Guidelines stipulate the operation models and practical guidance of service provisions of a community pharmacy under the existing legal and regulatory framework in a systemic manner. The appendix of the Guidelines includes an assessment checklist for community pharmacies to review their operations, thereby promoting continuous improvement in service quality.

The Guidelines will serve as the fundamental standard for the CPP. In the long term, only registered pharmacies that have been vetted by the Government as meeting the service standards and quality assurance requirements outlined in the Guidelines will be recognised as community pharmacies under the primary healthcare service network. The Guidelines will initially apply to community pharmacies participating as service outlets in the District Health Centre network. The PHC Commission will closely monitor the needs for the development of primary healthcare and community pharmacies, maintaining close communication with the Working Group on Community Pharmacy, the Advisory Group on Community Pharmacy and the Task Group on Guideline Formulation, and regularly update the content of the Guidelines for industry reference.

For the Community Drug Formulary mechanism and the full text of the Guidelines, please refer to the PHC Commission website.

Community Pharmacy Programme

The PHC Commission will launch the CPP in phases starting from the fourth quarter of next year. The CPP will adopt two service models, namely the Community and the Residential Care Homes (RCH). Under the CPP (Community), participating community pharmacies will dispense designated drugs in batches to patients of the HA's Family Medicine Out-patient Services eligible for drug dispensing services before their next follow-up consultation with a view to enhancing patients' drug compliance and avoiding excess storage of drugs, thereby reducing risks and potential wastage. As for patients enrolled in primary healthcare programmes, such as the CDCC Pilot Scheme, they may also opt to obtain drugs from community pharmacies under the CPP, offering them a convenient alternative for obtaining drugs and medication counselling services other than their family doctors' clinics.

Under the CPP (RCH), HA-prescribed drugs will be regularly dispensed to HA patients residing in RCHs for the elderly and persons with disabilities to improve the current practice of daily drug sorting and distribution by RCH staff, with a view to enhancing patients' drug compliance and reducing the risks associated with overstocking of drugs. The services of the CPP (RCH) include drug distribution, reconciling, and prepackaging of the daily required drugs. In addition, pharmacists will assist RCHs in adopting information technology for drug management to enhance drug safety in RCHs.

Pharmacies participating in the CPP will also provide a range of professional value-added pharmaceutical services according to the actual needs of patients and RCHs. Apart from general drug consultations and counselling, drug reconciliation and drug safety information, pharmacies under the CPP (Community) also provide services such as drug management, chronic disease management, smoking cessation and oral health promotions. As for the CPP (RCH), value-added services include establishment of drug administration systems, drug management and storage for RCHs, health education and staff training, thereby ensuring safe and accurate drug administration, as well as enhancing management of drug safety in RCHs.

The first-stage tender exercise for the CPP (Community) will commence in the fourth quarter of this year, with phased implementation starting from the fourth quarter of next year. In the initial phase, the CPP (Community) will be piloted at four districts, each with approximately four to five community pharmacies, and will be extended to cover all 18 districts across the city by the fourth quarter of 2027. Meanwhile, the first-stage tender exercise for the CPP (RCH) is expected to commence in the first quarter of next year, with phased implementation beginning in the first quarter of 2027."

Under the CPP (RCH), HA-prescribed drugs will be regularly dispensed to HA patients residing in RCHs for the elderly and persons with disabilities to improve the current practice of daily drug sorting and distribution by RCH staff, with a view to enhancing patients' drug compliance and reducing the risks associated with overstocking of drugs. The services of the CPP (RCH) include drug distribution, reconciling, and prepackaging of the daily required drugs. In addition, pharmacists will assist RCHs in adopting information technology for drug management to enhance drug safety in RCHs.

Pharmacies participating in the CPP will also provide a range of professional value-added pharmaceutical services according to the actual needs of patients and RCHs. Apart from general drug consultations and counselling, drug reconciliation and drug safety information, pharmacies under the CPP (Community) also provide services such as drug management, chronic disease management, smoking cessation and oral health promotions. As for the CPP (RCH), value-added services include establishment of drug administration systems, drug management and storage for RCHs, health education and staff training, thereby ensuring safe and accurate drug administration, as well as enhancing management of drug safety in RCHs.

The first-stage tender exercise for the CPP (Community) will commence in the fourth quarter of this year, with phased implementation starting from the fourth quarter of next year. In the initial phase, the CPP (Community) will be piloted at four districts, each with approximately four to five community pharmacies, and will be extended to cover all 18 districts across the city by the fourth quarter of 2027. Meanwhile, the first-stage tender exercise for the CPP (RCH) is expected to commence in the first quarter of next year, with phased implementation beginning in the first quarter of 2027."

醫務衞生局局長主持防控非傳染病督導委員會第十六次會議（附圖）,2025-10-30 15:33,2025-10-30 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000260.htm,"醫務衞生局（醫衞局）局長盧寵茂教授今日（十月三十日）主持防控非傳染病督導委員會第十六次會議，討論應對非傳染病的策略及措施。

盧寵茂教授說︰「香港與許多其他國家和地區一樣，正面對人口高齡化和非傳染病日益嚴重所帶來的威脅。在二○二四年，本港登記死亡病因超過一半（53%）屬非傳染病，包括癌症、心血管疾病、糖尿病和慢性呼吸系統疾病。世界衞生組織（世衞）指出，八成因非傳染病引致的早逝個案可透過控制風險因素及實踐健康生活習慣來預防。因此，預防、及早發現並妥善治療是減輕非傳染病負擔最具成本效益的長期策略。」

會議上，委員檢視了本地九項防控非傳染病目標的進度。盧寵茂教授強調︰「透過各方協作，本港因四大非傳染病而導致的早逝風險持續下降，與十五年前相比減少了超過25%，顯示我們在這方面已取得一定成效。此外，本港吸煙率亦由一九八二年的23.3%大幅下降至二○二三年9.1%的歷史新低。然而，引致非傳染病的其他風險因素如肥胖和缺乏體能活動仍然普遍。就此，行政長官在去年和今年的《施政報告》分別宣布，政府將制訂全生命周期健康促進策略和體重管理行動計劃，以透過加強健康教育推廣、營造有利的社會環境、強化醫療機構治療方案等措施來提升市民的健康意識和實踐。」

衞生署已成立專責小組制訂全生命周期健康促進策略。會議上，專責小組向委員闡述本地最新流行病學數據和科學證據，並參考世衞的最新建議，以實證為本的方式為各年齡層制訂優先領域和所需健康促進措施，涵蓋嬰兒期、入學、成年、就業，以及懷孕前後和步入老年的各個階段。此外，在醫療創新發展的脈絡下，該策略亦涵蓋運用創新科技，全面、系統化及有效地提升公眾健康。

政府正致力按照《基層醫療健康藍圖》所提出的改革措施，積極建立以預防為重的基層醫療體系。醫衞局於二○二三年推出為期三年的「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」），參加者在共付模式下，可在私營醫療界別接受高血壓、糖尿病和高血脂篩查，以及早接受治理及作長期的健康管理。根據二○二五年《施政報告》，醫衞局會逐步將「慢病共治計劃」發展成為「慢性疾病共同治理平台」，以整合基層醫療服務資源，逐步覆蓋更多慢性疾病，並加入更多健康賦能的元素和預防性護理項目，建立一個更有系統和連貫性的社區基層醫療綜合平台。

委員亦聽取有關本港新一階段控煙措施，務求通過多管齊下的控煙策略，包括「管供應、降需求」、「禁宣傳、減引誘」、「擴禁區、免煙害」及「重教育、助戒煙」，進一步減輕煙草對公眾健康的威脅。吸煙是導致死亡及疾病中最重要但可預防的風險因素。委員均認同政府採取的全面控煙策略，進一步降低本港吸煙率和減少二手煙對市民的影響，從而避免整體社會和醫療系統因吸煙而帶來的疾病付出沉重代價。

為有效監測非傳染病在本港的情況，以協助制訂公共衞生政策，衞生署於上月開展第四次全港人口健康調查，收集本地人口的健康狀況和生活習慣等資料，以更新和豐富政府的人口健康資料庫。調查結果將協助審視《香港非傳染病防控策略及行動計劃》訂立的各項目標。"

投資署署理署長李淑菁表示：「我們很高興協助MKS PAMP擴展香港業務，這個決定不但鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位，亦與政府積極推動香港成為國際黃金交易中心的工作相契合。MKS PAMP的擴展證明了香港是吸引全球企業拓展亞太區業務的據點。」

MKS PAMP行政總裁James Emmett表示：「香港是全球金融中心，擁有世界級的基礎設施，是我們擴展區內業務的必然之選。我們不但視香港作為進入中國內地黃金市場的重要門戶，亦是我們擴展亞太區貴金屬市場的核心據點。」

他補充：「我們十分重視香港特別行政區政府持續加強其作為國際黃金交易中心地位的各項舉措。這與我們的願景完全一致，因此香港是我們擴展區內和全球業務的策略夥伴。」

他進一步解釋，MKS PAMP正在擴大香港及亞太區的團隊，以配合該公司拓展區內業務的策略。香港總部將成為公司全方位提供貴金屬交易和金融服務的樞紐，主要負責區內銷售和客戶關係管理、貴金屬交易、財務管理和營運支援。

The inauguration was marked by a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by senior executives from MKS PAMP, representatives of InvestHK, and key stakeholders from the financial and precious metals sectors.
  
  MKS PAMP has maintained a substantial presence in Hong Kong for many years, with established offices and deep client relationships in the region. Building on this foundation, the inauguration of its new regional headquarters in the Central district represents an important expansion of the company's regional footprint. This strategic development elevates Hong Kong to the status of one of the company's three global trading hubs, alongside Geneva and New York. This provides seamless, round-the-clock coverage across all major time zones and assures the highest level of service to its regional clientele.
  
  Acting Director-General of Investment Promotion of InvestHK Ms Loretta Lee said, ""We are delighted to support MKS PAMP's expansion in Hong Kong. This decision not only reinforces the city's status as a leading international financial centre but also aligns with the Government's ongoing efforts to promote the city as an international hub for gold trading. MKS PAMP's expansion is a testament to Hong Kong's attractiveness as a destination for global businesses seeking to grow in the Asia-Pacific region.""
  
  The Chief Executive Officer of MKS PAMP, Mr James Emmett, said, ""Hong Kong's world-class infrastructure and established role as a global financial centre make it a natural choice for this expansion. We see Hong Kong not only as a vital link to the Chinese Mainland's gold market but also its position at the nexus of Asia Pacific's precious metals market.""
  
  He added, ""We value the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government's ongoing initiatives to strengthen its status as an international gold trading centre. This vision aligns seamlessly with our own, with Hong Kong consequently playing a strategic role in our regional and global aspirations.""
  
  He further explained, ""As part of its regional growth strategy, MKS PAMP is expanding its team in Hong Kong and across the Asia-Pacific region. The Hong Kong headquarters will serve as the regional hub for the company's comprehensive suite of precious metals trading and financial services. Core functions based here will include regional sales and client relationship management, precious metals trading, treasury activities, and operational support.""

商經局發言人表示，政府一直就「單一窗口」的發展與內地當局保持緊密聯繫，繼商經局今年五月與國家海關總署簽訂關於《「單一窗口」的合作安排》（《合作安排》），優化交流合作機制，是次專家小組會議重點討論兩地「單一窗口」的最新發展和落實進一步合作，並探討下階段深化合作的建議。

雙方亦探討在下一階段將「一單兩報」安排擴展至海運貿易文件的可行性，以省卻重新輸入數據的時間，進一步便利業界。

 A spokesman for the CEDB said that the Government has been maintaining close liaison with the Mainland authorities regarding the development of single windows. Further to the signing of the Cooperation Arrangement on Single Window between the CEDB and the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China in May this year to enhance the established exchange and co-operation mechanism, the Expert Group meeting focused on discussing the latest developments of the Single Windows of both sides and implementing further co-operation measures, while also exploring proposals for deepening collaboration in the next phase.

 As mentioned in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, Hong Kong will work with the Mainland to connect the Single Windows of the two places, and explore the feasibility of expanding the existing Mainland-Hong Kong cargoes ""Single Submission for Dual Declaration"" Scheme to cover other trade documents and transport modes. To this end, both sides confirmed at the meeting that the coverage of the Scheme will be extended progressively following the rollout of Hong Kong's Trade Single Window Phase 3 (starting from mid-2026), with road cargo manifests and import and export declarations to be covered in addition to the existing road advance cargo information, allowing more trade members to benefit from the convenience of completing customs declarations for both the Mainland and Hong Kong by making a single submission of road-mode trade documents.

 The two sides also explored the feasibility of expanding the Scheme to cover sea-mode trade documents in the next phase to reduce the time required for data re-entry, thereby further facilitating the trade.

 The spokesman added that the CEDB will continue to work closely with the Mainland authorities, including through regular Expert Group meetings, to take forward the interconnectivity of the Single Window systems of the two places."

The meeting brought together representatives from the Exit and Entry Administration of the People's Republic of China, the Macao Public Security Police Force, and the Macao Identification Services Bureau to exchange views on various immigration matters, including immigration management service arrangements for the 15th National Games of the People's Republic of China, travel document issuance, immigration clearance facilitation and talent mobility.

  Mr Kwok stated that the Immigration Department will strengthen collaboration with the Mainland and Macao counterparts to ensure the 15th National Games are held safely and smoothly. The Department will make advance immigration management service arrangements and deploy manpower as appropriate at control points to facilitate efficient immigration clearance for participating athletes, organisers and visitors travelling among the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao.

  The three sides agreed to continue close collaboration and deepen exchanges to safeguard national security and social stability and to support the successful hosting of the 15th National Games.

  At the meeting, the three authorities also discussed measures to further facilitate the travel of residents between the Mainland and the two Special Administrative Regions and to apply innovation and technology to enhance immigration services. Consensus was reached on various initiatives, including expanding the scope of talent endorsement policies, improving identification document processing and immigration clearance efficiency, and improving residency and service facilities arrangements. These aim to provide more convenient and efficient immigration services and to support Hong Kong and Macao in developing into international talent hubs.

  Since its launch in 2019 in Qingdao, Shandong Province, the ""1+2"" co-ordination mechanism has served as a key platform for co-operation in immigration management between the Mainland and the two Special Administrative Regions. Established under the leadership of the Exit and Entry Administration of the People's Republic of China with the participation from the Immigration Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Public Security Police Force and Identification Services Bureau of the Macao Special Administrative Region, the ""1+2"" co-ordination mechanism aims to enhance co-ordination and planning in immigration management across the three regions, facilitate smoother personnel exchanges, and better integrate Hong Kong and Macao into the national development strategy."

Thank you, Chair.

 I would like to first thank the Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for his insightful remarks.

  We gather at the time when the global trading landscape is undergoing profound transformation, driven by rapid technological advancements, escalating geopolitical tensions, rising protectionism, increasing fragmentation and other emerging issues like climate change. All these are reshaping the international trade order.

  In navigating this increasingly complex landscape, the multilateral trading system underpinned by the World Trade Organization (WTO) continues to play a pivotal role. The WTO, with its core principles of non-discrimination and co-operation as well as various critical roles and functions, has led the world trade to flourish for decades. In these unprecedented and challenging times, we believe that an open, stable, transparent, inclusive and predictable rules-based international trading environment is more crucial than ever, particularly for less developed economies, enabling them not just to survive but also to thrive on emerging opportunities.

 Notwithstanding the importance of the WTO, it is imperative that the WTO recalibrate its priorities and strategies to remain relevant. The WTO must update its rulebook, not only on substance but also in the way it works, to better meet the demands of today's global economy. Full-scale engagements are taking place to improve the WTO's functions, and we remain hopeful that these efforts will yield meaningful deliverables at the 14th Ministerial Conference scheduled for next March.

 While navigating reforms for the WTO amid the multilateral gridlock and geo-economic fragmentation, economies have resorted to plurilateral and regional activities. Plurilateral initiatives are a logical and realistic vehicle to make progress in the interim, particularly when it is increasingly difficult to achieve consensus across all WTO membership. That said, we should maintain the supremacy of the multilateral trading system in governing global trade, through leveraging APEC as the premier forum for multilateral engagement. As an incubator of innovative ideas, APEC has a unique role to play in fostering regional dialogue, contributing constructively to the ongoing WTO reform process and facilitating international co-operation.

 APEC itself has also been active in addressing issues that affect the region, such as enhancing the resilience of our supply chains against shocks and threats. Being an externally oriented economy, seamless and effective supply chains are essential to Hong Kong, China. Among other strategies, we have leveraged technological innovations, not least artificial intelligence, in this context. For instance, AI is applied to facilitate customs enforcement, cargo clearance and matchmaking for airline partnerships. We are also actively building connectivity on trade single window with key trading partners such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. We look forward to sharing our experiences with member economies, so that we can jointly enhance the resiliency and adaptability of the supply chains in the region.

 Hong Kong, China remains committed to working with member economies to overcome the challenges we face, whether they are short-term shocks or long-term structural shifts, so that we can achieve shared prosperity.

 Thank you."

  As one of the programme highlights of the 20th Eco Expo Asia, the symposium brings together government representatives, industry leaders, academics and professionals to foster professional dialogue, deepen partnerships, and promote Hong Kong's vision in sustainable development and the green economy.

  In his welcoming speech at the symposium, the President of the HKIQEP, Mr Freeman Cheung, said the HKIQEP firmly believes that technology and collaboration are the key driving forces of promoting sustainable development. A cleaner, wiser and more sustainable Hong Kong can be built by enhancing environmental assessment, advancing smart city development and leveraging the collaborative strengths of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).

  The Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui, officiated at the symposium. In his speech, he highlighted that this year's Policy Address sets out the Government's commitment to fostering a green and low-carbon living environment and promoting the commercialisation of green information and technology outcomes, thereby developing Hong Kong into a demonstration base for green technology. He further stressed that collaboration between public and private sectors, academia and professional organisations is crucial to achieving these goals.

  Dr Chui said, ""Our collaboration should transcend geographical constraints, actively leverage opportunities brought by the development of the GBA and the Belt and Road (B&R) Initiative, and share expertise in environmental protection and green solutions. Next year, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government will set up the B&R sustainable green development training centre to nurture talent in international environmental protection. The training centre will serve as a base for connecting the HKSAR with the global network for sustainable green development co-operation. The EPD is looking forward to working closely with the HKIQEP to contribute to regional and global sustainable development goals.""

  The symposium featured in-depth discussions on various important themes, including smart environmental assessment, biodiversity technology, green finance, and supply chain decarbonisation. Attendees unanimously agreed that cross-departmental collaboration and the integration of green innovative technology solutions are pivotal to achieving Hong Kong's climate action and sustainable development goals.

  At the symposium, the HKIQEP signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the GBA Eco-environmental Science Center and the Capacity-building Alliance of Sustainable Investment respectively, to deepen cross-regional co-operation and enhance professional capacities. Dr Chui witnessed the signing ceremony."

 Thank you, Chair.

 On behalf of the Hong Kong, China (HKC) delegation, let me begin by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to Korea for the warm hospitality and for hosting us in this historic and beautiful city of Gyeongju.

 The rapid development of digital technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), is fundamentally changing our societies at an unprecedented pace. To fully harness the benefits and smoothen the transformation process, HKC strongly supports deepening APEC's digital co-operation to foster economic growth and address common challenges. To this end, I would like to offer three suggestions.

 First, we must provide an enabling environment for digital innovation to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. This calls for strengthening infrastructure and adopting an application-oriented approach to promote deep integration of AI across the economy. HKC has been taking concrete actions. In terms of infrastructure, apart from the Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre established last year, we will develop an additional high-performing data facility cluster to provide advanced computing power for innovation. To promote AI adoption, we are attempting regulatory innovations like the AI sandbox for financial institutions, accelerating the digital transformation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and upgrading our trade architecture with AI. Our Government is also leading by example. As announced by our Chief Executive in his Policy Address last month, we are forming an AI Efficacy Enhancement Team to drive technological reform and modernise workflows across government agencies.

 Second, we must ensure that the benefits of digital advancement are shared across all sectors. With a people-centred approach, HKC is tackling key challenges such as digital divides and job displacements that are impeding an inclusive digital transition. Besides developing a strategic blueprint that will incorporate AI literacy into the core curriculum and enhance teacher training to ensure our next generation is future-ready, we are also reforming retraining programmes and strengthening re-employment support for our current workforce.

 Third, we should leverage APEC's unique role as an incubator of ideas to advance digital co-operation. Over the past decade, APEC has made significant strides in its digital agenda, from the APEC Internet and Digital Economy Roadmap to the APEC AI Initiative this year. We particularly commend Korea's leadership in mainstreaming AI across APEC's agenda, effectively connecting it to both traditional and emerging issues such as trade, demographic changes as well as cultural and creative industries. HKC is pleased to endorse these efforts and will continue to actively contribute to APEC's co-operation.

 In closing, HKC recognises AI as a key enabler to realise the APEC Putrajaya Vision 2040. We look forward to working together with fellow member economies to leverage digital co-operation and build a vibrant digital ecosystem across the Asia-Pacific region for the prosperity of our people and future generations. Thank you."
HKMoA receives artist Kong Kai-ming's donation of 100 watercolour paintings (with photos),2025-10-30 12:06,2025-10-30 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000266.htm,"The Hong Kong Museum of Art (HKMoA) has recently received another significant donation of Hong Kong art. Hong Kong's renowned artist Kong Kai-ming has generously donated 100 watercolour paintings of Hong Kong's natural scenery and geological features to the HKMoA's permanent collection, which demonstrate Kong's keen observation and portrayal of nature as well as his deep affection for Hong Kong. The Director of Leisure and Cultural Services, Ms Manda Chan, presented a certificate of appreciation to Kong on behalf of the department.

Born in 1932, Kong has been dedicated to artistic creation and art education for over 70 years. In addition to painting and teaching, he has released more than 60 art-related publications, making significant contributions to Hong Kong's art scene. Capturing Hong Kong's streets and scenery with detailed brushwork, his works document the changes in the city's urban landscape and natural beauty. As a home-grown Hong Kong artist, Kong gives himself a sense of responsibility to capture and convey Hong Kong's unique beauty through his art. Since several years ago, he has begun meticulously selecting his most cherished works for donation to the HKMoA as a heartfelt tribute to the city that he loves.

The paintings donated were completed between 2011 and 2023. In a realistic approach, Kong captures the stunning beauty of nature through rich compositions, varied perspectives, meticulous brushwork and vibrant colours, presenting the diverse shapes, textures and hues of mountains and rocks. With a soft brush, he masterfully portrays the hardness of stone, such as the twisted rock pillars of the High Island Reservoir and the extraordinary rock formation at the Bluff Head, bringing these scenes vividly to life. Some paintings, such as ""Port Island"", provide background information on the rock formation, adding geological significance beyond their artistic value.

In 2006, Kong was awarded the Bronze Bauhinia Star by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, recognising his outstanding contributions to art education.

Established in 1962, the HKMoA is the first public art museum in Hong Kong, dedicated to preserving and promoting local art. At present, the HKMoA is the custodian of an art collection of over 19 700 items, spanning historical eras from the Neolithic Age to contemporary times, representing the cultural significance and richness of artistic heritage from Hong Kong and beyond."

出生於一九三二年的江啟明，七十多年來一直醉心於藝術創作和美術教育，除了繪畫及教學外，更出版六十多本與美術相關書籍，對香港藝壇貢獻良多。他以細緻筆觸描繪香港街道與風景，更記錄了香港都市面貌及自然景色的變遷。作為香港土生土長的藝術家，江啟明自感有責任以藝術傳揚香港的獨特美景。數年前開始，他特意精心挑選他最滿意的作品以捐贈予香港藝術館，以藝術回饋他最愛的香港。

今次捐贈的畫作繪於二○一一至二○二三年間，江啟明以寫實風格記錄大自然的鬼斧神工，透過豐富的構圖、多變的視角、細緻的筆觸與絢麗的設色，呈現山石千變萬化的形狀、肌理和色澤。他以柔軟的毛筆表現堅硬的石塊，如《萬宜水庫被褶曲的岩牆》的扭曲石柱或《黃竹角咀之鬼手岩》的奇岩異石，在其筆下栩栩如生。部分畫作如《赤洲全貌》更註明岩石形成的背景資料，賦予畫作藝術價值以外的地質學歷史意義。

江啟明於二○○六年獲香港特別行政區政府頒授銅紫荊星章，表彰其在美術教育方面的卓越貢獻。

  First of all, I am happy to share with you that the National 15th Five-Year Plan has just confirmed the support for Hong Kong in building an international I&T (innovation and technology) centre. We are standing at the forefront of a global technological shift. AI is rapidly reshaping industries, economies and societies. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the global AI market is expected to reach about US$4.8 trillion by 2033, which is a 25-fold increase in 10 years from now. This remarkable growth underscores the urgent need for economies around the world to formulate and implement policies that balance the immense potential and the underlying risks of AI, ensuring its sustainable and inclusive development.

  The Government has spared no effort in promoting sound AI governance while fostering the advancement of industry. One of the cornerstones is the Ethical Artificial Intelligence Framework, first introduced in 2021, which covers 12 core principles from fairness and transparency to human oversight, implementation guidelines and risk assessment tools. The aim is to help organisations embed ethical considerations when implementing IT projects, ensuring that their AI systems are not only effective but also responsible. To keep up with the evolving AI landscape, the updated version introduced in 2023 further sharpened its relevance and recommended clearer practices to address emerging risks.

  Complementing our ethical framework is the Principles of Data Governance promulgated by the Government in 2024, which provide a foundational layer for reliable AI development. As data powers every stage of the life cycle of an AI system, from training to application, its quality, integrity and responsible use are essential. This Data Governance document promotes lawful sharing, privacy protection and accountability, helping organisations unlock the value of data in a responsible and ethical manner. This is crucial to our broader governance efforts.

  In view of the growing use of generative AI across sectors, the Government sees the merits in developing a practical framework for safe and responsible adoption that is tailored to Hong Kong's context with contribution from professionals. The Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center (HKGAI), under the leadership of Professor Guo Yike, was commissioned to put together the Hong Kong Generative Artificial Intelligence Technical and Application Guideline for release in April 2025. By leveraging the HKGAI's experience in building Hong Kong's first locally adapted large language model, the guideline provides clear, pragmatic and actionable advice for developers, service providers and users in the application of AI technology, covering key risks of data leakage, model bias and misinformation, and recommendations on safeguarding model training, deployment and content integrity.

  The Government also takes the lead in building a vibrant AI ecosystem by advancing the integration of AI into public services, recognising its potential to enhance efficiency, responsiveness and citizen experience. As announced in the 2025 Policy Address, a dedicated AI Efficacy Enhancement Team is set up to promote AI applications across government departments and explore process re-engineering to elevate public services. In parallel, the Digital Policy Office will roll out various AI applications in respect of data analysis, customer service and document processing.

  Alongside various initiatives to expand AI application scenarios in public services, the Government introduced the AI Adoption Guide for Government bureaux and departments earlier this year. It outlines strategies, practical guidelines and facilitation measures for AI adoption, with a strong emphasis on top-down leadership and a business-led ""AI+"" approach. It further encourages departments to identify operational challenges and explore the deployment of AI to enhance efficiency and improve service quality, serving as a catalyst for public service transformation.

  A thriving AI ecosystem counts not only on innovation and technology, but also strong and adaptive governance. Compliance across both public and private sectors is vital to protect data, uphold standards and build public trust. I appreciate the cross-sectoral effort in promoting responsible innovation and reliable AI governance.

  Before I close, I wish this forum every success, and look forward to witnessing Hong Kong's AI development scaling new heights. Thank you."
