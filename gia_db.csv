HKSAR Government strongly disapproves and rejects US report on human rights,2025-08-14 21:13,2025-08-14 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400965.htm,"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government today (August 14) strongly disapproves and rejects the unfounded and biased content related to Hong Kong contained in the United States (US) Department of State's so-called 2024 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.

A HKSAR Government spokesperson said, ""the HKSAR Government strongly disapproves and rejects the US' repeated tactics through the so-called report in making slandering remarks against Hong Kong, where 'one country, two systems' is successfully implemented. The US is once again overriding the rule of law with politics and politicising human rights issues. Such attempt to interfere in Hong Kong's law-based governance and undermine the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong is doomed to fail.""

""Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, human rights of Hong Kong residents have been firmly protected by the Constitution and the Basic Law. The HKSAR Government resolutely, fully and faithfully implement the Hong Kong National Security Law, the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance and other relevant laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, to effectively prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law, whilst maintaining the common law system, adhering to the principle of the rule of law and upholding the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents in accordance with the law, so as to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of the principle of 'one country, two systems'. The HKSAR Government strongly demands the US to immediately stop acting against international law and the basic norms of international relations and interfering in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs.""

On legislation safeguarding national security, the spokesperson pointed out, ""the content regarding legislation safeguarding national security in the HKSAR contained in the so-called report by the US are completely absurd and untrue. Since the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law in June 2020, the US has all along ignored the large-scale and incessant riots that occurred in 2019 which devastated the society, livelihood and economy of Hong Kong. Instead, it built up false stories and fabricated narratives through various so-called reports to maliciously slander legislation safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and blatantly attack the HKSAR in safeguarding national security dutifully, faithfully and in accordance with the law. The US has also deliberately neglected the fact that such laws have enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community, as well as the business environment, to return to normalcy. Its bullying conduct and hypocrisy laced with double standards are utterly despicable.""

""The legal framework in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR is consistent with the relevant international human rights standards. The Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security. The rights and freedoms, including the freedom of expression, press freedom, freedom of assembly and of association, freedom of academic research, literary and artistic creation and other cultural activities etc, enjoyed by Hong Kong residents under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to the HKSAR are to be protected in accordance with the law. In addition, the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance also clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security, including the principles of conviction and punishment only by the application of the law, the presumption of innocence, the prohibition of double jeopardy, and the right to defend oneself and other rights in judicial proceedings that a criminal suspect, defendant and other parties in judicial proceedings are entitled to under the law.""

""Like all other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. The enjoyment of these rights has limits so as not to affect adversely to an unacceptable level the enjoyment by other members of their community of their rights and liberties. Journalists, like everyone else, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. Their freedom of commenting on and criticising government policies remains uninhibited as long as they do not violate the law.""

""The offences endangering national security stipulated by the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance target acts endangering national security with precision, and define the elements and penalties of the offences with clarity. The prosecution has the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant has the actus reus and mens rea of an offence before the defendant may be convicted by the court. Moreover, the relevant offences do not have retrospective effect, which is in line with Article 12 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights.""

""As a matter of fact, each and every sovereign state enacts laws safeguarding national security. This is not only their inherent right, but also an international practice. The US has at least 21 pieces of laws safeguarding national security. It is therefore in no position to point its finger at other countries and regions for legitimately legislating to safeguard national security.""

""Reasonable and legitimate expression of opinion based on objective facts and legitimate day-to-day activities would not constitute an offence. Whether it be offences under the Hong Kong National Security Law or other offences endangering national security under the laws of the HKSAR, they only target an extremely small minority of organisations and individuals endangering national security.""

As for enforcement actions, the HKSAR Government's spokesperson reiterated that, ""the HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, and have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation.""

""Like law enforcement agencies around the world, the HKSAR's law enforcement agencies released information of fugitive offenders who are suspected to have committed serious offences and are wanted, and appealed for the public's assistance in bringing fugitive offenders to justice. This is legitimate, necessary, and squarely in line with international practice. The US often abuses 'long-arm jurisdiction' and unilateral sanctions to target citizens of other countries. Its smears on the HKSAR's enforcement actions taken in accordance with the law are simply untenable.""

""On bail arrangement, the cardinal importance of safeguarding national security and preventing and suppressing acts endangering national security explains why the Hong Kong National Security Law introduces more stringent conditions to the grant of bail in relation to offences endangering national security. Some jurisdictions have even put in place regimes that authorise prolonged detention on national security grounds without charge, depending on the specific circumstances of the case. The content against the implementation of the arrangement mentioned in the so-called report by the US are nothing but unreasonable smears.""

On safeguarding the due administration of justice and the rule of law, the HKSAR Government spokesperson reiterated that, ""Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law and has always adhered to the principle that laws must be obeyed and lawbreakers be held accountable. The HKSAR's judicial system is highly regarded by the international community. The HKSAR Judiciary exercises judicial power independently in accordance with the law, free from any interference. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to a fair hearing.""

In response to the false information in the so-called report by the US on the conditions of correctional services facilities, the HKSAR Government spokesperson said, ""the Correctional Services Department (CSD) is committed to providing a secure, safe, humane, decent and healthy custodial environment for persons in custody (PICs). The rights of PICs are safeguarded through a system of regular visits by independent visitors, namely Justices of the Peace (JPs), who are vested with the statutory duties to inspect the prisons once or twice every month. PICs may approach visiting JPs or lodge complaints through other channels including the CSD's Complaints Investigation Unit, the Ombudsman, etc. All complaints by PICs will be handled in an open, fair and just manner.""

""In the interests of a particular prisoner or for the maintenance of good order and discipline, the Commissioner of Correctional Services is empowered to make arrangements under section 68B of the Prison Rules that such prisoner should not associate with other prisoners (i.e. the so-called 'solitary confinement'). One of the purposes of the relevant arrangement is to ensure the personal safety and well-being of the PICs, which can be requested by the PICs themselves and approved by the Commissioner after considering the matter in accordance with the law; or the Commissioner may make such arrangements after considering the relevant factors in accordance with the legal requirements and procedures.""

Regarding the false information regarding deportation policy in the so-called report by the US, the HKSAR Government spokesperson said that, ""The HKSAR Government maintains a firm policy of not granting asylum and not determining or recognising refugee status of any person. A Unified Screening Mechanism (USM) has been put in place to screen non-refoulement claims on all applicable grounds in one go. The procedures of the USM meet the high standards of fairness as required by law and compare most favourably with those adopted in other common law jurisdictions. Each non-refoulement claimant is also provided with publicly-funded legal assistance.""

""At present, the Immigration Department (ImmD) can generally handle each new non-refoulement claim received instantly, and the Torture Claims Appeal Board has streamlined its processes to improve efficiency in handling appeal cases, with the appeal processing time drastically reduced to around four months. Moreover, the Judiciary has been proactively implementing a host of measures to ensure that non-refoulement claim related cases are handled as expeditiously as reasonably practicable, including increasing manpower to handle the growing number of cases, streamlining the relevant court procedures to enhance efficiency, etc.""

""Non-refoulement claimants have no lawful status to stay in Hong Kong. Regardless of the outcome of their non-refoulement claims, claimants are not permitted to remain legally in Hong Kong and they have no right to work in Hong Kong. In those circumstances where it is necessary to detain non-refoulement claimants in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions, legal principles established by the Court and the prevailing detention policy, they are provided with adequate facilities. The HKSAR Government also provides humanitarian assistance to them for sustaining their livelihood in Hong Kong. At present, Hong Kong has three detention facilities offering a total of 940 places for detaining non-refoulement claimants, which accounts for about 6 per cent of some 15 800 claimants. The said report which stated approximately 8 700 were held in immigration facilities is seriously inconsistent with the facts.""

Moreover, according to the HKSAR Government's updated removal policy, ImmD will proceed with the removal of unsubstantiated claimants from Hong Kong upon dismissal of their judicial review or relevant leave applications pertaining to their non-refoulement claims by the Court of First Instance (CFI) of the High Court, irrespective of whether there are outstanding court proceedings (including appeals lodged to the higher courts against the decisions of the CFI). The courts have also affirmed that the HKSAR Government's updated removal policy is lawful and reasonable.""

The HKSAR Government spokesperson reiterated that, ""the HKSAR steadfastly safeguards national sovereignty, security and development interests, and fully and faithfully lives up to this top priority of 'one country, two systems'. With the strong support from the motherland, and as the only city where the global advantage and the China advantage converge under 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong will continue to protect and promote human rights through security, development and co-operation, as well as to tell good stories of the HKSAR's human rights situation in a reasoned and robust manner."""
特區政府強烈不滿和反對美國人權報告,2025-08-14 21:12,2025-08-14 21:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400963.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（八月十四日）就美國國務院所謂二○二四年度人權報告中有關香港的不實和偏頗內容，表示強烈不滿和反對。

特區政府發言人表示：「特區政府強烈不滿和反對美國重施故技，通過所謂報告，肆意詆毀『一國兩制』成功實踐下的香港。美國一再以政治凌駕法治，將人權問題政治化，企圖干預香港依法施政、破壞香港繁榮穩定，注定以失敗告終。」

「自香港回歸祖國以來，香港居民的人權受《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實保障。特區政府堅定不移全面準確實施《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》及香港特區其他維護國家安全的相關法律，依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，同時維持普通法制度、堅持法治原則、依法保障香港居民的權利和自由，確保『一國兩制』實踐行穩致遠。特區政府強烈要求美國立即停止不符合國際法和國際關係基本準則的行為，立即停止干涉中國內政和香港事務。」

在維護國家安全相關法律方面，特區政府發言人指出：「美國所謂報告中針對香港特區維護國家安全相關法律的內容，全然無稽失實。自《香港國安法》在二○二○年六月實施以來，美國一直漠視香港在二○一九年發生的大型、持續、重創香港社會民生經濟、無日無之的暴亂，通過不同的所謂報告堆砌故事、穿鑿附會，惡意詆毀香港特區維護國家安全相關法律，對盡責、忠誠和依法維護國家安全的香港特區肆意攻擊，而對《香港國安法》讓廣大香港居民生活和經濟活動回復正常、營商環境恢復的實況置若罔聞，其霸凌和『雙標』的虛偽面目和行徑表露無遺。」

「香港特區維護國家安全的法律框架，與相關國際人權標準一致。《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》，均明確規定維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，亦依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》，以及《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港特區的有關規定下享有的權利和自由，包括發表自由、新聞自由、集會和結社自由的權利以及學術研究、文學藝術創作和其他文化活動的自由等。同時，《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》亦明確訂明，防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪時，應當堅持法治原則，包括罪刑法定、無罪推定、一事不再審等原則，並保障犯罪嫌疑人、被告人和其他訴訟參與人依法享有的辯護權和其他訴訟權利。」

「與世界其他地方一樣，有關權利和自由並非絕對。為使社會上其他人的權利和自由不會受到不可接受的影響，行使這些權利需要有限制。新聞從業員與其他人一樣都有義務遵守所有法律。只要不違法，傳媒評論及批評政府施政的自由並無受到限制。」

「《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》訂明的危害國家安全的罪行，精準針對危害國家安全的行為，清楚訂明構成有關罪行的元素和刑罰。控方有責任在毫無合理疑點下證明被告人有相關的犯罪行為和犯罪意圖，被告人才可被法庭定罪。此外，相關罪行不會有追溯力，符合《香港人權法案》第12條的規定。」

「事實上，每個主權國都會制定維護國家安全法律，這既是主權國家的固有權利，也是國際慣例。在維護國家安全方面的法律，美國就最少有21部，根本沒有資格對其他國家和地區就正當維護國家安全立法指手畫腳。」

「合理和正當地基於客觀事實發表的言論和正當的日常活動，不會構成罪行。不論是《香港國安法》下的罪行，抑或是香港特區法律下的其他危害國家安全罪行，都只是針對極少部分的危害國家安全的組織和個人。」

至於執法工作方面，特區政府發言人重申：「香港特區執法部門根據證據、嚴格依照法律，以及按有關個人或單位的行為採取所有執法行動，與政治立場、背景或職業無關。」

「與世界上其他執法部門一樣，香港特區執法部門公開因涉嫌犯下嚴重罪行而被通緝的逃犯資料，並要求市民大眾協助緝拿逃犯歸案，有關做法合法和實屬必要，亦符合國際慣例。美國經常對別國公民濫施『長臂管轄』、單邊制裁，其對香港特區依法進行執法行動的抹黑，根本站不住腳。」

「就保釋安排而言，維護國家安全，以及防範和制止危害國家安全的行為極為重要，此解釋了為何《香港國安法》對涉及危害國家安全的罪行引入更嚴格的保釋條件。有一些司法管轄區甚至設有機制，可以國家安全為由，因應案件的具體情況准許未經起訴而長時間拘留。美國所謂報告中針對有關安排實施的內容屬無理抹黑。」

在維護司法公正和法治精神方面，特區政府發言人重申：「香港是法治社會，一直秉持有法必依、違法必究的原則。香港特區司法制度深得國際社會推崇。香港特區司法機關依法獨立進行審判，不受任何干涉，而所有面對刑事指控的人都享有接受公平審訊的權利。」

就美國所謂報告中有關懲教院所情況的不實內容，特區政府發言人表示：「懲教署致力為在囚人士提供穩妥、安全、人道、合適和健康的羈管環境。獨立訪客（即太平紳士）定期巡視的安排確保在囚人士的權利獲得保障，太平紳士獲賦予每月巡視監獄一次或兩次的法定職責。在囚人士可向巡獄太平紳士或循其他途徑作出申訴，包括懲教署投訴調查組、申訴專員公署等。所有在囚人士作出的投訴都會獲公平、公開和公正的處理。」

「為某囚犯的利益或為維持秩序或紀律，懲教署署長根據《監獄規例》第68B條可作出有關囚犯不應與其他囚犯交往的安排（即所謂的『單獨監禁』）。有關安排的其中一個目的是保障囚犯的人身安全和福祉，可由該囚犯自行提出要求、由懲教署署長依法考慮後審批，或由懲教署署長根據法律規定及程序，在考量了相關的因素後而作出。」

就美國所謂報告中有關遣送政策的不實內容，特區政府發言人表示：「特區政府一貫採取堅定政策，不會給予任何人庇護，亦不會決定或確認任何人為難民。已實施的『統一審核機制』會一次過以所有適用的理由審核免遣返聲請。『統一審核機制』的程序符合法律要求的高度公平標準，並且與其他普通法司法管轄區相比更為完善。每位聲請人亦會獲得公費法律支援。」

「目前，入境處一般可即時處理接獲的免遣返聲請個案，而酷刑聲請上訴委員會亦已精簡程序，將處理上訴時間大幅減至約四個月。此外，司法機構一直積極採取多項措施以確保在合理可行的情況下，盡快處理與免遣返聲請有關的案件，包括增加人手處理與日俱增的個案，以及精簡相關法庭程序以提高效率等。」

「免遣返聲請人沒有合法身分在香港逗留。無論他們的免遣返聲請的結果如何，聲請人均不得在香港合法逗留，也沒有權利在香港工作。當有必要根據相關法例、法庭訂立的法律原則及現行的羈留政策羈留免遣返聲請人時，他們會獲提供足夠的設施。特區政府亦會向他們提供人道援助，以維持他們在香港的生計。目前，香港共有三個羈留設施提供合共940個可羈留免遣返聲請人的名額，佔約15 800多名聲請人的百分之六，該份所謂報告所述有8 700名免遣返聲請人被羈留的說法嚴重不符事實。」

「另外，根據特區政府的更新遣送政策，若聲請不獲確立者就其免遣返聲請提出的司法覆核或相關許可申請被高等法院原訟法庭拒絕，即使有尚待處理的法律訴訟程序（包括向更高級法院就原訟法庭的裁決提出的上訴），入境處可遣送相關聲請不獲確立者離港。法庭亦確立了特區政府更新遣送政策是合法和合理的。」

特區政府發言人重申：「香港特區堅決維護國家主權、安全和發展利益，全面準確貫徹『一國兩制』方針的最高原則。憑藉國家堅實支持，香港在『一國兩制』下作為世上唯一兼享全球優勢和中國優勢的城市，定必繼續以安全守護人權、以發展促進人權、以合作推進人權，有理有據、有力有節地講好香港特區人權故事。」"
文化體育及旅遊局局長出席音樂劇《大狀王》香港站開幕酒會的致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-08-14 20:18,2025-08-14 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400924.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（八月十四日）出席音樂劇《大狀王》香港站開幕酒會的致辭全文：

翟紹唐主席（西九文化區管理局（西九管理局）表演藝術委員會主席）、陳卓智主席（署理香港話劇團主席）、曾珮珊總裁（滙豐保險香港及澳門行政總裁）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家晚上好。今日我很開心主持音樂劇《大狀王》巡演香港站開幕儀式。大家很多時候都會在演藝文化表演項目中見到我，我亦很樂於出席各類型表演，但今日是我第一次有機會觀賞《大狀王》，因為《大狀王》之前兩度在香港演出均絕早爆滿，一票難求，我也買不到票。所以今次百聞不如一見，非常開心終於有機會入場，欣賞這一齣大家都期待已久其再重演的音樂劇。

我知道《大狀王》以廣東人熟悉的人物作起點，但亦加入西方音樂元素，糅合傳統當代、中西合璧的文化精粹，完美展現香港中外文化薈萃的特色定位。

國家《十四五規劃綱要》支持香港發展為中外文化藝術交流中心。因此，西九管理局積極響應去年《施政報告》政策，加強文化藝術創意項目輸出。由香港話劇團和西九聯合呈獻的《大狀王》是我今年六月到上海參與西九文化周期間的亮點活動，該次演出及其後在北京巡演時均大獲好評。加上今次在香港第三度上演，《大狀王》累計共有超過80場座無虛席的演出，成績絕對令人感到非常鼓舞﹗

連場精彩演出背後有賴香港話劇團和台前幕後成員努力付出。我衷心感謝他們以精益求精的精神，創作出《大狀王》這個膾炙人口的香港文化品牌。

我亦恭賀西九管理局獲得空前成功，期待未來你們有更多成功的本地作品，帶領香港走向世界舞台，在國際間說出美好的香港和中國故事。

謝謝大家。"

Home and Youth Affairs Bureau holds sharing session on district governance (with photos),2025-08-14 20:05,2025-08-14 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400873.htm,"âThe Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) held a sharing session on district governance at the Central Government Offices today (August 14).

  Having regard to the work requirements of District Council (DC) members, the HYAB has been arranging different trainings and visits to assist DC members in discharging their duties to improve the efficacy of district work and better serve the community. The sharing session today focused on the Government's water supply policy and arrangements, as well as how to serve district residents more effectively during water supply incidents.

  The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, attended the sharing session and delivered a speech. She said that, upon looking back at recent district work, she hoped that DC members of all districts could learn from each other in dealing with water supply incidents to minimise the impacts on district residents. Miss Mak hoped that through the sharing session, DC members could better understand the Government's policy on water supply systems and plans to replace water mains; better co-operate with government departments, District Services and Community Care Teams (Care Teams) and the ""three district committees"" to maximise synergy during emergency water supply incidents; and make preparations in advance to understand district residents' needs to serve as the bridge between the Government and district residents in water supply incidents, help distribute latest information on the water supply, and provide assistance to residents in need in a timely manner.

 Today's sharing session had two parts. In the first part, the Under Secretary for Development, Mr David Lam, shared on the challenges facing the water supplies system and relevant policies, whereas the Director of Water Supplies, Mr Roger Wong, covered short- and medium-term plans to replace water mains, and the response and reporting mechanism during emergency water incidents. The second part was experience sharing, where District Officers, DC members and Care Team representatives from Wong Tai Sin and Tuen Mun Districts shared the problems encountered and insights in handling recent water supply incidents."
金管局及證監會就穩定幣相關市場波動的聯合聲明,2025-08-14 20:00,2025-08-14 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400850.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）和證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）今日（八月十四日）就近期穩定幣相關市場波動發表以下聯合聲明。

金管局和證監會留意到近期出現與穩定幣概念相關的市場波動。這些波動看似源於擬在香港申請穩定幣發行人牌照、從事相關活動或探討此類計劃可行性等相關的公告、新聞、社交媒體帖文或市場揣測。部分聲稱亦提及近期曾與香港金融監管當局接觸。

金管局重申，在考慮穩定幣發行人牌照申請時將採取穩健及審慎方式，並設立較高的門檻。金管局強調，表達意向或提交穩定幣牌照申請，以及金管局與相關機構的溝通，只是申請牌照的過程，最終獲發牌照與否將視乎申請是否符合發牌條件。

鑑於這些計劃或申請結果存在重大不確定性，上述由市場情緒或投機驅動的波動突顯了在市場狂熱時保持警惕的必要性。股價劇烈波動可能導致非理性決策，使投資者面臨不必要的風險。

有見及此，金管局與證監會呼籲公眾應保持謹慎，深入分析相關資訊，避免只基於市場炒作或價格勢頭作出非理性投資決策。公眾應謹記在波動環境中作出深思熟慮及有根據的決定，對於減低風險至為重要。

另外，市場參與者在進行公眾溝通時應負責任行事，避免發表可能誤導投資者或造成不切實際期望的言論。

為維護市場廉潔穩健及保障投資者，證監會設有專責市場監察團隊及先進且經過驗證的系統以密切監察香港的交易活動。針對任何可能損害市場廉潔穩健的操縱或欺詐行為，證監會將採取嚴厲行動。

金管局總裁余偉文表示：「金管局採取嚴格及審慎的態度審批穩定幣發行人牌照申請。審批標準門檻甚高，在初期僅會批出數個牌照。作為正常的市場溝通，至今我們已與多家機構就穩定幣牌照進行初步溝通。這些溝通及對牌照的意向表達和申請，並不構成對任何機構的批准，也並非對其獲批牌照前景的任何認可。」

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today issued (Aug 14) the following joint statement on recent market movements in relation to stablecoins.

The HKMA and the SFC have noted recent abrupt market movements linked to the stablecoin concept. These movements appear to follow corporate announcements, news reports, social media posts or speculations regarding plans to apply for stablecoin issuer licence, engage in related activities or explore the feasibility of such initiatives in Hong Kong. Some of these claims have also mentioned recent engagements with financial regulatory authorities in Hong Kong.

The HKMA reiterates that it adopts a robust and prudent approach, with a reasonably high bar, in considering applications for stablecoin issuer licence. The HKMA emphasises that an indication of interest or application for a stablecoin licence, and the HKMA's communication with the interested entities are just part of the licensing process. The granting of licence will be determined by the fulfilment of the licensing criteria.

Given the significant uncertainties surrounding the outcomes of these preliminary plans or applications, the abrupt market movements noted above, often driven by excitement or speculation, highlight the need to stay vigilant in these frenetic situations. This heightened volatility in share prices can lead to irrational decisions, thereby exposing investors to undue risks.

In the light of this phenomenon, the HKMA and the SFC urge the public to exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and refrain from making irrational investment decisions based solely on market hype or price momentum. They should remember well-considered and informed decision-making is essential to mitigate risks in times of heightened volatility.

Market participants are reminded to exercise responsibility in public communications, and refrain from making statements that could mislead investors or create unrealistic expectations.

To safeguard market integrity and protect investors, the SFC's dedicated market surveillance team, equipped with advanced and proven systems, will closely monitor trading activities in Hong Kong. It will take stringent actions against any manipulative or deceptive practices that could compromise the integrity of the market.

  The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue,said, ""The HKMA adopts a rigorous and prudent approach in assessing applications for stablecoin issuer licence. The approval thresholds set are high, and only a handful of licences will be granted initially. We have been in preliminary communication with dozens of parties regarding stablecoin licensing as part of our market engagement. Such communication, or the related indication of interest or application, is not an indicator of approval or endorsement of any entity's prospects.""

  The Chief Executive Officer of the SFC, Ms Julia Leung,said, ""Recent share price movements associated with the stablecoin concept underscore the importance for investors to be clear-minded about the risks involved and the potential financial losses from making relevant investments. In addition to conducting thorough research themselves, they should always be mindful of the misleading prospects of gains from short-term price volatility and be wary of unsubstantiated claims, particularly those appearing on social media. The SFC will continue to monitor market activities closely and will not hesitate in taking forceful and decisive actions to maintain market integrity and protect investors from undue risks."""
Government departments drive all-out efforts to cope with rainstorm impacts,2025-08-14 19:56,2025-08-14 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400902.htm,"A Government spokesman said today (August 14) that Hong Kong has been affected by the outer rainbands of Tropical Cyclone Podul, with flooding occurring in multiple districts due to heavy rain. The Government's Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre began operating upon the issuance of Black Rainstorm Warning Signal this morning. Directorate officers from relevant departments closely monitored the situation in real time across various districts, co-ordinating efforts to address flooding, landslides, fallen trees, and road blockages, and striving to minimise the impact of the adverse weather on the public.

The Drainage Services Department (DSD) has been maintaining close liaison with the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) as it made preparations. The DSD activated the Emergency Control Centre at 6.35am today and deployed 110 emergency response teams, involving about 410 personnel and several powerful pumping robots, to handle requests for assistance from the public and flooding cases, conduct repeated inspections and carry out necessary clearance at about 240 locations prone to flooding due to blockages. As of 5pm today, six flooding cases had been confirmed and all of them were resolved within one to two hours. The affected roads have resumed normal operation. During the rainy season, the DSD will continue to enhance inspections of storm water drains and drainage channels, implement a “just-in-time clearance” arrangement prior to heavy rainfalls, and arrange immediate clearance works if needed to ensure the smooth operation of the drainage discharge system.


The Emergency Control Centre of the Geotechnical Engineering Office (GEO) was activated soon after the HKO issued a landslip warning. As of 6pm today, a total of three reports of landslides were received in Ap Lei Chau, Tsuen Wan and Lantau. The GEO has arranged inspections of the reported landslide locations.

As flooding and fallen trees were found at roads near the West New Territories (WENT) Landfill and Tsang Tsui Columbarium in Tuen Mun during the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD)’s contractor of the WENT Landfill extension has arranged workers to carry out clearance of the blocked storm water drains and remove fallen trees promptly to minimise the potential flooding risk to the public. The EPD’s North Lantau Transfer Station (NLTS) at Sham Shui Kok was also affected by the rainstorm and part of it also experienced flooding. A temporary arrangement has been made to allow single-lane and two-way traffic at its weighbridge. The EPD has been maintaining close collaboration with an NLTS contractor to implement contingency measures immediately, including carrying out inspections on the drainage channels and deploying of additional pumps, which have facilitated the NLTS to resume normal operation promptly.

The Fire Services Department, by 2pm today, handled a total of 13 reports of people trapped in lifts, 36 reports from automatic fire alarm systems, six reports of fallen trees, one report of landslides, and four reports of flooding incidents.

The Urban and New Territories Emergency Control Centres of the Highways Department were promptly activated after the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal was in force this morning to co-ordinate the handling of road emergencies, including collaborating with the GEO to clear debris at a landslide location in Southern District; and collaborating with the DSD to quickly clear roadside gullies blocked by muddy water and debris in various districts where flooding occurred, with affected road sections reopened immediately afterwards.

The Emergency Transport Coordination Centre (ETCC) of the Transport Department (TD) continues to operate around the clock and escalated its operational level when the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal was in force to closely monitor the traffic and transport conditions of important routes including trunk roads, tunnels and bridges across the territory. The ETCC expedites assessment of the impact of the rainstorm on traffic and maintains close liaison with relevant departments and public transport operators to steer and co-ordinate public transport services to meet passenger demand. The TD conducts ongoing reviews of locations affected by flooding or obstructed by objects requiring higher priority clearance. This facilitates the clearance work of departments concerned, with a view to reopening blocked routes, thereby minimising impact on the public's commuting times.

During the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal, frontline police officers remained steadfast in carrying out their duties, including cordoning off high-risk areas and evacuating stranded citizens. They also closely monitored traffic conditions, handled vehicles trapped by flooding and cleared blocked drains to ensure a smooth traffic flow. Their effort s facilitated a swift return to normalcy, helping residents resume their livelihoods as soon as possible.

The Government reminds members of the public to stay away from slopes while landslip warnings are in force. Drivers should avoid driving in hilly areas or parking their vehicles below slopes. Residents living close to slopes should stay in rooms furthest from the slopes or on high floors if possible. When a notification to evacuate is received, members of the public should follow rescuers' instructions and move immediately to a safe shelter. If they witness a landslide, they should leave immediately and call the Police when safe to do so.

The Home Affairs Department (HAD) has opened a total of 11 temporary shelters for people in need under the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal. The Emergency Co-ordination Centre of HAD began operation promptly to co-ordinate work and information dissemination in 18 districts as well as promptly follow-up on various incident reports. District offices immediately initiated relevant response measures, including co-ordinating with other departments and organisations to provide support. They have also mobilised District Council members, members of ""the three committees"" and Care Teams to disseminate the latest weather information to residents in flood-prone areas, reminding them to pay attention to safety. Members and volunteers of Care Teams will provide ongoing support to members of the public in need.


The Housing Department (HD) Communication Centre was activated to handle emergencies during the rainstorm period. As of 4pm, the Centre received 13 enquiries from residents, which were given assistance swiftly. Frontline staff of the HD also remained dedicated to their duties, taking precautionary measures against the heavy rain and stepping up patrols. The overall operation of housing estate facilities remained unaffected. In addition, during the Black Rainstorm Warning, the HD received five reports of rainwater surging from slopes or channels near its construction sites. The project teams responded swiftly and, under safe conditions, arranged for workers to assist in draining the water into nearby manholes to prevent overflow onto the roads. The HD project teams and contractors also proactively took action to clear debris from nearby drainage outlets, which effectively reduced accumulation of muddy water and minimised traffic disruption.

The weather in Hong Kong remains unstable, and the Government reminds citizens to stay updated with the latest weather reports and traffic conditions. Government department staff will continue to fulfil their duties, fully engage in response and recovery efforts, and provide appropriate support to citizens in need."
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-08-14 19:28,2025-08-14 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400855.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 14), two new imported cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. The CHP reminded members of the public to take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures, especially upon returning to Hong Kong from regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. Individuals experiencing symptoms such as fever or acute joint pain should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors of their travel history. Do not attempt self-testing, as this may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Latest case information

The two cases are from the same family, involving a 50-year-old male and his 8-year-old daughter, living in Sai Kung District. Initial investigations revealed that both patients travelled to Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, between July 20 and August 10, and could not confirm whether they had a history of mosquito bites. The male patient developed fever on August 1 while he was in Bangladesh, and joint pain in the limbs the next day (August 2). He sought medical attention from an outpatient clinic there on August 3 and did not require hospitalisation. He was informed that his blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing. His fever had subsided before returning to Hong Kong on August 10, but due to swollen joints, he attended a private hospitalon August 12. As the patient was afebrile before arriving in Hong Kong (i.e. prior to the ninth day after the onset of symptoms), he was not infectious to mosquitoes upon returning to Hong Kong and did not require hospitalisation.

For the girl, she developed fever, cough and fatigue on August 12 and attended a private hospitalyesterday (August 13). She was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and is in stable condition.

The two patients' blood samples tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing. Since they stayed in Bangladesh during the whole incubation period, the CHP considered that they were infected during travel, and the cases were classified as imported cases. Their three household contacts (including two travel collaterals who had been to Bangladesh) are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance. The CHP's epidemiological investigations are ongoing, and it has reported the cases to the health authority of Bangladesh.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of eight confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) is conducting vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations and will intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residence of the two patients, as well as locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in the scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspectionof the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow-up when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. They have also reminded residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of CF.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui reminded members of the public that currently, there are no rapid test products on the market that have been certified by international health authorities for public use in self-testing for CF. They should promptly seek medical advice if they suspect they are infected with CF and should not conduct testing on their own as this may delay proper clinical treatment. He also urged the public not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example, increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms because it may lead to ""Reye's syndrome"", a serious and potentially fatal complication.

He also added that members of the public should adopt precautions during the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can effectively prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 andpicaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


In addition, the FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD.

食安中心呼籲市民不要食用一款可能受李斯特菌污染的法國軟芝士,2025-08-14 19:12,2025-08-14 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400830.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（八月十四日）呼籲市民不要食用一款由法國進口的軟芝士，因為有關產品可能受李斯特菌污染。業界如持有受影響產品，應立即停止使用或出售。

產品資料如下：

產品名稱：St Maure Vieux Porche 45% 200G
來源地：法國
包裝：二百克
批次編號及此日期或之前食用：
（一）C5162104，二○二五年七月三十一日；
（二）C5169106，二○二五年八月五日；及
（三）C5175123，二○二五年八月十三日
進口商：歐陸食品有限公司

中心發言人說：「中心接獲歐洲聯盟委員會食品和飼料快速預警系統的通報，指上述產品可能受李斯特菌污染，正在法國進行回收。中心得悉事件後，隨即聯絡本地進口商跟進，初步調查發現上述進口商曾進口受影響批次產品。」

該進口商已按中心指示將受影響批次產品停售及下架。市民可於辦公時間致電該進口商的熱線2342 3221查詢。

發言人續說：「李斯特菌可在一般烹煮溫度下輕易消滅，但能在冷藏低溫下生存和繁殖。大部分身體健康的人在感染這種細菌後不會出現病徵或只出現輕微病徵如發燒、肌肉疼痛、頭痛、噁心、嘔吐及腹瀉等。但對初生嬰兒、長者和免疫力較低的人，則可能出現嚴重的併發症如敗血症及腦膜炎，甚至死亡。孕婦感染李斯特菌一般症狀輕微，但可導致胎兒流產、夭折、早產，或引致新生嬰兒患上嚴重的感染。」

「為減低感染李斯特菌病的風險，高危人士如孕婦應盡量進食剛煮好的熱食，徹底翻熱冷凍食物，並避免進食或在進食前徹底煮熟高風險食物（即食食物例如凍食肉類、冷燻的海產、軟芝士、沙律等），即使有關食物只屬於一道菜色的一部分。」

發言人說，市民應停止食用受影響產品，如食用有關產品後感到不適，應盡快求醫。

中心會就事件通知業界，並會繼續跟進事件和採取適當行動。調查仍然繼續。"
CFS urges public not to consume a kind of French soft cheese suspected to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes,2025-08-14 19:12,2025-08-14 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400829.htm,"  The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (August 14) urged the public not to consume a kind of soft cheese imported from France due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The trade should stop using or selling the affected product immediately if they possess it.

  The product details are as follows:

Product name: St Maure Vieux Porche 45% 200G
Place of origin: France
Pack size: 200 grams
Lot number and use-by dates:
(1) C5162104, July 31, 2025;
(2) C5169106, August 5, 2025; and
(3) C5175123, August 13, 2025
Importer: Culina (HK) Limited

  ""The CFS received a notification from the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed of the European Commission that the above-mentioned product is being recalled in France due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately contacted local importers to follow up. A preliminary investigation found that the above-mentioned importer had imported into Hong Kong the affected batches of the product concerned,"" a spokesman for the CFS said.

  The importer concerned has stopped sales and removed from shelves the affected batches of the product. Enquiries can be made to the importer's hotline at 2342 3221 during office hours.

  ""Listeria monocytogenes can be easily destroyed by cooking but can survive and multiply at refrigerator temperature. Most healthy individuals do not develop symptoms or only have mild symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea when infected. However, severe complications such as septicaemia, meningitis or even death may occur in newborns, the elderly and those with a weaker immune system. Although infected pregnant women may just experience mild symptoms generally, the infection of Listeria monocytogenes may cause miscarriage, infant death, preterm birth, or severe infection in newborns,"" the spokesman added.

""In order to reduce the risk of listeriosis, susceptible populations such as pregnant women should consume freshly prepared hot food where possible, reheat chilled food until it is hot all the way through, and avoid high-risk foods, including ready-to-eat food such as cold cuts, cold smoked seafood, soft cheeses, salads, etc, or cook them thoroughly before consumption, even if they are presented as part of a dish.""

The spokesman advised members of the public to stop consuming the affected product and seek medical treatment if they feel unwell after consuming the product concerned.

The CFS will alert the trade to the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing."

​政府各部門全力應對暴雨對本港造成的影響,2025-08-14 18:56,2025-08-14 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400852.htm,"政府發言人今日（八月十四日）表示，本港受熱帶氣旋楊柳的外圍雨帶影響，多區因暴雨出現水浸。政府的緊急事故監察及支援中心今早在黑色暴雨警告信號發出後隨即投入運作，由各相關部門的首長級人員實時密切監察各區情況，統籌協調各部門處理水浸、山泥傾瀉、塌樹、道路阻塞等情況，全力減低惡劣天氣對市民的影響。

渠務署一直與天文台保持密切聯繫並作好準備，於今早六時三十五分啓動緊急事故控制中心，並派遣110隊緊急應變隊伍，動員約410人及多部強力排水機械人，處理市民求助個案，清理水浸情況，重複巡查及清理全港約240個因淤塞而容易水浸地點。截至今日下午五時，渠務署已確認六宗水浸個案，所有個案於一至兩小時內完成處理及清除積水，受水浸影響的道路已經回復正常運作。在雨季期間，渠務署會繼續加強檢查雨水渠及排水道，同時在暴雨來臨前實施「及時清渠」，有淤塞時立即安排清理，確保雨水排放系統正常運作。

土力工程處亦於天文台發出山泥傾瀉警告後，迅速啓動緊急控制中心。截至今日下午六時，土力工程處接獲三宗位於鴨脷洲、荃灣及大嶼山的山泥傾瀉報告，並已安排人員視察山泥傾瀉事故地點。

在黑色暴雨警告信號生效期間，位於屯門的新界西堆填區和曾咀靈灰安置所附近馬路出現水浸，並有樹木倒塌。環境保護署（環保署）的新界西堆填區擴建計劃承辦商即時安排人員清理堵塞的雨水渠及移除塌樹，減低水浸風險及對巿民的影響。而環保署位於深水角的北大嶼山廢物轉運站亦受暴雨影響，轉運站部分範圍出現水浸，磅橋一度需作單線雙程運作。環保署與轉運站承辦商緊密聯繫，即時採取應變措施，派員檢查渠道及加開水泵，迅速讓轉運站回復正常運作。

消防處截至今日下午二時共處理了13宗有人被困升降機報告、36宗自動報火警系統報告、六宗樹木倒塌報告、一宗山泥傾瀉報告，以及四宗水浸事故報告。

路政署轄下的市區和新界緊急控制中心於今早黑色暴雨警告信號生效後迅速啓動，協調處理緊急道路事故的工作，包括與土力工程處協作，在南區發生山泥傾瀉的位置清理山泥；以及與渠務署協作，在各區水浸路段，迅速清理被泥水和雜物堵塞的路旁集水溝後，即時重開受影響路段。

運輸署緊急事故交通協調中心在黑色暴雨警告信號生效期間繼續24小時運作，並提升級別，密切監察全港各區主要幹道、隧道和橋樑等重要道路的交通及運輸情況。協調中心加快評估暴雨對交通造成的影響，並與相關部門和公共運輸服務營辦商緊密溝通，督導和協調公共運輸服務，應對乘客需求。署方持續檢視須優先清理水浸或路面障礙物的位置，便利相關部門執行清理工作，盡快開通阻塞道路，將對市民出行的影響減至最低。

在黑色暴雨警告信號生效期間，前線警務人員堅守崗位，除封鎖高危區域及協助受困市民撤離外，亦密切監察交通狀况，協助處理因水浸被困的車輛和清理淤塞的渠口，疏導交通，務求社會運作和市民生活盡快復常。

政府提醒市民，山泥傾瀉警告生效期間，市民應遠離斜坡；駕駛人士亦應避免駛經山區或在斜坡下停泊車輛。居住在靠近斜坡地方的市民，應盡量留在遠離斜坡的房間，並盡量逗留在較高的樓層。如市民收到通知需要疏散，應配合救援人員的指示，即時撤離到安全地方暫避。如市民發現所處地點附近發生山泥傾瀉，應立即離開，並在安全的情況下報警。

此外，民政事務總署於黑色暴雨警告信號下合共開放了11個臨時庇護中心，供有需要市民入住。民政事務總署緊急事故協調中心亦即時運作，協調各區工作及傳遞信息，迅速跟進各項緊急事故報告。各區民政事務處亦啓動相關應對工作，包括協調其他部門和機構作出支援，並動員區議員、地區「三會」委員及關愛隊向區內易受水浸影響的居民發放最新天氣資訊，提醒他們注意安全。關愛隊成員和義工會繼續向有需要市民提供支援。

房屋署聯絡中心亦於暴雨期間啓動，處理突發事故。截至今日下午四時，聯絡中心收到13宗住戶查詢，並已迅速提供協助。房屋署前線同事亦緊守崗位，作出應對暴雨防範措施，加強巡查，各屋邨設施整體運作未受影響。此外，在黑色暴雨警告期間，房屋署接獲五宗轄下工地附近斜坡或渠道雨水湧入的報告。工程團隊迅速跟進，並在安全情況下安排工人協助，將地盤積水排進附近沙井，以免湧出馬路。工程團隊與承建商亦多行一步，自發清理附近排水口雜物，有效減少泥水於附近路面積聚，避免影響附近交通及市民出行。

現時本港天氣仍然不穩定，政府提醒市民留意最新天氣消息及交通情況報告。政府各部門人員會繼續恪守職責，全力進行應對及善後工作，以及向有需要的市民提供適切支援。"
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-08-14 18:33,2025-08-14 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400822.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月十四日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱的輸入個案。中心提醒市民應採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後。若出現發燒或急性關節痛等病徵，應立即就醫並通知醫生相關旅遊史，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。

最新個案資料

兩宗個案涉及同一個家庭，包括一名50歲男子及他的八歲女兒，他們的住所位於西貢區。初步調查顯示，兩人於七月二十日至八月十日到過孟加拉國首都達卡，未能確定外遊期間自己曾否被蚊叮咬。男病人於八月一日在孟加拉國出現發燒，翌日（八月二日）四肢出現關節痛。他於八月三日在當地門診求醫，但無需住院。他獲告知其血液樣本經檢驗後對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。他於八月十日返抵香港前已經退燒，但因關節腫脹，於八月十二日到私家醫院求診。由於病人抵港前（即發病後第九日前）已經退燒，因此他抵港後對蚊子不具傳染性，無需入院。

女童方面，她在八月十二日出現發燒、咳嗽及疲倦，昨日（八月十三日）到私家醫院求診，已獲安排到醫院的無蚊環境下接受治療，情況穩定。

兩人的血液樣本經檢驗後，均對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。由於他們整個潛伏期在孟加拉國逗留，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。他們的三名家居接觸者（包括兩名曾同行到孟加拉國的人士）現時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。中心正繼續流行病學調查，並已把個案通報孟加拉國衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得八宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）正進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並會於兩名病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關基孔肯雅熱的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，目前，市面上並沒有獲國際衞生當局認證的快速測試產品，供市民自行測試基孔肯雅熱。若懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱，應立即就醫，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。市民亦不應自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

他補充，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。

Mr Yau first met with the Minister for Better Regulation and Fair Trading, the Minister for Industry and Trade, the Minister for Innovation, Science and Technology, the Minister for Building, and the Minister for Corrections of New South Wales of Australia, Mr Anoulack Chanthivong, to exchange views on enhancing co-operation between Hong Kong and Australia in various areas. Mr Yau also gave him an update on Hong Kong's latest developments and policy measures to give impetus to the city's economy, such as the reduction in liquor duty and promotion of the silver economy.

Mr Yau then met with the National President of the Australia China Business Council (ACBC), Mr David Olsson, to brief him on the direction of Hong Kong's economic development and new initiatives to promote trade, such as developing the city into a multinational supply chain management centre. They also had an exchange on enhancing business and investment collaboration between Hong Kong and Australia.

Mr Yau also attended a business roundtable luncheon with ACBC members to brief them on Hong Kong's role as a springboard for Australian businesses looking to tap into the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the broader Asian markets. He said that with its world-class infrastructure, simple and low tax regime and common law system, Hong Kong provides a stable, efficient and business-friendly environment for companies seeking to grow beyond their borders, capitalising on the city's roles as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"".

  In addition, Mr Yau toured a leading incubator for start-ups and met with some start-up operators to learn more about their operation and developments. He told them that the number of start-ups in Hong Kong reached a record high of approximately 4 700 in 2024, underlining Hong Kong's vibrant start-up ecosystem and its ideal business environment for innovators to thrive.
ã
In the evening, Mr Yau attended a cultural exchange concert presented by young Hong Kong musicians to showcase a mix of Eastern and Western musical works and instruments, highlighting Hong Kong's unique role as a bridge between East and West.
ã
Mr Yau will continue his visit to Sydney tomorrow (August 15)."
Transport Department issues pilot licence for autonomous vehicles to approve trial in Southern District,2025-08-14 17:35,2025-08-14 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400789.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) announced today (August 14) that a pilot licence for autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been issued in accordance with section 4(1) of the Road Traffic (Autonomous Vehicles) Regulation (Cap. 374AA) to approve routes for AV trial in Southern District.

  The applicant has been approved to conduct trials for 10 AVs in Cyberport. In the first phase, two autonomous private cars will operate in each road test at a specified time on specified road sections within the Cyberport campus, including Information Crescent and Cyberport Road (near The Arcade of Cyberport), passing by Cyberport 1, Cyberport 2 and Cyberport 3.

A spokesman for the TD said that the applicant commenced AV road tests in North Lantau from December 2024 and conducted small-scale passenger-carrying trials on Airport Island from end-April 2025. The scale of road tests without passengers has also been expanded from a single route to more open roads with more complex traffic scenarios. The project has largely been smooth to date, and the performance of AVs has remained stable. The TD also approved the applicant in mid-June to conduct road tests in Tung Chung. This additional pilot licence provides parallel trials running in different small communities so that useful trial data can be collected.

  The TD's label for AV shall be displayed on all AVs for identification by other road users. Details of the pilot licence have been uploaded to the TD's website on AV trials.

  The TD welcomes interested organisations or enterprises to submit applications for a pilot licence and act in concert to promote the further development of autonomous driving in Hong Kong. Upon receipt of an application, the TD will consider various factors, including the design operating range and functions of the autonomous system, relevant international or national standards/guidelines, and the road test situations, based on the Code of Practice for Trial and Pilot Use of Autonomous Vehicles before approval. The TD will exercise stringent control with a view to promoting AV trials and development in Hong Kong in a safe and orderly manner."
醫務衞生局局長總結新加坡訪問行程（附圖）,2025-08-14 17:34,2025-08-14 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400681.htm,"醫務衞生局（醫衞局）局長盧寵茂教授今日（八月十四日）率領代表團繼續在新加坡進行訪問，到訪新加坡國立癌症中心、一所製藥企業和一所綜合診療所。

代表團今早到訪Amgen Biotechnology Singapore時，介紹香港發展成為國際醫療創新樞紐的多項重要措施，包括加快改革藥械審批制度、全方位提升香港臨床試驗能力及推動創新生物醫藥成果轉化作臨床應用。盧寵茂教授強調︰「香港將繼續發揮其國際化優勢，積極推動生物醫藥技術的研發與應用，並透過香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心和粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所，進一步完善新藥研發及審批機制，吸引全球頂尖創新企業和研發機構落戶香港。這些措施不僅有助於加快病人獲得先進診療，也將鞏固香港作為國際醫療創新樞紐的地位。」

盧寵茂教授鼓勵海外藥廠善用「1+」新藥審批機制及明年開始分階段推行的「第一層審批」新藥註冊機制，將新研發藥物引入香港以應付本地醫療需要。他亦歡迎海外藥廠來港開展臨床試驗，充分發揮香港所具備的多項獨特優勢，從而促進先進生物醫藥技術的轉化和臨床應用。

代表團今早亦到新加坡國立癌症中心參觀，並介紹香港特別行政區（特區）政府在癌症防範、篩查、診斷和治療方面的工作。盧寵茂教授指出：「香港早於二○○一年成立了負責制訂癌症防控策略的癌症事務統籌委員會，並於二○一九年推出《香港癌症策略》，透過訂定工作優次和方向，減輕癌症對本港帶來的負擔。應對癌症涵蓋教育、預防和篩查、監察、研究、治療等方面。例如在預防和篩查方面，政府根據專家建議，已經推出了子宮頸普查計劃、大腸癌篩查計劃，以及乳癌篩查先導計劃。政府現正針對常見癌症以風險為本逐步制訂一些篩查計劃，包括已經推出的第二階段乳癌篩查先導計劃和基層醫療署將推行的乙肝篩查計劃，以減低乙型肝炎患者患上併發症，例如肝癌的風險。政府亦正研究人工智能協助肺癌篩查的可行性，進一步加強癌症防範。」

代表團成員包括衞生署署長林文健醫生、醫衞局副秘書長麥子濘和醫院管理局代表。他們今日結束訪問行程，並於傍晚返港。"
Secretary for Health concludes visit to Singapore (with photos),2025-08-14 17:34,2025-08-14 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400680.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, led a delegation to continue their visit to Singapore today (August 14), visiting the National Cancer Centre Singapore, a pharmaceutical company, and a polyclinic.

  During the visit to Amgen Biotechnology Singapore this morning, the delegation introduced various key measures for Hong Kong's development as an international health and medical innovation hub, including expediting the reform of the approval mechanism for drugs and medical devices, enhancing Hong Kong's clinical trial capability on all fronts and facilitating the translation of innovative biomedical research results into clinical applications. Professor Lo emphasised, ""Hong Kong will continue to leverage its international advantages to actively promote the research and development (R&D) and application of biomedical technologies. Through the establishment of the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation and the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute, we will further improve the mechanisms for new drug R&D and approval, attracting global top-notch innovative enterprises and R&D organisations to set up operations in Hong Kong. These measures will not only accelerate patient access to advanced treatments but also solidify Hong Kong's position as an international health and medical innovation hub.""

  Professor Lo encouraged overseas pharmaceutical companies to make good use of the ""1+"" mechanism for the approval of new drugs, and ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration, which will be rolled out in phases starting next year, to introduce newly developed drugs into Hong Kong to meet local healthcare needs. He also welcomed overseas pharmaceutical companies to conduct clinical trials in Hong Kong, fully leveraging the multiple unique advantages of Hong Kong to facilitate the translation and clinical application of advanced biomedical technologies.

  The delegation also visited the National Cancer Centre Singapore this morning and introduced the work of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government in cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment. Professor Lo said, ""Hong Kong has established the Cancer Coordinating Committee to formulate strategies on cancer prevention and control as early as 2001, and launched the Hong Kong Cancer Strategy in 2019, with a view to reducing the cancer burden on Hong Kong through setting work priorities and directions. Addressing cancer encompasses education, prevention and screening, surveillance, research, treatment, etc. For instance, on prevention and screening, the Government has rolled out the Cervical Screening Programme, the Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme and the Breast Cancer Screening Pilot Programme (BCSPP) based on recommendations from experts. The Government is formulating risk-based screening programmes for prevalent cancers on a gradual basis, including the BCSPP Phase II that has been rolled out and the hepatitis B screening programme to be launched by the Primary Healthcare Commission to reduce the risk of complications, such as liver cancer, of people infected with hepatitis B virus. The Government is also exploring the feasibility of using artificial intelligence to assist lung cancer screening to further enhance cancer prevention.""

  In the afternoon, Professor Lo visited the National Healthcare Group Sembawang Polyclinic for an in-depth exchange on primary healthcare services in Hong Kong and Singapore with the senior personnel of the polyclinic. He said, ""Hong Kong is actively taking forward a major reform of its primary healthcare system to address the challenges posed by an ageing population and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases. Based on the principle of 'prevention-focused and community-based', the HKSAR Government aims to build a sustainable healthcare system and fully enhance the health outcomes of citizens through systematic early intervention and co-ordinated care. In particular, we are promoting the 'Family Doctor for All' concept, strengthening the District Health Centre network across Hong Kong, and implementing the Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme that subsidises eligible citizens to undergo screening for diabetes mellitus, hypertension and blood lipid and follow-up treatment, to achieve the objectives of 'early prevention, early identification and early treatment'. I look forward to jointly exploring best practices in primary healthcare with the health authorities of Singapore, with a view to promoting sustainable healthcare development in the Asia-Pacific region.""

  Members of the delegation include the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, Deputy Secretary for Health Ms Elaine Mak, and a representative from the Hospital Authority. They concluded the visit today and will return to Hong Kong this evening."
FEHD releases third batch of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August,2025-08-14 17:28,2025-08-14 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400753.htm,"  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (August 14) released the third batch of gravidtrap indexes and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in August, covering 10 survey areas, as follows:

Among the third batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering two survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering eight survey areas in August, all were below 10 per cent, except Ma On Shan.

The FEHD has so far announced three batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August, covering 25 survey areas. Among these 25 survey areas, 15 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared with the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. July 2025, representing the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained at a low level. Eight other areas recorded a slight increase but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent. As for So Kwun Wat in Tuen Mun and Ma On Shan in Sha Tin, each with an index higher than 10 per cent, in accordance with the mechanism implemented by the FEHD in response to the recent chikungunya fever (CF) situation that strengthens mosquito control work in areas with the gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, which was originally activated when the gravidtrap index reaches 20 per cent or above, the department is collaborating with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with high mosquito infestation and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. Additionally, the FEHD will also organise exhibitions, distribute leaflets and posters, and notify the residential estates subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures. In addition, the FEHD will strengthen the monitoring of the gravidtrap indexes in these two areas to review the effectiveness of the mosquito control work.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue joining hands in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:


tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racksto prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every sevendays;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest Gravidtrap Index and the Density Index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of CF transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools, to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

八月份第三批涵蓋兩個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及八個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，除了馬鞍山，其他皆在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年八月共三批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共25個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年七月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這25個監察地區中，有15個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有八區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。至於指數高於10%的沙田馬鞍山及屯門掃管笏，按因應基孔肯雅熱情況而實施的安排（即將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域），食環署正聯同有關部門及持份者攜手找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。食環署亦會舉辦宣傳展覽、派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。此外，食環署會加強監察該兩個地區的誘蚊器指數，以檢視滅蚊工作成效。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：


收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-08-14 17:00,2025-08-14 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400765.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on August 13 to noon today (August 14), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 122 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 158 163 samples of food imported from Japan (including 103 676 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 35 848 samples of local catch respectively.

SWD and ICAC announce investigation into suspected fraudulent act seeking to obtain subsidies from Community Care Service Voucher Scheme for the Elderly,2025-08-14 16:45,2025-08-14 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400688.htm,"The Social Welfare Department (SWD) today (August 14) announced that it was collaborating with the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in an investigation into a suspected fraudulent act by recognised service providers (RSPs) of the Community Care Service Voucher Scheme for the Elderly (CCSV)seeking to obtain Government subsidies. Five persons have been arrested so far.

  Launched as a pilot programme in September 2013 and regularised in 2023, the Scheme provides needy elderly persons with more options in community care services so that they can enjoy their lives in familiar environments. Adopting the ""money-following-the-user"" concept, the Scheme not only allows elderly users to purchase suitable community care services from RSPs for meeting their needs, but also allows them to switch RSPs in a flexible manner. The services include nursing care, rehabilitation services, carer training, home safety assessments and home modification recommendations, meal delivery and escort services, etc.

  The SWD received a report last year that an RSP was suspected of making use of the Scheme to deceive Government subsidies by submitting false service records to the SWD and encouraging families or carers of the elderly persons to make fraudulent claims on their service uses. While making an immediate referral to the ICAC, the SWD also provided the ICAC with relevant information to assist their investigation.

The five arrested persons come from two different service providers. The SWD has strengthened the auditing of their service records and documents. Elderly users and their families were also contacted to ensure that the elders have obtained the services they need.

The SWD stressed that it will continue to perform its monitoring role and take follow-up actions on all suspected cases seriously. Unannounced service-monitoring visits, sampling checks as well as reviews on records and documents are conducted to ensure that RSPs have been providing services to the voucher holders according to the SWD's service requirements.

  The SWD will require RSPs to make improvements on their services or sanctions will be imposed on them if there are any irregularities. Should any RSPs fail to provide services or make improvements in accordance with the relevant requirements, the SWD will consider suspension or termination of the service agreements with the RSPs.

  The SWD reaffirms its zero tolerance for any unlawful act. Referrals will be made to the enforcement agencies for investigations to safeguard the proper use of public funds and the well-being of elderly people.

  The SWD will continue to strictly monitor the service quality of RSPs and review the relevant procedures with reference to the corruption prevention advice provided by the ICAC. Subject to the investigation results of the ICAC, the SWD may terminate the service agreements with the service providers concerned. If there are any subsidies released to non-entitled bodies, the SWD will take appropriate actions to recover the overpayments."

社區券計劃於二○一三年九月以試驗形式推行，並在二○二三年成為恆常措施，目的是為有需要的長者提供更多社區照顧服務的選擇，讓他們在自己熟悉的環境安享晚年。計劃以「錢跟人走」的概念，讓長者直接向認可服務單位，選擇所需的社區照顧服務，並可以靈活轉換服務單位。服務內容包括護理服務、康復服務、照顧者培訓、家居環境安全評估和改善建議、膳食服務及護送服務等。

社署於去年接獲舉報，指懷疑有認可服務單位透過社區券計劃詐騙政府津貼，包括向社署提供失實的服務記錄文件、教唆長者的家人╱照顧者訛稱已接受服務。社署隨即將個案轉介廉政公署跟進，同時向廉政公署提供相關資料和配合其調查工作。

五名被捕人士分別來自兩個服務單位。社署已加強審核其服務記錄及檔案，並聯絡使用有關單位服務的長者及其家人，確保長者得到所需服務。

社署強調，會繼續恪守監管角色，嚴肅跟進所有可疑個案，並透過突擊覆核探訪、抽樣檢查，以及審核記錄和檔案，確保認可服務單位按照社署訂明的服務要求，向社區券持有人提供服務。

如有違規情況，社署會向認可服務單位提出改善建議或作出懲處；如發現認可服務單位未有按相關要求提供服務及作出糾正，社署甚至會考慮暫停或終止與該認可服務單位簽訂的服務協議。

社署重申，絕不會容忍或姑息任何非法行為，定必將個案轉交執法機關跟進調查，確保公帑用得其所，並保障長者的利益。

社署會繼續嚴格監察認可服務單位的服務質素，並參考廉政公署提供的防貪建議，檢視社區券計劃的相關程序。社署會視乎廉政公署的調查結果，考慮終止違法單位的社區券計劃服務協議。如涉及有人多領款項，社署必定悉數追討。"
Volume and price statistics of external merchandise trade in June 2025,2025-08-14 16:30,2025-08-14 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400449.htm,"  Further to the external merchandise trade statistics in value terms for June 2025 released earlier on, the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (August 14) the volume and price statistics of external merchandise trade for that month.

  In June 2025, the volume of Hong Kong's total exports of goods and imports of goods increased by 10.3% and 9.2% respectively over June 2024.

  Comparing the first half of 2025 with the same period in 2024, the volume of Hong Kong's total exports of goods and imports of goods increased by 10.4% and 10.2% respectively.

  Comparing the second quarter of 2025 with the preceding quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, the volume of total exports of goods and imports of goods increased by 3.4% and 4.4% respectively.

  Changes in volume of external merchandise trade are derived from changes in external merchandise trade value with the effect of price changes discounted.

  Comparing June 2025 with June 2024, the prices of total exports of goods and imports of goods increased by 1.6% and 1.8% respectively.

  As regards price changes in the first half of 2025 over the same period in 2024, the prices of total exports of goods and imports of goods both increased by 1.9%.

  Price changes in external merchandise trade are reflected by changes in unit value indices of external merchandise trade, which are compiled based on average unit values or, for certain commodities, specific price data.

  The terms of trade index is derived from the ratio of price index of total exports of goods to that of imports of goods. Compared with the same periods in 2024, the index decreased by 0.2% in June 2025 and 0.1% in the first half of 2025.

  Changes in the unit value and volume of total exports of goods by main destination are shown in Table 1.

  Comparing June 2025 with June 2024, increases were recorded for the total export volume to Vietnam (34.7%), the mainland of China (the Mainland) (17.2%), India (12.6%) and Taiwan (2.6%). On the other hand, the total export volume to the USA decreased by 12.3%.

  Over the same period of comparison, the total export prices to Taiwan (4.8%), Vietnam (2.2%), the Mainland (1.2%) and the USA (0.8%) increased. On the other hand, the total export prices to India decreased by 1.5%.

  Changes in the unit value and volume of imports of goods by main supplier are shown in Table 2.

  Comparing June 2025 with June 2024, increases were recorded for the import volume from Vietnam (45.6%), the Mainland (16.5%), Singapore (5.9%) and Taiwan (3.8%). On the other hand, the import volume from Korea decreased by 29.6%.

  Over the same period of comparison, the import prices from all main suppliers increased: Korea (3.2%), Taiwan (3.1%), Vietnam (2.8%), Singapore (1.9%) and the Mainland (1.0%).

Mid-year population for 2025,2025-08-14 16:30,2025-08-14 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400404.htm,"  According to the statistics released by the Census and Statistics Department today (August 14), the provisional estimate of the Hong Kong population was 7 527 500 at mid-2025. The population remained virtually unchanged, as compared with that at mid-2024.

 A net inflow of 18 200 Hong Kong residents (i.e. inflow more than outflow) was recorded during the period from mid-2024 to mid-2025. Over the same period, a natural decrease (i.e. deaths surpassing births) of 14 800 was recorded, with 35 200 births and 50 000 deaths.

 Among the total population at mid-2025, 7 247 600 were Usual Residents and 279 900 were Mobile Residents. The revised figure for the year-end population for 2024 was 7 500 600. The number of Usual Residents was revised to 7 219 900 and the number of Mobile Residents to 280 700. The rate of change in population from end-2023 to end-2024 was also revised to -0.4%.

 Table 1 presents estimated total population as at mid-2025, while Table 2 presents population figures from mid-2014 to mid-2025.

Commentary

 A Government spokesperson pointed out that Hong Kong continues to benefit from various measures on talent attraction and labour importation. Over the past few years, many people have moved to Hong Kong from the Mainland and other places around the world. This has offset the impact of natural population decrease, stabilising the overall population in mid-2025, which increased by over 0.18 million compared to mid-2022.

Further information

 ""Usual Residents"" refer to two categories of people: (1) Hong Kong Permanent Residents who have stayed in Hong Kong for at least three months during the six months before or for at least three months during the six months after the reference time-point, regardless of whether they are in Hong Kong or not at the reference time-point; and (2) Hong Kong Non-permanent Residents who are in Hong Kong at the reference time-point.

 For those Hong Kong Permanent Residents who are not ""Usual Residents"", they are classified as ""Mobile Residents"" if they have stayed in Hong Kong for at least one month but less than three months during the six months before or for at least one month but less than three months during the six months after the reference time-point, regardless of whether they are in Hong Kong or not at the reference time-point.

 Under the current practice, the latest population estimate is released on a provisional basis in each round. The revised estimate will be released six months later. In other words, while the provisional population estimate for mid-2025 is released today, the corresponding revised estimate will be released in February 2026."
二零二五年年中人口數字,2025-08-14 16:30,2025-08-14 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400405.htm,"根據政府統計處今日（八月十四日）發表的數字顯示，二零二五年年中香港人口的臨時數字為7 527 500人，與二零二四年年中的數字比較大致維持不變。

二零二四年年中至二零二五年年中期間錄得18 200名香港居民淨移入（即移入多於移出）。在同期內，人口錄得14 800人的自然減少（即死亡多於出生），出生人數為35 200人，死亡人數為50 000人。

二零二五年年中的總人口中，常住居民佔7 247 600人，而流動居民佔 279 900人。二零二四年年底人口修訂數字為7 500 600人。常住居民的數字修訂為7 219 900人，流動居民的數字則修訂為280 700人。二零二三年年底至二零二四年年底的人口變動率亦修訂為-0.4%。

表一列出二零二五年年中的總人口，而表二則列出二零一四年年中至二零二五年年中的人口數字。

評論

政府發言人指出，香港繼續受惠於各項吸引人才和輸入勞工措施。過去幾年，有不少人士從內地及世界各地移入香港，抵銷人口自然減少的影響，使二零二五年年中整體人口保持穩定，並較二零二二年年中人口增加超過18萬人。

進一步資料

「常住居民」指兩類人士：（一）在統計時點之前的六個月內，在港逗留最少三個月，又或在統計時點之後的六個月內，在港逗留最少三個月的香港永久性居民，不論在統計時點他們是否身在香港；及（二）在統計時點身在香港的香港非永久性居民。

對於不是「常住居民」的香港永久性居民，如他們在統計時點之前的六個月內，在港逗留最少一個月但少於三個月，又或在統計時點之後的六個月內，在港逗留最少一個月但少於三個月，不論在統計時點他們是否身在香港，會被界定為「流動居民」。

根據慣例，每次發表最新的人口數字為「臨時數字」。而經修訂的數字會在其後的六個月公布。即是說，二零二五年年中人口的臨時數字於今天公布，而修訂數字將於二零二六年二月公布。"

Mr Tang said that Hong Kong-Shenzhen BCPs are key transportation hubs in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, which serve as vital channels for economic exchange between the two regions. He hoped to bring residents and enterprises in both regions a more convenient window through professional planning and efficient management. Mr Tang expressed his gratitude for Shenzhen's meticulous arrangements for the team to visit the Huanggang port tower and was pleased to learn that the new Huanggang Port redevelopment project is progressing smoothly. When the Hong Kong authorities reported to the Panel on Security of the Legislative Council last month on the project, members also voiced their support for it.

During the meeting, the two delegations discussed the planning and development of land BCPs, including reporting progress and exchanging views on the redevelopment projects of BCPs in Huanggang and Sha Tau Kok, and the transfer of the food control function of the Man Kam To Boundary Control Point. Concluding the meeting, Mr Tang said he will continue to follow the development of BCPs to ensure smooth project implementation, while flexibly adjusting strategies to address challenges, realise the modernisation of control points and meet the needs of citizens.

Other HKSAR Government officials attending the meeting included representatives from the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the Northern Metropolis Co-ordination Office, the Environment and Ecology Bureau, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department, the Immigration Department, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, the Architectural Services Department and the Transport Department."

勞工處發言人說：「在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告取消後，僱員如遇到實際困難而未能及時返回工作崗位，僱主應予以體諒並作出彈性處理，例如讓僱員分批復工、容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.
  
  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

衞生防護中心呼籲市民在惡劣天氣下提高警覺預防類鼻疽感染,2025-08-14 10:25,2025-08-14 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400368.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（八月十四日）呼籲市民在惡劣天氣下提高警覺，保持個人及環境衞生，預防感染類鼻疽，並特別提醒高風險群組，包括長者及長期病患者，在颱風或暴雨後應避免接觸土壤或泥水，減低感染風險。

類鼻疽是一種由類鼻疽伯克氏菌引致的疾病。類鼻疽伯克氏菌廣泛存在於土壤和泥水中，特別是濕潤的黏土。人類可能通過接觸受污染的土壤和水源（尤其是經皮膚損傷／傷口）、吸入受污染的微塵／水滴和飲用受污染的水而受到感染。長期病患者及免疫力弱人士有較大機會受感染。

根據海外文獻和本地數據，在颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令類鼻疽病菌更容易散播，令感染個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。

因應近期本港受颱風以及連日暴雨影響，中心再次提醒市民，特別是高風險群組例如長期病患者，盡量避免接觸土壤或泥水，以免受類鼻疽病菌感染。

類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得人類感染類鼻疽個案。截至昨日（八月十三日），本港今年錄得八宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。因應二○二二年深水埗出現的類鼻疽群組個案，中心及水務署已採取一系列的預防及監察措施，包括在全港所有配水庫的通風口加裝高效能空氣過濾網、加強食水的餘氯含量、持續監測配水庫及用戶水龍頭食水的餘氯含量，並加強健康教育和監測感染個案。至今包括於颱風及暴雨後所進行的監測結果未有出現異常情況，而食水水質監測的結果亦一直符合香港食水標準。

類鼻疽病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可以透過接觸患者的血液或體液而傳播。類鼻疽的病人可出現局部感染（例如皮膚膿腫）、肺炎、腦膜腦炎、敗血症或長期化膿性感染。視乎感染的部位，類鼻疽常見的病徵包括發燒、頭痛、局部痛楚或腫脹、潰瘍、胸痛、咳嗽、咳血及局部淋巴結腫大。中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。

中心再次提醒市民應採取以下措施預防感染：


避免接觸受污染的土壤；
進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿著適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴；
高風險人士如不能避免接觸受污染的水或土壤，應佩戴口罩和手套，並穿上水靴
接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

CHP appeals for heightened vigilance against melioidosis infection following adverse weather conditions,2025-08-14 10:25,2025-08-14 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400370.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 14) appealed to members of the public for heightened vigilance against melioidosis infection following adverse weather conditions and urged them to maintain personal and environmental hygiene. The CHP also specifically reminded high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water after typhoons or storms with a view to lowering infection risk.

  Melioidosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Burkholderia pseudomallei is widespread in soil and muddy water, particularly common in moist clay soil. Humans can become infected through contact with contaminated soil and surface water (especially through skin abrasions/wounds); inhalation of contaminated dust/water droplets; and ingestion of contaminated water. Those with underlying diseases or immunosuppression have higher risks of contracting the disease.

According to overseas literature and local data, Burkholderia pseudomallei in the soil and muddy water may be exposed to the ground after typhoons or storms, and the bacteria would spread more easily with strong wind and storms. As such, infection cases are more common after typhoons or storms.

In view of the recent disturbance caused by typhoon andconsecutive days of torrential rain, the CHP again reminded members of the public, in particular high-risk groups such as those with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water as far as practicable, to prevent melioidosis infection.

Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong and human infection cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year. As of yesterday (August 13), eight melioidosis infection cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded. In light of the cluster of melioidosis cases recorded in Sham Shui Po in 2022, the CHP and the Water Supplies Department have implemented a series of precautionary and monitoring measures, including the installation of high efficiency particulate air filters at the ventilators of all fresh water service reservoirs in Hong Kong, enhancing residual chlorine levels in drinking water, continual monitoring of residual chlorine level of fresh water in service reservoirs and consumers' taps, as well as health education and surveillance of infection cases. No abnormalities were detected from all surveillance results so far, including those conducted after typhoons and heavy rain, while the drinking water quality monitoring results have consistently been in compliance with the Hong Kong Drinking Water Standards.

Person-to-person transmission andanimal-to-human transmission are rare but may occur through contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. Melioidosis may present with localised infection (such as cutaneous abscess), pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, sepsis, or chronic suppurative infection. Depending on the site of infection, common symptoms of melioidosis include fever, headache, localised pain or swelling, ulceration, chest pain, cough, haemoptysis, and swelling of regional lymph nodes. The CHP appealed again to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromised conditions, in order to receive appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment.

The CHP reminded members of the public to take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. usinggloves and wearing boots;
If exposure to contaminated water or soil is inevitable, high-risk individuals should wear a mask, gloves and boots;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover any cuts or grazes with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soilor gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.

Employers and employees should make work arrangements in times of rainstorm warnings,2025-08-14 06:42,2025-08-14 07:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400199.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (August 14) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions as early as possible, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of organisations, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

  ""Employers should make prior work arrangements and contingency measures for staff which are reasonably practicable. In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

  To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or extreme conditions come to an end, when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather or extreme conditions.

  ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.

  If a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.

  If the Government makes an extreme conditions announcement, apart from those required by employers to report for duty at workplaces, employees are advised to stay in the place they are currently in or in safe places when extreme conditions are in force, instead of heading for work. Employees who have already reported for duty at workplaces could continue to work as usual in a safe manner. If the workplaces are in danger, employers should release staff from work early under feasible conditions and in a safe manner or make available a safe place as temporary shelter for employees. If the working time ends while extreme conditions are still in force, employers can release employees from workplaces in a safe manner or provide a suitable area as temporary shelter for those still at workplaces.

  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.

  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.
 
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."
僱主僱員應訂立暴雨警告下的工作安排,2025-08-14 06:42,2025-08-14 07:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400198.htm,"勞工處今日（八月十四日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在暴雨警告下及極端情況及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以保障僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主應預先制定合理而可行的工作安排和應變措施。在擬訂及執行有關安排時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮當中的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在暴雨警告或極端情況下及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。」

如果紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外或空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如政府作出極端情況公布，除與僱主就此情況下已訂立返回工作地點上班協定的人員外，僱員應留在原來的地點或安全地點，不要啓程上班。已在工作地點當值的僱員，在安全情況下可如常工作；如工作地點有危險，在可行及安全的情況下，僱主應安排僱員提早下班或到安全的地方暫避。如工作時間在極端情況生效期間結束，僱主應在安全情況下安排僱員下班，或開放合適地方讓仍在工作地點的僱員暫避。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣及極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人亦提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"
