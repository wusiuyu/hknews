WSD closely follows up on water supply incident affecting some Taikoo Shing residents,2025-11-16 16:30,2025-11-16 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600466.htm,"Regarding the appearance of black particles in the drinking water of some Taikoo Shing households, a spokesman for the Water Supplies Department (WSD) stated today (November 16) that the department is closely following up on the situation. Since receiving the notification from the Taikoo Shing management office last night (November 15) that residents (mainly from phases four and five) had found small black particles in drinking water, the WSD immediately dispatched staff to look into the incident. Water samples were collected from affected households and the sump and roof drinking water tanks of the buildings for laboratory testing. Results are pending. Based on past experience, the black particles are believed to be bitumen protective coating in the water pipes.

To facilitate pipe maintenance works, the WSD carried out temporary redirecting of water supply near Taikoo Shing last night in which the changes in water pressure may have disturbed sediment inside the pipes. At the same time, investigations revealed damage to one of the filter facilities at the estate's public water inlet, which may have allowed a small amount of sediment to enter the estate's public water pipes, causing particles to appear in some households' drinking water. The WSD routinely inspects these inlet filters, with the most recent regular check on November 3 showing no abnormalities. The damaged filter was repaired last night, and the WSD has strengthened pipe flushing in the affected system.

The WSD understands residents' concerns. To safeguard users, it is advised that if water has remained in pipes for some time, or when using taps for the first time each morning, residents should let the water run until it becomes clear before consumption. To reassure residents, water trucks have been stationed on-site to provide temporary water supply.

Additionally, the WSD has set up a service counter at the site, working with the property management office to assist residents in flushing water meters and to answer enquiries immediately. If residents notice abnormalities in their drinking water, they should notify the management office at once or call the WSD Customer Service Hotline at 2824 5000. The WSD will arrange for staff to follow up as quickly as possible."

Speech by SCST at ceremony of Asia+ Festival 2025 and Asian Ethnic Cultural Performances+ 2025 (English only),2025-11-16 15:02,2025-11-16 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600420.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the ceremony of Asia+ Festival 2025 and Asian Ethnic Cultural Performances+ 2025 today (November 16):

Consuls-General, representatives of overseas cultural organisations, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

âGood afternoon, everyone, and a very warm welcome to the ceremony of the Asia+ Festival 2025 and the Asian Ethnic Cultural Performances+ 2025, especially warm welcome for those a few who come from afar. Welcome to Hong Kong.

The Asia+ Festival was launched in 2023 with a bold vision: to create a sustainable platform for arts and cultural exchange across Asia, and the Belt and Road regions. As a flagship festive event, it reaffirms Hong Kong's role as an East-‍‍‍meets-‍West centre for international cultural exchange. It is here that we leverage our ""one country, two systems"" advantage to promote people-‍‍to-‍people bonds and cultural integration.

Now, marching into its third edition, the Festival is growing remarkably. This year, we are thrilled to welcome distinguished artists from over 30 countries and regions, 12 of which are joining us for the very first time. While Asia remains our core, our reach now extends to Belt and Road countries and regions in Europe, Africa and the Americas.

With more than 100 performances and activities - from stage shows and exhibitions to today's outdoor carnival - we expect to welcome over 100 000 citizens and visitors. Together, we will celebrate the rich tapestry of both traditional and contemporary arts from Asia and beyond.

The festivity has already begun with a stellar opening programme: a fresh, contemporary adaptation of Chekhov's ""The Cherry Orchard"" by LG Arts Center from Korea. I saw the show myself and it is wonderful. But this is just the start. The powerful rhythms of Japanese Taiko drumming, the passionate tango from Argentina, and the vibrant music and dance from Africa await you. And today, the Asian Ethnic Cultural Performances+ will unveil the legendary sounds of classical and folk music from different regions.

None of this would be possible without our incredible partners. I would like to express my heartfelt and deepest gratitude to the Consuls-General, and representatives of overseas cultural organisations here in Hong Kong. Thank you for your stalwart support for contributing such wonderful programmes. I wish you all a delightful afternoon and a truly rewarding cultural feast.

Finally, as we celebrate our cultural vibrancy, let us also remember our civic duty. I sincerely encourage all registered voters to cast your vote in the upcoming Legislative Council General Election on December 7. Let us elect a new term of responsible, visionary and capable legislators.

Thank you, and enjoy the Festival!"

政制及內地事務局局長於2025立法會「愛國者同心治港」選舉論壇：香港島東地方選區論壇後會見傳媒談話內容,2025-11-15 20:42,2025-11-15 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/15/P2025111500701.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞今日（十一月十五日）在2025立法會「愛國者同心治港」選舉論壇：香港島東地方選區論壇後會見傳媒的談話內容：

政制及內地事務局局長：各位傳媒朋友，大家好。今日下午剛剛完成港島東（地方選區）的論壇。經過五天論壇後，十個（地方）選區論壇基本上已經完成，我藉着這個機會向大家總結一下情況。經過這十場論壇，我們看到的情況是，不論在安排上，或者候選人的表現、他們的助選團隊的表現，以至現場觀眾的反應，我們覺得都達致預期的效果，亦令市民更加了解候選人的情況，從而令他們可以作出合適的投票選擇。至於今天下午的論壇，五號候選人一度身體不適，經過我們的專業處理，亦已送院治療，目前我們正在了解她的情況，希望她可以早日康復，身體健康。其他安排上，我們大致都認為整體安排是滿意的。

記者：你好，局長。想問候選人暈了論壇仍繼續的原因是甚麼？會否擔心對暈了的候選人構成不公平？有否事先向候選人說明，如果出現這類情況會怎樣部署？

政制及內地事務局局長：當然，因為整個論壇已在進行中，包括其他候選人、打氣團隊和現場觀眾亦在場，在這情況下我們決定繼續進行論壇。就候選人的情況，我們希望她身體健康，早日康復，之後我們會與她商議，或者會適當地在「節目重溫」中補回適當的時間，讓她交代政綱和參選情況。

記者：今早也出現了直播中斷的情況，是否知道原因？將來會否不選擇戶外場地，減少突發情況的出現？

政制及內地事務局局長：今早的情況，經我們初步了解，可能是由於當時天氣比較熱，在現場我們大家都見到是比較曬，在溫度比較高的情況下，令器材可能出現過熱的情況，導致電力跳閘的情況出現，我們現場的專業團隊已即時進行緊急處理，數分鐘後情況已恢復正常，整個現場論壇可以繼續進行。

記者：局長，想問早上跳了電掣，現在網上熱烈討論，主持人之後向觀眾講述情況時，提到「大家做場戲，夾一夾」，你怎樣看這個說法？其次是，過往這十區的論壇中，你認為火花足夠嗎？大家互相提問又是否足夠？

政制及內地事務局局長：我認為現場主持人最主要是希望安撫到現場觀眾的情緒，令大家明白情況並不嚴重。我們已馬上搶修，令論壇可恢復進行。我認為她當時的表現是恰當的。另外的問題是甚麼？

記者：十區的論壇已經完成了，你覺得火花夠不夠？大家的提問和質詢足夠嗎？

政制及內地事務局局長：我覺得候選人之間的互動是恰當的。大家既有互相的提問，亦有就不同的觀點提出不同的意見。這一點我覺得亦達致我們預期的效果，令大家進一步加深對候選人對各方面的觀點的了解，從而作出投票選擇的考慮。

記者：坊間有一些意見，今次論壇的火花不夠，你會不會鼓勵候選人多些接受傳媒訪問，或者參與一些論壇去說說自己的政綱，表現一下自己？

政制及內地事務局局長：當然，我相信候選人都會有不同的競選活動。無論是甚麼活動都好，能夠進一步令選民或市民多些了解他們的情況，從而作出一個合適的投票選擇，我都是會鼓勵，是好事來的。

記者：問一問剛才民安隊專業的反應，政府預案是否足夠？

政制及內地事務局局長：我剛才看見現場的同事很迅速地進行處理，亦即時召喚了救護車，令候選人可以盡快送院治理，我覺得這是合適的。

Update on chikungunya fever (with photo),2025-11-15 19:42,2025-11-15 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/15/P2025111500653.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 15), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 62 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
--------------------------------------------------------------

Regarding the recently announced local case involving a 68-year-old female who lives in Tung Hei Court in Shau Kei Wan, the CHP is still conducting genome analysis.

The CHP urged the residents living in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 15. The CHP collaborated with the Eastern District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention and questionnaire surveys to about 3 000 households in the affected areas in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 4 200 individuals through the health consultation booth on 2/F, Hing Tung Shopping Centre in Shau Kei Wan, its inquiry hotline (2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits at Tung Hei Court. Four individuals with mild symptoms have been arranged to undergo blood tests. So far one sample that has completed testing is negative for chikungunya virus. Laboratory testing for the remaining samples is continuing.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.
	

The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the CHPand the Travel Health Service, the latest Travel Health News, tips for using insect repellents, and the CHP Facebook Page, Instagram Accountand YouTube Channel, and also the Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
