個案涉及一名有長期病患的十二歲男童，他自九月十一日開始出現發燒、咳嗽和氣促，同日到律敦治醫院急症室求醫，其後被安排到該院兒童深切治療部留醫。他的鼻咽拭子及咽喉拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發休克。他目前仍然留醫，情況穩定。

中心調查發現，男童曾接種二○二四／二五季度流感疫苗。他入住的院舍有另外七名宿生在九月十一日出現輕微流感病徵，他們已求醫，全部無需入院。中心已向院舍建議需實施的感染控制措施，包括建議所有宿生及職員佩戴口罩、分隔出現流感病徵的宿生、適當開啓窗戶以改善院舍的通風情況、徹底清潔消毒院舍及增加消毒頻率。中心會繼續對該院舍進行醫學監察。

另外，本港已進入夏季流感季節，學校或院舍的流感樣疾病爆發近兩周明顯上升。中心在八月三十一日至九月六日的一周錄得 26 宗涉及學校或院舍的流感樣疾病爆發（共影響323人），而本周首六天（九月七日至十二日）已錄得62宗爆發個案（共影響567人）。上述爆發個案分別有15宗（共影響264人）及55宗（共影響518人）涉及學校，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（8宗）、小學（39宗）及中學（23宗），其中六宗學校爆發個案影響23至112人。

衞生署已公布二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃將於九月二十五日展開，為合資格的高風險群組透過各項疫苗注射計劃免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗。當中包括多項新措施鼓勵和便利市民接種，包括進一步優化季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃，讓所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗以及「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。

為了讓市民更加方便接種疫苗，政府會繼續開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有6個月至2歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下的25個地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的74間普通科門診和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱衞生防護中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可由九月二十二日上午九時起透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。

中心提醒高危人士到公眾地方時，應佩戴外科口罩。市民乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，亦應考慮佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，並考慮應否上班或上學。有關最新的流感資訊，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"
律政司司長在香港普通法制度助力「一帶一路」建設研討會及交流晚宴開場發言（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-09-12 21:12,2025-09-12 22:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200819.htm,"以下是律政司司長林定國資深大律師今日（九月十二日）在新疆烏魯木齊的香港普通法制度助力「一帶一路」建設研討會及交流晚宴的開場發言：

尊敬的乃廳長（新疆維吾爾自治區司法廳廳長乃比江‧依不拉伊木）、耿會長（新疆律師協會會長耿寶建）、各位嘉賓、各位女士們、先生們：

大家下午好。我今日非常激動，因為我上次來新疆時是二十多三十年前，還是年紀很小的時候，這次來到感覺很不一樣。

首先，我代表香港律政司表示非常榮幸、非常感謝有機會得到新疆司法廳的協助，舉辦今日的研討會。我也特別感謝今日出席的大約100名來自新疆不同企業、不同律所的領導參加研討會。我代表香港代表團的成員感謝你們參與今日的活動，謝謝你們。

接下來，香港代表團的成員都會發言，跟你們進行交流，但我希望首先談一個事情，今日我帶來的不單是香港律政司的同事，還有香港兩個法律專業團體——香港律師會和香港大律師公會的領導，還有香港主要仲裁機關的理事，也有香港交易所負責上市的領導，也有香港金融銀行界的代表，希望今日能提供一個全面覆蓋的，介紹香港法律服務的機會，也盡可能回應你們最關心的一些問題，嘗試解答你們的疑問。

今日的題目是香港普通法制度助力「一帶一路」建設。我認為這個主題定得非常好。「一帶一路」是習主席在二○一三年首先提出的，今年已經是第十二個年頭。在現今複雜的地緣政治的情況下，我覺得落實「一帶一路」倡議比以前來得更重要。

就在幾天以前，在九月八日，習主席在金磚國家領導人的高峰會上有個重要講話。他提到三個「堅持」：第一是堅持多邊主義、第二是堅持開放共贏、第三是堅持團結合作。團結合作就是共同與其他友好的國家共同發展，在這方面他特別提到共同推進高質量共建「一帶一路」。

新疆在「一帶一路」的角色，你們是專家，我也不用多講，新疆的獨特地理位置在作為國家跟中亞、南亞、西亞聯繫的樞紐扮演一個非常重要的角色。今日我有機會跟陳書記（新疆維吾爾自治區黨委書記陳小江）和司法廳進行了一些非常深入的交流，非常理解你們其中一個重要的發展範疇也就是配合「一帶一路」的發展，強化法治建設，尤其是希望營造一個一流的營商環境。我相信一個一流的營商環境，離不開國際化、市場化、法治化這三個概念。

回到我們香港的角色，香港在「一帶一路」倡議提出以來，一直都是非常積極的參與者、支持者，作出我們的貢獻。就在前日跟昨日，香港剛剛舉行了第十屆「一帶一路國際高峰論壇」。在會上，很多「一帶一路」國家的代表都來香港發表重要講話，行政長官也發表講話。內地商務部的副部長、國資委的領導也來香港。提到我們香港的角色，離不開幾個事情。最關鍵的還是需要用好香港在「一國兩制」下一些獨特的制度優勢，更好地融入國家的發展大局。其中一個就是作為一個功能平台，提供一系列服務。當然，香港其中一個制度優勢就是法律服務。香港在國家政策的定位就是作為亞太區的國際法律及爭議解決服務中心。我們作為國際法律中心的基礎就是普通法制度。我想用這個機會簡單地說明究竟普通法制度有甚麼特別的地方。我相信有六點涵蓋，加起來建構成為香港獨特的一個法律制度。

第一，我們的法律制度非常穩定。普通法制度在香港已經運作超過180年，而在回歸以後，普通法制度在《基本法》的保障下繼續運作。中央對普通法的落實是非常堅定的，最好的例子就是在今年五月三十日，包括我們國家以內，三十三個國家在香港簽署了《關於建立國際調解院的公約》，我相信大家也有聽說過這事。這是第一個國際之間以調解方式解決爭議的機構，國際調解院總部也將設在香港。所以，我們的普通法制度得到中央的支持，受到《基本法》的保障，是非常穩定的。

第二是便利。香港不但是國家唯一實行普通法的地區，也是全世界唯一中英雙語的普通法制度。香港的民商事法律與國際習慣、國際通行的一些法律規矩相符，也是國際社會所熟悉。根據瑞士國際管理發展學院發布的《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港的競爭力位列全球第三，其中在「商業法規」排名全球第一，充分顯示我們的法律競爭力在國際間享有非常高的地位，營商是非常便利的。

第三是非常安全。香港《基本法》保障了資本和基金的自由流通，所有的投資、商業活動也受到嚴格的監管和保障。我們也設立新的監管框架，確保新興業務能有序健康的發展。我舉個例，今年八月，我們剛剛通過，也生效了《穩定幣條例》，stable coin，即數字貨幣，為法幣穩定幣的發行設立發牌制度，通過完善虛擬資產活動的監管框架、有效的管控風險，推動金融創新。

第四是可信。可信的意思是香港司法機關在《基本法》下擁有獨立的審判權，包括終審權。我們的終審法院，除了香港本地的法官以外，也邀請了來自英國、澳大利亞、新西蘭等普通法司法管轄區非常傑出的法官，出任終審法院的非常任海外法官。在過去的六年間，終審法院的案例在其他普通法的地區常常被引用，次數已經超過五十次，也反映國際社會對香港司法機關水平的認可。除了訴訟以外，我們的國際仲裁服務也是站在全世界前面的位置。根據倫敦瑪麗皇后大學的2025年《國際仲裁調查》，我們是全球第二最受歡迎的仲裁地，未來當然我們會更加努力。

第五，就是我們擁有非常豐富的國際法律人才。目前，香港有超過13 500名的執業律師和大律師，80多家外地律師事務所，超過1 500名來自45個司法管轄區的外地律師。同時，香港的律師事務所在海外和內地註冊的辦事處總共超過380家。所以，香港法律服務提供的不單是有關香港的法律服務，你通過香港的法律服務也能享受其他地區有關的法律服務，因為我們跟其他地區的法律聯繫是非常緊密的。我們涵蓋的範圍也是從非訴訟到解決爭議全覆蓋的。

最後，第六就是我們的法律制度跟內地的法律制度有緊密的銜接。雖然在「一國兩制」下，我們的法律制度是普通法制度，但是不等於我們跟內地的法律制度沒有連結點。相反，我們是通過不同的法律合作和司法協助的安排，兩個法律制度是有非常緊密的銜接。到今天為止，香港特區與內地簽署了九項民商事的司法協助，涵蓋範圍很廣，舉幾個例子，包含對民商事法院判決的互相承認和執行，也包含對仲裁結果的承認和執行等。總的來說，香港的普通法制度穩定、便利、安全、可信，擁有豐富的國際法律人才，與內地的法律制度銜接。這六個特點加起來就建構成為一個全世界獨一無二的法律制度，我相信我們的法律制度能有效的提供協助，促進新疆更好的落實「一帶一路」倡議的所有種種不同的項目。

對於未來我們如何合作，我希望提三個建議、三點想法。第一，我們是非常積極支持新疆和香港，無論是政府層面還是業界層面加強聯繫。稍後，我將會跟司法廳簽署一個框架協議，大律師公會也會與新疆律師協會簽訂協議。去年，香港律師會和新疆律師協會簽署了一個合作的協議，我希望通過這個框架性的協議，我們能建立一個比較恆常的合作機制，為未來進一步合作建構一個很好的基礎。剛剛乃廳長跟我探討一些可能性，譬如說，邀請新疆的法務人員來香港進行一些短期交流；邀請你們來參加我們的國際性會議等，都是在我們有一個比較穩固的框架協議下可以探討的事情。

第二，我也希望鼓勵特別是新疆企業的法務代表、律師事務所也好，不但是增加對我們香港法律技術的認識，也在談判或是制訂「一帶一路」對外貿易的協議、合同的時候，多考慮幾個事情。第一，多考慮選用香港的法律作為有關合約、合同的使用法律。第二，多考慮選用香港作為建構合作的工具，譬如在香港成立公司。第三，多考慮利用香港作為融資平台，譬如在香港合資一間公司；或是當下一步順利擴張，就運用香港的商業工具作為上市融資的平台。第四，多考慮選用香港作為爭議解決的地方，無論是仲裁、訴訟、調解也好。

第三，我們也積極地推動新疆和香港在能力建設方面的合作。律政司在去年底成立香港國際法律人才培訓學院，今年已經跟最高人民法院和司法部進行合作項目，邀請內地的法官和法律專業人士到香港接受比較針對性、專業性和實務性較強的培訓活動。我希望將來我們能加強涉外人才培養這方面的合作。最後，新疆毫無疑問是我們國家「一帶一路」倡議非常重要的橋頭堡。我們常常說我們香港是一個「內聯外通」的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」，我相信未來我們有非常廣闊的空間，優勢互補、各展所長，一同為我們國家的發展，一同為「一帶一路」倡議作出我們的貢獻，讓「一帶一路」倡議能更好地開展，更好地落實習主席對「一帶一路」倡議的期望。

再次感謝各位出席今日的研討會，謝謝。"

CHP investigates two epidemiologically linked food poisoning clusters,2025-09-12 20:10,2025-09-12 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200791.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (September 12) investigating two epidemiologically linked food poisoning clusters affecting six persons. The CHP of the DH reminded the public to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent foodborne diseases.

The two clusters involved three males and three females aged between six and 65. They developed abdominal pain, vomiting, fever and diarrhea about seven to 10 hours after consuming food prepared by éå°ç« at Shops 46 and 47 on the ground floor of the Belvedere Square, Belvedere Garden Phase 3, 625 Castle Peak Road, Tsuen Wan in the New Territories on September 10.

Five affected persons sought medical advice and one of them required hospitalisation.All of the affected individuals are currently in stable condition.
 
A preliminary investigation revealed that red onion chicken was the food item that all of the affected individuals had in common. Officers of the CHP and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, including personnel of the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch, conducted a joint investigation at the restaurant. They examined the handling process and food hygiene, and collected food and environmental samples for testing.

The sauce concerned was prepared too far in advance and was stored at an improper temperature for a prolonged period. The CFS immediately instructed the premises concerned to suspend serving the incriminated food items with immediate effect and carry out cleaning and disinfection of the premises. The officers have also provided health education related to food safety and environmental hygiene to the staff of the premises.

The investigation of the CHP and CFS is ongoing.

To prevent foodborne diseases, members of the public are reminded to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times. When dining out, one should:


Avoid eating raw seafood;
Be a discerning consumer in choosing cold dishes, including sashimi, sushi and raw oysters at a buffet;
Choose pasteurised eggs, egg products or dried egg powder for dishes that often use undercooked eggs;
Patronise only reliable and licensed restaurants;
Ensure food is thoroughly cooked before eating during a hotpot or barbecue meal;
Handle raw and cooked foods carefully and separate them completely during the cooking process;
Use two sets of chopsticks and utensils to handle raw and cooked foods;
Avoid patronising illegal food hawkers;
Drink boiled water;
Susceptible populations, including those with weakened immunity, the elderly, pregnant women and young children are at a higher risk of foodborne diseases, so they should not consume raw or undercooked foods;
Refrain from trying to use salt, vinegar, wine or wasabi to kill bacteria as they are not effective; and
Always wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet.

蚊傳疾病登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的最新情況,2025-09-12 19:15,2025-09-12 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200741.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月十二日）公布登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的最新情況。

登革熱

由九月五日至昨日（九月十一日），中心錄得三宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期到過印度。

截至昨日，今年錄得47宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。在二○二三年，全球80多個國家及地區共呈報了逾650萬宗病例和7 300多宗登革熱相關死亡個案。世衞於二○二四年更錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點普遍流行，印度尼西亞、印度、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年至今已分別錄得超過三萬宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過3 000宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得超過1 000宗本地感染病例，於八月二十五日至三十一日的一周內已錄得164宗，其中以廣州、深圳、潮州、佛山和中山錄得的病例最多。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

基孔肯雅熱

截至今日下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。本港今年累計錄得16宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

今年一月至七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗病例，當中約90宗為死亡個案。亞洲方面，二○二五年印度及印度尼西亞分別錄得超過32 000宗及17 000宗病例，其他錄得病例的地區包括內地、孟加拉國及斯里蘭卡等。雖然廣東省基孔肯雅熱的情況在八月下旬起已受到控制，每日只有零星新增個案，但現時全球多國仍爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於登革熱及基孔肯雅熱確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：

"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, dengue fever and chikungunya fever",2025-09-12 19:15,2025-09-12 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200745.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 12) reported the latest situation of dengue fever (DF) and chikungunya fever (CF).

Dengue fever

From September 5 to yesterday (September 11), the CHP recorded three imported DF cases. The patients had travelled to India during the incubation period.

As of yesterday, 47 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases and more than 7 300 dengue-related deaths were reported in over 80 countries/territories. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number.

DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 30 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 000 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded over 1 000 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 164 cases were recorded in a week between August 25 and 31, with the highest number of cases recorded in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chaozhou, Foshan and Zhongshan.

Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

Chikungunya fever

As of 5pm today, no new cases of CF had been recorded. So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 16 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.
  
From January to July this year, more than 240 000 cases were recorded in 16 countries/regions worldwide, including about 90 deaths. In Asia, India and Indonesia have recorded more than 32 000 and 17 000 cases respectively in 2025. Other places that have recorded CF cases include the Mainland, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Although the situation in Guangdong Province has been under control since late August, with only sporadic new cases reported each day, CF outbreaks continue in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients of DF and CF, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

â
âThe CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
HKUST and French companies sign MOU to collaborate on low-carbon retrofit pilot project (with photos),2025-09-12 19:10,2025-09-12 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200234.htm,"  Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) is pleased to announce today (September 12) the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and a consortium of French companies, including Schneider Electric, Veolia, Bouygues-Dragages, Egis, and Saint-Gobain. This partnership will launch a pioneering low carbon retrofit pilot project, marking a pivotal step toward achieving Hong Kong's carbon neutrality goal by 2050, a goal shared by France.
  
  This MOU stems from the Team France Green Paper on collaboration opportunities to accelerate Hong Kong's path to carbon neutrality by 2050 published in April 2024. This was followed by work on a pilot project proposal for a net zero-carbon building, which was shared with the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee.

  The pilot project represents a concrete outcome of the Team France Green Paper, which identified collaborative opportunities to support Hong Kong's decarbonisation journey. It will focus on the energy efficiency retrofitting of an existing building at the HKUST, serving as a demonstration of how public-private partnerships can drive sustainable urban development. By showcasing innovative financing models and advanced retrofitting technologies, this first HKUST pilot aims to pave the way for broader adoption of similar projects.
  
  Key project features include:


Joint Assessments: Evaluate and identify retrofitting opportunities within the HKUST campus buildings to estimate energy-saving potential.
Capacity Building: Raise awareness about retrofitting as a key decarbonisation strategy by sharing results and best practices with industry and government.
Develop data-driven policy: Utilize advanced digital tools to assess energy-saving measures and support policy frameworks and incentive schemes in Hong Kong
Technology Adoption: Showcase innovative energy management technologies to enhance energy and operational efficiency.
Living Laboratory: Create experiential learning opportunities and test research-driven solutions to address sustainability challenges.

  
  The signing ceremony of the MOU took place at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. The MOU was signed by the Vice President for Administration and Business of the HKUST, Professor Tam Kar-yan; the President of Schneider Electric Hong Kong, Mr Jonathan Chiu; and the Chief Executive Officer of Veolia Hong Kong and Macau, Mr Laurent Pelletier. The signing ceremony was witnessed by the French Ambassador to China, Mr Bertrand Lortholary; the Consul-General of France in Hong Kong and Macau, Ms Christile Drulhe; the Director-General of Investment Promotion of InvestHK, Ms Alpha Lau; and Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion of InvestHK Mr Arnold Lau.

  ""French companies have always been at the forefront of innovation when it comes to sustainable infrastructure. We are proud to support them in bringing their advanced, green solutions to Hong Kong's dynamic built environment. As our two territories share the same goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, this pilot project demonstrates how France and Hong Kong are natural partners to build a greener, more resilient future, in line with the roadmap agreed between our two Presidents to strengthen our co-operation to promote sustainable development and environment protection while addressing the challenges of climate change,"" Mr. Lortholary said.
  
  ""This pilot project is not only about sustainability, but also about market creation and investment facilitation,"" said Ms Lau. ""With over 90 per cent of Hong Kong's existing buildings expected to still be in use by 2050, the retrofitting sector represents a significant opportunity for investment, innovation, and job creation. We are pleased to have facilitated this initiative by connecting strategic partners and enabling collaboration. InvestHK is committed to supporting companies of all sizes and sectors as they expand in Hong Kong, strengthen their regional presence, and turn innovative ideas into commercially viable opportunities.""
  
  ""Retrofitting is not just good for the planet. It's good for business,"" said Professor Tam. ""This initiative represents an important step toward building the evidence base that Hong Kong needs to accelerate low-carbon transformation in the built environment. By working closely with industry partners, we aim to generate real-world data, performance benchmarks, and insights that can inform policy, guide investment, and unlock scalable solutions. This initiative will help quantify the value of retrofit-led innovation and offer a blueprint for green growth.""
  
  ""With less than 2 per cent of the global building stock being retrofitted annually, this initiative is a timely and strategic step towards decarbonizing Hong Kong's built environment. It aims to shift public and market perceptions from viewing environmental upgrades as a cost burden to recognising them as a strategic economic driver with long-term competitiveness. Leveraging digitisation and electrification, we must embrace innovative retrofit solutions, such as AI, Digital Twin, EV charging, and smart grid systems. This collaborative approach will help advance our green technology applications and transformations, ultimately accelerating sustainability and the green economy in Hong Kong,"" said Mr Chiu.
  
  ""Optimising existing buildings' energy efficiency is one of the main levers for Hong Kong to achieve its carbon neutrality goal, as buildings' electricity consumption is responsible for 60 per cent of the carbon emissions,"" said Mr Pelletier. ""By combining the expertise of Veolia, Schneider Electric, Bouygues-Dragages, Egis, and Saint-Gobain, we can propose a more impactful set of solutions for retrofitting, leveraging the complementarity of our know-how. Beyond technology, we are also proposing an innovative business model, where our team, with the help of financial partners, can support the initial investment.""
  
  Sustainable development and the green economy are among the strategic sectors InvestHK prioritises in its foreign direct investment promotion efforts. The department actively attracts international companies that bring cutting-edge solutions in energy efficiency, climate technology, and smart infrastructure. InvestHK is committed to supporting international partners in building a future-ready economy in Hong Kong, where sustainability and foreign direct investment go hand in hand.

反非法勞工行動拘十二人（附圖）,2025-09-12 19:05,2025-09-12 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200719.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於九月九日至昨日（九月十一日）在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，包括聯同香港警務處執行的「冠軍行動」。行動中共拘捕十名懷疑非法勞工、一名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及一名逾期逗留人士。

反非法勞工行動中，入境處特遣隊人員搜查於一個洗衣工場拘捕八名懷疑非法勞工及一名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為三男五女，年齡介乎二十九至四十八歲。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為一名五十二歲女子。

於「冠軍行動」中，執法人員於紅磡、九龍城及西區搜查了一百零二個目標地點，共拘捕兩名懷疑非法勞工及一名逾期逗留人士。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為兩名男子，年齡分別為四十八及五十二歲。另外，被捕的逾期逗留人士為一名四十九歲女子。

有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"

Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years.""

The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."

Secretary for Health chairs 29th meeting of Research Council under Health Bureau (with photos),2025-09-12 17:45,2025-09-12 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200554.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, chaired the 29th meeting of the Research Council (RC) under the Health Bureau today (September 12) to review the research translation outcome of the Health and Medical Research Fund (HMRF), discuss the new research translation strategy of the HMRF, and consider the funding applications for investigator-initiated research projects received during the period from last December to March this year.

  Professor Lo said, ""If research findings can be successfully translated and truly applied, not only can they improve citizens' health and enhance public health standards, but also have the potential to develop into biopharmaceutical industry. This plays a pivotal role in addressing Hong Kong's increasingly complex health challenges.""

  He stressed, ""The HMRF is committed to promoting research translation and supports projects with clear translation potential. I am glad to see that HMRF-funded research projects not only brought a positive influence on healthcare policies and practices, but also supported researchers in generating new knowledge in the biomedical and healthcare realm to promote medical advancement. In addition, a number of HMRF-funded projects have successfully secured additional funding for subsequent research, enabling further development and translation of their findings. These fruitful results demonstrate that the HMRF is highly effective in promoting the translation of academic research into practical applications. The Government will continue to foster scientific research and innovation in healthcare through the HMRF, as well as support high-quality scientific research and innovative projects that demonstrate clear translational potential. At the same time, the Government will also develop new quality productive forces in the field of health and medical research, including capabilities in clinical trials and new drug development, with a view to developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub.""

  The RC was pleased to note the significant translation results and impacts of the HMRF-funded research, as revealed from the surveys conducted on 124 research projects in 2025. These include:

(i) Close to 70 per cent of the funded projects had their research findings published in peer-reviewed journals, showcasing that the HMRF is effective in supporting knowledge generation;

(ii) 40 per cent of the funded projects received additional funding support from the HMRF and other funding sources for subsequent research, with each project receiving an additional funding (excluding the HMRF) amounting to seven times that of the original HMRF grant on average;

(iii) Examples of applications in the formulation of healthcare policies and practices include:

(a) An HMRF-funded study found that an ortho-geriatric multidisciplinary care model for patients with fragility hip fractures led to better clinical outcomes, including shorter stays in acute and rehabilitation hospitals, less chest infections as complications, higher functional recovery at discharge, and improved system efficiency. This innovative service model has been widely adopted in the Hospital Authority (HA);

(b) Another HMRF-funded study evaluating the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of online cognitive behavioural therapy to treat anxiety and depression has informed the development of digital mental health platform under the Jockey Club TourHeart+ Project (JCTH+). Relevant research findings became an integral part of the counselling services of eight local tertiary institutions to develop a stepped care system with online-offline hybrid interventions to support students; and

(c) An HMRF-funded cohort study found that specific serum biomarkers could improve risk prediction of liver cancer in chronic hepatitis B patients receiving antiviral treatment. These findings informed the ""EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Management of Hepatitis B Virus Infection"" released by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) this year.

  Moreover, over the past year, 25 HMRF-funded projects reported to have patent applications for further development, including commercialisation. These projects covered a wide variety of health issues, including novel drug candidates, gene therapies, new vaccine platforms and other emerging technologies. Notably, an HMRF-funded project validated a novel mechanism to identify fertilisation-competent sperms. These findings further informed another HMRF-funded project and led to the development of the world's first artificial intelligence model to accurately and efficiently assess sperm fertilisation capacity to support assisted reproduction treatments. The model won a Silver Award at the 50th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva this year.

  At the meeting, the RC also endorsed the new research translation strategy of the HMRF. The strategy spans the entire research cycle and aims to further enhance the practical and translational value of HMRF-funded research. Over the past year, the HMRF consulted key stakeholders on the draft strategy, including academia, the public healthcare sector, healthcare professional bodies and community partners. The stakeholders expressed their support for the draft strategy and offered their views to make the new strategy more comprehensive. The new research translation strategy covers four priorities, namely: (i) to shape research translation culture; (ii) to build quality partnership; (iii) to promote end-of-grant translation; and (iv) to monitor and evaluate research outcomes.

  During the meeting, the RC also considered the funding applications for investigator-initiated research projects under the HMRF received from last December to March this year and endorsed a funding commitment of $219 million involving 205 projects. The exact details will be released to the applicants in late September.

  Professor Lo said, ""With the growing breadth and depth of HMRF research, I encourage researchers to continue to make full use of the HMRF to accelerate the translation of their research outcomes, with a view to fostering medical innovation and supporting the implementation of evidence-based healthcare policies and practices to benefit the general public.""

  Chaired by the Secretary for Health, the RC comprises members including representatives and professors from two medical schools and healthcare-related disciplines of various universities as well as representatives from the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, the Department of Health, the University Grants Committee and the HA. The RC provides strategic steer on funding for health and medical research and health promotion projects. It oversees the management of funds under the Health Bureau, including the HMRF, encompassing allocation of funding to approved projects."

28 landlords of subdivided units under regulated tenancies convicted of contravening relevant statutory requirements,2025-09-12 17:38,2025-09-12 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200668.htm," Twenty-eight landlords of subdivided units (SDUs), who contravened Part IVA of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7) (the Ordinance), pleaded guilty and were fined between $800 and $7,200, amounting to a total of $75,200, on September 5 and today (September 12) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. Since the Ordinance came into force, the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) has continuously strengthened enforcement actions and has prosecuted a total of 1 222 cases to date. Among the 859 cases dealt with by the court, all were successfully convicted, which involved a total of 747 SDU landlords, amounting to a total of $2,286,510. In addition, 363 cases are pending a hearing.

  The offences of these 28 landlords include (1) failing to submit a Notice of Tenancy (Form AR2) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation within 60 days after the term of the regulated tenancy commenced; and (2) requesting the tenant to pay money other than the types permitted under the Ordinance (including requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance).

  The RVD earlier discovered that the landlords failed to comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance. Upon an in-depth investigation and evidence collection, the RVD prosecuted the landlords.

  A spokesman for the RVD reiterated that SDU landlords must comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance, including prohibiting landlords from doing any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of members of the tenant's household, with the intention of causing the tenant to give up occupation of the SDU; or requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance, and also remindedtenants of their rights under the Ordinance, including a four-year (i.e. two years plus two years) security of tenure. He also stressed that the RVD will continue to take resolute enforcement action against any contraventions of the Ordinance. Apart from following up on reported cases, the RVD has been adopting a multipronged approach to proactively identify, investigate and follow up on cases concerning landlords who are suspected of contravening the Ordinance. In particular, the RVD has been requiring landlords of regulated tenancies to provide information and reference documents of their tenancies for checking whether they have complied with the requirements of the Ordinance. If a landlord, without reasonable excuse, refuses to provide the relevant information or neglects the RVD's request, the landlord commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine at level 3 ($10,000) and to imprisonment for three months. Depending on the actual circumstances, and having regard to the information and evidence collected, the RVD will take appropriate actions on individual cases, including instigating prosecution against suspected contraventions of the Ordinance. In addition, the RVD has started a new round of publicity and education work to enhance public awareness about the key offences and penalties, emphasising that the RVD proactively checks whether landlords have committed the offences under the Ordinance.

  To help curb illegal acts as soon as possible, members of the public should report to the RVD promptly any suspected cases of contravening the relevant requirements. Reporting can be made through the telephone hotline (2150 8303), by email (enquiries@rvd.gov.hk), by fax (2116 4920), by post (15/F, Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, 303 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon), or in person (visiting the Tenancy Services Section office of the RVD at Room 3816-22, 38/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, and please call 2150 8303 to make an appointment). Furthermore, the RVD has provided a form (Form AR4) (www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/ar4.pdf) on its website to facilitate SDU tenants' reporting to the RVD.

  The RVD reminds that pursuant to the Ordinance, a regulated cycle of regulated tenancies is to comprise two consecutive regulated tenancies (i.e. the first-term tenancy and second-term tenancy) for an SDU, and the term of each regulated tenancy is two years.

二零二五年第二季香港本地居民總收入及對外初次收入流量數字,2025-09-12 16:30,2025-09-12 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200426.htm,"政府統計處今日（九月十二日）發表二零二五年第二季的香港本地居民總收入及相關數字的初步統計數字。

二零二五年第二季以當時市價計算的香港本地居民總收入（指香港居民透過從事各項經濟活動而賺取的總收入）較上年同期上升5.2%至8,922億元。同季以當時市價計算的本地生產總值估計為7,852億元，按年升幅為3.7%。二零二五年第二季的本地居民總收入較本地生產總值多出1,070億元，相當於該季本地生產總值的13.6%，主要是由於投資收益淨流入。

扣除其間價格變動的影響後，二零二五年第二季的香港本地居民總收入較上年同期實質上升3.6%，而本地生產總值在同季實質上升3.1%。

二零二五年第二季的香港初次收入（主要包括投資收益）總流入為6,246億元，較上年同期上升4.8%，相當於該季本地生產總值的79.5%。與此同時，二零二五年第二季的初次收入總流出亦較上年同期上升2.3%至5,176億元，相當於該季本地生產總值的65.9%。

就投資收益流入的主要組成部分而言，直接投資收益較上年同期上升3.5%，主要是因為部分本地大型企業在外地的直接投資收益增加。證券投資收益較上年同期錄得19.4%的顯著升幅，主要是由於本地投資者獲取的非本地股權證券的股息收益增加及本地投資者獲取的非本地債務證券的利息收益增加。

就投資收益流出的主要組成部分而言，直接投資收益較上年同期上升3.1%，主要是由於部分大型跨國企業在本地的直接投資收益增加。證券投資收益顯著上升19.6%，主要是由於非本地投資者獲取的本地股權證券的股息收益增加及非本地投資者獲取的本地債務證券的利息收益增加。

按國家／地區分析，二零二五年第二季，中國內地繼續是香港初次收入總流入的最主要來源地，佔當季總流入的42.3%。其次是英屬維爾京群島，佔12.8%。在初次收入總流出方面，中國內地及英屬維爾京群島在二零二五年第二季繼續是最主要目的地，分別佔當季總流出的30.5%及21.8%。

其他資料

本地生產總值及本地居民總收入是量度經濟表現的緊密相關指標。本地生產總值指一個經濟體的所有居民生產單位的生產總值。本地居民總收入指一個經濟體的居民透過從事各項經濟活動而賺取的總收入，不論該等經濟活動是在該經濟體的經濟領域內或外進行。

二零二三年第三季至二零二五年第二季的本地居民總收入及按收入組成部分劃分的初次收入流量數字載列於表甲，而有關季度按選定主要國家／地區劃分的初次收入流入及流出的數字則分別載列於表乙（1）和乙（2）。

二零二三年及以後的本地生產總值和本地居民總收入數字，以及二零二四年及以後的初次收入流量數字，在納入更多數據後會作出修訂。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《二零二五年第二季本地居民總收入及對外初次收入流量》報告內。用戶可於政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1040005&scode=250）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

Hong Kong's Gross National Income and external primary income flows for the second quarter of 2025,2025-09-12 16:30,2025-09-12 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200491.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (September 12) the preliminary statistics on Hong Kong's Gross National Income (GNI) and related figures for the second quarter of 2025.

  Hong Kong's GNI, which denotes the total income earned by Hong Kong residents from engaging in various economic activities, increased by 5.2% in the second quarter of 2025 over a year earlier to $892.2 billion at current market prices. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP), estimated at $785.2 billion at current market prices in the same quarter, recorded a 3.7% increase over a year earlier. The value of GNI was larger than GDP by $107.0 billion in the second quarter of 2025, which was equivalent to 13.6% of GDP in that quarter, mainly attributable to a net inflow of investment income.

  After netting out the effect of price changes over the same period, Hong Kong's GNI increased by 3.6% in real terms in the second quarter of 2025 over a year earlier. The corresponding GDP in the same quarter increased by 3.1% in real terms.

  Hong Kong's total inflow of primary income, which mainly comprises investment income, estimated at $624.6 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and equivalent to 79.5% of GDP in that quarter, recorded an increase of 4.8% over a year earlier. Meanwhile, total primary income outflow, estimated at $517.6 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and equivalent to 65.9% of GDP in that quarter, also increased by 2.3% over a year earlier.

  As for the major components of investment income inflow, direct investment income (DII) increased by 3.5% over a year earlier, mainly due to the increase in earnings of some prominent local enterprises from their direct investment abroad. Portfolio investment income (PII) recorded a significant increase of 19.4% over a year earlier, mainly attributable to the increase in dividend income received by resident investors from their holdings of non-resident equity securities and the increase in interest income received by resident investors from their holdings of non-resident debt securities.

  Regarding the major components of investment income outflow, DII increased by 3.1% over a year earlier, mainly due to the increase in earnings of some prominent multinational enterprises from their direct investment in Hong Kong. PII increased significantly by 19.6%, mainly attributable to the increase in dividend payout to non-resident investors from their holdings of resident equity securities and the increase in interest payout to non-resident investors from their holdings of resident debt securities.

  Analysed by country/territory, the mainland of China continued to be the largest source of Hong Kong's total primary income inflow in the second quarter of 2025, accounting for 42.3%. This was followed by the British Virgin Islands (BVI), with a share of 12.8%. Regarding total primary income outflow, the mainland of China and the BVI remained the most important destinations in the second quarter of 2025, accounting for 30.5% and 21.8% respectively.

Further information

  GDP and GNI are closely related indicators for measuring economic performance. GDP is a measure of the total value of production of all resident producing units of an economy. GNI denotes the total income earned by residents of an economy from engaging in various economic activities, irrespective of whether the economic activities are carried out within the economic territory of the economy or outside.

  Figures of GNI and primary income flows analysed by income component from the third quarter of 2023 to the second quarter of 2025 are presented in Table A, while selected major country/territory breakdowns of primary income inflow and outflow for the same quarters are presented in Tables B(1) and B(2) respectively.

  Statistics on GDP and GNI from 2023 onwards and primary income flows from 2024 onwards are subject to revision when more data are incorporated.

  More detailed statistics are given in the report ""Gross National Income and External Primary Income Flows, Second Quarter 2025"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1040005&scode=250).

  Compared with the grading released last week, Approach Beach, Big Wave Bay Beach and Silver Mine Bay Beach have been upgraded from Grade 3 to Grade 2. Tai Po Lung Mei Beach has been changed from Grade 1 to Grade 2.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

Note 1: Lifesaving services are provided by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department at 27 gazetted beaches, marked with an asterisk (*) above, from September 1. For details, please refer to the Leisure and Cultural Services Department's Special Announcement (www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/beach/index.html).

German I&T talent visit Hong Kong and Shenzhen to explore opportunities in twin cities (with photos),2025-09-12 16:00,2025-09-12 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200410.htm,"  Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE) arranged for a delegation of German innovation and technology (I&T) talent to visit Hong Kong and Shenzhen from September 9 to 12 to learn about the entrepreneurial ecosystem, industry support and I&T opportunities in both cities. The visit is aimed at attracting German delegation members to pursue development in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).

  The 18-member delegation visited the Hong Kong Science Park, the Shatin Communications and Technology Centre of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Center as well as the Qianhai International Talent Hub in Shenzhen, and exchanged views with representatives from Invest Hong Kong, local start-ups, and Mainland technology enterprises. The delegation also toured various landmarks in Hong Kong to experience the unique charm of Asia's world city.

  When meeting the delegation, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare,Mr Chris Sun, stated that talent and technology are the key engines driving high-quality economic and social development. He highlighted that Hong Kong leapt to fourth place globally and first in Asia in the World Talent Ranking, and that the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster was ranked first globally by the World Intellectual Property Organization, reflecting the high international recognition of Hong Kong's appeal to talent and the GBA's innovation capacity. The Government will continue to promote complementarity and synergy between Hong Kong and other cities in the GBA as well as facilitate the integration of technology and talent with a view to fostering the economic development of Hong Kong and contributing to the impetus of national development.

  Representatives from the German youth entrepreneurship organisation opined that it was exceptionally meaningful for them to establish a connection with the Government, and hoped that they could serve as a bridge between Hong Kong and Germany to enable more German talent to know about Hong Kong and expand into markets outside Europe. Some delegates said that Hong Kong's location at the heart of Asia, as well as its mature financial market and network of business partners with access to the vast markets of the GBA, make it conducive to starting or expanding a business. They found the visit useful in helping them understand the regional I&T ecosystem and said that they hoped to leverage Hong Kong's advantages to explore new opportunities in Asia.

  In June this year, HKTE visited Munich, Germany, and co-organised a pitch event on I&T and entrepreneurship with the local youth entrepreneurship organisation. Twelve winning I&T talents were selected. Mr Sun visited the city to officiate at the prize presentation ceremony and invited the winners, together with representatives from the organisation and judges of the event, to visit Hong Kong and other cities in the GBA.

  As of today, HKTE has completed about 70 outreach visits and hosted more than 170 talent promotional programmes on the Mainland and overseas. The office will enhance its external promotion, in consonance with the development of the eight centres, to recruit more global talent with diverse backgrounds, and provide comprehensive support services to assist incoming talent in integrating into Hong Kong, building the city into an international hub for high-calibre talent."

一行十八人的訪問團先後參觀香港科學園、香港賽馬會沙田通訊及科技中心、香港科技大學創業中心和深圳前海國際人才港，並跟投資推廣署代表、本地初創企業及內地科技企業交流。其間亦遊覽多個香港地標，感受亞洲國際都會的獨特魅力。

勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡與訪問團會面時指出，人才和科技是驅動經濟和社會高質量發展的核心動力，香港在世界人才排名躍升至全球第四位及亞洲首位，「深圳—香港—廣州」創新集群獲世界知識產權組織評為全球第一，反映香港對人才的吸引力及大灣區的創新能力在國際上獲得高度肯定。特區政府會繼續推動香港與其他大灣區城市的優勢互補，促進科技與人才融合，助力香港經濟發展，貢獻國家發展動能。

德國青年創業組織代表認為，與特區政府建立聯繫極具意義，期望能成為連接香港與德國的橋樑，讓更多德國人才認識香港，開拓歐洲以外的市場。多位訪問團成員指出，香港位處亞洲中心，擁有成熟的金融市場和企業夥伴網絡，背靠大灣區的龐大市場，有利創業或擴展業務，是次考察有助了解區內創科生態，期望藉着香港的優勢，發掘亞洲新機遇。

今年六月，人才辦訪問德國慕尼黑，聯同當地青年創業組織合辦創科創業提案大賽，選出12名得獎創科人才。孫玉菡到訪當地擔任頒獎嘉賓，並邀請他們與組織代表和活動評審前往香港及其他大灣區城市考察。

人才辦至今已完成超過70次外訪，在海內外舉辦超過170 場人才推廣活動，未來將加強對外宣傳，配合「八大中心」發展，招攬更多國際多元人才，並提供全方位支援服務，協助來港人才融入香港，打造香港成為國際高端人才集聚高地。"

DH to commence territory-wide Population Health Survey in September,2025-09-12 15:50,2025-09-12 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200352.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced today (September 12) that the territory-wide Population Health Survey (PHS) 2025/26 will begin on September 18. The PHS aims to collect pertinent information on the health status and lifestyles of the local population in order to update and enrich the Government's database on population health. The latest information will enable the Government to formulate evidence-based public health policies, allocate resources effectively, and develop public health services and programmes tailored to the needs of the local community.

This marks the fourth large-scale territory-wide survey of its kind since 2003. The survey includes a questionnaire and a health examination, targeting land-based non-institutionalised Hong Kong residents aged 15 or above. The DH will randomly select about 20 000 individuals to represent their households for the questionnaire. Among them, around 1 800 will be invited to undergo a free health examination to provide further health data.

The survey identifies trends in specific health conditions, informing the development of health promotion activities and disease prevention strategies. By participating in the survey, citizens can gain insights into their own health and its connection to lifestyle habits, promoting greater awareness of health and encouraging the adoption of healthy lifestyles, thereby contributing to the improvement of public health in the long run.

Questionnaire can be completed online or via household interview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Selected households will receive an invitation letter by post. Household representatives may choose to complete the questionnaire themselves through an online platform or the eHealth App. Alternatively, the DH can arrange for an interviewer to visit the household and assist with completing the questionnaire. In addition to household data and sociodemographic characteristics, the questionnaire covers a range of health information, including physical and mental health status, health behaviour and preventive health practices.

During the face-to-face interview, to assist household members to build a lifelong and comprehensive personal electronic health record, enable healthcare professionals to provide them with continuous healthcare services, and enable them to manage their own and their family members' health records through the eHealth App, the interviewer will assist them to register with eHealth. Moreover, with the consent of the respondents, the DH will deposit the completed questionnaires into their ""Personal Folder"" in eHealth, enabling them to retain and utilise relevant health information.

Free health examination
---------------------------

The DH will select around 1 800 respondents aged between 15 and 84 from those who have completed the questionnaires to undergo a free health examination at designated health examination centres. The examination includes physical measurements (weight, height, hip and waist circumference, and blood pressure) and testing (lipid profile, glycated haemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, haemoglobin, iron status, inflammatory markers, viral hepatitis, as well as sodium, potassium, creatinine and iodine in urine).

Respondents who completed the health examination will receive their laboratory reports. The DH will provide advice and referral letters to those with abnormal test results. The test reports will also be deposited in their personal eHealth accounts, enabling them to seek appropriate follow ups and treatment from their family doctors or district health centres.

All information will be kept strictly confidential
----------------------------------------------------

The data collected in the survey will be used solely for research and statistical purposes. Findings will be published in aggregate form. All personal data and contact information will be kept strictly confidential.

To prevent fraudsters, the DH reminds the public to pay attention to the following anti-fraud measures:

1. Only those who have received an invitation letter from the DH by post and have activated the online questionnaire will receive SMS or email notifications about the PHS.

SMS: The DH will only send SMS related to the PHS 2025/26 using the sender IDs ""#DH-PHS2025"" or ""#DH-PHS"". Members of the public should remain highly vigilant if they receive SMS from senders not starting with ""#"" or displaying a regular phone number.
Email: The DH will only send emails related to the PHS 2025/26 from the e-mail address ""noreply@ehr.gov.hk"".

2. All interviewers will wear a specific vest uniform and carry an ""Interviewer Identity Card"" issued by the DH for verification. If in doubt, the public may call the survey hotline (3900 1194) between 9am and 10pm daily to verify the identity of the interviewer.
3. Neither the DH nor the interviewers will ask members of the public for any bank account numbers or credit card information. They will not request money transfers in relation to this survey either.

Active participation will help improve public health policies
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The DH urged invited citizens to participate in the survey to help establish a representative database. This will enhance Hong Kong's public health policies and services, thereby better safeguarding the health of Hong Kong people.

自二○○三年，是次人口健康調查為第四次同類型大規模全港性調查。調查分為問卷和身體檢查兩部分，對象為15歲或以上、陸上非住院的香港居民。衞生署會隨機抽選約二萬人代表其住戶單位進行問卷調查，當中約1 800人會獲邀接受免費身體檢查，以提供進一步的健康數據。

調查結果有助於識別特定健康問題的流行趨勢，並指導健康推廣活動和疾病預防策略的制定。透過參與調查，市民能更了解自身健康狀況及其與生活習慣的關係，促進他們對健康的重視，還可鼓勵更多人採取健康的生活方式，從而長遠改善社會的整體健康水平。

調查以網上問卷或住戶訪問進行
——————————————

獲選中的住戶單位將接獲以郵寄方式發送的邀請信。住戶代表可選擇自行填寫網上問卷、通過醫健通流動應用程式填寫問卷或預約安排訪問員進行家訪和代為填寫問卷。除住戶資料和社會人口特徵外，問卷亦涵蓋一系列健康資料，包括身體、心理和社交健康狀況、生活習慣，以及疾病預防措施等。

會面訪問期間，訪問員會協助住戶登記醫健通，以建立一個終身和全面的個人電子健康紀錄檔案，便利醫護人員為他們提供具連貫性的醫療服務，並可透過醫健通流動應用程式更方便地管理自己和家人的健康。此外，衞生署在獲得受訪者同意後會將完成的問卷存入其醫健通的「個人資料夾」，以便受訪者保存和運用相關健康資料。

免費身體檢查

衞生署會在完成問卷的人士中，抽選約1 800名年齡介乎15至84歲人士到指定體檢中心，接受免費身體檢查。檢查項目包括體格檢查（體重、身高、臀圍、腰圍和血壓）和化驗檢測（血脂概況、糖化血紅素、空腹血糖、血色素、鐵質水平、炎症指數、病毒性肝炎，以及尿液中的鈉、鉀、肌酸酐和碘）。

完成身體檢查的受訪者將獲發還完整的化驗報告。衞生署會為檢測結果異常的人士提供建議及轉介信，檢測報告亦會存入至其個人醫健通戶口，以便他們到家庭醫生或地區康健中心作適當跟進和治療。

所有資料絕對保密
————————

調查所搜集的資料只會用於研究和統計用途，而調查結果只會以整體形式發放，所有個人和聯絡資料將會嚴加保密。

Speech by FS at Digital Entertainment Leadership Forum 2025 (English only) (with photos),2025-09-12 14:55,2025-09-12 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200545.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Digital Entertainment Leadership Forum 2025 today (September 12):

Simon (Chairman of the Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, Mr Simon Chan), Rocky (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, Dr Rocky Cheng), æ¥å¥èé· (Director of the Department of Youth Affairs of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Yang Jian), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you once again at the Digital Entertainment Leadership Forum. Over the past few years, this Forum has firmly established itself as Hong Kong’s premier digital entertainment event, and one of the most influential platforms of its kind in Asia. It brings together industry leaders, creators, innovators and members of the public for a vibrant and stimulating exchange of ideas, also showcasing a rich tapestry of local and global innovations that are shaping the future of digital entertainment.

   ""AI-charged Adventure"" is a most fitting theme for the Forum this year. AI is a transformative force for nearly every aspect of our lives. In the realm of digital entertainment, AI is revolutionising the way we create and experience content. From automated scriptwriting and music composition, to smarter NPCs (non-playable characters) and ultra-realistic visuals in games, AI is speeding up production, lowering costs and delivering more personalised content that responds to user preferences. For instance, in the popular game ""Black Myth: Wukong"" (ãé»ç¥è©±ï¼æç©ºã), AI played a pivotal role in its production.

  Indeed, the opportunity is immense. Estimates suggest that in 2024, revenues in the global entertainment and media industry stood at around US$3 trillion, and will grow to US$3.5 trillion in 2029. AI is a key driver behind this. It is transforming content delivery models, lowering barriers to entry, curating new user experiences, and enabling more targeted and effective advertising.

  However, alongside these opportunities come important and timely questions. In a world increasingly shaped by AI, are we relying more - or less - on human ingenuity? Can we ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically? How do we guard against algorithmic bias, deepfakes and digital scams? And how do we protect intellectual property rights in the AI era?

  Addressing these questions requires thoughtful dialogue and collaboration across sectors. That is why forums like this one are so important. It provides a platform where stakeholders come together to explore opportunities and address challenges. I very much look forward to the insights and ideas arising from this forum, as distinguished speakers share their perspectives across a wide range of topics in this dynamic space.

  For our part, the Government is committed to driving innovation by AI. We have prioritised AI as a core industry, advancing on five fronts: data, algorithms, computing power, capital and talent. Cyberport is a key partner in this effort. It is home to Hong Kong’s AI Supercomputing Centre, and plays a vital role in supporting start-ups and fostering cross-sector innovation. Meanwhile, we are also keen to apply AI in our creative industries. A good example is the ""Future Animation"" programme launched by our Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency. This initiative supports local creative companies in using AI to produce short animations. Some of the works have good potential to be developed into full-length features.

  Ultimately, the success of Hong Kong’s digital entertainment sector comes down to people. It is the imagination, creativity and pursuit of excellence by the professionals in the industry that will drive us forward. To support this endeavour, Hong Kong will maintain an environment that is open and welcoming to talent from around the world - whether they are producers, artists, innovators, engineers or entrepreneurs. Together, we will build an even more vibrant digital entertainment ecosystem.

  Ladies and gentlemen, with the Government’s proactive support, a thriving creative community, and the collaborative spirit displayed here, Hong Kong is ready to embark on an exciting new adventure in digital entertainment. Every breakthrough, every innovation, will be another piece in the puzzle that unlocks new possibilities. Let us explore the uncharted territories, connect the dots, and build a future where creativity and technology shine hand in hand.

  I wish you all an inspiring and rewarding forum, and the best of health and entertainment. Thank you."

大灣區藝術展覽系列「水墨異重奏」--「疊境雙生」在廣州舉行（附圖）,2025-09-12 14:30,2025-09-12 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200263.htm,"康樂及文化事務署（康文署）轄下藝術推廣辦事處與深圳市前沿藝穗藝術中心共同籌劃的大灣區藝術展覽系列「水墨異重奏」，第三場展覽「疊境雙生」，由今日（九月十二日）至十月二十六日在廣州舉行，亦是第五屆粵港澳大灣區文化藝術節響應節目之一。香港藝術家邱榮豐以水墨為媒介，重塑傳統山水的境象，而另一個大灣區藝術家組合_.WAV_Studio_（曹雨西及劉曉江）通過數字技術，構建奇幻的山水世界。他們以不同媒介，打破傳統水墨藝術的時空和維度。

邱榮豐專注於水墨創作和研究。他的水墨作品如《Meta-5》、《Into V》、《回聲之上》和《山踪》，呈現不同的山水景色。另一水墨作品《蜃曲》，透過意象化的手法，把香港十八區具代表性的山島轉化為山水畫面。《山外山02》水墨裝置則通過全景式構圖，將香港南北兩邊的無人島，連綴成一道流動的山水境象。裝置的環形結構讓參觀者穿梭其間，透過多角度與距離的變化，體驗山水中移步換景的視覺和空間體驗。作品《軌》展示邱榮豐在黑暗環境，利用光軌記錄剪裁成圓塊的砂紙，在渲染水墨紙張上研磨的痕跡。

_.WAV_Studio_的作品涵蓋影片、裝置、互動和聲音藝術。《人工智能山水圖》系列透過學習數萬幅水墨作品，訓練出可無限生成的「山水繪畫機器」，同時借助三維物理模擬，帶來如「裸眼3D」般的沉浸體驗。《富春山居圖》把具備掃描功能的二維碼，轉化為可閱讀的山水景觀。《四時比鄰》系列把花木、岩石、水體與光影片段動態生成虛擬圖景，引導參觀者思考如何在算法與數據中重建對自然的感知。《高山流水經緯圖》則實時捕捉大灣區的山形脈絡，動態生成數碼山水。

展覽同時展出_.WAV_Studio與邱榮豐共同創作的《人工智能山水圖——邱榮豐聯合創作特別版》影片裝置。作品靈感源自邱榮豐的原作《千迴02》，其畫面張力與《人工智能山水圖》系列所呈現的「動態質感」高度契合，仿佛是算法生成影像中凝固的一瞬，顯示傳統筆墨與數字生成藝術互相映照。

展覽得到chi K11藝術空間的場地支持，於廣州市天河區珠江東路6號K11購物藝術中心四樓chi K11藝術空間舉行，免費入場。有關展覽詳情，可瀏覽藝術推廣辦事處網頁www.apo.hk/tc/web/apo/there_ink_art_ensembles_strata_and_symbiosis.html，和追蹤「距地藝術」Facebook專頁www.facebook.com/apo.there、Instagram專頁www.instagram.com/apo.there及微博專頁weibo.com/apothere。

"""Ink Art Ensembles"" Exhibition Series in the Greater Bay Area - ""Strata and Symbiosis"" staged in Guangzhou (with photos)",2025-09-12 14:30,2025-09-12 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091200265.htm,"  Jointly organised by the Art Promotion Office under the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) and the Shenzhen Fringe Art Center, the third exhibition ""Strata and Symbiosis"" of the ""Ink Art Ensembles"" Exhibition Series in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) is on display from today (September 12) to October 26 in Guangzhou. It is also a contribution programme of the 5th Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Culture and Arts Festival. Hong Kong artist Ross Yau uses ink as a medium to reshape the imagery of traditional landscapes, while another GBA art group, _.WAV_Studio_(Cao Yuxi and Lau Hiu-kong), has created a fantastical landscape world through digital technology. Through different media, they break the temporal and spatial dimensions of traditional ink art.

 Yau focuses on ink creations and research. His ink artworks, such as ""Meta-5"", ""Into V"", ""Beyond the Echoes"", and ""The Trail of the Mountains"", reveal varied landscapes. Another ink artwork, ""Mirage Harmony"", metaphorically reconstructs the distinctive landforms of Hong Kong's 18 districts into a pictorial landscape. The ink art installation ""Mountains Beyond II"" constructs a cyclical landscape, connecting uninhabited islands from Hong Kong's southern and northern sides through a monumental composition. The circular installation allows viewers to walk through its space, engaging with shifting perspectives and distances to emulate the visual and spatial experience of scenery transforming with every step. His artwork ""Tracing"" shows traces left by a piece of sandpaper in a round shape rubbing against a sheet of ink-coloured paper through light trails in the dark.

 The artworks of _.WAV_Studio_ encompass video, installation, interactive and sound art. The series ""Shanshui by AI"" trains a ""landscape painting machine"" capable of infinite generation with tens of thousands of ink paintings, and makes use of three-dimensional physical simulation to create an immersive experience like ""glasses-free 3D"". ""Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains"" reinterprets the scannable QR code, transforming it into a readable landscape. The series ""Seasonal Proximities"" turns footage of flowers, trees, rocks, water bodies, and light and shadow into digital images, guiding viewers to consider how to rebuild perceptions of nature through algorithms and data. ""Longitude and Latitude Chart of High Mountains and Flowing Water"" captures real-time mountain terrain of the GBA to dynamically generate digital landscapes.

 The exhibition also displays a digital video installation co-created by _.WAV_Studio_ and Yau named ""Shanshui by AI - A Special Collaboration with Ross YAU Wing Fung"". It was inspired by Yau's original work ""Pouring II"". The visual tension in the artwork aligns seamlessly with the ""dynamic texture"" of the ""Shanshui by AI"" series, appearing frozen in time through algorithmically generated imagery. It shows traditional brushwork resonating with digitally generated art.

 The exhibition has venue support from chi K11 art space and is running at chi K11 art space at L4, Guangzhou K11 Art Mall (6 Zhujiang East Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou) with free admission. For details of the exhibition, please visit the website of the Art Promotion Office: www.apo.hk/en/web/apo/there_ink_art_ensembles_strata_and_symbiosis.html, and follow the ""apothere"" page on Facebook www.facebook.com/apo.there, Instagramwww.instagram.com/apo.there and Weibo weibo.com/apothere.

 The exhibition is also one of the activities in the Chinese Culture Promotion Series. The LCSD has long been promoting Chinese history and culture through organising an array of programmes and activities to enable the public to learn more about the broad and profound Chinese culture.

The red tide was spotted by staff of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) on September 10 at the waters in Sha Tin Hoi. The red tide still persists, and no associated fish deaths have been reported as of today.

A spokesman for the working group said, ""The red tide was formed by Pseudo-nitzschia calliantha, which is not common in Hong Kong waters. According to literature overseas, the algal species might produce toxin. However, no such reports have been recorded in Hong Kong so far.""

The AFCD urged mariculturists at Yim Tin Tsai, Yim Tin Tsai (East), Yung Shue Au and Lo Fu Wat fish culture zones to monitor the situation closely and increase aeration where necessary.

Red tide is a natural phenomenon. The AFCD's proactive phytoplankton monitoring programme will continue to monitor red tide occurrences to minimise the impact on the mariculture industry and the public."

邱國鼎在致辭中表示：「此合作約章為各界協作奠定了堅實基礎，透過制訂及更新《香港鐵路標準》，將帶領香港鐵路建設邁向新里程。」他指，國家鐵路標準不僅達到世界標準，更在多個領域處於全球領先地位。《香港鐵路標準》的制訂與更新，將積極參考包括國家在內的世界級鐵路規範，廣泛吸收國內外最佳實踐。透過引入內地的設計標準、建築物料、裝備及施工規範，從而善用內地施工模式、技術及資源於鐵路建設以奠定基礎。此舉不僅有助促進本地建造業引進內地的創新機械和建築技術，還能提升效率，縮短工期並降低成本。

他補充，香港標準一直與國際標準接軌，期望新的《香港鐵路標準》不僅能成為大灣區標準，更旨在成為新的世界標準之一。

該標準將首先適用於目前正在推展中的北環線及港深西部鐵路（洪水橋至前海）項目，日後亦會逐步推展到其他鐵路項目。

約章三項承諾包括：

1. 支持制訂及推出新版《香港鐵路標準》，並應用於鐵路項目；
2. 推動《香港鐵路標準》的持續優化和應用；及
3. 以《香港鐵路標準》為關鍵支柱，建設卓越的鐵路項目。

為配合上述目標及精簡流程，路政署將獲屋宇署透過《建築物條例》（第123章）授權，成立專責小組處理新鐵路項目的審批工作。路政署亦正與包括屋宇署、土木工程拓展署、渠務署、機電工程署、消防處、香港警務處和運輸署在內的相關政府部門積極協作，引入電子審批平台，實現文件提交、評論與審批的全數碼集中處理，從而優化整個審批流程，目標是將現時審批時間縮減一半，在嚴格保障安全及品質的前提下，顯著提升新鐵路項目的推展效率。"

The ceremony was officiated by the Director of Highways, Mr Tony Yau. Mainland and overseas railway experts, representatives from relevant government departments (namely the Buildings Department (BD), the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD), Drainage Services Department (DSD), the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD), the Fire Services Department (FSD), the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Transport Department (TD)), the Building Technology Research Institute, as well as the MTR Corporation Limited joined as signatories.

  Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Yau remarked, ""This Collaboration Charter has established a solid foundation for cross-sector collaboration. Through the formulation and updating of the Hong Kong Railway Standards, it would lead Hong Kong's railway construction to create a new milestone."" He said that the nation's railway standards not only attain international benchmarks, but also take a leading position internationally in various aspects. The formulation and updating of the Hong Kong Railway Standards would actively draw reference to world-class railway specifications including those of the nation, and extensively absorb the best practices of the Mainland and overseas. By introducing the Mainland's design standards, building materials, equipment and construction specifications, a firm basis will be established for utilising the Mainland's construction methods, technologies and resources in railway construction. This would not only help to promote introduction of the Mainland's innovative machinery and building technologies by the local construction industry, but also enhance efficiency, shorten the construction period and reduce costs.

  He added that Hong Kong's standards have long aligned with international standards, and envisioned that the new Hong Kong Railway Standards would not only become the ""Greater Bay Area Standards"", but also aim to become one of the new ""World Standards"".

  The standards will first be applicable to the ongoing Northern Link project and the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link (Hung Shui Kiu-Qianhai) project, and will be progressively adopted in other railway projects.

  The three commitments of the Charter are:

1. support the formulation and launch of the new Hong Kong Railway Standards for application to railway projects;
2. drive the continuous enhancement and application of the Hong Kong Railway Standards; and
3. leverage the Hong Kong Railway Standards as a key pillar for pursuing excellence in building railway projects.

  To support the above objectives and streamline processing, the HyD would be authorised by the BD under the Buildings Ordinance (Cap.â¯123) to handle the approval process for new railway projects by setting up a dedicated team. The HyD is also actively collaborating with relevant government departments, including the BD, the CEDD, the DSD, the EMSD, the FSD, the HKPF and the TD, to introduce a digitalised approval platform for materialising the handling of the submission, review and approve of documents in a fully digital centralised manner, with a view to streamlining the current approval processing time by half, while significantly enhancing the efficiency of implementing new railway projects under strict assurance of safety and quality.

Chris (Founder & CEO of ReThink HK & The ReThink Foundation, Mr Chris Brown), Simon (Chief Executive Officer of Business Environment Council, Mr Simon Ng), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is a huge privilege to address you at ReThink HK 2025, part of our Hong Kong Green Week 2025 and a leading platform for sustainable business. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to ReThink for its visionary ""Innovating for Impact"" programme, which harnesses green technology, AI and also data to drive sustainability. This initiative resonates deeply with the Government's commitment to leveraging technologies to achieve our carbon neutrality goal by 2050, for example through innovations in sustainable energy, buildings and climate solutions. Your collective efforts - participants, partners and stakeholders - are pivotal in advancing our shared environmental, social and governance (ESG) ambitions, setting the stage for a transformative journey towards a greener future.

Aligning with national and local Sustainability Goals

This journey is guided by a clear vision from the Central People's Government, as outlined in the 14th Five-Year Plan, which targets a peak in carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Hong Kong is also fully committed and we are pledging to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050 and reduce carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2035. These ambitious targets are not just aspirations but a call to action, driving us to lead by example in sustainable development. To realise this vision, we are leveraging our strengths as a global financial hub to pioneer innovative financing solutions, seamlessly connecting our environmental goals with our financial expertise.

Pioneering green finance in Asia

Building on this foundation, Hong Kong has solidified its position as Asia's premier green finance hub. Last year, our green and sustainable debt market surpassed US$84 billion, with green bonds alone contributing US$43 billion, securing 45 per cent of the regional market and maintaining our leadership as Asia's top green bond market for the seventh consecutive year since 2018. This financial prowess enables us to fund transformative projects that align with our carbon neutrality objectives.

Under the Government Sustainable Bond Programme, we have issued green bonds totaling HK$240 billion since May 2019. Milestones include the world's largest retail green bond back in 2022, Asia's largest multi-currency ESG bond in 2023, the first tokenised government green bond in 2023, and the world's first multi-tranche digitally native green bonds in 2024. These initiatives have supported 116 local green projects, with the forthcoming 2025 Green Bond Report, due this month, providing transparent insights into their environmental impact.

Complementing this, the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme, also launched by the Government, extended to 2027, has disbursed over HK$370 million to support over 600 green and sustainable debt instruments, with a total issuance exceeding HK$1.3 trillion. These efforts not only drive decarbonisation but also reinforce Hong Kong's role as a global leader in transition financing, bridging our sustainability goals with innovative financing.

Empowering talent for a sustainable future

To sustain this momentum, we recognise that innovation in particular requires skilled talent. Our three-year Pilot Green and Sustainable Finance Capacity Building Support Scheme provides subsidies of up to HK$10,000 for practitioners, students and graduates to develop expertise in green finance. Over 7 600 applications across 95 eligible programmes have been approved, with HK$42 million reimbursed. By extending this scheme to 2028, we are ensuring a robust pipeline of talent to drive our green finance agenda forward. This investment in human capital directly supports the innovative financing models that underpin our green bond initiatives and sets the stage for technological advancements in sustainability.

Fostering green fintech innovation

Technology is critical in terms of being an enabler of this vision, and Hong Kong is at the very forefront of integrating financial technology with green finance. The Hong Kong Green FinTech Map 2025, launched in June 2025 by our Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group, builds on last year's prototype to enhance the visibility of green fintech companies. Right now, we have more than 60 of those companies as the potential partners to work with ReThink going forward. Additionally, the Green and Sustainable Fintech Proof-of-Concept Funding Support Scheme, launched in June last year, provides subsidies to technology companies and research institutes. With 39 applicants and 60 projects approved, this initiative fosters collaboration and innovation, echoing ReThink's focus on AI and green technology. These fintech advancements enhance the efficiency and scalability of our green finance initiatives, creating a dynamic ecosystem that drives sustainable progress.

Ensuring transparency in sustainability

Transparency is the cornerstone of this ecosystem, ensuring trust and accountability. In March last year, we published a vision statement for a comprehensive sustainability disclosure ecosystem. The Hong Kong Sustainability Disclosure Standards, issued in December last year by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and also fully aligned with ISSB Standards(International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure Standards), became effective in August this year, ensuring global consistency in reporting. Also, the Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure mandates publicly accountable entities to adopt the ISSB standards by 2028, while the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, covering 12 economic activities, standardises green classification to reduce greenwashing risks. Phase 2 development has commenced under which the scope of sectors and economic activities will be expanded to introduce transition activities and add new green activities. These disclosure and classification systems provide the clarity needed to attract investment and support the innovative financing models driving our green bond and fintech initiatives.

Broadening access and engagement

To ensure inclusivity in our sustainability efforts, we are enhancing market accessibility. In February last year, in collaboration with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, which is also a partner of ReThink, we launched free greenhouse gas emissions calculation tools, empowering small and medium enterprises to manage their environmental impact. Additionally, the HKEX (Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited)'s Core Climate platform, the only international carbon marketplace offering HKD and RMB (Renminbi) settlement, attracted 100 participants by the end of last year. Partnerships with Mainland China's Beijing and Shenzhen Green Exchanges further strengthen regional collaboration, aligning with our taxonomy and disclosure frameworks to foster a dynamic carbon market. These initiatives broadened access to sustainability tools, ensuring that all sectors can contribute to our shared goals, much like the collaborative spirit of ReThink's ""Innovating for Impact"" programme.

A unified call to action

Hong Kong's leadership in green finance is a testament to our ability to unite vision, innovation and collaboration. ReThink HK 2025's focus on AI, green technology and data mirrors our commitment to leveraging cutting-edge solutions to achieve a sustainable future. From our ambitious carbon neutrality targets to our pioneering green bonds, fintech innovations and transparent disclosure systems, every step along the way we take as the interconnected step to build a resilient and inclusive ecosystem. I urge all of you to join us in translating this vision into action, harnessing the power of innovation to create a greener, more sustainable Hong Kong and beyond together.

Thank you."

EPD responds to Ombudsman's direct investigation report,2025-09-12 11:12,2025-09-12 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091100550.htm,"  The Office of the Ombudsman today (September 12) released a report on its direct investigation into the illegal disposal problem and the ""HoHoSkips"" recycling service for construction waste.

  A spokesperson for the Environmental Protection Department (EPD)said, ""The Department's efforts in combating the illegal disposal of construction waste in recent years have shown significant results. The amount of illegally disposed construction waste cleared by the Government has significantly decreased from the peak of around 9 000 tonnes in 2017 to about 1 000 tonnes between 2022 and 2024 (see Annex), representing a reduction of about 89 per cent. In some previous illegal disposal blackspots, such as the areas around Arran Street in Mong Kok and Wang Wo Tsai Street in Tsuen Wan, the reduction in the amount of illegally disposed construction waste has even exceeded 90 per cent.""

  The Office has recognised the EPD's efforts and effectiveness in combating the illegal disposal of construction waste, as well as its use of smart technology to assist law enforcement. The report suggested a series of measures to further enhance the effectiveness of combating the illegal disposal of construction waste and the ""HoHoSkips"" service.

  The EPD expressed its appreciation for the suggestions and will actively follow up in five directions, namely, reviewing ways to strengthen enforcement against illegal disposal of construction waste; strengthening promotional efforts on proper handling of construction waste; reviewing and enhancing the ""HoHoSkips"" service to increase efficiency, including the expansion of the ""Smart HoHoSkips"" recycling service; optimising the ""HoHoSkips"" mobile application and webpage; and collecting feedback from users to improve the ""HoHoSkips"" service.

  The EPD will continue to regularly review the operational data of the surveillance camera systems and related intelligence, and flexibly adjust the system distribution. It will also continue to deploy law enforcement actions and carry out promotional activities in areas with frequent small-scale renovation works and building maintenance activities, aiming to strengthen deterrence, improve enforcement efficiency and increase prosecution success rates. Moreover, the EPD has already initiated follow-up actions with the respective recycling organisation to implement enhancement measures for the ""HoHoSkips"" service as soon as possible to improve users' experience."

​申訴專員公署公布就非法棄置建築廢物問題及「好好斗」回收服務的主動調查行動報告（附圖）,2025-09-12 11:00,2025-09-12 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091100734.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（九月十二日）宣布完成非法棄置建築廢物問題及「好好斗」回收服務的主動調查行動，並向環境保護署（環保署）提出共15項改善建議。

建築工程和一般裝修工程均會產生不少建築廢物。當局自二○○六年起實施建築廢物處置收費計劃，建築廢物產生者須繳交廢物處置費用，並有責任妥善處置建築廢物。然而，公署留意到，不時有傳媒報道及市民投訴有建築廢物被胡亂棄置在公眾地方，有關違法行為對市民及道路使用者構成不便及安全隱患，亦影響環境衞生。為此，環保署以多管齊下的措施打擊非法棄置建築廢物的問題，並於二○二一年二月推出先導計劃，為市民及中小型裝修工程業界提供有效益的建築廢物收集途徑。市民及業界可透過「好好斗」流動應用程式，預約由回收基金資助的回收機構，妥善處理建築廢物。

公署調查發現，經過環保署多年來努力不懈，包括加裝監察攝錄系統、成立航拍機隊、加強巡查、與其他部門協調及訂立優先處理地點名單以加強監察等，以及現屆政府着力增加打擊力度並於二○二三年將定額罰款金額由1,500元大幅提高至6,000元，政府近年清理的非法棄置建築廢物數量已由二○一七年的9 000公噸大幅下降至二○二二年至二○二四年的每年約1 000公噸，經環保署核實的非法棄置建築廢物個案數目亦從二○二二年的4 612宗下降38%至二○二四年的2 841宗，反映當局的工作取得相當成效，值得充分肯定。

陳積志表示︰「街道上堆積非法棄置的建築廢物一直是市民關注的問題。我注意到近年有關情況有明顯改善，顯示當局的工作具實質成效，而『好好斗』回收服務計劃的使用率去年亦增加至76%，有更多市民使用該服務處置建築廢物。」

公署主動調查行動中發現，市民就非法棄置建築廢物的相關投訴仍維持每年一千多宗。在投訴個案中，經環保署核實的非法棄置建築廢物個案由近年的五、六百宗增加至二○二四年接近800宗。此外，公署人員在實地視察及跟隨環保署人員行動時，不難發現街上確有被棄置的建築廢物。資料亦顯示，二○一九年至二○二四年期間，環保署平均每年提出約102宗檢控個案；即使以檢控宗數最多的二○一九年來計算，該年度的檢控率仍只有3.8%。由此可見，環保署就非法棄置建築廢物個案的檢控率極低。公署認為，為進一步打擊非法棄置建築廢物的違法行為，環保署應檢視如何進一步加強執法及蒐證效能。

就「好好斗」回收服務計劃方面，根據環保署資料，二○二三年的服務使用率為62.5%，但同時該年有27.8%的申請被取消是因回收機構在高峰時段的服務供不應求所致，可見當時服務計劃的運作規劃及資源分配未能完全配合服務使用者的實際需要。在公署展開調查後，環保署已就服務的預約申請程序作出改善，讓用戶得悉某時段的預約量是否已滿，並顯示可供預約的時段供其考慮。

回收機構在二○二四年提供的收集服務比二○二三年增加了1 062次，服務使用率亦上升至76%，而在二○二四年因回收機構日程已滿而取消的預約申請的百分比亦下跌至12.1%，顯示「好好斗」回收服務的資源運用情況在最近有顯著改善。從二○二四年增加的收集服務次數及使用率可見，市民對「好好斗」回收服務計劃的需求持續。公署認為，環保署應計劃在新回收機構接手後，適時檢視「好好斗」的服務使用率，並研究如何更善用資源，包括壓縮整體個案的平均處理時間，以進一步提高「好好斗」服務的可服務次數，令公帑得以善用及更多服務使用者受惠。公署亦建議環保署密切留意「好好斗」回收服務的需求變化，若服務需求持續上升，便應考慮增加回收車數量及人手以應付增加的需求。

陳積志表示︰「雖然當局處理非法棄置建築廢物的工作有成效，但環保署的極低檢控率、經環保署核實的非法棄置建築廢物投訴個案不跌反升、『好好斗』回收服務的實際數據等顯示，該署的執管效能及檢控、『好好斗』回收服務的運作及程序等，均有可改善之處。公署期望環保署繼續加強執管、改善『好好斗』回收服務計劃的運作及服務供求情況，務求更有效打擊問題及善用資源。」

公署向環保署提出的主要改善建議包括：


應檢視如何進一步加強執法及蒐證效能，例如利用更多及更高科技協助及優化蒐證工作、靈活調配人手進行針對性巡查和突擊行動等，以提升檢控率及阻嚇力；
應考慮在有較大機會出現違法行為的地方，如區內新落成的屋苑，及進行維修或翻新工程的大廈和店鋪附近，針對性地加強巡查和監察，以收重點打擊之效；
聯同「好好斗」回收服務計劃的回收機構探討如何將高峰時段的服務需求轉移至非高峰時段的其他可行方法；
計劃在新回收機構接手後，適時檢視「好好斗」的服務使用率，並研究如何更善用資源，以提高高峰時段可服務的次數，並減少申請被取消的情況；
應與回收機構研究如何壓縮整體個案的平均處理時間，例如更有效地規劃收集路線，以縮短每宗個案所需的交通時間，從而提高資源的運用效率，得以處理更多的回收申請；並分析以往預約申請的地區分佈，考慮可否在通常較多預約申請的地區提供定點定時的收集服務；
密切留意「好好斗」回收服務計劃的需求變化，若服務需求持續上升，應考慮增加回收車數量及相關人手以應付增加的需求，特別是較易在路邊停泊的小型客貨車的數量；
應考慮主動聯絡「好好斗」服務使用者及業界，或在「好好斗」流動應用程式加入收集使用者意見的功能，收集有用意見以改善服務；
應檢視及改善「好好斗」流動應用程式的「使用者守則」及有關計劃網頁的內容，添加使用者須注意的其他重要事項，包括說明取消預約申請的後果，以減少預約申請被取消的情況，亦有助使用者正確及暢順地使用回收服務；以及
應提醒及監督回收機構盡早就涉及服務變更的資訊於網頁及流動應用程式作出通知，以減低對服務使用者的影響。


公署欣悉環保署接納公署提出的所有改善建議。

The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (September 12) announced the completion of a direct investigation operation into the illegal disposal of construction waste and the ""HoHoSkips"" recycling service, with 15 improvement recommendations made to the Environmental Protection Department (EPD).

Construction works and general renovation works inevitably generate a considerable amount of construction waste. Under the Construction Waste Disposal Charging Scheme implemented since 2006, construction waste producers are required to pay for waste disposal and have a duty to dispose of waste properly. Nevertheless, there have been media reports and public complaints from time to time about illegal disposal of construction waste in public places. Such illegal activities not only cause inconvenience and safety hazards for the public and road users but also affect environmental hygiene. In this connection, the EPD has adopted multipronged measures against illegal disposal of construction waste. In February 2021, it also launched a pilot scheme to provide the public and small-to-medium renovators with an effective way for collection of construction waste. Through the ""HoHoSkips"" mobile application, members of the public and the trade can book the service of the recycler subsidised by the Recycling Fund for proper disposal of construction waste.

The Office's investigation revealed that the EPD has spared no effort over the years which included the installation of surveillance camera systems, establishment of a drone fleet, enhanced patrolling, collaboration with other departments, and compilation of a list of priority sites for reinforced surveillance. Coupled with the current-term Government's more stringent enforcement and hiking the fixed penalty from $1,500 to $6,000 in 2023, the quantity of illegally disposed construction waste cleared by the Government dropped substantially from 9 000 tonnes in 2017 to around 1 000 tonnes per year between 2022 and 2024. The number of illegal disposal cases confirmed by the EPD fell by 38 per cent, from 4 612 cases in 2022 to 2 841 cases in 2024. These figures reflect the substantive results of the enforcement efforts of the Administration, which are certainly commendable.

Mr Chan said, ""The illegal disposal of construction waste on the roadside has been a problem widely concerned by the public. I notice the marked improvement in recent years, which indicates that the authorities' efforts are effective. The usage rate of the 'HoHoSkips' scheme increased to 76 per cent last year, meaning more people have used the service to dispose of construction waste.""

The Office's direct investigation operation revealed that public complaints about illegal disposal of construction waste stand at over 1 000 cases annually. Among the complaints, the number of illegal disposal cases confirmed by the EPD increased to nearly 800 in 2024 from the level of 500 to 600 a few years ago. Furthermore, during the Office's site inspections and shadowing of the EPD's operations, it was not uncommon to find construction waste dumped on streets. Statistics also show that between 2019 and 2024, the EPD instigated an average of around 102 prosecution cases annually. Even in 2019, the year with the highest number of prosecution cases, the prosecution rate was only 3.8 per cent, indicating that the EPD's prosecution rate against illegal disposal of construction waste is extremely low. The Office urges the EPD to review how to further strengthen its enforcement and evidence-gathering effectiveness to improve deterrence against illegal disposal of construction waste.

The EPD's data shows that the usage rate of ""HoHoSkips"" service was 62.5 per cent in 2023, but 27.8 per cent of the cancelled bookings in the same year were due to insufficient capacity of the recycler to meet the demand at peak times, reflecting a mismatch between the operational planning and resource allocation under the scheme and the actual needs of users at that time. Following the launch of this investigation, the EPD has improved the booking process by allowing users to view whether a time slot has been fully booked and showing alternative available slots for their consideration.

In 2024, the recycler made 1 062 more collections than in 2023, raising the service usage rate to 76 per cent. The percentage of cancellations due to overbooking also dropped to 12.1 per cent in 2024, indicating a significant improvement in the usage of ""HoHoSkips"" resources recently. The increase in the number of collections and usage rate in 2024 shows that public demand for the ""HoHoSkips"" service remains strong. The Office recommends that the EPD conduct timely review of the usage rate after the takeover of ""HoHoSkips"" service by a new recycler, and explore ways of better resource allocation, including shortening the average handling time per case to increase available service under the scheme. This will ensure better use of public funds for the benefit of more users. The Office also recommends that the EPD closely monitor changes in the demand for the ""HoHoSkips"" service. If demand continues to rise, the EPD should consider increasing the number of collection vehicles and manpower to meet the growing demand.

Mr Chan said, ""Despite the positive results achieved by the authorities against illegal disposal of construction waste, there is still room for improvement in the EPD's enforcement effectiveness and prosecution, as well as the operation and procedures of the 'HoHoSkips' service, in view of the extremely low rate of prosecution, increase rather than decrease in the number of illegal disposal complaints confirmed by the EPD, and the actual statistics of the 'HoHoSkips' service. We urge the EPD to continue stepping up enforcement and enhance the operation of the 'HoHoSkips' scheme and the supply and demand for its service, thereby further combating illegal disposal of construction waste and optimising the use of resources.""

The Office's major recommendations for improvement to the EPD include:


explore how to further strengthen its enforcement and evidence-gathering effectiveness, such as by making greater use of more advanced technologies to assist and optimise evidence collection, and flexibly deploying staff for targeted inspections and blitz operations, so as to improve prosecution rate and deterrence;
consider reinforcing patrols and surveillance in areas where offences are more likely to occur (such as in the vicinity of newly completed housing estates, and buildings and shops with renovation or repair works in progress) to achieve more targeted enforcement;
work with the recycler of the ""HoHoSkips"" scheme to explore feasible ways of shifting service demand from peak to off-peak times;
conduct timely review of the usage rate after the takeover of ""HoHoSkips"" service by a new recycler, and explore ways of better resource allocation to increase available service at peak times and minimise cancellations;
work with the recycler to shorten the average handling time per case (such as shortening the travel time per case by better route planning), so as to optimise the use of resources and accommodate more bookings; analyse the geographic distribution of past bookings, and consider offering collection service at fixed times and locations in districts with high demand;
closely monitor changes in the demand for the ""HoHoSkips"" service; if demand continues to rise, consider increasing the number of collection vehicles and manpower to meet the growing demand, particularly the number of light goods vehicles that are easier to park by the roadside;
consider engaging with ""HoHoSkips"" users and the trade, or incorporate a feedback feature into the ""HoHoSkips"" mobile app to gather useful input for service improvement;
review and improve the content of both the user guidelines on the ""HoHoSkips"" mobile app and its website, adding important information for the attention of users (including the consequences of cancelling a booking) to minimise cancellations, as well as to ensure correct and smooth use of the recycling service; and
remind and supervise the recycler to promptly announce any service-related changes via both website and mobile app to minimise disruption to users.


The Office is pleased to note that the EPD has accepted all of the improvement recommendations.

Very Hot Weather Warning issued,2025-09-12 06:45,2025-09-12 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091100939.htm,"Attention TV/radio announcers:

Please broadcast the following as soon as possible:

The Hong Kong Observatory has issued the Very Hot Weather Warning.

To prevent heat stroke, avoid prolonged activities outdoors.

If engaged in outdoor work or activities, wear a wide-brimmed hat and light-coloured, loose-fitting clothes. Stay in shaded areas as much as possible.

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-12 06:45,2025-09-12 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091100943.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 12) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."
