InvestHK concludes fruitful Canada visit to deepen economic and business ties (with photos),2025-06-14 13:50,2025-06-14 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061300765.htm,"  Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion at Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) Mr Charles Ng today (June 14) concluded his visit to Canada, deepening economic and business ties with Canadian investors and enterprises.

  During his visit June 8 to 14 to Waterloo, Toronto, and Montreal, Mr Ng met with investors, family offices, start-ups, academia, and business leaders, emphasising Hong Kong's role as a global financial hub and gateway to Mainland China and international markets. He hosted roundtables highlighting Hong Kong's strengths in wealth management and cross-border investments and discussed how Canadian enterprises can leverage Hong Kong for global expansion. He toured innovation labs and facilities at universities and discussed Asian expansion plans with Canadian founders. The meetings connected researchers and ecosystem builders across life sciences, medtech, cleantech, AI, and more.

  Mr Ng also highlighted the upcoming Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025, inviting Canadian investors and entrepreneurs to visit Hong Kong from November 3 to 7 and explore Asia's dynamic markets. The event offers unparalleled access to industry leaders, cutting-edge fintech trends, and high-growth opportunities for positioning companies at the forefront of innovation.

  Mr Ng said, ""The visit was highly fruitful, underscoring the strong economic relationship and vibrant investment exchanges between Hong Kong and Canada. It highlighted Hong Kong's distinctive role as a 'super connector' linking global markets, offering Canadian businesses valuable pathways for expansion into Asia. This engagement not only reinforced ties between the two markets but also unlocked exciting collaborative opportunities.""

  Participants at the events expressed keen interest in Hong Kong's business environment and connectivity. Investor Relations Officer, Velocity Incubator, University of Waterloo, Mr Andrew Martinko, said, ""We learned from Invest Hong Kong about their strong commitment to driving tech innovation through action. They presented a dynamic and expanding start-up ecosystem, clearly focused on welcoming talented Canadian founders and connecting them with high-potential Asian markets and diverse funding opportunities, all within close geographic reach.""

  Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of XSIM AI Canada Inc, Ms Shan Tao, said ""Participating in the StartmeUpHK Festival was a pivotal moment for XSIM AI Canada Inc. The support and insights from InvestHK and the Hong Kong-Canada Business Association helped us uncover the unique opportunities within Hong Kong's ecosystem. It ultimately led to a conditional offer from the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation's Soft Landing Programme, and the establishment of our business there. Hong Kong is where our vision for practical, scalable, purpose-driven industrial AI found both strategic alignment and real momentum - advancing economic value and environmental impact.""

  Partner at DS Avocats and Honorary Secretary of the Federation of Hong Kong Business Associations Worldwide, Ms Cindy Ho, facilitated high-level connections during the trip and shared her insights. She said, ""Canada and Hong Kong share a robust and time-tested business relationship, driving trade, investment, and innovation. With Hong Kong serving as a vital hub for Canadian businesses expanding into Asia, and Canadian expertise fuelling innovation in Hong Kong, this dynamic exchange is unlocking new opportunities and reinforcing bilateral trade and investment in the global economy. As a legal professional working closely with international businesses, I have seen firsthand how Canada and Hong Kong businesses can benefit namely through the Hong Kong-Canada Income Tax Agreement. Together, we are building a future of shared prosperity and ambition, backed by strong trade and investment agreements and a long-term commitment to sustainable growth."""
投資推廣署圓滿結束加拿大訪問　加強經貿商業合作（附圖）,2025-06-14 13:50,2025-06-14 14:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061300768.htm,"投資推廣署助理署長吳國才今日（六月十四日）結束加拿大的訪問行程，進一步加強與加拿大投資者及企業的經貿聯繫。

吳國才於六月八日至十四日到訪滑鐵盧、多倫多及蒙特利爾，其間與投資者、家族辦公室、初創企業、學術界及商界領袖會面，強調香港作為全球金融中心及通往中國內地和國際市場的門戶角色。他主持多場圓桌會議，介紹香港在財富管理及跨境投資方面的優勢，並探討加拿大企業如何利用香港作為拓展全球業務的平台。他亦參觀多所大學的創新實驗室及設施，與加拿大創業家討論拓展亞洲市場的計劃。該些會面連結了生命科學、醫療科技、潔淨科技與人工智能等領域的研究人員及生態系統建設者。

吳國才亦介紹即將舉行的香港金融科技周 x StartmeupHK創業節2025，邀請加拿大投資者及企業家於十一月三日至七日到訪香港，探索亞洲充滿活力的市場。該活動將提供與業界領袖接觸的寶貴機會，展示尖端金融科技趨勢及高增長潛力，協助企業站在創新前沿。

吳國才表示：「是次訪問成效顯著，反映香港與加拿大經貿關係密切，投資交流頻繁。訪問突顯香港作為連接環球市場的『超級聯繫人』優勢，為加國企業開拓亞洲市場提供有利平台。此行不但加強兩地聯繫，更開拓多個合作機遇。」

與會者對香港的營商環境及聯繫網絡反應熱烈。滑鐵盧大學Velocity Incubator投資者關係主任Andrew Martinko表示：「投資推廣署展示了他們透過實際行動推動科技創新的決心。署方介紹了香港蓬勃發展的初創生態圈，並強調歡迎加國創業者來港發展，協助他們聯繫具潛力的亞洲市場及各類融資機遇，發揮香港地理優勢。」

XSIM AI Canada Inc聯合創辦人兼行政總裁Shan Tao表示：「參與StartmeUpHK創業節是XSIM AI Canada Inc的重要里程碑。透過投資推廣署和港加商會的支援，我們發現香港生態圈的獨特機遇。我們更獲得香港科技園公司Soft Landing Programme的有條件取錄，並在香港開設業務。香港是我們實踐實用、可擴展和目標導向的工業人工智能願景的戰略夥伴與驅動力，更同步創造經濟價值及環境效益。」

法國德尚律師事務所合夥人及環球香港商業協會聯盟榮譽秘書長何敏儀在行程中促成多個會議，並分享見解。她表示：「加拿大與香港擁有穩固且歷久不衰的商業關係，推動兩地貿易、投資及創新發展。香港作為加拿大企業拓展亞洲市場的重要樞紐，加拿大的專業知識亦為香港創新注入動力，這種互動正開啓新機遇，並加強雙邊在全球經濟中的貿易與投資。作為與國際企業緊密合作的法律專業人士，我見證兩地企業受惠於香港與加拿大的收入稅務協定。我們正共同構建一個以貿易與投資協議為基礎、可持續增長的繁榮未來。」"

僱主僱員應預先訂立熱帶氣旋及暴雨下的工作安排,2025-06-14 12:20,2025-06-14 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061400346.htm,"由於三號熱帶氣旋警告信號現已生效，勞工處今日（六月十四日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告及極端情況下及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以確保僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主在擬訂及執行在熱帶氣旋及暴雨警告下及其後的工作安排和應變措施時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮他們的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。

當天文台在工作時間內、預計八號熱帶氣旋警告信號生效前的兩小時內發出預警，僱主應按協定的工作安排讓僱員分批離開工作地點、下班或遙距工作。為確保僱員安全和趕及在公共交通服務停止前回家，一些行動不便的僱員（例如懷孕或殘疾僱員）、須依靠容易受惡劣天氣影響的交通服務（例如渡輪服務）返回居所的僱員，以及於偏遠地點工作或居住的僱員（例如離島），應獲准優先離開。僱主亦應安排其他僱員按返家路程的距離或所需時間分批離開工作地點或下班。

如果黃色、紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外及空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣或極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號、黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。

另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"
Employers and employees should make prior work arrangements in times of tropical cyclones and rainstorms,2025-06-14 12:20,2025-06-14 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061400350.htm," As the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 (T3) is now in force, the Labour Department (LD) today (June 14) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of establishments, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

 ""In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements and contingency measures for periods during and after tropical cyclone warnings and rainstorm warnings, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

 To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees, as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or when the extreme conditions come to an end, and when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather and extreme conditions.

 ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when a tropical cyclone warning, rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.

 When a Pre-No. 8 Special Announcement is issued during working hours, within two hours before the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 is expected to take effect, employers should release employees from workplaces or from work in stages or arrange for them to work remotely according to the agreed work arrangements. To ensure the safety of employees and to enable them to arrive home before suspension of public transport services, employees who have mobility problems (for example, pregnant employees or those with a disability), employees who rely on transport services which are prone to being affected by adverse weather conditions (for example, ferry services) to get home, and those who work in or are living in remote areas (for example, outlying islands) should be given priority to leave. Other employees should be released from workplaces or from work in stages according to their travelling distance or the time required for returning home.

If an Amber, Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.

If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance on the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 (T8) or higher, Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.

The spokesman also reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

 ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.

Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when there is a T8 signal or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

Motorists should heed special traffic arrangements during smart motorway operational test at Ting Kau Bridge southbound at noon on June 21 (with photos/video),2025-06-14 10:00,2025-06-14 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061301147.htm,"The Transport Department (TD) today (June 14) announced that a smart motorway operational test will be conducted at the road section of Ting Kau Bridge southbound (Tsing Yi bound) at noon on June 21 (Saturday) for about 15 minutes.

During the test, the fast lane of Ting Kau Bridge southbound will be temporarily closed while the hard shoulder will be open for traffic for the first time. The speed limit will also be reduced to 50 km/h accordingly at the above road section. The TD reminds motorists to pay heed to the lane control signals and speed limits on site when passing through the road section at the above time, and follow the instructions for safe driving.

The trial of the Smart Motorway Pilot Scheme at Ting Kau Bridge southbound launched from December 29, 2024 has been operating smoothly to date. With the application of artificial intelligence technologies, the newly installed Automatic Incident Detection System effectively assists operation staff of the Tsing Ma Control Area in detecting and handling traffic incidents more expeditiously, allowing traffic to resume normal as soon as possible.

As of end-May 2025, the System has effectively detected a total of 16 traffic incidents occurred at the road section within a short time, most of which were minor traffic accidents. Among them, 11 incidents were detected within 10 seconds and immediate alerts were issued to operation staff for follow-up. Compared to the past where operation staff mainly relied on regular CCTV checks to identify traffic incidents, the detection time has now been significantly reduced by nearly 90 per cent, raising the efficiency and capability to respond to incidents.

A spokesman for the TD said, ""To further evaluate the effectiveness of the Pilot Scheme, we will conduct the operational test at noon on June 21, 2025 to assess motorists' compliance with the control signals and their proper use of the hard shoulder, and collect relevant operational data as reference for optimising the Pilot Scheme and formulating the implementation strategy of smart motorways in future.""

The TD will continue to monitor the Pilot Scheme in collaboration with relevant departments, and make suitable refinements to the System and operational arrangements with regard to actual circumstances to ensure road safety and safe motoring."
汀九橋南行六月二十一日中午進行智慧公路操作測試　駕駛人士需注意特別交通安排（附圖／短片）,2025-06-14 10:00,2025-06-14 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061301143.htm,"運輸署今日（六月十四日）公布，汀九橋南行（往青衣方向）路段將於六月二十一日（星期六）中午十二時進行約15分鐘的智慧公路操作測試。

測試期間，汀九橋南行將會短暫封閉快線，同時首次開放路肩行車，而該路段的車速限制亦會相應降至時速50公里。署方提醒駕駛人士於上述時間行經該路段時，留意現場的行車線管制燈號和車速限制，按指示小心駕駛。

汀九橋南行線自去年十二月二十九日起試行智慧公路先導計劃，至今運作暢順。新增的交通事故自動偵察系統利用人工智能技術，有效協助青馬管制區的管控人員更快速偵察和處理交通事故，讓交通盡快恢復正常。

截至今年五月底，系統於短時間內有效偵察到該路段共16宗交通事故，大部分為輕微交通意外。當中11宗於10秒內偵察到，並即時發出警示予管控人員跟進，較以往主要由管控人員透過閉路電視定時排查以識別交通事故，大幅縮短偵察時間近九成，提升了效率和應對能力。

運輸署發言人表示：「為進一步檢視先導計劃的成效，我們將於今年六月二十一日中午時段進行操作測試，評估駕駛人士是否遵從管制燈號正確使用路肩，並收集相關操作的數據，作為優化先導計劃及制定未來推展智慧公路策略的參考。」

運輸署會聯同相關部門持續監察先導計劃，按實際情況適當調整系統及運作安排，確保道路和行車安全。"

孫東教授表示，香港特區政府一直推行靈活的政策，推動世界級基礎建設，並促進環球創科合作。他指出旗艦研發項目──InnoHK創新香港研發平台促進環球研發合作，香港亦正就建設人工智能生態進行了周密部署，包括去年啓用的人工智能超算中心和即將成立的香港人工智能研發院，以及設立100億元的創科產業引導基金，引導更多市場資金投資以人工智能為核心的策略性產業。  

孫東教授強調香港是全球企業進入內地市場的理想門戶。香港特區政府一直積極吸引海內外創科企業在香港落戶或擴展業務。企業選擇香港作為國際總部，充分體現香港作為內地與國際間「超級聯繫人」及「超級增值人」，發揮着把海外企業「引進來」、助力內地企業「走出去」雙向跳板的作用。

在研討會及交流酒會期間，孫東教授亦與一眾當地的創科界人士、投資者和初創企業創始人就創科發展和合作交換意見。

孫東教授亦到香港科技館參觀。今年共有20間分別來自香港科技園公司及數碼港的初創企業參展，展示人工智能、機械人、生命健康科技、可持續發展與氣候科技及金融科技等範疇的最新解決方案及創新產品。孫東教授同時參觀包括VivaTech 2025「年度國家」加拿大所設置的加拿大館、中國館、以及其他領軍及初創企業設立的展館，並與當中參展機構代表作簡短交流，了解其創新方案。

孫東教授傍晚會見La French Tech Hong Kong-Shenzhen 主席Emmanuel Carcassonne ，該社群致力於推動法國初創生態系統在國內外的發展。孫東教授表示，香港是可靠的合作夥伴，支持法國初創企業在香港落戶和擴展業務。

中午，孫東教授禮節性拜會中華人民共和國駐法蘭西共和國大使館公使陳力，向他介紹香港建設國際創科中心，完善創科生態圈，促進上中下游協同發展的工作，以及一直在融入國家創科發展大局方面所作出的努力。

今日（巴黎時間六月十四日）孫東教授將繼續巴黎訪問行程，阿姆斯特丹時間六月十五日轉往荷蘭訪問。"

In his keynote speech at a seminar and networking reception themed ""From Hong Kong to the World: Embarking on the New Journey of Innovation"" organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), Professor Sun said Hong Kong is forging ahead with a clear vision to develop as an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre, and is committed to pushing boundaries, embracing change, and seizing global opportunities.

Professor Sun said the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been introducing agile policies, building world-class infrastructure and facilitating global I&T collaboration. He noted the flagship research and development (R&D) initiative, InnoHK, fosters global R&D collaboration. Hong Kong is also carrying out meticulous planning for building artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, including AI Supercomputing Centre opened last year and the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute to be established, together with $10 billion dollars-worth Innovation and Technology Industry-Oriented Fund channeling more market capital to turbocharge strategic industries, with AI at the core.

Highlighting that Hong Kong being an ideal gateway for global enterprises to enter the Mainland market, Professor Sun said the HKSAR Government has been actively attracting overseas and the Mainland I&T enterprises to set up or expand their businesses in Hong Kong. Companies choosing HK for the international headquarters exemplify Hong Kong’s important role as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"" between Mainland China and the rest of the world, serving as a two-way springboard for attracting overseas enterprises and helping Mainland enterprises to ""go global"".

During the seminar and networking reception, Professor Sun also exchanged views with members of the local I&T sector, investors and start-ups' founders on I&T development and collaboration.

Professor Sun also visited the Hong Kong Tech Pavilion. Twenty start-ups from the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation and Cyberport participated this year, showcasing cutting-edge solutions and innovations in areas of AI, robotics, HealthTech, sustainable and ClimateTech, and Fintech. At the same time, Professor Sun toured the Canada Pavilion set up by Canada which was selected as country of the year for VivaTech 2025, the China Pavilion and pavilions set up by other leading enterprises and start-ups where he had a brief exchange with representatives of the participating organisations to learn more on their innovative solutions.

In the evening, Professor Sun met with Mr Emmanuel Carcassonne, the Chairman of La French Tech Hong Kong-Shenzhen, a community dedicated to supporting the development of the French startup ecosystem both in France and internationally. Professor Sun said that Hong Kong is a reliable partner for French startups to settle and expand businesses in Hong Kong.

In the afternoon, Professor Sun paid a courtesy call on Minister Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in France Mr Chen Li, to brief him on the work of developing Hong Kong into an international I&T centre, enhancing the I&T ecosystem, fostering co-ordinated development among upstream, midstream and downstream, as well as the city's continuous efforts in integrating into national I&T development.

Professor Sun will continue his visit to Paris today (June 14, Paris time) and depart for the Netherlands on June 15 (Amsterdam time)."

Shirley (Special Representative for Hong Kong Economic and Trade Affairs to the European Union, Ms Shirley Yung), Christopher (Director of France, Spain and Portugal of the HKTDC, Mr Christopher Lai), distinguished speakers, guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon! Bonjour! What an honour to stand before you at VivaTech 2025, where the future unfolds in the heart of Paris, a city that has long been a powerhouse of creativity and innovation.

Walking through the exhibition earlier, I could sense the electric energy of young entrepreneurs, the boldness of the start-ups, and the sheer drive for innovation in every corner. It is a spirit Hong Kong knows well. Today, I am here to share how Hong Kong is not only keeping pace with this tech revolution, but also helping to lead it.

Driving innovation: Hong Kong's grand vision

Hong Kong is forging ahead with a clear vision – to become a leading international innovation and technology (I&T) centre. Guided by our I&T development blueprint (Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint) promulgated in December 2022, we have introduced a series of targeted measures to consolidate our research and development (R&D) strengths, accelerate transformation of R&D outcomes and promote the development of tech industries of strategically importance to us including life and health sciences, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, as well as advanced manufacturing and new energy. These efforts have significantly strengthened the I&T ecosystem in Hong Kong, putting us firmly on the right track to unlocking new possibilities.

But vision alone is not enough, we believe in action. Just as VivaTech embodies a spirit of exploration, Hong Kong is committed to pushing boundaries, embracing change, and seizing global opportunities. That's why we are introducing agile polices, developing world-class infrastructure, and forging partnerships that span the globe.

Global Collaboration: InnoHK's expanding reach

You may have heard of InnoHK, our flagship R&D initiative that fosters global R&D collaboration. Currently, we host 30 labs in partnership with 30 top-notch universities and research institutes from 12 economies under two research clusters focusing on AI and robotics, and health technologies. And today, I am thrilled to share that we are launching a third cluster focusing on sustainable development, energy, advanced manufacturing, and materials. France, with your leadership in green energy, is the natural partner. I am confident that, together, we can turn research into real-world impact.

AI: Powering the next frontier and the future

AI is spearheading a new wave of technological revolution and industrial transformation. It is not just the future, it is happening right now. Hong Kong is all in. The solid R&D capabilities and world class talent we have are the best asset supporting our city's AI aspiration. Five of our universities rank among the world's top 50 for data science and AI, positioning Hong Kong as a leading AI hub in Asia.

Our robust AI infrastructure, including the AI Supercomputing Centre which opened last year and the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute to be established, provides solid support to the industry on AI-related research and application. Furthermore, a $10 billion Hong Kong dollars-worth Innovation and Technology Industry-Oriented Fund, equivalent to around 1.1 billion euros, will be there to channel more market capital to turbocharge strategic industries, with AI at the core. We are not just adopting AI, but we are investing in shaping the future.

Hong Kong: A gateway for global enterprises

To bolster downstream industry development, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has been actively attracting I&T enterprises to set up or expand their businesses in Hong Kong. For example, companies like BeyonCa, a premium electric vehicle start-up backed by the Renault Group and Dongfeng Motor Group, has chosen Hong Kong for its international headquarters and final assembly plant. This decision is a testament to Hong Kong's strategic location, favourable business environment, and growing potential in advanced manufacturing. It also exemplifies Hong Kong's important role as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"" between Mainland China and the rest of the world, serving as a two-way springboard for attracting overseas enterprises and helping Mainland enterprises to ""go global"".

Hong Kong's next chapter: shaping the future together

Ladies and gentlemen, innovation is not about incremental steps - it is about leaps. At the Hong Kong Tech Pavilion in Hall 1, you will see 20 pioneering start-ups from our two I&T flagships - Hong Kong Science Park and Hong Kong Cyberport proving just that. From AI to life and health tech, they are redefining what is possible.

Before I close, let me leave you with words from Lei Jun (é·è»), who transformed Xiaomi into a global tech leader: ""Dream big, start small, and act fast. The speed of execution is everything in innovation."" To every innovators and entrepreneurs here: whether you are from France or beyond, your next big idea deserves a launchpad that moves as fast as you do. Let's make it happen in Hong Kong!

Thank you. Merci."
禁毒綜藝電視節目　回顧60年禁毒歷史　展望無毒香港（附圖／短片）,2025-06-13 23:04,2025-06-13 23:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300353.htm,"禁毒常務委員會（禁常會）呈獻的大型禁毒綜藝電視節目《一齊企硬．唔Take嘢》今日（六月十三日）晚上在將軍澳電視廣播城舉行。政務司司長陳國基在節目上致辭，並聯同保安局局長鄧炳強、禁常會主席李國棟醫生、保安局副局長卓孝業等為節目主禮，為一連串精彩禁毒表演揭開序幕。

陳國基致辭時表示，在上世紀六十年代，香港深受毒品問題困擾。自禁常會成立以來，一直匯聚政府和社會各界力量同心抗毒。從一九七七年有記錄以來至二○二四年，被呈報吸毒者總人數跌幅高達七成。而去年涉及嚴重毒品案而被捕的21歲以下青少年人數，創下有記錄以來的新低。香港的禁毒工作取得驕人成就，禁常會功不可沒。

他說：「今年是禁毒常務委員會成立60周年，我很高興能夠在這個重要時刻，參與今日的節目，和大家一起回顧本港禁毒工作的發展……我代表特區政府向所有曾參與禁毒工作的人士，致以衷心的謝意……我呼籲各位市民幫忙宣揚『一齊企硬 唔Take嘢！』的決心，一同攜手邁向無毒未來，守護好每一位市民的健康。」

在開幕禮上，陳國基帶領一眾主禮嘉賓啓動裝置，七款象徵不同毒品的道具隨即掉進一象徵銷毀裝置的機關，代表害人不淺的毒品皆被銷毀。陳國基帶領一眾主禮嘉賓宣讀禁毒口號「一齊企硬 唔Take嘢！」，起動一連串的精彩禁毒表演。

李國棟醫生通過錄影短片為節目致辭時表示，香港的禁毒工作取得進展，實在有賴全港市民積極參與，60年來幾代人齊心嚴厲打擊毒品。他感謝各位前人對禁毒工作作出的貢獻。他又說：「我邀請電視機前的你，繼續踴躍參與禁毒工作。我相信有你們的參與，無毒香港，指日可待。」

於節目上，一眾青春偶像及歌手獻唱正向歌曲，包括禁毒主題曲《青春作風》，以輕快的節奏帶出正能量，鼓勵年輕人堅守正向人生觀。

香港海關的「香港海關青年發展計劃」成員於一歌唱環節中，演奏豎琴及表演舞蹈，透過古典音樂及現代舞的衝擊，帶出正向興趣不但能擴闊視野、展現才能，更能鞏固禁毒決心。

香港警務處的「禁毒領袖學院」成員表演花式跳繩和富活力的嘻哈舞蹈，告訴觀眾透過運動鍛煉出強健體魄和堅毅意志，是抵抗毒品誘惑的其中一個最佳途徑。武術運動員莫宛螢及乒乓球運動員黃鎮廷亦分別於此環節中，以他們的拿手好戲——剛柔並濟的武術（套路）和以速度見稱的乒乓球球藝，為年輕人打氣。

懲教署的「更生先鋒領袖」成員，以街頭音樂表演模式，彈奏夏威夷小吉他、電子琴及吉他，希望藉此引起年輕人共鳴，並希望透過演奏的歌曲表達，健康的精神狀態是遠離毒品的必要元素。

另外，節目亦安排藝人演出以成功戒毒人士經歷改編而成的短劇，並由該戒毒人士參與演出。

節目由禁常會及保安局禁毒處合辦、電視廣播有限公司製作，以回顧香港60年來的禁毒歷史，並凝聚社會力量，共同打擊毒禍，展望無毒香港。節目有來自不同界別，包括學生、青少年團體、教育及社福等代表參與。此節目為禁常會成立60周年紀念活動之一。

節目將於六月二十一日晚上九時在無綫電視翡翠台播出，歡迎市民收看，一起傳遞禁毒信息，共同建設無毒香港。"
Anti-drug variety TV programme reviews 60 years of anti-drug history envisioning drug-free Hong Kong (with photos/video),2025-06-13 23:04,2025-06-13 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300474.htm,"  The large-scale anti-drug variety TV programme ""Let's Stand Firm. Knock Drugs Out!"" presented by the Action Committee Against Narcotics (ACAN) was held at TVB City in Tseung Kwan O this evening (June 13). The Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, delivered a speech at the programme and officiated at the kick-off ceremony of a series of spectacular anti-drug performances along with the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung; the Chairman of ACAN, Dr Donald Li; the Under Secretary for Security, Mr Michael Cheuk, and other guests.

  Mr Chan said in his speech that Hong Kong was previously plagued by drug problems in the 1960s. Since the establishment of ACAN, the Government and various sectors of the community have been working together to combat drug problems. From 1977, when records started to be kept, to 2024, the total number of reported drug abusers has dropped by as much as 70 per cent. Last year, the number of young people under the age of 21 arrested for serious drug offences was at a record low. ACAN has been instrumental in the success of Hong Kong's anti-drug efforts.

  He said, ""This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Action Committee Against Narcotics. I am glad to be able to take part in the programme today and review with everyone the development of the anti-drug efforts in Hong Kong on this important occasion...On behalf of the HKSAR Government, I would like to express heartfelt gratitude to all those who have participated in the anti-drug cause...I would like to appeal to all members of the public to help spread the steadfast message of 'Let's Stand Firm. Knock Drugs Out!' and work together towards a drug-free future to safeguard the health of every member of the public.""

  At the opening ceremony, Mr Chan led the officiating guests in activating a device, after which seven props symbolising different drugs were dropped into a machine symbolising the destruction of pernicious drugs. Mr Chan led the officiating guests to read out the anti-drug slogan ""Let's Stand Firm. Knock Drugs Out!"" to launch a series of spectacular anti-drug performances.

  Delivering a speech through a recorded short video for the programme, Dr Li said that the progress of Hong Kong's anti-drug efforts owed a lot to the active participation of members of the public in Hong Kong and the concerted efforts of several generations in the fight against drugs over the past 60 years. He thanked everyone who had participated in anti-drug work before for their contributions. ""I invite you, in front of the TV, to continue to participate actively in the anti-drug efforts. I believe that with your participation, a drug-free Hong Kong is just around the corner,"" he added.

  In the programme, various young idols and singers performed songs with positive messages, including an upbeat anti-drug theme song that shares with young people positive energy and encourages them to hold dear to positive values in life.

  Members of Hong Kong Customs' ""Customs YES"" played the harp and danced in a musical segment. Through the impact of classical music and modern dance, a message was conveyed that positive hobbies not only broaden one's horizons and let one's talents shine, but also strengthen one's determination against drugs.

  Members of the Hong Kong Police Force's ""Leadership Institute on Narcotics"" performed rope skipping and hip hop dance with energetic vibes, letting the audience know that one of the best ways to resist the temptation of drugs is to build a strong body and a determined mind through sports. Wushu athlete Juanita Mok and table tennis athlete Wong Chun-ting also cheered for youngsters in this segment with their respective fortes - Wushu (Taolu) that combines strength and flexibility, and table tennis, which is known for its speed.

  Members of the Correctional Services Department's ""Rehabilitation Pioneer Leaders"" performed in the form of busking with ukulele, electric piano and guitars, in the hope of striking a chord with young people and expressing through the songs that a healthy state of mind is essential for staying away from drugs.

  In addition, the programme has arranged for artists to re-enact short plays based on the true stories of rehabilitees who have successfully quit drugs. The rehabilitees have participated in the plays themselves.

  Co-organised by the Narcotics Division of the Security Bureau and ACAN, and produced by Television Broadcasts Limited, the programme aims to review Hong Kong's anti-drug history over the past 60 years and rally community support for combating drug problems. Audience members from different sectors, including students, youth groups and representatives from the education and social welfare sectors, attended the programme. This programme is one of the eventsheld in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of ACAN.

  The programme will be broadcast on TVB Jade at 9pm on June 21. Members of the public are welcome to watch and disseminate anti-drug messages for building a drug-free Hong Kong together."
"Two property owners fined over $110,000 in total for carrying out unauthorised building works",2025-06-13 22:42,2025-06-13 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061301064.htm,"âTwo owners of detached houses on Redhill Peninsula pleaded guilty at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts yesterday (June 12) for carrying out unauthorised building works (UBWs), contravening section 14(1) of the Buildings Ordinance (Cap. 123) (BO), namely, knowingly carrying out building works without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD). They were fined over $110,000 in total by the court.

The BD discovered certain UBWs at the two detached houses during a large-scale operation in September 2023 to inspect houses along the coastal area of Redhill Peninsula. Investigation by the BD found that the owners of the two houses had knowingly carried out the concerned building works without the prior approval and consent from the BD, contravening section 14(1) of the BO. Hence, the BD instigated prosecution action against the two owners under section 40(1AA) of the BO in August last year. The two owners were convicted and fined $30,000 and $82,980 respectively yesterday.

A spokesman for the BD said today (June 13), ""The Redhill Peninsula incident reveals that coastal detached houses with UBWs or illegal occupation of government land can pose safety hazards and risks to nearby slopes. If such contraventions are discovered, the BD will take vigorous enforcement actions and instigate prosecution actions. Property owners should consult building professionals before carrying out building works to ensure compliance with the BO.""

The spokesperson said that these are the first two convictions for contravening section 14(1) of the BO in relation to the Redhill Peninsula incident. The BD has already instigated prosecutions against 30 detached houses on Redhill Peninsula, including the above two houses. Court hearings for these cases are being rolled out.

Pursuant to section 40(1AA) of the BO, any person who knowingly contravenes section 14(1) (i.e. commencement or carrying out any building works without having first obtained approval and consent from the BD), commits an offence and is liable upon conviction to a fine of $400,000 and to imprisonment for two years, and a further fine of $20,000 for each day that the offence continues.

The Government has earlier on put forward proposals to amend the BO, including increasing the penalties to enhance deterrence against failure to comply with statutory notices or orders by the specified time and offences against serious UBWs. The Government is drafting the legislative amendments, with a view to submitting the amendment bill to the Legislative Council in the first half of 2026."

The CFS is following up on the incident.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned sample from a licensed frozen confection factory in Sha Tin for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that the sample contained 260 coliform bacteria per gram, exceeding the legal limit.""

""The CFS has informed the frozen confection factory concerned of the irregularity and instructed it to stop selling and to dispose all the affected ice-cream immediately. The CFS has also provided health education on food safety and hygiene to the staff of the frozen confection factory, who have also been requested to carry out thorough cleaning and disinfection of the premises,"" the spokesman said.

Under the Frozen Confections Regulation (Cap. 132AC), frozen confection for sale should not contain more than 100 coliform bacteria per gram. The maximum penalty for offenders is a fine of $10,000 and three months' imprisonment upon conviction. The fact that the coliform count exceeded the legal limit indicated that the hygienic conditions were unsatisfactory, but did not mean that consumption would lead to food poisoning.

The CFS will continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action to safeguard food safety and public health. An investigation is ongoing."

各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

歡迎大家出席由香港特區政府舉辦的「中華文化節2025」開幕酒會。

香港是國際城市，薈萃中西，具備深厚中華文化底蘊。特區政府去年成立弘揚中華文化辦公室，通過多元化的展覽、交流、合作、推廣活動等，讓市民體會中華文化的精髓，加強國家認同，傳承和宣揚家國精神。

弘揚中華文化辦公室去年舉辦首屆「中華文化節」，成功舉辦超過250場演出和活動，吸引高達90萬的參與人次。多項節目大獲好評，有效提升民族和文化自信，而為培育年輕一代而設的「普及中華文化藝術專場」，更惠及超過7 000名師生及社區人士，成績令人鼓舞。

今年的「中華文化節」將呈獻超過280場節目及活動，為廣大市民和旅客帶來豐富精彩的中華文化藝術演出。文化節的開幕節目是由中國東方演藝集團演出的現代舞詩劇《詩憶東坡》，以充滿創意的現代舞蹈，展現蘇軾這位著名文學家的詩詞與人生。表演融會詩詞、國畫、書法、古琴等中華傳統文化元素，通過嶄新手法演繹蘇東坡廣為傳誦的詩篇，為觀眾帶來耳目一新的體驗。

今年的「中華文化節」亦會呈獻精選中國戲曲、獲國家藝術基金肯定的本地優秀作品、與香港文聯（中國文學藝術界聯合會香港會員總會）和多個文藝組織合辦的精彩項目。今年亦配合香港歷史博物館的秦漢文明展覽，以西安作為焦點城市呈獻不同的表演和活動，亦將有以茶文化作主題的一系列節目，令人期待。

政府會充分發揮香港在「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，向世界弘揚優秀的中華傳統文化，透過香港的國際網絡向世界說好中國故事。

政府去年公布的《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，以弘揚中華傳統優秀文化為重要的工作方向。我有信心「中華文化節」會成為香港的年度文化品牌活動，將博大精深、絢爛多彩的中華文化，以創新手法呈現觀眾眼前。我們會繼續向香港市民和來自海外及內地的旅客傳揚中華文化的精粹，實現「以文塑旅、以旅彰文」，達致文旅共融、相互帶動的作用。

但願人長久，千里共嬋娟。蘇東坡精練的詩句，寫出了千百年來世人的美好願望。就讓我們藉「中華文化節」繼續傳承及發揚中華文化！多謝大家。"

I would now like to turn to our English-speaking friends.

Welcome to the opening reception of the Chinese Culture Festival 2025.

Launched last year by the Government, the Chinese Culture Festival aims to showcase the remarkable virtues of traditional Chinese culture to the world. In 2024, we successfully presented over 250 performances and activities, attracting a substantial attendance of 900 000.

This year, the second edition of the Chinese Culture Festival will present more than 280 programmes and activities. To kick-start the Festival, this evening we are presenting a contemporary dance drama to you. Titled ""Dongpo: Life in Poems"", this performance is brought to you by the China Oriental Performing Arts Group, and uses a variety of innovative means to present Chinese poetry, calligraphy, painting and music.

Other Festival programmes include Chinese operas, local performances as recognised by the China National Arts Fund, as well as specially curated programmes co-organised with the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Hong Kong Member Association and arts and cultural organisations.

Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is the only world city that enjoys both the China advantage and the global advantage. We will make full use of Hong Kong's position as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange to promote the beauty of Chinese culture.

An important strategic direction featured in the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development, published by the Government last year, is on the promotion of the profound traditional Chinese culture. I am confident that the Chinese Culture Festival will become a new major annual cultural event in Hong Kong, attracting not only local residents but also Mainland and overseas tourists with its vibrant programme.

屋宇署於二○二三年九月開展大規模行動，巡查紅山半島臨海一帶獨立屋，在涉事兩幢獨立屋發現僭建物。屋宇署調查發現，兩幢獨立屋的業主明知未事先獲得屋宇署批准及同意便進行有關建築工程，違反《建築物條例》第14（1）條。屋宇署遂於去年八月根據《建築物條例》第40（1AA）條對業主提出檢控。兩名業主昨日分別被定罪及判處罰款三萬元及八萬二千九百八十元。

屋宇署發言人今日（六月十三日）說:「紅山半島事件揭示沿海獨立屋如有僭建或非法佔用政府土地情況，會對周遭斜坡構成安全隱患和風險。如發現違規情況，屋宇署會嚴正執法並提出檢控。業主在物業進行建築工程之前，應先諮詢建築專業人士的意見，確保建築工程符合《建築物條例》的規定。」

發言人表示，這是紅山半島獨立屋僭建事件首兩宗違反《建築物條例》第14（1）條被定罪個案。計及涉事兩幢獨立屋，屋宇署已先後向紅山半島30幢獨立屋提出檢控，法院正陸續展開聆訊。

根據《建築物條例》第40（1AA）條的規定，任何人明知而違反《建築物條例》第14（1）條（即在未事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，展開或進行任何建築工程），即屬犯罪，一經定罪，可處罰款四十萬元及監禁兩年；及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款二萬元。

政府早前提出修訂《建築物條例》的建議，當中包括針對未依時遵辦法定通知或命令和嚴重僭建物的罪行增加罰則以加強阻嚇力。政府正草擬修訂法例，目標是在二○二六年上半年向立法會提交草案。"

李國棟主席（禁毒常務委員會主席）、各位禁毒常務委員會委員、各位嘉賓、各位觀眾：

大家好！禁毒常務委員會在一九六五年成立，一直為政府就禁毒策略方面出謀獻策。今年是禁毒常務委員會（禁常會）成立60周年，我很高興能夠在這個重要時刻，參與今日的節目，和大家一起回顧本港禁毒工作的發展，並且宣傳禁毒的信息。

在上世紀六十年代，香港深受毒品困擾。自從禁常會成立以來，一直匯聚政府和社會各界力量同心抗毒。經過大家多年的努力，以及透過宣傳教育、治療及康復服務、立法和執法等多管齊下的策略，香港的毒品問題大幅改善。

從一九七七年有紀錄以來至二○二四年，被呈報吸毒者總人數跌幅高達七成。而去年涉及嚴重毒品案而被捕的21歲以下青少年人數亦創下有紀錄以來的新低。香港的禁毒工作取得驕人成就，禁常會實在是功不可沒。在這裏，我代表特區政府向所有曾參與禁毒工作的人士，致以衷心的謝意！

毒品形勢日新月異，政府抗毒的工作當然要與時並進。近來大家最關注的毒品問題，相信一定是「太空油毒品」。政府已經在今年二月修例，將「太空油毒品」的主要成分列為毒品，令執法部門可以更有效執法，提升阻嚇力，進一步打擊「太空油毒品」的禍害。

除了立法和執法，我們亦非常重視預防教育和宣傳，提高市民的抗毒意識。今天這個節目，動員了一眾藝人、紀律部隊以及成功戒毒的朋友，透過舞蹈、戲劇等不同元素，將禁毒信息帶入家家戶戶，希望大家觀賞節目後，可以學到實用的禁毒知識，一起「向毒品說不」！

最後，我呼籲各位市民幫忙宣揚「一齊企硬唔Take嘢！」的決心，一同攜手邁向無毒未來，守護好每一位市民的健康。多謝各位！"

各位嘉賓、各位朋友︰

大家好！很榮幸能夠參加2025財新夏季峰會，與各位共同探討內地與香港金融合作的新聯通、新動能。

香港在「一國兩制」的制度下，憑藉資金自由進出、穩健的法治基礎、完善的金融基建以及與國際接軌的監管制度，已發展成為亞洲領先的國際金融中心。在最新一期《全球金融中心指數》中，香港繼續排名全球第三，亞洲第一；香港並在投資管理、保險業與融資等多個領域名列全球第一，充分反映香港的綜合實力與國際信心。

我們一直致力於深化內地與香港金融市場的聯通，促進資金、產品、機構和人才的雙向流動，讓香港更好地發揮「引進來、走出去」的雙重平台角色。

在資本市場方面，我們見證着令人鼓舞的增長。今年五月底，香港股票市場總市值達到40.9萬億港元，較去年同期上升百分之二十四；今年首五個月平均每日平均成交額超過2,400億港元，較去年同期上升超過一倍。今年首五個月的首次公開招股集資金額達到777億港元，較去年同期上升超過七倍。當中有26家來自內地的新上市公司，凸顯香港把國際資金「引進來」投資內地企業的重要功能。

今年截至五月，「滬港通」和「深港通」的北向交易平均每日交易額為1,760.8億人民幣，較去年同期上升百分之三十三；而南向交易平均每日交易額則達1,088.8億港元，較去年同期上升百分之一百九十一。這不僅體現出國際投資者對利用「互聯互通」透過香港投資內地市埸的高度信任，也反映香港為內地投資者多元化配置資產中的獨特作用，進一步發揮香港重要的橋樑功能。

在債券市場方面，二○二四年香港是亞洲區最大的亞洲國際債券發行中心，連續17年排名區內第一。二○二四年相關發行總額超過1,300億美元，按年增長百分之五十。同時，香港已成為離岸人民幣債券發行的首選平台。二○二四年，在港發行的離岸人民幣債券總額達10,716億人民幣，按年增長超過百分之三十六。事實上，自二○○九年起，財政部已連續17年在港發行人民幣主權債券，而多個內地省市政府亦選擇在港發債，包括深圳、海南及廣東等地。

為進一步促進發行，我們已將在香港發行的所有內地各級地方人民政府債務票據納入利得稅豁免範圍。這一舉措安排大大提升內地地方政府在港發債的吸引力，進一步鞏固香港在人民幣國際化進程中，作為國家金融開放的「試驗田」角色。

為進一步推動市場開放與互聯互通，我們正在積極與內地監管機構合作，推動一系列措施落地。

例如，我們計劃在香港推出內地政府債券期貨，並研究擴大南向債券通的投資者資格，納入更多非銀行金融機構如證券公司與保險公司。

我們也積極推動「互換通」的深化發展。中國人民銀行、香港證監會（證券及期貨事務監察委員會）與香港金融管理局已於今年五月共同宣布，將延長利率互換合約期限至30年，並推出以貸款市場報價利率（LPR）為基準的新產品，進一步拓展風險管理工具的深度與廣度。

在流動性支持方面，我們亦與人民銀行合作推出人民幣貿易融資流動資金安排，總額度為1,000億人民幣，協助銀行為企業提供跨境人民幣融資服務。此舉將進一步支持實體經濟發展，強化人民幣作為國際貿易與投資貨幣的功能。

各位嘉賓，作為國家的國際金融中心，香港與內地的金融合作正處於加速深化的新階段。我們有信心，透過持續擴大市場聯通、提升人民幣產品流動性、推動資本雙向流動與風險管理工具創新，香港將繼續擔當好「超級聯繫人」與風險緩衝的角色，為國家金融改革開放與高質量發展注入新動能。

我們將繼續以開放、創新、穩健的原則，鞏固香港作為中國與世界之間的資本橋樑，並攜手內地共同推動亞洲以至全球金融市場的可持續發展。謝謝！"

Beware of fraudsters posing as HKMA staff,2025-06-13 18:37,2025-06-13 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300752.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

SFST made positive progress with signing of CDTA with Norway during his visit  (with photos),2025-06-13 18:33,2025-06-13 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061200721.htm,"The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said during his visit to Oslo, Norway, on June 11 and 12 (Oslo time) that Hong Kong and Norway could create a powerful synergy to address global challenges with regards to climate change and digital transformation, leveraging the complementary strengths of the two places. He was also pleased that after his meeting with the Norwegian Ministry of Finance, positive progress was made with the early signing of a comprehensive avoidance of double taxation agreement (CDTA) between Hong Kong and Norway.

Over a meeting with the Norwegian State Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Mr Torgeir Micaelsen, and the Director General of Tax Law Department, Mr Omar G Dajani, on June 12 (Oslo time), Mr Hui urged for an early signing of a CDTA between the two places. Mr Micaelsen responded positively and indicated that they will look into the matter to expedite the process. Mr Hui also told the gathering that Hong Kong had just been confirmed by the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation as being among the initial set of jurisdictions having set a target of fully adopting the ISSB Standards. This affirms Hong Kong's efforts and determination in supporting and promoting a common international language in sustainability disclosures.

 To unlock new opportunities in the area of maritime finance, Mr Hui met with the Chief Customer Officer, Ms Line Dahle, and Vice President and Head of Analytics, Mr Sigvald Fossum, of Norwegian marine and energy insurance provider Gard, which has a strong presence in Hong Kong's marine insurance market and provides services to manage maritime risk for clients. He also met with the Vice-President and Director of Group Government and Public Affairs of DNV, Mr Lars Almklov. The global assurance and risk management company DNV has been recognised by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as an approved external reviewer for the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme.

 Mr Hui told management members of the two companies that Hong Kong and Norway possess complementary strengths that can create a compelling case for financial co-operation. While Norway's maritime industry is the cornerstone of its economy, Hong Kong's maritime services industry is also a valued brand in the international arena. Joint ventures in maritime insurance could combine Norway's expertise in marine risk management with Hong Kong's accessibility, creating comprehensive solutions for the sector and addressing the new demands arising from geopolitical and climatic challenges. He highlighted that Hong Kong has a sophisticated ecosystem for ship financing and leasing, supported by tax incentives and its strategic location along global trade routes.

On June 12 (Oslo time), Mr Hui paid a courtesy call to the Chinese Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Norway, Ms Hou Yue.

He also had a meeting with the Director of Politics and Society of Finance Norway, Mr Jan Erik Fane, and other management staff. Finance Norway is the industry organisation for the financial sector in Norway, representing banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions on regulatory, policy and industry developments.

 Mr Hui noted that the Norwegian sovereign fund is one of the largest funds in the world and is positioned as a pioneer in responsible investing with a strong emphasis on Environmental, Social and Governance principles. He said that the shared focus of Hong Kong and Norway on sustainability creates significant opportunities for collaboration.
 At a dinner reception co-organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, London, and the Norway-Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce on June 11 (Oslo time), Mr Hui said that even though there is a geographical distance of around 8 600 kilometres between Norway and Hong Kong, the two places share more commonalities in the financial market than perceived.

 The first one is the commitment to green and sustainable developments. Hong Kong is striving to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, and the Government launched a roadmap last December to require publicly accountable entities (PAEs) to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure Standards (ISSB Standards) and to provide a well-defined pathway for large PAEs to fully adopt the ISSB Standards no later than 2028.

 Just last week, Hong Kong issued a new round of Government green bonds and infrastructure bonds to channel market capital to support green projects and promote sustainable developments in Hong Kong. This round of bonds amounts to a total of around US$3.5 billion, denominated in Hong Kong dollars, Renminbi, US dollars and euros. The offering attracted participation from a wide spectrum of investors from more than 30 markets across Asia, Europe, Middle East, and the Americas, with total orders amounting to an equivalent of around US$30 billion, representing a subscription ratio of almost nine times.

 The other commonality is expertise in wealth management. Mr Hui noted that Norway's expertise in long-term asset management driven by its sovereign fund aligns seamlessly with Hong Kong's position as Asia's premier wealth management centre. Capitalising on Hong Kong's advantages of having a solid financial infrastructure and an extensive international client base, abundant co-investment opportunities are available for Norwegian capital in the Asian markets, particularly in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).

 More commonalities lie in fintech and digital finance. Norway is a highly digitalised economy that has fostered advancements in mobile payment systems, blockchain technology, and digital asset management. At the same time, Hong Kong is home to around 1 100 fintech companies and start-ups. The Government endeavours to boost fintech developments through measures such as enhancing fintech infrastructures, nurturing talent, establishing regulatory regimes for digital assets such as the stablecoin regulatory regime to be enacted on August 1. The second edition of a policy statement on digital assets will also be promulgated soon.

財庫局局長挪威之行推動簽訂全面性避免雙重課稅協定取得正面進展（附圖）,2025-06-13 18:32,2025-06-13 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061200718.htm,"財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇六月十一及十二日（奧斯陸時間）出訪挪威奧斯陸時表示，香港與挪威透過互補優勢，可形成強大的協同效應，共同應對氣候變遷和數碼轉型等全球挑戰。他也很高興在與挪威財政部會面後，就盡早簽訂香港與挪威的全面性避免雙重課稅協定取得正面進展。

在六月十二日（奧斯陸時間）與挪威財政部國務秘書Torgeir Micaelsen和稅法司秘書長Omar G Dajani會面時，許正宇促請盡早簽訂兩地之間的全面性避免雙重課稅協定。Torgeir Micaelsen反應正面，並表示會研究加快相關程序。許正宇也提到香港剛獲國際財務報告準則基金會確認為首批以全面採用ISSB準則為目標的司法管轄區，印證香港在支持和推動國際共通可持續披露信息的努力和決心獲得認同。

為拓展海事金融領域的新機遇，許正宇與一家挪威海事及能源保險供應商Gard的客戶服務總監Line Dahle 和副總裁兼市場分析部主管Sigvald Fossum會面。該公司為客戶提供海事風險管理服務，佔有香港海事保險市場相當的份額。許正宇也與全球審計及風險管理公司DNV的副總裁兼集團政府及公共事務通訊總監Lars Almklov見面。該公司為香港金融管理局「綠色和可持續金融資助計劃」的認可外部評審機構。

許正宇向兩家公司的管理人員表示，香港和挪威擁有互補優勢，在金融領域的合作空間極具潛力。挪威的航運業是其經濟基石，而香港的航運服務業在國際舞台上亦是「金漆招牌」。合營航運保險可以將挪威在航運風險管理方面的專業知識與香港的通達性相結合，為航運業打造全面的解決方案的同時，也能照顧地緣政治和氣候挑戰帶來的新需求。他特別提到，香港擁有完善的船舶融資和租賃生態圈，還有稅務優惠和位處全球貿易航線戰略要地的優勢。

許正宇於六月十二日（奧斯陸時間）禮節性拜會了中國駐挪威王國特命全權大使侯悅。

他亦與挪威金融協會政治及社會事務總監Jan Erik Fane及該協會管理人員會面。該協會是挪威金融業的業界組織，就監管、政策和產業發展代表銀行、保險公司和其他金融機構發聲。

許正宇提到，挪威主權基金是全球最大的基金之一，是負責任投資的先驅，高度重視環境、社會和管治原則。他表示，香港與挪威同樣關注可持續發展，為兩地合作創造無限機遇。

許正宇六月十一日（奧斯陸時間）在香港駐倫敦經濟貿易辦事處與挪威香港商會聯合舉辦的晚宴上致辭時表示，挪威與香港雖然在地理上相距約八千六百公里，但兩地在金融市場的共同點卻比意想中多。

首先是兩地對綠色和可持續發展的承諾。香港致力在二○五○年前達致碳中和，政府並在去年十二月推出路線圖，要求公眾責任實體採用國際財務報告可持續披露準則（ISSB準則）的方針，並就不遲於二○二八年大型公眾責任實體全面採用ISSB準則提供清晰的路徑。

上週，香港發行新一輪政府綠色債券及基礎建設債券，以引導巿場資金支持綠色項目和推動香港的可持續發展。此輪基金發行總額約35億美元，以港元、人民幣、美元和歐元計價。是次發行吸引了來自亞洲、歐洲、中東和美洲逾30多個市場的環球投資者廣泛參與，錄得總認購金額約300億美元等值，認購額差不多達發行額的九倍。

另一個共同點是財富管理的優勢。許正宇指出，挪威以其主權基金為主導，在長期資產管理方面有深厚經驗，與香港作為亞洲首要財富管理中心的地位完美契合。憑藉香港穩固的金融基礎設施和廣泛的國際客戶群，挪威資本在亞洲市場，尤其是粵港澳大灣區，可享有龐大的共同投資機會。

金融科技和數碼金融領域也是兩地有共同點之處。挪威是一個高度數碼化的經濟體，一直大力推動行動支付系統、區塊鏈技術和數碼資產管理。與此同時，香港擁有約1100家金融科技公司和初創企業。政府致力促進金融科技發展，推出不同措施去強化金融科技基礎設施、培養人才、建立數碼資產監管制度等，其中八月一日便會實施穩定幣監管制度，而第二份數碼資產政策宣言亦發布在即。透過結合挪威的科技創新與經香港進入亞洲市場的便利性，兩地合作可望推動尖端解決方案，為全球重新定義數碼金融。

許正宇六月十三日傍晚已返抵香港。"

2024年涉及長者的騙案達6 345宗，較2023年的4 929宗上升百分之28；今年一至四月相關騙案亦較去年同期上升約兩成至逾1 700宗，當中過半為網上騙案，另外約四成與電話騙案有關。

在今日的周年大會上，44名耆樂警訊會員獲頒發「最佳耆樂隊長」及「最活躍耆樂會員」的獎項，以表揚他們過去一年積極參與活動。

Senior Police Call AGM cum Luncheon held (with photos),2025-06-13 18:11,2025-06-13 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300717.htm," The Annual General Meeting (AGM) 2024 cum Luncheon of the Senior Police Call (SPC) took place today (June 13) at the Police Officers' Club to review the activities held over the past year. Views of the participants were listened at the meeting and a new strategic direction, ""PALS@SPC"", was also introduced.

Speaking at the luncheon, the Commissioner of Police, Mr Chow Yat-ming, said the SPC has been established for over ten years, aiming at promoting safety, health and community participation of the elderly. The Government adopted measures to promote the silver economy last month to enhance the quality of life for the elderly. In line with the policy direction, the SPC has launched a wide range of activities and training programmes to help its members achieve physical, mental and spiritual health.

In order to enhance the anti-deception awareness among senior citizens and to tackle the various and emerging deception tactics, the SPC launched the ""IT Captain"" training programme in May this year. This includes the education on the use of the one-stop scam and pitfall search engine ""Scameter+"". Together with the ""SPC Wealth Management and Anti-Investment Scam Ambassador"" programme, the elderly get familiarised with the latest scam tactics and cyber traps, and are encouraged to spread the message of fraud prevention in the community. Trained ""IT Captains"" will guide elderly and citizens in the community to use the commonly-used mobile apps of the Government, assisting them to integrate into digital life.

An increase of 28 per cent was recorded in the number of deception cases involving elderly victims, reaching 6345 cases in 2024 compared to 4929 cases in 2023. There was also an increase of approximately 20 per cent in related fraud cases from January to April this year compared to the same period last year, to over 1700 cases. Of these, more than half were classified as online frauds, while around 40 per cent were related to telephone scams.

At the AGM today, 44 SPC members were presented with the""Best SPC Captain"" and ""Most Active SPC Member"" awards in recognition of their enthusiastic participation over the past year.

The newly launched ""PALS@SPC"" initiative this year represents four key themes of the SPC’s activities, with ""P"" standing for ""Participate"", ""A"" for ""Alert"", ""L"" for ""Learn"" and ""S"" for ""Safeguard"". The SPC will continue to collaborate with various organisations to roll out a broader range of programmes, encouraging more senior citizens to become SPC members, and to enhance themselves through recreation and sports activities as well as courses and seminars. Being crime-fighting partners of the Police, SPC members join hands to serve the community and achieve the SPC sprit – ""Helping Oneself and Others"".

尊敬的張棟主任（國家文化和旅遊部亞洲旅遊交流中心主任）、李曙光副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室宣傳文體部副部長）、鄒治宇副市長（江西省贛州市人民政府黨組成員、副市長）、麥勁生教授（非物質文化遺產諮詢委員會主席）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家下午好！今日我非常高興出席「根與魂 — 物華天寶 非常客家：江西省非物質文化遺產展演」的開幕典禮。

行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》中提出自今年起每年舉辦「香港非遺月」，透過一系列的多元化活動，推動非物質文化遺產（非遺）保護和傳承工作。今年首屆的「香港非遺月」涵蓋超過100項非遺項目，而今天開幕的展覽正是「香港非遺月」其中一個重點項目，展覽作為香港與江西省非遺交流的橋樑，充分彰顯兩地歷史文化的一脈相承。

習近平總書記在二十大的報告提及加大文物和文化遺產保護力度，推進文化自信自強。江西省積極推動非遺保護工作，至今已有三個非遺項目獲列入聯合國教科文組織《人類非物質文化遺產代表作名錄》，且擁有88項國家級非遺，充分顯示江西省深厚的文化底蘊，致力進行非遺保護跟傳承的豐碩成果，為我們的民族立魂，為我們的生活點睛。

江西省與粵港澳大灣區地緣相近、人緣相親，有着深厚的歷史淵源和共同文化基礎。江西贛南是客家先民從中原南遷的第一站，有「客家搖籃」的美譽。隨着客家族群南遷，在嶺南地區開枝散葉，並輾轉來到香港，成為香港四大民系之一，使客家文化逐漸成為香港市民日常生活的一部分，今天香港新界有不少的宗族都是源自江西。贛港兩地因客家文化而相連，同氣連枝，又各自發展出獨特的人文風貌，體現着中華民族的文化多樣性和延續性。

客家族群純樸熱情，取於自然，孕育出贛南客家擂茶製作技藝等世界級非遺；又發掘自然，匠心傳承如贛南客家服飾等國家級非遺。這次展演正好可以讓香港市民近距離了解和體驗江西的客家文化和傳統工藝，感受當地「物華天寶」的多樣魅力。同時亦促進兩地文化交流，如同展演主題－－「根與魂」，反映香港跟內地文化的同根同源。

「根與魂」展演系列來到第九屆，一直是國家和香港非遺保護的重點合作項目，是次展演有近40個江西非遺項目亮相，包括三項列入聯合國教科文組織《人類非遺代表作名錄》的項目和10個列入國家級非遺名錄項目。近70位江西非遺傳承人和展演人員來港，包括國家級非遺代表性傳承人、國家一級演員以及著名劇團，帶來超過100場的演出、示範、講座和互動體驗活動。今年的另一亮點就是承蒙中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室宣傳文體部的支持，「根與魂」互動體驗活動首次可延伸至本地校園內進行，讓中華文化傳承更深更廣。

除這次展演外，「香港非遺月」還有很多精彩節目，例如明日在沙田香港文化博物館舉辦的非遺高峰會，以及在荃灣香港非遺中心舉辦的同樂日，大家都不容錯過，眾多節目必定可以令大家感受到香港「處處有非遺」。

最後，我謹代表香港特區政府衷心感謝國家文化和旅遊部和中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室宣傳文體部全力支持這項活動。我也在這裏感謝江西省文化和旅遊廳、贛州市文化廣電旅遊局與萍鄉市文化廣電旅遊局通力合作和支持。我祝願這次展演活動圓滿成功，在座各位身體健康。

登革熱最新情況,2025-06-13 17:45,2025-06-13 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300691.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（六月十三日）公布登革熱個案的最新數字。鑑於本地氣溫及雨量隨着夏季來臨會逐漸上升，蚊患情況可能加劇，加上市民在暑假前往登革熱流行地區會較頻繁，因此本地登革熱的風險正在上升。根據食物環境衞生署資料，五月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數明顯上升。中心總監徐樂堅醫生呼籲市民提高警覺，不論在本地或外遊，應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。

由六月六日至昨日（六月十二日），中心錄得一宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期內曾到印度尼西亞。

截至昨日，今年錄得27宗外地傳入登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。二○二三年則錄得62宗外地傳入個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。在二○二三年，全球80多個國家及地區共呈報了逾650萬宗病例和7 300多宗登革熱相關死亡個案。世衞於二○二四年更錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點普遍流行，印度尼西亞、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年至今已各錄得超過一萬宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過2 000宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今在佛山和中山共錄得17宗本地病例。其中，中山在五月底的一周內（五月二十六日至六月一日）錄得六宗本地病例。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

市民如從受登革熱影響地區回港，應在14日內繼續使用昆蟲驅避劑。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節。

炎熱多雨的春夏月份（即五至九月）有利蚊子迅速繁殖。市民應繼續恆常的防蚊工作，並採取下列防蚊措施：


徹底檢查集水溝氣隔、屋頂雨水槽、明渠及排水渠，避免淤塞；
每星期至少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，以除去可能積聚的蚊卵；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，盡量避免使用墊碟；
在雨季前把凹凸不平的地面填平；
避免在叢林逗留；及
戶外活動期間，做好個人保護措施，穿着淺色長袖上衣和長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服上塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。


含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，市民應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%＊；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；及
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用。

＊如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺。

​​市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務登革熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁及YouTube頻道。"
Update on dengue fever,2025-06-13 17:45,2025-06-13 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300695.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (June 13) reported the latest number of dengue fever (DF) cases. As the local temperature and rainfall are rising gradually with the arrival of summer, the mosquito infestation may aggravate. In addition, members of public will travel to DF-endemic regions more frequently during the summer holiday. Therefore, the risk of DF in Hong Kong is increasing. According to the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, the monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in May has increased significantly. The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, urged the public to remain vigilant, and maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel.

  From June 6 to yesterday (June 12), the CHP recorded one imported DF case. The patient had travelled to Indonesia during the incubation period.

As of yesterday, 27 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases. In 2023, 62 imported cases of DF were recorded.

  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases and more than 7 300 dengue-related deaths were reported in over 80 countries/territories. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number.

  DF is prevalent in many neighboring tourist destinations. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 10 000 cases so far this year. Singapore also recorded over 2 000 cases. Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 17 local cases in Foshan and Zhongshan so far this year. Among these cases, six local cases were recorded in Zhongshan in a week in late May (from May 26 to June 1).

  Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

  Members of the public returning from areas affected by DF should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. If feeling unwell, seek medical advice promptly and provide travel details to a doctor.

  As mosquitoes breed quickly during hot and rainy spring and summer months (i.e. from May to September), members of the public are reminded to continue with routine mosquito prevention and control work, and take heed of the following advice on mosquito control:


Thoroughly check all gully traps, roof gutters, surface channels and drains to prevent blockage;
Scrub and clean drains and surface channels with an alkaline detergent compound at least once a week to remove any deposited mosquito eggs;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxes, in covered litter containers;
Completely change the water of flowers and plants at least once a week. The use of saucers should be avoided if possible;
Level irregular ground surfaces before the rainy season;
Avoid staying in shrubby areas; and
Take personal protective measures such as wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothes and trousers, and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or uncovered areas of the body when doing outdoor activities.

ââ
âDEET-containing insect repellents are effective and the public should take heed of the tips below:


Read the label instructions carefully first;
Apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
Apply on exposed skin and clothing;
Use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children*;
Apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent; and
Reapply only when needed and follow the instructions.

* For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the DF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook PageandYouTube Channel."

政務司司長出席民青局企業內地與海外暑期實習計劃2025啓動禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-06-13 17:29,2025-06-13 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300716.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（六月十三日）在民青局企業內地與海外暑期實習計劃2025啓動禮的致辭：

各位企業代表、各位嘉賓、各位青年朋友：

大家好！我今日非常高興，再次為民青局企業內地與海外暑期實習計劃主持啓動禮。首先，我熱烈歡迎合共28間參與企業的代表，以及在場所有獲選的青年實習生，和我們一起啓動新一輪的計劃。

這個暑期實習計劃自二○一八年推出以來，一直深受廣大青年的歡迎，以及一眾參與企業的肯定，至今已經有超過1 000名香港青年受惠。多年來，這個計劃匯聚政府和商界的力量，帶領香港的青年人「走出去」，透過暑期實習，讓他們累積職場經驗、擴闊視野、認識國家、放眼世界、同時建立人脈網絡，幫助他們規劃未來的發展方向。

關於今年的計劃亮點，我想用三個「高」字去形容。第一個「高」，是實習崗位數目創新「高」。今年的計劃提供超過400個實習崗位，遍布不同地方，包括多個粵港澳大灣區城市，以及北京、上海、成都、杭州等內地城市；亦涵蓋多個海外國家，包括新加坡、泰國、菲律賓、蒙古及澳洲等。

第二個「高」，是參與計劃的企業數目創新「高」。今年參加計劃的企業數目增加至28間，涵蓋的行業亦更加多元化。除金融、物流、地產、零售等傳統領域外，亦有深受青年人歡迎的互聯網科技、應用程式開發，影視娛樂等新興行業。實習崗位方面，今年更特別新增ESG，即是環境、社會和公司治理，以及再生能源、人工智能的相關崗位。同學可以按個人喜好，選報不同的行業及崗位。

我特別想強調一點，參與企業除了提供實習崗位外，更加投放不少資源，包括承擔實習生的主要開支，並委派專責同事為他們提供全面的培訓及支援。可以說，它們為培育香港新一代出心出力。在這裏，我代表特區政府，向所有參與企業，致以最衷心的謝意。謝謝你們！

第三個「高」，是報名人數創新「高」。今年計劃反應非常熱烈，吸引約3 100位同學報名參加，人數創歷年新高。這反映計劃深受青年人歡迎，亦充分展現香港青年追求進步、勇於接受挑戰的一面。

在這裏，我特別恭賀各位成功通過遴選的青年實習生，你們從眾多申請者之中脫穎而出，其實一點都不容易，正如剛才所說，有3 000多人報名參與，競爭非常激烈。我希望你們能好好把握今次寶貴的實習機會，在各自的崗位上努力裝備自己，積極了解不同地方的職場及生活文化，同時提升自身競爭力，發揮所長。

特區政府十分重視青年發展。我們的願景是培育香港青年成為愛國愛港、具備世界視野、有抱負和具正向思維的新一代。

自從我們在二○二二年年底公布《青年發展藍圖》以來，特區政府全力推進青年發展工作，落實《藍圖》提出的超過160項具體行動，並因應社會的最新發展情況，動態更新《藍圖》，「加推」約90項措施，全面支持青年人的發展，為他們提供更全面、更到位的支援。

《藍圖》的其中一項重點措施，是今屆政府起動的「連青人網絡」，「連」是連結的「連」，連結政府各項青年活動的參加者，為他們提供各式各樣的活動和培訓，以及參與公共事務的機會。在座各位同學在完成實習後，將會成為「連青人網絡」的成員，我十分鼓勵大家踴躍參與網絡的不同活動，發展多元才能。

展望未來，特區政府會繼續凝聚社會各界力量，做好培育青年的工作，讓他們茁壯成長，日後為國家和香港的發展作出貢獻。

最後，我祝願今年的實習計劃圓滿成功，所有同學有一個愉快和充實的實習之旅，學有所成。我亦再一次感謝所有參與企業與政府攜手合作，為香港青年開拓跨地域、跨界別的發展機遇。多謝大家！"

戴杰董事總經理（香港商報董事總經理）、劉斌處長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室經濟部貿易處投資組處長）、譚光舜主席（香港旅遊業議會主席）、各位旅業同仁、媒體朋友：

大家下午好。

我非常高興出席2025大灣區旅遊業十優評選頒獎典禮暨文旅推介會。我首先代表文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局），衷心祝賀第八屆2025大灣區旅遊業十優評選的成功舉辦，並向今日獲獎的單位與人士表示恭賀。

香港作為粵港澳大灣區的核心城市之一，一直致力於發揮「國際窗口」和「超級聯繫人」的作用。香港特區政府按照國家規劃文件的指導方向，在《香港旅遊業發展藍圖2.0》的基礎上，積極配合國家整體規劃發展，致力推動文體旅融合發展，全力鞏固香港成為國際城市旅遊樞紐及「一程多站」示範核心區，落實「以文塑旅、以旅彰文」的概念。

在推動大灣區旅遊合作方面，特區政府與國家文化和旅遊部、廣東省文化和旅遊廳及粵港澳大灣區各市的旅遊部門攜手合作，共同落實重點工作，共建世界級休閒灣‍區。

文體旅局會持續透過香港旅遊發展局（旅發局），以多管齊下的策略推動大灣區「一程多站」旅遊，吸引更多旅客以香港作為他們在大灣區旅途中的首站或中轉地。其中包括旅發局會繼續與業界推出涵蓋大灣區城市行程的旅遊產品或優惠套票，吸引旅客在來往其他目的地時，順道遊覽香港。旅發局亦會積極與大灣區旅遊單位合作，聯合推廣區內盛事，例如剛於上星期香港國際龍舟邀請賽舉辦的粵港澳大灣區錦標賽，便雲集大灣區各城市的龍舟好手，促進大灣區內城市文化交流與合作，強化香港作為大灣區內國際旅遊盛事中心的角色。

過去一年，大灣區文旅業展現了強勢發展。香港與灣區各城市在政策協同、資源整合、品牌聯動等方面取得了顯著突破，「一程多站」的精品旅遊路線，將香港的國際都市魅力和大灣區各城市的歷史文化風情相結合，深受海外旅客歡迎，成為推動灣區文旅合作的重要成果，這一切的背後，離不開灣區業界的智慧與創新。

今日的十優評選，正是對業界卓越表現的最佳肯定。我非常高興知道今日獲獎的項目涵蓋旅遊景點、餐飲酒店、零售業、服務及線上訂購平台等多個範疇，充分體現了服務品質的精益求精，更彰顯了灣區文旅業從「競合」走向「共贏」的新格局。

香港商報舉辦這一盛會，不僅為大灣區旅遊業搭建了交流平台，更彰顯了業界在創新發展、服務提升中的卓越成就。我希望業界繼續保持識變、應變、求變的精神，積極擁抱新趨勢、開拓新市場、提升服務質素，攜手將大灣區打造成為「最具活力、最具魅力、最具影響力」的世界級文化旅遊目的地。

謝謝大家。"
反非法勞工行動拘十五人（附圖）,2025-06-13 16:45,2025-06-13 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300643.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於六月九日至昨日（六月十二日）一連四日在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，分別是代號「促進行動」、「光影行動」和「曙光行動」，與及聯同香港警務處執行的「風沙行動」。行動中共拘捕十二名懷疑非法勞工、兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及一名涉嫌協助及教唆者。

反非法勞工行動中，入境處特遣隊人員搜查了八十一個目標地點，包括商業大廈、工業大廈、住宅大廈、按摩店、餐廳及零售店，共拘捕十二名懷疑非法勞工、兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及一名涉嫌協助及教唆者。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為五男七女，年齡介乎二十一歲至五十七歲。當中兩男一女持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）。另外，一名女子涉嫌行使及管有懷疑偽造身份證；一名男子亦涉嫌行使及管有他人身份證。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為一男一女，年齡分別為三十歲及六十三歲。因涉嫌協助及教唆他人在港違反逗留條件而被捕的為一名三十二歲女子。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"
15 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photo),2025-06-13 16:45,2025-06-13 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300645.htm,"The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Contribute"", ""Lightshadow"" and ""Twilight"", and a joint operation with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Windsand"", for four consecutive days from June 9 to yesterday (June 12). A total of 12 suspected illegal workers, two suspected employers and one suspected aider and abettor were arrested.

During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD Task Force officers raided 81 target locations including commercial buildings, an industrial building, residential buildings, a massage parlour, restaurants and retail stores. Twelve suspected illegal workers, two suspected employers and one suspected aider and abettorwere arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised five men and seven women, aged 21 to 57. Among them, two men and one woman were holders of a recognisance form, which prohibits them from taking any employment. In addition, one woman was also suspected of using and being in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card; one man was suspected of using and being in possession of a Hong Kong identity card related to another person. One man and one woman, aged 30 and 63, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested. One woman, aged 32, who was suspected of aiding and abetting a person who breached the condition of stay in Hong Kong, was also arrested.

An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged Hong Kong identity card or a Hong Kong identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."

二○二四年十二月二十五日至二○二五年四月十六日期間的貨幣發行局運作報告
—————————————————————————————

貨幣發行委員會（委員會）獲悉，於報告期內，港元兌美元在7.7555至7.7927之間上落。隨着二○二四年年底流動性緊絀情況減退及全球市場對美國宣布關稅政策作出的反應，港元匯率在二○二五年一月初稍為轉弱，然而在二○二五年二月中旬，受到中國內地近期在人工智能領域取得的進展及港股通南向資金淨流入的推動，本地股市表現強勁，支持港元轉強。在四月初，面對美國進一步加徵關稅，長倉美元的外匯交易因避險情緒而平倉，加上南向資金持續流入，港元進一步轉強。港元銀行同業拆息繼續跟隨美元利率走勢，較短期的拆息同時亦受本地供求情況影響。短期香港銀行同業拆息在接近年底時一度收緊，但其後隨着資金需求減退而回軟。兌換保證於報告期內沒有被觸發，總結餘維持穩定，約為450億港元；貼現窗的使用情況未見異常。整體而言，港元外匯及銀行同業市場交易繼續暢順有序。

委員會獲悉，於報告期末時貨幣基礎增加至19,809.9億港元。貨幣基礎的所有變動與外匯儲備的變動完全一致，符合貨幣發行局制度的原則。

報告期內貨幣發行局制度的運作報告載於附件。

對風險及不穩定因素的監察
————————————

委員會注意到，隨着美國宣布施加遠超市場預期的對等關稅，環球經濟增長放緩的風險上升。環球金融市場表現波動，但繼續暢順運作，無跡象顯示存在廣泛的融資壓力。儘管延遲實施對等關稅為普遍面對較高稅率的出口依賴型亞洲經濟體帶來一定程度的緩解，但日後會實施關稅的可能性仍對經濟增長構成重大阻力。

委員會注意到，踏入二○二五年，中國內地經濟出現復蘇跡象，股票市場氣氛亦有所改善。尤其在三月召開的全國兩會上，有關當局傳遞了穩增長的強烈信號，包括優先推動消費及加強財政支持。自四月以來，受到美國的對等關稅影響，內地經濟前景面對較嚴峻的外圍不利因素。預期中國內地會更着力提振消費。

委員會注意到，隨着美國施加對等關稅，香港經濟的增長前景面對的下行風險有所加劇。然而，多項因素在一定程度上有助減輕相關影響，包括內地的促進經濟增長政策及人工智能領域取得的進展、市場對美國減息的預期，以及入境旅遊業的持續復蘇。另一方面，隨着政府調整樓價較低物業的印花稅，住宅物業市場成交量在三月有所增加，但市場氣氛在四月因環球金融市場波動而轉趨審慎。商用物業市場仍然疲弱，尤其是寫字樓物業。

有關「貼現窗標籤效應」的研究
——————————————

委員會備悉一份關於在一段期間內香港金融管理局（金管局）貼現窗的使用率及銀行面對與其相關的「標籤效應」的研究報告。研究結果顯示，與之前2018至2020年流動性緊絀的期間相比，在當前流動性緊絀的期間，銀行更頻密地使用貼現窗，相關的「標籤效應」亦同時有所減退。這個趨勢與金管局近期積極與銀行溝通以緩減其對「標籤效應」的顧慮吻合。"

Record of discussion of meeting of Exchange Fund Advisory Committee Currency Board Sub-Committee held on April 30,2025-06-13 16:36,2025-06-13 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061100634.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

(Approved for Issue by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee by circulation)

Report on Currency Board Operations (25 December, 2024 - 16 April, 2025)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Currency Board Sub-Committee (Sub-Committee) noted that the Hong Kong dollar (HKD) traded within a range of 7.7555 - 7.7927 against the US dollar (USD) during the review period. The HKD exchange rate moderated in early January 2025 as liquidity tightness subsided at the end of 2024 and global markets reacted to US tariff announcements, but strengthened in mid-February 2025, supported by strong performance of the local stock market amid Mainland China's recent advancements in artificial intelligence and net inflows from the Southbound Stock Connect. In early April, in response to further US tariffs, the HKD strengthened further as long USD carry trades unwound amid a risk-off sentiment and southbound inflows continued. HKD interbank rates (HIBORs) continued to track the USD rates while shorter-tenor rates were also being affected by local supply and demand. Short-term HIBORs tightened briefly near the year-end but softened thereafter as funding demand faded. The Convertibility Undertakings were not triggered during the review period and the Aggregate Balance was stable at around HK$45 billion. No abnormality was noted in the usage of the Discount Window. Overall, the HKD exchange and interbank markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.

The Sub-Committee noted that the Monetary Base increased to HK$1,980.99 billion at the end of the review period. In accordance with the Currency Board principles, all changes in the Monetary Base had been fully matched by changes in foreign reserves.

The Report on Currency Board Operations for the review period is at Annex.

Monitoring of Risks and Vulnerabilities
------------------------------------------

The Sub-Committee noted that downside growth risks to the global economy had intensified following the US announcement of imposing reciprocal tariffs that exceeded market expectations. In response, global financial markets had gyrated, although they continued to operate smoothly with no sign of widespread funding stress. While the postponement of reciprocal tariffs had offered some reprieve for export-reliant Asian economies which generally faced higher rates, the prospect of tariffs being implemented further down the road still posed significant growth headwinds.

The Sub-Committee noted that in Mainland China, the economy entered 2025 amid some green shoots and improved equity market sentiment. In particular, at the ""two sessions"" in March, the authorities sent strong pro-growth signals, including prioritising consumption and strengthening fiscal support. From April onwards, the Mainland economic outlook faced stiffer external headwinds due to the US reciprocal tariffs. It was expected that Mainland China would place increasing emphasis on supporting consumption.

The Sub-Committee noted that in Hong Kong, downside risks to the growth outlook heightened following the imposition of the US reciprocal tariffs. Yet, several factors might help alleviate some of the impact, including the Mainland's pro-growth policies and its advancement in artificial intelligence, the prospective US rate cuts expected by the markets, and the ongoing recovery of inbound tourism. Meanwhile, housing market transactions gained momentum in March following the Government's adjustment in stamp duties for lower-value properties, although market sentiment turned conservative in early April amid the global financial market volatility. The commercial real estate markets remained subdued, especially in the office segment.

A Study on ""Discount Window Stigma""
-------------------------------------------

The Sub-Committee noted a paper that examined the usage of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA)Discount Window and the associated ""stigma effect"" by banks over time. The results showed that the Discount Window was tapped more frequently and the associated stigma diminished in the current period of tight liquidity, compared with the previous period of tight liquidity in 2018 - 2020. This trend coincided with the HKMA's proactive communication efforts with banks to alleviate concerns about the ""stigma effect"" during recent periods."

Upon the HKU's completion of the review and engagement with the community on the revised proposal, further rezoning of the site will be processed in accordance with the Town Planning Ordinance.

Other amendments include rezoning narrow strips of land along Victoria Road and a strip of land to the south of Wah Mei House, Wah Fu Estate, to suitable zonings to reflect the existing alignment of Victoria Road and the land grant boundary of Wah Fu Estate.

The Notes and Explanatory Statement of the OZP have been amended taking into account the above amendments. Opportunity is also taken to update the general information of various land use zones and the planning circumstances, where appropriate.

  Compared with the grading released last week, Lido Beach has been upgraded from Grade 2 to Grade 1. Discovery Bay Tai Pak Beach and Kadoorie Beach have been changed from Grade 1 to Grade 2.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

27名分間單位規管租賃業主因違反相關法例規定而被定罪,2025-06-13 15:48,2025-06-13 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300597.htm,"27名分間單位業主因違反《業主與租客（綜合）條例》（第7章）第IVA部（《條例》）的相關規定，於六月六日及今日（六月十三日）在東區裁判法院承認有關控罪，並被判處罰款共75,700元。自《條例》生效以來，差餉物業估價署（估價署）持續加強採取執法行動，至今已合共檢控1 077宗個案，而就法庭已處理的742宗個案，均全數成功定罪，共涉及646名分間單位業主，罰款介乎400元至34,800元，合計總罰款共1,841,610元，另有335宗個案則正等待進行聆訊。

該27名業主的罪行包括（一）沒有在規管租賃的租期開始後的60日內，向估價署署長提交租賃通知書（表格AR2）；及（二）要求租客支付不屬《條例》所准許的種類的款項（即要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額）。其中一名業主觸犯上述（一）及（二）項共16宗罪行而被判處罰款13,000元。

估價署於早前發現這些業主涉嫌違反《條例》的相關規定。經深入調查及搜集證據後，估價署向這些業主提出檢控。

估價署發言人重申，分間單位業主必須嚴格遵守《條例》下的相關規定，包括禁止業主刻意打擾租戶成員的安寧或舒適生活等，意圖使租客放棄佔用其分間單位；要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額；同時提醒租客在《條例》下所享有的權益，包括四年（即兩年加兩年）的租住權保障。他亦強調估價署會繼續堅決執法，打擊任何違例個案。估價署除了跟進舉報個案，亦一直以多管齊下的方式主動識別、調查及跟進有關業主涉嫌違反《條例》規定的個案。就此，估價署要求規管租賃的業主提供與租賃有關的資料及參考文件，以核實他們是否已遵從《條例》的規定。如業主無合理辯解而拒絕提供相關資料或忽略署方要求，即屬違法，最高可處第三級罰款（10,000元）及監禁三個月。因應實際情況和所蒐集的資料及證據，估價署會對個別個案採取適當行動，包括就涉嫌觸犯《條例》下罪行的個案提出檢控。此外，估價署已展開新一輪宣傳教育工作，加強宣傳《條例》下主要罪行及刑罰，並強調會主動審查業主有否觸犯《條例》下罪行。

為幫助盡早遏止違法行為，市民應盡快向估價署舉報涉嫌違規個案。舉報渠道包括電話熱線（2150 8303）、電郵（enquiries@rvd.gov.hk）、傳真（2116 4920）、郵寄（九龍長沙灣道303號長沙灣政府合署15樓）或親身到訪（香港灣仔告士打道7號入境事務大樓38樓3816-22室，估價署租務科辦公室，到訪前請先致電2150 8303預約）。此外，估價署亦已於其網頁提供一份表格（表格AR4）（www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/tc/forms/ar4.pdf），便利分間單位租客向估價署作出舉報。

估價署提醒，根據《條例》，規管租賃的規管周期，須由該分間單位的連續兩項規管租賃（即首期租賃及次期租賃）所組成，而每項規管租賃的租期為兩年。分間單位首期租賃的租客有權獲授予有關規管周期中的次期租賃，從而享有總共四年的租住權保障。估價署陸續按照首期租賃屆滿的時間，分批發信給相關規管租賃的業主和租客並夾附有關資訊，旨在協助他們了解次期租賃的重要事項，並提醒應在擬達成的次期租賃開始前約兩個月須遵從的程序，以及在《條例》下的相關義務和權益。有關業主及租客亦可瀏覽估價署網站內的次期租賃專頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html）的相關資料，包括「一圖看清」、小冊子、教學短片及常見問題。有關業主及租客亦應熟悉相關的法定要求，以及就次期租賃保持密切溝通，並按《條例》適切處理有關事宜。

27 landlords of subdivided units under regulated tenancies convicted of contravening relevant statutory requirements,2025-06-13 15:48,2025-06-13 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300600.htm,"  Twenty-seven landlords of subdivided units (SDUs), who contravened Part IVA of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7), pleaded guilty and were fined a total of $75,700 on June 6 and today (June 13) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. Since the Ordinance came into force, the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) has continuously strengthened enforcement actions and has prosecuted a total of 1 077 cases to date. Among the 742 cases dealt with by the court, all were successfully convicted, which involved a total of 646 SDU landlords with fines ranging from $400 to $34,800, amounting to a total of $1,841,610. In addition, 335 cases are pending a hearing.

  The offences of these 27 landlords include (1) failing to submit a Notice of Tenancy (Form AR2) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation within 60 days after the term of the regulated tenancy commenced; and (2) requesting the tenant to pay money other than the types permitted under the Ordinance (i.e. requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance). One of the landlords committed 16 offences under (1) and (2) and was fined $13,000.

  The RVD earlier discovered that the landlords failed to comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance. Upon an in-depth investigation and evidence collection, the RVD prosecuted the landlords.

  A spokesman for the RVD reiterated that SDU landlords must comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance, including prohibiting landlords from doing any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of members of the tenant's household, with the intention of causing the tenant to give up occupation of the SDU; or requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance, and also reminded tenants of their rights under the Ordinance, including a four-year (i.e. two years plus two years) security of tenure. He also stressed that the RVD will continue to take resolute enforcement action against any contraventions of the Ordinance. Apart from following up on reported cases, the RVD has been adopting a multipronged approach to proactively identify, investigate and follow up on cases concerning landlords who are suspected of contravening the Ordinance. In particular, the RVD has been requiring landlords of regulated tenancies to provide information and reference documents of their tenancies for checking whether they have complied with the requirements of the Ordinance. If a landlord, without reasonable excuse, refuses to provide the relevant information or neglects the RVD's request, the landlord commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine at level 3 ($10,000) and to imprisonment for three months. Depending on the actual circumstances, and having regard to the information and evidence collected, the RVD will take appropriate actions on individual cases, including instigating prosecution against suspected contraventions of the Ordinance. In addition, the RVD has started a new round of publicity and education work to enhance public awareness about the key offences and penalties, emphasising that the RVD proactively checks whether landlords have committed the offences under the Ordinance.

  To help curb illegal acts as soon as possible, members of the public should report to the RVD promptly any suspected cases of contravening the relevant requirements. Reporting can be made through the telephone hotline (2150 8303), by email (enquiries@rvd.gov.hk), by fax (2116 4920), by post (15/F, Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, 303 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon), or in person (visiting the Tenancy Services Section office of the RVD at Room 3816-22, 38/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, and please call 2150 8303 to make an appointment). Furthermore, the RVD has provided a form (Form AR4) (www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/ar4.pdf) on its website to facilitate SDU tenants' reporting to the RVD.

  The RVD reminds that pursuant to the Ordinance, a regulated cycle of regulated tenancies is to comprise two consecutive regulated tenancies (i.e. the first-term tenancy and second-term tenancy) for an SDU, and the term of each regulated tenancy is two years. A tenant of a first-term tenancy for an SDU is entitled to be granted a second-term tenancy of the regulated cycle, thus enjoying a total of four years of security of tenure. The RVD has been issuing letters enclosing relevant information to the landlords and tenants concerned of regulated tenancies in batches, according to the expiry time of their first-term tenancies, to assist them in understanding the important matters pertaining to the second-term tenancy, and to remind them about the procedures that need to be followed about two months prior to the commencement of the purported second-term tenancy as well as their respective obligations and rights under the Ordinance. These landlords and tenants may also visit the dedicated page for the second-term tenancy on the RVD's website (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html) for the relevant information, including a concise guide, brochures, tutorial videos and frequently asked questions. The landlords and tenants concerned are also advised to familiarise themselves with the relevant statutory requirements and maintain close communication regarding the second-term tenancy for handling the matters properly and in a timely manner according to the Ordinance.

  For enquiries related to regulated tenancies, please call the telephone hotline (2150 8303) or visit the RVD's webpage (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/our_services/part_iva.html) for the relevant information."
