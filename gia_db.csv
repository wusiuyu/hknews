一名六十三歲的女旅客昨日從塞拉利昂自由城經埃塞俄比亞阿迪斯阿貝巴飛抵本港。海關人員清關時，在其寄艙行李箱的夾層內發現該批懷疑可卡因，遂把她拘捕。

被捕女子已被控以一項販運危險藥物，案件將於八月十一日在西九龍裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。

海關會繼續根據風險管理的原則，重點揀選來自高風險地區的旅客作清關檢查，確保有效打擊跨境販毒活動。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。

HKSAR Government opposes slanderous remarks by the United States and members of G7 Rapid Response Mechanism on HKSAR's lawful act to pursue wanted persons endangering national security absconding from Hong Kong,2025-08-09 12:53,2025-08-09 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900338.htm,"In response to the untrue and biased remarks made by the United States and members of the Group of Seven Rapid Response Mechanism (G7 RRM) (including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the European Union) and G7 RRM associate members regarding the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)'s lawful act to pursue wanted persons endangering national security absconding from Hong Kong, the HKSAR Government today (August 9) expressed strong dissatisfaction and opposition.

A spokesman said, ""Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong National Security Law) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security. The rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press and of publication, and the freedoms of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, enjoyed by Hong Kong residents under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applicable to the HKSAR are protected in accordance with the law. Legislation that safeguards national security only targets a very small number of organisations and individuals that endanger national security.""

The spokesman also pointed out, ""The National Security Department of the Hong Kong Police Force announced on July 25 that 16 absconders, and Yuan Gong-yi, Fok Ka-chi and Choi Ming-da, who were specified as absconders in June and December 2024, had been put on wanted list. These 19 absconders are suspected of having committed offences under the Hong Kong National Security Law by organising, establishing, or participating in, outside the HKSAR, a subversive organisation named the 'Hong Kong Parliament'. The court has, upon application by the Police, issued arrest warrants against these 19 persons at large. The Secretary for Security had, on August 4, exercised the powers conferred by the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance to specify the above 16 persons as absconders, and specified the measures to be applied against the 16 relevant absconders by notices published in the Gazette.""

The spokesman said, ""Those absconders hiding outside Hong Kong are wanted and subject to arrest warrants issued by the court, not because they 'exercised freedom of expression', but because they continue to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security there. The 'Hong Kong Parliament' is an organisation aiming to subvert the state power. Its objectives include promoting 'self-determination', promulgating the so-called 'Hong Kong Constitution', and overthrowing or undermining the basic system of the People's Republic of China established by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China or overthrowing the body of the central power of People's Republic of China or the body of power of the HKSAR, etc. with unlawful means. We therefore have taken such measures to make a significant impact.""

""Endangering national security is a very serious offence. Such acts and activities could bring very serious consequences. The HKSAR Government has the responsibility to pursue, in accordance with the law, persons suspected of having committed offences under the Hong Kong National Security Law or other offences endangering national security outside Hong Kong. It is indeed a demonstration of hypocrisy with double standards by any external forces or people with ulterior motives that, after the HKSAR Government has announced the relevant measures, attack the HKSAR in safeguarding national security dutifully, faithfully and in accordance with the law.""

""The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, and have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation. The HKSAR Government has the responsibility to pursue those who are suspected to have committed offences endangering national security and absconded overseas in accordance with the law.""

""Absconders should not think they can evade criminal liability by absconding from Hong Kong. Ultimately, they will be liable for their acts constituting serious offences endangering national security and be sanctioned by the law. Any suggestion that certain individuals or organisations should be immune from legal consequences for their illegal acts is no different from advocating a special privilege to break the law, and this totally runs contrary to the spirit of the rule of law,"" the spokesman stressed.

The spokesman reiterated, ""The Constitution and the Basic Law steadfastly safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents. Any attempt by foreign countries or external forces to undermine Hong Kong's situation will only expose their own weakness and faulty arguments and be doomed to fail. The HKSAR Government will continue to unwaveringly discharge its duty in safeguarding national security."""
食環署公布八月份第一批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數,2025-08-09 12:10,2025-08-09 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900279.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（八月九日）表示，為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險，食環署會加強白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數的資訊發放。

食環署早前已公布七月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，並正持續在不同監察地區展開八月份的蚊患調查。當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的地區誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊。

屯門區掃管笏的指數達16.4%，食環署會按因應基孔肯雅熱情況而實施的安排（即將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域），聯同有關部門及持份者攜手強化滅蚊工作，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。食環署亦會舉辦宣傳展覽、派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

市民應採取以下措施，加強防範蚊子滋生：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除所有多餘積水，並消除滲漏源頭；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，清除盤栽墊碟裏的水；
蓋好所有盛水容器；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；及
鋪平或填補不平坦的地面及孔洞。


食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"
FEHD releases first batch of gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus in August,2025-08-09 12:10,2025-08-09 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900280.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) announced today (August 9) that it will enhance the dissemination of gravidtrap index data to allow more citizens to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

The FEHD has previously announced the gravidtrap index data in July and is currently conducting mosquito infestation surveys in various survey areas for August. Once the surveys are completed in individual survey areas and the latest gravidtrap and density indices are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media.

The first batch of gravidtrap index and density index for August, covering 13 survey areas, is as follows:

The index in So Kwun Wat, Tuen Mun District, reached 16.4 per cent. In response to the recent CF situation, the FEHD has activated a mechanism that strengthen mosquito control work in areas with the gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, which was originally activated when the gravidtrap index reaches 20% or above. The FEHD will collaborate with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with high mosquito infestation, and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. The FEHD will also organise exhibitions, distribute leaflets and posters, and notify the residential estates subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures.

Members of public should adopt the following measures, strengthening the prevention against the breeding of mosquitoes:


Tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water in containers inside their premises;
Remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
Completely change the water in flower vases at least once a week and remove the water on the plant saucers;
Properly cover all containers that hold water;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxes, in covered litter containers; and
Level irregular ground surfaces and holes.


Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools, to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."
特區政府反對美國和七國集團快速反應機制成員國就特區依法緝捕潛逃境外危害國家安全分子的抹黑言論,2025-08-09 11:15,2025-08-09 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900285.htm,"​香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（八月九日）就美國、七國集團快速反應機制成員國（包括加拿大、法國、德國、意大利、日本、英國及歐盟）和關聯成員國就有關特區依法緝捕潛逃境外危害國家安全分子的不實和偏頗言論，表示強烈不滿和反對。

發言人指出：「《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區維護國家安全法》（《香港國安法》）和《維護國家安全條例》均明確規定維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，亦依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》，以及《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港特區的有關規定下享有的權利和自由，包括言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會、遊行、示威等自由。維護國家安全的法例只針對極少部分的危害國家安全的組織和個人。」

發言人亦指出：「警務處國家安全處已於七月二十五日公布懸紅通緝十六名潛逃者，以及已於二○二四年六月和十二月先後被指明為潛逃者的袁弓夷、霍嘉誌及蔡明達。這十九名潛逃者在境外籌組、成立或參與一個名為『香港議會』的顛覆組織，涉嫌干犯《香港國安法》罪行。法院已應警方的申請，就上述十九名在逃人士發出拘捕令。保安局局長亦已於八月四日行使《維護國家安全條例》所賦予的權力，藉在憲報刊登公告，指明上述十六名潛逃者，並指明針對這十六名有關潛逃者施行的措施。」

發言人表示：「該等潛藏境外的潛逃者被通緝和被法院發出拘捕令，並非因為他們『行使發表的自由』，而是因為他們在當地繼續公然從事危害國家安全的勾當。『香港議會』是一個旨在顛覆國家政權的組織，其目標包括推動『自決』、制定所謂『香港憲法』，以非法手段推翻、破壞《中華人民共和國憲法》所確立的中華人民共和國根本制度或推翻中華人民共和國中央政權機關或者特區政權機關等，因此有需要採取是次措施強烈打擊。」

「危害國家安全是非常嚴重的罪行，該類行為或活動可能造成極為嚴重的後果。特區政府有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌干犯《香港國安法》及其他危害國家安全罪行的人。任何外部勢力及別有用心人士，在特區政府提出相關措施後，詆毀盡責、忠誠和依法維護國家安全的香港特區，實乃典型的虛偽『雙標』。」

「香港特區執法部門一直根據證據、嚴格依照法律，以及按有關的人或單位的行為而採取執法行動，與其政治立場、背景或職業無關。特區政府有責任依法追究涉嫌干犯危害國家安全罪行並潛逃海外的人。」

發言人強調：「潛逃者不要妄想潛逃離港就可以逃避刑責。他們最終都需要為其危害國家安全的嚴重犯罪行為負上責任，受到法律制裁。任何倡議某些人或組織不應就其違法行為承擔其法律後果，等同給予其犯法特權，這完全違反法治精神。」

發言人重申：「香港居民的人權和自由受《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實保障。任何外國或外部勢力企圖詆毀香港情況，只會理屈詞窮，絕不會得逞。特區政府定當繼續堅定履職，維護國家安全。」"

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-09 06:46,2025-08-09 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900004.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 9) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

InvestHK leads start-up delegation to Bangkok to attend Techsauce Global Summit 2025 and promote two-way investment (with photos),2025-08-08 22:57,2025-08-08 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800673.htm," StartmeupHK, an initiative by Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) dedicated to helping start-ups establish a presence in the city, concluded a successful business mission to the Techsauce Global Summit 2025, held from August 4 to 6 in Bangkok, Thailand.

 Led by InvestHK, the delegation of 16 start-ups fostered meaningful connections not only with Thai corporates, investors, and tech leaders, but also among themselves, highlighting opportunities for cross-border collaboration and reinforcing Hong Kong's position as a leading start-up hub.

 The Techsauce Global Summit, held annually in Bangkok, is Southeast Asia's premier technology event, uniting global tech leaders, start-ups, investors, and corporates. With a mission to position Thailand as the Digital Gateway of Southeast Asia, the summit fosters networking, knowledge exchanges, and business opportunities across diverse sectors.

 This year's event attracted thousands of participants from across Asia Pacific, creating a dynamic environment for collaboration and innovation. The delegation's visit included site visits to four major Thai companies, facilitating discussions on potential collaborations in areas such as financial technology (fintech), digital transformation, and smart city solutions.

 The Head of Investment Promotion, Bangkok, at InvestHK, Mr Panakorn Dejthumrongwat, said, ""The Techsauce Global Summit 2025 highlighted the energy and potential of Southeast Asia's start-up ecosystem. This mission was a valuable opportunity to showcase what Hong Kong offers Thai start-ups looking to scale up, while also helping Hong Kong companies connect with Thai corporates and partners. It reflects the two-way opportunities for collaboration and growth, with Hong Kong serving as both a springboard to global markets and a gateway for inbound innovation to Asia.""

Showcasing Hong Kong's start-up ecosystem

 Senior Vice President of Startups at InvestHK, Mr Chin Yung Lu joined the fireside chat ""Tech in Hong Kong, and to the World: A Market Expansion Guide"" at the summit, alongside Hong Kong fintech start-up WealthRyse's Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder, Mr David Lee.

 They highlighted Hong Kong's strengths for Thai and Southeast Asian start-ups, including its open and business-friendly environment, strong common-law legal system, and proximity to Mainland China via the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area). The speakers also emphasised Hong Kong's role as a strategic launch pad for international expansion, with access to global funding, a deep talent pool and supportive government policies that foster entrepreneurship and cross-border growth.

Global Fast Track Thailand Regional Round 2025

 On August 5, the Global Fast Track Thailand Regional Round 2025 pitching session saw eight innovative start-ups take the stage to present their innovative solutions. Eazy Digital was selected as the winner for its AI-powered solutions that are reshaping the insurance and brokerage sectors.

 The company secured a coveted spot in the semi-finals of the Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025, to be held in November 2025 in Hong Kong, offering a platform to gain further exposure and investment opportunities.

Hong Kong business mission: engaging Thai corporates and start-ups

 On August 6, the delegation visited four leading Thai corporates and venture capital firms, with a focus on proptech collaboration. The meetings with Magnolia Quality Development Corporation Limited, ECG Ventures, All Seasons Property, and Asset World Corporation offered in-depth insights into each company's vision and business operations, while also highlighting potential avenues for engagement and collaboration with start-ups in their respective sectors.

 Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Inspekly, Mr Steven Cheng said, ""The mission to Bangkok, hosted by InvestHK, was a valuable stepping stone into a new market. It gave us the rare opportunity to connect directly with leading real estate developers in Bangkok - an experience many businesses aspire to. We're grateful for the exposure and meaningful connections made possible through this mission.""

 Co-founder of Green Vigor Limited, Ms Penney Chong commented, ""This was a unique opportunity to showcase our green tech to Thai real estate leaders and investors. It helped us raise international visibility and build connections that will support our future growth in the region.""

 The Business Development/Sales Lead - South East Asia of Carnot Innovations Limited, Mr TS Velan, added, ""It was an awesome Thailand business mission. Direct C-suite connections in Thailand gave a good head start for growth start-ups like us who are expanding in the Thai market and the region.""

 The StartmeupHK delegation to Techsauce Global Summit 2025 underscores Hong Kong's commitment to fostering two-way innovation and collaboration with Southeast Asia. Hong Kong's start-up landscape has exhibited remarkable growth, continuing its upward trend from 2024.

 Despite external challenges, the findings from InvestHK's 2024 Startup Survey revealed that the total number of start-ups has surged to 4,694, employing 17,651 individuals - a record high that underscores the ecosystem's vitality.

 The encouraging results reflect Hong Kong's allure for start-up founders, bolstered by several key advantages. Hong Kong offers a simple tax system with a low tax rate, provides excellent accessibility to funding and access to the vast Mainland China market, particularly through Hong Kong's role as a gateway to the Greater Bay Area.

 By leveraging its position as a global financial hub, a gateway to the Greater Bay Area, and a nurturing environment for start-ups, Hong Kong continues to attract and empower entrepreneurs to achieve global success."
CHP investigates one new case and one probable case of chikungunya fever (with photos),2025-08-08 21:40,2025-08-08 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800846.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 8) announced that one new imported case and one probable case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded, as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the recent CF cases. The CHP reminded members of the public to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

The confirmed imported case involved a 66-year-old female with underlying illnesses, living in Kwai Tsing District. Initial investigations revealed that the patient travelled alone to Foshan in Guangdong Province between July 24 and August 5, but did not recall a history of mosquito bites during the stay. She developed fever, rash and joint pain since August 6. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Yan Chai Hospital yesterday (August 7) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment on the same day. She is currently in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for CF virus upon laboratory testing.

Since the patient stayed in Foshan during the whole incubation period, the CHP considered that the patient was infected during travel, and the case was classified as an imported case. She has no travel collaterals, and her household contacts are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance. The CHP's epidemiological investigations is ongoing and has reported the case to the health authorities of Guangdong.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) is conducting vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations and will intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residence of the above patient, as well as locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in the scrubby areas within 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspection of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


Another probable case involves a 22-year-old female with good past health. She lives in Eastern District. Initial investigations revealed that she travelled oversea between July 16 and August 4 (July 16 to 28: Madagascar; July 28 to August 3: Mauritius; August 3 to 4: Malaysia), then arrived Hong Kong on August 4. She recalled a history of mosquito bites during the stay in Madagascar. She developed fever, headache and multiple joint pain in Madagascar since July 25 and rash over four limbs since July 30. Her fever had subsided before returning to Hong Kong. After returning to Hong Kong, she sought medical attention due to joint pain at the Accident and Emergency Department of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on August 4 and was admitted for treatment on the following day (August 5). She was discharged on August 7.

The patient's blood sample collected on August 4 tested negative in nucleic acid testing, while the blood sample collected on August 5 tested positive today for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to CF virus. The case is likely a recovered case. The CHP considered that the patient was no longer infectious to mosquito upon her return to Hong Kong. The CHP will arrange for a blood sample to be collected from the patient next week for a second antibody testing. If there is a more than four-fold increase in the antibody titre against the CF virus when compared with the first specimen, the case will be classified as a confirmed case.

A total of five CF cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year, all of which were imported cases, and another probable case has been recorded. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

According to the World Health Organization, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. As of July this year, over 240 000 cases had been reported in 16 countries/regions worldwide. Of these cases, about 90 were fatal.

The DH has enhanced publicity and education efforts regarding CF targeting different groups. The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures, and also distributes leaflets to travellers.The Port Health Division staff members has recently reminded MTR Corporation, cross-boundary coach and ferry companies operators and the Airport Authority Hong Kong to strengthen anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division also conduct temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fever or related symptoms will be assessed for their health condition and referred to hospitals for follow-up when necessary.

To raise the awareness of the elderly on preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at the health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres, and reminding residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service has promoted information of CF prevention at more than 300 health promotion activities provided to the elderly and their carers. In addition, the Elderly Health Service has arranged for the distribution of relevant leaflets at Elderly Health Centres across the 18 districts, with a view to helping the elderly to learn about the symptoms of CF and enhance their awareness of prevention of CF. The Family Health Service has also advised pregnant women and infant carers at its Maternal and Child Health Centres about precautions for preventing CF. The Student Health Service will distribute promotional leaflets to students at its Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres so that students could learn more about symptoms of CF.

The Health Promotion Branch is committed to disseminating health information on the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases (including CF) to the public through multiple channels. Measures include setting up Info Stations across various districts in Hong Kong (www.chp.gov.hk/en/other/events/476.html) and distributing relevant health messages through different online and offline platforms, with content updated as appropriate in light of the latest developments. To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into ten ethnic minority languages (including Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHP website. The Health Promotion Branch has also contacted stakeholders serving ethnic minority groups (such as non-governmental organisations and religious groups etc.) to distribute relevant health materials, so that more members of the public can access anti-mosquito information and work together to prevent the spread of CF.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public to adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. If members of the public return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. They should closely observe their personal health condition, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrangement of appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms, as it may lead to a serious and potentially fatal complication called ""Reye's syndrome"".

The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water.

衞生防護中心調查一宗新增基孔肯雅熱輸入個案及一宗可能個案（附圖）,2025-08-08 20:30,2025-08-08 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800806.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月八日）表示，中心截至今日下午五時，錄得一宗新增基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，以及一宗可能個案。中心會繼續就近日錄得的基孔肯雅熱個案加強監測。中心提醒市民，不論在本地或外遊，應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。避免蚊子叮咬和防止蚊蟲滋生是有效預防基孔肯雅熱的方法。

確診輸入個案涉及一名有長期病患的66歲女子，居於葵青區。初步調查顯示，她於七月二十四日至八月五日，獨自到廣東省佛山市探親，但未能記起曾否被蚊叮。她於八月六日起出現發燒、皮疹及關節痛，並於昨日（八月七日）到仁濟醫院急症室求診，同日入院並在無蚊環境下接受治療，現時情況穩定。她的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。

由於病人整個潛伏期在佛山市逗留，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。病人沒有其他同行人士，她的家居接觸者現時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。中心正繼續流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）正進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並會於上述病人的住所及於病發後曾到訪的地點，加強防蚊滅蚊工作，包括：

在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


另一宗可能個案涉及一名過往健康良好的22歲女子，居於東區。初步調查顯示，她於七月十六日至八月四日外遊（七月十六日至二十八日：馬達加斯加；七月二十八日至八月三日：毛里求斯；八月三日至四：馬來西亞），並於八月四日返抵香港。她報稱在馬達加斯加旅遊期間曾被蚊叮咬，自七月二十五日起在馬達加斯加出現發燒、頭痛及多處關節痛，於七月三十日起四肢出疹，她回港前已經退燒。她回港後，因關節痛於八月四日到東區尤德夫人那打素醫院急症室求診，於翌日（八月五日）入院接受治療，並於八月七日出院。

病人於八月四日採集的血液樣本對核酸檢測呈陰性反應，而於八月五日採集的血液樣本經檢驗後，今日證實對基孔肯亞熱病毒免疫球蛋白M（IgM）抗體呈陽性反應，顯示個案可能屬於已康復個案。中心認為病人在返港時已對蚊子不具傳染性。中心會安排病人於下周再抽取血液樣本作第二次抗體檢驗，如樣本中基孔肯亞熱病毒的抗體滴度比第一次的樣本高出超過四倍，可視為確診個案。

本港今年累計錄得五宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案；以及一宗可能個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為輸入個案。

根據世界衞生組織的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。截至今年七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗個案，當中約90宗為死亡個案。

衞生署已加強對不同群組有關基孔肯雅熱的宣傳教育工作。中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施，並向旅客派發宣傳單張。港口衞生科人員近日亦已提醒港鐵公司、跨境巴士和客輪公司營辦商及機場管理局等加強防控蚊患措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會為抵港人士進行體溫篩查，為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，並在有需要時轉介他們到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。長者健康外展分隊已透過超過300個為長者及照顧者提供的健康推廣活動推廣預防基孔肯雅熱的資訊。此外，長者健康服務亦安排在十八區的長者健康中心派發相關的單張，讓長者了解其症狀及加強防患基孔肯雅熱的意識。家庭健康服務亦在轄下的母嬰健康院提醒孕婦及嬰幼兒照顧者有關預防基孔肯雅熱的注意事項。學生健康服務會在轄下的學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心向學生派發宣傳單張，讓他們了解基孔肯雅熱的症狀。

健康促進處致力透過不同途徑向市民宣傳預防蚊子傳播的疾病（包括基孔肯雅熱）的健康信息，包括於全港各區設置資訊站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/other/events/476.html），透過不同的線上及線下渠道發放有關健康資訊，並適時根據最新情況更新內容。為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。健康促進處亦聯絡與少數族裔相關的持份者（如提供服務的非政府機構及宗教團體等），向他們派發相關健康資料，讓更多市民獲得防蚊的資訊，共同預防基孔肯雅熱的傳播。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況，留意發燒、關節痛或皮疹等症狀。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節，以便醫生作出臨床診斷，並按個別病人情況安排適當檢測。市民切勿自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
FEHD enhances promulgation of gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and strengthens mosquito prevention and control measures,2025-08-08 20:15,2025-08-08 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800808.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (August 8) announced that the monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in July was 8.1 per cent, at Level 2, which is lower than the 9.5 per cent in June, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in the survey areas was fairly extensive. Relevant government departments have persistently intensified mosquito prevention and elimination operations, resulting in the improvement of overall condition of mosquito infestation this month. In addition, the FEHD will strengthen the dissemination of information on gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes so that more citizens can quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation. The department will also further strengthen its mosquito control work to reduce the risk of transmission of chikungunya fever (CF).

In July, among the 64 survey areas, only the area gravidtrap index (AGI) of Ma Wan exceeded the alert level of 20 per cent, decreased from two survey areas in June. The relevant gravidtraps in the district concerned were mostly located in sports facilities and public places, and the FEHD has collaborated with other government departments and stakeholders to strengthen mosquito prevention and elimination work within 100-metre radius of the positive gravidtraps. The decreases in the monthly gravidtrap index and the number of areas with an AGI exceeding the alert level in July are attributable to the continuous and intensified mosquito prevention and elimination operations by various government departments and stakeholders, and may also have been affected by factors like weather. The monthly rainfall was 601.7 millimetres in July, showing a significant increase from the 23.73 millimetres in June.

Moreover, the monthly density index for Aedes albopictus in July was 1.2, which represented that an average of 1.2 Aedes albopictus adults were found in the Aedes-positive gravidtraps, indicating that the number of adult Aedes albopictus was not abundant in the survey areas.

The FEHD has all along been regularly announcing the gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus on its webpage. To allow more citizens to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation, the FEHD will strengthen the dissemination of information by early announcement of the latest gravidtrap index through press releases and social media platforms.

âIn addition, to further reduce the risk of transmission of CF, the FEHD will extend the intensified mosquito control work, which was originally activated when the AGI reaches 20 per cent, to cover areas with the AGI fall between 10 and 20 per cent. Specifically, the FEHD will conduct detailed risk assessments in the areas concerned to identify locations with higher mosquito infestation risks, and in collaboration with relevant departments and stakeholders, conduct intensive and targeted mosquito control work. The FEHD will also notify the nearby housing estates, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures.

Since last month, the FEHD has stepped up mosquito prevention and control measures across all districts to reduce the risk of transmission of CF and other mosquito-borne diseases. Following the recent imported CF cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations within 250-metre radius of the residence of the patients and the places they had visited during the infectious period, including removing mosquito breeding ground, applying larvicides to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and carrying out ultra-low volume fogging operations in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools, to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the AGI and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html)."
CHP investigates cluster of Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae carrier cases,2025-08-08 20:04,2025-08-08 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800807.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (August 8) investigating a cluster of Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) carrier cases involving five residents of a residential care home for the elderly (RCHE), and reminded all RCHEs to follow theGuidelines on Prevention of Communicable Diseasesin RCHE(the Guidelines) to implement measures for the detection, prevention and control of infectious diseases.

The CHP earlier received notification from the Hospital Authority (HA) that five female residents aged 68 to 93 of an RCHE in Chai Wan who attended public hospitals for underlying illnesses, had samples tested positive for CPE upon laboratory tests. All of them carry the bacteria without symptoms of infection. The CHP immediately carried out epidemiological investigations after receiving notifications from the HA. It is found that the CPE might be transmitted within the institution. The CHP is conducting screening at the RCHE concerned to identify other possible carriers.

The CHP conducted a site inspection and found that the RCHE concerned had not fully implemented the related infection control measures. The CHP advised the RCHE to implement the necessary infection control measures to further prevent transmission of the resistant bacteria within the institution, including appropriate nursing procedures, thorough environmental cleaning and disinfection, proper hand hygiene for staff and residents.

The CHP will continue to put the RCHE under medical surveillance and investigate the cluster.

Enterobacteriaceae (for example, Escherichia coli andKlebsiella) are common pathogens that can cause infections at different body sites including urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections or bacteraemia. CPE are enterobacteriaceae that produce carbapenemase- an enzyme that can deactivate carbapenems and other beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins. These bacteria are commonly resistant to multiple antibiotics, limiting therapeutic options, and may render severe clinical infections difficult to treat. The range of diseases associated with CPE varies from asymptomatic carriage to potentially life-threatening or fatal infections. The level of risk depends on which part of the body is affected by the infection and the general health of the patient.

ââProper use of antibiotics and maintaining good personal and environmental hygiene, especially hand hygiene, are important for the prevention of emergence and cross-transmission of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) like CPE. In addition, susceptible individuals such as the elderly, infants and young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immunity can lower the risk of contracting MDROs by not eating raw or undercooked foods."

Digital Policy Office holds AI+ Civil Services Technology Forum (with photos),2025-08-08 19:25,2025-08-08 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800538.htm,"  The Digital Policy Office (DPO) held the first Technology Forum in its AI+ Civil Services series at Hong Kong Cyberport today (August 8). The forum, themed ""Smart Governance Era - Digital Agents & Smart Meetings for Efficiency"", was held in hybrid mode and attracted more than 1 300 professionals from over 100 government departments as well as public and private organisations to discuss and promote the applications and innovation of AI in public services.

  In his opening address, the Commissioner for Digital Policy, Mr Tony Wong, emphasised that in response to the rapid development of AI, the Government must proactively adopt smart technologies to boost work efficiency and enhance the experience for citizens, ensuring that public services stay current and progressive. To support departments in exploring suitable AI solutions, the Smart Government Innovation Lab (Smart Lab) under the DPO earlier launched the ""AI+ Tool and Solution Catalogue"" (the Catalogue), featuring a wide range of quickly deployable AI solutions from the innovation and technology (I&T) industry that suit the needs of the Government. Mr Wong encouraged all government colleagues to explore and implement suitable solutions from the Catalogue to enhance work efficiency and optimise human resources. He also took the opportunity to invite the I&T sector to submit more high-quality solutions, fostering a shared commitment to transforming public services with AI.

  At the forum, a number of technology companies were invited to share information and exchange insights on their technologies and solutions focusing on the two main themes: ""Digital Human Customer Service"" and ""Meeting Minutes Summaries and Communication Collaboration"", providing an opportunity for government departments and the I&T sector to delve into the latest AI products and solutions, as well as to explore practical applications of AI for better public services. Among all, the Judiciary shared its experience with voice-to-text technology in the courts, and Hong Kong Cyberport introduced the local AI ecosystem development.

  The forum also featured a number of booths showcasing the latest AI technologies and products where attendees were able to visit and exchange ideas. These included the local large language model ""HKGAI V1"" developed by the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center (HKGAI), and its related applications, such as the clerical assistant ""HKPilot"", the intelligent assistant ""HKChat"", and the meeting minutes generator ""HKMeeting"". These tools have already been widely used across government departments.

  This forum was organised by the Smart Lab in collaboration with Hong Kong Cyberport, the Hong Kong Productivity Council and the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation. Since its establishment in 2019, the Smart Lab has been committed to connecting the Government with the I&T sector, actively fostering close partnerships between local start-ups, small and medium-sized enterprises, and government departments. Through regularly organising promotional activities and technology exchange workshops, the Smart Lab supports and assists government departments in accelerating the introduction of local innovative technology products and solutions, which in turn could facilitate business matching and achieve win-win outcomes.

  To further promote the wider adoption of AI across government departments, the DPO is launching a series of promotional activities under the ""AI+ Civil Services"" theme. The forum today marks the first Technology Forum of the series. In future, the DPO will continue to hold Technology Forums spotlighting relevant topics. Interested parties are most welcome to stay engaged and participate in the upcoming events.For more details, please visit the thematic website of the Smart Lab (www.smartlab.gov.hk/en/)."
衞生防護中心調查一宗產碳青霉烯酶腸道桿菌帶菌個案群組,2025-08-08 19:18,2025-08-08 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800752.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月八日）正調查一宗產碳青霉烯酶腸道桿菌帶菌個案群組，涉及一所安老院的五名院友，並提醒院舍應按照「安老院舍預防傳染病指引」執行傳染病檢測、預防和控制措施。

中心早前接獲醫院管理局（醫管局）通知，五名年齡介乎68至93歲、居於柴灣一間安老院舍的女院友，因自身疾病先後到公立醫院求診，她們的樣本經化驗後，確診帶有產碳青霉烯酶腸道桿菌。他們全部屬帶菌者，並沒有出現相關感染病徵。中心接獲醫管局通知後，隨即展開流行病學調查，發現該耐藥性細菌可能於院舍內傳播。中心正在院舍為接觸者進行篩查，以找出其他可能帶菌者。

中心人員已實地巡查涉事院舍，發現該院舍未有全面執行相關的感染控制措施。中心已建議院舍採取所需控制措施以預防耐藥性細菌在院內傳播，包括妥善護理程序、徹底清潔及消毒環境、員工和院友保持良好的手部衞生。

中心會繼續對該院舍進行醫學監察，亦會繼續調查個案群組。

腸道桿菌（例如大腸桿菌和克雷伯桿菌）是常見的病原體，能引致身體不同部位的感染，包括尿道炎、腹腔內部感染和菌血病。產碳青霉烯酶腸道桿菌產生的碳青霉烯酶酵素，可令碳青霉烯和其他β-內酰胺（如青霉素）抗生素失效。這些細菌通常對多種抗生素具有抗藥性，限制了治療的選擇，或從而導致難以治療的嚴重感染。這類細菌的帶菌者可以毫無病徵，但細菌也可引致嚴重甚至致命的感染。風險程度取決於受感染的部位和患者的健康狀況。

正確使用抗生素及注意個人和環境衞生，尤其是手部衞生，對預防多重抗藥性細菌如產碳青霉烯酶腸道桿菌的出現和交叉傳播至為重要。此外，老幼病孕等高危人士避免進食生或未煮熟食物，可減低感染多重抗藥性細菌的風險。"

​食環署加強公布白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數及強化蚊患防控措施,2025-08-08 18:30,2025-08-08 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800608.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（八月八日）公布，七月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之八點一，較六月份的百分之九點五為低，屬於二級水平，顯示監察地區內白紋伊蚊的分布情況頗為廣泛。相關政府部門持續加緊採取防蚊及滅蚊行動，令本月的整體蚊患情況比上月有所改善。此外，食環署將加強白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數的資訊發放，讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，並會進一步加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

七月份，在64個監察地區中，只有馬灣的分區誘蚊器指數高於百分之二十的警戒水平，較六月份的兩個監察地區為少。有關的誘蚊器大多位於區內的康樂設施及公眾地方，食環署已聯同其他政府部門及相關持份者，在陽性誘蚊器的100米半徑範圍加強防蚊滅蚊工作。七月份的每月誘蚊器指數及分區誘蚊器指數高於警戒水平的監察地區數目減少，是由於各政府部門及持份者持續加緊採取防蚊及滅蚊行動，亦有機會受天氣等因素影響。七月份的總雨量為601.7毫米，比六月份的237.3毫米大幅上升。

另外，七月份白紋伊蚊密度指數為一點二，表示在發現白紋伊蚊的誘蚊器中，白紋伊蚊的平均數量為一點二隻，顯示整體監察地區內的白紋伊蚊成蚊數量並不多。

現時，食環署會定期在部門網頁公布白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數。為讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，食環署將加強資訊發放，會通過新聞公布及社交媒體盡快發放最新的誘蚊器指數。

此外，為進一步降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險，食環署會將原先在分區指數達20%時啓動的強化控蚊工作，擴展至指數介乎10%至20%的區域。具體而言，食環署會在有關區域進行詳細風險評估，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，聯同各部門及持份者進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作，亦會通知附近的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

食環署自上月起已在全港各區加強防控蚊患措施，以降低基孔肯雅熱等蚊傳疾病的傳播風險。因應日前出現的基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，食環署已即時在病者的住所，及於感染期曾到訪的地點250米範圍內進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作包括清除蚊蟲滋生地、於不能清除的積水處施放殺幼蟲劑，以及於成蚊棲息處如樹木茂密、陰暗隱蔽的地點和荒廢結構進行超低微量霧化處理，以殺滅成蚊。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"
登革熱最新情況,2025-08-08 18:15,2025-08-08 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800694.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月八日）公布登革熱個案的最新數字。中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，由於在夏季期間氣溫及雨量上升，本港蚊患情況可能會加劇，加上市民在暑假會較頻繁前往登革熱流行地區，因此本地登革熱的風險正在上升。

由八月一日至昨日（八月七日），中心錄得三宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期內曾到柬埔寨、菲律賓及泰國。

截至昨日，今年錄得39宗外地傳入登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。在二○二三年，全球80多個國家及地區共呈報了逾650萬宗病例和7 300多宗登革熱相關死亡個案。世衞於二○二四年更錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點普遍流行，印度尼西亞、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年至今已分別錄得超過二萬宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過3 000宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得465宗本地感染病例，於七月二十八日至八月三日的一周內已錄得157宗，其中以廣州、雲浮、中山和佛山錄得的病例最多。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

歐家榮醫生補充：「本港經常有外地傳入的登革熱個案，每年間中亦有零星的本地登革熱個案。由於香港存在白紋伊蚊，本地市民有機會受感染。炎熱多雨的季節有利蚊子迅速繁殖。如控蚊成效不足，更有爆發登革熱的風險。因此，控蚊工作至關重要。不論在本地或外遊時，應時刻保持環境衞生、注意防蚊控蚊及採取個人保護措施。大家應緊記防止蚊子滋生及避免被蚊叮是預防登革熱的最佳方法。市民如從受登革熱影響地區回港，應在14日內繼續使用昆蟲驅避劑。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節。」

市民應繼續採取下列防蚊措施：


徹底檢查集水溝氣隔、屋頂雨水槽、明渠及排水渠，避免淤塞；
每星期至少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，以除去可能積聚的蚊卵；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，盡量避免使用墊碟；
在雨季前把凹凸不平的地面填平；
避免在叢林逗留；及
戶外活動期間，做好個人保護措施，穿着淺色長袖上衣和長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服上塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。


​含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，市民應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

Update on dengue fever,2025-08-08 18:15,2025-08-08 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800696.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (August 8) reported the latest number of dengue fever (DF) cases. The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded the public that due to the increase in temperature and rainfall in summer, mosquito infestation might be aggravated in Hong Kong. In addition, members of the public will travel to DF-endemic regions more frequently during the summer holiday. Therefore, the risk of DF in Hong Kong is increasing.

  From August 1 to yesterday (August 7), the CHP recorded three imported DF cases. The patients had travelled to Cambodia, the Philippines and Thailand during the incubation periods respectively.

As of yesterday, 39 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases and more than 7 300 dengue-related deaths were reported in over 80 countries/territories. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number.

  DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 20 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 000 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 465 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 157 cases were recorded in the week between July 28 and August 3, with the highest number of cases recorded in Guangzhou, Yunfu, Zhongshan and Foshan.

Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

  ""There have been frequent imported cases of dengue fever in Hong Kong, as well as occasional sporadic local cases every year. The presence of Aedes albopictus in Hong Kong makes our population vulnerable. Mosquitoes breed quickly during the hot and rainy summer months. There are risks of DF outbreaks if mosquito control is inadequate. Hence, mosquito control is of paramount importance. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. The public is reminded that eliminating mosquito breeding sites and avoiding mosquito bites are key to preventing DF. Those returning from areas affected by DF should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. If feeling unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to a doctor,"" Dr Au added.

  Members of the public are also reminded to take heed of the following advice on mosquito control:


Thoroughly check all gully traps, roof gutters, surface channels and drains to prevent blockage;
Scrub and clean drains and surface channels with an alkaline detergent compound at least once a week to remove any deposited mosquito eggs;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxes, in covered litter containers;
Completely change the water of flowers and plants at least once a week. The use of saucers should be avoided if possible;
Level irregular ground surfaces before the rainy season;
Avoid staying in shrubby areas; and
Take personal protective measures such as wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothes and trousers, and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or uncovered areas of the body when doing outdoor activities.


âDEET-containing insect repellents are effective and the public should take heed of the tips below:


Read the label instructions carefully first;
Apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
Apply on exposed skin and clothing;
Use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
Apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
In addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535, picaridin etc. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the DF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook PageandYouTube Channel."

SCS encourages non-ethnic Chinese interns to better equip themselves,2025-08-08 18:05,2025-08-08 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800486.htm,"  The Secretary for the Civil Service, Mrs Ingrid Yeung, attended a sharing session on the Internship Programme for Non-ethnic Chinese (NEC) Students today (August 8). At the gathering, she listened to the students share their internship experiences and encouraged them to better equip themselves in preparation for their future career planning.

  Mrs Yeung was pleased to learn that the students had gained a deeper understanding of the work of the civil service through their internships in different bureaux and departments. She said, ""The Government attaches great importance to attracting talent from different backgrounds to join the civil service and building a diversified pool of talent to enhance the quality and efficiency of public service. In the recruitment process, all candidates are assessed on the basis of their ability, performance and character. Race is not, and has never been, a relevant consideration.""

  To encourage NEC interns to join the Government, the Civil Service Bureau (CSB) invited two NEC civil servants, Administrative Officer Mr Gurung Marco Ben and Executive Officer Ms Kaur Gurinder Deep, Diya, to share their experiences and preparation for applying for civil service jobs, as well as their daily work experiences. Born and raised in Hong Kong, both of them possess biliterate and trilingual abilities and were appointed as civil servants through the open recruitment process.

  Mrs Yeung added, ""We are glad to see more and more NECs joining the civil service and contributing to the development and prosperity of Hong Kong. We look forward to more promising young people joining the civil service and encourage them to equip themselves earlier to take on challenges.""

  The CSB has been organising the Internship Programme for NEC Students since 2019 with a view to helping young NECs accumulate work experience and strengthen their competitiveness in seeking jobs and deepening their understanding of the operation of the Government through the internship experience. Since the launch of the internship programme, more than 220 NEC students have participated in the programme, including the 44 students who joined this year, which marks a record high. The students were arranged to undertake internships in various bureaux and departments for about eight weeks and were provided with online basic workplace Chinese language self-learning resources to strengthen their Chinese learning.

  Mr Sheik Mahmood Afif, a university student studying computer engineering, participated in the internship programme this year. He assisted with the daily operations of the Smart Government Innovation Lab at the Digital Policy Office, including developing AI analysis tools. He believes the internship is highly relevant to his studies, allowing him to apply his knowledge to his work and strengthening his interest in pursuing a career in a technology-related field.

  Another intern, Miss Lama Sujata, was posted to the Festivals Office of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department to provide back-end support for programme preparation. She took part in designing promotional materials, hospitality for artists, liaising with venue management, and more. She said that the internship experience has enabled her to familiarise herself with the application of design and image processing software and enhanced her knowledge of event planning, which will greatly help her future career.

  Miss Narag Kezra Leigh, a social work student, has just finished her internship at the Youth Employment Division of the Labour Department, where she assisted in promoting the Youth Employment Start, the department's youth employment resource centre. She provided support to social workers in giving talks at secondary schools and organising activities at the centre. The internship experience allowed her to better understand the employment services provided by the Government to the public, in particular for young people, and improved her interpersonal skills through interactions with service users."

In 2023, the country designated August 15 every year as NED, with a view to promoting society's awareness of ecological civilisation and environmental protection, and implementing the important concept of ""lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets"".

  The Hong Kong Wetland Park will offer free admission and guided tours for the public on August 15. Members of the public can also enjoy a special discount of 18.5 per cent off for gift redemptions or e-coupons (excluding supermarket vouchers and dining vouchers) on the GREEN$ Mobile App, as well as at GREEN@COMMUNITY Recycling Stations and Recycling Stores (excluding Recycling Spots) under the Environmental Protection Department on the same day.

  The Countryside Conservation Office (CCO) under the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) will hold a thematic exhibition for NED at the atrium of Citywalk 2 in Tsuen Wan from September 9 to 17. The nine-day event will feature various displays and interactive games to enhance the knowledge and awareness of the public regarding nature conservation and environmental protection in Hong Kong.

  Furthermore, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) will organise four guided eco-tours in Shing Mun Country Park and the Lions Nature Education Centre, and share tips on observing fireflies with the public at night in Tai Po Kau Nature Reserve, with a view to enabling the public to explore local wildlife and appreciate the beauty and uniqueness of Hong Kong's natural ecology. Over 30 non-governmental organisations will provide a series of special activities and offers, including free admission to facilities, free guided eco-tours, night safaris, workshops and seminars.

  A spokesman for the EEB said, ""The HKSAR Government appeals to the public for active participation in the activities of NED. We hope that these activities will enhance the local community's consciousness of the need for thought and action to conserve our nature and protect the environment, and jointly contribute to the building of a beautiful China and a beautiful Hong Kong. We are grateful to all relevant organisations for their participation in providing special activities and offers.""
