再次錄得食物中毒個案群組　衞生防護中心提醒市民現時不要進食生蠔及注意食物安全,2026-02-12 21:30,2026-02-12 21:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200764.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心今日（二月十二日）正調查兩宗有流行病學關連的食物中毒個案群組，共涉及七人。衞生防護中心呼籲市民保持個人、食物及環境衞生，預防經由食物傳播的疾病。

新增食物中毒個案群組
——————————

受影響的一男六女年齡介乎24歲至45歲，他們先後於一月三十一日及二月一日在九龍尖沙咀彌敦道100號THE ONE商場四樓L407鋪一間名為O DELICE!的食肆晚膳後，約28至36小時先後出現腹瀉、腹痛、嘔吐和發燒等病徵。

其中三名受影響人士已求醫，無須入院。全部受影響人士現時情況穩定。

初步調查顯示，受影響人士於上述食肆進食的共同食物為生蠔。食物環境衞生署人員（包括食物安全中心和環境衞生部人員）在二月五日接獲衞生防護中心通知第一宗個案後，已即時到涉事餐廳及生蠔供應商調查。調查發現此群組生蠔供應商為傑頓國際食品及88投資控股有限公司。食物安全中心在二月六日已經即時指示供應商傑頓國際食品及88投資控股有限公司暫停出售及供應生蠔，並在當日發出有關跟進工作的新聞稿，指示業界如持有該公司供應的生蠔，應立即停售。所有新呈報的個案，均在食物安全中心採取防控措施前進食有關生蠔。

衞生防護中心及食物安全中心的調查仍然繼續。

諾如病毒食物中毒個案持續增加
——————————————

衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「過去數周錄得的食物中毒個案持續增加，由去年十二月底每周錄得平均一宗個案，上升至一月每周平均四宗。一月十八日至二月十二日，中心已錄得45宗食物中毒個案，共影響53男和82女，年齡介乎15至75歲。其中，87%（39宗）與諾如病毒相關，涉及113人。流行病學調查發現上述與諾如病毒相關的食物中毒個案的受影響人士全部在潛伏期內曾食用生蠔。」

徐樂堅醫生解釋：「由於蠔隻以過濾大量海水的方式進食，如果養蠔或採蠔的水域水質帶有病原體，這些物質便會在蠔的體內積聚。生或未徹底煮熟的蠔是高風險食物，進食受污染及未經煮熟的蠔，可能感染經由食物傳染的疾病，例如諾如病毒、甲型肝炎病毒或其他細菌。農曆新年期間，市民很多時會與親友聚餐，我特別提醒市民，無論是在家或光顧食肆，應進食徹底煮熟食物，特別是貝類，以避免感染腸道疾病。酒精飲料、檸檬汁或芥末亦不能殺死諾如病毒。以火鍋或炭燒方式進食蠔，亦要確保完全熟透，方可有效降低感染諾如病毒的風險。鑑於近期諾如病毒的活躍程度上升，流行病學數據亦顯示大部分食物中毒是由進食生蠔引致的，而食物環境衞生署食物安全中心正在調查生蠔來源，因此建議市民不應冒險進食未經煮熟的蠔。」

​徐樂堅醫生續說：「值得留意的是，諾如病毒具高度傳染性，因進食受污染食物而感染諾如病毒的人士，可能會透過人與人接觸或受嘔吐物污染的環境，將病毒傳播給其他人。除了食物中毒，諾如病毒亦是引致急性腸胃炎的主要原因之一。我們的監測指標顯示本地急性腸胃炎的活躍程度自一月初起持續上升，包括院舍及學校的急性腸胃炎爆發個案，實驗室的檢測顯示超過七成半是諾如病毒引致。此外，其他香港人的旅遊熱點，包括日本及韓國，近日的諾如病毒活躍程度亦持續上升，韓國的監測數據顯示諾如病毒活躍程度達近五年同期的新高。市民外遊時要提高警覺，注意個人、環境及食物衞生，以減低受感染的風險。」

要預防急性腸胃炎及諾如病毒感染，必須經常保持雙手清潔。由於酒精未能有效殺死諾如病毒，酒精搓手液不能代替使用梘液和清水潔手，尤其在處理食物或進食前及如廁後。洗手時應以梘液和清水清潔雙手，搓手最少20秒，用水過清並用抹手紙或乾手機弄乾。

CHP reminds public not to consume raw oysters and observe food safety for the time being as two more food poisoning clusters reported,2026-02-12 21:30,2026-02-12 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200782.htm,"​The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (February 12) investigating two epidemiologically linked food poisoning clusters affecting a total of seven persons. The CHP reminded the public to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent foodborne diseases.

New food poisoning clusters
------------------------------------

 The clusters involve one male and six females aged between 24 and 45. They developed diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting and fever about 28 to 36 hours after having dinner at O DELICE! located at Shop L407 on Level 4, THE ONE, 100 Nathan Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, on January 31 and February 1 respectively.

 Three of the affected persons sought medical advice but did not require hospitalisation. All of the affected individuals are currently in stable condition.

 A preliminary investigation revealed that the food item that the affected individuals had in common at the aforementioned restaurant was raw oyster. Upon receiving the CHP's notification of the first cluster on February 5, officers of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)(including personnel of the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch) immediately conducted an investigation in the concerned restaurant and the raw oyster supplier. Investigations revealed that the raw oyster supplier of these clusters is Jeton International Food and 88 Investment Holdings Limited. The CFS immediately instructed Jeton International Food and 88 Investment Holdings Limited to suspend the sale and supply of raw oysters on February 6, and issued a press release on the follow-up actions on the same day, instructing the trade to stop selling raw oysters supplied by the company concerned immediately if they possess them. All of the newly reported cases consumed raw oysters concerned before preventive and control measures instituted by the CFS.

 The investigation of the CHP and the CFS is ongoing.

Continuously rising of norovirus-related food poisoning cases
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

""The number of food poisoning cases recorded over the past few weeks has continued to rise, increasing from an average of one case per week in late December last year to an average of four cases per week in January. From January 18 to February 12, the CHP recorded 45 food poisoning cases, affecting 53 males and 82 females aged between 15 and 75. Nearly 87 per cent (39 cases) were associated with norovirus, affecting 113 persons. Epidemiological investigations showed that all the individuals affected by the abovementioned food poisoning cases related to norovirus had consumed raw oysters during the incubation period,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""As oysters feed by filtering a large volume of seawater, pathogens can accumulate in them if they are grown in or harvested from contaminated water. Raw or undercooked oysters are considered a high-risk food. Persons who consume contaminated or undercooked oysters may contract food-borne diseases, such as norovirus, hepatitis A virus or other bacteria. During the Lunar New Year, people usually gather for meals with relatives and friends. I particularly remind the public that only thoroughly cooked food, especially shellfish, should be consumed, whether dining at home or in restaurants, to avoid contracting enteric diseases. Norovirus cannot be killed by alcoholic beverages, lemon juice or wasabi. When cooking oysters in a hot pot or on the grill, ensure that they are thoroughly cooked to effectively minimise the risk of norovirus infection. Given the recent increase in norovirus activity with epidemiological data indicating that most food poisoning cases are related to raw oyster consumption, and as the CFS of the FEHD is investigating the source of raw oysters, members of the public should not take the risk of consuming undercooked oysters,"" Dr Tsui explained.

""It is worth noting that norovirus is highly contagious. Individuals infected with norovirus through contaminated food can spread the virus to others through person-to-person contact or environment contaminated by vomitus. In addition to causing food poisoning, norovirus is also one of the primary causes of acute gastroenteritis (AGE). According to our surveillance data, the AGE activity level in Hong Kong has been rising since early January, including AGE outbreaks in institutions and schools. Laboratory testing indicated that over 75 per cent of the AGE outbreaks were caused by norovirus. Additionally, norovirus activity has increased in other popular travel destinations for Hong Kong citizens, including Japan and Korea. Surveillance data from Korea showed that the norovirus activity has reached its highest level in nearly five years for this time of year. Members of the public should remain vigilant and maintain good personal, environmental and food hygiene when travelling abroad and pay attention to minimise the risk of infection,"" Dr Tsui added.

To prevent AGE and norovirus infection, members of the public should perform hand hygiene frequently. Since alcohol is not effective in killing norovirus, alcohol-based handrubs are not a substitute for handwashing with soap and water, especially before handling food or eating, and after using the toilet. Wash hands with liquid soap and water, and rub for at least 20 seconds. Then rinse with water and dry with a disposable paper towel or hand dryer.

Members of the public may visit the CHP's dedicated webpages for the prevention ofNorovirus InfectionandViral Gastroenteritis."
內聯外通促發展　識變創新迎未來（附圖）,2026-02-12 21:09,2026-02-12 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200615.htm,"香港海關關長陳子達今日（二月十二日）在香港海關總部大樓主持部門二○二五年工作回顧記者會，總結過往一年香港海關的工作成果。過去一年，部門繼續全力守好國家南大門，全方位堵截各類型走私活動，致力打撃私煙及毒品活動，防止違禁品以及受管制物品進出香港，同時亦與內地以及不同國家及地區協同聯動，推展各項便商利貿以及通關便利措施，令香港更好發揮內聯外通的角色，助力國家的高水平對外開放及經濟高質量發展。

總體執法情況
－－－－－－

海關於二○二五年的執法案件有38 869宗，較二○二四年上升24%。執法案件中，約75%涉及私煙活動，其次為毒品案件，以及侵犯知識產權案件。

私煙
－－

打擊私煙案件方面，二○二五年共有29 037宗案件，拘捕28 580人，較二○二四年分別上升36%及39%；檢獲私煙6.04億支，與二○二四年相若。

去年案件數目及拘捕人數大幅上升的其中一個主要原因是旅檢通道截獲「入境人士攜帶超額免稅香煙」的案件數字大幅增加，此類案件「以罰款代替訴訟」處理的入境旅客有約27 000人，較前年上升41%。海關亦發現有犯罪集團聘用旅客以螞蟻搬家的方式走私煙草產品到港。

此外，海關去年共偵破2 600宗另類吸煙產品案件，拘捕共2 559人，檢獲約935萬件相關產品，包括電子煙和加熱煙。

海關去年亦加強從源頭堵截私煙，透過與內地及海外多個海關組織進行情報交流及採取聯合行動，成功破獲多宗跨境走私香煙案件。 另外，部門亦透過國際情報交流，成功協助外地執法機構於歐洲及亞太地區破獲52宗走私香煙案件，檢獲約2.4億支私煙。

立法會去年九月十一日通過《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》，提升未完稅煙草相關罪行的罰則，以及引入完稅標籤制度。海關已透過不同渠道提高公眾和旅客對私煙新罰則的認知，亦於去年十月至今年一月期間推行完稅標籤制度先導計劃模擬實際操作的運作流程及相關技術。完稅標籤制度暫定於今年第四季推行首階段措施，並於明年第二季全面實施，海關期望措施有助市民分辨已完稅及未完稅香煙，有效打撃「白牌煙」。

非法汽油
－－－－

海關因應非法汽油活動增加，相應加強執法力度，去年共偵破39宗非法油站案件，檢獲非法汽油共96 211公升，案件宗數較二○二四年上升1.6倍。此外，海關去年亦破獲17宗走私非法燃油案件，檢獲非法燃油22 776公升，比較二○二四年分別上升約九成及接近3倍，當中包括以海路及陸路方式走私非法燃油。

海關會密切監察情況，派員加強巡查，適時調整執法策略。海關亦會對加注非法汽油的汽車採取嚴厲執法，會檢取涉案車輛並向法庭申請充公。

毒品
－－

海關於二○二五年偵破961宗毒品案件，較前年減少29%，檢獲毒品約7.5噸，則較前年上升19%。

年內檢獲最主要的三類毒品依次為大麻2 977公斤，按年上升4%；甲基安非他命（冰毒）1 664.4公斤，按年上升50%；氯胺酮1 486.1公斤，按年上升24%。此外，去年共偵破43宗依托咪酯案件，檢獲約25.2公斤依托咪酯及4 387粒含有依托咪酯的煙彈，並拘捕43人。

海關發現販毒集團除了繼續利用大型貨物、空運郵遞及快遞販運毒品外，亦有聘用航空旅客協助販毒的趨勢，去年經該渠道偵破的毒品案件及檢獲的毒品達192宗及2 462.7公斤，較二○二四年大幅上升約71%及1.5倍，而檢獲的毒品數量更佔部門整體檢獲毒品近三分之一。

走私
－－

海關去年偵破286宗走私案件，較前年上升22%，檢獲總值42.17億元貨物，較前年下跌2%。

走私集團主要利用海路進行走私活動，除了利用躉船、快艇、漁船和內河船走私大量貨物運到鄰近的內地城市及澳門，亦會選擇以遠洋船進行走私，以及採取更迂迴的路線，先將貨物運往外地，再轉口往內地，以逃避香港海關人員的偵查。去年，海關共偵破33宗利用遠洋船及9宗利用內河船走私的案件。

此外，海關去年亦偵破多宗走私貴金屬的案件，共檢獲393公斤黃金，估計市值約3.2億元。而去年偵破走私瀕危物種案件則有573宗，檢獲物品重量約84.5噸及拘捕374人，數字均較前年有所上升。

洗黑錢
－－－

海關於去年偵破12宗洗黑錢案件，拘捕24人，涉案金額約128億元。案件數目較二○二四年上升9%，而被捕人士數目及涉案金額則分別減少27%及33%。

知識產權
－－－－

去年海關共偵破723宗侵犯知識產權案件，檢獲約97萬件侵權物品，總值約4.2億元，檢獲物品總值較二○二四年上升35%。

去年三月啟德體育園正式開幕，吸引多項大型活動及國際賽事落戶香港，為防止不法份子利用盛事熱潮售賣侵權物品，海關於節日前夕及大型國際盛事期間全力執法，以守護香港正貨之都的美譽。

消費者權益
－－－－－

海關去年接獲10 775宗懷疑違反《商品說明條例》的投訴，較二○二四年下降13%，當中過半為涉及服務的投訴。

去年海關共收到3 404宗與商戶結業相關舉報，當中絕大部份涉及實體商戶結業，90宗則涉及網上商戶結業。

海關亦致力透過多個渠道向訪港旅客宣傳消費權益，除透過社交媒體宣傳外，亦於港深跨境巴士播放消費權益相關的短片。此外，海關去年亦在多項大型展覽中設立流動宣傳攤位，提醒消費者進行預繳式消費前要仔細考慮，並留意商戶結業所帶來的風險及可能造成的損失，亦到訪不同長者中心進行宣傳教育工作提高長者的消費權益意識。

通關便利便商利貿
－－－－－－－－－

海關在促進通關便利、便商利貿方面持續發展，並推行各項相關措施。

通關情況

去年各口岸的出入境人次為約3.3億，較前年增加12%。出入境私家車及貨車車輛架次分別約為1 190萬及480萬，較前年增加24%及6%。海關亦於重要節慶或假日前夕，調配相應人手確保口岸運作暢順。

便商利貿措施

（一）「跨境一鎖計劃」去年七月已推展至福州關區，令計劃下設立的清關點增至99個，為業界提供過千條跨境路線作選擇，打造粵港物流綠色通道。

（二）商務及經濟發展局與國家海關總署去年五月簽署《「單一窗口」的合作安排》，進一步加強內地與香港在「單一窗口」方面的合作和交流，推進兩地系統對接。「單一窗口」第三階段服務將分批推出，首批服務預計今年年中推行，取代現有「道路貨物資料系統」。

（三）香港海關一月十二日將自由貿易協定中轉貨物便利計劃（「中轉易」）擴展至由內地經香港中轉往秘魯的貨物，進一步協助企業開拓新市場，鞏固香港的領先物流樞紐地位。現時「中轉易」的服務範圍涵蓋七十一個經濟體經香港中轉至內地的貨物，以及由內地經香港中轉往中國台灣、韓國、新加坡、越南、尼加拉瓜、緬甸、澳洲和秘魯的貨物。

加強內地和國際合作
－－－－－－－－－

香港海關去年繼續深化內聯外通，積極推動區域以至國際的交流和合作。

香港海關去年積極拓展「香港認可經濟營運商計劃」（AEO）互認安排的全球網絡，並取得標誌性進展，包括與沙特阿拉伯海關及秘魯海關簽訂AEO互認安排，而與秘魯海關簽訂的互認安排更是香港海關首份與南美地區當局簽署的互認安排。現時，香港海關已與18個經濟體簽訂互認安排，未來亦會與阿拉伯聯合酋長國、卡塔爾、哈薩克斯坦、智利、菲律賓及其他「一帶一路」沿線國家商討有關工作。

香港海關自二○二四年七月起，代表中國香港出任二○二四至二○二六年世界海關組織亞太區副主席一職，並籌辦了一系列全球性或地區性國際會議、聯合執法行動、研討會和工作坊等，包括第26屆世界海關組織亞太區首腦會議和聯同東南亞國家聯盟秘書處合辦的電子商貿優化流程與典範實務會議。

香港海關就任世界海關組織亞太區副主席後亦積極推動區內的科技應用，領導設計和開發一項應用區塊鏈技術的電子文件驗證平台「ValidAP」，助力香港以及亞太區域的物流及經貿發展，以及加強數字化和無紙化。

香港海關作為世界海關組織亞太區副主席任期將於今年六月屆滿，目前正積極考慮競逐連任，希望可以持續推動地區發展議程、協調地區事務、引領成員應對各種挑戰。

新制服
－－－

為提升職業安全、工作效率和部門專業形象，香港海關設計了全新制服。新制服的設計充分考慮前線人員意見，滿足舒適度、功能性和美感的需求。部門去年六月起陸續為4 500名軍裝人員更換全新制服，並將於今年第二季全面更換，期望為部門帶來煥然一新的形象和提升同事工作效率。

以新思維解決舊問題
－－－－－－－－－

去年，香港海關聯同廣州海關、深圳海關以及相關部門試行「穗港汽車出口快線」和「深港汽車快通計劃」，為汽車業界拆牆鬆綁，優化電動私家車由內地出口至香港的通關、登記及領牌流程，大大減省汽車進口香港後等待審批的時間和存倉成本，計劃大受好評。

另外，在香港海關聯同相關部門及內地當局的積極推展下，空陸鮮活產品專屬快線（鮮活快線）於去年正式全面開通。憑藉港珠澳大橋聯通三地及毗鄰香港國際機場的優勢，以及依靠香港國際機場完善的貨物溫控設施，進一步推動「空陸貨物多式聯運」，構建港珠澳大橋成為鮮活食品的綠色通道，促進外地與大灣區鮮活食品的貿易，實現「用好管好港珠澳大橋」。

此外，隨着海關近年毒品檢獲量大幅上升，積存待銷毀的毒品、行政和倉存成本亦與日俱增。為提升工作效率及節省公共資源，海關主動建議改革銷毀流程，在相關部門支持下，迅速修訂相關規例，並由去年四月起開始自行銷毀毒品，大幅縮短毒品銷毀時間和節省政府倉存開支。

結語
－－

陳子達表示，部門會在推動便利商貿和通關措施，以至日常工作上，以識變創新和不畏難的態度應對各項挑戰，致力做到犯其至難而圖其至遠。"
Forge advancement through connectivity and visionary innovation,2026-02-12 21:09,2026-02-12 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200687.htm,"The Commissioner of Customs and Excise, Mr Chan Tsz-tat, chaired Customs' 2025 year-end press conference held at the Customs Headquarters Building today (February 12) to review the department's efforts in the past year. The department continued to spare no efforts in guarding the southern gateway to the country, intercepting various smuggling activities on all fronts, combatting illicit cigarette and dangerous drug activities, and preventing prohibited/controlled items into or out of Hong Kong, as well as strengthening collaboration with the Chinese Mainland, different countries and regions in implementing various measures to facilitate trade and clearance. All these help Hong Kong proactively capitalise on its role as a bridge linking the country and the world, hence contributing to the high-level opening up and high-quality economic development of the country.

Overall enforcement situation
---------------------------------

In 2025, Customs detected a total of 38 869 cases, an increase of 24 per cent from the 2024 figure. About 75 per cent of the cases are related to illicit cigarettes, followed by cases related to dangerous drugs and intellectual property rights infringement.

Illicit cigarettes
--------------------

On the anti-illicit cigarette operation front, 29 037 cases were detected and 28 580 persons were arrested in 2025, increases of 36 per cent and 39 per cent from 2024 respectively, with 604 million cigarettes seized, which was about the same as the 2024 figure.

The significant increase in the number of cases and arrestees mainly stemmed from a huge surge in cases of inbound persons bringing in cigarettes exceeding the duty-free concessions by imposing a penalty on offences compoundable at passenger clearance channels, in which about 27 000 inbound persons were involved. This showed an increase of 41 per cent from 2024. Customs also noticed that syndicates exploited travelers and adopted an ""ant-moving-home"" approach to smuggle tobacco products into Hong Kong.

In addition, 2 600 cases involving alternative smoking products, with seizures of about 9.35 million pieces of relevant products, including electronic cigarettes and heat-not burn products, were detected last year. 2 559 persons were also arrested.

Customs also stepped up enforcement actions to combat illicit cigarettes at source last year and detected numerous cross-boundary cigarette smuggling cases through collaboration with customs administrations of the Chinese Mainland and overseas via intelligence exchanges and joint operations. Moreover, through international intelligence exchanges, the department also assisted overseas law enforcement agencies in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region in detecting 52 cigarette smuggling cases with 240 million illicit cigarettes seized.

The Tobacco Control Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2025 (Amendment Bill) was passed by the Legislative Council on September 11, 2025, to raise the maximum penalty for offences relating to duty-not-paid tobacco and to implement a duty stamp system. While efforts have been made through various channels to raise the awareness of members of the public and passengers on the increased penalties relating to illicit cigarettes, Customs also launched the Pilot Run of the Duty Stamp System between last October and this January to simulate the workflow and related technology in practical operations. Customs plans to implement the first phase of the Duty Stamp System in the fourth quarter this year, with full implementation in the second quarter of 2027, thus achieving the goal of enabling members of the public to distinguish duty-paid cigarettes from duty-not-paid ones, and to combat ""cheap whites"" effectively.

Illicit fuel
------------

In view of the increasing trend of illicit fuel activities, Customs has strengthened enforcement actions and detected 39 cases related to illegal fueling stations, which was 1.6-fold higher than that of 2024, and seized 96 211 litres of illicit motor spirit. Customs also detected 17 illicit fuel cases and seized 22 776 litres of illicit fuel, representing an increase of about 90 per cent and close to three-fold from 2024 respectively. The cases included smuggling illicit fuels by means of sea and land.

Customs will closely monitor the situation, step up inspections and adjust its enforcement strategies and measures in a timely manner. The department will also carry out stringent enforcement action against vehicles patronising illegal fueling stations, and vehicles involved will be detained and may be liable to confiscation.

Dangerous drugs
-----------------------

In 2025, 961 drug cases were detected, which was a decrease of 29 per cent from 2024. A total seizure of about 7.5 tonnes of drugs was made, representing an increase of 19 per cent from 2024.

The three major drug seizures in order of quantity were cannabis (2 977 kilograms, a 4 per cent increase), methamphetamine (1 664.4kg, a 50 per cent increase) and ketamine (1 486.1kg, a 24 per cent increase) compared to the figure for 2024. Meanwhile, 43 cases involving etomidate were detected last year, with about 25.2kg of etomidate and 4 387 capsules containing etomidate seized, and 43 persons arrested.

Apart from using large cargos, airmail and express cargo, Customs noticed a trend that drug syndicates also traffic drugs by exploiting inbound air passengers, and the number of such cases and the seizure quantity noticeably increased by about 71 per cent and 1.5-fold from 2024 to 192 cases and 2 462.7kg of drugs seized last year. The drugs seized by such means even accounted for close to one-third of the department's total drug seizures.

Smuggling
------------

A total of 286 smuggling cases were detected last year, an increase of 22 per cent from 2024, with a seizure value of $4.217 billion in total made, representing a drop of 2 per cent from 2024.

Smuggling syndicates still mainly conduct smuggling activities by sea, making use of barges, speedboats, fishing vessels and river trade vessels to smuggle large amounts of goods to nearby Mainland cities and Macao. Hong Kong Customs also found criminals using ocean-going vessels and adopting more circuitous routes by shipping goods overseas and then re-exporting them to the Chinese Mainland to evade the department's detection. Last year, 33 and nine smuggling cases involving ocean-going vessels and river trade vessels were detected respectively.

Customs also detected various smuggling cases involving precious metals last year, in which a total of 393kg of gold with an estimated market value of about $320 million were seized. Moreover, 573 endangered species smuggling cases were detected last year, with about 84.5 tonnes of seizures and 374 arrests made. Such figures showed an increase from 2024.

Money laundering
--------------------

Customs last year detected 12 money laundering cases with 24 persons arrested and $12.8 billion involved. The number of cases showed an increase of 9 per cent while the number of arrests and amount involved dropped 27 per cent and 33 per cent respectively.

Intellectual property rights
------------------------------

Customs detected 723 intellectual property rights infringement cases last year with about 970,000 infringing goods seized. The seizure value of infringing items increased 35 per cent to around $420 million as compared to the figure for 2024.

With the opening of the Kai Tak Sports Park in March last year, numerous major events and international games were held in Hong Kong. To prevent lawbreakers from taking advantage on the fervour of major events to sell infringing goods, Customs officers stringently enforced the law before festivals and during international mega events to safeguard Hong Kong's reputation as a shopping paradise for genuine goods.

Consumer protection
------------------------

Customs last year received 10 775 complaints regarding suspected cases of violating the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, a drop of 13 per cent from 2024. Among them, more than half of the complaints were related to services.

Last year, Customs received 3 404 complaints related to the winding up of businesses, the majority of which involved closure of physical shops while 90 cases were related to closure of online shops.

Customs is also committed to conducting promotion of consumer rights to visitors through multiple channels, apart from promotion via social media platforms, promotional videos on consumer rights were also broadcast on cross-boundary coaches between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. Mobile promotional booths were set up at various exhibitions to remind consumers to give prudent consideration before making decisions for consumption involving prepayments, and the risks and potential loss caused by a sudden business closure. Customs officers also visited elderly centres to conduct promotion and education work to raise the awareness of consumer rights among the elderly.

Clearance and trade facilitation
-----------------------------------

Customs has continued to facilitate clearance and trade, and implement various related measures.

Clearance

​Boundary control points recorded about 330 million in passenger traffic, representing an increase of 12 per cent from 2024. There were 11.9 million and 4.8 million trips of inbound and outbound private cars and goods vehicles respectively last year, showing an increase of 24 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. Customs also flexibly deployed manpower to ensure smooth operations of boundary control points before major festivals and holidays.

Trade facilitative measures

(1) The Single E-lock Scheme was extended to the Fuzhou Customs District in July last year, increasing the number of Customs clearance points under the scheme to 99. Thousands of cross boundary routes were provided to the industry and a ""green lane"" for facilitating logistics flows between Hong Kong and Guangdong was built.

(2) The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China signed the Cooperation Arrangement on Single Window in May last year to further strengthen collaboration and exchanges on the Single Window between Hong Kong and the Mainland, as well as to enhance system connectivity between the two places. Phase 3 services of the Single Window will be implemented in batches, and the first batch of the service will be rolled out in the middle of this year and will replace the existing Road Cargo System.

(3) On January 12, Hong Kong Customs extended the Free Trade Agreement Transhipment Facilitation Scheme (FTA Scheme) to cover transshipment cargoes from the Mainland to Peru via Hong Kong, further helping enterprises to extend new markets and consolidate Hong Kong's leading position as a logistics hub. The scope of service of the FTA Scheme now covers cargoes of 71 economies to be transshipped via Hong Kong to the Mainland, and the Mainland transshipment cargoes heading for China's Taiwan region, Korea, Singapore, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Myanmar, Australia and Peru via Hong Kong.

Strengthen Mainland and international co-operation
----------------------------------------------------------

Hong Kong Customs last year continued to reinforce connections with both the Mainland and the world, promoting regional and global exchanges and co-operation.

Customs last year actively expanded the global network of the Hong Kong Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) and achieved significant progress, including the signing of AEO MRAs with Saudi Arabia Customs and Peruvian Customs. The one signed with Peruvian Customs marked the first MRA signed between Hong Kong Customs and South American authorities. As of now, there are a total of 18 MRAs ratified between Hong Kong Customs and other economies. Discussions about MRAs with the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kazakhstan, Chile, Philippines and other countries along the Belt and Road Initiative is ongoing.

Since assuming the office of the Vice-Chairperson for the Asia/Pacific (A/P) region of the World Customs Organization (WCO) in July last year, Hong Kong Customs has hosted a series of global and regional international conferences, joint enforcement operations, forums and workshops, including the 26th WCO A/P Regional Heads of Customs Administrations Conference and the Conference on Simplification of Procedures and Best Practices for E-commerce jointly held with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Secretariat.

Hong Kong Customs also actively promoted the application of technology in the region, leading the design and development of ""ValidAP"", a blockchain-based validation platform for digital documents, with an aim to facilitate Hong Kong and A/P regions' logistics and commercial development, as well as enhance digitalisation and a paperless process.

Hong King Customs' tenure as the Vice-Chairperson for the A/P region of the WCO will end in June this year. The department is actively considering running for re-election, hoping to continue to advance the regional development agenda, co-ordinate regional affairs, and lead the members in addressing various challenges.

New uniform
-----------------

To enhance occupational safety, work efficiency, and the department's professional image, Hong Kong Customs has designed a new uniform. The new design fully considers feedback from frontline staff, meeting their needs for comfort, functionality, and aesthetics. Customs has been replacing the uniforms of 4 500 frontline officers with the new ones starting last June, and the full implementation will be completed in the second quarter of this year, hoping to give the department a refreshed image while improving the work efficiency of staff.

New mindset
------------------

Last year, trial runs of the Guangzhou-Hong Kong Motor Vehicle Export Facilitation Scheme and the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Motor Vehicle Export Facilitation Scheme were conducted among Hong Kong Customs, the Guangzhou Customs District, the Shenzhen Customs District and other relevant departments, removing barriers and restrictions for the motor vehicle industry by improving the procedures of clearance, registration and licensing of electric private cars exported from the Mainland to Hong Kong. These helped greatly reduce the time for scrutiny and storage costs after the vehicles were imported into Hong Kong. The schemes were well received by the industry.

In addition, Hong Kong Customs, relevant departments and mainland authorities have been actively taking forward the Air-Land Fresh Lane and the scheme was fully launched last year. The scheme utilises the strengths of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) and Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA), and the temperature-controlled facilities for cargo at HKIA and further promotes the Intermodal Transhipment of Air and Land Cargo, thus making the HZMB a ""green channel"" for fresh food. It is hoped to take forward the fresh food trade between overseas and the Greater Bay Area and make good use of the HZMB.

​With the significant increase in drug seizures by Customs in recent years, the drugs pending for disposal and the administrative and storage costs have also risen accordingly. To improve efficiency and save public resources, Customs, with the support of relevant departments and swift amendment of relevant regulation, has been disposing drug seizures since April last year. Such measures significantly reduce the drug disposal time and storage cost of the Government.

Conclusion
--------------
Mr Chan said that the department will embrace changes and be bold in promoting trade and clearance measures, as well as in executing daily tasks, so as to pursue the most ambitious goals."

Tokyo ETO holds reception in Seoul to strengthen economic and people-to-people ties (with photos),2026-02-12 20:20,2026-02-12 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021100610.htm,"  The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Tokyo (Tokyo ETO) held a reception in Seoul, Korea, today (February 12) to promote Hong Kong's latest developments and to strengthen bilateral economic ties and people-to-people exchanges. More than 150 guests attended the event, including representatives from the local government, business, academia, media and cultural sectors.

 In her welcoming remarks, the Principal Hong Kong Economic and Trade Representative (Tokyo), Miss Winsome Au, once again congratulated Korea for successfully hosting the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings last year, which was a landmark achievement. She noted that the high-level exchanges between Hong Kong and Korea in recent years provided a valuable platform for both places to strengthen collaboration and achieve results across a wide range of areas.

 She highlighted Hong Kong's unique position under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, underscoring Hong Kong's continued commitment to serving as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" linking the Chinese Mainland, Korea and the wider region. As a measure announced in the 2025 Policy Address, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau has set up the Economic and Trade Express. The platform focuses on supporting local small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups by proactively organising overseas business missions including Korea, while at the same time facilitating more enterprises to invest in and establish operations in Hong Kong, thereby promoting the two-way flow of enterprises and investments.

 Miss Au also remarked that Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul, held last year, showcased Hong Kong's East-meets-West creative strengths and drew over 540 000 attendees. The wide span of cultural performances and artistic showcases brought together about 800 Hong Kong and Korean artists and cultural practitioners through over 65 programmes.

 Tokyo ETO will continue to work closely with regional partners, including Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, to promote economic co-operation and people-to-people exchanges."

除了執法工作，消防人員在行動中亦向相關食肆負責人、租戶及物業管理人員進行防火宣傳及教育，講解常見火警隱患及預防措施。處方強調，持牌處所人流密集，火警風險相對較高，持牌人必須承擔消防安全責任，確保逃生途徑暢通無阻、防煙門保持關閉，並按法例規定安排消防裝置進行年檢及妥善維修。消防處將持續透過跨部門協作，確保持牌處所的消防安全，共同營造更安全的社區環境。"
"FSD, FEHD and BD conduct joint inspection and enforcement operation on licensed food premises",2026-02-12 19:15,2026-02-12 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200691.htm,"  The Fire Services Department (FSD), the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and the Buildings Department (BD) conducted a joint inspection and enforcement operation targeting licensed premises yesterday (February 11) to inspect the fire safety conditions of a total of 30 food premises in Causeway Bay and Yuen Long, with a view to ensuring public safety.

  During the operation, the FSD personnel identified multiple violations of the Fire Services (Fire Hazard Abatement) Regulation (Cap. 95F), including two cases of obstruction of means of escape, one case of wedged-open smoke stop doors, as well as 11 cases of fire service installations or equipment (FSIs) not being kept in efficient working order due to defects, removal or obstruction. The department took immediate enforcement action and issued 14 Fire Hazard Abatement Notices regarding the irregularities.

  The officers of the FEHD issued verbal warnings to seven licensed restaurants, requested them to rectify the situations for failing to meet licensing conditions due to poor hygiene conditions and maintenance of the premises and equipment. The licences will be cancelled if the violations continue. Moreover, the BD has preliminarily identified that the layouts of 14 food premises did not tally with the corresponding licensed plans. The BD, in collaboration with the FEHD (i.e. the licensing authority), is currently conducting further investigations. If any breaches of licensing conditions are established, the FEHD will also take appropriate enforcement action.

  Besides enforcement work, the fire personnel also carried out fire prevention publicity and education on common fire hazards and preventive measures for persons-in-charge of the relevant food premises, tenants and property management staff during the operation. The FSD emphasises that licensed premises have a high density of people and thus a relatively high fire risk. Licensees must bear the responsibility for fire safety, ensuring the means of escape are unobstructed, smoke stop doors remain closed at all times, and annual inspections and proper maintenance of FSIs are carried out as required by law. The FSD will continue to ensure the fire safety of licensed premises through interdepartmental collaboration and jointly build a safer community."
Shop providing RGA hair growth service suspected of operating unlicensed day procedure centre and possessing unregistered pharmaceutical product or Part 1 poison,2026-02-12 19:05,2026-02-12 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200675.htm,"​The Department of Health (DH) today (February 12) announced that a shop in Mongkok, operating without a day procedure centre (DPC) licence, is suspected of illegally performing autologous cell transplant and platelet-rich plasma injections. This contravenes the Private Healthcare Facilities Ordinance (Cap. 633) (the Ordinance) which prohibits operating a DPC without a licence.

Earlier, the DH received intelligence that a shop at Langham Place Office Tower, 8 Argyle Street, Mongkok, was promoting Regenera Activa (RGA) procedures, claiming that autologous cell injections into the scalp could stimulate hair growth. According to DH's records, the shop did not hold a DPC licence but was suspected of conducting related business. The DH, together with the Police, conducted a joint enforcement operation yesterday (February 11).

During the operation, devices and equipment used for RGA procedures and platelet-rich plasma processing and injections, as well as relevant records, were seized. The DH also seized 24 boxes of controlled drugs suspected to contain ""Tirzepatide"", which is a Part 1 poison and a prescription drug under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138). The product is alsosuspected to be an unregistered pharmaceutical product.The shop is therefore suspected of illegally possessing unregistered pharmaceutical products or Part 1 poisons.

In addition, doctors practising at the shop are suspected of performing high-risk medical procedures in premises without appropriate licence, therefore failing to act in patients' best interest when providing medical care. The DH has referred the case to the Medical Council of Hong Kong for follow-up.

The DH's investigation is ongoing. Appropriate actions will be taken against the shop and its responsible persons based on the evidence collected.

The RGA procedure offered by the shop involves autologous transplantation. Under the Ordinance, transplantation of any cells, tissues or organs, including autograft, allograft, xenograft, processed tissue or blood products (such as platelet-rich plasma) and skin flap, are scheduled medical procedures. Such procedures, when performed in an ambulatory setting, must take place in a licensed DPC. Any person operating a DPC without a licence commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for three years.

Furthermore, under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance, the illegal sale or possession of unregistered pharmaceutical products or Part 1 poisons constitutes a criminal offence. The maximum penalty for each offence upon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment.

The DH reminded business operators that premises providing medical procedures, including RGA or platelet-rich plasma injection, must obtain a DPC licence under the Ordinance. To assist the public in identifying licensed or exempted facilities, the DH has established the Private Healthcare Facilities Register, which lists all private healthcare facilities with valid licences and exemptions. DPCs must display their licence in a conspicuous place. Each licence bears a QR code that can be scanned using the eHealth app to verify its validity. For more information, please visit the DH's Office for Regulation of Private Healthcare Facilities webpage."

大家好！很高興出席中華人民共和國第十五屆運動會和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會香港特別行政區代表團嘉許禮。

四年一度的全運會（全國運動會），是國家水平最高、規模最大的綜合運動會，匯聚全國頂尖運動精英。今屆全運會和殘特奧會，首次由廣東、香港和澳門共同承辦，充分體現國家對粵港澳大灣區協同發展的堅定支持，更是香港融入國家發展大局的實踐之一，意義重大、影響深遠。

香港派出超過1 300位運動員參與全運會28個競賽項目和23個群眾項目，並派出超過280位運動員參與殘運會（殘疾人運動會）14個競賽項目、四個大眾項目，以及七項特奧會（特殊奧林匹克運動會）賽事，規模是歷來最大。

香港運動員優秀專業，締造了在全運會和殘特奧會中的歷來最佳成績。在全運會競賽及群眾項目，勇奪12金、八銀、11銅，共31面獎牌，在19個項目中躋身八強，以及贏得一個一等獎、兩個二等獎及一個三等獎。在殘特奧會，香港運動員奪得52金、50銀、40銅，共142面獎牌。

每一面獎牌的背後，都是無數個日夜的堅持與付出。我們看到香港運動員在賽場上的卓越表現，更應看到他們在訓練場上揮灑的汗水、克服的傷病，以及不斷挑戰極限的勇氣。你們展現了非凡的毅力和堅韌不拔的意志，無論順境逆境，始終全心投入。這份追求卓越、永不放棄的體育精神，以及團結協作、互相鼓勵的團隊精神，都是體育運動最令人支持的核心價值，為社會注入了強大的正能量。香港運動員在賽場上奮力拼搏，超越自我，大放異彩，為港爭光。讓我們一起，為我們的的運動員鼓掌！

特區政府重視體育，一直循着普及化、精英化、盛事化、專業化和產業化五個方向，持續投放大量資源，積極推動體育發展。在今個財政年度，政府用於推動體育發展的預算開支超過92億元，較十年前的43億元增加超過一倍。運動員的驕人成績，反映香港體育實力的提升，這既是運動員刻苦訓練的成果，也印證了政府持續培訓精英運動員和完善體育政策的方向正確，春華秋實，耕耘有成。

感謝所有支持運動員的社會各界人士和團體，包括運動員的家人、教練、醫療團隊、工作人員，以及各個體育相關機構。你們一直以來的付出，是運動員努力拼搏的堅強後盾。我亦感謝香港賽馬會贊助四億五千萬元，支持政府籌辦賽事，並透過賽馬會優秀運動員獎勵計劃向得獎運動員頒發現金獎勵，肯定他們持之以恆的努力。

粵港澳三地同心，不負重託，成功呈獻了簡約、安全、精彩的體育盛會，展現了三地緊密合作的豐碩成果，是大灣區融合發展的里程碑，為未來攜手舉辦更多國際大型盛事奠定基礎。三地政府將會以共同辦好全運會和殘特奧會的成功經驗作為新起點，進一步深化在體育方面的合作。香港會繼續積極發揮「一國兩制」下內聯外通的獨特優勢，全力促進大灣區的體育融合發展。

最後，我再次祝賀所有獲獎運動員。下星期，我們將喜迎農曆新年，希望需要繼續備戰、出戰比賽的運動員馬到功成；亦希望可以稍作休息的運動員，把握機會養精蓄銳、與家人、朋友共聚天倫。祝願各位在新的一年，繼續突破自我、再創高峰，共同為建設體育強國貢獻香港力量。多謝大家！"

粵港澳三地同心，不負重託，成功呈獻了簡約、安全、精彩的體育盛會，展現了三地緊密合作的豐碩成果，是大灣區融合發展的里程碑，為未來攜手舉辦更多國際大型盛事奠定基礎。三地政府將會以共同辦好全運會和殘特奧會的成功經驗作為新起點，進一步深化在體育方面的合作。香港會繼續積極發揮「一國兩制」下內聯外通的獨特優勢，全力促進大灣區的體育融合發展。

最後，我再次祝賀所有獲獎運動員。下星期，我們將喜迎農曆新年，希望需要繼續備戰、出戰比賽的運動員馬到功成；亦希望可以稍作休息的運動員，把握機會養精蓄銳、與家人、朋友共聚天倫。祝願各位在新的一年，繼續突破自我、再創高峰，共同為建設體育強國貢獻香港力量。多謝大家！"

大家好！很高興出席中華人民共和國第十五屆運動會和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會香港特別行政區代表團嘉許禮。

一間店鋪涉嫌無牌營辦日間醫療中心提供「RGA生髮服務」和非法管有未經註冊藥劑製品或第1部毒藥,2026-02-12 18:10,2026-02-12 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200657.htm,"​衞生署今日（二月十二日）表示，旺角一間沒領有日間醫療中心牌照的店鋪涉嫌非法進行自體細胞移植及注射高濃度血小板血漿程序，違反《私營醫療機構條例》（第633章）（《條例》）中禁止無牌營辦日間醫療中心的規定。

衞生署早前接獲線報，旺角亞皆老街8號朗豪坊辦公大樓有店鋪以提供Regenera Activa（RGA）醫療程序作招徠，聲稱為客人在頭皮注射自體細胞可達致生髮效果。根據衞生署記錄，該店鋪並無持有日間醫療中心牌照，卻涉嫌從事相關業務。衞生署昨日（二月十一日）聯同警方採取執法行動。

行動中，檢獲一批可用作RGA程序以及處理和注射高濃度血小板血漿的器械、用具和紀錄。此外，衞生署亦在店內檢獲共24盒懷疑含有「替爾泊肽」的受管制藥物，屬《藥劑業及毒藥條例》（第138章）下的第1部毒藥及處方藥物，並懷疑屬未經註冊藥劑製品，該店鋪涉嫌非法管有未經註冊藥劑製品或第1部毒藥。

此外，在該店內執業的醫生涉嫌在沒有合適牌照的處所進行高風險醫療程序，未能保障病人的最佳利益，衞生署已把相關個案轉介香港醫務委員會跟進。

衞生署的調查工作仍在進行，會因應所蒐集的資料及證據，對相關店鋪和負責人採取適當行動。

涉事店鋪所提供的RGA程序涉及自體細胞移植。根據《條例》，移植任何細胞、組織或器官，包括自體移植物、同種異體移植物、異種移植物、經處理的組織或血液製品（例如高濃度血小板血漿）及皮瓣，均屬《條例》訂明的「附表醫療程序」。在無需留醫的情況下施行該等程序，必須在持有有效牌照的日間醫療中心內進行。任何人士無牌營辦日間醫療中心即屬違法，一經定罪，可處罰款100,000元及監禁三年。

根據《藥劑業及毒藥條例》，非法售賣或管有未經註冊藥劑製品或第1部毒藥均屬刑事罪行，每項罪行一經定罪最高罰款100,000元及監禁兩年。

衞生署提醒商戶，提供RGA或高濃度血小板血漿的醫療程序服務的處所，必須按《條例》申領日間醫療中心的牌照。為方便市民識別提供醫療服務的處所是否獲發有效牌照或豁免書，衞生署已設立私營醫療機構登記冊，載錄所有獲發牌照和獲豁免書的私營醫療機構。日間醫療中心亦須把其牌照貼在當眼處，牌照上印有一個二維碼，市民可利用醫健通應用程式掃瞄牌照上的二維碼以確認該中心是否持有有效牌照。如欲了解更多資料，可瀏覽衞生署私營醫療機構規管辦公室網頁。"

海關人員於屋邨範圍內巡查及向居民介紹海關打擊私煙的工作和私煙相關法例的新修訂，包括未完稅煙草相關罪行的最高罰則已提高至罰款二百萬元及監禁七年，並向屋邨保安員講解發現懷疑私煙活動時的應對方法。

海關人員亦向議員、居民、報販及香煙零售商簡介香港將施行的完稅標籤制度。海關推出為期三個月的完稅標籤制度先導計劃已於本年初完成，海關會繼續與各持份者保持緊密溝通，持續優化制度設計及執行細節。海關計劃於今年第四季實施首階段的完稅標籤制度，並於二○二七年第二季全面推行有關制度，期望有效區分已完稅和未完稅香煙，打擊「白牌煙」。

海關會繼續加強宣傳教育，提高市民的反私煙意識。如發現有公屋單位涉及私煙罪行，海關會在法庭審結案件後通知房屋署跟進。海關呼籲市民，切勿以身試法買賣私煙或派發私煙傳單，以免留下案底影響前途。

根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/）舉報懷疑私煙活動。

Hong Kong Customs conducts interdepartmental anti-illicit cigarette publicity activities in Eastern District (with photos),2026-02-12 18:02,2026-02-12 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200623.htm,"​Hong Kong Customs on February 10 and today (February 12) conducted joint anti-illicit cigarette publicity activities with Legislative Council Member Ms Chik Kit-ling, members of the Eastern District Council, the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the Department of Health, the Police and the Housing Department (HD) at Hing Wah (2) Estate, Yue Wan Estate, Wan Tsui Estate and Siu Sai Wan Estate in Eastern District. Customs also publicised the Duty Stamp System.

Customs officers patrolled the housing estates and introduced to residents Customs' enforcement actions against illicit cigarettes and the latest amendments to illicit cigarette-related legislation, including an increase in the maximum penalty for offences related to duty-not-paid cigarettes to a $2 million fine and seven-year imprisonment. Customs also explained to estate security personnel how to deal with suspected illicit cigarette activities.

Customs officers also introduced the Duty Stamp System to be implemented in Hong Kong to the council members, residents, newspaper stall keepers and cigarette retailers. The three-month Pilot Run for the Duty Stamp System launched by Customs concluded early this year. Customs will continue to maintain close communication with all stakeholders and optimise the design and implementation details of the system. Customs plans to implement the first phase of the Duty Stamp System in the fourth quarter this year, with full implementation in the second quarter of 2027, thus achieving the ultimate goal of effective distinguishment of duty-paid cigarettes from duty-not-paid ones, and to combat ""cheap whites"".

Customs will continue to strengthen publicity and education to raise the public awareness of anti-illicit cigarettes. If public rental housing units are found to be involved in illicit cigarette crimes, Customs will notify the HD for follow-up action after the conclusion of court proceedings. Customs reminds members of the public not to buy or sell illicit cigarettes or distribute illicit cigarette leaflets to avoid creating a criminal record that could affect their future.

Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years. Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/).

In accordance with the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Cap. 371), no person shall distribute any smoking product advertisement (including any promotional leaflets). Any person who contravenes the regulation is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000. Members of the public may report any suspected activities of illicit cigarette leaflets distribution to TACO's hotline 2961 8823."

HKMA 2026 Chinese New Year anti-fraud and electronic lai-see campaign,2026-02-12 17:40,2026-02-12 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200613.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) today (February 12) launched the 2026 anti-fraud public education campaign themed ""Unite to Fight Scams"", and introduced a new series of animated Year of the Horse stickers, ""Horse Butler"", as the Chinese New Year approaches, integrating anti-fraud messages into the everyday scenario of distributing electronic red packets (lai-see).

(1) Anti-Fraud Public Education Campaign 2026 (Annex)
The first campaign project utilises artificial intelligence technology to create a brand-new anti-fraud music video. Based on the concept of Kung Fu (martial arts) game, Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA Mr Arthur Yuen transforms into a game character, facing off against the original fraudster character ""Lachachu"" (despicable banana in Cantonese) in a battle between good and evil.

In the music video, the ""Lachachu"" utilises the myriads of changing identities to swindle members of the public out of their trust, personal information, and money. Through this ""good versus evil"" duel, the HKMA aims to rally public attention and collective efforts to combat scams.

The trailer has been released on the HKMA social media platforms, with the full version to be launched soon.

(2) ""Horse Butler"" Animated Stickers (Annex)
The new series features the HKMA’s original character, ""Horse Butler"", and includes 10 animated stickers covering themes such as festive greetings, daily transfers, financial innovation, and fraud prevention.

The HKMA encourages the public to distribute lai-see via the Faster Payment System or other e-wallets, and wishes to remind the public to protect their savings and guard against fraud when sending festive greetings to relatives and friends.

The sticker series has been uploaded to official platforms (Chinese version only); the public should download it only through official channels. WhatsApp users can visit: whatsticker.online/p/781320YRPwk4T/HK/zh, or search for ""金管局 – 2026馬年行大運"" in the WhatSticker app to download; WeChat users can download it from the ""香港金融管理局"" WeChat official account.

(3) Beware of Chinese New Year Sticker Scams
Lately, there have been fraudsters distributing fraudulent Chinese New Year stickers or electronic lai-see with phishing QR codes or hyperlinks via instant messaging software, tricking users into receiving lai-see or greeting cards, and attempting to steal personal information or money. Members of the public should stay highly vigilant during the festive season.

The HKMA reiterates that it will not contact individualmembers of the public regarding personal financial matters, nor will it direct them to conduct transactions or provide any sensitive personal information via SMS or hyperlinks."
Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-12 17:30,2026-02-12 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200581.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 12), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere is currently in the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

​
The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球正值冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

環境局會協調各相關政策局和部門的工作，建立以高速充電樁為骨幹的電動車充電網絡，全面支援電動車在香港應用；成立工作組，物色適合本地使用的電動商用車輛，支援電動商用車普及化；透過新能源運輸基金和低碳綠色科研基金，資助研發相關環保技術，至今兩個基金就電動車的試驗或研發的資助金額已接近兩億元。

為探討解決中國內地和香港電動車充電制式不同的問題，以及推動充電制式國際化，國家能源局與環境局將合作，就新一代電動車充電技術ChaoJi推出先導計劃，目標是在二○二七年完成ChaoJi香港充電示範站建設，助力國家把創新充電技術「引進來、走出去」。

國家的電動車產業無論是規模或創新均領先全球，政府會向有意在港推動電動車的企業提供政策支持和統籌協調，利用香港的國際金融科技樞紐地位作為全球布局的橋頭堡，幫助國家的電動車產業和技術出海，也推動電動車在全球普及化。

（二）電動私家車

在政府的大力推動和持份者的共同努力下，電動車在香港迅速發展，四年間增長四倍至超過14萬輛，電動私家車增速位處世界前列。估計在二○三○年，香港電動私家車的數量有望超過29萬輛，至二○三五年更可能趨近50萬輛。現時電動私家車的技術已臻成熟，車款供應大幅增加，價格和傳統燃油私家車相比亦開始具市場競爭力，電動私家車普及化已經逐漸由市場力量主導，未來政府將主要透過充電網絡建設、維修培訓及電池回收等，完善配套設施和方便使用者，以支援私家車綠色轉型。雖然國際間有地方放緩車輛電動化的進程，但香港會維持在二○三五年或之前停止新登記包括混合動力的燃油私家車的目標，配合國家決心實現碳中和。

（三）電動商用車

現階段電動商用車在技術和市場的發展整體仍然處於初期階段，成熟條件不如電動私家車。部分車種，包括專營巴士、的士和輕型客貨車較其他商用車車種，相對上較具達到規模化應用的條件，政府會以務實的態度，逐步推廣達到規模化應用條件的商用車種。至於未達規模化應用階段的電動商用車車種，政府將成立工作小組，物色適合本地應用的電動商用車，為其未來規模化應用創造條件。

（四）充電網絡

香港在二○一一年開始透過收緊總樓面面積豁免安排來促使新建的停車場車位備有充電基礎設施，二○二○年推出EV屋苑充電易資助計劃，現時已有約13萬個私人樓宇及屋苑停車位具備充電設施；公共充電樁數目亦由二○二一年的約4 700支增加2.5倍至現時約16 500支，可以支援約10萬輛電動車，預計二○二七年年中公共和私人充電停車位數目將提升至約20萬個，足以支援超過30萬輛電動車。

未來政府會善用市場力量，透過政策導向建設以高速充電樁為骨幹的公共充電網絡，目標是在二○三○年有不少於4 000支高速充電樁，可支援約20萬輛電動車，並期望在二○三五年達到約1萬支高速充電樁，可支援約50萬輛電動車。連同大量配備充電設施的停車位，將更方便電動車的使用者。

（五）配套措施

全港首間大型電動車電池回收設施現正在環保園進行建設，預計設施於二○二六年上半年啓用，將退役電池轉化為再生黑粉供應內地和周邊地區。有關回收設施不但有助促進電動車電池回收產業發展，提升香港在區域綠色產業鏈的角色，更為粵港澳大灣區環保產業的互利合作提供良好示範。

政府亦已展開工作，更新《電動車輛充電設施技術指引》，目標是在本年年底前完成，以配合最新的電動車發展。此外，政府正與大專院校合作推動電動車技術及維修人才的進修培訓，截至去年十二月，約有1 100名技工已完成相關培訓課程。

發言人表示：「氣候變化問題日益嚴峻，推動可持續綠色運輸已成為全球共識。《更新版》的各項措施將為未來的車輛電動化進程奠定切合本地情況的基礎，務實推動電動車輛普及化，引領行業邁向綠色轉型。」

Government updates Hong Kong Roadmap on Popularisation of Electric Vehicles,2026-02-12 17:28,2026-02-12 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200268.htm,"The Government today (February 12) announced the Updated Version of the Hong Kong Roadmap on Popularisation of Electric Vehicles (the Updated Roadmap). The Updated Roadmap reviews the development of electric vehicle (EV) technology over the past decade, summarises the progress that has been made to promote EV popularisation in Hong Kong since the Government formulated the Hong Kong Roadmap on Popularisation of Electric Vehicles (the Roadmap) in 2021, and updates the strategies and measures adopted by the Government to promote EV popularisation.

A spokesman for the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) said, ""The Government formulated the Roadmap in 2021, setting the target of ceasing new registration of fuel-propelled private cars, including hybrid vehicles, in 2035 or earlier, with a view to achieving zero vehicular emissions before 2050 and supporting Hong Kong's carbon neutrality goal before 2050. The Government also announced the Green Transformation Roadmap of Public Buses and Taxis in 2024.

""To ensure that our policies keep pace with the times, after fully considering the latest technological developments, the local progress in EV popularisation, and views from the industry, we have updated the Roadmap. It summarises our policy direction to pragmatically and continuously promote the development of the EV market in Hong Kong to achieve zero vehicular emissions before 2050.""

Building on the original Roadmap, the Updated Roadmap outlines five areas with a total of 28 measures, summarised as follows:

(1) Policy promotion

The EEB will co-ordinate relevant policy bureaux and departments to establish an EV charging network underpinned by fast chargers to fully support EV applications in Hong Kong; establish a working group to identify suitable electric commercial vehicles for local use and support their popularisation; and provide funding through the New Energy Transport Fund and the Green Tech Fund for research and development of related green technologies. To date, the two funds have provided nearly $200 million in funding for EV trials and research and development.

To address the inconsistency in EV charging standards between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong, and to promote the internationalisation of charging standards, the National Energy Administration and the EEB will collaborate to launch a pilot scheme for the next-generation EV charging technology ChaoJi, with the target to complete the construction of ChaoJi charging demonstration stations in Hong Kong by 2027. This will facilitate the ""bringing in and going global"" of the country's innovative charging technology.

China's EV industry leads globally in both scale and innovation. The Government will provide policy support and co-ordination to enterprises seeking to promote EVs in Hong Kong, leveraging Hong Kong's status as an international fintech hub and also a bridgehead for global expansion to help China's EV industry and technology go global, and to promote the popularisation of EVs worldwide.

(2) Electric private cars

With vigorous promotion by the Government and concerted efforts of stakeholders, EVs have developed rapidly in Hong Kong, growing more than fourfold in four years to over 140 000 units, with the electric private car growth rate ranking among the highest in the world. It is estimated that the number of electric private cars could surpass 290 000 by 2030 and approach nearly 500 000 by 2035. Electric private car technology has matured, with substantially increased models and prices becoming competitive with conventional fuel-propelled private cars. The popularisation of electric private cars is gradually driven by market forces. Going forward, the Government will support the green transition of private cars by improving supporting facilities and user convenience, primarily through charging network expansion, maintenance training, and battery recycling. While some international regions have slowed vehicle electrification, Hong Kong will maintain the target of ceasing new registrations of fuel-propelled private cars, including hybrid vehicles, in 2035 or earlier, to align with the national commitment to carbon neutrality.

(3) Electric commercial vehicles

At present, the overall electrification of commercial vehicles is still in its early stages of technological and market development, lagging behind those of electric private cars. Certain vehicle types, including franchised buses, taxis, van-type light goods vehicles, have achieved a relatively mature stage of large-scale application. The Government will adopt a pragmatic approach to progressively promote the large-scale application of these vehicle types. For electric commercial vehicles that have not yet reached the stage of large-scale application, a working group will be established to introduce more models suitable for local use and create conditions for their future large-scale applications.

(4) Charging network

Hong Kong began promoting the installation of charging infrastructure in new car park spaces through tightened gross floor area exemption arrangements in 2011. Coupled with the EV-charging at Home Subsidy Scheme launched in 2020, there are now approximately 130 000 parking spaces equipped with charging infrastructure in private buildings and estate car parks in Hong Kong. The number of public chargers has also increased to 2.5 times the approximately 4 700 in 2021, reaching approximately 16 500 at present, sufficient to support about 100 000 EVs. It is expected that by mid-2027, the number of public and private parking spaces equipped with charging infrastructure will go up to about 200 000, capable of supporting over 300 000 EVs.

The Government will leverage market forces in the future through policy guidance to build a public charging network with fast chargers as the backbone. The target is to increase the number of fast chargers to no less than 4 000 by 2030, supporting approximately 200 000 EVs, and it is expected that this number will further increase to around 10 000 fast chargers by 2035, altogether supporting approximately 500 000 EVs. Coupled with a large number of parking spaces equipped with EV charging infrastructure, EV owners will find it more convenient.

(5) Supporting measures

Hong Kong's first large-scale EV battery recycling facility is under construction at the EcoPark and is expected to commence operation in the first half of 2026, converting end-of-life EV batteries into recycled black mass to supply the Chinese Mainland and neighbouring areas. The recycling facility will not only promote the development of the EV battery recycling industry and strengthen Hong Kong's role in the regional green industry chain but also serve as a good model for mutually beneficial co-operation in the environmental industry of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

To keep pace with the latest developments of EVs, the Government has recently commenced work to update the Technical Guidelines on Charging Facilities for EVs and aims for completion by the end of 2026. Furthermore, the Government is collaborating with tertiary institutions to promote the continuing education and training of EV technicians and maintenance personnel. As at December 2025, approximately 1 100 technicians have completed these training courses.

The spokesperson added, ""With climate change becoming increasingly severe, promoting sustainable green transport has become a global consensus. The measures in the Updated Roadmap will lay a foundation tailored to local conditions for future vehicle electrification, pragmatically promote EV popularisation, and lead the industry towards green transformation.""

DH reminds public to remain vigilant against infectious diseases and food poisoning to stay healthy during Chinese New Year,2026-02-12 17:25,2026-02-12 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200576.htm,"​With the Chinese New Year holidays approaching, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (February 12) reminded the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene and adopt appropriate measures to guard against infectious diseases and food poisoning, both locally and when travelling abroad. The public should avoid travelling or participating in gatherings when feeling unwell.

Seasonal influenza and other respiratory diseases
---------------------------------------------------------

Although the influenza activity in Hong Kong is currently at a low, influenza activity still remains at a relatively high level in many popular travel destinations for Hong Kong citizens, such as some areas in North America and Europe. Moreover, the overall influenza activity has increased again in Korea and Japan recently, with the major circulating virus strain having changed from the earlier influenza A (H3) to influenza B. People who will travel should pay attention to the influenza situation at their destinations before departure.

  ""With the increase in cross-border travel and the number of incoming visitors, the risk of influenza transmission will also increase. Moreover, based on past experience, Hong Kong's winter influenza season typically occurs in the first quarter. With the persistent cold weather and the possibility of a change in circulating virus strains, it cannot be ruled out that the influenza activity will increase again later. Receiving seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) is still one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of hospitalisation and death from infection. The public should receive vaccination as soon as possible regardless of staying locally or planning to travel abroad, as it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body for sufficient protection against the influenza virus. All individuals aged 6 months or older, except those with known contraindications, should act promptly if they have not yet received an SIV, including those who contracted influenza in the past few months, in order to safeguard personal health,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

Regarding other respiratory diseases, although COVID-19 activity is currently maintaining a low level, there are generally periodic upsurges in the COVID-19 activity level approximately every six to nine months. It has been over seven months since the end of last periodic upsurge of COVID-19 activity. There may be another periodic upsurge in Hong Kong in the next few months. Members of the public should receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a timely manner to reduce the risk of serious illness and death due to COVID-19. Under the current Government's COVID-19 Vaccination Programme, individuals aged 6 months or above are eligible for free initial vaccine doses. High-risk priority groups can receive booster doses for free at least six months after the last dose or COVID-19 infection (whichever is later), regardless of the number of doses received previously.

In addition, the activity of the respiratory syncytial virus is maintaining a high level in many regions in North America and Europe.

To prevent respiratory diseases, members of the public should maintain good personal, hand and environmental hygiene. Members of the public with respiratory symptoms, even if the symptoms are mild, should wear a surgical mask, avoid crowded places and seek medical advice promptly. They should maintain hand hygiene before putting on and after removing a mask.

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE), norovirus infection and food poisoning
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Norovirus food poisoning cases related to consumption of raw oysters have significantly increased recently. Members of the public, especially pregnant women, young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems or liver diseases, should stay vigilant during Chinese New Year meal gatherings, avoid consumption of raw oysters or partially cooked bivalve shellfish. In general, the norovirus is more active in winter (around December to March). As the norovirus is highly contagious, individuals may become infected after being exposed to even a small amount of it. The norovirus can be transmitted through various means, such as eating contaminated food, contacting the vomit or excreta of infected persons, and contacting contaminated objects, leading to the possibility of a large-scale outbreak,"" Dr Tsui said.

In addition to food poisoning, the norovirus can also cause AGE. Norovirus activity in neighbouring areas, including Japan and Korea, has also been increasing. Norovirus activity in Korea has surpassed the levels seen in the same periods of the past few years. Locally, the number of AGE outbreaks has continued to increase since early January this year. There have been 40 AGE outbreaks recorded so far this year (as of February 11), involving 306 persons. According to the CHP's sentinel surveillance data, the AGE activity level has also shown an upward trend recently in Family Medicine Clinics, private medical practitioner clinics and child care centres/kindergartens.

  ""To prevent food poisoning, apart from maintaining personal hygiene, all food should also be thoroughly washed and cooked before consumption. Before handling food or eating, and after using the toilet, members of the public should wash hands with liquid soap and water, and rub for at least 20 seconds, then rinse with water and dry with a disposable paper towel or hand dryer. Since alcohol is not effective in killing the norovirus, alcohol-based handrubs are not a substitute for handwashing with soap and water,"" Dr Tsui said.

Mosquito-borne diseases
------------------------------

Six dengue fever cases have been recorded in Hong Kong so far this year. All of them were imported cases. The patients had travelled to the Philippines, Indonesia, Cambodia, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam during the incubation period. Regarding chikungunya fever (CF), Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported from the Seychelles.

""Although the northern hemisphere is currently in the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. The public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries. To prevent mosquito-borne diseases, travellers should wear loose, light-coloured, long-sleeved tops and trousers, and apply insect repellent containing DEET to exposed parts of the body and clothing. Travellers returning from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong,"" Dr Tsui said.

Measles
----------

  Measles outbreaks in North America (namely the United States, Canada and Mexico), and Southeast Asian regions (including Indonesia, Cambodia and the Philippines) are ongoing due to the relatively low vaccination coverage rate in recent years. There have been over 730 cases recorded in the United States so far this year, significantly higher than the same period last year. Furthermore, the number of measles cases in Japan has also risen significantly, with 23 cases recorded as of February 4, compared to only one case in the same period last year. The number of measles cases recorded this year in Singapore and Australia were higher than the same period last year. Most overseas cases mainly affected people who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. This shows the importance of maintaining a high vaccination rate and herd immunity within the community.

""Pregnant women and women preparing for pregnancy who are not immune to measles or rubella, as well as children aged under 1 year who are not due for the first dose of the measles, mumps and rubella-combined vaccine under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme are advised not to travel to places with outbreaks of measles. The incubation period of measles is seven to 21 days. Symptoms include fever, skin rash, cough, runny nose and red eyes. If such symptoms appear after returning from measles-endemic areas, people should wear surgical masks, stay home from work or school, avoid crowded places and contact with unvaccinated people, especially those with weak immune systems, pregnant women and children under 1 year old, and should consult their doctors as soon as possible,"" Dr Tsui said.

Nipah virus infection
---------------------------

Nipah virus infection is an emerging zoonotic disease. The natural host of the virus is the fruit bat. It can affect various animals, including pigs, horses, goats, sheep, cats and dogs. According to the latest information from the World Health Organization (WHO), two confirmed cases of Nipah virus infection have recently been recorded in the North 24 Parganas District of West Bengal State, India, and one in Rajshahi, northwestern Bangladesh respectively.

The WHO has assessed the global public health risk posed by Nipah virus as low. Nevertheless, if travel to Nipah virus-affected areas is unavoidable, contact with wild animals or sick farm animals, especially bats, farmed pigs, horses, domestic and feral cats should be avoided. Furthermore, members of the public should thoroughly wash and peel fruits before consumption and avoid eating fruits with signs of bat bites or found on the ground. Drinking raw date palm sap, toddy or other juice should be avoided.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
--------------------------------------------

The affected areas of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome primarily include the Arabian Peninsula and its neighboring countries. Over 85 per cent of the confirmed cases were reported by Middle East countries or exported to other countries directly from the Middle East. Members of the public travelling to the Middle East should avoid visiting farms, barns or markets where there are dromedary camels, as well as contact with patients and animals, especially dromedary camels. Moreover, travel agents organising tours to the Middle East should refrain from arranging visitors to ride dromedary camels or to participate in any activities involving direct contact with dromedary camels.

""Members of the public returning to Hong Kong after travelling abroad should consult a doctor promptly if they develop symptoms such as fever, respiratory symptoms, rash or gastroenteritis symptoms, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment. The CHP will continue to monitor the situation of infectious diseases locally and abroad and provide timely updates to members of the public to keep them informed about the development of infectious diseases and help them prepare for precautionary measures,"" Dr Tsui said.

Marine traffic control and safety measures to be implemented at 2026 Chinese New Year Fireworks Display,2026-02-12 17:00,2026-02-12 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200284.htm,"  The Marine Department (MD) today (February 12) reminded the public that with regard to the 2026 Chinese New Year Fireworks Display to be held on February 18 (the event day), the MD will strictly enforce marine traffic control and strengthen the inspection of spectator vessels on the event day to ensure that safety requirements are met.

 A Closed Area in the waters off the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, where barges for the fireworks display are to be anchored, will be established from 2pm to about 10.30pm on the event day. A Restricted Area will be established in the Central Harbour from 7pm to about 9pm on the event day. Other than authorised vessels, no vessels will be allowed to enter these two areas. Scheduled ferry vessels with permission may continue services until 7.40pm.

 Spectator vessels may stay inside the Specified Area, excluding the Restricted Area and the Closed Area, for viewing from 6pm to about 9pm (specified period) on the event day. To enhance marine safety during this major event at sea, coxswains of spectator vessels in the Specified Area during the specified period must ensure that children on board are accompanied by an adult and wear a lifejacket at all times. Coxswains must also keep a passenger and crew list on board for emergency purposes. The MD will step up vessel inspections. If any vessel fails to meet these requirements, the department will initiate prosecution.

 In addition, to ensure that vessels disperse in an orderly manner, the Eastern and Western Cordon Lines of the Restricted Area will be lifted in stages after the event. The Western Cordon Line will be lifted first at about 9pm. Spectator vessels behind the Western Cordon Line and those wishing to move east must follow the instructions of officers from the MD and the Police at the scene. The Eastern Cordon Line will be lifted later, depending on traffic conditions in Victoria Harbour. It is anticipated that the Restricted Area will be lifted by about 9.15pm on the event day.

 For landside crowd control, the public landing steps No. 1 to 4 at Kowloon Public Pier will be closed temporarily from 6pm to about 9pm, and the public landing steps No. 5 and 6 will be closed temporarily from 6pm to about midnight.

在二○二五年第四季，房屋局成功安排總數多達約8 800個一般申請者入住傳統公屋或「簡約公屋」，包括約3 600個新落成的傳統公屋單位、約3 800個回收的傳統公屋單位，以及約1 400個「簡約公屋」單位，供應龐大，有效縮短公屋輪候隊伍。獲安排入住傳統公屋單位的一般申請者中，約七成入住市區或擴展市區單位，入住新界單位（包括新落成的上水彩石邨及傳統公屋回收單位）的申請者亦較上一季多。由於市區或擴展市區單位都非常受申請者歡迎，輪候時間比新界長約兩年之多，因而當他們的輪候時間被計算在內時，公屋綜合輪候時間反而未有下降。

另一方面，入住「簡約公屋」的一般申請者的輪候時間則明顯較短，整體的公屋綜合輪候時間在二○二五年十二月底得以維持在5.1年的水平。事實上，自首個「簡約公屋」項目於二○二五年第一季開始編配入住以來，獲安排入住「簡約公屋」的一般申請者的輪候時間平均僅為3.2年，充分突顯「簡約公屋」不僅改善了低收入家庭的居住環境和質素，更在縮短公屋輪候時間上發揮了關鍵作用。與租住分間單位相比，入住「簡約公屋」的居民亦可以平均每年省下逾50,000元的租金，成為日後家庭的儲蓄，為家庭籌劃更好的未來。

此外，在房屋局採取多管齊下的方法加快公屋單位流轉的努力下，輪候公屋的一般申請者數目進一步下降。在二○二五年十二月底，約有106 300宗一般公屋申請，以及約81 500宗配額及計分制下的非長者一人申請。與最高位的156 400宗及143 700宗比較，一般公屋申請及非長者一人申請的數目分別大幅下降超過30%及超過40%；當中，30歲以下的非長者一人申請的跌幅更為明顯，在過去十年間由約74 500宗下跌60%至二○二五年十二月底約29 500宗，清楚顯示公屋輪候隊伍正在消化中。

公屋編配數目連續兩年大幅高於新登記申請

房屋署對公屋一般申請者在二○二五年獲編配入住傳統公屋或「簡約公屋」的情況進行了分析，結果顯示，隨着陸續有新的公屋項目落成以及房屋署近年加強打擊濫用公屋政策的成效顯著，再加上房委會多個「居者有其屋計劃」及「綠表置居計劃」項目相繼落成入伙，不少公屋租戶因購買了資助出售單位而騰出其公屋單位，令二○二五年獲編配入住公屋的一般申請數目維持逾20 000宗的高位，比同年新登記的14 500宗一般申請多近6 300宗，消化了不少長期積壓的申請個案。值得注意的是，每年獲編配入住傳統公屋的一般申請數目，遠高於同年新登記申請的情況，已連續兩年在二○二四年及二○二五年出現，這是房委會有記錄以來的首次。這正正反映本屆政府對提升公營房屋供應及縮短公屋輪候時間的決心，以及各項政策成效顯著且具持續性。

總體公營房屋建屋量進入高峰期

展望二○二六／二七年度起的五年，總體公營房屋建屋量 （包括「簡約公屋」）將超過195 000個單位，較本屆政府上任時增加超過80%。當中，共有約115 000個傳統公屋單位將在此期間落成，供應進入高峰期。「簡約公屋」方面，二○二五年已有約9 500個單位陸續落成入伙，而在二○二六年及二○二七年初則分別會有約20 300個及200個單位相繼落成，逐步邁向在二○二七／二八年度前完成興建約30 000個「簡約公屋」單位的目標。

在本屆政府三年多以來全力「提速、提量、提質、提效」的不懈努力下， 公營房屋落成量已完全扭轉了「頭輕尾重」的情況，可加快滿足低收入家庭的住屋需求。公屋綜合輪候時間在二○二六／二七年度回落至 4.5 年的目標不變。"
Housing Bureau releases latest quarterly Composite Waiting Time for Subsidised Rental Housing,2026-02-12 16:38,2026-02-12 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200337.htm,"  The Housing Bureau (HB) released today (February 12) the latest quarterly Composite Waiting Time for Subsidised Rental Housing (CWT).

  As at end-December 2025, the CWT for general applicants (i.e. family and elderly one-person applicants) that were housed in public rental housing (PRH) or Light Public Housing (LPH) in the past 12 months has continued to remain at 5.1 years, which is again the lowest record since the first quarter of 2018. Compared with the highest level of 6.1 years before the current-term Government took office, the CWT has been shortened by a full year.

  It is noteworthy that the number of applicants housed in PRH in 2025 has maintained a high level of over 20 000 cases, nearly 6300 cases more than the newly registered general applications of 14500 cases in the same year, which has cleared up a certain amount of long-standing backlogged applications. The number of general applications allocated PRH each year has far exceeded the number of new applications registered in the same year for two consecutive years (namely 2024 and 2025), which is the first time since records became available for the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA).

Huge PRH and LPH supply has effectively shortened the PRH waiting list

  In the fourth quarter of 2025, the HB has successfully arranged a total of about 8 800 general applicants to be housed in PRH or LPH, including about 3 600 newly completed PRH flats, about 3 800 recovered PRH flats, and about 1 400 LPH units. The huge housing supply has effectively shortened the PRH waiting list. Among the general applicants housed in PRH, about 70 per cent were housed in the urban district and extended urban district, while more applicants, as compared with the last quarter, were housed in flats in the New Territories (including the newly completed Choi Shek Estate in Sheung Shui and recovered PRH flats). Since the urban district and extended urban district are very popular districts among applicants, their waiting time is about two years longer than that for the New Territories, thus when their waiting time has been taken into account, the CWT has not decreased.

  On the other hand, the waiting time of general applicants housed in LPH is obviously shorter, the overall CWT has managed to stay at 5.1 years as at end-December 2025. In fact, since the first LPH project began allocation in the first quarter of 2025, the waiting time of general applicants who were housed in LPH is only 3.2 years on average. This fully highlights that LPH has not only improved living conditions and the quality of life of low-income families, but has also played a key role in shortening the waiting time for PRH. As compared with subdivided units, residents who are housed in LPH can also save an average of over $50,000 in rent per year, which can be accumulated as family savings to plan for a better future.

  In addition, with the HB's multipronged approach to expedite the turnover of PRH flats, the number of PRH general applicants has further decreased. As at end-December 2025, there were about 106 300 general applications for PRH, and about 81 500 non-elderly one-person applications under the Quota and Points System. As compared with the highest level of 156400 cases and 143700 cases of general applications and non-elderly one-person applications, the application number has been reduced significantly by more than 30 per cent and over 40 per cent respectively. In addition, the number of non-elderly one-person applicants aged below 30 recorded an even sharper decline of 60 per cent over the 10-year period, from about 74 500 to about 29 500 as at end-December 2025, clearly demonstrating that the PRH waiting queue is being reduced.

Public housing allocations outpace new applications for two consecutive years

  The Housing Department (HD) has conducted an analysis of the housing situation of general applicants that were housed in PRH or LPH in 2025. The results show that, following the gradual completion of new PRH projects, the significant results achieved by the HD in its enhanced effectiveness in combating tenancy abuse in recent years, coupled with the completion and occupancy of several Home Ownership Scheme projects and Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme projects by the HA, a significant number of PRH tenants vacated their PRH flats due to their purchase of subsidised sale flats. As a result, the number of applicants housed in PRH in 2025 has maintained a high level of over 20 000 cases, nearly 6300 cases more than the newly registered general applications of 14500 cases in the same year, which has cleared up a certain amount of long-standing backlogged applications. It is noteworthy that the number of general applications allocated PRH each year has far exceeded the number of new applications registered in the same year for two consecutive years, 2024 and 2025, which is the first time since records became available for the HA. This reflects the current-term Government's determination to increase the supply of public housing and to shorten the PRH waiting time, as well as the significant and sustainable effectiveness of its various policies.

The overall public housing production is reaching its peak

  Looking ahead at the five years starting from 2026-27 onwards, the overall public housing production (including LPH) will reach over 195 000 units, over 80 per cent higher than when the current-term Government took office, among which, about 115 000 PRH flats will be completed during this period, reaching the peak in supply. In respect of LPH, about 9 500 units have been gradually completed in 2025, and about 20 300 and 200 units will be successively completed in 2026 and early 2027 respectively, gradually moving towards the target of completing the construction of about 30 000 units by 2027-28.

  Under the current-term Government's unremitting efforts to ""enhance speed, quantity, quality and efficiency"" in the past three years, the back-loaded situation has been completely reversed by the public housing production. This shift has enabled faster fulfilment of the housing needs of low-income families. The target of reducing the CWT to 4.5 years by 2026-27 remains unchanged."

表一列出二零二五年年底的總人口，而表二則列出二零一四年年中至二零二五年年底的人口數字。

評論

政府發言人表示，二零二五年年底整體人口較二零二四年年底有所增加。受惠於各項吸引人才和輸入勞工措施，吸引來自世界各地人士移入香港，從而抵銷人口自然減少的影響。

進一步資料

「常住居民」指兩類人士：（一）在統計時點之前的六個月內，在港逗留最少三個月，又或在統計時點之後的六個月內，在港逗留最少三個月的香港永久性居民，不論在統計時點他們是否身在香港；及（二）在統計時點身在香港的香港非永久性居民。

對於不是「常住居民」的香港永久性居民，如他們在統計時點之前的六個月內，在港逗留最少一個月但少於三個月，又或在統計時點之後的六個月內，在港逗留最少一個月但少於三個月，不論在統計時點他們是否身在香港，會被界定為「流動居民」。

根據慣例，每次發表最新的人口數字為「臨時數字」。而經修訂的數字會在其後的六個月公布。即是說，二零二五年年底人口的臨時數字於今天公布，而修訂數字將於二零二六年八月公布。"
Year-end Population for 2025,2026-02-12 16:30,2026-02-12 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200283.htm,"According to the statistics released by the Census and Statistics Department today (February 12), the provisional estimate of the Hong Kong population was 7 510 800 at end-2025, representing an increase of 10 200 or 0.1% from 7 500 600 at end-2024.

A net inflow of 29 100 Hong Kong residents (i.e. inflow more than outflow) was recorded during the period from end-2024 to end-2025. Over the same period, a natural decrease (i.e. deaths surpassing births) of 18 900 was recorded, with 31 100 births and 50 000 deaths.

Among the total population at end-2025, 7 242 400 were Usual Residents and 268 400 were Mobile Residents. The revised figure for the mid-year population for 2025 was 7 498 900. The number of Usual Residents was revised to 7 232 900 and the number of Mobile Residents to 266 000. The rate of change in population from mid-2024 to mid-2025 was also revised to -0.3%.

Table 1 presents estimated total population as at end-2025, while Table 2 presents population figures from mid-2014 to end-2025.

Commentary

A government spokesperson said that the overall population in end-2025 increased as compared to end-2024, benefiting from various measures on talent attraction and labour importation that brought people into Hong Kong from other places around the world to offset the impact of natural population decrease.

Further information

""Usual Residents"" refer to two categories of people: (1) Hong Kong Permanent Residents who have stayed in Hong Kong for at least three months during the six months before or for at least three months during the six months after the reference time-point, regardless of whether they are in Hong Kong or not at the reference time-point; and (2) Hong Kong Non-permanent Residents who are in Hong Kong at the reference time-point.

For those Hong Kong Permanent Residents who are not ""Usual Residents"", they are classified as ""Mobile Residents"" if they have stayed in Hong Kong for at least one month but less than three months during the six months before or for at least one month but less than three months during the six months after the reference time-point, regardless of whether they are in Hong Kong or not at the reference time-point.

Under the current practice, the latest population estimate is released on a provisional basis in each round. The revised estimate will be released six months later. In other words, while the provisional population estimate for end-2025 is released today, the corresponding revised estimate will be released in August 2026."

As regards price changes in 2025 over 2024, the prices of total exports of goods and imports of goods increased by 2.3% and 2.2% respectively.

Price changes in external merchandise trade are reflected by changes in unit value indices of external merchandise trade, which are compiled based on average unit values or, for certain commodities, specific price data.

The terms of trade index is derived from the ratio of price index of total exports of goods to that of imports of goods. Compared with the same periods in 2024, the index increased by 0.3% in December 2025, whereas it remained virtually unchanged in 2025 as a whole.

Changes in the unit value and volume of total exports of goods by main destination are shown in Table 1.

Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for importing alternative smoking products and importing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2026-02-12 16:15,2026-02-12 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200531.htm,"​An incoming female passenger was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and fined $500 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (February 12) for importing alternative smoking products, importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO) and the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted an incoming female passenger, aged 31, at Hong Kong International Airport on December 17, 2025, and seized about 20 000 alternative smoking products and about 17 800 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with a total estimated market value of about $134,100 and a duty potential of about $58,800, from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

衞生署提醒市民保持警惕預防傳染病和食物中毒　健康迎新歲,2026-02-12 16:00,2026-02-12 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200475.htm,"​農曆新年假期將至，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（二月十二日）提醒市民，不論留港或到外地度歲都要時刻注意個人、飲食及環境衞生，採取適當措施預防傳染病和食物中毒，亦應避免帶病出遊或參加聚會。

季節性流感及其他呼吸道傳染病
——————————————

本港流感活躍程度目前雖然處於低水平，但在不少港人外遊的熱門目的地，季節性流感活躍程度仍處於相對高水平，例如北美洲和歐洲部分地區，而韓國與日本的整體流感活動近日亦再度回升，當地的主要流行病毒從早前的甲型（H3）流感轉為乙型流感。市民外遊前應留意目的地的流感活躍情況。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「農曆新年跨境旅遊與訪港旅客增加，流感傳播的風險亦會上升。此外，根據過往經驗，香港冬季流感季節大多於第一季出現。天氣持續寒冷，而且流行的病毒株可能出現變化，不排除流感活躍程度稍後會再上升。接種季節性流感疫苗仍然是最有效預防季節性流感及其併發症的方法，亦可減低入院及死亡風險。市民無論留港度歲或計劃外遊，都應及早接種疫苗，因為接種疫苗後身體約需兩星期產生抗體，以對流感病毒提供足夠保護作用。所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗應盡早接種，包括在過去幾個月曾感染流感的人士，以保障個人健康。」

其他呼吸道傳染病方面，新冠病毒的整體活躍程度目前雖然維持在低水平，但新冠病毒一般每約六至九個月會經歷一次活躍周期，本港距離上一次新冠活躍周期的完結已超過七個月，香港在未來幾個月有機會出現另一次活躍周期。市民應適時接種新冠疫苗，以減低感染新冠病毒後重症和死亡的風險。現時在政府新冠疫苗接種計劃下，六個月大或以上人士可免費接種初始劑次，而高風險優先組別人士不論過往已接種多少劑疫苗，於接種上一劑疫苗或感染新冠病毒（以較後者為準）最少六個月後，均可免費接種加強劑。

此外，呼吸道合胞病毒在北美和歐洲多處地區的活躍程度亦維持在高水平。

要預防呼吸道傳染病，市民應時刻保持個人、手部和環境衞生。出現呼吸道感染病徵的市民，即使症狀輕微，都應佩戴外科口罩，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，並應盡早向醫生求診，而佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後要保持手部衞生。

急性腸胃炎、諾如病毒感染及食物中毒
—————————————————

徐樂堅醫生說：「近日與進食生蠔相關的諾如病毒食物中毒個案顯著上升，市民在新年聚餐時應提高警覺，避免進食生蠔或未徹底煮熟的雙殼類海產，尤其是孕婦、幼童、長者、免疫力弱人士及肝病患者。一般來說，諾如病毒在冬天（約十二月至三月期間）較為活躍。由於病毒具高度傳染性，受影響人士即使接觸少量病毒，亦有機會受感染。病毒可透過進食受污染的食物、接觸受感染人士的嘔吐物或排泄物，及接觸受污染的物件等不同途徑傳播，有機會導致大規模爆發。」

除了食物中毒，諾如病毒亦是引致急性腸胃炎的主要原因之一。鄰近地區的諾如病毒活躍程度亦持續上升，包括日本及韓國。韓國的諾如病毒活躍程度更超越過去幾年同期的水平。本地方面，急性腸胃炎爆發個案數字自本年一月初起有所上升，今年（截至二月十一日）已錄得40宗院舍和學校的急性腸胃炎爆發個案，涉306人。根據中心的傳染病定點監測數據，家庭醫學門診、私家醫生診所及幼兒中心／幼稚園的急性腸胃炎活躍程度近期亦呈上升趨勢。

徐樂堅醫生說：「要預防食物中毒，除了注意個人衞生，所有食物亦必須徹底清潔並煮熟後方可食用。市民在處理食物或進食前及如廁後，應用梘液和清水清潔雙手，搓手最少20秒，用水過清並用抹手紙或乾手機弄乾。由於酒精未能有效殺死諾如病毒，酒精搓手液不能代替使用梘液和清水潔手。」

蚊傳疾病
—————

本港今年暫時錄得六宗登革熱個案，全屬輸入個案，病人於潛伏期曾分別到過菲律賓、印度尼西亞、柬埔寨、阿拉伯聯合酋長國和越南。基孔肯雅熱方面，本港今年暫時錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均從塞舌爾輸入。

徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。要預防蚊傳疾病，市民應穿着寬鬆、淺色的長袖上衣及長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。如從受影響地區返港，應在至少14日內繼續使用昆蟲驅避劑。」

麻疹
——

北美洲（包括美國、加拿大及墨西哥）及東南亞地區（包括印尼、柬埔寨和菲律賓）近年因疫苗覆蓋接種率偏低，持續出現麻疹爆發，美國今年至今已錄得超過730宗個案，大幅高於去年同期。另外，日本的麻疹個案數字亦顯著上升，截至二月四日已錄得23宗個案，相比去年同期僅有一宗。新加坡和澳洲今年錄得的麻疹個案亦高於去年同期。海外大部分個案均未曾接種麻疹疫苗或疫苗接種史不詳，反映了維持整體高疫苗接種率及群體免疫力的重要性。

徐樂堅醫生說：「懷孕婦女及計劃懷孕婦女若對麻疹或風疹（德國麻疹）沒有免疫力，以及本港未滿一歲仍未適齡在『香港兒童免疫接種計劃』下接種麻疹、流行性腮腺炎及德國麻疹混合疫苗的兒童，不應前往爆發麻疹或風疹的目的地。麻疹的潛伏期為七至二十一日，病徵包括發燒、皮膚出現紅疹、咳嗽、流鼻水和眼紅等。市民如從麻疹流行地區回港後出現相關病徵，應戴上外科口罩，停止上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方和避免與未有免疫力人士接觸，尤其是抵抗力弱人士、孕婦及未滿一歲的兒童，並盡早向醫生求診。」

尼帕病毒感染
——————

尼帕病毒感染是一種新發的人畜共患疾病，病毒的天然宿主是果蝠，亦可影響多種動物，包括豬隻、馬、山羊、綿羊、貓和狗。根據世界衞生組織（世衞）的最新資料，近期印度西孟加拉邦的北24區縣及孟加拉國西北部拉傑沙希分別錄得兩宗及一宗尼帕病毒感染的確診個案。

世衞評估目前尼帕病毒在全球範圍內構成的公共衞生風險為低。雖然如此，若必須前往受尼帕病毒影響的地方時，應該避免接觸野生動物或染病的農場動物，尤其是蝙蝠、養殖豬、馬、家貓和野貓。另外，市民在食用水果前應徹底洗淨並去皮，切勿進食可能被蝙蝠咬過或從地上撿起的水果。避免飲用生的椰棗原汁、棕櫚汁或其他果汁。

中東呼吸綜合症
———————

中東呼吸綜合症的受影響地區主要為阿拉伯半島及其周邊國家，超過百分之八十五確診個案是由中東國家報告或由中東國家直接輸往其他國家。市民到中東地區外遊時，應避免到有單峰駱駝的農場、農莊或市場，及避免接觸病人及動物，特別是單峰駱駝，而營辦中東團的旅行社，不應安排旅客騎單峰駱駝或參與任何直接接觸單峰駱駝的活動。

徐樂堅醫生說：「市民外遊回港後，如出現發燒、呼吸道感染病徵、紅疹或腸胃不適，應盡快諮詢醫生，並告訴醫生最近曾到過的地方，以加快診治。中心會繼續監察本地及外地傳染病的情況，並適時向市民提供最新資訊，讓市民緊貼傳染病的發展並為預防措施做好準備。」

Customs officers intercepted a 60-year-old incoming male passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on February 10 and seized 201 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $820 and a duty potential of about $660, on his body. He was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Members of the public should not defy the law.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

阿拉伯聯合酋長國中央銀行（阿聯酋央行）與香港金融管理局（金管局）於二月十一日（阿布扎比時間）在阿布扎比舉行第三次會議。會議由阿聯酋央行行長H.E. Khaled Mohamed Balama和金管局總裁余偉文共同主持。此次會議是雙方持續努力加強兩地金融服務領域合作與互聯互通的一部分，體現雙方制度合作的深度及共同的監管願景。

建基於二○二四年十二月在香港舉行的第二次會議所取得的進展，阿聯酋央行與金管局就多個關鍵範疇進行深入討論。當中包括跨境債務資本市場互聯互通；數碼資產、代幣化和央行數碼貨幣發展；穩定幣監管框架的演進趨勢；以及供應鏈融資。

此次會議由雙方多位助理行長、副總裁以及高級官員共同出席，突顯了雙方致力於推動金融與技術合作以支持金融服務業可持續發展，並促進策略與運營層面機構協作的共同承諾。

繼第二次會議期間簽署諒解備忘錄，確立債務資本市場及相關金融市場基建互聯互通後，阿聯酋央行正式加入債務工具中央結算系統，即香港債務證券的核心託管平台。此舉讓阿聯酋央行及當地投資者得以充分利用香港成熟的金融基建，直接且具成本效益地進入中國內地資本市場及投資相關金融資產，這標誌着兩地深化互聯互通與金融融合的重要一步。

H.E. Khaled Mohamed Balama表示：「我們與香港金融管理局的合作體現了雙方加強跨境金融市場互聯互通和國際協作的共同承諾。加入債務工具中央結算系統使阿聯酋央行得以接觸亞洲資本市場，並與其他全球金融中心建立更深入聯繫，從而為阿聯酋市場參與者提供多元化的投資機會，並鞏固本國作為領先國際資本市場樞紐的角色。我們重視這一夥伴關係，並期待繼續合作以構建更具韌性、更緊密聯通的金融市場。」

余偉文表示：「很高興看到雙方的債務資本市場互聯互通取得實質性進展。我們歡迎阿聯酋央行成為債務工具中央結算系統的新成員，這彰顯了香港作為領先的離岸人民幣業務樞紐，以及國際投資者進入中國及亞洲市場首選門戶的地位。兩家央行的合作更體現了雙方在共同發展與創新方面的清晰願景。我們期待繼續與阿聯酋央行合作，推進在雙邊對話過程中討論的各項關鍵舉措。」"

The Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (CBUAE) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) convened their third meeting on February 11 (Abu Dhabi time) in Abu Dhabi, chaired by the Governor of the CBUAE, H.E. Khaled Mohamed Balama,and the Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue. The meeting comes as part of the ongoing joint efforts to further strengthen collaboration and connectivity between the financial services sectors of both jurisdictions, reflecting the depth of their institutional partnership and shared regulatory vision.

Building on the progress achieved from the second meeting held in Hong Kong in December 2024, the CBUAE and the HKMA conducted in-depth discussions covering several key areas. These included cross-border debt capital market connectivity; developments in digital assets, tokenisation, and central bank digital currency; as well as the development of regulatory frameworks for stablecoins; and supply chain financing.

The meeting was attended by Their Excellencies Assistant Governors and senior officials from both institutions, highlighting their shared commitment to advancing financial and technical co-operation to support the sector's sustainable development and to promote institutional co-ordination at the strategic and operational levels.

The CBUAE has formally joined the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU), Hong Kong's core central securities depository for debt securities, following the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding during the second meeting to establish debt capital market and the related financial market infrastructure connectivity. This provides the CBUAE and investors in the United Arab Emirates direct and cost-effective access to Chinese Mainland's capital markets and financial assets, leveraging Hong Kong's established financial infrastructure. It represents a major step forward in advancing market connectivity and deepening financial integration between the two regions.

H.E. Khaled Mohamed Balama said, ""Our collaboration with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority reflects a shared commitment to strengthening cross‑border financial market connectivity and international partnership.

位於赤柱海濱長廊的小賣亭屬食環署管理的公眾街市，前身為赤柱臨時街市。小賣亭由二○○七年開始營運，原設有20個攤檔，提供小食和乾濕貨。隨着營商環境轉變及其他因素影響，近年小賣亭租戶數目陸續減少，至今所有長期租戶均已遷出，現時攤檔以短期租約形式開放予有興趣人士經營。

食環署認為可以改變小賣亭的經營模式，引入單一營運者，透過優化座位空間、設置寵物友善休憩區，以及提供多元化的餐飲、零售及文化體驗，將該處打造成受市民和旅客歡迎的全新場地。署方期望透過是次邀請提交意向書的活動，了解市場是否有人士有興趣經營該場地，並歡迎他們就布局設計、攤檔組合及其他合適的營運模式等事宜提出具體建議。

食環署邀請市場在未來四個月向署方提交意向書，詳情可參閱食環署網頁。"
FEHD invites market to submit expressions of interest for future operation of Stanley Waterfront Mart,2026-02-12 12:00,2026-02-12 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200275.htm,"  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) invites the market to submit expressions of interest (EOIs) for the future operation of the Stanley Waterfront Mart today (February 12).

  Located along the Stanley Promenade, the Mart (formerly the Stanley Temporary Market) is a public market managed by the FEHD. Since commencing operation in 2007, the Mart originally housed 20 stalls offering light refreshment as well as dry and wet goods. Due to changes in the business environment and other factors, the number of tenants at the Mart has gradually decreased in recent years. At present, all long-term tenants have moved out, and the stalls are now open to interested parties for operation under short-term tenancies.

  The FEHD considers that the operating model of the Mart can be revamped by introducing a single operator management model. Through enhancing the communal seating area, setting up a pet-friendly resting area, and offering a diversified mix of dining, retail, and cultural experiences, the site can be transformed into a new venue welcomed by both the public and tourists. Through this EOI exercise, the FEHD aims to gauge whether there are parties in the market interested in operating the site and welcomes them to put forward concrete proposals on aspects such as layout design, stall mix, and other suitable operating models.

  The FEHD invites the market to submit EOIs within the coming four months. Further details are available on the FEHD website."

Interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements releases latest information on cross-boundary passenger traffic estimation and arrangements for Chinese New Year festive period,2026-02-12 10:35,2026-02-12 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021200209.htm,"  The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, released the following information today (February 12) on the latest situation and arrangements for the upcoming Chinese New Year festive.

  The Immigration Department (ImmD) estimates that around 11.38 million passengers (including Hong Kong residents and visitors) will pass through Hong Kong's sea, land and air control points during the upcoming Chinese New Year festive period (from February 14 to February 23). The ImmD, in consultation with the Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection and other Mainland authorities, estimates that around 9.52 million passengers will pass through land boundary control points. The number of outbound and inbound passengers using land boundary control points (BCPs) will be relatively higher on February 14 (Saturday) and February 22 (Sunday), with around 636 000 passengers and 663 000 passengers respectively.

  The ImmD estimates that the passenger traffic at the Lo Wu Control Point, the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point and the Shenzhen Bay Control Point will be heavy, with a daily average forecast of about 200 000, 187 000 and 156 000 passengers respectively.

  All BCPs will maintain the existing operating hours during this year's Chinese New Year holiday. The Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Port will maintain a 24-hour operation as usual.

  To cope with the anticipated heavy traffic during the festive period, the ImmD has minimised leave for frontline officers for flexible deployment, and operation of additional counters, temporary counters and channels. Additional security guards will also be deployed to provide crowd management support.

  Furthermore, the ImmD, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Customs and Excise Department and the MTR Corporation Limited will set up a joint command centre at the Lo Wu Control Point to make necessary arrangements. The ImmD will also establish close communication with Mainland authorities, including the Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection. To ensure a smooth passenger traffic flow, passenger conditions will be closely monitored and appropriate traffic diversion plans will be adopted when necessary.

  The ImmD advises all land boundary passengers to plan in advance, avoid making their journeys during busy periods and keep track of radio and TV broadcasts on traffic conditions at various control points. Residents and visitors may also visit ""Easy Boundary"" (www.sb.gov.hk/eng/bwt/status.html?type=outbound), a one-stop information platform on immigration clearance launched by the Security Bureau, to obtain useful information in one go, including the respective average waiting time for passengers and private cars at land BCPs, as well as for the HZMB cross-boundary shuttle bus (Gold Bus) and the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus), so as to plan their trips and save waiting time.

  For travellers making journeys to the Mainland, the ImmD reminds them to carry their proof of identity and valid travel documents for crossing the boundary. Hong Kong residents should also check the validity of their Home Visit Permits. Non-permanent residents must carry their valid smart identity card as well as their Document of Identity for Visa Purposes or valid travel document.

  Holders of the acknowledgement receipt issued due to reported loss or replacement of their Hong Kong identity cards, or children under 11 years old who hold Hong Kong identity cards, should carry a valid travel document or Re-entry Permit.

  About 700 e-Channels have been installed at various control points. To further enhance the clearance efficiency of control points, following the adjustment of the eligible age for using e-Channel service to seven or above for Hong Kong permanent residents, holders of Electronic Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao (e-EEP), holders of the People's Republic of China (PRC) electronic ordinary passports and departing visitors using ""Smart Departure"", the ImmD, in collaboration with the Public Security Police Force, the Identification Services Bureau and the Public Security Forces Affairs Bureau of Macao, with effect from January 19, has adjusted the eligible age for mutual use of automated immigration clearance services, and relaxed the requirements for the use of self-service enrolment kiosks for enrolment of such services. At present, Hong Kong residents aged 11 or above holding a valid Hong Kong permanent identity card are eligible for using the automated passenger clearance services in the Macao Special Administrative Region (Macao SAR) after enrolment. Under the new measure, Hong Kong residents agedseven to 10 holding a valid Hong Kong permanent identity card will also be eligible for using the automated passenger clearance services in the Macao SAR after enrolment. Similarly, Macao residents agedseven to 10 holding a valid Macao permanent identity card may use e-Channels to complete the automated immigration clearance after enrolment. Moreover, Hong Kong non-permanent residents aged 18 or above, holding a valid Hong Kong identity card and a valid Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Document of Identity for Visa Purposes with a validity of more than 90 days may perform the self-service enrolment for using the automated passenger clearance services in the Macao SAR at designated locations in Macao. Under the new measure, persons of this category may also perform the self-service enrolment at the enrolment kiosks installed at designated control points or at various Registration of Persons Offices in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Macao residents aged 18 or above holding a valid Macao non-permanent identity card and a valid visit permit for residents of Macao to the HKSAR may also perform the self-service enrolment for using e-Channel services at designated locations in the Macao SAR. For details of the e-Channel services, please visit:https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/immigration_clearance.html

  Hong Kong residents who require assistance while travelling outside Hong Kong may call the 24-hour hotline of the Assistance to Hong Kong Residents Unit of the ImmD at (852) 1868, call the 1868 hotline using network data or use the 1868 Chatbot via the ImmD Mobile App, send a message to 1868 WhatsApp assistance hotline or 1868 WeChat assistance hotline or submit the Online Assistance Request Form.

  The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements is tasked with holistically co-ordinating and steering the preparatory work of various government departments for welcoming visitors to Hong Kong during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland, as well as strengthening information dissemination to enable the public and visitors to plan their itineraries according to the latest situation."

今年農曆新年假期期間各口岸維持現行通關時間。落馬洲／皇崗口岸及港珠澳大橋口岸會如常24小時通關。

為疏導假期期間的旅客流量，入境處已減少前線人員休假，以便彈性調配人手，加開檢查櫃枱、臨時櫃枱及通道以疏導人流及車流。同時，入境處亦會增派保安人員協助維持旅客過關秩序。

另一方面，入境處亦會連同香港警務處、香港海關和香港鐵路有限公司在羅湖管制站成立聯合指揮中心，以作出相應的部署及採取適當措施，並與深圳邊檢總站等內地部門緊密聯繫，密切留意人流情況及在有需要時採取適當分流疏導措施，確保過關人流暢順。

入境處呼籲所有經陸路往返內地的旅客應預早計劃行程，盡量避免選擇在繁忙時段過關，並留意有關各邊境管制站交通情況的電台或電視廣播。市民及旅客亦可瀏覽保安局推出的一站式過關資訊平台「口岸通」（www.sb.gov.hk/chi/bwt/status.html?type=outbound），一次過取得各陸路邊境管制站旅客和私家車過關平均輪候時間，以及港珠澳大橋過境穿梭巴士（金巴）和落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）的平均輪候時間等有用資訊，以便計劃行程及減省等候時間。

入境處呼籲旅客在過關前往內地時，應緊記帶備身分證明文件及前往內地的有效旅行證件。香港居民出門前應檢查回鄉卡的有效日期，而香港非永久性居民則須帶同其有效的智能身份證及簽證身份書或旅行證件過關。

至於因遺失或補領身份證而獲發申請香港身份證收據的市民，或未滿十一歲而已領有香港身份證的兒童，他們應同時帶備有效的旅行證件或回港證過關。

現時入境處已在各管制站裝設約700條e-道。為進一步提升通關效率，繼調整香港永久性居民、電子往來港澳通行證持有人、中華人民共和國電子普通護照持有人及經「離境易」辦理手續的訪港旅客使用e-道服務的合資格年齡至七歲或以上後，入境處與澳門治安警察局、身份證明局及保安部隊事務局由一月十九日起調整互用自助出入境檢查服務的適用年齡，並放寬兩地使用自助登記服務機登記此服務的規定。現時，年滿十一歲或以上，並持有有效香港永久性居民身份證的香港居民，可在登記後使用澳門特別行政區（澳門特區）自助過關系統服務。在新措施下，年齡介乎七至十歲，並持有有效香港永久性居民身份證的香港居民，亦可在登記後使用澳門特區自助過關系統服務。同樣地，年齡介乎七至十歲，並持有有效澳門永久性居民身份證的澳門居民，可在登記後使用e-道自助辦理出入境手續。此外，年滿十八歲或以上，並持有有效的香港居民身份證及有效期多於九十天的香港特別行政區（香港特區）簽證身份書的香港非永久性居民，現時可在澳門指定地點登記澳門特區自助過關系統服務。在新措施下，此類人士亦可選擇使用設於香港指定管制站或各人事登記辦事處的自助登記服務機辦理登記。同時，年滿十八歲或以上持有有效澳門非永久性居民身份證及澳門居民往來香港特區旅遊證的澳門非永久性居民，亦可於澳門特區的指定地點使用自助辦證機登記e-道服務。有關e-道服務的詳情，請瀏覽：https://www.immd.gov.hk/hkt/services/immigration_clearance.html

S for S intends to make recommendation to CE-in-C on striking-off order against three companies relating to Apple Daily,2026-02-12 00:18,2026-02-12 00:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/12/P2026021101047.htm,"Following the Court of First Instance of the High Court's conviction and sentence of Apple Daily Limited, Apple Daily Printing Limited and AD Internet Limited (three companies relating to Apple Daily) for offences endangering national security, the Secretary for Security yesterday (February 11), pursuant to Article 31 of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and section 360C of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32), issued written notices to the three companies respectively, affording them an opportunity to make representations, before the Secretary for Security recommends the Chief Executive-in-Council (CE-in-C) to order the Registrar of Companies to strike the three companies off the Companies Register.

A spokesperson for the Security Bureau said, ""Lai Chee-ying and the three companies relating to Apple Daily were prosecuted with a total of three charges of offences endangering national security, including 'conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security' (contrary to Article 29 of the HKNSL and sections 159A and 159C of the Crimes Ordinance), and 'conspiracy to print, publish, sell, offer for sale, distribute, display and/or reproduce seditious publications' (contrary to sections 10, 159A and 159C of the Crimes Ordinance). The Court convicted Lai Chee-ying and the three defendant companies of all charges on December 15, 2025 and handed down sentences on February 9 this year. Amongst others, the three companies relating to Apple Daily were each sentenced to a fine of HK$3,004,500.

""The Court pointed out in its Reasons for Verdict that Lai Chee-ying closely managed and exercised hands-on control on the editorial direction of Apple Daily. Whether pre- or post- HKNSL, Lai Chee-ying utilised Apple Daily's platform to publish seditious articles, and requested foreign countries to impose sanctions or blockades or engage in other hostile activities against the People's Republic of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). The senior management of Apple Daily were fully aware of Lai Chee-ying's intention and provided support by executing his editorial directions. The conspiracies in the charges were facilitated by the three companies relating to Apple Daily, and they were knowing and willing parties to the conspiracies. The Court also held in its Reasons for Sentence that the offence of 'conspiracy to print, publish, sell, offer for sale, distribute, display and/or reproduce seditious publications' in this case fell within the most serious category for its type, and the two offences of 'conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security' fell within the category of offences of 'a grave nature'.""

""Article 31 of the HKNSL stipulates that the operation of an incorporated or unincorporated body such as a company or an organization shall be suspended or its licence or business permit shall be revoked if the body has been punished for committing an offence under that law. The HKSAR Government has a responsibility to enforce the relevant provisions in Article 31 of the HKNSL regarding the three companies relating to Apple Daily.""

""Taking into account the relevant circumstances of the case, including the conviction and seriousness of the offences committed by the three companies relating to Apple Daily, the Secretary for Security now considers that it is necessary for safeguarding national security to prohibit the operation or continued operation of these three companies in Hong Kong, and therefore intends to make a recommendation to the CE-in-C to consider exercising the power under section 360C of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32) to order the Registrar of Companies to strike the three companies relating to Apple Daily off the Companies Register.""

""The Secretary for Security has issued written notices to the three relevant companies respectively, affording them an opportunity to make written representations by February 25. When the Secretary for Security makes the relevant recommendation to the CE-in-C, the written representations submitted by the three relevant companies (if any) will be submitted together to the CE-in-C for a decision whether or not to make the order.""

""If the CE-in-C eventually decides to order the Registrar of Companies to strike the three companies relating to Apple Daily off the Companies Register, the three companies will become 'prohibited organizations'. Any person who engages in the acts specified in sections 62 to 65 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) commits an offence, including acting as an office-bearer or a member of a prohibited organization and giving aids of any kind to a prohibited organization, and is liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $1,000,000 and imprisonment for 14 years.""

The spokesperson pointed out, ""The HKSAR Government steadfastly safeguards the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people as protected under the law. Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, human rights in the city have always been robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. The HKNSL and the SNSO also clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and that the rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, shall be protected in accordance with the law. Nonetheless, just as the case with other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. The ICCPR also expressly states that some of them may be subject to restrictions as prescribed by law that are necessary for the protection of national security, public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms of others, etc.""

The spokesperson stressed, ""Safeguarding national security is a matter of fundamental importance. Endangering national security is a very serious offence. Such acts or activities may lead to extremely grave consequences. The Government of the HKSAR will, as always, resolutely, fully, and faithfully implement the HKNSL, the SNSO, and other relevant laws of the HKSAR for safeguarding national security to effectively prevent, suppress, and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law, and prohibit the operation of organizations that engage in activities endangering national security in the HKSAR."""
