  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on December 2 to noon today (December 3), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 218 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  On November 1, 2014, the Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) decided to designate December 4 of each year as Constitution Day and conduct promotion of and education activities on the Constitution through multiple channels to heighten public awareness of the Constitution, promote the spirit of and enhance the implementation of the Constitution, and advance the overall law-based governance of the country.

  The Preamble of the Constitution clearly stipulates that ""realising the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"" is a fundamental task for our country. Fully implementing the Constitution is the primary task and foundational work for advancing the country's overall law-based governance and building a socialist state under the rule of law, and has laid a solid foundation for developing socialist modernisation and realising the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. This year's seminar will be conducted on the theme of ""The Constitution and the Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation"". The seminar will feature a keynote speech and a panel discussion. The keynote speech will be delivered by member of the HKSAR Basic Law Committee under the Standing Committee of the NPC, and Professor of the Renmin Law School, Renmin University of China Professor Han Dayuan.

Speech by SJ at Symposium of HCCH Regional Office for Asia and Pacific on Private International Law (English only) (with photo),2025-12-03 11:33,2025-12-03 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300305.htm,"Following are the welcome remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the Symposium of the HCCH Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (ROAP) on Private International Law under Hong Kong Legal Week 2025 today (December 3):

Dr Christophe Bernasconi (Secretary-General of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH)), Consuls-General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

I am honoured to join you all today at the Symposium of the HCCH Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific on Private International Law, co-organised by the Hague Conference on Private International Law and the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy of my department, as part of the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025.

In fact, this is the very first time that we co-organised an event with the HCCH during Hong Kong Legal Week. The HCCH is our long-standing partner and we have worked very closely with the HCCH for decades. With the staunch support of the Central People's Government, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has been actively participating in the working groups, meetings and activities of the HCCH as part of the Chinese delegation since 1997. Through a standing arrangement with the HCCH, Hong Kong legal talent from both the private and public sectors have the opportunity to be seconded to the Permanent Bureau of the HCCH at the Hague, obtaining valuable insights into the work of the HCCH in the field of private international law.

In 2012, the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific of the HCCH was set up in the HKSAR. Since its establishment, ROAP has played a significant role in increasing awareness and understanding of the importance of the HCCH and its instruments among states and stakeholders, as well as contributing to the smooth implementation and operation of the HCCH's instruments in the Asia-Pacific region.

Today’s Symposium is another example of our long-standing collaborations with the HCCH. We are joined here today by esteemed speakers from different parts of the Asia-Pacific region, who will share their insightful views on topics relevant to the theme of today's Symposium - ""Transnational Litigation & Apostille: Innovating Practices under the HCCH Conventions"".

Hong Kong has long valued the work of the HCCH; a total of nine HCCH instruments are currently applicable to the HKSAR, including the Apostille, Service and Evidence Conventions, which will be discussed in today's Symposium. Back in 1965, the first HCCH Convention which applied to Hong Kong was the Apostille Convention, which is now one of the most widely applied multilateral treaties in the area of legal co-operation with over 125 contracting parties, followed by the Service Convention in 1970 and the Evidence Convention in 1978. Under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", these HCCH Conventions continue to apply to the HKSAR since 1997.

As the timing would suggest, these HCCH Conventions were concluded at a time which is vastly different from today. To adapt to the rapid and ever-evolving technological advancements over the years, the HCCH has developed various innovating practices to facilitate and streamline the functioning of the HCCH's Conventions in this digital age.

These innovating practices include the electronic Apostille Programme (e-APP), which is aimed at supporting the electronic issuance and verification of Apostilles around the world. The HKSAR has also implemented the e-APP in recent years, which will be discussed by Registrar Kwang from the High Court of the HKSAR (Registrar of the High Court, Mr Simon Kwang) during the first panel discussion later today. With respect to the use of digital means under other HCCH Conventions, taking of evidence by video link has been implemented in the HKSAR for some years. In fact, video-conferencing facilities have been used for remote hearings for suitable civil cases of the High Court since April 3, 2020. I will leave further discussion to our experts at the second panel who will share their insights on how digital means could further enhance efficiency in litigation support under various HCCH Conventions.

Ladies and gentlemen, today's theme is timely as we explore how innovating practices, including digital means, can streamline cross-border document circulation and enhance efficiency in litigation support in the context of the HCCH's Conventions. I hope today's Symposium will allow us all to engage in meaningful exchanges and drive forward the future of private international law. Thank you."

Through a standing arrangement with the HCCH, Hong Kong legal talent from both the private and public sectors have the opportunity to be seconded to the Permanent Bureau of the HCCH at the Hague, obtaining valuable insights into the work of the HCCH in the field of private international law.

In 2012, the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific of the HCCH was set up in the HKSAR. Since its establishment, ROAP has played a significant role in increasing awareness and understanding of the importance of the HCCH and its instruments among states and stakeholders, as well as contributing to the smooth implementation and operation of the HCCH's instruments in the Asia-Pacific region.

Today’s Symposium is another example of our long-standing collaborations with the HCCH. We are joined here today by esteemed speakers from different parts of the Asia-Pacific region, who will share their insightful views on topics relevant to the theme of today's Symposium - ""Transnational Litigation & Apostille: Innovating Practices under the HCCH Conventions"".

Hong Kong has long valued the work of the HCCH; a total of nine HCCH instruments are currently applicable to the HKSAR, including the Apostille, Service and Evidence Conventions, which will be discussed in today's Symposium. Back in 1965, the first HCCH Convention which applied to Hong Kong was the Apostille Convention, which is now one of the most widely applied multilateral treaties in the area of legal co-operation with over 125 contracting parties, followed by the Service Convention in 1970 and the Evidence Convention in 1978. Under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", these HCCH Conventions continue to apply to the HKSAR since 1997.

As the timing would suggest, these HCCH Conventions were concluded at a time which is vastly different from today. To adapt to the rapid and ever-evolving technological advancements over the years, the HCCH has developed various innovating practices to facilitate and streamline the functioning of the HCCH's Conventions in this digital age.

These innovating practices include the electronic Apostille Programme (e-APP), which is aimed at supporting the electronic issuance and verification of Apostilles around the world. The HKSAR has also implemented the e-APP in recent years, which will be discussed by Registrar Kwang from the High Court of the HKSAR (Registrar of the High Court, Mr Simon Kwang) during the first panel discussion later today. With respect to the use of digital means under other HCCH Conventions, taking of evidence by video link has been implemented in the HKSAR for some years. In fact, video-conferencing facilities have been used for remote hearings for suitable civil cases of the High Court since April 3, 2020. I will leave further discussion to our experts at the second panel who will share their insights on how digital means could further enhance efficiency in litigation support under various HCCH Conventions.

Ladies and gentlemen, today's theme is timely as we explore how innovating practices, including digital means, can streamline cross-border document circulation and enhance efficiency in litigation support in the context of the HCCH's Conventions. I hope today's Symposium will allow us all to engage in meaningful exchanges and drive forward the future of private international law. Thank you."

Speech by SFST at Insurtech Insights Asia 2025 (English only),2025-12-03 10:59,2025-12-03 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300262.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the Insurtech Insights Asia 2025 today (December 3):

Kristoffer (CEO of Insurtech Insights, Mr Kristoffer Lundberg), distinguished guests, industry leaders, ladies and gentlemen,

  Welcome again to Hong Kong, and it is a privilege of mine to address all of you today at Insurtech Insights Asia 2025. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the organisers for convening this gathering of innovators who are redefining the boundaries of insurance through technology. This gathering is far more than an event; it is a powerful catalyst for collaboration, imagination, and the bold ideas that will shape the future of risk management across Asia and beyond.

  Hong Kong has long been recognised as one of the world's premier international financial centres. Our strategic position at the heart of Asia, our robust legal system, our deep pool of global talent, and our unwavering commitment to market development have together created a uniquely fertile ecosystem for the insurance sector.

  Today, we host 160 authorised insurers incorporated in Hong Kong, the Mainland, and overseas countries. Six of them are indeed among the world's top 10 insurance groups. Last year, total gross premiums surpassed HK$637 billion, while the industry contributed 3.5 per cent to our GDP (Gross Domestic Product). More tellingly, Hong Kong recorded the highest insurance density in Asia and the second highest globally at over US$8,700 per capita, and an insurance penetration rate of 18.2 per cent - the highest in the world. These are not mere statistics or numbers; they are proof of the trust that individuals, families, and enterprises place in Hong Kong as their preferred centre for managing risk.

  Yet we are not content to rest on these achievements. Under the National 14th Five-Year Plan, the Central Government has endorsed Hong Kong's development as a risk management hub. We are determined to fulfil our role as the ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"" - a two-way springboard that propels Mainland enterprises onto the global stage while inviting international players like all of you to seize the vast opportunities of our nation and the region.

  Technology - particularly insurtech - is the engine that will accelerate this vision. Artificial intelligence, digital distribution, open ecosystems, and resilient cyber infrastructure are no longer optional enhancements; they are fundamental to building an insurance sector that is smarter, faster, more inclusive, and more responsive to the needs of a new generation.

  Earlier this year, our Insurance Authority, whose Chairman and CEO are both here today, completed a survey on AI adoption across our industry. The findings are both encouraging and instructive. Twenty per cent of insurers have already formulated formal AI strategies and are actively implementing solutions. Over half of them are in exploratory or pilot phases, while 40 per cent plan to increase investment over the next two years. Larger insurers are leading deployment, medium-sized firms are formulating strategies, and smaller players are carefully assessing pathways forward. Indeed, generative AI is already transforming customer communication through intelligent chatbots, accelerating information retrieval, and streamlining claims management. Encouragingly, we see a clear shift: from purely internal process optimisation towards powerful customer-facing applications and distribution support.

  These developments, however, also highlight challenges that we must tackle collectively: the availability of skilled AI talent, data quality and availability, budget constraints, regulatory compliance, and the integration of new systems with legacy infrastructure. In response, our Insurance Authority is pursuing a balanced, two-pronged strategy that provides regulatory clarity while actively nurturing innovation.

  On the regulatory front, we will soon issue updated supervisory guidance on the use of AI, ensuring that innovation is always accompanied by fairness, accountability, transparency, and also robust policyholder protection. Industry consultation on the revised guidance will commence by early next year.

  On the development front, I am delighted to highlight the launch in August of the AI Cohort Programme. Seven leading insurers have pledged as core participants, committing to establish an AI Centre of Excellence right here in Hong Kong - a regional hub that will drive innovation, nurture talent through structured capability-building initiatives, and foster knowledge-sharing across the industry and with regulators. The programme provides shared resources, regulatory-compliant testing environments, and matchmaking between insurers and cutting-edge technology providers like all of you. Regular seminars and case-sharing sessions will disseminate best practices and accelerate adoption. Indeed, a core participant will sign a Memorandum of Understanding with Cyberport to leverage its supercomputing resources and AI ecosystem for collaborative proof-of-concept projects in areas such as fraud detection, claims automation, and personalised customer engagement.

  This spirit of experimentation is further embodied in our insurtech-enabling initiatives. Since introducing the Fast Track for virtual insurers, the Insurance Authority has authorised four digital insurers - two in life and two in non-life business. These virtual insurers have been growing in terms of in-force policies and revenue premiums, demonstrating that fully digital models can indeed scale rapidly while maintaining the highest standards of consumer protection.

  The Insurtech Sandbox has also been a resounding success. As of March this year, 43 applications have been approved - many involving remote video onboarding, intermediary-free digital sales of life products, and streamlined application processes. These controlled experiments allow us to test bold ideas in a safe environment, gather real-world evidence, and refine regulation in step with innovation.

  We are equally committed to open ecosystems. The Insurance Authority is working closely with the industry on more than 30 Open API (Application Programming Interfaces) use cases spanning the entire insurance value chain. By fostering interoperability, we are laying the foundation for a truly connected insurance marketplace that benefits consumers and distributors alike.

  In an increasingly digital world, cyber resilience is non-negotiable. In January this year, our Insurance Authority introduced the revamped Guideline on Cybersecurity and the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework (C-RAF). This framework empowers insurers to assess their own risk exposure and control maturity and to develop targeted remediation plans. It represents a mature, forward-looking approach that keeps pace with evolving threats while preserving flexibility for institutions of different sizes and sophistication.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the initiatives I just said, including AI guidance and the Cohort Programme, virtual insurers, sandbox, Open API, and cyber resilience, are not just isolated measures. Together, they form a coherent, future-oriented framework that positions Hong Kong as Asia's insurtech capital.

  And we are backing this framework with concrete policy support across the broader risk management landscape: the extended Pilot Insurance-linked Securities Grant Scheme, the new risk-based capital regime, the forthcoming review of infrastructure investment capital charges, the newly established commercial marine specialty risk pool, and our continuing efforts to attract captive insurers and international players to our market.

  Hong Kong always stands ready. We offer the deepest insurance market in Asia, a regulatory regime that is both rigorous and responsive, a vibrant technology ecosystem, and an unshakeable commitment to innovation with integrity.

  Let us seize this moment together. Let us harness insurtech to create an insurance industry that is not only more efficient, but also more inclusive, more sustainable, and more capable of protecting the aspirations of customers across our nation and our region. In recent days, our community has been reminded of the profound importance of this mission through a very tragic fire incident, a heartbreaking event that has touched us all. The swift and compassionate response from our insurance sector - facilitating claims processes with efficiency and empathy - has provided vital support to those affected, underscoring the sector's enduring role as a pillar of societal resilience. We stand in solidarity with the families and communities impacted, drawing strength from our shared commitment to safeguard one another in times of adversity like this. I encourage our industry to continue this noble tradition of service, innovating not just for growth, but to fortify the bonds of trust and security that define a caring society. Thank you very much. I wish Insurtech Insights Asia 2025 every success and very much look forward to the ideas shared by Kristoffer and more insights that will emerge from the discussions today. Thank you."

His Excellency Massimo Ambrosetti (Ambassador of Italy to the People's Republic of China), Mr Joseph Lo (Chairman of the Hong Kong Design Centre), Ms Sophia Chong (Executive Director of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning.

I would like to extend a warm welcome to all of you especially those of you who have travelled near and far to join us at the grand opening of this year's Business of Design Week (BODW). While I come here with a heavy heart following the recent fire in Tai Po, it gives me much comfort to see that Hong Kong does not face its challenges alone. Thank you for being here today – while our city continues to grieve and bravely confront the aftermath of the fire. Your presence is a meaningful gesture of the support indeed.

Debuting in 2002, the BODW is Hong Kong's flagship annual design event. It has been sponsored for many years by the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency and its predecessor, CreateHK. In the last two decades, it has grown into a globally acclaimed platform that fosters international exchange and business collaboration. True to its legacy, this year's edition offers a series of thought-provoking programmes, centred around the theme ""Curiosity Ignites Design Innovation"" – reflecting how curiosity fuels creativity across arts, architecture, and manufacturing.

Over the next three days, more than 50 world renowned creative and business leaders will share insights on how curiosity drives creativity and paves the way toward a more sustainable and inclusive future. Masters from various design disciplines will guide us on a journey to rediscover how good design enhances our quality of life – and reimagine how it can help shape a better tomorrow.

This year, we have the privilege to welcome Italy once again as our partner country, building on our successful collaborations in 2007 and 2017. As 2025 also marks the 55th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and Italy, this reunion at the BODW is both timely and meaningful. It also reaffirms Hong Kong's role as an East meets‍ West centre for international cultural exchange.

I would like to thank the Hong Kong Design Centre for delivering yet another outstanding BODW programme – one that strengthens Hong Kong's standing as a global design hub. Italy, a country globally celebrated for its design, aesthetics and creativity, will continue to inspire us as we reinforce our role as the creative capital of Asia.

Before I close, I would once again like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you for your friendship and for the care you have shown Hong Kong. May you enjoy an inspiring and rewarding creative journey throughout this year's BODW. Thank you."

Government announces updates on Task Forces' follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-02 23:33,2025-12-02 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200910.htm,"  In view of the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po that resulted in multiple casualties, the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, today (December 2) announced that an independent committee to be led by a judge will be established to conduct a comprehensive review to examine the cause of the fire and related issues, in order to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.

  Meanwhile, the Government continues to make full efforts in following up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the fire. The latest progress made by various bureaux and departments under the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fundraising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation - led respectively by the Chief Secretary for Administration, the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, and the Deputy Financial Secretary - is as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

  For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po established by the Government, as of noon today, the donations received have reached $2 billion. In addition to the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has reached around $2.3 billion. The fund will be used to assist the residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support. The Government earlier announced that the Support Fund will provide the families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 21 cases have been processed, and disbursements are underway. In addition, the Government also announced that the Support Fund will provide a living allowance of $50,000 to each affected household. As of today, 104 cases have been processed, and disbursements are also underway.

  To provide immediate relief for affected residents, the Government has been offering an emergency subsidy of $10,000 per affected household since the evening of November 27. As of 4pm today, the Government had registered more than 1 930 households for the subsidy, with disbursements made to 1 916 households.

  Social workers of the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 500 affected households so far for registration of the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. The SWD also deployed social workers and clinical psychologists to accompany families in attending vigils at the scene today and provided them with emotional support. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households for provision of all necessary assistance while fully backing the support and relief work of the Government. Those not yet in touch with the SWD are advised to leave their contact information by calling 182 183 as soon as possible.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

  As of this morning (December 2), 1 013 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps or hotel rooms. Another 1 607 residents have moved into transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units of the Hong Kong Housing Society. In addition, the Tai Po District Office continues to operate a temporary shelter at Tai Po Community Centre, which remains open to residents in need. As for the other temporary shelter at the Tung Cheong Street Community Hall, it will no longer accept new users but will remain in operation until the existing users have relocated to the arranged emergency accommodation.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform (www.taipodonation.hk) established by the Government and the information technology sector began operation on November 30 to facilitate registration of supplies donations from organisations and members of the public. Together with the information provided by members of the public via WhatsApp earlier, the Government has so far received over 860 registrations with different kinds of donation items including food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, beddings and electrical appliances. The Government will consolidate information of all donation items and distribute supplies to residents in need as necessary.

Funeral services
------------------

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has arranged dedicated staff for each family of the deceased to assist them in making funeral arrangements at their preferred time and location. The FEHD has set up a service counter at the Fu Shan Public Mortuary and will proactively contact the families through the social workers of the SWD. Once the families have made decisions, the FEHD will follow up on the relevant arrangements promptly. The FEHD also maintains close liaison with the funeral trade to provide necessary assistance to the families.

   Besides, the Government will waive fees for columbarium and related services, and will provide $50,000 to the families of each deceased individual through the ""one social worker per household"" service to cover funeral and related expenses.

Education support
--------------------

  The school premises of Tai Po Baptist Public School (TPBPS) will remain closed for a certain period of time due to the fire. In order to facilitate early resumption of the normal teaching routine of TPBPS and provide proper care for the students, the Education Bureau (EDB) has co-ordinated with schools in Tai Po District to deploy available classrooms and has arranged for TPBPS students to attend classes by grade level at the school premises of Tai Po Government Primary School and N.T.W.J.W.A Christian Remembrance of Grace Primary School from the middle of this month. The EDB has set up a working group dedicated to implementing the above arrangements. The Government will earmark $5 million to support the operations of the above schools during the transition period and provide appropriate learning and teaching assistance for students and teachers.

Handling of reported missing persons
------------------------------------------

  The Police have earlier completed searches at five buildings and started searching the remaining two most affected buildings yesterday (December 1). Today, 330 officers from the Disaster Victim Identification Unit (DVIU) were deployed to continue the search. The Fire Services Department (FSD) personnel are also supporting the DVIU by forcing open doors at the scene and providing relevant information. As of 4pm today, the Police handled 13 sets of human remains in the buildings, including five sets of newly found and eight sets found by firefighters but yet to be removed. The number of the deceased has been updated to 156. The Police will continue to follow up on the reported missing persons, aiming to confirm their status and the number of casualties as soon as possible.

  The forensic pathologists from the Department of Health continued to assist personnel from the DVIU on-site in collecting evidence, making every effort to help identify the deceased. As of 4pm today, the next of kin of 116 victims have completed necessary procedures at the Fu Shan Public Mortuary.

Investigations
-----------------

  The FSD continues to take photos and gather evidence at the fire scene, and is discussing with the Lands Department to create a 3D model to assist the investigation.

  The Police have so far arrested a total of 15 people on suspicion of manslaughter, including two individuals from a construction company arrested last night, and 13 individuals from various construction companies arrested earlier. The Police have accorded top priority to the case and are gathering evidence through various channels for a thorough and in-depth investigation. The possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

Regulation and inspection work
-----------------------------------

  The Independent Checking Unit (ICU) of the Housing Bureau conducted a meeting with structural engineering experts and professionals from the Housing Department (HD) today to study the structure of the buildings in Wang Fuk Court in detail and formulate an action plan for the extraction of concrete cores samples for detailed analysis. Additionally, firefighters are assisting the HD with temporary reinforcement work for 13 units in Wang Cheong Court.

  The ICU today contacted representatives of Sui Wo Court, Ching Lai Court, Yee Kok Court and On Kay Court once again and noted that the registered contractors have proactively started dismantling the protective nets in the respective housing courts. The ICU will continue to monitor the situation. For Wang Chi House, the contractor of the HD will remove the plastic sheeting on the external walls as well as the protective nets after departments, including the FSD and the Labour Department (LD) have completed collecting evidence on-site.

  Relevant departments continued the special inspections of existing buildings undergoing major external wall maintenance, and took samples for testing from buildings installed with scaffold nets. As of today, the Buildings Department (BD) has taken samples from 352 private buildings and sent them for testing in batches. The Architectural Services Department has also inspected all 18 of its public works building projects and collected samples for testing. In order to enhance the accuracy of whether the relevant materials meet the fire-retardant requirements, the departments are adopting rigorous and extensive sampling methods, taking samples from different parts of the external walls of buildings. Due to the large sample size (with thousands of samples being drawn), it will take considerable time to conduct the sampling and testing, and all parties will strive to complete this as soon as possible. Apart from the two buildings where plastic sheeting was found blocking the windows as announced earlier (removed already in accordance with the Government's instructions), the BD did not find other buildings that used foam boards or plastic sheeting to block windows.

  The LD launched a territory-wide special enforcement operation on November 28, targeting the fire protection facilities and fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding erected. This includes checking if protective screens (also known as scaffold nets) on scaffolds are in compliance with recognised standards for fire-retardant materials to safeguard the occupational safety of workers. As of 4pm today, the LD has inspected 110 construction sites, issued a total of 70 written warnings and 46 improvement notices, and has taken out 11 prosecutions."

The forums will take place on two consecutive days, tomorrow and the day after (December 3 and 4), with four forums each day.

Polling stations

In view of the fire in Tai Po, the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) will make new arrangements for three polling stations in the district. The arrangements will mainly affect voters of Wang Fuk Court, Kwong Fuk Estate, Tai Po Kau and Tai Po Hui. For details, please refer to the press releaseissued separately by the REO today.

Election Fun Day, free admission to facilities and offers

In light of the latest blaze situation, the Government will not hold the Election Fun Day on December 6. Only informative activities will be kept, i.e. ""Election and Me"" roving exhibition to be held at Plaza Hollywood in Diamond Hill. Other carnivals, fun days as well as variety show will be cancelled.

FEHD and Hong Kong Customs continue to inspect premises selling hairy crabs in various districts (with photos),2025-12-02 20:57,2025-12-02 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200721.htm,"To safeguard food safety, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and Hong Kong Customs conducted joint blitz operations in late November to inspect selling points of hairy crabs across various districts, following a similar joint operation in October. The inspections aimed to ensure that hairy crabs on sale in the market comply with relevant requirements under the laws. The FEHD and Customs also stepped up joint enforcement actions at boundary control points against suspected parallel traders bringing hairy crabs into Hong Kong for selling purpose.

A spokesman for the FEHD said today (December 2), ""During the joint blitz inspections of selling points of hairy crabs, officers from the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch of the FEHD and Customs officers have inspected 50 premises selling hairy crabs. The source documents and health certificates of the hairy crabs were checked to ensure that the hairy crabs sold at the premises are in compliance with the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132) as well as the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (TDO) (Cap. 362) and are fit for human consumption. The FEHD and Customs officers also distributed promotional leaflets to the operators of the premises, reminding them to pay attention to food safety and comply with relevant requirements under the laws. During the operations, no contravention was found.""

The CFS has maintained close liaison with Customs to strengthen joint enforcement actions at boundary control points, targeting suspected parallel traders carrying hairy crabs into Hong Kong for selling purpose. Over the past six weeks, the CFS received 16 suspected cases referred by Customs, intercepted over 1 900 hairy crabs. Upon referral, the CFS immediately started follow-up investigations into the source of the crabs, whether health certificates were provided, the intended use of the crabs brought into Hong Kong, and whether the persons involved were registered as importers under the Food Safety Ordinance (Cap. 612). Follow-up actions are ongoing.

At the retail level, the FEHD also conducted blitz inspections over the past three weeks. Prosecutions were initiated against two public market stalls for selling hairy crabs without permission. The FEHD also found six online platforms holding online sale of restricted food permits that failed to display permit details on their websites as required. Verbal warnings were issued, and subsequent re-inspections confirmed compliance. The FEHD will continue monitoring and take appropriate actions.

According to the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132), all food available for sale in Hong Kong, locally produced or imported, should be fit for human consumption. An offender in this regard is subject to a maximum fine of $50,000 and imprisonment for six months upon conviction. Under the Food Safety Ordinance (Cap. 612), any person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with the record-keeping requirement relating to movement of food commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for three months upon conviction.

Under the Food Business Regulation (Cap. 132X) (the Regulation), save with the written permission of the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene (DFEH), no person shall sell any restricted foods, including shellfish. Operators selling hairy crabs shall obtain the Shell Fish (Hairy Crab) Permit or relevant written permission granted by the FEHD; or, if the shop already holds another relevant FEHD licence (such as a fresh provision shop licence) or operates a fish stall in a market managed by the FEHD, the operator must apply for written permission. Premises holding a permit or licence must, in accordance with the law, display the permit or licence prominently. If the operator sells only through online platforms, they must apply for an online sale of restricted food permit. The website or online platform account homepage selling hairy crabs must clearly display the permit information, such as the permit number, registered address, and the types of restricted foods approved for sale. The relevant regulatory condition also stipulates that hairy crabs for sale shall be obtained from a reliable and reputable source. A copy of the health certificate issued by the relevant authority and acceptable to the DFEH shall also be kept. Under the Regulation, any person who operates an unlicensed food business or sells restricted foods without permission commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and imprisonment for six months upon conviction.

Customs reminds traders not to apply a false trade description to goods or services, or to supply or offer to supply goods or services to which a false trade description is applied. Those who violate the TDO are liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years. Customs also attaches great importance to the protection of consumer rights and will take appropriate enforcement action once activities in violation of the TDO are detected in the market.

The FEHD and Customs remind the trade not to import or put on sale hairy crabs or other food with an unknown origin, and consumers should make purchases at reputable shops with the Shell Fish (Hairy Crab) Permit or relevant written permission granted by the FEHD.

If members of the public suspect that there are operators selling hairy crabs without the relevant permits/permissions or the hairy crabs are not accompanied with health certificates, they may make a report by calling the FEHD hotline at 2868 0000 or through email (enquiries@fehd.gov.hk).

In addition, members of the public may make a report to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/) for suspected violations of the TDO."
食環署與香港海關繼續巡查各區大閘蟹銷售處所（附圖）,2025-12-02 20:57,2025-12-02 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200664.htm,"為保障食物安全，食物環境衞生署（食環署）與香港海關繼十月的聯合行動後，於十一月下旬聯合突擊巡查各區大閘蟹銷售處所，確保市面出售的大閘蟹符合相關法例規定，並針對懷疑水貨客攜帶大閘蟹入境作買賣用途的情況，於各個邊境管制站加強聯合執法行動。

食環署發言人今日（十二月二日）表示：「在聯合突擊巡查大閘蟹銷售處所的行動期間，食環署食物安全中心（食安中心）和環境衞生部連同海關人員共巡查了50個大閘蟹銷售處所，查核大閘蟹的來源文件和衞生證明書，確保有關處所出售的大閘蟹符合《公眾衞生及市政條例》（第132章）和《商品說明條例》（第362章）的規定，並適宜供人食用。食環署和海關人員亦向各處所負責人派發宣傳單張，提醒他們注意食物安全及遵從相關法例規定。突擊巡查行動中未有發現違規情況。」

食環署食安中心亦一直與海關保持緊密聯繫，於各個邊境管制站加強聯合執法行動，以打擊懷疑水貨客攜帶大閘蟹入境作銷售用途，以確保市面上出售的食物符合法例規定及要求。在過去六星期，食安中心共接獲16宗由香港海關轉介的懷疑水貨客攜帶大閘蟹入境個案，截獲超過1 900隻大閘蟹。接獲海關轉介後，食安中心已即時展開跟進調查，就大閘蟹的來源、有否附有相關衞生證明書、攜帶大閘蟹入境的用途及有否根據《食物安全條例》（第612章）登記成為進口商等方向查問涉案人士，跟進工作仍然繼續。

在零售層面上，食環署在過去三星期亦作出突擊巡查，並就兩個公眾街市攤檔在未有獲得准許出售大閘蟹的違例情況，向有關檔主提出檢控。署方亦發現持有六個已獲署方簽發網上銷售限制出售食物許可證的網上平台，沒有按持證條件在其網上平台展示許可證的資料，因此向有關持證人發出口頭警告。署方其後的複查確定上述持證人已遵從相關持證條件。食環署會繼續留意有關情況並採取適當行動。

根據《公眾衞生及市政條例》（第132章），所有在香港出售的食物，不論本地生產或進口，必須適宜供人食用，違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁六個月。而根據《食物安全條例》（第612章），任何人如無合理辯解而沒有遵從備存食物進出紀錄的規定，即屬違法，最高可被判罰款一萬元及監禁三個月。

根據《食物業規例》（第132X章），除非獲得食環署署長書面准許，任何人不可售賣限制出售的食物，包括介貝類水產動物。銷售大閘蟹的店鋪須領有食環署簽發的介貝類水產動物（大閘蟹）售賣許可證；或如店鋪已領有食環署的其他相關牌照（如新鮮糧食店牌照）或屬食環署管理的街市魚類攤檔，經營者則須申請書面准許。已領有許可證或牌照的處所，須按法例要求在當眼處展示該許可證或牌照。如經營者只透過網上平台銷售，則須申領「網上受限制食物售賣許可證」。售賣大閘蟹的網站或網上平台帳戶主頁，須清楚展示許可證資料，如許可證號碼、登記地址及獲批准售賣的受限制食物種類。有關的規管條件亦規定出售的大閘蟹必須由可靠和商譽良好的供應商供應，並須備存有關當局簽發且獲本署署長認可的衞生證明書。根據《食物業規例》，任何人無牌經營食物業或未獲准許售賣限制出售的食物，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被罰款五萬元及監禁六個月。

海關提醒商戶不能將虛假商品說明應用於任何貨品或服務；或供應或要約供應已應用虛假商品說明的貨品或服務。如違反《商品說明條例》，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款50萬元及監禁五年。海關十分重視保障消費者權益，如在市面發現任何涉嫌違反《商品說明條例》的活動，會立即採取相應的執法行動。

食環署和海關提醒業界，切勿進口或售賣來歷不明的大閘蟹或其他食品，而消費者亦應光顧信譽良好及領有食環署簽發的介貝類水產動物（大閘蟹）售賣許可證或相關書面准許的商戶。

市民如懷疑有經營者沒有持有相關許可證／准許而出售大閘蟹或出售沒有衞生證明書的大閘蟹，可致電食環署熱線2868 0000，或透過電郵帳戶（enquiries@fehd.gov.hk）舉報。

此外，市民可致電海關24小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/）舉報懷疑違反《商品說明條例》的事宜。 "
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-12-02 19:53,2025-12-02 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200710.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月一日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————
個案涉及一名64歲女子，居於東區。初步調查顯示，她於十一月二十一日至二十七日到訪廣東省廣州市。她在十一月三十日出現發燒及關節痛，同日到東區尤德夫人那打素醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。她的三名家居接觸者，包括一名同行到廣州市的人士，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人在潛伏期曾到訪廣東省，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，會把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據
——————
本港今年累計錄得76宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，七宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

就近期在青衣居住的輸入及本地個案，中心在接獲通報後已即時進行流行病學調查及把他們的活動地點通知食物環境衞生署（食環署），以進行控蚊滅蚊行動。鑑於部分確診個案報稱曾在青衣自然徑行山期間被蚊叮咬，中心評估該徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心自十一月二十三日起呼籲近日曾在青衣北一帶活動或在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電中心早前設立的查詢熱線2125 2373。熱線每日上午九時至下午八時運作。中心接獲兩名有輕微病徵的人士致電查詢，並已安排他們進行抽血檢查，兩人的樣本均對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。

中心上周亦已透過基層醫療署通知葵青區內約130名基層醫療醫生，呼籲他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。政府各相關部門已經針對所有輸入個案加強蚊媒防控措施，以及在當區進行個案主動追蹤工作，中心的流行病學調查仍然繼續。

​特別針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食環署已進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾、以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署亦已要求相關部門在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地。食環署同時向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持分者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-02 19:53,2025-12-02 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200712.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (December 2), the CHP has recorded one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
-----------------------------
 The case involves a 64-year-old female living in Eastern District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Guangzhou in Guangdong from November 21 to 27. She developed a fever and joint pain on November 30 and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on the same day. She was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient has three household contacts, including one travel collateral to Guangzhou. They are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

As the patient stayed in Guangdong Province during the incubation period, the CHP considered that the case was infected during her travel. The case is classified as imported. The CHP will report the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------
Hong Kong has recorded a total of 76 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, seven were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

Regarding the recent imported and local cases residing in Tsing Yi, the CHP initiated immediate epidemiological investigations upon notification and notified the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of the patients' activity locations for mosquito control operations. As some confirmed cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considers the trails to be a higher-risk area. As a precautionary measure, since November 23, the CHP has urged individuals who have recently visited the Tsing Yi North area or hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the CHP's enquiry hotline (2125 2373). The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. The CHP received enquiries from two individuals with mild symptoms and has arranged blood tests for them. Both blood samples tested negative for the chikungunya virus.

Last week, the CHP also informed approximately 130 primary care doctors in Kwai Tsing District through the Primary Healthcare Commission, urging them to closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services. All relevant government departments have strengthened mosquito vector control measures for all imported cases and conducted active case tracing in the district. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the FEHD has been conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. Pamphlets have been also distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations. The FEHD has earlier requested the relevant departments to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. The FEHD also held meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to coordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Furthermore, the FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
政務司司長會見傳媒答問內容（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-12-02 19:40,2025-12-02 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200680.htm,"政務司司長陳國基聯同政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞，今日（十二月二日）下午就二○二五年立法會換屆選舉的安排會見傳媒。以下是陳國基會見傳媒的答問內容：

記者：你好，首先想請問火災後，幾乎所有候選人的宣傳工程都停止，不單候選人，對選民來說都少了渠道和時間去認識這些候選人。這麼快就要投票，會否對各方面都未有足夠時間讓他們做合適的決定？另外，會如何評估現時這個投票率？另外，政府會全力幫助災民，亦會調派公務員做幫助選舉的工作，現在又會安排公務員幫忙支援火災，人手安排方面如何？以及哪一樣事情會比較優先？另外，做選舉公務員的人手會否相應減少？多謝。

政務司司長：首先，我們都明白到，包括我們在內，我想每一位市民都對這次火災深深地覺得很悲痛、很傷心。大家都很希望盡力幫助受災的市民盡快重新生活，我想這是每一位市民的意願。

正如剛才所說，所有立法會的選舉工作要進行，我們很需要一個立法會盡快選出，因為一月一日便要履職。立法會的工作有很多方面，譬如可以匯聚、反映民意，亦要制定法律、監督政府、優化政策等。除了這些需要立法會議員的幫助外，幫助災民方面的工作亦需要立法會議員的幫助，包括有需要修改法例時，他們要幫忙審議；我們要求撥款時，亦需要立法會同意。所以我們希望能夠如期選出立法會議員，能夠盡早幫助市民，特別包括災民在內，解決問題。

當然，我們知道大家是傷痛的，但希望大家都要認清楚剛才所說的立法會選舉的重要性，希望所有合資格的選民出來投票，能夠盡早如期產生一個立法會，這最能夠幫助我們。

至於兩方面的工作有沒有互相先後，這是沒有的。在立法會選舉和幫助災民方面，是雙軌並行，並不會因為選立法會而拖慢我們對災民的幫助工作，這是絕對不會的。

人手方面亦一樣，我們有很多公務員，我們有選舉事務處和選舉管理委員會，每方面都有一套人手去做，所以人手方面是絕對足夠。我亦相信救災工作並不會影響選舉，選舉工作亦都並不會影響到救災。

記者：你好，司長。二○二○年立法會選舉以疫情為由，用《緊急法》延後立法會選舉，為甚麼這次不能用同樣方法？是否當局覺得這次事故的嚴重性沒有疫情那麼高？其實現時很多居民還未找到地方住，很多市民還未收到社工的致電，你如何可以確保受災情影響的居民和每一位受災情影響的香港人可以理性地判斷下一屆立法會選舉的議員？還是整個選舉只是一種轉移視線，淡化災情的一個方法？謝謝司長。

政務司司長：這次火災，政府的關注度、市民的關注度，我想是不容置疑，我們是全力、全心去幫助災民，希望他們盡快回復正常生活。我們覺得如期選舉，而不是將它延期，這個做法是最合適的。如期選出新的立法會議員，他們才能夠幫我們審議法案、修改法例。剛才有記者朋友問及，他們在大火之前亦有展開選舉工程，當然因為大火原因而暫停一段時間，我們希望餘下幾天的時間，透過論壇等讓選民認識候選的立法會議員，借這幾日的機會，盡量介紹他們的政綱給選民認識，所以我們覺得這次如期舉行是一個最適合的安排。

記者：你好，兩方面，首先想問，其實在現時的社會氛圍下，當局如何預測投票率？還有繼續去舉辦這些跟選舉相關的文娛活動或優惠，其實是否合適？另外想問司長，可否解釋一下，為甚麼當局堅持不成立獨立調查委員會？在這個沒有法定傳召權的情況下，當局有沒有甚麼措施或政策可以確保各機構或政府部門會配合調查？

政務司司長：我想重申，我們從來都沒有對投票率有預設目標，如果有預設目標，就是希望每一位合資格選民都出來投票，這是我們的工作目標。剛才我們亦有指出，嘉年華會、「繽紛日」等比較歡樂性的節目，我們都取消了，但一些資訊性、生活性的，我們則保留，因為始終例如選舉展覽，是有教育意義的，特別是對小朋友，他們現在未達成為選民的年齡，但我們很希望能夠透過教育，將來他們一到年齡，就可以成為選民去投票，為香港建設更好的未來。"

政務司司長：各位傳媒朋友大家好。

立法會是政府施政的一個重要合作夥伴。我們明白大家現在很關心如何能幫助受災巿民盡快重新生活，正如行政長官在今日早上指出，選出有抱負、有能力的立法會議員是大埔火災後重建路上重要的一步，當然政府對受災巿民的支援和跟進工作不會停止，與此同時，如期完成選舉，是對社會穩定的維護，更是對災後重建工作的有力支撐。新一屆議員盡早履職，亦能更快、更有效地推進包括善後支援、復原重建，以至法例檢討和改革等重要工作。

行政長官已宣布第八屆立法會換屆選舉將如期在星期日，即十二月七日進行投票。我現在就選舉的相關事宜作進一步的公布。

選舉論壇

首先是選舉論壇，自上星期三發生火災後，我們已即時暫停原訂於上星期四至星期日舉行的八場功能界別選舉論壇，這做法是希望讓社會各界聚焦救災工作。

現時立法會選舉會如期舉行，我們亦會恢復舉辦餘下的八場論壇。因應現時的情況，因為餘下的日子不多，我們會就論壇進行一些調整，適當加入候選人對支援受災居民和災後處理的一些意見，我們亦會詢問他們的意見。

論壇將於明日和後日（即十二月三日及四日）連續兩日恢復舉辦，每日四場。

票站安排

另一方面，因應今次大埔火災，選舉事務處將會重新安排區內的三個票站。受影響的主要包括宏福苑、廣福邨、大埔滘和大埔墟的選民。政制及內地事務局局長稍後會就票站安排和一般選務安排作出更詳細介紹。

選舉繽紛日、免費開放設施及優惠等

至於其他宣傳選舉的安排，因應最新的火災情況，政府不會於十二月六日舉辦「選舉繽紛日」，只會保留資訊性活動，即是於鑽石山荷里活廣場舉行的「選舉與我」巡迴展覽，其他嘉年華、同樂日，以至綜合晚會等活動一概取消。

而十二月六日及七日免費開放政府設施以及由部門提供給全港市民的優惠，很多都是免費入場的優惠將會繼續，當中包括漁護署（漁農自然護理署）的濕地公園；康文署（康樂及文化事務署）的公眾游泳池、香港科學館、香港太空館和香港藝術館的收費展覽會繼續免費開放；活化歷史建築伙伴計劃下的14個項目、法定古蹟景賢里以及元創方的免費導賞團都會繼續；環保署（環境保護署）、食環署（食物環境衞生署）和房委會（香港房屋委員會）轄下的指定商場或街市提供的不同安排等都會繼續。

而選民投票後我們會繼續派發心意謝卡以表達我們的謝意。

我呼籲選民在關注火災善後的同時，亦請於十二月七日投票日積極投票，選出有抱負、有承擔、有理想、有能力的新一屆立法會議員，與政府共同推動經濟民生發展，當然包括大埔火災的善後重建復常工作，一定要共同建設更美好的香港家園。

我現在請政制及內地事務局局長作進一步介紹。

政制及內地事務局局長：各位傳媒朋友大家好。

在選務安排方面，選舉事務處已向全港選民寄出投票通知卡，通知他們所獲編配的一般票站安排，以及已寄出列明新投票時間，即上午七時三十分至晚上十一時三十分的通知。至於其他投票站包括鄰近邊境投票站以及其他專屬及外展投票站，現時相關的登記安排仍然進行中，選舉事務處會陸續發出通知予成功登記的選民，請他們按照選舉事務處所通知的投票時間前往相關票站進行投票。

另外，因應今次大埔火災的影響，選舉事務處亦會重新安排區內的三個票站，包括大埔浸信會公立學校、廣福社區會堂及大埔社區中心。該三個原設票站將更改為香港教師會李興貴中學、大埔崇德黃建常紀念學校及羅定邦中學這三個新票站。受影響的主要包括宏福苑、廣福邨、大埔滘以及大埔墟的選民。由於有關選民須前往新的票站，我們會安排穿梭巴士以便利有關選民前往新票站進行投票。有關詳情選舉事務處今日稍後會發新聞公布通知大家。

至於受火災影響目前居住在其他地區的宏福苑居民，除公布新的票站安排外，我們亦會主動透過「一戶一社工」下的社工人員通知受災居民新的投票站安排，並會視乎他們的投票意願安排合適的交通工具接送他們前往票站進行投票。

我的報告暫時是這麼多。"
Speech by SJ at Third Legal Forum on Interconnectivity and Development (English only) (with photos/video),2025-12-02 19:25,2025-12-02 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200661.htm,"  Following are the closing remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the Third Legal Forum on Interconnectivity and Development under Hong Kong Legal Week 2025 today (December 2):

Deputy Commissioner Zhang Changwei (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), your excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

May I first express my sincere gratitude to the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for co-organising the Legal Forum with the Department of Justice (DoJ) for the third year since the launch of the event back in 2023. I would also like to thank our moderators and speakers, some of whom have travelled from afar to share their invaluable insights; as well as to all of you for participating in the Legal Forum this afternoon.

This Forum has built on the success of the past Forum which stressed on international co-operation and echoed the notion of the Global Governance Initiative (GGI) put forward by President Xi Jinping, while the core concept under the GGI is to maintain and enhance multilateralism. China is a staunch supporter of multilateralism and has made consistent contributions to the advancement of international rule of law. In this regard, we had the honour of opening the afternoon's forum with Professor Huang Jin's keynote speech on China's contribution to international rule of law.

Following the general overview by Professor Huang in his keynote speech, Session 1 looked more specifically at some examples of practising multilateralism and upholding the international rule of law. We had the benefit of learning from the experts from international organisations and from China on how private international law, international mediation and the Greater Bay Area can contribute to practising multilateralism and come up with answers to different global issues in order to uphold the international rule of law.

In this connection, Hong Kong as a global ""super connector"" and ""value-adder"", we strongly support upholding the international rule of law under multilateralism. As you may know, the headquarters of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong opened officially on October 20. The IOMed is the world's first intergovernmental international legal organisation dedicated to resolving international disputes through mediation, and providing an important mechanism for upholding the principles of the Charter of the United Nations (UN). As stated by Mr Wang Yi, Minister of Foreign Affairs during the Signing Ceremony of the IOMed Convention held in Hong Kong on May 30 this year, the IOMed is an actualisation of the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. It fills an institutional gap in international mediation and serves as an important public good in the field of the rule of law for better global governance.

Apart from the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (ROAP) of the HCCH, which has been established in Hong Kong by the Hague Conference on Private International Law since 2012. Other international intergovernmental organisations such as the Bank for International Settlements, International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation have set up offices in Hong Kong. Together with the soon-to-be-established office by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, these establishments will further support the city's strategic position as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution. Their presence in Hong Kong is also evidence of our championing multilateralism.

Alongside the physical set-up of institutions akin to building our ""hardware"", Hong Kong also takes in hand capacity building to invest in our ""software"" development. The Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy, launched in last year's Hong Kong Legal Week, has been organising practical legal courses, seminars and international exchange programmes both locally and abroad to promote international legal talent exchanges. With the expert committee for the Academy (Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Expert Committee) consisting of three advisory boards, comprising 17 legal experts and scholars from renowned international, Mainland and local legal organisations and universities - and quite a few of them are also speakers at this Forum - the Academy breeds and boosts legal expertise, contributing to the country's vision in upholding the international rule of law under the multilateral paradigm.

Turning to our Session 2, we looked further down to the promotion and development of international law through emerging technologies. We had the benefit of hearing from prominent legal experts and technology experts from international organisations and universities on their insights on various emerging issues of the interface between law and technology, ranging from digitisation, cryptocurrency to artificial intelligence (AI). As technology could be a double-edged sword, bringing out convenience and advancements to our daily lives on the one hand, but causing some unforeseen risks to the future of humankind on the other hand, there is a need for the international community to come together to develope international rules that harness the benefits of emerging technologies while addressing the potential risks.

My department attaches great importance to the development in the areas of lawtech and AI. We have established the Consultation Group on LawTech Development in January this year to research and formulate specific recommendations to promote the use of lawtech. We also believe that forums and exhibitions could provide an important platform for fostering exchange and co-operation. As part of this year's Hong Kong Legal Week, we will hold the inaugural Hong Kong LawTech Fest 2025, due to take place from tomorrow till this Friday. The event will bring together legal practitioners, technology providers, experts, academics, and policymakers to explore the fast-evolving intersection of law and artificial intelligence, and to showcase the latest innovative products and services shaping legal practices. Other than exhibitions presenting innovative lawtech and Al products and services, there will be expert-led sessions on the practical application of Al and lawtech in legal practice, finishing on the last day with a main stage LawTech Conference under the theme ""The AI Era: Shaping the Legal Landscape in the 21st Century"", and you are invited to join the LawTech Fest either in person here at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, or virtually online.

We have also supported the UNCITRAL Asia Pacific Judicial Summit, which took place yesterday and concluded earlier this morning, which centred around the themes of digitalisation and the judicial handling of disputes involving the use of AI. Tomorrow morning, we will also have the HCCH Symposium to look at the operation of certain Hague Conventions in the digital age. You are also most welcome to join the Symposium.

Other than the events that I have just mentioned, my department also contributes to the shaping of international rules amidst emerging technologies by participating in various initiatives in collaboration with international organisations and other institutions. For instance, the DoJ Project Office for Collaboration with UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law), established in November 2020 in the Hong Kong Legal Hub, provides support to the initiatives of the Inclusive Global Legal Innovation Platform on Online Dispute Resolution (iGLIP on ODR), to identify possible future work in respect of online dispute resolution. Experts meet regularly to explore the possibility of developing harmonised standards to ensure the legitimacy of online dispute resolution processes. UNCITRAL in its 58th Commission Session this year endorsed the continued collaboration between UNCITRAL and the iGLIP on ODR. This is an example of proactively developing international rules with foresight, instead of responding after problems arise, in the spirit of the principle of solidarity - which calls for choices and actions to be guided by the interests of the international community as a whole.

In our rather ambitious attempt to navigate in one afternoon through the macro topics of multilateralism and emerging technologies insofar as they relate to the development of international law, I hope you have enjoyed the experts' insights and discussions at today's Legal Forum. As with most dialogues generally, we cannot realistically aim at resolving all the complex issues at one time, but rather, start the conversation and plant some seeds for thought on our minds. As we continue with our yearly exchanges through this Forum, I am confident that this incremental collective and cumulative efforts will no doubt bear fruits as we look back someday in future.

Thank you again for joining us today and I look forward to seeing you at the Forum next year, and perhaps, at the remaining events in our Legal Week."

勞工及福利局局長就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒答問內容（附圖／短片）,2025-12-02 18:50,2025-12-02 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200644.htm,"勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十二月二日）聯同菲律賓移工部部長Hans Leo J. Cacdac就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是孫玉菡的答問內容：

記者：你好，剛才局長提到225名外傭，請問是指印傭和菲傭，還是當局掌握的還有其他國籍的外傭在宏福苑工作？另外想問，剛才有提到必定會確保補償會發放到正確的人手上。現在生還的外傭，是否需要親自向你們申請補償，還是勞工處會找到他們的銀行資料並直接發放給他們？另外就工友的情況，勞工處昨日公布有五位工友身故，其實在現場應該有很多判頭和工友，勞工處現在是否掌握當時有多少名工友在場工作，以及他們的情況如何？有關工友的補助會如何發放給他們？最後，是外勞的情況。是否清楚現場有否保安員、清潔員或一些樓宇維修人員是輸入外勞，並在宏福苑工作？

勞工及福利局局長：讓我逐一回答你的問題。第一，據我們現時掌握，在宏福苑工作的外傭共有235名，當中有94名來自菲律賓以及有141名來自印尼。這一刻我們的資料顯示沒有其他國籍的外傭，但我們會持續更新資料。第二，所有有關外傭的財政支援，我們均會通過勞工處和相關的領事館──主要是菲律賓領事館和印尼領事館作發放。具體詳情我們會與領事館討論，目的是要確保我們提供給外傭的所有援助都可以發放到他們手中。如不幸身亡的，亦需確保可以發放到他們的家人手中，這是十分重要的。我尤其想跟大家分享的是，如剛剛部長所說，菲律賓的法律有相關指定。若有任何身亡，當中如何分發及得到補助，我們是需要跟從的。以菲律賓為例，需要跟從菲律賓的相關法律和做法，我覺得這樣是最妥當的。

至於工友方面，正如你所說，這一刻我們掌握到有五名工友不幸在今次大火中喪生。同時，我也想提供一些資料，對於在這次在火警生還或不受影響的工友，我們也會提供兩萬元的補助。經勞工處這刻的統計，估計共牽涉約二百多位工友，當中估計有一百六十名是建造業的工人。他們在這次大維修工程中，未必每天在這裏工作，但整個工程他也有份工作。而清潔工人應該有19名，保安員亦應該有30名。

此外，我留意到你問關於外勞。以我們的判斷，應該是沒有外勞的。大家都理解，建造業的外勞，全部均是通過發展局的計劃，在工務工程才可以合法申請配額並聘請。這個工程並不屬於工務工程，因此不應該取得任何配額。就清潔員和保安員方面，我亦沒有留意到這些公司曾經申請輸入外勞，這是我們現時掌握的數據。當然，如果有更新的資料，我們必定第一時間跟大家報告，但以我們掌握的資料，應該是沒有外勞牽涉在內。

記者：你好。首先，想請問早前有外勞和勞工團體的聯合聲明指有可疑人士用災民家屬的證件獲利，政府有否收到相關求助或發現這個情況？第二，如果有些外傭的僱主不幸在火災中身故，除了剛剛所提到的補助外，有沒有其他的支援，以及如何安排或協調他們之後的工作？

勞工及福利局局長：我想你指的是外傭。第一，我們要提醒大家，在大火災之餘，我們也留意到有一些可恥的騙徒藉此混水摸魚，大家要小心。這個我們也有和領事館仔細討論，也是為何我們一定要通過領事館派發給外傭的補助金，這是第一點。第二點是如果外傭的僱主不幸在這次大火裏身故的話，我們會彈性地、人性化地處理他們轉換僱主的要求，這個我們和入境處已經溝通了，入境處也會提供最大的幫助。事實上，入境處現時已針對外傭的身分證明文件及僱傭合約在大火中燒毀的情況提供緊急服務，讓外傭可以盡快補辦他們的身分證明文件；另外在協助外傭取回一份我們官方認可的僱傭合約方面，我們現在已經在處理了。

記者：剛才提到可能有外傭康復後想轉僱主，如有些僱主是幸存下來的，外傭轉工時是否能獲人性化的安排？可否舉例讓大家知道，外傭是否不用回到原本的國家再回港，或是有甚麼措施？

勞工及福利局局長：大原則是入境處會人性化處理受影響外傭，現時很難一刀切一概而論。大家可以放心，入境處已經向我們表示，會因應每一名外傭的具體處境，作人性化處理。請大家放心。"
Remarks by SLW at media session regarding follow-up work on fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po (with photo/video),2025-12-02 18:50,2025-12-02 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200645.htm,"  The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, met the media today (December 2) with the Secretary for Migrant Workers of the Philippines, Mr Hans Leo J. Cacdac, regarding the follow-up work on the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. Following are Mr Sun's remarks at the media session:

Reporter: Good afternoon, Mr Sun. You mentioned that there will be $800,000 offered to the deceased foreign domestic helpers. Would this be for their families? And how can the families claim this amount of money? And also, who will be responsible for the funeral expenses of the helpers who lost their lives in this tragedy? Is it still the employer in this case?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. We are working closely with the Consulate for those who are going to claim assistance from us. We will work through for the Filipinos with the PCG - the Consul Generals of the Philippines. Number one is to identify and to confirm that they are the ones, and then we are going to distribute through the Labour Department (LD) in Hong Kong where we will work with the Consulate. The key is to make sure that only the genuine family members are eligible to claim the financial assistance for those helpers who died in the incident. Rest assured, we will work closely with the Consulate to make sure that the money is distributed to the right people. I think this is very important.

  For the funeral expenses, there are two parts of it. One part is already covered by the statutory requirement. For all the standard contracts we are issuing for every domestic helper in Hong Kong, there is a standard clause to cover funeral expenses. On top of the existing legal provision, we also provide them with a one-off non-accountable $50,000 relating to their funeral. This is an additional add-on.

Reporter: Thank you, Mr Sun, for the generous support for migrant domestic workers. Indeed, the payout is generous enough. I would just like to ask if this is separate from whatever employee compensation that our migrant workers are entitled to under the law, because right now as I know it stands at more than $500,000 in case of death, and there are separate provisions for those who are injured. If they are entitled to this, will the Hong Kong LD assist them in claiming for their compensation? Thank you.

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: You can rest assured, as I have made clear in my opening remarks, the LD will help them claim the entitlement under the law. As you said, for those who died, they are entitled to receive at least around $500,000 as compensation. You can rest assured that we will do our utmost to make sure they receive it. What I am saying is, apart from what is provided under the law, this time around, there will be an extra one-off financial assistance, which amounts to $250,000 for those who died.

Reporter: Thank you very much. For those migrant domestic workers among the survivors, if some of them are recovering, and for example they do not have any more employment with their employers in Tai Po, would they be given an extension of their 14-day visas in order to look for a job if they wish to continue their employment in Hong Kong?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. We have discussed this with the Immigration Department, so you can have reassurance that they will be as flexible as possible to help the workers. It depends on each and every individual case, but please be assured that we will be as flexible and helpful as possible to help those who are affected and tragically impacted."
EDB facilitates early resumption of face-to-face classes of Tai Po Baptist Public School,2025-12-02 18:27,2025-12-02 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200642.htm,"âA spokesman for the Education Bureau (EDB) today (December 2) announced that the school premises of Tai Po Baptist Public School (TPBPS) will remain closed for a certain period of time due to the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po last week. In order to facilitate early resumption of the normal teaching routine of TPBPS and provide proper care for the students, the EDB has co-ordinated with schools in Tai Po District to deploy available classrooms and successfully arranged for TPBPS students to attend classes by grade level at the school premises of Tai Po Government Primary School and N.T.W.J.W.A Christian Remembrance of Grace Primary School from the middle of this month.

For the next two weeks, TPBPS has arranged for students to resume classes in various modes, including attending classes in classrooms of schools in Tai Po District and participating in learning activities in different venues. The school has announced the arrangements to the parents.

The EDB spokesman said, ""As the school sponsoring body of government primary schools, the EDB fully supports Tai Po Government Primary School in lending out its classrooms. The EDB is also very grateful for the support and co-operation of N.T.W.J.W.A Christian Remembrance of Grace Primary School in assisting affected students to resume their studies.""

The EDB has set up a working group dedicated to implementing the above arrangements. The Government will earmark $5 million to support the operations of the above schools during the transition period and provide appropriate learning and teaching assistance for students and teachers.

The EDB will continue to maintain close contact with the schools and provide necessary assistance."
勞工及福利局局長就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒開場發言（附圖／短片）,2025-12-02 18:24,2025-12-02 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200618.htm,"勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十二月二日）聯同菲律賓移工部部長Hans Leo J. Cacdac就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是孫玉菡的開場發言：

非常感謝菲律賓移工部部長再次來到香港，上次我們見面是在十一月九日，當時部長來香港主持一個位於金鐘為香港菲律賓工人而設的中心，這次很感謝他再來到，我們衷誠傾談，也得到他大力支持。我向他解釋了今次宏福苑大火中不幸身故的外傭會得到我們法定的補償，初步估計超過50萬元。除此之外，他們會得到一次性20萬元慰問金及5萬元補助，我們估計在這次大火中每名不幸身故的外傭約可得到80萬元的補償。

至於在今次大火中受傷的外傭，同樣我們會提供5萬或10萬元的補助，慰問金的金額視乎其在醫院逗留的時間長短而定。除此之外，所有在這次大火中得以逃生的外傭，我們均會提供2萬元的慰問金。另外，無論是受傷或是曾經在宏福苑工作，現時是安全的外傭，我們會提供每人一張面值兩千元的八達通卡。這些我跟部長溝通了，部長也對於我們的工作表示感謝。

另外我想藉這個機會跟大家說一說，最近大家留意到宏福苑大火發生後，很多社福機構第一時間到現場，提供他們力所能及的援助，大多是現金援助。由於時間匆匆，他們很多在現場進行派發，大家都是出於一片善意，希望盡快幫助受影響的居民。但無論是善團或者政府均留意到這樣的做法，對於居民來說就要不斷填表，認為影響了他們的生活。

所以今天我和十間香港主要大的慈善團體見面，談到很多關於救災工作，以及如何派發善款的安排。大家一致同意，已經進行派發的當然先完成，將來而言大家仍有有很多不同類型的資助想派給受影響的居民，請他們全部通過「一戶一社工」處理，意味隨着「一戶一社工」的落實，其實每一名社工都掌握了要幫助的住戶的資料，即不需要再請住戶作申請。我們會有小組作對應，只要團體表明清楚其資助辦法，譬如不幸身故或受傷會提供多少資助、各類型資助為何，相關社工會按其資助條件和內容，跟住戶溝通後自動替住戶作申請，整個申請流程由社工去做。住戶只需要簽名，當資助金通過支票或不同類型的發放模式，我們的同事、社工或相關的公務員會聯絡住戶，可親自把支票送到其居住的地方，或按照他們方便的方法，替他們處理收到的善款。

當然我們理解除了我們慣常接觸的大型慈善團體以外，香港有很多不同類型的慈善團體都想出一分力，如果我們發現有團體想在現場設置攤位，或者有類近想法時，我們會第一時間打電話聯絡團體，提醒其實不需要透過現場形式要大家填表，可以通過「一戶一社工」幫助處理所有這些大家善心想幫居民的捐助和財政的支援。我藉此機會，呼籲全港不同的慈善團體，希望可以做到一站式，省卻居民要不斷填表的需要，在這方面我們希望可以盡快為他們提供最好的幫助。到此我把時間交給部長。"
Opening remarks by SLW at media session regarding follow-up work on fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po (with photo/video),2025-12-02 18:24,2025-12-02 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200610.htm," The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, met the media today (December 2) with the Secretary for Migrant Workers of the Philippines, Mr Hans Leo J. Cacdac, regarding the follow-up work on the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. Following are Mr Sun's opening remarks at the media session:

 Today the Secretary for Migrant Workers of the Philippines is coming to Hong Kong. This is the second time we have met in Hong Kong. The last time we met was on November 9 - the Secretary came to Hong Kong to officiate at the opening of the largest centre in Asia for Filipinos in Hong Kong.

 First of all, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the families of the deceased foreign domestic helpers. At the same time, I wish a very speedy recovery to all those injured in the fire. We are truly grateful for their selflessness and also their heroic acts during the fire, as many of them were taking care of the elderly, children and babies in Wang Fuk Court.

 Let me briefly sum up the support we are going to provide for those who unfortunately died or were injured. For foreign domestic helpers who died in the fire, apart from the statutory compensation, which will be over $500,000, they will also be receiving one-off financial assistance of $200,000, and another $50,000 of support. Adding all together, for foreign domestic helpers who died in the fire, they will be receiving around $800,000, roughly equivalent to US$100,000.

 For those who were injured, they will also be receiving one-off financial assistance, either $50,000 or $100,000, depending on the period of how long they are staying in the hospital. For those who survived the fire, we will also provide $20,000 to them. And for those who were injured or survived the fire, we are also providing them with an Octopus card with an amount of $2,000.

 Let me also give a quick update on the number of foreign domestic helpers in Wang Fuk Court. According to the information available to us, there are a total of 235 foreign domestic helpers working in Wang Fuk court. Among them, according to our record, 10 died in the fire, three are injured, 192 are safe now, and there are still 30 who are missing."
CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another severe paediatric influenza infection case reported,2025-12-02 18:20,2025-12-02 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200621.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (December 2) recorded another severe paediatric influenza infection case. The CHP urged parents to arrange for their children to receive a free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccinations also reduce the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

  The case involves a 6-month-old girl with underlying illness. She developed a fever on November 29 and was brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of North District Hospital on the same day. She was admitted to Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital for treatment. Due to the worsening of her symptoms, she was subsequently transferred to a paediatric intensive care unit of Princess Margaret Hospital. She is currently in serious condition. Her nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A (H1) virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis is influenza A infection complicated with severe pneumonia and septic shock.

  The girl has not yet received the 2025/26 SIV and had no travel history during the incubation period. Two of her household contacts developed mild respiratory symptoms recently, but did not require hospitalisation.

  Including the abovementioned case, there have been 24 severe influenza cases involving children so far this summer influenza season, including three fatal cases. The affected children were aged six months to 17 years. A total of 15 cases have been recorded since the launch of this year's SIV programmes, with only one having received this year's SIV four days prior to the onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, these severe influenza cases are not protected by the vaccine.

  ""According to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity has gradually declined since late October. However, it remains above the baseline thresholds. As the weather turns cooler, influenza activity may still fluctuate. Moreover, a winter influenza season may occur early next year. Therefore, I once again urge all persons aged six months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV to do so promptly. Compared to the winter influenza season earlier this year, there have been more severe paediatric influenza infection cases this season. Currently, among children aged below 18 years, the coverage rate of children aged six months to under two years is relatively low, at 18 per cent only. Parents should not hesitate and should contact their family doctors as soon as possible to arrange for their children, as well as themselves and other family members, to receive the SIV,"" the Head of Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, said.

  He also reminded members of the public that, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly for early treatment if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

  Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

  In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."

過去五年（二○二○年至二○二四年），中心每年錄得一至六宗產志賀毒素大腸桿菌感染個案。計及上述公布的個案，今年至今共錄得三宗產志賀毒素大腸桿菌感染個案，並沒有發現明顯上升趨勢或不尋常的群組個案。

一般而言，產志賀毒素大腸桿菌感染多與進食或飲用受污染的食品或水有關，例如生或未經充分煮熟的肉類、受污染的蔬果或未經消毒的奶製品。同時，該細菌亦可藉由糞口途徑在人與人之間傳播。來自被污染的飲用水和遊憩用水的水源性傳播均曾有報告。市民應注意個人及食物衞生。

CHP investigates imported case of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infection,2025-12-02 17:40,2025-12-02 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200573.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced today (December 2) that it is investigating an imported case of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection and reminded members of the public to maintain good personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent intestinal infections.

The case involves a 14-year-old boy with good past health who developed diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort on November 16. He sought medical attention at aprivate doctor on November 18 and did not require hospitalisation. He has now recovered. His stool sample tested positive for STEC.

A preliminary investigation by the CHP revealed that the patient participated in a school trip to Bali, Indonesia, between November 10 and 15 (within the incubation period). According to available information, the remaining 33 students and teachers who participated in the school trip and the patient’s home contacts are asymptomatic so far. The CHP is following up on their health conditions and will continue to investigate the case.

Over the past five years (2020 to 2024), the CHP recorded one to six cases of STEC infection annually. Including the case announced above, three cases of STEC infection have been recorded so far this year. No significant upward trend or unusual cluster cases have been identified.

Generally, STEC infections are usually associated with the consumption of contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat products, contaminated fruits and vegetables, and unpasteurised dairy products. Direct person-to-person transmission through the faecal-oral route can also occur. Waterborne transmission has been reported, both from contaminated drinking water and from recreational waters. The public are advised to observe good personal and food hygiene.

Members of the public may refer to the CHP'swebpagefor more information about STEC."
再錄得一宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-12-02 17:30,2025-12-02 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200568.htm,"​​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月二日）再接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案。中心呼籲家長盡快安排子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的六個月大女童。她於十一月二十九日出現發燒，同日被帶往北區醫院急症室求診，獲安排於雅麗氏何妙齡那打素醫院留院治療，因病情惡化，其後被轉到瑪嘉烈醫院兒童深切治療部留醫，目前情況嚴重。她的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型（H1）流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發嚴重肺炎和敗血性休克。

女童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗，於潛伏期內不曾外遊。她的兩名家居接觸者近日曾出現呼吸道病徵，病況輕微，無需住院。

計及上述個案，今個夏季流感季節至今已錄得24宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括三宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎六個月至17歲。若單單計算在本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃展開後錄得的15宗個案，只有一人曾在發病前四天接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。然而接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，換言之，這些嚴重個案的兒童都未能受到疫苗保護。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生說：「雖然最新的監測數據顯示，流感活躍程度自十月下旬起逐漸下降，但仍高於基線水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除流感活躍程度仍可能會有反覆，加上明年初或會出現冬季流感季節，因此我再次呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動。對比今年初冬季流感季節，今季兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案較多。目前，18歲以下兒童中，六個月至兩歲以下兒童的覆蓋率相對偏低，只有18%，希望各位家長不要遲疑，請盡快聯絡自己家庭醫生為子女，以至自己和其他家人安排接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

About 800 Chinese Medicine (CM) experts, academics, health officials and industry representatives from Hong Kong, the Mainland, Macao and overseas attended the Conference to exchange views on the future direction of the global development of traditional medicine, clinical services and scientific research development of CM, modernisation research of traditional medicine, and Chinese medicines (CMs) standards.

Distinguished guests for the opening session included the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau; the World Health Organization Regional Director for the Western Pacific, Dr Saia Ma'u Piukala; the Director General of the Science and Technology Department of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Mr Chen Ronghu; the Deputy Director-General of the Health Commission of Guangdong Province and Director of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Bureau of Guangdong Province (TCMBGD), Mr Qiu Yahong; the Director of the Health Bureau of the Macao Special Administrative Region (Macao SAR) Government, Dr Lo Iek-long; and the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam.

Before the start of the Conference, all participants stood up and observed a moment of silence to mourn the victims of the Tai Po fire. In his opening remarks, Professor Lo expressed particular condolences for the victims and the deceased fireman, as well as extended sympathies to their families and affected residents. He also paid tribute to the personnel who took part in the rescue mission, in particular firefighters, police officers and healthcare colleagues, and wished the injured a speedy recovery. ""Healthcare is vital to people's lives and well-being, as well as national security. In the face of major sudden disasters, Hong Kong's public healthcare system has taken up the primary responsibility of emergency response and treatment. The Health Bureau is co-ordinating the efforts of both public and private medical sectors to provide comprehensive healthcare protection to the injured and all affected residents,"" he stressed.

This year's Conference has its theme of ""Greater Bay Area: Traditional Medicine, Global Vision"". Professor Lo said, ""CM experts from various regions gathered at the Conference to explore fostering CM to go global with the collaborative innovation strengths of the GBA, with a view to contributing to the health of all mankind. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has long been committed to promoting the development of CM and assisting the national drive for CM to go global. Among them, two flagship institutions for CM development, namely The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong (CMHHK) and the permanent premises of the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute, will commence services on December 11. They will help drive the development of CM services, professional training, scientific research and innovation, standard-setting, and international co-operation, demonstrating the value and strengths of CM to the world. Furthermore, the CM Development Blueprint will also be released to set out a clear direction for CM development in Hong Kong, with a view to fostering high-quality and high-standard development of CM on all fronts.""

Themed ""Global Development of Traditional Medicine: Policy Support, Research and Innovation, and Regional Collaboration"", the plenary forum of the Conference explored how scientific innovation and cross-regional collaboration can facilitate the deeper integration of traditional medicine into modern healthcare systems. Three parallel forums were held afterwards to discuss (1) CM services, including CM-predominant clinical services and its scientific research development, standardisation of CM services, and the establishment of CMHHK; (2) modernisation research on traditional medicine, covering herbal medicine quality standards, clinical evidence for traditional medicine, and interactions between herbal and pharmaceutical substances; and (3) the development of CMs standardisation, including CMs standards research and setting, challenges in applying CMs standards in practice, and feasibility of inter-regional harmonisation. At the Conference, CMHHK signed strategic collaboration agreements with various provincial-level hospitals and international institutions, and multiple CM co-operation projects within the GBA were also signed.

At the closing session of the Conference, the Under Secretary for Health, Dr Cecilia Fan, delivered concluding remarks. The next conference will be hosted by the Macao SAR Government.

The Conference was jointly organised by the Health Bureau, the TCMBGD, and the Health Bureau of the Macao SAR Government, with the Department of Health, the Hospital Authority and CMHHK as co-organisers."

Customs officers intercepted a 48-year-old incoming female passenger at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (December 1). A total of 37 600 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $169,000 and a duty potential of about $124,000, were seized from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.
