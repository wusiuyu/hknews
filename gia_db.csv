文化體育及旅遊局局長出席香港紅十字會75周年舞台劇《第八原則》啟動禮的致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-08-15 20:18,2025-08-15 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500819.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（八月十五日）出席香港紅十字會75周年舞台劇《第八原則》啟動禮的致辭全文：

何驥會長（香港紅十字會會長）、劉楚釗醫生（香港紅十字會主席）、陳澤濤副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室協調部副部長）、范鴻齡主席（醫院管理局主席）、各位嘉賓、各位香港紅十字會成員、各位觀眾：

大家晚上好！今日很高興出席舞台劇《第八原則》的啟動禮。

香港紅十字會成立於一九五○年，75年來一直與香港人風雨同路、並肩同行。由戰後援助到救災抗疫，每次危難中紅十字會總能迅速動員，配合政府展開緊急賑災和心理支援工作，以專業無私的服務精神，積極履行作為政府「人道助手」的使命。

今晚上演的《第八原則》舞台劇，是紅十字會和香港話劇團聯手打造的原創劇目，生動展現香港人「患難相扶、同舟共濟」的精神。這份精神既是紅十字會歷任成員堅守的共同信念，更是香港社會一直珍視的核心價值。無論面對天災，或面臨公共衞生危機，大家總是團結一致，以實際行動彰顯人間有情。在困境面前，紅十字會與廣大市民凝聚成一股強大的力量，用愛心和汗水譜寫出無數動人的篇章。

展望未來，香港特區政府與紅十字會的夥伴關係勢必更加緊密。在極端天氣頻生的新時代，紅十字將繼續肩負社區防災的責任。此外，為應對人口老化的挑戰，我期望紅十字會可透過其專業網絡聯絡各界，拓展長者服務，傳承人道精神，攜手建立充滿溫情而又堅韌自強的香港。

我想藉此機會，向所有秉持「第八原則」的人道工作者致敬，並衷心感謝台前幕後團隊，把現實中的人道故事轉化成觸動人心的舞台力量。祝願今晚的演出圓滿順利，大家有一個難忘、愉快的晚上，多謝大家！"

來源地：法國
包裝：一公斤
批次編號及此日期或之前食用：C5148130，二○二五年八月十六日
進口商：Ferrarini Pacific Limited

中心發言人說：「中心接獲歐洲聯盟委員會食品和飼料快速預警系統的通報，指上述產品可能受李斯特菌污染，正在法國進行回收。中心得悉事件後，隨即聯絡本地進口商跟進，初步調查發現上述進口商曾進口受影響批次產品。」

相關進口商已按中心指示將受影響批次產品停售及下架。市民可於辦公時間致電相關進口商的熱線查詢，分別為：萬利食品有限公司（電話：2552 7128）；Akiten Limited（電話：2515 0478）；而Ferrarini Pacific Limited亦正展開回收（電話：2573 9800）。

發言人續說：「李斯特菌可在一般烹煮溫度下輕易消滅，但能在冷藏低溫下生存和繁殖。大部分身體健康的人在感染這種細菌後不會出現病徵或只出現輕微病徵如發燒、肌肉疼痛、頭痛、噁心、嘔吐及腹瀉等。但對初生嬰兒、長者和免疫力較低的人，則可能出現嚴重的併發症如敗血症及腦膜炎，甚至死亡。孕婦感染李斯特菌一般症狀輕微，但可導致胎兒流產、夭折、早產，或引致新生嬰兒患上嚴重的感染。」

「為減低感染李斯特菌病的風險，高危人士如孕婦應盡量進食剛煮好的熱食，徹底翻熱冷凍食物，並避免進食或在進食前徹底煮熟高風險食物（即食食物例如凍食肉類、冷燻的海產、軟芝士、沙律等），即使有關食物只屬於一道菜色的一部分。」

發言人說，市民應停止食用受影響產品，如食用有關產品後感到不適，應盡快求醫。

中心會就事件通知業界，並會繼續跟進事件和採取適當行動。調查仍然繼續。"
CFS urges public not to consume two kinds of French soft cheese suspected to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes,2025-08-15 19:42,2025-08-15 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500769.htm,"  The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (August 15) urged the public not to consume two kinds of soft cheese imported from France due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The trade should stop using or selling the affected products immediately if they possess any of them.

  The product details are as follows:

Importer: Ferrarini Pacific Limited
   
  ""The CFS received a notification from the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed of the European Commission that the above-mentioned products are being recalled in France due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately contacted local importers to follow up. A preliminary investigation found that the above-mentioned importers had imported into Hong Kong the affected batches of the products concerned,"" a spokesman for the CFS said.

  The importers concerned have stopped sales and removed from shelves the affected batches of the products. Enquiries can be made to the respective importers' hotlines during office hours. They are: Maxly Food Company Limited (Tel: 2552 7128) and Akiten Limited (Tel: 2515 0478). Ferrarini Pacific Limited has initiated a recall (Tel: 2573 9800).

  ""Listeria monocytogenes can be easily destroyed by cooking but can survive and multiply at refrigerator temperature. Most healthy individuals do not develop symptoms or only have mild symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea when infected. However, severe complications such as septicaemia, meningitis or even death may occur in newborns, the elderly and those with a weaker immune system. Although infected pregnant women may just experience mild symptoms generally, the infection of Listeria monocytogenes may cause miscarriage, infant death, preterm birth, or severe infection in newborns,"" the spokesman added.

  ""In order to reduce the risk of listeriosis, susceptible populations such as pregnant women should consume freshly prepared hot food where possible, reheat chilled food until it is hot all the way through, and avoid high-risk foods, including ready-to-eat food such as cold cuts, cold smoked seafood, soft cheeses, salads, etc, or cook them thoroughly before consumption, even if they are presented as part of a dish.""

  The spokesman advised members of the public to stop consuming the affected products and seek medical treatment if they feel unwell after consuming the products concerned.

  The CFS will alert the trade to the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing."

In his opening speech, Mr Cheuk said that the country had designated August 15 as the National Ecology Day in 2023, aiming to enhance widespread promotion of the country's ecological civilisation concepts, and public awareness towards ecological civilisation. This year's National Ecology Day coincided with the 20th anniversary of President Xi Jinping putting forth the concept that ""lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets"", making this occasion even more special. He emphasised that the HKSAR Government placed great importance in the country's ecological civilisation initiatives, and had been promoting green transformation of society, conserving ecology, and strengthening co-operation with the Mainland, thereby building a beautiful China and a beautiful Hong Kong.

Speaking at the ceremony, Dr Lee stated that the establishment of National Ecological Day was a sign of the country embarking on a new stage of ecological civilisation. The progress of the country on promoting ecological civilisation was evident to all, with a greater emphasis now on harmonious coexistence between development and nature. She also affirmed the work done by the HKSAR Government in moving towards a low-carbon future, which included expanding renewable energy facilities, promoting green transport, and adding green buildings, etc. She called on everyone to integrate conservation into their lives and build a green city together.

Other guests included the Permanent Secretary for Environment and Ecology (Environment), Mr Eddie Cheung; the Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui; the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, Mr Mickey Lai; the Director of Electrical and Mechanical Services, Mr Poon Kwok-ying; the Assistant Director of the Hong Kong Observatory (Radiation Monitoring and Assessment), Mr Lee Lap-shun; member of the Executive Council and Chairman of the Council for Carbon Neutrality and Sustainable Development, Dr Lam Ching-choi; the Chairman of the Environment and Conservation Fund Committee, Dr Eric Cheng; and the Chairman of the Environmental Campaign Committee, Ms Grace Kwok.

At the launching ceremony, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the Joint Rescue Mechanism for Large Aquatic Wild Animals with the Ocean Development Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality to deepen the rescue co-operation of large aquatic wild animals between the two places, and to strengthen the exchange of experience and technology to improve the ecological safety of the adjacent waters of Hong Kong and Shenzhen.

Afterwards, the Interim Vice President (Campus Development and Facilities) of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Professor Ling Kar-kan, hosted the symposium. Speakers of the symposium included the President of the China Institute for Rural Studies of Tsinghua University and Tenured Professor of the School of Public Policy and Management of Tsinghua University, Professor Wang Yahua; Professor of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Professor Wang Yuhong; the Director of the Hong Kong Culture and Sustainability Centre, Professor Louis Yu; the Assistant Director (Country Parks) of the AFCD, Dr Jackie Yip; and the Head of the Countryside Conservation Office of the Environment and Ecology Bureau, Professor Stephen Tang. They shared and exchanged views on rural revitalisation, nature conservation and sustainable development.

​八月份第四批涵蓋兩個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及五個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，除了屯門西及掃管笏，其他都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年八月共四批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共27個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年七月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這27個監察區中，有15個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有九區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。至於指數高於10%的地區，包括沙田馬鞍山、屯門掃管笏及屯門西，按因應基孔肯雅熱情況而實施的安排（即將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域），食環署正聯同有關部門及持份者攜手，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。其中，屯門區的誘蚊器數據顯示蚊患較多的地方包括公園、學校及私人屋苑，各相關部門及持份者正積極跟進。食環署亦會舉辦宣傳展覽、派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。此外，食環署會加強監察該三個地區的誘蚊器指數，以檢視滅蚊工作成效。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：


收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Among the fourth batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering two survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering five survey areas in August, all were below 10 per cent, except Tuen Mun West and So Kwun Wat.

The FEHD has so far announced four batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August, covering 27 survey areas. Among these 27 survey areas, 15 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared with the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. July 2025, representing the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained at a low level. Nine other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent. As for areas with an index over 10 per cent, including Ma On Shan in Sha Tin, and So Kwun Wat and Tuen Mun West in Tuen Mun, in accordance with the mechanism implemented by the FEHD in response to the recent chikungunya fever (CF) situation that strengthens mosquito control work in areas with the gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, which was originally activated when the gravidtrap index reaches 20 per cent or above, the department is collaborating with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with high mosquito infestation and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. In particular, gravidtrap data for Tuen Mun District showed that the areas with more mosquito problems included parks, schools and private housing estates, and the relevant departments and stakeholders are actively following up. Additionally, the FEHD will also organise exhibitions, distribute leaflets and posters, and notify the residential estates subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures. In addition, the FEHD will strengthen the monitoring of the gravidtrap indexes in those three areas to review the effectiveness of the mosquito control work.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue joining hands in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:


tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest Gravidtrap Index and the Density Index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of CF transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools, to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

SCED concludes visit to Australia (with photos),2025-08-15 18:22,2025-08-15 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500583.htm,"The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, continued with the last day of his visit to Sydney, Australia, today (August 15).

In the morning, Mr Yau paid a courtesy call on the Consul-General of the People's Republic of China in Sydney, Mr Wang Yu, to update him on Hong Kong's latest developments and measures to drive sustained economic growth and consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's status as an international trade centre.

Mr Yau then visited an enterprise specialising in beauty and wellness products and exchanged views with its senior management on the vast potential of the Asian market. Mr Yau introduced Hong Kong's distinctive advantage of enjoying the strong support of the motherland while being closely connected to the world under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, and encouraged Australian enterprises to set up regional headquarters in Hong Kong to seize the opportunities of the Mainland, in particular the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and Southeast Asian markets.

Mr Yau also had a lunch meeting with representatives of the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and the local business community to understand the needs and development directions of Australian enterprises and exchange views on fostering closer co-operation in the areas of business and trade between Hong Kong and Australia to achieve mutual benefits.

In the afternoon, Mr Yau met with a representative of the Australian Distillers Association to introduce Hong Kong's reduction in liquor duty to promote liquor trading and boost the development of high value-added industries including logistics and storage, tourism as well as high-end food and beverage consumption. He noted that the initiative has made reference to the successful experience in 2008 regarding the removal of import duty on wine, adding that he looks forward to seeing more premium liquor from Australia seizing the business opportunities. He also visited a distillery to understand more about the process of distilling and the development of Australian spirits.

  In the evening, Mr Yau attended the Hong Kong Australia Business Association NSW Chapter Business Awards Gala Dinner. Speaking at the event, he shared with the Australian business community the distinctive advantages of Hong Kong under the ""one country, two systems"" principle and the opportunities ahead for collaboration between Hong Kong and Australia. One of the examples is the recent enhancements to the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement. Mr Yau said that provisions such as allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law and to choose for arbitration to be seated in Hong Kong empower foreign firms including Australian companies to leverage Hong Kong's legal and financial strengths when tapping into the Mainland market, especially within the GBA.

He added that Hong Kong ranked third globally in terms of foreign direct investment inflows, and with close to 10 000 overseas and Mainland companies as well as 4 700 start-ups present in Hong Kong, the city continues to thrive as a business hub.

Mr Yau said that regionally, Hong Kong is actively seeking to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), adding that Hong Kong will continue to communicate and collaborate with RCEP economies including Australia to advance this important goal.
ã
Mr Yau will return to Hong Kong tomorrow (August 16)."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-08-15 17:30,2025-08-15 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500656.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月十五日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱的輸入個案。中心提醒市民應採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後。若出現發燒或急性關節痛等病徵，應立即就醫並通知醫生相關旅遊史，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。

最新個案資料

新增個案涉及一名居於西貢區的23歲男子。初步調查顯示，他於八月一日起到廣東省佛山市順德區，期間曾被蚊叮咬。他在八月三日回港，八月八日起出現發燒、關節痛及皮疹。他昨日（八月十四日）到將軍澳醫院急症室求診，獲安排入院，在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。

由於病人潛伏期身處佛山市，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。病人沒有其他同行人士或家居接觸者。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得九宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）正進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並會於病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關基孔肯雅熱的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，目前，市面上並沒有獲國際衞生當局認證的快速測試產品，供市民自行測試基孔肯雅熱。若懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱，應立即就醫，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。市民亦不應自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

他補充，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-08-15 17:30,2025-08-15 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500659.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 15), one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. The CHP reminded members of the public to take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures, especially upon returning to Hong Kong from regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. Individuals experiencing symptoms such as fever or acute joint pain should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors of their travel history. Do not attempt self-testing, as this may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Latest case information

The new case involves a 23-year-old male who lives in Sai Kung District. An initial investigation revealed that he travelled to Shunde District, Foshan, in Guangdong Province, on August 1. During his stay, he was bitten by mosquitoes. He returned to Hong Kong on August 3 and developed a fever, joint pain and a rash on August 8. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Tsueng Kwan O Hospital yesterday (August 14) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. He is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing.

Since the patient stayed in Foshan during the incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case was classified as an imported case. The patient has no travel collateral and household contacts. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of nine confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) is conducting vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations and will intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residence of the two patients, as well as locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in the scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspectionof the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âSeparately, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. They have also reminded residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of CF.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, reminded members of the public that currently, there are no rapid test products on the market that have been certified by international health authorities for public use in self-testing for CF. People should promptly seek medical advice if they suspect they are infected with CF and should not conduct testing on their own as this may delay proper clinical treatment. He also urged the public not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example, increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms because it may lead to Reye's syndrome, a serious and potentially fatal complication.

He also added that members of the public should adopt precautions during the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 andpicaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âIn addition, the FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

The TD issued official Taxi Fleet Licences to five taxi fleets in July 2025 with a view to offering quality services to the public. All fleet taxis provide multiple electronic payment means, while safety devices and the driver monitoring system have been installed to provide convenience for passengers and ensure driving safety.

  The Government has also submitted to the Legislative Council the legislative amendments on mandatory installation of Journey Recording Systems and provision of electronic payment means on taxis, strengthening the deterrent effect against malpractice by the black sheep in the taxi industry and safeguarding the interests of both drivers and passengers on one hand, while providing convenience for passengers to pay the fare on the other. Ms Kwok encouraged the trade to continue to strive for excellence to provide more quality ride experiences, thereby giving full play to new opportunities for quality service.

  Among 573 nominated taxi drivers, 20 were selected as Quality Taxi Drivers this year by an assessment panel comprising non-trade members of the CTSQ and relevant department representatives. The Most Popular Taxi Driver was presented to the driver with the highest number of votes in the public voting, while Good Driver, Good Service awards were presented to two drivers providing exceptional services during the ride. In addition, the assessment panel selected one Quality Taxi Service Management Team based on management, application of technology and social responsibility of management teams. The list of awardees is set out in the Annex."
文化體育及旅遊局局長出席全國及大灣區金茶王大賽2025（港式奶茶）----香港區決賽的致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-08-15 17:05,2025-08-15 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500389.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（八月十五日）出席全國及大灣區金茶王大賽2025（港式奶茶）——香港區決賽的致辭全文：

Simon（香港咖啡紅茶協會主席黃家和）、各位好朋友、各位嘉賓、各位傳媒朋友：

今日來到全國及大灣區金茶王大賽2025（港式奶茶）——香港區決賽，來到這裏是特別親切的。好像Simon剛才所說，其實我二○一○年開始已經第一次參加金茶王大賽，坐在這裏當評判，當時和劉總（香港旅遊發展局總幹事劉鎮漢）一起當評判，連續參加了六年，然後就離開了。但是每年美食博覽的時候，都會上來看一看和哥（香港咖啡紅茶協會主席黃家和）外面的booth（攤檔），看看金茶王的進展。

其實港式奶茶真是很配合，除了旅遊，我們說香港「無處不旅遊」，我們美食處處，都在眼前、在附近，待大家發掘外，港式奶茶正正就是中外文化匯聚的佼佼者，其用的茶葉應該主要是西茶茶葉，淡奶也是比較西方的，但是到外國、到西方國家，怎樣喝tea with milk，都喝不到港式奶茶的味道；甚至到內地有很多港式餐廳，其實都是回來香港，那杯茶好像才最有味道，最適合心水。

這也是香港獨特之處，就是取了東方、我們中國的飲茶文化，西方tea with milk文化，放在一起成為了我們很獨特的港式奶茶。我由二○一○年到二○一五年（出席此活動），港式奶茶則是二○一七年成為非物質文化遺產，收錄在名冊之中。現在大家對港式奶茶一定都很有研究，譬如剛剛進來的時候，我在金茶王攤檔喝的時候，我也跟師傅說我要少奶、不要糖，但可能有些在座朋友就認為多奶滑一點，但我喜歡濃一點的，尤其是下午這些時候。這展示了（港式奶茶）可以很多元的，各適其適，我們選擇自己最喜歡的。即使到茶餐廳也是，可以多糖、少奶、多奶，甚至茶走，各樣，都可以有自己性格的。

來到今日，回來金茶王，見到這隻杯子，好像剛才Simon所說，有一年他的孫子在爬的時候，怕他爬了進去或拉了一隻杯子下來會砸到，這些記憶都回來了。我也很希望大家現在，完全在疫情回復過來，香港旅遊業重振雄風的時候，這些美好的記憶全部都回來。我們可以一起，今日見到這麼多業界的好朋友一起，我們同心攜手，將旅遊業、餐飲業、零售業做得比以前更好、更光、更亮、更熱。奶茶最緊要甚麼？是水滾茶靚吧，當然要熱，是不是？好，那我就不阻大家了。今日的比賽和活動，還有很精彩的在後頭，所以我也將時間交給我們美麗的司儀。多謝。"

Grading of beach water quality released,2025-08-15 16:42,2025-08-15 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500635.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (August 15) released the latest grading of water quality for 39 gazetted beaches (see Note 1) and one non-gazetted beach (see Note 2).

  Nineteen beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1), 16 as Fair (Grade 2) and five as Poor (Grade 3).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Cheung Chau Tung Wan Beach*
Silverstrand Beach*


Chung Hom Kok Beach
South Bay Beach*


Clear Water Bay Second Beach*
St. Stephen's Beach


Hap Mun Bay Beach*
Stanley Main Beach*


Hung Shing Yeh Beach*
Tai Po Lung Mei Beach*


Kiu Tsui Beach
Tong Fuk Beach

  Compared with the grading released last week, Big Wave Bay Beach has been changed from Grade 2 to Grade 3.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

Note 1: Lifesaving services are provided by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department at 21 gazetted beaches, marked with an asterisk (*) above, from June 1. For details, please refer to the Leisure and Cultural Services Department's Special Announcement (www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/beach/index.html).

Note 2: This refers to Discovery Bay Tai Pak Beach, which has no lifesaving service."
"Special traffic and transport arrangements for football matches at Hong Kong Stadium on August 19, 20 and 23",2025-08-15 16:37,2025-08-15 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500595.htm,"ããThe Transport Department (TD) today (August 15) said that, to facilitate the holding of football matches at the Hong Kong Stadium on the evenings of August 19, 20 and 23, special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented in the vicinity of So Kon Po and Causeway Bay as follows. Spectators from the Mainland are urged to plan their journeys early, use the MTR, special bus or cross-boundary coach services, and heed the service hours of public transport services and boundary control points.

Road closures

ããThe following road sections will be temporarily closed to vehicular traffic in phases during the event period, until the closed roads are reopened:




Time
Details


From about 5.30pm


The section of Caroline Hill Road between Leighton Road and Cotton Path;
The section of Hysan Avenue westbound carriageway between Yun Ping Road and Hoi Ping Road;
Stadium Path; and
The section of Lee Garden Road between Lan Fong Road and Hysan Avenue (except for Green Minibuses (GMB)).




From about 9.30pm


Caroline Hill Road;
The section of Eastern Hospital Road between Caroline Hill Road and Cotton Path;
The section of Tung Lo Wan Road northbound between Eastern Hospital Road and Causeway Road;
The section of Tung Lo Wan Road southbound between Eastern Hospital Road and Causeway Road (except for franchised bus and GMB);
The northbound carriageway of Link Road (downhill);
Hoi Ping Road, Sunning Road, Sun Wui Road, Lee Garden Road, Lan Fong Road, Foo Ming Street, Pak Sha Road, Yun Ping Road, Kai Chiu Road, Hysan Avenue, Shelter Street and Cotton Path; and
Leighton Road (when necessary).






ããThe TD anticipates that, during the event period, the traffic in the vicinity of So Kon Po and Causeway Bay will be very congested. Motorists are advised to avoid driving to the affected areas.

Public transport service arrangements

ããIn connection with the above road closure arrangements, the following bus and GMB routes operating in the affected areas will be subject to temporary diversion and associated stop relocation arrangements during the event period:




Time
Details


From about 5.30pm


Citybus (CTB) route Nos. 5B and 8H will operate in the form of a circular route;
Cross-harbour bus (XHT) route No. 936 (Shek Wai Kok bound) will terminate at Moreton Terrace instead of Cotton Path; and
CTB route No. 678 (Sheung Shui bound) will depart at Causeway Road instead of Eastern Hospital Road (except for August 23).




From about 10pm


GMB route Nos. 14M, 21A, 21M, 26, 28, 28S and 30 will be temporarily diverted and operate as circular routes, terminating at Keswick Street.






ããThe TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators to strengthen their services during dispersal:


The MTR will enhance the interval between trains of the Island Line and the East Rail Line (ERL) on respective days as and when necessary;
CTB will provide one special bus route No. 976S from Causeway Bay (Moreton Terrace) Bus Terminus to Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange; and
Cross-boundary coach services at Hennessy Road, Wan Chai and Causeway Bay (outside Times Square) will be strengthened at the closing of the event subject to passenger demand to facilitate travellers' return to the Mainland via the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang (LMC/HG) Port and the Shenzhen Bay Port.


Special appeal to cross-boundary travellers

ããSpectators who plan to return to the Mainland on the same day after the football matches should pay special attention that, if they use the Lo Wu Control Point, they should take the MTR Island Line at Causeway Bay Station to Admiralty Station, and interchange the ERL towards Lo Wu Station. The last connecting train towards Lo Wu Station will depart from Causeway Bay Station at 10.44pm and Admiralty Station at 11.01pm. Travellers should plan their journeys ahead and arrive at the station platform in advance.

  For travellers who opt for LMC/HG Port (operating 24 hours daily), apart from the above special bus service route No. 976S directly departing from Causeway Bay, they may also take the MTR ERL to Sheung Shui Station and then KMB route No. 276B or N73, and transfer to the LMC-HG cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) for their journey to the Mainland.

  A spokesman for the TD said that, as a large number of travellers may use the LMC/HG Port after the football matches, and that concerts will also be held at the Kai Tak Sports Park on the evenings of August 19 and 20, the Port is expected to be very busy. Travellers' patience is appreciated. To ensure the smooth operation of public transport services, dedicated public transport lanes will be arranged at the LMC/HG Port after midnight during the event period when necessary for the smooth operation of the Yellow Bus and cross-boundary coach services as well as effective dispersal of a large number of cross-boundary travellers. Other cross-boundary private cars and their passengers are expected to have a longer clearance time. The TD has steered operators to reserve standby vehicles and manpower to meet passengers' demand.

ããMembers of the public are advised to make use of public transport services as far as possible to avoid traffic congestion and unnecessary delays. During the event, the TD and the Police will closely monitor the traffic situation. The Police may adjust the traffic arrangements subject to the prevailing crowd and traffic conditions in the areas. Members of the public should pay attention to the latest traffic news through radio, television or the ""HKeMobility"" mobile application.

ããFor details of the special traffic and public transport arrangements, members of the public may visit the TD website (www.td.gov.hk), its mobile application ""HKeMobility"" or passenger notices issued by the relevant public transport operators."
Economic performance in second quarter of 2025 and latest GDP and price forecasts for 2025 (with photo/video),2025-08-15 16:30,2025-08-15 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500555.htm,"  The Government released today (August 15) the Half-yearly Economic Report 2025, together with the revised figures on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the second quarter of 2025.

  The Acting Government Economist, Dr Cecilia Lam, gave an account of the economic performance in the second quarter of 2025 and the latest GDP and price forecasts for 2025.

Main points

ï¼ The Hong Kong economy continued to expand solidly in the second quarter of 2025, supported by strong exports performance and improved domestic demand. Real GDP grew by 3.1% year-on-year in the second quarter, picking up slightly from the growth of 3.0% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, real GDP rose further by 0.4%.

ï¼ Notwithstanding the ongoing uncertainties to global economy and trade brought about by the United States' (US) trade policy, resilient external demand, together with some rush shipments in response to the US' temporary easing of tariff measures, supported Hong Kong's total exports of goods to see accelerated year-on-year growth of 11.5% in real terms in the second quarter. Meanwhile, thanks to strong growth in inbound tourism, sustained expansion in cross-boundary traffic, and vibrant financial and related business service activities amid the buoyant local stock market, exports of services continued to expand notably by 7.5% in real terms over a year earlier.

ï¼ Domestically, private consumption expenditure resumed moderate growth of 1.9% year-on-year in real terms in the second quarter after four consecutive quarters of decline. Meanwhile, overall investment expenditure increased further by 2.8% in real terms over a year earlier, thanks to a surge in expenditure on machinery, equipment and intellectual property products.

ï¼ The labour market saw some softening in the second quarter. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 3.5% from 3.2% in the preceding quarter. The underemployment rate also increased. Employment earnings grew solidly further over a year earlier.

ï¼ The local stock market maintained upward momentum in the second quarter as market sentiment improved after the situation of trade tensions eased somewhat. The residential property market showed some stabilisation during the quarter. Flat prices held broadly stable, and rentals stayed resilient.

ï¼ Consumer price inflation stayed modest in the second quarter. The underlying Composite Consumer Price Index (Composite CPI) increased by 1.1% over a year earlier, following the 1.2% increase in the preceding quarter. Price pressures on major components were largely contained. Including the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the headline Composite CPI increased by 1.8% over a year earlier, higher than the 1.6% increase in the preceding quarter.

ï¼ Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy is expected to maintain growth for the rest of 2025. Steady economic growth in Asia, in particular the Mainland, together with the sustained increases in local employment earnings, the robust stock market, and the stabilisation of residential property market will bode well for various sectors of the Hong Kong economy. The Government's various measures to boost consumption, attract investment and diversify markets will also provide further support to the Hong Kong economy. Yet, the tariff rates announced by the US in early August stay elevated, and its tariff policy on some commodities remains quite uncertain. The impact of these developments on international trade flows and also the US' inflation and economic activities may surface gradually later this year. Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding the pace of interest rate cut in the US will also affect local investment sentiment. Hong Kong's economic growth momentum going forward will, to a certain extent, depend on how these factors evolve.

ï¼ Taking into account the actual outturn in the first half of the year and the latest developments of the global and local situation, the real GDP growth forecast for 2025 as a whole is maintained at 2%-3%, the same as that in the May round of review. The Government will continue to closely monitor the situation.

ï¼ On the inflation outlook, overall inflation should remain modest in the near term as pressures from domestic costs and external prices should stay broadly in check.

Details

GDP

  According to the revised figures released today by the Census and Statistics Department, real GDP grew by 3.1% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025 (same as the advance estimate), having increased by 3.0% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison, real GDP rose by 0.4% in the second quarter (same as the advance estimate), after a 1.8% increase in the preceding quarter (Chart).

  The latest figures on GDP and its major expenditure components up to the second quarter of 2025 are presented in Table 1. Developments in different segments of the economy in the second quarter are described below.

External trade

  Total exports of goods saw accelerated year-on-year growth of 11.5% in real terms in the second quarter of 2025, following an 8.4% increase in the preceding quarter. Resilient external demand, together with some rush shipments in response to the US' temporary easing of tariff measures, rendered support to export performance. Analysed by major market and by reference to external merchandise trade statistics, exports to the Mainland posted further double-digit growth. Exports to ASEAN markets accelerated further, and those to most high-income Asian economies saw increases of varying degrees. Exports to the US turned to a decline, and those to the European Union fell further. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, total exports of goods rose by 2.9% in real terms in the second quarter.

  Exports of services continued to expand notably by 7.5% in real terms in the second quarter over a year earlier, after growing by 6.3% in the preceding quarter. Exports of all major service groups showed further increases. Specifically, exports of travel and transport services rose further thanks to strong growth in inbound tourism and sustained expansion in cross-boundary traffic. Exports of financial services and business and other services also continued to grow, supported by vibrant financial and related business service activities amid the buoyant local stock market. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, exports of services edged down by 0.5% in real terms in the second quarter.

Domestic sector

  Private consumption saw some stabilisation in the second quarter of 2025, showing a turnaround after a year of subdued performance amid the changes in residents' consumption patterns. The continued increase in employment earnings, the decline in local interest rates, the buoyant local stock market, and the stabilisation of residential property market have provided support. Private consumption expenditure turned to an increase of 1.9% in real terms in the second quarter over a year earlier, after declining by 1.2% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter to quarter basis, private consumption expenditure increased by 3.4% in real terms. Meanwhile, government consumption expenditure increased by 2.5% in real terms in the second quarter over a year earlier, after rising by 0.9% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter to quarter basis, government consumption expenditure increased by 0.9% in real terms.

  Overall investment expenditure in terms of gross domestic fixed capital formation increased by 2.8% in real terms in the second quarter over a year earlier, further to a 1.1% increase in the preceding quarter. Expenditure on acquisitions of machinery, equipment and intellectual property products leapt by 38.4%, with private sector spending showing particularly strong growth. Yet, expenditure on building and construction continued to contract by 9.5%. Costs of ownership transfer shrank by 8.7% from a high base last year.

The labour sector

  The labour market saw some softening in the second quarter of 2025. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 3.5% from 3.2% in the preceding quarter. The underemployment rate also increased to 1.4% from 1.1%. The median monthly employment earnings of full-time employees in nominal terms grew solidly further by 6.3% in the second quarter over a year earlier.

The asset markets

  The local stock market maintained upward momentum in the second quarter of 2025. Despite a sharp sell-off alongside other major markets following the US’ announcement of the so-called ""reciprocal tariffs"" in early April, market sentiment improved subsequently as trade tensions eased after the US temporarily suspended many of these tariffs. The Hang Seng Index (HSI) recouped lost grounds and sustained the uptrend to close the second quarter at 24 072, up 4.1% from end-March. Since entering the third quarter, local stock market has stayed vibrant, with the HSI surpassing the level at the end of the second quarter in recent days.

  The residential property market showed some stabilisation in the second quarter. Market sentiment continued to improve amid easing external uncertainties, particularly after the sharp declines in the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in May which subsequently lowered mortgage rates. Overall flat prices held broadly stable, rising back by 1% during the second quarter. Largely driven by the notable declines in mortgage rates during the quarter, the index of home purchase affordability improved further to around 55%, which was comparable to the long-term average. The number of transactions, in terms of the total number of sale and purchase agreements for residential property received by the Land Registry, rebounded appreciably by 37% over the preceding quarter to 16 574 in the second quarter, only 7% lower than the high level a year ago. Overall flat rentals stayed resilient, with a further increase of 1% between March and June. The non-residential property market stayed weak in general in the second quarter. While prices and rentals remained soft, trading activities of all major market segments picked up.

Prices

  Consumer price inflation stayed modest in the second quarter of 2025. The underlying Composite CPI increased by 1.1% in the second quarter over a year earlier, following the 1.2% increase in the preceding quarter. Major components generally saw modest to moderate changes as compared with a year earlier, as domestic and external price pressures stayed broadly in check. Including the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the headline Composite CPI increased by 1.8% in the second quarter over a year earlier, higher than the 1.6% increase in the preceding quarter. The headline inflation rate was higher than its underlying counterpart in the second quarter, mainly due to the smaller electricity charges subsidy provided by the Government and lower ceiling of rates concession compared with the same period last year.

Latest GDP and price forecasts for 2025

  Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy is expected to maintain growth for the rest of 2025. Steady economic growth in Asia, in particular the Mainland, together with the sustained increases in local employment earnings, the robust stock market, and the stabilisation of residential property market will bode well for various sectors of the Hong Kong economy. The Government’s various measures to boost consumption, attract investment and diversify markets will also provide further support to the Hong Kong economy. Yet, the tariff rates announced by the US in early August stay elevated, and its tariff policy on some commodities remains quite uncertain. The impact of these developments on international trade flows and also the US' inflation and economic activities may surface gradually later this year. Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding the pace of interest rate cut in the US will also affect local investment sentiment. Hong Kong's economic growth momentum going forward will, to a certain extent, depend on how these factors evolve.

  Taking into account the actual outturn in the first half of the year and the latest developments of the global and local situation, the real GDP growth forecast for 2025 as a whole is maintained at 2%-3%, the same as that in the May round of review (Table 2). The Government will continue to closely monitor the situation. For reference, the latest growth forecasts by private sector analysts range between 1.8% and 3.0%, averaging around 2.4%.

  On the inflation outlook, overall inflation should remain modest in the near term as pressures from domestic costs and external prices should stay broadly in check. Considering that the inflation situation in the first half of the year was broadly in line with earlier expectations, the forecasts for the underlying and headline consumer price inflation rates for 2025 are maintained at 1.5% and 1.8% respectively, the same as those in the May round of review (Table 2).

""Composite Employment Estimates 2024""

  In studies of employment statistics, the issue of discrepancies observed between the employment data obtained from establishment-based surveys (which refer to occupied posts in firms) and those data obtained from household surveys (which refer to persons employed) is common. To tackle this, the C&SD has been compiling a set of Composite Employment Estimates (CEE) which reconciles, under a designated statistical framework, the results obtained from the household-based General Household Survey and the establishment-based Quarterly Survey of Employment and Vacancies since 1997.

  This feature article provides the CEE figures in individual industries for 2019 to 2024. It also gives an account of the characteristics of CEE and briefly discusses the differences and usage of CEE vis-à-vis the other employment figures.

  For enquiries about this feature article, please contact the Employment Statistics Section of the C&SD (Tel: 2582 4751; email: employment@censtatd.gov.hk).

  Published in bilingual form, the HKMDS is a compact volume of official statistics containing about 130 tables. It collects up-to-date statistical series on various aspects of the social and economic situation of Hong Kong. Topics include population; labour; external trade; National Income and Balance of Payments; prices; business performance; energy; housing and property; government accounts, finance and insurance; and transport, communications and tourism.

Economic performance in second quarter of 2025 and latest GDP and price forecasts for 2025,2025-08-15 16:30,2025-08-15 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500555.htm,"  The Government released today (August 15) the Half-yearly Economic Report 2025, together with the revised figures on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the second quarter of 2025.

  The Acting Government Economist, Dr Cecilia Lam, gave an account of the economic performance in the second quarter of 2025 and the latest GDP and price forecasts for 2025.

Main points

ï¼ The Hong Kong economy continued to expand solidly in the second quarter of 2025, supported by strong exports performance and improved domestic demand. Real GDP grew by 3.1% year-on-year in the second quarter, picking up slightly from the growth of 3.0% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, real GDP rose further by 0.4%.

ï¼ Notwithstanding the ongoing uncertainties to global economy and trade brought about by the United States' (US) trade policy, resilient external demand, together with some rush shipments in response to the US' temporary easing of tariff measures, supported Hong Kong's total exports of goods to see accelerated year-on-year growth of 11.5% in real terms in the second quarter. Meanwhile, thanks to strong growth in inbound tourism, sustained expansion in cross-boundary traffic, and vibrant financial and related business service activities amid the buoyant local stock market, exports of services continued to expand notably by 7.5% in real terms over a year earlier.

ï¼ Domestically, private consumption expenditure resumed moderate growth of 1.9% year-on-year in real terms in the second quarter after four consecutive quarters of decline. Meanwhile, overall investment expenditure increased further by 2.8% in real terms over a year earlier, thanks to a surge in expenditure on machinery, equipment and intellectual property products.

ï¼ The labour market saw some softening in the second quarter. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 3.5% from 3.2% in the preceding quarter. The underemployment rate also increased. Employment earnings grew solidly further over a year earlier.

ï¼ The local stock market maintained upward momentum in the second quarter as market sentiment improved after the situation of trade tensions eased somewhat. The residential property market showed some stabilisation during the quarter. Flat prices held broadly stable, and rentals stayed resilient.

ï¼ Consumer price inflation stayed modest in the second quarter. The underlying Composite Consumer Price Index (Composite CPI) increased by 1.1% over a year earlier, following the 1.2% increase in the preceding quarter. Price pressures on major components were largely contained. Including the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the headline Composite CPI increased by 1.8% over a year earlier, higher than the 1.6% increase in the preceding quarter.

ï¼ Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy is expected to maintain growth for the rest of 2025. Steady economic growth in Asia, in particular the Mainland, together with the sustained increases in local employment earnings, the robust stock market, and the stabilisation of residential property market will bode well for various sectors of the Hong Kong economy. The Government's various measures to boost consumption, attract investment and diversify markets will also provide further support to the Hong Kong economy. Yet, the tariff rates announced by the US in early August stay elevated, and its tariff policy on some commodities remains quite uncertain. The impact of these developments on international trade flows and also the US' inflation and economic activities may surface gradually later this year. Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding the pace of interest rate cut in the US will also affect local investment sentiment. Hong Kong's economic growth momentum going forward will, to a certain extent, depend on how these factors evolve.

ï¼ Taking into account the actual outturn in the first half of the year and the latest developments of the global and local situation, the real GDP growth forecast for 2025 as a whole is maintained at 2%-3%, the same as that in the May round of review. The Government will continue to closely monitor the situation.

ï¼ On the inflation outlook, overall inflation should remain modest in the near term as pressures from domestic costs and external prices should stay broadly in check. Considering that the inflation situation in the first half of the year was broadly in line with earlier expectations, the forecasts for the underlying and headline consumer price inflation rates for 2025 are maintained at 1.5% and 1.8% respectively, the same as those in the May round of review.

Update on dengue fever,2025-08-15 16:30,2025-08-15 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500576.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (August 15) reported the latest number of dengue fever (DF) cases. The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui,reminded the public that due to the increase in temperature and rainfall in summer, mosquito infestation might be aggravated in Hong Kong. In addition, members of the public will travel to DF-endemic regions more frequently during the summer holiday. Therefore, the risk of DF in Hong Kong is increasing.

  From August 8 to yesterday (August 14), the CHP recorded two imported DF cases. The patients had travelled to Cambodia and India during the incubation periods respectively.

As of yesterday, 41 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases and more than 7 300 dengue-related deaths were reported in over 80 countries/territories. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number.

  DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 20 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 000 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 586 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 121 cases were recorded in the week between August 4 and 10, with the highest number of cases recorded in Guangzhou, Foshan, Chaozhou and Shenzhen.

Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

  ""There have been frequent imported cases of DF in Hong Kong, as well as occasional sporadic local cases every year. The presence of Aedes albopictus in Hong Kong makes our population vulnerable. Mosquitoes breed quickly during the hot and rainy summer months. There are risks of DF outbreaks if mosquito control is inadequate. Hence, mosquito control is of paramount importance. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. The public is reminded that eliminating mosquito breeding sites and avoiding mosquito bites are key to preventing DF. Those returning from areas affected by DF should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. If feeling unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to a doctor,"" Dr Tsui added.

  Members of the public are also reminded to take heed of the following advice on mosquito control:


Thoroughly check all gully traps, roof gutters, surface channels and drains to prevent blockage;
Scrub and clean drains and surface channels with an alkaline detergent compound at least once a week to remove any deposited mosquito eggs;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxes, in covered litter containers;
Completely change the water of flowers and plants at least once a week. The use of saucers should be avoided if possible;
Level irregular ground surfaces before the rainy season;
Avoid staying in shrubby areas; and
Take personal protective measures such as wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothes and trousers, and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or uncovered areas of the body when doing outdoor activities.

登革熱最新情況,2025-08-15 16:30,2025-08-15 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500574.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月十五日）公布登革熱個案的最新數字。中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，由於在夏季期間氣溫及雨量上升，本港蚊患情況可能會加劇，加上市民在暑假會較頻繁前往登革熱流行地區，因此本地登革熱的風險正在上升。

由八月八日至昨日（八月十四日），中心錄得兩宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期內曾分別到柬埔寨及印度。

截至昨日，今年錄得41宗外地傳入登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。在二○二三年，全球80多個國家及地區共呈報了逾650萬宗病例和7 300多宗登革熱相關死亡個案。世衞於二○二四年更錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點普遍流行，印度尼西亞、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年至今已分別錄得超過二萬宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過3 000宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得586宗本地感染病例，於八月四日至十日的一周內錄得121宗，其中以廣州、佛山、潮州和深圳的病例最多。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

徐樂堅醫生說：「本港經常有外地傳入的登革熱個案，每年間中亦有零星的本地登革熱個案。由於香港存在白紋伊蚊，本地市民有機會受感染。炎熱多雨的季節有利蚊子迅速繁殖。如控蚊成效不足，更有爆發登革熱的風險。因此，控蚊工作至關重要。不論在本地或外遊時，應時刻保持環境衞生、注意防蚊控蚊及採取個人保護措施。大家應緊記防止蚊子滋生及避免被蚊叮是預防登革熱的最佳方法。市民如從受登革熱影響地區回港，應在14日內繼續使用昆蟲驅避劑。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節。」

市民應繼續採取下列防蚊措施：


徹底檢查集水溝氣隔、屋頂雨水槽、明渠及排水渠，避免淤塞；
每星期至少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，以除去可能積聚的蚊卵；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，盡量避免使用墊碟；
在雨季前把凹凸不平的地面填平；
避免在叢林逗留；及
戶外活動期間，做好個人保護措施，穿着淺色長袖上衣和長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服上塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。


​含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，市民應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​​市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務登革熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁及YouTube頻道。"
二零二五年第二季經濟表現及二零二五年本地生產總值和物價最新預測,2025-08-15 16:30,2025-08-15 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500565.htm,"政府今日（八月十五日）發表《二零二五年半年經濟報告》和二零二五年第二季度的本地生產總值修訂數字。

署理政府經濟顧問林幗瑛博士闡述二零二五年第二季的經濟表現，以及最新的二零二五年全年本地生產總值和物價預測。

要點

＊在出口表現強勁及本地需求改善的支持下，香港經濟在二零二五年第二季繼續穩健擴張。實質本地生產總值在第二季按年增長3.1%，輕微高於上一季3.0%的增幅。經季節性調整後按季比較，實質本地生產總值進一步上升0.4%。

＊儘管美國貿易政策持續對全球經濟及貿易帶來不確定性，外部需求強韌，加上因美國暫緩關稅措施而令部分貨物搶先付運，支持香港整體貨物出口在第二季按年實質增長加快至11.5%。同時，受惠於訪港旅遊業強勁增長、跨境運輸量持續擴張，以及金融及相關商業服務活動在本地股市暢旺下表現活躍，服務輸出繼續按年實質顯著擴張7.5%。

＊本地方面，私人消費開支經過連續四季下跌後，在第二季恢復溫和增長，按年實質上升1.9%。同時，受惠於購置機器、設備及知識產權產品的開支急升，整體投資開支按年進一步實質上升2.8%。

＊勞工市場在第二季稍為放緩。經季節性調整的失業率由上一季的3.2%上升至3.5%。就業不足率亦上升。就業收入按年進一步穩健增長。

＊由於市場氣氛在貿易緊張局勢有所緩解後好轉，本地股票市場在第二季維持升勢。季內住宅物業市場略見回穩。住宅售價大致企穩，租金保持強韌。

＊第二季消費物價通脹維持輕微。基本綜合消費物價指數按年上升1.1%，上一季的升幅為1.2%。主要組成項目的價格壓力大致受控。計及政府的一次性紓緩措施的效應，整體綜合消費物價指數按年上升1.8%，高於上一季的1.6%。

＊展望未來，香港經濟在二零二五年餘下時間可望保持增長。亞洲尤其是內地經濟持續穩步增長，加上本地就業收入持續增加、股票市場暢旺，以及住宅物業市場回穩，將會利好香港經濟的各個環節。政府多項提振消費、吸引投資，以及開拓市場的措施，亦會為本港經濟提供進一步支持。然而，美國在八月初公布的關稅水平仍然偏高，對部分商品的關稅政策仍相當不明朗。這些發展對國際貿易流向，以至美國當地通脹和經濟活動的影響或會在今年稍後時間陸續浮現。此外，美國減息步伐的不確定性亦會影響本地投資氣氛。香港經濟往後的增長動力將在一定程度上取決於這些因素如何演變。

＊考慮到今年上半年的實際數字以及全球和本地情況的最新發展，二零二五年全年實質本地生產總值增長預測維持在2%至3%，和五月覆檢時相同。政府將繼續密切監察相關情況。

＊通脹展望方面，由於本地成本和外圍價格壓力應會大致可控，整體通脹短期內應維持輕微。考慮到今年上半年的通脹情況與較早時預計相若，二零二五年基本和整體消費物價通脹率的預測分別維持在1.5%及1.8%，與五月覆檢時相同。 

詳細分析

本地生產總值

根據政府統計處今天發布的修訂數字，二零二五年第二季實質本地生產總值按年增長3.1%（與預先估計相同），上一季上升3.0%。經季節性調整後按季比較，實質本地生產總值在第二季上升0.4%（與預先估計相同），上一季上升1.8%（圖）。

附表一載列了截至二零二五年第二季的本地生產總值及其主要開支組成部分的最新數字。各經濟環節在第二季的發展情況詳述如下。

對外貿易

整體貨物出口繼上一季按年實質上升8.4%後，在二零二五年第二季的增長加快至11.5%。外部需求強韌，加上因美國暫緩關稅措施而令部分貨物搶先付運，均為出口表現提供支持。參考對外商品貿易統計數字並按主要市場分析，輸往內地的出口繼續錄得雙位數增長。輸往東盟市場的出口進一步加快，輸往大部分亞洲高收入經濟體的出口錄得不同程度升幅。輸往美國的出口轉為下跌，輸往歐盟的出口進一步下跌。經季節性調整後按季比較，整體貨物出口在第二季實質上升2.9%。

服務輸出繼上一季按年實質增長6.3%後，在第二季繼續顯著擴張7.5%。所有主要服務組別的輸出均進一步增加。具體而言，受惠於訪港旅遊業強勁增長和跨境運輸量持續擴張，旅遊服務輸出和運輸服務輸出進一步上升。受惠於金融及相關商業服務活動在本地股市暢旺下表現活躍，金融服務輸出和商用及其他服務輸出亦繼續增長。經季節性調整後按季比較，服務輸出在第二季實質微跌0.5%。

內部經濟

私人消費在二零二五年第二季略見回穩，扭轉在此之前的一年間在市民消費模式改變下的疲弱表現。就業收入持續增加、本地息口下降、本地股票市場暢旺，以及住宅物業市場回穩提供了支持。私人消費開支在第二季轉為按年實質上升1.9%，上一季下跌1.2%。經季節性調整後按季比較，私人消費開支實質上升3.4%。同時，政府消費開支繼上一季按年實質上升0.9%後，在第二季上升2.5%。經季節性調整後按季比較，政府消費開支實質上升0.9%。

按本地固定資本形成總額計算的整體投資開支繼上一季按年實質上升1.1%後，在第二季上升2.8%。購置機器、設備及知識產權產品的開支躍升38.4%，當中私營機構開支增幅尤為強勁。然而，樓宇及建造開支繼續減少9.5%。擁有權轉讓費用較去年的高基數縮減8.7%。

勞工市場

勞工市場在二零二五年第二季稍為放緩。經季節性調整的失業率由上一季的3.2%上升至3.5%。就業不足率亦由1.1%上升至1.4%。全職僱員每月就業收入中位數以名義計算在第二季按年進一步穩健增長6.3%。

資產市場

本地股票市場在二零二五年第二季維持升勢。儘管四月初美國宣布徵收所謂的「對等關稅」後，港股跟隨其他主要市場出現大幅拋售，但其後美國暫緩實施大部分關稅措施，貿易緊張局勢緩和，市場氣氛因而好轉。恒生指數（恒指）收復失地並持續上升，於第二季末收報24 072點，較三月底高4.1%。踏入第三季以來，本地股市保持暢旺，近日恒指已超越第二季末的水平。

住宅物業市場在第二季略見回穩。隨着外圍環境的不確定性有所緩解，尤其是在港元銀行同業拆息於五月急跌帶動按揭利率向下後，市場氣氛持續改善。整體住宅售價大致企穩，在第二季內回升1%。主要受按揭利率在季內顯著下跌所帶動，置業負擔指數進一步改善至約55%，與長期平均數相若。交投量方面，第二季送交土地註冊處註冊的住宅物業買賣合約總數較上一季顯著反彈37%至16 574 份，較一年前的高水平僅低 7%。整體住宅租金保持強韌，在三月至六月期間進一步上升1%。非住宅物業市場在第二季大致維持疲弱。售價和租金仍然偏軟，所有主要市場環節的交投活動則有所增加。

物價

二零二五年第二季消費物價通脹維持輕微。基本綜合消費物價指數在第二季按年上升1.1%，上一季的升幅為1.2%。主要組成項目與一年前相比普遍呈現輕微至溫和變動，反映本地和外圍價格壓力大致受控。計及政府的一次性紓緩措施的效應，整體綜合消費物價指數在第二季按年上升1.8%，高於上一季的1.6%。第二季整體通脹率高於基本通脹率，主要是由於政府提供的電費補貼較去年同期少，差餉寬減上限亦較去年同期低。

二零二五年本地生產總值和物價的最新預測

展望未來，香港經濟在二零二五年餘下時間可望保持增長。亞洲尤其是內地經濟持續穩步增長，加上本地就業收入持續增加、股票市場暢旺，以及住宅物業市場回穩，將會利好香港經濟的各個環節。政府多項提振消費、吸引投資，以及開拓市場的措施，亦會為本港經濟提供進一步支持。然而，美國在八月初公布的關稅水平仍然偏高，對部分商品的關稅政策仍相當不明朗。這些發展對國際貿易流向，以至美國當地通脹和經濟活動的影響或會在今年稍後時間陸續浮現。此外，美國減息步伐的不確定性亦會影響本地投資氣氛。香港經濟往後的增長動力將在一定程度上取決於這些因素如何演變。

考慮到二零二五年上半年的實際數字以及全球和本地情況的最新發展，二零二五年全年實質本地生產總值增長預測維持在2%至3%，和五月覆檢時相同（附表二）。政府將繼續密切監察相關情況。作為參考，現時私營機構分析員的增長預測介乎1.8%至3.0%之間，平均約為2.4%。

通脹展望方面，由於本地成本和外圍價格壓力應仍大致可控，整體通脹短期內應維持輕微。考慮到今年上半年的通脹情況與較早時預計相若，二零二五年基本和整體消費物價通脹率的預測分別維持在1.5%及1.8%，與五月覆檢時相同（附表二）。

 The 2025 Election Committee Subsector (ECSS) By-elections will be held on September 7 (Sunday). The Chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission, Mr Justice David Lok, inspected the hands-on training session organised by the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) today (August 15) to see for himself the training provided to the electoral staff of the central counting station.

 The staff participating in the training today will mainly perform counting duties at the central counting station on the polling day. This training session aims to enhance their understanding of the operation of the relevant system and workflow, and the way to quickly input the votes obtained by each candidate to the relevant system if the fallback counting contingency plan is activated, to ensure that the votes are counted in an accurate and efficient manner.

 Mr Justice Lok said that this training session and simulation could enable the staff to get familiar with the relevant details and arrangements, and the measures to be taken in case of contingencies. He also thanked the electoral staff for their joint efforts and dedication in ensuring that the count would be conducted openly, fairly and honestly.

Five ordinary polling stations will be set up for the ECSS By-elections. After the close of the poll, all ballot boxes will be delivered to the central counting station located at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre for counting. The entire counting process involves different steps and details. The REO will continue to arrange different training sessions and simulation exercises for staff responsible for various tasks, including those responsible for operating the electronic counting machines, with an aim of deepening their understanding of their work while at the same time strengthening the co-ordination and response capabilities among staff with different responsibilities for making a detailed and comprehensive preparation for the By-elections and ensuring that the counting of votes can be carried out smoothly."

下列路段將於賽事日子分階段臨時封閉，禁止車輛進入，直至封閉道路重開：




時間
詳情


下午約五時三十分起


介乎禮頓道與棉花路的一段加路連山道；
介乎恩平道及開平道的一段希慎道（西行）行車線；

運輸署預計活動期間，掃桿埔及銅鑼灣一帶的交通會非常擠塞，駕駛人士應避免駕車前往受影響地區。

公共運輸服務安排

為配合上述封路安排，以下行經受影響地區的巴士及專線小巴路線將於賽事日子，實施改道及相應臨時遷移站點安排：




時間
詳情


下午約五時三十分起


城巴第5B及8H號線會於活動開始期間改為循環線；
隧巴第936號線（往石圍角）的總站會由棉花路改為摩頓臺；及

晚上約十時起
專線小巴第14M、21A、21M、26、28、28S及30號線將臨時改道及以循環線形式運作，並改以敬誠街為終點站。




運輸署已協調本地及跨境公共運輸服務營辦商在離場時段加強服務：


港鐵將按需要於相關日子加密港島綫及東鐵綫的班次；
城巴將於銅鑼灣（摩頓臺）巴士總站開辦一條特別巴士路線第976S號線前往落馬洲（新田）公共運輸交匯處；及
位於灣仔軒尼詩道及銅鑼灣（時代廣場外）的跨境巴士服務會在活動結束後因應乘客需求而加強服務，便利旅客經落馬洲／皇崗口岸和深圳灣口岸返回內地。


對跨境旅客的特別呼籲

計劃在足球賽事完結後即日返回內地的觀眾需特別注意，如經羅湖口岸過關，需先在港鐵銅鑼灣站乘港島綫至金鐘，然後轉乘東鐵綫至羅湖站。最後一班可接駁往羅湖站的列車會於晚上十時四十四分由銅鑼灣站及十一時○一分由金鐘站開出。旅客應妥善規劃行程，提前前往車站月台。

使用落馬洲／皇崗口岸（全日24小時通關）過關的旅客，除可直接在銅鑼灣乘搭上述特別巴士第976S號線外，亦可乘搭港鐵東鐵綫往上水站轉乘九巴第276B或N73號線往落馬洲（新田）公共運輸交匯處，轉乘落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）返回內地。

運輸署發言人表示，由於或有大量旅客在足球賽事後使用落馬洲／皇崗口岸，加上八月十九及二十日晚上啟德體育園亦會舉行演唱會，預計該口岸將十分繁忙，請耐心等候過關。為確保公共交通服務暢順，活動期間午夜十二時後，落馬洲／皇崗口岸將按需要設公共交通專用通道，確保皇巴及跨境巴士行車暢通，更有效疏導大量跨境旅客；其他跨境私家車及其乘客輪候過關時間預計會較長。署方已督導相關營辦商預留足夠車輛和人手，應對乘客需求。

運輸署呼籲市民盡量使用公共運輸服務，以避免交通擠塞及不必要的延誤。活動期間，運輸署及警方會密切留意交通情況。警方將視乎當區一帶的人潮及交通情況，在有需要時調整有關交通安排。市民請留意電台、電視台或「香港出行易」流動應用程式發放的最新交通消息。

根據自二○二二年十二月七日起生效的更新遣送政策，入境處一般可在聲請人的司法覆核個案被高等法院原訟法庭拒絕後，執行相關遣送行動，從而提高遣送聲請不獲確立者的效率及加大遣送力度。入境處會繼續加快遣送程序，積極與聲請人主要來源國的政府、航空公司及其他政府部門保持密切聯繫，採取一切合適措施將免遣返聲請不獲確立人士盡快遣離香港，以維持有效的出入境管制和保障公眾利益。"
Immigration Department repatriates 25 unsubstantiated non-refoulement claimants to their places of origin (with photos),2025-08-15 14:54,2025-08-15 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500544.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) carried out repatriation operations on August 13 and 14. A total of 25 unsubstantiated non-refoulement claimants who were overstayers were repatriated to their places of origin. All the persons removed were former foreign domestic helpers. Among them were discharged prisoners who had committed criminal offences and had been sentenced to imprisonment.

  The ImmD is very concerned about the abuse of the non-refoulement claim mechanism and is aware that a number of claimants were former foreign domestic helpers. The ImmD has been co-operating with the relevant consulates-general in Hong Kong and will continue such co-operation to step up publicity and education for newly arriving foreign domestic helpers to help them understand that they should not abuse the non-refoulement claim mechanism.

  Under the updated removal policy effective from December 7, 2022, the ImmD may generally proceed with the removal of a claimant whose judicial review case has been dismissed by the Court of First Instance of the High Court, thereby enhancing the efficiency of and efforts in removing unsubstantiated claimants. The ImmD will remain committed to expediting the removal process and actively maintain close liaison with governments of major source countries of non-refoulement claimants, airline companies and other government departments to repatriate unsubstantiated non-refoulement claimants from Hong Kong as soon as practicable through all appropriate measures to maintain effective immigration control and safeguard the public interest."

EPD launches Non-Plastic Container Trial Programme open for eateries to participate with over 1 000 catering outlets already signed up (with photo),2025-08-15 14:36,2025-08-15 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500486.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (August 15) launched the Non-Plastic Container Trial Programme, openly inviting local catering businesses to participate in the trial use of various types of non-plastic containers and provide feedback on product performance.

  The trial programme has received enthusiastic support from the trade. At present, nearly 100 catering brands (covering more than 1 000 outlets) and nearly 30 tableware suppliers have taken the lead in participating. The trade will collaborate with the Government to further explore going plastic-free in catering operations, working together to achieve the goal of ""Protect the Earth, Use Less Plastic"".

  An EPD spokesman said, ""Plastic is difficult to decompose and can remain in the environment for a very long time. Over time, it can even fragment into microplastics, causing far-reaching harm to the environment and ecology as well as human health. To safeguard the environment and public health, we need to gradually reduce the use of disposable plastic. However, non-plastic container alternatives are still in the developmental stage. While many products are available, they have yet to fully meet all the application needs of the trade.""

  He continued, ""Through the trial programme,participating non-plastic container suppliers will offer discounts to encourage catering businesses to test and gradually expand the use of non-plastic containers based on their circumstances, without having to wait for perfect alternatives to come along. At the same time, more comprehensive data on application could be collected for the improvement of product design and supply chains.""

  The EPD will continue recruiting local catering businesses and non-plastic container suppliers to join the trial programme, testing containers made of different materials (e.g. paper, bamboo pulp, bagasse) and providing feedback based on actual operational scenarios and product performance (e.g. heat resistance, oil resistance, sealing capability). Eateries may also conduct internal testing of new alternatives before applying them at the customer level or carry out phased market trials in selected outlets. There is no need for full-scale adoption at once, and different alternatives may be tested. The EPD will continually consolidate data and industry feedback for reference by catering businesses and tableware suppliers.

  The spokesman emphasised, ""Before further mandating the use of alternatives through legislation, the Government will thoroughly consider the maturity, availability and affordability of the relevant non-plastic alternatives with the goal of aligning environmental protection with industry needs and public acceptance, thereby pragmatically advancing plastic reduction.""

  The EPD calls on the catering sector to actively participate in the trial programme and contribute to environmental protection. For details and enrolment, please visit the Green Tableware Platform website (www.greentableware.hk) or emailsup_hotline@epd.gov.hkfor enquiries. Members of the public and relevant industry stakeholders can also share their experiences with non-plastic containers via the platform, collectively driving improvements in alternative products to expand the market with better plastic-free options."

政務司司長：（有關長者軟餐）因為香港老齡化比較嚴重。我很開心，雖然不是看了很多攤位，看了三數個，但我感受很深，我很讚賞那些軟餐，軟餐對於老人家來說——特別是飲食有困難的——是非常好。以前要做這些軟餐，要在家將食物攪爛，賣相不好，食物選擇也比較少，對於老人家食欲影響很大。剛才你見到百多款（軟餐）食物，賣相就是原本的模樣，吃起來的味道，我試過是一樣的。我覺得食是很重要的，對老人家來說是一種很大的幸福感。

另外到第二檔，我們見到有些很多人都不敢多吃的食物，例如雪糕、月餅，他們用很科學、很健康的方法做出來，多吃也不會影響健康，我覺得這對市民來說是幸福的，起碼有「三高」的人士都可以繼續吃雪糕、月餅，我試過味道是一樣的，成分由很高學歷的、理工大學的博士級研究出來。這些產品非常好，我覺得香港能夠多做推廣，很多產品其實都可以推廣至世界。

另外，剛才這裏亦有些幫老人家做免費體檢，大家不要小看這回事，因為有些老人家可能懶去做或不想去做體檢，未必會特地找醫生做，但若經過、免費，可能他已很嚴重也說不定，替他檢查出來，早些求醫，對其健康也有很大保障。我相信就老齡化方面，剛才我經過的這些都是非常好的產品或服務。

我亦很多謝貿易發展局（TDC），我很鼓勵他們多辦這類展覽，這類展覽除了可以將我們的好產品介紹給香港市民之外，讓市民當作一個景點、旅遊點來走走看看，是很開心的。另外，可以將更多產品推銷出去，或將外國公司——剛才我看到有很多外國公司，例如波蘭等——的產品引進內地也好，引到香港也好，經濟方面，對香港也很有幫助。未來我也很鼓勵貿發局多辦這類展覽，盡量將香港好的產品進行貿易，令香港無論在經濟上也好，各方面也好，特別是香港市民希望有多些幸福感和獲得感。多謝。"

支援計劃將於明年一月一日起擴大服務範圍，除提供現有的口腔檢查、緩解牙齒疼痛的藥物、X光檢查，以及補牙或拔牙服務外，將新增以下服務：洗牙、根管治療（杜牙根）、移除牙橋或牙冠及鑲配活動假牙。

衞生署在今年五月二十六日推出支援計劃，由32個非政府組織於78個服務點為合資格參加者提供服務。截至八月六日，共有1 892名合資格人士已接受資助牙科服務，當中包括2 549次補牙服務和906次拔牙服務，兩者的比例約為三比一，反映支援計劃成功引導服務使用者在牙醫認為合適的情況下保存牙齒，符合政府口腔健康及牙科護理的目標。

支援計劃擴大服務範圍後，如經主診註冊牙醫評估後認為情況合適，每名參加者每365日可獲一次洗牙服務及一顆牙齒的根管治療（杜牙根）。鑲配活動假牙服務方面，每名參加者可接受最多兩次服務，每次須相隔五年或以上。為確保妥善運用有限資源以達致更大成本效益，並讓弱勢社群獲得最具效果的治療服務，鑲配活動假牙服務只提供予剩餘少於20顆牙齒的合資格人士，而這些人士須先獲牙醫評定為有進食或咀嚼困難，並能透過鑲配活動假牙而有效修復進食能力。

同時，支援計劃亦將擴闊受惠對象至無家者，更聚焦地為有需要的弱勢社群提供資助牙科服務。支援計劃將利用非政府組織現有服務無家者的網絡，讓無家者即使未能提供符合參加資格所需的經濟證明，亦可由指定非政府組織的註冊社工作出證明並轉介參加支援計劃。

支援計劃的融資模式以共同承擔的制度為基礎，除了政府資助，參加者亦承擔部分服務成本，管理自身的健康。參加者須向提供服務的非政府組織繳付費用，詳情如下：





洗牙服務或每一顆牙齒的根管治療（杜牙根）

Government enhances Community Dental Support Programme to supplant Community Care Fund Elderly Dental Assistance Programme next year (with photo),2025-08-15 12:40,2025-08-15 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500248.htm,"  The Government announced today (August 15) that the scope of services for the Community Dental Support Programme (CDSP) will be expanded next year to further enhance subsidised preventive and curative dental services for the underprivileged with financial difficulties. The CDSP will also supplant the Community Care Fund Elderly Dental Assistance Programme (EDAP) which will cease to accept applications from January 1 next year.

 The CDSP's scope of services will be expanded with effect from January 1 next year. In addition to providing the existing services of oral health assessments, medication for dental pain relief, X-ray examinations and dental fillings or extractions, new service items, namely dental scalings, root canal treatments, removal of bridges or crowns and removable denture fittings will be introduced.

 The Department of Health (DH) launched the CDSP on May 26 this year with 32 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) providing services to eligible participants at 78 service points. As at August 6, a total of 1 892 eligible persons had received subsidised dental services, which included 2 549 dental fillings and 906 extractions. The ratio of the two is approximately three to one, reflecting that the CDSP has successfully guided service users towards tooth retention when the dentist considers it suitable, aligning with the Government’s initiatives on oral health and dental care.

 After expansion of the CDSP's service scope, subject to the assessment by the attending registered dentist, each participant can receive dental scaling services and a root canal treatment for one tooth every 365 days. Regarding removable denture fittings, each participant can receive the service up to two times, with an interval of at least five years in between. To ensure the proper use of limited resources to achieve greater cost-effectiveness, and to allow the underprivileged to receive the most effective treatment services, the removable dentures fitting service will only be available to eligible persons with fewer than 20 remaining teeth. That person must first be assessed by a dentist as having difficulties in eating or chewing and their eating abilities could be effectively restored by the fitting of removable dentures.

 The CDSP will also expand the beneficiaries list to cover the homeless, further focusing on providing subsidised dental services to the underprivileged in need. The CDSP will make use of the existing network of NGOs that serves the homeless, allowing them to be certified and referred by registered social workers in designated NGOs to participate in the CDSP, even when they are unable to provide the required financial proof to meet the eligibility criteria.

 The CDSP is funded under a co-payment arrangement; apart from Government subsidies, participants have to bear part of the service cost for managing their own health. They are required to pay a fee to the NGO providing the service with details as follows:





Dental scaling or root canal treatment for each tooth
Fitting of removable dentures


Participants of one of the following categories:

			(1) Integrated Home Care Services (Frail Cases) / Enhanced Home and Community Care Services / Home Support Services (Level 1 fee charge or co-payment category) of the Social Welfare Department; or

			(2) Patients of the Hospital Authority (HA) who have been provided Medical Fee Waiver (full waiving) of the HA (including recipients of Old Age Living Allowance aged 75 or above); or

			(3) The homeless
The Government will subsidise the administration fee in full
$500 co-payment fee for each set of removable dentures


Participants who do not fall into the above three categories
$50 administration fee
$1,000 co-payment fee for each set of removable dentures




Remarks: Each set of removable dentures refers to either upper or lower dentures. Fitting both upper and lower removable dentures at the same time is considered receiving the removable dentures fitting service once. Elderly people can make use of Elderly Health Care Vouchers to pay for the administration/co-payment fees under the CDSP.

 For details of the CDSP (including the administration fee of services), please visit the CDSP webpageor call the hotline at 2111 3403. More details about the expanded service scope and beneficiaries will be announced on the webpage in due course.

 Meanwhile, the EDAP will cease accepting applications with effect from January 1 next year. Eligible elders must submit their application for the EDAP through their service unit on or before December 31 this year, and attend the first consultation no later than January 31 next year. The elder can receive dental services under the EDAP if considered necessary and suitable after examination by a dentist. After the EDAP ceases accepting new applications, the CDSP will supplant the EDAP to provide services. The scope of services of the CDSP after the enhancement will be in line with that of the EDAP.

 Information about the EDAP, the list of district service units and Community Care Dentists/Dental Clinics have been uploaded to the Community Care Fund webpage and Hong Kong Dental Association webpage. For enquiries, please call the EDAP hotline at 2525 8198.

 The Government’s oral health policy aims to enable all Hong Kong citizens to enhance their oral hygiene and lifestyles. By adopting the strategies of developing community-wide preventive primary oral healthcare while providing essential dental care services targeting underprivileged groups in formulating the dental services, the Government aims to assist the citizens to put prevention, early identification and timely intervention of dental diseases into action with the objective of tooth retention, thereby further enhancing both oral health and general health levels. Based on the recommendations of the Working Group on Oral Health and Dental Care Final Report, the DH launched the CDSP as an initiative to provide essential dental care services targeting the underprivileged, focusing on providing subsidised preventive and curative dental services to the underprivileged with financial difficulties."

The CDSP will also supplant the Community Care Fund Elderly Dental Assistance Programme (EDAP) which will cease to accept applications from January 1 next year.

 The CDSP's scope of services will be expanded with effect from January 1 next year. In addition to providing the existing services of oral health assessments, medication for dental pain relief, X-ray examinations and dental fillings or extractions, new service items, namely dental scalings, root canal treatments, removal of bridges or crowns and removable denture fittings will be introduced.

 The Department of Health (DH) launched the CDSP on May 26 this year with 32 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) providing services to eligible participants at 78 service points. As at August 6, a total of 1 892 eligible persons had received subsidised dental services, which included 2 549 dental fillings and 906 extractions. The ratio of the two is approximately three to one, reflecting that the CDSP has successfully guided service users towards tooth retention when the dentist considers it suitable, aligning with the Government’s initiatives on oral health and dental care.

 After expansion of the CDSP's service scope, subject to the assessment by the attending registered dentist, each participant can receive dental scaling services and a root canal treatment for one tooth every 365 days. Regarding removable denture fittings, each participant can receive the service up to two times, with an interval of at least five years in between. To ensure the proper use of limited resources to achieve greater cost-effectiveness, and to allow the underprivileged to receive the most effective treatment services, the removable dentures fitting service will only be available to eligible persons with fewer than 20 remaining teeth. That person must first be assessed by a dentist as having difficulties in eating or chewing and their eating abilities could be effectively restored by the fitting of removable dentures.

 The CDSP will also expand the beneficiaries list to cover the homeless, further focusing on providing subsidised dental services to the underprivileged in need. The CDSP will make use of the existing network of NGOs that serves the homeless, allowing them to be certified and referred by registered social workers in designated NGOs to participate in the CDSP, even when they are unable to provide the required financial proof to meet the eligibility criteria.

 The CDSP is funded under a co-payment arrangement; apart from Government subsidies, participants have to bear part of the service cost for managing their own health. They are required to pay a fee to the NGO providing the service with details as follows:





Dental scaling or root canal treatment for each tooth
Fitting of removable dentures


Participants of one of the following categories:

			(1) Integrated Home Care Services (Frail Cases) / Enhanced Home and Community Care Services / Home Support Services (Level 1 fee charge or co-payment category) of the Social Welfare Department; or

			(2) Patients of the Hospital Authority (HA) who have been provided Medical Fee Waiver (full waiving) of the HA (including recipients of Old Age Living Allowance aged 75 or above); or

			(3) The homeless
The Government will subsidise the administration fee in full
$500 co-payment fee for each set of removable dentures


Participants who do not fall into the above three categories
$50 administration fee
$1,000 co-payment fee for each set of removable dentures




Remarks: Each set of removable dentures refers to either upper or lower dentures. Fitting both upper and lower removable dentures at the same time is considered receiving the removable dentures fitting service once. Elderly people can make use of Elderly Health Care Vouchers to pay for the administration/co-payment fees under the CDSP.

 For details of the CDSP (including the administration fee of services), please visit the CDSP webpageor call the hotline at 2111 3403. More details about the expanded service scope and beneficiaries will be announced on the webpage in due course.

 Meanwhile, the EDAP will cease accepting applications with effect from January 1 next year. Eligible elders must submit their application for the EDAP through their service unit on or before December 31 this year, and attend the first consultation no later than January 31 next year. The elder can receive dental services under the EDAP if considered necessary and suitable after examination by a dentist. After the EDAP ceases accepting new applications, the CDSP will supplant the EDAP to provide services. The scope of services of the CDSP after the enhancement will be in line with that of the EDAP.

 Information about the EDAP, the list of district service units and Community Care Dentists/Dental Clinics have been uploaded to the Community Care Fund webpage and Hong Kong Dental Association webpage. For enquiries, please call the EDAP hotline at 2525 8198.

 The Government’s oral health policy aims to enable all Hong Kong citizens to enhance their oral hygiene and lifestyles. By adopting the strategies of developing community-wide preventive primary oral healthcare while providing essential dental care services targeting underprivileged groups in formulating the dental services, the Government aims to assist the citizens to put prevention, early identification and timely intervention of dental diseases into action with the objective of tooth retention, thereby further enhancing both oral health and general health levels. Based on the recommendations of the Working Group on Oral Health and Dental Care Final Report, the DH launched the CDSP as an initiative to provide essential dental care services targeting the underprivileged, focusing on providing subsidised preventive and curative dental services to the underprivileged with financial difficulties."
文化體育及旅遊局局長出席大熊貓龍鳳胎盛大生日派對致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-08-15 12:34,2025-08-15 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500439.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（八月十五日）出席大熊貓龍鳳胎盛大生日派對的致辭全文：

林建岳主席（香港旅遊發展局主席）、龐建貽主席（海洋公園公司董事局主席）、各位來賓、各位今日生日的小朋友、各位傳媒朋友：

大家早晨！今日，好開心能夠與十多位和首對港產大熊貓龍鳳胎加加、得得同年同月同日生的小朋友，以及超過三百位熱愛大熊貓的朋友聚首一堂，慶祝加加和得得及我們小朋友一歲生日的重要時刻。

我們應該還記得，加加和得得出生時體重僅一百多克，放在手掌上都脆弱得驚被吹走。經過一年健康成長，牠們現在體重已超過三十公斤，相當於小學一年級小朋友的體重。過去一年，相信大家和我們一樣，見證着加加和得得健康快樂「暴風式」成長，感到無比喜悅與感動，但是有時又捨不得，就像父母一樣，看着牠們，是否大得有點太快了！加加、得得兩姊弟不論翻筋斗，「瀡樹幹」扮消防員出動，追奶爸奶媽，追他們的靴來咬，還是賴在樹下不肯接受奶爸奶媽「收貓」，都成功融化了無數市民及海內外旅客的心。

去年八月十五日，即是今日，盈盈於自己十九歲生日前一日誕下龍鳳胎，成為全球最年長首次產子的大熊貓。雖然盈盈是新手媽媽，透過海洋公園的實時直播及短片，我們都能看到盈盈在照顧加加和得得時展現出的無比愛心和耐性，從「家姐」、「細佬」初生時為牠們清潔身體和刺激排便，到現在坐定定，一個又一個餵奶，在樹旁引導兩姊弟學習爬樹和推下牠們練習抗跌，都非常熟練認真，絕對是一位一百分的媽媽。明日是盈盈的二十歲生日，對盈盈而言，自己的寶寶能夠健康成長，成為海洋公園大熊貓家庭以至全港市民及旅客帶來歡樂及滿滿的幸福感，相信這是盈盈最珍貴的生日禮物。

除了盈盈，加加和得得健康成長，其實大家不要忘記樂樂。樂樂都是在我們熊貓館旁邊的，爸爸雖然通常都是坐着吃東西，但是大家不要忘記了爸爸。中國大熊貓保護研究中心的專家及海洋公園的護理團隊是我們大熊貓家庭在香港健康愉快成長、生活的幕後功臣。加加和得得的誕生，不僅展現了香港與國家在科研、保育及教育方面的緊密合作成果，也讓市民更加了解並認同國家的保育工作。

為了慶祝加加和得得一歲生日，特區政府聯同香港旅遊發展局及海洋公園，自七月起展開一連串宣傳及慶祝活動，以「召集世界好友暢遊香港賀生日」為主題，透過加加和得得的成長故事，連結本地、內地以至世界各地的朋友一同參與這份屬於香港的喜悅。相信大家都留意到，大熊貓主題街道牌、不同港鐵站的大熊貓裝飾、山頂道花園的大熊貓打卡點等等，已陸續亮相，而大熊貓主題的天星小輪亦已於維多利亞港正式啓航。此外，海洋公園正在舉行的「LABUBU x Panda Twins日日獎」活動廣受市民和旅客歡迎。今日大熊貓的生日及未來兩日，我們還會加碼抽出更多由「LABUBU之父」龍家昇先生專誠為慶祝大熊貓龍鳳胎一歲生日而特別設計的限量版LABUBU。稍後，大家到訪海洋公園，記得參加抽獎，祝大家好運！

最後，讓我們再次祝賀加加、得得，及在場每一位今日生日的一歲小朋友們生日快樂、快高長大，開開心心，亦祝願每位參與生日慶典的來賓有一個愉快及難忘的體驗。多謝大家。"
Public Health and Municipal Services (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 to come into effect on August 17,2025-08-15 12:00,2025-08-15 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500306.htm," The Public Health and Municipal Services (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 was gazetted on May 16 and will come into effect on August 17.

 The Amendment Ordinance strengthens the statutory power of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) to deal with various environmental hygiene problems, enabling it to handle problems such as water seepage in buildings, water dripping from air-conditioners, the occupation of public places by miscellaneous articles, and shopfront extension more effectively.

 A spokesman for the Environment and Ecology Bureau said, ""The Government is committed to enhancing Hong Kong's environmental hygiene and cityscape. The Amendment Ordinance, along with various administrative measures and public education, can continuously improve Hong Kong'senvironmental hygiene, consolidate the achievements made so far and create a more liveable environment in response to the expectations of the public.

 ""In the past three months, the FEHD has enhanced publicity and education to raise the awareness of members of the public and relevant sectors of the new legal requirement and arrangements as well as to enhance their law-abiding awareness.""

 The Amendment Ordinance extends the hours during which public officers are allowed to enter premises to deal with public health nuisances such as water seepage in buildings and water dripping from air-conditioners to 7am to 10pm. Without reasonable excuse, failing to allow a public officer to enter the premises within 14 days after the issuance or attachment of the Notice of Intended Entry by the FEHD is an offence that may be liable to a maximum penalty of a fine at level 2 ($5,000).

 When dealing with vermin problems in private premises, according to the Amendment Ordinance, the FEHD can issue a Notice of Elimination of Vermin to a person responsible for the management of the premises (e.g. owners' corporations and property management companies) regarding the common parts of the premises, allowing timely handling of vermin in common parts of a building. The maximum penalty for non-compliance with a Notice of Elimination of Vermin will be raised from the current fine at level 2 ($5,000) and a daily fine of $100, to level 4 ($25,000) and a daily fine of $450. In cases where the FEHD has conducted vermin disinfestation work for infested premises without serving a Notice of Elimination of Vermin, the department may recover the expense incurred from the responsible person of the concerned premises. Apart from that, the Amendment Ordinance has raised the maximum penalty from the existing fine at level 1 ($2,000) to a fine at level 2 ($5,000) for tampering with devices set up by the FEHD to destroy and remove vermin; the Amendment Ordinance has also stipulated that the FEHD can place devices and equipment in premises infested with vermin for conducting tests or assessing vermin proliferation. It will be an offence to tamper with such devices and equipment subject to a maximum penalty of a fine at level 2 ($5,000).

 Regarding the occupation of public places by miscellaneous articles causing obstruction to scavenging operations, the Amendment Ordinance shortens the removal time specified on the Notice to Remove Obstruction to a period of not less than 30 minutes. The FEHD can exercise discretion by setting a reasonably longer time according to the actual circumstances. The maximum penalty for obstruction to scavenging operations will be raised from a fine at level 2 ($5,000) and a daily fine of $50 to level 3 ($10,000) and a daily fine of $300.

 The Amendment Ordinance also empowers enforcement officers to remove and dispose of display equipment like easy-mount frames, apart from bills or posters. The maximum penalty for illegal display or affixation of bills or posters has also been raised from a fine at level 3 ($10,000) and a daily fine of $300 to level 4 ($25,000) and a daily fine of $450.

  Furthermore, the Amendment Ordinance will introduce an offence targeting shopfront extension in the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132), empowering the FEHD to remove the obstructing articles constituting unlawful shopfront extension without the need to rely on the power of the Hong Kong Police Force to enhance enforcement efficiency. In cases where no claim is made for the article not of a perishable nature within seven days after the date of the exercise of the power of removal, or within 48 hours for the article of perishable nature, the article will be forfeited. The law enforcement criteria and penalty (maximum penalty of a fine at level 4 ($25,000) and three months' imprisonment) for the offence of shopfront extension remain unchanged. The FEHD can issue fixed penalty notices of $6,000 to offenders.

 In light of the related amendments, the Secretary for Environment and Ecology today (August 15) amended the format of the penalty notice in accordance with Section 17A of the Fixed Penalty (Public Cleanliness and Obstruction) Ordinance (Cap. 570), adding the offence of shopfront extension of Cap. 132 accordingly. Specified forms of the concerned penalty notices are gazetted today and will come into effect on the same day as the Amendment Ordinance on August 17.

 The FEHD has presented on its webpage the information of the Amendment Ordinance for public reference."
環保署推出「非塑膠容器試驗計劃」公開招募食肆參與　逾千間餐飲店率先響應（附圖）,2025-08-15 12:00,2025-08-15 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081400766.htm,"​環境保護署（環保署）今日（八月十五日）推出「非塑膠容器試驗計劃」，公開招募本地餐飲業界試用各類非塑膠容器，並就產品的功能表現提供意見。

試驗計劃獲業界踴躍支持，現時已有近百個餐飲品牌（涵蓋逾一千間分店）和近三十家餐具供應商率先參與。業界將與政府共同探索在餐飲業務中進一步走塑，攜手實踐「愛護地球 用少啲塑膠」的目標。

環保署發言人表示：「塑膠難以分解，可在環境中殘留極長的時間，更加會破碎成為微塑膠，對環境生態以至人類健康均可以造成深遠的傷害。為了保護環境和市民健康，我們需要逐步減少使用即棄塑膠。只是現時非塑膠容器替代品還在發展中階段，雖然有不少產品，但還未能完全滿足業界所有的應用場景需要。」

他續說：「透過試驗計劃，參與的非塑膠容器供應商將提供優惠，鼓勵餐飲業界試行並按各自情況逐步擴大使用非塑膠容器，無需等待完美替代品的出現，同時收集更全面的應用數據，協助優化產品設計和供應鏈。」

環保署會持續招募本地餐飲業界和非塑膠容器供應商加入試驗計劃，參與試用不同材質（如紙、竹漿、甘蔗渣等）的非塑膠容器，並按不同場景的實際運作情況和產品表現（如耐溫、耐油、密封性能等）提供意見。食肆亦可以就首次試用的替代品，在顧客層面實際應用前先進行內部測試，或在個別店舖按情況進行逐步的市場測試，無需要一次過全部採用替代品，也可以試用不同的替代品。環保署會持續整合數據和業界意見，供餐飲業界和餐具供應商參考。

發言人強調：「在立法進一步強制使用替代品前，政府會充分考慮相關非塑膠替代品的成熟度、普及性和可負擔性，以保護環境、符合業界需要，和市民接受為目標，務實推進減少使用塑膠。」

環保署呼籲餐飲業界踴躍參與試驗計劃，為環保出一分力。有關計劃詳情和參加方法，請瀏覽「綠色餐具平台」網站（www.greentableware.hk），或電郵至sup_hotline@epd.gov.hk查詢。市民和相關業界人士亦可透過有關平台分享非塑膠容器的使用體驗，共同推動替代品的質素改善，讓市場上有更多更好的走塑選擇。"

《2025年公眾衞生及市政（修訂）條例》將於八月十七日生效,2025-08-15 12:00,2025-08-15 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500303.htm,"《2025年公眾衞生及市政（修訂）條例》（《修訂條例》）已於五月十六日於憲報刊登，並將於八月十七日生效。

《修訂條例》加強食物環境衞生署（食環署）處理多項環境衞生問題的法定權力，可更有效地處理樓宇滲水、冷氣機滴水、雜物霸佔公眾地方和店鋪阻街等問題。

環境及生態局發言人表示：「政府銳意提升本港環境衞生和市容。《修訂條例》配合各項行政措施和公眾教育，有助持續改善香港的環境衞生、鞏固至今的工作成效和構建更宜居的生活環境，以回應市民的期望。」

「食環署已在過去三個月加強宣傳和教育，讓公眾和相關業界知悉新的法例要求和安排，提高其守法意識。」

《修訂條例》賦權公職人員在處理樓宇滲水、冷氣機滴水等公共衞生妨擾問題時，可進入涉事處所的時段延長至上午七時至下午十時；如無合理辯解，而沒有在食環署發‍出或張貼擬‍進入處所通‍知書後的14日內讓公職人員進入該處‍所進行調查，即屬違法，可處以最高第2級罰款（即5,000元）。

在處理私人處所的蟲鼠問題方面，食環署可根據《修訂條例》向負責管理處所的人（例如業主立案法團或物業管理公司）就公用部分發出消除蟲鼠通知，以讓建築物公用部分的蟲鼠問題能獲適時處理。不遵從消除蟲鼠通知的最高罰則將由第2級（$5,000）和每日$100提高至第4級罰款（$25,000）和每日$450。如食環署未有發出消除蟲鼠通知但需要為處所進行消除蟲鼠工作，該署可向涉事處所的負責人追討有關開支。此外，《修訂條例》提高干擾食環署用作消滅和除去蟲鼠器材的最高罰則，由第1級罰款（$2,000）提高至第2級罰款（$5,000），並訂明食環署可於受蟲鼠侵擾的處所設置器材或儀器，以測試或評估蟲鼠滋生情況；而干擾相關器材或儀器屬於違法行為，最高可被處以第2級罰款（$5,000）。

就雜物霸佔公眾地方以致妨礙垃圾清掃，《修訂條例》把移走障礙物通知書所指明的移走物品期限縮短至不少於30分鐘；食環署可因應實際情況，酌情指明較長而合理的期限。妨礙垃圾清掃的最高罰則會由第2級罰款（$5,000）及每日$50提高至第3級罰款（$10,000）及每日$300。

《修訂條例》亦賦權執法人員除可移除招貼或海報外，亦可以移除和處置「易拉架」等展示設備，同時把非法展示或張貼招貼或海報的最高罰則，由第3級罰款（$10,000）和每日$300提高至第4級罰款（$25,000）和每日$450。

此外，《修訂條例》亦會在《公眾衞生及市政條例》（第132章）加入店鋪阻街的罪行，賦權食環署可以移除涉嫌構成店鋪阻街的物品等，無須借助警方的權力，以提高執法效率。如果在行使移走權力的日期後7日內沒有人對非易毀消性質的物品，或在行使移走權力後的48小時內沒有人對易毀消性質的物品提出申索，則該物品將被沒收。店鋪阻街罪行現時的執法準則和罰則（最高刑罰第4級罰款（$25,000）和三個月監禁）將維持不變，食環署可向違例者發出6,000元的定額罰款通知書。

因應相關修訂，環境及生態局局長今日（八月十五日）根據《定額罰款（公眾地方潔淨及阻礙）條例》（第570章）第17A條的權力修訂定額罰款的格式，相應加入第132章的店鋪阻街罪行。相關通知書的指明格式於今日刊憲，並將在八月十七日與《修訂條例》同日生效。

食環署已在其網站載列《修訂條例》的資訊，供市民參閱。"
政務司副司長出席全國生態日啓動禮暨研討會致辭（只有中文）,2025-08-15 11:20,2025-08-15 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500332.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（八月十五日）出席全國生態日啓動禮暨研討會的致辭：

尊敬的葉水球副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室教育科技部副部長）、李慧琼常委（第十四屆全國人民代表大會常務委員會委員和立法會議員）、成嶂旻副局長（深圳市海洋發展局副局長）、謝展寰局長（環境及生態局局長）、林正財醫生（行政會議成員、碳中和及可持續發展委員會主席）、各位立法會議員、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

早晨！歡迎各位今日參加第三屆全國生態日啓動禮暨研討會，與我們一齊就生態文明理念和保育工作進行交流。

二○二三年，十四屆全國人大常委會第三次會議通過決定，將八月十五日設定為全國生態日，以深化國家生態文明思想的大眾化傳播，提高全社會生態文明意識。今年全國生態日適逢習近平主席提出該理念20周年，意義更為特別。透過舉辦全國生態日啓動禮及相關活動，我們希望增強香港社會對生態環境保護的思想與行動自覺，實踐習主席提出「綠水青山就是金山銀山」的理念。

特區政府高度重視國家生態文明的倡議。為此，我們一直致力推動社會綠色轉型、保育生態，並加強與內地合作，建設美麗中國、美麗香港。在跨境協作方面，過去兩年，內地與特區政府簽訂了多份合作協議，涵蓋保育后海灣一帶的濕地生境、推進深圳梧桐山—香港紅花嶺生態廊道的建設，以及加強兩地污染治理、應對氣候變化和生態宣傳教育工作的合作。今日稍後，港深雙方將在啓動禮上簽署《大型水生野生動物聯合救護機制工作備忘錄》，深化兩地大型水生野生動物救護協作。

在綠色轉型方面，為配合國家「3060」的雙碳目標—即力爭在二○三○年實現碳達峰、二○六○年前實現碳中和—我們正穩步推進《香港氣候行動藍圖2050》訂下的四大主要減碳策略，即「淨零發電」、「節能綠建」、「綠色運輸」和「全民減廢」，以實現特區政府在二○三五年前將碳排放量從二○○五年的水平減半，並於二○五○年前實現碳中和的目標。

我們目前已取得階段性成果。香港的碳排放總量自二○一四年達峰後已呈下降趨勢，二○二三年的溫室氣體排放總量與二○一四年比較已下降約四分之一；人均溫室氣體排放量亦降至約4.58 公噸，比二○一四年下降接近三成，此排放量約是美國的四分之一及歐盟的六成。

在生態保育方面，我們持續加強保育高生態價值的陸地和海洋。去年，我們成立了三個與生態保育相關的公園，包括：第25個郊野公園，即紅花嶺郊野公園；第八個兼面積最大的海岸公園，即北大嶼海岸公園；以及結合濕地保育、農耕作業與自然教育於一身的塱原自然生態公園。展望未來，政府將在北部都會區設立總面積超過300公頃的三寶樹濕地保育公園，結合濕地保育、康樂旅遊和漁農業發展，不但提升后海灣一帶生境質素和生物多樣性，亦會推動水產養殖業現代化，及為市民提供優質的生態教育及康樂體驗，締造保育與發展並行。

我們會繼續善用香港山海都市近在咫尺的特質，拓展生態旅遊。由我擔任組長的發展旅遊熱點工作組於今年五月公布了「四山」旅遊項目，提出加強優化相關山徑設施、旅遊行程規劃及宣傳推廣，推動可持續綠色旅遊及優質自然生態體驗。

另外，我們會在推展鄉郊保育的過程中，尋找合適切入點揉合藝術元素，以嶄新鄉郊體驗吸引遊人帶動鄉村復興。稍後時間，鄉郊保育辦公室和漁農自然護理署的同事會和大家分享他們如何在工作中應用創新和藝術元素。

就今屆的全國生態日，特區政府聯同超過30個非政府機構在未來兩星期推出多項特別活動及優惠，包括免費開放設施、提供免費生態導賞團、夜間導賞、舉辦工作坊和講座、派發紀念品及在「綠在區區」設施以優惠積分兌換心儀禮品等。我在此對各機構的積極參與，表示衷心感謝。

生態保育與我們的生活息息相關。不減低碳排放量、不實現雙碳目標包括碳中和，我們不能做到「綠水青山就是金山銀山」；反之，我們得到的，是地球變暖的惡果，包括在全球日益頻繁出現的極端天氣。所以，我呼籲市民踴躍參加與生態日有關的各項活動。

尊敬的葉水球副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室教育科技部副部長）、李慧琼常委（第十四屆全國人民代表大會常務委員會委員和立法會議員）、成嶂旻副局長（深圳市海洋發展局副局長）、謝展寰局長（環境及生態局局長）、林正財醫生（行政會議成員、碳中和及可持續發展委員會主席）、各位立法會議員、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

早晨！歡迎各位今日參加第三屆全國生態日啓動禮暨研討會，與我們一齊就生態文明理念和保育工作進行交流。

二○二三年，十四屆全國人大常委會第三次會議通過決定，將八月十五日設定為全國生態日，以深化國家生態文明思想的大眾化傳播，提高全社會生態文明意識。今年全國生態日適逢習近平主席提出該理念20周年，意義更為特別。透過舉辦全國生態日啓動禮及相關活動，我們希望增強香港社會對生態環境保護的思想與行動自覺，實踐習主席提出「綠水青山就是金山銀山」的理念。

特區政府高度重視國家生態文明的倡議。為此，我們一直致力推動社會綠色轉型、保育生態，並加強與內地合作，建設美麗中國、美麗香港。在跨境協作方面，過去兩年，內地與特區政府簽訂了多份合作協議，涵蓋保育后海灣一帶的濕地生境、推進深圳梧桐山—香港紅花嶺生態廊道的建設，以及加強兩地污染治理、應對氣候變化和生態宣傳教育工作的合作。今日稍後，港深雙方將在啓動禮上簽署《大型水生野生動物聯合救護機制工作備忘錄》，深化兩地大型水生野生動物救護協作。

在綠色轉型方面，為配合國家「3060」的雙碳目標—即力爭在二○三○年實現碳達峰、二○六○年前實現碳中和—我們正穩步推進《香港氣候行動藍圖2050》訂下的四大主要減碳策略，即「淨零發電」、「節能綠建」、「綠色運輸」和「全民減廢」，以實現特區政府在二○三五年前將碳排放量從二○○五年的水平減半，並於二○五○年前實現碳中和的目標。

目前，我們已取得階段性成果。香港的碳排放總量自二○一四年達峰後已呈下降趨勢，二○二三年的溫室氣體排放總量與二○一四年比較已下降約四分之一；人均溫室氣體排放量亦降至約4.58 公噸，比二○一四年下降接近三成，此排放量約是美國的四分之一及歐盟的六成。

在生態保育方面，我們持續加強保育高生態價值的陸地和海洋。去年，我們成立了三個與生態保育相關的公園，包括：第25個郊野公園，即紅花嶺郊野公園；第八個兼面積最大的海岸公園，即北大嶼海岸公園；以及結合濕地保育、農耕作業與自然教育於一身的塱原自然生態公園。展望未來，政府將在北部都會區設立總面積超過300公頃的三寶樹濕地保育公園，結合濕地保育、康樂旅遊和漁農業發展，不但提升后海灣一帶生境質素和生物多樣性，亦會推動水產養殖業現代化，及為市民提供優質的生態教育及康樂體驗，締造保育與發展並行。

我們會繼續善用香港山海都市近在咫尺的特質，拓展生態旅遊。由我擔任組長的發展旅遊熱點工作組於今年五月公布了「四山」旅遊項目，提出加強優化相關山徑設施、旅遊行程規劃及宣傳推廣，推動可持續綠色旅遊及優質自然生態體驗。

另外，我們會在推展鄉郊保育的過程中，尋找合適切入點揉合藝術元素，以嶄新鄉郊體驗吸引遊人帶動鄉村復興。稍後時間，鄉郊保育辦公室和漁農自然護理署的同事會和大家分享他們如何在工作中應用創新和藝術元素。

就今屆的全國生態日，特區政府聯同超過30個非政府機構在未來兩星期推出多項特別活動及優惠，包括免費開放設施、提供免費生態導賞團、夜間導賞、舉辦工作坊和講座、派發紀念品及在「綠在區區」設施讓參與者以優惠積分兌換心儀禮品等。我在此對各機構的積極參與，表示衷心感謝。

生態保育與我們的生活息息相關。不減低碳排放量、不實現雙碳目標包括碳中和，我們不能做到「綠水青山就是金山銀山」；反之，我們得到的，是地球變暖的惡果，包括在全球日益頻繁出現的極端天氣。所以，我呼籲市民踴躍參加與生態日有關的各項活動。

今屆全國生態日的一系列活動能夠成功舉辦，我感謝環境及自然保育基金的資助和環境運動委員會的支持；我亦感謝各非政府機構、學術團體、香港理工大學，以及各位來自內地及香港的專家學者的參與。希望各位嘉賓及廣大市民能從今年全國生態日的活動得到裨益，亦祝在座各位身體健康、生活愉快。多謝大家。"

The Board ordered the RGBC to be reprimanded and to pay a total of $88,400, being the costs of the Board and the Buildings Department (BD) for conducting the inquiry.

The Board's written decision and order issued on August 7 was published in the Gazette today (August 15). Details are available at the following link: www.gld.gov.hk/egazette/pdf/20252933/egn202529334997.pdf.

The case involved a fatal incident that occurred at a construction site in Tung Chung on June 29, 2019. A worker was struck by a toppled pile of aluminum panels while he was handling the panels. The worker was seriously injured and was certified dead at the hospital. The RGBC was prosecuted by the Labour Department for violation of the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance. The RGBC was convicted and fined $10,000 at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on January 3, 2022.

In view of the conviction of the RGBC, the BD notified the Board for its consideration of disciplinary action against the RGBC under the provisions of section 13(1) of the BO.

A spokesperson for the BD reiterated that any registered contractor who is convicted by any court of an offence relating to building works, or has been negligent or has misconducted himself in building works, may be subject to disciplinary action under the BO."

鑑於有關定罪，屋宇署遂根據《建築物條例》第13（1）條的規定，通知紀律委員會考慮向該承建商採取紀律行動。

屋宇署發言人重申，根據《建築物條例》，若註冊承建商就建築工程有關的罪行被法庭定罪，或在建築工程方面犯有疏忽或行為不當，該承建商可被紀律處分。"

HKSAR Government strongly disapproves and rejects US report on human rights,2025-08-14 21:13,2025-08-14 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400965.htm,"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government today (August 14) strongly disapproves and rejects the unfounded and biased content related to Hong Kong contained in the United States (US) Department of State's so-called 2024 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.

A HKSAR Government spokesperson said, ""the HKSAR Government strongly disapproves and rejects the US' repeated tactics through the so-called report in making slandering remarks against Hong Kong, where 'one country, two systems' is successfully implemented. The US is once again overriding the rule of law with politics and politicising human rights issues. Such attempt to interfere in Hong Kong's law-based governance and undermine the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong is doomed to fail.""

""Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, human rights of Hong Kong residents have been firmly protected by the Constitution and the Basic Law. The HKSAR Government resolutely, fully and faithfully implement the Hong Kong National Security Law, the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance and other relevant laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, to effectively prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law, whilst maintaining the common law system, adhering to the principle of the rule of law and upholding the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents in accordance with the law, so as to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of the principle of 'one country, two systems'. The HKSAR Government strongly demands the US to immediately stop acting against international law and the basic norms of international relations and interfering in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs.""

On legislation safeguarding national security, the spokesperson pointed out, ""the content regarding legislation safeguarding national security in the HKSAR contained in the so-called report by the US are completely absurd and untrue. Since the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law in June 2020, the US has all along ignored the large-scale and incessant riots that occurred in 2019 which devastated the society, livelihood and economy of Hong Kong. Instead, it built up false stories and fabricated narratives through various so-called reports to maliciously slander legislation safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and blatantly attack the HKSAR in safeguarding national security dutifully, faithfully and in accordance with the law. The US has also deliberately neglected the fact that such laws have enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community, as well as the business environment, to return to normalcy. Its bullying conduct and hypocrisy laced with double standards are utterly despicable.""

""The legal framework in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR is consistent with the relevant international human rights standards. The Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security. The rights and freedoms, including the freedom of expression, press freedom, freedom of assembly and of association, freedom of academic research, literary and artistic creation and other cultural activities etc, enjoyed by Hong Kong residents under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to the HKSAR are to be protected in accordance with the law. In addition, the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance also clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security, including the principles of conviction and punishment only by the application of the law, the presumption of innocence, the prohibition of double jeopardy, and the right to defend oneself and other rights in judicial proceedings that a criminal suspect, defendant and other parties in judicial proceedings are entitled to under the law.""

""Like all other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. The enjoyment of these rights has limits so as not to affect adversely to an unacceptable level the enjoyment by other members of their community of their rights and liberties. Journalists, like everyone else, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. Their freedom of commenting on and criticising government policies remains uninhibited as long as they do not violate the law.""

""The offences endangering national security stipulated by the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance target acts endangering national security with precision, and define the elements and penalties of the offences with clarity. The prosecution has the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant has the actus reus and mens rea of an offence before the defendant may be convicted by the court. Moreover, the relevant offences do not have retrospective effect, which is in line with Article 12 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights.""

""As a matter of fact, each and every sovereign state enacts laws safeguarding national security. This is not only their inherent right, but also an international practice. The US has at least 21 pieces of laws safeguarding national security. It is therefore in no position to point its finger at other countries and regions for legitimately legislating to safeguard national security.""

""Reasonable and legitimate expression of opinion based on objective facts and legitimate day-to-day activities would not constitute an offence. Whether it be offences under the Hong Kong National Security Law or other offences endangering national security under the laws of the HKSAR, they only target an extremely small minority of organisations and individuals endangering national security.""

As for enforcement actions, the HKSAR Government's spokesperson reiterated that, ""the HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, and have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation.""

""Like law enforcement agencies around the world, the HKSAR's law enforcement agencies released information of fugitive offenders who are suspected to have committed serious offences and are wanted, and appealed for the public's assistance in bringing fugitive offenders to justice. This is legitimate, necessary, and squarely in line with international practice. The US often abuses 'long-arm jurisdiction' and unilateral sanctions to target citizens of other countries. Its smears on the HKSAR's enforcement actions taken in accordance with the law are simply untenable.""

""On bail arrangement, the cardinal importance of safeguarding national security and preventing and suppressing acts endangering national security explains why the Hong Kong National Security Law introduces more stringent conditions to the grant of bail in relation to offences endangering national security. Some jurisdictions have even put in place regimes that authorise prolonged detention on national security grounds without charge, depending on the specific circumstances of the case. The content against the implementation of the arrangement mentioned in the so-called report by the US are nothing but unreasonable smears.""

On safeguarding the due administration of justice and the rule of law, the HKSAR Government spokesperson reiterated that, ""Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law and has always adhered to the principle that laws must be obeyed and lawbreakers be held accountable. The HKSAR's judicial system is highly regarded by the international community. The HKSAR Judiciary exercises judicial power independently in accordance with the law, free from any interference. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to a fair hearing.""

In response to the false information in the so-called report by the US on the conditions of correctional services facilities, the HKSAR Government spokesperson said, ""the Correctional Services Department (CSD) is committed to providing a secure, safe, humane, decent and healthy custodial environment for persons in custody (PICs). The rights of PICs are safeguarded through a system of regular visits by independent visitors, namely Justices of the Peace (JPs), who are vested with the statutory duties to inspect the prisons once or twice every month. PICs may approach visiting JPs or lodge complaints through other channels including the CSD's Complaints Investigation Unit, the Ombudsman, etc. All complaints by PICs will be handled in an open, fair and just manner.""

""In the interests of a particular prisoner or for the maintenance of good order and discipline, the Commissioner of Correctional Services is empowered to make arrangements under section 68B of the Prison Rules that such prisoner should not associate with other prisoners (i.e. the so-called 'solitary confinement'). One of the purposes of the relevant arrangement is to ensure the personal safety and well-being of the PICs, which can be requested by the PICs themselves and approved by the Commissioner after considering the matter in accordance with the law; or the Commissioner may make such arrangements after considering the relevant factors in accordance with the legal requirements and procedures.""

Regarding the false information regarding deportation policy in the so-called report by the US, the HKSAR Government spokesperson said that, ""The HKSAR Government maintains a firm policy of not granting asylum and not determining or recognising refugee status of any person. A Unified Screening Mechanism (USM) has been put in place to screen non-refoulement claims on all applicable grounds in one go. The procedures of the USM meet the high standards of fairness as required by law and compare most favourably with those adopted in other common law jurisdictions. Each non-refoulement claimant is also provided with publicly-funded legal assistance.""

""At present, the Immigration Department (ImmD) can generally handle each new non-refoulement claim received instantly, and the Torture Claims Appeal Board has streamlined its processes to improve efficiency in handling appeal cases, with the appeal processing time drastically reduced to around four months. Moreover, the Judiciary has been proactively implementing a host of measures to ensure that non-refoulement claim related cases are handled as expeditiously as reasonably practicable, including increasing manpower to handle the growing number of cases, streamlining the relevant court procedures to enhance efficiency, etc.""

""Non-refoulement claimants have no lawful status to stay in Hong Kong. Regardless of the outcome of their non-refoulement claims, claimants are not permitted to remain legally in Hong Kong and they have no right to work in Hong Kong. In those circumstances where it is necessary to detain non-refoulement claimants in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions, legal principles established by the Court and the prevailing detention policy, they are provided with adequate facilities. The HKSAR Government also provides humanitarian assistance to them for sustaining their livelihood in Hong Kong. At present, Hong Kong has three detention facilities offering a total of 940 places for detaining non-refoulement claimants, which accounts for about 6 per cent of some 15 800 claimants. The said report which stated approximately 8 700 were held in immigration facilities is seriously inconsistent with the facts.""

Moreover, according to the HKSAR Government's updated removal policy, ImmD will proceed with the removal of unsubstantiated claimants from Hong Kong upon dismissal of their judicial review or relevant leave applications pertaining to their non-refoulement claims by the Court of First Instance (CFI) of the High Court, irrespective of whether there are outstanding court proceedings (including appeals lodged to the higher courts against the decisions of the CFI). The courts have also affirmed that the HKSAR Government's updated removal policy is lawful and reasonable.""

The HKSAR Government spokesperson reiterated that, ""the HKSAR steadfastly safeguards national sovereignty, security and development interests, and fully and faithfully lives up to this top priority of 'one country, two systems'. With the strong support from the motherland, and as the only city where the global advantage and the China advantage converge under 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong will continue to protect and promote human rights through security, development and co-operation, as well as to tell good stories of the HKSAR's human rights situation in a reasoned and robust manner."""
特區政府強烈不滿和反對美國人權報告,2025-08-14 21:12,2025-08-14 21:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400963.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（八月十四日）就美國國務院所謂二○二四年度人權報告中有關香港的不實和偏頗內容，表示強烈不滿和反對。

特區政府發言人表示：「特區政府強烈不滿和反對美國重施故技，通過所謂報告，肆意詆毀『一國兩制』成功實踐下的香港。美國一再以政治凌駕法治，將人權問題政治化，企圖干預香港依法施政、破壞香港繁榮穩定，注定以失敗告終。」

「自香港回歸祖國以來，香港居民的人權受《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實保障。特區政府堅定不移全面準確實施《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》及香港特區其他維護國家安全的相關法律，依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，同時維持普通法制度、堅持法治原則、依法保障香港居民的權利和自由，確保『一國兩制』實踐行穩致遠。特區政府強烈要求美國立即停止不符合國際法和國際關係基本準則的行為，立即停止干涉中國內政和香港事務。」

在維護國家安全相關法律方面，特區政府發言人指出：「美國所謂報告中針對香港特區維護國家安全相關法律的內容，全然無稽失實。自《香港國安法》在二○二○年六月實施以來，美國一直漠視香港在二○一九年發生的大型、持續、重創香港社會民生經濟、無日無之的暴亂，通過不同的所謂報告堆砌故事、穿鑿附會，惡意詆毀香港特區維護國家安全相關法律，對盡責、忠誠和依法維護國家安全的香港特區肆意攻擊，而對《香港國安法》讓廣大香港居民生活和經濟活動回復正常、營商環境恢復的實況置若罔聞，其霸凌和『雙標』的虛偽面目和行徑表露無遺。」

「香港特區維護國家安全的法律框架，與相關國際人權標準一致。《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》，均明確規定維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，亦依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》，以及《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港特區的有關規定下享有的權利和自由，包括發表自由、新聞自由、集會和結社自由的權利以及學術研究、文學藝術創作和其他文化活動的自由等。同時，《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》亦明確訂明，防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪時，應當堅持法治原則，包括罪刑法定、無罪推定、一事不再審等原則，並保障犯罪嫌疑人、被告人和其他訴訟參與人依法享有的辯護權和其他訴訟權利。」

「與世界其他地方一樣，有關權利和自由並非絕對。為使社會上其他人的權利和自由不會受到不可接受的影響，行使這些權利需要有限制。新聞從業員與其他人一樣都有義務遵守所有法律。只要不違法，傳媒評論及批評政府施政的自由並無受到限制。」

「《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》訂明的危害國家安全的罪行，精準針對危害國家安全的行為，清楚訂明構成有關罪行的元素和刑罰。控方有責任在毫無合理疑點下證明被告人有相關的犯罪行為和犯罪意圖，被告人才可被法庭定罪。此外，相關罪行不會有追溯力，符合《香港人權法案》第12條的規定。」

「事實上，每個主權國都會制定維護國家安全法律，這既是主權國家的固有權利，也是國際慣例。在維護國家安全方面的法律，美國就最少有21部，根本沒有資格對其他國家和地區就正當維護國家安全立法指手畫腳。」

「合理和正當地基於客觀事實發表的言論和正當的日常活動，不會構成罪行。不論是《香港國安法》下的罪行，抑或是香港特區法律下的其他危害國家安全罪行，都只是針對極少部分的危害國家安全的組織和個人。」

至於執法工作方面，特區政府發言人重申：「香港特區執法部門根據證據、嚴格依照法律，以及按有關個人或單位的行為採取所有執法行動，與政治立場、背景或職業無關。」

「與世界上其他執法部門一樣，香港特區執法部門公開因涉嫌犯下嚴重罪行而被通緝的逃犯資料，並要求市民大眾協助緝拿逃犯歸案，有關做法合法和實屬必要，亦符合國際慣例。美國經常對別國公民濫施『長臂管轄』、單邊制裁，其對香港特區依法進行執法行動的抹黑，根本站不住腳。」

「就保釋安排而言，維護國家安全，以及防範和制止危害國家安全的行為極為重要，此解釋了為何《香港國安法》對涉及危害國家安全的罪行引入更嚴格的保釋條件。有一些司法管轄區甚至設有機制，可以國家安全為由，因應案件的具體情況准許未經起訴而長時間拘留。美國所謂報告中針對有關安排實施的內容屬無理抹黑。」

在維護司法公正和法治精神方面，特區政府發言人重申：「香港是法治社會，一直秉持有法必依、違法必究的原則。香港特區司法制度深得國際社會推崇。香港特區司法機關依法獨立進行審判，不受任何干涉，而所有面對刑事指控的人都享有接受公平審訊的權利。」

就美國所謂報告中有關懲教院所情況的不實內容，特區政府發言人表示：「懲教署致力為在囚人士提供穩妥、安全、人道、合適和健康的羈管環境。獨立訪客（即太平紳士）定期巡視的安排確保在囚人士的權利獲得保障，太平紳士獲賦予每月巡視監獄一次或兩次的法定職責。在囚人士可向巡獄太平紳士或循其他途徑作出申訴，包括懲教署投訴調查組、申訴專員公署等。所有在囚人士作出的投訴都會獲公平、公開和公正的處理。」

「為某囚犯的利益或為維持秩序或紀律，懲教署署長根據《監獄規例》第68B條可作出有關囚犯不應與其他囚犯交往的安排（即所謂的『單獨監禁』）。有關安排的其中一個目的是保障囚犯的人身安全和福祉，可由該囚犯自行提出要求、由懲教署署長依法考慮後審批，或由懲教署署長根據法律規定及程序，在考量了相關的因素後而作出。」

就美國所謂報告中有關遣送政策的不實內容，特區政府發言人表示：「特區政府一貫採取堅定政策，不會給予任何人庇護，亦不會決定或確認任何人為難民。已實施的『統一審核機制』會一次過以所有適用的理由審核免遣返聲請。『統一審核機制』的程序符合法律要求的高度公平標準，並且與其他普通法司法管轄區相比更為完善。每位聲請人亦會獲得公費法律支援。」

「目前，入境處一般可即時處理接獲的免遣返聲請個案，而酷刑聲請上訴委員會亦已精簡程序，將處理上訴時間大幅減至約四個月。此外，司法機構一直積極採取多項措施以確保在合理可行的情況下，盡快處理與免遣返聲請有關的案件，包括增加人手處理與日俱增的個案，以及精簡相關法庭程序以提高效率等。」

「免遣返聲請人沒有合法身分在香港逗留。無論他們的免遣返聲請的結果如何，聲請人均不得在香港合法逗留，也沒有權利在香港工作。當有必要根據相關法例、法庭訂立的法律原則及現行的羈留政策羈留免遣返聲請人時，他們會獲提供足夠的設施。特區政府亦會向他們提供人道援助，以維持他們在香港的生計。目前，香港共有三個羈留設施提供合共940個可羈留免遣返聲請人的名額，佔約15 800多名聲請人的百分之六，該份所謂報告所述有8 700名免遣返聲請人被羈留的說法嚴重不符事實。」

「另外，根據特區政府的更新遣送政策，若聲請不獲確立者就其免遣返聲請提出的司法覆核或相關許可申請被高等法院原訟法庭拒絕，即使有尚待處理的法律訴訟程序（包括向更高級法院就原訟法庭的裁決提出的上訴），入境處可遣送相關聲請不獲確立者離港。法庭亦確立了特區政府更新遣送政策是合法和合理的。」

特區政府發言人重申：「香港特區堅決維護國家主權、安全和發展利益，全面準確貫徹『一國兩制』方針的最高原則。憑藉國家堅實支持，香港在『一國兩制』下作為世上唯一兼享全球優勢和中國優勢的城市，定必繼續以安全守護人權、以發展促進人權、以合作推進人權，有理有據、有力有節地講好香港特區人權故事。」"
