Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-07 17:35,2025-10-07 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/07/P2025100700483.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 7), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 27 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 3 181 new CF cases in Guangdong in the past week (September 28 to October 4), which is more or less the same level as the previous week's 3 153 cases (September 21 to 27). The majority of cases (2 480 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. While the recent upward trend of CF cases in Jiangmen has been preliminarily contained, the number of cases still fluctuates at a relatively high level.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-07 17:35,2025-10-07 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/07/P2025100700479.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月七日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得27宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（九月二十八日至十月四日）廣東省新增3 181宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與九月二十一日至九月二十七日的一周相若（3 153宗）。大部分個案（2 480宗）在江門市錄得，全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。近期江門市基孔肯雅熱疫情的上升趨勢得到初步遏制，但仍在較高水平波動。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

A male passenger, aged 40, arrived in Hong Kong from Penang, Malaysia, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected heroin concealed in his check-in suitcase. He was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The cases will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (October 8).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-10-07 06:48,2025-10-07 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/07/P2025100700167.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 7) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
