防治蟲鼠督導委員會檢視在青衣自然徑的防控基孔肯雅熱跟進工作及討論來年防治蚊患和滅鼠工作計劃（附圖／短片）,2025-12-22 20:30,2025-12-22 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200698.htm,"政府跨部門防治蟲鼠督導委員會今日（十二月二十二日）召開第二十二次會議，詳細檢視各部門及持份者在青衣自然徑的防控基孔肯雅熱跟進工作，並討論二○二六年防治蚊患和滅鼠工作計劃，以助部門在來年制定其範疇下的防控蚊患及滅鼠措施。

防控基孔肯雅熱

委員會、衞生署衞生防護中心、食物環境衞生署（食環署）、各部門及相關持份者一直全方位跟進登革熱／基孔肯雅熱病媒監察及防治蚊患工作，以減低相關蚊傳疾病的傳播風險。在接獲防護中心通報相關蚊傳疾病個案後，食環署會立刻採取跟進行動，包括：


於24小時內啓動對病患者住所、工作地點及於傳染期到過地方的250米半徑範圍內進行蚊患調查，並把調查結果通知相關政府部門，以便作出跟進行動；
於目標範圍一帶進行殺滅幼蟲的防控工作，亦會於附近的成蚊棲息地進行霧化處理以殺滅成蚊；
為相關部門及持份者提供專業意見和技術支援，協助迅速制訂和實施有效的防蚊滅蚊措施；
巡查建築工地及私人住宅，對發現蚊子滋生的違規情況採取執法行動；
到訪目標範圍內的學校和幼兒設施，提供防蚊滅蚊資訊及協助；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張。


特別針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食環署自十一月十三日接獲首次有個案曾前往青衣自然徑並報稱受到蚊叮後，隨即調配資源在該處展開針對性工作，持續混合應用不同方法殺滅病媒蚊子，除了以背負式超低微量噴霧器進行霧化處理以殺滅成蚊外，亦在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。食環署更聯同相關部門（包括葵青民政事務處、荃灣葵青地政處、土木工程拓展署（土拓署）及渠務署）及持份者，協力清除蚊子滋生地及潛在蚊患地點、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署亦試用無人機尋找蚊子滋生地，以及透過設置新型捕蚊器控制及減低病媒密度。同時，食環署在該處一帶巡查，向有蚊蟲滋生或積水的地盤及住宅處所負責人，分別提出檢控及發出法定消除積水通知書。食環署亦向附近一帶的屋苑居民派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施防止被蚊叮咬。

葵青民政事務處、荃灣葵青地政處、土拓署及渠務署在青衣自然徑亦加強其範疇的行動，務求清除潛在蚊子滋生地。

此外，經政府聯繫後，業權人已把第三方在其私人土地上放置的未經批准構築物移除，以杜絕傳播基孔肯雅熱。

現時，食環署在該處設置了臨時誘蚊器，以監測措施成效及蚊患情況。食環署正檢視青衣北地區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器調查的覆蓋範圍，並會適時將青衣自然徑納入調查範圍內。

食環署將繼續積極探索使用無人機及電動爬梯機，以協助進行霧化處理殺滅成蚊的工作。若相關科技選項（包括機械狗、無人機及電動爬梯機）證實有助提升工作成效，當局會視乎情況，考慮將有關科技的應用範圍擴展至其他植被茂密的地區。

防治蚊患

食環署代表向委員會匯報二○二五年整體的蚊患情況。二○二五年的蚊患情況整體受控，白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數整體趨勢與往年相若，二○二五年五至七月錄得相對較高的誘蚊器指數。二○二五年五月記錄到六個調查區域的誘蚊器指數超過20%的警戒級別（即3級或以上），與二○二四年五月的10個區域相比有所下降。二○二五年六月，僅記錄到兩個調查區域的誘蚊器指數達到警戒級別，與二○二四年六月的八個區域相比顯著下降。二○二五年七月，僅記錄到一個調查區域的誘蚊器指數達到警戒級別。

踏入二○二六年，預計誘蚊器指數會如往年隨着天氣回暖及雨季來臨而開始上升。食環署與相關部門會加強防蚊滅蚊工作，除了繼續清除蚊子滋生地外，亦會於有需要的情況下施放殺幼蟲劑及以霧化處理方式殺滅成蚊，並於適當位置設置新型捕蚊器等。食環署亦會繼續聯同相關部門進行實地視察，向他們提供專業意見及技術指導。各部門亦密切留意相關蚊傳疾病的情況及監測指數的結果，持續更新蚊患黑點清單，以便因應實際情況調整和部署，確保防蚊滅蚊工作迅速及有效。

環境及生態局副局長兼委員會主席黃淑嫻特別提醒各部門必須作好準備，積極採取滅蚊行動，包括在雨季前及早清除蚊子的潛在滋生地，以及適時同步啓動霧化工作至雨季結束，以減低風險。

防治鼠患

食環署向委員會匯報，在「各界滅鼠行動」下部門採取一系列針對性防治鼠患措施，包括持續進行夜間滅鼠行動，以及善用適當滅鼠技術和工具等。就活鼠而言，食環署在二○二五年一至十一月共檢獲約115 100隻活鼠，較二○二四年同期檢獲約79 400隻增加約45%。若活鼠連同死鼠一同計算，食環署在二○二五年一至十一月共檢獲約140 800隻活鼠及死鼠，較二○二四年同期檢獲約110 100隻增加約28%。

食環署在會上介紹如何運用「無鼠百分比」的數據，協助制定針對性措施進一步提升防治鼠患的效能。此外，食環署持續針對93個鼠患主要黑點進行策略性滅鼠行動，調撥資源，務求全面及持續改善有關黑點的鼠患，預計可在二○二五年年底前達成將黑點數目減少六成的目標。

食環署亦向委員會匯報《滅鼠約章》（《約章》）在二○二四年十二月三十一日推出後的情況，截至二○二五年十二月十五日，共有684個住宅處所簽署《約章》，涵蓋約65萬住戶。當中，有兩個是「聯廈聯管」試驗計劃的參與者，涵蓋逾40個住戶。當其他「聯廈聯管」的參與者準備就緒，將會獲邀簽署《約章》。

食環署在會上亦匯報了紅磡船澳街鼠患的最新情況及持續進行防鼠滅鼠工作。自十一月底，食環署在該處捕獲的活鼠及檢獲的死鼠合共有31隻。同時，九龍城民政事務處已將有關發現鼠患的花盆移走，以除去老鼠匿藏地點。此外，食環署亦已加強上址附近一帶的街道潔淨服務，並已在該處安裝網絡攝錄機，收集違規行為的資料，進一步打擊該處非法棄置垃圾情況。食環署更會按既定準則及優次將該處納入二○二六年鼠隻活動調查的監察範圍。黃淑嫻提醒要締造一個無鼠環境，各界持份者齊心協力及提高居民對保持環境衞生的意識並養成良好的習慣至關重要，環境及生態局會繼續統籌「各界攜手，全港滅鼠行動」，推動跨界別、多專業及市民共同採取措施，攜手全面防治鼠患。

黃淑嫻在會上促請政府各部門密切留意已識別為高危地方的蚊患情況，並在其管轄範疇內加強防蚊滅蚊工作。她強調，考慮到病毒跨代傳播的特性及蚊卵稍後在雨季來臨及天氣回暖時仍可孵化成蚊，故此大家在這數月繼續努力清除蚊子滋生地至為重要。就二○二六年防治蚊患和滅鼠工作計劃，黃淑嫻強調部門應盡快制定來年其範疇下的防控蚊患及滅鼠措施，並繼續積極聯同各界鞏固防治蚊患及鼠患的工作，以及鼓勵市民配合防治蚊患和鼠患行動。

今日的會議由黃淑嫻主持，出席的決策局、政府部門及機構代表有：漁農自然護理署、建築署、土拓署、發展局、衞生署、渠務署、教育局、機電工程署、環境保護署、食環署、政府產業署、醫院管理局、民政事務總署、房屋署、路政署、政府新聞處、地政總署、康樂及文化事務署、海事處、社會福利署和水務署。"
DH reminds public to stay vigilant against infectious diseases while enjoying the coming winter holidays,2025-12-22 20:15,2025-12-22 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200723.htm,"âThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (December 22) reminded the public to practise strict personal, food and environmental hygiene as well as get seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) early to guard against some common and travel-related infectious diseases, regardless of staying in Hong Kong or travelling abroad during the coming Christmas and New Year holidays.

Seasonal influenza and other respiratory diseases

""The latest surveillance data showed that the local influenza activity remained at a high level. Based on past experience, Hong Kong's winter influenza season typically occurs between January and March. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the local influenza activity will further increase, leading to an overlap of the current influenza season with the winter influenza season early next year. For areas outside Hong Kong, influenza activity has continued to increase or reached a high level in most areas of the North Hemisphere, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Europe, South Korea, Japan and the Chinese Mainland. According to the latest information from the World Health Organization (WHO), a strain of influenza A (H3) virus known as subclade K has been rapidly increasing globally since August of this year. The detection of this virus strain increased in multiple countries and regions worldwide, including Hong Kong. Influenza A (H3) virus belonging to subclade K has been detected in more than 34 countries, but the current epidemiological data does not indicate that this strain causes more severe illness. Preliminary overseas scientific research data indicates that this season's influenza vaccines continue to provide protection to both children and adult, reducing the risk of seeking medical treatment or hospitalisation due to influenza. Although there are some antigenic differences between the currently circulating influenza A (H3) virus strain and the virus strain contained in the vaccine, the SIV can still offer protection against the variant strain of subclade K, as well as the influenza A (H1) and influenza B strains,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

Dr Tsui emphasised that receiving SIV is still one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of hospitalisation and death from infection. Public should receive vaccination as soon as possible regardless of staying locally or plan to travel abroad, as it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body for sufficient protection against influenza virus. Since influenza can cause serious complications, the CHP recommends that all persons aged six months or above receive the SIV, particularly high-risk individuals such as pregnant women, the elderly, children and those with underlying illnesses.

Regarding other respiratory diseases, the COVID-19 activity currently maintains at a low level recorded before April this year. Epidemiological data from local and other regions worldwide shows that there are generally periodic upsurges in the COVID-19 activity level approximately every six to nine months.

""It has been over five months since the last periodic upsurge of COVID-19 activity. Members of the public should receive COVID-19 vaccine in a timely manner to reduce the risk of serious illness and death due to COVID-19. Under the current Government's COVID-19 Vaccination Programme, individuals aged six months or above are eligible for free initial vaccine doses. High-risk priority groups can receive booster doses for free at least six months after the last dose or COVID-19 infection (whichever is later), regardless of the number of doses received previously,"" Dr Tsui said.

Regarding respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the RSV activity started to increase in many regions in North America and Europe. Prevention of RSV infection is the same as that for other respiratory diseases. Members of the public should maintain good personal, hand and environmental hygiene. Public with respiratory symptoms, even if the symptoms are mild, should wear a surgical mask, refrain from going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly. They should maintain hand hygiene before putting on and after removing a mask.

Acute gastroenteritis, norovirus infection and food poisoning

""Norovirus infection typically causes acute gastroenteritis. In general, norovirus is more active in winter (around December to March). As norovirus is highly contagious, individuals may become infected after being exposed to even a small amount of norovirus. The virus can be transmitted through various means, such as eating contaminated food, contacting with the vomit or excreta of infected persons, and contacting with contaminated objects, which may lead to a large-scale outbreak,"" Dr Tsui said.

To prevent acute gastroenteritis and norovirus infection, members of public should perform hand hygiene frequently, especially before handling food or eating, and after using the toilet. Wash hands with liquid soap and water, and rub for at least 20 seconds, then rinse with water and dry with a disposable paper towel or hand dryer. Since alcohol is not effective in killing norovirus, alcohol-based handrubs are not a substitute for handwashing with soap and water.

During the festive season, members of public have more opportunities to have parties with food delivery services or hotpot. To prevent food poisoning, apart from maintaining personal hygiene, they should also consume thoroughly washed and cooked food. For shellfish, the shells should be well scrubbed and the internal organs be removed before consumption. In addition, never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce. Use different chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination. For more food safety tips, please visit thewebpage of the Centre for Food Safety of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.

Mosquito-borne diseases

As of December 18, Hong Kong has recorded 57 dengue fever (DF) cases, all are imported cases. The imported cases were mainly from Indonesia (11), the Philippines (11), India and Thailand (nine each). Besides, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed chikungunya fever (CF) cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported. The patients have visited the Chinese Mainland, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Cuba, Sri Lanka and Mexico.

The WHO information showed that, from January to July 2025, over four million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths have been reported in 97 countries/territories. DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India and Vietnam have each recorded over 100 000 cases so far this year; Malaysia and Thailand have each recorded over 40 000 cases; and Singapore has also recorded over 3 500 cases. Regarding CF, since the beginning of 2025 and as of September 30, over 440 000 CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe.

""Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. Public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries. To prevent mosquito-borne diseases, travellers should wear loose, light-coloured, long-sleeved tops and trousers and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or exposed parts of the body. Travellers returning from areas affected by DF should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong,"" Dr Tsui said.

Measles

 The number of measles cases in some overseas countries has remained at a relatively high level recently. The outbreaks in North America (including the United States and Canada), Europe and neighbouring areas (including Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines) are ongoing due to the relatively low vaccination rate. Furthermore, an increasing number of measles cases have also been recorded in Japan and Australia this year. Hong Kong has recorded eight cases this year. Among them two cases (25 per cent) were classified as imported cases.

Those who plan to travel to places with outbreaks or a high incidence of measles should review their vaccination records and medical history as early as possible. If they have not been diagnosed with measles through laboratory tests and have never received or are not sure if they have received two doses of measles vaccine, they should consult a doctor at least two weeks prior to their trip for vaccination. For people born outside Hong Kong, they should pay special attention as they might not have received a measles vaccination during childhood.

""Pregnant women and women preparing for pregnancy who are not immune to measles or rubella, as well as children aged under one year who are not due for the first dose of the measles, mumps and rubella-combined vaccine under theHong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programmeare advised not to travel to places with outbreaks of measles. The incubation period of measles is seven to 21 days. Symptoms include fever, skin rash, cough, runny nose and red eyes. If such symptoms appear after returning from measles-endemic areas, people should wear surgical masks, stay home from work or school, avoid crowded places and contact with unvaccinated people, especially those with weak immune systems, pregnant women and children under one year old, and should consult their doctors as soon as possible,"" Dr Tsui said.

Relaunch of invitation for quotations on harbourfront event space in Hung Hom for short-term use,2025-12-22 20:05,2025-12-22 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200674.htm,"The Development Bureau (DEVB) announced today (December 22) the relaunch of the invitation for quotations for the short-term use of the Former Hung Hom Railway Freight Yard Pier as harbourfront event space (location plan in Annex). The invitation is open from today until January 22, 2026. The successful bidder shall be responsible for the development, operation, management and maintenance of the said event space while making it available for public enjoyment for approximately three years.

The Pier is currently a vacant site. The DEVB earlier announced the long-term development proposal for sites around the Hung Hom waterfront areas (including the Pier) with a view to transforming these areas into a new harbourfront landmark. The DEVB also indicated that, before the long-term development thereon, the Pier site will be revitalised, as a short-term measure, into a character-filled event space and public open space.

The DEVB had invited open quotations mid-year for the aforesaid short-term revitalisation project. However, in view of the availability of an additional piece of land adjacent to the Pier site, which can be included in the project in one go, and the Government's wish to strengthen the provisions on venue management, the DEVB has decided to cancel the aforesaid quotation exercise and relaunch it after strengthening the relevant terms and requirements.

For the land adjacent to the waterbody to the right of the Pier, it will become part of the event space site, expanding its area from approximately 1.5 hectares to 1.8 hectares.

Furthermore, in response to the incident at the Central Harbourfront Event Space this September regarding the cancellation of the passenger-carrying hot air balloon ride after the sale of tickets due to the failure to secure the relevant permit, the DEVB has beefed up the terms and requirements in the quotation documents to place a heavier onus on the venue operator (i.e. the successful bidder of this quotation exercise) in monitoring future event organisers and to regularise the communication and alert mechanisms so as to enable the DEVB, as the venue owner, to intervene in a timely manner. These strengthened provisions are aimed at better leveraging harbourfront resources to bring positive experiences for visitors as well as to better safeguard consumer rights. Relevant terms and requirements include:

(1) The venue operator is required to assess the credentials and experience of the applicants, their capability in hosting events, the feasibility of the proposed events, etc, before confirming approval of venue applications from event organisers. The venue operator shall submit regular assessment reports to the DEVB;

(2) The venue operator shall closely monitor the progress of event preparation and alert the DEVB in a timely manner, such as whether the event is in alignment with the original proposal, whether the relevant licenses or permits have been applied for and obtained in a timely manner, and whether the ticketing arrangement is proper; and

(3) In addition to the abovementioned alert mechanism, the venue operator and event organisers are required to hold a tripartite meeting with the DEVB prior to the events to confirm the progress of the final stage preparation and the arrangements made.

A two-envelope approach is adopted in this quotation exercise, under which the weighting for the technical proposal is 70 per cent and the price proposal is 30 per cent. Factors for assessing the technical proposals include whether the proposals would involve the hosting of any landmark events or installations, the availability of catering and entertainment facilities, and the development of night-time activities. Details of the quotation exercise are available on the website of the DEVB (www.devb.gov.hk). The DEVB will complete the quotation assessment as promptly as possible after the close of the invitation in January next year. Meanwhile, the Government is carrying out basic improvement works at the Pier and will hand over the Pier to the successful bidder as the venue operator. The Pier is anticipated to be open to the public in phases starting from the first quarter of next year."
SED expresses deep sorrow over passing of the Most Venerable Jing Yin,2025-12-22 19:56,2025-12-22 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200716.htm,"  The Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, today (December 22) expressed deep sorrow over the passing of the Most Venerable Jing Yin, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Eighth Abbot of Po Lin Monastery.

  Dr Choi said, ""The Most Venerable Jing Yin was a highly respected figure of great virtue who was deeply committed to education and cared greatly for students.

He actively promoted the development of Buddhist studies and education, benefiting the education sector and society at large. With a compassionate mind and a dedication to education, he was held in high esteem by teachers, students and the community. His spirit and ethos are deeply admirable.""

  ""We are grateful for the Most Venerable Jing Yin's contributions to education, and he will always be remembered."""
Remarks by SITI at media session,2025-12-22 19:50,2025-12-22 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200696.htm,"  The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, met the media together with the Permanent Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry and Chairman of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park Limited (HSITP), Mr Kevin Choi, and the Chief Executive Officer of the HSITP, Mr Vincent Ma, today (December 22). Following are the remarks by Professor Sun:

Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry: Today, we are so delighted to join the Chief Executive and a number of distinguished guests in witnessing the official opening of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone. This marks a significant milestone in the development of the Hetao Hong Kong Park with an accelerated pace and enhanced efficiency under the leadership of the Chief Executive.

  This year marks the conclusion of the National 14th Five-Year Plan. Today, the opening of the Hetao Hong Kong Park holds profound significance. This event not only underscores Hong Kong's proactive participation in and contribution to our national strategic development but also serves as a demonstration of Hong Kong's active role and substantial contribution to the national science and technology innovation strategy.

  The Hetao Hong Kong Park covers 87 hectares; together with another 210 hectares of I&T (innovation and technology) land in the San Tin Technopole, it is a key component of Hong Kong's new strategic layout of a South-North dual engine (finance-I&T). The Hong Kong Park will adopt a model of R&D (research and development) plus pilot production, prioritising the development of cutting-edge technologies in certain areas including life and health sciences, medical technology, AI and robotics, new energy and high-end smart manufacturing. The Park will attract leading enterprises to set up R&D centres and pilot production lines, supporting the entire process from R&D to production.

  At present, more than 60 local, Mainland and overseas enterprises and institutions have successfully settled in the Hetao Hong Kong Park. These companies and organisations are attracted by the geographical advantage, forthcoming cross-boundary policy measures and, more importantly, the huge potential and opportunity possessed by the Greater Bay Area (GBA) development. Hong Kongpossesses the unique advantage of connecting Mainland and overseas markets, which can help Mainland companies to go global, at the same time facilitating overseas companies in using the Hetao Hong Kong Park as a springboard to enter the GBA and Mainland markets.

  Moving forward, we will focus on rolling out the remaining land in Phase 1 development and pressing ahead with the planning for Phase 2. We will expedite the construction of the remaining five buildings and make sure all these five buildings will be ready starting from 2027.

  The Hetao Hong Kong Park will take today's opening as a new starting point. Leveraging the strengths of ""one country, two systems"" with the geographical advantage of ""one river, two banks"", we will accelerate collaboration with the Shenzhen Park to build a core engine for regional innovation development. We are now happy to take a few questions from you. Thank you."
FSD clarifies commentary about fire service installation and equipment,2025-12-22 19:48,2025-12-22 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200712.htm,"  In response to a commentary published by a media outlet that the trade doubted whether the suggestion by the Fire Services Department (FSD) to shut down fire service installation and equipment (FSIs) by phrases during building maintenance works is feasible, the FSD today (December 22) made the following clarification to set the record straight, as the media report does not fully reflect the facts.

  According to regulation 7 of the Fire Service (Installations and Equipment) Regulations (Cap. 95B), no person other than a registered fire service installation contractor shall maintain, inspect or repair any FSI in any premises. Any person contravening commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine at level 5 (i.e. $50,000). Any person who is not a registered fire service installation contractor attempts to interfere with FSIs may be in breach of the law. The FSD will follow up stringently.

  Maintenance, repair or inspection of FSIs must be carried out by registered fire service installation contractors, who will exercise professional judgement and carry out the relevant work in accordance with the FSD's instructions. Personnel responsible for building maintenance works have no authority to shut down FSIs. It is an extremely irresponsible behaviour for any frontline personnel to shut down FSIs in order to avoid false alarms triggered by the works.

  In fact, the FSD Circular Letter No. 1/2021 has already stipulated that disruption to the normal operation of FSIs caused by its shutdown should be kept to the minimum. When carrying out the works, the contractor concerned should adopt a systematic approach in shutting down the affected FSI by phrases and resume its normal operation as soon as practicable. If the affected portion of the system could not be reinstated to normal working condition by the end of a working shift, arrangements should be made for the portion to be isolated with the remainder of the system to be reinstated. Upon completion of the relevant works, the contractor shall issue the relevant Certificate of Fire Service Installations and Equipment in due course.

  In respect of the above matters, the FSD earlier held a meeting with the Association of Registered Fire Service Installation Contractors of Hong Kong. The trade expressed its full support and indicated its willingness to implement the relevant measures in accordance with the statutory requirements and guidelines."
行政長官主持河套香港園區開園典禮（附圖／短片）,2025-12-22 19:46,2025-12-22 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200638.htm," 行政長官李家超今日（十二月二十二日）主持河套深港科技創新合作區（河套合作區）香港園區開園典禮。河套合作區是國家「十四五」規劃下的粵港澳大灣區四個重大合作平台之一，河套香港園區以發展為聯通內地與國際的世界級科技創新樞紐，以及國家培育發展新質生產力的重要策源地為目標。

 李家超在典禮上表示：「河套的發展目標是要成為世界級創新平台，是國家實現地理上橫跨兩種社會制度、經濟和司法體制優勢，以科技創新為主題的重大合作區。」

「我們繼續推進河套香港園區的建設和發展，包括優化制度銜接、深化政策支援、積極引入優質企業與世界級科研團隊等。我有信心，河套合作區將成為香港創科發展的橋頭堡和試驗田，更將成為粵港澳大灣區，以至全球創新版圖上的創新政策示範地，是富有強大推動力的發展香港引擎。」

香港園區以兩期分批次發展。第一期第一批次的八幢大樓當中，兩座濕實驗室大樓及一座人才公寓已落成，分別提供約32000平方米樓面面積及100個公寓單位，目前已有超過60間機構和企業陸續進駐濕實驗室大樓，人才公寓首批住客亦已在十二月入住。其餘五座大樓的地基及上蓋工程已開展，並會在二○二七年起陸續完工。

與此同時，園區第二期用地的發展規劃布局工作已完成，兩期發展提供的總樓面面積可達200萬平方米。園區將按功能劃分科技區塊，包括生命健康科技、人工智能與數據科學、新科技與先進製造等支柱產業，促進產業的上、中、下游協同發展，打造完整創科產業鏈。

為加快香港園區的建設工作，園區公司已選定第一期用地特定地塊徵求市場發展意向，以期透過市場力量提速、提效推進香港園區發展。園區公司已收到27份回覆，現正進行分析，以展開下一階段的準備工作於二○二六年起有序推出地塊。香港特別行政區政府會仔細考慮以招標或其他不同方式將地塊推出市場，以達致最好利用市場資源一起發展香港園區的目的。

Afterwards, Customs officers also seized three suspected gravity-operated steel batons and two suspected controlled air pistols in the man's residential premises. The total estimated market value of the seized items was about $4 million.

A 25-year-old male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Johannesburg, South Africa, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found about 5kg of suspected cocaine concealed in the false compartments of his check-in suitcase. The man was subsequently arrested.

Later, Customs officers further seized three suspected gravity-operated steel batons and two suspected controlled air pistols in the arrested man's residence.

The investigation is ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Under the Firearms and Ammunition Ordinance, any person found guilty of possession of arms without a licence is liable to a maximum fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for 14 years.

根據香港法例第95B章《消防（裝置及設備）規例》第7條，任何非註冊消防裝置承辦商的人，均不得保養、檢查或修理裝置在任何處所內的任何消防裝置或設備。如有違反，即屬犯罪，一經定罪，可處第5級罰款（即50,000元）。任何非註冊消防承辦商的人士如嘗試干擾消防裝置，有機會觸犯法例，消防處必定嚴肅跟進。

消防裝置的保養、修理或檢查必須經由註冊消防裝置承辦商進行，承辦商會作出專業判斷，按消防處的指示進行相關工作。負責大廈維修工程的人員並無權限把消防裝置及設備關閉，若有前線人員為了避免消防裝置因工程誤鳴而企圖將其關閉，屬極之不負責任的行為。

事實上，《消防處通函第1/2021號》已列明，關閉消防裝置對其正常操作的影響應減至最低。承辦商應在大廈有工程進行時採用有系統的方法，將受影響的消防裝置分段關閉，並且盡快恢復其正常運作。如系統的受影響部分在工作更次的尾聲未能恢復正常操作，應把該部分孤立，讓系統其餘部分先恢復正常操作。當完成相關工作後，承辦商須在適當時間內發出相關「消防裝置及設備證書」。

就上述事宜，本處早前已與香港註冊消防工程公司商會舉行會議，業界表示將全力配合，並按法例的指引執行有關措施。"

Strategic Committee on Commodities convenes first meeting (with photos),2025-12-22 18:30,2025-12-22 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200602.htm,"The Strategic Committee on Commodities, chaired by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, convened its first meeting today (December 22).

Mr Chan said, ""Driven by the interplay of several major trends, including the geopolitical situation, technological transformation and green transition, the global supply and demand landscape for commodities such as precious metals, non-ferrous metals, traditional energy and materials related to new energy is undergoing profound changes. As one of the world's major consumers and importers and exporters of commodities, our country is pressing ahead with high-quality development, firmly advancing towards its dual carbon goals, and stepping up investment in green industries. These developments highlight our country's strengths in building a global hub for commodity resource allocation. As an international financial, trade and shipping centre, Hong Kong enjoys the unique advantage of connecting the Mainland and the world under the 'one country, two systems' principle, with the free flow of capital, goods and information, together with its efficient financial, logistics and professional services and a well-connected transport network. Hong Kong possesses enormous potential in developing the commodities market, enabling it to serve and contribute to the development of our country and the world on this front, while creating more diversified development opportunities for itself.

""In the past year or two, Hong Kong has been actively building a more vibrant commodities ecosystem, from joining the global warehousing network of the London Metal Exchange to facilitate physical metal delivery, to expediting the establishment of an international gold trading market, and we have already taken solid steps in this regard. Looking ahead, Hong Kong needs to, through highâlevel government coordination, formulate and implement a comprehensive development strategy for commodities in order to seize future development opportunities.""

He continued, ""The Committee brings together leaders from across the commodities trading ecosystem, including finance, commerce and trade, shipping, logistics and professional services sectors to conduct in-depth and comprehensive research into global commodities market trends, thoroughly review the current landscape and trends in areas such as physical trade, financial and derivative trading, as well as shipping and logistics. It will also study the opportunities for developing businesses of various major and emerging categories of commodities in Hong Kong, enhance market mechanisms and regulatory framework, build an industry ecosystem, and explore mutual market access with the Chinese Mainland. The Committee will also provide specific recommendations on the positioning, development planning and promotion strategy for Hong Kong's commodities market.""

At today's meeting, the Committee received a briefing on global commodities market trends and Hong Kong's development potential, and discussed the categories of commodities and key areas that should be prioritised for in-depth study and discussions.

In the 2025 Policy Address, the Chief Executive proposed the establishment of the ""Strategic Committee on Commodities"" to bring together industry representatives with the aim of strengthening the top-down design and long-term strategy of our commodity policy.

Under the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Motor Vehicle Export Facilitation Scheme, motor vehicle importers/distributors can submit advance information to Hong Kong Customs for pre-arrival notification and apply to relevant departments for a first registration tax concession on electric private cars that meet the eligibility criteria before shipping the vehicles to Hong Kong, thereby significantly enhancing overall logistical efficiency and convenience."
紅磡海濱活動空間的短期用途重新招標,2025-12-22 18:22,2025-12-22 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200622.htm,"發展局今日（十二月二十二日）公布，就前紅磡鐵路貨運碼頭（碼頭）用地發展作為海濱活動空間（位置見附件）的短期用途重新招標。招標期由即日起開始，至二○二六年一月二十二日截止。中標者未來約三年將負責發展、營運、管理和保養該活動空間並開放予訪客享用。

碼頭目前為空置土地，發展局早前公布包括碼頭在內的紅磡海濱地帶的長遠發展建議，把該區打造成海濱新地標，並表示在碼頭用作長遠發展前，先於短期內把它活化為特色活動及公共空間。

發展局於今年中曾為該短期活化計劃進行公開招標，考慮到碼頭毗鄰有額外用地可納入項目，而局方亦希望加入條款強化場地管理，發展局決定取消原有招標，並在修訂條款後重新招標。

活動空間將納入碼頭右邊水體的岸上用地，面積由原先約1.5公頃增至約1.8公頃。

此外，因應今年九月中環海濱活動空間曾發生公開售票後未能取得牌照而取消熱氣球載客升空活動的情況，局方在重新招標文件加入多項條款，強化場地營運者（即是次招標的中標者）對日後活動舉辦方的監察角色，並常規化溝通預警機制，讓發展局作為場地業主適時介入，目的是善用海濱用地為訪客帶來良好體驗，保障消費者權益。相關條款包括：

（1）明確要求場地營運者接納活動舉辦方的場地租用申請前，須先行評估申請者的背景、舉辦活動的能力、活動可行性等，並按時向發展局提交評估報告；

（2）場地營運者需密切監察活動籌備過程，例如活動安排是否符合原先建議、能否如期申領牌照／許可，以至門票出售安排等，並適時通報發展局；及

（3）除上述預警機制外，亦規定場地營運者及活動舉辦方須在開展活動前和發展局舉行三方會議，以便確立最後階段的情況和部署。

是次招標採取「雙信封制」，技術建議的評分比重佔百分之七十，而價格建議佔百分之三十。技術建議的評估因素包括會否提出舉辦地標式活動或裝置、引入餐飲娛樂設施，以及開發夜間活動等。招標詳情請參閱發展局網頁（www.devb.gov.hk）。發展局會在明年一月截標後盡快完成評標工作。與此同時，政府現正在碼頭用地進行基本改善工程，完成後會把用地交予中標的場地營運者，以明年首季起分階段開放給公眾使用。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-22 18:20,2025-12-22 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200604.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 22), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. As the CHP and relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails recently, the CHP continues to appeal to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

  The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm. All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

  Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

  
âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。全港醫生及醫院應留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。

針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
冬日假期將至　衞生署提醒市民歡度節日仍需防範傳染病,2025-12-22 18:15,2025-12-22 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200600.htm,"​聖誕及新年假期將至，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月二十二日）提醒市民，不論是留港或到外地歡度節日亦要時刻注意個人、食物及環境衞生，並及早接種季節性流感疫苗，以預防各種在冬季較常見或與旅遊相關的傳染病。

季節性流感及其他呼吸道疾病

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「最新的監測數據顯示，本港整體流感活躍程度維持在高水平。根據過往經驗，香港冬季流感季節大多於一至三月出現，因此不排除本地流感活躍程度會進一步上升，以致現時流感季節與明年初的冬季流感季節重疊。香港以外地區方面，北半球大部分地區（包括美國、加拿大、英國、歐洲、韓國、日本及中國內地）的流感活躍程度持續增加或已處於高水平。根據世界衞生組織（世衞）的最新資料，自今年八月起，一種名為亞分支K的甲型（H3）流感病毒活躍程度在全球快速上升，多個國家和地區對該病毒株的檢測數量都有所增加，本港亦然。目前全球已在超過34個國家和地區檢測到屬亞分支K的甲型（H3）流感病毒，但流行病學數據並未顯示疾病嚴重程度有所增加。海外科學研究數據初步顯示，本季使用的季節性流感疫苗繼續對兒童和成人提供保護，減低因流感而需求診或住院的風險。即使目前流行的甲型（H3）流感病毒與疫苗所含的病毒株存在一些抗原差異，季節性流感疫苗仍能對亞分支K的變異病毒株，以及疫苗中包含的甲型（H1）及乙型流感病毒提供保護。」

徐樂堅醫生強調，接種季節性流感疫苗仍然是最有效預防季節性流感及其併發症的方法，亦可減低入院及死亡風險。市民無論在本地或計劃外遊，應及早接種疫苗，因為接種疫苗後身體約需兩星期產生抗體，以對流感病毒提供足夠保護作用。由於流感可引致嚴重併發症，中心建議所有年滿6個月或以上的人士接種季節性流感疫苗，特別是孕婦、長者、兒童及長期病患者等高危人士。

 其他呼吸道傳染病方面，目前新冠病毒的整體活躍程度仍維持在今年四月前的低水平。本地及全球其他地區的流行病學數據均顯示，一般每隔約六至九個月會經歷一次新冠活躍周期。

徐樂堅醫生說：「本港距離上次新冠活躍周期已超過五個月，市民應適時接種新冠疫苗，以減低感染新冠病毒後重症和死亡的風險。現時在政府新冠疫苗接種計劃下，6個月大或以上人士可免費接種初始劑次，而高風險優先組別人士不論過往已接種多少劑疫苗，於接種上一劑疫苗或感染新冠病毒（以較後者為準）最少六個月後，均可免費接種加強劑。」

呼吸道合胞病毒方面，在北美和歐洲多處地區病毒活躍程度開始上升。預防呼吸道合胞病毒感染與其他呼吸道疾病的方法一樣，市民應時刻保持個人、手部和環境衞生。出現呼吸道感染病徵的市民，即使症狀輕微，都應佩戴外科口罩，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，並應盡早向醫生求診，而佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後要保持手部衞生。

急性腸胃炎、諾如病毒感染及食物中毒

徐樂堅醫生說：「諾如病毒常引致急性腸胃炎。一般來說，諾如病毒在冬天（約十二月至三月期間）較為活躍。由於病毒具高度傳染性，受影響人士即使接觸少量病毒，亦有機會受感染。病毒可透過進食受污染的食物、接觸受感染人士的嘔吐物或排泄物，及接觸受污染的物件等不同途徑傳播，有機會導致大規模爆發。」

要預防急性腸胃炎及諾如病毒感染，必須經常保持雙手清潔，尤其在處理食物或進食前及如廁後。洗手時應以梘液和清水清潔雙手，搓手最少20秒，用水過清並用抹手紙或乾手機弄乾。由於酒精未能有效殺死諾如病毒，酒精搓手液不能代替使用梘液和清水潔手。

節慶期間，市民較多機會舉行派對安排食物到會或火鍋，要預防食物中毒，除了注意個人衞生，所有食物亦必須徹底清潔並煮熟後方可食用；處理貝類海產時，須洗淨外殼並去除內臟，才可進食。此外，切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬，並應使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。有關食物安全的更多資訊，可瀏覽食物環境衞生署食物安全中心網頁。

蚊傳疾病

截至十二月十八日，香港今年共錄得57宗登革熱個案，全屬外地傳入個案。外地傳入個案主要從印度尼西亞（11宗）、菲律賓（11宗）、印度和泰國（各9宗）傳入。另外，本港今年累計錄得81宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，當中11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案（患者曾到過中國內地、孟加拉、印度、印度尼西亞、古巴、斯里蘭卡和墨西哥）。

世衞資料顯示，由二○二五年一月至七月，全球97個國家／地區呈報了超過400萬宗登革熱個案及超過3 000宗相關死亡個案。登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點普遍流行，印度尼西亞、印度和越南今年已分別錄得超過十萬宗個案，馬來西亞和泰國亦分別錄得超過四萬宗個案，新加坡則錄得超過3 500宗個案。基孔肯雅熱方面，自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了超過44萬宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案，個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。

徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。要預防蚊傳疾病，市民應穿着寬鬆、淺色的長袖上衣及長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。如從受影響地區返港，應在至少14日內繼續使用昆蟲驅避劑。」

麻疹

近期部分海外國家的麻疹個案仍維持在較高水平，其中北美洲（包括美國及加拿大）、歐洲及東南亞地區（包括越南、柬埔寨和菲律賓），因疫苗覆蓋接種率偏低而持續爆發麻疹。另外，日本和澳洲今年錄得的麻疹個案亦有所上升。香港今年則錄得8宗個案，當中2宗（25%）屬外地傳入個案。

市民如計劃前往出現麻疹爆發或高發病率的地方，應及早檢視自己的疫苗接種紀錄及病歷，若以往未經化驗確診感染麻疹，以及從未或不確定曾否接種兩劑麻疹疫苗，應在出發前最少兩星期諮詢醫生接種疫苗。而非本港出生的市民應特別留意，因其可能未曾在童年接種麻疹疫苗。

徐樂堅醫生說：「懷孕婦女及計劃懷孕婦女若對麻疹或風疹（德國麻疹）沒有免疫力，以及本港未滿一歲仍未適齡在『香港兒童免疫接種計劃』下接種麻疹、流行性腮腺炎及德國麻疹混合疫苗的兒童，不應前往爆發麻疹或風疹的目的地。麻疹的潛伏期為七至二十一日，病徵包括發燒、皮膚出現紅疹、咳嗽、流鼻水和眼紅等。市民如從麻疹流行地區回港後出現相關病徵，應戴上外科口罩，停止上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方和避免與未有免疫力人士接觸，尤其是抵抗力弱人士、孕婦及未滿一歲的兒童，並盡早向醫生求診。」

如欲了解以上各種傳染病的詳情，可參閱衞生防護中心的季節性流感、2019冠狀病毒病、食物中毒、諾如病毒感染、基孔肯雅熱、登革熱及麻疹專頁。此外，計劃外遊的市民可瀏覽旅遊健康服務網，查閱最新的旅遊健康資訊及建議。"

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB) and the Intellectual Property Department (IPD), launched the Intellectual Property (IP) Financing Sandbox today (December 22).

As set out in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"", the IP Financing Sandbox aims to assist pilot sectors in leveraging IP assets for financing.

The Sandbox serves to provide a collaborative and risk-controlled environment for banks, IP valuation firms, legal practitioners and other relevant professions to test the full lifecycle of IP financing arrangements that are based on IP assets such as patents, trademarks and copyrights.

Through the Sandbox, banks can develop and refine their IP financing arrangements with the support from multidisciplinary professionals as well as guidance by the HKMA, the CEDB and the IPD. This initiative can also enable banks to accumulate practical experience in providing IP financing to better serve the needs of innovative enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises which are rich in IP assets but may lack tangible assets that can be pledged as collateral for bank financing.

Three major banks in Hong Kong have joined the Sandbox as inaugural participants, and have solicited interests from clients from the biotechnology, electronics and technology sectors to conduct pilot trials of IP financing through the Sandbox (see Annex)."

Financing sandbox launched today with opening of Hong Kong Technology and Innovation Support Centre to foster intellectual property financing and innovation,2025-12-22 17:00,2025-12-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200461.htm,"  The Government announced today (December 22) the official launch of the intellectual property (IP) financing sandbox and the opening of the Hong Kong Technology and Innovation Support Centre (HKTISC), marking key milestones in promoting IP financing and further developing Hong Kong's IP trading ecosystem while fostering innovation.

  The Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address the launch of the sandbox to assist pilot sectors (particularly the technology sector) in leveraging IPs for financing with the support of the banking, insurance, valuation, legal and other professions. The sandbox will provide a collaborative and risk-controlled environment for stakeholders to test out the full lifecycle of IP financing and accumulate practical experience in providing IP financing.

  With the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB), the Intellectual Property Department (IPD) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) deliberation, the sandbox is underpinned by the following four core operating principles:

(1) Recognition of IP value: Participating banks will consider the value of IPs owned by borrowing enterprises, alongside the borrower's credit demand, financial position and repayment ability in their credit underwriting process.

(2) Independent and standardised valuation: To ensure credibility, IP valuation will be conducted by independent service providers using universally accepted methods. Where appropriate, qualitative patent evaluation reports can be obtained to support this process.

(3) Risk management: Participating banks should comply with applicable supervisory requirements on risk management, while participating enterprises should comply with the legal and regulatory requirements in respect of maintaining and developing the IP assets concerned.

(4) Stakeholder collaboration: The initiative relies on a cohesive ecosystem. It brings together enterprises that hold IP assets, banks, valuation experts, legal practitioners and other relevant professionals to co-create successful financing transactions.

  The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, said that the IP financing sandbox, together with other related measures announced in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"", would help leverage Hong Kong's unique strengths to build an ecosystem where IP is protected with rigour, valued with clarity, and financed with confidence, with a view to strengthening Hong Kong's role as a regional IP trading centre.

  By enabling enterprises to leverage their IP assets for financing, the sandbox will help unlock a new financing channel, thereby supporting the commercialisation of outcomes of research and development as well as creativity, and promoting innovation and technology as a key driver of economic growth.

Three major banks have committed to participating in the sandbox, while nearly 30 professional firms from the legal and valuation sectors have indicated keen interest in participating. The CEDB, the IPD and the HKMA will closely monitor the progress of the pilot projects, gather feedback, and provide guidance as needed. It is anticipated that several trial cases are in the pipeline for the first phase of the sandbox.

In addition, the HKTISC that officially commenced full operations today is another key complementary initiative in promoting IP financing. With the support of the IPD, the HKTISC will closely engage small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the innovation and technology sector and provide a qualitative patent evaluation service to assess, based on national standards, the quality of their patents from legal, technological and economic perspectives. The Government will also launch a support scheme through the HKTISC in 2026 to financially assist SMEs to engage professional service providers for the valuation of their whole IP portfolios in monetary terms.

These integrated measures aim to provide an objective reference about the strengths of the patents and the monetary valuation of the whole IP portfolios owned by the SMEs, facilitating more effective credit assessment and investment analysis.

The Technology and Innovation Support Centre is a dedicated programme of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which supports researchers and innovators at different stages of the innovation cycle, helping them make use of the IP system (especially by means of patents) to protect their inventions and guiding them to bring the technology to market. With the recognition of the Hong Kong Productivity Council as a Technology and Innovation Support Centre hosting institution by the China National Intellectual Property Administration and WIPO, the HKTISC will join the 200-plus strong Technology and Innovation Support Centre network in the country, which promotes better integration of Hong Kong into overall national development."
LCSD introduces new measures to strengthen efforts to combat touting activities,2025-12-22 17:00,2025-12-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200238.htm,"  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) announced today (December 22) that new measures will be implemented to strengthen efforts to combat unauthorised transfer of bookings of LCSD recreation and sports facilities/venues (commonly referred to as touting activities).

  The new measures are as follows:

(1) Penalties for using computer programmes or automated tools to interfere with SmartPLAY

  To ensure the fair use of the SmartPLAY system, the LCSD will combat improper conduct involving the use of computer programmes or other automated tools to make booking transactions or interfere with the normal operation of the system. Specifically, SmartPLAY has incorporated conditions prohibiting the use of computer programmes or other automated tools to make bookings (www.smartplay.lcsd.gov.hk/website/en/about/conditions-of-use-of-smartplay.html). Starting from January 21, 2026, if users breach the conditions concerned, the LCSD will immediately suspend their accounts for 360 days without giving any prior notice. The LCSD once again reminds users of the need to comply with the ""Conditions of Use of SmartPLAY"", to properly manage the information of their SmartPLAY accounts, and not to disclose their user account numbers and passwords to others. Users having so provided their user account numbers and passwords to a third party are advised to change their passwords as soon as possible and regularly update them to prevent unauthorised use of their accounts.

(2) New measures for booking indoor basketball and volleyball courts

  Currently, a hirer who books turf soccer pitch through SmartPLAY is required to provide the SmartPLAY user account information of four other users. The hirer and three of the users named in the booking are required to check-in together and be present during the use of the booked session. This arrangement, aiming to ensure that hirers are genuine users, is generally effective since implementation. It will apply to indoor basketball and volleyball courts, which are popular facilities, starting from January 21, 2026. A hirer is required to provide the information of two other users when booking an indoor basketball or volleyball court. The hirer and one of the users named in the booking are required to check-in together and be present during use of the booked session. Details are available at the LCSD's thematic webpage ""Improvement measures to booking and use of recreation and sports facilities"" (www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/facilities/facilitiesbooking/procedure/ls_fac_improve.html).

(3) Standby arrangement no longer applicable to indoor basketball and volleyball courts

  Under the existing measures applicable to some recreation and sports facilities, if a hirer does not take up the booked facility 10 minutes after the booked session starts, the LCSD may at its discretion permit other users to use the facility free of charge for the same purpose as the original hirer (commonly referred to as the standby arrangement), on condition that there are no other same-type facilities available for booking at the material time. In this connection, the LCSD has observed that certain hirers of indoor basketball and volleyball courts deliberately do not take up the booked sessions on the day of use, and are suspected to have engaged in touting activities by arranging for other users to use the booked courts under the standby arrangement. To combat such abuse of the standby arrangement, and making reference to the current arrangement for turf football pitches, the standby arrangement will no longer be applicable to indoor basketball and volleyball courts with effect from December 30, 2025.

  LCSD will closely monitor the effectiveness of the new measures, and continue to enhance SmartPLAY as well as implement further anti-touting measures as necessary."

知識產權融資沙盒今日推出　香港技術與創新中心同步營運　促進知識產權融資及創新發展,2025-12-22 17:00,2025-12-22 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200465.htm,"政府今日（十二月二十二日）宣布，知識產權融資沙盒正式推出，香港技術與創新支持中心亦同步營運，標誌着香港在推動知識產權融資、進一步發展知識產權交易生態圈和培育創新方面的重要里程碑。

行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》宣布推出知識產權融資沙盒，透過銀行、保險、估值、法律和其他專業，協助試點行業（特別是科技行業）利用知識產權進行融資。沙盒將提供一個協作和風險可控的環境，讓持份者測試整個融資安排和累積實務經驗。

融資沙盒由商務及經濟發展局（商經局）、知識產權署和香港金融管理局（金管局）共同籌劃，其運作建基於以下四項核心目標：

（一）確認知識產權價值：
參與銀行在信貸審批過程中，會考慮借款企業所擁有的知識產權資產價值，以及借款人的信貸需求、財務狀況及還款能力。

（二）獨立及標準化估值：
知識產權的估值會由獨立服務提供者按國際認可的方法進行，確保估值具公信力。在適用情況下，可索取專利質素分析報告，以支援相關估值程序。

（三）風險管理：
參與銀行須符合風險管理的監管要求；參與企業則須符合維護及發展相關知識產權資產的法例及法規要求。

（四）持份者協作：
計劃的成功有賴一個緊密協作的生態圈，沙盒匯聚擁有知識產權資產的企業、銀行、估值專家、法律執業者及其他相關專業人士，共同促成融資交易。

商經局局長丘應樺表示，知識產權融資沙盒連同其他《行政長官2025年施政報告》公布的相關措施，將有助發揮香港的獨特優勢，構建一個讓知識產權受嚴格保護、獲清晰估值及具融資信心的生態系統，從而鞏固香港作為區域知識產權貿易中心的地位。

透過讓企業運用其知識產權資產進行融資，沙盒可為企業打開新的融資渠道，支持科研及創意成果的商品化，並進一步推動創新科技成為經濟增長的重要動力。

三間主要銀行已承諾參與計劃，而來自法律及估值界別接近30間專業機構亦已表達濃厚參與意欲。商經局、知識產權署和金管局會密切監察試點項目的進展及收集意見，並按需要提供指導。沙盒計劃第一階段預計將有數宗試點個案。

此外，今日正式全面投入運作的香港技術與創新支持中心，是推動知識產權融資另一項重要配套措施。在知識產權署的協助下，中心將與創新科技界別的中小企業緊密合作，提供專利質素分析服務，按照國家標準，從法律、技術及經濟多個層面評估其專利的質素。政府亦會透過中心於二○二六年推出支援計劃，資助中小企業聘用專業服務提供者，為其整體知識產權組合進行金額估值。

上述綜合措施旨在就中小企業所持有專利的優勢，以及其整體知識產權組合的金額估值，提供客觀參考，從而促進更具效益的信貸評估及投資分析。
​
技術與創新支持中心是世界知識產權組織的專項計劃，旨在於創新周期不同階段支援科研人員及創新者，協助他們善用知識產權制度（特別是專利）保障發明，並引導其將技術商品化。隨着香港生產力促進局獲國家知識產權局和世界知識產權組織認可為技術與創新支持中心承辦機構，香港技術與創新支持中心正式成為國家200餘所技術與創新支持中心網絡的成員之一，推動香港更好地融入國家發展大局。"

新措施內容如下：

（一）使用電腦程式或自動化工具干擾「SmartPLAY康體通」的罰則

為保障公平使用「SmartPLAY康體通」系統，康文署將打擊使用電腦程式或其他自動化工具進行預訂交易或干擾系統正常運作的不當行為。「SmartPLAY康體通」加入了禁止使用電腦程式或其他自動化工具預訂場地的條件（www.smartplay.lcsd.gov.hk/website/tc/about/conditions-of-use-of-smartplay.html），由二○二六年一月二十一日起，如用戶違反有關條件，康文署會暫停其帳戶360日，無須給予任何預先通知。康文署再次提醒用戶必須遵守「SmartPLAY康體通」的使用條件，妥善管理SmartPLAY帳戶資料，切勿向他人透露用戶帳號及密碼；曾將SmartPLAY帳號及密碼提供予第三者的用戶，請盡快及定期更新用戶密碼，以免帳戶被盜用。

At a briefing session on gold market development today (December 22), the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, told industry stakeholders that a complete industry chain has initially taken shape for Hong Kong's gold market, and the Government is actively working towards the goal of establishing Hong Kong as an international centre for gold trading, storage, clearing and risk management.

Organised by the FSTB, the briefing session aimed to introduce to the industry the Government's long-term strategy and overall direction for building an international gold trading market. This encompasses multiple areas, including expanding storage capacity, enhancing gold supply, establishing infrastructure, diversifying investment vehicles and developing a local gold trading ecosystem. Attendees included representatives from exchanges, banks, asset management companies, gold mining, trading firms and refineries, warehouse operators as well as logistics providers.

Mr Hui said, ""Stemming from the visionary idea of developing an international gold trading centre put forward by the Chief Executive in his 2024 Policy Address, I am pleased to see that Hong Kong's gold market has begun to take shape, with a complete industry chain preliminarily established over the past year or so under the concerted efforts of the Government, regulators and the industry. The industry's response has been positive, and many constructive suggestions have been received. Leveraging Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and its unique advantages of enjoying strong support from the motherland and being closely connected to the world, we will continue working closely with the industry, with a view to developing Hong Kong into an international hub for gold trading, storage, clearing and risk management.""

He highlighted the meaningful strides already realised through Government's initiatives. In terms of storage facilities, the Airport Authority Hong Kong has completed the first-phase expansion of the precious metals depository at the Hong Kong International Airport, increasing capacity to 200 tonnes, and is pressing ahead with plans to further expand it to 1 000 tonnes. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Gold Exchange has launched its first offshore vault in Hong Kong. In addition, the FSTB and the Shenzhen Municipal Financial Regulatory Bureau have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly build a deeply integrated regional gold ecosystem, laying a foundation for further co-operation in processing trade between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. On gold trading and clearing, the central clearing system for gold in Hong Kong, governed by a wholly government-owned company, is scheduled to commence trial operation in 2026.

To support the setting up of a trade organisation for the gold industry, the Government will set up a preparatory taskforce to engage a wide range of local and international stakeholders, with a view to promoting industry collaboration and facilitating the formation of a self-governing industry body. The preparatory taskforce will also hold in-depth discussions on details such as the structure, membership and financial arrangements of the future industry organisation.

Mr Hui added, ""Through the upcoming preparatory taskforce, we look forward to further strengthening our collaboration with the industry. The future industry organisation will help enhance communication with the Government and regulators, and play an instrumental role in business development, global promotion, international co-operation and talent nurturing, thereby contributing to the long-term development of Hong Kong's gold market."""

黃金市場發展簡介會由財庫局舉辦，旨在向業界介紹政府建立國際黃金交易市場的長遠策略和整體方向，當中涵蓋拓展倉儲、提升黃金供給、建設基礎設施、豐富投資工具及發展本地黃金交易生態圈等多個範疇。交易所、銀行、資產管理、金礦勘探、貿易及精煉、倉儲和運輸界別均有派員出席。

許正宇說：「自行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》中前瞻性地提出要構建國際黃金交易中心，經過一年多的時間，結合政府、監管機構和業界的力量，我樂見香港黃金市場的全產業鏈已初步形成。過程中，業界反應正面，提供了許多寶貴意見。憑藉香港作為國際金融中心的地位，以及背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，我們會繼續與業界緊密合作，合力將香港打造為國際黃金交易、儲存、清算及風險管理的中心。」

他指出，政府至今推出的各項措施已取得實質進展。在倉儲設施方面，香港機場管理局已完成機場貴金屬儲存庫首階段擴建，容量達200公噸，並正積極落實進一步擴容至1 000公噸的計劃。同時，上海黃金交易所已在香港建立首個離岸倉庫。此外，財庫局已與深圳市地方金融管理局簽署合作備忘錄，共同構建深度融合的區域黃金生態圈，為港深兩地開展加工貿易合作奠定基礎。在黃金交易清算方面，由政府全資擁有的公司所管理的香港黃金中央清算系統計劃於二○二六年內開展試營運。

為支持業界成立黃金行業組織，政府將成立籌備小組，廣泛吸納本地及國際業界持份者參與，推動業界協作，促成一個由業界自主營運的行業組織。籌備小組將就行業組織的組成方式、成員資格及財務安排等細節深入討論。

許正宇補充說：「我們期望透過即將成立的籌備小組進一步加強與業界的合作。日後，行業組織將有助深化與政府及監管機構的溝通，並在業務發展、海內外推廣、國際合作及人才培育等方面發揮關鍵作用，助力香港黃金市場實現長遠發展。」"

According to the Composite CPI, overall consumer prices rose by 1.2% in November 2025 over the same month a year earlier, the same as that in October 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rate of increase in the Composite CPI (i.e. the underlying inflation rate) in November 2025 was 1.0%, also the same as that in October 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, the average monthly rate of increase in the Composite CPI for the 3-month period ending November 2025 was 0.1%, the same as that for the 3-month period ending October 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the corresponding rates of increase were both 0.1%.

  Analysed by sub-index, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.5%, 1.1% and 1.1% respectively in November 2025, as compared to 1.4%, 1.1% and 1.0% respectively in October 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 0.9%, 1.0% and 1.1% respectively in November 2025, as compared to 0.9%, 1.0% and 1.0% respectively in October 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, for the 3-month period ending November 2025, the average monthly rates of change in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 0.0%, 0.1% and 0.1% respectively. The corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending October 2025 were 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the average monthly rates of change in the seasonally adjusted CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) for the 3-month period ending November 2025 were 0.0%, 0.1% and 0.1% respectively, and the corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending October 2025 were 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.2% respectively.

  Amongst the various components of the Composite CPI, year-on-year increases in prices were recorded in November 2025 for transport (3.5%), alcoholic drinks and tobacco (2.1%), miscellaneous services (1.9%), housing (1.6%), meals out and takeaway food (1.3%), miscellaneous goods (1.3%), and basic food (0.7%).

  On the other hand, year-on-year decreases in the components of the Composite CPI were recorded in November 2025 for clothing and footwear (-4.1%), durable goods (-3.3%), and electricity, gas and water (-0.5%).

  Taking the first 11 months of 2025 together, the Composite CPI rose by 1.4% over a year earlier. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.9%, 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.1%, 1.4%, 1.0% and 0.9% respectively.

  For the 3 months ending November 2025, the Composite CPI rose by 1.2% over a year earlier, while the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) rose by 1.4%, 1.0% and 1.0% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.0% and 1.0% respectively.

  For the 12 months ending November 2025, the Composite CPI was on average 1.4% higher than that in the preceding 12-month period. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.9%, 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.1%, 1.4%, 1.0% and 1.0% respectively.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that consumer price inflation stayed subdued in November, with the year-on-year increase in underlying Composite CPI unchanged at 1.0%. Price pressures on various major components were contained in general.

  Looking ahead, overall inflation should remain modest in the near term, as cost pressures on the domestic and external fronts are still broadly in check.

Further information

  The CPIs and year-on-year rates of change at section level for November 2025 are shown in Table 1. The time series on the year-on-year rates of change in the CPIs before and after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures are shown in Table 2. For discerning the latest trend in consumer prices, it is also useful to look at the changes in the seasonally adjusted CPIs. The time series on the average monthly rates of change during the latest 3 months for the seasonally adjusted CPIs are shown in Table 3. The rates of change in the original and the seasonally adjusted Composite CPI and the underlying inflation rate are presented graphically in Chart 1.

Hong Kong's Balance of Payments and International Investment Position statistics for third quarter of 2025,2025-12-22 16:30,2025-12-22 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200379.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (December 22) the preliminary Balance of Payments (BoP) and International Investment Position (IIP) statistics of Hong Kong for the third quarter of 2025. This release also included the preliminary External Debt (ED) statistics of Hong Kong for the same period.

I. Balance of Payments

  Hong Kong recorded a BoP deficit of $136.5 billion (16.0% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) in the third quarter of 2025. Reserve assets correspondingly decreased by the same amount. This was against a BoP surplus of $105.5 billion (13.4% of GDP) in the second quarter of 2025.

Current account

  The current account recorded a surplus of $98.2 billion (11.5% of GDP) in the third quarter of 2025. This reflects that Hong Kong's savings was greater than its investment, enabling Hong Kong to accumulate external financial assets (such as equity securities or debt securities) as a buffer against global financial volatilities. Compared with the current account surplus of $113.2 billion (13.9% of GDP) in the third quarter of 2024, the decrease in surplus was mainly due to the decrease in net inflow of primary income, partly offset by the increase in services surplus.

  The goods account recorded a surplus of $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2025, as against a deficit of $0.6 billion in the same quarter of 2024. Over the same period, the services surplus increased from $38.8 billion to $48.1 billion. The primary income inflow and outflow amounted to $576.1 billion and $521.5 billion respectively, thus yielding a net inflow of $54.5 billion in the third quarter of 2025, compared with a net inflow of $80.3 billion in the same quarter of 2024.

Financial account

  An overall increase in financial non-reserve assets amounting to $271.0 billion (31.7% of GDP) was recorded in the third quarter of 2025, compared with an overall increase of $21.1 billion (2.7% of GDP) in the second quarter of 2025. The overall increase recorded in the third quarter of 2025 was due to the net increases in other investment, portfolio investment and financial derivatives, partly offset by the net decrease in direct investment.

  In the third quarter of 2025, reserve assets decreased by $136.5 billion, as against an increase of $105.5 billion in the second quarter of 2025.

II. International Investment Position

  At the end of the third quarter of 2025, both Hong Kong's external financial assets and liabilities stood at a very high level, amounting to $59,586.8 billion (18.2 times of GDP) and $39,936.9 billion (12.2 times of GDP) respectively, a typical feature of a prominent international financial centre.

  Hong Kong's net external financial assets (i.e. assets minus liabilities) amounted to $19,649.9 billion (6.0 times of GDP) at the end of the third quarter of 2025, compared with $18,364.7 billion (5.7 times of GDP) at the end of the second quarter of 2025. Hong Kong's net external financial assets to GDP ratio is one of the largest in the world, which provides the economy with a strong cushion against sudden external shocks.

III. External Debt

  At the end of the third quarter of 2025, Hong Kong's gross ED amounted to $15,746.1 billion (4.8 times of GDP). Compared with $15,463.6 billion (also 4.8 times of GDP) at the end of the second quarter of 2025, gross ED increased by $282.5 billion. This was mainly attributable to the increase in ED of other sectors, while increases in ED of the banking sector, debt liabilities in direct investment (intercompany lending) and ED of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also contributed.

  As one of the world's major financial centres, Hong Kong has a significant amount of ED held against the local banking sector arising through normal banking businesses. At the end of the third quarter of 2025, 52.3% of Hong Kong's ED was attributable to the banking sector. Other ED mainly consisted of ED of other sectors (29.9%) and debt liabilities in direct investment (intercompany lending) (16.5%).

Further information

  BoP is a statistical statement that systematically summarises, for a specific time period (typically a year or a quarter), the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world (i.e. between residents and non-residents).

  IIP is a balance sheet showing the stock of external financial assets and liabilities of an economy at a particular time point.

  The difference between the total value of external financial assets and liabilities is the net IIP of the economy, which provides a measure of net financial claims on non residents plus gold bullion held as monetary gold.

  Gross ED, at a particular time point, is the outstanding amount of those actual current, and not contingent, liabilities that are owed to non-residents by residents of an economy and that require payment of principals and / or interests by the debtors at some time points in the future.

  Table 1 presents Hong Kong's BoP. Table 2 presents the detailed current account and capital account, while Table 3 presents the detailed financial account. Table 4 shows Hong Kong's IIP, and Table 5 shows Hong Kong's ED.

  Statistics on BoP, IIP and ED for the third quarter of 2025 are preliminary figures, which are subject to revision upon the availability of more data. With the incorporation of the latest data from surveys and other sources, the statistics on BoP, IIP and ED for 2024 have been revised.

  The latest statistical tables of BoP (including seasonally adjusted current account), IIP and ED can be downloaded at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/scode260.html). Analysis of the statistics, together with the conceptual and methodological details, are presented in the publication Balance of Payments, International Investment Position and External Debt Statistics of Hong Kong, Third Quarter 2025 published by the C&SD. Users can download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1040001&scode=260).

經季節性調整的綜合消費物價指數，截至二零二五年十一月止的三個月的平均每月升幅為0.1%，與截至二零二五年十月止的三個月的相應升幅相同。剔除所有政府一次性紓困措施的影響，相應的升幅均為0.1%。

從細分指數分析，甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數在二零二五年十一月份的按年升幅分別為1.5%、1.1%及1.1%，而二零二五年十月份的相應升幅分別為1.4%、1.1%及1.0%。剔除所有政府一次性紓困措施的影響，甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數在二零二五年十一月份的按年升幅分別為0.9%、1.0%及1.1%，在二零二五年十月份的升幅則分別為0.9%、1.0%及1.0%。

經季節性調整的甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數，截至二零二五年十一月止的三個月的平均每月變動率分別為0.0%、0.1%及0.1%，而截至二零二五年十月止的三個月的相應變動率分別為0.1%、0.1%及0.2%。剔除所有政府一次性紓困措施的影響，截至二零二五年十一月止的三個月，經季節性調整的甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數的平均每月變動率分別為0.0%、0.1%及0.1%，而截至二零二五年十月止的三個月的相應變動率則分別為0.1%、0.1%及0.2%。

二零二五年第三季香港國際收支平衡及國際投資頭寸統計,2025-12-22 16:30,2025-12-22 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200430.htm,"政府統計處今日（十二月二十二日）發布二零二五年第三季香港國際收支平衡及國際投資頭寸的初步統計數字，並一併發布同期的香港對外債務的初步統計數字。

I.國際收支平衡

香港於二零二五年第三季錄得1,365億元的國際收支赤字（相當於本地生產總值的16.0%），而儲備資產相應地減少同等數額。二零二五年第二季則錄得1,055億元的盈餘（相當於本地生產總值的13.4%）。

經常賬戶

二零二五年第三季的經常賬戶錄得982億元盈餘（相當於本地生產總值的11.5%），這反映香港儲蓄多於投資，令其累積對外金融資產（例如股本證券或債務證券），在環球金融波動時提供緩衝。與二零二四年第三季的1,132億元經常賬戶盈餘（相當於本地生產總值的13.9%）比較，盈餘減少主要是由於初次收入淨流入減少，而服務貿易盈餘增加則抵銷了部分經常賬戶盈餘的跌幅。

二零二五年第三季的貨物貿易錄得15億元盈餘，而二零二四年同季則錄得6億元赤字。同期，服務貿易盈餘由388億元增加至481億元。二零二五年第三季的初次收入流入和流出分別為5,761億元和5,215億元，從而產生545億元淨流入，而二零二四年同季則錄得803億元淨流入。

金融賬戶

二零二五年第三季非儲備金融資產錄得2,710億元的整體增幅（相當於本地生產總值的31.7%），而二零二五年第二季則錄得211億元的整體增幅（相當於本地生產總值的2.7%）。二零二五年第三季的整體增幅源自其他投資、證券投資和金融衍生工具淨增加，而直接投資淨減少則抵銷了部分的整體增幅。

二零二五年第三季儲備資產減少1,365億元，而二零二五年第二季則增加1,055億元。

II. 國際投資頭寸

在二零二五年第三季季末，香港的對外金融資產和負債總值均處於很高的水平，分別為595,868億元（相當於本地生產總值的18.2倍）和399,369億元（相當於本地生產總值的12.2倍），這是一個重要國際金融中心常見的特點。

在二零二五年第三季季末，香港的對外金融資產淨值（即資產扣除負債）達196,499億元（相當於本地生產總值的6.0倍），而二零二五年第二季季末則為183,647億元（相當於本地生產總值的5.7倍）。香港的對外金融資產淨值與本地生產總值的比率是世界最大之一，為香港經濟面對突如其來的外來衝擊發揮強大的緩衝作用。

III. 對外債務

在二零二五年第三季季末，香港的對外債務總額為157,461億元（相當於本地生產總值的4.8倍）。與二零二五年第二季季末的154,636億元（亦是相當於本地生產總值的4.8倍）比較，對外債務總額增加2,825億元，這主要歸因於其他界別對外債務的增加，而銀行界別對外債務的增加、直接投資債務負債（公司間借貸）以及香港金融管理局對外債務的增加也起到了推動作用。

作為世界其中一個主要金融中心，香港有大量源於本地銀行界別、透過日常的銀行業務而產生的對外債務。在二零二五年第三季季末，銀行界別的對外債務佔整體的52.3%。其他的對外債務主要包括其他界別的對外債務（29.9%）和直接投資的債務負債（公司間借貸）（16.5%）。

其他資料

國際收支平衡是一項統計報表，有系統地撮錄在一個指定期間內（一般是一年或一季）某經濟體與世界各地之間（即居民與非居民之間）進行的經濟交易。

國際投資頭寸是顯示一個經濟體在某特定時點的對外金融資產及負債存量的資產負債表。對外金融資產及負債總值的差額為該經濟體的國際投資頭寸淨值，等於對非居民的淨金融債權加上作為貨幣黃金持有的金塊。

對外債務總額指一個經濟體的居民在某特定時點欠非居民的實際現有（而並非或有）未償還負債款額。負債人並須於將來某些時點償還本金及／或利息。

表1展示香港國際收支平衡。表2展示詳細的經常賬戶及資本賬戶，而表3則展示詳細的金融賬戶。表4展示香港的國際投資頭寸，而表5則展示香港的對外債務。

二零二五年第三季的國際收支平衡、國際投資頭寸及對外債務統計數字均屬初步數字，日後將根據更新資料修訂。納入統計調查及其他來源的最新資料後，二零二四年的國際收支平衡、國際投資頭寸及對外債務統計數字現已修訂。

行政長官出席港深創新及科技園開園典禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-12-22 16:15,2025-12-22 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200533.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十二月二十二日）出席港深創新及科技園開園典禮的致辭：

尊敬的徐啟方副主任（國務院港澳事務辦公室分管日常工作的副主任）、尊敬的周霽主任（中央政府駐港聯絡辦公室主任）、尊敬的羅晃浩副市長（深圳市副市長）、各位嘉賓、各位市民：

歡迎各位今日齊聚在河套，共同見證香港創科發展的一個里程碑時刻——河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區，今日正式開園！

由香港園區連同深圳園區所組成的河套合作區，是國家「十四五」規劃下粵港澳大灣區的一個重要合作平台。河套的發展目標是要成為世界級創新平台，是國家實現地理上橫跨兩種社會制度、經濟和司法體制優勢，以科技創新為主題的重大合作區。

我衷心感謝中央政府一直以來的大力支持，亦感謝廣東省政府和深圳市政府，多年與特區政府和港深創新及科技園公司緊密合作，共同推動園區構建，實踐「一國兩制」下「一河兩岸」、「一區兩園」的創新理念。

去年，香港特區政府發布了《河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區發展綱要》，闡明香港園區的重點發展方向和策略，全力打造園區成為聯通內地與國際的世界級科技創新樞紐、國家培育發展新質生產力的重要策源地。

今年三月底，我在此出席了園區首三座大樓的平頂儀式，當時與各位提出了我們在此開啓創科新局面的四個理念，包括要以建設為基、以改革為綱、以融合為義、以合作為要，展示香港在創科領域不斷實現突破的決心。今日，港深創新及科技園已進入正式開園時刻，我想與大家介紹園區發展體現的三個關鍵進展。

第一，生動體現創科動力，積極構建高端人才集聚高地。自從園區三座大樓在三月平頂到今日這九個月以來，兩座濕實驗室大樓已有超過60間來自海外、內地及香港的企業和機構簽署租約，已租出約八成的樓面面積。園區設有生物樣本庫、數據中心等讓租戶使用的共用設施，同時，園區的人才公寓亦已迎來首批住客。

世界各地的創科企業和科研人員踴躍進駐園區，以行動投下對香港園區發展的信心一票。我們會積極向全球推廣大灣區建設和河套發展的龐大機遇，繼續吸引各地更多企業和人才一同在這片創科沃土大展鴻圖。

第二，全力實踐科研擴容，加快發展國際創新科技樞紐。香港園區第一批其餘的五座大樓，將會在二○二七年開始陸續完工。同時，香港園區的第二期規劃已經完成，會以凝聚高效市場和有為政府的公私營合作模式，加快建設發展。香港園區兩期發展提供的總樓面面積將達200萬平方米，規模比原本的規劃大增七成，為園區企業提供更多發展空間。

園區在未來將按功能劃分科技區塊，涵蓋生命健康科技、人工智能與數據科學、新科技與先進製造等支柱產業，推動產業有序發展，促進上、中、下游不同階段協同發展，打造完整創科產業鏈，服務大灣區構建國際科技創新中心的宏大目標。

行政長官出席港深創新及科技園開園典禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-12-22 16:15,2025-12-22 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200533.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十二月二十二日）出席港深創新及科技園開園典禮的致辭：

尊敬的徐啟方副主任（國務院港澳事務辦公室分管日常工作的副主任）、尊敬的周霽主任（中央政府駐港聯絡辦公室主任）、尊敬的羅晃浩副市長（深圳市副市長）、各位嘉賓、各位市民：

歡迎各位今日齊聚在河套，共同見證香港創科發展的一個里程碑時刻——河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區，今日正式開園！

由香港園區連同深圳園區所組成的河套合作區，是國家「十四五」規劃下粵港澳大灣區的一個重要合作平台。河套的發展目標是要成為世界級創新平台，是國家實現地理上橫跨兩種社會制度、經濟和司法體制優勢，以科技創新為主題的重大合作區。

我衷心感謝中央政府一直以來的大力支持，亦感謝廣東省政府和深圳市政府，多年與特區政府和港深創新及科技園公司緊密合作，共同推動園區構建，實踐「一國兩制」下「一河兩岸」、「一區兩園」的創新理念。

去年，香港特區政府發布了《河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區發展綱要》，闡明香港園區的重點發展方向和策略，全力打造園區成為聯通內地與國際的世界級科技創新樞紐、國家培育發展新質生產力的重要策源地。

今年三月底，我在此出席了園區首三座大樓的平頂儀式，當時與各位提出了我們在此開啓創科新局面的四個理念，包括要以建設為基、以改革為綱、以融合為義、以合作為要，展示香港在創科領域不斷實現突破的決心。今日，港深創新及科技園已進入正式開園時刻，我想與大家介紹園區發展體現的三個關鍵進展。

第一，生動體現創科動力，積極構建高端人才集聚高地。自從園區三座大樓在三月平頂到今日這九個月以來，兩座濕實驗室大樓已有超過60間來自海外、內地及香港的企業和機構簽署租約，已租出約八成的樓面面積。園區設有生物樣本庫、數據中心等讓租戶使用的共用設施，同時，園區的人才公寓亦已迎來首批住客。

世界各地的創科企業和科研人員踴躍進駐園區，以行動投下對香港園區發展的信心一票。我們會積極向全球推廣大灣區建設和河套發展的龐大機遇，繼續吸引各地更多企業和人才一同在這片創科沃土大展鴻圖。

第二，全力實踐科研擴容，加快發展國際創新科技樞紐。香港園區第一批其餘的五座大樓，將會在二○二七年開始陸續完工。同時，香港園區的第二期規劃已經完成，會以凝聚高效市場和有為政府的公私營合作模式，加快建設發展。香港園區兩期發展提供的總樓面面積將達200萬平方米，規模比原本的規劃大增七成，為園區企業提供更多發展空間。

園區在未來將按功能劃分科技區塊，涵蓋生命健康科技、人工智能與數據科學、新科技與先進製造等支柱產業，推動產業有序發展，促進上、中、下游不同階段協同發展，打造完整創科產業鏈，服務大灣區構建國際科技創新中心的宏大目標。

第三，創新實現合作維度，高效促進跨境創科要素流動。隨着香港園區建設陸續落成，未來將有越來越多企業進駐園區這片創科沃土，園區將提供政策和基礎配套，便利科研人員往返兩地。

Heritage Museum exhibition showcases new creation by Hong Kong artists inspired by ICH (with photos),2025-12-22 15:38,2025-12-22 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200322.htm,"  The Hong Kong Heritage Museum is staging the ""HK Snapshotsâ§City Walks: Fresh Takes on Hong Kong's Art and Cultural Heritage"" exhibition, featuring four groups of young local artists, namely the fourth-generation Lingnan School artist Rebecca Lo, the Hong Kong Cheongsam Association, printing studio ditto ditto, and Key-Point Productions. Through porcelain painting, fashion design, letterpress printing and exhibition installation design, the exhibition presents unique facets of Hong Kong's cityscape and cultural personality. The exhibition will run until March 2 next year, with free admission.

  The exhibition has been on display at the Hong Kong section of the ninth edition of the Hong Kong-Macao Visual Art Biennale since October 2024. It has since travelled to five cities - Hangzhou, Nanjing, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen - and has received an overwhelming response. The exhibition introduced Hong Kong's unique cultural landscape to Mainland audiences. Now, it has returned to Hong Kong with supplementary information about the city's intangible cultural heritage (ICH), delving into the commitment of the artists to preserving, transmitting and innovatively interpreting Hong Kong's ICH and traditional craft skills.

  Lo inherits the painting style of the Lingnan School and incorporates the techniques of Western painting to create five porcelain plate sets. She painted local flowers and birds, natural landscapes, and historic buildings on Jingdezhen's white porcelain. With tireless experimentation with paints and techniques, she crafts new expressive forms, revealing colours and intricate variations on the porcelain with vivid detail.

  The Hong Kong Cheongsam Association, the protection organisation of the national ICH item, has formed a young designer team to create four innovative sets of men's and women's cheongsams. Featuring the city's unique architecture and memories, the team combines traditional ICH craftsmanship and classic tailoring with advanced technologies such as innovative jacquard weaving and 3D printing, promoting this ICH craftsmanship to younger generations.

  Adding personal touches to paper product design with the letterpress printing technique, the printing studio ditto ditto created four sets of printed works, postcards and calendars depicting Hong Kong attractions, scenic spots and cuisine.

  Designers from Key-Point Productions have drawn inspiration from flexible street stalls and have incorporated numerous visual elements from old Hong Kong into four foldable exhibition installations for displaying the three groups of artworks mentioned above.

Waste-to-energy facility IÂ·PARK1 trial operation proceeds smoothly (with photos/video),2025-12-22 15:28,2025-12-22 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200384.htm,"âThe Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (December 22) announced that the Integrated Waste Management Facilities Phase I (I·PARK1) has commenced the first phase of trial operation.

The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan; the Permanent Secretary for Environment and Ecology (Environment), Mr Eddie Cheung; the Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong; and the Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui, recently visited I·PARK1 to inspect its operations, observing various facility sections, including the unloading and tipping of waste compactor containers, waste treatment processes, waste-to-energy equipment, and flue gas treatment and emission control. They were also briefed by the project team on the progress of the trial operation.

Located on an artificial island off Shek Kwu Chau, I·PARK1 adopts advanced waste incineration technology capable of effectively decomposing organic compounds, including dioxins. I·PARK1 consists of three incineration modules, with a designed municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment capacity of 3 000 tonnes per day. At present, the first module, capable of processing 1 000 tonnes of MSW daily, has already commenced trial operation. The remaining two modules will begin phased trial operations at a later stage. The heat recovered from the incineration process is used to generate electricity, not only powering the facility's daily operation but also exporting 480 million kilowatt-hours of electricity to the public power grid, which is enough to power 100 000 households each year.

Following the inspection, Mr Tse said, ""The completion and phased commissioning of I·PARK1 marks the launch of a new approach for managing MSW in Hong Kong beyond reliance on landfills. It signifies a crucial step of Hong Kong toward achieving our target of 'zero waste landfilling' by 2035. In the meantime, we are advancing at full steam the construction of the Integrated Waste Management Facility Phase 2 (I·PARK2) in Tsang Tsui, Tuen Mun, while we remain committed to driving forward various initiatives on waste reduction, recycling, and resource circulation, continuing our progress toward the goal of 'zero waste landfilling' and carbon neutrality.""

Dr Chui said that the EPD has been closely monitoring the trial operation of I·PARK1 to ensure its operation and emissions comply with the stringent safety and environmental standards. Following I·PARK1's progressive commencement of operation, the total amount of MSW transported to West New Territories Landfill and North East New Territories Landfill will be reduced accordingly, alleviating the pressure on the two landfills.

In 2024, a total of 10 510 tonnes of MSW daily was disposed of in Hong Kong. I.PARK1 and the proposed I.PARK2 can treat 9 000 tonnes of MSW in total per day. If Hong Kong society can keep the momentum of waste reduction and increase the recycling rate, there may not be a need to construct I·PARK3 to achieve ""zero waste landfilling""."
轉廢為能設施I·PARK1試行運作順利（附圖／短片）,2025-12-22 15:27,2025-12-22 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200378.htm,"環境保護署（環保署）今日（十二月二十二日）表示，香港首座現代都市固體廢物轉廢為能設施──綜合廢物管理設施第一期（I·PARK1）已進入首階段試行運作。

環境及生態局局長謝展寰、環境及生態局常任秘書長（環境）張國財、環境及生態局副局長黃淑嫻及環保署署長徐浩光博士日前到訪I·PARK1視察其運作情況，實地了解設施的運作，包括壓縮貨櫃上岸及傾卸、廢物處理程序、轉廢為能設備和煙氣及排放處理等，並聽取了工程團隊匯報試運情況。

I·PARK1位於石鼓洲旁人工島上，採用先進的焚化技術，能有效分解包括二噁英在內的有機化合物。該設施共設有三個焚化模組，處理量為每日3 000公噸都市固體廢物。目前，第一個焚化模組已進入試行運作階段，每日可處理1 000公噸都市固體廢物，其餘兩個模組亦將於稍後分階段開始試行運作。焚燒處理過程中產生的熱能將用作發電，除供設施日常運作外，每年可輸出約4億8 000萬度電力至公眾電網，足夠供10萬戶家庭使用一年。

謝展寰在視察後表示：「I·PARK1的落成及陸續投入服務，為香港廢物管理開啓新篇章，把都市固體廢物轉化成能源，減少對堆填區的依賴，標誌着香港踏出了達致在二○三五年都市固體廢物『零廢堆填』的重要一步。我們現正全力推進於屯門曾咀興建第二座轉廢為能設施I·PARK2，配合持續推行的減廢回收和資源循環的工作，香港正穩步邁向『零廢堆填』及碳中和的目標，創建綠色未來。」

徐浩光博士表示，環保署會密切監察I·PARK1的試行運作，確保其運作和排放符合嚴格的安全和環保標準。隨着I·PARK1陸續投入服務，現時運往新界西及新界東北堆填區的都市固體廢物總量將會相應降低，舒緩兩個堆填區處理廢物的壓力。

二○二四年，香港都市固體廢物總棄置量為每日10 510公噸，I·PARK1及擬建的I·PARK2每日合共可處理9 000公噸固體廢物，若香港社會可以繼續減廢和增加回收量，可望無須興建第三個焚化爐而達到「零廢堆填」的目標。"
食環署持續落實規管私人泳池救生員措施,2025-12-22 15:00,2025-12-22 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200227.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）發言人今日（十二月二十二日）表示，為保障泳池使用者的安全，食環署自今年五月起實施一系列加強規管私人泳池救生員的措施，至今運作暢順並達致預期效果。食環署將持續推行該等措施。

截至十一月三十日，食環署今年於不同時段對全港逾1 400個持牌私人泳池進行約11 000次巡查，並透過中國香港拯溺總會核實超過5 000個救生員資格，當中發現一宗懷疑有救生員使用虛假救生員證件的個案。食環署已就事件報警，並就泳池開放期間未有提供足夠合資格救生員向有關泳池持牌人提出檢控。其後，該泳池持牌人因違反《泳池規例》（第132CA章第12條）在裁判法院被判罪名成立，罰款8,000元；而不合資格的救生員亦因欺詐罪及以欺騙手段取得金錢利益罪被警方起訴，在裁判法院被判罪名成立，判處監禁兩個月。此外，食環署亦發現兩宗懷疑未有提供足夠合資格救生員的個案，並已展開調查，如有足夠證據會提出檢控。同期，食環署人員在巡查期間就泳池持牌人違反與救生員有關的牌照條件共發出13個口頭警告，涉及未有在泳池入口展示在場當值的救生員數目及未有妥善填寫或保存救生員每日當值紀錄等。

發言人說：「整體而言，絕大部分泳池均遵守與救生員有關的規定，而食環署的巡查亦能有效找出違規個案。食環署會持續執行各項措施，保障泳池使用者的安全。」

發言人強調，泳池持牌人必須嚴格履行核實救生員資格的責任，確保泳池開放期間有足夠的合資格救生員當值。食環署提醒所有泳池持牌人，切勿聘用不合資格的救生員或容許使用虛假資格的救生員當值，並須嚴格遵守《泳池規例》（第132CA章）及其他牌照條件。如發現違規情況，署方會嚴肅跟進。

食環署自今年五月十九日起實施一系列加強規管私人泳池救生員的措施，包括在不同時段增加巡查頻次、規定持牌人在聘用救生員前須核對其身分證明文件並將其救生章和救生手冊的副本存檔、引入新懲處機制、加強與中國香港拯溺總會及物業管理業監管局合作等。"

FEHD continues to implement regulatory measures for life-saving attendants at private swimming pools,2025-12-22 15:00,2025-12-22 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200229.htm,"A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (December 22) that, to safeguard swimming pool users, the FEHD has implemented a series of enhancement measures regulating life-saving attendants at private swimming pools from May this year. The FEHD will continue to implement these measures, which have been operating smoothly to date and have achieved the intended results.

As at November 30, the FEHD had conducted approximately 11 000 inspections at various times of the day across over 1 400 licensed private swimming pools in Hong Kong, and had verified over 5 000 lifeguard qualifications through the Hong Kong China Life Saving Society (HKLSS) this year. One case involving suspected use of a fraudulent life-saving attendant certificate was identified. The FEHD reported it to the Police and prosecuted the swimming pool licensee for failing to provide a sufficient number of qualified life-saving attendants during pool opening hours. The licensee concerned was subsequently convicted by the magistrates' court for contravening the Swimming Pools Regulation (Section 12 of Cap. 132CA) and fined $8,000. The unqualified life-saving attendant who used the fraudulent qualification was also prosecuted by the Police and sentenced to two months' imprisonment for the offences of ""fraud"" and ""obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception"". In addition, two other suspected cases of insufficient provision of qualified life-saving attendants were found and the FEHD has initiated investigations. Prosecutions will be instituted should there be sufficient evidence. During the inspections over the same period, FEHD officers issued a total of 13 verbal warnings against licensees for violating the licensing conditions relating to life-saving attendants. These warnings involved failures to display at the pool entrances the number of life-saving attendants on duty and to properly complete or maintain life-saving attendants' daily duty records.

The spokesman said, ""Overall, most of the swimming pools were in compliance with the regulations relating to life-saving attendants, and the FEHD's inspections were effective in identifying suspected violations. The FEHD will continue to execute the measures to ensure the safety of swimming pool users.""

The spokesman stressed that swimming pool licensees are required to strictly fulfill their responsibility of verifying the qualifications of life-saving attendants and ensuring sufficient qualified life-saving attendants are on duty while the pool is open. The FEHD reminded all swimming pool licensees not to employ unqualified life-saving attendants or permit those with fraudulent qualifications to be on duty, and to strictly observe the Swimming Pools Regulation (Cap. 132CA) and other licensing conditions. The FEHD will take stringent follow-up actions against any violation identified.

Since May 19 this year, the FEHD has implemented a series of enhanced measures to strengthen the regulation of lifeguards at private swimming pools. These include stepping up inspection frequency at different times of the day, requiring licensees to verify the identity documents of life-saving attendants before employment and to keep copies of their Pool Lifeguard Awards and personal logbooks on proper record, introducing a new penalty mechanism and strengthening co-operation with HKLSS and the Property Management Services Authority."

Waste statistics for 2024 published,2025-12-22 13:11,2025-12-22 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200312.htm,"The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (December 22) published the report ""Monitoring of Solid Waste in Hong Kong - Waste Statistics for 2024"". It presents the 2024 statistics on disposal and recovery/recycling of solid waste generated in Hong Kong, including municipal solid waste (MSW) (covering both domestic waste and commercial and industrial waste), overall construction waste and special waste.

The total quantity of MSW disposed of at landfills has dropped for three consecutive years to 3.85 million tonnes in 2024, and the average daily quantity was 10 510 tonnes, representing a decrease of 3.4 per cent comparing with the average of 10 884 tonnes in 2023. Among these, disposal of waste plastics has dropped by 11.1 per cent; disposal of food waste has dropped by 6.0 per cent; disposal of waste glass has decreased by 7.1 per cent. The per capita MSW disposal rate per day was 1.40 kilograms, down from 1.44 kilograms in 2023 by 3.3 per cent. Among the three major categories of MSW in 2024, food waste accounted for 29 per cent, followed by waste paper and waste plastics, accounting for 23 per cent and 18 per cent respectively.

With the implementation of various measures by the Government in promoting food waste recycling and plastic-free culture, including the implementation of the regulation on disposable plastic products in 2024, both the shares of disposal of food waste and waste plastics had decreased compared to 2023. The drop in the disposal amount of waste plastics also reflected the increasing global awareness of being ""plastic-free"" in recent years and the effectiveness of the Government's active promotion of various related measures. Since the Government enhanced the Plastic Shopping Bag Charging Scheme on December 31, 2022, the amount of plastic shopping bags disposed in 2024 has dropped to 56 408 tonnes, down from 63 367 tonnes in 2023 by 11 per cent. Meanwhile, the share of waste paper has increased; this was mainly paper waste other than cardboard, newsprint, office paper or tetrapak that could not be easily recycled.

The overall MSW recovery rate has risen for four consecutive years. The latest figures show that it rose from 33 per cent in 2023 to 34 per cent in 2024 and the increase in the total recovery amount was about 50000 tonnes. The increase was mainly driven by the recycling of food waste (around 26000 tonnes) and ferrous metal recyclables (around 53000 tonnes).

An EPD spokesperson said that in order to achieve the vision of ""Waste Reductionâ§Resources Circulationâ§Zero Landfill"" by 2035, the current term Government is working at full steam to promote the culture of waste reduction and recovery, and to encourage active participation in waste reduction by citizens through the community recycling network GREEN@COMMUNITY and the food waste collection network. The latest statistics show that the current-term Government has successfully reversed the long-term upward trend in waste disposal quantities. The recovery rate showed a continuous upward trend, reflecting the achievements of the Government's persistent effort in promoting waste reduction and recovery.

Regarding construction waste, the overall quantity of construction waste generation in 2024 increased by about 4 945 tonnes per day (11 per cent) as compared to 2023, to 50 505 tonnes per day on average. The quantity of construction waste disposed of at landfills increased slightly by 6 per cent to about 4 694 tonnes per day. The construction activities performed by the main contractors in the same period increased by 6.3% compared to 2023. The overall construction waste recovery rate was above 90 per cent; the average quantity of construction waste reused was 45 810 tonnes per day.

The Government will continue to encourage small-scale works to properly dispose of construction waste in a compliant and paid manner through publicity and education, strengthened enforcement actions, as well as a pilot scheme to assist with collection of construction waste. The EPD also encourages private enterprises to upcycle construction waste into products like eco-blocks, ceramic products and outdoor paving materials. In terms of land, there is an enterprise operating construction waste recycling facilities in the EcoPark, and the EPD has also provided land for short-term lease for the purpose of recycling construction waste. Moreover, the Recycling Fund has also subsidised different enterprises' projects on upcycling of construction waste.

Looking ahead, seizing the opportunity of increasing public participation in waste reduction and recycling, the Government will further promote a green waste reduction and recycling culture in society and will take forward waste reduction and recycling initiatives along four directions, namely: (1) Strengthen publicity and education to change public behaviour and cultivate a green living culture; (2) Continue to enhance the recycling network; (3) Strengthen collaboration with industries to explore and take forward practical environmental protection measures; (4) Utilise market forces to develop environmental infrastructure and assist in the transition to a green economy.

In the meantime, the Government is building an advanced and efficient network of modern waste-to-energy facilities at full steam. The first waste-to-energy facility for treating municipal solid waste, Integrated Waste Management Facilities Phase 1 (I·PARK1), commenced operation at the end of this year; and the Government is also working in full steam on the preparation work for Integrated Waste Management Facility Phase 2 (I·PARK2) to expand waste-to-energy capacity. The goal is to achieve zero landfill with the efforts of the HKSAR Government and citizens.

The report and ""Hong Kong 2024 Municipal Solid Waste - At a Glance"" are both available in electronic format and can be obtained from the EPD website at www.wastereduction.gov.hk/en/assistancewizard/waste_red_sat.htm."

隨着政府近年積極推行各項廚餘回收措施和推動多項「走塑」措施，包括二○二四年實施管制即棄塑膠法例，廚餘及廢塑膠所佔比重均較二○二三年下降。廢塑膠棄置量的跌幅亦正好反映近年全球「走塑」意識日益提升，以及政府積極推動多項相關措施的成效。政府二○二二年十二月三十一日優化塑膠購物袋收費計劃，二○二四年的數字顯示購物膠袋棄置量持續下降至56408公噸，較二○二三年的63367公噸減少11%。與此同時，廢紙的比重有所增加，主要是難以回收的雜紙。

都市固體廢物回收率連續四年上升，最新由二○二三年的33%升至二○二四年的34%，總回收量增加約5.0萬公噸，增長主要由廚餘（約2.6萬公噸）及含鐵金屬（約5.3萬公噸）所帶動。

環保署發言人指，為達致二○三五年「全民減廢‧資源循環‧零廢堆填」的願景，本屆政府著力推動綠色減廢回收文化，透過「綠在區區」社區回收網絡及廚餘回收網絡，推動市民積極參與減廢回收。最新統計數字顯示本屆政府成功扭轉廢物棄置量長期上升的趨勢，而回收率則持續上升，政府推動減廢回收的努力均取得顯著成效。

至於建築廢物方面，二○二四年建築廢物整體產生量較二○二三年每日增加約4 945公噸（11%）至平均每日50 505公噸。送往堆填區處理的建築廢物量輕微增加約6%，至約每日4 694公噸。同期主要承建商所完成的建造工程活動亦較二○二三年上升6.3%。然而，整體建築廢物重用率已超過90%，為平均每日45 810公噸。

政府會繼續透過宣傳教育、強化執法行動以及協助小型工程收集建築廢物的先導計劃，鼓勵小型工程將建築廢物作合規及付費的妥善棄置。環保署亦鼓勵私人企業將建築廢物升級再造，製成如環保磚、陶瓷製品及戶外鋪地等材料。土地方面，現時環保園已有企業營運建築廢物循環再造設施，環保署亦有為回收再用建築廢物提供短期租約用地。此外，回收基金亦資助不同企業的建築廢物升級再造項目。

展望未來，政府會把握愈來愈多市民參與減廢回收的契機，進一步推動社會建立綠色減廢回收文化，並會循四個方向繼續推動減少廢物和分類回收，包括（一）多用宣傳教育，改變市民行為，打造綠色生活文化；（二）持續完善回收網絡；（三）緊密與行業協作，共同探索和推進務實可行的環境保護措施；以及（四）善用市場力量發展環境基建，協助綠色經濟轉型。

同時，政府正全力發展先進高效的現代轉廢為能設施網絡，首座處理都市固體廢物的轉廢為能設施I·PARK1於今年年底開始陸續投入服務；政府亦正全力推展第二座轉廢為能設施I·PARK2的籌備工作，擴大轉廢為能的容量，配合特區政府推動市民努力實踐減廢回收，向「零廢堆填」的目標穩步邁進。

​運輸及物流局局長與路政署署長就中九龍繞道（油麻地段）通車後首個工作天交通情況會見傳媒談話內容,2025-12-22 12:55,2025-12-22 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200332.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（十二月二十二日）上午視察中九龍繞道（油麻地段）通車後首個工作天交通情況後，與路政署署長邱國鼎會見傳媒的談話內容：

運輸及物流局局長：早晨，各位傳媒朋友、各位市民。中九龍繞道（油麻地段）昨日（十二月二十一日）通車，今日迎來首個工作天，至今已有逾五萬車次使用中九龍繞道（油麻地段）。我看到今早的交通情況大致暢順，符合預期。由於繞道扮演分流的角色，亦能貫穿九龍區東、西走向的交通道路，所以我們觀察到加士居道天橋、龍翔道一帶九龍區主要幹道的交通情況有很明顯改善，相當暢順。運輸署緊急事故交通協調中心自星期六（十二月二十日）晚上已提升至最高級別的督導模式，至今一直監察着整體交通狀況，我們一定會繼續密切留意交通情況。

我們留意到昨日繞道通車後，不少駕駛人士和公共交通車輛均有使用繞道，初時大家都需要多適應路況，亦要留意指示牌。公共交通方面，今日起有八條專營巴士路線途經繞道，至今已有16班巴士開出，包括由將軍澳往機場的數班機場巴士，乘客量不俗。我在此再次呼籲大家，使用繞道時一定要確保道路安全。我稍後會請路政署署長向大家匯報，我們經考慮整日的運作情況後，如何在交通路牌和指示方面作出優化和加強。

路政署署長：如局長剛才提到，中九龍繞道（油麻地段）其實是一條策略性道路，每邊無論在油麻地方向及啟德九龍灣方向，其實都有多個出口，每邊達到四個出口。我們看到昨日都真是需要時間讓駕駛者適應，初步看到昨日駕駛者（遇到的情況），其實最主要在中九龍繞道啟德九龍灣段出口，我們建議有三大改善方向。

第一，由於有四個出口，從左邊往啟德九龍灣，然後觀塘繞道，跟着兩條線去郵輪碼頭，雖然我們本來有足夠指示交通標誌，但我們決定為了方便駕駛者看到，我們會在路面做多一個道路標記，就是加在路面四條行車線上，就是左邊的啟德九龍灣、觀塘繞道和兩個往郵輪碼頭。我們會髹兩組，第一組剛剛在昨晚已大部分完成。第二組在差不多近行政大樓，會於今晚完成。即是說，明早除兩組交通標誌外，還有道路標記，提醒駕駛者選定適當行車線。

第二，大家留意到在啟福道，由於在啟德隧道出來的車輛已經不能再直接上觀塘繞道，而是要經常怡道及宏照道到觀塘繞道。我們留意到有些車輛入了巴士線再上觀塘繞道。我們在巴士線前加了一對警告交通標誌，是紅底白字的一對（標誌）於兩旁，提醒（駕駛者）前面有巴士專線，其他車輛不准駛入。我們看到今早的情況，配合警察執法，情況已有改善。

第三，在九龍灣方面。九龍灣入口處，有兩條隧道供駕駛者選擇，分別是啟德隧道及中九龍繞道。由於有兩個隧道標誌，我們會再在適當位置提醒（駕駛者有）該兩條隧道（選擇），譬如是去油麻地、啟德，或者經啟德隧道，可能會標示所經的隧道。

這三大改善方向我們會繼續做，如剛才所述，第二組道路標記會在今晚完成；啟福道巴士線交通標誌已經完成；而提醒（駕駛者）選用隧道的指示交通標誌，我們希望在這幾日短時間內加強。

記者：繞道落成後，估計由西隧經中九龍幹線進入觀塘的車流量是多少？如果車流不多，會否考慮開放啟福道右線，改劃為單白線，讓啟德隧道車輛駛上觀塘繞道？

運輸及物流局局長：今日是中九龍繞道（油麻地段）開通第二日，是一個工作天，由於臨近年底，部分學校或已開始放假，所以我們要密切留意實際交通情況。正如路政署署長剛才提到，繞道的啟德出口有接近八個出口，我們要做好分流。在啟德方面，尤其是啟福道及通往九龍灣區域方面，我們亦就相應路口和交通燈作出調整，並及早準備預案，以配合調整的路線。我們會繼續密切留意交通情況，期望道路使用者能因應出行需要，享受暢順的交通安排。

記者：剛才訪問了一些巴士乘客，今日是通車後首個工作天，他們表示巴士在進入繞道前有慢行和輕微擠塞的情況，並非他們預期之內。現時正值年底，小朋友不用上學，會否擔心未來分流的效果未如理想，繞道會出現擠塞？政府屆時會有甚麼應對措施？另外，昨日有意見反映路牌的文字較多及較細，除了地面會再加標示外，路牌會否有改善？

運輸及物流局局長：中九龍繞道（油麻地段）是一條主要的分流幹道，由於車速高，且屬一條直接連接的幹道，能發揮很好的分流功能，有很大吸引力。繞道通車後，使油麻地至啟德的車程由以往30分鐘大大縮減至五分鐘，因此在最初規劃繞道時，我們已預期會有一定的交通需求。整體而言，繞道日後會實施收費安排。目前我們因應繁忙時段加設專營巴士路線途經繞道，為市民提供兩個選擇：部分專營巴士的路線會經繞道行駛，亦有路線經太子道或亞皆老街，讓乘客可有不同選擇。整體交通情況是動態的，路政署及運輸署會繼續密切留意交通情況及乘客需求，以便我們更好地作出回應及優化交通安排。

記者：留意到今早有警員在啟福道巴士線截停一些違例車輛，現時警察會如何處理，會提出勸喻抑或執法？既然這麼多車輛需要由啟福道上觀塘繞道，會否改善這個問題？另外，我們看到有很多車輛在啟德出口行錯路、切雙白線的情況，會否考慮加設緩衝區和劃多些虛線，使車輛可以及早改道，以改善情況？

運輸及物流局局長：關於啟德出口，我們昨晚已在隧道內路面加強標示，讓駕駛者可預早留意到交通路牌，從而選取適合的路線。我們亦已在隧道出口，即啟福道附近加裝一些警告標示，讓駕駛者留意，以避免錯誤駛進巴士專線。我們很感謝警方一直配合繞道的通車，並在通車後首個工作天安排警員協助留意現場情況，最主要是確保道路安全。我們會繼續審視情況，未來一、兩日持續和加快優化及加強路牌指示的安排。我亦很感謝團隊能快速作出應變。

記者：有關巴士專線方面，不少司機反映設計造成不便，他們似乎並非不知道巴士專線的安排，而是貪快而越過雙白線。其實這個設計的原本目的是甚麼？車輛要駛至九龍灣MegaBox的位置才出觀塘繞道，會否擔心加劇MegaBox附近塞車情況？

運輸及物流局局長：首先，巴士專線是為確保專營巴士的出行安全，我在此呼籲駕駛者要留意巴士專線的安排，注意駕駛安全。我們已加設警示路牌，正正能協助駕駛者避免錯誤地切入巴士專線。藉着中九龍繞道（油麻地段）通車，我們在啟福道作的分流安排，是為改善九龍灣MegaBox一帶以往出現的交通擠塞情況。運輸署和路政署於數月前已分別在該處一帶作出交通改善措施，調整交通燈訊號，希望車輛駛入九龍灣地段時會較以往暢順，這亦回應了過去一些地區人士提出的意見，今次我們則一併去做。始終今日仍是通車第二日，我們希望駕駛人士保持耐性、小心出行。我們會一直觀察他們的駕駛情況，密切和動態地留意安排。接下來隨着交通標示的加強，交通情況有望更安全和暢順。

Remarks by STL on traffic conditions on first working day following commissioning of Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section) at media session,2025-12-22 12:55,2025-12-22 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200324.htm,"Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at a media session today (December 22) with the Director of Highways, Mr Tony Yau, after inspecting the traffic conditions on the first working day following the commissioning of the Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section):

Secretary for Transport and Logistics: Following the successful commissioning of the Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section) yesterday, by now we have seen a total of 50 000 vehicles of traffic throughput at this bypass. The overall traffic condition is smooth. We noticed a significant improvement in the diversion effect of the bypass in improving the traffic conditions along the Gascoigne Road Flyover and other major roads in the Kowloon district. We appeal to various road users to take care of road safety and to pay attention to the road signs. In general, the usage of the bypass is smooth.

As we can see from media reports, there were different kinds of road users using the bypass yesterday, including pet buses, open-deck buses and motorcyclists. From media reports, we can also see that every citizen shared the joy and excitement of using this bypass. The successful launch of this bypass represents not only a significant improvement in the traffic conditions but also the ingenious efforts of various engineers, contractors and consultants throughout the years in constructing and designing this infrastructure.

In particular, we have to thank the Legislative Council for providing staunch support for us in monitoring the overall construction of this infrastructure. We have invited previous, incumbent and also Members-elect of the Legislative Council to our ceremony yesterday. With the success of the Legislative Council election, we look forward to continuing our collaboration with the Members-elect of the Legislative Council in order to further improve the development of traffic infrastructure in Hong Kong, which is very important to the economic development of the whole society.

Thank you very much.

"DH accepts applications for one-on-one pre-new drug application meetings under ""1+"" mechanism",2025-12-22 12:28,2025-12-22 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200283.htm,"  The Department of Health (DH) announced today (December 22) that potential applicants for new drugs registration through the ""1+"" mechanism may now request one-on-one pre-new drug application (NDA) meetings with immediate effect. This service aims to further optimise the new drug registration approval process by working with the pharmaceutical industry to achieve the goals of early consultation to enhance quality and efficiency throughout the process so that registration approval can be expedited in Hong Kong. It will consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international health and medical innovation hub.

Consultation service for new drug applications under ""1+"" mechanism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The introduction of the consultation service under the ""1+"" mechanism will enhance efficiency in processing applications. The consultation service comprises three components, namely briefing seminars, workshops and pre-NDA meetings.
  
  There are two types of pre-NDA meetings that provide tailored services and appropriate support for applicants with different needs. These meetings help potential applicants plan their applications earlier and more comprehensively, while streamlining the submission process. Details are as follows:


Company-oriented: Meetings are specifically for first-time applicants through the ""1+"" mechanism. DH professionals will provide tailored advice and guidance on applicable drug registration categories and application pathways based on the applicant company's profiles and potential registration applications; and
	
Product-specific: Meetings are tailored to specific new drug registration projects. DH professionals will provide concrete advice on the supporting evidence, procedures and documentation required for the particular new drug registration.


Information on how to apply for one-on-one pre-NDA meetings has been uploaded on the ""1+"" mechanism thematic webpage. To encourage the industry to experience the one-on-one pre-NDA meetings, no fees will be charged for this service at this stage. The DH will actively maintain communication with the industry to gather feedback and suggestions regarding the one-on-one pre-NDA meetings.

Since March of this year, the DH has organised seven briefing seminars to brief the trade and stakeholders on the basic requirements and procedures for Hong Kong drug registration under the ""1+"" mechanism. The DH has also organised three workshops to provide guidance and share good practices and real-life experiences on submitting applications through the ""1+"" mechanism. These seminars and workshops have been well received by over 580 representatives from pharmaceutical companies, consultancy firms and research institutes, etc, in and outside Hong Kong. The DH has uploaded the detailed arrangements and briefing materials for the seminar to the thematic webpage on the ""1+"" mechanism. The DH will continue to organise workshops and briefing seminars as needed based on feedback from the industry.

Paving the way towards primary evaluation
------------------------------------------------

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has implemented the ""1+"" mechanism since November 1, 2023, and has extended it to all new drugs from November 1 last year, including all new chemical or biological entities and new indications, and vaccines and advanced therapy products. Under the ""1+"" mechanism, new drugs which are supported by local clinical data and recognised by local relevant experts can be applied for registration in Hong Kong by submitting approval from the drug regulatory authority of one of the reference places (instead of two in the past).

Since the implementation of the ""1+"" mechanism, a total of 16 new drugs have been approved under this mechanism. Seven of them have been listed in the Hospital Authority Drug Formulary. The DH has been promoting the ""1+"" mechanism through different channels and so far has received more than 700 enquiries from over 180 pharmaceutical companies (including those from the Chinese Mainland and overseas).

  The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address announced that the HKSAR Government will accelerate the reform of the regulatory system for drugs and medical devices. The DH will continue to expedite the ""1+"" mechanism for new drugs by piloting the priority evaluation and approval of innovative drugs as recommended by the Hospital Authority for treatment of severe or rare diseases and to accelerate patients' use of the advanced treatments. In addition, the DH will establish the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation by the end of 2026, and will implement ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration in phases beginning in 2026. These efforts will provide strong momentum for the development and market expansion of the healthcare industry in the HKSAR, the Chinese Mainland, and beyond."

粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所邁進新里程　真實世界研究及應用中心正式成立並同步啓動粵港澳大灣區臨床試驗協作平台,2025-12-22 10:30,2025-12-22 10:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200199.htm,"醫務衞生局今日（十二月二十二日）公布，由香港特別行政區政府設立並全資擁有的「粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所」（試驗所）正式成立「真實世界研究及應用中心」（中心），並同步啓動「粵港澳大灣區臨床試驗協作平台」（協作平台），標誌着試驗所繼去年與深圳粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗中心以「一所一中心」模式同步成立後，在推動粵港澳大灣區生物醫藥領域協同發展方面再邁出重要一步。

中心將善用香港獨有的醫療數據優勢，提升健康和醫療數據庫的存取與應用，並整合在「港澳藥械通」政策下產生的真實世界數據，以支援創新藥械在香港、內地及海外的註冊申請，加速產品研發、審批及上市。截至今年十二月十日，「港澳藥械通」指定內地醫療機構（共71間）引進港澳已上市藥械品種共140種，包括63種藥品及77種醫療器械，惠及超過1.7萬人次。

為積極推動大灣區多中心臨床試驗與真實世界研究的發展，試驗所早已展開前瞻性部署。其中，試驗所在今年九月九日已經與香港大學李嘉誠醫學院及國際生物製藥公司葛蘭素史克簽署三方合作備忘錄，啓動試驗所首個真實世界數據研究項目。該項目將以香港為起點，並計劃逐步擴展至澳門及深圳等大灣區城市。在該項目下，中心將致力探索運用大灣區醫療數據支持藥物在內地註冊上市的創新路徑，從而加速創新醫療產品的研發與審批進程。項目目前正處於方案籌備階段，預計於明年第二季度正式啓動數據收集，標誌着香港在建設真實世界研究國際樞紐，以及就促進大灣區醫療數據互聯互通方面邁出關鍵一步。

此外，中心會積極推動數據應用以支援實證決策，從而優化治療方案和提升醫療系統效能，並將香港定位為真實世界研究的領先地區與國際樞紐，吸引全球合作與投資。中心的服務範疇包括：（一）利用真實世界數據評估研究可行性及為臨床試驗識別合適的研究中心；（二）為在香港及大灣區其他城市進行的真實世界研究提供全面的一站式項目管理；以及（三）提供真實世界研究領域的專家諮詢、專業培訓與能力建設等。

同步啓動的協作平台是「一所一中心」共同建立的統一服務門戶，旨在整合大灣區臨床試驗資源，為全球的生物醫藥企業、研發機構及研究人員提供一站式服務入口。協作平台將統一處理來自海內外的服務請求，透過構建中的香港臨床試驗資訊平台，按具體需求精準配對合適的研究機構與研究者。平台亦提供涵蓋醫藥學、統計、法規事務及倫理審查的全方位專家諮詢。在此框架下，試驗所將致力推動創新療法的臨床試驗，重點聚焦於罕見病藥、高端腫瘤藥，以及細胞與基因療法等先進療法製品。此外，協作平台亦將擔當多重角色，包括作為收集、儲存和分析真實世界數據的主要樞紐，並推動試點項目；作為資訊中心，建立「大灣區臨床研究人才儲備庫」，提供包括《藥物臨牀試驗質量管理規範》及先進療法等專業培訓課程；長遠更會透過建立深港協同機制，定期交換審查標準，探索倫理審查互認的可能性，以提升審批效率。

試驗所將會更好地結合大灣區的完整生物醫藥技術研發及科技產業鏈，善用國家惠港的特別政策如「港澳藥械通」和相關跨境便利措施，充分發揮香港「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的「超級聯繫人」作用，推動河套成為創新生物醫藥成果轉化「引進來、走出去」的窗口，加快大灣區病人獲得先進診療，發展新質生產力。"
GBA International Clinical Trial Institute reaches new milestone with official establishment of Real-World Study and Application Centre and simultaneous launch of GBA Clinical Trial Collaboration Platform,2025-12-22 10:30,2025-12-22 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200201.htm,"  The Health Bureau announced today (December 22) that the Greater Bay Area (GBA) International Clinical Trial Institute (GBAICTI), established and wholly owned by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, officially established the Real-World Study and Application Centre (RWSAC), and simultaneously launched the GBA Clinical Trial Collaboration Platform. This marks another significant step forward in promoting the co-ordinated development of the biomedical field in the GBA, following the simultaneous establishment of the GBAICTI and the GBA International Clinical Trials Center in Shenzhen under the ""one institute, one center"" model last year.

  The RWSAC will leverage Hong Kong's unique advantages in medical data to enhance access to and the application of health and medical databases, and integrate real-world data generated under the special measure of using Hong Kong-registered drugs and medical devices used in Hong Kong public hospitals in the GBA (the Measure), with a view to supporting registration applications for innovative drugs and medical devices in Hong Kong, the Mainland and overseas, thereby accelerating product research and development (R&D), approval and market launch. As of December 10 this year, designated Mainland healthcare institutions (71 in total) under the Measure have introduced a total of 140 drug and medical device products listed in Hong Kong and Macao, comprising 63 drugs and 77 medical devices, benefiting over 17 000 patient visits.

  To actively promote the development of multicentre clinical trials and real-world studies in the GBA, the GBAICTI has already commenced forward-looking planning; such as signing a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding with the LKS Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong and the international biopharmaceutical company GSK on September 9 this year to launch the GBAICTI's first real-world data research project. The project will start in Hong Kong and plans to gradually expand to other GBA cities such as Macao and Shenzhen. The RWSAC will strive to explore innovative pathways for using GBA medical data to support drug registration and market entry on the Mainland under the project, thereby accelerating the R&D and approval processes for innovative medical products. The project is currently in the protocol preparation stage, with data collection expected to officially commence in the second quarter next year, marking a critical step for Hong Kong in becoming an international hub for real-world studies and promoting the interconnectivity of medical data in the GBA.

  In addition, the RWSAC will actively promote data application to support evidence-based decision-making, thereby optimising treatment strategies and enhancing healthcare system efficiency, and position Hong Kong as a leading region and international hub for real-world studies to attract global collaboration and investment. The scope of services of the RWSAC includes: (i) utilising real-world data to assess research feasibility and identify suitable research centres for clinical trials; (ii) providing comprehensive one-stop project management for real-world studies conducted in Hong Kong and other GBA cities; and (iii) offering expert consultation, professional training and capacity building in the field of real-world studies.

  The simultaneously launched Collaboration Platform is a unified service portal jointly established by the ""one institute, one center"", aiming to integrate GBA clinical trial resources and provide a one-stop service entry point for global biomedical enterprises, R&D institutions and researchers. The Collaboration Platform will centrally handle service requests from the Mainland and overseas, and precisely match suitable research institutions and researchers based on specific needs through the Hong Kong Clinical Trial Digital Portal currently under construction. The platform also provides comprehensive expert consultation covering medicine, statistics, regulatory affairs and ethics review. Under this framework, the GBAICTI will strive to promote clinical trials of innovative therapies, focusing on rare disease drugs, high-end cancer drugs, and advanced therapy products such as cell and gene therapies. Furthermore, the Collaboration Platform will take on multiple roles, including serving as a key hub for collecting, storing and analysing real-world data and promoting pilot projects; acting as an information centre to establish a GBA clinical research talent pool and providing professional training courses including the Good Clinical Practice and advanced therapies. In the long run, it will help explore the possibility of the mutual recognition of ethics reviews through establishing a Shenzhen-Hong Kong collaborative mechanism and regularly exchanging review standards to enhance approval efficiency.

  The GBAICTI will better integrate with the complete biomedical technology R&D and technology industry chain in the GBA, leverage the nation's special policy initiatives benefitting Hong Kong such as the Measure and relevant cross-boundary facilitation measures, and give full play to Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world. It will promote the Hetao area as a window for translation of innovative biomedical research results to go global and attract foreign investment, expedite GBA patients' access to advanced treatments, and develop new quality productive forces."
