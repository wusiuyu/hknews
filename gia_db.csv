律政司副司長在涉外法治建設進程中律師與仲裁行業發展業務交流會致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-29 18:23,2025-10-29 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/29/P2025102800576.htm,"​ 以下是律政司副司長張國鈞博士今日（十月二十九日）在珠海國際仲裁院、珠海市司法局及廣東省律師協會主辦的涉外法治建設進程中律師與仲裁行業發展業務交流會的視像致辭：

各位領導、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：

大家下午好。感謝珠海國際仲裁院、珠海市司法局及廣東省律師協會的邀請。雖然今日我未能親身出席交流會，但十分高興可以透過視頻參與其中。

香港的獨特優勢是背靠祖國、聯通世界。香港的仲裁體系，正好體現這一點。根據最新的國際調查，香港獲選為全球第二、亞太區第一受歡迎的仲裁地，充分證明香港獲國際社會高度認可和信賴。香港的《仲裁條例》採納《示範法》（《國際商事仲裁示範法》），與國際接軌，未來我們也會積極研究修訂條例，確保香港的仲裁法律框架與時並進，符合市場的最新需求。

同時，香港與內地多年來在仲裁領域深化合作，也是香港具備獨特優勢的原因。在法律機制對接方面，兩地落實了《仲裁保全安排》（《關於內地與香港特別行政區法院就仲裁程序相互協助保全的安排》）和《執行安排》（《關於內地與香港特別行政區相互執行仲裁裁決的安排》），法律協助貫穿整個仲裁程序，讓當事人可以申請跨境保全，以及跨境執行裁決，更好保障各方的合法利益。

律政司積極推進大灣區涉外法治建設，並樂意貢獻香港的力量，發揮香港獨特的優勢。我們很高興今年二月迎來了規則銜接方面的重大突破，就是「港資港法」與「港資港仲裁」措施的擴展，而珠海也是其中一個試點城市，可以同時適用這兩項措施。

措施的擴展為企業提供了更多選擇，更靈活和更國際化的法律保障，深受商界包括海外商會的歡迎。落地至今，措施已取得顯著成效，有深圳仲裁機構成功處理選擇「港仲裁」的相關案件。期待珠海國際仲裁院以及大灣區內其他持份者，與我們一道積極推廣「港資」措施的應用，我們也十分歡迎各位隨時向律政司反饋意見。

此外，律政司也積極推動建立並落實「灣區標準」，助力灣區建立多元糾紛解決機制。我們正全力爭取在今年年底制定大灣區仲裁員名冊，增強用家的信心。下一步，我們希望與區內法律部門共同推動設立大灣區商事調解及仲裁平台，凝聚區內仲調機構，共同推廣並採用「灣區標準」，促進灣區仲調服務協同發展。

今日的交流會匯聚灣區內業界的領航人物，為大家帶來實務分享，為灣區法治協同注入新動力、新思維。祝願今日交流會圓滿成功。謝謝。"

Operation of the facility is currently under temporary suspension.

Upon detecting fire and smoke from waste at the facility at about 1.45pm today, the contractor immediately notified the Fire Services Department (FSD) and evacuated all staff and users on site. The fire was largely put out at about 2.30pm by firefighters upon arrival. No injuries were reported.

FSD's initial investigation found no suspicious cause of the fire. It is believed that the fire was caused by sparks produced by welding carried out by the contractor. The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has requested the contractor to submit a report on the fire incident within seven days.

The EPD has temporarily suspended operation of the facility to allow the contractor to carry out cleaning and assess the impact of the incident on the facility. During the suspension, affected users may use other transfer stations or directly deliver waste to landfills for disposal. The EPD has notified the industry about the suspension and will maintain close contact with them."
十一月一日起實施電動私家車新牌費,2025-10-29 16:30,2025-10-29 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/29/P2025102800312.htm,"運輸署今日（十月二十九日）提醒市民，電動私家車的新牌照費將於十一月一日（星期六）起實施。新收費架構適用於新登記的電動私家車，而現有電動私家車續領車輛牌照可獲四個月寬限期；合資格傷殘人士車主可獲牌費寬減。

運輸署發言人說：「新牌費架構按電動私家車車輛登記文件和車輛牌照列明的額定功率收取牌費，並適當地調整牌費水平。新牌費一方面維持電動車的吸引力，繼續鼓勵駕駛者轉用電動車以推動環保，另一方面配合科技發展和緊貼其他地區做法。其他汽車類別的牌費架構和水平則維持不變。」

新牌費架構按額定功率分五級遞增，分五個階段在六年間調整。今年十一月一日至二○二七年二月二十八日的電動私家車每年牌費表列如下：

四個月寬限期內續領車輛牌照的特別安排

現有電動私家車車主需注意，如車輛牌照於二○二六年二月二十八日或之前屆滿，而車主在今年十一月一日至明年二月二十八日期間遞交續領申請，會沿用現行牌費架構和水平。

如續領明年三月一日或之後屆滿的牌照，或於今年十一月一日或之後遞交首次發出或重新發出的車輛牌照申請，則須付新牌費。

為合資格傷殘人士提供電動私家車牌費寬減

政府會為擁有電動私家車的合資格傷殘人士提供牌費寬減，以符合社會共融的政策目標。如其名下電動私家車的額定功率不超過75千瓦，則無須付牌費；如超過75千瓦，牌費為其額定功率層級訂明的每年牌費，減去不超過75千瓦的電動私家車應繳的每年牌費。此安排適用於合資格傷殘人士續領於二○二六年三月一日或之後屆滿的車輛牌照，或今年十一月一日或之後遞交首次發出或重新發出的車輛牌照申請。

New licence fee for electric private cars to take effect from November 1,2025-10-29 16:30,2025-10-29 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/29/P2025102800336.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (October 29) reminded members of the public that the new licence fee for electric private cars (e-PCs) will take effect from November 1 (Saturday). The new fee structure will apply to newly registered e-PCs while renewal of vehicle licences (VLs) for existing ones will be granted a four-month grace period. Eligible disabled vehicle owners will be offered licence fee concessions.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""Under the new licence fee structure, licence fees will be charged based on the rated power of e-PCs stated on their vehicle registration documents and VLs, and the fee levels will be suitably adjusted. On the one hand, the new licence fee maintains the attractiveness of electric vehicles (EVs) to continue encouraging drivers to switch to EVs to promote environmental protection, while on the other hand, it aligns with the technological advancements and practices in other regions. The licence fee structure and level for other vehicle classes remain unchanged.""

  The new five-tier licence fee structure based on rated power will comprise incremental adjustments in five phases over six years. The annual licence fee (ALF) for e-PCs from November 1, 2025, to February 28, 2027 is tabulated as follows:




Rated power of e-PCs (kilowatts) (kW)
ALF from November 1, 2025, to February 28, 2027 ($) (Note)


≤75
1,500


>75 to 125
2,000


>125 to 175
2,500


>175 to 225
3,000


>225
5,000


Note:
			
The ALF from March 1, 2027, onwards is set out in the Annex.
The Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Fund Levy is not yet included, i.e. $114 per vehicle for one year and $38 for four months at present.
The fee for a licence for four months is 35 per cent of that for an annual licence, plus an additional fee of $30.






  Under the new licence fee structure, according to the current distribution of licensed e-PCs, the rated power of 99 per cent of them fall within the first, second and third tiers, while the proportions of e-PCs in the fourth and fifth tiers are only 1 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively.

Special arrangements for VL renewal during four-month grace period

  Existing e-PC owners should note that, if their VL expires on or before February 28, 2026, and the renewal application is submitted from November 1, 2025, to February 28, 2026, the prevailing licence fee structure and levels will apply.

  As for renewal of VLs expiring on or after March 1, 2026, or applications for first or re-issue of VLs submitted on or after November 1, 2025, the new licence fees will apply.

Provision of licence fee concession to eligible disabled e-PC owners

  The Government will offer licence fee concession to eligible disabled e-PC owners pursuant to the policy objective of social integration. If the rated power of such e-PC does not exceed 75 kW, no licence fee will be charged. If it exceeds 75 kW, the ALF will be charged by deducting an amount equal to the prescribed ALF for an e-PC with a rated power of no more than 75 kW from the ALF of its rated power tier. This arrangement will apply to eligible disabled persons who renew VLs expiring on or after March 1, 2026, or submit applications for first or re-issue of VLs on or after November 1, 2025.

  The TD has issued letters to the automotive trades and vehicle dealers concerned to remind them to take note of the implementation of the new licence fee structure. Notices have been displayed at the TD's Licensing Offices to introduce the above arrangements. The TD will also put up messages about the new fee structure through the ""Electronic Driving Licence"" mobile app and the e-Licensing Portal (elicensingportal.td.gov.hk/login).

  Members of the public may refer to the TD's websiteor call the hotline at 2804 2600 for details."

響應世界中風關注日　衞生署呼籲加深了解中風徵兆及奉行健康生活,2025-10-29 11:00,2025-10-29 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/29/P2025102800590.htm,"為響應「世界中風關注日」，衞生署今日（十月二十九日）呼籲市民加深了解中風的成因和徵兆，以便及早預防和求醫。政府一直致力以全生命周期的健康促進策略作推廣，包括鼓勵市民在不同年齡和狀況建立健康飲食、多做體能活動、避免煙酒的健康生活模式，以預防包括中風等非傳染病。政府亦透過積極推廣「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」），提供便捷的糖尿病與高血壓篩查服務，以及血脂檢查，實現「三高全覆蓋」。

衞生署衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「中風是全世界導致殘疾和死亡的主因。全球每4名25歲以上的成年人中就有1名會在一生中患上中風，而這情況並不局限於老年人，約60%的中風個案涉及70歲以下人士，更有16%的病人在50歲前中風。中風是香港第四大常見死因，去年共錄得2 911宗（臨時數據）登記死亡個案，當中7.7%為55歲或以下人士。二○二五年世界中風關注日的主題為『分秒必爭』。時間是治療中風的關鍵，大家越早察覺自己或身邊的人出現中風徵兆，越早讓患者接受治療，治療成效就越好。」

市民應謹記中風的症狀警示「談笑用兵」──

「談」是指表達／說話有困難；
「笑」是指面部表情不對稱；
「用」是指一邊手腳無力；及
如出現以上中風警示，便要從速求醫找救「兵」，以挽救生命。


徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，多達八成的中風案例是可以透過健康生活，妥善管理高血壓、高膽固醇、糖尿病和肥胖等風險因素來預防。根據二○二○至二○二二年度人口健康調查發現，分別有41%、36%和70%的高血壓、糖尿病和高膽固醇血症患者並不知道自己的情況，直到經接受調查提供的體檢後才意識到已患病。

為提升市民的疾病預防意識和自我健康管理能力，基層醫療署透過各地區康健中心／地區康健站（統稱為康健中心）和家庭醫生積極推廣「健康人生計劃」。政府在二○二三年推出為期三年的「慢病共治計劃」，資助45歲或以上未曾確診患有高血壓或糖尿病的香港居民，配對家庭醫生並於私營醫療市場接受糖尿病及高血壓篩查。先導計劃今年三月擴展至提供血脂檢查，做到「三高全覆蓋」。經篩查後被診斷為血糖偏高，或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂的參加者可進入治療階段，在政府資助下由自行選擇的家庭醫生繼續診治，以及按健康狀況獲處方藥物，接受專屬護士診所和專職醫療服務。先導計劃強化「一人一家庭醫生」概念，以康健中心為樞紐，擴闊社區醫療網絡。

截至今年十月八日，已有超過16萬名市民參加「慢病共治計劃」，預料能較預期時間提早達致約20萬名市民參加的目標；約99 200人（接近六成）已完成篩查，其中約40 000人（約四成）被診斷為血糖偏高，或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂，並已進入治療階段。市民如欲了解「慢病共治計劃」詳情，可瀏覽「慢病共治計劃」專題網站。

政府會繼續推動市民奉行健康生活，並會與社區夥伴緊密合作，共同建設一個有利人們健康生活的環境。詳情可瀏覽衞生署「活出健康新方向」網頁。"
DH appeals to public to deepen their understanding of stroke symptoms and lead healthy lifestyles in support of World Stroke Day,2025-10-29 11:00,2025-10-29 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/29/P2025102800596.htm,"In support of World Stroke Day, the Department of Health (DH) today (October 29) appealed to members of the public to deepen their understanding of the causes and symptoms of stroke in order to prevent stroke and seek prompt medical attention as appropriate. The Government long been adopting a life-course health promotion strategy to promote health, including encouraging the public of different age groups and health statuses to adopt a healthy lifestyle encompassing healthy eating, being physically active, and refraining from smoking and alcohol consumption to guard against non-communicable diseases including stroke. Through the Chronic Disease Co-Care (CDCC) Pilot Scheme, the Government actively promotes convenient screening services for diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HT), and blood lipid testing to achieve full coverage of the ""three highs"".

  ""Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Globally, one in four adults over the age of 25 will suffer from stroke at some point in their lifetime, and it is not limited to the elderly. Around 60 per cent of strokes occur in individuals under the age of 70, and 16 per cent occur before the age of 50. Stroke is the fourth most common cause of death in Hong Kong, with 2 911 registered deaths (provisional figure) last year. Among them, 7.7 per cent were people aged 55 or below. The theme for World Stroke Day 2025 is 'Every Minute Counts'. Time is critical in treating stroke. The sooner you recognise stroke symptoms in yourself or others, and the sooner the patient receives treatment, the better the outcome,"" said the Controller of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH, Dr Edwin Tsui.

ããMembers of the public should remember the warning signs of stroke and act ""FAST"":

face drooping: asymmetrical facial expressions;
arm weakness: limb weakness on one side of the body;
speech difficulties: difficulties in communicating with others; and
time: call for immediate medical assistance to save lives.


ããDr Tsui reminded the public that up to 80 per cent of strokes can be prevented through adherence to a healthy lifestyle and proper management of risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity. According to the Population Health Survey 2020-22, among those with hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia, 41 per cent, 36 per cent and 70 per cent of the patients respectively were not aware of their conditions until attending the health examination provided under the survey.

The Primary Healthcare Commission promotes the Life Course Preventive Care Plan through the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) and family doctors, enhancing public awareness on self-health management and disease prevention. The Government launched the three-year CDCC Pilot Scheme since 2023, subsidising Hong Kong residents aged 45 and above with no known medical history of DM or HT to pair with family doctors for DM and HT screening services in the private healthcare market. In March this year, the CDCC Pilot Scheme was expanded to cover blood lipid testing, achieving full coverage of the ""three highs"". Participants diagnosed with prediabetes, DM, HT or hyperlipidaemia after screening can proceed to the treatment phase and will be subsidised by the Government to continue their treatment with a family doctor of their choice, and subject to their health conditions, be provided with prescribed medication, a dedicated nurse clinic and allied health services. The CDCC Pilot Scheme reinforces the ""Family Doctor for All"" concept and expands the community healthcare network through the DHCs as resource hubs.

As of October 8 this year, over 160000 citizens have already enrolled in the CDCC Pilot Scheme. It is expected that the target of having around 200 000 participants during the pilot period can be achieved earlier than expected. Approximately 99 200 participants (i.e. about 60 per cent) have completed the screenings and around 40 000 participants (i.e. about 40 per cent) have been diagnosed with prediabetes, DM, HT or dyslipidaemia, and have proceeded to the treatment phase. For more details of the CDCC Pilot Scheme, members of the public may visit the dedicatedwebsiteof the CDCC Pilot Scheme.

The Government will continue to promote healthy living and work closely with community partners to foster a supportive environment conducive to healthy living. For more information, please visit the Change for Healthwebsiteof the DH."

陳茂波早上出席未來投資倡議大會的開幕式，並在「變革者議會：公私營合作的關鍵力量」（Board of Changemakers: Public–Private Powerbrokers）的環節上發言。該環節主要讓來自不同地區的政府和企業負責人分享在地緣政治和科技變革的大背景下，如何通過公私營合作，促進經濟和社會發展、能源轉型，以及人工智能、生物科技等科技產業的發展。

陳茂波在環節中分享了香港在各類公私營合作模式方面的經驗，包括藉「建設－營運－移交」模式及「鐵路加物業發展」模式，為私人市場提供誘因，促進基礎建設的發展。他亦指出，特區政府正加快推進北部都會區的發展，作為未來經濟多元化的引擎、創新科技產業發展的重要載體，並為市民提供更多優質的就業機會。香港正採取更彈性靈活的方式發展北都，多管齊下引進創科等企業，包括以更靈活的方式批撥土地和輸入人才、共同投資等，以加快規劃建設和產業發展的步伐。

FS leads delegation to attend Future Investment Initiative Summit in Saudi Arabia (with photos/video),2025-10-29 09:00,2025-10-29 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/29/P2025102900111.htm,"  The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, who is currently visiting Saudi Arabia, attended the Future Investment Initiative Summit yesterday (October 28, Riyadh time). He spoke at a key thematic discussion session of the Summit and held meetings with senior government officials and business leaders in the region.

  In the morning, Mr Chan attended the opening ceremony of the Summit and spoke at a session titled ""Board of Changemakers: Public–Private Powerbrokers"". The session brought together leaders from governments and businesses around the world to share insights on how public-private partnerships (PPPs) can foster economic and social development, energy transition, and the advancement of technological sectors, such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology, within the broader context of geopolitical and technological transformation.

  Mr Chan shared Hong Kong's experience in promoting various PPP models, including the Build-Operate-Transfer model and the ""Rail-plus-Property"" model, which have incentivised private sector participation in infrastructure development. He noted that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government is expediting the development of the Northern Metropolis as a new engine for economic diversification, a key base for innovation and technology industries, and a source of quality employment opportunities. Hong Kong is adopting a more flexible and proactive approach in developing the Northern Metropolis, including streamlining land allocation, importing talent and co-investment arrangements, with a view to accelerating planning, construction and industry development.

  Mr Chan also cited the establishment of the Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) Limited by the HKSAR Government as another example of PPP. As patient capital, the HKIC supports the landing of companies and ecosystem building through co-investment and other means. It also partners with other funds in the market to channel capital into industries of strategic value, helping enhance Hong Kong's long-term competitiveness and create quality jobs for society.

  Other speakers in the session included the Minister of Investment of Saudi Arabia, H.E. Khalid bin Abdulaziz Al-Falih; the Minister of Planning and Economic Development and Minister of International Cooperation of Egypt, H.E. Dr Rania Al-Mashat; as well as chairpersons and chief executive officers of various multinational corporations.

  Mr Chan also attended other thematic sessions of the Summit, including a keynote speech delivered by the Vice-President of the People's Republic of China, Mr Han Zheng.

  In addition, Mr Chan held bilateral meetings with a number of local political and business leaders, including the Vice Minister of Finance of Saudi Arabia, Mr Abdulmuhsen bin Saad Alkhalaf; the Group Chief Executive Officer of Diriyah Company, Mr Jerry Inzerillo; the Chief Executive Officer of New Murabba Development Company under the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, Mr Michael Dyke; and the Chief Financial Officer of Red Sea Global, Mr Martin Greenslade.

  In the evening, Mr Chan attended a business seminar hosted by China Investment Corporation and delivered a keynote speech. He pointed out that the Middle East has set out an ambitious development vision and possesses strong growth momentum. At the same time, China is pursuing high-quality development, including a high-level two-way opening-up. There is vast room for collaboration between the two regions in areas such as capital, technology and industrial connectivity.

  Mr Chan said that Hong Kong, as the world's freest economy, enjoys distinctive advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle. These include the common law system, free flow of capital, goods and information, a simple and low tax regime, and a linked exchange rate system between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. As the world's No. 3 international financial centre, Hong Kong is not only an international fundraising and professional services platform for Mainland enterprises going global, but also an ideal gateway for Middle Eastern businesses to access the Mainland market. He noted that around 300 Mainland enterprises are in the pipeline for listing in Hong Kong, many of which plan to expand into the Middle East.

  Mr Chan also highlighted Hong Kong's leading position in offshore Renminbi (RMB) business, asset and wealth management, as well as the family office sector. Hong Kong is the world's largest offshore RMB hub. With increasing trade between China and Saudi Arabia settled in local currencies, the demand for RMB-denominated assets and risk management products is expected to grow. Hong Kong is also Asia's premier centre for asset and wealth management, with assets under management exceeding US$4.5 trillion and a vibrant ecosystem for family offices. He extended a sincere invitation to more enterprises and institutions from Saudi Arabia and the wider Middle East to leverage Hong Kong's platform, and join hands to open a new chapter in cooperation between Asia and the Middle East.

  Mr Chan will continue his visit to Saudi Arabia today (October 29, Riyadh time)."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-28 21:03,2025-10-28 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800758.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 28), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
-----------------------------

Regarding the confirmed CF case involving a 55-year-old female with source of infection yet to be confirmed, the genome analysis is still under way.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 50 confirmed CF cases. Excluding the abovementioned case, there are one local case and 48 imported cases.

In addition, from October 26 to 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessment for about 2 100 residents through the health consultation booth at 2/F, Fung Tak Shopping Centre and inquiry hotline. Among them, 21 individuals were found to have mild symptoms and they have been arranged to undergo blood tests. Laboratory testing is continuing, so far those samples that have completed testing are all negative for chikungunya virus.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 868 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (October 19 to 25), showing a decrease compared to the previous week (October 12 to 18), which reported 2 086 cases. Most of the cases (199 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen last week, followed by Foshan (130 cases), Guangzhou (124 cases) and Shenzhen (102 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

Government's continuous comprehensive actions on prevention and control of CF
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CHP continued to implement various prevention and control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

The CHP officers and District Services & Community Care Teams (Care Teams) have distributed questionnaires and promotional leaflets to about 8 000 households in the district, and will continue to contact the residents, disseminate information, and understand and follow up their health conditions. The CHP has also issued letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and remaining them to be vigilant.

In addition, the CHP has set up an inquiry hotline (2125 2373) and the abovementioned health consultation booth. The hotline and health consultation booth will continue to operate from 9am to 8pm daily to provide assessment to residents with relevant symptoms and answer enquiries relating to CF.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year and it has been continued. Among which, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, these measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


ããThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.
ã
The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as two severe paediatric influenza infection cases recorded in a single day,2025-10-28 20:51,2025-10-28 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800744.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 28) recorded two severe paediatric influenza infection cases. Both had underlying illnesses. The CHP reiterated its appeal to urged schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The first case involves an 11-year-old boy. He has developed a fever, cough and shortness of breath since October 25. He attended the Accident and Emergency Departement (AED) of Princess Margaret Hospital on the following day (October 26) and was admitted for treatment. Today, he was transferred to the hospital's paediatric intensive care unit today due to hypotension. He is currently in serious condition. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with shock.

A recent outbreak of influenza-like illness was recorded in the school dormitory where the boy lives. Three other residents of the dormitory and two staff members recently developed respiratory symptoms. One resident, who required hospitalisation, had a nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A virus. This resident was subsequently discharged after recovering. The symptoms of the other four patients are mild and hospitalisation was not required. The CHP has provided the dormitory with infection control advice, and will administer chemoprophylaxis to its residents and staff.

Another case involves a 11-month-old boy. He has been admitted to Kwong Wah Hospital due to his own underlying disease.He has developed a fever and cough since yesterday (October 27). He was transferred to paediatric intensive care unit of the hospital. He is currently in critical condition. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with severe pneumonia. One of his household contacts developed respiratory symptoms recently, and subsequently recovered.

Neither patient had travel history recently, nor had they received the 2025/26 SIV.

Including the abovementioned two cases, there have been 16 severe paediatric influenza cases since the start of the school year in September, including one fatal case. The affected children aged 11 months to 17 years, with 11 having good past health.ãã

""Hong Kong is currently in the summer influenza season and there has been a significant increase in influenza-like illness outbreaks in schools since September. As of October 27, a total of 677 outbreaks have been reported in schools since the start of the school year in September, including 71 cases in kindergartens/child care centres, 369 cases in primary schools and 237 cases in secondary schools. Based on the current level of influenza activity and trend analysis, the local influenza activity is expected to remain at a relatively high level over the next few weeks. Furthermore, viruses tend to become more active when temperatures drop. The winter influenza season in Hong Kong typically occurs between January and March. The current summer influenza season may overlap with the upcoming winter influenza season, which could lead to more hospitalisations due to influenza infection than in previous years. I urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV, to act promptly, particularly those high-risk groups such as the elderly, children, and adults with underlying illnesses and immunosuppression. Members of the public may also contact their family doctors to arrange for vaccinations,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

Dr Tsui reminded high-risk individuals to wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

""Members of the public, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if presented with fever and respiratory symptoms, for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an AED immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions,"" Dr Tsui said.

In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."

Hong Kong Customs detects two dangerous drugs cases and seizes suspected cocaine and suspected ketamine at airport (with photo),2025-10-28 20:31,2025-10-28 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800743.htm,"âHong Kong Customs detected two drug trafficking cases involving baggage concealment at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (October 27) and seized a total of about four kilograms of suspected cocaine and about 12kg of suspected ketamine, with a total estimated market value of about $7.9 million. Two persons suspected to be connected with the cases were arrested.

In the first case, a 26-year-old male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Paris, France, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found a batch of suspected cocaine, weighing about 4kg with an estimated market value of about $2.4 million, concealed in the false compartment of his check-in suitcase. The man was subsequently arrested.

In the second case, a 50-year-old female passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Paris, France, via Doha, Qatar, on the same day. During customs clearance, Customs officers found a batch of suspected ketamine, weighing about 12kg with an estimated market value of about $5.5 million, in her check-in suitcase. The woman was subsequently arrested.

For the first case, an investigation is still ongoing. The arrested woman in the second case has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, and she will appear at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on October 30.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
​保安局局長出席撲滅罪行委員會會議後會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-10-28 20:17,2025-10-28 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800721.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（十月二十八日）出席撲滅罪行委員會會議後，在添馬政府總部會見傳媒的談話內容：

各位香港市民、各位記者朋友，大家好。

今日，我會跟大家談談二○二五年一月至九月，即首三季的香港整體治安情況。

在二○二五年首三季，香港整體罪案有66585宗，與去年、即二○二四年同期比較下跌4.9%。繼上季度下跌4.2%之後，再持續進一步回落。破案率為26.3%，與去年同期相若。

​暴力罪案有6559宗，下跌16.4%。大部分罪案數字均錄得下跌，特別是傳統罪案，例如行劫、爆竊、傷人及嚴重毆打和盜竊案等，下跌百分比由8.6%至40.5%不等，部分更再創歷史新低，包括爆竊、行劫和傷人及嚴重毆打案件。至於詐騙案，就與去年同期相若。

而錄得主要升幅的罪案只有嚴重毒品案，有935宗，比去年同期上升9.6%。其中大約三分一涉及依托咪酯，而升幅亦主要由涉及依托咪酯有關的製毒和販毒案件所帶動。

涉及依托咪酯案件方面，今年首三季有749宗，拘捕919人，與去年同期比較分別上升九倍和七倍；檢獲數量亦由去年首三季的大約五萬粒煙彈，升至今年同期的大約28萬粒煙彈，升幅超過五倍。這除了反映吸食依托咪酯的嚴重性外，亦反映了我們執法的成效。我們會繼續密切留意有關情況，採取針對性的措施，嚴厲打擊與依托咪酯相關的罪案。

至於詐騙案方面，今年一月至九月詐騙案錄得32142宗，與去年同期相若。涉及騙款56.4億元，則較去年同期下跌12%，而詐騙案仍佔整體罪案數字的大約48%。網上騙案佔整體詐騙案67%，錄得21256宗，與去年同期相比上升6.9%。網上騙案上升主要由網上購物騙案和網上求職騙案的上升所帶動。網上求職騙案當中，九成六仍然使用「刷單回佣」這個騙案手法。即騙徒利用「落單員」這些低門檻、高佣金的職位，欺騙受害人轉賬至充值平台，然後進行點讚或買賣貨物等「任務」去賺取佣金，但當受害人投資了一定程度的金額之後，騙徒就會挾帶私逃。

至於整體反詐騙工作，除了與銀行和電訊業界繼續緊密合作之外：

（一）在針對學生方面，特別是新來港學生，警方推出新版的「網上學習套件」，涵蓋各類常見騙案手法和防騙資訊。全港多間大專院校已經規定學生在使用圖書館或其他設施之前，必須完成課程，以應對新學年這類型騙案的高峰期。

（二）在針對長者方面，警方聯同衞生署透過社福機構和關愛隊等，向長者派發防騙資訊包，並由耆樂警訊推出「耆樂科技隊長」訓練，教導長者使用「防騙視伏APP」和識別最新犯案手法，提供簡單易明的防騙指引。

（三）針對虛擬資產相關罪案方面，警方成立了「虛擬資產情報工作組」，聯同金管局、證監會、持牌虛擬資產服務提供者等，透過情報交流和聯合行動，打擊詐騙和堵截贓款。

（五）最後在執法方面，針對持續演變的網絡威脅，警方在今年首三季推行「淨網行動」，與國際刑警和各地執法部門合作，封鎖或下架超過兩萬個惡意網站，並在海外拘捕32名疑犯。

另外，我想談談政府在打撃黑工，即非法勞工方面的工作。

黑工問題不單影響本地工人的就業機會，若處理不當，更可能對香港經濟發展帶來長遠影響。為進一步加大力度打擊黑工，我們在九月成立了跨部門反黑工專責組，以加強協調不同部門在制訂策略、強化情報搜集、嚴厲執法和協調宣傳以及教育的工作，多管齊下。反黑工專責組成立後，入境處（入境事務處）已經即時推出舉報非法勞工專線3861 5000。專線推出至今大約一個多月，入境處已經收到超過350個相關舉報。至於執法方面，自專責組成立以來，入境處聯同其他部門一共進行超過2 000次打擊黑工行動，拘捕130名黑工和46名僱主或協助以及教唆人士。

另外，我想談談個別重點行業範疇。今年至今（十月二十六日）執法部門已採取多次針對性的行動：

（一）包括針對外賣平台，拘捕了30名黑工，24名僱主或者協助以及教唆人士。

（二）針對經內地社交媒體宣傳，聲稱可以來香港提供化妝、裝修、攝影等不同服務的黑工，入境處透過網上巡邏和「放蛇」行動，拘捕了24名黑工和3名僱主或協助以及教唆人士。拘捕的黑工涉及提供代購、化妝或攝影等服務。

專責組會繼續密切留意黑工的情況，並適時制訂應對策略，和透過執法行動以打擊相關的非法活動。

最後，香港將會有兩項體育盛事，包括十一月九日開始的第十五屆全國運動會和十二月八日開始的全國第十二屆殘特奧會（全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會），相關紀律部隊已作好全面準備，確保賽事安全有序進行，亦希望市民可以參與和觀賞比賽，享受氣氛。

另外，十二月七日是立法會換屆選舉的大日子，大家記得當日與家人和朋友一同投票，履行公民責任，選出愛國愛港的有能之士，同創美好未來。多謝大家。

記者：局長，你好。首先想問關於選舉方面，我們見到特首今早批評有人抹黑選舉，或者作出一些干預。想了解一下政府有沒有調查到這些事情是否涉及犯法？如果違法，剛才特首說有的話就會依法打擊，那會依甚麼法去打擊？另外想問一個數字，就是「忘我」類檢獲的毒品，今年差不多有43 000粒，當中有否依托咪酯？升幅上升了差不多600%。其實在打擊這些毒品上的工作是否要再加強？怎樣去加強？

保安局局長：多謝你的問題。首先，立法會是「愛國者治港」其中一個重要成分。我們所有市民都必須盡公民責任，投票選出一些愛國愛港和有才能的人，為香港服務。我亦留意到社會上有些死心不息、不想香港好、想危害香港和國家安全的人，在煽動、挑撥、抹黑這次選舉。我想在此警告和提醒各位，如果你是勸人不要投票，又或者投白票的話，這可能是違法行為；如果你是勾結外國勢力，從而操縱或影響選舉，這是違法行為；如果你有任何煽動意圖，這可能是違法行為。所有執法部門，對於任何違法行為，都會採取果斷的執法行動。我們亦會從情報搜集着手，確保這次選舉能在安全、有序的情況下，讓市民選出愛國愛港的人士。

另外，剛才你提到「忘我」類毒品檢獲的粒數上升了，由去年同期的六千多粒到今年大約四萬多粒。其實這增幅最主要是由香港警方和馬來西亞警方一個以情報為本的聯合行動所檢獲到這些「忘我」類毒品。根據情報顯示，這些毒品並非以香港為目的地，而是轉運到其他（地方）。所以，這次成功的執法行動，其實堵截了這些「忘我」類毒品經香港運到其他地方。「忘我」類毒品本身是一種毒品，與依托咪酯是兩類毒品。

記者：局長，你好。我想問，剛剛說到今早特首也有提到，好像有些人在背後抹黑選舉。過往的選舉也有一些個案，就是有人可能呼籲他人投白票。其實你剛剛說的情報搜集工作或者執法行動，是不是現在已經開展了？會不會做一些網上巡邏，看看有沒有人有煽動？甚至你剛剛提到的勾結外國勢力的行為？巡查的工作是不是現在已經開始？或者甚麼時候會開始？警方會不會這樣做？另外想問，關於內地黑工方面，看到這次內地非法入境者的被捕人數其實都升了五成。其實這五成當中，有多少是黑工的人數？有沒有其他跡象顯示黑工的情況是越來越多？有多少是牽涉內地？政府除了專責小組，有沒有其他方法打擊？

保安局局長：首先，針對任何想危害選舉安全的違法行為，我們都會採取所有執法行動，包括情報搜集行動。情報搜集行動是不會間斷的，一直會繼續的；之前已經開始，不會完結的。你不要以為在網上做一些違法行為就會追查不到你，在網上做違法行為和在實體上做違法行為都是一樣，只要你違法，我們就有辦法找到證據，能夠找到你是誰，然後將你拘捕和作出檢控。

另外，有關黑工的數字，其實現時我們整體的黑工（人數），佔一半是由內地來的，另一半並非由內地來的，是其他地方來的。

記者：局長，想問黑工方面，其實我們現在看到有些個案是有一些黑工的操作方法，就是先用旅客身分進入香港，然後再從事黑工活動。保安局或者一些政府部門是用甚麼方法來堵塞這個漏洞？

保安局局長：我們留意到有些黑工用旅客身分從事黑工的工作。針對這個情況，其實我們採取了多方面的行動。首先，很多時這些黑工都是先透過一些社交媒體在香港找一些客人，然後過來。例如我剛才提到的一些是涉及裝修工程，可能一些是涉及拍照和攝影。我們從源頭開始做網上巡邏，然後進行一些「放蛇」行動，接着作出拘捕。我們不單會進行拘捕行動，我們跟內地相關單位已經有聯絡，第一是希望這些涉及非法行為的廣告能夠下架。第二方面也是希望在源頭方面與內地採取相應行動。另外，我們也在香港針對不同類型的黑工活動。例如，針對外賣平台，我們其實已經跟這些平台進行情報搜集和聯合行動，以打擊黑工利用外賣平台從事違法行動；又例如在一些裝修的地點或者地盤，我們有情報顯示可能會有黑工工作的地方，我們都會由入境處（入境事務處）聯同其他部門採取執法行動，去打擊黑工活動。

記者：局長，你好。想問詐騙方面，因為見今年詐騙的數字跟去年差不多，其實今年警方、保安局都做了很多反詐宣傳，怎樣評估成效？跟去年的數字差不多。還有見到網上罪案方面其實是上升了少許，其實這方面的工作，如何評估網上罪案為何會上升？有沒有甚麼原因？最後就是問今早特首所說，其實保安局是不是已經見到有一些跡象，又或者有證據顯示有人在背後抹黑選舉的行為？可不可以透露一下？

保安局局長：首先我想談談網上騙案。其實大家可以理解，網上騙案在二○二三年上升差不多超過40%，二○二四較二○二三年上升大約11%，今年的數字則相若。其實你看到，相比以往的情況，已經一直改善中。但是，關於打擊騙案的工作，我們必須不單從執法做起，也要從預防方面做起。因為騙徒的手法日新月異，今天用這個手法，明天用另一個手法，所以我們要確保歹徒不能得逞，我們就要針對他最想騙的人。例如，我們留意到近期是針對學生，包括一些內地來的學生，又或者一些長者，或者針對叫他們「刷單」買物品的，又或者針對網上情緣。在不同的情況下，我們都要針對這些不停在變的手法，採取不同的措施打擊這些罪案。總之，一日還有騙案，我們都會繼續採取措施打擊。

第二，剛才你提到有關危害選舉的問題。我們不會容許有任何罪犯可以有機會搞亂這次選舉，因為全體香港市民都很希望可以透過這次公平的選舉，選出愛國愛港、有能力的人為我們香港服務，所以我們必須對想擾亂這次選舉的行為作出適當的行動。多謝大家。"
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-28 20:00,2025-10-28 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800722.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月二十八日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————

就昨日確診基孔肯雅熱但感染源頭有待確定的55歲女子，病毒基因分析工作仍在進行。

本港今年累計錄得50宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案。撇除上述個案，一宗屬本地個案，48宗屬輸入個案。

此外，由前日至今日下午五時，中心已透過設於鳳德商場二樓的醫護站及熱線電話為約2 100名居民作評估，當中發現21名出現輕微病徵的市民，中心已安排他們接受抽血檢查，化驗工作正陸續進行，暫時已完成檢驗的樣本全部對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（十月十九日至二十五日）廣東省新增868宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較對上一周（十月十二日至十八日）的2 086宗顯著下降。上周大部分個案（199宗）在江門巿錄得，其次為佛山（130宗）、廣州（124宗）及深圳（102宗）。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

政府繼續全方位防控基孔肯雅熱
——————————————

中心正繼續聯同政府多個部門和相關機構採取適當防控措施，全力預防基孔肯雅熱在本地扎根和減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

中心人員和當區關愛隊已向當區約八千戶民居派發問卷及宣傳單張，並會繼續聯絡居民發放資訊，了解及跟進他們的健康情況。中心亦已發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺。

另外，中心由十月二十六日起設立熱線（電話：2125 2373）及上述的醫護站，每日由上午九時至下午八時運作，為出現相關症狀的居民作評估和解答市民有關基孔肯雅熱的查詢。

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
單日錄得兩宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-10-28 19:45,2025-10-28 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800706.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月二十八日）接獲兩宗有長期病患的兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案，遂再次敦促學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

首宗個案涉及一名11歲男童。他在十月二十五日開始出現發燒、咳嗽和氣促，翌日（十月二十六日）到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫，需留院治理，今日因血壓過低被轉往該院的兒童深切治療部，目前情況嚴重。他的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發休克。

男童居住的學校宿舍近日曾出現流感樣爆發，除上述個案外，另外三名宿生及兩名員工近日出現呼吸道病徵，其中一人需留院治理，其鼻咽拭子樣本同樣證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，目前已康復出院。另外四人情況輕微，無需入院。中心已向該學校宿舍提供感染控制建議，並會向該宿舍宿生及員工提供抗病毒預防藥物。

第二宗個案涉及一名11個月大男嬰。他因自身疾病在廣華醫院留醫，昨日（十月二十七日）開始出現發燒和咳嗽，被轉送該院的兒童深切治療部，目前情況危殆。他的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型（H3）流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發嚴重肺炎。他的一名家居接觸者近期亦曾出現呼吸道病徵，現已康復。

兩名患者最近均不曾外遊，亦尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗。

計及上述兩宗個案，由九月開學至今，有16宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，當中包括一宗死亡個案，年齡介乎11個月大至17歲，其中11人過往的健康狀況良好。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港正值夏季流感季節，學校的流感樣疾病爆發個案自九月起大幅上升。截至十月二十七日，九月開學後涉及學校的爆發個案共有677宗，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（71宗）、小學（369宗）及中學（237宗）。按目前流感活躍程度和趨勢分析，流感活躍程度在未來幾星期預計會維持在較高水平。另一方面，氣溫下降，病毒一般會較活躍。香港的冬季流感季節大多在一月至三月期間出現，今次夏季流感季節有可能與下一個冬季流感重疊，導致因感染流感而住院的人數較以往更多。我呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動，特別是高風險群組，例如長者、兒童，及患有慢性疾病和免疫抑制的成年人。市民亦可以聯絡自己家庭醫生安排接種。」

他提醒高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

徐樂堅醫生說：「如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。」

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

HKSAR Government's response to 2025 World Justice Project Rule of Law Index,2025-10-28 19:03,2025-10-28 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800668.htm,"âThe World Justice Project released the Rule of Law Index 2025 today (October 28). Hong Kong's ranking in the Index continues to be 6th in East Asia and the Pacific, and 24th out of 143 countries and jurisdictions globally. Hong Kong’s overall score (0.72) remains unchanged and is the same as the countries ranked 22nd and 23rd globally. The scores in most of the aspects have only been slightly adjusted. Hong Kong remains high in the overall ranking and continues to be ahead of some European and American countries which often unreasonably criticise the rule of law and human rights situation of Hong Kong.

Hong Kong continues to maintain its position within the top 10 globally in respect of ""Absence of Corruption"" and ""Order and Security"". Both the global rankings in relation to ""Absence of Corruption"" and ""Regulatory Enforcement"" are higher than last year, ranking 9th and 15th respectively. This shows that, in addition to its comprehensive regulatory enforcement mechanism, Hong Kong remains one of the most corruption-free places in the world and that the effectiveness of its anti-corruption efforts has been recognised internationally. This also demonstrates that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been fully committed to combating acts and activities which endanger national security in accordance with the law after the full implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance and other relevant laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, restoring order in the community and ensuring steady economic development and Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability effectively. The continuous improvement in these areas is conducive to the construction of rule of law and positive business environment, consolidating and enhancing Hong Kong's unique advantages, and allowing it to fully play its role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" through its connectivity with both the Mainland and the world.

Hong Kong’s rankings in respect of ""Criminal Justice"", ""Civil Justice"" and ""Constraints on Government Powers"" remain almost unchanged. The judicial system in Hong Kong is protected by the Basic Law. All prosecutorial decisions are based on an objective analysis of all admissible evidence and applicable laws, free from any interference. The legal framework in Hong Kong aligns with international standards and keeps up with the times, fully safeguarding the rights of all parties. The Judiciary exercises judicial power independently in accordance with the law, and anyone charged with a criminal offence or involved in civil and commercial cases has the right to a fair hearing.

Hong Kong's scores and global rankings slightly drop in the aspects of ""Open Government"" and ""Fundamental Rights"". However, Hong Kong's rankings in these areas in East Asia and the Pacific remain unchanged. The minor drop in the rankings does not seem to fully reflect the real situation in Hong Kong. The HKSAR Government will continue to strengthen its explanatory work through various channels. Indeed, Hong Kong has a robust legal framework for the protection of human rights and an open judicial system. The HKSAR Government steadfastly safeguards the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people as protected under the law. Hong Kong residents can seek justice through legal means and are protected by a solid legal aid system under the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.

Under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong is the only bilingual common law jurisdiction in the world using Chinese and English. Its legal system is fair and well-established, highly aligned with international standards, and home to a deep pool of legal professionals with extensive international experience. The construction of rule of law in Hong Kong remains robust and stable, and Hong Kong's high standard of justice has been widely recognised and respected by the international community. The HKSAR Government will continue to steadfastly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, fully and faithfully live up to the principle of ""one country, two systems"", and promote the rule of law education to comprehensively uphold the rule of law in the HKSAR. The HKSAR Government will also enhance its explanatory efforts through various channels, including inviting overseas people to engage in international events in Hong Kong, such as international legal forums, enabling them to experience and understand Hong Kong's actual situation first hand."
Director of Health inspects arrangements for Seasonal Influenza Vaccination School Outreach and urges schools to advance vaccination activities as much as possible (with photos),2025-10-28 19:02,2025-10-28 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800634.htm,"The Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, visited Kiangsu & Chekiang Primary School (International Section) in North Point this morning (October 28) to inspect the arrangements for the Seasonal Influenza Vaccination (SIV) School Outreach. He also urged schools to complete their vaccination activities as early as possible to provide convenience for parents. Working together to boost the vaccination rates can help reduce the risk of serious illness and death from seasonal influenza among children.

""From what I observed on-site, the vaccination process proceeded very smoothly for students, regardless of whether they chose the injectable inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) or the live attenuated influenza vaccines (i.e. nasal LAIV). This is attributable to the thoughtful arrangements and thorough preparation by the outreach team and the school administration in advance. To encourage schoolchildren to receive the SIV, the Department of Health (DH) has introduced enhancement measures this year. All schools may opt for the nasal LAIV and the 'hybrid mode', which allows schools to choose both the IIV and the nasal LAIV during the same or different outreach vaccination activities,"" Dr Lam said.

""To boost SIV rates, enrolment for the SIV School Outreach Programme has started since the beginning of June this year, which was earlier than last year. With the concerted efforts of the Government and various community sectors (including the medical sector and schools), approximately 2 300 schools (99 per cent) are going to arrange SIV school outreach activities. Since the start of the school year, about 980 schools have held SIV school outreach activities, which is higher than the approximately 800 schools during the same period last season. Moreover, around 2 190 schools (95 per cent) have scheduled to carry this out by the end of next month (November), which is higher than last year's 83 per cent. All in all, this season's school outreach activities will generally be completed earlier than last season. Twenty-three schools have earlier responded to the Centre for Health Protection (CHP)'s call to advance their outreach activities, originally scheduled for December this year or January next year, to be held by the end of next month. In view of the possibility of the overlap of summer and winter influenza seasons, I urge the schools originally scheduled to carry out vaccination activities in December this year to advance vaccination activities as much as possible. Should schools encounter any difficulties in advancing their outreach activities, they may contact the CHP during office hours at 3975 4872 and the CHP will provide full assistance,"" he added.

The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, accompanied Dr Lam during the visit. ""Based on past experience, school outreach can significantly increase the SIV vaccination rate among schoolchildren by more than double. Only through the concerted efforts of the Government, schools and parents to increase vaccination coverage can we effectively strengthen the immune barrier for schoolchildren. Hong Kong is currently in the summer influenza season and there has been a significant increase in influenza-like illness outbreaks in schools since September. As of October 27, a total of 677 outbreaks have been reported in schools since the start of the school year in September, including 71 cases in kindergartens/child care centres, 369 cases in primary schools and 237 cases in secondary schools. Since the start of the school year, 14 severe paediatric influenza cases, including one fatal case, involving children aged 2 to 17 have been recorded. Among them, 11 had good past health. Based on the current level of influenza activity and trend analysis, the local influenza activity is expected to remain at a relatively high level over the next few weeks. Furthermore, viruses tend to become more active when temperatures drop. The winter influenza season in Hong Kong typically occurs between January and March. The current summer influenza season may overlap with the upcoming winter influenza season, which could lead to more hospitalisations due to influenza infection than in previous years,"" he said.

All persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, are recommended to receive the SIV for personal and family protection.The Government has opened all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged 6 months to under 2 years to receive vaccine. Moreover, the District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission in the 18 districts, and 74 Family Medicine Clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For the list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP'sVaccination Schemespage. Parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccinations at designated MCHCs via theonline booking system.

""Since the SIV programmes' launch, over 1 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccines have been administered under various SIV programmes, representing an approximately 5.4 per cent increase compared to the same period last year. However, the coverage rate among children aged 6 months to under 2 years remains relatively low at about 10 per cent only. We hope all sectors of the society could join hands in appealing parents to arrange SIV for their children, while also educating parents on the importance of vaccination. This will promote a greater vaccine uptake among children, increased vaccination coverage rate and strengthen protection for children,"" Dr Lam said.

20th Eco Expo Asia opens today (with photos),2025-10-28 18:38,2025-10-28 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102700424.htm,"The 20th Eco Expo Asia is being held at AsiaWorld-Expo from today (October 28) to October 31.

律政司副司長在第四屆全球海洋中心城市建設法治論壇暨粵港澳大灣區海洋法治論壇致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-28 18:33,2025-10-28 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/28/P2025102800647.htm,"以下是律政司副司長張國鈞博士今日（十月二十八日）在第四屆全球海洋中心城市建設法治論壇暨粵港澳大灣區海洋法治論壇的視像致辭：

成副局長（深圳市海洋發展局副局長成嶂旻）、劉院長（深圳國際仲裁院院長劉曉春博士）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家下午好。感謝深圳國際仲裁院的邀請，讓我有機會在本次論壇上作開幕致辭。非常遺憾今日未能親自到場與在座各位交流，但十分高興可以透過視頻方式參與其中。

今日的論壇匯聚中國境內外海事與法律領域的專家，共同探討中國海事爭議解決的熱點議題。香港憑藉作為國際法律及爭議解決服務中心及國際航運中心的策略性地位，能以其優質高效及值得信賴的海事爭議解決服務，為內地出海企業保駕護航。

仲裁是國際航運海商界解決爭議的主要方式。香港一直是國際仲裁首選地點之一。根據倫敦大學瑪麗皇后學院二○二五年的國際仲裁調查，香港與另一地區並列全球第二最受歡迎仲裁地，更同時獲選為亞太區首選仲裁地。香港在《波羅的海國際航運公會法律及仲裁條款2020》中也被納入為四個指定仲裁地之一，充分印證香港在海事仲裁領域的領先地位。

去年，香港國際仲裁中心受理的仲裁案件總數達352宗，當中海事海商爭議更成為首十位的爭議類型，佔所有仲裁案件的百分之十二。

作為全球唯一擁有中英雙語普通法體系的司法管轄區，香港的《仲裁條例》以聯合國國際貿易法委員會《國際商事仲裁示範法》作為藍本，為國際商界所熟悉。

香港自回歸祖國以來與內地訂立多項與仲裁有關的司法互助安排。當中，二○一九年簽署的《關於內地與香港特別行政區法院就仲裁程序相互協助保全的安排》（《保全安排》）令香港成為內地以外首個及現時唯一一個普通法司法管轄區，在作為仲裁地，由指定仲裁機構管理的仲裁程序的當事人可以向內地法院申請保全措施。不得不提，香港仲裁個案當事人在《保全安排》下首次向內地法院提出保全申請的是一宗海事糾紛。

在這樣的背景下，「港資港法」與「港資港仲裁」措施的擴展，為粵港澳大灣區內海洋產業企業提供了更多選擇，更靈活、更國際化的法律保障。

對海洋產業而言，這些措施具有重要意義。海工（海洋工程）企業、航運公司和海洋裝備製造商在開展跨境業務時，常面臨複雜的技術與合同爭議。如今，它們可透過在適用城市設立符合資格的港資企業，在合同中約定適用與國際商業慣例接軌的香港普通法，並選擇香港作為仲裁地。這不僅提升了法律適用的可預期性，更可透過香港成熟的仲裁制度，處理涉及高價值船舶、海工設備等類型的爭議。

事實上，相關機制已經積累了寶貴的實踐經驗。今年六月，華南（香港）國際仲裁院成功處理了一宗涉及深圳港資企業的仲裁案件，爭議金額超過六千萬人民幣。這一案例不但充分證明措施的擴展廣受企業歡迎，而且突顯香港作為仲裁地完全具備穩健成熟的制度，為仲裁機構處理大額爭議提供足夠制度支撐。

律政司多年以來一直與業界保持緊密交流與合作，並積極向內地企業推廣香港的法律和爭議解決服務，鼓勵企業選用香港為仲裁地。我們期待兩地仲裁機構繼續善用香港獨特的制度優勢，為更多海工和海洋企業提供專業高效的爭議解決服務，助力涉海企業在全球市場中乘風破浪、穩健前行。

最後，祝願本次論壇成為知識交流與合作共贏的盛會，為海洋事業的可持續發展注入新動能，祝願論壇圓滿成功。謝謝大家。"

Eleven energetic drummers in vibrant costumes push their physical limits, embodying the resilience of the phoenix. Their resounding drumbeats harmonise with the melodies of the shamisen, koto and shinobue, sure to stir the hearts of audience members.

 Known for its explosive drumbeats, passionate performances, and meticulously crafted stage and lighting designs, YAMATO has captivated countless fans since its inception in 1993 in Nara, Japan. As a global ambassador of Japanese culture, the ensemble has delivered over 5 000 performances in 55 countries and regions to nearly 8 million spectators.
