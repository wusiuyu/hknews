Justice upheld in Court of First Instance's sentence regarding Lai Chee-ying case,2026-02-09 15:03,2026-02-09 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900400.htm,"The Court of First Instance of the High Court today (February 9) handed down sentences for Lai Chee-ying and the other eight defendants, as well as three companies relating to Apple Daily in respect of their convictions of a total of three charges of offences endangering national security. The total sentence for Lai Chee-ying was imprisonment for 20 years. As for the other eight defendants, their imprisonment terms ranged from six years and three months to 10 years. The three companies relating to Apple Daily were each sentenced to a fine of HK$3,004,500.

The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, said, ""Lai Chee-ying has committed numerous heinous crimes, and his evil deeds were beyond measure. The severe sentence of 20 years' imprisonment imposed on him manifests that the rule of law is upheld and justice is done, and also brings great relief to all. Lai Chee-ying had long used Apple Daily to poison the minds of our citizens, by inciting hatred, distorting facts, deliberately stirring up social antagonism and glorifying violence. He had openly begged for external forces to impose sanctions against China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), sacrificing the well-being of the people of China and the HKSAR. He betrayed our country and harmed Hong Kong, causing damage to the interests of our country and the HKSAR. His conviction is supported by overwhelming evidence, and he for sure deserves his punishment after all the harm he has done.

  ""Lai Chee-ying's malicious acts endangering national security have harmed the interests of our country and the HKSAR, as well as the interests of our citizens. The court, after 156 days of fair and impartial public hearings and having considered the irrefutable evidence of up to 2 220 exhibits, over 80 000 pages of documents and statements of evidence from 14 prosecution witnesses, concluded that Lai Chee-ying was the mastermind behind those anti-China and destabilising activities. His acts are despicable and shameless.

  ""The conviction of the heinous crimes committed by Lai Chee-ying was the first convicted case of the offence of 'collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security' since the promulgation and implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL). This marks an important milestone in the HKSAR's efforts to safeguard national security, manifesting the role of the HKNSL as a key stabilising force. This case also admonishes that villains who endanger national security could never escape the sanctions of the law and would surely be severely punished in accordance with the law. The HKSAR will continue to steadfastly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.

  ""The court has already handed down severe sentences for Lai Chee-ying and the other defendants in accordance with the law, manifesting that the rule of law is upheld and justice is done. That said, Hong Kong as a whole has already paid a heavy price. Poisoned by Lai Chee-ying, and Apple Daily under his control, some of our citizens, especially young people, have been misled to break the law and become radical and violent. During the period of 'blackclad violence', they committed acts of vandalism on public facilities. Not only did they storm the Legislative Council and government buildings, throw petrol bombs, and commit arson, but some even set people on fire. Furthermore, some young people smuggled real guns, made bombs, and plotted terrorist activities. It was fortunate that the Police had taken prompt enforcement actions to crack down on these plots, thus preventing mass casualties. However, many young people who had been incited to commit those crimes eventually ended up in prison. In fact, as of the end of last year, more than 2 400 individuals have been held accountable for unlawful acts during the period of 'black-clad violence'. It is plain to see that the evil deeds committed by Lai Chee-ying and his syndicate were beyond measure.""

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""The court pointed out clearly in its verdict handed down earlier that Lai Chee-ying was the mastermind of the case. He had manipulated and exploited Apple Daily to poison society, and repeatedly colluded with external forces to beg for sanctions and hostile activities against the Central Authorities and the HKSAR Government. Lai Chee-ying's malicious plot spanned across both the periods before and after the promulgation of the HKNSL. His intent was to collude with external forces to harm the interests of China and the HKSAR, as well as those of our citizens. He also shamelessly acted as a pawn of external forces to endanger national security.

  ""After hearing the submissions of the defendants on sentencing in the hearings of January 12 and 13, the court provided a detailed account of its considerations in every respect in its reasons for the sentence handed down today. The court held that the offence of 'conspiracy to print, publish, sell, offer for sale, distribute, display and/or reproduce seditious publications' in this case fell within the most serious category for its type, and the two offences of 'conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security' fell within the category of offences of 'a grave nature'.

  ""As the court pointed out in the reasons for the sentence, these offences took place at a time when Hong Kong had hardly recovered from the social turmoil caused by the 'Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement'. The conspiracies were meticulously planned, involved multiple parties, and were clearly premeditated. The conspiracies involved the use of online platforms and a large number of seditious articles, targeting both local and overseas audiences, and some criminal activities were even conducted outside the HKSAR. The conspiracies were persistent ones, resulting in many acts rather than a single incident. After the enactment of the HKNSL, even though Lai Chee-ying's requests for foreign countries to impose sanctions or blockades, or engage in other hostile activities became more implicit and subtle, the change was only in form rather than in substance, with all the defendants continuing with their agreement for some time until after they were arrested by the Police. In fact, the sanctions imposed by foreign countries against the HKSAR, as well as against officials of China and the HKSAR have not been removed even up to today. It is wholly unrealistic to say that Lai Chee-ying and others' activities were not a contributing cause. The court unequivocally identified Lai Chee-ying as the mastermind and the driving force behind these conspiracies, which constituted an aggravating factor and therefore enhanced the starting point for his sentence.

  ""The Government would forfeit the offence-related property of Lai Chee-ying in accordance with the law. The Secretary for Security has earlier frozen the offence-related property of Lai Chee-ying and of the companies relating to Apple Daily in accordance with the Implementation Rules for Article 43 of the HKNSL. Article 31 of the HKNSL stipulates that the operation of a company or an organisation shall be suspended or its licence or business permit shall be revoked if it has been punished for committing an offence under the HKNSL. The HKSAR Government will initiate the procedures pursuant to section 360C of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32) so as to have the three companies relating to Apple Daily struck off the Companies Register to safeguard national security.""

The spokesman said, ""Since the HKSAR Government has taken action in accordance with the law to combat the illegal acts of Lai Chee-ying endangering national security, many Western countries, overseas anti-China media, organisations and politicians have been continuously smearing the efforts of the HKSAR in safeguarding national security. These countries themselves frequently deploy the tactics of overstretching the concept of national security as a pretext to suppress their own opponents. Moreover, they have been harbouring their agents by constantly slandering Hong Kong, hypocritically cloaking Lai Chee-ying in the false guise of a 'media mogul', and even fabricating health problems of Lai Chee-ying during the trial.

  ""These schemes all crumbled during the fair and impartial public hearings in court. The 855-page verdict handed down by the court provided irrefutable proof and demonstrated the court's fair judgment based strictly on the law and evidence.""

The spokesman further said, ""The Correctional Services Department (CSD) has been ensuring that the custodial environment for persons-in-custody (PICs) is safe, humane, appropriate and healthy in accordance with the law. These include adequate lighting and good ventilation, as well as appropriate and timely medical support. During the plea in mitigation in court on January 13 this year, the senior counsel representing Lai Chee-ying confirmed repeatedly that Lai Chee-ying had made no complaints about the treatment he received while in custody. The court also confirmed in its reasons for sentence that the CSD has been providing adequate medical attention for Lai Chee-ying.

  ""As regards the arrangement of removing Lai Chee-ying from association with other PICs, it has long been made based on his own request by the CSD after considering all relevant factors in accordance with the law. Lai Chee-ying's entitlements in prison, including visitation, communication, welfare and religious services, as well as outdoor exercise arrangements, have not been deprived of on account of his personal status or his removal from association with other PICs.

  ""The HKSAR Government has completed the local legislation on Article 23 of the Basic Law by enacting the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO). The HKNSL and the SNSO are compatible with and complementary to each other, jointly establishing the legal system for safeguarding national security. The HKSAR will continue to resolutely discharge its duty of safeguarding national security, while protecting the legitimate rights and interests of Hong Kong citizens, fulfilling its inherent responsibility, and making every effort to prevent, suppress and punish acts and activities that endanger national security."""

高等法院原訟法庭今日就「黎智英案」作出判刑。行政會議非官守議員表示，黎智英和案中各被告危害國家安全、破壞社會穩定，罪行嚴重。法庭的定罪判決和對各被告作出判決，彰顯了法律的正義，展現法庭嚴格依照法律和證據作出裁決，不受任何干涉。

行政會議非官守議員強調，法庭依法公開、公平審理「黎智英案」，任何人違反法律，都必須依法追究，任何危害國家安全的行為，都必須依法嚴懲，法網難逃。法庭的定罪判決和對各被告作出重判，是堅決維護國家安全、實施《香港國安法》、彰顯法治的重要體現，對防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全行為意義重大，充分體現「一國兩制」實踐行穩致遠。

行政會議非官守議員會繼續全力支持香港特區政府堅定不移全面準確實施《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》及香港特區其他維護國家安全的相關法律，同時依法保障香港市民的權利和自由。"
原訟法庭就「黎智英案」的判刑彰顯公義,2026-02-09 13:20,2026-02-09 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900363.htm,"​高等法院原訟法庭今日（二月九日）就黎智英及另外八名被告，以及《蘋果日報》相關三間公司被控共三項危害國家安全罪行的定罪作出判刑。黎智英在本案的總刑期為20年；其餘八名被告則被判監禁六年三個月至10年不等。《蘋果日報》三間相關公司各被判罰款3,004,500港元。

行政長官李家超表示︰「黎智英罪行滔天，惡貫滿盈，被重判入獄20年，彰顯法治，伸張正義，大快人心。黎智英長期利用《蘋果日報》荼毒市民、煽動仇恨、歪曲事實、蓄意製造社會對立、美化暴力，公然乞求外部勢力制裁中國、制裁香港特區，犧牲人民福祉，賣國禍港，損害國家和香港特區利益，罪證纍纍，罪有應得。」

「黎智英危害國家安全的惡行，傷害國家及香港特區的利益，傷害市民的利益。法庭經過156日公平公正的公開聆訊，審視了多達2 220項證物、超過80 000頁文件、14名控方證人的證供，鐵證如山，證實了黎智英的反中亂港主腦角色，行為齷齪無恥。」

「黎智英的滔天罪行是《香港國安法》公布實施後第一宗獲判罪成的『串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全』案件，是香港特區維護國家安全工作的重要里程碑。《香港國安法》彰顯了『定海神針』的作用，告誡危害國家安全的歹毒之徒難逃法網，必被依法嚴懲。特區會繼續堅定不移維護國家主權、安全、發展利益。」

「法庭依法對黎智英及各被告作出重判，彰顯了法治和公義，然而香港社會已承受了沉重代價。在黎智英和他所操控的《蘋果日報》的荼毒下，部分市民，尤其是青年人，被誤導違反法律，變得激進暴戾，於『黑暴』期間破壞公共設施、衝擊立法會和政府大樓、投擲汽油彈、大肆縱火，更放火燒人。更有年輕人偷運真槍、製造炸彈、策劃恐怖活動，幸得警方及早搗破，才避免了大量人命傷亡。這些被煽動的人，包括年輕人，很多更因犯法而入獄。事實上，截至去年底，有超過2 400人因『黑暴』期間所犯的大小罪行，承擔法律後果，可見黎智英團夥及《蘋果日報》的惡貫滿盈。」

香港特別行政區（特區）政府發言人表示：「法庭早前頒下的裁決清楚指出黎智英為案中主腦，控制和利用《蘋果日報》荼毒社會，多次勾結外國勢力，乞求對中央和香港特區政府實施制裁和採取敵對行動。黎智英的歹毒圖謀跨越《香港國安法》實施前後，目的是勾結外部勢力，損害中國和香港特區的利益、市民的利益，他無恥地充當外部勢力的爪牙，危害國家安全。」

「法庭在一月十二至十三日的聆訊中，聽取各被告就判刑方面的陳詞後，今日頒布判刑理由書，詳述理由，說明對各項判刑因素的考量。法庭裁定本案的『串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及／或複製煽動刊物罪』屬於最嚴重的級別；而兩項『串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪』，屬於罪行重大。」

「法庭於判刑理由書指出，有關罪行是香港在飽受『修例風波』的社會暴亂影響後的一段艱難時期發生，有關串謀不僅經精心策劃，涉及各方參與者，且是早有預謀的。有關串謀涉及使用網上平台，煽動文章數量眾多，觸及本地及海外受眾，部分犯罪活動更是在境外進行。有關串謀持續進行，涉及一連串行為，而非單一事件。在《香港國安法》實施後，雖然黎智英請求外國進行制裁、封鎖或採取其他敵對行動的活動變得含蓄和隱晦，但這只是形式上而非實際上的改變，所有被告仍然繼續推展其犯罪協議，甚至被警方拘捕後仍沒有立即停止。事實上，外國針對香港特區以及針對中國及香港特區政府官員採取的制裁措施，至今仍未撤銷，若說黎智英等人的行為並沒有促成這些制裁措施，是完全不符事實的。法庭清楚指出黎智英是本案的主腦和推手，是加重其罪責的因素，所以提高了他的量刑起點。」

「特區政府會依法充公黎智英的罪行相關財產。保安局局長早前已根據《香港國安法第四十三條實施細則》凍結黎智英及《蘋果日報》相關公司的罪行相關財產。《香港國安法》第三十一條規定，公司、團體等因犯該法規定的罪行受到刑事處罰的，應責令其暫停運作或者吊銷其執照或者營業許可證。特區政府將啓動程序，維護國家安全，按《公司（清盤及雜項條文）條例》（第32章）第360C條，將《蘋果日報》三間相關公司自公司登記冊中剔除。」

​發言人指出：「自特區政府依法打擊黎智英危害國家安全的罪行以來，多個美西方國家、境外反華媒體、組織及政客，不斷抹黑香港特區維護國家安全的工作。這些國家自身經常利用泛國安化手段打壓對手，並為包庇他們的代理人不斷誣衊香港，虛偽地為黎智英披上『傳媒人』的假外衣，更在審訊期間虛構黎智英的健康問題。」

「這些圖謀都在法庭公平公正的公開聆訊中不攻自破。法庭頒下的裁決書長達855頁，羅列了全面和堅實的罪證，鐵證如山，展現了法庭嚴格依照法律和證據的公正裁決。」

發言人進一步表示：「懲教署一直嚴格按照法律規定，確保羈押環境安全、人道、合適和健康，包括充足的照明和良好的通風環境、合適和適時的醫療支援等。在今年一月十三日法庭在聽取求情期間，代表黎智英的資深大律師更再三確認就黎智英在囚待遇沒有任何投訴。法庭在判刑理由中也確認，懲教署有為黎智英提供足夠的醫療服務。」

「至於有關黎智英與其他在囚人士中止交往的安排，一直是按黎智英本人的意願，考慮了所有相關因素後由懲教署依法作出。黎智英的在囚權利，包括探訪、通訊、福利和宗教服務、戶外活動安排等，並不會因其個人身分或與其他在囚人士中止交往而被剝奪。」

「香港特區政府已就《基本法》第二十三條完成本地立法，制定了《維護國家安全條例》。《香港國安法》與《維護國家安全條例》渾然一體，築起維護國家安全的法律保障。特區會堅定不移維護國家安全，確保香港市民的合法權益，履行天經地義的責任，全力防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動。」"
AFCD reminds public not to bring endangered species into Hong Kong or purchase them online illegally (with photos),2026-02-09 11:20,2026-02-09 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900233.htm,"  The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) today (February 9) reminded members of the public not to bring endangered species into Hong Kong or purchase them online without a required licence.

  A spokesman for the AFCD said, ""Some plant and animal species are facing the threat of extinction due to over-exploitation, and the import and export of such species are regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants Ordinance (Cap. 586) is the local legislation that gives effect to CITES in Hong Kong. Under the Ordinance, the import, export, re-export or possession of endangered animals and plants, including their parts and derivatives, is subject to control under a licensing system.""

  Any person who contravenes the Ordinance, even for non-commercial purposes, commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for 10 years upon conviction, and the specimens will also be forfeited. More than 500 related seizures were made in 2025. The specimens seized included orchids (including artificially propagated species such as moth orchid), American ginseng, dried seahorses, gastrodia, dendrobium and shark fins of scheduled shark species.

  ""As the Chinese New Year approaches, there have been a number of recent cases in which members of the public were intercepted by Hong Kong Customs for bringing orchids into Hong Kong from the Chinese Mainland. Members of the public should pay attention to whether the plant and animal products they intend to buy from places outside Hong Kong (including those purchased online) are endangered species. It might not be easy to identify whether the wildlife products originate from endangered species. Therefore, members of the public are advised not to buy such items if they cannot ascertain whether the items are subject to control,"" the spokesman continued.

  The Government is committed to the protection of endangered species. The AFCD and Hong Kong Customs will continue to work closely together and step up their enforcement in combating the illegal trade in endangered species. For information on endangered species, please call 1823 or visit www.cites.hk."
漁護署呼籲市民切勿非法攜帶或網購瀕危物種入境香港（附圖）,2026-02-09 11:20,2026-02-09 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/09/P2026020900235.htm,"漁農自然護理署（漁護署）今日（二月九日）提醒市民，切勿攜帶或網購未領有所須許可證的瀕危動植物入境香港。

漁護署發言人說：「部分動植物遭過度採捕正面臨絕種的威脅，因此其進出口受《瀕危野生動植物種國際貿易公約》（《公約》）規管。本港透過《保護瀕危動植物物種條例》（第586章）（《條例》），實施《公約》的規定。在《條例》下，任何人進口、出口、再出口或管有瀕危動植物（包括其部分和衍生物），均受許可證制度規管。」

任何人違反《條例》有關規定即屬違法（即使並非作商業用途），一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一千萬元及監禁十年，有關物品亦會被沒收。去年，檢獲瀕危物種的個案超過500宗，包括蘭花（如蝴蝶蘭等人工栽培品種）、花旗參、乾海馬、天麻、石斛，以及列明的瀕危鯊魚魚翅等。

發言人續說：「農曆新年將至，近日已錄得多宗市民從中國內地攜帶蘭花返港時被香港海關截獲的個案。市民若計劃在本港以外地方購買動植物產品（包括網購），應事先查證該物種是否屬受管制的瀕危物種。由於要分辨動植物產品是否源自瀕危物種可能並不容易，漁護署建議市民切勿購買未能確認是否受管制的產品。」

政府一直致力保護瀕危物種，漁護署將繼續與香港海關緊密合作，加強執法，打擊瀕危物種非法貿易。市民如欲查詢瀕危物種資訊，可致電1823或瀏覽www.cites.hk。"

Water Supplies Department's clarification on water loss issue in Fairview Park,2026-02-08 23:57,2026-02-09 00:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/08/P2026020800765.htm,"The Fairview Park Small Owners' Rights Association (""the Association"") today (February 8) issued a press release concerning water loss issue in Fairview Park. As the press release contains inaccuracies, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) provides the following clarification to avoid public misunderstanding:

The WSD has consistently discharged its regulatory and enforcement duties in accordance with the law in relation to the water loss issue in Fairview Park. As leakage was detected in the inside service of the Fairview Park, the WSD, pursuant to the powers conferred under section 7 of the Waterworks Ordinance, required the registered agent to follow up and rectify the problem. However, the Association has repeatedly and incorrectly attributed the responsibility for the inside service to the WSD, who is in fact the regulator, and has persistently requested the WSD to undertake the maintenance responsibility of the inside service of the housing estate, including detailed inspection and replacement of watermains. This misrepresentation is completely out of order.

Furthermore, clause 42 of the special conditions of Fairview Park's land lease only stipulates that the Government is responsible for maintenance of the water mains only if they were laid by the Government and are located beneath the roads which have been surrendered to the Government. In fact, the majority of the water mains within Fairview Park were laid by the grantee of the land and therefore the above-mentioned clause 42 is not applicable to these water mains. During the construction of Fairview Park, for the purposes of supplying water to the premises, the WSD only laid a small portion of water mains beneath the roads at the entrance and the areas within the housing estate near the entrance. These roads are still private land and have not been surrendered to the Government. Accordingly, under Section 7 of the Waterworks Ordinance and the land lease, the consumers or the registered agent shall be responsible for custody and maintenance of the water mains within Fairview Park. Despite WSD's repeated explanations, the Association continues to misinterpret the land lease provisions. The WSD urges the Association to cease disseminating inaccurate information.

To address residents' concerns and facilitate proper resolution of the water loss problem, the WSD has engaged an independent expert panel. Leveraging on the advanced technology and expertise, the expert panel will provide third‑party professional advice on the water loss issue, thereby assisting the responsible party of Fairview Park in effective planning of water mains repair works. The expert panel has commenced the work and aims to deliver preliminary findings by April. The expert panel is accountable to the WSD. Upon receipt its advice, the WSD will thoroughly consider the advice in order to plan for the follow-up actions, including providing appropriate technical support for the owners and the management office."
水務署就錦綉花園失水事宜作出說明,2026-02-08 22:10,2026-02-08 22:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/08/P2026020800693.htm,"​錦綉花園小業主權益聯會（下稱「聯會」）今日（二月八日）就錦綉花園失水事宜發出新聞稿，內容有失實之處，水務署現作以下說明，以免「聯會」的公布引起公眾誤會：

水務署在錦綉花園失水事件上，一直依法履行規管及執法職責。由於發現屋苑內部供水系統出現滲漏，署方根據《水務設施條例》第七條賦予的權力，要求註冊代理人跟進處理。然而，「聯會」一再把擔當規管角色的本署，錯誤定性為責任方，並不斷要求署方承擔屋苑內部供水系統的保養維修責任，包括詳細檢查及負責更換水管等工程，實屬本末倒置之舉。

另外，錦綉花園地契特別條款第42條只是列明，倘若屋苑內部水管由政府鋪設，而水管位處的道路並已移交給政府，這些水管則由政府負責維修保養。惟事實上，錦綉花園範圍內大部分水管由土地承批人鋪設，因此並不屬上述地契特別條款的適用範圍。當年在建造錦綉花園時，為了達致供水給屋苑的目的，水務署只是在屋苑出入口及屋苑內鄰近出入口一帶的道路下鋪設小部分的供水喉管，上述道路至今仍屬私人土地，沒有移交給政府。換言之，現時錦綉花園內的供水喉管，根據《水務設施條例》第7條及根據地契，應由用戶或註冊代理人負責保管與保養。儘管署方已經再三說明以上情況，「聯會」仍然對錦綉花園地契作錯誤詮釋，署方希望「聯會」停止發放不實資訊。

為釋除居民的疑慮及讓失水問題盡快得以妥善解決，署方已委託獨立專家小組，利用前沿科技和專業知識，就屋苑失水問題提供第三方專業意見，從而協助錦綉花園責任方為喉管復修工程作出有效部署。專家小組已展開工作，爭取在四月有初步結果。小組直接向水務署負責，署方在接獲其意見後會詳細考慮，以便部署跟進工作，包括為業主及管理公司提供適切的技術支援。"

During the operation, the enforcement officers conducted test-buy operations and suspected that five mobile hawkers were visitors taking up employment or establishing or joining in business in Hong Kong. The five mobile hawkers were subsequently arrested by immigration officers on suspicion of being illegal workers. The arrested illegal workers were five women, aged 20 to 40.

Customs, the ImmD and the Police will continue to step up high-profile patrol and enforcement to resolutely combat different kinds of illegal activities in the vicinity of the event venues during mega events.

Customs reminds consumers to purchase goods at reputable shops and to check with the trademark owners or their authorised agents if the authenticity of a product is in doubt. Traders should be cautious and prudent in merchandising since the sale of counterfeit goods is a serious crime and offenders are liable to criminal sanctions. Under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, any person who sells or possesses for sale any goods with a forged trademark commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

Under the Copyright Ordinance, any person who sells or possesses for sale any infringing goods commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $50,000 per infringing copy and imprisonment for four years.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-02-08 17:30,2026-02-08 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/08/P2026020800492.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（二月八日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。​


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-08 17:30,2026-02-08 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/08/P2026020800493.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 8), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
