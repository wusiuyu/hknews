SJ meets President of Supreme People's Court,2025-10-13 17:55,2025-10-13 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/13/P2025101300643.htm,"The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, met with the President of the Supreme People's Court (SPC), Mr Zhang Jun, today (October 13) to exchange views on issues of mutual concern. The Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, and the Solicitor General, Mr Llewellyn Mui, also attended the meeting.

Mr Lam said that the Department of Justice (DoJ) has always maintained close ties with the SPC. Earlier this year, the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy co-organised the Hong Kong Common Law Practical Training Course in Hong Kong with the SPC. The course provided training for Mainland judges to deepen their understanding of Hong Kong's common law system and promoted exchange and co-operation between the two legal systems.

Both sides also exchanged views on enhancing mutual legal assistance for civil and commercial matters between Hong Kong and the Mainland, promoting the training of the country's foreign-related legal talent and deepening the interfaces of regulatory frameworks and mechanisms for legal and dispute resolution services within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

âMr Lam said that Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction in China under the ""one country, two systems"" principle and maintains a robust legal system highly aligned with international standards. The DoJ will continue to contribute to the country's efforts in training foreign-related legal talent and strive to consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre.

Four films adapted from literature and produced by the Shanghai Film Studio will be screened at the HKFA Cinema on November 15 and 16 for audiences to appreciate interpretations of literary classics in Shanghai films from different perspectives.

  ""Ashima"" (1964) (4K restored version) is China's first major musical filmed in colour and is presented in a widescreen format with stereo sound. The programme will screen the latest 4K version of the restoration that was jointly carried out in 2025 by the Shanghai Film Technology Plant, a subsidiary of the Shanghai Film Group, and the L'Immagine Ritrovata film restoration laboratoryin Italy. With extensive research and fieldwork, the film was adapted from a long narrative poem of the same title by the Sani people, part of the Yi ethnic group in Yunnan, into a tragic love story of resistance against oppression, featuring dazzling sequences of ethnic song and dance that were filmed in Yunnan with meticulous music, art and costumes directions.

  ""The Herdsman"" (1982) (4K restored version), directed by veteran director Xie Jin, is an adaptation of ""Soul and Flesh"", by renowned author Zhang Xianliang. Through its expressive film language and cinematography, the film delicately portrays the emotional journey of an intellectual sent to the northwestern grasslands, revealing a heartfelt and selfless love for family and country.

  ""Forever Young"" (1983) (2K restored version) is based on an early novel by contemporary writer Wang Meng. Set in the early 1950s, it focuses on the school life of a group of graduating female students in a Beijing high school. Director Huang Shuqin offers a sensitive female perspective in her depiction of the joys and sorrows of young women growing up amidst the transition between the old and the new.

  ""Conservatory Garden Very Deeply"" (Part One & Part Two) (1989), directed by Shi Shujun, is an adaptation of popular writer Chiung Yao's eponymous novel. Interweaving the past and present, the narrative of the film explores how young people break free from the constraints of traditional moral codes to pursue individuality and romantic freedom.

  All screenings will be accompanied by post-screening talks hosted by Dr Timmy Chen, Dr Lo Wai-luk, Eric Tsang and Joyce Yang.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-13 17:40,2025-10-13 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/13/P2025101300677.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月十三日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新個案資料

個案涉及一名70歲男子，住所位於油尖旺區。初步調查顯示，他於九月二十日至十月十日獨自到訪廣東省佛山市。他於十月十一日出現發燒及關節痛，翌日（十月十二日）到伊利沙伯醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

他有一名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人於潛伏期身處廣東省，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得33宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（十月五日至十一日）廣東省新增2 257宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與過去兩周分別3 181宗（九月二十八日至十月四日）及3 153宗(九月二十一日至二十七日）有所下降。上周大部分個案（1 255宗）在江門市錄得，其次為廣州（201宗）及佛山（196宗），全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。近期江門市基孔肯雅熱疫情呈波動下降趨勢，但仍在較高水平。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-13 17:40,2025-10-13 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/13/P2025101300678.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 13), one new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

  The case involves a 70-year-old male living in Yau Tsim Mong District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Foshan in Guangdong alone between September 20 and October 10. He developed a fever and joint pain on October 11. He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment on the following day (October 12). He is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing.

  The patient has one household contact, who is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

  Since the patient stayed in Guangdong Province during his incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 33 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 2 257 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (October 5 to 11), showing a decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 3 181 cases (September 28 to October 4) and 3 153 cases (September 21 to 27) respectively. Most of the cases (1 255 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen last week, followed by Guangzhou (201 cases) and Foshan (196 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the number of CF cases in Jiangmen has fluctuated downward recently, the level remained relatively high.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

  â
âThe CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected counterfeit goods and suspected illicit cigarettes worth about $1.7 million (with photo),2025-10-13 16:42,2025-10-13 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/13/P2025101300641.htm,"  Hong Kong Customs on September 11 seized about 3 700 suspected counterfeit goods and about 70 000 suspected illicit cigarettes with a total estimated market value of about $1.7 million at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Hong Kong Port.

  Through risk assessment, Customs on that day intercepted an incoming lorry at the HZMB Hong Kong Port. After inspection, Customs officers found the batch of suspected counterfeit goods, including watches, accessories, mobile phones and handbags, and the batch of suspected illicit cigarettes inside the cargo compartment of the lorry. A 62-year-old male driver was subsequently arrested.

  An initial investigation revealed that the batch of suspected counterfeit goods and suspected illicit cigarettes would have been transhipped to overseas regions.

  The investigation is ongoing and the arrested man has been released on bail pending further investigation.

  Customs will continue to take stringent enforcement action against counterfeit goods and smuggling activities through risk assessment and intelligence analysis.

  Under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, any person who imports or exports any goods to which a forged trademark is applied commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

  Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-10-13 16:30,2025-10-13 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/13/P2025101300543.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (October 13) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From October 5 to 11, the CHP recorded two community-acquired LD cases. Both patients involved had underlying illnesses. The details of the cases are as follows:


a 58-year-old male patient living in Shatin District; and
a 71-year-old male patient living in Sham Shui Po District.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that these are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these two cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of October 11, 129 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年八月在收縮區域的42.3上升至二零二五年九月的43.8，而未來一個月（即二零二五年十月）的業務收益展望動向指數為47.2。按行業分析，業務收益現時動向指數雖低於50的分界線，但所有統計調查涵蓋的行業的相關指數在二零二五年九月均較上月上升，特別是地產業（從43.9上升至47.1）、零售業（從41.1上升至42.8）及物流業（從40.5上升至42.2）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數從二零二五年八月的44.2上升至二零二五年九月的46.5，而未來一個月（即二零二五年十月）的新訂單展望動向指數為47.3。

評論

政府發言人表示，九月中小企的營商氣氛和對未來一個月的預期均進一步改善。整體就業情況穩定。

展望未來，儘管外圍環境的不確定因素持續，但堅挺的本地經濟，加上亞洲其他各地尤其是內地經濟持續增長，將會為本地營商氣氛提供支持。政府會密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指從業人數少於50人的公司。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於規模較大的公司的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己公司情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for September 2025,2025-10-13 16:30,2025-10-13 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/13/P2025101300337.htm,"The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (October 13) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for September 2025.

The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs increased from 42.3 in August 2025 in the contractionary zone to 43.8 in September 2025, whereas the one-month’s ahead (i.e. October 2025) outlook DI on business receipts was 47.2. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts, despite below the 50-mark, rose in September 2025 as compared with previous month for all surveyed sectors, particularly for the real estate (from 43.9 to 47.1), retail trade (from 41.1 to 42.8) and logistics (from 40.5 to 42.2).

The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades increased from 44.2 in August 2025 to 46.5 in September 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month’s time (i.e. October 2025) was 47.3.

Commentary

A Government spokesman said that business sentiment among SMEs and their outlook in one month’s time both showed further improvements in September. The overall employment situation was stable.

Looking ahead, the resilient local economy, together with sustained growth in other economies in Asia, in particular the Mainland, will provide support to business sentiment in Hong Kong, notwithstanding the ongoing uncertainties in the external environment. The Government will monitor the situation closely.

Further information

The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to companies with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent companies in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own companies rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300).

衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-10-13 16:30,2025-10-13 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/13/P2025101300538.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（十月十三日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在十月五日至十一日期間，衞生防護中心錄得兩宗社區感染的退伍軍人病個案，兩名病人均有長期病患。詳情如下：


58歲男病人，居於沙田區；及
71歲男病人，居於深水埗區。


衞生防護中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這兩宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至十月十一日，今年錄得129宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


​市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及
避免在通風較差的環境工作，如密封的溫室。

The drill also aimed to prepare the cybersecurity readiness capabilities for the upcoming 15th National Games and the Legislative Council General Election, which will be held in November and December this year respectively.

  Following the success of the first Hong Kong Cybersecurity Attack and Defence Drill organised by the DPO last year, the overall scale of the drill this year was significantly expanded to cover more public services. A total of 34 government departments and public organisations participated as defenders (Blue Teams), while the number of Red Teams acting as attackers increased to 15. They comprised experienced Hong Kong and Mainland cybersecurity professional practitioners, higher education institutions and three leading attacking teams recommended by the Cyberspace Administration of Guangdong Province, fully reflecting the collaboration and exchanges in cybersecurity between Guangdong and Hong Kong.

  The Commissioner for Digital Policy, Mr Tony Wong, witnessed the successful conclusion of this year's Hong Kong Cybersecurity Attack and Defence Drill at the event's venue last night (October 12), alongside representatives from the co-organisers. He expressed gratitude to all co-organisers, the Red and Blue Teams, referees and support staff, and encouraged all parties to continue joining forces to strengthen Hong Kong's cybersecurity defence capability.

  The drill, which was launched on October 10 and spanned three days for a total of 60 hours, was conducted in a controlled manner. The Red Teams, acting as attackers, launched simulated cyberattacks in a strictly controlled environment on designated information systems and electronic service platforms of participating government departments and public organisations which are already in operation to identify potential security risks and vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, the Blue Teams tried their best to fend off these attacks in daily system operation scenarios. All participating systems and services remained in normal operation during the drill. Reports of the drill will be provided to the relevant participating government departments or public organisations for reference and follow ups.

  In addition, over 250 representatives from more than 60 government departments and organisations took part in the drill on-site as observers to monitor the operation and progress of the exercise and learn more about the latest trends in cybersecurity threats. The Deputy Commissioner (Digital Infrastructure), Mr Daniel Cheung, also visited the drill venue and communicated with the Red Teams, referees, and support staff to understand the progress of the drill."
立法會秘書處發布「香港金融科技和數字資產的最新發展」的《專題快訊》,2025-10-13 15:22,2025-10-13 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/13/P2025101300509.htm,"下稿代立法會秘書處發出：

立法會秘書處（秘書處）今日（十月十三日）發布最新一期《專題快訊》――「香港金融科技和數字資產的最新發展」，簡介香港近年在金融科技、數字資產、綠色可持續金融及跨境金融領域等方面，如何透過科技進行創新與應用，並綜述立法會的相關討論和建議。

香港作為國際金融中心，擁有健全的監管體系、豐富的營商機遇和活躍的融資市場，結合內聯外通的獨特優勢，是推動金融科技與第三代互聯網（Web3）融合發展的首選樞紐。根據最新公布的《全球金融中心指數》，香港繼續穩居全球第三大國際金融中心，位列亞太區首位，而在金融科技領域更是位列全球第一。

立法會一直關注Web3和數字資產技術的應用和發展，並早着先機，於二○二三年十月成立Web3及虛擬資產發展事宜小組委員會，研究相關事宜。《專題快訊》綜述議員向政府當局提出的建議，包括完善數字資產規管框架，以保障投資者；加強為金融、貿易、會計及法律等多個行業的從業員提供Web3和金融科技的在職培訓；以及在中學課程引入區塊鏈、代幣化等技術概念，普及公眾對數字資產及Web3技術的知識。

在穩定幣監管方面，立法會於今年五月通過《穩定幣條例草案》，為錨定法定貨幣的穩定幣發行人設立發牌制度，規管穩定幣的發行和相關活動，並賦權金融管理專員進行調查及執法，使香港成為全球首批制訂穩定幣發行人監管制度的地區之一。

《專題快訊》指出，政府因應議員的建議，對《條例草案》提出多項修正案，包括在原有建議的四類認許提供者之外，容許儲值支付工具持牌人亦可銷售法幣穩定幣。議員認為這有助推動法幣穩定幣在本港的廣泛應用。放眼未來，議員建議爭取中央支持，在本港發展離岸人民幣穩定幣，並在數字資產和加密貨幣等金融新興領域敢於探索實踐，發揮好「穩定幣試驗田」作用。

《專題快訊》亦闡述，香港透過發行代幣化綠色債券、拓寬本地綠色金融科技生態圈等，推動綠色和可持續金融發展。至今，在香港安排發行的綠色和可持續債券總額約四百三十億美元，自二○一八年起連續七年居亞洲區市場的首位。議員促請政府當局制訂措施，吸引內地企業來港進行相關的融資和認證測試，提升香港作為綠色和可持續債券發行平台的吸引力。議員亦建議當局研究利用區塊鏈技術，將碳信用進行代幣化的可行性。

《專題快訊》指出，香港作為區內重要的金融科技樞紐，已建立多個跨地域金融合作平台，以推動金融科技創新，加強與國際市場的連結。其中，作為年度盛事的香港金融科技周，將與StartmeupHK創業節同於今年十一月舉行，預計吸引逾三萬名來自全球一百多個經濟體的行業領袖、演講嘉賓及參展商參與。為吸引更多合規金融科技企業落户香港，議員建議政府當局持續優化監管框架，鼓勵金融科技試驗，進一步簡化發牌程序，並推動傳統產業數字化升級轉型，與大灣區內地城市優勢互補，從而為國家的新興產業和數字經濟的創新發展作出貢獻。

「香港金融科技和數字資產的最新發展」的詳細內容可於立法會網頁瀏覽。《專題快訊》由秘書處議會事務部編製，旨在聚焦介紹特定議題、剖析政策發展，並綜述立法會相關討論。"
"LegCo Secretariat releases Policy Pulse on ""Latest developments in fintech and digital assets in Hong Kong""",2025-10-13 15:22,2025-10-13 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/13/P2025101300517.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Legislative Council Secretariat:

The Legislative Council (LegCo) Secretariat today (October 13) released the latest issue of the Policy Pulse on ""Latest developments in fintech and digital assets in Hong Kong"". This issue provides a brief overview of how Hong Kong has leveraged technology for innovation and application in the areas such as financial technology (fintech), digital assets (DA), green and sustainable finance and cross-border finance, as well as relevant discussions of LegCo along with suggestions by Members.

As an international financial centre, Hong Kong possesses a robust regulatory system, rich business opportunities and an active financing market. Coupled with its unique advantages of connecting with the Mainland and the world, Hong Kong stands as a premier hub for promoting the integrated development of fintech and the third generation Internet (Web3). According to the newly published Global Financial Centres Index, Hong Kong continued to rank third globally and first in Asia Pacific. On fintech offering, Hong Kong even ranked first in the world.

LegCo has long attached great importance to the development and application of Web3 and DA technologies, and get a head start to form the Subcommittee on Issues Relating to the Development of Web3 and Virtual Assets in October 2023 to study relevant matters. The Policy Pulse summarises Members' recommendations made to the Government, including refining the DA regulatory framework to protect investors; enhancing on-the-job training on Web3 and fintech for practitioners in financial, trading, accounting and legal sectors; and introducing technological concepts such as blockchain and tokenisation into the secondary school curriculum to promote public knowledge of DA and Web3 technologies.

Regarding the regulation of stablecoins, LegCo enacted the Stablecoins Bill in May this year, establishing a licensing regime for issuers of stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, governing the issuance and related activities of stablecoins, and providing the Monetary Authority with investigatory and enforcement powers. Hong Kong has become one of the first jurisdictions in the world to establish a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers.

The Policy Pulse points out that, in the light of Members' suggestions, the Government proposed amendments to the Bill, including allowing stored value facility licensees, in addition to the four types of permitted offerors originally proposed, to offer fiat-referenced stablecoins (FRS). In Members' view, this will help promote the wider use of FRS in Hong Kong. Looking ahead, Members suggest seeking the Central Government's support to develop offshore Renminbi stablecoins in Hong Kong, and to boldly explore and practise in emerging financial areas such as DAs and cryptocurrencies, thereby leveraging the role of a ""stablecoins testing ground"".

The Policy Pulse also details that Hong Kong promotes the development of green and sustainable finance by issuing tokenised green bonds and expanding the local green fintech ecosystem. To date, the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong has amounted to around US$43 billion, ranking first in the Asian market for seven consecutive years since 2018. Members urge the Government to formulate measures to attract Mainland enterprises to conduct relevant financing and certification testing in Hong Kong, thereby enhancing the city's attractiveness as a platform for green and sustainable bond issuance. Members also suggest that the Government should explore the feasibility of tokenising carbon credits using blockchain technology.

The Policy Pulse points out that Hong Kong, as a key fintech hub in the region, has established multiple cross-regional financial co-operation platforms to drive fintech innovation and strengthen linkage with international markets. Among these, the annual Hong Kong FinTech Week will be held together with the StartmeupHK Festival in November this year, bringing together over 30,000 industry leaders, speakers and exhibitors from over 100 economies worldwide. To attract more compliant fintech enterprises to establish presence in Hong Kong, Members urge the Government to continuously refine the regulatory framework, encourage trials of financial technology, further streamline licensing process, and promote upgrading and transformation of traditional industries towards digitalisation, thereby promoting complementarity of advantages with the Mainland cities in the Greater Bay Area, as well as contributing to the emerging industries and the innovative development of the digital economy of the country.

The detailed content of ""Latest developments in fintech and digital assets in Hong Kong"" is available on the LegCo Website. The Policy Pulse, published by the Council Business Divisions of the LegCo Secretariat, covers specific topics and offers a comprehensive overview of related policy developments and summarizes discussions in LegCo."

"Hong Kong holds Eighth Seminar of Senior Judges from across Strait, Hong Kong and Macao (with photos)",2025-10-13 13:25,2025-10-13 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/13/P2025101300321.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Judiciary:

  The Hong Kong Judiciary is hosting the Eighth Seminar of Senior Judges from across the Strait, Hong Kong and Macao today and tomorrow (October 13 and 14), under the theme of ""The Emerging Challenges and Opportunities in Judicial Work"".

  The President of the China Association of Judges, Mr Zhang Jun; the President of the Court of Final Appeal of Macao, Ms Song Man-lei; and the Chairman of the Chinese Society of Law of Taiwan, Mr Chen Tzung-chen, are attending this high-level seminar with their official delegations. The seminar was officially launched today upon the delivery of opening speeches by the Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong, and other heads of delegations.

  Addressing the seminar, Chief Justice Cheung said that in a rapidly changing world, the Hong Kong Judiciary faces both challenges and opportunities. While steadfastly upholding the rule of law and judicial independence, the Hong Kong Judiciary has been taking a clear-eyed view of the times and responding proactively. He highlighted four key strategic directions of the Hong Kong Judiciary: streamlining procedures and strengthening case management; advancing alternative dispute resolution; strengthening co-operation with the Mainland and other jurisdictions; and accelerating judicial technology with prudent application, seizing opportunities for institutional and technological innovation. He remarked that today's seminar was not only an occasion for exchanging experiences; it was also a moment for identifying solutions together and grasping new opportunities. ""Courts across the Strait, Hong Kong and Macao would inspire one another, pool our wisdom, and together enhance the efficiency and capability of courts in their respective jurisdictions, thereby advancing the rule of law,"" Chief Justice Cheung said.

  In her address at the seminar, Ms Song said that practitioners of judicial work bear a significant responsibility for upholding social fairness and justice, as well as safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the people. In the face of challenges and opportunities of the new era, it is essential to maintain an open attitude, proactively explore innovation, and continuously enhance the quality and efficiency of judicial work. She expressed her wish that the seminar would inject new strength into the judicial co-operation and exchange among the Mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, making new contributions towards the advancement of the judicial quality of the Chinese people.

  Meanwhile, Mr Chen remarked that this judicial seminar would facilitate mutual exchange and collaborations seeking to draw up more pragmatic and appropriate mechanisms and regulations for effectively addressing judicial issues, adapt to changing times and societal needs, and collectively foster the progress and prosperity of the Chinese people.

  Mr Zhang pointed out that with the evolving global trend towards peace, development, co-operation, and mutual benefits, new threats and challenges continue to emerge. The judiciaries must proactively adapt to the demands for security, development, people's livelihoods and governance, thereby contributing towards building China into a greater country and achieving rejuvenation of the Chinese people. The judicial and legal sectors across the Strait, as well as in Hong Kong and Macao, should collectively sustain the outstanding traditions of Chinese legal culture, continue to uphold the rule of law principles: prioritising the people, ensuring fairness and justice, punishing wrongdoers while rewarding good behaviour, and integrating moral values with the law. He remarked that this would help address contemporary challenges, forge a clearer consensus on the rule of law, and pool strengths for development. He also highlighted the significant achievements of the Supreme People's Court under the guidance of President Xi Jinping's thoughts on the rule of law, especially in serving the broader picture and ensuring justice for the people. He shared practices and experiences from four perspectives: strict and fair administration of justice, upholding justice for the people, integrating into social governance, and co-ordinating the judicial use of artificial intelligence. These efforts demonstrate how the modernisation of the trial work can support and serve China's overall development.

  Mr Zhang expressed his wish that members of the judicial and legal communities across the Strait, as well as in Hong Kong and Macao, would keep abreast of historical developments, protect the collective interests of the Chinese people, adhere to the original intentions of the seminar, and uphold a spirit of co-operation. Together, they work collectively to maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao, promote peaceful cross-Strait relations, and work in unity for the well-being of all compatriots, contributing towards the great cause of rejuvenation of the Chinese people.

  During the seminar, the delegates have been discussing and exchanging views on four topics, namely ""Building Alternative Civil and Commercial Dispute Resolution Mechanisms"", ""Enhancement of Civil and Commercial Court Procedure"", ""Application of Artificial Intelligence"", and ""Practice and Development of the Doctrine of Precedent"". About 160 representatives from the judicial and legal sectors of the Mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao will be attending the seminar.

  The closing ceremony will be held tomorrow.

  The seminar is a regular exchange forum among the judicial and legal sectors of the Mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. It has been held every two years since 2011. Following the success of the fourth seminar in 2017, Hong Kong is once again hosting the seminar this year."

Agnes (Chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC), Ms Agnes Chan), Anthony (Chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries (FHKI), Mr Anthony Lam), Jeffrey (Member, Legislative Council - Commercial (First) and HKGCC’s LegCo Representative, Mr Jeffrey Lam), Mr Saeed Uddin (Chairman of the Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning.

  It is a real pleasure to join you today at this important forum as we explore how Hong Kong can tap into the vast and growing opportunities presented by the global Halal economy. My sincere thanks to the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Hong Kong Industries for bringing us together for this timely and meaningful dialogue.

The global Halal economy

  The global Halal economy is expanding at an impressive pace. The 57 member countries of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, or the OIC, currently account for around 8 per cent of the world’s GDP. Yet, their contribution to global growth is striking, reaching 15 per cent last year and projected to surpass 20 per cent by 2030.

  These economies are undergoing deep structural transformation. In the Middle East, governments are diversifying beyond oil into sectors such as finance, technology, tourism and real estate. In Asia, countries like Indonesia and Malaysia are accelerating industrial development, capturing opportunities from shifting global supply chains. Foreign direct investment into OIC countries has risen substantially, now making up around 14 per cent of global inflows, nearly three times the level a decade ago.

  At the same time, consumer markets in Muslim economies are expanding rapidly. According to the World Bank, household consumption in OIC countries has already surpassed US$5 trillion. Notably, this growth is driven by three key forces.

  First, demographics. The Muslim world is home to over 2 billion people, with nearly 60 per cent under the age of 30. This represents a vibrant, young and increasingly affluent consumer base.

  Second, the rise of ethical consumerism. Halal-certified products are valued for their safety, hygiene, and ethical standards. They are gaining popularity not only among Muslim consumers but also across global markets.

  Third, digital transformation. E-commerce and online platforms are making it easier for Halal products to reach international audiences, further fuelling demand and opening new channels for trade.

  These developments are unfolding as China strengthens its commitment to high-level two-way opening up, and deepens its engagement with Belt and Road partners as well as the Global South. Over the past decade, exports from the Chinese Mainland to OIC countries have grown by more than 80 per cent, reaching nearly US$600 billion. Imports from these countries have increased by around 60 per cent to US$450 billion. At the same time, outbound investment to OIC markets has surged by over 130 per cent, reaching US$100 billion.

Hong Kong’s role and strategic advantage

  Ladies and gentlemen, the changing landscape is presenting new opportunities for us.

  Under the “one country, two systems” framework, Hong Kong offers unparalleled connectivity with, and understanding of, both the Chinese Mainland and the international market. We serve as a trusted two-way platform for Mainland and Hong Kong enterprises looking to expand into Muslim economies, and for investors and entrepreneurs from these economies to access opportunities in China and beyond.

  Looking ahead, our strategy centres on three fronts: strengthening trade and investment, advancing financial collaboration and enhancing cultural exchanges.

Strengthening trade and investment ties

  First, about boosting two-way trade and investment. We are adopting a two-pronged approach: proactively reaching out to Muslim markets and bringing investors and business delegations from there to Hong Kong.

  Over the past three years, the Chief Executive, my colleagues and I have led a number of high-level delegations to the Middle East as well as Indonesia and Malaysia. From my own experience, I am encouraged by their strong recognition of the “Hong Kong” brand, which is widely seen as a symbol of quality, good value and professionalism. As more Mainland enterprises look to go global, Hong Kong is in the best position to serve as a launchpad for them. That is why we have been inviting leading Mainland companies to join our overseas delegations, helping them explore the international market through Hong Kong.

  Later this month, I will lead a delegation to Saudi Arabia, bringing together a strong team of Hong Kong and Mainland companies in sectors such as artificial intelligence, biotech, fintech, green energy and more.

  Meanwhile, we are also expanding our presence in Muslim markets. A new Economic and Trade Office will open in Kuala Lumpur later this year, and we are pressing ahead with the plan to establish another office in Riyadh.

  Here in Hong Kong, we are seeing a growth of bilateral investment events. The Investopia Summit with the UAE is a recent example. In July next year, we will welcome Saudi Arabia’s LEAP innovation conference to Hong Kong, its first edition outside the Middle East.

  The Hong Kong Trade Development Council is featuring more Halal products and services in our trade shows and exhibitions, such as Halal food and logistics. We look forward to scaling up these efforts.

Advancing financial collaboration

  The second focus is financial collaboration. As a leading international financial centre, Hong Kong is well positioned to support the growth of Islamic finance and cross-border financial products.

  We already have the legal and regulatory frameworks in place to support Sharia-compliant instruments like sukuk. To date, the HKSAR Government has issued over US$3 billion in sukuk. In recent years, we have also made progress in ETFs with the Islamic markets, particularly Saudi Arabia. In 2023, Hong Kong launched Asia’s first ETF tracking the Saudi market. This was followed by the listing of two Hong Kong ETFs in Saudi Arabia last year. Earlier this year, Asia’s first investment-grade government sukuk ETF was launched in Hong Kong.

  To support the long-term development in this space, we are also investing in talent. Professionals with experience in Islamic finance have been added to our city’s Talent List.

Deepening cultural exchanges

  The third focus is cultural exchange. Tourism is an important pillar. Indeed, in the first eight months of this year, Hong Kong welcomed nearly 500 000 visitors from Indonesia and Malaysia, a 10 per cent increase year on year. Visitors from the Middle East were about 54 000, up nearly 40 per cent.

  We are working to ensure that our tourism and hospitality sector is increasingly welcoming to Muslim travellers. Today, Hong Kong has over 190 Halal-certified restaurants and more than 60 Muslim-friendly hotels and attractions. The Hong Kong Tourism Board has introduced funding schemes to support Halal-certification processes and more dining options. I’m also pleased to note that in August, the Federation of Hong Kong Industries and the Islamic Community Fund launched the Hong Kong Q-Mark Halal Scheme, which will further strengthen the service quality and recognition of restaurants.

  These efforts are already gaining international recognition. Hong Kong was recently named the “Most Promising Muslim-Friendly Destination” by the Global Muslim Travel Index. Our next step is to scale up our international promotion, so that more Muslim travellers will discover what Hong Kong has to offer. This will further reinforce our mutual business, investment and people-to-people relationships.

  Of course, beyond tourism, we look forward to deepening cultural exchange with the Muslim world through mutual participation in each other’s festivals and programmes, ranging from film and music to the performing arts.

A shared opportunity

  Ladies and gentlemen, the rise of the Halal economy reflects a broader shift that signals the growing economic influence of the Global South.

  Hong Kong’s engagement with this region is not only commercially strategic. It is also in alignment with our national development strategy and our role as a “super connector” and “super value-adder” between China and the world.

  The path ahead is clear: to deepen engagement, to build new partnerships and friendships, and to co-create high-quality products and services that cater to the needs of the Muslim communities.

  This is an endeavour that requires collaboration across sectors, industries and borders. Let’s work together to unlock new opportunities and bring benefits for our businesses and people.

  On this note, let me once again thank the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Hong Kong Industries for convening this forum, and I look forward to the insights from our distinguished panellists. I wish you all a productive discussion and a very successful future.

  Thank you very much."

Accompanied by pianist Leona Cheung, the soprano will showcase her extended vocal range and resonant timbre through a selection of classical opera arias and contemporary music pieces, guiding audiences into a musical world interwoven with romance, fairy-tale enchantment, poetic subtlety and whimsical fantasy.

In this concert, Viola Cheung will not only perform beloved lieder, including Schubert's ""So lasst mich scheinen, bis ich werde"" and Berg's ""Sieben frühe Lieder"", but will also present a selection of songs inspired by fairy tales. Among these are three opera arias: ""Ah! Douce Enfant"" from Massenet's ""Cendrillon"", which marks the entrance of the Fairy Godmother; ""It's my Wedding"" from Dove's ""The Enchanted Pig"", where Adelaide, the witch's daughter, finds herself arranged to marry a prince who has been cursed into a pig; and ""Wo ich bin"" from Humperdinck's ""Hansel and Gretel"", sung by Gretel just before the siblings discover the enchanted gingerbread house.

  The performance will also encompass several art songs by female composers: Vieu's ""La Belle au bois dormant"" is a ""sung waltz"" depicting the fairy-tale Sleeping Beauty awakened by the Prince's melody, while Bonis' ""Trois Melodies"" and Lehmann's ""Five Little Love Songs"" capture different facets and sentiments of love. A selection of songs in French will also add exotic flavours to the programme, such as Debussy's ""Rondel Chinois"" and Ravel's ""Cinq Mélodies Populaires Grecques"". The evening will conclude with the coloratura aria ""Doll Song"" from Offenbach's opera ""Tales of Hoffmann"" - sung by the mechanical doll Olympia, the poet Hoffmann's first love - adding a final touch of operatic fantasy that brings the concert to a captivating close.

  Viola Cheung was awarded the scholarship of Best Student in Concentrated Studies by Hong Kong Baptist University and elected as one of the ""Young Music Makers"" by Radio Television Hong Kong in 2015. She continued her music studies in the Netherlands and obtained Master's Degrees from both the Royal Conservatoire of The Hague and the Codarts Rotterdam. She has been invited to perform different roles in operas around the world in recent years after her successful debut as Königin der Nacht in Mozart's ""Die Zauberflöte"" in 2017, and has featured in more than 30 premieres of new compositions.

  The ""Hong Kong Artists"" Series: Vocal Recital by Viola Cheung will be staged at 8pm on November 13 (Thursday) at the Theatre of Hong Kong City Hall. Tickets priced at $200 and $240 are now available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288.

是次演唱會中，張穎琳除會獻唱受歡迎的德語作品，包括舒伯特的《就讓我如此呈現》和貝爾格的《七首早期歌曲》外，亦會帶來多首有關童話故事的歌曲，其中三首為歌劇的詠嘆調，包括選自馬斯奈《仙履奇緣》中神仙教母出場時所唱的〈好孩子〉、多夫《中了魔法的豬》中由女巫之女阿德萊德被安排與被下咒變為豬的王子成婚時所唱的〈這是我的婚禮〉和堪柏定克《糖果屋》中小兄妹二人發現糖果屋前由妹妹葛蕾桃所唱的〈我在哪裡〉。

演出亦涵蓋多首女作曲家的藝術作品：維耶的《林中的睡美人》乃一首「華爾滋歌曲」，描繪童話中睡公主被王子的歌聲喚醒；博尼斯的《三首歌曲》和萊曼的《五首情歌小品》則捕捉愛情的不同階段和感覺。部分選唱的法語歌曲則富有異國情調，如德布西的《中國詩歌迴旋曲》和拉威爾的《五首希臘民謠》。最後以選自奧芬巴赫《荷夫曼的故事》歌劇中詩人荷夫曼的初戀奧林匹克（實為機械人）所唱的花腔詠嘆調〈玩偶之歌〉作結，為全晚的演出添上奇幻的戲劇魅力。

張穎琳曾獲香港浸會大學頒發「最佳專修生獎學金」，二○一五年獲香港電台選為「樂壇新秀」，其後赴荷蘭深造，先後於海牙皇家音樂學院和鹿特丹皇家音樂學院取得碩士學位。她自二○一七年成功首度出演莫扎特歌劇《魔笛》中的夜后一角後，多年來獲邀在世界各地的歌劇演出中擔演不同的角色，並曾參與30多部新作品首演。

「香港藝術家」系列：張穎琳女高音演唱會十一月十三日（星期四）晚上八時在香港大會堂劇院舉行，票價分200元及240元，現於城市售票網（www.urbtix.hk）發售。電話購票請致電3166 1288。十一月至十二月期間舉行的「香港藝術家」系列2025節目還包括十一月三日舉行的沈靖韜與陳蒨瑩鋼琴及小提琴演奏會和十二月一日舉行的「箏言琴語」—— 楊程皓古箏演奏會。查詢節目詳情及購票優惠，請致電2268 7321或瀏覽www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/Programme/tc/music/programs_1843.html。

DH starts accepting applications for clinic licences and requests for letters of exemption for small practice clinics,2025-10-13 09:00,2025-10-13 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/13/P2025101000315.htm,"The regulatory regime for clinics and small practice clinics (SPCs) under the Private Healthcare Facilities Ordinance (Cap. 633) came into effect today (October 13). The Department of Health (DH) started accepting applications for clinic licences (see annex) and requests for letters of exemption for SPCs on the same day.

The Ordinance regulates premises where registered medical practitioners and/or registered dentists practise. Operators of clinics must obtain a relevant licence, while operators of SPCs may request a letter of exemption instead to continue operation. Licensees must at all times comply with the Ordinance, licence conditions and the Code of Practice for Clinics issued by the Director of Health (DoH).

Application details
--------------------

For clinics already in operation on or before November 30, 2018 (i.e. the gazettal date for the enactment of the Ordinance), their operators may submit applications for clinic licences from today to April 13, 2026 (both dates inclusive). As a transitional arrangement, depending on the circumstances, the DH may issue a provisional licence which allows these clinics to continue their operation before a full licence is issued. This allows operators to make the necessary modifications to their clinics to comply with licensing requirements, such as modification of the accommodation layout. A provisional licence will expire on the date specified by the Secretary for Health for the expiry of provisions pertaining toprovisional licences; upon issuance of a full licence to the licensee; or upon withdrawal or rejection of the full licence application.

For clinics that commenced operation after November 30, 2018, including new establishments or those relocated to new premises, their operators must apply directly for a full licence.

For SPCs (i.e. no more than five registered medical practitioners and/or registered dentists that meet specific conditions under the Ordinance), their operators may submit a request for a letter of exemption to the DoH starting from today for continued operation without obtaining a licence.

Starting today, operators of all clinics and SPCs can apply for clinic licences or request for letters of exemption for SPCs through the DH's ""e-Licensing"" System. They can submit their digital signatures via the ""iAM Smart+"" app to complete the entire application process electronically. Through the system, applicants can check the status of application in real time, and receive electronic licences or letters of exemption once their applications are approved.

DH provides the industry with full support in making applications
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To ensure that the industry has a comprehensive understanding of the requirements of the Ordinance, the DH has explained the legal requirements and application procedures to stakeholders in the healthcare sector through various channels, including conducting a number of online and offline briefing sessions to address industry enquiries. The DH will continue to organise monthly online briefing sessions from November this year to April next year to explain relevant requirements to stakeholders, including clinic and SPC operators and doctors. For enrolment details, please visit DH's website.

​本港錄得今年首宗兒童感染流感的死亡個案　衞生防護中心呼籲學童盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-10-12 18:45,2025-10-12 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/12/P2025101200497.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）日前公布一宗兒童感染乙型流感的嚴重個案，13歲患者今日（十月十二日）情況轉差，不幸病逝。中心再次呼籲學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港自去年六月以來，首次有兒童因感染季節性流感而死亡。本港正值夏季流感季節，學校的流感樣疾病爆發個案自九月起大幅上升。截至十月十日，九月開學後涉及學校的爆發個案共有337宗，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（35宗）、小學（182宗）及中學（120宗）。計及上述個案，中心由開學至今錄得九宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重和一宗死亡個案，年齡介乎3至17歲，其中八人過往的健康狀況良好。」

二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃已經展開，為合資格的高風險群組透過各項疫苗注射計劃免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗。今年所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗以及「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。

徐樂堅醫生續說：「除了香港，鄰近地區的季節性流感活躍程度亦上升，日本已宣布進入流感季節，較去年早。流感病毒會不斷變異，因此，流感疫苗亦要每年更新。即使上一季度曾接種季節性流感疫苗，市民仍然要接種新一季度最新的疫苗，方可在未來一年的流感季節得到保護。對高危人士而言，流感可引致嚴重疾病，而健康人士亦會受影響。接種流感疫苗是其中一種最有效預防季節性流感及其併發症的方法，亦可減低因流感而入院留醫和死亡的個案。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。」

他提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

有關最新的流感資訊，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"
CHP urges schoolchildren to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as Hong Kong records its first fatal case of paediatric influenza infection this year,2025-10-12 18:45,2025-10-12 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/12/P2025101200512.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health recently announced a case of severe paediatric influenza B infection. The 13-year-old patient's condition deteriorated today (October 12) and unfortunately passed away. The CHP reiterated its appeal to schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

""This is the first fatal case of paediatric influenza infection in Hong Kong since June last year. Hong Kong is currently in the summer influenza season and there has been a significant increase in influenza-like illness outbreaks in schools since September. As of October 10, 337 outbreaks have been reported in schools since the start of the school year in September, including 35 cases in kindergartens/child care centres, 182 cases in primary schools and 120 cases in secondary schools. Including the above case, nine severe and one fatal paediatric influenza cases involving children aged 3 to 17 have been recorded since the start of the school year. Eight of them had good past health,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The 2025/26 SIV Programmes have commenced, offering free or subsidised SIV to eligible high-risk groups through various vaccination programmes. This year, all schools may choose to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV nasal vaccines) and ""hybrid mode"", i.e. schools are allowed to choose both injectable inactivated influenza vaccines and LAIV for the same or different outreach vaccination activities.

  ""Seasonal influenza activity is also rising in neighbouring regions beyond Hong Kong. Japan has declared the onset of its influenza season, which is earlier than last year. As influenza viruses constantly mutate, the influenza vaccine must be updated annually. Even if individuals received the SIV last season, they should still get the latest vaccine for the new season to ensure protection against the current strain of influenza. Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high-risk individuals and even in healthy persons. SIV is one of the most effective ways of preventing seasonal influenza and its complications, as well as reducing influenza-related hospitalisation and death. The SIV is recommended for all persons aged six months or above, except those with known contraindications. Those at higher risk of contracting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive the SIV as soon as possible."" Dr Tsui added.

Dr Tsui reminded the public that, if they develop a fever and respiratory symptoms, especially among children, elderly and those with chronic conditions, they should seek medical attention promptly for early treatment. High-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

For the latest information on seasonal influenza, members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."
