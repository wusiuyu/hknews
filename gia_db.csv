"Public Healthcare Fees and Charges Reform Strengthens Protection for Poor, Acute, Serious and Critical Patients Number of Waiver Recipients is 3.5 times Annual Total of Previous Year",2026-01-09 20:01,2026-01-09 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900430.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

  The Hospital Authority (HA) spokesperson announced today (January 9) that in addition to the 600 000 people who have been benefiting from medical fee waivers both before and after the reform (including Comprehensive Social Security Assistance recipients, Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 75 or above, and holders of Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme Level 0 vouchers), as of January 7, the HA has approved 49 310 medical fee waiver applications. This figure is 3.5 times of approximately 14 000 patients who received medical fee waivers in previous year, demonstrating that the enhanced medical fee reduction mechanism has significantly strengthened support for low-income families and underprivileged groups. Over the past week, many patients have benefited from the enhanced medical fee waivers mechanism, receiving immediate fee reduction when using Accident and Emergency Departments (A&E), outpatient and inpatient services.

Medical fee waivers take effect covering more than 10 000 poor patients

As an essential component of the public healthcare fees and charges reform, the HA expanded its medical fee waivers mechanism at the same time, which significantly increased the number of eligible individuals from approximately 300 000 to about 1.4 million - around 4.6 times the previous number of beneficiaries. This ensures that limited medical resources can be more precisely directed to help those most in need: the poor, acute, serious, and critical patients. As of January 7, among the 49 310 medical fee waiver applications approved by the HA, 32 249 cases have completed assessment and received formal waiver certificates valid for up to 18 months but claimed . For patients who claim to meet the medical fee waivers eligibility criteria but are unable to submit supporting documents for financial assessment, the HA has exercised flexible arrangements to approve 17 061 ""conditional waivers"", allowing patients to obtain immediate medical fee reductions when using public healthcare services. These patients must submit relevant documentation within three months.

After the fees and charges reform, many patients are benefited for the first time from the expanded medical fee waivers mechanism, changing from paying full fees to receiving free services. From January 1 to 7, excluding the number of Comprehensive Social Security Assistance recipients, Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 75 or above, and holders of Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme Level 0 vouchers who can continue to use their medical fee waivers, there are over 11 200 patients benefitted from the enhanced medical fee waivers mechanism, including:


About 500 poor patients at A&Es,who were triaged as urgent, semi-urgent and non-urgent, received medical fee waivers, triple of last year's figure;
About 2 100 poor patients received medical fee waivers for inpatient services, 3.5 times of last year's figure; and
About 8 600 poor patients received medical fee waivers for specialist outpatient services, six times of last year's figure.


The HA spokesperson stated, ""The data concerned shows obviously that the enhanced medical fee waivers mechanism, which is newly introduced in line with the public healthcare fees and charges reform, can allocate resources more precisely to strengthen protection for poor, acute, serious and critical patients, ensuring that no patient is denied from medical care due to lack of means.""

The current situation regarding patients' applications and usage of medical fee waivers aligns with the HA's projection. The HA will continue to strengthen its manpower to provide assistance to patients in need. To ensure the integrity of the medical fee assistance system and prevent abuse, the HA will conduct regular reviews of approved cases.

Number of non-urgent A&E patients reduced significantly while treatment efficiency for emergency patients improved

Regarding A&E services, from January 1 to 7, 32 147 patients attended the 18 A&Es under the HA, significantly decreased by about 11.9 per cent of the same period last year. Among the cases, 1 807 patients were classified as critical and emergency cases, and 14 077 patients were classified as urgent cases, showing a slight increase compared to the same period last year. The remaining 16 263 patients were classified as semi-urgent and non-urgent cases, showing a significant decrease of 17.8 per cent compared to the same period last year. Since the implementation of the public healthcare fees and charges reform, the operations of public hospital A&E services has initially met expected results, including:


Significant decrease in average daily A&E attendances by about 11.9 per cent;
In the past seven days, about 1 800 critical and emergency patients exempted from A&E fees under the new fees and charges reform. These patients were required to pay the fees before the reform;
For patients classified as urgent cases, the percentage of those being treated within 30 minutes - meeting the service pledge target - increased from 82.7per cent last year to 88.8 per cent, with average waiting time reduced from 22 to 19 minutes; and
Among the five triage categories, semi-urgent and non-urgent cases decreased by about 17.8per cent compared to last year.


The HA spokesperson said, ""The service data of the past week shows that the fees and charges reform allowed A&Es to perform their emergency care function more effectively. A&Es can better concentrate resources, treat patients with urgent medical needs more effectively, and improve treatment efficiency for urgent cases.""

The HA will continue to closely monitor the fees and charges reform as well as the overall operations of services of public hospitals, in order to ensure achieving the aim of protecting poor, acute, serious or critical patients."

​行政長官在大灣區（南沙）工商界高峰論壇及交流會2026致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2026-01-09 19:30,2026-01-09 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900267.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（一月九日）在大灣區（南沙）工商界高峰論壇及交流會2026的視像致辭：

各位來自粵港澳大灣區的政商界領袖、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

今天是粵港澳大灣區工商界的年度盛事——大灣區工商界高峰論壇及交流會舉辦的日子。活動今年在廣州南沙舉行，以「凝聚香港國際優勢助力灣區內聯外通」為主題，匯聚粵港澳工商界的代表共商發展。首先，我熱烈祝賀大灣區（南沙）工商界高峰論壇及交流會順利舉行。

二十屆四中全會對「十五五」時期國家經濟社會發展作出戰略擘畫，指出要增強區域發展協調性，鞏固提升粵港澳大灣區高質量發展動力源作用。廣州南沙是國家「十四五」規劃下的大灣區重大合作平台，香港是國際金融、航運、貿易中心，正全力建設國際創新科技中心，打造國際高端人才集聚高地。在「十五五」時期，香港將繼續積極通過南沙等合作平台，深度參與粵港澳大灣區建設，更好融入和服務國家發展大局。

二○二二年六月，國務院印發《廣州南沙深化面向世界的粵港澳全面合作總體方案》（《南沙方案》），為南沙擘劃重點發展方向。去年，《南沙方案》迎來第一階段發展目標的收官之年，建設成果豐碩。南沙的高新技術企業數量，已超過1 300家，國際高端人才年均增長百分之55。南沙的大灣區合作成效顯著，已有19個粵港澳聯合科技攻關項目加快推進。香港科技大學（廣州）在二○二二年正式開學，更已經有32個創新項目入駐大學的科創成果轉移轉化基地。

環顧全球，世界百年變局加速演進，地緣政治動蕩加劇，國際形勢複雜多變。國家實施高水平雙向對外開放戰略，鼓勵內地企業善用產能，助力不同地區的經濟和社會發展。二○二四年，國家對外直接投資超過1 900億美元，年增長超過百分之8。其中，國家對東盟的投資增長接近四成、對共建「一帶一路」國家投資的增長超過兩成，反映內地企業出海的勢頭正在加速。

內地企業出海的進程中，需要大量資金和專業服務的支持，也需要國際化的商業平台，讓產品及技術與國際接軌，更有效對接海外市場的需求。為更好服務企業出海，我在《施政報告》提出設立一站式平台內地企業出海專班，主動招攬計劃拓展海外業務的企業，通過香港為平台出海。

在「一國兩制」下，香港擁有內聯外通的優勢。香港是國家唯一的普通法司法管轄區，法律制度與全球多個金融中心接軌。同時，香港實行簡單低稅制，擁有高度開放和國際化的營商環境。我們積極推動數字貿易、金融服務、法律服務等領域的創新，為大灣區發展提供多元化、高增值、全方位的專業服務。

我們會繼續發揮香港「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，為內地企業提供籌融資服務，以至設立國際業務總部、財資中心、科研中心、供應鏈管理中心等，攜手企業一同走向世界。

長風破浪會有時，直掛雲帆濟滄海。工商界是大灣區建設的重要力量，是兩地合作的參與者與受益者。我相信各位會善用今天的活動，繼續深化交流，在科技創新、現代服務等領域，發掘更多合作商機。我期待香港企業充分發揮國際視野與資源網絡，與內地企業共同「走出去」，對接全球市場，為國家高水平對外開放貢獻更大力量。

最後，我祝願在座各位在新一年四季平安、大展鴻圖。謝謝大家。"
公營醫療收費改革　保障貧急重危病人　減免人數已達往年全年3.5倍,2026-01-09 19:23,2026-01-09 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900429.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）發言人今日（一月九日）公布，除改革前後均受惠於醫療費用豁免的60萬人（即綜援受助人、75歲或以上長者生活津貼受助人及長者院舍照顧服務券計劃級別0院舍券持有人）外，截至一月七日，醫管局已批出49 310宗醫療費用減免申請，達往年每年約14 000名病人獲批減免的3.5倍，顯示優化醫療費用減免機制大幅加強支援低收入家庭及弱勢社群。過去一周，不少病人受惠於優化後的減免機制，即時在使用急症室、門診及住院服務時獲得費用減免。

醫療費用減免生效逾萬貧困病人受惠

作為公營醫療收費改革的重要部分，醫管局同時擴大了醫療費用減免機制，令合資格低收入人士由過往約30萬大幅增加至約140萬，是過去受惠人數約4.6倍，確保有限的醫療資源可更精準投放幫助最有需要的貧、急、重、危病人。截至一月七日，醫管局批出的49 310宗減免申請中，包括32 249宗已完成評核及批出減免證明書的個案，最長可獲18個月的正式醫療費用減免；對於聲稱符合減免資格，但未能提交證明文件進行經濟審查的病人，醫管局亦彈性處理批出了17 061宗「有條件減免」申請，以便病人可以即時獲得醫療費用減免，但病人必須在三個月內提交相關文件作審查。

收費改革後，不少病人更首次受惠於擴大醫療費用減免機制，從以往繳付全費改為免費。由一月一日至七日期間，撇除改革前後均受惠於醫療費用減免的人士（即綜援受助人、75歲或以上長者生活津貼受助人及長者院舍照顧服務券計劃級別0院舍券持有人），已經有超過11 200名病人受惠於優化後的減免機制，其中包括︰


約500名獲分流為緊急、次緊急及非緊急的貧困病人獲得急症室費用減免，是去年同期約3倍；
約2 100名貧困病人獲得住院費用減免，是去年同期約3.5倍；及
約8 600名貧困病人獲得專科門診費用減免，是去年同期約6倍。

 
醫管局發言人說︰「有關數據清楚顯示，配合公營醫療收費改革新引入的擴大醫療費用減免機制，能夠更精準有效投放資源，令更多貧、急、重、危病人受保障，確保不會有病人因為經濟原因而未能接受醫療服務。」

現時病人申請及使用醫療費用減免的情況，與醫管局預計的情況相若，醫管局會繼續加強人手為有需要的病人提供協助，為了確保醫療費用援助制度健全及防止被濫用，醫管局會定期隨機抽查已批核的個案。

急症室非緊急病人顯著減少緊急病人治療效率提升

在急症室服務方面，由一月一日至七日，共有32 147名病人前往醫管局轄下18間急症室就診，較去年同期顯著減少11.9%，其中1 807名病人分流類別為危殆及危急、14 077名病人為緊急，較去年同期微升，餘下16 263名病人為次緊急及非緊急，較去年同期大減17.8%。自從公營醫療收費改革實施以來，對公立醫院急症室服務的運作亦初見成效，其中包括︰


急症室每日平均求診人次顯著減少約11.9%；
過去七日，約1 800名分流類別為危殆及危急的病人在新收費機制下獲豁免急症室收費。而在收費改革前，此類病人需要繳費；
分流類別為緊急的病人於30分鐘內就診，達致服務承諾指標的比率由去年82.7%增加至88.8%，而平均等候時間亦由22分鐘縮短至19分鐘；及
五類分流類別中，次緊急及非緊急病人佔比由去年同期54.2%減少至50.6%。


醫管局發言人說︰「過去一星期的服務數據顯示，收費改革令急症室能夠更有效發揮救急扶危的功能。急症室可以更集中資源及更有效治療有緊急醫療需要的病人，緊急病人的治療效率亦得以提升。」

醫管局會繼續密切監察公營醫療收費改革以及醫院服務的整體運作情況，確保達到保障貧、急、重、危病人的宗旨。"
反非法勞工行動拘十六人（附圖）,2026-01-09 18:27,2026-01-09 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900618.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於一月二日至昨日（一月八日）在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，包括「促進行動」、「曙光行動」以及聯同食物環境衛生署及康樂及文化事務署執行的「驚愕行動」。行動中共拘捕十二名懷疑非法勞工、三名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及一名涉嫌協助及教唆者。

反非法勞工行動中，入境處調查人員搜查了多個目標地點，包括食肆、貨倉及髮型屋等，共拘捕十二名懷疑非法勞工。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為四男八女，年齡介乎二十九至七十歲，當中兩名女子持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」），另有三名女子涉嫌行使及管有他人身份證。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為兩男一女，年齡介乎三十至六十四歲。此外，被捕的涉嫌協助及教唆者為一名六十二歲女子。有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口及／或強迫勞動指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口及／或強迫勞動的元素。被識別的販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

16 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photo),2026-01-09 18:27,2026-01-09 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900624.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Contribute"", ""Twilight"" and a joint operation with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department codenamed ""Flabbergast"" from January 2 to yesterday (January 8). A total of 12 suspected illegal workers, three suspected employers and a suspected aider and abettor were arrested.

  During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers raided multiple target locations including restaurants, warehouses and hair salons etc. Twelve suspected illegal workers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised four men and eight women, aged 29 to 70. Among them, two women were holding recognizance forms which prohibit them from taking any employment. In addition, three women were suspected of using and being in possession of Hong Kong identity cards which relates to another person. Two men and one woman, aged 30 to 64, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested. Furthermore, the suspected aider and abettor arrested was a woman aged 62. An investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged identity card or a identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) and/or forced labour victims. When any TIP and/or forced labour indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP and/or forced labour elements. Identified TIP and/or forced labour victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP and/or forced labour victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."

FSD introduces new measures to enhance fire service installations management and information transparency,2026-01-09 18:15,2026-01-09 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900602.htm,"  The Fire Services Department (FSD) yesterday (January 8) issued two circular letters to regulate registered fire service installation contractors (RFSIC) in further enhancing the management of fire service installations and equipment (FSI) and increasing transparency of information related to the operational status of FSIs. With the new measures in place, occupants and property management staff can have a better understanding of the operational status of FSIs. The new regulations have become effective immediately.

  FSD Circular Letter No. 1/2026 stipulates that when there is any defect in FSIs such as hose reels and manual call points, RFSICs must affix a Damage Notice complying with standard requirements in a prominent position on the FSI to facilitate easy identification. Members of the public can therefore avoid using non-operable FSIs during emergencies. In addition, RFSICs are required to apply seals on the main power switches of FSI systems to prevent power from being turned off by mistake, and facilitate inspections by property management staff to identify the status of power supply and take necessary follow-up actions in a timely manner.

  FSD Circular Letter No. 2/2026 reminds RFSICs that before turning off any FSIs for works, pre-assessment should be conducted on whether functions of other FSIs will be affected. All areas being affected should be reported concurrently to the FSD. RFSICs must put up large-sized notices at prominent locations such as main building entrances and lift lobbies, clearly outlining information including dates of FSI operation suspension and areas being affected, to keep occupants, property management staff, and other relevant parties informed. Occupants will therefore be reminded to raise awareness of fire safety when the FSIs are not in working order or being shut down.

  The FSD emphasises that RFSICs must strictly adhere to the new requirements. Any misconduct or negligence may result in disciplinary actions by the FSD, including being removed from the register of RFSICs.

  The FSD has been committed to enhancing building fire safety through regulation, inspection, and public education. It will continue to review and enhance various fire safety measures.

  Details of the two circular letters are available on the FSD's website:

創新科技及工業局常任秘書長在南沙出席「大灣區（南沙）工商界高峰論壇及交流會2026」致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2026-01-09 18:11,2026-01-09 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900634.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局常任秘書長蔡傑銘今日（一月九日）在南沙出席「大灣區（南沙）工商界高峰論壇及交流會2026」的致辭：

岳陽副書記（廣州市南沙區委副書記、區長）、林世豪主席（香港工業總會主席）：

大家好，很榮幸有機會與在座各位工商界翹楚共聚一堂，見證香港及粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）其他城市在多方面的合作，分享香港推進新型工業化的最新進展，並探討如何利用香港優勢進一步加快灣區發展。

「十五五」規劃建議為國家及大灣區未來一段時間的發展指明了方向，進一步明確了香港在新時期的定位和功能，其中重要一點是建設國際創科中心，融入和服務國家發展大局。

當前國際政治經濟發展再次證明了國家倡導科技創新和產業創新、堅持發展製造業及實體經濟決策的前瞻性和正確性。本屆特區政府因地制宜發展新質生產力、推進香港新型工業化。過去三年推出並落實一系列政策措施，完善本地創科生態圈，在支持傳統製造業利用創科升級轉型，促進創科及新型工業化發展方面取得積極的進展。根據政府統計處的數據，二○二四年香港「製造及新型工業產業」的增加價值為822億港元，較前一年上升7%，約佔本地生產總值的2.64%，反映政府的政策措施已漸見成效。

「十五五」規劃建議強調擴大高水平對外開放，開創合作共贏新局面。香港需要發揮高度國際化及內聯外通的優勢，作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」，與內地攜手打拼。創新科技及工業局自二○二三年起，已扶植近500家具潛力或引領性的創科企業有意在港發展、落戶或擴展業務，涵蓋生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人，以及先進製造與新能源科技等策略性產業。我們一直鼓勵這些企業與本地企業攜手合作，並善用特區政府不同的支援計劃，在這裏建立研發、中試與生產基地，利用香港製造的品牌優勢，將產品與服務推向全球市場。就此，我們最近已放寬推進創科產業落地發展的100億元「新型工業加速計劃」申請門檻，將項目總成本最低要求由3億港元調低至1.5億港元，以支持更多智能生產設施的建設。

此外，政府推動成立的香港新型工業發展聯盟匯聚資源構建「政、產、學、研、投」合作平台。同時，我們革新投資創科產業的思維，正籌備設立100億港元「創科產業引導基金」並計劃於二○二六至二七年度啓動，加強引導市場資金投資指定策略性新興和未來產業，建立具有香港優勢的創科產業鏈。這些措施都旨在推動香港創科生態圈發展，從而更好地支持包括大灣區在內的不同地區企業實現發展目標。

各位，李強總理於本月初在廣東調研期間表示，邁入新的一年，要緊緊圍繞推動高質量發展這個主題，牢記在全國發展大局中的使命，厚植創新發展優勢，奮力實現「十五五」良好開局。香港特區政府正積極推展各方面工作，包括已於去年十二月就香港新型工業中長期發展展開研究，探討如何主動對接「十五五」，融入國家新型工業化整體布局，在構建現代化產業體系中發揮獨特作用，服務國家高質量發展。

「深圳─香港─廣州」去年榮登全球創新集群之首，這充分説明灣區的巨大潛力和無限前景。新的歷史時期，香港將進一步發揮好「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的獨特優勢，以及「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台角色，與灣區各夥伴城市加強創科聯動、優勢互補，共同為實現國家的科技自立自強、引領發展新質生產力、構建高質量科技產業體系貢獻力量。

祝今天的活動圓滿成功，亦祝大家在二○二六年生意一帆風順，國家發展蒸蒸日上。謝謝！"

登革熱
———

​由一月二日至昨日（一月八日），中心錄得兩宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期分別到過菲律賓及越南。

截至昨日，今年錄得兩宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。二○二五年共錄得59宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。世衞二○二四年錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。由二○二五年一月至七月，全球97個國家／地區呈報了超過400萬宗登革熱個案及超過3 000宗相關死亡個案。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點亦普遍流行，印度尼西亞、印度和越南去年（二○二五年）已分別錄得超過100 000宗個案，馬來西亞和泰國亦分別錄得超過40 000宗個案，新加坡則錄得超過4 000宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省二○二五年共錄得超過3 500宗本地感染病例，去年十二月二十二日至二十八日的一周內錄得一宗於汕頭的病例。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, dengue fever and chikungunya fever",2026-01-09 17:30,2026-01-09 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900554.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 9) reported the latest situation of dengue fever (DF) and chikungunya fever (CF). The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, reminds the public that temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions (including neighbouring Southeast Asian countries) remain favourable for mosquito breeding. When travelling to areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, the public should take measures to prevent mosquito bites, including wearing loose, light-coloured, long-sleeved tops and trousers and applying insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or exposed parts of the body.

Dengue fever
----------------

  From January 2 to yesterday (January 8), the CHP recorded two imported DF cases. The patients had travelled to the Philippines and Vietnam respectively during the incubation period.

  As of yesterday, two imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 59 imported cases of DF were recorded in 2025.

  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. From January to July 2025, over four million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths have been reported in 97 countries/territories.

  DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India and Vietnam have each recorded over 100 000 cases in 2025; Malaysia and Thailand have each recorded over 40 000 cases; and Singapore has also recorded over 4 000 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded over 3 500 locally infected cases in 2025. One local case was recorded in a week between December 22 and 28, 2025, in Shantou.

  Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHP'swebsite.

Chikungunya fever
-----------------------

  As of 5pm today, no new cases of CF had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
------------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​​​​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water.

Grading of beach water quality released,2026-01-09 16:00,2026-01-09 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900484.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (January 9) released the latest grading of water quality for six gazetted beaches that are open all year round for swimming.

  Four beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1), and two as Fair (Grade 2).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Golden Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Silverstrand Beach




Grade 2 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Lido Beach




  Compared with the grading released last week, there was no change in the grading for these beaches.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666.

政府歡迎法改會發表關於電腦網絡罪行的報告書,2026-01-09 14:45,2026-01-09 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900226.htm,"​保安局發言人今日（一月九日）表示，政府歡迎法律改革委員會（法改會）轄下電腦網絡罪行小組委員會發表《依賴電腦網絡的罪行及司法管轄權事宜》報告書，進一步完善現行相關法例，以應對資訊科技發展對社會治安帶來的挑戰。

為應對資訊科技、電腦和互聯網方面迅速發展對保障個人權利所帶來的挑戰，以及其被利用來從事犯罪活動的潛在可能，報告書建議引入一項全新特定法例，以涵蓋五類依賴電腦網絡的罪行，分別為：非法取覽程式或數據、非法截取電腦數據、非法干擾電腦數據、非法干擾電腦系統，以及提供用作干犯電腦網絡相關罪行的器材、程式或數據（或為提供該器材、程式或數據而管有它）。

發言人指，報告書的建議能進一步完善現行處理依賴電腦網絡罪行的相關法例（如《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）及《電訊條例》（第106章）中的部分罪行），有助提升打擊此等犯罪行為的效能。政府將就報告書的有關建議展開仔細研究，考慮如何跟進落實。

同時，考慮到報告書屬於法改會有關電腦網絡罪行研究的第一部分，小組委員會亦正就其他網絡罪行範疇，包括「借助電腦網絡的罪行」和「證據事宜及執法程序事宜」進行研究，政府將全面審慎研究相關內容，以期制訂更完備的法律以應對資訊科技發展對社會治安帶來的挑戰。"
Government welcomes publication of report on Cyber-dependent Crimes by LRC,2026-01-09 14:45,2026-01-09 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900225.htm,"​A spokesperson for the Security Bureau said today (January 9) that the Government welcomed the publication of the Report on Cyber-Dependent Crimes and Jurisdictional Issues by the Cybercrime Sub-committee of the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong (LRC). The report seeks to further improve the existing legislation to meet the challenges to public order arising from advancements in information technology.

In order to address the challenges posed by the rapid development of information technology, computers and the Internet to the protection of individual rights, as well as the potential for such technologies to be exploited for criminal purposes, the report recommends the introduction of a new piece of tailored legislation on cybercrime to cover five types of cyber-dependent crimes: illegal access to program or data, illegal interception of computer data, illegal interference with computer data, illegal interference with computer system, and making available a device, program or data for committing a cyber-related crime (or possessing such device, program or data for the purpose of making it available).

The spokesperson added that the recommendations would further refine existing legislation addressing cyber-dependant crimes (such as certain offences under the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) and the Telecommunications Ordinance (Cap 106)), thereby enhancing the effectiveness of combating such criminal activities. The Government will conduct a thorough study of the recommendations and consider how to follow up and implement.

In recognition of the fact that the LRC's report represents the first part of the study on cybercrime, and that the Sub‑Committee is concurrently conducting research into other aspects relating to cybercrime, including cyber-enabled crimes, evidentiary and enforcement issues, the Government will study the relevant contents carefully and thoroughly, aiming to formulate more comprehensive legislation to address the challenges to public order arising from advancements in information technology."

FarmFest 2026 opens at Fa Hui Park in Mong Kok,2026-01-09 14:38,2026-01-09 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010800691.htm,"FarmFest 2026 runs for three consecutive days from today (January 9) to January 11 at Fa Hui Park in Mong Kok to showcase a variety of local agricultural and fisheries products and other goods.

Jointly organised by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), the Vegetable Marketing Organization and the Fish Marketing Organization (FMO), FarmFest is the largest outdoor farmers' market in Hong Kong, where local producers can directly sell their products to consumers. Marking its 20th anniversary this year, FarmFest houses over 430 stalls, among which over 220 are selling local agricultural and fisheries products. There are also stalls selling local delicacies, organic and healthy food, and household goods.

An array of specialty agricultural and fisheries products is on sale during FarmFest, featuring premium agricultural products produced by local organic, hydroponic and accredited farms, including kale, carrots, snap beans and hydroponic cherry tomatoes. Local fresh fisheries products cultured by local accredited fish farms, such as speckled blue groupers, gilthead seabream, tilapia and Pacific white shrimp are also available. Additionally, a variety of new products developed through collaboration and research with the industry, academia, the AFCD and the FMO (including reservoir mud carp siu mai, reservoir fish soup, fish luncheon meat, black croaker fish balls and black croaker spring rolls), will also be available for sale at the event.

The AFCD has been committed to promoting sustainable development of the agricultural and fisheries industries. To deepen the public's understanding of the latest developments in these local sectors, FarmFest features agricultural, fisheries, and joint fisheries and agricultural exhibition zones to showcase the industry's latest developments and how technology enhances productivity while fostering industry diversification to expand the added value of the products, thereby strengthening the industry's competitiveness. Additionally, a stamp collection game is available in the exhibition zones, offering shopping discounts to participants who collect designated stamps.

The agricultural zone showcases various cultivation technologies and modern farming machinery, allowing the public to understand how modern technologies help save manpower, time and manual labour, thereby enhancing farming efficiency. In respect of hydroponic cultivation technology, the zone features an in-house designed Vertical Aeroponic Cultivation System. This soilless cultivation system integrates smart monitoring technology and multilayer planting design, directly spraying misted nutrient solutions onto the roots of the crops to supply the necessary nutrients, making it particularly suitable for the commercial cultivation of rhizome crops. The zone also displays a smart farm model, showcasing a smart greenhouse and a tractor model, demonstrating how Internet of Things technology (IoT) can be used to monitor and control environmental conditions of the greenhouse in real time, while mechanisation reduces manpower and boost productivity. AFCD staff will provide demonstrations and guide services to introduce the technologies and allow the public to experience operations. A large modern tractor is also on display for the public to gain a further understanding.

The fisheries zone exhibits new aquaculture technologies leading the industry towards modernisation and sustainable development. The public can experience the AFCD's modern mariculture demonstration farm at Tung Lung Chau through virtual reality technology, learning the advantages of semi-submersible steel truss deep sea cages over traditional wooden fish rafts. The zone also displays a container eco-culture system model and exhibition panels to illustrate the operation workflows and its ecological benefits. The public can also operate a drone personally to experience modern water sampling methods and use a microscope to examine phytoplankton in the water samples.

The joint fisheries and agricultural zone introduces the developments of leisure farming and fisheries, including the ""Agri enJoy"" Scheme and ""Fish enJoy"" Scheme, related tourism route information as well as the new unified brand for local agricultural and fisheries products to be launched this year, which provides safe, low-carbon and quality local agricultural and fisheries products, along with its certification and traceability systems. The zone offers agricultural and fisheries workshops such as plant dyeing, organic herb planting and pearl extraction, with participants receiving the finished products as souvenirs. In addition, a 3D photo backdrop with agriculture and fisheries themes with an instant photo service is available for the public to capture memories.

FarmFest also features music and cultural performances as well as cooking demonstrations. Admission is free. The event is open from 10am to 8pm, and a free shuttle bus service is available to and from Shek Kip Mei MTR Station Exit C.

The AFCD, in collaboration with Radio Television Hong Kong, has produced a series of short videos featuring local agricultural and fisheries products.

LRC issues report on Cyber-Dependent Crimes and Jurisdictional Issues (with photo/video),2026-01-09 14:30,2026-01-09 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900205.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Law Reform Commission:

The Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong (LRC) today (January 9) published a report on Cyber-Dependent Crimes and Jurisdictional Issues, recommending the introduction of a new piece of bespoke legislation on cybercrime to cover five types of cyber-dependent crimes, i.e. crimes that can be committed only through the use of information and communications technology devices, where such devices are both the tool for committing the crimes and the target of the crimes. The report represents the first part of the LRC's study on cybercrime on which the LRC's Cybercrime Sub-committee issued a consultation paper in July 2022.

The five cyber-dependent crimes are illegal access to program or data, illegal interception of computer data, illegal interference with computer data, illegal interference with computer system, and making available a device, program or data for committing a cyber-related crime (or possessing such device, program or data for the purpose of making it available). The Sub-committee, chaired by Mr Derek Chan, SC, has studied the current laws in Hong Kong and the corresponding legislation in a number of other jurisdictions, namely Australia, Canada, England and Wales, the Chinese Mainland, New Zealand, Singapore and the United States of America.

At present, different computer-related offences are covered in the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) (CO) and the Telecommunications Ordinance (Cap 106) (TO), and some are outdated. This is unlike other jurisdictions mentioned above, which have all provided for the five cyber-dependent crimes and their related jurisdictional issues either by enacting bespoke cybercrime legislation or dedicating a part of their codified law to cybercrime.

The responses to the consultation paper have been taken into account by the LRC in formulating the final recommendations in the report. The LRC has further observed the guiding principles of balancing the rights of netizens and the interests of persons in the information technology industry against the need to protect the public's interest and right not to be disturbed or attacked when using or operating their computer system.

Some of the main final recommendations in the report are:

(i) Unauthorised access to program or data without lawful authority should be a summary offence (Access Offence). The defendant's knowledge that the access is unauthorised is one of the key mental elements of this offence. An aggravated form of the offence arises if the unauthorised access is accompanied by an intent to carry out further criminal activity. Apart from a general defence of reasonable excuse, specific defences are recommended to permit unauthorised access made for a range of specific purposes, including cybersecurity purposes, the protection of the interests of vulnerable persons (i.e. children under 16 and mentally incapacitated persons), as well as genuine educational, scientific and research purposes.

(ii) Unauthorised interception of computer data carried out for a dishonest or criminal purpose should be an offence. This offence would protect both private and non-private communications, and would apply to data generally, including metadata (i.e. information about a communication), data in transit and data momentarily at rest during transmission, and would therefore offer better protection to communications by members of the public than the existing section 27(b) of the TO, which is predicated on a telecommunications context. As ""for a dishonest or criminal purpose"" represents a high evidential threshold, it would not be necessary to provide any specific defence or exemption for professions or genuine businesses that intercept or use computer data in the ordinary course of their operation.

(iii) By transposing the existing provisions regarding ""misuse of a computer"" in sections 59(1A), 60 and 64(2) of the CO into the new cybercrime legislation, illegal interference with computer data and computer system should be offences (Interference Offences), subject to a general defence of reasonable excuse. Since access to program or data normally precedes interference with computer data or computer system, interference with computer data or computer systems for cybersecurity purposes should be a specific defence in addition to the two lawful excuses specified in the existing section 64(2) of the CO (which also apply to the Access Offence).

(iv) Knowingly making available a device, program or data (or a part thereof) for committing a cyber-related crime (or knowingly possessing such a device, program or data for the purpose of making it available) should be an offence. This offence would apply so long as the primary use of the device, program or data, determined objectively, is to commit a cyber-related offence, regardless of whether or not it can be used for any legitimate purposes. The aggravated form of the offence would occur if the perpetrator intends that the device, program or data be used (whether by himself or another person) to commit a cyber-related offence. To avoid over-criminalisation, a general defence of reasonable excuse and specific defences for cybersecurity, educational, scientific and research purposes are recommended. Further specific defences that cater to the operation of internet service providers, hosting service providers and automated technology are also available.

(v) In line with the international norm, Hong Kong law should provide for the extra-territorial application of the five proposed cyber-dependent offences. Hong Kong courts should have jurisdiction in a case where connections with Hong Kong exist. This includes cases where the perpetrator's act has caused or may cause serious damage to Hong Kong, or where the victim was physically present in Hong Kong at the time when the offence was committed.

(vi) As the severity of the harm caused by cybercrime has a wide range, each of the five proposed cyber-dependent offences has two maximum sentences in general, one applicable to summary convictions (two years' imprisonment) and the other to convictions on indictment (14 years' imprisonment). An exception is the aggravated form of the Interference Offences involving a danger to life (e.g. interference with a railway signal system). The proposed maximum penalty for it is life imprisonment, which is consistent with that of the aggravated offence of criminal damage already prescribed under the current CO.

The report and its executive summary can be accessed on the website of the LRC at www.hkreform.gov.hk. Hard copies are also available on request from the Secretariat of the LRC at 9/F, Champion Tower, 3 Garden Road, Central, Hong Kong."
法改會發表《依賴電腦網絡的罪行及司法管轄權事宜》報告書（附圖／短片）,2026-01-09 14:30,2026-01-09 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900203.htm,"下稿代法律改革委員會發出：

香港法律改革委員會（法改會）今日（一月九日）發表《依賴電腦網絡的罪行及司法管轄權事宜》報告書，建議引入一項全新針對電腦網絡罪行的特定法例，以涵蓋五類依賴電腦網絡的罪行，即只能通過使用資訊及通訊科技器材進行的罪行，當中有關器材既是犯罪工具，亦是犯罪目標。報告書屬於法改會有關電腦網絡罪行研究的第一部分，法改會電腦網絡罪行小組委員會已於二○二二年七月發表相關諮詢文件。

五類依賴電腦網絡的罪行為：非法取覽程式或數據、非法截取電腦數據、非法干擾電腦數據、非法干擾電腦系統，以及提供用作干犯電腦網絡相關罪行的器材、程式或數據（或為提供該器材、程式或數據而管有它）。由陳政龍資深大律師出任主席的小組委員會已研究香港的現行法律及多個其他司法管轄區，即澳大利亞、加拿大、英格蘭及威爾斯、中國內地、新西蘭、新加坡及美國的相應法例。

現時，不同的電腦相關罪行在《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）及《電訊條例》（第106章）中訂立，部分已不合時宜。這個情況與上述其他司法管轄區不同，該等司法管轄區全部均已制定針對電腦網絡罪行的特定法例，或透過其成文法典的專門部分處理電腦網絡罪行，藉此就該五類依賴電腦網絡的罪行及其相關司法管轄權事宜，訂定條文。

在制定報告書中的最終建議時，法改會已考慮對諮詢文件的回應意見。法改會亦繼續遵循指導原則，在兼顧網民的權利和資訊科技業內人士的權益，以及保障公眾在使用或操作電腦系統時免受騷擾或攻擊的權益和權利之間作出平衡。

報告書的部分主要最終建議如下：

（i）無合法權限而在未獲授權下取覽程式或數據，應定為簡易程序罪行（取覽罪）。被告人知悉取覽未獲授權是這項罪行的主要意念元素之一。如在未獲授權下取覽，並意圖進行其他犯罪活動，即屬加重罪行。除合理辯解可作為一般免責辯護外，亦建議設有特定的免責辯護，以容許在未獲授權下為多項特定目的取覽，這些目的包括網絡安全、保障易受傷害人士（即16歲以下兒童及精神上無行為能力的人）的利益，以及真正的教育、科學或研究目的。

（ii）為不誠實或犯罪目的而在未獲授權下截取電腦數據，應定為罪行。這項罪行同時保障私人通訊及非私人通訊，並適用於不同種類的數據，包括元數據（即關於通訊的資料）、傳送中的數據，以及在傳送期間暫時靜止的數據。因此，這項罪行能對公眾的通訊提供較《電訊條例》現有第27（b）條（該條的訂立建基於涉及電訊的預設處境）更有效的保障。鑑於「為不誠實或犯罪目的」的舉證門檻較高，無須為在通常運作過程中截取或使用電腦數據的專業或真實的業務，提供任何特定免責辯護或豁免。

（iii）藉着將《刑事罪行條例》第59（1A)、60及64（2）條關於「誤用電腦」的現有條文改列於新訂的電腦網絡罪行法例，非法干擾電腦數據及電腦系統應定為罪行（干擾罪），而合理辯解可作為一般免責辯護。由於取覽程式或數據通常於干擾電腦數據或電腦系統前發生，因此除了《刑事罪行條例》現有第64（2）條所指明的兩項合法辯解（它們亦同時適用於取覽罪）之外，為網絡安全目的而干擾電腦數據或電腦系統亦應定為特定免責辯護。

（iv）蓄意提供用作干犯電腦網絡相關罪行的器材、程式或數據或其部分（或蓄意為提供該器材、程式或數據而管有它），應定為罪行。只要有關器材、程式或數據主要用作（以客觀方式界定）干犯電腦網絡相關罪行，不論該器材、程式或數據是否亦可能用作任何合法目的，這項罪行也會適用。如犯罪者意圖將該器材、程式或數據用作（不論由其本人或他人）干犯電腦網絡相關罪行，即屬加重罪行。為避免過度刑事化，建議合理辯解可作為一般免責辯護，並為網絡安全、教育、科學及研究目的設有特定免責辯護。另設其他特定免責辯護，以顧及互聯網服務提供者、寄存服務提供者及自動化科技的運作。

（v）香港法律應與國際慣例保持一致，為五類建議的依賴電腦網絡的罪行訂定域外應用條文。凡是與香港有聯繫的案件，香港的法庭應具有司法管轄權。這包括案中犯罪者的作為已導致或可能導致對香港的嚴重損害，或案中受害人於相關罪行發生時身處香港。

（vi）由於電腦網絡罪行導致的傷害嚴重程度差別甚大，五類建議的依賴電腦網絡的罪行一般各自訂有兩項最高刑罰，一項適用於循簡易程序定罪（兩年監禁），另一項則適用於循公訴程序定罪（14年監禁）。涉及危害生命（例如干擾鐵路信號系統）的加重形式干擾罪則屬例外，其建議最高刑罰為終身監禁，與現行《刑事罪行條例》已就刑事損壞的加重罪行所訂立的刑罰保持貫徹一致。

收集宏福苑業主意願以推展長遠安置工作,2026-01-09 12:05,2026-01-09 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900317.htm,"政府發言人今日（一月九日）表示，正陸續透過社會福利署（社署）「一戶一社工」，主動接觸受火災影響的宏福苑業主，全面、有序地收集每戶業主就長遠安置方面的初步意願，以協助制定和落實具體方案。

行政長官早前指示應急住宿安排工作組，統籌各個相關政策局及部門，研究長遠安置方案，以情、理、法處理，以情先行，照顧居民的個別情況和意願，同時兼顧善用資源，協助受影響家庭重建家園。

發言人說：「社署社工一直與居民保持聯繫，聽取他們的意見，了解他們的實際情況和需要，提供所需協助。就長遠安置方面，我們留意到業主和社會有不同的想法，例如有希望政府收購業權；有希望讓宏福苑業主優先購買居者有其屋計劃單位；部分盼原區安置，部分則接受跨區安置；有建議原址重建，但同時亦有指所需等候時間太長等。」

「我們希望可以有系統地全面收集宏福苑業主的意見，進一步聽取和歸納他們的意願，例如在處理長遠住宿安排上，政府應考慮哪些重要原則，以及業主對不同長遠安置選項的初步意願等，作為政府下一步後續工作的參考。」

社署「一戶一社工」今日起會陸續聯絡宏福苑業主，收集他們對不同長遠安置安排的初步意願。目標是在本月中下旬取得業主的回應，進行分析。

發言人說：「工作組會小心歸納和研究業主的不同意願，並根據宏福苑的實際狀況，包括結構安全、技術可行性及社區規劃等因素作全面評估，盡早就長遠方案提出建議，供受影響業主考慮及選擇。」

他說：「政府與受影響業主的目標是一致的，都是希望盡早落實方案，盡快讓他們可以安心。」

火災發生後，政府在短時間內，為受影響宏福苑居民安排應急住宿。現時，逾4 400名居民入住包括酒店、青年宿舍／營舍、過渡性房屋、香港房屋協會項目或屯門寶田中轉房屋的單位。由去年十二月二十二日起，「大埔宏福苑援助基金」亦向每個宏福苑單位的業主分段發放為期兩年最多達30萬元的租金補助，讓他們在安排住宿上更具彈性及有更多選擇。"
Collecting preferences of Wang Fuk Court flat owners to advance long-term rehousing work,2026-01-09 12:05,2026-01-09 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900323.htm,"  A Government spokesman said today (January 9) that social workers under the ""one social worker per household"" service of the Social Welfare Department (SWD) are proactively contacting flat owners of Wang Fuk Court, who were affected by the fire. They are comprehensively and systematically gathering each owner's preliminary preferences regarding long-term rehousing to assist in formulating and implementing specific plans.

  The Chief Executive previously instructed the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements to co-ordinate relevant policy bureaux and departments in studying long-term rehousing solutions. Adhering to the principles of ""empathy, reason, and law"", with priority given to ""empathy"", the Task Force aims to address the individual circumstances and preferences of residents while ensuring the efficient use of resources to assist affected households in rebuilding their homes.

  The spokesman said, ""Social workers from the SWD have been in contact with the residents, listening to their views, understanding their actual situations and needs, and providing necessary assistance. Regarding long-term accommodation, we have noticed differing opinions among flat owners and the community. For example, some hope that the Government will acquire the properties or give priority to Wang Fuk Court flat owners to purchase Home Ownership Scheme flats. Some residents seek local rehousing, while others accept rehousing in different districts. Some propose in-situ redevelopment, but there are also concerns about the lengthy waiting times.

  ""We hope to systematically and comprehensively collect Wang Fuk Court flat owners' opinions, further listening to and summarising their preferences. This includes identifying key principles that the Government should consider when addressing long-term accommodation arrangements and noting the flat owners’ initial preferences for different long-term rehousing options. This information will serve as a reference for the Government's follow-up actions.""

  Starting today, social workers under the SWD's ""one social worker per household"" service will begin contacting flat owners of Wang Fuk Court to gather their initial preferences regarding various long-term rehousing arrangements. The goal is to collect responses from the flat owners by mid-to-late January for analysis.

  The spokesman said, ""The Task Force will carefully compile and study the different preferences of flat owners and will conduct a comprehensive assessment based on the actual conditions at Wang Fuk Court, including structural safety, technical feasibility, and community planning. We aim to provide affected flat owners with suggestions regarding long-term proposals as soon as possible for their consideration and decision-making.""

  He said, ""The Government and affected flat owners share a same objective: to implement solutions promptly and reassure them as soon as possible.""

  Following the fire, the Government arranged emergency accommodation for the affected residents of Wang Fuk Court in a short time frame. As of today, more than 4 400 residents are staying in hotels, youth hostels/camps, transitional housing, units from the Hong Kong Housing Society or Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun. Since December 22 last year, the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po has provided each flat owner, in tranches, with a two-year rental subsidy up to a maximum of $300,000, giving them more flexibility and options in their accommodation arrangements."

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-09 06:46,2026-01-09 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900133.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月九日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；

CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-09 06:46,2026-01-09 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900134.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 9) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

CEDD commended by Ombudsman on slope safety work,2026-01-08 23:22,2026-01-08 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800884.htm,"​Regarding the report on the direct investigation into the Government's work on landslide prevention and mitigation and management of government slopes released by the Office of the Ombudsman today (January 8), the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) welcomed the Office's high commendation and recognition of the department's efforts in implementing the Landslip Prevention and Mitigation Programme (LPMitP) and regulating slope safety. The CEDD accepts the Office's recommendations and will fully implement various initiatives while continuously reviewing their effectiveness. In response to the Office's recommendations, the CEDD will continue to strengthen its overall capability in responding to landslide risks in four areas, namely preparedness, early warning, emergency response and recovery, to keep enhancing slope safety.

On preparedness, applying a risk-based approach under the LPMitP, the CEDD systematically selects government man-made slopes for upgrading works and natural hillside catchments for mitigation measures annually. Starting from 2025, the CEDD has been progressively increasing the annual targets under the LPMitP and optimising the slope selection mechanism to strengthen resilience of slopes to heavy rain. The CEDD will review the LPMitP's targets and effectiveness in response to environmental changes, ensuring the LPMitP's continued efficacy.

The CEDD plans to fully roll out the Smart Slope Catalogue this year, integrating records of mitigation works, maintenance, rainfall endured, and landslides to expand comprehensive monitoring and data management related to slopes. By applying artificial intelligence for big data analysis, the catalogue will improve the functionality and efficiency of slope safety management, thereby better preparing for extreme weather.

On early warning, the CEDD will fully commission the AI Landslip Warning System in the wet season of this year. The system integrates Hong Kong's rainfall data and information in the Smart Slope Catalogue, and applies machine learning and big data analytics, to boost the accuracy of the predicted number of landslides during heavy rain, thereby enhancing the capability for landslide risk assessment and improving the reliability of the issuance of Landslip Warning.

On emergency response and recovery, the CEDD will stay abreast of the technological advancements in slope safety, and developing and introducing innovative technologies. This includes piloting applications of a smart unmanned drone management system on slope monitoring and emergency management to expand data collection and analytics capabilities. The CEDD will also continue to strengthen collaboration with relevant departments, such as sharing on common maintenance issues and assessment of the impact of heavy rain on slopes, with a view to enhancing slope safety and reducing landslide risk.

The Office noted that the landslide incident rate for government slopes is relatively higher and that there are cases of repeated occurrences. In fact, this is mainly related to the categorisation of slopes and their potential impact, reflecting the government's risk-based approach to slope management. The man-made slopes maintained by the government are distributed over an extensive area, possess diversified nature, and have different levels of risks. These include slopes with relatively high, medium, and relatively low potential impacts, categorised mainly by the risk of loss of life in the event of a landslide. To ensure public safety, the government will prioritise landslide prevention works on slopes that pose a higher potential impact. Some of the government slopes that fall into medium or relatively low potential impact categories may not be accorded priority because of their relatively remote locations or a lower risk of loss of life. As such, those government slopes with medium and relatively low potential impacts may also experience landslides under a risk-controlled condition. On the contrary, private man-made slopes are more similar in nature. Most of them are close to private residences and would pose greater impact on the residents in the event of a landslide. They are generally categorised as having relatively high potential impact and receive a higher level of attention. This explains why the overall landslide incident rate for government slopes appears higher, and why landslides may occur repeatedly on some individual slopes with medium or relatively low potential impacts.

In fact, between 2020 and 2024, the annual landslide incident rates for both government and private man-made slopes remained below one per cent (ranging from 0.1 per cent to 0.6 per cent for government slopes and 0.03 per cent to 0.3 per cent for private slopes), which is a very low level. Overall, an average of about 214 incidents were recorded annually over the past decade (2015 to 2024), representing a decrease of nearly one-third compared to the average of about 300 incidents between 1989 and 2014. This reflects the notable results achieved through the ongoing prevention and mitigation efforts.

In response to the landslide incidents triggered by the extreme rainstorm in September 2023, the CEDD has completed a systematic review and study, putting forward a number of recommendations to optimise the LPMitP. New measures include expediting the progress of LPMitP and prioritising, under a risk-based approach, the risk management of man-made slopes located along sole vehicular accesses and those with a greater potential impact on the public's daily lives. The CEDD thanks the Ombudsman for recognising in its report the department's timely review and adjustment of the direction of the LPMitP, acknowledging that such an approach is proactive and effective in adapting to changing circumstances.

The CEDD will continue to closely monitor slope safety in Hong Kong and remains committed to enhancing slope safety management through collaboration, driving Hong Kong's development as a resilient and livable world-class city."
Public healthcare fees and charges reform shows initial success Accident and Emergency Departments focus resources on critical care,2026-01-08 21:17,2026-01-08 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800783.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

​The Hospital Authority (HA) spokesperson announced today (January 8) that since the implementation of the public healthcare fees and charges reform one week ago, operations in Accident and Emergency Departments (A&Es) of public hospitals have been functioning smoothly. The overall number of attendances has decreased. A&Es have been able to concentrate resources to serve critical and emergency patients, ensuring timely treatment for all critical and emergency patients and improving the efficiency of patient care.

During the past week (from January 1 to 7), a total of 32 147 patients attended the 18 A&Es under the HA. Among them, 1 807 patients were triaged as critical or emergency cases, 14 077 as urgent cases, while the remaining 16 263 as semi-urgent or non-urgent cases.

During this period, the daily average A&E attendances was 4 592, which included an average of 258 critical or urgent cases (5.6 per cent), 2 011 emergency cases (43.8 per cent), and 2 323 semi-urgent or non-urgent patients (50.6 per cent). Compared to the full year of 2025, the daily average A&E attendances was 5 210, comprising 228 critical or emergency cases (4.4 per cent), 2 156 emergency cases (41.4 per cent), and 2 826 semi-urgent or non-urgent cases (54.2 per cent).

The HA spokesperson said, ""Over the past week, the number of A&E attendances and the proportion of patients of various triage categories at A&Es indicate that the public healthcare fees and charges reform has yielded initial results. Not only have the number and proportion of semi-urgent and non-urgent patients decreased, but all critical and emergency patients arriving at A&Es have been able to receive immediate treatment from healthcare staff. The vast majority of emergency patients received treatment within 15 minutes of arrival. Additionally, the proportion of urgent patients receiving treatment within 30 minutes has increased from 82.7 per cent last year to 88.8 per cent, while the average waiting time for urgent patients has decreased from 22 minutes to 19 minutes.""

Following the implementation of the public healthcare fees and charges reform, the HA has regularised the A&E refund arrangements, which can facilitate less urgent patients in opting to other healthcare institutions after triage. From January 1 to 7 this year, a total of 257 A&E patients applied for refund, compared to 691 patients during the same period in 2025. The spokesperson reiterated that A&E is positioned to serve critical, emergency and urgent patients. Individuals with minor conditions or episodic illnesses, such as common colds, are encouraged to visit Family Medicine Clinics, private doctors, or 24-hour outpatient services of private hospitals. This enables A&E to concentrate resources on treating patients with urgent medical needs.

Currently, all A&Es are operating smoothly. While a small number of semi-urgent and non-urgent patients might experience longer waiting time when A&Es were handling a large volume of critical cases at certain period, the majority of these patients were treated and discharged within a few hours. All patients requiring admission after treatment in A&E can be admitted within four hours, with no patient remaining in the A&E for extended periods awaiting admission.

The HA will continue to closely monitor the operations of A&E to ensure that resources are focused on patients with urgent medical needs, in line with the objectives of the public healthcare fees and charges reform to strengthen support for ""poor, acute, serious, critical"" patients."
