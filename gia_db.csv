å°æ¬çé­å©·å©·å¯é¨é· (Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance, Ms Guo Tingting), çæ¾èç§æ¸é· (Secretary-General of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Wang Songmiao), David (Chairman of the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council (AFRC), Dr David Sun), Janey (Chief Executive Officer of the AFRC, Ms Janey Lai), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. I am delighted to join the AFRC Regional Regulatory Forum. This second edition has brought together some 400 participants - regulators, industry leaders and academics - from across nine economies. To those who have travelled from abroad, a very warm welcome to Hong Kong. We treasure your participation, and look forward to meaningful exchanges of perspectives and regulatory collaboration.

  The theme of the forum today, ""Accounting for the Future"", carries a clever dual meaning: What lies ahead for the accounting profession? And how must the profession evolve to truly account for the future?

  We are living through a time of profound transformation in which the accounting profession is being reshaped. Technological advancement, especially artificial intelligence (AI), transforms the work and value of accountants. Meanwhile, the growing global focus on sustainability is expanding the remit of audit and assurance. How can we embrace AI and ensure the integrity of AI-assisted processes? And how can we ensure the relevance and credibility of sustainability reporting?

Hong Kong's path

  As an international financial and business centre, Hong Kong must be at the forefront of these developments. And a world-class financial hub must be built on the highest standards of professional integrity too. These are vital for capital to flow with confidence, for markets to function effectively, and for economic activity to flourish.

  For Hong Kong, there is an additional dimension amid today's evolving geoeconomic landscape. That is our role to connect China with the world and to serve as a two-way platform for capital and businesses. The recent Fourth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee laid out China's development roadmap under the upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan, reaffirming the country's commitment to high-level, two-way opening up. In essence, China is welcoming more investments and foreign businesses into the country, and at the same time, encouraging Mainland enterprises to go global to reconfigure their supply chain and industry chain, as well as deepen international industrial collaboration.

  Many of these Mainland enterprises are choosing to ""go global"" through Hong Kong. They are leveraging our full suite of financial and professional services, from trade finance, supply chain and treasury management, to cross-border tax advisory and ESG (environmental, social and governance) consulting. This growing momentum is reflected in our capital markets. Hong Kong currently leads the world in IPO (initial public offering) fund raising, and there are over 300 companies in the pipeline waiting to be listed on our Stock Exchange.

  In this context, Hong Kong is not just a ""super connector"" but also a ""super value-adder"". We play a vital bridging role, helping Mainland enterprises connect with international markets and converge Mainland standards with the global ones. Our professional services sector will help them navigate increasingly complex regulatory environments, and communicate with global investors and other stakeholders, for example in the areas of financial reporting, corporate governance and sustainability.

  Ladies and gentlemen, all these developments are placing higher expectations on our accounting and auditing professionals – demanding an unwavering commitment to the highest standards, uncompromising professional integrity, a heightened sense of social responsibility, and greater versatility in skills and expertise.

  I'm pleased to note that our industry and regulator are working together to advance the development of the profession. In Hong Kong, regulators are enablers of progress and innovation. As David eloquently illustrated with the ""chopsticks principle"", the AFRC has a dual mandate of prudent regulation and market development facilitation.

  Allow me to supplement two points. First, the philosophy of promoting regulation and development side by side is a core and unique strength of our regulation. Regulators are required to maintain close engagement with stakeholders, and address their challenges and pain points while staying alert to emerging growth opportunities.

  Second, about policy co-ordination. As you know, we do not adopt a single super-regulator approach. Each sector has its own regulator, for example, the HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) for the banks and the SFC (Securities and Futures Commission) for the securities brokers. But we have established a co-ordination mechanism that regularly brings regulators together to share market insights and intelligence, and to address cross-sectoral issues or emerging issues that may not readily fall onto the shoulder of a particular regulator. This mechanism ensures that our regulatory frameworks remain agile, forward-looking and responsive to market situations, and facilitate market innovation.

  On the global stage, when it comes to regulation, Hong Kong has always been at the forefront of international best practices. But we do more than just that - we also contribute. We take part in various international committees and contribute our perspectives and experiences in standard setting, education and capacity building. For example, in the area of sustainability reporting, the CEO of the SFC co-chairs the IOSCO (International Organization of Securities Commissions) Sustainable Finance Task Force’s Workstream on Corporate Reporting, which plays a pivotal role in the development and implementation of the ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board)disclosure standards.

Embracing the future: sustainability, AI and talent

  Looking ahead, the accounting profession in the region must rise to the challenges of today and tomorrow, and capture the opportunities arising. Three issues stand out: sustainability, technology and talent.

  First, sustainability. While the US (United States) is rolling back its climate commitments, many others - including China - are moving full steam ahead. In Hong Kong, we remain firmly committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, by a multipronged strategy: net-zero electricity generation, green buildings, green transport and waste reduction.

  And our accounting profession is making significant strides in advancing sustainability reporting. With the ISSB now setting a global baseline for corporate disclosure, Hong Kong is moving decisively in the same direction. In December last year, we launched Hong Kong's Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure, setting a clear path for large publicly accountable entities to fully adopt the ISSB standards by 2028. In June, the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation) recognised us as one of the first jurisdictions with a clear and credible roadmap.

  The AFRC's upcoming public consultation on a local sustainability assurance framework marks another important step forward.

  Second, technology, particularly AI. The Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government embraces AI and is driving its advancement through a twin-engine strategy: developing AI as a core industry, and promoting ""AI+"", i.e. AI as an enabler to upgrade and transform traditional sectors.

  The transformative power of AI is formidable. It brings tremendous potential, but at the same time, its use must be matched with a strong sense of responsibility. That's why we are building strong governance frameworks for the responsible adoption of AI.

  In financial services, we have issued a policy statement on the ethical use of AI. For the accounting profession in particular, the AFRC will assess the emerging opportunities and potential risks associated with the use of AI by audit firms. Guidance will be developed to enhance awareness and support AI deployment.

  Finally, talent. While the accounting profession is evolving rapidly, one truth remains unchanged - and has become even more vital: its future success depends on people.

  Like many jurisdictions around the world, Hong Kong faces a persistent shortage of accounting talent. To address this, the AFRC and HKICPA (Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants) are working closely with academic and professional institutions on a number of education and professional development initiatives. And as a stop-gap measure, we welcome talent from outside Hong Kong to join us. In March this year, we included accounting professionals in our Talent List to make it easier for qualified non-local accountants to come to work in Hong Kong.

  Over the longer term, we will continue to invest in building a vibrant future for the accounting profession, providing practitioners with continuous upskilling to further enhance their strategic and advisory capabilities. This will help them better seize the opportunities on the horizon.

  Fellow accountants and friends, just as crucial is work-life balance. Let's also work to cultivate a culture that supports sustainable, fulfilling career paths, making the profession more attractive and rewarding for the next generation.

Concluding remarks

  Ladies and gentlemen, in answering the questions for ""Accounting for the Future"", perhaps I can borrow a quote from Mahatma Gandhi: ""The future depends on what you do today.""

  Hong Kong stands ready to work with you all today - to shape that future together.

  I wish you a successful and inspiring Forum, and continued good health and business in the time ahead. Thank you."

165 Mainland higher education institutions to admit Hong Kong students,2025-11-10 11:00,2025-11-10 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/10/P2025111000231.htm,"âThe Education Bureau (EDB) welcomed the announcement by the Ministry of Education that the number of Mainland higher education institutions participating in the Scheme for Admission of Hong Kong Students to Mainland Higher Education Institutions (Admission Scheme) will increase to 165 (listed in the Annex) for the 2026/27 academic year. The institutions are located in 21 provinces/municipalities and two autonomous regions of the Mainland, and they will accept applications from candidates sitting the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Examination in 2026.

A spokesman for the EDB said today (November 10), ""The Mainland higher education institutions participating in the Admission Scheme admit Hong Kong students based on their HKDSE Examination results, hence exempting them from taking the Joint Entrance Examination for Mainland Institutions. The number of participating institutions for the 2026/27 academic year has increased significantly by 20 compared to last year, with institutions from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region joining for the first time. The 165 participating higher education institutions offer various programmes. We encourage Hong Kong students to pursue further studies on the Mainland through the Admission Scheme and seize the opportunity to learn about the country's latest social, economic and cultural landscape, and plan ahead for their future development. The EDB will continue discussions with the Mainland with a view to inviting more renowned Mainland institutions to participate in the Admission Scheme, and providing students with multiple study pathways and opportunities to connect with the country's development.

  ""As in previous years, there is the School Principal Nomination Scheme under the Admission Scheme, and each secondary school can nominate up to eight students. The minimum entrance requirement adopted by the participating Mainland institutions is 'Attained' in the Citizenship and Social Development subject and a total score of 8 or above in the three core subjects (i.e. Chinese Language, English Language and Mathematics) in the HKDSE Examination, and among them none is below 2.""

Students interested in participating in the Admission Scheme for the 2026/27 academic year can log on to the designated website to apply online from December 1 to 31, 2025, and subsequently review and confirm application verification results before January 10, 2026. As for cases in which students provided supplementary information as per the system's request, they can log on and review verification results before January 23, 2026. Those who have passed the application verification should pay the application fee (HK$460) by January 31, 2026, after which Mainland institutions participating in the Admission Scheme may arrange interviews based on the application information submitted by students. Institutions will announce admission results in late July 2026 and arrange for supplementary enrolment according to the enrolment situation.

Details of the Admission Scheme are available on the EDB's website (www.edb.gov.hk/admissionscheme). Students, teachers and parents can also participate in the Mainland Higher Education Expo 2026/27 jointly organised by the Office of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Affairs and the Department of College Students Affairs of the Ministry of Education, and the EDB on November 29 and 30 (Saturday and Sunday) at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. Details will be announced in due course.

In addition, eligible Hong Kong students enrolled in undergraduate programmes of designated Mainland institutions can apply for a means-tested subsidy or a non-means-tested subsidy under the Mainland University Study Subsidy Scheme (MUSSS). MUSSS is not subject to any quota. The subsidy is granted on a yearly basis, and the subsidised period is the normal duration of the undergraduate programme pursued by the student concerned in a designated Mainland institution. Eligible applicants may only receive either a means-tested subsidy or a non-means-tested subsidy in the same academic year."

Mr Yu (Deputy Chairman of Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC), Mr Emil Yu), Mohamed (Executive Director of HKPC, Mr Mohamed Butt), distinguished speakers and guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you today at the GBA International Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Summit 2025. This year's theme – ""Empowering Resilient Industries through Embodied AI"" captures the transformative potential of AI which drives innovation, bolsters industries, and spurs sustainable growth. This idea aptly aligns with our policy direction of promoting ""industries for AI"" and ""AI for industries"", underscoring the need for all sectors to adapt and thrive in an evolving AI landscape.

 Our country's support for Hong Kong to develop into an international innovation and technology centre is reaffirmed in the 15th Five-Year Plan just released. Hong Kong shall work closely with neighbouring cities to contribute to the high quality development of the Greater Bay Area and the country. In this connection, AI and robotics remain top of our agenda.

 The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government adopts a multi-pronged approach in fostering the development of AI, from enhancing R&D (research and development) capabilities, cultivating and attracting talents, to building infrastructure and promoting AI-related industry applications.

 In terms of R&D, the InnoHK Platform, our flagship initiative, brings together 16 laboratories and over a thousand leading experts to drive breakthroughs in robotics and enhance Hong Kong's AI capabilities. One of the centres made history with the world's first long-distance, robot-assisted magnetic endoscopy using an animal model performed in parallel in Hong Kong and Zurich, spanning across a distance of 9 300 kilometres. This is a remarkable breakthrough in remote diagnostic and surgical interventions, and opens new possibilities for distanced delivery of advanced medical care. We are exactly looking for more of these applications of AI and robotics that benefit humankind.

 We are also investing heavily in talent. The $3 billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme launched this September supports the eight universities funded by the University Grants Council to attract international top-notch researchers in frontier fields including AI to Hong Kong. The Talent List is also drawn up to attract high quality talents, including experienced AI specialists, to Hong Kong, reinforcing Hong Kong's position as a leading international talent hub, as reflected by Hong Kong's excellent performance in the recent QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) World University Ranking 2026 for Asia.

 On infrastructure, Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre will further ramp up its computing power to meet the increasing local demand. The Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute will be established in 2026 to link up upstream AI research, midstream transformation of R&D outcomes and downstream industry applications. Meanwhile, a site at Sandy Ridge of Northern Metropolis has also been put to tender in the market for development of a data facility cluster.We hope this will strengthen Hong Kong's position as a regional digital infrastructure hub, and advance the development of a digital economy and smart city initiatives.

 Before I close, I would like to share with you an encouraging news: in the IMD (International Institute for Management Development)'s World Digital Competitiveness Ranking released last week, Hong Kong moves to the fourth place globally, up from seventh last year. I hope events that pool together experts in the field – such as today's Summit – will continue to inspire us to innovate, collaborate, and lead with purpose. And as we build a smarter and brighter future together, I encourage all registered voters here to cast your vote in the Legislative Council election on December 7 to shape a better future for Hong Kong. Thank you."

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 59 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, three were local cases and the rest were imported cases.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, the recent outbreak of CF has shown a sustained downward trend. There were 107 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (November 2 to 8), showing a significant decrease compared to the previous week (October 26 to November 1), which reported 259 cases. The cases last week were mainly reported in Shenzhen (30 cases), Jiangmen (23 cases), Foshan (21 cases) and Zhuhai (10 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  In light of the recent recording of a locally acquired case in Kwai Tsing District, the CHP conducted a risk assessment and collaborated with relevant District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention to over 10 000 households in Mount Haven and the surrounding areas, Kwai Chung Plaza, Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan and the vicinity to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

  From November 3 to 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 13 000 individuals residing or working in higher-risk districts through health consultation booths, along with its inquiry hotline, door-to-door visits and questionnaire surveys conducted in the districts concerned. The CHP has arranged blood tests for a total of 14 persons who had mild symptoms and all were tested negative. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past one day. The health consultation booths located at Cheung Hang Community Hall in Tsing Yi and Kwai Fong Estate (near Kwai Ming House) will continue to provide assessments for the citizens in the districts daily from 9am to 1pm. The previously established inquiry hotline (2125 2373) will also continue to operate daily from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


   The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

   Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.
