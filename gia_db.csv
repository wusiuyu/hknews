The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) today (November 26) hosted the second Joint Climate Finance Conference. The hybrid conference, which took place in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, brought together nearly 250 participants across both regions.

As the flagship initiative of the DFSA-HKMA partnership to support and enable climate finance in the Middle East and Asia, this year's conference focused on financial risks arising from climate change and innovation. It featured a series of dynamic discussions on how the two regions can leverage their strengths in finance and technology to collaborate on the development and deployment of innovative products and solutions, to facilitate energy transition and other sustainable development goals of the region and beyond.

The conference also provided a deep dive into the findings of the DFSA-HKMA joint research ""Scaling Sustainable Debt in Emerging Markets"", developed with knowledge partner BloombergNEF, on the role of sustainable debt in scaling up climate finance in emerging markets.

Supported by strategic partners including Dubai International Financial Centre Authority, Nasdaq Dubai, and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the conference featured distinguished speakers in business, commerce, and financial services from across the Asia Pacific and Middle East and North Africa regions. Their participation underscores the event's role as a premier platform for cross-industry dialogue, knowledge sharing, and collaboration on initiatives that drive long-term value and responsible investment in the region.

The Chief Executive of the DFSA, Mr Mark Steward,said, ""By combining our strengths as international financial centres, we are creating new pathways for sustainable investment and innovation. Tokenisation and other emerging technologies, which have been discussed in detail today, have the potential to make climate finance more transparent, efficient, and globally accessible - accelerating the transition across the Asia-Middle East corridor.""

Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMAMr Darryl Chansaid, ""Dubai and Hong Kong are in a unique position to facilitate climate action across Asia and the Middle East, enabling economies in the region to capture the growth opportunities created by technology advancement in green sectors. With the window for decisive action narrowing, we must move fast to bridge the gaps between markets, between capital and projects, and between ambition and execution. The HKMA and the DFSA will continue to provide a platform for the much-needed dialogue and collaboration.""

The spokesman said that the CFS has informed the stall concerned of the irregularity and instructed it to stop sales of the affected product. The CFS is also tracing the source and distribution of the product concerned.

Malachite green is a type of industrial dye and has been used for treating infections in fish. Currently, malachite green has been prohibited for use in food-producing animals in many countries.

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-26 20:03,2025-11-26 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/26/P2025112600719.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 26), the CHP has recorded one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
-----------------------------
 The case involves a 69-year-old male living in Eastern District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Chaozhou and Shantou in Guangdong alone on November 17. He developed a fever and joint pain on the day he returned to Hong Kong on November 22, followed by rash today. He sought medical attention at Chai Wan Family Medicine Clinic yesterday (November 25), and is being arranged to admit to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. His blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient has one household contact, who is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

ã Since the patient stayed in the Chinese Mainland during his incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case is classified as imported. The CHP will report the case to the relevant health authorities in the Chinese Mainland.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 72 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

 Among the recently recorded imported cases, five reside in Tsing Yi. The CHP's epidemiological investigation revealed that their activities during the incubation and infectious periods overlapped in Tsing Yi North, primarily around Tsing Yi town centre and the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. The CHP has notified the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of the locations visited by the five patients for mosquito control operations. The CHP is also performing genomic sequencing and analysis on patient samples, comparing them with other local and imported cases, to determine whether these cases are linked. As some confirmed cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considers the trails to be a higher-risk area. As a precautionary measure, the CHP urged individuals who have hiked in the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area since November 1 to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the CHP's enquiry hotline (2125 2373). The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. The CHP will assess symptomatic individuals and arrange blood tests if necessary. The CHP has not received any enquiries from symptomatic individuals over the past three days. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

  A 31-year-old male passenger arrived in Hong Kong in transit from Bangkok, Thailand, to London, the United Kingdom, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds inside his check-in suitcase. The man was subsequently arrested.

  The arrested man has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, and he will appear at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (November 27).

  Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

  Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

  Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

  Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-26 19:45,2025-11-26 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/26/P2025112600700.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月二十六日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————
個案涉及一名69歲男子，居於東區。初步調查顯示，他於十一月十七日獨自到訪廣東省潮州市及汕頭市，在十一月二十二日回港當天出現發燒和關節痛，今日出現皮疹。他昨日（十一月二十五日）到柴灣家庭醫學診所求醫，正獲安排到東區尤德夫人那打素醫院醫院留醫，在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。他有一名家居接觸者，該名家居接觸者暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人在潛伏期曾到訪中國內地，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，會把個案通報中國內地的衞生當局。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得72宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

近期錄得的輸入個案中，有五名患者居於青衣。中心的流行病學調查顯示，他們在潛伏期及發病後在青衣北活動的範圍有重疊，主要包括青衣市中心一帶及青衣自然徑附近。中心已把個案活動的地點通知食物環境衞生署（食環署），進行控蚊滅蚊行動。中心亦正就病人樣本進行基因排序及分析，並對比其他本地及輸入個案，以確定他們之間是否有關聯。由於部分確診個案報稱，在青衣自然徑行山期間曾被蚊叮咬，中心認為青衣自然徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心呼籲自十一月一日起曾在青衣自然徑一帶行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，盡快求醫，並致電中心早前設立的查詢熱線（2125 2373），熱線每日由上午九時至下午八時運作。中心會為出現病徵人士進行評估，如有需要，會安排抽血化驗，而過去三天中心未有接獲有病徵人士致電查詢。中心的流行病學調查仍然繼續。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

This conference, cohosted by the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong for the first time, showcases the close collaboration between the two places in the areas of railway safety and regulation, as well as their influence on the global railway professional field.

With the theme ""Advancing Railway Safety through Innovations and Collaborations"", the conference features four days of plenary sessions and two days of technical visits. It provides a platform for railway safety regulators, operators and relevant stakeholders from around the world to engage in in-depth discussions on global railway safety issues, and to share and exchange the latest developments and innovative technology applications of railways in various places.

The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee; Deputy Administrator of the NRA Mr Wang Qiming; and the Chairman of the MTRCL, Dr Rex Auyeung, officiated at the opening ceremony. Other officiating guests included the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan; the Secretary of the IRSC Core Group, Ms Ann Mills; the Director of Electrical and Mechanical Services, Mr Raymond Poon; the Chief Executive Officer of the MTRCL, Dr Jacob Kam; Deputy Director-General of the Safety Supervision and Management Bureau of China Railway (SSMBCR) Mr Wang Zhi; and the President of the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (HKIE), Ms Alice Chow.

Speaking at the opening ceremony, Mr Lee said that railways serve as a powerful engine driving connectivity, resilience and progress, and he is confident that by prioritising safety, embracing innovation and deepening collaboration, the industry will continue to enhance lives and connect countries and communities around the world. He added that Hong Kong is honoured to work with Chinese Mainland and global partners to advance railway development.

In addition, the HKSAR Government considers that the introduction of the Chinese Mainland railway standards can help Hong Kong make better use of Chinese Mainland resources in order to effectively reduce costs and shorten construction periods while maintaining safety and service levels. The Highways Department is formulating the new Hong Kong Railway Standards, which are expected to be completed in the coming weeks.

Hong Kong is the first city among all IRSC member countries and regions to have hosted the annual conference four times, fully demonstrating the IRSC's recognition of Hong Kong's outstanding achievements in railway development, safety standards and operational performance. Hong Kong boasts world-class railway networks renowned for safety, efficiency and reliability, making it an ideal platform for advancing global dialogue and collaboration on railway safety.

The IRSC comprises 24 core member institutions from 15 countries and regions worldwide. Since its establishment in 1990, the IRSC has endeavoured to foster international exchange and enhance railway safety by convening annual conferences in different cities around the world.

海關早前接獲舉報，指有人在網上社交平台開設專頁，提供規避電子遊戲機的收費服務和售賣懷疑侵權電子遊戲。經深入調查及在版權擁有人的協助下，海關於十一月二十四採取執法行動，突擊搜查一個位於觀塘的工廈單位及一間位於荃灣的店鋪，並檢獲該批懷疑涉案的電子遊戲機及懷疑侵權遊戲機套裝。同時，海關的電腦法證所人員亦到場支援，透過現場電腦搜證，在該用作處理侵權遊戲的電腦連外置式儲存裝置中，搜獲超過五千個懷疑侵權遊戲檔案。

行動中，海關拘捕兩名涉案男子，年齡分別為四十二歲和三十八歲。

案件仍在調查中，兩名被捕人士現正保釋候查。

海關指，版權擁有人已就其遊戲機作出有效科技保護措施，防止任何未獲授權的遊戲檔案在遊戲機上運行，而被捕人士涉嫌以規避技術使侵權遊戲可於遊戲機上運行。

海關提醒商戶，切勿參與規避行為，因出售規避器件或提供規避服務屬嚴重罪行。市民亦應尊重知識產權，不要購買任何規避器件。規避器件所連接的不知名網站可能附有電腦病毒或惡意程式，為用家帶來風險。

根據《版權條例》，任何人管有侵犯版權複製品作出售用途，一經定罪，最高可被判監禁四年，及每件侵權物品罰款五萬元。此外，任何人為任何規避業務的目的，或在任何規避業務的過程中，出售或出租有關器件，或提供有關服務使人能夠規避有效科技措施，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五十萬元及監禁四年。

Hong Kong Customs detects suspected infringing case involving circumventing game consoles (with photo),2025-11-26 18:30,2025-11-26 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/26/P2025112600614.htm,"Hong Kong Customs conducted an enforcement operation on November 24 to combat infringing activities involving circumventing game consoles. Eight game consoles suspected to be connected with the case, 13 sets of suspected infringing game consoles, 29 memory cards containing suspected infringing games, a desktop computer with an external hard disk used for dealing with infringing games and a batch of computer equipment were seized. The total estimated market value was about $150,000.

  Customs earlier received information alleging that someone offered paid services to circumvent game consoles and sold suspected infringing electronic games through a social media platform page. After a thorough investigation and with the assistance of the copyright owner, Customs officers took enforcement action on November 24. An industrial unit in Kwun Tong and a retail shop in Tsuen Wan were raided, and the batch of game consoles connected with the case and the suspected infringing game consoles were seized. Customs officers from the Computer Forensic Laboratory were also summoned to the scene to support the operation. Through an on-site digital examination, more than 5 000 suspected infringing game files were found from the computer connected with an external storage media, which was used to process infringing games.

During the operation, two men, aged 42 and 38, were arrested.

  An investigation is ongoing, and the arrested persons have been released on bail pending further investigation.

  Customs noted that the copyright owner had applied an effective technological measure in his game consoles to prevent any unauthorised games being played on any devices, and the arrested persons are suspected of using circumvention technology to enable the infringing games to run on the game consoles.

  Customs reminds traders not to take part in circumvention activities since selling a circumvention device or providing a circumvention service is a serious crime. Also, members of the public should respect intellectual property rights and not buy any circumvention devices. Unknown websites connected with circumvention devices might contain computer viruses or malware which can pose a risk to users.

  Under the Copyright Ordinance, any person who possesses an infringing copy of a copyright work with a view to selling it commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $50,000 per infringing copy and imprisonment for four years. Any person who, for the purpose of a circumvention business, or in the course of a circumvention business, sells or lets for hire a relevant device, or provides relevant services in order to allow circumventing an effective technological measure which has been applied in relation to a copyright work, is liable to a maximum penalty of a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for four years.

Members of the public may report any suspected infringement activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

The Transport Advisory Committee (TAC) was briefed today (November 26) by the Government on the latest progress of the Traffic and Transport Strategy Study (TTSS) and the general directions of the Transport Strategy Blueprint (the Blueprint).

The Blueprint is scheduled for announcement this year, and will set out the vision statement of ""Implementing a People-centric Approach, Strengthening Connectivity with both the Mainland and the World, Promoting Efficient Travel, and Embracing a Green Lifestyle"". It has formulated three main themes for the future traffic and transport development, namely ""Enjoyable Journeys"", ""Well-connected City"" and ""Healthy Mobility"".

The theme ""Enjoyable Journeys"" upholds a public transport-oriented policy and optimises passengers' travel experiences. The theme ""Well-connected City"" focuses on embracing advanced technology to improve transport efficiency, promoting digitalised traffic management. The theme ""Healthy Mobility"" actively promotes green travel from a planning perspective. Centred around these three main themes, the Government has formulated six key strategies covering multiple recommendations.

The TAC Chairman, Professor Wong Sze-chun, said, ""Members noted with appreciation the progress of the TTSS and expressed views at the meeting on the main themes and key strategies of the Blueprint. We welcome the Government's various new measures, including building a new generation of Transport Interchange Hubs, enhancing the flexibility of public transport, promoting the development of autonomous vehicles, implementing smart motorway management, conducting a new round of a parking demand study, advocating a ""15-minute neighbourhood"" planning concept, etc. We support the Government in continuing to leverage the strengths of Hong Kong's efficient public transport, enhancing local and cross-boundary transport networks, advancing smart technology for upgrading and transformation, and promoting low-carbon and inclusive mobility.""

Members anticipate that through implementing the Blueprint, Hong Kong's traffic and transport development will continue to advance, creating a city that is more liveable, business friendly and attractive to visitors, thereby enhancing the flow of people and goods within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and promoting the economic and sustainable development of Hong Kong."

十一月份第五批涵蓋13個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及八個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十一月共五批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共48個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年十月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這48個監察區中，38個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有10區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"
「1+」機制下首款先進療法製品獲批註冊,2025-11-26 17:00,2025-11-26 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/26/P2025112600486.htm,"​政府發言人今日（十一月二十六日）表示，首次有先進療法製品在「1+」藥物審批機制下獲批註冊。該款先進療法製品用於治療多發性骨髓瘤，能為病患者帶來更多醫治選擇。政府會繼續致力加快引入創新藥械，讓病人盡早獲得先進診療，同時推動香港成為國際醫療創新樞紐。

新藥獲批
————
香港特別行政區（特區）於二○二三年十一月一日起實施「1+」機制，便利用以治療嚴重或罕見疾病的新藥來港註冊，並已於去年十一月一日起將「1+」機制擴展至所有新藥，包括任何含新藥劑或生物元素成分的製品及藥物新適應症、疫苗以至先進療法製品。新藥若能提供符合要求的本地臨床數據，並經本地專家認可後，只須提交一個（而非原來的兩個）參考藥物監管機構，便可以在香港申請註冊。

上述治療多發性骨髓瘤的新藥已獲中國內地的藥物監管機構批核，並成為擴展後的「1+」機制下獲批註冊的首款先進療法製品。這款新藥屬於基因療法製品和體細胞療法製品，通過經基因改造加入了嵌合抗原受體基因序列的T細胞（即CAR-T細胞）治療多發性骨髓瘤。香港藥劑業及毒藥管理局轄下的註冊委員會在對申請人提交的臨床數據及相關資料作出審評及經徵詢本地專家的意見後，認為該款新藥符合相關安全、效能及素質標準，批准在香港註冊。衞生署已通知申請人有關審批結果。

有序邁向「第一層審批」
———————————
自「1+」機制生效以來，連同上述該款新藥，現時共有十六款新藥按此機制獲批准註冊，其中七款新藥已獲納入醫院管理局藥物名冊。衞生署一直積極透過不同渠道宣傳「1+」機制，至今已收到170多間藥廠超過660個查詢，當中包括海外及內地藥廠。不少公司已表示有興趣在擴展的「1+」機制下為包括先進療法製品的藥物提交註冊申請。衞生署亦已推出「1+」新藥註冊申請前會面諮詢服務，於今年三月起先後舉辦多場簡介講座及新藥註冊工作坊，並計劃在短期內推出申請前諮詢會議，以提升處理相關申請的效率。

《行政長官2025年施政報告》公布特區政府會提速落實支持藥械的制度改革工作，鞏固香港作為國際醫療創新樞紐的地位。衞生署會加快「1+」新藥審批機制，試行優先審批經醫院管理局建議能應對治療嚴重或罕見疾病的創新藥，加快病人使用最先進治療。衞生署亦將於二○二六年內成立「香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心」；以及於二○二六年開始分階段實施「第一層審批」新藥註冊機制。為此，衞生署會繼續積極推進「第一層審批」新藥註冊機制的準備工作，並逐步建立完善的審批制度，為香港特區以至國家及其他地區的醫療健康產業發展和市場拓展注入強大動力，將香港打造為國際醫療創新樞紐。"
"First advanced therapy product approved for registration under ""1+"" mechanism",2025-11-26 17:00,2025-11-26 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/26/P2025112600488.htm,"âA Government spokesman announced today (November 26) that an advanced therapy product has been approved for registration under the ""1+"" drug approval mechanism for the first time. This advanced therapy product is used to treat patients with multiple myeloma, bringing more treatment options for patients. The Government continues to strive to accelerate the introduction of innovative drugs and medical devices so that patients can gain early access to advanced diagnoses and treatments, while developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub.

New drug approved
----------------------
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has implemented the ""1+"" mechanism since November 1, 2023, to facilitate the registration of new drugs used for the treatment of life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases in Hong Kong. With effect from November 1 last year, the ""1+"" mechanism has been extended to all new drugs, including all new chemical or biological entities and new indications, and vaccines and advanced therapy products. New drugs that are supported by local clinical data and recognised by local experts can be applied for registration in Hong Kong by submitting approval from one reference drug regulatory authority (instead of two in the past).

The above new drug used for the treatment of multiple myeloma has been approved by the drug regulatory authority in the Chinese Mainland and is the first advanced therapy product approved for registration under the expanded ""1+"" mechanism. This new drug is both a gene therapy product and somatic cell therapy product, which is used for treatment of multiple myeloma by means of genetically modified T-cells with additional genetic sequence for chimeric antigen receptor (i.e. CAR-T cells). Having evaluated the clinical data and relevant information submitted by the applicant and advice given by local expert, the Registration Committee under the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Hong Kong considered that the new drug satisfied the criteria of safety, efficacy and quality, and approved the registration of the new drug. The Department of Health (DH) has already notified the applicant of the result of the application.

Paving the way towards primary evaluation
------------------------------------------------

Since the implementation of the ""1+"" mechanism, a total of 16 new drugs, including the above drug, have been approved under this mechanism. Seven of them have been listed in the Hospital Authority Drug Formulary. The DH has been promoting the ""1+"" mechanism through different channels and so far has received more than 660 enquiries from over 170 pharmaceutical companies, including those from overseas and the Mainland. Many companies have expressed interests in submitting applications for registration of their products, including advanced therapy products, under the extended ""1+"" mechanism. Since the launch of the pre-new drug application consultation service in March this year, the DH has already held a number of briefing seminars and workshops. The DH will also have pre-new drug application meetings to be rolled out shortly, to enhance the efficiency in processing relevant applications.

""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" announced that the Government will accelerate the reform of the regulatory system of drugs and medical devices, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international health and medical innovation hub. The DH will expedite the ""1+"" mechanism for new drugs, piloting priority evaluation and approval of innovative drugs as recommended by the Hospital Authority for treatment of severe or rare diseases and to accelerate patients' use of the advanced treatments. The DH will establish the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation by the end of next year, and implement ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration in phases beginning next year. The DH will continue to proactively advance preparatory work for ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration and progressively establish a robust approval system, providing strong momentum for the development and market expansion of the healthcare industry in the HKSAR, the Mainland, and beyond, thereby transforming Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub.  "

Among the fifth batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 13 survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering eight survey areas in November, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released five batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in November 2025, covering 48 survey areas. Among these 48 survey areas, 38 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. October 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Ten other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation, and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."
Speech by SFST at Bloomberg's Greater Bay Area FinTech Talent Initiative Summit (English only),2025-11-26 16:48,2025-11-26 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/26/P2025112600293.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at Bloomberg's Greater Bay Area (GBA) FinTech Talent Initiative Summit today (November 26):

Bing (Head of Asia Pacific, Bloomberg, Mr Bing Li), Howard (Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Mr Howard Lee), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, and fellow colleagues in the fintech sectors,

 Good afternoon. It is a great honour and pleasure to join you today at the GBA FinTech Talent Initiative Summit, organised by Bloomberg. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Bloomberg for your continued commitment to fostering dialogue and collaboration in the fintech space. Our co-operation with Bloomberg has been exemplary, extending across various initiatives that strengthen Hong Kong's position as a global financial centre. For example, we recently marked the first anniversary of the Hong Kong Family Office Nexus - a strategic partnership between my bureau and Bloomberg. This collaboration integrates Bloomberg's global resources and technological expertise to provide a digital knowledge hub, professional insights, and exchange platforms for family offices. Such partnerships underscore our shared dedication to innovation and ecosystem building.

 On today's summit, it is particularly fitting that it places a special emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI) and our synergies with Shenzhen. These themes align closely with our shared vision of building a dynamic, innovative, and interconnected fintech ecosystem. I also wish to acknowledge the presence of esteemed speakers and participants, including representatives from our regulator, leading financial institutions, and technology firms. Your insights and expertise will undoubtedly enrich our discussions on empowering the GBA (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area) for an AI-driven future.

 Hong Kong has long been recognised as a global financial centre, underpinned by a robust regulatory framework, free flow of capital, and a deep pool of talent. In recent years, we have redoubled our efforts to promote fintech development, recognising its pivotal role in enhancing the competitiveness of our financial services sector and driving economic growth. Our multipronged approach encompasses upgrading financial infrastructure, nurturing a vibrant ecosystem, cultivating talent, and strengthening cross-boundary co-operation - particularly within the GBA.

 The fintech landscape in Hong Kong is thriving. Today, we host over 1 200 fintech companies, including eight digital banks, four virtual insurers, and 11 licensed digital asset trading platforms. This ecosystem is not only diverse but also innovative, attracting entrepreneurs, investors, and professionals from around the world. To further accelerate this momentum, the Government issued a policy statement in October last year on the responsible application of AI in the financial market. This statement underscores our commitment to an open-minded approach, where we closely monitor market developments, draw on international best practices, and promote the ethical use of AI to foster new quality productive forces in finance.

 Talent is the cornerstone of any successful innovation hub, and this is especially true for fintech. The GBA FinTech Talent Initiative Summit provides an invaluable platform to address this critical element. In Hong Kong, we have implemented a series of targeted measures to nurture and attract fintech talent. For instance, in October 2023, my bureau launched the GBA FinTech Two-way Internship Scheme for Post-secondary Students. This scheme subsidises students from the Mainland and Hong Kong to undertake short-term internships in fintech companies, enhancing talent exchange and expanding our talent pool. In April this year, we had provided around 50 positions in our summer programme, with over 100 students participating across four rounds to date.

 Complementing this, in September 2022, we introduced the Pilot Scheme on Training Subsidy for Fintech Practitioners, which reimburses training costs for those attaining professional qualifications. As of October this year, around 730 practitioners have enrolled in relevant courses, equipping them with the skills needed to thrive in this rapidly evolving field.

 Our focus on AI talent is equally robust. In August last year, the HKMA and Cyberport launched the Generative AI Sandbox, providing banks with a risk-managed environment to test innovative AI use cases. The first cohort, announced in December last year, explored applications in risk management, anti-fraud measures, and customer experience. This was followed by a second cohort in April this year, selecting 27 use cases from 20 banks and 14 technology partners. These initiatives not only build technical capabilities but also ensure that our workforce is prepared for the responsible deployment of AI technologies.

 Turning to cross-boundary collaboration, which is central to the GBA's success, Hong Kong is actively deepening ties with our Mainland counterparts, particularly Shenzhen. Just this month, the FSTB (Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau) and the Shenzhen Municipal Financial Regulatory Bureau jointly promulgated the Action Plan for Jointly Building Hong Kong-Shenzhen Global Fintech Hub (2025-2027). This plan leverages Hong Kong's strengths in fintech innovation and Shenzhen's prowess in industrial finance, covering key areas such as digital finance, techfin, green finance, inclusive finance, and pension finance. It aims to establish a world-class fintech centre through enhanced co-operation.

 These efforts are part of a broader strategy to integrate fintech into the GBA's economic fabric. Furthermore, in June this year, the People's Bank of China and the HKMA launched Payment Connect, linking the Mainland's Internet Banking Payment System with Hong Kong's Faster Payment System (FPS). This initiative enables secure, real-time cross-boundary remittances using just mobile and an account number. By July this year, it had processed over 700 000 transactions worth RMB4 billion. Meanwhile, our FPS has seen remarkable growth, with 18.31 million registrations and an average daily turnover of 2.17 million transactions worth HK$16.9 billion as of October 2025.

 Also, our commitment extends to green and sustainable fintech. In June last year, the Government launched the Green and Sustainable Fintech Proof-of-Concept Funding Support Scheme, approving 60 projects to date. This initiative aims to position Hong Kong as a green fintech hub by funding solutions with potentials to be commercialised.

 Looking ahead, the Government will continue to provide an enabling environment for fintech to flourish. We will work closely with regulators, industry players, and our GBA partners - including valued collaborators like Bloomberg - to address challenges and seize opportunities, particularly in AI-driven innovations. Events like this summit are crucial for exchanging ideas and forging partnerships that will shape the future of finance in the region.

 In closing, I am confident that the discussions today - from the fireside chat with industry leaders to the panel on empowering the GBA for an AI-driven future - will inspire actionable insights. Let us harness the collective wisdom here to build a more innovative, inclusive, and sustainable fintech ecosystem.

 Thank you once again to Bloomberg and all participants. I wish the summit every success."

房屋局公布最新一季的公屋綜合輪候時間,2025-11-26 14:00,2025-11-26 14:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/26/P2025112600209.htm,"房屋局今日（十一月二十六日）公布最新一季的公屋綜合輪候時間。

截至二○二五年九月底，在過去12個月獲安排入住傳統公共租住房屋（公屋）或「簡約公屋」的一般申請者（即家庭申請者及長者一人申請者）的公屋綜合輪候時間維持在5.1年，繼續保持自二○一八年第一季以來的最低紀錄。與本屆政府上任前的高位6.1年比較，公屋綜合輪候時間縮短了整整一年。

房屋局發言人表示：「在二○二五年第三季，我們成功安排總數多達約7 900個一般申請者入住傳統公屋或『簡約公屋』，包括約1 600個新落成的傳統公屋單位、約4 000個傳統公屋的回收單位，以及約2 300個『簡約公屋』單位。獲安排入住傳統公屋單位的一般申請者中，超過八成半入住市區或擴展市區單位，這些都是非常受申請者歡迎的區份。但由於市區或擴展市區單位的輪候時間，比新界長約兩年之多，而他們較長的輪候時間都被計算在最新的公屋綜合輪候時間中，所以今季儘管已有約8 000個單位的龐大供應，公屋綜合輪候時間仍只能維持與上季一樣的5.1年。」

另一方面，入住「簡約公屋」的一般申請者的輪候時間則明顯較短。事實上，自首個「簡約公屋」項目於二○二五年第一季開始編配入住以來，獲安排入住「簡約公屋」的一般申請者的輪候時間平均僅為3.1年，充分突顯「簡約公屋」不僅改善了低收入家庭的居住環境和生活質素，更在縮短公屋輪候時間上發揮了關鍵作用。

首個位於市區的牛頭角彩興路「簡約公屋」項目已於二○二五年九月初全面入伙。現時已入伙該項目的居民中，約七成原先居住在不適切住房（如「劏房」、天台屋和床位等）。隨着各個公屋及「簡約公屋」項目陸續落成，公屋綜合輪候時間會逐步下降，反映公屋申請者可以更快獲編配到適切居所，即時幫助有關家庭脫離困境，並大幅減輕租金負擔，從而展開新的家庭生活，甚至開始累積儲蓄。

房屋局發言人表示：「我們會繼續興建公屋，並積極推展餘下的『簡約公屋』項目，在二○二五年預計會共有約9 500個單位陸續落成入伙，逐步邁向在二○二七／二八年度前完成興建約30 000個『簡約公屋』單位的目標。」

「此外，在我們採取多管齊下的方法加快公屋單位流轉的努力下，輪候公屋的一般申請者數目進一步下降。在二○二五年九月底，約有111 600宗一般公屋申請，以及約85 700宗配額及計分制下的非長者一人申請。與最高位的156 400宗及143700宗比較，一般公屋申請及非長者一人申請的數目分別大幅下降約30%及40%，清楚顯示公屋輪候隊伍正在消化中。」

展望二○二六／二七年度起的五年，總體公營房屋建屋量（包括「簡約公屋」）將達189 000個單位，較本屆政府上任時增加約80%。在本屆政府三年多以來全力「提速、提量、提質、提效」的不懈努力下，公營房屋落成量已完全扭轉了「頭輕尾重」的情況，可加快滿足低收入家庭的住屋需求，公屋綜合輪候時間在二○二六／二七年度回落至4.5年的目標不變。"
Housing Bureau releases latest Composite Waiting Time for Subsidised Rental Housing,2025-11-26 14:00,2025-11-26 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/26/P2025112600210.htm,"  The Housing Bureau (HB) released today (November 26) the latest Composite Waiting Time for Subsidised Rental Housing (CWT).

  As at end-September 2025, the CWT for general applicants (i.e. family and elderly one-person applicants) that were housed in public rental housing (PRH) or Light Public Housing (LPH) in the past 12 months has been maintained at 5.1 years, which is again the lowest record since the first quarter of 2018. Compared with the highest level of 6.1 years before the current-term Government took office, the CWT has been shortened by a full year.

  A spokesman for the HB said, ""In the third quarter of 2025, we successfully arranged a total of about 7 900 general applicants to be housed to PRH or LPH, including about 1 600 newly completed PRH units, about 4 000 recovered PRH flats and about 2 300 LPH units. Among the general applicants housed to PRH, over 85 per cent were housed to Urban districts and Extended Urban districts, which are very popular districts among applicants. However, the waiting time for Urban districts and Extended Urban districts is about two years longer than that for the New Territories, thus their longer waiting time has been taken into account in the latest CWT. Despite the huge housing supply of around 8 000 units this quarter, the CWT has been maintained at 5.1 years as in the last quarter.""

  On the other hand, the waiting time for general applicants housed to LPH is obviously shorter. In fact, since the first LPH project began allocations in the first quarter of 2025, the waiting time of general applicants who were housed to LPH is only 3.1 years on average. This fully highlights that LPH has not only improved the living conditions and quality of life of low-income families, but has also played a key role in shortening the waiting time for PRH.

  The LPH project at Choi Hing Road in Ngau Tau Kok, being the first LPH project in an urban area, has been fully occupied in early September 2025. Among the residents who have moved into the project, about 70 per cent had previously been living in inadequate housing (e.g. sub-divided units, rooftop houses and bedspaces, etc). With the gradual completion of various PRH and LPH projects, the CWT will in turn decline, reflecting that PRH applicants will be allocated to adequate housing more quickly. Not only does this immediately help those families overcome their housing difficulties, but also significantly relieves their rental burden, thereby commencing a new family life and even starting to accumulate their own savings.

  A spokesman for the HB said, ""We will continue building PRH and take forward the remaining LPH projects proactively. It is anticipated that about 9 500 LPH units will be gradually completed for intake in 2025, moving towards the target of completing the construction of about 30 000 LPH units by 2027-28.

  ""In addition, with our multipronged approach to expedite the turnover of PRH flats, the number of PRH general applicants has further decreased. As at end-September 2025, there were about 111 600 general applications for PRH, and about 85 700 non-elderly one-person applications under the Quota and Points System. As compared with the highest level of 156400 cases and 143700 cases of general applications and non-elderly one-person applications, the application number has been reduced significantly by around 30 per cent and 40 per cent respectively, clearly demonstrating that the PRH waiting queue is being reduced.""

  Looking ahead to the five years starting from 2026-27, the overall public housing production (including LPH) will reach 189â¯000 units, about 80 per cent higher than when the current-term Government took office. Under the current-term Government's unremitting efforts to ""enhance speed, quantity, quality and efficiency"" in the past three years, the back-loaded situation has been completely reversed by the public housing production. This shift has enabled faster fulfillment of the housing needs of low-income families. The target of reducing the CWT to 4.5 years by 2026-27 remains unchanged."

政務司司長：各位傳媒朋友大家早晨。

十二月七日就是立法會選舉，大家都留意到，政府官員近日馬不停蹄，走訪不同地區、部門和機構，各政府部門亦進行各式各樣的宣傳，齊心協力，呼籲所有合資格選民在選舉日履行公民責任，齊投票、選賢能。

為了加強「投入選舉共創未來」的立法會選舉信息，感謝市民踴躍投票，選民在十二月七日在投票站投票後，會獲派發一張心意謝卡。剛才我向大家展現了今年心意謝卡的設計。

心意謝卡由香港生成式人工智能研發中心團隊以生成式AI技術設計，政府新聞處及政府物流服務署製作和印製，封面有選舉吉祥物票箱寶寶，即「藍小寶」、「紅小寶」及「白爺爺」，感謝廣大市民在立法會選舉中投票，寓意全社會一起努力，同創香港的美好未來。

此外，十二月六日星期六，即投票日之前一日，政府會舉辦「選舉繽紛日」，在全港各區舉行一系列多元化的活動，與眾同樂迎接選舉。活動內容豐富，詳情會於今日稍後公布，其中的亮點包括：

（一）我們會在十二月六日晚上於西九文化區舉辦「同心‧投票‧創未來大匯演」，匯聚各台藝人獻技、著名魔術師的大型魔幻表演、大型舞蹈表演及互動環節，務求與民同樂，體現萬眾一心支持選舉。

（二）我們會在十二月六日於多處舉辦嘉年華，例如於大埔海濱公園舉行的公民教育嘉年華，以及於灣仔和北角海濱提供水陸體驗活動等。康文署（康樂及文化事務署）亦會在六個場地舉辦「選舉樂繽紛」，推出充滿體育元素的互動活動。

（三）不同單位會在十二月六日於港九新界舉辦展覽及攤位遊戲，主題多元化。當中，環境及生態局會聯同九巴於荔枝角月輪街車廠展出古董巴士及電動巴士。

（四）八個紀律部隊會在十二月六日舉辦活動或開放轄下設施予公眾參觀，例如開放青衣消防局，以及位於西貢、大美督及大帽山的政府飛行服務隊停機坪。

為進一步提高社會對選舉關心的氣氛和提醒市民履行公民責任，為十二月七日的選舉營造更良好氣氛，並提升大家的公民意識，特區政府多個部門亦會安排在十二月六及七日為所有市民免費開放設施，或提供禮物或優惠。我想強調，無論投票與否，均對所有巿民開放。

政府會於十二月六及七日兩日向所有香港市民免費開放香港濕地公園，以及康樂及文化事務署轄下的公眾游泳池、香港科學館、香港太空館和香港藝術館。我們會豁免收費，歡迎巿民前往參觀。

此外，市民在該兩日到「綠在區區」回收設施進行回收時，可獲取雙倍積分。這是特別為「綠在區區」而設的。

食物環境衞生署於十二月六及七日則會在不同街市進行宣傳選舉的活動，並向市民派發小禮品。

至於消費優惠方面，房屋委員會指定商場、街市及油塘「大本型」商場消費滿指定金額，可獲額外一小時免費泊車。

同時，亦會有多項參觀歷史建築及古蹟的優惠；而自十二月六日開始，法定古蹟景賢里將於逢星期六及日開設導賞團予市民免費報名參加。

上述安排的細節會於稍後公布。

特區政府知道社會不同界別人士都非常熱心支持選舉，除有不少私人企業、商戶、食肆等已經自發宣布在選舉日推出優惠，我知道有很多機構、商會、商戶及商場等，正在密鑼緊鼓進行籌備工作，為已經投票的選民提供不同形式的優惠，可以說是摩拳擦掌，等待特區政府公布心意謝卡的安排後，它們很快便會作出公布。

這些優惠不單進一步提升社會的選舉氣氛，更加讓巿民在投票過程中感受到額外的喜悅和獲得感，我亦希望社會氣氛能帶動年輕人和尚未登記的巿民加入選民行列，為將來的選舉奠定更廣泛的參與基礎。

特區政府感謝社會各界的熱烈響應，為推廣選舉出一分力，並期望會有更多機構和企業繼續加入。

最後，我呼籲市民和社會各界積極參與上述的活動，並盡情享用各界提供的優惠，享受一個愉快的周末，並在十二月七日星期日踴躍參與投票，選出有能力、有幹勁、有擔當的立法會議員。多謝大家。

記者：如果提供優惠的商戶，他們的店鋪只是張貼特定的候選人海報，或跟候選人屬同一個工會或公司，會否違法？另外想問心意卡，政府今年預計的心意卡印製量是多少？數目是如何預計？預算大概是多少？

政務司司長：第一，我們很感謝商鋪提供優惠，鼓勵選民去投票。最重要一點，不能指示接受優惠的人投某個候選人或不投某個候選人，這是重點。我見到所有優惠都是投了票便可享用，不管你投哪個，在法律上沒有問題，所以鼓勵投票是絕對可以的。

至於印製心意卡的數量，我們在印製中，會有足夠的數量給所有投票的選民，所以我們呼籲選民不用擔心，一定有足夠的數量。

記者：兩個問題，首先想問其實一些政府部門會否用這張心意卡做憑據，來檢查公務員有沒有前往投票？同時會否擔心商界會仿效，因為商界很多都會提供半日假期給員工，會否怕他們用這張心意卡來秋後算帳？第二，想問雖然剛剛司長你都談到其實投票與否，市民都可以享用這項優惠和設施，但如果最後有大量沒有投票的市民使用了這些優惠或者設施，會否怕不能達到當局預計的成效，想提高公民意識和營造一個良好的投票氣氛？多謝。

政務司司長：第一，政府提出的一些優惠安排是歡迎所有市民享用。所有市民去享用，我們的目的就已經達到。我們希望當日大家有一個好開心的氣氛，亦希望大家知道政府給予這些優惠的目的是甚麼——目的當然是希望選民去投票，這當然是政府的目的。如果有些非選民參與，也希望他們認識到選舉的重要性，如果尚未登記做選民，推動他們將來成為選民，希望他們可以在下一次的選舉積極參與。

這張心意謝卡整個安排中沒有記名，沒有編號，每一張是完全一樣的，所以我們不能用這張心意謝卡去證明某一個人有沒有去投票——我可以借用你的心意謝卡，你可以拿我的心意謝卡，其實沒有必要，我們亦不會這樣做。

公務員方面，我們鼓勵他們去投票，因為他們除了是市民外，也是公務員。今次政府舉辦立法會選舉，是我們很重要的一項工作。他是一名公務員，他應該支持政府的工作。我們不會用心意謝卡去檢查他有沒有去投票，我們反而希望每一位公務員明白這個道理而自發去投票，這才是重點。

記者：你好，我們想問一下，這次政府提供的系列優惠，有否估計大概涉及多少公帑，是否屬於選舉的宣傳開支？第二條問題，如果有商界或組織直接提供一些現金獎勵去鼓勵投票，政府這方面是否覺得適合，態度是如何？會否擔心引起市民的負面觀感？謝謝。

政務司司長：首先，我想這樣說，我們鼓勵亦多謝商界提供一些優惠或方便給選民去投票。我們希望達到的目的有幾個，我再重複一次，就是我們希望，第一，大家都積極參與投票，為香港更好的未來製造條件。因為立法會是很重要，立法會議員任期不短，是四年，我們希望立法會選舉選出來的議員真的能夠反映市民的心聲。經常有市民跟我們說，希望政府能夠在立法會內聽到他們的聲音。其實立法會是一個非常重要的反映民意的機構，跟政府的合作是非常緊密，亦非常重要，所以為甚麼我們經常呼籲大家去投票，選出認為適合你的立法會議員，代表你在立法會發聲。大家不要認為所有立法會議員都差不多，大家都是愛國者，背景差不多，其實不然。每個議員都有不同背景、不同立場、不同主張，不是每一個都適合每一位市民，有些市民覺得勞工議題較重要，有些覺得經濟發展較重要，所以希望大家藉着這個立法會選舉，能夠選出一些真正能夠代表大家的議員。

在未來來說，因為有四年這麼長，香港由亂到治，現在由治及興，未來政府的發展亦很重要，政府很重視議員提供的意見。舉第七屆立法會為例，（政府因應）議員（意見）一共提出了1 800項修正案，比上一屆多出六成（應為超過一倍），而通過的法案亦有約130條之多，這些全都反映出立法會跟政府的合作很重要。他們的意見代表了市民的意見，我們都是聽取他們的意見後，優化我們的法案和政策，所以這是很重要。因此，我們覺得應該要用一切力量去鼓勵市民參與，引起市民對這件事的關注度，這亦是一件開心事，因為大家都覺得立法會選舉是一個開心的日子，所以我們希望在那兩日周末亦有很多香港市民留在香港投票，我們希望他們使用免費開放的設施，跟家人一起享受一個愉快的下午。

至於你提到鼓勵投票的重點，我經常說，重點是甚麼呢，最重要的是提供優惠不是叫選民去選或不選某一個候選人。大家都聽到、看到，投了票就可以，就會有優惠，在法例上來說是完全沒有問題的。我相信所有商家，如果提供優惠的話，最重要是有這個宗旨，所以我希望大家配合，亦希望傳媒朋友幫忙，盡量幫我們做更多宣傳，鼓勵市民在十二月七日投票，因為的而且確，投票對於香港的未來發展是至關重要的。謝謝各位。

​政務司司長會見傳媒答問內容（附圖／短片）,2025-11-26 13:30,2025-11-26 14:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/26/P2025112600316.htm,"政務司司長陳國基聯同政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞，今日（十一月二十六日）就二○二五年立法會換屆選舉期間向選民派發心意謝卡的安排會見傳媒。以下是陳國基會見傳媒的答問內容：

政務司司長：各位傳媒朋友大家早晨。

十二月七日就是立法會選舉，大家都留意到，政府官員近日馬不停蹄，走訪不同地區、部門和機構，各政府部門亦進行各式各樣的宣傳，齊心協力，呼籲所有合資格選民在選舉日履行公民責任，齊投票、選賢能。

為了加強「投入選舉共創未來」的立法會選舉信息，感謝市民踴躍投票，選民在十二月七日在投票站投票後，會獲派發一張心意謝卡。剛才我向大家展現了今年心意謝卡的設計。

心意謝卡由香港生成式人工智能研發中心團隊以生成式AI技術設計，政府新聞處及政府物流服務署製作和印製，封面有選舉吉祥物票箱寶寶，即「藍小寶」、「紅小寶」及「白爺爺」，感謝廣大市民在立法會選舉中投票，寓意全社會一起努力，同創香港的美好未來。

此外，十二月六日星期六，即投票日之前一日，政府會舉辦「選舉繽紛日」，在全港各區舉行一系列多元化的活動，與眾同樂迎接選舉。活動內容豐富，詳情會於今日稍後公布，其中的亮點包括：

（一）我們會在十二月六日晚上於西九文化區舉辦「同心‧投票‧創未來大匯演」，匯聚各台藝人獻技、著名魔術師的大型魔幻表演、大型舞蹈表演及互動環節，務求與民同樂，體現萬眾一心支持選舉。

（二）我們會在十二月六日於多處舉辦嘉年華，例如於大埔海濱公園舉行的公民教育嘉年華，以及於灣仔和北角海濱提供水陸體驗活動等。康文署（康樂及文化事務署）亦會在六個場地舉辦「選舉樂繽紛」，推出充滿體育元素的互動活動。

（三）不同單位會在十二月六日於港九新界舉辦展覽及攤位遊戲，主題多元化。當中，環境及生態局會聯同九巴於荔枝角月輪街車廠展出古董巴士及電動巴士。

（四）八個紀律部隊會在十二月六日舉辦活動或開放轄下設施予公眾參觀，例如開放青衣消防局，以及位於西貢、大美督及大帽山的政府飛行服務隊停機坪。

為進一步提高社會對選舉關心的氣氛和提醒市民履行公民責任，為十二月七日的選舉營造更良好氣氛，並提升大家的公民意識，特區政府多個部門亦會安排在十二月六及七日為所有市民免費開放設施，或提供禮物或優惠。我想強調，無論投票與否，均對所有巿民開放。

政府會於十二月六及七日兩日向所有香港市民免費開放香港濕地公園，以及康樂及文化事務署轄下的公眾游泳池、香港科學館、香港太空館和香港藝術館。我們會豁免收費，歡迎巿民前往參觀。

此外，市民在該兩日到「綠在區區」回收設施進行回收時，可獲取雙倍積分。這是特別為「綠在區區」而設的。

食物環境衞生署於十二月六及七日則會在不同街市進行宣傳選舉的活動，並向市民派發小禮品。

至於消費優惠方面，房屋委員會指定商場、街市及油塘「大本型」商場消費滿指定金額，可獲額外一小時免費泊車。

同時，亦會有多項參觀歷史建築及古蹟的優惠；而自十二月六日開始，法定古蹟景賢里將於逢星期六及日開設導賞團予市民免費報名參加。

上述安排的細節會於稍後公布。

特區政府知道社會不同界別人士都非常熱心支持選舉，除有不少私人企業、商戶、食肆等已經自發宣布在選舉日推出優惠，我知道有很多機構、商會、商戶及商場等，正在密鑼緊鼓進行籌備工作，為已經投票的選民提供不同形式的優惠，可以說是摩拳擦掌，等待特區政府公布心意謝卡的安排後，它們很快便會作出公布。

這些優惠不單進一步提升社會的選舉氣氛，更加讓巿民在投票過程中感受到額外的喜悅和獲得感，我亦希望社會氣氛能帶動年輕人和尚未登記的巿民加入選民行列，為將來的選舉奠定更廣泛的參與基礎。

特區政府感謝社會各界的熱烈響應，為推廣選舉出一分力，並期望會有更多機構和企業繼續加入。

最後，我呼籲市民和社會各界積極參與上述的活動，並盡情享用各界提供的優惠，享受一個愉快的周末，並在十二月七日星期日踴躍參與投票，選出有能力、有幹勁、有擔當的立法會議員。多謝大家。

記者：如果提供優惠的商戶，他們的店鋪只是張貼特定的候選人海報，或跟候選人屬同一個工會或公司，會否違法？另外想問心意卡，政府今年預計的心意卡印製量是多少？數目是如何預計？預算大概是多少？

政務司司長：第一，我們很感謝商鋪提供優惠，鼓勵選民去投票。最重要一點，不能指示接受優惠的人投某個候選人或不投某個候選人，這是重點。我見到所有優惠都是投了票便可享用，不管你投哪個，在法律上沒有問題，所以鼓勵投票是絕對可以的。

至於印製心意卡的數量，我們在印製中，會有足夠的數量給所有投票的選民，所以我們呼籲選民不用擔心，一定有足夠的數量。

記者：兩個問題，首先想問其實一些政府部門會否用這張心意卡做憑據，來檢查公務員有沒有前往投票？同時會否擔心商界會仿效，因為商界很多都會提供半日假期給員工，會否怕他們用這張心意卡來秋後算帳？第二，想問雖然剛剛司長你都談到其實投票與否，市民都可以享用這項優惠和設施，但如果最後有大量沒有投票的市民使用了這些優惠或者設施，會否怕不能達到當局預計的成效，想提高公民意識和營造一個良好的投票氣氛？多謝。

Bosco (Representative of the Hong Kong Fashion Council, Mr Bosco Law), Amanda (Chief Executive Officer of the Fairchild Media Group, Ms Amanda Smith), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. I am delighted to welcome you to the WWD (Women's Wear Daily) x SJ (Sourcing Journal) Global Fashion & Business Conference. A heartfelt greeting goes to our speakers and guests who have travelled from near and far to be with us today.
  
  The fashion industry is one of the most dynamic industries, facing challenges but also offering abundant opportunities. With the theme ""Global Creativity and the Fashion Imagination"", this conference gathers visionary minds to dive into inspiring topics at the forefront of fashion, such as cross-cultural creativity, innovation through heritage, storytelling in fashion, and global sourcing. These are all up-to-the-minute, important and practical topics on the global fashion agenda.
  
  At the same time, the conference convenes fashion leaders from the East and the West for insightful dialogue on the industry's future. It reflects Hong Kong's unique position as a gateway between the Chinese Mainland, Asia and the world, where cultures and creativity converge. I believe that today's conference will empower participants with valuable takeaways and inspire new ideas to shape the future of fashion worldwide.
  
  Hong Kong Fashion Fest 2025, sponsored by the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency of the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government and organised by our various partners, is now under way across the city and will continue until next Sunday (December 7). The wide range of programmes creates platforms for designers and brands across Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland, and many more countries and regions to build connections and pursue collaboration. It highlights Hong Kong's role as a global cultural bridge while demonstrating our growing influence as a fashion design hub in Asia. We warmly welcome all of you to join this signature event during your stay in Hong Kong.

"FS begins visit to London, UK (with photos/videos)",2025-11-26 10:09,2025-11-26 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/26/P2025112600185.htm,"âThe Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, arrived in London, the United Kingdom (UK), yesterday (London time, November 25) and commenced his visit.

Upon arrival, Mr Chan met with representatives from family offices across Europe, the Middle East and Asia. He highlighted Hong Kong's investment opportunities in the areas of finance and innovation and technology (I&T), the city's vibrant ecosystem for philanthropy and impact investing, and its high-quality living environment. He welcomed them to establish a presence in Hong Kong. Mr Chan also held a meeting with a financial institution that is planning to set up operations in the city.

Later, Mr Chan paid a courtesy call on the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the United Kingdom, Mr Zheng Zeguang. They exchanged views on Hong Kong's future development and China-UK relations.

In the evening, Mr Chan attended the Hong Kong Dinner hosted by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and delivered a keynote speech, during which he briefed political and business leaders in the UK on Hong Kong's latest developments and emerging opportunities.

Mr Chan pointed out that exchanges between Hong Kong and the UK in the areas of trade, investment and culture have become more frequent over the past year. Bilateral trade continues to grow, and two-way investment is expanding.

He stressed that the ""one country, two systems"" principle continues to be the cornerstone of Hong Kong's prosperity. Hong Kong's rule of law and common law system remain robust and are widely recognised internationally. Over the past year, international capital has continued to flow into Hong Kong, and more multinational enterprises have expanded their presence in the city — a clear reflection of international confidence in Hong Kong's business environment. For instance, the Hang Seng Index has risen by around 30 per cent this year following an 18 per cent increase last year. Hong Kong also leads the world in initial public offering (IPO) fundraising. Its asset and wealth management business as well as bank deposits have also continued to grow. These positive developments have attracted more international financial institutions to set up operations in the city.

On the economic front, Hong Kong has recorded gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 11 consecutive quarters, with the full-year growth forecast revised upward to 3.2 per cent. Tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions) activities have rebounded strongly, with visitor arrivals expected to reach 49 million this year.

Looking ahead, Mr Chan said that finance and I&T are two major engines driving Hong Kong's growth. In finance, Hong Kong is further strengthening its role as a ""super connector"" — helping Mainland enterprises go global while actively fostering closer ties with markets in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central Asia. Key initiatives include facilitating mutual access through mutual listing of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and strengthening regulatory co-operation. Technology is also empowering Hong Kong's capital markets. Nearly 60 per cent of IPO fundraising this year came from new economy companies, reflecting the effectiveness of recent listing regime reforms.

At the same time, Hong Kong is becoming a global leader in digital assets and Web3. The city recently issued the world's largest tranche of tokenised green bond, marking a step forward in asset tokenisation. Regulatory regimes are also in place for digital assets and stablecoins. Meanwhile, Hong Kong is also building new growth sectors. So far this year, 12 metal warehouses in the city have been approved by the London Metal Exchange, supporting Hong Kong's development into a commodity trading hub. Plans are also underway to develop an international gold trading centre.

In I&T, Mr Chan noted that Hong Kong is focusing on areas where it has a competitive edge — including artificial intelligence, biotech, fintech, and new energy and new materials. As part of its efforts to attract high-quality enterprises, the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises has successfully brought in over 100 high-impact tech companies over the past three years. These include leading global pharmaceutical firms such as AstraZeneca and GSK from the UK.

Mr Chan highlighted that the Northern Metropolis will serve as a key platform for driving I&T development. The Government is accelerating development in the area, including easing planning restrictions and adopting more flexible development models such as large-scale land disposals for high-impact projects, to drive the deep integration of land use and industry development. Preferential policy packages will also be introduced to attract top-tier enterprises. The Lok Ma Chau Loop area will become a cross-boundary innovation corridor, where capital, talent, goods, data and even biosamples will flow seamlessly from the Mainland to Hong Kong. These will be particularly appealing to international firms in the fields of AI and biotech.

In conclusion, Mr Chan said that Hong Kong's development prospects remain bright. He welcomed more UK enterprises and professionals to invest, do business, and pursue career development in Hong Kong to seize the vast opportunities ahead.

Mr Chan will continue his visit in London today (London time, November 26), before proceeding to Milan, Italy for the next leg of his trip."

Special traffic and transport arrangements for ceremony event at Kai Tak Stadium on November 28 and 29,2025-11-26 10:00,2025-11-26 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/26/P2025112600009.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (November 26) said that special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented to facilitate the holding of a ceremony event at Kai Tak Stadium on the evenings of November 28 and 29. As traffic in the vicinity of the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) is expected to be heavy, spectators should opt for public transport and avoid driving or taking private cars (including cross-boundary private cars).

  The TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators to strengthen their services during dispersal. The MTR will enhance the frequency of trains of the Tuen Ma Line. The last MTR train to Lo Wu Station via interchanging at Tai Wai Station on the East Rail Line will depart from Sung Wong Toi Station at 10.59pm and Kai Tak Station at 11.01pm. Franchised bus companies will provide 11 special bus routes at the Sung Wong Toi Road Pick-up/Drop-off Area (PUDOA) to Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange (route No. SP12), the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port and Airport (route No. A25S), and major districts across the territory.

  Spectators who plan to return to the Mainland on the same day may also take the KTSP's cross-boundary coach services during dispersal. Passengers should purchase tickets from the operators' online platforms in advance. On-site ticket sales will not be available during dispersal.

  The Kai Tak Stadium Taxi PUDOA will be open. The Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA will be open for taxi drop-off only during admission (4pm to 6.30pm) and suspended for taxi pick-up/drop-off during dispersal. The expected waiting time will be longer amid the outflux of spectators, and passengers' patience is appreciated.

  Spectators are advised to heed real-time information via the on-site broadcast and the ""Easy Leave"" platform (easyleave.police.gov.hk) as well as the latest traffic news through the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk), the ""HKeMobility"" mobile application and radio and television broadcasts."

尊敬的花有副特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署副特派員）、宋一平巡視員（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全公署聯絡局二級巡視員）、李大宏董事長（香港大公文匯傳媒集團董事長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家早上好！很高興出席今天的領航「9+2」·第六屆粵港澳大灣區發展論壇暨頒獎典禮。首先，我感謝香港大公文匯傳媒集團，多年來透過舉辦論壇，凝聚各界力量，為推動大灣區高質量發展集思廣益、建言獻策。我也要恭喜所有得獎的朋友，期待你們繼續帶動更多、更大的力量，共建灣區新未來。

上個月，中共二十屆四中全會勝利閉幕。這次的全會，是在國家「十四五」規劃收官、「十五五」規劃謀篇布局的關鍵時間，召開的一次重要會議，這次會議的意義非常重大。

全會特別提出要促進香港、澳門長期繁榮穩定，充分體現國家對香港的高度重視和殷切期望。四中全會還提出要「優化區域經濟布局，促進區域協調發展」，「發揮重點區域增長極作用」，這些清晰指引，都與粵港澳大灣區的發展息息相關。

粵港澳大灣區建設是重大國家發展戰略，是香港融入國家發展的重點，也是本屆政府全面推進的重大工作。「十五五」規劃建議中有關區域發展、特別是粵港澳大灣區建設的重大部署，將為特區政府指明未來的工作方向。

過去數年，在國家的大力支持下，粵港澳三地攜手努力，在推動大灣區建設取得豐碩成果。一系列政策相繼出台，促進基礎設施「硬聯通」、規則機制「軟聯通」和人員往來「心聯通」，加快區域一體化進程。

香港在「一國兩制」下，擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢。我們通過發揮內地與國際之間的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」角色，不斷強化「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台功能，為大灣區實現高質量發展注入香港力量。

今年九月發表的《施政報告》，提出多項深化大灣區合作的措施，全面推動區域融合發展。香港正處於轉型升級的階段，北部都會區將成為經濟增長與科技創新的重要引擎，以及香港與大灣區其他城市聯動發展的新平台。

《施政報告》提出加快北部都會區的發展，成立由行政長官親自領導的「北部都會區發展委員會」，發揮香港與內地的優勢互補，務求將北都打造成香港融入國家發展大局的重要門戶。

與此同時，特區政府會積極培育和發展本地的「新質生產力」，以創新科技推動高質量發展新格局。當中，河套香港園區將與深圳協同打造世界級科技創新重點平台，助力國家建設科技強國。

面對複雜而且不斷變化的環境，香港會繼續在國家發展藍圖中抓緊我們的優勢定位，繼續發揮「一國兩制」下的優勢，配合「十五五」規劃，把握大灣區機遇，推動高水平開放和創新。

讓我們團結一心，攜手並進，推動香港融入國家發展大局，為國家、大灣區和香港開創長期繁榮穩定、持續發展的美好未來。

各位嘉賓，各位朋友，香港的繁榮穩定需要每一位市民的共同建設。二○二五年立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日舉行，我呼籲廣大市民在當天踴躍投票，齊心為香港創造更好的未來！謝謝大家！"

Honourable Deputy Administrator Wang Qiming (Deputy Administrator of the National Railway Administration of the People's Republic of China), Dr Rex Auyeung (Chairman of MTR Corporation), Dr Ann Mills (Core Group Secretary of the International Railway Safety Council), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It's a great pleasure to welcome you to Hong Kong and the 35th annual conference of the International Railway Safety Council. Hong Kong last held this prestigious event in 2017, and we are delighted to welcome you back to Asia's world city.

  Hong Kong is committed to a sustainable, inclusive future built on international co-operation. We take pride in serving as Asia's premier gateway city, bridging people, commerce, education and culture across the region and around the world.

  Just last week, we concluded our annual Maritime Week. It attracted some 18 000 people from all over the world and featured more than 50 events, reinforcing our role as a global transport centre and premier hub for mega conferences and events.

  A key part of that role is integrated transport, and I'm pleased to tell you, we are strengthening the road connections that complement our rail network. Next month, on December 21, the Yau Ma Tei section of our new Central Kowloon Bypass will open. It's a dual, three-lane, 4.7-kilometre carriageway designed to bypass congested transport corridors and reduce peak-hour journey time between Yau Ma Tei and Kowloon Bay from 30 minutes to just five, thereby enhancing the entire transit system.

  This week, we are proud to host you, and this international gathering, counting more than 300 industry players from some 30 countries and regions. You are transport ministers and officials, railway safety regulators and operators, consultants, manufacturers and many other professionals devoted to the railway industry.

   As urbanisation accelerates and the demand for public transportation grows, expectations of speed, sustainability and service excellence continue to rise. Yet, at the heart of these demands, safety remains the bedrock of public trust – the foundation upon which railways drive sustainable development and prosperity.

  Which makes the theme of this year's conference, ""Advancing Railway Safety through Innovations and Collaborations"", particularly relevant.

  The Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government works closely with the MTR Corporation, one of the world's safest and most reliable railway operators, to develop innovative technology applications that enhance the operational efficiency and safety of our railways.

  Cross-boundary rail services between Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland entered a new era in 2018, when the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link began operations. Hong Kong is now seamlessly connected to the mainland's high-speed rail network, which spans over 48 000 kilometres, creating entirely new opportunities for travel, trade and economic integration.

  With 96 destinations accessible from Hong Kong's West Kowloon Station, and with streamlined immigration clearance procedures, the Express Rail Link has significantly enhanced passenger convenience, reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a regional logistics and transportation hub.

  The Greater Bay Area is central to Hong Kong's future and our deepening integration with the Chinese Mainland. The cluster city development counts 11 cities – nine in Guangdong Province, including Shenzhen, together with Hong Kong and Macao, and a collective population exceeding 86 million.

  Under the concept of developing ""Greater Bay Area on the Rail"", the Hong Kong and Shenzhen governments are collaborating on two cross-boundary railway projects, the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link (Hung Shui Kiu – Qianhai) and the Northern Link Spur Line.

  These cross-boundary railway projects will seamlessly connect the metro networks of Hong Kong and Shenzhen within a decade. And that will boost the Greater Bay Area's connectivity and bolster industry confidence in establishing operations here.

  The progress we are driving in the Greater Bay Area is built upon our country's, China's formidable capabilities. China has emerged as a global leader in railway development. Its high-speed rail network, now the largest and fastest in the world, is a testament to the country's technological innovation and operational excellence.

  Hong Kong supports our country's railway initiative and its mission to promote international connectivity, safety and innovation. And we are honoured to work with our mainland and global partners to advance railway development.

  We are formulating new ""Hong Kong Railway Standards"" by incorporating world-class specifications, including those of our country, aiming to serve as the Greater Bay Area standards and potentially new global standards, facilitating broader adoption of Chinese Mainland technologies and innovative methods in Hong Kong's railway development.

  Down the tracks, the railway industry faces numerous challenges, from maintaining safety standards to addressing cybersecurity and other emerging risks. While artificial intelligence, big data and other technologies offer transformative potential, they also demand vigilance and collaboration.

  This annual conference helps us identify and respond to those challenges, inspiring innovation and strengthening global partnerships.

  More than a mode of transport, railways serve as a powerful engine driving connectivity, resilience and progress. By prioritising safety, embracing innovation and deepening collaboration, I am confident that our industry will continue to enhance lives and connect countries and communities around the world.

  I am grateful to the organisers of this year's International Railway Safety Council conference, China's National Railway Administration, the Hong Kong SAR's Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and the MTR Corporation, for their dedicated efforts in making this event possible.

  I wish you all a rewarding conference and a memorable stay in Hong Kong. Make time, too, to enjoy our city, the world's rising East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. Thank you."

Fred (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Professor Frederick Ma), Minister Wang (Minister of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Mr Wang Qi), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. I'm pleased to welcome you to the Hong Kong Dinner in London, a longstanding tradition that celebrates the enduring ties between Hong Kong and the United Kingdom.

I'm delighted to be here, once again, for this good dinner and drinks among the best of company – from London and throughout the UK, from Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland, too.

Strong relationship with the UK

Our relationship with the United Kingdom has been growing from strength to strength. And without a whisper of extortionist tariffs to unravel, I'm happy to add.

Bilateral trade continues to flourish. UK exports to Hong Kong in the four quarters preceding June rose by 6.6 per cent, reaching 16.8 billion pounds. Hong Kong exports to the UK rose even higher – up a rousing 14.8 per cent over the same period, reaching 10.5 billion pounds.

  Investment ties are expanding, too. Next Tuesday, Hong Kong hosts the UK Investment Conference. The UK's growth priorities resonate strongly with our city's vision for development and strategic opportunities.

  Cultural exchange is also looking good and sounding great. Earlier this year, Coldplay performed a record number of sold-out shows at Kai Tak Sports Park, our new cultural landmark. And without a kiss-cam scandal.

  Four Premier League teams have also visited Hong Kong this year, each currently up there in the top ten, except Liverpool, which, surprisingly, trails behind Everton. But I have every confidence they'll bounce back soon.

  Beyond culture, sports and entertainment, our shared opportunities are sure to expand. And I'm happy to tell you why.

  It's been a challenging year for the global economy, for all of us. What with tariff numbers seemingly pulled out of a hat, then back in and out again. Despite these, and other bewilderments, I am pleased to report that Hong Kong is not only weathering the furies but has emerged stronger, more confident, more promising than ever.

The enduring strengths of ""one country, two systems""

  ""One country, two systems"" remains the cornerstone of our continuing prosperity. This has been repeatedly reiterated by President Xi Jinping. It's also reflected in the latest recommendations for the country's 15th Five-Year plan, which supports Hong Kong's singular global role.

  The common law system and rule of law continue to be a defining feature of our city. The latest World Justice Project rankings show Hong Kong maintaining its position. And we're once again ahead of several advanced economies, the United States (US) among them.

  A good number of Americans agree. In an American Chamber of Commerce survey, earlier this year, 83 per cent of its members expressed confidence in the rule of law in Hong Kong, up 10 per cent over two years ago.

  The US Congress said that's because some US companies had left Hong Kong. Well, we say more and more international companies are coming to Hong Kong. Last year, some 1 400 US companies were operating in Hong Kong, up 9 per cent, while 720 companies from the UK called Hong Kong home, a 12 per cent rise. This year, we are optimistic that more foreign companies will look to Hong Kong for their future.

And in the first nine months of 2025, the number of American visitors to our city rose 15 per cent, to more than 710 000.

  Obviously, American businesses and American people are smarter than their politicians.

  We continue to keep our tax system simple and low. Last year, we even reduced import duties on high-value spirits. No surprise, we've been enjoying more fine single malts lately - some of them even older than I am!

  Beyond the fundamentals, what sets Hong Kong apart is our resilience, agility and flexibility. These qualities are helping us navigate today's global challenges, including unilateralism, protectionism and tariffs.

  We all know these measures are unfair, unreasonable and unwelcome. But Hong Kong isn't responding to tariffs with more tariffs. We continue to uphold our status as a free port, with free flow of capital, goods, talent, and information. We stay aligned with international standards and best practices. Because we know that certainty, consistency and credibility are the foundations of long-term economic success.

  And that has proven to be rewarding. Hong Kong has become a destination for international investors seeking diversification with decent returns amid heightened policy uncertainty.

The financial market

  The facts speak for themselves. The Hang Seng Index has gained more than 30 per cent, year-to-date, following an 18 per cent rise last year. Average daily turnover has more than doubled, year on year. Our IPO fundraising this year is leading the world, reaching 21 billion pounds by October. Currently, 300 companies are waiting to be listed.

  The asset and wealth management industry is also flourishing. The total assets under management have reached some 3.5 trillion pounds.

  Bank deposits are up by over 10 per cent – now over 2.4 trillion US dollars. And that, I'm pleased to say, is more than two times Elon Musk's new pay package.

  Financial institutions are flocking to Hong Kong. They want to be closer to their investors and to the investment opportunities we're creating, day after day. Some fintech firms have even acquired entire buildings to house their expanding operations.

  The Financial Times once described Hong Kong's financial market rebound as a ""comeback with Chinese characteristics"". In truth, it is a comeback driven by global participation.

  Many cornerstone IPO investors for recent listings, for example, were top US and European funds and sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East, as well as institutions across Asia. For the stock market, international institutional investors account for about half the total trading volume.

The economy

  Our economy is also gaining momentum. We have registered GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth for 11 consecutive quarters. And just two weeks ago, we revised upward our GDP forecast for this year from 2 to 3 per cent to 3.2 per cent. That uptick is driven by robust goods and services exports, as well as rising private investment and consumption.

  Despite the protectionism, merchandise exports are growing at double-digit rates. Hong Kong has pivoted to new markets, strengthening its role in regional and inter-regional trade, particularly as a conduit between the Mainland and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), the Middle East and Europe.

  Tourism and events are back, and in a big way. Visitors are expected to reach 49 million this year, up more than 10 per cent. And Hong Kong is welcoming more visitors through our MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) events and year-round concerts, festivals and wine-and-dine attractions.

Finance

  Looking ahead, Hong Kong is brimming with opportunities. Let me touch on two of our major growth engines, finance, and then innovation and technology, as examples.

  For finance, let me highlight just four points – no spreadsheets, I promise.

  First, Hong Kong's super connector role is being enriched into a multidimensional platform. As China continues its high-level two-way opening up, Hong Kong is playing a pivotal role, helping Mainland enterprises go global - to the UK, Europe, and the Global South. A good case in point is CATL(Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited), the world's largest IPO (initial public offering) this year, which uses Hong Kong's fundraising and professional services to support its global expansion.

  At the same time, we're forging new partnerships with markets keen to tap into opportunities in the Mainland and across the region. Our ties with the Middle East and Southeast Asia are growing stronger.

  Over the past two years, we've collaborated closely with Saudi Arabia, launching reciprocal ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and enhancing regulatory cooperation. Just two weeks ago, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange welcomed its first-ever Middle Eastern listing - a significant milestone, hopefully the first of many.

  Central Asia is showing promise, too. The Kazakhstan Development Bank recently issued ""dim sum"" bonds totalling renminbi 2 billion, while a Kazakhstani company got listed on our exchange.

  Second, technology is empowering our capital markets. Nearly 60 per cent of our IPO proceeds this year come from new economy companies. This growth reflects the impact of listing reforms we've introduced since 2018, the most recent one smoothing the way for pre-commercial, hard-tech companies to get listed.

  Third, we're driving financial innovation. Hong Kong is becoming a global leader in digital assets and Web3 development. We've made steady progress in areas such as asset tokenisation, recently issuing the world's largest tranche of tokenised green bonds. It totalled 1 billion pounds. And yes, you may have heard of our licensing regime for digital asset trading and stablecoins.

  Fourth, we are building new growth sectors. This year, 12 metal warehouses in Hong Kong were approved by the London Metal Exchange, fuelling our vision as the region's commodity trading hub. And we're building a gold trading centre as well.

  At last year's dinner, I said we were gunning for London. Well, we may not have overtaken the City just yet, but I'd say we've moved a few Tube stops closer. And we're certainly not getting off at Earl's Court.

Innovation and technology

  Then there's innovation and technology.

  We're focusing our efforts on sectors where Hong Kong has a clear competitive edge: AI, biotech, fintech, and new energy and new materials.

  The Northern Metropolis, a strategic development area bordering Shenzhen, will play a critical role in realising this vision.

  We're accelerating its development, by easing planning restrictions and allowing for more flexible development models, including large-scale land disposals for high-impact projects. It will be where land use and industry developments are deeply integrated.

  And we're backing it with preferential policy packages to attract top-tier enterprises. These packages can include land grants, discounted premiums, tax incentives and other offers - all designed to make the Northern Metropolis internationally appealing. Think of it as the innovation district where your CFO and your CTO are both happy.

  At the heart of the Northern Metropolis lies the Loop Area along the Shenzhen River - a cross-boundary innovation corridor where capital, talent, goods, data - even bio-samples - will flow seamlessly from the Mainland to Hong Kong. For international biotech and AI companies, this will be a genuine game-changer – one of the few places in the world where Mainland and international data sets will meet and mingle.

Enterprises and talent

  To realise this vision, we need quality enterprises and a continuing flow of world-class talent.

  OASES, our Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, has brought in more than 100 high-impact tech companies over the past three years. Many are global leaders in their respective fields, such as AstraZeneca and GSK. Collectively, the companies will invest about 6 billion pounds in Hong Kong, creating 22 000 quality jobs.

  Attracting talented professionals is also a priority. Over the past three years, we have received over 550 000 applications and approved some 370 000. More than 250 000 individuals have already arrived, making a decided difference for themselves, their families and Hong Kong.

  And I invite more UK companies and professionals to join them – to join us – in Hong Kong, where we are building the future.

Hong Kong: seeing is believing

  Ladies and gentlemen, there's more. A great deal more to tell, but it's past dinner time.

  Let me leave you with just one important thought: whatever the headlines say, Hong Kong is best understood through facts and figures. Even the Financial Times last week held its inaugural forum on Hong Kong's revival.

  So I invite you to come and see for yourselves - today's Hong Kong. A city alive with arts and culture, sport and entertainment, and yes, fabulous food and drink, too. We are, after all, home to the best hotel and the best bar in the world.

  And if you need fresh air after a night of drinking, venture into our country parks and hiking trails - a dazzling and immersive world that leaves the financial district and city lights behind.

  Let me show you a little of that world now.

  Enjoy the Hong Kong Dinner and the great and good company all about you.

  And now, ladies and gentlemen, may I ask you to raise your glasses: let's drink to the enduring friendship between Hong Kong and Britain, Britain and Hong Kong.

  Cheers!"
財政司司長展開英國倫敦訪問（附圖／短片）,2025-11-26 09:30,2025-11-26 09:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/26/P2025112600172.htm,"財政司司長陳茂波當地時間昨日（倫敦時間十一月二十五日）抵達英國倫敦並展開訪問。

陳茂波昨天抵達倫敦後，與多家來自歐洲、中東和亞洲的家族辦公室的代表會面，向他們介紹香港在金融和創科方面的投資機遇、慈善和影響力投資的生態，以及優質的生活環境等，歡迎他們來港設立辦公室。此外，陳茂波也與一家有意在港來港設點營運的金融機構會面。

其後，陳茂波拜會了中華人民共和國駐英國特命全權大使鄭澤光，就香港未來的發展和中英關係等議題交換意見。

陳茂波晚上出席了由香港貿易發展局舉辦的「香港晚宴」，並發表主題演說，向英國的政商界介紹香港的最新情況和發展機遇。

陳茂波指出，香港與英國之間在過去一年在經貿、投資及文化等領域交流頻繁，雙邊貿易持續增長，雙向投資活躍。

陳茂波強調，「一國兩制」繼續是香港繁榮穩定的基石，法治和普通法制度依然穩健，廣獲國際認同。他指出，過去一年，全球資金持續流入、多國企業持續擴展在港業務，反映國際社會對香港營商環境的信心。例如，恒生指數繼去年上升18%後，今年累計上升約30%，首次公開招股（IPO）集資額更領先全球，資產管理規模及銀行存款亦持續增長，這些正面發展，都吸引了更多國際金融機構來港發展。

而在經濟方面，香港已連續11個季度錄得本地生產總值增長，全年經濟增長預測上調至3.2%。旅遊業和會展活動強勁復蘇，預計今年訪港旅客達4 900萬人次。

展望未來，陳茂波指出金融及創科將是香港兩大增長引擎。金融方面，香港正進一步發揮「超級聯繫人」的角色，協助內地企業走向全球，同時，積極拓展與中東、東南亞及中亞等市場的合作，推動互掛交易所買賣基金等，並加強監管合作。此外，科技亦正為香港資本市場注入動力，今年近六成新股集資來自新經濟公司，反映近年上市制度改革的成效。

與此同時，香港正發展為全球數字資產及第三代互聯網的領航者，最近亦成功發行全球最大規模的代幣化綠色債券，推動資產代幣化；在數字資產和穩定幣方面亦推動更多監管創新。此外，香港正積極拓展商品貿易市場，今年已有12個金屬倉庫獲倫敦金屬交易所認可，推動香港發展成為大宗商品貿易樞紐；同時也積極謀劃構建國際黃金交易中心。

創科方面，陳茂波指出，香港正集中發展具競爭優勢的領域，包括人工智能、生物科技、金融科技，以及新能源與新材料。在香港正積極引進高質素企業與世界級人才，過去三年，引進重點企業辦公室已成功吸引超過100家具影響力科技企業來港，包括英國阿斯利康（AstraZeneca）及葛蘭素史克（GSK）等全球領先的製藥企業。

陳茂波表示，北部都會區將成為推動創科發展的關鍵平台，特區政府正加快該區建設，包括放寬規劃限制，採用更具彈性的發展模式，例如片區開發，實現土地綁定產業的融合發展。特區政府也會推出優惠政策，吸引企業進駐。而深圳河套地區將成為跨境的創新走廊，推動創新政策，包括資金、人才、貨物、數據，以至生物樣本的自由流動，這些都對從事人工智能和生物科技的國際公司具相當吸引力。

陳茂波總結時說，香港的發展前景亮麗，歡迎更多英國企業及專業人士來港投資興業和發展事業，共享龐大的發展機遇。

陳茂波當地時間今日（倫敦時間十一月二十六日）會繼續在英國倫敦的訪問，稍後會轉往意大利米蘭訪問。"
Commissioning of Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section) to take place on December 21,2025-11-26 09:19,2025-11-26 09:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/26/P2025112600152.htm,"âThe Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Me Tei Section) (CKB (YMT Section)) will be commissioned on December 21 (Sunday).

The CKB (YMT Section) is a dual three-lane carriageway with a total length of 4.7 kilometres (km), including a tunnel of about 3.9 km long. The bypass connects Yau Ma Tei Interchange in West Kowloon to the Kai Tak Development Area and Kowloon Bay in East Kowloon, forming an important trunk road across central Kowloon. The western portal of the bypass connects to the Yau Ma Tei Interchange and provides access to Hong Kong (West), Kwai Chung, Lantau Island, Cheung Sha Wan, Yau Ma Tei and Tsim Sha Tsui via Hoi Po Road, West Kowloon Highway and Lin Cheung Road. The eastern portal connects to the Kai Tak Interchange, and motorists can travel via Shing Kai Road, Kai Cheung Road, Kai Fuk Road and Shing Cheong Road to and from Kai Tak Sports Park, Kowloon Bay, Kwun Tong Bypass and Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, etc.

Upon commissioning of CKB (YMT Section), traffic can bypass the busy central Kowloon area, significantly reducing travel time. During peak hours, the travel time from Yau Ma Tei to Kowloon Bay can be shortened from approximately 30 minutes to just about 5 minutes. CKB (YMT Section) will also alleviate the traffic burden on existing major east-west corridors (such as Lung Cheung Road, Argyle Street, Prince Edward Road West, Chatham Road North, Boundary Street, etc) helping to ease congestion. Neighbouring areas such as Wong Tai Sin, Ho Man Tin and Kowloon City will also benefit from this improvement and the road network efficiency in Kowloon will be significantly enhanced.

The CKB (YMT Section) is a large-scale project involving the construction of flyovers, drill-and-blast tunnel and underwater tunnel, with many challenges. Its alignment traverses bustling urban areas including Yau Ma Tei, Jordan, Kowloon City and Kai Tak, etc. In addition to reprovisioning of public facilities and temporary reclamation works, it also intersects with seven existing MTR Lines, which significantly increased the construction complexity. The project team proactively adopted innovative technologies and fostered the use of digitalisation in overcoming such challenges, while ensuring that the communities operated as usual and that the historic buildings nearby were protected during the construction.

The Highways Department (HyD) and its contractors are now at the final stage of works, including conducting final tests on systems and relevant drills. The HyD is also working with different departments and agencies (including the tunnel management company) to prepare for the commissioning of relevant road sections.

The HyD, together with the Transport Department and the relevant departments, will announce the detailed arrangements for the commissioning in due course."
中九龍繞道（油麻地段）於十二月二十一日通車,2025-11-26 09:19,2025-11-26 09:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/26/P2025112600150.htm,"​中九龍繞道（油麻地段）將於十二月二十一日（星期日）通車。

中九龍繞道（油麻地段）全長4.7公里，當中包括一段長約3.9公里隧道，採用雙程三線分隔車道設計，連接西九龍的油麻地交匯處與東九龍的啟德發展區和九龍灣，成為一條穿越中九龍的重要幹道。繞道西面出入口連接油麻地交匯處，駕駛者可經海寶路、西九龍公路及連翔道，來往香港（西）、葵涌、大嶼山、長沙灣、油麻地及尖沙咀等各區。至於東面出入口則接駁啟德交匯處，駕駛者可經承啟道、啟祥道、啟福道及承昌道，來往啟德體育園、九龍灣、觀塘繞道及啟德郵輪碼頭等。

中九龍繞道（油麻地段）通車後，交通可繞過繁忙的中九龍地區，顯著縮短行車時間。在繁忙時間，由油麻地前往九龍灣的車程可由約30分鐘縮短至僅約5分鐘。中九龍繞道（油麻地段）同時有助於減輕原有主要東西向交通走廊（例如龍翔道、亞皆老街、太子道西、漆咸道北、界限街等）的交通負荷，緩解交通擠塞。周邊地區如黃大仙、何文田及九龍城等亦可受惠，令整個九龍區的道路網絡效率得以大幅提升。

中九龍繞道（油麻地段）工程包括天橋、地底鑽爆隧道、海底隧道等多部分，規模浩大，挑戰重重。其走線貫穿油麻地、佐敦、九龍城及啟德等鬧市地段，當中除涉及重置公共設施和臨時填海工程外，更穿越七條現有港鐵綫，大大增加施工難度。工程團隊積極採用嶄新科技並推動工程數碼化，不但成功克服挑戰，也使推進工程期間，仍能確保社區的日常運作及保護鄰近歷史建築物。

現時，路政署及其承建商正進行最後階段的工作，包括系統最後測試及相關演練工作。路政署亦正與不同部門及機構（包括隧道管理公司）為開通相關路段作好準備。

路政署聯同運輸署及相關部門會於稍後介紹具體通車安排。"
