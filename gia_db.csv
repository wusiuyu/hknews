行政長官出席香港文化藝術界慶祝中華人民共和國成立76周年酒會致辭（只有中文）,2025-10-09 15:48,2025-10-09 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/09/P2025100900558.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十月九日）出席香港文化藝術界慶祝中華人民共和國成立76周年酒會的致辭：

李曙光副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室宣傳文體部副部長）、劉孝明主任（外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署辦公室主任）、許正中董事長（紫荊文化集團董事長）、霍震霆主席（香港文化藝術界國慶籌委會聯席主席）、區永熙主席（香港文化藝術界國慶籌委會聯席主席）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！非常高興出席今天的香港文化藝術界慶祝中華人民共和國成立76周年活動，與各位文藝界朋友聚首一堂，同賀國慶。

76年來，國家綜合國力實現歷史性跨越，全面建成小康社會，經濟高質量發展成效顯著。我國的文化事業繁榮興盛，中華優秀傳統文化得到「創造性轉化」和「創新性發展」，與現代生活相融相通，人民文化自信更加堅定，中華文化影響力更強大，令每一位中華兒女深感自豪！

習近平主席深刻指出：「文化是一個國家、一個民族的靈魂」。文化不只是歷史的載體，更是民族身分和價值觀的根基。中華五千年文明賦予我們堅定的自信，能夠在全球化的浪潮中堅守本源，同時以開放姿態與世界接軌，與時並進。

二十大報告明確指出，要不斷提升國家軟實力和中華文化影響力。在國家《十四五規劃綱要》的支持下，特區政府積極推動文藝發展，將香港發展成為中外文化藝術交流中心，充分發揮香港中西薈萃的獨特優勢，促進文明互鑑、民心相通。

事實上，香港近年在文藝發展方面取得長足進展。舉例而言，今年香港共有12個藝術項目成功入圍《國家藝術基金資助項目名單》，成績令人鼓舞。這些項目涵蓋大型舞台劇創作、傳播交流推廣、藝術人才培訓等多個領域，足證香港文藝界百花齊放、人才鼎盛。

我在上個月發表新一份《施政報告》，強調要繼續推動文化、體育和旅遊協同發展，為經濟注入新動力。我們會打造高端藝術品交易樞紐，推動西九文化區和本地文創產業多元發展，發展文藝旗艦品牌項目等。

其中，去年舉辦的首屆香港演藝博覽，吸引了60多個地區、逾1 600名文化領袖及藝術工作者參與，並舉辦過百場表演、講座和活動，促進跨國交流和合作，豐富本地文藝生態。政府會繼續發展這個品牌項目，把香港建設成為文化藝術創意交流、合作和推廣的樞紐平台。

政府亦會依據《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，與業界共同檢視文化藝術及創意產業的人力資源現況和未來需求，制定相應人才培訓策略，並為有志投身文藝創意產業的年輕人提供更多見習和培訓機會，持續擴充香港文藝人才庫。

我有信心，在各位文藝界朋友共同努力下，香港的文藝發展定會更加蓬勃。讓我們以文化之光點亮城市，以藝術之美潤澤社會，令香港在世界舞台上發光發亮，為實現中華民族偉大復興作出更大貢獻！

最後，我祝願祖國富強昌盛，香港文脈昌盛，各位佳作迭出。多謝大家！"

在《藍圖》的制訂工作方面，自藍圖小組委員會及其轄下三個工作小組在去年九月成立以來，已分別舉行多次會議以聚焦討論各項中醫藥發展議題。醫衞局中醫藥處亦與本地、內地及海外中醫藥業界人士和持份者進行了數百次交流活動。經整合各方意見，藍圖小組委員會已就《藍圖》中的具體中醫藥整體發展策略，以及長遠規劃的短、中和長期目標及可行方案，向發展委員會提出建議。

此外，香港中醫醫院和政府中藥檢測中心永久大樓的啓用籌備工作已經進行得如火如荼。兩個中醫藥發展旗艦機構於今年十二月起分階段投入服務後，將有助香港在中醫藥臨床服務、人才培訓和檢測標準等領域進一步發展。香港中醫醫院首年會提供門診及日間服務，並開展包括針對長者常見疾病的中醫專病服務（例如老年退化性疾病和中風後復康），為市民提供更全面的醫療服務選擇。

相關政府部門和機構代表亦在會議上向委員簡介《行政長官2025年施政報告》中提出其他中醫藥重要政策措施的最新進展，包括：

於今年十二月承辦「粵港澳大灣區中醫藥傳承創新發展大會」，匯聚粵港澳大灣區、內地及海外專家和持份者共同探討中醫藥高質量發展和未來方向。


盧寵茂教授說：「我在今年九月率領代表團到北京拜訪國家衞生健康委員會、國家中醫藥管理局和國家藥品監督管理局，介紹香港中醫藥發展的最新情況、《藍圖》的制訂工作，以及香港發展成為國際醫療創新樞紐等多項重要醫療政策的最新發展。行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》中提出多項有關中醫藥發展的政策措施，政府會繼續全力推動香港中醫藥高質量、高水平及全方位發展，發揮背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，助力國家推動中醫藥走向世界，為國家中醫藥發展作出貢獻。」

Secretary for Health chairs joint meeting of Chinese Medicine Development Committee and its three subcommittees (with photos),2025-10-09 15:47,2025-10-09 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/09/P2025100900486.htm,"The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, chaired the joint meeting of the Chinese Medicine Development Committee (CMDC) as well as its Chinese Medicine Practice Subcommittee, Chinese Medicines Industry Subcommittee and Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint Subcommittee (CMDBSC) today (October 9) to have in-depth discussions on the formulation of the Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint (Blueprint), preparations for the commissioning of The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong (CMHHK) and the permanent premises of the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute (GCMTI), as well as various policy initiatives relating to the promotion of Chinese medicine (CM) development set out in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"".

Professor Lo said, ""The year 2025 is a notable year for CM development in Hong Kong, signifying more breakthroughs, reforms and opportunities for CM development in Hong Kong. We will publish Hong Kong's first Blueprint by the end of this year. Meanwhile, the two flagship institutions for CM development, namely CMHHK and the permanent premises of the GCMTI, will also commence services in phases starting from December this year.""

On the formulation of the Blueprint, the CMDBSC and its three working groups have each held multiple meetings to focus on discussing various topics on CM development since their establishment in September last year. The Chinese Medicine Unit of the Health Bureau has conducted hundreds of exchange activities with stakeholders in the CM sector from local, the Mainland and overseas. After consolidating views from various parties, the CMDBSC has made recommendations to the CMDC on the concrete strategies for the overall development of CM, as well as the short-, medium- and long-term objectives and respective feasible initiatives for the long-term planning outlined in the Blueprint.

Professor Lo said, ""I would like to express my gratitude to members for their invaluable advice on policy initiatives relating to CM development. I look forward to the Blueprint, jointly formulated with members and stakeholders of the CM sector, mapping out the vision and strategies for the future development of CM in Hong Kong, thereby developing Hong Kong into a bridgehead for CM to go global.""

In addition, preparations for the commissioning of CMHHK and the permanent premises of the GCMTI are now in full swing. The two flagship institutions for CM development, with services to be commenced in phases from December this year, will be conducive to Hong Kong's further development in areas such as CM clinical services, talent training, and testing standards. In the first year, CMHHK will provide out-patient and day-patient services, as well as roll out CM services for special diseases, including degenerative diseases, stroke rehabilitation and other common diseases among the elderly, to provide the public with more comprehensive options for healthcare services.

During the meeting, representatives of relevant government departments and organisations also briefed the members on the latest progress of other major CM policy initiatives outlined in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"", including:


Promoting the sharing of electronic health records (eHRs) in the CM sector through eHealth, and further expanding the sharable scope of eHRs on eHealth between CM and Western medicine practitioners;
Advancing the development of the Integrated Chinese-Western Medicine services by expanding the Hospital Authority(HA)'s ""knee osteoarthritis""programme to all hospital clusters, and commencing the ""palliative care""pilot programme to provide palliative care services for patients suffering from conditions such as organ failure, thereby improving their quality of life; and
Hosting the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) Conference on Inheritance, Innovation and Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine in December this year to gather experts and stakeholders from the GBA, the Mainland and overseas to explore the high-quality development and future direction of CM.


Professor Lo said, ""I led a delegation to call on the National Health Commission, the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the National Medical Products Administration in Beijing this September to introduce the latest updates of various key healthcare initiatives, including the latest CM developments in Hong Kong, the formulation of the Blueprint and developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub. The Chief Executive put forward a number of policy initiatives on CM development in his 2025 Policy Address. The Government will continue to press ahead with the high-quality and high-standard development of CM in Hong Kong on all fronts, leveraging the unique advantage of enjoying strong support from the motherland and being closely connected to the world, with a view to assisting the national drive for CM to go global and contributing to the national development of CM.""

The Permanent Secretary for Health, Mr Thomas Chan; the Under Secretary for Health, Dr Cecilia Fan; the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam; Deputy Secretary for Health Mr Eddie Lee; the Project Director of the Chinese Medicine Hospital Project Office of the Health Bureau, Dr Cheung Wai-lun; the Director (Strategy and Planning) of the HA, Dr Ching Wai-kuen; the Hospital Chief Executive of CMHHK, Professor Bian Zhaoxiang, and representatives of the relevant government departments and organisations also attended the meeting today.

Established in 2013 and chaired by the Secretary for Health, the CMDC drives the direction and long-term strategies of the future development of CM in Hong Kong by providing recommendations to the Government in four key areas, namely the development of CM services, personnel training and professional development, scientific research and development, and development of the CM drug industry (including CM drug testing)."
Hong Kong Customs detects two smuggling cases involving ocean-going vessels with goods worth about $170 million in total seized (with photo),2025-10-09 15:47,2025-10-09 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/09/P2025100900550.htm,"Hong Kong Customs detected two suspected smuggling cases involving ocean-going vessels on September 18 and 26. Large batches of suspected smuggled goods with a total estimated market value of about $170 million were seized.

Through intelligence analysis and risk assessment, Customs discovered that criminals intended to use ocean-going vessels to smuggle goods. Strategies were thus formulated, and four suspicious containers scheduled to depart from Hong Kong to Southeast Asia via ocean-going vessels were selected for inspection.

Customs inspected two containers that were scheduled to be shipped to Indonesia and declared as carrying computer accessories and watch parts, and tally counters and computer accessories on September 18, and two containers scheduled to be shipped to Malaysia and declared as carrying refined lead on September 26. Upon examination, Customs officers found large batches of suspected smuggled goods, including laptop computers, watches, silver slabs, cameras, auto parts, batteries, integrated circuits and toys, in the four containers.

An investigation is ongoing. The likelihood of arrests is not ruled out.

Being a government department primarily responsible for tackling smuggling activities, Customs has long been combating various smuggling activities at the forefront. Customs will keep up its enforcement action and continue to resolutely combat sea smuggling activities through proactive risk management and intelligence-based enforcement strategies, and carry out targeted anti-smuggling operations at suitable times to crack down on relevant crimes.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

引進重點企業辦公室公布新一批重點企業　重點企業總數突破100家,2025-10-09 14:45,2025-10-09 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/09/P2025100900484.htm,"引進重點企業辦公室（引進辦）今日（十月九日）舉行新一批重點企業簽約儀式，歡迎多家重點企業在香港設立或擴展其業務。

簽約儀式由財政司司長陳茂波主持，歡迎18家重點企業落戶香港（詳見附件）。當中包括三家全球十大醫藥企業，也包括從事人工智能大型語言模型、自動駕駛技術、微電子領域、跨境金融服務的領軍者，以及具全球影響力的新媒體平台等。新一批重點企業不僅在港投資及創造就業機會，也會在本地設立區域總部及推展研發項目，助力香港創新樞紐的進一步發展。

隨着本批企業加入，引進辦的重點企業夥伴總數正式突破100家。這些重點企業合共預計為香港帶來約600億港元投資，並創造約22 000個就業職位，為經濟注入動能。

陳茂波致辭時表示，新一批重點企業除了帶來投資和就業機會外，亦為香港帶來更多的創新理念和先進技術，進一步豐富本地迅速發展的創科生態。

陳茂波表示：「重點企業可通過香港找到所需的資金、優秀人才、策略夥伴、完善的創科生態和聯通全球的合作網絡。香港與粵港澳大灣區城市的協作日益深化，為人工智能、生物科技和新能源等行業創造龐大的機遇。其中，河套深港科技創新合作區是合作亮點之一，將試行促進人流、資金、貨物及數據流通的創新政策。」

「引入更多結合創科的文創企業，是今年《財政預算案》中公布的措施。在文創知識產權（IP）與人工智能和第三代互聯網等新興技術的驅動下，全球數碼娛樂市場正蓬勃發展。香港憑藉與內地及世界的緊密聯繫、開放多元的文化，以及蓬勃的創科生態系統，是相關企業拓展亞洲乃至全球市場的理想平台。」

作為新一批重點企業之一，葛蘭素史克有限公司（GSK）表示，香港在粵港澳大灣區的地理優勢，使其成為連接中國內地的理想區域基地。GSK將充分利用此優勢，推動創新藥物註冊、運用大數據支援市場准入及公共醫療政策，並深化與本地科研機構及大學的合作。另一間新加入的重點企業羅氏，亦屬全球十大藥企。羅氏表示，「港澳藥械通」等政策措施為藥械產品提供有利的市場條件。政府亦積極支持羅氏在深港兩地開展科研合作，並於河套地區提供化驗實驗室服務，進一步彰顯香港在醫療創新及科研方面的獨特優勢和潛力。

引進辦主任任景信表示，新一批重點企業落戶在港，除了讓重點企業數目總數超過100家外，更成功吸引了三間全球十大藥企進駐，足以證明香港在創科及生命健康領域的國際吸引力。任景信補充，頂尖藥企的落戶與最新一份《施政報告》政策方向高度契合，將有助推動香港成為臨床研究及創新藥物開發的重要基地。新一批重點企業亦創下另一項紀錄，有高達40%的企業來自海外，反映香港作為國際大都會的吸引力持續增強，深受全球創科企業青睞。他強調，這充分印證香港在粵港澳大灣區中所扮演的國際創科樞紐角色，連接內地與全球市場，發揮「超級聯繫人」的獨特優勢。

引進辦將繼續積極吸引更多具有高潛力和代表性的重點企業在港設立和拓展業務，並與相關政府部門緊密合作，促進重點企業在港蓬勃發展，加快推動香港經濟升級轉型，進一步鞏固香港作為全球創新樞紐的定位。"

Mr Hui said, ""Rwanda is a participant in the Belt and Road Initiative. The CDTA demonstrates Hong Kong's continuous efforts in deepening co-operation with Belt and Road economies, and is also a significant milestone in promoting the financial, economic and trade connections between Hong Kong and Rwanda. This is the 54th CDTA that Hong Kong has concluded and is also the third one this year. The HKSAR Government will continue to expand Hong Kong's CDTA network to enhance our attractiveness as a business and investment hub, and consolidate the city's status as an international financial and trade centre.""

At the bilateral meeting, Mr Hui highlighted to Mr Murangwa Hong Kong's ""dual superpower"" as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"", and explored further collaboration to drive high-quality development along the Belt and Road together.

Mr Hui said, ""The CDTA sets out the allocation of taxing rights between Hong Kong and Rwanda, which will enable investors to better assess their potential tax liabilities from cross-border economic activities and enjoy avoidance of double taxation. This will be conducive to creating a more favourable and attractive business environment, thus promoting bilateral trade and investment.""
  
In accordance with this newly signed CDTA, Hong Kong residents can avoid double taxation in that any tax paid in Rwanda will be allowed as a credit against the tax payable in Hong Kong in respect of the same income, subject to the provisions of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112) (IRO).

Moreover, Rwanda's withholding tax rates for Hong Kong residents on dividends, interest, royalties and fees for technical services, currently at up to 15 per cent, will be reduced to 7.5 per cent to 10 per cent.

The CDTA will come into force after completion of ratification procedures by both sides. In Hong Kong, the Chief Executive in Council will make an order under the IRO, which will be tabled at the Legislative Council for negative vetting. Details of the CDTA are available on the Inland Revenue Department's website (www.ird.gov.hk/eng/pdf/Agreement_Rwanda_HongKong.pdf)."

許正宇說：「盧旺達是『一帶一路』倡議的參與者。這份全面性協定既體現了香港持續深化與『一帶一路』經濟體合作的努力，亦是香港與盧旺達在促進金融和經貿合作方面的重要里程碑。這是香港簽訂的第54份全面性協定，亦是今年內的第三份。特區政府會繼續拓展香港的全面性協定網絡，提升香港作為商業及投資樞紐的吸引力，並鞏固香港作為國際金融及貿易中心的地位。」

在雙邊會議上，許正宇向Yusuf Murangwa部長闡述香港作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的雙重「超級優勢」，探討繼續深化合作，共同推動「一帶一路」的高質量發展。

許正宇說：「這份全面性協定闡明香港和盧旺達雙方的徵稅權，讓投資者更有效評估其跨境經濟活動的潛在稅務負擔及受惠於避免雙重課稅，有助締造更有利和具吸引力的營商環境，促進雙邊貿易和投資。」

  ""Each successful applicant will be issued with one Approval Letter and two Confirmation Letters. One Confirmation Letter is applicable to the HA's Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) Secondary Market, while the other is applicable to the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS)'s Flat-for-Sale Scheme (FFSS) Secondary Market. Within six weeks from the date of issuance, holders of Approval Letters may submit the Confirmation Letters to the HA and/or the HKHS for application for the Certificate of Eligibility to Purchase (CEP) to purchase a flat with the premium not yet paid in the HA's HOS Secondary Market or the HKHS's FFSS Secondary Market,"" a spokesman for the HA said today (October 9).

  ""The CEP is valid for 12 months from the date of issuance, and no extension will be granted upon its expiry. To complete the transaction, holders of the CEP need to apply for a Letter of Nomination from the HA or the HKHS after they have entered into a Provisional Agreement for Sale and Purchase (PASP). The applicant and the family member(s) named in the application form must meet the eligibility criteria of WSM 2024 from the submission of the application form up to the date of signing the PASP. Moreover, subsidized sale flats (SSFs) shall be occupied by the owner and all members of the family named in the Application Form for the purchase of the flat,"" the spokesman said.

  The list of successful applications will be uploaded tomorrow to the website for WSM 2024 (www.housingauthority.gov.hk/wsm/2024).

The HA has enhanced the mortgage arrangements for SSFs by extending both the maximum mortgage guarantee period and mortgage repayment period, allowing purchasers to have mortgage loans of longer tenure. The relaxation measures applicable to the secondary market have been implemented since March 1, 2024. Details are available on the website for WSM 2024.

SWD welcomes Ombudsman's direct investigation operation report,2025-10-09 14:22,2025-10-09 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/09/P2025100900337.htm,"âIn response to the direct investigation operation report on ""Respite Services for Supporting Carers of Elderly Persons and Persons with Disabilities"" released by the Office of The Ombudsman today (October 9), the Social Welfare Department (SWD) welcomed the investigation conducted by The Ombudsman. The SWD noted The Ombudsman's recognition of the Government's efforts and effectiveness in strengthening support for carers in recent years and expanding the respite service network. The SWD has accepted all the recommendations made by The Ombudsman and is actively taking follow-up actions, of which some have already been implemented or are currently in progress. The SWD will continue to strive for enhancements of respite services provided by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and private residential care homes for the convenience of people in needs.

The SWD has rolled out a number of innovative initiatives in recent years as well as improvement measures in response to the recommendations of The Ombudsman, adopting a multipronged approach to enable and encourage elderly persons and persons with disabilities to use respite services provided by the service units, including:

(1) Requesting all residential care homes for the elderly, residential care homes for persons with disabilities and day care centres/units to make use of their casual vacancies to provide respite services, as well as reviewing the distribution and utilitisation of respite places across districts in order to reallocate the quota of designated respite places;

(2) Reminding service units to update in a timely manner the information of the Vacancy Enquiry System for Respite Services/Emergency Placement, simplify the application procedures and not to impose additional examination items beyond the basic medical examination. Service units have also been requested to enhance training for frontline staff to provide more comprehensive and quality services to applicants. The SWD will continue to monitor the utilisation of respite services and take appropriate regulatory actions according to the established mechanism if any situation of non-compliance is noted;

(3) Organising visits and tasting programmes of respite services, which encourage carers to experience the services in advance, so that they can gain an understanding of the service and build confidence in the service providers, making it easier for the care recipients to become accustomed to the environment and use the services smoothly when needed. As at end-June 2025, more than 270 visits and tasting programmes of respite services were organised;

(4) Sustaining publicity efforts in encouraging carers to make good use of the 24-hour Designated Hotline for Carer Support 182 183 (the Carer Hotline) to match day or residential respite services for needy elderly persons and persons with disabilities. The number of case referrals made by the Carer Hotline for respite services has significantly increased from 18 in the first six months of its operation to more than 240 as at end-August this year; and

(5) Continuously expanding the respite service network by increasing the number of service points providing day respite services for persons with disabilities from over 40 to 70 in the past two years, and that for day respite service for elderly persons from 50 to over 300 across the territory, making it more convenient for elderly persons and persons with disabilities to use the services at their preferred location.

The Ombudsman has mentioned in the report that the average annual utilisation rates of designated residential respite places in some service units or districts are relatively low. The SWD explained that respite services are of a standby nature. Their actual demands are highly volatile and difficult to predict, making them different from general long-term residential care services. The rationale for the SWD offering more respite placements is to enable carers in matching with appropriate respite services when they have emergency needs. Considering the needs of carers to arrange temporary care for elders or persons with disabilities on ad hoc basis and the persistently high occupancy rate of long-term care places in residential care homes, the SWD set up designated respite places in some residential care homes across the territory to cater for the unexpected needs of carers. In the event of emergencies, such as the recent building power outages, typhoons or the evacuation of residents due to a wartime bomb-defusing operation, respite places have served the purpose in a timely manner of providing a temporary accommodation for affected elderly persons or persons with disabilities. As pointed out by The Ombudsman, the relatively low utilisation rates of residential respite places for persons with disabilities is due to fewer actual casual vacancies than expected. Under the existing definition and calculation method, the actual utilisation rates may have been underestimated. The SWD will consider The Ombudsman's recommendation on reviewing the calculation method of casual vacancies of respite places to better reflect the actual demand.

If members of the public need to use respite services, they can call the 24-hour Designated Hotline for Carer Support 182 183, where social workers will immediately refer them to respite service units and assist with applications for transportation subsidies, etc to alleviate the pressure of carers.

To enhance support for carers, the Chief Executive has announced in his 2025 Policy Address that the Government will earmark an annual recurrent expenditure of $500 million for launching a series of measures, including:

(1) expanding the Carer Support Data Platform by progressively connecting the data of more government departments and public organisations;

(2) upon learning from the Hospital Authority that a high-risk carer has been hospitalised, the SWD will arrange outreach to the care recipients and offer emergency support according to their needs;

(3) consolidating the data of the Hong Kong Housing Authority and the SWD to identify high-risk carers of elderly persons and carers of persons with disabilities, as well as singleton or doubleton elderly households lacking sufficient community support, and deploying District Services and Community Care Teams (Care Teams) to conduct visits;

(4) continuing the implementation of the District Services and Community Care Teams - Scheme on Supporting Elderly and Carers for three years by inviting Care Teams to actively provide support for and pay visits to high-risk families, and assisting households referred by Care Teams in installing and using the emergency alarm system as necessary;

(5) installing an intelligent accident detection system for 300 high-risk households;

(6) continuing the implementation of the Support for Carers Project for three years, with a view to providing training for frontline property management personnel in assisting carers in need; and

(7) enhancing the AI chatbot function of the Information Gateway for Carers.

The SWD will continue to take heed of the views of various stakeholders and motivate the sector to continuously enhance and promote respite services so that elderly persons, persons with disabilities and their carers in need will receive timely and suitable support."
Ombudsman announces results of direct investigation operation into respite services for supporting carers of elderly persons and persons with disabilities (with photos),2025-10-09 12:47,2025-10-09 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/09/P2025100900373.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

  The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (October 9) announced the completion of a direct investigation operation into the respite services for supporting carers of elderly persons and persons with disabilities, with 25 major recommendations for improvement made to the Social Welfare Department (SWD).

  In recent years, tragic incidents have happened from time to time when carers succumb to unbearable pressures. At least 15 injury or fatal incidents relating to carers have occurred in the past three years in Hong Kong. Cases involving ""the elderly caring for the elderly"", ""the elderly caring for the disabled"", and ""the disabled caring for the disabled"" are increasingly prevalent.

  Mr Chan said, ""Carers are the most important, or even the sole pillar, for many elderly persons and persons with disabilities. They have made invaluable contributions to their families and society, and should be recognised and supported by society. Each and every one of these tragedies is extremely shocking and heartbreaking. Respite services form an indispensable part of the support measures for these great carers, allowing them to take a break.

  ""The Office of the Ombudsman (Office) acknowledges and commends the current-term Government's efforts in strengthening the support for carers and the results, including innovative and effective measures such as introducing the 24-hour Designated Hotline for Carer Support (Hotline), setting up a one-stop Information Gateway for Carers, engaging the District Services and Community Care Teams to implement the Scheme on Supporting Elderly and Carers, and launching the Carer Support Data Platform for identification of and proactive follow up on high-risk carers. Regarding respite services, the current-term Government's efforts and achievements in expanding the service network are also praiseworthy.

  ""Respite services offered by service providers are directly or indirectly supported by public funds through different forms of government funding. Therefore, it is entirely legitimate for members of the public to expect these publicly funded providers to offer reasonable services to carers.

  ""Our direct investigation reveals two major problems. First, the service utilisation rates vary significantly across districts, and service distribution is uneven. Second, some service providers have a poor record of providing services, are suspected of being unduly selective in admitting applicants, and even create unnecessary obstacles for service applicants. They have certainly failed to live up to society’s expectations of fulfilling their mission of helping the needy.""

  Investigation Officers of the Office scrutinised information and conducted multiple covert telephone operations, calling the Hotline and 46 day care units and residential care homes disguised as carers to enquire about respite service vacancies, application procedures, ancillary facilities and fee structures. Eight site inspections were also conducted to understand the actual enquiry and application handling by different types of service providers and the Hotline.

  The Office found that the overall utilisation rates of respite services remained persistently low. In the past few years, the average utilisation rates ranged from only 50 per cent to 60 per cent for the elderly, and were even lower for persons with disabilities at only 10 per cent to 20 per cent. The utilisation rates of certain providers and districts are below 10 per cent, or are even at 0 per cent. Meanwhile, on the whole, utilisation rates varied significantly across the 18 districts. This reflects that the existing resources have not been fully or evenly utilised. Take day respite services as an example: in the past few years the average utilisation rates across the 18 districts ranged from 20 per cent to 138 per cent for the elderly, and from 4 per cent to 63 per cent for persons with disabilities. For districts with particularly strong service demands, carers will face huge difficulties in applying for the service, showing that the support for carers is still inadequate.

  The consolidated findings from covert telephone operations and site inspections revealed that many service providers will assess the physical and mental condition of applicants (i.e. care recipients) before deciding on whether to admit them, by requiring them to attend an in-person interview at the premises before submitting a formal application. For carers who need the services urgently, the requirement of a prior interview could frustrate and cause increased stress to them. Moreover, some service providers require applicants to undergo additional medical examinations at their own expense beyond the basic scope specified by the SWD. Such examinations could include a chest X-ray, blood and urine tests, physiotherapy and even mental health assessments, etc, which would create unnecessary obstacles and financial burdens for carers. The SWD currently permits service providers to impose extra requirements for medical examinations without clear regulations, and it is difficult to assess whether these extra items are necessary.

  The Office also encountered astonishing responses of some service providers during the covert telephone operations. Some refused to disclose vacancy availabilities to carers or even unreasonably rejected their applications for different reasons. Some declined applicants who wished to use respite services for only a few days, or only accepted application for use of respite services for months. Some declined applications on an urgent basis, claiming insufficient staffing to offer respite services, and requiring applicants to visit the premises in person and confirm its suitability before disclosing vacancies. The Office also encountered extremely unhelpful staff who failed to respond to enquiries and hastily ended the call after instructing the caller to consult social workers instead. Meanwhile, many service providers immediately replied that there were no vacancies when responding to telephone enquiries, contrary to the information displayed in the SWD's Vacancy Enquiry System for Respite Services and Emergency Placement (Enquiry System). During the Office's investigation, Hotline social workers shared that they encountered similar difficulties when using the Enquiry System for respite service matching.

  Furthermore, elderly persons and persons with disabilities are mostly frail and inconvenient to travel. They might even be wheelchair bound. When elderly carers accompany their family to respite service units, they might encounter immense difficulties in walking up or down the staircases or travelling by public transportation. They might give up respite service if they cannot afford taxi fare. The investigation revealed that very few service providers operate transfer services for users. It is noteworthy that the Hotline provides reimbursement of taxi fares on an accountable basis for callers in need, and even outreach services for escorting users to the respite premises. If promoted and expanded, such measures are beneficial to more carers, the elderly and persons with disabilities.

  Mr Chan said, ""Consolidating our findings, we cannot rule out that the low utilisation rates are partly attributable to the lukewarm attitude of some service providers, their improper handling of service enquiries and applications, suspected undue selection of applicants and even creation of unnecessary obstacles for service applicants, as well as not attaching importance to updating vacancy information in the Enquiry System.

  ""The mission of social welfare services is to alleviate poverty, support the disadvantaged and provide care for needy persons. The practitioners shoulder heavy responsibilities and society places high expectations on them. However, our investigation revealed that certain service providers did not fulfil their mission, as they disregarded the welfare of needy carers, elderly and persons with disabilities. The performance of these service providers is most disappointing. Such black sheep certainly failed to live up to society’s expectations and jeopardised the professionalism of the social welfare sector and the trust of our citizens.

  ""We must emphasise that all these service providers are subsidised by the SWD and are using public funds to provide services; this is not pro bono volunteer work. They have a duty to offer quality services to people in need, not to mention vulnerable groups in serious need of help. The SWD, as the regulatory authority, also bears an undeniable responsibility. Despite a strong demand for respite services, the utilisation rates of certain providers and districts are below 10 per cent, or are even at 0 per cent. The SWD and the service providers concerned should deeply reflect on the actual reason for the very low utilisation rates. In fact, some service providers with utilisation rates at 0 per cent had improved this immediately and even significantly raised their utilisation rates following supervision by the SWD, demonstrating that proactive efforts could yield tangible results. The Office considers it incumbent on the SWD to explore feasible measures to increase service providers’ proactiveness, and to strengthen service monitoring vigorously.

  ""Although the performance of some service providers was unsatisfactory, there are also service providers which are committed to serving people in need. The Office acknowledges and appreciates their contribution. I appeal to all in the social welfare sector to put forth their best efforts for the well-being of carers, improve respite services to share their burdens and relieve their pressure in a timely manner, prevent tragedies and benefit society.""

  Overall, the Office has made 25 major recommendations for improvement to the SWD regarding the operational arrangements for respite services, including application procedures, ancillary facilities and information provided for carers, service planning, utilisation and monitoring, and publicity and promotion. The Office is pleased to note that the SWD has accepted all the recommendations.

The Office's major recommendations for improvement to the SWD include:


request service providers to review the necessity for prior interviews with applicants, and encourage streamlining of application procedures as far as possible, such as conducting telephone or video assessments;




thoroughly review the current medical examination requirements imposed by all service providers; any providers requiring additional examination items beyond the basic scope must justify the necessity and obtain prior approval from the SWD;




explore jointly with service providers the establishment of a pre-registration mechanism under which carers can complete registration procedures in advance, and service providers can gain an early understanding of users’ conditions and level of care. Carers in need of services anytime can simply sign a declaration confirming that the situation has not changed, allowing them to obtain services at the shortest possible notice for emergency relief;




step up reminding service providers of their responsibility of the timely updating of vacancy information and other details in the Enquiry System, and enhance monitoring to ensure compliance;




encourage service providers currently operating a transfer service with their own vehicles to extend it beyond long-term care residents to also support respite service users as far as possible. For providers without their own transfer service, encourage them to proactively seek assistance from the Hotline for its social workers to offer transport assistance and an accompaniment service for users in need;




continue making regular spot checks by means of telephone investigations disguised as carers, and expand the scope to cover all types of service providers; make recommendations to any service providers with inadequacies found and implement monitoring measures;




based on the demand and utilisation patterns of different types of respite services, explore feasible measures to increase service providers’ proactiveness to offer respite services, thereby raising utilisation rates;




comprehensively review the distribution of respite service places to address the supply imbalance across districts; and




step up encouraging service providers to organise more experiential activities to help carers better understand respite services, boost their confidence, and allow elderly persons and persons with disabilities to adapt to the respite environment in advance.

社會福利署歡迎申訴專員公署主動調查報告,2025-10-09 12:32,2025-10-09 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/09/P2025100900231.htm,"​就申訴專員公署（公署）今日（十月九日）發表「支援長者及殘疾人士照顧者的暫託服務」主動調查報告，社會福利署（社署）歡迎公署進行有關調查，欣悉公署對政府近年加強支援照顧者及擴展暫託服務網絡的努力和成效予以肯定。社署接納並正積極跟進公署的所有建議，當中部分建議已落實或在進行中。社署會持續致力提升各非政府機構及私營院舍提供的暫託服務，方便有需要人士使用。

社署近年推出多項創新措施，並因應公署的調查結果而推行相應的改善措施，以多管齊下的方式便利和鼓勵長者及殘疾人士使用各服務單位提供的暫託服務，包括：

（一）要求所有安老院、殘疾人士院舍和日間護理中心╱服務單位使用其偶然空置名額提供暫託服務，並檢視暫託宿位在各區的分布和使用情況，重新調配指定暫託宿位在各區的名額；

（二）提醒服務單位必須按時更新「暫託服務／緊急住宿空置名額查詢系統」資料、簡化申請程序和避免在基本身體檢查以外施加額外檢查項目，並要求服務單位加強對前線員工的培訓，為申請人提供更全面的資訊及更優質的服務。社署會持續監察暫託服務的使用情況，如有服務單位未有按照相關要求，社署會按現行機制採取相應的執管行動；

（三）舉辦暫託服務參觀及體驗活動，鼓勵照顧者及早了解服務和建立對服務單位的信心，讓長者╱殘疾人士在有需要使用服務時更容易適應環境。截至本年六月底，社署共舉辦超過270場暫託服務參觀及體驗活動；

（四）積極宣傳和鼓勵照顧者善用24小時照顧者支援專線182 183（專線），為有需要的長者╱殘疾人士配對日間或住宿暫託服務。經專線轉介的暫託服務個案，由專線運作首半年18宗，大幅增至今年八月底超過240宗；及

（五） 持續擴展暫託服務網絡，提供殘疾人士日間暫託服務的地點於兩年間由40多個增加至70個，提供長者日間暫託服務的地點更由約50個大幅增至逾300個，遍布全港各區，讓長者和殘疾人士選擇方便他們的地點以使用服務。

公署在報告指出個別單位或地區的指定暫託宿位全年平均使用率偏低。社署解釋，暫託服務屬備用性質，需求較難預測、變化也較大，與一般長期住宿照顧服務的性質有別。社署在不同地區提供暫託宿位，是希望當有突發需要時，也能成功配對長者╱殘疾人士接受合適的暫託服務。考慮到照顧者不時需要安排長者或殘疾人士到院舍暫住，但各院舍的長期宿位入住率亦普遍偏高，因此社署在各區部分院舍設有指定暫託宿位，以備不時之需。在發生緊急事故，例如最近的大廈停電、颱風襲港以至移除戰時炸彈疏散居民行動，暫託宿位也起了及時的支援作用，讓受影響的長者╱殘疾人士暫住。至於殘疾人士住宿暫託服務的使用率偏低，如申訴專員所指，是由於實際出現的偶然空置宿位較預期少，而根據現行的定義及計算方式，實際使用率有可能被低估。社署會因應公署的意見，檢討偶然空置暫託宿位的計算方式，以反映實際需求情況。

市民如有需要使用暫託服務，可致電24小時照顧者支援專線182 183，由專線社工即時轉介暫託服務單位，並協助申請交通津貼等，以減輕照顧者的壓力。

為加強支援照顧者，行政長官已在二○二五年《施政報告》中宣布，政府會預留每年五億元的經常開支，推出一系列措施，包括：

（一）逐步連結更多政府部門及公營機構的數據，擴展支援照顧者數據平台；

（二）社署從醫院管理局得悉高風險照顧者入院後，會安排人員主動接觸他們的被照顧者，並按他們的需要提供緊急支援；

（三）整合房屋委員會和社署的數據，識別較缺乏社區支援的高風險護老者、殘疾人士照顧者和獨老或雙老住戶，並調遣地區服務及關愛隊伍（關愛隊）進行探訪；

（四）繼續推行「地區服務及關愛隊伍—支援長者及照顧者計劃」三年，邀請關愛隊主動關懷及探訪相關的高風險家庭，並協助獲關愛隊轉介的住戶按需要安裝及使用「平安鐘」服務；

（五）為300戶高風險住戶安裝智能意外偵測系統；

（六）繼續推行「與照顧者同行」計劃，並培訓前線物業管理人員，為有需要的照顧者提供協助，為期三年；及

（七）優化現有照顧者資訊網的AI聊天機械人功能。

社署會繼續聆聽不同持分者的意見，推動業界持續優化並積極推廣暫託服務，讓長者、殘疾人士及其照顧者獲得適時和適切的支援。"
LandsD extends coverage of 3D Indoor Map to all MTR stations,2025-10-09 12:00,2025-10-09 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/09/P2025100900165.htm,"The Lands Department (LandsD) today (October 9) extended the coverage of the 3D Indoor Map and the 3D Indoor Network to all MTR stations, providing more comprehensive spatial data to facilitate public travel.

The LandsD collaborated with MTR Corporation Limited to release the 3D Indoor Map of around 30 selected MTR stations in March this year, providing information on points of interest and a supporting indoor point-to-point pedestrian route planning service within the stations. The coverage of the 3D Indoor Map has now been extended to the entire rail network, covering all 98 MTR stations across 10 MTR lines, namely Airport Express, Disneyland Resort Line, East Rail Line, Island Line, Kwun Tong Line, South Island Line, Tseung Kwan O Line, Tsuen Wan Line, Tuen Ma Line and Tung Chung Line. The Map provides interior layout information of the publicly accessible areas within stations, such as levels, units, shops, points of interest and indoor routes.

To support point-to-point route planning, the 3D Indoor Network captures connections between different parts of the stations, linking facilities, shops, entrances and exits as well as interfacing with the outdoor 3D Pedestrian Network. Based on information stored in the 3D Indoor Map and the 3D Indoor Network, the system displays facilities and areas along routes and offers barrier-free route options.

The 3D Indoor Map dataset has been uploaded to the Common Spatial Data Infrastructure (CSDI) Portal (portal.csdi.gov.hk) for free download by the public. To support application development, the portal also provides multiple Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), including the APIs of the 3D Indoor Map of MTR stations and the 3D Pedestrian Route Search, together with sample codes demonstrating related functions. Members of the public can also browse the 3D Indoor Map and use the point-to-point route planning tool on the online application platform ""Open3Dhk"" (3d.map.gov.hk).

In addition, the LandsD launched the 3D Visualisation Map (non-textured models) in late September this year. The new dataset covers the whole territory of Hong Kong and consists of over 220 000 geometric models representing different types of ground features, including buildings and infrastructure. It has been uploaded to the CSDI Portal for free download by the public."

為支持點對點的路線規劃，三維室內路網記錄車站不同區域之間的聯繫，連接設施、商店及出入口，並銜接站外的三維行人道路網。系統會根據三維室內地圖及三維室內路網內的資訊，顯示沿路線的設施及區域，並提供無障礙路徑選項。

三維室內地圖數據集已上載至空間數據共享平台入門網站（portal.csdi.gov.hk），供公眾免費下載。為支援應用程式開發，該網站同時提供多項應用程式介面，包括港鐵站的三維室內地圖及三維步行路線搜尋服務應用程式的介面，並附有程式碼範例以示範相關功能。公眾亦可於線上應用平台「Open3Dhk」（3d.map.gov.hk）瀏覽三維室內地圖及使用點對點路線規劃工具。

此外，地政總署今年九月下旬推出了可視化三維地圖（無紋理模型）。新數據集覆蓋全港，包含超過22萬個幾何模型，用以標示不同地物，如建築物及基礎設施等，並已上載至空間數據共享平台入門網站，供公眾免費下載。"
​申訴專員公署公布就支援長者及殘疾人士照顧者的暫託服務的主動調查行動報告（附圖）,2025-10-09 12:00,2025-10-09 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/09/P2025100900339.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（十月九日）宣布申訴專員公署（公署）完成就支援長者及殘疾人士照顧者暫託服務的主動調查行動，並向社會福利署（社署）提出共25項主要改善建議。

近年，社會不時發生照顧者因不堪壓力而導致的倫常慘案。根據報道，單單在過去三年，全港發生至少15宗涉及照顧者傷亡的慘案。以老護老、以老護殘及以殘護殘的問題日益嚴重。

陳積志表示：「照顧者是不少長者及殘疾人士最重要甚至是唯一的支柱，他們對家庭及社會有極大貢獻，社會必須絕對肯定及支持所有照顧者。每次發生涉及照顧者的倫常慘案，都令人十分驚訝和痛心。暫託服務的目的是讓照顧者在極大壓力下得以暫時喘一口氣，是社會為支援這群偉大的照顧者措施中不可或缺的一環。」

「公署留意到，現屆政府大力加強對照顧者的支援，當中不乏嶄新和有實效的措施，包括推出24小時照顧者支援專線（專線）、設立一站式『照顧者資訊網』、推行地區服務及關愛隊支援長者及照顧者計劃，以及建立支援照顧者數據平台，識別及主動跟進高風險照顧者，公署對今屆政府作出的努力及成果表示肯定和讚賞。就暫託服務而言，現屆政府擴展暫託服務網絡的努力和成效，亦應予以肯定。」

「暫託服務提供單位，都是透過不同形式的政府撥款，直接或間接獲得公帑而提供暫託服務，因此，市民絕對有權要求這些收到公帑資助的單位為照顧者提供合理及應有的服務。」

「是次主動調查行動揭示兩大問題。一，服務使用率差異極大，資源分配不均；二，部分服務單位不但欠缺積極，更涉嫌『揀客』、自設關卡、企圖阻撓照顧者申請服務，實在有負社會的重托，亦有違服務有需要人士的宗旨和精神。」

公署的調查人員除詳細審閱文件外，更進行了多次隱蔽電話偵查行動，以照顧者身分致電專線及46間提供暫託服務的日間服務單位及院舍，就暫託服務空缺、申請程序、配套及收費等方面提出查詢，亦進行了八次實地視察，深入了解各類服務單位及專線處理查詢及申請的實際操作情況。

公署發現，暫託服務整體的使用率長期偏低，在過去數年，長者暫託服務的平均使用率只介乎50%至60%，殘疾人士暫託服務的平均使用率則明顯更低，只有10%至20%左右。個別單位、地區的服務使用率更低於10%，甚至是0%。同時，整體而言，18區的使用率差異極大，例如長者日間暫託服務，18區的平均使用率在過去數年由20%至138%不等，殘疾人士日間暫託服務則由4%至63%不等，反映現有資源未獲充分利用的同時，還有使用極不均的情況。在需求特別大的地區，照顧者申請服務會更加困難，反映當局對照顧者的支援仍未做得到位。

綜合隱蔽電話偵查行動及實地視察的結果，不少服務單位均要求申請人在正式提出申請前親臨單位進行會面，以評估申請人（即被照顧者）的精神及健康狀況，才決定是否收納。如照顧者急需使用暫託服務，這些預先會面的要求無疑為照顧者添煩添亂，令他們更加徬徨無措。此外，有服務單位甚至要求申請人在社署指明的基本身體檢查以外，事先自費進行額外的醫療檢查，例如肺部X光、血液和尿液檢驗，以及物理治療甚至精神健康評估等，顯然為照顧者帶來不必要的關卡及經濟壓力。社署現時容許服務單位施加額外的醫療檢查要求，欠缺規範，亦無從評估這些額外檢查是否有必要。

公署在隱蔽電話偵查行動中，亦遇到部分單位令人震驚的回應，它們基於種種原因拒絕提供空缺資訊，甚至無理拒絕照顧者的申請，包括不接受申請人只使用數天的暫託服務，要使用服務數個月才會接受、以使用服務時間太急（如數天後）為由表示不安排服務、聲稱沒有足夠人手提供暫託服務，以及要求申請人須先前親身往單位視察環境是否適合，單位才會告知有否空缺。公署亦遇到單位的員工態度相當冷淡，沒有回應查詢，只着公署職員自行向社工查問便匆忙掛線。與此同時，很多單位在回應電話查詢時即時表示沒有空缺，但所有這些單位在社署的「暫託服務或緊急住宿空置名額查詢系統」（系統）上均顯示仍有空缺。在調查期間，專線社工亦曾與公署分享，在使用系統進行暫託服務配對時遇到同樣困難。

另一方面，長者及殘疾人士大多體弱和行動不便，甚至需要用輪椅出入，年老的照顧者帶同被照顧者前往暫託服務單位，不論上落樓梯還是乘搭公共交通工具，都會遇到極大困難，有經濟困難的可能會因為的士費用昂貴而放棄使用暫託服務。可是，甚少服務單位提供院車服務接送暫託服務使用者。值得一提的是，專線現時會為有需要的來電者提供實報實銷的的士交通津貼，甚至會透過外展服務上門接送使用者前往服務單位。公署認為，若將服務推廣，更多照顧者和被照顧者將可受惠。

陳積志認為：「綜合調查所得，公署認為，目前暫託服務的使用率偏低，不能排除的原因包括，部分單位對提供服務冷漠和欠積極，甚至不當處理服務查詢及申請，涉嫌選擇性收納申請人，更加自設關卡，以及沒有認清更新系統空缺資料的重要性。」

「社福服務的天職，是扶貧助弱、關愛有需要的人士，可謂任重道遠，社會對業界有很大期望。可是，公署調查發現，部分單位並不重視和履行它們的使命，置極需支援的照顧者及老弱人士的福祉於不顧。調查顯示部分單位的表現確實令人非常失望，這些害群之馬實在辜負社會的重托，亦有損社福界的專業及廣大市民的信任。」

「公署必須指出，所有服務單位均接受社署的資助，是來自市民的公帑，不是義務工作，有責任為有需要的市民提供優質服務，更何況是極需照顧的弱勢社群，而社署作為監管一方，亦責無旁貸。社會上對暫託服務極有需求，但個別單位、地區的服務使用率低於10%，甚至是0%。社署及有關單位必須深切反省使用率極低的實際原因。事實上，部分使用率為0%的服務單位，經社署督導下，使用率隨即有所改善，甚至大幅提升，足以證明事在人為。公署認為，社署必須制定可行措施，增加服務單位的積極性，並大力加強監察。」

「雖然調查顯示部分服務單位表現未如理想，但亦有不少單位認真用心為有需要人士服務，公署對他們的貢獻表示肯定和讚賞。我呼籲社福界一同為照顧者的福祉作出最大努力，共同完善暫託服務，及時為照顧者分憂解難，防止悲劇發生，造福社會。」

整體而言，公署就暫託服務的運作安排，包括申請程序、提供予照顧者的配套及資訊、服務規劃及使用情況、服務監察，以及宣傳推廣，向社署提出共25項主要改善建議。公署欣悉社署接納公署提出的所有改善建議。

公署向社署提出的主要改善建議包括：

• 要求服務單位檢視與申請人預先會面的必要性，鼓勵單位盡量簡化申請程序，例如透過電話或視像形式進行評估；

• 詳細了解所有暫託服務單位現時對身體檢查的要求，如有單位在基本檢查以外施加額外的檢查項目，應提出理據並先獲得社署批准；

• 與服務單位探討制定預先登記機制，讓照顧者可以提前辦理登記手續，單位亦可提前了解使用者的狀況及護理程度，待照顧者隨時在有需要時，只要簽署聲明以證情況無變，便可在最短可行時間內獲取暫託服務，達到應急作用；

• 加大力度提醒服務單位務須按時更新查詢系統上的空缺或其他資料，並加強監察服務單位有否遵辦；

• 鼓勵現時已設有院車服務的單位，除接載長期護理服務的使用者外，亦盡量向暫託服務使用者提供交通接送服務。至於不設院車服務的單位，社署應鼓勵單位主動尋求專線協助，由專線社工為有需要的服務使用者提供交通援助及護送服務；

• 繼續定期進行抽樣電話調查，並擴展至包括所有類型的暫託服務單位。如發現單位表現不足，應提供改善建議及落實監察措施；

• 按各類暫託服務的需求及使用情況，研究制定可行措施增加服務單位提供服務的積極性，以提升使用率；
• 全面檢視暫託服務名額的分布，改善地區服務供應不均的情況；以及

• 大力推動服務單位舉辦更多暫託服務體驗活動，以加強照顧者對服務的認識和信心，並讓長者和殘疾人士預早適應暫託服務的環境。

"Hong Kong's higher education system achieves global recognition, showcasing success of education policy",2025-10-09 11:56,2025-10-09 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/09/P2025100900273.htm,"An Education Bureau spokesman today (October 9) said that, according to the World University Rankings 2026 just announced by Times Higher Education (THE), an international higher education organisation, University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universitieshave continued to hold top spots, rendering Hong Kong the only city in the world with five universities ranked among the global top 100, with all its ranked institutions gaining higher positions. The encouraging results fully recognise the achievements of Hong Kong's post-secondary education sector in its pursuit of and endeavour for excellence. They also serve as testimony to the Government's significant progress in developing Hong Kong into an international post-secondary education hub.

According to the latest THE World University Rankings, the University of Hong Kong rose two places to 33rd globally; the Chinese University of Hong Kong moved up three places to 41st; the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology jumped eight places to 58th; City University of Hong Kong advanced three places to 75th; and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University climbed one place to 83rd, staying among the world's top 100. In addition, Hong Kong Baptist University recorded an improvement in ranking, while the Education University of Hong Kong and Lingnan University entered the Rankings for the first time.

Among other parameters, Hong Kong demonstrated outstanding performance in several key indicators, with sustained progress in areas such as teaching reputation and staff-to-student ratio.

Hong Kong's post-secondary education is highly internationalised and diversified, with a pool of outstanding teaching and research talent. In the World Talent Ranking 2025 released by the International Institute for Management Development last month, Hong Kong leapt to fourth, ranking first in Asia. The latest THE World University Rankings reaffirm the remarkable achievements of the Government's education policy.

The spokesman said, ""Education is the foundation of building a strong nation and advancing national rejuvenation. Hong Kong has been aligning with the national strategy of building a leading country in education and developing itself into an international hub for post-secondary education and high-calibre talent. In recent years, the Government has launched a series of initiatives, including raising the admission quota for non-local students in publicly funded post-secondary institutions; increasing the quota for scholarships; striving to establish the Study in Hong Kong brand; and stepping up efforts to create favourable conditions for capacity expansion and quality enhancement of institutions.""

To further consolidate and leverage the strengths of Hong Kong's post-secondary education, the Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address that the Government will further relax the restrictions on admission of self-financing students; attract more international teaching and research talent and students; strengthen talent exchanges among the industry, academic and research sectors; anddevelop the Northern Metropolis University Town. These measures aim to boost Hong Kong's growth impetus and contribute more proactively to the country's development.

Following the Government's doubling of the enrolment ceilings for non-local students of UGC-funded universities from 20 per cent to 40 per cent from the 2024/25 academic year, the number of non-local students enrolled in the UGC-funded programmes has recorded double-digit year-on-year growth, with students coming from over 100 countries and regions. To support continuous capacity expansion and quality enhancement of the post-secondary education sector, on the premise of ensuring opportunities for local students to pursue further studies, starting from the 2026/27 academic year, the Government will raise the enrolment ceiling for self-financing non-local students for taught programmes of funded-post-secondary institutions from the level equivalent to 40 per cent of local student places to 50 per cent; and the over-enrolment ceiling of self-financing places of funded research postgraduate programmes will be increased from 100 per cent to 120 per cent. Moreover, the Government will establish the cross-departmental Task Force on Study in Hong Kong to further promote Hong Kong's higher education and quality resources in areas such as academic studies, scientific research and international co-operation to attract more students and scholars to study or conduct research in Hong Kong.

The spokesman added, ""These achievements fully showcase the effectiveness of the Government's continuous commitment to investing in education and proactively leading the post-secondary education sector in Hong Kong to expand capacity and enhance quality, seeking changes through innovation, as well as the support of a series of policy measures for building world-class universities and academic subjects. In the coming decade, along with the rapid education development of our nation, Hong Kong's education will also embrace a golden era. We will continue to deepen Hong Kong's role as an international hub for post-secondary education and a converging point of global talent, seize opportunities, and leverage strengths for contribution to the development of Hong Kong and the country."""

Peter (Director-General of the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, Mr Peter Yan), government colleagues, representatives of our valued strategic enterprises, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning.

  It is my great pleasure to welcome you all to the Signing Ceremony today, where the fifth batch of 18 strategic enterprises affirm their plans to establish or expand in Hong Kong.

  The enterprises joining us today represent a wide spectrum of cutting-edge industries - from leading global pharmaceutical firms to trailblazers in generative AI, autonomous driving, and microelectronics. They also include leading pioneers in new media and Web3 technologies.

  This is a significant milestone. With today’s addition, the number of strategic enterprises attracted to Hong Kong will surpass 100. Collectively, they are bringing in over HK$60 billion in investment and creating about 22 000 quality jobs. Beyond numbers, they also bring transformative ideas, world-class expertise, global perspectives, and a spirit of innovation that will further enrich our fast-evolving innovation and technology ecosystem.

  Today is special also because, for the first time, we are welcoming cultural and creative enterprises that integrate technology with artistry and entertainment. This is an initiative announced in this year’s Budget, and I’m delighted to see it becoming a reality . The global digital entertainment market is growing rapidly, powered by IPs, AI and Web3. Hong Kong - with our unique connectivity to both the Chinese Mainland and the world, openness and diversity as an international city, and a vibrant ecosystem in innovation and technology - is an ideal launchpad for these enterprises to grow and scale across Asia and beyond.

  To all the strategic enterprises joining us today: a very warm welcome to Hong Kong. I am delighted that you have chosen our city as your base for growth and further innovative breakthroughs. Here, you will find the capital, talent, partners, ecosystem and network that will help you succeed.

  The deepening collaboration between Hong Kong and the sister cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) also offers tremendous growth opportunities, particularly for those in sectors such as AI, biotech and new energy. The GBA is an innovation powerhouse that merges innovative strengths and advanced manufacturing capabilities. This year, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou science and technology cluster is ranked the world’s top innovation cluster by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

  A highlight of this collaboration is the Co-operation Zone between Hong Kong and Shenzhen along the Shenzhen River, known as Hetao or the Loop. This Co-operation Zone will serve as a testing ground for innovative policies, including the unimpeded flow of critical factors of production, including people, capital, goods and data.

  In this connection, Hong Kong’s appeal is clear. Take pharmaceutical companies for example. We are working to establish a primary evaluation mechanism for drug and medical device approvals. This will allow Hong Kong to independently review and approve drugs, medical products and devices developed in this zone, accelerating their time to the market. In Hetao, Hong Kong and Shenzhen have established cross-boundary clinical trial institutions, enabling studies that meet the regulatory standards of both jurisdictions. Together with other favourable government policies like talent, shared advanced laboratories and supercomputing power, Hong Kong is on the way to becoming a regional drug development hub.

  I’m pleased to note that some of you are already engaged in long-term collaborations with our medical schools and clinical trial institutions in the GBA, and I encourage you to explore more.

  Ladies and gentlemen, looking ahead, our efforts to attract strategic enterprises will grow in depth and breadth.

  Our goal is simple and clear: to bring more strategic enterprises to Hong Kong, so that we can have an even more vibrant ecosystem and a growing industry base to help our businesses and start-ups thrive, and to provide our people with more and better career opportunities.

  On that note, to our strategic enterprises here today, I thank you once again for choosing Hong Kong as your partner for growth. I wish you every success in your journey ahead.

  Thank you."

林主席（香港旅遊發展局主席林建岳）、劉局長（深圳市文化廣電旅遊體育局局長劉蕾）、各位嘉賓、各位同學和傳媒朋友：

大家好。

今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年，香港特區政府團結各界舉辦了一系列的大型紀念活動，讓全港市民包括我們的年輕一代以及來自不同地方的旅客，通過這些紀念活動，認識中國人民在爭取和平進程中所展現的團結和堅韌精神，增強家國情懷。

為加深市民和旅客對香港抗戰歷史的認識，行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》提出會推廣以「中國文化名人大營救」歷史為主題的紅色體驗研學新路線。今日由香港旅遊發展局及深圳市文化廣電旅遊體育局合辦的「中國文化名人大營救」香港深圳學習之旅，有來自四間學校，共一百多名的香港和深圳學生參與，亦標誌着這條研學路線的正式啓動。

這場被茅盾先生譽為「抗戰以來最偉大的搶救工作」，自一九四二年元旦開始，歷經六個多月的時間，先後營救了共800多名人士。行動中無一人被敵人截獲，無一人死傷。在這場艱鉅的秘密大營救中，香港及深圳兩地的通力合作，是營救得以成功極為重要的一環。同學稍後將在香港抗戰及海防博物館展開旅程。我們也十分感謝香港中國旅行社安排專業導賞帶領同學了解事件的前因後果、營救路線的決策，追溯當年的烽火歲月；接着會去到西貢斬竹灣烈士墓園，以及昔日大營救的指揮機關和接待站所在地的深圳中國文化名人大營救紀念館等，深入了解那場行動的周密與艱險。

透過這條寓教於遊的紅色研學路線，我們希望能夠讓廣大市民和旅客在實地走訪中，切身感受歷史的厚重和溫度，感悟愛國志士們捨生取義的英勇事蹟，從而更加深刻地認識到香港抗戰歷史。文化體育及旅遊局會繼續支持紅色研學旅遊的發展，與各界攜手開發更多結合歷史文化和旅遊體驗的項目，讓年輕一代在行走中學習，在體驗中感悟，將寶貴的精神財富轉化為建設香港、貢獻國家的強大動力。

我希望各位同學珍惜這次難得的學習機會，用心感受先輩們的崇高精神，將愛國情、強國志融入未來的學習與生活中，為實現中華民族偉大復興貢獻力量。

最後，我衷心祝願本次「中國文化名人大營救」香港深圳學習之旅活動圓滿成功，各位同學滿載而歸。謝謝大家。"

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-10-09 09:47,2025-10-09 10:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/09/P2025100900211.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 9) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

香港高等教育體系再度為港增光　彰顯教育政策成效,2025-10-09 09:14,2025-10-09 09:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/09/P2025100900184.htm,"教育局發言人今日（十月九日）表示，根據國際高等教育機構泰晤士高等教育（THE）剛公布的二○二六年世界大學排名，大學教育資助委員會（教資會）資助大學繼續位列頂尖，令香港成為全球唯一擁有五所大學躋身世界百強且所有上榜院校排名均有上升的城市，成績令人鼓舞，充分肯定香港專上教育界別精益求精、奮發圖強的成果，亦見證政府在建設香港成為國際專上教育樞紐上取得顯著進展。

根據最新THE世界大學排名，香港大學上升兩位至全球第33名，香港中文大學上升三位至第41名，香港科技大學上升八位至第58名，香港城市大學上升三位至第75名和香港理工大學上升一位至第83名繼續位列世界百強。此外，香港浸會大學的名次亦有所上升，而香港教育大學及嶺南大學則首次登上該排名榜。

當中，香港在多項關鍵指標均有亮眼表現，尤其在「教學聲譽」及「師生比」等方面表現持續提升。

香港專上教育高度國際化和多元化，並擁有優秀的教學及科研人才。在上月國際管理發展學院發布的《二○二五年世界人才排名》，香港躍升至第四位，成為亞洲之冠。是次THE世界大學排名亦再度印證政府在教育政策所取得的優異成果。

發言人說：「教育是強國建設、民族復興之基。香港一直積極配合國家教育強國戰略，建設香港成為國際專上教育樞紐及國際高端人才集聚高地。近年來，政府陸續推展一系列措施，包括提升政府資助的專上院校非本地學生限額，增加獎學金名額等；同時致力打造『留學香港』品牌，以及積極為院校擴容提質創造有利條件。」

為繼續鞏固及發揮香港專上教育的優勢，行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》中宣布將進一步放寬自資收生限制、招攬更多國際教研人才和學生、加強產學研人才交流，以及建設北都大學城等，以增強香港的發展動能，亦為國家建設作出積極貢獻。

自二○二四／二五學年政府將教資會資助大學錄取非本地學生限額由20%提升一倍至40%後，修讀教資會資助課程的非本地學生人數按年錄得雙位數升幅，其學生來自超過100個國家及地區。為支持專上教育界繼續擴容提質，由二○二六／二七學年起，政府會在本地學生升學機會不受影響的大前提下，將放寬資助專上院校授課課程招收非本地生的自費就學人數上限，由相當於本地學額數目的40%增至50%；資助研究院研究課程的超額收生自資學額上限，亦由100%增至120%。此外，政府會成立跨部門的「留學香港專班」，加大推廣香港專上教育及優厚的學術、科研和國際合作資源，吸引更多學生及學者來港就學或進行研究。

發言人說：「這些成就充分肯定政府持續堅定投資教育，並積極引領香港專上教育界通過擴容提質、創新求變、打造一流大學和一流學科等政策措施所取得的成效。未來十年，隨着國家教育高速發展，香港教育亦將迎來黃金時期。我們會繼續深化香港作為國際專上教育樞紐和人才集聚的角色，抓緊機遇，發揮優勢，為香港和國家的發展貢獻力量。」"

Hong Kong Customs raids two suspected illicit cigarette storage centres (with photos),2025-10-08 18:33,2025-10-08 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800663.htm,"Hong Kong Customs today (October 8) detected two illicit cigarette cases and raided two suspected illicit cigarette storage centres in Kwai Chung and Kwun Tong. About 350 000 suspected illicit cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $1.6 million and a duty potential of about $1.2 million were seized. Three persons suspected to be connected with the cases were arrested.

In the first case, Customs officers conducted an anti-illicit cigarette operation in Kwai Chung this morning and seized about 290 000 suspected illicit cigarettes inside a subdivided flat in an industrial building on Wo Yi Hop Road. A 33-year-old man and a 52-year-old woman, both claiming to be unemployed, suspected to be connected with the case were arrested.

In the second case, Customs officers conducted an anti-illicit cigarette operation in Kwun Tong in the same morning and intercepted a suspicious man in an industrial building on Hing Yip Street. Two thousand two hundred suspected illicit cigarettes were seized from his backpack, and the 62-year-old man, who claimed to be a transportation worker, was subsequently arrested. Later, Customs officers escorted the man to a mini-storage facility in the industrial building for a search and further seized about 61 000 suspected illicit cigarettes.

After preliminary investigations, Customs believed that the suspected illicit cigarette storage centres were primarily used to supply illicit cigarettes to areas in Kwai Chung and Kowloon East. Customs will continue to trace the source of the illicit cigarettes, and the likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

The three arrested persons were charged with ""dealing with goods to which the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance applies"". The two arrestees from the first case will appear at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (October 9). The arrestee from the second case will appear at the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts on November 10.

Customs will continue its risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as through its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storage, distribution and peddling to spare no effort in combating illicit cigarette activities.

Customs stresses that it is an offence to buy or sell illicit cigarettes. Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence.

首宗案件中，海關人員今日上午在葵涌進行反私煙行動，於和宜合道一座工業大廈的一個劏房單位內，檢獲約二十九萬支懷疑私煙。懷疑涉案的一名三十三歲男子及一名五十二歲女子被捕。二人均報稱無業。

第二宗案件中，海關人員同日上午在觀塘進行反私煙行動，於興業街一座工業大廈內截查一名形跡可疑的男子，並於其背囊檢獲二千二百支懷疑私煙，逐拘捕該名報稱運輸工人的六十二歲男子。其後，海關人員押解他到該工廈內的一個迷你倉進行搜查，再檢獲約六萬一千支懷疑私煙。

經初步調查，海關相信涉案的懷疑私煙貯存倉庫主要供應私煙予葵涌及東九龍一帶。海關會繼續追查私煙的來源，不排除會有更多人被捕。

三名被捕人士已被落案控以「處理應課稅品條例適用的貨品」罪，首宗案件的被捕男女將於明日（十月九日）在西九龍裁判法院提堂；第二宗案件的被捕男子將於十一月十日在觀塘裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據風險評估和情報分析從源頭堵截，並透過針對貯存及分銷販賣多管齊下的執法策略，致力打擊私煙活動。

海關強調買賣私煙同屬違法。根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-08 18:15,2025-10-08 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800665.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月八日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新個案資料

病人為十一歲男童，住所位於深水埗區。初步調查顯示，他於十月四日至七日到訪廣東省深圳市、佛山市和中山市，十月七日回港當日出現發燒及皮疹，由家人帶到廣華醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

病人的一名家居接觸者曾一同到廣東，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人於潛伏期身處廣東省，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得28宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-08 18:15,2025-10-08 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800661.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 8), one new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

âThe case involves an 11-year-old boy living in Sham Shui Po District. Preliminary investigations revealed that he visited Shenzhen, Foshan, and Zhongshan in Guangdong between October 4 and 7. Upon returning to Hong Kong, he developed a fever and rash and was taken by a family member to the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital for medical attention on October 7. He was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the Chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing.

A household contact of the patient had travelled with him to Guangdong and is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since the patient stayed in Guangdong during his incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 28 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
立法會：公務員事務局局長就《行政長官2025年施政報告》致謝議案辯論（第一節）致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-10-08 18:11,2025-10-08 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800657.htm,"以下是公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上就《行政長官2025年施政報告》致謝議案辯論（第一節：深化改革心繫民生、「一國兩制」行穩致遠、強化治理體系和粵港澳大灣區建設）的致辭全文：

主席︰

首先，我感謝李慧琼議員動議的致謝議案，亦感謝多位立法會議員對公務員事務提出的寶貴意見。

一直以來，公務員在參與制訂、推動和執行政策，以及為市民提供優質公共服務方面，都肩負重任。一支高效專業、竭誠服務的公務員隊伍，有助政府制訂惠民的政策以及政策成功落地推行。本屆政府自上任以來，致力推動政府治理體系改革。過去兩年，這些工作已得到一定的成果。在《2025年世界競爭力年報》中，香港在「政府效率」排名世界第二，反映香港公務員整體是一支優秀的隊伍，亦是本屆政府的改革和公務員共同努力的成果。

行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》提出一系列政策措施，以持續提升政府團隊落實執行政策的責任和效率。

《施政報告》就「進一步強化治理」有兩個重點項目。第一個是部門首長責任制。我感謝議員在各場合表達對建立責任制的支持，並就有關內容及執行提供了不少寶貴的意見。我想藉此機會向大家提一些重點。

首先，公務員一直以來都要為其工作績效問責，《公務員守則》已清楚說明這一點。部門首長亦一向要對部門的表現負上責任，只是政府一直未將有關責任整體制度化。行政長官提出建立部門首長責任制，不但可以清楚強調部門首長必須負責建立好管理團隊，帶領屬下高級公務員做好管理的工作，更可把司局長就制定政策須要政治問責和公務員就執行政策須要行政問責，兩者更好銜接起來，使兩者的角色更清晰。

部門首長責任制是通過要求部門首長承擔責任，推動部門首長建立有效的管理團隊和運作系統，亦強調高級公務員必須輔助部門首長履行管理責任，一層一層地做好對轄下人員的管理和督導工作。各層級的公務員都盡職履責，整個部門才可發揮最大效能。

責任制亦建立了固定機制，當部門的工作出現問題時，可按照問題大小輕重，清晰分為兩個級別處理：第一級調查機制會處理一些一般性質的問題，由部門首長進行調查。如部門出現嚴重問題，或涉及廣泛或重複性的系統問題，或有跡象顯示問題可能涉及部門首長的角色，有關局長可在獲得其所屬司長同意後啓動第二級獨立調查機制，由公務員敍用委員會進行獨立調查；司長亦可主動指示相關局長啓動調查機制。

公務員敍用委員會領導的小組會進行全面的調查，找出問題表象背後的成因。小組可因應需要邀請專家或不涉及被調查個案的政府人員參與調查；小組亦可調查任何級別公務員，並會涵蓋所有涉事的公務員和單位。剛才有議員對公務員敍用委員會表達一個憂慮，他們是否能夠真正做到獨立﹖其實，委員會歷任主席及成員行事均公正無私，過去亦就部門的紀律、招聘和晉升等政策及個案，作出不少的批評和建議，他們的公信力是毋庸置疑。

正如行政長官提到，責任制是讓部門首長履責「系統化、制度化、清晰化、肯定化、公平化、效率化」。我們會盡快草擬規例，以實行由公務員敍用委員會進行上述第二級的調查。公務員學院亦會設立部門首長／副首長主動領導培訓計劃，以加強他們的領導思維和部門管理能力。

另一個重點項目是強化公務員評核機制。人力是我們最寶貴的資源，我們必須發揮好公務員的才能，才可以進一步提升服務效率及效能。建立更嚴謹的評核機制，既可鼓勵優秀的公務員精益求精、提振他們的士氣；亦讓管方可針對性地協助工作能力不足的員工提升能力，和處理少數長期工作表現欠佳的人員。我感謝議員支持這個項目，亦分享了不同機構的做法給我們參考。我們會加以研究，並預計在二○二六年內推出措施，以更清晰地分辨員工的工作表現水平，從而進一步強化賞罰分明制度。

幾位議員剛才都提到，以往部分公務員有少做少錯、不做不錯、不求有功、但求無過的態度，亦都有人憂慮部門首長責任制及強化公務員評核機制，會否導致公務員因為怕犯錯、怕被問責而發展出這些態度。正如剛才政務司司長提到，公務員和政府部門現時的工作文化其實並不是這樣，例如部門是設有一系列的工作指標和服務承諾，部門亦會更加廣泛地應用科技，亦正在全力配合縮減公務員編制。公務員有清晰的使命和工作目標，工作是主動的、積極的，以及對市民的要求和需要是有高度的敏感度。現時的實況是不做一定錯，少做或者做不足他們的責任要求都是錯。

我們亦會為持續提升公務員的能力、擴闊其視野去強化公務員培訓。去年《施政報告》提出「政府治理人才培育計劃」，協助政府建立人才庫。公務員學院已在今夏推出這計劃，稍後會進行遴選面試。學員將會獲安排參加一連串多元化的培訓項目，部門或職系領導層亦會參與培訓與指導。

我們亦會積極推動愛國主義教育，協助公務員樹立正確的歷史觀，認清自身貢獻國家和香港發展的責任。另外，在中央政府的支持下，我們會選拔新一批優秀的青年公務員參與聯合國初級專業人員方案，前往聯合國辦事處任職，豐富公務員參與國際組織事務的經驗。另外，公務員事務局亦會安排有潛質的中高級公務員到海外院校進修。

主席，在行政長官帶領下，我們不斷深化改革，強化治理體系。我們會全力落實《施政報告》內有關公務員管理的各項措施，繼續精益求精，並以盡忠竭誠、砥礪奮進、敢於創新的精神，全力協助行政長官施政，積極服務市民，為國家、為香港的發展作出貢獻。

本人謹此陳辭，懇請議員支持議案。"

完稅標籤制度先導計劃旨在於實際操作環境中，透過模擬制度的運作流程及相關技術，以評估其效能及可行性，並讓業界及市民認識該制度的重點內容，以及提早作出相關合規準備。

海關人員會於先導計劃第一階段期間，在指定管制站內的海關課稅室，為由旅客帶入香港或以單一次付運方式進口香港、並已繳付全額稅款且未開封的每個香煙的零售封包，附貼試行完稅標籤。指定管制站包括落馬洲支線、港珠澳大橋香港口岸和香港國際機場指定貨運站。同時，海關亦邀請本地煙草製造商參與先導計劃，在擬於本地市場銷售的香煙的零售封包附貼試行完稅標籤。故此，一些已附貼試行完稅標籤的香煙將會在市場上供應。

試行完稅標籤的設計採用物理及數碼防偽特徵。海關人員及市民可使用指定管制站或香煙零售點所設置的專用儀器掃描試行完稅標籤上的加密二維碼，以確認相關香煙的完稅狀態。為方便識別，海關人員及本地製造商所附貼的試行完稅標籤分別為藍色和綠色。

先導計劃屬自願參與性質。香港海關歡迎市民以問卷表達對先導計劃的建議和意見。待完成中期評估後，香港海關會將先導計劃推行至更多邊境口岸的海關課稅室。"

Hong Kong Customs launched a three-month pilot run for the duty stamp system on October 6 and plans to implement the first phase of the system in the fourth quarter of 2026, followed by full implementation in the second quarter of 2027.

  The pilot run for the duty stamp system aims to simulate workflow and technology in practical operations to evaluate their effectiveness and feasibility, as well as to promote industry and public awareness of the key features of the system that enable them to prepare related compliance in advance.

  In the first phase of the pilot run, Customs officers at Duty Collection Offices of designated control points, namely the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port and selected cargo terminals of Hong Kong International Airport, will affix a trial duty stamp to each unopened retail package of cigarettes brought into Hong Kong by incoming passengers or imported for single shipments upon full duty payment. Meanwhile, local tobacco manufacturers are also invited to join the pilot run and affix trial duty stamps to retail packages of cigarettes intended for local sale. Therefore, cigarettes that bear the trial duty stamps will be supplied on the market later.

  The trial duty stamps are designed to bear both physical and digital anti-counterfeiting features. Customs officers and members of the public can scan the encrypted QR code on the trial duty stamp using dedicated devices available at the designated control points or retail outlets to ascertain the duty-paid status of the cigarettes. For easy identification, trial duty stamps affixed by Customs officers and local manufacturers are respectively in blue and green colours.

  Participation in the pilot run is voluntary. Hong Kong Customs welcomes the public to give suggestions and views on the pilot run throughquestionnaires. After the mid-term evaluation, Hong Kong Customs will extend the pilot run to more Duty Collection Offices at various control points."

主席、各位議員：

首先，我感謝內會主席就《行政長官2025年施政報告》提出致謝議案。

我會先就維護國家安全的議題發言，然後會就其他與保安範疇相關的議題作扼要回應。

維護國家安全

在維護國家安全方面，今年六月三十日是《香港國安法》公布實施五周年的重要里程碑。我感謝立法會於去年全票通過、制訂了《維護國家安全條例》，完成了特區就《基本法》第二十三條立法的憲制責任。在二○二五年五月刊憲生效的兩項根據《維護國家安全條例》訂立的附屬法例，以及我們剛向政府人員發布的《政府人員維護國家安全工作指引》，都是特區的重要工作成果。現時，《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》和香港特區其他維護國家安全的相關法律已經築牢了香港特區在維護國家安全方面的屏障。

除了法律制度和執行機制外，我們會持續全力防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，做到有法必依、執法必嚴、違法必究。

同時，我們會繼續以多管齊下的策略，將宣傳推廣和教育工作做得更深更廣。

在這方面，特區政府在過去幾年已先後推出了國家安全展覽廳、國家安全地區導師、社區國安教育課程等。我們亦擴大了全港學界國家安全常識挑戰賽的規模，和推出了《安仔與熊仔》國家安全漫畫、動漫和實體繪本。

我們計劃用《安仔與熊仔》動漫系列作為藍本，公演國安話劇；亦會在本學年以短劇形式向小學生呈現。此外，約80名保安局青少年制服團隊領袖論壇義工會到幼稚園參與以《安仔與熊仔》為主題的工作坊，將國家安全的信息帶入幼稚園。

善用科技

AI、人面識別

今年的《施政報告》中，有效應用AI技術亦是施政重點之一。就此，保安局會積極配合這方面的工作。

其中，在推動「數碼警政」發展方面，警務處將會推出人工智能警務站，市民可以透過語音向智能虛擬警務大使作非緊急的報案。警務處計劃在二○二六年第二季，在港鐵中環站設置第一個人工智能警務站。

另外，香港海關亦計劃在二○二五年第四季，在羅湖口岸和落馬洲支線口岸引入「海關人工智能影像分析大數據系統」，利用人工智能科技，在各個口岸加強識別高走私風險的人士，令我們可以更精準地偵測到可疑的旅客和辨識犯罪集團，以及提升旅客的清關效率和執法成效。而在二○二七年年底前，海關會將整套系統逐步推展到其他口岸。

除了AI外，保安局亦積極運用其他科技，例如人面識別。入境處已經在二○二五年九月底，在機場入境大堂推出名為「容易飛」的e-道新功能，讓合資格的香港居民可以免登記、免出示旅行證件或者二維碼，在機場入境時以容貌識別技術核實身分和辦理入境手續。

入境處亦將會在港珠澳大橋香港口岸設立全港第一個「無感通關」試點，讓巿民透過人面辨識科技核實身分，實現不停頓過關。這是第一次在關口推行「無感通關」。入境處計劃在二○二六年第二季首先開放予已登記的香港居民作為先導計劃使用。

其他重點善用科技措施

另外，自從「銳眼計劃」推出、在罪案較多和人流較多的公眾地方安裝閉路電視以來，成效顯著。截至二○二五年八月三十一日，已經協助警方偵破了433宗案件，拘捕了787人。警務處將會進一步推展這個計劃，每年增加超過20 000支鏡頭，預計在二○二八年，有共約60 000支鏡頭覆蓋全港。

而為了向業主提供更好的消防安全改善工程支援，消防處將會在二○二五年年底前推行「物聯網火警偵測系統先導計劃」，以這個系統和滅火筒作為替代方案，讓六層或以下的目標樓宇無須裝設消防喉轆、消防水缸和水泵等消防裝置。先導計劃將會在10幢目標樓宇推行。

滅罪應急

除了上述的工作外，我們亦有多項滅罪應急措施。

打擊非法勞工

在打擊非法勞工方面，為了加大打擊的力度，我們已經成立了跨部門反黑工專責組，透過制訂應對非法勞工的整體策略、強化情報搜集和與內地情報交換、嚴厲執法、善用科技，以及協調相關宣傳和教育等方面加強跨部門協調。我們亦推出新的舉報非法勞工專線。自專線推出兩星期以來，入境處已經收到過百宗電話舉報。

政府嚴打非法勞工亦有助減低濫用免遣返聲請機制的經濟誘因。政府會繼續採取多管齊下的策略，以高效率處理聲請，盡快遣送聲請不獲確立的人離開香港，從而減低聲請人滯港而對社會所帶來的沉重負擔和安全風險。

「無人機警政」先導計劃

警務處亦會積極推行「無人機警政」。繼在今年五月在邊界警區和西九龍總區試行，警務處將會在今年內進一步擴展到在長洲分區和中區警區執行飛行任務，以提升巡邏效率。

便民利商

除了滅罪應急工作和善用科技之外，我們亦推出多項便民利商措施，以配合特區政府發展經濟。

開放邊境禁區

我們已經開放沙頭角海的禁區範圍，讓旅客可以申請禁區證遊覽；並將會在二○二六年年中取消米埔邊境禁區。措施實施後，除了過境設施和邊界巡邏路外，所有邊境禁區都會開放。

新建口岸實施「合作查驗、一次放行」通關模式

口岸方面，我們會繼續提升口岸基礎建設和通關能力。重建後的皇崗口岸將會實施「一地兩檢」安排，和採用嶄新的「合作查驗、一次放行」通關模式。我們會爭取在本屆政府任期內，讓這個口岸具備落成啓用的條件。至於沙頭角口岸項目則會用「跨河建」的安排重建，並實施「合作查驗、一次放行」的通關模式。這個口岸重建後將會成為純旅檢口岸。

說好香港

主辦多項國際會議和成立國際協會

我們亦會繼續說好香港故事。來年，我們會繼續舉行大型國際會議，包括二○二六年國際刑警組織周年大會，和應急與航空醫療國際研討會等。這些活動的目標是強化國際間的紀律部隊和專業團體的合作和交流。

結語

主席，以上是我對各位議員寶貴意見的扼要回應。來年，保安局會繼續帶領轄下的紀律部隊積極落實二○二五年度的《施政報告》中的各項措施。

主席，我謹此陳辭，請議員支持二○二五年度的《施政報告》。多謝大家。"

主席：

十分感謝李慧琼議員動議的致謝議案，以及各位議員在這個辯論環節所作出的發言和建議。我現在就《行政長官2025年施政報告》中有關堅定不移貫徹「一國兩制」方針、落實「愛國者治港」原則、推動愛國主義教育，以及深化粵港澳大灣區協同發展的政策範疇作出回應。

堅定不移貫徹「一國兩制」方針

國家主席習近平強調，「一國兩制」的根本宗旨是維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，保持香港長期繁榮穩定。「一國兩制」是香港回歸後保持長期繁榮穩定的最佳制度安排，必須長期堅持。「一國」原則愈堅固，「兩制」優勢愈彰顯。

特區政府會一如既往，全面準確、堅定不移貫徹「一國兩制」、「港人治港」、高度自治的方針，維護《憲法》和《基本法》確立的特區憲制秩序，貫徹落實經完善的選舉制度，全面落實「愛國者治港」原則。

落實「愛國者治港」原則

正如習主席強調，「把香港特別行政區管治權牢牢掌握在愛國者手中，這是保證香港長治久安的必然要求，任何時候都不能動搖。」

我們會致力確保在新選舉制度下的公共選舉均在公平、公正、誠實和安全有序下順利進行，讓市民選出愛國愛港、有志服務社會的人士進入管治體系，共同建設美好香港。

在完善特區選舉制度及地區治理體系後，我們已成功舉辦了六場重要的選舉。選舉委員會界別分組補選剛剛在今年九月七日順利舉行。整體投票和點票過程十分暢然有序，點票工作得以在兩個多小時內高效完成。我們會總結補選的寶貴經驗，繼續與選管會（選舉管理委員會）及選舉事務處以穩中求進的態度，持續優化選舉的各項流程和安排。

立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日舉行，我們正與選管會密鑼緊鼓進行各項相關籌備工作。我們亦會做好選舉宣傳，以及持續推廣經完善選舉制度的優越性和重要性，加強市民對選舉制度的認識，呼籲選民關心選舉，踴躍投票。

推動愛國主義教育

習主席又表示：「愛國主義是中華民族精神的核心。」「對每一個中國人來說，愛國是本分，也是職責，是心之所繫、情之所歸。」

特區政府高度重視在特區傳承和弘揚愛國主義精神，並決心構建以愛國愛港為核心、與「一國兩制」方針相適應的主流價值觀。「愛國主義教育工作小組」自去年四月成立以來已進行了大量卓有成效的工作，我們日後會繼續研究推出更多切合香港實際情況的愛國主義教育政策措施。

今年是抗戰勝利80周年。特區政府以「銘記歷史、緬懷先烈、珍愛和平、開創未來」為主題，推展一系列紀念和教育活動，傳承和弘揚偉大的抗戰精神，包括由行政長官率領的香港代表團到北京參加九三閱兵、特區政府舉行官方紀念儀式、行政長官向老戰士頒發由國家授予的紀念章，以及舉辦各種大型專題展覽等。

特區政府會繼續梳理及修繕保護全港各區的中共抗戰遺址，以及繼續推廣內地的愛國主義教育設施並將其納入特區愛國主義教育基地，鼓勵更多香港學生和青年到訪。同時，我們會與愛國團體建立密切關係，協同舉辦更多愛國主義教育活動。

此外，我們又會加強《憲法》和《基本法》的宣傳教育，加強市民對《憲法》、《基本法》、國家安全以及「一國兩制」的認識。

深化粵港澳大灣區協同發展

粵港澳大灣區建設是習主席親自謀劃、親自部署、親自推動的重大國家戰略。我們會錨定習主席提出的「一點兩地」新定位，使大灣區成為新發展格局的戰略支點、高質量發展的示範地、中國式現代化的引領地。

在中央的大力支持下，香港特區與其他灣區城市優勢互補，緊密合作，共建灣區高質量發展，一批批成功政策的出台亦大大促進了灣區的一體化進程，對香港企業和人才用好灣區機遇，以及推動大灣區各城市間的高水平融合發展，發揮了關鍵作用。

香港是大灣區中心城市和區域發展的核心引擎之一，在大灣區建設中肩負着引領帶動的重任。特區政府會積極與中央相關部委、廣東省政府及澳門特區政府保持緊密聯繫，繼續深化粵港澳三地的規則銜接和機制對接，促進人流、物流、信息流、資金流等重要生產要素在區內高效流動，爭取更多惠港利民、促進灣區融合發展的政策措施，助力國家進一步深化改革和高水平對外開放，積極融入國家發展大局。

特區政府亦會充分發揮香港在「一國兩制」下內聯外通的獨特優勢，擔當好「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的重要角色，致力發揮「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台關鍵作用，並會繼續說好灣區故事，對外宣傳推廣大灣區建設的重大機遇。

結語

主席，行政長官今年《施政報告》的主題是「深化改革、心繫民生、發揮優勢、同創未來」。行政長官強調，這份《施政報告》既是香港全力「拼經濟、謀發展、惠民生」、加快邁向「由治及興」的進程表，亦是香港主動對接國家發展戰略、實現突破新局面的策略部署。

我懇請各位議員支持《施政報告》，支持致謝議案，讓我們一起共同建設更美好的香港家園，同時為國家的強國建設和中華民族偉大復興作出新的更大貢獻。

主席，我謹此陳辭。多謝主席。"

主席：

感謝各位議員提出的寶貴意見。尤其多位議員對創新科技應用和相關的法律配套、支援內地企業出海、推動粵港澳大灣區法治建設等方面的工作表達支持。我想藉此機會作扼要回應。

（一）法律科技的推廣和應用

律政司一直致力推廣香港法律業界更廣泛地使用法律科技，促進法律科技在香港的發展及應用。

行政長官在去年的《施政報告》中提到的推動法律科技發展諮詢小組已於今年年初成立，成員包括法律界、學界及法律科技專家，協助政府制定法律科技政策，推動業界提升效率和競爭力。

在小組的協助下，我們以舉辦法律科技圓桌會議等活動方式，推動業界應用法律科技，提高業界對法律科技的認識，鼓勵法律從業員改變舊有思維。

此外，我們將於今年十二月舉行的香港法律周期間啓動首屆香港法律科技節，進行一系列推廣法律科技相關活動，包括本年度第四場壓軸的法律科技圓桌會議、介紹最新法律科技的展覽與現場演示等，務求與各位持份者共同探討法律與人工智能的融合領域及最新發展。

律政司已於今年九月中開展香港法律科技服務提供者問卷調查，以掌握國際市場上法律科技的最新發展，為日後推動法律科技的政策提供參考。

（二）檢視廣泛應用AI（人工智能）所需的法律配套

科技應用不單止有助提升法律界的效率，更是香港未來競爭力的關鍵因素。行政長官在今年《施政報告》中指出，政府會加大推動AI作為香港未來發展的核心產業，在重視防範安全風險的意識下推進AI+發展。

香港現時並無專門的法例規管AI。而AI的應用愈趨廣泛，政府有需要檢視相關的法律配套，讓政府在積極推動創科發展，鞏固香港領先地位的同時，保障社會不同持份者的合法權益。就此，我們會成立跨部門工作小組，協調政策局檢視更廣泛應用AI所需的法律配套。

（三）以香港法律及專業服務支援內地企業出海

《施政報告》明確香港要發揮出海平台作用，協助內地企業開拓海外新興市場。這樣做不但讓香港能夠貢獻所長，服務國家，同時亦為香港的經濟發展注入新的動力。行政長官已指示由我專責推廣香港法律服務，協同其他專業如會計、金融等，支援內地企業出海。

下一步，我們會聚焦法律和其他專業服務推廣，加強與其他部門和專業服務界別的協作，主動對接內地企業，整合專業服務提供者資訊，共同為內地企業提供出海專業服務，制定多元方案，發揮香港「走出去、引進來」的雙向平台作用。

（四）深化大灣區內法律合作

粵港澳大灣區是國家經濟發展的重要引擎，亦是香港未來發展的關鍵。深化粵港澳三地規則銜接與機制對接，是粵港澳大灣區建設的重要工作，亦是香港更好地對接國家戰略的把手。

建立大灣區仲裁員名冊

就此，律政司將推動粵港澳三地共同訂立大灣區仲裁員名冊，設立大灣區商事調解及仲裁平台，在大灣區各城市推廣大灣區調解、大灣區仲裁，落實灣區標準，加強規則銜接，通過資源共享降低企業跨境糾紛的解決成本。

律政司與廣東和澳門的法律部門亦已於今年正式發布及實施《粵港澳大灣區仲裁員名冊工作指引》，正進行各自的本地推薦程序，力求在今年內公布首批大灣區仲裁員名單。仲裁員名單能便利三地仲裁員在大灣區提供法律與爭議解決服務，為大灣區注入更多仲裁人才，為當事人提供更廣泛的選擇，推動大灣區非訴訟爭議解決機制的「軟聯通」。

粵港澳大灣區調解平台

粵港澳大灣區三地政府法律部門為促進調解工作設立了大灣區調解平台。大灣區調解平台已就三個範疇訂立了大灣區內共同採納的標準，包括《調解員資格資歷評審標準》、《調解員專業操守最佳準則》和《跨境爭議調解示範規則》。

去年十二月，粵港澳三地法律部門發布了統一的粵港澳大灣區調解員名冊。名冊上共有146名來自香港及廣東、澳門地區的調解員，其中經香港評審的大灣區調解員有49名。三地會於今年第四季再次進行粵港澳大灣區調解員本地評審，目標在今年內公布二○二五年大灣區調解員名冊，為大灣區的法律服務市場注入更多優質的調解人才。

大灣區律師聯會

另一方面，在司法部的支持下，我們將力爭在本年內設立大灣區律師聯會，加強支援大灣區律師的專業發展。大灣區法律資訊平台目前亦正有序推進，爭取明年上半年成立，促進灣區內法治信息的互通。

結語

主席，我們將繼續虛心聆聽議員的意見，與業界合作，推動香港法律服務業的發展。本人謹此陳辭，希望各位議員支持今日的致謝議案。多謝主席。"

主席：

在二○二五年《年施政報告》，行政長官指派我負責幾項跨部門督導、統籌和協調工作，當中包括領導人工智能（AI）效能提升組，推動部門善用科技提升政府效能，為市民提供更優質的政府服務。

AI效能提升組

成立AI效能提升組有三個目標：（一）統籌和指導各政府部門於工作中有效應用AI技術；（二）研究重組部門工作流程；及（三）推動部門進行科技革新，提升效能。透過這三方面的工作，我們會檢視部門現時的工作流程及科技應用，以新思維、新科技，使政府的工作能在科技創新的大環境下，與時並進，不論是處理政府內部的日常運作，還是為市民提供服務，都能提升效率、精益求精，讓政府的資源得到善用，及為市民在使用政府服務時，帶來更好的體驗，增加市民的獲得感和幸福感。

AI效能提升組會由我擔任組長，創新科技及工業局局長出任副組長，和數字政策專員為秘書長。小組亦會邀請一位業界代表擔任副組長，以引入市場思維及實務經驗。

AI的用途十分廣泛。政府部門日常的草擬、紀錄、處理查詢、收集數據、搜尋資料、資料共享、撰寫文案、處理登記、審批申請、制定工作重點名單、監察工作成效等工作，都可以考慮應用AI。重組工作流程亦可以藉着減省、調動工作程序，以至使用新的工作方法，令工作更順暢和更有效率。就此，AI效能提升組會主動檢視各部門主要業務的流程和科技應用，以提供針對性的AI應用、流程重組和數字轉型方案。

AI效能提升組會物色數個具影響力和擴展性的AI旗艦項目，加快公共服務革新，同時用作成功示範，推動其他部門進行同類改革。數字政策辦公室（數字辦）亦會提供AI工具箱，推動局／部門在數據分析、客戶服務及文書等日常工作上更廣泛應用AI技術。

我們會在下星期舉行第一次會議，商討AI效能提升組的工作計劃及時間表，並會向行政長官作出匯報。我們的目標是在二○二六年開展相關項目，包括在二○二六年內推出涵蓋100個政務環節的AI工具，以及在二○二六至二七及二○二七至二八年度內陸續推出AI旗艦項目。

在創新科技及工業局向相關事務委員會簡報《施政報告》措施時，有議員問AI效能提升組的運作與現時數字辦的工作有何不同。AI效能提升組是指導統籌的高層設計。在這設計下，AI效能提升組會從政府中央的高度就不同局／部門的科技應用和業務流程，給予指導和指示，提高政府運作和服務的效能，並促進跨部門的數據共享互用。另一方面，數字辦的性質和作用是專業的業務部門。AI效能提升組由數字政策專員擔任秘書長，是利用數字辦在業務流程重整、數字技術應用、創新科技項目管理等範疇的經驗，協助AI效能提升組統籌提升政府效能的工作，對部門給予切實可行的指導和指示，並向部門提供專業意見和協助。

在今日的致謝議案辯論，有議員提到推行哪些AI項目，應由中央評估，以避免部門揀一些容易做到而未必是市民最需要的項目去推行。也有議員提到，AI效能提升組要留意部門可能因行政差異、流程固化等原因對推行革新項目有抵觸情緒，令推行AI效能提升的工作遇到阻力。

我感謝議員的意見。正如我之前的發言所說，AI效能提升組是會主動檢視各部門主要業務的流程和科技應用，並提供AI應用、流程重組方案。所以AI改革工作的內容是由AI效能提升組制定。我們在作出決定時，必然會考慮項目所具的效益。再者，香港公務員團隊是優秀的，正如政務司司長所講，在今年六月瑞士洛桑國際管理發展學院的《2025世界競爭力年報》中，香港政府效率獲評為世界第二。我很有信心，各部門會忠誠和專業的推行AI效能提升組下達的指導和指示，而提升組亦會對部門給予適當的指導，釋除他們推行工作時遇到的一些困難，做到上下一心，為市民提供更舒心的服務。

我亦感謝議員就AI效能提升組工作提出的其他意見，包括：


建議政府參考鄰近地區在推動AI公務應用的經驗；
在確保安全的基礎上，加快豐富AI政務應用；
項目應以市民和企業為主要對象，並應致力做到一網通辦，盡量減低中小企的營運成本；
善用AI技術於勞工處求職配對工作；以及
以AI及大數據分析地區問題，以預早及從速作出部署。


這些意見都非常有價值，亦是AI效能提升組會商討的工作方向，我們會認真和詳加考慮。我謹此陳辭，懇請議員支持通過致謝議案。"
立法會十二題：公營醫療人手,2025-10-08 17:35,2025-10-08 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800348.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上謝偉銓議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

有意見指出，本港公營醫療系統面對人手短缺，前線醫護人員超時工作已成常態，有關情況影響員工身心健康及醫療服務質素。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，過去三年公營醫療系統的醫護人員的平均每周工作時數、超時工作時數、當值頻率及候召當值情況為何，並按職系列出分項資料；

（二）是否知悉，現時公營醫療系統的超時工作補償機制詳情為何；過去三年，各類醫護人員領取超時工作津貼或補償的人數，以及所涉及的金額分別為何；及

（三）為紓緩公營醫療系統人手不足（尤其是公立醫院醫護人員）的壓力，政府曾推行多項措施（包括引入非本地培訓醫療人才），有關措施的最新實施情況為何；如何透過「智慧醫療」及跨專業協作，以提升整體醫護人員效率？

答覆：

主席：

就謝偉銓議員的問題，經諮詢醫院管理局（醫管局）後，現綜合回覆如下：

香港擁有高水平的醫療專業和高效率的醫療系統，多項健康指標位居世界前列，為全球人均壽命最高（註一）而嬰兒死亡率最低的地區之一（註二）。二○二二至二三年度香港公共醫療衞生經常性開支相對本地生產總值的百分比只為4.1%（註三），與其他人口老化程度相若的經濟體比較，香港的相關開支比例屬於最低的地區之一，但已能提供全港接近九成醫療服務，並達致國際高水平的醫療質素，彰顯公營醫療系統的效率。

然而，香港醫療系統面對多項結構性挑戰。隨着人口長壽令香港整體人口高齡化，慢性疾病急速上升；優質而收費低廉的公營醫療服務吸引龐大服務需求，令醫療系統承受沉重壓力。有鑑於此，醫管局積極推行各項措施吸引及挽留人手，並應用資訊科技提升效率。

（一）根據醫管局現行政策，醫管局全體僱員的規定工作時數為每周總時數44小時。就員工當值安排，個別部門會按其運作需要編配。此外，超時工作是指僱員在規定工作時數以外的任何時間進行的工作，並一般以補假作償。醫管局並沒有就上述資料備存中央記錄，但個別部門會按運作需要備存超時工作時數記錄。就候召工作而言，醫管局設有候召補償定額酬金，以肯定醫生因工作性質需持續長時間工作的努力及貢獻。

醫管局一直密切監察人手情況，並在整體預算內持續推行多項措施以吸引、培訓和挽留人才，包括增加駐院醫生培訓名額以招聘本地醫科畢業生、招聘非本地培訓醫生以補充本地招聘工作、改善晉升機會以挽留員工、招聘兼職醫護人員（例如透過招聘自選兼職人員）、提供彈性全職工作安排、續聘合適的退休人員、優化購屋貸款利息津貼計劃，以及成立醫管局學院，以增加不同職系的培訓機會。

醫管局的人手情況持續改善。醫管局醫生的人手數目由二○○六至○七年度的4 617人增加至二○二三至二四年度的6 807人。醫管局醫生每周平均工時已由二○○六至○七年度（註四）的約55小時下降至二○二三至二四年度的約48.9小時，而每周平均工時超過65小時的醫生人數比例，亦由二○○六至○七年度約18%，下降至二○二三至二四年度約3.1%（註五）。同時，醫生的離職流失率由二○○六至○七年度6.3%，下降至二○二三至二四年度5.2%。

（二）有別於一般以補假形式補償超時工作的安排，醫管局亦設有特別酬金計劃，員工於正常工作時間之外自願提供服務，將獲發特別酬金，每小時金額按該員工現行基本薪金的1/140計算。計劃旨在緩解短期人手不足，並及時應對緊急情況，同時便於在特別項目下提供額外服務時數，以滿足運作需要。

以下各表羅列二○二二至二三、二○二三至二四及二○二四至二五年度醫療及護理員工獲發特別酬金計劃津貼的人數和涉及金額（註六、七、八）：

LCQ12: Manpower for public healthcare,2025-10-08 17:35,2025-10-08 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800367.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Tony Tse and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  There are views pointing out that with manpower shortages faced by Hong Kong's public healthcare system, it has become a norm for frontline healthcare personnel to work overtime and this not only affects their physical and mental wellbeing but also the quality of healthcare services. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the average weekly working hours, overtime hours, frequency of duty shifts and on-site call duties of healthcare personnel in the public healthcare system in the past three years, with a breakdown by grade;

(2) whether it knows the details of the current overtime compensation mechanism in the public healthcare system; the respective numbers of healthcare personnel of various categories who received overtime allowance or compensation, and the amounts involved, in the past three years; and

(3) of the latest status of the implementation of various measures (including the recruitment of non-locally trained healthcare professionals) introduced by the Government as an effort to alleviate the pressure arising from manpower shortages in the public healthcare system (particularly among healthcare personnel in public hospitals); how the efficiency of healthcare personnel as a whole can be enhanced through smart healthcare and multi-disciplinary collaboration?

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Hospital Authority (HA), the consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Tony Tse is as follows:

  With our high-quality healthcare professionals and highly efficient healthcare system, Hong Kong boasts a number of world-leading health indicators. We are among one of the regions with the longest life expectancies (note 1) and lowest infant mortality rate in the world (note 2). The public current health expenditures in Hong Kong only accounted for 4.1 per cent (note 3) of its Gross Domestic Product in 2022-23. Compared with other economies with a similar degree of population ageing, Hong Kong's related expenditure ratio is among the lowest. On the other hand, we were able to provide nearly 90 per cent of the city's healthcare services and achieve a high service quality on par with international standards, demonstrating the remarkable efficiency of our public healthcare system.

  Nevertheless, our healthcare system is facing various structural challenges. Longevity has led to an overall ageing population and a surging prevalence of chronic diseases in Hong Kong. Quality public healthcare services at affordable prices have attracted huge service demand, exerting immense pressure on the city's healthcare system. In light of the above, the HA is actively implementing various measures to attract and retain manpower, while leveraging information technology to enhance efficiency.

(1) Under the HA's existing policy, the conditioned hours of work for all employees are 44 hours gross per week. Regarding staff's rostering arrangements, individual departments allocate shifts according to operational needs. Furthermore, overtime work refers to any work undertaken over and above an employee's conditioned hours of work, and should normally be recompensed by time-off in lieu. The HA does not maintain centralised records for the above data, but individual departments maintain records of overtime hours worked due to operational needs. Regarding on-call duties, the HA provides the Fixed Rate Honorarium to recognise the efforts and contributions of doctors whose job nature requires sustained long working hours.

  The HA has been closely monitoring the manpower situation and has introduced a host of measures within the overall budget to attract, train and retain talents, including increasing the quotas of resident trainees to recruit local medical graduates; recruiting non-locally trained doctors (NLTDs) to complement the local recruitment; enhancing promotion opportunities for staff retention; recruiting part-time healthcare staff (e.g. through the recruitment of locum staff); providing flexible full-time working arrangements; rehiring suitable retirees; enhancing the Home Loan Interest Subsidy Scheme, and establishing the HA Academy to enhance training opportunities for different grades of staff members.

  The HA's manpower situation has been steadily improving. The number of doctors working in the HA has increased from 4 617 in 2006-07 to 6 807 in 2023-24. The average number of weekly working hours for HA doctors has seen a reduction from about 55 hours in 2006-07 (note 4) to about 48.9 hours in 2023-24. The proportion of doctors working over 65 hours per week has also fallen from about 18 per cent in 2006-07 to about 3.1 per cent (note 5) in 2023-24. Meanwhile, the attrition rate of doctors has also decreased from 6.3 per cent in 2006-07 to 5.2 per cent in 2023-24.

(2) Unlike the general practice of recompensing overtime work through time-off, the HA has also in place the Special Honorarium Scheme (SHS). Staff members who join the SHS outside normal work hours on a voluntary basis shall receive a special honorarium calculated at an hourly rate of 1/140 of their current basic salary. SHS aims to alleviate short-term staffing shortages and respond promptly to emergencies, while facilitating the provision of extra service sessions under special programmes to meet operational needs.

  The numbers of medical and nursing staff receiving payment for SHS and the amounts involved (note 6, 7, 8) for 2022-23, 2023-24 and 2024-25 are set out in the following tables:

2022-23

(3) Apart from recruiting local medical graduates, the HA also actively recruits NLTDs and engages professional healthcare talent through different global platforms for exchange programmes in Hong Kong. This serves to expand the talent pool of the public healthcare system so as to support the HA's service demands and development. As of August 31, 2025, a total of 330 NLTDs have worked or participated in exchange programmes within the HA. The HA has also earlier completed the indicator set out in ""The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address"" to ""have no less than 250 NLTDs working in the HA by end-2024"".

  Regarding the recruitment of non-locally trained nurses (NLTNs), subsequent to the passage of the Nurses Registration (Amendment) Ordinance in July 2024, the HA has launched a series of promotional campaigns to attract NLTNs from around the world to join the HA. In addition, the HA is actively developing nurse exchange programmes with various non-local partner institutions. As of August 31, 2025, a cumulative total of 324 NLTNs have practised or participated in exchange programmes within the HA.

  Meanwhile, the HA has been actively advancing smart healthcare by leveraging technologies such as AI, smart wards, smart clinics, smart support and digital workspaces to optimise the clinical and administrative workflows, thereby enhancing the healthcare service quality and operational efficiency. For example, the HA is strengthening the clinical application of AI to assist doctors in drafting medical reports, imaging analysis of Computed Tomography, and providing real-time interpretation services during patient consultations. Regarding smart wards, the HA utilises electronic displays and paperless workflows to provide real-time patient information and improve safety. As for smart clinics, specialist out-patients clinics and general out-patients clinics under the HA have in place the ""e-Vitals"" systems to enable patients to self-report vital signs data, thereby streamlining follow-up procedures and reducing data entry errors. As for smart support, the HA employs digital dashboards and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to enhance operational management, while deploying multifunctional robots to assist with administrative tasks, alleviating the workload of healthcare staff. Furthermore, the HA has established digital workspaces to facilitate multi-platform real-time communication, ward management and office automation as well as foster cross-departmental collaboration. These measures have improved efficiency, reduced patient waiting times and rationalised hospital admission processes.

Note 1: Provisional figures for average life expectancy at birth in 2024 were 82.8 for male and 88.4 for female.

Note 2: Provisional figures for the infant mortality rate in 2024 were 1.7 deaths per 1 000 registered live births.

Note 3: Excluding identified COVID-19 expenditures.

Note 4: The HA has maintained relevant data since 2006-07.

立法會十八題：在惡劣天氣下進行高風險活動,2025-10-08 17:25,2025-10-08 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800535.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上林琳議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見指出，儘管政府不斷呼籲市民在惡劣天氣情況下遠離危險區域，但仍有不少人不理勸告追風逐浪，該等行為不僅對自身生命安全造成嚴重威脅，亦加重政府救援部門的工作負擔和佔用公共應急資源。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去兩年，政府共收到多少宗市民在惡劣天氣警告信號（包括黃色、紅色或黑色暴雨警告，以及三號或以上熱帶氣旋警告）生效期間，無視政府呼籲進行高風險活動（例如追風、觀浪、游泳等）而遇險求助的個案；香港消防處及政府飛行服務隊展開就該等求助個案所進行的搜索及救援行動的平均成本為何；

（二）會否檢視現時法例，就市民在惡劣天氣警告下進行高風險活動的行為制訂明確罰則，例如就在暴雨警告信號生效期間進入高危地點（例如海邊、山澗、堤岸等）制訂嚴厲罰則，以加強阻嚇力；如會，具體詳情（包括時間表）為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）據報有家長在極端天氣下仍帶兒童前往高危區域，政府會否因應該等罔顧危險的行為，進一步完善有關照顧及看管兒童的法規，包括明確界定該等行為的違法性質及加強相關罰則；政府會如何透過家校溝通和社區親子活動等渠道進行家庭教育，提升家長群體在極端天氣下的安全意識？

答覆：

主席：

近年極端天氣越趨頻繁，每逢風暴來襲，政府均事先透過各種渠道提醒市民保持警惕，切勿冒險追風逐浪，又反覆呼籲市民遠離高危地點。惟仍有個別的人罔顧自身及家人的安全，帶同年幼子女前往海邊或高危地點追風逐浪，罔顧他們的安危。

政府強烈譴責颱風期間的追風逐浪等罔顧安全、極度自私的行為。追風逐浪的人往往低估風暴的風險，且過度高估自身逃生能力。這種極不負責任的行為不僅危及自身及子女安全，萬一遇到事故，更令拯救他們的救援人員置於極度危險境地。此等行為會增加公共救援服務的負擔，不當分散真正急需救援人士的資源，損害公眾利益。

救援部隊沒有備存相關開支的統計資料。

（二）政府高度關注並嚴厲譴責個別的人在惡劣天氣期間進行高風險活動，甚至帶同年幼子女前往海邊或高危地點觀浪的行為。警務處、康樂及文化事務署及漁農自然護理署具有現行法規規範相關危險行為，當中包括：


警務處可根據《侵害人身罪條例》（第212章）第27（1）條，如家長或負有照顧責任的人士帶同不足16歲的兒童或少年人前往追風致其生命可能受危害，可以「疏忽照顧兒童」罪將其拘捕；
警務處可根據《警隊條例》（第232章）第63條，如追風人士拒絕聽從警務人員的指示遠離岸邊及返回安全地方，可以「阻差辦公」罪將其拘捕；
康樂及文化事務署署長可根據《泳灘規例》（第132E章）第4（1）及（2）條，封閉泳灘禁止巿民進入或使用；
康樂及文化事務署署長可根據《遊樂場地規例》（第132BC章）第4條，封閉遊樂場地禁止巿民進入或使用；以及
漁農自然護理署署長可根據《郊野公園及特別地區規例》（第208A章）第13（1）至（3）條，封閉郊野公園禁止巿民進入或使用。


在近期超強颱風樺加沙襲港期間，警方嚴厲執法，包括進行三次執法行動，共拘捕四人，相關人士在颱風期間帶同年幼子女前往海邊或高危地點追風逐浪，涉嫌觸犯《侵害人身罪條例》的「疏忽照顧兒童」罪。另外，一名男子在已封閉的屯門黃金泳灘游泳，涉嫌違反《泳灘規例》規定，警方已向法庭申請傳票檢控該名人士。警方會積極跟進其他相關個案，適時發布相關執法及行動，以表明對同類行為的「零容忍」態度。

上述提及的執法行動已清楚表明政府對這些危害生命安全和不負責任的行為予以追究責任的立場。我們亦留意到社會有意見，希望研究從法律層面針對這些在惡劣天氣下追風逐浪的不負責行為，政府會通盤考慮並作研究。

（三）從超強颱風樺加沙襲港期間，警方有效引用《侵害人身罪條例》下的「疏忽照顧兒童」罪追究攜同子女或兒童觀浪的執法例子中可見，相關法例具備實際成效。而「疏忽照顧兒童」罪的最高刑罰為監禁10年，亦具相當阻嚇力。

為進一步提升家長及兒童在惡劣天氣情況下的安全意識及自律性，教育局會透過學校課程及全方位學習活動，包括在小學人文科指導學生認識天氣警告及惡劣天氣下的應變措施，及初中地理科涵蓋暴雨和颱風下的極端天氣狀況，讓學生識別有關危險警告訊號及需採取的預防措施，以培養其面對惡劣天氣時的判斷能力與責任感，以及透過「家長電子專遞」網頁向家長發放信息，提醒家長和學生在惡劣天氣下往返學校時應注意的事宜，並按需要通知學校，請學校向家長進一步轉達有關信息。康文署則與中國香港拯溺總會每年合辦「水上安全運動」活動，宣傳「顧己及人，切勿在惡劣天氣下進行水上活動」等信息，並舉辦多個外展活動，向中、小學生推廣水上安全的重要性，有關活動今年共有超過1 500名學生參加。消防處亦於二○二四年推出「消防處社區應急先鋒計劃」，透過講義和實體課堂教授防災應變、惡劣天氣應對及溺水、山嶺事故等自救知識，以提升市民應急能力與意識。該計劃已推廣至學校、社會團體及家教會等不同層面，截至今年八月三十一日，已有6 515名市民獲委任為該計劃的社區先鋒。

政府亦已善用電視宣傳短片及社交媒體平台等不同渠道，提醒市民在惡劣天氣下切勿追風逐浪，強調有關行為不僅對個人生命構成威脅，更可能違反相關法規，呼籲公眾必須保持警惕，共同維護公共安全。

政府將繼續加強執法，並從學校及社區層面入手，聯同社會各界加強相關宣傳，從源頭遏止惡劣天氣下的追風逐浪行為，以保障社會整體安全。"
LCQ18: Engaging in high-risk activities during inclement weather,2025-10-08 17:25,2025-10-08 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800537.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Nixie Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

There are views pointing out that despite the Government's repeated appeals for members of the public to stay away from dangerous areas during inclement weather, many people ignore such appeals and go storm-chasing. Such acts not only pose a serious threat to their own lives but also add to the burden of Government rescue services and deplete public emergency response resources. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the total number of cases received by the Government in the past two years where members of the public disregarded the Government's appeals and engaged in high-risk activities (such as storm-chasing, wave-watching, swimming) when inclement weather warning signals (including Amber, Red or Black Rainstorm Warnings, and Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals No. 3 or above) were in force, subsequently encountering danger and seeking assistance; the average cost incurred by the Hong Kong Fire Services Department and the Government Flying Service in conducting search and rescue operations for such cases;

(2) whether it will review the existing legislation to introduce clear penalties against the acts of members of the public of engaging in high-risk activities under inclement weather warnings, for example, imposing stringent penalties for going to high-risk locations (such as coastal areas, mountain creeks, and embankments) when a rainstorm warning signal is in force, so as to enhance the deterrent effect; if so, of the specific details (including timetable); if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as it has been reported that some parents still bring their children to high-risk areas during extreme weather, whether the Government will, in response to such reckless acts, further enhance the regulations concerning the care and supervision of children, including expressly defining such acts as illegal and stepping up the relevant penalties; how the Government will enhance parents' safety awareness during extreme weather through family education by means of home-school communication, community parent-child activities, etc.?

Reply:

President,

In recent years, extreme weather has become increasingly frequent. Whenever a storm approaches, the Government would remind members of the public in advance through various channels to stay vigilant and refrain from taking risks for wind-chasing and wave-watching, and repeatedly advise the public to stay away from high-risk locations. However, there are still individuals who disregard the safety of themselves and their families, and take their young children to the shorelines or other high-risk locations to chase winds and watch waves, imperiling their safety.

The Government strongly condemns wind-chasing and wave-watching behaviours during typhoons, which are selfish acts disregarding personal and public safety. Wind-chasers and wave-watchers often underestimate the risks of typhoons and rainstorms while overestimate their own ability to escape from danger. Such highly irresponsible behaviours not only endanger the safety of themselves and their children, but also place rescue personnel in extremely dangerous situations when accident occurs. These acts also unnecessarily increase the burden on public rescue services, unduly diverting resources away from those genuinely in urgent need of rescue, and thereby compromising the public interest.

In consultation with the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, the Education Bureau (EDB), the Environment and Ecology Bureau and the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, the consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Nixie Lam is as follows:

(1) The Fire Services Department (FSD), the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), and the Government Flying Service have been deployed for mountain rescue arising from camping, hiking and immersion incidents arising from swimming or surfing activities when Amber, Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signals, or Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals No. 3 or above were in force. Details of such cases between January 1, 2023 and August 31, 2025 are as follows:

The rescue teams have not maintained statistical breakdown of their operating costs.

(2) The Government is highly concerned about and strongly condemns the acts of individuals engaging in high-risk activities during adverse weather conditions, particularly those persons who bring young children to seafronts or dangerous locations for chasing winds and watching waves. The HKPF, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) currently have regulations in place to regulate such dangerous behaviours, which include:


Section 27(1) of the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212) stipulates that if any parent or individual responsible for care brings a child or young person under the age of 16 for wind-chasing or wave-watching activities in a manner that may endanger their life, such person can be arrested for the offence of ""neglect by those in charge of a child or young person"";
Section 63 of the Police Force Ordinance (Cap. 232) stipulates that if any individual refuses to comply with Police officer's order to leave the waterfront and return to safe location, such person can be arrested for the offence of ""obstructing a Police officer"";
Sections 4(1) and (2) of the Bathing Beaches Regulation (Cap. 132E) empowers the Director of Leisure and Cultural Services to close beaches, prohibiting members of the public from entering or using them;
Section 4 of the Pleasure Grounds Regulations (Cap. 132BC) empowers the Director of Leisure and Cultural Services to close pleasure grounds, prohibiting members of the public from entering or using them; and
Sections 13(1) to (3) of the Country Parks and Special Areas Regulations (Cap. 208A) empowers the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation to close country parks, prohibiting members of the public from entering or using them.


During the recent onslaught of Super Typhoon Ragasa, the HKPF took stringent enforcement actions including conducting three operations resulting in the arrest of four persons in total. These persons had brought young children to seafronts or dangerous locations for wind-chasing and wave-watching activities during adverse weather conditions, and were suspected of committing the offence of ""neglect by those in charge of a child or young person"" under the Offences against the Person Ordinance. In addition, a man was found swimming at the closed Golden Beach in Tuen Mun, suspected of contravening the Bathing Beaches Regulation. The HKPF had applied for summons to prosecute that person. The HKPF will actively follow up on relevant cases and will timely publicise enforcement actions to demonstrate the Government's zero tolerance stance towards such behaviours.

The above-mentioned enforcement actions have clearly demonstrated the Government's resolute stance on holding individuals accountable for the irresponsible acts endangering life safety. The Government has also taken note of the views in the community calling for a response, from the legislative perspective, to target the irresponsible wind-chasing and wave-watching behaviours during adverse weather conditions. The Government will take a holistic view in studying this issue.

(3) During the onslaught of Super Typhoon Ragasa, the HKPF effectively invoked the offence of ""neglect by those in charge of a child or young person"" under the Offences against the Person Ordinance to prosecute persons who brought children to wave-watching spots, demonstrating that the relevant legislation has delivered tangible results. The offence of ""neglect by those in charge of a child or young person"" carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment, which has a high deterrent effect.

To further enhance the safety awareness of parents and children during adverse weather, the EDB has integrated relevant learning into school curricula, including teaching instructions to be delivered in the Humanities curriculum in primary schools to familiarise students with various weather warning signals and relevant precautions to be taken. Additionally, the Geography curriculum of secondary schools also covers topics to introduce various extreme weather conditions, such as rainstorms and typhoons. These initiatives aim to familiarise students with various weather warning signals and the preventive measures to be taken, thereby nurturing their awareness and sense of responsibility during adverse weather conditions. The EDB would also disseminate messages to parents via its ""eBulletin for Parents"" website to remind parents and students of the matters they should pay attention to when travelling to and from school under adverse weather conditions. Where necessary, the EDB would also notify schools and request them to further convey the relevant information to parents. In addition, the LCSD and the Hong Kong China Life Saving Society jointly organise the Water Safety Campaign annually to promote messages such as ""Be considerate and refrain from engaging in water sports activities under adverse weather"". The LCSD also organises multiple outreach activities to enhance the awareness of primary and secondary students on water safety. This year, over 1 500 students participated in these activities. Concurrently, the FSD has launched the Fire Services Department Community Emergency Responder (FSDCER) Scheme in 2024. Through handouts and lectures, the public are equipped with self-rescue knowledge related to disaster preparedness, response to adverse weather conditions, drowning and mountain accidents, enhancing their emergency response capabilities and awareness. The programme has been promoted to various levels, including schools, social organisations and parent-teacher associations. As of August 31, 6 515 citizens have been appointed as FSDCER under this scheme.

The Government has also made full use of various channels, including TV Announcements in the Public Interest and social media platforms, to remind members of the public not to engage in wind-chasing and wave-watching activities during adverse weather conditions, emphasising that such acts not only endanger their personal safety but may also contravene the relevant legislation, and appealing to the public to stay vigilant and work together to safeguard public safety.

The Government will continue to step up law enforcement and collaborate with schools and community organisations to enhance publicity efforts, aiming to curb the wind-chasing and wave-watching behaviours under adverse weather conditions at source and safeguard overall public safety."
立法會七題：「盲盒」銷售模式,2025-10-08 17:20,2025-10-08 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800552.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上李浩然議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉近年一些商戶以「盲盒」（即消費者不能預先確認的商品內容）形式銷售產品的模式日趨常見，然而，該銷售模式亦引起消費者對其權益和未成年人影響的關注。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）在現行法例及規管框架下，當局有否就「盲盒」銷售模式進行規管；

（二）鑑於有意見認為，在「盲盒」銷售模式下，消費者更傾向追求未能預先確認「盲盒」貨品內容所帶來的刺激感及僥倖心理，而非「盲盒」貨品本身，政府有否評估「盲盒」銷售模式可能存在的賭博成分，以及其對未成年人的影響為何；

（三）據悉現時一些歐洲聯盟國家、新加坡及內地等均對「盲盒」銷售實施規管，當局會否研究參照上述國家的經驗，就「盲盒」銷售模式完善現行規管框架；

（四）據悉除了線下銷售的「盲盒」，消費者亦可以透過網上平台購買境外銷售的「盲盒」，當局有否評估現行條例及規管是否足夠防範境外銷售的「盲盒」可能涉及的避稅和違禁物等風險；及

（五）鑑於國家市場監督管理總局於二○二三年六月發布《盲盒經營行為規範指引（試行）》，當中特別制訂負面銷售清單，限制部分商品例如藥品、醫療器械及易燃易爆物品等不得以「盲盒」形式銷售，同時亦對化妝品和食品等關係到市民大眾健康的產品作出限定性表述，政府會否考慮相關做法，對關乎市民健康安全的商品的銷售手法進行規管？

答覆：

主席：

就問題的各部分，經諮詢民政及青年事務局、醫務衞生局、環境及生態局、保安局、財經事務及庫務局及香港海關（海關）後，現綜合回覆如下。

政府一直致力保障消費者權益，並十分重視在市面上銷售的產品的安全。就近年流行的「盲盒」，我們留意到有其他司法管轄區，包括內地，就相關銷售模式和產品安全性等作出規管。

香港現時有不同的法例保障消費者權益。其中，《商品說明條例》（第362章）禁止商戶對消費者作出不良營商手法，包括虛假商品說明、誤導性遺漏、具威嚇性的營業行為、餌誘式廣告宣傳、先誘後轉銷售行為及不當地接受付款。《商品說明條例》涵蓋貨品及服務，對實體及網上商戶的營業行為同樣適用。商戶如向消費者銷售「盲盒」時涉及上述不良營商手法，即屬違法。

海關是《商品說明條例》的主要執法機關，一直積極透過執法行動、合規推廣及推行宣傳教育，打擊不良營商手法，保障消費者權益。如發現有商戶涉嫌作出不良營商手法，海關會果斷執法。另一方面，消費者委員會（消委會）致力研究和倡導維護消費者權益的工作，包括處理消費者就貨品及服務作出的投訴。如消費者懷疑有商戶在銷售「盲盒」時，涉及不良營商手法，可向海關作出舉報或向消委會投訴。

此外，香港現時有不同的法例規管各類產品或物品的安全。任何人士向消費者提供相關產品或物品時，不論以任何形式、包裝和渠道銷售，均有責任確保其安全性符合相關法例要求。

就玩具產品方面，《玩具及兒童產品安全條例》（第424章）對製造、進口或供應本港使用的玩具的安全作出規管。《玩具及兒童產品安全（附加安全標準或規定）規例》亦訂明在本港供應的玩具，必須附有識別標記（即製造商、進口商或供應商的名稱和地址）及適用於該玩具的雙語警示或警告（即其安全存放、使用、耗用或處置的任何警示或警告）等資料。

就藥物（包括藥劑製品及中成藥）方面，現行法規旨在確保藥物的安全、品質及成效符合相關標準，以保障市民健康及安全。它們必須按《藥劑業及毒藥條例》（第138章）或《中醫藥條例》（第549章）註冊方可銷售，而所有註冊藥劑製品及中成藥必須於外盒包裝印有或附上與註冊詳情相符的標籤，清楚列明香港註冊編號、產品名稱、有效成分、製造商資料等。以「盲盒」形式銷售藥物可能違反相關法例。市民在選購藥物時，應詳細閲讀藥物包裝的標籤內容，切勿購買或使用成分或來歷不明的藥物。

就醫療器械方面，視乎有關產品的特性和特點，一些產品已受現行法例規管，包括《藥劑業及毒藥條例》、《消費品安全條例》（第456章）和《商品說明條例》等。市民在購買及使用醫療器械前，亦應充分了解產品，確保產品符合自身情況。政府正積極發展香港成為國際醫療創新樞紐，將於二○二六年內成立「香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心」，分階段實施「第一層審批」新藥註冊機制，並會提交規管醫療器械的立法建議，完善藥械監管法規。

就危險品方面，《危險品條例》（第295章）及其附屬法例規管危險品（包括爆炸品及易燃物品）的製造、貯存、運送及使用。商戶如以「盲盒」形式向消費者提供上述法例下所規管的危險品，必須遵守上述法例的規定。若「盲盒」內的物品為日常生活常使用及在零售商店常見的危險品（例如酒精搓手液、膠水等），而其盛載的容量不超過《2012年危險品（適用及豁免）規例》列出的最大包裝容量，則屬消費裝危險品，其包裝、標記及標籤等要求可獲豁免。

就食品方面，根據《公眾衞生及市政條例》（第132章），所有在香港出售的食物必須適宜供人食用。它們亦須符合上述法例下有關食物安全及食安標準的附屬法例。其中，根據《食物及藥物（成分組合及標籤）規例》，任何人在香港出售預先包裝食物，無論是否用「盲盒」形式出售，除非獲得豁免，否則所有預先包裝食物所加上的標記或標籤須以中文或英文，或中英文兼用，列出各項資料，包括保質期、特別貯存方式或使用指示的陳述、能量值及營養素含量等。

此外，在香港供應予私人使用的消費品，如不受其他法例規管，其產品安全受《消費品安全條例》及其附屬法例《消費品安全規例》規管。《消費品安全條例》規定製造商、進口商及供應商須確保其供應的消費品合符合理的安全程度；而《消費品安全規例》規定就消費品的包裝或標籤上的警示或警告，須以中文及英文表達，並且必須清楚可讀。

政府會繼續密切留意不良營商手法的趨勢和各類物品的相關安全標準的最新要求，從而制訂適切的應對策略，保障消費者的權益和安全。

另外，香港現時就禁運／受管制物品的進出口和應課稅品均有嚴格規管。相關規管適用於所有進出口模式，包括透過跨境電子商貿平台購入的物品。根據《進出口條例》（第60章），所有受管制物品（包括危險藥物、槍械、彈藥、武器、受管制化學品、藥品和動植物等）必須先獲得有關當局簽發的有效牌照或許可證，方能進出口。若沒有有效牌照或許可證而把任何受管制物品帶進／帶出香港（無論自攜、郵寄或經代購集運），除了涉案的物品會被充公，違例者也可遭檢控。在稅項方面，除了四類應課稅品（即酒類、煙草、碳氫油類及甲醇）須根據《應課稅品條例》（第109章）繳稅外，香港對其他進出口貨品不設任何關稅。任何人士如欲進出口應課稅品必須向海關申領有效許可證和作出申報。如欲在香港使用上述應課稅品，必須確保有關物品已完稅。"
"LCQ7: Sales model of ""blind boxes""",2025-10-08 17:20,2025-10-08 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800551.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Hoey Simon Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

 It is learnt that in recent years, the sale of products in the form of ""blind boxes"" (i.e. commodities whose contents are unidentifiable by consumers in advance) has become increasingly common among some merchants. However, such sales model has also aroused consumers' concerns about their rights and interests as well as its impact on minors. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the authorities have regulated the sales model of ""blind boxes"" under the current legal and regulatory framework;

(2) as there are views that under the sales model of ""blind boxes"", consumers are more inclined to pursue the thrill and chance-taking mentality from not being able to identify the contents of the ""blind box"" items in advance rather than the items themselves, whether the Government has assessed the gambling elements that may be inherent in the sales model of ""blind boxes"" and its impact on minors;

(3) it is learnt that some European Union countries, Singapore and the Mainland have imposed regulation on the sale of ""blind boxes"", whether the authorities will consider drawing on the experience of the aforesaid countries to improve the current regulatory framework for the sales model of ""blind boxes"";

(4) it is learnt that in addition to ""blind boxes"" available for sale offline, consumers can also purchase ""blind boxes"" sold outside Hong Kong through online platforms, whether the authorities have assessed if the existing legislation and regulation are sufficient to guard against such risks relating to tax avoidance and prohibited articles that may be associated with ""blind boxes"" sold outside Hong Kong; and

(5) as the State Administration for Market Regulation issued the Guidelines on Rules for Blind Box Business Operations (for Trial Implementation) in June 2023, which include a specific negative sales list prohibiting the sale of certain commodities such as medicinal products, medical devices as well as flammables and explosives in the form of ""blind boxes"", while also imposing restrictions on products such as cosmetics and food that have a bearing on public health, whether the Government will consider drawing on such practice to regulate the sales practice of commodities relating to public health and safety?

Reply:

President,

 Having consulted the Home Affairs and Youth Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Environment and Ecology Bureau, the Security Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, and the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (C&ED), our consolidated reply to various parts of the question is as follows:

 The Government has been committed to safeguarding the rights and interests of consumers, and attaches great importance to the safety of products sold in the market. Regarding ""blind boxes"" which have gained popularity in recent years, we note that other jurisdictions, including the Mainland, have been regulating, among others, relevant sales practices and product safety.

 Currently, various laws are in place in Hong Kong to protect the rights and interests of consumers. Among others, the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (Cap. 362) prohibits traders from subjecting consumers to unfair trade practices, including false trade descriptions, misleading omissions, aggressive commercial practices, bait advertising, bait-and-switch and wrongly accepting payment. The Trade Descriptions Ordinance covers goods and services, and is applicable to the trade practices of both physical and online traders. A trader deploying any of the above unfair trade practices when selling ""blind boxes"" to consumers will contravene the law.

 The C&ED, as the principal enforcement agency of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, has been actively combating unfair trade practices through enforcement actions, compliance promotion, and publicity and public education, with a view to protecting consumer rights and interests. If a trader is suspected of having engaged in unfair trade practices, the C&ED will take enforcement actions decisively. On the other hand, the Consumer Council endeavours to study and promote the protection of consumers' rights and interests, including handling consumer complaints concerning goods and services. If consumers suspect that a trader is engaging in unfair trade practices when selling ""blind boxes"", they could report the matter to the C&ED or file a complaint with the Council.

 In addition, at present, various laws in Hong Kong regulate the safety of different types of products or articles. Any person supplying relevant products or articles to consumers, regardless of the form, packaging and sales channel, is responsible for ensuring that their safety complies with the relevant legal requirements.

 In respect of toys products, the Toys and Children's Products Safety Ordinance (Cap. 424) regulates the safety of toys, which are manufactured, imported or supplied for local use. The Toys and Children's Products Safety (Additional Safety Standards or Requirements) Regulation also stipulates that a toy supplied in Hong Kong must carry information including identification markings (i.e. the full name and address of the manufacturer, importer or supplier) and the bilingual warnings or cautions (with respect to the safe keeping, use, consumption or disposal) applicable to the toy.

 For drugs (including pharmaceutical products and proprietary Chinese medicines (pCms)), the current regulations aim to ensure that drugs meet relevant standards for safety, quality and efficacy, thereby safeguarding public health and safety. They must be registered under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138) (PPO) or the Chinese Medicine Ordinance (Cap. 549) before they can be sold. All registered pharmaceutical products and pCms must bear labels that correspond to the registration particulars, clearly stating information such as the Hong Kong registration number, product name, active ingredients, manufacturer information, etc. Selling drugs in the form of ""blind boxes"" may violate relevant legislation. When purchasing drugs, members of the public should carefully read the information on the packaging labels, and should not buy or use products of doubtful composition or from unknown sources.

 As regards medical devices, some products are already regulated by existing legislation, including the PPO, the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance (Cap. 456) and the Trade Descriptions Ordinance etc, depending on the characteristics and features of the products concerned. Before purchasing and using medical devices, members of the public should also thoroughly familiarise themselves with the product to ensure it meets their needs. The Government is actively developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub, and will set up the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation in 2026, implement ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration in phases and submit a legislative proposal on regulating medical devices, to enhance medical products regulation.

 As regards dangerous goods, the Dangerous Goods Ordinance (Cap. 295) and its subsidiary legislation regulate the manufacture, storage, conveyance and use of dangerous goods (including explosives and inflammable substances). A trader supplying any dangerous goods regulated under the above legislation in the form of ""blind boxes"" must comply with the legal requirements. If the articles inside the ""blind boxes"" are commonly used in daily life and available in retail stores (such as alcohol handrub/sanitiser, glue, etc), and the container sizes of which do not exceed the maximum package size specified in the Dangerous Goods (Application and Exemption) Regulation 2012, they are classified as dangerous goods in consumer packs, and will be exempted from the packing, marking and labelling requirements.

 As regards food, according to the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132), all food sold in Hong Kong shall be safe for human consumption. It must also comply with the subsidiary legislation under the aforementioned ordinance concerning food safety and food safety standards. Specifically, according to the Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) Regulations, unless exempted, the labelling or marking of the prepackaged food for sale in Hong Kong, whether in the form of ""blind boxes"" or not, must include relevant information, including indication of durability, statement of special conditions for storage or instructions for use, information on energy value and nutrient content, etc, in either the English or the Chinese language or in both languages.

 Moreover, the safety of consumer goods which are ordinarily supplied for private use in Hong Kong, if not covered by other legislation, is subject to the regulation of the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance and its subsidiary legislation, the Consumer Goods Safety Regulation. Pursuant to the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance, manufacturers, importers and suppliers should ensure that the consumer goods they supply are reasonably safe. The Consumer Goods Safety Regulation stipulates that any warning or caution marked on the package of consumer goods must be in both the English and the Chinese languages in a legible and conspicuous manner.

 The Government will continue to closely monitor the trends of unfair trade practices and the latest requirements for safety standards of various articles to formulate appropriate strategies, thereby protecting consumers' rights and interests and safety.

 Furthermore, there are strict regulations in Hong Kong on the import and export of all prohibited/controlled items and dutiable commodities. These regulations are applicable to all modes of import and export, including articles purchased through cross-border electronic commerce platforms. According to the Import and Export Ordinance (Cap. 60), import and export of all controlled items (including dangerous drugs, arms, ammunition, weapons, controlled chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and animals and plants, etc) must be accompanied by a valid licence or permit issued by the relevant authorities. Any person who brings any controlled item into/out of Hong Kong (whether by person, by post, or through purchasing agents or consolidated consignments) without a valid licence or permit may be prosecuted, in addition to confiscation of the subject item. In terms of tax, apart from four categories of dutiable commodities that are subject to duty under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (Cap. 109) (i.e. liquor, tobacco, hydrocarbon and methyl alcohol), Hong Kong does not impose duty on any other imported or exported goods. Any person who imports or exports dutiable goods must obtain a valid permit from the C&ED and make proper declaration on the manifest. For consumption of dutiable goods in Hong Kong, one must ensure that the relevant duty has been duly paid."

Monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes continues to drop in September,2025-10-08 17:00,2025-10-08 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800465.htm,"  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (October 8) announced that the monthly gravidtrap index (MGI) for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in September was 2.5 per cent, lower than the 5.3 per cent in August. This reflects the continued efforts by relevant government departments to intensify mosquito prevention and elimination operations, resulting in the improvement of the overall mosquito infestation situation this month. In addition, the FEHD has strengthened the dissemination of information on the gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes so that more citizens can quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation. The department will continue its mosquito control work to further reduce the risk of transmission of chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF).

  In September, all 64 survey areas recorded an area gravidtrap index (AGI) lower than the alert level of 20 per cent. The decreases in the MGI and the AGI are attributable to the continuous and intensified mosquito prevention and elimination operations by various government departments and stakeholders, and may also have been affected by factors such as weather. The monthly rainfall was 528.7 millimetres in September, showing a decrease from the 939.2mm in August and 601.7mm in July. Overall, the MGI for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in September was 2.5 per cent, at Level 1 (indicating the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in the survey areas was not extensive). Relevant departments and stakeholders will persistently intensify mosquito prevention and elimination operations.

  Moreover, the monthly density index for Aedes albopictus in September was 1.1, which represented that an average of 1.1 Aedes albopictus adults were found in the Aedes-positive gravidtraps, indicating that the number of adult Aedes albopictus was not abundant in the survey areas.

  The FEHD currently makes regular announcements on gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus on its webpage. To allow more citizens to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation, the FEHD has strengthened information dissemination by promptly announcing the latest gravidtrap indexes through press releases and social media.

  In addition, to further reduce the risk of transmission of CF, the FEHD has extended the intensified mosquito control work, which was originally activated when the AGI reaches 20 per cent, to cover areas with the AGI falling between 10 and 20 per cent. Specifically, the FEHD will conduct detailed risk assessments in the areas concerned to identify locations with higher mosquito infestation risks and, in collaboration with relevant departments and stakeholders, conduct intensive and targeted mosquito control work. The FEHD will also notify nearby housing estates, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and work together to take mosquito prevention and elimination measures.

  To reduce the risk of transmission of CF and DF, the FEHD continues to step up mosquito prevention and control measures across all districts and to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations within a 250 metre radius of the residence of patients and the places patients had visited during the infectious period, including removing mosquito breeding grounds, applying larvicides to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and carrying out ultra-low volume fogging operations in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

  The FEHD continues to conduct its three-phase Anti-mosquito Campaign this year. The third phase of the territory-wide campaign was launched on August 4 and will run until October 24. During the period, the district offices of the FEHD will target areas that have drawn particular concern, such as public markets, cooked food centres and hawker bazaars, single-block buildings, streets and back lanes, common parts of buildings, village houses, construction sites, vacant sites and road works sites to remove accumulated water and carry out mosquito prevention and control work. To further enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control, the FEHD and relevant government departments have carried out phase two of the All-out Anti-mosquito Operations from May 7. In addition to the work of phase one, including eliminating potential mosquito breeding places, the FEHD called on property management entities to arrange for necessary repairs to their premises to minimise mosquito breeding places and commence adult mosquito control measures by means of regular ultra-low volume fogging operations.

  The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  Aedes albopictus is a kind of mosquito that can transmit DF and CF. DF is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and has become endemic in many countries in Southeast Asia. In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. Additionally, according to the WHO, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks this year, and as of August, over 317 000 cases had been reported in 16 countries/regions worldwide. The DF and CF activities in neighbouring areas have remained high. Members of the public should stay vigilant and continue to carry out effective mosquito prevention and control measures."
九月份白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數持續回落,2025-10-08 17:00,2025-10-08 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800463.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（十月八日）公布，九月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之二點五，較八月份的百分之五點三為低，反映相關政府部門持續加緊採取防蚊及滅蚊行動，令本月的整體蚊患情況較上月有所改善。此外，食環署已加強白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數的資訊發放，讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，並會繼續進行控蚊工作，進一步降低基孔肯雅熱及登革熱傳播風險。

九月份，全部64個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數均低於百分之二十的警戒水平。九月份每月誘蚊器指數及分區誘蚊器指數的回落，是由於各政府部門及持份者持續加緊採取防蚊及滅蚊行動，亦有機會受天氣等因素影響。九月份的總雨量為528.7毫米，較八月份的939.2毫米及七月份的601.7毫米下降。整體而言，九月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之二點五，屬於一級水平（顯示監察地區內白紋伊蚊的分布並不廣泛），各相關部門及持份者仍會持續進行控蚊工作。

另外，九月份白紋伊蚊密度指數為一點一，表示在發現白紋伊蚊的誘蚊器中，白紋伊蚊的平均數量為一點一隻，顯示整體監察地區內的白紋伊蚊成蚊數量並不多。

現時，食環署會定期在部門網頁公布白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數。為讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，食環署已加強資訊發放，並通過新聞公報及社交媒體盡快發放最新的誘蚊器指數。

此外，為進一步降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險，食環署將原先在分區指數達20%時啓動的強化控蚊工作，擴展至指數介乎10%至20%的區域。具體而言，食環署會在有關區域進行詳細風險評估，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，聯同各部門及持份者進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作，亦會通知附近的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

為降低基孔肯雅熱及登革熱等蚊傳疾病的傳播風險，食環署繼續在全港各區加強防控蚊患措施，並在病者的住所及於感染期曾到訪的地點250米範圍內進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊蟲滋生地、於不能清除的積水處施放殺幼蟲劑，以及於成蚊棲息處如樹木茂密、陰暗隱蔽的地點和荒廢結構進行超低微量霧化處理，以殺滅成蚊。

食環署今年繼續分三期進行全港滅蚊運動，第三期滅蚊運動已於八月四日展開，至十月二十四日止。其間，食環署各分區辦事處會針對區內一些受關注的地點，例如公眾街巿、熟食中心、小販巿場、單幢式樓宇、街道和後巷、大廈的公用地方、村屋、建築地盤、空置土地及路旁工地等，進行一連串的清除積水及防治蚊患行動。為進一步加強滅蚊的成效，食環署已聯同相關部門，於五月七日起展開第二期全城防蚊及滅蚊行動，除繼續第一期工作，包括清除潛在蚊子滋生地外，食環署呼籲私人物業管理公司及早維修處所，以減少蚊子滋生地，並開始定期以超低微量噴灑方式殺滅成蚊。

食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境以徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

白紋伊蚊是傳播登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的病媒。登革熱常見於熱帶及亞熱帶地區，在多個東南亞國家，已成為風土病。世界衞生組織（世衞）於二○二四年共錄得超過1 400萬宗登革熱個案，創歷史新高。此外，根據世衞的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。今年全球多國爆發基孔肯雅熱，截至八月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過317 000千宗個案。鄰近地區登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的活躍程度仍然高企，巿民不應鬆懈，並應繼續採取有效的防治蚊患措施。"
​立法會：政務司司長就《行政長官2025年施政報告》致謝議案辯論（第一節）致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-10-08 17:00,2025-10-08 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800603.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上就《行政長官2025年施政報告》致謝議案辯論（第一節：深化改革心繫民生、「一國兩制」行穩致遠、強化治理體系和粵港澳大灣區建設）的致辭全文︰

主席：

我衷心感謝李慧琼議員提出的致謝議案，以及多位議員在第一節辯論中提出的寶貴意見。

行政長官早前發表二○二五年《施政報告》，以「深化改革心繫民生發揮優勢同創未來」為主題，在今年作為國家「十四五」規劃收官之年，以及「十五五」規劃謀篇布局之年，提出多項政策措施，引領香港更主動對接國家發展戰略、進一步鞏固香港的競爭力、發展經濟、改善民生，帶領社會改革創新。

剛才議員圍繞「深化改革心繫民生」、「一國兩制」行穩致遠、強化治理體系，以及粵港澳大灣區建設這四個重要議題提出很多很有用的見解。我會先作整體回應，然後各司局長會就其所屬政策範疇作進一步說明。

「一國兩制」行穩致遠

我們會繼續全面準確、堅定不移貫徹「一國兩制」、「港人治港」、高度自治的方針，充分發揮「一國兩制」制度優勢，保持香港長期繁榮穩定。

特區政府已在二○二一年完善選舉制度、二○二三年完善地區治理體系及重塑區議會，全面落實「愛國者治港」原則。我們會全力籌辦好今年十二月七日舉行的第八屆立法會選舉，確保選舉公平、公正、誠實和安全有序進行。我們會確保特區的管治權牢牢掌握在愛國者手中。

特區政府致力構建以愛國愛港為核心、與「一國兩制」方針相適應的主流價值觀。由我擔任主席的「憲法和基本法推廣督導委員會」，已於去年成立轄下的「愛國主義教育工作小組」，以協調政府部門及非政府機構推動愛國主義教育。工作小組認為愛國主義教育是關乎人心、需要深耕細作的工作，應以軟性和打動人心的方式進行。工作小組按香港的實際情況訂下短、中、長期的工作目標和政策措施。今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年，我們的重點是做好抗戰勝利80周年紀念活動。

特區政府舉辦多項紀念和教育活動，得到市民和青少年廣泛參與，有效宣揚銘記歷史、珍愛和平的主題。我們會繼續梳理及修繕保護全港各區的中共抗戰遺址，推廣內地的愛國主義教育設施，並將其納入特區愛國主義教育基地。我們深切明白到愛國主義教育的工作關係到國家安全以及特區的長治久安，因此我們必定會竭盡所能，以更多創新思維，持之以恆，久久為功，在特區全方位推廣愛國主義教育。

維護國家主權、安全、發展利益是「一國兩制」方針的最高原則。《香港國安法》實施五年來，香港從「由亂到治」邁向「由治及興」。特區政府會繼續堅定不移維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，深入踐行「總體國家安全觀」，居安思危，防範風險，確保香港長治久安。我們會加強《憲法》和《基本法》的宣傳教育，加強市民對《憲法》、《基本法》、國家安全，以及「一國兩制」的認識，持續完善維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制，並以多管齊下的策略，推展國家安全相關宣傳教育，將國安信息進一步植根社區。

中華優秀傳統文化是我們的優勢，是維繫國家、民族團結的重要根基。教育局持續透過優化課程、為學生舉辦多元化的全方位學習活動等，增進學生對國家的認識，並以中華文化作為價值觀教育的主軸，進一步加強學生的國民身分認同和文化自信。

教育局將持續支援學校，將愛國主義教育融入日常學與教之中，厚植學生家國情懷，同時繼續凝聚社會各界的資源和力量，並善用內地和本地愛國主義教育設施，讓學生更深入了解國家的歷史文化和成就。

強化治理體系

本屆政府上任以來，持續強化治理體系，致力提升執行效率和服務質素。早前超強颱風樺加沙襲港，由行政長官指導和由我統籌的應對極端天氣督導委員會，發揮頂層領導作用，在充分準備及全方位部署下，迅速統籌協調各相關部門，全力減低對市民的影響。各部門嚴陣以待，整個應對過程展現高效協作與專業能力。

早前有議員提到公務員存有「不做不錯」的心態，我對此並不認同。無論是應對超強颱風樺加沙，或是上個月處理鰂魚涌一枚重達一千磅的戰時炸彈，部門同事均是緊守崗位、全力以赴，大量人員更是通宵達旦工作，充分展現責任感、使命感，以及主動多走一步的專業精神。不同部門同事無分你我，緊密協作，更確保資源的精準投放，以及應變行動的流暢執行。

事實上，本屆政府自上任以來不斷推行改革，建立「以結果為目標」的政府和公務員團隊。在《2025年世界競爭力年報》中，香港在「政府效率」排名世界第二，不但反映香港公務員整體是一支優秀隊伍，亦反映本屆政府的改革和公務員共同努力的成果。

今年《施政報告》就進一步強化治理，提出建立部門首長責任制及強化公務員評核機制。這並非因為不滿公務員整體表現，其目的是要把公務員的管理，變得更為制度化、系統化、公平化。責任制強調部門首長須負責管理好部門團隊，發揮最大效能；同時樹立固定機制，當部門出現問題時，可按問題輕重，作出調整和糾正。

我們亦會強化公務員評核機制，鼓勵優秀公務員精益求精、提振士氣；同時要求管理方針對性地協助有不足的員工提升能力，並妥善處理個別長期表現欠佳的情況，以確保整體服務水平不斷提升。

此外，為進一步提升政府效能，政府將成立AI效能提升組，由政務司副司長領導相關政策局並邀請業界代表參與，推動政府部門有效應用AI人工智能技術。小組將統籌指導各部門應用AI、研究重組工作流程，以及推動科技革新以提效提質。

粵港澳大灣區建設

香港是粵港澳大灣區中心城市和區域發展核心引擎之一，在大灣區建設中肩負引領帶動的重任，在國家進一步改革開放中更具有不可替代的重要作用。特區政府會繼續帶領全社會更主動對接國家戰略、更積極融入國家發展大局，加強與廣東、澳門的互利合作，提升人流、物流、數據流、資金流，促進協同發展。

為深化大灣區內的規則銜接和機制對接，律政司將繼續推動訂立大灣區仲裁員名冊、設立大灣區商事調解及仲裁平台，減低解決跨境爭議的成本，並支持大灣區律師的專業發展，組建大灣區律師聯會，設立法律資訊平台，同時加強推廣香港法律及其他專業服務，支援企業出海需要。

總結

今年的《施政報告》既立足當前，更謀劃長遠。在香港加快邁向「由治及興」的進程上，我們繼續背靠祖國強大後盾，堅定不移貫徹「一國兩制」方針，善用粵港澳大灣區的優勢，同時進一步強化治理，發揮香港擁有獨一無二的優勢，讓香港的發展方向更清晰，道路更廣闊，市民有更多的幸福感和獲得感。

我們期待在接着的環節聽到議員更多意見。主席，我謹此陳辭。"

Speech by SFST at Raffles Family Office Annual Forum 2025 (English only),2025-10-08 16:23,2025-10-08 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800526.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the Raffles Family Office Annual Forum 2025 today (October 8):

Chi Man (Group Chief Executive Officer of Raffles Family Office, Mr Kwan Chi Man), Minister Murangwa (Minister of Finance and Economic Planning of the Republic of Rwanda, Mr Yusuf Murangwa), ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests,

 It is a profound honour to address you at the Raffles Family Office Annual Forum 2025. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the organiser for convening this distinguished gathering.

 The theme of this year's forum, ""The Decade Before, A Century Beyond,"" resonates deeply with the evolving mission of family offices: to preserve wealth, foster values, and also drive positive impact across generations.

  Family offices are undergoing significant transformation, and I wish to share with you a few defining trends that we observed. Firstly, family offices are enhancing governance structures and also investment processes, formalising investment opportunities, adopting institutional-style governance to ensure efficiency and also clarity in decision-making, often separating operations from family offices.

  Secondly, there is a growing focus on private markets, with family offices increasingly allocating capital to private equity, co-investments, and also direct investments in companies, moving away from purely passive public market investments and adopting fund structures to centralise asset management, achieve scale, and also facilitate succession planning.

  And thirdly, driven by collaboration, especially at a global level, family mobility and diverse investment opportunities, family offices are expanding globally and also enhancing services with custom solutions, such as estate planning, insurance, technology adoption, and also collaboration with banks, insurers and wealth tax, to meet these evolving needs.

  All these three trends that I mentioned, professional governance, diversification into private assets and also global operations sophistication, position family offices well to thrive in an era of rapid technological disruption, evolving economic paradigms, and also growing societal expectations. Hong Kong, as a global financial hub, is uniquely positioned to support this journey, offering a platform where bold ideas can flourish and also legacies can endure for generations to come.

 The Government is steadfast in our commitment to positioning our city as the premier hub for family offices in Asia and beyond. Our unique advantages - a robust legal system, world-class financial infrastructure, strategic proximity to the Mainland, and a competitive and simple tax regime - make us an ideal destination for family offices, including those from Africa of course, seeking to establish or expand their operations. Through a multipronged approach, in collaboration with regulators and our industry stakeholders, we have implemented a comprehensive suite of policies to create a conducive and also competitive environment for global family offices.

 A key pillar of our strategy is the profits tax exemption for family-owned investment holding vehicles managed by single family offices here in Hong Kong. This measure reduces the cost of operating here, enabling families to optimise their wealth management strategies and also focus on long-term growth and also legacy building. By alleviating tax constraints, we empower family offices to allocate resources strategically, aligning with their goals of intergenerational wealth preservation and also impact. We will also be expanding the qualifying investments for tax concessions to include private credit and other new asset classes, aligning with the new trend of sector I just highlighted.

 Recognising the crucial role of talent and expertise, as highlighted by Chi Man just now, we established the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy two years ago under the Financial Services Development Council. This academy serves as a collaborative platform to network, share knowledge, and also to train specialised talent to family offices, asset owners, and wealth inheritors. The academy has recently celebrated its second anniversary and has delivered over 20 capacity-building events in collaboration with partners and thought leaders, engaging over 3 000 family asset owners and next-gen leaders in dialogues and also legacy planning. By fostering positive financial management values and also strengthening the talent pool, the academy supports the professionalisation of the sector, ensuring family offices have access to the expertise needed to thrive in a competitive landscape.

  Another initiative that I would highlight is our New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (new CIES) further enriches our ecosystem by attracting high-net-worth individuals and their capital to Hong Kong. Eligible investors who make investments of HK$27 million or above in eligible assets and place HK$3 million into the new CIES Investment Portfolio, as managed by Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, may reside and pursue development in Hong Kong. Recent enhancements demonstrate our responsiveness; from March this year, investments through wholly owned private companies counted towards the threshold, and net asset assessment and calculation requirements have also been relaxed. Moreover, the threshold of the transaction price of residential real estate is now reduced, while the aggregate cap for the total investment amount in real estate is also raised. These measures create synergies with our tax concession regime, encouraging more family offices to anchor in Hong Kong and contribute to our vibrant financial ecosystem.

 Beyond fiscal and operational support, we are fostering Hong Kong as a global centre for philanthropy and cultural innovation. Initiatives include developing art storage facilities at our airport, which cater to the growing interest in luxury assets among family offices. In additional, we are promoting Hong Kong as a philanthropic hub, aligning with the aspirations of many family offices to drive positive social impact. These efforts resonate with the forum's theme of building legacies that extend beyond financial wealth, contributing to a better future for communities worldwide.

 Our policies have delivered tangible results. We set a target to facilitate at least 200 family offices to establish or expand operations in Hong Kong by the end of 2025 - a goal we proudly achieved ahead of schedule in September this year. As announced in the latest Policy Address, we target to attract an additional 220 family offices to Hong Kong from the year of 2026 to the year of 2028, further enriching our market size.

 Finally, the third Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit, our flagship event for family offices, was held in March this year under the theme ""Hong Kong of the World, for the World"". It convened family offices to discuss technology, artificial intelligence, philanthropy, and also cultural innovation, fostering collaborations to create a sustainable future. This summit underscores Hong Kong's role as a convener of global ideas and a catalyst for positive change, aligning with the aspirations of family offices to create a lasting impact. I am very glad to share that it will return once again next year.

 Before I go, I would like to congratulate Chi Man for organising this event, and also choosing the right colour for the forum because it is in the same colour of the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address. At the same time, as Chinese say, it takes 10 years to grow a tree but a hundred years to cultivate a talent, so I am sure it is just the start of a new journey and the use of a tree pattern here is very apt.

 Again, the Raffles Family Office Annual Forum 2025 embodies the spirit of ""The Decade Before, A Century Beyond."" It challenges us to learn from the past, engage with the present, and build a future where family offices thrive as stewards of wealth and values. Hong Kong invites you to leverage our unparalleled advantages - robust policies, strategic location, and a dynamic financial ecosystem - to establish or expand your operations. Our comprehensive support, from tax exemptions to talent development, positions Hong Kong as the premier destination for family offices seeking to build legacies that endure. Together, let us weave the tapestry of the future, drawing from the lessons of the past decade to create a century of prosperity, impact, and responsibility.

 Thank you."
立法會八題：預防帶狀疱疹,2025-10-08 16:15,2025-10-08 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800495.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上陸瀚民議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

據悉現時已確認的自身免疫力系統失調病症約有80多種，而香港患有相關病症的病人人數高達三萬；此類病人較平常人更大機會感染帶狀疱疹（俗稱「生蛇」）。雖然私營醫療市場有提供各種形式及價格的帶狀疱疹疫苗注射計劃（俗稱「蛇針」），惟收費不菲，一般醫療集團的收費不少於5,000港元，但該疫苗的有效保護期為10年，市民其後仍需再次接種，一般基層市民未必能應付相關開支。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於現時政府的防疫注射計劃並不包括帶狀疱疹疫苗，而政府於去年十一月二十日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，疫苗可預防疫病科學委員會認為需要更多有關成本效益分析的本地數據，方得以考慮未來應否把帶狀疱疹疫苗納入政府的防疫注射計劃，當局有否進行相關檢視；如有，詳情和最新的檢視結果分別為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）據悉由於患有自身免疫力系統失調的病人在日常生活中都可能出現不明疼痛、紅腫及各種炎症，因此較一般人更難確定他們是否患上帶狀疱疹，令該等病人花費很長時間及成本方可確定其病因，當局有否制訂既定機制，協助該等病人及早發現和治療帶狀疱疹；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）長遠而言，當特區政府的公共財政資源回復充裕時，當局會否考慮在其防疫注射計劃下，增加帶狀疱疹疫苗注射項目，讓患有自身免疫力系統失調的基層病人或其他高危人士可接受獲資助的疫苗注射服務？

答覆：

主席︰

帶狀疱疹（俗稱「生蛇」）是由引起水痘的水痘帶狀疱疹病毒引致。病毒於水痘患者痊癒後潛藏在體內的神經系統。多年後當身體免疫力下降，有機會誘發自身病毒重新激活，出現帶狀疱疹，故此並非由傳染而引發的疾病。患者皮膚出現一種令人痛楚、呈帶狀的紅疹並帶有水泡，一般並不嚴重，出現嚴重併發症或死亡風險不高，及早使用抗病毒藥物治療可加快水泡癒合、減輕症狀和出現併發症的風險。

接種帶狀疱疹疫苗可作為預防之用。現時有一款帶狀疱疹疫苗於本港註冊。根據現有的國際文獻資料，帶狀疱疹疫苗的有效保護期一般約為十年。

衞生署衞生防護中心轄下疫苗可預防疾病科學委員會（科學委員會）定期檢視本地疫苗可預防疾病的流行病學情況、世界衞生組織（世衞）的最新建議、疫苗的科學發展及證據、疫苗成分的更新、成本效益研究，以及其他衞生當局的實際應用經驗，從公共衞生角度向衞生署提供相關疫苗接種建議。政府會參考科學委員會的建議，並審慎評估多項因素，包括疾病對社會造成的整體醫療負擔、疫苗供應情況、大規模疫苗接種的成本效益、市民接受程度和其他公共衞生因素，以制訂各項政府資助免疫接種計劃。

就未納入政府資助免疫接種計劃的其他疫苗，市民可諮詢家庭醫生的專業意見，了解接種相關疫苗的效益、風險及必要性，並根據醫生對健康狀況、過往病歷等因素而作出的評估，在知情同意下決定是否安排接種。

就陸瀚民議員的提問，經諮詢衞生署和醫院管理局後，本局現回覆如下：

（一）及（三）科學委員會於二○二三年九月討論了接種帶狀疱疹疫苗事宜。科學委員會認為需要有更多涉及成本效益分析層面的本地數據，方得以考慮未來應否把帶狀疱疹疫苗納入政府的防疫注射計劃。科學委員會同時認為本港的帶狀疱疹疫苗安全及有效。個別較年長及免疫力弱的成人可考慮在諮詢醫生意見後接種帶狀疱疹疫苗，以保護自己免受帶狀疱疹及其併發症影響。

醫務衞生局已委託香港大學進行有關帶狀疱疹疫苗成本效益分析。待成本效益分析完成後，科學委員會預計將於二○二六年根據相關分析結果，討論帶狀疱疹疫苗接種事宜。

政府會繼續密切留意相關因素，包括世衞的最新建議、科學委員會的意見、疫苗的發展及成本變化、疾病的整體醫療負擔等，考慮是否有需要推行由政府資助的帶狀疱疹疫苗注射計劃。如確立有需要推行，亦須要考慮針對不同群組的資助水平。

另外，在基層醫療層面，家庭醫生和基層醫療專業人員會緊密合作，提供有關疫苗接種（包括帶狀疱疹疫苗）的資訊和教育，提升市民對帶狀疱疹疫苗的認識及預防意識。

（二）正如上文所述，帶狀疱疹一般並不嚴重，出現嚴重併發症或死亡風險不高。

帶狀疱疹的患者，受影響的部位首先會出現痕癢或微痛，帶有灼熱感覺，一至三天後才出現紅疹；紅疹會變成水泡，再蔓延成帶狀。水泡可持續一至14天，期間或會出現膿皰或血水。然後水泡會潰破或萎縮，乾水後結痂，為期兩至三星期。抗病毒特效藥可縮短帶狀疱疹痊癒所需的時間，在病發三至五天內服食最為理想。

政府鼓勵市民特別是免疫力弱人士提高警覺，如市民出現病徵，應盡早求醫，並按醫生指示用藥。同時，政府致力提升以地區為本的基層醫療健康服務，扭轉現時「重治療，輕預防」的醫療體制和觀念。措施包括政府透過地區康健中心推行「健康人生計劃」，針對市民不同人生階段的健康需求，根據市民的性別、年齡、家族病史等個人因素，制訂個人化的健康管理方案。政府透過家庭醫生和基層醫療專業人員提供慢性疾病和癌症篩查和健康生活模式的建議和教育，促進市民整體健康。政府亦藉此機會提醒巿民，保持良好生活習慣包括均衡飲食和適量運動，有助增強抵抗力和預防帶狀疱疹。"
LCQ8: Prevention of herpes zoster,2025-10-08 16:15,2025-10-08 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800496.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Benson Luk and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  It is learnt that there are at present over 80 recognised autoimmune disorders, with as many as 30 000 patients in Hong Kong suffering from such disorders who are at greater risk of contracting herpes zoster (HZ) (commonly known as ""shingles"") than average persons. While various forms of HZ vaccination plans (commonly known as ""shingles vaccine"") are available at various prices in the private healthcare market, the charges are considerable, with ordinary medical groups charging no less than HK$5,000. Yet the vaccine provides effective protection for only 10 years and revaccination is necessary afterwards. Ordinary grass roots may not be able to afford the expenses. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that HZ vaccine is currently not included in the Government Vaccination Programme, and that in its reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on November 20 last year, the Government indicated that the Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases considered that more local data from a cost-benefit analysis would be required for future consideration on whether to include HZ vaccine in the Government Vaccination Programme, whether relevant reviews have been conducted by the authorities; if so, of the details and the outcomes of the latest review; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as it is learnt that it is more difficult for patients with autoimmune disorders than average persons to ascertain whether they have HZ because they may often experience unknown pain, redness and various inflammations, and as a result these patients have to spend considerable time and expenses to identify the cause of their ailments, whether the authorities have formulated any established mechanism to assist such patients in early detection and treatment of HZ; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) in the long term, whether the SAR Government will consider including HZ vaccine in its Vaccination Programme when its public financial resources return to a sufficient level, so that grass-roots patients with autoimmune disorders or other high-risk individuals can receive subsidised vaccination services?

Reply:

President,

  Herpes Zoster (also known as Shingles) is caused by varicella-zoster virus, which is also responsible for Chickenpox. The virus remains latent in the nervous system of patients recovered from Chickenpox and may reactivate in times of weakened immune system many years later, inducing Herpes Zoster. Therefore, Herpes Zoster is not a disease caused by acute infection. Patients would develop painful, belt-like skin rash with blisters. Herpes Zoster is not serious in general and the risk of serious complications or death is not high. Early treatment with antiviral medications can speed up the healing of blisters; reduce the symptoms and the risk of complications.

  One of the preventive measures against Herpes Zoster is to receive Herpes Zoster vaccine. Currently, there is one Herpes Zoster vaccine registered in Hong Kong. According to international literature available so far, the effective protection period of Herpes Zoster vaccines is around ten years generally.

  The Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases (SCVPD) under the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) regularly reviews the epidemiological situation of local vaccine-preventable diseases, the latest recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), scientific developments and evidence on vaccines, updates on vaccine components, cost-effectiveness studies, as well as actual experiences of other health authorities, and provides relevant vaccination recommendations to the DH from a public health perspective. The Government will make reference to the recommendations of the SCVPD and carefully consider various factors, including the overall medical burden of a disease on the community, vaccine availability, cost-effectiveness of large-scale vaccination, public acceptability, and other public health factors, in formulating various government subsidised immunisation programmes.

  For vaccines not included in the government's subsidised immunisation programmes, individuals can consult their family doctor for professional advice to understand the benefits, risks and necessity of vaccination. Based on the doctor's assessment of health status, medical history, and other factors, individuals can make informed decisions on whether to proceed with vaccination under informed consent.

  In response to the Hon Benson Luk's question, Health Bureau's reply after consultation with the DH and the Hospital Authority is as follows:

(1) and (3) The SCVPD discussed the topic of Herpes Zoster vaccines in September 2023. It considered that more local data from a cost-benefit analysis perspective would be essential for future consideration on the inclusion of Herpes Zoster vaccine into the government's vaccination programme. The SCVPD was of the view that Herpes Zoster vaccines available in Hong Kong were safe and effective. Individual older adults and adults with immunocompromised conditions may consider receiving Herpes Zoster vaccine after consulting their doctors to protect themselves against Herpes Zoster and its complications.

  The Health Bureau has commissioned The University of Hong Kong to conduct an analysis on the cost-benefit of the Herpes Zoster vaccine. Upon completion of the cost-benefit analysis, the SCVPD is expected to discuss the vaccination for Herpes Zoster based on the relevant analysis results in 2026.

  The Government will continue to closely monitor relevant factors, including the latest recommendations of the WHO, the views of the SCVPD, the development and change in costs of vaccines, and the overall medical burden of the disease to consider whether to implement a government-subsidised Herpes Zoster vaccination programme. The subsidy level targeting different groups will also need to be considered if it is necessary to implement the programme.

  Moreover, at the primary healthcare level, family doctors and primary healthcare professionals will closely collaborate to provide information and education on vaccinations (including Herpes Zoster vaccine), to enhance public awareness of the Herpes Zoster vaccine and preventive consciousness.

(2) As mentioned above, Herpes Zoster is not serious in general and the risk of serious complications or death is not high. 

  Patients with Herpes Zoster first experience itch or slight pain with burning sensation in the affected area, with rash appearing one to three days later. The rash then develops into blisters, which further spread in a belt-like pattern and can last from one to 14 days, during which pustules or trickle of blood may appear. This will be followed by bursting, collapse and drying up of the fluid-filled blisters and crusting over two to three weeks. Antiviral drug can shorten the recovery time of Herpes Zoster patients and it is optimal to take it within three to five days of the onset of the disease.

  The Government encourages the public, especially immunocompromised individuals to remain vigilant. Members of the public, who experience symptoms, should seek medical advice early and take medications according to doctors' instructions. At the same time, the Government is committed to enhancing district-based primary healthcare services to shift the emphasis of the present healthcare system and mindset from treatment-oriented to prevention-oriented. Initiatives include promoting the Life Course Preventive Care Plan through District Health Centres to formulate personalised health management plans that address the health needs of citizens across different life stages, based on personal factors such as their gender, age and family history. The Government provides chronic disease and cancer screening, as well as advice and education on healthy lifestyle through family doctors and primary healthcare professionals, with a view to improving the overall health conditions of the citizens. The Government also takes this opportunity to remind the public that maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, can help strengthen immunity and prevent Herpes Zoster."
