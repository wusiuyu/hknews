Three students who were honoured with the Best Camper Performance awards for their outstanding efforts also shared their feelings and valuable experiences gained from the training camp. They expressed admiration for the country's aerospace experts, feeling proud of its remarkable aerospace endeavours and wishing to contribute to the aerospace industry in the future.

 The training camp ran from July 25 to August 2. Students visited various key astronomy and aerospace facilities, including making their first visit to the Wuqing Station of the National Astronomical Observatories in Beijing, where they learned about data reception and deep space communication systems of the Tianwen-1 Mars exploration mission. The students also met with the commander of the Shenzhou-19, Mr Cai Xuzhe,who participated in the Shenzhou-14 and Shenzhou-19 space missions. Mr Cai has set multiple records during the extravehicular activities of the Shenzhou-19 mission: His first spacewalk lasted nine hours, breaking the world record for the longest single spacewalk, and he completed a total of five spacewalks across two missions, making him the astronaut with the most spacewalks to date in China.

 The students also visited Beijing Aerospace City, the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, China National Space Administration Space Debris Observation and Data Application Center, and National Time Service Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where they gained an in-depth understanding of China's manned space research, development, and application. At the China Astronaut Research and Training Center, they experienced the aerospace medicine project and astronaut training activities, such as the donning and doffing of spacesuits and blood redistribution training. During the rocket model workshop, they also learned about the basic structure of rockets and how to build rocket models.

 Launched in 2009, the Young Astronaut Training Camp has been held on 14 occasions, attracting nearly 400 students to join. Recruitment for this year's training camp started in May and received an overwhelming response. After three rounds of selection - a quiz on astronomy and space science, a three-day pre-camp training and an interview - participants were selected as Young Astronauts out of more than 120 applicants from around 80 local secondary schools.

 The training camp is jointly presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, in association with the Beijing-Hong Kong Academic Exchange Centre. It is organised by the Hong Kong Space Museum and sponsored by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. It is one of the programmes under the Chinese Culture Promotion Series.

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-02 17:30,2025-09-02 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/02/P2025090200665.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (September 2), nonew cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

""According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 225 new CF cases in Guangdong in the past week (August 24 to 30), showing a further decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 830 cases (August 10 to 16) and 336 cases (August 17 to 23) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the number of new CF cases in Guangdong Province has continued to decline over the past month, many countries worldwide are experiencing CF outbreaks. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad. The CHP also urged schools to follow the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)'s anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. They should also remind staff members and students to enact mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases on campus,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 13 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The FEHD continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising them on mosquito-borne disease prevention and tips on travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. Moreover, the Visiting Health Teams have also reminded all residential care homes for the elderly in Hong Kong to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of mosquito-borne diseases.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite (www.chp.gov.hk/en/static/104022.html).

Dr Tsui reminded members of the public that they must take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have a travel history. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-09-02 17:30,2025-09-02 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/02/P2025090200664.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（九月二日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月二十四日至三十日）廣東省新增225宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較過去兩周分別為830宗（八月十日至十六日）及336宗（八月十七日至二十三日）進一步減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然廣東省的新增病例數字過去一個月持續遞減，但現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。中心亦呼籲學校按照食物環境衞生署（食環署）的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，務必提醒教職員及學生，應時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。」

本港今年累計錄得13宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

食環署繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

​
​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

​為加強長者對預防蚊傳疾病的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊已透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解相關疾病的預防及提供外遊健康建議。此外，外展分隊亦已提醒全港所有安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關蚊傳疾病的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成10種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，無論在本地或是外遊期間都必須時刻採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施。若出現相關病徵，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後，應立即求醫，並通知醫生相關旅遊史。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

During the operation, Customs, the HKPF, Mainland and overseas law enforcement agencies detected a total of 74 drug cases, seizing around 1 219 kilograms of suspected drugs including cannabis, ketamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and MDMA, with an estimated market value of over $479 million. Ninety-six persons suspected to be connected with the cases were arrested.

During the operation, Hong Kong Customs and the HKPF collaborated with 12 Mainland and overseas law enforcement agencies to facilitate close and real-time exchange of intelligence, conducting joint assessments to effectively track and intercept air passengers involved in drug trafficking. The Anti-Smuggling Bureau of Mainland Customs, the Narcotics Control Department of the Shenzhen Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection, German Customs, Canada Border Services Agency and the Central Narcotics Bureau of Singapore also successfully detected drug trafficking cases in their respective regions.

Customs and the HKPF have long striven to intercept the inflow of drugs to Hong Kong by adopting a risk management and an intelligence-led approach according to the trends of drug markets and smuggling channels. Both sides will continue to make necessary adjustments in strategy and deployment in accordance with changes in the drug trafficking trends and enhance co-operation with overseas enforcement agencies to fight against transnational narcotics trafficking activities.

Customs and the HKPF remind members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return.

八月份第11批涵蓋兩個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及九個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年八月共11批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共64個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年七月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這64個監察區中，44個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有15區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

​食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Among the 11th batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering two survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering nine survey areas in August, all were below 10 per cent.

TheFEHD has so far released 11 batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August 2025, covering 64 survey areas. Among these 64 survey areas, 44 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. July 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Fifteen other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on September 1 to noon today (September 2), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 150 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 162 461 samples of food imported from Japan (including 106 281 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 36 800 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected counterfeit goods worth about $1.27 million (with photo),2025-09-02 15:15,2025-09-02 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/02/P2025090200565.htm,"âHong Kong Customs on August 13 seized about 7 700 suspected counterfeit goods, including sneakers, bags and jerseys, with an estimated market value of about $1.27 million at the Tuen Mun River Trade Terminal Customs Cargo Examination Compound.

Through risk assessment, Customs on that day inspected a 40-foot container arriving in Hong Kong from the Mainland. After inspection, Customs officers found the batch of suspected counterfeit goods therein.

An initial investigation revealed that the batch of suspected counterfeit goods would have been transshipped to overseas regions.

The investigation is ongoing.

Customs will continue to take stringent enforcement action against counterfeit goods and smuggling activities through risk assessment and intelligence analysis.

Under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, any person who imports or exports any goods to which a forged trademark is applied commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

An August with outbreaks of heavy rain,2025-09-02 15:00,2025-09-02 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/02/P2025090200253.htm,"  The month of August was much wetter than usual, mainly due to the heavy rain associated with an active southwest monsoon and upper-air disturbances in early August, and a number of tropical cyclones in mid-August. The monthly rainfall recorded at the Hong Kong Observatory was 939.2 millimetres, more than double the August normal of 453.2 millimetres, and the third highest on record for August. Although the first half of the year was much drier than usual, with outbreaks of heavy rain in July and August, the accumulated rainfall in the first eight months of the year was 1 985.3 millimetres, approximating the normal value of 1 921.5 millimetres for the same period.The month was also much cloudier than usual. The mean amount of cloud in the month was 81 per cent, 11 per cent above the normal of 70 per cent, one of the fourth highest on record for August. While the monthly mean temperature of 29.0 degrees was only 0.3 degrees above the normal, together with higher than normal temperatures in June and July, the summer of this year from June to August was hotter than normal. The mean minimum temperature of 27.2 degrees, the mean maximum temperature of 31.9 degrees and the mean temperature of 29.1 degrees were respectively one of the sixth, one of the seventh and one of the ninth highest on record for the same period.

Under the influence of a southwesterly airstream, the weather of Hong Kong was very hot with sunny periods on the first day of the month. There were also heavy showers and thunderstorms in some areas in the afternoon with more than 70 millimetres of rainfall recorded over the North District. An active southwest monsoon and upper-air disturbances brought heavy showers and squally thunderstorms to the coast of Guangdong from August 2 to 5. The outbreaks of heavy showers necessitated the issuance of Black Rainstorm Warnings three times in just four days. The Hong Kong Observatory Headquarters registered a record-breaking daily rainfall of 368.9 millimetres on August 5, the highest daily rainfall in August since records began in 1884. This daily rainfall amount was already more than 80 per cent of the August normal rainfall. The accumulated rainfall recorded at the Observatory during these four days was nearly 600 millimetres, with rainfall even exceeding 800 millimetres over Tseung Kwan O and Tsz Wan Shan. In the midst of the incessant downpour, the temperature at the Observatory dropped to the month's lowest of 24.0 degrees on the morning of August 5.

While showery conditions persisted on August 6, with the establishment of an anticyclone aloft, apart from a few showers, it was generally fine with prolonged heat from August 7 to 12. The maximum temperature at the Observatory rose to 34.4 degrees on the afternoon of August 10, the highest of the month. Meanwhile, Typhoon Podul over the western North Pacific moved west-northwestwards towards Taiwan on August 12. It further intensified into a severe typhoon before making landfall over the southeastern part of Taiwan the next day. Under the influence of its outer subsiding air, the weather in Hong Kong was mainly fine apart from isolated showers on August 13. It was also extremely hot in the afternoon. Podul rapidly weakened into a tropical depression as it moved into inland Guangdong on August 14. Under the influence of its outer band of intense thundery showers, it was overcast with heavy showers and severe squally thunderstorms in Hong Kong. More than 100 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over many places, and rainfall even exceeded 200 millimetres over Lantau Island, Tuen Mun and parts of Hong Kong Island. The incessant downpour necessitated the issuance of the Black Rainstorm Warning for the fifth time this year, breaking the previous record of three times set in 2000 and 2006 since the commencement of the rainstorm system operation in 1992. While there were still a few showers on August 15, with the dissipation of Podul and the establishment of a ridge of high pressure over southeastern China, local weather turned mainly fine on August 16.

Meanwhile, the broad area of low pressure over the central part of the South China Sea intensified into a tropical depression on August 16. It moved west-northwestwards towards the seas south of Hainan Island on August 17 and skirted across Beibu Wan the next day. Under the combined effect of the tropical depression and the ridge of high pressure over southeastern China, it was windy with squally showers and thunderstorms on August 17. The heavy showery weather continued on August 18 with more than 100 millimetres of rainfall recorded over many places in Hong Kong.

The weather remained unsettled on August 19 under the influence of an active southerly airstream. More than 30 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over most parts of the territory, and rainfall even exceeded 100 millimetres over parts of Kowloon and the New Territories. With the strengthening of an anticyclone aloft, local weather was generally fine and very hot from August 20 to 22.

The area of low pressure over the seas west of Luzon intensified into a tropical depression on the night of August 22 and was later named Kajiki. Kajiki moved westwards across the central part of the South China Sea and intensified progressively into a severe tropical storm the next day. It rapidly intensified into a severe typhoon over the seas south of Hainan Island on August 24 and made landfall over the northern part of Vietnam the next night. Locally, it was mainly fine on August 23 apart from a few showers and squally thunderstorms at night. There were sunny periods during the following two days. Under the influence of a ridge of high pressure over southeastern China, apart from isolated showers and thunderstorms over the western part of the New Territories in the afternoon, local weather was mainly fine and very hot on August 26 and 27. Affected by upper-air disturbances, it was mainly cloudy with a few showers and squally thunderstorms locally on August 28. Moreover, Nongfa formed as a tropical depression over the central part of the South China Sea that afternoon and moved northwestwards towards the seas south of Hainan Island. The Standby Signal, No. 1 was issued that night, for the eighth time this year, breaking the highest record between January and August since 1946. Nongfa intensified into a tropical storm and tracked across the seas south of Hainan Island on August 30. It made landfall over central and northern Vietnam that afternoon and then weakened into a tropical depression at night. Locally, it was very hot with sunny periods on August 29. It was also windy under the combined effect of a ridge of high pressure over southeastern China and Nongfa. An easterly airstream affected the coast of Guangdong on August 30 and the weather of Hong Kong was mainly cloudy with a few showers. The weather turned generally fine and very hot on the last day of the month.

Eleven tropical cyclones occurred over the South China Sea and the western North Pacific in August 2025.

Details of issuance and cancellation of various warnings/signals in the month are summarised in Table 1. Monthly meteorological figures and departures from normal for August are tabulated in Table 2."

Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

天氣酷熱　衞生署提醒市民預防高溫引發的疾病,2025-09-02 06:45,2025-09-02 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/02/P2025090200006.htm,"天氣酷熱，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月二日）提醒市民，應採取適當措施預防高溫引發的疾病，例如熱痙攣、熱衰竭和中暑。

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

市民可透過以下途徑，取得更多資料：衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111）、中暑專頁、紫外線專頁；天文台「打電話問天氣」（1878 200）、最新天氣報告及預報、紫外線指​數、遠足及攀山天氣資訊；及勞工處於工作暑熱警告生效期間，對戶外工作的僱員和其僱主發布有關預防中暑措施的新聞公報。"
