They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
Hospital Authority appeals to community service organisations and public not to abuse services of Accident and Emergency Departments and Family Medicine Clinics for medical fee waiver applications,2026-02-01 18:30,2026-02-01 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/01/P2026020100552.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

In response to a media report citing a community service organisation that a citizen who did not have a follow-up appointment at public hospitals was unable to apply for medical fee waivers, the Hospital Authority (HA) spokesperson today (February 1) indicated that the HA has been proactively assisting eligible citizens in obtaining medical fee waivers before accessing public healthcare services. The HA is now accepting applications for medical fee waivers from patients with scheduled appointments within two months. Citizens with scheduled appointments beyond two months or without any appointments do not need to apply prematurely at this stage.

The spokesperson emphasised, ""The HA has repeatedly explained these arrangements to the media and relevant organisations in recent times. The HA deeply regrets that these messages have not been fully understood. We call on all sectors to work together in supporting vulnerable groups in our community.

  In fact, the case cited in the news report demonstrates that when citizens have financial difficulties and require public healthcare services, they can obtain approval for medical fee waivers on the same day even for next-day clinic appointments. The application process is neither complicated nor difficult.""

The spokesperson reiterated that citizens with financial difficulties who do not have scheduled public healthcare services do not need to rush to apply for medical fee waivers, and should not make unnecessary appointments solely for the purpose of obtaining medical fee waivers. Citizens should only apply when they have genuine medical needs and have secured appointments with public healthcare services.

  The HA urges the public to use public resources wisely. People should not make appointments at Family Medicine Clinics or visit Accident and Emergency Departments solely for applying medical fee waivers. These valuable medical resources should be reserved for citizens with genuine medical needs."
醫管局呼籲社區服務團體及市民切勿為申請公共醫療費用減免而濫用急症室及家庭醫學門診服務,2026-02-01 18:01,2026-02-01 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/01/P2026020100551.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

就有傳媒引述社區服務團體指，有市民因未有公立醫院覆診期而未能申請醫療費用減免，醫院管理局（醫管局）發言人今日（二月一日）指出，醫管局一直積極協助合資格市民於使用公營醫療服務前取得醫療費用減免證明書，現時已接受預約診期為兩個月內的病人申請醫療費用減免。預約診期為超過兩個月後或未有任何預約的市民現階段無須急於申請。

發言人強調：「本局在過去一段時間曾多次向傳媒及相關團體解釋以上安排，對相關信息仍未獲充分理解深表遺憾。本局呼籲各界攜手，共同協助弱勢社群。」

「事實上，報道所引述的個案證明，若市民真正有經濟困難，而又需要接受公營醫療服務，即使預約翌日門診，即日已能獲批費用減免，申請減免過程並不複雜，亦不困難。」

發言人重申，未有預約公營醫療服務，而經濟上有困難的市民，不需要急於申請醫療費用減免，亦不應為申請減免而預約不必要的公營醫療服務。市民應待有醫療上需要，並且獲得公營醫療服務預約後才提出申請。

本局呼籲市民善用公共資源，不要只為了申請醫療費用減免而預約家庭醫學門診或衝急症室，應將珍貴的醫療資源留給有真正醫療需要的市民。"
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-02-01 17:30,2026-02-01 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/01/P2026020100527.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（二月一日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————

首宗個案涉及一名55歲女子，居於九龍城區。初步調查顯示，她於一月十九至二十五日到訪塞舌爾，於一月二十七日出現關節痛，翌日出現皮疹。她於一月三十日到威爾斯親王醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療。

另一宗個案涉及一名55歲男子，居於中西區。初步調查顯示，他於一月二十五至二十八日獨自到訪塞舌爾，於一月三十日出現發燒、關節痛和皮疹，昨日（一月三十一日）到私家醫院求醫，其後獲安排到瑪麗醫院，在無蚊環境下接受治療。

兩名病人的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，目前情況穩定。他們各有一名家居接觸者（其中一人亦曾到塞舌爾），暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於兩名病人在潛伏期曾先後到訪塞舌爾，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，會把個案通報當地衞生當局。初步調查顯示兩宗個案沒有流行病學關連。

本港今年累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。


繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-01 17:30,2026-02-01 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/01/P2026020100530.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 1), the CHP has recorded two new imported cases of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
------------------------------

The first case involves a 55-year-old female living in Kowloon City District. Preliminary investigation revealed that she visited the Seychelles from January 19 to 25. She developed joint pain on January 27, followed by rash on the following day. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Prince of Wales Hospital on January 30 and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment.

 The second case involves a 55-year-old male living in Central and Western District. Preliminary investigation revealed that he visited the Seychelles alone from January 25 to 28. He developed a fever, joint pain and rash on January 30. He sought medical attention at a private hospital yesterday (January 31) and was subsequently admitted to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment in a mosquito-free environment.

 The blood samples of the two patients tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. They are now in stable condition. Each patient has one household contact, one of whom also visited the Seychelles. The household contacts are currently asymptomatic and are under medical surveillance.

Asbothpatients visitedtheSeychelles during the incubation period, the CHP considered that the cases were infected during their travels. The cases are classified as imported. The CHP will report the casestothe relevant health authority. Preliminary investigation revealed the two cases are not epidemiologically linked.

Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

尤先生（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室港島工作部副部長尤斌）、佘女士（香港灣仔區各界協會主席佘靜怡）、各位主禮嘉賓、各位業界朋友、各位市民：

大家好！非常高興出席第二屆香港創科節閉幕禮。首先，我衷心感謝主辦單位香港灣仔區各界協會、各協辦及支持機構，以及所有參展單位，攜手打造這場精彩的「社產學研」展覽。

《論語》有云：「知之者不如好之者，好之者不如樂之者。」創新科技要普及，不僅要讓市民「知道」，更要讓大家「喜愛」，甚至「樂在其中」。這次展覽正正是一個生動例子，透過互動展品和體驗攤位，讓大人小朋友都能在趣味中感受科技的魅力。事實上，前沿科技並非遙不可及的抽象概念，而是可以落地生根、觸手可及、切身體驗的生活拍檔。

今年是國家「十五五」規劃的開局之年，「十五五」規劃建議再次明確支持香港建設國際創科中心，並提出加快高水平科技自立自強。一如以往，香港特區政府將全力配合國家發展策略，推動科技創新和產業創新融合發展，更好融入和服務國家發展大局。

特區政府致力構建完整的創科生態系統，創造更廣闊的發展機遇。香港創科發展剛迎來重要里程碑，河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區（河套香港園區）去年年底正式開園。河套香港園區定位明確，既是聯通內地與國際的世界級創科樞紐，亦是制度創新與機制對接的重要試驗場。隨着海內外龍頭企業與初創公司陸續進駐，園區將為香港創科注入強勁動力。河套園區亦將為大家，特別是青年人，提供拓展視野與實踐機會，讓香港青年在家門口就能參與國際級科研項目。

今日的閉幕禮，不單是總結成果，更是新的起點，相信各位會帶着對創科的熱情，繼續透過科技連結社區、連結產業、連結未來，共同推動香港成為國家的國際創科中心！多謝大家！"

《論語》有云：「知之者不如好之者，好之者不如樂之者。」創新科技要普及，不僅要讓市民「知道」，更要讓大家「喜愛」，甚至「樂在其中」。這次展覽正正是一個生動例子，透過互動展品和體驗攤位，讓大人小朋友都能在趣味中感受科技的魅力。事實上，前沿科技並非遙不可及的抽象概念，而是可以落地生根、觸手可及、切身體驗的生活拍檔。

今年是國家「十五五」規劃的開局之年，「十五五」規劃建議再次明確支持香港建設國際創科中心，並提出加快高水平科技自立自強。一如以往，香港特區政府將全力配合國家發展策略，推動科技創新和產業創新融合發展，更好融入和服務國家發展大局。

特區政府致力構建完整的創科生態系統，創造更廣闊的發展機遇。香港創科發展剛迎來重要里程碑，河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區（河套香港園區）去年年底正式開園。河套香港園區定位明確，既是聯通內地與國際的世界級創科樞紐，亦是制度創新與機制對接的重要試驗場。隨着海內外龍頭企業與初創公司陸續進駐，園區將為香港創科注入強勁動力。河套園區亦將為大家，特別是青年人，提供拓展視野與實踐機會，讓香港青年在家門口就能參與國際級科研項目。

今日的閉幕禮，不單是總結成果，更是新的起點，相信各位會帶着對創科的熱情，繼續透過科技連結社區、連結產業、連結未來，共同推動香港成為國家的國際創科中心！多謝大家！"
發展局局長出席東江水供港六十周年同樂日致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2026-02-01 13:31,2026-02-01 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/01/P2026020100374.htm,"以下是發展局局長甯漢豪今日（二月一日）在東江水供港六十周年同樂日的致辭全文：

中聯辦葉水球副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室教育科技部副部長）、各位立法會議員、各位嘉賓、各位同事、各位朋友：

大家好！首先，很感謝剛才這麼多位小朋友為我們獻唱，在寒冷的天氣中等待，還記得所有歌詞，而我這個比他們年長許多的姨姨都要拿着稿致辭。首先請大家給點掌聲，謝謝剛才的小朋友。

今日大家一起來到這裏，是東江水供港六十周年一系列活動中其中一項，我們稱為同樂日。六十年來，這項跨越地域的民生工程，不僅是香港供水史上的重要里程碑，更是國家對香港關懷與支持的真實鐵證。

為慶祝及紀念東江水供港六十周年，二○二五年是供港六十周年，發展局和水務署其實自二○二四年九月起，已經以「一脈相連飲水思源」為主題，聯同多個專業及社會團體舉辦一系列的活動，剛才大家在我們的短片中都看到這些一系列活動的花絮。這些活動成功吸引超過400萬人次參加或觀看，例如在去年二月舉辦了「東江水供港探索之旅」中學生內地考察團，讓約90名中學師生認識國家龐大的供水工程；接着在七月舉辦「識水思源」國家水利建設暨文化科技參訪團，跟香港中學的校長及師生，還有工程系大專生、青年工程師等共120多人，到訪了國家重點水利建設。那次我也有幸參與其中，親身聽到我們的年輕人分享他們對東江水供港的認識，以及對國家偉大成就的看法。水務署亦在港舉辦校園巡迴講座，至今已完成逾100場講座。這些活動的成功實有賴在座各位，還有很多今日未能出席的朋友大力支持。大家的努力有效讓市民深刻銘記國家透過東江水對香港所展現的巨大而長遠的支持和關愛。

今日我們迎來一系列紀念活動的另一環節，就是東江水供港六十周年同樂日。其實同事構思這個活動，稱它為同樂日，亦花了一些心思，關鍵在「同」、「樂」二字。首先是「同氣連枝安居樂業」。作為國家不可分離的部分，香港與國家是同氣連枝，就像孩子在母親的關懷滋養下茁壯成長。國家的東江水自一九六五年開始輸往香港，從未間斷地為香港提供足夠和穩定的食水，是香港的生命之源。現時東江水佔全港的食水用量達到七至八成，支撐着香港的經濟和民生，保障了大眾對用水的需求，所以讓我們「安居樂業」。「同氣連枝」，得以讓我們「安居樂業」。

第二是「同根同心知足常樂」。為何是「同根同心」呢？六十年來國家為了確保輸港東江水的水質，限制內地開發東江流域沿線保護區，多年來拒絕了數百個大大小小的投資發展項目，涉及總額超過600億元。為何要拒絕呢？就是為了保障我們的供水能夠穩定，以及最優質的供水。縱使二○二一年東江流域遭遇到六十年一遇的旱情，香港的東江水供應亦沒有受到當年水荒影響。因此，來之不易的東江水實有賴內地同胞本着血濃於水的深厚情誼，默默付出為香港同胞消災解困。所以我們應當如何呢？剛才我說「同根同心知足常樂」，所以我們要「知足」，要格外珍惜每一滴東江水，並且感恩國家對香港無私的厚愛。

第三是「與民同樂」，說的是同樂。東江水供港六十周年紀念活動是全港市民的集體回憶，過去我們的活動有交織合家歡笑臉的東江水專題導賞團和巡迴展覽，剛才大家看到有些片段，看到很多運動健兒揮灑汗水的傳承跑和傳承划艇，亦帶了很多學生到內地參訪，亦有成為社交媒體熱話的舞動水滴展和打卡挑戰等。今日的同樂日除設有攤位遊戲，亦有過往紀念活動相關的展品，讓大家可以一邊玩，一邊回顧過往活動的難忘片段。紀念東江水供港六十周年，不單是紀念一段刻骨銘心的歷史，亦要求我們譜寫一部延綿不絕、生生不息的長篇小說，所以我們會繼續透過公眾和校園教育宣傳「飲水思源」的愛國信息，將相關信息融入中小學常規教育課程及恆常舉辦的活動，例如水務設施導賞團、「惜水學堂」小學教育計劃等，我們會繼續每年舉辦相關展覽，讓市民及學生感念國家對香港的關愛。隨着粵港澳大灣區的建設，香港與內地的合作將更緊密，東江水的故事 — 這部長篇小說，將繼續啓發我們珍惜國家的支持，發揮香港的優勢，共同建設更美好的家園。

我在此祝願今日的同樂日圓滿成功，再一次謝謝大家！"

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-02-01 02:34,2026-02-01 02:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/01/P2026020100074.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（二月一日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-02-01 02:34,2026-02-01 02:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/01/P2026020100075.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (February 1) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.
