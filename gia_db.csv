香港海關於黃大仙破獲一宗懷疑私煙分銷案件（附圖）,2025-09-05 12:20,2025-09-05 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/05/P2025090500357.htm,"香港海關昨日（九月四日）在黃大仙破獲一宗懷疑私煙分銷案件，檢獲約五萬二千支懷疑私煙，估計市值約二十三萬元，應課稅值約十七萬元，並拘捕一名男子。

海關人員昨日下午於黃大仙進行反私煙行動，於富美街截查一名手持環保袋的可疑男子，經搜查後發現一千支懷疑私煙，遂拘捕該名五十五歲報稱廚師的男子。其後，海關人員再於其停泊在附近路邊的私家車上檢獲約五萬一千支懷疑私煙，涉案私家車亦被檢取。

海關會繼續追查私煙的來源，不排除會有更多人被捕。

該名被捕男子已被落案控以「處理應課稅品條例適用的貨品」罪，將於十月八日在九龍城裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據風險評估和情報分析從源頭堵截，並透過針對貯存及分銷販賣多管齊下的執法策略，致力打擊私煙活動。

海關強調買賣私煙同屬違法。根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Hong Kong Customs detects suspected illicit cigarette distribution case in Wong Tai Sin (with photo),2025-09-05 12:20,2025-09-05 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/05/P2025090500361.htm,"Hong Kong Customs detected a suspected illicit cigarette distribution case in Wong Tai Sin yesterday (September 4), seizing about 52 000 suspected illicit cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $230,000 and a duty potential of about $170,000. One man was arrested.

Customs officers conducted an anti-illicit cigarette operation in Wong Tai Sin yesterday afternoon and intercepted a suspicious man carrying a recyclable bag in Fu Mei Street. Upon inspection, 1 000 suspected illicit cigarettes were found, and the 55-year-old man, who claimed to be a cook, was subsequently arrested. Later, Customs officers further seized about 51 000 suspected illicit cigarettes from his private vehicle parked on the nearby roadside. The vehicle was also detained.

Customs will continue to trace the source of the illicit cigarettes. The likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

The arrested man was charged with ""dealing with goods to which the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance applies"" and will appear at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts on October 8.

Customs will continue its risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as through its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storage, distribution and peddling to spare no effort in combating illicit cigarette activities.

Customs stresses that it is an offence to buy or sell illicit cigarettes. Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002).  "
​政務司司長出席粵港澳大灣區禁毒高峰會致辭（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-09-05 11:20,2025-09-05 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/05/P2025090500320.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（九月五日）出席粵港澳大灣區禁毒高峰會的致辭：

尊敬的魏曉軍局長（國家禁毒委員會常務副秘書長、公安部禁毒局局長）、梁瑞國副廳長（廣東省禁毒委員會副主任、廣東省公安廳副廳長）、梁文昌局長（澳門特別行政區政府警察總局局長）、陳世輝局長（新加坡中央肅毒局局長）、李國棟醫生（禁毒常務委員會主席）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！我很高興出席今天的「粵港澳大灣區禁毒高峰會」，與各位嘉賓共聚一堂，為禁毒工作謀劃新的方向。

首先，我代表香港特區政府，非常歡迎國家禁毒委員會、廣東省禁毒委員會和澳門特區政府的代表參加今天的高峰會。我也要特別歡迎新加坡中央肅毒局和全國防止嗜毒理事會的嘉賓訪問香港並參與這個會議，與我們一起分享和交流經驗。

這次論壇是香港禁毒史上的重要里程碑。今年是禁毒常務委員會成立60周年，也是《粵港澳大灣區發展規劃綱要》公布後，第一個連結粵港澳三地的禁毒高峰會，實在是別具意義。

香港特區政府一直嚴肅應對毒品問題，採取多管齊下的策略，從堵截毒品源頭、加強執法，到宣傳教育，全面打擊毒品的禍害。我們也同時為吸毒人士提供戒毒治療和康復服務，協助他們重返社會，回復健康人生。

過去幾十年，香港禁毒工作取得明顯成效。被呈報的吸毒人數較七十年代末大幅下降七成。但我們絕不鬆懈，繼續努力實現「無毒城市」的目標。

面對不斷變化的毒品問題，我們必須與時並進。例如近期無論在內地、香港、澳門、新加坡以至東南亞其他地區都備受關注的新型毒品依托咪酯，香港已經很迅速透過修改法例，把它列為毒品，依法嚴厲打擊；並透過宣傳推廣，教育市民這種毒品的禍害。我們也會繼續加強對新型毒品的監測和研究，及時應對毒品帶來的威脅。

毒品問題是全球共同面對的挑戰，犯罪手法越來越複雜，跨境販毒活動亦層出不窮。禁毒工作需要匯聚多方的力量推進，所以香港特別行政區政府一定要與內地、澳門和其他地區的執法機關保持緊密聯繫，交流情報，甚至採取聯合行動，共同打擊毒品的流通。

去年粵港澳三地採取的聯合行動，成功破獲23宗涉及毒品的案件，截獲超過二點二公噸毒品，拘捕接近100人。今年七月，香港與新加坡交換情報，成功協助新加坡當局破獲一宗跨國販毒罪案。可見各地持續的緊密合作，對堵截毒品流入社區相當重要。


粵港澳大灣區有三種法律制度，社會文化各有特色。今天的高峰會正好提供一個寶貴的交流合作平台，讓各地的專家能夠分享經驗、交流心得，共同探討如何做到更有效的禁毒策略，推進禁毒合作。

最後，我再次感謝各位參與這次的高峰會，並希望高峰會成果豐碩，一同為下一代創造更健康、更安全的生活環境。祝各位身體健康、生活愉快。謝謝大家。"

The amendments aim to enhance consumer protection, facilitate the food trade, and keep local food safety standards on par with international standards.

A Government spokesman said that the Amendment Regulation has taken into account factors such as the metallic contamination standards of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, relevant standards adopted by major sources of food import, local food consumption patterns and dietary practices, and risk assessment results. It adds 27 new maximum levels (MLs) of specified metals (including lead, cadmium and methylmercury) in specified foods (food pairs), and updates nine MLs of lead in the existing relevant food pairs. As a result, the total number of MLs stipulated in the Amendment Regulation has increased from 144 to 171.

To allow the trade sufficient time to adapt to the updated MLs and food safety standards, the Amendment Regulation provides a grace period of 18 months. During the said period, any food product would be deemed compliant as long as it complies wholly with the pre-amendment or revised requirements under the Food Adulteration (Metallic Contamination) Regulations (Cap. 132V). Upon the lapse of the grace period on March 5, 2027, all food must fully comply with the requirements of the Amendment Regulation.

Ombudsman announces results of full investigation into Property Management Services Authority's complaint handling mechanism (with photo),2025-09-05 11:00,2025-09-05 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/05/P2025090400754.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

  The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (September 5) announced the completion of a full investigation into the Property Management Services Authority (PMSA)'s complaint handling mechanism, with 14 recommendations on improvement measures made.

   A statutory body established under the Property Management Services Ordinance, the PMSA is empowered to investigate complaints against licensed property management companies and licensed property management practitioners for suspected disciplinary offences or where it is alleged that they no longer meet any prescribed criteria required for holding a licence. Upon receiving information from a complainant, the PMSA will conduct a preliminary assessment and assign the case to an investigator if an investigation is warranted. The PMSA pledges to conclude complaints within six months upon receipt of sufficient information. During this period, the PMSA will acknowledge receipt within 10 calendar days and give the complainant monthly updates in writing or by other proper means. If the investigation reveals prima facie evidence supporting the complainant's allegations against the complainee, the PMSA will consider initiating disciplinary proceedings.

   Mr Chan said, ""The Office received a complaint in which the complainant alleged that the PMSA had failed to take action against a certain property management company (Company A) in response to her complaint. The complainant also alleged that the PMSA had not provided any substantive replies on the investigation progress or results, other than repeating that the complaint was being followed up in accordance with procedures.

   ""The Office's investigation found that the PMSA had continued its contact, investigation and follow-up with Company A. As the complainant raised further allegations and provided supplementary information on multiple occasions, the PMSA had to seek further information from Company A. The complainant's case involved complex issues, including interpretation of legal provisions and the deed of mutual covenant, tendering procedures, conflict of interest, and disciplinary offences. Given the complexity of the case, it is understandable that the investigation took time.

   ""However, in its acknowledgement letter and interim replies to the complainant, the PMSA merely reiterated that it was following up on her complaint in accordance with procedures, without providing any substantive update. While the PMSA took a longer time in processing the complainant's complaint due to factors including the complexity of the case, for almost a year, the complainant received only repetitive and brief messages, making it difficult for her to know the progress of the investigation. This may have led her to believe that the PMSA had not taken any substantive action at all, which is far from satisfactory.""

   The Office is pleased to note that the PMSA has responded positively to the full investigation and has proactively proposed measures to improve its procedures and mechanism for responding to public complaints. This Office has incorporated the Authority's views into this investigation report. Overall, the Office has made 14 recommendations for improvement to the Authority and all the recommendations have been accepted by the PMSA.

   The recommendations for improvement include:


properly informing complainants through interim replies that more time may be required to process a case if it is complex or involves new allegations or supplementary information;
considering publishing cases, summary of cases or adapted cases via the website or annual report of the PMSA for public and industry reference;
considering revising and formulating performance pledges for investigating and responding to complaints based on the complexity of cases, and announcing any revised and newly formulated performance pledges;
exploring the use of mediation to handle simple complaints wherever possible as a feasible solution for resolving complaints swiftly and amicably; and
stepping up publicity and education to raise awareness of the benefits of mediation, and encouraging voluntary participation of the public and industry to achieve win-win outcomes.


   The full investigation report has been uploaded to the website of the Office of The Ombudsman at www.ombudsman.hk for public information."
Government sells Tai Po site for purpose of electric vehicle fast charging station ,2025-09-05 11:00,2025-09-05 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/05/P2025090200294.htm," The Government announced today (September 5) the sale of Tai Po Town Lot No. 264 at Nos. 1M and 1N Kwong Fuk Road, Tai Po, New Territories, for conversion to a fast charging station (FCS) for electric vehicles (EVs) through public tendering. The tender invitation will close on November 14.

 A spokesperson for the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) said, ""To promote green transformation of vehicles and to achieve zero vehicular emissions and carbon neutrality before 2050, the Government announced that there would be no new registration of fuel-propelled private cars (including hybrid vehicles) in 2035 or earlier. To cope with the rapid demand for charging facilities with the increase of EVs, the Government has expedited the expansion of the charging network for different types of EVs (including commercial EVs). The Government sold through open tender last year the first two petrol filling station (PFS) sites in Kowloon East and New Territories East for FCS purposes. The Government will, subject to actual market needs, select suitable PFS sites for conversion into FCSs in a timely manner.""

 Tai Po Town Lot No. 264 has a site area of about 683.8 square metres and is designated for EV FCS purposes. Land sale documents including the forms of tender, tender notice, conditions of sale and sale plan of the lot are now available on the Lands Department (LandsD) website (www.landsd.gov.hk) for downloading. The sale plan is available for inspection by the public from today until the close of the tender. The sale plan in hard copy form may also be purchased from today until the close of the tender at the Survey and Mapping Office of the LandsD, 6/F, North Point Government Offices, 333 Java Road, North Point, Hong Kong. The particulars of the tender have also been gazetted today.

 The spokesperson continued, ""In order to encourage owners of taxis and public light buses to expedite the adoption of electric taxis (e-taxis) and electric public light buses (e-PLBs), and by reference to the current arrangement of dedicated liquefied petroleum gas filling stations, a charging ceiling price mechanism will be established for e-taxis and e-PLBs at designated FCSs. The operators of designated FCSs cannot charge a price that is higher than the ceiling price to be announced by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on a monthly basis. The charging price for other EVs will be determined by the market. For details about the calculation of charging ceiling prices for e-taxis and e-PLBs, please refer to the EEB website (www.eeb.gov.hk/sites/default/files/en/node78/Ceiling_price_calculation_e.pdf).""

 Details of the charging ceiling price will be announced regularly on the EPD website (www.epd.gov.hk) and the ""EV-Charging Easy"" app when the designated FCSs are in operation. In addition, the charging ceiling price will be posted at each FCS to enable trade practitioners to monitor the changes in charging prices."

是次出售的大埔市地段第264號地盤面積為683.8平方米，指定作電動車高速充電站用途。該幅土地的賣地文件，包括投標表格、招標公告、賣地條件及賣地圖則，已上載至地政總署網頁（www.landsd.gov.hk）供公眾人士下載；賣地圖則會由即日起至截標前供公眾人士查閱。公眾亦可於即日起至截標前到香港北角渣華道333號北角政府合署6樓地政總署測繪處購買賣地圖則印刷本。招標詳情亦已於今日刊憲。

申訴專員公署公布就物業管理業監管局處理及回覆巿民投訴的程序和機制的全面調查報告（附圖）,2025-09-05 11:00,2025-09-05 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/05/P2025090400750.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出︰

申訴專員陳積志今日（九月五日）宣布公署完成物業管理業監管局（物監局）處理及回覆巿民投訴的程序和機制的全面調查，並向物監局提出共14項改善建議。

物監局是根據《物業管理服務條例》成立的法定機構。根據該條例，物監局可就涉嫌干犯違紀行為或不再符合持有牌照所須符合的任何訂明準則的投訴，對持牌物業管理公司及持牌物業管理人進行調查。在接獲投訴人提供的資料後，物監局會進行初步評估，如決定就投訴事宜展開調查，個案會交由該局委任的調查員進行調查。物監局一般在收到足夠資料後起計六個月內完成處理投訴，期間會在首十個曆日內認收及其後每一個月以書面或其他合適的方式通知投訴人相關進度。物監局經調查後如認為有表面證據支持投訴人對被投訴人作出的指稱，會考慮對有關事宜進行紀律聆訊。

陳積志表示：「公署接獲申訴人指物監局在接獲她的投訴後沒有對某物業管理公司（公司甲）採取行動，亦沒有實質回覆她調查進展和結果，只重複回覆稱正按程序跟進該投訴。」

「公署調查發現，物監局在收到申訴人的投訴後，已持續聯絡公司甲調查和跟進，並因應申訴人多次提供的進一步投訴和補充資料，向公司甲索取更多資料。而申訴人的投訴涉及法例及公契條文的詮釋、招標程序、利益衝突和違紀行為等多個範疇，物監局因為案情複雜而需時向公司甲索取資料及作出調查，公署認為屬可以理解。」

「然而，物監局在致申訴人的認收函件和簡覆中，只重複地告知申訴人正按程序跟進她的投訴，並無實質交代個案進展。雖然該局因個案複雜等因素而需較長時間處理，但申訴人在物監局近一年調查期間只收到內容重複的簡單信息，對她而言，實難以得知調查進展，甚至可能認為該局並沒實質跟進行動，情況有欠理想。」

公署欣悉物監局對公署的全面調查持正面態度，並就投訴處理主動提出措施改善回覆市民的程序和機制。公署已把該局的意見納入調查報告。整體而言，公署對物監局提出14項改善建議。物監局同意公署提出的所有改善建議。

公署向物監局提出的主要改善建議包括：


在簡覆內適當地通知投訴人，如投訴複雜、投訴人新增投訴事項或補充資料，物監局可能需較長時間處理；
考慮在該局網頁或年報等公布投訴個案或個案摘錄或改編個案，供公眾和業界參考；
考慮按個案的不同複雜程度修訂和制訂調查及回覆投訴人的服務承諾，並在修訂和制訂服務承諾後向公眾公布；
考慮盡量以調解方式處理簡單投訴，探討可行的方案快速及平和地解決投訴；以及
加強宣傳和教育，讓公眾及業界了解調解的好處，鼓勵他們自願參與調解，達致雙贏。


全面調查報告已上載至申訴專員公署網頁www.ombudsman.hk供公眾參閱。"

第五份合約涵蓋四個改裝校舍項目，將會分兩個階段落成入伙，第一階段為位於順安道和彩園路的兩個項目（即觀塘順安邨基督教聖約教會堅樂第二小學和上水彩園邨東華三院馬錦燦紀念小學（彩園分校）），分別提供約130及約110個單位，預計今年第四季落成；第二階段為位於順利邨道和竹園道的兩個項目（即觀塘順安邨迦密梁省德學校和黃大仙竹園南邨浸信會天虹小學），分別提供約110及約105個單位，預計二○二七年第一季落成。

第六份合約則涵蓋柴灣常安街項目，提供約1 720個單位，預計明年第二季落成。

房屋局局長何永賢表示：「在房屋局主導下，元朗攸壆路及牛頭角彩興路『簡約公屋』項目已經全面入伙，充分反映租金便宜、配套服務齊全、居住環境更好的『簡約公屋』項目相當受有需要的市民歡迎。另外，屯門青福里及啟德世運道（第一期）兩個項目的資格審核工作亦正全速進行，預計於今年第四季落成，並開始分階段入伙。隨着我們今次委任第五及第六個『簡約公屋』的營運機構，標誌着這項社會工程進一步邁向成熟階段，將有更多市民受惠。」

她續說：「今次批出兩份合約的項目各有特色，第一份合約涵蓋四個改裝校舍項目，雖然分布於不同區域，但在協同效應下，由一個營運機構整體營運管理，可達致資源共享互通，提高相關工作的成本效益。第二份合約涵蓋柴灣常安街項目，為唯一座落於港島區的『簡約公屋』項目。我期望營運機構透過高質素的物業管理和精準到位的社會服務，讓住戶以至附近地區居民都能受惠。因此，我呼籲其他有志參與營運『簡約公屋』的機構踴躍參與投標其他項目，與政府攜手改善基層生活環境，幫助更多有需要的市民走向幸福。」

「簡約公屋」項目除提供住屋外，亦會為住戶及地區提供不同服務和設施。因此，有關營運及管理服務要求有別於一般物業管理合約，不但包括住戶事務管理、物業管理、日常保養維修，亦涵蓋一系列社會服務，以及管理和營運配套設施。

為確保服務質素，房屋局在評審過程中，會根據投標機構的管理能力、相關經驗，以及計劃書內建議的營運和管理模式、提供的社會服務、遷出計劃、創新和資訊科技的應用等一系列因素作出技術評審，然後再就投標價格作出綜合評審，從而挑選最合適的營運機構。

行政長官提出興建約30 000個「簡約公屋」單位，房屋局和建築署團隊一直全速推進相關工作，本年合共約9500個單位落成，明年約兩萬個單位落成，預計最後一批單位將於二○二七年第一季落成。「簡約公屋」的申請反應相當踴躍，截至今年八月底共收到約26 400份申請。有迫切住屋需要的合資格市民，可以把握機會盡快申請，早日改善生活環境。"
Housing Bureau awards two operation and management contracts of Light Public Housing projects (with photos),2025-09-05 10:30,2025-09-05 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/05/P2025090400655.htm,"âThe Housing Bureau (HB) yesterday (September 4) awarded the fifth and the sixth operation and management contracts of the Light Public Housing (LPH) projects (Contract No. LPH20250002 and LPH20250003) to Chevalier Property Management Limited and Sik Sik Yuen Joint Venture; and the joint venture of Creative Property Services Consultants Limited and Pok Oi Hospital, at tender sums of about $86 million and $123 million respectively.

The fifth contract covers the four LPH projects converted from school premises, which are to be completed for intake in two phases. The first phase includes the two projects at Shun On Road and Choi Yuen Road (i.e. the Mission Covenant Church Holm Glad No. 2 Primary School in Shun On Estate, Kwun Tong; and Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Ma Kam Chan Memorial Primary School (Choi Yuen Annex) in Choi Yuen Estate, Sheung Shui) which will provide about 130 and 110 units respectively and are expected for completion in the fourth quarter of this year. The second phase includes the two projects at Shun Lee Tsuen Road and Chuk Yuen Road (i.e. Carmel Leung Sing Tak School in Shun On Estate, Kwun Tong; and Baptist Rainbow Primary School in Chuk Yuen South Estate, Wong Tai Sin), which will provide about 110 and 105 units respectively and are expected for completion in the first quarter of 2027.

The sixth contract covers the project at Sheung On Street, Chai Wan, which will provide about 1 720 units and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of next year.

The Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, said, ""Under the leadership of the HB, the tenant intakes for the LPH projects at Yau Pok Road, Yuen Long, and Choi Hing Road, Ngau Tau Kok, have been completed. This fully demonstrates that with affordable rent, comprehensive facilities and services, as well as a better living environment, LPH projects are highly popular among residents in need. Meanwhile, the eligibility vetting process of the two projects at Tsing Fuk Lane, Tuen Mun and Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak (Phase 1) is in full swing, with both anticipated for completion in the fourth quarter of this year for gradual intake. With the appointment of the fifth and sixth operating organisations for LPH, this social project has taken a further step towards maturity, and more people in need will benefit from the LPH.

  ""The projects under the two awarded contracts have their own unique features. The first contract covers the four school conversion projects. Although they are located in different areas, with the synergy through engagement of a single operating organisation for the overall operation and management, sharing of resources can be achieved, thereby enhancing the cost-effectiveness of work. The second contract covers the project at Sheung On Street, Chai Wan, which is the only LPH project on Hong Kong Island. I expect that our residents and the neighbourhood will benefit from the high-quality property management service and targeted social services. With this in mind, I would like to appeal to other organisations that are interested in operating LPH projects to actively participate in the tenders for other projects, and work together with the Government to improve the living environment of grassroots citizens and help them in their pursuit of happiness,"" she added.

In addition to providing accommodation, the LPH projects will also offer various services and facilities for the residents and local community. Therefore, unlike general property management contracts, the requirements for LPH's operation and management services not only cover occupant management, property management, and daily maintenance, but also a range of social services, as well as the management and operation of ancillary facilities.

To ensure service quality, the HB has, in the assessment process, carried out a technical assessment based on a series of criteria including the management capability and relevant experience of the tenderers, as well as the proposed modes of operation and management, social services to be provided, exit plan and the use of innovation and information technology. The tender price was then comprehensively evaluated to decide on the most suitable operating organisation.

The Chief Executive introduced the construction of about 30 000 LPH units. The HB and the Architectural Services Department have been working at full steam to take forward the related works. A total of about 9 500 units will be completed this year, followed by about 20 000 units next year, and the last batch of units is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2027. The response to the LPH application has been overwhelming, with about 26 400 applications received by the end of August. Eligible persons with imminent housing needs are encouraged to seize the opportunity to apply early to improve their living conditions."

勞工處提醒僱主及僱員在工作暑熱警告生效期間採取預防中暑措施,2025-09-05 10:00,2025-09-05 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/05/P2025090500268.htm,"由於工作暑熱警告現已生效，勞工處提醒僱主及僱員在警告生效期間採取適當措施，以預防在酷熱天氣下或高溫環境中工作而引致中暑。

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

勞工處發布的《預防工作時中暑指引》，詳細說明進行熱壓力風險評估時應考慮的各項風險因素，並針對各風險因素建議相應的控制措施，供僱主和僱員參閱。有關工作暑熱警告及相關指引，請參閱勞工處專題網頁：www.labour.gov.hk/tc/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm。"

Legislative amendments for mandating fitting and wearing of seat belts and regulating use of mobile telecommunications devices while driving gazetted,2025-09-05 10:00,2025-09-05 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/05/P2025090400496.htm,"  The Government published in the Gazette today (September 5) the Road Traffic (Construction and Maintenance of Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulation 2025, the Road Traffic (Safety Equipment) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 and the Road Traffic (Traffic Control) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulation 2025 (Amendment Regulations), with a view to further enhancing road safety.

  The Amendment Regulations cover two arrangements, including:


extending the mandatory fitting and wearing of seat belts to all newly registered public transport vehicles and commercial vehicles (including buses, private light buses, goods vehicles and special purpose vehicles) and their seats.Where seats are equipped with seat belts, passengers must wear them; furthermore, all student service vehicles (including existing and newly registered vehicles) will be required to be fitted with seat belts and safer seats to enhance the protection for young students; and
strengthening the regulations for drivers'use of mobile telecommunications devices (including mobile phones, tablets and laptops) while driving.Restrictions will be imposed on the number of devices (no more than two), screen size (each screen's diagonal length not exceeding 19 centimetres) and placement of the device (not obstructing the driver's view of the road and traffic conditions and not interfering with the line of sight to mirrors, devices or camera displays used for observing road conditions), thereby enhancing driver safety.


  A spokesperson for the Transport and Logistics Bureau said, ""The two amendments aim to enhance the safety of passengers travelling on public transport and commercial vehicles, as well as the safety of using mobile telecommunications devices while driving. In formulating the Amendment Regulations, the Government has struck an appropriate balance among road safety, the operational needs of the transport trades and technological developments.""

  The Government has considered the views put forward by various stakeholders, including the Legislative Council Panel on Transport, the Transport Advisory Committee and representatives of the transport trades. Details of the regulatory regime and commencement dates are specified in the respective Amendment Regulations, with relevant information featured in the Legislative Council Brief issued by the Government yesterday (September 4).

  The Amendment Regulations will be tabled before the Legislative Council on September 10 for the negative vetting procedure."
LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-09-05 10:00,2025-09-05 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/05/P2025090500269.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

天氣酷熱　衞生署提醒市民預防高溫引發的疾病,2025-09-05 06:46,2025-09-05 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/05/P2025090500016.htm,"天氣酷熱，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月五日）提醒市民，應採取適當措施預防高溫引發的疾病，例如熱痙攣、熱衰竭和中暑。

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

市民可透過以下途徑，取得更多資料：衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111）、中暑專頁、紫外線專頁；天文台「打電話問天氣」（1878 200）、最新天氣報告及預報、紫外線指​數、遠足及攀山天氣資訊；及勞工處於工作暑熱警告生效期間，對戶外工作的僱員和其僱主發布有關預防中暑措施的新聞公報。"
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-05 06:46,2025-09-05 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/05/P2025090500013.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 5) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

Labour Department highly concerned about fatal work accident that happened in Kwu Tung today,2025-09-04 22:12,2025-09-04 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400863.htm,"âThe Labour Department (LD) is highly concerned about a fatal work accident that happened at a construction site in Kwu Tung this morning (September 4), in which a male worker fell from height while installing metal mould at the external wall of a building under construction. He was certified dead later in hospital. The LD is saddened by death of the worker and expresses its deepest sympathy to his family.

The LD's spokesman said, ""We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and have issued suspension notices to the contractors concerned, suspending the fixing work of metal mould at the site. The contractors cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that suitable measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken.""

The spokesman added, ""We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation.""

To prevent workers from falling while working at height, the LD reminds employers to take suitable safety measures, including providing workers with suitable working platforms and ensuring that the platforms are properly used by workers throughout the work. If the provision of working platforms is not practicable, employers should provide suitable full-body harnesses to workers, which should be attached continuously to suitable and secure anchor points or independent lifelines with fall arresting system to protect workers' work-at-height safety.

The general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance require employers to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

In regard to today's accident, the LD will issue a Work Safety Alert through its mobile application ""OSH 2.0"", website and email, giving a brief account of the accident concerned to duty holders, workers' unions, professional bodies of safety practitioners and others, and reminding the industry of the importance of following safety precautionary measures to prevent a recurrence of similar accidents.

The LD will also remind the employer concerned of the liability for employees' compensation under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, assist family members of the deceased to claim employees' compensation and closely follow up on the case. For those with financial difficulties, the LD will assist them to apply for appropriate emergency funds. Subject to the needs and wishes of family members of the deceased, the LD will also liaise with the Social Welfare Department for financial or other assistance.

For the sake of securing the safety and health of employees at work, the LD appeals to employers to provide plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health. Employees should also co-operate with their employers, adopt all safety measures and use personal protective equipment provided properly to avoid endangering their own work safety and that of other workers."

AIA International Hot Air Balloon Fest Hong Kong is a commercial event. It is not organised, co-organised or funded by the Government. The content and arrangements of the event are designed and implemented by the organiser.

Following the organiser's notification to organise a hot air balloon event, relevant government departments have communicated with the organiser through multiple meetings. They provided professional advice, details and requirements for applying for necessary licences and permits, and participated in on-site hot air balloon demonstrations.

The organiser bears responsibility for ensuring the event's safe execution, including conducting and arranging demonstration to ensure the event complies with all licence and permit specifications and requirements to secure approvals from relevant departments.

The organiser conducted an on-site hot air balloon demonstration on August 20, but the results were unsatisfactory. Relevant departments observed that the hot air balloon operation was highly susceptible to wind strength and direction, with instances of difficulty in stabilising control occurring on-site, posing significant safety risks.

Throughout the approval process, the government prioritised safety while endeavouring to facilitate the smooth staging of the event.

The organiser conducted another demonstration yesterday (September 3, the day before the event). After cautious and comprehensive consideration of public safety, relevant government department approved the display of hot air balloons. However, given insufficient time to conduct another demonstration of passenger carriage to assess its safety, the approval does not include the carriage of passengers."

友邦香港國際熱氣球節是一項商業活動，而非政府主辦、協辦或資助的活動。活動的內容和安排均由主辧機構設計及落實推行。

活動主辦方向政府表示會舉辦熱氣球活動後，各有關政府部門透過多次會議與主辦方溝通，提供專業意見、各項申請所需牌照及許可的細則及要求，以及參與實地熱氣球升降示範等。

熱氣球活動主辦方有責任確保活動安全進行，並負責及安排測試，確保活動符合各項所需牌照及許可的細則及要求，以取得相關部門的批准。

主辦方在八月二十日曾進行實地熱氣球測試，但效果未如理想。各相關部門觀察到熱氣球運作極受風力及風向影響，現場曾出現難以穩定控制的情況，安全風險顯著。

政府在審批過程中，始終將安全放在首位，同時盡力協助活動申請順利進行。

主辦方昨日（九月三日，即活動舉辦前一天）進行另一次測試。政府相關部門經審慎並全面考慮公眾的安全情況下，批准熱氣球展示，但考慮到未有足夠時間再次進行載客測試，以評估其安全性，因此有關批准並不包括接載乘客。"
CHP investigates suspected ciguatoxin poisoning case cluster,2025-09-04 20:45,2025-09-04 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400809.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (September 4) investigating a suspected ciguatoxin poisoning case cluster, involving two patients who consumed marine fish.

A 61-year-old female and a 70-year-old male bought coral trout at the Hung Hom Market yesterday (September 3). They cooked and ate the fish at home. About three hours later, both of them developed nausea and diarrhoea. The female patient also developed symptoms of ciguatoxin poisoning, including facial and limb numbness. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital, and remains hospitalised. She is in serious condition. Symptoms of the male patient are mild and he did not experience numbness. He did not seek medical advice.

The CHP notified the Centre for Food Safety of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department of the case.

Ciguatoxin poisoning is mainly associated with the consumption of large coral reef fish that prey on small fish in coral reef areas. The small fish may have consumed toxic algae. The toxins accumulate in large coral reef fish, particularly in their internal organs. Larger fish may contain higher levels of toxins. It is difficult to tell whether a fish is toxic based on its appearance. Cooking the fish does not break down the toxin.

People affected by ciguatoxin poisoning may have symptoms such as numbness in the mouth and limbs, vomiting, diarrhoea, alternating sensations of coldness and hotness, and joint and muscle pain.

While most people affected by ciguatoxin do not suffer from long-term effects, excessive toxin intake can affect the circulatory and nervous systems. To prevent ciguatoxin poisoning, the public should:

• Eat less coral reef fish;
• Eat small portions of coral reef fish at a time, and avoid having a ""whole fish feast"" in which all the dishes may come from a single large coral reef fish;
• Avoid eating the head, skin, intestines and roe of coral reef fish, as these parts usually accumulate more toxins;
• Refrain from consuming alcohol, peanuts or beans when eating coral reef fish to prevent aggravating ciguatoxin poisoning;
• Seek medical treatment immediately should symptoms of ciguatoxin poisoning appear; and
• Buy coral reef fish from reputable seafood vendors. Do not buy fish of an unknown origin."
衞生防護中心調查懷疑「雪卡毒」食物中毒個案,2025-09-04 20:45,2025-09-04 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400810.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（九月四日）正調查一宗懷疑因進食海魚引致「雪卡毒」食物中毒個案，涉及兩名病人。

一名61歲女子及一名70歲男子昨日（九月三日）在紅磡街市購買星斑，其後在家中烹煮及食用。約三小時後，兩人皆出現噁心和腹瀉，女病人同時出現面部和四肢麻痺等「雪卡毒」中毒病徵。該名女病人到廣華醫院急症室求醫，目前仍然留醫，情況嚴重。男病人病徵輕微，沒有出現麻痺等症狀，他亦沒有求醫。

衞生防護中心已將個案通知食物環境衞生署食物安全中心。

「雪卡毒」食物中毒主要與進食大珊瑚魚有關。這類大魚會吃珊瑚礁海域的小魚，而小魚則可能會吃有毒海藻，毒素會積聚在大珊瑚魚體內，特別是內臟。魚越大，含毒量亦可能越高。單從魚的外觀難以分辨魚是否含有毒素。烹煮魚肉亦不能將毒素分解。

受「雪卡毒」影響人士可能會出現口及四肢麻痺、嘔吐、腹瀉、冷熱感覺顛倒及關節和肌肉痛等病徵。

大部分「雪卡毒」中毒人士都不會有長遠後遺症，但攝取過多毒素可影響循環及神經系統。要預防雪卡毒素中毒，市民應：

• 減少進食珊瑚魚；
• 每次只進食少量珊瑚魚，避免全魚宴，以免食材來自同一大珊瑚魚；
• 進食珊瑚魚時，避免吃頭、魚皮、內臟和魚卵等積聚較多毒素的部位；
• 進食珊瑚魚時，勿同時飲酒、食花生或豆類，以防加重病情；
• 一旦出現病徵，應及早治理；及
• 應在信譽良好的海鮮檔購買珊瑚魚，不要購買來歷不明的魚。

Speech by SCST at Closing Panel of World Football Summit Hong Kong 2025 (English only),2025-09-04 19:30,2025-09-04 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400743.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the Closing Panel of the World Football Summit Hong Kong 2025 today (September 4):

Mr Jan Alessie (Co-founder and Managing Director of the World Football Summit), Eric (Chairman of the Football Association of Hong Kong, China, Mr Eric Fok), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon, and it is my great pleasure to finally join you at this Closing Panel of the World Football Summit. I actually came back from Beijing late last night to make myself available for at least the closing part of this important summit, which is a fitting final act of a thrilling international football season or football summer here in Hong Kong. So allow me to say really more than a few words, because this is the only opportunity that I can speak to such a distinguished audience. Let me first extend my very warmest welcome to all influential football stakeholders who gathered here for the first time in Hong Kong to share insightful views on trends in the global football industry. I hope everyone had fruitful and rewarding exchanges at the two-day Summit, filled with multiple panels on a wide range of topics.

Asia stands today as the world's largest and fastest-growing football market, driven by large fan bases and rapidly expanding sponsorship opportunities. Over the last two days, many useful exchanges should have taken place on how such positive features could be utilised to better shape the future of football in Asia, both commercially and in terms of elevating the standard and quality of football in this part of the world. In this connection, I trust you also have had a glimpse of why Hong Kong stands out in Asia as holding the keys to football's regional future. But do please allow me to share a few of my views on the strengths of Hong Kong and our collective offering.

First, Hong Kong has the infrastructure. The Kai Tak Sports Park, the US$4-billion, largest-ever sports and entertainment infrastructure that the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government has ever invested in, was commissioned officially in March this year. Some of you, such as friends from Tottenham Hotspur who played at Kai Tak Stadium just five weeks ago, and if, on top of football you are also rugby fans, you would have already experienced the state-of-the-art high-tech hardware in this 50 000-strong capacity Stadium. From what I have heard thus far from the teams that have played in the Stadium, reviews on Kai Tak Stadium since its debut have been very positive.

In just seven months since its commissioning, we have already hosted matches including Liverpool (FC), Arsenal and Spurs from the English Premier League, AC Milan from Serie A and the India national team. At the risk of ""over-marketing"", Kai Tak Stadium is an all-weather, fully air-conditioned venue, which you would especially appreciate over Hong Kong's very hot summer.

In addition to Kai Tak Stadium, the 40 000-seat Hong Kong Stadium, which some of you may have visited in the past, has also played host to a number of important football matches this year. The annual Guangdong - Hong Kong Cup and Chinese New Year Cup featuring Legends from major European leagues in the first quarter of 2025; Manchester United, my favourite but struggling team, versus the Hong Kong, China Representative Team in May; and the series of exciting games of Saudi Super Cup in August, all took place at Hong Kong Stadium, which might be less eye-catching technology-wise, but more than compensated for its nostalgic value and central location of being only a few steps away from the bustling Causeway Bay and Wan Chai area.

Together, these two large-scale venues now provide the perfect conditions for Hong Kong to serve as a launchpad of Asia's football development.

Second, Hong Kong has the market. Located at the centre of Asia, where the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is home to more than 87 million people, where the rest of China and most East and Southeast Asian countries, which are home to half of the world's population, are within hours' flight time, and where more direct flights from locations, such as Riyadh, to Hong Kong are now in operation, Hong Kong has a unique global appeal to Asian markets in the world of premium international football. With our proximity to the Mainland of China, which has the largest football fan base in the world, Hong Kong is a natural gateway for clubs, federations and investors seeking collaboration opportunities across the Mainland market. And if you have just joined one of the games I mentioned just now, you will testify to the electrifying atmosphere, created by our civilised, but raving at all times fans, and agree with me that it is like the best party in the world.

On top of the games themselves, Hong Kong's world-class tourism infrastructure, featuring a wide range of luxurious to value-for-money hotels, diverse dining options at different price points, and one of the most efficient transportation systems in the world, provides the ideal environment for hosting large-scale football events that can, most important of all, draw regional and international visitors, but also an attractive vacation destination for players, staff and their families.

Now let the numbers speak for themselves. The depth and breadth of our market is best showcased by the popularity of the several key football matches held in Hong Kong this year. The first-ever overseas North London Derby, featuring Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, held in Hong Kong on July 31, attracted a record-breaking attendance of 49 975. The series of matches in the Saudi Super Cup, which is a relatively new brand for fans in this part of the world, has achieved an aggregated attendance of over 80 000; a great number of them are actually fans from the Middle East and elsewhere.

Hong Kong's third point of strength lies with our proven expertise in organising international matches and mega events. Eric, our Chairman of the Football Association of Hong Kong, China, will of course be even better placed to share with you the experts and professionals we possess in Hong Kong. But I believe I will sound convincing enough when I point you to the consecutive successes of all the important football matches in Hong Kong that are staged this year and the wonderful reports, social media posts and photos that accompanied these matches.

Last but not least, I should state to you clearly the commitment of the Hong Kong SAR Government in supporting football development. We invest in venues. We invest in youth training. We also invest in cultivating spectators. The solid partnership between the Government and HKFA (Football Association of Hong Kong, China) under Eric's leadership provides a super-effective platform for the football industry to thrive.

Ladies and gentlemen, I can go on to talk more, such as about broadcast innovation, advanced technologies, live-streaming platforms, etc, which of course adds a lot of value to driving football development in Hong Kong and elsewhere. But you need to just take away these important points, and remember Hong Kong's world-class infrastructure, huge international market, our proven capability and the positive attitude and commitment of the Hong Kong SAR Government. Joining our hands together, we will shape the future and drive the growth of football as both a sport and an industry in Asia.

On this note, I thank you all for joining us at this rewarding Summit and wish you an enjoyable stay in Hong Kong.

Thank you."

Hong Kong and Jordan enter into tax pact (with photos),2025-09-04 18:48,2025-09-04 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400605.htm,"The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, had a bilateral meeting with the Ambassador of Jordan to China, Mr Hussam Al Husseini, in Beijing today (September 4) and signed on behalf of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government a comprehensive avoidance of double taxation agreement (CDTA) with the Government of Jordan. Mr Hui said that the signing of the CDTA demonstrated Hong Kong's continuous efforts in deepening co-operation with Belt and Road countries, and is an excellent starting point to enhance the financial, economic and trade connections between Hong Kong and Jordan.

At the bilateral meeting, Mr Hui presented toMr Hussam Al Husseini the advantages and latest developments of Hong Kong's financial market, including the efforts made to promote the continuous vibrant development of the financial market and establish Hong Kong as an international gold trading centre.

Mr Hui said, ""Jordan is a participant in the Belt and Road Initiative. The CDTA signifies the determination of the HKSAR Government in expanding Hong Kong's CDTA network and its enhanced collaboration with tax jurisdictions participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.

""The CDTA sets out the allocation of taxing rights between Hong Kong and Jordan, which will help investors better assess their potential tax liabilities from cross-border economic activities. I have every confidence that it will be an excellent starting point to enhance the financial, economic and trade connections between the two places. This CDTA is the 53rd one that Hong Kong has concluded. We will continue to expand Hong Kong's CDTA network to enhance the city's attractiveness as a business and investment hub, and consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international economic and trade centre.""

In accordance with the newly signed CDTA, Hong Kong residents can avoid double taxation in that any tax paid in Jordan will be allowed as a credit against the tax payable in Hong Kong in respect of the same income, subject to the provisions of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112).

Moreover, Jordan's withholding tax rates for Hong Kong residents on dividends, interest and royalties, currently at up to 10 per cent, will be capped at 5 per cent.

The Hong Kong-Jordan CDTA will come into force after completion of ratification procedures by both sides. In Hong Kong, the Chief Executive in Council will make an order under the Inland Revenue Ordinance, which will be tabled at the Legislative Council for negative vetting. Details of the CDTA are available on the Inland Revenue Department's website.

Mr Hui will return to Hong Kong this evening."
Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025 to be gazetted tomorrow,2025-09-04 18:45,2025-09-04 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400692.htm,"The Government will gazette the Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025 tomorrow (September 5), with an aim of introducing a regulatory regime for ride-hailing services to safeguard the public's travel safety.

A spokesperson for the Transport and Logistics Bureau said today (September 4), ""The current-term Government is determined to reform personalised point-to-point transport services. In addition to actively introducing various measures to enhance taxi services over the past few years, the Government proposes to introduce a clear legislative framework to regulate ride-hailing services, demonstrating our resolution to address the long-standing controversy.""

""In devising the regulatory framework, the Government has prioritised public safety and interests, and listened carefully to the views of various stakeholders with a view to achieving the objective of 'people-oriented and safe travel'. Our aim is to provide the public with more safe, legally compliant and diverse travel options, while ensuring the healthy and orderly development of the overall point-to-point transport service industry and creating a healthy competitive environment. This will help bring new vitality to the industry and achieve a win-win outcome for all parties. Moreover, the Government also proposes introducing new measures to combat illegal activities of carrying passengers for hire or reward,"" the spokesperson added.

Under the proposed regulatory regime, platforms, vehicles and drivers providing ride-hailing services must obtain appropriate licences/permits and meet the licence/permit conditions imposed by the Transport Department. The Government will set entry thresholds (including being a company registered in Hong Kong, operational experience, proof of financial capacity, capital investment, and directors' qualifications) for platforms applying for operation. Platforms must also maintain appropriate and efficient services and conduct due diligence on their vehicles and drivers. Regarding ride-hailing vehicles, the Government proposes that vehicles must be registered in the name of an individual and can only be operated by their registered owners. Also, ride-hailing vehicles must hold appropriate third-party risk insurance and display identification markings as required for identification purposes. For ride-hailing vehicle drivers, the Government proposes that applicants must meet a series of conditions and complete a specified test. These conditions include being at least 21 years of age, holding a Hong Kong permanent identity card, and having no serious traffic conviction records within the five years preceding the application date.

The spokesperson said, ""In July this year, the Government consulted the Legislative Council (LegCo) Panel on Transport on the legislative proposals for the regulatory framework. Members unanimously supported the Government's proposal to regulate platforms, vehicles and drivers providing ride-hailing services. They also endorsed the Government's approach to first introduce amendments to the principal legislation into the LegCo to establish matters of principle and handle other technical details in the next stage through subsidiary legislation or licence/permit conditions, with a view to expediting the regulation of ride-hailing services and meeting public expectations.

""We would like to thank the LegCo Members for their support for the Government to take forward the legislative work on regulating ride-hailing services at full speed.

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-04 18:22,2025-09-04 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400698.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (September 4), nonew cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

  ""According to the World Health Organization, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks this year, and as of July this year, over 240 000 cases had been reported in 16 countries/regions worldwide. Of these cases, about 90 were fatal. High temperatures and rainfall levels in summer continue to pose a risk of outbreaks of various mosquito-borne diseases in Hong Kong and around the world, and members of the public must remain vigilant. They must take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have a travel history,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 13 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The FEHD continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising them on mosquito-borne disease prevention and tips on travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. Moreover, the Visiting Health Teams have also reminded all residential care homes for the elderly in Hong Kong to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of mosquito-borne diseases.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite (www.chp.gov.hk/en/static/104022.html).

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

運輸及物流局發言人今日（九月四日）說：「今屆政府銳意改革個人化點對點交通服務，除了在過去數年積極推出多項改善的士服務的措施，亦建議引入清晰的法律框架規管網約車服務，決心處理多年以來引起的爭議。」

發言人續說：「政府在訂定規管框架時，一直將市民的安全和利益放於首位，並仔細聆聽了各持份者的意見，希望做到以民為本、安全出行。我們的目標是為市民提供更多安全、合法合規和多元化的出行選擇，同時兼顧整體點對點交通服務業的健康和有序發展，締造良性競爭環境，以期為行業帶來全新氣象，達致多方共贏。另外，政府亦建議引入新措施，以便更有效打擊非法出租或取酬載客活動。」

在擬議的規管制度下，提供網約車服務的平台、車輛及司機均須領取合適的牌證，並滿足運輸署所施加的牌證條件。政府將就申請營運的平台設立入場門檻（包括須為在香港註冊公司、營運經驗、財力證明、資本投入、董事資格等），平台亦須維持適當且具效率的服務，並對旗下車輛和司機進行盡職審查。網約車方面，政府建議車輛須由個人名義登記並只能由登記車主提供服務；而車輛須持有合適的第三者風險保險以及按規定展示標識以供識別。至於網約車司機方面，政府建議申請人須符合一系列條件及完成指定考核。有關條件包括年滿21歲及持有香港永久性居民身分證，以及在申請日期前五年內無嚴重交通定罪紀錄等。

發言人表示：「政府於今年七月就有關規管框架的立法建議諮詢立法會交通事務委員會，議員一致支持政府就提供網約車服務的平台、車輛及司機作出規管，亦支持政府先向立法會提交主體法例修訂以訂明原則性事宜，並在下階段透過附屬法例或牌證條件處理其他技術細節，以期盡快落實網約車服務的規管，回應市民的訴求。」

發言人續說：「感謝立法會議員支持政府全速推進有關規管網約車服務的立法工作，我們會積極配合立法會的審議工作，並爭取在本屆立法會任期完結前通過《條例草案》。」

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據世界衞生組織的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。今年全球多國爆發基孔肯雅熱，截至今年七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗個案，當中約90宗為死亡個案。夏季溫度及雨量處於高水平，令多種蚊傳疾病在香港，以至全球爆發的風險持續，市民不能掉以輕心，無論在本地或是外遊期間都必須時刻採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施。若出現相關病徵，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後，應立即求醫，並通知醫生相關旅遊史。」

本港今年累計錄得13宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

食環署繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

衞生署早前根據情報，突擊搜查位於佐敦嘉賓大廈註冊中醫莊世華的處所，並檢獲一批藥膏。政府化驗所的檢驗結果顯示，一款沒有標籤的黃色藥膏樣本含有未標示西藥「醋酸地塞米松」、「咪康唑」及「撲熱息痛」成分。因應化驗結果，衞生署今日通知警方，並拘捕該名涉嫌非法管有第1部毒藥及未經註冊藥劑製品的註冊中醫。

「醋酸地塞米松」屬皮質類固醇，為第1部毒藥及處方藥物，用於治療炎症，不適當使用皮質類固醇可引致嚴重副作用，例如庫欣氏症候群，即出現圓臉及肌肉萎縮等病徵。「咪康唑」亦為第1部毒藥，常用於治療皮膚受真菌感染的藥物，外用可引致皮膚痕癢、刺激性及過敏反應等副作用。「撲熱息痛」普遍用作退燒及鎮痛，使用過量可引致肝臟及腎臟受損。

衞生署會繼續調查事件，並已要求涉事中醫通知曾獲處方上述藥膏的病人停止使用該藥膏。

根據《藥劑業及毒藥條例》（第138章），非法管有第1部毒藥及未經註冊藥劑製品均屬刑事罪行，一經定罪，每項罪行最高罰則為罰款100,000元及監禁兩年。待調查工作完成後，衞生署會就檢控事宜徵詢律政司的意見。署方亦會將個案轉介香港中醫藥管理委員會，以考慮是否需要採取紀律行動。

曾獲上述中醫處方藥膏的市民，如有不適或懷疑，應盡快徵詢醫護人員的意見。市民可在辦公時間內，將有關藥物送交九龍觀塘巧明街100號Landmark East友邦九龍大樓16樓衞生署中醫藥規管辦公室銷毀。"
Registered Chinese medicine practitioner arrested for allegedly prescribing cream product containing undeclared Western drug ingredients (with photo),2025-09-04 17:45,2025-09-04 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400603.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) today (September 4) said that a registered Chinese medicine practitioner (CMP) practising in Jordan was arrested for allegedly prescribing a cream product (see photo) containing undeclared Western drug ingredients to patients. Members of the public should stop using the cream if they have been prescribed the product concerned.

  Acting upon intelligence, the DH raided the premises of registered CMP Chong Sai-wa Andy at Champion Building in Jordan and seized a batch of the cream product for analysis. Test result from the Government Laboratory confirmed that an unlabelled yellow cream sample contained undeclared Western drug ingredients, namely dexamethasone acetate, miconazole and paracetamol. In light of the test result, the DH notified the Police today, and the registered CMP was arrested on suspicion of illegally possessing Part 1 poisons and unregistered pharmaceutical products.

  Dexamethasone acetate, a corticosteroid, is a Part 1 poison and prescription medicine for treating inflammation. Inappropriate use of corticosteroids may cause serious side effects such as Cushing's syndrome, with symptoms including moon face and muscle atrophy. Miconazole, also a Part 1 poison, is an antifungal medicine commonly used for the treatment of fungal infections of the skin. It can cause side effects such as itching, irritation and an allergic reaction when used topically. Paracetamol is commonly used for its anti-pyretic and analgesic effects, but an overdose may cause liver and kidney damage.

  The DH will continue to investigate the case and has requested the CMP concerned to contact his patients who have been prescribed the above cream product to stop using it.

  According to the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138), illegal possession of Part 1 poisons and unregistered pharmaceutical products are criminal offences. The maximum penalty for each offenceupon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment. Upon completion of the investigations, the DH will consult the Department of Justice on prosecution matters. The DH will refer the case to the Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong for consideration of possible disciplinary action.

  Members of the public who have been prescribed the cream product by the above CMP who feel unwell or are in doubt should consult healthcare professionals as soon as possible. They may submit the medicines concerned to the DH's Chinese Medicine Regulatory Office at 16/F, AIA Kowloon Tower, Landmark East, 100 How Ming Street, Kwun Tong, Kowloon, during office hours for disposal."

八月份第12批涵蓋八個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年八月共12批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共64個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年七月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這64個監察區中，45個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有14區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

FEHD releases 12th batch of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August,2025-09-04 17:00,2025-09-04 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400326.htm,"ããThe Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (September 4) released the 12th batch of gravidtrap indexes and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in August, covering eight survey areas, as follows:

Among the 12th batch of Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering eight survey areas in August, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released 12 batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August 2025, covering 64 survey areas. Among these 64 survey areas, 45 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. July 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Fourteen other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

Voters to follow voting procedures in 2025 Election Committee Subsector By-elections to be held this Sunday,2025-09-04 16:00,2025-09-04 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400495.htm,"The 2025 Election Committee Subsector (ECSS) By-elections will be held this Sunday (September 7) and the polling hours are from 9am to 6pm. The Registration and Electoral Office (REO) reminds voters/authorised representatives (ARs) concerned to follow the instructions on their poll card and bring the original of their valid Hong Kong identity (HKID) card to vote at their designated polling station.

 A spokesman for the REO said today (September 4), ""In accordance with the law, only registered voters/ARs in the 2025 final register of voters for Election Committee subsectors who belong to contested subsectors are eligible to vote on the polling day. The six contested subsectors are commercial (third); architectural, surveying, planning and landscape; technology and innovation; labour; representatives of members of Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees, and District Fire Safety Committees of Hong Kong and Kowloon; and representatives of members of Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees, and District Fire Safety Committees of the New Territories.

""Voters/ARs of the six subsectors may use 'iAM Smart' or the voter registration website (vr.gov.hk) to log in to the Online Voter Information Enquiry System to check polling information such as the name and address of their designated polling station and its location on the map, the polling hours, as well as the Introduction to Candidates. They can also call the election hotline (2891 1001) for enquiries.""

 On the polling day, there will be 28 candidates contesting a total of 21 seats in six subsectors. Five ordinary polling stations located in the Exhibition Gallery of Hong Kong Central Library, Kowloon Park Sports Centre, Wai Tsuen Sports Centre, Tiu Keng Leng Sports Centre and Che Kung Temple Sports Centre, and one dedicated polling station at Happy Valley Police Station will be set up for about 3 600 voters/ARs of the contested subsectors.

Polling arrangements

  A voter or an AR must produce the original of his/her valid HKID card at the ballot paper issuing desk in the polling station. The polling staff will scan the HKID card of the voter or AR using a tablet of the Electronic Poll Register System to verify his/her identity and issue the ballot paper(s) upon verification.

 When marking the ballot paper, voters/ARs must fill in the ovals opposite the names of the candidates of their choice with the black pen provided at the polling station, and vote for no more than the prescribed number of seats in the relevant subsector, otherwise the ballot paper will be regarded as invalid.

 The spokesman said, ""Ballot paper checking machines will be set up at the polling stations for voters/ARs to check whether the ballot paper has been marked according to the electoral law. The ballot paper checking machines will not record or count the choice(s) marked on the ballot paper. Having checked the ballot paper, voters/ARs should insert the unfolded ballot paper into the ballot box with the marked side facing down. It is in principle alright for voters/ARs to bring along a piece of paper listing the names or numbers of the candidates of their choice for easy reference when marking the ballot papers. Nevertheless, voters/ARs should bear in mind that they should not show the paper to other people inside the polling station and they should take the paper with them when leaving the polling station. Otherwise, the voters/ARs concerned may violate the electoral law,"" the spokesman said.

 Based on the principles of the autonomy of voting and secrecy of votes, it is prohibited under the law to have anyone (even for the voter/AR's relative or friend) to accompany or assist the voter to cast his/her vote. If necessary, a voter/an AR may ask the Presiding Officer or his/her deputy to mark the ballot paper on the voter/AR's behalf in the presence of a member of the polling staff as witness. It is an offence for any voter/AR to disturb others, use electronic devices for communication, take photographs, or make a video or audio recording at a polling station.

 The spokesman said that the introduction booklets on candidates printed by the REO will be displayed at all polling stations for reference by voters/ARs.

Special arrangements at polling stations

 Two queues will be set up at the polling stations. One queue is for people aged 70 or above, pregnant women and those who are not able to queue for a long time or have difficulty in queuing due to their physical condition, while the other queue is for other voters/ARs. The Presiding Officers will flexibly deploy ballot paper issuing desks depending on the queuing situation.

 A certain area outside each polling station will be designated as a no canvassing zone to ensure that voters/ARs can gain access to the polling stations without interference. A no staying zone will also be designated outside the entrance and exit of a polling station. No one is allowed to stay in the no staying zone or be allowed to canvass for votes or conduct ""de-facto canvassing"" such as making hand gestures and greetings in the no canvassing zone.

 Enquiries about the By-elections on the polling day can be made to the election hotline at 2891 1001, which will operate from 8.30am to 6.30pm that day. A complaints hotline (2827 7251/3707 0188) will be in service from 9am to 6.30pm that day to handle complaints about breaches of electoral rules or guidelines.

Counting arrangements

 Once the poll is closed, the ballot boxes will be delivered to the Central Counting Station at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre for counting. Candidates, election agents and counting agents may enter the Central Counting Station and observe the count at designated areas of the counting zone. Members of the public and media may also enter the public area of the Central Counting Station to observe the count. A notice setting out the maximum capacity of members of the public in the public area will be displayed outside the Central Counting Station.

 Once the counting of votes is completed, the Returning Officers will declare the election results at the Central Counting Station. The REO will also arrange for the Returning Officers to announce again the election results of each subsector on the stage of the Media Centre. The election results will also be displayed outside the Central Counting Station and published via press releases and the election website (www.elections.gov.hk).

 For enquiries, please call the election hotline on 2891 1001 or visit the election website for more information on the By-elections."

  盧寵茂教授早上與國家中醫藥管理局局長余艷紅教授會面時，向她介紹香港中醫藥發展的最新情況，以及將於今年底公布的《中醫藥發展藍圖》的制訂工作。他說︰「香港特別行政區（特區）政府十分重視中醫藥全方位、高質量及高水平發展，近年持續加大力度並投放更多資源，積極推展和落實各項工作。香港中醫醫院和政府中藥檢測中心永久大樓兩個中醫藥發展旗艦機構於今年十二月起分階段投入服務後，將有助香港在中醫藥臨床服務、人才培訓和檢測標準等領域進一步發展。」

  他又提及特區政府將於十二月承辦「第七屆粵港澳大灣區中醫藥傳承創新發展大會」，屆時來自大灣區三地九市代表及國內外中醫藥權威專家學者將匯聚香港作交流，並共同見證多項香港中醫藥發展的重要里程碑。

  隨後，盧寵茂教授與衞健委副主任曹雪濤院士會面，提到近年香港公立醫院積極採納各項國家醫療標準進行認證。盧寵茂教授說︰「特區醫療機構採納國家醫療標準進行認證，除了能提升自身的醫療專業水平與服務質量外，亦有助與國家醫療衞生服務體系接軌，並且充分發揮香港背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，向國際社會展示國家醫療標準的卓越性，助力國家醫療標準走向國際。」

  繼東區尤德夫人那打素醫院和威爾斯親王醫院兩家公立醫院成功通過《國際醫院評審認證標準（中國）》（2021版）評審認證，特區政府正推動醫院管理局（醫管局）轄下更多公立醫院採納該標準進行認證。此外，醫管局亦根據行政長官《施政報告》提出的相關政策，按國家認證標準於合適的公立醫院建設胸痛中心和中風中心。其中，瑪麗醫院的胸痛中心已於今年五月成功通過相關評審，成為香港首間獲國家認證的胸痛中心。」

  會上，盧寵茂教授亦談及與內地在癌症領域的合作。他說︰「國家癌症中心在癌症防治領域擁有豐富經驗，雙方會繼續秉持『資源聯動、技術同質、人才共用、合作共赢』的理念，並堅持『優勢互補、互利共贏』的原則，深化和拓展戰略協作，不斷提升癌症防治的專業水準，增進人民健康福祉。」

  下午，盧寵茂教授與藥監局局長李利會面時，向他介紹香港發展成為國際醫療創新樞紐的多項重要措施。盧寵茂教授表示︰「特區政府正積極籌備於明年成立香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心（藥械監管中心），並於明年分階段落實『第一層審批』新藥註冊機制。藥械監管中心的成立將大力推動香港的醫療創新，並助力國內創新藥械走向國際，惠及香港及其他地區的人民。」

  「同時，香港特區政府積極響應國家戰略與政策指引，成立粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所，並正籌建真實世界研究及應用中心。特區政府期望透過粵港澳大灣區城市合作，共同將大灣區打造成為國家乃至全球領先的醫療創新高地，大力發展新質生產力，推動臨床試驗及生物醫藥產業發展，以香港所長，貢獻國家所需。」

  During the meeting with the Commissioner of the NATCM, Professor Yu Yanhong, this morning, Professor Lo introduced her to the latest Chinese medicine (CM) developments in Hong Kong and the formulation of the Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint, which will be released at the end of this year. He said, ""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government attaches great importance to the high-quality and high-standard development of CM on all fronts, and has continued to step up its efforts and devote more resources in recent years to pursue and implement various initiatives. The two flagship institutions for CM development, namely The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong and the permanent premises of the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute, with services to be commenced in phases from December this year, will be conducive to Hong Kong's further development in areas such as CM clinical services, talent training, and testing standards.""

  He also mentioned that the HKSAR Government will host the 7th Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) Conference on Inheritance, Innovation and Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine in December. Representatives from the two special administrative regions and nine municipalities of the Guangdong Province of the GBA, as well as authoritative Mainland and overseas CM experts and scholars, will gather in Hong Kong for exchanges and to jointly witness various significant milestones in CM development in Hong Kong.

  Professor Lo then met with Vice-Minister of the NHC Professor Cao Xuetao, and mentioned that public hospitals in Hong Kong have been adopting various national healthcare standards for accreditation in recent years. Professor Lo said, ""By adopting national healthcare standards for accreditation, healthcare institutions in the HKSAR not only can enhance their healthcare professional standards and service quality but also facilitate their alignment with the national healthcare service system. This can also demonstrate the excellence of the national healthcare standards to the international community through fully leveraging Hong Kong's distinctive advantages of having strong support from the motherland and close connection with the world, thereby facilitating the national standards to go global.""

  Following the successful accreditation of two public hospitals, namely Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital, under China's International Hospital Accreditation Standards (2021 Version), the HKSAR Government is promoting the adoption of the Standards for accreditation in more public hospitals under the Hospital Authority (HA). Furthermore, in line with the relevant policy initiatives set out in the Chief Executive's Policy Address, the HA is establishing chest pain centres and stroke centres in accordance with national accreditation standards at suitable public hospitals. Of these, the chest pain centre at Queen Mary Hospital was successfully accredited in May this year, becoming the first nationally accredited chest pain centre in Hong Kong.

  During the meeting, Professor Lo also touched upon co-operation with the Mainland in the field of cancer. He said, ""The National Cancer Center has extensive experience in cancer prevention and treatment. Both sides will continue to strive for the goals of 'equally high-calibre technology with the available resources, pooling our talent to strike win-win co-operation', and uphold the principle of 'complementarity and mutual benefits', while deepening and expanding the strategic collaboration to continuously improve the professional standard in cancer prevention and treatment, thereby improving the health and well-being of the people.""

  In the afternoon, Professor Lo met with the Commissioner of the NMPA, Mr Li Li, to introduce various key initiatives for developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub. Professor Lo said, ""The HKSAR Government is actively preparing for the establishment of the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation (CMPR) next year, and will implement the 'primary evaluation' for new drugs registration in phases starting next year. The establishment of the CMPR will considerably enhance Hong Kong's health and medical innovation, and facilitate the Mainland's innovative drugs and medical devices to go global, benefitting the people of Hong Kong and other regions.

  ""At the same time, the HKSAR Government has established the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute and is preparing to establish the Real-World Study and Application Centre in response to the national strategies and policy guidance. The HKSAR Government aspires to collaborate with the GBA cities to jointly establish the GBA as a leading hub for health and medical innovation at both national and global levels, while sparing no effort in developing new quality productive forces, and promoting the development of clinical trials and the biomedical industry, thereby serving the country's needs with Hong Kong's own strengths.""

  Members of the delegation include the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam; Deputy Secretary for Health Mr Eddie Lee; and the Chief Executive of the HA, Dr Libby Lee. Professor Lo will return to Hong Kong tonight. During his absence, the Under Secretary for Health, Dr Cecilia Fan, is the Acting Secretary for Health."
