Transport Department issues pilot licence for autonomous vehicles to approve trial in Southern District,2025-08-14 17:35,2025-08-14 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400789.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) announced today (August 14) that a pilot licence for autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been issued in accordance with section 4(1) of the Road Traffic (Autonomous Vehicles) Regulation (Cap. 374AA) to approve routes for AV trial in Southern District.

  The applicant has been approved to conduct trials for 10 AVs in Cyberport. In the first phase, two autonomous private cars will operate in each road test at a specified time on specified road sections within the Cyberport campus, including Information Crescent and Cyberport Road (near The Arcade of Cyberport), passing by Cyberport 1, Cyberport 2 and Cyberport 3.

A spokesman for the TD said that the applicant commenced AV road tests in North Lantau from December 2024 and conducted small-scale passenger-carrying trials on Airport Island from end-April 2025. The scale of road tests without passengers has also been expanded from a single route to more open roads with more complex traffic scenarios. The project has largely been smooth to date, and the performance of AVs has remained stable. The TD also approved the applicant in mid-June to conduct road tests in Tung Chung. This additional pilot licence provides parallel trials running in different small communities so that useful trial data can be collected.

  The TD's label for AV shall be displayed on all AVs for identification by other road users. Details of the pilot licence have been uploaded to the TD's website on AV trials.

  The TD welcomes interested organisations or enterprises to submit applications for a pilot licence and act in concert to promote the further development of autonomous driving in Hong Kong. Upon receipt of an application, the TD will consider various factors, including the design operating range and functions of the autonomous system, relevant international or national standards/guidelines, and the road test situations, based on the Code of Practice for Trial and Pilot Use of Autonomous Vehicles before approval. The TD will exercise stringent control with a view to promoting AV trials and development in Hong Kong in a safe and orderly manner."

  During the visit to Amgen Biotechnology Singapore this morning, the delegation introduced various key measures for Hong Kong's development as an international health and medical innovation hub, including expediting the reform of the approval mechanism for drugs and medical devices, enhancing Hong Kong's clinical trial capability on all fronts and facilitating the translation of innovative biomedical research results into clinical applications. Professor Lo emphasised, ""Hong Kong will continue to leverage its international advantages to actively promote the research and development (R&D) and application of biomedical technologies. Through the establishment of the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation and the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute, we will further improve the mechanisms for new drug R&D and approval, attracting global top-notch innovative enterprises and R&D organisations to set up operations in Hong Kong. These measures will not only accelerate patient access to advanced treatments but also solidify Hong Kong's position as an international health and medical innovation hub.""

  Professor Lo encouraged overseas pharmaceutical companies to make good use of the ""1+"" mechanism for the approval of new drugs, and ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration, which will be rolled out in phases starting next year, to introduce newly developed drugs into Hong Kong to meet local healthcare needs. He also welcomed overseas pharmaceutical companies to conduct clinical trials in Hong Kong, fully leveraging the multiple unique advantages of Hong Kong to facilitate the translation and clinical application of advanced biomedical technologies.

  The delegation also visited the National Cancer Centre Singapore this morning and introduced the work of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government in cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment. Professor Lo said, ""Hong Kong has established the Cancer Coordinating Committee to formulate strategies on cancer prevention and control as early as 2001, and launched the Hong Kong Cancer Strategy in 2019, with a view to reducing the cancer burden on Hong Kong through setting work priorities and directions. Addressing cancer encompasses education, prevention and screening, surveillance, research, treatment, etc. For instance, on prevention and screening, the Government has rolled out the Cervical Screening Programme, the Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme and the Breast Cancer Screening Pilot Programme (BCSPP) based on recommendations from experts. The Government is formulating risk-based screening programmes for prevalent cancers on a gradual basis, including the BCSPP Phase II that has been rolled out and the hepatitis B screening programme to be launched by the Primary Healthcare Commission to reduce the risk of complications, such as liver cancer, of people infected with hepatitis B virus. The Government is also exploring the feasibility of using artificial intelligence to assist lung cancer screening to further enhance cancer prevention.""

  In the afternoon, Professor Lo visited the National Healthcare Group Sembawang Polyclinic for an in-depth exchange on primary healthcare services in Hong Kong and Singapore with the senior personnel of the polyclinic. He said, ""Hong Kong is actively taking forward a major reform of its primary healthcare system to address the challenges posed by an ageing population and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases. Based on the principle of 'prevention-focused and community-based', the HKSAR Government aims to build a sustainable healthcare system and fully enhance the health outcomes of citizens through systematic early intervention and co-ordinated care. In particular, we are promoting the 'Family Doctor for All' concept, strengthening the District Health Centre network across Hong Kong, and implementing the Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme that subsidises eligible citizens to undergo screening for diabetes mellitus, hypertension and blood lipid and follow-up treatment, to achieve the objectives of 'early prevention, early identification and early treatment'. I look forward to jointly exploring best practices in primary healthcare with the health authorities of Singapore, with a view to promoting sustainable healthcare development in the Asia-Pacific region.""

  Members of the delegation include the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, Deputy Secretary for Health Ms Elaine Mak, and a representative from the Hospital Authority. They concluded the visit today and will return to Hong Kong this evening."

八月份第三批涵蓋兩個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及八個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，除了馬鞍山，其他皆在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年八月共三批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共25個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年七月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這25個監察地區中，有15個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有八區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。至於指數高於10%的沙田馬鞍山及屯門掃管笏，按因應基孔肯雅熱情況而實施的安排（即將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域），食環署正聯同有關部門及持份者攜手找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。食環署亦會舉辦宣傳展覽、派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。此外，食環署會加強監察該兩個地區的誘蚊器指數，以檢視滅蚊工作成效。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：


收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Among the third batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering two survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering eight survey areas in August, all were below 10 per cent, except Ma On Shan.

The FEHD has so far announced three batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August, covering 25 survey areas. Among these 25 survey areas, 15 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared with the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. July 2025, representing the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained at a low level. Eight other areas recorded a slight increase but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent. As for So Kwun Wat in Tuen Mun and Ma On Shan in Sha Tin, each with an index higher than 10 per cent, in accordance with the mechanism implemented by the FEHD in response to the recent chikungunya fever (CF) situation that strengthens mosquito control work in areas with the gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, which was originally activated when the gravidtrap index reaches 20 per cent or above, the department is collaborating with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with high mosquito infestation and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. Additionally, the FEHD will also organise exhibitions, distribute leaflets and posters, and notify the residential estates subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures. In addition, the FEHD will strengthen the monitoring of the gravidtrap indexes in these two areas to review the effectiveness of the mosquito control work.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue joining hands in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:


tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racksto prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every sevendays;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest Gravidtrap Index and the Density Index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of CF transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools, to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由八月十三日中午截至今日（八月十四日）中午，食安中心已對122個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

香港天文台亦已加強監測本港水域的環境輻射水平。至目前為止，並沒有發現異常情況。詳情可參閱香港天文台的網頁（www.hko.gov.hk/tc/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html）。

由二○二三年八月二十四日起至今日中午，食安中心及漁護署分別檢測了共158 163個日本進口食物樣本（包括103 676個水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽樣本）及共35 848個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。"
Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-08-14 17:00,2025-08-14 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400765.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on August 13 to noon today (August 14), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 122 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 158 163 samples of food imported from Japan (including 103 676 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 35 848 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."
SWD and ICAC announce investigation into suspected fraudulent act seeking to obtain subsidies from Community Care Service Voucher Scheme for the Elderly,2025-08-14 16:45,2025-08-14 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400688.htm,"The Social Welfare Department (SWD) today (August 14) announced that it was collaborating with the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in an investigation into a suspected fraudulent act by recognised service providers (RSPs) of the Community Care Service Voucher Scheme for the Elderly (CCSV)seeking to obtain Government subsidies. Five persons have been arrested so far.

  Launched as a pilot programme in September 2013 and regularised in 2023, the Scheme provides needy elderly persons with more options in community care services so that they can enjoy their lives in familiar environments. Adopting the ""money-following-the-user"" concept, the Scheme not only allows elderly users to purchase suitable community care services from RSPs for meeting their needs, but also allows them to switch RSPs in a flexible manner. The services include nursing care, rehabilitation services, carer training, home safety assessments and home modification recommendations, meal delivery and escort services, etc.

  The SWD received a report last year that an RSP was suspected of making use of the Scheme to deceive Government subsidies by submitting false service records to the SWD and encouraging families or carers of the elderly persons to make fraudulent claims on their service uses. While making an immediate referral to the ICAC, the SWD also provided the ICAC with relevant information to assist their investigation.

The five arrested persons come from two different service providers. The SWD has strengthened the auditing of their service records and documents. Elderly users and their families were also contacted to ensure that the elders have obtained the services they need.

The SWD stressed that it will continue to perform its monitoring role and take follow-up actions on all suspected cases seriously. Unannounced service-monitoring visits, sampling checks as well as reviews on records and documents are conducted to ensure that RSPs have been providing services to the voucher holders according to the SWD's service requirements.

  The SWD will require RSPs to make improvements on their services or sanctions will be imposed on them if there are any irregularities. Should any RSPs fail to provide services or make improvements in accordance with the relevant requirements, the SWD will consider suspension or termination of the service agreements with the RSPs.

  The SWD reaffirms its zero tolerance for any unlawful act. Referrals will be made to the enforcement agencies for investigations to safeguard the proper use of public funds and the well-being of elderly people.

  The SWD will continue to strictly monitor the service quality of RSPs and review the relevant procedures with reference to the corruption prevention advice provided by the ICAC. Subject to the investigation results of the ICAC, the SWD may terminate the service agreements with the service providers concerned. If there are any subsidies released to non-entitled bodies, the SWD will take appropriate actions to recover the overpayments."
社署與廉政公署公布一宗懷疑詐騙長者社區照顧服務券計劃津貼個案的調查,2025-08-14 16:45,2025-08-14 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400684.htm,"社會福利署（社署）今日（八月十四日）公布，正配合廉政公署調查一宗長者社區照顧服務券（社區券）計劃認可服務單位懷疑詐騙政府津貼的個案。至今，共有五人涉案被捕。

社區券計劃於二○一三年九月以試驗形式推行，並在二○二三年成為恆常措施，目的是為有需要的長者提供更多社區照顧服務的選擇，讓他們在自己熟悉的環境安享晚年。計劃以「錢跟人走」的概念，讓長者直接向認可服務單位，選擇所需的社區照顧服務，並可以靈活轉換服務單位。服務內容包括護理服務、康復服務、照顧者培訓、家居環境安全評估和改善建議、膳食服務及護送服務等。

社署於去年接獲舉報，指懷疑有認可服務單位透過社區券計劃詐騙政府津貼，包括向社署提供失實的服務記錄文件、教唆長者的家人╱照顧者訛稱已接受服務。社署隨即將個案轉介廉政公署跟進，同時向廉政公署提供相關資料和配合其調查工作。

五名被捕人士分別來自兩個服務單位。社署已加強審核其服務記錄及檔案，並聯絡使用有關單位服務的長者及其家人，確保長者得到所需服務。

社署強調，會繼續恪守監管角色，嚴肅跟進所有可疑個案，並透過突擊覆核探訪、抽樣檢查，以及審核記錄和檔案，確保認可服務單位按照社署訂明的服務要求，向社區券持有人提供服務。

如有違規情況，社署會向認可服務單位提出改善建議或作出懲處；如發現認可服務單位未有按相關要求提供服務及作出糾正，社署甚至會考慮暫停或終止與該認可服務單位簽訂的服務協議。

社署重申，絕不會容忍或姑息任何非法行為，定必將個案轉交執法機關跟進調查，確保公帑用得其所，並保障長者的利益。

社署會繼續嚴格監察認可服務單位的服務質素，並參考廉政公署提供的防貪建議，檢視社區券計劃的相關程序。社署會視乎廉政公署的調查結果，考慮終止違法單位的社區券計劃服務協議。如涉及有人多領款項，社署必定悉數追討。"
二零二五年年中人口數字,2025-08-14 16:30,2025-08-14 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400405.htm,"根據政府統計處今日（八月十四日）發表的數字顯示，二零二五年年中香港人口的臨時數字為7 527 500人，與二零二四年年中的數字比較大致維持不變。

二零二四年年中至二零二五年年中期間錄得18 200名香港居民淨移入（即移入多於移出）。在同期內，人口錄得14 800人的自然減少（即死亡多於出生），出生人數為35 200人，死亡人數為50 000人。

二零二五年年中的總人口中，常住居民佔7 247 600人，而流動居民佔 279 900人。二零二四年年底人口修訂數字為7 500 600人。常住居民的數字修訂為7 219 900人，流動居民的數字則修訂為280 700人。二零二三年年底至二零二四年年底的人口變動率亦修訂為-0.4%。

表一列出二零二五年年中的總人口，而表二則列出二零一四年年中至二零二五年年中的人口數字。

評論

政府發言人指出，香港繼續受惠於各項吸引人才和輸入勞工措施。過去幾年，有不少人士從內地及世界各地移入香港，抵銷人口自然減少的影響，使二零二五年年中整體人口保持穩定，並較二零二二年年中人口增加超過18萬人。

進一步資料

「常住居民」指兩類人士：（一）在統計時點之前的六個月內，在港逗留最少三個月，又或在統計時點之後的六個月內，在港逗留最少三個月的香港永久性居民，不論在統計時點他們是否身在香港；及（二）在統計時點身在香港的香港非永久性居民。

對於不是「常住居民」的香港永久性居民，如他們在統計時點之前的六個月內，在港逗留最少一個月但少於三個月，又或在統計時點之後的六個月內，在港逗留最少一個月但少於三個月，不論在統計時點他們是否身在香港，會被界定為「流動居民」。

根據慣例，每次發表最新的人口數字為「臨時數字」。而經修訂的數字會在其後的六個月公布。即是說，二零二五年年中人口的臨時數字於今天公布，而修訂數字將於二零二六年二月公布。"

Volume and price statistics of external merchandise trade in June 2025,2025-08-14 16:30,2025-08-14 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400449.htm,"  Further to the external merchandise trade statistics in value terms for June 2025 released earlier on, the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (August 14) the volume and price statistics of external merchandise trade for that month.

  In June 2025, the volume of Hong Kong's total exports of goods and imports of goods increased by 10.3% and 9.2% respectively over June 2024.

  Comparing the first half of 2025 with the same period in 2024, the volume of Hong Kong's total exports of goods and imports of goods increased by 10.4% and 10.2% respectively.

  Comparing the second quarter of 2025 with the preceding quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, the volume of total exports of goods and imports of goods increased by 3.4% and 4.4% respectively.

  Changes in volume of external merchandise trade are derived from changes in external merchandise trade value with the effect of price changes discounted.

  Comparing June 2025 with June 2024, the prices of total exports of goods and imports of goods increased by 1.6% and 1.8% respectively.

  As regards price changes in the first half of 2025 over the same period in 2024, the prices of total exports of goods and imports of goods both increased by 1.9%.

  Price changes in external merchandise trade are reflected by changes in unit value indices of external merchandise trade, which are compiled based on average unit values or, for certain commodities, specific price data.

  The terms of trade index is derived from the ratio of price index of total exports of goods to that of imports of goods. Compared with the same periods in 2024, the index decreased by 0.2% in June 2025 and 0.1% in the first half of 2025.

  Changes in the unit value and volume of total exports of goods by main destination are shown in Table 1.

  Comparing June 2025 with June 2024, increases were recorded for the total export volume to Vietnam (34.7%), the mainland of China (the Mainland) (17.2%), India (12.6%) and Taiwan (2.6%). On the other hand, the total export volume to the USA decreased by 12.3%.

  Over the same period of comparison, the total export prices to Taiwan (4.8%), Vietnam (2.2%), the Mainland (1.2%) and the USA (0.8%) increased. On the other hand, the total export prices to India decreased by 1.5%.

  Changes in the unit value and volume of imports of goods by main supplier are shown in Table 2.

  Comparing June 2025 with June 2024, increases were recorded for the import volume from Vietnam (45.6%), the Mainland (16.5%), Singapore (5.9%) and Taiwan (3.8%). On the other hand, the import volume from Korea decreased by 29.6%.

  Over the same period of comparison, the import prices from all main suppliers increased: Korea (3.2%), Taiwan (3.1%), Vietnam (2.8%), Singapore (1.9%) and the Mainland (1.0%).

Mid-year population for 2025,2025-08-14 16:30,2025-08-14 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400404.htm,"  According to the statistics released by the Census and Statistics Department today (August 14), the provisional estimate of the Hong Kong population was 7 527 500 at mid-2025. The population remained virtually unchanged, as compared with that at mid-2024.

 A net inflow of 18 200 Hong Kong residents (i.e. inflow more than outflow) was recorded during the period from mid-2024 to mid-2025. Over the same period, a natural decrease (i.e. deaths surpassing births) of 14 800 was recorded, with 35 200 births and 50 000 deaths.

 Among the total population at mid-2025, 7 247 600 were Usual Residents and 279 900 were Mobile Residents. The revised figure for the year-end population for 2024 was 7 500 600. The number of Usual Residents was revised to 7 219 900 and the number of Mobile Residents to 280 700. The rate of change in population from end-2023 to end-2024 was also revised to -0.4%.

 Table 1 presents estimated total population as at mid-2025, while Table 2 presents population figures from mid-2014 to mid-2025.

Commentary

 A Government spokesperson pointed out that Hong Kong continues to benefit from various measures on talent attraction and labour importation. Over the past few years, many people have moved to Hong Kong from the Mainland and other places around the world. This has offset the impact of natural population decrease, stabilising the overall population in mid-2025, which increased by over 0.18 million compared to mid-2022.

Further information

 ""Usual Residents"" refer to two categories of people: (1) Hong Kong Permanent Residents who have stayed in Hong Kong for at least three months during the six months before or for at least three months during the six months after the reference time-point, regardless of whether they are in Hong Kong or not at the reference time-point; and (2) Hong Kong Non-permanent Residents who are in Hong Kong at the reference time-point.

 For those Hong Kong Permanent Residents who are not ""Usual Residents"", they are classified as ""Mobile Residents"" if they have stayed in Hong Kong for at least one month but less than three months during the six months before or for at least one month but less than three months during the six months after the reference time-point, regardless of whether they are in Hong Kong or not at the reference time-point.

 Under the current practice, the latest population estimate is released on a provisional basis in each round. The revised estimate will be released six months later. In other words, while the provisional population estimate for mid-2025 is released today, the corresponding revised estimate will be released in February 2026."

These eight projects cover various policy areas that are in line with the future strategic positioning and development needs of Hong Kong, including attracting and retaining talent to pursue further studies and development in Hong Kong, with a view to promoting Hong Kong as an international education hub; facilitating effective collaboration between post-secondary institutions and the GuangdongâHong KongâMacao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to deepen the integrated development of industry, academia and research sectors; further promoting the development of vocational and professional education and training and universities of applied sciences to create diversified career pathways for students; and exploring the positioning of the Northern Metropolis University Town in the education and research domain to foster it as an engine for the development of various industries in the GBA.

The PPRFS aims to encourage local think tank experts and scholars (including universities and civil society think tanks) to apply their expertise to conduct evidence-based research on key public policy issues, facilitate the knowledge transfer of research findings to policy considerations, and serve as a channel for the Government to tap into the public policy research expertise of society. Applications are assessed by an Assessment Panel that comprises experienced academics and professional experts. Research quality and relevance of the proposal to the public policy needs are the principal criteria of assessment. The Assessment Panel will also take into account comments of external reviewers who are experienced academics and professional experts during the assessment process, as well as views of relevant government bureaux/departments. A declaration of interests system is in place to ensure that the assessments are fair and impartial.

During the meeting, the two delegations discussed the planning and development of land BCPs, including reporting progress and exchanging views on the redevelopment projects of BCPs in Huanggang and Sha Tau Kok, and the transfer of the food control function of the Man Kam To Boundary Control Point. Concluding the meeting, Mr Tang said he will continue to follow the development of BCPs to ensure smooth project implementation, while flexibly adjusting strategies to address challenges, realise the modernisation of control points and meet the needs of citizens.

勞工處發言人說：「在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告取消後，僱員如遇到實際困難而未能及時返回工作崗位，僱主應予以體諒並作出彈性處理，例如讓僱員分批復工、容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"
Employers and employees should make reasonable work arrangements after tropical cyclones or rainstorms,2025-08-14 11:12,2025-08-14 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400430.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (August 14) reminded employers to make practical and reasonable work arrangements for employees after the cancellation of tropical cyclone warnings or rainstorm warnings, with due consideration to the road and traffic conditions and other factors, and make flexible arrangements for staff to resume work or work remotely (if applicable). This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  In the first half of the recital, Lugansky will perform Beethoven's ""Piano Sonata No. 17 in D minor, Op. 31, No. 2, 'The Tempest'"" and Schumann's ""Faschingsschwank aus Wien, Op. 26"". The second half of the recital features three transcriptions of excerpts adapted from Wagner's operas, namely ""Entry of the Gods into Valhalla"" from Act II, Scene 4 of ""Das Rheingold""; ""Magic Fire Music"" from Act III, Scene 3 of ""Die Walküre""; and ""Transformation Music and Finale"" from Act I and III of ""Parsifal"". Lugansky will then conclude the recital with Liszt's ""St François de Paule: Marchant sur les flots"" (Deux Légendes, S. 175, No. 2).

  Described by British classical music magazine ""Gramophone"" as ""the most trailblazing and meteoric performer of all"", Lugansky collaborates regularly with conductors of the calibre of Kent Nagano, Yuri Temirkanov, Manfred Honeck, Gianandrea Noseda and Vasily Petrenko, among others. He has regularly been invited by leading international orchestras, including the Berliner Philharmoniker, London Symphony Orchestra and Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as participating in the world's most distinguished festivals such as the Aspen, Tanglewood and Verbier festivals. Lugansky has received numerous awards for his many acclaimed recordings, including Diapason d'Or, the Premio Abbiati del Disco for solo repertoire, ""Gramophone""'s ""Editor's Choice"" and has been included in ""The Best Classical Albums of the Year"".

衞生防護中心呼籲市民在惡劣天氣下提高警覺預防類鼻疽感染,2025-08-14 10:25,2025-08-14 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400368.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（八月十四日）呼籲市民在惡劣天氣下提高警覺，保持個人及環境衞生，預防感染類鼻疽，並特別提醒高風險群組，包括長者及長期病患者，在颱風或暴雨後應避免接觸土壤或泥水，減低感染風險。

類鼻疽是一種由類鼻疽伯克氏菌引致的疾病。類鼻疽伯克氏菌廣泛存在於土壤和泥水中，特別是濕潤的黏土。人類可能通過接觸受污染的土壤和水源（尤其是經皮膚損傷／傷口）、吸入受污染的微塵／水滴和飲用受污染的水而受到感染。長期病患者及免疫力弱人士有較大機會受感染。

根據海外文獻和本地數據，在颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令類鼻疽病菌更容易散播，令感染個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。

因應近期本港受颱風以及連日暴雨影響，中心再次提醒市民，特別是高風險群組例如長期病患者，盡量避免接觸土壤或泥水，以免受類鼻疽病菌感染。

類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得人類感染類鼻疽個案。截至昨日（八月十三日），本港今年錄得八宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。因應二○二二年深水埗出現的類鼻疽群組個案，中心及水務署已採取一系列的預防及監察措施，包括在全港所有配水庫的通風口加裝高效能空氣過濾網、加強食水的餘氯含量、持續監測配水庫及用戶水龍頭食水的餘氯含量，並加強健康教育和監測感染個案。至今包括於颱風及暴雨後所進行的監測結果未有出現異常情況，而食水水質監測的結果亦一直符合香港食水標準。

類鼻疽病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可以透過接觸患者的血液或體液而傳播。類鼻疽的病人可出現局部感染（例如皮膚膿腫）、肺炎、腦膜腦炎、敗血症或長期化膿性感染。視乎感染的部位，類鼻疽常見的病徵包括發燒、頭痛、局部痛楚或腫脹、潰瘍、胸痛、咳嗽、咳血及局部淋巴結腫大。中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。

中心再次提醒市民應採取以下措施預防感染：


避免接觸受污染的土壤；
進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿著適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴；
高風險人士如不能避免接觸受污染的水或土壤，應佩戴口罩和手套，並穿上水靴
接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

CHP appeals for heightened vigilance against melioidosis infection following adverse weather conditions,2025-08-14 10:25,2025-08-14 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400370.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 14) appealed to members of the public for heightened vigilance against melioidosis infection following adverse weather conditions and urged them to maintain personal and environmental hygiene. The CHP also specifically reminded high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water after typhoons or storms with a view to lowering infection risk.

  Melioidosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Burkholderia pseudomallei is widespread in soil and muddy water, particularly common in moist clay soil. Humans can become infected through contact with contaminated soil and surface water (especially through skin abrasions/wounds); inhalation of contaminated dust/water droplets; and ingestion of contaminated water. Those with underlying diseases or immunosuppression have higher risks of contracting the disease.

According to overseas literature and local data, Burkholderia pseudomallei in the soil and muddy water may be exposed to the ground after typhoons or storms, and the bacteria would spread more easily with strong wind and storms. As such, infection cases are more common after typhoons or storms.

In view of the recent disturbance caused by typhoon andconsecutive days of torrential rain, the CHP again reminded members of the public, in particular high-risk groups such as those with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water as far as practicable, to prevent melioidosis infection.

Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong and human infection cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year. As of yesterday (August 13), eight melioidosis infection cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded. In light of the cluster of melioidosis cases recorded in Sham Shui Po in 2022, the CHP and the Water Supplies Department have implemented a series of precautionary and monitoring measures, including the installation of high efficiency particulate air filters at the ventilators of all fresh water service reservoirs in Hong Kong, enhancing residual chlorine levels in drinking water, continual monitoring of residual chlorine level of fresh water in service reservoirs and consumers' taps, as well as health education and surveillance of infection cases. No abnormalities were detected from all surveillance results so far, including those conducted after typhoons and heavy rain, while the drinking water quality monitoring results have consistently been in compliance with the Hong Kong Drinking Water Standards.

Person-to-person transmission andanimal-to-human transmission are rare but may occur through contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. Melioidosis may present with localised infection (such as cutaneous abscess), pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, sepsis, or chronic suppurative infection. Depending on the site of infection, common symptoms of melioidosis include fever, headache, localised pain or swelling, ulceration, chest pain, cough, haemoptysis, and swelling of regional lymph nodes. The CHP appealed again to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromised conditions, in order to receive appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment.

The CHP reminded members of the public to take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. usinggloves and wearing boots;
If exposure to contaminated water or soil is inevitable, high-risk individuals should wear a mask, gloves and boots;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover any cuts or grazes with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soilor gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.

僱主僱員應訂立暴雨警告下的工作安排,2025-08-14 06:42,2025-08-14 07:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400198.htm,"勞工處今日（八月十四日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在暴雨警告下及極端情況及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以保障僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主應預先制定合理而可行的工作安排和應變措施。在擬訂及執行有關安排時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮當中的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在暴雨警告或極端情況下及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。」

如果紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外或空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如政府作出極端情況公布，除與僱主就此情況下已訂立返回工作地點上班協定的人員外，僱員應留在原來的地點或安全地點，不要啓程上班。已在工作地點當值的僱員，在安全情況下可如常工作；如工作地點有危險，在可行及安全的情況下，僱主應安排僱員提早下班或到安全的地方暫避。如工作時間在極端情況生效期間結束，僱主應在安全情況下安排僱員下班，或開放合適地方讓仍在工作地點的僱員暫避。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣及極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人亦提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"
Employers and employees should make work arrangements in times of rainstorm warnings,2025-08-14 06:42,2025-08-14 07:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400199.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (August 14) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions as early as possible, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of organisations, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

  ""Employers should make prior work arrangements and contingency measures for staff which are reasonably practicable. In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

  To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or extreme conditions come to an end, when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather or extreme conditions.

  ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.

  If a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.

  If the Government makes an extreme conditions announcement, apart from those required by employers to report for duty at workplaces, employees are advised to stay in the place they are currently in or in safe places when extreme conditions are in force, instead of heading for work. Employees who have already reported for duty at workplaces could continue to work as usual in a safe manner. If the workplaces are in danger, employers should release staff from work early under feasible conditions and in a safe manner or make available a safe place as temporary shelter for employees. If the working time ends while extreme conditions are still in force, employers can release employees from workplaces in a safe manner or provide a suitable area as temporary shelter for those still at workplaces.

  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.

  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.
 
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

勞工處發言人今日（八月十四日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

  A spokesman for the LD said today (August 14) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

Both the film and event showcased Hong Kong's vibrant sporting spirit, stunning natural landscapes and compelling cultural storytelling.

  In his opening remarks, the Director of the Singapore ETO, Mr Owin Fung, reiterated the commitment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government to supporting the development of the Hong Kong film industry and promoting its productions to international audiences through various funding schemes and talent development initiatives. The Singapore ETO strives to further enhance the global visibility of Hong Kong films and showcase the city's unique cultural creativity on the world stage through collaborations with overseas partners.

  Meanwhile, Mr Fung highlighted Hong Kong's potential in ecotourism. He thanked the film for bringing attention to Hong Kong's unique geological and ecological features, including areas within the Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark, and reaffirmed the city's commitment to sustainable tourism and sports development. He expressed his gratitude to the SFS and KMF for their ongoing support in bringing Hong Kong films to Singapore audiences.

  The event was well-received, attracting a full house of around 150 attendees. In the post-screening virtual Q&A session moderated by the Chairman of the SFS, Mr Kenneth Tan, audience members engaged with the film's director, Mr Robin Lee, sharing their reflections and asking thoughtful questions. Riding on the encouraging response, the Singapore ETO will continue to promote Hong Kong's rich and diverse narratives, and enhance international appreciation for its cultural and natural heritage.

  ""Four Trails"" chronicles the arduous Hong Kong Four Trails Ultra Challenge, a 298-kilometre ultramarathon across Hong Kong's iconic trails, celebrating both the resilience of runners and the city's volcanic geology and coastal scenery. The film garnered several accolades, including the Best New Director award at the 43rd Hong Kong Film Awards (2025).

FEHD continues to strengthen mosquito control and elimination efforts in Kwai Tsing District in view of imported chikungunya fever cases (with photos),2025-08-13 22:49,2025-08-13 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300966.htm,"A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (August 13) that in view of an imported case of chikungunya fever (CF) announced by the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) last night, the FEHD has immediately carried out anti-mosquito work at various locations in the vicinity of Ta Chuen Ping Street, Kwai Tsing District, where the patient resides. Such work include removing stagnant water, cleansing streets and applying larvicides to reduce the risk of disease transmission. The FEHD will also convene a meeting of the inter-departmental task force on anti-mosquito work in the district to coordinate departments and stakeholders in taking joint actions for mosquito prevention and control.

There have been industrial and recycling operations in the area near Ta Chuen Ping Street. Having found recyclers putting articles in public places during inspections, the FEHD officers hence instituted prosecution against the offenders and requested them to remove the articles immediately. As for the accumulation of articles in private areas nearby, the FEHD has warned the responsible persons that they must handle the articles properly to prevent mosquito breeding, or they will face prosecution.

In addition, the FEHD found water dripping from air-conditioners in residential units nearby during inspections, causing water accumulation in some of the back alleys. The FEHD has issued / will issue statutory notices to the owners or occupiers of the relevant premises, requiring them to rectify the situation within a specified period. At the same time, the FEHD has referred to the relevant department for follow-up actions on the uneven surfaces of back alleys to prevent from re-occurrence of water accumulation in the long run.

Moreover, in collaboration with Kwai Tsing District Council members, the FEHD distributed anti-mosquito promotional leaflets to shop owners and members of the public this morning to raise residents' awareness of mosquito prevention. The FEHD will also continue to conduct vector investigations within 250-metre radius of residence of the patient involved in the case announced last night. Immediate actions will be taken upon detection of mosquito breeding grounds, including removal of stagnant water and fogging operations to eradicate adult mosquitoes.

The imported cases recently announced also involve patients residing in Kwai Tsing District. The FEHD will continue to collaborate with relevant departments and stakeholders and conduct mosquito control and elimination work in the area near the patients' residence, to reduce the risk of disease transmission. The department will also step up publicity and education efforts with local community to raise public awareness of mosquito prevention.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue joining hands in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

· Tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
· Remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
· Check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks, to prevent stagnant water;
· Change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants no more than every 7 days;
· Properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquito from accessing the water; and
· Properly dispose articles that are able to contain water such as empty lunch boxes and cans.

Members of the public may refer to the FEHD's webpage on mosquito prevention and control (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/risk-pest-mosquito.html#), and should constantly pay attention to the information regarding CF released by the CHP of the DH. The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems."
TD provides convenience for direct issue of Hong Kong Full Driving Licence applications in multi-pronged approach,2025-08-13 22:40,2025-08-13 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300307.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) announced today (August 13) that new short, medium and long-term measures will be launched in phases towards the full implementation of online appointment services for application for direct issue of Hong Kong Full Driving Licence and quotas will be increased gradually, thereby improving efficiency and providing greater convenience to the public.

New arrangement on queue ticketing

  From today onwards, new queue ticketing requirements will be imposed on agents submitting ""direct issue"" applications at the Hong Kong Licensing Office at United Centre, Admiralty. When obtaining a ticket, all agents are required to input their identification document numbers and those of each of the respective applicants into the queue ticketing system. Such information will be printed on the ticket. Counter staff will verify the information of both the ticket holder and the applicant(s) entered during application processing. If any information does not match that printed on the ticket, all applications concerned will not be processed.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""The operation of the new arrangement today has largely been smooth. To ensure fair use of services by the public in need in an orderly manner, we will further enhance ""direct issue"" application procedures and provide more convenience for the public. We will expand our capacity and introduce new multi-pronged initiatives to promote digitalisation of licensing services.""

Towards full implementation of online appointment services

Short-term measure: Strengthening checks to improve online appointment arrangements

Starting from September, the TD will strengthen co-operation with relevant issuing authorities of driving licences, including more checks on ""direct issue"" applicants' information in relation to Mainland driving licences provided via online appointments. If any information is found to be untrue, the relevant appointments will be cancelled and such quotas will be reopened for appointment by other applicants, enhancing the effective operation of the system;


Medium-term measure: Full implementation of online appointment for counter services to replace on-site queue ticketing arrangements and enhancement of processing capacity

In the fourth quarter, the TD will accept online appointments for ""direct issue"" counter services only and no on-site queue ticketing will be arranged. By that time, the counter services for ""direct issue"" will be expanded to the other three Licensing Offices, namely the Kowloon Licensing Office at Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, the Kwun Tong Licensing Office at Kowloon East Government Offices and the Sha Tin Licensing Office at Sha Tin Government Offices, and the number of appointment quotas will be increased. Applicants must upload proof documents when making online appointments for verification of eligibility. If any information is found to be untrue, the relevant appointments will be cancelled; and


Long-term measure: Studying full implementation of online application as facilitation

The TD is actively studying the use of artificial intelligence technologies in ""direct issue"" application procedures. Applicants who uploaded proof documents during online appointments with initial approval only need to bring their original application documents for verification at Licensing Offices during their booked timeslots. A full driving licence can then be issued within the same day. This provides convenience for them to submit applications on their own, reducing the need to submit applications via agents.


  The spokesman stressed that the TD has been processing and verifying every ""direct issue"" application in a stringent manner. Applicants must submit sufficient, true and accurate documentary proof, and their applications will only be approved when they fully meet the eligibility criteria stipulated under the law.

  The TD has introduced various e-licensing services in the past year, including the enhanced vehicle licence providing convenience for vehicle owners who do not need to replace the paper licence after renewal; the development of e-Licensing Portal which is an one-stop online platform for managing licences; setting up International Driving Permit (IDP) Self-service Kiosks; and the launch of E-Auction enabling the public to bid for their desired vehicle registration marks. Following more and more online government services connected to the ""iAM Smart"", applications for most licences and driving test services can now be submitted online. At present, about 60 per cent of applicants for IDP applications and 50 per cent of full driving licence renewal applications are submitted online.

  The TD will continue to promote digitalisation of licensing services and details of the above new initiatives will be released in due course."
HKSAR Government strongly condemns external forces' smearing on Hong Kong under the pretext of Lai Chee-ying's case,2025-08-13 22:00,2025-08-13 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300849.htm,"âThe Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (August 13) strongly disapproved and rejected the slanderous remarks made by external forces, including anti-China media organisations, regarding Lai Chee-ying's case under the Hong Kong National Security Law and the treatment provided to him during his custody. Their intention to smear and attack the HKSAR Government is blatantly obvious and must be sternly denounced to set the record straight.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""The HKSAR Government has emphasised time and again that as the legal proceedings involving Lai Chee-ying are still ongoing, it is inappropriate for any person to comment on the details of the case in an attempt to interfere with the court to exercise judicial power independently, which might otherwise constitute perverting the course of justice. However, external forces and anti-China media still continue to distort the truth, blatantly discredit the judicial system and trials of the HKSAR, in an attempt to glorify criminal behavior and exert pressure on the courts of the HKSAR.""

CSD correctional facilities are humane and safe

The spokesman reiterated, ""The Correctional Services Department (CSD) attaches great importance to the safety and health of persons-in-custody (PICs). Regardless of the identities, ages and nationalities of PICs, the CSD is committed to ensuring that the custodial environment is secure, safe, humane, appropriate and healthy, and that an environment with good ventilation, as well as appropriate and timely medical support will be provided. If inmates require further examination and treatment, they will be referred to specialist medical staff or to public hospitals for further follow-up. The CSD has also put in place an established mechanism, including regular independent visitors, namely Justices of the Peace, who inspect the prisons to ensure the rights of PICs are protected. The CSD also adopts the above arrangements when handling matters related to Lai Chee-ying, which are no different from those applicable to other PICs.

  ""In fact, Lai Chee-ying's legal representative has already made a clarification earlier that Lai Chee-ying has all along been receiving suitable treatment and care in prison. However, external forces choose to turn a blind eye to these facts and evidence, and carry on with their malicious political maneuvers with ulterior motives. The HKSAR Government strongly opposes such actions.

""We must once again point out the fact that the arrangement for Lai Chee-ying's removal from association from other PICs has all along been made at his own request and approved by the CSD after considering all relevant factors in accordance with the law. The remarks by these external forces regarding Lai Chee-ying's solitary confinement are completely fact-twisting, reflecting a malicious intention to smear and attack the HKSAR Government.""

Upholding the rule of law

The spokesman said, ""Article 5 of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and section 2 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) clearly provide that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing, and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security, and that the right to defend and other rights in judicial proceedings that a criminal suspect, defendant, and other parties in judicial proceedings are entitled to under the law shall be protected. The offences endangering national security stipulated by the HKNSL and SNSO target acts endangering national security with precision, and define the elements and penalties of the offences with clarity. The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, which have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation.

""All cases concerning offence endangering national security will be handled in a fair and timely manner by the law enforcement, prosecution and judicial authorities of the HKSAR as required by Article 42(1) of the HKNSL. The time taken between the institution of prosecution and the completion of trial of each case depends on a multitude of factors. The prosecution and defence will adhere to any direction given by the court to ensure a timely trial.

Freedoms of the press and of speech protected

""Human rights in Hong Kong have always been robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. As far as the media landscape is concerned, it has been as vibrant as ever in the HKSAR since the implementation of the HKNSL and the SNSO. However, freedom of the press and freedom of speech are not absolute. The media, like everyone else, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. As long as they are not in violation of the law, the media continue to enjoy the freedom to comment on and criticise Government policies without any restriction. In recent cases, the Court cited judicial precedents from the European Court of Human Rights regarding freedom of the press, pointing out that the European Convention on Human Rights does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of speech even with respect to press coverage on matters of serious public concern. The most crucial point is that journalists must act in good faith and on accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism' in order to enjoy the protection of their rights to freedom of speech and press freedom.

""The HKSAR will continue to resolutely discharge the responsibility of safeguarding national security, effectively prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities that endanger national security in accordance with the law, and safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people in accordance with the law at the same time,"" the spokesman emphasised."
商經局局長在澳洲出席慶祝悉尼經貿辦成立三十周年酒會（附圖）,2025-08-13 20:38,2025-08-13 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300293.htm,"商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺今日（八月十三日）轉往悉尼，展開澳洲訪問行程，深化香港與澳洲在貿易和投資方面的協作。

抵埗後，丘應樺隨即出席由香港駐悉尼經濟貿易辦事處（悉尼經貿辦）舉辦的酒會，慶祝悉尼經貿辦成立三十周年。

丘應樺在酒會上致辭時表示，悉尼經貿辦於一九九五年成立，肩負起促進及加強香港與澳洲及新西蘭在經濟、貿易和文化方面聯繫的重要使命，並致力加深兩國對香港的認識。過去三十年，悉尼經貿辦一直發揮重要角色，促進香港與澳洲之間的溝通與協作，成為連繫兩地社群的重要橋樑，為未來更深層次的合作奠下堅實基礎。

丘應樺指出，去年香港是澳洲第十大出口市場，雙邊商品貿易額約達80億澳元。同時，澳洲在二○二三年亦是香港第八大服務貿易夥伴。這些數字反映雙方關係日益深化，有賴於雙邊交流日增、共同堅持自由貿易，以及兩地經濟體所展現的創新精神。

他亦提到旅遊業與人員往來在疫情後迅速復蘇，訪港旅客人數回升，香港和澳洲之間的外籍社群亦日益活躍，足證兩地長久以來的緊密聯繫。

此外，丘應樺介紹香港持續推行的多項措施，以優化營商環境及提升地區競爭力，其中包括高端人才通行證計劃，旨在吸引全球優秀人才，推動創新發展；以及近期調低烈酒稅以促進烈酒貿易。他亦提到香港為澳洲企業提供龐大發展機遇，以及作為進入內地和粵港澳大灣區快速增長市場的關鍵切入點角色。

SCED attends reception to celebrate 30th anniversary of Sydney ETO in Australia (with photos),2025-08-13 20:38,2025-08-13 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300294.htm,"  The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau,proceeded to Sydney today (August 13) to start his visit to Australia to deepen collaboration in trade and investment between Hong Kong and Australia.

 Upon arrival, Mr Yau attended a reception hosted by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, Sydney (Sydney ETO) to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its establishment.

 Speaking at the reception, Mr Yau remarked that the Sydney ETO was set up in 1995 with an important mission to promote and strengthen Hong Kong's economic, trade and cultural ties with Australia and New Zealand as well as foster a better understanding of Hong Kong in the two countries. Over the last three decades, the Sydney ETO has played a crucial role in facilitating communication and collaboration between Hong Kong and Australia, serving as a vital connector that brings together the two communities and laying a strong foundation for even deeper co-operation in the years ahead.

 Mr Yau noted that in 2024, Hong Kong was Australia's 10th-largest export market, with bilateral trade in goods between the two places reaching approximately AUD8 billion. Australia was also Hong Kong's eighth-largest trading partner in services in 2023. These figures reflect the deepening of the relationship, fuelled by increased bilateral exchanges, shared commitment to free trade, and the innovative spirit that defines both economies.

 He further noted the strong post-pandemic recovery in tourism and connectivity, citing the growing flow of visitors to Hong Kong and vibrant expatriate communities between Hong Kong and Australia as a testament to the enduring strength of bilateral relations.

 Meanwhile, Mr Yau outlined Hong Kong's ongoing initiatives to enhance its business environment and regional competitiveness, such as the Top Talent Pass Scheme to attract global talent and foster innovation, and the recent reduction of the duty rate on liquor to promote liquor trade. He also highlighted Hong Kong's abundant opportunities for Australian businesses and its role as a key entry point into the fast-growing markets of the Mainland and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

 On regional trade, Mr Yau said that Hong Kong is actively seeking to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and its accession to RCEP will enhance regional value chains and create new synergies in various areas, benefitting Australian exporters, service providers and investors alike.

 Today's reception brought together over 300 distinguished guests from various sectors, including political and business circles, media, academia, community groups and government representatives. A special exhibition highlighted the Sydney ETO's diverse engagements over the past three decades, ranging from hosting high-level visits and leading business delegations to organising economic forums and staging cultural performances, demonstrating the growing depth and breadth of Hong Kong's ties with Australia and New Zealand. Another section of the showcase spotlighted Hong Kong's unique strengths as Asia's world city and a dynamic hub for global business.

 In addition, before proceeding to Sydney today from Auckland, New Zealand, Mr Yau paid a courtesy call on the Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Auckland, Mr Chen Shijie, to update him on the latest social and economic developments in Hong Kong.

 Mr Yau will continue his visit to Sydney tomorrow (August 14)."
商經局局長在澳洲出席慶祝悉尼經貿辦成立三十周年酒會,2025-08-13 20:38,2025-08-13 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300293.htm,"商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺今日（八月十三日）轉往悉尼，展開澳洲訪問行程，深化香港與澳洲在貿易和投資方面的協作。

抵埗後，丘應樺隨即出席由香港駐悉尼經濟貿易辦事處（悉尼經貿辦）舉辦的酒會，慶祝悉尼經貿辦成立三十周年。

丘應樺在酒會上致辭時表示，悉尼經貿辦於一九九五年成立，肩負起促進及加強香港與澳洲及新西蘭在經濟、貿易和文化方面聯繫的重要使命，並致力加深兩國對香港的認識。過去三十年，悉尼經貿辦一直發揮重要角色，促進香港與澳洲之間的溝通與協作，成為連繫兩地社群的重要橋樑，為未來更深層次的合作奠下堅實基礎。

丘應樺指出，去年香港是澳洲第十大出口市場，雙邊商品貿易額約達80億澳元。同時，澳洲在二○二三年亦是香港第八大服務貿易夥伴。這些數字反映雙方關係日益深化，有賴於雙邊交流日增、共同堅持自由貿易，以及兩地經濟體所展現的創新精神。

他亦提到旅遊業與人員往來在疫情後迅速復蘇，訪港旅客人數回升，香港和澳洲之間的外籍社群亦日益活躍，足證兩地長久以來的緊密聯繫。

此外，丘應樺介紹香港持續推行的多項措施，以優化營商環境及提升地區競爭力，其中包括高端人才通行證計劃，旨在吸引全球優秀人才，推動創新發展；以及近期調低烈酒稅以促進烈酒貿易。他亦提到香港為澳洲企業提供龐大發展機遇，以及作為進入內地和粵港澳大灣區快速增長市場的關鍵切入點角色。

在區域貿易層面上，丘應樺表示香港正積極爭取加入《區域全面經濟伙伴關係協定》（《協定》），加入《協定》將提升區域價值鏈及在多方面產生協同效應，惠及澳洲的出口商、服務提供者和投資者。

文化體育及旅遊局局長出席動漫藝術節2025開幕儀式致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-08-13 20:22,2025-08-13 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300787.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（八月十三日）出席動漫藝術節2025開幕儀式的致辭全文：

Raymond (Board of Governors and Chairman of the Arts Programme Committee of the Hong Kong Arts Centre, Mr Raymond Fung), Mr Kim (Co-founder of Superani, Curator of Kim Jung Gi: A Journey to Endless Lines Exhibition, Mr Hyunjin Kim), ladies and gentlemen,

I’m sorry, Mr Kim, that the speech is prepared in Cantonese, so I hope that subsequently there will be a recap for you.

大家晚上好！我很高興出席動漫藝術節2025的開幕儀式。

今年是香港藝術中心首次舉辦大型動漫藝術節，這次藝術節除了呈獻來自60多位藝術家的超過150幅手繪作品，還正如大家聽到Peter（香港藝術中心監督團主席劉文邦）和Rebecca（香港藝術中心總幹事葉思芬）所指，推出藝術快閃商店、現場繪畫示範、公眾導賞團等一系列富有趣味的活動，我相信觀眾可以充分體驗藝術、享受藝術。

香港特區政府一直致力推動文創產業的發展。去年十一月公布的《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》當中明確提出將香港打造成流行文化之都是其中一個很重要的目標。文化體育及旅遊局轄下的文創產業發展處（文創處）以產業導向為原則，透過「創意智優計劃」持續支持本地漫畫家和漫畫企業發展。其中，剛剛在上個月香港動漫電玩節中舉辦的「港漫動力」展館是「創意智優計劃」的其中一個重點項目，當時展出了16間本地企業在計劃支援下出版的全新原創漫畫，有利於培育本地漫畫人才，推動本地原創漫畫發展。

「港漫動力」這項漫畫支援計劃，成功培育了不少新晉漫畫家，當中其中一部作品《達利書店》更在同樣由文創處資助的第五屆香港出版雙年獎，從超過420本涵蓋不同題材的參選出版物中脫穎而出，成為雙年獎歷來第一本獲最高殊榮出版大獎的漫畫書，真的要給予一些掌聲，充分體現了政府資助對於藝術發展、漫畫發展有很大的幫助。

此外，業界在推動文創產業發展方面的成效亦有目共睹。現在、今個月在香港正舉辦大受歡迎的「CHIIKAWA DAYS」大型特展，其主辦單位AllRightsReserved其實在過去一年亦先後主辦《100%多啦A夢&FRIENDS巡迴特展（香港）》及《PANDA GO!香港遊》，均成功吸引大批市民及旅客蜂湧參觀，感受潮流文化所帶來的多元魅力及無窮歡樂。還有兩日，海洋公園的龍鳳胎大熊貓加加和得得便一歲生日，海洋公園亦根據香港六隻大熊貓的外型特徵打造Panda Friends IP，推出不同商品，並授權不同品牌使用有關IP推出聯乘產品，均大受歡迎。最近，為了慶祝大熊貓加加和得得一歲生日，香港旅遊發展局與香港藝術家龍家昇合作，推出大熊貓生日特別版Labubu，讓我們可以透過知名IP向全球宣傳推廣香港及熊貓旅遊。

香港藝術中心一直積極舉辦各類藝術活動，推動藝術教育。今日的動漫藝術節，不僅呈獻殿堂級大師經典作品，還為大家展示來自新晉創作人，以致同學、學生們的手繪作品，有利於推動香港動漫藝術和文創產業的發展。我也很希望在往後的特展，展示的是我們香港藝術家、漫畫藝術家、你們的IP、你們的作品、你們的人物。

我希望大家積極參與這次動漫藝術節，為本地藝術家喝采亦期待大家繼續支持香港藝術中心和本地藝術家。祝願動漫藝術節2025圓滿成功，祝願各位觀眾有一個難忘而富啓發性的藝術體驗。謝謝大家。"
特區政府強烈譴責外部勢力假借「黎智英案」抹黑香港,2025-08-13 20:13,2025-08-13 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300801.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（八月十三日）對外部勢力，包括反華傳媒機構，就黎智英涉及《香港國安法》案件，以及其羈押情況的抹黑言論，表示強烈不滿及反對。他們污衊和攻擊特區政府的險惡用心昭然若揭，必須嚴厲直斥其非，以正視聽。

特區政府發言人指出：「特區政府已多次強調，由於黎智英所涉及的法律程序尚在進行中，任何人均不應評論有關案件以圖干預法院獨立進行審判，否則可能構成妨礙司法公正。雖然如此，外部勢力和反華媒體仍繼續顛倒是非、公然抹黑香港特區的司法制度和審訊，企圖美化犯罪行為及向特區法院施壓。」

懲教院所人道安全

發言人重申：「懲教署一直極為重視在囚人士的安全及健康。不論在囚人士的身分、年齡和國籍，署方一直致力為其提供安全、人道、合適和健康的羈管環境，包括提供良好的通風環境、合適和及時的醫療支援。有需要的在囚人士也會獲轉介到診專科醫療人員或至公立醫院繼續跟進。懲教署也設有一系列機制，例如透過獨立訪客（即太平紳士）定期巡視的安排，以確保在囚人士的權利獲得保障。懲教署處理黎智英相關事宜，均採取上述安排，與其他在囚人士無異。」

「事實上，黎智英的代表律師早已澄清，清楚指出黎智英在獄中一直獲得適切的治療和待遇，但反華勢力卻選擇對有關事實和證據視而不見，繼續其別有用心的卑劣政治操作，特區政府對此表示強烈不滿及反對。」

「我們必須再次指出事實，有關黎智英與其他囚犯中止交往的安排，一直是根據黎智英本人的意願並由懲教署經考慮所有相關因素後依法安排的。這些反華勢力企圖藉黎智英被單獨監禁一事作出失實言論，攻擊特區政府，用心險惡。」

堅守法治原則

發言人表示：「《香港國安法》第五條和《維護國家安全條例》第2條明確訂明防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪，應當堅持法治原則，並保障犯罪嫌疑人、被告人和其他訴訟參與人依法享有的辯護權和其他訴訟權利。《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》訂明的危害國家安全的罪行精準針對危害國家安全的行為，清楚訂明構成有關罪行的元素和刑罰。香港特區執法部門一直根據證據、嚴格依照法律，以及按有關人士或單位的行為而採取執法行動，與涉事人士或組織的政治立場、背景或職業無關。」

「特區的執法、檢控及司法機關在處理危害國家安全犯罪案件時，均會嚴格遵循《香港國安法》第四十二條第一款的規定，公正、及時辦理有關案件。每宗案件由提出檢控直至審訊完成所需的時間，視乎多項因素而定。控辯雙方會跟從法庭給予的指示，確保及時審理有關案件。」

新聞和言論自由獲保障

「人權在香港一直受到《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實憲制保障。就傳媒環境而言，自《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》實施以來，香港特區的傳媒環境蓬勃依然。然而，新聞和言論自由並非絕對，傳媒與其他人一樣都有義務遵守所有法律。只要不違法，傳媒繼續享有評論和批評政府施政的自由，全然不受限制。法庭在近年的案件引用了歐洲人權法院關於新聞自由的判例，指出即使是報道涉及備受公眾關注的重要議題，在《歐洲人權公約》下也不享有完全不受限制的言論自由；最重要的一點是，新聞工作者必須按『負責任新聞作業』原則真誠地行事，以準確事實為基礎，並提供準確可靠的資訊，方可獲言論和新聞自由權利保障。」

發言人強調：「香港特區會繼續堅定不移地履行維護國家安全的責任，依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，同時依法保障香港市民的權利和自由。」"
食環署因應基孔肯雅熱輸入個案持續在葵青區加強控蚊滅蚊工作（附圖）,2025-08-13 20:13,2025-08-13 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300731.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）發言人今日（八月十三日）表示，因應衞生署衞生防護中心昨晚（八月十二日）公布的一宗基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，食環署已立即在患者居住的葵青區打磚坪街一帶多個地點展開滅蚊工作，包括清除積水、清掃街道及施放蚊藥等，減低疾病傳播風險。食環署亦會在區內召開「跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組」會議，協調各部門及持份者共同採取防治蚊患行動。

打磚坪街一帶有工業及回收作業進行，食環署人員巡查發現回收店鋪將物品放置在公眾地方，已向違例人士提出檢控，並要求即時移走阻街物品。就附近私人範圍堆積的物品，食環署已警告負責人必須妥善處理，以避免蚊蟲滋生，否則會被檢控。

此外，食環署在巡查期間發現附近大廈單位有冷氣機滴水，導致部分後巷出現積水。食環署會向有關處所的業主／佔用人發出法定通知，指示其在指定限期內糾正情況。同時，食環署已就後巷路面凹凸不平的情況轉介相關部門跟進，以長遠避免積水問題再現。

另外，食環署今早聯同葵青區區議員向商戶和市民派發防蚊宣傳單張，提高居民的防蚊意識。食環署亦會繼續在昨晚公布的個案患者住所250米範圍內進行病媒調查，如發現蚊子滋生地會立即跟進，包括清除積水及霧化殺滅成蚊等。

近日公布的輸入個案中亦有居於葵青區的患者，食環署聯同相關部門及持份者在患者住所附近的控蚊滅蚊工作會持續進行，以減低疾病傳播風險，亦會與地區人士合作加強宣傳教育，提高市民的防蚊意識。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：


收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


市民可參考食環署有關防控蚊患的網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/risk-pest-mosquito.html#），亦應持續留意衞生署衞生防護中心發出有關基孔肯雅熱的資訊。如有發現蚊患情況，請致電1823。"

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-08-13 19:26,2025-08-13 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300759.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 13), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. The CHP reminded members of the public to take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures, especially upon returning to Hong Kong from regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. Individuals experiencing symptoms such as fever or acute joint pain should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors of their travel history. Do not attempt self-testing, as this may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Regarding the probable case involving a 22-year-old female announced earlier, the CHP collected another blood sample from the patient on August 11 (i.e. the 17th day after the onset of symptoms) for testing. The result indicated that she had been infected during her trip to Madagascar and had already recovered. Therefore, the case is not classified as a confirmed case in Hong Kong.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of six confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

""According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, in the past week (August 3 to 9), there were 1 387 new CF cases in Guangdong, a significant decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 2 892 cases (July 27 to August 2) and 2 940 cases (July 20 to 26) respectively. All the cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. However, we must remain vigilant and continue to adopt a multipronged approach to prevent local transmission,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow up when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. They have also reminded residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of CF.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

Dr Tsui reminded members of the public, currently, there are no rapid test products on the market that have been certified by international health authorities for public use in self-testing for CF. They should promptly seek medical advice if they suspect they are infected with CF and not to conduct testing on their own as this may delay proper clinical treatment. He also urged the public not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example, increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms because it may lead to ""Reye's syndrome"", a serious and potentially fatal complication.

He also added that members of the public should adopt precautions during the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can effectively prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 andpicaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


In addition, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Tuen Mun Hospital announces incident involving patient's ventilator identified as not being in normal operating mode,2025-08-13 18:50,2025-08-13 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300700.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

âThe spokesperson for Tuen Mun Hospital made the following announcement today (August 13) regarding an incident involving a patient's ventilator that was identified as not being in normal operating mode:

On August 7, a 48-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital's Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with acute necrotising pancreatitis, complicated by acute kidney injury and respiratory failure. He was started on continuous renal replacement therapy. As the patient's condition remained critical, healthcare staff intubated him and connected him to a mechanical ventilator on August 10 to assist with his breathing.

At about 7am yesterday (August 12), healthcare staff made adjustments to the ventilator and replaced the respiratory circuit. After four minutes, the patient developed oxygen desaturation, triggering the alarm system. Healthcare staff attended to the patient correspondingly. During this period, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest. The clinical team initiated resuscitation promptly, and the patient's heartbeat was restored two minutes later. During the resuscitation, it was discovered that the ventilator was not in normal operating mode, and the staff rectified the equipment's operation mode immediately to enable resumption of normal operation.

The patient was conscious and able to respond to the instructions of the healthcare staff after the event. A thorough assessment and relevant examinations have been conducted, showing that patient's vital signs were stable. A Computerised Tomography Scan has been done, and the clinical team has initially determined that the incident had no significant impact on his overall condition. The clinical team will continue to closely monitor the patient's clinical condition and provide appropriate treatment.

The hospital is very concerned about the incident and met with the patient's family to explain the details of the incident. The hospital will maintain close communication with the family, offering all possible assistance and follow-up care. The patient is still hospitalised in ICU due to his underlying diseases.

The hospital has reported the incident to the Hospital Authority Head Office through the Advance Incident Reporting System. The hospital will investigate the reasons why the ventilator was not in normal operating mode and make recommendations to prevent recurrence of similar events."

 During the meeting with the Chief Executive Officer of the HSA of Singapore, Professor Raymond Chua, Professor Lo said, ""Protecting public health and tackling public health challenges transcend borders. International co-operation is indispensable in ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of drugs and medical devices, as well as in enhancing tobacco control to protect community health. I look forward to Hong Kong and Singapore collaborating to create synergy and share the best practices to bolster public health protection and promote medical innovation, thereby further strengthening the healthy and steady development of the healthcare systems in both places.""

 After the meeting, Professor Lo and Singapore's Coordinating Minister for Social Policies and the Minister for Health, Mr Ong Ye Kung, jointly witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on regulation of drugs and medical devices and tobacco control policy by the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, and Professor Chua. The MOU aims to enhance the co-operation between the two places in areas such as regulation of drugs and medical devices, promoting tobacco control policy and enforcement, as well as regulatory capacity enhancement and training, with a view to jointly promoting the high-quality development of the regulation of drugs and medical devices.

 During the meeting with the founding Executive Director of CoRE, Professor John Lim, Professor Lo introduced the initiatives put forward by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government in developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub, including strengthening the approval regimes for drugs and medical devices, as well as establishing the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation by the end of 2026 to foster growth in the local healthcare and biotechnology industries.

 Professor Lo also gained insights on CoRE's significant contributions to Singapore's healthcare regulatory system over the past decade through capacity building, strengthening collaboration and fostering innovation.

 Professor Lo said, ""Hong Kong is pressing ahead with reforms of the regulatory system of drugs and medical devices to address evolving healthcare needs and the rapid development of advanced treatment technologies. The valuable experience of CoRE in nurturing talent and promoting regulation of drugs and medical devices provides practical and useful reference for our ongoing reforms.""

 Apart from Dr Lam, members of the delegation include Deputy Secretary for Health Ms Elaine Mak and a representative from the Hospital Authority. They will visit the National Cancer Centre Singapore, a polyclinic and a pharmaceuticalcompany tomorrow (August 14), and depart for Hong Kong in the evening."

Man convicted and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2025-08-13 18:31,2025-08-13 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300721.htm,"âA 49-year-old man was convicted and sentenced to three years' imprisonment at the District Court today (August 13) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes, in contravention of the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO).

Customs intercepted a container vessel in the waters off Lamma Island on July 24, 2024. Upon inspection, Customs officers seized 30.4 million duty-not-paid cigarettes on the vessel, with an estimated market value of about $137 million and a duty potential of about $100.5 million. The male coxswain, aged 49, was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offence.

Customs stresses that smuggling is a serious offence. Under the IEO, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction. Moreover, under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Customs will continue to combat cross-boundary illicit cigarette smuggling activities with firm enforcement action.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
