Grading of beach water quality released,2026-01-23 16:00,2026-01-23 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/23/P2026012300340.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (January 23) released the latest grading of water quality for six gazetted beaches that are open all year round for swimming.

  Six beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Golden Beach


Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Lido Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Silverstrand Beach




  Compared with the grading released last week, there was no change in the grading for these beaches.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast)."

蔡冠深主席（世界華商聯合促進會主席）、章征宇會長（世界華商聯合促進會會長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

 大家好！今天是世界華商聯合促進會（華商聯）第五屆理事會的就職典禮，華商聯同時舉辦「香港繁榮」高峰論壇。我祝賀華商聯會務昌隆、論壇成果豐碩。

華商聯自二○○七年成立以來，在歷屆領導帶領下，一直凝聚全球華商，通過舉辦涵蓋經貿發展、文化產業等主題的論壇，發揮橋樑紐帶作用，為海內外華人華商提供交流平台，多年來的努力值得肯定。今天論壇聚焦國家「十五五」規劃與香港發展定位，正好為社會提供集思平台，就不同議題匯聚智慧，共謀未來。

去年十月，二十屆四中全會勝利舉行，對「十五五」時期國家經濟社會發展作出戰略擘畫。「十五五」規劃建議支持香港更好融入和服務國家發展大局、鞏固提升粵港澳大灣區高質量發展動力源作用。建議指出，要鞏固提升香港國際金融、航運、貿易中心地位，支持香港建設國際創新科技中心，和打造國際高端人才集聚高地。

風好正揚帆，香港必定積極有為，主動對接國家「十五五」規劃，扎實推動經濟高質量發展，深度參與粵港澳大灣區建設。以下，我從五方面介紹香港正全力推動的發展工作。

第一，深化國際合作，拓展全球機遇。面對地緣政治千變萬化，全球對「中國製造」產品需求增強。香港會善用「一國兩制」下擁有國家機遇和國際機遇的雙重疊加優勢，積極拓展全球經貿網絡，全力發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」角色。我們已成立內地企業出海專班，以專業高增值服務，協助企業在香港設立財資中心和區域總部，攜手拓展海外市場。

第二，推進灣區融合，釋放協同效應。香港將持續為大灣區建設貢獻力量，暢通大灣區人流、物流、數據流、資金流。其中，我們正推進香港國際機場東莞空港中心，引入更多高增值物流和跨境電商設施，更好服務區域貨運需求。

第三，鞏固制度優勢，提升中心功能。香港是享譽全球的國際金融、航運、貿易中心，我們會加速發展新增長點，包括建立國際黃金交易中心，豐富離岸人民幣市場業務，建設大宗商品交易生態圈。我們同時正建立通達內地內陸省市的「鐵海陸江」立體聯運體系，高效聯通內地廣闊市場。

第四，聚焦創科驅動，賦能未來發展。政府正提速提效發展北部都會區（北都）和位於北都、與深圳相鄰的河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區。香港園區已正式開園，我們將協同大灣區城市共建國際科技創新中心，全力發展新質生產力，為國家高水平科技自立自強貢獻更大力量。

第五，匯聚高端人才，建立發展根基。教育、科技、人才一體化發展，是新時代發展重要支撐。香港在世界人才排名中，躍升至全球第四、亞太第一。香港也是全球唯一擁有五所百強大學的城市，我們將加速建設北都大學城，推廣「留學香港」品牌，積極發展香港成為國際專上教育樞紐和國際高端人才集聚高地。

同心山成玉，協力土變金。全力對接「十五五」規劃，將為香港開創新局帶來更大機遇，讓我們更好融入和服務國家發展大局。我期待華商聯繼續與特區政府攜手並肩，共同為國家高質量發展貢獻力量。

最後，我祝願今天活動圓滿成功，在座各位事業宏達、身體健康。謝謝大家。"

An FEHD spokesman said, ""The annual year-end clean-up campaign started today and will last for 21 days. During the campaign, cleaning efforts will be enhanced in all districts to improve community hygiene and maintain a clean and hygienic environment in Hong Kong.""

Throughout the campaign, the FEHD will step up the cleaning of public facilities under its management, such as markets, cooked food centres, hawker bazaars, public toilets and refuse collection points. The FEHD will enhance inspections and strengthen cleaning of problematic sites with illegal refuse dumping and other public cleanliness offences, such as rear lanes and hygiene blackspots. Furthermore, the FEHD will deploy additional mini-street washing vehicle teams equipped with pressure washer surface cleaners to enhance street cleaning services in densely populated areas and popular tourist spots. FEHD staff will increase inspections, cleaning and disinfection of communal areas and market facilities, reminding stall tenants to thoroughly clean their stalls.

In addition, the FEHD will conduct mosquito and rodent prevention and control operations in places such as old tenement buildings, streets, rear lanes, village houses and construction sites based on district needs, especially enhancing night rodent control measures.

The spokesman added that to ensure the cleanliness of public places, the department will continue to strengthen enforcement and issue fixed penalty notices to those who violate public cleanliness and obstruction regulations.

For more information about the year-end clean-up campaign and environmental hygiene, please visit the FEHD website at www.fehd.gov.hk.

The spokesman stressed that maintaining a clean and hygienic community hinges on the active participation and collective efforts of the public to enjoy a clean environment together in the upcoming Lunar New Year."

  ""With the onboarding of all MPF schemes to the eMPF Platform, it is anticipated that over 10 million MPF scheme members could enjoy fee reductions, representing more than 90 per cent of all scheme member accounts. At the same time, the Government will make use of the favourable conditions created by the eMPF Platform to implement other MPF reform initiatives, including the Phase One Proposal of MPF 'Full Portability' for which legislative amendments were completed last year,"" a spokesperson for the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau said.

  If scheme members/employers have any questions regarding the detailed operation of the eMPF Platform, they may visit the Platform's official website (empf.org.hk), or call the Platform's customer service hotline (183 2622).

  The aforementioned legal notices will be tabled at the Legislative Council for negative vetting on January 28, 2026.

Tenders invited for development of Advanced Construction Industry Building in Tsing Yi,2026-01-23 11:00,2026-01-23 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/23/P2026012300228.htm,"The Government today (January 23) launched an open tender for the development of the Advanced Construction Industry Building (ACIB) in Tsing Yi (Contract No. WT/002/25) under a two-envelope approach. The tender invitation will close at noon on April 22.

A spokesman for the Development Bureau (DEVB) said that the ACIB in Tsing Yi, covering an area of about three hectares, will be the first multi-storey advanced facility dedicated to the construction industry, aiming to drive the adoption of advanced construction technologies and enhance productivity and efficiency through synergy. It will facilitate the sustainable development of the construction industry and enable better land use. The land is being used by a low-density steel rebar prefabrication yard under a short-term tenancy. The Government will utilise the land to develop the multi-storey ACIB, providing more floor areas to set up advanced manufacturing facilities related to the construction industry. Construction is scheduled to commence in the second half of 2026, with commissioning targeted for 2028.

The 2025 Policy Address announced that the DEVB would take forward the ACIB project to provide a dedicated facility for the construction industry, featuring a multi-storey design to house steel rebar prefabrication yards, processing sites for Multi-trade Integrated Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MiMEP), and other advanced manufacturing facilities, so as to promote wider adoption of high productivity construction methods in the industry and enhance new quality productive forces. In May 2025, the DEVB invited the market to submit expressions of interest for this project and offer innovative and practicable suggestions on the relevant advanced facilities in the building. The Bureau subsequently reviewed seven submissions received mainly from local and Mainland contractors and operators related to the construction industry. The views collected were used to formulate the details of the open tender.

Under the 30-year contract adopting a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) approach, the successful tenderer will be responsible for project financing, design, construction and operation. Upon expiry of the contract, the whole building including all manufacturing facilities and equipment shall be transferred to the Government. Advanced production facilities to be provided in the ACIB shall include:

(1) Not less than 15000 square metres of floor area for steel rebar prefabrication yards;
(2) Not less than 5000 sq m of floor area for MiMEP processing sites; and
(3) Not less than 5000 sq m of floor area for lease to the industry for operating steel rebar prefabrication yards or MiMEP processing sites.

The successful tenderer shall be responsible for operating the facilities (1) and (2) above, which must possess a minimum annual production capacity of 300000 tonnes of prefabricated steel rebar and 6 000 MiMEP modules.

Under the two-envelope tender arrangement, a weighting of 70 per cent will be allocated to the assessment of the non-price proposal and 30 per cent to the price proposal. The tender must comply with both the non-price and price requirements. The assessment criteria for the non-price proposal mainly include the tenderer's experience in managing and operating manufacturing facilities relevant to the construction industry, the overall planning and design of the building, innovative technologies for constructing and operating the advanced manufacturing building and facilities, the annual production capacity of the facilities, and other proposed advanced manufacturing facilities. The detailed assessment criteria are set out in the tender documents.

The tender notice was gazetted today and uploaded to the DEVB's website (www.devb.gov.hk/en/tender_notices/index.html). Interested companies with the capability to deliver the project, including developers, contractors and operators, may download the tender documents from the e-Tender Box (ETB) under the Procurement and Contract Management System of the Government Logistics Department (pcms2.gld.gov.hk). Tenderers may submit their tenders via the ETB or deposit them in the tender box as specified in the tender notice before the tender closing time.

早上，陳茂波出席以「如何為減碳項目融資」為主題的專題會議，並擔任發言嘉賓。會議聚焦討論在全球經濟增長放緩、先進經濟體債務高企和地緣政治等因素影響下，如何透過公、私營合作，繼續支持實現碳中和的目標。

陳茂波在對談環節中指出，國家和香港都正堅定並穩步邁向碳中和的目標。他分享了香港二○五○年實現碳中和的目標以及實踐的策略，其中，通過政府政策的誘導以促使企業和消費者的行為改變，例如為電動車提供稅務減免、為綠色建築提供誘因。此外，也為可持續氫能交通工具等的試驗提供財政支持，鼓勵探索創新。

另一方面，香港作為國際金融中心，通過豐富的綠色金融產品生態，例如綠色債券、環境、社會和管治（ESG）基金等，積極引導私人資本參與減碳進程。特區政府又鼓勵金融創新，例如發行代幣化綠色債券，讓更多投資者可以參與到綠色項目；把基建項目貸款證券化，以釋出資金再投資到新的項目等。

陳茂波指出，公眾的支持和信任是實現綠色轉型的關鍵，特區政府通過制定與國際接軌的標準，包括可持續分類目錄和披露標準等，確保資金真正用於綠色項目。而對於海內外例如礦產公司等高排放企業，來港上市集資除可獲得市場資金支持其發展外，也提升其治理水平、透明度和在全球市場上的認受性。

陳茂波昨日亦繼續與各地政商界及國際組織領袖會面，包括世界經濟論壇總裁兼首席執行官博爾格‧布倫德，以及國際貨幣基金組織第一副總裁丹·卡茨，就環球金融和共同關心的議題交流看法，並分享香港的觀點。

陳茂波又分別會見羅兵咸永道全球主席康慕德、AXA安盛集團行政總裁Thomas Buberl和Amazon Web Services全球公共政策副總裁Michael Punke等，就當前環球經濟、市場情況和技術發展等議題交換意見。

During the discussion session, Mr Chan pointed out that both the country and Hong Kong are firmly and steadily progressing towards the goal of carbon neutrality. He shared Hong Kong's target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and the strategies to realise it. These include leveraging government policy to steer behavioural changes among enterprises and consumers, such as providing tax concessions for electric vehicles and incentives for green buildings. He also mentioned financial support for trials of innovative technologies, such as sustainable hydrogen-powered transport, to encourage innovation.

As an international financial centre, Hong Kong actively facilitates private capital participation in the decarbonisation process through a rich green finance ecosystem, such as green bonds and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) funds. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government also encourages financial innovation, including the issuance of tokenised green bonds to allow wider investor participation in green projects, and the securitisation of loans for infrastructure projects to release capital for reinvestment into new projects.

Mr Chan stressed that public support and trust are key to achieving a green transition. The HKSAR Government ensures that funds are genuinely used for green projects by formulating internationally aligned standards, including a green taxonomy and disclosure requirements. For high-emission enterprises, such as mining companies, listing in Hong Kong not only enables them to access capital to support their development but also helps enhance their corporate governance, transparency and recognition in global markets.

Mr Chan also continued to meet with leaders from political, business and international organisations yesterday, including the President and Chief Executive Officer of the WEF, Mr Børge Brende, and the First Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Mr Dan Katz, to exchange views on global finance and issues of mutual concern, and to share Hong Kong's perspective.

Mr Chan also held separate meetings with the Global Chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Mr Mohamed Kande; the Chief Executive Officer of AXA Group, Mr Thomas Buberl; and the Vice President of Global Public Policy of Amazon Web Services, Mr Michael Punke, to exchange views on the current global economic and market situation, as well as technological development.

Mr Chan has concluded his visit to Davos. He will depart Switzerland today (January 23, Davos time), and return to Hong Kong on Saturday morning (January 24, Hong Kong time)."
天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-23 06:46,2026-01-23 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/23/P2026012300117.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月二十三日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

有關更多健康資訊，可致電衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111），或參閱衞生防護中心網頁和Facebook專頁，以及勞工處於在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，對僱主及僱員發布應採取預防措施的新聞公報。

CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-23 06:46,2026-01-23 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/23/P2026012300116.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 23) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

HKSAR Government vehemently opposes the so-called resolution of European Parliament,2026-01-23 00:41,2026-01-23 01:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/23/P2026012300009.htm,"​The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government yesterday (January 22) vehemently opposed the so-called resolution adopted by the European Parliament against Hong Kong, and strongly condemned the Parliament for using the Lai Chee-ying case to make baseless allegations about Hong Kong and smear the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO), so as to set the record straight.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""The European Parliament has made sweepingly generalised and grandstanding comments, completely disregarding the profound historical significance of the HKNSL and its undeniable positive impact on the HKSAR. It has rather distorted the facts and smeared the HKSAR and the HKNSL as well as other laws safeguarding national security in Hong Kong. On the contrary, they never utter a word about the strict enforcement of national security laws by other governments against activities that endanger their national security. This is an entirely despicable political manipulation, and we must sternly denounce wrongdoing of the European Parliament to set the record straight and to expose its shameless 'double standards' to the world.""

  ""In addition, the European Parliament has entirely no respect for the HKSAR court's independent judgment of the Lai Chee-Ying case, which had been made on the basis of facts and evidence. They also refused to acknowledge the evidence set out in the reasons for verdict, and refused to understand the court's considerations and the reasons for verdict. Instead, they wantonly launched attacks, slandered and attacked the HKSAR Government. With the European Parliament distorting facts and confounding right and wrong, its malicious intentions are clearly revealed.""

Positive effects of laws safeguarding national security of HKSAR

The spokesman emphasises, ""Safeguarding national security is a top priority of every country. In accordance with international law and international relations based on the Charter of the United Nations, it is each and every sovereign state's inherent right to enact laws safeguarding national security, and it is also an international practice. Various countries in Europe have also enacted their own laws safeguarding national security. Acts and activities endangering national security could bring very serious consequences. No country will watch with folded arms and tolerate any of such acts and activities endangering national security without taking any action. Any acts of disregarding the facts and smearing HKSAR's work in safeguarding national security are hypocritical and irresponsible, and will not win any public support.""

""For a considerable period, external forces, through their agents, have conducted infiltration and sabotage activities in Hong Kong, and further instigated the 'black-clad violence' and the Hong Kong version of 'colour revolution' in 2019, which nearly brought the 'one country, two systems' to ruin. With the promulgation and implementation of the HKNSL, its effect in stopping violence and curbing disorder as well as quickly restoring social stability in the Hong Kong community was immediate. The HKSAR fulfilled its constitutional duty by enacting the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) in 2024 with broad societal consensus, thereby improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security. This has enabled Hong Kong's transition 'from chaos to order' and advancement 'from stability to prosperity'.""

""The attempts by external forces to 'use Hong Kong to contain China' are doomed to fail, leaving them with no option but to smear the HKNSL. However, the facts are clear for all to see, and both Hong Kong citizens and international investors have a discerning eye. Over five years of its implementation, the HKNSL has restored the rights and freedoms that Hong Kong citizens were unable to enjoy during the period of 'black-clad violence', and has enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community at large to swiftly return to normal and the business environment to be restored and improved continuously. According to the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025, Hong Kong's ranking improved by two places to third globally. Also, Hong Kong continues to rank among the top three international financial centres. These internationally recognised achievements are built upon the freedom and stability brought to Hong Kong society by the HKNSL, other relevant laws of the HKSAR, and the work of safeguarding national security.""

Court's conviction verdict for the Lai Chee-Ying case was entirely free from any political considerations

""The court's reasons for verdict in the Lai Chee-ying case are 855 pages long, which are fully open for public inspection, and include the court's analysis of the relevant legal principles and evidence, as well as the reasons for convicting Lai Chee-ying and the three defendant companies in full detail. The court clearly pointed out in the reasons for verdict that Lai Chee-ying was not on trial for his political views or beliefs. The court's conviction verdict is well-founded and reasoned, fully demonstrating that the court has made its decision on the case strictly in accordance with the law and evidence, free from any interference, and absolutely free of any political considerations.""

The spokesperson stressed, ""Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law and has always adhered to the principle that laws must be obeyed and lawbreakers be held accountable. Article 5 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security. Any suggestion that certain individuals or organisations should be immune from legal consequences for their illegal acts is no different from advocating a special privilege to break the law, and this totally runs contrary to the spirit of the rule of law.""

The Lai Chee-ying case has nothing to do with freedom of the press at all

The spokesperson emphasised, ""The Lai Chee-ying case has nothing to do with freedom of the press at all. Over the years, the defendants have used journalism as a guise to commit acts that brought harm to our country and Hong Kong. Lai Chee-ying was fundamentally the mastermind behind a series of anti-China and destabilising activities in Hong Kong, and was no doubt an agent of external anti-China forces. The public trial of this case revealed Lai Chee-ying's close management and hands-on control of the editorial direction of Apple Daily, and one of the senior managers even said they were free within a 'bird cage'.

""Hong Kong citizens enjoy freedom of the press and freedom of speech as protected under the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. In fact, the HKNSL and the SNSO clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security. The rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of the press, of speech and of publication, enjoyed by Hong Kong people under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to the HKSAR, are protected in accordance with the law. Similar to all other places in the world, journalists, just like other citizens, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. According to the principles established by Article 19 of the ICCPR, the European Convention on Human Rights and relevant jurisprudence, when the media and journalists publish opinions, information and articles, they must observe and discharge 'special duties and responsibilities', including protection of national security and public order. Journalists must, in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism', act in good faith on accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information, so as to be entitled to the protection of freedom of speech and press freedom.

Lai Chee-ying's health has been properly cared for

The spokesperson said, ""The Correctional Services Department (CSD) handles the custodial arrangements for Lai Chee-ying in the same way as other persons-in-custody (PICs). The CSD attaches great importance to the safety and health of PICs. Regardless of the identities, ages and nationalities of PICs, the CSD is committed to ensuring that the custodial environment is secure, safe, humane, appropriate and healthy, which includes appropriate and timely medical support.

""The medical services received by Lai Chee-ying in custody are adequate and comprehensive. All correctional institutions have hospitals or sick bays staffed 24 hours a day by Medical Officers seconded from the Department of Health (DH) and correctional staff with professional nursing qualifications. Medical specialists from the Hospital Authority and the DH will visit correctional institutions on a regular basis to provide PICs with specialist consultation and treatment. In serious cases, PICs will be transferred immediately to a public hospital for treatment.

""During the public court hearing in August 2025, the senior counsel representing Lai Chee-ying clearly presented to the court that Lai Chee-ying had all along been receiving appropriate treatment and care in prison. The correctional institutions had been arranging daily medical checkups for Lai Chee-ying and that there had been no complaints at all regarding the medical services he was receiving, and the Court also commended the CSD. In the open hearing on January 12, the senior counsel representing Lai Chee-ying once again confirmed that Lai Chee-ying had no complaint at all regarding his custodial arrangements.

The spokesman pointed out, ""Anyone who vilify the rule of law and human rights situation in the HKSAR using this case is fact-twisting and has no integrity at all. The HKSAR Government strongly urges the European Parliament to understand the facts relating to the Lai Chee-ying case as soon as possible, and it is never too late to mend. The HKSAR Government will continue to resolutely, fully and faithfully implement the HKNSL, the SNSO and other relevant laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, to effectively prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law, whilst upholding the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents in accordance with the law, so as to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of the principle of 'one country, two systems'."""
The Government responds to Coroner's verdict on death inquest for vessel collision incident near Lamma Island in 2012,2026-01-22 23:57,2026-01-23 00:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200799.htm,"​The Coroner's Court today (January 22) finished reading the verdict on the cause of death of the passengers involved in the vessel collision incident near Lamma Island in 2012.

​A Government spokesman said the Government respects the judgment of the Coroner's Court and would study the verdict carefully with serious follow-up. At the same time, the Government expresses its deepest condolences to the families. After the incident, the Government conducted two investigations, including the one conducted by the Commission of Inquiry (CoI) established in accordance with the Commission of Inquiry Ordinance and the internal investigation led by then-Transport and Housing Bureau (then-THB); and accepted the expert reports under various investigations.

The Transport and Logistics Bureau has all along been supervising the Marine Department (MD) in following up on the recommendations of the CoI and the experts, and in adopting a systemic approach for fully implementing five categories of measures to enhance marine safety and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents. Relevant measures include -


Enhancing safety standards onboard: including requiring all passenger vessels' watertight doors to be fitted with visual and audio alarms; specifying the requirements of watertight door warning markings; improving the labelling and placement of life jackets; and establishing standards for securing seats to the deck;
Improving plan approval and vessel survey standards: including the creation of a dedicated team for plan approval for local vessels; introduction of standardised procedures for vessel surveys and plan approvals; introduction of the tripartite Inspection and Test Plan Scheme (ITP) for high-risk vessels by requiring the shipyard, shipowner and the MD to reach a consensus on important test items and acceptance criteria to clarify any misunderstanding or ambiguity regarding design and regulatory requirements, thus ensuring a vessel's watertight integrity and compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements;
Promoting operational safety within the industry: including the introduction of the common life jacket for use by adults and children; the enactment of the Marine Safety (Alcohol and Drugs) Ordinance to regulate drink and drug boating; and the mandate of lookout arrangements onboard vessels;
​Strengthening industry professionalism and promoting safety culture: including the introduction of the Fast Speed Passenger Vessel Endorsement regime to enhance coxswains' and engine operators' navigational skills and ability to handle emergency situations, as well as the introduction of the Local Safety Management System; and
Introducing systemic reform of the MD's management and regulatory regime: including strengthening professional development of MD officers; launching of the electronic vessel survey system and introducing the use of electronic certificates to enhance work efficiency and quality.


Please refer to the Annex for details of the relevant measures.

As for the responsibilities of the MD officers involved, the then-THB forwarded the internal investigation report (THB Report) to the Civil Service Bureau (CSB) for follow-up, and the CSB has, in accordance with the recommendations in the THB Report and the legal advice from the Department of Justice, took actions according to the disciplinary procedures and finished following up on the relevant cases. There were also two MD officers involved who were criminally prosecuted and sentenced to imprisonment.

As regards the recommendations of the Coroner for the MD, including (1) to continue regular engagement with shipbuilders, marine transport service operators and relevant professional bodies or issue simple guidance notes or clarification to ensure that they understand the application of relevant rules and regulations; (2) to implement a new declaration system requiring vessel owners, before each periodical survey, to confirm whether any alterations have been made since the previous survey; (3) to continue to review the working hours and rest arrangements of seafarers, with a focus on identifying fatigue risks in day-to-day operations, and with major ferry operators consulted in the process and the Local Vessels Advisory Committee used as a forum for relevant discussions; and (4) to disseminate to the trade information on the recommendations the Coroner gave to Cheoy Lee Shipyards, the MD will seriously study them and follow up. In respect of the first recommendation, the MD has been stepping up communication with the industry and implemented the Local Safety Management system, with the adoption of a proactive risk management approach to enhance communication with the industry on marine safety issues. For the second recommendation, the MD is actively preparing for the introduction of a requirement under the existing ship inspection system that shipowners must declare that there were no unauthorised alterations of the vessels concerned prior to a survey. In respect of the third recommendation, the Government will review the working environment and conditions of local seafarers and will thoroughly consult relevant stakeholders. For the fourth recommendation, the MD will communicate with other shipyards in respect of the relevant issue.

Government responds to Coroner's verdict on death inquest for vessel collision incident near Lamma Island in 2012,2026-01-22 23:57,2026-01-23 00:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200799.htm,"​The Coroner's Court today (January 22) finished reading the verdict on the cause of death of the passengers involved in the vessel collision incident near Lamma Island in 2012.

​A Government spokesman said the Government respects the judgment of the Coroner's Court and would study the verdict carefully with serious follow-up. At the same time, the Government expresses its deepest condolences to the families. After the incident, the Government conducted two investigations, including the one conducted by the Commission of Inquiry (CoI) established in accordance with the Commission of Inquiry Ordinance and the internal investigation led by then-Transport and Housing Bureau (then-THB); and accepted the expert reports under various investigations.

The Transport and Logistics Bureau has all along been supervising the Marine Department (MD) in following up on the recommendations of the CoI and the experts, and in adopting a systemic approach for fully implementing five categories of measures to enhance marine safety and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents. Relevant measures include -


Enhancing safety standards onboard: including requiring all passenger vessels' watertight doors to be fitted with visual and audio alarms; specifying the requirements of watertight door warning markings; improving the labelling and placement of life jackets; and establishing standards for securing seats to the deck;
Improving plan approval and vessel survey standards: including the creation of a dedicated team for plan approval for local vessels; introduction of standardised procedures for vessel surveys and plan approvals; introduction of the tripartite Inspection and Test Plan Scheme (ITP) for high-risk vessels by requiring the shipyard, shipowner and the MD to reach a consensus on important test items and acceptance criteria to clarify any misunderstanding or ambiguity regarding design and regulatory requirements, thus ensuring a vessel's watertight integrity and compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements;
Promoting operational safety within the industry: including the introduction of the common life jacket for use by adults and children; the enactment of the Marine Safety (Alcohol and Drugs) Ordinance to regulate drink and drug boating; and the mandate of lookout arrangements onboard vessels;
​Strengthening industry professionalism and promoting safety culture: including the introduction of the Fast Speed Passenger Vessel Endorsement regime to enhance coxswains' and engine operators' navigational skills and ability to handle emergency situations, as well as the introduction of the Local Safety Management System; and
Introducing systemic reform of the MD's management and regulatory regime: including strengthening professional development of MD officers; launching of the electronic vessel survey system and introducing the use of electronic certificates to enhance work efficiency and quality.


Please refer to the Annex for details of the relevant measures.

As for the responsibilities of the MD officers involved, the then-THB forwarded the internal investigation report (THB Report) to the Civil Service Bureau (CSB) for follow-up, and the CSB has, in accordance with the recommendations in the THB Report and the legal advice from the Department of Justice, took actions according to the disciplinary procedures and finished following up on the relevant cases. There were also two MD officers involved who were criminally prosecuted and sentenced to imprisonment.

特區政府強烈反對歐洲議會的所謂決議,2026-01-22 23:11,2026-01-22 23:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200787.htm,"​香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（一月二十二日）強烈反對歐洲議會通過涉及香港的所謂決議，並就歐洲議會對香港作出無理指控，以及藉黎智英案抹黑《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》（《條例》），予以強烈譴責，以正視聽。

特區政府發言人指出︰「歐洲議會以偏概全、譁眾取寵，對《香港國安法》的重大歷史意義及其對香港特區帶來的積極影響視若無睹，反而扭曲事實、抹黑香港特區和《香港國安法》及特區其他維護國家安全相關法律，但對其他國家政府對危害國家安全的活動嚴厲執法，卻不曾置喙，這全然是卑劣政治操作，必須嚴厲直斥其非，並讓世人看清歐洲議會不顧廉恥的『雙重標準』。」

「此外，歐洲議會沒有尊重特區法庭基於事實和證據就『黎智英案』所作的獨立審判、拒絕正視裁決理由羅列的各項證據、拒絕理解法庭的考慮和裁決理由，就肆意發動攻擊，污衊和攻擊特區政府，完全歪曲事實、顛倒是非，其險惡用心昭然若揭。」

特區維護國家安全法律的正面作用

發言人強調：「國家安全是任何一個國家的頭等大事。每個國家都會制定維護國家安全法律，這既是以《聯合國憲章》為基礎的國際法和國際關係基本準則下，每個主權國家的固有權利，也是國際慣例。歐洲不同國家亦有各自制定其本身的維護國家安全法律。事實上，危害國家安全的行為和活動會引起極其嚴重的後果，必須及時採取行動有效防範和制止，沒有一個國家會對危害國家安全的行為和活動袖手旁觀。任何妄顧事實抹黑香港特區維護國家安全工作的言論都是偽善和不負責任，注定不得人心。」

「過去一段長時間，外部勢力透過其代理人在香港進行滲透破壞活動，更策動二○一九年的『黑暴』和港版『顏色革命』，使『一國兩制』幾乎毀於一旦。《香港國安法》的出台實施，止暴制亂，效果立竿見影，讓香港社會迅速回復穩定；二○二四年，香港特區切實履行憲制責任，在社會廣泛共識下訂立《維護國家安全條例》，完善了特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制，使香港得以從『由亂到治』走向『由治及興』。」

「外部勢力『以港遏華』的圖謀無法得逞，只好抹黑詆毀《香港國安法》。但事實擺在眼前，香港市民和國際投資者的眼睛都是雪亮的。《香港國安法》實施五年多以來，恢復了香港市民在『黑暴』期間無法享有的權利和自由，以及讓廣大香港市民生活和經濟活動迅速回復正常，營商環境得以恢復並不斷提升。根據《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港的排名躍升兩位至全球第三；香港在全球國際金融中心中位列三甲。這些國際認可的成就都是建基於《香港國安法》及其他特區相關法律和維護國家安全工作為香港社會帶來的自由、安穩。」

法庭就「黎智英案」的定罪裁決絕無任何政治考慮

「法庭就『黎智英案』頒下的裁決理由長達855頁，完全公開供公眾查閱，鉅細無遺地說明法庭對相關法律原則和證據的分析，以及裁定黎智英和三間被告公司有罪的理由。法庭在裁決理由中清楚表明，黎智英並非因其政治觀點或信念受審。法庭的定罪裁決有理有節，充分展現法庭嚴格依照法律和證據作出裁決，不受任何干涉，更絕無任何政治考慮。」

發言人強調：「香港特區是法治社會，一直秉持有法必依、違法必究的原則。《香港國安法》第五條和《維護國家安全條例》第2條明確訂明防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪，應當堅持法治原則。倡議某種背景的人或組織不應就其違法行為和活動受到法律制裁，等同給予其犯法特權，完全違反法治精神。」

「黎智英案」與新聞自由完全無關

發言人再三重申：「『黎智英案』與新聞自由完全無關，各被告多年來是利用新聞報道為幌子，行禍國害港之實。黎智英根本就是一系列反中亂港事件的背後推手，是切切實實外部反華勢力的代理人。本案公開審訊中，揭示了黎智英密切管理和親自控制《蘋果日報》的編採方向，其中一名高層人員甚至稱之為『鳥籠』自主。」

「香港市民擁有《基本法》及《香港人權法案》所保障的新聞及言論自由。事實上，《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》均明確規定，維護國家安全必須尊重及保障人權，並依法保障香港居民根據《基本法》、《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》及《經濟、社會與文化權利國際公約》適用於香港特區的權利與自由，包括新聞、言論及出版等自由。與世界其他地區一樣，新聞從業員與其他市民一樣，有義務遵守所有法律。根據《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》第十九條、《歐洲人權公約》以及相關判例確立的原則，傳媒及新聞從業員在發表言論、資訊及文章時，須承擔『特別責任和義務』，包括保障國家安全及公共秩序；新聞從業員必須按『負責任新聞作業』原則真誠地行事，以準確事實為基礎，並提供準確可靠的資訊，方可獲言論和新聞自由的保障。」

黎智英的健康受到適切照顧

發言人表示：「懲教署在處理黎智英的羈押安排時，跟其他在囚人士一視同仁。懲教署一直極為重視在囚人士的安全及健康。不論在囚人士的身分、年齡和國籍，署方一直致力為其提供安全、人道、合適和健康的羈管環境，包括提供合適和及時的醫療支援。」

「黎智英在羈押期間所獲得的醫療服務是完備的。所有懲教院所都設有醫院或診療室，由衞生署派駐的醫生和擁有護理資格的懲教人員提供24小時的醫療服務。醫院管理局與衞生署所屬的專科醫生會定期到訪有關院所，為在囚人士提供專科診症和治療服務。假如情況嚴重，在囚人士會被立刻轉送到公立醫院治理。」

「在二○二五年八月的公開法庭聆訊中，代表黎智英的資深大律師已向法庭清楚表明，黎智英在獄中一直獲得適切的治療和待遇，懲教院所為黎智英每日安排醫療檢查，且對黎智英在懲教院所內獲得的醫療服務沒有任何投訴，法官表示懲教署值得稱讚。於一月十二日的法庭公開聆訊中，代表黎智英的資深大律師確認黎智英就他的羈押安排沒有任何投訴。」

發言人指出：「任何借本案炒作詆毀香港特區法治和人權狀況的人，都是歪曲事實、毫無誠信之徒。特區政府強烈呼籲歐洲議會及早認清事實，回頭是岸。特區政府將繼續堅定不移全面準確實施《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》及香港特區其他維護國家安全的相關法律，依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，同時依法保障香港市民的權利和自由，確保『一國兩制』實踐行穩致遠。」"
政府回應二○一二年南丫島附近撞船事故死因研訊判辭,2026-01-22 22:39,2026-01-22 22:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200757.htm,"死因裁判法庭（死因庭）今日（一月二十二日）完成宣讀二○一二年南丫島附近撞船事故（事故）罹難者死因裁決。

政府發言人表示尊重死因庭裁決，並會仔細研究和認真跟進判辭，同時向死者家屬致以最深切的慰問。事故發生以來，政府對事故進行了兩項調查，包括由根據《調查委員會條例》成立的事故調查委員會所作的調查和由前運輸及房屋局領導進行的內部調查，以及接納了各項調查的專家報告。

局方一直督促海事處努力跟進調查委員會及專家提出的建議，並採取系統性方針，全面落實五大類措施，以加強保障海上安全，避免類似事故發生。相關措施包括：

（一）提升船上安全規範：包括規定所有載客船隻的水密門須裝設警報器、規定水密門標示的要求、改善救生衣標示和放置位置，以及訂明座椅固定於甲板的標準等；

（二）提升圖則審批和驗船水平：包括就本地船隻增設專責圖則審批小組；引入標準化驗船及圖則審批程式，以及實施建造高風險船隻質保計劃（ITP），規定船廠、船東與海事處三方在建造高風險船隻前，須就重要測試項目及相應的驗收準則達成共識，以釐清在設計及規管要求上的誤解或不明之處，確保全船水密性和符合規管與合約要求；

（三）提升業界運作安全：包括推出成人和兒童兩用救生衣、制訂《海上安全（酒精及藥物）條例》來規管海上醉駕和藥駕行為，以及強制規定船上瞭望安排等；

（四）加強業界專業水平及安全文化：包括推出快速客船批註，以提升相關船隻上船長和輪機操作員的航行操作及緊急應變能力，以及引入本地船舶安全管理系統等；以及

（五）系統性改革海事處管理及監管制度：包括加強海事處職員的專業培訓、推出電子驗船系統，以及實施電子證書等，以提升工作效率和質素。

​相關措施的詳情見附件。

至於涉事海事處職員的責任，前運輸及房屋局已於二○一四年四月把內部調查報告（運房局報告）轉交公務員事務局跟進，而公務員事務局已按前運房局報告的建議和律政司的相關法律意見，根據紀律程序採取行動並完成跟進相關個案。另有兩名涉事海事處職員刑事罪名成立，被判入獄。

針對死因裁判官給予海事處的建議，包括（一）與船廠、海上運輸服務營運商及相關專業團體定期接觸，或透過發出簡易指引或澄清，以確保他們了解相關規例的實施方法；（二）實施新制度，要求船東在定期驗船前確認在上次驗船後沒有被改裝；（三）繼續檢視海員的工時和休息安排，尤其專注於查找日常運作上的疲勞風險，而過程中應諮詢主要渡輪服務營運商，以及應繼續利用本地船隻諮詢委員會的平台作相關討論；以及（四）向業界發放死因裁判官給予財利船廠的建議資訊，海事處將認真研究跟進。就第一項建議，海事處一直加強與業界溝通，並已實施本地安全管理系統，以主動風險管理的方針，加強與業界就海上安全相關事宜上的溝通；有關第二項建議，海事處正積極籌備在目前驗船制度下，要求船東在驗船前確定船舶沒有作未獲允許的改裝；就第三項建議，政府會檢視本地船隻海員的工作環境及情況，並會充分諮詢相關持份者的意見；就第四項建議，海事處會就此與其他船廠聯繫。

發言人表示，政府將繼續與業界攜手合作，協力提升海上安全。"

尊敬的蔣作君主席（全國政協副主席、致公黨中央主席）、劉光源副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、王錦輝會長（香港僑友社會長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今天是香港僑友社成立四十四周年暨第十九屆理監事會的就職典禮。首先，我祝賀僑友社的新一屆理監事工作順利。

四十四載春華秋實。香港僑友社自一九八二年成立以來，一直秉持愛國、愛港、愛鄉、愛僑的宗旨，凝聚在港僑胞的力量。僑友社在鼓勵僑胞推動家鄉發展的同時，積極參與香港社會事務，促進香港繁榮穩定，我肯定僑友社多年來的貢獻。

二十屆四中全會審議通過的國家「十五五」規劃建議，支持香港更好融入和服務國家發展大局，發揮香港背靠祖國、聯通世界獨特優勢和重要作用，鞏固提升香港國際金融、航運、貿易中心地位，支持香港建設國際創新科技中心、打造國際高端人才集聚高地。

今年是國家「十五五」規劃的開局之年，也是特區政府進一步深化改革、全力拼經濟、謀發展、搞建設、惠民生的一年。

香港會繼續發揮「一國兩制」下內聯外通的優勢，主動對接國家「十五五」規劃，深化國際交往合作，更好融入和服務國家發展大局。我們也會擔當好「超級聯繫人」及「超級增值人」的角色，持續鞏固提升自身優勢，加速發展新增長點，為香港注入源源不絕的發展動能。

遍布全球的華僑社群，擁有開闊的視野和廣泛的網絡，是國家和香港聯繫世界的重要力量。我鼓勵香港僑友社和各位僑胞，在各自的崗位上繼續發揮所長，當好中華文化與世界各地文化交流的橋樑，向世界說好中國故事、說好香港故事。

我相信僑友社在新一屆理監事帶領下，會繼續與特區政府攜手並肩，積極凝聚僑界更大力量，推動國家和香港的高質量發展，為中華民族偉大復興譜寫更輝煌的新篇章。

最後，我祝願香港僑友社竿頭日進，在座各位在新一年四季平安，謝謝大家。"
Speech by CE at Hong Kong Academy of Sciences 10th Anniversary Celebration Banquet (English only),2026-01-22 19:50,2026-01-22 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200660.htm,"Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences 10th Anniversary Celebration Banquet today (January 22):

Professor Dennis Lo (President of the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences), members of the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences and the Hong Kong Young Academy of Sciences, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. It is an honour to join you tonight, in celebration of the landmark 10th anniversary of the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences.

Over the past decade, the Academy has played a pivotal role in bringing together leading scientists, locally and internationally. No less important, it has nurtured promising young science and technology talent, inspiring scientific and technological excellence in Hong Kong. The Academy has also been the Government's close partner in developing Hong Kong's innovation and technology (I&T) sector.

I&T is shaping the future of our generation and our world. And the Government is committed to ensuring Hong Kong's rise as an international I&T centre.

I'm glad to tell you that we're making notable progress. To quote a few figures, our gross expenditure on research and development in 2024 was more than double that of 2014, ten years ago, rising from 16billion Hong Kong Dollars in 2014 to about 36 billion Hong Kong Dollars in 2024. The number of employees in the I&T sector has also surged 70 per cent, from 35 000 to about 59 000, over the same period.

During that time, we witnessed the birth of 20 unicorn companies in Hong Kong. At last count, we are home to a thriving community of some 4 700 start-ups. And I have confidence that these figures will be on the rise, as we continue to attract quality I&T talent, companies and start-ups to Hong Kong.

And we're certainly not slowing down. Among many other initiatives, we launched the 3 billion Hong Kong Dollars Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme last September. The funding will help our universities attract leading scientists and researchers to Hong Kong.

Last year, for the first time, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster ranked first, number one, among the world's top 100 innovation clusters, in the annual Global Innovation Index.

Also last year, Hong Kong ranked fourth, globally, in the World Digital Competitiveness Ranking published by the International Institute for Management Development. That's up three places from the previous year. In the areas of ""technological framework"" and ""adaptive attitudes"", we came first globally.

More than topping international rankings, our development into an international I&T centre tops the HKSAR Government's policy agenda. In this, we enjoy the firm support of the National 14th Five-Year Plan, as well as the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development. 

We are, let me add, expediting development across the entire I&T spectrum, which include:


consolidating our upstream strengths in basic research;
promoting the midstream transformation and commercialisation of research outcomes; and
encouraging downstream industry development.


This wide-ranging, far-reaching approach is opening up fresh opportunities, particularly under our new South-North dual engine, which pairs finance in the south and I&T in the north. Hong Kong Park in the Loop and San Tin Technopole, both located in our fast-growing Northern Metropolis, are the strategy's central pillars.

Together, they will drive emerging technology industries in Hong Kong, and serve as a critical centre for developing new quality productive forces.

Hong Kong Park in the Loop officially opened last month. That marked a milestone in the development of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, an area that straddles our boundary with Shenzhen.

The 210 hectares of new I&T land in the San Tin area is a natural extension of the Loop. And our publication, last November, of the conceptual outline of San Tin Technopole's development plan for the I&T industry, sets a clear strategy for San Tin Technopole.

The San Tin area's I&T sites are expected to integrate with the industry supply chains of cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. And the land will accommodate the varying scales and technology fields of their companies.

We expect it will also take up the transformation and industrialisation of Hong Kong Park's research outcomes. That will certainly drive economic growth, creating high-quality employment opportunities and industrial upgrading.

Together, the new I&T land surrounding San Tin and Hong Kong Park will form a crucial node for the integrated emergence of upstream, midstream and downstream I&T industries. They will help propel Hong Kong's development as an I&T powerhouse, radiating with influence that transcends boundaries.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is just the beginning. Thanks to the unwavering support of our country, the Northern Metropolis' fast-track development, and the continuing contributions of key partners such as the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences, I am confident that Hong Kong's science and I&T sectors will be at the heart of our city's flourishing future.

My thanks, once again, to the Academy of Sciences for its dedication, perseverance and countless contributions over its first eventful decade. I look forward to the Academy's next 10 years of scientific promise and great progress.

Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you all a very memorable evening and a happy, healthy and prosperous new year. Thank you."

Good evening. It is an honour to join you tonight, in celebration of the landmark 10th anniversary of the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences.

Over the past decade, the Academy has played a pivotal role in bringing together leading scientists, locally and internationally. No less important, it has nurtured promising young science and technology talent, inspiring scientific and technological excellence in Hong Kong. The Academy has also been the Government's close partner in developing Hong Kong's innovation and technology (I&T) sector.

I&T is shaping the future of our generation and our world. And the Government is committed to ensuring Hong Kong's rise as an international I&T centre.

I'm glad to tell you that we're making notable progress. To quote a few figures, our gross expenditure on research and development in 2024 was more than double that of 2014, ten years ago, rising from 16billion Hong Kong Dollars in 2014 to about 36 billion Hong Kong Dollars in 2024. The number of employees in the I&T sector has also surged 70 per cent, from 35 000 to about 59 000, over the same period.

During that time, we witnessed the birth of 20 unicorn companies in Hong Kong. At last count, we are home to a thriving community of some 4 700 start-ups. And I have confidence that these figures will be on the rise, as we continue to attract quality I&T talent, companies and start-ups to Hong Kong.

And we're certainly not slowing down. Among many other initiatives, we launched the 3 billion Hong Kong Dollars Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme last September. The funding will help our universities attract leading scientists and researchers to Hong Kong.

Last year, for the first time, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster ranked first, number one, among the world's top 100 innovation clusters, in the annual Global Innovation Index.

Also last year, Hong Kong ranked fourth, globally, in the World Digital Competitiveness Ranking published by the International Institute for Management Development. That's up three places from the previous year. In the areas of ""technological framework"" and ""adaptive attitudes"", we came first globally.

More than topping international rankings, our development into an international I&T centre tops the HKSAR Government's policy agenda. In this, we enjoy the firm support of the National 14th Five-Year Plan, as well as the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development. 

We are, let me add, expediting development across the entire I&T spectrum, which include:


consolidating our upstream strengths in basic research;
promoting the midstream transformation and commercialisation of research outcomes; and
encouraging downstream industry development.


This wide-ranging, far-reaching approach is opening up fresh opportunities, particularly under our new South-North dual engine, which pairs finance in the south and I&T in the north. Hong Kong Park in the Loop and San Tin Technopole, both located in our fast-growing Northern Metropolis, are the strategy's central pillars.

Together, they will drive emerging technology industries in Hong Kong, and serve as a critical centre for developing new quality productive forces.

Hong Kong Park in the Loop officially opened last month. That marked a milestone in the development of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, an area that straddles our boundary with Shenzhen.

The 210 hectares of new I&T land in the San Tin area is a natural extension of the Loop. And our publication, last November, of the conceptual outline of San Tin Technopole's development plan for the I&T industry, sets a clear strategy for San Tin Technopole.

The San Tin area's I&T sites are expected to integrate with the industry supply chains of cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. And the land will accommodate the varying scales and technology fields of their companies.

We expect it will also take up the transformation and industrialisation of Hong Kong Park's research outcomes. That will certainly drive economic growth, creating high-quality employment opportunities and industrial upgrading.

Together, the new I&T land surrounding San Tin and Hong Kong Park will form a crucial node for the integrated emergence of upstream, midstream and downstream I&T industries. They will help propel Hong Kong's development as an I&T powerhouse, radiating with influence that transcends boundaries.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is just the beginning. Thanks to the unwavering support of our country, the Northern Metropolis' fast-track development, and the continuing contributions of key partners such as the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences, I am confident that Hong Kong's science and I&T sectors will be at the heart of our city's flourishing future.

My thanks, once again, to the Academy of Sciences for its dedication, perseverance and countless contributions over its first eventful decade. I look forward to the Academy's next 10 years of scientific promise and great progress.

Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you all a very memorable evening and a happy, healthy and prosperous new year. Thank you."

Steering Committee on District Governance convenes sixth meeting (with photo),2026-01-22 19:35,2026-01-22 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200615.htm," The Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, chaired the sixth meeting of the Steering Committee on District Governance today (January 22) to steer and direct various bureaux and departments in formulating strategies on issues of district concern and to follow up on the implementation progress of the 12 key district initiatives identified at the first five meetings.

  Mr Chan said, ""Since their establishment, the Steering Committee and the Task Force on District Governance have adhered to people-oriented principles, and have actively responded to people's livelihood concerns by formulating and implementing a series of clearly targeted, pragmatic and forward-looking policy measures to create a better community environment and enhance people's well-being. In the new year, the Steering Committee will continue to steer bureaux and departments to perform their duties with responsibility and determination, and ensure each people-oriented initiative is fully and effectively implemented.""

  At the meeting, the Steering Committee followed up on the work progress of 12 district issues of public concern (Note) identified at previous meetings, and provided directives to relevant bureaux and departments in a wide range of areas covering support for children and the elderly, community facilities, and environmental hygiene improvements, all aimed at enhancing people’s quality of life.

  In terms of support for parents, 202 primary schools with more than 9 600 students have participated in the School-based After School Care Service Scheme (the Scheme). Participating parents generally recognised that the Scheme has helped support their employment and childcare needs. The Government will continue to encourage more schools to join the Scheme, providing better support for families in need of care services.

  As regards care for the elderly, in order to promote digital inclusion, the Digital Policy Office (DPO) has launched the ""Smart Silver"" Digital Inclusion Programme for Elders (the Programme) since December 2024, providing funding support to 12 district organisations to set up 40 community-based help desks across all 18 districts. These help desks provide training on digital technologies and technical support for elderly people aged 60 or above, particularly singleton or doubleton elders living in old districts and public housing. From launch to December last year, the Programme has already served over 100 000 elderly people. The DPO will continue to assist elderly people in learning about and using smartphones and other digital communication technologies through the Programme, thereby helping them integrate into the community.

  In terms of environmental hygiene, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to carry out rodent control actions in 93 major rodent black spots, and has achieved the target of reducing the number of black spots by 60 percent before the end of 2025. The FEHD will continue the efforts to foster clean markets and improve the community environment through publicity and education, enforcement actions and enhanced daily cleaning. In regard to combating water dripping from air-conditioners in buildings, the FEHD will build on the experience gained last summer to study the application of AI image recognition technology to automatically detect dripping sources, and will strengthen collaboration with the property management sector to tackle the problem of dripping air conditioners and improve the living environment for the public.

  In accordance with the overall strategies set by the Steering Committee on District Governance, the Task Force on District Governance, chaired by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, will continue to co-ordinate bureaux and departments in taking forward the various district initiatives to raise people’s standard of living with concrete results and enhance their sense of achievement, satisfaction and security.

Note: The 12 district issues are (1) expanding after-school care services and enhancing support for parents; (2) caring for the elderly and enhancing community support; (3) fostering clean markets and mobilising the community to participate in anti-rodent work; (4) enhancing public order and combating crimes on all fronts; (5) improving pedestrian facilities and ensuring road safety; (6) enhancing the community environment and strengthening local characteristics; (7) improving the environment of public housing estates and creating comfortable homes; (8) caring for the elderly and promoting digital inclusion; (9) improving the waiting environment at public transport interchanges to enhance the travel experience of people; (10) combating water dripping from air-conditioners in buildings to improve the community environment; (11) cleaning pedestrian walkways to improve the cityscape; and (12) strengthening thematic plantings."

Speech by DSJ at closing ceremony of second edition of Hong Kong Common Law Practical Training Course (English only),2026-01-22 19:10,2026-01-22 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200599.htm,"  Following are the closing remarks by the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, at the closing ceremony of the second edition of the Hong Kong Common Law Practical Training Course - Company Law in Focus today (January 22):

Deputy Director Si (Deputy Director General of the Research Office of the Supreme People's Court, Ms Si Yanli), distinguished judges, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good afternoon. It is my pleasure to deliver the closing remarks for the Hong Kong Common Law Practical Training Course - Company Law in Focus, which has brought together 24 senior judges representing 22 courts across the Chinese Mainland, including the Supreme People's Court, as well as courts from 12 provinces and 3 direct-administered municipalities. Such unprecedented composition of judges reflects the breadth and depth of collaboration between Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland in the area of judicial capacity building, and marks a new milestone in our ongoing endeavour to enhance mutual understanding and co-operation between our two legal systems. I am both humbled and honoured to witness this important achievement.

 I am also delighted to note that this Training Course focusing on company law is complementary to other key initiatives undertaken by my Department. As announced in the Policy Address 2025, I have been tasked by the Chief Executive to promote Hong Kong's legal services and collaborate with other professional sectors, including accounting and finance, to support Chinese Mainland enterprises aspiring to expand their businesses overseas. In this connection, the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy, with the support of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, successfully organised the Legal Practical Training Course for Chinese Enterprises Going Overseas last October. That course provides training for over 30 general counsel and legal advisors from companies on the Chinese Mainland, and this Training Course provides training on the company law for judges on the Chinese Mainland.

 I must take this opportunity to show appreciation to all those involved in making this Training Course a real success. First and foremost, on behalf of the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy, I would like to extend our profound gratitude to the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China for its unwavering support. We are particularly grateful to Director General Si and her team for their invaluable guidance throughout this course. From the early stages of course planning and content design, through the nomination of participants, to the close co-ordination during the Training Course, the Supreme People's Court has provided tremendous support to the Academy, which has been instrumental in making this second edition of the Hong Kong Common Law Practical Training Course a success.

 Second, I would like to thank all our distinguished speakers and moderators, who delivered nothing short of excellence despite their demanding schedules. Their interactive sessions have engaged participants in discussing real-world issues, turning classroom learning into an interactive judicial dialogue. Their willingness and dedication to share their valuable knowledge and practical experience have made this Course truly impactful.

 Third, I wish to offer my warmest congratulations and appreciation to all of you for your active participation throughout the course. Each question raised, each comment shared, and each perspective offered brought new dimensions to our collective learning. There is a Chinese saying, ""教學相長"", that is teaching and learning advance hand in hand. This principle has truly come to life throughout this course. Your insights and contributions have deepened our understanding of cross-border judicial practice, demonstrating how the Hong Kong common law principles could be applied in civil law adjudication in foreign-related cases. This dynamic, two-way exchange of knowledge is what makes this course truly meaningful and enriching for both participants and speakers.

 I am grateful for the heartfelt sharing from some of you just now about your experiences throughout this course. Knowing the course has equipped you to address the real challenges in handling foreign-related cases back home brings great encouragement to me and my colleagues. It is most rewarding to learn that the course has met, and even exceeded, your expectations. We are also glad that you have known more about Hong Kong's unique legal system and way of life, while building lasting friendships with fellow distinguished judges from across the country. I hope that you will carry these valuable insights and new connections forward into your future professional endeavours.

 Looking forward, the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy will continue to collaborate with the Supreme People's Court to organise judicial capacity-building programmes to foster the knowledge exchange between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong. We will also continue to explore collaboration with provincial courts for judicial capacity building as well. For example, the Academy co-organised with the Shanghai High People's Court a training course in Shanghai in November last year for around 100 judges in the Yangtze River Delta region. The training course focused on practical difficulties in foreign-related adjudication, including the characteristics of Hong Kong's common law under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, its comparison and interaction with the law on the Chinese Mainland, and practical issues such as contract law, law of evidence, judicial reviews of arbitration, ascertainment of foreign law and drafting of judgments. We hope these initiatives will support the national strategy to be outlined in the 15th Five-Year Plan to strengthen judicial capability and promote the rule of law. We look forward with great anticipation to many more similar courses in Hong Kong and on the Chinese Mainland in the years to come.

 Distinguished judges, thank you once again for your invaluable contribution and participation. To enable us to develop even more impactful training programmes ahead, I encourage you to take a few minutes to complete the feedback form and share your views - whether on the structure of sessions, the balance between lectures and visits, or the inclusion of specific topics. Lastly, may I wish you a safe journey back home, and a joyful and prosperous Chinese New Year ahead. Thank you very much."

Four incoming passengers convicted and jailed for importing and dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2026-01-22 18:42,2026-01-22 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200584.htm,"Four incoming passengers were sentenced from four months' to seven months' imprisonment, and three of them were fined $500, by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (January 22) for importing and dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes, failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted a 48-year-old incoming female passenger, a 37-year-old incoming male passenger and a 55-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on November 26, 2025. About 98 600 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $404,000 and a duty potential of about $326,000 in total, were seized from their baggage. They were subsequently arrested.

The three passengers were each sentenced to seven months' imprisonment and fined $500 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today.

In addition, Customs officers intercepted a 33-year-old incoming male passenger at the airport on January 21 and seized 28 400 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $127,800 and a duty potential of about $93,800 from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to four months' imprisonment by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today.

Customs welcomes the sentences. The custodial sentences impose a considerable deterrent effect and reflect the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

海關人員於二○二五年十一月二十六日在香港國際機場截查一名四十八歲抵港女旅客、一名三十七歲抵港男旅客和一名五十五歲抵港男旅客，並在他們的行李內共檢獲約九萬八千六百支未完稅香煙，市值共約四十萬四千元，應課稅值總共約三十二萬六千元。該三名抵港旅客隨即被捕。

​該三名旅客今日在西九龍裁判法院各被判處監禁七個月及罰款五百元。

此外，海關人員於一月二十一日在機場截查一名三十三歲抵港男旅客，並在他攜帶的個人行李內共檢獲約二萬八千四百支未完稅香煙，市值共約十二萬七千八百元，應課稅值總共約九萬三千八百元。該名抵港旅客隨即被捕。他今日在西九龍裁判法院被判處監禁四個月。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Under the theme “Honouring the Past, Shaping the Future of Negotiation”, the event focuses on innovation, capacity building, and experience sharing. It brings together local, Chinese Mainland and overseas experts and practitioners to share insights through keynote speeches and panel discussions, fostering exchanges and exploring future directions.

Speaking at the opening ceremony, the Commissioner of Police, Mr Chow Yat-ming, stated that since its establishment in 1975, the Police Negotiation Cadre (PNC) has provided round-the-clock support on a secondary duty basis. Initially tasked with handling counter-terrorism and serious crime cases, the PNC later expanded its duties to include suicide intervention. In recent years, it has actively collaborated with stakeholders from different sectors, including the Education Bureau, the Hospital Authority, as well as the education and social welfare sectors, to strengthen schools’ capability in handling crises and promote psychological resilience among students. The PNC also shoulders the important mission of safeguarding national security, ensuring the harmony and stability of Hong Kong.

Mr Chow added that with over 100 members, the PNC has consistently upheld the motto “Who Cares Wins” and has successfully resolved crises and saved lives through calm analysis, active listening, and strong teamwork. He expressed his gratitude to the PNC members over the years for their selfless dedication and efforts, and to the various units for their support. He hoped that the symposium would facilitate in-depth exchanges and foster collaboration among all parties to move forward together.

The symposium has invited over 500 representatives engaged in negotiation and crisis management from Chinese Mainland, Cambodia, Dubai, Indonesia, Macau, Singapore, and Switzerland, as well as local representatives from the education and social welfare sectors.

The first day of the symposium focused on sharing local and overseas experience in crisis management, negotiation, and solutions. The PNC, together with representatives from Mainland public security authorities and the international negotiation community, explored co-operation in crisis management and exchanged views on strengthening public safety and enhancing community resilience through negotiation work. These discussions strengthened international and regional partnerships and chart a forward‑looking roadmap for negotiation development in Hong Kong. The symposium tomorrow will engage local professional groups and academia in exploring the development of school support networks, the prevention of youth suicides, and the role of artificial intelligence in the course of negotiation.

Also held at the venue was the PNC 50th Anniversary Commemorative Exhibition, showcasing the contributions of the PNC in saving lives and maintaining social stability through historical photographs, memorabilia and significant negotiation cases. Looking ahead, the PNC will continue to work hand in hand with local, Chinese Mainland and international partners to resolve crises through dialogue, striving to ensure Hong Kong remains one of the safest and most stable cities in the world."

一月份第三批涵蓋14個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及八個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二六年一月共三批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共38個監察地區，當中大部分地區更為0%，顯示白紋伊蚊的分布情況並不廣泛。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自二○二五年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。食環署檢討現行登革熱／基孔肯雅熱病媒監察計劃後，由二○二六起擴大監察白紋伊蚊的覆蓋範圍，把在社區設置的監察地區修訂為62個，個別監察地區會重新命名，在全港不同地點亦會增設誘蚊器，以加強監察蚊子的滋生情況。按現行監察機制，食環署在各社區的監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。在監察期間，食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Among the third batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 14 survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering eight survey areas in January, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released three batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in January 2026, covering 38 survey areas; most of the areas recorded 0 per cent, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive.

The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August 2025, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever (DF). After reviewing the present DF and CF vector surveillance programme, the FEHD has expanded the coverage for monitoring Aedes albopictus mosquitoes starting from 2026. The number of survey areas set up in the community has been revised to 62, with some survey areas renamed. Additional gravidtraps will also be set up at different locations across the territory to strengthen the monitoring of the breeding of mosquitoes. Under the present surveillance mechanism, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in survey areas of the community, with a surveillance period of two weeks. During the surveillance period, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."
Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-22 17:30,2026-01-22 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200511.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 22), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-22 17:30,2026-01-22 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200512.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月二十二日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。


繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。
​
市民應採取的防預措施

展望將來，由於本地成本及外圍價格壓力仍然溫和，整體通脹短期內應保持輕微。

Consumer Price Indices for December 2025,2026-01-22 16:30,2026-01-22 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200447.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (January 22) the Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for December 2025. According to the Composite CPI, overall consumer prices rose by 1.4% in December 2025 over the same month a year earlier, larger than the corresponding increase (1.2%) in November 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rate of increase in the Composite CPI (i.e. the underlying inflation rate) in December 2025 was 1.2%, also larger than that in November 2025 (1.0%). The larger increase was mainly due to the increases in the charges for package tours as well as inbound and outbound transport fares.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, the average monthly rate of increase in the Composite CPI for the 3-month period ending December 2025 was 0.2%, and that for the 3-month period ending November 2025 was 0.1%. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the corresponding rates of increase were 0.2% and 0.1%.

  Analysed by sub-index, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.5%, 1.3% and 1.4% respectively in December 2025, as compared to 1.5%, 1.1% and 1.1% respectively in November 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.0%, 1.2% and 1.4% respectively in December 2025, as compared to 0.9%, 1.0% and 1.1% respectively in November 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, for the 3-month period ending December 2025, the average monthly rates of change in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. The corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending November 2025 were 0.0%, 0.1% and 0.1% respectively. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the average monthly rates of change in the seasonally adjusted CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) for the 3-month period ending December 2025 were 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3% respectively, and the corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending November 2025 were 0.0%, 0.1% and 0.1% respectively.

  Amongst the various components of the Composite CPI, year-on-year increases in prices were recorded in December 2025 for transport (4.3%), miscellaneous services (2.3%), alcoholic drinks and tobacco (2.0%), housing (1.6%), miscellaneous goods (1.2%), meals out and takeaway food (1.1%), and basic food (0.7%).

  On the other hand, year-on-year decreases in the components of the Composite CPI were recorded in December 2025 for durable goods (-2.6%), clothing and footwear (-1.7%), and electricity, gas and water (-1.6%).

  In the fourth quarter of 2025, the Composite CPI rose by 1.3% over a year earlier, while the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) rose by 1.4%, 1.2% and 1.2% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.1%, 1.0%, 1.1% and 1.2% respectively.

  For 2025 as a whole, the Composite CPI was 1.4% higher than that in the preceding year. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.9%, 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.1%, 1.3%, 1.0% and 1.0% respectively.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that consumer price inflation stayed modest in December 2025. The underlying Composite CPI increased by 1.2% in the month over a year earlier, giving an annual increase of 1.1% for 2025 as a whole, same as the preceding year. Price pressures on various major components remained generally contained.

  Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay modest in the near term, as domestic cost and external price pressures are still mild.
