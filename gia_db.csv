Public and visitors urged to plan cross-boundary trips early for Chung Yeung Festival holiday,2025-10-27 17:54,2025-10-27 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700524.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (October 27) said that, in anticipation of a large number of members of the public, vehicles and Mainland visitors travelling between Hong Kong and the Mainland or Macao via various land-based boundary control points (BCPs) during the Chung Yeung Festival holiday (October 29), the public and visitors are urged to plan their trips early and allow sufficient travelling time.

  The TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators (PTOs) to strengthen their services on that day, including:


Increasing the frequency of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) shuttle bus (Gold Bus) to an average of about one minute during peak hours, if needed;
Increasing the frequency of the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) to an average of about two minutes during peak hours, if needed;
Increasing the quota of cross-boundary coaches to strengthen services;
The frequency of local franchised bus B routes connecting various land-based BCPs will also be increased to a level higher than that of normal weekends, and the operators concerned will reserve sufficient vehicles and manpower to meet passenger demand; and
The MTR Corporation Limited will enhance the train services of the East Rail Line between Admiralty and Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau at different times on that day to provide convenience for the travelling public and visitors.


  It is anticipated that the waiting time for public transport services including the Gold Bus and the franchised bus B routes may be longer. Passengers should make their journeys during non-peak hours, observe order while queuing and heed advice from on-site Police and staff of PTOs concerned. Passengers of cross-boundary coaches are also advised to reserve their coach tickets in advance.

  Of note, motorists are advised that, subject to actual traffic conditions, special traffic arrangements may be implemented at the Lok Ma Chau Control Point and the Shenzhen Bay Port on that day to allow smooth access for public transport vehicles to the above control points. Cross-boundary private cars may need to queue up for crossing the BCPs. Motorists should pay extra attention to variable message signs and traffic signs along the roads. In case of traffic congestion, they should remain patient and follow the instructions of on-site Police.

  For the HZMB, to plan their journeys ahead, members of the public can make use of the TD's HKeMobility mobile app or website (hkemobility.gov.hk/en/traffic-information/live/cctv) to access snapshots of traffic conditions at inbound and outbound vehicle plazas of the HZMB Hong Kong Port. They can also check real-time situations of the vehicle clearance plaza of the Zhuhai Port through the WeChat official accounts ""hzmbzhport"" or ""zhuhaifabu"" (traffic-info.gzazhka.com:5015/#/) (Chinese only). Moreover, motorists are reminded to always comply with the traffic control measures implemented by the Zhuhai authority when driving on the HZMB Main Bridge. Vehicles shall not occupy the emergency lane unless instructed by the Zhuhai authority.

  The public and visitors may visit the one-stop information platform on immigration clearance ""Easy Boundary"" (www.sb.gov.hk/eng/bwt/status.html?type=outbound) launched by the Security Bureau or the TD's HKeMobility mobile app for the latest information on various land-based BCPs more conveniently. The TD will provide information on the service and waiting time of the Gold Bus, the Yellow Bus and MTR on the platform. Members of the public are advised to check the latest traffic news through radio and television broadcasts, the TD's website and the HKeMobility."

衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-10-27 16:45,2025-10-27 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700494.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（十月二十七日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在十月十九日至二十五日期間，衞生防護中心錄得三宗社區感染的退伍軍人病個案。詳情如下：


83歲女病人，有長期病患，居於東區；
54歲男病人，過往健康良好，居於元朗區；及
75歲男病人，有長期病患，居於東區。


衞生防護中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這三宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至十月二十五日，今年錄得135宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及
避免在通風較差的環境工作，如密封的溫室。


市民可參閱衞生防護中心退伍軍人病專頁、預防退伍軍人病委員會「預防退伍軍人病工作守則」及「適用於樓宇管理的冷熱水系統內務管理指引」；及衞生防護中心防控退伍軍人病的風險為本策略。"
DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-10-27 16:45,2025-10-27 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700495.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (October 27) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From October 19 to 25, the CHP recorded three community-acquired LD cases. The details of the cases are as follows:


an 83-year-old female patient with underlying illnesses living in Eastern District;
a 54-year-old male patient with good past health living in Yuen Long District; and
a 75-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Eastern District.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that these are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these three cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of October 25, 135 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.

â
âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

繼二零二五年八月份錄得14.5%的按年升幅後，二零二五年九月份商品整體出口貨值為4,623億元，較二零二四年同月上升16.1%。同時，繼二零二五年八月份錄得11.5%的按年升幅後，二零二五年九月份商品進口貨值為5,125億元，較二零二四年同月上升13.6%。二零二五年九月份錄得有形貿易逆差502億元，相等於商品進口貨值的9.8%。

二零二五年首九個月的商品整體出口貨值較二零二四年同期上升13.4%。同時，商品進口貨值上升13.1%。二零二五年首九個月錄得有形貿易逆差2,939億元，相等於商品進口貨值的7.2%。

經季節性調整的數字顯示，二零二五年第三季與對上一季比較，商品整體出口貨值下跌0.7%。同時，商品進口貨值大致維持不變。

按國家／地區分析

二零二五年九月份與二零二四年同月比較，輸往亞洲的整體出口貨值上升18.3%。此地區內，輸往大部分主要目的地的整體出口貨值錄得升幅，尤其是越南（升50.9%）、馬來西亞（升40.0%）、台灣（升31.9%）、印度（升19.5%）和中國內地（內地）（升16.7%）。

除亞洲的目的地外，輸往其他地區的部分主要目的地的整體出口貨值錄得升幅，尤其是瑞士（升138.5%）和德國（升27.6%）。

同期，來自大部分主要供應地的進口貨值錄得升幅，尤其是英國（升70.3%）、越南（升68.7%）、新加坡（升33.2%）、內地（升19.4%）和日本（升12.9%）。另一方面，來自台灣（跌19.0%）的進口貨值則錄得跌幅。

按主要貨品類別分析

二零二五年九月份與二零二四年同月比較，大部分主要貨品類別的整體出口貨值錄得升幅，尤其是「電動機械、儀器和用具及零件」（增437億元，升22.8%）和「通訊、錄音及音響設備和儀器」（增65億元，升14.5%）。

同期，大部分主要貨品類別的進口貨值錄得升幅，尤其是「電動機械、儀器和用具及零件」（增401億元，升20.3%）、「雜項製品（主要包括珠寶、金飾及銀器）」（增95億元， 升33.6%）和「通訊、錄音及音響設備和儀器」（增94億元，升18.6%）。

評論

政府發言人表示，九月商品出口貨值繼續顯著增長，按年上升16.1%。輸往內地和大部分其他亞洲市場的出口蓬勃增長，輸往美國和歐盟的出口亦溫和增長。同時，大部分主要商品的出口上升，尤其是電動設備、機械及機械用具的出口繼續強勁增長。

展望未來，環球經濟持續擴張，應會繼續支持香港的商品貿易表現。政府一直致力加深香港與不同市場的經貿聯繫亦有幫助。然而，美國貿易政策將繼續為國際貿易流向的短期前景帶來不確定性。政府會密切監察情況，並保持警覺。

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that the value of merchandise exports continued to grow visibly by 16.1% in September over a year earlier. Exports to the Mainland and most other Asian markets saw robust growth, and exports to the United States and the European Union also grew moderately. Meanwhile, exports of most major commodities increased, particularly for exports of electrical equipment, machinery and mechanical appliances which continued to see strong growth.

  Looking ahead, Hong Kong's merchandise trade performance should continue to be underpinned by the sustained expansion in the global economy. The Government's ongoing endeavour in enhancing economic and trade ties with different markets also helps. Yet, the United States' trade policy will continue to cast uncertainties on the near-term outlook of international trade flows. The Government will monitor the situation closely and stay vigilant.

The latest promotional video for HA Go was also premiered at the event, aiming to enhance the public's understanding of the diverse functions of HA Go, enabling them to manage their health with just one click.

The HA Chief Executive, Dr Libby Lee, said, ""Since its launch in 2019, HA Go has been well-received by the public. With HA Go, citizens can access various public hospital services more conveniently, quickly and smoothly, while also helping them manage their personal and family health more effectively. We will continue to enhance the functions of HA Go, aiming to make it an essential 'health manager' on every citizen's smartphone.""

As of the third quarter of this year, HA Go has recorded over 4.12 million downloads, with more than 3.25 million registered full members and over 370 000 registered carers.

Mr Fan said, ""The HA's promotion of HA Go marks a significant milestone in the development of Hong Kong's public healthcare services.""

Mr Fan added, Hong Kong is advancing from stability to prosperity. I urge citizens not only to download and use HA Go, but also to care about Hong Kong's future. Let us fulfill our civic responsibilities by voting in the Legislative Council General Election on December 7, electing capable LegCo members to jointly promote the development of Hong Kong and build a better public healthcare system together.

The HA will launch a three-week large-scale promotional campaign to highlight HA Go's features and benefits across various platforms. Hospital clusters will set up promotional booths and arrange for patient service ambassadors and volunteer teams to organise a series of promotional and educational activities to encourage more citizens to download and use HA Go, thereby enhancing the service experience at public hospitals."

New round of applications under Quality Enhancement Support Scheme of self-financing post-secondary education opens,2025-10-27 15:30,2025-10-27 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700233.htm,"The Education Bureau today (October 27) invites applications for the 2025/26 Quality Enhancement Support Scheme (QESS) of the Self-financing Post-secondary Education Fund for projects proposed to be launched in the 2026/27 academic year. The application deadline is February 28, 2026.

The QESS is a major support measure to promote the healthy and sustainable development of the self-financing post-secondary education sector, with the aim of enhancing the quality of teaching and learning in the sector. It accepts applications under three project categories, namely theme-based projects, open-ended projects and industrial attachment projects.

Applicants in the category of theme-based projects may set their own themes, provided that the projects are conducted in a collaborative manner, i.e. planned and undertaken by more than one eligible institution, to foster closer collaboration and synergy among institutions and benefit the sector as widely as possible.

The applicants in the category of open-ended projects need to submit applications in relation to the relevant areas of the QESS funding. The main areas include:

(1) improving the overall learning experience and language proficiency of students;

(2) developing and improving teaching methodologies and practices, including the development of assessment strategies;

(3) strengthening and improving quality assurance and related measures; and

(4) enhancing student support and career guidance services, including support for non-Chinese speaking students and students with special educational needs.

As regards the category of industrial attachment projects, applicants can submit proposals within the following areas:

(1) incorporating quality assured work-based learning and assessments into programme curricula through close partnerships with industries;

(2) sourcing more industrial attachment opportunities within and/or outside Hong Kong, and/or enhancement of relevant institutional support for students; and

(3) organising visits or short-term training/courses conducted within and/or outside Hong Kong for students, which are directly relevant to industrial attachments.

All non-profit-making education institutions offering full-time locally accredited self-financing sub-degree or bachelor's degree (including top-up degree) programmes are eligible to apply. Other related bodies such as the federations of these education institutions and quality assurance agencies may also apply. All applications will be considered by the Sub-committee on Support Measures established under the Committee on Self-financing Post-secondary Education.

Since its launch in 2012, the QESS has approved over 120 projects with a total grant of about $455 million. In the 2024/25 round of applications, five out of 33 applications were approved, with a total earmarked grant of about $23 million, which aim to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced teaching resource hub for the sector; develop an AI-powered virtual laboratory platform for healthcare education; establish an industry-university partnerships office; enhance students' emotional wellness and resilience; and provide non-local students with holistic support.

Further details of the QESS, including the scope of various project categories and the application procedures, are available at the Concourse for Self-financing Post-secondary Education (www.cspe.edu.hk/en/qess-project.html)."

  An FEHD spokesman said that the annual FMP New Year Fair will be held for 15 consecutive days from February 17 to March 3 next year. A total of 21 dry goods stalls and six wet goods stalls will be put up for auction, with upset prices of $780 and $770 respectively.

  The open auction will be held at the Assembly Hall, 2/F, Lai Chi Kok Government Offices, 19 Lai Wan Road, Lai Chi Kok, Kowloon, on November 10 (Monday), from 2pm until the completion of the auction.

  Bidders for FMP New Year Fair stalls must be at least 18 years old and ordinarily reside in Hong Kong. Anyone can bid for more than one stall. A bidder must pay the bid price and register in person with his or her own name as the licensee of the stall immediately after successfully bidding for a stall. The bidder is also required to sign at once a licence agreement with the FEHD, or he/she will forfeit the rights to operate the stall.

  The FMP New Year Fair will be made available to the licensees three days in advance of the fair (from February 14 to 16, 2026) for the setting up of stalls. In the event of any unforeseeable incident that will cause a reduction of the whole licence period (including the duration for setting up stalls and the business period of the fair), the Government has the right to postpone the commencement date and shorten the duration of the period.

凡年滿十八歲或以上並通常居於香港的人士均可參加放馬莆新春市場攤位競投。競投人士可競投多於一個攤位。投得攤位後，競投人士須即時繳付成功出價的款額及親自以自己名義登記為有關攤位的獲許可人，並須即場簽署特許協議，否則會喪失獲得經營該攤位的權利。

放馬莆新春市場於開放前三日（即二○二六年二月十四至十六日）供獲許可人搭建攤位。若出現無法預料的情況，導致整段特許期（包括搭建攤位和新春市場營業時間）縮短，政府有權延遲開始日期和縮短特許期，食環署會把競投價格（使用費）按剩餘日期比例無息退還予攤位獲許可人。

食環署提醒攤位獲許可人只可在其攤位售賣及推廣准售商品，不得使用准用範圍作任何其他活動。倘食環署認為獲許可人在場地內為宣傳、推廣、陳列、展示、售賣或送贈任何准售商品而進行的活動是違法、不利於國家安全、不道德，或是不符合放馬莆新春市場的宗旨，食環署有權指示獲許可人停止有關活動，而獲許可人必須立即遵從署方指示。

攤位獲許可人亦須明確同意，不會在准用範圍及其附近地方銷毀、毀爛或棄置任何未售出的商品。攤位獲許可人須在二○二六年三月三日下午六時前，把整個檔架及一切營業工具移離准用範圍，並清理所有垃圾、廢屑和未售出的商品（不論損毀與否）。

此外，特許協議亦列明乾貨攤位的高度不得距離地面超過三米。濕貨攤位的高度不得距離地面超過四米半。濕貨攤位的高度如距離地面超過三米，獲許可人須自費聘用一名認可人士、註冊結構工程師或《建築地盤（安全）規例》（第59I章）規定的合資格人士，在活動舉行前為其攤位准用範圍內的搭建物向食環署提供安全證明的正本，並在該攤位的搭建物上張貼一份上述安全證明的副本。另外，活動式帳篷（如使用）的每個邊角及錨固點均須以適當配重物（如沙袋或活動式帳篷專用注水底座）牢固固定。當強烈季候風信號即將發出或生效時，獲許可人須立即檢查攤位，並按需要採取加固措施。

投得攤位的人士須遵守特許協議內所列的全部條款及規定，否則署方有權解除該特許協議，而獲許可人須即時將攤位騰空。

The arrangements aim to further streamline the application process and expedite the issuance of licences, in order to provide convenience to food business operators participating in public functions of a short duration.

In accordance with the Food Business Regulation (Cap. 132X), any person who intends to prepare and/or manufacture food for sale for human consumption off the premises must obtain a food factory licence issued by the FEHD before commencement of such a business. For a food business which involves the operation of a stall/kiosk of a temporary nature for sale of heating up/warming precooked food and/or cooking of preprepared, ready-to-cook food for human consumption off the premises in conjunction with a public function (e.g. exhibition, show, concert, sporting contest) of a short duration, a temporary food factory licence must be obtained. The validity period of a temporary food factory licence shall not exceed seven days, and the licence fee is $220.

In order to streamline the application process and shorten the time for applicants to obtain a licence, the FEHD is enhancing the payment arrangements for licence fees. Upon submission of a temporary food factory licence application, the applicant will have to enclose the fee payment for the granting of a licence. The FEHD will process the application as usual. Upon the approval of an application, the FEHD will issue the notification letter and relevant licence to the applicant.

Applicants may submit their applications, pay the licence fees, and collect the licences via electronic means, in person or by authorising another person to visit the Licence Issuing Office on their behalf, or by post.

If a licence application is eventually not approved or cancelled by the applicant, he or she may apply to the FEHD for a refund.

For details about the new arrangements, please visit the FEHD's website or contact the relevant Licensing Office."

"LCSD to hold vocal lecture series ""The Human Voice in 4 Parts"" in January next year",2025-10-27 14:30,2025-10-27 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700288.htm,"  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department will launch a vocal lecture series entitled ""The Human Voice in 4 Parts"" on four consecutive Wednesdays in January next year. Curated and hosted by voice pedagogue Chan Siu-kwan, each of the four lectures will feature one of the four main voice types (namely bass, alto, soprano and tenor) in Western classical music. Accompanied by selected excepts from Western opera works, the speaker will examine the roles portrayed by each voice type, and introduce the respective iconic legends along with their vocal features, guiding audiences to understand and appreciate the unique charm of different voice types.

  Details of each lecture are as follows:

Lecture 1: Bass
-----------------------
Date: January 7 (Wednesday)

  Two of the lowest male voice types are the bass and the baritone. In this lecture, drawing on performance excerpts of renowned singers such as baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky and bass Boris Christoff, the speaker will analyse the moments when these two voice types assign to take the leading male roles in opera.

Lecture 2: Alto
-----------------------
Date: January 14 (Wednesday)

  The speaker will examine why mezzo-sopranos and altos are often cast as supporting roles such as mothers, ladies-in-waiting or villainesses in opera, alongside the moments when these two voice types assume leading roles. This lecture will also introduce the ""castrati"", a dark chapter in music history, and the countertenors.

Lecture 3: Soprano
-----------------------
Date: January 21 (Wednesday)

  Through a selection of compelling excerpts, the speaker will explore why female leads in opera are predominantly performed by sopranos. Recordings of celebrated performances by divas such as Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland will be presented to illustrate what composers expect of the prima donna.

Lecture 4: Tenor
-----------------------
Date: January 28 (Wednesday)

  In the Romantic period, male leads in opera are mainly dominated by tenors. By featuring treasured recordings of Nicolai Gedda and Luciano Pavarotti, who was hailed as the ""King of High-Cs"", among others, this lecture will delve into the unique charm of the tenor voice.

  Chan is an eminent vocalist and expert in choral singing in Hong Kong. She currently teaches voice at the music departments of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Baptist University. She also serves as the vocal advisor of the Hong Kong Children's Choir. Chan often gives vocal masterclasses, and conducts vocal workshops for singers and choir conductors, in addition to serving as adjudicator in singing competitions.

  All lectures will be conducted in Cantonese and will start at 7.30pm at the Lecture Hall of the Hong Kong Space Museum. Each lecture will run for about one hour and 30 minutes. Tickets priced at $80 (for each lecture, with free seating) are now available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings and concessionary schemes, please call 3166 1288.

âThe Hospital Authority (HA) spokesperson today (October 27) announced that a total of 15 Family Medicine Clinics (FMCs), including Family Medicine Integrated Centres (FMICs), will provide public holiday Family Medicine Outpatient Services on the Chung Yeung Festival holiday (October 29) (see table below). Members of the public can make appointments through the telephone appointment system or the ""Book FMC"" function on the ""HA Go"" mobile application.

As influenza activity remains at a high level, the HA spokesperson appeals to members of the public to receive vaccinations early. Public hospitals and outpatient clinics of the HA have started providing seasonal influenza vaccinations to eligible persons to dovetail with the Government Vaccination Programme 2025/26. Eligible patients may receive vaccinations at their scheduled follow-up appointments at clinics. Patients with distant follow-up appointment dates may visit or contact the respective clinics for necessary arrangements.

Meanwhile, the HA spokesperson reminds the public to stay vigilant about personal and environmental hygiene during the holidays to avoid spreading diseases. Members of the public who develop respiratory symptoms should wear masks and seek medical advice promptly. Non-emergency patients should avoid using Accident & Emergency services and instead seek treatment at FMCs and FMICs, private doctors or 24-hour outpatient services at private hospitals to reduce pressure on public hospital A&Es. Members of the public can visit the Health Bureau's Primary Care Directory www.pcdirectory.gov.hk to choose a family doctor and view related clinic service information.

消防處嚴陣以待並作出特別行動部署，包括於剛過去的周末設立高級指揮室，以加強各行動單位之間的協調和應對山火的能力，以及透過靈活調配內部資源，增加前線人手及消防車輛應對突發事故。

消防處經評估後鎖定新界北區八個山火熱點，聯同民眾安全服務隊，額外調配超過200名前線人員，組成巡邏小隊在熱點巡邏，提醒市民注意火種，並在可行情況下快速撲滅初期火勢，防止山火蔓延。

另一方面，消防處積極集合地區力量進行防火宣傳，透過消防處社區聯動網絡與地區防火委員會加強聯繫，並聯同消防處社區應急先鋒名譽會長會及消防處社區應急先鋒，由剛過去的周末開始，於多個掃墓熱點及鄉郊地區向市民推廣防火安全教育。

在科技應用方面，消防處除使用搭載揚聲器的無人機於掃墓熱點廣播防火信息外，亦首次應用兩個低空經濟「監管沙盒」項目，包括運用可負載30公斤的大型無人機運送滅火工具，如背泵及山草拍等，提升行動效率；另外亦使用無人機搭配自動化無人機機場，在郊野地區自動定期巡邏，並配合人工智能技術以偵測早期火災，有助救援人員能更早掌握現場情況及作出相應部署。

數據顯示，大部分山火都因人為疏忽引起，因此防止山火實有賴各方通力合作。消防處提醒市民切勿留下火種或燃燒野草，一同為防止山火出一分力。"

FSD's special operations deployment for hill fires during Chung Yeung Festival (with photos),2025-10-27 12:00,2025-10-27 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102400600.htm,"âThe Fire Services Department (FSD) today (October 27) announced the special operations deployment for hill fires during the Chung Yeung Festival. It also urged members of the public to avoid leaving ignition sources when paying tribute to ancestors at graveyards or visiting the countryside to prevent hill fires.

The FSD is fully prepared and launched the special operations deployment, including setting up a High Command in the past weekend to strengthen co-ordination and the capability to respond to hill fires among operational units. Additionally, through flexible allocation of internal resources, extra frontline staff and fire services appliances were deployed to handle emergencies.

The FSD identified eight hill fire hotspots in North District in the New Territories after assessment. Over 200 additional frontline staff from the FSD and the Civil Aid Service were deployed to form patrol teams to patrol these hotspots. The teams served to remind the public to be cautious with fire, and to quickly extinguish initial fires to prevent the spread of hill fires where feasible.

Meanwhile, the FSD actively collaborated with the community on fire prevention publicity. With the strengthened ties with the District Fire Safety Committees through the FSD Community Collaboration Network, and in collaboration with the FSD Community Emergency Responder Honorary Presidents' Association and FSD Community Emergency Responders, the department disseminated fire safety messages to the public at various graveyards and rural areas over the past weekend.

In terms of technology application, apart from using drones equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast fire prevention messages at graveyards, the FSD also utilised two low-altitude economy Regulatory Sandbox projects for the first time. The department deployed a 30-kilogram payload capacity drone to transport fire-fighting equipment such as flexible backpack pumps and fire beaters to enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, drones and automated drone docks were deployed to conduct regular autonomic patrols in the countryside to achieve early fire detection by leveraging AI technology. The equipment enabled rescuers to appraise the onsite situation more promptly and make deployments accordingly.

As data revealed that most hill fires are caused by human negligence, preventing hill fires relies on the collaborative efforts of various parties. The FSD reminds the public not to leave any ignition sources or to burn weeds in order to prevent hill fires."
申訴專員全面調查滲水投訴調查聯合辦事處就滲水問題的處理（附圖）,2025-10-27 11:00,2025-10-27 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700239.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（十月二十七日）宣布展開全面調查，詳細審研滲水投訴調查聯合辦事處（滲水辦）就滲水問題的處理。

滲水成因複雜，包括因樓宇結構或裝置出現問題，又或樓宇欠缺適當保養而引致。若滲水造成滋擾影響公眾衞生、構成樓宇結構安全風險，政府便會考慮行使法例賦予的權力介入。政府成立滲水辦，目標是透過為市民提供一站式服務處理滲水的舉報，加快調查及找出滲水源頭，並提高解決滲水問題的成功率。

公署接獲申訴，指稱因上層單位在平台僭建引致下層單位滲水，但滲水辦未有適時進行滲水調查，屋宇署發出清拆令逾年但僭建物仍未清拆，以致問題持續。

陳積志表示：「巿民大眾都希望有個安穩舒適的居所。但滲水問題一直以來都會為巿民帶來不少困擾。根據政府的統計資料，在二○二二、二三及二四年三年間，滲水辦接獲的樓宇滲水投訴個案分別為39 555宗、45 033宗和47 299宗。公署亦經常接獲巿民就滲水問題提出申訴。另外，有資料顯示屋宇署在發出清拆令後未有適時要求業主遵辦，以致可能因僭建而引致的滲水持續。因此，我決定展開這項全面調查，詳細審研滲水辦就滲水問題的處理，包括納入屋宇署處理引致滲水的僭建物調查的程序，探討當中有否改善空間，並提出適切改善建議。公署亦十分關注滲水辦的整體運作，將以系列形式深入探討滲水辦的調查行動過程及成效，包括滲水辦對顧問公司的監管。」

申訴專員歡迎市民以書面提出意見。請於二○二五年十一月二十七日或之前把意見送達申訴專員公署：

Ombudsman probes handling of water seepage cases by Joint Office for Investigation of Water Seepage Complaints (with photos),2025-10-27 11:00,2025-10-27 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700244.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

  The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (October 27) announced the launch of a full investigation into the Joint Office for Investigation of Water Seepage Complaints (JO)'s handling of water seepage cases.

  The causes of water seepage are complex. It may result from defective building structures or installations, or from a lack of proper maintenance. If the seepage poses a nuisance, public health hazard or a potential risk to building safety, the Government may consider exercising its statutory powers to intervene. To enhance efficiency in handling reports of water seepage, the Government has established the JO to provide the public with a one-stop service. The objective is to expedite investigations for identifying the source of seepage more effectively, and improve the success rate in resolving seepage problems.

  The Office noted from complaint handling that unauthorised building works (UBWs) on a flat roof of an upper flat have caused water seepage in the lower flat. However, the JO did not conduct an investigation into the seepage problem in a timely manner. Although the Buildings Department (BD) issued a removal order over a year ago, the UBWs have yet to be demolished, resulting in the continued seepage problem.

  Mr Chan said, ""It is Hong Kong people’s common hope that they should be able to enjoy a well-maintained and comfortable living environment, but water seepage problems undoubtedly cause much inconvenience and distress to affected residents. According to government statistics, in 2022, 2023 and 2024 the number of complaints about water seepage in buildings received by the JO was 39 555, 45 033 and 47 299 respectively. Also, complaints from the public regarding unresolved seepage problems are common. In addition, there is information indicating that the BD did not promptly enforce compliance with removal orders issued against UBWs, resulting in persistent seepage problems potentially caused by the UBWs. In this light, I have decided to launch a full investigation into the JO's handling of water seepage cases, including the BD’s procedures for handling UBWs that may lead to water seepage, to identify areas for improvement and to put forward appropriate recommendations. We are also very concerned about the overall operation of the JO and will launch a series of reviews to probe deeply into the JO's investigation operation process and effectiveness, including the JO's monitoring of its consultants.""

  The Ombudsman welcomes views from members of the public on this topic. Written submissions should reach the Office by November 27, 2025:

Taxi Written Test to be further enhanced from November 3 to attract newcomers to join taxi industry,2025-10-27 10:00,2025-10-27 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102400412.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (October 27) reminded candidates and those interested in sitting the Taxi Written Test that the Test has been further enhanced, and will be applicable from November 3, encouraging newcomers to join the taxi industry.

  The new Written Test (for fresh candidates or repeaters) comprises Part A ""Taxi Operation"" and Part B ""Road Users' Code"". Part A ""Taxi Operation"" will include new questions relating to the series of new measures introduced for enhancing taxi service quality (e.g. taxi fleet regime and the Taxi-Driver-Offence Points system). The questions on prominent locations and route identification have been substantially reduced and simplified in consideration of the development of navigation technology. Part B ""Road Users' Code"" will include knowledge on road traffic regulations and safe driving. The Written Test is conducted in the form of multiple-choice questions, and the total number of questions has been adjusted from 90 to 75, while the passing criteria and time allowed for each part remain unchanged. To score an overall pass result, a candidate must meet the passing criteria in both Parts A and B.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""The further enhanced Taxi Written Test will better align with the practical needs of the taxi trade while maintaining the level of assessment, ensuring that taxi drivers possess the necessary professional knowledge and qualities. We hope that more newcomers will be attracted to join the taxi industry to foster the healthy development of the taxi trade in the long run. Furthermore, following the passage of the bill on ride-hailing service, taxi driving licence holders can apply for a ride-hailing vehicle driving permit in future without having to sit an additional test.""

  The TD has issued letters to the taxi trade introducing the scope of the new Written Test, and distributed the updated Guide to Taxi Written Test and Taxi Operation Booklet to candidates concerned. Candidates can refer to the TD's website and book a Taxi Written Test online via GovHK."

Professor Dennis Lo (President of the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences), Future Science Prize Laureates, Mr Victor Wang (Rotating Chairman of 2021 & 2025 Future Science Prize Donor's Congress), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

It is my great honour to join you this evening to celebrate the remarkable achievements of the seven Future Science Prize Laureates this year: Professor Ji Qiang, Professor Xu Xing, Professor Zhou Zhonghe, Professor Fang Zhong, Professor Dai Xi, Professor Ding Hong, and Professor Lu Chih-Yuan. Please accept my heartiest congratulations.

Their groundbreaking discoveries, exceptional passion and unwavering dedication have not only pushed the boundaries of human knowledge but also inspired generations to pursue excellence in science. Their work reminds us of how scientific endeavour drives progress for humanity.

Tonight, we also mark the 10th anniversary of the Future Science Prize — a decade of recognising brilliance in science. Over the years, this prestigious prize has grown into a beacon of innovation, celebrating the most brilliant minds whose work has deepened our understanding of the world and opened up new possibilities for the future.

More than a prize, what is most heartening is your strong commitment to nurturing the next generation of scientific talent. Beyond honouring established scientists, the Future Science Prize Foundation also puts a bright spotlight on emerging researchers, while actively engaging the public through exhibitions, dialogues between scientists and youth, and other outreach initiatives. These efforts bring science into the heart of the society. They not only ignite enthusiasm in science and foster collaboration, but also help to cultivate a rich scientific culture — one that inspires more people to participate in research and innovation, and contribute to global scientific advancement.

On this note, my sincere gratitude to the Future Science Prize Foundation, the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences, and all the partners for the work well done.

Here in Hong Kong, our vision is to emerge as a leading international innovation and technology hub. It will be a key engine of our economic growth and an important source of career opportunities. Central to this vision is the seamless integration of upstream basic research with downstream industrial application. Basic science is the foundation of all technological innovation, and Hong Kong is well-positioned with our world-class universities and research institutions. And together with Shenzhen and Guangzhou, we have been ranked the world's most innovative cluster by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

At the same time, we are actively advancing the commercialisation of research outcomes and building a stronger innovation and technology ecosystem. This is driven by a multi-pronged strategy: first, directing market capital into strategic and emerging sectors such as AI and biotech — that is why we set up the Hong Kong Investment Corporation, which is patient capital willing to invest in small, early-stage companies with cutting-edge technologies, even though their eventual success may be uncertain.

Second, establish a dedicated office, the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, to attract leading tech leading enterprises. Third, we also modified our various talent admission schemes to expand our talent pool.

And finally, deepening collaboration with cities across the Greater Bay Area and other areas to enable synergistic collaboration and development.

This is a collective endeavour that calls for strong cross-sector partnerships. I invite all of you to join us in speedily turning this vision into reality.

Ladies and gentlemen, as we bring this memorable Future Science Prize Week to a close, let us remember that science is humanity's guiding light — a universal force for good that recognises no borders. In that spirit, Hong Kong will always welcome global scientific talent and remain open to international collaboration and exchange.

Together, we can build a future of shared prosperity and boundless opportunity for humanity.

And finally, please mark your diary for another important event: December 7, our Legislative Council election day. It is important for our future."

CHP investigates first local chikungunya fever case in Hong Kong (with photos),2025-10-26 19:40,2025-10-26 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/26/P2025102600593.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 4pm today (October 26), the CHP has recorded one new locally acquired case of chikungunya fever (CF), marking the first such case in Hong Kong. The CHP has initiated appropriate infection control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

Latest case information
----------------------------
The case involves an 82-year-old female living in Fung Tak Estate in Wong Tai Sin. She developed swollen and painful left ankle since October 18, and fever and limbs joint pain on October 22. She sought medical attention from a private doctor on the same day, and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital the following day (October 23). She was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. The patient is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Qingyuan in Guangdong in late August but had no travel history during the incubation period (two to 12 days prior to onset). The case is classified as a local case. The patient has four household contacts who are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
----------------------------------------------------------
In response to the abovementioned local case, the CHP today has conducted inter-departmental meeting with various departments and relevant organisations, including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Wong Tai Sin District Office (WTSDO) and Hong Kong Housing Authority, to ensure that all units implement various preventive and control measures in a speedy and orderly manner.

As at 5pm yesterday, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 46 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. None of the 46 patients lives near the abovementioned local case. Given that the activity areas of the 82-year-old patient are primarily within the estate, the CHP cannot rule out the possibility that unidentified infected patient(s) in the area may have transmitted the virus to mosquitoes in the estate, leading to her infection. 

The CHP is implementing prevention and control measures according to epidemiological investigations and risk assessment, including providing medical surveillance and health advice to household contacts of the case or those with common exposure to the source of infection. The CHP will arrange for laboratory testingif they presented with relevant symptoms. The CHP officers and District Services & Community Care Teams(Care Teams) will contact about 8 000 households and carry out questionnaire surveys to understand and follow up their health conditions. The CHP urged the residents to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 1.

The CHP will hold an online live seminar at 8.30pm tonight. Doctors will explain the symptoms of CF, how to prevent infection and how to properly use insect repellents. The CHP and WTSDO will organise a public health talk at the at Fung Tak Estate Community Centre at 8pm tomorrow (October 27) to enhance public understanding of this mosquito-borne disease and encourage active participation in prevention efforts to protect both oneself and others.

In addition, the CHP has set up a health consultation booth at 2/F, Fung Tak Shopping Centre, where assessments will be provided to residents with relevant symptoms from today. The CHP will also setup an inquiry hotline (2125 2373), which will operate from 9am to 8pm.

The CHP, together with the FEHD, have inspected various locations in the vicinity of patient's residence, conducted vector investigations and mosquito control operations to minimise the risk of local transmission. Furthermore, the CHP will issue letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and remaining them to be vigilant.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year. In fact, overall mosquito infestation indices this year are lower than that of the previous years. The mosquito infestation index in September was 2.5 per cent, which decreased significantly from 9.5 per cent in June. The index available for October also remains at a low level. Regarding the investigation area of the local case, the latestarea gravidtrap index (AGI) in October was 1.7 per cent, while the AGI in September was 0.9 per cent, indicating the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive. Among which, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, these measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures. The Environment and Ecology Bureau will hold Steering Committee meeting to lead relevant departments to step up mosquito prevention and elimination measures; the district offices of the FEHD will hold interdepartmental meetings at district level to undergo risk assessment and conduct targeted measures.

The WTSDO is working closely with the CHP to disseminate information on CF, including arranging Care Teams to distribute leaflets and surveys to each household unit, contact Link to facilitate the setup of a health consultation booth at the shopping centre nearby, and arranging health talk for the residents to be held tomorrow night.

Latest surveillance data
-----------------------------
Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Preventive measures taken by the public
-------------------------------------------------
Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
