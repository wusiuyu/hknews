Voters urged to vote in Election Committee Subsector By-elections today (with photos),2025-09-07 13:50,2025-09-07 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700417.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Electoral Affairs Commission:

The Chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC), Mr Justice David Lok, called on voters to cast their votes in the 2025 Election Committee Subsector By-elections today (September 7) after visiting the Central Command Centre and the Statistical Information Centre located at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) this morning.

 Mr Justice Lok said, ""In view of the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 issued by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) in the early hours today, the EAC and the Registration and Electoral Office will maintain close communication with the HKO and closely monitor the weather developments. Based on the HKO's latest weather forecast, the Election Committee Subsector By-elections has proceeded today as scheduled. Further notification will be made if there is any other arrangement. As at 11am, 2 369 voters across all polling stations have voted, bringing the accumulative turnout rate to 65.24 per cent.

""Voters and authorised representatives (ARs) are required to vote at their designated polling station as specified on their poll card. The Electronic Poll Register (EPR) system is used to issue ballot papers at the ordinary polling stations in the By-elections. A voter or an AR must produce the original of his/her valid Hong Kong identity (HKID) card at the ballot paper issuing desk in the polling station. The polling staff will scan the HKID card of the voter or AR using a tablet of the EPR system to verify the identity by his/her particulars and mark a record on the system before issuing the ballot paper(s).

""When marking the ballot paper, voters/ARs must fill in the ovals opposite the name(s) of the candidate(s) of their choice with the black pen provided at the polling station, and vote for no more than the prescribed number of seats in the relevant subsector, otherwise the ballot paper will be regarded as invalid. The maximum number of candidates that can be voted for in the subsector concerned will be indicated clearly on the ballot paper. Introduction to Candidates leaflet/booklet on candidates printed by the Registration and Electoral Office are also available at all polling stations for reference by voters/ARs.

""After marking the ballot paper, a voter or an AR may use the ballot paper checking machine provided at the polling station voluntarily to scan the marked ballot paper(s) in order to check whether the ballot paper(s) has/have been marked according to the electoral law, or directly put the ballot paper(s), unfolded, into the ballot box with the marked side facing down.""

Voters/ARs can check the approximate waiting time of each polling station on the election website (www.elections.gov.hk). Relevant signage will also be placed outside the polling stations for reference. Depending on the waiting situation and their schedule, voters/ARs can make their own arrangements on when to vote.

Once the poll is closed, all ballot boxes will be delivered to the Central Counting Station (CCS) at the HKCEC for counting. Candidates, election agents and counting agents may enter the CCS and observe the count at designated areas of the counting zone. Members of the public and media may also enter the public area of the CCS to observe the count. Once the counting of votes is completed, the election results will be declared by the Returning Officers to the candidates and their agents at the counting zone. The election results of each subsector will be announced again by the Returning Officers on the stage of the Media Centre later. A public gallery will be set up at the Media Centre for members of the public to watch the announcement. The election results will be displayed outside the CCS (including the Media Centre) and published via press releases and the election website.

 Five ordinary polling stations (located in the Exhibition Gallery at Hong Kong Central Library, Kowloon Park Sports Centre, Wai Tsuen Sports Centre, Tiu Keng Leng Sports Centre and Che Kung Temple Sports Centre) and one dedicated polling station at Happy Valley Police Station are open from 9am to 6pm today for about 3 600 voters/ARs to cast their votes. In the By-elections, there are 28 candidates contesting a total of 21 seats in six subsectors. The six contested subsectors are commercial (third); architectural, surveying, planning and landscape; technology and innovation; labour; representatives of members of Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees, and District Fire Safety Committees of Hong Kong and Kowloon; and representatives of members of Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees, and District Fire Safety Committees of the New Territories.

 Mr Justice Lok and EAC Members Professor Daniel Shek and Mr Bernard Man, SC, will respectively inspect different polling stations this afternoon to see for themselves how electoral activities are conducted.

 The election hotline at 2891 1001 will be in service until 6.30pm today to answer enquiries relating to the By-elections. Two complaints hotlines at 2827 7251/3707 0188 will also operate until 6.30pm to handle complaints about breaches of electoral rules and guidelines.

 Hourly voter turnouts and election results will be available on the election website."

​律政司副司長在青Teen友法師友計劃2025啟動禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-09-07 10:52,2025-09-07 11:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700301.htm,"以下是律政司副司長張國鈞博士今日（九月七日）在青Teen友法師友計劃2025啟動禮致辭：

尊敬的Roden會長（香港律師會會長湯文龍）、Sharon（香港律師會「青Teen講場」籌委會主席譚雪欣）、周一鳴處長（警務處處長）、各位立法會議員、各位律師朋友、各位同學：

大家好。很高興今日能夠和大家一起參加香港律師會2025青Teen友法師友計劃的啟動。首先，我要肯定和感謝香港律師會多年來對青年法治教育的貢獻，以薪火相傳的精神，將法治的精神傳承下去。

律師其實是一個「賣時間」的服務性行業，一般來說，香港的律師可以說都是以時間計算收費，我記得當年實習的時候第一件事是要學懂「每六分鐘一個單位」，每做一件工作都要紀錄時間，因為我們「賣」的是時間，所以律師日常的工作一定是非常忙碌。而今日一班非常有心的律師卻願意在忙碌的日程中抽出寶貴，而且很昂貴的時間參與為期兩年的師友計劃，在這個以年計的計劃中，律師導師與同學們建立亦師亦友的關係，不只是傳授法律知識，更是陪伴各位同學們探索自我、規劃未來，並在成長路上希望能夠讓大家自覺地融入對法治的尊重與遵守。我非常欣賞和感謝各位律師朋友身體力行，無私的付出和持續的參與，為社會作出非常重大的貢獻。

而我們作為律師，經常都會遇到朋友會問的一個問題，就是：「究竟讀法律難不難？」我可以告訴大家，如果你將法律抽離現實，每天只在法律條文的文字中琢磨鑽研，你是無法掌握法律的靈魂，也會覺得法律是枯燥無味。但是如果你懂得方法，把法律和我們身邊所發生的事和人物結合起來，你就會了解各種人和事之間的關係，更會明白法律的真締。

為甚麼？試想想，如果世界上只得你一個人，當然這個世界就不必有法律，因為你可以支配世界，為所欲為。但是世界不只得你一個人，而是由很多人組成的社會。社會當中每個人的想法不一樣，價值觀不一樣，甚至做事手法也不一樣。所以，我們就要有一個公平、公開的法律制度去清楚訂明大家的權利和責任，為社會制定一套必須遵守的最低社會標準和底線。有了這個法律制度，大家才能安穩地生活，社會才能穩定地發展。因此，法律是和我們的生活息息相關，緊密相連。透過認識法律，你就會更加能夠認識你身邊的人、身邊的事，甚至更加認識自己。

因此，我衷心感謝各位導師、香港律師會和各個合作單位的付出與支持，為青年朋友提供一個有深度和有溫度的法治教育環境。我更希望各位青年朋友以後都能夠在這個複雜的世界中保持獨立思考，在誘惑面前選擇正直，在困難中堅持信念。

祝2025青Teen友法師友計劃取得圓滿成功。多謝大家。"

Employers and employees should make prior work arrangements in times of tropical cyclones and rainstorms,2025-09-07 02:41,2025-09-07 05:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090601000.htm,"  As the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 (T3) is now in force, the Labour Department (LD) today (Date) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of establishments, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

  ""In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements and contingency measures for periods during and after tropical cyclone warnings and rainstorm warnings, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

  To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees, as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or when the extreme conditions come to an end, and when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather and extreme conditions.

  ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when a tropical cyclone warning, rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.
 
  When a Pre-No. 8 Special Announcement is issued during working hours, within two hours before the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 is expected to take effect, employers should release employees from workplaces or from work in stages or arrange for them to work remotely according to the agreed work arrangements. To ensure the safety of employees and to enable them to arrive home before suspension of public transport services, employees who have mobility problems (for example, pregnant employees or those with a disability), employees who rely on transport services which are prone to being affected by adverse weather conditions (for example, ferry services) to get home, and those who work in or are living in remote areas (for example, outlying islands) should be given priority to leave. Other employees should be released from workplaces or from work in stages according to their travelling distance or the time required for returning home.
  
  If an Amber, Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.
   
  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance on the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 (T8) or higher, Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.
  
  The spokesman also reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.

  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when there is a T8 signal or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."
僱主僱員應預先訂立熱帶氣旋及暴雨下的工作安排,2025-09-07 02:40,2025-09-07 05:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090600997.htm,"由於三號熱帶氣旋警告信號現已生效，勞工處今日（九月七日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告及極端情況下及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以確保僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主在擬訂及執行在熱帶氣旋及暴雨警告下及其後的工作安排和應變措施時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮他們的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。

當天文台在工作時間內、預計八號熱帶氣旋警告信號生效前的兩小時內發出預警，僱主應按協定的工作安排讓僱員分批離開工作地點、下班或遙距工作。為確保僱員安全和趕及在公共交通服務停止前回家，一些行動不便的僱員（例如懷孕或殘疾僱員）、須依靠容易受惡劣天氣影響的交通服務（例如渡輪服務）返回居所的僱員，以及於偏遠地點工作或居住的僱員（例如離島），應獲准優先離開。僱主亦應安排其他僱員按返家路程的距離或所需時間分批離開工作地點或下班。

如果黃色、紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外及空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣或極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號、黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。

另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"

Rowing competition for 60th anniversary of Dongjiang water supply to HK concludes (with photos),2025-09-06 18:40,2025-09-07 05:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/06/P2025090500570.htm,"This year marks the 60th anniversary of Dongjiang water supply to Hong Kong. To commemorate and celebrate this remarkable milestone, a series of celebration events have been held under the theme ""Dongjiang River - An Inseparable Bond, Our Blessed Origin"" in phases since September last year. Following the running competition held in November last year, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) today (September 6) held a rowing competition at the Jockey Club Sha Tin Rowing Centre to commemorate six decades of Dongjiang water supply. The Permanent Secretary for Development (Works), Mr Ricky Lau, officiated at the event and presented the award to the overall champion of the rowing competition in the company of the Director of Water Supplies, Mr Roger Wong.

Speaking at the event, Mr Lau said that rowing emphasises the importance of teamwork and the spirit of persistence, which is a vivid portrayal of the journey of Dongjiang water supply to Hong Kong. Over the past 60 years, numerous project builders and construction workers from Guangdong and Hong Kong have made selfless contributions to the project and overcome many difficulties through concerted effort, echoing the spirit of unity and resilience demonstrated in the water supply collaboration. He urged everyone to reflect on how to cherish water resources - whether through conserving water or exploiting new water resources - to help Hong Kong move toward a sustainable future without water shortages.

Mr Wong remarked that, with a view to deepening the public's understanding of the history of Dongjiang water supply to Hong Kong and its significance, the Development Bureau and the WSD have organised a number of celebration and commemoration events since September last year. Various commemoration events will also be taken forward. He pointed out that the ""An Inseparable Bond, Our Blessed Origin: 60th Anniversary of Dongjiang Water Supply to Hong Kong"" exhibition, co-organised by the Chinese Culture Promotion Office of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and the WSD, is now open for free visits at the Hong Kong Museum of History. Other celebration events include the Good Water Good Fish Logo Design Competition, the WSD's Fun Day, and the publication of a commemorative book for the 60th anniversary of Dongjiang water supply to Hong Kong, which will be rolled out one after another.

The rowing competition is jointly organised by the WSD and the Hong Kong, China Rowing Association. The competition comprised flat water and indoor rowing. Flat water rowing includes 1 000m coxed quadruple sculls, 1 000m mixed coxed eight and 250m single board rowing (single - open group). Indoor rowing includes 4x500m team relay, 60-minute team relay and one-minute challenge (single - open group). The event attracted over 250 enrolments from 18works departments, public service organisations,consultancy firms and universities to participate."
CHP urges students to receive seasonal influenza vaccination early in new school year as two cases of severe paediatric influenza A infection reported,2025-09-06 18:40,2025-09-07 05:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/06/P2025090600699.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 6) announced two cases of severe paediatric influenza A infection, with one of the cases co-infected with COVID-19. The CHP urged the public to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times. Schools and parents should arrange their students and children to participate in the seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) programme and receive free SIV to prevent contracting respiratory illnesses.

""Vaccination is the first line of defence against seasonal influenza, reducing the chance of serious complications or death after infection. Including the two abovementioned cases, there had been three severe paediatric influenza cases since the school resumed. Since January this year, the CHP has recorded 14 cases of severe influenza virus infection in children, 10 of them were unvaccinated in the 2024/25 season. Therefore, we hope that schools and parents could make concerted efforts with us and participate in the SIV outreach activities at school, or arrange for their children to visit their family doctor for the SIV at the start of the new school year to enhance their protection,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The first case involved a ten-year-old boy with good past health. He developed a fever, a cough, shortness of breath and a sore throat on September 3. He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Mary Hospital on the next day. He was then admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit of the hospital for treatment. His nasopharyngeal swab and throat swab specimen was positive for influenza A (H1) virus and COVID-19 virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A and COVID-19 co-infection complicated with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure.

The boy had no travel history during the incubation period. His household contacts, so far, are asymptomatic.The boy received the SIV last October.

The second case involved an eight-year-old boy with good past health. He developed a fever, a cough, a headache, vomiting and convulsion since September 4. He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Tuen Mun Hospital yesterday (September 5), and was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit of the Hospital for treatment. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for the influenza A (H3) virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with encephalopathy and shock.

The boy travelled to Shenzhen on August 31. One of his home contact, who is also his travel collateral, developed mild respiratory symptoms on September 2. He sought medical attention and did not require hospitalisation. The boy did not receive the SIV.

Both patients are still hospitalised. There has been no recent influenza outbreak at the two schools they studied.

Besides, since the start of the new school year, there has been a significant increase in the number of outbreak of influenza-like illness (ILI). The CHP recorded four ILI outbreaks in schools in the last week of August (August 24 to August 30), increased to 14 outbreaks in the first six days this week (August 31 to September 5). The 18 outbreaks recorded in the two weeks include kindergartens/child care centres (five cases), primary schools (eight cases) and secondary schools (five cases).

Although Hong Kong has not entered the summer influenza season so far this year, the CHP's latest surveillance data showed that local influenza activity recently indicated an upward fluctuation and slightly exceeded the baseline threshold. The CHP will cautiously monitor the trend of influenza activity in the next few weeks.

Although the latest surveillance data showed that the overall local activity of COVID-19 has remained at a low level, members of the public are advised to take note of the recommendations on the use of COVID-19 vaccines in Hong Kong to protect themselves from serious outcomes of COVID-19. The CHP reminded the public who have not received the initial dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (including infants and children) that they should get vaccinated as soon as possible. Those at high risk (particularly the elderly and persons with underlying comorbidities) should receive a booster dose as soon as possible for effective prevention against COVID-19 to minimise the risk of serious complications and death after infection.

To protect their health and that of their family members, the public should continue to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene and take the following measures to prevent contracting seasonal influenza, COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses:


Persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) should wear surgical masks to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses; high-risk persons (e.g. persons with underlying medical conditions or persons who are immunocompromised) should also wear surgical masks when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Practise hand hygiene frequently, wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin, and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
Avoid sharing personal items;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, consider refraining from going to work or school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, perform physical activity regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-06 17:30,2025-09-07 05:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/06/P2025090600600.htm,"âThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (September 6), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

  ""According to the World Health Organization, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks this year, and as of July this year, over 240 000 cases had been reported in 16 countries/regions worldwide. Of these cases, about 90 were fatal. High temperatures and rainfall levels in summer continue to pose a risk of outbreaks of various mosquito-borne diseases in Hong Kong and around the world, and members of the public must remain vigilant. They must take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have a travel history,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 13 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
再錄得兩宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲學童新學年盡快接種流感疫苗,2025-09-06 17:20,2025-09-07 05:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/06/P2025090600627.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月六日）公布錄得兩宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案，其中一宗個案同時感染2019冠狀病毒病。中心呼籲市民時刻保持良好個人和環境衞生。學校和家長亦應盡快安排學童和子女在新學年參與季節性流感疫苗接種計劃，免費接種流感疫苗，以預防感染呼吸道疾病。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「接種流感疫苗是預防流感的第一道防線，可降低感染後出現嚴重併發症和死亡的機會。計及上述兩宗個案，開學後已錄得三宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案。自今年一月起，中心累計已接獲14宗兒童感染流感病毒的嚴重個案，當中10宗未有接種二○二四／二五季度的疫苗。因此，我們希望學校和家長和我們通力合作，在新學年參與季節性流感疫苗學校外展活動或自行安排子女到家庭醫生接種流感疫苗，加強保障學童健康。」

首宗個案涉及一名過往健康良好的十歲男童，他自九月三日開始出現發燒、咳嗽、氣促和喉嚨痛，翌日到瑪麗醫院急症室求診，其後被安排在該院兒童深切治療部留醫。他的鼻咽及咽喉拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感（H1）病毒及2019冠狀病毒呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感同時感染2019冠狀病毒病併發嚴重肺炎及呼吸衰竭。

男童在潛伏期內沒有外遊，他的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵。男童曾於去年十月接種流感疫苗。

第二宗個案涉及一名過往健康良好的八歲男童，他自九月四日開始出現發燒、咳嗽、頭痛、嘔吐和抽搐，昨日（九月五日）向到屯門醫院急症室求診，被安排在該院兒童深切治療部留醫。他的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感（H3）病毒呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發腦病變及休克。

男童在八月三十一日曾到深圳，一名與他一同外遊的家居接觸者於九月二日出現輕微呼吸道病徵，求醫後無需入院。男童沒有接種流感疫苗。

兩名病人目前仍然留醫，他們就讀的兩間學校近日都沒有出現流感爆發的情況。

另外，新學期開始後，學校出現的流感樣疾病爆發個案顯著增加。中心錄得在學校發生的流感樣疾病爆發個案由八月最後一周（八月二十四日至三十日）的四宗爆發個案，上升至本周首六天（八月三十一日至九月五日）的14宗爆發個案，兩周錄得的共18宗爆發個案涉及幼稚園／幼兒中心（五宗）、小學（八宗）及中學（五宗）。

雖然本港今年暫未出現夏季流感季節，但中心最新監測數據顯示，本地流感活躍程度近期呈現上升波幅，並輕微超越基線水平。中心需要留意未來數周的流感趨勢。

雖然最新監察數據顯示，本地2019冠狀病毒病的整體活躍程度仍然處於低水平，但公眾仍應留意香港有關2019冠狀病毒病疫苗使用的建議，以保護自己受因感染2019冠狀病毒病而導致嚴重後果。中心呼籲未曾接種新冠疫苗初始劑次的人士（包括幼兒及兒童）盡快接種，而高風險市民（特別是長者和長期病患者）應盡快接種新冠疫苗額外加強劑，以有效預防新冠，並減低重症和死亡的風險。

為保障自己和家人健康，市民應繼續保持良好個人和環境衞生，並應採取以下措施，以預防感染季節性流感、2019冠狀病毒病或其他呼吸道疾病：


出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士應佩戴外科口罩，以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，而高危人士（如本身有健康問題或免疫力低的人士）在乘搭公共交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時亦應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
常保持雙手清潔，雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
避免與他人共用個人物品；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，考慮避免上班或上學，避免前往人多擠迫的地方，並盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常做體能活動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。

 The 2025 Election Committee Subsector (ECSS) By-elections will be held tomorrow (September 7). The Chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC), Mr Justice David Lok, accompanied by the Convenor and Members of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), visited the polling station located at the Exhibition Gallery of Hong Kong Central Library, and the Central Counting Station (CCS) and Media Centre located at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) this morning (September 6) and appealed to eligible voters to cast their votes tomorrow.

Mr Justice Lok said that the preparatory work for the 2025 ECSS By-elections is ready and the staff members are carrying out final preparations and rehearsals. He thanked the staff members for their efforts so that the By-elections tomorrow would be conducted in an orderly and smooth manner.

There will be 28 candidates contesting a total of 21 seats in six subsectors in the By-elections. Five ordinary polling stations (OPSs) and one dedicated polling station at a police station will be set up for about 3 600 voters/authorised representatives (ARs) of the related subsectors. The polling hours will be from 9am to 6pm. Voters/ARs are reminded to bring the original of their valid Hong Kong identity card to vote at the designated polling station as specified on their poll card.

EAC members Professor Daniel Shek and Mr Bernard Man, SC, also visited the polling stations located at Wai Tsuen Sports Centre and Tiu Keng Leng Sports Centre this morning respectively. They then joined Mr Justice Lok in the CCS, who were accompanied by the Convenor and Members of the TAC, to inspect the on-site drill conducted by staff members to ensure a smooth operation of the counting work.

Mr Justice Lok added that the Electronic Poll Register System will continue to be used at OPSs for issuing ballot papers to voters/ARs, so that the issuance process can be conducted accurately and efficiently. Once the poll is closed, all ballot boxes will be delivered to the CCS at the HKCEC where counting of votes will take place. Candidates, election agents and counting agents may enter the CCS and observe the count at designated areas of the counting zone. Members of the public and media may also enter the public area of the CCS to observe the count.

The Registration and Electoral Office (REO)will also arrange for the Returning Officers to announce again the election results of each subsector on the stage of the Media Centre. Members of the public may observe the process from the designated public area at the Media Centre, which will accommodate approximately 200 seats. Admission will begin at 6pm on the polling day on a first-come, first-served basis until full capacity is reached. To facilitate admission control, all admitted members of the public will be required to wear a wristband provided by the REO for identification purpose.All election results will be published via press releases and the election website (www.elections.gov.hk).

 In addition, Mr Justice Lok and the Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Erick Tsang Kwok-wai, also accompanied the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, to visit the polling station at the Exhibition Gallery of Hong Kong Central Library this afternoon to inspect the final preparatory work including the set-up of the venue and rehearsals. The EAC and the REO are fully prepared on all fronts to ensure that the By-elections tomorrow would be conducted orderly and efficiently, in an open, honest and fair manner.
