"HKSAR Government extends gratitude to various governments, organisations, and all sectors of society for warm support for those affected by Wang Fuk Court fire in Tai Po",2025-12-26 17:47,2025-12-26 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/26/P2025122600491.htm,"A month has passed since the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has received condolences and support from various provinces and cities on the Chinese Mainland and from international counterparts. The HKSAR Government expresses its gratitude to the provincial and municipal governments of the Chinese Mainland, foreign governments, diplomatic missions, international organisations, consulates-general, honorary consulates, and officially recognised bodies in Hong Kong for their condolences and support for those affected by the fire through various channels, and thanks all sectors of Hong Kong society for their enthusiastic commitment to relief efforts and generous donations.

The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, said, ""On behalf of the HKSAR Government and all citizens of Hong Kong, I extend our heartfelt gratitude for the condolences, care, and assistance from our country and around the world. Fire shows no mercy, but the love of people abounds.This care, transcending geographical boundaries, reflects the spirit of solidarity and mutual support. We will continue to face challenges with resilience and love, transforming sorrow into strength and assisting those affected in returning to normal life as soon as possible.""

Mr Lee also expressed his gratitude to all sectors of Hong Kong society for their generous donations and active participation in relief efforts, covering areas such as accommodation, medical care, mental health, finance, and transport. These contributions have provided essential resources and support for post-disaster reconstruction and social recovery.

Following the fire, numerous charitable organisations and funds swiftly allocated donations to assist residents. The Government also established the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, which has so far received approximately $3.8 billion in donations. Together with the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the total fund has now reached around $4.1 billion. This fund provides various emergency financial support to various groups of people affected by the fire, including all residents, families of the deceased, hospitalised casualties, students, domestic helpers, workers, flat owners, and tenants.

Furthermore, many members of the public and organisations proactively donated supplies to address the immediate needs of the affected residents. In response, the Government and the information technology sector collaboratively established an online platform for donations of supplies. After assessing the actual needs of the residents, relevant government bureaux and departments and service organisations promptly distributed supplies, including food, beverages, clothing, personal care items, bedding, and electrical appliances, to support the residents' daily lives.

The HKSAR Government will continue to unite the strengths of all sectors, leading the community in its recovery and reforms with steadfast determination andaction, to jointly build a safer and better Hong Kong."

"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, dengue fever and chikungunya fever",2025-12-26 17:30,2025-12-26 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/26/P2025122600440.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (December 26) reported the latest situation of dengue fever (DF) and chikungunya fever (CF). The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, reminds the public that temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions (including neighbouring Southeast Asian countries) remain favourable for mosquito breeding. When travelling to areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, the public should take measures to prevent mosquito bites, including wearing loose, light-coloured, long-sleeved tops and trousers and applying insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or exposed parts of the body.

Dengue fever
----------------

  From December 19 to yesterday (December 25), the CHP recorded two imported DF case. The patient had travelled to the Philippines and Cambodia respectively during the incubation period.

  As of yesterday, 59 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. From January to July 2025, over four million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths have been reported in 97 countries/territories.

  DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India and Vietnam have each recorded over 100 000 cases so far this year; Malaysia and Thailand have each recorded over 40 000 cases; and Singapore has also recorded over 3 500 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded 3 579 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 21 cases were recorded in a week between December 1 and 7, with the highest number of cases recorded in Shantou and Chaozhou.

  Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHP'swebsite.

Chikungunya fever
-----------------------

  As of 5pm today, no new cases of CF had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported.

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

 The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding areas. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
  ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
蚊傳疾病登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的最新情況,2025-12-26 17:30,2025-12-26 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/26/P2025122600434.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月二十六日）公布登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的最新情況。中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區（包括鄰近東南亞國家）的氣溫仍然適合蚊媒滋生，市民前往受蚊傳疾病影響的地區，應採取措施防止被蚊叮咬，包括穿着寬鬆、淺色的長袖上衣及長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。

登革熱
———

​由十二月十九日至昨日（十二月二十五日），中心錄得兩宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期分別到過菲律賓及柬埔寨。

截至昨日，今年錄得59宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。世衞去年（二○二四年）錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。由二○二五年一月至七月，全球97個國家／地區呈報了超過400萬宗登革熱個案及超過3 000宗相關死亡個案。

CHP announces one new melioidosis case,2025-12-26 17:15,2025-12-26 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/26/P2025122600455.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (December 26) announced that one new melioidosis case was recorded in the past week (December 19 to 25). The CHP appealed to members of the public to maintain personal and environmental hygiene to prevent melioidosis. The CHP also specifically reminded high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water after typhoons or storms with a view to lowering infection risk.

The case involves a 36-year-old male with underlying illnesses living in Eastern district. He presented with a localised skin swelling since December 13. He attended Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on December 17 for follow up of his underlying illnesses, during which pus discharge was found from his skin swelling. He was then admitted for antibiotics treatment, and is currently in stable condition. The clinical diagnosis was a skin abscess. His clinical sample was confirmed to be positive for Burkholderia pseudomallei upon testing.

  The CHP is investigating the infection source of the case. Initial epidemiological investigations revealed that the case is sporadic. No epidemiological linkages have been established between this case and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of yesterday (December 25), 21 melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded.

Person-to-person transmission and animal-to-human transmission are rare, but the bacteria causing melioidosis can survive in the local environment. Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong, and melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year.

 According to literature, melioidosis cases are more common after typhoons or rainstorms. The bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei in soil and muddy water may become exposed to the ground after typhoons or rainstorms, and the bacteria could spread more easily with strong winds or rainstorms. As such, the number of melioidosis cases may increase.

 With this in mind, where practicable, members of the public should stay indoors during typhoons and rainstorms, avoid travelling to areas with potential flooding, and do not wade in or have contact with muddy water and soil. In addition, high-risk individuals should avoid paths near stormwater drains where aerosols may be generated from contaminated water.

 Members of the public should also take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. using gloves and wearing boots. High-risk individuals may also consider wearing a surgical mask;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover them with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soil or gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.

â
The CHP appealed to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromising conditions, in order to receive an appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment. For more information on melioidosis, please visit the website of the CHP atwww.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html."
衞生防護中心公布新增一宗類鼻疽個案,2025-12-26 17:15,2025-12-26 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/26/P2025122600454.htm,"​​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月二十六日）表示，過去一星期（十二月十九日至二十五日）錄得一宗新增類鼻疽個案。中心呼籲市民保持個人及環境衞生以預防類鼻疽，並特別提醒高風險群組，包括長者及長期病患者，在颱風或暴雨後應避免接觸土壤或泥水，減低感染風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的36歲男子。他居於東區，自十二月十三日起皮膚局部位置腫脹。他於十二月十七日到東區尤德夫人那打素醫院就自身長期病患就診，醫生發現其皮膚腫脹位置流出膿液，獲安排接受抗生素治療，目前情況穩定。病人的臨床診斷為皮膚膿腫，樣本經化驗證實對類鼻疽伯克氏菌呈陽性反應。

中心正調查個案的感染源頭，初步流行病學調查顯示，上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至昨日（十二月二十五日），本港今年錄得21宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。

導致類鼻疽的病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可存活於本地環境。類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得類鼻疽個案。

根據文獻，類鼻疽個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令病菌更容易散播，從而令類鼻疽個案有機會增加。

就此，颱風和暴雨期間市民應盡量留在室內，避免前往可能出現水浸的地區，亦不應涉水或接觸泥水和泥土。同時，高風險人士應避免使用雨水渠道附近的道路，以免接觸可能由污水產生的氣溶膠。

市民亦應採取以下措施預防感染：

• 避免接觸受污染的土壤；
• 進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿着適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴，高風險人士可考慮額外佩戴外科口罩；
• 接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
• 盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
• 接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
• 注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
• 外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。就更多有關類鼻疽的資料，市民可參閱中心網站www.chp.gov.hk/tc/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html。"

Mirs Bay in Hong Kong selected as Outstanding Example in fourth batch of national Beautiful Bays (with photos),2025-12-26 13:40,2025-12-26 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/26/P2025122400635.htm,"  The Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) recently announced the fourth batch of national ""Beautiful Bays"". Hong Kong's Mirs Bay has been selected as an ""Outstanding Example of Beautiful Bays"" with an excellent overall score. This marks the first time the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has received this commendation, highlighting the efforts of the HKSAR Government in marine ecological environment protection, and representing a significant achievement of the HKSAR Government in jointly building the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area into an international, first-class beautiful bay area.

  Located in the northeastern waters of Hong Kong, Mirs Bay presents a beautiful scene of ""clear water and clean beaches, thriving marine life, and harmonious coexistence between humans and the sea"". Its overall Water Quality Objectives compliance rate has reached 100 per cent, achieving Class I of the National Seawater Quality Standard. The bay's rich and diverse ecosystems are important habitats for various nationally protected wild animals, such as hard corals, seahorses, horseshoe crabs and white-bellied sea eagles. The bay area also features the Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark, Yan Chau Tong and Tung Ping Chau Marine Parks, etc, allowing the public to appreciate diverse ecological and geological wonders in the bay at close range and to experience the harmonious coexistence between humans and the sea.

  Furthermore, the HKSAR Government has been strengthening regional co-operation with the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Shenzhen Municipal Government, deepening exchanges on marine environmental and resource management in Mirs Bay. This collaboration promotes information sharing and emergency response co-ordination, jointly elevating the overall level of ecological environment management. The Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui, said that the environmental management of Mirs Bay fully embodies the concept of harmonious coexistence between humans and nature, providing an important reference for bay management in densely populated areas of the country. Taking this opportunity of Hong Kong's Mirs Bay being selected as an ""Outstanding Example of Beautiful Bays"", the HKSAR will share its experience in developing beautiful bays with coastal cities on the Chinese Mainland, jointly promoting marine ecological environment protection and sustainable development.

  The HKSAR Government will continue to enhance the quality of the marine ecological environment through the prevention and control of nearshore pollution, co-ordinated ecosystem protection and shoreline remediation, continuously advancing the building of ""Beautiful Bays"".

  The ""Outstanding Examples of Beautiful Bays"" is a campaign launched by the MEE to identify exemplary cases in the field of marine ecological environment protection. It aims to establish replicable and promotable models for comprehensive bay management and advance the vision of building a ""Beautiful China"". This round of the campaign received a total of 72 applications nationwide, with 32 bays designated as ""Beautiful Bays"", of which 12 (including Hong Kong's Mirs Bay) were selected as ""Outstanding Examples of Beautiful Bays"".

Interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements releases latest information on special boundary-crossing and corresponding public transport service arrangements during New Year's Eve and New Year holidays,2025-12-25 20:00,2025-12-25 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/25/P2025122500322.htm,"The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, released the following information today (December 25) on the special boundary-crossing and corresponding public transport service arrangements during New Year's Eve and the New Year holidays.

In view of a series of New Year's Eve countdown events, while the Hong Kong Port of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) and the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port (LMC/HG Port) will maintain 24-hour operations as usual, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government reached a consensus with the relevant departments of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen Municipality to make the following special boundary-crossing arrangements on New Year's Eve to facilitate cross-boundary passenger and vehicular movements:

(1) Passenger clearance services at the Lo Wu Control Point, which usually close at midnight, will be extended to 2am the next day. The operating hours of the MTR East Rail Line will be extended correspondingly, with the departure of the last East Rail Line train from Admiralty to Lo Wu extended to 12.56am; and

(2) Passenger and passenger vehicle clearance services at the Shenzhen Bay Port (SBP), which usually close at midnight, will operate overnight, providing round-the-clock services.

For more effective diversion of cross-boundary private cars on New Year's Day with the implementation of round-the-clock clearance at the SBP, only cross-boundary private cars issued with Closed Road Permits (Permits) for the LMC/HG Port are allowed to use the LMC/HG crossing. For cross-boundary private cars issued with Permits for SBP, LMC/HG, Heung Yuen Wai, Man Kam To Boundary Control Point (BCP) or Sha Tau Kok BCP, they can use the SBP during early-morning hours on New Year's Day.

For cross-boundary coaches, the HKSAR Government has also worked with cross-boundary coach service operators to arrange additional services using the SBP during early-morning hours on New Year's Day, and to enhance the services using the LMC/HG Port, including cross-boundary coaches departing from major stopping points in urban areas such as Wan Chai, Prince Edward and Jordan, as well as a shuttle bus running between the Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange and the LMC/HG Port (Yellow Bus), and the HZMB shuttle bus (Gold Bus). Moreover, a dedicated traffic lane section will be reserved for public transport services at the HZMB, LMC/HG Port, and SBP when necessary, to ensure the smooth operation of public transport services.

As regards local public transport services connecting to BCPs, to tie in with the special round-the-clock passenger clearance arrangements of the SBP on New Year's Day, franchised bus operators will operate two special overnight bus routes, Nos. NB2 and NB3, to provide services to and from Yuen Long/Tin Shui Wai and Tuen Mun respectively during the overnight period. Furthermore, in the case of travellers using overnight services of the MTR East Rail Line that night, after the closure of the Lo Wu Control Point, they may also take the specially arranged short-working bus service, route No. N73, from MTR Sheung Shui Station to Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange, and transfer to the Yellow bus for their journey to Shenzhen.

Residents and visitors may visit ""Easy Boundary"" (www.sb.gov.hk/eng/bwt/status.html?type=outbound), a one-stop information platform on immigration clearance launched by the Security Bureau, to obtain useful information in one go, including the respective average waiting time for passengers and private cars at land BCPs, as well as for the Gold Bus and Yellow Bus to plan their trips and save waiting time.

The Transport Department's Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre will operate 24 hours to closely monitor the traffic conditions and public transport services of various districts, the BCPs and major stations; implement contingency measures when necessary to meet service demands; and disseminate the latest traffic information through various channels.

""The full support and co-ordination of the leaders and relevant departments of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen Municipality are crucial to the implementation of the special boundary-crossing arrangements to facilitate the two-way flow of people between Hong Kong and the Mainland, reflecting the effective and close co-operation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen,"" the spokesman said.

The HKSAR Government will closely monitor the situation and take contingency actions promptly where necessary and deploy manpower flexibly to ensure orderly operations of the BCPs. The Government has formulated contingency plans for the peak periods of cross-boundary travel and made preparations for preventive and control measures to cater for different scenarios. Relevant bureaux and departments have formulated the plans below.

First, with the extension of operating hours at certain BCPs on New Year's Eve, the relevant departments have minimised leave for frontline officers for flexible manpower deployment. Additional counters, temporary counters and channels will be in operation to facilitate passenger and vehicular flow.

Second, the Inter-departmental Joint Command Centre set up by the Hong Kong Police Force, the Immigration Department, the Customs and Excise Department and other relevant departments will be activated from December 31, 2025 to January 4, 2026 to monitor the real-time situations at various BCPs and regularly report to the interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements, maintain close liaison with Mainland port authorities through the established port hotlines and real-time notification mechanism, and take timely contingency actions to flexibly deploy manpower at the BCPs to ensure smooth operation of the land control points.

Third, the Security Bureau will activate the Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre from December 31, 2025 to January 4, 2026 to closely monitor public order matters and co-ordinate any necessary actions at various BCPs, and support the working group in facilitating interdepartmental follow-up actions where necessary to respond promptly to various kinds of emergencies.

The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements is tasked with holistically co-ordinating and steering the preparatory work of various government departments for welcoming visitors to Hong Kong during the New Year's Eve and New Year holidays, as well as strengthening information dissemination to enable the public and visitors to plan their itineraries according to the latest situation."
特區政府節慶安排跨部門工作小組發放最新資訊：除夕及元旦特別通關及相應公共交通服務安排,2025-12-25 20:00,2025-12-25 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/25/P2025122500319.htm,"由政務司司長領導的節慶安排跨部門工作小組今日（十二月二十五日），就除夕及元旦期間的特別通關及相應公共交通服務安排，發放以下最新資訊：

因應除夕跨年倒數活動的舉行，除了港珠澳大橋香港口岸及落馬洲／皇崗口岸在除夕夜會如常二十四小時通關外，香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）與廣東省及深圳市相關部門達成共識，在除夕夜作出以下特別通關安排，以疏導跨境人流和車流：

（一）羅湖口岸的旅客清關服務由原來凌晨十二時關閉，延長至翌日凌晨二時，港鐵東鐵線會相應延長服務時間，由金鐘往羅湖方向的尾班車會延後至凌晨十二時五十六分開出；及

（二）深圳灣口岸的旅客和客車清關服務由原來凌晨十二時關閉，改為通宵服務，即二十四小時運作。

為更有效分流跨境私家車，在元旦日深圳灣口岸實施二十四小時通關期間，只有持落馬洲管制站封閉道路通行許可證（許可證）的跨境私家車可行走落馬洲／皇崗口岸；至於持有深圳灣口岸、落馬洲／皇崗、香園圍、文錦渡或沙頭角管制站相關許可證的跨境私家車，可在元旦日凌晨時段使用深圳灣口岸。

至於跨境巴士方面，特區政府與跨境巴士服務營辦商安排新增元旦日凌晨時段使用深圳灣口岸的服務，亦會加強使用落馬洲／皇崗口岸的服務，包括由市區主要站點例如灣仔、太子及佐敦等出發的跨境巴士，以及來往落馬洲（新田）公共運輸交匯處與落馬洲／皇崗口岸的穿梭巴士（皇巴）和港珠澳大橋穿梭巴士（金巴）。此外，在有需要時會於港珠澳大橋、落馬洲／皇崗及深圳灣口岸等地設立公共交通專用通道，保障公交服務暢順。

就接駁口岸的本地公共交通服務而言，為配合深圳灣口岸在元旦日二十四小時通關的特別安排，專營巴士營辦商會於凌晨時段營運第NB2號和NB3號兩條特別通宵巴士路線，分別提供往返元朗／天水圍和往返屯門的服務。另外，使用當晚通宵服務的港鐵東鐵線的旅客，在羅湖口岸關閉後，亦可在港鐵上水站乘搭特別開設的第N73號線短程巴士服務前往落馬洲（新田）公共運輸交匯處，換乘皇巴前往深圳。

市民及旅客可透過保安局的一站式過關資訊平台「口岸通」（www.sb.gov.hk/chi/bwt/status.html?type=outbound），取得各陸路邊境管制站旅客和私家車過關平均輪候時間，以及金巴和皇巴的平均輪候時間等有用資訊，以便計劃行程及減省等候時間。

運輸署的緊急事故交通協調中心二十四小時運作，密切監察全港各區、邊境管制站和主要車站的交通情況和公共運輸服務，適時採取措施，應對服務需求，並透過各種渠道發放最新的交通消息。

發言人指：「是次落實特別通關安排，便利兩地居民雙向奔赴，實有賴廣東省和深圳市的領導和相關部門的全力支持和配合，反映港深合作高效緊密。」 

特區政府會密切監察情況，有需要時作出迅速應變及靈活調配人手，確保口岸運作暢順。政府已為過關人流高峰期制定額外預案，並做好應對各種情況的準備及防控工作。相關政策局和部門已作出以下部署。

第一，為配合除夕夜個別口岸延長通關時間，口岸部門已減少前線人員休假，以便彈性調配人手，加開檢查櫃枱、臨時櫃枱及通道以疏導人流及車流。

第二，由香港警務處、入境事務處、香港海關及相關部門組成的跨部門聯合指揮中心，將於二○二五年十二月三十一日至二○二六年一月四日期間啓動，實時監察口岸現場情況及定時向節慶安排跨部門工作小組匯報，並與內地口岸部門透過已建立的口岸熱線及即時通報機制保持緊密聯繫，於有需要時迅速應變，靈活調配各管制站人員，確保口岸運作暢順。

第三，保安局亦會在二○二五年十二月三十一日至二○二六年一月四日期間啓動緊急事故監察及支援中心，密切監察及統籌各口岸的公眾秩序，並在有需要時支援工作小組以協調跨部門的跟進行動，迅速應對各種突發情況。

​節慶安排跨部門工作小組負責全面統籌並督導各政府部門有關除夕及元旦期間接待訪港旅客的預備工作，以及加強資訊發布，方便市民及旅客按最新情況規劃行程。"
