立法會十題：工業用水的供應,2025-10-08 15:40,2025-10-08 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800482.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上洪雯議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

近日有營運數據中心的業界人士向本人反映，將軍澳創新園（前稱將軍澳工業邨）的工業用水供應量不足，窒礙需要大量工業用水的產業的發展。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去10年，每年的工業用水量，以及其佔本港食水用量的比例為何；

（二）有否統計，過去10年由香港科技園公司管理的三個創新園（即大埔創新園、元朗創新園和將軍澳創新園）的用水量為何，以及有關用量佔本港整體工業用水量的比例分別為何；

（三）政府有否為各工業區及創新園的總體供水量，作出適當規劃，例如有否為各工業區及創新園設定供水量上限；

（四）鑑於政府於二○○六年開始在本港推行再造水試驗計劃，而據悉新加坡多年前已開始使用再造水作工業用途，本港現時再造水的工業應用範圍為何；有否計劃在創新園範圍推行再造水計劃；及

（五）鑑於本港正值新型工業化轉型期，不少數據中心、微電子行業、人工智能相關企業相繼落地，該等企業的特性是需要大量工業用水供冷卻系統運作，政府有否針對該等新興科企用水量的需求作出預測，以及有否制訂規劃方案，以應對未來工業用水量的持續上升？

答覆：

主席：

政府支援工業用水產業的發展，亦同時需要控制食水需求增長，措施包括積極鼓勵企業採用節水技術，及採用再造水及海水作工業用水用途，以提供穩定且經濟的水源。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢創新科技及工業局後，現回覆如下：

（一）過去10年，每年的工業及冷卻用水量，以及其佔本港食水用量的比例表列如下：

（三）水務設施的規劃和設計主要是為了滿足人口對飲用水的需求和工商業（包括工業區及創新園）的用水需求。就規劃個別發展地區供水系統的時候，水務署會根據相關政策局所估算的用水量以規劃所需要的供水系統。

政府會持續按各區的最新發展情況和規劃，檢視相關的用水需求，及評估供水系統承載力是否足夠，以確保向現有用戶和已納入未來發展規劃的新用戶提供穩定及可靠的供水。如有需要，政府會適時考慮推展供水系統升級工程以提升供水系統承載力，滿足地區預計的整體用水需求。當中會考慮預計用水需求及其時間表、技術可行性、成本效益、現有供水系統的承載力，及整體基建項目推行的優次等因素。

過去幾年，政府留意到現時有部分地區的用水需求已接近現有供水系統設計承載力的上限。若某用戶申請涉及大量用水，政府會向申請者提供技術建議，採取適當方案，例如採用海水及再造水，以滿足其用水需求。以將軍澳創新園為例，該創新園已興建海水區域供冷系統，以應付其用水需求的增長。

（四）政府一直積極探討由中央系統供應再造水，供現時使用臨時淡水沖廁的地區及位於內陸的新發展區域使用，以控制食水需求增長。為進一步控制食水需求增長，政府正探討在區域供冷系統中使用再造水的可行性。水務署初步確定以再造水運行蒸發式區域供冷系統大致可行，目前正進行試行項目，為日後的供冷系統項目提供參考。

在規劃供應再造水系統時，政府會按個別地區的實際情況，考慮成本效益及技術可行性等因素，包括建造和運作成本、沖廁水量的需求、供應地區附近是否有三級污水處理廠可提供經高度處理的排放水等。

因應石湖墟污水處理廠將會提升為三級處理的淨水設施，政府已在石湖墟興建首間再造水廠，把經過三級處理的排放水加工生產成再造水，並已於二○二四年三月開始分階段向上水和粉嶺部分地區供應再造水作沖廁用途。此外，政府計劃於元朗、元朗南及新田科技城興建再造水廠及相關設施，顧問正進行相關設計工作，現時預計於二○三三年開始陸續落成。

政府會繼續在技術可行和符合經濟效益的情況下擴大再造水的非飲用的用途，以控制食水需求增長，並會繼續推行已制訂的水資源策略，一方面鼓勵企業採用節水技術；另一方面開拓多元化的水資源，以支持香港各行各業的持續發展。

（五）政府推出了一系列的政策措施致力推進新型工業化，以及本港人工智能及數據科學產業發展。隨着更多企業來港發展和新產業落地，其所需的資源亦有可能隨之增加。政府在規劃工業及創科用地的時候，會進行可行性研究，預留並規劃提供相關的基建及設施（包括創科工業用水及冷卻用水），以配合創科發展。政府會繼續積極與相關創科機構保持密切溝通，持續完善基建配套設施，為這些企業提供所需要的支援（例如協助業界協調及聯繫相關政府部門）。"
LCQ10: Industrial water supply,2025-10-08 15:40,2025-10-08 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800487.htm,"âFollowing is a question by Dr the Hon Wendy Hong and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

 ââSome members of the industry operating data centres have recently relayed to me that the industrial water supply at Tseung Kwan O InnoPark (formerly known as Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate) is insufficient, hindering the development of industries that require substantial industrial water usage. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the annual industrial water consumption over the past decade, and its percentage share of Hong Kong's total fresh water consumption;

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the water consumption of the three InnoParks managed by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (namely Tai Po InnoPark, Yuen Long InnoPark and Tseung Kwan O InnoPark) over the past decade, and their respective percentage shares of Hong Kong's total industrial water consumption;

(3) whether the Government has made appropriate planning for the overall water supply to industrial areas and InnoParks, such as setting water supply caps for various industrial areas and InnoParks;

(4) given that the Government began implementing pilot schemes involving the use of reclaimed water in Hong Kong in 2006, and it is learnt that Singapore began using reclaimed water for industrial purposes years ago, of the current scope of industrial application of reclaimed water in Hong Kong; whether it has plans to implement schemes involving the use of reclaimed water in InnoParks; and

(5) given that Hong Kong is navigating through a period of new industrialisation, numerous data centres, microelectronics-related enterprises and artificial intelligence-related businesses are establishing their presence one after another, and that such enterprises typically require substantial industrial water supplies for operating cooling systems, whether the Government has forecast the water demand of these emerging technology enterprises and formulated planning proposals to address the anticipated sustained increase in industrial water consumption?

Reply:

President,

 ââThe Government supports the development of industries with industrial water usage on the one hand, while on the other hand contains fresh water demand growththrough various measures including actively encouraging enterprises to adopt water-saving technologies and to use reclaimed water and seawater for industrial purposes, thereby providing a stable and economical water supply.

 ââHaving consulted the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, our reply to the various parts of the question is set out below:

(1) Over the past decade, the annual industrial and cooling water consumption and its percentage share of Hong Kong's total fresh water consumption are listed in the following table:





			Year

(3) The planning and design of water supply facilities are primarily aimed to meet the population's demand for drinking water and water demand for industrial and commercial use (including industrial areas and InnoParks). During planning of the water supply system for individual development areas, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) will base on the water demands estimated by relevant policy bureaux to plan the required water supply system.

 ââThe Government will continuously review the relevant water demand of each district based on its latest development and planning, and assess the carrying capacity of the water supply system to ensure the provision of stable and reliable water supply to existing users and new users of future development. If necessary, the Government will consider implementing water supply system improvement projects in a timely manner to enhance the capacity of the water supply system to meet the projected overall water demand in the district with due consideration of the projected water demand and its timeline, technical feasibility, cost-effectiveness, the capacity of the existing water supply system, and the priority of overall infrastructure projects.

 ââIn the past few years, the Government has noted that the current water demands in some districts have approached the upper limit of the design capacity of the existing water supply systems. In the event that an applicant applies for large amount of water usage, the Government will provide technical advice to the applicant so appropriate scheme, such as adopting seawater and reclaimed water, could be effected to meet its water demand. For example, a seawater district cooling system has been constructed at the Tseung Kwan O InnoPark to meet its increasing water demand.

(4) The Government has been actively exploring the use of reclaimed water by providing a centralised reclaimed water supply system in those areas where fresh water is being temporarily used for flushing and in new development areas located in inland areas to contain the fresh water demand growth.To further contain the growth of fresh water demand, the Government is exploring the feasibility of using reclaimed water in district cooling systems. The WSD preliminarily considers that the use of reclaimed water for evaporative district cooling systems is generally feasible, and is currently conducting a pilot project to serve as a reference for future cooling system projects.

 In planning reclaimed water supply system, the Government will take into account the actual situation of the areas, considering factors such as cost-effectiveness and technical feasibility, including the construction and operational costs, flushing water demand, proximity to tertiary sewage treatment plants which can provide highly treated discharge water, etc.

 With the upgrading of Shek Wu Hui Sewage Treatment Works to an effluent polishing plant with tertiary treatment level, the Government has constructed the first water reclamation plant in Shek Wu Hui to further process tertiary treated effluent to reclaimed water.This water reclamation plant was commissioned in March 2024 and has begun to supply reclaimed water in phases to certain areas of Sheung Shui and Fanling for flushing purpose.In addition, the Government plans to construct reclaimed water plants and the associated facilities in Yuen Long, Yuen Long South, and the San Tin Technopole. The consultants are currently carrying out the relevant design work. At present, it is anticipated that the reclaimed water plants will be completed progressively starting from 2033.

 Provided that it is technically feasible and economically viable, the Government will continue to expand the application of reclaimed water to other non-potable uses, in order to contain the growth of fresh water demand. The Government will also continue to implement the formulated water resources strategies, encouraging enterprises to adopt water-saving technologies on the one hand, and developing diversified water resources on the other hand, to support the sustainable development of all sectors in Hong Kong.

(5) The Government has rolled out a series of policies and measures to advance new industrialisation and foster the development of AI and data science industries in Hong Kong. As more enterprises and new industries establish a presence in Hong Kong, the demand for resources is expected to grow. In planning industrial land and land for innovation and technology, the Government will carry out feasibility studies, allocate and plan for the necessary infrastructure and facilities (including water for innovative industries process and cooling), to cope with the development of innovations and technologies. The Government will continue to engage closely with the relevant innovation and technology organisations, continue to enhance infrastructure and ancillary facilities, and provide necessary supports for these enterprises (for example, assistance in coordination and liaison with relevant Government departments)."
立法會二題：招商引資的工作,2025-10-08 15:35,2025-10-08 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800472.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上蘇長荣議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的書面答覆：

問題：

由廣東省、香港和澳門三地政府於去年在廣州共同舉辦的粵港澳大灣區全球招商大會（招商大會），成為粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）城市攜手招商引資的有效渠道和重要平台。據報去年的招商大會取得了亮麗成績，共吸引430多名來自世界500強和行業龍頭企業的代表參與，簽訂的總投資額達到2.26萬億元人民幣。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據報招商大會將於每年的十一月八日定期舉辦，今年的招商大會將於哪個城市舉行；有否預計將邀請多少間外國和香港企業參加；特區政府會如何協助港企爭取新的投資及貿易項目；

（二）據報在去年招商大會共簽訂1 933項投資項目，當中香港有參與的投資項目為何；

（三）鑑於投資推廣署與內地對口單位成立「泛大灣區外來投資聯絡小組」，過去一年，該小組舉辦了多少項推介和其他招商引資活動；及

（四）會否考慮聯同大灣區其他內地城市到海外（例如中東及東南亞國家聯盟國家）舉辦招商引資活動？

答覆：

主席：

一直以來，投資推廣署在進行招商引資的工作時，均積極配合不同政策局推廣有利營商的政策，包括配合政制及內地事務局（政制局）宣傳粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）發展的相關機遇。投資推廣署亦與機構、商會、專業團體等合作，在內地及海外舉辦和贊助一系列投資推廣活動，包括路演、研討會、圓桌會議等，為企業提供香港營商環境的最新資訊，例如我們在「一國兩制」下的核心優勢和大灣區發展等國家重點戰略帶來的機遇，以吸引和鼓勵企業在香港開設或擴展業務。

就蘇長荣議員的提問，經諮詢政制局後，我綜合回應如下：

在政制局的支持下，投資推廣署於二○二一年與大灣區的相關部門成立「泛大灣區外來投資聯絡小組」（聯絡小組），透過制定聯合推廣建議和材料、聯合組織活動等，加強合作和協同效應。聯絡小組自二○二二年起每年在廣州舉辦粵港澳大灣區全球招商大會（全球招商大會），由粵港澳三地政府聯合向全球企業重點展示大灣區最新階段的建設成果及投資潛力。二○二五年的全球招商大會將於十一月三日在廣州舉行，並預計會邀請多間跨國和香港企業共約400名代表參加。特區政府會繼續在全球招商大會上積極推廣香港的營商優勢，吸引更多投資項目落戶香港。

在上述的全球招商大會中，投資推廣署接觸了不少有興趣來港設立或擴展業務的內地及海外企業，並按它們的需要提供一站式支援服務，發揮香港作為雙向跳板的獨特優勢。去年，全球招商大會簽訂超過1 900項投資項目，包括投資推廣署在內的聯絡小組積極跟進協助有關投資項目落地。由二○二四年至今年八月，投資推廣署共協助了983間內地及海外企業在香港開設或擴展業務，當中492間是海外企業，而超過120間是來自大灣區城市的內地企業。

除了舉辦全球招商大會外，聯絡小組亦會每年到海外舉辦招商引資活動，向當地企業推廣大灣區的最新政策措施及發展機遇。在二○二三及二○二四年，粵港澳三地政府分別於德國慕尼黑及法國巴黎聯合舉辦經貿合作交流會，向歐洲企業推介大灣區的投資環境及發展機遇；今年，三地政府再次拼船出海到匈牙利布達佩斯及埃及開羅舉辦投資推廣活動，推廣大灣區建設為歐洲及非洲商界發展帶來的商機，以及香港在「一國兩制」下作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的獨特角色與功能，並鼓勵企業落戶香港，開拓大灣區的龐大市場。

此外，投資推廣署亦在內地城市舉辦投資推廣活動，一直積極向內地企業介紹香港的營商優勢和機遇，以鼓勵當地企業來港投資並經香港發展國際業務。在二○二五年，該署已在寧波、濟南、武漢、青島、成都、廣州、北京、天津和瀋陽等地舉行多場推廣活動。

展望未來，投資推廣署會繼續配合政制局，並與聯絡小組成員保持緊密聯繫，共同推進大灣區相關的招商引資工作，一方面向海外企業推廣香港作為拓展大灣區業務的跳板並支援它們落戶香港，另一方面向大灣區企業推廣香港作為「出海」的跳板並支援它們落戶香港，而相關工作亦會與行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》中公布內地企業出海專班的工作有機結合，進一步驅動「引進來、走出去」的雙向投資。聯絡小組亦會繼續積極計劃到其他有潛力的新興市場進行推廣和招商工作，進一步彰顯香港作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色。"
LCQ2: Efforts to attract investment,2025-10-08 15:35,2025-10-08 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800473.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon So Cheung-wing and a written reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

 The Global Investment Promotion Conference for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Conference), jointly hosted by the governments of Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and Macao in Guangzhou last year, has become as an effective channel and important platform for cities within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to collaborate in investment attraction efforts. It has been reported that the Conference achieved remarkable results last year, drawing the participation of over 430 representatives from Fortune Global 500 companies and top-notch enterprises in the industries, with total investment commitments amounting to RMB2.26 trillion. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is reported that the Conference will be held annually as a regular event on November 8, of the city which will host the Conference this year; whether an estimate is made on the number of foreign and Hong Kong enterprises to be invited; how the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will assist Hong Kong enterprises in securing new investment and trade projects;

(2) among the 1 933 investment projects reportedly signed at last year's Conference, of those involving the participation of Hong Kong;

(3) given that Invest Hong Kong and its Mainland counterpart have established the Pan-Greater Bay Area Inward Investment Liaison Group, of the number of promotional and other investment attraction activities organised by the Group over the past year; and

(4) whether it will consider organising overseas (such as in the Middle East and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries) investment attraction activities in collaboration with other Mainland cities in the GBA?

Reply:

President,

 Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) has all along been proactively working with various policy bureaux to promote business-friendly policies in its investment promotion work, including working with the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau (CMAB) on initiatives relating to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) development. In addition, InvestHK collaborates with organisations, chambers of commerce and professional bodies, etc, to organise and sponsor an array of investment promotion activities on the Mainland and overseas, including roadshows, seminars and roundtables, to provide enterprises with the latest information on Hong Kong's business environment, including our core advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle and opportunities arising from key national strategies such as the GBA development, thereby attracting and encouraging enterprises to set up or expand their businesses in Hong Kong.

 After consulting the CMAB, my consolidated response to Dr the Hon So Cheung-wing's question is as follows:

 With the support of the CMAB, the Pan-Greater Bay Area Inward Investment Liaison Group (Liaison Group) was established in 2021 by InvestHK and relevant GBA counterparts. Through developing joint propositions and promotion materials as well as organising joint events, the Liaison Group enhances collaboration and synergy among members of the Liaison Group. Since 2022, the governments of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have been jointly organising annually the Global Investment Promotion Conference for the GBA (Conference) in Guangzhou to showcase to global strategic enterprises the latest developments and investment potential of the GBA. The 2025 Conference will be held in Guangzhou on November 3, with participation by around 400 representatives from multinational and Hong Kong enterprises. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will continue to proactively promote Hong Kong's business advantages at the Conference to attract more investment projects to land in Hong Kong.

 At the past Conferences, InvestHK engaged with many Mainland and overseas enterprises which were interested in setting up or expanding their businesses in Hong Kong and provided them with one-stop customised support services based on their needs, fully leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages as a two-way springboard. Last year, over 1 900 investment projects were signed during the Conference. The Liaison Group, with InvestHK being one of its members, is proactively following up and assisting in the implementation of these projects. From 2024 to August this year, InvestHK assisted 983 Mainland and overseas companies in setting up or expanding their businesses in Hong Kong, including 492 overseas companies and over 120 Mainland companies from GBA cities.

 Apart from organising the Conference, the Liaison Group also hosts overseas investment promotion events annually to promote to local businesses the latest policies and development opportunities in the GBA. In 2023 and 2024, the governments of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao jointly hosted the economic and trade co-operation conferences in Munich, Germany, and Paris, France, to promote the GBA's investment environment and development opportunities to European enterprises. This year, the governments of the three regions again jointly held investment promotion events in Budapest, Hungary, and Cairo, Egypt, to promote to the European and African business communities the business opportunities brought by the GBA development, as well as Hong Kong's unique roles and functions as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"" under the ""one country, two systems"" principle. The events also encouraged businesses to establish presence in Hong Kong and tap into the vast market of the GBA.

 In addition, InvestHK has been organising investment promotion activities in various Mainland cities to proactively introduce Hong Kong's business advantages and opportunities to Mainland enterprises, so as to encourage them to invest in Hong Kong and expand international businesses via the city. In 2025, the department organised multiple promotional activities in Ningbo, Jinan, Wuhan, Qingdao, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Tianjin and Shenyang, etc.

 Looking ahead, InvestHK will continue to work with the CMAB and maintain close liaison with members of the Liaison Group to jointly take forward the investment promotion efforts related to the GBA. On the one hand, InvestHK will promote Hong Kong as a springboard for overseas businesses looking to expand into the GBA and support them to set up their operations here. On the other hand, we will also promote Hong Kong to GBA enterprises as a launchpad for going global and assist them in establishing presence in Hong Kong. The efforts will be organically integrated into the work of the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global announced by the Chief Executive in his 2025 Policy Address, thereby enhancing two-way investment (viz. attracting investment inflows to Hong Kong and facilitating further investment beyond Hong Kong). Besides, the Liaison Group will also continue to proactively plan promotional and investment activities in other potential emerging markets to further highlight Hong Kong's roles as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder""."
行政長官在香港航商總會一週年慶典致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-10-08 15:30,2025-10-08 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800470.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十月八日）在香港航商總會一週年慶典的視像致辭：

尊敬的梁振英副主席（全國政協副主席）、祁斌副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、李永勝副特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署副特派員）、趙式慶主席（香港航商總會主席）、各位嘉賓、各位航運界的朋友：

大家好！很高興通過視頻，和大家一同慶祝香港航商總會成立一周年。

國家《十四五規劃綱要》明確支持香港提升國際航運中心地位。香港在「一國兩制」下擁有「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的獨特優勢，加上國際化的營商環境，以及專業高效的航運服務體系，已經連續六年穩居全球第四大國際航運中心的地位，充分反映了我們在港口條件、專業海運服務、整體營商環境等的綜合實力雄厚。

近年，地緣政治局勢持續緊張，貿易格局和全球供應鏈正在重塑，全球航運業正面臨風高浪急的挑戰。然而，香港航運業展現了無比的韌力，在風浪中穩步前行。

面對變局，政府和業界並肩同行。我們積極推動航運業發展，已先後在二○二三和二○二四年公布了《海運及港口發展策略行動綱領》和《綠色船用燃料加注行動綱領》，為行業發展勾劃了清晰藍圖。

今年七月，我們成立了香港海運港口發展局，匯聚業界智慧，與政府攜手推動航運港口業多元和持續發展。

我在上個月發表的新一份《施政報告》，提出多項措施，以進一步鞏固香港國際航運中心地位。我們會建立通達內陸的「鐵海陸江」立體聯運體系，積極拓展貨源；建立國際「伙伴港口」網絡，深化國際航運網絡交往。

我們會全力推動港口綠色化和數字化；並透過修例，增加船舶註冊的靈活性，加強電子化。我們也將為大宗商品貿易商落戶香港提供半稅優惠，帶動更多的需求。這些措施將進一步全面提升香港航運業的競爭力。

挑戰，是航行者衝破雲霧之風；機遇，是留給早已備好帆的船。我相信，航運業面對的機遇大於挑戰，我對香港的航運實力和廣闊前景，有堅定信心。

我期待香港航商總會繼續凝聚業界，與政府攜手推動行業高質量發展。我們共同努力，香港航運業必能乘風破浪，開拓新藍海，為國家建設海洋強國與交通強國作出更大貢獻。

最後，我祝願香港航商總會會務蒸蒸日上，在座各位工作順利。謝謝大家。"

LCQ13: Barrier-free facilities in public housing,2025-10-08 14:47,2025-10-08 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800371.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Yang Wing-kit and a written reply by the Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, in the Legislative Council today (Oct 8):

Question:

 Residents of certain aged public housing estates (including public rental housing (PRH) estates under the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) and rental estates under the Hong Kong Housing Society (HS)) have relayed that there is a lack of adequate barrier-free access and facilities within their estates, which is non-conducive to the mobility of the elderly and persons with impaired mobility. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the plans of the HA and HS to enhance barrier-free access and facilities in their aged PRH estates and rental estates (including the progress of ongoing projects); and

(2) as it is learnt that the staircase connecting Kau Pui Lung Road to Blocks A to E of Lok Man Sun Chuen under the HS serves as an essential access route to and from the estate, while there are views pointing out that this access route lacks barrier-free facilities, thereby causing inconvenience to the elderly and persons with impaired mobility in their daily access, whether the Government will urge the HS to construct an access ramp or install a lift at the relevant location in Lok Man Sun Chuen to address this issue; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 In response to the question raised by the Hon Yang Wing-kit, our reply is as follows:

(1) The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) endeavours to enhance barrier-free access and facilities in public rental housing (PRH) estates to meet the needs of PRH residents and users, particularly the elderly and persons with disabilities.

 It is the established policy of the HA to provide barrier-free access and facilities in accordance with the prevailing requirements as set out in the ""Design Manual: Barrier Free Access"" (DM), wherever practicable. In response to the introduction of the ""DM 1997"" and ""DM 2008"", the HA undertook necessary barrier-free facilities improvement works in 2001 and 2010 respectively for the premises that were completed prior to the publication of the DM. These improvement works included provision of ramps, installation of suitable handrails at access routes, provision and extension of tactile guide paths connecting the main entrances of the estates to major facilities within the estates and entrances of residential blocks, etc. However, some buildings may not be able to fully install relevant facilities or undergo modifications due to various constraints, such as building design. For all new HA buildings with construction commenced after December 1, 2008, and when existing HA buildings undergo alternations and additional works, the planning and implementation of works shall comply with the mandatory requirements as stipulated in ""DM 2008"" as far as practicable. In order to address the residents' diverse needs, the HA also makes flexible arrangements. For example, we are currently installing more accessible ramps in aged PRH estates including Ping Shek Estate, Wo Che Estate and Sha Kok Estate, to connect major facilities within the estates to facilitate residents' access. The HA has adopted the concept of ""Universal Design"" in new public housing estates to create an inclusive and harmonious living environment for people with different physical abilities.

 Moreover, in order to enhance the co-ordination of barrier-free initiatives in the public housing estates, the HA has launched the Access Co-ordinator and Access Officer Scheme since 2011. Access Officers stationed in various PRH estates are responsible for assisting individuals with needs in using the barrier-free access and facilities in the PRH estates.

 In addition to the provision of barrier-free facilities in common areas, the elderly or persons with disabilities can apply to the HA for adaptation works on facilities in the PRH flats if they have genuine needs. With reference to the advice from doctors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists or medical social workers, etc, the HA will carry out adaptation works free of charge for the tenants concerned. These works include installing ramp at the entrance of the flat where feasible, widening bathroom doorways, laying anti-skid floor tiles on suitable floor surface, etc. If tenants only request installing grab bars or converting a bathtub into a shower area in the bathroom, in general, the HA will directly arrange the relevant works for the tenant free of charge, without the need for tenant to seek advice from doctors or physiotherapists.

 As regards the Hong Kong Housing Society (HS), in response to the challenge of ""double ageing"", i.e. both the rental estates and residents are growing older, the HS has been continuously deploying resources in major improvement projects to enhance the accessibility of the buildings and public areas across its estates and add barrier-free facilities. Such efforts include adding lifts and transfer escalators, installing stairlifts, constructing transfer lift towers and connecting footbridge, etc. In addition, the HS has replaced over 70 lifts in its aged rental estates over the past decade and plans to progressively carry out lift replacement for other suitable aged rental estates. Moving forward, the HS will continue to assess the condition of its rental estates and explore introducing or enhancing barrier-free access and facilities where feasible and suitable.

(2) HS's Lok Man Sun Chuen, comprising 11 blocks, was completed in phases between 1970 and 1973. Six of these blocks (Blocks A to F) were built along a hilly slope, with Block F situated at a higher elevation. For the convenience of the residents, the HS completed the construction of a transfer lift tower and a footbridge connecting to Block F, as well as a covered walkway in 2014. Residents may take the lift to Block F through the level entrance on Kau Pui Lung Road beneath Block F, then descend to Blocks A to E, without having to walk uphill via the estate's main entrance on Kau Pui Lung Road.

 Currently, residents of Blocks A to E are still required to use staircases to reach the entrance of their respective blocks. To address this, the HS has commissioned an engineering consultant, who is now conducting a feasibility study on adding barrier-free access (such as ramps or lifts) at suitable locations across Blocks A to E, taking into account factors such as the site's geological conditions and the potential impact of the works on the residents' daily lives.

 In addition, the HS has also engaged a start-up to develop relevant PropTech solutions to assist residents in transporting heavy items such as rice, cooking oil and other daily necessities up and down staircases, further strengthening support for the residents.

 With regard to various facilities in the public housing estates, the HA and HS will continue to actively engage in communication and research with local communities/individuals as well as residents within the estates to explore ways to enhance these facilities, and address the needs of various persons in the estates, including the elderly and persons with disabilities."
立法會九題：促進私募基金的發展,2025-10-08 14:45,2025-10-08 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800268.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上李惟宏議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

政府在二○二四年《施政報告》中表示會促進私募基金透過香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）開拓新銷售渠道；而二○二五至二六‍年度《財政預算案》進一步提到，為促進更多私募基金在港上市，證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）已釐清相關監管規定，鼓勵具規模、持續產生穩定收入的另類資產基金集資。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否促請證監會及港交所合作，盡早落實相關規管政策的細節，例如制訂估值標準、設立審批快速通道等，以促進更多私募基金透過有限合夥基金形式在港上市；

（二）為吸引更多海外大型私募基金來港上市，政府會否考慮提供稅務優惠，以及促請港交所降低有關上市費用；

（三）會否加強與強制性公積金計劃管理局（積金局）的合作，制訂有關強制性公積金（強積金）資產投資於上市私募基金的指引，並為該等基金明確劃分風險評級（例如低、中及高風險等），以便日後強積金受託人可根據其投資政策投資於合適的私募基金；及

（四）會否聯同證監會、港交所及積金局，推出針對私募基金投資者教育的措施（例如舉辦研討會及制訂風險披露手冊等），以提高零售及機構投資者對上市私募基金的認識，從而促進私募基金業務的發展？

答覆:

主席：

就問題的各部分，經諮詢證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及其轄下的投資者及理財教育委員會（投委會）、強制性公積金計劃管理局（積金局），以及香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所），現回覆如下。

（一）政府致力推動金融市場發展。《行政長官2024年施政報告》提出，政府會推動更多環球資金在港管理，包括促進私募基金透過港交所開拓新銷售渠道。

就認可擬於港交所上市的基金，證監會於二○二五年二月發出通函，釐清當中有關主要投資於私募及流通性較低資產的封閉式基金的規定，以鼓勵具規模，尤其是能持續產生穩定收入的另類資產基金（包括私募基金，下同）在港上市。相關規定已在通函及證監會《單位信託及互惠基金守則》內列出，包括對管理公司勝任能力和經驗的要求、基金應投資於足夠分散的另類資產投資組合、基金分派政策、估值以及於銷售文件中的披露。鑑於另類資產種類繁多，證監會可視乎基金的性質及投資策略施加額外條件、修改規定，或就遵守某些要求作出靈活安排。

證監會一直與業界保持溝通，並與有興趣的基金經理就其初步提出的上市另類資產基金建議進行討論。據證監會了解，這些基金準備以公司形式或單位信託基金形式設立，並主要投資於私募股權、私募信貸及基礎設施債務。

根據證監會與業界的討論，證監會認為目前上市另類資產基金宜採用現有的公募基金架構。這些架構為香港零售投資者所熟悉及理解，並根據《單位信託及互惠基金守則》設有完善的投資者保障措施及監管規定。證監會將繼續探討另類資產基金以有限合夥形式上市的可行性。

（二）政府致力締造有利業界的税務環境，以吸引更多基金在香港落戶及營運。在現行的稅制下，向公眾發售的基金已可獲豁免繳付利得税。此外，《2021年税務（修訂）（附帶權益的税務寬減）條例》自二○二一年五月生效，為在香港營運的合資格私募基金所分發的附帶權益提供税務寬減。政府將爭取於二○二六年上半年向立法會提交條例草案，進一步優化基金、單一家族辦公室和附帶權益的優惠税制，當中包括優化私募基金分發附帶權益的税務寬減安排，以吸引更多私募基金落戶香港。

符合資格獲證監會認可並通過《上市規則》在港上市的基金在管理資產金額和業務都有一定規模，應有足夠資源應付申請上市的相關費用。港交所收取的上市費用只佔上市成本的小部分。港交所和證監會將不時檢討港交所的相關收費標準，確保其與其他主要市場相比具競爭力。

（三）為提升強制性公積金（強積金）基金經風險調整的回報潛力，政府和積金局一直致力檢視和擴闊強積金可投資的資產類別。考慮到容許強積金投資於私募股權有助加強強積金分散投資和提升其回報潛力，積金局於二○二五年五月向業界公布，符合準則的上市私募基金經積金局個別核准後，可納入為強積金基金的准許資產類別。考慮到上市私募基金相比傳統投資選項具有較高風險，強積金基金可投資於獲核准的上市私募基金的總額，限於該基金淨資產值的百分之十，以保障計劃成員的利益。

強積金基金的投資經理應視乎基金的投資政策和目標，就進行有關投資作出專業決定。積金局目前沒有計劃為獲核准的上市私募基金訂定風險評級，但會密切留意情況，並與業界保持溝通。現時未有上市私募基金被納入為強積金基金的准許資產類別，積金局會在核准首隻上市私募基金後修訂相關指引，便利投資經理作出投資決定。

（四）政府一直支持證監會及轄下的投委會，透過不同形式和渠道進行投資者教育工作。證監會將與投委會緊密合作，發布一般性的投資者教育資料，闡釋與上市另類資產基金相關的投資機遇和風險，協助投資者作出有根據的投資決定。就個別另類資產基金產品而言，如通函所述，證監會預期認可上市另類資產基金的管理公司於香港推出基金前，需進行廣泛的投資者教育。積金局亦會繼續推廣強積金教育，透過各項活動和渠道加強計劃成員對強積金投資選項的認識。"
LCQ9: Promoting development of private equity funds,2025-10-08 14:45,2025-10-08 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800286.htm,"  Following is a question by Hon Robert Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  The Government stated in the 2024 Policy Address that it would facilitate the opening of new distribution channels for private equity (PE) funds through the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX); and the 2025-26 Budget further mentioned that in order to facilitate more PE funds to list in Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) had clarified the relevant regulatory requirements to encourage sizeable alternative asset funds with regular income streams to raise funds. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will urge SFC and HKEX to work together on finalising the details of the relevant regulatory policies as soon as possible, such as establishing valuation standards, setting up a fast-track approval mechanism, etc., to facilitate the listing of more PE funds in the form of limited partnership funds in Hong Kong;

(2) whether, to attract more large overseas PE funds to list in Hong Kong, the Government will consider offering tax incentives and urge HKEX to reduce relevant listing fees;

(3) whether it will enhance collaboration with the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) to formulate guidelines for investing Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) assets in listed PE funds and clearly assign risk ratings (e.g. low, medium or high risk) to such funds so that MPF trustees can invest in suitable PE funds in accordance with their investment policies in the future; and

(4) whether it will introduce measures in collaboration with SFC, HKEX and MPFA on investor education on PE funds, such as organising seminars and developing risk disclosure handbooks, to raise the awareness of listed PE funds among retail and institutional investors, thereby promoting the development of PE fund business?

President,

  In consultation with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and its subsidiary, the Investor and Financial Education Council (IFEC), the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), the reply to the various parts of the question is as follows.

(1) The Government is committed to promoting the development of the financial markets. ""The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address"" announced that the Government would attract more global capital to be managed in Hong Kong, including facilitating the opening of new distribution channels for private equity funds (PE funds) through the HKEX's listing.

  In respect of authorising funds which seek a listing on the HKEX, the SFC issued a circular in February 2025 to clarify the regulatory requirements in relation to closed-ended funds that invest mainly in private and less liquid assets, thereby encouraging sizeable alternative asset funds (including PE funds, same hereinafter), preferably those with regular income streams, to list in Hong Kong. Relevant requirements have been included in the circular and the SFC's Code on Unit Trusts and Mutual Funds, including requirements on the management company's competence and experience, investments in a well-diversified portfolio of alternative assets, distribution policy, valuation and disclosure in offering documents. Due to a wide array of alternative assets available, the SFC may impose additional conditions, modify requirements, or allow flexibility in compliance with certain requirements, having regard to the fund's nature and investment strategy.

  The SFC has been in ongoing engagement with the industry, and has been in discussions with interested fund managers on their preliminary proposals for listed alternative asset funds. According to the SFC's understanding, these funds are planned to be structured in corporate or unit trust form, primarily investing in private equity, private credit and infrastructure debt.

  Based on the SFC's discussion with the industry, the SFC is of the view that, at the moment, it would be preferable for listed alternative asset funds to adopt existing public fund structures. These structures are familiar to and well understood by retail investors in Hong Kong, and there are comprehensive investor protection measures and regulatory requirements under the Code on Unit Trusts and Mutual Funds. The SFC will continue to explore the feasibility of the listing of alternative asset funds in limited partnership form.

(2) The Government is committed to providing a facilitative tax environment for the industry to attract more funds to set up and operate in Hong Kong. Under the prevailing tax regime, publicly offered funds are already exempt from profits tax. In addition, the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (Tax Concessions for Carried Interest) Ordinance 2021 has been effective from May 2021, providing tax concessions for carried interest distributed by eligible PE funds operating in Hong Kong. The Government will endeavour to introduce a bill into the Legislative Council in the first half of 2026 to further enhance the preferential tax regimes for funds, single-family offices and carried interest, including enhancing the tax concession arrangement on the distribution of carried interest by PE funds, so as to attract more PE funds to set up in Hong Kong.

  Funds that are eligible to be authorised by the SFC and listed in Hong Kong under the Listing Rules should have sizeable asset under management and business operations, and they should have sufficient resources to cover the relevant costs of applying for listing. The listing fee collected by the HKEX only makes up a small proportion of the expenses associated with listing. The HKEX and the SFC will review the level of relevant fees under the HKEX from time to time so as to ensure their levels would be competitive as compared to other major markets.

(3) To enhance the risk-adjusted return potential of Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) funds, the Government and the MPFA have been committed to reviewing and broadening the MPF permissible asset classes. Having considered the potential benefits of allowing MPF investment in private equity to enhance diversification and return potential, the MPFA announced to the industry in May 2025 that listed PE funds meeting the relevant criteria and approved by the MPFA on a case-by-case basis can be included as a permissible underlying asset class for MPF funds. In view of the higher risks associated with listed PE funds as compared with traditional investment options, the total amount that an MPF fund can invest in approved listed PE funds is limited to 10 per cent of the fund's net asset value to safeguard the interests of scheme members.

  Investment managers of MPF funds should make professional decisions on whether to make relevant investment with due regard to the MPF fund's investment policy and objective. The MPFA currently has no plan to assign risk ratings to approved listed PE funds, but will closely monitor the situation and maintain dialogue with the industry. There are currently no listed PE funds included as permissible asset class for MPF funds. The MPFA will revise the relevant guidelines upon the approval of the first listed PE fund to facilitate investment decisions of investment managers.

(4) The Government has been supporting the SFC and its subsidiary, the IFEC, in carrying out investor education work through various means and channels. The SFC will work closely with the IFEC to issue general investor education materials to explain the investment opportunities and risks in respect of listed alternative asset funds, in order to help investors make informed investment decisions. For specific alternative asset fund products, as set out in the circular, the management company of an SFC-authorised listed alternative asset fund is expected to carry out extensive investor education before launching the fund in Hong Kong. The MPFA will also continue to promote MPF education through various activities and channels, with a view to enhancing scheme members' understanding of MPF investment options."
​立法會四題：為來港參與短期活動的訪客提供便利,2025-10-08 14:42,2025-10-08 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800366.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上霍啟剛議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見指出，政府推出的「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（該計劃）旨在提供入境便利安排予獲認可主辦機構邀請或保證來港參與有利香港發展的短期活動訪客，讓他們在以訪客身分逗留期間，參與12個指定界別下的指定活動，對推動香港建設「八大中心」具積極意義。然而，有意見指出二○二五至二○二六財政年度的《財政預算案》提出增設各項人才入境計劃的申請費並上調簽證費，對未獲納入為該計劃獲認可主辦機構名單的機構（非認可機構）造成成本壓力。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年透過該計劃來港的訪客所獲批准參與的活動數目，並按活動類別、活動的舉行天數（即一天至三天、四天至七天、八天至10天，以及10天以上）和指定界別列出分項數字；

（二）自增設人才入境計劃的申請費和上調簽證費後，政府有否評估有關安排對非認可機構所造成的財務負擔，以及其舉辦活動數目的影響，包括因簽證成本造成財務壓力而取消的活動數目；如有，結果為何；

（三）鑑於有業界人士反映，機構須為獲邀來港參與不屬該計劃指定界別活動的短期訪客申請工作簽證，因應簽證成本上升或需減少舉辦國際交流活動，政府有何具體措施支援該等機構，例如設立費用較低的超短期工作簽證及簡化簽證申請程序等；

（四）為確保該計劃持續切合業界需要，政府有否設立定期檢討機制，包括諮詢相關界別代表以更新認可主辦機構名單；會否加強向業界宣傳該計劃內容，明確說明申請人士的資格和條件，以及各個指定界別活動的具體要求；及

（五）鑑於有意見認為，該計劃下「文化藝術」界別的認可主辦機構只有四個（包括文化體育及旅遊局、康樂及文化事務署、香港藝術發展局及西九文化區管理局），導致許多文化藝術團體難以受惠於該計劃，有違計劃初衷，政府會否檢討認可主辦機構的甄選機制，包括擴大文化藝術界別的認可主辦機構範圍至其他具認受性的藝術團體；如會，詳情及時間表為何？

答覆︰

主席：

為促進更多人才訪港交流，政府於二○二二年六月推出為期兩年的「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利先導計劃」（先導計劃），並於二○二四年六月把先導計劃恆常化為「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（短期訪客計劃）。在短期訪客計劃下，獲政府相關決策局／部門認可的機構可向界別內相關的非本地人才發出邀請信，獲邀人士可以訪客身分來港參與指定短期活動，而無須向入境事務處（入境處）申請工作簽證／進入許可。他們每次來港可在不超過連續14個曆日期間參與指定短期活動，並可就該指定活動收取報酬。

就霍議員的提問，經諮詢勞工及福利局（勞福局）及入境處後，我現回覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年六月底，先導計劃／短期訪客計劃已合共惠及36 951名非本地人才，便利他們以訪客身分來港參與共6 200多項短期活動，當中包括新春國際匯演之夜、亞洲金融論壇、香港國際七人欖球賽等盛事，他們在港參與相關短期活動的時間平均約為五天。按界別的統計數字載於附件。入境處沒有備存提問涉及的其他分項統計數字。

（二）勞福局表示，政府在制訂各項人才與資本投資者的入境計劃的收費水平時已平衡各方面的考慮因素，包括「用者自付」原則、海外地區類似申請的收費水平及對相關申請者的影響。其中，考慮到部分申請涉及短期／一次性項目為本的工作，政府在申請費以外實施兩級制簽發費，逗留期限為180日或以下的簽證／入境證簽發費為600元，而181日或以上的則為1,300元，屬合理和可負擔範圍水平。

自有關收費生效後，過去數月有關入境計劃的申請和簽證／入境證簽發數目與去年同期相若。政府會密切留意相關情況，按機制適時檢討收費架構。

（三）至（五）如前述，政府會按機制適時檢討各項人才與資本投資者的入境計劃的簽證／入境證收費架構。

另一方面，為確保短期訪客計劃與時並進，政府不時審視計劃的涵蓋範圍及運作機制，務求使計劃能夠在風險可控的前提下，持續有效地促進相關界別發展，並提升香港的國際形象。自先導計劃推出以來，政府分別兩次在二○二三年二月以及二○二四年六月擴大計劃，在原有10個指定界別外，增加「金融」及「發展與建築」兩個新界別，認可機構亦從計劃剛推出時約350個增加18%至現時的400多個，當中包括政府決策局／部門、公營／法定機構、專業組織和業界協會等。計劃下設有機制，各參與的政策局／部門均會協助把關，確保計劃的執行持續符合政策目標。短期訪客計劃的相關資料，包括目前涵蓋的認可機構和指定短期活動已上載入境處網站: www.immd.gov.hk/hkt/services/visas/stv.html。

目前，不同類別的機構均可與計劃下的認可機構合作舉辦合資格的指定短期活動，以享相關入境便利。我們歡迎業界主動與所屬界別的相關決策局／部門或認可機構聯絡並考慮合辦合資格的活動，以期促進計劃下更多不同形式的交流合作。

在考慮是否進一步放寬計劃時，政府必須考慮兩大原則，包括合資格根據計劃來港進行指定短期活動的人士不會取代本地勞動力，及不會構成濫用風險（包括非法就業）。政府會繼續留意短期訪客計劃的實施情況和相關部門及業界的意見，適時檢討計劃的涵蓋範圍，以期在入境管制與便利之間取得適當平衡。"
LCQ4: Providing facilitation for visitors coming to Hong Kong to participate in short-term activities,2025-10-08 14:42,2025-10-08 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800368.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Fok and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  There are views pointing out that the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (STV Scheme) launched by the Government aims to provide immigration facilitation arrangements to visitors invited or sponsored by authorised host organisations to come to Hong Kong for undertaking short-term activities which are beneficial to the development of Hong Kong and allow them to participate in specified activities in 12 designated sectors during the period of their stay as visitor, which is of positive significance in promoting Hong Kong to develop the ""eight centres"". However, there are views pointing out that the 2025-2026 Budget proposes to introduce application fees for various talent admission schemes and increase visa fees, which will impose cost pressure on the organisations which have not been included in the list of authorised host organisations under the STV Scheme (unauthorised organisations). In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of activities in which visitors coming to Hong Kong under the STV Scheme were allowed to participate in each of the past three years, with a breakdown by type of activities, duration of activities (i.e. 1 to 3 days, 4 to 7 days, 8 to 10 days, and over 10 days) and designated sector;

(2) since the introduction of application fees for talent admission schemes and increase in visa fees, whether the Government has assessed the financial burden imposed on unauthorised organisations by such arrangements, as well as the impact on the number of activities organised by such organisations, including the number of activities cancelled due to financial pressure arising from additional visa fees; if so, of the outcome;

(3) as some members of the industry have relayed that it may necessitate a reduction in international exchange activities due to the rising costs for visa application since organisations are required to apply for employment visas for visitors invited to Hong Kong to participate in short-term activities not covered by activities in the designated sectors under the STV Scheme, of the Government's specific measures in place to support such organisations, such as introducing extremely short-term employment visas at lower costs and streamlining visa application procedures;

(4) to ensure that the STV Scheme remains relevant to industry needs, whether the Government has established mechanisms for regular review, including consulting the representatives from the relevant sectors to update the list of authorised host organisations; whether it will step up efforts in promoting the STV Scheme to the industry, so as to clearly explain the application eligibility and requirements, as well as the specific requirements for activities in each designated sector; and

(5) as there are views that since only four organisations are recognised as authorised host organisations in the ""art and cultural"" sector under the STV Scheme (namely the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, Leisure and Cultural Services Department, Hong Kong Arts Development Council and West Kowloon Cultural District Authority), it is difficult for many arts and cultural groups (arts groups) to benefit from the STV Scheme, which is contrary to the original intent of the Scheme, whether the Government will review the selection mechanism for authorised host organisations, including expanding the coverage of authorised host organisations in the ""art and cultural"" sector to include other recognised arts groups; if so, of the details and timetable?

Reply:

President,

  To encourage more talent to come to Hong Kong for exchanges, the Government launched a two-year Pilot Scheme on Immigration Facilitation for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (Pilot Scheme) in June 2022, which was regularised as the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short term Activities in Designated Sectors (STV Scheme) in June 2024. Under the STV Scheme, organisations authorised by the relevant government bureaux/departments (B/Ds) can issue invitation letters to relevant non-local talent in their sectors. Invited persons may come to Hong Kong to participate in specified short-term activities as visitors without the need to apply for employment visas/entry permits from the Immigration Department (ImmD). They may participate in specified short term activities for up to 14 consecutive calendar days during each trip to Hong Kong, and receive remuneration for the specified activities concerned.

  In consultation with the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) and the ImmD, my reply to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Kenneth Fok is as follows:

(1) As of end-June 2025, the Pilot Scheme/STV Scheme had benefited a total of 36 951 non-local talent, facilitating their entry into Hong Kong as visitors to participate in a total of over 6 200 short-term activities such as the International Chinese New Year Night Parade, the Asian Financial Forum, the Hong Kong Sevens and other major events. They participated in the relevant short-term activities in Hong Kong for about five days on average. The statistics by sector are at Annex. The ImmD does not maintain a breakdown of other statistics mentioned in the question.

(2) LWB indicates that in devising the fee levels for the various admission schemes for talent and capital investors, the Government has balanced various considerations, including the ""user pays"" principle, the fees charged for similar applications in overseas jurisdictions, and the impact on the applicants concerned. In particular, noting that some applications relate to short-term/one-off project-based employment, in addition to application fee, the Government has introduced two tiers of visa/entry permit issuance fee: $600 for visa/entry permit granted with a limit of stay of not more than 180 days, and $1,300 for those with a limit of stay of 181 days or more. The fee levels are modest and affordable.

  Since the introduction of the relevant fees, the number of applications and visas/entry permits issued under the specified admission schemes in the past few months were comparable to those in the same period last year. The Government will closely monitor the relevant situation and review the fee structure as appropriate in accordance with the established mechanism.

(3) to (5) As above-mentioned, the Government will review the visa/entry permit fee structure for the various admission schemes for talent and capital investors as appropriate in accordance with the established mechanism.

  On the other hand, to ensure that the STV Scheme keeps pace with the times, the Government reviews its coverage and operation mechanism from time to time, with a view to ensuring that it can continue to effectively promote the development of relevant sectors and raise Hong Kong's international profile while ensuring that the risks are manageable. Since the launch of the Pilot Scheme, the Government has expanded the scheme twice in February 2023 and June 2024, by adding two new sectors, namely ""Finance"" and ""Development and Construction"", to the original 10 designated sectors. The number of authorised organisations has also increased by 18 per cent from around 350 when the scheme was first launched, to more than 400 at present. These authorised organisations include government B/Ds, public/statutory organisations, professional bodies and industry associations, etc. Through an established mechanism, all participating B/Ds would assist in ensuring that the implementation of the scheme consistently meets policy objectives. Relevant information of the STV Scheme, including the authorised organisations and specified short-term activities that are currently covered by the scheme, is available on the ImmD's website: www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/stv.html.

  At present, different types of organisations can collaborate with authorised organisations under the scheme to organise eligible specified short-term activities, thereby benefiting from the relevant immigration facilitation. We welcome the industry to contact relevant B/Ds or authorised organisations in their respective sectors and consider co-organising eligible events, with a view to promoting more diverse forms of exchange and collaboration under the scheme.

  In considering whether to further relax the scheme, the Government shall take into account two major principles, including that eligible individuals visiting Hong Kong for specified short-term activities under the scheme will not displace the local workforce, and there will not be a risk of abuse (including illegal employment). The Government will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the STV Scheme as well as the views of the relevant departments and the sectors concerned, and timely review the scheme's coverage to strike an appropriate balance between immigration control and facilitation."
立法會十四題：「港資港法」與「港資港仲裁」措施,2025-10-08 14:30,2025-10-08 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800318.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上嚴剛議員的提問和律政司司長林定國資深大律師的書面答覆：

問題：

《〈內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排〉服務貿易協議》的第二份修訂協議（《修訂協議二》）新增「港資港法」和「港資港仲裁」作為便利香港投資者的措施，支持粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）試點城市註冊的港資企業，協議選擇使用香港或澳門法律為合同適用法，以及支持在大灣區珠三角九市註冊的港資企業，選擇香港或澳門為仲裁地。此外，最高人民法院及司法部於本年二月印發的《關於充分發揮仲裁職能作用服務粵港澳大灣區高質量發展的意見》提出擴展該兩項措施的細節。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）就《修訂協議二》新增的「港資港法」和「港資港仲裁」措施，政府會否明確訂明有關的適用範圍，包括涵蓋的行業及案件類別；若會，何時公布有關詳情；

（二）鑑於有意見認為，目前內地與香港在仲裁程序（例如緊急仲裁員制度和臨時措施的申請程序等）上存在差異，在推行「港資港仲裁」措施的過程中，政府如何參與制訂有關的仲裁規則，以及會否推動採用國際通行標準；及

（三）鑑於粵港澳三地將共同商定建立《粵港澳大灣區仲裁員名冊》，政府如何確保本地仲裁員的專業資格與內地標準對接；會否進一步優化各項人才入境計劃，以吸引更多國際仲裁專家來港發展？

答覆：

主席︰

就嚴剛議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）「港資港法」措施自二○二○年在深圳前海試行，而「港資港仲裁」措施則在二○一七年起於內地自由貿易試驗區試行，兩項措施均受持份者歡迎。

二○二四年十月兩地簽訂《〈內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排〉服務貿易協議》的第二份修訂協議，其中將「港資港法」和「港資港仲裁」措施首次納入《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》，並明確支持在粵港澳大灣區內擴大該兩項措施適用範圍，體現中央政府對於香港法律制度的重視與支持。

「港資港法」和「港資港仲裁」的擴展已經自二○二五年二月十四日起實施，相關適用範圍及細節載於：（一）最高人民法院發出的《關於在粵港澳大灣區內地登記設立的香港、澳門投資企業協議選擇港澳法律為合同適用法律或者協議約定港澳為仲裁地效力問題的批覆》（法釋〔2025〕3 號）；以及（二）最高人民法院與司法部共同發出的《關於充分發揮仲裁職能作用服務粵港澳大灣區高質量發展的意見》。

根據上述最高人民法院與司法部發出的兩份文件的規定，兩項措施的擴展詳情如下：


「港資港法」措施由前海擴展至深圳及珠海。擴展後，當事人一方或雙方為在深圳或珠海登記設立的香港投資企業，可協議選擇香港或澳門特區法律為合同適用法律；
「港資港仲裁」措施從內地自由貿易試驗區，進一步涵蓋粵港澳大灣區內地九市。擴展後，當事人一方或雙方為在內地自由貿易試驗區及大灣區內地九市登記設立的香港投資企業，可在無「涉港澳因素」的情況下，選擇香港、澳門作為仲裁地；及
明確「香港投資企業」寬鬆定義：全部或部分由香港特區的自然人、企業或者其他組織投資，依法在內地登記設立的企業，均可受惠於兩項措施。


相關企業是否能享受「港資港法」或「港資港仲裁」措施，視乎該企業的登記地點，以及是否符合港資身分，並無行業及案件類別的限制。換句話來說，只要是在措施適用的地點登記設立的港資企業，即可受惠於相關措施。

（二）香港作為中國境內唯一實行普通法的司法管轄區，仲裁制度成熟、現代化，並與國際最佳做法高度接軌。就法律框架而言，香港《仲裁條例》（第609章）採納了聯合國國際貿易法委員會的《國際商事仲裁示範法》作為仲裁立法的藍本，為仲裁提供了基本的法律框架，包括司法保障和協助。

在當事人自主的原則下，當事人可自由選擇仲裁機構、仲裁規則等以管理具體的仲裁程序。而各仲裁機構獨立運作，不受政府干預。

根據倫敦大學瑪麗皇后學院最新進行的國際仲裁調查，香港獲評為與新加坡並列的全球第二最受歡迎仲裁地，反映香港的仲裁法律框架成熟完善，並獲國際商業社會認可。此外，在同一調查中，香港國際仲裁中心規則獲選為全球第二受歡迎的仲裁規則，可見不同司法管轄區的當事人，均信賴並樂意選擇在香港進行仲裁程序。

（三）仲裁員的專業資格方面

為建立《粵港澳大灣區仲裁員名冊》，律政司與廣東和澳門的法律部門於二○二五年七月三十日共同正式發布及實施《粵港澳大灣區仲裁員名冊工作指引》，當中列出三地共同認可的仲裁員推薦條件，以確保大灣區仲裁員的專業素質。

大灣區仲裁員推薦條件包括（一）擁護《中華人民共和國憲法》，擁護《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區基本法》、《中華人民共和國澳門特別行政區基本法》；（二）職業道德良好，未有因不良名譽或者違反職業道德受懲處的紀錄；（三）獲內地、香港或澳門其中兩地的仲裁機構納入其仲裁員名冊；（四）具有累計五年以上擔任仲裁員實務經驗；（五）累計擔任至少五宗仲裁案件的仲裁員並撰寫仲裁裁決，其中至少三宗仲裁案件為跨法域仲裁案件；（六）熟練掌握普通話（或粵語）和至少一門中文以外的語言。

粵港澳大灣區法律部門聯席會議（聯席會議）可按被推薦人的實際情況豁免上述第（三）至（六）項中一項或多項條件要求。三地法律部門也可結合本地實際情況，在上述統一推薦條件的基礎上增加推薦條件，並向聯席會議報備。

律政司正積極與廣東及澳門相關部委保持聯繫，爭取在今年底前訂立《粵港澳大灣區仲裁員名冊》，鼓勵仲裁在大灣區內的應用，並為用家提供更多便利。

人才入境計劃方面

政府致力鞏固香港作為國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位，並推出了一系列政策吸引及便利國際仲裁專家來港進行仲裁相關的業務。

政府於二○一八年制訂首份香港人才清單，旨在更有效及聚焦地吸引高質素人才，以配合香港經濟高增值及多元化的發展。人才清單持續更新和優化，在現行人才清單的爭議解決專才領域下，已涵蓋專門解決國際商業、金融，以及國家與投資者之間糾紛的仲裁員。

政府亦於二○二五年三月一日起恆常推行「為來港參與仲裁程序的人士提供入境便利計劃」。在計劃下，有關人士如持有由指定仲裁及爭議解決機構或場地提供者發出的證明書，證明其為參與在香港進行的仲裁程序的合資格人士，便可獲准以訪客身分來港參與仲裁程序，無須取得工作簽證。

經優化的計劃涵蓋五類人士：（一）仲裁員；（二）專家證人和事實證人；（三）代表仲裁程序任何一方的律師；（四）仲裁程序各方；以及（五）與仲裁直接有關或參與仲裁的其他人士例如仲裁庭秘書、仲裁庭指定專家。

政府會持續密切監察有關政策措施的運作情況，並適時檢討與優化。"
"LCQ14: The measures of ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law"" and ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to choose for arbitration to be seated in Hong Kong""",2025-10-08 14:30,2025-10-08 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800321.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Erik Yim and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

The Second Agreement Concerning Amendment to the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement Agreement on Trade in Services (Amendment Agreement II) brings the addition of ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law"" and ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to choose for arbitration to be seated in Hong Kong"" as facilitation measures for Hong Kong investors, supports Hong Kong-invested enterprises registered in the pilot municipalities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to adopt Hong Kong law or Macao law as the applicable law in their contracts, and supports Hong Kong-invested enterprises registered in the nine Pearl River Delta municipalities in the GBA to choose Hong Kong or Macao as the seat of arbitration. In addition, the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice jointly issued the Opinion on Fully Leveraging the Functions of Arbitration to Serve the High-Quality Development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in February this year to propose the extension details of the two measures. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) regarding the addition of the measures of ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law"" and ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to choose for arbitration to be seated in Hong Kong"" under Amendment Agreement II, whether the Government will clearly specify their scopes of application, including the industries and types of cases covered; if so, when the relevant details will be announced;

(2) given the views that at present there are differences in the arbitral proceedings between the Mainland and Hong Kong (such as the emergency arbitrator system and application procedures for interim measures), how the Government will take part in formulating the relevant arbitration rules in implementing the measure of ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to choose for arbitration to be seated in Hong Kong"", and whether it will promote the adoption of internationally accepted standards; and

(3) given that Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have agreed to jointly establish the Panel of GBA Arbitrators, how the Government will ensure that the professional qualifications of local arbitrators align with the standards adopted in the Mainland; whether it will further enhance the various talent admission schemes to attract more international arbitration experts to come to Hong Kong for development?

Reply:

President,

In response to the enquiry raised by the Hon Erik Yim, the reply is as follows:

(1) The measure of ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law"" has been piloted in Qianhai, Shenzhen, since 2020 whereas the measure of ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to choose Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration"" has been in trial implementation since 2017 in Chinese Mainland's Pilot Free Trade Zones. Both measures have been well received by stakeholders.

In October 2024, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and the Chinese Mainland signed the Second Agreement Concerning Amendment to the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement Agreement on Trade in Services, which, for the first time, incorporated the above two measures into the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement. The amendments support the expansion of the applicable scope of these two measures in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, reflecting the Central Government's emphasis and support for Hong Kong's legal system.

The extension of both measures has been in force since February 14, 2025. Details such as the applicable scope are set out in: (1) the Supreme People's Court's ""Official Reply on the Issues concerning the Validity of the Adoption of Hong Kong or Macao Law as the Applicable Law of Contracts or the Designation of Hong Kong or Macao as the Seat of Arbitration by Hong Kong or Macao-Invested Enterprises Registered in the Mainland Part of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area"" (Fa Shi No. 3 [2025]); and (2) ""Opinion on Fully Leveraging the Functions of Arbitration to Serve the High-Quality Development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area"" jointly issued by the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice.

According to the two documents issued by the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice, the details of the expansion are as follows:

• The ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law"" measure is extended from Qianhai, Shenzhen to the whole of Shenzhen and Zhuhai municipalities. After the expansion, where either party or both parties are Hong Kong-invested enterprises registered in Shenzhen or Zhuhai, the parties may agree to choose Hong Kong or Macao law as the law applicable to the contract;

• The ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to choose Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration"" measure, previously applicable to Pilot Free Trade Zones in the Chinese Mainland, is further extended to nine Mainland municipalities in the GBA. After the expansion, where either party or both parties are Hong Kong-invested enterprises established and registered in any of the said municipalities, the parties may agree to choose Hong Kong or Macao as the seat of arbitration even in the absence of ""Hong Kong/Macao-related elements""; and

• The definition of ""Hong Kong-invested enterprise"" is broadened: enterprises which are wholly or partially invested by natural persons, enterprises or other organisations from the Hong Kong SAR and are established and registered in the Chinese Mainland in accordance with its laws, may benefit from these measures.

Whether an enterprise can benefit from the above two measures depends on its place of registration and whether it is Hong Kong-invested as defined above. There are no restrictions on industry or case type. In other words, any Hong Kong-invested enterprise registered in a qualifying location can benefit from the respective measures.

(2) As the only common law jurisdiction in China, Hong Kong has a mature and modern arbitration system that is highly aligned with international best practice. In terms of legal framework, Hong Kong's Arbitration Ordinance (Cap. 609) is based on the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, providing a basic legal framework for arbitration including judicial safeguards and support.

Under the principle of party autonomy, parties are free to choose the arbitral institutions, arbitration rules, etc to govern their specific arbitral proceedings. Arbitral institutions operate independently and are not subject to government interference.

According to the latest International Arbitration Survey conducted by Queen Mary University of London, Hong Kong is ranked the second most preferred seat of arbitration globally, along with Singapore. This reflects the maturity and comprehensiveness of Hong Kong's arbitration legal framework, which is recognised by the international business community. Furthermore, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre Rules is ranked the second most preferred set of arbitration rules globally in the same survey, demonstrating the trust and willingness of parties from various jurisdictions to conduct arbitral proceedings in Hong Kong.

(3) Regarding the professional qualifications of arbitrators

To establish the Panel of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Arbitrators (Panel of GBA Arbitrators), the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the legal departments of Guangdong and Macao, have jointly promulgated the Working Guidelines on the Panel of GBA Arbitrators (Working Guidelines) on July 30, 2025. The Working Guidelines set out the criteria recognised by the three places for nominating arbitrators to ensure the professionalism of GBA arbitrators.

The criteria for nomination of GBA arbitrators include: (1) upholding the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China; (2) possessing good professional ethics with no record of disciplinary action for negative reputation or professional misconduct; (3) being included in the list of arbitrators by arbitral institutions in two out of the three places, namely Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao; (4) possessing more than five years of experience as an arbitrator; (5) having served as an arbitrator and drafted awards for at least five arbitration cases, of which at least three were cross-jurisdictional arbitration cases; (6) proficient in Putonghua (or Cantonese) and at least one language other than Chinese.

The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Legal Departments Joint Conference (Joint Conference) may, depending on the actual circumstances of the nominated arbitrator, exercise its discretion to exempt one or more of the requirement(s) among items (3) to (6) above. The legal departments of the three places may, having regard to their local actual circumstances, impose additional local criteria for nomination in addition to the above-mentioned unified criteria for nomination, and report to the Joint Conference for record.

The DoJ is actively liaising with the relevant authorities in Guangdong and Macao, aiming to establish the Panel of GBA Arbitrators before the end of this year, and to encourage the use of arbitration in the GBA and provide greater convenience for users.

Regarding talent admission mechanisms

The Government is committed to strengthening Hong Kong's position as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre and has introduced a series of policies to attract and facilitate international arbitration experts to conduct arbitration-related work in Hong Kong.

The Government promulgated the first Talent List of Hong Kong in 2018, aiming to attract high quality talents more effectively and in a focused manner to support Hong Kong's high value-added and diversified economy. The Talent List has been continuously updated and refined. Under the current Talent List, arbitrators specialising in resolving international commercial, financial and investor-state disputes are already included in the category of Dispute Resolution Professionals.

The Government has also regularised the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Persons Participating in Arbitral Proceedings in Hong Kong (Scheme) with effect from March 1, 2025. Under the Scheme, relevant individuals are allowed to participate in arbitral proceedings in Hong Kong as visitors without the need to obtain an employment visa if they are in possession of a letter of proof issued by a designated arbitral and dispute resolution institution or venue provider proving that they are eligible persons participating in arbitral proceedings in Hong Kong.

This refined Scheme covers five categories of persons: (1) arbitrators; (2) expert and factual witnesses; (3) counsel in the arbitration; (4) parties to the arbitration; and (5) other persons directly related to or involved in the arbitration such as tribunal secretaries, tribunal-appointed experts.

The Government will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the relevant policy initiatives, and review and refine them in a timely manner."

現時不少大型活動均會提供餐飲服務。在審批相關牌照申請時，食環署和相關部門會與活動主辦者緊密溝通，因應場地和活動的實際情況，制定適合的牌照條件，一方面便利活動進行，另一方面確保食物安全、環境衞生和消防安全等。

（四）政府在《施政報告》公布將會讓食肆經營者提出申請，容許狗隻進入食肆，為業界帶來全新商機。政府會諮詢相關業界，並參考內地及海外地區的做法和經驗，制訂容許狗隻進入食肆的執行細節，當中包括獲批食肆必須明確標識，讓市民有所選擇，並須遵守指定規定和安排，務求在保障食物安全和環境衞生的同時，顧及業界和顧客的需要。

食環署預計在二○二六年年中批出首輪申請，讓一定數量的食肆容許狗隻進入。政府會留意實施情況、業界和社會的反應等，並按需要優化執行細節。"
LCQ16: Outside seating accommodation of restaurants,2025-10-08 14:25,2025-10-08 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800350.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Rock Chen and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" announced that the Government will streamline the procedures to expedite the approval process of applications for outside seating accommodation (OSA) of restaurants and introduce a licensing arrangement allowing operators to let dogs enter their food premises. There are views that the measures relating to OSA and allowing dogs to enter food premises are conducive to the expansion of business opportunities for food premises, thereby effectively unleashing the economic vitality of the community. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of applications for OSA licences of restaurants received and approved by the Government over the past three years, as well as the average number of days for vetting and approving those applications and the success rate; the anticipated average number of working days to be shortened to in vetting and approving those applications following the introduction of measures to expedite the approval process of OSA applications; whether there are plans to introduce artificial intelligence technologies to streamline the approval process; if so, of the specific timetable for implementing such technologies;

(2) of the following information regarding restaurants approved by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department to set up OSA in the past three years: (i) the number of prosecutions in respect of contraventions relating to OSA in each year; (ii) the average amount of fine and highest penalty imposed in such prosecution cases; (iii) ‍the number of restaurants which had their restaurant licenses revoked due to contraventions relating to OSA; and (iv) the average amount of Government rent paid by restaurants for setting up OSA;

(3) while introducing measures to expedite the approval process for OSA applications of restaurants, whether it will review the clauses for setting up OSA, e.g. requiring restaurants located in areas with high daytime but low nigh-time pedestrian flows to set up OSA during night time only; whether flexible approval procedures and management standards can be put in place for OSA applications of restaurants near venues of special events, such as those organising ""a mega event in every district"", so as to stimulate the economic vitality of the community and meet the operational needs during the mega events; and

(4) of the details of the research conducted by the Government on allowing dogs to enter food premises, including whether it has examined the specific practices of allowing dogs to enter food premises in the Mainland and overseas countries and regions (e.g. the type of applicable premises, conditions for dog access, operational management regulations, health safeguards and dispute resolution mechanism); whether relevant management measures and code of practice for the licensing arrangement allowing operators to let dogs enter their food premises would be developed based on the research findings, with a view to achieving a pet-friendly community while safeguarding restaurants and public health security?

Reply:

President,

 The Government announced in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" that to further expedite the approval process of applications for outside seating accommodation (OSA) of restaurants, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will adopt a new way by proactively co-ordinating various relevant departments to undergo ""joint-vetting"" to resolve the matter together, and when necessary, escalate the process regarding complicated applications to the relevant Permanent Secretary or even the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration for steer, at the same time, the procedures will be streamlined. In consultation with the Lands Department, the reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Rock Chen is as follows:

(1) In the past three years, the number of applications for OSA of restaurants received by the FEHD, the processing time, cases approved and success rate are as follows:







2022
2023
2024


Number of applications
73
98
93


Approvals granted (Note 1)
37
32
63


Median processing time (months)
19
23
16


Success rate (Note 2)
41%
40%
30%



Notes:
(1) Included cases where applications were made that year or earlier but approved that year.
(2) Calculated based on the year when application was received, by dividing the number of cases received that year and approved as of August 2025 by all applications received that year (including applications later withdrawn, given up by the applicants or rejected).

The processing time of applications varies depending on the time needed for the applicant to comply with licensing requirements, handle objections from the public or relevant departments, and resolve land and other issues. It is expected that with the streamlined procedures and the ""joint-vetting"" mechanism, applications which are simple and straightforward could be approved within about a month. Relevant departments are working on the arrangements for streamlining the workflow so as to set concrete target timelines.

 The FEHD has also been actively applying AI technology in various areas of its work to enhance effectiveness, such as tackling fly-tipping and monitoring rodent infestation. It will continue to explore applying such technology in different areas of work to further enhance efficiency.

(2) In the past three years, prosecutions and fines imposed against restaurants with approved OSA due to OSA-related breaches are as follows:




Year
Number of prosecutions
Average fine ($)
Maximum fine ($)


2022
62
1,222
5,000


2023
72
1,614
6,500


2024
57
1,818
6,500




  During the same period, no restaurant licences were revoked as a result of these violations.

 Regarding land rent, for applications to set up OSA on Government land, the Lands Department or departments managing the relevant land lot will, after consulting relevant departments, generally issues land licences or short-term tenancies, based on the specific circumstances of the land use. As of end-August 2025, the relevant annual fees for approved land licences or short-term tenancies are:




Approval Type
Average Fee


Land licence
About $3.4 per square metre


Short-term tenancy
About $630 per square metre



Note: The actual fees payable for each case vary depending on the location of the land.

(3) The FEHD will coordinate relevant departments to undergo ""joint-vetting"" to resolve matter together and at the same time, streamline procedures, including adopting standardised Government rent for OSA, and allowing some applications to proceed without the requirement for increasing kitchen area and bathroom facilities. As for applications involving walkways with a remaining width of three metres or more after the provision of OSA, they will generally be considered as meeting the basic traffic requirements and do not have to be reviewed case-by-case. The Government will launch internal guidelines on the new ""joint-vetting"" mechanism to expedite applications for OSA of restaurants in Q4 2025 for implementation by departments.

 At present, many large-scale events provide catering services. When vetting relevant licence applications, the FEHD and other relevant departments will liaise closely with event organisers to develop suitable licensing conditions that take into account the venue and operational needs, so as to facilitate the events and ensure food safety, environmental hygiene and fire safety etc.

(4) The Government announced in the Policy Address that restaurant operators will be allowed to apply for permission to let dogs enter their food premises, creating new business opportunities for the industry. The Government will consult relevant trades and draw reference from practices and experiences on the Mainland and overseas, in order to formulate the implementation details of letting dogs enter food premises. Approved restaurants must display clear signage so that the public can make an informed choice, and have to comply with specified requirements and arrangements so as to balance the safeguarding of food safety and environmental hygiene, as well as the interests of the trade and consumers.

 The FEHD expects to grant permission to the first batch of applications by mid-2026, permitting a certain number of restaurants to allow dogs to enter. The Government will monitor the implementation, industry uptake and community response, and refine the details of operation as necessary."
醫務衞生局局長出席立法會接種季節性流感疫苗和新冠疫苗活動發言（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-08 13:32,2025-10-08 14:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800369.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（十月八日）出席立法會接種季節性流感疫苗和新冠疫苗活動發言：

梁君彥大主席（立法會主席）、各位議員、各位傳媒朋友：

很高興今日到立法會參與一年一度的約會，就是為立法會議員接種流感疫苗，同時安排接種新冠疫苗加強劑。

流行性感冒，簡稱流感，因有「感冒」二字，令很多人產生誤會，以為流行性感冒即是感冒，以為只是發燒、輕微咳嗽等小事，很快會痊癒，但大家不要誤會，流感可以引起嚴重併發症，甚至需要住院，亦有死亡個案。

接種疫苗是最有效預防流行性感冒的方法，應對普通感冒，我們不會接種疫苗；但流感可以預防，許多數據證明流感疫苗可以預防併發症、減低入院和死亡風險。

我們去年（二○二四／二五年度流感疫苗接種）做得很好，共接種超過209萬劑疫苗，較上一年度增加11.7%。這是很重要的原因，令去年的成人和兒童嚴重流感個案較新冠疫情前的流感季節分別減少兩成和六成，學校大規模爆發減少近九成。這都是因為我們有疫苗接種這個重要元素。

今年情況如何﹖我們永遠希望在健康上追求進步，不會滿足，特別是看到小朋友的嚴重併發個案可能會引致死亡，真是一宗都嫌多。今年九月才開始夏季流感季節，今年正如剛才主席所講，我們預計夏季流感與冬季流感可能會重疊，而今年自開學夏季流感季節開始，已經有超過250間學校出現群組爆發個案，有九位小朋友因出現嚴重流感併發症而入院，所以今年我們更加應該要做得更好。

政府在今年的流感疫苗接種計劃有五項優化措施，包括擴大資助範圍；優化學校外展計劃，讓家長有更多選擇；院舍方面，我們提供重組流感疫苗；我們亦首次為家庭醫生推出疫苗採購；最後亦優化資訊發放，希望可以提升疫苗接種率。

我亦很開心在此向大家報告，由九月二十二日展開疫苗接種計劃起，截至現時的最新數字，我們已經在首兩星期內共接種約33萬劑流感疫苗。大家記得去年的數字創新高，較之前增加11.7%。而今年度直至現在為止，首兩星期共接種約33萬劑流感疫苗，較去年同期再上升9.4%。我希望這個勢頭可以繼續，而我亦希望今日這個活動可以讓立法會議員幫助我們一同向大家展示接種流感疫苗其實很安全，沒有甚麼副作用，亦可以真正保護大家的健康。行政長官和一眾政府官員其實前一、兩星期已經接種了疫苗，希望議員今日接種後，市民都會積極參與。要記得︰「一年打一次，宜早不宜遲，十月最合時」。謝謝大家！"
LCQ19: Spalling of mosaic tiles in public housing estates,2025-10-08 13:20,2025-10-08 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800331.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kingsley Wong and a written reply by the Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  I often receive complaints and requests for assistance from residents of public housing estates (PHEs) about the spalling of mosaic tiles on the external walls of buildings, and it was reported that there were occasional accidents of members of the public being injured by spalled mosaic tiles detaching from the external walls of buildings. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the list of PHEs where mosaic tiles have been used as a major building material for external walls;

(2) of the number of cases of mosaic tiles spalling (on external walls, walls of lift lobbies and corridors, etc) in PHEs over the past three years and, among such cases, the number of those resulting in injuries to passers-by, as well as the estates involved in such cases (including the names of blocks) and their block types (e.g. Trident, Harmony, and Concord), their years of completion, and the causes of the spalling of mosaic tiles on the external walls;

(3) given that the spalling of mosaic tiles will also occur at locations such as walls of lift lobbies and corridors in PHEs, whether the Government has measures in place to ensure the safe entry and exit of residents, such as arranging professionals to carry out regular checks and timely repairs;

(4) whether it will conduct a general survey on the conditions of mosaic tiles in older PHEs (e.g. those aged 30 years or above) to facilitate early repair works, thereby safeguarding public safety; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) of the main reasons for using mosaic tiles as a material for the walls of buildings (including external walls, walls of lift lobbies and corridors) in PHEs; whether it will consider reducing the use of mosaic tiles and choosing other building materials that are equally aesthetic and practical but safer?

Reply:

President,

  The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has always placed great emphasis on building safety. Through daily inspections and various inspection and maintenance programmes, public housing estates receive timely and proper maintenance and repairs to ensure they remain in good condition.

  In response to the question raised by the Hon Kingsley Wong, our reply is as follows:

(1) Currently, there are 128 public housing estates under the HA using mosaic tiles as the exterior wall finishing materials. Please refer to Annex I.

(2) The Housing Department (HD) conducts daily inspections of the common areas and facilities within public housing estates, including lift lobbies and corridors, to maintain facility safety and environmental hygiene. Upon identifying facilities requiring maintenance during inspections (such as spalling of mosaic tiles) or receiving reports from tenants, the HD would promptly arrange repairs. According to our records, there were a total of 23 cases of spalling of mosaic tiles on the external walls, with three cases involving minor injuries to pedestrians from January 1, 2022 to August 31, 2025. The estate offices took immediate follow-up actions, including cordoning off the affected passageways, inspecting other sections of the external walls, and arranging repairs. All cases were fully resolved. In general, mosaic tiles on external wall may spall due to ageing or environmental factors, such as change in temperature and humidity, but this does not affect the overall structural integrity of the building. For details of the aforementioned cases involving spalling of mosaic tiles from external wall, please refer to Annex II.

(3) and (4) The HD has been conducting daily inspections and implementing professional maintenance and repair programmes across all public housing estates in Hong Kong. Based on factors such as the age and structural condition of buildings, timely inspections and repairs are arranged to ensure structural integrity and safety, thereby providing residents with a secure and comfortable living environment. The relevant work mainly includes the following:

(i) Daily Inspections: Covering all public housing estates regardless of building age, frontline staff conduct daily inspections of buildings and communal facilities, following up on items requiring repair in a timely manner;

(ii) Annual Technical Inspection: Each estate undergoes an annual review to establish a yearly maintenance plan, which includes inspection and upkeep of public facilities (e.g. fire doors, floor tiles, external walls, etc) and equipment (e.g. lifts, fire safety installations, pipelines, etc) to enhance efficiency and safety standards;

(iii) Total Maintenance Scheme: Proactive inspections are conducted for public rental housing aged 10 years or above. During these inspections, attention is also given to the condition of external walls near the flats. If external wall repairs are identified, appropriate follow-up actions will be taken. This approach not only improves tenants' living environment, but also extends the service life of the flats;

(iv) External Wall Finishes Repair Programme: For older public housing estates (e.g. those aged 30 years or above), the HD arranges external wall inspections and repairs as needed to enhance the safety and durability of external walls; and

(v) Comprehensive Structural Investigation Programme: Detailed structural safety assessments are conducted for public housing estates approaching or exceeding 40 years of age. These assessments verify the structural safety and evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of preserving these buildings for at least 15 years or more through repairs and structural strengthening works.

  In addition to the above inspection and survey works, the HD actively explores the application of innovative technologies to shorten inspection time and enhance effectiveness. The HD currently uses handheld infrared thermographic cameras during inspections and, when necessary, deploys small drones equipped with imaging and infrared thermographic capabilities to examine building exteriors. These drones integrate with an artificial intelligence analysis platform to automatically identify external wall defects, such as spalling of mosaic tiles, and generate risk assessment reports to prioritise items requiring attention. This approach significantly enhances the efficiency of preventive maintenance with notable overall results. Furthermore, the HD carries out comprehensive external wall inspections and repairs approximately every ten years prior to its building redecorating works.

(5) The HA has consistently established a set of appropriate construction standards and specifications for new public housing developments. These standards and specifications are regularly updated in response to advancement of new construction technologies, building materials, and latest codes of practice. Buildings constructed in Hong Kong during the 1970s and 1980s, including public housing estates developed by the HA at that time, were commonly constructed with mosaic tiles as finishing material. Since around 2010, the HA has adopted a cleaner design for public housing. Consequently, the external walls, corridors and lift lobby walls of residential blocks in public housing estates are mainly finished with paint, while ceramic tiles are incorporated into the lobby design. Given the diverse colours of mosaic tiles and their applicability to different patterns, mosaic tiles continue to be used occasionally for feature walls in public spaces of housing projects as a highlight."
立法會十九題：公共屋邨的紙皮石剝落問題,2025-10-08 13:20,2025-10-08 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800330.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上黃國議員的提問和房屋局局長何永賢的書面答覆：

就黃國議員的提問，我們現回覆如下：

（一）現時房委會轄下有128個公共屋邨有採用紙皮石作為外牆建築飾面物料，有關公共租住屋邨（屋邨）的資料請參閱附件一。

（二）房屋署會每日巡視屋邨的公用地方及設施的狀況，包括升降機大堂及走廊等，保持設施安全及環境衞生。當巡視時發現有設施需要維修（例如紙皮石剝落）或收到居民反映後，房屋署均會即時安排維修。根據紀錄，由二○二二年一月一日至二○二五年八月三十一日，合共有23宗外牆紙皮石剝落個案，其中三宗個案涉及途人受輕傷。屋邨辦事處已即時作出跟進，包括圍封有關通道、檢視外牆其他部分及安排維修，所有個案已完成修繕。一般而言，外牆紙皮石會因老化或環境因素（例如溫度及濕度變化）影響而出現剝落，惟不會影響大廈的整體樓宇結構。就上述涉及外牆紙皮石剝落的個案資料，請參閱附件二。

（三）及（四）房屋署一直透過日常巡視和專業的保養維修計劃，勘察全港屋邨的樓宇，並會因應樓宇年期和結構狀況等，適時安排勘察或維修，以保持樓宇結構穩固安全，為住戶提供安全舒適的居住環境。相關工作主要如下：

（i）日常巡查：涵蓋所有樓齡的屋邨樓宇，前線同事每日巡視屋邨內的樓宇和公共設施，適時跟進需要進行維修的項目；

（ii）年度保養巡查：屋邨每年均會進行年度檢視，制定年度保養項目，包括檢查和維護公共設施（防火門、地台瓦、外牆等）、裝備（升降機、消防設備、管道等），以提升效能和安全水平；

（iii）全方位維修計劃：主動勘察樓齡達10年或以上的公屋單位的室內狀況，在勘察室內狀況時，亦會同時留意公屋單位附近外牆的狀況，如發現外牆有需要維修，會作出適當跟進。此舉不但提升租戶的居住環境質素，同時延長公屋單位使用年期；

（iv）外牆勘察維修：針對樓齡較高的屋邨樓宇（例如約30年以上），房屋署會按需要安排外牆檢查及修葺，提升外牆的安全和耐用度；及

（v）全面結構勘察計劃：針對樓齡接近或超過40年的公屋進行詳細的結構安全評估，以確定這些高樓齡公屋的結構安全，並評估透過修葺和結構鞏固等工程，持續保存該等樓宇15年或以上的可行性及經濟效益。

除了以上巡查及勘察工作外，房屋署積極尋求應用創新科技以縮短勘察時間及提高成效。房屋署現時不但會在勘察時使用手提紅外線熱成像攝影機，有需要時更會運用配備影像拍攝及紅外線熱成像功能的小型無人機進行樓宇外牆勘察，結合人工智能分析平台自動識別外牆缺陷，例如紙皮石脫落等，生成風險評估報告以標記需優先處理項目，有效提升預防性維護的效率，整體成效顯著。另外，房屋署大約每10年為屋邨進行大廈粉飾工程，在粉飾工程進行前，亦會為大廈外牆進行全面檢查及維修。

（五）房委會一直為新建的公營房屋訂立一套合適的建屋規格及標準。這些規格及標準會因應新的建造技術、建築物料、作業守則等而更新。在70及80年代興建的香港建築物，包括當時房委會的公共屋邨，都會選用紙皮石作為飾面。大約自二○一○年起，房委會的公營房屋採用了更簡約設計。因此，公共屋邨住宅大樓外牆、樓層走廊及升降機大堂牆身飾面主要採用漆料，而大堂設計上部份飾面會加入瓷磚。由於紙皮石富有多樣的色彩，能拼砌不同的圖案，故仍會小量應用於項目的公共空間特色牆作為點綴。"
立法會十三題：公營房屋的無障礙設施,2025-10-08 13:15,2025-10-08 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800363.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上楊永杰議員的提問和房屋局局長何永賢的書面答覆：

問題：

部分高樓齡公營房屋（包括香港房屋委員會（房委會）的公共租住屋邨（公共屋邨）及香港房屋協會（房協）的出租屋邨）的居民反映，邨內缺乏足夠的無障礙通道及設施，不利長者及行動不便人士出行。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（二）據悉由靠背壟道接駁房協轄下樂民新村A座至E座的樓梯通道是往返該屋邨的必經之路，但有意見指出該通道缺乏無障礙設施，對長者及行動不便人士的日常出入造成不便，政府會否促請房協在樂民新村的有關位置興建斜道或升降機，以解決有關問題；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆:

主席：

就楊永杰議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）香港房屋委員會（房委會）一直致力提升公共屋邨的無障礙通道及設施，以滿足公屋居民及使用者，特別是長者和殘疾人士對無障礙通道的需要。

房委會的既定政策是在切實可行的情況下，遵從《設計手冊：暢通無阻的通道》（《設計手冊》）的現行規定，提供無障礙通道和設施。因應《設計手冊1997》和《設計手冊2008》的推出，房委會已分別在二○○一年和二○一○年為房委會轄下於《設計手冊》推出前落成的物業進行必要的無障礙設施改善工程。這些改善工程包括鋪設斜道、在通道安裝合適的扶手、鋪設及擴建觸覺引路徑接連屋邨主要入口至屋邨範圍內的主要設施和住宅大廈的出入口等。但個別樓宇或會因不同限制，例如樓宇設計，而未能完全加裝相關設施或進行改建。至於所有在二○○八年十二月一日後動工興建的新房委會建築物，及當一些現有房委會建築物需進行改建或加建工程時，在切實可行的情況下，均會按照《設計手冊2008》所載的強制規定來規劃及開展工程。因應居民的不同需求，房委會亦會作出靈活安排，例如我們現時正為坪石邨、禾輋邨及沙角邨等高樓齡公共屋邨額外加建斜道，以連接邨內主要屋邨設施，便利居民進出。房委會在新建的公共屋邨已採用「通用設計」的概念，以締造傷健一家、和諧共融的生活環境。

另外，為加強屋邨無障礙事宜的統籌工作，房委會自二○一一年起推出無障礙統籌經理和無障礙主任計劃，於各公共屋邨的無障礙主任會負責協助有需要的人士使用邨內的無障礙通道及設施。

除了在公用地方提供無障礙設施外，長者或殘疾人士如有實際需要，亦可向房委會申請改裝單位內的設施。房委會會參考醫生、物理治療師、職業治療師或醫務社工等人士的建議，免費為相關租戶進行調適工程。這些工程包括在可行情況下在單位入口設置斜道、擴闊浴室門口、在適當地面鋪設防滑地磚等。如租戶只要求在浴室加裝扶手或將浴缸改裝成淋浴間，房委會一般可以直接為租戶免費安排有關工程，無需取得醫生或物理治療師的建議。

香港房屋協會（房協）方面，為應對轄下出租屋邨及其居民「雙老化」的挑戰，房協持續投放資源進行大型改善工程，以提升大廈及屋邨公共地方的暢達度及增加無障礙設施，例如加裝升降機及轉乘電梯、設置電動爬梯機，以及興建升降機大樓及接駁天橋等。此外，房協過去十年已先後為轄下高樓齡的出租屋邨完成更換超過七十部升降機，並計劃陸續為其他合適的高樓齡公共屋邨進行更換升降機工程。未來，房協會繼續檢視轄下公共屋邨的狀況，研究在可行及合適的情況下加入和優化無障礙通道或設施。

（二）房協轄下的樂民新村共有11幢大廈，於一九七○至一九七三年分期落成，其中六幢大廈（即A座至F座）由低至高依山而建，而F座位處的地勢較高。為方便居民出入，房協已於二○一四年完成興建轉乘升降機大樓及連接F座的行人天橋，並加建有蓋行人通道，居民可於F座樓下的靠背壟道平路出入口乘搭升降機上F座，然後向下行前往A座至E座，而毋須經靠背壟道的屋邨正門上坡而行。

現時A座至E座的居民仍需經過一些樓梯方可到達各座門口。就此，房協已委聘工程顧問公司，現正就於A座至E座合適位置增設無障礙通道（如斜道或升降機）進行可行性研究，包括考慮現場的岩土地質及有關工程對現有居民生活作息的影響等因素。

此外，房協亦已委託初創企業研發相關的房地產科技方案，以協助居民在樓梯搬運一些例如糧油白米等與日常生活有關的重物，進一步加強支援居民。

就公共屋邨內的各項設施，房委會和房協會繼續與地方社區團體／人士、以及公共屋邨內的居民積極溝通和進行研究，探討優化方向，以照顧公共屋邨內不同人士，包括長者和殘疾人士等的需要。"

問題：

據報根據警方最新數字，去年涉及內地學生的電話詐騙案共有327宗，損失總金額超過2億3,000萬元，平均每名學生被騙超過70萬元，此外近日有來自內地的本港大學生懷疑因誤墮假冒官員的電話騙局而蒙受損失，繼而跳樓輕生。就此，政府可否告知本會：

答覆：

主席︰

詐騙乃嚴重罪行。任何人干犯《盜竊罪條例》（第210章）第16A條「欺詐罪」，最高可判處監禁14年；若被控同一條例第17條「以欺騙手段取得財產」，最高可判處監禁10年。另外，任何人因詐騙得益而被控《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章）第25條「處理已知道或相信為代表從可公訴罪行的得益的財產」，最高可判處監禁14年及罰款500萬元。

就議員的提問，經諮詢教育局後，現回覆如下：

（一）根據警方最新數字，二○二五年首八個月共接獲28 379宗騙案，損失金額為50.2億元，較去年同期分別下跌1%及14.5%；當中涉及專上院校本地學生和內地學生的電話騙案分別為184宗及86宗，損失金額分別約為3,200萬元及7,500萬元。警方未有就學生涉及網絡詐騙的個案數字作分類備存。此外，警方暫時未觀察到針對海外學生的騙案有明顯趨勢，因此沒有就此作分類統計。

損失金額最高一宗發生於二○二五年四月的假冒官員電話騙案，損失超過1,000萬港元。受害人為一名25歲內地大學生，於二○二五年四月至七月期間按騙徒指示將1,097萬元分多次存入多個指定的本地銀行帳戶。警方於同年七月拘捕兩名內地男子，並已起訴兩人共三項「洗黑錢」罪。

（二）警方持續分析最新涉及學生的電話及網絡詐騙案形勢及情報，並定期發放最新的防騙信息，包括透過記者會、警隊官方社交媒體帳號、守網者網站等平台向學生及公眾介紹最新騙案手法。

警方注意到近來涉及學生的電話騙案多涉及假冒外賣平台發送釣魚短訊，指示受害人致電「假客服」，再誘騙其支付保證金以取消訂單。至於網絡詐騙案方面，不少詐騙集團透過Facebook、Instagram、WhatsApp等平台，誘使學生參與虛假的「刷單」活動。警方反詐騙協調中心即時加強在網站及相關社交媒體平台發出防騙警示，呼籲公眾切勿回撥短訊內的電話，如有懷疑應聯繫外賣平台的官方客戶服務中心核實，並鼓勵他們善用警方的「防騙視伏App」及「防騙易熱線」。

為加強防範學生及公眾誤墮電話及網絡詐騙陷阱，警方一直與電訊服務及社交媒體平台營辦商保持緊密溝通合作，包括透過電訊商派發防騙宣傳單張，並會不時更新防騙宣傳材料，提醒市民防範最新騙案手法。如發現有懷疑詐騙內容，警方會要求有關社交媒體平台即時移除，並採取適當的跟進行動。二○二五年一月至八月，有關平台已按警方要求，檢視及移除超過67 000個詐騙內容。另外，警方於二○二五年八月與Facebook及WhatsApp的母公司Meta舉行聯合記者會，發布涉及通訊軟件及社交網絡平台的最新騙案手法，以及營辦商的反詐措施，包括加強使用人工智能技術偵測和移除詐騙內容及帳號。

（三）教育局及大學教育資助委員會一直鼓勵各院校透過不同渠道向學生推廣防騙資訊，並為學生提供適當的支援。為提高本地、內地及海外學生的防騙意識和警覺性，各院校透過舉辦家長講座、入學簡介會、設立資訊專頁和專責熱線等提供防騙及反詐騙的資料。

有見及內地學生因為不熟悉本港的制度、騙案情況、求助方法等，較容易成為騙徒的目標，警務處處長早前已透過全港大專院校去信新來港學生及其家長，呼籲特別留意及防範常見的騙案手法，並鼓勵他們善用警方「防騙易熱線」及「防騙視伏App」。警方早前亦與國家移民管理局、公安部刑事偵查局及香港入境事務處共同製作防騙視頻，展示騙徒常用的犯案手法，並自二○二五年六月起在各口岸、內地出入境辦證大廳，以及小紅書、抖音等社交媒體播放。警方亦與國家教育部留學服務中心協作，在內地舉辦多場分享會，向超過11 000名留學生及家長講解防騙資訊。此外，警方與不同院校的內地生團體合辦活動和講座，以及透過他們發放防騙資訊。

警方亦已推出「網上學習套件」，本地、內地及海外學生須觀看圖文和影片教學，了解騙案手法和應對建議，回答多項選擇題，及格者可獲發電子證書。為應對二○二五年新學年前後學生騙案的高峰期，警方已推出新版網上學習問卷，備有繁體中文、簡體中文及英文版本，涵蓋電話騙案、投資騙案、求職騙案手法和警方反詐騙協調中心資訊。香港多間院校已要求本地、內地及海外學生於新學年必須按時完成該學習套件或問卷方可使用校園設施（如圖書館和學習空間）。

此外，警方於新學年前後舉辦超過30場防騙教育講座和活動，吸引超過4 000名本地、內地及海外學生參與，當中包括加強宣傳網上學習套件，並安排「乖巧寶寶防騙主題車」走訪專上院校，向學生及教職員傳遞防騙信息等。

警方早前與個別院校合作進行有關大學生詐騙認知的調查，收集逾3 000份回覆，發現近85%受訪者曾參與「網上學習套件」，而曾完成該學習套件的學生遭遇詐騙而有金錢損失的比率比未曾參與者低58個百分點。警方會繼續鼓勵專上院校的本地、內地及海外學生參與。

（四）因應社會的轉變和資訊科技的發展，教育局持續檢視和優化課程，與媒體和資訊素養教育和防騙意識相關的學習元素均蘊含在中小學的課程中，例如小學人文科、初中公民、經濟與社會科和高中公民與社會發展科課程均包含資訊素養、謹慎辨析資訊真偽和處理個人資料，以及防範網絡陷阱和風險等學習內容，幫助學生學會慎思明辨，提升自我保護意識。此外，教育局亦為學校提供《香港學生資訊素養》學習架構，以加強學校課程中與資訊素養相關的學習元素，推動學生健康地使用互聯網、保護個人私隱及裝備他們事實查證的技巧，提高學生的防騙意識和能力。

為加強教師對科技罪案資訊、數據保安的認識，指導學生安全及正確使用互聯網，教育局持續提供教師專業發展課程，支援學校推動資訊素養教育。教育局亦舉辦家長講座，協助家長培養子女在日常生活合乎道德地使用創新科技，包括懂得保護個人私隱，養成運用資訊科技的良好習慣。

針對幼稚園及中小學的青少年防騙意識和能力方面，教育局與警方協作編製教材，以提升學生在應用新興科技時的安全意識，避免誤墮陷阱。其中，警方自二○二二年起連續四年出版《青少年罪行誌．師長攻略》，為教師及家長提供一套實用的工具教導學生常見罪行及應對方法。

警方亦連續兩年出版教育漫畫特刊《黑金陷阱》及《黑白分明》，講解「租、借、賣戶口」的洗黑錢陷阱，並提供「師長攻略」專章，提供實用指引協助師長識別青少年涉案的徵兆。為了讓家長掌握最新的網絡陷阱手法和趨勢，警方定期透過「守網者」網頁推出「給家長的信」，以真實案例講解青少年和兒童可能面對的高危網絡陷阱，並向家長提供建議，以提升辨識及應對網絡陷阱的能力。

此外，警方自二○二○年起推出防騙吉祥物「提子」，以親民互動的方式解釋騙徒的最新犯案手法及提供簡單易明的防騙信息，並在各社交媒體平台上發布以「提子」為題的防騙資訊，如《提子動畫廊》繪本等，亦安排「提子」在線下與青少年及中、小學生互動，以宣揚防騙信息，包括安排「提子入校園」，並以防騙宣傳車走訪中小學校園。警方亦推出以幼兒為對象的《提子與我：提防騙子》繪本，向全港近1 000間幼稚園派發，幫助小童從小建立防騙意識。

未來，政府將繼續聯同幼稚園、中小學、專上院校及相關持份者合作，並會持續透過不同渠道，收集不同持份者的意見，以回饋課程策劃和實施，加強學生的防騙意識。科技日新月異，騙徒的手法層出不窮，政府將持續分析最新騙案形勢及情報，並按需要檢視和調整我們的反詐工作。"
LCQ1: Preventing students from falling victim to scams and pitfalls,2025-10-08 12:48,2025-10-08 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800341.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Duncan Chiu and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

It is reported that according to the latest figures from the Police, there were 327 telephone scam cases involving Mainland students last year, resulting in an aggregate loss exceeding $230 million. On average, each student victim was defrauded of over $700,000. Furthermore, a recent case involved a Hong Kong university student from the Mainland who is suspected to have suffered a financial loss after falling victim to a telephone scam involving the impersonation of government officials, before subsequently jumping to her death. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following information regarding scam cases involving students in the first nine months of this year: (i) the number of telephone and cyber scam cases involving local, Mainland and overseas students, (ii) the total amount of money defrauded, along with the highest individual amount, and (iii) the main countries or regions of origin of the overseas students who fell victim to these scams;

(2) whether it has conducted an analysis of telephone and cyber scam cases involving students, including the deception tactics employed by fraudsters and the communication software or social networking platforms involved; if so, of the findings of such analysis and the countermeasures that the authorities will adopt, including whether they will work with local commercial entities, such as mobile network and social networking platform operators, to introduce enhanced measures to prevent students from falling victim to telephone and cyber scams and pitfalls; if so, the specific details;

(3) whether it will consult with various local universities and formulate effective measures to strengthen awareness of telephone and cyber scam prevention among local, Mainland and overseas students, including requiring students to attend designated seminars on scam prevention and pass relevant assessments upon admission; and

(4) whether the authorities have reviewed the current anti-scam promotional efforts and their effectiveness in kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, and universities, with a view to enhancing young people's awareness of and capability in scam prevention; whether the authorities have set specific targets to determine which anti-scam initiatives require further enhancement and updating, and formulated a timetable for implementing various enhancement measures?

Reply:

President,

Deception is a serious crime. Any person who commits the offence of ""fraud"" under Section 16A of the Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210) is liable to imprisonment for up to 14 years, while any person charged with ""obtaining property by deception"" under Section 17 of the same Ordinance is liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years. In addition, any person charged with ""dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" under Section 25 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) for proceeds of deception is liable to maximum penalties of 14 years' imprisonment and a fine of $5 million.

In consultation with the Education Bureau (EDB), the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) According to the latest figures from the Police, there were a total of 28 379 scam cases, involving monetary loss of $5.02 billion, in the first eight months of 2025, which represent a decrease of 1 per cent and 14.5 per cent respectively when compared with the same period last year. Among them, there were 184 and 86 telephone scam cases involving local and Mainland students of tertiary institutions. The monetary losses incurred were approximately $32 million and $75 million respectively. The Police do not maintain statistical figures on the number of cyber scam cases involving students. Furthermore, as the Police do not observe an evident trend of scams targeting overseas students at this stage, a statistical breakdown is not maintained.

The case with the highest amount of loss was a telephone scam in April 2025 involving impersonation of government officials, resulting in a loss of over $10 million. The victim, a 25-year-old university student from the Mainland, followed the instructions of fraudsters by making multiple deposits totalling $10.97 million into a number of designated local bank accounts during the period between April and July 2025. In July of the same year, the Police arrested two Mainland males, who were subsequently charged with three counts of money laundering.

(2) The Police have been analysing the latest trends and intelligence of telephone and cyber scams involving students, and have been regularly releasing the latest anti-scam messages. For example, the Police make use of press conferences, social media accounts of the Police and platforms such as the CyberDefender website to warn students and the public about the latest scam tactics.

It has come to the Police's attention that recently many students have become victims of telephone scams involving fake food delivery platforms sending phishing SMS messages, instructing victims to call a fake ""customer service"" and then tricking them into paying ""guarantee money"" to cancel orders. As regards cyber scams, scam syndicates have been luring students into participating in fake ""click farming"" tasks through social media groups including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The Anti-Deception Coordination Centre (ADCC) of the Police has immediately stepped up dissemination of anti-scam alerts on websites and social media platforms, urging the public not to call back by clicking on the telephone numbers provided in the SMS messages. If in doubt, they should contact the official customer service centre of the food delivery platforms for verification. They are also encouraged to make good use of the Police's ""Scameter+"" and ""Anti-Scam Helpline"".

To heighten the alertness of students and the public against telephone and online scams and pitfalls, the Police have been maintaining close communication and collaboration with telecommunications service providers (TSP) and social media platform operators. In particular, anti-scam promotional leaflets are distributed through TSPs. The promotional materials are updated from time to time, so as to remind members of the public to be watchful over the latest scam tactics. Should suspected fraudulent content be found, the Police will request the social media platforms concerned to immediately remove the content and take appropriate follow-up actions. From January to August of 2025, the platforms concerned have reviewed and removed over 67 000 items of fraudulent content at the request of the Police. In addition, the Police held a joint press conference with Meta, the parent company of Facebook and WhatsApp, in August 2025 to alert the public of the latest scam tactics involving messaging applications and social networking platforms. The public were also notified of the operators' anti-scam countermeasures, which include the strengthened use of artificial intelligence technology for detecting and removing fraudulent content and accounts.

(3) The EDB and the University Grants Committee have been encouraging tertiary institutions to promote anti-scam information to students through various channels and provide students with appropriate support. To raise the anti-scam awareness and vigilance of local, Mainland and overseas students, institutions have provided them with scam prevention and anti-scam information through channels such as seminars for parents, admission briefings, dedicated webpages and dedicated hotlines.

Mainland students are more prone to become scam victims because they are unfamiliar with Hong Kong's systems, fraud situation and ways of seeking help. In this connection, the Commissioner of Police has earlier on sent a letter to the newly arrived students and their parents via all tertiary institutions in Hong Kong, urging them to pay particular attention to several common scam tactics and advising them of ways to guard against scams. They are also encouraged to make good use of the Police's ""Anti-Scam Helpline"" and ""Scameter+"". Earlier on, in collaboration with the National Immigration Administration, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security and the Immigration Department of Hong Kong, the Police have produced anti-scam video clips showing the modus operandi of fraudsters. Starting from June 2025, the videos are broadcast across boundary control points, exit-entry service halls in the Mainland as well as social media platforms including Xiaohongshu and Douyin. The Police also collaborated with the Chinese Service Center for Scholarly Exchange to organise sharing sessions in the Mainland, sharing anti-scam knowledge with over 11 000 students coming to Hong Kong for studies and their parents. Furthermore, the Police have disseminated anti-scam information to students through activities and seminars organised jointly with Mainland students' groups in various institutions.

The Police have also launched an online learning package. Local, Mainland and overseas students will have to learn about scam tactics and be given advice on countermeasures through the tutorials in the forms of texts, images and videos. They will then have to complete the multiple choice questions provided. Those who have passed the test will receive an e-certificate. To cope with the peak of scams involving students around the new academic year of 2025, the Police have launched an updated version of the online learning questionnaire in traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese and English, covering scam tactics such as telephone deception, investment fraud and employment fraud, as well as information provided by the ADCC of the Police. A number of institutions in Hong Kong have required local, Mainland and overseas students to complete the learning package or questionnaire within specified time frames in the new academic year in order to gain access to campus facilities (such as libraries and learning commons).

Furthermore, the Police organised over 30 scam prevention educational seminars and activities around the start of the new academic year, which have attracted the participation of more than 4 000 local, Mainland and overseas students. The activities included stepping up promotion of the online learning package and arranging visits to tertiary institutions by the Quby themed anti-scam promotional truck to disseminate anti-scam messages to students and staff.

The Police have collaborated with an institution to conduct a survey on the awareness of scam among university students. Of the 3 000-odd replies collected, it was found that nearly 85 per cent of the respondents had enrolled in the anti-scam online learning package. For students who had completed the learning package, the number who fell prey to scams and suffered monetary loss were 58 percentage points lower than those who had never enrolled in the learning package. The Police will continue to encourage the participation of local, Mainland and overseas students of tertiary institutions.

(4) In keeping with societal changes and technology development, the EDB continues to review and optimise the school curriculum. Learning elements relating to media and information literacy education as well as anti-scam awareness have been incorporated into primary and secondary school curricula. For example, Primary Humanities, Junior Secondary Citizenship, Economics and Society, and Senior Secondary Citizenship and Social Development have all included learning contents of information literacy, prudence in analysing the authenticity of information, handling of personal data, as well as guarding against cyber pitfalls and risks. This helps students to develop critical thinking and enhance their self protection awareness. In addition, the Information Literacy for Hong Kong Students, a learning framework provided to schools by the EDB, helps enrich the information literacy-related learning elements in the school curriculum, through which students are encouraged to use the Internet in a healthy manner, safeguard their personal privacy and equip themselves with fact checking skills, thereby enhancing their anti-scam awareness and ability.

To deepen teachers' knowledge of technology crime information and data security, enabling them to guide students in the safe and proper use of Internet, the EDB continuously launches professional development programmes for teachers and supports the promotion of information literacy education in schools. The EDB also organises seminars for parents, helping them nurture their children's ethical use of innovative technology in their everyday life, such as properly protecting personal privacy and developing good habits in using information technology.

To raise the awareness and capability of kindergarteners and young people of primary and secondary schools in scam prevention, the EDB and the Police have jointly designed teaching materials to enhance students' safety awareness in using new technology, which helps them avoid falling prey to scams. Among others, the Police have published the Youth Crime Prevention Booklet for four years in a row starting from 2022, offering a set of practical tools for teachers and parents to educate students about the common crimes and ways to deal with them.

The Police have also published the educational comic booklets titled ""The Dirty Money Trap"" and ""Black and White"" for two consecutive years, explaining the money laundering pitfalls associated with ""renting, borrowing and selling of bank accounts"". A dedicated chapter titled ""Tips for Teachers and Parents"" is also featured, offering practical guidance to help teachers and parents identify signs of young people's involvement in such crimes. To keep parents informed of the latest modus operandi and trends of cyber pitfalls, the Police regularly publish ""Letters to Parents"" on the ""CyberDefender"" website. Using real-life examples, these letters explain high-risk cyber pitfalls that young people and children may encounter and offer advice to parents, hence enhancing their capability in recognising and coping with cyber pitfalls.

In addition, the Police have introduced an anti-scam mascot ""The Little Grape"" since 2020 to explain the latest tactics of fraudsters and disseminate simple anti-scam messages in a friendly and interactive manner. Anti-scam information is also posted on different social media platforms using ""The Little Grape"" as the theme, such as ""The Little Grape"" Animation Picture book. Also, through offline interaction between ""The Little Grape"" and primary and secondary students, such as visits to primary and secondary schools by ""The Little Grape"" and the anti-scam promotional vehicle, anti-scam messages are conveyed to young people. A picture book named ""The Little Grape and Me: Beware of fraudsters"" targeting kindergarteners has also been released, with copies distributed to nearly 1 000 kindergartens across the territory with a view to cultivating anti-scam awareness in young children.

Going forward, the Government will continue to collaborate with kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools, tertiary institutions and stakeholders. Stakeholders' views are collected regularly through various channels to provide feedback on curriculum planning and implementation, with a view to strengthening students' awareness in scam prevention. In response to the advancing technology and evolving tactics of fraudsters, the Government will analyse the latest scam landscape and intelligence in an ongoing manner, and will review and adjust our anti-scam work as necessary."

立法會二十題：保障本地工人的就業機會,2025-10-08 12:15,2025-10-08 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800272.htm,"​以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上顏汶羽議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

二○二五年《施政報告》提出措施以確保本地勞工優先就業。另一方面，政府自今年六月三十日起，在一般就業政策及輸入內地人才計劃下新增渠道，容許符合技術專才清單資格的人士來港從事八項人手短缺的技術工種。然而，有意見指出相關安排或對本地勞工的就業機會造成負面影響。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於二○二五年《施政報告》提出收緊補充勞工優化計劃（優化計劃）下侍應生及初級廚師的人手比例要求（即全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例為二比一），將現時以僱主所有申請職位為基礎的計算方式，改為按個別申請職位計算，政府有否統計，在現行優化計劃的人手比例要求下，本地勞工在個別工種所佔的比例為何；有否發現僱主透過聘用不同工種或以兼職形式聘用本地勞工以達到優化計劃的人手比例要求；若有發現有關情況，政府現行的監察機制及改善措施為何；

（二）會否考慮將第（一）項所述的收緊人手比例要求的安排擴展至更多職位類別，並研究禁止僱主利用兼職形式聘用本地勞工以達到人手比例要求；

（三）鑑於二○二五年《施政報告》提出加大力度打擊非法勞工，包括設立舉報專線及推動更多跨部門聯合行動，政府就上述措施的具體計劃及預期成效為何；

（四）據悉近年有不法分子透過社交平台（例如小紅書）招攬生意後安排黑工來港提供服務，並安排黑工於隱蔽地點工作，過去一年政府就打擊非法勞工共進行了多少次突擊巡查，以及該等執法行動的成效為何，包括該等行動中被捕的非法勞工及僱主數目，以及提出的檢控宗數為何；

（五）就上述技術專才清單所新增的八項技術工種，至今各工種的申請人數及已批出配額分別為何；有否計劃根據本地培訓進度及人力供應情況，動態調整各工種配額；如否，會否考慮設立可加可減機制，以避免配額過多並保障本地技術人員就業；及

（六）政府有否掌握各類人才入境計劃來港人士的受養人（包括符合技術專才清單資格的來港人士）在港就業的情況，包括其從事的工種、收入水平及學歷背景等資料，以及有否評估該等受養人的就業情況對本地勞動市場的影響；政府在進行人力推算或人口統計時，會否統計該等受養人的資料以評估相關人力供求的趨勢；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府的人力政策一直以培育本地人才為主，引入外來人才為輔。面對產業轉型及人口持續高齡化，政府自二○二二年底推出多項「搶人才」措施，壯大本地人才庫。政府亦在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，於二○二三年加強輸入勞工的機制，為建造業、運輸業，以及安老院和殘疾人士院舍推出行業輸入勞工計劃，並推行補充勞工優化計劃（優化計劃），適度容許僱主確實未能在本地聘得合適人手時申請輸入勞工。根據《入境條例》（第115章），這些輸入勞工在港期間不會被視為通常居於香港，因此他們不會憑藉輸入勞工身分在港逗留而獲得香港永久性居民身分。政府一直密切監察就業市場的情況，適時及針對性地調整輸入勞工的執行安排，並大力打擊非法勞工，確保本地工人優先就業及維持人力供應，以支持香港的經濟發展。

二○二五年，政府針對人力極短缺的指定技術工種在一般就業政策及輸入內地人才計劃下新增渠道，容許年輕及具經驗的非學位專才來港，補充本地勞動力。經這兩個渠道來港的職業專才可累積在港居住年數，日後如符合《入境條例》訂明的相關資格可申請成為香港永久性居民，因此與輸入勞工有本質上的區別，不宜混為一談。

就議員的提問，經諮詢保安局及政府統計處後，現答覆如下：

（一）及（二）優化計劃規定，申請輸入勞工的僱主必須符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例（人手比例），一般須已聘用兩名全職本地僱員，方可獲准輸入一名勞工。全職僱員是指僱主直接僱用而每周總工作時數不少於35小時以經營相關業務的所有本地僱員，不包括兼職僱員、向僱主提供服務的外判商員工或自僱人士。

行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》宣布新措施，其中包括由今年九月十八日起就侍應生及初級廚師兩個申請職位實行更嚴格的二比一人手比例規定，由以每名申請僱主的所有職位為基礎計算，改為以申請職位計算。換言之，僱主申請輸入侍應生及初級廚師各一名，便須已聘用本地全職侍應生及初級廚師各兩名。新措施聚焦於輸入勞工較多的指定工種，針對該行業勞動力市場的變化，務求確保本地工人優先就業。

僱主提交優化計劃申請時，必須如實呈報全職本地僱員人數。如僱主於申請期間明知而作出或罔顧實情地作出虛假或有誤導性的陳述，即屬違法，可被檢控。勞工處嚴謹審批每宗申請，確保申請符合優化計劃的規定。審批過程中，勞工處會全面審視僱主遞交的文件及資料，並考慮其行業和業務性質、公司規模、申請職位詳情和過往申請紀錄等因素，如有需要，會要求僱主提交進一步資料或證明文件，或安排勞工督察巡查僱主的辦事處和擬輸入勞工的工作地點，核實其申請資料。

獲批准輸入勞工的僱主亦須持續符合人手比例要求的規定。勞工處今年六月進行特別巡查行動，到聘用輸入勞工的企業查核僱主有否持續符合人手比例的規定；並按違規風險，要求僱主申報全職本地僱員及輸入勞工的資料和相關人手比例。勞工處絕不姑息任何違規行為，如有足夠證據，會施加行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准，以及拒絕處理僱主隨後提交的其他申請，禁制期可達兩年。

今年八月底，經優化計劃在港工作的輸入勞工約35 000人，佔香港的勞動人口約1%。政府沒有本地勞工在個別工種所佔比例的統計資料。

政府會繼續密切監察本地勞工市場及各行業人力情況的變化，如有需要，會靈活及精準地調整優化計劃的實施安排。

（三）及（四）政府一直致力打擊非法勞工，從而保障本地工人的就業機會。從事非法工作屬嚴重罪行，非法勞工、僱主，以及協助和教唆他人從事非法工作的人士均會根據《入境條例》被檢控。

在加強情報收集和嚴格執法方面，各執法部門一直主動搜集情報，對懷疑有非法工作的場所進行聯合行動。根據入境事務處（入境處）的記錄，二○二五年一月至八月期間打擊非法勞工的執法行動（包括與警務處等部門進行聯合行動）次數，較二○二四年月均數字上升5.1%，有關數字表列如下：

​針對不法之徒利用網上平台招攬和安排非法勞工來港，入境處的網絡罪案及法證調查小組持續進行網上巡邏。如發現有人利用社交平台或即時通訊軟件組織、安排、慫恿市民干犯聘用非法勞工等嚴重罪行，會以「放蛇」等方式展開執法行動。如當中涉及內地網上平台，入境處會與內地當局交換情報，並促請內地當局與相關平台作適當跟進，包括下架涉事的帖文。例如入境處於今年八月下旬至九月初，透過網上巡邏留意到有內地攝影師及化妝師利用社交平台宣傳，聲稱可以在香港提供服務。入境處經調查及採取「放蛇」行動後，合共拘捕10人，包括八名內地非法勞工。

此外，入境處於二○二五年《施政報告》公布同日（九月十七日）推出舉報非法勞工專線（3861 5000），鼓勵市民積極舉報非法勞工相關行為。舉報專線推出首兩星期，入境處已收到過百宗電話舉報。入境處會廣泛宣傳舉報專線，積極跟進每宗舉報，包括按情報分析採取執法行動。

為進一步加大力度打擊非法勞工，保安局於二○二五年九月成立跨部門反黑工專責組（專責組），成員包括勞工及福利局、教育局、運輸及物流局、入境處、警務處、勞工處和運輸署。專責組已於二○二五年十月二日召開首次會議，討論非法勞工的現況，並同意透過制定應對非法勞工的整體策略、強化情報搜集及與內地情報交換、嚴厲執法、善用科技，以及協調相關宣傳和教育等方面加強跨部門協調，多管齊下打擊非法勞工。專責組會繼續密切留意非法勞工的情況，並適時制定整體應對策略，以保障本地勞工就業。

（五）政府自二○二五年六月三十日起在一般就業政策及輸入內地人才計劃下增設技術專才類別，容許外來人士申請來港投身八項人力極短缺的技術工種，申請者須為符合技術專才清單」列明資格的非學位專才，年齡介乎18至40歲。按照一般就業政策及輸入內地人才計劃的現行規定，相關技術專才須在申請前先獲得本地企業聘任，其薪酬待遇亦須達同類工作的市場水平。新增渠道為期三年，設有共10 000個申請名額，當中每項技術工種的申請名額以3 000個為限，以避免個別行業規模較大的技術工種迅速佔用絕大部分配額。有關限額並非政府引入個別技術工種的人數目標。

入境處已陸續收到查詢，並正審批接獲的申請。新安排實施至今僅三個月，政府正密切留意推行情況，稍後會適時公布有關統計數字，並會在新安排推行一年後進行檢討。

（六）政府統計處在進行人口及勞動人口推算時，會綜合考慮當時各項人才計劃下獲批簽證的人士及其受養人的抵港數目及人口特徵，以推算人口及勞動人口的長遠發展趨勢。政府統計處進行的住戶統計調查（包括二○二六年人口普查）亦涵蓋在港居住的新來港人士的就業情況，當中包括獲批簽證的人才及其受養人。另外，勞工及福利局會持續關注受養人在港的就業情況，例如透過網上問卷調查等方式，收集高端人才通行證計劃受養人的教育背景、就業狀況及就業意向等，所得資料將納入人力推算中期更新的模型作參考。上述資料有助政府更全面了解受養人在本地勞動市場的情況。"
LCQ20: Safeguarding employment opportunities for local workers,2025-10-08 12:15,2025-10-08 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800278.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Ngan Man-yu and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  The 2025 Policy Address has proposed measures to ensure employment priority of local workers. On the other hand, the Government has, since June 30 this year, introduced a new channel under the General Employment Policy and the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals, allowing individuals meeting the qualifications under the Technical Professional List to come to Hong Kong to engage in eight skilled trades facing manpower shortage. However, there are views pointing out that the relevant arrangements may create negative impacts on the employment opportunities for local workers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the 2025 Policy Address has proposed to tighten the manning ratio requirement for waiters/waitresses and junior cooks under the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) (i.e. a manning ratio of 2:1 for full-time local employees to imported workers), and change the current calculation method based on all posts being applied for by employers to the one based on individual posts being applied for, whether the Government has compiled statistics on the proportion of local workers in individual trades under the existing manning ratio requirement of ESLS; whether it has identified employers hiring local workers in different trades or on a part-time basis to meet the manning ratio requirement of ESLS; if such cases have been identified, of the Government's existing monitoring mechanisms and improvement measures;

(2) whether it will consider extending the arrangement for tightening the manning ratio requirement mentioned in (1) to more post categories, and study prohibiting employers from hiring local workers on a part-time basis to meet the manning ratio requirement;

(3) given that the 2025 Policy Address has proposed to step up efforts to combat illegal workers, including establishing a dedicated reporting hotline and promoting more inter-departmental joint operations, of the Government's specific plans and expected effectiveness in respect of the aforesaid measures;

(4) as it is learnt that in recent years, some lawbreakers have arranged for illegal workers to come to Hong Kong to provide services after soliciting business through social media platforms (such as Xiaohongshu), and then arranged for such illegal workers to work in concealed locations, of the total number of surprise inspections conducted by the Government to combat illegal workers in the past year and the effectiveness of such enforcement actions, including the number of illegal workers and employers arrested in such actions, as well as the number of prosecutions instituted;

(5) regarding the eight newly added skilled trades on the aforesaid Technical Professional List, of the respective numbers of applicants and approved quotas for each trade to date; whether it has plans to dynamically adjust the quotas for each trade based on the progress of local training and manpower supply; if not, whether it will consider establishing a mechanism which allows both additions and deductions to avoid excessive quotas and safeguard employment for local skilled personnel; and

(6) whether the Government has grasped Hong Kong's employment situation in respect of dependants of individuals coming to Hong Kong under various talent admission schemes (including individuals coming to Hong Kong who meet the qualifications under the Technical Professional List), including information such as the trades in which they engaged, their income levels and educational backgrounds, and whether it has assessed the impacts of the employment situation of such dependants on the local labour market; whether the Government will compile statistics on the information of such dependants when conducting manpower projections or population censuses, so as to assess the relevant manpower supply and demand trends; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The primary objective of the Government's manpower policy is to nurture local talent, complemented by admission of outside talent. In the face of industrial transformation and a continuously ageing population, the Government has implemented a host of measures to proactively trawl for talent since end-2022 to expand the talent pool. On the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, the Government also enhanced the mechanism for importation of labour in 2023 and launched sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction sector, transport sector, and residential care homes for the elderly and residential care homes for persons with disabilities, as well as the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) to suitably allow employers to apply for importation of workers when they are genuinely unable to recruit suitable local workers. According to the Immigration Ordinance (Cap. 115) (IO), the period of stay of these imported workers in Hong Kong is not regarded as ordinarily residing in Hong Kong and hence they would not obtain the Hong Kong permanent resident status by virtue of their stay as imported workers in Hong Kong. The Government has been closely monitoring the employment market, and making timely and targeted adjustments to the implementation arrangements for labour importation as well as combating illegal workers rigorously, so as to ensure employment priority for local workers and maintain labour supply to support Hong Kong's economic development.

  In 2025, the Government introduced a new channel under the General Employment Policy (GEP) and the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP) targeting specified skilled trades facing acute manpower shortage to allow young and experienced non-degree professionals to come to Hong Kong to replenish the local labour force. Vocational professionals admitted to Hong Kong through these two channels may accumulate years of residence in Hong Kong and apply to become Hong Kong permanent residents in future if meeting the specified eligibility criteria under the IO. They are therefore fundamentally different from imported workers and the two should not be conflated together.

  In consultation with the Security Bureau (SB) and the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) ESLS requires employers applying for importation of labour to meet the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers (manning ratio requirement). In general, employers shall have employed two full-time local workers for bringing in one imported worker. Full time employees refer to local employees who are directly employed by an employer and work not less than 35 hours per week for operating the relevant business, excluding part time staff, staff of sub contractor(s) or self employed person(s) providing services to the employer.

  The Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address new measures, including implementing from September 18 this year a more stringent manning ratio requirement of 2:1 when employers apply for the posts of waiter/waitress and junior cook by changing the calculation basis of applying the ratio from all posts of an applicant employer to each post under application. In other words, an employer applying to import a waiter/waitress and a junior cook must have already employed two local full-time waiters/waitresses and two local full-time junior cooks. The new measure focuses on job categories with more imported workers, responding to changes in the labour market of that industry in a targeted manner with a view to ensuring priority employment for local workers.

  Employers shall truthfully report the number of full-time local employees when submitting ESLS applications. An employer knowingly or recklessly makes a statement which is false or misleading during the application commits an offence and is liable to prosecution. The Labour Department (LD) rigorously processes each application to ensure compliance with ESLS requirements. During the vetting process, the LD thoroughly reviews the documents and information submitted by an employer, and takes into account factors such as the industry of the employer and business nature, company size, details of applied posts and past application records. If necessary, the LD will require an employer to provide additional information or supporting documents, or arrange Labour Inspectors to conduct inspection to an employer's office and workplace(s) of prospective imported worker(s) to verify the application information.

  Employers with approval to import workers shall meet the manning ratio requirement on a continuous basis. The LD launched a special inspection campaign in June this year to check whether establishments employing imported workers had continuously met the manning ratio requirement. The LD also requires employers to report information on full-time local employees and imported workers as well as the relevant manning ratios based on a risk-based approach. The LD does not tolerate any acts of non-compliance and will impose administrative sanction if there is sufficient evidence, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of workers previously granted to the employer(s) and refusal to process other subsequent applications with a debarment period up to two years.

  As at end-August this year, there were around 35 000 imported workers working in Hong Kong under ESLS, accounting for around 1 per cent of Hong Kong's labour force. The Government does not have statistical information on the proportion of local workers in individual job categories.

  The Government will continue to closely monitor changes in the local labour market and the manpower situation of different industries, and adopt a flexible and targeted approach in making adjustments to the implementation arrangements of ESLS if necessary.

(3) and (4) The Government is committed to combating illegal employment so as to safeguard employment opportunities of local workers. It is a serious offence to engage in illegal employment. Illegal workers, employers, as well as persons aiding and abetting illegal employment will be liable to prosecution in accordance with the IO.

  On strengthening intelligence collection and strict law enforcement, various law enforcement agencies have been proactively collecting intelligence and conducting joint operations to raid premises suspected of having illegal employment activities. According to the records of the Immigration Department (ImmD), the monthly average number of law enforcement operations against illegal workers (including joint operations with other departments including the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF)) conducted in January to August 2025 was 5.1 per cent more than that in 2024. The relevant figures are tabulated below:

Remark: Persons prosecuted may not be arrested in the same year.

  Targeting lawbreakers making use of online platforms to recruit and arrange illegal workers to come to Hong Kong, the Cybercrime and Forensics Investigation Group of the ImmD conducts constant cyber patrols. It will take enforcement actions by, among others, decoy operations against any person who is found using social media platforms or instant messaging software to organise, arrange or incite the public to commit serious crimes, such as illegal employment. If the Mainland online platforms are involved, the ImmD will exchange intelligence with the Mainland authorities and urge them to arrange with the relevant platforms for taking appropriate follow-up actions, such as taking down the posts involved. For example, in late August and early September this year, the ImmD noticed through cyber patrols that some Mainland photographers and make-up artists were promoting on social media platforms, claiming that they could provide services in Hong Kong. After investigation and conducting decoy operation, the ImmD arrested a total of 10 persons, including eight Mainland illegal workers.

  Besides, on the same day of the delivery of the 2025 Policy Address (September 17), the ImmD launched the Dedicated Hotline for Reporting Illegal Workers (3861 5000) in order to encourage the public to actively report illegal employment-related acts. In the first two weeks since the launch of the reporting hotline, the ImmD had already received over 100 telephone reports. The ImmD will widely promote the reporting hotline and actively follow up on each report, including taking enforcement actions based on intelligence analysis.

  To further step up efforts in combating illegal employment, the SB established in September 2025 an Inter-departmental Task Force against Illegal Employment (Task Force), including members from the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB), the Education Bureau, the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the ImmD, the HKPF, the LD and the Transport Department. The first meeting of the Task Force was convened on October 2, 2025, at which the Task Force discussed the current situation of illegal employment, and agreed to enhance inter-departmental coordination on various fronts, including formulating overall response strategies against illegal employment, enhancing intelligence collection and intelligence exchange with the Mainland, enforcing the laws rigorously, leveraging technology, and co-ordinating relevant publicity and education, so as to combat illegal employment under a multi-pronged approach. The Task Force will continue to closely monitor the situation of illegal employment and formulate overall response strategies in a timely manner to safeguard the employment of local workforce.

(5) The Government introduced the technical professionals stream under GEP and ASMTP from June 30, 2025 to allow outside individuals to apply for entry into Hong Kong to join eight skilled trades facing acute manpower shortage. Applicants are required to be non-degree professionals meeting the relevant qualifications as specified in the Technical Professional List and aged between 18 and 40. According to the prevailing requirements under GEP and ASMTP, relevant technical professionals are required to have secured an employment offer from a local enterprise before making applications, and the remuneration package should be commensurate with the market level for similar jobs. This new arrangement will be piloted for three years with an overall application quota of 10 000, and the application quota for each skilled trade is limited to 3 000 to prevent occupations with larger industry scales from quickly exhausting the quotas. The relevant quota does not represent the Government's target number for admitting technical professionals in individual skilled trades.

  The ImmD has been receiving enquiries and is processing the applications received. The new arrangement has only been in place for three months and the Government is closely monitoring its implementation. Relevant statistics will be released later at an opportune time, and a review will be conducted after the new arrangement has been implemented for a year.

(6) When conducting population and labour force projections, the C&SD takes into account the number and demographic characteristics of approved visa holders under various talent admission schemes and their dependents in assessing the long-term development trends of the population and labour force. The household surveys (including the 2026 Population Census) conducted by the C&SD also cover the employment situation of new arrivals living in Hong Kong, including approved visa holders and their dependents. Additionally, the LWB will continue to monitor the employment situation of dependents in Hong Kong. For example, we are collecting information through online surveys on the educational background, employment status and employment intentions, etc, of dependents admitted under the Top Talent Pass Scheme. The information obtained will be considered by the projection models of the mid-term update of the manpower projection. The above information helps the Government gain a more comprehensive understanding of the status of dependents in the local labour market."
LCQ15: Assisting members of the public in relieving stress,2025-10-08 12:10,2025-10-08 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800264.htm,"Following is a question by Professor the Hon Priscilla Leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  A research institute has recently announced that, according to the statistics of the Coroner's Court, the suicide rate in Hong Kong was estimated at 14.1 per 100 000 people last year. This represents an increase of 0.6 from 13.5 in 2023, which exceeds international standards. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will, in light of the latest situation, strengthen mental health and emotional support services in the community, as well as step up publicity and education efforts on social media to help citizens from diverse backgrounds relieve stress, so that they will know where to seek help; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as it has been reported that the suicide rate among males aged between 25 and 39 saw the most significant increase last year, with 28.6 per cent of male suicides attributed to financial problems such as debts, unemployment, gambling or business failures, whether the Government will consider collaborating with community organisations and professional bodies to provide targeted counselling services for male groups, assist them in channelling their emotions and formulate appropriate response plans; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as it has been reported that a Mainland university student studying in Hong Kong has recently fell to her death after allegedly falling victim to phone scams, whether the Government will consider further strengthening cooperation with tertiary institutions by not only enhancing students' awareness of fraud prevention, but also strengthening the emotional support services for Mainland and overseas students, with a view to enabling them to focus on their studies and enjoy a simple and positive campus life in Hong Kong; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Factors leading to suicide are multi-faceted, including emotional issues, personal health, interpersonal relationships and financial position. Each case varies and cannot be generalised. The Government attaches great importance to suicide prevention, and has been providing multi-tiered support through multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration among various policy bureaux and departments, public organisations, and other stakeholders within the community. These efforts aim to promote public education, identify high-risk groups, intervene early, and provide appropriate counselling and support services to individuals with suicidal tendencies and their families.

In consultation with the Health Bureau (HHB), the Education Bureau (EDB) and the Security Bureau, our reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) and (2)

Public education and promotion

In order to enhance public awareness of mental health, foster a positive mental health culture, and strengthen resilience, various departments have been implementing various public education and promotion programmes, including:

(i) The Labour and Welfare Bureau organises an annual Mental Health Month to raise public awareness of mental health through lectures, exhibitions, community activities, and workshops, etc, and convey positive messages, encouraging individuals to care for their own emotional well-being as well as that of others;

(ii) Apart from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) distributing promotional materials and broadcasting short videos, the 24 Integrated Community Centres for Mental Wellness (ICCMWs) under the SWD regularly organise different types of mutual support groups, as well as public education activities such as workshops and mobile exhibitions, to actively deliver positive messages, promote mental health knowledge, encourage the public to adopt a positive attitude towards seeking help and pay early attention to their mental health needs, with a view to strengthening resilience of the public. Specifically in response to the mental health challenges arising from work pressure, financial burdens and family responsibilities, faced by adults, including the middle-aged population, ICCMWs also organise mutual support groups and workshops specially for middle-aged men;

(iii) The Advisory Committee on Mental Health has launched a mental health promotion and public education initiative named ""Shall We Talk"" since July 2020. The initiative commits to promoting positive messages of mental health with a view to stepping up public knowledge and awareness of mental well-being and of seeking assistance from professionals when needed. The initiative delivers messages on mental health through different channels, including a one-stop website (shallwetalk.hk), a social media page, television and radio programmes, promotion posters, offline events such as road shows in tertiary education institutions, primary and secondary schools. Separately, the initiative disseminates information or knowledge and skills in suicide prevention and relevant information on ways to seek help provided in support of the World Suicide Prevention Day;

(iv) The EDB encourages schools to adopt a whole-school approach to promote students' mental health and strengthen support for students with mental health needs at three levels, namely Universal, Selective and Indicated through curriculum, resources, activities, training, and professional support. The EDB has been implementing the 4Rs Mental Health Charter since the 2024/25 school year. With ""Resilience"" being the core theme of the current school year, schools are encouraged to set targets and take concrete actions to promote mental wellness in campus and strengthen resilience of students.

In order to further strengthen community engagement and public education of mental health, the Government will implement the Pilot Programme on Training for Mental Health Promotion Ambassadors to mobilise and train mental health promotion ambassadors to promote healthy lifestyles, foster resilience and establish care support networks.

Identifying high-risk groups and early intervention

Identifying high-risk groups and providing targeted support services and early intervention helps reduce potential suicide risks. To that end, relevant departments implemented the following measures:

(i) HHB launched the Healthy Mind Pilot Project in 2024 at three District Health Centre (DHC)/District Health Centre Expresses to provide free preliminary mental health assessments at the community level. The pilot project aims to achieve the primary healthcare goal of ""early detection and early treatment"" and strengthen support for individuals in need. The Government will extend the pilot project in 2026 to cover nine DHCs, with follow-up services to be provided by practitioners with an academic background and training in fields such as psychology or counselling. The HHB also provided mental health first aid training to members of District Services and Community Care Teams to enhance their ability to identify and assist high-risk cases within the community;

(ii) The SWD has set up Cyber Youth Support Teams (CYSTs) to reach out to emotionally unstable youth or those with suicidal thoughts via social media and other online platforms, and provide emotional support, counselling and appropriate referral services. The SWD has enhanced the services of CYSTs in June 2025. Through the online youth emotional support platform ""Open Up"", CYSTs provide 24-hour real-time online counselling service for young people experiencing emotional distress and immediate crises, allowing them to receive support anytime, anywhere. The application of artificial intelligence will be strengthened for more precise identification of high-risk targets in need of support.

Crisis intervention for high-risk cases

Departments provide in-depth counselling and crisis intervention for high-risk cases with suicidal tendencies or mental health issues. Details are as follows:

(i) Currently, relevant departments and subvented organisations operate multiple hotlines to provide immediate support to individuals with suicidal tendencies or emotional distress, and encourage and refer them to relevant service units for in-depth counselling. These include the SWD Hotline (2343 2255), the crisis intervention and support hotline of the CEASE Crisis Centre under the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals (18281), the Caritas Crisis Line (18288), the Hotline Service for Youth at Risk (2777 8899), and the Designated Hotline for Carer Support (182183), as well as the ""18111 – Mental Health Support Hotline"" which provides one-stop, round-the-clock emotional and mental health support and referral for individuals regardless of background and age;

(ii) The 24 ICCMWs under the SWD provide emotional support, case management, and counselling services to individuals with mental health needs or suicidal tendencies. They work with the Hospital Authority and other welfare service units to provide immediate support and referrals for high-risk cases;

(iii) The Samaritan befrienders Hong Kong subvented by the SWD operates the Suicide Crisis Intervention Centre which offers outreaching, crisis intervention, and in-depth counselling services for individuals troubled by suicide-related issues (including male with financial stress and suicidal tendency). Also, the SWD subsidises Caritas Hong Kong and Tung Wah Group of Hospitals to provide specialised services, including counselling and advice, to enhance the resilience of persons with financial distress, as well as to refer them to receive relevant social services according to their needs, assist them in obtaining other necessary support and professional services, in order to support individuals and families suffering from emotional distress or family problems as a result of financial distress.

(iv) In order to identify students with high suicidal risk early and provide them with targeted support, the Government has implemented the Three-tier School-based Emergency Mechanism across all secondary schools in the territory through interdepartmental collaboration of the EDB, the HHB and the SWD starting from December 2023. This mechanism integrates in-school multidisciplinary teams, the off-campus support network, and medical services and has been enhanced in 2024. The Government announced regularising the three-tier emergency mechanism in secondary schools in the 2025/26 school year and extending it on a trial basis to Primary Four to Six students to strengthen support for those in need.

(3) The EDB and the University Grants Committee (UGC) pay close attention to the measures taken by post-secondary institutions in raising anti-scam awareness among students, and have maintained close liaison with them through the communication platform formed by university representatives. The institutions are encouraged to promote anti-scam messages to students through various channels. To raise non-local students' anti-scam awareness and vigilance, the institutions work closely with law enforcement agencies and local banks to disseminate information on anti-scam and fraud prevention through organising seminars for parents and admission talks, and setting up dedicated information webpages and hotlines, etc.

Since the new academic year of 2025, the Police have visited various universities to carry out anti-scam publicity campaigns. Earlier on, the Commissioner of Police has also sent a letter to the newly arrived students and their parents through all tertiary institutions in Hong Kong, urging them to pay particular attention to several common fraud tactics and advising them of ways to guard against such fraud. They are also encouraged to make good use of the Police's Anti-Scam Helpline and Scameter+. The Police have also launched an Online Learning Package. Local, Mainland and overseas students will have to learn about scam tactics and be given advice on counter measures through the tutorials in the forms of texts, images and videos. They will then have to complete the multiple choice questions provided. Those who have passed the test will receive an e-certificate. To cope with the peak of scams involving students around the new academic year of 2025, the Police have launched an updated version of the online learning questionnaire in traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese and English, covering scam tactics such as telephone deception, investment fraud and employment fraud, as well as information provided by the Anti-Deception Coordination Centre of the Police. Furthermore, the Police have organised over 30 scam prevention educational talks and seminars, and activities around the start of the new academic year, which have attracted the participation of more than 4 000 local, Mainland and overseas students. The activities included stepping up promotion of the online learning package and arranging visits to tertiary institutions by the Quby themed anti scam promotional truck to disseminate anti scam messages to students and staff.

UGC has been supporting the universities to promote mental health and positive education and strengthen various student support services, including counselling and mental health support. For the 2022/23 to 2024/25 triennium, UGC additionally allocated $30 million to establish the Whole-person Development Fund to support each UGC-funded university to organise projects that enrich students' learning experience outside the classroom, thereby promoting whole-person development among the younger generation. The promotion of positive education and psychological well-being was one of the four key areas. Apart from deploying funds to conduct different activities and peer support programmes, the universities also made use of the funds to strengthen the manpower for counselling to meet the service demands from students. In addition, the universities are utilising the additional allocation provided by UGC under the Funding Scheme for Mainland and Global Engagement and Student Learning Experience to organise activities for a multi-cultural campus, so as to promote exchanges between students from different backgrounds and cultures to create a diversified and inclusive international learning environment."
立法會十五題：協助市民紓緩壓力,2025-10-08 12:10,2025-10-08 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800256.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上梁美芬議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

答覆：

主席：

自殺涉及多項因素，例如情緒問題、個人健康、人際關係及財政狀況等，每宗個案均有不同，難以一概而論。政府非常重視預防自殺的工作，各決策局及部門、公營機構和社區內其他持份者以跨專業及跨界別合作的方式，提供多層次的支援，推動公共教育，識別較高風險群組並及早介入，為有自殺傾向的人士及其家屬提供適切的輔導和支援服務。

就議員的提問，經諮詢醫務衞生局（醫衞局）、教育局和保安局後，現答覆如下：

（一）及（二）

公眾教育與推廣

為提升公眾對精神健康的認識，促進正向心理健康文化，增強抗逆能力，各部門一直推行各項公眾教育與推廣活動，包括：

（i）勞工及福利局每年舉辦「精神健康月」，藉講座、展覽、社區活動及工作坊等提高市民對精神健康的關注，傳遞正面信息，鼓勵市民關注自身及身邊人的情緒健康；

（ii）社會福利署（社署）除了發放宣傳物品及播放短片外，該署轄下24間精神健康綜合社區中心（綜合社區中心）亦定期舉辦不同類型的互助小組、工作坊、流動展覽等公眾教育活動，積極傳遞正向信息，推廣精神健康知識，鼓勵大眾以正面態度求助、及早關注精神健康需要，以提升公眾的抗逆能力。針對成年人（包括中年人士）因工作壓力、經濟負擔及家庭責任而面臨的精神健康挑戰，綜合社區中心亦有特別舉辦中年男士互助小組和工作坊；

（iii）精神健康諮詢委員會於二○二○年七月起推出一個名為「陪我講Shall We Talk」的持續精神健康推廣和公眾教育計劃，致力宣傳精神健康的正面信息，以提升市民大眾對精神健康的認識及關注，並在有需要時尋求專業人士的協助。該計劃通過一站式網站（shallwetalk.hk）、社交媒體專頁、電視及電台節目、宣傳海報、線下活動（包括在大專院校、中小學舉行巡迴活動）等不同方式傳遞有關精神健康的訊息；並有配合世界防止自殺日而推出有關防止自殺的知識和技巧，以及相關求助的資訊；

（iv）教育局鼓勵學校採用全校參與模式，以「普及性」、「選擇性」、「針對性」三個層面，透過課程、資源、活動、培訓及專業支援等，促進學生的精神健康，以及加強支援有精神健康需要的學生。教育局於二○二四／二五學年推行《4Rs精神健康約章》，並於本學年以抗逆力作為核心主題，鼓勵學校訂立目標及採取具體行動，在校園推廣精神健康，強化所有學生的抗逆能力。

為進一步加強精神健康社區參與和公眾教育，政府將推行「精神健康推廣大使培訓先導計劃」，動員及培訓精神健康推廣大使推廣健康生活方式、培養抗逆力、構建關懷同行的支援網絡。

識別較高風險群組並及早介入

及早識別較高風險群組，提供針對性支援服務和早期干預，有助降低潛在自殺風險。就此，有關部門推行了以下措施：

（i）醫衞局於二○二四年在三個地區康健中心／康健站推出精神健康評估先導計劃，試行在社區層面為市民提供免費的精神健康初步評估，以達致發展基層醫療的「早發現、早治療」目標，加強為有需要人士提供適切支援。政府將會於二○二六年擴展先導計劃至九個中心，由具備心理學或輔導學等學歷背景及訓練的人員提供跟進服務。醫衞局亦為地區服務及關愛隊伍隊員提供精神健康急救培訓，提升其在社區中識別和協助高風險個案的能力；

（ii）社署已設立「網上青年支援隊」，透過社交媒體及其他網上平台接觸情緒不穩定或有自殺意念的青少年，為他們提供情緒支援、輔導及適切轉介服務。社署自今年六月起加強支援隊服務，通過青少年情緒健康網上支援平台「Open噏」，為有情緒困擾及即時危機的青少年提供24小時即時網上輔導服務，讓他們可以隨時隨地得到適切的支援，並將加強人工智能應用以更精準發掘風險高的支援對象。

高風險個案的危機干預

針對有自殺傾向或精神健康問題的高風險個案，各部門提供深入輔導和危機干預，詳情如下：

（i）現時有關部門及津助機構設有多條熱線，為有自殺傾向及受情緒困擾人士提供即時支援，並鼓勵及轉介他們到相關服務單位接受深入輔導，包括社署熱線（2343 2255）、東華三院芷若園危機介入及支援熱線（18281）、明愛向晴熱線（18288）、青年熱線服務（2777 8899）及照顧者支援專線（182183），以及「18111情緒通」24小時熱線，一站式為來自任何背景、任何年齡的市民提供情緒及精神健康支援和轉介；

（ii）社署轄下24間精神健康綜合社區中心為有精神健康需要或自殺傾向人士提供情緒支援、個案管理及輔導服務，並與醫院管理局及其他福利服務單位合作，為高風險個案提供即時支援及轉介；

（iii）由社署津助的香港撒瑪利亞防止自殺會營辦自殺危機處理中心，為自殺問題困擾的人士（包括因財務問題而有自殺傾向的男性）提供外展、危機介入及深入輔導服務。社署亦透過資助香港明愛及東華三院，提供專門服務，包括輔導及建議，以提升財困人士的抗逆力，並會按需要轉介他們接受相關的社會服務、協助獲取所需支援和其他專業服務，以支援因為財困而出現情緒／家庭問題的個人及家庭；

（iv）為及早識別和支援有高自殺風險學生並提供針對性支援，政府透過教育局、醫務衞生局和社會福利署跨部門協作，在二○二三年十二月開始在全港中學推行以學校為本的三層應急機制，結合校內跨專業團隊、校外支援網絡和醫療服務，並於二○二四年優化有關安排。政府已宣布於二○二五／二六學年恆常化在中學實施三層應急機制，並擴展至在小學四至六年級試行，加強支援有需要的學生。

（三）教育局及大學教育資助委員會（教資會）十分關注專上院校在提高學生防騙意識方面採取的措施，一直透過與各大學代表組成的溝通平台保持緊密聯繫，鼓勵各院校透過不同渠道向學生推廣防騙資訊。為提高非本地學生的防騙意識和警覺性，各院校積極與執法機構及本地銀行合作，透過舉辦家長講座、入學簡介會、設立資訊專頁和專責熱線等提供防騙及反詐騙的資料。

自二○二五年新學年開始，警方已走訪各大學進行反詐宣傳。警務處處長早前亦透過全港大專院校去信新來港學生及他們的家長，呼籲他們要特別留意幾類常見行騙手法，以及防範的方法，並鼓勵他們善用警方的「防騙易熱線」及「防騙視伏App」。警方亦已推出「網上學習套件」，本地、內地及海外學生須觀看圖文和影片教學，了解騙案手法和應對建議，回答多項選擇題，及格者可獲發電子證書。為應對二○二五年新學年前後學生騙案的高峰期，警方已推出新版網上學習問卷，備有繁體中文、簡體中文及英文版本，涵蓋電話騙案、投資騙案、求職騙案手法和警方反詐騙協調中心資訊。此外，警方於新學年前後舉辦超過30場防騙教育講座和活動，吸引超過4 000名本地、內地及海外學生參與，當中包括加強宣傳網上學習套件，並安排乖巧寶寶防騙主題車走訪專上院校，向學生及教職員傳遞防騙信息等。

教資會一直支持大學提倡精神健康和正向教育，並加強對學生的各類支援服務，包括心理輔導及精神健康支援。在二○二二／二三至二○二四／二五三年期，教資會增撥3,000萬元設立「全人發展基金」，支持各教資會資助大學舉辦豐富學生課外學習體驗的項目，從而推動年輕一代的全人發展，而推廣正向教育及心理健康屬四個主要範疇之一。大學除了運用撥款舉辦不同活動和朋輩支援計劃外，亦利用撥款加強心理輔導的人手，應付學生的服務需要。此外，大學亦正利用教資會提供的「內地與環球連繫及學習體驗資助計劃」的額外撥款，舉辦提倡多元校園文化的活動，推動不同背景及文化的學生增進交流，以締造多元共融的國際化學習環境。"

LCQ6: Installation of traffic signal systems at roundabouts,2025-10-08 12:00,2025-10-08 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800271.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Michael Tienand a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

It is learnt that since the installation of a traffic signal system at Pok Oi Roundabout in Yuen Long on February 9 this year, members of the public and motorists generally consider that the system has effectively eased traffic flow and significantly improved traffic conditions at the roundabout. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the comparisons of the following traffic data at Pok Oi Roundabout before and after the installation of the traffic signal system:
(i) the average traffic queue length (in metres) at each of the southbound and northbound entrances during peak hours (7am to 10am and 5pm to 8pm);
(ii) the time period during which the longest traffic queue occurred and its duration;
(iii) the average time taken for vehicles to pass through the roundabout; and
(iv) changes in the number of traffic incidents (set out by nature of the incidents); and

(2) whether it has plans to, after obtaining data confirming that traffic signal systems can effectively improve traffic flow and safety at roundabouts, conduct a comprehensive study on installing a real-time adaptive traffic signal system at every roundabout in Hong Kong, with a view to using artificial intelligence and big data to monitor traffic flow and adjust signals in real time; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Pok Oi Roundabout is a major hub in Yuen Long and a key route for vehicles travelling to and from Yuen Long Town in the Northwest New Territories. Heavy traffic flows are observed at Pok Oi Roundabout during morning and evening peak hours, resulting in increased travelling time. The Government has been monitoring the traffic situation there and has implemented several road improvement works in phases. After consulting the Transport Department (TD), my response to the question raised by the Hon Michael Tien is as follows:

(1) Traffic improvement measures at Pok Oi Roundabout in Yuen Long, which include the installation of traffic signal controls and the widening of the exit to Au Tau, were implemented on February 9, 2025. The traffic signal controls effectively balanced the flow of vehicles at various entrances of the roundabout, allowing vehicles to enter in an orderly manner. The widening of the exit to Au Tau provided additional road space, streamlining the traffic flow there. As the daily traffic pattern and variations at the Pok Oi Roundabout are relatively stable, the current traffic signal time plan set for different time periods has effectively streamlined the traffic flow, thereby significantly shortening the traffic queues and queuing time to enter the roundabout, and enhancing its operational efficiency. The traffic data before and after the implementation of the aforementioned traffic improvement measures is provided at Annex.

(2) Roundabout is a common design of road intersection in Hong Kong. In general, roundabouts can self-regulate the vehicular flow, enabling smooth passage of vehicles from various directions under varying traffic volumes. The TD continuously monitors the traffic conditions and implements feasible improvement measures as needed, such as adjusting traffic lane designs, optimising road markings and signage, to maintain smooth operation of roundabouts and ensure road safety.

Under certain traffic conditions—particularly when exceptionally heavy volumes enter the roundabout from one or more directions—the roundabout's self-regulating capacity may become overwhelmed. In these instances, installation of traffic signals at appropriate locations of roundabout can control the approaching traffic, allow vehicles from different directions to enter the roundabout in an orderly manner and enhance its operational efficiency (such as Pok Oi Roundabout in Yuen Long).

In addition to the traffic flow characteristics in roundabouts aforementioned, the TD takes into account a range of factors when considering the installation of traffic signals at a roundabout. These include the necessity for traffic signals, the size of roundabout, road layout, geographical constraints, and driver behavior.

Regarding the enquiry about installing a Real-time Adaptive Traffic Signal System (RTATSS) at roundabouts, RTATSS uses sensors placed at junctions and employs AI to analyse traffic patterns in real time—across various directions and time periods. It calculates and optimises the allocation of green time to improve flow for both vehicles and pedestrians, effectively balancing the needs of all road users. RTATSS implemented under pilot project undertaken by the TD are currently operating smoothly, with data showing an approximate 5 per cent to 10 per cent reduction in average delay for vehicles passing through the junctions, thereby enhancing the operational efficiency of junctions. The TD is planning to implement the RTATSS at approximately 50 suitable isolated signalised junctions across the territory with the first batch scheduled for commissioning in 2026. The TD is also arranging pilot installations at other linked signalised junctions with relatively heavy traffic flow to test relevant technologies from other places (including the Mainland). This will contribute to the formulation of plans for the wider adoption of RTATSS at other suitable junctions.

Regarding the installation of RTATSS at signalised roundabouts, the technical complexity is greater compared to conventional signalised junctions because the system has to simultaneously detect and process traffic circulating within the roundabout as well as traffic waiting to enter the roundabout from each approach lane. The TD will review the feasibility of extending RTATSS to signalised roundabouts after accumulating more experience from its application at conventional signalised junctions."
LCQ21: e-CNY wallets,2025-10-08 12:00,2025-10-08 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800250.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Holden Chow and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  Hong Kong has become the first pilot area outside the Mainland where e-CNY wallets have been made fully available for setting up and use by residents since May last year. According to a press release issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in May last year, Hong Kong users could top up their e-CNY wallets via the Faster Payment System (FPS) through 17 local retail banks, with support for cross-border payments in 26 Mainland pilot areas (including Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area). It is learnt that while e-CNY wallets have been in operation for a year or so, public concerns have persisted over e-CNY wallets' usage restrictions, application scenario coverage and cross-border efficiency. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the total number of e-CNY personal wallets set up by Hong Kong residents and their utilisation rate (i.e. at least one transaction per month) as at May this year; if it has not compiled such statistics, whether the HKMA will collect such data in the future; whether the progress of setting up e-CNY wallets in Hong Kong meets the authorities' expectations as compared with other Mainland pilot cities (e.g. Shenzhen or Shanghai);

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the current coverage rate of Hong Kong retail merchants accepting e-CNY payments, and the respective distribution of such merchants across the three regions, namely Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories; if it has not compiled such statistics, whether the HKMA will collect such data in the future; whether the HKMA has assessed the effectiveness of its specific measures to promote the acceptance of e-CNY wallets by local merchants for payment;

(3) as there are views that while the add value service via FPS offers convenience, the current limit per transaction and annual cumulative payment limit for e-CNY wallets are RMB 2,000 and RMB 50,000 respectively, whether the authorities have assessed if such arrangements are sufficient to meet Hong Kong people's cross-border consumption demand; whether the relevant limits will be relaxed specifically for business travellers or frequent users of e-CNY wallets;

(4) in the Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge project jointly conducted by the HKMA with other central banks, of the cumulative amount of cross-border trade settlement completed by Hong Kong enterprises using e-CNY and the reduction in handling fees; whether it knows the measures put in place by the HKMA to enhance enterprises' participation in the project; and

(5) whether it knows the HKMA's specific timetable for rolling out functional upgrade (e.g. introducing real-name authentication and increasing personal transfer limits) to e-CNY wallets and expanding the application scenarios (e.g. supply chain finance and cross-border payment of wages) for enterprises?

Reply:

President,

  The Government attaches great importance to promoting fintech development, and has been working closely with financial regulators as well as industry players to adopt multi-pronged measures for driving fintech forward.

  In May 2024, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) expanded the scope of e-CNY pilot in Hong Kong to facilitate the set-up and the use of e-CNY wallets by Hong Kong residents, as well as the top-up of e-CNY wallets via the Faster Payment System. The e-CNY provides an additional option of safe, convenient and innovative payment to residents of the two places, thereby enhancing efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payment services, as well as promoting interconnectivity of the two places.

  In consultation with the HKMA, our reply to the five parts of the question is as follows.

(1) and (2) The HKMA maintains close liaison with the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC, as well as the subsidiary banks of the Mainland operating institutions in Hong Kong, to understand the usage of e-CNY wallets and gauge user feedback. The HKMA also encourages banks to promote more local retail merchants to accept e-CNY. It is understood that the number of local retail merchants accepting e-CNY is gradually increasing.

  As the Mainland operating institutions are responsible for operating the e-CNY wallets and providing relevant services, the HKMA does not maintain statistics on the number of e-CNY wallets set up by Hong Kong residents and their utilisation rate, as well as the coverage rate of Hong Kong retail merchants accepting e-CNY payment.

(3) and (5) The HKMA will continue to work closely with the PBoC to facilitate the progress of e-CNY cross-boundary pilot in Hong Kong, including promoting more local retail merchants to accept e-CNY, and exploring more application scenarios, with a view to expanding the scope of e-CNY pilot.

  The PBoC and the HKMA are exploring the arrangements and feasibility of upgrading e-CNY wallets, with a view to increasing the usage limit of e-CNY wallets and supporting more application scenarios. As the discussion is still ongoing, the specific proposals and timetable are not finalised yet.

(4) In June 2024, the Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge) project reached the ""Minimum Viable Product"" (MVP) stage. The mBridge platform adopts permissioned distributed ledger technology developed specifically for the project, which enables local banks of both payers and recipients to conduct direct transaction settlement, thereby significantly reducing the cost of cross-boundary payment. Participating commercial banks in Hong Kong determine the service fees for cross-boundary payment via the mBridge platform having regard to their operating costs and commercial considerations.

  Project mBridge has become a part of Hong Kong's financial market infrastructure. As the project has entered the MVP stage, the mBridge project team will continue to optimise and enhance platform functions, including supporting the participating commercial banks to integrate with the application programming interface system of Project mBridge, with a view to improving transaction efficiency and enhancing the experience of corporate clients. In addition, Project mBridge will gradually expand the participation of public and private sectors, with a view to offering more efficient and convenient service options for cross-border payment."
立法會三題：修葺道路坑洞的工作,2025-10-08 12:00,2025-10-08 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800270.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上黃俊碩議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

本港於今年暑假期間發生連場暴雨，香港天文台更加破紀錄在不足三周時間內發出五次黑色暴雨警告信號。據悉在暴雨過後，有道路使用者投訴路面出現很多大小不一的坑洞，嚴重影響行車安全。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）就今年暑假期間所發出的五次黑色暴雨信號，路政署接獲多少宗有關大雨過後路面出現坑洞的報告或投訴，並按全港18區列出分項數字；

（二）當局收到第（一）項所述的報告或投訴後，負責道路維修的承建商完成修葺工作的最短、最長及平均天數為何；及

（三）鑑於有市民指出，一些已完成坑洞修葺工作的的道路很容易再被雨水沖毀，經修葺的部分經常再出現損毀，路政署有否備存相關道路的紀錄；過去三年，路政署有否就上述修葺坑洞工作的質量問題而向負責道路維修的承建商作出懲處，或責成有關承建商全面提升路面修葺和保養工作的質量；如有，詳請為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就黃議員提問的各部分，經諮詢路政署後，現回覆如下：

（一）香港天文台於今年七月二十九日至八月十四日期間共發出五次黑色暴雨警告信號。在七月二十九日至八月十五日期間，路政署接獲各區路面出現坑洞的報告或投訴個案數字見附件。

（二）路政署接獲有關公共道路損毀或欠妥的投訴或公眾報告後，會盡快派員到場視察，並根據實際情況適時安排合適的維修。一般而言，涉及路面坑洞的個案，路政署會立即安排承建商盡快維修。路政署在收到第（一）部分所述的報告或投訴後，有關修葺路面坑洞的工作均按部門服務承諾在48小時內完成，其中約九成個案更於數小時至24小時內完成。

（三）路政署及其承建商一般會記錄有關修葺路面坑洞的基本資料，包括所在的路段、坑洞的大小及完成修葺的時間等，惟並無特別就坑洞是否因原有鋪路物料出現破損或臨時修補物料脫落所致作統計。另外，由於道路設施的路面會因日常使用出現損耗，亦會因其他不能預見的情況，包括交通意外及惡劣天氣等而引致出現坑洞，因此導致路面重複出現損毀的因素不能一概而論，路政署並無備存坑洞經修葺後重複出現損毀的次數之相關資料。

路政署十分重視路面工程的質素，並設有嚴格的監管機制以確保道路維修工程的質素及耐用程度。如路政署發現承建商的工作欠妥，未能達到合約指定水平，會根據合約規定及既定機制作跟進，包括因應承建商未有準時及妥善完成道路維修保養工作並提交相關報告，向其發出關於欠妥事項的相應違約通知書、將審核巡查期間發現的不足之處記錄在審核巡查報告內，用以評估承建商的服務水平、根據發出違約通知書的情況及承建商的服務水平扣減合約款項，以及因應承建商整體表現欠佳，或其表現欠妥導致發生個別嚴重事故發出警告信等，並會在每月進度會議上責成承建商跟進及改善。路政署亦會將承建商的欠妥表現反映在其表現評核報告中，報告的評分會直接影響承建商日後投得新工務工程合約的機會，而報告若持續被評為不合格，承建商更有機會被暫停投標資格。路政署會繼續嚴格監察承建商的工作表現，確保承建商在進行例行檢查及詳細檢查時，按相關規定記錄所有損毀情況，並適時完成有關的維修工作，以確保道路的安全。

路政署曾於過去三年在發現道路維修工作欠妥時，根據相關合約條款作出適當的跟進（例如向表現不理想的承建商發出違約通知書）。然而，由於相關跟進工作涉及各種維修工作欠妥的情況，路政署並無特別就路面坑洞維修的質量問題的跟進工作分拆備存有關統計數據。

除在發現坑洞後為路面進行修復工作，並嚴格監督承建商的工程質素外，路政署一直密切監察較多出現損毀的路面，並會適時為這些路面及其他不會對道路安全構成即時危險的破損路面，在考慮不同因素後，制定合適的維修計劃和時間表，例如適時為其進行較全面及持久的重鋪工程，以防有關路段因各種不同情況（包括密集降雨等）而較易再次出現耗損。今年三月，路政署更成立由副署長領導的道路維修策略委員會，邀請相關部門的代表加入委員會就公共道路維修提供意見及協助，共同制定需進行大規模道路維修工程項目的清單、按每段路面的損毀程度和所需資源等因素排列工程項目的優先次序等，更有策略及有規劃地為本港道路安排適切的維修保養工作。

與此同時，路政署亦致力採用創新科技，以提升道路維修和保養工程服務的效率。透過採用人工智能偵測道路欠妥系統（註一）及激光掃描路面三維影像的路面狀況評估系統（註二）等協助偵測並整合道路的欠妥情況，以提升道路巡查的準確度及維修工作的效率，並幫助長遠維修保養工作的規劃。

此外，路政署積極研究更耐用的鋪路物料，以減慢道路損毀的速度乃至減低維修工作的頻率，同時減少對市民造成的不便。自今年四月一日起，路政署已全面採用高改性瀝青物料於合適位置作鋪路之用，以進一步提升本港整體路面質素。該物料在抗變形、抗老化及抗疲勞方面的表現均優於傳統瀝青，能有效提升道路的耐用性並減少維修次數。其中，「高改性瀝青多孔摩擦層」比傳統物料耐用之餘，同時仍能保留迅速排走路面雨水的功能，能減少路面因積水而導致出現坑洞的情況。

路政署會繼續積極推展上述工作，在嚴格監督承建商進行路面修復工作以外，主動透過採用創新科技及持續留意並探討引入合適的新路面物料等為本港路面進行預防性保養工作，減低日後可能因路面受損而對市民造成不便的機會。

註一：此系統已被納入為道路巡查的標準作業程序作恆常使用。

註二：有關的巡路檢測車正為全港的公共道路進行檢測。路政署將評估該系統的成本效益，並考慮在未來的維修合約中推行。"
LCQ3: Repair works for potholes on roads ,2025-10-08 12:00,2025-10-08 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800294.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Edmund Wong and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

Hong Kong has experienced consecutive rainstorms during the summer holidays this year, and the Hong Kong Observatory had even issued Black Rainstorm Signal on a record-breaking five occasions within less than three weeks. It is learnt that after the rainstorms, some road users have complained about the numerous potholes of different sizes on road surfaces, which seriously affected road safety. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) regarding the Black Rainstorm Signal issued on five occasions during the summer holidays this year, of the number of reports or complaints received by the Highways Department (HyD) concerning the occurrence of potholes on road surfaces after the rainstorms, with a breakdown by the 18 districts across the territory;

(2) upon receipt of the reports or complaints mentioned in (1) by the authorities, of the minimum, maximum and average number of days required by the contractors responsible for road maintenance to complete the repair works; and

(3) as some members of the public have pointed out that roads with repaired potholes were easily damaged again by rainwater, and the repaired sections are repeatedly sustaining damage, whether the HyD has kept records of the roads concerned; whether the HyD has imposed penalties on the contractors responsible for road maintenance due to quality problems of the aforesaid repair works for potholes over the past three years, or instructed the contractors concerned to comprehensively enhance the quality of repair and maintenance works of road surfaces; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Highways Department (HyD), my reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Edmund Wong is as follows:

(1) The Hong Kong Observatory issued a total of five Black Rainstorm Warning Signals between July 29 and August 14 this year. The number of reports or complaints regarding potholes received by the HyD between July 29 and August 15 is at Annex.

(2) Upon receiving complaints or reports from the public regarding damage or defects on public roads, the HyD will inspect the site as soon as possible and arrange appropriate repairs in a timely manner with regard to the actual situation. In general, the HyD will immediately arrange contractors to carry out repair works as quickly as possible for cases involving potholes. Upon receiving the reports or complaints as mentioned in part (1), the HyD has completed the relevant repair works for potholes within 48 hours in accordance with the department's performance pledge, while approximately 90 per cent of them were completed within a few hours to 24 hours.

(3) The HyD and its contractors generally record basic information on repairs of potholes, including the concerned road section, pothole size and completion time. However, the HyD does not specifically track whether the potholes are caused by deterioration of original paving material or detachment of temporary repair materials. Furthermore, road surfaces experience wear and tear from daily use and potholes may also emerge due to other unforeseen circumstances, including traffic accidents and inclement weather. Therefore, factors contributing to repeated damage of road surface cannot be generalised. The HyD does not maintain records on the frequency of repeated damage to potholes after repairs.

The HyD attaches great importance to the quality of road surfacing works and has a strict monitoring mechanism to ensure the quality and durability of road maintenance works. If the HyD identifies deficiencies in a contractor's work which fails to meet the contractual standards, it will follow up in accordance with the contractual provisions and established mechanism. This includes issuing corresponding Default Notices to the contractor for the defects if the contractor fails to complete road maintenance works and submit the relevant reports in time and properly, recording the deficiencies identified during audit inspections in audit inspection reports to assess the contractor's performance level, deducting contract payments based on the issuance of Default Notices and the contractor's performance level, as well as issuing warning letters to contractor due to overall poor performance or individual serious incidents resulting from inadequate performance. Contractors are also required to follow up and make improvements during monthly progress meetings. The HyD will also reflect contractor's inadequate performance in their performance evaluation reports. The ratings in these reports will directly affect contractor's future chances of winning new public works contracts. If the reports are consistently rated as unsatisfactory, the contractor may even be suspended from bidding. The HyD will continue to strictly monitor the contractors' performance to ensure that all damage is properly documented in accordance with relevant regulations during routine and detailed inspections, and relevant repair works are completed in a timely manner to ensure road safety.

Over the past three years, the HyD has taken appropriate follow-up actions in accordance with relevant contract terms whenever deficiencies in road maintenance works were identified (e.g. issuing Default Notices to contractors with unsatisfactory performance). However, as these follow-up works involve various types of maintenance deficiencies, the HyD does not maintain separate statistics specifically for the follow-up actions related to the quality of pothole repairs.

Apart from repairing road surfaces upon identifying potholes and strictly supervising the quality of contractors' work, the HyD has been closely monitoring road surfaces which are prone to damage. Taking into account various factors, the HyD will formulate appropriate maintenance plans and schedules for theses sections and other damaged road surfaces which do not pose an immediate threat to road safety. For example, more comprehensive and durable resurfacing works may be carried out when appropriate to prevent accelerated deterioration due to various conditions (including intensive rainfall). In March this year, the HyD established the Strategic Road Maintenance Committee led by the Deputy Director of Highways. Representatives from relevant departments were invited to join the Committee to advise and assist in the maintenance of public roads. The Committee will jointly compile a list of roads that require large-scale maintenance, and prioritise maintenance works based on various factors such as the extent of damage to each section of the road and the resources required for the repair works. This allows the Committee to arrange appropriate maintenance works for the roads in Hong Kong in a more strategic and organised manner.

At the same time, the HyD is also committed to adopting innovative technologies to enhance the efficiency of road repair and maintenance services. By utilising artificial intelligence in the Road Defect Detection System (Note 1) and laser scanning for three-dimensional imaging in Road Condition Assessment System (Note 2) to assist in the detection and integration of the road defects information, the accuracy of road inspections and efficiency of repair works can be improved while facilitating long-term planning of maintenance works.

In addition, the HyD is actively researching more durable paving materials to slow down the rate of road deterioration and reduce the frequency of maintenance work to minimise inconvenience to the public. Since April 1 this year, the HyD has fully adopted highly modified bituminous paving materials for paving at suitable locations to further improve the overall quality of road pavements in Hong Kong. This material has better anti-deformation, anti-aging and anti-fatigue performance than conventional bitumen, and can effectively enhance the durability of roads and reduce the maintenance frequency. Among them, the ""Highly Modified Friction Course"" is more durable than conventional materials while still retaining its ability to rapidly discharge rainwater from the road surface, thereby minimising the occurrence of potholes on road surface due to water accumulation.

The HyD will continue to actively implement the abovementioned initiatives. In addition to strictly supervising contractors in carrying out road repair work, it will proactively implement preventive maintenance for Hong Kong's road surfaces by adopting innovative technologies and continuously monitoring and exploring the introduction of suitable new road pavement materials, so as to minimise inconveniences to the public caused by road surface damage in the future.

Note 1: This system has been incorporated into the standard operating procedures for road inspections for regular use.

Note 2: The relevant road inspection vehicles are currently conducting inspections on public roads throughout Hong Kong. The HyD will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the system and consider implementing it in future maintenance contracts."
Labour Department suspends recognition of safety training courses operated by two training course providers,2025-10-08 12:00,2025-10-08 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800258.htm,"The Labour Department (LD) today (October 8) suspended the recognition of the Mandatory Basic Safety Training Course (Construction Work) (commonly known as the Green Card Course) organised by the Neighbourhood & Worker's Service Centre (NWSC) and the Hong Kong Federation of Women's Centres Limited (HKFOWCL) for a period of six months, until April 7, 2026.
â
The LD found that the NWSC had violated the approval conditions for operating the course, including disclosing all examination questions and relevant answer choices to trainees before the examination by a trainer, and allowing a trainee who did not fulfil the required attendance to attend the examination. After conducting thorough investigations and gathering evidence, and taking into account the explanations and representations provided by the NWSC and the trainer involved, the LD decided to suspend its recognition for six months in view of the serious nature of the violation. The trainer involved was also removed from delivering the respective course at the NWSC. All trainees involved will not be issued green cards.

The LD also found that the HKFOWCL had violated the approval conditions for operating the course, including failing to ensure that invigilators were present in examination rooms during the course examinations. Furthermore, the trainer involved did not invigilate the examination in a proper manner, resulting in the failure to detect trainees discussing answers with each other during the examination. After conducting thorough investigations and gathering evidence, and taking into account the explanations and representations provided by the HKFOWCL and the trainer involved, the LD decided to suspend its recognition for six months in view of the serious nature of the violation. The trainer involved will also be suspended from delivering the respective course for a period of six months at the HKFOWCL. The green cards of all trainees involved in cheating were recalled and cancelled.

A spokesman for the LD said, ""The LD is highly concerned about the quality of mandatory safety training courses. In response to the recommendations in the report released by the Office of The Ombudsman on its direct investigation into the 'Government's Regulation of Occupational Safety and Health in the Construction Industry', the LD has increased manpower since April this year to monitor compliance with approval conditions by recognised training course providers to maintain the standard of the training courses and ensure that workers receive appropriate occupational safety and health (OSH) training. If a training course provider does not comply with the approval conditions set by the LD, its recognition to operate the relevant courses will be withdrawn or suspended. The LD will continue to closely monitor the quality of all training course providers and their trainers and strive to enhance the standard of OSH in Hong Kong.""

After imposing the above sanctions, there are 132 training course providers offering the recognised Green Card Course. Relevant course information has been uploaded to the LD's website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/osh/content5.htm) for public reference. Individuals interested in enrolling in the relevant course may contact these training course providers.

立法會二十一題：數字人民幣錢包,2025-10-08 12:00,2025-10-08 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800247.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上周浩鼎議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

香港自去年五月成為內地以外首個全面開放居民開立和使用數字人民幣錢包（數幣錢包）的試點地區。而根據香港金融管理局（金管局）在去年五月發出的新聞稿，香港用戶可透過17間本地零售銀行經「轉數快」為數幣錢包增值，並支援在內地26個試點地區（包括粵港澳大灣區內地城市）進行跨境支付。據悉數幣錢包雖已推行一年多，但公眾對數幣錢包的使用限制、應用場景覆蓋及跨境效率仍存有疑慮。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計，截至本年五月，香港居民已開立的個人數幣錢包總數及使用率（即每月有進行至少一次的交易）分別為何；如沒有統計，金管局未來會否收集有關數據；與內地其他試點城市（例如深圳或上海）相比，本港數幣錢包的開立進度是否符合當局預期；

（二）有否統計，現時香港零售商戶接受數字人民幣支付的覆蓋率，以及相關商戶在香港島、九龍及新界三個區域的分布分別為何；如沒有統計，金管局未來會否收集有關數據；金管局有否評估其推動本地商戶接受數幣錢包進行支付的具體措施的成效為何；

（三）鑑於有意見認為，轉數快的增值服務雖然便利，但現行數幣錢包的單筆支付金額限額及年累計支付金額限額分別為2,000元和5萬元人民幣，當局有否評估相關安排是否足以滿足香港市民的跨境消費需求；會否針對商務旅客或數幣錢包的高頻使用者放寬相關限額；

（四）在金管局與其他中央銀行共同開發的「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」項目中，香港企業透過數字人民幣完成跨境貿易結算的累計金額及手續費降幅分別為何；是否知悉，金管局有何措施提升企業在該項目的參與度；及

（五）是否知悉，金管局就數幣錢包的功能升級（例如推出實名認證和提高個人轉帳金額）及拓展企業應用場景（例如供應鏈金融和跨境薪資發放）的具體時間表為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府十分重視金融科技發展，一直與金融監管機構及行業持份者緊密合作，採取多管齊下措施推動金融科技向前邁進。

二○二四年五月，中國人民銀行（人民銀行）與香港金融管理局（金管局）擴大數字人民幣在香港的跨境試點，便利香港居民開立和使用數字人民幣錢包（數幣錢包），並透過「轉數快」為數幣錢包增值。數字人民幣為兩地居民提供多一個安全、便捷及嶄新的支付選擇，提升跨境支付服務效率和用戶體驗，促進兩地互聯互通。

就問題的五個部分，經諮詢金管局後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（二）金管局一直與人民銀行數字貨幣研究所，以及內地運營機構於香港的子銀行保持緊密溝通，了解數幣錢包的使用情況及用戶反饋，並鼓勵銀行推動更多本地零售商戶接受數字人民幣。據了解，接受數字人民幣的本地零售點正逐步增加。

由於內地運營機構負責營運數幣錢包及提供有關服務，金管局沒有香港居民已開立的數幣錢包總數及使用率，以及香港零售商戶接受數字人民幣支付覆蓋率的統計數字。

（三）及（五）金管局會繼續配合人民銀行推動數字人民幣在香港的跨境試點進程，包括促進更多本地零售商戶接受數字人民幣，以及探索更多應用場景，以擴大數字人民幣的試點覆蓋範圍。

人民銀行及金管局正探討數幣錢包升級的安排及可行性，以提高數幣錢包的使用額度，以及支援更多應用場景。由於相關討論仍在進行中，具體方案及時間表有待落實。

（四）二○二四年六月，「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」（mBridge）項目進入「最簡可行產品」階段。mBridge平台採用專門為該項目開發的許可制分布式分類帳技術，使付款人和收款人的本地銀行可以直接進行交易結算，從而大大降低跨境支付成本。香港參與的商業銀行會根據其營運成本及商業考量，釐定透過mBridge平台提供的跨境支付服務手續費。

mBridge項目已成為香港金融市場基建的一部分。隨着項目進入「最簡可行產品」階段，mBridge項目團隊將持續優化和增強平台功能，包括支援參與商業銀行與mBridge的應用程式介面系統對接，以提升交易效率，以及改善企業客戶的體驗。此外，mBridge項目將逐步擴大公營和私營機構的參與，為跨境支付提供更高效及更便捷的服務選項。"

答覆：

主席：

元朗博愛迴旋處是新界西北車輛進出元朗市的要道，也是元朗區內的樞紐，於早上和傍晚上下班的時間較為繁忙，令行車時間增加。政府一直關注該地點的交通情況，並已逐步落實多項道路改善工程。就田北辰議員的提問，經諮詢運輸署後，我現回覆如下：

（一）在元朗博愛迴旋處加設交通燈及擴闊凹頭方向出口的改善措施已於二○二五年二月九日啓用。設置交通燈有效平衡迴旋處各入口的車流，令車輛有序地進入，而擴闊後的凹頭出口可提供額外路面空間，讓該位置的車流更加暢順。博愛迴旋處每天的車流特性及變化相對穩定，現時在不同時段設定的交通燈號時間已有效疏導車流，大幅縮短等候進入迴旋處的車龍和所需時間，提升迴旋處的運作效率。上述交通改善措施實施前後的交通數據載於附件。

（二）迴旋處是香港常見的路口設計。一般而言，迴旋處具備自我調節車輛通過的能力，能在不同的車流量下有效地讓來往各個方向的車輛順利通過路口。運輸署持續留意迴旋處的交通情況，並根據實際需要適時採取可行的交通改善措施，包括調整行車線設計、優化道路標記及道路標誌等，以維持迴旋處的運作暢順和確保行車安全。

在特定的交通情況下，例如當迴旋處一個或多個方向進入的車流量特別大，影響迴旋處自我調節車輛通過的功能時，在迴旋處合適位置裝設交通燈可調控相關方向進入迴旋處的車流，從而讓各個方向的車輛有序地進入迴旋處，提升迴旋處的運作效率（例如元朗博愛迴旋處）。

運輸署在迴旋處加設交通燈時除考慮上述的迴旋處車流特性外，也會一併考慮一籃子因素，包括加設交通燈的需要、迴旋處大小、道路設置、地理限制及駕駛者習慣等。

至於有關研究在迴旋處加設實時交通燈號調節系統的提問，實時交通燈號調節系統透過在路口加設感應器，以人工智能實時分析不同時段及方向的人流和車流，並進行運算，從而更有效地分配車輛及行人的綠燈時間，平衡不同道路使用者的需要。現時，運輸署的有關先導計劃運作暢順，數據顯示車輛通過路口的平均時間減少約5%至10%，路口的運作效率得以提高。運輸署正逐步把實時交通燈號調節系統推展至全港約50個合適的獨立燈控路口，首批會於二○二六年啓用，並正安排在其他交通流量較高的聯動式路口試點安裝，藉此引入和測試其他地區（包括內地）的相關技術，以協助制定把系統推展至其他合適路口的計劃。

至於在交通燈控制的迴旋處加設實時交通燈號調節系統，由於系統需要同時偵測及處理正在迴旋處內行駛，以及在迴旋處外準備駛入各行車道的車流狀況，技術上較一般交通燈控路口更為複雜，運輸署正累積更多於一般路口應用實時交通燈號調節系統的經驗，以期檢視將系統推展到燈控迴旋處的可行性。"
立法會二十二題：政府財產的管理,2025-10-08 11:45,2025-10-08 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800210.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上林筱魯議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

答覆：

主席：

就問題的各部分，經諮詢財政司司長辦公室，現回覆如下。

（一）根據《財政司司長法團條例》（第1015章），財政司司長法團（法團）是由當時執行財政司司長職務的人成立的單一法團。法團可代表政府持有和管理政府資產，政府會按需要透過該法團直接或間接持有負責特定項目的公司，以提供公共服務或實踐重要的政策目標，例如香港數碼港管理有限公司、香港鐵路有限公司、香港科技園公司、機場管理局、香港投資管理有限公司、香港國際主題樂園有限公司等。

（二）這些企業可以按市場原則運作，透過引入商業模式的管理架構和專才，以靈活和市場化的營運和財務安排運作。除協助政府達致政策目標，亦可鼓勵創新和提高生產力，以提升服務質素和效率；亦可推動相關業界的發展，優化本港的產業結構。

這些企業在日常運作方面有相當大的自主權，但負責相關政策的政策局或部門會透過不同方式監督它們的發展方向和運作，以保障公眾利益以及政府作為股東的權益，主要措施包括：

（i）委派相關政策局和／或部門的人員擔任企業的董事會成員監察企業表現、參與重大決策的討論，並就營運方針、企業計劃和財務預測等提供意見，確保企業的運作符合相關政策目標和妥善運用資金，以保障政府的股東權益和公帑的運用。政府代表亦會在董事會就與公眾相關的議題提供意見，確保企業的運作能顧及公眾利益；

（ii）設立監察機制，包括由政府司局長檢視及批核企業的年度計劃和財務預算、制定主要績效指標、規定這些企業定期向政府提交報告等。個別企業亦受專屬法例規管（如機場管理局和香港科技園公司等），當中清楚訂明有關監察制度；以及

（iii）這些企業須定期向立法會匯報其財政狀況、工作進度等。

（三）二○二五年《施政報告》宣布成立由行政長官擔任主席的「北部都會區發展委員會」，下設三個工作組。其中，由財政司司長任組長的「發展及營運模式設計組」（設計組）會按北部都會區（北都）各指定發展區的性質和規模，設計發展及營運模式，包括為不同產業園區度身成立園區公司、法定或非法定專門機構，制定公私營合作模式、為區內產業用地和主要發展項目制定合適的批撥土地方案，以及相應的融資安排。設計組於二○二五年九月二十九日已召開首次會議。

設計組會參考以往參與重要發展項目所採用的模式，秉持開放、靈活及創新的思維，研究最切合北都各個發展區和園區的發展方案，在制度上拆牆鬆綁，並善用市場力量，以多元化方式，加快北都發展和產業進駐。"
LCQ22: Management of Government property,2025-10-08 11:45,2025-10-08 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800214.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Andrew Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

 The Financial Secretary Incorporated (FSI) may hold and manage Government property, and for certain large development projects involving the Government such as the Cyberport, the Government will also set up companies owned by FSI to deal with the projects. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the projects FSI is currently engaged in or managing, directly and indirectly, and the companies or bodies owned by FSI (set out in a table);

(2) for the projects in which FSI is directly or indirectly engaged as mentioned in (1), of the government departments responsible for the actual monitoring of such projects, and the management frameworks or mechanisms respectively; and

(3) given that the 2025 Policy Address proposes to set up a Working Group on Devising Development and Operation Models, to be led by the Financial Secretary, under the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis to formulate development and operation models for industry parks in the Northern Metropolis, taking into account their nature and scale, whether the Government will draw on the models and mechanisms previously employed in projects in which FSI was directly or indirectly engaged, or introduce other new models in taking forward and running the projects of various industry parks; if so, of the details?

Reply:

President,

 In consultation with the Financial Secretary's Office, my reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) Under the Financial Secretary Incorporation Ordinance (Cap. 1015), Financial Secretary Incorporated (FSI) is a corporation sole constituted by the person who for the time being is performing the duties of the office of Financial Secretary. The FSI may hold and manage government assets on behalf of the Government, and the Government would, as required, through the FSI, directly or indirectly hold companies specifically established for individual projects, with a view to providing public services or achieving important policy objectives. Examples include Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, MTR Corporation Limited, Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, Airport Authority, Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, Hongkong International Theme Parks Limited, etc.

(2) These enterprises can operate in accordance with market principles, which allows them to bring in the management and expertise from the commercial sector and adopt more flexible and market-oriented financial and operational arrangements. Apart from helping the Government to achieve policy objectives, this arrangement can also encourage innovation and enhance productivity, improve service quality and efficiency, and promote the development of relevant industries, thereby facilitating structural upgrades of Hong Kong's industries.

 These enterprises have considerable autonomy in their day-to-day operations. Nevertheless, government bureaux or departments in charge of relevant policies oversee their development direction and operations through various means to safeguard public interests and the Government's interests as a shareholder. These measures mainly include:

(i) appointing officers from relevant bureaux and/or departments to serve as board members of these enterprises to monitor their performance, participate in discussions on major decisions, and provide advice on their operational strategies, corporate plans and financial projections, with a view to ensuring that the enterprises' operations align with relevant policy objectives and that resources are properly utilised, thereby safeguarding the Government's interest as a shareholder and the use of public money. Government representatives also provide input at board meetings on issues relevant to the public to ensure that enterprises would give due regard to public interest in their operations;

(ii) establishing monitoring mechanisms, including having Secretaries of Departments and Directors of Bureaux review and approve enterprises' annual plans and financial budgets, setting key performance indicators, and requiring these enterprises to submit regular reports to the Government. Individual enterprises are also regulated by specific legislation (such as the Airport Authority and Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, etc.) which clearly stipulates the relevant monitoring mechanisms; and

(iii) requesting these enterprises to regularly report to the Legislative Council on their financial position, work progress, etc.

(3) The 2025 Policy Address announced the establishment of the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis chaired by the Chief Executive, under which three working groups have been set up. Among them, the Working Group on Devising Development and Operation Models (the Working Group) led by the Financial Secretary will formulate development and operation models for designated development areas in the Northern Metropolis (NM), taking into account their nature and scale. This will include setting up dedicated companies, or statutory or non-statutory bodies, for various industrial parks, devising public-private partnership approaches, considering appropriate land disposal approaches for industry land and major development projects in the NM, as well as the suitable financing arrangements. The Working Group held its first meeting on September 29, 2025.

 The Working Group will make reference to the models previously adopted in participating in major development projects, and adopt an open-minded, flexible and innovative approach in considering the development strategies that best suit the characteristics of various development areas and industry parks of the NM. It will endeavour to remove unnecessary barriers and ease restrictions and leverage market capital with a view to accelerating the development of NM and anchoring of industries through a diversified approach."

"LCSD's ""Cheers!"" Series to present family entertainment programmes from November to February next year (with photos)",2025-10-08 11:30,2025-10-08 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100200663.htm,"  The annual ""Cheers!"" Series, presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, will be held from November to February next year. Offering a variety of family entertainment programmes ranging from puppetry, acrobatics, circus, dance, music and theatre to multimedia shows and musicals, the series will showcase fabulous performances by nine visiting and local performing groups that will delight audiences during the festive season.

  This edition of the series will feature five international award-winning productions and four local programmes. Starting the series in mid-November is the puppetry musical ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" (dubbed in Cantonese) by the Theater Company Hikosen from Japan. With delicate masks, beautiful costumes and ingenious stage props, the troupe will bring this beloved fairy tale to life, allowing children to join Jack on a fantastical adventure in climbing the beanstalk grown from magical beans and venturing into the giant's lair to rescue Princess Mary. This programme is also part of the third Asia+ Festival.

  Circus and acrobatic performances have always been popular among young audiences and their families. Two performers from the Australian ARC Circus Dance Theatre will present the Asian premiere of the physical theatre production ""A Bee Story"" in early December. This comedic show blends elements of circus, acrobatics, music and dance to tell the story of Queen Bee and Worker Bee, who work together to rebuild their hive after it is destroyed by a bushfire, conveying a message on environmental conservation. The Japanese contemporary circus company, Cirquework, will perform ""YOAH"" in late January next year. The story follows a girl who overcomes the magic of evil wizards and finds her way home with the moon's guidance. A team of young acrobatic artists will skilfully integrate music, stage lighting and visual effects to redefine the concept of a circus, enabling audiences to enjoy a unique and captivating journey.

  Many family-friendly puppet theatre works have incorporated multimedia elements to unleash imaginations and creativity in recent years. Xirriquiteula Teatre from Spain will present ""Laika"" in mid-January next year, employing shadow play, puppets, physical theatre, installations and film montage to tell the story of how Laika the stray puppy becomes the first space explorer to take on a thrilling adventure into the universe. The narrative encourages audiences to reflect on the human drive towards progress and the true meaning of life. A multimedia theatre show, ""The Storyville Mosquito"", will be staged in the opening season of the East Kowloon Cultural Centre in February next year. Canada's Kid Koala will film a real-time movie about a jazz-loving mosquito's musical adventure in the city in one take by using exquisite miniature puppets, sets and props alongside a live original music score, offering audiences a multifaceted experience combining cinema, theatre and a concert setting.

  The above programmes will be accompanied by various extension activities such as meet-the-artist sessions, backstage tours or workshops. For details, please visit www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/Programme/en/f_entertainment/groups_1883.html.

  Local art groups will also present a rich line-up of performances, including the Hong Kong Oratorio Society's concert ""The Messiah"" to commemorate the 340th anniversary of Handel, the Master of Oratorios; the multimedia children's puppet theatre ""One Lap - 16000km: The Little Penguin's Way Home"" by puppet theatre troupe Make Friends With Puppet; the non-verbal full mask theatre ""Plastic Island"" by Free-To-Play; and the tap theatre ""The Making of the Perfect Mulan"" by the professional tap dance company R&T (Rhythm & Tempo) with child performers. Details of these programmes will be announced on the above-mentioned website in due course.

立法會十七題：僱員被拖欠工資的情況,2025-10-08 11:15,2025-10-08 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800249.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上陸頌雄議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見指出本港經濟發展面臨諸多挑戰，當中建造業、飲食業及零售業接連有企業倒閉，欠薪問題頻發，令工人權益受損。根據《僱傭條例》（第57章），僱主在工資期屆滿後七天內仍未支付工資給僱員即可被檢控，一經定罪最高可被判罰款35萬元及監禁三年。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年勞工處接獲僱員被欠薪的個案宗數，以及每宗個案平均每人被欠薪的金額分別為何，並按行業列出分項數字；

（二）過去三年，每年勞工處就有關拖欠工資作出檢控（包括被判罰款、監禁或社會服務令）的個案宗數為何；被判罰款的個案中，每宗個案平均被判罰款的金額為何；

（三）就欠薪個案，勞工處有何準則決定是否向相關人士提出刑事檢控；

（四）有否檢視現時有關欠薪的罰則是否具備足夠的阻嚇力；當局有何措施進一步加強監察和規管，以杜絕發生僱員被欠薪，以及破產欠薪保障基金被濫用的情況；及

（五）有何措施進一步加強宣傳教育，以提醒僱主切勿拖欠工資，避免以身試法？

答覆：

主席：

勞工處採取多管齊下的策略，包括積極跟進舉報個案、搜集情報、主動巡查、深入調查及檢控，致力打擊欠薪罪行。除嚴厲執法外，勞工處亦經不同渠道提醒僱主必須履行支付工資的法定責任；以及鼓勵僱員應及早追討欠薪，保障自身的權益。

就議員的提問，現答覆如下︰

（一）二○二二年至二○二四年，勞工處處理因工資爭議而發生的個案按行業劃分的數字見附件一。勞工處沒有備存每宗個案平均每名僱員被欠薪金額的數字。

（二）二○二二年至二○二四年，勞工處每年就涉嫌違反《僱傭條例》有關支付工資規定的僱主，提出檢控並完成聆訊的傳票數目、被定罪的傳票數目及每年被定罪傳票平均罰款的數字載於附件二。

（三）勞工處處理涉嫌欠薪的個案時，如發現僱主可能涉及違反《僱傭條例》的罪行，會邀請有關僱員提供進一步資料；當有表面證據顯示僱主涉嫌違例，會邀請僱員出任控方證人，指證涉嫌違例的僱主。勞工處根據律政司發布的《檢控守則》審視是否有足夠證據證明相關僱主故意及無合理辯解違反《僱傭條例》有關支付工資的規定。如有足夠證據，勞工處會提出檢控。

（四）勞工處勞資關係科與工作夥伴及相關持份者保持緊密聯繫，並從不同渠道收集及評估有關欠薪的情報。如獲悉個別僱主有欠薪情況，勞工處會主動接觸有關企業的負責人，提醒及要求他們必須根據《僱傭條例》及僱傭合約支付僱員的工資；並持續監察支薪情況。

根據《僱傭條例》，僱主如故意及無合理辯解而不依時向僱員支付工資，最高可被罰款35萬元及監禁三年。如該罪行是在法團的董事、經理、秘書或其他類似人員的同意或縱容或疏忽下所犯，則該人即屬犯了相同罪行，可被判相同的刑罰。經多年來的嚴厲執法，僱主普遍明白拖欠工資的嚴重後果。

為防止濫用破產欠薪保障基金（破欠基金），政府已成立跨部門專責小組，成員包括勞工處、警務處商業罪案調查科及破產管理署的代表，加強主動偵查可疑個案。勞工處嚴謹審批及緊密跟進每宗破欠基金申請。如發現公司負責人涉嫌非法轉移資產、盜竊公款、藉欺騙手段逃避債務、沒有妥善備存公司帳目等，勞工處會將案件轉交警務處及／或破產管理署跟進。另外，如發現任何人士就破欠基金申請虛報資料，勞工處會採取執法行動。

（五）勞工處經不同途徑進行廣泛宣傳，包括播放電視宣傳短片及電台宣傳聲帶、於報章及主要商會刊物刊登廣告、舉辦展覽、張貼海報及派發單張等，提醒僱主履行支付工資的法定責任。勞工處亦設立並廣泛宣傳投訴熱線（28152200），呼籲及便利僱員舉報欠薪個案。"
LCQ17: Default on payment of wages to employees,2025-10-08 11:15,2025-10-08 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800251.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Luk Chung-hung and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

 There are views pointing out that the economic development of Hong Kong faces many challenges, including a series of business closures and frequent wage default problems in the construction, catering and retail industries which impair workers' rights. Under the Employment Ordinance (Cap. 57), employers who fail to pay wages to employees within seven days after the expiry of the wage period is liable on conviction to a maximum penalty of a fine of $350,000 and imprisonment for three years. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of cases of default on payment of wages to employees received by the Labour Department (LD) in each of the past three years, as well as the average amount of wages in arrears per person in each case, together with a breakdown by industry;

(2) of the number of cases in which the LD initiated prosecutions against wage default cases in each of the past three years (including the cases in which fines, imprisonment or community service orders were imposed); among the cases with fines imposed, the average amount of fine in each case;

(3) regarding wage default cases, of the criteria adopted by the LD for determining whether criminal prosecution against the relevant parties will be initiated;

(4) whether it has reviewed if the current penalties for wage defaults have sufficient deterrent effect; of the measures put in place by the authorities to further strengthen monitoring and regulation to eradicate defaults on payment of wages to employees and abuses of the Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund; and

(5) of the measures in place to further strengthen publicity and education efforts to remind employers not to default on payment of wages and risk violating the law?

Reply:

President,

 The Labour Department (LD) is committed to combating wage offences through multi-pronged strategies, including proactive follow-up of reported cases, intelligence gathering, proactive inspections, in-depth investigations and prosecutions. In addition to stringent law enforcement, the LD reminds employers through various channels of their statutory obligation to pay wages, and encouraging employees to promptly pursue outstanding wages to protect their rights and interests.

 In response to the Member's question, the reply is provided below:

(1) From 2022 to 2024, the number of cases caused by wage disputes and handled by the LD with a breakdown by industry is at Annex 1. The LD does not keep the figures on the average amount of wages in arrears per employee in each case.

(2) From 2022 to 2024, the number of summonses heard in respect of wage offences under the Employment Ordinance (EO) prosecuted by the LD each year, the number of summonses convicted and the average fine for summonses convicted each year are at Annex 2.

(3) While handling cases with suspected wages in arrears, the LD will invite the employees to provide further information if it is discovered that the employers may have violated the EO. If there is prima facie evidence of contravening the EO, the employees will be invited to act as prosecution witnesses to testify against the employers who are suspected to have contravened the law. In accordance with the Prosecution Code promulgated by the Department of Justice, the LD will assess whether there is sufficient evidence to prove that an employer has wilfully and without reasonable excuse contravened the wage payment requirements under the EO. If there is sufficient evidence, the LD will initiate prosecution.

(4) The Labour Relations Division of the LD has been maintaining close liaison with working partners and relevant stakeholders, gathering and assessing the intelligence from different sources on wage defaults. If the LD is aware of an individual employer with wage default, the LD will proactively reach out to the persons-in-charge of the concerned establishment, remind and urge them for settlement of employees' wages in accordance with the EO and the terms of employment contracts; and keep track of the status of wage payment.

 According to the EO, an employer who wilfully and without reasonable excuse fails to pay wages to an employee when it becomes due is subject to a fine up to $350,000 and imprisonment for three years. If the default of wages is committed with the consent, connivance of, or negligence of body corporate's director, manager, secretary or other similar officer, then such person shall also be guilty of the like offence and is liable to the same penalty. Upon stringent enforcement of the law over the years, employers are generally cognisant of the serious consequences of wage defaults.

 To prevent the abuse of the Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund (PWIF), the Government has set up an inter-departmental task force comprising representatives from the LD, the Commercial Crime Bureau of the Hong Kong Police Force (the Police) and the Official Receiver's Office (ORO) to strengthen proactive investigation of suspicious cases. The LD rigorously verifies and closely monitors every application to the PWIF. If the company responsible persons are suspected of illegal transfer of assets, theft of company money, evasion of liabilities by deception, failure to keep proper accounting records, etc., the LD will refer such cases to the Police and/or ORO for follow-up. Besides, if any person is found to have provided false information in respect of a PWIF application, the LD would take enforcement action.

(5) The LD will continue to conduct extensive publicity, including broadcasting television and radio announcements in the public interest, placing advertisements in newspapers and publications of major employer associations, organising exhibitions, displaying posters and distributing leaflets, to remind employers to fulfil their statutory obligations to pay wages. The LD has also set up and widely publicised a complaint hotline (28152200) to encourage and facilitate employees to report wage default cases."
LCQ5: Neighbourhood Support Child Care Project,2025-10-08 11:10,2025-10-08 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800243.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Tang Ka-piu and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

 The Government announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the service places under the Neighbourhood Support Child Care Project (the Care Project) would be increased to 2500, providing flexible child care services for families in need. However, an incident took place last year in the Tuen Mun District involving a suspected case of abuse leading to serious injuries of an infant under the care of a home-based child carer (HCC), arousing public concern about the service quality of HCC. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the Government has increased the incentive payment for HCCs since April last year and increased the service places for HCCs in the fourth quarter of last year, of the specific measures and mechanisms put in place by the Government to enhance and ensure the quality of HCCs, particularly whether additional training has been provided for HCCs who need to take care of young children under the age of three, ethnic minority children or children with disabilities; if so, of the details;

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the current number of HCCs, their academic qualifications or professional qualifications, with a tabulated breakdown by age group (each group covering 10 years of age);

(3) whether it has compiled statistics on the current number of persons who work as HCCs and take care of their own children at the same time, as well as the number of surveillance cameras installed in their homes, and set out the breakdown in a table;

(4) whether it has established a regular mechanism to access HCC services to ensure their service quality; if so, of the relevant assessment indicators;

(5) of the respective numbers of children currently using the relevant services under the Care Project and HCCs in various districts;

(6) it has been reported that the aforesaid child abuse incident took place more than 18 months ago, yet its investigation remains inconclusive, of the latest progress of the investigation into the incident; whether the Social Welfare Department has conducted an investigation into the organisation providing the relevant HCC services after the incident; if so, of the investigation results; if not, the reasons for that;

(7) as there are views that despite the dedicated efforts of healthcare personnel to treat the child injured in the aforesaid child abuse incident, the child's development is likely to be affected in the long run because of serious injuries, how the Government will provide appropriate support and assistance to the child in areas such as rehabilitation, welfare and education; and

(8) in response to the aforesaid child abuse incident, whether the Government has proposed any targeted improvement measures to enhance the service quality of the Care Project; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

(1), (4) and (8) The Social Welfare Department (SWD) provides subventions to non-governmental organisations for operating the Neighbourhood Support Child Care Project (NSCCP), which provides flexible day child care service at the neighbourhood level for parents with service needs.

 To ensure service quality and protect children who receive services, the SWD requires service operators to establish mechanisms to recruit, assess, screen and train up home-based child carers (HCCs), and match suitable HCCs for families in need. Social workers of service operators are required to conduct regular home visits to HCCs who provide services. Child care workers of service operators also provide HCCs with monthly individual training/supervision. In addition, service operators are also required to continuously evaluate and follow up on the performance of HCCs.

 From September 2024 onwards, all HCCs participating in NSCCP are required to receive 14 hours of basic training, the content of which is standardised and formulated by the SWD. The training includes infant and child (i.e. children aged below three) physical and psychological development, special development milestones and needs of growth, care and communication skills, home safety and hygiene as well as handling of accidents/special incidents, and basic knowledge related to ethnic minority children would be provided during service matching. HCCs who are arranged to take care of children with special needs (including children with special learning needs) are required to receive additional four hours of advanced training to acquire relevant knowledge and skills. As HCCs would not be arranged to take care of children with disabilities, the relevant training does not include knowledge on taking care of children with disabilities. After the completion of the training programme, service operators are required to evaluate the child care skills and knowledge of HCCs, their confidence in providing care services, and their home environment. HCCs would only be arranged to provide services if all of their aforementioned aspects are considered as satisfactory and service-ready.

(2) The number of HCCs of NSCCP as at June 2025 are tabulated by age group and educational attainment as follows:

Table 1: Age Group

(3) The SWD does not maintain information on whether HCCs take care of their own children at the same time or whether they have installed surveillance cameras in their homes.

(5) The number of HCCs as at June 2025 and the number of children received services under NSCCP in 2024-25, by District Council districts, are set out at Annex.

(6) and (7) Relevant professionals, through multi-disciplinary collaboration, have been providing the child and her family with necessary assistance, which include arranging medical consultation, treatment and rehabilitation services for the child concerned, as well as counseling, financial assistance, and other support services for her family according to the care requirements of the child. The service operator concerned has submitted a report to the SWD regarding the incident, confirming that the HCC had undergone and passed the assessment of NSCCP before providing services to the child. As the Police is still investigating the case, it is not appropriate to comment on the details of the case at this stage. We will continue to provide appropriate assistance based on the needs of the child and her family."
立法會五題：鄰里支援幼兒照顧計劃,2025-10-08 11:10,2025-10-08 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800238.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上鄧家彪議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

政府於二○二四年《施政報告》宣布將鄰里支援幼兒照顧計劃（照顧計劃）的服務名額增加至2 500個，為有需要的家庭提供具彈性的幼兒照顧服務。然而，去年屯門區曾發生一宗涉及由社區保姆照顧的嬰兒懷疑受虐而引致嚴重受傷的事件，令社會關注社區保姆的服務質素。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府自去年四月起，增加社區保姆的服務獎勵金，亦在去年第四季增加社區保姆的服務名額，政府有何具體措施與機制提升及確保社區保姆的質素，尤其是有否為需要照顧三歲以下的幼童、少數族裔兒童或殘疾兒童的社區保姆提供額外培訓；如有，詳情為何；

（二）有否統計，現時社區保姆的數目、學歷或專業資格分別為何，並按年齡組別（以每10歲為一組）以表列出分項數字；

（三）有否統計，現時擔任社區保姆的人士同時也有照顧其子女的人數，以及其家中有安裝監察鏡頭的數目分別為何，並以表列出分項數字；

（四）有否設立恆常機制評估社區保姆的服務，以確保其服務質素；如有，相關評估指標為何；

（五）現時照顧計劃下各區使用相關服務的兒童及社區保姆人數分別為何；

（六）據報上述虐兒事件已發生超過18個月，但其調查仍未有結論，該事件的最新調查進展為何；社會福利署有否在該事件發生後對提供相關社區保姆服務的機構進行調查；如有，調查結果為何；如否，原因為何；

（七）鑑於有意見認為，儘管醫療人員已盡心盡力治療在上述虐兒事件中受傷的兒童，但由於該兒童已嚴重受傷，其發展極有可能長遠受影響，政府會如何在復康、福利、教育等範疇向該兒童提供適切的支援與協助；及

（八）因應上述虐兒事件，政府有否提出任何具針對性的改善措施，以提升照顧計劃的服務質素；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

（一）、（四）及（八）社會福利署（社署）津助非政府機構營辦鄰里支援幼兒照顧計劃（照顧計劃），為有服務需要的家長在鄰里層面提供彈性的日間幼兒照顧服務。

為確保服務質素及保護接受服務的兒童，社署要求服務營辦機構必須設有招募、評估、篩選及培訓社區保姆的機制，並為有需要的家庭配對合適的保姆。營辦機構的社工須定期向提供服務的社區保姆進行家訪，而機構的幼兒工作員亦會每月為社區保姆提供個別培訓／督導。此外，營辦機構亦須持續評估及跟進社區保姆的表現。

自二○二四年九月起，所有參與照顧計劃的社區保姆必須接受14小時的基礎訓練，內容由社署統一制定，包括嬰幼兒（即三歲以下的幼童）生理和心理發展、成長的特別發展里程和需要、照顧和溝通技巧、家居安全和衞生、意外和特別事故的處理等，以及在配對服務時提供與少數族裔兒童相關的基礎知識。獲安排照顧有特殊需要兒童（包括特殊學習需要兒童）的社區保姆須接受額外四小時的進階培訓，學習有關知識和技巧。由於照顧計劃不會安排社區保姆照顧殘疾兒童，相關培訓不包括照顧殘疾兒童的知識。完成培訓後，營辦機構須評估社區保姆的幼兒照顧技巧和知識、提供照顧服務的信心，以及家居環境，如果認為在上述各方面均適合提供照顧服務，才會安排社區保姆提供服務。

（二）截至二○二五年六月，照顧計劃的社區保姆數目按年齡組別及教育程度分別表列如下：

表一：年齡組別

（三）社署沒有備存社區保姆有否同時照顧其子女或家中有否安裝監察鏡頭的資料。

（五）截至二○二五年六月，照顧計劃按區議會分區的社區保姆數目及二○二四至二五年度使用服務的兒童人數載於附件。

（六）及（七）相關專業人員一直以多專業合作模式為該兒童及其家庭提供所需協助，包括安排涉事兒童接受醫療診治及康復服務，以及就其照顧需要向其家庭提供輔導、經濟援助和其他支援服務。有關營辦機構已就事件向社署提交報告，確認該社區保姆為涉事兒童提供服務前已接受並通過照顧計劃的評估。由於警方目前仍在調查該宗案件，現階段不宜評論案件詳情。我們會繼續按該兒童及其家庭的需要提供適切協助。"
​立法會十一題：涉及聘用專業人員的政府外判服務,2025-10-08 11:05,2025-10-08 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800237.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上林新強議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

本會於二○二三年十一月十五日通過「政府帶頭檢討外判制度」的議員議案，要求政府帶頭檢討改革外判制度，包括優先外判給聘用本地專業人士的本地企業，以讓本地僱員都能獲得工作經驗及提升競爭力。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年政府的專業職系（例如律師、會計師及工程師等）的職位空缺數目為何；有否檢視哪些專業職系是長期欠缺人手；

（二）過去三年，政府透過外判服務合約或由外判機構所聘用的本地專業人員數目為何（按專業列出），以及當中涉及的金額為何；及

（三）政府就涉及聘用專業人員或提供專業服務的外判服務投標書的評審標準為何，例如會否要求由本地專業人員提供服務？

答覆：

主席：

就林新強議員的提問，本局諮詢公務員事務局、發展局、律政司及法律援助署（法援署）後，現回覆如下：

（一）公務員事務局表示，過去三個財政年度（即二○二二／二三至二○二四／二五年度），政府34個專業職系的職位空缺總數分別為672、755及720個，分別佔整體專業職系職位約百分之六點七、百分之七點四及百分之七點零，較同期公務員整體空缺率為低。當中以工程師、醫生、牙科醫生及政府律師職系相對有較多空缺。

政府部門一向有機制處理出缺職位的工作，以盡量減低對部門工作或公共服務的影響。相關措施包括透過招聘、晉升，或由合適的人員署任，如有需要亦可考慮延長屆退休年齡公務員的服務或聘用非公務員合約僱員等。部門亦會透過重訂工作優次、重組工作、善用科技及精簡程序，從而優化公務員人力資源的運用，持續提升政府效率和服務。

（二）及（三）若政府部門以外判方式應付其服務或人力需求，一般會透過公開公平的方式採購服務，並按各自需要，制訂其招標規格和採購合約的要求，包括要求相關人員符合相關的本地專業資格或相關要求。

由於政府部門的外判服務合約均有機會涉及聘用專業人員，而外判服務由部門直接進行採購，財經事務及庫務局並沒有備存有關合約的詳細資料。由於政府的專業人員職系眾多，因應議員問題第（一）部分就法律、工程和會計服務專業人員的關注，以下回覆將聚焦相關外判服務合約。

就法律服務而言，律政司和法援署會因應其需要委託外判大律師／律師處理檢控、民事和法律援助案件。在委託大律師／律師處理案件時，部門一般會考慮案件的性質和複雜程度、大律師／律師的資歷和專長等因素。除了律政司和法援署外，其他部門亦可能會因應個別需要而外判法律服務。

律政司過去三個財政年度僱用外判法律服務及有關的專業人員的費用表列如下：

雖然法援署沒有就本地及非本地大律師／律師數目作分項統計，惟獲委派法律援助案件的絕大部分為本地律師。

在工務工程方面，相關部門會按工程項目需要委聘顧問公司提供專業人員以執行有關工程規劃、研究及設計的工作，以及在工程建造階段提供駐工地人員負責工程合約的管理及監督工作。發展局及相關部門過去三個財政年度的顧問合約聘用專業人員數目和費用的估算資料表列如下：

雖然發展局及相關部門並沒有就上述專業人員的本地及非本地人員數目作分項統計，顧問公司聘用的專業人員及駐工地專業人員絕大部分為本地專業人員。

為確保承接政府合約的顧問公司具質素和能力，發展局制定了認可顧問公司名單，供符合准入條件（包括聘用專業人員數目要求）的本地及非本地顧問公司申請加入。一般而言，專業人員必須持有相關香港法定專業學會所認可的本地或非本地專業資格；但准入條件並沒有規範顧問公司必須聘用本地專業人員。在評審顧問合約標書的經驗要求時，採購部門亦會考慮顧問公司及其提供的專業人員在本地及非本地的相關經驗。

在會計服務方面，政府部門透過外判服務合約聘用的服務包括為部門推行的項目提供顧問服務和運作支援服務等，部分服務或會涉及聘用會計師。由於部門因應運作需要自行聘用上述服務，財經事務及庫務局並沒有備存相關服務涉及本地會計師數目和所涉及金額的相關資料。"
LCQ11: Government outsourced services involving employment of professionals,2025-10-08 11:05,2025-10-08 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800239.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Lam San-keung and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  This Council passed the motion on ""Taking the lead by the Government to review the outsourcing system"" at its meeting on November 15, 2023, urging the Government to take the lead to review and reform the outsourcing system, including giving priority to local enterprises which employ local professionals when outsourcing, so that local employees can gain work experience and enhance their competitiveness. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of vacancies in government professional grades (e.g. lawyers, accountants and engineers) in each of the past three years; whether it has reviewed which professional grades are facing chronic manpower shortages;

(2) of the number of local professionals employed by the Government through outsourced service contracts or by outsourcing organisations in the past three years (set out by profession), and the amounts of money involved; and

(3) of the criteria adopted by the Government for evaluating tenders for outsourced services involving the employment of professionals or the provision of professional services, such as whether it will require the services to be provided by local professionals?

Reply:

President,

  Having consulted the Civil Service Bureau (CSB), the Development Bureau (DEVB), the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Legal Aid Department (LAD), our reply to the question raised by the Hon Lam San-keung is as follows:

(1) According to CSB, in the past three financial years (i.e. 2022-23 to 2024-25), the total number of vacancies among the 34 professional grades in the Government was 672, 755 and 720 respectively, accounting for approximately 6.7 per cent, 7.4 per cent, and 7.0 per cent of the total positions of the professional grades. Such vacancy rates were lower than the overall vacancy rates of the civil service in the same period. Among them, vacancies were relatively higher in the grades of Engineer, Medical and Health Officer, Dental Officer and Government Counsel.

  Government departments have all along put in place mechanisms to handle the duties of vacant posts to minimise disruption to departmental operations or public services. Relevant measures include recruitment, promotion or appointment of suitable officers to take up acting appointments. Where necessary, consideration may also be given to extending the service of civil servants beyond the retirement age, employing non-civil service contract staff, etc. Departments would also re-prioritise and re-organise their work, capitalise on technology solutions, and streamline work processes, with a view to optimising the use of the civil service manpower resources and enhancing efficiency and service delivery of the Government continuously.

(2) and (3) Government departments which address their service or manpower needs through outsourcing generally procure services in an open and fair manner, and draw up tender specifications and requirements of procurement contracts in accordance with their respective needs, including setting requirements for the relevant personnel to meet applicable local professional qualifications or pertinent requirements.

  As outsourced service contracts in government departments may involve the engagement of professionals and such outsourced services are directly procured by the departments, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) does not maintain any details of the relevant contracts. Considering the diverse range of professional grades in the Government, the following reply specifically addresses outsourced service contracts related to legal, engineering and accounting professionals in response to the Hon Member's concern raised in part (1) of the question.

  As regards legal services, DoJ and LAD engage outsourced counsel/solicitors based on their needs to handle prosecution, civil and legal aid cases. When engaging counsel/solicitors to handle cases, departments generally take into account various factors such as the nature and complexity of the cases, qualifications and expertise of the counsel/solicitors, etc. Besides DoJ and LAD, other departments may also outsource legal services having regard to their individual needs.

  DoJ's expenses for engaging outsourced legal services and related professionals in the past three financial years are tabulated as follows:




Financial year
Expenses for engaging legal services and related professionals
			($ million) (approximate)
Estimated percentage of expenses attributed to local personnel/entities (Note1)


2022-23
190
97.8%


2023-24
199
97.5%


2024-25
180
98.6%



Note 1: ""Local personnel/entities"" mainly refers to local lawyers or law firms, and includes professionals such as arbitrators or related firms/companies.

  The numbers of counsel and solicitors to whom LAD assigned legal aid cases and the relevant expenses in the past three financial years are tabulated as follows:




Financial year
Number of counsel
Number of solicitors
Expenses associated with counsel and solicitors ($million) (approximate) (Note2)


2022-23
474
961
1,025


2023-24
460
903
953


2024-25
496
922
930



Note 2: The figures refer to the actual amount paid in the respective financial year, which may include expenses for services rendered in previous financial year(s).

  Although LAD does not maintain a breakdown of statistics by the number of local and non-local counsel/solicitors, the vast majority of those who were assigned legal aid cases were local lawyers.

  In terms of public works, relevant departments engage consultants to provide professionals for undertaking the work on project planning, investigation and design, and to arrange resident site staff for contract management and site supervision during the construction stage, having regard to the needs of works projects. As for the number of professionals engaged under consultancy agreements by DEVB and relevant departments as well as the expenses, estimations for the past three financial years are tabulated as follows:




Professionals engaged under architectural and
			engineering-associated consultancy agreements (Note 3)

2024-25

1,868



Note 4: The above professional resident site staff include engineers, architects, surveyors and landscape architects.

  Although DEVB and relevant departments do not maintain a breakdown of statistics by local and non-local personnel for the above professionals, the vast majority of professionals and resident site staff engaged by consultants are local professionals.

  To ensure the quality and capability of consultants undertaking government contracts, DEVB has drawn up lists of approved consultants which allow local and non-local consultants fulfilling the admission requirements (including the requirement on the number of professionals engaged) to apply for inclusion. In general, professionals must hold local or non-local professional qualifications recognised by relevant statutory professional institutes in Hong Kong. However, it is not compulsory for consultants to engage local professionals under the admission requirements. Moreover, when evaluating experience requirements in proposals for consultancy agreements, procuring departments will consider relevant local and non-local experience of the consultants and their professionals.

  As for accounting services, the services procured by government departments through outsourced service contracts include the provision of consultancy services and operational support services for their initiatives, etc., some of which may involve the employment of accountants. As departments procure the above services based on their operational needs, FSTB does not maintain relevant statistics on the number of local accountants engaged for the related services and the expenses involved."

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-10-08 06:46,2025-10-08 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800123.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 8) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-07 17:35,2025-10-07 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/07/P2025100700483.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 7), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 27 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 3 181 new CF cases in Guangdong in the past week (September 28 to October 4), which is more or less the same level as the previous week's 3 153 cases (September 21 to 27). The majority of cases (2 480 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. While the recent upward trend of CF cases in Jiangmen has been preliminarily contained, the number of cases still fluctuates at a relatively high level.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
