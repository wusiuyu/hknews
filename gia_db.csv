教育局局長在立法會教育事務委員會會議就《行政長官2025年施政報告》有關教育措施的開場發言（只有中文）,2025-10-03 15:56,2025-10-03 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300588.htm,"以下是教育局局長蔡若蓮博士今日（十月三日）在立法會教育事務委員會會議上，就《行政長官2025年施政報告》有關教育措施的開場發言：

主席︰

國家《教育強國建設規劃綱要（2024-2035年）》（《規劃綱要》），提出強化教育對科技和人才的支撐作用，配合國家二○三五年建成教育強國的目標和「科教興國」戰略，我們把握機遇，積極發展香港成為國際教育樞紐、國際高端人才集聚高地，推動育才、匯才、科技協同發展，並推動數字教育，以塑造發展新優勢。

目前，香港是全球唯一擁有五間百強大學的城市，我們有四所大學位列全球最國際化大學前十名，另外有六個學科打入全球十大。這結果肯定了香港教育的質素與實力，亦突顯「一國兩制」之下的獨特優勢。未來，特區政府將會加快推進國際教育樞紐建設，新措施包括成立「留學香港專班」，與相關政策部門及機構加強聯動，推出「Hong Kong: Your World-class Campus」大型宣傳計劃，制定宣傳策略，組織高校併船出海，推廣「留學香港」品牌，吸引海內外一流教研人才和學生來港升學和進行科研；推出高增值「遊學香港」活動，吸引非本地高中生來港體驗，增加對香港高等教育的認知與認同；另外，教資會（大學教育資助委員會）亦會撥款4,000萬元資助八所資助大學加大國際和內地宣傳。

同時，有見非本地生申請人數持續上升，本地院校循序漸進以超額形式吸納非本地生自費入讀，我們將調整資助專上院校非本地生學額上限，由目前百分之四十增至百分之五十；資助研究院研究課程的超額收生自資學額上限，亦由百分之一百增至百分之一百二十，支持專上院校從長遠規劃，擴大規模，提升質素，強化國際化與多元化的校園環境，貢獻香港國際專上教育樞紐建設。值得注意的是，增加非本地學生限額，不會減少現時每年15 000個本地學生資助學額。各大學以謹慎務實的態度，考慮配套條件及確保教育質素情況下，以超額形式取錄非本地學生，並收取至少足以收回所有額外直接成本的學費，確保公帑運用得宜。

北都（北部都會區）大學城發展，為專上教育界別提供額外土地，創造空間，讓香港院校拓展學術及研究的國際化和多元化發展。配合政府成立「北都發展委員會」和「大學城籌劃及建設組」，教育局會積極參與其中，加快北都大學城發展步伐。

宿舍配套方面，為應對非本地學生人數上升，除了宿舍發展基金資助大學增建宿舍外，我們會結合市場力量，加快學生宿舍供應，措施包括擴展「城中學舍計劃」的便利措施，由涵蓋商廈改裝擴展至拆卸原有商廈後重建的全新學生宿舍，並在今年內預留全新商業或其他土地興建新宿舍。

在擴展職專（職業專才）教育方面，教育局鼓勵應用科學大學與內地和海外龍頭企業加強合作，支持產教融合和聯動推廣。香港應用科學大學聯盟會研究推進與廣東省頂尖職業技術院校合作，共建粵港澳大灣區交流平台。我們亦會繼續與內地積極探討落實香港和內地互認副學位程度學歷，幫助兩地職專畢業生跨境求職或升學。

除專上教育外，教育局亦支持中小學教育參與國際教育樞紐建設。現階段，我們將以試點形式，容許直資學校申請上調班級數目及每班學生人數，錄取持學生簽證的非本地學生。另外，香港中學文憑考試（文憑試）獲得全球院校的廣泛認可，我們會繼續透過不同渠道，向海內外推介，進一步提升文憑試在國際上的認受性，為考生開拓更多升學選擇。教育局亦會加大力度打擊違規提供文憑試課程或「借殼辦學」的做法，包括已與內地教育部門組成聯合專班，從源頭打擊違規辦學，並已設立舉報機制、進行突擊巡查，和進一步明確明年文憑試自修生報考安排，嚴打「假學生」、「假身分」。同時，教育局會於二○二五年年底前制定《私立學校實務守則》以提升提供正規課程私立學校的辦學水平，並設立「私校名冊」，公布合規私校名單。

發展國際學校方面，政府支持國際學校體系的蓬勃發展，以滿足非本地家庭對國際學校學額的需求，吸引和挽留非本地人才。因應包括來港人才的非本地家庭對國際學校需求的短期波動，教育局已透過校舍分配工作分配兩所空置校舍，增加約1 000個學額。而為應付長遠需求，教育局已在北部都會區預留土地發展國際學校。為更好滿足非本地學生的不同需要，我們鼓勵國際學校提高收生名額，並會拆牆鬆綁，容許優質國際學校以自資模式在校舍用地增建學生宿舍、教學空間及優化設施。

因應人工智能（AI）時代的來臨，配合國家「科教興國」大方向及《規劃綱要》提出的國家教育數字化戰略，我們會繼續積極推動數字教育，包括在優質教育基金預留20億元，推進中小學數字教育相關支援措施；在二○二六年發表《中小學數字教育藍圖》，通過優化中小學銜接的資訊和創新科技教育課程、訂定「人工智能素養」學習架構、將AI教育納入核心課程。同時加強教師AI培訓、引入企業資源等。我們亦會啓動檢視高中數理科目的課程設置，培育更多修讀科學及數學的學生，為創科發展提供人才支撐。

「立德樹人」是教育的根本任務，我們將由二○二五／二六學年起，把「心繫家國」系列活動恆常化和普及化，加強跨校、跨界別的協作，在認知、情感、實踐三個層面，深化愛國主義教育，幫助學生厚植家國情懷；並通過優化高中中史和歷史課程框架，在內地交流及考察活動增加建國歷史體驗行程，以及於二○二五／二六學年公布《價值觀教育課程架構》定稿等措施，優化教學。

教育局非常重視學生的身心健康，持續透過跨部門及跨界別合作，從多方面促進學生的精神健康。由二○二五／二六學年起，政府會恆常化在中學實施三層應急機制，並擴展到小學四至六年級試行，以協助中小學及早識別和加強支援有需要的學生。我們亦會繼續在校園大力推廣《4Rs精神健康約章》，鼓勵更多學校人員接受有關精神健康急救的培訓，以及推展家長教育，共同守護學童健康成長。

教師是立教之本，興教之源。政府致力提升教師的專業質素，加強教師的專業操守，因應社會對教師專業的要求日益提高，我們會研究修訂《教育條例》，引入執業證書和定期更新要求，完善教師註冊機制，以確保所有於香港學校任教的教師均為適合及適當人選，維護教師團隊的專業質素和形象。

「百年大計，教育為本」，教育是人才培育的關鍵，而人才是強國建設和民族復興的基礎。我們會繼續與不同持份者保持緊密聯繫及溝通，匯聚各方力量，推動香港教育更高質量發展，並朝着建成教育強國戰略目標扎實邁進。

主席，我簡介完畢。歡迎各位議員的提問，多謝。"
Keynote speech by SFST at Redefining Hong Kong: Next Generation Wealth (English only) (with photos),2025-10-03 15:54,2025-10-03 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300573.htm,"  Following is the keynote speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at Redefining Hong Kong: Next Generation Wealth today (October 3):

Catherine (Chief Executive Officer of South China Morning Post (SCMP), Ms Catherine So), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 It is my great pleasure to join you all today. Themed around ""Guiding Leadership, Innovation, and Legacy"", today's event gathers family office leaders, next-gen successors, and wealth management professionals to explore together the future of family offices.

Hong Kong's strengths

 Amid the current complex global landscape, Hong Kong stands out as a stable and strategic hub under the ""one country, two systems"" framework. It benefits from the strong support of the Chinese Mainland while maintaining global connectivity, making it ideal for enterprises to establish or expand their presence. Hong Kong acts as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"", serving as a springboard for Mainland companies to go global and attracting overseas firms. This unique positioning is reflected in top international rankings, where Hong Kong ranked as the world's freest economy and among the top three most competitive economies. Hong Kong also continues to rank third globally and first in the Asia-Pacific region in the latest Global Financial Centres Index released just last week.

 As a leading asset and wealth management centre, Hong Kong's assets under management reached HK$35.1 trillion as of end-2024, with an 81 per cent surge in fund inflows amounting to HK$705 billion. Within this industry, the family office sector is a vital pillar. Hong Kong's private banking and private wealth management business attributed to family offices and private trusts clients reached over HK$1,550 billion, underscoring Hong Kong's appeal among ultra-high-net-worth individuals and reinforcing its status as a global family office hub.

Government's initiatives on family offices

 To anchor Hong Kong's position as the nexus where family legacies and family office expertise converge, the Government has strategically prioritised the development of the family office sector. We have been pressing ahead at full steam to create a conducive environment for family offices, including introducing a preferential tax regime for single family offices, establishing the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy (HKAWL), and introducing and enhancing the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme.

 Our efforts have already borne fruit. Our city counted more than 2 700 single family offices, and the recent growth has been remarkable: Invest Hong Kong has successfully supported over 200 family offices in establishing or expanding their operations here, surpassing the target of attracting no less than 200 family offices by end-2025, as outlined in the 2022 Policy Address. As announced in the Policy Address last month, we target to attract an additional 220 family offices to Hong Kong from the year of 2026 to the year of 2028, bringing in an increasing volume of capital, talent, and business opportunities.

 The sector's dynamism is exemplified by the success of the flagship Wealth for Good in Hong Kong (WGHK) Summit, held annually since 2023, highlighting the city's commitment to developing its asset and wealth management ecosystem and solidifying the city's family office industry. Looking ahead, we will sustain robust investment promotion efforts and deepen collaboration with key stakeholders.

Trends in family office sector

 The global family office landscape is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by next-generation leadership transitions, growing interest in philanthropy and impact investing, emerging investment themes such as digital assets, and leveraging insurance as a tool for strategic capital management.

 So in my coming speech, I will highlight these areas, in particular how we can help and facilitate the growth of family wealth in these areas.

Next-generation leadership transitions

 Family offices are increasingly focused on smooth succession planning as leadership transitions to the next generation. In recent years, it is observed that emphasis is placed on the engagement of younger family members, like all of you, to ensure continuity of family values, vision, and also wealth preservation across generations.

 Next generation wealth is defined as the transfer and stewardship of assets, financial resources, knowledge, and values from one generation to the next within a family. It encompasses not only the inheritance of tangible assets such as cash, investments, real estate, and businesses, but also the intangible assets like financial literacy, family values, entrepreneurial skills, and social capital that are crucial for preserving and growing wealth across generations. This concept is more than just inheritance; it involves long-term planning, education, governance, and the creation of systems to sustain wealth beyond the original generation. Preparing the next generation involves imparting financial knowledge, fostering responsible management skills, and engaging heirs early to build confidence and establish a lasting legacy.

 In this regard, the HKAWL continues to focus on deepening the engagement with next generation wealth owners by curating training and development resources. The HKAWL just celebrated its two-year anniversary last month. Over the last two years, the HKAWL organised two Legacy Summits, which brought global speakers including leaders of prominent family foundations, such as the Rockefeller Foundation, and venture capital firms, to engage with global family principals and next-gens on discussions around philanthropy, impact investing, family governance and wealth management, fostering interaction and exchange within the industry, and facilitating families in creating impact and long-lasting legacies.

Growing interest in philanthropy and impact investing

 Many asset owners are looking to incorporate philanthropic initiatives into the overall wealth management framework for social betterment. In light of this, we announced the launch of the Impact Link (iLink) initiative in 2024. The iLink, administered by the HKAWL, connects philanthropists with each other and with impactful charity projects, builds a strong community around peers, and offers learning-by-doing opportunities through tangible projects.

 In June this year, the iLink Online Portal was launched, bringing together Strategic Partners with some 50 family partners, offering a dedicated platform for invited family philanthropists to discover scalable initiatives that address critical challenges in Hong Kong and beyond.

 On capacity building, the HKAWL organised various events and activities under the iLink, engaging global philanthropic foundations such as the Gates Foundation, Yidan Prize Foundation and Fondation de France Asia. These events provided family philanthropists with additional perspectives on deploying philanthropic capital and opportunities to explore collaborative and strategic approaches to philanthropy and impact.

 There is also an increasing interest in sustainable investments, which offer attractive risk-adjusted returns amid market uncertainties. The global impact investing market, valued at an estimated US$1.57 trillion, reflects a growing recognition of the need to address critical challenges such as climate change, poverty and inequality. This evolution in capital flows and sectoral allocation reflects a global investment trend with broader commitment to resilience and long-term value creation.

 Hong Kong, as Asia's leading international financial centre and sustainable finance hub, stands to contribute much in this aspect. Our capital market offers a wide range of green and sustainable investment products with over 200 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) funds authorised by the SFC (Securities and Futures Commission) with assets under management of over HK$1.1 trillion. The number of ESG funds and assets under management recorded an increase of 51 per cent and 18 per cent respectively from three years ago.

 In 2024, the total green and sustainable debt (including bonds and loans) issued in Hong Kong exceeded US$84 billion, representing a growth of around 50 per cent compared with 2021. Among them, the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong amounted to around US$43 billion, capturing around 45 per cent of the regional total and ranking first in the Asian market for seven consecutive years since 2018.

 We also see the importance of building up market infrastructure to connect capital with climate-related products and opportunities in Hong Kong, the Mainland, Asia and beyond. In 2022, Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited launched Core Climate, an international carbon marketplace to facilitate effective and transparent trading of carbon credits and instruments and to support the global transition to Net Zero.

Emerging investment themes: digital assets

 Investment diversification is increasingly embracing non-traditional asset classes such as digital assets. Digital assets attract interest from family offices due to their innovation potential and portfolio diversification benefits, supported by growing regulatory clarity globally. A recent industry survey showed that over 70 per cent of family office professionals have either invested in cryptocurrencies or are exploring the possibility. With its unique strengths, Hong Kong is well positioned to bridge traditional finance with the digital asset era.

 In June this year, we issued the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong, setting out a vision for a trusted and innovative digital asset ecosystem that prioritises risk management and investor protection, while delivering concrete benefits to the real economy and financial markets. One of the key focuses of the Policy Statement 2.0 is enhancing the legal and regulatory framework that provides a solid foundation for the sustainable development of the digital asset sector.

 The digital asset market is developing and evolving rapidly. Guided by the principle of ""same activity, same risks, same regulation"" under a risk-based approach, the Government will continue to enhance and establish a regulatory framework that reflects local circumstances and aligns with international standards and practices.

 To ensure that family offices benefit from these developments in digital assets and sustainable investments, which I just mentioned, we propose including carbon credits and digital assets, among others, as qualifying assets eligible for tax concessions for funds and single family offices. Our target is to introduce the bill into the Legislative Council in the first half of 2026. If approved, the relevant measures will take effect from the current year of assessment (2025/26).

Insurance as tool for strategic capital management

 For the next-generation stewards of wealth in this room, Hong Kong's insurance sector is a critical tool for strategic capital management. It has evolved far beyond basic protection into a sophisticated ecosystem for wealth preservation and risk mitigation.

 The primary connection lies in comprehensive risk mitigation. The concentration of wealth in a family office creates a concentration of risk. These are not simple risks; they are complex, cross-border, and often unique to your family's profile. They encompass everything from directors' liability and cyberattacks targeting your family's digital footprint to the physical protection of a globally dispersed art collection, real estate portfolio, or fleet of private assets. Hong Kong's insurers specialise in crafting bespoke, flexible policies for these complex exposures. They act as a critical buffer, transferring major risks away from your core capital and protecting the family's balance sheet from unforeseen events that could otherwise erode wealth built over generations.

 Furthermore, insurance is a powerful tool for legacy and succession planning. While Hong Kong does not have an estate duty, the challenge of transitioning control and assets seamlessly across generations remains. Life insurance products, when structured within a robust financial plan, provide immediate liquidity and can be instrumental in facilitating the smooth transfer of ownership and assets. They can help equalise inheritances among heirs without forcing the liquidation of a prized family business or other illiquid, emotional assets. This ensures that the family's vision and values are preserved, and that transition happens according to plan, not by force of circumstance.

 Hong Kong's role as the gateway to the Greater Bay Area and the Mainland adds a layer of strategic necessity. As your family's investments and interests grow within this dynamic region, understanding and mitigating local risks becomes paramount. Hong Kong's insurers possess the deep regional expertise and innovative capacity to structure solutions that protect these assets and facilitate secure investment.

 In essence, for a modern family office, partnering with Hong Kong's insurance sector is about building a resilient framework. It is a strategic alliance that empowers you to de-risk your portfolio, optimise your capital, secure your legacy, and protect your family's well-being, allowing you to focus on what matters most: growing and stewarding your wealth for the future.

Closing

 With our multipronged approach and the concerted efforts of the Government, regulators and the industry, I am confident that Hong Kong will continue to flourish as a leading family office hub in the region. I look forward to joining hands with each of you in shaping a better future for the family office sector.

 Last but not least, may I thank the SCMP again for the invitation to this gathering of bright minds. I wish you all a rewarding day of discussions. Thank you."

"Basic Housing Units Ordinance to come into effect on March 1, 2026",2025-10-03 12:30,2025-10-03 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100200765.htm,"  The Government today (October 3) published the Basic Housing Units Ordinance in the Gazette. The Ordinance will come into effect on March 1, 2026, except for the provisions concerning the offence of illegal letting of subdivided units (SDU), which will come into effect on March 1, 2027.

The Ordinance seeks to introduce, starting from March 1, 2026, a regulatory regime for the letting of SDUs in residential buildings (i.e. the regulatory regime on Basic Housing Units (BHU), under which SDUs in residential buildings have to comply with a set of minimum standards of living conditions (including minimum area, minimum height, fire safety, structural safety, separate toilet, water supply requirements, lighting and ventilation, as well as separate water and electricity meters) and obtain BHU recognition before they can be legally let out for habitation. This aims to ensure the provision of safe, hygienic and reasonable living conditions in SDUs.

The BHU regulatory regime will provide a 48-month transitional arrangement to allow time for SDU owners/operators to understand the new regulatory regime and gradually adapt to the BHU-related requirements. To this end, the Government will, on the effective date of the Ordinance, launch a 12-month registration system (i.e. until February 28, 2027) for existing SDUs to make registration and then obtain a 36-month grace period that runs after the expiry of the registration period (i.e. from March 1, 2027, to February 28, 2030) to enable necessary alteration works to be carried out and applications for BHU recognition to be made. The registration eligibility is pegged to the date of publication of the Ordinance in the Gazette today (gazettal date). In this connection, if the residential flat with SDUs has at least one valid domestic tenancy of an SDU on the gazettal date (i.e. October 3, 2025) or during the three-month period ending on the gazettal date, that SDU and other SDUs in the same residential flat will be regarded as ""pre-existing SDUs"" and may be registered as mentioned above to obtain the grace period. To encourage SDU owners/operators to submit registration and recognition applications as early as possible, the Government will provide ""early-bird"" reductions/waivers on recognition fees, i.e. application fees will be fully waived for SDUs with early registration/application (note).

Under the BHU regulatory regime, an SDU refers to the situation where a residential flat in domestic buildings or the domestic portion of composite buildings, through partition/repartition, has changed its layout compared to the one shown in the reference building plan and resulted in two or more compartments designed for separate domestic tenancies. In other words, if an individual residential flat has not been altered compared to the reference building plan, letting out the rooms in that residential flat for habitation will not fall within the scope of the regulation of the Ordinance. Moreover, in respect of private residential flats, the ""reference building plan"" generally refers to the relevant approved building plan for the issuance of the Occupation Permit (OP) by the Buildings Department (BD); and if the relevant residential flat has any building works certified as completed by BD to change the layout of the flat after obtaining the OP and before the gazettal date, the relevant approved building plan will be regarded as the ""reference building plan"", whichever is later.

Given that there are currently about 110 000 SDUs in residential buildings in Hong Kong, involving about 220 000 residents, the Government will adopt a pragmatic and people-oriented approach and take into account the future supply of BHUs and public housing, when taking orderly enforcement actions against the illegal letting of unregistered and unrecognised SDUs after the expiry of the registration period (i.e. starting from March 1, 2027). With the implementation of the BHU regulatory regime, the government understands that some SDU households may be affected by the need for relevant owners/operators to arrange alteration works for obtaining BHU recognition, or by the future enforcement actions to be carried out by the Government, rendering them unable to identify other suitable accommodation within a short period of time. If the households concerned are eligible to apply for Light Public Housing or transitional housing (TH), the projects that are currently in operation and coming on stream can provide them with sufficient accommodation options. The government also understands that some households may not fulfil the relevant application requirements, e.g. income/asset exceeding the limits. In this connection, the Government has announced earlier that a new type of Category C tenants for TH will be created starting from today, to provide temporary accommodation to those who are affected by alteration works or enforcement actions under the BHU regulatory regime in the future and have imminent rehousing needs. For information on the application for TH, please visit the Housing Bureau's website www.hb.gov.hk/eng/policy/housing/policy/transitional/tenantapplications.html.

Before the Ordinance comes into effect on March 1, 2026, the Government will carry out various publicity activities in due course, including launching a thematic website, maintaining continued and close liaison with stakeholders such as professional bodies and estate agents, arranging talks or seminars at the district level, distributing promotional materials, and broadcasting promotional videos, with the aim of helping SDU owners/operators, tenants and other stakeholders understand how to comply with the BHU regulatory regime through different channels.

Note:
The Government will reduce/waive fees for recognition applications during the first three years of the launch of the BHU regulatory regime (i.e. from March 1, 2026, to February 28, 2029). The specific arrangement is as follows:

(a) flats with registration applications made during the first six months of the registration period (i.e. from March 1 to August 31, 2026) will enjoy a full waiver for recognition application in the first three years (i.e. from March 1, 2026, to February 28, 2029) and will have to pay the full price ($3,000) starting from the fourth year (i.e. starting from March 1, 2029);

(b) flats with registration applications made during the last six months of the registration period (i.e. from September 1, 2026, to February 28, 2027) will enjoy a full waiver for recognition applications in the first two years (i.e. from March 1, 2026, to February 29, 2028), half price ($1,500) in the third year (i.e. from March 1, 2028, to February 28, 2029) and will have to pay full price ($3,000) starting from the fourth year (i.e. starting from March 1, 2029); and

(c) other recognition applications can enjoy a full waiver in the first year (i.e. from March 1, 2026, to February 28, 2027), half price ($1,500) from the second to the third year (i.e. from March 1, 2027, to February 28, 2028) and will have to pay full price ($3,000) starting from the fourth year (i.e. starting from March 1, 2029).

​《簡樸房條例》將於二○二六年三月一日生效,2025-10-03 12:30,2025-10-03 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100200760.htm,"政府今日（十月三日）於憲報刊登《簡樸房條例》（《條例》），《條例》將於二○二六年三月一日生效，除當中有關違法出租分間單位罪行的條文則將於二○二七年三月一日起生效。

《條例》旨在為出租住宅樓宇分間單位由二○二六年三月一日起引入規管制度（即「簡樸房」規管制度），要求住宅樓宇分間單位符合居住環境的最低標準（包括最低面積、最低高度、消防安全、結構安全、獨立廁所、供水要求、照明通風，以及獨立水電錶），並取得「簡樸房」認證，方可合法出租作居住用途，以確保分間單位能提供安全、衞生和合理的居住環境。

「簡樸房」規管制度將提供48個月的過渡安排，讓分間單位的業主／營運者有時間了解新規管制度，並逐步過渡至符合「簡樸房」的要求。就此，政府會在《條例》生效當日推展為期12個月的登記制度（即至二○二七年二月二十八日），讓現存分間單位進行登記後，便可在登記期結束後享有36個月的寬限期（即二○二七年三月一日至二○三○年二月二十八日），以進行所需的改造工程和申請「簡樸房」認證。登記資格與《條例》於憲報刊登的日子（刊憲日）掛勾，若分間單位所處的住宅單位在刊憲日（即今日）或之前三個月內有至少一份生效的分間單位住宅租賃，該分間單位及同一住宅單位內其他分間單位便屬「現存分間單位」，可以進行上述登記以取得寬限期。為鼓勵分間單位業主／營運者盡早提交登記和認證申請，政府會就認證費用提供「早鳥」減免優惠，即早登記早申請的話，申請費用便可全免（註）。

在「簡樸房」規管制度下，分間單位是指住用建築物或綜合用途建築物住用部分的住宅單位，經分間／重新分間後，使其布局與參照建築圖則上所顯示的布局有所不同，並在改動後有兩個或以上設計作獨立住宅租賃用途的隔間。換言之，若個別住宅單位沒有在參照建築圖則的基礎上作改動，出租該住宅單位內的房間作居住用途不屬《條例》的規管範圍。此外，就私人住宅單位而言，「參照建築圖則」一般是指獲屋宇署發出佔用許可證（俗稱「入伙紙」）的相關獲准建築圖則；如相關住宅單位在取得入伙紙之後並在刊憲日之前，有獲屋宇署確認完工的建築工程以改動單位內的布局，則該相關獲准建築圖則會視為「參照建築圖則」，以較新者為準。

因應現時全港有約11萬個住宅樓宇分間單位，涉及約22萬名居民，政府會以務實、以民為本的宗旨，並配合未來「簡樸房」及公營房屋的供應，在登記期完結後（即二○二七年三月一日起），有序地對違法出租無登記及無認證的分間單位，採取執法行動。隨着「簡樸房」規管制度的推展，政府理解有部分分間單位住戶可能因相關業主／營運者需要安排改造工程以取得「簡樸房」認證，又或因政府日後的執法行動而受影響，令該些住戶未必能夠在短時間內覓得其他合適的居所。若有關住戶符合申請「簡約公屋」或過渡性房屋的資格，正在及陸續落成營運的項目可以為他們提供充足的住屋選擇。政府亦理解部分住戶未能符合相關申請資格，例如入息／資產超額，因此政府早前已公布於今日起在過渡性房屋新增「丙類租戶」類別，為日後受「簡樸房」規管制度相關的改造工程或執法行動影響、並且有迫切安置需要的人士提供短暫居所。有關申請過渡性房屋的各項資訊，可瀏覽房屋局網站www.hb.gov.hk/tc/policy/housing/policy/transitional/tenantapplications.html。

在二○二六年三月一日《條例》生效前，政府會適時推展不同的宣傳工作，包括推出專題網頁、繼續與專業團體、地產代理等持份者保持密切聯繫、在地區層面安排講座或研討會、派發宣傳品、播放宣傳短片等，務求透過不同渠道協助分間單位業主／營運者、租客及其他持份者了解並遵從「簡樸房」規管制度。

註：
政府會在「簡樸房」規管制度推行的首三年（即二○二六年三月一日至二○二九年二月二十八日），寬減／寬免認證申請費用，具體安排如下：

（一）在登記期首半年（即二○二六年三月一日至八月三十一日）提交登記申請的單位，可獲首三年（即二○二六年三月一日至二○二九年二月二十八日）豁免認證申請費用，而第四年開始（即二○二九年三月一日起）則需支付全額認證申請費用（3,000元）；

（二）在登記期後半年（即二○二六年九月一日至二○二七年二月二十八日）提交登記申請的單位，可獲首兩年（即二○二六年三月一日至二○二八年二月二十九日）豁免認證申請費用，第三年期間（即二○二八年三月一日至二○二九年二月二十八日）需支付半額認證申請費用（1,500元），而第四年開始（即二○二九年三月一日起）則需支付全額認證申請費用（3,000元）；及

（三）就其他的認證申請，可獲首年（即二○二六年三月一日至二○二七年二月二十八日）豁免認證申請費用，第二至三年期間（即二○二七年三月一日至二○二八年二月二十八日）需支付半額認證申請費用（1,500元），而第四年開始（即二○二九年三月一日起）則需支付全額費用（3,000元）。"

"Hongkong Post to issue ""Aviation Development in Hong Kong"" special stamps (with photos)",2025-10-03 12:00,2025-10-03 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100200688.htm,"âHongkong Post announced today (October 3) that a set of special stamps and associated philatelic products on the theme of ""Aviation Development in Hong Kong"" will be released for sale on October 21 (Tuesday).

Hong Kong's airport plays an indispensable role in the successful development of Hong Kong into an international aviation hub. The first recorded flight at Kai Tak took place 100 years ago. Kai Tak later evolved into an airport and the passenger terminal of Kai Tak Airport was completed and commenced service in the 1960s. Though operating only with a single runway, Kai Tak Airport had become one of the busiest airports in the world by the 1990s. For long-term development, Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) was relocated to Chek Lap Kok in 1998, and has since gradually expanded to have a dual-runway and now a three-runway system.

Moreover, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Airport Authority Hong Kong are pressing ahead with the Airport City development strategy, under which HKIA will be transformed into a node of various economic activities. Hongkong Post will issue a set of special stamps and associated philatelic products on the theme of ""Aviation Development in Hong Kong"" to feature the thriving aviation development in the city.

Official first day covers for ""Aviation Development in Hong Kong"" will be on sale at all post offices and Hongkong Post's online shopping platform ShopThruPost (shopthrupost.hongkongpost.hk) from October 6. This set of special stamps and associated philatelic products will be on sale at all post offices and ShopThruPost from October 21, while serviced first day covers affixed with the special stamps and postage prepaid picture cards (air mail) will be available at philatelic offices only.

A hand-back date-stamping service will be provided on October 21 at all post offices for official first day covers/souvenir covers/privately made covers bearing the first day of issue indication and a local address.

Information about this set of special stamps and associated philatelic products is available on the Hongkong Post Stamps website (stamps.hongkongpost.hk)."
Extension of opening hours and special traffic arrangements of FEHD's columbaria during Chung Yeung Festival,2025-10-03 12:00,2025-10-03 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300285.htm,"A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (October 3) said that the opening hours of columbaria under the FEHD will be extended to 7am to 7pm during the Chung Yeung Festival period (i.e. from October 11 to November 9) to assist grave sweepers as well as to alleviate crowd conditions. The department appealed to grave sweepers to avoid grave-sweeping activities during the peak period on the day of the Chung Yeung Festival, and pay tribute to ancestors over a wider period before and after the festival.

Public urged to support Breast Cancer Awareness Month by adopting healthy lifestyle and participating in risk-based breast cancer screenings,2025-10-03 11:29,2025-10-03 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300294.htm,"âThe Department of Health (DH) today (October 3) urged the public to support Breast Cancer Awareness Month by adopting a healthy lifestyle and undergoing risk-based screenings to prevent breast cancer. The Government attaches great importance to cancer prevention and control work, including the launch of the Breast Cancer Screening Pilot Programme (BCSPP) in 2021. Among the breast cancer cases identified, the vast majority were at early stages, which shows that risk-based screening can enhance the recovery rate of breast cancer patients through early detection and treatment.

  ""Breast cancer is the most common cancer among females and the third leading cause of cancer deaths among females in Hong Kong. In 2022, there were 5 182 newly diagnosed invasive female breast cancer cases, accounting for 28.6 per cent of all new cancer cases in women in Hong Kong. In 2023, the disease led to 834 deaths among women, accounting for 13.1 per cent of female cancer deaths. The DH has been promoting the adoption of a healthy lifestyle as primary prevention of cancer, including avoiding tobacco and alcohol, eating a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and maintaining a healthy body weight. The DH also promotes breast awareness and breastfeeding as ways to prevent breast cancer. Screening, as secondary prevention, enables the early detection and treatment of breast cancer and enhances the recovery rate,"" said the Controller of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Phase I of the BCSPP was launched in 2021. From 2021 to 2024, over 37 000 women aged between 44 and 69 at moderate and average risk have received breast cancer risk assessment. The Pilot Programme showed that 97 per cent of breast cancer cases identified through screening were at early stages (stage II or below). The breast cancer risk assessment and screening have been included as part of the services provided by the Woman Health Service and the Elderly Health Service in 2024.

Phase II of the BCSPP was launched in June 2025 to provide subsidised breast cancer screening services to female Hong Kong residents aged 35 to 74 who are at high risk of developing breast cancer (see Annex 1 for details). Eligible women can receive a high level of government subsidy for annual mammography (MMG) screening. Additional ultrasound will be arranged for those who are confirmed to carry specific genetic mutations. For Phase II of the BCSPP, the DH collaborates with three non-governmental organisations (NGOs) through public-private partnership programmes. Eligible women may contact any one of the three NGOs' designated clinics (see Annex 2) to make an appointment for assessment. Currently, all service providers do not charge any co-payment from the service users. As of September 28, over 800 women at high risk have undergone MMG screening, with more than 30 referred to specialists for follow-up due to abnormal screening results. The Government will evaluate the effectiveness of Phase II of the BCSPP in a timely manner and review the future development of breast cancer screening.

Meanwhile, to utilise resources more effectively and expand the multidisciplinary primary healthcare service network, the DH's women health services provided at the Woman Health Centres and the designated Maternal and Child Health Centres are being integrated into the district health network of the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission). During the transition period of service integration, those who have already paid their annual fee and are still within the service period will continue to receive relevant services from the DH. The PHC Commission has commenced the integration of women's health services this year in an orderly manner, whereby women's primary healthcare services are provided through three service points named Women Wellness Satellites (WWS), which form a network with District Health Centres/Expresses (collectively DHCs) in 18 districts, and gradually replace the Woman Health Service of the DH.

Women aged 64 or below who wish to receive women's health services must first register as members of the DHCs. The DHCs will arrange health risk and basic women's health assessments as well as family doctor pairing, and arrange for them to receive services at WWSs as needed. For more information, members of the public can visit the WWSwebsite. Those aged 65 to 69 will continue to receive services at theElderly Health Centres of the DH. To address the preventive and screening needs of underprivileged groups, DHCs are in parallel arranging for women who are Comprehensive Social Security Assistance recipients or holders of valid Certificate for Waiver of Medical Charges to receive the same preventive care and health promotion services for women at selected HA General Out-patient Clinics.

October is designated as Breast Cancer Awareness Month every year to highlight the importance of screenings and promote healthy lifestyle habits to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer. The DH reminds the public that the symptoms of breast cancer at an early stage are often subtle. Women should familiarise themselves with the normal look and feel of their breasts. If any abnormal changes are noticed, such as lumps in the breast or armpit, dimpling or ""orange-skin"" appearance of the breast, changes in size or shape, and rash around, in-drawing of, abnormal discharge or bleeding from the nipple, they should seek medical attention as soon as possible."

「根據《林區及郊區條例》（第96章），任何人在郊野公園或郊區非法生火或用火即屬違法。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二萬五千元及入獄一年。」

發言人亦提醒遊人必須保持郊區清潔，妥善處理垃圾。任何人在郊野公園範圍亂拋垃圾，可被定額罰款三千元。署方會加派人員在郊野公園巡邏，如發現違規情況，會採取執法行動。"
Ombudsman announces results of full investigation into Transport Department's lack of transparency in relocating toll point at Western Harbour Crossing (with photo),2025-10-03 11:00,2025-10-03 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300296.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (October 3) announced the completion of a full investigation into the Transport Department (TD)'s lack of transparency in relocating the toll point at the Western Harbour Crossing (WHC), with nine recommendations on improvement measures made.

The TD has installed a primary and a backup toll point for each direction of travel at all its toll tunnels (including the WHC). When the primary toll point is suspended from service due to facility maintenance or roadworks, the toll collection will be switched to the backup toll point. The TD activates the corresponding Toll Information Display to indicate the toll point in operation. Upon review, the TD confirmed that on the southbound lane of the WHC only two locations (the Kowloon entrance and the Hong Kong Island exit) were suitable for installing toll points. The two locations are approximately two kilometres apart, a distance greater than the typical 200-metre separation between primary and backup toll points at other tunnels. As a result, there is a noticeable interval between the times for those vehicles passing through the two toll points during the transition time slot, thus affecting the toll charged.

Mr Chan said, ""The Office of The Ombudsman (Office) received three complaints in which the complainants alleged that when they had driven southbound through the WHC towards Hong Kong Island during the transition time slot in the morning between February and March 2025, they noticed that the Toll Information Display at the Kowloon entrance did not show the real-time tolls, and the tolls charged were slightly higher than what they understood as the usual rate. One of the complainants called the HKeToll customer service hotline (Hotline) to enquire about the matter, but the frontline staff were unable to provide the precise location of the toll point. The complainants criticised the TD for lack of transparency and found it confusing that the TD had relocated the toll point without prior notice.

""The Office's investigation found that the TD had deactivated the primary toll point on the southbound lane of the WHC from January to March 2025 due to roadworks, and the toll collection was switched to the backup toll point. As the Hotline staff were unfamiliar with the locations of the toll points, they were unable to respond to enquiries properly. It is understandable that the relocation of a toll point is required for operational needs. However, the TD would merely turn off the Toll Information Display to indicate that a toll point was inactive. We consider this practice unsatisfactory. Moreover, nearly a month after the toll collection had been switched to the backup toll point, the Hotline staff were still unclear about its location and could not properly respond to the complainant's enquiry, indicating that the TD had not provided Hotline staff with essential and most updated information in advance, nor had it attached importance to training,"" he said.

Following the launch of the full investigation into this case, the TD has responded positively and has started to improve information dissemination regarding the relocation of toll points on the southbound lane of WHC to enhance transparency. The TD will notify the public of a relocation by displaying a conspicuous banner on the HKeToll website and mobile app, and via the TD's website and the HKeMobility mobile app, and on variable message signs along relevant road sections. The current practice of turning off the Toll Information Display at the inactive toll point will be modified to keeping it on to display a message about the relocation of the toll point. The TD has also instructed the management of the relevant toll service provider to strengthen staff training and ensure proper responses to public enquiries.

Overall, the Office has made nine recommendations for improvements to the TD, which mainly include: closely follow up on the system enhancement works for improving information dissemination, and strengthen supervision of the progress of contractors; conduct timely reviews of the effectiveness and operation of the improvement measures; further consider and explore more effective ways to disseminate information about toll point relocations; consider liaising closely with other government departments (such as the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department); step up monitoring of the performance of the HKeToll hotline service provider and clearly set out in operational guidelines the arrangements prior to toll point relocations for compliance by staff. The TD has accepted and implemented all of these recommendations.

The full investigation report has been uploaded to the website of the Office ofThe Ombudsman at www.ombudsman.hk for public information."

""During the Mid-Autumn Festival, visitors shall light or use fire only in designated barbecue sites or designated camping sites in country parks and special areas, and ensure all kindling is fully extinguished before leaving to prevent hill fires,"" an AFCD spokesman said.

""It is an offence under the Forests and Countryside Ordinance (Cap. 96) to illegally light or use a fire in country parks and the open countryside. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of $25,000 and one year's imprisonment upon conviction.""

申訴專員公署公布就運輸署更改西區海底隧道收費點位置欠透明度的全面調查報告（附圖）,2025-10-03 11:00,2025-10-03 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300292.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出︰

申訴專員陳積志今日（十月三日）宣布公署完成運輸署就更改西區海底隧道（西隧）收費點位置欠透明度的全面調查，並向運輸署提出九項改善建議。

運輸署在其每一條收費隧道（包括西隧）內的來回行車方向均設有一個主收費點及備用收費點，當主收費點因維修保養或道路工程須暫停使用時，便會轉換至備用收費點。運輸署透過開啓相應收費點的隧道費顯示屏（顯示屏）表達當刻正在運作的收費點位置。至於西隧經檢視後，運輸署確定南行方向只有兩個位置適合設置收費點，分別位於九龍入口和港島出口，相距約兩公里，較其他隧道的兩個收費點一般相距約200米為遠，因此，相關車輛在「過渡時段」駛經主收費點和備用收費點的時間會有較明顯的差距，因而影響被徵收的隧道費。

陳積志表示：「公署接獲三名申訴人指稱他們在二○二五年二月至三月期間上午的『過渡時段』內駕車經西隧南行往港島時發現九龍入口的顯示屏並沒有顯示實時隧道費，而所收取的隧道費亦較認知中一向收取的稍高。當中有申訴人致電『易通行』客戶服務熱線（熱線）查詢，但職員未能告知確實收費點的位置，資訊有欠透明，令申訴人對運輸署未有預先通知便更改收費點位置感到困惑。」

「公署調查發現，運輸署曾因應道路工程於二○二五年一月至三月期間關閉西隧南行的主收費點，並以備用收費點收費。由於熱線職員不熟悉收費點的位置，故未能妥善回應查詢。公署認為，運輸署因實際運作需要轉換收費點，實無可厚非，但在轉換收費點時只以關閉顯示屏的方式表達相關收費點不在運作中，做法有欠理想。另外，熱線職員在更改了收費點近一個月後仍然未能掌握後備收費點的位置以回應申訴人的查詢，反映運輸署未有預早為熱線職員提供重要及最新資訊，亦沒有重視培訓的需要。」

在公署就本案展開全面調查後，運輸署從善如流，並已着手優化西隧南行轉換收費點時的資訊發放安排，提升透明度。運輸署會透過「易通行」網頁及流動應用程式內顯眼的橫額消息、運輸署網頁和「香港出行易」流動應用程式，以及相關路段的可變信息顯示屏，向公眾發放轉換收費點的資訊。另外，非運作中收費點的顯示屏會由現時的關閉模式改為繼續開啓及顯示收費點已轉換的提示信息。運輸署亦已責成隧道費服務商管理層加強熱線職員的培訓，以確保他們能妥善回應公眾的查詢。

整體而言，公署對運輸署提出九項改善建議，主要包括：繼續密切跟進上述資訊發放優化安排的系統改善工程，以及加強監督承建商的處理進度；適時檢討優化安排措施的成效和運作；進一步研究如何更有效向公眾傳遞轉換收費點信息的途徑；考慮與其他政府部門（如機電工程署）作緊密聯繫；加強監察「易通行」服務熱線的服務商表現，以及於工作指引明確訂明有關轉換收費點的安排措施，讓職員有所依從。運輸署已接納及落實公署提出的各項建議。

全面調查報告已上載至申訴專員公署網頁www.ombudsman.hk供公眾參閱。"

立法會於九月二十六日通過兩項決議，將《僱員補償條例》及《肺塵埃沉着病及間皮瘤（補償）條例》（《肺塵病條例》）下門診治療的醫療費最高每天限額由300元上調至500元、同一天接受住院及門診治療的醫療費最高每天限額由370元調高至700元，而住院治療的醫療費最高每天限額則維持為300元，為工傷僱員及訂明職業病患者提供更佳的醫療費保障。

勞工處發言人表示：「一般而言，經修訂的數額，足以支付工傷僱員及訂明職業病患者一天內在公營醫院或診所求診時所需的費用，包括診金、治療、注射和敷藥、藥物及入住醫院等費用。」

根據《僱員補償條例》及《肺塵病條例》，工傷僱員及訂明職業病患者如因工傷或訂明職業病接受醫治，可索還實際已支付的醫療費，但不可超過這兩條條例訂明的最高每天限額。

響應乳癌關注月　實踐健康生活和參加風險為本的乳癌篩查,2025-10-03 11:00,2025-10-03 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300240.htm,"衞生署今日（十月三日）呼籲市民響應乳癌關注月，透過實踐健康生活模式和進行風險為本的篩查，預防患上乳癌。政府十分重視癌症的防控工作，其中包括於二○二一年推出的乳癌篩查先導計劃，當中絕大部分確診為乳癌的為早期癌症，顯示以風險為本的篩查能及早發現及治療乳癌，提升患者康復機會。

 衞生署衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生表示：「乳癌是本港最常見的女性癌症，亦是本港女性致命癌症的第三位。在二○二二年，有5 182宗確診乳癌（入侵性乳癌）的女性新症，佔本港女性癌症新症總數的28.6%。在二○二三年，乳癌導致834名女性死亡，佔女性癌症死亡總數的13.1%。衞生署一直推廣健康的生活模式作為首要的預防癌症策略，包括避免煙酒、健康飲食、恆常體能活動及保持健康體重；並向婦女推廣關注乳房健康及母乳餵哺以預防乳癌。而接受篩查則是第二重預防工具，讓婦女及早發現及治療乳癌，從而提升康復機會。」

第一階段乳癌篩查先導計劃於二○二一年展開。在二○二一至二○二四年，共有超過37 000名年齡介乎44至69歲的中風險及一般風險女性接受乳癌風險評估。先導計劃顯示通過乳癌篩查確診的患者97%為早期癌症（第二期或以下）。 乳癌風險評估及篩查已於二○二四年納入衞生署的婦女健康服務及長者健康服務。

第二階段乳癌篩查先導計劃於今年六月開展服務，為年齡介乎35歲至74歲，並屬高風險罹患乳癌（詳情請參閱附件一）的香港女性居民提供資助篩查服務。合資格人士可獲政府高度資助接受每年一次的乳房X光造影檢查。另外，確定帶有特定基因突變的人士，將額外獲安排接受超聲波乳房檢查。第二階段先導計劃透過公私營協作計劃與三間非政府組織合作。合資格婦女可聯絡服務提供者的指定診所（見附件二）預約評估。目前所有服務提供者均不會向服務使用者收取任何共付額。截至九月二十八日，超過800名高風險婦女已接受乳房X光造影篩查，當中有超過30名因篩查結果異常而獲轉介至專科醫生跟進。政府會適時檢討先導計劃成效，並審視乳癌篩查的長遠發展。

 另一方面，為令資源更有效地運用，並擴展跨專業基層醫療服務網絡，衞生署的婦女健康中心和指定母嬰健康院提供的婦女健康服務正整合至基層醫療署的地區康健網絡。在服務整合的過渡期間，已繳交年費並仍在服務期內的人士，會繼續在衞生署接受服務。基層醫療署已於今年有序啓動整合婦女健康服務，透過三間名為「樂妍站」的服務點，與全港十八區的地區康健中心組成網絡提供女性基層醫療服務，陸續取代衞生署的婦女健康服務。

 有意接受婦女健康服務（包括乳癌篩查）的64歲或以下的婦女，須先登記成為地區康健中心／站（統稱康健中心）的會員。康健中心會為她們安排健康風險及基本婦女健康評估和配對家庭醫生，再按需要安排她們到「樂妍站」接受服務。市民可瀏覽「樂妍站」網站了解更多資訊。而65歲至69歲婦女則維持於衞生署長者健康中心接受服務。同時，為照顧弱勢社群的預防及篩查需要，就綜合社會保障援助受助人或獲醫療費用減免的婦女，康健中心會安排她們到選定的醫院管理局普通科門診，接受相同的預防性婦女保健及健康促進服務。

每年的十月被定為乳癌關注月，以宣揚乳癌篩查的重要性，並推廣健康生活習慣，冀降低大眾患上乳癌的風險。衞生署提醒，乳癌的早期症狀不易察覺，因此女性應熟悉自己乳房平常的外觀和觸感。如發現有異常的變化例如乳房或腋下有硬塊；乳房出現點狀凹陷或橙皮紋、形狀或大小有改變；乳頭附近出疹、內陷或有異常分泌物或流血等，應該盡早求醫。"
Maximum daily rates of reimbursable medical expenses adjusted for employees injured at work and occupational disease sufferers,2025-10-03 11:00,2025-10-03 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025093000271.htm,"The Labour Department (LD) today (October 3) announced that the maximum daily rates of medical expenses reimbursable by employees injured at work and prescribed occupational disease sufferers who have received medical treatment in respect of a work injury or a prescribed occupational disease will be adjusted from January 1, 2026.

The Legislative Council on September 26 passed two resolutions to increase the maximum daily rate of medical expenses for out-patient treatment under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance (ECO) and the Pneumoconiosis and Mesothelioma (Compensation) Ordinance (PMCO) from $300 to $500 and the maximum daily rate of medical expenses for in-patient and out-patient treatment received on the same day from $370 to $700, while maintaining the maximum daily rate of medical expenses for in-patient treatment at $300, enabling injured employees and prescribed occupational disease sufferers to receive enhanced protection on medical expenses. 

""In general, the revised rates can cover the expenses incurred by injured employees and prescribed occupational disease sufferers on consultation, treatment/therapy, injection and dressing, medicines and hospitalisation, etc, on a day in a public hospital or clinic,"" a spokesman for the LD said.

Under the ECO and the PMCO, injured employees and prescribed occupational disease sufferers who have received medical treatment in respect of a work injury or a prescribed occupational disease may claim reimbursement of the actual amount of medical expenses incurred, subject to the maximum daily rates specified in the two Ordinances.

The revised maximum daily rates of reimbursable medical expenses were gazetted today and will take effect from January 1, 2026. For medical treatment received on or after the effective date meeting the relevant provisions of the ECO or the PMCO, the new maximum daily rates of reimbursable medical expenses will be applicable."

保安局局長在立法會保安事務委員會政策簡報會開場發言（只有中文）,2025-10-03 10:29,2025-10-03 11:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300250.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（十月三日）在立法會保安事務委員會政策簡報會的開場發言：

主席、各位委員：

首先，今次是本屆立法會保安事務委員會的最後一次會議，我要衷心感謝各位委員在過去幾年對保安局工作的支持和提出了各類寶貴的意見。我記得我們一起審議《維護國家安全條例》和相關附屬法例，也一起審議《保護關鍵基礎設施（電腦系統）條例》，也就着《監獄規則》的修訂和一些與消防安全相關的修訂，大家都作出詳盡審議，給予很多寶貴意見，為這些條例的通過提供堅實的基礎，亦進一步強化了我們在維護國家安全和保障市民安全方面的工作。我再次向主席和各位委員表示衷心致謝。

今日，我會向各位委員扼要介紹今年《施政報告》中，保安局的五大政策範疇。

主題一：國安家安

第一個主題是國安家安。除持續完善法律制度和執行機制，全力防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全行為和活動外，我們會繼續將宣傳及教育工作做得更深更廣。

我們於今年初推出《安仔與熊仔》實體繪本，深受歡迎，有關系列亦會在本學年以短劇形式向小學生呈現。此外，我們計劃以該系列為藍本，公演國安話劇，鼓勵年輕一代主動肩負維護國家安全的重要使命。

另外，約80名保安局青少年制服團隊領袖論壇義工會到幼稚園參與以《安仔與熊仔》為主題的工作坊，將國安信息帶入幼稚園。

主題二：滅罪應急

第二個主題是滅罪應急。我們計劃於二○二六年第一季就性罪行法例修訂建議諮詢公眾，隨後向立法會提交修訂條例草案，目標是在本屆政府任期內完成立法。

而在推動數碼警政發展方面，警務處將推出人工智能警務站，市民可透過語音向智能虛擬警務大使作出非緊急報案。警務處計劃於二○二六年第二季，在港鐵中環站設置首個人工智能警務站。

此外，警務處亦積極推行無人機警政。繼於今年五月在邊界警區及西九龍總區試行後，警務處將於今年內進一步擴展至長洲分區和中區警區，執行飛行任務，以提升巡邏效率。

警方亦將於今年內成立虛擬資產情報工作組，聯同本地持牌虛擬資產交易平台及監管機構，透過情報交流及知識共享等，打擊相關罪案。

在打擊毒品方面，警務處和海關會持續掃蕩。我們亦會繼續在宣傳中利用「依托咪酯──食咗變喪屍！死咗無人知！」為題，突顯該毒品的禍害。

打擊非法勞工方面，我必須重申，從事非法工作屬嚴重罪行，非法勞工、僱主及協助和教唆他人從事非法工作的人均會被檢控。為加大打擊力度，我們已成立「跨部門反黑工專責組」，並推出新的舉報非法勞工專線，電話號碼是3861 5000。政府嚴打非法勞工亦有助減低濫用免遣返聲請機制的經濟誘因。政府會繼續採取多管齊下的策略以高效率處理聲請，盡快遣送聲請不獲確立者離開香港，從而減低聲請人滯港對社會所帶來的沉重負擔和安全風險。

在救援方面，消防處將於二○二五年年底前在醫院管理局新界東及新界西聯網推行「院前中風分流計劃」，將懷疑大血管閉塞中風病人直接送往指定醫院接受治療，爭取提前治療時間，減少腦損傷。

更生方面，懲教署將於二○二五年年底前為刑期少於一年的在囚人士由入獄至釋放後提供「一條龍」更生服務，從而減低再犯風險。

主題三：便民利商

第三個主題是便民利商。我們將在二○二六年年中取消米埔的邊境禁區，並開放沙頭角海的禁區範圍，讓旅客可申請禁區許可證前往遊覽。實施後，除過境設施及邊界巡邏路外，所有的邊境禁區都會予以開放。

此外，我們會繼續提升口岸基礎建設和通關能力。重建後的皇崗口岸將實施「一地兩檢」的安排，並採用嶄新的「合作查驗、一次放行」通關模式。我們爭取於本屆政府任期內讓該口岸具備落成啓用條件。

沙頭角口岸項目則將以「跨河建」安排重建，並實施「合作查驗、一次放行」的通關模式。該口岸重建後將成為純旅檢口岸。該工程可行性研究預計於二○二五年內完成。

另外，入境處將於二○二六年第一季起推出優化訪港旅客使用e-道服務的安排，包括︰

（i）於機場入境大堂加設共26條e-道，並更新現有e-道；及

（ii）放寬經常訪港旅客使用e-道的登記條件至過去24個月內曾經機場訪港兩次或以上的人士。

同時，為便利跨境旅客，我們已於二○二五年九月底推出一站式過關資訊平台「口岸通」，提供各陸路管制站的即時過關及其他有用資訊。下一階段，我們將引入實時影像，透過先進科技，例如人工智能，評估陸路管制站的實時過關情況。

我們亦已於《施政報告》當日起放寬吉爾吉斯斯坦、塔吉克斯坦、土庫曼斯坦和烏茲別克斯坦公民的商務和旅遊多次訪港簽證申請門檻。

而為配合盛事經濟，消防處會優化現時臨時公眾娛樂場所牌照申請的消防驗收流程，在二○二六年第一季推行以視像方式為安全風險較低的活動場地進行消防驗收。消防處亦將於二○二五年年底前實施註冊消防工程師計劃，讓公眾可聘用註冊消防工程師提供消防安全風險評估及發出證明書服務。

主題四：善用科技

第四個主題是善用科技。自「銳眼」計劃推出，在罪案較多及人流較多的公眾地方安裝閉路電視以來，成效顯著。截至二○二五年八月三十一日，已協助警方偵破433宗案件，拘捕787人。警務處將進一步推展該計劃，每年增加超過20 000支鏡頭，預計於二○二八年有共約60 000支鏡頭覆蓋全港。

警務處亦將把俗稱「良民證」的「無犯罪紀錄證明書」的申請程序全面電子化。市民可透過「智方便」全程網上申請，無需提交指紋。

在消防安全改善工程方面，為向業主提供更好的支援，消防處將於二○二五年年底前推行「物聯網火警偵測系統先導計劃」，探討以該系統及滅火筒作為替代方案，讓六層或以下的目標樓宇免卻裝設消防喉轆、消防水缸和水泵等消防裝置。先導計劃將於10幢目標樓宇推行。

消防處亦計劃於二○二六年第一季前引入負重較大的無人機吊運更重的救援工具，及引入自動化無人機機場，在避風塘或郊野等地區自動定期巡邏，並配合人工智能技術以偵測早期火災。

而出入境方面，入境處於二○二五年九月底在機場入境大堂推出e-道新功能，讓合資格的香港居民可免登記、免出示旅行證件或二維碼，於機場入境時，以容貌辨識技術核實身分及辦理入境手續。

另外，入境處將於港珠澳大橋香港口岸設立全港首個「無感通關」試點，讓巿民透過人面辨識科技核實身份，實現不停頓過關。入境處計劃於二○二六年第二季先開放予合資格的香港居民使用。

香港海關亦計劃於二○二五年第四季在羅湖口岸及落馬洲支線口岸引入「海關人工智能影像分析大數據系統」，利用人工智能科技，於各口岸加強識別高走私風險人士。

主題五：說好香港

第五個主題是說好香港。來年，我們會繼續舉行大型國際會議，包括二○二六年國際刑警組織周年大會，更會成立國際協會和學院，強化國際間紀律部隊和專業團體的合作和交流。

我們亦會在二○二六年內安排至少2 000名紀律及輔助部隊青少年制服團隊隊員參與國際及内地交流活動。

以上是我就各項措施的簡單介紹。我們已就各項措施制訂關鍵績效指標，並詳列於附件。我希望能繼續得到委員會的支持，做到特首在《施政報告》提到的「拼經濟謀發展惠民生」、加快邁向「由治及興」，以及主動對接國家發展戰略、實現突破新局面。

多謝主席。"

Nomination for Legislative Council General Election to begin on October 24,2025-10-03 10:00,2025-10-03 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100200751.htm,"The nomination period for the 2025 Legislative Council General Election will run from October 24 (Friday) to November 6 (Thursday).

 The Legislative Council General Election will be held on December 7. A total of 90 members, with 20 from geographical constituencies, 30 from functional constituencies and 40 from the Election Committee constituency, will be returned. The Registration and Electoral Office (REO) issued relevant gazette notices and uploaded relevant information to the election website (www.elections.gov.hk) today (October 3).

 ""To run for a seat in a geographical constituency, a functional constituency or the Election Committee constituency, a nominated person must be a registered geographical constituency elector aged 21 or above. He or she must also have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for three years immediately preceding the date of his or her nomination, and must be a Chinese citizen who is a Hong Kong permanent resident with no right of abode in a foreign country,"" a spokesman for the REO said.

 However, candidature in 12 functional constituencies is open to Hong Kong permanent residents who are not Chinese citizens or who have the right of abode in a foreign country. These constituencies are legal; accountancy; engineering; architectural, surveying, planning and landscape; real estate and construction; tourism; commercial (first); industrial (first); finance; financial services; import and export; and insurance.

 ""A nominated person for the functional constituency election must be a registered elector for, or have a substantial connection with, the relevant functional constituency. For the Election Committee constituency election, a nominated person needs not be a member of the Election Committee,"" the spokesman said.

 Details on the eligibility to be nominated as a candidate and disqualification from being nominated as a candidate and from being elected as a Member, as well as the requirements to be complied with by persons nominated as candidates, are set out in sections 37, 39 and 40 respectively of the Legislative Council Ordinance (Cap. 542).

 For the geographical constituency election, each nominated person needs to be subscribed by at least 100 but not more than 200 registered electors of the constituency concerned, and an elector may subscribe only one nomination of the geographical constituency in the capacity as an elector in respect of his/her own geographical constituency. Each nominated person for the geographical constituency election must also be subscribed by at least 10 but not more than 20 members of the Election Committee, which must include at least two but not more than four members from each of the five sectors of the Election Committee. A member of the Election Committee may subscribe only one nomination form of the geographical constituency election in his/her capacity as a member of the Election Committee.

 Each nominated person for the functional constituency election must be subscribed by at least 10 but not more than 20 registered electors of the constituency concerned and an elector may subscribe any number of nomination forms up to the number of seats in his/her functional constituency. Each nominated person for the functional constituency election must also be subscribed by at least 10 but not more than 20 members of the Election Committee, which must include at least two but not more than four members from each of the five sectors of the Election Committee. A member of the Election Committee may subscribe only one nomination form of the functional constituency election in his/her capacity as a member of the Election Committee.

 For the Election Committee constituency election, each nominated person must be subscribed by at least 10 but not more than 20 members of the Election Committee, which must include at least two but not more than four members from each of the five sectors of the Election Committee. A member of the Election Committee may subscribe only one nomination form of the Election Committee constituency election.

 The Electoral Affairs Commission has appointed Returning Officers for the 10 geographical constituencies, 28 functional constituencies and the Election Committee constituency to receive nomination forms and to handle other electoral matters. Notices for the election and the appointment of Returning Officers, with their office addresses, were also gazetted today and uploaded to the election website.

 The nomination forms may be obtained during ordinary business hours from 9am to 5pm on Mondays to Fridays and from 9am to noon on Saturdays (except public holidays) beginning today at the two offices of the REO (8/F, Treasury Building, 3 Tonkin Street West, Cheung Sha Wan, Kowloon, and Unit 2301-03, 23/F, Millennium City 6, 392 Kwun Tong Road, Kwun Tong, Kowloon), or at the offices of the Returning Officers of the relevant constituencies. The nomination forms may also be obtained from any of the District Offices during their operation hours, or downloaded from the election website.

 A nominated person must submit the completed nomination form and an election deposit in person to the respective Returning Officer during the abovementioned ordinary business hours (except public holidays) within the nomination period. A deposit of $50,000 needs to be paid by each nominated person for the geographical constituency election. Each nominated person for the functional constituency election or the Election Committee constituency election has to pay an election deposit of $25,000. The spokesman reminded those nominated persons that they may consider lodging the election deposit by Faster Payment System (FPS) newly introduced this year (but attention should be paid to the transfer limit setting of the relevant account), or by cash and cashier orders to avoid any complications arising from a cheque not being honoured.

 ""The nominated persons are advised to submit their nomination forms as early as possible to allow time to correct mistakes, if any, in the forms before the nomination deadline,"" the spokesman added.

 Separately, the nominated persons must, in accordance with the requirements of the Candidate Eligibility Review Committee (CERC), complete and return the Eligibility Review Supplementary Information Form (SIF). The SIF is distributed together with the nomination forms and can be downloaded from the election website. Nominated persons should put the completed SIF in a separate and sealed envelope and hand it in person together with the nomination form to the office of the Returning Officer within the nomination period for onward transmission to the CERC Secretariat. Nominated persons can also submit the completed SIF to the CERC Secretariat directly as soon as possible but no later than 5pm on November 6 through any of the following means:

email to cerc_secretariat@cerc.gov.hk;
fax to 2505 0673; or
return to the drop-in box of the CERC Secretariat at the entrance on 2/F, East Wing, Central Government Offices, 2 Tim Mei Avenue, Tamar, Hong Kong.

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-10-03 06:46,2025-10-03 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300010.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 3) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

CEDB briefs Trade and Industry Advisory Board on Policy Address (with photos),2025-10-02 19:30,2025-10-02 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/02/P2025100200523.htm,"  The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, briefed members of the Trade and Industry Advisory Board on major initiatives related to promoting economic and trade developments and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" at a meeting today (October 2).

  Mr Yau said that the Policy Address has set out a series of initiatives to better leverage Hong Kong's unique advantages of being closely connected to both the Mainland and the world under the ""one country, two systems"" principle to actively explore new economic growth areas. To more proactively support Mainland enterprises going global, the Government will establish a one-stop platform by mobilising Hong Kong's overseas offices, including those under Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), as well as Hong Kong offices on the Mainland, and set up the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global to encourage Mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong in expanding their businesses overseas and to formulate proposals for them. The target is to discuss strategies and work plan of the Task Force, and organise the first large-scale promotion event by the end of this year.

  Mr Yau stressed that the Government is committed to expanding international economic and trade networks, and deepening international exchanges and co-operation to consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's status as an international trade centre. The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (ETO) in Kuala Lumpur will come into operation progressively by the end of this year, and the Government will expand the coverage of the current ETOs in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to deepen economic and trade promotion in ASEAN and neighbouring countries, and plan to expand the ETO coverage to more markets with potential. In addition, the Government will continue to proactively take forward the work on free trade agreements and investment agreements.

  Mr Yau highlighted that the Policy Address has strengthened relevant support for SMEs in view of the challenges facing them due to external influences. The application period for the 80% Guarantee Product under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme will be extended for two years, and the principal moratorium arrangement will be further extended for one year. In addition, to assist SMEs in expanding into more diversified markets, the Government will inject $1.43 billion into the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales (BUD Fund) and expand its geographical scope to cover eight more economies, including Belt and Road countries. Meanwhile, the Government will enhance promotion and facilitate the participation of enterprises in exhibitions and export marketing activities through ""Easy BUD"".

  The Government will also assist SMEs in developing cross-border e-commerce business, including supporting the continued organisation of the Hong Kong Shopping Festival, covering the Mainland and ASEAN e-commerce markets over the next three years, implementing the ""Creativity • Ecommerceâ¯–â¯Beyond Limits"" programme and providing one-stop business matching and referral services. The Hong Kong Export Credit Insurance Corporation (HKECIC) will also increase financing support for local e-commerce businesses on different e-commerce platforms and further expand the coverage of free buyer credit checks to all markets insured by the HKECIC.

  Mr Yau added that the Government will set up the ""Economic and Trade Express"", joining the efforts of ETOs and overseas offices of InvestHK and the HKTDC to form a functional platform to enhance synergy, encouraging local SMEs and start-ups to conduct overseas visits to explore more business opportunities.

  On intellectual property (IP), the Government will assist innovative enterprises in leveraging IPs for financing to enhance the IP trade ecosystem. This includes launching an IP financing sandbox pilot project, providing patent evaluation for enterprises, launching a pilot programme to subsidise patent valuations and promoting IP financing in the Business of IP Asia Forum, as well as providing training on IP for practitioners in the banking sector.

  Mr Yau also briefed the members on the Government's work in promoting digital trade. On business-to-government trade documents, the Government is pressing ahead with the development of the information technology system of Phase 3 of the Trade Single Window, and will continue its work on connecting the single windows of Hong Kong and the Mainland, as well as exploring the connectivity with the ASEAN Single Window. The Government is also drawing reference to the Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records to consider legislative amendments to provide a legal basis for the digitalisation of business-to-business trade documents.

  Mr Yau said that in the face of the complex and ever-changing global trade landscape and geopolitics, the series of measures will enable Hong Kong to strengthen its dual role as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"", actively integrating into the overall national development while tapping international new markets and creating new impetus for Hong Kong's economy, thereby promoting high-quality economic developments."

  Additionally, Members inspected the project's transportation and ancillary facilities, including a self-service laundrette, minibus stop and convenience store. During the visit, Members exchanged views with government officials on the operation and management of LPH to explore how adequate services and facilities could be provided to address the daily needs of residents. Members indicated that they would maintain ongoing scrutiny and call for the Government's continuous efforts in enhancing the provision of LPH and the related work.

  The Convenor of the Task Force and Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, said, ""It is a serious offence to engage in illegal employment. Illegal workers, employers, as well as aiders and abettors of illegal employment will be liable to prosecution in accordance with the Immigration Ordinance (Cap 115). The establishment of the Task Force demonstrates the Government's commitment and determination to combat illegal employment. The Task Force will combat illegal employment from various aspects, targeting individual key industries.""

食安中心公布月餅時令食品調查結果（附圖）,2025-10-02 19:00,2025-10-02 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/02/P2025100200611.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（十月二日）公布一項有關月餅的時令食品調查結果，在三百六十五個樣本中，除一個樣本的鈉含量與其營養標籤上的標示值不符，其餘樣本全部通過檢測。中心早前已公布有關違規事項，有關商戶亦已停售受影響批次的產品。如有足夠證據，中心會提出檢控。

中心發言人表示，中心從不同零售商（包括網上零售商）及食物製造廠抽取各式月餅樣本，包括傳統、冰皮、雪糕及其他款式的月餅進行化學、微生物及營養成分測試。

化學測試包括染色料、黃曲霉毒素、金屬雜質、防腐劑、抗氧化劑及礦物油。微生物測試包括不同致病菌及衞生情況指標。營養成分測試（包括能量、蛋白質、總脂肪、飽和脂肪酸、反式脂肪酸、碳水化合物、鈉和糖含量）則檢測樣本是否符合食物標籤規定。

發言人提醒市民應保持均衡飲食，不應過量進食月餅，因為月餅的糖分及脂肪一般較高，有些種類的鹽分亦較高。進食過量脂肪會增加超重和患肥胖症的風險，而膳食中糖的攝取量是體重和蛀牙的決定性因素。此外，攝取過多的鈉會增加患高血壓的機會，亦會增加患上致命性中風及冠心病的風險。

他建議市民參考月餅的營養標籤，了解特別是糖分、鹽分及脂肪的含量，以便作出較健康的選擇。市民應避免選擇高脂肪或高糖的月餅，即每一百克食物含有多於二十克總脂肪或含有多於十五克的糖。在減少攝入鹽方面，可選擇低鈉的月餅，即每一百克食物含有不多於一百二十毫克的鈉。

發言人表示，市民因應個人健康狀況，在中秋節期間可適量進食各式月餅；另建議市民與家人和朋友團聚時一起分享月餅，除增添節日氣氛外，更可淺嘗不同口味的月餅，避免過量進食。

市民在購買、貯存和享用月餅時，應留意以下要點，以預防經由食物傳播的疾病：


向可靠的零售店鋪購買月餅，切勿光顧無牌小販。購買前應留意包裝有否破損及月餅的食用限期，並在限期前進食；
如非即時進食，應按包裝上的說明存放。冰皮月餅應存放在攝氏四度或以下，雪糕月餅則在攝氏零下十八度或以下。從雪櫃取出月餅後，應盡快食用；
攜帶冰皮月餅或雪糕月餅到戶外時，宜使用旅行冰箱並盡快食用；
貯存月餅時，應將包裹妥當的月餅和生的食物分開存放，避免交叉污染；及
保持個人衞生，在處理及享用月餅前以流動的自來水和梘液潔淨雙手。


發言人亦提醒業界，應時刻按「良好衞生規範」配製食品。除向可靠供應商購買食用材料外，在使用食物添加劑時，亦須符合法例要求。

他說：「冰皮月餅和雪糕月餅在製造過程中並沒有經過高溫烘焙，因此在製造、運輸及貯存的過程中，必須注意衞生，以免細菌滋生及污染。」"

Inter-departmental Task Force against Illegal Employment holds first meeting,2025-10-02 19:00,2025-10-02 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/02/P2025100200725.htm,"The Government has long been combating illegal employment. To further step up such efforts, the Security Bureau (SB) established in September 2025 the Inter-departmental Task Force against Illegal Employment. Members of the Task Force include the Labour and Welfare Bureau, the Education Bureau, the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the Immigration Department (ImmD), the Hong Kong Police Force, the Labour Department and the Transport Department. The SB convened the first meeting of the Task Force today (October 2).

At the meeting, the Task Force discussed the current situation of illegal employment, and agreed to enhance interdepartmental co-ordination on various fronts, including formulating overall response strategies against illegal employment, enhancing intelligence collection and intelligence exchange with the Mainland, enforcing the laws rigorously, leveraging technology, and co-ordinating relevant publicity and education, so as to combat illegal employment under a multipronged approach.

  The Convenor of the Task Force and Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, said, ""It is a serious offence to engage in illegal employment. Illegal workers, employers, as well as aiders and abettors of illegal employment will be liable to prosecution in accordance with the Immigration Ordinance (Cap 115). The establishment of the Task Force demonstrates the Government's commitment and determination to combat illegal employment. The Task Force will combat illegal employment from various aspects, targeting individual key industries.""

""The Task Force was established in September 2025. In the same month, the ImmD launched the Dedicated Hotline for Reporting Illegal Workers 3861 5000. Since the launch of the Hotline two weeks ago, the ImmD has already received over 100 reports via telephone. We encourage members of the public to continue to report illegal employment-related activities,"" Mr Tang added.

The Task Force will continue to closely monitor the situation of illegal employment and formulate overall response strategies in a timely manner."
CFS announces test results of seasonal food surveillance project on mooncakes (with photo),2025-10-02 19:00,2025-10-02 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/02/P2025100200615.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (October 2) announced the results of a seasonal food surveillance project on mooncakes. Among 365 samples tested, except for one sample found with sodium content inconsistent with the declared value on its nutrition label, all the remaining samples passed the tests. The CFS had announced the irregularity earlier, and the vendor concerned has also stopped selling the relevant batch of the affected product. Prosecution will be instituted should there be sufficient evidence.

A spokesman for the CFS said that samples covering traditional, snowy, ice-cream and other types of mooncakes had been collected from various retailers (including online retailers) and food factories for chemical and microbiological tests and nutrition content analysis.

Chemical tests covered colouring matters, aflatoxins, metallic contaminants, preservatives, antioxidants and mineral oil. Microbiological tests covered various pathogens and hygiene indicators. For nutrition content analyses (covering the contents of energy, protein, total fat, saturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids, carbohydrates, sodium and sugars), the samples were tested to see if they complied with the food labelling requirements.

The spokesman reminded members of the public to maintain a balanced diet and avoid excessive consumption of mooncakes as they are generally high in sugar and fat. Some types of mooncakes also contain relatively high levels of salt. Eating too much fat will increase the risk of being overweight and obese, while dietary sugar intake is a determinant of body weight and dental caries. In addition, excessive sodium intake will increase the risk of developing hypertension, fatal stroke and coronary heart disease.

He advised people to refer to nutrition labels of mooncakes, particularly on the sugar, salt and fat contents, to make a healthier choice. People should avoid choosing mooncakes with high levels of fat or sugar, i.e. containing more than 20 grams of total fat or more than 15g of sugar per 100g of food. As for reducing salt intake, people can choose low-sodium mooncakes, i.e. containing no more than 120 milligrams of sodium per 100g of food.

The spokesman said that people should consider their health conditions and consume mooncakes in an appropriate amount during the Mid-Autumn Festival. He advised people to share mooncakes with their family members and friends, as this not only enhances the festive atmosphere, but also allows them to taste mooncakes of different flavours and avoid overconsumption.

Members of the public should heed the following points in the purchase, storage and consumption of mooncakes to prevent food-borne diseases:


Buy mooncakes from reliable outlets rather than patronising unlicensed hawkers. Check whether the mooncakes are properly packaged, pay attention to the expiry dates before purchase and eat them before the expiry dates;
Store mooncakes according to the instructions on the package if they are not to be consumed immediately. Keep snowy mooncakes at 4 degrees Celsius or below, and ice-cream mooncakes at minus 18 degrees C or below, and consume them as soon as possible after taking them out ofthe refrigerator;
Use an icebox to carry snowy or ice-cream mooncakes outdoors and consume them as soon as possible;
Wrap mooncakes properly and separate them from raw food when storing them in a refrigerator to prevent cross-contamination; and
Maintain good personal hygiene. Wash hands properly with liquid soap and running water before handling and consuming mooncakes.


  The spokesman also reminded food traders to adhere to the Good Hygiene Practices. Apart from purchasing food ingredients from reliable suppliers, they should also comply with legal requirements when using food additives.

  ""Snowy and ice-cream mooncakes, which do not undergo a baking process at high temperature, need to be handled hygienically during processing, transportation and storage to avoid contamination and growth of germs,"" he said."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-02 18:58,2025-10-02 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/02/P2025100200759.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月二日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新個案資料

病人為59歲男子，住所位於黃大仙區。初步調查顯示，他於九月二十三日至二十六日到訪廣東省江門市，期間曾被蚊叮咬。他於九月三十日出現發燒及關節痛，昨日（十月一日）出現皮疹，同日到伊利沙伯醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，目前情況穩定。

病人有三名家居接觸者，其中一人曾於九月二十五日及二十六日與病人一同到江門市。他們現時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人於潛伏期身處江門市，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得24宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至八月，全球16個國家／地區呈報了約31萬7千宗基孔肯雅熱病例及135宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-02 18:58,2025-10-02 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/02/P2025100200762.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (October 2), one new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

The case involves a 59-year-old male living in Wong Tai Sin District. Preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Jiangmen in Guangdong between September 23 and 26, during which he was bitten by mosquitoes. He developed a fever and joint pain on September 30, followed by a rash yesterday (October 1). He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department at Queen Elizabeth Hospital on October 1 and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. His blood sample tested positive for the Chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. He is now in stable condition.

âThe patient's three household contacts, including one who accompanied the patient to Jiangmen on September 25 and 26, are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since the patient stayed in Jiangmen during his incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 24 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of August, approximately 317 000 CF cases and 135 CF-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
政制及內地事務局局長在立法會政制事務委員會政策簡報會開場發言（只有中文）,2025-10-02 18:35,2025-10-02 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/02/P2025100200724.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞今日（十月二日）在立法會政制事務委員會政策簡報會就《行政長官2025年施政報告》有關政制事務的主要政策措施的開場發言：

主席：

行政長官在今年九月十七日發表本屆政府任內第四份《施政報告》。在今天的會議上，我會向各位議員介紹《施政報告》中與政制事務相關的主要政策措施。

今天除了本局同事外，我們亦邀請了平等機會委員會（平機會）主席、個人資料私隱專員（私隱專員）以及選舉事務處總選舉事務主任一同出席會議。接下來，我會先就本局有關政制方面的政策措施作出簡介，簡介後我們樂意回答各位議員的提問。

特區政府重申，必定會一如既往，全面準確、堅定不移貫徹「一國兩制」、「港人治港」、高度自治的方針，維護《憲法》和《基本法》確立的特區憲制秩序，貫徹落實經完善的選舉制度，全面落實「愛國者治港」原則。這是「一國兩制」行穩致遠，香港特區長治久安的必然要求，任何時候都不能夠動搖。要落實好「愛國者治港」原則，就必須要在制度上提供堅實保障，還需要長期堅持。而守護好我們的管治權，就是守護好香港的和諧穩定，就是守護好香港居民的切身福祉。

公共選舉

在選舉方面，我們會致力確保在新選舉制度下的公共選舉均在公平、公正、誠實和安全有序下順利進行。

在完善特區選舉制度及地區治理體系後，我們已成功舉辦了六場重要的選舉。選舉委員會界別分組補選剛剛在今年九月七日順利舉行。雖然當天遇上颱風，但整體投票和點票過程仍十分暢然有序。新電子點票系統的運作表現符合預期，整體點票工作得以在兩個多小時內有序及高效完成。我們會總結補選的寶貴經驗，繼續與選舉管理委員會（選管會）及選舉事務處以穩中求進的態度，持續優化選舉的各項流程和安排。

年底的立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日舉行，我們正與選管會密鑼緊鼓進行各項相關籌備工作。同時，我們亦會持續推廣經完善選舉制度的優越性和重要性，加強市民對選舉制度的認識及鼓勵他們積極參與。

推展愛國主義教育

在推展愛國主義教育方面，特區政府高度重視在特區傳承和弘揚愛國主義精神，並決心構建以愛國愛港為核心、與「一國兩制」方針相適應的主流價值觀。「愛國主義教育工作小組」自去年四月成立至今已進行大量卓有成效的工作，而其下設的四個分組亦繼續從學校教育、本地社區、歷史政經文化、傳媒宣傳等範疇不斷聚焦探索，研究推出更多切合香港實際情況的愛國主義教育政策措施。

今年是抗戰勝利80周年。特區政府以「銘記歷史、緬懷先烈、珍愛和平、開創未來」為主題，推展一系列的紀念和教育活動，包括由行政長官率領的香港代表團到北京參加九三閱兵、特區政府在香港大會堂紀念花園舉行的官方紀念儀式、行政長官向老戰士頒發由國家授予的紀念章，以及香港歷史博物館和香港抗戰及海防博物館舉辦的大型專題展覽等。

特區政府會繼續梳理及修繕保護全港各區的中共抗戰遺址，以及繼續推廣內地的愛國主義教育設施並將其納入特區愛國主義教育基地，鼓勵更多香港學生和青年到訪，讓他們可以全面認識國家歷史與發展成就。

同時，我們亦會與愛國團體建立密切關係，協同舉辦更多愛國主義教育活動，以善用社會不同界別和愛國團體的資源及網絡，共同推廣愛國主義教育。

加強推廣《憲法》和《基本法》

《憲法》是特區及《基本法》的根和源，與《基本法》共同構建成特區的憲制基礎及秩序。特區政府十分重視《憲法》、《基本法》、國家安全及「一國兩制」的宣傳教育工作，並透過「憲法和基本法推廣督導委員會」積極推進有關工作。

特區政府會繼續以多元渠道和創新手法去加強宣傳教育，包括展示大型戶外宣傳信息、製作宣傳短片、廣泛利用網上平台及社交媒體、舉辦各類深入社區的實體活動、資助非政府組織和民間團體舉辦不同形式的推廣及研究活動，以及結合民間力量向不同群組作出推廣等，以加強市民對《憲法》、《基本法》、國家安全，以及「一國兩制」的認識。

加強與港區全國人大代表及港區全國政協委員交流

港區全國人大代表、港區全國政協委員是國家重要組織成員，是愛國愛港的堅實力量，並肩負參議國事重任，為國家（法治）建設、香港長期繁榮穩定作出重要貢獻。

自二○二三年成立恆常交流機制以來，特區政府得到港區全國人大代表和港區全國政協委員的大力支持，亦收集了他們對特區施政的寶貴意見和建議，而當中不少更被納入行政長官的《施政報告》中。特區政府會繼續促進與各代表和委員的恆常交流，加強溝通協作及交流活動，充分凝聚愛國愛港力量，共建香港美好未來。

保障私隱

為打擊侵犯個人資料私隱的「起底」行為，立法會在二○二一年通過《個人資料（私隱）條例》（《私隱條例》）的修訂，將「起底」列為刑事罪行，並賦予私隱專員刑事調查及檢控權力。私隱公署（個人資料私隱專員公署）一直就相關罪行進行果斷執法。截至上月底，公署已就482宗懷疑「起底」個案展開刑事調查並拘捕77人，當中52人已被檢控及42人被定罪，最長監禁刑期為八個月。

同時，私隱公署亦將人工智能安全及數據安全列為重點宣傳教育工作，並透過頒發「私隱之友嘉許獎」以鼓勵機構實施良好的數據管治，另外亦發布在使用人工智能時應遵循的個人資料保障指引。特區政府會繼續與私隱公署緊密合作，檢視《私隱條例》及擬訂修例建議，以加強個人資料私隱保障及應對網絡新科技所帶來的挑戰。

促進平等機會和消除歧視

我們一直致力促進市民不分種族皆擁有平等機會獲得公共服務，共建關愛共融的社會。我們會繼續支援由政務司司長領導的「少數族裔事務督導委員會」，統籌不同政策措施，為少數族裔市民提供適切服務和支援。

我們亦會繼續支持平機會的工作，適時檢視現行反歧視條例下需要優先關注的範疇，並加強宣傳推廣及公眾教育，以彰顯特區政府加強構建和諧共融社會的決心。

主席，我的介紹完畢。我和同事樂意解答議員的提問。多謝主席。"

"Hong Kong Science Museum's ""Intelligences - Different by Nature"" exhibition to showcase vast spectrum of intelligence across species (with photos)",2025-10-02 18:00,2025-10-02 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/02/P2025100200292.htm,"The annual French scientific culture event, the French Science Festival, will commence tomorrow (October 3). To align with the theme of this year, ""Intelligence(s)"", the Science Promotion Unit of the Hong Kong Science Museum (HKScM) is collaborating with the Consulate General of France in Hong Kong and Macau to launch the ""Intelligences - Different by Nature"" exhibition, which will run until October 29. The exhibition will guide visitors through the vast spectrum of intelligence, beginning with the simplest life forms. It will explore how single-celled organisms adapt and navigate, how plants sense and respond to the environment, and will feature the co-ordination and collective intelligence of insects and the complex behaviours of animals. It also delves into the uniqueness of humanity and the development of AI.

Addressing the opening ceremony today (October 2), the Director of Leisure and Cultural Services, Ms Manda Chan, said that the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and the Consulate General of France in Hong Kong and Macau have a long-standing partnership dedicated to fostering cultural exchanges through major programmes. The French Science Festival, held annually in Hong Kong since 2021, is just one example of these collaborations. This year's French Science Festival offers a timely and inspiring opportunity to reflect on the evolving concept of intelligence and explore different forms of intelligence.

Officiating guests today included the Consul General of France in Hong Kong and Macau, Mrs Christile Drulhe, and the Museum Director of the HKScM, Mr Patrick Lau.

In addition, the exhibition showcases precious animal specimens, such as the Arctic fox, Japanese pipistrelle, golden lion tamarin, bigfin reef squid, as well as intricate insect and bird nests from the Hong Kong Biodiversity Museum. Visitors can closely admire the diverse strategies animals use to survive and their marvellous skills in building elaborate homes. For example, the common tailorbird is known for its unique nest-stitching ability, using its beak as a needle to stitch leaves together with spider silk to create a secure cup-shaped nest for raising its young. Meanwhile, Asian weaver ants use silk produced by their larvae as ""glue"" to bind leaves and construct nests. They rely on chemical and tactile signals to communicate and co-ordinate their complex nest-building activities.

The exhibition also features videos on a termite nest, and a clever horse named Hans, offering further insights into animal intelligence. As well, visitors can assemble a brain puzzle to understand the functions of different areas of the brain. The reading corner in the exhibition gallery offers a selection of books from the Hong Kong Public Libraries, covering topics ranging from animal behaviour and survival wisdom to robotics and AI. Through these resources, members of the public can delve into the fascinating nature and diversity of intelligence.

The HKScM will roll out a series of free programmes. An inaugural conference, Intelligence of the Living - Animal Behaviour will be held on October 3.

Development Bureau imposes regulating action on contractor involved in fatal industrial incident at private development project construction site in Tai Po,2025-10-02 17:48,2025-10-02 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/02/P2025100200697.htm,"   A spokesman for the Development Bureau (DEVB) said today (October 2) that the contractor involved in the fatal industrial incident that happened on September 30 at a private development project construction site in Tai Po was on the List of Approved Contractors for Public Works.

   The DEVB, being the party to procure services for public works, attaches great importance to the site safety performance of all construction sites under the purview of contractors on the List, regardless of whether the sites are public works construction sites or not. The DEVB issued a notification to the contractor concerned today to suspend it from tendering for public works contracts in the site formation category with immediate effect pursuant to the regulating regime. The contractor concerned has to conduct an independent safety audit to review its safety management system. Taking cognisance of the outcome of the independent safety audit, the contractor is required to submit an improvement action plan and implement improvement measures, with a view to demonstrating that it has an effective safety management system before the lifting of the suspension from tendering can be considered. The suspension from tendering is not only confined to tender exercises within the period of suspension from tendering, but is also applicable to tender exercises with procedures initiated but not concluded.

   The Labour Department is investigating this industrial incident and will handle it in accordance with the law. Subject to the investigation findings, the DEVB may impose further regulating actions on the contractor concerned later on, including extension of the period of suspension from tendering for public works contracts and even removal from the List."

商經局向工業貿易諮詢委員會簡介《施政報告》（附圖）,2025-10-02 17:38,2025-10-02 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/02/P2025100200522.htm,"商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺今日（十月二日）在工業貿易諮詢委員會會議上，向委員介紹《行政長官2025年施政報告》中有關推動經貿發展和支援中小企業的主要措施。

丘應樺表示，《施政報告》提出一系列措施，更好發揮香港在「一國兩制」下內聯外通的獨特優勢，積極開拓經濟增長點。其中，為更積極主動協助內地企業「走出去」，政府會整合香港的外地辦事處，包括投資推廣署、香港貿易發展局（貿發局）和香港駐內地的辦事處，組成一站式平台，成立內地企業出海專班，主動招攬內地企業利用香港平台「出海」，為其制訂多元方案，目標是在年底前討論策略及工作計劃，並舉辦首項大型推廣活動。

丘應樺強調，政府致力擴展國際經貿網絡和深化國際交往合作，以鞏固和提升香港的國際貿易中心地位。香港駐吉隆坡經濟貿易辦事處（經貿辦）會在年底前逐步投入運作，政府亦會擴大現有東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）經貿辦的覆蓋範圍，以深化於東盟及周邊亞洲國家的經貿推廣工作，以及計劃擴展經貿辦覆蓋範圍至更多具發展潛力的市場。政府亦會繼續積極推進自由貿易協定及投資協定方面的工作。

丘應樺指，受外圍環境影響，中小企仍然面對不少挑戰，因此《施政報告》繼續加強相關支援。中小企融資擔保計劃下八成擔保產品的申請期將延長兩年，「還息不還本」安排亦再度延長一年。此外，為協助中小企拓展更多元化市場，政府會向「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」注資14.3億元，並擴大資助地域範圍至覆蓋多八個包括「一帶一路」國家在內的經濟體，同時加強宣傳和協助企業透過「申請易」參與展覽會和出口推廣活動。

政府亦會協助中小企拓展跨境電商業務，包括於未來三年在內地和東盟電商市場繼續舉辦「香港好物節」、推行「創意‧電商無限」計劃和提供一站式商業配對及轉介服務。另外，香港出口信用保險局會擴大對本港電商在不同電商平台的融資支援，並進一步擴展免費買家信用調查服務的覆蓋範圍至其承保的所有市場。

丘應樺亦提到政府將設立「經貿一站通」，聯合經貿辦、投資推廣署及貿發局的海外辦事處組成功能平台提升協同效應，組織本地中小企業及初創企業進行海外商務考察以尋找更多商機。

知識產權方面，政府會助力創新型企業利用其知識產權進行融資，完善知識產權貿易生態，包括推出知識產權融資沙盒試點項目、為企業提供專利評估、推出先導計劃資助專利估值，以及在亞洲知識產權營商論壇推廣知識產權融資，並為銀行業界提供知識產權培訓。

此外，丘應樺向委員簡介政府在推動數字貿易發展的工作。在「企業對政府」貿易文件方面，政府正全力開發「貿易單一窗口」第三階段資訊科技系統，並會繼續推進香港與內地單一窗口連接，以及與東盟探討雙方單一窗口的連接。政府亦正參考《電子可轉讓記錄示範法》，研究修訂法例，為「企業對企業」貿易文件電子化提供法律基礎。

丘應樺表示，面對全球貿易格局與地緣政治的複雜多變，上述一系列措施將有助香港持續強化作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的雙角色，積極融入國家發展大局，同時拓展國際新市場和為香港經濟注入新動能，推動經濟高質量發展。"
醫務衞生局副局長在立法會衞生事務委員會會議就強化「全校園健康計劃」的最新進展的開場發言（只有中文）,2025-10-02 17:15,2025-10-02 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/02/P2025100200671.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局副局長范婉雯醫生今日（十月二日）在立法會衞生事務委員會會議就強化「全校園健康計劃」的最新進展的開場發言：

主席、各位委員：

兒童及青少年是社會持續發展的新動力，政府非常重視學童身心健康的發展，致力提供優質的預防疾病及公共醫療服務。我希望藉着今日的會議，向各位簡介政府在促進學童健康方面的工作，特別是強化衞生署「全校園健康計劃」的最新進展。

衞生署促進學生健康服務

衞生署在過去30年一直根據中小學學生在不同成長階段的健康需要，推行健康服務，保障學生生理和心理健康，希望他們在教育體系中得到最大的裨益和充分發展潛能。

相信大家都知道，衞生署每年為全港中小學生提供免費的健康檢查服務，包括生長監測、體格檢查、視力、聽力及脊柱側彎等篩查、有關健康行為和心理社交健康的評估問卷、個人健康輔導、健康教育及一些疫苗補種的服務。我們希望透過周年健康檢查及早識別有健康或行為問題的學童，可以適時介入和為他們提供適切的健康建議，當中包括轉介他們到學生健康服務轄下的健康評估服務，或醫院管理局轄下的專科診所，或其他合適機構接受進一步評估及治理。

「全校園健康計劃」

另一方面，學校是有效及廣泛地推廣健康的一個地方。所以，建構「健康促進學校」能夠讓學生從小掌握健康生活知識及技能。《行政長官2024年施政報告》中宣布強化及擴展「全校園健康計劃」至全港中小學，為每所參與學校編製「一校一健康報告」，希望可以建議促進健康的一些針對性校本措施。

「全校園健康計劃」環繞四大健康主題，包括體能活動、健康飲食、精神健康和社交健康，以及六個「健康促進學校」的發展領域，即包括健康學校政策、學校環境、校風與人際關係、家校與社區聯繫、健康生活技能與實踐，以及學校保健與健康促進服務。衞生署參考世界衞生組織（世衞）所倡議的《健康促進學校框架》，為參與學校提供指引和檢視表，可以協助學校有系統地檢視和制定健康促進措施，希望令學校成為一個有益於生活、學習及工作的「健康促進學校」。

少許數字：截至二○二五年九月十八日，全港共有843所學校，包括379所小學、412所中學和52所特殊學校，已經參加了「全校園健康計劃」，涵蓋超過七成的中小學，這對我們有鼓勵作用。衞生署亦已於二○二五年八月向所有在二○二四／二五學年已參與「全校園健康計劃」的學校（共808所）發放《健康報告》（《學校健康報告與建議》），我們會安排專業團隊向學校深入講解報告的內容，方便學校可以在新學年落實相關的措施。

下一步工作

接下來的工作，政府會繼續與社會各界緊密合作，落實《行政長官2025年施政報告》中提及與學生身心健康相關的各項措施，我們亦會鼓勵全港中小學參與「全校園健康計劃」，幫助學生建立恆常參與體能活動的習慣和健康生活模式，希望最後可以達至世衞的一個願景，就是「讓每一所學校都成為『健康促進學校』」。

結語

主席，今日除了我，亦有衞生署的同事，也有教育局的代表。我們樂意解答各位委員的提問，多謝主席。"

主席：

在《施政報告》中有關運輸及物流數方面，相信多位議員很熟悉及了解。為方便我們稍後的討論，我想重點地提綱挈領用數張投影片，很快地向大家介紹。

運輸基建

在運輸基建方面，我們按照「基建先行、創造容量」的方針，現屆政府運輸及物流局正全力有序推動和落實一系列鐵路、主要幹道和智慧綠色集體運輸系統項目。我們會繼續透過政策和技術「雙創新」，積極推動優化及精簡程序，並汲取其他國內外大型基建發展的經驗，特別是內地及海外經驗，務求提速提效推展各運輸基建項目。大家最近可能在報章或立法會會議中也有討論個別項目，如何利用技術和政策創新作多元化的交通運輸基建建構。我們的目的是希望可以減低成本，同時提高工程質量。

向大家匯報一下，我們正積極推展在東九龍、啟德及洪水橋／厦村及元朗南三個新發展區共三個智慧綠色集體運輸系統項目。創新措施包括三方面，第一，透過公開招標及「公共運輸引導發展」模式鼓勵投資者加入及與營運商夥拍參與。第二，我們將透過立法引入一套技術中立、通用且標準化的全新規管框架，縮短引進新系統的籌備時間之餘，亦可讓政府迅速把握技術突破帶來的機遇。第三，我們正同步簡化建築物管制程序和設立一站式平台，包括路政署及其他相關部門，務必可加快審批流程。啟德智慧綠色集體運輸系統項目預計於本月內招標，東九龍及洪水橋╱厦村新發展區兩個項目則計劃於明年招標。

鐵路方面，正在施工的包括東涌線延綫、小蠔灣站、屯門南延綫、古洞站和洪水橋站，將在二○二七年起陸續完成。我們亦與港鐵公司簽訂了北環綫項目的第一部分項目協議，以新思維，一方面合併北環綫主線和支綫同步推展，爭取在二○三四年或之前同步開通；另一方面，我們亦分階段，成熟一項推一項地簽署項目協議。港深西部鐵路（洪水橋至前海）方面，我們已展開香港段的勘查及設計工作，並邀請了相關承建商及營運商於今個月底前提交意向書，目標是讓項目香港段可以於二○二七年招標。路政署亦正密鑼緊鼓地與相關政府部門以及國內外鐵路專家協作，廣泛吸收包括國家在內的世界級鐵路規範，制訂《香港鐵路標準》，期望新的標準可成為大灣區標準甚至新的世界標準之一，並提供基礎讓香港可善用內地資源建設跨境鐵路項目。

道路基建方面，我們已於今年三月展開北都公路的勘查研究，亦很感謝議員在立法會財務委員會批准，我們現時按計劃完成優化其走線。此外，十一號幹線的勘查研究已大致完成，當中的青龍大橋工程會率先展開，目標是在明年招標。六號幹線餘下的中九龍幹線工程將於月內完成，按照目前進度，我們目標於今年年底，希望可很快正式公布開通中九龍繞道（油麻地段）；而T2主幹路及茶果嶺隧道最後階段的工程正全速推進，目標如期於明年全線通車。

《交通運輸策略性研究》

過往我們在交通事務委員會中吸納各委員，包括主席的意見，會在今年內公布《運輸策略藍圖》，並會就《藍圖》，在立法會交通事務委員會的議程中向大家全面匯報，亦包括最新的看法。《藍圖》將確立三大主題、六大策略，運輸發展將以「落實以人為本、強化內聯外通、促進高效出行、擁抱綠色生活」為願景。政府將進一步逐步落實具體建議，包括進一步提升公共交通服務、新一代運輸交匯樞紐的建設、優化與大灣區其他城市互聯互通、推動自動駕駛車輛發展、強化使用人工智能、更有效運用泊車空間，以及締造單車友善環境等。

推廣自動駕駛車輛

我希望在此特別提及推動自動車，相信很多議員也特別關心。在推動自動車方面，正如《施政報告》提及，我們現時正全速引進和帶動業界在不同社區展開自動車測試與應用，以期邁向全面無人化、規模化，亦希望能達至商業營運，除了可帶動智慧交通外，還可推動業界借香港平台開拓海外尤其是右軚市場。政府會持續以駕駛和路面安全為首要原則，盡快汲取不同經驗優化技術標準，並適時與業界共享研究成果。跨區應用方面，於今年內我們會開始測試及試運行三個項目。第一，在港珠澳大橋口岸與機場島之間的「航天走廊」；第二是橫跨九龍城及觀塘兩區、涵蓋啟德發展區一帶的項目；以及第三是連接機場島與東涌的項目。政府亦會研究接駁其他交通工具的自動車，例如在西九龍高鐵站與機鐵站以自動車試運行李，日後亦希望能載客。除此之外，我們亦會盡量爭取啓動遙距操作模式，即車上沒有後備操作員的測試項目，希望能在後台以系統操控。

「港車北上」、「粵車南下」

接下來我希望說說港珠澳大橋作為雙方奔赴的措施，就是「港車北上」及「粵車南下」。「港車北上」繼續廣受香港市民歡迎，截至今年八月，超過10萬輛香港私家車曾參與，當中不少在運輸署優化系統後申請續牌。粵港政府持續為申請人優化安排，包括上個月起，逢星期二和三，除指定特別日子外，不需作預約要求，以及十月十三日起豁免「港車北上」車輛申請封閉道路通行許可證，我們相信這方面可帶來更大便利

而作為「港車北上」的互惠安排，「粵車南下」政策已於今年七月公布，合資格的廣東私家車可以申請使用港珠澳大橋來港，便利兩地市民互訪，加快雙向奔赴、加快融合：一方面希望能吸引新的旅客群，特別是高端旅客，也便利在粵的家鄉親友和生意夥伴來訪，推動人文交流。最近我與不同的商會、協會，包括酒店業界、飲食界及其他旅遊業界積極溝通，希望在不同方面，各行各業也能集結力量，製作一些宣傳和旅遊攻略。就「粵車南下」，我們也安排了在接下來的交通事務委員會作詳盡介紹。我們現時正爭取在下月、即十一月，同步實施大橋香港口岸的自動化停車場以及入境市區兩個部分，並希望盡快向社會公布細節。

科技應用、人工智能

今年的《施政報告》特別強調應用人工智能，運輸署正已積極利用科技和人工智能及大數據，令牌證服務和交通管理提速提效，同時落實「精明規管」。除了現時運輸署已提供的20多項網上服務之外，運輸署最近又推出了「牌證易」一站式網上平台、電子駕駛執照等。署方已應用人工智能處理網上續領車輛牌照，把無需人手核對的申請的處理時間逐步由過去的10個工作日大大縮短至三個工作日以內。運輸署會繼續於其他更多的牌照服務使用人工智能及科技。

運輸署亦會研究結合大數據分析和人工智能技術，建立一個綜合交通管理平台。其實過去在交通事務委員會亦曾參與，與議員到內地城市了解智慧交通管理平台，我們正正在這方面吸納經驗，希望能全面掌握實時交通情況及管理系統，為未來落實更靈活及智能化的交通管理鋪路。我們將在今年內公布的《運輸策略藍圖》中涵蓋我們如何利用大數據和人工智能，在交通管理、交通工具配套或新的交通運輸樞紐方面如何提供更多信息以便捷市民。

主席，以上簡單以數張投影片，希望重點提及在交通運輸及物流方面的重點政策。我和團隊樂意解答議員的問題。"

零售業公司的分類是採用「香港標準行業分類2.0版」。該行業分類用於各經濟統計調查，把經濟單位撥歸不同的行業類別。

上述零售業銷貨額統計數字量度本地零售業公司銷售貨品的收益，主要是用來評估本地零售業短期的業務表現。零售業銷貨額數據是經由「零售業銷貨額按月統計調查」從本地零售業公司搜集。該統計調查涵蓋不論是否設有實體店的本地零售業公司，而其透過傳統店鋪及網上渠道的銷貨額均包含在零售業銷貨額統計數字內。

零售業銷貨額統計數字包括消費者在貨品方面的開支，但不包括佔消費者整體開支超過50%的服務開支（例如房屋、餐飲、醫療及保健服務、交通及通訊、金融服務、教育及娛樂方面的開支）。此外，數據包括訪港旅客在本港購買貨品方面的開支，但不包括香港居民在境外的開支。因此，數據不應視為量度消費者整體開支的指標。

對消費者整體開支趨勢有興趣的人士，應參考作為按季發表的本地生產總值一個主要組成部分的私人消費開支的數列。根據廣泛資料來源編製的私人消費開支統計數字，涵蓋了香港居民不論在本地或境外在貨品（包括從所有途徑購買的貨品）和服務兩方面的消費開支。有關詳情請參閱政府統計處出版的《按開支組成部分劃分的本地生產總值》。

Provisional statistics of retail sales for August 2025,2025-10-02 16:30,2025-10-02 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/02/P2025100200566.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released the latest figures on retail sales today (October 2).

  The value of total retail sales in August 2025, provisionally estimated at $30.3 billion, increased by 3.8% compared with the same month in 2024.

For the first 8 months of 2025 taken together, it was provisionally estimated that the value of online retail sales increased by 3.0% compared with the same period in 2024.

Commentary

  A government spokesman said that retail sales improved in August. The value of total retail sales grew further by 3.8% over a year earlier, marking the fourth consecutive month of growth.

  Looking ahead, the spokesman said that the stabilising local consumer sentiment, coupled with sustained growth in inbound visitors and the Government's proactive efforts in promoting tourism and mega events, should render support to retail businesses.

Further information

  Table 1 presents the revised figures on value index and value of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet for July 2025 as well as the provisional figures for August 2025. The provisional figures on the value of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet as well as the corresponding year-on-year changes for the first 8 months of 2025 taken together are also shown.

  Table 2 presents the revised figures on value of online retail sales for July 2025 as well as the provisional figures for August 2025. The provisional figures on year-on-year changes for the first 8 months of 2025 taken together are also shown.

  Table 3 presents the revised figures on volume index of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet for July 2025 as well as the provisional figures for August 2025. The provisional figures on year-on-year changes for the first 8 months of 2025 taken together are also shown.

  Table 4 shows the movements of the value and volume of total retail sales in terms of the year-on-year rate of change for a month compared with the same month in the preceding year based on the original series, and in terms of the rate of change for a three-month period compared with the preceding three-month period based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The classification of retail companies follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification (HSIC) Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into different industry classes.

  These retail sales statistics measure the sales receipts in respect of goods sold by local retail companies and are primarily intended for gauging the short-term business performance of the local retail sector. Data on retail sales are collected from local retail companies through the Monthly Survey of Retail Sales (MRS). Local retail companies with and without physical shops are covered in MRS and their sales, both through conventional shops and online channels, are included in the retail sales statistics.

  The retail sales statistics cover consumer spending on goods but not on services (such as those on housing, catering, medical care and health services, transport and communication, financial services, education and entertainment) which account for over 50% of the overall consumer spending. Moreover, they include spending on goods in Hong Kong by visitors but exclude spending outside Hong Kong by Hong Kong residents. Hence they should not be regarded as indicators for measuring overall consumer spending.

  Users interested in the trend of overall consumer spending should refer to the data series of private consumption expenditure (PCE), which is a major component of the Gross Domestic Product published at quarterly intervals. Compiled from a wide range of data sources, PCE covers consumer spending on both goods (including goods purchased from all channels) and services by Hong Kong residents whether locally or abroad. Please refer to the C&SD publication ""Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure Component"" for more details.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey of Retail Sales"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080003&scode=530).

HKMA and HKSTP launch IADS Developer Hackathon to foster bank-fintech collaboration (with photos),2025-10-02 16:30,2025-10-02 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/02/P2025100200377.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP), announced the launch of the IADS Developer Hackathon and held the Kick-off Ceremony today (October 2), marking the beginning of a multi-month innovation journey to foster innovation for the Interbank Account Data Sharing (IADS) initiative, and transform banking services through secure, customer-consented data sharing.

The IADS Developer Hackathon, organised by the HKSTP, runs from October 2025 to March 2026. It brings together the banking industry and fintech firms from around the world to collaborate and create innovative, secure, customer-consented solutions, leveraging the IADS to drive digital transformation in Hong Kong's banking sector. Participants will develop innovative use cases for retail, corporate and small and medium-sized enterprises customer segments, with mentorship provided by banking professionals. Finalists will be invited to showcase their solutions at the IADS Developer Conference in March 2026, and winning teams may also have the opportunity to access business expansion support, investor engagement platforms, brand exposure, and future pitching opportunities through HKSTP, and other partner organisations, to promote the market and development of their solutions.

The IADS initiative is formulated by the HKMA and launched with the support of the banking industry. The IADS initiative has established rules and standards that facilitate interbank customer-consented data sharing. This enables customers to securely and efficiently share their bank account data from one participating bank to other participating banks, subject to customer consent. Account data sharing can help digitalise banking operations, strengthen risk management of banks, and enhance customer experience.

According to Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure) of the HKMA, Mr Nelson Chow,""The IADS Developer Hackathon represents an exciting opportunity for the financial and technology sectors to converge and drive innovation in IADS. We look forward to this event uncovering novel solutions that will benefit both the industry and the community.""

  Acting Chief Corporate Development Officer of the HKSTP,Mr Eric Or,said, ""The IADS Developer Hackathon embodies the spirit of innovation and collaboration that HKSTP strives to foster. It will help catalyse innovation, providing valuable opportunities for startups to exchange and collaborate with the industry, and propelling Hong Kong's position as a hub for financial technology and innovation.""
