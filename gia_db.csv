年宵市場於開放前三日（二○二六年二月八至十日）供獲許可人搭建攤位。若出現無法預料的情況，導致整段特許期（包括搭建攤位和年宵營業時間）縮短，政府有權延遲開始日期和縮短特許期，食環署會把出租價格（使用費）按剩餘日期比例無息退還予攤位獲許可人。

攤位獲許可人須在二月十七日上午七時前（維多利亞公園年宵市場則於上午九時前），把整個檔架及一切營業工具移離准用範圍，並清理所有垃圾、廢屑和未售出的商品（不論損毀與否）。

攤位獲許可人亦須明確同意，不會在准用範圍及附近地方銷毀、毀爛或棄置任何未售出的商品。他們可以在二月十七日上午七時前（維多利亞公園年宵市場則於上午九時前）自願將未售出的花卉及盆栽即場送交食環署處置，惟食環署不會支付任何費用或作出任何形式的賠償。

Applicants must be at least 18 years old and ordinarily reside in Hong Kong. Each applicant may select only one stall at a time. Successful applicants shall comply with all the stipulations and provisions as set out in the licence agreement. An FEHD spokesman stressed that the public should not assign, sublet, transfer or otherwise part with any of the benefits or obligations of the licence agreement of the LNY fair stalls. Otherwise, the department is entitled to terminate the agreement and the licensee shall immediately vacate the stall.

All fair sites will be made available to the licensees three days in advance of the fairs (from February 8 to 10, 2026) for the setting up of stalls. In the event of any unforeseeable incident that will cause a shortening of the whole licence period (including the duration for setting up stalls and the business period of the fair), the Government has the right to postpone the commencement date and shorten the duration of the period. The let out price (licence fee) paid will be refunded to the licensee on a pro-rata basis without interest.

Stall licensees must completely remove the stall structure and all paraphernalia, together with all refuse, debris and unsold commodities (whether damaged or otherwise), from the licensed area before 7am on February 17, 2026 (9am for the Victoria Park LNY Fair).

The FEHD reminded licensees that the stalls are solely for the purpose of selling and promoting the sale of the permitted commodities, and no other activities are allowed in the licensed area. If the FEHD considers that any activity conducted by the licensee to publicise, promote, display, show or sell any permitted commodities in the venue is unlawful, contrary to the interest of national security, immoral or incompatible with the object of the LNY fair, the FEHD is entitled to direct the licensee to stop conducting such activities and the licensee must immediately comply with the direction.

Stall licensees should not destroy, damage or abandon any unsold commodities at or in the vicinity of the stall.They may surrender unsold flowers and plants left behind at the stall to the FEHD at no charge, cost or compensation whatsoever, before 7am on February 17, 2026 (9am for the Victoria Park LNY Fair).

According to the licence agreement, except inside designated stalls, licensees must not keep, store or use any compressed helium cylinder in the licensed area. Whereas licensees of the designated stalls may keep, store or use helium cylinders in the licensed area, the quantity of helium should be such that a licence is not required pursuant to the Dangerous Goods (Application and Exemption) Regulation 2012 (Cap. 295E), i.e. equivalent to 150 litres of helium. Sales of floatable LED glowing balloons and aquarium fish by stall licensees are prohibited at the LNY fairs.

In addition, as stated in the licence agreement, the height of dry goods stalls must not exceed 3 metres from ground level. The height of wet goods stalls and fast food stalls must not exceed 4.5m from ground level. For wet goods stalls and fast food stalls with a height of more than 3m from ground level, the licensee must, at their own costs, provide the FEHD with the original certificate issued by an authorised person, a registered structural engineer, or a competent person under the Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations (Cap. 59I) to certify the structural safety of the structure in the licensed area before the fair is opened to the public. The licensee must also affix a copy of the aforesaid certificate on the structure of the stall. Also, each corner and anchor point of the marquee (if any) shall be securely fastened using appropriate ballast weights, such as sandbags or purpose-designed marquee water weights. During the period when the Strong Monsoon Signal is in force or to be issued, the licensee shall immediately inspect the stall and adopt reinforcement measures as necessary.

Public notices and details of the renting of 2026 LNY fair remaining stalls on a first-come, first-served basis are available atthe FEHD website (www.fehd.gov.hk) or by calling the FEHD hotline at 2868 0000."
​香港海關搗破三個懷疑私煙銷售點（附圖）,2025-11-19 19:00,2025-11-19 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900632.htm,"香港海關今日（十一月十九日）採取反私煙執法行動，搗破三個懷疑私煙銷售點，包括兩個位於葵芳及荃灣的報攤及一個位於荃灣的士多，檢獲共約三千八百支懷疑私煙，估計市值約一萬七千元，應課稅值約一萬三千元，並拘捕三人。

根據新修訂的《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），任何售價低於煙草稅的香煙必須證明已課稅，否則將被推定為未完稅香煙。在新修訂的《條例》生效後，海關亦加強執法，打擊私煙銷售點，並密切留意市場情況，在全港各區巡查。

而海關近日發現仍有部分香煙銷售點以低於煙草稅的價格出售香煙，遂於今日採取執法行動，在上述的報攤和士多檢獲共約三千八百支懷疑私煙，拘捕兩名女子和一名男子，包括兩名店主及一名售貨員，年齡介乎五十二至六十五歲。

海關呼籲各零售商切勿售賣來歷不明的香煙，對來貨價低於煙草稅的香煙，必須提高警覺，以避免刑事責任。

海關提醒零售商和市民，根據《條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Hong Kong Customs raids three suspected illicit cigarette sales outlets (with photos),2025-11-19 19:00,2025-11-19 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900634.htm,"  Hong Kong Customs mounted an anti-illicit cigarette enforcement operation today (November 19) and raided three suspected illicit cigarette sales outlets, including two newsstands in Kwai Fong and Tsuen Wan, as well as one store in Tsuen Wan, seizing a total of about 3 800 suspected illicit cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $17,000 and a duty potential of about $13,000. Three persons were arrested.

  According to the amended Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO), cigarettes sold at a price lower than the tobacco duty must be proven to be duty-paid, otherwise the cigarettes are presumed to be duty-not-paid. After the amended DCO took effect, Customs has also strengthened enforcement actions to combat illegal cigarette sales outlets, and has been closely monitoring the market situation and stepping up patrols in various districts.

  Noting that there were still cigarette sales outlets selling cigarettes at a price lower than the tobacco duty, Customs officers took enforcement actions today and seized about 3 800 suspected illicit cigarettes in the abovementioned newsstands and store. Two women and one man, comprising two newsstand owners and one employee, aged between 52 and 65 were arrested.

  Customs appeals to retailers not to sell cigarettes of unknown sources. They must stay vigilant against cigarettes with a wholesale price lower than the tobacco duty in order to avoid criminal liability.

  Customs reminds retailers and members of the public that under the DCO, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.
â
  Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Government launches Green Maritime Fuel Development Communication Platform,2025-11-19 18:48,2025-11-19 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900627.htm,"The Government announced today (November 19) the establishment of the Green Maritime Fuel Development Communication Platform to catalyse the development of a green maritime fuel bunkering supply chain in Hong Kong through communication and collaboration among industry stakeholders, with the goal of developing Hong Kong into a green maritime fuel bunkering and trading centre.

The Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB) promulgated the Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering last November, outlining five strategies and 10 actions to develop Hong Kong into a centre for green maritime fuel bunkering. Among the measures in the Action Plan is the establishment of a collaborative platform for the industry to support the development of effective supply chains and trading channels. The newly launched Communication Platform is a major initiative to foster industry collaboration, bringing together upstream and downstream companies within the green maritime fuel bunkering supply chain, including fuel suppliers, shipping companies, and port operators, among others. In addition to gathering views from Communication Platform members regarding the development of green maritime fuel bunkering and trading in Hong Kong, the Government will organise networking activities and government-facilitated business meetings to enhance stakeholder communication and co-operation, thereby expediting the establishment of a complete and resilient green maritime fuel bunkering supply chain in Hong Kong.

The Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, said at today's International Bunker Industry Association Annual Convention, ""The Communication Platform aims to facilitate business discussion and collect views from the trade on ways to bolster our competitiveness in green maritime fuel bunkering and trading. We warmly welcome all interested Hong Kong companies, as well as Mainland and foreign companies with a presence in Hong Kong, to join the Communication Platform and develop Hong Kong into a premier green maritime fuel bunkering and trading centre together.""

Currently, 25 companies and industry organisations have joined the Communication Platform. The TLB encourages more companies and industry organisations involved in green maritime fuel bunkering to join and explore business opportunities together. Details about the Communication Platform and application forms can be obtained from the TLB website:www.tlb.gov.hk/eng/boards/transport/maritime/gmfdlg.html."

A 30-year-old male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, via Jakarta, Indonesia, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds in his check-in baggage. The man was subsequently arrested.

The arrested man has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, and he will appear at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (November 20).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

運輸及物流局於去年十一月公布《綠色船用燃料加注行動綱領》，訂定五大策略及十項行動，目標把香港發展成為綠色船用燃料加注中心。其中，《行動綱領》提出為業界提供合作平台，以協助建立有效的供應鏈和交易渠道。新成立的交流平台正是促進業界合作的重要舉措。交流平台匯聚綠色船用燃料加注供應鏈的上、下游企業，包括燃料供應商、航運企業及港口營運商等。政府除了會聽取交流平台的企業對在香港發展綠色船用燃料加注和交易業務的意見，亦會透過舉辦不同的交流活動和由政府促成的業務會議等，促進相關持份者的溝通協作，以加快在香港建立完整和具韌性的綠色船用燃料加注供應鏈。

運輸及物流局局長陳美寶在今日的國際燃料工業協會年會上表示：「交流平台旨在促進業界討論，收集意見，以提升香港在綠色船用燃料加注和交易方面的競爭力。我們歡迎所有有興趣的香港公司，以及在香港開展業務的內地和海外公司加入交流平台，共同將香港打造成區內首屈一指的綠色船用燃料加注和交易中心。」

目前已有25間企業和行業組織加入交流平台。運輸及物流局歡迎更多參與綠色船用燃料加注業務的企業和行業組織加入交流平台，探索更多商機。交流平台詳情及申請表格可在運輸及物流局的網站索取：www.tlb.gov.hk/tc/boards/transport/maritime/gmfdlg.html。"
連續兩日錄得兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-11-19 18:32,2025-11-19 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900619.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月十九日）接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案，再次敦促學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的12歲男童。他於十一月十五日因其他自身疾病到基督教聯合醫院求醫，需留院治理，於十一月十八日出現發燒及咳嗽。他的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發休克，目前在兒童深切治療部留醫，情況嚴重。

男童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗，近期不曾外遊。他的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵，他就讀的學校近日亦沒有爆發流感。

計及上述個案，今個夏季流感季節至今已錄得20宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括兩宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎11個月至17歲。若單單計算在本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃展開後錄得的11宗個案，只有一人曾在發病前四天接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。然而接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，換言之，這些嚴重個案的兒童都未能受到疫苗保護。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然最新的監測數據顯示，流感活躍程度在十月最後一周開始回落，但仍然處於較高水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除流感活躍程度仍可能會有反覆，加上明年初或會出現冬季流感季節，因此我再次呼籲所有年滿6個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動。對比今年初冬季流感季節，今季兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案較多。目前，18歲以下兒童中，6個月至2歲以下兒童的覆蓋率相對偏低，只有近16%，希望各位家長不要遲疑，請盡快聯絡自己家庭醫生為子女，以至自己和其他家人安排接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

The meeting co-ordinated various departments in formulating specific implementation measures on issues of local concern and continuously reviewed the work progress and performance.

 Mr Cheuk said, ""With the concerted efforts of all departments, various measures have been steadily implemented in accordance with the overall strategies set by the Steering Committee, effectively improving environmental hygiene, enhancing community development, and strengthening district services. The Task Force will continue to co-ordinate departments in stepping up the speed and efficiency in addressing a range of pressing district concerns, continuously improving people's livelihood and well-being.""

 The Steering Committee chaired by the Chief Secretary for Administration has formulated strategies for 12 district issues (Note), including various measures to strengthen community support. These initiatives actively address the needs of the public and seek to enhance their quality of life and satisfaction. At the meeting, the Task Force followed up on the implementation progress and outcomes of relevant initiatives. These include: 200 primary schools have participated in the School-based After School Care Service Scheme, providing a total of about 10 600 service places; the Government has launched the first phase of the Carer Support Data Platform, which integrates the data of the Housing Department and the Social Welfare Department to identify high-risk cases with relatively limited community support, with Care Teams having visited or reached out to over 18 000 singleton and doubleton elderly households, carers of elderly persons and persons with disabilities and referred more than 900 cases to social welfare service units as of end-October; the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has taken enforcement actions against shopfront extension under the Public Health and Municipal Services (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 to safeguard environmental hygiene; as of September 30, the FEHD has issued over 7 000 ""Statutory Nuisance Notices"" in response to environmental nuisances caused by air-conditioner water dripping, with the vast majority of cases already rectified; and relevant departments continue to improve the waiting environment at public transport interchanges, including the ventilation system and lighting.

 Mr Cheuk thanked all departments for their dedicated efforts in advancing the above work and achieving notable results. He urged all departments to uphold the spirit of unity and pragmatism and to continue actively following up on various livelihood-related issues, effectively enhancing the quality of life and well-being of the public.

The Government is making full preparations for the Legislative Council General Election to be held on December 7. As an important election following the enhancement of the district governance system, it carries significant implications for Hong Kong's community development, economic growth and people's livelihood. Mr Cheuk directed heads of departments to put in place comprehensive arrangements and ensure close co-ordination, carrying out all related tasks in a thorough, detailed and pragmatic manner. He requested all departments to provide practicable facilitation measures to support staff in voting and to make good use of government district facilities and networks to widely disseminate messages encouraging voter turnout. These efforts will help deepen public understanding of the election and the importance of voting, motivating citizens to cast their ballots and elect capable and committed Members of the Legislative Council who will contribute to community development and Hong Kong's prosperity and progress.

Note: The 12 key issues are: (1) expanding after-school care and enhancing support for parents; (2) caring for the elderly and enhancing community support; (3) fostering clean markets and mobilising the community to participate in anti-rodent work; (4) enhancing public order and combating crimes on all fronts; (5) improving pedestrian facilities and ensuring road safety; (6) enhancing the community environment and strengthening local characteristics ; (7) improving the environment of public housing estates and creating comfortable homes; (8) caring for the elderly and promoting digital inclusion; (9) improving the waiting environment at public transport interchanges to enhance the travel experience; (10) combating air-conditioner water dripping to improve community environment; (11) cleaning pedestrian walkways to improve city streets; (12) strengthening thematic planting."

  A 55-year-old incoming male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on November 18. During customs clearance, Customs officers seized about 10 800 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $44,000 and a duty potential of about $36,000, from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

  Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

  Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Speech by STL at Greater Bay Maritime Forum 2025 (with photo),2025-11-19 17:58,2025-11-19 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900552.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the Greater Bay Maritime Forum 2025 today (November 19):

Ladies and gentlemen,

I am delighted to join you this morning at the Greater Bay Maritime Forum 2025. Today's forum serves as an excellent platform for us to exchange ideas and insights regarding the advancement of the maritime sector, particularly in providing the vast opportunities presented by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) development.

The Recommendations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, revealed just last month, reaffirmed the Central Government's full support for Hong Kong's efforts in enhancing our status as an international maritime centre. More specifically, the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area supports enhancing the overall international competitiveness of the Pearl River Delta port cluster and emphasises the importance of a complementary and mutually beneficial port system to foster synergy.

The theme of today's forum is ""Internal Integration and External Connectivity for Multiple Wins"". I think there is indeed no better place to delve into this topic than here in Hong Kong.

Building upon Hong Kong's unique advantages, we have been and will continue to be the maritime ""super-connector"" within the GBA region. Our strategy has been to leverage our competitive advantages as a free port - renowned for its efficiency, strong connectivity and the strategic development of Hong Kong and contribution to the GBA, as well as, most important of all, our position as the two-way springboard connecting the Chinese Mainland and the rest of the world.

As outlined in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address in September, the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government is set to implement a series of new measures to propel our maritime sector forward. One key measure involves actively establishing a comprehensive ""rail-sea-land-river"" intermodal transport system by promoting intermodal cargo transport with the Chinese Mainland's inland provinces, such as Chongqing, Guangxi, and perhaps Jiangxi, Hunan and Yunnan. All these provinces on the Mainland have an abundant supply of raw materials as well as cargo products that we have longed for. These resource-rich provinces can fully leverage Hong Kong's global connectivity network to flexibly transfer goods worldwide, while simultaneously attracting more cargo sources to Hong Kong and improving its appeal as a hub for cargo consolidation and transshipment, thus creating a win-win situation.

To further strengthen regional collaboration and global connections, we are actively pursuing to establish an international ""partner port"" network by building strategic partnerships with ports on the Chinese Mainland and in the Belt and Road countries. I am happy to share with you - and perhaps I need not stress this because you should have got all the information through the press over the past few days - that we have just signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with the San Antonio Port of Chile, as well as Guangxi and Dalian on the Chinese Mainland, as our first batch of ""partner ports"". By strengthening the port connections with our overseas and Chinese Mainland port partners, it will not only allow us to foster new collaboration, exchange best practices, and improve trade and logistics efficiency, but also help solidify Hong Kong's position as a premier international shipping centre right in the GBA region, thereby enhancing the overall competitiveness of the region. I can assure you, Hong Kong is not just looking for benefits for ourselves; I think our growth and competitiveness are intertwined with the growth and competitiveness of all the ports, neighbouring cities, and airports in the rest of the GBA area. We should synergise and foster collaboration in order to help ourselves grow even stronger. We are therefore keen to further collaboration with other ports in the GBA as well.

Following the success of the Mainland-Hong Kong Green Energy Matchmaking Event, which was organised between Hong Kong and the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China just in June this year, which was very attractive and successful and attended by over 300 representatives from local, overseas and Chinese Mainland companies all involved in the green energy business, we advanced our collaboration efforts by launching the Green Maritime Fuel Development Communication Platform that will soon be promulgated in the coming days, so as to connect industry players across the entire green maritime fuel supply chain. We look forward to business deals catalysed by the platform, thereby expediting the establishment of a green maritime fuel business ecosystem that will underpin our prominence in the green shipping era.

In addition, we are stepping up efforts to promote smart port operations and data interconnection among the maritime and port industry through a digitalised Port Community System, PCS, which will be officially launched early next year. But we couldn't wait - notwithstanding the official launch to be held early next year, we are already connecting with different suppliers, stakeholders in the supply chain of logistics and shipping, and, more importantly, we are also collaborating with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on a Project CargoË£ scheme in order to help all our enterprises, whether they are small, medium, or big, ride on and leverage this digitalised port system for trade finance and also blockchain to trace the cargo for more efficient cargo operation and even custom clearance in a more seamless way.

This digital collaborative platform will provide cargo tracking functions and connect sea, land and air transport networks, enhancing cross-sector information interconnectivity and increasing the Hong Kong Port's efficiency and overall competitiveness. We signed an MOU with the Guangdong e-Port in May 2025, which facilitates system and data connectivity to provide the ""One-Data-Multiple-Declarations"" function for cross-border logistics and offer pre-filling and pre-submission of shipping manifests for vessels entering the GBA region. We will continue to expand the functionalities of the PCS and explore enhancing co-operation with other Chinese Mainland ports. Actually, on Monday's (November 17) ALMAC (Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference) VIP luncheon, we witnessed a B2B (business-to-business) MOU signing between our two port operators with the Guangxi Beibu Gulf International Port Group Company Limited, and that also leveraged our digitalised data sharing system and clearance for customs.

Today, I would also like to express my warmest congratulations to the Maritime Talent Cultivation Alliance on its establishment. Uniting 16 renowned academics and maritime associations, the establishment of the Alliance marks a significant step in maritime talent development by bridging the industry, academia, research, and investment sectors, fostering the sustainable growth of the industry. I really look forward to the Alliance achieving remarkable progress and discovering new avenues for growth in Hong Kong.

Ladies and gentlemen, the initiatives I just highlighted are not stand-alone efforts; they represent the direct and active implementation of Hong Kong's commitment to consolidating and enhancing our status as an international maritime centre. As you can see from the past 24 months - or perhaps 12 months - the energy and drive demonstrated by the Hong Kong SAR Government, in particular my bureau and also the Marine Department, is evident. This is not happening in isolation. It is an act of strong determination and strong drive with the support and strong backing of the maritime and shipping industry, including the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, the maritime industry, and long-established shipping tycoons in Hong Kong, whom we also treasure.

I believe that through our close partnership with the Chinese Mainland, we will continue to contribute to the strategic development framework of our country. While the global maritime industry continues to experience its ebb and flow, I am confident that by working together, we in this region, with the Chinese Mainland as our strong backup, we can not only ride the tide but also chart the course ahead. My congratulations, once again, on the inauguration of the Maritime Talent Cultivation Alliance, and I wish you all a very successful and fruitful forum. I look forward to seeing you all at this forum next year. Thank you very much.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-19 17:37,2025-11-19 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900575.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月十九日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得64宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。就早前公布一宗涉及一名住在筲箕灣東熹苑的68歲女子的本地個案，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處已完成對該名病人的病毒基因分析工作。結果顯示，她的病毒樣本基因序列，與其他本港錄得的基孔肯雅熱輸入個案及三宗分別在黃大仙及青衣居住的本地感染個案不一樣，顯示他們的感染源頭不同。中心不排除在該名病人活動的地區內，早前有未確診的患者將病毒傳播給蚊子，導致她受感染。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應上述的本地個案，中心呼籲該名患者居所一帶居民，如於十月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員和東區關愛隊已向東熹苑一帶受影響地區約3 000個單位派發有關預防基孔肯雅熱的資料單張及問卷，提醒居民留意有否相關病徵和注意家居的環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過設於筲箕灣興東商場二樓的醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於東熹苑進行上門探訪，為逾4 950名市民進行評估，過去四日未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。中心已為四名早前出現輕微病徵的市民進行抽血檢查，全部對基孔肯雅病毒的檢測為陰性。醫護站的運作時間會因應實際需要而調整，確實時間請參閱中心網站。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-19 17:37,2025-11-19 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900576.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 19),no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 64 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases. Regarding the recently announced local case involving a 68-year-old female who lives in Tung Hei Court in Shau Kei Wan,the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch has completed genome analysis of the patient. The result indicated that the genetic sequence of her viral sample differed from those of other imported CF cases recorded in Hong Kong and the three local CF cases in Wong Tai Sin and Tsing Yi, suggesting separate sources of infection. The CHP cannot rule out the possibility that an earlier, undiagnosed patient in an area visited by the patient transmitted the virus to mosquitoes, which then infected her.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

In light of the above local case, the CHP urged the residents living in the vicinity of the patient's residence to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 15. The CHP collaborated with the Eastern District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention and questionnaire surveys to about 3 000 households in the affected areas in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

  As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 4 950 individuals through the health consultation booth on 2/F, Hing Tung Shopping Centre in Shau Kei Wan, its inquiry hotline (2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits at Tung Hei Court. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past four days. Four individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests, and all testednegative for the chikungunya virus. The operating hours of the booth will be adjusted based on actual needs. Please refer to the CHP'swebpagefor the actual operating hours of the health consultation booth.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Speech by STL at International Bunker Industry Association Annual Convention 2025 (English only) (with photo),2025-11-19 13:21,2025-11-19 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900339.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA) Annual Convention 2025 today (November 19):

Constantinos (Chair of the IBIA and Bunker Director at the Star Bulk Carriers, Mr Constantinos Capetanakis), Alexander (Executive Director of the IBIA, Mr Alexander Prokopakis), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, and many friends, old and new,

  Welcome again to Hong Kong. Today is getting a little bit cold and I know that every one of you has made an effort to arrive here to make it for this forum. I can assure you that with the Chair's remarks, you would have a lot of takeaways from this forum this morning. It is actually a distinct honour for Hong Kong to host the IBIA's premier flagship event here for the very first time. Judging from what Constantinos just said, I think Hong Kong and the IBIA share a lot of the same vision. I truly agree with the particular phrase you mentioned that we need leadership and we need action and solutions, rather than just rules or discussions inside closed doors, we need to go to the ground. We also need to lead everybody for a joint solution towards the green transformation.

  The IBIA's decision to host this event in Hong Kong is absolutely spot on. As you all know, we're renowned for our highly efficient, professional and smart port services, consistently ranking us among the world's top international maritime centres. This is complemented by our thriving bunkering activities, which put us seventh in the world, second in our country and first in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. We haven't said so in the past, but as we move on from conventional fuel to greener fuel for shipping vessels, we dig out our figures and records. It seems that it is not just that we have been doing good and ranking high in terms of cargo throughput, but we have also been making use of our pivotal position to provide fuel for ocean-going vessels over the decades. Therefore, it seems more than suitable to discuss the latest developments in bunkering in the busiest bunkering hub and the most happening port in the region. So I can assure you, Alexander, you have chosen the right place to host this forum since your visit last year.

  Our strength in bunkering is no coincidence: Hong Kong is strategically located at the southernmost tip of southern China right next to international fairways, making it a perfect place for ships to refuel. And now, as the entire marine community is pivoting to decarbonisation, a great opportunity lies right ahead of us. By leveraging this strategic position, Hong Kong is poised to develop into a leading centre for green maritime fuel bunkering as well as trading - ensuring we continue to meet the industry's evolving needs for top-notch, sustainable bunkering services. In fact, to support the International Maritime Organization (IMO)'s vision of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from international shipping by or around 2050, the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government took action quickly, and we are determined to do so, notwithstanding the hiccups recently on the schedule of the IMO. Exactly one year ago, we laid out a clear pathway and roadmap for our port in the Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering promulgated. 

  The thinking behind our Action Plan is very simple: we need to offer the industry a clear direction on green maritime fuel adoption, supported by policies that can turn our shared vision for a green maritime fuel bunkering and trading centre into reality. That's why we've set out in the Action Plan five main strategies - Green Fuel, Green Port, Green Incentives, Green Collaboration and Green Talents. We have 10 specific measures underpinning these five strategies.

  Starting with Green Fuels, we make clear that Hong Kong will adopt a multi-fuel strategy, with the most commonly used or explored fuels such as LNG (liqified natural gas), biodiesel, methanol, ammonia and hydrogen being the fuels of choice. We then set out to build up a supply chain of such fuels in Hong Kong, from locating sources of green fuels in the proximity, that is the Chinese Mainland, which is conveniently right next to us and have been the largest supplier of such fuels by far, to developing storage facilities and providing bunkering infrastructure in Hong Kong. We are small, but I think we will be targeted and focused in providing, putting and rolling out storage facilities, infrastructure support, so as to allow Hong Kong to provide a miniature of the ecosystem that is advocated under the IBIA. Crucially, this strategy is already backed by concrete regulatory actions. Just to name a few, we have passed the enabling legislation, published technical requirements and guidelines, and approved a duty exemption for methanol bunkering. In the old days, there used to be some industry using the methanol for making wine. And that is not good for health. That is why we have updated legislation on charging duty on methanol. It might have just looked like a simple piece of legislation; we went around the government administration, particularly the health authorities, the doctors and the medical practitioners. While we respect their professionalism, it took us some time to convince them that we are now looking for bunkering only, for our outward-looking ships and not winemaking. While we have already amended our law, we promised that we will input, inject some of the tightened safeguarding measures, from the customs point of view, to make sure that there will be no abuse of this tax exemption. But this is a right signal that we have expedited, and we hope to see the first-ever methanol bunkering operation soon in Hong Kong.

  These are the precise policy measures, and legislative and supporting measures that we promised. We are designed to make green maritime fuel bunkering a practical and competitive reality. One year on, we have indeed come a long way, with commercial LNG and biodiesel bunkering services now available in Hong Kong and nearly 200 000 tonnes of green maritime fuels bunkered to date in Hong Kong. Still a lot of our industry players are not aware that Hong Kong has been treated to that point. They think that we are still at the initiation stage, still at the drafting stage. But I need to publicise more and talk more that we are actually actionable. We put things into operation, and it's not just for pilots, but it was for commercial operation. The first methanol bunkering operation, as I just mentioned, will also happen before long, while we will start looking into ammonia and hydrogen bunkering and hope to tell the market where we stand on it soon.

  We fully recognise that the maritime industry is global by nature. I also mentioned and discussed at the ICS (International Chamber of Shipping) summit, we do not treat Hong Kong-based shipping companies as local companies. We treat them all along as global companies. We are globally based. We need to take their concerns and anxieties, arising from all the geopolitical circumstances, dear to our hearts. We have to listen, facilitate and help them to resolve and to take solutions. A truly green transition can't happen in isolation; it demands collaboration between ports available worldwide. First, we have been supporting our port operators in their effort to reduce carbon emissions and create a greener port. But just as importantly, we are looking outward, we are actively identifying ports with which to establish green shipping corridors. I would like to learn more from the IBIA, because from your base worldwide, I already know that there are a few existing green shipping corridors in operation, and there are a few being planned. I very much hope that Hong Kong will be able to participate in some of those, if not all. If Hong Kong can lead discussions on creating a new ones, perhaps in this part of the region, we can actively participate and contribute. For the very first step, we have also announced the signing of the first batch of partner ports. This paved our way to put Hong Kong in a more high-profile position, so that we can attract more sisters and brothers to build a greater alliance. This initiative will definitely drive us to upgrade our infrastructure and enhance green maritime fuel bunkering capabilities, with the ultimate goal of creating truly net-zero emission shipping lanes. We will have some exciting updates on this front next year, particularly on our move towards creating or joining the green shipping corridors. It is not just an upward or a high profile publicising move, but actually I would like to use this to drive inward, back home. The effort towards building a green port is very important to push our ship operators or container terminal operators to invest and expedite their action. The IBIA Secretariat will know that there needs to be a lot of participation and influence, especially on the operators because they have to really invest billions and trillions of money. They will need to know the long-term future and long-term bright spot on that. But in the meantime, they will definitely need to make some tough decisions right in the short term for investments. With Hong Kong putting our footprint on the worldwide green transformation path, I would like to use this as a triggering point to enable our operators and industry players to join, participate and act.

  Closer to home, we are forging partnerships with stakeholders from both Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland. I think one of the points that the IBIA comes to Hong Kong is that you would like to run Hong Kong as a platform and you can get more knowledge about what is happening in the Chinese Mainland. In particular, we have set up some platforms and communication channels to focus squarely on fuel supply and trading with the Chinese Mainland. A powerful example of this collaboration was this June, when we signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with four green maritime fuel suppliers and bunker operators. This took place at a groundbreaking event - the first ever Mainland-Hong Kong green energy business matchmaking event organised under the auspices of the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government. It is actually motivated and rooted between the Ministry of Commerce and my bureau. We hosted that matchmaking event in a dual mode. It was hosted both in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. We witnessed the signing of the MOU online and in parallel mode, thanks to all the digital technological backup. With over 300 industry representatives participating, the event was a clear sign of our shared commitment to building a thriving ecosystem for maritime fuel bunkering and trading. But we didn't stop there, we established a communication platform that encompasses companies registered and doing business in Hong Kong from across the entire maritime fuel bunkering supply chain, with a view to facilitating business discussion and collecting views from the trade on ways to bolster our competitiveness in green maritime fuel bunkering and trading. We warmly welcome all interested Hong Kong companies to join the communication platform. For all those from abroad, we welcome you to have branches or headquarters in Hong Kong, and we also welcome them to join this communication platform which we will be announcing soon, so stay tuned. Together, we can firmly put Hong Kong on the map as a premier green maritime fuel bunkering hub in the region, as well as a green maritime fuel trading centre that acts as the gateway for export and trading of Mainland-produced green maritime fuels.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the transition towards green maritime fuels is an irreversible trend for the maritime industry and this is what we have mentioned. This isn't a choice or an option; it's an imperative. And Hong Kong is all in. To navigate this change, we need forums like this. The IBIA has the right decision to have this spot right in this year's Hong Kong Maritime Week. I am sure you have helped drive some of our 18 000-plus participants this year, which is a record high. Today is about preparing for that future. The conversations in this room will equip us with the crucial steps we need very much to take, together and ahead. My thank to the IBIA for bringing us all together today, I encourage all participants this morning to make best of this event, learn more about the opportunities here in Hong Kong and also worldwide in different countries, different ports. We are all very passionate, notwithstanding the International Maritime Organization's agenda, and we hope that we can explore how we, together, can be a part of that exciting green journey.

  I wish you all a very fruitful event and a pleasant stay in Hong Kong. Thank you very much."

 The 10-kilometre race will start at the Tseung Lam Highway near Tong Yin Street and route through the Tseung Lam Highway, Cha Kwo Ling Road, Kwun Tong Bypass and Hoi Bun Road to the finishing point at Kwun Tong Promenade.

 Subject to the race arrangements and progress, the road sections along the race routes will be temporarily closed in phases from 1am on that day, until the reopening of roads at about 1pm. Motorists are advised to pay attention to the traffic signs erected at the scene and consider using alternative routes to their destinations.

 Due to the temporary road closures, the TD anticipates that traffic at various locations on Hong Kong Island and in Kowloon and the New Territories will be significantly more congested compared to normal Sundays, including:


Hong Kong Island: King's Road, Java Road, Shau Kei Wan Road, Causeway Road, Victoria Park Road, Yee Wo Street, Gloucester Road, Hennessy Road, Connaught Road Central, Harcourt Road, Queensway, the Aberdeen Tunnel (Wan Chai bound) and the vicinity of Central Ferry Pier areas;
Kowloon: Kwun Tong Road, Wai Yip Street, Prince Edward Road East and the vicinity of Kowloon Bay areas; and
New Territories: The Tseung Kwan O Tunnel (Kowloon bound).


 Motorists are advised to avoid driving to the above affected areas. In case of traffic congestion, motorists should exercise patience, drive with care, and follow the instructions of the Police on-site.

 In view of the temporary road closures, 56 bus routes (including 14 KMB routes, 22 Citybus routes and 20 Cross Harbour Bus routes) and 15 Green Minibus routes will be affected and subject to diversion, truncation or relocation of stops in phases until the reopening of the roads. During the road closure period, taxi stands (including taxi pick-up/drop-off points), public light bus stands, roadside parking spaces and private car parks on the affected roads will be suspended.

 To enable participants travelling to Causeway Bay for the full and half marathon races, which have the earliest starting times of 5.15am and 5.55am respectively, the first departures of all MTR rail lines (except the Airport Express and Disneyland Resort Line) will be suitably advanced on Sunday, with the first departures on the Tuen Ma Line and East Rail Line to be operated at 2.50am. In addition, one special bus route will also be operated to serve event participants travelling to Causeway Bay this Sunday.

 Members of the public should plan their journeys early to avoid unexpected delays and use public transport services (particularly railway services) as far as possible, paying attention to the arrangements of temporary route diversions and relocations of stops. They may browse the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk) or mobile application ""HKeMobility"" for information about special traffic and transport information, or they may also browse relevant public transport operators' websites or mobile applications for details of service changes.

 The TD and the Police will closely monitor the traffic situation. Other temporary road and traffic control measures, including adjusting the extent of road closures and altering or suspending public transport services, may be implemented by the Police at short notice depending on the actual traffic conditions. Members of the public are advised to stay alert to the latest traffic news."

業主不遵從清拆令被判罰款逾八十萬元,2025-11-19 11:00,2025-11-19 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900216.htm,"​一名業主由於不遵從根據《建築物條例》（第123章）發出的清拆令，昨日(十一月十八日)在粉嶺裁判法院被定罪及判罰款合共806,000元，當中182,000元屬就罪行持續的日數所判的罰款。

有關個䅁涉及一個位於橫跨北區虎地坳丈量約份第52約地段其中十三個分段的違例搭建物，面積約6 000平方米。由於有關僭建物不會獲地政總署發出豁免證明書，亦並無事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，屋宇署根據《建築物條例》第24（1）條向業主發出13張清拆令。該業主沒有履行清拆令，故遭屋宇署檢控。

屋宇署發言人今日（十一月十九日）說：「僭建物可導致嚴重後果。業主必須盡快遵從清拆令。對於未有遵從清拆令的業主，屋宇署會繼續採取執法行動，包括提出檢控，以保障樓宇及公眾安全。」

根據《建築物條例》，任何人無合理辯解而沒有遵從清拆令是嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可處罰款200,000元及監禁一年，及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款最高20,000元。"

The case involved an unauthorised structure with an area of about 6 000 square metres across 13 sections of a lot in D.D. 52, Fu Tei Au, North District. Since the Lands Department would not issue a certificate of exemption for the unauthorised building works (UBWs) and the UBWs were also carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), 13 removal orders were served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal orders, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (November 19), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

徐浩光博士說：「環保署持續完善廚餘回收網絡，並加強宣傳教育，推動更多市民參與廚餘回收。現時已有超過1 500個設於公共屋邨、私人屋苑等地點的家居廚餘回收設施。環保署去年更策略性地在全港各區逐步設立約250個公眾廚餘回收點，當中在夜間營運的『廚餘回收流動點』，更可為繁忙都市中的居民提供便捷的廚餘回收途徑。在最新推出的『廚餘回收車試驗計劃』下，回收車每晚走訪不同地點推廣廚餘回收，並讓市民認識和體驗廚餘回收。我們希望藉此便利市民，鼓勵更多市民實踐綠色生活。」

「廚餘回收車試驗計劃」上月率先在中西區試行，回收車每晚六時三十分至十時三十分，走訪區內四個指定地點，向市民推廣源頭分類及正確回收廚餘的方法，並為市民提供便利的廚餘回收途徑。四個服務地點包括：

1. 半山區麥當勞道（近聚安樓）：晚上六時三十分至七時十五分
2. 西營盤港鐵站C出口外停車處：晚上七時四十分至八時二十五分
3. 堅尼地城堅彌地城海旁（近明珠閣）：晚上八時四十五分至九時三十分
4. 堅尼地城堅彌地城新海旁（近嘉安大廈）：晚上九時四十五分至十時三十分

計及「廚餘回收車試驗計劃」，全港在夜間營運的「廚餘回收流動點」已達至104個（見附件），每日在晚間時分於貼近民居或食肆地點定時定點運作，方便附近居民及食肆在晚間處理廚餘，養成廚餘回收的習慣。

透過推行各種措施，廚餘回收量近年持續上升。整體廚餘回收量已達至每日340公噸，較二○二三年增長一倍，當中家居廚餘回收量由二○二三年每日七公噸大幅增至現時約130公噸。

徐浩光博士和鄭健向在場市民介紹「廚餘回收車試驗計劃」，聽取他們對環保署回收服務的意見，並向市民宣傳十二月七日舉行的立法會選舉。

徐浩光博士說：「我呼籲大家在十二月七日與家人一同履行公民責任，踴躍投票，選出愛國愛港的有能之士，為香港未來的發展作出貢獻。」"
DEP inspects operation of food waste recycling truck and calls on public to cast votes in Legislative Council General Election (with photos),2025-11-19 10:30,2025-11-19 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111800660.htm,"The Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui, and the Deputy Director of Environment Protection (Waste Reduction), Mr Kenneth Cheng, inspected the operation of the Trial Scheme on Food Waste Recycling Truck (Trial Scheme) in Central and Western District on November 17 and promoted food waste recycling to the public. They took the opportunity to call on the public to cast their votes in the Legislative Council (LegCo) General Election on December 7.

Dr Chui said, ""The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has been continuously enhancing the food waste recycling network, and strengthening publicity and education to encourage more people to participate in food waste recycling. Currently, there are more than 1 500 food waste recycling facilities set up in premises including public rental housing estates and private residential estates. Since last year, the EPD has been strategically setting up around 250 public food waste recycling points across all districts. Among these, the Food Waste Recycling Spots that operate at night time provide busy citizens with convenient recycling outlets for food waste. Under the newly launched Trial Scheme, a recycling truck visits various locations every evening to promote food waste recycling, allowing members of the public to learn about and experience food waste recycling for themselves. We hope this make it convenient for people to practise green living.""

The Trial Scheme was rolled out first in Central and Western District last month. A food waste recycling truck operates from 6.30pm to 10.30pm every night, visiting four designated locations in the district to promote waste separation at source and proper ways of food waste recycling, and provide a convenient outlet for the public to recycle food waste. The four designated locations are:


MacDonnell Road, Mid-levels (near Silvercrest): 6.30pm to 7.15pm
Parking Area outside Exit C of Sai Ying Pun MTR Station: 7.40pm to 8.25pm
Praya Kennedy Town,Kennedy Town (near Brilliant Court): 8.45pm to 9.30pm
New Praya Kennedy Town,Kennedy Town (near Ka On Building): 9.45pm to 10.30pm


Including the Trial Scheme, the number of night-time Food Waste Recycling Spots has reached 104 (see annex). Operating at fixed times and locations during evening hours close to residential and dining areas, these recycling points facilitate nearby residents and eateries to dispose of food waste at night and develop recycling habits.

Through the implementation of various measures, the amount of food waste recycled has been on the rise in recent years. The overall food waste recycled has reached 340 tonnes per day, doubling the figure of 2023. In particular, the amount of domestic food waste recycled significantly increased from 7 tonnes per day in 2023 to about 130 tonnes per day currently.

Dr Chui and Mr Cheng introduced the Trial Scheme to the residents on-site and listened to their feedback on the EPD's recycling services. They also called on the public to support the LegCo General Election on December 7.

Dr Chui said, ""I urge everyone to exercise their civic responsibilities with their families by casting their votes on December 7. Let’s elect outstanding individuals with an affection for the country and Hong Kong to contribute to the future development of the city."""

HKSAR Government strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission report,2025-11-19 04:32,2025-11-19 05:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900087.htm,"  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government today (November 19) strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects the groundless attacks, slanders and smears against various aspects of the situation of the HKSAR including safeguarding national security, protecting human rights and business environmentin the so-called ""2025 report"" issued by the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC).

  The HKSAR Government spokesman stressed, ""The HKSAR Government strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects USCC's wanton manoeuvre with politics prevailing over law-based administration and interference in the affairs of the HKSAR in the so-called report. The HKSAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China, is a local administrative region that enjoys a high degree of autonomy under 'one country, two systems',and comes directly under the Central People's Government. The legal basis for implementing 'one country, two systems' comprises the Constitution and the Basic Law, which provide constitutional guarantee for fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to equality before the law, and is buttressed by the rule of law and independent judicial power.""

  ""The HKSAR steadfastly safeguards national sovereignty, security and development interests, and fully and faithfully lives up to this top priority of the 'one country, two systems' principle. The HKSAR Government will resolutely, fully and faithfully continue to implement the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL), the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) and other relevant laws so as to prevent, suppress and impose punishment on acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law. At the same time, it will safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people, ensuring the steadfast and successful implementation of 'one country, two systems'. The HKSAR Government strongly urges the US to discern facts from fallacies, respect the international law and basic norms governing international relations, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs.""

Laws Safeguarding National Security

  The spokesman stressed, ""Endangering national security is a very serious offence. No country will watch with folded arms on acts and activities that endanger national security. In terms of legislation relating to safeguarding national security, the US has at least 21 pieces. There have also been countless administrative orders issued in the name of so-called 'national security'. However, the relevant commission exposed their double standards as they pointed fingers at the HKSAR's legal system and enforcement mechanisms to safeguard national security, while totally disregarded the constitutional duty and practical needs of the HKSAR to legislate and continuously enhance relevant laws, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the relevant national security legislation on economic development and the protection of human rights.""

  ""In fact, the implementation of the HKNSL in the past five years or so has enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community at large to swiftly resume to normal and the business environment to be restored and improved continuously. With the support from all sectors of the community, the SNSO was unanimously passed by the Legislative Council, and took effect upon gazettal on March 23, 2024, thereby further improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms of the HKSAR for safeguarding national security. According to the Economic Freedom of the World 2025 Annual Report, Hong Kong has once again been ranked as the world's freest economy. Hong Kong's ranking improved by two places to third globally in the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025. Also, Hong Kong continues to rank among the top three international financial centres and comes first in the world in terms of funds raised through initial public offerings in the first three quarters of 2025. Hong Kong ranks the 24th out of 142 countries and jurisdictions globally in the 2025 World Justice Project Rule of Law Index. Its overall score (0.72) remained unchanged, matching the scores of the countries ranked 22nd and 23rd. Hong Kong remains high in the overall ranking and continues to be ahead of some European and American countries, including the US, which often unreasonably criticise the rule of law and human rights situation of Hong Kong. These internationally recognised achievements are built upon the freedom and stability brought to the Hong Kong society by the HKNSL, other relevant laws of the HKSAR, and the work of safeguarding national security.""

  ""As a matter of fact, the HKNSL and SNSO clearly define the elements of relevant offences, penalties, exceptions and defences. These laws actively prevent, suppress and punish acts and activities endangering national security, in accordance with the principle of the rule of law. They target an extremely small minority of individuals and organisations that pose a threat to national security, while protecting the lives and property of the general public and their legitimate rights and interests. Law-abiding persons will not unwittingly violate the law.""

  ""The HKSAR has the constitutional responsibility to continue to improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security. The purpose of the subsidiary legislation made under the SNSO in May 2025 is to better carry into effect the provisions of the HKNSL concerning the mandate of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (OSNS). The subsidiary legislation does not grant the OSNS any new power, and will not affect the lives of ordinary citizens or the normal operation of institutions or organisations.""

  ""Extraterritorial effect for offences under the HKNSL and the SNSO fully aligns with the principles of international law, international practice and common practice adopted in various countries and regions. It is both necessary and legitimate, and is also in line with those of other countries and regions around the world. As the law enforcement department of the HKSAR safeguarding national security, the Hong Kong Police Force are duty-bound to pursue the liability of those who have allegedly endangered national security outside Hong Kong. Those absconders hiding outside Hong Kong are wanted because they continue to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security and wantonly collude with external forces to cover for their evil deeds. It is necessary for the HKSAR Government to take all lawful measures. The specification of absconders in respect of offences endangering national security and specification of measures applicable against the relevant absconders under the SNSO aim to address, combat, deter and prevent acts of abscondment, and procure the return of absconders to Hong Kong to face law enforcement and judicial proceedings. Such actions are fully justified, necessary and legitimate. In fact, quite a number of countries including the US would also impose such measures on wanted criminals. The US's abuse of long-arm jurisdiction and indiscriminate use of so-called sanctions are the real form of 'transnational repression'.""

  ""The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, paying no regard to their political stance, background or occupation of the person or organisation involved. The HKSAR Government has repeatedly emphasised that the suggestion that any persons or organisations with certain backgrounds should be immune from legal sanctions for their illegal acts and activities is tantamount to granting such persons privileges to break the law and is totally contrary to the spirit of the rule of law. External forces continue to distort the truth, blatantly discredit the judicial system and trials of the HKSAR, in an attempt to glorify criminal behavior and exert pressure on the courts of the HKSAR. The HKSAR Government strongly urges the Committee to respect fundamental principles such as the spirit of the rule of law and judicial independence, and to immediately cease these despicable actions.""

Safeguarding Due Administration of Justice and Rule of Law

  ""The HKSAR Government emphasised that all judicial cases are handled strictly on the basis of evidence and in accordance with the law. All defendants will receive fair trial strictly in accordance with laws applicable to Hong Kong (including the HKNSL and the SNSO) and as protected by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. The so-called report specifically mentioned cases on offences endangering national security involving Wong Chi-fung and Lai Chee-ying, wantonly smearing the law enforcement, prosecution and judicial organs of the HKSAR regarding the handling of the relevant cases. Their ulterior motives are obvious, namely, to interfere with the judicial proceedings in the HKSAR by means of political power in order to procure a defendant's evasion of the criminal justice process. The HKSAR Government strongly condemned these blatant attempting to undermine the rule of law of the HKSAR.""

  The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""The HKSAR Government safeguards independent judicial power and fully supports the Judiciary in exercising its judicial power independently, safeguarding the due administration of justice and the rule of law. Articles 2, 19 and 85 of the Basic Law specifically provide that the HKSAR enjoys independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication, and the courts of the HKSAR shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference. The legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR will absolutely not undermine the independent judicial power. When handling cases involving offences endangering national security, judges, as in all other cases, perform their judicial duties independently and impartially, without any interference. The HKSAR Government supports the Judiciary to continue to seek suitable candidates, both locally and overseas, to serve as non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal, and to handle such judicial appointments in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance. The presence or absence of individual non-permanent judges have no impact on the integrity of the judicial system. In fact, many non-permanent judges have expressed confidence in the independence of the judicial officers of the HKSAR when they left office.""

  ""The Department of Justice, by virtue of Article 63 of the Basic Law, controls criminal prosecutions, makes independent prosecutorial decisions in accordance with the law, free from any interference. Prosecutions would be instituted by the Department of Justice only if there is sufficient admissible evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction, and if it is in the public interest to do so.""

  ""The Judiciary of the HKSAR exercises judicial power independently in accordance with the law, and everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to a fair hearing. All cases concerning offence endangering national security will be handled by the prosecution and judicial authorities of the HKSAR in a fair and timely manner in strict compliance with Article 42(1) of the HKNSL, with the procedural rights of defendants exercised in accordance with the law fully respected throughout the process. The courts decide cases strictly in accordance with the evidence and all applicable laws, and cases will never be handled any differently owing to the profession, political beliefs or background of the persons involved. The prosecution has the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission of an offence before a defendant may be convicted by the court.""

  ""The so-called 'report' threatened again to impose 'sanctions' on the HKSAR, attempting to use political power to deter relevant personnel in the HKSAR from discharging their responsibilities to safeguard national security, interfering in the law enforcement and judicial process of the HKSAR. All these are reprehensible acts undermining the rule of law of the HKSAR, which the HKSAR Government strongly condemns. All relevant personnel in the HKSAR will not be intimidated and will continue to resolutely discharge the responsibility of safeguarding national security.""

Anti-Money Laundering and Enforcement of Sanctions

  The HKSAR Government spokesman continued, ""It is high on the HKSAR Government's agenda to maintain the integrity and robustness of our financial systems. Our banks and other financial institutions strictly adhere to international standards and best practices, including those on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). Hong Kong has been recognised by the Financial Action Task Force, the international standard-setter on AML/CFT, to be overall compliant with the relevant international standards, with a robust legal framework and effective system, especially in the identification and understanding of risks, law enforcement, asset recovery and international co-operation.""

  The HKSAR Government spokesman said, ""The HKSAR Government has been enforcing the sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) fully and vigorously to fulfil our international obligations. We do not implement unilateral sanctions imposed by other countries that constitute a flagrant violation of the international order based on international law and the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The HKSARG has long been maintaining an effective mechanism for implementing the resolutions of the UNSC. That includes denying entry of vessels designated by the UNSC as well as suspicious vessels, keeping a close watch on and inspecting suspicious Hong Kong-based companies to prevent them from participating in activities evading UNSC sanctions, and participating in the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Arms Trade Treaty through the Central People's Government. The effectiveness of our work has been well respected and recognised by our trading partners.""

SafeguardingRights andFreedoms

  The HKSAR Government spokesman said, ""The HKSAR Government steadfastly safeguards the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people as protected under the law. Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, human rights in the city have always been robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. The HKNSL and the SNSO also clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and that the rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, shall be protected in accordance with the law. Nonetheless, just as the case with other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. The ICCPR also expressly states that some of them may be subject to restrictions as prescribed by law that are necessary for protection of national security, public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms of others, etc. Indeed, Article 19 of the ICCPR specifically requires that journalists must observe and discharge 'special duties and responsibilities' including protection of national security or public order.""

  ""In fact, since the implementation of the HKNSL and the SNSO, the media landscape in Hong Kong has remained vibrant. However, some people with ulterior motives deliberately fabricated facts about freedom of the press and speech in Hong Kong. Like all other places in the world, freedom of the press and speech are not absolute. The media, like everyone else, has an obligation to abide by all the laws. The media continue to enjoy the freedom to comment on and criticise government policies without any restriction, as long as this is not in violation of the law. The court further cited precedents from the European Court of Human Rights regarding press freedom in the reasons for verdict of a relevant case, pointing out that the European Convention on Human Rights does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of speech even with respect to press coverage on matters of serious public concern. The most crucial point is that journalists must act in good faith and on accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism' in order to enjoy the protection of their rights to freedom of speech and press freedom.""

Maintaining long-term prosperity and stability

ããThe spokesmanreiterated, ""Under 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong has the distinctive advantageof enjoying strong support of the motherland while being closely connected to the world. With such unparalleled connectivity, Hong Kong will continue to play its dual role as ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"". Hong Kong will also continue to leverage its strengths to enhance its role as international financial, maritime and trade centres, among others, whilst proactively integrating into the overall development of our nation, including the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, the high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative, etc.. The HKSAR Government will continue to identify new areas for economic development and proactively compete for enterprises and talents with a view to promoting the sustainable development and enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong. As a matter of fact, Hong Kong has once again been ranked as the world’s freest economy by the Fraser Institute. On the other hand, the US enjoys significant economic benefits in Hong Kong and has realised a trade surplus of more than US$270 billion with Hong Kong over the past 10 years, the largest among US global trading partners. There are about 1 390 US companies with their businesses in Hong Kong. All these demonstrate the close and long-standing economic ties between Hong Kong and the US, as well as the vast business interests of the US in Hong Kong. A stable and prosperous Hong Kong is certainly of mutual benefits to Hong Kong and the US."""
特區政府強烈不滿和堅決反對美中經濟與安全審議委員會報告,2025-11-19 04:20,2025-11-19 04:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900088.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（十一月十九日）就美中經濟與安全審議委員會發表所謂「二零二五年報告」，以失實和偏頗的言論，污衊抹黑香港特區維護國家安全、保障人權、營商環境等各方面的情況，表示強烈譴責，並必須嚴厲直斥其非。

特區政府發言人強調：「特區政府強烈不滿和堅決反對美中經濟與安全審議委員會肆意以政治凌駕法治，一再透過所謂『報告』干預香港特區事務。香港特區是中華人民共和國不可分離的部分，是一個在『一國兩制』下享有高度自治權、直轄於中央人民政府的地方行政區域。『一國兩制』是以《憲法》和《基本法》為法律依據實施，它們為基本權利和自由提供憲制上的保證，包括法律面前一律平等的權利保證，更在法治和獨立司法權之下得以鞏固。」

「香港特區堅決維護國家主權、安全和發展利益，全面準確貫徹『一國兩制』方針的最高原則。特區政府會繼續堅定不移全面準確實施《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》和其他相關法律，依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，同時保障香港市民的權利和自由，確保『一國兩制』實踐行穩致遠。特區政府再次強烈敦促美國認清事實，遵從國際法和國際關係的基本準則，立即停止干涉純屬中國內政的香港事務。」

維護國家安全相關法律

發言人強調：「危害國家安全是嚴重的罪行，沒有國家會對危害國家安全的行為和活動袖手旁觀。在維護國家安全方面的法律，美國就最少有21部，而以所謂『國家安全』為名義簽發的行政命令更不計其數。有關委員會卻對香港特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制指手畫腳，全然漠視香港特區訂立及持續優化相關法律的憲制責任和實際需要，以及在維護國家安全的相關法律訂立後，對經濟發展和人權保障所帶來的正面效果，是實實在在的雙重標準。」

「事實是，《香港國安法》實施五年多以來，讓廣大香港市民生活和經濟活動迅速回復正常，營商環境得以恢復並不斷提升。《維護國家安全條例》在香港社會各界廣泛支持下，獲立法會全票通過，並於二○二四年三月二十三日刊憲生效後，使特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制進一步得以完善。根據《世界經濟自由度2025年度報告》，香港繼續獲評為全球最自由經濟體；香港在《2025年世界競爭力年報》的排名躍升兩位至全球第三；香港在全球國際金融中心中位列三甲，並在今年首三季首次公開招股集資額位居全球首位；香港在《2025年法治指數》的排名在全球142個國家和地區中位列24，整體分數（0.72）不變，與排名22和23的國家相同，整體排名維持高位，並繼續領先於包括美國在內一些不時無理批評香港法治和人權狀況的歐美國家。這些國際認可的成就都是建基於《香港國安法》及其他特區相關法律和維護國家安全工作為香港社會帶來的自由、安穩。」

「事實上，《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》清楚訂明構成有關罪行的元素和刑罰、例外情況和免責辯護，按法治原則堅持積極防範，依法制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，只針對極少數危害國家安全的個人和組織，保障廣大市民的人身和財產安全以及合法權益。奉公守法的人不會誤墮法網。」

「香港特區有憲制責任持續完善維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制。2025年5月根據《維護國家安全條例》訂立的附屬法例，目的是為了更有效實施《香港國安法》關乎中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全公署（公署）職責的條文。附屬法例並不會賦予公署任何新的權力，亦不會影響一般市民的生活，以及機構或組織的正常運作。」

「《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》下的罪行訂有適當的域外效力，完全符合國際法原則、國際慣例和各國各地區通行做法，實屬必要和正當，並與世界其他國家和地區一致。香港警務處作為特區維護國家安全的執法部門，有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌危害國家安全的惡行。該等一直潛藏境外的潛逃者被通緝，是因為他們在當地繼續公然從事危害國家安全的勾當，肆意勾結外部勢力包庇其惡行。特區政府採取一切合法措施，根據《維護國家安全條例》指明危害國家安全罪行的潛逃者及指明針對有關潛逃者施行的措施，目的是應對、打擊、阻嚇和防止潛逃行為，以及促使有關潛逃者回港接受執法和司法程序，做法有理有據，實屬必要和正當。事實上，包括美國等不少國家也會就不同的通緝犯施行措施打擊潛逃行為。美方濫施長臂管轄、亂揮『制裁』大棒，才是真正的『跨境鎮壓』。」

「香港特區執法部門一直根據證據、嚴格依照法律，以及按有關人士或單位的行為而採取執法行動，與涉事人士或組織的政治立場、背景或職業無關。特區政府已多次強調，倡議某種背景的人或組織不應就其違法行為和活動受到法律制裁，等同給予其犯法特權，完全違反法治精神。外部勢力顛倒是非、公然抹黑香港特區的司法制度和審訊，企圖美化犯罪行為，特區政府強烈敦促委員會，尊重法治精神和司法獨立等基本準則，立即停止上述卑劣行為。」

維護司法公正和法治精神

「特區政府強調所有司法案件均是嚴格根據證據和依照法律處理。所有被告均嚴格按照香港適用法律（包括《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》），並在《基本法》及《香港人權法案》的保障下接受公平審訊。所謂『報告』中特別提及到黃之鋒及黎智英所涉的危害國家安全犯罪案件，肆意就有關案件的辦理抹黑香港特區的執法、檢控和司法機關，其目的昭然若揭，就是企圖利用政治力量干預香港特區司法程序，以促使任何被告人不能獲得應有公平審訊。特區政府對這些妄圖破壞香港特區法治的行為，予以強烈譴責。」

發言人續指出：「特區政府維護獨立的司法權，全力支持司法機構依法獨立行使審判權，維護司法公正和法治精神。《基本法》第二條、第十九條及第八十五條訂明，香港特區享有獨立的司法權和終審權，法院獨立進行審判，不受任何干涉。香港特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制絕對沒有損害獨立司法權。法官在處理危害國家安全犯罪案件時，一如其他案件，都是獨立公正地履行司法職責，不受任何干涉。特區政府支持司法機構繼續物色本地及海外的合適人選出任終審法院非常任法官，並按《基本法》及《香港終審法院條例》相關規定處理有關司法任命。個別非常任法官的去留，絕無影響香港特區司法制度的基礎。事實上，不少非常任法官離任時，均表示對香港特區司法人員的獨立性有信心。」

「律政司按《基本法》第六十三條主管刑事檢控工作，依法獨立作出檢控決定，不受任何干涉，律政司在有充分證據令案件有合理機會達致定罪，以及在合乎公眾利益的情況下，才會提出起訴。」

「香港特區司法機關依法獨立行使審判權，而所有面對刑事指控的人都享有接受公平審訊的權利。檢控機關和司法機關嚴格履行《香港國安法》第四十二條第一款的責任，確保所有危害國家安全犯罪案件得到公正、及時辦理，過程中充分尊重被告人依法行使各項程序權利。法院嚴格按照證據和所有適用法律判案，案件不會因涉案者的職業、政治理念或背景而在處理上有所不同。控方亦有責任在毫無合理疑點下證明被告人犯罪，被告人才可被法庭定罪。」

「美方所謂『報告』又再威嚇對香港特區實施所謂『制裁』，企圖利用政治力量阻嚇香港特區相關人員履行維護國家安全職責，肆意干預香港特區的執法和司法程序，這些都是破壞法治的行為，特區政府予以強烈譴責。香港特區相關人員無懼任何恫嚇，定當繼續堅定不移履行維護國家安全的責任。」

打擊洗錢和執行制裁

發言人又指出︰「特區政府高度重視維護金融體系的誠信及穩健。本港銀行和其他金融機構均嚴格遵守包括打擊洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的國際標準和最佳做法。專責制訂打擊洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集國際標準的財務行動特別組織已確認香港整體，尤其在識別及了解風險、執法、追討資產及國際合作等方面符合相關國際標準，並擁有健全的法律架構及有效的制度。」

發言人續指出︰「特區政府一直全面及嚴格執行聯合國安全理事會（安理會）施加的制裁，以履行國際義務。我們不會執行其他國家施加的單邊制裁。這些制裁違反以國際法為基礎的國際秩序，和以《聯合國憲章》宗旨和原則為基礎的國際關係基本準則。特區政府通過有效的機制執行聯合國安理會的決議，包括拒絕聯合國安理會指定及可疑的船隻進入香港；監察和巡查可疑的香港公司，防止其參與規避聯合國制裁的活動；以及通過中央人民政府參與《化學武器公約》及《武器貿易條約》。我們的工作成效，一直獲得各貿易夥伴的尊重和認同。」

保障權利和自由

發言人表示：「特區政府堅定維護香港市民受到法律保障的權利和自由。自香港回歸祖國以來，人權一直受到《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實憲制保障。《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》亦清楚訂明香港特區維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》、《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港，有關言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會、遊行、示威的權利和自由。然而，和世界其他地方一樣，有關權利和自由並非絕對，《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》亦清楚訂明，在有必要保障國家安全、公共安全、公共秩序或他人的權利和自由等情況下，可以依法限制部分權利和自由。《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》第十九條更清楚指出，新聞從業員必須遵守及執行『特別責任和義務』，包括保障國家安全或公共秩序。」

「事實上，自《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》實施以來，本港的傳媒環境蓬勃依然。惟部分別有用心人士卻刻意捏造有關香港新聞和言論自由的事實。與世界其他地方一樣，新聞和言論自由並非絕對，傳媒與其他人一樣都有義務遵守所有法律。只要不違法，傳媒繼續享有評論和批評政府施政的自由，全然不受限制。法庭在相關案件的裁決理由也引用了歐洲人權法院關於新聞自由的判例，指出即使是報道涉及備受公眾關注的重要議題，在《歐洲人權公約》下也不享有完全不受限制的言論自由；最重要的一點是，新聞工作者必須按『負責任新聞作業』原則真誠地行事，以準確事實為基礎，並提供準確可靠的資訊，方可獲言論和新聞自由權利保障。」

保持長期繁榮穩定

發言人重申：「在『一國兩制』下，香港擁有『背靠祖國、聯通世界』此得天獨厚的顯著優勢，並會藉此繼續發揮其作為『超級連繫人』和『超級增值人』的雙角色。香港亦會繼續發揮其優勢以鞏固國際金融、航運和貿易中心等地位，以及積極融入國家發展大局包括參與粵港澳大灣區建設、『一帶一路』高質量發展等。特區政府會繼續發掘經濟發展新領域，及更積極進取地招商引才，以促進香港的持續發展及提升其競爭力。事實上，香港繼續獲菲沙研究所評定為全球最自由經濟體。另一方面，美國在港享有重大的經濟利益，美國對香港的貿易順差過去10年超過2 700億美元，是其全球貿易夥伴中最高，並有約1 390家美國公司在港設有業務。這些數字顯示香港跟美國兩地有密切而長遠的經濟往來，而美國企業在香港擁有龐大的商業利益。香港的繁榮穩定必定對香港與美國互惠互利。」"
引進重點企業辦公室執行總裁到訪上海　促進創科交流及推動重點企業落戶（附圖）,2025-11-18 23:24,2025-11-18 23:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800898.htm,"引進重點企業辦公室（引進辦）執行總裁彭文俊和其團隊於十一月十七日至十八日訪問上海，期間與當地生命健康科技領域龍頭及代表性企業深入交流，重點探討企業在香港發展的多元機遇，進一步推動香港國際醫療創新樞紐建設。

《行政長官2025年施政報告》明確聚焦產業發展和革新，當中特別提到生命健康科技領域方面，在「1+」新藥審批機制基礎上，將於二○二六年內成立「香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心」，助力藥企加速將創新藥推向市場。這些政策為企業落戶香港提供有力支撐，彰顯香港打造國際醫療創新樞紐的決心。

訪問期間，彭文俊一行到訪一家中國醫藥工業百強榜前十強的藥企。該企業全球佈局六大研發中心，11個生產基地。團隊與企業管理層分享一系列推動香港國際醫療創新樞紐的政策，包括設立「粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所」，為海內外的醫藥研發機構提供支援，協調開展多中心跨境臨床試驗，務求有關臨床試驗可同時符合國家及國際標準。企業管理層對香港高度國際化、高水平醫療專業和科研的獨特優勢表示高度認同，同時表示將與引進辦緊密合作，積極利用香港作為平台，全面推進創新研發國際化布局。

其後，引進辦團隊拜訪一家全球排名前50強，且已在港上市的製藥企業，與管理層舉行會談。該企業擁有內地最大的抗腫瘤藥及手術用藥研發生產基地，是內地極具創新能力的大型製藥企業。企業管理層表示，「1+」新藥審批機制為其產品進入香港市場提供重要政策支持，對香港政府在創科領域的投入與決心表示肯定。雙方一致認為，香港憑藉豐富的高端人才資源及國際網絡，已成為企業「走出去」的重要橋頭堡。雙方並達成共識，將全面推進在港設立海外總部、研發中心、企業財資中心及藥物註冊等合作事宜。

Executive Director of OASES visits Shanghai to foster I&T exchanges and encourage strategic enterprises' expansion in Hong Kong (with photos),2025-11-18 23:24,2025-11-18 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800897.htm,"The Executive Director of the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES), Mr Bryan Peng, and his team conducted a duty visit to Shanghai from November 17 to 18. During the visit, the OASES team engaged in in-depth discussions with leading and representative companies in the life and health technology sector. Their focus was on exploring diverse business development opportunities in Hong Kong and promoting the establishment of Hong Kong as a hub for health and medical innovation.

The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address clearly emphasises the importance of industry development and reform. Regarding the life and health technology industry, a key highlight is the establishment of the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation by the end of 2026. Complementing this initiative is the new drug approval mechanism (""1+"" mechanism) which facilitates pharmaceutical companies in accelerating the market launch of innovative drugs. Such policies provide strong support for companies to expand their businesses in Hong Kong and demonstrate the Government's commitment to becoming an international hub for health and medical innovation.

During the visit, Mr Peng and his team visited a pharmaceutical company ranked among the top ten in China's pharmaceutical industry. The company has established 6 R&D centres worldwide and 11 manufacturing sites. In discussions with the company's management, they shared a series of policies aimed at promoting Hong Kong as an international hub for health and medical innovation, including the establishment of the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute which supports both local and international pharmaceutical research institutions and co-ordinates multi-centre clinical trials with cross-border research transformation, ensuring that these trials meet both national and international standards. The company's management recognised Hong Kong's unique advantages, including its high level of internationalisation and expertise in medical and research fields. They expressed their commitment to closely collaborate with OASES, actively utilising Hong Kong as a platform to advance their international innovation and R&D initiatives.

Subsequently, the team met with the management of a pharmaceutical company ranked among the top 50 globally and listed in Hong Kong. The company operates the largest research and production base for anti-tumour and surgical drugs in Chinese Mainland and is recognised as a highly innovative large-scale pharmaceutical company. The management expressed that the ""1+"" mechanism provides essential policy support for their products entering the Hong Kong market and affirmed the Government's investment and determination in the innovation and technology sector. Both parties agreed that Hong Kong, with its abundant high-end talent and international network, has become an important bridgehead for companies looking to expand globally. They also reached a consensus on advancing co-operation, including the establishment of overseas headquarter, research centre, corporate treasury centre, and drug registrations in Hong Kong.

The team also visited the Shanghai branch of an international pharmaceutical multinational cooperation, where the OASES team was invited to participate in their ""Expert Talk"" event, engaging with teams and research management experts from various regions worldwide. During the event, Mr Peng and the Chief Manager (Life and Health Technology) of the OASES,Dr Maggie Lo,provided a detailed introduction on Hong Kong's innovation and technology policies and dedicated support schemes in the life and health technology sector. This presentation generated widespread interest among the participating experts and company representatives. The OASES team will provide necessary support to relevant projects aimed at being implemented in Hong Kong.

Mr Peng remarked that the visit was highly fruitful. Through in-depth communication with industry leaders and representative companies, they effectively helped the companies gain a better understanding of Hong Kong's latest policies and provided critical insights for those looking to expand their global operations by leveraging Hong Kong's advantages as an innovation and technology hub. He emphasised that OASES is committed to attracting top international and Chinese Mainland pharmaceutical companies to establish operations in Hong Kong, in line with the key priorities outlined in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address. Looking ahead, OASES will continue to expand its efforts and assist leading innovation and technology enterprises worldwide to establish in Hong Kong, further promoting the long-term development of the innovation and technology industry in Hong Kong."
FEHD wins consecutive best public toilet awards,2025-11-18 22:17,2025-11-18 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800909.htm,"A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (November 18) that the department is delighted to have won consecutive gold and silver awards this year in the annual Hong Kong's Best Public Toilet Award organised by the Hong Kong Toilet Association.

Having won the gold award, the Lan Kwai Fong Public Toilet in Central and Western District is equipped with an air-conditioning system, facilities such as automatic sensor water taps and soap dispensers, and a touchless flush system. Toilet attendants provide round-the-clock service during weekends and public holidays. The Kam Tin Shi Public Toilet in Yuen Long District has won the silver award. With a simple and unpretentious appearance as well as a bright and hygienic interior design, the toilet is equipped with facilities including the three-in-one Cabinet Wash Hand Basin (combining automatic sensor water tap, soap dispenser and hand dryer), and a touchless flush system.

""In recent years, the FEHD has been enhancing the facilities, management and hygiene of public toilets (PTs), taking a multi-pronged approach and introducing new technologies to provide a better user experience for the public. We are delighted to learn that the PTs of the FEHD have won best toilet awards in consecutive years. This recognition is a testament to the department's hard work and dedication.""

The FEHD has earlier noted the ageing of facilities in Sai Ying Pun Market toilets and Kowloon City Road Public Toilet, and has already made facelifting and refurbishment plans. Among which, the toilet on the ground floor of Sai Ying Pun Market is scheduled to re-open within this month upon the completion of refurbishment works, while the works for the rest will commence in the coming months. Before the facelifting and refurbishment works are completed, the FEHD will enhance cleansing and collaborate with relevant departments to expedite the repair of damaged facilities.

The spokesman said, ""The FEHD will continue to enhance the hygiene and management of PTs under its purview, and improve the facilities and service quality of PTs through innovative ideas. We appeal to the public to maintain the cleanliness and hygiene of public facilities and help ensure that PTs are well cared for.""

The FEHD currently manages over 800 PTs. Since 2019-20, the FEHD and Architectural Services Department (ArchSD) have been proactively forging ahead with the Enhanced Public Toilet Refurbishment Programme. As of this September, full refurbishment or facelifting for about 480 PTs has been rolled out, with approximately 190 of these projects already completed. By planning ahead, streamlining or compressing preliminary work flows and adopting new construction methods and technologies, the FEHD and the ArchSD aim to commence full refurbishment or facelifting works for the remaining some 200 PTs across the territory by the end of 2028.

The FEHD employs technologies to enhance the service of PTs, including installing sensors in 15 PTs to monitor usage rates and environmental parameters in real time. When odour concentration is detected to have reached an alarming level, the system will immediately notify the responsible staff through an SMS message to arrange cleansing. Additionally, novel air purification technologies are utilised to catalytically decompose pollutants and to eliminate odour at source. Ozone generators are also deployed in individual PTs to convert the oxygen in the air to ozone, and through nanobubble technology, effectively oxidise the bacteria and viruses in water, preventing the formation of biofilms on toilet surfaces and reducing odours generated from excreta.

The FEHD has installed wireless broadcasting systems in approximately 200 PTs located at tourist attractions or with high utilisation rates across the territory to promote the importance of toilet cleanliness and proper use of facilities. Furthermore, public toilet cleansing services are gradually being separated from the street cleansing service contracts and procured independently under dedicated contracts. Provisions requiring toilet attendants to have received relevant vocational training with recognised qualifications are included in the new public toilet management service contracts with a view to upgrading the service standards."

EEB and power companies announce 2026 electricity tariff adjustment (with photo/video),2025-11-18 20:05,2025-11-18 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800787.htm,"âThe Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) and the two power companies announced today (November 18) the electricity tariff adjustment for next year. After negotiation with the Government, CLP Power Hong Kong Limited and Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CLP Power) will reduce their average Net Tariff by 2.6 per cent to 140.6 cents per kWh with effect from January 1, 2026, and the Hongkong Electric Company Limited (HK Electric) will lower their average Net Tariff by 2.2 per cent to 163.3 cents per kWh.

The Secretary for the Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, said at the press conference today that the Government's energy policy objectives are to ensure that the public will enjoy safe, reliable and environmentally friendly electricity supply at reasonable costs. Therefore, the Government has been diligently playing a gate-keeping role in accordance with the Scheme of Control Agreements. After rounds of negotiations, the two power companies eventually agreed to lower the average Net Tariff starting January next year. Regarding the Basic Tariff, CLP Power agreed to reduce the next year's Basic Tariff to a level lower than the projected level of Basic Tariff under its five-year Development Plan, while HK Electric's Basic Tariff remains consistent with the projected level.

Mr Tse said, ""Based on the two power companies' estimates, after the tariff adjustment, a typical three-member family household with monthly consumption of 275kWh will pay around $10 less each month compared to the approved rates for 2025.""

The CLP Power Managing Director, Mr Joseph Law, said, ""We expect the tariff reduction to help lower living expenses of households and operating costs of small and medium-sized enterprises. We also allocate $270 million from the CLP Community Energy Saving Fund to promote energy conservation and decarbonisation, support the underprivileged, and inject momentum into Hong Kong's economy. While geopolitical tensions continue to pose uncertainties to fuel prices, we remain committed to managing fuel costs through a diversified fuel mix as well as upholding prudent financial management and enhancing operational efficiency with innovative technologies in delivering reliable, environmentally responsible, and reasonably priced electricity services.""

The HK Electric Managing Director, Mr Francis Cheng, said, ""HK Electric has been committed to providing Hong Kong with a safe, reliable, and clean electricity supply over the years. Through prudent planning, we continuously replace assets that have reached or exceeded their design or useful lives, in accordance with their depreciation cycles or actual condition to ensure a stable and reliable power supply while avoiding unnecessary capital investment. In light of the increasingly severe cyberattack threats, IT systems have to be enhanced also to strengthen their resilience. These capital investments inevitably put pressure on tariffs. Notwithstanding, the relatively stable fuel prices mean the fuel clause charge will be reduced, resulting in the net electricity tariff next year lower than that in January this year.""

Mr Tse said, ""Notwithstanding a minor reduction in average net tariff next January, we encourage the general public to cultivate a green living style and select energy efficient electrical appliances for environmental protection, which will help further reduce electricity expenditure and carbon emissions, and protect the environment. The Government's Mandatory Energy Efficiency Labelling Scheme (MEELS), which covers 11 types of appliances, has fully implemented new grading standards for refrigerating appliances, washing machines and storage type electric water heaters since September 2025. The full implementation of MEELS is expected to bring an additional energy saving of about 270 million kWh per year, which is equivalent to annual electricity consumption of 80 000 typical three-member family households. The public is encouraged to visit Energy Saving Tips in Government's webpage Energy Saving for All to get to know more about ways to save energy and practice 'smart electricity consumption' together."""
Speech by STL at Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board Flagship Session (English only) (with photo),2025-11-18 20:01,2025-11-18 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800718.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board Flagship Session - Hong Kong: A Global Maritime Capital today (November 18):

Dr Moses Cheng (Chairman of the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board), distinguished industry leaders, partners, friends,

Good afternoon. It is my privilege to join you and open this flagship session hosted by the newly established Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board. The conversations these days have confirmed a powerful consensus: The global maritime industry now stands at a tipping point, and the capital for the great maritime decarbonisation is ready to flow. The critical question is, where will it find its gateway?

In today's ever-changing global maritime landscape, I stand before you with immense confidence that Hong Kong is positioning itself as Asia's Green Maritime Finance Capital Gateway. What a lengthy word but it inherits a lot of wisdom, ambitions and visions in this long phrase. We are building the bridge that connects the vast global pools of green capital with the multi-trillion-dollar investment opportunities in sustainable shipping. I think sustainability is the keyword.

This is not an aspiration; it is a strategic evolution of our core strengths. Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong offers a unique advantage and convergence: a unique bilingual common law system that keeps pace with international maritime regulatory practices, the world's freest economy with seamless flow of capital, as well as a top-notch maritime cluster comprised of over 1 200 companies, many of which actually benefit from the series of tax concessionary measures that Hong Kong has provided by legal mandate over the years. This is the stable, trusted platform to de-risk and deploy capital into one of the world's most critical energy transitions. Our strategic positioning is propelled by three main drivers.

First, we have the proven financial firepower and a complete maritime ecosystem necessary to power this transition. Hong Kong's position as Asia's leading green finance hub is undisputable. Last year, our green and sustainable debt market surpassed US$84 billion, with bonds alone capturing 45 per cent of the regional market. We are also pioneering the green finance technology itself, from launching the world's first government-issued tokenised green bond to the first multi-currency digital bond. I do not know whether you have the opportunity to listen to the Financial Secretary's speech at the ICS (International Chamber of Shipping) open summit yesterday. He made three important key observations about the growth areas in China, Asia and this part of the region including Hong Kong where we are propelling. The figures that I mentioned just now provide clear evidence for the global shipping community with the sophisticated, diverse capital required for the heavy upfront investments in green vessels, fuel infrastructure and clean energy ports. Yet, financial depth alone is not enough. What truly sets Hong Kong apart is our complete, integrated maritime ecosystem - a one-stop shop for the entire industry. This comprehensive ecosystem provides unparalleled support, where you will find, for example, 11 of the 12 International Group P&I (protection and indemnity) clubs and eight of the world's top 10 ship finance bookrunners for your insurance and capital needs. For resolving maritime disputes, we are recognised by the Baltic International Maritime Council as one of the world's four designated arbitration venues. We did not get such recognition yesterday, but we achieved that a few years ago. I would also like to emphasise, for operational support, five of the top 10 global ship managers are here, with three headquartered in our city. All this evidence and data imply that your entire network of partners, financiers, and peers is concentrated here, providing the collaborative muscle to power through the complex challenges of the green transition. I cannot agree more; the peer, the companion, the enjoyment of food and wine, and the companionship of Hong Kong all make doing business so friendly and enjoyable in Hong Kong.

Second, we are establishing Hong Kong into a green fuel bunkering and trading hub to create the bankable assets that capital seeks. Pioneering investments carry higher costs, and the full benefit of green investments may not be realised due to, for example, the low availability of green fuels. Our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering, with its five core strengths and strategies and 10 concrete actions, provides exactly a definitive roadmap to propel the green fuel bunkering and trading development in Hong Kong. Leveraging our unparalleled access to the Chinese Mainland's green fuel production, we are already delivering tangible, quick results from setting the national record for the largest single delivery of biodiesel at a Chinese port, to successfully transition into regularised LNG (liquefied natural gas) bunkering in Hong Kong waters. In a way, we are starting late but catching up fast. Our focus now is on the next generation of fuels. We are pioneering the future with methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen. To accelerate this, we secured a duty exemption for methanol through legislation and will commence feasibility studies for ammonia and hydrogen bunkering soon this year. We recognise the first-mover disadvantage of high initial costs, and that is precisely why we launched the Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering Incentive Scheme in order to help our partners to de-risk and reward pioneering companies. Like different industries, our shipping partners also like recognition and rewards. Though it may be small to the big businesses, it really serves as a symbolism and demonstration of how much care and attention we show to the industry. Next year, we will introduce legislation for a half-rate profits tax concession for the eligible commodity traders including those who trade in green maritime fuels. Coupled with our ongoing matchmaking events that connect Chinese Mainland enterprises with global end-users, we are not just building a fuel hub; we are creating the entire landscape and liquid marketplace required to finance and sustain the global fleet's transition. And here my keyword will be marketplace. When we talk about food and wine, companion and peer, we need to have a marketplace. We should not say platform, working group or task force; we need to use marketplace in order to be more lively and enjoyable.

Third, we are de-risking the industry's green capital investment by providing unwavering regulatory certainty and forging strategic global partnerships. Over the past few days, there have been closed door and open-door discussions about the disruption and delay of the IMO (International Maritime Organization) schedule. But I think rule-based aside, this will not hinder Hong Kong's determination to create a buoyant and dynamic ecosystem to help forge our journey towards green transformation. While international timelines may shift, Hong Kong offers decisive clarity. At home, we are proactively building comprehensive regulatory frameworks - governing everything from green fuel bunkering, with our Codes of Practice for LNG and Methanol and a mandate for the use of mass flow meters for methanol bunkering by 2026. I found it amazing that this tool and standard are just so important for ensuring fairness and transparency in green fuel bunkering. We will be introducing this mandate for mass flow metres for methanol bunkering by 2026 to the sustainable end-of-life recycling of vessels via the recent enactment of the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships into the local legislation, and we will do this well before the market peaks, with a view to providing investors the necessary confidence and certainty to commit for tomorrow. While the international timeline seems to delay a little bit, we have to act fast and act now for the preparation tomorrow. Concurrently, we are building the infrastructure of international collaboration. As the Chief Executive announced yesterday, we have announced the first batch of partner ports and established partner ports relationships with Guangxi port and Dalian port on the Chinese Mainland, as well as San Antonio Port of Chile. We will continue to identify partner ports for developing green shipping corridors - dedicated routes where vessels can achieve low or zero-carbon operations through co-ordinated green port services and fuel availability. For investors, these corridors could be strategic de-risking instruments that concentrate green capital, create scalable access and testbeds for zero-carbon operations, and, most importantly, drive down first-mover costs through knowledge and technological exchanges, ensuring today's pioneering investments become tomorrow's commercial success.

Ladies and gentlemen, the course is charted, the consensus is clear, and the capital is ready. In Hong Kong, if not other places. In Hong Kong, you can find more than just a port or a financial centre; you can find your strategic gateway for your green maritime finance capital, with our financial firepower to fund your ambitions, physical bunkering and trading hubs to power your vessels, and the regulatory certainty and global partnerships and a marketplace to de-risk your investments. The tides of change are not a threat to be weathered, but a powerful current we can harness together. We have the strategy, the ecosystem, and the unwavering commitment to succeed. So let me conclude with a clear invitation: Do not just navigate this transition - lead it from Hong Kong. Anchor your sustainable future here, and let us work in partnership to steer the global maritime industry towards a more prosperous and resilient zero-carbon future. Thank you very much."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-18 19:35,2025-11-18 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800784.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月十八日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名26歲男子，獨居於油尖旺區。初步調查顯示，他於十一月五日至十五日獨自到訪印度期間，先後出現發燒和關節痛（十一月八日和九日），昨日（十一月十七日）到廣華醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，目前情況穩定。

由於病人在潛伏期內身處印度，中心認為他是在海外受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會把個案通報當地衞生部門。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得64宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，近期基孔肯雅熱疫情呈持續下降趨勢。過去一周（十一月九日至十五日）廣東省新增48宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較對上一周（十一月二日至八日）的107宗進一步回落。上周個案主要分布在江門市（14宗）和深圳市（12宗）。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

就早前公布一宗涉及一名住在筲箕灣東熹苑的68歲女子的本地個案，中心仍在對該病人的病毒基因進行分析工作。

中心呼籲該名患者居所一帶居民，如於十月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員和東區關愛隊已向東熹苑一帶受影響地區約3 000個單位派發有關預防基孔肯雅熱的資料單張及問卷，提醒居民留意有否相關病徵和注意家居的環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過設於筲箕灣興東商場二樓的醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於東熹苑進行上門探訪，為逾4 900名市民進行評估，過去三日未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。中心已為四名早前出現輕微病徵的市民進行抽血檢查，全部對基孔肯雅病毒的檢測為陰性。鑑於近日前往醫護站的市民明顯減少，加上全部於上述醫護站接受抽血檢查的人士結果均為陰性，明日（十一月十九日）起，醫護站的運作時間會因應實際需要而調整，確實時間請參閱中心網站。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-18 19:35,2025-11-18 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800785.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 18),the CHP has recorded one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
--------------------------

  The case involves a 26-year-old male living alone in Yau Tsim Mong District. Initial investigation revealed that during his solo trip to India between November 5 and 15, he developed a fever and joint pain on November 8 and 9 respectively. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department at Kwong Wah Hospital yesterday (November 17) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. His blood sample tested positive for chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. He is currently in stable condition.

  Since the patient stayed in India during his incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected overseas. The case is classified as imported. The CHP will report the case to the relevant health authority.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 64 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, the recent outbreak of CF has shown a sustained downward trend. There were 48 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (November 9 to 15), showing a further decrease compared to the previous week (November 2 to 8), which reported 107 cases. The cases last week were mainly reported in Jiangmen (14 cases) and Shenzhen (12 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

Regarding the recently announced local case involving a 68-year-old female who lives in Tung Hei Court in Shau Kei Wan, the CHP is still conducting genome analysis.

The CHP urged the residents living in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 15. The CHP collaborated with the Eastern District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention and questionnaire surveys to about 3 000 households in the affected areas in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

  As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 4 900 individuals through the health consultation booth on 2/F, Hing Tung Shopping Centre in Shau Kei Wan, its inquiry hotline (2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits at Tung Hei Court. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past three days. Four individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests, and all testednegative for the chikungunya virus. Given the significant decrease in the number of citizens visiting the health consultation booth recently and all individuals who underwent blood tests at the booth concerned have negative results, the operating hours of the booth will be adjusted starting tomorrow (November 19) based on actual needs. Please refer to the CHP'swebpagefor the actual operating hours of the health consultation booth.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD.

​香港海關開展第二階段的完稅標籤制度先導計劃（附圖）,2025-11-18 19:32,2025-11-18 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800741.htm,"香港海關十月六日開展為期三個月的完稅標籤制度先導計劃於早前完成第一階段的測試，並於昨日（十一月十七日）展開第二階段先導計劃。

第一階段的測試，旨在於實際操作環境中模擬完稅標籤制度的運作流程及測試相關技術，為下一階段測試做好準備。在第一階段測試中，海關除了於海關課稅室為旅客帶入或以貨件進口香港的完稅香煙附貼試行完稅標籤外，亦借用本地香煙生產商的設備於實際操作環境中進行技術測試，包括構建電腦模組測試數據系統、於生產過程中附貼試行完稅標籤及將有關產品暫存保稅倉，並於完稅後推出零售市場的整個物流鏈流程。

綜合第一階段的測試結果及透過問卷收集的意見，顯示公眾對完稅標籤的設計均傾向正面，而生產過程中附貼標籤的成功率亦超過百分之九十九。

在第二階段的先導計劃中，海關會使用經優化的試行完稅標籤，其設計採用更輕薄的紙質及印上雷射圖案的防偽技術，已附貼標籤的香煙將視乎完稅情況，陸續推出全港的零售點出售，讓更多市民接觸到試行完稅標籤。

另一方面，第二階段的先導計劃亦會拓展至更多邊境口岸的海關課稅室，包括羅湖、香園圍及廣深港高速鐵路西九龍站，為旅客攜帶超過免稅限額的香煙在完稅後附貼試行完稅標籤。

海關將繼續推廣完稅標籤制度，並積極與煙草業界（包括香煙入口商）進行溝通，包括邀請他們參與第二階段的先導計劃。海關稍後將舉行講解會向業界提供標籤附貼流程資料及派發試行完稅標籤樣本作參考，並會透過問卷形式收集業界的意見，期望有關計劃能夠有助於完善完稅標籤制度的規劃，有效區分已完稅和未完稅香煙，打擊「白牌煙」。

針對市面有商販以低於煙草稅的價格銷售懷疑未完稅香煙，海關會繼續加強巡查並密切留意市場的最新情況，如發現任何形式的私煙買賣活動，必定會果斷執法。

根據新修訂《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），售價低於煙草稅的煙支須證明已課稅，否則會被推定為未完稅香煙。

海關呼籲各零售商切勿售賣來歷不明的香煙，對來貨價低於煙草稅的香煙，必須提高警覺，以避免刑事責任。海關提醒零售商和市民，根據《條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。"
Hong Kong Customs commences second phase of Pilot Run for Duty Stamp System (with photos),2025-11-18 19:32,2025-11-18 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800743.htm,"The first phase of the three-month Pilot Run for the Duty Stamp System launched by Hong Kong Customs on October 6 was completed recently and entered into the second phase starting yesterday (November 17).

The first phase of the Pilot Run, aimed to simulate the operational procedures of the Duty Stamp System in a real setting for testing related technologies and getting prepared for the next phase of testing. During the first phase, Customs not only affixed trial duty stamps to duty-paid cigarettes brought into Hong Kong by travellers or imported via small shipments at the Duty Collection Offices, but also conducted technical tests in actual operational environments using equipment from local cigarette manufacturers. This included building a computer module for testing the data system, affixing trial duty stamps during the production process, the storage of products in bonded warehouses after production, and releasing them to the retail market after duty payment, covering the entire logistics chain.

The test results of the first phase and opinions collected through questionnaires reflected that the general public indicated a positive attitude towards the design of the duty stamp and a success rate of over 99 per cent in the affixation of stamps during production was achieved.

In the second phase of the Pilot Run, Customs will use enhanced trial duty stamps which adopt thinner paper and a hologram as an anti-counterfeiting feature in the design. Cigarettes affixed with stamps, depending on their status of duty payment, will be available at retail outlets across all districts successively, allowing more members of the public access to the trial duty stamps.

Meanwhile, the second phase of the Pilot Run will be extended to cover more Duty Collection Offices at various control points, including Lo Wu, Heung Yuen Wai, and the West Kowloon Station of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, for affixing trial duty stamps to cigarettes carried by travellers exceeding the duty free concession after payment of duties.

  Customs will continue to promote the Duty Stamp System and actively communicate with the tobacco industry (including cigarette importers), as well as invite them to participate in the second phase of the Pilot Run. Customs will hold briefing sessions to provide more information on the duty stamp affixing procedures information, and distribute trial duty stamp samples for reference. Customs will also collect feedback from the industry through questionnaires with a view to enhancing the planning of the Duty Stamp System and thus achieve the ultimate goal of effective distinguishment of duty-paid cigarettes from duty-not-paid ones, and to combat the ""cheap whites"".

In response to the presence of sales outlets selling suspected duty-not-paid cigarettes below tobacco duty on the market, Customs will continue to step up patrol operations and closely monitor the latest market situation. Customs will take decisive enforcement action if any form of illicit cigarette trading activities is found.

Under the amended Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO), cigarettes sold at a price lower than the tobacco duty must be proven to be duty-paid, otherwise the cigarettes are presumed to be duty-not-paid.

Customs appeals to retailers not to sell cigarettes from unknown sources. Retailers must stay vigilant against cigarettes with wholesale prices lower than the tobacco duty in order to avoid criminal liability. Customs reminds retailers and members of the public that under the DCO, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years."
CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another severe paediatric influenza infection case reported,2025-11-18 19:32,2025-11-18 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800786.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 18) recorded a severe paediatric influenza infection case. The CHP reiterated its appeal to urge schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves a 14-year-old boy with underlying illness. He developed a convulsion on November 14 and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of United Christian Hospital, where was admitted. Yesterday (November 17), he developed dizziness, a fever and cough with sputum. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with pneumonia and shock. He is currently in serious condition.

The boy had not yet received the 2025/26 SIV. His household contacts are currently asymptomatic and no influenza outbreaks have been reported at his school recently.

Including the abovementioned case, there have been 19 severe influenza cases involving children so far this summer influenza season, including two fatal cases. The affected children aged 11 months to 17 years. Ten cases have been recorded since the launch of this year's SIV Programmes, with only one having received this year's SIV four days prior to the onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, in other words, these severe influenza cases are not protected by the vaccine.

""According to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity began to decline in the last week of October. However, it remains at a relatively high level. As the weather turns cooler, influenza activity may still fluctuate. Moreover, a winter influenza season may occur early next year. Therefore, I once again urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV to do so promptly. Compared to the winter influenza season earlier this year, there have been more severe paediatric influenza infection cases this season. Currently, among children aged below 18 years, the coverage rate of children aged 6 months to under 2 years is relatively low, at nearly 16 per cent only. Parents should not hesitate and should contact their family doctors as soon as possible to arrange for their children, as well as themselves and other family members, to receive the SIV,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

He also reminded members of the public that, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition.
