二○二五年六月份貨幣統計數字,2025-07-31 16:40,2025-07-31 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100596.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局今日（七月三十一日）發表的統計數字顯示，認可機構的存款總額在二○二五年六月份上升0.9%，其中港元存款下跌0.9%，外幣存款則上升2.4%，主要反映企業資金流動。二○二五年上半年，存款總額及港元存款分別上升7.6%及7.0%。香港人民幣存款在六月份下跌9.6%，於六月底為8,821億元人民幣，主要反映企業資金流動。跨境貿易結算的人民幣匯款總額於六月份為12,235億元人民幣，而五月份為11,236億元人民幣。存款變動受多項因素影響，包括利率走勢、市場集資活動等，因此適宜觀察較長期趨勢，毋須過度解讀個別月份的波動。

六月份貸款與墊款總額上升1.1%，二○二五年上半年上升2.5%。其中在香港使用的貸款（包括貿易融資）及香港境外使用的貸款在六月份分別上升0.9%及1.8%。由於港元存款下跌而港元貸款上升，港元貸存比率由五月底的70.5%，上升至六月底的72.0%。

在香港使用的貸款（包括貿易融資）繼上季上升0.5%後，在二○二五年第二季按季上升1.6%。按經濟用途分析，這些貸款於第二季的升幅主要由對金融公司的貸款，以及對電力及氣體燃料的貸款所帶動。

六月份港元貨幣供應量M2及M3均下跌0.8%，與去年同期比較則均上升8.4%。六月份經季節因素調整的港元貨幣供應量M1上升4.4%，與去年同期比較上升23.7%，部分反映投資相關活動。貨幣供應量總額M2及M3於六月份均上升0.8%，與去年同期比較，M2及M3均上升11.5%。

由於按月貨幣統計數字或會受到各種短期因素（例如季節性的資金需求，以及營商與投資相關活動）影響而出現波動，因此應小心詮釋統計數字。"
Monetary Statistics for June 2025,2025-07-31 16:40,2025-07-31 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100595.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

According to statistics published today (July 31) by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, total deposits with authorized institutions increased by 0.9 per cent in June 2025. Among the total, Hong Kong dollar deposits decreased by 0.9per cent while foreign currency deposits increased by 2.4per cent in June, mainly reflecting fund flows of corporates. For the first half of 2025 as a whole, total deposits and Hong Kong dollar deposits increased by 7.6per cent and 7.0per cent respectively. Renminbi deposits in Hong Kong decreased by 9.6per cent in June to RMB882.1 billion at the end of June, mainly reflecting fund flows of corporates. The total remittance of renminbi for cross-border trade settlement amounted to RMB1,223.5 billion in June, compared with RMB1,123.6 billion in May. It should be noted that changes in deposits are affected by a wide range of factors, such as interest rate movements and fund-raising activities. It is therefore more appropriate to observe the longer-term trends, and not to over-generalise fluctuations in a single month.

Total loans and advances increased by 1.1per cent in June, and increased by 2.5per cent in the first half of 2025. Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong (including trade finance) and loans for use outside Hong Kong increased by 0.9per cent and 1.8per cent respectively in June. The Hong Kong dollar loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 72.0per cent at the end of June from 70.5per cent at the end of May, as Hong Kong dollar deposits decreased while Hong Kong dollar loans increased.

For the second quarter of 2025 as a whole, loans for use in Hong Kong (including trade finance) increased by 1.6per cent after increasing by 0.5per cent in the previous quarter. Analysed by economic use, the increase in loans during the second quarter was mainly led by loans to financial concerns and loans to electricity and gas.

Hong Kong dollar M2 and M3 both decreased by 0.8per cent in June, while both increased by 8.4per cent when compared to a year ago. The seasonally-adjusted Hong Kong dollar M1 increased by 4.4per cent in June and increased by 23.7per cent compared to a year ago, reflecting in part investment-related activities. Total M2 and total M3 both increased by 0.8per cent in June. Compared to a year earlier, total M2 and total M3 both increased by 11.5 per cent. 

As monthly monetary statistics are subject to volatilities due to a wide range of transient factors, such as seasonal funding demand as well as business and investment-related activities, caution is required when interpreting the statistics."
二○二五年第二季末負資產住宅按揭貸款,2025-07-31 16:35,2025-07-31 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100594.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局今日（七月三十一日）公布二○二五年第二季末負資產住宅按揭貸款的最新調查結果。

二○二五年第二季末負資產住宅按揭貸款宗數為37 806宗，二○二五年第一季末為40 741宗。這些個案主要涉及銀行職員的住屋按揭貸款或按揭保險計劃的貸款，而這類貸款的按揭成數一般較高。

負資產住宅按揭貸款涉及的金額由二○二五年第一季末的2,059億港元，減少至二○二五年第二季末的1,902億港元。

負資產住宅按揭貸款中無抵押部分的金額由二○二五年第一季末的164億港元，減少至二○二五年第二季末的143億港元。

二○二五年第二季末拖欠三個月以上的負資產住宅按揭貸款比率為0.21%，相較二○二五年第一季末的0.17%，仍維持於低水平。

必須注意的是，此調查所得數字僅涉及銀行提供並已知道為負資產的一按貸款（即欠受訪機構的未償還貸款額超過按揭物業的當前市值），當中並不包括涉及二按，而連同二按計算屬於負資產貸款的住宅按揭貸款。由於銀行沒有客戶在二按下的未償還貸款的資料，因此無法知悉其中有多少宗屬於負資產貸款。

受訪認可機構的按揭貸款額約佔整個銀行體系按揭貸款總額的99%。調查結果是經過推算得出，以估計整個銀行體系的負資產按揭貸款情況。"

Residential mortgage loans in negative equity: End of June 2025,2025-07-31 16:35,2025-07-31 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100593.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced today (July 31) the results of its survey on residential mortgage loans (RMLs) in negative equity at end-June 2025.

The estimated number of RMLs in negative equity was 37 806 cases at end-June 2025, as compared to 40 741 cases at end-March 2025. These cases were mainly related to bank staff housing loans or RMLs under mortgage insurance programme, which generally have a higher loan-to-value ratio.

The aggregate value of RMLs in negative equity decreased to HK$190.2 billion at end-June 2025 compared with HK$205.9 billion at end-March 2025.

The unsecured portion of these loans decreased to HK$14.3 billion at end-June 2025 from HK$16.4 billion at end-March 2025.

The three-month delinquency ratio of RMLs in negative equity remained at a low level of 0.21 per cent at end-June 2025 as compared to 0.17per cent at end-March 2025.

It is important to note that the figures derived from this survey relate only to RMLs provided by authorized institutions on the basis of first mortgages and which the reporting institution knows to be in negative equity (i.e. the outstanding loan amount with the reporting institution exceeds the current market value of the mortgaged property). Not included in these figures are RMLs associated with co-financing schemes which would be in negative equity if the second mortgages were taken into account. The extent to which such RMLs are in negative equity is not known because authorized institutions do not maintain records on the outstanding balances of the second mortgages.

The mortgage portfolios of the surveyed authorized institutions represent about 99per cent of the industry total. The survey results have been extrapolated to estimate the position of the banking sector as a whole."

Among these, mortgage loans financing primary market transactions increased by 4.2per cent to HK$9.3 billion and those financing secondary market transactions increased by 2.4per cent to HK$15 billion. Mortgage loans for refinancing increased by 5.2per cent to HK$3.2 billion.

  Mortgage loans drawn down during June increased by 8.9per cent compared with May to HK$17.7 billion.

  The outstanding value of mortgage loans increased month-on-month by 0.1per cent to HK$1,885.6 billion at end-June.

  The mortgage delinquency ratio stood at a low level of 0.13per cent and the rescheduled loan ratio was unchanged at nearly 0per cent."

Advance estimates on Gross Domestic Product for second quarter of 2025,2025-07-31 16:30,2025-07-31 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100285.htm,"The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (July 31) the advance estimates on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the second quarter of 2025.

According to the advance estimates, GDP increased by 3.1% in real terms in the second quarter of 2025 over a year earlier, compared with the increase of 3.0% in the first quarter.

Analysed by major GDP component, private consumption expenditure increased by 1.9% in real terms in the second quarter of 2025 over a year earlier, as against the decrease of 1.2% in the first quarter.

Government consumption expenditure measured in national accounts terms recorded an increase of 2.5% in real terms in the second quarter of 2025 over a year earlier, compared with the increase of 0.9% in the first quarter.

Gross domestic fixed capital formation increased by 2.9% in real terms in the second quarter of 2025 over a year earlier, following the increase of 1.1% in the first quarter.

Over the same period, total exports of goods measured in national accounts terms recorded an increase of 11.5% in real terms over a year earlier, accelerated further from the growth of 8.4% in the first quarter. Imports of goods measured in national accounts terms grew by 12.7% in real terms in the second quarter of 2025, compared with the increase of 7.2% in the first quarter.

Exports of services rose further by 7.5% in real terms in the second quarter of 2025 over a year earlier, after the increase of 6.3% in the first quarter. Imports of services increased by 7.0% in real terms in the second quarter of 2025, compared with the increase of 4.7% in the first quarter.

On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison basis, GDP increased by 0.4% in real terms in the second quarter of 2025 when compared with the first quarter.

Commentary

A Government spokesman said that the Hong Kong economy continued to expand solidly in the second quarter of 2025, supported by strong exports performance and improved domestic demand. According to the advance estimates, real GDP grew by 3.1% over a year earlier, picking up slightly from the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, real GDP rose further by 0.4%.

Analysed by major expenditure component, total exports of goods saw accelerated growth, as the external demand was resilient and the temporary easing of US tariff measures led to some ""rush shipments"". Exports of services continued to expand notably, thanks to strong growth in inbound tourism, further expansion in cross-boundary traffic, and vibrant financial and related business service activities amid the buoyant local stock market. Domestically, private consumption expenditure resumed moderate growth after four consecutive quarters of decline, as supported by the stabilisation in the domestic consumption market. Meanwhile, overall investment expenditure increased further alongside the economic expansion.

The Hong Kong economy exhibited remarkable resilience in the first half of 2025. Looking ahead, steady economic growth in Asia, particularly in the Mainland, combined with the Government's various measures to bolster consumption sentiment, attract investment, diversify markets, and promote economic growth, will continue to provide steadfast support for various segments of the Hong Kong economy. Nevertheless, uncertainties in the external environment remain elevated. The US' renewed tariff hikes of late will exert pressure on global trade flows as well as its domestic economic activity and inflation. The uncertain pace of US interest rate cuts will also affect investment sentiment. Moreover, the ""rush shipment"" effect is expected to fade later this year. Hong Kong’s economic performance going forward will, to a certain extent, depend on how these factors evolve.

The revised figures on GDP and more detailed statistics for the second quarter of 2025, as well as the revised GDP forecast for 2025, will be released on August 15, 2025.

Exchange Fund Position at end-June 2025,2025-07-31 16:30,2025-07-31 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100516.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) today (July 31) published the unaudited financial position of the Exchange Fund at end-June 2025.

  The Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$194.4 billion in the first half of 2025. The main components were:


gains on bonds of HK$75.3 billion;
gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$22.9 billion;
gains on other equities of HK$27.4 billion;
positive currency translation effect of HK$56.8 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets (Note 1); and
gains on other investments of HK$12.0 billion (Note 2).


  Fees on placements by the Fiscal Reserves and placements by Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government funds and statutory bodies were HK$8.5 billion (Note 3) and HK$8.3 billion respectively in the first half of 2025, with the rate of fee payment at 4.4per cent for 2025.

  Total assets of the Exchange Fund stood at HK$4,297.1 billion at end-June 2025, an increase of HK$216.1 billion from the end of 2024. Accumulated surplus stood at HK$877.9 billion at end-June 2025.

  The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue,said, ""The global financial markets experienced significant volatility in the first half of 2025 due to escalating trade barriers and frictions, as well as intensifying geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. In particular, following the announcement of a series of aggressive tariff measures by the US Government in early April, the global financial markets underwent massive sell-offs, with the equity and bond markets experiencing sharp declines. The S&P 500 fell by roughly 12per cent over a few days since April 3. The 10-year US Treasury yield also surged by 50 basis points to around 4.5per cent within a week in April, registering the sharpest weekly change since the pandemic outbreak in 2020.

  As the US and major economies made progress in tariff negotiations, investor confidence stabilised and global equity markets rebounded. The Hong Kong equities also benefitted from capital inflows and the Hang Seng Index rose by about 20per cent in the first half. As for the bond market, the US Fed kept its monetary policy target unchanged in the first half of the year. Hence, US bond yields stayed at relatively high levels, generating good interest income for the Exchange Fund's bond portfolio.

  Against this backdrop, the Exchange Fund recorded a decent investment income in the first half of 2025, with positive returns across major asset classes of bonds, equities and alternative investments. The weakening of the US dollar against major currencies in the first half also resulted in significant positive currency translation effect on the Exchange Fund's assets.""

  He added, ""While the Exchange Fund achieved good returns in the first half of the year, the investment landscape in the second half remains highly uncertain. The uncertainty of US Government's economic and trade policies will affect international capital flows, as well as corporates' earnings and investment decisions. Any increase in trade frictions or deterioration in geopolitical situations may cause a slowdown in global economic growth, and may also trigger a sharp reversal of market optimism, bringing shocks to the financial markets. In addition, the pace of adjustments of the Fed's monetary policy and concerns over the US Government's debt servicing ability may also affect the performance of US dollar assets and the US dollar against other currencies. While a sizeable part of the Exchange Fund's investment income in the first half was from the positive foreign currency translation effect, these valuation changes are subject to fluctuations and may not be sustained in the second half of the year.

  In the face of the complex and volatile investment environment, the HKMA will continue to adhere to the principle of capital preservation first while maintaining long-term growth. We will continue to manage the Exchange Fund with prudence and flexibility, implement appropriate defensive measures, and maintain a high degree of liquidity. We will also continue our investment diversification to strive for higher long-term returns, and ensure that the Exchange Fund remains effective in achieving its purpose of maintaining monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong.""

Note 1: This is primarily the effect of translating foreign currency assets into Hong Kong dollar after deducting the portion for currency hedging.
Note 2: This is the valuation change of investments held by investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. This figure reflects the valuations at the end of March 2025. Valuation changes of these investments from April to June are not yet available.

  Expenditure and revenue from April to June 2025 amounted to HK$190 billion and HK$77.7 billion respectively, resulting in a deficit of HK$93.9 billion after taking into account HK$45.1 billion received from issuance of Government Bonds and repayment of HK$26.7 billion principal on Government Bonds.

  A Government spokesperson said that the deficit for the period was mainly due to the fact that some major types of revenue including salaries and profits taxes are mostly received towards the end of a financial year.

  The fiscal reserves stood at HK$560.4 billion as at June 30, 2025.

Provisional statistics of retail sales for June 2025,2025-07-31 16:30,2025-07-31 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100519.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released the latest figures on retail sales today (July 31).

  The value of total retail sales in June 2025, provisionally estimated at $30.1 billion, increased by 0.7% compared with the same month in 2024. The revised estimate of the value of total retail sales in May 2025 increased by 2.4% compared with a year earlier. For the first half of 2025, it was provisionally estimated that the value of total retail sales decreased by 3.3% compared with the same period in 2024.

  Of the total retail sales value in June 2025, online sales accounted for 8.5%. The value of online retail sales in that month, provisionally estimated at $2.5 billion, increased by 8.4% compared with the same month in 2024. The revised estimate of online retail sales in May 2025 decreased by 1.2% compared with a year earlier. For the first half of 2025, it was provisionally estimated that the value of online retail sales decreased by 0.4% compared with the same period in 2024.

  After netting out the effect of price changes over the same period, the provisional estimate of the volume of total retail sales in June 2025 decreased by 0.3% compared with a year earlier. The revised estimate of the volume of total retail sales in May 2025 increased by 1.9% compared with a year earlier. For the first half of 2025, the provisional estimate of the total retail sales decreased by 4.7% in volume compared with the same period in 2024.

  Analysed by broad type of retail outlet in descending order of the provisional estimate of the value of sales and comparing June 2025 with June 2024, the value of sales of jewellery, watches and clocks, and valuable gifts increased by 6.8%. This was followed by sales of other consumer goods not elsewhere classified (+7.2% in value); commodities in supermarkets (+0.4%); medicines and cosmetics (+6.0%); commodities in department stores (+5.7%); and optical shops (+1.0%).

  On the other hand, the value of sales of wearing apparel decreased by 4.3% in June 2025 over a year earlier. This was followed by sales of food, alcoholic drinks and tobacco (-1.5% in value); electrical goods and other consumer durable goods not elsewhere classified (-9.3%); motor vehicles and parts (-6.0%); fuels (-8.7%); furniture and fixtures (-16.3%); footwear, allied products and other clothing accessories (-7.2%); Chinese drugs and herbs (-2.0%); and books, newspapers, stationery and gifts (-4.7%).

  Based on the seasonally adjusted series, the provisional estimate of the value of total retail sales increased by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025 compared with the preceding quarter, while the provisional estimate of the volume of total retail sales increased by 2.7%.

Commentary

  A government spokesman said that retail sales showed signs of stabilisation in recent months. The value of total retail sales increased further by 0.7% in June 2025 over the year.

  Looking ahead, the spokesman said continued increase in employment earnings, buoyant local stock market, coupled with the Government's proactive efforts in promoting tourism and mega events and also enterprises' strenuous effort in providing more diversified experiences would provide support to the consumption sentiment in the domestic market and businesses of the retail sector.

Further information

  Table 1 presents the revised figures on value index and value of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet for May 2025 as well as the provisional figures for June 2025. The provisional figures on the value of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet as well as the corresponding year-on-year changes for the first half of 2025 are also shown.

  Table 2 presents the revised figures on value of online retail sales for May 2025 as well as the provisional figures for June 2025. The provisional figures on year-on-year changes for the first half of 2025 are also shown.

  Table 3 presents the revised figures on volume index of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet for May 2025 as well as the provisional figures for June 2025. The provisional figures on year-on-year changes for the first half of 2025 are also shown.

  Table 4 shows the movements of the value and volume of total retail sales in terms of the year-on-year rate of change for a month compared with the same month in the preceding year based on the original series, and in terms of the rate of change for a three-month period compared with the preceding three-month period based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The classification of retail establishments follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification (HSIC) Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into different industry classes.

  These retail sales statistics measure the sales receipts in respect of goods sold by local retail establishments and are primarily intended for gauging the short-term business performance of the local retail sector. Data on retail sales are collected from local retail establishments through the Monthly Survey of Retail Sales (MRS). Local retail establishments with and without physical shops are covered in MRS and their sales, both through conventional shops and online channels, are included in the retail sales statistics.

  The retail sales statistics cover consumer spending on goods but not on services (such as those on housing, catering, medical care and health services, transport and communication, financial services, education and entertainment) which account for over 50% of the overall consumer spending. Moreover, they include spending on goods in Hong Kong by visitors but exclude spending outside Hong Kong by Hong Kong residents. Hence they should not be regarded as indicators for measuring overall consumer spending.

  Users interested in the trend of overall consumer spending should refer to the data series of private consumption expenditure (PCE), which is a major component of the Gross Domestic Product published at quarterly intervals. Compiled from a wide range of data sources, PCE covers consumer spending on both goods (including goods purchased from all channels) and services by Hong Kong residents whether locally or abroad. Please refer to the C&SD publication ""Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure Component"" for more details.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey of Retail Sales"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080003&scode=530).

Exchange Fund Abridged Balance Sheet and Currency Board Account,2025-07-31 16:30,2025-07-31 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100524.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (July 31) that the total assets of the Exchange Fund amounted to HK$4,297.1billion as at June 30, 2025, HK$137.7 billion higher than that at the end of May 2025. Hong Kong dollar assets increased by HK$88.5 billion and foreign currency assets increased by HK$49.2 billion.

The rise in Hong Kong dollar assets was mainly due to the increase in Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued but not yet settled at month end. The rise in foreign currency assets was mainly due to interest income, mark-to-market revaluation of investments, and the proceeds from the issuance of Government Green Bonds, which were partly offset by the sale of US dollars under the Currency Board arrangements.

The Currency Board Account shows that the Monetary Base at the end of June 2025 was HK$2,120.2 billion, decreased by HK$4.7 billion, or 0.2 per cent, from the end of May 2025. The decline was mainly due to the purchase of HK dollars under the Currency Board arrangements, which was partly offset by increase in the outstanding amount of Certificates of Indebtedness and the amortisation of discount on Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued.

The amount of Backing Assets increased by HK$8.6 billion, or 0.4 per cent, to HK$2,364.8 billion at the end of June 2025. The increase was mainly attributable to interest income, mark-to-market revaluation of investments, and the issuance of Certificates of Indebtedness, which were partly offset by the sale of US dollars under the Currency Board arrangements. The Backing Ratio increased from 110.88per cent at the end of May 2025 to 111.54per cent at the end of June 2025.

二零二五年第二季本地生產總值預先估計數字,2025-07-31 16:30,2025-07-31 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100269.htm,"政府統計處今日（七月三十一日）發布二零二五年第二季的本地生產總值預先估計數字。

根據預先估計數字，二零二五年第二季本地生產總值較上年同期實質上升3.1%，而第一季的升幅為3.0%。

按本地生產總值各個主要組成部分分析，私人消費開支在二零二五年第二季與上年同期比較實質上升1.9%，而第一季則下跌1.2%。

按國民經濟核算定義計算的政府消費開支，在二零二五年第二季與上年同期比較錄得2.5%的實質升幅，而第一季的升幅為0.9%。

本地固定資本形成總額繼二零二五年第一季實質上升1.1%後，在第二季與上年同期比較上升2.9%。

同期，按國民經濟核算定義計算，貨品出口總額與上年同期比較錄得11.5%的實質升幅，升幅較第一季的8.4%進一步加快。按國民經濟核算定義計算，貨品進口在二零二五年第二季實質上升12.7%，而第一季的升幅為7.2%。

服務輸出繼二零二五年第一季實質上升6.3%後，在第二季與上年同期比較進一步上升7.5%。服務輸入在二零二五年第二季實質上升7.0%，而第一季的升幅為4.7%。

經季節性調整而作相連季度比較的本地生產總值，在二零二五年第二季較第一季實質上升0.4%。

評論

政府發言人表示，在出口表現強勁及本地需求改善的支持下，香港經濟在二零二五年第二季繼續穩健擴張。根據預先估計數字，實質本地生產總值按年增長3.1%，輕微高於上一季的增幅。經季節性調整後按季比較，實質本地生產總值進一步上升0.4%。

按主要開支組成部分分析，外部需求表現強韌，加上美國關稅措施暫時有所緩和帶動「搶出口」效應，整體貨物出口增長加快。受惠於訪港旅遊業強勁增長、跨境運輸量進一步擴張，以及金融及相關商業服務活動在本地股市暢旺下表現活躍，服務輸出繼續顯著擴張。本地方面，受本地消費市場回穩所支持，私人消費開支在連續四季下跌後恢復溫和增長。同時，整體投資開支隨着經濟擴張而進一步上升。

香港經濟在二零二五年上半年展現相當的韌性。展望未來，亞洲尤其是內地經濟持續穩步增長，加上政府多項提振消費氣氛、吸引投資、開拓多元化市場，以及推動經濟增長的措施，將會繼續為香港各個經濟環節提供堅實支持。然而，外圍環境不確定性依然高企。美國近日重啓加徵關稅，將對全球貿易流向、當地經濟活動及通脹增加壓力。美國減息步伐並不明朗亦會影響投資氣氛。此外，「搶出口」效應預期會在今年稍後時間消退。香港經濟往後的表現將在一定程度上取決於這些因素如何演變。

二零二五年第二季本地生產總值的修訂數字和更詳細的統計數字，以及二零二五年全年本地生產總值的修訂預測，將會在二零二五年八月十五日公布。

進一步資料

二零二四年第二季至二零二五年第二季本地生產總值及選定主要開支組成部分的按年實質變動百分率載於表1。

當獲得更多數據後，政府統計處會編製本地生產總值的修訂數字。二零二五年第二季的本地生產總值修訂數字及更詳細分項統計數字，將於二零二五年八月十五日在政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/scode250.html） 和《按開支組成部分劃分的本地生產總值》報告（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1030001&scode=250）公布。

外匯基金截至二○二五年六月底的財務狀況,2025-07-31 16:30,2025-07-31 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100517.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（七月三十一日）公布外匯基金截至二○二五年六月底未經審計的財務狀況。

外匯基金在二○二五年上半年錄得1,944億港元的投資收入，其主要組成部分包括︰


債券投資收益753億港元；
香港股票投資收益229億港元；
其他股票投資收益274億港元；
非港元資產外匯估值上調（註一）568億港元；及
其他投資收益（註二）120億港元。


二○二五年外匯基金支付予財政儲備存款與香港特別行政區政府基金及法定組織存款的息率為4.4%，上半年相關費用分別為85億港元（註三）及83億港元。

二○二五年六月底外匯基金的總資產為42,971億港元，較二○二四年底增加2,161億港元，而其累計盈餘為8,779億港元。

金管局總裁余偉文表示：「二○二五年上半年受到貿易壁壘和摩擦升溫，以及中東地緣政治緊張局勢惡化的影響，全球金融市場出現了顯著波動。尤其是在美國政府於四月初宣布一系列激進關稅措施後，全球金融市場出現大幅拋售，股市和債市均曾急劇下挫。標普500指數在四月三日起數天內一度下跌約12%。10年期美國國債收益率亦曾在四月一周內急升50個基點至約4.5厘，這一上升幅度是自二○二○年新冠疫情危機以來的最大單周變動。

隨着美國與主要經濟體在關稅問題上的磋商出現階段性進展，投資者信心回穩，全球股市回升。而受惠於資金流入港股，恒生指數上半年亦錄得了約20%的升幅。債市方面，美聯儲在上半年維持貨幣政策目標不變，美元債券收益率繼續處於較高水平，為外匯基金持有的債券組合帶來不錯的利息收入。

在此背景下，外匯基金在二○二五年上半年錄得不俗的投資收益，主要的資產類別如債券、股票和另類投資均錄得正回報。此外，美元兌主要貨幣在上半年走弱，亦為外匯基金資產帶來可觀的外匯估值上調。」

他續說：「儘管外匯基金在上半年取得了不俗的投資收益，但下半年的投資環境仍然非常不明朗。美國政府的經貿政策立場缺乏可預測性，在影響國際資本流動之餘，亦會影響企業的盈利和投資決策。如貿易摩擦和地緣政治局勢惡化，不但會令全球經濟增長放緩，亦可能觸發市場樂觀情緒在短時間內逆轉，引致金融市場的大幅波動。此外，美聯儲貨幣政策的調整步伐，以及市場對美國政府償還債務能力的關注，也可能影響美元資產以及美元兌其他貨幣的表現。而二○二五年上半年外匯基金的投資收益中，有相當一部分來自外匯估值的上調，但這些估值變化頻繁，未必能在下半年持續。

面對複雜多變的投資環境，金管局會繼續堅守『保本先行、長期增值』的原則，謹慎而靈活地管理外匯基金。我們會作出適當的防禦性部署，並維持高流動性，亦會持續多元化投資，致力提高外匯基金的長期投資回報，確保外匯基金能繼續有效維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。」

註一：主要為外幣資產在扣除匯率對沖部分後換算至港元所產生的估值變動。
註二：這是外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的投資的估值變動。有關數字反映二○二五年三月底的估值，尚未包括四至六月份的估值變動。
註三：未包括二○二五年度應支付予未來基金的款項。有關數字需待二○二五年的綜合息率確定後方可公布。"

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（七月三十一日）公布，截至二○二五年六月三十日，外匯基金總資產為42,971億港元，較二○二五年五月底增加1,377億港元，其中港元資產增加885億港元，外幣資產增加492億港元。

港元資產增加，主要是因為獲認購而未交收的外匯基金票據及債券的月底餘額增加。外幣資產增加，主要是因為利息收入、投資按市價重估及發行政府綠色債券所得的款項，但有關增幅因在貨幣發行局制度下出售美元而被部分抵銷。

貨幣發行局帳目顯示，二○二五年六月底的貨幣基礎為21,202億港元，較二○二五年五月底減少47億港元，減幅為0.2%。貨幣基礎減少，主要是由於在貨幣發行局制度下購買港元，但有關減幅因負債證明書總額增加及已發行外匯基金票據及債券的折價攤銷而被部分抵銷。

二○二五年六月底的支持資產總額增加86億港元至23,648億港元，增幅為0.4%。支持資產增加，主要是因為利息收入、投資按市價重估及發行負債證明書，但有關增幅因在貨幣發行局制度下出售美元而被部分抵銷。支持比率由二○二五年五月底的110.88%，上升至二○二五年六月底的111.54%。

HKMA's Response to US Fed's Interest Rate Decision,2025-07-31 16:10,2025-07-31 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100580.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Federal Open Market Committee of the United StatesFederal Reserve announced earlier today (July 31, Hong Kong time) after its two-day meeting that it had decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 4.25-4.5 per cent.

The policy decision is in line with market expectations. However, the market generally considers that the pace of future rate cuts remains uncertain, as it depends on US inflation and labour market data developments, as well as the impact of tariff measures and fiscal policy on US economic activities, which remains to be observed.

In Hong Kong, the monetary and financial markets have continued to operate in an orderly manner. Following the sizable inflows in early May, the supply of Hong Kong dollar funding became abundant. Subsequently, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate eased as the demand for Hong Kong dollar funding abated somewhat, while carry trades gained pace. Since late June, the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) has been triggered several times, with the latest triggering occurring during New York trading hours earlier this morning. As liquidity became less abundant after the weak-side CU triggering, Hong Kong dollar interbank rates increased moderately from low levels, although they remained at a distance below US dollar interest rates. The current Hong Kong dollar-US dollar interest rate differential continues to incentivise carry trades to sell Hong Kong dollars for US dollars, keeping the Hong Kong dollar trading near the 7.85 weak-side CU level. However, equity-related demand has been strong lately, providing some support to the Hong Kong dollar. Looking ahead, depending on Hong Kong dollar supply-demand dynamics, as well as other uncertain factors such as US monetary policy and interest rate trajectories, stock market sentiment, and global financial markets and fund flows, it is possible that the weak-side CU will be triggered again. In such a case, theHong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) would buy Hong Kong dollars and sell US dollars in accordance with the Linked Exchange Rate System. The Aggregate Balance would decline correspondently and Hong Kong dollar interbank rates would gradually increase.

The extent and pace of future US interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty, and the prevailing interest rate environment in Hong Kong may also evolve due to the various factors mentioned above. The public should be mindful of the possibility of an increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, and to properly manage the associated risks when making decisions about property purchase, investment or borrowing. The HKMA will continue to closely monitor market developments and maintain monetary and financial stability."

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on July 30 to noon today (July 31), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 139 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 154 862 samples of food imported from Japan (including 101 526 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 35 146 samples of local catch respectively.

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由七月三十日中午截至今日（七月三十一日）中午，食安中心已對139個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

政府將收回686幅涉及面積約26公頃的私人土地及252幅涉及面積約8.6公頃的私人土地地層。上述土地將於收回土地公告張貼後三個月（即二○二五年十一月一日）復歸政府所有。政府會在土地復歸政府後，向相關土地業權人發放特惠土地補償及處理相關法定補償申索。

土地復歸日期是指土地業權轉歸政府的日期，並非受影響住戶及業務經營者須遷出的限期。按照工程時間表，在受影響住戶和業務經營者遷出限期前三個月，地政總署會另行按照適用程序在相關範圍張貼公告，現時預計受影響的住戶和業務經營者最早須由二○二六年年初開始遷出。政府會與相關土地業權人和受影響人士保持緊密溝通，妥善處理他們的補償和安置事宜。

政府早前與香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵公司）簽訂北環線項目（包括北環線主線和支線）的第一部分項目協議，啓動北環線主線項目當中較成熟和較迫切的工程，並同時要求港鐵公司同步進行北環線支線的詳細規劃及設計，包括相關法定程序。北環線主線將成為北部都會區多個新發展區的公共運輸骨幹，並會連接現有的屯馬線及東鐵線，形成貫通新界和九龍市區的環狀鐵路，大大提升鐵路網絡的覆蓋範圍和韌性，同時釋放北部都會區的發展潛力。北環線支線則會作為北環線項目的跨境分支，連通香港和深圳的地鐵網絡，同時兼備香港本地通勤和跨境鐵路服務的功能。"

The authorised railway scheme of the NOL Main Line involves a 10.7-kilometre underground railway connecting the existing Kam Sheung Road Station of the Tuen Ma Line and the Kwu Tung Station under construction on the East Rail Line, with three intermediate stations at Au Tau, Ngau Tam Mei and San Tin.

  In all, 686 private lots with a total area of about 26 hectares as well as an underground strata of 252 private lots with a total area of about 8.6 hectares will be resumed by the Government. The said land will revert to the Government upon the expiry of a period of three months from the date of affixing the land resumption notices (i.e. November 1, 2025). The Government will release ex-gratia land compensation to the relevant land owners and handle relevant statutory claims for compensation after the land reversion.

The land reversion date is the date of vesting of the ownership of the land in the Government. It is not the departure deadline of the affected households and business undertakings. According to the project programme, the Lands Department will post notices in relevant areas in accordance with the applicable procedures about three months before the departure deadlines of the affected households and business undertakings. It is estimated that the affected households and business undertakings will have to move out starting from early 2026 at the earliest. The Government will closely liaise with the relevant land owners and affected parties, and properly handle their compensation and rehousing matters.

The Government has earlier executed the Part1 Project Agreement of the NOL Project (comprising both the NOL Main Line and the NOL Spur Line) with the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) to commence works on the NOL Main Line that are more ready and time-critical, and also required the MTRCL to carry out the detailed planning and design of the NOL Spur Line including relevant statutory procedures in parallel. The NOL Main Line would become the public transportation backbone for multiple new development areas in the Northern Metropolis and connect the existing Tuen Ma Line and East Rail Line, forming a railway loop linking the New Territories and the Kowloon urban area. This will substantially enhance the coverage and resilience of the railway network and also unleash the development potential of the Northern Metropolis. The NOL Spur Line, as a cross-boundary bifurcation of the NOL Project, would connect the metro networks of Hong Kong and Shenzhen, offering both local commuting functions within Hong Kong as well as cross-boundary railway services."

CFS announces test results of targeted surveillance on nutrition labelling of prepackaged sauce,2025-07-31 15:00,2025-07-31 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100388.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (July 31) released the test results of a targeted food surveillance project on the nutrition labelling of prepackaged sauce. Among 40 samples tested, including food items purchased online, one sample was found with protein content inconsistent with the declared value on its nutrition label, while the remaining 39 samples passed the test.

""The CFS collected samples from different retail outlets for the targeted food surveillance project. Tests were conducted to check if the energy content and specified nutrient content (total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, sugars, sodium, protein, carbohydrates, and more) are consistent with the declared values on their nutrition labels. The food labels were also checked to see if they comply with relevant requirements under the laws,"" a spokesman for the CFS said.

The CFS has announced the irregularity in the actual nutrient content earlier. The vendor concerned has also stopped selling the relevant batches of the affected product. Prosecution will be instituted should there be sufficient evidence.

The Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) Regulations (Cap. 132W) require all applicable prepackaged foods to list the ingredients and the content of energy plus seven core nutrients, namely carbohydrates, protein, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, sodium and sugars, and regulate any associated nutrition claims.

Nutrition labelling can assist consumers in making informed food choices, encourage food manufacturers to apply sound nutrition principles in the formulation of foods, and regulate misleading or deceptive labels and claims. According to Section 61 of the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132), if any person falsely describes food or misleads as to the nature, substance or quality of the food on a label of the food sold by him or her, he or she shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and six months' imprisonment upon conviction.

The CFS will continue to conduct surveillance on other food samples to check if their energy content and specified nutrient content are consistent with the declared values on their nutrition labels, and the results will be released in due course. The spokesman reminded the food trade to comply with the law, and urged members of the public to pay attention to the information on nutrition labels when purchasing food to make informed food choices to achieve a balanced diet and stay healthy."
CFS announces food safety report for June,2025-07-31 15:00,2025-07-31 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100198.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (July 31) released the findings of its food safety report for last month. The results of about 6 700 food samples tested (including food items purchased online) were found to be satisfactory except for eight unsatisfactory samples that were announced earlier. The overall satisfactory rate was 99.9 per cent.

A CFS spokesman said that about 2 100 food samples were collected for microbiological tests, and about 4 600 samples were taken for chemical and radiation level tests.

The microbiological tests covered pathogens and hygiene indicators; the chemical tests included testing for pesticides, preservatives, metallic contaminants, colouring matters, veterinary drug residues and others; and the radiation-level tests included testing for radioactive caesium and iodine in samples collected from imported food from different regions.

The samples comprised about 1 800 samples of vegetables and fruit and their products; about 500 samples of cereals, grains and their products; about 700 samples of meat and poultry and their products; about 1 100 samples of milk, milk products and frozen confections; about 1 100 samples of aquatic and related products; and about 1 500 samples of other food commodities (including beverages, bakery products and snacks).

The eight unsatisfactory samples comprised a prepackaged frozen giant scarlet shrimp sample detected with a metallic contaminant exceeding the legal limit, a prepackaged black pepper sample found to contain a pesticide, ethylene oxide, a Chinese lettuce sample and a banana sample detected with pesticide residues exceeding the legal limits, two ice cream samples detected with coliform bacteria counts exceeding the legal limits, a soft ice-cream sample detected with a total bacterial count exceeding the legal limit, and a frozen confection sample detected with coliform bacteria and total bacterial counts exceeding the legal limits.

The CFS has taken follow-up actions on the above-mentioned unsatisfactory samples, including informing the vendors concerned of the test results, instructing them to stop selling the affected food items, and tracing the sources of the food items in question.

The spokesman reminded the food trade to ensure that food is fit for human consumption and meets legal requirements. Consumers should patronise reliable shops when buying food and maintain a balanced diet to minimise food risks.

Separately, in response to the Japanese Government's discharge of nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the CFS will continue enhancing the testing on imported Japanese food, and make reference to the risk assessment results to adjust relevant surveillance work in a timely manner. The CFS will announce every working day on its dedicated webpage (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/daily_japan_nuclear_incidents.html) the radiological test results of the samples of food imported from Japan, with a view to enabling the trade and members of the public to have a better grasp of the latest safety information."

Speech by DCS at BOC Life 10th Golden Age Expo and Summit Grand Opening (English only)(with photos),2025-07-31 14:15,2025-07-31 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100455.htm,"Following is the speech by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing,at the BOC Life 10th Golden Age Expo and Summit Grand Opening this morning (July 31):

Dr Yasuko Arase (Deputy Mayor, Fukuoka City, Japan),Dr Roy Chung (Honorary President, Golden Age Foundation, Founder and Chairman, Bright Future Charitable Foundation), Mr Wilson Tang (Chief Executive Officer, BOC Group Life Assurance Company Limited),Dr Donald Li (Chairman of Elderly Commission), Professor Rebecca Choy Yung (Founder and Chair of Golden Age Foundation), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you today at the grand opening of the 10th Golden Age Expo and Summit.

I would like to thank the Golden Age Foundation for your meaningful contribution to our community. Over the past decade, this flagship event has established itself as a vital platform for fostering collaboration between the public and private sectors. I learned that the last edition in 2024 saw a record-breaking attendance of over 40 000 from around the globe. Such enthusiastic participation is strong evidence of the enormous potential of silver economy. This year's theme, ""A Decade of Innovation: From Silver to Gold"", further underscores the transformative journey we have embarked on using innovation to confront the complexities of an ageing society.

Like many highly-developed regions worldwide, Hong Kong is experiencing rapid growth in our elderly population. By 2043, more than one-third of our population will be elderly, creating a tremendous demand for silver products and services in personal care and healthcare, food and beverages, leisure and recreation, financial services, etc. Promoting silver economy not only enhances the quality of life of our elderly, but also creates new impetus for the growth of Hong Kong's economy through emerging industries and businesses.

To this end, in his 2024 Policy Address, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong announced the establishment of a Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy (the Working Group) chaired by me. In May this year, the Working Group announced 30 measures across five areas, namely: boosting ""silver consumption"", developing ""silver industry"", promoting ""quality assurance of silver products"", enhancing ""silver financial and security arrangements"" and unleashing ""silver productivity"".

In terms of boosting ""silver consumption"", the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB) of our Government has been working with the trade and stakeholders to attract more silver consumption through exhibitions and retail concessions, electronic commerce and catering initiatives. Amongst various exhibitions, this signature exhibition is certainly one of the largest in Hong Kong, showcasing the latest smart ageing technologies, innovative products and services from 200 exhibitors. I am sure that our attendees today can reap the fruits of the business sector's efforts in providing products and services to better meet the elderly's needs and preference.

To tap the huge potential of the senior food catering market, with CEDB's support, several large local restaurant chains have introduced various items of Care Food/soft meals recently and have received encouraging response from the market. I am glad that a number of exhibitors here today are also promoting their Care Food products. The HKSAR Government will continue to work closely with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service and relevant stakeholders to raise the community's awareness of Care Food.

Building a resilient and inclusive financial ecosystem that helps optimise Hong Kong residents' wealth accumulation is important in fostering a thriving silver economy. Echoing the Working Group's measures on enhancing ""silver financial and security arrangements"", I am delighted to note that there will be a dedicated discussion session on ""Unlocking Opportunities in the silver economy: financial planning; savings and insurance decisions; investment strategies wealth and estate management"" at this year's Expo and Summit, and my colleague from the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau will talk about the Government's efforts on this front.

Developing silver economy spans across a wide spectrum, from age-friendly designs, medical financing arrangements to gerontechnology. Therefore, we need the support of the entire community, including the business sector, social leaders and the academia, to join hands in accomplishing this mission. I am confident that the insight, experience and best practices shared by more than 100 influential thinkers and leaders at this Expo and Summit will inspire concrete actions and drive positive changes.

As we celebrate the 10th anniversary of this remarkable event, I thank the Golden Age Foundation once again for organising this visionary summit for our golden and silver agers. I wish the 10th Golden Age Expo and Summit tremendous success, and look forward to seeing innovative solutions and collaborations coming out from this platform. For those of you from the Mainland and overseas, may I also wish you a pleasurable stay in Hong Kong. Thank you very much."
Hospital Authority streamlines clinical research approval to promote medical research development (with photo),2025-07-31 14:00,2025-07-31 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100376.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

  The Hospital Authority (HA) held a sharing session today (July 31) with representatives from the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute (GBAICTI) and Hong Kong's pharmaceutical industry to outline a series of enhancement measures implemented by the HA for promoting clinical research development, including the recently implemented streamlined approval procedures aiming at attracting more clinical research projects from the industry.

  Last year, the HA established a Central Clinical Research and Innovation Office and Cluster Clinical Research Support Offices in each cluster to provide support for frontline healthcare professionals and proactively encourage participation in clinical research. In April this year, the HA further enhanced the application and approval procedures for commercially sponsored clinical research, including revising the long-standing standard clinical research agreement template to provide more up-to-date content and balance the interests of all parties. The HA has also engaged a professional organisation to assist in the review and approval of commercially sponsored clinical research applications, expediting the approval process and timeframe through the incorporation of industry expertise.

  The Director (Quality and Safety) of the HA, Dr Michael Wong, expressed confidence that the new measures will promote the clinical research development. ""As a key player in local clinical research with professional medical teams and extensive healthcare data, the HA has been aligning with government policies and engaging in communication and exchange with various healthcare institutions and industry stakeholders. Through optimising processes and streamlining approval procedures, the HA aims to facilitate efficient implementation and execution of clinical research, fostering a more conducive environment for medical innovation and enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness in international clinical research.""

  About 100 participants in the sharing session included members and representatives from the GBAICTI and the Hong Kong Association of the Pharmaceutical Industry, who had in-depth exchanges on the development of clinical research in Hong Kong.

  The HA Central Institutional Review Board (Central IRB) completed the integration of all cluster Research Ethics Committees in March 2024 and has processed over 1 000 clinical research applications. The Central IRB serves as a co-ordinator and has been further streamlining the research ethics application and approval process and facilitating cross-cluster clinical research applications. Following process optimisation, simple clinical research applications can now be processed through an expedited review procedure, with approval times significantly reduced to within 30 days, while the ethics review for complex research applications can be completed within 60 days.

  The HA will continue to dovetail with government policy directions and the needs of the pharmaceutical industry, deepen collaboration with the GBAICTI, and fully support various clinical research applications, thereby promoting Hong Kong's medical and scientific research, enhancing healthcare standards, and benefitting patients."

Government revises eligibility criteria for government-subsidised post-secondary student places and subsidies,2025-07-31 13:30,2025-07-31 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100290.htm,"  The Government today (July 31) announced the revision of the eligibility criteria for government-subsidised post-secondary student places and subsidies: introducing two categories of tuition fees and revising the eligibility criteria. The revision will apply to the 2027/28 academic year and thereafter (the application cycle for the 2027/28 academic year commencing in October 2026). This will allow the affected persons reasonable time to make their own plans and the Joint University Programmes Admissions System (JUPAS) Office and the admissions offices of various institutions (including the University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities, the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, and the Vocational Training Council) sufficient time to make corresponding administrative arrangements.

 A Government spokesperson said, ""Under the current admissions arrangements, dependant visa/entry permit holders who were below 18 years old when first issued with such visa/entry permit by the Immigration Department (ImmD) are considered local students. There has been recent concern that some of these students did not come to reside in Hong Kong but applied for government-subsidised student places at UGC-funded universities as local students, which affected opportunities for university admission and the targeted use of public funds.

  ""To clarify the eligibility criteria for government-subsidised post-secondary student places and subsidies, and to ensure the proper use of public funds, the Education Bureau, having regard to overseas practices and the practical situation in Hong Kong, considers it necessary for dependant children to reside in Hong Kong for two years before becoming eligible for government-subsidised post-secondary student places. Holders of a full-time employment visa/work permit or a visa/entry permit for various admission schemes will no longer be eligible for government-subsidised post-secondary student places.""

  Two categories of tuition fees are introduced under the revision. Category I refers to subsidised fees. Persons holding the following documents are eligible for government-subsidised student places in relation to sub-degree, undergraduate and taught postgraduate programmes:


A Hong Kong permanent identity card, other documents issued by the ImmD showing the right to land/right of abode in Hong Kong, and a visa label for unconditional stay;
A One-way Permit for entry to Hong Kong; and
A dependant visa/entry permit: holders who were below 18 years old when first issued with such visa/entry permit by the ImmD, provided that they have resided in Hong Kong for two years immediately preceding the first day of their respective programmes. Regarding first-year student places, to facilitate institutions'admissions procedures, the two-year period will be specified appropriately by the JUPAS office or the institutions concerned having regard to the first day of the respective programmes. Whether the residency requirement is met is determined at or before the start of each academic yearand shall remain the same for the remainder of that academic year. The first day of the academic year of a programme is determined by the programme's start day.


  Category II refers to non-subsidised fees and applies to persons not meeting the eligibility criteria in the above-mentioned Category I. These persons include:


Dependant visa/entry permit holders who were below 18 years old when first issued with such visa/entry permit by the ImmD, and they do not meet the two-year residency requirement;
Holders of a full-time employment visa/work permit;
Holders of a visa/entry permit for various admission schemes (including the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, the Capital Investment Entrant Scheme or the Admission Scheme for the Second Generation of Chinese Hong Kong Permanent Residents); and
Non-local students (such as holders of a student visa/entry permit; holders of a visa/entry permit under the Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates; dependant visa/entry permit holders who were 18 years old or above when first issued with such visa/entry permit by the ImmD).


  Category II persons may still apply for government-subsidised sub-degree, undergraduate and taught postgraduate programmes but have to pay non-subsidised fees. The institutions may determine appropriate non-subsidised fee levels, following the established principles, having regard to their own circumstances and programme costs, and taking a holistic view of various factors. The levels have to be at least sufficient to recover all additional direct costs, and to be on par with those applicable to non-local students.

  The Government will put in place a transitional arrangement for the above-mentioned revision, whereby the residency requirement for the 2027/28 academic year (its application cycle commencing in October 2026) will be set at one year. The two-year residency requirement will be implemented starting from the 2028/29 academic year.

 The spokesperson said, ""When formulating the revision, the Government fully listened to various views in society and struck the right balance. The revision is not expected to have a significant impact on families with genuine intentions to come to Hong Kong for development.""

 Regarding the residency requirement for JUPAS applications for government-subsidised first-year-first-degree student places, applicants are required to provide the following proof:

(a) proof from the applicant that he or she is enrolled as a full-time student in a school offering a formal curriculum in Hong Kong for the two-year period ending on May 31 in the year in which his or her respective programme begins; or

(b) for those who cannot provide the proof in (a) above, a statement of travel records of the applicant which can be obtained at a fee from the ImmD covering the two-year period to demonstrate that the applicant is not absent from Hong Kong for a maximum of 90 days in each year of the two-year period.

  Regarding other government-subsidised post-secondary student places, including those in relation to sub-degree, senior year undergraduate and taught postgraduate programmes of UGC-funded universities, the relevant institutions are required to process the applications in an approach similar to the above-mentioned one.

  The eligibility criteria and related arrangements for government scholarship, fellowship or subsidy schemes which are currently premised on the definitions of ""local students"" and ""non-local students"" (such as the Hong Kong Future Talents Scholarship Scheme for Advanced Studies, the Tuition Waiver for Local Research Postgraduate Students, the Study Subsidy Scheme for Designated Professions/Sectors, and the Non-means-tested Subsidy Scheme for Self-financing Undergraduate Studies in Hong Kong) will also be correspondingly revised to ensure consistency."

立法會：商務及經濟發展局副局長就「積極拓展香港新經濟增長點」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-07-31 13:03,2025-07-31 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100389.htm,"以下是商務及經濟發展局（商經局）副局長陳百里博士今日（七月三十一日）在立法會會議上，就「積極拓展香港新經濟增長點」議員議案的總結發言：

主席：

我再次感謝容海恩議員提出的動議，田北辰議員、陳曼琪議員和李浩然議員提出的修正案，以及其他共41位議員就積極拓展香港新經濟增長點的寶貴建議。以下我會作綜合回應。

加強內聯外通、招商引資

首先，我留意到很多議員都希望政府加強內聯外通方面的工作，以及進一步向海內外宣傳我們方方面面的優勢，說好香港故事。

事實上，政府一直透過不同措施提升香港的國際競爭力和吸引力。在《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港整體排名晉身全球首三位最具競爭力的經濟體，在「商業法規」和「稅務政策」排名更是全球第一。今次是自二○一九年後，香港首次重返全球三甲，顯示政府的施政方向整體正確，各項政策取得了成效。尤其在招商引資方面，在二○二三年至二○二五年上半年期間，投資推廣署已協助約1300間企業在港開設或擴展業務，預計帶來直接投資額超過1,600億元，並在有關企業設立或擴展業務的首年，合共創造超過19 000個職位。以上數字已超越二○二二年《施政報告》所訂的績效指標。我們會繼續加強宣傳香港的獨特優勢及新經濟增長點帶來的機遇。

而在深化與內地的聯繫方面，因應內地市場對香港的專業服務需求日漸增加，政府會繼續把握《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》（CEPA）下內地給予香港的優惠措施，助力香港企業和專業人才為內地市場提供優質產品和服務。例如，在CEPA框架下簽訂的《修訂協議二》增加了「港資港法」和「港資港仲裁」作為便利香港投資者的措施，正好支持在粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）試點城市註冊的港資企業。此外，大灣區市場在多個範疇以先行先試的方式對香港作更大程度開放，讓香港服務提供者在大灣區市場提供更多樣化的專業服務，為香港企業和專業人士，以及外來投資者帶來新商機。

在深化與國際市場的聯繫方面，儘管海外市場經濟放緩、地緣政治帶來衝擊、美國的不合理關稅措施等帶來不少挑戰和不明朗因素，政府正積極透過多元化措施開拓新興市場，鞏固香港作為國際貿易中心的地位。自二○二二年上任後，行政長官先後五次率領高級別商貿代表團兩度出訪中東和三度出訪東南亞國家聯盟（東盟），為香港開拓商機及加強與這些經濟體的關係。這些訪問成果非常理想，與東盟各國不同單位簽署接近90份合作備忘錄和協議，涉及範疇廣泛。政府會繼續加強相關工作，積極開拓新經濟增長點。另外，香港會繼續擔當好作為「一帶一路」功能平台的角色，為國家推動共建「一帶一路」作出貢獻。香港將於今年迎來「一帶一路高峰論壇」十周年，論壇訂於今年九月十日至十一日舉行。我們已主動聯繫相關機構和組織，鼓勵它們於論壇前後舉辦與「一帶一路」相關活動以加強協同效應，說好國家及香港故事。

升級轉型、推動創新

剛才，很多議員都提到政府要加大力度幫助業界升級轉型、推動創新。就這一方面，政府正推出多項措施推動高增值產業發展。為進一步推進新型工業化發展，政府已推出一系列支援計劃，包括「新型工業加速計劃」、「新型工業化資助計劃」，支持策略性產業的企業在香港設立新智能生產設施，利用創科升級轉型，轉向智能製造。政府除了將於今年內推出先導計劃為本地製造業提供配對資助，鼓勵業界引入智能生產升級轉型生產線外，亦將設立「創科產業引導基金」，加強引導市場資金投資指定策略性新興及未來產業，系統性建設創科產業生態圈。我們期望透過以上措施促進科技創新與產業創新融合發展，引領香港更好地融入國家產業創新體系。

我亦聽到議員在太空經濟方面的意見和建議，除了在開場發言所提及的措施外，政府亦希望將科研投入成果化，其中InnoHK旗下香港太空機械人與能源中心的研究成果將直接應用於嫦娥八號探月任務，成為中國牽頭建立國際月球科研站先行計劃的重要組成部分，為國家的航天發展作出貢獻。就低軌衞星的工作方面，政府希望經簡化的申請制度能吸引投資、人才和企業以香港作為發展低軌衞星業務的基地。

促進金融創新、締造領先地位

剛才亦有好幾位議員提到促進金融創新。在這方面，政府正就數字資產交易服務提供者和數字資產託管服務提供者發牌制度的立法建議諮詢公眾，諮詢期至八月底。參考公眾意見及市場發展，政府會訂定相關發牌制度的細節，秉持「相同業務、相同風險、相同規則」的原則，促進香港數字資產市場健康、負責任和可持續發展。

利用自身優勢、打造產業多元化

另外，多位議員都提及香港要利用自身優勢、打造產業多元化。事實上，香港絕對有條件利用自身在金融、貿易、專業服務、文化、旅遊、體育、教育等的優勢，配合外來機遇，專門發展有長遠潛力的範疇。

就發展伊斯蘭市場方面，現時本港的金融市場有各種伊斯蘭金融產品及服務，香港金融管理局與沙特阿拉伯公共投資基金簽署諒解備忘錄，共同出資支持創設一項目標規模達10億美元的新投資基金，促進與香港和大灣區有聯繫的企業在沙特當地發展。政府將繼續推展伊斯蘭市場有關金融、經貿及旅遊發展的工作，全方位把握伊斯蘭市場的各種機遇。

在專業認證服務方面，政府會持續提升相關部門的能力，並向業界提供優質的認可服務及推出新認可服務。政府部門亦會善用本港檢測認證業界的專業服務，從而確認市面上的產品及服務符合相關標準，例如議員提及的中藥或白酒等，以保障消費者的利益和安全。

在綠色產業方面，為達致經濟及環境雙贏發展，我們會透過善用已修復堆填區，以及相關科研及技術示範基金等，協助企業在香港推展綠色科技項目。政府正協助兩間本地綠色創科公司設立生產線，利用本地回收廢料，分別升級再造高價值的無電製冷及創冷產品的核心原料，以及高增值的聲學超材料產品。我們會繼續吸引和協助企業在香港發展綠色科技項目，打造香港成為綠色科技示範基地，助力國家輸出綠色科技及產品，爭取國際市場認可及強化競爭優勢。另一方面，政府亦會積極拓寬綠色金融科技生態圈，包括透過資助計劃推動有潛力的綠色金融科技方案於香港的商業環境中更廣泛應用。

在文化創意產業方面，政府會繼續積極落實《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，完善文藝創意產業生態圈。政府已公布改革表演場地的預訂政策，當中包括香港體育館定位由體育優先改為演唱會優先，助力發展演唱會經濟。政府亦會繼續策略性地發掘和支持具產業化潛力的香港文創項目，讓香港的創作「走出去」，同時推進與內地文創品牌的合作，善用內地機遇。

在體育產業方面，政府會把握好啟德體育園的機遇。這兩個星期舉行的「香港足球盛會2025」正好見證世界級足球隊在啟德主場館作賽，不但在社會營造熾熱的體育氛圍，更吸引內地與世界各地遊客訪港觀賽，帶動消費。今年十一月至十二月，香港將與廣東和澳門首次共同承辦第十五屆全國運動會及全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會，預計將吸引超過10萬人次旅客來港觀賽，直接帶動旅遊、餐飲住宿和零售等消費。我們將充分善用這項國家盛事，配合不同的旅遊產品，吸引更多內地和海外遊客來港，進一步提升體育及旅遊的協同效應和相關經濟效益。

在教育產業方面，政府會繼續舉辦國際教育會議及展覽，突顯香港作為國際專上教育樞紐的地位。我們會加強在全球推廣「留學香港」品牌，吸引更多優秀境外學生。政府亦已推出新一輪批地計劃及開辦課程貸款計劃，以象徵式地價批出土地及提供免息貸款，支持自資院校擴容提質。

至於就寵物經濟的建議，相關部門會在今年下旬進行住戶飼養寵物主題性統計調查，從而收集香港家庭飼養寵物的相關數據。調查結果將有助業界了解飼養寵物的最新趨勢，讓商界朋友按市場需求提供產品和服務。

結語

主席，推動經濟發展有賴官、商、民通力合作。今日我很感謝各位議員提出非常有建設性的建議，商經局和其他政策局定必仔細考慮。政府會繼續為香港企業創造有利條件，把握發展機遇，提升香港的競爭力及國際影響力，配合國家戰略發展方向。主席，我謹此陳辭。"

HKTE revamps website to enable talent's convenient search for information (with photo),2025-07-31 13:00,2025-07-31 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100234.htm,"  Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE) revamped its website (www.hkengage.gov.hk) today (July 31), enabling outside talent to efficiently and precisely search for practical information on talent admission schemes, settling in Hong Kong and career development, and promoting Hong Kong's unique advantages and opportunities to attract more international talent to pursue development in the city.

  The revamped website features a new interface with core themes of ""Work"", ""Live"" and ""Thrive"". Key enhanced features include:

(1) an expanded guide to living in Hong Kong to cover 18 categories, including education, healthcare, taxation, etc;

(2) a new dedicated page for HKTE activities, providing one-stop registration services;

(3) an enhanced recruitment platform network; and

(4) the introduction of a chatbot function, providing instant feedback to enquiries from talent.

  The revamped website also provides detailed information about Hong Kong's unique advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle of having the strong support of the country while maintaining unparalleled connectivity with the world, as well as positioning for the development of the ""eight centres"", to attract international high-calibre talent to Hong Kong to seize development opportunities.

  A spokesman for HKTE stated that the revamped website has optimised the user's experience, with clearer categorisation and key information at a glance under a new interface to create a more user-friendly platform for outside talent to obtain information, providing them with the strongest support in pursuing their development in Hong Kong.

  In addition, HKTE has revamped its logo to align with the three core themes of the revamped website. The new logo incorporates the colours of the themes to highlight vibrancy and creativity, symbolising talent settling and thriving in Hong Kong while embracing opportunities."
金管局回應美聯儲議息決定,2025-07-31 12:32,2025-07-31 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100394.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

美國聯邦儲備局（美聯儲）聯邦公開市場委員會經過一連兩天的會議後，在香港時間今日（七月三十一日）清晨公布維持聯邦基金利率目標區間於4.25-4.5厘。

美聯儲維持息率不變的決定符合市場預期。然而，市場普遍認為美聯儲未來的減息步伐仍然存在較大的不確定性，視乎美國通脹和就業數據的走勢，其中關稅措施以及財政政策等對經濟活動的影響尚有待觀察。

香港方面，貨幣及金融市場保持有序運作。港元供應在五月初強勁資金流入後保持充裕，其後市場對港元需求有所減少，套息交易令港匯走弱。六月底以來，港匯數度觸發「弱方兌換保證」，而最近一次是在今晨紐約交易時段觸發。港元流動性逐漸縮減，港元拆息從低位溫和上升，但仍顯著低於美息。目前港美息差對套息交易仍具吸引力，因此令港匯繼續貼近7.85水平，但與此同時，近日股票相關的港元資金需求甚殷，為港匯提供一定支持。往後視乎港元資金供求變化，以及其他不確定因素包括美聯儲貨幣政策和美息走向、股票投資市場氣氛、外圍金融市場及環球資金流向等，「弱方兌換保證」可能會再度被觸發。屆時金管局將按照聯匯制度買入港元沽出美元，銀行體系總結餘將相應下降，而港元拆息將會逐步上升。

美國未來減息的幅度和步伐存在頗大的不確定性，而香港目前的利率環境因為上述各種變數亦可能出現變化，市民在作出置業、投資或借貸決定時，需充分考慮港元息率上升的可能性，並管理相關風險。金管局會繼續密切監察市場變化，維持貨幣及金融穩定。"

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

The case involved unauthorised building works (UBWs) in a unit of a residential building at Tai Kok Tsui Road, including the erection of a structure of about 90 square metres on the flat roof, and the installation of three metal gates obstructing the means of escape. As the UBWs were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failure to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (July 31), ""Unauthorised building works may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."
LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-31 11:20,2025-07-31 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100330.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference.

Director of Health meets Director General of Guangzhou Municipal Health Commission to deepen collaboration between Guangzhou and Hong Kong on communicable disease prevention and control (with photo),2025-07-30 21:52,2025-07-30 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000840.htm,"The Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, today (July 30) led representatives of the department to meet with Director General of the Guangzhou Municipal Health Commission, Ms Chen Bin, in Guangzhou to learn about the latest situation of Chikungunya fever (CF) in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou and the disease prevention measures, as well as share the emergency preparedness adopted in Hong Kong, to deepen thecollaboration between Guangzhou and Hong Kong on disease prevention and control.

""Thanks to the support of the National Health Commission and the Health Commission of Guangdong Province, the joint prevention and control measures of CF fully demonstrates the continuous and deepening co-operation between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao on prevention and control, and emergency response for communicable diseases. Owing to the communicable disease notification mechanism established by the three places, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) has kept abreast of the latest situation of CF in Guangdong Province. To enhance co-operation among professional staff and strengthen experience sharing in epidemic prevention and control, the DH has sent two field epidemiology doctors to join the Foshan Center of Disease Control and Prevention to conduct local epidemiological investigation and epidemic control, including mosquito surveillance, anti-mosquito operations in the community and management of patients, to gain invaluable experience on prevention and control of CF,"" said Dr Lam.

To further understand the latest epidemic prevention and control situation and measures, the DH has also sent a Principal Medical and Health Officer in the field of epidemiology from the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP to visit Foshan this afternoon to exchange views on prevention measures on CF with the staff members of the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration and Foshan Center of Disease Control and Prevention.

The recent spike in CF cases in multiple regions worldwide (including neighbouring areas), and more frequently travelling among members of the public during summer holidays, pose an extremely high risk of imported cases in Hong Kong. The Government has been gearing up for emergency preparedness in response to the possible imported cases of CF, and intensifying publicity and health education across all fronts.

Public Education

The CHP will hold an online live seminar on its Facebook page from 8.30pm to 9pm tomorrow (July 31), to provide the latest information and health advices on CF, and respond to related enquiries from the public. Members of public are welcome to attend.

The CHP has set up mobile promotional booths at multiple locations across Hong Kong (including public markets, community health centres, and shopping malls) to educate the public on how to prevent mosquito-borne diseases. Details can be viewed atwww.chp.gov.hk/en/other/events/476.html.

Members of the public may visit the CF webpage of the CHP and Travel Health Service for the latest information and health advice.

Forum for the industry

The Infection Control Branch of the CHP and the Infectious Disease Control Training Centre of the Hospital Authority jointly organised the first online forum on July 28 for healthcare professionals from the public and private medical institutions. The forum covered topics on epidemiology and latest epidemic situation in Foshan, diagnosis and clinical management of CF, as well as anti-mosquito measures. The forum enhanced healthcare professionals' knowledge on the disease and its responsive measures through sharing and explanation by experts. The CHP will organise a second forum for healthcare professionals tomorrow.

The CHP also issued letters to all doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong to provide them with the latest epidemiological information and appeal them to watch out for CF-related symptoms among those who return to Hong Kong from outbound travel. If CF cases are detected, they should be immediately referred to hospitals for treatment and reported to the DH in accordance with the established mechanism so that the DH can initiate epidemiological investigations, and implement prevention and control measures.

Latest situation regarding CF

According to the information from the Foshan health authority, as of July 28, there were over 5 600 cases in Foshan. The majority of cases (4 890 cases) were in Shunde District. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases so far. Moreover, confirmed cases were also recorded in other cities in Guangdong Province recently. Regarding Macao, as of July 29, there were six imported cases of CF, four of them travelled toFoshan during the incubation period.

In 2019, Hong Kong recorded 11 imported cases of CF. There have been no CF cases since 2020."

​林文健醫生指出： 「感謝國家衞生健康委員會及廣東省衞生健康委員會的支持，是次基孔肯雅熱的聯防聯控工作，充分體現粵港澳三地在傳染病防控及緊急應變等方面的持續深化合作。衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）根據三地建立的傳染病通報機制，充分掌握廣東省近日基孔肯雅熱的最新情況。為促進傳染病專業人員的合作，加強交流疫情防控經驗，衞生署早前已派遣兩名現場流行病學醫生前往佛山市疾病預防控制中心，實地參與當地流行病學調查及疫情防控工作，包括蚊媒監測、社區滅蚊行動，以及患者管理等，以汲取在防治基孔肯雅熱方面的寶貴經驗。」

業界講座

中心感染控制處聯同醫院管理局傳染病控制及培訓中心於七月二十八日舉辦了首場網上講座，供公營及私營醫療機構的醫護人員參加。講座內容涵蓋流行病學及佛山市最新的疫情情況、基孔肯雅熱的診斷、臨床治理，以及防蚊滅蚊措施。透過專家的分享及講解，加強醫護人員對該疾病的認識及應對措施。中心的第二場講座將於明日舉行，供醫護人員參加。

中心亦已去信全港醫生和醫院，以提供最新流行病學資訊，並呼籲他們留意外遊回港的求診人士是否有基孔肯雅熱相關病徵。如發現病例，應即時轉介病人入院治理，並按既定機制向衞生署呈報，以展開流行病學調查及防控工作。

基孔肯雅熱的最新情況

根據佛山衞生當局資訊，截至七月二十八日佛山市已錄得超過5 600宗個案，絕大部分個案在順德區錄得（4 890宗）。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。此外，廣東省其他城市近日亦出現確診個案。澳門方面，截至七月二十九日，錄得六宗基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，其中四名患者於潛伏期內曾到佛山市。

本港在二○一九年，錄得11宗基孔肯雅熱的輸入個案。由二○二○年至今，沒有錄得確診基孔肯雅熱的個案。"

大家好！今天很高興跟大家一起見證香港四川社團總會第二屆理事會執委會就職，同時為「錦繡天府安逸四川」四川非遺文化走進香港演出拉開序幕。

四川素有「天府之國」的美譽，自然資源豐富、文化底蘊深厚。不論是碧水藍天的九寨溝、雲海佛光的峨眉山，還是憨態可掬的國寶熊貓、神秘璀璨的三星堆文明，甚至是傳承千年的川劇藝術和驚艷世界的變臉絕技，這些自然遺產和文化瑰寶塑造了四川獨特的人文景觀，成為國家與世界交流的重要窗口。

四川近年在科技創新、綠色發展等領域都有長足發展，經濟活力持續提升，是國家西部地區經濟的重要引擎，也是西部大開發戰略中的核心省份。二○一八年，香港特區政府與四川省政府建立了川港合作會議機制，為兩地提供了重要的協作平台，有效深化川港合作。香港作為國際金融、貿易和航運中心，擁有強大的經貿網絡和專業的金融服務能力，能夠協助四川招商引資，並支持當地企業開拓海外市場，實現優勢互補，共同推進國家的高質量發展。

初唐文學天才王勃在送友人赴四川上任的名詩句說：「海內存知己，天涯若比鄰。」雖然四川跟香港相隔千里，但兩地人民緊密相連。為了深化川港兩地的連繫，香港四川社團總會自二○一九年成立以來，一直扮演着川港交流與合作的重要橋樑角色。總會不但致力團結在港川籍鄉賢的力量，推動川港兩地互利共贏，更積極加強兩地在經貿、文化、教育等領域的務實合作，促進民心相通。去年，總會聯同特區政府和多個地區團體，舉辦了「喜迎熊貓系列活動」，與香港市民共同慶祝香港大熊貓家庭喜添四位新成員，並藉此掀起「熊貓熱潮」，為香港旅遊發展注入新活力。對於總會的孜孜付出和卓越貢獻，我表示感謝和敬佩。

習近平主席強調，建設文化強國對中國式現代化建設和中華民族復興大業十分重要，並指出我們必須更加主動地傳播中華文化，展示中國形象，提升國家文化的軟實力。今年，總會在四川省政府的大力支持下，開展「錦繡天府安逸四川」四川非遺文化到香港展現。活動邀請多位優秀的四川藝術家來港，為我們帶來變臉、清音等極具傳統特色的表演，同時也把蜀錦、銀花絲、糖畫等非遺工藝帶到香港展出。除了今晚的演出外，總會還會於未來兩天在深水埗和啟德舉行四川非遺文化活動，讓市民近距離感受四川的文化魅力，進一步鞏固兩地人民的情誼。展望未來，我相信總會將繼續發揮同鄉社團的橋樑作用，向海外僑胞和外國友人展現川港兩地的優秀文化藝術創作，說好川港故事、說好中國故事。

最後，我祝願國家繁榮昌盛，川港兩地人和業茂，香港四川社團總會新一屆理事會執委會工作順利，「錦繡天府安逸四川」四川非遺文化走進香港演出圓滿成功！謝謝大家。"

報告詳列了不同的數據，闡述香港因着制度優勢與不斷提升的競爭力，進一步吸引了資金流入、企業和人才匯聚，成果顯著；在多項外商調查以至多項國際排名方面均廣受認同。這些事實全方位說明了香港開放、安全、穩定、可靠、高效和國際化的營商環境。

事實上，多組數字都反映了國際投資者對香港的信心正進一步提升，例如：

股市表現穩步向上：恒生指數繼去年上升18%後，今年以來再上升了27%，上半年每日成交額上升120%至2,400億元。今年截至七月中，港股有52隻IPO，即新股集資，集資額接近1,300億元，按年上升約6倍。
吸引海內外企業：去年，母公司在境外的香港公司接近10 000家，按年上升10%。引進重點企業辦公室自二○二二年年底以來，引進了84家重點企業，它們合共會投資約500億元，創造20 000個職位，而它們所使用的樓面面積都達到168萬平方呎；此外，在二○二三年一月至二○二五年上半年，投資推廣署亦協助了超過1 300家海內外企業在港開設或拓展業務，帶來約1,600億元投資。
吸引人才：各項引進人才計劃共收到約50萬份申請，已批出33萬個申請，約22萬人已經抵達香港。
國際排名：在瑞士洛桑國際管理發展學院的《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港連續兩年上升合共四位，登上全球第三；另外，今年初的國際金融中心排名，香港繼續位列三甲；而去年十月，加拿大菲沙研究所《世界經濟自由度2024年度報告》，香港亦都再次名列第一。而三大評級機構，最近均一致給予香港良好的信用評級和「穩定」的評級展望等。


在這幾年，國安法的實施讓香港重建安全穩定的環境，不僅保障了市民大眾的權利和自由，同時也讓香港成為更吸引國際資金和投資的安全港。

短期而言，香港的經濟在去年增長2.5%，今年首季增長3.1%。明日我們會公布第二季的本地生產總值預估數字，估計增長勢頭保持，這將是連續第十個季度增長。出口、整體投資、私人消費預計均會錄得正增長。政府通過積極推動旅遊業及盛事項目帶動消費氣氛，消費市道呈初步回穩的跡象；住宅物業市場亦趨向穩定。政府會繼續透過多項措施支援面對挑戰的行業，例如資金周轉、市場開拓、數字化轉型等，以提升其競爭力和生產力等。

總的而言，面對複雜多變的外圍環境，香港經濟結構正在升級轉型，我們看到的機遇大於挑戰。金融市場表現亮麗、創科產業快速發展，傳統行業也積極轉型升級，一些面對挑戰的行業，例如零售、餐飲等，也有穩住的勢頭。宏觀而言，有國家的支持，政府、各界和市民的共同努力，只要我們準確識變、科學應變、主動求變，必定可以取得新的突破，發展新的增長點，為香港開創新局面。

我的開場發言到此，看看大家有沒有甚麽提問。

記者：三位你們好。想先問你們三位如何評估香港下半年，甚至全年的經濟增長的前景？接下來有一些譬如是關稅措施，對於香港的營商環境會否帶來一些變數？第二，見到有不少外資來到，國際排名都有些上升，但直接貼近民生的，例如餐飲、零售，以至戲院行業，又如何受惠？謝謝。

財政司司長：多謝你。我們估計香港下半年會維持經濟增長。今年第一季本地生產總值增長3.1%，第二季的數字明天公布，大致上會維持這個勢頭。現時在地緣政治和關稅戰下，外圍環境是複雜多變，亦有很多不確定性，具體增長要同時看推動增長的「三頭馬車」：出口、消費和投資。關稅戰對出口的影響還要視乎具體措施如何。過去這段時間，內地從事出口的企業其實已經在海外，尤其是東南亞，重新布局其產業鏈和供應鏈，以緩減關稅對它們的影響。至於消費方面，我們看到的數字顯示消費是穩定下來，待會我請政府經濟顧問仔細跟大家說明。在旅客訪港方面，增長勢頭是非常好，加上特區政府一直舉辦不同盛事活動吸引旅客，我們見到上半年旅客增長數字是雙位數，尤其是國際旅客的增長更為顯著，這對於我們的市道都會有一定幫助。

目前來說，香港經濟正經歷轉型階段，在轉型階段裏，不同行業以至企業，其反應和調整進程都未必完全一樣，步伐亦未必一致。我們見到一些行業是比較好，譬如一些新興行業如創科和Web 3.0，即金融科技、數字資產這一塊；但同時亦有一些行業，尤其是傳統行業，在轉型過程中遇到一些挑戰和壓力。我們會盡力支持他們轉型：資金方面有不同的貸款擔保計劃；如果他們是出口企業則在市場推廣方面，至於本地零售和餐飲企業，我們通過不同的計劃助力它們的數碼轉型和升級，這都是希望幫助它們更快更好地適應這個轉變中的環境。

署理政府經濟顧問：我或許補充一些數據給大家。其實早前已經公布的零售業總銷貨價值（二○二五年五月份零售業銷貨額臨時統計數字）在連續下跌14個月後，今年五月已經轉跌為升，（數字）為2.4%。相關六月的數字（二○二五年六月零售業銷貨額統計）很快會作出公布，相信也會穩住勢頭。

至於食肆方面，第一季（二零二五年第一季食肆收益及購貨額臨時統計數字）的情況輕微下跌0.6%，但是初步數字顯示第二季也見到回穩，這是零售和餐飲的情況。

剛才司長也提到訪港旅客的數目，上半年錄得雙位數增長，直至七月，我們留意到首28日的數字按年上升12%，所以相關勢頭仍然維持。在這個背景下，明日會公布GDP（本地生產總值）數字（二○二五年第二季本地生產總值預先估計數字），所以在這些穩定的情況之下，以及看到現在的消費氣氛有些回穩，私人消費開支在第二季有望止跌回升。以上是我的補充，謝謝。

記者：都想延續講講零售業的話題，因為看到近年有些零售或者食肆都說他們受「內捲」這個問題所影響。其實你們在這方面怎樣可以幫助到他們零售業在現時這個經營狀況比較困難的情況之下，幫他們成功轉型？另一方面，就是講到政府很大力地推進盛事經濟，今年都見到早前的足球賽事的反應都非常好，其實你們未來明年在盛事經濟方面的計劃會是怎樣？會聚焦哪一個方面去做？以及有些坊間的意見建議你們向中央爭取明年APEC財長會議在香港舉行，政府的態度是如何？另一方面，談到剛剛銀行公布的業績都說到房地產對他們的壞帳影響其實都開始浮現出來。政府現時如何看房地產市道，除了房地產市道的走勢和對其他各個香港經濟不同環節，例如是銀行業的穩定方面，其實你們的看法是如何？多謝。

財政司司長：多謝你。零售和餐飲方面在這段時間事實上遇到壓力。在經濟轉型過程中，商戶要不斷就着市場變化、客戶喜好、對購物、餐飲等消費體驗和需求的轉變，要想不同辦法推陳出新。

我們見到市面上有個別商戶在轉型過程中做得不錯，當然，亦有一些面臨的壓力比較大。我們希望繼續多方面支持努力打拼的企業，尤其不少是中小型企業，包括剛才所說在資金周轉、以資訊科技提升其競爭力、提升效率等，以至搞旺市面的氣氛，最重要是人丁旺，氣氛好，大家就會有興趣出來消費。

這就帶到你剛才提到的盛事。今年我們安排了不少盛事活動。早前大家在啟德體育園都看過不同比賽，亦有演唱會和其他活動。未來，我們會用好這個重要的基建設施，主辦更多活動。

明年的盛事，稍後會再作公布。盛事並不單是旅遊，亦包括體育，以至其他活動。而就旅遊而言，旅客除了來購物以外，也可在港深度遊，以至主題旅遊，這些都是我們正在全力開拓的方向。

同時，我們亦鼓勵跨界別的合作，例如最近在啟德體育園的比賽，附近的酒店和食肆會合作推出項目。這類跨界別合作，令旅客有更好的體驗，覺得更物有所值。

剛才你提到一些活動的主辦，請恕我在此不就個別項目回應。總的來說，在特區政府來說，未來不同類型的盛事，不管是金融、體育、文化等，我們都會繼續大力去推動。同時，我們亦鼓勵私人機構舉辦盛事，例如旅遊事務署和旅遊發展局很樂意幫助他們舉辦不同項目，讓在活動舉辦期間來到的客人覺得更好玩、更開心，可以在香港逗留得更久，多住一兩晚。

我們鼓勵在香港的私人機構，例如金融機構以至其他機構舉辦活動。最近的動漫節，參與程度相當踴躍，參加的人士除了來自內地之外，也有不少來自東南亞，甚至遠道從歐美而來。我們希望通過不同類型的活動，「百貨應百客」，能夠多方面吸引不同人士來到香港。

我們曾與主辦單位和來到香港參加活動的朋友談起，很多人都很享受在香港的旅程，覺得這個城市除了很安全、出入很方便以外，亦是多姿多彩。

你最後關於銀行業績的問題。就本港的房地產市道而言，住宅樓宇的樓價是趨向平穩的，特別是看看最近這三個月，可以說是有輕微、約百分之零點幾的上升，總的來說平穩。

商業和辦公樓方面，可能還需要一些時間去恢復。畢竟過去一段時間，有一定的供應；另一方面，疫情之後的辦公方式，亦轉變了很多。而營商方式方面，例如銷售途徑等亦起了不少變化，例如電商的流行。

在政府而言，我們正處理這個問題，例如我們已經沒有賣商業用地，不在這個時間增加供應，給時間市場消化目前市面上的樓面面積。同時間，亦由需求方面着手。這有幾方面，一是鼓勵非政府機構，如果要用地方，同時有財力的話，可以購置辦公地方，港交所便是其中一個例子。

除此之外，在現時經濟轉型中，個別有些行業的景況不錯，大家可以見到在中環有一些大型跨國金融機構一下子便租很多層的樓面面積，尤其做財富和資產管理的金融機構。我們亦見到一些對沖基金大規模擴充辦公的地方。

此外，我們也見到有一間從事第三代互聯網的企業整幢購入兩幢大廈，一幢在銅鑼灣，另一幢在灣仔，來做第三代互聯網、金融科技方面的業務。所以，當我們努力發展經濟、招商引資，越來越多企業進駐香港的話，他們就需要用地方，這樣就可消化辦公樓面。

我剛才說，引進重點企業辦公室引進了大概80多間重點企業，總投資約500億元。我們統計過，這些企業用到約168萬平方呎的樓面；投資推廣署方面，引進公司的數量就更大。

另一方面，我們亦盡量配合市場上把寫字樓、按它們的位置和市場需要轉型做其他用途，例如一間大學在紅磡購買了整座樓來做學生宿舍等。這即是說，靈活一點以不同用途來把存貨盤活。

總括而言，我們是從供應到需求雙管齊下，處理目前的辦公樓存貨。

至於銀行業績方面，整體而言本港銀行在這兩年其實利潤相當不錯。當然，每間銀行的個別情況有點不相同，我亦不會評論個別銀行，因為不同銀行發展業務時有不同重點。但有一點都可以說的，就是整體我們銀行的壞帳撥備，其實在全球的標準來說，都是處於一個非常穩健的水平。個別有些銀行的經營利潤比較好，尤其在過往一段時間，有些銀行做資產管理、財富管理，以至因應資本市場好、股票市場暢旺，從資本市場方面賺得豐厚利潤，這樣的話就讓他們有更好的條件就着一些呆壞帳--有時也未必實際是壞帳，而是銀行想審慎一點，加大撥備，這方面也不出奇。

總的來說，即使是作出撥備之後，整體來說，銀行的資本充足率達到約21%，其實環球的標準要求都只是8%，而且它們的流動性很充裕。

從這個角度來看，我們認為金融體系、銀行體系仍然是非常穩健。我們在多年前，在二○二／二一年，差不多是COVID前，已經就商業銀行信貸在宏觀審慎方面下工夫。

記者：你好，想問對上一次是二○二一年發布這份報告，有否說為甚麼今次會選擇這個時間推出？數字說得那麼好，但其實市民好像看不到。今次發布這份報告是否想穩定民心？另外之前網誌說過現時香港在經濟轉型的階段，會幫忙轉型，有沒有一些具體措施？謝謝。

財政司司長：經濟方面，如果我們看數字，正如剛才政府經濟顧問所說，我們去年錄得經濟增長，今年第一季亦繼續增長，第二季亦會維持增長幅度，整年來說，二○二五年都維持經濟增長。但經濟正在轉型中，一是因應地緣政治，二是面對科技變革，三是數字化轉型加快，這些都使得競爭十分激烈。所以香港經濟正轉型，這是結構性轉型──包括產業結構的改變。除了國際金融中心、貿易中心外，推動我們下一步經濟增長的重要動力是創新科技，但創新科技不只是香港獨有。環顧全球，國家之間、經濟體之間的競爭，都圍繞創科的發展和應用，而這方面是需要時間來培育的。過去這段時間，我們積極培育創科產業，無論在投資和就業方面，相關增長都相當快，剛才我已用引進重點企業辦公室的數字向大家說明。但同時，一些傳統行業，譬如大家剛才所說的零售和餐飲業，事實上是有壓力的，這個我們很理解。在政府來說，我們也想方設法提供一些支援。當然最大的幫助是人流更旺、生意更好，所以我們很努力舉辦更多盛事，又爭取內地來港旅客的購物免稅額度增加，這方面我們會繼續努力看看是否可以有進一步增加的可能。而旅客來到，我們的旅遊體育文化設施等各方面是否可以更加吸引？是否可有更多不同活動，讓旅客留更長時間？有更多人逗留，在這裏的消費便更多。這是大家正在努力的方向。

至於一些受壓比較大的行業，除了剛才說的餐飲和零售，還有建造業。就建造業而言，我們認為會趨向穩定。為何這樣說？住宅物業市場現時已穩定下來，當住宅物業市場穩定下來，當目前的一些樓盤──譬如最近期一些一手樓盤，開售的市價相當「貼市」且賣得不錯──當這些動起來時，接下來二手樓樓市便會動起來。目前息口減下來的速度和幅度比大家原本想像來得慢，因為美國面對通脹等問題。但最近兩、三個月，因為外來的資金很多，使香港的資金更充裕，所以銀行同業拆息低了很多，這除了減輕了企業經營的壓力，也對住宅市場提供了一定支持。

隨着我們的經濟持續發展，市場對住宅物業自然有更大需求。企業來到這裏擴充業務，亦會衍生更大的需求。至於我剛才提到吸引人才，通過不同的輸入人才計劃，我們批了近33萬宗申請，來了約22萬人，其他人會陸續來。陸續來的也不會是自己一個人來，很多是帶同家庭來的，這些人才相對來說比較年輕，收入亦相對較高。這些都是消費力，也是我們物業市場下一階段的購買力。去年樓價下跌，但租金上升，即樓價和租金背馳，這個現象説明甚麼呢？可以這樣看，一方面，當樓價下跌，大家想買樓時會怕它未止跌，暫時不入市，所以會暫時租住。從外面移居來港的人初到來，大多是先租住，先看一下自己是否適應，另一方面是看看孩子在哪裏讀書，才決定住在哪裏。我們估計這些都會是日後的購買力。此外，一些內地來的朋友如果要買樓，會需要資金，內地的資金是否能夠調動出來，目前來說可調出來的資金相對還有一些限制，我們正努力跟相關的中央部委研究是否可以在一個合適的範圍內，就這方面有所放寬，讓內地朋友更便利地將資金調過來，又不會因此造成資本外流。如果可以這樣做的話，他們也會成為購買力的一部分。

對各位市民來說，在現時的轉型過程中，事實上有不少人的壓力很大、這點我們明白。我們都很努力，希望通過一步步的工作，當成果顯現出來的時候，大家都會受惠。現時整體失業率大約是3.5%，但收入中位數持續上升。換句話說，現時最大的挑戰就是在轉型過程裏，個別行業和部分市民未能完全受惠，因此我們會提供更多支援。這包括職業再培訓計劃，而就青年人而言，我們也有不同計劃，包括幫助他們創業、提供實習機會，希望從多方面協助大家更容易適應這個過程，也提升自己。謝謝。

"Remarks at press conference on ""Report on Hong Kong's Business Environment: Unique Strengths under 'One Country, Two Systems'"" (with photos/video)",2025-07-30 20:40,2025-07-30 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000768.htm,"  The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan; the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau; and the Acting Government Economist, Dr Cecilia Lam, held a press conference on the ""Report on Hong Kong's Business Environment: Unique Strengths under 'One Country, Two Systems'"" this afternoon (July 30). Following are their remarks:

Reporter: I have some questions. First of all, this report seems that it is a wrapping up of all the measures over the past few years. So, what is the significance of this report to Hong Kong's future development? Also, amid the rising challenges such as the tariff increases, how are you going to convince foreign chambers or investors to invest in Hong Kong? The last question is about the reports of the developer of 11 Skies of the Airport City project, with some reports saying that the developer has intended to sell this mega project, because of lack of tenants and also lacklustre prospects. So what is your take on the proposal of selling 11 Skies to other parties? Thank you.

Financial Secretary: Thank you. First, the significance of this report. Over the past few years, because of COVID, a lot of overseas visitors didn't have the opportunity to visit Hong Kong. Given the geopolitical landscape, there has been some misperception about the situation of Hong Kong in the western world. . We are trying very hard to reach out to the international community, to explain to them what is really happening here in Hong Kong by sharing facts and data. The purpose of this report is to recap our developments in a concise report for distribution to them, and this report will be made available online, accessible to anyone who is interested.

 On the question of tariffs, on the question of the China-US geopolitical tension, of course, there are challenges, for example, in terms of exports, but there are also opportunities in respect of the international financial centre status of Hong Kong. For challenges on export, the direct impact is minimal because Hong Kong is basically a service economy; we don't have much manufacturing. On the other hand, the indirect impact could be significant, because we re-export for the Mainland. But over the years, we have seen a number of trends. One of them is Mainland companies realigning their industry bases and supply chains across Southeast Asia. For exports to certain markets, such as the US, a lot of the exports come from those regions. When you look at the figures - the export figures from the Mainland to the US, or from the Mainland via Hong Kong to the US - the share of US in Mainland's total export has been declining.

 From our standpoint, we are adjusting our position. In addition to doing re-export, we have shifted to provide high-value supply chain management and the related trade finance and professional services. That is our response. For opportunities, I think we should not underestimate them. Given the geopolitical landscape, it is increasingly difficult for Mainland companies to go to the US for listing. These companies, would naturally want to come to Hong Kong for listing, because by coming to Hong Kong, they can access both international and Mainland capital. This is a very interesting value proposition to them, and has been demonstrated by the figures so far this year. In fact, we have over 200 companies in the pipeline waiting for listing. But the opportunities are more than the IPO market. Say in asset and wealth management, residents in the GBA (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area) are interested in having certain assets allocated offshore. Naturally, Hong Kong is the destination. The recent improvement in February last year to the GBA Wealth Management Connect - with the implementation of those measures, we have seen significant inflow of capital from the GBA into Hong Kong. In addition, we also have observed capital flow from the Middle East and ASEAN in the asset and wealth management sector. We are quite confident that, by the year 2027 and 2028 the latest - we will overtake Switzerland in cross-border wealth management.

 Another dimension is Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" under the current geopolitical situation. We have observed Mainland companies' keen interest to go global. First, this is national policy, i.e. high-level two-way opening up. Second, there is also a need, because these companies want to utilise the production capacity they have and do more exports. What we have been pitching to them is that the best way to do it is to come to Hong Kong, set up a company, use Hong Kong as a platform as well as a brand to go overseas. In our experience in engaging the Middle East and ASEAN, the value of the ""Hong Kong brand"" is very much respected. This is one way in which we can help them. In the process, Our professional services and other service providers will benefit.

 Finally, on 11 Skies, I won't comment on individual projects. But overall, the attitude of the Government is that, given the economic transition, and given the challenges currently in the non-domestic property market, banks should be supportive to their clients and help them ride through challenges. In the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, HKMA, a working group has been set up between the Hong Kong Association of Banks and the HKMA. This working group deals with individual cases with a view to helping the communication between the banks and borrowers, so that the lenders can extend a more accommodative and facilitative approach to help borrowers who have a viable business model and have a genuine interest in carrying on their business, but are just facing a liquidity crunch. That is the overall attitude of the Government. Thank you.

Reporter: Hi Mr Chan. So, I just want to follow up on the previous question first. So what's the significance of issuing the report now, like after the previous issuance of four years ago? Like, why does the Government choose to issue the new report at present? And also, you mentioned a lot of positive signs in the markets, like the stock markets booming, and Hong Kong also saw a record capital inflows in the first half of the year. So why does the Government still remain quite conservative over an uptick of the annual GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth target for the whole year? And also, how do you see the sustainability of such momentum moving forward? And second question I also want to ask about four sectors that are facing structural changes, like you mentioned, to the retail and catering. Do you see the need to further enhance the support measures besides helping them achieve digital transformation? And finally, about the tariff truce, so the Chinese and US (United States) officials just reached agreements to extend their tariff suspension. So how do you assess the impacts on local business, and would the Government take any steps to help, perhaps exports or local businesses to take this opportunity? Thank you.

Financial Secretary: Thank you. Well, the last report was published in 2021. Over the past few years, because of COVID, a lot of overseas travellers hadn't come to Hong Kong. Given the geopolitical landscape, the perception about Hong Kong in the Western world is not entirely factual and correct. There are some misconceptions. So the purpose of this report is to show to them the current situation in Hong Kong, so that they will be able to better understand what is happening in this city. If they are interested, they are welcome to visit us to see for themselves what it is really like here and the tremendous opportunities available.

 As regards the question about the GDP estimate for the whole year, the GDP growth for the first half of this year has been positive. For the first quarter, the growth was 3.1 per cent; for the second quarter, we have maintained the momentum. But given the geopolitical landscape, there are enormous uncertainty and volatility. At this stage, we think it would be prudent to keep the current GDP estimate. There is in fact a mechanism, a defined timetable for reviewing the GDP estimate regularly. On a published timeline, the Government Economist will share with the community the economic situation, and determine at that time whether to make any revision. It's better to follow that established practice as it provides certainty to the market.

 As to supporting the retail and catering sector, we will keep an open mind. I have elaborated on the situation and how we have been trying to help, but we will continue to closely monitor the situation and if necessary, roll out measures. At this stage, we think the current support measures should stay. Let us observe for a longer time. We have been providing various support measures such as the BUD Fund (Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales) for marketing development and e-commerce. Algernon would share more about that.

Before passing to Algernon, I would say the recent discussions leading to the temporary suspension of tariff rise is, of course, a positive sign. But on the other hand, we are conscious of the fact that things can change overnight. There is still tremendous uncertainty, and consequently, volatility. So for our work, first, we need to ensure financial stability and financial security. On the other hand, stay on course, focus on what we have set out to do, and be persistent with our efforts. That includes reinforcing our relationship with traditional markets like Europe and the US, and at the same time, opening up new markets and new capital sources from the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Thank you, Algernon please.

Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development: Regarding the challenges facing the retail and food and beverage sectors, we have different measures and funding helping the retail sector, such as the BUD Fund. We are also encouraging the sectors to look for changes and transformation, and e-commerce is one of the measures that we promote. Just today, we are going to launch the Hong Kong Shopping Festival for cross-border e-commerce to allow the retail sector to do more e-commerce business. For the maximum cumulative funding of $7 million per enterprise under the BUD Fund, they can apply for $1 million for e-commerce business to arrange for promotion and advertising for e-commerce business across the border.

There are also measures to encourage tourists to come to Hong Kong. Actually, the number of tourists coming to Hong Kong is increasing. It is a positive sign that would help the retail sector. But most importantly, as mentioned by the Financial Secretary, it is time for transformation. We have to look at customer behaviour and their needs, and how we can satisfy customer demand. It is one of the major issues that we have to jointly resolve with enterprises. I have met with different chambers and associations of the retail sector. We had very good discussions on helping them to tackle the challenging situation. As mentioned by the Financial Secretary, we will keep an open mind to look at the situation and to see whether there is a need to introduce further measures to help the retail and food and beverage sectors. Thank you.

Financial Secretary: We should be very confident in Hong Kong's attractiveness as a hub for foreign businesses and talent. Over the past few years, I've been travelling a lot and also heavily engaged with the foreign business community in Hong Kong. I can summarise three key reasons why people should choose Hong Kong. First is, of course, for business reasons. Hong Kong has the proximity and sometimes priority access to the Mainland market. Depending on which sector you are in – if you are in the tech sector, say in the biotech sector, Hong Kong has an additional advantage because of our proximity to Shenzhen, and we are part of the GBA (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area) which is a technology hub. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster is very competitive in innovation.

 Apart from that, it is the capital market and the full range of funding options available here. For companies at different development stages, whether they are start-ups or others, we welcome them. In Hong Kong, we have around 4,700 start-ups, and the number represents a significant increase compared to that a few years ago. About 20 per cent of their founders come from overseas, and they come here for funding, professional advice, mentoring, and opportunities. In my discussions with the start-ups in Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport, they value these as well as the innovation ecosystem very much. For start-ups, what they need are application scenarios, professional advice and funding support, and they are all available here. In Hong Kong, we have set up the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, which provides patient capital. This means that if enterprises are engaged in cutting-edge technologies, we are willing to support them from small, and help them grow and connect them with fund managers to raise funds.

The second reason is for their families and children. It is well recognised Hong Kong's law and order is excellent. We are a very safe city. Education here is also outstanding. Moreover, this is an open and multicultural society, and it is very free. We have gathered a lot of overseas professionals and foreign businessmen here.

Finally, it is about our lifestyle. Whether it is city life, F&B (food and beverage) or our countryside. So with all these, I think if we play our cards right, Hong Kong's opportunities in the future are tremendous. Thank you for attending this conference. I appreciate your time. Thank you.

​立法會：運輸及物流局局長根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》及《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》動議的兩項擬議決議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 19:15,2025-07-30 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000711.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》及《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》動議的兩項擬議決議案的總結發言：

主席：

感謝各位議員剛才表達的寶貴意見，我一一細心聆聽，現在此作一個綜合的回應。

首先，今日就這兩項動議，我們的目的很簡單、很直接，就是提升道路安全和維持路面的交通暢順。在香港，道路的空間實在是有限，有私家車亦有商用車，之後我會再談及商用車。剛才有多位議員都提到自己或其他從社會上聽到的意見，作為駕駛者，當去到某些地區想泊車然後消費、吃東西，或有一些夜間的經濟活動，正因為某些地區在某些時段會有特別多的私家車使用者到訪。即使那個區域有兩條或三條行車線，亦可能會因為車位有限，有私家車或會停泊而佔用了兩條行車線，導致只得一條行車線供其他人使用，造成交通擠塞，這些情況現時在社會不時出現。

今日我聽到多位議員都對特區政府提出這個就一些定額罰款作出水平調整的動議，大部分都表示認同和理解，尤其是對於調整19項有關道路安全和導致交通擠塞相關的一些罰款額，多位議員剛才的發言都表示認同，亦都認為有需要增加阻嚇力。其中有個別議員提及希望做到有效的交通管理，以及減少路面擠塞，提升行人的過路安全。局方和署方（運輸署）未來會大力積極推動利用科技在道路和行人路過路設施上，包括交通燈實時管控，亦會有一些比較創新的設計，這是我們未來的方向。

不少議員發言關注泊車位供應。正如我在開場發言提及，接下來我想聚焦講述未來的策略，以積極回應多位議員剛才提及包括商用車方面的關注。政府過去幾年積極推展一系列短期及中長期措施，採取多管齊下的策略，全方位、默默耕耘增加泊車位，當中包括政策創新、多利用科技、推動不同部門加強合作，努力盡快優先滿足商用車輛的泊車需求。跟大家分享一下整體的數字，透過不同措施提供的泊車位總數達30 000個，商用車位佔了三分之一，而過去三年新增的泊車位則超過15 000個。泊車位與領牌車輛數目的比例，以私家車為例，由二○二一年的1.09逐漸回升至現時的1.14，增長達4.6%，可見增加泊車位措施已漸見成效。

展望未來，政府預計未來兩年內新增泊車位數量將超過12 000個，包括至少700個商用車泊位。另外我們會努力在新短期租約停車場及私人項目提供更多泊位，並聚焦於增加商用車泊位，特別是剛才盧偉國議員和陳紹雄議員均提到的分區情況──較為短缺及違例泊車比較常見的地區如觀塘、葵青、黃大仙、油尖旺及深水埗。就分區做一些指標未必切實可行，我們認為必須要由源頭做起，尤其是一些商用車泊位。很多司機在一日營運之後，可能會回到所居住的地方，譬如一些公共屋邨，所以我們的策略要更加聚焦他們的居住地或者在鄰近地方尋求一些泊車位。惟土地空間真的有限，我們希望盡量靈活使用一些土地。我今日向大家強調，具體和具針對性的措施總共有八項：（i）未來在規劃新發展區時，在道路設計上配置夜間路旁商用車泊車位，供商用車夜間停泊；（ii）積極安排於現有公營房屋開放更多上落客貨處，供商用車夜間停泊，以配合普遍居於公營房屋的商用車司機需要；（iii）安排非住宅用地的附屬泊車位和上落客貨處予商用車於夜間停泊；（iv）現時全港已設有約1 800個夜間路旁泊車位，未來運輸署會加大力度，搜尋更多合適的夜間路旁泊車位，尤其是公共屋邨鄰近位置；（v）鑑於過去幾年商用車位流失主因是許多短期租約停車場被收回，未來我們在決定這些土地的用途時，會加重照顧商用車泊位需求的考量，例如我們近期再與各政府部門加強商討，爭取短期內可在短期租約停車場再增加200個商用車車位，運輸署會繼續爭取設置更多的短期租約停車場；（vi）按二○二一年修訂的《香港規劃標準與準則》的首批資助房屋將於明年陸續落成，我們預計在按照此《準則》而落成及設計的資助房屋中，提供4 800個停車位，當中包括超過200個商用車位；（vii）進一步鼓勵私人停車場採用自動泊車系統。我們計劃在二○二六年或之前，提供不少於3 000個自動化泊車位，現時有五個自動化公眾停車場的工務工程項目正處於興建階段，包括位於將軍澳、新蒲崗及深水埗，而這些系統將會提供多種不同類型的自動泊車系統，包括拼圖型、立體型和圓筒型；再加上六個分布在荃灣、大埔、深水埗、馬鞍山、油麻地的短期租約停車場；我們會爭取在今年年底至二○二九年期間落成有關項目；（viii）正如剛才多位議員提到，除了硬件，在軟件方面，我們會透過加強應用科技和數據以增加泊車位的資訊發放，大幅利用科技提升駕駛者的泊車效率和體驗，引入自動泊車系統以善用空間增加車位密度，亦希望透過應用程式提供實時空置泊車位資訊，以便利駕駛者尋找泊車位，現時已覆蓋超過700個停車場的12萬個泊位和分布全港十八區的全部兩萬多個路旁咪錶位，並透過修例容許駕駛者使用遙控泊車功能，方便他們在狹窄車位泊車。透過上述的八項措施，我很有信心並承諾會令未來香港的泊車位供應持續大為改善，至於商用車位方面，我們定下一個務實目標──未來新增商用車泊位的速率會比過往更加快。

執法方面，警務處進行交通執法時，主要考慮是確保道路安全，減少意外及傷亡，以及維持道路暢通。警務處早前已向立法會交通事務委員會報告前線人員會在不影響道路安全的前提下，視乎現場實際環境靈活判斷，或會就個別情況作酌情處理。根據警方提供的資料，警務人員除了會按照既定的執法指引，亦會視乎每宗個案的相關情況作出考慮，包括評估涉事的車輛是否會造成交通阻塞或構成危險；違例的情況會否屬於一些重點交通執法項目之中，特別是和交通擠塞相關的情況；駕駛者有沒有具備一個合理的原因，以及他們會在合乎指引的情況下適當行使酌情權，例如發出警告以代替用檢控方式處理、違例泊車如果並未造成很嚴重的阻塞，而司機亦都願意立即駛走，在這些情況下警方都有一個詳盡的指引執法。

主席，是次建議的罰款額的調整，相較過去三十多年的通脹率，加幅相對溫和。在考慮的時候，我們希望做到情理兼備，既有助加強阻嚇作用，亦保障交通安全和交通暢順，同時已充分考慮運輸業界的經營情況。收費調整永遠沒有一個好的時機，但是多年不調整的話，會令阻嚇力有所減低。我們希望透過這次修例，再配以我剛才所述的不同的措施，持續去加強道路的安全和提升交通管理上的效率。

主席，我懇請各位議員支持並通過這兩項決議案。多謝主席。"

立法會：商務及經濟發展局副局長就「積極拓展香港新經濟增長點」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 18:52,2025-07-30 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000710.htm,"以下是商務及經濟發展局副局長陳百里博士今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上，就「積極拓展香港新經濟增長點」議員議案的開場發言：

代主席：

我感謝容海恩議員提出這項動議，亦感謝田北辰議員、陳曼琪議員和李浩然議員提出的修正案。

中共中央總書記、國家主席習近平於二○二五年三月五日全國兩會期間發表重要講話，提出要「守牢實體經濟這個根基，堅持推動傳統產業改造升級和開辟戰略性新興產業」。特區政府一直積極配合國家的戰略方向，把握香港在「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的優勢，在鞏固傳統優勢產業的同時，積極開拓新經濟增長點，提升香港的競爭力及國際影響力，充分扮演「超級聯繫人」與「超級增值人」的角色。今日討論的議案與政府的政策方向不謀而合，在此方向下具體工作該如何部署？

首先，我們要做好深化國際交往合作這方面的工作。香港會繼續發揮內聯外通的獨特優勢，連接內地及全球市場，同時進一步拓展「全球南方」新興市場。除了恆常的資助計劃和支援措施，政府一直努力招商引資，並為港商創造有利條件積極開拓新興市場。有關工作主要分為三方面：

第一，加強區域合作。政府正馬不停蹄地與東南亞國家聯盟、中東及「一帶一路」沿線地區展開經貿合作，包括香港於去年三月與巴林簽訂促進和保護投資協定（投資協定），而香港與卡塔爾已大致完成投資協定談判，並正與沙特阿拉伯、孟加拉國、埃及和秘魯探討簽訂投資協定。同時，我們會繼續積極聯繫《區域全面經濟伙伴關係協定》（RCEP）成員，透過不同平台及場合進行游說，爭取盡快加入RCEP，讓香港貢獻力量，促進區域經濟融合發展。

第二，建構高增值供應鏈。因應部分供應鏈正向「全球南方」及「一帶一路」沿線國家遷移，以及內地企業積極「走出去」的趨勢，投資推廣署和香港貿易發展局（貿發局）在去年十二月已建立高增值供應鏈服務機制，聯手吸引內地企業到香港建立管理離岸貿易和供應鏈的國際或區域總部，並為在港企業提供一站式專業諮詢服務，以協助它們「走出去」重新部署其環球供應鏈。該機制有助香港深化國際交往合作，同時有助開拓新經濟增長點。

第三，推進「一帶一路」建設。香港會繼續發揮作為「一帶一路」功能平台的角色。行政長官於今年五月率領50多位香港商貿代表和內地企業代表前往卡塔爾和科威特訪問，與中東地區進一步建立政府之間的關係、開拓合作領域擴大「朋友圈」。是次出訪成果相當理想，並達成了共59項合作備忘錄和協議合作，奠定多元基礎。

除了繼續努力深化與內地及國際市場的聯繫，政府亦會加強推動不同產業、不同領域的持續發展，包括創新科技、太空經濟、低空經濟、專業認證、清真產業、金融創新、綠色產業、文創產業及體育產業等方面。

在創新科技方面，政府以產業為導向，透過一系列措施推動香港創科發展及企業升級轉型，加快建設具有香港優勢的新實體經濟，並聚焦發展生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人，以及先進製造與新能源科技等具策略性意義的創科產業。

在太空經濟方面，國務院總理李強今年在《政府工作報告》提出了因地制宜發展新質生產力，開展新技術新產品新場景大規模應用示範行動，推進包括商業航天等的新產業。為配合國家發展新機遇，政府一直透過「創新及科技基金」支持各科技範疇的研究及發展，包括支援香港的大學和研發中心進行與航天相關的電子、數據處理和材料科學等範疇的研發。此外，政府已在InnoHK創新香港研發平台下成立香港太空機械人與能源中心。另外，為了讓業界更好把握低軌衞星作為全球衞星發展的新趨勢及當中的發展機遇，政府正進行簡化申請營辦低軌衞星牌照審批的研究工作，目標是在二○二五年內完成相關工作。

在低空經濟方面，財政司副司長領導的發展低空經濟工作組正以多管齊下的策略，全力構建智慧低空經濟生態圈。在應用層面上，我們透過推行「監管沙盒」試點項目，推動無人機技術在不同領域的突破性應用。法規方面，立法會剛於七月中通過有關擴大無人機規管範圍及開放載人飛行器試驗的法例修訂工作。工作組會繼續推進低空經濟基礎建設規劃及區域融合發展。

在清真產業方面，政府透過多方面提升香港在清真市場的競爭力。在吸引資金方面，政府已修訂法例，為發行伊斯蘭債券提供一個與傳統債券相若的稅務架構，並容許在政府債券計劃下發行伊斯蘭債券。至於貿易方面，貿發局一直就重點清真市場進行研究，為港商提供實用資訊。貿發局亦一直提供不同平台推動清真市場的商機，例如每年都在其美食商貿博覽推廣不同優質清真產品和食品，以及相關產品貿易，協助餐飲業拓展網絡和業務。另外，為推動旅遊業界提升穆斯林旅遊配套，香港旅遊發展局已積極與不同機構合作，透過提升穆斯林友善的旅遊設施；為酒店、景點和會議展覽場地進行相關評級；推動餐廳參與清真認證等，從而吸引更多穆斯林旅客訪港。

在專業認證服務方面，現時本地業界提供的專業認證服務已由電子電氣產品、建築材料等傳統產業拓展到環境、社會及管治、綠色金融等新興領域。政府一直和香港檢測和認證局緊密合作，透過多元化的線上線下宣傳和研討會等活動，協助業界針對性地推廣認證服務，發掘新商機。

在金融創新方面，為促進數字資產行業的可持續發展，繼政府在二○二三年六月實施數字資產交易平台發牌制度，《穩定幣條例》亦會於八月一日正式實施，為穩定幣發行人發牌訂下法定監管制度。政府亦正就其他數字資產活動規管範疇進行公眾諮詢，務求完善有關規管，助力市場健康發展。

在綠色產業方面，政府一直透過低碳綠色科研基金和「創新及科技基金」支援本地綠色科技發展，將具實際應用潛力的科研項目轉化為具商業價值的技術或產品，並在本地生產，長遠促進香港綠色產業發展。另外，香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融中心，正積極推動金融科技和綠色金融更好結合。其中，政府在「政府可持續債券計劃」下已成功發行合共約2,400億元等值的政府綠色債券，當中包括兩批代幣化綠色債券，分別是全球首批政府代幣化綠色債券及全球首批多貨幣計價數碼原生綠色債券，充分展示香港在結合債券市場、綠色和可持續金融，以及金融創新方面的優勢和領導地位。

在文化創意產業方面，政府正致力落實於去年十一月公布的《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，為經濟發展提供動力。其中一個發展方向是完善文藝創意產業生態圈，透過建立和拓展產業平台，促進跨界別和跨領域的合作。其中，政府以產業導向原則，培育具產業化潛質的文創項目，例如在剛完結的香港動漫電玩節中設立「香港國際潮玩博覽」、資助漫畫業界年度盛事「國際漫畫家大會」及「國際漫畫展」等，展現香港作為亞洲創意之都的地位，全方位支援產業化發展。

在體育產業方面，近年香港體育產業的規模正穩步擴展。根據二○二四年八月公布的資料，體育及相關活動在二○二二年以基本價格計算的增加價值約為380億元，較五年前增加11.8%。政府除了加強對精英運動員的支援和透過「M」品牌計劃吸引國際體育盛事在香港舉行，啟德體育園的落成為推動體育和周邊產業注入新動力，在推動本港體育全面發展的同時，帶動娛樂、演出及旅遊業等相關產業的發展，對促進體育產業化和推動經濟發揮積極作用。

結語

代主席，今日的議案涵蓋多個政策範疇，政府相關政策局和部門會通力合作，為有利經濟發展的範疇致力提供合適的政策和環境，我們亦非常歡迎議員的寶貴建議。接下來，我會細心聆聽各位議員的意見，稍後在總結發言時再詳細回應。代主席，我謹此陳辭。"
立法會：署理勞工及福利局局長就「完善灣區人才標準，促進區域人才流動」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 18:18,2025-07-30 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000683.htm,"以下是署理勞工及福利局（勞福局）局長何啟明今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議就「完善灣區人才標準，促進區域人才流動」議員議案的總結發言全文：

代主席：

我再次感謝顏汶羽議員提出這項議案，以及梁子穎議員提出的修正案。同時，我感謝在座議員就這項議題表逹的意見及提出的建議，我會在此簡略回應。

正如我在開場發言所說，特區政府一直採取多管齊下的策略，以培育本地人才為主，引入外來人才為輔，豐富香港的人才庫，增強香港發展動能，主動對接國家「十四五」規劃及粵港澳大灣區建設，加快融入國家發展大局。

大灣區內城市有不同的優勢和定位，在人才培養、招攬、交流等方面有廣闊的合作空間。為了共同建設粵港澳大灣區人才高地，很多政策局及部門一直就相關行業致力推動香港與其他大灣區城市的專業人才發展、便捷兩地專業人才資格互認及強化相關標準銜接的工作，包括律政司、發展局、教育局、環境及生態局、醫務衞生局、房屋局、財經事務及庫務局以及勞福局。各政策局及部門都非常重視和關心灣區內人才流動的情況，會與相關行業的業界人士及團體緊密聯繫，了解行業最新發展及人力需求情況，並與其他大灣區城市負責單位商議，從而制定及優化相關措施。

在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》（CEPA）的框架下，內地已在絕大部分的服務貿易領域對香港實施優惠和便利措施，包括放寬香港專業人士提供服務的資質要求、准許香港專業人士在內地參加考試、註冊、執業和開業，以及鼓勵雙方的專業機構進行資格互認。目前，多個服務領域已設立專業資格互認或專業資格考試的考卷豁免安排，包括建築及相關工程、證券及期貨、銀行和房地產。

在建築及相關工程服務方面，正如剛才盧偉國議員提到，發展局與內地相關部門合作，允許合資格的香港工程、建築、測量、規劃和園境五個專業範疇的企業和專業人士，無須通過資格互認，只要完成簡單的備案程序，對應內地相應的資格，便可以到大灣區內地九市直接提供服務。另一方面，發展局與廣東省及澳門合作，就建造技術工人及技術人員的技術水平建立灣區標準，並推展「一試多證」安排。未來，我們會持續優化所需配套措施，支持粵港澳三地在建造業人才培育方面的合作，助力整個大灣區的建造業邁向更高質量發展。

在金融服務領域，政府一直致力建立金融人才庫，為業界創造發展動能。在CEPA框架下，內地與香港已就不同金融服務業的專業及行業資格推出開放措施，有利於內地金融人才來港發展。除了我較早前提到有關證券、基金及期貨行業，以及銀行業的資格互認機制，在會計專業方面，香港會計師公會與中國註冊會計師協會亦設有會計專業考試科目豁免安排。

地產代理服務方面，兩地的規管機構可分別推薦合資格地產代理及房地產經紀人參加由對方專門開設的培訓課程及考試。在完成課程及通過考試後，相關人士可申請在對方管轄範圍從事相關行業的資格。

在環境保護方面，香港在環境法規、國際認證及專業管理方面具有優勢。環境保護署（環保署）一直與相關專業學會合作，為環保相關科目的畢業生及年青環境專業人士提供實習培訓。剛才盧偉國議員提到，亦感謝你的推進，環保署計劃聯同香港合資格環保專業人員學會，與內地探索建立環保專業人員認證的可行性，以促進香港與大灣區內地城市的交流和合作。

而在爭議解決服務方面，粵港澳三地法律部門亦將爭取在今年內推出大灣區仲裁員名冊，以推動粵港澳大灣區仲裁員的人才連接，構建大灣區內多元化爭議解決機制。

代主席，雖然剛剛提到我們進行了許多工作，但當然很多工作仍有待推進，包括陳祖恒議員提到實習簽證的問題、周文港議員提到的學歷互認問題、黃俊碩議員提到「開小門而關小門」的問題，以及謝偉銓議員提到單一窗口的問題均仍待解決。然而，有些議員提出的問題我們已處理，包括剛才洪雯議員提到是否可透過香港引進國際領軍人才，其實今早在立法會前廳交流會上，政務司司長亦提到我們已釐定領軍人才引進機制，若各位議員物色到世界上頂尖的行業領軍人才，歡迎告訴我們，我們會主動出擊，以期將他們引來香港。

另外，黃錦輝議員提到能否讓職專學校的學生畢業後直接來港服務，其實在現行的職專畢業生留港計劃下已有類似操作安排，我們希望有更多非本地技術專才可以來到香港就讀職業訓練局，然後在港就業及紮根。我們會繼續與內地相關機構發展並完善類似安排。

政府各政策局及部門會繼續因應各行業最新發展及人力需求情況，制定及優化相應的培訓策略和措施，提升相關行業人才的職業和專業技能。此外，職業訓練局及僱員再培訓局亦提供全面的職業專才教育及培訓服務，提升本地勞動力的整體競爭力。

優質的人才是發展的重要動能，也是世界各地爭相競逐的對象。大灣區內城市各有不同優勢和定位，香港會繼續與其他大灣區城市攜手引才、留才、育才、用才，對接國家「十四五」規劃及粵港澳大灣區建設，加快融入國家發展大局。特區政府感謝各位議員對這項議題的重視和關心，各政策局和部門會繼續與業界人士及團體保持緊密溝通，並與其他大灣區城市負責單位聯繫和商議，推動香港與其他大灣區城市的專業人才發展、便捷兩地專業人才資格互認及強化相關標準銜接的工作，促進區域人才流動。

多謝主席。"
立法會二十題：發展九龍城區海濱,2025-07-30 18:15,2025-07-30 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000624.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上李慧琼議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為隨着《2024年保護海港（修訂）條例草案》於本年五月獲本會通過，以及當局已邀請香港鐵路有限公司研究將紅磡站南面的臨海及前碼頭用地打造成設有遊艇會的海濱新地標，九龍城區海濱可望透過連接黃埔、土瓜灣和啟德等地區而得以貫通，而海濱區更可延伸至尖沙咀和觀塘海濱長廊，是政府建立「全民海濱」的重要契機。同時，由於啟德體育園落成及啟德跑道區持續發展，海濱區將吸引大量市民及遊客，周邊區域的交通配套及接駁設施的需求將大幅增加。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有何具體方案和時間表處理現時九龍城區海濱的斷點問題，包括翔龍灣煤氣調壓站、海心公園魚尾石一帶及青洲英泥碼頭私人地段；

（二）如何評估現時啟德區（尤其是跑道區）交通配套的不足之處；有何計劃改善該區的交通連接，包括水上交通和陸路接駁，以提升區域暢達性及應對大型盛事舉辦時的人流需求；

（三）如何解決舊區與海濱之間連接不足的問題；會否與市區重建局協調，在重建項目中加強行人系統網絡，以提升舊區與海濱的連接性；

（四）當局有何初步構思善用九龍城海濱水域資源；會否考慮發展水上活動設施，以配合啟德體育園及「青年驛站」旅舍的建設；及

（五）如何評估九龍城區的歷史文化資源與海濱發展的協同效應；有何計劃將該區內的歷史文化元素融入海濱發展？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直與海濱事務委員會緊密合作，推動各項優化維港海濱的工作，為公眾營造多元、活力、暢達和共融的海濱空間。就李議員關注的尖沙咀至啟德海濱發展而言，在長約15公里的可發展海濱長廊當中，目前已駁通將近七成，二○二八年年底將駁通近八成半。此外，我們會持續提升區內的海濱設施，例如於七月中開放紅磡都市公園（第二期），最近亦建議在發展紅磡站周邊和海濱一帶用地時，在紅磡繞道底臨海一段進行小規模填海工程，善用修訂的《保護海港條例》（第531章）的拆牆鬆綁機制興建新行人板道以連接尖沙咀海濱長廊與紅磡海濱長廊，以及優化海濱與內陸的行人連接，加強區域暢達性。

就提問各部分，經諮詢運輸及物流局、文化體育及旅遊局、民政及青年事務局和九龍城民政事務處後，現回覆如下：

（一）就李議員提及的三個地點，發展局目前有以下構思：

（i）海心公園內魚尾石一帶的海濱：魚尾石臨海一段是維港兩岸僅存的自然海岸線之一，我們認為應予以保留，現階段沒有計劃進行填海工程。現時魚尾石後方已設有行人通道連接海心公園擴建部分的海濱長廊，我們會繼續與康樂及文化事務署探討優化現有行人通道的方案及可行性，進一步改善魚尾石一帶海濱的通達性。

（ii）土瓜灣翔龍灣對開臨海煤氣設施用地：現時該臨海位置的煤氣調壓站及用作運送煤氣原材料石腦油的碼頭仍在運作中。我們與業權人一直保持溝通，探討在不影響上述設施的情況下開通一條行人通道的可能性。土木工程拓展署正就不同行人連接方案，進行定量風險評估，目標在今年內完成。

（iii）紅磡青洲英泥碼頭一帶海濱地段：所涉部分地段的業權已分散賣出，而且部分地段按地契享有進出航道的權利，因此要打通臨海地段存在較多複雜性，較另外兩個地點需要較長時間處理。政府會先探討以非填海的方案貫通該處一帶海濱，包括如業權人有意將用地作與海濱發展相符的用途，政府樂意共同探討可行方案，以期達致共贏的局面。然而，若最終證明這些非填海方案並不可行，我們會研究在該處興建涉及小規模填海工程的行人板道的可能性。

我們會繼續採用「先易後難」的處理方式，改善以上三個海濱地點的暢達性，並把它們納入我們將在短期內展開的「東九龍海濱長廊研究」，以研究進一步貫通相關海濱段落。

（二）運輸及物流局一直因應九龍城區海濱的整體規劃及項目落成進度，持續協調各公共交通營辦商提供服務。啟德發展區一帶現時已接駁至港鐵網絡，加上附近的主幹道和連接路（包括太子道東、承啟道、承豐道等）目前有超過50條巴士及專線小巴路線，方便區內居民往返港九新界各區。運輸署亦已計劃新增兩條專營巴士路線，由啟德郵輪碼頭開出，途經啟德跑道區，分別提供直達紅磡與尖沙咀的特快服務及前往宋皇臺站及啟德站的接駁服務。此外，運輸及物流局正全力推展啟德智慧綠色集體運輸系統，以連接啟德跑道區至啟德站。該局預計今年下半年為項目招標，以期在二○二六年批出合約。水路交通方面，現時「北角—觀塘—啟德」渡輪航線，於周末及公眾假期的航班會停靠啟德跑道區。

就應對於啟德體育園舉辦大型活動的人流需求上，運輸署會與啟德體育園、活動主辦單位及公共交通營運商等保持密切聯繫，在交通管理方面及早作出準備和部署。視乎活動的規模及觀眾的需要，政府及公共交通營運商會加強鐵路服務、開辦特別巴士服務（包括本地和跨境服務），以及協調加強的士服務。

（三）一直以來，發展局會與市區重建局（市建局）溝通和協調，為重建項目加強行人系統網絡，方便市民的日常生活，為社區帶來裨益。就土瓜灣方面，市建局於今年三月委聘顧問展開「土瓜灣海濱研究」，其中一個研究目的正是加強內陸與海濱空間連接，探討藉着市區更新項目改善舊區環境和道路網絡，加強土瓜灣舊區與海濱的連接性和暢達性。市建局預計顧問團隊將於下半年提交初期研究報告及可行性研究建議。我們會就如何加強內陸與海濱之間連接，與市建局協調合作。

（四）為了善用九龍城區及其附近地區的海濱資源，政府進行了不同工作。在發展水上活動設施方面，三個位於觀塘避風塘海濱用地的水上訓練中心已投入運作，近日有不同團體在該處附近水域舉辦各式各樣的本地及國際水上運動／康樂活動／訓練課程，善用該處水體，增添九龍東海旁的活力及吸引力。

在善用水體方面，發展局轄下的起動九龍東辦事處與海事處已共同制定《共享觀塘避風塘指引》，推廣船隻及水上康樂活動於非颱風日子安全共用避風塘。此外，海事處已於二○一八年將觀塘避風塘沿觀塘海濱花園的通航區由50米擴闊一倍至約100米，以䆁放更多空間作水上康樂活動。政府亦會繼續與相關持份者如體育總會及啟德「青年驛站」的營運團體保持緊密聯繫，以善用毗鄰的維港海濱和水體資源。

（五）由政務司副司長任組長的發展旅遊熱點工作組在今年五月公布九個旅遊熱點項目，當中包括「特色社區之香港龍城深度遊」。「深度遊」項目以《九龍城寨光影之旅》電影場景展為出發點，透過包裝並推介不同具特色的旅遊路線，延伸旅客在九龍城區內的體驗。九龍城區是多元文化與新舊共融的特色社區，九龍城民政事務處將善用區內的歷史文化資源，設計別具香港特色的深度旅遊體驗。旅遊路線將涵蓋不同的歷史文化主題，例如寨城歷史、泰潮文化、歷史古蹟以及啟德機場回憶等，吸引旅客和市民沿着主題路線探索不同景點，包括牛棚藝術村和海心公園等毗鄰海濱的歷史文化景點。隨着九龍城臨海用地陸續重建發展，包括香港房屋協會的資助房屋項目，以及毗鄰的市區重建項目，將提供更多優質公共空間予市民享用，我們會邀請有關發展單位積極考慮把九龍城區內歷史文化元素融入海濱的空間。"
LCQ20: Development of harbourfront of Kowloon City District,2025-07-30 18:15,2025-07-30 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000633.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Starry Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

There are views that as the Protection of the Harbour (Amendment) Bill 2024 was passed by this Council in May this year, and the authorities have invited the Mass Transit Railway Corporation Limited to conduct a study to develop the waterfront and former pier sites to the south of Hung Hom Station into a new harbourfront landmark with yacht club, it is hoped that the harbourfront of Kowloon City District can realise connectivity through linking up areas such as Whampoa, To Kwa Wan and Kai Tak, and that the harbourfront zone can even be extended to the harbourfront of Tsim Sha Tsui and Kwun Tong. This serves as an important opportunity for the Government to develop a ""Harbourfront for the People"". At the same time, given the completion of the Kai Tak Sports Park and the continuous development of the runway area of Kai Tak, the harbourfront zone will attract a large number of members of the public and tourists, and the demand for ancillary transport facilities and connection facilities in the surrounding areas will increase substantially. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the specific proposal and timetable for addressing the existing disconnection problem in the harbourfront of Kowloon City District, including the gas offtake station off Grand Waterfront, the vicinity of the Fishtail Rock in Hoi Sham Park, and the private section of the Green Island Cement Pier;

(2) how it evaluates the inadequacies of the existing ancillary transport facilities in Kai Tak area (especially the runway area); of the plans in place to improve transport connectivity in the area, including waterborne transport and land transport, so as to enhance the accessibility of the area and cope with the demand arising from pedestrian flow when mega events are taking place;

(3) how it will address inadequate connectivity between old districts and the harbourfront; whether it will coordinate with the Urban Renewal Authority to enhance the network of pedestrian systems in redevelopment projects, so as to enhance connectivity between old districts and the harbourfront;

(4) of the authorities' preliminary ideas on optimising the use of water resources at the harbourfront of Kowloon City; whether the development of water sports facilities will be considered for supporting the construction of the Kai Tak Sports Park and ""Youth Post"" hostel; and

(5) how it evaluates the synergy between the historical and cultural resources and harbourfront development in Kowloon City District; of the plans in place to incorporate the historical and cultural elements of the district into harbourfront development?

Reply:

President,

The Government has been working closely with the Harbourfront Commission to promote various initiatives to enhance the Victoria Harbourfront, with a view to creating a diversified, vibrant, accessible and inclusive harbourfront space for the public. Regarding the harbourfront development from Tsim Sha Tsui to Kai Tak that Dr the Hon Lee is concerned with, out of the developable promenade of approximately 15 kilometres, nearly 70 per cent has been connected so far, and around 85 per cent is expected to be connected by the end of 2028. In addition, we will continue to improve harbourfront facilities in the district, such as the opening of the Hung Hom Urban Park (Phase 2) in mid-July, as well as recent proposal to make good use of the streamlined mechanism under the amended Protection of the Harbour Ordinance (Cap. 531) to carry out small scale reclamation underneath the waterfront section of the Hung Hom Bypass when developing the sites around Hung Hom Station and waterfront areas, with a view to connecting the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront promenade with the Hung Hom waterfront promenade through construction of a new boardwalk, and also strengthening the pedestrian connectivity between the harbourfront and the inland areas for enhancing the accessibility across regions.

In consultation with the Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB), the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau and the Kowloon City District Office (KCDO), the reply to various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) Regarding the three locations mentioned by Dr the Hon Lee, the latest views of the Development Bureau (DEVB) are as follows:

(i) for the waterfront in the vicinity of the Fishtail Rock in Hoi Sham Park: We consider that being one of the only remaining natural shorelines along the Victoria Harbour, the waterfront section of Fishtail Rock should be retained and there are no plans for reclamation at this stage. Currently, there is a pedestrian connection behind the Fishtail Rock connecting to the promenade of the Hoi Sham Park Extension. We will continue to explore the options and feasibility for enhancing the existing pedestrian connection with the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, with a view to further improving the accessibility of the waterfront in the vicinity of the Fishtail Rock.

(ii) for the waterfront gas facility site off Grand Waterfront in To Kwa Wan: Currently, the gas offtake station and the jetty for transfer of naphtha, the raw material for production of gas, are still in operation. We have been liaising with the landowner to explore the possibility of providing a pathway at its lot under the condition that the operation of the above facilities would not be affected. The Civil Engineering and Development Department is conducting a quantitative risk assessment on various pedestrian connection options, with a target of completion within this year.

(iii) for the waterfront area near the Green Island Cement Pier in Hung Hom: Connecting the concerned waterfront area is more complex and requires more time to tackle than the other two locations due to the fact that the lots therein are under multiple ownership with various owners, and certain parts of these lots have access to the sea according to the relevant leases. The Government would at the moment explore non-reclamation options to connect the harbourfront area, including the case where the concerned owners intend to use the site for a purpose consistent with the harbourfront development, the Government is willing to explore feasible solutions collaboratively with a view to achieving a win-win situation. However, should the non-reclamation options be proven not feasible in the end, we will study the possibility of a boardwalk with small scale reclamation.

We will continue to adopt the approach of ""tackling the simple issues first before the difficult ones"" to improve accessibility of the three waterfront locations above, and will incorporate them into the Study on East Kowloon Harbourfront Trail to be commenced in the near future, to examine further connecting the relevant harbourfront sections.

(2) The TLB has been co-ordinating with various public transport operators to provide services in line with the overall planning and progress of the completion of the various projects along the Kowloon City harbourftont. The Kai Tak Development Area (KTDA) is now connected to the MTR network, and together with the main roads and connecting roads in its vicinity (including Prince Edward Road East, Shing Kai Road, Shing Fung Road, etc.) are currently served by over 50 franchised bus and green minibus (GMB) routes, making it convenient for residents to travel to and from different districts on the Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories. The Transport Department (TD) has also planned to introduce two new franchised bus routes, which will provide express service from the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal via the Kai Tak Runway Area (KTRA) to Hung Hom/Tsim Sha Tsui direct and connecting service to Sung Wong Toi Station and Kai Tak Station respectively. In addition, the TLB is implementing the Smart and Green Mass Transit System in Kai Tak (the Project) in full swing for connecting the KTRA to the Kai Tak Station. It is targeted to invite tender for the Project in the second half of 2025 for awarding the contract in 2026. In terms of water transport, currently the ""North Point–Kwun Tong–Kai Tak"" ferry route calls at the KTRA on weekends and public holidays.

To cope with the demand arising from pedestrian flow when mega events are taking place in the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP), the TD will maintain close communication with the KTSP, event organisers and public transport operators to make advance preparations and arrangements in terms of transportation management. Depending on the scale of events and the needs of the spectators, the Government and public transport operators will strengthen rail services, introduce special bus services (including local and cross-boundary services) and co-ordinate enhanced taxi services.

(3) The DEVB and the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) have all along been maintaining close communication and co-ordination to strengthen the pedestrian network in redevelopment projects, facilitating citizens' daily lives and benefiting the community. Regarding To Kwa Wan, the URA commissioned consultants in March this year to launch the To Kwa Wan Harbourfront Study. One of the study's objectives is to strengthen the connection between the inland area and the harbourfront, explore measures to improve the environment of old district and the road network through urban renewal projects, thereby enhancing the connectivity and accessibility between the To Kwa Wan old district and the harbourfront. The URA expected the consultant team to submit a preliminary study report and feasibility study proposals in the second half of this year. We will co-ordinate and join forces with the URA on exploring ways to enhance connectivity between inland areas and the waterfront.

(4) The Government has undertaken various initiatives to leverage harbourfront resources in the Kowloon City District and its adjacent areas. Regarding the development of water sports facilities, three water sports training centres at waterfront sites around the Kwun Tong Typhoon Shelter (KTTS) have come into operation. Recently, different organisations have organised a variety of local and international water sports/recreational activities/training courses at the water bodies near KTTS, effectively utilising the water bodies and enhancing the vibrancy and attractiveness of the Kowloon East waterfront.

In respect of making good use of the water bodies, the Energizing Kowloon East Office under the DEVB and the Marine Department have jointly promulgated the Guidelines for Co-using KTTS to promote water body co-use between vessels and water recreational activities in the KTTS during non-typhoon days. Besides, the Marine Department has widened the passageway in KTTS along Kwun Tong Promenade from 50 m to about 100 m in 2018 to allow more space for water recreational activities. The Government will continue to maintain close communication with relevant stakeholders, such as sports associations and the operator of the ""Youth Post"" in Kai Tak, to optimise the use of the adjacent Victoria Harbourfront and water resources.

(5) The Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, led by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, announced nine tourist hotspot projects in May 2025, among which is ""Featured community - In-depth travel in Kowloon City"". Taking the ""Kowloon Walled City: A Cinematic Journey"" Movie Set Exhibition as the starting point, this project curates and promotes several unique travel routes to enhance tourists' experience in Kowloon City District. Kowloon City District is a distinctive neighbourhood with multicultural background and the blend of old and new elements. The KCDO will leverage the historic and cultural resources in the district to design in-depth travel experiences that showcase the unique character of Hong Kong. These travel routes will feature various historical and cultural themes, such as the history of the Kowloon Walled City, Thai and Chiu Chow cultures, historic sites and the legacy of Kai Tak airport, and will encourage both tourists and the public to explore different attractions along the thematic routes, such as the Cattle Depot Artist Village and Hoi Sham Park, along with other historic and cultural attractions adjacent to the harbourfront. With the progressive redevelopment of waterfront sites in Kowloon City, including the subsidised housing projects of the Hong Kong Housing Society and the urban renewal initiatives nearby, more quality public spaces will be provided for public enjoyment. We will invite the relevant development bodies to actively consider incorporating the historical and cultural elements of the Kowloon City District into the harbourfront spaces."

LCQ14: Measures to assist young people in home ownership,2025-07-30 18:05,2025-07-30 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000565.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Leung and a written reply by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, who is undertaking the duties of the Secretary for Housing, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

 In recent years, the current-term Government has actively encouraged young people to move up the housing ladder and has put in place a number of measures to assist young people in home ownership. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) among the applicants for the White Form Secondary Market Scheme 2024 (WSM 2024), of the number of young applicants under the Youth Scheme (WSM) and their percentage, with a breakdown by age group (i.e. aged 18 to 29 and aged 30 to 39);

(2) out of the 6 000 quota under WSM 2024, of the number of those ultimately allocated to applicants aged under 40; whether the authorities will further increase the quota for the Youth Scheme (WSM) in the light of the response received and the demand of young people for home ownership;

(3) whether it has compiled statistics on the respective numbers of applications for 80 per cent and 90 per cent loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage loans under the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) in each of the past five years, and the respective percentages of such numbers in the total number of new mortgage loans approved each year; among the applicants for 80 per cent and 90 per cent LTV mortgage loans, of the number of young applicants aged under 40;

(4) given that the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) announced in August last year a new arrangement, in which a waiver of the owner occupancy requirement under MIP will be granted to an eligible homeowner (such as a homeowner's family expecting newborn(s), resulting in a change in housing needs) for renting out the property, whether the Government knows if HKMCI will consider enhancing such measure (such as expanding the eligibility criteria from families with newborn(s) to include families with young child or children as well), thereby enabling more young families to change residence based on family needs;

(5) as it is learnt that some young families who previously acquired mortgage loans with a high LTV ratio through MIP find it difficult to replace their properties due to property price adjustments, and some even find themselves in negative equity, thus affecting their life planning, whether the Government has conducted surveys and studies, compiled statistics, and monitored on how such situation has impacted young families, and taken timely measures to prevent the problem from worsening; and

(6) whether it will further assist young people in home ownership under the subsidised housing policies, such as adjusting the proportion of subsidised housing supply, extending the Youth Scheme to subsidised housing provided by the Hong Kong Housing Society, and increasing the annual number of applications that can be made for subsidised housing and the proportion of larger flats available, thereby making subsidised housing an important channel for young people to purchase their first home?

Reply:

President,

 Since taking office, the current-term Government has actively implemented multiple measures to ""enhance speed, quantity, efficiency and quality"" in public housing supply. With our unremitting efforts, the problem of back-loaded public housing supply has completely turned around. Coupled with 30 000 Light Public Housing units, the total public housing supply in the coming five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30) will reach 197 000 units, which is 85 per cent higher than that of the first five year period since the current-term Government took office (i.e. 2022-23 to 2026-27), providing a solid foundation for citizens to live and work in contentment. The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has also been striving to enhance the housing ladder by assisting low- to middle-income families to purchase their own homes through the sale of subsidised sale flats (SSF), and encouraging them to move up the housing ladder as appropriate according to their own affordability.

 We notice that many young people are working hard to achieve upward mobility through accumulation of experience and savings. Among buyers of various types of SSF, young people under the age of 40 have always been the majority. For instance, nearly half of the successful applicants for first-hand Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats are under the age of 40. Around 80 per cent of applicants and buyers under the White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) are also young people under the age of 40. In fact, the selling prices of SSF are affordable for young people. Taking HOS 2024 as an example, after applying the affordability benchmarks calculation, the flats are sold at around 70 per cent of the market price. Based on the average selling price, a flat of about 380 square feet in saleable area costs only around $2.7 million. As the HA provides a mortgage default guarantee for buyers of SSF, generally, White Form buyers can secure a mortgage loan at 90 per cent of the flat price. Assuming an interest rate at 3.5 per cent and a 30-year mortgage term, young people would only need to make a down payment of about $270,000, with monthly mortgage payments of $10,900, to become homeowners.

 To further assist young people, the HA has introduced a series of measures to facilitate their flat purchase. First, starting from the next HOS sale exercise, the HA will allocate an extra ballot number to young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 with White Form status. As for the secondary market, starting from WSM 2024, the HA has increased the quota to 6 000 by 1 500, all of which will be allocated to young family and one-person applicants under the age of 40.

 Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS), as a close partner of the Government in housing policies, also fully supports the Government's relevant housing initiatives in helping young people realise their home ownership aspirations, including the allocation of an additional ballot number to White Form young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 for the purchase of SSF. The HKHS will continue to make reference to the relevant arrangements of the HA and actively work towards the same.

 In addition, the Government also assists those higher-income persons who are not eligible for HOS and yet cannot afford private housing to achieve their home ownership aspirations through Starter Homes for Hong Kong Residents (SH) projects. Apart from the first two SH projects offered for sale by the Urban Renewal Authority (i.e. eResidence Towers 1 and 2, as well as eResidence Tower 3) with a total of over 600 SH units sold, the Government is also taking forward a few other SH projects, which will provide a total of around 5 000 SH units from the next few years onwards. Amongst applicants and final purchasers of SH units offered for sale in the past, around 85 per cent were youth aged 40 or below.

 Besides providing various types of subsidised housing, the Government has also implemented other measures to assist citizens in home purchase. The current-term Government has since February 2024 abolished all demand-side management measures for residential properties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also since October 2024 adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans. The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit were reverted to the pre-2009 levels before the countercyclical macroprudential measures were first introduced, with the maximum LTV ratio for all residential properties adjusted to 70 per cent, regardless of the value of the property, and the DSR limit adjusted to 50 per cent, providing facilitation to persons with different needs for property purchase. Individuals may also obtain high LTV ratio mortgage loans through the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) according to their own needs. In particular, for first-time homebuyers with regular income purchasing properties priced at $10 million or below, the LTV ratio can be up to 90 per cent, which greatly reduces their down payment burden. Meanwhile, to provide comprehensive support for citizens and young people who have aspirations in purchasing flats, the Government has since February 26, 2025 adjusted the value bands of Ad Valorem Stamp Duty payable for sale and purchase or transfer of residential and non-residential properties, raising the maximum value of properties chargeable to $100 stamp duty from $3 million to $4 million. As for SSF, since most units are priced below $4 million (taking HOS 2024 as an example, the average selling price is around $2.7 million), buyers may thus benefit from the aforementioned reduction in stamp duty to $100, with savings to nearly $60,000.

 In consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, our reply to the questions raised by the Hon Kenneth Leung is as follows:

(1) During the application period of WSM 2024, the HA received a total of around 34 000 applications. The oversubscription rate is about five times, reflecting the persistent strong demand for second hand SSF of citizens. Among all of the applications received, over 80 per cent came from young applicants opting to join the newly implemented Youth Scheme (WSM), showing that the scheme was well received by the young applicants. Regarding the number and age distribution of young applicants who opted for the Youth Scheme (WSM) under WSM 2024, please refer to Annex 1.

(2) Balloting for WSM 2024 was conducted in April 2025. The HA expects that approval letters will be issued to successful applicants in the third/fourth quarter of 2025. Within the specified period, holders of the approval letters may apply for Certificate of Eligibility to Purchase (valid for 12 months) to purchase a SSF with premium unpaid. The HA will continuously monitor factors including the quota utilisation, demand for SSF, overall market conditions, etc, to make timely adjustments to both the total number of quota and the allocations under the Youth Scheme (WSM).

(3) The MIP is administered by the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) for promoting home ownership in Hong Kong. When approving residential mortgage loans, banks have to comply with LTV requirement on owner-occupied residential mortgage lending, which is currently set at 70 per cent. With the MIP providing mortgage insurance to banks, banks can provide mortgage loans with higher LTV ratio (i.e. above 70 per cent) without incurring additional credit risk. As long as an application meets the relevant eligibility criteria, the bank can generally provide a mortgage loan of up to 80 per cent LTV ratio under the MIP. For first-time homebuyers with fixed salaries, the maximum LTV ratio can even reach 90 per cent, substantially reducing the down payment burden for homebuyers.

 The numbers of new loans drawn down under the MIP in the past five years (categorised by LTV ratio), and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 2.

 Among above new loans drawn down, the numbers of cases involving at least one homeowner aged below 40, and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (categorised by LTV ratio) (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 3.

(4) In August 2024, the HKMCI put in place a new arrangement under the MIP to approve on a case-by-case basis eligible homeowners' applications for renting out their self-occupied properties, so as to help them meet their special needs arising from changes in personal or family circumstances (new arrangement). The new arrangement has been implemented for around one year smoothly, offering substantial assistance to homeowners with special needs. Under the new arrangement, in addition to the situation that the homeowner's family is expecting newborn(s)/adopting child or children or the homeowner has become unemployed, any homeowner who has other special needs and has been residing in the relevant property for not less than 12 months may also submit an application to the HKMCI through a bank for renting out the self-occupied property. The existing mechanism already allows homeowners who have young children and are able to meet the self-occupancy requirement to submit applications for renting out their self-occupied properties based on their special needs. The HKMCI will consider approving the relevant applications on a case-by-case basis.

(5) The objective of the MIP is to promote home ownership and provide citizens with an additional option for financing. As the fluctuation of the property market is subject to various factors, citizens should take into consideration their needs for home ownership and repayment capability, and assess the risks carefully.

(6) As mentioned above, both the HA and the HKHS are making relentless efforts to optimise various arrangements to help young people with home ownership aspirations strive to climb onto the home ownership ladder. The Chief Executive announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the HA would adjust the ratio between public rental housing (PRH) (including Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme flats) and SSF from 7:3 to 6:4 in order to increase the supply of SSF. In the next five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30), the HA and the HKHS will complete about 56 500 SSF. Meanwhile, the HA is implementing the arrangement announced in the 2022 Policy Address regarding the minimum floor area for new flats. The saleable area of all SSF completed from 2026-27 onwards will be no less than 26 square metres in general. Furthermore, in the latter part of the coming decade, we will reserve 10 per cent increase in floor area for public housing. We are also exploring other measures to further assist young people in purchasing SSF and the measures will be launched in a timely manner. That said, we would like to take this opportunity to appeal to young people once again to unleash their potential and create a more prosperous future, but not to limit their room for development just for the sake of meeting the eligibility criteria for PRH application. In the past five years (i.e. 2020-21 to 2024-25), the average age of non-elderly one-person applicants that were housed to PRH was 57 years old. After understanding the above opportunities and support provided by the Government for young people, young people should plan ahead of time so as to climb higher up the housing ladder."

問題：

本屆政府近年積極鼓勵青年在房屋階梯向上流動，並採取多項措施協助青年置業。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）在「白表居屋第二市場計劃2024」（「白居二2024」）的申請者中，「青年計劃（白居二）」的青年申請者的人數及其所佔百分比為何，並按年齡組別（即18歲至29歲及30歲至39歲）列出分項資料；

（二）「白居二2024」的6 000個名額中，最終編配予40歲以下申請者的數目為何；當局會否因應該計劃的反應和青年的置業需求，進一步增加青年計劃（白居二）的名額；

（三）有否統計過去五年，每年按揭保險計劃（按保計劃）下的八成及九成按揭貸款的申請數目，以及該等數目佔每年新批出按揭貸款個案總數的百分比分別為何；八成及九成按揭貸款的申請者中，有多少人屬40歲以下青年；

（四）鑑於去年八月香港按證保險有限公司（按保公司）宣布一項新安排，合資格業主（例如業主家庭將有新生嬰兒而導致住屋要求改變）可獲豁免按保計劃下的業主自住要求並將物業出租，政府是否知悉按保公司會否考慮優化有關措施（例如將受惠資格由新生嬰兒家庭擴展至涵蓋有年幼子女家庭），從而使更多青年家庭可按家庭需要轉換居所；

（五）據悉部分以往利用按保計劃申請高成數按揭置業的青年家庭，因樓價調整而難以換樓，甚至出現負資產，影響其人生規劃，政府有否調研、統計及監察有關情況對青年家庭的影響，並適時作出措施防止問題惡化；及

（六）會否在資助房屋政策方面進一步協助青年置業，例如調整資助房屋供應比例、將青年計劃擴展至香港房屋協會的資助房屋，以及增加每年資助房屋可供申請次數及大單位的供應比例等，從而使資助房屋成為青年首次置業的重要渠道？

本屆政府自上任以來，積極推展多項針對公營房屋供應「提速、提量、提效、提質」的措施。在我們不懈努力下，公營房屋供應已扭轉了「頭輕尾重」的情況。連同30000個「簡約公屋」單位在內，未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），總體公營房屋供應量將達197000伙，較本屆政府上任時的五年期（即二○二二／二三至二○二六／二七年度），大幅增加超過85%，為市民安居樂業提供堅實的基礎。香港房屋委員會（房委會）亦一直致力完善房屋階梯，透過出售資助單位協助中低收入家庭自置居所，鼓勵他們按自己的能力選擇合適的房屋階梯上流。

我們留意到不少青年人均努力工作，透過累積經驗及儲蓄，向上流動。在各類資助出售單位的買家中，40歲以下的青年人一直佔大多數。舉例而言，成功購買一手居者有其屋計劃（居屋）單位的申請者有近一半是40歲以下；約80%的「白表居屋第二市場計劃」（白居二）申請者及買家亦是40歲以下的青年人。事實上，資助出售單位的售價亦屬青年可負擔。以「居屋2024」為例，經以負擔能力基準計算後，單位是以相當於市價的七折發售。按平均售價計算，一個實用面積約380呎單位的售價只是約270萬元。由於房委會為購買資助出售單位的人士提供按揭貸款保證，一般而言白表買家可以取得單位售價九成的按揭貸款。以上述380呎的單位為例，假設利息為3.5%和按揭還款期為30年，青年只需付出約27萬元首期和每月供款10,900元，便可成為業主。

為進一步協助青年人，房委會推出了一系列助力置業的措施。首先，由下一期居屋銷售計劃開始，房委會會為40歲以下的白表青年家庭及一人申請者分派多一個抽籤號碼；而在第二市場方面，房委會亦已由「白居二2024」起，增加1500個配額至6000個，並將新增配額全數撥予40歲以下的青年家庭及一人申請者。

與此同時，香港房屋協會（房協）作為政府在房屋政策方面的緊密合作伙伴，亦全力支持政府在協助青年置業的相關房屋政策措施，包括為申請購買資助出售房屋的40歲以下白表青年家庭及一人申請者分派多一個抽籤號碼。房協將繼續參考房委會的相關安排，並積極配合。

另外，政府亦透過「港人首次置業」（「首置」）項目，協助既不符合申請居屋資格、又未能負擔私營房屋的較高收入人士，達到他們的置業期望。除了市區重建局首兩個已推售的「首置」項目（即「煥然懿居」第一和第二座，以及「煥然懿居」第三座）共售出超過600個「首置」單位，政府正推展另外數個「首置」項目，於未來數年起合共提供約5000個「首置」單位。而過去所推售「首置」單位的申請人以及最終買家，有大約85%是40歲或以下青年。

除了提供不同類型的資助房屋外，政府亦推行了其他措施協助市民置業。本屆政府自二○二四年二月起撤銷所有住宅物業需求管理措施；香港金融管理局亦自二○二四年十月起修訂了物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，將最高物業按揭成數和「供款與入息比率」上限回復至二○○九年開始實施逆周期措施以前的水平——即不論物業價值，按揭成數上限一律調整至70%，供款與入息比率上限一律調整為50%——以便利不同置業需要的人士。個別人士更可按自身需要，透過按揭保險計劃（按保計劃）借取高成數的按揭貸款，其中有固定收入的首次置業人士購置價格1,000萬元或以下的物業，按揭成數可高達90%，大大減輕首期負擔。同時，政府自二○二五年二月二十六日起調整買賣或轉讓住宅及非住宅物業須繳付的從價印花稅的稅階，將徵收100元物業印花稅適用的物業價值上限由300萬元提高至400萬元，全方位協助有意置業的市民及青年。就資助出售單位而言，由於絕大部分單位的定價均低於400萬元（以「居屋2024」為例，單位平均售價為270萬元），買家已能受惠於上述印花稅降至100元的措施，最多可以節省近60,000元。

就梁毓偉議員的提問，經諮詢財經事務及庫務局，我們現回覆如下：

（一）在「白居二2024」申請期內，房委會共收到約34000份申請，超額申請約為五倍，顯示市民對二手資助出售單位的需求持續殷切。所有申請中，超過80%為選擇參加今期新推出「青年計劃（白居二）」的青年申請者，反映計劃相當受青年申請者歡迎。有關於「白居二2024」選擇參加「青年計劃（白居二）」的青年申請者數目及年齡分布，詳見附件一。

（二）「白居二2024」已於2025年4月攪珠，房委會預計會於二○二五年第三／四季向成功申請者發出批准信。批准信持有人可在指定日期內申請「購買資格證明書」（有效期12個月），以便購買未補價的資助出售單位。房委會會持續檢視配額使用情況、資助出售單位的需求，以及整體市場情況等因素，適時調整整體配額數量及「青年計劃（白居二）」名額。

（三）按保計劃由香港按證保險有限公司﹙按證保險公司）經營，以協助市民在香港安居置業。銀行在敍造住宅物業按揭貸款的時候，須遵守按揭成數上限的規定，而現時的按揭成數上限為70%。按保計劃則為銀行提供按揭保險，使銀行可以提供較高成數（即70%以上）的按揭貸款而毋須承擔額外的風險。在按保計劃下，只要申請個案符合相關條件，銀行一般可以提供高達80%的按揭貸款；對於首次置業的固定受薪人士，按揭成數更可達到90%。置業人士的首期負擔因而可以大大減輕。

過去五年，每年按保計劃下新取用按揭貸款宗數（以按揭成數劃分），以及該等數目佔每年新取用按揭貸款個案總數的百分比（即括號內所述數字）載列於附件二。

在上述新取用按揭貸款當中，涉及至少一名40歲以下業主的宗數，以及該等數目佔每年新取用按揭貸款個案宗數（以按揭成數劃分）的百分比（即括號內所述數字）載列於附件三。

（四）按證保險公司於二○二四年八月在按保計劃下設立新安排，按個別情況考慮批准合資格業主將自住的物業出租，以協助他們應付因個人或家庭處境轉變帶來的特別需要（新安排）。新安排推行接近一年，運作暢順，為有特別需要的業主提供實質協助。在新安排下，除了業主家庭將有新生嬰兒／領養兒童或業主失業的情況，業主如有其他特別需要而本身在相關物業已自住最少12個月，亦可透過銀行向按證保險公司申請將自住物業出租。現行機制已容許有年幼子女並滿足自住要求的業主，就其特別需要提出將自住物業出租的申請。按證保險公司會按個別情況考慮批准相關個案。

（五）按保計劃的目的是協助市民置業安居，為他們提供多一個財務安排選擇。物業市場的波動受許多不同因素影響，市民須因應自己置業的需要及還款能力作出考慮，小心評估風險。

（六）如上述所言，房委會及房協不遺餘力地優化各項安排，以協助有置業夢想的年輕人奮力向上，踏上置業階梯。行政長官已在二○二四年《施政報告》公布，房委會會調整公共租住房屋（公屋）（包括綠表置居計劃單位）和資助出售單位的比例，由七比三逐步調整至六比四，增加資助出售單位的供應。在未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），房委會和房協將共有約56500個資助出售單位落成。與此同時，房委會正落實二○二二年《施政報告》中有關新建單位面積「封底」的安排，即所有於二○二六／二七年度起落成的資助出售單位一般實用面積不會少於26平方米。此外，在未來十年期的較後時間，公營房屋的單位會預留10%的面積增長。我們亦正研究其他進一步協助青年購買資助房屋的措施，並會適時推出。然而，我們希望藉此機會再次呼籲年青人，應發揮潛力創造更豐盛的未來；萬勿為了符合申請公屋資格而限制自身的發展空間。過去五年（即二○二○／二一至二○二四／二五年度），獲編配公屋單位的非長者一人申請者平均年齡為57歲。青年人在了解上述政府為青年人提供的機會及支援後，應及早規劃以在房屋階梯攀得更高。"
LCQ14:Measures to assist young people in home ownership,2025-07-30 18:05,2025-07-30 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000565.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Leung and a written reply by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, who is undertaking the duties of the Secretary for Housing, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

 In recent years, the current-term Government has actively encouraged young people to move up the housing ladder and has put in place a number of measures to assist young people in home ownership. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) among the applicants for the White Form Secondary Market Scheme 2024 (WSM 2024), of the number of young applicants under the Youth Scheme (WSM) and their percentage, with a breakdown by age group (i.e. aged 18 to 29 and aged 30 to 39);

(2) out of the 6 000 quota under WSM 2024, of the number of those ultimately allocated to applicants aged under 40; whether the authorities will further increase the quota for the Youth Scheme (WSM) in the light of the response received and the demand of young people for home ownership;

(3) whether it has compiled statistics on the respective numbers of applications for 80 per cent and 90 per cent loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage loans under the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) in each of the past five years, and the respective percentages of such numbers in the total number of new mortgage loans approved each year; among the applicants for 80 per cent and 90 per cent LTV mortgage loans, of the number of young applicants aged under 40;

(4) given that the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) announced in August last year a new arrangement, in which a waiver of the owner occupancy requirement under MIP will be granted to an eligible homeowner (such as a homeowner's family expecting newborn(s), resulting in a change in housing needs) for renting out the property, whether the Government knows if HKMCI will consider enhancing such measure (such as expanding the eligibility criteria from families with newborn(s) to include families with young child or children as well), thereby enabling more young families to change residence based on family needs;

(5) as it is learnt that some young families who previously acquired mortgage loans with a high LTV ratio through MIP find it difficult to replace their properties due to property price adjustments, and some even find themselves in negative equity, thus affecting their life planning, whether the Government has conducted surveys and studies, compiled statistics, and monitored on how such situation has impacted young families, and taken timely measures to prevent the problem from worsening; and

(6) whether it will further assist young people in home ownership under the subsidised housing policies, such as adjusting the proportion of subsidised housing supply, extending the Youth Scheme to subsidised housing provided by the Hong Kong Housing Society, and increasing the annual number of applications that can be made for subsidised housing and the proportion of larger flats available, thereby making subsidised housing an important channel for young people to purchase their first home?

Reply:

President,

 Since taking office, the current-term Government has actively implemented multiple measures to ""enhance speed, quantity, efficiency and quality"" in public housing supply. With our unremitting efforts, the problem of back-loaded public housing supply has completely turned around. Coupled with 30 000 Light Public Housing units, the total public housing supply in the coming five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30) will reach 197 000 units, which is 85 per cent higher than that of the first five year period since the current-term Government took office (i.e. 2022-23 to 2026-27), providing a solid foundation for citizens to live and work in contentment. The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has also been striving to enhance the housing ladder by assisting low- to middle-income families to purchase their own homes through the sale of subsidised sale flats (SSF), and encouraging them to move up the housing ladder as appropriate according to their own affordability.

 We notice that many young people are working hard to achieve upward mobility through accumulation of experience and savings. Among buyers of various types of SSF, young people under the age of 40 have always been the majority. For instance, nearly half of the successful applicants for first-hand Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats are under the age of 40. Around 80 per cent of applicants and buyers under the White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) are also young people under the age of 40. In fact, the selling prices of SSF are affordable for young people. Taking HOS 2024 as an example, after applying the affordability benchmarks calculation, the flats are sold at around 70 per cent of the market price. Based on the average selling price, a flat of about 380 square feet in saleable area costs only around $2.7 million. As the HA provides a mortgage default guarantee for buyers of SSF, generally, White Form buyers can secure a mortgage loan at 90 per cent of the flat price. Assuming an interest rate at 3.5 per cent and a 30-year mortgage term, young people would only need to make a down payment of about $270,000, with monthly mortgage payments of $10,900, to become homeowners.

 To further assist young people, the HA has introduced a series of measures to facilitate their flat purchase. First, starting from the next HOS sale exercise, the HA will allocate an extra ballot number to young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 with White Form status. As for the secondary market, starting from WSM 2024, the HA has increased the quota to 6 000 by 1 500, all of which will be allocated to young family and one-person applicants under the age of 40.

 Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS), as a close partner of the Government in housing policies, also fully supports the Government's relevant housing initiatives in helping young people realise their home ownership aspirations, including the allocation of an additional ballot number to White Form young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 for the purchase of SSF. The HKHS will continue to make reference to the relevant arrangements of the HA and actively work towards the same.

 In addition, the Government also assists those higher-income persons who are not eligible for HOS and yet cannot afford private housing to achieve their home ownership aspirations through Starter Homes for Hong Kong Residents (SH) projects. Apart from the first two SH projects offered for sale by the Urban Renewal Authority (i.e. eResidence Towers 1 and 2, as well as eResidence Tower 3) with a total of over 600 SH units sold, the Government is also taking forward a few other SH projects, which will provide a total of around 5 000 SH units from the next few years onwards. Amongst applicants and final purchasers of SH units offered for sale in the past, around 85 per cent were youth aged 40 or below.

 Besides providing various types of subsidised housing, the Government has also implemented other measures to assist citizens in home purchase. The current-term Government has since February 2024 abolished all demand-side management measures for residential properties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also since October 2024 adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans. The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit were reverted to the pre-2009 levels before the countercyclical macroprudential measures were first introduced, with the maximum LTV ratio for all residential properties adjusted to 70 per cent, regardless of the value of the property, and the DSR limit adjusted to 50 per cent, providing facilitation to persons with different needs for property purchase. Individuals may also obtain high LTV ratio mortgage loans through the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) according to their own needs. In particular, for first-time homebuyers with regular income purchasing properties priced at $10 million or below, the LTV ratio can be up to 90 per cent, which greatly reduces their down payment burden. Meanwhile, to provide comprehensive support for citizens and young people who have aspirations in purchasing flats, the Government has since February 26, 2025 adjusted the value bands of Ad Valorem Stamp Duty payable for sale and purchase or transfer of residential and non-residential properties, raising the maximum value of properties chargeable to $100 stamp duty from $3 million to $4 million. As for SSF, since most units are priced below $4 million (taking HOS 2024 as an example, the average selling price is around $2.7 million), buyers may thus benefit from the aforementioned reduction in stamp duty to $100, with savings to nearly $60,000.

 In consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, our reply to the questions raised by the Hon Kenneth Leung is as follows:

(1) During the application period of WSM 2024, the HA received a total of around 34 000 applications. The oversubscription rate is about five times, reflecting the persistent strong demand for second hand SSF of citizens. Among all of the applications received, over 80 per cent came from young applicants opting to join the newly implemented Youth Scheme (WSM), showing that the scheme was well received by the young applicants. Regarding the number and age distribution of young applicants who opted for the Youth Scheme (WSM) under WSM 2024, please refer to Annex 1.

(2) Balloting for WSM 2024 was conducted in April 2025. The HA expects that approval letters will be issued to successful applicants in the third/fourth quarter of 2025. Within the specified period, holders of the approval letters may apply for Certificate of Eligibility to Purchase (valid for 12 months) to purchase a SSF with premium unpaid. The HA will continuously monitor factors including the quota utilisation, demand for SSF, overall market conditions, etc, to make timely adjustments to both the total number of quota and the allocations under the Youth Scheme (WSM).

(3) The MIP is administered by the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) for promoting home ownership in Hong Kong. When approving residential mortgage loans, banks have to comply with LTV requirement on owner-occupied residential mortgage lending, which is currently set at 70 per cent. With the MIP providing mortgage insurance to banks, banks can provide mortgage loans with higher LTV ratio (i.e. above 70 per cent) without incurring additional credit risk. As long as an application meets the relevant eligibility criteria, the bank can generally provide a mortgage loan of up to 80 per cent LTV ratio under the MIP. For first-time homebuyers with fixed salaries, the maximum LTV ratio can even reach 90 per cent, substantially reducing the down payment burden for homebuyers.

 The numbers of new loans drawn down under the MIP in the past five years (categorised by LTV ratio), and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 2.

 Among above new loans drawn down, the numbers of cases involving at least one homeowner aged below 40, and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (categorised by LTV ratio) (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 3.

(4) In August 2024, the HKMCI put in place a new arrangement under the MIP to approve on a case-by-case basis eligible homeowners' applications for renting out their self-occupied properties, so as to help them meet their special needs arising from changes in personal or family circumstances (new arrangement). The new arrangement has been implemented for around one year smoothly, offering substantial assistance to homeowners with special needs. Under the new arrangement, in addition to the situation that the homeowner's family is expecting newborn(s)/adopting child or children or the homeowner has become unemployed, any homeowner who has other special needs and has been residing in the relevant property for not less than 12 months may also submit an application to the HKMCI through a bank for renting out the self-occupied property. The existing mechanism already allows homeowners who have young children and are able to meet the self-occupancy requirement to submit applications for renting out their self-occupied properties based on their special needs. The HKMCI will consider approving the relevant applications on a case-by-case basis.

(5) The objective of the MIP is to promote home ownership and provide citizens with an additional option for financing. As the fluctuation of the property market is subject to various factors, citizens should take into consideration their needs for home ownership and repayment capability, and assess the risks carefully.

(6) As mentioned above, both the HA and the HKHS are making relentless efforts to optimise various arrangements to help young people with home ownership aspirations strive to climb onto the home ownership ladder. The Chief Executive announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the HA would adjust the ratio between public rental housing (PRH) (including Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme flats) and SSF from 7:3 to 6:4 in order to increase the supply of SSF. In the next five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30), the HA and the HKHS will complete about 56 500 SSF. Meanwhile, the HA is implementing the arrangement announced in the 2022 Policy Address regarding the minimum floor area for new flats. The saleable area of all SSF completed from 2026-27 onwards will be no less than 26 square metres in general. Furthermore, in the latter part of the coming decade, we will reserve 10 per cent increase in floor area for public housing. We are also exploring other measures to further assist young people in purchasing SSF and the measures will be launched in a timely manner. That said, we would like to take this opportunity to appeal to young people once again to unleash their potential and create a more prosperous future, but not to limit their room for development just for the sake of meeting the eligibility criteria for PRH application. In the past five years (i.e. 2020-21 to 2024-25), the average age of non-elderly one-person applicants that were housed to PRH was 57 years old. After understanding the above opportunities and support provided by the Government for young people, young people should plan ahead of time so as to climb higher up the housing ladder."
立法會十七題：維修大廈外牆,2025-07-30 17:30,2025-07-30 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000601.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上陳學鋒議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

有舊區樓宇單位業主向本人反映，本港不少大廈外牆的業權為該幢大廈的原發展商持有，但物業落成多年後，不少發展商已停止運作，部分該等發展商清盤後其持有的大廈外牆業權由政府接管，亦有部分大廈外牆無人管理變成「無主孤魂」而開始日久失修。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計全港有多少幢私人大廈的外牆沒有統一的業權持有人（包括部分或整體外牆業權不完整的大廈）；有多少幢私人大廈的外牆業權因發展商清盤而由政府接管，以及參與管理該等業權的政府部門為何，並按區議會分區列出該等大廈名稱及數目；

（二）政府如何處理第（一）項所述的外牆業權不完整的私人大廈及政府接管外牆業權的私人大廈所衍生的外牆維修責任，例如有否將政府管有的外牆業權以象徵式費用售予有關大廈的業主立案法團（法團）；若有，轉售業權的成功個案數目為何，以及有多少個法團拒絕接收該等外牆業權，並按區議會分區列出分項資料；

（三）有何措施確保外牆業權已由政府接收的大廈外牆結構安全；過去五年有否發生該等大廈外牆失修而導致途人受傷，並須政府承擔賠償責任的個案；若有，詳情為何；及

（四）政府如何處理屬第（一）項所述外牆業權不完整大廈而其外牆出現即時危險的情況；政府是否曾承擔有關維修責任並支付費用；若是，過往政府承擔的維修總金額為何，並按區議會分區列出分項資料？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直強調樓宇業主應妥善保養和維修樓宇，除了可延長樓宇的壽命，亦可避免因日久失修對住戶或公眾構成危險。一般而言，大廈公契作為私人合約訂明締約各方（即業主、經理人和發展商）之間的權利和責任，包括管理樓宇公用部分和其他相關事宜，以及相關維修費用的負擔等，部分公契亦會訂明外牆的業權和管理權。實際上，業主可透過成立業主立案法團（法團）、業主委員會，以及聘用持牌物業管理公司的方式，管理大廈公用部分（包括外牆）以及其他相關事宜。

《建築物管理條例》（第344章）亦有對管理和維修物業公用部分的責任作出規定。另外，市區重建局推行的樓宇復修綜合支援計劃，為樓宇業主提供財政資助和技術支援的一站式服務，包括支援業主為樓宇公用地方進行全面復修工程。民政事務總署亦會協助及支援法團，協助他們處理樓宇的管理事宜（包括樓宇外牆維修）。

就陳議員各部分的提問，經諮詢民政及青年事務局後，現回覆如下：

（一）由於樓宇不同部分的業權及其公用部分的管理責任由公契訂明，屬於私人合約協議，政府沒有統計全港有多少幢私人大廈的外牆沒有統一的業權持有人（包括部分或整體外牆業權不完整的大廈）。

由公司持有的物業，如果該公司根據《公司條例》（第622章）或《公司（清盤及雜項條文）條例》（第32章）完成清盤程序並面臨解散，則在緊接解散前歸屬該公司或以信託形式為該公司持有的所有財產及權利（例如包括一些仍未在市場售出的物業），即屬無主財物並歸屬政府，其中的土地物業，即為「無主物業」（包括大廈外牆）。地政總署一般會以出售方式處理上述屬無主財物並歸屬政府的大廈外牆（無主外牆）的業權（詳見第二部分）。仍未售出的無主外牆，則會由地政總署繼續管理。

截至二○二五年六月，被地政總署接管並仍由其管理的無主外牆個案共有56宗，（按區議會分區）詳情載列於附件一。由於部分由地政總署接管的無主外牆只佔外牆整體業權的一部分，地政總署會根據大廈公契，按其接管的外牆的權益份額而承擔相應的管理及維修責任。

（二）地政總署一般會以出售方式處理其接管的無主物業，但由於外牆的業權不適合在公開市場出售，署方一般會邀請相關的大廈法團以象徵式費用（即1,000元）承接無主外牆的業權。自二○一○年至今，地政總署已成功將24宗無主外牆的業權轉售相關大廈法團，有關大廈名單詳列於附件二。

至於在第（一）部分提及的56宗現由地政總署管理的無主外牆個案中，地政總署已就當中13宗正式邀請大廈法團承接業權，但尚待相關法團回覆，有關樓宇大廈名單詳列於附件三；地政總署另正就42宗安排與相關法團就轉讓事宜進行初步磋商；餘下一宗個案則因大廈未有成立法團而暫未有轉售的計劃。至今沒有法團明確拒絕地政總署就無主外牆個案發出的邀請，地政總署會繼續與相關法團磋商轉讓事宜。

若果有大廈的外牆業權不統一（即並非由單一業主或公司持有）或不完整（例如有個別業權不清），一般而言，業主須根據大廈公契，由法團或業主共同磋商及承擔有關外牆管理及維修的責任。

（三）就由地政總署管理的無主外牆而言，地政總署的責任與其他業主無異。地政總署人員會定期視察外牆的狀況，如有需要，會安排工程承辦商進行適當維修，以確保其結構安全及妥當。根據地政總署的紀錄，由地政總署管理的無主外牆過往從未出現因失修以致途人受傷的個案。

（四）屋宇署一直採取多管齊下的措施保障私人樓宇的建築安全。不論業權狀況如何，如發現樓宇包括外牆對公眾構成即時危險，署方會安排政府承建商進行緊急工程，並在完成緊急工程後向業主追討工程的相關費用、監督費及附加費。換言之，有關費用最終應該是由業主而非署方承擔。

就上述第（一）部分提及由地政總署管理的無主外牆，並沒有出現即時危險而需由屋宇署介入或代維修的個案。"
LCQ17: Repair and maintenance of external walls of buildings,2025-07-30 17:30,2025-07-30 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000592.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hok-fung and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

Some flat owners of buildings in old districts have relayed to me that titles to the external walls of many buildings in Hong Kong are held by the original developers of those buildings. However, quite a number of these developers have ceased operations over the years following completion of the buildings. The Government has assumed ownership of the external walls of buildings held by some of such developers after their liquidation. There are also cases in which the external walls of buildings are left unattended, be turned into ""abandoned structures"" and become dilapidated. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

President,

The Government has all along been emphasising that building owners should properly maintain and repair their buildings. Apart from extending the life of their buildings, danger to the occupants or the general public arising from dilapidation can also be avoided. Generally speaking, the Deeds of Mutual Covenant (DMCs) of a building, being a private contract, stipulate the rights and obligations among the parties concerned (i.e. owners, managers and developers), including management of the common parts of buildings and other related matters, as well as bearing of the relevant maintenance costs, etc. Some DMCs also specify the titles to and the management right of external walls. In fact, owners may manage the common parts (including external walls) of their buildings and other related matters by forming owners' corporations (OCs), owners' committees and engaging licensed property management companies.

The Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) also stipulates the responsibilities for management and maintenance of the common parts of a property. Moreover, the Urban Renewal Authority has launched an all-in-one Integrated Building Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme, providing financial assistance and technical support to building owners, including support for owners to carry out comprehensive maintenance works for the common areas of their buildings. The Home Affairs Department also provides assistance and support to OCs in handling building management matters (including maintenance of the external walls of buildings).

Our reply, prepared in consultation with the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Chan is as follows:

(1) As the titles to different parts of buildings and the responsibilities for managing their common parts are stipulated in the DMCs, which are private contractual agreements, the Government has not compiled statistics on the number of private buildings in Hong Kong where titles to their external walls are not unified (including buildings with incomplete titles to part or the whole of their external walls).

For properties owned by companies, if the company, pursuant to the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) or the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32), completes the procedures for winding up and is about to dissolve, every property and right (such as including some properties that are yet to be sold in the market) vested in or held on trust for the company immediately before the dissolution is vested in the Government as bona vacantia. Among these, land properties are ""bona vacantia properties"" (including their external walls). In general, the Lands Department (LandsD) will dispose of the titles to the external walls (bona vacantia external walls) of the aforesaid buildings which are vested in the Government as bona vacantia by way of sale (please see part (2) for details). Unsold bona vacantia external walls will continue to be managed by the LandsD.

As of June 2025, there are a total of 56 cases involving bona vacantia external walls which have been taken over and are still managed by the LandsD, the details of which (by District Council district) are set out at Annex 1. Given some of the bona vacantia external walls taken over by the LandsD only account for a portion of the overall ownership of the external walls, the LandsD will shoulder the management and maintenance responsibilities corresponding to its share of interests in the external walls in accordance with the DMCs.

(2) In general, the LandsD will dispose of bona vacantia properties that it has taken over by way of sale. However, as the titles to external walls are not suitable for sale in the open market, the LandsD will normally invite the OC of the buildings concerned to take over the ownership of bona vacantia external walls at a nominal fee (i.e. $1,000). Since 2010, the LandsD has successfully transferred the titles of 24 cases of bona vacantia external walls to the OCs of the buildings concerned by sale. A list of these buildings is set out at Annex 2.

Among the 56 cases of bona vacantia external walls currently managed by the LandsD as mentioned in part (1), the LandsD has officially invited the OCs of the buildings concerned to take over the titles of 13 cases, but the OCs have yet to respond. A list of the buildings concerned is set out at Annex 3. The LandsD is arranging initial negotiation with the relevant OCs regarding the transfer of titles for the other 42 cases. As for the remaining case, there is no plan for transfer for the time being as no OC has been formed in the building. So far, no OC has explicitly rejected the offer regarding bona vacantia external walls, and the LandsD will continue to negotiate with the relevant OCs on the transfer matters.

Generally speaking, for buildings where titles to their external walls are not unified (i.e. not held by a single owner or company) or are incomplete (e.g. individual titles are unclear), the OCs or the owners should jointly negotiate and bear the responsibilities for management and maintenance of external walls in accordance with the DMCs.

(3) For bona vacantia external walls managed by the LandsD, the department bears the same responsibilities as other owners. The LandsD staff will inspect the conditions of external walls on a regular basis and, if necessary, will arrange for works contractors to carry out repairs as appropriate to ensure their structural safety and that they are in a good state. According to the records of the LandsD, there has not been any case of injuries to pedestrians due to dilapidation of bona vacantia external walls under its management.

(4) The Buildings Department (BD) has been adopting a multi-pronged approach to ensure the safety of private buildings. Regardless of ownership status, if it is found that a building, including its external walls, poses an imminent danger to the public, the BD will arrange for government contractors to carry out emergency works and subsequently recover the relevant works costs, supervision fees, and surcharges from the owners. In other words, the relevant fees should be ultimately borne by the owners, rather than the BD.

Regarding the bona vacantia external walls managed by the LandsD mentioned in part (1) above, none of the concerned cases require intervention or repair works by the BD due to imminent danger."
