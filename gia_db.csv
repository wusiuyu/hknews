Inaugural individualised school health reports to be released under extended Whole School Health Programme,2025-08-18 17:45,2025-08-18 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800711.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) announced today (August 18) that it will release the inaugural ""School Health Reports and Recommendations"" (health reports) tailored to each participating school under the Whole School Health Programme (WSHP) tomorrow (August 19). The DH also commended 11 outstanding schools that have been upgraded to ""Advanced Schools"" under the WSHP.

  ""The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address"" announced that the WSHP would be strengthened and extended to cover all primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong. Based on the overall health status of students in each school, health reports will also be compiled for each participating school to recommend targeted school-based health promotion measures for physical activities, meals and other matters, to improve students' physical and psychological well-being.

During the 2024/25 school year, 808 schools participated in the WSHP, specifically 356 primary schools, 404 secondary schools, and 48 special schools. Of these, 339 were classified as ""Pledged Schools"", 458 as ""Action Schools"", and 11 as ""Advanced Schools"", covering nearly 70 per cent of schools in Hong Kong. The response was enthusiastic.

The Consultant Community Medicine (Family and Student Health) of the DH, Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, expressed gratitude to schools and parents for their support.

""The participating schools have strengthened the implementation of various measures under the Health Promoting School (HPS) framework, which include integrating four major health themes, namely physical activity, healthy eating, mental health and social well-being, into the school curriculum; providing facilities and venues to encourage students to engage in physical activities; providing high-quality physical education lessons; providing a healthy eating environment; setting up a task group to support students and staff members with emotional issues; recording and analysing students' health conditions; establishing a mechanism to assist students at risk of self-harm or suicide; and addressing bullying issues. The results are satisfactory,"" Dr Chuang said.

""The DH would like to take this opportunity to commend all the schools that have actively participated in and supported the WSHP, especially the 11 outstanding schools that have been upgraded from 'Pledged Schools' to 'Action Schools' and ultimately to 'Advanced Schools' (see Annex). These Advanced Schools have consistently implemented the HPS framework in a comprehensive manner, and have proactively implemented additional measures, such as setting up dedicated task forces to formulate and review healthy school policies, providing staff with training opportunities related to health, and inviting parents and community partners to provide suggestions on the development of a healthy school. They have also shared their experience and strategies for implementing the HPS with other schools through various channels,"" she added.

The WSHP is divided into three phases. First, the DH provides participating schools with guidelines and a checklist, referencing the Health Promoting School framework advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO), to help them systematically review and formulate health promotion measures. Next, the DH will conduct an in-depth analysis of the annual health assessment data of students attending Student Health Service Centres in the 2023/24 school year and the checklists submitted by the schools. Finally, based on these assessments, the DH will compile a health report and provide targeted health promotion recommendations tailored to each school's specific circumstances to assist schools in establishing priorities and strategies for their school-based health promotion work.

The health reports cover the above-mentioned four major health themes and six key factors of HPS, namely healthy school policies, schools' physical environment, schools' social environment, community links, action competencies for healthy living, and school health care and promotion services.

The DH will distribute the health reports to all participating schools tomorrow. Between mid-August and late September, the DH's professional healthcare teams will visit each participating school to provide in-depth explanations of the health reports, enabling the schools to implement relevant health promotion work in the new school year.

The DH will continue to actively promote the WSHP to all primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, and will collaborate with stakeholders to support schools to gradually upgrade from ""Pledged Schools"" to ""Action Schools"", and ultimately to ""Advanced Schools"" which have fully implemented the HPS framework. This will help realise the WHO's vision of ""making every school a health-promoting school"".

â""Evidence from international research shows that the implementation of the HPS framework can bring about a positive impact on the health of students, such as effectively reducing the risk of smoking among students, reducing bullying cases, helping to improve the body mass index of students, as well as increasing their physical activity and intake of fruits and vegetables. I would like to appeal to schools which have not yet joined the WSHP to visit the DH's designated webpage and sign the â""Whole School Health Charter"",or call 3163 4574 to contact the DH's Health Promoting School Division to register for the WSHP,"" Dr Chuang added.

Furthermore, the Student Health Service Centres of the DH provide annual health assessment services to all primary and secondary students in Hong Kong to identify students with health or behavioral problems at an early stage for timely advice and intervention. In addition to letting individual student know their own health condition, the DH will regularly analyse the data obtained to monitor the overall health condition and relevant trends of local students, and announce relevant findings to the public to raise their awareness on student health.

For more information on the list of participating schools and the WSHP, members of the public may visit the DH's designated webpage."
擴展「全校園健康計劃」首發「一校一健康報告」,2025-08-18 17:44,2025-08-18 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800710.htm,"衞生署今日（八月十八日）宣布，明日（八月十九日）將首次向每所參與「全校園健康計劃」（計劃）的學校發放「度身訂造」的《學校健康報告與建議》（《健康報告》），並表揚11所晉升成為最優秀的「卓越學校」。

《行政長官2024年施政報告》宣布強化及擴展計劃至全港中、小學，並為每所參與學校編製「一校一健康報告」，針對每所學校的整體學生健康狀況，建議促進健康的校本措施，以改善體能活動和飲食等安排，從而提升學生身心健康。

在二○二四／二五學年，全港共有808所學校（包括356所小學、404所中學和48所特殊學校）參與計劃，當中339所為「承諾學校」、458所為「行動學校」、11所為「卓越學校」，涵蓋近七成全港學校，反應踴躍。

衞生署社會醫學顧問醫生（家庭及學生健康）張竹君醫生感謝學校及家長的支持。

她說︰「參與計劃的學校加強落實多項《健康促進學校框架》的措施，包括將四大健康主題（即體能活動、健康飲食、精神健康和社交健康）融入學校課程、提供設施及場地鼓勵學生進行體能活動、提供高質素的體育課程、提供健康飲食環境、成立專責小組支援學生和員工的情緒問題、記錄和分析學生的健康狀況，以及建立機制協助有自毀或自殺風險的學生和處理學生的欺凌問題，表現令人滿意。」

「衞生署藉此表揚所有積極參與和支持計劃的學校，尤其是當中11所由『承諾學校』發展成為『行動學校』，繼而晉升成為表現優秀的『卓越學校』（見附件），它們持續全面落實《健康促進學校框架》，並進一步主動推行了其他措施，例如成立專責小組制定和檢討健康學校政策、提供機會讓員工參與相關健康主題的培訓，以及邀請家長和社區夥伴就健康校園發展提供建議等，並以不同渠道與其他學校分享實踐健康促進學校的經驗及策略。」

計劃分三個階段。首先，衞生署參考世界衞生組織（世衞）所倡議的《健康促進學校框架》，為參與學校提供指引和檢視表，協助學校有系統地檢視和制定健康促進措施。其後，衞生署會根據該校學生於二○二三／二四學年在學生健康服務中心進行的周年健康評估結果和學校遞交的檢視表進行深入分析。最後，綜合以上評估，衞生署針對每所學校的不同情況，逐一編製《健康報告》及提供針對性健康促進建議，供校方參考以訂立校本健康促進工作的發展優次和策略。

《健康報告》涵蓋上述四大健康主題及六大「健康促進學校」發展領域（即健康學校政策、學校環境、校風與人際關係、家校與社區聯繫、健康生活技能與實踐及學校保健與健康促進服務）。

衞生署明日向每所參與學校發放《健康報告》，並安排醫護團隊在本月中旬至下月底，到學校深入講解報告內容，以便校方在新學年落實相關的健康促進工作。

衞生署會繼續積極向全港中、小學推動計劃，並聯同持份者提供支援，促使學校循序漸進地由「承諾學校」發展成為「行動學校」，及最終晉升為已全面落實《健康促進學校框架》的「卓越學校」，以達至世衞「讓每一所學校都成為健康促進學校」的願景。

張竹君醫生補充說：「國際實證研究文獻顯示，學校實施《健康促進學校框架》能夠為學生健康帶來正面影響，例如有效降低學童的吸煙風險、減少欺凌個案、有助改善學生的體重指數，以及增加他們的體能活動和蔬果攝取量。我在此呼籲尚未參加計劃的學校，可瀏覽衞生署專題網頁及簽署《全校園健康約章》，或致電3163 4574聯絡衞生署健康促進學校科報名參與計劃。」

此外，衞生署學生健康服務中心為全港中小學生提供周年健康檢查服務，以及早識別有健康或行為問題的學生，適時提供建議和介入。除了每位學生可了解自身的健康狀況外，衞生署會定期分析取得的數據監測全港學生的整體健康狀況及相關趨勢，並向公眾發放有關資訊，以提高大眾對學生健康的關注。

市民如欲了解參與計劃的學校名單和更多相關資料，可瀏覽衞生署專題網頁。"

衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-08-18 17:00,2025-08-18 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800740.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（八月十八日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在八月十日至十六日期間，衞生防護中心錄得四宗社區感染的退伍軍人病個案，全部病人均有長期病患。詳情如下：


74歲男病人，居於東區；
80歲男病人，居於東區；
67歲男病人，居於北區；及
65歲男病人，居於南區。


衞生防護中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示四宗個案全部屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這些個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至八月十六日，今年錄得107宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-08-18 17:00,2025-08-18 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800742.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (August 18) reported the latest number of cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD), and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From August 10 to 16, the CHP recorded four community-acquired LD cases. All of the patients involved had underlying illnesses. The details of the cases are as follows:


A 74-year-old male patient living in Eastern District;
An 80-year-old male patient living in Eastern District;
A 67-year-old male patient living in North District; and
A 65-year-old male patient living in Southern District.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigation revealed that all four cases are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of August 16, 107 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.


Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


  The public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-08-18 16:30,2025-08-18 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800707.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on August 15 to noon today (August 18), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 221 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday). No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 150 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website
(www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 158 695 samples of food imported from Japan (including 104 002 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 36 048 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

​九龍灣彩石里「簡約公屋」八月二十五日起接受申請（附圖）,2025-08-18 16:30,2025-08-18 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800672.htm,"房屋局今日（八月十八日）宣布，九龍灣彩石里「簡約公屋」項目將於八月二十五日起接受申請。項目由校舍改建，提供約150個單位，預計二○二六年第一季起陸續入伙。

符合申請資格人士會在八月二十五日或之前陸續收到由房屋局寄出的申請表，於九月十五日或之前交回的申請將會獲優先處理及進行編配，包括彩石里及其他尚有單位的「簡約公屋」項目。曾經遞交申請表的人士，則無需再次提交申請。

房屋局發言人表示：「早前於今年二月開展的第二期『簡約公屋』申請，涵蓋啟德世運道（第一期）、屯門青福里（即屯門第3A區），觀塘順安道及上水彩園路四個項目，反應踴躍，申請者資格審核正陸續進行。除了該四個項目仍繼續接受申請外，有見工程進展順利，預計可於明年第一季入伙，今次決定加推九龍灣彩石里項目，希望提供多一個選擇予有迫切住屋需要的人士。」

發言人續說：「同時，位於元朗攸壆路約2 100個『簡約公屋』單位已在今年六月中全面入伙，而作為第二個落成及首個位於市區的牛頭角彩興路『簡約公屋』項目約2 290個單位亦預期快將完成入伙，充分反映租金便宜、配套服務齊全、居住環境更好的『簡約公屋』項目，相當受有需要的市民歡迎。房屋局剛公布二○二五年第二季公屋綜合輪候時間，一般申請者的綜合輪候時間下降0.2年至5.1年，是二○一八年第一季以來的最低位；而當中『簡約公屋』的一般申請者的輪候時間平均為2.3年，可見『簡約公屋』能快速回應急需改善居住環境家庭的需要。此外，約七成彩興路『簡約公屋』的住戶原先居住在不適切住房，例如『劏房』、天台屋和床位等，他們入住『簡約公屋』後生活即時得以大幅改善，因此我們呼籲有需要而又符合資格的市民盡快遞交申請。」

「根據差餉物業估價署所收集的『劏房』租金資料，二○二四年第三季的全港『劏房』租金中位數約5,500元，而『簡約公屋』的租金中位數約1,300元，我們預計每戶入住『簡約公屋』的居民平均每月可節省租金約4,200元，即30 000個單位的居民於五年間一共可節省超過75億元的租金支出。以相宜租金入住『簡約公屋』的基層市民將大大緩解租金壓力，把節省下來的租金用作其他更有意義的用途。」

Light Public Housing at Choi Shek Lane in Kowloon Bay to open for application from August 25 (with photo),2025-08-18 16:30,2025-08-18 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800678.htm,"ããThe Housing Bureau (HB) today (August 18) announced that the Light Public Housing (LPH) project at Choi Shek Lane, Kowloon Bay, will be open for application from August 25. The project is the renovation of a former school premises, and will provide about 150 units for gradual intake anticipated from the first quarter of 2026 onwards.

ããEligible applicants will receive the application forms by post on or before August 25 sent by the HB in batches. Application forms submitted before September 15 will be handled with priority for allocation, which will include Choi Shek Lane as well as other LPH projects that still have units available. Those who have submitted an application form previously do not need to submit another application.

ããA spokesman for the HB said, ""The Phase 2 LPH application, which was launched earlier in February this year, covers four projects, including Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak (Phase 1); Tsing Fuk Lane, Tuen Mun (i.e. Tuen Mun Area 3A); Shun On Road, Kwun Tong; and Choi Yuen Road, Sheung Shui. The response has been overwhelming, with eligibility verification for applicants being conducted progressively. In view of the satisfactory construction progress, apart from the said four projects still available for application, we decided to launch the Choi Shek Lane, Kowloon Bay, project, the intake of which is expected to commence in the first quarter of next year, in order to provide an extra option for those with an urgent housing need.""

  The spokesman added, ""Meanwhile, the tenant intake for the first LPH project at Yau Pok Road, Yuen Long, providing about 2,100 units, was fully completed in mid-June this year. The second LPH project at Choi Hing Road, Ngau Tau Kok, which provides about 2,290 units, is the first project in an urban area with a full intake expected to be completed soon. This fully demonstrates that with affordable rent, comprehensive facilities and services, as well as a better living environment, LPH projects are highly popular among residents in need. The HB just announced the Composite Waiting Time for Subsidised Rental Housing (CWT) for the second quarter of 2025. The CWT for general applicants has decreased by 0.2 years to 5.1 years, which is the lowest since the first quarter of 2018, among which, the waiting time for general applicants of LPH is 2.3 years on average, showing that LPH can quickly address the urgent demand for improving living conditions of households in need. Moreover, about 70 per cent of the residents at Choi Hing Road LPH previously resided in inadequate housing, such as sub-divided units (SDUs), rooftop houses and bedspaces, etc. Their livelihood has greatly improved right after moving into LPH. We urge eligible residents in need to submit their applications as soon as possible.

  ""Based on the data from the Rating and Valuation Department about the rent of SDUs, the median rent for SDUs across Hong Kong in the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $5,500, while the median rent for LPH is about $1,300. We estimate that each household can save about $4,200 on rent per month after moving into LPH. That represents a total of over $7.5 billion on rental savings for households of 30,000 units in five years. By moving into LPH with an affordable rent, not only can the grassroot residents face a much lower rental burden, they can also utilise the saved rent for other meaningful purposes.""

  Details of the LPH application process for Choi Shek Lane, Kowloon Bay, are as follows:

(1) Eligibility for priority application: general applicants who have been on the waiting list for traditional Public Rental Housing (PRH) for three years or more are eligible, with priority given to family applicants. Those meeting the eligibility criteria will receive by post the application forms sent by the HB in batches.

(2) Application period: applicants who submit duly completed application forms between August 25 and September 15 will be handled with priority for allocation, including Choi Shek Lane and other LPH projects which still have units available. From September 15 onwards, the HB will continue to accept applications.

(3) Submission methods: interested applicants may submit their duly completed application forms by post to PO Box of the Dedicated Team on Light Public Housing of the Housing Bureau (PO Box 28222, Gloucester Road Post Office, Wan Chai, Hong Kong); or by depositing them into drop-in boxes during office hours (from 9am to 6pm, Mondays to Fridays, except Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) at the following locations:

Light Public Housing Information Counter at Podium Level 2, Hong Kong Housing Authority Customer Service Centre, 3 Wang Tau Hom South Road, Kowloon; and
Office of the Dedicated Team on Light Public Housing at Room 801, 8/F, Revenue Tower, 5 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong.


ããIn addition, if the applicant and all family members have registered for ""iAM Smart+"", they may opt to complete, sign and submit the e-Form by scanning the exclusive QR code pre-printed on the application form.

ããThe HB will process the application forms received as soon as possible and make arrangements for the allocation. To give priority to those families in need to move into LPH, if the applicants are currently living in inadequate housing; having special medical conditions; or having minor-age children, newborns, elderly persons, etc, in the family, they will be given a higher priority for LPH allocation.

  The Choi Shek Lane, Kowloon Bay, project provides about 150 units (including units for one to two persons, three to four persons and four to five persons), and is about nine minutes to the Choi Hung MTR Station on foot, with a number of franchised bus and minibus routes in the vicinity travelling to/from various places in Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories. The estimated monthly rent ranges from about $1,230 to $3,310 (Note).

For more information about LPH applications, please refer to the enclosed LPH Promotional Pamphlet, or browse the LPH website of the HB (www.hb.gov.hk/eng/lph). For enquiries, please call 3464 0700, or send email to lphapp@hb.gov.hk.

Note: Rents may vary depending on the unit size and the district. The rental level is set at around 90 per cent of the rent of newly completed traditional PRH in the same district. Having regard to the biennial rent review of traditional PRH, the rent of LPH will be adjusted accordingly."

尊敬的梁珂副書記（深圳市前海合作區黨工委副書記）、尊敬的周和博士（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室社會工作部副部長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友、各位「共創明『Teen』」的學員：

非常高興在八月份來到前海，跟大家一起參與今天香港社福界心連心大行動（心連心）共創明天在前海國際交流中心的活動。心連心、「共創明『Teen』」和前海其實有共通之處，都是前沿創新的場地。「心連心」的平台和「共創明『Teen』」的整個大平台均是這屆政府提出的兩個創新之處。「共創明『Teen』」是在行政長官李家超指導下提出的項目，目的是為基層青少年，尤其是在初中時期的青少年，提供一個可以讓他們更好發揮潛力、創造自己明天的平台。

主要的目標是在香港這個基礎上開始，初期主要是在香港進行參觀，帶他們去增廣見聞，很快我們就有了認識祖國的活動，去了不少城市參觀。但我們這次來到前海特別有意義，因為前海標誌是國家對外開放最起眼的地方，有創新、獨特的地方。我期待通過今天的參觀訪問活動，同學們可以大開眼界，深深感受國家的發展和動力。心連心也是在國家和政府大力支持下成立，透過這個重要平台，讓我們社福界可以團結一致，更好地服務社會。

過去三年心連心取得巨大的成功，今天是心連心和「共創明『Teen』」連在一起的活動，意義更為重大，而且在前海成立十五周年之際，來到這裏參觀訪問，我覺得這是恰逢其時。我期待在往後的日子裏，有更多的活動可以讓香港和前海聯手打造一些新的合作項目，無論是由勞工及福利局主導，還是人才的項目，或是社福界的項目，如「共創明『Teen』」這些幫助基層青年的項目，我都期待香港和前海可以聯手推動發展。

當中我相信通過我們的創新精神，一定能掌握新的路線，利用好香港「一國兩制」的優勢和前海的最新發展，帶來無限的貢獻。我也榮幸能親身見證國家新的發展，也期待大家在開眼界之餘也要做好自己，打穩自己的基礎，善用特區政府和國家提供的平台，好好的鍛鍊自己，目標是長大以後為國家和香港作出貢獻。我在這裏預祝活動圓滿成功，也感謝前海管理局和中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室為我們提供的大力支持。"

The case involved unauthorised structures with a total area of about 27 square metres on the roof of a village house inSai Pin Wai, Yuen Long. Since the Lands Department would not issue a certificate of exemption for the unauthorised building works (UBWs) and the UBWs were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Due to failure to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (August 18), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without a reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

各位專家學者、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！很高興以視頻方式，參與今天的論壇，紀念中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年。

這次論壇由民建聯和招商局港口聯合主辦，邀請香港和內地的專家學者、抗戰老兵後人、社會各界代表一同銘記歷史、緬懷先烈、珍愛和平、開創未來。我首先祝賀論壇成功舉辦。

80年前，中國人民經歷14年的艱苦抗戰，中華兒女不屈不撓、眾志成城，終於迎來了偉大的勝利。這場勝利，是中華民族走向偉大復興的歷史轉折點，也是世界反法西斯戰爭的重要篇章，為人類和平事業作出重大貢獻。

香港市民與祖國同胞血脈相連，一直並肩作戰，從運送物資、營救受困人士，到投身抗戰前線、捍衞海上航道等，香港從未缺席。當時，很多港人投身港九大隊、東江縱隊等的游擊隊，並參與不同的抗日救亡團體。在香港的許多愛國志士，不惜犧牲性命，保護同胞、支援抗戰。他們的英勇不但展現堅毅不屈的錚錚鐵骨，更彰顯中華民族的愛國情懷。

抗戰勝利深刻啓示我們，和平來之不易，必須銘記戰爭的慘痛。當前，世界百年未有之大變局加速演進，地緣政治千變萬化、霸權主義影響全球，世界面臨的挑戰和威脅複雜多變。我們必須以史為鑑，銘記先烈為中華民族以至世界和平的付出，反對任何歪曲歷史、美化侵略的行為和言論。

中華兒女在抗戰展現出「天下興亡，匹夫有責」的民族大義。這種堅定信念是中華民族的寶貴財富，提醒我們在面對挑戰時要砥礪奮進。

特區政府積極傳承抗戰精神，增強市民的愛國情懷。特區政府將結合愛國主義教育、國家安全教育和中華文化教育，培育年輕一代正確認識歷史，厚植愛國情懷，成為建設香港、貢獻國家的棟樑之才。

香港將舉辦一系列活動紀念抗戰勝利80周年。今年初開始，特區政府成立的「愛國主義教育工作小組」全力統籌各個政策局及部門的紀念活動籌備工作。我們會舉辦不同專題展覽、教育活動、電影放映會，並動員各區青年和學生參與本地紀念活動和實地考察。我們也會結合抗戰勝利主題的學生和青年內地交流團，安排他們到訪國家的軍事設施、抗戰歷史遺址等，進一步培養香港青年對國家民族的認同感。

香港作為國際化城市，一直秉持開放包容、和平共處的精神。我們全力發揮香港內聯外通的優勢，與世界各國加強交往合作，為國家推動構建人類命運共同體、促進和平發展，貢獻香港力量。

各位，歷史是最好的教科書，也是未來的指南針。我們紀念抗戰勝利，不但是為了銘記歷史，更是為了啓迪今天、開創未來。就讓我們攜手並肩，為實現中華民族偉大復興，繼續不懈奮鬥！

最後，我祝願本次論壇圓滿成功，在座各位平安幸福。謝謝大家。"

僱主應與僱員訂立熱帶氣旋或暴雨後合理的工作安排,2025-08-18 06:36,2025-08-18 06:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800231.htm,"勞工處今日（八月十八日）提醒僱主應在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告信號取消後為僱員提供合理而切實可行的工作安排，並考慮路面、交通及其他情況，彈性處理僱員復工或遙距工作的安排（如適用）。這有助維持良好的勞資關係，並確保僱員安全及機構運作順暢。

勞工處發言人說：「在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告取消後，僱員如遇到實際困難而未能及時返回工作崗位，僱主應予以體諒並作出彈性處理，例如讓僱員分批復工、容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

Employers and employees should make reasonable work arrangements after tropical cyclones or rainstorms,2025-08-18 06:36,2025-08-18 06:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800232.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (August 18) reminded employers to make practical and reasonable work arrangements for employees after the cancellation of tropical cyclone warnings or rainstorm warnings, with due consideration to the road and traffic conditions and other factors, and make flexible arrangements for staff to resume work or work remotely (if applicable). This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

僱主僱員應訂立暴雨警告下的工作安排,2025-08-18 01:21,2025-08-18 01:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800061.htm,"勞工處今日（八月十八日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在暴雨警告下及極端情況及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以保障僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主應預先制定合理而可行的工作安排和應變措施。在擬訂及執行有關安排時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮當中的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在暴雨警告或極端情況下及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。」

如果紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外或空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如政府作出極端情況公布，除與僱主就此情況下已訂立返回工作地點上班協定的人員外，僱員應留在原來的地點或安全地點，不要啓程上班。已在工作地點當值的僱員，在安全情況下可如常工作；如工作地點有危險，在可行及安全的情況下，僱主應安排僱員提早下班或到安全的地方暫避。如工作時間在極端情況生效期間結束，僱主應在安全情況下安排僱員下班，或開放合適地方讓仍在工作地點的僱員暫避。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣及極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人亦提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

Employers and employees should make work arrangements in times of rainstorm warnings,2025-08-18 01:21,2025-08-18 01:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800062.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (August 18) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions as early as possible, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of organisations, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

  ""Employers should make prior work arrangements and contingency measures for staff which are reasonably practicable. In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

  To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or extreme conditions come to an end, when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather or extreme conditions.

  ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.

  If a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.

  If the Government makes an extreme conditions announcement, apart from those required by employers to report for duty at workplaces, employees are advised to stay in the place they are currently in or in safe places when extreme conditions are in force, instead of heading for work. Employees who have already reported for duty at workplaces could continue to work as usual in a safe manner. If the workplaces are in danger, employers should release staff from work early under feasible conditions and in a safe manner or make available a safe place as temporary shelter for employees. If the working time ends while extreme conditions are still in force, employers can release employees from workplaces in a safe manner or provide a suitable area as temporary shelter for those still at workplaces.

  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.

  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.
 
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

勞工處發言人今日（八月十八日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

  A spokesman for the LD said today (August 18) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

FSTB announced three-pronged approach to follow up incident regarding Government procurement of bottled drinking water (with photo),2025-08-17 21:40,2025-08-17 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/17/P2025081700777.htm,"Regarding the recent incident concerning Government procurement of bottled drinking water, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (SFST), Mr Christopher Hui, convened an urgent meeting with relevant parties today (August 17) and decided at the meeting that a three-pronged approach would be taken to investigate into the incident and conduct a review on the system with a view to avoiding re-occurrence of similar incidents.

Mr Hui said, ""The incident has brought up concerns among government colleagues and drawn extensive attention from the public. I have therefore invited the Audit Commission to conduct a review on the tender exercise in question. I will establish a task force, with me as the Chair, to work with other government bureaux and departments to comprehensively review the existing Government procurement regime. I have also instructed the Government Logistics Department (GLD) to step up its remedial action for the incident.""

The follow-up actions that the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) will take are:

(1) The FSTB has proactively invited the Audit Commission to review the tender exercise for the subject bottled drinking water contract to find out if there are any negligence or deficiencies in the process;

(2) A task force chaired by the SFST will be established with representatives from the Civil Service Bureau, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Development Bureau and the Department of Justice to review the existing Government procurement regime with a view to plugging possible loopholes and avoiding re-occurrence of similar incidents. The FSTB anticipated that report on the preliminary recommendations will be available after three months; and

(3) The GLD has been tasked to take up the main responsibility to continuously monitor the contractual performance of the suppliers of bottled drinking water, step up its remedial action regarding the contract of bottled drinking water in question, as well as follow up with relevant government departments on other government contracts undertaken by the same contractor and its persons-in-charge to take an overall look on their performances.

At the same time, the GLD has informed all bureaux and departments to recall the bottled drinking water in question and made relevant arrangements."
