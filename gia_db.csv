Reporter: Now that the Bill was voted down, what would be the Government's next step and whether the Government would seek extension of time from the Court? Would there be any adverse impact to the rule of law of Hong Kong?

Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs: As I just said, the Government is not going to apply for any extension of time from the Court for the moment but we will further discuss with the DoJ (Department of Justice) to see how to take forward the matter.

As regards the rule of law of Hong Kong, the Government has all along fully respected the rule of law of Hong Kong as well as the Court's ruling. And that's why we introduced the Bill this time to discharge our positive obligations under the Hong Kong BoR (Bill of Rights) as ruled by the court. And throughout the whole legislative process, you can see that from our detailed analysis of the judgement to see how to fulfil the requirements as set out by the court, to the drafting of the Bill, the introduction of the Bill, and also all the explanatory and lobbying work that we have done to solicit support from the Legislative Council as well as the public. You can see that we have tried our best to pursue the legislative process as well as to fulfil our obligations. As regards of the Legislative Council, you can see that they have dutifully and effectively discharged their functions and obligations under the Basic Law to closely scrutinise the Bill, and to render advice to the Government, and also to reflect the views of the public to us.

立法會十八題：預防蚊傳疾病,2025-09-10 19:06,2025-09-10 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000674.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上梁文廣議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

衞生署衞生防護中心指出，隨着夏季氣溫及雨量上升，蚊傳疾病（包括基孔肯雅熱及登革熱）的傳播風險增加。據報香港鄰近地區已出現基孔肯亞熱的疫情，而登革熱在過往夏季亦曾出現本地爆發。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年本港每年錄得的基孔肯雅熱及登革熱個案數目分別為何，以及當中分別有多少宗屬本地及輸入個案；

（二）過去三個月，在各口岸的健康篩檢工作中發現多少宗發燒個案，以及當中有多少宗最終確診為蚊傳疾病；

（三）衞生署如何在各口岸（包括各陸路口岸及機場）加強對來自蚊傳疾病高風險地區旅客的健康篩檢工作，例如會否考慮為出現相關病徵的旅客和相關航班乘客進行快速檢測，以縮短確診蚊傳疾病時間；

（四）食物環境衞生署及相關政府部門如何加強本港蚊患嚴重地區的滅蚊工作，以及今年至今的滅蚊工作詳情為何；及

（五）政府會否考慮引入新技術以提升滅蚊效率？

答覆：

主席：

衞生署衞生防護中心一直密切監察世界各地蚊傳疾病（包括問題提及的登革熱和基孔肯雅熱）的情況。

就登革熱，世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，全球發病率在過去二十年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。登革熱患者可能會出現高燒、嚴重頭痛、眼窩後疼痛、肌肉及關節痛、噁心、嘔吐、淋巴結腫脹及出疹。有些人在感染後沒有明顯病徵，有些則只有發熱及出疹等輕微及不明確病徵。第一次感染的病情一般較輕，病癒後對該血清型病毒會產生終生免疫能力，但對其他三種血清型病毒只有部分和短暫的交叉免疫能力。若隨後感染其他血清型的登革熱病毒，出現重症登革熱的機會則較高，可導致死亡。在二○二三年，全球80多個國家／地區曾經錄得本地傳播個案，共呈報了逾650萬宗病例（包括7 300多宗死亡個案），而二○二四年更錄得超過1 400萬宗病例，創歷史新高。

就基孔肯雅熱而言，世衞資料顯示全球超過110個國家／地區曾經錄得本地傳播個案。患者可能會出現發燒和嚴重關節痛。由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，並多數與其他已存在的健康問題有關。大部分患者可以完全痊癒。今年一月至七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗病例，當中約90宗為死亡個案。亞洲方面，二○二五年印度及印度尼西亞分別錄得超過32 000宗及17 000宗病例，其他錄得病例的地區包括內地、孟加拉國及斯里蘭卡等。廣東省（尤其佛山市）自七月起錄得超過10 000宗基孔肯雅熱病例，病情一般輕微而當中沒有死亡個案，情況在八月下旬已受到控制，每日只有零星新增個案。自七月開始本港亦錄得從世界各地有病例地區的零星輸入個案，顯示爆發風險依然存在，市民不應掉以輕心。

另外，日本腦炎也是一種經蚊子傳播的疾病，而香港亦曾錄得輸入個案。日本腦炎主要流行於亞洲及西太平洋地區的郊外及農村，尤其在氣候炎熱的季節。大部分病人均病情輕微，除發燒及頭痛外，一般不會有其他顯著病徵，但每250宗感染中便大約有一宗會出現嚴重病情，病徵包括迅速出現高燒、頭痛、頸部僵硬、喪失方向知覺、昏迷、抽搐、痙攣性癱瘓，甚至死亡。

白紋伊蚊是登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的傳播媒介，而日本腦炎的主要病媒蚊是庫蚊。針對蚊傳疾病的防控，防蚊滅蚊工作至為重要。在環境及生態局主持的跨部門防治蟲鼠督導委員會下，相關政府政策局及部門已實施多項預防及控制蚊傳疾病的措施。

就梁文廣議員的提問，經諮詢環境及生態局和衞生署後，本局現回覆如下：

（一）登革熱方面，本港於過去五年（二○二○至二○二四年）每年錄得2至161宗個案，大部分為輸入個案。截至二○二五年九月四日，本港今年累計錄得44宗登革熱個案，全部為輸入個案，來自印度、印度尼西亞、菲律賓、泰國、馬來西亞、柬埔寨、斐濟、斯里蘭卡、孟加拉國及新加坡。詳細數字載於下表。

基孔肯雅熱方面，本港於過去五年（二○二○至二○二四年）未有錄得任何個案。截至二○二五年九月四日，本港今年累計錄得13宗基孔肯雅熱個案，全部屬輸入個案，七宗來自中國內地（廣東省佛山市）、四宗來自孟加拉國、一宗來自印度尼西亞及一宗來自斯里蘭卡。

日本腦炎方面，本港過去五年（二○二○至二○二四年）沒有錄得個案。截至二○二五年九月四日，本港今年錄得一宗輸入個案，來自菲律賓。

（二）於二○二五年六月至八月期間，衞生署於口岸健康篩查中，發現991宗入境旅客發燒個案，當中沒有確診蚊傳疾病的個案。

（三）衞生署在所有跨境口岸（即香港國際機場及連接廣東省的各個陸路及水路口岸）執行對入境人士的健康篩檢措施，包括進行體溫檢測及按機制為發燒個案或有病徵的旅客（例如自行申報不適的旅客）作進一步健康評估，並透過填寫健康評估表，了解其病徵、旅遊史及接觸史等，以便作出適切轉介及跟進。

自廣東省衞生當局於今年七月中報告基孔肯雅熱疫情，衞生署港口衞生科跟深圳海關保持緊密聯繫，並深化雙方通報機制，確保兩地口岸的防控措施能順利執行。若有發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客經港口衞生科人員評估後被懷疑患有基孔肯雅熱，會立即被安排轉送至香港公立醫院作跟進處理。至今未在口岸發現懷疑基孔肯雅熱個案。

衞生署港口衞生科會繼續與相關持份者（如航空公司及旅遊業界等）保持緊密聯繫，適時更新疾病資訊和健康建議；港口衞生科人員亦會嚴格監控各口岸的環境衞生，加強巡查，全面落實口岸防蚊及控蚊措施，確保良好環境衞生及病媒控制工作到位。

蚊傳疾病（包括登革熱、基孔肯雅熱和日本腦炎）的潛伏期較長，甚至可達約兩星期，單靠入境時的港口衞生措施偵測感染個案的效用並不顯著。與此同時，登革熱和基孔肯雅熱感染者血液內的病毒含量一般而言在發病後首數日最高，因此在病發初期的準確診斷需要通過對患者血液進行病毒核酸測試。登革熱和基孔肯雅熱核酸檢測產品亦需在實驗室由專業人員使用，目前市面上並沒有獲國際衞生當局認證可供實驗室以外自行使用的相關快速核酸測試產品。至於市面上的基孔肯雅熱快速檢測，是針對患者體內的抗體作測試。由於身體感染基孔肯雅熱後一般需要大約一星期才會對基孔肯雅病毒產生抗體，因此相關快速檢測不適合用於病發初期，會出現假陰性情況，亦不能縮短確診時間。

（四）各政府部門一直積極採取防蚊滅蚊措施。環境及生態局分別在今年三月和七月召開跨部門防治蟲鼠督導委員會會議，檢視蚊患最新情況和各部門的防治蚊患工作。在跨部門協調機制下，食物環境衞生署（食環署）和各相關部門已進行一系列防治蚊患工作，並因應鄰近地區出現基孔肯亞熱個案的情況採取多項加強措施，詳情如下︰

病媒監測

食環署持續在全港不同地點放置誘蚊器，以監察可傳播登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生情況，並通過部門網頁及政府地理空間信息樞紐平台，定期公布各分區誘蚊器指數，讓各部門和持份者可因應監察結果採取針對性滅蚊措施。為進一步加強防控，食環署自今年八月起將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時啓動的強化控蚊工作，擴展至指數介乎10%至20%的區域。食環署會在有關區域進行詳細風險評估，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，聯同各部門及持份者進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作，亦會通知附近屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

減少蚊子滋生地點及滅蚊

食環署防治蚊患的工作以環境防治為核心，着重減少蚊子滋生地點，並運用生物或化學方法，包括施放殺幼蟲劑和進行霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，從而控制蚊子數量。今年一月至八月期間，食環署各分區共進行逾22 000次霧化處理殺滅成蚊行動。

另外，食環署亦加強巡查建築地盤及工地等高危地點。今年一月至八月期間，食環署共提出103宗檢控，包括95宗涉及建築地盤，8宗涉及其他處所。自今年八月，食環署已向建築地盤及工地發出逾200張法定通知，指示其清理積水。

跨部門及跨界別協作

食環署在全港各分區均召開「跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組」特別會議，協調相關部門和持份者聯手採取針對性及持久性的防蚊滅蚊措施，包括積極在轄下處所和場地採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

食環署並已發信予物業管理及防治蟲鼠業界，呼籲向其負責管理屋苑的業戶或工作單位宣傳和落實滅蚊措施。此外，食環署已與物業管理業監管局和衞生防護中心合作舉辦大型講座，向約3 000名物管業界人員介紹基孔肯雅熱防控資訊。

食環署亦聯同發展局，透過建造業議會向200多個地盤及相關人員發出《給建築地盤的防蚊指引》，提醒從業員做好防治蚊患工作及個人防護；及在新學年開始前，透過教育局向全港逾2 000所學校（包括幼稚園、中小學）發出《給學校的防蚊指引》，協助校方防範蚊傳疾病傳播的風險。

（五）食環署會持續應用科技以加強滅蚊成效，例如引入2 000多個新型捕蚊器，即利用成蚊作為載體，把生長調節劑帶到不同水體，使水體中的孑孓不能發育為成蚊，以抑制成蚊的密度。此外，食環署正聯同機電工程署實地試驗利用機械狗在叢林等較難進入的地方進行霧化工作，提升控蚊效果。

食環署會密切留意世衞和各地在滅蚊方面的最新資訊，並研究各種新技術及產品在本港應用的可行性。如有合適的新技術及產品，食環署會積極考慮引入及應用。"
LCQ18: Prevention of mosquito-borne diseases,2025-09-10 19:06,2025-09-10 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000677.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Leung Man-kwong and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health (DH) has pointed out that, with the increase in temperature and rainfall in summer, the risk of transmission of mosquito-borne diseases (including chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF)) increases. It has been reported that outbreaks of CF have occurred in neighbouring areas of Hong Kong, and local outbreaks of DF were seen in past summers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of CF and DF cases recorded in Hong Kong in each of the past five years, and among them, the respective numbers of local and imported cases;

(2) of the number of fever cases detected in the health screening work at various boundary control points (BCPs) in the past three months, and among them, the number of cases eventually confirmed to be mosquito-borne diseases;

(3) how DH will strengthen the health screening work for travellers from areas with high risk of mosquito-borne diseases at various BCPs (including all land BCPs and the airport), for example, whether it will consider conducting rapid tests on travellers showing relevant symptoms and passengers on relevant flights, so as to shorten the time required for confirming mosquito-borne diseases;

(4) how the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and relevant government departments will step up mosquito control efforts in areas with serious mosquito infestation in Hong Kong, and of the details of such mosquito control work so far this year; and

(5) whether the Government will consider introducing new technologies to enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control work?

Reply:

President,

  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) has all along been closely monitoring the global situation of mosquito-borne diseases (including dengue fever (DF) and chikungunya fever (CF) mentioned in the question).

  Regarding DF, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. DF patients may have high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, swollen lymph nodes and rash. Some infected people may not develop apparent symptoms, while some may only have mild and non-specific symptoms such as fever and rash. The symptoms of first infection are usually mild. Once recovered, lifelong immunity to that serotype of dengue virus will develop. However, cross-immunity to the other three serotypes after recovery is only partial and temporary. Subsequent infections with other serotypes of dengue virus are more likely to result in severe dengue or even progress to death. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases (including more than 7 300 deaths) were reported in over 80 countries/regions. In 2024, over 14 million cases were recorded, which was a record high.

  Regarding CF, according to the WHO, CF cases with local transmission have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Patient may suffer from fever and debilitating joint pain. Severe symptoms and deaths from CF are rare and usually related to other coexisting health problems. Most patients recover fully. From January to July this year, more than 240 000 cases were recorded in 16 countries/regions worldwide, including about 90 deaths. In Asia, India and Indonesia recorded more than 32 000 and 17 000 cases respectively in 2025. Other regions that have recorded CF cases include the Mainland, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, etc. Guangdong Province (especially Foshan City) has recorded more than 10 000 CF cases since July. The illness was generally mild with no deaths reported. The situation was under control since late August, with only sporadic new cases reported each day. Since July, Hong Kong has also recorded sporadic imported cases from different places around the world where there are confirmed cases, indicating that the risk of an outbreak still exists and the public should stay vigilant.

  In addition, Japanese encephalitis (JE) is also a mosquito-borne disease and imported cases have also been recorded in Hong Kong. JE occurs mainly in the rural and agricultural areas of Asia and the Western Pacific Region, especially during hot seasons. Most infections occur without apparent symptoms or with mild symptoms such as fever and headache. However, approximately one in every 250 infections is associated with severe illness characterised by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and even death.

  Aedes albopictus is the vector for both DF and CF; and the Culex species is the principal vector for JE. For the prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases, mosquito prevention and control work is of paramount importance. Under the interdepartmental Pest Control Steering Committee (PCSC) convened by the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB), relevant government bureaux and departments have implemented various prevention and control measures against mosquito-borne diseases.

  In response to the Hon Leung Man-kwong's enquiry, our reply in consultation with the EEB and the DH is as follows:

(1) On DF, Hong Kong recorded two to 161 DF cases annually in the past five years (2020 to 2024), with the majority being imported cases. As of September 4, 2025, Hong Kong has recorded 44 DF cases this year, all being imported cases from India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Fiji, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Singapore. Detailed figures are in the following table.

  On CF, no local case has been recorded in Hong Kong in the past five years (2020 to 2024). As of September 4, 2025, Hong Kong has recorded 13 CF cases this year, all being imported cases, with seven cases from the Mainland China (Foshan City of Guangdong Province), four cases from Bangladesh, one case from Indonesia and one case from Sri Lanka.

  On JE, Hong Kong has not recorded any cases in the past five years (2020 to 2024). As of September 4, 2025, Hong Kong has recorded one imported case from the Philippines in 2025.

(2) From June to August 2025, the DH detected 991 fever cases among inbound travellers during health screenings at the boundary control points (BCPs). None of these cases was confirmed to have mosquito-borne diseases.

(3) The DH implements health screening measures for inbound travellers at all cross-border ports (including the Hong Kong International Airport and land and sea ports connecting to the Guangdong Province). These measures involve temperature checks and, when necessary, further health assessments for individuals with fever or those reporting symptoms (e.g. those self-reporting discomfort) according to the established mechanism. A health assessment form is used to gather information on symptoms, travel history and contact history, which enables appropriate referrals and follow-up actions.

  Since reporting of a CF outbreak by the heath authorities of the Guangdong Province in mid-July this year, the Port Health Division (PHD) of the DH has maintained close liaison with Shenzhen Customs and enhanced mutual notification mechanisms to ensure smooth implementation of port control measures. If travellers with fever or related symptoms are suspected of having CF after assessment by PHD staff, they will be immediately referred to public hospitals in Hong Kong for follow-up. No suspected CF cases have been found at the BCPs so far.

  The PHD of the DH continues to maintain close communication with relevant stakeholders (e.g. airlines and tourism industry) to update disease information and health advice promptly. PHD staff will also closely monitor environmental hygiene at all BCPs, strengthen inspections, fully implement mosquito prevention and control work at BCPs, and ensure good environmental hygiene and vector control measures are in place.

  Mosquito-borne diseases (including DF, CF and JE) have a long incubation period, potentially up to about two weeks. Port health measures alone are therefore insufficient to detect infected cases at the place of entry. At the same time, for DF and CF, the viral load in an infected person's blood is the highest in the first few days after symptom onset. Therefore, the diagnosis during the early stage of the diseases is accurate only through viral nucleic acid testing of the patient's blood. DF and CF nucleic acid testing products must be used by professional personnel in laboratory settings. Currently, there are no rapid nucleic acid test products on the market that have been certified by international health authorities for self-testing outside laboratory settings. As for the existing rapid test kits for CF on the market, they target antibodies in patient's body. Since the body typically takes about a week to produce antibodies against the chikungunya virus, such rapid tests are not suitable for use in the early stage of the diseases and may result in false negatives, thereby unable to shorten the time for diagnosis.

(4) All departments concerned have been actively implementing anti-mosquito measures. The EEB held interdepartmental PCSC meetings in March and July this year respectively to review the latest situation of the mosquito problem and the mosquito prevention and control work carried out by various departments. Under the inter-departmental coordination mechanism, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have carried out a series of mosquito prevention and control work, as well as strengthened the related measures in response to CF cases reported in neighbouring regions. The details of the enhanced measures are as follows:

Vector surveillance

  The FEHD continues to place gravidtraps in different areas across Hong Kong for monitoring the infestation of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit DF and CF. The FEHD publishes the Area Gravidtrap Indices (AGI) on its departmental webpage and the Government's Geospatial Information Hub platform on a regular basis, so that government departments and stakeholders can adopt targeted mosquito control measures with respect to the surveillance results. To further step up mosquito prevention and control, since August this year, the FEHD has extended its strengthened mosquito control work, which was originally initiated when the AGI of an area has reached 20 per cent, to also cover areas with AGI between 10 per cent and 20 per cent. The FEHD will conduct detailed risk assessment for the areas concerned to identify locations with more severe mosquito infestation, so as to carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control work jointly with other departments and stakeholders. The FEHD will also notify the nearby housing estates, advising their property management companies and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking anti-mosquito measures.

Minimising mosquito breeding grounds and eliminating mosquitoes

  With the primary focus on environmental control, the FEHD's mosquito prevention and control work focuses on minimising mosquito breeding grounds. Biological or chemical methods, including applying larvicides and conducting fogging operations, are carried out to eliminate adult mosquitoes so as to control their population. From January to August 2025, the FEHD conducted over 22 000 fogging operations across the territory to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

  In addition, the FEHD has stepped up inspections of high-risk locations such as construction sites and works sites. From January to August 2025, the FEHD instituted a total of 103 prosecutions, including 95 cases involving construction sites and eight cases involving other premises. Since August 2025, the FEHD has issued over 200 statutory notices to construction sites and works sites, instructing them to clear stagnant water.

Inter-departmental and cross-sectoral collaboration

  The FEHD has convened special meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to coordinate with relevant departments and stakeholders in implementing targeted and sustained mosquito prevention and control measures, including actively implementing anti-mosquito measures in their respective premises and venues.

  The FEHD issued letters to the property management sector and the pest control sector, calling on them to promote and implement anti-mosquito measures among the residents or work units of the housing estates under their management. Moreover, the FEHD, the Property Management Services Authority and the CHP jointly held a large-scale seminar providing information on the prevention and control measures against CF for about 3 000 practitioners of the property management sector.

  The FEHD has also collaborated with the Development Bureau to issue the ""Guidelines on Mosquito Prevention in Construction Sites"" to over 200 construction sites and relevant personnel through the Construction Industry Council, reminding the practitioners to take appropriate anti-mosquito and personal protective measures. In addition, prior to the start of the new school year, the FEHD issued the ""Guidelines on Mosquito Prevention in Schools"" through the Education Bureau to over 2 000 schools across the territory, including kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools, so as to facilitate preventing the risk of mosquito-borne disease transmission in schools.

(5) The FEHD has been applying technologies to enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control. For example, the FEHD has adopted over 2 000 new mosquito trapping devices, using adult mosquitoes as carriers to carry growth regulators to different water bodies so that larvae in the water bodies cannot develop into adult mosquitoes, to suppress the density of adult mosquitoes. Moreover, the FEHD is working with the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department to conduct on-site trials on robot dogs carrying out fogging operations at inaccessible places such as shrubby areas to enhance the anti-mosquito effectiveness.

  The FEHD will closely monitor the latest information from the WHO and other places concerning mosquito control measures. The FEHD will also study the feasibility of introducing the new technologies and products to Hong Kong. Should any suitable new technologies and products be identified, the FEHD will actively consider their introduction and application."
香港視覺藝術中心展出藝術家阮家儀大型光影裝置作品（附圖）,2025-09-10 19:05,2025-09-10 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025090900665.htm,"藝術推廣辦事處轄下的香港視覺藝術中心今日（九月十日）起推出新展覽「幻影」，展出香港藝術家阮家儀創作的兩組全新大型場域特定藝術裝置作品。

阮家儀對香港城市文化有著獨特的情感連結及觀察。她喜愛利用收集充滿懷舊韻味的舊物創作藝術裝置，並借助燈光投影技術，喚起觀眾的集體回憶，以及對城市變遷的關注和反思。

兩組作品於香港視覺藝術中心三樓至五樓公共空間展出。《幻影》靈感源自一九九○年代在商場公共區域流行的音樂噴泉。阮家儀巧妙地融合動態光影與承載集體記憶的現成物，例如快餐店兒童餐的玩具、室內遊樂場的揼蟹機等，創作出有趣的立體雕塑。在光影的律動變化中，喚起人們對昔日商場公共空間的記憶，並引發觀眾對消費文化與童年記憶的深刻思考。

另一組作品《城市穿搭指南》則延續阮家儀的標誌性創作風格，在輸送帶上排列了各地名勝的紀念擺設，在光影投射下拼湊出一個世界地圖的縮影。

展覽由康樂及文化事務署主辦、香港視覺藝術中心籌劃。展覽於九月十日至明年二月九日在中區堅尼地道7A香港視覺藝術中心舉行，免費入場。有關展覽詳情，可瀏覽網頁www.apo.hk/tc/web/apo/va_mirage.html，或致電2521 3008查詢。"
Hong Kong Visual Arts Centre showcases large-scale lighting installations by artist Angela Yuen (with photos),2025-09-10 19:05,2025-09-10 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025090900666.htm,"  The Hong Kong Visual Arts Centre of the Art Promotion Office is staging the new exhibition ""Mirage"" from today (September 10), featuring two sets of new large-scale site-specific art installation works created by Hong Kong artist Angela Yuen.

Yuen has a unique emotional connection and artistic perspective on Hong Kong's urban culture. She utilises collected nostalgic found objects to create artworks. With the support of light projection techniques, her works evoke collective memories in the audience and prompt viewers to reflect on the evolving pace of urban society.

The two sets of installation works are on display in the public areas from the third to the fifth floor of the centre. The work ""Mirage"" is inspired by the musical fountains that were popular in mall public spaces during the 1990s. Yuen skilfully integrates dynamic light and shadow with ready-made objects that embody shared recollections, such as toys from children's meals from fast food restaurants and the crab-claw machines from indoor playgrounds, to create captivating sculptures. Through the rhythmic interplay of light and movement, the work prompts viewers to evoke memories of malls as public spaces and invites deeper reflection on consumer culture and childhood memories.

  Another artwork, ""City Styling Manual"", on display continues Yuen's signature creative approach.Souvenirs depicting iconic landmarks from around the world are arranged on a conveyor belt, interplaying with light and shadow to create a miniature world map.

The exhibition is presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and is organised by the Hong Kong Visual Arts Centre. The exhibition will run from September 10 to February 9 next year at the centre (7A Kennedy Road, Central). Admission is free. For details of the exhibition, please visit the website at www.apo.hk/en/web/apo/va_mirage.html or call 2521 3008."
立法會：政制及內地事務局局長動議恢復二讀辯論《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》發言全文（只有中文）,2025-09-10 18:54,2025-09-10 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000736.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上動議恢復二讀辯論《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》（《條例草案》）的發言全文：

代主席：

首先，我衷心感謝《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》法案委員會主席陳勇議員，以及各位委員、秘書處以及法律顧問所作的努力，令《條例草案》的審議工作得以順利高效完成。

我亦感謝立法會以及不同團體和社會人士透過不同渠道就《條例草案》向我們表達各種寶貴意見。特區政府對這些意見十分重視，並會在我們制訂相關安排時予以適當考慮。

正如政府一再強調，今次推出《條例草案》的目的，是履行終審法院在岑子杰對律政司司長案中宣告政府根據《香港人權法案》第十四條須履行的積極義務，即透過立法機制替代框架，讓同性伴侶關係獲得法律承認，並制訂伴隨的適當權利和責任。

而在整個推動立法的過程中，政府一直秉持着尊重法治、尊重終審法院裁決的精神，致力認真研究判詞的內容以及如何達致法院的裁決要求，並充分考慮香港的實際情況、傳統價值觀以及社會和諧穩定因素，從而作出適當平衡，形成社會「最大公約數」，以確保在適當維護同性伴侶人士權益的同時，亦符合香港的整體利益。而在推進有關法案時，政府亦不遺餘力地向立法會及公眾作出清晰詳細解說和游說，盡最大努力希望法案獲得立法會支持通過。這是政府對法院裁決的負責任行為，亦是積極維護社會整體利益和和諧穩定的務實做法。

而在立法會方面，我們亦樂見從法案推出以來，議員們都盡責履職地認真就法案進行審議並提出不同意見。作為社會民意代表的代議士，當遇上這類富爭議性而社會上又確實存在不同聲音和意見的議題，議員們有不同看法和意見實屬正常。關鍵是大家都能夠明白到這是終審法院的最終裁決而又為社會所高度關注，因此都格外審慎進行審議和提出意見，同時亦不斷收集聽取市民的各種不同意見，實事求是地在議會上作出反映。這本身亦是對法治以至法院裁決的尊重表現，亦充分反映在現行特區政治架構中，行政、立法、司法機關各司其職、相互尊重，有效發揮着各自的職能和責任，共同維護促進特區的穩定和諧發展。

在法案審議過程中，議員都提出不少務實的意見和建議，當中包括有議員擔心法案一旦獲得通過，會對傳統婚姻制度造成嚴重衝擊。政府亦一再鄭重強調，必定會堅決維護本港「一夫一妻、一男一女」的傳統婚姻制度。在岑子杰案中，終審法院的判詞亦明確確認，香港居民根據《基本法》及《香港人權法案》所保證和保障的婚姻憲法自由只限於異性婚姻，並把同性婚姻排除在外。這是香港社會傳承已久的核心家庭價值觀念，亦是構成社會穩定的重要基石，政府對此立場堅定，而建議的同性伴侶登記制度絕對不等同承認有關關係在香港擁有與婚姻相同的法律地位。

另外，亦有意見認為政府要求同性伴侶須在外地註冊後才可在本港進行登記，會為有關人士帶來不便和不公。這點我們在法案委員會會議上已作出多次詳細解說。制訂這項要求的主要原因，是政府在登記時須確認有關關係為已作出承諾及穩定的關係，而建議的做法可提供客觀的準則和清晰的驗證，在行政執行上較為可行；而對登記人而言，亦可減少在核實過程中可能帶來的不便。因此，我們認為有關做法是合適的，亦不會對登記人造成太大困難。

此外，亦有意見認為，政府給予同性伴侶的權利不足，甚至有違終審法院的裁決。我們亦多次強調，法院的要求是我們須履行積極義務，讓同性伴侶受到法律保障，免其私生活受到侵擾。而我們目前的方案，一方面設立法律承認機制，讓同性伴侶在透露其同性關係時免卻其私人生活受到干擾，同時亦給予核心權利，讓同性伴侶可滿足「基本的社會需求」。這已經是符合法庭的要求，至於具體權利的制訂，法院已明確表明行政及立法機關是有彈性的酌情空間，而我們按照香港的實際情況和整體利益作出考量和制訂，是絕對合理和合法的。

至於在《條例草案》審議過程中議員和各界所提出的其他意見，我們在法案委員會上已作出詳細回應，在此就不再費時重複了。

主席，政府深切明白同性伴侶獲法律承認和保障在社會上是具敏感和爭議性的議題。但在終審法院已作出最終裁決的前提下，政府亦遇事不避難，堅決承擔責任，履行法院判定的積極義務。惟在制訂方案和草擬法案過程中，我們亦充分考量了香港的實際情況和各相關因素，並致力取得平衡，一方面保障同性伴侶的合法權益，同時致力維持香港社會和諧穩定，並尊重傳統價值觀念。現法案已獲法案委員會審議，而各位議員亦在剛才的二讀辯論中發表了不同的意見，我懇請各位議員支持通過二讀《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》，以及我稍後動議的修正案。

我謹此陳辭。多謝代主席。"

Under the agreement, Beijing and the HKSAR will consolidate and strengthen exchanges and co-operation in communicable disease prevention and control, with a focus on collaborative response to major respiratory infectious diseases.

  ""The DH of the HKSAR has maintained close ties with the BJHC, and signed agreements with a validity period of five years in 2015 and 2020 respectively. Through reciprocal visits, academic activities, information sharing, personnel training and exhibitions, both sides have engaged in in-depth exchanges on disease prevention and control and public health emergencies response during public health incidents. We have achieved fruitful results through sustained, comprehensive, and extensive sharing of valuable experiences in traditional Chinese medicines, health legislation, regulation and law enforcement,"" Dr Lam said.

  ""The renewal of the agreement today signifies a new starting point and a new chapter in our collaboration, fostering deeper synergy in the Beijing-Hong Kong public health efforts. The agreement with the Beijing Municipal Disease Prevention and Control Administration will help build a more efficient and high-quality major communicable disease prevention and control system, enhancing mutual learning and public health security standards. The two agreements will solidify and strengthen the linkage and collaboration between the health authorities of Beijing and the HKSAR, enabling us to jointly address global public health challenges and better safeguard public health,"" he added.

The DH delegation will continue their visit to Beijing tomorrow (September 11), calling on the public health-related authorities to strengthen co-operation and exchanges in the medical and health sectors."

​運輸及物流局局長出席香港商用航空中心新客運大樓啟用禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-09-10 18:52,2025-09-10 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000750.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（九月十日）出席香港商用航空中心新客運大樓啟用禮的致辭全文：

Raymond（新鴻基地產主席兼董事總經理郭炳聯）、Fred（香港機場管理局主席林天福）、Henry（全國政協常委及西九文化區管理局董事局主席唐英年）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友、各位傳媒：

大家好！今日我很高興並期待已久，因為早前Raymond已跟我預告HKBAC（香港商用航空中心）會有一個新猷，就是擴建大樓，今日終於等到。我剛才也跟Raymond主席說，他的眼光真是很好，時間剛好──現在香港經濟起飛、盛事活動做出很好的成績、世界上也有不同的商務和旅遊人士來香港，能夠目睹HKBAC新大樓竣工，我認為對於香港未來的經濟、旅遊和商業的發展有很大的幫助。

今日來到香港國際機場，一定要幫它再一次「賣告白」，多講也不怕。香港國際機場作為香港的金漆招牌，無可置疑。香港作為國際航空樞紐，無論客運、貨運的成績都一直在世界領先，若套用體育的術語，我們在全能、十項鐵人賽中成績彪炳。HKBAC在整個香港國際航空樞紐的發展裏，我會稱之為是一個最佳球員，Most Valuable Player，即MVP，當之無愧。HKBAC一直在香港國際機場裏打拼，吸引一些高端旅客。在我們整體的航空發展中，不單是客運、貨運，還有航班服務都一直提升。HKBAC連續18年獲商用航空雜誌《Professional Pilot》PRASE意見調查評為亞洲最佳公務機營運基地，是亞洲首屈一指的商務客機中心，值得我們引以為傲。

今日來到HKBAC擴建後的大樓，相信大家都很有印象，讓人感覺耳目一新。不單設計令人感到舒適，亦很實用。這標誌着HKBAC將來拓展更大業務的時候，是一個很重要的里程碑，亦給大家看到打了一支強心針。我期盼藉這個擴建計劃，能吸引更多國際商務客和旅客多來香港及選用HKBAC。

我知道在這個擴建的大樓裏可以享用一站式的服務，包括安檢、海關，還有一些辦公室，或接待傳媒的設施，有一條龍服務，客戶可因應個人需要而選取不同的服務。雖然聽聞收費不菲，但是價錢不是最重要，五星級的服務才是最重要。

說完硬件，軟件都很重要。除擴建大樓外，我知道HKBAC去年已率先提升服務。當客人坐私人飛機來到HKBAC，透過與香港機場管理局的協調和對接，可以轉乘民航客機，將轉機時間大大縮減了多達三分之一。這是相當重要的，因為作為商務客，他們對於私隱、方便會有要求，而時間亦是金錢。這個在軟件方面的提升，正正能幫助不少。

說到吸引旅客，大家可能都會感受得到，不單香港國際機場越來越繁忙，其實在市面上每周都有不同的項目。譬如今日的「一帶一路高峰論壇」，我從灣仔過來，那邊的交通都很繁忙，大家可以想像得到，香港國際機場要接待不同的國際旅客，同樣要用高效和方便的服務去吸引他們。接下來，特區政府銳意舉辦經濟相關的國際會議，以及盛事經濟等。剛才聊天的時候，我很高興得知HKBAC除了能吸引商務旅客，其實都接待了不少國際足球勁旅。在二○二五年上半年，商用航空中心處理超過30班商務航班，當中的商務客是來港處理上市事宜，成績令人鼓舞。

運動方面，香港的足球盛事一浪接一浪。足球勁旅訪港時都會選用HKBAC，配合其出行需要，並且接待傳媒或球迷。希望透過你們這個招牌，幫助我們的盛事經濟，吸引多些類似的體育活動明星來港。

航空方面，本月底會在香港舉辦一個世界航線發展大會2025，屆時將匯聚逾3 000名來自世界各地的航空業領袖及團隊。HKBAC將會發揮一個很重要的關鍵角色，亦可展示香港在這方面所提供的服務。除了這個HKBAC客運大樓，我相信slot（升降時刻）是很重要的。我聽到民航處處長說，正正因為現時三跑道系統已經落成，香港國際機場的整體運力提升了五成。我們暫時都應該還有slot，希望Vivien（香港商用航空中心行政總裁劉敏儀）你們着力吸引更多客人。民航航班數量都一直上升，所以HKBAC要盡快去爭取和不同地方的商務協作，希望可以盡量利用我們現在所增加的一些班次時刻。

今日在活動上見到Fred和Vivian（香港機場管理局行政總裁張李佳蕙），都想和大家宣傳一下機管局的SKYTOPIA，現時正默默招商引資。這個地標正正是一個香港做招商引資的縮影，SKYTOPIA當中的元素就如香港，匯集商務、經濟、文化、旅遊、餐飲、藝術、展覽場地和演唱會。其實在香港能想得到的活動，Fred和Vivian都想好了，最重要是要吸引客人，當中不少是高端客戶，希望這個計劃可以給予大家多一個契機，拓展HKBAC的業務。我們也很希望透過SKYTOPIA，吸引多些內地或國際的旅客來港，促進香港作為內地與國際一個「超級聯繫人」的角色。

最後我衷心期盼HKBAC今日這個里程碑可以幫助我們，帶領香港國際機場的業務蒸蒸日上，繼續把我們這個金漆招牌擦得更光、更亮。多謝大家。"

​立法會主席就《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》會見傳媒的發言（只有中文）,2025-09-10 18:20,2025-09-10 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000726.htm,"下稿代立法會秘書處發出：

以下是立法會主席梁君彥議員今日（九月十日）於立法會綜合大樓會見傳媒的發言：

各位傳媒朋友，立法會剛剛審議了《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》（《條例草案》），法案未獲出席議員過半數贊成，未能通過二讀。就此，我想同大家分享幾點。

《條例草案》源於二○二三年九月五日終審法院在一案中裁定，根據《香港人權法案》第十四條所保障的私生活權利，政府有積極義務立法確立替代框架，讓同性伴侶關係獲得法律承認。政府向立法會提出《條例草案》。

立法會向來支持行政長官和特區政府施政。政府提出《條例草案》時，社會各界已有很多爭論。議員成立了法案委員會，與政府當局舉行了四次會議，認真討論了《條例草案》的政策理念，並細心逐條審議法案條文，正反意見互相交鋒，同時邀請公眾人士提出意見。法案委員會共收到超過一萬份公眾意見書，當中大概超過八成表示反對《條例草案》，而表示支持的意見書只有大約百分之十九。

根據《基本法》，立法會的職權包括制定、修改和廢除法律，以及監察政府工作。無論立法會通過或不通過政府的法案；議員對法案投贊成抑或反對票，只要權力行使得恰當，便符合憲制秩序。

在審議《條例草案》的整個過程中，立法會一直嚴謹、依法履行職責。在今日的會議上，經過大約四小時的充分辯論，議員各抒己見，立法會最終投票否決《條例草案》二讀。這完全符合《基本法》規定，不會影響香港特區憲制秩序。

事實上，《條例草案》涉及極具爭議性的道德議題。香港是一個很開放的社會，但同時仍然是恪守一男一女婚姻制度的社會。今日的投票結果，可說是實際反映了今日香港社會的主流民意和價值觀。

我要強調，立法會一如既往尊重法庭判決、堅守法治原則，但鑑於《條例草案》涉及重大道德議題，立法會議員必須兼顧香港社會的實際情況，包括傳統價值觀、社會整體利益、公眾意見和期望。議員綜合考慮各項因素後，憑良心投票。這正正體現了在行政主導下，行政、立法和司法機關各司其職、互相尊重、互相制衡，而大家都是本着同一理念、同一目標，就是為香港做事、為香港好。

今次《條例草案》雖然未獲通過，但我認為「立法」並不是唯一解決方法。香港是一個很包容的城市，一直都很尊重不同性取向人士的生活方式。立法會期望（與）政府及社會各界繼續坦誠交流，促進共識，為將來有序推動相關議題和解決方案創造更有利的條件。立法會亦會繼續依法支持行政長官和特區政府施政。"

立法會五題：為罕見病復發及惡化的患者提供治療,2025-09-10 17:58,2025-09-10 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000561.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上陳凱欣議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的答覆︰

問題：

據悉醫院管理局（下稱「醫管局」）正參考涵蓋207種罕見病的國家罕見病目錄，建立罕見病資料庫，以便識別有關患者和檢索應診紀錄。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，根據醫管局罕見病資料庫定義，過去五年每年公立醫院急症室的罕見病患者求診宗數；當中有多少宗屬病情復發或惡化個案，以及該等個案所涉及的患者人數和當中求診次數最多的五種罕見病為何；有否統計該等患者由抵達急症室至接受治療的最長和中位數時間為何；

（二）是否知悉，醫管局醫護人員如何利用罕見病資料庫，在臨床應用層面協助診治罕見病患者，尤其是該等因病情復發或惡化而於非預約時間求診的患者；及

（三）鑑於一些復發率高的罕見病（例如視神經脊髓炎），若無適時用藥會造成不可逆轉的損傷，政府是否知悉，醫管局會否就該等罕見病成立跨專科專家小組，定期檢討治療方案及急症室處理有關病人的流程，並制訂相關臨床指引和黃金治療時間，以加快對該等病人的診治？

答覆：

主席：

就陳凱欣議員的提問，經諮詢醫管局（醫院管理局）後，現綜合回覆如下：

醫管局很重視為所有病人（包括罕見病患者）提供適切的治療。

國際間對於罕見疾病並沒有一致的定義。為強化對罕見病患者的臨床支援及提升診斷治療的能力，醫管局參考涵蓋207種罕見病的國家罕見病目錄，建立罕見病資料庫。醫管局臨床醫療管理系統備存所有病人（包括罕見病患者）的臨床數據和不同疾病類別的資料，醫生會在為目錄內涵蓋的罕見病患者提供治療時，於臨床醫療管理系統的應診紀錄中輸入相關診斷編碼，以識別罕見病患者，並相應提供適切治療。隨着醫管局累積更多治療罕見病的本地經驗及臨床數據，臨床醫療管理系統內罕見病患者的資料庫將得以擴充，為醫療服務規劃和臨床診斷治療提供很重要的參考。截至今年六月三十日，醫管局臨床醫療管理系統已全數收錄了國家罕見病目錄中所涵蓋的207種罕見病，總個案數目約為63 600宗。

根據醫管局的統計數字，全港一些較不罕見的五類罕見病患者依次為：胃腸間質瘤、全身型重症肌無力、早產兒視網膜病、遺傳性低鎂血症及真性紅血球增多症。當中大部分罕見病患者確診後都可在門診跟進，只有少數患者需要入院接受治療。病人若因病情需要前往急症室求診，醫護人員會根據其臨床情況提供適切的治療。

應對罕見病方面的主要挑戰在於病例很少，令診斷和治療比較困難。罕見病的症狀很多時候並不典型及缺乏一些特定性，亦往往與常見不適很相似，同時有機會影響多個器官系統，導致患者在不同的專科診室之間求診，未能全面了解疾病的狀況。除臨床檢查外，確診亦可能需要一些高技術的測試，例如基因檢測，延長診斷過程。

針對遺傳性罕見病，例如成骨不全症及性聯遺傳型低磷酸鹽症，配合基因組醫學在香港的最新發展，醫管局的醫學遺傳服務為遺傳病（包括罕見病）患者及其家庭提供一站式的跨專業支援。患有或懷疑受各種遺傳病及其他罕見病影響的病人及其家庭會獲轉介至香港兒童醫院醫學遺傳科，接受評估、檢驗、診斷、治療、輔導，以及預防的一站式服務。本着「全人醫治」的宗旨，醫管局透過跨專業及跨部門團隊，包括醫生、護士、藥劑師、臨床心理學家、康復專科護士、物理治療師、營養師、職業治療師、語言治療師、義肢矯形師和醫務社工等，以綜合服務模式為罕見病患者提供全人醫療和復康服務。

此外，香港基因組中心自二○二一年開始展開香港基因組計劃，在公立醫院招募合資格病人及其家屬自願參與全基因組測序，涵蓋個別與基因組學及精準醫學有關的罕見病，如黏多醣症、馬凡氏綜合症等。測序結果有助精準診斷，並為預後評估及治療決策提供關鍵依據。政府未來會繼續推進落實二○二四年《施政報告》中的措施，發展精準醫療。

就題述的視神經脊髓炎（Neuromyelitis Optica），該疾病是一種極為罕見的自身免疫疾病。患者的免疫系統會攻擊自己的視神經和脊髓，造成視神經炎和脊髓炎的損傷，因此，患者一般由眼科醫生或腦神經科醫生診治，並視乎需要作出會診，及安排有關檢查。

有關病人如因病情復發，出現病徵，而須到急症室求診，會於現行的急症室分流制度下由分流護士進行評估及分流，並且根據病情的嚴重程度，決定治理的先後次序。醫管局的服務目標訂明，所有危殆的病人（即一類）會即時得到診治，即百分之一百獲即時診治。而危急及緊急，即二類和三類的病人，在抵達急症室後亦會得到優先治理，目標是絕大部分的危急病人和緊急病人分別會在15分鐘或30分鐘內獲處理。一般而言，病人若出現急性視力下降或局部神經障礙的症狀，將被分流為緊急，即是三類類別。急症室的目標是安排緊急類別的病人於30分鐘內接受診治。如病人有臨床需要，急症室會安排眼科跟進，由眼科專科醫生即時評估情況，作出臨床檢查、抽血，以及電腦掃描等檢查，以排除其他有可能導致相關病徵的情況。病人經評估後，會按病情需要，作住院或轉介到相關專科門診治療及跟進。多謝主席。"
LCQ5: Providing treatment for patients experiencing relapses or deterioration of rare diseases,2025-09-10 17:58,2025-09-10 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000562.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hoi-yan and a reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  It is learnt that the Hospital Authority (HA) is developing the Rare Diseases Database by referencing the Mainland's National Lists of Rare Diseases which contains 207 rare disease entries, with a view to facilitating the identification of the relevant patients and retrieval of their clinical records. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows, according to the definitions under HA's Rare Diseases Database, the number of cases in which rare disease patients attend the accident and emergency (A&E) departments of public hospitals for treatment in each of the past five years, and among those cases, the number involving relapses or deterioration of the diseases and the number of patients concerned, as well as the top five rare diseases with the highest number of attendances; whether it has compiled statistics on the longest and median time taken from patients arriving at the A&E departments to receiving treatment;

(2) whether it knows how HA's healthcare staff make use of the Rare Diseases Database to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of rare disease patients in terms of clinical applications, in particular those patients seeking treatment without scheduled appointments due to relapses or deterioration of the diseases; and

(3) given that irreversible damage could be caused to patients suffering from certain rare diseases with high relapse rates (such as neuromyelitis optica) if timely medical treatment is not administered, whether the Government knows if HA will set up a multi-specialty expert panel in respect of such rare diseases to regularly review treatment protocols and the procedures for handling the patients concerned by the A&E departments, as well as to formulate the relevant clinical guidelines and define the golden hours for treatment so as to expedite diagnosis and treatment for such patients?

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Hospital Authority (HA), the consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Hoi-yan is as follows:

  The HA attaches high importance to providing optimal care for all patients, including those with rare diseases.

  There is no common definition of rare diseases worldwide. To enhance clinical support for patients with rare diseases and improve diagnostic and treatment capabilities, the HA has developed the Rare Diseases Database by referencing the National Lists of Rare Diseases which contains 207 rare disease entities. The HA's Clinical Management System (CMS) maintains clinical data for all patients, including those with rare diseases, alongside information on various disease categories. When providing treatment for patients with rare diseases covered under the lists, doctors will input the relevant diagnosis codes in the consultation records in the HA's CMS to identify patients with rare diseases and provide appropriate care accordingly. As the HA accumulates more local experience in treating rare diseases and clinical data, the database of rare disease patients in the CMS will become more extensive, providing important reference for healthcare service planning as well as clinical diagnosis and treatment. As at June 30 this year, the HA's CMS has recorded all 207 diseases listed in the National Lists of Rare Diseases, with a total of about 63 600 cases.

  According to statistics from the HA, the five types of rare diseases that are relatively less uncommon in Hong Kong are, in order of prevalence: gastrointestinal stromal tumor, generalised myasthenia gravis, retinopathy of prematurity, hereditary hypomagnesemia, and polycythemia vera. After diagnosis, most of these rare disease patients can be managed through out-patient follow-ups, with only a small number requiring hospitalisation for treatment. Where patients are required to attend the accident and emergency (A&E) department due to medical needs, healthcare staff will provide appropriate treatment based on their clinical conditions.

  The primary challenge in dealing with rare diseases lies in the small number of cases, resulting in difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. Symptoms of rare diseases are often atypical and non-specific, frequently resembling common ailments. Additionally, these symptoms may affect multiple organ systems, leading patients to consult various medical specialties without obtaining a comprehensive understanding of their condition. Apart from clinical examinations, diagnosis may also require some high technology testings, such as genetic testings, thereby prolonging the diagnostic process.

  For hereditary rare diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta and X-linked hypophosphataemia, the clinical genetics service of the HA provides one-stop cross-disciplinary support for patients with genetic disorders (including rare diseases) and their families, in line with the latest developments in genomic medicine in Hong Kong. Patients who are affected or suspected to be affected by various genetic diseases and other rare diseases as well as their families will be referred to the Department of Clinical Genetics of Hong Kong Children's Hospital for one-stop services, including assessment, testing, diagnosis, treatment, counselling and prevention services. Adhering to the principle of ""providing holistic care for patients"", the HA adopts an integrated service model in providing holistic medical and rehabilitation services to patients with rare diseases through multi-disciplinary and inter-departmental teams, comprising doctors, nurses, pharmacists, clinical psychologists, rehabilitation specialty nurses, physiotherapists, dietitians, occupational therapists, speech therapists, prosthetist-orthotists, medical social workers, etc.

  In addition, the Hong Kong Genome Institute launched the Hong Kong Genome Project since 2021, covering rare diseases associated with genomics and precision medicine, such as mucopolysaccharidosis and Marfan syndrome. Eligible patients and their family members are recruited through public hospitals to undergo whole genome sequencing on a voluntary basis. The sequencing results assist precise diagnoses and provide key basis for prognosis assessment and treatment decisions. The Government will continue to advance the implementation of the initiative under the 2024 Policy Address in developing precision medicine.

  Regarding Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) as mentioned in the question, it is an extremely rare autoimmune disorder in which the immune system of the patient attacks his/her own optic nerves and spinal cord, causing damages to optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. As a result, patients are typically managed by ophthalmologists or neurologists. Joint consultations will be arranged as needed, along with relevant investigations.

  In cases where these patients need to attend the A&E department due to relapses and presentation of symptoms, they will undergo assessment and triage by nurses under the prevailing triage system at the A&E department. The treatment priority is determined based on the severity of their condition. The HA's service targets stipulate that all critical patients (Triage 1) are to receive immediate treatment (i.e. 100 per cent immediate treatment), while emergency (Triage 2) patients and urgent (Triage 3) patients will be prioritised for treatment upon arrival at the A&E department, the targets being that most of the emergency and urgent patients are to be treated within 15 minutes and 30 minutes respectively. Generally speaking, patients experiencing symptoms such as acute vision loss or focal neurological deficits will be triaged as urgent cases (i.e. Triage 3). The A&E department aims to arrange these urgent patients for treatment within 30 minutes. In case the patient concerned has clinical needs, the A&E department will refer him/her to the Department of Ophthalmology for follow-up. The ophthalmology specialist will forthwith assess the condition of the patient and conduct clinical examinations, blood tests and computerised tomography (CT) scans etc, to rule out other conditions that may cause the relevant symptoms. After assessment, patients may be arranged for hospitalisation or referred to the relevant specialist out-patient clinics for treatment and follow-up subject to their conditions. Thank you, President."
SFST's keynote speech at Forum on Sustainability Disclosures (English only) (with photos),2025-09-10 17:42,2025-09-10 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000625.htm,"  Following is the keynote speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the Forum on Sustainability Disclosures today (September 10):

Kelvin (Chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Dr Kelvin Wong), Julia (Chief Executive Officer of the Securities and Futures Commission, Ms Julia Leung), Emmanuel (Chief Executive Officer of the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial Services Regulatory Authority, Mr Emmanuel Givanakis), Mark (Chief Executive of the Dubai Financial Services Authority, Mr Mark Steward), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. It is my pleasure to join you all at the Forum on Sustainability Disclosures today to exchange views on this topic with growing importance globally. First of all, I would like to thank the Securities and Futures Commission, our co-organiser of today's event, and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), our event partner, for joining hands with our bureau (Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau) to promote the development of a comprehensive sustainability disclosure ecosystem in Hong Kong. Today's Forum is one of the fruits of our joint effort, providing a platform for vibrant exchanges of expertise, ideas and global collaboration to foster sustainability disclosures in the global capital market. Also, amid the current complicated geopolitical environment, we are also here to reaffirm our commitment in driving the sustainability agenda together with our partners.

  Having accurate, comparable and consistent information on sustainability-related topics, as highlighted by Kelvin just now, is vital for making informed decisions, evaluating climate-related risks, and fostering innovation in sustainable financing. This is why sustainability disclosures are attracting fast-growing global awareness. Today we will explore together the path ahead for the global and local adoption of the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) - Sustainability Disclosure Standards (ISSB Standards). We will also discuss how disclosures can drive significant progress in sustainability development and facilitating financing and investments for real economy transition, climate adaption and mitigation in Hong Kong, the region, and beyond.

  Hong Kong is a leading international financial centre and a hub for green and sustainable finance. Last year, the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong amounted to around US$43 billion, capturing around 45 per cent of the regional total and ranking first in the Asian market for seven consecutive years since 2018. Besides, as of June 2025, the number of environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds authorised by the SFC was over 200 with assets under management reaching HK$1.1 trillion and more. The number of ESG funds and assets under management recorded an increase of 51 per cent and 18 per cent respectively from three years ago. At the same time, we are committed to enhancing our competitiveness by adhering to the international standards and best practices, and have taken big steps in achieving this goal.

Sustainability disclosures

  Following the release of the first set of the ISSB Standards back in 2023, the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government published a vision statement in March last year, outlining our vision and approach in building a comprehensive ecosystem for sustainability disclosure in Hong Kong. Since then, listed companies, financial institutions, investors and industry organisations have been engaged in the consultation to identify Hong Kong-specific circumstances that should be taken into account when developing the Hong Kong Sustainability Disclosure Standards (Hong Kong Standards) which is in full alignment with the ISSB Standards. We are happy that the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), as the sustainability reporting standard setter in Hong Kong, published last December the Hong Kong Standards, which are fully aligned with the ISSB Standards.

  After the release of our vision statement, we continued to work closely with financial regulators and stakeholders in ironing out the steps and timeline for Hong Kong's full adoption of the ISSB Standards. We launched in December last year the Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in Hong Kong, detailing the approach to require publicly accountable entities (PAEs) to adopt the ISSB Standards. This roadmap provides a clear pathway for large PAEs to adopt fully the ISSB Standards no later than 2028.

  Since the launch of the Roadmap, we have made progressive moves towards our target. For listed issuers, the HKEX has implemented in phases since January this year new climate-related disclosures requirements under its Listing Rules (New Climate Requirements), which are developed based on IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures. The New Climate Requirements aim to prepare companies to start climate reporting early in accordance with provisions of the ISSB Standards. The HKEX will consult the market in 2027 on mandating sustainability reporting against the Hong Kong Standards for listed PAEs, with an expected effective date of January 2028 under a proportionate approach. For the financial industry, our financial regulators will conduct sector-specific engagements to determine the approach and timing of adopting the Hong Kong Standards for different financial sectors. Subject to stakeholders' comments and feedback, relevant financial regulators will require non-listed financial institutions carrying a significant weight (i.e. non-listed PAEs) to apply the Hong Kong Standards no later than 2028.

  We are proud that the IFRS Foundation, in its publication of the jurisdictional profiles on adoption of the ISSB Standards this June, confirms Hong Kong as among the initial set of jurisdictions having set a target of fully adopting the ISSB Standards. This underscores our commitment to enhancing the transparency of information on sustainable development in the capital markets, enabling investors to make informed investment decisions and promoting global capital flows.

  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the ISSB for its support and continuous engagements with relevant stakeholders in Hong Kong during our journey on the full adoption of ISSB Standards.

Sustainability assurance

  To support smooth and practical implementation of sustainability disclosure requirements, a comprehensive and robust ecosystem encompassing aspects such as sustainability assurance, data and technology, as well as skills and competencies is vital. For sustainability assurance, the HKICPA issued in March this year the Hong Kong Standard on Sustainability Assurance 5000 which fully converges with the International Standard on Sustainability Assurance 5000 published by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. It will develop the local ethics standards for sustainability assurance, which will be on a full convergence basis with the International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance published by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, for publication within this year. The Accounting and Financial Reporting Council is also working with relevant financial regulators and stakeholders with a view to releasing a proposed local regulatory framework for sustainability assurance for public consultation within this year.

Data and technology

  Promoting data and technology is one of our key priorities to promote the availability and accessibility of sustainability-related information. We have launched a number of tools to support enterprises, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in sustainability reporting. For example, a Climate and Environmental Risk Questionnaire for non-listed companies/SMEs was launched three years ago to provide a free and easy-to-use sustainability reporting template to corporates in need, facilitating their understanding of their sustainability performance and raising their sustainability profiles to lenders, investors and supply chain clients. We are now enhancing the Questionnaire to make it more accessible and inclusive.

  Another example is the greenhouse gas emissions calculation and estimation tools we launched in February last year. The tools are free for public use and aim to help corporations manage their environmental footprint while encouraging market participants to improve their sustainable development practices. The tools also clearly disclose the methodology and data sources, and incorporate Hong Kong and Mainland elements into the calculation and estimation models. Going forward, we will continue to enhance the tools and collaborate with different stakeholders to facilitating better sustainability disclosures with the use of these tools.

Skills and competencies

  Last but not least, we are committed to strengthening capacity building to assist the industry and companies in their journey towards sustainability disclosures. The HKSAR Government will continue to support industry capacity building through our Pilot Green and Sustainable Finance Capacity Building Support Scheme launched three years ago, and the Scheme will be extended to 2028. Besides, financial regulators, the HKEX and the HKICPA, have been organising conferences, seminars and other stakeholder exchange activities to promote alignment with the ISSB Standards and support capacity building efforts locally, regionally and internationally. These engagement activities and relevant training programmes help to nurture skilled sustainable finance professionals including preparers, reporting and assurance professionals, and sustainability-related service providers.

  By collaborating and working together, we can definitely build a sustainable and resilient future. Before I wish all of you a fruitful day, normally these days, forums can't finish without mentioning AI. Just before I came to this stage, I checked on my app in terms of what word it would use to describe Hong Kong and also sustainability disclosure. There are a number of choices, of course it depends on which app you use and also what time of the day that you use it. One of the key words is actually ""ecosystem"".

  I think the app describes what I just described, basically it's about who to provide, what to provide and how to provide the information. I'm sure in the coming days and also this forum, you will be having a lot of insightful discussions and exchanges, in particular how Hong Kong can be a better ecosystem on sustainability disclosures for not just Hong Kong but also for the region and the world. Thank you."
醫務衞生局局長會見傳媒談流感疫苗（只有中文）,2025-09-10 17:34,2025-09-10 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000644.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（九月十日）出席立法會會議後會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：（有關政府採購流感疫苗時的考慮）另外，政府有「先入先出」原則，但對於一些學校學生來說，家長不能選擇疫苗的品牌，會否擔心家長會選擇到私營機構打針，或者索性不安排小朋友打針，會否擔心令流感爆發﹖

醫務衞生局局長：滅活疫苗在全球已使用超過50年，是一個非常成熟的疫苗技術。在新冠疫情期間，我們都知道滅活疫苗，特別是科興疫苗，在香港廣泛應用達900萬劑，足以證明其質量安全和效力，這對抗疫非常重要。我們在考慮疫苗的註冊時，一貫採用非常高的標準，根據其質量安全，以及效能，並根據藥廠提供的數據作註冊，所以所有符合審批註冊標準的，我們都會列入考慮方案中。關於疫苗採購，我們一直都堅持多元化，因為疫苗的供應，特別是季節性流感，其供應會受到許多因素影響。我們為了要確保這些疫苗的供應不會受到某些因素影響，必須多元化，從不同的途徑去採購疫苗，整個過程都是根據最高標準。

科興疫苗方面，它確實是沒有一些有關孕婦應用的臨床研究數據，但是不表示孕婦不適合用，科興疫苗沒有對孕婦列為禁忌症，故此，是可以使用的。不過，因為它沒有針對孕婦而做的臨床數據，雖然滅活疫苗本身對孕婦是安全的，對嬰兒亦沒有影響，但在藥廠提供的指引中，就列出應與醫生商量以作判斷和風險評估後才採用。

至於本港，每年流感疫苗，例如上年接種超過200萬劑。孕婦方面，我們計算大概每年有6 000名孕婦接種流感疫苗，佔總數量比較少。如果孕婦與醫生評估後，決定不用科興疫苗，她亦可以選擇其他的一些選擇。我們採購的賽諾菲三價滅活疫苗，都是滅活疫苗，不過是三價，有孕婦使用的臨床數據，所以她們可以使用的。賽諾菲三價滅活疫苗我們購買超過90萬劑，對於那幾千名孕婦的需求，是絕對沒有問題的。

至於在學校的疫苗接種方面，我一定要強調，所有我們現在採購的兩種滅活疫苗，都是安全的，亦是適合給所有的市民使用，包括兒童。在對抗流感方面，大家都很清晰，最近很不幸有幾宗嚴重個案，我們對抗流感必須做好準備工作，而流感疫苗接種是最重要的一環。我在此重申，兒童、他們的家長，最重要是要接種流感疫苗。學校外展計劃可以提供噴鼻式疫苗，也可以混合，某些同學希望用噴鼻式，亦有一些用注射的滅活疫苗，都可以給他們一個選擇。如果有些非常少數的學校不參與外展，家長亦可以選擇到私營醫療診所接受接種。"

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-09-10 17:30,2025-09-10 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000620.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（九月十日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱的輸入個案。

最新個案資料

新增個案涉及一名居於深水埗區的五歲男童，他於七月十五日至八月三十一日與家人到訪廣東省鶴山市和鄰近的佛山市。病人於九月五日出現發燒、九月七日出現皮疹，翌日到明愛醫院急症室求診，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。他的三名家居接觸者（包括兩名一同到鶴山市的人士）現時沒有出現病徵，並正接受醫學監察。

由於病人於潛伏期身處鶴山市，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得14宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案（八宗來自廣東省、四宗孟加拉國、一宗印度尼西亞及一宗斯里蘭卡）。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月三十一日至九月六日）廣東省新增178宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較過去兩周分別225宗（八月二十四日至三十日）及336宗（八月十七日至二十三日）進一步減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然廣東省的情況在八月下旬起已受到控制，每日只有零星新增個案，但現時全球多國仍爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-10 17:30,2025-09-10 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000616.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 10), onenew imported case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

 The new case involves a five-year-old boy living in Sham Shui Po District. He visited Heshan City and the neighboring Foshan City in Guangdong Province with his family between July 15 and August 31. The patient developed a fever on September 5 and a rash on September 7. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Caritas Medical Centre the next day and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. He is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing. His three household contacts, including two persons who travelled to Heshan with the boy,are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since the patient stayed in Heshan during the incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 14 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases (eight from Guangdong Province, four from Bangladesh, one from Indonesia and one from Sri Lanka). From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 178 new CF cases in Guangdong during the past week (August 31 to September 6), showing a further decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 225 cases (August 24 to 30) and 336 cases (August 17 to 23) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the situation in Guangdong Province has been under control since late August, with only sporadic new cases reported each day, CF outbreaks continue in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

â
The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Also attending the meeting was the Deputy Financial Secretary, Mr Michael Wong.

ããMr Lee welcomed Mr Sun and his delegation to Hong Kong to attend the 10th Belt and Road Summit and to serve as a keynote speaker. Noting that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is actively exploring emerging markets in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Belt and Road countries, Mr Lee said that Cambodia, with its rapid market development and vast economic potential, offers broad opportunities for co-operation between the two places. Hong Kong and Cambodia reached 13 Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) last year, covering areas such as economics and trade, aviation, and financial services. Mr Lee said he was pleased to witness more MOUs between government departments of the two places at today's Summit, which will further enhance bilateral exchanges and co-operation.

ããMr Lee said that Cambodia is a strategic partner in the country's promotion of the Belt and Road Initiative, while Hong Kong possesses a highly internationalised, market-oriented and business-friendly environment with strengths in capital, technology and market resources that enable it to fully serve as a functional platform to help both places seize the opportunities from the Belt and Road Initiative, fostering economic and trade development and achieving mutual benefits and win-win outcomes. He welcomed enterprises from Cambodia to leverage Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" to explore overseas and Mainland markets.

ããMr Lee thanked Cambodia for its support in establishing the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed). He said that the establishment of the IOMed headquarters in Hong Kong demonstrates the city's unique advantages and strengths in international mediation to further promote international exchanges and co-operation. Hong Kong will continue to leverage its advantages of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world, thereby contributing to the promotion of the development of the Belt and Road Initiative."
立法會：運輸及物流局局長動議二讀《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》發言全文（只有中文）,2025-09-10 17:28,2025-09-10 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000639.htm,"​以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上動議二讀《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》的發言全文：

主席：

我謹動議二讀《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》（《條例草案》）。

隨着科技進步和出行模式改變，透過網絡預約個人化點對點交通服務在世界各地已相當普及，香港作為一個國際大都會，情況亦不例外。今屆特區政府抱着破局的決心，引入清晰的法律框架規管網約車服務解決這個多年的爭議。政府提出的規管框架，將市民利益放在首位，目標是讓市民有更多安全、合法合規和多元化的出行選擇。同時，我們亦會兼顧司機的生意，吸引新血入行，促進點對點行業的健康和有序發展，希望為行業帶來全新景象。

網約車的議題複雜，牽涉多方面的因素和不同持份者，各界就着規管細節意見紛陳。不過，不論是市民、的士業界，還是網約車平台公司，他們都有一個非常清晰明確的共識，就是政府應該早日規管網約車服務，一方面保障乘客安全，滿足市民的出行需要，另一方面也為整體個人化點對點交通服務締造一個良性的競爭環境。

我們就有關議題在今年七月諮詢立法會交通事務委員會時，議員一致支持政府就提供網約車服務的平台、車輛及司機作出規管，亦同時支持政府全速推進立法工作，以期能夠讓規管制度早日「落地」，回應社會各界的訴求。在此，我衷心感謝各個議員的支持，以及他們就規管框架所提出的寶貴意見。

在過去一段時間，我們一直密鑼緊鼓籌劃規管框架和草擬有關法律條文，並繼續虛心聆聽各界意見，理性務實調整立法建議，希望有關規管框架在保障市民出行安全的同時，亦能鼓勵行業發展。今日，我向立法會提交《條例草案》，踏出立法方案的第一步，透過修訂《道路交通條例》，先就規管框架確立原則性的事宜，並為下一階段的工作提供法律基礎。我們會在下一屆立法會會期開展後，透過附屬法例進一步訂定規管的技術細節。視乎立法和其他準備工作的進度，我期望首批持牌的網約車平台可於二○二六年第四季內開始營運。

為了保障乘客的出行安全和權益，我們在《條例草案》中要求提供網約車服務的平台、私家車和司機三方都需要領有合適的牌證。日後，合法的網約車服務必須符合三大條件，包括（1）通過持牌平台預約和安排；（2）提供服務的私家車領有網約車車輛許可證；以及（3）駕駛有關車輛的司機領有網約車車輛駕駛許可證。違反上述條件提供網約車服務屬於非法載客取酬，須負上刑責。

在建議的規管框架下，任何提供網約車平台服務的電子或電訊平台都需要領取網約車服務牌照。持牌平台必須為在香港註冊的公司，並符合指定的入場門檻，包括在營運經驗、財力證明、資本投入、董事資格等各方面，以確保持牌平台具備足夠的營運能力提供優質的網約車服務。

持牌平台須維持適當且具效率的服務，並對旗下車輛和司機進行盡職審查，確保他們領有合適的許可證。此外，平台亦須並備存妥善的營運紀錄並向運輸署署長提交。運輸署會監察平台的營運，並就牌照施加條件。如果日後平台違反牌照條件或法定要求，視乎嚴重程度，運輸署署長可以施加罰款，更改或暫時吊銷牌照，甚至取消牌照。

提供網約車服務的私家車必須持有車輛許可證，並購買合適的第三者風險保險；在申請或每年續領許可證時，車齡須低於12年並符合有關驗車的要求。此外，車輛須由個人名義登記並只能由登記車主提供服務，在營運時亦須按規定展示標識以供識別。「人車綁定」的安排有助吸引真正有意提供有質素網約車服務的人士加入行業，亦避免衍生網約車租賃市場，令車輛許可證淪為具炒賣價值的資產或出現黑工司機的情況。

至於司機方面，司機須領有網約車車輛駕駛許可證才可提供網約車服務，並須符合指定的條件，包括年滿21歲、持有香港永久性居民身份證、五年內沒有嚴重交通定罪紀錄，並完成指定考核等。

我們建議將來申請的士及網約車駕駛資格的人士可參與同一個簡化的筆試，而已持有的士駕駛執照的人士，可無須再次考試便可向運輸署申請駕駛許可證。當然日後考的士執照的人士，參與筆試後，他們亦可以申請駕駛網約車，並領取網約車司機許可證。有關措施可有助改善司機短缺以及老化的情況，壯大香港現時的司機供應、吸引新血入行，最重要是推動整個點對點行業的持續發展。

上述各項的牌證要求既可保障乘客安全和利益，亦有助提升和締造良性競爭的環境，讓的士和網約車發揮各自的優勢，為市民提供優質服務。的士與網約車絕對不是零和博弈，而是共存互補。在引入規範化的網約車後，的士獨特和固有的優勢，包括他們可以在街上截乘乘客、可使用遍布全港各區的的士站、禁區上落客等，這些一一的優勢以及獨特性將維持不變；而網約車亦可透過共享經濟的模式釋放閒置運力，為市民提供更多元化的選擇。我們相信透過引入規管制度，可達致的士、網約車、市民多方共贏。

在考慮車輛許可證的數目時，我們必須顧及香港獨特的實際情況。香港城市發展密度高，每日有接近九成市民使用高效的公交系統出行，如果無限制地發出車輛許可證很可能會引發負面效果，例如交通擠塞，影響公交系統生態；或導致市場惡性競爭，令整體司機生意和行業發展受到影響。因此，政府有需要對網約車的數目實施總量控制，並會在下一階段透過附屬法例訂明有關數目。在訂定限額時，我們會小心審慎地考慮多個因素，包括市民的召車經驗、平台營運需要，公共交通系統生態，以及道路承載力等。

引入網約車規管制度有助大幅提升對乘客的保障。不過，考慮到可能仍有少數不法分子以私家車非法取酬載客，《條例草案》除了是就我剛才所說，對平台車輛以及司機都有作出明確的規管以及罰則外，我們藉着今次的《條例草案》亦加強罰則，以更有效打擊「白牌車」，保障乘客和合法合規的個人化點對點交通服務。根據現時法例，因非法取酬載客而被定罪的司機可被處監禁和罰款，亦可被停牌一段時間。為加強阻嚇力，《條例草案》訂明停牌時間須不少於12個月，並可長達三年。《條例草案》亦訂明若持牌平台安排沒有持有許可證的車輛或司機提供網約車服務，除了相關車主和司機可被處監禁和罰款外，持牌平台亦須負上刑責。

另外，根據現行法例，當司機因非法取酬載客被定罪後，運輸署可暫時吊銷涉事車輛的牌照，並扣押有關車輛一段期間。我們會藉着這次修改主體法例時引入這條《條例草案》內，建議強化暫時吊銷相關車輛牌照及扣押車輛的安排：當車輛涉嫌干犯非法取酬載客的罪行時，就算未能識辨涉事司機而作出刑事檢控，仍有機制暫時吊銷車輛牌照和扣押車輛。政府正敲定具體程序的細節，並積極進行相關的法律草擬工作。

主席，政府在推動網約車服務的規管框架時，一直秉持「以民為本、良性競爭、共存互補」的宗旨。我相信引入規管制度可有助重塑在香港個人化點對點公共交通服務，讓服務邁向現代化、司機年輕化和市民選擇多元化。政府會全力配合立法會的審議工作，我亦理解有關的立法工作相當緊迫和緊湊，我在此承諾我以及我的團隊會全力配合，並以高效回覆各議員以及在法案委員會提出的提問，我在此懇請議員支持《條例草案》，讓《條例草案》可趕及在今屆立法會會期完結前通過。

主席，我謹此陳辭。"

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰會由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。
​
根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。
​
入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外傭）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"
Immigration Department arrests 11 persons during operations targeting foreign domestic helpers who breach conditions of stay (with photo),2025-09-10 17:17,2025-09-10 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000635.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Swordfish"", for five consecutive days from September 5 to 9, targeting foreign domestic helpers who breached their conditions of stay. A total of 11 persons, including six suspected illegal workers and five suspected employers, were arrested.

  During the operation, ImmD investigators raided 28 target locations including restaurants, bars and commercial and residential buildings. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised six women, aged 23 to 48. Among them, two persons were current helpers, two persons were overstaying ex-helpers, and two persons were found to be holders of recognisance forms, which prohibit them from taking any employment in Hong Kong. ImmD investigators found most of the suspected illegal workers at restaurants performing dishwashing, cleaning, etc. Meanwhile, five suspected employers, comprising two men and three women, aged 29 to 50, were in charge of the involved companies or restaurants and suspected of employing the suspected illegal workers.

  ""A helper should only perform domestic duties for the employer specified in the contract. The helper should not take up any other employment, including part-time domestic duties, with any other person. The employer should not require or allow the helper to carry out any work for any other person,"" an ImmD spokesman said.

  The spokesman also said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him/her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  In addition, the spokesman warned that, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter, temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."

立法會二十二題：長者健康中心,2025-09-10 17:10,2025-09-10 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000532.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上陳振英議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

衞生署在全港設有18間長者健康中心，65歲或以上的長者可申請成為會員，但據悉目前輪候成為新會員時間較長，截至今年六月，該18間中心仍在處理二○二三年或更早期遞交的申請。另一方面，為減少服務重疊，基層醫療署計劃將長者健康中心的服務分階段整合至各區的地區康健中心。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年各區長者健康中心的以下資料：接獲的會員申請宗數、新增會員及總會員人數、申請成為會員的平均輪候時間，以及健康檢查、治療、注射及敷藥等主要服務的平均輪候時間；

（二）有否檢視長者健康中心處理會員申請需時甚長的原因為何；有否採取措施以提升處理會員申請的速度及效率；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）整合長者健康中心的服務至地區康健中心的時間表及過渡安排為何？

答覆：

主席：

為提升市民健康，改善醫療保障及質量，發揮醫療專業優勢，《行政長官2024年施政報告》提出，政府會全面審視醫療體系的定位和目標，改革衞生署、醫院管理局（醫管局）和基層醫療署的職能和分工，強化基層醫療，促進健康和疾病預防。衞生署會逐步把其專科和基層醫療服務分別轉移至醫管局和基層醫療署，以集中資源強化其規管事務和衞生防護等。其中，基層醫療署會分階段為整合衞生署轄下的長者健康中心服務至地區康健網絡作準備，以加強服務協同效應，按長者需要作適切安排。

就陳振英議員的提問，經諮詢衞生署後，本局現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）現時，衞生署在全港18區每區均設有一間長者健康中心，為年滿65歲的人士以家庭醫學模式提供綜合基層健康服務，包括健康評估、健康輔導、健康教育和診療服務。凡年滿65歲的人士均可到任何一間長者健康中心申請成為長者健康中心的會員。

另一方面，政府已於二○二二年在全港18區設立地區康健中心或地區康健站（以下統稱為地區康健中心）。現時，地區康健中心向所有市民（包括長者）提供健康風險評估、制定個人化健康計劃、登記參加「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」、配對家庭醫生和安排專屬護士診所及／或專職醫療服務等服務。

過去三年，在各長者健康中心每年接獲的新會員申請宗數載於下表。新申請宗數有下降趨勢，原因包括因應地區康健中心的設立，長者選擇到地區康健中心接受健康評估及服務等。

長者健康中心新登記人數及總登記人數在二○二四年均明顯下跌，而接受首次健康評估的輪候時間中位數在二○二四年則於大部分長者健康中心明顯較長。輪候時間中位數在該年較長的主要原因包括於2019冠狀病毒病疫情期間，長者健康中心由二○二○年一月至二○二三年二月只能提供有限度的服務而積壓部分申請。另外，雖然二○二三年二月開始，長者健康中心的服務已回復正常，但鑑於輪候申請人數已累積至一定數量，而且衞生署醫生人手持續短缺，影響了服務量，這也導致二○二四年的新登記人數及總登記人數下跌。

衞生署與基層醫療署商討分階段整合長者健康中心服務至地區康健網絡的同時，亦已增聘了合約醫生以加強人手應對，並會繼續密切監察情況。

（三）考慮到現時長者健康中心的服務容量，政府有需要改變服務模式，更好利用社區基層醫療資源，以提升服務效率，應對人口老化相關醫療需求的迫切問題。

為加強香港基層醫療服務，政府於二○二二年十二月公布《基層醫療健康藍圖》（《藍圖》），重點提出一系列改革措施。隨着以地區為本、以家庭為中心的社區醫療系統不斷發展，《藍圖》建議衞生署轄下的一些基層醫療健康服務，包括長者健康中心，應逐步並有序地整合至基層醫療系統，以便發展社區醫療系統，提供整體及全面的基層醫療服務，提升資源運用效率。為落實《藍圖》和《行政長官2024年施政報告》宣布的基層醫療政策方向及相關措施，基層醫療署會透過服務整合，進一步發展以地區康健中心為樞紐的跨專業基層醫療服務網絡。

基層醫療署計劃在二○二五至二六年度開始分階段為整合衞生署轄下的長者健康中心服務至地區康健網絡作準備，以加強服務協同效應，更好應對長者對基層醫療服務的需求。基層醫療署與衞生署將於稍後公布服務過渡的安排。"
​一名入境旅客管有未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-09-10 17:10,2025-09-10 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000637.htm,"一名入境女旅客因管有未完稅香煙和未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（九月十日）在粉嶺裁判法院被判處監禁八星期及罰款六百元。

海關人員昨日（九月九日）在羅湖管制站截查該名四十四歲抵港女旅客，在其攜帶的個人行李內檢獲一千五百八十一支未完稅香煙，估計市值約六千四百元，應課稅值約五千二百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，反映即使旅客屬初犯，亦可能被判處監禁，刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
LCQ22: Elderly Health Centres,2025-09-10 17:10,2025-09-10 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000541.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Chun-ying and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  The Department of Health has 18 Elderly Health Centres (EHCs) in Hong Kong. Elderly aged 65 and above can be enrolled as members of EHCs. However, it is learnt that the current waiting time for membership is relatively long. As at June this year, these 18 centres were still processing applications submitted in 2023 or earlier. On the other hand, to minimise service duplication, the Primary Healthcare Commission plans to migrate EHC services to District Health Centres (DHCs) in various districts in phases. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following information about the EHC in various districts in each of the past three years: the number of membership applications received, the number of new members and total membership, the average waiting time for membership applications, and the average waiting time for major services such as health screening, medical treatment, injection and dressing;

(2) whether it has examined the reasons for the lengthy processing time for membership applications at EHCs; whether it has taken measures to enhance the speed and efficiency of processing membership applications; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) of the timetable and transitional arrangements for migrating EHC services to DHCs?

Reply:

President,

  To enhance the health of the people of Hong Kong, improve healthcare protection and quality, and capitalise on our healthcare professions' strengths, as announced in ""The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address"", the Government will conduct a comprehensive review on the positioning and objectives of the healthcare system, which will cover the reforming of functions and division of work among the Department of Health (DH), the Hospital Authority (HA), and the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) as well as strengthening health promotion and disease prevention in primary healthcare. The DH will gradually transfer its specialist and primary healthcare services to the HA and the PHC Commission respectively, so as to concentrate its resources to strengthen its regulatory affairs and health protection, etc. Amongst others, the PHC Commission will start preparing for the service integration of the DH's Elderly Health Centres (EHCs) into the district health network in phases, with a view to enhancing service synergy and making appropriate arrangements to meet the needs of the elderly.

  In consultation with the DH, the reply by the Health Bureau to the question raised by the Hon Chan Chun-ying are as follows:

(1) and (2) At present, the DH has established an EHC in each of the 18 districts in Hong Kong to provide integrated primary healthcare services, including health assessment, counselling, health education and curative treatment, to persons aged 65 or above from a family medicine perspective. All persons aged 65 or above are eligible for enrolling as members of the EHC at any EHC.

  Meanwhile, the Government has set up District Health Centres (DHCs) or DHC Expresses (hereinafter collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts of Hong Kong in 2022. Currently, the DHCs provide services to all members of the public (including the elderly), including provision of health risk factors assessments, development of personalised health plans, signing up for the Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme, family doctor pairing, and arrangements for dedicated nurse clinics and/or allied health services.

  The number of new membership applications received annually by each EHC in the past three years are as shown in the table below. The number of new applications has shown a declining trend in view of factors such as the establishment of the DHCs and the elderly's preference for receiving health assessments and services at the DHCs.

Note: Due to the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, all EHCs underwent multiple service adjustments from 2020 to early 2023 to redeploy staff from different grades to support epidemic prevention and control. Amongst others, in view of the activation of designated clinics at Robert Black General Out-patient Clinic by the HA, based on infection control considerations at the time of the epidemic, San Po Kong EHC which was situated at the same location with the designated clinic was temporarily closed in the period from February 26, 2022, to February 5, 2023.

  The median waiting time for the first health assessment at various EHCs over the past three years is as shown in the table below. The median refers to the time the elderlies have taken to become a member and receive the first health assessment on the day since they first submitted the application.

  The number of new enrolments and total number of enrolments at the EHCs both declined significantly in 2024. Meanwhile, the median waiting time for the first health assessment was notably longer at most EHCs in 2024. Key factors contributing to the longer median waiting time in that year include the backlog of applications accumulated during the COVID-19 epidemic when the EHCs could only provide limited services from January 2020 to February 2023. Additionally, although services at the EHCs resumed normal starting from February 2023, the accumulated backlog of waiting applications and the persistent shortage of the DH's medical staff have impacted the service capacity. This has also contributed to the decline in both the number of new enrolments and the total number of enrolments in 2024.

  In addition to discussing service integration of EHCs into the district health network in phases with the PHC Commission, the DH has also recruited additional contract doctors to strengthen staffing capacity. The DH will continue to closely monitor the situation.

(3) Considering the current service capacity of the EHCs, there is a need for the Government to transform its service model to allow for better utilisation of community-based primary healthcare resources, enhance service efficiency, and respond to the pressing healthcare demands arising from an ageing population.

  To strengthen primary healthcare services in Hong Kong, the Government released the Primary Healthcare Blueprint (the Blueprint) in December 2022, setting out a series of reform initiatives. The Blueprint recommends that, in line with the development of the district-based, family-centric community health system, certain primary healthcare services under the DH, including the EHCs, be migrated to the primary healthcare system in a progressive and orderly manner. The migration aims to develop a community healthcare system that provides holistic and comprehensive primary healthcare services and utilises resources in a more effective manner. To implement the policy directions and related measures for primary healthcare set out in the Blueprint and the Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address, the PHC Commission will further expand the multidisciplinary primary healthcare service network with DHCs as hub through service integration.

  The PHC Commission plans to commence preparations in phases starting from 2025-26 for the service integration of EHCs under the DH into the district health network, with a view to enhancing service synergy and better addressing the elderly's demand for primary healthcare services. The PHC Commission and the DH will announce the service migration arrangements in due course."
Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2025-09-10 17:10,2025-09-10 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000638.htm,"  An incoming female passenger was sentenced to eight weeks' imprisonment and fined $600 by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (September 10) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

  Customs officers intercepted the incoming 44-year-old female passenger at the Lo Wu Control Point yesterday (September 9) and seized 1 581 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $6,400 and a duty potential of about $5,200 from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

  Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

  Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Hong Kong Customs detects smuggling case involving ocean-going vessel with goods worth about $140 million seized (with photo),2025-09-10 16:45,2025-09-10 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000582.htm,"Hong Kong Customs on August 26 detected a suspected case of using an ocean-going vessel to smuggle goods to Korea at the Kwai Chung Container Terminals. A large batch of suspected unmanifested goods with an estimated market value of about $140 million was seized.

Through intelligence analysis and risk assessment, Customs discovered that criminals intended to use an ocean-going vessel to smuggle goods and thus formulated strategies to combat related activities.

On August 26, Customs officers identified an ocean-going vessel preparing to depart from Hong Kong for Korea for inspection, and seized a large batch of suspected scheduled shark skin, electronic goods and parts, and liquor inside two containers on board the vessel.

An investigation is ongoing. The likelihood of arrests is not ruled out.

Customs is the primary agency responsible for tackling smuggling activities and has long been combating various smuggling activities on all fronts. Customs will keep up its enforcement action and continue to resolutely combat sea smuggling activities through proactive risk management and intelligence-based enforcement strategies, and carry out targeted anti-smuggling operations at suitable times to crack down on related crimes.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Speech by SJ at thematic breakout session of 10th Belt and Road Summit (English only) (with photos),2025-09-10 16:34,2025-09-10 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000569.htm,"Following are the welcome remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the thematic breakout session entitled Synergy in Legal Solutions: Co-creating a Shared Silk Road Vision of the 10th Belt and Road Summit today (September 10):

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is my great pleasure to welcome you all to join us in this thematic breakout session, which will focus on the legal and dispute resolution services provided by Hong Kong in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI). Before we hear from a distinguished panel of speakers, let me give a brief overview.

  Under the fundamental principle of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong enjoys a number of unique systematic strengths. Among other things, one of such strengths is its international, credible and high-quality legal and dispute resolution services based on its common law system against the background that Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction in China.

  The conclusion and execution of Belt and Road projects, irrespective of their nature, are bound to involve transboundary legal issues. In order to safeguard and promote the parties' interests, and as an essential component of risk management, international legal services are inevitable.

Non-contentious legal services

  Let me start with non-contentious legal services, for example, the drafting of contracts and other legal documents, the provision of general legal advices, and the establishment of business entities.

  All Belt and Road co-operation agreements would need to be reduced into legally enforceable contracts. When the parties come from different jurisdictions and the execution of the project itself involves different countries, one of the most important primary question is to decide on the governing law of the legal agreement. I would venture to suggest that Hong Kong law provides one of the best options. We have a bilingual legal system under which both Chinese and English are equally authentic. Our common law, in particular, international civil and commercial law and practice, are very familiar to the international business community. In the IMD (International Institute for Management Development) World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025 published in June this year, Hong Kong ranks first in the world in the sub-factor ""Business legislation"".

  One unique characteristic of our common law system is that, while it is separated from the legal system in Mainland, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) and the Mainland have entered into a number of mutual legal assistance arrangements, which would enable overseas parties to explore business opportunities in the Mainland while enjoying the benefits offered by Hong Kong's legal system. For example, these arrangements cover the mutual recognition and enforcement of court judgments in civil and commercial matters, and also arbitral awards.

  To take full advantage of the benefits offered by Hong Kong's legal system, it is most advisable to consider setting up business and corporate vehicles in Hong Kong for the purpose of executing co-operation or joint-venture agreements under the B&RI. The most obvious and important advantage is that Hong Kong entities would be entitled to all the tax benefits under Hong Kong law. In the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025 which I mentioned a moment ago, Hong Kong also ranks first in the sub-factor ""Tax policy"". And, of course, Hong Kong corporate vehicles may be conveniently used to raise finance and capital to fund Belt and Road projects in Hong Kong, which is one of the most important international financial centres in the world. There are also other privileges which are only available to Hong Kong enterprises. Let me give you one example: since mid-February this year, Hong Kong enterprises, including companies with some Hong Kong interests irrespective of the extent thereof, in the major cities of the Greater Bay Area in Guangdong Province, now enjoy the option to choose Hong Kong law as the governing law of their contracts with other Mainland enterprises, and to choose Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration for resolving disputes.

  It is indisputable that Hong Kong has an abundant supply of legal professionals who are highly regarded by the international community. With rich experience and strong expertise in international business, commercial, financial and investment law, our legal professionals serve as ""global"" lawyers in the sense that, apart from providing legal services related to Hong Kong law, they are able to advise and provide services on legal issues involving other jurisdictions in the light of their good and extensive connections with other jurisdictions. Currently, 280 law firms in Hong Kong have overseas offices, 85 have representative offices in the Mainland; there are 27 registered associations of firms formed jointly by local and foreign laws, 85 foreign law firms and more than 1 600 foreign lawyers.

Dispute resolution services

  Let me now move on to dispute resolution services. The starting point is that, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", our Judiciary enjoys the independent power of adjudication including that of final adjudication. In our highest court, namely the Court of Final Appeal, apart from local judges, eminent judges from other common law jurisdictions such as the UK (United Kingdom), Australia and New Zealand have been invited to sit as foreign non-permanent judges to ensure that our common law jurisprudence will be of the highest quality and meet the expectations of the international community.

  Turning to other modes of dispute resolution, Hong Kong is well regarded as one of the top international arbitration centres. According to the 2025 International Arbitration Survey conducted by Queen Mary University of London, Hong Kong ranks as the second most preferred seat for arbitration globally and the first in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2024, 76.4 per cent of the arbitrations submitted to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC) were international in nature. B&RI countries and jurisdictions account for the majority of the geographical origins or nationalities of arbitrators appointed, as well as parties participating in HKIAC arbitrations. Our Judiciary is also renowned for its strong pro-arbitration stance.

It is impossible not to mention mediation. The establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) is an important supplement to the current international dispute settlement regime, marking a milestone in promoting the settlement of international disputes, which include disputes between a government and foreign nationals and also international commercial disputes, through mediation. The Signing Ceremony of the Convention on the Establishment of the IOMed was held in Hong Kong on May 30, 2025. Up to date, 36 countries, including China, have signed the Convention, and I believe all of them are B&RI countries. It is noteworthy that the headquarters of the IOMed is situated in Hong Kong; and subject to rules to be made by IOMed, the government and nationals of state parties who have not yet signed or ratified the Convention will also be entitled to use the service of the IOMed.

Capacity building

  We also see capacity building as an important component of international legal collaborations. The Department of Justice (DoJ) established the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy in November 2024. The Academy provides tailor-made training programmes in collaboration with different jurisdictions and international organisations on topics including international law, international arbitration, Hong Kong common law, and so on and so forth.

Collaboration with BR&I countries

  The Hong Kong Government is committed to enhancing legal collaborations with Belt and Road countries and the Mainland to assist in the construction of B&RI. The seventh Hong Kong Legal Services Forum was held in Xi'an, a key strategic city in western China under the B&RI, in May this year, and the theme was about cross-border transactions and foreign investment under the B&RI.

  Memoranda of Understanding on legal co-operation were signed with the Minister of Justice of Saudi Arabia and the Minister of Commerce of Cambodia in April last year and May this year respectively. I am very pleased that, just this morning, my department also signed a Memorandum of Co-operation with the Ministry of Law and Justice of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on strengthening co-operation on dispute avoidance and resolution. This Memorandum is the sixth with jurisdictions along the Belt and Road.

  Furthermore, since I assumed my present position as the Secretary for Justice, I have organised a number of trips leading a delegation consisting of legal professionals from Hong Kong to visit various Belt and Road countries in the Middle East and South East Asia.

  All in all, I firmly believe that Hong Kong will be of great assistance to all friends taking part in Belt and Road projects by providing one-stop legal services covering the whole business cycle of such projects, from inception to fruition. Our international, credible and top-quality legal professionals are ready, willing and able to serve and fight for your best interests.

  Looking ahead, the DoJ will continue to use different means to enhance legal co-operations and collaborations with other jurisdictions along the Belt and Road, and to promote and refine our legal and dispute resolution services to ensure that they will meet the expectations and demands of potential and actual users. On this note, I wish you all a constructive and enjoyable session this afternoon. Thank you."

（一）據悉醫院管理局（醫管局）透過「HA Go」流動應用程式及供醫護人員使用的臨床管理系統提供遙距醫療服務，政府是否知悉，至今醫管局透過該等途徑提供了多少次遙距診症服務，以及涉及的病人數目為何；醫護人員和病人對該等服務的意見反饋分別為何；

（二）是否知悉，過去三年政府及相關公營機構收到多少宗有關遙距醫療服務的投訴，以及該等投訴的內容及跟進情況分別為何；及

（三）鑑於消費者委員會早前公布的一項研究指出，現時消費者透過WhatsApp及Zoom等應用程式接受遙距醫療服務存在私隱風險問題，當局會否考慮加強醫健通或「HA Go」流動應用程式的功能，讓私營醫療服務提供者能夠透過該等平台及應用程式為病人提供遙距醫療服務，以加強對個人資料和健康數據的保護，並促進遙距醫療服務的發展？

答覆：

主席：

遙距醫療是醫療服務，必須由合資格醫護人員提供，並受相關醫護專業的管理局及委員會監管。醫護人員有責任確保通過遙距醫療提供的服務符合規管機構的守則及指引，並切合病人的臨床情況和臨床目標，醫護人員的專業水平絕不應因為服務模式不同而有所妥協。香港醫務委員會的遙距醫療實務道德規範指引清晰指出，醫生需要了解任何遙距醫療應用和電子通訊的局限性，如果技術和環境限制影響遙距醫療服務，以致無法滿足醫生執業的專業標準及謹慎責任，則必須考慮替代方案。

雖然政府鼓勵業界通過創新方式提供醫療服務，非醫護專業人員及企業不應作不實宣傳，甚至提供遙距醫療。政府會審視遙距醫療的廣告有否違反《不良廣告（醫藥）條例》（第231章）的規定，以及其服務有否違反其他法例下無牌執業的規定。

就陳永光議員的提問，現綜合回覆如下：

2019冠狀病毒病疫情期間，香港的遙距醫療服務開始普及，在非常時期作為一個重要的抗疫政策。遙距醫療存在一定局限，例如較難建立醫患關係，亦未必適合需實地接受臨床身體檢查以作出診治的病人。此外，遙距醫療服務亦依賴穩定的技術基礎設施，網絡、設備或其他技術問題都可能會影響服務質量。要求病人具備相關設備，可能會增加時間成本和技術門檻，尤其是一些較年長或不熟悉科技的病人。

因應2019冠狀病毒病疫情的情況，醫院管理局（醫管局）開始發展遙距醫療作為輔助，並一直謹慎處理遙距醫療的局限。一般而言，遙距醫療較適用於慢性病患而病情穩定、並非新症以及無須親臨醫院接受醫生臨床檢查的病人。醫管局會視乎病人的臨床情況穩定性、臨床需要及實際運作情況以安排遙距診症的醫療服務。由二○二二年四月至二○二五年三月的三年期間，參與遙距醫療的非新冠個案超過34萬宗，包括社區老人評估小組為安老院舍長者提供的遙距診症、專職醫療（如臨床心理學家服務）和專科門診服務。藥劑部亦會透過遙距方法提供用藥指導服務。

醫管局的遙距醫療服務自推展以來運作大致順暢，病人反應正面，普遍認為流程簡單易用，尤其是為居住在偏遠地區或行動不便的病人帶來方便。過去三年，醫管局共收到兩宗有關遙距醫療服務的投訴，主要涉及未能使病人清晰了解服務流程，例如預約及領取藥物和轉介信的安排。醫管局已隨即向有關病人詳細解釋及跟進情況。醫管局會繼續定期檢討遙距診症的應用效果，令服務更切合病人需要和符合成本效益。

醫管局的「HA Go」流動應用程式目標是協助病人管理其在公立醫院及診所的服務，並不適合供私營醫療服務提供者或其他病人使用。另一方面，政府現正推展「醫健通+」五年計劃，將醫健通提升為一個集合數據互通、服務提供以及流程管理於一身的綜合醫療資訊基建，以更有效地支援各項醫療政策。在考慮「醫健通+」的發展時，我們須審慎衡量相關功能的適切性、所需公共資源運用的效益、資料私隱和系統保安措施等相關因素。

政府會繼續密切留意遙距醫療服務在香港的推展及普及情況，與業界及相關持份者共同探討遙距醫療在合適的服務，例如外展服務和護士診所、專職醫療服務等基層醫療服務方面的進一步發展。政府並將確保各個醫護專業的管理局及委員會按照行業特色和實務需要，訂出並適時修訂遙距醫療的具體指引，以期保障病人和醫護人員的權益。

多謝主席。"
LCQ6: Development of telemedicine services,2025-09-10 16:25,2025-09-10 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000551.htm,"  Following is a question by Professor the Hon Chan Wing-kwong and a reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  Regarding the development of telemedicine services, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is learnt that the Hospital Authority (HA) provides telemedicine services through the ""HA Go"" mobile application and the clinical management system used by healthcare professionals, whether the Government knows the number of tele-consultation services provided by the HA through these channels to date, the number of patients involved as well as the respective feedback from healthcare professionals and patients on these services;

(2) whether it knows the number of complaints concerning telemedicine services received by the Government and relevant public organisations in the past three years, and the content and follow-up situations respectively of those complaints; and

(3) as a study released earlier on by the Consumer Council has pointed out the privacy risks involved when consumers receive telemedicine services through applications such as WhatsApp and Zoom nowadays, whether the authorities will consider strengthening the functionality of eHealth or ""HA Go"" mobile applications, so that private healthcare service providers can provide telemedicine services to patients through these platforms and applications, so as to enhance the protection of personal information and health data, and promote the development of telemedicine services?

Reply:

President,

  Telehealth is a type of medical service that should be provided by qualified healthcare professionals and governed by the regulatory boards and councils of relevant healthcare professions. Healthcare professionals have the responsibility to ensure services provided through telehealth comply with the codes and guidelines promulgated by regulatory authorities, are suited for the clinical setting and objective of patients, and must not compromise the professional standard because of service modes. The Medical Council of Hong Kong's Ethical Guidelines on Practice of Telemedicine stipulates clearly that doctors need to be aware of the limits of any telehealth applications and electronic communications, and alternatives must be considered if technical and environmental limitations affect telehealth services as to compromising the professional standard and duty of care of medical practices.

  While the Government encourages professions to provide medical services by innovative means, non-healthcare professionals and companies must not untruthfully promote or even provide telehealth. The Government will scrutinise advertisement on telehealth to ascertain whether there are violation of the Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance (Cap. 231) and whether the services so provided have violated regulations under other legislations concerning practising without a licence.

  In response to the questions raised by Professor the Hon Chan Wing-kwong, my consolidated reply is as follows:

  During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth services became prevalent in Hong Kong, being an important anti-epidemic strategy during the critical period. Telehealth has certain limitations, for instance, the establishment of a doctor-patient relationship may prove challenging, and such services may not be suitable for patients requiring in-person clinical examinations for diagnosis. Furthermore, telehealth services rely on stable technological infrastructure. Issues such as network stability, equipment, or other technical problems may affect service quality. Requiring patients to possess related equipment may increase time costs and technological threshold, particularly for elderly patients or those not familiar with technology.

  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hospital Authority (HA) has started to develop telehealth as a complementary measure, and has been managing the limitations of telehealth cautiously. Generally speaking, telehealth services are more suitable for chronic patients who are clinically stable, not new cases as well as those who do not need to visit hospitals to undergo clinical examinations by doctors. The HA will arrange medical services through telehealth, having taken into account the stability of the clinical conditions of patients, their clinical needs, and actual operational situations. During the three years from April 2022 to March 2025, telehealth was involved in more than 340000 non-COVID-19 cases, including tele-consultations provided by the Community Geriatric Assessment Teams for elderly living in residential care homes for the elderly, allied health (e.g. clinical psychology service) and specialist out-patient services. The pharmacies also provide drug counselling services through remote means.

  The HA's telehealth services have been operating smoothly since inception, with positive feedback from patients who generally consider the workflow simple and user-friendly, and particularly convenient for patients residing in remote areas or with mobility difficulties. Over the past three years, the HA received two complaints regarding telehealth services that mainly involved patients not being clearly informed about the service workflow, such as arrangements regarding booking appointments, drug collection and referral letters. The HA had promptly provided detailed explanations and followed up with the patients concerned. The HA will continue to regularly review the impact after the application of telehealth to ensure the services can better meet patients' needs while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

  The HA's ""HA Go"" app is designed to assist its patients in managing their services in public hospitals and clinics, and is not suitable for use by private healthcare providers or other patients. On the other hand, the Government is implementing the ""eHealth+"" five-year development plan to upgrade eHealth into a comprehensive healthcare information infrastructure that integrates data sharing, service delivery and process management, with a view to supporting various healthcare policies more effectively. In considering the development of ""eHealth+"", we have to carefully assess the relevant factors, such as the appropriateness of the relevant functions, the effective use of public resources, data privacy and system security.

  The Government will continue to closely monitor the development and adoption of telehealth services in Hong Kong, and will work with the sector and relevant stakeholders to explore the further development of telehealth in suitable services, such as outreach services and primary healthcare services including nurse clinics and allied health services, etc. The Government will also ensure boards and councils of various healthcare professions would promulgate and review specific guidelines on telehealth in a timely manner based on professional practice and operational needs, with a view to protecting the interests of patients and healthcare professionals.

  Thank you, President."

問題：

近日香港天文台發出數次黑色暴雨警告信號。據悉連場暴雨令不少鄉郊地區，包括大嶼山嶼南道、鹹田舊村和鹹田新村（鹹田村）、十塱舊村和十塱新村（十塱村）及南丫島榕樹灣等地出現嚴重水浸。在連場黑雨過後本人曾到訪較多長者居住的鹹田村和十塱村視察。當地村民反映每次暴雨發生時均出現水浸入屋的情況，令他們的電器和電線全部浸濕，存在危險，惟村民致電相關政府部門求助時未獲即時處理，令他們損失慘重並感到徬徨。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年當局接獲多少宗大嶼山南區鄉村的水浸報告；該等個案發生水浸的主要成因為何；每宗個案所需的處理時間及結果分別為何；

（二）針對上述村民反映每逢暴雨發生時出現水浸入屋和電線及電器受損的情況，政府會採取哪些即時或長遠的解決措施；

（三）有否定期（例如每年或每季度）檢查及清理上述地區的排水渠道，以確保排水系統暢通；如有，在檢查中發現排水渠道淤塞的情況，以及相關檢查和清理的次數分別為何；及

（四）面對極端天氣日益頻繁，政府有何措施協助上述地區的村民（尤其是長者），提升應對暴雨及水浸的能力；未來會否加強在暴雨及水浸下對他們的支援（例如設立專屬熱線或應變小組）？

答覆：

主席：

面對極端天氣，政府在超前準備、加強預警、果斷應急、迅速復原的策略框架下，制定具前瞻性的「綜合防洪管理策略」，以應對氣候變化的影響。此策略致力結合適應、應變及管理的措施，以提升本港整體的防洪能力。針對鄉郊地區的情況，除了推動地區排水系統改善工程外，政府亦持續加強相關的防洪管理工作，以提升其防洪能力。

就劉業強議員提問的各部分，現回覆如下：

（一）過去五年多（即二○二○年至二○二五年八月），渠務署在大嶼山南區共確認七宗水浸個案，詳情如下：

根據調查結果，以上水浸個案主要是由於暴雨期間，大量枯葉及雜物被沖至位處於低窪的路邊集水溝、進水口及排水道，並造成阻塞，令雨水難以進入下游的雨水收集及排放系統，引致水浸情況。上述水浸個案均於一至兩小時內完成處理及清除積水。

（二）至（四）渠務署會定期為公共雨水排放系統進行巡查、清理及維修保養。以大嶼山南區為例，今年截至八月，署方已為公共雨水排放系統完成28次巡查及渠道清理工作。

渠務署與天文台緊密聯繫，當預測暴雨即將來臨時，渠務署會實施「及時清渠」安排，調配人手巡查容易受枯葉及雜物等阻塞的位置，並清理淤塞的渠道，以減低大雨期間的水浸風險。此外，每當天文台發出紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號、新界北部水浸特別報告、八號或以上熱帶氣旋警告信號，渠務署便會即時啓動緊急事故控制中心，並派遣緊急應變隊伍處理市民求助個案，清理水浸情況。

現時，全港約有240個渠道容易淤塞點，當中多於一半位於新界及離島地區，包括四個位於大嶼山南區。為進一步強化緊急事故控制中心在極端天氣情況下的應變能力，渠務署已增加緊急應變隊伍的數目，由去年160隊擴展至今年180隊，以及設立超過30個分布全港各區的應急運作基地，當中位處梅窩的應急運作基地能迅速派遣緊急應變隊伍到大嶼山南區（包括鹹田村或十塱村等地）應對水浸事件。

每當暴雨過後，渠務署均會檢視每個水浸個案的成因，並與相關部門探討並按需要進行合適的排水系統改善工程以緩減水浸風險。因應最近暴雨引致的水浸事故，政府正計劃在鹹田村和十塱村進行排水設施改善工程，例如加設排水管道，以及為居民安裝擋水裝置提供技術支援。

渠務署為市民應對水浸事件推行多項支援措施，包括設立24小時電話熱線（2300 1110），以便更有效直接接收水浸個案報告，讓渠務署可快速處理。另外，各相關政府部門，例如民政事務總署、路政署及食物環境衞生署亦會定期巡查及清理相關的雨水排放設施。渠務署會與各相關部門保持緊密聯繫，確保公共雨水排放系統正常運作。渠務署亦會繼續與地區人士保持溝通及聽取居民的意見，以進一步減低有關地區的水浸風險。"
LCQ21: Handling of flooding in Islands District,2025-09-10 15:47,2025-09-10 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000522.htm,"ââFollowing is a question by the Hon Kenneth Lau and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

 The Hong Kong Observatory has recently issued the Black Rainstorm Signal on multiple occasions. It is learnt that consecutive rainstorms have caused serious flooding in a number of rural areas, including South Lantau Road on Lantau Island, Ham Tin Kau Tsuen and Ham Tin San Tsuen (Ham Tin Tsuen), Shap Long Kau Tsuen and Shap Long San Tsuen (Shap Long Tsuen), and Yung Shue Wan on Lamma Island. After the consecutive black rainstorms, I have visited Ham Tin Tsuen and Shap Long Tsuen, where a relatively large number of elderly persons reside. Local villagers have relayed that flooding into houses occurred during every rainstorm, causing all their electrical appliances and wiring to be soaked and posing dangers; however, when villagers telephoned the relevant government departments for assistance, no immediate handling was provided, resulting in heavy losses on their part and leaving them at a loss. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the numbers of flooding reports from villages in South Lantau received by the authorities in each of the past five years; the main causes for the occurrence of flooding in such cases; the handling time required and outcome for each case respectively;

(2) regarding the situation of flooding into houses and damage to wiring and electrical appliances occur during every rainstorm relayed by the aforesaid villagers, of the immediate or long-term remedial measures that the Government will adopt;

(3) whether it has regularly (for example, annually or quarterly) inspected and cleared the drainage channels in the aforesaid areas to ensure proper functioning of the drainage systems; if so, of the situation of blockage of drainage channels found during the inspections, as well as the respective numbers of relevant inspections and clearances; and

(4) in the face of increasingly frequent extreme weather events, of the measures in place to assist villagers in the aforesaid areas (especially elderly persons) to enhance their capabilities in coping with rainstorms and flooding; whether it will strengthen the support for them under rainstorms and flooding in future (for example, setting up a dedicated hotline or a response team)?

Reply:

President,

 In coping with extreme weather, the Government has developed a forward-looking Integrated Flood Management Strategy under a framework of advanced emergency preparedness, enhanced early warning, decisive emergency response and speedy recovery, to combat the impacts brought by climate change. This strategy aims to integrate adaptation, response, and management to enhance the overall flood resilience of Hong Kong. Regarding the situation in rural areas, in addition to carrying out improvement works to local drainage systems, the Government is also continuously strengthening related flood management work to enhance the flood protection abilities.

 My respective replies to the various parts of the Hon KennethLau's question are as follows:

(1) Over the past five years (from 2020 to August 2025), the Drainage Services Department (DSD) has confirmed seven flooding cases in South Lantau. The details are as follows:




Year
No. of Confirmed Flooding Case


2025 (up to August)

 According to the investigation results, the aforementioned flooding cases were primarily caused by heavy rainfall, during which a large amount of fallen leaves and debris were washed into low-lying roadside gullies, intakes, and drainage channels, leading to blockages. This hindered the natural flow of rainwater into the downstream stormwater collection and drainage systems, leading to flooding. All of these flooding cases were handled and resolved within one to two hours.

(2) to (4) The DSD conducts regular inspections, cleansing, and maintenance of public stormwater drainage systems. For example in South Lantau, the department has completed 28 inspections and cleansing operations for the public stormwater drainage system as of August this year.

 The DSD maintains close collaboration with the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). Before the onset of a heavy rainstorm, the department implements a ""just-in-time clearance"" arrangement. Manpower will be deployed to inspect and clear drains that are prone to blockages caused by fallen leaves and debris, so as to reduce the risk of flooding during heavy rain. Additionally, when the HKO issues a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal, a Special Announcement on Flooding in the northern New Territories or a Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal of number 8 or above, the DSD will immediately activate its Emergency Control Centre and deploy emergency response teams to address public requests for assistance and handle flooding cases.

 Currently, there are approximately 240 drainage points in Hong Kong that are prone to blockage, more than half of which are located in the New Territories and Islands, including four in South Lantau. To further enhance the response capabilities of Emergency Control Centre during extreme weather conditions, the DSD has increased the number of emergency response teams from 160 last year to 180 this year. Additionally, over 30 emergency operation stations across the territories have been established. The emergency operation station at Mui Wo can quickly deploy emergency response teams to South Lantau, including areas such as Ham Tin Village and Shap Long Village to tackle flooding incidents.

 Following every heavy rainstorm, the DSD reviews the causes of each flooding case and collaborates with relevant departments to discuss and implement necessary drainage improvement works, aimed at mitigating flood risks. In response to recent flooding incidents caused by heavy rain, the Government plans to carry out drainage improvement works in Ham Tin Village and Shap Long Village, such as installing additional drainage pipes and providing technical support for residents to install flood barriers.

 The DSD has implemented several support measures to help the public to cope with flooding incidents. These include establishing a 24-hour hotline (2300 1110) to efficiently receive and swiftly handling flooding reports. In addition, relevant government departments, such as the Home Affairs Department, the Highways Department, and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, conduct regular inspections and cleansing of related stormwater drainage facilities. The DSD maintains close liaison with these departments to ensure the proper functioning of the public stormwater drainage system. The DSD will continue to liaise with the local community and gather feedback from citizens with a view to further reducing the flooding risks in the affected areas."

問題：

據悉政府近年積極推動市區更新，以「復修為先」的策略取代大規模重建，藉此改善樓宇結構安全，以延長樓宇壽命。本人近日接獲市民反映，即使樓宇已完成復修工程並符合安全標準，令其使用年期得以延長，但銀行在審批按揭時仍採用「75減樓齡」的計算方法（即樓齡逾55年的住宅物業只能獲批最長20年的按揭年期），這不但加重了市民在首期及每月按揭供款的負擔，也減低舊樓的流通性。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據悉政府大力推動樓宇復修以取代重建，當局有否與香港金融管理局商討，適度調高已完成復修並通過安全檢驗的樓宇的按揭年期；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）政府會否考慮為已完成訂明檢驗及訂明修葺的樓宇設立認證機制，讓銀行在審批該等樓宇的按揭時可考慮延長按揭年期；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）有否統計現時樓齡50年或以上的住宅物業的以下資料：（i）整體數量、（ii）當中持有按揭的住戶數目，以及（iii）其每月按揭供款及借貸還款的中位數；如沒有統計，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就問題的三個部分，經諮詢發展局及香港金融管理局（金管局）後，現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）政府的樓宇更新策略是復修和重建並重。屋宇署每年會按風險揀選約600幢樓齡達30年或以上的私人樓宇（註一）發出強制驗樓法定通知（驗樓通知），着令業主為大廈的公用部分及個別單位的伸出物進行檢驗及修葺。至今獲發出驗樓通知的8 364幢樓宇，約百分之七十為樓齡50年或以上。妥善保養物業是業主責任，不但可保障住戶、建築物及公眾安全，也可延長樓宇的壽命，對維持物業價值有正面作用。

如業主完成驗樓通知的要求，屋宇署會向業主發信確認通知已獲遵辦。此外，公眾可透過屋宇署網站，查閱個別私人樓宇是否獲發法定通知，以及其遵辦情況。如業主沒有收到法定通知而自願按照強制驗樓計劃的要求完成檢驗及修葺，屋宇署亦會向相關業主發出證明信件。

金管局沒有就按揭物業的樓齡設立按揭年限。銀行的貸款審批是其自身商業決定，銀行在審批按揭申請時會考慮一籃子因素，包括借款人還款能力和樓宇狀況，當中物業的樓齡只是其中一個考慮因素。在考慮是否審批住宅按揭申請時，上述由屋宇署發出有關樓宇完成檢驗及修葺的資料相信會有助銀行評估樓宇狀況。

LCQ17: Mortgage terms for aged buildings,2025-09-10 15:30,2025-09-10 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000373.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Wendy Hong and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  It is learnt that in recent years, the Government has actively promoted urban renewal, replacing large-scale redevelopment with a ""rehabilitation first"" strategy to improve building structural safety and prolong their lifespan. Members of the public have recently relayed to me that, even when rehabilitation works have been completed for the buildings and safety standards met to prolong their service life, banks still adopt the ""75 minus building age"" calculation method (i.e. residential properties over 55 years old can only be granted a maximum mortgage term of 20 years) when assessing mortgage applications. This not only adds to the burden of down payments and monthly mortgage payments on members of the public, but also reduces the liquidity of old buildings. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is learnt that the Government is vigorously promoting building rehabilitation as an alternative to redevelopment, whether the authorities have discussed with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority the possibility of appropriately extending the mortgage term for buildings that have completed rehabilitation and passed safety inspections; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether the Government will consider establishing a certification mechanism for buildings that have completed prescribed inspections and prescribed repairs, so that banks may consider extending the mortgage term when approving mortgages for such buildings; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it has compiled statistics on the following information of residential properties currently aged 50 years or above: (i) the total number, (ii) the number of households having mortgages among them, and (iii) their median monthly mortgage payments and loan repayments; if it has not compiled statistics, of the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  After consulting the Development Bureau and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), our reply to the three parts of the question is as follows:

(1) & (2) The Government's strategy for building renewal emphasises both rehabilitation and redevelopment. The Buildings Department (BD) annually selects about 600 private buildings (Note 1) aged 30 years or above on a risk basis and the owners of such building served with statutory mandatory building inspection notices (MBI notices) are required to carry out inspections and repairs for the common parts of their buildings and the projections of the individual units. Among the 8 364 buildings served with MBI notices so far, about 70 per cent of them aged 50 years or above. Proper maintenance and repair of properties are owners' primary responsibility. It not only protects the safety of residents, buildings and the public, but also extends the buildings' lifespan, which has a positive impact on the property values.

  If the owners have complied with the requirements of the MBI notices, the BD will issue compliance letters to the owners. Besides, the public can enquire and view the service and compliance status of the statutory notices of the private buildings via the BD's website. Where owners have voluntarily arranged and carried out building inspection and repair in accordance with the requirements and procedures under the Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme, the BD will also issue acknowledgement letters to the owners.

  The HKMA does not set a specific mortgage term limit based on the age of a property. The approval of loans is a commercial decision made by banks. When processing mortgage applications, banks take into account a host of factors, including the borrower's repayment capacity and the condition of the building. The age of the property is only one of the factors of consideration. When considering whether to approve mortgage applications for a residential property, the abovementioned information issued by the BD regarding the completion of inspection and repair of the building may assist banks in evaluating the condition of the building.

(3) According to the BD's record, as at the end of 2024, there were 8 977 private residential buildings aged 50 years or above (excluding New Territories Exempted Houses). As regards whether the units in those private residential buildings have a mortgage and the specific details about the mortgage loan payments and repayments, they are agreements reached between the property owners and the banks. The Government does not maintain relevant commercial data for statistical purposes.

Note 1: Except domestic buildings not exceeding three storeys."
立法會十九題：支援建造業界人才,2025-09-10 15:15,2025-09-10 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000498.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上謝偉銓議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

在本人與業界爭取下，政府於二○二○年推出資助計劃（二○二○年計劃），鼓勵和支持私人機構聘用工程、建築、測量、都市規劃及園境界別的畢業生和助理專業人員，讓他們取得所需工作經驗以獲取專業資格，紓緩新冠疫情對業界的衝擊。由於疫情持續影響就業市場，發展局於二○二一年再度推出「支援工程、建築、測量、都市規劃及園境界2.0」的措施（二○二一年計劃），協助業界渡過困境和減少人才流失。因應近期建造業不景氣的情況，政府在本年度《財政預算案》宣布，由建造業議會出資約1.5億元，資助建造業界為合共約2 500名工程、建築、測量、都市規劃及園境界的學位課程畢業生提供在職培訓（二○二五年計劃），向每名合資格／獲批核的青年專才提供每月5,000元的津貼，為期12個月。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）二○二○年計劃及二○二一年計劃的以下資料：（i）申請資助名額數目、（ii）獲批的資助名額數目、（iii）實際獲發放薪金津貼的僱員人數，以及（iv）最終發放的薪金津貼總額，並按專業界別列出分項數字；

（二）二○二五年計劃的以下資料：（i）申請資助名額數目，以及（ii）獲批的資助名額數目，並按專業界別列出分項數字；

（三）鑑於有業界人士反映，建造業不景氣的情況嚴峻，預計不少公司都未能增聘畢業生，政府及建造業議會會否因應實際情況及在無須增撥資源的情況下，適度調高二○二五年計劃的每月津貼金額，以加強鼓勵業界聘用更多畢業生；及

（四）鑑於有意見認為，估計建造業不景氣的情況將持續一段時間，加上未來大型發展（包括北部都會區等）需要大量相關專業人才，政府會否考慮增撥資助和延長有關資助計劃？

答覆：

主席：

發展局聯同建造業議會一直密切留意建造業界的情況，在業界有需要時推出適切的計劃，包括題述於二○二○年及二○二一年疫情時透過「防疫抗疫基金」推出的資助計劃（即二○二○年計劃及二○二一年計劃），以及今年透過建造業議會撥款1.5億元推出的「建造業專業學位課程畢業生在職培訓津貼計劃」（二○二五年計劃），支援業界渡過難關，並為行業培育及挽留人才。

計及上述兩項計劃，建造業議會總共撥款1.74億元，資助建造業界為合共2 900名畢業生提供在職培訓。

（四）建造業界普遍歡迎及支持上述兩項二○二五年推出的資助計劃，認同對行業現時的情況有所幫助。發展局聯同建造業議會會繼續與業界保持緊密溝通，檢視計劃的執行狀況及業界整體情況、不同持分者的需要，以及議會未來數年的財政預算，考慮計劃的未來安排。"
LCQ19: Support for construction industry talents,2025-09-10 15:15,2025-09-10 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000504.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Tony Tse and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

With the endeavours made by me and the industry, the Government launched a subsidy scheme in 2020 (2020 Scheme) as a means of encouraging and supporting private organisations to employ graduates and assistant professionals of the engineering, architectural, surveying, town planning and landscape (EASTL) sectors, so as to enable them to acquire necessary work experience in order to obtain professional qualifications and to alleviate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry. As the impacts of the pandemic on the job market remained, the Development Bureau further launched in 2021 an initiative called Support for Engineering, Architectural, Surveying, Town Planning and Landscape Sectors 2.0 (2021 Scheme) to assist the industry in tiding over the difficult times and reducing its manpower drain. In view of the recent downturn in the construction industry, the Government announced in the Budget of this year that the Construction Industry Council (CIC) would allocate around $150 million to subsidise the construction industry to provide on-the-job training for about 2 500 graduates of the EASTL degree programmes (2025 Scheme) and provide a monthly subsidy of $5,000 to each eligible/approved young talent for a period of 12 months. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following details about the 2020 Scheme and the 2021 Scheme: (i) the number of applications for subsidy places, (ii) the number of approved subsidy places, (iii) the number of employees to whom salary subsidies were actually disbursed, and (iv) the total amount of salary subsidies eventually disbursed, with a breakdown by professional sector;

(2) of the following details about the 2025 Scheme: (i) the number of applications for subsidy places, and (ii) the number of approved subsidy places, with a breakdown by professional sector;

(3) as some members of the industry have expressed that with the severe downturn in the construction industry, it is expected that many companies will be unable to increase their employment of graduates, whether the Government and the CIC will take account of the actual circumstances and, without the need for additional resources, appropriately increase the monthly subsidy amount under the 2025 Scheme, so as to enhance the industry's motivation to employ more graduates; and

(4) as there are views suggesting that the downturn in the construction industry is expected to persist for quite some time, and massive development projects (including the Northern Metropolis) will require a substantial amount of related professional talents in the future, whether the Government will consider the provision of additional subsidies and an extension of the relevant subsidy scheme?

Reply:

President,

The Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Construction Industry Council (CIC) have been closely monitoring the situation of the construction industry. We have introduced suitable schemes, including the funding schemes mentioned in the subject question launched under the Anti-epidemic Fund during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 (i.e. 2020 Scheme and 2021 Scheme), and the Construction Industry Professional Degree Graduate On-the-Job Training Subsidy Scheme (2025 Scheme) launched through the CIC's allocation of $150 million this year, to support the industry in overcoming prevailing difficulties and to nurture and retain talent for the industry.

In response to the various parts of the LegCo question, the DEVB's corresponding replies are as follows:

(1) The details of the 2020 Scheme are as follows:




Professional discipline
Number of applications for subsidy places
Number of approved subsidy places
Number of employees to whom salary subsidies were disbursed
Total subsidy disbursed

(3) As all the 2 500 quotas under the 2025 Scheme have already been allocated, thereby using up all its allocation of $150 million, the CIC is unable to further increase the monthly subsidy amount.

Furthermore, with the support of the DEVB, the CIC allocated an additional $24 million in March 2025 to subsidise the construction industry to provide on-the-job training for 400 higher diploma graduates in engineering, architecture, surveying, town planning, and landscape architecture. Successful applicants for this funding scheme will receive a monthly subsidy of $5,000 for each approved higher diploma graduate for a period of 12 months, amounting to $60,000 in total. The application period for this scheme was the same as the aforementioned 2025 Scheme. The CIC has already completed the application processing and notified all successful applicants in May 2025.

For the above two schemes, the CIC has allocated a total of $174 million to subsidise the construction industry to provide on-the-job training for a total of 2 900 graduates.

(4) The construction industry generally welcomed and supported the above two subsidy schemes launched in 2025, acknowledging that they are helpful to the current situation of the industry. The DEVB, in collaboration with the CIC, will continue to maintain close communication with the industry, to keep in view the implementation of the schemes, the overall situation of the industry, the needs of different stakeholders and the CIC's budget for the coming years, and to consider the future arrangement for the schemes."
LCQ13: Promoting development of yacht industry,2025-09-10 15:01,2025-09-10 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000402.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Benson Luk and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

In the second quarter of this year, the Guangdong Maritime Safety Administration issued the Implementation Plan for the Free Flow of Yachts among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao (Draft for Comments) (the Plan) with the aim of promoting the synergistic development of the yacht industry in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and facilitating the flow of yachts in the GBA. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the SAR Government has plans to formulate measures to dovetail with the proposals for the free flow of yachts in the Plan, so as to expedite the promotion of the yacht industry's development in Hong Kong; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it has plans to permit non-Hong Kong yachts to enter and exit Hong Kong waters for multiple times within a specified period upon entering Hong Kong without having to undergo port formalities again, and to hold discussions with the Government of Guangdong Province on streamlining the immigration arrangements for yachts, so that non-Hong Kong yachts with the permission to enter Hong Kong waters may also sail to other Mainland cities in the GBA; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) whether it has plans to streamline the existing immigration and customs clearance procedures for yacht crew and passengers entering and exiting Hong Kong, such as streamlining the existing requirement that yacht masters or their agents must undergo formalities such as immigration inspection and customs declaration at different locations; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) given that under the law, non-Hong Kong yachts must obtain the permission of the Director of Marine in order to navigate in Hong Kong waters, whether the authorities have plans to streamline the vetting and approval procedures for such vessels to navigate in Hong Kong waters; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) of the ways to motivate enterprises to organise more yacht exhibitions and sales fairs in Hong Kong, and to attract more overseas and Mainland yacht builders and manufacturers of yacht accessories to establish branch offices in Hong Kong, so as to promote the development of the yacht industry?

Reply:

President,

In response to the inquiry raised by the Hon Benson Luk, after consulting the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), the Security Bureau, the Development Bureau, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the Marine Department (MD), the reply is as follows:

(1) The CSTB supports the development and co-operation of yacht tourism in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, with a view to expanding and promoting high value-added tourism activities in Hong Kong and demonstrating the role of Hong Kong as a core demonstration zone for multi-destination tourism. The MD and the Guangdong Maritime Safety Administration have established a dedicated task force to maintain discussion and co-operation on various issues relating to facilitation of yacht travelling, including the ""yacht free travel"" proposal put forward by Guangdong Province, and to jointly formulate relevant implementation measures.

(2) and (3) At present, visiting yachts (including those from the Mainland) entering Hong Kong waters are required to complete port formalities with the MD, the Immigration Department (ImmD), the Department of Health (DH) and the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department. Generally speaking, local agents would be appointed to handle all the port formalities in Hong Kong for visiting yachts. The MD has set up an electronic business system to provide one-stop service for visiting yachts, allowing them to submit the required documents to the MD, the ImmD and the DH through the online system in an efficient and convenient manner. At the same time, visiting yachts are currently not required to be anchored at an approved immigration anchorage whilst awaiting immigration clearance. The master of a visiting yacht, or its agent, is only required to complete the immigration procedures at the Harbour Control Section of the ImmD (which operates 24 hours every day) located at the Central Government Pier within 24 hours after entering into Hong Kong waters and before the intended departure from the Hong Kong waters. The aforementioned arrangements, which is not applicable to other visiting vessels, aim at simplifying and facilitating the immigration procedures for visiting yachts.

Relevant bureaux and departments will continue to review and improve the relevant arrangements, with a view to facilitating the formulation of a more holistic yacht industrial policy in the future.

(4) In accordance with international practice, foreign yachts must complete port formalities and obtain permission from local government authorities before navigating in local waters. Hong Kong is no exception.

Currently, visiting yachts wishing to navigate freely in Hong Kong waters must submit proof of securing a berth at a private yacht club or marina when applying for entry. Additionally, the yacht's crew members must not only meet the requirements of their country of registry but also pass a local port knowledge examination. The purpose of this examination is to ensure that crew members of visiting yachts are familiar with local fairways, anchorages, speed restriction zones, ferry routes, navigation aids, and other relevant information, thereby ensuring the safe navigation of the yacht within Hong Kong waters and the safety of other port users.

  The MD is exploring whether there is scope to relax requirements or introduce facilitation measures to enhance the navigation experience for visiting yachts in Hong Kong waters.

(5) The Transport and Logistics Bureau is pleased to collaborate with relevant departments and organisations to provide advice to the industry on the development of yacht exhibitions and sales. For example, over the past year, the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) has from time to time hosted large-scale events to brief the business community on the Airport City development blueprint Skytopia, which includes a yacht bay development offering over 500 berths. The AAHK has also participated in overseas yacht exhibitions and conferences, etc."

（五）如何推動企業在香港舉行更多遊艇展覽及銷售會，以及吸引更多海外及內地遊艇承建商、遊艇用品製造商來港設立分公司，以推動遊艇產業的發展？

答覆:

主席:

就陸瀚民議員的提問，經諮詢文化體育及旅遊局、保安局、發展局、商務及經濟發展局和海事處後，現答覆如下：

（一）文化體育及旅遊局支持粵港澳大灣區遊艇旅遊的發展和合作，以拓展和促進香港高增值旅遊活動，發揮香港「一程多站」示範核心區的角色。海事處與廣東海事局已成立專項工作組，就便利遊艇出行的各項議題（包括廣東省提出的遊艇自由行方案）保持磋商與合作，共同制訂相關實施措施。

（二）和（三）現時訪港遊樂船隻（包括內地遊艇）若要進入香港水域，須向海事處、入境事務處、衞生署和香港海關辦妥關務手續。一般而言，訪港遊樂船隻會委託香港本地代理辦理在港的關務手續。海事處設有電子業務系統，為訪港遊樂船隻提供一站式服務，讓他們省時便捷地透過網上系統向海事處、入境事務處和衞生署遞交所需文件。與此同時，現時訪港遊樂船隻無須碇泊於入境船隻認可碇泊處等候出入境檢查。船長或其代表只需在船隻進入香港水域後的24小時內，和預備離開香港水域的24小時前，前往24小時運作位於中區政府碼頭的入境事務處港口管制組辦理出入境手續。上述安排有別於其他訪港船隻，旨在簡化及便利遊樂船隻辦理出入境檢查的手續。

相關政策局和部門會持續檢視及完善有關安排，以在未來制訂更整全的遊艇產業政策。

（四）按國際慣例，外地遊艇均必須辦理關務手續，並獲當地政府部門許可，方可在當地水域航行，香港也不例外。

目前，訪港遊艇如欲在香港水域自由航行，須在辦理遊艇到港申請時提交證明文件，證實其已在私人遊艇會或碼頭取得泊位。另外，該遊艇操作人員的資歷除符合船旗國的要求外，亦須要通過本地港口知識考試，其目的是讓訪港遊艇的操作人員掌握本地的航道、錨地、航速限制區、渡輪航線、航標等知識，以確保該遊艇於香港水域內安全航行，並保障其他港口使用者的安全。

海事處正探討是否有空間放寬要求或探索安排便利措施，以便利訪港遊艇在香港水域航行。

（五）運輸及物流局樂意聯同各相關部門和機構，就遊艇展覽及銷售等方面的發展向業界提供意見。舉例來說，香港機場管理局（機管局）過去一年不時舉辦大型活動，向商界介紹機場城市發展藍圖「Skytopia」，當中包括發展提供逾500個遊艇泊位的遊艇港灣；機管局亦有參與海外遊艇展覽會議等。"

As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without the prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), three removal orders were served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (September 10), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without a reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

Mr Fred Ma (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Mr Frederick Ma), Mr Chen Liang (Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Management Committee of the China International Capital Corporation Limited), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. Welcome to the keynote luncheon of the 10th Belt and Road Summit.

I am pleased that distinguished speakers have been lined up for this luncheon. Allow me to serve as your appetiser, by sharing briefly how Hong Kong is fostering more partnerships and contributing to regional connectivity through leveraging on two important global trends of our time: green and sustainable development, and digital innovation.

The case for green

In the face of rising unilateralism and the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement by a leading economy, Hong Kong remains steadfast in our commitment to climate action. We are on track to reduce our carbon emissions by half by 2035, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This commitment is underpinned by four key strategies: decarbonising power generation, enhancing energy efficiency in buildings, promoting green transport and reducing waste.

But our ambition extends well beyond meeting domestic targets. Two years ago, in my Budget Speech, I set out a vision for Hong Kong to become an international centre for green technology and green finance. We firmly believe that Hong Kong can play a pivotal role in driving global green transition.

Let me begin with green finance, where Hong Kong is already a regional leader. According to market estimates, emerging and developing Asia requires an annual investment of at least US$1.1 trillion for climate mitigation and adaptation. Yet, current investment levels fall short by over 70 per cent, at about US$800 billion. Clearly, we need to mobilise capital more effectively for sustainable investments.

In 2024, sustainable debt issuances in Hong Kong exceeded US$80 billion, with green bonds accounting for around 45 per cent of the region’s total. In the first half of 2025, we saw a 15 per cent year-on-year increase, at over US$34 billion. On ESG (environmental, social and governance), over 200 funds have been authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission, with AUM (asset under management) exceeding US$140 billion, up more than 30 per cent in just three years. The liquidity and expertise in Hong Kong are deep, and the capacity is huge.

Distinguished guests, our platform is fully open to issuers not just from the Chinese Mainland but also from around the world. Sovereign entities, corporates, financial institutions, multilateral organisations are all welcome. Hong Kong stands ready to collaborate with regional and global partners to scale up sustainable finance and channel capital to where it is needed most.

We are also making good progress in transition finance, which plays a vital role in helping high-emission industries decarbonise. On this, a key enabler is the development of clear and robust classification, reporting and disclosure standards.

To this end, we are working to expand the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance to incorporate transition finance, broaden sectoral coverage, and include climate adaptation activities. These enhancements aim to better guide capital flows toward credible climate initiatives and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

As an international financial centre, Hong Kong is deploying innovative financial instruments to address the diverse financing needs of emerging economies. Catastrophe (cat) bonds, for example, are valuable risk-transfer instruments for countries vulnerable to natural disasters. Since 2021, seven cat bonds have been issued in Hong Kong, totaling US$800 million, supporting countries across Asia and the Americas in sharing risks arising from typhoons and earthquakes with climate investors.

Another promising financial innovation is securitisation of infrastructure, which transforms brownfield infrastructure assets into investable products, thereby effectively unlocking capital for new greenfield projects. The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation is a pioneer in this space. It has made two issuances of securitised loans, covering 35 infrastructure projects across 16 countries and regions, with a combined value exceeding US$800 million. This model mobilises more private capital for green initiatives in emerging markets while unleashing the investment potential of their infrastructure assets.

Hong Kong is also rapidly emerging as a dynamic hub for green technology innovation. Today, over 250 green tech companies are operating in Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport, developing cutting-edge solutions in areas such as carbon capture, electric vehicle infrastructure, and sustainable building materials.

Many of these technologies are already being deployed across Southeast Asia and the Middle East, contributing to their decarbonisation efforts. This vibrant ecosystem remains open to global partners who are united by the shared mission of building a more sustainable and resilient future.

Digital innovation

Now let me turn to digital innovation, another key driver of global development. Across Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland, a wide spectrum of digital solutions are emerging, from fintech and smart health, to cloud computing, 6G, and digital city management.

What sets Hong Kong apart is our role as a bridge connecting the Chinese Mainland and the rest of the world. Solutions that succeed here carry a global seal of approval. Hong Kong is a trusted test bed for Chinese tech applications going global and vice versa. For Belt and Road economies and the Global South, Hong Kong offers not only access to cutting-edge technologies but also the assurance that they are fully aligned with the best international standards and practices.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a pivotal driving force behind digital innovation. Our country, China, has adopted an ""AI+"" strategy to promote digital transformation across industries. Here in Hong Kong, we share that vision. We have made AI one of our key strategic priorities, and are progressing at full speed on five key fronts: algorithms, data, computing power, capital and talent. At a time of intensifying technological fragmentation, we are committed to building an open, collaborative and inclusive AI community, and we invite global scientists and innovators to join us.

Blockchain technology is at the heart of financial innovation. Digital assets, such as tokenised deposits and bonds, are greatly improving the efficiency of financial transactions. Hong Kong is at the forefront of this development. We have issued two tranches of tokenised green bonds worth HK$6.8 billion, which were well received by the market. Recognising the value and importance of digital currency in cross-border applications, Hong Kong is an active participant in the mBridge Project, a pioneering central bank digital currencies initiative for cross-border settlements. Meanwhile, we have also introduced licensing regimes for digital asset exchanges and stablecoins. Adopting a prudent and risk-based approach, we encourage financial innovation to serve the real economy with guardrails to protect investors and the stability of financial systems. 

Closing

Ladies and gentlemen, I know I stand between you and your lunch, so I'll close by introducing our distinguished luncheon speaker, Mr Renat Bekturov, Governor of the Astana International Financial Centre. He joins us at a time when the collaboration between Hong Kong and Kazakhstan is growing stronger. Just two weeks ago, a leading mining company from Kazakhstan completed a dual listing in Hong Kong and the Astana International Exchange. It is the first Renminbi-denominated stock in Central Asia. Last week, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan also issued dim sum bonds of RMB2 billion here. It was also a pioneering move from a Central Asian government.

We are excited to hear Mr Bekturov's insights on Kazakhstan's latest developments, and how our two economies can collaborate more closely, build more partnerships and foster stronger connectivity.

On that note, I wish you a fortifying lunch, a fruitful Summit, and a most enjoyable stay in Hong Kong. Thank you very much."

Speech by Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services) at Climate Finance Forum: The Road to Net Zero (English only) (with photos),2025-09-10 14:48,2025-09-10 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000343.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services), Ms Salina Yan, at the Climate Finance Forum: The Road to Net Zero today (September 10):

Bonnie (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), Ms Bonnie Chan), Dirk (President and Chief Executive Officer of the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), Mr Dirk Forrister), Mary (Vice Chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) and Head of the GFANZ Secretariat, Ms Mary Schapiro), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 It is my great pleasure to join you at the Climate Finance Forum this morning.

 A lot of pertinent views and initiatives for action have been raised for achieving net zero over the past two days of the Hong Kong Green Week 2025. Financing is a critical part of the formula. As an eminent fundraising platform, the HKEX is well placed to host a forum on such an important topic, drawing on the reflections from the International Carbon Markets Summit held in this very same venue earlier this year. As an international financial centre with openness to the world and the unique advantage of connecting with the Mainland market, Hong Kong is keen to bring together market participants, experts and policymakers to deepen the dialogue and foster collaboration on climate finance.

 Hong Kong is staying its course on the green and sustainable agenda even as world co-operation on this is being put to the test. The Government has made clear policy commitments and set out concrete action plans to advance our role as a green finance hub, encouraging efficient asset allocation, innovation and public and private partnership to build an enabling ecosystem along the way.

 For example, it is well noted that Hong Kong arranges 45 per cent of green and sustainable bonds done through the region, leading the Asian market. We also have over 200 authorised environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds with over HK$1.1 trillion AUM (assets under management), an increase of 18 per cent from three years ago.

 Added to these, we have introduced two batches of tokenised government green bonds, and are earnestly preparing for the third issuance. Our plan is to regularise the issuance of tokenised bonds.

 With the same innovative spirit and recognising the long R&D (research and development) cycles and capital-intensive nature of innovation, the HKEX has introduced a dedicated listing channel for specialist companies developing breakthrough technologies, including those focusing on new energy, advanced materials, and environmental protection.

 There has been an active stream of listings of electric vehicles (EV), EV supply chains, energy storage, and hydrogen energy on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The market capitalisation of the new energy sector now stands at US$806 billion, an impressive six-fold growth compared with that of 10 years ago and representing over 13 per cent of the total Hong Kong stock market. Without a doubt, the HKEX is now one of the world's largest EV fundraising/investment platforms.

 Talking about new energy, the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government has promulgated an Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering, setting out an ambitious target to develop Hong Kong into a premier green maritime fuel bunkering and trading centre. We are also promoting the application of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Hong Kong International Airport and will announce an SAF consumption target within this year.

 With the setting up of the international carbon marketplace, Core Climate, for the trading of voluntary carbon credits, Hong Kong has taken one big step forward in advancing the carbon credit tool to encourage corporate decarbonisation. No doubt, Paul (Group General Counsel and Group Chief Sustainability Officer of the HKEX, Mr Paul Chow) will share with you more on this later this morning. For now, it is worth pointing out that Core Climate is currently the only carbon marketplace that offers Hong Kong Dollars and Renminbi settlement, and there has been substantial Belt and Road region participation in the 60-plus projects handled by Core Climate so far.

 Sustainability information disclosure provides the necessary transparency for the buy and sell sides as well as for general societal benefit. Last year, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau launched a Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in Hong Kong setting out the pathway for large publicly accountable entities to fully adopt the ISSB Standards (International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure Standards) of disclosure. The Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants has since published the Hong Kong Sustainability Disclosure Standards. In June 2025, Hong Kong was confirmed by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation as among the first set of jurisdictions having set a target of fully adopting the ISSB Standards. The HKEX acts even faster and became one of the first exchanges to update climate disclosure requirements in reference to IFRS S2.

 As part of the sustainability disclosure ecosystem, the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council plans to release a proposed local regulatory framework for sustainability assurance for public consultation within this year, covering issues such as the entities required to obtain assurance; the scope, timing as well as providers of assurance, etc. We look forward to the exchange of views at the Forum on Sustainability Disclosures this afternoon.

 Hong Kong is a steadfast believer in multilateral efforts and solutions. We are glad to have the presence of the International Emissions Trading Association and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero today. Through collaborations and concerted efforts, as well as empathy for the well-being of planet Earth, we have the potential to create a sustainable and resilient future, turning vision into action and reality. With these remarks, I wish all of you a fruitful Forum today. Thank you."
立法會十題：規管數字資產,2025-09-10 14:40,2025-09-10 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000346.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上譚岳衡議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

《穩定幣條例》（第656章）（《條例》）於上月一日生效後，非「認許提供者」不得向零售或專業投資者「要約提供」穩定幣。但據報虛擬資產場外交易（OTC）機構（包括找換店）目前不屬於《條例》下的認許提供者，令部分OTC機構可以利用《條例》的灰色地帶（例如以被動交易方式或客戶主動報價）繼續運營，規避《條例》監管，因而為投資者帶來風險及增加行業不確定性。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）針對上述非認許提供者規避《條例》監管的行為，政府現時有何措施預防、應對和監管；會否發布具體指引或例子，以進一步釐清何為《條例》中未明確定義的交易或營運行為；

（二）據報在現時的監管框架下，散戶投資者可能轉以不受《條例》監管的離岸平台交易或利用點對點交易，令他們需承擔更高的投資風險，政府將如何平衡嚴格監管與市場需求，包括完善監管制度、加快發牌審批、加強投資者教育，或擴大可交易資產範圍（例如合規穩定幣）等，以保障散戶投資者的利益；及

（三）鑑於政府於今年六月就設立數字資產交易及託管服務提供者發牌制度的立法建議發布諮詢文件，制訂該發牌制度的工作進展及立法時間表為何；如有立法時間表，詳情為何；如沒有立法時間表，原因為何？

答覆：

主席︰

《穩定幣條例》（第656章）（《條例》）已於二○二五年八月一日實施，其中一個目的是監管指明穩定幣的發行及限制可要約提供指明穩定幣的人士，以保障指明穩定幣持有人及潛在持有人。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢香港金融管理局（金管局）及證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會），現答覆如下：

（一）根據《條例》第9條，目前只有「認許提供者」可要約提供指明穩定幣。現時，《條例》指明五類「認許提供者」，分別為（一）持牌的穩定幣發行人、（二）由證監會發牌的虛擬資產服務提供者、（三）持有儲值支付工具牌照的人士、（四）獲證監會發牌進行第1類受規管活動的法團，及（五）認可機構。「認許提供者」可以向零售投資者和專業投資者要約提供由受金管局監管的持牌發行人發行的穩定幣（受監管的穩定幣）；至於非受監管的穩定幣，只可向專業投資者（根據《證券及期貨條例》（第571章）附表1第1部第1條的定義）要約提供。

虛擬資產場外交易機構目前不屬《條例》下的「認許提供者」，因此不能向零售或專業投資者要約提供指明穩定幣（不論該穩定幣是否受監管）。

《條例》實施初期，金管局會通過加強宣傳，加深業界對《條例》的認識，促使業界遵守《條例》的相關要求。同時，金管局會監察市面上涉及穩定幣交易的情況，如果發現有涉嫌違反《條例》的行為，會根據相關事實和證據，考慮進一步跟進行動。

（二）如上文所述，根據《條例》規定，目前只有「認許提供者」可要約提供指明穩定幣。公眾必須留意，目前金管局尚未向任何穩定幣發行人發出牌照。公眾向《條例》指明的「認許提供者」購買受監管穩定幣，才會受到《條例》的保障。假如公眾透過非受監管的渠道購買穩定幣，或購買任何非受監管的穩定幣，須自行承擔風險。

金管局會透過不同渠道，包括社交媒體平台，持續進行公眾教育，以加深公眾對《條例》的認識。

（三）財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）於二○二五年六月發表的《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》表明，優化法律與監管是推動數字資產行業發展的其中一個重點。政府及金融監管機構會繼續秉持「相同業務、相同風險、相同規則」的原則，強調風險為本，持續優化和建立一套既切合本地情況，又依循國際標準和慣例的監管制度，為香港數字資產市場健康、負責任和可持續發展提供穩固基礎。

財庫局與證監會剛於二○二五年六月二十七日至八月二十九日期間，就數字資產交易及託管服務提供者發牌制度的立法建議進行了公眾諮詢。財庫局與證監會正參考公眾諮詢所得的意見，制訂相關發牌制度的細節，並將適時公布立法時間表。"
LCQ10: Regulation of digital assets,2025-09-10 14:40,2025-09-10 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000338.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Tan Yueheng and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

 Since the Stablecoins Ordinance (Cap. 656) (the Ordinance) came into effect on the first of last month, non-permitted offerors have been prohibited from offering stablecoins to retail or professional investors. However, it has been reported that as virtual asset over-the-counter (OTC) trading institutions (including money changers) are currently not classified as permitted offerors under the Ordinance, some OTC trading institutions can take advantage of the grey areas of the Ordinance, such as through passive trading or customer-initiated quotes, to continue operation while circumventing the Ordinance, hence posing risks to investors and increasing industry uncertainty. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the current measures in place to prevent, address, and regulate the aforesaid circumvention of the Ordinance by non-permitted offerors; whether it will release specific guidelines or examples to further clarify what constitute transactions or operational activities that are not explicitly defined in the Ordinance;

(2) as it has been reported that under the current regulatory framework, retail investors may switch to trading on offshore platforms not regulated by the Ordinance or using P2P transactions, hence subjecting them to higher investment risks, how the Government will strike a balance between strict regulation and market demand, including improving the regulatory regime, expediting licensing approvals, strengthening investor education, and broadening the scope of tradable assets (e.g. compliant stablecoins), to protect the interests of retail investors; and

(3) given that the Government issued a consultation paper in June this year on legislative proposals for regulating digital asset dealing and custodian services, of the progress of the establishment of the licensing regime and the legislative timetable; if there is a legislative timetable, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Stablecoins Ordinance (Cap. 656) (Ordinance) came into effect on August 1, 2025. One of its purposes is to regulate the issue of specified stablecoins and impose restrictions on the persons who may offer specified stablecoins, with a view to protecting holders and potential holders of specified stablecoins.

 After consultation with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) Under section 9 of the Ordinance, currently only ""permitted offerors"" may offer specified stablecoins. At present, the Ordinance specifies five types of ""permitted offerors"", namely (1) licensed stablecoin issuers; (2) virtual asset service providers licensed by the SFC; (3) persons with a stored value facility licence; (4) corporations licensed by the SFC to conduct Type 1 regulated activities; and (5) authorised institutions. ""Permitted offerors"" may offer stablecoins issued by licensed issuers regulated by the HKMA (i.e. regulated stablecoins) to both retail and professional investors; however, unregulated stablecoins may only be offered to professional investors (as defined in section 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571)).

 Virtual asset over-the-counter (OTC) trading institutions are not ""permitted offerors"" under the Ordinance, and therefore cannot offer specified stablecoins to retail or professional investors, regardless of whether such stablecoins are regulated.

 During the initial implementation of the Ordinance, the HKMA will step up publicity efforts to enhance the industry's understanding of the Ordinance and promote the industry's compliance with its relevant requirements. At the same time, the HKMA will monitor transactions involving stablecoin in the market. If a suspected contravention of the Ordinance is identified, the HKMA will consider follow-up action based on the relevant facts and evidence.

(2) As mentioned above, under the Ordinance, currently only ""permitted offerors"" are permitted to offer specified stablecoins. Members of the public must note that the HKMA has not licensed any stablecoin issuer yet. While the Ordinance offers protection to members of the public who purchase regulated stablecoins from ""permitted offerors"" as specified in the Ordinance, members of the public who acquire stablecoins through unregulated channels or acquire any unregulated stablecoins will have to bear their own risk.

 The HKMA will continue to conduct public education through various channels, including social media platforms, to enhance public understanding of the Ordinance.

(3) In the ""Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong"" issued in June 2025, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) has made clear that enhancing the legal and regulatory framework is one of the key focuses in promoting the development of the digital asset sector. Guided by the principle of ""same activity, same risks, same regulation"" under a risk-based approach, the Government and financial regulators will continue to enhance and establish a regulatory framework that reflects local circumstances and aligns with international standards and practices, with a view to providing a solid foundation for the healthy, responsible and sustainable development of the digital asset market in Hong Kong.

 The FSTB and the SFC recently conducted a public consultation on the legislative proposals for the licensing regimes for digital asset dealing and custodian service providers from June 27 to August 29, 2025. The FSTB and the SFC are formulating details of the licensing regimes based on the views received from the public consultation, and will announce the legislative timetable in due course."

（三）作為香港銀行的監管部門，金管局一直有向銀行收集不同類別的數據，用作風險監察評估和了解銀行業務情況。

針對香港銀行的人民幣匯款業務，除上文列出的跨境匯款交易數據外，金管局亦有定期對外公布香港銀行跨境貿易結算的人民幣匯款總額。相關數據如下：

（四）每間銀行的跨境支付服務規模和操作模式不盡相同，各銀行會按自身的情況釐定有關服務的手續費結構和水平，此屬銀行的商業決定。然而，銀行在提供跨境支付服務時，應遵從《銀行營運守則》，當中包括向客戶提供相關服務的詳情，如有關服務的基本資料、匯出款項的匯率基準、客戶須支付予銀行的任何手續費或收費詳情、以及境外代理銀行收取的手續費或收費（如有）。金管局期望透過保持跨境支付服務收費的透明度，促進市場的競爭。

就金錢服務經營者方面，由於它們的經營模式及運作情況不盡相同，業界並沒有劃一的匯款手續費結構。

（五）根據現時內地法規，香港居民在內地用於旅遊、商務、留學、日常生活、贍家等支出一般可以透過銀行辦理跨境匯款。在資金用途符合規定的情況下，如選用人民幣進行匯款，在現行安排下香港居民每人每日有八萬元人民幣額度匯款至同名賬戶。如選用其他非人民幣幣種（包括港元），收款人每人每年有等值五萬美元的結匯便利化額度。若收款人能提供材料證明匯款真實合規，政策上亦容許香港居民在銀行直接辦理匯款到內地的業務，不佔用以上提到的額度。

近年在兩地金融管理部門和業界的努力下，我們積極推出個人匯款便利化安排，包括二○二四年初推出的粵港澳大灣區內地城市購房支付便利化安排，方便香港居民將購房相關款項通過兩地銀行體系匯入內地。今年六月二十二日，金管局和中國人民銀行推出「跨境支付通」，香港居民可以經香港的參與機構使用轉數快進行即時小額的跨境匯款。

我們留意部分市民期望跨境匯款安排可進一步優化，便利在內地常住的香港居民進行生活配套環節相關的跨境交易，例如出入起居、醫療保健、退休養老等活動。我們正與內地金融部門積極探討在不同場景下推出更多金融便民措施。

（六）在公眾教育宣傳方面，金管局於今年初在網站發布常見問題集，解說在不同跨境匯款場景下內地現行的政策安排，並介紹現有兩地銀行和儲值支付工具提供的匯款及支付產品服務。金管局隨後進行銀行業界簡報會，討論落實安排，並提醒各銀行在處理客戶查詢時，確保前線人員知悉相關的政策安排並回應客戶的查詢。

此外，香港海關亦十分重視保障消費者的權益，不時透過多種途徑，如新聞公報、社交媒體宣傳合法合規的找換及匯款服務，並提醒消費者在選擇匯款服務時，應考慮整體因素，包括金錢服務經營者的交付渠道、商譽等，並注意匯款存在的風險。香港海關亦積極向不同社群提供宣傳及教育講座，如二○二四年至二○二五年六月期間，香港海關就「補充勞工優化計劃」為超過21 000名新來港的工作的勞工舉辦了超過160場講座，向他們講解使用匯款服務時所需注意事項。

（七）《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》（第615章）訂立了金錢服務經營者的發牌制度，賦權香港海關對金錢服務經營者的合規情況進行監管。

在現行的發牌制度下，金錢服務經營者在申請牌照或續牌時，必須符合適當人選的要求，以及向香港海關提交業務計劃，當中需要闡述其營運模式和其合理性、明確披露資金流向和交付渠道，以及具備有效合宜的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集措施及日常營運監察機制。透過上述的發牌要求，香港海關能有效評估和監察不同營運模式和規模的金錢服務經營者的相關風險。

香港海關非常重視金錢服務業提供匯款服務的合規情況，並一直採取不同措施確保金錢服務經營者以適當方式處理客戶的款項及完成相關交易。其中，香港海關已制訂《金錢服務經營者牌照指引》及《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引》，確保持牌金錢服務經營者遵從客戶盡職審查、備存紀錄、妥善處理客戶款項及其他發牌規定。對於業務有較高風險的金錢服務經營者（例如客戶性質、產品、服務、交易或交付渠道等因素），香港海關亦會施加特定的牌照條件以加強監管。香港海關將繼續留意市場發展，並適時檢視金錢服務業相關監察機制的要求。"
LCQ12: Enhancement of cross-boundary remittance arrangements,2025-09-10 14:15,2025-09-10 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025090900719.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Dennis Leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

 There are views pointing out that the demand for cross-boundary remittances between Hong Kong and the Mainland is increasing, yet restrictions on remittance limits and channel regulation remain imperfect. Regarding the enhancement of cross-boundary remittance arrangements, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on (i) the number of agencies providing cross-boundary remittance services between Hong Kong and the Mainland, (ii) the total amount of remittance involved, and (iii) the total amount of banks' revenue from the provision of the relevant cross-boundary remittance services under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme in each of the years between January 2016 and June 2025 (set out in Table 1‍);

Table 1

(3) whether the Government has requested that remittance agencies compile statistics on the use of remittances by individuals/institutions; if so, of the details (including a breakdown of the data on the use of remittances); if not, whether it will request that remittance agencies compile the relevant data and standardise the category of the relevant uses;

(4) whether it has compiled statistics on the remittance handling fee structure (including the actual fee charged for each remittance) of the various legal and authorised remittance agencies (such as banks) providing northbound cross-boundary remittance services in Hong Kong and the Mainland to individuals from January 2019 to June 2025, as well as the total amount of proceeds earned from remittance services provided by such agencies;

(5) as there are views that the Mainland's facilitative foreign exchange arrangement subject to an annual quota of US$50,000 per person has not been adjusted in light of market developments, whether the Government has plans to discuss with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange the adjustment of this quota against the background of the ongoing deepening of the financial co-operation between Hong Kong and the Mainland as well as the joint promotion of cross-boundary financial interconnection and mutual access in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area;

(6) whether the Government will consider encouraging banks to adjust their fees and charges for cross-boundary remittances and stepping up public education and publicity to encourage members of the public to remit money through legal and compliant channels; if not, of the reasons for that; and

(7) whether it will consider further regulating the operations of non-‍banking agencies involved in cross-boundary remittance services (e.g. money changers, etc), including requiring such agencies to transfer fund through legal and compliant channels, and setting up mechanisms on minimum capital requirements, risk reserve standards and daily operational monitoring; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 In consultation with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED), my reply to the seven parts of the question is as follows:

(1) Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors are foreign institutional investors approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to use funds from outside mainland China to invest in domestic securities and futures. We do not maintain relevant data of the number of agencies, the total amount of remittance, and the total amount of banks' revenue from the provision of the relevant cross-boundary remittance services.

(2) The figures of Renminbi (RMB) cross-boundary remittance transactions from Hong Kong to the Mainland (including individual and non-individual remitters) are as follows:

(3) As the regulator of banks in Hong Kong, the HKMA has been collecting different scope of data from banks, for the purpose of conducting risk assessments and continuous monitoring on banks' business.

 In respect of RMB remittance business of banks in Hong Kong, besides the statistics on cross-boundary remittance transactions set out above, the HKMA also regularly releases banks' RMB remittance for trade settlement business, with relevant data as below:




Year

2025 (January to June)

(4) There are different scales and operational models of the cross-boundary payment services across banks. Individual banks would set their fee structure and level for the services according to the bank's own circumstances as a commercial decision of the banks. Nonetheless, banks should comply with the relevant requirements of the Code of Banking Practice when providing cross-boundary payment services. These include, among other things, providing for customers details of the services they offer, such as a basic description of the service; the basis on which exchange rates will be applied; details of any commission or charges payable by customers to the bank; and other commission or charges levied by correspondent banks outside Hong Kong (if available). By maintaining transparency of the fees charged by banks in providing cross-boundary payment services, the HKMA hopes to enhance competition in this market segment.

 As for money service operators, since their business models and operational circumstances vary, there is no uniform fee structure for remittance services across the industry.

(5) According to the prevailing Mainland regulations, Hong Kong residents can in general remit funds to the Mainland through banks for spending or expenses related to travel, business trips, study abroad, daily life, and family support, etc. Within this scope, if the remittances are made in RMB, Hong Kong residents can transfer funds to their same-name bank accounts on the Mainland, subject to a daily limit of RMB80,000, under the existing arrangements. If the remittances are made in non-RMB currencies (including HKD), there is a facilitative arrangement available for individual recipients, subject to an annual quota equivalent to USD50,000. If the recipients can provide supporting documents to confirm genuineness of the remittances, the policy also allows Hong Kong residents to make cross-boundary remittances to the Mainland without utilising the aforementioned limits.

 With the efforts of financial regulators and the industry in Hong Kong and the Mainland in recent years, we have introduced various facilitative arrangements on personal cross-boundary remittance. In early 2024, facilitation arrangements for remittances were introduced to facilitate Hong Kong residents purchasing properties in the Mainland cities of theGuangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to remit funds related to property purchases to the Mainland through the banking system. The HKMA and the People's Bank of China launched Payment Connect on June 22 this year. Hong Kong residents can make real-time and small-value cross-boundary remittances at participating institutions in Hong Kong via Faster Payment System.

 We notice that some citizens wish for further enhancement to cross-boundary remittance arrangements to facilitate cross-boundary transactions relating to their everyday life on the Mainland, for example, transportation and living, medical services, retirement and elderly care, etc. We are engaging with Mainland authorities to explore further facilitative measures under different scenarios.

(6) In respect of public education, the HKMA released a set of FAQs on the website at the beginning of this year, explaining the current Mainland policy arrangements under different scenarios on cross-boundary remittance, and introducing the remittance and payment products provided by banks and stored value payment facilities in Hong Kong and the Mainland. Subsequently the HKMA held an industry briefing with banks to discuss the implementation arrangements, and reminded banks to ensure that frontline staff are aware of the relevant policy arrangements and handle clients' inquiries accordingly.

 The C&ED places great importance on safeguarding consumer rights. It regularly promotes legally compliant money changing and remittance services through various channels, such as press releases and social media, and reminds consumers to consider a range of factors (including the delivery channels and reputation of the money service operators (MSOs)) in a comprehensive manner when choosing remittance services, as well as to be aware of the risks associated with remittance. The C&ED also actively provides promotional and educational talks to different communities. For example, between 2024 and June 2025, the C&ED conducted over 160 talks for over 21 000 workers newly arrived in Hong Kong under the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme, educating them on points to note when using remittance services.

(7) The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Cap. 615) (AMLO) provides for a licensing regime for MSOs, empowering the C&ED to supervise their compliance.

 Under the current licensing system, when applying for a licence or licence renewal, MSOs must meet the ""fit and proper"" test, and submit a business plan to the C&ED. This plan must explain their operating model and its rationale, clearly disclose the flow of funds and delivery channels, and demonstrate the existence of effective and appropriate anti-money laundering and terrorist financing measures and a daily operational monitoring mechanism. Through these licensing requirements, the C&ED can effectively assess and monitor the risks associated with MSOs of different operating models and sizes.

 The C&ED attaches great importance to the compliance of the money service industry in providing remittance services and has consistently taken various measures to ensure that MSOs handle customer funds and complete relevant transactions in an appropriate manner. Among these, the C&ED has formulated the ""Money Service Operators Licensing Guide"" and the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism"" to ensure licensed MSOs comply with customer due diligence, record-keeping, proper handling of customer funds, and other licensing requirements. For MSOs with higher risk profiles (due to factors such as customer nature, products, services, transactions, or delivery channels), the C&ED may also impose specific licence conditions to strengthen supervision. The C&ED will continue to monitor market developments and review the requirements of the relevant regulatory mechanisms for the money service industry."
立法會四題：人口政策規劃和資源分配,2025-09-10 14:11,2025-09-10 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000285.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上梁毓偉議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的答覆：

問題：

根據政府統計處發布的二○二五年年中人口數字，香港受惠於各項吸引人才措施，整體人口呈輕微增長。另一方面，社會亦關注外來人口融入社會，以及有關的社會資源分配問題。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年及本年至今，每年各項人才入境計劃中以受養人身分來港的人數為何；當局有否推算未來數年因該等計劃而可能增加的人口數目；

（二）據悉近年經各項人才入境計劃來港的外來人口達數以十萬，當局有何措施協調教育、醫療、住屋以至就業等方面的政策及配套安排，以滿足本地及外來人口的需要；會否加強對輸入人才的追蹤調研和分析，以優化各項人才入境計劃的成效；及

（三）在制訂新一輪輸入人才政策的指標時，政府會否同時考慮相關人才入境計劃對人口結構的整體影響，並從高層次及宏觀角度制訂政策規劃和分配公共資源；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府統計處（統計處）每五年定期編製最新人口推算，以掌握推算期內香港人口的變化趨勢，從而為政府在各方面的政策及資源分配上的規劃提供基礎。

為應對人口高齡化帶來的人力需求挑戰，政府於二○二二年年底推出一系列措施積極招攬世界人才。過去數年，外來人才陸續抵港，部份更攜同家眷來港落戶，抵銷了人口自然減少的影響，有效緩解本地生育率長期偏低及人口高齡化所帶來的挑戰。二○二五年年中的人口較二○二二年年中增加超過十八萬人。此外，這些生力軍亦扭轉了本地勞動人口在疫情期間的跌勢，當中大部分更處於職涯上的黃金年齡，有助進一步豐富本地人才庫，提升香港的整體競爭力。香港在國際管理發展學院昨日發布的《2025年世界人才排名》中位列亞洲第一，全球排名由去年的第九位躍升至第四位，歷來最高，足證本屆政府推出的一系列「搶人才」措施方向正確，成效顯著。

就議員的提問，經諮詢教育局、醫務衞生局、房屋局、統計處和入境事務處（入境處）後，現答覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年八月底，各項人才入境計劃已吸引超過23‍萬名人才抵港，當中部分攜同配偶及18歲以下未婚的受養子女來港。二○二三年起，各項人才入境計劃下累計有近22萬名人士以受‍養人身分來港。按人才入境計劃的分項數目載於附件。

勞工及福利局（勞褔局）和統計處分別於二○二四年及二○二三年公布最新的人力推算和人口推算。兩項推算均已經顧及主要人才入境計劃的影響。勞褔局現正開展人力推算的中期更新工作，綜合評估環球及本地最新發展（包括政府最新的人力政策及措施）對二○二八年人力情況的影響，預計在二○二六年第四季公布結果。另一方面，統計處將於二○二六年進行人口普查，搜集本港人口的最新基準資料，並會於普查結果備妥後，綜合屆時可知有關生育、死亡及人口遷移的最新數據和政策因素，更新人口推算。

（二）及（三）目前人口政策措施已融入各政策局的工作，成為恆常政策的一部分。相關政策局不時檢視其負責的措施的執行情況及成效，並跨局相互協作，因應社會、人口和人力最新情況策劃及推行不同的政策措施，例如：教育局會不時檢視教育政策，切合社會需要；醫務衞生局會繼續深化醫療體系改革，包括強化基層醫療促進健康和疾病預防，致力推展公營醫療收費改革，並提高私營醫療服務收費透明度，鼓勵善用醫療保險，確保香港醫療體系行穩致遠；房屋局會繼續密切留意各類房屋的供求情況，並適時作出相應的政策調整。行政長官、司長和副司長亦會按需要透過不同委員會、工作組和跨部門會議等不同形式提供高層次督導，統籌跨部門的相關工作，按本地人口及各行業人力情況的變化，持續檢視相關措施的執行情況及成效，並適時調整，以滿足香港經濟及社會發展的需要。

在人力資源規劃方面，政府會因應社會發展和人力需求趨勢優化本地培訓、「搶人才」和「留人才」措施，按情況訂立相應績效指標。事實上，政府一直在獲批人才首次入境及申請續簽時收集他們在港的就業情況，而勞福局轄下的香港人才服務辦公室亦與來港人才保持密切聯繫，線上線下了解和跟進他們在香港的發展及需要，並提供支援。就本屆政府嶄新推出的高端人才通行證計劃而言，勞福局更會在入境處發出續期簽證時邀請申請人參與跟進調查，以了解獲批續簽的高才在住屋、受養子女教育等方面的情況。首批跟進調查結果及續簽情況上月已公布。勞福局會繼續經不同途徑了解來港人才在港落戶的情況，作為持續優化輸入人才政策及支援服務的參考。

多謝主席。"
LCQ4: Population policy planning and resource allocation,2025-09-10 14:11,2025-09-10 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000286.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Leung and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  According to the statistics of mid-year population for 2025 released by the Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong's overall population has shown slight growth, benefiting from various measures on talent attraction. On the other hand, society is also concerned about the integration of immigrants and the related issues of social resource allocation. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of persons who came to Hong Kong as dependants under various talent admission schemes in each of the past three years and this year to date; whether the authorities have projected the potential increase in population in the coming years as a result of such schemes;

(2) as it is learnt that in recent years, hundreds of thousands of immigrants have come to Hong Kong through various talent admission schemes, of the measures put in place by the authorities to co-ordinate policies and supporting arrangements in areas such as education, healthcare, housing and employment to meet the needs of both the local and immigrant populations; whether tracking surveys and studies and analysis of admitted talents will be strengthened so as to optimise the effectiveness of various talent admission schemes; and

(3) when formulating the indicators for the new round of talent admission policies, whether the Government will simultaneously consider the overall impact of the relevant talent admission schemes on the population structure, and formulate policy planning and allocate public resources from a high-level and macro perspective; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) compiles new population projection every five years to understand the trend of change in Hong Kong's population during the projection period so as to provide the basis for the Government's planning in various policy areas and resource allocation.

  To address the challenges in manpower demand brought by an ageing population, the Government implemented in end-2022 a package of measures to proactively trawl for talents from around the world. In recent years, outside talents gradually arrived in Hong Kong, with some bringing along their families to settle in Hong Kong. This has offset the impact of natural population decrease and effectively alleviating the challenges caused by the persistently low local birth rate and the ageing of the population. The overall population in mid-2025 has increased by over 180 000 compared to mid-2022. In addition, the arrival of these incoming talents has reversed the decline in the local labour force during the pandemic, and the majority of them are in the prime years of their careers. This further enriches the local talent pool and enhances Hong Kong's overall competitiveness. Hong Kong ranked first in Asia in the World Talent Ranking 2025 published yesterday by the International Institute for Management Development, leaping markedly to fourth globally from ninth last year and marking the highest-ever ranking. This is clear evidence that the series of talent attraction measures implemented by the current-term Government are in the right direction and yielding significant results.

  In consultation with the Education Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Housing Bureau, the C&SD, and the Immigration Department (ImmD), my reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) As at end-August 2025, the various talent admission schemes have attracted over 230 000 talents arriving in Hong Kong. Some brought along to Hong Kong their spouses and unmarried dependent children under the age of 18. Nearly 220 000 individuals have arrived in Hong Kong as dependants under the various talent admission schemes since 2023. A breakdown of the relevant statistics by talent admission scheme is at Annex.

  The Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) and the C&SD published the latest manpower projection and population projection in 2024 and 2023 respectively. These projections have taken into account the impact of the major talent admission schemes. The LWB is now conducting a mid-term update of the manpower projection, which will comprehensively assess the implications of the latest global and local developments (including the Government's latest manpower policies and measures) on the manpower situation in 2028. The results are expected to be released in the fourth quarter of 2026. On the other hand, the C&SD will conduct a population census in 2026 to obtain up-to-date benchmark information of the Hong Kong population. When the census results become available, the C&SD will update the population projection upon integrating the available data then about fertility, mortality and population movement with the prevailing policy factors.

(2) and (3) Currently, population policy measures have been subsumed under the portfolios of various bureaux as part of the ongoing efforts. The relevant policy bureaux are regularly reviewing the implementation and effectiveness of the measures under their purviews, performing their respective duties with cross-bureau collaboration so as to formulate and implement various policy measures in response to the latest social, demographic and manpower conditions. For instance, the Education Bureau will review education policies from time to time, with a view to meeting the needs of society. The Health Bureau will continue to deepen the reform of the healthcare system, including strengthening health promotion and disease prevention in primary healthcare; implementing reform on fees and charges for public healthcare; as well as enhancing the price transparency of private healthcare services, and encouraging better use of medical insurance to ensure the viability of Hong Kong's healthcare system. The Housing Bureau will continue to closely monitor the supply and demand of different types of housing and adjust the corresponding policies in a timely manner. The Chief Executive, and Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries of Departments are providing high-level steer as necessary through various channels, such as committees, working groups and inter-departmental meetings, to co-ordinate relevant inter-departmental work in light of changes in the local demography and manpower situation in various industries, continuously review the implementation and effectiveness of relevant measures and make timely adjustments, so as to meet Hong Kong's economic and social development needs.

  As regards human resources planning, the Government will enhance the measures on local training, talent attraction and retention, in response to the trends of social development and manpower demand, and set corresponding key performance indicators as appropriate. In fact, the Government has been consistently collecting information on the employment situation of talents approved for admission upon their first entries and at the time of their applications for extension of stay. The Hong Kong Talent Engage under the LWB also maintains close contact with incoming talents to understand and keep track of their development and needs in Hong Kong through both online and offline channels, and provide support services. In respect of the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) newly launched by the current-term Government, the LWB will further invite applicants to participate in follow-up surveys when the ImmD issues their visas for extension of stay, in order to gather information on such areas as housing and education for dependent children of the TTPS talents approved for extension of stay. The first round of findings of the follow-up surveys and the situation of the extension of stay were released last month. The LWB will continue to keep in view the settlement of incoming talents in Hong Kong through various channels, and use the information as reference for the ongoing enhancement of talent admission policies and support services.

  Thank you, President."
LCQ20: Reclamation project for Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands,2025-09-10 13:08,2025-09-10 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000386.htm,"âFollowing is a question by Dr the Hon Lo Wai-kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  The Special Administrative Region Government has earlier on indicated that the Government would first concentrate its efforts on pressing ahead the development of the Northern Metropolis, while the pace to take forward the reclamation project for the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands (KYCAI project) could be slowed down. Nevertheless, the authorities would prudently complete the necessary preparatory work in the study stage. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that in the reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on the Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 2025-2026, the Government indicated that the Civil Engineering and Development Department was reviewing and fine-tuning the relevant background information and project description in the Environmental Impact Assessment report for the KYCAI project, and would make the report available for public inspection in a timely manner, of the latest progress of the relevant work;

(2) of the studies being undertaken by the Government on the KYCAI project which seek to ensure that the construction works of the project can be commenced swiftly at appropriate times in the future; and

(3) whether a development timetable has been drawn up for the KYCAI project at present; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  Land production takes time, involving various aspects of planning and studies, as well as the implementation of various land and infrastructure projects. It is the Government's responsibility to plan ahead and lead land development with a long-term perspective, ensuring that adequate land is supplied in a timely manner to support Hong Kong's long-term economic development and people's livelihood needs. The Government is also keenly aware that land has to be rolled out in a gradual and pragmatic manner, taking into account a basket of factors, including, inter alia, the market economic conditions. Having carefully reviewed these factors, the Government publicly stated earlier this year that it will currently focus on developing the Northern Metropolis. The Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands (Kau Yi Chau) project, as another major land development project, is accorded a lower priority. However, the Government will continue with the studies already commenced on the Kau Yi Chau project.

  The replies to the various parts of the question raised by Dr the Hon Lo Wai-kwok are as follows:

(1) The Kau Yi Chau project is currently in its early planning and study stage. The Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIA Report) relating to the reclamation to the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on December 31 last year. Although the EPD subsequently informed the CEDD that the EIA Report was suitable for public inspection, given that the implementation programme of the Kau Yi Chau project has been slowed down and no specific arrangements have been made, the Development Bureau, after reviewing the situation, considers it inappropriate to proceed with the relevant statutory EIA procedures (including public inspection, submission of the EIA Report to the Advisory Council on the Environment, and consideration by the Director of Environmental Protection for the approval of the EIA Report) at this stage. Proceeding with the above procedures without a target reclamation timetable could hinder focused discussion and arouse public concerns about the relevance of the approval results after a period of time. To avoid unnecessary public speculation and debate on the Kau Yi Chau project, we recommend adopting a more prudent arrangement. This involves waiting until the implementation timetable for the reclamation works is mostly ascertained and the EIA Report is updated as needed before submitting the EIA Report to the EPD, as well as exhibiting it for public inspection and seeking approval.

(2) The Kau Yi Chau project is a source of long-term land supply. Therefore, although there is no concrete timetable for its implementation, the analysis and information obtained from the ongoing studies are particularly crucial for the future implementation of the project. Such information remains applicable and retains significant reference value, which will help expedite the commencement of the Kau Yi Chau project when conditions permit. Currently, the Government will continue to complete the ongoing studies, including ground investigation, preliminary design of reclamation and major transportation infrastructure, and technical assessments related to land development. Even after these studies are completed, further studies, particularly detailed engineering design, will be required before progressing to the reclamation phase. However, the studies already undertaken form a good basis for us to commence other necessary preparatory work at the appropriate time.

(3) In view of the situation mentioned above, the Government has not yet formulated a timetable for the implementation of the Kau Yi Chau project. In fact, we do not have the necessary conditions for the reclamation project to be carried out within this term of Government."
立法會三題：改善政府及公營機構的採購程序,2025-09-10 13:05,2025-09-10 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000368.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上尚海龍議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的答覆：

問題：

據報近日有政府部門被發現在執行採購程序上有嚴重疏漏和不足。有意見認為，事件反映政府未能在執行層面上嚴謹監督。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）如何加強監督政府部門的採購過程，以確保其嚴格遵守採購指引；會否引入更頻密的第三方審查或數字化監察系統，以即時識別及糾正採購程序中的異常情況；

（二）在檢討現行採購程序時，會否考慮在合約管理、供應商表現評核、價格與質量平衡機制等方面作出優化，引入更具彈性及競爭性的採購模式（例如電子投標或動態報價系統），並加強採購資料的透明度（例如定期向本會提交政府部門的採購合約摘要及供應商評分，讓本會能更有效地監察採購程序）；及

（三）會否為公營機構（例如醫院管理局及香港房屋委員會等）制訂更清晰的採購操作指引，並提供定期培訓及技術支援，以減少因執行細節失誤而導致的採購問題？

答覆：

主席：

政府各政策局和部門（下稱部門）採購的貨品和服務繁多，由通用和專業物品（如藥物和檢測儀器），以至服務合約（如管理安老院舍和清潔街道）。有見近日社會對政府個別採購項目的關注，尚海龍議員的提問正好讓我向大家闡述政府的採購制度：

（一）及（二）政府的採購政策是透過公平、公開及具競爭性的採購程序，取得物有所值的貨品和服務；同時透過《物料供應及採購規例》及相關通告，為採購工作訂立框架，並為採購流程提供詳細指引。

實際上，並非所有政府採購均由政府物流服務署（物流署）負責。一般而言，物流署會為部門供應所需的通用物品和採購價值超過一千萬元的貨品，而部門則自行負責採購服務和價值較低的貨品。政府人員在採購時，必須嚴格遵循《物料供應及採購規例》及相關通告。部門的管制人員亦有責任提醒轄下人員遵守相關規例，並監察循規情況。

在現行的採購制度下，各方的職責分工和工作流程均清晰明確，亦設有監察與制衡為採購過程把關。就採購貨品和服務而言，部門根據其運作需要訂定採購要求，投標書評審委員會在評審標書和推薦中標者後，將提交予由部門首長級人員領導的投標委員會進一步審核。視乎合約價值，較大額的採購則需交予物流署投標委員會或中央投標委員會審議，以確保採購合規。

此外，我們另有措施監察部門的採購工作。現時，部門須每兩年進行一次「自行評估」，以提高人員遵守採購規定的意識及加強自我監察。物流署亦設有專隊，不時到訪部門抽查採購紀錄，作第三方審查。過去三年，物流署每年平均查核超過100個採購項目，當中亦有就個別項目建議改善措施。

持續提升採購人員的專業知識與執行能力對完善採購工作至關重要，因此物流署定期舉辦研討會和培訓班。過去三年，物流署共舉辦超過20場培訓活動，參加人次超過1 600。

我們在數字化方面亦不遺餘力，政府的電子化投標系統於二○○九年啓用，逐步讓供應商可以上網查閱招標公告、下載招標文件、遞交標書、以及查閱已批出的合約公告等。我們會與時並進，積極研究在採購工作或監察流程引入科技，以進一步提升採購效率。

在表現評核及合約管理方面，部門在評審標書時會考慮投標者的往績。現時標準合約條款已訂明政府有權取消曾經嚴重或持續違約的投標者投標資格。批出合約後，部門須定期評估承辦商的表現，若表現欠佳，必須按合約條款採取行動，例如發出警告、停止付款、扣減按金，甚至終止合約等。

政府一直保持採購資訊的高透明度，公眾可在網上查閱政府招標公告、已批出的合約資料和主要採購預覽，以及標準合約條款等。

專責小組（檢討政府採購機制專責小組）已於八月下旬召開第一次會議，我們會聚焦在盡職調查、招標準則、合約管理和質量保證等方面提出優化建議。

（三）就尚議員有關公營機構的提問，公營機構可按其需要制訂自身的採購機制。醫院管理局和香港房屋委員會已分別制定採購規例或指引供其員工遵從，亦有定期為相關人員舉辦培訓課程。政府會不時與公營機構分享良好作業做法，以確保公共資源得到善用。

多謝主席。"
LCQ3: Improving procurement processes of Government and public organisations,2025-09-10 13:05,2025-09-10 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000370.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Shang Hailong and a reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  It has been reported that a government department was recently found to have serious oversights and deficiencies in implementing its procurement process. There are views that the incident reflects the Government's failure to exercise rigorous supervision at the implementation level. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) how it will step up supervision of government departments' procurement processes to ensure strict adherence to procurement guidelines; whether it will introduce more frequent third-party audits or digital monitoring systems to promptly identify and rectify anomalies in procurement processes;

(2) when reviewing the existing procurement processes, whether it will consider optimising aspects such as contract management, supplier performance evaluation and price-quality balancing mechanisms, introducing more flexible and competitive procurement models (e.g. electronic tendering or dynamic pricing systems), and enhancing the transparency of procurement information (e.g. regularly submitting summaries of government departments' procurement contracts and supplier ratings to this Council, so that this Council can more effectively monitor the procurement processes); and

(3) whether it will formulate clearer operational guidelines on procurement for public organisations (e.g. the Hospital Authority and the Hong Kong Housing Authority), and provide regular training and technical support to reduce procurement issues arising from errors in implementation details?

Reply:

President,

  Government bureaux and departments (hereafter referred to as ""departments"") procure a wide variety of goods and services, ranging from common goods and professional items (e.g. pharmaceuticals and testing equipment) to service contracts (e.g. management of elderly homes and street cleansing). Having regard to society's concern over individual government procurement exercises recently, the question raised by the Hon Shang Hailong provides a good opportunity for me to elaborate on the government procurement regime:

(1) and (2) The Government's procurement policy is to obtain goods and services at the best value for money through fair, open and competitive procurement procedures. Meanwhile, the Stores and Procurement Regulations (SPRs) and relevant circulars set out the procurement framework and provide detailed guidelines on procurement procedures.

  Indeed, not all government procurement exercises are handled by the Government Logistics Department (GLD). In general, GLD supplies commonly used items to departments and procures goods for departments at a value exceeding $10 million, whereas respective departments are responsible for procuring services as well as goods at a lower value. When conducting procurement, public officers should follow the SPRs and relevant circulars strictly. Controlling Officers of the departments also have the responsibility to remind officers under their purview to comply with the relevant regulations and closely monitor their compliance.

  The prevailing procurement regime has put in place checks and balances with clear segregation of responsibilities and well-defined workflow to safeguard the procurement process. As far as the procurement of goods and services is concerned, departments formulate procurement requirements in accordance with their operational needs, and tender assessment panels (TAPs) evaluate tender submissions and recommend a tender for acceptance. TAPs' recommendation is subject to further evaluation by tender committees chaired by directorate officers of the departments. Depending on contract value, procurement exercises at a higher value may warrant scrutiny by the GLD Tender Board or the Central Tender Board to ensure compliance.

  In addition, we have put in place other measures to monitor departments' procurement work. Currently, departments should conduct biennial self-assessments to enhance staff awareness of compliance with procurement regulations and strengthen self-monitoring. As a third-party audit, GLD has also set up a dedicated team to conduct random on-site inspection of departments' procurement records from time to time. Over the past three years, GLD has inspected more than 100 procurement cases per year on average, and suggested improvement measures for specific cases.

  We acknowledge the importance of continuously enhancing the professional knowledge and execution abilities of procurement staff. Therefore, GLD regularly organises seminars and training courses. Over the past three years, GLD has organised more than 20 training activities in total, with over 1 600 attendances.

  We are also committed to fostering digitalisation. The Government's digitalised tendering system, commissioned starting from 2009, gradually enables suppliers to access tender notices, download tender documents, make tender submissions, and access notices of contract award, etc, online. We will continue to keep pace with the times and explore introducing technology in procurement work or monitoring procedures, thereby stepping up procurement efficiency.

  In terms of performance evaluation and contract management, departments take into account tenderers' track records in tender evaluation. As stipulated in the prevailing standard contract terms, the Government has the right to disqualify tenderers with previous significant or persistent contract defaults. After contract award, departments should evaluate contractors' performance regularly, and take actions in accordance with contract terms in case of unsatisfactory performance, such as issuance of warnings, suspension of payments, deduction from contract deposit, and even contract termination.

  The Government has been maintaining high transparency of procurement information. The public can access tender notices, contract award information, major procurement forecasts, and standard contract terms, etc, online.

  Having convened its first meeting in late August, the task force (Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime) will put forward enhancement proposals with a focus on aspects such as due diligence, tender requirements, contract management, and quality assurance.

(3) As regards the Hon Shang's question on public organisations, public organisations may devise their own procurement regimes based on their needs. The Hospital Authority and the Hong Kong Housing Authority have devised respective procurement regulations or guidelines for their staff to follow, and have organised regular training courses for them. The Government will share our best practices with public organisations from time to time, so as to ensure proper use of public resources.

  Thank you, President."
​立法會二題：打擊非法勞工,2025-09-10 12:56,2025-09-10 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000360.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上邵家輝議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的答覆：

問題：

據報本港多個行業出現黑工問題，包括有持商務簽注旅客來港非法工作，以及有企業透過跨境電商平台等渠道低價招攬生意，然後安排持「一簽多行」個人遊簽注人士來港提供服務，有關情況影響本地工人生計，並對本港企業造成不公平競爭。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計自去年十二月以來，每月有多少名持個人遊簽注人士不尋常地頻繁訪港（例如在一周內有四至五個平日來港）；當局有否主動了解他們的訪港目的；過去兩年，每月有多少名持商務簽注旅客因非法工作被捕，並按工作種類以表列出分項數字；

（二）會否考慮推出打擊黑工新措施，例如實行舉報黑工獎賞制度，以及加強向公眾宣傳，若服務提供者僱用黑工，顧客亦有機會負上刑責及就意外事故賠償；及

（三）會否與內地當局加強合作打擊黑工，包括清除內地網上平台上涉及非法來港提供服務的資訊、刪除違規帳號、加重涉及黑工罪行的刑罰，以及提醒內地居民來港非法工作的刑責，以免其誤信錯誤資訊？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直致力打擊非法勞工，從而保障本地勞工的就業機會。從事非法工作屬嚴重罪行，非法勞工、僱主，以及協助和教唆他人從事非法工作的人士均會根據《入境條例》被檢控。

根據入境事務處（入境處）的紀錄，由二○二三年至今年八月被捕的非法勞工中，約一半來自內地，其餘包括非華裔非法入境者或逾期逗留者，及外籍家庭傭工等。期間，持商務簽注或「一簽多行」個人遊簽注來港而因非法工作被捕的內地人士，分別約佔持該類簽注訪港旅客總數的十萬分之二和十萬分之一。

就邵議員的提問，經諮詢入境處、警務處及勞工處，現回覆如下：

（一）以商務簽注或「一簽多行」個人遊簽注訪港的內地旅客，在香港的身分均為訪客。一般而言，訪客不得在香港從事有薪或無薪的工作。

二○二三年至今年八月，持商務簽注來港而因非法工作被捕的月均人數為0.7。自去年十二月恢復和擴展深圳「一簽多行」個人遊簽注後至今年八月，持「一簽多行」個人遊簽注來港而因非法工作被捕的月均人數為4.1。被捕人士主要從事與建造、餐飲和零售批發有關的工作。

入境處一直嚴格把關，在入境審查時會對不尋常地頻繁來港的訪客作個別評估，以識別其訪港目的是否有可疑，並因應情況拒絕他們入境或縮短其留港日數。如有需要，入境處會根據情報於管制站加強抽查個別目標群組。入境處沒有備存提問要求的其他分項數字。

（二）及（三）政府一直採取多管齊下的策略打擊非法勞工，包括加強情報收集和嚴格執法、加強罰則、加強與內地當局合作，以及加強宣傳教育。

（i）加強情報收集和嚴格執法

各執法部門一直主動搜集情報，對懷疑有非法工作的場所進行聯合行動。今年第三季至今，入境處打擊非法勞工的執法行動達3 500次，月均數字較第二季增加約百分之十八。單以八月計，入境處聯同其他相關部門在多區展開反黑工工作，巡查超過1 800個地點，共拘捕了173名非法勞工和67名僱主，並大力宣傳以收阻嚇之效。

另外，入境處亦持續進行網上巡邏。如發現有人利用社交平台等安排非法勞工來港工作，會以「放蛇」方式執法。例如，入境處近日透過網上巡邏留意到有內地攝影師及化妝師利用社交平台宣傳，聲稱可以在香港提供服務。入境處經調查及採取「放蛇」行動後，合共拘捕10人，包括八名內地非法勞工。

與此同時，自今年初警務處於針對「白牌車」的執法行動中，共拘捕了八名非法勞工，及以串謀詐騙等罪名拘捕了11名涉嫌協助非法勞工透過網約車平台非法在港工作的人士。

此外，勞工處的勞工督察亦會繼續於日常巡查工作場所執行勞工法例時，根據《入境條例》賦予的權力，查核在工作場所內工作人士的身分證明文件，以及僱主備存的僱傭紀錄。如發現懷疑非法工作的個案，會轉介執法機構跟進。

（ii）加強罰則

政府於二○二一年修訂《入境條例》，增加了對僱主僱用受禁僱員的刑罰，最高刑罰由原來的罰款35萬元和監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款50萬元和監禁十年。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。入境處會密切留意法庭的判刑，有需要時會因應個案諮詢法律意見，考慮是否就判刑提出覆核。

（iii）與內地當局合作

警務處和入境處與內地相關部門設有互通機制，並一直保持聯繫及情報交流。

按照現行的通報機制，入境處會定期向內地相關部門提供在香港因刑事罪行被定罪的內地人士資料，包括從事非法工作的內地人士。內地當局視乎情況，一般在兩至五年內都不會向相關人士簽發赴港簽注，防止他們再次來港從事違法活動。另外，入境處如發現有人利用內地網上平台涉嫌安排非法勞工來港工作，會與內地當局交換情報，並促請內地當局與相關平台作適當跟進，例如要求「下架」涉事帖文。

（iv）宣傳教育

政府一直積極透過不同的渠道進行宣傳教育，包括新聞發布會、社交媒體、宣傳單張等，讓市民明白僱用非法勞工的刑責。另外，當發生意外時，或會因涉及非法勞工而影響相關保險效力。入境處亦主動提醒市民作為顧客如明知而透過服務提供者僱用非法勞工為其提供服務，亦有可能要負上刑責。

同時，入境處積極透過香港及內地居民常用的社交媒體，例如小紅書、微博、Instagram等的官方帳號，發放最新反非法勞工行動的執法成效及「聘用非法員工即屬違法」的信息，以助本地市民及內地訪客更容易接收相關資訊。

非法勞工是大眾關注的議題，市民一直積極舉報。目前，入境處設有舉報專線及網上舉報平台。入境處將會開拓更多渠道，例如微信及「智方便」應用程式，以完善非法勞工舉報機制，並不時檢視成效。

政府會繼續採取更多不同措施加大力度打擊非法勞工，以保障本地勞工。"
LCQ2: Combating illegal workers,2025-09-10 12:56,2025-09-10 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000361.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Shiu Ka-fai and a reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (Sep 10):

Question:

 As reported, the problem of illegal workers has emerged in many industries in Hong Kong, including illegal employment involving visitors holding an ""endorsement for business visit"" in Hong Kong, and enterprises' solicitation of business by offering a low price through channels such as cross-border e-‍commerce platforms and their subsequent arrangement for the provision of services in Hong Kong by holders of an ""endorsement for individual visit"" that allows multiple entries. The situation concerned has affected the livelihood of local workers and caused unfair competition to local enterprises. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the monthly number of holders of an ""endorsement for individual visit"" with unusually frequent visits to Hong Kong (such as travelling to Hong Kong for four to five weekdays a week) since December last year; whether the authorities have taken the initiative to ascertain their purpose of visiting Hong Kong; of the number of visitors holding an ""endorsement for business visit"" who have been arrested for illegal employment in each month of the past two years, with a tabulated breakdown by type of employment;

(2) whether it will consider the introduction of new measures to combat illegal workers, such as implementing a reward system for reporting illegal workers, and enhancing publicity for the general public that if a service provider employs illegal workers, the customer may also have to bear criminal liability and offer compensation in case of accidents or incidents; and

(3) whether it will strengthen co-operation with the Mainland authorities in combating illegal workers, including eliminating information involving travelling to Hong Kong and providing services against the law from online platforms on the Mainland, removing non-compliant accounts, stepping up the penalty for offences involving illegal workers, and reminding Mainland residents of the criminal liability for engaging in illegal employment in Hong Kong, so as to prevent them from mistakenly believing in erroneous information?

Reply:

President,

 The Government is committed to combating illegal employment so as to protect job opportunities for the local workforce. It is a serious offence to engage in illegal employment. Illegal workers, employers, as well as aiders and abettors of illegal employment will be liable to prosecution in accordance with the Immigration Ordinance.

 According the record of the Immigration Department (ImmD), of the illegal workers arrested from 2023 up to August this year, around half of them were from Mainland, while the remaining included non-ethnic Chinese illegal immigrants or overstayers, and foreign domestic helpers, etc. During the said period, about two in a hundred thousand of all Mainland visitors entering Hong Kong with business visit endorsements were arrested for illegal employment while the relevant figure for Mainland visitors with multiple-entry individual visit endorsements was about one in a hundred thousand.

 In consultation with the ImmD, the Hong Kong Police Force (the Police) and the Labour Department (LD), the reply to the question raised by the Hon Shiu Ka-fai is as follows:

(1) Mainland travellers entering Hong Kong with business visit endorsements or multiple-entry individual visit endorsements are regarded as visitors in Hong Kong. In general, visitors shall not take up any employment, whether paid or unpaid, in Hong Kong.

 From 2023 to August this year, the monthly average number of persons entering Hong Kong with business visit endorsements who were arrested for illegal employment was 0.7. Since the resumption and expansion of multiple-entry individual visit endorsements for Shenzhen in December last year to August this year, the monthly average number of persons entering Hong Kong with such endorsements who were arrested for illegal employment was 4.1. These arrested persons were primarily engaged in work relating to the construction, catering and retail/wholesale sectors.

 The ImmD has all along been performing its gatekeeping role diligently. During immigration examination, the ImmD will conduct individual assessment on visitors with unusually frequent visits to Hong Kong in order to identify persons with doubtful purpose of visit. Depending on circumstances, the ImmD will refuse their entry or shorten their stay in Hong Kong. Where necessary, the ImmD will step up spot checks at control points targeting specific groups based on intelligence. The ImmD does not maintain other breakdown figures requested in the question.

(2) and (3) The Government has been adopting a multi-pronged strategy to combat illegal employment, including stepping up intelligence collection and strict law enforcement, increase in penalty, collaboration with Mainland authorities, as well as publicity and education.

(i) Stepping up intelligence collection and strict law enforcement

 Various law enforcement agencies have been proactively collecting intelligence and conducting joint operations to raid premises suspected of having illegal employment activities. Since the third quarter this year and up till now, the ImmD has carried out 3 500 enforcement actions for combating illegal employment, the monthly average increased by around 18 per cent over that of the second quarter. In August alone, the ImmD, in collaboration with relevant departments, mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations during which over 1 800 locations were inspected, and a total of 173 illegal workers and 67 employers were arrested. These operations were also widely publicised to achieve a deterrent effect.

 In addition, the ImmD conducts constant cyber patrols. It will take enforcement action by decoy operation against any person who is found using social media platforms, etc to arrange for illegal workers to work in Hong Kong. For example, the ImmD recently noticed through cyber patrols that some Mainland photographers and make-up artists were promoting on social media platforms that they could provide services in Hong Kong. After investigation, the ImmD conducted enforcement actions and arrested a total of 10 persons, including eight Mainland illegal workers.

 Meanwhile, during the enforcement actions against illegal hire car services taken by the Police since early this year, a total of eight illegal workers were arrested, and 11 persons alleged to have assisted illegal workers to engage in illegal employment in Hong Kong through online car hailing platforms were arrested for offences such as conspiracy to defraud.

 Besides, the labour inspectors of the LD will, under the power conferred by the Immigration Ordinance, continue to check the proof of identity of employees on site and records of employees kept by employers during regular workplace inspections. Suspected cases of illegal employment will be referred to law enforcement agencies for follow-up.

(ii) Increase in penalty

 The Government amended the Immigration Ordinance in 2021 by increasing the penalty on employing prohibited employees. The maximum penalty was significantly increased from the original fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and ten years' imprisonment. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence. The ImmD will pay close attention to sentences imposed by the courts, and where necessary, seek legal advice in considering whether to apply for a sentence review based on the case.

(iii) Collaboration with Mainland authorities

 The Police and the ImmD have established a reciprocal notification mechanism with the relevant Mainland authorities, and have always maintained liaison and intelligence exchange with them.

 Under the existing notification mechanism, the ImmD will regularly pass information on Mainland residents who have been convicted of criminal offences in Hong Kong, including those engaging in illegal employment, to relevant Mainland authorities. Depending on the circumstances, the Mainland authorities will not issue exit endorsements to such persons for a period of two to five years in general, in order to prevent them from revisiting Hong Kong for illegal activities. In addition, if anyone is found to have allegedly arranged for illegal workers to work in Hong Kong using Mainland online platforms, the ImmD will exchange intelligence with the Mainland authorities and urge them to arrange with the relevant platforms for taking appropriate follow-up actions, such as taking down the posts involved.

(iv) Publicity and education

 The Government has been actively conducting publicity and education through various channels, including press conferences, social media, promotional leaflets, etc, to enable the public to understand the criminal liability for employing illegal workers. Besides, in case of accidents involving any illegal workers, the validity of the relevant insurance policy may be affected. The ImmD also proactively reminds members of the public that customers may also be held criminally liable if they knowingly employ illegal workers via any service providers to offer services for them.

 Meanwhile, the ImmD actively disseminates information on the effectiveness of the latest enforcement operations against illegal employment and the message of ""Employing Illegal Workers is an Offence"" through its official accounts of social media platforms frequently used by Hong Kong and Mainland residents such as Xiaohongshu, Weibo and Instagram. This can facilitate easier access to the relevant information by local residents and Mainland visitors.

 Illegal employment is an issue of public concern. Members of the public have been actively making such reports to the authorities. Currently, the ImmD provides dedicated reporting hotline and online reporting platform. The ImmD will explore more channels (such as WeChat and ""iAM Smart"" application) so as to further enhance the reporting mechanism for illegal workers, and will review the effectiveness from time to time.

 The Government will continue to adopt a wider range of measures to step up efforts in combating illegal workers with a view to protecting the local workforce."
立法會九題：酒店房租稅,2025-09-10 12:52,2025-09-10 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000309.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上姚柏良議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

政府在本年一月一日起恢復徵收酒店房租稅，稅率為房租的百分之三。然而，有酒店和賓館業界人士認為，由於經營成本不斷上升及周邊市場競爭激烈，加上旅客對酒店價格的敏感度大幅提高，政府應持續關注和評估重徵酒店房租稅對業界的影響。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計，本年一月至六月每月香港的酒店及賓館的以下資料：（i）酒店及賓館數目和（ii）其所提供的房間總數（按有否繳付酒店房租稅列出），以及（iii）政府所徵收的酒店房租稅金額（以表列出）；

（二）有否統計，第（一）項所述的不需繳付酒店房租稅的房間中，有多少間是屬於長期住房（按月以表列出）；

（三）有否檢視恢復徵收酒店房租稅後的徵收情況是否符合預期，以及如何評估恢復徵稅對香港酒店競爭力的影響；

（四）據悉當局表示酒店房租稅並不屬酒店房價的一部分，並曾促請網上旅遊平台（平台）不要以包含該稅項的房價為基礎計算向酒店及賓館收取的佣金，當局有否統計現時有多少間平台仍以含稅房價計算有關佣金；當局有何措施推動平台以不含稅房價為基礎計算佣金；

（五）會否考慮引入電子申報方式，以便利酒店及賓館申報酒店房租稅，從而減少業界的行政工作；

（六）有否計劃善用酒店房租稅稅收，推動酒店及賓館的升級轉型，以提升業界的競爭力；如有，計劃詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（七）鑑於有酒店業界人士認為，行業正面對激烈的競爭，建議政府調低或停徵酒店房租稅，政府會否考慮有關建議；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席︰

酒店房租稅是根據《酒店房租稅條例》（第348章）（《條例》）對酒店和賓館徵收的稅項。政府由二○二五年一月一日起恢復徵收酒店房租稅，稅率為百分之三，作為政府財政整合計劃的一部分。

＾不包括由相同住客在同一酒店或賓館住宿不少於連續28晚，被視作長期住房的房間。酒店或賓館無須就相關房租繳付酒店房租稅。由於酒店或賓館無須就其長期住房的資料向稅務局申報，因此稅務局沒有備存有關資料。

＃包括《條例》豁免繳納房租稅的酒店或賓館，即（a）房租的租金低於每日15元；（b）住房是由以非牟利性質成立和經營的社團所提供；或（c）酒店或賓館通常可供客人入住的房間不足10間。

根據《條例》，酒店房租稅按季徵收，酒店及賓館東主須在每季結束後的14天內向稅務局繳交須繳的稅項。政府就二○二五第一季和第二季所收取的酒店房租稅金額分別約為1.9億元和1.7億元。

（三）自公布恢復徵收酒店房租稅以來，政府一直與酒店及賓館業界代表保持緊密溝通，透過會面、簡介會及溝通平台，協助業界充分了解酒店房租稅的運作安排，並在制定執行細節時，吸納業界的意見。稅務局持續更新網上相關資料及常見問答、設立電話專線及在稅務中心設立服務台，為業界、市民及旅客提供資訊。稅務局亦不時派員到訪酒店及賓館，了解業界在填寫酒店房租稅申報表及繳稅時遇到的問題，以提供協助及解說。據我們了解，現時業界在填寫申報表及繳稅方面沒有重大困難，政府徵收酒店房租稅的工作亦大致暢順。

在稅收方面，二○二五年首兩季所徵收的酒店房租稅佔全年預算的9.7億元約百分之三十七。根據過往資料，酒店下半年的入住率一般比上半年高，而酒店房租稅亦會隨房租的調整而改變，因此本財政年度酒店房租稅的最終收入將視乎全年過夜旅客人數及房租而定。

政府在研究恢復徵收酒店房租稅時，已充分考慮稅項對旅客及業界的影響。酒店房租稅佔酒店／賓館房租僅百分之三，並以從價方式徵收。由於有關稅項只佔過夜旅客在港消費的一小部分，我們認為不會影響旅客來港意欲。根據香港旅遊發展局（旅發局）的統計數字，二○二五年上半年的平均酒店入住率及過夜旅客人次比二○二四年同期分別上升約百分之二及百分之七。事實上，旅客選擇旅遊目的地時會考慮多方面因素，包括有關地方的吸引力。政府會繼續豐富香港的旅遊產品和體驗，開拓更多具特色的旅遊路線，舉辦不同類型的盛事活動，以及鼓勵酒店跟景點及活動主辦商聯乘提供住宿套票及優惠等，以吸引更多旅客來港並多留幾天。

（四）政府在恢復徵收酒店房租稅前，已經與網上旅遊平台（平台）界別會面，並向他們發電郵解釋酒店房租稅的運作安排，包括闡明如平台代收酒店房租稅，在計算向酒店及賓館收取的佣金時，不應將稅款計算在內。主流平台在與酒店及賓館處理佣金問題時均遵從政府建議。

（五）為了進一步提升工作效率和方便市民及業界繳稅，稅務局一直善用資訊科技以完善服務。稅務局正積極探討優化現時酒店房租稅的申報方式，包括使用電子報稅，以減少業界的行政工作。

（六）一如其他稅收，酒店房租稅會撥歸政府一般收入。政府會視乎不同政策範疇的實際需要，整體考慮如何將資源按審慎理財的原則作適當分配。

政府一直全力推動旅遊業和酒店／賓館業的整體發展。政府於二○二五至二六財政年度投入逾12.3億元重點發展旅遊業，落實「無處不旅遊」的理念和《香港旅遊業發展藍圖2.0》，透過多項措施吸引旅客訪港，包括舉辦及支援盛事在港舉行、優化海濱設施、促進會展及獎勵旅遊、支持郵輪發展、並加強對中東及東盟旅客的推廣，同時推動智慧旅遊及優化平台以提升旅客體驗。政府會持續投入資源，透過旅發局加強宣傳，提升香港對旅客的吸引力。

（七）政府在制訂任何收入措施時，會考慮香港的經濟情況及發展需要、社會各界的意見，以及政府的財政情況。酒店房租稅能為政府提供穩定的收入來源，同時亦不會對普羅市民造成影響。政府現時暫無計劃調整酒店房租稅稅率。"
LCQ9: Hotel accommodation tax,2025-09-10 12:52,2025-09-10 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000314.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Yiu Pak-leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  The Government has resumed the collection of hotel accommodation tax (HAT) at a rate of 3 per cent on the accommodation charges with effect from January 1 this year. However, some members of the hotel and guesthouse industry are of the view that, given the rising operating costs, fierce competitions from the nearby markets and the significantly heightened sensitivity to hotel accommodation charges among visitors, the Government should continue to pay attention to and assess the impact of reinstating HAT on the industry. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the following information regarding hotels and guesthouses in Hong Kong in each month from January to June this year: (i) the number of hotels and guesthouses and (ii) the total number of rooms provided (broken down by whether or not HAT has been charged), as well as (iii) the amount of HAT collected by the Government (set out in a table);

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the number of rooms which are considered as long-term accommodations among those set out in (1) ‍on which HAT is not charged (set out in a table on a monthly basis);

(3) whether it has reviewed if the collection of HAT after its reinstatement meets expectations, and how it assesses the impact of reinstating HAT on the competitiveness of hotels in Hong Kong;

(4) as it is learnt that the authorities have indicated that HAT is not part of the hotel room tariffs, and they have urged online travel platforms (OTP(s)) not to calculate the commissions payable by hotels and guesthouses based on the room rates with HAT, whether the authorities have compiled statistics on the number of OTPs which are still calculating the commissions concerned based on the tax-loaded room rates at present; of the measures put in place by the authorities to promote OTPs to calculate commissions based on the room rates without HAT;

(5) whether it will consider introducing electronic filing of documents to facilitate hotels and guesthouses in making returns in respect of their payable HAT, thereby reducing the administrative workload of the industry;

(6) whether it has plans to make good use of the HAT revenue to promote the upgrading and transformation of hotels and guesthouses to enhance competitiveness of the industry; if so, of the details of the plans; if not, the reasons for that; and

(7) since some members of the hotel industry are of the view that they are facing intense competition and have proposed reduction or suspension of the collection of HAT by the Government, will the Government consider such proposals; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The hotel accommodation tax (HAT) is imposed on hotels and guesthouses under the Hotel Accommodation Tax Ordinance (Cap. 348) (the Ordinance). The Government resumed the collection of HAT at a rate of 3 per cent with effect from January 1, 2025, as part of its comprehensive fiscal consolidation programme.

  Upon consultation with the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), my reply to Hon Yiu Pak-leung's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) The number of hotels and guesthouses in Hong Kong and the total number of rooms provided by them from January to June 2025 are as follows:

^ Excluding rooms occupied by the same guest(s) in the same hotel/guesthouse for not less than 28 consecutive nights, which are regarded as long-term accommodation. Hotels or guesthouses are not required to pay HAT for the relevant accommodation charges. Since hotels or guesthouses are not required to report information of long-term accommodation to the IRD, the IRD does not maintain relevant information.

# Including hotels or guesthouses exempted from paying HAT under the Ordinance, i.e. (a) the rate of the accommodation charge is less than $15 per day; (b) the accommodation is provided by society not established or conducted for profit; or (c) the hotel or guesthouse contains less than 10 rooms normally available for lodging guests.

  Under the Ordinance, HAT is levied quarterly and hotel and guesthouse proprietors should pay the tax to the Government within 14 days after quarter-end. The HAT collected by the Government for the first and second quarters of 2025 amounted to about $190 million and $170 million respectively.

(3) Since the announcement of resumption of collection of HAT, the Government has maintained close communication with the representatives of the hotel and guesthouse industry. We assisted the industry in understanding the operational arrangement of HAT through meetings, briefings and a communication platform, and incorporated the industry's feedback when formulating the implementation details. The IRD has updated the relevant information and frequently asked questions on their website from time to time, and set up a telephone enquiry hotline and a dedicated helpdesk at the Inland Revenue Centre to provide information to the industry, general public and visitors. The IRD also visits hotels and guesthouses from time to time to see if the industry has any problems in completing the returns and making tax payments, and to provide assistance and clarifications. We understand that the industry has no major difficulties in completing the returns and making tax payment. The Government's work on HAT collection has been generally smooth.

  In terms of tax revenue, the HAT collected for the first two quarters of 2025 accounts for around 37 per cent of the annual estimate of $970 million. According to past data, the hotel occupancy rates in the second half of the year are generally higher than those in the first half. Furthermore, the HAT that can be collected varies with adjustments in room rates. Hence, the final revenue from HAT for this financial year will depend on the total number of overnight visitors and room rates throughout the year.

  The Government fully took into account the impact of the tax on visitors and the industry when considering the resumption of collection of HAT. HAT only constitutes 3 per cent of hotel/guesthouse room rates and is levied on an ad valorem basis. Since the relevant tax only accounts for a small portion of the total spending of overnight visitors in Hong Kong, we do not consider that it will affect visitors' wish to consider Hong Kong as a travel destination. According to the statistics of the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB), the average hotel occupancy rate and the number of overnight visitors for the first half of 2025 increased by around 2 per cent and 7 per cent respectively, compared to the same period in 2024. In fact, visitors take into account multiple factors when selecting travel destinations, including the appeal of the relevant places. The Government will continue to enrich Hong Kong's tourism products and experiences, develop distinctive travel itineraries, host different types of mega events and encourage hotels to collaborate with attractions and event organisers to provide accommodation packages and special offers, with a view to attracting more visitors to Hong Kong and extend their stays.

(4) Prior to the resumption of collection of HAT, the Government met with representatives from online travel agencies (OTAs) and issued emails to them to explain the operational arrangement of HAT. We clarified that, if OTAs collect HAT on behalf of the hotels or guesthouses, the tax amount should not be included in the calculation of commissions charged to hotels and guesthouses. Mainstream OTAs have followed the Government's appeal when handling the commissions with hotels and guesthouses.

(5) To further enhance operational efficiency and facilitate tax payments by the public and industries, the IRD has been making good use of information technology to improve their services. The IRD is actively exploring ways to improve the current filing process of HAT, including electronic filing, to reduce the administrative work of the industry.

(6) Similar to other taxes, HAT forms part of the Government's general revenue. The Government will consider the actual needs of different policy areas and holistically consider how to allocate resources in accordance with the principle of prudent financial management.

  The Government is fully committed to promoting the overall development of the tourism industry and hotel/guesthouse industry. In a bid to pursue the concept of ""tourism is everywhere"" and implement the Development Blueprint for Hong Kong's Tourism Industry 2.0, the Government has allocated over $1.23 billion in 2025-26 financial year to prioritise tourism development. An array of measures will be implemented to attract visitors, which include hosting and supporting mega events in Hong Kong, enhancing harbourfront facilities, facilitating meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions tourism, supporting cruise development, stepping up publicity targeting Middle Eastern and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) visitors, as well as promoting smart tourism and refining the platform to enhance visitors' experiences. The Government will continue allocating resources to strengthen its promotional efforts through the HKTB, thereby boosting Hong Kong's appeal to visitors.

(7) In formulating any revenue measures, the Government will take into account the economic situation and development needs of Hong Kong, views from different sectors of the community and the Government's fiscal situation. The HAT provides a stable source of Government revenue without affecting members of the public. The Government currently has no plan to adjust the HAT rate."
立法會二十題：交椅洲人工島填海工程項目,2025-09-10 12:50,2025-09-10 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000384.htm,"​以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上盧偉國議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

特區政府早前表示，政府會先集中精力，全力加速推進北部都會區建設，而推展交椅洲人工島填海工程項目（交椅洲項目）的速度則可作放緩，但當局仍會切實做好研究階段的各項必要準備工作。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府就二○二五至二○二六財政年度開支預算回覆本會議員問題時表示，土木工程拓展署正檢視及調整交椅洲項目環境影響評估報告中的相關背景資料及項目描述，並會適時展示該報告供公眾查閱，相關工作的最新進展為何；

（二）政府目前就交椅洲項目正進行哪些研究工作，以確保日後在適當時機可以迅速啟動該項目的建造工程；及

（三）目前有否就交椅洲項目制訂發展時間表；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

造地需時，涉及各方面的規劃和研究，以及進行不同的土地和基建工程。政府有責任未雨綢繆，以長遠目光主導土地發展，確保有充足的土地可適時供應，以支持香港的長遠經濟發展和民生所需。政府亦深知，土地供應必須循序漸進，務實推進，並參考包括市場經濟狀況等一籃子因素。經深思熟慮相關因素後，政府在今年初公開表示，目前會聚焦發展北部都會區，而交椅洲人工島（交椅洲）項目作為另一個大型土地發展計劃的優次則較低，但政府會繼續進行交椅洲項目已開展的研究。

就盧偉國議員提問的各部分，現回覆如下：

（一）交椅洲項目現時處於前期規劃和研究階段，土木工程拓展署（土拓署）於去年十二月三十一日向環境保護署（環保署）提交項目當中有關填海工程的環境影響評估報告（環評報告）。雖然環保署隨後通知土拓署該環評報告適合供公眾人士查閱，但基於交椅洲項目的推展時間會放緩並且還未有具體安排，發展局經檢視情況後認為現階段不宜繼續推進有關的法定環評程序（包括公眾查閱、向環境諮詢委員會提交環評報告及環保署署長考慮批准環評報告），這是考慮到在未有目標填海時間表的情況下進行該程序，可能令討論難以聚焦，亦可能引起公眾擔心審批結果經過一段時間後是否仍然適用。為免引起公眾對交椅洲項目不必要的揣測及爭論，我們認為適宜待填海工程的推展時間表大致確定並按當時需要更新該環評報告後，才向環保署提交並按程序適時展示供公眾查閱及尋求審批，是較為穩妥的安排。

（二）交椅洲項目是長遠土地供應的來源，因此雖然項目未有明確的推展時間表，但現時進行的研究所得的分析和資料對日後繼續推進項目尤為重要，仍然適用和極具參考價值，有助在條件許可時提速啓動交椅洲項目。現時，政府會繼續完成已開展的研究，包括土地勘探、填海及主要交通基建的初步設計、土地發展相關的技術評估等的工作。縱使完成這些研究後，仍須進行其他研究，尤其是詳細的工程設計，方可有條件進入填海階段。然而，已開展的研究可為我們在適當時候啟動其他必要的準備工作奠定良好基礎。

（三）基於上文所述情況，政府目前沒有為交椅洲項目制定推展時間表，實際上填海工程亦未有條件於本屆政府任期內開展。"
立法會十一題：處理廢汽車輪胎,2025-09-10 12:30,2025-09-10 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000308.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上林素蔚議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為本港大量廢汽車輪胎被棄置在堆填區內是浪費資源，而將該等輪胎轉化為橡膠粉，並添加到傳統瀝青作鋪路物料（橡膠瀝青），既能處理廢輪胎和提升環保效益，亦可降低工務工程成本。此外，時任運輸及物流局局長在去年八月十七日的網誌中表示，路政署就應用橡膠瀝青鋪路的研究取得理想結果，並正研究更廣泛地應用該物料於道路維修工程。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）去年至今棄置於堆填區的廢汽車輪胎數量為何；

（二）過去三年，每年全港道路工程的瀝青物料的總耗用量，以及回收再造以作橡膠瀝青用途的廢輪胎數量為何；當局有否計劃全面採用橡膠瀝青鋪路，以及有否評估應用該物料鋪路的潛在減廢效益（包括全面採用該物料鋪路後每年可增加處理的廢輪胎數量）為何；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於根據路政署網頁資料，政府於今年四月起全面使用一種名為「高改性瀝青瑪蹄脂碎石混合料」的低噪音鋪路物料作鋪路用途，但該署亦表示現正實地測試橡膠瀝青以為日後應用該物料鋪路訂立準則，當局在決定選用何種鋪路物料時的主要考慮因素為何（例如是否包括技術和成本上的差異）？

答覆：

主席：

就林素蔚議員提問的各部分，經諮詢環境及生態局、環境保護署及路政署後，現回覆如下：

（一）二○二一年至二○二三年棄置於堆填區的車輛輪胎廢物總量表列如下：




年份
			（註一）
棄置於堆填區的車輛輪胎廢物總量
			（公噸）（註二）

2023
14300



註一︰二○二四年的相關統計數字仍在編製中
註二︰包括少量不能分類的其他輪胎

（二）及（三）橡膠瀝青是一種以廢舊輪胎製成的橡膠顆粒替代部分石油瀝青的鋪路物料。早前，路政署與學界共同研究及確立了將廢棄車胎橡膠粉加入傳統瀝青物料中的技術可行性。這項技術不僅為廢棄輪胎提供了回收再造的途徑，減少堆填區負擔，同時也可減少耗用不可再生的石油資源。在上述研究的實地試驗結束後，路政署已於二○二四年將橡膠瀝青鋪路物料納入道路維修合約內，作為道路維修時可選用的物料之一，並會因應路段實際需要和成本效益配合使用。

除使用傳統瀝青和橡膠瀝青作鋪路物料外，路政署亦持續研發及引入更耐用的瀝青物料，並自二○二五年四月一日起全面應用高改性瀝青物料於合適路段作鋪路之用，以進一步提升本港整體路面質素。

路政署在決定選用何種鋪路物料時，會根據相關道路的需要及鋪路物料的成本效益等因素，從傳統瀝青物料、橡膠瀝青物料，以及高改性瀝青物料當中，選用合適的鋪路物料。一般而言，傳統瀝青和橡膠瀝青應用於非繁忙的市區及郊區道路，而高改性瀝青物料會用於交通流量高的行車路段中。舉例來說，在高改性瀝青物料中，能有效減少輪胎路面噪音的「6毫米高改性瀝青瑪蹄脂碎石混合料」特別適用於鄰近民居的市區道路路面，而透水性高的「高改性瀝青多孔摩擦層」則多適用高速公路路面。

另一方面，鋪路物料的成本效益亦是選用何種鋪路物料時的重要準則。就傳統瀝青物料及橡膠瀝青物料而言，按路政署估算，由於以橡膠瀝青物料鋪路的整體工程成本（包括建造及維修保養）比以傳統瀝青物料鋪路顯著地高，而其耐用性亦不及高改性瀝青物料。因此，考慮到其成本效益，路政署現時會在部分非繁忙的市區及郊區道路的工程中使用橡膠瀝青物料鋪路。另外，就高改性瀝青物料而言，根據路政署估算，雖然使用高改性瀝青物料的整體工程成本略高於傳統瀝青物料，高改性瀝青物料具有更優異的耐用性，能夠減低路面維修的頻率及重鋪路面工程對公眾造成的不便，從而減少社會成本。隨着路政署全面應用高改性瀝青物料於合適路段作鋪路之用，其成本亦預計將逐步下降。

過去三年，在全港工務部門所進行的道路工程下，每年耗用的瀝青物料總量平均約為33萬公噸，其中橡膠瀝青物料總量平均約為5 000公噸，當中包含約25公噸廢汽車輪胎橡膠粉。

路政署會繼續密切留意關於路面物料的最新研究、開發及實踐經驗，並適時檢視不同瀝青物料的應用計劃（包括橡膠瀝青物料），以在提升路面質素的同時，為社會帶來更大的效益。"
LCQ11: Handling of waste vehicle tyres,2025-09-10 12:30,2025-09-10 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000323.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Lam So-wai and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

There are views that the disposal of large quantities of waste vehicle tyres at landfills in Hong Kong constitutes a waste of resources. Converting such tyres into rubber powder and adding it to conventional bitumin as a road paving material (rubberised bitumin) can facilitate the handling of waste tyres, enhance environmental benefits and also reduce costs of public works projects. In addition, in a blog post on August 17 last year, the then Secretary for Transport and Logistics, indicated that the Highways Department (HyD) had achieved satisfactory results in its research on the application of rubberised bitumin in road paving and was exploring the wider use of this material in road maintenance works. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of waste vehicle tyres disposed of at landfills since last year;

(2) of the total consumption of bituminous materials in road works across the territory and the quantity of waste tyres recycled for use in rubberised bitumin in each of the past three years; whether the authorities have plans to fully adopt rubberised bitumin for road paving, and whether an assessment has been conducted on the potential waste reduction benefits of using this material for road paving (including the additional quantity of waste tyres that could be handled annually after its full adoption); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) given that according to the information on the HyD's webpage, the Government has fully adopted a low noise road paving material called ""Highly Modified Stone Mastic Asphalt"" for road paving since April this year. However, the HyD has also stated that it has been conducting site trials on rubberised bitumin to formulate criteria for future application of this material in road paving, of the authorities' major considerations when deciding on the choice of road paving materials (e.g. whether technical and cost differences are included)?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Environment and Ecology Bureau, the Environmental Protection Department and the Highways Department (HyD), the reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Lam So-wai is as follows:

(1) The total volume of vehicle tyre waste disposed of at landfills from 2021 to 2023 is tabulated as follows:




Year
			(Note 1)
Volume of vehicle tyre waste disposed of at landfills (tonnes) (Note 2)


2021
19900


2022
16200


2023
14300



Note 1: Relevant statistics for 2024 are still under compilation
Note 2: The volume includes a small volume of other tyres which cannot be classified

(2) and (3) Rubberised bituminous material is a paving material that replaces part of petroleum-based bitumen with crumb rubber made from waste tyres. The HyD, in collaboration with academia, has earlier researched and confirmed the technical feasibility of incorporating crumb rubber from waste tyres into conventional bituminous materials. Not only does this technology provide a recycling pathway for waste tyres and reduce burden on landfills, but it also lowers the consumption of non-renewable petroleum resources. Following the completion of site trials for the aforementioned research, the HyD incorporated rubberised bituminous paving materials into road maintenance contracts in 2024 as one of the optional materials for road repairs. Its application will be determined based on the actual needs of road sections and cost-effectiveness considerations.

In addition to using conventional and rubberised bituminous materials as paving materials, the HyD continues to research, develop and introduce more durable bituminous materials. Starting April 1, 2025, highly modified bituminous materials have been fully adopted for paving on suitable road sections to further enhance the overall quality of road pavement in Hong Kong.

When determining which paving material to use, the HyD selects the appropriate material from among conventional, rubberised, and highly modified bituminous paving materials taking into account factors such as the specific needs of the road and the cost-effectiveness of the paving materials. In general, conventional and rubberised bituminous materials are used on non-busy urban and rural roads, while highly modified bituminous materials are applied to high-traffic road sections. For example, among highly modified bituminous materials, the ""6 mm Highly Modified Stone Mastic Asphalt"", which effectively reduces tyre-road noise, is particularly suitable for urban road surfaces near residential areas, while the highly permeable ""Highly Modified Friction Course"" is more commonly used for highway surfaces.

On the other hand, the cost-effectiveness of paving materials is also an important criterion in selecting which paving material to use. Regarding conventional and rubberised bituminous materials, according to HyD's estimates, the overall project cost (including that of construction and maintenance) of paving with rubberised bituminous material is significantly higher than that of conventional bituminous material and its durability is lower than that of highly modified bituminous materials. Therefore, considering its cost-effectiveness, the HyD currently uses rubberised bituminous material for paving in certain non-busy urban and rural road projects. Moreover, regarding highly modified bituminous materials, according to HyD's estimates, although the overall cost is slightly higher than that of conventional bituminous materials, their better durability reduces the frequency of road maintenance and minimises the inconvenience caused by road resurfacing works to the public, thereby lowering social costs. With the full adoption of highly modified bituminous materials for suitable road sections, their costs are expected to gradually decrease.

Over the past three years, the total annual consumption of bituminous materials in road projects undertaken by public works departments in Hong Kong averaged approximately 330 000 tonnes, of which the total amount of rubberised bituminous material accounted for an average of about 5 000 tonnes. This included about 25 tonnes of crumb rubber recycled from waste tyres.

The HyD will continue to keep abreast of the latest research, development, and practical experience related to road paving materials and review the application plans for different bituminous materials (including rubberised bituminous materials) in a timely manner to enhance road pavement quality while bringing greater benefits to society."
立法會一題：確保高齡職業司機的駕駛能力,2025-09-10 12:20,2025-09-10 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000334.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上管浩鳴議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

據報今年八月一名八旬的士司機在荃灣撞斃一名菲籍遊客，引起社會各界對高齡職業司機駕駛能力及安全的關注。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府至今仍未落實於二○二三年提出將商用車輛司機提交體格證明的年齡門檻降至65歲，以及「一年一檢」的建議，政府在落實該等建議上所面對的阻力為何，以及能否承諾具體的落實時間；

（二）鑑於有意見認為現時對駕駛執照申請人及持有人的體格證明要求和檢測項目過於簡單，未能確保高齡職業司機的健康狀況適宜駕駛，當局會否參考內地或台灣做法，檢討高齡職業司機的體檢要求，例如加入反應測試、慢性疾病篩查等更嚴格的檢測項目，並為醫生制訂詳細評估指引；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）會否參考內地、台灣地區或日本的做法，為職業司機訂立強制退休年齡；若會，詳情為何；若否，如何確保高齡職業司機的駕駛能力？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直重視司機的健康情況，明白駕駛人士的身體狀況對確保道路安全十分重要。隨着年長駕駛者人數逐漸增加，而商用車司機因其職業性質，相對承擔更高風險。因此，政府就《道路交通（駕駛執照）規例》（第374B章）（《規例》）對駕駛執照申請人或持有人體格證明的要求及機制進行檢討，進一步保障司機和其他道路使用者的安全。就管浩鳴議員提問的各部分，經諮詢運輸署，現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）現時，年滿70歲或以上人士在申請駕駛任何種類汽車的正式駕駛執照時，須提供一份由註冊醫生填寫及簽署的體格證明，以證明申請人的健康狀況宜於駕駛及控制該類車輛。視乎申請人的選擇，其駕駛執照有效期為一年或三年。《規例》亦訂明，如申請人患有《規例》附表1所指明的疾病或身體傷殘，運輸署署長須拒絕有關申請。

為提升道路安全，我們於二○二三年諮詢立法會交通事務委員會，建議提高商用車司機的體格證明要求。具體而言，政府建議修訂《規例》附表1，包括提高視覺能力的要求以涵蓋「視力」和「視野」，並就商用車司機增設適用項目，當中包括例如聽力要求，以提升有關要求。政府亦建議將商用車司機提交體格檢驗證明書的年齡門檻由70歲降低至65歲，並縮短其駕駛執照有效期至一年，即「一年一檢」方可續領牌照，而非商用車司機提交體格證明的要求則維持不變。

自諮詢立法會交通事務委員會後，我們持續聽取各界意見，近日亦再諮詢各持份者，包括立法會議員、運輸業界和醫學界等。社會整體支持上述方向，但有業界代表提出可否稍為放寬65歲至70歲之間的體格評估頻率，也有持份者認為應考慮增加要求司機進行反應測試，亦有醫學界代表指出要加強考慮前線醫生實務操作的情況。

因應上述較近期收集到的最新意見，運輸署委聘的香港大學顧問團隊和醫學專家小組，成員包括衞生署、醫院管理局和香港醫學專科學院及其他局和部門代表，正檢視和考慮微調《規例》附表1內所指明的疾病或身體傷殘項目，以及供醫生參考的醫療指引的內容，務求令指引更清晰、更客觀、更實用。

為確保前線醫生能充分掌握醫療指引的內容，以及日後如何進行體檢和填寫體格證明書的注意事項，同時提升商用車司機對健康的意識和對新的評估要求的理解，運輸署會參考海事處實施本地船隻操作人員健康證明要求與業界進行測試的經驗，提前在今年第四季邀請商用車業界人士參與體格評估試驗計劃，藉此收集和吸納前線醫生在實務操作方面的意見，檢視並優化整個流程。同時，在反應測試方面，我們會研究如何善用創新科技和人工智能，包括參考不同地區使用科技創新的經驗，以測試司機身體反應能力，或模擬路面情況和駕駛條件，以測試年長司機在不同情況下的駕駛反應。

具體時間表方面，我們正繼續同步積極進行法例草擬，並會進一步吸納顧問團隊和專家小組的意見，以及稍後業界和醫生參與的體格評估試驗計劃的經驗，從而在第四季敲定立法建議和醫療指引。我們計劃在明年首季向立法會交通事務委員會一併匯報結果，並向立法會提交有關的附屬法例修訂。運輸署會繼續籌備各項準備工作，包括為前線醫生製作示範短片等，爭取在明年第二季落實新的安排，提升整體道路安全水平。

（三）至於提問中為商用車司機設定退休年齡的意見，我們見到各地區的做法亦不盡相同。例如，澳洲、加拿大和英國沒有限制，內地則按年齡限制可駕駛的車種。我們認為體格評估有助預防疾病和建立健康的生活習慣。考慮到現時有近四成的士和小巴駕駛執照持有人年齡為65歲或以上，如一刀切設立退休年齡，難免對業界人手造成不必要的衝擊。政府現階段建議先加強商用車司機體格證明的要求，並會持續檢視推行的成效及予以優化。

多謝主席。"
LCQ1: Ensuring driving ability of elderly professional drivers,2025-09-10 12:20,2025-09-10 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000337.htm,"  Following is a question by Reverend Canon the Hon Peter Douglas Koon and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  It has been reported that in August this year, a taxi driver in his eighties struck and killed a Filipino tourist in Tsuen Wan, arousing concerns among various sectors in the community about the driving ability and safety of elderly professional drivers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the Government has yet to implement the proposals put forward in 2023 to lower the age threshold of commercial vehicle drivers submitting physical fitness certification to the age of 65 and to require them undergoing a medical examination once every year, of the resistance the Government encounters when implementing these proposals, and whether it can commit to a specific implementation timeline;

(2) as there are views that the current physical fitness certification requirements and the examination items for driving licence applicants and holders are overly simplistic and fail to ensure the fitness of elderly professional drivers for driving, whether the authorities will review the requirements for medical examination of elderly professional drivers by drawing reference from practices on the Mainland or Taiwan, such as introducing more stringent examination items, including reaction tests and screening for chronic diseases, as well as formulating detailed assessment guidelines for doctors; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it will draw on practices on the Mainland, Taiwan region or Japan to set a mandatory retirement age for professional drivers; if so, of the details; if not, how it will ensure the driving ability of elderly professional drivers?

Reply:

President,

  The Government has always attached importance to the health conditions of drivers and understands that the physical condition of drivers is of vital significance to ensuring road safety. With the increasing number of aged drivers, commercial vehicle drivers face relatively higher risks due to the nature of their profession. In this connection, the Government has conducted a review of the requirements and mechanism for medical certification of driving licence applicants or holders under the Road Traffic (Driving Licences) Regulations (Cap. 374B) (the Regulations) with a view to further safeguarding the safety of drivers and other road users. In consultation with the Transport Department (TD), the reply to the various parts of the question raised by Reverend Canon the Hon Peter Douglas Koon is as follows:

(1) and (2) Currently, when a person aged 70 or above applies for a full driving licence of any class of motor vehicle, he/she must provide a medical certificate completed and signed by a registered medical practitioner to prove that the applicant is medically fit to drive and control a vehicle in that class. Depending on applicants' choices, the validity period of such driving licences is one year or three years. The Regulations also stipulate that if an applicant is suffering from a disease or physical disability specified in the First Schedule to the Regulations, the Commissioner for Transport shall refuse the application.

  To improve road safety, we consulted the Legislative Council (LegCo) Panel on Transport in 2023, proposing to enhance the requirements for medical certification of commercial vehicle drivers. Specifically, the Government proposes amending the First Schedule to the Regulations, including raising the standards of eyesight to cover visual acuity and visual field, and adding items applicable to commercial vehicle drivers, including hearing requirements, to enhance the relevant requirements. The Government also proposes lowering the age threshold for commercial vehicle drivers to submit medical examination certificates from the age of 70 to that of 65. In addition, the validity period of their driving licences is proposed to be shortened to one year, meaning that an annual check-up is required before the licence can be renewed. Meanwhile, the requirements for non-commercial vehicles drivers to provide medical certification will remain unchanged.

  After consulting the LegCo Panel on Transport, we have kept listening to the views of all sectors. Recently, we have further consulted various stakeholders including LegCo Members, the transport trade and the medical sector, etc. While society as a whole supports the above direction, some trade representatives suggested relaxing the frequency of medical assessment for drivers aged between 65 and 70. Other stakeholders suggested that consideration should be given to requiring drivers to undergo reaction tests. Medical representatives have also pointed out the need to give greater consideration to the practical circumstances faced by frontline medical practitioners.

  In response to the latest opinions collected recently, the consultant team from the University of Hong Kong commissioned by the TD and the medical expert panel, comprising representatives from the Department of Health, the Hospital Authority, the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, and other bureaux and departments, are reviewing and considering to fine-tune the diseases or physical disabilities items specified in the First Schedule to the Regulations, as well as the content of the medical guidelines for medical practitioners' reference, with a view to making the guidelines clearer, more objective, and more practical.

  To ensure that frontline medical practitioners fully understand the contents of the medical guidelines and the points to note for conducting medical examination and completing medical certificates in the future, and to enhance commercial vehicle drivers' health awareness and their understanding of the new assessment requirements, the TD will make reference to the Marine Department's trial experience with the industry in introducing the medical fitness certificate requirement for local vessel operators, and will invite members of the commercial vehicle industry to participate in medical assessment trials ahead of schedule during the fourth quarter of this year. The trial aims to collect and incorporate practical feedback from frontline medical practitioners, thereby reviewing and enhancing the overall process. Meanwhile, as regards reaction tests, we will explore the utilisation of innovative technology and artificial intelligence, including drawing on the experiences in technological innovation across different regions to test the physical responsiveness of drivers, or to simulate various road situations and driving conditions so as to assess aged drivers' reactions under different circumstances.

  Regarding the specific timetable, we are continuing to actively pursue the law drafting in parallel and will further incorporate the views of the consultant team and the expert panel. We will also draw on the experience of medical assessment trials to be conducted shortly with the trade and medical practitioners with a view to finalising the legislative proposal and medical guidelines in the fourth quarter. We plan to report to the LegCo Panel on Transport the collective findings in the first quarter of next year, and submit the subsidiary legislation amendments to the LegCo. The TD will continue to carry out various preparatory work, including the production of demonstration video clips for frontline medical practitioners, and strive for the implementation of the new arrangement in the second quarter of next year to enhance overall road safety.

(3) As regards comments made in the question on setting a retirement age for commercial vehicle drivers, we notice that different regions have adopted various practices. For instance, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom impose no restrictions, whereas the Mainland imposes age restrictions on the types of vehicles that may be driven. We consider that medical assessment would help prevent illnesses and build healthy lifestyle habits. As currently nearly 40 percent of taxi and light bus driving licence holders are aged 65 or above, a blanket retirement age would inevitably disrupt the manpower in the trade. The Government proposes to first enhance the requirements for medical certification of commercial vehicle drivers at this stage, and will continue to review and enhance its effectiveness.

  Thank you, President."
立法會十五題：境外人士來港參加短期活動及受訓,2025-09-10 12:15,2025-09-10 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000302.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上陳祖恒議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉隨着香港推進「八大中心」的發展，越來越多境外人士參與在香港舉辦的活動。然而，在現時制度下境外人士受邀來港參加研討會、演講、簽約、實習等短期或單次性活動需要申請工作或受訓簽證，雖然政府推出的「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（短期訪客計劃）可為來港參與短期活動訪客提供入境便利，但該計劃只限於獲認可主辦機構邀請／保證來港的人士。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有業界人士反映，雖然根據入境事務處資料，審批來港就業、投資及受訓等簽證申請一般需時四星期，但其過往經驗顯示相關程序需時約六至八星期，更曾有嘉賓因簽證申請需時過久而致無法出席活動，當局會否考慮為來港參與短期或單次性活動的簽證申請訂定更明確的審批時間，以讓申請人和活動主辦機構能作出更準確的預算；

（二）至今透過短期訪客計劃來港參與指定短期活動的人數為何，並按該計劃所涵蓋的12個指定界別以下表列出分項數字；




指定界別
二○二二年
二○二三年
二○二四年
二○二五年至今


醫療衞生






高等教育






文化藝術






體育






文物






創意產業






創新及科技






香港桂冠論壇






航空






國際／大型活動






金融






發展與建築








（三）鑑於有意見認為，隨着越來越多盛事在港舉行，現時短期訪客計劃的認可主辦機構以法定機構及政府部門為主的做法難以應付發展需要，當局會否研究優化該計劃，例如按需要分階段擴大認可主辦機構清單至涵蓋商業機構，並要求該等機構簽署聲明承諾不會濫用機制，以及引入各行業的權威性機構協助當局審批簽證的工作，以切合八大中心的發展需要；及

（四）鑑於有意見認為，隨着越來越多內地企業通過香港「走出去」，將有很多內地居民需要來港培訓，當局會否考慮擴大「來港受訓」簽證的申請資格至涵蓋所有內地居民，以進一步提升本港協助企業「出海」的專業服務的競爭力？

答覆：

主席：

政府致力鞏固和持續發展香港在「十四五」規劃下的「八大中心」定位，確保香港的競爭力和經濟發展。就入境政策而言，入境事務處（入境處）在維持有效入境管制的同時亦一直提供便捷的出入境服務以方便真正的訪客，促進更多人才匯聚香港交流。

一般而言，訪客不得在港從事有薪或無薪的工作，他們可以簽訂合約、參與短期研討會或其他會議，亦可在不受酬的情況下發表演講等。入境處的網站載有訪客獲准參與的活動的相關資訊供公眾參考：www.immd.gov.hk/hkt/services/visas/permissible-activities.html。

為促進更多人才訪港交流，政府於二○二二年六月推出為期兩年的「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利先導計劃」（先導計劃），並於二○二四年六月把先導計劃恆常化為「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（短期訪客計劃）。在短期訪客計劃下，獲政府相關決策局／部門認可的機構可向界別內相關的非本地人才發出邀請信，獲邀人士可以訪客身分來港參與指定短期活動，而無須向入境處申請工作簽證／進入許可。他們每次來港可在不超過連續14個曆日期間參與指定短期活動，並可就該指定活動收取報酬。

就陳議員的提問，經諮詢入境處後，我現回覆如下：

（一）一般而言，就來港就業、投資及受訓的簽證／進入許可的所有申請，入境處在收齊所需文件後，會於四星期內完成申請審批。相關申請程序及所需時間已清晰載於入境處網站。在二○二四年，99%相關簽證／進入許可申請於收齊文件後四星期內完成審批。入境處亦會因應個別情況（例如在港舉辦的大型活動），在可行情況下加快有關簽證／進入許可申請的審批。

為提供更好服務以精益求精，入境處已將簽證／進入許可的申請全面電子化，並在網頁列出所需提交文件清單，讓申請人清楚了解並可預先準備好所需文件，減少需補交文件的機會。入境處會繼續透過優化程序提高效率。

（二）及（三）截至二○二五年六月底，先導計劃／短期訪客計劃已合共惠及36 951名非本地人才，便利他們以訪客身分來港參與各項短期盛事及活動，無須向入境處申請工作簽證／進入許可。按界別的統計數字載於附件。

為確保計劃與時並進，政府不時審視計劃的涵蓋範圍及運作機制，務求使計劃能夠在風險可控的前提下，持續有效地促進相關界別發展，並提升香港的國際形象。自先導計劃推出以來，政府分別兩次在二○二三年二月以及二○二四年六月擴大計劃，在原有10個指定界別外，增加「金融」及「發展與建築」兩個新界別，認可機構亦從計劃剛推出時約350個增加18%至現時的400多個，當中包括政府決策局／部門、公營／法定機構、專業組織和業界協會等。目前，計劃下設有機制，各參與的政策局／部門均會協助把關，確保計劃的執行持續符合政策目標。

如前述，目前短期訪客計劃在公營機構以外亦涵蓋專業組織和業界協會。商業機構亦可與計劃下的認可機構合作舉辦合資格的指定短期活動，以享相關入境便利。在考慮是否進一步放寬計劃時，政府必須考慮兩大原則，包括合資格根據計劃來港進行指定短期活動的人士不會取代本地勞動力，及不會構成濫用風險（包括非法就業）。政府會繼續留意短期訪客計劃的實施情況和相關部門及業界的意見，適時檢討計劃的涵蓋範圍，以期在入境管制與便利之間取得適當平衡。我們歡迎有興趣的商業機構主動與所屬界別的相關決策局／部門或認可機構聯絡並考慮合辦合資格的活動，以期促進計劃下更多不同形式的交流合作。

（四）來港受訓入境安排的實施，為有真正需要來港接受培訓的人士提供便利，讓他們在本港汲取知識、經驗或技能，同時有助促進和鞏固香港在協助包括內地企業「走出去」的角色。

目前，設於香港而有相當規模的公司的內地業務伙伴及／或於內地分部的僱員，可申請來港受訓。在二○二五年（截至七月），內地居民獲批來港受訓的月均數字為197宗，較二○二四年（月均194宗）稍微上升。

政府會繼續不時檢視來港受訓入境安排以確保該安排持續符合目標和香港的發展需要。"
LCQ15: Non-local people coming to Hong Kong to participate in short-term activities and receive training,2025-09-10 12:15,2025-09-10 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000310.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Sunny Tan and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

It is learnt that with Hong Kong advancing the development of the ""eight centres"", an increasing number of non-local people are participating in activities held in Hong Kong. However, under the current system, non-local people coming to Hong Kong at invitation to participate in short-‍term or one-off activities, such as seminars, talks, contract signings and internships, must apply for employment or training visas. Although the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (the STV Scheme) launched by the Government can provide immigration facilitation for visitors coming to Hong Kong to participate in short-term activities, the Scheme is only for persons invited/sponsored by authorised host organisations. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as some members of the industry have relayed that although the Immigration Department states the standard processing time for visa applications for employment, investment, training, etc. in Hong Kong is typically four weeks, their past experience shows that the relevant procedures take about six to eight weeks, and that there have even been instances where guests were unable to attend activities due to the unduly long time required for processing visa applications, whether the authorities will consider setting a more specific timeframe for processing visa applications for those coming to Hong Kong to participate in short-term or one-off activities, so as to enable applicants and activity organisers to make more accurate plans;

(2) of the up-to-date number of persons who have come to Hong Kong to participate in specified short-term activities through the STV Scheme, and set out in the table below a breakdown by the 12 designated sectors under the Scheme;




Designated sector
2022
2023
2024
2025 to date


Medical and Healthcare






Higher Education






Arts and Culture






Sports






Heritage






Creative Industries






Innovation and Technology






Hong Kong Laureate Forum






Aviation






International / Mega Events






Finance






Development and Construction








(3) as there are views that with an increasing number of mega events being held in Hong Kong, the current practice of having statutory bodies and government departments as the main authorised host organisations under the STV Scheme can hardly meet development needs, whether the authorities will consider optimising the Scheme, for example by phasing in the expansion of the list of authorised host organisations to include commercial organisations as necessary, requiring such organisations to sign declarations pledging not to abuse the mechanism, and enlisting authoritative organisations in various industries to assist the authorities in processing visa applications, so as to meet the development needs of the ""eight centres""; and

(4) as there are views that with more and more Mainland enterprises ""going global"" through Hong Kong, many Mainland residents will need to receive training in Hong Kong, whether the authorities will consider extending the eligibility criteria for visas to undergo training in Hong Kong to cover all Mainland residents, so as to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's professional services in assisting enterprises to expand overseas?

Reply:

President,

The Government is committed to consolidating and continuously enhancing Hong Kong's development of the ""eight centres"" as outlined in the 14th Five-Year Plan, providing impetus for sustaining our competitiveness and economic growth. In connection with immigration policies, the Immigration Department (ImmD) has been maintaining effective immigration control while providing convenient immigration services to facilitate genuine visitors so as to promote greater convergence of talents in Hong Kong for exchanges.

In general, visitors shall not take any employment, whether paid or unpaid, in Hong Kong. They may conclude contracts, attend short term seminars or other business meetings, and deliver speeches without remuneration. The ImmD's website contains relevant information on permissible activities for visitors for public reference: www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/permissible-activities.html.

To encourage more talents to come to Hong Kong for exchanges, the Government launched a two-year Pilot Scheme on Immigration Facilitation for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (Pilot Scheme) in June 2022, which was regularised as the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short term Activities in Designated Sectors (STV Scheme) in June 2024. Under the STV Scheme, organisations authorised by the relevant government bureaux/departments (B/Ds) can issue invitation letters to relevant non-local talents in their sectors. Invited persons may come to Hong Kong to participate in specified short-term activities as visitors without the need to apply for employment visas/entry permits from the ImmD. They may participate in specified short term activities for up to 14 consecutive calendar days during each trip to Hong Kong, and receive remuneration for the specified activities concerned.

In consultation with the ImmD, my reply to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Sunny Tan is as follows:

(1) In general, for all visa/entry permit applications for employment, investment and training in Hong Kong, the ImmD will complete processing within four weeks upon receipt of all required documents. The application procedures and processing times are clearly set out on ImmD's website. In 2024, 99 per cent of the relevant visa/entry permit applications could be completed within four weeks upon receipt of all required documents. The ImmD will also expedite the processing of relevant visa/entry permit applications as far as practicable, taking into account individual circumstances (e.g. applications related to mega events in Hong Kong).

To provide better services and strive for excellence, the ImmD has launched electronic services for visa/entry permit applications in full. A list setting out the required documents is also available on the ImmD's website to give applicants a clear picture of what is required for the application so that they can prepare the required documents in advance, thereby minimising the chance of submitting supplementary documents. The ImmD will continue to enhance efficiency through process optimisation.

(2) and (3) As of end-June 2025, the Pilot Scheme/STV Scheme had benefited a total of 36 951 non-local talents, facilitating their entry into Hong Kong as visitors to participate in various short-term events and activities without the need to apply for employment visas/entry permits from the ImmD. The statistics by sector are at Annex.

To ensure that the Scheme keeps pace with the times, the Government reviews its coverage and operation mechanism from time to time, with a view to ensuring that it can continue to effectively promote the development of relevant sectors and raise Hong Kong's international profile while ensuring that the risks are manageable. Since the launch of the Pilot Scheme, the Government has expanded the Scheme twice in February 2023 and June 2024, by adding two new sectors, namely ""Finance"" and ""Development and Construction"", to the original 10 designated sectors. The number of authorised organisations has also increased by 18 per cent from around 350 when the scheme was first launched, to more than 400 at present. These authorised organisations include government B/Ds, public/statutory organisations, professional bodies and industry associations, etc. At present, through an established mechanism, all participating B/Ds would assist in ensuring that the implementation of the scheme consistently meets policy objectives.

As mentioned above, the STV Scheme currently extends beyond the public sector and encompasses professional bodies and industry associations. Commercial organisations may also collaborate with authorised organisations under the Scheme to organise eligible specified short-term activities, thereby benefiting from the relevant immigration facilitation. In considering whether to further relax the scheme, the Government shall take into account two major principles, including that eligible individuals visiting Hong Kong for specified short-term activities under the Scheme will not displace the local workforce, and there will not be a risk of abuse (including illegal employment). The Government will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the STV Scheme as well as the views of the relevant departments and the sectors concerned, and timely review the Scheme's coverage to strike an appropriate balance between immigration control and facilitation. We welcome interested commercial organisations to contact relevant B/Ds or authorised organisations in their respective sectors and consider co-organising eligible events, with a view to promoting more diverse forms of exchange and collaboration under the Scheme.

(4) The implementation of the entry arrangement for training facilitates individuals with genuine needs to enter Hong Kong for training, enabling them to acquire local knowledge, experience or skills. It also helps promote and consolidate Hong Kong's role in assisting Mainland enterprises in ""going global"".

Currently, Mainland business associates and/or employees of Mainland branches of well-established companies in Hong Kong may apply to enter Hong Kong for training. In 2025 (as at July), the monthly average number of cases involving Mainland residents approved for entry to Hong Kong for training was 197, representing a slight increase from 2024 which recorded a monthly average of 194 cases.

The Government will continue to timely review the entry arrangement for training in Hong Kong to ensure that the arrangement remains consistent with the objectives and the development needs of Hong Kong."
立法會八題：推動「一帶一路」建設,2025-09-10 12:04,2025-09-10 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000165.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上馬逢國議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的書面答覆：

問題：

香港一直積極參與「一帶一路」的發展機遇。特區政府不時組織官方和商界考察團前往有關國家／地區進行考察，並連續第10年在香港舉行「一帶一路高峰論壇」。就推動「一帶一路」建設，政府可否告知本會：

（一）特區政府在來年有否組織考察團的計劃；如有，詳情為何，以及有否前往「一帶一路」沿線70多個國家／地區考察的計劃；

（二）鑑於特區政府正積極推進在沙特阿拉伯利雅得和馬來西亞吉隆坡設立經濟貿易辦事處（經貿辦），有關工作的進度為何；當局有否為擬申請到該兩個經貿辦工作的人員提供有關伊斯蘭文化的培訓，或聘請信仰為伊斯蘭教的人員派駐該兩個經貿辦；

（三）為加深港人及企業對「一帶一路」國家／地區的認識，除舉辦「一帶一路高峰論壇」外，政府有否計劃舉行有關「一帶一路」沿線國家／地區的政治、經濟、社會和人文風俗的介紹課程；

（四）鑑於有意見認為，「一帶一路」沿線國家／地區擁有自身的獨特文化與藝術基因，過去三年，每年特區政府有否與該等國家／地區進行文化藝術的交流，以確立香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心的角色；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（五）過去一年，「一帶一路」辦公室在推動香港與「一帶一路」沿線國家／地區合作交流及經貿往來的工作成績為何？

答覆：

主席：

香港是共建「一帶一路」的積極參與者、貢獻者及受益者，一直全面參與和助力共建「一帶一路」，擔當好香港作為「一帶一路」功能平台的角色，致力發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」作用，深化國際交往合作，協助香港企業與專業界別拓展「一帶一路」機遇。

就馬逢國議員的提問，經諮詢各相關政策局後，我現回覆如下：

（一）政府會繼續積極外訪「一帶一路」國家等重點市場，率領工商界及專業服務界到當地市場考察，推廣香港「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，用好香港「引進來、走出去」的橋樑作用，為香港企業（包括中小企和專業服務）開拓更多商機。

（二）現時，特區政府在海外設立14個香港駐海外經濟貿易辦事處（經貿辦）。我們會繼續擴闊經貿辦網絡，吸引更多「全球南方」的企業和投資。其中，我們正與馬來西亞和沙特阿拉伯政府積極跟進開設經貿辦的計劃。我們會按既定機制安排合適的人員出任經貿辦的職位。一般來說，經貿辦的人手包括香港派駐人員，以及熟悉當地文化、語言等的當地僱員。

（三）「一帶一路」辦公室於今年二月十四日舉辦「一帶一路跨專業論壇」，吸引逾250名來自本港、內地和「一帶一路」國家的商界人士出席進行高層次交流，並展示多項「一帶一路」商業案例和潛在項目，推廣香港專業服務。「一帶一路」辦公室亦自二○二三年十一月起舉辦了10次交流會，以及通過短片、傳媒訪問及社交媒體，邀請「一帶一路」國家的駐香港總領事、專業團體和企業代表及青年代表分享「一帶一路」的機遇及相關經驗。另外，我們已在「一帶一路」辦公室網頁統整政府及相關機構的「一帶一路」主題活動，鼓勵相關企業和專業界別及市民參與。

公務員學院（學院）舉辦的本地及內地課程都會涵蓋「一帶一路」發展的相關內容，以加深公務員對這項重要國家戰略的理解。例如「聯通世界：東盟系列」講座和「撮合南北：多極世界中的中國系列」講座，邀請來自各地包括「一帶一路」國家的領袖和專家，講解相關國家／地區的發展，以及與香港的合作和聯繫。學院亦繼續與外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署合辦「國家外交事務系列」講座，其中內容包括「一帶一路」倡議等重要議題。

（四）特區政府一直致力推動文化藝術發展，提升香港文化軟實力及影響力，並配合國家的整體文化發展策略，鞏固香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心的地位。文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）、康樂及文化事務署（康文署）、文創產業發展處（文創處）及西九文化區管理局（西九管理局）一直積極與「一帶一路」國家進行文化藝術交流。

文體旅局每年撥款資助香港藝團／藝術家在海外舉辦文化藝術活動，包括「一帶一路」相關國家。康文署則在內地與海外城市舉辦「香港周」，促進香港與「一帶一路」地區的文化交流。繼二○二三年於泰國曼谷舉辦「香港周」後，今年「香港周」將於九月至十月於韓國首爾舉行。

另一方面，康文署策劃「亞藝無疆」藝術節等活動，邀請海外藝團／藝術家來港演出。康文署和西九管理局亦與內地和海外的博物館合作，在香港舉辦大型展覽和相關的學術及專業交流活動，並商議提供珍貴文物赴港展出。

此外，文體旅局和康文署在香港舉辦大型國際會議論壇或平台，包括亞洲文化合作論壇+、博物館高峰論壇、香港演藝博覽等，匯聚來自內地和「一帶一路」等國家的文化部長、高層官員、文化領袖和專業人士，就推廣文化藝術發展交流良方善策，及促進境內外同業的交流及業務商談合作，充分展現香港「超級聯繫人」及中外文化藝術交流中心的角色。

西九管理局也一直積極與「一帶一路」國家合作並把世界級展覽「走出去」，例如，香港故宮文化博物館與多哈伊斯蘭藝術博物館合作舉辦特別展覽；M+策展的「貝聿銘：人生如建築」特別展覽將在多哈卡塔爾博物館阿爾里瓦克展覽館展出。

創意產業方面，文創處透過「創意智優計劃」及電影發展基金，資助香港文創業界參加「一帶一路」國家／地區的交流及業務配對活動，例如在泰國曼谷、印尼雅加達及馬來西亞吉隆坡舉行的大型潮玩展覽，及支持本地電視台與「一帶一路」國家／地區的電視台聯合製作綜藝電視節目；亦會邀請「一帶一路」國家／地區同業參與本地文創產業相關活動，推動跨地域文創產業交流及合作，並支持本地業界與「一帶一路」國家／地區業界合作。

（五）過去一年，政府繼續通過多元措施深化與「一帶一路」國家的合作，包括：

（a）拓展經貿網絡

政府繼續拓展經貿網絡，協助港商及投資者開拓「一帶一路」市場，以促進香港的長遠經濟發展。我們正與馬來西亞和沙特阿拉伯政府積極跟進開設經貿辦的計劃。投資推廣署於二○二四年七月在埃及開羅開設顧問辦事處，而該署在土耳其第三大城市伊茲密爾的顧問辦事處亦已於今年一月投入運作，致力開拓區內新興市場；

（b）商簽雙邊協議

香港與33個海外經濟體（包括「一帶一路」沿線經濟體）簽訂了24份促進和保護投資協定（投資協定），包括巴林、科威特、土耳其及阿拉伯聯合酋長國。香港與卡塔爾已大致完成投資協定談判，並正與沙特阿拉伯、孟加拉國、埃及和秘魯探討簽訂投資協定。此外，香港與53個稅務管轄區（包括37個「一帶一路」沿線稅務管轄區）簽訂全面性避免雙重課稅協定；

「一帶一路」辦公室亦於今年八月二十九日與沙特阿拉伯投資部簽署合作諒解備忘錄，加強在基礎建設及建築相關領域的資訊交流，並由沙特阿拉伯投資部為香港相關專業服務進入當地市場提供支持；

（c）組織外訪考察

二○二四年五月十六日至二十五日，「一帶一路」辦公室聯同國家商務部「聯合走出去」，率領內地與香港經貿代表團共約70人訪問匈牙利及哈薩克斯坦，回港取道新疆，推動香港與內地企業和香港專業服務共同開拓「一帶一路」市場。港方代表團共簽署10份合作備忘錄，涵蓋市場拓展、金融支付科技、初創企業生態圈、投資合作和物流等；

二○二四年七月二十八日至八月二日，行政長官率領45人組成的代表團訪問老撾、柬埔寨及越南，共簽署了55份合作備忘錄和協議，涵蓋貿易和經濟合作、投資、海關合作、教育、物流合作、旅遊推廣、科技合作、航空服務，以及金融、銀行和資本市場發展等範疇；

二○二四年十月二十八日至三十一日，財政司司長率領超過100人組成的金融及創科界的商務代表團訪問沙特阿拉伯，加強和深化香港與中東地區在經貿、金融和創科等方面聯繫，並出席第八屆「未來投資倡議大會」，以及促成了一系列合作項目；

二○二四年十二月四日至六日，商務及經濟發展局局長率領商務代表團前往新疆烏魯木齊。其間，代表團成員出席中國（新疆、香港）—哈薩克斯坦合作對接會，推介香港優勢，促進與新疆和哈薩克斯坦的經貿及人文合作，共同開拓「一帶一路」的全方位機遇；

今年五月十日至十五日，行政長官率領50多位香港商貿代表和內地企業代表組成的商貿代表團前往卡塔爾和科威特訪問，目的是要與中東地區進一步建立政府之間的關係、開拓合作領域，以及交朋友，擴大「朋友圈」。是次出訪成果豐碩，包括達成了共59項合作備忘錄和協議合作，涵蓋經貿、投資、金融服務、科技、法律、物流、航空服務、專上教育等範疇，以及進一步建立與海灣阿拉伯國家合作委員會國家的關係；

今年六月二十二日至二十六日，「一帶一路」專員率領代表團訪問印尼和馬來西亞，推廣香港基礎建設和建築相關的專業服務，開拓合作機遇。代表團在兩地出席重點工程項目簡介會，與當地企業代表直接交流，洽談投資和合作的具體商機。代表團亦與印尼和馬來西亞的夥伴簽訂21份合作備忘錄，涵蓋商貿合作和專業服務交流等多個範疇；以及

（d）舉辦重點活動

商務及經濟發展局會繼續積極通過舉辦各項重點活動推介香港優勢並促進香港與「一帶一路」國家的企業對接及項目參與。香港自二○一六年起每年舉辦「一帶一路高峰論壇」，是國家認可為共建「一帶一路」構建人類命運共同體的重大實踐案例。今年九月十日至十一日舉辦的第十屆論壇，主題為「合作求變‧共建未來」，預計吸引約6 000名來自「一帶一路」國家和地區的政商領袖出席，並促成多份合作備忘錄，同時多個機構亦在論壇前後舉辦活動以加強協同效應。「一帶一路」辦公室於二○二四年四月為沙特阿拉伯的NEOM新未來城協辦「發現NEOM」香港路演活動，吸引來自內地及香港的相關企業、投資者和專業服務代表共約1 100人次參加，而「一帶一路」辦公室在活動期間舉辦了兩場商貿接會，促進40間香港及內地的企業與NEOM共同探討合作。部分其他活動已載於上文第（三）部分的回覆。"
LCQ8: Promoting implementation of Belt and Road Initiative,2025-09-10 12:04,2025-09-10 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000166.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Ma Fung-kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

 Hong Kong has been actively participating in the development opportunities presented by the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI). The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government regularly organises official and business delegations to conduct visits to relevant countries/regions, and has hosted the Belt and Road Summit in Hong Kong for 10 consecutive years. Regarding the promotion of the implementation of the B&RI, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the Hong Kong SAR Government has plans to organise delegations in the coming year; if so, of the details, and whether there are plans to conduct visits to over 70 countries/regions along the Belt and Road;

(2) given that the Hong Kong SAR Government is actively pursuing the establishment of Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, of the progress of the relevant work; whether the authorities have provided training on Islamic culture for personnel intending to apply for posts at these two ETOs, or recruited Muslim personnel to be posted to these two ETOs;

(3) to enhance the understanding of Hong Kong people and enterprises about the Belt and Road countries/regions, apart from hosting the Belt and Road Summit, whether the Government has plans to organise introductory courses on the politics, economy, society and cultural customs of the countries/regions along the Belt and Road;

(4) as there are views that the Belt and Road countries/regions possess their own unique cultural and artistic heritage, whether the Hong Kong SAR Government engaged in cultural and artistic exchanges with these countries/regions in each of the past three years, so as to establish Hong Kong's role as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) of the achievements made by the Belt and Road Office over the past year in promoting the co-operation and exchanges, as well as the economic ties between Hong Kong and countries/regions along the Belt and Road?

Reply:

President,

 Hong Kong is an active participant, contributor and beneficiary of the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI). We have been fully participating in and contributing to the B&RI, utilising the role as a functional platform for the Belt and Road (B&R) and serving our role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", thereby deepening international exchanges and co-operation as well as assisting Hong Kong companies and professional sectors to explore the B&R opportunities.

 In consultation with relevant bureaux, the consolidated reply to the Hon Ma Fung-kwok's question is as follows:

(1) The Government will continue to pay visits and lead business and professional services delegations to priority markets such as the B&R countries, promoting Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" and acting as a bridge to serve enterprises in going global and attracting external investment, to open up more business opportunities for Hong Kong companies (including small and medium enterprises and professional services).

(2) Currently, the Government has 14 overseas Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs). We will continue to expand our ETO network and attract more inward investment and enterprises from the Global South markets to Hong Kong. In this regard, the Government is following up actively with the governments of Malaysia and Saudi Arabia on the establishment of ETOs in these two countries. We will arrange suitable officers to take up positions in the ETOs in accordance with the established mechanism. Generally speaking, the ETOs' manpower comprises Hong Kong-based officers and local staff who are familiar with local culture, language, etc.

(3) The Belt and Road Office (BRO) held the Belt and Road Cross-professional Forum on February 14, 2025, which attracted over 250 business participants from Hong Kong, the Mainland and B&R countries to engage in high-level exchanges and showcased a number of B&R business cases and potential projects, to promote Hong Kong's professional services. Since November 2023, the BRO has organised 10 exchange sessions and has made use of short videos, media interviews and social media, inviting Consuls-General from the B&R countries in Hong Kong as well as representatives of professional bodies, enterprises and youths to share the opportunities and relevant experience in the B&R countries. In addition, we have consolidated the B&R-themed activities of the Government and relevant organisations onto the BRO's website to encourage participation by relevant companies, professional sectors and members of the public.

 Both local and Mainland programmes organised by the Civil Service College (CSC) cover topics related to the development of the B&RI to enable civil servants to gain a deeper understanding of this important national strategy. For example, the Executive Series on ""Connecting with the World - ASEAN"" and the Executive Series on ""Brokering North and South: China in a Multipolar World"" invite leaders and experts from around the world, including those from the B&R countries, to share insights on the development of relevant countries/regions and their collaborations and connections with Hong Kong. The CSC also continues to collaborate with the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to run a series of talks on the country's foreign affairs, which also cover important topics including the B&RI.

(4) The Government has been committed to promoting the development of arts and culture, enhancing Hong Kong's cultural soft power and influence, and consolidating Hong Kong's position as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange, in line with our nation's overall policy on cultural development. The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency (CCIDA) and the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority (WKCDA) have been actively engaging in arts and cultural exchanges with countries along the B&R.

 Every year, the CSTB provides funding for Hong Kong arts groups/artists to organise arts and cultural events on the Mainland and overseas, including relevant B&R countries. The LCSD organises the Hong Kong Week on the Mainland and overseas cities to promote cultural exchange between Hong Kong and the B&R region. Following its staging in Bangkok in 2023, the Hong Kong Week will be held in Seoul, Korea from September to October this year.

 On another front, the LCSD organises such activities as the Asia+ Festival, inviting overseas arts groups/artists to perform in Hong Kong. The LCSD and the WKCDA also collaborate with museums on the Mainland and overseas to organise large-scale exhibitions, academic and professional related exchange activities in Hong Kong, and to explore opportunities for bringing in precious cultural relics to Hong Kong for display.

 In addition, the CSTB and the LCSD organise large-scale international summits, forums or platforms, including the Asia Cultural Co-operation Forum, the Museum Summit and the Hong Kong Performing Arts Expo, etc, which gather cultural ministers, senior officials, cultural leaders and professionals from the Mainland and B&R countries to exchange views on strategies in promoting arts and cultural development, as well as facilitate exchanges and business negotiations of industry players of different places, fully demonstrating Hong Kong's role of a ""super connector"" and East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange.

 The WKCDA has also been actively collaborating with countries along the B&R and bringing world-class exhibitions overseas. For instance, the Hong Kong Palace Museum collaborated with the Museum of Islamic Art, a part of Qatar Museums, to present a special exhibition, while the special exhibition ""I. M. Pei: Life is Architecture"" curated by M+ will be staged at Qatar Museums Gallery, Al Riwaq in Doha.

 On creative industries, the CCIDA, through the CreateSmart Initiative and the Film Development Fund, funds various creative sectors in Hong Kong to participate in exchange and business-matching activities in the B&R countries/regions, such as large-scale art toy exhibitions in Bangkok (Thailand), Jakarta (Indonesia) and Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), and supports local television stations to co-produce variety television programmes with stations from the B&R countries/regions. The CCIDA also invites counterparts from the B&R countries/regions to participate in relevant activities in Hong Kong, so as to promote cross-regional exchange and collaboration in the cultural and creative industries, and supports the collaboration of local sectors and those from the B&R countries/regions.

(5) In the past year, the Government continued to deepen the co-operation with the B&R countries through a range of measures, including:

(a) Expanding economic and trade networks

 The Government continues to expand our economic and trade networks, with a view to assisting Hong Kong enterprises and investors in expanding into the B&R markets and promoting the long-term economic development of Hong Kong. The Government is actively following up on the establishment of an ETO in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia. Invest Hong Kong set up a consultant office in Cairo, Egypt in July 2024, and its consultant office in Izmir, Türkiye's third largest city, commenced operation in January this year to explore emerging markets in the region;

(b) Negotiating and signing bilateral agreements

 Hong Kong has signed 24 Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (IPPAs) with 33 overseas economies (including B&R economies), including Bahrain, Kuwait, Türkiye and the United Arab Emirates. Hong Kong has substantially concluded negotiations on an IPPA with Qatar and is exploring the signing of IPPAs with Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Egypt and Peru. In addition, Hong Kong has signed Comprehensive Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements with 53 jurisdictions (including 37 B&R jurisdictions);

 The BRO has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia (MISA) on August 29, 2025, to enhance information exchange in relation to the fields of infrastructure and construction, and for MISA to provide support to related professional services in Hong Kong to access the Saudi Arabian market;

(c) Organising outbound visits

 From May 16 to 25, 2024, the BRO and the Ministry of Commerce co-led an around 70-strong Hong Kong cum Mainland business delegation to visit Hungary and Kazakhstan, and returned via Xinjiang, encouraging Hong Kong and Mainland enterprises as well as Hong Kong's professional services in jointly exploring the B&R markets. The Hong Kong delegation signed 10 MOUs, covering areas including market collaboration, financial payment technology, start-up ecosystem, investment co-operation and logistics;

  From July 28 to August 2, 2024, the Chief Executive (CE) led a 45-strong delegation to visit Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, with a total of 55 MOUs and agreements signed in areas including trade and economic partnerships, investment, customs collaboration, education, logistics co-operation, tourism promotions, technological co-operation, aviation services, as well as financial, banking and capital market development;

 From October 28 to 31, 2024, the Financial Secretary led a business delegation of over 100 members, including representatives from the finance as well as innovation and technology (I&T) sectors, on a visit to Saudi Arabia to strengthen and deepen connections between Hong Kong and the Middle East in trade, finance and I&T, as well as participate in the 8th Future Investment Initiative Conference, and facilitated a number of joint projects;

 From December 4 to 6, 2024, the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development led a business delegation to Urumqi, Xinjiang, during which delegation members attended a co-operation and exchange forum between China (Xinjiang, Hong Kong) and Kazakhstan to promote Hong Kong's advantages, as well as promote economic and trade co-operation and people-to-people exchanges with Xinjiang and Kazakhstan, with a view to jointly exploring the full range of opportunities arising from the B&RI;

 From May 10 to 15, 2025, the CE led a delegation of more than 50 representatives from the business community of Hong Kong and Mainland enterprises to visit Qatar and Kuwait. The major goals for the mission were to strengthen government-to-government relations, to explore new areas of co-operation, and to make friends and expand our network. The mission yielded fruitful results, including reaching a total of 59 MOUs and agreements covering trade, investment, financial services, technology, legal, logistics, aviation services, post-secondary education, etc, and further building relations with the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf countries;

 From June 22 to 26, 2025, the Commissioner for Belt and Road led a delegation to Indonesia and Malaysia to promote Hong Kong's professional services related to infrastructure and construction and to explore opportunities for co-operation. The delegation attended presentations of signature projects in the two places, directly connecting with representatives of local enterprises to explore commercially viable investment and co-operation. The delegation also signed 21 MOUs with their partners in Indonesia and Malaysia, covering such areas as business collaboration and exchanges in professional services; and

(d) Organising major events

 The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau will continue to actively organise various major events to promote Hong Kong's advantages and facilitate business matching and project participation between Hong Kong and the B&R countries. Hong Kong has been organising the Belt and Road Summit annually since 2016, and the Summit has been recognised by our country as a case of significance for the implementation of the B&RI in building a global community of shared future. The 10th Summit is being held on September 10 and 11, 2025, under the theme ""Collaborate for Change • Shape a Shared Future"", and is expected to attract around 6 000 government officials and business leaders from the B&R countries and regions, as well as facilitate a number of MOUs. A number of organisations will also organise events around the Summit period for greater synergies. In April 2024, the BRO partnered with NEOM of Saudi Arabia to organise the ""Discover NEOM Hong Kong"" roadshow, which attracted around 1 100 participants, including enterprises, investors and professional representatives from the Mainland and Hong Kong. During the roadshow, the BRO organised two business matching sessions, facilitating potential collaborations between 40 Hong Kong and Mainland enterprises and NEOM. Some other major events have been covered in the reply to part (3) above."

LCQ14: Building a data trading ecosystem,2025-09-10 11:51,2025-09-10 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000277.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Martin Liao and a written reply by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  The Financial Secretary has indicated in the 2024-2025 Budget that the Government has commissioned an expert group to undertake an in depth study on how to develop a robust data trading ecosystem in Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the facilitation measure on the Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information Within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong) (the GBA Standard Contract) has been extended to all sectors since November 1 last year to facilitate the safe cross-boundary flow of personal information within the GBA, of the current number of enterprises participating in the GBA Standard Contract and the details of their respective industries;

(2) whether the Government will explore the setting up of a data exchange in Hong Kong and the development of a comprehensive data market trading system, including standardised data format, data pricing mechanisms, categorised and hierarchical rules for data protection, data security protection mechanisms, definition of data ownership, etc., with a view to enhancing the marketisation of data elements; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views that, following the active development of the data trading market in the Mainland, more legal disputes relating to cross-boundary data trading (such as those concerning data storage, processing, ownership, and trading) may arise constantly, how will the Government capitalise on Hong Kong's strengths as a ""super connector"" and an international arbitration centre to establish a cross-boundary data trading dispute resolution mechanism, thereby laying a solid foundation for developing a robust data trading ecosystem?

Reply:

President,

  Having consulted the Department of Justice (DoJ), our reply to the questions raised by the Hon Martin Liao is as follows:

(1) The Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau and the Cyberspace Administration of China signed the ""Memorandum of Understanding on Facilitating Cross-boundary Data Flow within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area"" in June 2023, and jointly announced the facilitation measure on the ""Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)"" (the GBA Standard Contract) in December 2023 to facilitate cross boundary flow of personal information from the Mainland cities in the GBA to Hong Kong and streamline the relevant arrangements.

The ""early and pilot implementation"" arrangement of the facilitation measure on the GBA Standard Contract for the banking, credit referencing and healthcare sectors has operated smoothly and received positive industry feedback. From November 2024, the facilitation measure on the GBA Standard Contract was regularised and extended to all sectors. As of end-August 2025, the Digital Policy Office has processed around 100 filing applications from different sectors, including healthcare, credit referencing, insurance, securities and printing sectors, etc. The proportion of filing applications by sectors is as follows:




Sector
Proportion


Healthcare
24%


Credit Referencing
16%


Insurance
14%


Securities
9%


Printing
9%


Information Technology
8%


Banking
7%


Others
12%




(2) With the acceleration of global digital transformation, data has become a key production factor, and a highly efficient data ecosystem is one of the key factors attracting enterprises to establish a foothold in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is underpinned by its distinctive advantages under ""one country, two systems"" and endowed with the characteristics of an international city. From supply and demand of data to application scenarios, Hong Kong is equipped with a robust foundation and possess an abundance of favourable conditions for promoting the development of data ecosystem.

The Financial Secretary announced in the 2024-25 Budget that an expert group, comprising professionals from sectors such as information technology, commerce and industry, finance and data sources, is commissioned to study how to develop a robust data trading ecosystem in Hong Kong. This includes Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" in data trading, the prerequisites, rules, and measures for promoting international data trading, as well as feasible implementation models. The study also covers key issues related to data trading, including data format standardisation, data pricing mechanisms, and data security protection, etc. The expert group is conducting a consultancy study on these topics and is expected to complete work and submit recommendations to the Government within 2025-26.

(3) Resolving legal issues and disputes that may arise from cross-boundary data flow (including through the voluntary adoption of the GBA Standard Contract) depends on the arrangements agreed upon by the parties to the contract and other applicable laws and regulations. Taking the GBA Standard Contract as an example, the contract template stipulates that any disputes arising between the parties to the contract shall be resolved through negotiation. If negotiation fails, the parties may choose to resolve the dispute through litigation or arbitration. If arbitration is opted, the dispute may be submitted to arbitral institutions including, inter alia, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre, and the arbitral proceedings may be conducted in Hong Kong in accordance with the arbitration rules in force at the time. This provides a dispute resolution mechanism for cross-boundary data flow within the GBA.

In strengthening Hong Kong's advantages as an international arbitration centre, Hong Kong has been committed to promoting online dispute resolution (ODR) and deal-making services. According to information provided by the DoJ, the 2018 Policy Address proposed supporting the development of an online platform to provide efficient and cost-effective ODR services in Hong Kong. As a result, eBRAM International Online Dispute Resolution Centre (eBRAM Centre) was established. Since 2022, eBRAM Centre has launched online platforms, including the ""eBRAM APEC Online Dispute Resolution Platform"", ""Online Mediation Platform"" and ""Online Arbitration Platform"", providing efficient, cost-effective, and secure ODR services for parties from anywhere in the world. To facilitate cross-boundary commercial transactions and expand cross-boundary businesses, eBRAM Centre launched the ""Deal-Making Portal"" in December 2023. As of August 2025, more than 550 enterprises of various categories (including legal, professional and commercial services, information technology, etc. from Hong Kong, Mainland and other regions) have joined the ""Deal-Making Portal"".

Regarding the GBA, the DoJ first published the Action Plan on the Construction of Rule of Law in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in April 2024, actively supporting the establishment and promotion of a common ODR platform within the GBA. eBRAM Centre launched the thematic website of the GBA Online Collaborative Platform in July 2024, providing one-stop information on dispute resolution services within the GBA to integrate the arbitration and mediation resources of the GBA. A total of 14 memoranda of understanding with institutions have been signed so far for the Collaborative Platform.

The Government believes that Hong Kong, leveraging its strengths as an international legal and dispute resolution hub, particularly its professional expertise and institutional foundation in arbitration and mediation, can continue to enhance its dispute resolution mechanisms. This will help build a more robust ecosystem for resolving cross-boundary commercial disputes, including those arising from cross-boundary data flow. The Government will continue to monitor relevant developments, conduct study as and when appropriate, maintain communication with stakeholders in the legal and dispute resolution sectors. The Government will also strengthen exchanges and cooperation with the Mainland legal community to promote regional experience sharing as and when appropriate."
​立法會十四題：構建數據交易生態,2025-09-10 11:51,2025-09-10 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000266.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上廖長江議員的提問和創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授的書面答覆：

問題：

財政司司長在2024-2025財政年度的《財政預算案》中表示，政府已委託專家組，就如何為香港構建良好的數據交易生態進行深入研究。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於《粵港澳大灣區（內地、香港）個人信息跨境流動標準合同》（《大灣區標準合同》）便利措施已於去年十一月一日擴展至各行業，以促進粵港澳大灣區個人信息跨境安全流動，目前參與《大灣區標準合同》的企業數目及其所屬行業詳情為何；

（二）政府會否研究成立香港數據交易所，並建立一套完整的數據市場交易制度，包括數據格式標準化、數據定價機制、分類分級保護規則、安全保護機制、數據權屬界定等，以促進數據要素市場化；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為，隨着內地積極開拓數據交易市場，跨境數據交易相關的法律糾紛（例如數據存儲、處理、權屬和交易等環節）可能會持續增加，政府如何發揮香港作為「超級聯繫人」及國際仲裁中心的優勢，建立跨境數據交易爭議解決機制，為構建良好的數據交易生態奠定良好基礎？

答覆：

主席：

就廖議員的提問，經諮詢律政司後，我現回覆如下：

（一）創新科技及工業局與國家互聯網信息辦公室於二○二三年六月簽訂《促進粵港澳大灣區數據跨境流動的合作備忘錄》，並於二○二三年十二月共同發布《粵港澳大灣區（內地、香港）個人信息跨境流動標準合同》（《大灣區標準合同》）便利措施，以促進大灣區內地城市的個人信息跨境流動到香港及簡化有關安排。

《大灣區標準合同》便利措施首先於銀行、信貸資料及醫療業界先行先試，運作暢順並獲得業界正面評價。自二○二四年十一月，《大灣區標準合同》便利措施已推展至各行各業，恆常化推行。截至二○二五年八月底，數字政策辦公室已處理約100份備案申請，涉及醫療、徵信、保險、證券及印刷等不同行業。各行業備案數目比例如下：




行業
佔比


醫療業

徵信業
16%


保險業
14%


證券業
9%


印刷業
9%


科技業
8%


銀行業
7%


其他

（二）隨着全球數字化轉型加速，數據已成為關鍵的生產要素，而高效的數據生態圈正是吸引企業落戶香港的重要因素之一。香港憑藉在一國兩制下的獨特優勢，以及國際化的特點，從數據的供需到應用場景，都具備優厚的基礎和條件促進數據生態圈的發展。

財政司司長於二○二四至二五年度《財政預算案》中宣布委託專家組，包括資訊科技、工商、金融、數據源等界別的專家，研究如何為香港構建良好的數據交易生態，包括香港在數據交易中作為超級連接人的角色、推動國際數據貿易的先決條件、規則及措施，以及可行的推行模式等。研究亦涵蓋與數據交易有關的重要議題，包括數據格式標準化、數據定價機制、數據安全保護等。專家組正就上述議題進行顧問研究，預計於二○二五至二六年度內完成並向政府提交建議。

（三）解決跨境數據流動（包括透過自願採用《大灣區標準合同》模式）可能引起的法律問題及爭議，需視乎合約雙方所協議的安排及其他適用的法規。以《大灣區標準合同》為例，合同範本條文已訂明合同雙方如有爭議，應當協商解決；協商解決不成的，則可選擇以訴訟或仲裁解決。若選擇仲裁，爭議可提交香港國際仲裁中心等仲裁機構，按適用的仲裁規則在香港進行仲裁，為粵港澳大灣區跨境數據流動提供可行的爭端解決途徑。

在加強香港作為國際仲裁中心的優勢方面，香港一直致力推動網上爭議解決及交易促成服務。根據律政司提供的資料，二○一八年《施政報告》提出支持發展網上平台，以便在香港提供高效率及具成本效益的網上爭議解決服務，一邦國際網上仲調中心（eBRAM中心）因而成立。eBRAM中心自二○二二年起推出網上平台，包括「亞太經濟合作組織網上爭議解決平台」、「網上調解平台」及「網上仲裁平台」，為身處世界任何地方的各方提供高效、具成本效益和安全的網上爭議解決服務。為便利企業進行跨境商業交易以及拓展跨境業務，eBRAM中心於二○二三年十二月推出「網上交易促成平台」。截至二○二五年八月，超過550家不同類別的企業（包括來自香港、內地及其他地區的法律、專業及商業服務、資訊科技等行業）已加入交易促成平台。

就粵港澳大灣區而言，律政司在二○二四年四月首次發布《粵港澳大灣區法治建設行動綱領》，積極支持建立及推廣大灣區內通用的線上爭議解決平台。eBRAM中心於二○二四年七月推出大灣區在線爭議解決機構協作平台的主題網站，提供一站式有關大灣區內爭議解決服務的資訊，以整合大灣區仲調資源。協作平台至今載有與14個機構簽署的合作備忘錄。

政府相信香港可憑藉其作為國際法律服務及爭議解決中心的優勢，尤其在仲裁及調解服務方面的專業能力與制度基礎，繼續優化爭議解決機制，為解決跨境商業糾紛，包括跨境數據流動所引致的糾紛，構建更完善的生態。政府將繼續密切留意相關發展趨勢，適時作出研究，並與法律及爭議解決業界持份者保持溝通。政府亦會適時加強與內地法律界的交流協作，推動區域層面的經驗分享。"
Speech by Secretary for Health at Opening Ceremony of BIOHK2025 (English only),2025-09-10 11:50,2025-09-10 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000295.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, at the Opening Ceremony of BIOHK2025 today (September 10):

Mr C Y Leung (Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), Professor Sun Dong (Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry), Professor Albert Yu (Chairman of the Hong Kong Biotechnology Organization (HKBIO) and President of BIOHK2025), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  It is a pleasure to join you all again at BIOHK2025. On behalf of the Health Bureau of the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government, I would like to welcome all delegates to the BIOHK2025 and thank the Hong Kong Biotechnology Organization for creating this exceptional platform that brings together the brightest minds in biotechnology from East and West.

  Last year at this very convention, I shared with you our resolute mission: to transform Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub. Today, I am delighted to give you a quick update on the significant strides we have made, turning that vision into tangible action and reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" in the global biotech landscape.

  Our commitment is unwavering. Hong Kong's unique position in biotech is reinforced by national policies, including the 14th Five-Year Plan, which designates Hong Kong as an international innovation and technology hub. We are pressing ahead with the reform of the regulatory framework for drugs and medical devices to facilitate the translation and application of biomedical innovations.

  To this end, we have achieved several key milestones:

  First, we implemented the ""1+"" mechanism in November 2023, which has been extended to all new drugs last year. Since implementation, 14 new drugs have been approved. Five of them have been listed in the Hospital Authority Drug Formulary.

  Second, to enhance the efficiency in processing relevant applications, a consultation service for new drug applications under the ""1+"" mechanism was launched in March this year.

  Third, in June this year, we announced the roadmap and timetable for implementing ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration by phases beginning next year and establishing the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation by the end of next year.

  Fourth, the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute (GBAICTI), which we launched in Hetao last November, is now fully operational. The simultaneous launch of the GBAICTI and the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trials Center in Shenzhen marked the beginning of a new chapter in cross-boundary collaboration under the ""one zone, two parks"" model. The GBAICTI is already actively advancing clinical trial projects and, to complement this, the Government is seeking to establish the Real-World Study and Application Centre by the end of this year to accelerate the research and development, approval and market launch of innovative medical products.

  Ladies and gentlemen, these initiatives are creating a vibrant and supportive ecosystem for the entire biotechnology industry. Last year, I encouraged you to participate actively in Hong Kong's health and medical innovation landscape. Today, that invitation is stronger than ever. Whether you are seeking to conduct cutting-edge clinical trials, navigate new regulatory pathways, or enter the vast Greater Bay Area market, Hong Kong is your perfect choice.

  On that note, I wish you all a fruitful and inspiring convention. Thank you."

問題：

有意見認為屯門公路、吐露港公路及新田公路等快速公路是本港的交通黑點；在該等公路上不時有輕型貨車使用最右行車線，影響交通流量和阻擋後車駕駛者視線，造成交通安全隱患，因此政府可檢討快速公路最右線使用權的安排以減少交通意外。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年各類型車輛在快速公路上發生的交通意外數目及有關的傷亡情況為何；

（二）鑑於有意見認為不少交通意外是由於車輛超越前車引起，過去五年，每年警方針對在快速公路上長期佔用最右線，以及違例使用該行車線的車輛所作出的檢控數目分別為何；

（三）鑑於現時法例規定，快速公路的行車道如有三條或以上開放的行車線，中型貨車、重型貨車及巴士除駛往右面出口外，不可使用快速公路最右線，但有關限制並不適用於輕型貨車，政府在執法時有何方法分辨行車線上的車輛類別，例如是單靠目測分辨，抑或利用其他輔助方法；及

（四）為避免快速公路上的貨車因阻擋後車駕駛者視線而造成交通意外，政府有否計劃進一步禁止貨車使用快速公路的最右線，例如會否考慮限制超過一定高度的貨車使用該線；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

現時《道路交通（快速公路）規例》（第374Q章）對駕駛者在快速公路上使用最右線及超越前方車輛已設有限制。一般而言，駕駛者在快速公路上必須在最左線行車。駕駛者如須越過其前面車輛，必須使用其右方行車線，並盡快駛回左線。另外，中、重型貨車、巴士等大型車輛在設有三條或以上行車線的快速公路上行駛時，不得在該快速公路的最右線駕駛，除非該最右線連結一條轉向行車線。就陳月明議員關於快速公路交通意外及最右線使用安排的提問，經諮詢香港警務處（警務處）及運輸署，我現回覆如下：

（一）二○二○年至二○二四年各類型車輛在快速公路上的涉及意外車輛數字及傷亡情況載於附件。總體而言，二○二○年至二○二二年的數字或受新冠疫情因素影響而較低，而二○二三年至二○二四年交通意外宗數有所上升，主要是由於輕微交通意外宗數增加。

（二）二○二○年至二○二四年涉及在快速公路上長期佔用最右線和違例使用最右線的檢控數字表列如下。二○二二年至二○二四年間檢控宗數有所上升，主要是由於「影住駕」交通舉報電子平台自二○二二年推出後警務處接獲的舉報個案有所增加。

註：第374Q章第11條列明適用的汽車種類，其中包括中型及重型貨車、私家及公共巴士、拖曳着拖車或另一車輛的汽車、獲發快速公路許可證的汽車、救援車輛及藉暫准駕駛執照獲授權駕駛的電單車、機動三輪車、私家車或輕型貨車的人所駕駛的車輛等。

警務處會持續檢視交通意外趨勢及執法成效，適時調整執法力度，以確保道路安全，亦會繼續鼓勵市民使用不同平台舉報相關交通違例事項。

（三）現時《道路交通（車輛構造及保養）規例》（第374A章）列明不同種類貨車的最大總尺寸。警務人員在快速公路上進行交通執法時，除了根據貨車尺寸，還可透過觀察其型號、車軸數目及車尾標記等特徵來識別其貨車種類。此外，警務人員在作出檢控前亦會檢查車輛牌照或車輛登記資料以作核實。

（四）如上文序言所述，法例現時已限制大型車輛（即全高度超過3.5米的車輛，包括中、重型貨車、巴士等）使用快速公路最右線。政府考慮限制某車種使用快速公路特定車道時，需要在確保快速公路的使用效率、保持交通暢順和保障交通安全之間作出適當平衡，並會按上述考慮留意是否需要進一步對超過一定高度的車輛使用快速公路最右線施加更嚴謹限制。

運輸署的《道路使用者守則》亦提醒駕駛者駕駛時應放遠視線，讓自己可以有較大的觀察範圍確保可以安全切線和有較充裕時間作出所需反應。駕駛者也應與前車保持足夠距離，確保在前車突然減速或停車時也能安全停下，當遇上突發事件或緊急事故時，也有足夠的應變時間。此外，運輸署一直聯同道路安全議會及警務處進行各種宣傳及教育活動，向所有道路使用者（包括輕型貨車駕駛者）推廣，例如出版和派發《道路安全通訊》、在可變信息顯示屏上顯示安全信息、透過社交媒體平台發放資訊等，讓道路使用者了解在道路安全應注意的事項，當中包括快速公路及主幹路的駕駛守則（包括靠左線行駛、中重型貨車在三條或以上行車線的路段不可使用最右線）等。"
LCQ16: Prevention of traffic accidents on expressways,2025-09-10 11:25,2025-09-10 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000189.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Yuet-ming and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  There are views that expressways such as Tuen Mun Road, Tolo Highway and San Tin Highway are traffic black spots in Hong Kong, on which light goods vehicles use the right most lane from time to time, affecting traffic flow capacity and obstructing the view of drivers of following vehicles, thereby posing traffic safety hazards. In view of this, the Government may review the arrangements for the right to use the right most lane of an expressway, with a view to reducing traffic accidents. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the numbers of traffic accidents involving various types of vehicles on expressways and the related casualties in each of the past five years;

(2) as there are views that quite a number of traffic accidents are caused by overtaking, of the respective numbers of prosecutions instituted by the Police in each of the past five years against vehicles for prolonged occupation of the right most lane on an expressway, as well as for illegal use of such traffic lane;

(3) as the existing legislation provides that medium goods vehicles, heavy goods vehicles and buses are prohibited from using the right most lane of an expressway where the carriageway has three or more traffic lanes available unless they are heading for a right side exit, but such restriction does not apply to light goods vehicles, of the means by which the Government distinguishes the classes of vehicles on traffic lanes in the course of enforcement, for example, only by visual observation or by using other auxiliary methods; and

(4) to avoid traffic accidents on expressways caused by goods vehicles obstructing the view of drivers of following vehicles, whether the Government has plans to further prohibit goods vehicles from using the right most lane of expressways, for example, whether it will consider restricting goods vehicles exceeding a certain height from using such lane; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The Road Traffic (Expressway) Regulations (Cap. 374Q) currently govern the use of the right most lane and overtaking on expressways. The general principle is that drivers must keep to the left most lane on an expressway. If a driver needs to overtake a vehicle ahead of him, he must use the lane to the right and return to the left lane as soon as possible. In addition, large vehicles, including medium and heavy goods vehicles and buses, are prohibited from using the right most lane on an expressway with three or more lanes, unless the right most lane joins a diverging lane. After consulting the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Transport Department (TD), my response to the questions raised by the Hon Chan Yuet-ming concerning traffic accidents on expressways and the right most lane arrangements is as follows:

(1) The number of vehicles involved in traffic accident on expressways and the associated casualties by class of vehicles from 2020 to 2024 are at Annex. Overall speaking, the figures for 2020 to 2022 were relatively low, which may have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The rise in traffic accidents in 2023 and 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of minor accidents.

(2) The number of prosecutions relating to the prolonged occupation and unlawful use of the right most lane of expressway from 2020 to 2024 is set out below. The rise in the number of prosecutions for 2022 to 2024 was primarily attributable to the launch of the online traffic offence reporting platform Project PROVE in 2022, which resulted in a higher volume of reports received by the HKPF.

Note: Cap. 374Q regulation 11 stipulates the types of motor vehicles to which it applies, including medium and heavy goods vehicles, private and public buses, motor vehicles towing trailers or other vehicles, motor vehicles with expressway permits, recovery vehicles, and motor cycles, motor tricycles, private cars or light goods vehicles driven by drivers who are authorised to drive by probationary driving licences.

  The HKPF will continue to monitor traffic accident trends and review the effectiveness of enforcement actions which will be suitably adjusted to enhance road safety. At the same time, the HKPF will continue to encourage members of the public to report traffic-related contraventions through various available platforms.

(3) Currently, the Road Traffic (Construction and Maintenance of Vehicles) Regulations (Cap. 374A) stipulate the maximum overall dimensions for various categories of goods vehicles. During traffic enforcement on expressways, police officers would identify the category of goods vehicles based on its dimensions and characteristics such as vehicle model, number of axles, and rear markings. Prior to prosecution, officers would also verify the vehicle class by examining the vehicle licence or registration records to ensure accuracy.

(4) As mentioned in the preamble above, legislation currently restricts large vehicles (i.e. vehicles with an overall height exceeding 3.5 metres, including medium and heavy goods vehicles and buses) from using the right most lane of expressways. When considering restrictions on specific types of vehicles using particular expressway lanes, the Government would strike a balance between ensuring efficient use of expressways, maintaining smooth traffic flow, and safeguarding traffic safety. The Government will take into account the above factors to determine whether more stringent restrictions should be imposed on vehicles exceeding a certain height from using the right most lane of expressways.

  The TD's Road Users' Code also reminds drivers to look well ahead while driving, allowing for a wider field of vision to ensure safe lane changes and more time to react. Drivers should also maintain a sufficient distance from the vehicle ahead to ensure they can stop safely if the vehicle ahead suddenly slows down or stops, providing ample time to respond to emergencies or incidents. In addition, the TD has been collaborating with the Road Safety Council and the HKPF to conduct a range of publicity and educational activities to promote safety to all road users, including light goods vehicle drivers. Activities include publishing and distributing Road Safety Bulletins, displaying safety messages on variable message signs, and disseminating information through social media platforms, so that road users are well-informed of key safety points, which include driving rules on expressways and trunk roads (including keeping to the left lane, medium and heavy goods vehicles not using the right most lane on roads with three or more lanes)."
立法會七題：推廣碳普惠,2025-09-10 11:05,2025-09-10 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000256.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上李浩然議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

環境及生態局副局長在去年十一月二十日本會辯論「盡快啓動碳普惠市場的建設工作」的議員議案時提到，當局會參考不同省市的碳普惠發展及相關經驗，探討在香港擴大例如「綠綠賞」等計劃，加強鼓勵市民實踐綠色低碳生活。有意見認為現時「綠綠賞」計劃旨在鼓勵市民在日常生活中積極參與資源分類回收活動，該計劃有待發展為更全面、成熟且具系統性的碳普惠機制。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一） 鑑於現時市民可通過參與回收活動賺取「綠綠賞」積分以兌換禮品，而當中不同種類的回收物按公斤或件數所對應的「綠綠賞」積分相近，當局基於哪些準則釐定回收物所對應的「綠綠賞」積分；

（二） 據悉目前有私營機構通過計算市民進行回收等環保行為的減碳量給予相應的獎賞，以更好地鼓勵市民減碳，當局會否考慮借鑑相關做法，以回收物的減碳量釐定「綠綠賞」積分，從而提升「綠綠賞」計劃的吸引力和效益；

（三） 會否研究參考內地推出流動應用程式記錄公眾的減碳行為，並擴大「綠綠賞」計劃的適用範圍，將涉及「衣、食、住、行」各類型的綠色低碳行為納入「綠綠賞」積分，以打造立體式的碳普惠生態圈；

（四） 會否考慮爭取更多商戶參與「綠綠賞」計劃，例如以「綠綠賞」積分換取購物券、與更多積分獎賞平台互通積分，以加強市民參與該計劃的誘因，並在鼓勵減碳的同時刺激本地零售消費；及

（五） 會否與粵港澳大灣區其他內地城市協同推出通用的碳普惠策略或機制？

答覆：

主席：

環境保護署（環保署）在二○二○年十一月推出「綠綠賞」電子積分計劃（「綠綠賞」），鼓勵更多市民將減廢回收的習慣融入日常生活。經過環保署多年的努力和得到市民的支持，「綠綠賞」已由一個積分計劃逐漸發展為一個凝聚不同社會界别共同推動建立綠色減廢回收文化的平台，成功推動市民參與廢物分類回收和培養回收習慣。

就李浩然議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）環保署在釐定各種回收物的「綠綠賞」積分獎賞時，主要考慮不同廢物的棄置量、回收率、市場回收價值，以提升整體回收量、減少棄置量，同時避免與市場上私營回收商造成直接競爭。例如，棄置量較高、回收率和市場回收價值均較低的廚餘、膠樽和玻璃樽，其積分會較多，用以鼓勵市民參與回收和養成回收習慣；而其他回收物則採用同一分數。

（二）及（三）政府其中一項主要的減碳策略是減少廢物棄置在堆填區，因此現時市民提交較高棄置量的回收物（如廚餘、膠樽和玻璃樽）可獲得較多「綠綠賞」積分，其基本理念與推動減碳的理念相符。環保署在二○二四年二月起與港鐵旗下的減碳獎賞平台Carbon Wallet合作推出試驗計劃，「綠綠賞」手機應用程式用戶可將「綠綠賞」積分兌換為Carbon Wallet積分，換取各種與低碳生活相關的獎賞，例如免費港鐵單程車票和本地生態遊等。市民也可以透過Carbon Wallet就記錄步行、乘搭港鐵旅程、素食等減碳行為賺取積分。Carbon Wallet和「綠綠賞」的合作可鼓勵市民同時參與回收和減碳行為，帶來顯著的協同效應。我們也留意到為推動公眾綠色低碳生活方式，內地有省市推出應用程式，記錄公眾的低碳生活，如低碳出行、節能節水、家庭光伏安裝使用等，並將其轉化為碳幣。碳幣可兌換禮品，包括商店消費券及網約車優惠券等，其作用主要是推廣綠色低碳生活。為鼓勵更多市民實踐低碳生活，環保署會持續探討與更多減碳相關的獎賞平台合作，更高效地運用公共資源，提升「綠綠賞」的覆蓋率和吸引力。

（四）環保署在二○二四年十二月起與「易賞錢」開展合作，市民可將「綠綠賞」積分兌換成「易賞錢」積分，並在全港超過500間超級市場和零售商店自由換取所需的禮品。此項目推出後，市民反應熱烈。為進一步優化「綠綠賞」，環保署計劃在二○二六年四月全面實現「綠綠賞」禮品兌換電子化，連接更多市場上的獎賞平台，以提供更便捷和多元化的禮品選擇，鼓勵更多市民積極參與回收行動。我們期望通過引入更多與超級市場和零售商店有聯繫的獎賞平台參與積分兌換，不但進一步提升市民參與減碳和回收的積極性，更有助刺激本地零售消費活動。

（五）在探討與內地區域性合作方面，我們將繼續通過粵港環保及應對氣候變化合作小組，與粵方就推行碳普惠保持交流，借鑑不同省市在碳普惠機制方面的先進經驗，探討合作空間和機會，加強鼓勵市民實踐綠色低碳生活。"
LCQ7: Promoting carbon inclusive initiatives,2025-09-10 11:05,2025-09-10 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000260.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Hoey Simon Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

During the debate on the Member's motion on ""Expeditiously kick-starting the construction of a carbon inclusive market"" in this Council on November 20 last year, the Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology stated that the Administration would draw reference from the development and experiences of carbon inclusive initiatives in different provinces and municipalities to explore the possibility of expanding schemes such as the GREEN$ scheme in Hong Kong, with a view to further encouraging members of the public to practise a green and low-carbon lifestyle. There are views that the current GREEN$ scheme, which aims to encourage public participation in resource separation and recycling activities in daily life, has yet to be developed into a more comprehensive, mature and systematic carbon inclusive mechanism. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that members of the public can currently earn GREEN$ Points by participating in recycling activities for redeeming gifts, and that different types of recyclables yield similar number of GREEN$ Points per kilogram or per piece, of the criteria the authorities have adopted to determine the number of GREEN$ Points for various types of recyclables;

(2) as it is learnt that some private organisations currently reward members of the public for their pro-environmental behaviour, such as recycling, by calculating the corresponding carbon reduction, so as to better incentivise the public, whether the authorities will consider drawing on such a practice to base GREEN$ Points on the carbon reduction of recyclables, thereby enhancing the appeal and effectiveness of the GREEN$ scheme;

(3) whether it will consider making reference to the Mainland mobile applications that record public carbon reduction behaviours, and expanding the scope of the GREEN$ scheme to incorporate various green and low-carbon behaviours across the categories of ""clothing, food, accommodation and transport"" into GREEN$ Points, so as to create a multi-dimensional carbon inclusive ecosystem;

(4) whether it will consider encouraging more businesses to participate in the GREEN$ scheme, such as by allowing GREEN$ Points to be used for redeeming shopping vouchers or enabling point interoperability with more reward platforms, so as to strengthen incentives for public participation in the scheme and stimulate local retail consumption while encouraging carbon reduction; and

(5) whether it will collaborate with other Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to introduce a common carbon inclusive strategy or mechanism?

Reply:

President,

The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) launched the GREEN$ Electronic Participation Incentive Scheme (GREEN$ ePIS) in November 2020 to encourage more members of the public to integrate waste reduction and recycling habits into their daily lives. Through years of dedicated efforts by the EPD and support from the public, the GREEN$ ePIS has gradually evolved from an incentive scheme into a platform that facilitates collaborative efforts from various sectors of society to promote green waste reduction and recycling culture. It has successfully motivated public participation in waste separation and recycling, as well as cultivating recycling habits.

The reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Hoey Simon Lee is as follows:

(1) When determining the GREEN$ rewards for various types of recyclables, the EPD primarily considers the disposal quantity, recycling rate, and market value of different wastes. This approach aims to increase overall recycling quantity, reduce disposal quantity, and avoid direct competition with private recyclers in the market. For instance, food waste, plastic bottles and glass bottles, which have high disposal quantity but low recycling rates and market values, will earn more points to encourage public participation in recycling and fostering recycling habits, while other recyclables will use a standard point system.

(2) & (3) One of the Government's key carbon reduction strategies is to minimise waste disposal in landfills. Therefore, members of the public who submit recyclables with higher disposal quantity (such as food waste, plastic bottles and glass bottles) can earn more GREEN$ points, which aligns with the principle of promoting carbon reduction. Since February 2024, the EPD has partnered with Carbon Wallet, a carbon reduction reward platform under the MTR Corporation, to launch a pilot scheme. Users of GREEN$ mobile app can convert their GREEN$ points into Carbon Wallet points for redemption of various rewards related to low-carbon living, such as free MTR single journey tickets and local eco-tours. Members of the public can also earn points through Carbon Wallet for carbon reduction activities such as walking, taking MTR journeys, and adopting vegetarian diet. The collaboration between Carbon Wallet and GREEN$ ePIS encourages the public to take part in both recycling and carbon reduction activities, achieving significant synergy effects. We have also observed that, to promote a green and low-carbon lifestyle among the public, some provinces and municipalities in the Mainland have implemented carbon inclusive initiatives. For instance, they have launched apps to track public daily low-carbon activities, such as low-carbon commuting, energy and water conservation, and residential photovoltaic installations, to convert these actions into carbon coins. These carbon coins can be redeemed for gifts, including shop consumption vouchers and online ride-hailing coupons, with the purpose of promoting a green and low-carbon lifestyle. To encourage greater public participation in practising low-carbon living, the EPD will continue to explore collaborations with more carbon reduction reward platforms to utilise public resources more efficiently and enhance the coverage and appeal of GREEN$ ePIS.

(4)The EPD has collaborated with ""MoneyBack"" since December 2024, enabling members of the public to convert their GREEN$ points into ""MoneyBack"" points, which can be freely redeemed for the required rewards at over 500 supermarkets and retail stores across the territory. The response to this initiative has been enthusiastic. To further enhance the GREEN$ ePIS, the EPD plans to fully digitalise the GREEN$ gift redemption by April 2026, connecting with more reward platforms in the market to offer more convenient and diverse gift options, thereby encouraging greater public participation in recycling activities. We hope that, through introducing more reward platforms linked to supermarkets and retail stores for points redemption, we can not only boost public participation in carbon reduction and recycling, but also help stimulate local retail consumption.

(5) In terms of exploring regional co-operation with the Mainland, we will continue to maintain exchanges with Guangdong on carbon inclusivity implementation through the Hong Kong-Guangdong Joint Working Group on Environmental Protection and Combating Climate Change. We will also draw reference from the experiences in developing carbon inclusivity mechanisms in different provinces and municipalities, and explore potential areas and opportunities for collaboration to further encourage citizens to adopt a green and low-carbon lifestyle."

Honourable Vice-Chairman C Y Leung (Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), Professor Albert Yu (Chairman of the Hong Kong Biotechnology Organization (HKBIO) and President of BIOHK2025), Professor CM Lo (Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau), Professor Herman Hu (Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Professor Hu Shao-ming), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is a true pleasure to see you all again at BIOHK2025. Time flies. This marks the fourth edition of this annual flagship biotechnology convention in Hong Kong. Following the success of past years, I am delighted to witness the continued growth of this event in its scale, diversity and global significance, mirroring the dynamism of Hong Kong's ever-growing innovation and technology (I&T) ecosystem.

  Let me begin with some exciting updates of Hong Kong's I&T developments. With strong support from our motherland, the Plaque Presentation Ceremony for 15 State Key Laboratories (SKLs) in Hong Kong was held last month, recognising our city's world-class capabilities and outstanding achievements in scientific research. Among all, six of the SKLs focus on life and health technologies, covering various aspects such as digestive disease, emerging infectious diseases, and pharmaceutical biotechnology. These SKLs serve as engines of discovery and magnets for talent, translating R&D (research and development) into real-world applications that benefit society.

  Another milestone worth celebrating is the recent announcement by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) that the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster ranks first globally in its Global Innovation Index (GII) 2025. This is truly a remarkable achievement. The top ranking is not only a recognition of the strong innovative capacity of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), but also a powerful endorsement of the GBA as a fertile ground for I&T investment and entrepreneurship, including biotechnology and other frontier technologies.

  For the first time, WIPO has included venture capital investment as a new metric in its GII ranking, highlighting the importance of transforming scientific research into economic value. It also reflects a broader global trend and standard: innovation must be scalable, sustainable and investable. It also affirms that Hong Kong's efforts in fostering effective collaboration among the Government, industry, academic, research and investment sectors are on the right track.

  As you may be aware, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has identified life and health technology as a strategic industry, and we are committed to develop Hong Kong into a global leader in this field. Every step requires strategic investment and long-term vision, and Hong Kong is rising to seize these opportunities. I am confident that our world-class R&D infrastructure such as the InnoHK research clusters and the future Life and Health Technology Research Institute, coupled with proactive funding schemes like the Research, Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme and the upcoming Innovation and Technology Industry-Oriented Fund, will empower Hong Kong to navigate its I&T journey with strength and resilience.

  Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is open for innovation. As we gather here at BIOHK2025, we reaffirm our shared commitment to shaping the future of biotechnology. The opportunities ahead are vast, and the momentum is real. Let us seize the moment together for a healthier and smarter future, starting right here in Hong Kong.

  In closing, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the HKBIO and the relevant stakeholders, including our industry leaders and experts, for their continued efforts and significant contributions to promote the development of biotechnology in Hong Kong. May I wish the BIOHK2025 a resounding success. Thank you."

Speech by CE at 10th Belt and Road Summit (English only),2025-09-10 10:14,2025-09-10 10:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000232.htm," Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the 10th Belt and Road Summit today (September 10):

Honourable Director Zhou Ji (the Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)), Secretary Feng Fei (Secretary of the CPC Hainan Provincial Committee), Vice Minister Yan Dong (Vice Minister of Commerce), Vice Chairman Li Zhen (Vice Chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council), Deputy Secretary General Xiao Weiming (Deputy Secretary General of the National Development and Reform Commission), Commissioner Cui Jianchun (Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR), Professor Frederick Ma (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council), officials and friends from around the world, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. Welcome to Hong Kong, and the 10th Belt and Road Summit.

 Let me first extend a warm welcome to – His Excellency Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol of Cambodia (Deputy Prime Minister and First Vice-Chairman of the Council for the Development of Cambodia), His Excellency Minister Santiphab Phomvihane from Laos (Minister of Finance of Laos), His Excellency Minister Anthony Loke from Malaysia (Minister of Transport of Malaysia), His Excellency Dr Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Sayed from Qatar (Minister of State for Foreign Trade Affairs of Qatar), as well as many senior officials and distinguished leaders from Belt and Road countries here, for this anniversary Summit.

 As the Chinese saying goes, ""ææèªéæ¹ä¾ï¼ä¸äº¦æ¨ä¹"" – ""What a joy to have friends coming from afar"".

 So many friends, I'm delighted to say. This 10th anniversary edition of Hong Kong's Belt and Road Summit brings together more than 6 000 high-profile leaders and participants from governments, international organisations, companies and the global media, here to celebrate a decade of achievements. I'd say that's proof collaboration works. And that this annual Summit delivers.

 Since 2016, Hong Kong's Belt and Road Summit has united governments, businesses, peoples and cultures in collaboration for change. For rewarding opportunities.

 Over the past 10 years, more than 45 000 people from over 120 countries and regions have participated in the Summit. Together, they have presented over 2 800 projects along the Belt and Road, shaping a shared vision through collaboration and connectivity, which are the fundamental values of the Belt and Road Initiative.

 Upholding that spirit, this year's Summit theme is ""Collaborate for Change – Shape a Shared Future"".

 To mark this 10th edition, we are introducing a new session on signature Belt and Road projects. It will be complemented by project investment sessions on energy, natural resources, public utilities and urban development, including Hong Kong's Northern Metropolis, which takes up one-third of Hong Kong's geographical area and is fast rising as an innovation and technology hub.

 Later this morning, we will witness the exchange of 9 MoUs (Memorandum of Understanding) and co-operation agreements, between Hong Kong and Belt and Road countries, on official co-operation in dispute avoidance and resolution, customs, anti-corruption, meteorology, investment promotion, and more. These underline our commitment to the Belt and Road, to enabling co-operation and exchanges for mutual benefit. Also today, some 36 business-to-business agreements and deals will be announced, covering finance, technology, logistics, professional services and education.

 Thanks to projects and deals closed in recent days, their total value is now close to 1 billion US Dollars. And that's just the beginning. The beginning of another decade of business, of investment, and of co-operation.

Trade and investment

 Here in Hong Kong, when we talk business, we mean business. Hong Kong has long thrived as a free port dedicated to multilateralism.

 The HKSAR Government is rapidly expanding Hong Kong's global trade networks. We have signed free trade agreements with 14 Belt and Road countries, and investment agreements with about 20 Belt and Road economies, as well as Comprehensive Double Taxation Agreements with 37 Belt and Road jurisdictions.

 Not surprisingly, our external trade with Belt and Road countries exceeded 276 billion US Dollars last year, up about 80 per cent since 2013, and three times the average growth rate of Hong Kong's overall merchandise trade over the same period. Some 1 400 companies from Belt and Road countries have established a base in Hong Kong to seize these opportunities.

 It helps that Hong Kong is one of the most prolific sources of foreign direct investment in the Belt and Road. In 2023, our outward direct investment in Belt and Road countries and regions was 133 billion US Dollars.

 That's 3.6 times of the amount in 2013 and four times that of Hong Kong's overall outward direct investment growth, a clear sign that global capital converges here and deploys globally.

 We invest as well as connect. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Belt and Road HK Flagship Impact Fund with the Silk Road Fund Company, and initial capital totalling 1 billion US Dollars.

 Last year, our Monetary Authority signed a MoU with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund on a joint 1 billion-US Dollar fund. They will invest in companies with a Hong Kong nexus expanding to Saudi Arabia.

 Last week, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan issued a 2 billion Renminbi dim sum bond in Hong Kong, the first Renminbi bond issued by a government-owned entity from Central Asia.

 That underscores Hong Kong's position as a leading fund-raising hub for Belt and Road economies. That's why more than 100 Belt and Road companies are listed on the HKEX (Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited), with more to come.

 And I believe it is important to reach out to our Belt and Road partners, in person, to let them know what Hong Kong can do for them – for you – whether in key events like this one, or in visiting their countries.

 Since assuming office three years ago, I have visited 12 Belt and Road countries. To most of them, I have led high-level business delegations from Hong Kong, witnessing some 160 MoUs, co-operation agreements and deliverables with the respective economies – many now in development.

 Just this May, I led a joint delegation of Mainland and Hong Kong companies to explore the markets of Qatar and Kuwait, my second visit to the Middle East region.

 Alongside numerous agreements reached during the trip, I'm pleased to note that one of the participants has chosen Hong Kong as its global hub and listed on the HKEX just last month.

 I also witnessed a MoU, less than two weeks ago, between Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Investment and our Belt and Road Office, part of its new signature project collaborations, working directly with governments.

 Major Belt and Road projects and events are turning to Hong Kong for global roadshows. They include the Future Investment Initiative PRIORITY Summit, in 2023, the recent Saudi Super Cup, and LEAP – one of the Middle East's largest tech expos, which chose Hong Kong for its first global edition, LEAP East, to be held next year.

 To support development in the Global South, we continue to expand our world-wide network of trade offices across partner countries.

 Our Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices, Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council work together to connect businesses and projects via Hong Kong.

 Through these networks, our Government ties now extend to some 130 countries, including about 100 Belt and Road countries.

Competitiveness

 To a world of investors, especially our friends from Belt and Road economies, Hong Kong offers a unique blend of professionalism and efficiency.

 Hong Kong has long shone as a resourceful and resilient economy, one of the world's most competitive in the many sectors and industries we commit to.

 That was once again borne out just three months ago, when the International Institute for Management Development put out its 2025 World Competitiveness Yearbook. Hong Kong placed third, globally, up two places from last year.

 In ""government efficiency"" and ""business efficiency"", Hong Kong rose to second overall. And we topped the rankings in ""tax policy"" and ""business legislation"".

 Competitiveness is in Hong Kong's DNA. And central to that competitiveness, is our people, and our ability in nurturing them.

Talent

 In the IMD (International Institute for Management Development)'s annual World Talent Ranking, which came out just yesterday, Hong Kong rose to fourth, globally, up from ninth place last year and 16th place the year before. Moving up 12 places in two years, we have come to our highest-ever standing in the report, ranking number one in Asia.

 Overall, Hong Kong topped the ranking in the percentage of ""graduates in sciences"", and placed among the global top five in the availability of ""finance skills"", the ""remuneration of management"", and the effectiveness of ""management education"".

 Hong Kong's performance, the IMD report said, demonstrates that ""targeted reforms and investment can result in significant gains in talent competitiveness over time"", noting that Hong Kong attracts large numbers of inbound students from abroad, through our outstanding academic achievement. Indeed, Hong Kong is home to five of the world's top 100 universities, which cultivate multi-talented and enterprising young people for our dynamic city.

 And Hong Kong is committed to nurturing future generations from home and abroad. With the HKSAR Government's Belt and Road Scholarship and other programmes, more than 4 000 students from Belt and Road countries are enrolled in our tertiary programmes every year.

 This summer, some 400 students from Belt and Road countries were placed in summer internships here, strengthening our shared Belt and Road talent pool.

 Our targeted reforms on talent cover not only grooming our own, but also attracting a world of professionals to our world city. Since the end of 2022, our enhanced talent admission schemes have received more than 520 000 applications, with over 350 000 approved. More than 230 000 have arrived in Hong Kong over the period, boosting our talent pool and economic growth.

Connectivity

 And of course, Hong Kong also opens its doors wide to travellers who come to our city for business, leisure and more. Last year, Hong Kong welcomed more than 44 million visitors, fourth globally for visitor arrivals by city, winning the world’s best airport immigration service award. Our international airport is the world's busiest air cargo hub, handling 4.9 million tonnes of goods and about 45 per cent of Hong Kong's external trade last year.

 With the three-runway system now in operation, we expect up to 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually in about 10 years' time, with the enhanced capacity to support social and economic growth across Belt and Road countries.

 We have signed 80 bilateral civil aviation agreements and operate flights to some 60 Belt and Road destinations, strengthening our role along the Air Silk Road.

Green and sustainable innovation

 Hong Kong is committed to growth. We are also dedicated to sustainability, to ensuring a healthy development for all. As a green and sustainable innovation and finance hub, Hong Kong is working with Belt and Road partners to build a Green and Innovative Silk Road.

 We provide internationally recognised green building certification, with the flexibility to help countries adapt standards and access green finance. And, for seven consecutive years, Hong Kong has ranked first in Asia in the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged.

Systems

 Hong Kong's success as a premier functional platform for the Belt and Road rests on our unique ""one country, two systems"" framework.

 It allows Hong Kong to maintain a common law jurisdiction with a sophisticated legal sector, and a judiciary that exercises its powers independently, providing the safeguards that investors and projects demand.

 In May, government representatives of over 30 states, many of them from the Belt and Road, gathered in Hong Kong to sign the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation.

 The Organization will be headquartered here, in Hong Kong, as the world's first intergovernmental legal body dedicated to resolving international disputes through mediation.

 The ""one country, two systems"" principle ensures that Hong Kong thrives as an east-meets-west centre for international cultural exchange. With programmes like the Asia+ Festival, which begins next week, we present myriad events showcasing the richness of Asia and Belt and Road regions.

 And the Hong Kong Palace Museum, which houses treasures from Beijing's Forbidden City, is now hosting masterpieces from Qatar's Museum of Islamic Art, Doha. In two months' time, it will also showcase extraordinary collections from seven prominent museums in Egypt. That's just a taste of the cultural exchange, the creative dialogue, that Hong Kong delivers!

The Ideal Belt and Road Hub

 Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is the ideal Belt and Road hub. As the only world city that converges both the China advantage and the global advantage, Hong Kong stands as the premier gateway for co-operation, bridging people, trade, business, education, culture and values across the region, connecting Asia and the world. We are a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" for high-quality collaborations worldwide.

 Our ""dual superpower"" of connecting and value-adding means Hong Kong is more than a link between capital and projects. We also inject vigour, innovation and sustainability, adding strategic value to everything we do.

 Hong Kong will continue to drive high-quality development along the Belt and Road. That's our promise towards a brighter future. Together with you.

 My thanks to our Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Belt and Road Office and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council for making this Summit such a flagship international event over the past decade. And, I'm confident, for many decades to come.

 Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you all a rewarding Summit, and a memorable stay in Hong Kong.

 Thank you."
Speech by CE at 10th Belt and Road Summit (English only) (with photos),2025-09-10 10:14,2025-09-10 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000232.htm," Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the 10th Belt and Road Summit today (September 10):

Honourable Director Zhou Ji (the Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)), Secretary Feng Fei (Secretary of the CPC Hainan Provincial Committee), Vice Minister Yan Dong (Vice Minister of Commerce), Vice Chairman Li Zhen (Vice Chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council), Deputy Secretary General Xiao Weiming (Deputy Secretary General of the National Development and Reform Commission), Commissioner Cui Jianchun (Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR), Professor Frederick Ma (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council), officials and friends from around the world, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. Welcome to Hong Kong, and the 10th Belt and Road Summit.

 Let me first extend a warm welcome to – His Excellency Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol of Cambodia (Deputy Prime Minister and First Vice-Chairman of the Council for the Development of Cambodia), His Excellency Minister Santiphab Phomvihane from Laos (Minister of Finance of Laos), His Excellency Minister Anthony Loke from Malaysia (Minister of Transport of Malaysia), His Excellency Dr Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Sayed from Qatar (Minister of State for Foreign Trade Affairs of Qatar), as well as many senior officials and distinguished leaders from Belt and Road countries here, for this anniversary Summit.

 As the Chinese saying goes, ""ææèªéæ¹ä¾ï¼ä¸äº¦æ¨ä¹"" – ""What a joy to have friends coming from afar"".

 So many friends, I'm delighted to say. This 10th anniversary edition of Hong Kong's Belt and Road Summit brings together more than 6 000 high-profile leaders and participants from governments, international organisations, companies and the global media, here to celebrate a decade of achievements. I'd say that's proof collaboration works. And that this annual Summit delivers.

 Since 2016, Hong Kong's Belt and Road Summit has united governments, businesses, peoples and cultures in collaboration for change. For rewarding opportunities.

 Over the past 10 years, more than 45 000 people from over 120 countries and regions have participated in the Summit. Together, they have presented over 2 800 projects along the Belt and Road, shaping a shared vision through collaboration and connectivity, which are the fundamental values of the Belt and Road Initiative.

 Upholding that spirit, this year's Summit theme is ""Collaborate for Change – Shape a Shared Future"".

 To mark this 10th edition, we are introducing a new session on signature Belt and Road projects. It will be complemented by project investment sessions on energy, natural resources, public utilities and urban development, including Hong Kong's Northern Metropolis, which takes up one-third of Hong Kong's geographical area and is fast rising as an innovation and technology hub.

 Later this morning, we will witness the exchange of 9 MoUs (Memorandum of Understanding) and co-operation agreements, between Hong Kong and Belt and Road countries, on official co-operation in dispute avoidance and resolution, customs, anti-corruption, meteorology, investment promotion, and more. These underline our commitment to the Belt and Road, to enabling co-operation and exchanges for mutual benefit. Also today, some 36 business-to-business agreements and deals will be announced, covering finance, technology, logistics, professional services and education.

 Thanks to projects and deals closed in recent days, their total value is now close to 1 billion US Dollars. And that's just the beginning. The beginning of another decade of business, of investment, and of co-operation.

Trade and investment

 Here in Hong Kong, when we talk business, we mean business. Hong Kong has long thrived as a free port dedicated to multilateralism.

 The HKSAR Government is rapidly expanding Hong Kong's global trade networks. We have signed free trade agreements with 14 Belt and Road countries, and investment agreements with about 20 Belt and Road economies, as well as Comprehensive Double Taxation Agreements with 37 Belt and Road jurisdictions.

 Not surprisingly, our external trade with Belt and Road countries exceeded 276 billion US Dollars last year, up about 80 per cent since 2013, and three times the average growth rate of Hong Kong's overall merchandise trade over the same period. Some 1 400 companies from Belt and Road countries have established a base in Hong Kong to seize these opportunities.

 It helps that Hong Kong is one of the most prolific sources of foreign direct investment in the Belt and Road. In 2023, our outward direct investment in Belt and Road countries and regions was 133 billion US Dollars.

 That's 3.6 times of the amount in 2013 and four times that of Hong Kong's overall outward direct investment growth, a clear sign that global capital converges here and deploys globally.

 We invest as well as connect. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Belt and Road HK Flagship Impact Fund with the Silk Road Fund Company, and initial capital totalling 1 billion US Dollars.

 Last year, our Monetary Authority signed a MoU with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund on a joint 1 billion-US Dollar fund. They will invest in companies with a Hong Kong nexus expanding to Saudi Arabia.

 Last week, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan issued a 2 billion Renminbi dim sum bond in Hong Kong, the first Renminbi bond issued by a government-owned entity from Central Asia.

 That underscores Hong Kong's position as a leading fund-raising hub for Belt and Road economies. That's why more than 100 Belt and Road companies are listed on the HKEX (Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited), with more to come.

 And I believe it is important to reach out to our Belt and Road partners, in person, to let them know what Hong Kong can do for them – for you – whether in key events like this one, or in visiting their countries.

 Since assuming office three years ago, I have visited 12 Belt and Road countries. To most of them, I have led high-level business delegations from Hong Kong, witnessing some 160 MoUs, co-operation agreements and deliverables with the respective economies – many now in development.

 Just this May, I led a joint delegation of Mainland and Hong Kong companies to explore the markets of Qatar and Kuwait, my second visit to the Middle East region.

 Alongside numerous agreements reached during the trip, I'm pleased to note that one of the participants has chosen Hong Kong as its global hub and listed on the HKEX just last month.

 I also witnessed a MoU, less than two weeks ago, between Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Investment and our Belt and Road Office, part of its new signature project collaborations, working directly with governments.

 Major Belt and Road projects and events are turning to Hong Kong for global roadshows. They include the Future Investment Initiative PRIORITY Summit, in 2023, the recent Saudi Super Cup, and LEAP – one of the Middle East's largest tech expos, which chose Hong Kong for its first global edition, LEAP East, to be held next year.

 To support development in the Global South, we continue to expand our world-wide network of trade offices across partner countries.

 Our Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices, Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council work together to connect businesses and projects via Hong Kong.

 Through these networks, our Government ties now extend to some 130 countries, including about 100 Belt and Road countries.

​特區政府強烈不滿和反對歐洲聯盟委員會年度報告,2025-09-09 23:13,2025-09-09 23:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900882.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（九月九日）就歐洲聯盟（歐盟）委員會及歐洲聯盟外交與安全政策高級代表發表所謂年度報告中針對香港特區維護國家安全、保障人權等方面的不實和偏頗內容，表示強烈不滿和反對。

特區政府發言人強調：「香港特區是中華人民共和國不可分離的部分，在『一國兩制』下是一個享有高度自治權、直轄於中央人民政府的地方行政區域。『一國兩制』的實施以《憲法》和《基本法》為法律依據，它們為基本權利和自由提供憲制上的保證，包括法律面前一律平等的權利保證，及其在法治和獨立司法權之下得以鞏固。」

「特區政府堅定不移全面準確實施《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》，在依法有效應對、打擊、阻嚇和防止危害國家安全的行為和活動的同時，依法保障香港居民的權利和自由，確保『一國兩制』實踐行穩致遠。特區政府強烈敦促歐盟尊重事實並遵從它們口口聲聲奉行的國際法和國際關係的基本準則，立即停止長臂管轄、干涉純屬中國內政的香港事務。」

維護司法公正和法治精神

特區政府發言人指出：「特區政府維護獨立的司法權，全力支持司法機構依法獨立行使審判權，維護司法公正和法治精神。建立香港特區維護國家安全的機制不會損害獨立司法權，香港特區司法制度亦繼續受《基本法》保障。法官在處理危害國家安全犯罪案件時，一如其他案件，都是獨立公正地履行司法職責，不受任何干涉。五年來的實踐證明，法院嚴格按照上述原則處理涉及《香港國安法》的案件。」

「事實上，普通法司法區早已確立司法機關須尊重行政機關對國家安全的判斷這個原則，而上訴法庭在二○二四年五月的一項重要判決中裁定，法院在尊重行政機關對國家安全的判斷的同時，至少在三個範疇下法院會作出判決：第一，涉及受措施影響人士的基本權利；第二，涉及公平審訊規定的爭議；第三，涉及司法公開的問題。」

發言人強調：「香港法治固若金湯、歷久不變。香港法治並無任何倒退，任何指稱香港正成為一個『極權』城市的說法絕非事實。香港的普通法制度是多年來由包括各級法院法官在內的香港司法界和法律界全體共同努力打造和維護，不會因個別海外非常任法官離任而有所改變。儘管有法官離任，兩位海外非常任法官剛於去年和今年獲委任。」

「司法機關依法獨立行使審判權，而所有面對刑事指控的人都享有接受公平審訊的權利。法院嚴格按照證據和所有適用法律判案。案件不會因涉案者的職業、政治理念或背景而在處理上有所不同。控方有責任在毫無合理疑點下證明被告人犯罪，被告人才可被法庭定罪。」

保障權利和自由

特區政府發言人表示：「特區政府堅定維護香港居民受到法律保障的權利和自由。自香港回歸祖國以來，人權一直受到《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實憲制保障。香港特區維護國家安全的法律亦特別重視人權。《香港國安法》第四條和《維護國家安全條例》第2條清楚訂明香港特區維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》、《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港，有關言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會等方面的權利和自由。然而，與世界其他地方一樣，有關權利和自由並非絕對，《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》亦清楚訂明，在有必要保障國家安全、公共安全、公共秩序或他人的權利和自由等情況下，可以依法限制部分權利和自由。」

「但事實上，自《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》實施以來，本港的傳媒環境蓬勃依然。惟部分別有用心人士卻刻意捏造有關香港新聞和言論自由的事實。與世界其他地方一樣，新聞和言論自由並非絕對，傳媒與其他人一樣都有義務遵守所有法律。只要不違法，傳媒繼續享有評論和批評政府施政的自由，全然不受限制。法庭在相關案件的裁決理由也引用了歐洲人權法院關於新聞自由的判例，指出即使是報道涉及備受公眾關注的重要議題，在《歐洲人權公約》下也不享有完全不受限制的言論自由；最重要的一點是，新聞工作者必須按『負責任新聞作業』原則真誠地行事，以準確事實為基礎，並提供準確可靠的資訊，方可獲言論和新聞自由權利保障。」

維護國家安全相關法律

特區政府發言人表示：「根據《聯合國憲章》為基礎的國際法及國際關係，每個國家都會制定維護國家安全法律，這既是主權國家的固有權利，也是國際慣例。歐盟對香港特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制指手畫腳，全然漠視香港特區訂立相關法律的憲制責任和實際需要，以及在維護國家安全的相關法律訂立後，對經濟發展和人權保障所帶來的正面效果，是實實在在的雙重標準。」

「中央二○二○年果斷制定《香港國安法》，特區政府隨即公布實施，填補了香港特區維護國家安全法律制度和執行機制的短板漏洞，效果立竿見影，止暴制亂，讓香港居民重新享有在黑暴期間被剝奪的權利和自由，發揮止暴制亂的作用。《香港國安法》的公布實施成為香港『由亂到治』的分水嶺，『一法安香江』。在二○二四年，香港特區切實履行憲制責任訂立《維護國家安全條例》，完善了特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制。事實上，在《基本法》第二十三條立法諮詢期間，有98.6%的意見表示支持及提出正面意見，反映立法在社會有很強的共識，亦是民心所向。」

「香港特區是法治社會，一直秉持有法必依、違法必究的原則。《香港國安法》第五條和《維護國家安全條例》第2條明確訂明防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪，應當堅持法治原則。香港特區執法部門一直根據證據、嚴格依照法律，以及按有關的人或單位的行為而採取執法行動，與其政治立場、背景或職業無關。」

「由於黎智英案、『35+』串謀顛覆國家政權案及支聯會案等所涉及的法律程序尚在進行中，任何人均不宜評論有關案件。特區政府必須強調，所有案件均嚴格根據證據和依照法律處理，律政司按《基本法》第六十三條主管刑事檢控工作，不受任何干涉，所有檢控決定是基於所有可接納的證據和適用法律進行客觀分析後作出。檢控機關和司法機關嚴格履行《香港國安法》第四十二條第一款的責任，確保所有危害國家安全犯罪案件得到公正、及時辦理，過程中充分尊重被告人依法行使各項程序權利，絕對不存在所謂『延誤審訊』的情況。」

「《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》下危害國家安全罪行的域外效力，完全符合國際法原則、國際慣例和各國各地區通行做法，實屬必要和正當，並與世界其他國家和地區一致。包括歐盟成員國在內眾多國家的國家安全法律，同樣根據『屬人管轄』和『保護管轄』等原則，具有域外效力。」

「警方作為特區維護國家安全的執法部門，有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌危害國家安全的惡行。該等一直潛藏外地的潛逃者被通緝，是因為他們在當地繼續公然從事危害國家安全的勾當，包括煽動分裂國家及請求外國對中華人民共和國及香港特區進行『制裁』、封鎖及採取其他敵對行動，並繼續肆意勾結外部勢力包庇其惡行。他們危害國家安全的惡行昭然若揭，明顯嚴重危害國家安全，無庸置疑。警方作為特區維護國家安全的執法部門，有責任依法進行通緝，及有需要採取一切合法措施，包括《維護國家安全條例》第89條下指明的措施，強烈打擊有關潛逃行為，其做法有理有據，實屬必要和正當。而香港特區維護國家安全相關法律的域外效力，完全符合國際法原則、國際慣例和各國各地區通行做法。不少國家也會就不同的通緝犯施行類似措施，包括撤銷護照。」

「懲教署一直極為重視在囚人士的安全及健康。不論在囚人士的身分、年齡和國籍，署方一直致力為其提供安全、人道、合適和健康的羈管環境，包括提供良好的通風環境、合適和及時的醫療支援。為某囚犯的利益或為維持秩序或紀律，懲教署署長根據《監獄規例》第68B條可作出有關囚犯不應與其他囚犯交往的安排（即所謂的『單獨監禁』）。有關安排的其中一個目的是保障囚犯的人身安全和福祉，可由該囚犯自行提出要求、由懲教署署長依法考慮後審批，或由懲教署署長根據法律規定及程序，在考量了相關的因素後而作出。懲教署也設有一系列機制，例如透過獨立訪客（即太平紳士）定期巡視的安排，以確保在囚人士的權利獲得保障。」

「至於煽動罪方面，香港特區法庭於不同案件中均已確認有關煽動的條文符合《基本法》和《香港人權法案》中有關保障人權的條文，亦確認在維護國家安全和保障言論自由之間已取得相稱而合理的平衡。有關罪行絕非要壓制僅屬根據客觀事實而對政府作出正當批評的言論。事實上，上訴法庭在最近的判決指出，『煽動意圖』的定義與表達自由的基本權利一起正確閱讀時，清晰顯示，批評政府、司法行政包括法院判決，或參與辯論或提出對政府政策或決定的異議，無論多麼強烈、有力或尖銳，都不構成煽動意圖，這進一步澄清了合法和非法言論之間的區別。」

「關於上訴法庭就一首歌曲頒布的臨時禁制令，特區政府重申禁制令針對與該歌曲有關的四項指明刑事行為。為維護國家安全這個正當目的，禁制令是必要、合理、合法、相稱及符合相關人權法案的要求。國際上，很多司法管轄區都有法律機制禁止違法、具有冒犯性、煽動暴力、煽動仇恨或損害公衆利益的信息傳播。例如歐盟的《數字服務法案》規定中介服務供應商收到有關當局要求對非法內容採取行動後，必須及時通知當局其所作的行動；並要求主機服務商須建立機制打擊非法內容及在收到通知後須及時採取應對行動，包括移除及封鎖相關內容。歐盟對特區政府的正當法律行動作出無理批評顯然是持有雙重標準。」

「至於被法庭依法判處在監獄服刑的在囚人士，從來沒有必然獲得提早釋放或者減刑的權利。懲教署署長不轉介犯危害國家安全罪行的在囚人士的個案予監管釋囚委員會，是一項考慮到國家安全的重要性的預防措施，亦有助相關在囚人士改過自新。不轉介有關個案並無增加在囚人士的刑期，也不能被視為對在囚人士的懲罰。法庭亦同意懲教署署長根據《監獄條例》及《監管釋囚條例》賦予的職權行使職務時有責任維護國家安全，亦必須將國家安全視為最重要因素，並給予適當考慮。懲教署一直依法和按既定機制處理有關個案，在決定提早釋放個別在囚人士是否不會不利於國家安全，署長會考慮個案的實際情況及所有相關資料和因素，嚴格依照所有相關法律、公平公正地處理每宗個案。」

「外部勢力『以港遏華』的圖謀無法得逞，只好抹黑詆毀《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》及特區其他相關法律。但事實擺在眼前，香港市民和國際投資者的眼睛都是雪亮的。《香港國安法》實施五年多以來，恢復了香港市民在『黑暴』期間無法享有的權利和自由，以及讓廣大香港市民生活和經濟活動迅速回復正常，營商環境得以恢復並不斷提升。根據《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港的排名躍升兩位至全球第三；香港在全球國際金融中心中位列三甲，並在全球首次公開招股市場中位列前四名。這些國際認可的成就都是建基於《香港國安法》及其他特區相關法律和維護國家安全工作為香港社會帶來的自由、安穩，亦給予世界各地的投資者和企業充足的信心在香港發展業務，及善用香港『一國兩制』的制度優勢開拓包括粵港澳大灣區在內的內地廣大市場。」

「歐盟一再通過所謂年度報告詆毀盡責、忠誠和依法維護國家安全的香港特區，而對相關法律讓廣大香港居民生活和經濟活動回復正常、營商環境恢復的實況置若罔聞。此實乃典型的虛偽『雙標』。歐盟必須立即重回正道，停止抹黑香港特區維護國家安全相關法律和工作。」

加強國民教育

特區政府發言人指出：「學校是學生學習和成長的地方，學校有責任提供安全有序的校園環境和氛圍，防止政治干預或違法活動入侵校園，以保障學生福祉。國民教育一直是香港中小學及幼稚園課程重要部分，以加強學生對國情、歷史和文化、《憲法》和《基本法》、以及國家安全的認識，建立文化自信，提升國民身分認同，培育他們成為德才兼備，有承擔、有視野、愛國愛港的新一代。此外，教師是學生的重要楷模，肩負知識傳承、熏陶品德的重要職責，特區政府有責任確保教師的專業操守。實施包括國家安全教育在內的國民教育，是世界各地教育當局正當合理的責任，不同地方對實施國家安全教育及培養學生國民身分，包括對各自的憲法、自身歷史、文化、地理等知識，均十分重視。」

「學術自由是香港一直推崇的重要社會價值，亦是香港高等教育界賴以成功的基石。自《香港國安法》實施以來，本港學者和專上院校繼續與境外和校外合作夥伴進行正常交流活動。同時，本地專上院校已採取一系列措施，將國家安全教育納入學生的學習範圍，以履行其法定責任。各院校在課程設計上享有自主，特區政府鼓勵其就國家安全教育為學生提供多元化的學習機會。」

保持長期繁榮穩定

​特區政府發言人強調：「自香港回歸祖國以來，特區政府按照《憲法》和《基本法》，全面準確、堅定不移貫徹落實『一國兩制』、『港人治港』、高度自治的方針，保持香港長期繁榮穩定，並已踏上由治及興的新階段。

「在『一國兩制』下，香港擁有『背靠祖國、聯通世界』此得天獨厚的顯著優勢。香港是世界貿易組織及亞太區經濟合作組織的單獨成員。香港會憑藉連接內地與世界各地的獨特優勢，繼續充分發揮其作為『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的角色。實施《香港國安法》為香港帶來的穩定環境有利於香港與世界各地達致強勁且持續的貿易增長，包括歐盟繼續是香港最大的貿易夥伴之一。此外，根據菲沙研究所發布的《世界經濟自由度 2024年度報告》，香港是全球最自由經濟體，在「國際貿易自由」及「監管」均位列首位。在《2025年世界競爭力年報》中，香港整體排名較去年上升兩位，晉身全球首三位最具競爭力的經濟體，在「商業法規」和「税務政策」更是排名全球第一。香港會繼續發揮其優勢以鞏固國際金融、航運和貿易中心等地位，以及積極融入國家發展大局包括參與粵港澳大灣區建設、『一帶一路』高質量發展等。特區政府亦會繼續全力增強發展動能，及更積極進取地招商引才，以提升香港競爭力。」

​​發言人重申：「任何外國或外部勢力詆毀香港，試圖破壞香港繁榮穩定，只會自暴其短，理屈詞窮，絕不會得逞。特區政府定當繼續堅定履職，堅持法治原則，致力確保『一國兩制』、『港人治港』、高度自治的方針實踐行穩致遠，更好結合『有為政府』和『高效市場』，更積極進取地招商引才，提升香港競爭力，推動香港經濟走上更高台階，為市民謀幸福，為香港謀發展。」"
HKSAR Government strongly disapproves of and rejects annual report of European Commission,2025-09-09 23:13,2025-09-09 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900890.htm,"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (September 9) strongly disapproved of and rejected the unfounded and biased content targeting the HKSAR's safeguarding of national security, human rights, etc, in the so-called annual report on Hong Kong issued by the European Commission and the High Representative of the European Union(EU)for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government stressed, ""The HKSAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China. It is a local administrative region that enjoys a high degree of autonomy under 'one country, two systems' and comes directly under the Central People's Government. The legal basis for implementing 'one country, two systems' comprises the Constitution and the Basic Law, which provide constitutional guarantee for fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to equality before the law, and is buttressed by the rule of law and independent judicial power.

""The HKSAR Government will resolutely, fully and faithfully implement the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) so as to address, combat, deter and prevent in accordance with the law acts and activities endangering national security. At the same time, it will safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people in accordance with the law. Its overarching goal is to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of 'one country, two systems'. The HKSAR Government strongly urges the EU to respect facts, abide by the international law and basic norms governing international relations that it claims to uphold, and immediately stop its long-arm jurisdiction and interference in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs.""

Safeguarding Due Administration of Justice and Rule of Law

The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""The HKSAR Government safeguards independent judicial power and fully supports the Judiciary in exercising its judicial power independently, safeguarding the due administration of justice and the rule of law. Establishing the mechanism for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR will not undermine the independent judicial power. Our judicial system continues to be protected by the Basic Law. When adjudicating cases concerning offence endangering national security, as in any other cases, judges remain independent and impartial in performing their judicial duties, free from any interference. The implementation of the HKNSL over the past five years has proven that the courts have handled all the cases involving the HKNSL strictly in accordance with the above principles.

""As a matter of fact, the principle of judicial deference to the executive's assessment on national security is well established in common law jurisdictions. The Court of Appeal in an important judgment decided in May 2024 that there are at least three areas where the court would make judgment while giving the executive deference on assessment on national security: first, where a fundamental right of the person affected by the measure is engaged; second, where the requirement of a fair trial is in issue; and third, where the question of open justice is raised.

The spokesman stressed, ""The rule of law in Hong Kong is strong and robust, and withstands the test of time. There is no truth in saying that there is any decline in the rule of law in Hong Kong, or that Hong Kong is becoming a 'totalitarian' city. Hong Kong's common law system has been built and maintained over the years by the joint efforts of the Judiciary and legal professions, including judges at all levels of courts, and it will not be changed because of the departure of individual overseas non-permanent judges. Despite some departures, two overseas non-permanent judges were appointed last year and this year.

""The Judiciary exercises judicial power independently in accordance with the law, and everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to a fair hearing. The courts decide cases strictly in accordance with the evidence and all applicable laws. Cases will never be handled any differently owing to the profession, political beliefs or background of the persons involved. The prosecution has the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission of an offence before a defendant may be convicted by the court.""

Safeguarding Rights and Freedoms

The HKSAR Government spokesman said, ""The HKSAR Government steadfastly safeguards the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people as protected under the law. Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, human rights in the city have always been robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. At the same time, HKSAR's laws to safeguard national security attach special importance to human rights. Article 4 of the HKNSL and the section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and that the rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, shall be protected in accordance with the law. Nonetheless, just as the case with other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. The ICCPR also expressly states that some of them may be subject to restrictions as prescribed by law that are necessary for the protection of national security, public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms of others, etc.

""Since the implementation of the HKNSL and the SNSO, the media landscape in Hong Kong has remained vibrant. However, some people with ulterior motives deliberately fabricated facts about freedom of the press and speech in Hong Kong. Like all other places in the world, freedom of the press and speech are not absolute. The media, like everyone else, has an obligation to abide by all the laws. The media continue to enjoy the freedom to comment on and criticise government policies without any restriction, as long as this is not in violation of the law. The court further cited precedents from the European Court of Human Rights regarding press freedom in the reasons for verdict of a relevant case, pointing out that the European Convention on Human Rights does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of speech even with respect to press coverage on matters of serious public concern. The most crucial point is that journalists must act in good faith and on accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism' in order to enjoy the protection of their rights to freedom of speech and press freedom.""

Laws safeguarding national security

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""In accordance with international law and international relations based on the Charter of the United Nations, it is each and every sovereign state's inherent right to enact laws safeguarding national security, and it is also an international practice. The EU exposed their double standards as they pointed fingers at Hong Kong's legal system and enforcement mechanisms to safeguard national security, while totally disregarding the constitutional duty and practical needs of the city to legislate, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the national security legislation on economic development and the protection of human rights.

""In 2020, the Central Authorities decisively enacted the HKNSL and the HKSAR Government soon afterwards promulgated it for implementation. The HKNSL has addressed the shortcomings and plugged the loopholes in the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security of the HKSAR. Its effect in stopping violence and curbing disorder was immediate, and has restored the rights and freedoms that Hong Kong citizens were unable to enjoy during the period of 'black-clad violence'. The implementation of HKNSL was a 'watershed moment' in Hong Kong's transition from chaos to order, as stability and safety of the city have been restored by the law. In 2024, the HKSAR fulfilled its constitutional duty by enacting the SNSO, thereby improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security. As a matter of fact, during the public consultation of the Basic Law Article 23 legislation, 98.6 per cent of the submissions of opinions showed support and gave positive comments, reflecting a strong consensus in society for the legislation, and it is also the aspiration of the people.

""Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law and has always adhered to the principle that 'laws must be obeyed and lawbreakers be held accountable'. Article 5 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security. The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, which have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation.

""As the legal proceedings concerning cases involving Lai Chee-ying, '35+' conspiracy to commit subversion and the Hong Kong Alliance are still ongoing, it is inappropriate for any person to comment on the details of the cases. The HKSAR Government must emphasise that all cases are handled strictly on the basis of evidence and in accordance with the law. The Department of Justice takes charge of criminal prosecutions, free from any interference by virtue of Article 63 of the Basic Law. All prosecutorial decisions are based on an objective analysis of all admissible evidence and applicable laws. All cases concerning offence endangering national security will be handled by the prosecution and judicial authorities of the HKSAR in a fair and timely manner in strict compliance with Article 42(1) of the HKNSL, with the procedural rights of defendants exercised in accordance with the law fully respected throughout the process. The situation of so-called 'delays in trials' does not exist at all.

""Extraterritorial effect for the offences under HKNSL and SNSO fully aligns with the principles of international law, international practice and common practice adopted in various countries and regions. It is both necessary and legitimate, and is also in line with those of other countries and regions around the world. It can be seen that the national security laws of various countries, including the member states of the EU, also have extraterritorial effect under the 'personality principle' and the 'protective principle'.

""As the law enforcement department of the HKSAR safeguarding national security, the Police are duty bound to pursue the liability of those who have allegedly endangered national security overseas. Those absconders are hiding overseas are wanted because they continue to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security, including inciting secession and requesting foreign countries to impose 'sanctions' or blockade and engage in other hostile activities against the People's Republic of China and the HKSAR. More so, they continue to collude with external forces to be covered for their evil deeds. Their malicious acts to endanger national security have been seen through by all, and there is no doubt that they have clearly and seriously endangered national security. As the law enforcement department of the HKSAR safeguarding national security, the Police are duty bound to put the persons concerned on the wanted list in accordance with the law and it is necessary to take all lawful measures, including the measures specified under section 89 of the SNSO, to strongly combat the acts of abscondment. The action is fully justified, necessary and legitimate. The extraterritorial effect for the laws safeguarding national security fully aligns with the principles of international law, international practice and common practice adopted in various countries and regions. Quite a number of countries would also impose similar measures on wanted criminals, including cancellation of passports.

""The Correctional Services Department (CSD) attaches great importance to the safety and health of persons-in-custody (PICs). Regardless of the identities, ages and nationalities of PICs, the CSD is committed to ensuring that the custodial environment is secure, safe, humane, appropriate and healthy, and that an environment with good ventilation, as well as appropriate and timely medical support will be provided. In the interests of a particular prisoner or for the maintenance of good order and discipline, the Commissioner of Correctional Services is empowered to make arrangements under rule 68B of the Prison Rules that such prisoner should not associate with other prisoners (i.e. the so-called 'solitary confinement'). One of the purposes of the relevant arrangement is to ensure the personal safety and well-being of the PICs, which can be requested by the PICs themselves and approved by the Commissioner after considering the matter in accordance with the law; or the Commissioner may make such arrangements after considering the relevant factors in accordance with the legal requirements and procedures. The CSD has also put in place an established mechanism, including regular independent visitors, namely Justices of the Peace, who inspect the prisons to ensure the rights of PICs are protected.

""As regards the sedition offence, the courts of the HKSAR have ruled in different cases that the provisions relating to sedition are consistent with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights on the protection of human rights, and that a proportionate and reasonable balance has been struck between safeguarding national security and protection of the freedom of speech. The offence does not in any way seek to silence expressions of what are merely genuine criticisms against the Government based on objective facts. In fact, the court's reasons for verdict in a recent Court of Appeal case has pointed out that criticising the Government, the administration of justice including court judgments, or engaging in debates about or raising objections to Government policies or decisions, however strong, vigorous or critical they may be, does not constitute a seditious intention. This provides further clarity in differentiating between lawful and unlawful speech.

""As regards the interim injunction relating to a song granted by the Court of Appeal, the HKSAR Government reiterates that the interim injunction covers four types of specified criminal acts in relation to the concerned song. The injunction pursues the legitimate aim of safeguarding national security and is necessary, reasonable, legitimate, proportionate and consistent with the requirements of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. Internationally, many jurisdictions also have legal mechanisms in place to prohibit the dissemination of information that is illegal, offensive, incites violence, incites hatred or harms the public interest. For example, the EU's Digital Services Act stipulates that upon the receipt of an order to act against a specific item(s) of illegal content, providers of intermediary services shall inform the authority of any effect given to the order without undue delay; it also requires providers of hosting services to put mechanisms in place to combat illegal contents and respond to notices received in a timely manner, including removing and disabling access to the relevant content. The unreasonable criticisms made by the EU against the legitimate legal actions taken by the HKSAR Government shows clearly the double standards held.

""As for prisoners sentenced to imprisonment by the court in accordance with the law, they would not have a right to remission. Non-referral of a prisoner having committed offence endangering national security case to the Post-release Supervision Board is a preventive measure and serves as an adjunct to the rehabilitation of the prisoner. The non-referral does not of itself increase the sentence and should not be regarded as punishment. The court also agreed that the Commissioner of Correctional Services, in performing a function conferred by the Prisons Ordinance and the Post-release Supervision of Prisoners Ordinance, has a duty to safeguard national security and must regard national security as the most important factor and give appropriate consideration to it accordingly. The Correctional Services Department has been handling relevant cases in accordance with the law and established mechanisms. In deciding whether the early release of individual prisoners would be contrary to the interests of national security, the Commissioner will carry out his relevant duties in strict accordance with the laws and deal with every case fairly and impartially.

""The attempts by external forces to 'use Hong Kong to contain China' are doomed to fail, leaving them with no option but to smear the HKNSL, SNSO and other related laws. However, the facts are clear for all to see, and both Hong Kong citizens and international investors have a discerning eye. Over five years of its implementation, the HKNSL has restored the rights and freedoms that Hong Kong citizens were unable to enjoy during the period of 'black-clad violence', and has enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community at large to swiftly return to normal and the business environment to be restored and improved continuously. According to the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025, Hong Kong's ranking improved by two places to third globally. Also, Hong Kong continues to rank among the top three international financial centres and comes fourth in initial public offering in the world. These internationally recognised achievements are built upon the freedom and stability brought to Hong Kong society by the HKNSL, other relevant laws of the HKSAR, and the work of safeguarding national security. They also provide investors and businesses worldwide with ample confidence to develop their operations in Hong Kong and leverage on Hong Kong's institutional advantages under 'one country, two systems' to explore the vast mainland China market, including the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

""The EU repeatedly uses its soâcalled annual reports to smear the HKSAR, which has been faithfully, dutifully and lawfully safeguarding national security, while turning a blind eye to the fact that the relevant laws have allowed the daily lives and economic activities of the broad masses of Hong Kong residents to return to normal and have restored the business environment. This is a classic example of hypocritical ""double standards"". The EU must immediately act reasonably and sensibly, and stop smearing the laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR.

Enhancing National Education

The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""Schools are places for students to learn and grow. It is the obligation of schools to provide a safe and orderly school environment and atmosphere, and to maintain a campus free from political interference or illegal activities, for safeguarding students' well-being. National education has been an important part of the curricula for primary and secondary schools as well as kindergartens with a view to deepening our students' understanding of the country's national affairs, history and culture, the Constitution and the Basic Law, as well as national security, thereby building up students' cultural confidence to foster a sense of national identity, and cultivating them into a new generation that is able and virtuous with a sense of responsibility, visions and love for the country and the city. Teachers are also important role models for their students, playing a vital role in passing on knowledge and nurturing students' character. The HKSAR Government has the responsibility to ensure the professional conduct of teachers. Implementation of national education, including national security education, is the legitimate duty of education authorities all over the world. Different places attach great importance to implementing national security education and developing their students' sense of national identity, including knowledge of their respective constitution, their own history, culture, geography, etc.

""Academic freedom is an important social value treasured in Hong Kong and the cornerstone of our higher education sector. Since the implementation of the HKNSL, academics or post-secondary education institutions in Hong Kong continue to conduct normal exchange activities with their foreign or external counterparts. Meanwhile, post-secondary institutions in Hong Kong have taken a series of measures to incorporate national security education into students' learning in fulfilment of their statutory duty. These institutions enjoy autonomy on curriculum design, and the HKSAR Government encourages the institutions to provide students with diversified learning opportunities on national security education.""

Maintaining Long-term Prosperity and Stability 

The HKSAR Government spokesman stressed, ""Since the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, the HKSAR Government has been fully, faithfully and resolutely implementing the principles of 'one country, two systems', 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. Hong Kong has entered a new stage of advancing from stability to prosperity.

""Under 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong has the distinctive advantage of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world. Hong Kong is a member in the World Trade Organization and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation in its own right. With the unparalleled connectivity to the Mainland and the rest of the world, Hong Kong will continue to play its unique role as ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"". The stable environment benefitted from the implementation of HKNSL has served Hong Kong well to produce strong and ever-growing trade performance with the world, including that the EU continues to be one of Hong Kong's top trading partners. In addition, according to the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report released by the Fraser Institute, Hong Kong is ranked the freest economy in the world, ranking first in ""freedom to trade internationally"" and ""regulation"". Also, in the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025, Hong Kong's overall ranking has moved up by two places from the previous year to become one of the world's top three most competitive economies, and it even tops the rankings in ""business legislation"" and ""tax policy"". Hong Kong will continue to leverage its strengths to enhance its role as international financial, maritime and trade centres, among others, whilst proactively integrating into the overall development of our nation, including the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, the high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative, etc.. The HKSAR Government will also continue to create strong impetus for growth at full steam and proactively compete for enterprises and talents to strengthen the city's competitiveness.""

The spokesman reiterated, ""Any attempt by foreign countries or external forces to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability by slandering the city will only expose their own weakness and faulty arguments and be doomed to fail. The HKSAR Government will continue to discharge its duty, in adherence to the principle of the rule of law, to steadfastly ensure the successful implementation of the principles of 'one country, two systems', 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy. It will continue to create strong impetus for growth at full steam, forge a better integration of a capable government and an efficient market, and proactively compete for enterprises and talent to strengthen the city's competitiveness. It will take the city's economic development to new heights, better serving Hong Kong citizens and fostering the city's development."""

Hong Kong enters its summer influenza season with another case of severe paediatric influenza A infection reported,2025-09-09 21:26,2025-09-09 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900855.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 9) announced a case of severe paediatric influenza A infection. The CHP also reminded members of the public that the local influenza activity has further increased over the past week, indicating that Hong Konghas entered the summer influenza season. Members of the public should maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times. Schools and parents should arrange for children to participate in the seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) programmes at the start of the new school year to receive free vaccination and prevent respiratory infections.

New case of severe paediatric influenza A infection
-------------------------------------------------------------

The case involves a 15-year-old boy who developed a fever, sore throat, coughing and vomiting yesterday (September 8). He attended a private hospital and was admitted to its paediatric intensive care unit. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen was positive for influenza A (H3) virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A complicated with septic shock. He was transferred to a general ward today and is in stable condition. So far, his household contacts are asymptomatic.

The CHP investigation revealed that the boy had received the 2024/25 seasonal influenza vaccine. Five other students in his class recently developed mild influenza-like symptoms between September 5 and 6. They sought medical treatment and none of them required hospitalisation. No outbreaks have been reported in other classes at the school so far. The CHP advised the school on the necessary infection control measures to be implemented and will continue to put the school under medical surveillance.

Since last Friday (September 5), five cases of severe paediatric influenza A infection have been recorded. This marked the first occurrence of severe paediatric cases since mid-April this year. Since January this year, the CHP has recorded a cumulative total of 16 cases of severe influenza virus infections in children. Ten of them were unvaccinated in the 2024/25 season.

Influenza activity continues to rise
-----------------------------------------
 
After cautiously monitoring influenza trends over the past two weeks, the CHP determined that Hong Kong has entered the summer influenza season. Summer influenza seasons do not occur every year. During the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic (between 2010 and 2019), Hong Kong experienced a summer influenza season in five years. The summer influenza seasons usually occurred between July and August, and lasted for six to 18 weeks. The CHP anticipated that the local influenza activity would remain at a relatively high level in the near term.

According to preliminary surveillance data, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for seasonal influenza viruses during the week of August 31 to September 6 was 6.94 per cent (provisional figure), higher than the 6.16 per cent recorded during the preceding week (August 24 to 30).

Regarding outbreaks influenza-like illness (ILI) in schools and residential care homes (RCHs), the CHP recorded 26 outbreaks during the week of August 31 to September 6, affecting a total of 259 individuals, nearly doubling from the 14 outbreaks (affecting 81 individuals) reported during the previous week (August 24 to 30). With the start of the new school term, there has been a significant increase in ILI outbreaks in schools. The number of outbreaks rose from four (affecting 25 people) in the week ending August 30 to 15 (affecting 202 people) in the week ending September 6. In the first three days of this week (September 7 to 9), 24 school outbreaks (affecting 276 people) were recorded, with four cases involving 20 to 98 people. The CHP staff have inspected these schools and advised the schools on necessary infection control measures. These included recommending that students wear masks on campus, appropriately opening windows to improve ventilation in individual activity rooms and classrooms, thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting the campus, and suspending inter-class and inter-grade activities. The CHP also advised teachers and students to check their temperature daily before returning to school. If they develop symptoms or fever, they should not go to school. The CHP will continue to put these schools and RCHs under medical surveillance.

Vaccination effectively prevents severe cases of seasonal influenza and its complications
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vaccination has been scientifically proven to be one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. It also reduces the risks of in-patient admission and mortality due to seasonal influenza. The Government has all along been encouraging the public to receive vaccination as early as possible, and providing free and subsidised seasonal influenza vaccines to eligible high-risk groups through various vaccination programmes. During the previous influenza season (2024/25), approximately 2.09 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccines were administered under various SIV Programmes, setting a new historical high. Severe influenza cases among adults and children decreased significantly by 20 per cent and 60 per cent respectively, compared to the influenza seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic. It is believed to be attributable to higher vaccination rates.

The DH announced yesterday (September 8) that the 2025/26 SIV Programmes would commence on September 25 to provide a free or subsidised SIV to eligible high-risk groups through various vaccination programmes. A number of new initiatives have been introduced to encourage and enable public participation, including further enhancing the SIV School Outreach Programme so that all schools may choose to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV nasal vaccines) and ""hybrid mode"", i.e. schools being allowed to choose both injectable inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) and LAIV for the same or different outreach vaccination activities. Approximately 2 300 schools (99 per cent) have joined the outreach programme. To safeguard students' health, the CHP will publish a list of schools not participating in the programme on its official website to remind parents to promptly arrange for children in those schools to receive vaccinations from family doctors.

To make vaccinations more accessible, the Government will open all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged 6 months to under 2 years. Moreover, the 25 District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission, and 74 general outpatient clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For a list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP's Vaccination Schemes page. Starting from 9am on September 22, parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccinations at designated MCHCs via the online booking system.

The CHP reminded high-risk persons to wear surgical masks when visiting public places. The general public should also wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly, and consider whether to go to work or school. For the latest information on seasonal influenza, members of the public can visit the CHP's seasonal influenza and COVID-19 & Flu Express webpages.

Cyber Security Exercise SWORDLIFTER held by Hong Kong Police Force in preparation for National Games (with photos),2025-09-09 20:33,2025-09-09 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900821.htm,"The Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) of the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) conducted the Cyber Security Seminar cum Tabletop Exercise, codenamed SWORDLIFTER, at the Police Headquarters today (September 9). The event aimed to enhance cyber resilience, incident reporting co-ordination and immediate response capabilities of relevant stakeholders in preparation for the 15th National Games (NG), the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities (NGD) and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NSOG).

Speaking at the seminar, Assistant Commissioner of Police (Crime), Ms Chung Wing-man, stated that the co-hosting of the 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao carries great significance. As one of the host cities, Hong Kong shoulders the responsibilities and has the capability to strengthen its cybersecurity defenses, ensuring that the Games can be carried out in a safe, orderly and secure manner.

The seminar focused on the cyber threats faced and deployment strategies adopted during major sporting events in the past. Industry leaders were invited to share local and overseas case studies and best practices. Topics covered prevention of phishing and counterfeit tickets websites, website security, system intrusion protection and social media account security, in order to enhance the cybersecurity awareness of stakeholders.

The tabletop exercise adopted an integrated scenario simulating pre-event situations where the organiser and relevant stakeholders received malicious and false information, their official websites or related pages were hijacked, and critical infrastructures faced cyberattacks, etc. During the exercise, participants conducted incident analysis, multi-agency reporting and recovery operations, with a view to better understanding the potential impacts of different cyberattacks and corresponding response processes.

Joined by more than 100 representatives from over 30 departments, units and organisations, including the National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong), venue operators, various government departments, transportation and public organisations, as well as relevant sports associations, the event concluded successfully and affirmed the importance of cross-sector collaboration.

HKPF will maintain close liaison with all stakeholders to ensure thorough preparations for the upcoming 15th NG and the smooth running of the events."

香港已進入夏季流感季節　再添一宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案,2025-09-09 20:15,2025-09-09 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900814.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月九日）公布一宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案。此外，中心提醒市民本地季節性流感的活躍程度過去一星期進一步上升，顯示香港已進入夏季流感季節。市民應時刻保持良好個人和環境衞生，學校和家長應在新學年盡早安排學童參與季節性流感疫苗接種計劃，免費接種流感疫苗，以預防感染呼吸道疾病。

最新兒童甲型流感嚴重個案
————————————

個案涉及一名15歲男童，他昨日（九月八日）開始出現發燒、喉嚨痛、咳嗽及嘔吐，到私家醫院求診，獲安排在該院的兒童深切治療部留醫。他的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感（H3）病毒呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發敗血性休克。他今日已轉往普通病房留醫，情況穩定。他的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵。

中心調查發現，男童曾接種二○二四／二五季度流感疫苗，他就讀的班別近日有另外五名學生在九月五日至六日期間出現輕微流感病徵，他們已求醫，全部無需入院。其他班別暫時未有出現爆發情況。中心已向校方建議需實施的感染控制措施，並會繼續對該校進行醫學監察。

自上周五（九月五日）起已錄得五宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案，是自今年四月中後再次錄得兒童嚴重個案。自今年一月起，中心累計接獲16宗兒童感染流感病毒的嚴重個案，當中10宗未有接種二○二四／二五季度的疫苗。

流感活躍程度持續上升
——————————

經審慎監察近兩周流感的趨勢後，中心判斷本地已進入夏季流感季節。夏季流感季節並非每年也出現，新冠疫情前的十年（二○一○年至二○一九年）期間，本地共有五年曾出現夏季流感季節，一般在七月至八月間出現，維持介乎六至18星期。中心預料本地流感活躍程度會在短期內維持在較高水平。

根據初步監測數據，在八月三十一日至九月六日的一周，呼吸道樣本中流感病毒檢測呈陽性的百分比為6.94（臨時數字），高於上一周（八月二十四日至三十日）的百分比為6.16。

學校或院舍的流感樣疾病爆發方面，中心在八月三十一日至九月六日的一周錄得 26 宗涉及學校或院舍的流感樣疾病爆發（共影響259人），比上一周（八月二十四日至三十日）的14宗（共影響81人）增加近一倍。隨着新學期開始，學校出現的流感樣疾病爆發個案顯著增加，由截至八月三十日的一周四宗爆發個案（共影響25人），上升至截至九月六日的一周15宗爆發個案（共影響202人）。本周首三天（九月七日至九日）已錄得24宗學校爆發個案（共影響276人），當中四宗個案涉及20至98人。中心已派員在該些學校視察，並向校方建議需實施的感染控制措施，包括建議學生在校內佩戴口罩、適當開啓窗戶以改善個別活動室及班房的通風情況、徹底清潔消毒校園，及停止進行跨班別和跨級別活動。中心亦建議師生每天返校前檢查體溫，如出現病徵或發燒，不應上學。中心會繼續對出現爆發個案的學校及院舍進行醫學監察。

疫苗有效預防季節性流感重症及其併發症
——————————————————

根據科學實證，接種疫苗是預防季節性流感重症及其併發症的最有效方法之一，亦可減低感染流感而導致入院留醫的機會和死亡的風險。政府一直鼓勵市民盡早接種流感疫苗，並透過各項疫苗注射計劃為合資格的高風險群組提供免費及資助季節性流感疫苗。上一年度（二○二四／二五年）衞生署的各項疫苗接種計劃共接種約209萬劑季節性流感疫苗，創下歷史新高。成人和兒童嚴重流感個案較新冠疫情前的流感季節分別顯著下跌兩成和六成，相信是歸功於疫苗接種率上升。

衞生署昨日（九月八日）公布二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃將於九月二十五日展開，為合資格的高風險群組透過各項疫苗注射計劃免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗。當中包括多項新措施鼓勵和便利市民接種，包括進一步優化季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃，讓所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗以及「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。目前已有約2 300間學校（99%）參與外展計劃。中心稍後會將不參與計劃的學校名單上載至中心網頁，以提醒有關學校的家長盡快自行安排子女到家庭醫生接種疫苗，守護學童健康。

為了讓市民更加方便接種疫苗，政府會繼續開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有6個月至2歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下的25個地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的74間普通科門診和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱衞生防護中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可由九月二十二日上午九時起透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。

中心提醒高危人士到公眾地方時，應佩戴外科口罩。市民乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，亦應考慮佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，並考慮應否上班或上學。有關最新的流感資訊，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"
