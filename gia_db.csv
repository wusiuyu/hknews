勞工及福利局局長為「賽馬會安寧頌：融和篇」計劃啟動禮暨研討會主禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-06-16 12:50,2025-06-16 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/16/P2025061600363.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局（勞福局）局長孫玉菡今日（六月十六日）上午為「賽馬會安寧頌：融和篇」 計劃啟動禮暨研討會主禮的致辭全文：

陳衍里醫生（香港賽馬會董事）、程偉權醫生（醫院管理局策略發展總監）、文鳴教授（香港大學社會科學學院院長）、各位嘉賓及各位社福界的好朋友：

我很高興到此跟大家一起見證「賽馬會安寧頌：融和篇」計劃啟動典禮，「賽馬會安寧頌」已是街知巷聞，經過十多個年頭，由起初社會只是略知一二，到現時被廣為接受，在這方面賽馬會的投入的心力和時間值得嘉獎，要很多謝賽馬會，「安寧頌」由我稱它為「一般篇」，也就是大家在座各位的一般情況，再邁向「融和篇」，是一個重要的里程碑 。

大家都知道香港正面對老齡化社會的挑戰，65歲以上人口約佔總人口23%， 80歲及以上長者人口有40萬，佔人口5%，再展望下去數目增長很快，10年後估計有70萬80歲以上的老人家。當然大家希望父母親人都可以長命百二歲，但人總有一死，80歲過後距離往另一個世界的時間近很多，如何令他們可以有尊嚴地度過生命的最後時光是大學問。這除了適用於一般人身上，也適用於殘疾、智障和精神復元人士，大家都會變老，亦正因為政府和整個社會對他們的照顧很到位，我去參觀院舍服務時，也見到他們越來越多可以延年益壽，年紀都很大。大家都有老去的一日，如何解決步向死亡的最後一步，安寧頌的概念同樣適用於他們，我認為「賽馬會安寧頌：融和篇」是完整了整個計劃，亦很期待這方面取得巨大成就。

當然政府也投入很多工夫，政府已於二○二四年向約200間殘疾人士院舍增加資源以增聘護理人員，亦由二○二四至二五年起三年內，逐步增加約500個展能中心延展照顧計劃及約800個職業康復延展計劃的服務名額，目的加強照顧在中心較年長或身體機能比較差的殘疾人士。不得不提的是大家都很熟悉的照顧者支援專線182 183，所有的照顧者，其實無論是照顧年老的、殘疾的照顧者，遇到困難和困擾的話可走出來，致電不限於傾訴，熱線亦提供轉介服務；在比較危急的狀況下，社工會到現場幫大家解決眼前的危機。曾經覺得不可克服的困難或認為已經走到牛角尖時，只要肯和別人傾談，其實是有轉圜餘地的。尤其是利用暫托服務，暫時將心愛的人讓專業人士替你照顧一下，讓自己放鬆下來，世界並沒有那麼黑暗，會多一線光明，希望我們在這方面能做得更加好。

我在此再次感謝各位朋友的參與，我很期待通過今次「賽馬會安寧頌：融和篇」的試行計劃累積經驗後，為將來整個香港如何處理老齡社會，怎樣幫助老人家，無論他們殘疾與否，亦可以走好最後一公里的路。香港是全國其中一個人口最老的城市，另一個人口比較老的城市是上海，做好生命晚期照顧方案的工作，不止在香港適用，對全國都有借鑑作用。我在此祝願計劃圓滿成功，多謝大家。"
