勞工處發言人今日（九月二十四日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

勞工處印備了安全指南及單張，提供有關電力工作的安全指引。這些安全刊物可在該處各分區辦事處免費索取，亦可從該處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/content2_8.htm）下載。

"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-09-24 02:45,2025-09-24 03:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092400082.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (September 24) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

SFST discusses with Slovenian Deputy Prime Minister early commencement of CDTA negotiations (with photos),2025-09-23 21:32,2025-09-23 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/23/P2025092300908.htm,"  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, started his visit to Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, on September 22 (Ljubljana time) and welcomed Slovenia’s recognition of the benefits that a Comprehensive Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement (CDTA) with Hong Kong would bring to both economies.

  On the invitation of the Slovenia's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Mr Klemen BoštjanÄiÄ, Mr Hui will join a high-level roundtable conference hosted by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) of Slovenia for financial ministers and financial experts. At a welcome dinner hosted by Mr BoštjanÄiÄ for panellists held on September 22, Mr Hui was greeted with the good news that the Slovenian Government and National Assembly are deliberating on the decision to prioritise the CDTA with Hong Kong.

  ""It is reassuring to receive the encouraging response from the Slovenian Government soon after my initial proposal to Mr BoštjanÄiÄ this June that both sides are attaching importance in reaching a CDTA so that our business communities would be able to reap the tremendous benefits as soon as possible. With a CDTA in place, the business communities and residents of the two places will better understand the potential tax liabilities from cross-border investments, and enjoy avoidance of double taxation. This will be conducive to creating a more favourable and attractive business environment for investors to establish or expand their businesses. With the commitment of both sides, the first round of CDTA negotiations should be possible in the near future,"" he said.

  Earlier in the day, Mr Hui met with the Chairman of the Capital Market Authority (CMA) of Saudi Arabia, Mr Mohammed bin Abdullah Elkuwaiz, to update him on the situation of Hong Kong's financial market and the various initiatives announced in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" to consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. The CMA is the regulator of the Saudi Arabian capital market, including the Saudi Stock Exchange, which is the only authorised entity allowed to carry out the trading of securities in Saudi Arabia.

  Mr Elkuwaiz has a great interest in Hong Kong's financial market and its various advantages. Mr Hui suggested enhanced co-operation between the two parties to help build the Saudi capital market into one of the most important financial markets in the world. He noted that the co-operation between the two financial markets is not new and Saudi Arabia can take the city as a reliable partner for investment and financial development. Collaboration between the two financial markets include the first Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) investing in the Saudi market listed in Hong Kong since 2023, two ETFs tracking Hong Kong stock indices on the Saudi Exchange since last year and the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding last year between the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia to work jointly towards anchoring an investment fund of a target size of US$1 billion as well as the first Islamic bond (sukuk) ETF listed in Hong Kong this May.

  Mr Hui also paid a courtesy call on the Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Slovenia, Mr Zhao Binghui. They discussed the latest trend and opportunities of Mainland enterprises going global, and how Hong Kong can play its unique role to better serve the relevant needs.

  On September 23 (Ljubljana time), Mr Hui will attend a high-level roundtable conference hosted by the MoF of the Republic of Solvenia as well as a business event organised by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia. He will also meet ministers of finance from other countries on the sidelines of the Slovenian MoF roundtable conference."

應斯洛文尼亞副總理兼財政部長Klemen Boštjančič邀請，許正宇參加由該國財政部主辦的財政部長及金融專家高級別圓桌會議。許正宇在九月二十二日出席Boštjančič副總理兼財政部長為講者而設的歡迎晚宴時，欣悉斯洛文尼亞政府和國會正討論優先處理與香港磋商全面性協定的事宜。

他說：「今年六月，我向Boštjančič副總理兼財政部長提出初步建議，希望兩地應將簽訂全面性協定磋商視為重點項目，以讓兩地商界早日把握由此帶來的巨大機遇。斯洛文尼亞政府能迅速給予積極回應，實在令人鼓舞。當全面性協定簽訂後，兩地商界及居民會更清楚地了解跨境投資的潛在稅務負擔，並受益於避免雙重課稅，這將有助於締造更有利和具吸引力的營商環境，助力投資者建立或擴展業務。在雙方承諾下，相信首輪磋商可在不久的將來開展。」

許正宇同日較早時間與沙特阿拉伯資本市場管理局主席Mohammed bin Abdullah Elkuwaiz會面，向他介紹香港的金融巿場最新情況，以及《行政長官2025年施政報告》內有關鞏固香港國際金融中心地位的多項措施。該資本市場管理局負責監管沙特阿拉伯資本市場，當中包括沙特阿拉伯證券交易所（沙特交易所）。沙特交易所是當地唯一獲授權進行證券交易的機構。

Mohammed bin Abdullah Elkuwaiz對香港的金融巿場和優勢相當感興趣。許正宇建議雙方加強合作，助力沙特阿拉伯打造其資本巿場成為全球最重要的金融巿場之一。他指出，兩地金融市場的合作由來已久，沙特阿拉伯可以視香港為進行投資及發展金融的可靠合作夥伴。兩地金融巿場至今已有多項合作，包括首隻投資沙特阿拉伯市場的交易所買賣基金（ETF）於二○二三年已在香港上市；兩隻追蹤香港股票指數的交易所買賣基金自去年起在沙特交易所上市；香港金融管理局與沙特阿拉伯公共投資基金去年簽署諒解備忘錄，共同籌備一隻目標規模達10億美元的投資基金；以及首隻伊斯蘭債券交易所買賣基金今年五月在港上巿。

許正宇也拜會了中國駐斯洛文尼亞大使館臨時代辦趙炳輝。雙方討論了內地企業「出海」的最新趨勢和機遇，以及香港如何發揮獨有功能角色，服務好相關需求。

九月二十三日（盧布爾雅那時間），許正宇將出席由斯洛文尼亞財政部主辦的高級別圓桌會議，以及由斯洛文尼亞工商協會舉辦的商貿活動。他出席斯洛文尼亞財政部圓桌會議期間會與其他國家財政部長會面。"

教資會秘書長訪問瑞典、法國及德國,2025-09-23 19:58,2025-09-23 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/23/P2025092300830.htm,"下稿代大學教育資助委員會發出：

大學教育資助委員會（教資會）秘書長鄧特抗教授於九月九日（哥德堡時間）至十九日（法蘭克福時間）率領代表團訪問瑞典、法國及德國，積極向國際推廣香港的專上教育，致力推動香港發展成為國際專上教育樞紐。

鄧特抗教授聯同由八所教資會資助大學組成的大學校長會國際化小組的代表團一行，出席在瑞典哥德堡舉行的歐洲教育者年會暨展覽。鄧特抗教授在年會暨展覽的專題研討會上發表演說，展示香港國際化和多元高等教育的優勢及各項發展機遇，歡迎來自世界各地的學者和學生到港追求理想。在教資會的資助下，大學校長會國際化小組亦設立香港館，以推廣「留學香港」品牌，支持招收海外學生來港升學的宣傳工作，並拓展國際合作網路。

鄧特抗教授在歐洲教育者年會暨展覽中的專題研討會上指出：「政府一直投放大量資源推動高等教育蓬勃發展，讓大學積極發揮培育人才及推動科研的重要角色，建立令香港引以為傲的國際聲譽。五所教資會資助大學躋身世界百強，六所名列亞洲五十強，四所位列全球最國際化大學首四強。香港的大學開辦的眾多課程均躋身世界一流行列。這反映香港在成為國際一流高等教育樞紐方面擁有穩固的基礎和獨特的優勢。香港亦將在二○二六年主辦亞太國際教育協會年會暨展覽。屆時，世界各地高等教育界領袖及代表將雲集香港，本港專上院校可藉此機會進一步提升與各地院校的合作交流。」

在香港主辦的晚宴招待會上，香港高等教育卓越教學聯盟的代表亦分享了高等教育界為應對即將來臨的挑戰推出的一些最新措施，這些措施充分展示香港教育界對卓越教學的承諾。

在外訪期間，鄧特抗教授與八所教資會資助大學的代表，於法國巴黎出席「法國—香港交流活動」，並與法國高等教育院校代表團會面。雙方就高等教育領域的最新發展深入交換意見，探討如何進一步鞏固並拓展法港的長期合作夥伴關係。

此外，鄧特抗教授亦分別在法國及德國與知名科研資助機構及學術機構的高層管理人員會面，就高等教育和科研領域的新興趨勢及合作機遇交換意見。他強調，香港高等教育界於科研方面的卓越成就備受國際肯定，在教資會的二○二○年研究評審工作結果中，香港約七成的研究成果達到國際卓越水平或以上。教資會轄下的研究資助局，透過多項資助計劃，以及與國內外研究資助機構合作，支持大型及尖端的科研項目工作。目前，香港與海內外逾70個國家及地區開展超過7 000項研究合作。這些成果彰顯了香港在推動科研發展堅定不移的決心。研究資助局亦會在二○二五年年底舉辦首屆「研究高峰會」，展示香港在研究方面的卓越表現，並促進研究人員之間的國際交流。

鄧特抗教授指出：「香港的優秀大學一直是歡迎世界各地頂尖學者和優秀學生的理想學術家園。作為國際專上教育樞紐及全球最具活力城市之一，香港誠意歡迎所有渴望實現學術夢想的人士前來，親身體驗香港可提供的學習和科研的機遇。」

二○二五年《施政報告》宣布各教資會資助大學授課課程的非本地生自費就學人數上限，自二○二六／二七學年起，將由現時相當於本地學生學額的百分之四十進一步提升至百分之五十。各大學可因應本身條件，循序漸進錄取更多非本地學生。此外，教資會資助研究院研究課程超額收生的上限，自二○二六／二七學年起亦將進一步放寬，由百分之一百增至百分之一百二十。這兩項措施將有助吸引更多優秀的人才來港深造及進行學術研究，進而打造香港成為國際高端人才集聚高地。"
"UGC Secretary-General visits Sweden, France and Germany",2025-09-23 19:58,2025-09-23 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/23/P2025092300835.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the University Grants Committee:

The Secretary-General of the University Grants Committee (UGC), Professor James Tang, led a delegation to visit Sweden, France and Germany from September 9 (Gothenburg time) to 19 (Frankfurt time) as part of efforts to promote Hong Kong's development into an international hub for post-secondary education.

Professor Tang, along with the delegation from all eight UGC-funded universities under the aegis of the Heads of Universities Committee's Standing Committee on Internationalisation (HUCOMSCI), attended the European Association for International Education (EAIE) Conference and Exhibition in Gothenburg, Sweden. During a dedicated session, Professor Tang presented the strengths and opportunities of Hong Kong's internationalised and diversified higher education environment that welcomes academics and students from around the world to pursue their aspirations in Hong Kong. With the funding support from the UGC, the HUCOMSCI also set up the Hong Kong Pavilion to promote the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand, support the publicity for recruiting overseas students to study in Hong Kong, and expand the international collaboration network.

Speaking at the session at the EAIE Conference and Exhibition, Professor Tang pointed out, ""The Government has been allocating abundant resources to propel the vibrant development of Hong Kong's higher education sector, supporting universities to step up their efforts in nurturing talent and advancing scientific research, garnering the international reputation that we take pride in. Five of the UGC-funded universities are ranked among the world's top 100, six within Asia's top 50 and four among the most international universities in the world. Many programmes offered by our universities are among the best worldwide. This reflects Hong Kong's solid foundation and unique strengths in becoming a premier international hub for post-secondary education. Meanwhile, the upcoming Asia-Pacific Association for International Education Conference and Exhibition in 2026, to be held in Hong Kong, will gather leaders and representatives from the higher education sector worldwide and offer local post-secondary institutions an opportunity to further enhance co-operation and exchanges with their counterparts around the world.""

At the Dinner Reception hosted by Hong Kong, the representative of the Hong Kong Teaching Excellence Alliance also shared some of the latest initiatives the Hong Kong higher education sector launched in the face of upcoming challenges, which showcased Hong Kong's education sector's commitment to teaching excellence.

During the duty visit, Professor Tang and representatives of the eight UGC-funded universities met with the delegation of French universities in Paris, France, at the France-Hong Kong Day. They exchanged views on the latest developments in the higher education sector and discussed how to deepen and consolidate the long-term France-Hong Kong collaboration.

Additionally, Professor Tang also engaged with senior management from prominent research funding and academic institutions in France and Germany to discuss emerging trends and collaboration opportunities in higher education and research. He highlighted that the remarkable research achievements of Hong Kong's higher education sector are well recognised worldwide, with some 70 per cent of Hong Kong's research outputs assessed as internationally excellent in the University Grants Committee's Research Assessment Exercise 2020. The Research Grants Council under the UGC supports large-scale research projects and cutting-edge work through various schemes and in collaboration with other research funding agencies both nationally and internationally. There are over 7 000 active research collaborations with more than 70 countries and regions on the Mainland and overseas. These achievements underscore Hong Kong's steadfast determination to advance research development. The first Research Summit organised by the Research Grants Council will take place at the end of 2025, showcasing Hong Kong's research excellence and facilitating international exchanges among researchers.

""Hong Kong's outstanding universities have been a welcoming academic home for top scholars and talented students from around the world. As an international hub for higher education, Hong Kong's doors are always open to all who want to realise their academic pursuits and experience the learning and research opportunities offered by one of the world's most dynamic cities,"" said Professor Tang.

As announced in the 2025 Policy Address, the enrolment ceiling for self-financing non-local students in taught programmes at UGC-funded universities will be further raised from the current level equivalent to 40 per cent of local student places to 50 per cent, effective from the 2026/27 academic year. Universities may progressively increase their intake of non-local students based on their individual circumstances. Moreover, the over-enrolment ceiling of UGC-funded research postgraduate programmes will be further increased from 100 per cent to 120 per cent starting from the 2026/27 academic year. These two initiatives will help attract more talented students to pursue their studies and research in Hong Kong, thereby building Hong Kong into an international hub for high-calibre talent."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-23 17:30,2025-09-23 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/23/P2025092300534.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 23), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 22 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 2 771 new CF cases in Guangdong in the past week (September 14 to 20), a significant increase compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 201 cases (September 7 to 13) and 178 cases (August 31 to September 6) respectively, in which 2 583 cases were recorded in Jiangmen. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of August, approximately 317 000 CF cases and 135 CF-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

 
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

ââ
  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

15th China-ASEAN Prosecutors-General Conference held in Hong Kong (with photos/video),2025-09-23 17:19,2025-09-23 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/23/P2025092300728.htm,"The 15th China-ASEAN Prosecutors-General Conference, hosted by the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People’s Republic of China and organised by the Department of Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), was held in Hong Kong today (September 23). The Conference was attended by around 80 participants including prosecutors general, attorneys general, and representatives from prosecution authorities from China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states.

Initiated by the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China in 2004, the China-ASEAN Prosecutors-General Conference is a regular multilateral platform for high-level exchanges between prosecution authorities of China and ASEAN member states on issues of common interest, with a view to enhancing capacities in combatting transnational crimes, protecting people's livelihoods and maintaining regional stability. The Conference is part of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and ASEAN.

The year's Conference theme, ""Combatting Money Laundering and Corruption, and Recovering Assets in the Technological Age"", highlights the transnational nature, fluidity and complexity of crimes relating to money laundering and corruption in the technological age and the challenges posed by technological advancements to effective law enforcement and prosecutions against money laundering and corruption, and calls for unity as China and ASEAN member states join hands to rise to such challenges in the digital era.

The Chief Grand Prosecutor and Prosecutor General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China, Mr Ying Yong; the Chief Executive of the HKSAR, Mr John Lee; the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, officiated and delivered their welcoming speeches at the opening ceremony.

In his speech at the ceremony, Mr Ying said that with the robust development of the China-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership, the strategic mutual trust between the two sides has continued to strengthen. The China-ASEAN Prosecutors-General Conference is an important conference under the China-ASEAN framework, and plays a vital role in promoting peace, security, prosperity, and sustainable development between China and ASEAN member states. The theme of this conference reflects the shared understanding among participants regarding the harms of money laundering, corruption, and cross-border transfer of illicit funds. It also embodies the common aspiration of prosecutorial authorities across jurisdictions to strengthen international anti-money laundering and anti-corruption co-operation, and to deepen collaboration in recovering criminal assets for better safeguarding regional security and stability while promoting common development.

Addressing the ceremony, Mr Lee thanked the Central Government for organising and supporting Hong Kong in hosting the conference. He said that China and ASEAN are good neighbours, good friends and good partners with a long history of co-operation. As the only bilingual common law jurisdiction under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong has full capability to uphold the rule of law and act as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution in the Asia-Pacific region. He said that countries should work together in the technological age to make use of innovative technology to combat the so-called innovators of crime, and build a future where technology serves safety. This conference is a good opportunity to strengthen co-operation between China and ASEAN countries in combatting cross-border criminal activities.

Mr Lam said in his speech that the HKSAR, under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, has close legal co-operation with ASEAN member states, including the signing of bilateral mutual legal assistance agreements, taking forward co-operation based on reciprocity undertakings and implementing key international conventions relating to combatting transnational crime. Hong Kong will continue to strengthen its collaboration with ASEAN member states in combatting transnational crime in response to the new developments in the region's economic and social landscape.

Following the opening ceremony, representatives from China and ASEAN member states proceeded to the plenary sessions. Addressing the plenary session of the Conference, Mr Lam proposed a multipronged approach to combatting money laundering and corruption in a technological age, including the strengthening of public education and imposing heavier penalties to deter members of the general public from laundering money for others; strict enforcement of legal duties to require financial institutions to detect and report suspicious transactions; using legal means to stop dissipation of funds in money laundering; and enhancing the prosecution's capability to handle technological crimes. Mr Lam briefed the participants on the latest legislative initiatives taken to improve Hong Kong’s legal frameworks in combatting money laundering and corruption related offences, as well as Hong Kong's active role in deepening collaboration with ASEAN member states in this respect.

During the conference, the Heads of Delegations of China and ASEAN member states will sign the Joint Declaration of the 15th China-ASEAN Prosecutors-General Conference, declaring and reaffirming the commitment of China and ASEAN member states to fight against transnational crimes, including money laundering and corruption; to strengthen co-operation and sharing of knowledge and best practices; to enhance anti-money laundering and anti-corruption regulatory frameworks and legal tools, and step up promotional works to enhance public understanding and awareness of money laundering and corruption.

During the conference held in Hong Kong, Mr Lam, as a member of the Delegation of China, attended bilateral meetings between the delegation and ASEAN member states to exchange views of common interest.

Your Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

  Hong Kong is one of the least corrupt places in the world. However, money laundering remains a serious issue because of other types of financial crimes such as deception. The proceeds of financial crimes, whatever they are, become the subject matter of money laundering. In 2024, there was a 2.3-fold increase in the number of persons prosecuted for the offence of money laundering compared with 2023, and 648 individuals were convicted of money laundering offences. We applied for court orders to restrain over HK$360 million of suspected serious crime proceeds under police investigation. Our anti-corruption agency, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, also applied to restrain over HK$400 million of suspected crime proceeds under investigation. By the end of 2024, around HK$2 billion remained restrained.

  To prevent and combat money laundering effectively would require the co-ordination and co-operation among the general public, the financial institutions, the law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies, the prosecution and also the judiciary. Further, while money laundering usually and traditionally involves funds in bank accounts, virtual assets are now being used for such purposes. I would like to highlight recent Hong Kong developments in four areas, which are relevant to ""Combatting Money Laundering and Corruption, and Recovering Assets in the Technological Age"".

Deterring members of general public from acting as money mules

  The use of ""mule accounts"" is common in money laundering. ""Mule accounts"" refer to accounts suspected of being sold or rented out for laundering crime proceeds, and money mule is someone who transfers illegal money on behalf of others. The purpose of using mule accounts is to make it more difficult to trace the funds, and to identify and prosecute the true criminals committing the underlying offences. We use two main ways to deter people from acting as money mules.

  First, public education. In April 2025, it was announced that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the banking industry will strengthen publicity and education efforts to disseminate messages to customers regarding ""Don't Lend/Sell Your Account"" including outreach activities to targeted segments, and enhance industry co-ordination through the formation of the Anti-fraud Education Taskforce by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) comprising 18 major banks. The purpose is to remind and warn people that they should not be tempted by quick money and lend or sell their bank accounts to anyone laundering money; otherwise, they run the risk of being convicted of money laundering offences.

  Second, heavier penalties. The HKPF would apply to the Court for enhanced sentencing, namely, to impose a more severe penalty, in money laundering cases in order to produce a stronger deterrent effect. By early April 2025, the sentences of 95 mule account holders had been increased by 13 per cent to 33 per cent, with sentences ranging from 21 to 75 months of imprisonment. In a very recent District Court case, HKSAR v Luo Jiayou [2025] HKDC 1334, decided on August 5, 2025, the money mule opened three bank accounts for his friend and received RMB4,000 as a reward; the total sum received by the three bank accounts was HK$9 million odd. The prosecution applied for an enhanced sentence pursuant to specific provisions in the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap.455). The Court held that: first, there is clear and cogent evidence that money laundering using bank accounts opened by ""ML Stooges"" is still widespread and commonly being practised in Hong Kong today; second, what true criminals need are gullible scapegoats like the defendant in that case who would take the blame for them when the law enforcement takes action; third, the court must send a clear message to the general public that people who play the role of ""ML Stooge"" will receive severe punishment, so that there is a deterrent effect; and when there are fewer or no willing ""ML Stooges"", the criminal activities which rely on their bank accounts would fail. At the end, the Judge increased the original sentence of 40 months by 25 per cent to 50 months.

Requiring and empowering bank and other institutions to detect and then report suspicious transactions

  Banks are on the frontline of global efforts against money laundering. This is necessarily so because the targeted funds pass through their hands and generally only banks are positioned to detect and scrutinise suspicious transactions. Only they have knowledge of their customers and their banking activities. Accordingly, our statutory and regulatory rules (for example, the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Cap. 615)) require banks to have in place a working system to conduct customer due diligence; to maintain continuous monitoring of customer accounts; to investigate suspicious transactions; to cease dealing with the account holders and to freeze the funds where suspicions are unresolved; and to report suspicions to the Police. There are four points I wish to make concerning our efforts to ensure compliance of these obligations on the part of the relevant institutions and to enhance their capabilities to do so.

(i) Strict enforcement of legal and regulatory duties

  In case of contravention of the relevant legal and regulatory obligations, apart from potential criminal liabilities, the bank in question may be subject to disciplinary actions resulting in reputational damage. As an example, on July 22, 2025, the HKMA announced that it had taken disciplinary actions against three banks under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance: the penalties included a reprimand; an order to conduct a look-back review of past transactions, and develop and implement a remedial plan to address the contraventions; and pecuniary penalties. But these are very exceptional cases because banks in Hong Kong take compliance issues seriously. In the first eight months of 2025, over 120 000 suspicious transactions were flagged by the financial sector and professionals.

(ii) Use of artificial intelligence

  On September 9, 2024, the HKMA issued a circular on the Use of Artificial Intelligence for Monitoring of Suspicious Activities. It is taking various initiatives to further support and accelerate the use of artificial intelligence in suspicious activity monitoring: to give two examples, first, sharing experience and success stories of AI by organising experience sharing forums with speakers from the industry and technology firms; and, second, providing targeted guidance and support by a dedicated team with an external consultant.

(iii) Enabling information sharing among banks

  One of the challenges of combatting money-laundering is the ""information gap"" exploited by criminals to rapidly move and conceal illicit funds through the banking system, because banks that detect illicit activities cannot alert other banks owing to contractual and common law confidentiality obligations and statutory data privacy requirements. Hence, in June 2023, the HKMA, the HKPF and the HKAB jointly launched the Financial Intelligence Evaluation Tool to allow rapid sharing of information on corporate accounts among 10 participating financial institutions. However, about 90 per cent of mule accounts involved in fraud-related money laundering activities are actually individual accounts, rather than corporate accounts.

  To plug this loophole, on June 4 this year, the Banking (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 was passed, and it will come into effect on a date later this year to be announced. The new law provides authorised financial institutions with a voluntary sharing mechanism to request or disclose information on the detection or prevention of crimes whether the account holders concerned are corporate or individual. More importantly, the law makes safe harbour provisions for institutions disclosing information under the voluntary mechanism or using information so disclosed by other institutions so that they will be immune from potential prosecution or civil liability for breach of confidence.

(iv) Extending legal and regulatory requirements to virtual assets

  A new licensing regime for Virtual Asset Trading Platforms (VATPs) took effect back on June 1, 2023, which included the coming into effect of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Ordinance 2022 (Cap. 615). One of the purposes of the statutory amendment was to apply customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements to virtual asset service providers. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), responsible for supervising the VATPS, has published the Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (For Licensed Corporations and SFC-licensed Virtual Asset Service Providers).

Stopping dissipation of funds in money laundering

  Upon detection of suspected money laundering, the important thing is to stop the funds or property in question from further dissipation as soon as practicable. This is essential in order to enable the victims to recover the assets upon the conclusion of the relevant legal proceedings. In Hong Kong, where a bank has identified suspected transactions, it is obliged to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (JFIU), which is operated primarily by the HKPF and the Customs and Excise Department. At the same time, the bank will freeze the account provisionally. The JFIU will decide within two working days whether the bank should receive consent to deal with the funds in question. If consent is given due to unsubstantiated suspicion, the JFIU will issue a Consent Letter to the bank which will enable it to deal lawfully with the funds.

  But if there are good reasons for suspicion requiring further investigation, the JFIU will issue a Letter of No Consent (LNC) to the bank, which generally will continue to freeze the account. The LNC is usually valid for six months. When the LNC is in force, the JFIU shall use its best endeavours to obtain a restraint order from the Court under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance or procure the victim to seek an injunction from the Court to formally freeze the funds in the bank. It is most significant that, on April 10, 2024, the Court of Final Appeal of HKSAR in Tam Sze Leung and others v Commissioner of Police [2024] HKCFA 8 confirmed that the scheme of issuing LNCs is lawful and constitutional and does not infringe the right to property and other rights protected by our Basic Law.

  It should be noted that LNCs have been issued not only against funds in bank accounts but also virtual assets. In a case decided back in 2021, Yan Yu Ying v Leung Wing Hei [2021] HKCFI 3160, the HKPF had issued LNC to virtual asset service providers to prevent the dissipation of 999 Bitcoins. In a more recent case HKSAR v. Tam Lai Yin [2025] HKCFI 2116, the Police seized or froze the tainted cryptocurrency with a cold wallet to prevent dissipation. 

  It is equally important to bear in mind that the victim may also apply for injunctions in civil actions to restrain the further dissipation of the relevant funds. This is particularly useful when, for whatever reasons, the Police is unable, or no longer able, to freeze the funds in question. In such event, the Police would usually inform the victim and advise him to take civil proceedings to safeguard his position. As an example, in a recent case decided on August 28, 2025, Shan Jau Chan and another v. Yuloong Trading Co Ltd and others [2025] HKCFI 3888, upon an application by the victim of a cyber-fraud, the Court granted an interim injunction to restrain dissipation of the funds in question when the Police indicated that they could no longer maintain the LNC upon legal advice.

  The Court has adopted various innovative measures, likely to be among the first in the world, in assisting victims when the property involved cryptocurrencies. As example, in a recent case decided in April 2025, BP SG Investment Holding Limited v. Chen Shanxian and others (HCA 533/2025), the fraudster transferred assets of the victim into non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets. Non-custodial wallets are anonymous, decentralised and non-regulated; and therefore, it is almost impossible to identify the persons behind such wallets who perpetrated the relevant fraudulent transactions. This also makes it difficult to conduct effective service of the court documents on the defendants, such as an injunction order, which is usually essential in civil proceedings. To resolve this practical difficulty, the Court permitted the injunction order to be served firstly, through a tokenised injunction order, secondly, through a messaging platform between virtual asset wallets, and thirdly, through airdropping a non-fungible token (commonly known as NFT) containing a hyperlink to the court order. Putting aside the technicalities involved, these methods of service effectively ""taint"" the relevant wallets in the sense that all subsequent transactions that follow the service can be traced to the blockchain and the existence of the injunction can be seen, effectively deterring others from transacting with these wallets. Furthermore, the Court ordered the transfer of the suspected fraud proceeds to a custodial wallet to be held in escrow by a cryptocurrency custodian pending the final outcome of the case. These arrangements ensured the effective preservation of virtual assets.

Enhancing prosecution's capability to handle technological crimes

  Enhancing our prosecutorial capability to deal with technological crimes is, of course, vital. To this end, in 2023, the Department of Justice set up the Technology Crime Sub-division under the Prosecutions Division. This division comprises counsel with specialised knowledge and built-up experience in prosecuting sophisticated and syndicated technology crime cases. Their duties also include providing legal advice to law enforcement agencies, active involvement in new legislation on cybersecurity and technology crimes, and exchange of knowledge and experience in combatting technology crimes with law enforcement agencies and other stakeholders.

  What I said above are merely examples and highlights, but I believe they serve as cogent evidence that Hong Kong will indeed spare no effort in preventing and combatting money laundering and corruption, and recovering assets in the technological age. We also look forward to strengthening our collaborations with other jurisdictions, including of course member states of ASEAN, in this respect. Thank you very much."

A 21-year-old male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Tokyo, Japan, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected methamphetamine in the check-in suitcase possessed by him. The man was subsequently arrested.

The arrested man has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (September 24).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

衞生防護中心呼籲市民在惡劣天氣下提高警覺預防類鼻疽感染,2025-09-23 15:03,2025-09-23 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/23/P2025092300653.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月二十三日）呼籲市民在惡劣天氣下提高警覺，保持個人及環境衞生，預防感染類鼻疽，並特別提醒高風險群組，包括長者及長期病患者，在颱風或暴雨後應避免接觸土壤或泥水，減低感染風險。

類鼻疽是一種由類鼻疽伯克氏菌引致的疾病。類鼻疽伯克氏菌廣泛存在於土壤和泥水中，特別是濕潤的黏土。人類可能通過接觸受污染的土壤和水源（尤其是經皮膚損傷／傷口）、吸入受污染的微塵／水滴和飲用受污染的水而受到感染。長期病患者及免疫力弱人士有較大機會受感染。

根據海外文獻和本地數據，在颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令類鼻疽病菌更容易散播，令感染個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。

因應近期本港受颱風以及連日暴雨影響，中心再次提醒市民，特別是高風險群組例如長期病患者，盡量避免接觸土壤或泥水，以免受類鼻疽病菌感染。

類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得人類感染類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。因應二○二二年深水埗出現的類鼻疽群組個案，中心及水務署已採取一系列的預防及監察措施，包括在全港所有配水庫的通風口加裝高效能空氣過濾網、加強食水的餘氯含量、持續監測配水庫及用戶水龍頭食水的餘氯含量，並加強健康教育和監測感染個案。至今包括於颱風及暴雨後所進行的監測結果未有出現異常情況，而食水水質監測的結果亦一直符合香港食水標準。

類鼻疽病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可以透過接觸患者的血液或體液而傳播。類鼻疽的病人可出現局部感染（例如皮膚膿腫）、肺炎、腦膜腦炎、敗血症或長期化膿性感染。視乎感染的部位，類鼻疽常見的病徵包括發燒、頭痛、局部痛楚或腫脹、潰瘍、胸痛、咳嗽、咳血及局部淋巴結腫大。中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。

中心再次提醒市民應採取以下措施預防感染：


避免接觸受污染的土壤；
進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿著適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴；
高風險人士如不能避免接觸受污染的水或土壤，應佩戴口罩和手套，並穿上水靴
接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

CHP appeals for heightened vigilance against melioidosis infection following adverse weather conditions,2025-09-23 15:02,2025-09-23 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/23/P2025092300652.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 23) appealed to members of the public for heightened vigilance against melioidosis infection following adverse weather conditions and urged them to maintain personal and environmental hygiene. The CHP also specifically reminded high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water after typhoons or storms with a view to lowering infection risk.

  Melioidosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Burkholderia pseudomallei is widespread in soil and muddy water, particularly common in moist clay soil. Humans can become infected through contact with contaminated soil and surface water (especially through skin abrasions/wounds), inhalation of contaminated dust/water droplets, and ingestion of contaminated water. Those with underlying diseases or immunosuppression have higher risks of contracting the disease.

According to overseas literature and local data, Burkholderia pseudomallei in the soil and muddy water may be exposed to the ground after typhoons or storms, and the bacteria spread more easily with strong winds and storms. As such, infection cases are more common after typhoons or storms.

In view of the recent disturbance caused by typhoons andconsecutive days of torrential rain, the CHP again reminded members of the public, in particular high-risk groups such as those with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water as far as practicable to prevent melioidosis infection.

Melioidosis is endemic in Hong Kong, and human infection cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded. In light of the cluster of melioidosis cases recorded in Sham Shui Po in 2022, the CHP and the Water Supplies Department have implemented a series of precautionary and monitoring measures, including the installation of high-efficiency particulate air filters at the ventilators of all fresh water service reservoirs in Hong Kong, enhancing residual chlorine levels in drinking water, continual monitoring of residual chlorine levels in fresh water service reservoirs and consumers' taps, as well as health education and surveillance of infection cases. No abnormalities were detected from all surveillance results so far, including those conducted after typhoons and heavy rain, while the drinking water quality monitoring results have consistently been in compliance with the Hong Kong Drinking Water Standards.

Person-to-person transmission andanimal-to-human transmission are rare but may occur through contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. Melioidosis may present with localised infection (such as cutaneous abscess), pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, sepsis, or chronic suppurative infection. Depending on the site of infection, common symptoms of melioidosis include fever, headache, localised pain or swelling, ulceration, chest pain, cough, haemoptysis, and swelling of regional lymph nodes. The CHP again appealed to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromised conditions, in order to receive appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment.

The CHP reminded members of the public to take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. usinggloves and wearing boots;
If exposure to contaminated water or soil is inevitable, high-risk individuals should wear a mask, gloves and boots;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover any cuts or grazes with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soilor gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.

中國—東盟成員國總檢察長會議由中華人民共和國最高人民檢察院於二○○四年發起成立，是中國與東盟各成員國檢察機關就共同關注議題開展高層級交流的常規多邊平台，旨在提升各國檢察機關打擊跨國犯罪、保障民生福祉和維護區域穩定的能力。該會議是中國與東盟全面戰略夥伴關係的重要組成部分。

本屆會議以「數字時代打擊洗錢、腐敗犯罪及資金追繳」為主題，深入探討當前洗錢與腐敗犯罪在數位時代所呈現的跨國性、流動性和複雜性特徵，重點關注科技進步對有效打擊該類罪行的執法與起訴工作帶來的挑戰，呼籲中國與東盟各成員國在數字時代攜手應對有關挑戰。

中國首席大檢察官、最高人民檢察院檢察長應勇、香港特區行政長官李家超、律政司司長林定國資深大律師擔任開幕典禮主禮嘉賓並致歡迎辭。

應勇檢察長在致辭時表示，中國—東盟全面戰略夥伴關係發展勢頭良好，雙方戰略互信持續增強。中國—東盟成員國總檢察長會議是中國—東盟框架下的重要會議，在促進中國與東盟各國的和平、安全、繁榮和可持續發展中發揮重要作用。本次會議的主題反映與會各方對洗錢犯罪、腐敗犯罪，以及非法資金跨境轉移危害的共同認識，體現了各國檢察機關加強反洗錢、反腐敗國際合作的共同願望，持續深化在犯罪資金追繳方面的合作，更好地攜手維護地區安全穩定，促進共同發展。

李家超在致辭中感謝中央舉辦並支持香港特區承辦此次會議。他表示，國家與東盟的合作關係源遠流長，是好鄰居、好朋友、好夥伴，而香港作為在「一國兩制」下唯一實行普通法的雙語司法管轄區，致力維護法治，具備充分條件成為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決服務中心。他指，在數位時代下，各地應攜手合作，利用創新科技對付手法層出不窮的罪犯，創造安全的未來，此次會議正好加強國家和東盟各國合作，打擊跨境犯罪活動。

林定國在致辭時表示，香港特區在「一國兩制」框架下與各東盟成員國一直保持緊密的法律合作，包括簽訂雙邊司法協助協定、開展基於互惠承諾的合作，以及履行與跨國犯罪相關的國際公約。香港會繼續加強與東盟成員國在打擊跨境犯罪方面的合作，以應對地區經濟和社會形勢的最新發展。

會議討論環節在開幕典禮後舉行，林定國在環節上發表演講，提出數字時代打擊洗錢與腐敗犯罪需多管齊下，包括加強公眾教育與加重刑罰以遏止公眾替他人洗錢；嚴格執行法律義務並要求金融機構識別和上報可疑交易；運用法律手段阻止犯罪資金繼續外流；以及提升檢控機關的科技犯罪辦案能力。他向與會各方介紹香港特區為完善反洗錢和反腐敗法律框架所採取的最新立法措施，並積極深化與東盟成員國在這一領域的合作。

中國與東盟成員國代表團團長在會議上共同簽署《第十五屆中國—東盟成員國總檢察長會議聯合聲明》，鄭重宣告並重申中國與東盟成員國將致力打擊跨國犯罪，包括洗錢及腐敗犯罪；加強知識經驗與最佳實踐的交流共用；推動完善反洗錢和反腐敗的法律框架與法律工具，同時加強公眾宣傳，提升公眾對洗錢和腐敗行為的了解和防範意識。

中國—東盟成員國總檢察長會議由中華人民共和國最高人民檢察院於二○○四年發起成立，是中國與東盟各成員國檢察機關就共同關注議題開展高層級交流的常規多邊平台，旨在提升各國檢察機關打擊跨國犯罪、保障民生福祉和維護區域穩定的能力。該會議是中國與東盟全面戰略夥伴關係的重要組成部分。

本屆會議以「數字時代打擊洗錢、腐敗犯罪及資金追繳」為主題，深入探討當前洗錢與腐敗犯罪在數位時代所呈現的跨國性、流動性和複雜性特徵，重點關注科技進步對有效打擊該類罪行的執法與起訴工作帶來的挑戰，呼籲中國與東盟各成員國在數字時代攜手應對有關挑戰。

中國首席大檢察官、最高人民檢察院檢察長應勇、香港特區行政長官李家超、律政司司長林定國資深大律師擔任開幕典禮主禮嘉賓並致歡迎辭。

應勇檢察長在致辭時表示，中國—東盟全面戰略夥伴關係發展勢頭良好，雙方戰略互信持續增強。中國—東盟成員國總檢察長會議是中國—東盟框架下的重要會議，在促進中國與東盟各國的和平、安全、繁榮和可持續發展中發揮重要作用。本次會議的主題反映與會各方對洗錢犯罪、腐敗犯罪，以及非法資金跨境轉移危害的共同認識，體現了各國檢察機關加強反洗錢、反腐敗國際合作的共同願望，持續深化在犯罪資金追繳方面的合作，更好地攜手維護地區安全穩定，促進共同發展。

李家超在致辭中感謝中央舉辦並支持香港特區承辦此次會議。他表示，國家與東盟的合作關係源遠流長，是好鄰居、好朋友、好夥伴，而香港作為在「一國兩制」下唯一實行普通法的雙語司法管轄區，致力維護法治，具備充分條件成為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決服務中心。他指，在數位時代下，各地應攜手合作，利用創新科技對付手法層出不窮的罪犯，創造安全的未來，此次會議正好加強國家和東盟各國合作，打擊跨境犯罪活動。

林定國在致辭時表示，香港特區在「一國兩制」框架下與各東盟成員國一直保持緊密的法律合作，包括簽訂雙邊司法協助協定、開展基於互惠承諾的合作，以及履行與跨國犯罪相關的國際公約。香港會繼續加強與東盟成員國在打擊跨境犯罪方面的合作，以應對地區經濟和社會形勢的最新發展。

會議討論環節在開幕典禮後舉行，林定國在環節上發表演講，提出數字時代打擊洗錢與腐敗犯罪需多管齊下，包括加強公眾教育與加重刑罰以遏止公眾替他人洗錢；嚴格執行法律義務並要求金融機構識別和上報可疑交易；運用法律手段阻止犯罪資金繼續外流；以及提升檢控機關的科技犯罪辦案能力。他向與會各方介紹香港特區為完善反洗錢和反腐敗法律框架所採取的最新立法措施，並積極深化與東盟成員國在這一領域的合作。

中國與東盟成員國代表團團長在會議上共同簽署《第十五屆中國—東盟成員國總檢察長會議聯合聲明》，鄭重宣告並重申中國與東盟成員國將致力打擊跨國犯罪，包括洗錢及腐敗犯罪；加強知識經驗與最佳實踐的交流共用；推動完善反洗錢和反腐敗的法律框架與法律工具，同時加強公眾宣傳，提升公眾對洗錢和腐敗行為的了解和防範意識。

LD urges employers and employees to make work arrangements in times of tropical cyclones and rainstorms,2025-09-23 12:20,2025-09-23 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/23/P2025092300365.htm,"  As Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 (T8) will soon be in force, the Labour Department (LD) today (September 23) reminded employers to make work arrangements for employees during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable).

  An LD spokesman said, ""In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements, apart from factors such as operational needs of establishments, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs. For example, employers may permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work.""

  If the Government makes an extreme conditions announcement, apart from those required by employers to report for duty at workplaces, employees are advised to stay in the place they are currently in or in safe places when extreme conditions are in force, instead of heading for work. Employees who have already reported for duty at workplaces could continue to work as usual in a safe manner. If the workplaces are in danger, employers should release staff from work early under feasible conditions and in a safe manner, or make available a safe place as temporary shelter for employees. If the working time ends while extreme conditions are still in force, employers can release employees from workplaces in a safe manner or provide a suitable area as temporary shelter for those still at workplaces.

  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should work out arrangements for their transportation, safety, meals, rest places and more. If public transport services are suspended or limited when there is a T8 signal or higher, or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.

  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣及極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應就他們的交通、安全、膳食、休息地點等作好安排。在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

The Honourable Prosecutor General Mr Ying Yong (Secretary of the Party Leadership Group and Prosecutor General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate), The Honourable Chief Executive Mr John Lee, attorneys general, prosecutors general, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good Morning. I wish to extend a warm welcome again to each and every one of you for joining us today at the opening ceremony of the 15th China-ASEAN Prosecutor-General Conference. We are indeed extremely honoured that the state parties to the China-ASEAN Prosecutor-General Conference agreed to hold this year's conference in Hong Kong. More importantly, I would like to thank the Central People's Government and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in particular, Prosecutor General Mr Ying Yong, for the trust and confidence in the Department of Justice of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) by giving us the chance to organise this importance Conference for the very first time.

 The China-ASEAN Prosecutor-General Conference is one of the highlights of multilateral procuratorial co-operation between the PRC and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). Its establishment was initiated by the Supreme People's Procuratorate back in 2004. The Conference has now been firmly incorporated into the overall framework of the China-ASEAN Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. It has become a regular multilateral platform for high-level co-operation between China and ASEAN to enhance capacities of procuratorial organs in combatting transnational crimes, protecting people's livelihoods and maintaining regional stability.

 Hong Kong, being a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China, together with Macao enjoying the same status, have been given the opportunity to take part in this international procuratorial co-operation mechanism. As the Secretary of Justice of Hong Kong, I attend the Conference in dual capacity: first, as a member of the Chinese delegation; and second, as the head of delegation of the HKSAR. This serves as a vivid example of Hong Kong's special status under the fundamental principle of ""one country, two systems"".

 Under this fundamental principle, Hong Kong applies the common law system with a judiciary having the independent power of adjudication including that of final adjudication. Hong Kong has also been authorised to take part in international affairs in different areas either as a member of the PRC or in the name of Hong Kong, China. Let me focus on legal co-operation between the HKSAR and ASEAN countries.

 At present, the HKSAR has operative bilateral mutual legal assistance agreements with Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore. For other ASEAN jurisdictions, the HKSAR may co-operate with them based on reciprocity undertakings and key international conventions relating to combatting transnational crimes such as the United Nations Convention Against Corruption and the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime. In the past year, the HKSAR has processed 85 mutual legal assistance requests received from ASEAN member jurisdictions and we have issued eight requests to our ASEAN counterparts. Those cases cover asset recovery requests relating to various offences including corruption and money laundering. In addition, the HKSAR has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Brunei, Cambodia and Thailand on general legal co-operation.

 Hong Kong's success as an international financial, trading and shipping centre depends very much on its strong rule of law, being one of the least corrupt places in the world and providing a secure environment whilst allowing free flow of capital and property. Hong Kong will spare no effort in strengthening our collaborations with ASEAN member states on addressing and combatting transnational crimes in response to the new developments in the region's economic and social landscape.

 At the plenary session which will begin soon, I will share with you relevant developments and experiences in Hong Kong concerning the theme of this year's Conference, namely, ""Combatting Money Laundering and Corruption, and Recovering Assets in the Technological Age"". I also look forward to hearing from Prosecutor-General Mr Ying Yong and the heads of delegation from ASEAN member states.

 As proven by the success which has been achieved in the past conferences, I am confident that by sharing knowledge and experiences in our respective jurisdictions, we will all be in a better position to address issues and overcome challenges relating to the theme of this Conference. More importantly, this Conference provides an excellent opportunity for leaders and representatives of the prosecutorial organs of all participating jurisdictions to establish and strengthen our friendship, and to consolidate our solidarity and determination to combat transnational crimes together.

 On this note, I wish you all a very pleasant stay in Hong Kong, and a very constructive and successful Conference. Thank you very much."

A series of ""Hong Kong Cinema @ Busan 2025"" exchange activities was organised and a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed with the Busan Asian Film School with a view to promoting Hong Kong films, fostering cultural exchanges and expanding overseas markets.

Sponsored by CCIDA and co-organised by the BIFF and the Asian Film Awards Academy, the ""Hong Kong Night"" networking reception was held on September 19 and attracted over 600 film industry representatives and filmmakers from around the world. Head (Film Promotion and Facilitation) of CCIDA, Ms Irene Yuen, said during the event that the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was committed to supporting the development of the Hong Kong's film industry, and had further deepened international exchanges and co-operation in recent years, supporting the film industry to participate in renowned film festivals worldwide, promoting exchanges and expanding business opportunities. She also extended her congratulations to filmmaker Sylvia Chang on receiving the Camellia Award, a special prize that celebrates her contributions to advancing women's roles in the Asian film industry.

Besides, the film ""Measure in Love"", funded by the Film Development Fund (FDF), held its world premiere at the BIFF on September 21 and attracted over 5 000 attendees with an overwhelming response. The film is the first production under the Directors' Succession Scheme of the FDF, which aims to encourage directors to groom young talents in the spirit of mentorship. Sylvia Chang, the producer of the film, expressed her special thanks to the Scheme for its support, as it enables experienced filmmakers to partner with new generation directors in producing films and to learn from each other. Other guests present at the premiere included emerging director Kung Siu-ping and lead actors Hsu Kuang-han and Angela Yuen.

CCIDA also took the opportunity to sign an MOU with the Busan Asian Film School which aimed at strengthening co-operation in activities and exchanges related to the cultivation of film talents. At the Asian Contents & Film Market, CCIDA collaborated with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council to support the establishment of the Hong Kong Pavilion, increasing overseas exposure for Hong Kong films and promoting more business collaborations. CCIDA also recommended and sponsored four Hong Kong producers – Johnny Wang, Terence Choi, Fanny Chong and Kinnie Cheung – to participate in the ""Producer Hub"", where they engaged in in-depth discussions and business liaison with international industry professionals to explore co-production and project development opportunities.

During the festival, CCIDA also held meetings with film organisations and representatives from film festivals around the world, including the Saudi Arabia Red Sea International Film Festival, the Indonesia Jogja-NETPAC Asian Film Festival, the Italy Udine Far East Film Festival and the International Film Festival Rotterdam of the Netherlands, etc, with an aim to forging international connections and opening up pathways for future co-operation.

As mentioned in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"", CCIDA will enhance publicity, exchanges, and business matching overseas and in the Mainland, and continue its close communication with the industry with a view to facilitating the development of the Hong Kong film market."

Honourable Prosecutor General Ying Yong (Secretary of the Party Leadership Group and Prosecutor General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate), Attorneys General, Prosecutors General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It gives me great pleasure to address you today, at the opening ceremony of the 15th China-ASEAN Prosecutors-General Conference. This 15th edition marks the first time the Conference is held in Hong Kong. And I'm delighted to welcome each and every one of you, to the world city of Hong Kong.

My thanks to the Central People's Government for organising the Conference, and for supporting Hong Kong in hosting it.

I am grateful to the high-profile officials, from ASEAN, the Mainland, Macao and Hong Kong, for participating in this year's Conference. And my thanks to you all for your invaluable contributions and support.

ASEAN and China, our country, enjoy cultural affinity, geographical proximity and closely entwined interests. We have a long history of co-operation, exchanges between us spanning thousands of years, from the maritime Silk Road to the Belt and Road Initiative.

The China-ASEAN Dialogue Relations was established in 1991. Five years later, China acquired full Dialogue Partner status with ASEAN. In 2003, the relationship was elevated with the establishment of a Strategic Partnership, which grew into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2021.

We are good neighbours, good friends and good partners. Underpinning our thriving friendship is a comprehensive, multi-faceted partnership, covering political-security co-operation, economic and trading relations, socio-cultural co-operation and much more.

These strong ties are visible here in Hong Kong, a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China. ASEAN, for 15 years in a row, has been Hong Kong's second-largest merchandise trading partner. ASEAN is Hong Kong's third-largest outward investment destination, and sixth-largest source of inward direct investment.

The China-ASEAN Prosecutors-General Conference is a key aspect of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.

Since its establishment in 2004, the Conference has enabled high-level discussions and exchanges among procuratorial organs and prosecutorial authorities of China and ASEAN member states on issues of common interest. These include transnational human trafficking, drug trafficking, arms trafficking and digital fraud.

As many of you would know, China, our country has hosted the Conference three times. And this is the first time Hong Kong has been given the privilege of organising this essential annual gathering. That we can do so is thanks to the unique principle of ""one country, two systems"", which has been faithfully implemented in Hong Kong since 1997.

Under the principle, Hong Kong maintains its common law system, which resembles the legal regime in most global financial hubs, and is the only common law jurisdiction within China, our country. As the only bilingual common law jurisdiction where Chinese and English are both used in legal proceedings, our legal system connects people of varying backgrounds and cultures.

No less important, our judiciary exercises its powers independently, vested with the power of final adjudication. Our Department of Justice, headed by Secretary Paul Lam, controls criminal prosecutions, free from any interference. Our vibrant financial market is supported by robust institutional frameworks, and aligns with international regulatory standards.

In short, Hong Kong has the full capability, and necessary conditions, to uphold and maintain the rule of law, to act as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.

And we are committed to achieving that with all of you. I am confident that Hong Kong, given its unparalleled position, can contribute to the great partnership between China and ASEAN.

This year's Conference theme, ""Combatting Money Laundering and Corruption, and Recovering Assets in the Technological Age"", highlights the great need to tackle two perennial evils: money laundering and corruption. It also brings into sharp focus the challenges posed by technology's continuing advancement, in the detection and effective prosecution of commercial crime.

Although technology has enabled crime to proliferate and transcend jurisdictional boundaries, the evil lies not in technology, but those who abuse it. Technology stimulates creativity and enhances the flow of information. When misused, however, new technologies make it easier for criminals to engage in unlawful activities.

The emergence of technological innovations such as cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence, and the prevalence of the Internet and social media, create a lot of merits and, at the same time, new and continuing challenges to law enforcement and prosecution.

Cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain transactions used to hide identities, and the use of AI technology in deceptions, make crimes harder to detect and guard against.

These and other challenges to the rule of law must be blunted, at both the domestic and international levels.

And, ladies and gentlemen, let me say it here that while technology may have become an emerging accelerant for crime, it must also be our strongest shield. We will not retreat from innovation – we will master it, harness it, and turn its power back against those who seek to disrupt our community.

Our goal is clear: we will out-innovate so-called innovators of crime, and build a future where technology serves safety, not chaos. And it is imperative we turn our respective strengths into collective strengths, helping one another tackle the continuing challenges.

As the saying goes, ""In union, there is strength"". Through this Conference, we will seek fresh breakthroughs, fostering collaborations that multiply rather than simply adding to our individual strengths.

I have every confidence that we will emerge more united and determined from this year's China-ASEAN Prosecutors-General Conference, better connected and equipped to combat cross-jurisdictional commercial crime.

Like combatting crime, united efforts are paramount to tackling dangers posed by extreme weather conditions. As I'm speaking, a super typhoon is fast approaching Hong Kong, and could pose significant threats to the community. The weather will rapidly deteriorate with heavy winds and thunderstorms.

We are no stranger to typhoons in this part of the globe. The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government has made advance preparations extensively and stepped up preventive measures, with more and all emergency response teams in full readiness, and with the primary goal of ensuring the safety of all people in Hong Kong.

Our Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre has already been activated yesterday (September 22), over 24 full hours earlier than usual, and is conducting real-time citywide monitoring, risk assessments and formulating response measures. As a precautionary measure, we have announced yesterday the suspension of classes in all our schools today and tomorrow.

We have also advanced the opening of temporary shelters across the territory, and they have been in full operation since an hour ago. While the typhoon is forecast to be hitting Hong Kong in the afternoon, this early opening of shelters in the morning will allow people ample time to make their preparations.

For our airport, for visitors coming from overseas, flight operations will significantly reduce from this evening, with a lot of flights cancelled tomorrow to ensure aviation safety for all. The airport terminal building will, however, maintain operation round the clock, supporting and caring for any passenger who needs help.

As part of our advance preparation against flooding, the Government has completed inspections and clearance work at some 240 locations prone to flooding, with 200 emergency drainage services teams and pumping robots all ready for deployment.

While the forces of nature may test our resolve, let there be no doubt: the HKSAR Government is going all out and making preparations all round, with widened safety margins and heightened readiness. We shall brave the storms with resilience, determination and unity.

For unity in combatting money laundry and corruption, the theme of today's Conference, Hong Kong believes in standing together, not in standing alone – in the belief that co-operation, collaboration and shared purpose are what see us through the fiercest of conditions. That spirit is what has brought us here today: a commitment to join hands, strengthen ties, and build a future that no storm can shake.

I would like to end by thanking again the Central Government for its support to Hong Kong in holding this remarkable Conference. I also wish to thank our Department of Justice, which has made extensive preparations for this event to ensure the best, and safest, of your experience here in Hong Kong.

I wish you all a rewarding Conference and an enjoyable stay in Hong Kong. Thank you."

Our goal is clear: we will out-innovate so-called innovators of crime, and build a future where technology serves safety, not chaos. And it is imperative we turn our respective strengths into collective strengths, helping one another tackle the continuing challenges.

As the saying goes, ""In union, there is strength"". Through this Conference, we will seek fresh breakthroughs, fostering collaborations that multiply rather than simply adding to our individual strengths.

I have every confidence that we will emerge more united and determined from this year's China-ASEAN Prosecutors-General Conference, better connected and equipped to combat cross-jurisdictional commercial crime.

Like combatting crime, united efforts are paramount to tackling dangers posed by extreme weather conditions. As I'm speaking, a super typhoon is fast approaching Hong Kong, and could pose significant threats to the community. The weather will rapidly deteriorate with heavy winds and thunderstorms.

We are no stranger to typhoons in this part of the globe. The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government has made advance preparations extensively and stepped up preventive measures, with more and all emergency response teams in full readiness, and with the primary goal of ensuring the safety of all people in Hong Kong.

Our Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre has already been activated yesterday (September 22), over 24 full hours earlier than usual, and is conducting real-time citywide monitoring, risk assessments and formulating response measures. As a precautionary measure, we have announced yesterday the suspension of classes in all our schools today and tomorrow.

We have also advanced the opening of temporary shelters across the territory, and they have been in full operation since an hour ago. While the typhoon is forecast to be hitting Hong Kong in the afternoon, this early opening of shelters in the morning will allow people ample time to make their preparations.

For our airport, for visitors coming from overseas, flight operations will significantly reduce from this evening, with a lot of flights cancelled tomorrow to ensure aviation safety for all. The airport terminal building will, however, maintain operation round the clock, supporting and caring for any passenger who needs help.

As part of our advance preparation against flooding, the Government has completed inspections and clearance work at some 240 locations prone to flooding, with 200 emergency drainage services teams and pumping robots all ready for deployment.

While the forces of nature may test our resolve, let there be no doubt: the HKSAR Government is going all out and making preparations all round, with widened safety margins and heightened readiness. We shall brave the storms with resilience, determination and unity.

For unity in combatting money laundry and corruption, the theme of today's Conference, Hong Kong believes in standing together, not in standing alone – in the belief that co-operation, collaboration and shared purpose are what see us through the fiercest of conditions. That spirit is what has brought us here today: a commitment to join hands, strengthen ties, and build a future that no storm can shake.

I would like to end by thanking again the Central Government for its support to Hong Kong in holding this remarkable Conference. I also wish to thank our Department of Justice, which has made extensive preparations for this event to ensure the best, and safest, of your experience here in Hong Kong.

I wish you all a rewarding Conference and an enjoyable stay in Hong Kong. Thank you."

九月份第五批涵蓋七個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及六個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年九月共五批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共49個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年八月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這49個監察區中，40個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有九區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

  Among the fifth batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering seven survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering six survey areas in September, all were below 10 per cent.

  The FEHD has so far released five batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in September 2025, covering 49 survey areas. Among these 49 survey areas, 40 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. August 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation had improved or maintained a low level. Nine other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

  Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


  Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

  Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."
