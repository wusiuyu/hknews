SDEV meets with construction industry on special inspections and regulatory review,2025-11-27 23:59,2025-11-28 00:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700986.htm,"The No. 5 alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po has caused multiple casualties and the relevant departments are conducting a comprehensive investigation. The Development Bureau (DEVB), together with the Buildings Department (BD), met with the construction industry today (November 27) to discuss the follow-up actions related to the sector.

Chaired by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, the meeting was attended by representatives from the Construction Industry Council, contractors' associations, subcontractors' associations, trade contractors' associations, and labour unions. Ms Linn explained the follow-up inspections by the relevant departments (Notes) and requested the industry to cooperate.

Ms Linn also noted that the BD will review the requirements, guidelines, and regulations concerning scaffolding and protective nets, and will listen to the views of the industry.

Ms Linn further said that although the tragedy is suspected to have been caused by non-compliance from some industry practitioners rather than the use of bamboo scaffolds, bamboo scaffolds are indeed less fire-resistant than metal scaffolds. While the use of bamboo scaffolds has a long history in Hong Kong and offers more flexibility in adapting to certain narrow streets and building environments compared to metal scaffolds, the Government considers it necessary to develop a roadmap to switch to metal scaffolds as soon as possible under suitable worksite conditions. This aims to reassure the public and to provide better safeguards for construction safety. Industry representatives expressed understanding and support, agreeing to formulate an action plan with a clear direction that is not ""one-size-fits-all"". The next step is to identify work scenarios most suitable for switching to metal scaffolds (for example, new building projects and maintenance works at existing buildings along wider streets), followed by setting an ambitious roadmap for projects fitting those scenarios to switch to metal scaffolds. In formulating the roadmap, three factors should be taken into account, namely, the capacity of bamboo scaffolders and specialist contractors during the transition; the need for a stable source and sufficient supply of metal scaffolds to ensure adequacy; and the arrangements for transportation and storage of metal scaffolds.

Ms Linn said that the Government will consider providing assistance to the industry in terms of training and other resources during the process. The DEVB will put forward a proposal as soon as possible, based on the aforementioned consensus, for further discussion with the industry.

Notes:

The BD and the Independent Checking Unit (ICU) of the Housing Bureau (HB) today launched a special operation, issuing circular letters to registered building professionals and contractors. They are required to review the records or test documents for materials, such as scaffolds protective nets, used in ongoing projects, regardless of whether the buildings are under construction or are existing ones under maintenance. The review should include an assessment of the condition of the materials and their compliance with the standards and requirements for fire retardant performance. A report must be submitted to the BD within seven days, after which the BD will conduct audit checks. Meanwhile, the Architectural Services Department (ArchSD) has required contractors of building projects under public works contracts to review and submit the above-mentioned information within seven days. The ArchSD will also conduct audit checks.
	
The BD and the ICU of the HB, with the latter responsible for Home Ownership Scheme courts, today launched a special operation targeting existing buildings undergoing major external wall maintenance, where scaffolds protective nets were erected. Inspections will be conducted in batches for all such projects to proactively check records or relevant test documents for materials such as scaffolding protective nets regarding their fire retardant performance. Samples will also be collected for testing.

Government undertakes comprehensive follow-up on Tai Po fire (with photos/video),2025-11-27 23:59,2025-11-28 00:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700980.htm,"âA Government spokesman said today (November 27) that, in view of the No. 5 alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po that has caused multiple casualties, the Chief Executive convened another cross-departmental meeting this morning to co-ordinate all policy bureaux and departments, actively advancing the response efforts in four key areas: extinguishing the fire and rescuing trapped residents, treating the injured, providing post-incident support, and conducting a comprehensive investigation.

  In terms of rescue efforts, among the eight buildings in Wang Fuk Court, the fires in seven affected blocks are largely under control. The Fire Services Department (FSD) is continuing its full effort to complete the search and rescue and firefighting operations on the remaining floors. During the fire, the FSD received 346 requests for assistance and has handled 296 of them.

  On medical support, the Primary Healthcare Commission co-ordinated professionals from the public and private medical sectors, including over 250 doctors and more than 250 other healthcare professionals from the private sector, to set up medical stations at all temporary shelters. The medical stations provide appropriate medical assistance for residents in need from 8am to 8pm daily, including basic medical assessments and referral services, treatment of mild injuries, drug prescriptions (including necessary medication refills based on one's medical history), and psychological support, with a view to assisting in managing non-emergency medical needs.

  As for post-incident support, the Chief Executive has instructed the Civil Service Bureau to activate the ""Government-wide Mobilisation"" mechanism to ensure sufficient manpower for all necessary follow-up actions. Meanwhile, all government-organised celebratory events will be cancelled or postponed, and officials will reduce attendance at non-essential public activities to focus on relief and recovery efforts. The Government will arrange memorial activities, including flying flags at half-mast at government buildings, holding memorial services and setting up condolence books to allow the public to express their sorrow and condolences. Further details will be announced later.

  To meet the short- and medium-term accommodation needs of affected residents, the Government has opened nine shelters, which are currently being used by over 500 residents. The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau has contacted youth hostels and hotels, which will provide around 1 000 units for affected residents to stay in immediately for one to two weeks. The Government is also co-ordinating resources for transitional housing and dedicated rehousing units from the Hong Kong Housing Society, with an estimated 1 800 units to be made available later to meet the accommodation needs of the affected residents.

  In addition, the Social Welfare Department (SWD) has mobilised social workers, clinical psychologists and support staff to provide ""one social worker per household"" assistance to affected residents, including emotional support, financial assistance, and residential care and occasional child care services. The SWD will maintain close liaison with relevant government departments to provide all necessary assistance to those affected.

  The Education Bureau (EDB) immediately contacted the school heads associations in Tai Po and schools near Wang Fuk Court to co-ordinate class suspension arrangements for the affected schools. It also deployed staff to the temporary shelters to provide emotional support for affected students. The EDB will maintain close communication with the school heads associations and schools in the district, and continue to provide them with necessary assistance and support services.

  Starting tonight, the Government will provide an emergency cash subsidy of HK$10,000 to each affected household to offer immediate relief. At the same time, the Government has established the ""Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po"", allocating HK$300 million as start-up capital to assist residents and support all relevant work. The fund began accepting donations from 7pm this evening. Its designated bank accounts at the Bank of China (Hong Kong) are: HKD donation account 012-875-2-190159-7 and foreign-currency donation account 012-875-2-190160-7, enabling contributions from all sectors of the community to support the victims.

  As for funeral arrangements for the deceased, if affected residents require cremation services or columbarium niches, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department will make special arrangements and provide full support.

  Regarding investigations, Police arrested two male directors and a male engineering consultant of a construction company in the small hours today. They are being detained for further enquiries. Police have also seized for further inspection materials at the scene that may not have met regulatory standards. Once the fire is extinguished and on-site safety is confirmed, Police will co-ordinate with the FSD to gather evidence and conduct a thorough investigation to ascertain the cause of the fire.

  Separately, the Buildings Department (BD) and the Independent Checking Unit of the Housing Bureau today issued a letter to all registered building professionals and registered contractors requiring them to review relevant records or test certificates relating to fire retardant properties of the protective nets and the like used in scaffolds for ongoing projects (buildings under construction or existing buildings under maintenance). They must submit a report to the BD within seven days, after which the BD will conduct audit checks. At the same time, the Architectural Services Department (ArchSD) has required contractors of building projects under public works contracts to review and submit the above-mentioned information within seven days. The ArchSD will also conduct audit checks.

  The BD also launched today a special operation to inspect in batches all existing buildings that are currently undergoing external wall renovations with scaffolding and protective nets. The BD will proactively check the records or test certificates relating to fire retardant properties of the protective nets and the like used in scaffolds, and collect samples for testing. Regarding sample testing, the Government is also appealing for assistance from the Mainland to enhance testing capacity.

  The registered contractor responsible for the maintenance works at Wang Fuk Court is currently involved in 11 other private residential building projects. The BD inspected the relevant sites today and will take any appropriate follow-up action.

  In addition, the Development Bureau (DEVB) today met with the industry to discuss the roadmap for advancing the replacement of bamboo scaffolding with metal scaffolding. At the meeting, the DEVB also requested the industry's co-operation with the above-mentioned inspection and audit checks. The BD will review the relevant requirements, guidelines and legislation regulating the erection of scaffolding (whether metal or bamboo) and associated protective nets, and will consider whether there is a need for strengthening or enhancement.

  As at 8pm today, the No. 5 alarm fire in Tai Po has resulted in 65 deaths and 77 injuries, including one fireman among the deceased. To better co-ordinate the follow-up actions, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has established three working groups, namely an inspection and regulatory working group led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, an emergency assistance and fundraising group led by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, and an emergency residential arrangement working group led by the Deputy Financial Secretary, and has been actively taking forward the relevant work."
Labour Department launches special enforcement operation targeting fire safety in construction sites,2025-11-27 22:58,2025-11-27 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700949.htm,"âThe Labour Department (LD)'s spokesman today (November 27) said that the department is highly concerned about the No. 5 alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court, Tai Po, yesterday (November 26). The LD is saddened that the fire has caused multiple casualties and expresses its deepest sympathies to the victims' families and the injured persons.

  The LD will launch a two-week territory-wide special enforcement operation tomorrow, targeting the fire protection facilities and fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding erected. This includes checking if protective screens (also known as scaffold nets) are in compliance with recognised standards for fire-retardant materials to ensure work safety. Meanwhile, the LD will also work with the Buildings Department to inspect buildings undergoing major external wall repairs with large-scale bamboo scaffolds erected so as to ensure that scaffold nets installed on the scaffolds comply with the requirements of relevant Code of Practice/Guidance Notes.

  If any violations of the legislation are detected during the inspection exercise, occupational safety officers of the LD will take rigorous enforcement actions, including issuing suspension notices and improvement notices, and taking out prosecutions without prior warning, in order to deter unsafe operations.

Due to the recent dry weather, the LD strongly urges and warns all contractors that they should take notice of the fire risk of the site, particularly the need to enhance the fire safety of the bamboo scaffold, to ensure relevant materials are in compliance with the fire safety standards and clear up the debris regularly; smoking at site areas is strictly prohibited. While conducting hot work processes (such as welding and flame-cutting which may produce sparks), the safety measures devised from relevant risk assessment should be strictly followed, and sufficient and effective firefighting equipment should be in place. Contractors should further step up fire safety management to prevent fire incidents, ensure the safety of construction sites and workers and avoid recurrence of yesterday's tragic fire in Tai Po .

The LD also appeals to employers to be considerate to employees who are unable to work as usual due to the impact of the Tai Po fire, and to provide flexible work arrangements wherever possible to help them through this difficult period. Employers and employees may call the dedicated hotline 2929 4054 in case of enquiries on employment-related matters."
發展局局長就特別巡查及制度檢視工作與業界會面,2025-11-27 22:25,2025-11-27 22:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700926.htm,"大埔宏福苑五級大火導致多人傷亡，相關部門正進行全面調查。發展局聯同屋宇署今日（十一月二十七日）與建造業界會面，商討與業界相關的跟進工作。

會議由發展局局長甯漢豪主持，與會者包括建造業議會、承建商商會、分包商商會、行業承造商會及工會代表。甯漢豪向他們闡述有關部門的跟進巡查工作（註），要求業界積極配合。

甯漢豪亦向他們表示，屋宇署會檢視棚架及相關保護網等裝置的要求、指引及法規，並聽取業界的意見。

另外，甯漢豪表示，雖然今次慘劇懷疑是業內有違規行為而造成，而並非純粹因為使用竹棚架，但竹棚的耐燃性始終不及金屬棚架，縱然使用竹棚架在香港有長久歷史，相對金屬棚架亦可較靈活配合某些狹窄街道及樓宇環境，為令社會安心及為建造業安全施工提供更好的保障，政府認為應該擬定路線圖，以便在合適工地環境下盡快改用金屬棚架。與會業界代表均對此方向表示理解及支持，同意製定「非一刀切」但方向清晰的行動綱領，包括下一步工作需要識別何種工作情景比較適合轉用金屬棚架（例如新建樓宇及位處街道比較寬闊的現樓維修），接着為符合該等情景的工程項目轉用金屬棚架訂定一個比較進取的路線圖，並在擬定路線圖時考慮以下三個要素：竹棚工人和竹棚專門承建商在轉型過程中的承受能力、金屬棚架的來源要有穩定供應，確保供應充裕、金屬棚架的運輸和儲存安排。

甯漢豪表示，政府在過程中會研究在培訓和其他資源方面向業界提供協助。發展局會根據上述共識盡快提出方案，並與業界進一步商討。

註：
（一）屋宇署及房屋局獨立審查組今天啓動特別行動，向註冊建築專業人士及承建商發出通告函件，要求他們就正進行中的工程，無論是興建新樓或是現樓維修，覆核棚架保護網等物料的紀錄或測試文件，包括狀況是否良好，是否符合阻燃性能的標準和要求，並且在七日內向部門提交報告。部門會抽查個案以抽取樣本進行測試。工務工程中的樓宇項目，建築署要求承建商在七天內覆核並提交上述相關資料，建築署亦會抽取樣本進行測試。

（二）就正進行外牆大維修而有搭建棚架保護網的現存樓宇，屋宇署及房屋局獨立審查組（後者負責居屋屋苑）今日已啓動特別行動，分批巡查全部項目，主動檢查棚架保護網等物料的阻燃性能的紀錄或相關測試文件，並會抽取樣本進行測試。"

記者：特首你好。希望這場火能盡快撲熄，但我們要面對這件事。今日勞工處最新回覆傳媒，確認其實去年已收到宏福苑居民投訴有關棚網的防火問題，最近一次是在十一月二十日做過一次巡查，也只發出書面提醒。經歷了那麼長時間，有居民發現到問題，但是為甚麼不執法、不即時處理呢？居民也很想問，這次是否一宗人禍？會否有官員或公務員需要問責下台？謝謝。

行政長官：我成立三個工作組，其中一個工作組就是針對調查和規管的工作。我亦委派了政務司司長去督導所有的工作。我們有兩方面要主力聚焦。第一，這事件發生了，有哪些行為需要負責。警務處的調查已經由刑事方向展開。另外，在規管制度方面，我們怎樣可以更加強化，有沒有法例需要修訂；整個規管系統，怎樣可以確保將來這些不幸事件不再發生，這些就是工作組會全面推行的。我亦會審視所有過去有關這方面所提出的一些要求和問題。每一項都由這個工作組全面去跟進。但是，我們在這方面要實事求是，以科學為本，特別是我們針對不同物料的要求。一般來說，我們的要求都是符合國際標準的，但是有哪些地方可以強化，而且我們有監管制度、巡查制度、審批制度、驗證制度等等，工作組就要循這方向進行工作。

記者：剛才特首未有提到關於選舉的安排，現在會否延期？根據立法會的條例，最多只能延長十四日。會否延期多過十四日，或好像二○二○年般動用緊急法呢？

行政長官：有關選舉工程，我們已經暫停了。我今早在醫院向大家說，首要的任務就是要做好今次我們的應急和救援工作。我們會在第一階段的統籌工作完成後，全面審視整個情況，決定選舉是繼續怎樣進行。

記者：你好。請問港澳辦工作小組赴港協助開展救助工作，請問含義為何？會負責甚麼角色？會否反映特區政府在工作上有些不足？謝謝。

行政長官：第一，習近平主席高度關心這件事，我非常多謝習主席。我們國家「一方有難、八方支援」這精神，我相信無論在國內或香港，都是全面體會。過去發生了這場大火後，見到香港市民亦是「一方有難、八方支援」，大家都想多做一點，盡量將我們的傷痛時間縮短，將我們的傷亡情況減低，將我們的痛苦盡快撫平，我想大家都是本着這個心。

在習主席的高度重視和關心下，不同單位都很熱烈地支持香港特區的救援工作。中央港澳辦派了工作組來支援香港的救援工作，正正就是出於大家希望盡快將我們的救援工作完成。社會共渡時艱，化悲痛為建設香港的力量，我們是希望盡快復原。

亦因為這樣，我們一向以來建立了大灣區應急行動機制。這次不同鄰近城市的領導，自從發生火災後，都發了很多訊息，表示支持，亦表示任何我們需要的援助，他們都會提供。我們亦多謝不同的內地無論是省、市等單位，表示了他們在這方面的關心和支持。

我們一向在大灣區應急行動機制裏，有一些儀器、工具或化驗的協作，所以我們覺得這次是很好的資源讓我們可以運用。我們亦都制訂了一份清單，而這清單我們都覺得是實事求是。雖然就算沒有這些工具或資源，我們都會做好這件事，但我覺得將其效率和時間，盡量加速加快，確保能夠盡快共渡時艱，這亦展現了我們的積極性，以及盡快為大家撫平傷痛。本着大愛精神、本着大家有艱難的時候一起施以援手，我覺得這是我們很偉大的關愛精神的展現。

記者：想問因為屋宇署有關阻燃保護網的指引其實一直都存在，剛剛特首說會即時進行一個全港的巡查。其實過去屋宇署有否做定期的巡查？例如今次宏福苑那麼大型的工程，有沒有事前去巡查過？還是沒事發生就不會巡查？這次算不算後知後覺？有關剛剛調查的問題，會否包括政府部門的人員？例如剛剛有記者提到，曾經接獲投訴的勞工處相關的負責人會否都是調查的對象？

行政長官：我們在工程方面，無論是地盤安全、用料安全、管理安全方面，都有一個系統和機制，亦有不同的措施去規管和強化。香港工程數量很多，所以在不同方面會用多元化的的規管方法。有些我們要求專業人士履行其專業責任，對於某些工作，他去承擔責任，負起規則訂立、標準訂立和實際操作的一些要求。他作為一個專業人員負這個責任，我們在一些管理方面的機制，會發揮專業人士的作用。我當然期望，也要求專業人士履行好我們給予其重要的社會責任。但是如果履行不佳，我們當然要追究責任，也有巡查機制，按着不同方面的一些工程作出巡查，但是涉及的環節那麼多，我們在整體的監管機制裏要如何強化？當然，現在就是成立工作小組，它需要系統化地審視多種工程涉及的不同工業安全元素，我們都是系統化地進行研究工作及跟進工作。這些肯定會納入工作小組。過去巡查的工作不斷進行，但是哪些環節要增加、哪些環節要強化、哪些抽查要再增加資源？這些工作小組都會一一研究。多謝大家。

記者：特首，想問每次都是最後才多謝消防，是否不重視他們的付出？

行政長官：我想講清楚，我是非常感謝所有參與這次救援工作的人士、所有官員。當然消防處的同事是不眠不休，全力以赴，大家都看到，我與處長亦有不斷接觸和溝通，很明確表示可以動用所有資源給予消防處的工作，配合他們盡快完成任務。我今日到現場考察時，亦衷心感謝所有人士，包括消防同事和現場參與工作的人士。公務員在現時不同崗位正參與不同的工作，每一位都是全心盡力，在如此艱難的時候，大家同心做好這件事，令我們可以盡快過渡這個艱難時期。我亦多次感謝社會人士，無論是義工或供應物資，或將他們所知道的一些困難個案，轉告有關部門。

在一個這麼艱難的時候，當然有問題提出，我們亦要認真解決，因此我成立工作組，系統性處理因時間關係可能已經累積的問題，我們更要強化。在這方面，三個工作組任重道遠，我亦希望大家共同團結一致，將我們的悲痛轉化為建設的力量，大家令社會可以正常運作、令社會可以早日復原。多謝大家。"

記者：特首你好。希望這場火能盡快撲熄，但我們要面對這件事。今日勞工處最新回覆傳媒，確認其實去年已收到宏福苑居民投訴有關棚網的防火問題，最近一次是在十一月二十日做過一次巡查，也只發出書面提醒。經歷了那麼長時間，有居民發現到問題，但是為甚麼不執法、不即時處理呢？居民也很想問，這次是否一宗人禍？會否有官員或公務員需要問責下台？謝謝。

行政長官：我成立三個工作組，其中一個工作組就是針對調查和規管的工作。我亦委派了政務司司長去督導所有的工作。我們有兩方面要主力聚焦。第一，這事件發生了，有哪些行為需要負責。警務處的調查已經由刑事方向展開。另外，在規管制度方面，我們怎樣可以更加強化，有沒有法例需要修訂；整個規管系統，怎樣可以確保將來這些不幸事件不再發生，這些就是工作組會全面推行的。我亦會審視所有過去有關這方面所提出的一些要求和問題。每一項都由這個工作組全面去跟進。但是，我們在這方面要實事求是，以科學為本，特別是我們針對不同物料的要求。一般來說，我們的要求都是符合國際標準的，但是有哪些地方可以強化，而且我們有監管制度、巡查制度、審批制度、驗證制度等等，工作組就要循這方向進行工作。

記者：剛才特首未有提到關於選舉的安排，現在會否延期？根據立法會的條例，最多只能延長十四日。會否延期多過十四日，或好像二○二○年般動用緊急法呢？

行政長官：有關選舉工程，我們已經暫停了。我今早在醫院向大家說，首要的任務就是要做好今次我們的應急和救援工作。我們會在第一階段的統籌工作完成後，全面審視整個情況，決定選舉是繼續怎樣進行。

行政長官就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒開場發言（二）（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-11-27 21:02,2025-11-27 22:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700791.htm,"行政長官李家超今日（十一月二十七日）聯同政務司司長陳國基、政務司副司長卓永興、財政司副司長黃偉綸、保安局局長鄧炳強、民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟、勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡和消防處處長楊恩健，就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是他們的開場發言：

政務司司長：謝謝行政長官。

按行政長官指示，我會主持一個調查及規管工作組，處理火災後的調查及規管巡查工作。我們一方面透過全面調查，包括警方的刑事調查，以及房屋局獨立審查組就建築物外牆保護材料是否符合認可阻燃標準進行調查，徹底查出火警起因，並且依法、依規追究責任。調查結果會按階段公布。

另一方面，我們透過巡查、規管工作，盡快排除隱患，確保全港所有正在進行大型維修的屋苑的棚架及建築物料安全，亦可以令現在居住於這些屋苑的居民，以及他們的家人安心。

我現在會向各位簡介相關工作。

在調查工作方面，警方已經以涉嫌誤殺罪拘捕三名男子，並大規模搜查三名被捕人的住所及公司，檢走大量與案件有關的證據，包括招標文件、僱員名單，以及14台電腦和三人的手機作進一步調查。警方亦於火警現場檢走懷疑不合標準的發泡膠板等證物作進一步檢驗。

當火警撲滅及現場環境安全後，警方將聯同消防人員進入現場搜證，並大規模檢視現場一帶的閉路電視以搜集證據。

在規管巡查方面，屋宇署及房屋局獨立審查組，以及建築署，今日已啓動特別行動，就正在進行中的工程，無論是興建新樓宇或是現樓維修，要求註冊建築專業人士及承建商，覆檢棚架保護網等物料的紀錄和測試文件，包括狀況是否良好，是否符合阻燃性能的標準和要求，一定要在七日內向部門提交報告。初步估計涉及數以百計的個案。部門會抽查個案，並抽取樣本進行測試。

就正進行外牆維修，而有棚架保護網的樓宇，屋宇署今日已啓動特別行動，分批巡查全部涉及私人樓宇的項目，主動檢查棚架保護網等物料的阻燃性能紀錄及相關測試文件，同樣會抽取樣本進行測試。

對於另外四個正在進行外牆維修的居屋屋苑，房屋局審查組亦已經在今日緊急分派多組專業人員隊伍，到現場視察外牆棚架並採樣測試，確保承辦商所採用的棚架保護網合乎相關規定。

在樣本測試方面，政府亦正尋求內地協助，以增加測試容量，加快進度。

負責宏福苑維修的註冊承建商，現時涉及另外11項私樓工程，屋宇署今日會巡查有關地盤，要求提交阻燃性能的測試文件，並抽樣進行測試，以及視察現場有否不恰當的作業情況，並作適當跟進行動。

發展局今日已經與業界會面，商討推進金屬棚架取代竹棚架的路線圖。雖然使用竹棚架在香港有長久歷史，相對金屬棚架亦可較靈活配合狹窄街道環境，好像比較方便一些，但竹棚架在耐燃方面始終不及金屬棚架。為安全起見，政府認為應該盡快在合適工地環境下全面改用金屬棚架，並為此與業界一起作好準備，多些討論和研究，包括培訓工人及協助轉型。局方亦在會面中要求業界配合上述的巡查和覆檢工作。

屋宇署亦會檢視搭建棚架，無論金屬棚或竹棚，及相關保護網的要求、指引及法例規管，考慮是否有需要加強或優化目前的規管。

另外，我們衷心感謝中央和鄰近大灣區城市的支持。特區政府已根據資源共享機制，尋求內地支援，以強化火警調查和火災的善後工作。

我們非常感謝廣東消防救援總隊及深圳市消防支隊，借用八架配備熱成像功能的勘察無人機及能提供長期供電的兩架無人機，這些裝備有效幫助消防處加強火災現場勘察和緊急調派的工作。

我們會進一步聯繫內地機關尋求提供可以幫助我們搬運證物的裝置，正如剛才行政長官提及，例如外骨架助力器，有助消防人員負重上樓梯；和機械化運輸帶等。我們亦會統籌醫衞局（醫務衞生局）所需的醫療物資，包括專門解毒劑和嚴重燒傷專用的醫療耗材，以及發展局在盡量增加樣本測試容量方面，希望內地提供我們所需的協助。

我的匯報到這裏為止。謝謝大家。

政務司副司長：以下我會講講緊急支援及募捐工作組的相關措施。

第一，社會福利署（社署）會採取「一戶一社工」的措施，安排每戶一名專業社工，全程照顧及跟進，為居民安排所需福利，並與其他部門及單位協調，陪伴住戶度過艱難時刻。社署社工其實從昨日起已一直在現場聯絡受影響住戶，如住戶有需要，亦可主動聯絡社署職員。

第二，火災後，居民大多身無長物，需要一些緊急的金錢去應急，支付必需的日常開支，以解燃眉之急。就此，政府會向每一個受影響住戶派發一萬元的應急錢，我們預備了現金今日優先發放給在各庇護中心暫住的宏福苑居民。各庇護中心和大埔民政諮詢服務中心亦會接受其他宏福苑居民的應急錢申請，盡快發放。此外，我們正想方設法為災民提供公共交通優惠，方便出行，事成便會盡快公布。

第三，如行政長官剛才所言，政府已成立「大埔宏福苑援助基金」，我們投入了三億元作為起動資金，協助居民及支持各項相關工作。支援基金在今晚七時起開始接受個人及機構的捐款，港元捐款是中銀香港戶口號碼是012-875-2-190159-7及其他貨幣捐款戶口號碼是012-875-2-190160-7。

在物資捐贈方面，目前我們已經收到很多捐贈，物資基本充足。如果我們仍要社會捐贈，我們會作出宣布。

第四，今次重大事故導致大量人命傷亡，如果災民在殯葬上對火化服務及骨灰龕位有要求，食物環境衞生署會加速處理、全力配合。

最後，行政長官已經指示公務員事務局啓動「全政府動員」機制。所有政策局及部門需要安排足夠人手，隨時為需要額外人手的行動提供支援。例如，當災場解封時，政府會動員公務員，協助重返家園的災民，進行清理、收拾等工作。

我的簡報完畢。

財政司副司長：政府明白受火災影響的居民，在應急住宿上，有非常迫切的需要，行政長官指示成立應急住宿安排工作組，由我擔任組長，成員包括民青局（民政及青年事務局）、房屋局、發展局及勞福局（勞工及福利局）等的局長。小組目前的工作主要有兩方面。

第一，社署社工會聯絡不同住戶，了解他們的情況和需要。作為一個即時的緩衝安排，透過民青局同事的努力，政府已經物色到接近1 000個單位，這些單位位於不同的青年宿舍或酒店之內，可以讓受影響居民留宿起碼一至兩個星期。社署社工會盡快安排相關居民入住。這些青年宿舍和酒店在香港不同地區，以青年宿舍來說，例如有位於深水埗的南昌匯、位於元朗的保良局李兆基青年綠洲、位於啟德的啟航1331等；而酒店方面就包括屯門黃金海岸酒店、香港富麗敦海洋公園酒店、沙田帝逸酒店、灣仔木棉花酒店、荃灣如心酒店等。我知道酒店數目正在增加中，大家都想幫手。詳情民青局稍後會提供進一步的訊息。

關於後續的過渡安排，主要以政府的過渡性房屋，以及房協（香港房屋協會）的專用安置屋邨單位為主，我們估計初步合共可提供接近1 800個單位。這些單位有水電，可供煮食，單位內亦有淋浴設施。這些單位亦位於香港不同地區，包括大埔、葵青、元朗、柴灣、黃大仙、深水埗等等。社署社工會聯絡受影響住戶，按個別的需要及情況，作適當的入住安排。詳情房屋局稍後會有公布。我的匯報到這裏為止。

行政長官：接下來我請勞福局局長和民青局局長，向大家講解一下他們在各自範疇推進的工作，我亦請了保安局局長和消防處處長來此，如果大家有關於這些方面的問題提出，他們都可以回答。我首先請勞福局局長。

勞工及福利局局長：各位，除了剛提到會安排「一戶一社工」去跟進外，我們在現場留意到有體弱的長者，以及殘疾人士，我們已按他們的需要和意願安排暫託。至於年輕人和小孩，我們亦利用了於大埔的資源為他們提供託管安排，確保他們得到良好照顧。在醫院方面，醫務社工亦會為家屬提供一切可行的支援。此外，整個社福界都已經聯合動起來，會動用社福界所有資源，為有需要的災民提供各式各樣的社福支持。

民政及青年事務局局長：我先簡介各方面的工作，首先是庇護中心，剛才行政長官提及現時仍有九個庇護中心開放，這些庇護中心會開放至居民的臨時問題可以得到解決為止。在庇護中心開放期間，18區的關愛隊會輪流當值協助居民，尤其剛才政務司副司長和行政長官也提及，很多市民在火警逃生時可能沒有帶錢，或甚麼也沒有帶，他們需要一些應急錢，所以政府會為每個受影響的宏福苑住戶提供一萬元應急錢，今晚稍後我們便可為現時已登記入住庇護中心的住戶，提供每戶一萬元現金。其他未登記入住庇護中心的住戶，可以在明日或今晚稍後時間到庇護中心登記，我們會盡快發放每戶一萬元的應急錢給大家，希望在大家徬徨時，能有點錢傍身幫忙。

剛才行政長官也提及，政府會成立「大埔宏福苑援助基金」，行政長官決定投放三億元作為起始基金。在過去這段日子，我們一直都收到很多商界或不同界別的朋友，表示他們想資助或捐助，我們得到中銀（香港）的幫忙，今天馬上開了一個戶口。剛才行政長官也提到戶口號碼，我再說一次：中銀（香港），戶口號碼是012-875-2-190159-7。今晚七時，很快就可以接受捐款，如果大家想支持我們，幫助居民，大家可以捐款到這戶口。

另外，現時在各個庇護中心，我們都很感謝大家，很熱心地捐出不同物資，現時的物資都已足夠應付。我們知道大家想繼續幫忙，現在也有一些科技界朋友，希望可以創立平台供大家登記，稍後如果我們透過這些科技界朋友設計到一個平台，便可以供大家登記，但在這段時間，我想庇護中心需要先處理大家早前捐出的物資，我們希望可以有序地去安排物資。

在過去一日，我們透過不同的私營機構和慈善團體物色到1 000個房間，包括青年宿舍和在啟德的青年驛站。我們知道在網上有很多朋友說要開放青年驛站，開放啟德，甚至表示要幫忙做義工。這些工作我們已經準備好，很多謝大家的幫忙和熱心，但正如剛才孫局長所說的，我們會有「一戶一社工」，透過社工協助這些住戶搬入臨時住宿，而長遠亦有社工跟進他們的住屋和其他的福利需要。

少數族裔關愛隊也到各個庇護中心，了解是否有少數族裔市民有需要，我們暫時還沒有看到。我們暫時有這些報告，在接下來的日子，民青局和民政署的團隊一定會緊守崗位，協助我們大埔宏福苑的居民，渡過這個艱難的時間，也希望所有市民能夠繼續支持和配合我們各方面的工作，多謝大家對受影響居民的關心和支持。"

屋宇署亦會檢視搭建棚架，無論金屬棚或竹棚，及相關保護網的要求、指引及法例規管，考慮是否有需要加強或優化目前的規管。

另外，我們衷心感謝中央和鄰近大灣區城市的支持。特區政府已根據資源共享機制，尋求內地支援，以強化火警調查和火災的善後工作。

我們非常感謝廣東消防救援總隊及深圳市消防支隊，借用八架配備熱成像功能的勘察無人機及能提供長期供電的兩架無人機，這些裝備有效幫助消防處加強火災現場勘察和緊急調派的工作。

我們會進一步聯繫內地機關尋求提供可以幫助我們搬運證物的裝置，正如剛才行政長官提及，例如外骨架助力器，有助消防人員負重上樓梯；和機械化運輸帶等。我們亦會統籌醫衞局（醫務衞生局）所需的醫療物資，包括專門解毒劑和嚴重燒傷專用的醫療耗材，以及發展局在盡量增加樣本測試容量方面，希望內地提供我們所需的協助。

第四，今次重大事故導致大量人命傷亡，如果災民在殯葬上對火化服務及骨灰龕位有要求，食物環境衞生署會加速處理、全力配合。

最後，行政長官已經指示公務員事務局啓動「全政府動員」機制。所有政策局及部門需要安排足夠人手，隨時為需要額外人手的行動提供支援。例如，當災場解封時，政府會動員公務員，協助重返家園的災民，進行清理、收拾等工作。

我的簡報完畢。

財政司副司長：政府明白受火災影響的居民，在應急住宿上，有非常迫切的需要，行政長官指示成立應急住宿安排工作組，由我擔任組長，成員包括民青局（民政及青年事務局）、房屋局、發展局及勞福局（勞工及福利局）等的局長。小組目前的工作主要有兩方面。

第一，社署社工會聯絡不同住戶，了解他們的情況和需要。作為一個即時的緩衝安排，透過民青局同事的努力，政府已經物色到接近1 000個單位，這些單位位於不同的青年宿舍或酒店之內，可以讓受影響居民留宿起碼一至兩個星期。社署社工會盡快安排相關居民入住。這些青年宿舍和酒店在香港不同地區，以青年宿舍來說，例如有位於深水埗的南昌匯、位於元朗的保良局李兆基青年綠洲、位於啟德的啟航1331等；而酒店方面就包括屯門黃金海岸酒店、香港富麗敦海洋公園酒店、沙田帝逸酒店、灣仔木棉花酒店、荃灣如心酒店等。我知道酒店數目正在增加中，大家都想幫手。，詳情民青局稍後會提供進一步的訊息。

關於後續的過渡安排，主要以政府的過渡性房屋，以及房協（香港房屋協會）的專用安置屋邨單位為主，我們估計初步合共可提供接近1 800個單位。這些單位有水電，可供煮食，單位內亦有淋浴設施。這些單位亦位於香港不同地區，包括大埔、葵青、元朗、柴灣、黃大仙、深水埗等等。社署社工會聯絡受影響住戶，按個別的需要及情況，作適當的入住安排。詳情房屋局稍後會有公布。我的匯報到這裏為止。

行政長官：接下來我請勞福局局長和民青局局長，向大家講解一下他們在各自範疇推進的工作，我亦請了保安局局長和消防處處長來此，如果大家有關於這些方面的問題提出，他們都可以回答。我首先請勞福局局長。

勞工及福利局局長：各位，除了剛提到會安排「一戶一社工」去跟進外，我們在現場留意到有體弱的長者，以及殘疾人士，我們已按他們的需要和意願安排暫託。至於年輕人和小孩，我們亦利用了於大埔的資源為他們提供託管安排，確保他們得到良好照顧。在醫院方面，醫務社工亦會為家屬提供一切可行的支援。此外，整個社福界都已經聯合動起來，會動用社福界所有資源，為有需要的災民提供各式各樣的社福支持。

民政及青年事務局局長：我先簡介各方面的工作，首先是庇護中心，剛才行政長官提及現時仍有九個庇護中心開放，這些庇護中心會開放至居民的臨時問題可以得到解決為止。在庇護中心開放期間，18區的關愛隊會輪流當值協助居民，尤其剛才政務司副司長和行政長官也提及，很多市民在火警逃生時可能沒有帶錢，或甚麼也沒有帶，他們需要一些應急錢，所以政府會為每個受影響的宏福苑住戶提供一萬元應急錢，今晚稍後我們便可為現時已登記入住庇護中心的住戶，提供每戶一萬元現金。其他未登記入住庇護中心的住戶，可以在明日或今晚稍後時間到庇護中心登記，我們會盡快發放每戶一萬元的應急錢給大家，希望在大家徬徨時，能有點錢傍身幫忙。

剛才行政長官也提及，政府會成立大埔宏福苑援助基金，行政長官決定投放三億元作為起始基金。在過去這段日子，我們一直都收到很多商界或不同界別的朋友，表示他們想資助或捐助，我們得到中銀（香港）的幫忙，今天馬上開了一個戶口。剛才行政長官也提到戶口號碼，我再說一次：中銀（香港），戶口號碼是012-875-2-190159-7。今晚七時，很快就可以接受捐款，如果大家想支持我們，幫助居民，大家可以捐款到這戶口。

另外，現時在各個庇護中心，我們都很感謝大家，很熱心地捐出不同物資，現時的物資都已足夠應付。我們知道大家想繼續幫忙，現在也有一些科技界朋友，希望可以創立平台供大家登記，稍後如果我們透過這些科技界朋友設計到一個平台，便可以供大家登記，但在這段時間，我想庇護中心需要先處理大家早前捐出的物資，我們希望可以有序地去安排物資。

在過去一日，我們透過不同的私營機構和慈善團體物色到1 000個房間，包括青年宿舍和在啟德的青年驛站。我們知道在網上有很多朋友說要開放青年驛站，開放啟德，甚至表示要幫忙做義工。這些工作我們已經準備好，很多謝大家的幫忙和熱心，但正如剛才孫局長所說的，我們會有「一戶一社工」，透過社工協助這些住戶搬入臨時住宿，而長遠亦有社工跟進他們的住屋和其他的福利需要。

少數族裔關愛隊也到各個庇護中心，了解是否有少數族裔市民有需要，我們暫時還沒有看到。我們暫時有這些報告，在接下來的日子，民青局和民政署的團隊一定會緊守崗位，協助我們大埔宏福苑的居民，渡過這個艱難的時間，也希望所有市民能夠繼續支持和配合我們各方面的工作，多謝大家對受影響居民的關心和支持。"

今日凌晨，我在威爾斯親王醫院會見傳媒時講述了政府正在四方面積極推動應對今次大火事件的工作，首先是滅火和救援被困的居民，第二是救治傷者，第三是支援善後，第四是全面調查。

今早，我召開了跨部門會議，統籌全體政策局和各部門全面跟進火災的應對工作，並聽取司局長匯報其範疇下所推進的工作和最新進展。接着的工作會聚焦在以下幾方面。

我下午到了火災現場，視察最新情況，亦聽取了消防處和現場人員的匯報。

首先，我說說滅火和救援方面的最新情況。到目前為止，大埔宏福苑全部七座大廈的火勢，基本上受控。到目前為止，大火已造成55人死亡。在火勢逐步受控的情況下，消防員已經成功拯救了55人。縱然現場環境複雜，無論如何消防員的拯救工作不會停頓，全力以赴。

有關受影響居民的應急住宿安排，到目前為止，我們已開放了9個庇護中心，目前有超過500名居民正使用。我們亦正統籌公私營力量，動用所有資源為居民提供所需的應急住宿支援，民政及青年事務局物色到接近1 000個單位作即時緩衝安排，這些單位位於不同的青年宿舍或酒店之內，可以讓受影響居民留宿起碼一至兩個星期。而後續安排則主要以政府的過渡性房屋，以及房協的專用安置屋邨為主，初步合共可提供約1 800個單位，照顧災民住宿的即時需要。

另外，政府已經動員社工、臨床心理學家、教育心理學家等支援人員，為受影響的居民、學生提供協助，包括情緒支援、經濟援助、院舍及幼兒暫託照顧等。

我們亦已安排「一戶一社工」，為各個受影響家庭及有需要人士提供適切支援。社會福利署會與各政府部門保持緊密聯繫，為受影響居民提供一切所需協助。

我們亦統籌了公私營醫療界別專業人員，包括來自私營界別的超過250位醫生和超過250位其他醫護專業人員，於所有臨時庇護中心設立醫療站。醫療站每日上午八時至晚上八時為有需要的居民提供適切醫療協助，包括基本醫療評估和轉介服務、處理輕微創傷，甚至是處方藥物，包括根據病歷提供所需的藥物補充，我們亦會提供心理支援，以協助處理非緊急醫療需求。

至於死難者的殮葬安排，食物環境衞生署會特事特辦，提供全面協助，按家屬意願，以專項形式加快處理，另外亦有機構已表示會提供免費殯葬服務。

在調查及規管工作方面，警務處、消防處所成立的專案小組已經全面展開工作。警方凌晨拘捕三名男子涉嫌誤殺，他們是負責屋苑大廈維修的工程公司負責人，目前仍被扣查。警方今早亦到現場搜證調查。政府化驗所全力配合調查工作。

政府亦已即時進行分批巡查全港正進行外牆大維修而有搭建棚架保護網的樓宇。發展局亦已經與業界會面，商討推進金屬棚架取代竹棚架的路線圖。

政府會開設一個專門網頁，發布有關這件事情的最新消息。

我再次感謝習近平主席對今次事件的高度重視，內地不同單位都表示很願意支持我們，我很感謝他們。特區政府已正在草擬一份物資和支援的清單，我們會通過中央港澳工作辦公室和我們的應急機制，希望內地單位提供協助。這些清單的內容包括甚麼？例如：勘察無人機，亦有可以幫助消防員爬上多層梯級的助力器，也有運輸輸送帶，如可以供應給我們將讓我們在多方面的工作可以更快捷。

在醫療方面，我們亦希望能提供例如是在醫療方面的解毒劑，以及處理燒傷的醫療耗材，我們亦希望能提供一些實驗室測試材料。這個清單我們在擬備中，我們會盡快向港澳辦和經過我們的應急機制希望可以盡快取得，以增加我們的救援工作。

我亦多謝中央港澳辦工作小組已經抵港協助我們開展救援工作，這亦表示中央對香港的關愛和國家「一方有難、八方支援」的精神。

我知道大家都對事件感到極度悲痛，我們正在經歷一場集體傷痛，在這個艱難時刻，我們更加需要堅強面對，共度時艱。

我希望社會各界將哀痛和關愛轉化為建設力量，我們共同維持社會正常運作，讓社會可以早日復原。因應今次事件，我宣布以下幾個安排。

第一，未來這段期間，所有政府主辦的慶祝活動將會取消或延期，而政府官員會減少出席非必要的公開活動，聚焦處理支援善後工作。我們亦將舉辦悼念活動，稍後會公布詳情。

第二，我們會成立「大埔宏福苑援助基金」，政府會投入三億元，為受影響居民提供援助。我亦知道很多熱心人士和機構想提供幫助，亦表示希望可以作出一些捐輸。我們已經設立了一個戶口，這個是在中銀香港的戶口，戶口號碼是012-875-2-190159-7，今晚七時開始接受大家透過戶口捐贈。我們會確保這個基金會用在大埔宏福苑的援助工作。為了即時幫助受影響居民，我們會在今晚即時向每戶災民派發一萬元應急補助金，以解燃眉之急。

第三，由於之後的支援工作有可能需要大量人手，政府已經啓動公務員動員機制，我們會通知所有部門人員隨時候命，提供支援。事實上，亦有很多公務員表示他們希望參與工作，尤其是當災場受控解封之後，災民重返家園，進行清理、收拾時，除了消防人員和警務人員提供需要的幫助外，我們會動員公務員陪同這些災民，提供協助。

第四，為全面確保我們的工作可以積極推展，我會成立三個工作組，第一個是調查及規管工作組，由政務司司長做組長；第二個是緊急支援及募捐工作組，由政務司副司長做組長，第三個是應急住宿安排工作組，由財政司副司長做組長。這三個工作組會按照我的要求，積極推展工作。稍後我會請他們向大家講述工作細節。

我在此希望再次向不眠不休投入救援工作的消防人員、警務人員、醫護人員和前線人員等致謝。有消防員不幸殉職，是我們重大損失，所以我們亦會全力支援因公殉職同事的家人，提供一切協助。我亦在此再次感謝很多熱心人士主動做不同的義務工作，甚至是提供很多物資，這個亦都反映了我們香港大愛無疆，「一方有難、八方支援」的守護精神。在此，我再次多謝大家。我首先請政務司司長向大家說說其工作組的工作。"

CFS urges public not to consume a kind of prepackaged pistachio paste suspected to be contaminated with aflatoxin,2025-11-27 20:15,2025-11-27 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700702.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (November 27) urged the public not to consume a kind of prepackaged pistachio paste due to possible contamination with aflatoxin. The trade should stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately if they possess it.

Product details are as follows:

Product name: Pure Pistachio Paste Deluxe 100%
Brand: Convivia
Place of origin: Italy
Net Weight: 200 grams
Best-before date: February 17, 2027
Retailer: UK Store by HKTVmall

  ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned sample from an online vendor for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that it contained aflatoxin at a level of 15 micrograms per kilogram,"" a spokesman for the CFS said.

Under the Harmful Substances in Food Regulation (Cap 132AF), the maximum concentration for aflatoxin in any other food is 10 micrograms per kilogram.

The CFS has informed the online vendor and retailer concerned of the unsatisfactory test result. The vendor concerned has stopped sales and removed the affected batch of the product from shelves. The retailer concerned has initiated a recall according to the CFS's instructions. Members of the public may call its hotline at 3145 6888 during office hours for enquiries about the recall.

The World Health Organization (WHO)'s International Agency for Research on Cancer classified naturally occurring aflatoxins as carcinogenic to humans, and the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives advised that intake of aflatoxins should be reduced to levels as low as reasonably possible although no health-based guidance value has been set. Aflatoxins can lead to liver cancer after long-term ingestion, and the risk for hepatitis B carriers is relatively high.

The spokesman urged members of the public who had bought the affected product to stop consuming it. To avoid excessive intake of mycotoxins, people should maintain a balanced and varied diet to minimise the risk from a small range of food items, and to avoid consuming food that looks mouldy or damaged.

The CFS has alerted the trade, continuing to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing."
食安中心呼籲市民不要食用一款可能受黃曲霉毒素污染的預先包裝開心果醬,2025-11-27 20:14,2025-11-27 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700704.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（十一月二十七日）呼籲市民不要食用一款預先包裝開心果醬，因為有關產品可能受黃曲霉毒素污染。業界如持有受影響批次產品，應立即停止使用或出售。

產品詳情如下：

產品名稱：Pure Pistachio Paste Deluxe 100%
品牌：Convivia
來源地：意大利
淨重量：200克
此日期前最佳：二○二七年二月十七日
零售商：英式超市 by HKTVmall

中心發言人說：「中心透過恆常食物監測計劃，從一間網上商店抽取上述樣本進行檢測。結果顯示樣本每公斤含十五微克黃曲霉毒素。」

根據《食物內有害物質規例》（第132AF章）的規定，任何其他食物黃曲霉毒素的可容許最高濃度為每公斤食物含十微克。

中心已知會涉事網上商店及零售商上述不合格化驗結果，並指令其將受影響批次產品停售及下架。有關零售商已按中心指示展開回收，市民可於辦公時間致電其熱線3145 6888，查詢上述產品的回收事宜。

天然存在的黃曲霉毒素已被世界衞生組織屬下的國際癌症研究機構確認對人類致癌。聯合國糧食及農業組織／世界衞生組織聯合食物添加劑專家委員會雖然沒有為其製訂健康參考值，但建議在合理的情況下，應將黃曲霉毒素的攝入量減到最少。長期攝入黃曲霉毒素可能會引致肝癌，對乙型肝炎帶菌者更會構成較大的風險。

發言人呼籲市民如曾購買受影響產品，應停止食用。為避免攝入過多霉菌毒素，市民應保持均衡及多元化的飲食，減低因偏食某幾種食物引致的風險，並避免食用發霉或受損的食物。

中心已知會業界、繼續跟進事件和採取適當行動。調查仍然繼續。"

CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another severe paediatric influenza infection case reported,2025-11-27 20:01,2025-11-27 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700739.htm,"âThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 27) recorded another severe paediatric influenza infection case. The CHP urged parents to arrange for their children to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves a 2-year-old girl with good past health. She developed a fever, vomiting and loose stool since November 25. She was brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of United Christian Hospital yesterday (November 26) and was admitted. Due to shock and deterioration of general condition, she was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit of the hospital, and is being arranged to transfer to Hong Kong Children's Hospital for further treatment. She is currently in critical condition. Her nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A (H3) virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with shock, encepathopathy and multi-organ failure.

The girl had not yet received the 2025/26 SIV and had no travel history during the incubation period. One of her household contacts developed mild respiratory symptoms recently, but did not require hospitalisation and has recovered.

Including the abovementioned case, there have been 22 severe influenza cases involving children so far this summer influenza season, including two fatal cases. The affected children aged 11 months to 17 years. A total of 13 cases have been recorded since the launch of this year's SIV Programmes, with only one having received this year's SIV four days prior to the onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, in other words, these severe influenza cases are not protected by the vaccine.

""According to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity has gradually declined since late October. However, it remains above the baseline thresholds. As the weather turns cooler, influenza activity may still fluctuate. Moreover, a winter influenza season may occur early next year. Therefore, I once again urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV to do so promptly. Compared to the winter influenza season earlier this year, there have been more severe paediatric influenza infection cases this season. Currently, among children aged below 18 years, the coverage rate of children aged 6 months to under 2 years is relatively low, at nearly 17 per cent only. Parents should not hesitate and should contact their family doctors as soon as possible to arrange for their children, as well as themselves and other family members, to receive the SIV,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

He also reminded members of the public that, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly.

Residents affected by the Tai Po fire, their family members, or other citizens requiring assistance can call the hotline for professional help. Healthcare professionals will provide psychological support to those seeking help and, when necessary, assist with referrals for further treatment,"" the spokesperson said.

The Major Incident Control Centre (MICC) of the HA has been operational since the outbreak of the fire, maintaining close communication with various government departments to coordinate patient admission across public hospitals. The HA has mobilised 15 public hospitals to receive and treat the injured, including Prince of Wales Hospital and Queen Mary Hospital which have burn units, as well as Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Kwong Wah Hospital and Tuen Mun Hospital which are equipped with burn treatment facilities, to provide appropriate treatment for patients. Additionally, as some victims have inhaled toxic gases, the Hyper-baric Oxygen Therapy Centre at Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital has enhanced its staffing to provide hyper-baric oxygen therapy for injured patients as needed.

""With the large number of casualties requiring medical care, the HA has been closely coordinating and monitoring the mobilisation of hospital beds and manpower across different hospitals, particularly beds of intensive care unit, to ensure adequate resources for appropriate treatment of the injured. The HA extends its gratitude to all healthcare staff on duty for their dedicated care of the injured, especially those who were off-duty or cancelled their leave to return to hospitals to assist in treating the casualties,"" the spokesperson said.

In addition to enhanced staffing at public hospitals to care for the injured, the Family Medicine clinics of the HA have also strengthened their services to support affected residents. Those with medical needs can directly visit Family Medicine clinics for assistance. The clinics will provide necessary services, including doctor consultations, treatments, and medication dispensing for patients without prior appointments. Healthcare staff will provide utmost support to affected residents through this difficult time.

Several HA staff members have been affected by the Tai Po fire, including one injured staff member, one has lost contact, and around 50 staff members who have been rendered homeless.

再錄得一宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-11-27 18:53,2025-11-27 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700694.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月二十七日）再接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案。中心呼籲家長盡快安排子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的兩歲女童。她於十一月二十五日出現發燒、嘔吐及糞便稀爛，昨日（十一月二十六日）被帶到基督教聯合醫院急症室求醫並入住該院，及後因休克及身體狀況轉差，轉到該院兒童深切治療部接受治療，現正獲安排轉到香港兒童醫院接受進一步治療，目前情況危殆。她的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型（H3）流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發休克、腦病變和多重器官衰竭。

女童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗，於潛伏期內不曾外遊。她的一名家居接觸者近日曾出現呼吸道病徵，病況輕微，無需住院及已康復。

計及上述個案，今個夏季流感季節至今已錄得22宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括兩宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎11個月至17歲。若單單計算在本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃展開後錄得的13宗個案，只有一人曾在發病前四天接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。然而接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，換言之，這些嚴重個案的兒童都未能受到疫苗保護。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然最新的監測數據顯示，流感活躍程度自十月下旬起逐漸下降，但仍高於基線水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除流感活躍程度仍可能會有反覆，加上明年初或會出現冬季流感季節，因此我再次呼籲所有年滿6個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動。對比今年初冬季流感季節，今季兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案較多。目前，18歲以下兒童中，6個月至2歲以下兒童的覆蓋率相對偏低，只有近17%，希望各位家長不要遲疑，請盡快聯絡自己家庭醫生為子女，以至自己和其他家人安排接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-27 18:45,2025-11-27 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700661.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月二十七日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得72宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

近期錄得的輸入個案中，有五名患者居於青衣。中心的流行病學調查顯示，他們在潛伏期及發病後在青衣北活動的範圍有重疊，主要包括青衣市中心一帶及青衣自然徑附近。中心已把個案活動的地點通知食物環境衞生署（食環署），進行控蚊滅蚊行動。中心亦正就病人樣本進行基因排序及分析，並對比其他本地及輸入個案，以確定他們之間是否有關聯。由於部分確診個案報稱，在青衣自然徑行山期間曾被蚊叮咬，中心認為青衣自然徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心呼籲自十一月一日起曾在青衣自然徑一帶行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，盡快求醫，並致電中心早前設立的查詢熱線（2125 2373），熱線每日由上午九時至下午八時運作。中心會為出現病徵人士進行評估，如有需要，會安排抽血化驗，而過去四天中心未有接獲有病徵人士致電查詢。中心的流行病學調查仍然繼續。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-27 18:45,2025-11-27 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700668.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 27), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 72 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

 Among the recently recorded imported cases, five reside in Tsing Yi. The CHP's epidemiological investigation revealed that their activities during the incubation and infectious periods overlapped in Tsing Yi North, primarily around Tsing Yi town centre and the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. The CHP has notified the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of the locations visited by the five patients for mosquito control operations. The CHP is also performing genomic sequencing and analysis on patient samples, comparing them with other local and imported cases to determine whether these cases are linked. As some confirmed cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considers the trails to be a higher-risk area. As a precautionary measure, the CHP urged individuals who have hiked in the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area since November 1 to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the CHP's enquiry hotline (2125 2373). The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. The CHP will assess symptomatic individuals and arrange blood tests if necessary. The CHP has not received any enquiries from symptomatic individuals over the past four days. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Frederick (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Professor Frederick Ma), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Ciao. Good morning.

Thank you for observing a moment of silence with us together, for the 55 lives lost in a tragic fire that took place in Hong Kong yesterday. Our hearts and thoughts are with all the victims and their families. The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is now doing as much as we can to help all those who are affected by this very unfortunate incident.

To officially begin this Symposium, may I first express our heartfelt thanks to the magnificent city of Milan - Italy's fast-beating economic heart, and one of the world's foremost fashion and design capitals, home of elegance, enterprise, for hosting this event. My thanks also go to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council for putting this Symposium together.

A tale of two cities, two economies

For long, Hong Kong and Italy have much in common. We share a passion for creativity, craftsmanship, and elegance. Italian style has captured our hearts.

Our two cities are gateways connecting continents, blending Eastern and Western ingenuity. And we both thrive on openness, creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.

Our economic partnership is flourishing and remarkably diverse, too. In 2024, bilateral merchandise trade reached €7.2 billion. Some 200 Italian companies, from world-beating brands to leading players in banking, insurance, logistics and chocolate, have their regional headquarters, offices or operations in Hong Kong.

Think business, do business, with Hong Kong

Today's symposium is not just about thinking business. It's about doing business. Together.

We've brought with us an 80-strong delegation of Hong Kong business leaders spanning finance, innovation, technology, logistics, and the creative industries. I invite you to rise. Yes, they're here to explore opportunities with you, and to invite you to consider the vast possibilities Hong Kong, Asia's world city, can offer you.

For the next few minutes, allow me to explain why Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to be your long-term partner.

One country, two systems: our enduring strength

Hong Kong's unique strength is premised on our ""one country, two systems"" framework. It gives us the best of both worlds: seamless access to the Chinese Mainland's vast market, and unfettered connectivity with the world, with unparalleled opportunities for business and investment. We are a market economy upholding the common law system with a strong tradition of rule of law, a low and simple tax regime and business practices aligning with the highest international standards.

We are a free port, maintaining a free flow of goods, capital, information and people.

And the ""one country, two systems"" framework is here to stay for the long term, a position reiterated time and again by President Xi Jinping and affirmed at high-level state and party meetings in Beijing.

The rule of law is a defining feature of our city. Our judiciary exercises its powers independently, and the Court of Final Appeal sits in Hong Kong, with six non-permanent judges from overseas common law jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.

Hong Kong also offers robust intellectual property protection. Our legal framework is fully compliant with WTO standards, and our High Court has specialist judges for IP cases. That makes Hong Kong a city you can count on to protect your innovations and creative work. And that, I know, is essential to Italian businesses, where design is both a profession and a passion.

Where Hong Kong stands today

The Hong Kong economy has, again, had a good year.

In international reports, Hong Kong continues to be ranked the world's freest economy, and we are consistently among the top three global financial centres. The IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook this year placed us third, globally. And all three major international credit rating agencies have reaffirmed our strong standing.

Hong Kong is also the gateway to the GBA - the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, a fast-growing, young and affluent market with an increasingly global outlook.

The GBA has a combined GDP of €1.8 trillion, a population of 87 million, and a per capita GDP of about €20,000. It is a vast and promising market for Italian goods and services, offering opportunities from luxury and lifestyle to technology and healthcare.

The Greater Bay Area is also a global leader in innovation and technology. This year, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou science and technology cluster was named the world's number one innovation cluster by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

These and other fundamental strengths make Hong Kong a prime springboard for Italian businesses eager to realise opportunities in China and across Asia.

Hong Kong: a leading IFC

Let me highlight a few areas that I believe will be particularly attractive to Italian businesses, starting with finance.

Hong Kong is one of the world's leading international financial centres. Some 70 of the world's top 100 banks and six of the top 10 global insurance companies operate in our city.

Our stock market, with a market capitalisation of €5.3 trillion, and the Hang Seng Index up by more than 25 per cent to date, is among the world's best performers this year.

We have a singular advantage: the ""Connect Schemes"" – that provide mutual-market access between Hong Kong and the Mainland. For international investors, it is a trusted avenue for accessing the Mainland's capital market. More than 70 per cent of China A-shares' foreign holdings, for example, were acquired through our Stock Connect Scheme.

Italian companies like Prada and Ferretti are already listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and I encourage more Italian companies to pursue dual listings on both Borsa Italiana and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Through our Southbound Connect, Italian companies can tap into Mainland liquidity, gaining a level of access no other international financial centre can provide.

We also invite Italian companies and banks to issue Renminbi bonds in Hong Kong. Our vibrant bond market offers multi-currency options, including USD, euro and RMB. Italian banks can use Hong Kong's Renminbi clearing and settlement system for trade settlement and other Renminbi-denominated financial transactions. That can only enable more efficient trade between Italy and China.

International innovation and technology hub

Hong Kong is also rapidly developing as an international hub for innovation and technology. We focus on four key areas: artificial intelligence, biotech, fintech, and new energy and new materials.

Our academic and research capabilities are world-class. Five of our universities are ranked among the global top 100. Three are ranked in the top 20 globally for AI and data science, and two of our medical schools are among the world's top 25.

We are now building a more complete innovation value chain, one that integrates basic research, commercialisation and advanced manufacturing. To that end, we are attracting strategic enterprises, either world leaders in their fields or companies engaged in cutting-edge technologies. Over the past three years, we have welcomed more than 100 strategic enterprises to Hong Kong, including four of the world's top 10 pharmaceutical companies. They are establishing R&D centres, expanding their operations in Hong Kong and investing in our shared future.

Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport welcome Italian start-ups and innovators. Our I&T centres provide a range of services, from incubation, funding, professional advisory to market development support.

The Northern Metropolis, an area bordering Shenzhen and covering one-third of Hong Kong's landmass, will be the heart of our I&T future. The San Tin Technopole, a cluster similar to the Milan Innovation District, will rise as one of its innovation hubs.

We are working closely with Shenzhen, in a co-operation zone along the border. Within that zone, Mainland capital, talent, goods, data and even biosamples will move freely to Hong Kong, giving companies access to both international and Mainland data, a significant advantage for artificial intelligence, bio and pharmaceutical companies looking to tap the vast Chinese market.

I invite Italian innovators and companies, particularly those in life sciences, precision engineering, advanced manufacturing, and luxury tech, to establish R&D centres and operations in this Northern Metropolis. There, they can collaborate with tech companies from Hong Kong and the Mainland, along with start-ups, universities and research institutions.

Culture and creativity

Finally, let me speak about culture and creativity, an area close to the Italian heart.

Hong Kong is Asia's cultural hub and a rising design hub. Our West Kowloon Cultural District has emerged as a world-class arts and cultural centre. It features M+ Museum, Asia's global museum of contemporary visual arts, design and architecture, as well as the Hong Kong Palace Museum, with more than 900 treasures from Beijing's Palace Museum.

Business of Design Week, or BODW, opening next Monday, has become Asia's most anticipated design event, bringing together creative minds from around the world to showcase their innovation and design excellence.

And we thank Italy for being so kind as the BODW's Partner Country again this year. Italian contributions to furniture design, textile innovation, the intersection of design with technology and sport, and much more will be featured at the Design Week.

Closing remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, the opportunities there for us are both wide-ranging and far-reaching, whether you are in luxury goods, industrial design, fintech, biotech, healthcare, logistics or the creative industries.

Italian businesses can tap into Asia's dynamism through Hong Kong and our connectivity, financial services, innovation and cultural bridges.

You'll hear about that, and much more, in today's panel discussions and the plenary session beginning in just a few minutes.

Let us think business - and do business - together. Build a rewarding future. Together.

Grazie mille. Thank you very much."

The case involved three roller shutters at the front/rear doors and the removal of the protected lobby and wall separating the premises from the carpark of an industrial building at Shing Wan Road, Sha Tin. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owners were prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (November 27), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."
