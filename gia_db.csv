  今期「冬日開懷集」系列網羅五部國際獲奬佳作及四部本地創作節目，並由日本飛行船劇團的人偶音樂劇《傑克與魔豆》（粵語配音版）於十一月中揭開序幕。藝團利用精緻的面具、華麗的服裝和巧妙的舞台道具，將這個家傳戶曉的童話故事活現眼前，讓孩子們與傑克一同攀上魔豆莖，深入巨人巢穴，展開拯救瑪麗公主的奇幻歷險。此節目亦為第三屆「亞藝無疆」藝術節的節目之一。

  馬戲和雜技表演一向深受一家大小歡迎。澳洲彎彎曲曲馬戲團的兩名演員將於十二月上旬帶來形體劇場《搬屋bee bee》作亞洲首演，這部喜劇作品糅合馬戲、雜技、音樂和舞蹈元素，二人化身蜂后和工蜂，以幽默惹笑的肢體動作，展開一段因蜂巢被山火摧毀而攜手重建家園的故事，藉以宣揚環境保育的訊息。日本當代馬戲團間藝工場則於明年一月下旬來港上演《曙光之月》，作品講述一名女孩在月光指引下，克服邪惡巫師們的各種魔法，尋回歸家之路。一眾年輕雜技藝術家巧妙運用配樂、舞台燈光和視覺效果，為馬戲注入新定義，讓觀眾享受一場獨特且精彩絕倫的體驗。

  近年不少合家歡戲偶劇場都加入多媒體元素，引發觀眾無限想像。來自西班牙的奇異手創劇團將於明年一月中上演《太空小狗萊卡》，當中會運用皮影戲、木偶、形體、機械裝置、影像剪接等表演形式，講述流浪小狗萊卡如何成為史上第一位太空探險家，踏上驚心動魄的星際之旅，藉故事鼓勵觀眾思考人類進步與生命的意義。多媒體電影作品《蚊仔發「樂」夢》則於明年二月登陸東九文化中心開幕季，加拿大無尾熊小子將以「一鏡到底」的手法實時拍攝一部有關熱愛爵士樂的「蚊仔」出城闖蕩音樂路的電影，當中運用精緻的微型戲偶、場景和道具，配合現場演奏的原創配樂，讓觀眾同時獲得觀賞電影、劇場和音樂會的豐富體驗。

"LCSD's ""Cheers!"" Series to present family entertainment programmes from November to February next year (with photos)",2025-10-08 11:30,2025-10-08 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100200663.htm,"  The annual ""Cheers!"" Series, presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, will be held from November to February next year. Offering a variety of family entertainment programmes ranging from puppetry, acrobatics, circus, dance, music and theatre to multimedia shows and musicals, the series will showcase fabulous performances by nine visiting and local performing groups that will delight audiences during the festive season.

  This edition of the series will feature five international award-winning productions and four local programmes. Starting the series in mid-November is the puppetry musical ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" (dubbed in Cantonese) by the Theater Company Hikosen from Japan. With delicate masks, beautiful costumes and ingenious stage props, the troupe will bring this beloved fairy tale to life, allowing children to join Jack on a fantastical adventure in climbing the beanstalk grown from magical beans and venturing into the giant's lair to rescue Princess Mary. This programme is also part of the third Asia+ Festival.

  Circus and acrobatic performances have always been popular among young audiences and their families. Two performers from the Australian ARC Circus Dance Theatre will present the Asian premiere of the physical theatre production ""A Bee Story"" in early December. This comedic show blends elements of circus, acrobatics, music and dance to tell the story of Queen Bee and Worker Bee, who work together to rebuild their hive after it is destroyed by a bushfire, conveying a message on environmental conservation. The Japanese contemporary circus company, Cirquework, will perform ""YOAH"" in late January next year. The story follows a girl who overcomes the magic of evil wizards and finds her way home with the moon's guidance. A team of young acrobatic artists will skilfully integrate music, stage lighting and visual effects to redefine the concept of a circus, enabling audiences to enjoy a unique and captivating journey.

  Many family-friendly puppet theatre works have incorporated multimedia elements to unleash imaginations and creativity in recent years. Xirriquiteula Teatre from Spain will present ""Laika"" in mid-January next year, employing shadow play, puppets, physical theatre, installations and film montage to tell the story of how Laika the stray puppy becomes the first space explorer to take on a thrilling adventure into the universe. The narrative encourages audiences to reflect on the human drive towards progress and the true meaning of life. A multimedia theatre show, ""The Storyville Mosquito"", will be staged in the opening season of the East Kowloon Cultural Centre in February next year. Canada's Kid Koala will film a real-time movie about a jazz-loving mosquito's musical adventure in the city in one take by using exquisite miniature puppets, sets and props alongside a live original music score, offering audiences a multifaceted experience combining cinema, theatre and a concert setting.

  The above programmes will be accompanied by various extension activities such as meet-the-artist sessions, backstage tours or workshops. For details, please visit www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/Programme/en/f_entertainment/groups_1883.html.

  Local art groups will also present a rich line-up of performances, including the Hong Kong Oratorio Society's concert ""The Messiah"" to commemorate the 340th anniversary of Handel, the Master of Oratorios; the multimedia children's puppet theatre ""One Lap - 16000km: The Little Penguin's Way Home"" by puppet theatre troupe Make Friends With Puppet; the non-verbal full mask theatre ""Plastic Island"" by Free-To-Play; and the tap theatre ""The Making of the Perfect Mulan"" by the professional tap dance company R&T (Rhythm & Tempo) with child performers. Details of these programmes will be announced on the above-mentioned website in due course.

  For programme dates, venues and ticket prices of the ""Cheers!"" Series, please see the Annex. Tickets will be available from October 10 (Friday) onwards at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk).

立法會十七題：僱員被拖欠工資的情況,2025-10-08 11:15,2025-10-08 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800249.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上陸頌雄議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見指出本港經濟發展面臨諸多挑戰，當中建造業、飲食業及零售業接連有企業倒閉，欠薪問題頻發，令工人權益受損。根據《僱傭條例》（第57章），僱主在工資期屆滿後七天內仍未支付工資給僱員即可被檢控，一經定罪最高可被判罰款35萬元及監禁三年。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年勞工處接獲僱員被欠薪的個案宗數，以及每宗個案平均每人被欠薪的金額分別為何，並按行業列出分項數字；

（二）過去三年，每年勞工處就有關拖欠工資作出檢控（包括被判罰款、監禁或社會服務令）的個案宗數為何；被判罰款的個案中，每宗個案平均被判罰款的金額為何；

（三）就欠薪個案，勞工處有何準則決定是否向相關人士提出刑事檢控；

（四）有否檢視現時有關欠薪的罰則是否具備足夠的阻嚇力；當局有何措施進一步加強監察和規管，以杜絕發生僱員被欠薪，以及破產欠薪保障基金被濫用的情況；及

（五）有何措施進一步加強宣傳教育，以提醒僱主切勿拖欠工資，避免以身試法？

答覆：

主席：

勞工處採取多管齊下的策略，包括積極跟進舉報個案、搜集情報、主動巡查、深入調查及檢控，致力打擊欠薪罪行。除嚴厲執法外，勞工處亦經不同渠道提醒僱主必須履行支付工資的法定責任；以及鼓勵僱員應及早追討欠薪，保障自身的權益。

就議員的提問，現答覆如下︰

（一）二○二二年至二○二四年，勞工處處理因工資爭議而發生的個案按行業劃分的數字見附件一。勞工處沒有備存每宗個案平均每名僱員被欠薪金額的數字。

（二）二○二二年至二○二四年，勞工處每年就涉嫌違反《僱傭條例》有關支付工資規定的僱主，提出檢控並完成聆訊的傳票數目、被定罪的傳票數目及每年被定罪傳票平均罰款的數字載於附件二。

（三）勞工處處理涉嫌欠薪的個案時，如發現僱主可能涉及違反《僱傭條例》的罪行，會邀請有關僱員提供進一步資料；當有表面證據顯示僱主涉嫌違例，會邀請僱員出任控方證人，指證涉嫌違例的僱主。勞工處根據律政司發布的《檢控守則》審視是否有足夠證據證明相關僱主故意及無合理辯解違反《僱傭條例》有關支付工資的規定。如有足夠證據，勞工處會提出檢控。

（四）勞工處勞資關係科與工作夥伴及相關持份者保持緊密聯繫，並從不同渠道收集及評估有關欠薪的情報。如獲悉個別僱主有欠薪情況，勞工處會主動接觸有關企業的負責人，提醒及要求他們必須根據《僱傭條例》及僱傭合約支付僱員的工資；並持續監察支薪情況。

根據《僱傭條例》，僱主如故意及無合理辯解而不依時向僱員支付工資，最高可被罰款35萬元及監禁三年。如該罪行是在法團的董事、經理、秘書或其他類似人員的同意或縱容或疏忽下所犯，則該人即屬犯了相同罪行，可被判相同的刑罰。經多年來的嚴厲執法，僱主普遍明白拖欠工資的嚴重後果。

為防止濫用破產欠薪保障基金（破欠基金），政府已成立跨部門專責小組，成員包括勞工處、警務處商業罪案調查科及破產管理署的代表，加強主動偵查可疑個案。勞工處嚴謹審批及緊密跟進每宗破欠基金申請。如發現公司負責人涉嫌非法轉移資產、盜竊公款、藉欺騙手段逃避債務、沒有妥善備存公司帳目等，勞工處會將案件轉交警務處及／或破產管理署跟進。另外，如發現任何人士就破欠基金申請虛報資料，勞工處會採取執法行動。

（五）勞工處經不同途徑進行廣泛宣傳，包括播放電視宣傳短片及電台宣傳聲帶、於報章及主要商會刊物刊登廣告、舉辦展覽、張貼海報及派發單張等，提醒僱主履行支付工資的法定責任。勞工處亦設立並廣泛宣傳投訴熱線（28152200），呼籲及便利僱員舉報欠薪個案。"
LCQ17: Default on payment of wages to employees,2025-10-08 11:15,2025-10-08 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800251.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Luk Chung-hung and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

 There are views pointing out that the economic development of Hong Kong faces many challenges, including a series of business closures and frequent wage default problems in the construction, catering and retail industries which impair workers' rights. Under the Employment Ordinance (Cap. 57), employers who fail to pay wages to employees within seven days after the expiry of the wage period is liable on conviction to a maximum penalty of a fine of $350,000 and imprisonment for three years. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of cases of default on payment of wages to employees received by the Labour Department (LD) in each of the past three years, as well as the average amount of wages in arrears per person in each case, together with a breakdown by industry;

(2) of the number of cases in which the LD initiated prosecutions against wage default cases in each of the past three years (including the cases in which fines, imprisonment or community service orders were imposed); among the cases with fines imposed, the average amount of fine in each case;

(3) regarding wage default cases, of the criteria adopted by the LD for determining whether criminal prosecution against the relevant parties will be initiated;

(4) whether it has reviewed if the current penalties for wage defaults have sufficient deterrent effect; of the measures put in place by the authorities to further strengthen monitoring and regulation to eradicate defaults on payment of wages to employees and abuses of the Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund; and

(5) of the measures in place to further strengthen publicity and education efforts to remind employers not to default on payment of wages and risk violating the law?

Reply:

President,

 The Labour Department (LD) is committed to combating wage offences through multi-pronged strategies, including proactive follow-up of reported cases, intelligence gathering, proactive inspections, in-depth investigations and prosecutions. In addition to stringent law enforcement, the LD reminds employers through various channels of their statutory obligation to pay wages, and encouraging employees to promptly pursue outstanding wages to protect their rights and interests.

 In response to the Member's question, the reply is provided below:

(1) From 2022 to 2024, the number of cases caused by wage disputes and handled by the LD with a breakdown by industry is at Annex 1. The LD does not keep the figures on the average amount of wages in arrears per employee in each case.

(2) From 2022 to 2024, the number of summonses heard in respect of wage offences under the Employment Ordinance (EO) prosecuted by the LD each year, the number of summonses convicted and the average fine for summonses convicted each year are at Annex 2.

(3) While handling cases with suspected wages in arrears, the LD will invite the employees to provide further information if it is discovered that the employers may have violated the EO. If there is prima facie evidence of contravening the EO, the employees will be invited to act as prosecution witnesses to testify against the employers who are suspected to have contravened the law. In accordance with the Prosecution Code promulgated by the Department of Justice, the LD will assess whether there is sufficient evidence to prove that an employer has wilfully and without reasonable excuse contravened the wage payment requirements under the EO. If there is sufficient evidence, the LD will initiate prosecution.

(4) The Labour Relations Division of the LD has been maintaining close liaison with working partners and relevant stakeholders, gathering and assessing the intelligence from different sources on wage defaults. If the LD is aware of an individual employer with wage default, the LD will proactively reach out to the persons-in-charge of the concerned establishment, remind and urge them for settlement of employees' wages in accordance with the EO and the terms of employment contracts; and keep track of the status of wage payment.

 According to the EO, an employer who wilfully and without reasonable excuse fails to pay wages to an employee when it becomes due is subject to a fine up to $350,000 and imprisonment for three years. If the default of wages is committed with the consent, connivance of, or negligence of body corporate's director, manager, secretary or other similar officer, then such person shall also be guilty of the like offence and is liable to the same penalty. Upon stringent enforcement of the law over the years, employers are generally cognisant of the serious consequences of wage defaults.

 To prevent the abuse of the Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund (PWIF), the Government has set up an inter-departmental task force comprising representatives from the LD, the Commercial Crime Bureau of the Hong Kong Police Force (the Police) and the Official Receiver's Office (ORO) to strengthen proactive investigation of suspicious cases. The LD rigorously verifies and closely monitors every application to the PWIF. If the company responsible persons are suspected of illegal transfer of assets, theft of company money, evasion of liabilities by deception, failure to keep proper accounting records, etc., the LD will refer such cases to the Police and/or ORO for follow-up. Besides, if any person is found to have provided false information in respect of a PWIF application, the LD would take enforcement action.

(5) The LD will continue to conduct extensive publicity, including broadcasting television and radio announcements in the public interest, placing advertisements in newspapers and publications of major employer associations, organising exhibitions, displaying posters and distributing leaflets, to remind employers to fulfil their statutory obligations to pay wages. The LD has also set up and widely publicised a complaint hotline (28152200) to encourage and facilitate employees to report wage default cases."
立法會五題：鄰里支援幼兒照顧計劃,2025-10-08 11:10,2025-10-08 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800238.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上鄧家彪議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

政府於二○二四年《施政報告》宣布將鄰里支援幼兒照顧計劃（照顧計劃）的服務名額增加至2 500個，為有需要的家庭提供具彈性的幼兒照顧服務。然而，去年屯門區曾發生一宗涉及由社區保姆照顧的嬰兒懷疑受虐而引致嚴重受傷的事件，令社會關注社區保姆的服務質素。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府自去年四月起，增加社區保姆的服務獎勵金，亦在去年第四季增加社區保姆的服務名額，政府有何具體措施與機制提升及確保社區保姆的質素，尤其是有否為需要照顧三歲以下的幼童、少數族裔兒童或殘疾兒童的社區保姆提供額外培訓；如有，詳情為何；

（二）有否統計，現時社區保姆的數目、學歷或專業資格分別為何，並按年齡組別（以每10歲為一組）以表列出分項數字；

（三）有否統計，現時擔任社區保姆的人士同時也有照顧其子女的人數，以及其家中有安裝監察鏡頭的數目分別為何，並以表列出分項數字；

（四）有否設立恆常機制評估社區保姆的服務，以確保其服務質素；如有，相關評估指標為何；

（五）現時照顧計劃下各區使用相關服務的兒童及社區保姆人數分別為何；

（六）據報上述虐兒事件已發生超過18個月，但其調查仍未有結論，該事件的最新調查進展為何；社會福利署有否在該事件發生後對提供相關社區保姆服務的機構進行調查；如有，調查結果為何；如否，原因為何；

（七）鑑於有意見認為，儘管醫療人員已盡心盡力治療在上述虐兒事件中受傷的兒童，但由於該兒童已嚴重受傷，其發展極有可能長遠受影響，政府會如何在復康、福利、教育等範疇向該兒童提供適切的支援與協助；及

（八）因應上述虐兒事件，政府有否提出任何具針對性的改善措施，以提升照顧計劃的服務質素；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

（一）、（四）及（八）社會福利署（社署）津助非政府機構營辦鄰里支援幼兒照顧計劃（照顧計劃），為有服務需要的家長在鄰里層面提供彈性的日間幼兒照顧服務。

為確保服務質素及保護接受服務的兒童，社署要求服務營辦機構必須設有招募、評估、篩選及培訓社區保姆的機制，並為有需要的家庭配對合適的保姆。營辦機構的社工須定期向提供服務的社區保姆進行家訪，而機構的幼兒工作員亦會每月為社區保姆提供個別培訓／督導。此外，營辦機構亦須持續評估及跟進社區保姆的表現。

自二○二四年九月起，所有參與照顧計劃的社區保姆必須接受14小時的基礎訓練，內容由社署統一制定，包括嬰幼兒（即三歲以下的幼童）生理和心理發展、成長的特別發展里程和需要、照顧和溝通技巧、家居安全和衞生、意外和特別事故的處理等，以及在配對服務時提供與少數族裔兒童相關的基礎知識。獲安排照顧有特殊需要兒童（包括特殊學習需要兒童）的社區保姆須接受額外四小時的進階培訓，學習有關知識和技巧。由於照顧計劃不會安排社區保姆照顧殘疾兒童，相關培訓不包括照顧殘疾兒童的知識。完成培訓後，營辦機構須評估社區保姆的幼兒照顧技巧和知識、提供照顧服務的信心，以及家居環境，如果認為在上述各方面均適合提供照顧服務，才會安排社區保姆提供服務。

（二）截至二○二五年六月，照顧計劃的社區保姆數目按年齡組別及教育程度分別表列如下：

表一：年齡組別

（五）截至二○二五年六月，照顧計劃按區議會分區的社區保姆數目及二○二四至二五年度使用服務的兒童人數載於附件。

（六）及（七）相關專業人員一直以多專業合作模式為該兒童及其家庭提供所需協助，包括安排涉事兒童接受醫療診治及康復服務，以及就其照顧需要向其家庭提供輔導、經濟援助和其他支援服務。有關營辦機構已就事件向社署提交報告，確認該社區保姆為涉事兒童提供服務前已接受並通過照顧計劃的評估。由於警方目前仍在調查該宗案件，現階段不宜評論案件詳情。我們會繼續按該兒童及其家庭的需要提供適切協助。"
LCQ5: Neighbourhood Support Child Care Project,2025-10-08 11:10,2025-10-08 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800243.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Tang Ka-piu and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

 The Government announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the service places under the Neighbourhood Support Child Care Project (the Care Project) would be increased to 2500, providing flexible child care services for families in need. However, an incident took place last year in the Tuen Mun District involving a suspected case of abuse leading to serious injuries of an infant under the care of a home-based child carer (HCC), arousing public concern about the service quality of HCC. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the Government has increased the incentive payment for HCCs since April last year and increased the service places for HCCs in the fourth quarter of last year, of the specific measures and mechanisms put in place by the Government to enhance and ensure the quality of HCCs, particularly whether additional training has been provided for HCCs who need to take care of young children under the age of three, ethnic minority children or children with disabilities; if so, of the details;

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the current number of HCCs, their academic qualifications or professional qualifications, with a tabulated breakdown by age group (each group covering 10 years of age);

(3) whether it has compiled statistics on the current number of persons who work as HCCs and take care of their own children at the same time, as well as the number of surveillance cameras installed in their homes, and set out the breakdown in a table;

(4) whether it has established a regular mechanism to access HCC services to ensure their service quality; if so, of the relevant assessment indicators;

(5) of the respective numbers of children currently using the relevant services under the Care Project and HCCs in various districts;

(6) it has been reported that the aforesaid child abuse incident took place more than 18 months ago, yet its investigation remains inconclusive, of the latest progress of the investigation into the incident; whether the Social Welfare Department has conducted an investigation into the organisation providing the relevant HCC services after the incident; if so, of the investigation results; if not, the reasons for that;

(7) as there are views that despite the dedicated efforts of healthcare personnel to treat the child injured in the aforesaid child abuse incident, the child's development is likely to be affected in the long run because of serious injuries, how the Government will provide appropriate support and assistance to the child in areas such as rehabilitation, welfare and education; and

(8) in response to the aforesaid child abuse incident, whether the Government has proposed any targeted improvement measures to enhance the service quality of the Care Project; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

(1), (4) and (8) The Social Welfare Department (SWD) provides subventions to non-governmental organisations for operating the Neighbourhood Support Child Care Project (NSCCP), which provides flexible day child care service at the neighbourhood level for parents with service needs.

 To ensure service quality and protect children who receive services, the SWD requires service operators to establish mechanisms to recruit, assess, screen and train up home-based child carers (HCCs), and match suitable HCCs for families in need. Social workers of service operators are required to conduct regular home visits to HCCs who provide services. Child care workers of service operators also provide HCCs with monthly individual training/supervision. In addition, service operators are also required to continuously evaluate and follow up on the performance of HCCs.

 From September 2024 onwards, all HCCs participating in NSCCP are required to receive 14 hours of basic training, the content of which is standardised and formulated by the SWD. The training includes infant and child (i.e. children aged below three) physical and psychological development, special development milestones and needs of growth, care and communication skills, home safety and hygiene as well as handling of accidents/special incidents, and basic knowledge related to ethnic minority children would be provided during service matching. HCCs who are arranged to take care of children with special needs (including children with special learning needs) are required to receive additional four hours of advanced training to acquire relevant knowledge and skills. As HCCs would not be arranged to take care of children with disabilities, the relevant training does not include knowledge on taking care of children with disabilities. After the completion of the training programme, service operators are required to evaluate the child care skills and knowledge of HCCs, their confidence in providing care services, and their home environment. HCCs would only be arranged to provide services if all of their aforementioned aspects are considered as satisfactory and service-ready.

(2) The number of HCCs of NSCCP as at June 2025 are tabulated by age group and educational attainment as follows:

Table 1: Age Group

(3) The SWD does not maintain information on whether HCCs take care of their own children at the same time or whether they have installed surveillance cameras in their homes.

(5) The number of HCCs as at June 2025 and the number of children received services under NSCCP in 2024-25, by District Council districts, are set out at Annex.

(6) and (7) Relevant professionals, through multi-disciplinary collaboration, have been providing the child and her family with necessary assistance, which include arranging medical consultation, treatment and rehabilitation services for the child concerned, as well as counseling, financial assistance, and other support services for her family according to the care requirements of the child. The service operator concerned has submitted a report to the SWD regarding the incident, confirming that the HCC had undergone and passed the assessment of NSCCP before providing services to the child. As the Police is still investigating the case, it is not appropriate to comment on the details of the case at this stage. We will continue to provide appropriate assistance based on the needs of the child and her family."

問題：

本會於二○二三年十一月十五日通過「政府帶頭檢討外判制度」的議員議案，要求政府帶頭檢討改革外判制度，包括優先外判給聘用本地專業人士的本地企業，以讓本地僱員都能獲得工作經驗及提升競爭力。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（二）過去三年，政府透過外判服務合約或由外判機構所聘用的本地專業人員數目為何（按專業列出），以及當中涉及的金額為何；及

（三）政府就涉及聘用專業人員或提供專業服務的外判服務投標書的評審標準為何，例如會否要求由本地專業人員提供服務？

答覆：

主席：

就林新強議員的提問，本局諮詢公務員事務局、發展局、律政司及法律援助署（法援署）後，現回覆如下：

（一）公務員事務局表示，過去三個財政年度（即二○二二／二三至二○二四／二五年度），政府34個專業職系的職位空缺總數分別為672、755及720個，分別佔整體專業職系職位約百分之六點七、百分之七點四及百分之七點零，較同期公務員整體空缺率為低。當中以工程師、醫生、牙科醫生及政府律師職系相對有較多空缺。

政府部門一向有機制處理出缺職位的工作，以盡量減低對部門工作或公共服務的影響。相關措施包括透過招聘、晉升，或由合適的人員署任，如有需要亦可考慮延長屆退休年齡公務員的服務或聘用非公務員合約僱員等。部門亦會透過重訂工作優次、重組工作、善用科技及精簡程序，從而優化公務員人力資源的運用，持續提升政府效率和服務。

（二）及（三）若政府部門以外判方式應付其服務或人力需求，一般會透過公開公平的方式採購服務，並按各自需要，制訂其招標規格和採購合約的要求，包括要求相關人員符合相關的本地專業資格或相關要求。

由於政府部門的外判服務合約均有機會涉及聘用專業人員，而外判服務由部門直接進行採購，財經事務及庫務局並沒有備存有關合約的詳細資料。由於政府的專業人員職系眾多，因應議員問題第（一）部分就法律、工程和會計服務專業人員的關注，以下回覆將聚焦相關外判服務合約。

就法律服務而言，律政司和法援署會因應其需要委託外判大律師／律師處理檢控、民事和法律援助案件。在委託大律師／律師處理案件時，部門一般會考慮案件的性質和複雜程度、大律師／律師的資歷和專長等因素。除了律政司和法援署外，其他部門亦可能會因應個別需要而外判法律服務。

律政司過去三個財政年度僱用外判法律服務及有關的專業人員的費用表列如下：

雖然法援署沒有就本地及非本地大律師／律師數目作分項統計，惟獲委派法律援助案件的絕大部分為本地律師。

在工務工程方面，相關部門會按工程項目需要委聘顧問公司提供專業人員以執行有關工程規劃、研究及設計的工作，以及在工程建造階段提供駐工地人員負責工程合約的管理及監督工作。發展局及相關部門過去三個財政年度的顧問合約聘用專業人員數目和費用的估算資料表列如下：

雖然發展局及相關部門並沒有就上述專業人員的本地及非本地人員數目作分項統計，顧問公司聘用的專業人員及駐工地專業人員絕大部分為本地專業人員。

為確保承接政府合約的顧問公司具質素和能力，發展局制定了認可顧問公司名單，供符合准入條件（包括聘用專業人員數目要求）的本地及非本地顧問公司申請加入。一般而言，專業人員必須持有相關香港法定專業學會所認可的本地或非本地專業資格；但准入條件並沒有規範顧問公司必須聘用本地專業人員。在評審顧問合約標書的經驗要求時，採購部門亦會考慮顧問公司及其提供的專業人員在本地及非本地的相關經驗。

在會計服務方面，政府部門透過外判服務合約聘用的服務包括為部門推行的項目提供顧問服務和運作支援服務等，部分服務或會涉及聘用會計師。由於部門因應運作需要自行聘用上述服務，財經事務及庫務局並沒有備存相關服務涉及本地會計師數目和所涉及金額的相關資料。"
LCQ11: Government outsourced services involving employment of professionals,2025-10-08 11:05,2025-10-08 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800239.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Lam San-keung and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  This Council passed the motion on ""Taking the lead by the Government to review the outsourcing system"" at its meeting on November 15, 2023, urging the Government to take the lead to review and reform the outsourcing system, including giving priority to local enterprises which employ local professionals when outsourcing, so that local employees can gain work experience and enhance their competitiveness. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of vacancies in government professional grades (e.g. lawyers, accountants and engineers) in each of the past three years; whether it has reviewed which professional grades are facing chronic manpower shortages;

(2) of the number of local professionals employed by the Government through outsourced service contracts or by outsourcing organisations in the past three years (set out by profession), and the amounts of money involved; and

(3) of the criteria adopted by the Government for evaluating tenders for outsourced services involving the employment of professionals or the provision of professional services, such as whether it will require the services to be provided by local professionals?

Reply:

President,

  Having consulted the Civil Service Bureau (CSB), the Development Bureau (DEVB), the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Legal Aid Department (LAD), our reply to the question raised by the Hon Lam San-keung is as follows:

(1) According to CSB, in the past three financial years (i.e. 2022-23 to 2024-25), the total number of vacancies among the 34 professional grades in the Government was 672, 755 and 720 respectively, accounting for approximately 6.7 per cent, 7.4 per cent, and 7.0 per cent of the total positions of the professional grades. Such vacancy rates were lower than the overall vacancy rates of the civil service in the same period. Among them, vacancies were relatively higher in the grades of Engineer, Medical and Health Officer, Dental Officer and Government Counsel.

  Government departments have all along put in place mechanisms to handle the duties of vacant posts to minimise disruption to departmental operations or public services. Relevant measures include recruitment, promotion or appointment of suitable officers to take up acting appointments. Where necessary, consideration may also be given to extending the service of civil servants beyond the retirement age, employing non-civil service contract staff, etc. Departments would also re-prioritise and re-organise their work, capitalise on technology solutions, and streamline work processes, with a view to optimising the use of the civil service manpower resources and enhancing efficiency and service delivery of the Government continuously.

(2) and (3) Government departments which address their service or manpower needs through outsourcing generally procure services in an open and fair manner, and draw up tender specifications and requirements of procurement contracts in accordance with their respective needs, including setting requirements for the relevant personnel to meet applicable local professional qualifications or pertinent requirements.

  As outsourced service contracts in government departments may involve the engagement of professionals and such outsourced services are directly procured by the departments, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) does not maintain any details of the relevant contracts. Considering the diverse range of professional grades in the Government, the following reply specifically addresses outsourced service contracts related to legal, engineering and accounting professionals in response to the Hon Member's concern raised in part (1) of the question.

  As regards legal services, DoJ and LAD engage outsourced counsel/solicitors based on their needs to handle prosecution, civil and legal aid cases. When engaging counsel/solicitors to handle cases, departments generally take into account various factors such as the nature and complexity of the cases, qualifications and expertise of the counsel/solicitors, etc. Besides DoJ and LAD, other departments may also outsource legal services having regard to their individual needs.

  DoJ's expenses for engaging outsourced legal services and related professionals in the past three financial years are tabulated as follows:




Financial year
Expenses for engaging legal services and related professionals
			($ million) (approximate)
Estimated percentage of expenses attributed to local personnel/entities (Note1)


2022-23
190
97.8%


2023-24
199
97.5%


2024-25
180
98.6%



Note 1: ""Local personnel/entities"" mainly refers to local lawyers or law firms, and includes professionals such as arbitrators or related firms/companies.

  The numbers of counsel and solicitors to whom LAD assigned legal aid cases and the relevant expenses in the past three financial years are tabulated as follows:




Financial year
Number of counsel
Number of solicitors
Expenses associated with counsel and solicitors ($million) (approximate) (Note2)


2022-23
474
961
1,025


2023-24
460
903
953


2024-25
496
922
930



Note 2: The figures refer to the actual amount paid in the respective financial year, which may include expenses for services rendered in previous financial year(s).

  Although LAD does not maintain a breakdown of statistics by the number of local and non-local counsel/solicitors, the vast majority of those who were assigned legal aid cases were local lawyers.

  In terms of public works, relevant departments engage consultants to provide professionals for undertaking the work on project planning, investigation and design, and to arrange resident site staff for contract management and site supervision during the construction stage, having regard to the needs of works projects. As for the number of professionals engaged under consultancy agreements by DEVB and relevant departments as well as the expenses, estimations for the past three financial years are tabulated as follows:




Professionals engaged under architectural and
			engineering-associated consultancy agreements (Note 3)

Note 4: The above professional resident site staff include engineers, architects, surveyors and landscape architects.

  Although DEVB and relevant departments do not maintain a breakdown of statistics by local and non-local personnel for the above professionals, the vast majority of professionals and resident site staff engaged by consultants are local professionals.

  To ensure the quality and capability of consultants undertaking government contracts, DEVB has drawn up lists of approved consultants which allow local and non-local consultants fulfilling the admission requirements (including the requirement on the number of professionals engaged) to apply for inclusion. In general, professionals must hold local or non-local professional qualifications recognised by relevant statutory professional institutes in Hong Kong. However, it is not compulsory for consultants to engage local professionals under the admission requirements. Moreover, when evaluating experience requirements in proposals for consultancy agreements, procuring departments will consider relevant local and non-local experience of the consultants and their professionals.

  As for accounting services, the services procured by government departments through outsourced service contracts include the provision of consultancy services and operational support services for their initiatives, etc., some of which may involve the employment of accountants. As departments procure the above services based on their operational needs, FSTB does not maintain relevant statistics on the number of local accountants engaged for the related services and the expenses involved."

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

市民可透過以下途徑，取得更多資料：衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111）、中暑專頁、紫外線專頁；天文台「打電話問天氣」（1878 200）、最新天氣報告及預報、紫外線指​數、遠足及攀山天氣資訊；及勞工處於工作暑熱警告生效期間，對戶外工作的僱員和其僱主發布有關預防中暑措施的新聞公報。"
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-10-08 06:46,2025-10-08 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800123.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 8) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得27宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（九月二十八日至十月四日）廣東省新增3 181宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與九月二十一日至九月二十七日的一周相若（3 153宗）。大部分個案（2 480宗）在江門市錄得，全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。近期江門市基孔肯雅熱疫情的上升趨勢得到初步遏制，但仍在較高水平波動。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-07 17:35,2025-10-07 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/07/P2025100700483.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 7), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 27 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 3 181 new CF cases in Guangdong in the past week (September 28 to October 4), which is more or less the same level as the previous week's 3 153 cases (September 21 to 27). The majority of cases (2 480 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. While the recent upward trend of CF cases in Jiangmen has been preliminarily contained, the number of cases still fluctuates at a relatively high level.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

A male passenger, aged 40, arrived in Hong Kong from Penang, Malaysia, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected heroin concealed in his check-in suitcase. He was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The cases will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (October 8).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
