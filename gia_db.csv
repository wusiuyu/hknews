The delegations from both sides were headed by the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, Mr Chan Tsz-tat, and the Vice-Minister of the GACC, Mr Zhao Zenglian, respectively.

Mr Chan welcomed Mr Zhao's visit to Hong Kong Customs with his delegation. Witnessed by Mr Zhao and Mr Chan, the Assistant Commissioner (Boundary and Ports) of Customs and Excise, Ms Chiang Yi-lee, and the Deputy Director General of the Office of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Affairs of the GACC, Mr Zhang Xiaohui, signed the Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) regarding the inspection and quarantine of air-to-land transhipment of fresh fruits to the Chinese Mainland via Hong Kong.

The signing of the MoC will enhance the efficient and smooth operation of the Air-Land Fresh Lane between the two customs authorities, deepen collaboration in clearance and quarantine, improve the efficiency and safety of the transhipment of fresh food products, and promote high-quality development of fresh food trade in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

Afterwards, both sides discussed multiple co-operative issues, including combating smuggling, intelligence exchange, consumer product safety, trade facilitation measures, and personnel training.

On the same day, the delegations toured the Customs Radar Monitoring Command Centre at the Customs Marine Base on Stonecutters Island and took a ride on a sector patrol launch to visit sea-borne smuggling black spots to learn about the maritime enforcement work of Hong Kong Customs."

Speech by STL at International Bunker Industry Association Annual Convention 2025 (English only) (with photo),2025-11-19 13:21,2025-11-19 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900339.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA) Annual Convention 2025 today (November 19):

Constantinos (Chair of the IBIA and Bunker Director at the Star Bulk Carriers, Mr Constantinos Capetanakis), Alexander (Executive Director of the IBIA, Mr Alexander Prokopakis), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, and many friends, old and new,

  Welcome again to Hong Kong. Today is getting a little bit cold and I know that every one of you has made an effort to arrive here to make it for this forum. I can assure you that with the Chair's remarks, you would have a lot of takeaways from this forum this morning. It is actually a distinct honour for Hong Kong to host the IBIA's premier flagship event here for the very first time. Judging from what Constantinos just said, I think Hong Kong and the IBIA share a lot of the same vision. I truly agree with the particular phrase you mentioned that we need leadership and we need action and solutions, rather than just rules or discussions inside closed doors, we need to go to the ground. We also need to lead everybody for a joint solution towards the green transformation.

  The IBIA's decision to host this event in Hong Kong is absolutely spot on. As you all know, we're renowned for our highly efficient, professional and smart port services, consistently ranking us among the world's top international maritime centres. This is complemented by our thriving bunkering activities, which put us seventh in the world, second in our country and first in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. We haven't said so in the past, but as we move on from conventional fuel to greener fuel for shipping vessels, we dig out our figures and records. It seems that it is not just that we have been doing good and ranking high in terms of cargo throughput, but we have also been making use of our pivotal position to provide fuel for ocean-going vessels over the decades. Therefore, it seems more than suitable to discuss the latest developments in bunkering in the busiest bunkering hub and the most happening port in the region. So I can assure you, Alexander, you have chosen the right place to host this forum since your visit last year.

  Our strength in bunkering is no coincidence: Hong Kong is strategically located at the southernmost tip of southern China right next to international fairways, making it a perfect place for ships to refuel. And now, as the entire marine community is pivoting to decarbonisation, a great opportunity lies right ahead of us. By leveraging this strategic position, Hong Kong is poised to develop into a leading centre for green maritime fuel bunkering as well as trading - ensuring we continue to meet the industry's evolving needs for top-notch, sustainable bunkering services. In fact, to support the International Maritime Organization (IMO)'s vision of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from international shipping by or around 2050, the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government took action quickly, and we are determined to do so, notwithstanding the hiccups recently on the schedule of the IMO. Exactly one year ago, we laid out a clear pathway and roadmap for our port in the Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering promulgated. 

  The thinking behind our Action Plan is very simple: we need to offer the industry a clear direction on green maritime fuel adoption, supported by policies that can turn our shared vision for a green maritime fuel bunkering and trading centre into reality. That's why we've set out in the Action Plan five main strategies - Green Fuel, Green Port, Green Incentives, Green Collaboration and Green Talents. We have 10 specific measures underpinning these five strategies.

  Starting with Green Fuels, we make clear that Hong Kong will adopt a multi-fuel strategy, with the most commonly used or explored fuels such as LNG (liqified natural gas), biodiesel, methanol, ammonia and hydrogen being the fuels of choice. We then set out to build up a supply chain of such fuels in Hong Kong, from locating sources of green fuels in the proximity, that is the Chinese Mainland, which is conveniently right next to us and have been the largest supplier of such fuels by far, to developing storage facilities and providing bunkering infrastructure in Hong Kong. We are small, but I think we will be targeted and focused in providing, putting and rolling out storage facilities, infrastructure support, so as to allow Hong Kong to provide a miniature of the ecosystem that is advocated under the IBIA. Crucially, this strategy is already backed by concrete regulatory actions. Just to name a few, we have passed the enabling legislation, published technical requirements and guidelines, and approved a duty exemption for methanol bunkering. In the old days, there used to be some industry using the methanol for making wine. And that is not good for health. That is why we have updated legislation on charging duty on methanol. It might have just looked like a simple piece of legislation; we went around the government administration, particularly the health authorities, the doctors and the medical practitioners. While we respect their professionalism, it took us some time to convince them that we are now looking for bunkering only, for our outward-looking ships and not winemaking. While we have already amended our law, we promised that we will input, inject some of the tightened safeguarding measures, from the customs point of view, to make sure that there will be no abuse of this tax exemption. But this is a right signal that we have expedited, and we hope to see the first-ever methanol bunkering operation soon in Hong Kong.

  These are the precise policy measures, and legislative and supporting measures that we promised. We are designed to make green maritime fuel bunkering a practical and competitive reality. One year on, we have indeed come a long way, with commercial LNG and biodiesel bunkering services now available in Hong Kong and nearly 200 000 tonnes of green maritime fuels bunkered to date in Hong Kong. Still a lot of our industry players are not aware that Hong Kong has been treated to that point. They think that we are still at the initiation stage, still at the drafting stage. But I need to publicise more and talk more that we are actually actionable. We put things into operation, and it's not just for pilots, but it was for commercial operation. The first methanol bunkering operation, as I just mentioned, will also happen before long, while we will start looking into ammonia and hydrogen bunkering and hope to tell the market where we stand on it soon.

  We fully recognise that the maritime industry is global by nature. I also mentioned and discussed at the ICS (International Chamber of Shipping) summit, we do not treat Hong Kong-based shipping companies as local companies. We treat them all along as global companies. We are globally based. We need to take their concerns and anxieties, arising from all the geopolitical circumstances, dear to our hearts. We have to listen, facilitate and help them to resolve and to take solutions. A truly green transition can't happen in isolation; it demands collaboration between ports available worldwide. First, we have been supporting our port operators in their effort to reduce carbon emissions and create a greener port. But just as importantly, we are looking outward, we are actively identifying ports with which to establish green shipping corridors. I would like to learn more from the IBIA, because from your base worldwide, I already know that there are a few existing green shipping corridors in operation, and there are a few being planned. I very much hope that Hong Kong will be able to participate in some of those, if not all. If Hong Kong can lead discussions on creating a new ones, perhaps in this part of the region, we can actively participate and contribute. For the very first step, we have also announced the signing of the first batch of partner ports. This paved our way to put Hong Kong in a more high-profile position, so that we can attract more sisters and brothers to build a greater alliance. This initiative will definitely drive us to upgrade our infrastructure and enhance green maritime fuel bunkering capabilities, with the ultimate goal of creating truly net-zero emission shipping lanes. We will have some exciting updates on this front next year, particularly on our move towards creating or joining the green shipping corridors. It is not just an upward or a high profile publicising move, but actually I would like to use this to drive inward, back home. The effort towards building a green port is very important to push our ship operators or container terminal operators to invest and expedite their action. The IBIA Secretariat will know that there needs to be a lot of participation and influence, especially on the operators because they have to really invest billions and trillions of money. They will need to know the long-term future and long-term bright spot on that. But in the meantime, they will definitely need to make some tough decisions right in the short term for investments. With Hong Kong putting our footprint on the worldwide green transformation path, I would like to use this as a triggering point to enable our operators and industry players to join, participate and act.

  Closer to home, we are forging partnerships with stakeholders from both Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland. I think one of the points that the IBIA comes to Hong Kong is that you would like to run Hong Kong as a platform and you can get more knowledge about what is happening in the Chinese Mainland. In particular, we have set up some platforms and communication channels to focus squarely on fuel supply and trading with the Chinese Mainland. A powerful example of this collaboration was this June, when we signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with four green maritime fuel suppliers and bunker operators. This took place at a groundbreaking event - the first ever Mainland-Hong Kong green energy business matchmaking event organised under the auspices of the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government. It is actually motivated and rooted between the Ministry of Commerce and my bureau. We hosted that matchmaking event in a dual mode. It was hosted both in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. We witnessed the signing of the MOU online and in parallel mode, thanks to all the digital technological backup. With over 300 industry representatives participating, the event was a clear sign of our shared commitment to building a thriving ecosystem for maritime fuel bunkering and trading. But we didn't stop there, we established a communication platform that encompasses companies registered and doing business in Hong Kong from across the entire maritime fuel bunkering supply chain, with a view to facilitating business discussion and collecting views from the trade on ways to bolster our competitiveness in green maritime fuel bunkering and trading. We warmly welcome all interested Hong Kong companies to join the communication platform. For all those from abroad, we welcome you to have branches or headquarters in Hong Kong, and we also welcome them to join this communication platform which we will be announcing soon, so stay tuned. Together, we can firmly put Hong Kong on the map as a premier green maritime fuel bunkering hub in the region, as well as a green maritime fuel trading centre that acts as the gateway for export and trading of Mainland-produced green maritime fuels.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the transition towards green maritime fuels is an irreversible trend for the maritime industry and this is what we have mentioned. This isn't a choice or an option; it's an imperative. And Hong Kong is all in. To navigate this change, we need forums like this. The IBIA has the right decision to have this spot right in this year's Hong Kong Maritime Week. I am sure you have helped drive some of our 18 000-plus participants this year, which is a record high. Today is about preparing for that future. The conversations in this room will equip us with the crucial steps we need very much to take, together and ahead. My thank to the IBIA for bringing us all together today, I encourage all participants this morning to make best of this event, learn more about the opportunities here in Hong Kong and also worldwide in different countries, different ports. We are all very passionate, notwithstanding the International Maritime Organization's agenda, and we hope that we can explore how we, together, can be a part of that exciting green journey.

  I wish you all a very fruitful event and a pleasant stay in Hong Kong. Thank you very much."

Special traffic and transport arrangements for Hong Kong Streetathon 2025 this Sunday,2025-11-19 12:11,2025-11-19 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111800621.htm,"The Transport Department (TD) today (November 19) reminded members of the public that temporary special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented in phases at various locations on Hong Kong Island North and in Kowloon East and Tseung Kwan O from 1am this Sunday (November 23) to facilitate the holding of the Hong Kong Streetathon 2025.

 The full marathon race will start at the Island Eastern Corridor (IEC) near Hing Fat Street and route through major road sections, including the IEC, the Central-Wan Chai Bypass, and Lung Wo Road, then turn back and be routed through the Eastern Harbour Crossing and the Tseung Lam Highway, and then turn back again and be routed via Cha Kwo Ling Road, Kwun Tong Bypass, Hoi Bun Road and Kai Fuk Road to the finishing point at the Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section) near Yau Ma Tei Interchange.

 The race route of the half marathon race will be similar to that of the full marathon race, except that it will not be routed through the Central-Wan Chai Bypass, Lung Wo Road and the Tseung Lam Highway.

 The 10-kilometre race will start at the Tseung Lam Highway near Tong Yin Street and route through the Tseung Lam Highway, Cha Kwo Ling Road, Kwun Tong Bypass and Hoi Bun Road to the finishing point at Kwun Tong Promenade.

 Subject to the race arrangements and progress, the road sections along the race routes will be temporarily closed in phases from 1am on that day, until the reopening of roads at about 1pm. Motorists are advised to pay attention to the traffic signs erected at the scene and consider using alternative routes to their destinations.

 Due to the temporary road closures, the TD anticipates that traffic at various locations on Hong Kong Island and in Kowloon and the New Territories will be significantly more congested compared to normal Sundays, including:


Hong Kong Island: King's Road, Java Road, Shau Kei Wan Road, Causeway Road, Victoria Park Road, Yee Wo Street, Gloucester Road, Hennessy Road, Connaught Road Central, Harcourt Road, Queensway, the Aberdeen Tunnel (Wan Chai bound) and the vicinity of Central Ferry Pier areas;
Kowloon: Kwun Tong Road, Wai Yip Street, Prince Edward Road East and the vicinity of Kowloon Bay areas; and
New Territories: The Tseung Kwan O Tunnel (Kowloon bound).


 Motorists are advised to avoid driving to the above affected areas. In case of traffic congestion, motorists should exercise patience, drive with care, and follow the instructions of the Police on-site.

 In view of the temporary road closures, 56 bus routes (including 14 KMB routes, 22 Citybus routes and 20 Cross Harbour Bus routes) and 15 Green Minibus routes will be affected and subject to diversion, truncation or relocation of stops in phases until the reopening of the roads. During the road closure period, taxi stands (including taxi pick-up/drop-off points), public light bus stands, roadside parking spaces and private car parks on the affected roads will be suspended.

 To enable participants travelling to Causeway Bay for the full and half marathon races, which have the earliest starting times of 5.15am and 5.55am respectively, the first departures of all MTR rail lines (except the Airport Express and Disneyland Resort Line) will be suitably advanced on Sunday, with the first departures on the Tuen Ma Line and East Rail Line to be operated at 2.50am. In addition, one special bus route will also be operated to serve event participants travelling to Causeway Bay this Sunday.

 Members of the public should plan their journeys early to avoid unexpected delays and use public transport services (particularly railway services) as far as possible, paying attention to the arrangements of temporary route diversions and relocations of stops. They may browse the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk) or mobile application ""HKeMobility"" for information about special traffic and transport information, or they may also browse relevant public transport operators' websites or mobile applications for details of service changes.

 The TD and the Police will closely monitor the traffic situation. Other temporary road and traffic control measures, including adjusting the extent of road closures and altering or suspending public transport services, may be implemented by the Police at short notice depending on the actual traffic conditions. Members of the public are advised to stay alert to the latest traffic news."

"Property owner fined over $800,000 for not complying with removal orders",2025-11-19 11:00,2025-11-19 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900219.htm,"âAn owner was convicted and fined $806,000 in total, of which $182,000 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts yesterday (November 18) for failing to comply with removal orders issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123).

The case involved an unauthorised structure with an area of about 6 000 square metres across 13 sections of a lot in D.D. 52, Fu Tei Au, North District. Since the Lands Department would not issue a certificate of exemption for the unauthorised building works (UBWs) and the UBWs were also carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), 13 removal orders were served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal orders, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (November 19), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

有關個䅁涉及一個位於橫跨北區虎地坳丈量約份第52約地段其中十三個分段的違例搭建物，面積約6 000平方米。由於有關僭建物不會獲地政總署發出豁免證明書，亦並無事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，屋宇署根據《建築物條例》第24（1）條向業主發出13張清拆令。該業主沒有履行清拆令，故遭屋宇署檢控。

屋宇署發言人今日（十一月十九日）說：「僭建物可導致嚴重後果。業主必須盡快遵從清拆令。對於未有遵從清拆令的業主，屋宇署會繼續採取執法行動，包括提出檢控，以保障樓宇及公眾安全。」

根據《建築物條例》，任何人無合理辯解而沒有遵從清拆令是嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可處罰款200,000元及監禁一年，及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款最高20,000元。"

徐浩光博士說：「環保署持續完善廚餘回收網絡，並加強宣傳教育，推動更多市民參與廚餘回收。現時已有超過1 500個設於公共屋邨、私人屋苑等地點的家居廚餘回收設施。環保署去年更策略性地在全港各區逐步設立約250個公眾廚餘回收點，當中在夜間營運的『廚餘回收流動點』，更可為繁忙都市中的居民提供便捷的廚餘回收途徑。在最新推出的『廚餘回收車試驗計劃』下，回收車每晚走訪不同地點推廣廚餘回收，並讓市民認識和體驗廚餘回收。我們希望藉此便利市民，鼓勵更多市民實踐綠色生活。」

「廚餘回收車試驗計劃」上月率先在中西區試行，回收車每晚六時三十分至十時三十分，走訪區內四個指定地點，向市民推廣源頭分類及正確回收廚餘的方法，並為市民提供便利的廚餘回收途徑。四個服務地點包括：

1. 半山區麥當勞道（近聚安樓）：晚上六時三十分至七時十五分
2. 西營盤港鐵站C出口外停車處：晚上七時四十分至八時二十五分
3. 堅尼地城堅彌地城海旁（近明珠閣）：晚上八時四十五分至九時三十分
4. 堅尼地城堅彌地城新海旁（近嘉安大廈）：晚上九時四十五分至十時三十分

計及「廚餘回收車試驗計劃」，全港在夜間營運的「廚餘回收流動點」已達至104個（見附件），每日在晚間時分於貼近民居或食肆地點定時定點運作，方便附近居民及食肆在晚間處理廚餘，養成廚餘回收的習慣。

透過推行各種措施，廚餘回收量近年持續上升。整體廚餘回收量已達至每日340公噸，較二○二三年增長一倍，當中家居廚餘回收量由二○二三年每日七公噸大幅增至現時約130公噸。

徐浩光博士和鄭健向在場市民介紹「廚餘回收車試驗計劃」，聽取他們對環保署回收服務的意見，並向市民宣傳十二月七日舉行的立法會選舉。

They took the opportunity to call on the public to cast their votes in the Legislative Council (LegCo) General Election on December 7.

Dr Chui said, ""The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has been continuously enhancing the food waste recycling network, and strengthening publicity and education to encourage more people to participate in food waste recycling. Currently, there are more than 1 500 food waste recycling facilities set up in premises including public rental housing estates and private residential estates. Since last year, the EPD has been strategically setting up around 250 public food waste recycling points across all districts. Among these, the Food Waste Recycling Spots that operate at night time provide busy citizens with convenient recycling outlets for food waste. Under the newly launched Trial Scheme, a recycling truck visits various locations every evening to promote food waste recycling, allowing members of the public to learn about and experience food waste recycling for themselves. We hope this make it convenient for people to practise green living.""

The Trial Scheme was rolled out first in Central and Western District last month. A food waste recycling truck operates from 6.30pm to 10.30pm every night, visiting four designated locations in the district to promote waste separation at source and proper ways of food waste recycling, and provide a convenient outlet for the public to recycle food waste. The four designated locations are:


MacDonnell Road, Mid-levels (near Silvercrest): 6.30pm to 7.15pm
Parking Area outside Exit C of Sai Ying Pun MTR Station: 7.40pm to 8.25pm
Praya Kennedy Town,Kennedy Town (near Brilliant Court): 8.45pm to 9.30pm
New Praya Kennedy Town,Kennedy Town (near Ka On Building): 9.45pm to 10.30pm


Including the Trial Scheme, the number of night-time Food Waste Recycling Spots has reached 104 (see annex). Operating at fixed times and locations during evening hours close to residential and dining areas, these recycling points facilitate nearby residents and eateries to dispose of food waste at night and develop recycling habits.

Through the implementation of various measures, the amount of food waste recycled has been on the rise in recent years. The overall food waste recycled has reached 340 tonnes per day, doubling the figure of 2023. In particular, the amount of domestic food waste recycled significantly increased from 7 tonnes per day in 2023 to about 130 tonnes per day currently.

Dr Chui and Mr Cheng introduced the Trial Scheme to the residents on-site and listened to their feedback on the EPD's recycling services. They also called on the public to support the LegCo General Election on December 7.

Dr Chui said, ""I urge everyone to exercise their civic responsibilities with their families by casting their votes on December 7. Let’s elect outstanding individuals with an affection for the country and Hong Kong to contribute to the future development of the city."""

HKSAR Government strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission report,2025-11-19 04:32,2025-11-19 05:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900087.htm,"  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government today (November 19) strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects the groundless attacks, slanders and smears against various aspects of the situation of the HKSAR including safeguarding national security, protecting human rights and business environmentin the so-called ""2025 report"" issued by the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC).

  The HKSAR Government spokesman stressed, ""The HKSAR Government strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects USCC's wanton manoeuvre with politics prevailing over law-based administration and interference in the affairs of the HKSAR in the so-called report. The HKSAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China, is a local administrative region that enjoys a high degree of autonomy under 'one country, two systems',and comes directly under the Central People's Government. The legal basis for implementing 'one country, two systems' comprises the Constitution and the Basic Law, which provide constitutional guarantee for fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to equality before the law, and is buttressed by the rule of law and independent judicial power.""

  ""The HKSAR steadfastly safeguards national sovereignty, security and development interests, and fully and faithfully lives up to this top priority of the 'one country, two systems' principle. The HKSAR Government will resolutely, fully and faithfully continue to implement the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL), the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) and other relevant laws so as to prevent, suppress and impose punishment on acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law. At the same time, it will safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people, ensuring the steadfast and successful implementation of 'one country, two systems'. The HKSAR Government strongly urges the US to discern facts from fallacies, respect the international law and basic norms governing international relations, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs.""

Laws Safeguarding National Security

  The spokesman stressed, ""Endangering national security is a very serious offence. No country will watch with folded arms on acts and activities that endanger national security. In terms of legislation relating to safeguarding national security, the US has at least 21 pieces. There have also been countless administrative orders issued in the name of so-called 'national security'. However, the relevant commission exposed their double standards as they pointed fingers at the HKSAR's legal system and enforcement mechanisms to safeguard national security, while totally disregarded the constitutional duty and practical needs of the HKSAR to legislate and continuously enhance relevant laws, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the relevant national security legislation on economic development and the protection of human rights.""

  ""In fact, the implementation of the HKNSL in the past five years or so has enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community at large to swiftly resume to normal and the business environment to be restored and improved continuously. With the support from all sectors of the community, the SNSO was unanimously passed by the Legislative Council, and took effect upon gazettal on March 23, 2024, thereby further improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms of the HKSAR for safeguarding national security. According to the Economic Freedom of the World 2025 Annual Report, Hong Kong has once again been ranked as the world's freest economy. Hong Kong's ranking improved by two places to third globally in the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025. Also, Hong Kong continues to rank among the top three international financial centres and comes first in the world in terms of funds raised through initial public offerings in the first three quarters of 2025. Hong Kong ranks the 24th out of 142 countries and jurisdictions globally in the 2025 World Justice Project Rule of Law Index. Its overall score (0.72) remained unchanged, matching the scores of the countries ranked 22nd and 23rd. Hong Kong remains high in the overall ranking and continues to be ahead of some European and American countries, including the US, which often unreasonably criticise the rule of law and human rights situation of Hong Kong. These internationally recognised achievements are built upon the freedom and stability brought to the Hong Kong society by the HKNSL, other relevant laws of the HKSAR, and the work of safeguarding national security.""

  ""As a matter of fact, the HKNSL and SNSO clearly define the elements of relevant offences, penalties, exceptions and defences. These laws actively prevent, suppress and punish acts and activities endangering national security, in accordance with the principle of the rule of law. They target an extremely small minority of individuals and organisations that pose a threat to national security, while protecting the lives and property of the general public and their legitimate rights and interests. Law-abiding persons will not unwittingly violate the law.""

  ""The HKSAR has the constitutional responsibility to continue to improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security. The purpose of the subsidiary legislation made under the SNSO in May 2025 is to better carry into effect the provisions of the HKNSL concerning the mandate of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (OSNS). The subsidiary legislation does not grant the OSNS any new power, and will not affect the lives of ordinary citizens or the normal operation of institutions or organisations.""

  ""Extraterritorial effect for offences under the HKNSL and the SNSO fully aligns with the principles of international law, international practice and common practice adopted in various countries and regions. It is both necessary and legitimate, and is also in line with those of other countries and regions around the world. As the law enforcement department of the HKSAR safeguarding national security, the Hong Kong Police Force are duty-bound to pursue the liability of those who have allegedly endangered national security outside Hong Kong. Those absconders hiding outside Hong Kong are wanted because they continue to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security and wantonly collude with external forces to cover for their evil deeds. It is necessary for the HKSAR Government to take all lawful measures. The specification of absconders in respect of offences endangering national security and specification of measures applicable against the relevant absconders under the SNSO aim to address, combat, deter and prevent acts of abscondment, and procure the return of absconders to Hong Kong to face law enforcement and judicial proceedings. Such actions are fully justified, necessary and legitimate. In fact, quite a number of countries including the US would also impose such measures on wanted criminals. The US's abuse of long-arm jurisdiction and indiscriminate use of so-called sanctions are the real form of 'transnational repression'.""

  ""The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, paying no regard to their political stance, background or occupation of the person or organisation involved. The HKSAR Government has repeatedly emphasised that the suggestion that any persons or organisations with certain backgrounds should be immune from legal sanctions for their illegal acts and activities is tantamount to granting such persons privileges to break the law and is totally contrary to the spirit of the rule of law. External forces continue to distort the truth, blatantly discredit the judicial system and trials of the HKSAR, in an attempt to glorify criminal behavior and exert pressure on the courts of the HKSAR. The HKSAR Government strongly urges the Committee to respect fundamental principles such as the spirit of the rule of law and judicial independence, and to immediately cease these despicable actions.""

Safeguarding Due Administration of Justice and Rule of Law

  ""The HKSAR Government emphasised that all judicial cases are handled strictly on the basis of evidence and in accordance with the law. All defendants will receive fair trial strictly in accordance with laws applicable to Hong Kong (including the HKNSL and the SNSO) and as protected by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. The so-called report specifically mentioned cases on offences endangering national security involving Wong Chi-fung and Lai Chee-ying, wantonly smearing the law enforcement, prosecution and judicial organs of the HKSAR regarding the handling of the relevant cases. Their ulterior motives are obvious, namely, to interfere with the judicial proceedings in the HKSAR by means of political power in order to procure a defendant's evasion of the criminal justice process. The HKSAR Government strongly condemned these blatant attempting to undermine the rule of law of the HKSAR.""

  The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""The HKSAR Government safeguards independent judicial power and fully supports the Judiciary in exercising its judicial power independently, safeguarding the due administration of justice and the rule of law. Articles 2, 19 and 85 of the Basic Law specifically provide that the HKSAR enjoys independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication, and the courts of the HKSAR shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference. The legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR will absolutely not undermine the independent judicial power. When handling cases involving offences endangering national security, judges, as in all other cases, perform their judicial duties independently and impartially, without any interference. The HKSAR Government supports the Judiciary to continue to seek suitable candidates, both locally and overseas, to serve as non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal, and to handle such judicial appointments in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance. The presence or absence of individual non-permanent judges have no impact on the integrity of the judicial system. In fact, many non-permanent judges have expressed confidence in the independence of the judicial officers of the HKSAR when they left office.""

  ""The Department of Justice, by virtue of Article 63 of the Basic Law, controls criminal prosecutions, makes independent prosecutorial decisions in accordance with the law, free from any interference. Prosecutions would be instituted by the Department of Justice only if there is sufficient admissible evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction, and if it is in the public interest to do so.""

  ""The Judiciary of the HKSAR exercises judicial power independently in accordance with the law, and everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to a fair hearing. All cases concerning offence endangering national security will be handled by the prosecution and judicial authorities of the HKSAR in a fair and timely manner in strict compliance with Article 42(1) of the HKNSL, with the procedural rights of defendants exercised in accordance with the law fully respected throughout the process. The courts decide cases strictly in accordance with the evidence and all applicable laws, and cases will never be handled any differently owing to the profession, political beliefs or background of the persons involved. The prosecution has the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission of an offence before a defendant may be convicted by the court.""

  ""The so-called 'report' threatened again to impose 'sanctions' on the HKSAR, attempting to use political power to deter relevant personnel in the HKSAR from discharging their responsibilities to safeguard national security, interfering in the law enforcement and judicial process of the HKSAR. All these are reprehensible acts undermining the rule of law of the HKSAR, which the HKSAR Government strongly condemns. All relevant personnel in the HKSAR will not be intimidated and will continue to resolutely discharge the responsibility of safeguarding national security.""

Anti-Money Laundering and Enforcement of Sanctions

  The HKSAR Government spokesman continued, ""It is high on the HKSAR Government's agenda to maintain the integrity and robustness of our financial systems. Our banks and other financial institutions strictly adhere to international standards and best practices, including those on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). Hong Kong has been recognised by the Financial Action Task Force, the international standard-setter on AML/CFT, to be overall compliant with the relevant international standards, with a robust legal framework and effective system, especially in the identification and understanding of risks, law enforcement, asset recovery and international co-operation.""

  The HKSAR Government spokesman said, ""The HKSAR Government has been enforcing the sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) fully and vigorously to fulfil our international obligations. We do not implement unilateral sanctions imposed by other countries that constitute a flagrant violation of the international order based on international law and the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The HKSARG has long been maintaining an effective mechanism for implementing the resolutions of the UNSC. That includes denying entry of vessels designated by the UNSC as well as suspicious vessels, keeping a close watch on and inspecting suspicious Hong Kong-based companies to prevent them from participating in activities evading UNSC sanctions, and participating in the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Arms Trade Treaty through the Central People's Government. The effectiveness of our work has been well respected and recognised by our trading partners.""

SafeguardingRights andFreedoms

  The HKSAR Government spokesman said, ""The HKSAR Government steadfastly safeguards the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people as protected under the law. Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, human rights in the city have always been robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. The HKNSL and the SNSO also clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and that the rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, shall be protected in accordance with the law. Nonetheless, just as the case with other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. The ICCPR also expressly states that some of them may be subject to restrictions as prescribed by law that are necessary for protection of national security, public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms of others, etc. Indeed, Article 19 of the ICCPR specifically requires that journalists must observe and discharge 'special duties and responsibilities' including protection of national security or public order.""

  ""In fact, since the implementation of the HKNSL and the SNSO, the media landscape in Hong Kong has remained vibrant. However, some people with ulterior motives deliberately fabricated facts about freedom of the press and speech in Hong Kong. Like all other places in the world, freedom of the press and speech are not absolute. The media, like everyone else, has an obligation to abide by all the laws. The media continue to enjoy the freedom to comment on and criticise government policies without any restriction, as long as this is not in violation of the law. The court further cited precedents from the European Court of Human Rights regarding press freedom in the reasons for verdict of a relevant case, pointing out that the European Convention on Human Rights does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of speech even with respect to press coverage on matters of serious public concern. The most crucial point is that journalists must act in good faith and on accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism' in order to enjoy the protection of their rights to freedom of speech and press freedom.""

Maintaining long-term prosperity and stability

ããThe spokesmanreiterated, ""Under 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong has the distinctive advantageof enjoying strong support of the motherland while being closely connected to the world. With such unparalleled connectivity, Hong Kong will continue to play its dual role as ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"". Hong Kong will also continue to leverage its strengths to enhance its role as international financial, maritime and trade centres, among others, whilst proactively integrating into the overall development of our nation, including the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, the high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative, etc.. The HKSAR Government will continue to identify new areas for economic development and proactively compete for enterprises and talents with a view to promoting the sustainable development and enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong. As a matter of fact, Hong Kong has once again been ranked as the world’s freest economy by the Fraser Institute. On the other hand, the US enjoys significant economic benefits in Hong Kong and has realised a trade surplus of more than US$270 billion with Hong Kong over the past 10 years, the largest among US global trading partners. There are about 1 390 US companies with their businesses in Hong Kong. All these demonstrate the close and long-standing economic ties between Hong Kong and the US, as well as the vast business interests of the US in Hong Kong. A stable and prosperous Hong Kong is certainly of mutual benefits to Hong Kong and the US."""

「香港特區堅決維護國家主權、安全和發展利益，全面準確貫徹『一國兩制』方針的最高原則。特區政府會繼續堅定不移全面準確實施《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》和其他相關法律，依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，同時保障香港市民的權利和自由，確保『一國兩制』實踐行穩致遠。特區政府再次強烈敦促美國認清事實，遵從國際法和國際關係的基本準則，立即停止干涉純屬中國內政的香港事務。」

維護國家安全相關法律

發言人強調：「危害國家安全是嚴重的罪行，沒有國家會對危害國家安全的行為和活動袖手旁觀。在維護國家安全方面的法律，美國就最少有21部，而以所謂『國家安全』為名義簽發的行政命令更不計其數。有關委員會卻對香港特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制指手畫腳，全然漠視香港特區訂立及持續優化相關法律的憲制責任和實際需要，以及在維護國家安全的相關法律訂立後，對經濟發展和人權保障所帶來的正面效果，是實實在在的雙重標準。」

「事實是，《香港國安法》實施五年多以來，讓廣大香港市民生活和經濟活動迅速回復正常，營商環境得以恢復並不斷提升。《維護國家安全條例》在香港社會各界廣泛支持下，獲立法會全票通過，並於二○二四年三月二十三日刊憲生效後，使特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制進一步得以完善。根據《世界經濟自由度2025年度報告》，香港繼續獲評為全球最自由經濟體；香港在《2025年世界競爭力年報》的排名躍升兩位至全球第三；香港在全球國際金融中心中位列三甲，並在今年首三季首次公開招股集資額位居全球首位；香港在《2025年法治指數》的排名在全球142個國家和地區中位列24，整體分數（0.72）不變，與排名22和23的國家相同，整體排名維持高位，並繼續領先於包括美國在內一些不時無理批評香港法治和人權狀況的歐美國家。這些國際認可的成就都是建基於《香港國安法》及其他特區相關法律和維護國家安全工作為香港社會帶來的自由、安穩。」

「事實上，《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》清楚訂明構成有關罪行的元素和刑罰、例外情況和免責辯護，按法治原則堅持積極防範，依法制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，只針對極少數危害國家安全的個人和組織，保障廣大市民的人身和財產安全以及合法權益。奉公守法的人不會誤墮法網。」

「香港特區有憲制責任持續完善維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制。2025年5月根據《維護國家安全條例》訂立的附屬法例，目的是為了更有效實施《香港國安法》關乎中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全公署（公署）職責的條文。附屬法例並不會賦予公署任何新的權力，亦不會影響一般市民的生活，以及機構或組織的正常運作。」

「《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》下的罪行訂有適當的域外效力，完全符合國際法原則、國際慣例和各國各地區通行做法，實屬必要和正當，並與世界其他國家和地區一致。香港警務處作為特區維護國家安全的執法部門，有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌危害國家安全的惡行。該等一直潛藏境外的潛逃者被通緝，是因為他們在當地繼續公然從事危害國家安全的勾當，肆意勾結外部勢力包庇其惡行。特區政府採取一切合法措施，根據《維護國家安全條例》指明危害國家安全罪行的潛逃者及指明針對有關潛逃者施行的措施，目的是應對、打擊、阻嚇和防止潛逃行為，以及促使有關潛逃者回港接受執法和司法程序，做法有理有據，實屬必要和正當。事實上，包括美國等不少國家也會就不同的通緝犯施行措施打擊潛逃行為。美方濫施長臂管轄、亂揮『制裁』大棒，才是真正的『跨境鎮壓』。」

「香港特區執法部門一直根據證據、嚴格依照法律，以及按有關人士或單位的行為而採取執法行動，與涉事人士或組織的政治立場、背景或職業無關。特區政府已多次強調，倡議某種背景的人或組織不應就其違法行為和活動受到法律制裁，等同給予其犯法特權，完全違反法治精神。外部勢力顛倒是非、公然抹黑香港特區的司法制度和審訊，企圖美化犯罪行為，特區政府強烈敦促委員會，尊重法治精神和司法獨立等基本準則，立即停止上述卑劣行為。」

維護司法公正和法治精神

「特區政府強調所有司法案件均是嚴格根據證據和依照法律處理。所有被告均嚴格按照香港適用法律（包括《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》），並在《基本法》及《香港人權法案》的保障下接受公平審訊。所謂『報告』中特別提及到黃之鋒及黎智英所涉的危害國家安全犯罪案件，肆意就有關案件的辦理抹黑香港特區的執法、檢控和司法機關，其目的昭然若揭，就是企圖利用政治力量干預香港特區司法程序，以促使任何被告人不能獲得應有公平審訊。特區政府對這些妄圖破壞香港特區法治的行為，予以強烈譴責。」

發言人續指出：「特區政府維護獨立的司法權，全力支持司法機構依法獨立行使審判權，維護司法公正和法治精神。《基本法》第二條、第十九條及第八十五條訂明，香港特區享有獨立的司法權和終審權，法院獨立進行審判，不受任何干涉。香港特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制絕對沒有損害獨立司法權。法官在處理危害國家安全犯罪案件時，一如其他案件，都是獨立公正地履行司法職責，不受任何干涉。特區政府支持司法機構繼續物色本地及海外的合適人選出任終審法院非常任法官，並按《基本法》及《香港終審法院條例》相關規定處理有關司法任命。個別非常任法官的去留，絕無影響香港特區司法制度的基礎。事實上，不少非常任法官離任時，均表示對香港特區司法人員的獨立性有信心。」

「律政司按《基本法》第六十三條主管刑事檢控工作，依法獨立作出檢控決定，不受任何干涉，律政司在有充分證據令案件有合理機會達致定罪，以及在合乎公眾利益的情況下，才會提出起訴。」

「香港特區司法機關依法獨立行使審判權，而所有面對刑事指控的人都享有接受公平審訊的權利。檢控機關和司法機關嚴格履行《香港國安法》第四十二條第一款的責任，確保所有危害國家安全犯罪案件得到公正、及時辦理，過程中充分尊重被告人依法行使各項程序權利。法院嚴格按照證據和所有適用法律判案，案件不會因涉案者的職業、政治理念或背景而在處理上有所不同。控方亦有責任在毫無合理疑點下證明被告人犯罪，被告人才可被法庭定罪。」

「美方所謂『報告』又再威嚇對香港特區實施所謂『制裁』，企圖利用政治力量阻嚇香港特區相關人員履行維護國家安全職責，肆意干預香港特區的執法和司法程序，這些都是破壞法治的行為，特區政府予以強烈譴責。香港特區相關人員無懼任何恫嚇，定當繼續堅定不移履行維護國家安全的責任。」

打擊洗錢和執行制裁

發言人又指出︰「特區政府高度重視維護金融體系的誠信及穩健。本港銀行和其他金融機構均嚴格遵守包括打擊洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集的國際標準和最佳做法。專責制訂打擊洗錢和恐怖分子資金籌集國際標準的財務行動特別組織已確認香港整體，尤其在識別及了解風險、執法、追討資產及國際合作等方面符合相關國際標準，並擁有健全的法律架構及有效的制度。」

發言人續指出︰「特區政府一直全面及嚴格執行聯合國安全理事會（安理會）施加的制裁，以履行國際義務。我們不會執行其他國家施加的單邊制裁。這些制裁違反以國際法為基礎的國際秩序，和以《聯合國憲章》宗旨和原則為基礎的國際關係基本準則。特區政府通過有效的機制執行聯合國安理會的決議，包括拒絕聯合國安理會指定及可疑的船隻進入香港；監察和巡查可疑的香港公司，防止其參與規避聯合國制裁的活動；以及通過中央人民政府參與《化學武器公約》及《武器貿易條約》。我們的工作成效，一直獲得各貿易夥伴的尊重和認同。」

保障權利和自由

發言人表示：「特區政府堅定維護香港市民受到法律保障的權利和自由。自香港回歸祖國以來，人權一直受到《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實憲制保障。《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》亦清楚訂明香港特區維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》、《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港，有關言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會、遊行、示威的權利和自由。然而，和世界其他地方一樣，有關權利和自由並非絕對，《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》亦清楚訂明，在有必要保障國家安全、公共安全、公共秩序或他人的權利和自由等情況下，可以依法限制部分權利和自由。《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》第十九條更清楚指出，新聞從業員必須遵守及執行『特別責任和義務』，包括保障國家安全或公共秩序。」

「事實上，自《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》實施以來，本港的傳媒環境蓬勃依然。惟部分別有用心人士卻刻意捏造有關香港新聞和言論自由的事實。與世界其他地方一樣，新聞和言論自由並非絕對，傳媒與其他人一樣都有義務遵守所有法律。只要不違法，傳媒繼續享有評論和批評政府施政的自由，全然不受限制。法庭在相關案件的裁決理由也引用了歐洲人權法院關於新聞自由的判例，指出即使是報道涉及備受公眾關注的重要議題，在《歐洲人權公約》下也不享有完全不受限制的言論自由；最重要的一點是，新聞工作者必須按『負責任新聞作業』原則真誠地行事，以準確事實為基礎，並提供準確可靠的資訊，方可獲言論和新聞自由權利保障。」

保持長期繁榮穩定

發言人重申：「在『一國兩制』下，香港擁有『背靠祖國、聯通世界』此得天獨厚的顯著優勢，並會藉此繼續發揮其作為『超級連繫人』和『超級增值人』的雙角色。香港亦會繼續發揮其優勢以鞏固國際金融、航運和貿易中心等地位，以及積極融入國家發展大局包括參與粵港澳大灣區建設、『一帶一路』高質量發展等。特區政府會繼續發掘經濟發展新領域，及更積極進取地招商引才，以促進香港的持續發展及提升其競爭力。事實上，香港繼續獲菲沙研究所評定為全球最自由經濟體。另一方面，美國在港享有重大的經濟利益，美國對香港的貿易順差過去10年超過2 700億美元，是其全球貿易夥伴中最高，並有約1 390家美國公司在港設有業務。這些數字顯示香港跟美國兩地有密切而長遠的經濟往來，而美國企業在香港擁有龐大的商業利益。香港的繁榮穩定必定對香港與美國互惠互利。」"

Executive Director of OASES visits Shanghai to foster I&T exchanges and encourage strategic enterprises' expansion in Hong Kong (with photos),2025-11-18 23:24,2025-11-18 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800897.htm,"The Executive Director of the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES), Mr Bryan Peng, and his team conducted a duty visit to Shanghai from November 17 to 18. During the visit, the OASES team engaged in in-depth discussions with leading and representative companies in the life and health technology sector. Their focus was on exploring diverse business development opportunities in Hong Kong and promoting the establishment of Hong Kong as a hub for health and medical innovation.

The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address clearly emphasises the importance of industry development and reform. Regarding the life and health technology industry, a key highlight is the establishment of the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation by the end of 2026. Complementing this initiative is the new drug approval mechanism (""1+"" mechanism) which facilitates pharmaceutical companies in accelerating the market launch of innovative drugs. Such policies provide strong support for companies to expand their businesses in Hong Kong and demonstrate the Government's commitment to becoming an international hub for health and medical innovation.

During the visit, Mr Peng and his team visited a pharmaceutical company ranked among the top ten in China's pharmaceutical industry. The company has established 6 R&D centres worldwide and 11 manufacturing sites. In discussions with the company's management, they shared a series of policies aimed at promoting Hong Kong as an international hub for health and medical innovation, including the establishment of the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute which supports both local and international pharmaceutical research institutions and co-ordinates multi-centre clinical trials with cross-border research transformation, ensuring that these trials meet both national and international standards. The company's management recognised Hong Kong's unique advantages, including its high level of internationalisation and expertise in medical and research fields. They expressed their commitment to closely collaborate with OASES, actively utilising Hong Kong as a platform to advance their international innovation and R&D initiatives.

Subsequently, the team met with the management of a pharmaceutical company ranked among the top 50 globally and listed in Hong Kong. The company operates the largest research and production base for anti-tumour and surgical drugs in Chinese Mainland and is recognised as a highly innovative large-scale pharmaceutical company. The management expressed that the ""1+"" mechanism provides essential policy support for their products entering the Hong Kong market and affirmed the Government's investment and determination in the innovation and technology sector. Both parties agreed that Hong Kong, with its abundant high-end talent and international network, has become an important bridgehead for companies looking to expand globally. They also reached a consensus on advancing co-operation, including the establishment of overseas headquarter, research centre, corporate treasury centre, and drug registrations in Hong Kong.

The team also visited the Shanghai branch of an international pharmaceutical multinational cooperation, where the OASES team was invited to participate in their ""Expert Talk"" event, engaging with teams and research management experts from various regions worldwide. During the event, Mr Peng and the Chief Manager (Life and Health Technology) of the OASES,Dr Maggie Lo,provided a detailed introduction on Hong Kong's innovation and technology policies and dedicated support schemes in the life and health technology sector. This presentation generated widespread interest among the participating experts and company representatives. The OASES team will provide necessary support to relevant projects aimed at being implemented in Hong Kong.

Mr Peng remarked that the visit was highly fruitful. Through in-depth communication with industry leaders and representative companies, they effectively helped the companies gain a better understanding of Hong Kong's latest policies and provided critical insights for those looking to expand their global operations by leveraging Hong Kong's advantages as an innovation and technology hub. He emphasised that OASES is committed to attracting top international and Chinese Mainland pharmaceutical companies to establish operations in Hong Kong, in line with the key priorities outlined in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address. Looking ahead, OASES will continue to expand its efforts and assist leading innovation and technology enterprises worldwide to establish in Hong Kong, further promoting the long-term development of the innovation and technology industry in Hong Kong."
FEHD wins consecutive best public toilet awards,2025-11-18 22:17,2025-11-18 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800909.htm,"A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (November 18) that the department is delighted to have won consecutive gold and silver awards this year in the annual Hong Kong's Best Public Toilet Award organised by the Hong Kong Toilet Association.

Having won the gold award, the Lan Kwai Fong Public Toilet in Central and Western District is equipped with an air-conditioning system, facilities such as automatic sensor water taps and soap dispensers, and a touchless flush system. Toilet attendants provide round-the-clock service during weekends and public holidays. The Kam Tin Shi Public Toilet in Yuen Long District has won the silver award. With a simple and unpretentious appearance as well as a bright and hygienic interior design, the toilet is equipped with facilities including the three-in-one Cabinet Wash Hand Basin (combining automatic sensor water tap, soap dispenser and hand dryer), and a touchless flush system.

""In recent years, the FEHD has been enhancing the facilities, management and hygiene of public toilets (PTs), taking a multi-pronged approach and introducing new technologies to provide a better user experience for the public. We are delighted to learn that the PTs of the FEHD have won best toilet awards in consecutive years. This recognition is a testament to the department's hard work and dedication.""

The FEHD has earlier noted the ageing of facilities in Sai Ying Pun Market toilets and Kowloon City Road Public Toilet, and has already made facelifting and refurbishment plans. Among which, the toilet on the ground floor of Sai Ying Pun Market is scheduled to re-open within this month upon the completion of refurbishment works, while the works for the rest will commence in the coming months. Before the facelifting and refurbishment works are completed, the FEHD will enhance cleansing and collaborate with relevant departments to expedite the repair of damaged facilities.

The spokesman said, ""The FEHD will continue to enhance the hygiene and management of PTs under its purview, and improve the facilities and service quality of PTs through innovative ideas. We appeal to the public to maintain the cleanliness and hygiene of public facilities and help ensure that PTs are well cared for.""

The FEHD currently manages over 800 PTs. Since 2019-20, the FEHD and Architectural Services Department (ArchSD) have been proactively forging ahead with the Enhanced Public Toilet Refurbishment Programme. As of this September, full refurbishment or facelifting for about 480 PTs has been rolled out, with approximately 190 of these projects already completed. By planning ahead, streamlining or compressing preliminary work flows and adopting new construction methods and technologies, the FEHD and the ArchSD aim to commence full refurbishment or facelifting works for the remaining some 200 PTs across the territory by the end of 2028.

The FEHD employs technologies to enhance the service of PTs, including installing sensors in 15 PTs to monitor usage rates and environmental parameters in real time. When odour concentration is detected to have reached an alarming level, the system will immediately notify the responsible staff through an SMS message to arrange cleansing. Additionally, novel air purification technologies are utilised to catalytically decompose pollutants and to eliminate odour at source. Ozone generators are also deployed in individual PTs to convert the oxygen in the air to ozone, and through nanobubble technology, effectively oxidise the bacteria and viruses in water, preventing the formation of biofilms on toilet surfaces and reducing odours generated from excreta.

The FEHD has installed wireless broadcasting systems in approximately 200 PTs located at tourist attractions or with high utilisation rates across the territory to promote the importance of toilet cleanliness and proper use of facilities. Furthermore, public toilet cleansing services are gradually being separated from the street cleansing service contracts and procured independently under dedicated contracts. Provisions requiring toilet attendants to have received relevant vocational training with recognised qualifications are included in the new public toilet management service contracts with a view to upgrading the service standards."
Hong Kong hosts GBA Medical Products Administration Conference to accelerate medical products regulation and innovation development across GBA (with photos),2025-11-18 21:33,2025-11-18 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800836.htm,"âThe 2025 Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) Medical Products Administration Conferencewas convened in Hong Kong today (November 18). Representatives from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA)and the regulatory authorities ofGuangdong, Hong Kong and Macao exchanged views on enhancing the working mechanism for regulatory collaborations on drugs and medical devices in the GBA, and fostering the innovation development on regulating drugs and medical devices in the region.

 Under the guidance of the NMPA, the Conference was co-organised by the Department of Health (DH) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, the Guangdong Provincial Medical Products Administration, and the Pharmaceutical Administration Bureau of the Macao Special Administrative Region Government. Deputy Commissioner of the NMPA, Dr Yang Sheng, also attended the Conference.

 Addressing at the Conference, the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""The Recommendations of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee for Formulating the 15th FiveâYear Plan for Economic and Social Development, adopted at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the CPC, proposed to support the development of innovative drugs and medical devices, and to promote the inheritance and innovation of Chinese medicine and the integration of Chinese medicine and Western medicine. The HKSAR Government is fully committed to aligning with these key national strategies, leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages of enjoying strong support of the Motherland and being closely connected to the world under the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle to develop Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub and a bridgehead for Chinese medicine to go global, contributing to the high-quality development of the national pharmaceutical industry.""

  ""Through the establishment of 'one institute, one center' in the Hetao area (i.e. the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute in the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone and the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trials Center (GBAICTI) in the Shenzhen Park) and the formation of the 'GBA Clinical Trial Collaboration Platform', we are promoting international multi-centre clinical trials of innovative drugs and medical devices, gathering top-tier global research resources and accelerating the transformation of research and development outcomes. By 2026, the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation (CMPR) will be established, and the 'primary evaluation' for new drug registration will be implemented in phases, expediting the transformation of CMPR into an internationally recognised regulatory authority for medical products. These will strongly support the high-quality development of the national biopharmaceutical industry and jointly build the GBA into a world-class health and medical innovation hub. Regarding the development of Chinese medicine, we will announce the Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint outlining the way forward for the development of Chinese medicine in Hong Kong, and injecting new momentum for Chinese medicine to go global.""

 The Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, said, ""GBA serves as a leading region for medical products innovation nationwide. The medical products regulatory authorities of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have a significant responsibility. We not only safeguard public health of the people, but also drive scientific innovation with regulation and enhance the country's technological capabilities and international influence. This year marks the fifth anniversary of the release of the Work Plan for Regulatory Innovation and Development of Pharmaceutical and Medical Device in the GBA. There have been steady advancements in the innovative development of medical products regulation in the GBA, leading to fruitful achievements for Hong Kong in the field of medical products regulation, including the establishment of a real-time risk communication system, enhanced personnel and technical training, accelerated cross-boundary market access and circulation of high quality pharmaceutical and medical device products in the GBA, joint development of the standards of pharmaceutical products, and collaborative enforcement. These are some of the best examples of 'collaboration, innovation and mutual benefit' in the GBA.""

At the meeting, Dr Lam also reported on the HKSAR's achievements in promoting the GBA's collaborative strength in pharmaceutical regulation. These achievements included hosting the first International Medical Device Regulatory Forum and the global ""2025 Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S) Seminar"" in Hong Kong. Under the ""special measure of using Hong Kong registered drugs and medical devices used in Hong Kong public hospitals in GBA"", 61 drugs and 73 medical devices have been allowed to be used in the 45 designated healthcare institutions. A total of 16 proprietary Chinese medicines (pCms) for external use and one pCmfor oral use, allregistered in Hong Kong, have been approved for sale in the Chinese Mainland. Additionally, one Western medicine and two Chinese medicines have been approved for production and market launch in the GBA through a new cross-boundary contract manufacturing model, under which research, development and production occur in Hong Kong while manufacturing takes place in the GBA.

 During the Conference, representatives from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao exchanged viewson enhancing collaboration and training in drug evaluation and Good Manufacturing Practice inspection, as well as conducting international multi-centre clinical trials for innovative drugs and medical devices. In addition, the NMPA introduced the latest situation of various regulatory work, including the streamlining of approval procedures for Hong Kong- and Macao-registered traditional proprietary Chinese medicines for oral use.

 Other HKSAR Government representatives at the Conference include Deputy Secretary for Health,Ms Elaine Mak, and the Controller of Regulatory Affairs of the DH, Dr Fung Ying. Representatives from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, the GBAICTI, relevant departments from Guangdong Province and nine Chinese Mainland cities in the GBA also participated in the Conference."
食環署再度蟬聯最佳公廁獎項,2025-11-18 21:22,2025-11-18 22:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800880.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）發言人今日（十一月十八日）表示，很高興署方在今年香港廁所協會舉辦的年度最佳公廁選舉中，再次蟬聯金獎及銀獎。

獲得金獎的是中西區蘭桂坊公廁。該公廁裝有空氣調節系統，設有自動感應式水龍頭及梘液機、非接觸式沖廁系統等設施，更在周末及節假日安排廁所事務員24小時值勤。獲得銀獎的是元朗區錦田市公廁。該公廁外觀簡約樸實，結合明亮衞生的室內設計，以及提供三合一鏡櫃洗手盆（即自動感應式水龍頭、梘液機及乾手機一站式設計）、非接觸式沖廁系統等設施。

發言人說：「食環署近年來多管齊下，並引入新科技，提升轄下公廁的設施、管理和衞生水平，為使用者帶來更好的使用體驗。食環署的公廁連年獲獎，反映署方的工作得到認同，對此感到鼓舞。」

食環署早前已留意到西營盤街市內的廁所和九龍城道的公廁有設施老化跡象，因此已展開優化和翻新計劃。其中，位於西營盤街市地下樓層的廁所將於本月內竣工重開，該街市內的其他廁所亦會於未來幾個月進行工程。在優化和翻新工程完成前，食環署會加強清潔，並聯同相關部門加快維修損壞的設施。

發言人補充說：「食環署會繼續加強轄下廁所的清潔和管理，並以創新思維不斷提升公廁的設施和服務水平。食環署亦呼籲市民珍惜公共設施，保持公廁的清潔衞生。」

現時，食環署管理逾800所公廁。自二○一九／二○年度起，食環署和建築署積極推進優化公廁翻新計劃，截至今年九月已對約480所公廁展開全面翻新或優化工程，其中約190所的工程已完成。食環署和建築署透過提前規劃、簡化或壓縮前期工作流程、應用新建築法及技術等方法，致力於二○二八年年底前為全港餘下約200所公廁開展全面翻新或優化工程。

食環署亦積極善用科技提升公廁服務，包括已在15所公廁裝設傳感器，實時監測人流和環境參數，當偵測到異味濃度升至警報級別，系統會即時透過短訊通知負責人安排清潔；使用嶄新空氣淨化技術將污染物催化分解，從根源消除異味；並在個別公廁利用臭氧機將空氣中的氧氣轉換成臭氧，通過納米氣泡技術，有效氧化水中的細菌和病毒，防止生物膜在座廁表面形成及減低排泄物產生的異味。

食環署已在全港約200所位於旅遊景點或使用率高的公廁內安裝無線廣播系統，推廣廁所清潔衞生和正確使用設施的重要性。食環署亦正逐步將公廁清潔由街道清潔服務合約中分拆，改為專項合約方式獨立採購服務。新公廁管理服務合約亦加入條款，要求廁所事務員需曾接受相關職業培訓和具備認可資格，期望藉此提高服務水平。"

EEB and power companies announce 2026 electricity tariff adjustment (with photo/video),2025-11-18 20:05,2025-11-18 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800787.htm,"âThe Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) and the two power companies announced today (November 18) the electricity tariff adjustment for next year. After negotiation with the Government, CLP Power Hong Kong Limited and Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CLP Power) will reduce their average Net Tariff by 2.6 per cent to 140.6 cents per kWh with effect from January 1, 2026, and the Hongkong Electric Company Limited (HK Electric) will lower their average Net Tariff by 2.2 per cent to 163.3 cents per kWh.

The Secretary for the Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, said at the press conference today that the Government's energy policy objectives are to ensure that the public will enjoy safe, reliable and environmentally friendly electricity supply at reasonable costs. Therefore, the Government has been diligently playing a gate-keeping role in accordance with the Scheme of Control Agreements. After rounds of negotiations, the two power companies eventually agreed to lower the average Net Tariff starting January next year. Regarding the Basic Tariff, CLP Power agreed to reduce the next year's Basic Tariff to a level lower than the projected level of Basic Tariff under its five-year Development Plan, while HK Electric's Basic Tariff remains consistent with the projected level.

Mr Tse said, ""Based on the two power companies' estimates, after the tariff adjustment, a typical three-member family household with monthly consumption of 275kWh will pay around $10 less each month compared to the approved rates for 2025.""

The CLP Power Managing Director, Mr Joseph Law, said, ""We expect the tariff reduction to help lower living expenses of households and operating costs of small and medium-sized enterprises. We also allocate $270 million from the CLP Community Energy Saving Fund to promote energy conservation and decarbonisation, support the underprivileged, and inject momentum into Hong Kong's economy. While geopolitical tensions continue to pose uncertainties to fuel prices, we remain committed to managing fuel costs through a diversified fuel mix as well as upholding prudent financial management and enhancing operational efficiency with innovative technologies in delivering reliable, environmentally responsible, and reasonably priced electricity services.""

The HK Electric Managing Director, Mr Francis Cheng, said, ""HK Electric has been committed to providing Hong Kong with a safe, reliable, and clean electricity supply over the years. Through prudent planning, we continuously replace assets that have reached or exceeded their design or useful lives, in accordance with their depreciation cycles or actual condition to ensure a stable and reliable power supply while avoiding unnecessary capital investment. In light of the increasingly severe cyberattack threats, IT systems have to be enhanced also to strengthen their resilience. These capital investments inevitably put pressure on tariffs. Notwithstanding, the relatively stable fuel prices mean the fuel clause charge will be reduced, resulting in the net electricity tariff next year lower than that in January this year.""

Mr Tse said, ""Notwithstanding a minor reduction in average net tariff next January, we encourage the general public to cultivate a green living style and select energy efficient electrical appliances for environmental protection, which will help further reduce electricity expenditure and carbon emissions, and protect the environment. The Government's Mandatory Energy Efficiency Labelling Scheme (MEELS), which covers 11 types of appliances, has fully implemented new grading standards for refrigerating appliances, washing machines and storage type electric water heaters since September 2025. The full implementation of MEELS is expected to bring an additional energy saving of about 270 million kWh per year, which is equivalent to annual electricity consumption of 80 000 typical three-member family households. The public is encouraged to visit Energy Saving Tips in Government's webpage Energy Saving for All to get to know more about ways to save energy and practice 'smart electricity consumption' together."""
Speech by STL at Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board Flagship Session (English only) (with photo),2025-11-18 20:01,2025-11-18 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800718.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board Flagship Session - Hong Kong: A Global Maritime Capital today (November 18):

Dr Moses Cheng (Chairman of the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board), distinguished industry leaders, partners, friends,

Good afternoon. It is my privilege to join you and open this flagship session hosted by the newly established Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board. The conversations these days have confirmed a powerful consensus: The global maritime industry now stands at a tipping point, and the capital for the great maritime decarbonisation is ready to flow. The critical question is, where will it find its gateway?

In today's ever-changing global maritime landscape, I stand before you with immense confidence that Hong Kong is positioning itself as Asia's Green Maritime Finance Capital Gateway. What a lengthy word but it inherits a lot of wisdom, ambitions and visions in this long phrase. We are building the bridge that connects the vast global pools of green capital with the multi-trillion-dollar investment opportunities in sustainable shipping. I think sustainability is the keyword.

This is not an aspiration; it is a strategic evolution of our core strengths. Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong offers a unique advantage and convergence: a unique bilingual common law system that keeps pace with international maritime regulatory practices, the world's freest economy with seamless flow of capital, as well as a top-notch maritime cluster comprised of over 1 200 companies, many of which actually benefit from the series of tax concessionary measures that Hong Kong has provided by legal mandate over the years. This is the stable, trusted platform to de-risk and deploy capital into one of the world's most critical energy transitions. Our strategic positioning is propelled by three main drivers.

First, we have the proven financial firepower and a complete maritime ecosystem necessary to power this transition. Hong Kong's position as Asia's leading green finance hub is undisputable. Last year, our green and sustainable debt market surpassed US$84 billion, with bonds alone capturing 45 per cent of the regional market. We are also pioneering the green finance technology itself, from launching the world's first government-issued tokenised green bond to the first multi-currency digital bond. I do not know whether you have the opportunity to listen to the Financial Secretary's speech at the ICS (International Chamber of Shipping) open summit yesterday. He made three important key observations about the growth areas in China, Asia and this part of the region including Hong Kong where we are propelling. The figures that I mentioned just now provide clear evidence for the global shipping community with the sophisticated, diverse capital required for the heavy upfront investments in green vessels, fuel infrastructure and clean energy ports. Yet, financial depth alone is not enough. What truly sets Hong Kong apart is our complete, integrated maritime ecosystem - a one-stop shop for the entire industry. This comprehensive ecosystem provides unparalleled support, where you will find, for example, 11 of the 12 International Group P&I (protection and indemnity) clubs and eight of the world's top 10 ship finance bookrunners for your insurance and capital needs. For resolving maritime disputes, we are recognised by the Baltic International Maritime Council as one of the world's four designated arbitration venues. We did not get such recognition yesterday, but we achieved that a few years ago. I would also like to emphasise, for operational support, five of the top 10 global ship managers are here, with three headquartered in our city. All this evidence and data imply that your entire network of partners, financiers, and peers is concentrated here, providing the collaborative muscle to power through the complex challenges of the green transition. I cannot agree more; the peer, the companion, the enjoyment of food and wine, and the companionship of Hong Kong all make doing business so friendly and enjoyable in Hong Kong.

Second, we are establishing Hong Kong into a green fuel bunkering and trading hub to create the bankable assets that capital seeks. Pioneering investments carry higher costs, and the full benefit of green investments may not be realised due to, for example, the low availability of green fuels. Our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering, with its five core strengths and strategies and 10 concrete actions, provides exactly a definitive roadmap to propel the green fuel bunkering and trading development in Hong Kong. Leveraging our unparalleled access to the Chinese Mainland's green fuel production, we are already delivering tangible, quick results from setting the national record for the largest single delivery of biodiesel at a Chinese port, to successfully transition into regularised LNG (liquefied natural gas) bunkering in Hong Kong waters. In a way, we are starting late but catching up fast. Our focus now is on the next generation of fuels. We are pioneering the future with methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen. To accelerate this, we secured a duty exemption for methanol through legislation and will commence feasibility studies for ammonia and hydrogen bunkering soon this year. We recognise the first-mover disadvantage of high initial costs, and that is precisely why we launched the Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering Incentive Scheme in order to help our partners to de-risk and reward pioneering companies. Like different industries, our shipping partners also like recognition and rewards. Though it may be small to the big businesses, it really serves as a symbolism and demonstration of how much care and attention we show to the industry. Next year, we will introduce legislation for a half-rate profits tax concession for the eligible commodity traders including those who trade in green maritime fuels. Coupled with our ongoing matchmaking events that connect Chinese Mainland enterprises with global end-users, we are not just building a fuel hub; we are creating the entire landscape and liquid marketplace required to finance and sustain the global fleet's transition. And here my keyword will be marketplace. When we talk about food and wine, companion and peer, we need to have a marketplace. We should not say platform, working group or task force; we need to use marketplace in order to be more lively and enjoyable.

Third, we are de-risking the industry's green capital investment by providing unwavering regulatory certainty and forging strategic global partnerships. Over the past few days, there have been closed door and open-door discussions about the disruption and delay of the IMO (International Maritime Organization) schedule. But I think rule-based aside, this will not hinder Hong Kong's determination to create a buoyant and dynamic ecosystem to help forge our journey towards green transformation. While international timelines may shift, Hong Kong offers decisive clarity. At home, we are proactively building comprehensive regulatory frameworks - governing everything from green fuel bunkering, with our Codes of Practice for LNG and Methanol and a mandate for the use of mass flow meters for methanol bunkering by 2026. I found it amazing that this tool and standard are just so important for ensuring fairness and transparency in green fuel bunkering. We will be introducing this mandate for mass flow metres for methanol bunkering by 2026 to the sustainable end-of-life recycling of vessels via the recent enactment of the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships into the local legislation, and we will do this well before the market peaks, with a view to providing investors the necessary confidence and certainty to commit for tomorrow. While the international timeline seems to delay a little bit, we have to act fast and act now for the preparation tomorrow. Concurrently, we are building the infrastructure of international collaboration. As the Chief Executive announced yesterday, we have announced the first batch of partner ports and established partner ports relationships with Guangxi port and Dalian port on the Chinese Mainland, as well as San Antonio Port of Chile. We will continue to identify partner ports for developing green shipping corridors - dedicated routes where vessels can achieve low or zero-carbon operations through co-ordinated green port services and fuel availability. For investors, these corridors could be strategic de-risking instruments that concentrate green capital, create scalable access and testbeds for zero-carbon operations, and, most importantly, drive down first-mover costs through knowledge and technological exchanges, ensuring today's pioneering investments become tomorrow's commercial success.

Ladies and gentlemen, the course is charted, the consensus is clear, and the capital is ready. In Hong Kong, if not other places. In Hong Kong, you can find more than just a port or a financial centre; you can find your strategic gateway for your green maritime finance capital, with our financial firepower to fund your ambitions, physical bunkering and trading hubs to power your vessels, and the regulatory certainty and global partnerships and a marketplace to de-risk your investments. The tides of change are not a threat to be weathered, but a powerful current we can harness together. We have the strategy, the ecosystem, and the unwavering commitment to succeed. So let me conclude with a clear invitation: Do not just navigate this transition - lead it from Hong Kong. Anchor your sustainable future here, and let us work in partnership to steer the global maritime industry towards a more prosperous and resilient zero-carbon future. Thank you very much."
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-18 19:35,2025-11-18 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800785.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 18),the CHP has recorded one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
--------------------------

  The case involves a 26-year-old male living alone in Yau Tsim Mong District. Initial investigation revealed that during his solo trip to India between November 5 and 15, he developed a fever and joint pain on November 8 and 9 respectively. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department at Kwong Wah Hospital yesterday (November 17) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. His blood sample tested positive for chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. He is currently in stable condition.

  Since the patient stayed in India during his incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected overseas. The case is classified as imported. The CHP will report the case to the relevant health authority.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 64 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, the recent outbreak of CF has shown a sustained downward trend. There were 48 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (November 9 to 15), showing a further decrease compared to the previous week (November 2 to 8), which reported 107 cases. The cases last week were mainly reported in Jiangmen (14 cases) and Shenzhen (12 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

Regarding the recently announced local case involving a 68-year-old female who lives in Tung Hei Court in Shau Kei Wan, the CHP is still conducting genome analysis.

The CHP urged the residents living in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 15. The CHP collaborated with the Eastern District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention and questionnaire surveys to about 3 000 households in the affected areas in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

  As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 4 900 individuals through the health consultation booth on 2/F, Hing Tung Shopping Centre in Shau Kei Wan, its inquiry hotline (2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits at Tung Hei Court. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past three days. Four individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests, and all testednegative for the chikungunya virus. Given the significant decrease in the number of citizens visiting the health consultation booth recently and all individuals who underwent blood tests at the booth concerned have negative results, the operating hours of the booth will be adjusted starting tomorrow (November 19) based on actual needs. Please refer to the CHP'swebpagefor the actual operating hours of the health consultation booth.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-18 19:35,2025-11-18 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800784.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月十八日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名26歲男子，獨居於油尖旺區。初步調查顯示，他於十一月五日至十五日獨自到訪印度期間，先後出現發燒和關節痛（十一月八日和九日），昨日（十一月十七日）到廣華醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，目前情況穩定。

由於病人在潛伏期內身處印度，中心認為他是在海外受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會把個案通報當地衞生部門。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得64宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，近期基孔肯雅熱疫情呈持續下降趨勢。過去一周（十一月九日至十五日）廣東省新增48宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較對上一周（十一月二日至八日）的107宗進一步回落。上周個案主要分布在江門市（14宗）和深圳市（12宗）。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

就早前公布一宗涉及一名住在筲箕灣東熹苑的68歲女子的本地個案，中心仍在對該病人的病毒基因進行分析工作。

中心呼籲該名患者居所一帶居民，如於十月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員和東區關愛隊已向東熹苑一帶受影響地區約3 000個單位派發有關預防基孔肯雅熱的資料單張及問卷，提醒居民留意有否相關病徵和注意家居的環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過設於筲箕灣興東商場二樓的醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於東熹苑進行上門探訪，為逾4 900名市民進行評估，過去三日未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。中心已為四名早前出現輕微病徵的市民進行抽血檢查，全部對基孔肯雅病毒的檢測為陰性。鑑於近日前往醫護站的市民明顯減少，加上全部於上述醫護站接受抽血檢查的人士結果均為陰性，明日（十一月十九日）起，醫護站的運作時間會因應實際需要而調整，確實時間請參閱中心網站。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

Hong Kong's NextGen Logistician Awards 2025 presentation ceremony held to recognise outstanding young logistics talent (with photo),2025-11-18 19:33,2025-11-18 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800519.htm,"  The presentation ceremony of Hong Kong's NextGen Logistician Awards 2025 was held today (November 18) during the Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference 2025, recognising young talent in the logistics industry who have made significant achievements and shown remarkable potential in innovative, high-end, smart and green logistics.

  The Awards is an annual event for the logistics industry advocated by the Transport and Logistics Bureau in the Action Plan on Modern Logistics Development, and is co-organised by various sectors of Hong Kong's logistics trade with the support of the Hong Kong Logistics Development Council (LOGSCOUNCIL). It aims to commend outstanding young logisticians and, through the success stories of the award winners, introduce new development directions of modern logistics to the public with a view to attracting more young people to join the industry to propel its continual growth. Following the success of its inauguration in 2024, the Awards returned in its second edition this year.

  Speaking at the ceremony, the Under Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Mr Liu Chun-san, said that he was glad to see the awardees this year representing a wide range of sectors, including e-commerce fulfilment, engineering, technological innovation, container terminal operation and cargo handling. That reflects the multidisciplinary and cross-sector nature of Hong Kong's logistics-hub status. He emphasised that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will continue nurturing logistics talent through various talent development initiatives, including sponsoring promotion activities, providing job-shadowing and internship placements, and organising school talks and visits to logistics companies for primary and secondary school students, with a view to arousing the younger generation's interest in modern logistics and encouraging them to consider joining the sector in future.

  Mr Liu also said that the active participation of industry stakeholders and legislative councilors is indispensable to the development of Hong Kong's logistics industry. Therefore, he encouraged all voters to cast votes on the polling day of the Legislative Council General Election on December 7 to elect representatives who are capable of and dedicated to contributing to a better future for Hong Kong.

  This year's Awards featured two categories. A judging panel comprising representatives from the Government, LOGSCOUNCIL and logistics leaders selected the following five winners (in no particular order) through a two-stage adjudication process according to five major criteria, namely professional accomplishments, individual contributions and commitment to the logistics industry, continuous learning and self-development, leadership and pioneering endeavours/being an industry first-mover:

Hong Kong's NextGen Logistician Awards 2025 presentation ceremony held to recognise outstanding young logistics talent (with photos),2025-11-18 19:33,2025-11-18 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800519.htm,"  The presentation ceremony of Hong Kong's NextGen Logistician Awards 2025 was held today (November 18) during the Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference 2025, recognising young talent in the logistics industry who have made significant achievements and shown remarkable potential in innovative, high-end, smart and green logistics.

  The Awards is an annual event for the logistics industry advocated by the Transport and Logistics Bureau in the Action Plan on Modern Logistics Development, and is co-organised by various sectors of Hong Kong's logistics trade with the support of the Hong Kong Logistics Development Council (LOGSCOUNCIL). It aims to commend outstanding young logisticians and, through the success stories of the award winners, introduce new development directions of modern logistics to the public with a view to attracting more young people to join the industry to propel its continual growth. Following the success of its inauguration in 2024, the Awards returned in its second edition this year.

  Speaking at the ceremony, the Under Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Mr Liu Chun-san, said that he was glad to see the awardees this year representing a wide range of sectors, including e-commerce fulfilment, engineering, technological innovation, container terminal operation and cargo handling. That reflects the multidisciplinary and cross-sector nature of Hong Kong's logistics-hub status. He emphasised that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will continue nurturing logistics talent through various talent development initiatives, including sponsoring promotion activities, providing job-shadowing and internship placements, and organising school talks and visits to logistics companies for primary and secondary school students, with a view to arousing the younger generation's interest in modern logistics and encouraging them to consider joining the sector in future.

  Mr Liu also said that the active participation of industry stakeholders and legislative councilors is indispensable to the development of Hong Kong's logistics industry. Therefore, he encouraged all voters to cast votes on the polling day of the Legislative Council General Election on December 7 to elect representatives who are capable of and dedicated to contributing to a better future for Hong Kong.

  This year's Awards featured two categories. A judging panel comprising representatives from the Government, LOGSCOUNCIL and logistics leaders selected the following five winners (in no particular order) through a two-stage adjudication process according to five major criteria, namely professional accomplishments, individual contributions and commitment to the logistics industry, continuous learning and self-development, leadership and pioneering endeavours/being an industry first-mover:

Young Professional Award:

CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another severe paediatric influenza infection case reported,2025-11-18 19:32,2025-11-18 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800786.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 18) recorded a severe paediatric influenza infection case. The CHP reiterated its appeal to urge schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves a 14-year-old boy with underlying illness. He developed a convulsion on November 14 and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of United Christian Hospital, where was admitted. Yesterday (November 17), he developed dizziness, a fever and cough with sputum. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with pneumonia and shock. He is currently in serious condition.

The boy had not yet received the 2025/26 SIV. His household contacts are currently asymptomatic and no influenza outbreaks have been reported at his school recently.

Including the abovementioned case, there have been 19 severe influenza cases involving children so far this summer influenza season, including two fatal cases. The affected children aged 11 months to 17 years. Ten cases have been recorded since the launch of this year's SIV Programmes, with only one having received this year's SIV four days prior to the onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, in other words, these severe influenza cases are not protected by the vaccine.

""According to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity began to decline in the last week of October. However, it remains at a relatively high level. As the weather turns cooler, influenza activity may still fluctuate. Moreover, a winter influenza season may occur early next year. Therefore, I once again urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV to do so promptly. Compared to the winter influenza season earlier this year, there have been more severe paediatric influenza infection cases this season. Currently, among children aged below 18 years, the coverage rate of children aged 6 months to under 2 years is relatively low, at nearly 16 per cent only. Parents should not hesitate and should contact their family doctors as soon as possible to arrange for their children, as well as themselves and other family members, to receive the SIV,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

He also reminded members of the public that, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."
Hong Kong Customs commences second phase of Pilot Run for Duty Stamp System (with photos),2025-11-18 19:32,2025-11-18 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800743.htm,"The first phase of the three-month Pilot Run for the Duty Stamp System launched by Hong Kong Customs on October 6 was completed recently and entered into the second phase starting yesterday (November 17).

The first phase of the Pilot Run, aimed to simulate the operational procedures of the Duty Stamp System in a real setting for testing related technologies and getting prepared for the next phase of testing. During the first phase, Customs not only affixed trial duty stamps to duty-paid cigarettes brought into Hong Kong by travellers or imported via small shipments at the Duty Collection Offices, but also conducted technical tests in actual operational environments using equipment from local cigarette manufacturers. This included building a computer module for testing the data system, affixing trial duty stamps during the production process, the storage of products in bonded warehouses after production, and releasing them to the retail market after duty payment, covering the entire logistics chain.

The test results of the first phase and opinions collected through questionnaires reflected that the general public indicated a positive attitude towards the design of the duty stamp and a success rate of over 99 per cent in the affixation of stamps during production was achieved.

In the second phase of the Pilot Run, Customs will use enhanced trial duty stamps which adopt thinner paper and a hologram as an anti-counterfeiting feature in the design. Cigarettes affixed with stamps, depending on their status of duty payment, will be available at retail outlets across all districts successively, allowing more members of the public access to the trial duty stamps.

Meanwhile, the second phase of the Pilot Run will be extended to cover more Duty Collection Offices at various control points, including Lo Wu, Heung Yuen Wai, and the West Kowloon Station of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, for affixing trial duty stamps to cigarettes carried by travellers exceeding the duty free concession after payment of duties.

  Customs will continue to promote the Duty Stamp System and actively communicate with the tobacco industry (including cigarette importers), as well as invite them to participate in the second phase of the Pilot Run. Customs will hold briefing sessions to provide more information on the duty stamp affixing procedures information, and distribute trial duty stamp samples for reference. Customs will also collect feedback from the industry through questionnaires with a view to enhancing the planning of the Duty Stamp System and thus achieve the ultimate goal of effective distinguishment of duty-paid cigarettes from duty-not-paid ones, and to combat the ""cheap whites"".

In response to the presence of sales outlets selling suspected duty-not-paid cigarettes below tobacco duty on the market, Customs will continue to step up patrol operations and closely monitor the latest market situation. Customs will take decisive enforcement action if any form of illicit cigarette trading activities is found.

Under the amended Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO), cigarettes sold at a price lower than the tobacco duty must be proven to be duty-paid, otherwise the cigarettes are presumed to be duty-not-paid.

Customs appeals to retailers not to sell cigarettes from unknown sources. Retailers must stay vigilant against cigarettes with wholesale prices lower than the tobacco duty in order to avoid criminal liability. Customs reminds retailers and members of the public that under the DCO, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years."
​香港海關開展第二階段的完稅標籤制度先導計劃（附圖）,2025-11-18 19:32,2025-11-18 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800741.htm,"香港海關十月六日開展為期三個月的完稅標籤制度先導計劃於早前完成第一階段的測試，並於昨日（十一月十七日）展開第二階段先導計劃。

第一階段的測試，旨在於實際操作環境中模擬完稅標籤制度的運作流程及測試相關技術，為下一階段測試做好準備。在第一階段測試中，海關除了於海關課稅室為旅客帶入或以貨件進口香港的完稅香煙附貼試行完稅標籤外，亦借用本地香煙生產商的設備於實際操作環境中進行技術測試，包括構建電腦模組測試數據系統、於生產過程中附貼試行完稅標籤及將有關產品暫存保稅倉，並於完稅後推出零售市場的整個物流鏈流程。

綜合第一階段的測試結果及透過問卷收集的意見，顯示公眾對完稅標籤的設計均傾向正面，而生產過程中附貼標籤的成功率亦超過百分之九十九。

在第二階段的先導計劃中，海關會使用經優化的試行完稅標籤，其設計採用更輕薄的紙質及印上雷射圖案的防偽技術，已附貼標籤的香煙將視乎完稅情況，陸續推出全港的零售點出售，讓更多市民接觸到試行完稅標籤。

另一方面，第二階段的先導計劃亦會拓展至更多邊境口岸的海關課稅室，包括羅湖、香園圍及廣深港高速鐵路西九龍站，為旅客攜帶超過免稅限額的香煙在完稅後附貼試行完稅標籤。

海關將繼續推廣完稅標籤制度，並積極與煙草業界（包括香煙入口商）進行溝通，包括邀請他們參與第二階段的先導計劃。海關稍後將舉行講解會向業界提供標籤附貼流程資料及派發試行完稅標籤樣本作參考，並會透過問卷形式收集業界的意見，期望有關計劃能夠有助於完善完稅標籤制度的規劃，有效區分已完稅和未完稅香煙，打擊「白牌煙」。

針對市面有商販以低於煙草稅的價格銷售懷疑未完稅香煙，海關會繼續加強巡查並密切留意市場的最新情況，如發現任何形式的私煙買賣活動，必定會果斷執法。

根據新修訂《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），售價低於煙草稅的煙支須證明已課稅，否則會被推定為未完稅香煙。

海關呼籲各零售商切勿售賣來歷不明的香煙，對來貨價低於煙草稅的香煙，必須提高警覺，以避免刑事責任。海關提醒零售商和市民，根據《條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。"

The event aimed to enhance FDHs' understanding of the Immigration Ordinance and raise their awareness of issues relating to trafficking in persons.

  During the seminar, ImmD Enforcement Branch officers reminded FDHs that they should only perform domestic duties for the employer specified in their employment contract and should not take up any other employment for other persons. They briefed the FDHs on key matters to note while working in Hong Kong and provided practical information to them. Officers also appealed to them not to take up any unapproved employment or to overstay. Important information on trafficking in persons was also shared to raise the FDHs' awareness.

  Representatives of the Consulate General attended the event. They expressed gratitude to the ImmD for its support and stated that the Consulate General will continue to work closely with the ImmD to further promote publicity and education for newly arrived foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong."

Also attending the meeting were the Chairman of the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board (HKMPDB), Dr Moses Cheng, and the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers (HKFI), Ms Selina Lau.

Ms Chan welcomed the visit of leaders of the international marine insurance sector to Hong Kong. She said that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government attaches great importance to maintaining close ties with the global maritime industry and actively participates in meetings and exchange activities of the IUMI to keep abreast of the latest developments in the global shipping and marine insurance fields. Over the years, the IUMI has been committed to promoting the professional development and international standards of the global marine insurance industry, and has maintained good collaboration with the industry in Hong Kong. The IUMI established its first Asian hub in Hong Kong in 2016 to enhance support for marine insurance in the Asian region.

She added that following the official establishment of the Hong Kong Shipowners Mutual Assurance Association at the World Maritime Merchants Forum 2025 Government Summit yesterday (November 17), she was pleased to note that the HKMPDB and the IUMI has further signed a Memorandum of Understanding on talent training for the marine insurance industry at an event co-organised by the IUMI and the HKFI during HKMW 2025 today. This will help enhance the industry's alignment with international standards, further elevate Hong Kong's international status in the field of high value-added maritime services, and promote the development of high value-added maritime professional training. In addition, the Maritime Services Traineeship Scheme - Marine Insurance under the Maritime and Aviation Training Fund has been launched to encourage insurance companies and insurance broker companies engaged in marine insurance business to provide internship opportunities for those aspiring to pursue a career in marine insurance.

She added that 11 out of the 12 member associations of the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Clubs provide services in Hong Kong, evidencing the vibrancy and internationalisation of Hong Kong's marine insurance development. Hong Kong's advantages, including the ""one country, two systems"" principle, a bilingual common law system, a free economy and a simple and low tax regime, make it an ideal city for global maritime service enterprises to set up their businesses and provide quality maritime services for global shipping enterprises. The HKSAR Government will further promote the development of high value-added maritime services with a view to developing Hong Kong into a leading international maritime centre."

醫務衞生局局長和教育局局長會見傳媒談籌備新醫學院最新進度的答問內容,2025-11-18 18:54,2025-11-18 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800725.htm,"醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士今日（十一月十八日）會見傳媒公布籌備新醫學院的最新進度。以下是盧寵茂教授和蔡若蓮博士會見傳媒的答問內容：

記者：兩條問題，首先是早前盧局長你提到，三間申請大學的財務安排的差異都比較大，可否談談最終提交的計劃書中，三間的分別在哪裏？相比其他兩間，科大比較欠缺一些醫護、醫療專科的課程，它最終勝出是否因為財務安排優勝？政府的資助最後會有多少？第二方面，剛才提到清水灣會建醫學院綜合大樓，想弄清楚第三間醫學院最終會落戶清水灣？有沒有牛潭尾用地的情況？如不在牛潭尾發展，會否影響整個北都計劃？亦想問工作組在票數上，究竟三間的票數是怎樣？

醫務衞生局局長：多謝這個問題。首先，整個評核不會用單一標準。我一開始已經說了，我們有十個準則，財務安排是其中一個。科技大學的方案，我們看到有一些很優秀的地方，特別是它的策略定位是非常清晰，而它的全球視野是相當廣闊，我們覺得它在競爭力，以至吸引力方面，對未來招聘教授人手，以至學生方面，都會有一定優勢。加上它在科研方面的優勢，而它的定位是融合醫療與科研於一體。最後，它的財務安排亦能配合《財政預算案》中提出，用一個配對形式來提供資助籌建這間新醫學院，這包括它在其清水灣院校內自己興建一幢醫學院的綜合大樓，以至在其他方面的營運過程，他們都提出配對安排。它現時的財務方案，在比率上，與政府出的資金，在未來25年間，包括一些基建項目，以至營運資金，與政府是相約的，差不多是一與一的比例。這符合政府在財政預算方面提出的配對政策，而我們亦看到它在財政方面的實力是比較雄厚。詳細的情況，科技大學很快會向大家安排一個介紹會，向大家介紹其方案。

至於校舍，牛潭尾作爲醫學院，以至未來教學醫院的位置，現時的政策是沒有改變的，我們的目標仍然是以牛潭尾作爲我們未來新醫學院，以至教學醫院的校舍。但是，在這校舍未建成之前，科技大學提出了一個過渡期的校舍，以及教學培訓醫院的方案。其中，醫學院選址在它的清水灣校園內，以其現有的一些教學資源，特別是它會加建一幢醫學院的綜合大樓在清水灣校園中，由它自己全資負責，作為由二○二八年開始，如果招收第一批學生，直到牛潭尾醫學院的新校舍建好之前的教學用途。

至於票數，其實工作組不是用一個這麽簡單「數票」方法，因爲我們都強調，整個過程要專業、全面、綜合，亦很公正地評核，基於十個標準，每一個標準都有自己的強項，我們沒有就每一個標準用一個「打分制」，但最終我們達至一個大多數支持科技大學的建議書。

記者：整體資助額為多少？

醫務衞生局局長：我們想等科技大學向大家詳細公布後，再進一步公布。詳細的財政安排會在諒解備忘錄中詳列。不過，現在給大家知道的是，我們是以一個配對模式，政府的出資是會與科技大學相約。

記者：關於招生學額，想問其實50位首階段招生的學生，非本地生的比例有多少？第二條問題，之前提及過第三間醫學院其實與另外兩間大學有錯位發展，以科大目前的發展計劃，其實跟另外兩間大學有何不同？

教育局局長：就非本地招生學額（比例），UGC（大學教育資助委員會）現時（已放寬）對非本地學生設有以超額收生形式（相當於本地學額數目）百分之五十的上限，（供新醫學院參照）。醫學教育是特殊人力規劃的學科，我們會密切留意收生情況，以及本地生與非本地生的比例。就錯位發展，最基本他們（就讀學生）是second degree entry，即第二學位入學。醫學教學方面，我請盧局長補充。

醫務衞生局局長：沒錯，錯位發展是非常重要的，我們這次在籌建第三間醫學院時，一開始已經提出，亦要求所有建議書都要做到這一點。原因是我們有兩所非常優秀的醫學院──港大醫學院和中大醫學院，我們希望在建立第三間醫學院的時候真正做到良性競爭，而不是惡性競爭，其中包括新醫學院本身的策略定位。剛才我提到，它是以結合醫療服務和科研，希望培養出一些醫生的科學家。在招收學生方面，它是第二學位課程，即是所有畢業生並不是中學畢業生，這會擴大我們招攬人才到香港讀醫。全世界最知名的大學，它們的第一學位本科的畢業生，特別是修讀與生物醫學學科有關的，都是我們招攬人才的其中一個途徑。而在招聘教職員、教授方面，我們強調它會有多途徑招聘，特別是向全世界招攬人才，這方面我們看到科技大學過往有很多優勢。

另外，在科研方面我們亦看到科技大學的科研成果，雖然它現時未有醫療方面的教學，但它在生命科學方面、人工智能、大數據方面都有很多強項，科技大學在人工智能以至大數據，或在某些生命科學，例如腦神經科學的發展，亦有相當高的成就，我們希望能夠在這方面幫助它，醫學院的發展會有助它將這些優勢應用至生命醫學臨床方面。

記者：做這個決定的時候，當中有沒有分歧？剛才說到不是按「打分制」或者不是簡單用票數去決定，但其實當中專家之間會不會有分歧？可能有其他選擇？可否交代一下其實在決定、決策過程有沒有爭議？另外，關於收生安排，說到有機會收到非本地生，其實早前說過不會為非本地生定居港年期，即居港工作年期，但外界有聲音擔心有些學生如果是非本地生，他們畢業後未必懂得說廣東話，或者可能跟病人交流上有些阻礙，推出課程之後會不會要求畢業生要懂得說廣東話？

教育局局長：就非本地生收生要求或醫學院課程，剛才盧醫生已提到，院校除培育醫療人才，同時也進行科研。來港的非本地生亦明白，我們希望培養能服務香港醫療系統，以及貢獻香港醫學教育創新（的人才），因此在語言方面，我相信大學安排課程時會考慮這一點。至於畢業生留港，現時無論甚麼學科，我們均鼓勵非本地學生留港工作，因此我們設有IANG計劃，即非本地畢業生留港／回港就業安排，提供24個月簽證，這安排亦適用於這個新學科。

醫務衞生局局長：我補充一下，我在醫學院工作相當長的時間，其實醫學教育有其獨特地方，因爲醫學很多時我們要面對病人，所以語言的溝通能力絕對是有需要的。我們明白香港大部分人說廣東話，我們亦要知道也有很多人說其他語言，包括普通話、英文，特別是以香港這麽國際化的城市，其實在很多方面我都希望我們的專業人員，特別是醫療人員能夠做到兩文三語。現有兩間醫學院在收生方面對語言都有一個要求，而第三間醫學院亦會在這方面作出一些適應，在入學時可能會有一定的要求，在課程內亦會有針對語言溝通能力，因爲溝通其實在醫學課程中是一個重要的元素。

至於你提到在評審過程中專家組有沒有分歧，我再次重申強調，三間大學提出的方案都是非常精細，也有很多創新的地方，有些我們也未曾想過。不只是專家有分歧，我自己也曾經「腦交戰」。在看三間大學提出的方案時，特別是十個準則，一定會出現某些準則是A大學優勝，有些是B大學優勝，有些是C大學優勝，這是無可避免的。但通過大家討論，更加重要的是我們要跟三間大學作實際溝通，它們提出文字上的建議書，是需要進一步跟它們細化和了解實際情況，所以整個討論是基於專業和總體全面而作出最後的判斷。

醫務衞生局局長和教育局局長會見傳媒談籌備新醫學院最新進度的答問內容（附短片）,2025-11-18 18:54,2025-11-18 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800725.htm,"醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士今日（十一月十八日）會見傳媒公布籌備新醫學院的最新進度。以下是盧寵茂教授和蔡若蓮博士會見傳媒的答問內容：

記者：兩條問題，首先是早前盧局長你提到，三間申請大學的財務安排的差異都比較大，可否談談最終提交的計劃書中，三間的分別在哪裏？相比其他兩間，科大比較欠缺一些醫護、醫療專科的課程，它最終勝出是否因為財務安排優勝？政府的資助最後會有多少？第二方面，剛才提到清水灣會建醫學院綜合大樓，想弄清楚第三間醫學院最終會落戶清水灣？有沒有牛潭尾用地的情況？如不在牛潭尾發展，會否影響整個北都計劃？亦想問工作組在票數上，究竟三間的票數是怎樣？

醫務衞生局局長：多謝這個問題。首先，整個評核不會用單一標準。我一開始已經說了，我們有十個準則，財務安排是其中一個。科技大學的方案，我們看到有一些很優秀的地方，特別是它的策略定位是非常清晰，而它的全球視野是相當廣闊，我們覺得它在競爭力，以至吸引力方面，對未來招聘教授人手，以至學生方面，都會有一定優勢。加上它在科研方面的優勢，而它的定位是融合醫療與科研於一體。最後，它的財務安排亦能配合《財政預算案》中提出，用一個配對形式來提供資助籌建這間新醫學院，這包括它在其清水灣院校內自己興建一幢醫學院的綜合大樓，以至在其他方面的營運過程，他們都提出配對安排。它現時的財務方案，在比率上，與政府出的資金，在未來25年間，包括一些基建項目，以至營運資金，與政府是相約的，差不多是一與一的比例。這符合政府在財政預算方面提出的配對政策，而我們亦看到它在財政方面的實力是比較雄厚。詳細的情況，科技大學很快會向大家安排一個介紹會，向大家介紹其方案。

至於校舍，牛潭尾作爲醫學院，以至未來教學醫院的位置，現時的政策是沒有改變的，我們的目標仍然是以牛潭尾作爲我們未來新醫學院，以至教學醫院的校舍。但是，在這校舍未建成之前，科技大學提出了一個過渡期的校舍，以及教學培訓醫院的方案。其中，醫學院選址在它的清水灣校園內，以其現有的一些教學資源，特別是它會加建一幢醫學院的綜合大樓在清水灣校園中，由它自己全資負責，作為由二○二八年開始，如果招收第一批學生，直到牛潭尾醫學院的新校舍建好之前的教學用途。

至於票數，其實工作組不是用一個這麽簡單「數票」方法，因爲我們都強調，整個過程要專業、全面、綜合，亦很公正地評核，基於十個標準，每一個標準都有自己的強項，我們沒有就每一個標準用一個「打分制」，但最終我們達至一個大多數支持科技大學的建議書。

記者：整體資助額為多少？

醫務衞生局局長：我們想等科技大學向大家詳細公布後，再進一步公布。詳細的財政安排會在諒解備忘錄中詳列。不過，現在給大家知道的是，我們是以一個配對模式，政府的出資是會與科技大學相約。

記者：關於招生學額，想問其實50位首階段招生的學生，非本地生的比例有多少？第二條問題，之前提及過第三間醫學院其實與另外兩間大學有錯位發展，以科大目前的發展計劃，其實跟另外兩間大學有何不同？

教育局局長：就非本地招生學額（比例），UGC（大學教育資助委員會）現時（已放寬）對非本地學生設有以超額收生形式（相當於本地學額數目）百分之五十的上限，（供新醫學院參照）。醫學教育是特殊人力規劃的學科，我們會密切留意收生情況，以及本地生與非本地生的比例。就錯位發展，最基本他們（就讀學生）是second degree entry，即第二學位入學。醫學教學方面，我請盧局長補充。

醫務衞生局局長：沒錯，錯位發展是非常重要的，我們這次在籌建第三間醫學院時，一開始已經提出，亦要求所有建議書都要做到這一點。原因是我們有兩所非常優秀的醫學院──港大醫學院和中大醫學院，我們希望在建立第三間醫學院的時候真正做到良性競爭，而不是惡性競爭，其中包括新醫學院本身的策略定位。剛才我提到，它是以結合醫療服務和科研，希望培養出一些醫生的科學家。在招收學生方面，它是第二學位課程，即是所有畢業生並不是中學畢業生，這會擴大我們招攬人才到香港讀醫。全世界最知名的大學，它們的第一學位本科的畢業生，特別是修讀與生物醫學學科有關的，都是我們招攬人才的其中一個途徑。而在招聘教職員、教授方面，我們強調它會有多途徑招聘，特別是向全世界招攬人才，這方面我們看到科技大學過往有很多優勢。

另外，在科研方面我們亦看到科技大學的科研成果，雖然它現時未有醫療方面的教學，但它在生命科學方面、人工智能、大數據方面都有很多強項，科技大學在人工智能以至大數據，或在某些生命科學，例如腦神經科學的發展，亦有相當高的成就，我們希望能夠在這方面幫助它，醫學院的發展會有助它將這些優勢應用至生命醫學臨床方面。

記者：做這個決定的時候，當中有沒有分歧？剛才說到不是按「打分制」或者不是簡單用票數去決定，但其實當中專家之間會不會有分歧？可能有其他選擇？可否交代一下其實在決定、決策過程有沒有爭議？另外，關於收生安排，說到有機會收到非本地生，其實早前說過不會為非本地生定居港年期，即居港工作年期，但外界有聲音擔心有些學生如果是非本地生，他們畢業後未必懂得說廣東話，或者可能跟病人交流上有些阻礙，推出課程之後會不會要求畢業生要懂得說廣東話？

教育局局長：就非本地生收生要求或醫學院課程，剛才盧醫生已提到，院校除培育醫療人才，同時也進行科研。來港的非本地生亦明白，我們希望培養能服務香港醫療系統，以及貢獻香港醫學教育創新（的人才），因此在語言方面，我相信大學安排課程時會考慮這一點。至於畢業生留港，現時無論甚麼學科，我們均鼓勵非本地學生留港工作，因此我們設有IANG計劃，即非本地畢業生留港／回港就業安排，提供24個月簽證，這安排亦適用於這個新學科。

At the meeting, members were briefed by government representatives on the new initiatives relating to youth development in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"". Members were pleased to note that the Policy Address has introduced a series of measures to promote youth exchange and development, providing continuous all-round support for young people to unleash their potential. Among other initiatives, the Government will launch the Young Talent Training Programme, which includes (i) providing more opportunities for young people to intern at international organisations and attend international conferences; (ii) introducing a new media thematic internship programme on the Mainland; (iii) strengthening the Youth Financial Education Programme; and (iv) launching new mediation workshops to enhance young people's understanding of the mediation industry.

Furthermore, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) reported on the latest progress of promoting youth innovation and entrepreneurship at the meeting. The Alliance of Hong Kong Youth Innovation and Entrepreneurial Bases in the Greater Bay Area, established by the HYAB together with the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the People's Government of Guangdong Province, and the Human Resources and Social Security Department of Guangdong Province, has pooled resources from 70 member organisations to provide a one-stop information, publicity and exchange platform to support Hong Kong young people who start businesses in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Funded projects under the new round of the HYAB Funding Scheme for Youth Entrepreneurship in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the HYAB Funding Scheme for Experiential Programmes at Innovation and Entrepreneurial Bases have also commenced progressively since this year. The funding schemes respectively provide capital funding and entrepreneurial support and incubation services for youth start-ups and facilitate young people in exploring the on-site entrepreneurial environment in the GBA and other Mainland provinces and municipalities.

Mr Chan said, ""The latest Policy Address continues to inject fresh impetus into youth development work. The Government will continue to work hand in hand with the YDC in future, rallying the strength of all sectors of society to implement the various youth development measures in the Policy Address and the Youth Development Blueprint, helping young people achieve their aspirations and realise their full potential.""

âAt the meeting, Mr Chan also appealed to members to cast their votes on the polling day of the Legislative Council (LegCo) General Election on December 7 and to help promote the election among their family members, relatives, friends and affiliated associations, so as to elect a new term of responsible, visionary and capable LegCo Members."

CE meets Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economic Sciences (with photo),2025-11-18 18:45,2025-11-18 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800704.htm,"The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, today (November 18) met with two Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economic Sciences in 2001, Professor Joseph E Stiglitz and Professor Michael Spence, to exchange views on issues of mutual interest including the economy, innovation and technology (I&T), and education. The Director of the Chief Executive's Office, Ms Carol Yip, and the Head of the Chief Executive's Policy Unit, Dr Stephen Wong, also attended the meeting.

 Mr Lee welcomed Professor Stiglitz and Professor Spence to Hong Kong to attend the International Forum on China's Economy and Policy 2025 to share their insights on the economic development of the world, the country and Hong Kong. Mr Lee said he was pleased that the two scholars are optimistic about Hong Kong's development prospects, recognise its notable strengths in education and I&T, and support the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government's various strategic plans of diversifying investments, exploring emerging markets, and further deepening collaborative developments in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to seize opportunities.

 Mr Lee noted that Hong Kong enjoys the dual advantage of having national and global opportunities under the ""one country, two systems"" principle and will continue to play the roles of a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", connecting the Mainland with the world, fully integrating into the overall national development and actively dovetailing with GBA developments. As one of the core cities of the GBA, Hong Kong plays a vital role in driving regional development. The HKSAR Government will continue to collaborate with GBA cities in strengthening connectivity and enhancing the flow of people, goods, data and capital, with a view to further encouraging and supporting enterprises and talent to grasp development opportunities in the GBA.

 Mr Lee highlighted that Hong Kong is the world's freest economy, which attracts global capital and top talent, and has maintained its position of third globally and first in Asia Pacific as an international financial centre according to the newly published Global Financial Centres Index. Hong Kong is the only city worldwide that hosts five universities ranked among the world's top 100, and its ranking leapt to fourth globally in the newly published World Talent Ranking 2025, marking its highest-ever ranking. The HKSAR Government is actively accelerating the development of the Northern Metropolis University Town and promoting the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand to further develop Hong Kong into an international hub for post-secondary education and high-calibre talent.

 Noting that the world is undergoing unprecedented changes at an accelerating pace and facing global economic uncertainties, Mr Lee said that the HKSAR Government is continuously seeking new growth opportunities. Among these, the Northern Metropolis being developed at full steam serves as a new engine for Hong Kong's economic growth, boasting significant development potential and economic value. It is expected to create more jobs and enhance productivity for Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKSAR Government is vigorously promoting I&T, artificial intelligence, and related industries, while advancing the development of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, and fostering the integrated development of education, technology, and talent to develop Hong Kong into an international I&T centre with a view to contributing to the country's high-quality development."

環境及生態局與兩電公布二○二六年電費調整（附圖／短片）,2025-11-18 18:40,2025-11-18 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800721.htm,"環境及生態局聯同兩間電力公司（兩電）今日（十一月十八日）公布二○二六年的電費調整。經與政府蹉商後，中華電力有限公司和青山發電有限公司（中電）表示由二○二六年一月一日起，將會下調其平均淨電費2.6%至每度電140.6仙；而香港電燈有限公司（港燈）則表示將會下調其平均淨電費2.2%至每度電163.3仙。

環境及生態局局長謝展寰在今日的記者會表示，政府的電力供應政策是要確保市民能夠享有安全、可靠、環保及價格合理的電力供應，所以政府一直努力按《管制計劃協議》嚴格把關。經多番磋商後，兩電最終同意下調明年一月的平均淨電費。基本電費方面，中電亦同意調低於五年發展計劃下預測明年的基本電費，而港燈就與預測水平一致。

謝展寰說：「按兩電估算，電費調整後，一個每月用電量為275度的典型三人家庭的電費與二○二五年的批准電費率相比，每月會大約少付十元。」

中電總裁羅嘉進表示：「我們期望是次減價能舒緩市民生活開支和中小企營運成本，同時透過中電社區節能基金撥款二億七千萬元，全方位推動社會節能減碳、支援弱勢社群、為香港經濟注入更多動力。雖然地緣政治仍為燃料價格帶來不確定性，我們會繼續透過多元化的燃料組合，竭力控制燃料成本，同時審慎理財及利用創新科技，提升營運效率，繼續提供可靠、環保且價格合理的電力服務。」

港燈董事總經理鄭祖瀛表示：「港燈多年來一直致力為香港提供安全、可靠和潔淨的電力供應。我們透過審慎規劃，根據資產折舊周期或設備的實際狀況，持續更新部分已達到或超越設計使用壽命或可用時限的設備，在維持穩定可靠的電力供應的同時，避免不必要的資本投資。為應對日益嚴重的網絡攻擊威脅，亦需提升資訊科技系統抵禦攻擊的能力。這些資本投資難免對電費造成壓力，但由於燃料價格目前相對平穩，燃料調整費將會下調，令港燈明年的淨電費較今年一月份有所下降。」

謝展寰說：「雖然明年一月的平均淨電費會有輕微下調，但從環保的角度，我們鼓勵市民建立綠色生活的習慣和選用能源效益高的產品，可以進一步減少電費支出，亦幫助減少碳排放和保護環境。政府推行的強制性能源效益標籤計劃涵蓋十一種產品，並已於二○二五年九月起全面提升冷凍器具、洗衣機及儲水式電熱水器的能源效益要求。該強制性能源效益標籤計劃每年可額外節省約2.7億度電，相當約80 000個三人家庭的每年用電量。市民可到政府設立的『全民節能』網站參考『節能小貼士』，了解更多節約能源的方法，齊齊實踐『智慧用電』。」"

港燈董事總經理鄭祖瀛表示：「港燈多年來一直致力為香港提供安全、可靠和潔淨的電力供應。我們透過審慎規劃，根據資產折舊周期或設備的實際狀況，持續更新部分已達到或超越設計使用壽命或可用時限的設備，在維持穩定可靠的電力供應的同時，避免不必要的資本投資。為應對日益嚴重的網絡攻擊威脅，亦需提升資訊科技系統抵禦攻擊的能力。這些資本投資難免對電費造成壓力，但由於燃料價格目前相對平穩，燃料調整費將會下調，令港燈明年的淨電費較今年一月份有所下降。」

謝展寰說：「雖然明年一月的平均淨電費會有輕微下調，但從環保的角度，我們鼓勵市民建立綠色生活的習慣和選用能源效益高的產品，可以進一步減少電費支出，亦幫助減少碳排放和保護環境。政府推行的強制性能源效益標籤計劃涵蓋十一種產品，並已於二○二五年九月起全面提升冷凍器具、洗衣機及儲水式電熱水器的能源效益要求。該強制性能源效益標籤計劃每年可額外節省約2.7億度電，相當約80 000個三人家庭的每年用電量。市民可到政府設立的『全民節能』網站參考『節能小貼士』，了解更多節約能源的方法，齊齊實踐『智慧用電』。」"
勞工及福利局局長就失業率及立法會換屆選舉便利投票措施會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-11-18 18:40,2025-11-18 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800749.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十一月十八日）下午出席「賽馬會護老導航照顧者支援計劃」研討會後，就失業率及立法會換屆選舉便利投票措施會見傳媒的談話內容：

勞工及福利局局長：很多謝大家今天來到這裏出席「賽馬會護老導航支援計劃」研討會，聽聽賽馬會支援的幫助護老照顧者的一系列計劃，取得相當好的成果。大家有什麼問題？

記者：局長，政府剛剛公布了最新八至十月的失業率，大概是3.8%，與上季數字相差不多，是否預期未來的失業率數字會有些反覆？

勞工及福利局局長：今日政府剛公布了最新八至十月的失業率。大家可看到失業率較上一季度公布的數字輕微下跌了0.1個百分點，不同界別的分項數字均有所跌幅。大家關心的餐飲業，由上一季度的6.8%下跌0.4個百分點至6.4%。我們預期隨着香港的經濟穩健發展──大家都見到最近一個季度的經濟增長相當理想──我們相信隨着香港的經濟的擴充和行業上良好的勢頭，會為就業市場帶來支撐。當然，我們也明白有部分行業仍在面對轉型期的挑戰，這方面我們也會密切留意。

記者：另外，想問問有關選舉的問題。知道政府會向長者中心和殘疾人士地區支援中心發放20,000元資助，讓他們安排專車接載選民。現時是否所有中心都申請了資助，可否透露確實申請數字及預期整體的開支數字？

勞工及福利局局長：一如二○二三年區議會一般選舉的安排，上次我們為參與的長者中心提供20,000元資助，該次參與率是90%。這次我們同樣邀請全港216間長者中心，再加上21間殘疾人士地區支援中心，總數是237間中心，我們為參與的中心提供一次性20,000元資助。我們今天剛收到回覆，全部237間長者中心和殘疾人士地區支援中心均表示會參與今次的活動，會領取20,000元津貼，方便它們為中心用家及他們的照顧者提供各種便利投票的措施，讓有權投票的人士在12月7日可以履行他們的公民權利，當日投下神聖的一票。

記者：院舍外展投票站會涵蓋哪三個地點? 實際上如何運作? 如何確保不會有人被強制去投票?

勞工及福利局局長：具體的地點和位置要留待選舉管理委員會公布，我可以告訴大家，三間分別一間在香港島、一間在九龍區、另一間在新界區──意味着香港、九龍、新界各自有一個點──當然每個點裏不只一間院舍，有些點有多間院舍。我們的原則是票站所設之處絕不影響院舍運作的地方，可能是禮堂或公用地方，都是移轉空間來的，絕對不會影響院舍運作，整個設置是為了方便住在該處的院友，以及在該處上班的人士，他們認為在該處投票會較方便，可以便利他們到這三個新設的中心點，投下他們神聖的一票。"
再錄得一宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-11-18 18:35,2025-11-18 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800729.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月十八日）接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案，再次敦促學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的14歲男童。他於十一月十四日出現抽搐，到基督教聯合醫院急症室求醫，需留院治理。他昨日（十一月十七日）出現頭暈、發燒及咳嗽帶痰。他的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發肺炎及休克，目前情況嚴重。

男童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗。他的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵，他就讀的學校近日亦沒有爆發流感。

計及上述個案，今個夏季流感季節至今已錄得19宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括兩宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎11個月至17歲。若單單計算在本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃展開後錄得的10宗個案，只有一人曾在發病前四天接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。然而接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，換言之，這些嚴重個案的兒童都未能受到疫苗保護。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然最新的監測數據顯示，流感活躍程度在十月最後一周開始回落，但仍然處於較高水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除流感活躍程度仍可能會有反覆，加上明年初或會出現冬季流感季節，因此我再次呼籲所有年滿6個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動。對比今年初冬季流感季節，今季兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案較多。目前，18歲以下兒童中，6個月至2歲以下兒童的覆蓋率相對偏低，只有近16%，希望各位家長不要遲疑，請盡快聯絡自己家庭醫生為子女，以至自己和其他家人安排接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

"Ombudsman commends government departments, public organisations, professional teams and public officers for efforts to foster administrative innovation and good governance and calls on public to vote in Legislative Council General Election (with photos)",2025-11-18 18:30,2025-11-18 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800532.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

  At the 28th Presentation Ceremony of The Ombudsman’s Awards today (November 18), the Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, presented the Gold, Silver and Bronze Awards for Public Organisations to the Housing Department (HD), the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), and the Correctional Services Department (CSD), respectively. He also honoured the Transport Department (TD) with the Award on Mediation, the Drainage Services Department (DSD) with the Information Technology Application and Creativity Award, and the Digital Policy Office (DPO) with the Customer Services Award. Additionally, 10 teams were recognised with the Team Awards, and 80 public officers received the Individual Awards.

  Addressing the ceremony, Mr Chan shared the Office of The Ombudsman’s record-breaking accomplishments across all three strategic focuses he introduced last year, and extended his sincere appreciation to all relevant government departments and public organisations for their active co-operation and collaboration. This year, following the completion of several direct investigation operations into livelihood issues, which have drawn widespread public concern and significant attention from the Government, the Office is poised to surpass last year’s achievements. Furthermore, it will actively leverage the Hong Kong International Ombudsman Academy to foster innovation and drive positive changes in public administration, advocate the concept of “maladministration prevention”, and continue to strengthen ties and exchanges with international ombudsman bodies. These initiatives aim to showcase the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)’s distinctive advantage of having strong support from the motherland and close connection with the world while telling good stories of Hong Kong.

  The HD received the Gold Award this year. Despite its heavy workload in handling public rental housing applications, tenancy matters and estate management, the HD has been earnest in responding to the Office’s inquiries. Its efficient staff have contributed a lot to many successful mediation cases, demonstrating a strong commitment to service. The HD has shown particular concern for cases involving the elderly and people in need, working closely with the Office to resolve public concerns promptly and effectively. These efforts reflect its people-oriented approach and unwavering commitment to enhancing public administration.

  The FEHD was recognised for its outstanding performance in food safety, environmental hygiene and public health. It responds promptly to public complaints and actively implements the Office’s recommendations for improvement. The FEHD also takes the initiative to participate in the Office’s mediation efforts, striving to resolve public complaints more swiftly and effectively. Moreover, it has embraced innovative technologies to enhance service efficiency, illustrating a positive and forward-looking service mindset.

  The CSD has proactively introduced innovative initiatives, including a chatbot and the Approved Hand-in Articles e-Ordering Service, to enhance penal management and convenience for the public. It also offers a diverse range of rehabilitation and education programmes to support persons in custody and rehabilitated individuals in reintegrating into society. The CSD adopts a proactive and positive approach to complaint handling, delivering comprehensive and timely responses, which is commendable.

  The TD, recipient of the Award on Mediation this year, resolved 74 cases by mediation in 2024-25. Its staff responded promptly and communicated clearly, exemplifying a balanced approach that is lawful, practical and empathetic throughout the mediation process. Such practices led to satisfactory resolutions and earned the TD high praise from the Office for its exemplary performance in promoting mediation.

  The DSD was honoured with the Information Technology Application and Creativity Award for its dedicated in-house development of smart drainage systems to address challenges posed by extreme weather. Among its notable achievements, the Mosaic Model Map effectively predicts the flood risks of all districts throughout the territory, thereby enhancing emergency response capabilities. The system was recognised at the 50th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva this year, underscoring the DSD’s excellence in technology application and creativity.

  The DPO received the Customer Services Award. Operated by the DPO, the 1823 Contact Centre provides 24-hour customer service. Last year, it processed 7.55 million cases using artificial intelligence and excelled itself across all key performance indicators. 1823 has actively adopted innovative technologies to further streamline service workflows and is committed to delivering professional, courteous and efficient service at all times.

  This year, the Office introduced a new Team Award to not only recognise professional teams that have demonstrated excellence in enhancing public administration but also foster stronger connection and team spirit. A total of 10 teams received the Team Awards, including three involving interdepartmental collaboration. In addition, the Individual Awards were presented to 80 distinguished public officers. At the ceremony, Mr Chan praised the awardees, saying, “I am very pleased to see more public officers being commended. This is both a testament to their efforts and contributions and a showcase for continuous progress in public services.”

  In his final remarks, Mr Chan underscored the significance of the eighth Legislative Council General Election, noting its pivotal role in supporting the HKSAR Government’s actions in policy formulation and implementation and driving economic development and improvement of people’s livelihood. He stressed that as the independent watchdog, the Ombudsman is obliged to communicate an important message to 106 departments and organisations subject to the Office’s jurisdiction: Public officers, as the backbone of the governance team, should set an example and cast votes in the elections to fulfil their civic responsibility. The Ombudsman and all his staff fully support the election. He urged all members of the public to support the election wholeheartedly and all voters to vote on December 7. He also wished that every colleague present would motivate their families and friends to fulfil their civic responsibility by casting a precious vote for the HKSAR’s good governance, economic vibrancy and public well-being, as well as the full implementation of the principle of “patriots administering Hong Kong”. Mr Chan expressed his sincere appreciation to all winning organisations and public officers for their united efforts in advancing the quality of public administration.

  A full list of this year’s Individual Award recipients and citations for the winning teams (Chinese only)can be found in Appendices 1 and 2, respectively."

李家超歡迎Joseph E Stiglitz教授和Michael Spence教授來港出席「中國經濟運行與政策」國際論壇2025，分享對環球、國家和香港經濟發展的見解。李家超表示，很高興兩位學者對香港的發展前景感到樂觀，認同香港在教育和創科等領域擁有顯著優勢，並支持特區政府提出的不同策略部署，包括分散投資和拓展新興市場，同時深化粵港澳大灣區協同發展，把握好大灣區的發展機遇。

李家超說，香港在「一國兩制」下擁有國家機遇和國際機遇的雙重疊加優勢，會繼續發揮內聯外通的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」角色，全面融入國家發展大局，主動對接粵港澳大灣區建設。香港是粵港澳大灣區中心城市和區域發展核心引擎之一，特區政府會繼續深化與大灣區不同城市互聯互通，全力提升人流、物流、數據流、資金流，進一步鼓勵和支持企業和人才把握大灣區的發展機遇。

李家超表示，香港是全球最自由經濟體，匯聚全球資金與優秀人才，在最新公布的《全球金融中心指數》報告中，繼續位居全球第三、亞太區第一。香港同時是全球唯一擁有五間百強大學的城市，在最新公布的《2025年世界人才排名》中，香港排名升至全球第四，是歷來最高排名。特區政府正積極建設北部都會區大學城和推廣「留學香港」品牌，進一步發展香港成為國際專上教育樞紐和國際高端人才集聚高地。

李家超說，當前世界百年變局加速演進，面對全球經濟不確定性，特區政府正持續發掘新增長點，其中全速發展的北部都會區是香港經濟發展新引擎，擁有巨大發展潛力和經濟價值，為香港創造更多職位和提升生產力。特區政府同時大力發展創新科技、人工智能和相關產業，積極推進河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區發展，推動教育、科技、人才一體化發展，全力建設國際創新科技中心，為國家高質量發展貢獻更大力量。"
​勞工及福利局局長為「賽馬會護老導航照顧者支援計劃」研討會主禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-11-18 18:22,2025-11-18 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800717.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十一月十八日）為「賽馬會護老導航照顧者支援計劃」（計劃）研討會主禮的致辭全文：

胡家驃先生（香港賽馬會董事）、聶德權教授（計劃諮詢委員會召集人）、樓瑋群教授（計劃首席研究員、香港大學秀圃老年研究中心總監及社會工作及社會行政學系教授）、各位社福界的朋友、以及今日參與的各位人士：

我很高興今日能出席「賽馬會護老導航照顧者支援計劃」（計劃）研討會。數算一下，去年五月計劃的啓動禮雖如在眼前，轉眼間已有成果。十分感謝香港賽馬會、聶德權教授、香港大學，以及所有參與的社福界好友，這麼快就做到一個以數據為本為實證基礎的研討會。

剛剛胡家驃表示，我們已進入一個老齡化社會，大家都知道，在座可能也有不少長者，香港每四個就有一個65歲或以上的長者，這意味着照顧者已經不是一個很特殊的群組。其實環顧四周，很多本身都是照顧者，過往我們很少提到照顧者這個概念，我們更多注意是有需要人士、有需要組群，但過去數年，照顧者這三個字慢慢就進入了我們的詞彙，社會上也是越來越關心照顧者。政府和賽馬會是合作夥伴，當然是有些分別的，政府是做一些恆久化的工作，而賽馬會是更加好的，它們很多時會先行一步，進行一些先行先試計劃，亦會投入大量資源，這方面政府和賽馬會之間的合作就取得很好的成果。

容許我用一些時間賣廣告，其實大家都知道的，但我也提一提，包括政府做了三年的照顧者運動，這看似只是談及照顧者，但我們覺得要令社會對照顧者有重新理解，同時要改變照顧者自己的價值觀和心態，不要覺得做照顧者就是這樣，不要怨亦不要呼救，其實照顧者也要照顧好自己，這是第一點。第二就是我們有照顧者資訊網，這方面很多謝樹仁大學幫我們建立；以及大家已經很熟悉的電話號碼，就是24小時照顧者支援專線182 183，若照顧者遇到任何困難，隨時可致電這個號碼。而賽馬會亦有護老導航照顧者支援計劃，這令到整個支援照顧者的措施更加豐富。此外，《施政報告》亦有提及，政府已預留了五億元特定資源進一步支援照顧者，我認為這一切都標誌着我們正朝着一個正確的方向行走。

今日的研討會，我認為有數個重點看似是技術性的問題，但剛剛聶德權教授亦提到，我覺得很重要的是數據為本， 但只是數據為本是不足夠的，這是一個一體化整體的系統，集中了一些數據，你們稱為「一卡通」，將數據集中一齊，我覺得這是十分重要的，政府都會朝着這個方向去做。如果數據是散開的話，第一，我們未能進行分析，第二就像是明明它是一些寶石、黃金來的，但卻得物無所用。但如果我們有一個統一的平台、統一的數據模式進行分析的話，不單是可以做到更精準的分析，更可以讓我們找到有需要的人士，以及對怎樣可以再改進服務能提供更多的幫助。其實政府一直進行相關工作，政府已經在《個人資料（私隱）條例》（《私隱條例》）下找到合適方案，在符合《私隱條例》的要求下，政府內部數據和醫院管理局（醫管局）的數據都已經互通，只要符合《私隱條例》下關於與健康掛鈎的數據我們都正在進行整合。即我們在做醫社合作的同時，政府內部的數據也進行了互通，這對我們幫助很多，就是用數據去尋找一些我們認為是風險高的，無論是護老者或是要照顧殘疾人士的照顧者，這對我們的工作是大大有所提升的。我們基本上有信心用數據找到大量照顧者出來，這亦意味着我們的挑戰已經由尋找照顧者，變成是怎樣可以對照顧者提供幫忙，令到找出來的高風險、有困難的照顧者能得到適切幫忙，這方面我們一定要攜手努力向前，賽馬會做的工作是為我們提供了一些實證為本的可行性，我熱切期待大家一會兒的分享。

除了要祝研討會取得圓滿成功之外，我亦要做兩個呼籲，一個是關於明日、後日天氣轉冷，所以各位照顧者，無論是你自己還是被照顧的對象，請大家確保要保暖。第二，我和胡家驃一樣，這段時間一定會說一個最重要的信息，這裏大家都是社福界不同界別的，請大家記住十二月七日出來立法會投票。我們已經做了實事，每一個長者中心、殘疾人士地區支援中心都會有兩萬元的津貼，方便大家、其實很多是照顧者，我都很高興向大家透露，剛剛我上車之前知道，所有的長者中心、所有的殘疾人士地區支援中心，都已經登記了會拿這兩萬元津貼，這意味着所有有需要的家庭都會得到適切的照顧，確保在十二月七日，大家可以好好履行你們的公民責任，多謝大家。"

The Forum marks a significant milestone, inviting three prominent local universities' think tanks as co-organisers: Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, HKUST Li & Fung Supply Chain Institute, and the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy, HKU Business School. The Forum brought together more than 20 experts, academics, business leaders and government officials from overseas, the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong to deliver presentations, integrating the latest dynamics and trends of global transformations, examining the impacts and challenges faced by the global economy, and focusing on key topics such as the nation's economic development strategy during the 15th Five-Year Plan period, sustainable development models for regional economic co-operation in the world, and how Hong Kong can enhance its international competitiveness and contribute to future global economic development in the evolving landscape.

Philip H Knight Professor Emeritus of Management, Graduate School of Business, Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and Nobel Memorial Prize laureate in Economic Sciences Professor Michael Spence also delivered a special address.

 Mr Lee said, ""Our country is solidly on a path of high-quality development, creating a stable platform for global growth. As part of this national endeavour, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is proud to contribute its unique advantages, which also enable us to play a critical role in global economic transformations. Under the 'one country, two systems' principle, Hong Kong enjoys the dual advantage of having both national and global opportunities. In these times of economic uncertainty, Hong Kong, as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder', builds bridges for a world of mutual opportunity, offering a market-friendly business environment. We are working now, proactively, to align ourselves with the 15th Five-Year Plan, fulfil Hong Kong's responsibilities and seize the plentiful opportunities there for us.""

Renowned speakers from the United States, Europe, ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong and across the globe have been invited. This initiative serves a dual purpose: to deepen international exchanges and co-operation for local think tanks, thereby enhancing their global influence; and to explore international and national economic development trends, uncovering Hong Kong's unique advantage as a bridge connecting the Chinese Mainland and the world. This will accelerate Hong Kong's integration into and contribution to the broader National Development landscape.""

The Forum marks a significant milestone, inviting three prominent local universities' think tanks as co-organisers: Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, HKUST Li & Fung Supply Chain Institute, and the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy, HKU Business School. The Forum brought together more than 20 experts, academics, business leaders and government officials from overseas, the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong to deliver presentations, integrating the latest dynamics and trends of global transformations, examining the impacts and challenges faced by the global economy, and focusing on key topics such as the nation's economic development strategy during the 15th Five-Year Plan period, sustainable development models for regional economic co-operation in the world, and how Hong Kong can enhance its international competitiveness and contribute to future global economic development in the evolving landscape.

 The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, and member of the Leading Party Members' Group and Secretary-General, Chinese Academy of Social Science, Dr Zhao Zhimin, delivered welcoming remarks at the Forum. Columbia University Professor and Nobel Memorial Prize laureate in Economic Sciences Professor Joseph E Stiglitz and the Head of the CEPU, Dr Stephen Wong, took part in a fireside chat. Philip H Knight Professor Emeritus of Management, Graduate School of Business, Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and Nobel Memorial Prize laureate in Economic Sciences Professor Michael Spence also delivered a special address.

 Mr Lee said, ""Our country is solidly on a path of high-quality development, creating a stable platform for global growth. As part of this national endeavour, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is proud to contribute its unique advantages, which also enable us to play a critical role in global economic transformations. Under the 'one country, two systems' principle, Hong Kong enjoys the dual advantage of having both national and global opportunities. In these times of economic uncertainty, Hong Kong, as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder', builds bridges for a world of mutual opportunity, offering a market-friendly business environment. We are working now, proactively, to align ourselves with the 15th Five-Year Plan, fulfil Hong Kong's responsibilities and seize the plentiful opportunities there for us.""

Remarks by S for Health at media session on latest progress of establishment of new medical school (with photo/video),2025-11-18 18:11,2025-11-18 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800602.htm,"Following are the remarks made by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, at a media session on the latest progress of the establishment of the new medical school today (November 18):

Reporter: First, I would like to ask about what set UST apart from the other two contenders in setting up the third medical school in Hong Kong? Was the university rankings or academic performances also taken into account when deciding which school to be put forward for the ExCo to approve? Secondly, you also mentioned that UST will first have its medical school in Clear Water Bay starting from the 2028 intake. Can you also explain why UST, or the Government, sees the needs to first have the transitional arrangement, instead of having the school be set up in the Northern Metropolis?

Secretary for Health: As I have emphasised, the criteria for making this decision to let Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (UST) build our third medical school is based on a basket of criteria, 10 major criteria, and it is a holistic assessment. It is not based on one single criteria. The UST has a lot of important advantages in terms of, for example, their innovative strategic positioning and building up of clinical scientists. Their university ranking is certainly one of the matters that we considered, as we see the UST has a more global outlook. The financial model that they proposed is more in line with the policy of having a matching in our subsidy in this important venture.

About the reason for having an interim campus in Clear Water Bay, the Ngau Tam Mei site would not be ready by the year of 2028, which is the proposed year for the initiation of the medical curriculum for the UST, so we have to have an interim campus for teaching. The Ngau Tam Mei campus would likely be ready in around 2034 to 2035, so we have to rely on the interim campus for teaching for the time being.

Also, because the teaching hospital in Ngau Tam Mei would not be ready for quite a while, we will need to rely on some other teaching hospitals which are actually included in the proposal by the UST, and this is also the reason that we have to seek the support from the Hospital Authority (HA), which is the main healthcare service provider taking care of about 90 per cent of people in Hong Kong. At present, the two universities also rely on the HA hospitals for teaching, and students are actually sent to different hospital clusters for learning, so we will co-ordinate with the Hospital Authority to support the new medical school's clinical teaching.

(Please also refer to the Chinese portion of the remarks.)"

環境及生態局局長在環境及生態局與兩間電力公司舉行的二○二六年電費調整記者會開場發言（只有中文）,2025-11-18 17:50,2025-11-18 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800687.htm,"以下是環境及生態局局長謝展寰今日（十一月十八日）在環境及生態局與兩間電力公司舉行的二○二六年電費調整記者會的開場發言：
​
各位市民，傳媒朋友，大家好！

今日我們向大家報告二○二六年電費調整的檢討結果。

政府的電力供應政策是要確保市民能夠享有安全、可靠、環保及價格合理的電力供應，所以政府一直努力按《管制計劃協議》嚴格把關。

我們為市民把關的工作不是今年於檢討才做。我們前年審核兩電的五年發展計劃時我們已開始把關，審核兩電在計劃中所建議的資本項目的需要性、進行新項目的時間及預算是否合理。我們只接納在香港實際需求下，絕對有必要的資本項目建議，目的就是將電費盡量壓縮。

今年，在每年一次的電費調整的檢討中，政府同樣嚴格審核兩電的電費建議。在五年計劃的背景下，我們主要審核兩電預測的售電量，因為售電量會對價格有直接影響。我們亦審核兩電的營運開支和燃料價格的估算是否合理，務求盡量調低電費。經多番磋商後，兩電最終同意下調明年一月的平均淨電費。基本電費方面，中電亦同意調低於五年發展計劃下預測明年的基本電費，而港燈就與預測水平一致。

按兩電估算，電費調整後，一個每月用電量為275度的典型三人家庭的電費與二○二五年的批准電費率相比，每月會大約少付10元。

同時，政府亦要求兩電繼續動用其社區節約能源基金提供補助，盡量減低電費對弱勢社群及中小企的壓力。

雖然明年一月的平均淨電費會有輕微下調，但從環保的角度，我們鼓勵市民建立綠色生活的習慣，和選用能源效益高的產品，可以進一步減少電費支出，亦幫助減少碳排放和保護環境。政府推行的強制性能源效益標籤計劃涵蓋11種產品，並已於二○二五年九月起全面提升冷凍器具、洗衣機及儲水式電熱水器的能源效益要求。該強制性能源效益標籤計劃每年可額外節省約2.7億度電，相當約80 000個三人家庭的每年用電量。市民可到政府設立的「全民節能」網站參考「節能小貼士」，了解更多節約能源的方法，齊齊實踐「智慧用電」。

長遠而言，為穩定電費，政府會繼續探討多項措施，包括加強區域合作和推動能源效益及節約能源。

接着我會邀請兩間電力公司，先是請中電，然後請港燈，就二○二六年電費調整的檢討結果作介紹。"
