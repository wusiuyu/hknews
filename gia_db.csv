政府在今年六月完成修訂《汞管制條例》，以落實《關於汞的水俁公約》締約方大會第四次會議上通過的修正案，逐步淘汰對人類健康或環境構成危害的添汞產品，減少公眾接觸這些添汞產品的機會，以保障公眾健康及保護環境。

環境保護署（環保署）發言人說：「在《條例》修訂生效後，相關受規管添汞產品的製造、進口、出口及供應將被禁止。任何人違反以上規定，即屬犯罪，一經定罪，最高可判處罰款五萬元及監禁一年。」

新措施下，政府為新增受規管添汞產品的供應設定寬限期（不適用於相關產品的製造及進出口）至二○二九年一月。在寬限期後，若有人繼續供應相關受規管添汞產品，當局會在收集到足夠證據後作出檢控。

為協助業界了解新管制要求，環保署早前已發信通知相關受規管添汞產品的進出口商及銷售商等持份者，詳細說明新管制的執行細節，以及到訪向持份者作解說。

相關資料已上載至環保署專題網頁（www.epd.gov.hk/epd/tc_chi/international_conventions/mercury/mco.html）。如就新修訂之《汞管制條例》有任何查詢，可致電2838 3111或電郵（enquiry@epd.gov.hk）與環保署聯絡。"
New control on regulated mercury-added products to take effect on December 31,2025-12-23 12:00,2025-12-23 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/23/P2025122300238.htm,"  The control for newly regulated mercury-added products under the newly amended Mercury Control Ordinance (Cap. 640) will take effect on December 31, 2025, covering eight newly regulated mercury-added products (see Annex).

  The Government completed the amendments to the Mercury Control Ordinance in June this year to implement amendments adopted at the fourth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Minamata Convention on Mercury to gradually phase out mercury-added products that are harmful to human health or the environment, so as to reduce the opportunities of the public's exposure to these mercury-added products for safeguarding public health and protecting the environment.

  An Environmental Protection Department (EPD) spokesman said, ""Once the amendments to the Ordinance come into effect, the manufacture, import, export and supply of the relevant regulated mercury-added products will be prohibited. Anyone who contravenes the above regulations commits an offence and, upon conviction, is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and imprisonment for one year.""

  Under the new measure, the Government has set a grace period for the supply of newly regulated mercury-added products (not applicable to production, import and export of the related product) until January 2029. After the grace period, if anyone continues to supply the relevant regulated mercury-added products, the authorities will initiate prosecution after collecting sufficient evidence.

  To help the trades understand the new control requirements, the EPD has earlier written to stakeholders, including importers, exporters and distributors of the concerned mercury-added products, to detail the implementation specifics of the new controls, and has conducted visits to stakeholders to provide guidance.

  Relevant information has been uploaded to the EPD's dedicated website (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/international_conventions/mercury/mco.html). For any enquiries regarding the newly amended Mercury Control Ordinance, please contact the EPD at 2838 3111 or via email at enquiry@epd.gov.hk."

創新科技及工業局局長會見傳媒談話內容,2025-12-22 22:24,2025-12-22 22:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200800.htm,"創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（十二月二十二日）出席港深創新及科技園開園典禮後，聯同創新科技及工業局常任秘書長暨港深創新及科技園有限公司（港深創科園公司）董事會主席蔡傑銘，以及港深創科園公司行政總裁馬惟善會見傳媒。以下為孫東教授和蔡傑銘的談話內容：

創新科技及工業局局長：各位市民、各位傳媒朋友、下午好。剛才我們非常高興與行政長官和各位嘉賓一同見證了深港科技創新合作區香港園區正式開園。這標誌着過去一年多來在行政長官的領導下，河套香港園區的發展開始邁入新里程。今年正值國家「十四五」規劃的收官之年，同時也是「十五五」規劃謀篇布局之年。在這樣一個非常重要的歷史時刻，河套香港園區開園意義重大。這不僅代表了香港積極融入和服務國家發展大局的擔當，更是香港在國家科技創新戰略中積極作為貢獻國家的重要實踐。

河套香港園區佔地87公頃，連同鄰近的新田科技城210公頃的創科用地，是未來香港「南金融、北創科」的關鍵部分。未來河套香港園區將採用「科研+中試」的發展模式，集中聚焦一些比如生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人、新能源以及高端智能製造等前沿科技領域，希望積極吸引海內外的龍頭企業在這裏建立研發中心和中試生產線，為支持企業從研發到試產的全流程。

目前已有超過60間來自本地、海內外的企業，與河套香港園區簽約並且正在陸續的入駐。這些企業看中的是河套香港園區獨特的區位優勢、即將試行的專屬跨境流動政策，以及未來粵港澳大灣區所帶來巨大的潛力和發展的機遇。香港具有內聯外通的獨特優勢，未來河套香港園區將積極幫助內地企業「走出去」，同時吸引海外企業借河套園區「引進來」，充分的發揮新質生產力的引擎作用，同時在這裏匯聚全球的創科資源。

園區的未來工作除了加速餘下五座大樓的建設，力保在二○二七年開始陸續落成之外，從明年開始我們會推出第一期餘下的土地，希望借助市場的力量，與政府一起加快園區建設。園區第二期的規劃已經完成，我們會選擇時間公布。未來河套香港園區第一期、第二期將會提供合計200萬平方米的樓面面積，提供將近10萬個就業職位，希望整個園區運作後能夠為將來的香港GDP（本地生產總值）貢獻千億港元。

河套香港園區將會以今日的開園作為新起點，要充分發揮「一國兩制」的優勢和「一河兩岸」的地利，全速推進園區的建設，同時深化與河套深圳園區的合作，立足將河套園區打造成國際級產學研平台，具有國際競爭力的中試產業轉化基地，為國家高水平科技自立自強、建設科技強國貢獻香港力量。

記者：想問一問有關跨河連接橋的項目，預計何時會完工？這個工程開支是多少？如何與深圳園區分攤開支？預計可以讓多少特定的人員過境？有哪些特定的人員可以過境？孫東局長在網誌提到，園區剩下的建設需要2,000億元才可以完成，政府在引入社會資本參與建設方面，目前有沒有困難？之後會否推出新政策吸引資本？謝謝。

創新科技及工業局局長：大家看到我們河套園區連接深圳園區和香港園區的西部的橋，今天已經開始正式啓動。這橋是由深圳與香港方面共同設計，主要由深圳方面負責施工，費用由兩方共同承擔。我們希望在未來一年以內，爭取在二〇二七年或者之前，這橋能夠建成。關於第二個問題，2,000億元開支問題，這是按照我們現在規劃的一個估計，大概整個成本需要2,000億元。但這2,000億元絕不是完全由政府承擔，我想大部分我們是需要借助業界的力量，這是為甚麼我們常任秘書長（常秘），也是河套香港園區主席，以及我們園區行政總裁，過去這段時間做了大量的工作。之前我們也做市場意向調查，主要是為了招商引資，借助市場的力量，共同發展河套。我想關於下一步我們怎樣發展河套餘下的土地，我想由我們的常秘，也是我們河套園區的主席蔡傑銘先生作介紹。

創新科技及工業局常任秘書長：或者就着局長所說，我都補充一下我們未來投資的方向。今日大家看到河套香港園區的開園，即是它的誕生，第一期第一批次三幢樓已經落成，開始入伙。當然，它受到業界的歡迎，我們入園的情況很熱烈，也很好，但這只是第一個階段。像剛才局長提及，我們第一期第一批次餘下的五幢大樓將會在二〇二七年陸續發展好。五幢樓加上現在已經興建好的三幢，即我們大家都身處的其中一幢，共八幢樓，是由政府公帑出資興建的，我們將這些注入港深創科園公司，以租賃的方式，去招租、去引資。但如果以這個方式去發展，我們覺得是做不到我們剛才所說的「只爭朝夕」，我們既要加快河套香港園區的發展，包括第一期的餘下地塊，又或者甚至是第二期，絕對是需要一些創新模式，公私營合作是絕對需要，不會再是說由政府出所有錢去發展一些園區。相反，我們會透過更多市場力量，特別是希望吸引到不論是外國或是國內一些可能是國企、民企等等，可以來投資、合資，可以用不同方式。港深創科園這間公司就等於一間第一層平台公司，我們可以再發展下去有其他合作模式，包括是怎樣合作投資、公私營合作，將剛才我們一些新的地方，其實某程度上都已經是熟地，大家在外面都見到那些土地已經平整好，隨時可以起樓。我們是希望借助市場力量加快河套香港園區的發展，即將新田科技城的發展，就是河套香港園區的自然延伸，我們也會以同樣的態度和方式，盡量引入更多私人市場的資本。當然，也要配合特區政府一些啓動資本或者啓動工程，去提供一些公用工程、基礎建設，但我們希望園區的發展會更加多用私人力量、私人市場的資金、資源和其人才資源等等去建造。

記者：先問有關河套一些現場配套情況，見到附近有些食肆、餐廳或商店已經啓用，可否告知目前數量和營運情況？剛才行政長官提到人才公寓開始有人入住，現在有多少人和甚麼類型的人士入住？這是第一個問題。另外，想了解現時有超過60間企業進駐園區，這些企業有多少是本地、內地和海外，分布的情況？它們最主要涉及甚麼業務，是設立辦公室還是真的會有研發工作？最後想問關於人流、物流、資金流和數據流這「四流」的情況，今日正式開園，以往一段時間都在討論怎樣去爭取一些便利措施，有否最新情況？

創新科技及工業局局長：關於第三個問題「四流」——人流、物流、資金流、信息流。「四流」一直是河套園區軟件建設最核心的部分，因為河套園區發展中，剛才常秘也說了，我們最主要一定要有國際吸引力，要有競爭力。除了地理上它有一些先天的優勢，地理上橫跨兩種社會制度、經濟和司法體系，這個獨特的性質之外，政策非常重要。所以過去這段時間，我們跟中央有關部委，還有跟廣東省、深圳市都做了緊密的溝通。

目前可以說，在人流、物流和信息流方面都取得了很大的進展。比如說，在人流，我們未來要建兩座小橋，第一座橋現在已經正式開工，我們希望在未來一年內能夠完成把兩個園區的人先通起來，通起來兩個園區就活了。信息、數據流和一些物流方面，物流難點主要是在生物樣品的跨境，我們現在跟內地有關機構已經基本達成共識，我們具體的執行方案已經確定下來。我們希望在明年合適的時候，特別是在園區的公司開始營運之後，能夠盡快推出。應該說在這個方面，無論在數據還是在生物樣品方面，國家都是給香港一些特殊政策。在數據方面，我們一些政策比國內的自貿區還要好，就是說我們的一些數據跨境流動。當然，這個對我們園區也提出更高的要求，就是這些生物樣品、這些敏感數據來了之後，園區一定要把它管好。現在我們就希望在園區內試行，經過實踐階段，如果我們做得好，（國家開放）的口子就會越開越大，在河套這方面就會享受更多的便利。我們希望通過「四流」未來的落實，能讓河套有更大吸引力和發展。

記者：首先想問一下剛才提到的人才公寓有多少戶，或者有多少個位置提供？現在雖然暫時未入住但已簽約的人才大概有多少？即是佔入住率多少？另外，兩座已經落成的濕實驗室的研究領域主要是做哪一方面科研？即是生物醫學或是AI？有沒有分類？第二期的發展方向主要是甚麼？會否與生物科技有關？

創新科技及工業局局長：人才公寓我就代行政總裁答了。我們第一座人才公寓已經建成，有99個房間，另有一間供傷殘人士使用的無障礙房間，現在有一部分人已經開始進駐了。我也希望未來我們記者朋友有機會去參觀。關於現在8、9號樓的研究領域，剛才我也談到，我們現在進入的領域主要來自生命健康、人工智能、新能源、微電子，還有一些高端智能製造等等，很多企業都是把研發跟生產放在一起。比如剛才儀式中海辰介紹到的情況，它就是研發跟生產放在一起，它一下租了40 000呎樓面面積做生產。剛才另外一個做機器人公司元化智能，也是把研發跟生產放在一起。所以今後就是我剛才說的，河套香港園區的發展模式就是R&D，就是研發加上中試，這就是整個河套園區發展重要的定位。就第二期，我們很快就會公布，基本都完成了，大體的發展模式應該說跟第一期是大同小異，也是按照不同的板塊去發展。當然第二期，我們也可能會考慮在生命健康方面會有所側重，因為現在那個地方是有應急醫院，應急醫院在其他地方發展，而在這個地方，我們也希望在原址能夠建現代化的醫學大樓，能夠在醫學研究方面能夠有更大的支持。

Pest Control Steering Committee reviews follow-up work at Tsing Yi Nature Trails in preventing chikungunya fever and discusses next year's work plan in mosquito and rodent control (with photos/video),2025-12-22 22:22,2025-12-22 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200774.htm,"âThe interdepartmental Pest Control Steering Committee (PCSC) held its 22nd meeting today (December 22) to review in details the follow-up work in preventing chikungunya fever (CF) at Tsing Yi Nature Trails (the Trails) by departments and stakeholders. It also discussed the 2026 work plans in mosquito and rodent control, to assist departments in formulating corresponding prevention and control measures in areas under their purview in the coming year.

Prevention and control of CF

The PCSC, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH), the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), various departments and relevant stakeholders have been conducting comprehensive territory-wide vector surveillance and mosquito control work for dengue fever and CF to reduce the risk of transmission of these mosquito-borne diseases. Upon receiving notification from the CHP of cases involving related mosquito-borne disease, the FEHD will take immediate follow-up actions including:


Initiating surveys of mosquito infestation within 24 hours in areas within a 250-metre radius of the residence and workplace of the patient, as well as places the patient had visited during the incubation and infectious period. Relevant Government departments will be notified of the results for follow-up actions;
Implementing larvicidal control measures in the target area and conducting fogging operations in nearby adult mosquito habitats to eliminate adult mosquitoes;
Providing professional advice and technical support to assist relevant departments and stakeholders in formulating and implementing effective mosquito control measures swiftly;
Inspecting construction sites and private residences, and taking enforcement actions against violations related to mosquito breeding;
Visiting schools and childcare facilities in the target area to provide information and assistance regarding mosquito prevention and elimination; and
Enhancing publicity work through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations and distributing publicity leaflets.


Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Trails or the surrounding area, the FEHD has promptly allocated resources to carry out targeted actions in the area upon receiving notifications on November 13 of the first case involving a patient who had visited the Trails and reported mosquito bites. The FEHD has continuously applied a combination of methods to eliminate vector mosquitoes. In addition to ultra-low volume knapsack sprayers to eliminate adult mosquitoes, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed at suitable locations, and a robot dog has been put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has been collaborating with related departments (including the Kwai Tsing District Office, the District Lands Office of Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing, the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) and the Drainage Services Department (DSD)) and stakeholders in eliminating mosquito breeding grounds and potential sites with mosquito problems. Efforts include clearing discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water and applying larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has also started a trial to use drones in identifying mosquito breeding grounds and set up new mosquito trapping devices to control and reduce vector density. At the same time, the FEHD has conducted inspections in the area, initiating prosecution and issuing statutory notices requiring the elimination of stagnant water to responsible persons at construction sites and residential premises found with mosquito breeding or water accumulation. The FEHD has also distributed pamphlets to residents of nearby housing estates, urging the public to remain vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites.

The Kwai Tsing District Office, the District Lands Office of Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing, the CEDD and the DSD have respectively strengthened efforts in areas under their purview along the Trails in eliminating potential mosquito breeding grounds.

In addition, following liaison by the Government, a land owner has removed unauthorised structures placed by a third party on his private land, in order to prevent the spreading of CF.

At present, the FEHD has installed temporary mosquito traps at the Trails to monitor the effectiveness of the measures and the mosquito situation. The FEHD is reviewing the coverage of the survey area of gravidtrap for Aedes albopictus in the Tsing Yi North, and will in due course include the Trails within the survey area.

The FEHD will continue to actively explore the use of drones and stairlifts to assist in fogging operations for eliminating adult mosquitoes. If the relevant technologies (including robotic dogs, drones and stairlifts) are proven effective in enhancing operational efficiency, the department will consider extending their application to other densely vegetated areas as appropriate.

Mosquito control

The representative of the FEHD reported to the PCSC the situation of mosquito proliferation in 2025. Mosquito infestation in 2025 was generally under control, and the overall trend of the gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus is similar to that in the previous years. A relatively high index was recorded from May to July 2025. In May 2025, six investigation areas recorded indices exceeding the alert level of 20 per cent (i.e. level 3 or above), a decrease compared to 10 areas in May 2024. In June 2025, only two areas recorded indices reaching the alert level, a significant decrease from eight areas in June 2024. In July 2025, only one area recorded an index reaching the alert level.

Entering 2026, it is expected that the gravidtrap index will begin to rise along with warmer weather and the rainy season like previous years. The FEHD and relevant departments will step up mosquito prevention and control work. Other than continue eliminating mosquito breeding grounds, larvicides will be applied and fogging operations will be carried out to eliminate adult mosquitoes. New mosquito trapping devices will be also placed at suitable locations. The FEHD will also continue to conduct on-site inspections with relevant departments, and provide them with professional advice and technical guidance. Various departments will closely monitor the situation regarding mosquito-borne diseases and the results of surveillance indices, constantly updating the list of mosquito infestation blackspots to adjust and plan their work in accordance with the actual situation, to ensure that mosquito prevention and control work is prompt and effective.

The Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology and the Chairperson of the PCSC, Miss Diane Wong, specifically reminded various departments to be well-prepared and take proactive mosquito control actions, including the early elimination of potential mosquito breeding grounds before the rainy season, as well as the conduction of fogging operations in a timely and concerted manner until the rainy season ends in order to mitigate risks.

Rodent control

The FEHD reported to the PCSC a series of targeted rodent prevention and control measures under the Cross-sectoral Territory-wide Anti-rodent Action, including continuous overnight anti-rodent operations and the effective use of appropriate anti-rodent technologies and tools. Regarding live rodents, the FEHD has collected approximately 115 100 live rodents between January and November 2025, representing an increase of around 45 per cent from approximately 79 400 rodents in the same period in 2024. When both live and dead rodents are counted, the FEHD has collected a total of approximately 140 800 rodents between January and November 2025, marking an increase of around 28 per cent from approximately 110 100 rodents in the same period in 2024.

In the meeting, the FEHD introduced the utilisation of the Rodent Absence Rate data to assist in formulating targeted measures to further enhance the effectiveness of rodent prevention and control. In addition, the FEHD has also continued to carry out strategic rodent control actions at 93 major rodent blackspots, and reallocate resources to comprehensively and continuously mitigate rodent infestation in the relevant blackspots. It is estimated that the target of reducing the number of blackspots by 60 per cent can be achieved by the end of 2025.

The FEHD also reported to the PCSC the implementation of the Anti-rodent Charter after its launch on December 31, 2024. As of December 15, 2025, a total of 684 residential premises have signed the Charter, covering approximately 650 000 households. Two premises, with over 40 households, that signed the Charter are participants of the Pilot Scheme on ""Joint Property Management"". Other participants joining the Pilot Scheme will be gradually invited to sign the Charter when they are ready.

At the meeting, the FEHD also reported the latest situation regarding the rodent infestation at Dock Street, Hung Hom, and the ongoing rodent prevention and control work. Since the end of November, a total of 31 live and dead rodents have been captured or collected at the site. Meanwhile, the Kowloon City District Office has removed the flower pots found to be infested with rodents, to eliminate their hiding places. In addition, the FEHD has stepped up street cleansing services in the vicinity and installed Internet Protocol cameras at the site to collect information on malpractices, further combating illegal refuse dumping activities. The site will also be included in the Rodent Activity Survey for 2026, in accordance with established criteria and priorities. Miss Wong reminded that co-operation of stakeholders from various sectors, promoting residents' awareness on environmental hygiene and encouraging residents to cultivate good habits are vital to create a rodent-free environment. The Environment and Ecology Bureau will continue to co-ordinate the Cross-sectoral Territory-wide Anti-rodent Action to promote cross-sector, multidisciplinary and community involvement to comprehensively control rodent together.

Miss Wong urged at the meeting all departments to closely monitor situation of mosquito proliferation in areas identified as high risk, and strengthen mosquito prevention and control work in areas under their purview. She stressed that, given the characteristic of vertical transmission of the virus, and the fact that mosquito eggs can still hatch into adult mosquitoes when the rainy season and warmer weather arrive, it is therefore of utmost importance for everyone to continue their efforts in the coming months to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds. Regarding the work plan of mosquito and rodent control in 2026, Miss Wong emphasised departments should formulate mosquito and rodent control measures at the soonest in areas under their purview, as well as proactively consolidating mosquito and rodent control work with various sectors and encouraging the public to collaborate in mosquito and rodent control actions.

The meeting today was chaired by Miss Wong. Government bureaux, departments and organisations attending the meeting were the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department; the Architectural Services Department; the CEDD; the Development Bureau; the DH; the DSD; the Education Bureau; the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department; the Environmental Protection Department; the FEHD; the Government Property Agency; the Hospital Authority; the Home Affairs Department; the Housing Department; the Highways Department; the Information Services Department; the Lands Department; the Leisure and Cultural Services Department; the Marine Department; the Social Welfare Department; and the Water Supplies Department."
Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-22 22:15,2025-12-22 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200847.htm,"The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3.8 billion as of noon today (December 22). With the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $4.1 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

The Government is providing a $100,000 living allowance from the Support Fund to each affected household. As of today, 1 935 cases have been processed. Families of each deceased victim will be provided with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 146 cases have been processed. In addition, the Government earlier announced three new measures, providing to flat owners at Wang Fuk Court a grant of $100,000; an annual rental grant of $150,000 (to be provided for two years) and a one-off relocation grant of $50,000; as well as a one-off relocation grant of $50,000 for affected tenants. The allowances will be disbursed in phases.

Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 980 affected households, and more than 4 900 residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government.

Medical support
--------------------

The Health Bureau co-ordinated with various dental care organisations, the Hong Kong Dental Association, and dentists to launch free denture replacement and dental treatment services tomorrow (December 23) to assist affected residents in need. Currently, more than 80 private dentists have participated in the free consultation services, covering 106 service points. Starting from tomorrow until February 28, 2026, all residents of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers) can receive at least one free dental consultation and one follow-up appointment (subject to clinical need) through the arrangement of the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses under the Primary Healthcare Commission across all 18 districts in Hong Kong. The scope of the free dental consultation services covers two major categories: (1) broken appliances and lost dental appliances due to the incident (including repair or replacement of partial or complete dentures (acrylic), and removable orthodontic retainers); and oral treatment due to injuries inflicted in the incident (including medication for dental pain relief, simple fillings, emergency pulp treatment and extractions).

Accommodation support
---------------------------

Currently, there is still a supply of more than 1 000 units that can provide affected residents with longer-term accommodation. The transitional housing and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) projects in different districts can altogether provide around 500 units at the moment. Moreover, Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun and Runway 1331 at Kai Tak can provide a supply of around 900 units.

As of this morning, a total of 516 residents are staying in hotel rooms through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, and 568 residents are staying in youth hostels/camps. Another 3 513 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau, units from the HKHS, or Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 2 000 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, over 45 000 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Investigation and regulation
-------------------------------

The Fire Services Department (FSD) announced on December 16 that it has stepped up inspections and encouraged industry to inspect fire service installations and equipment (FSIs). In response to the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, the department has maintained close collaboration with relevant property management organisations and stepped up inspections of FSIs in buildings since December 4, with a view to enhancing building fire safety. To address public concerns regarding the performance of building fire alarms, stakeholders have agreed to promote voluntary fire alarm testing to safeguard public safety.

In addition, the FSD has redeployed manpower internally to enhance inspections of FSIs in buildings, particularly those undergoing major maintenance, and has proactively inspected the functional status of fire alarms. Should any non-compliance be identified, the department will conduct thorough investigations and decisively take enforcement actions. At the same time, the department has redeployed personnel to promptly follow up on reports of abnormal operation of FSIs in buildings and will take appropriate enforcement actions accordingly.

The FSD earlier held a meeting with the Association of Registered Fire Service Installation Contractors of Hong Kong to discuss the proper arrangements for FSIs during major renovation works. In fact, the FSD Circular Letter No. 1/2021 has already stipulated that when carrying out the works, the contractor concerned should adopt a systematic approach in shutting down the affected FSI by phases and resume its normal operation as soon as practicable. If the affected portion of the system could not be reinstated to normal working condition by the end of a working shift, arrangements should be made for the portion to be isolated with the remainder of the system to be reinstated. The trade expressed its full support and indicated its willingness to implement the relevant measures in accordance with the statutory requirements and guidelines. In response to a commentary published by a media outlet which does not fully reflect the facts, the FSD made a clarification today to set the record straight."
DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-12-22 21:56,2025-12-22 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200770.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (December 22) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From December 14 to 20, the CHP recorded four community-acquired LD cases. All of the patients involved had underlying illnesses. The details of the cases are as follows:


a 70-year-old male patient living in Sai Kung District;
an 84-year-old female patient living in Wan Chai District;
a 77-year-old male patient living in Wong Tai Sin District; and
a 61-year-old male patient living in Sai Kung District. The patient passed away on December 17.


âThe CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that these are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

âAdditionally, the CHP continues to follow up a previously announced LD case where hospital-acquired transmission cannot be ruled out. Given that the patient had stayed in the community and was hospitalised at St. Paul's Hospital during the incubation period, apart from conducting investigation at St. Paul's Hospital, the CHP earlier collected a total of 14 water samples from the residence of the patient concerned. After testing by the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the CHP, eight samples tested positive for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 at levels ranging from 0.1 to 37.3 colony-forming units per millilitre (cfu/ml). Two of these samples were at levels 17.8 and 37.3 cfu/ml respectively, exceeding the action level for water supply systems in community buildings(i.e. 10 cfu/ml or above). Among five environmental samples collected from the patient's residence, one sample also tested positive. The CHP has provided health advice to family members of the patient, and instructed the property management company to thoroughly disinfect the relevant water system.

 Since samples collected at both the residence and the ward in St. Paul's Hospital tested positive for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, the CHP considered that both St. Paul's Hospital and her residence are possible to be the source of infection. However, as the bacterial load of the patient's sample was low, genetic analysis was not performed successfully, hence the exact source of infection could not be ascertained.

In response to the positive results of the water samples upon testing, as a precautionary measure, St. Paul's Hospital is continuing to close and suspend use of the wards on the floor concerned in accordance with the CHP's instructions. The hospital will also thoroughly disinfect the water supply system on that floor as instructed by the CHP. The CHP will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the measures and conduct epidemiological investigations.

The CHP has completed medical surveillance for the 28 patients who were admitted to the same hospital floor since mid-November. No LD cases have been identified among them.

As of December 20, 161 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpool spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or ships.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpool spas, water fountains, humidifiers and home respiratory devices that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.

â
âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) or less and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

Dr Chui met with the District Officer (Tsuen Wan), Mr Billy Au, the District Officer (Kwai Tsing), Mr Edric Leung, the Acting District Officers (Sham Shui Po), Miss Stella Wong and Miss Agnes Chan; and around 40 members of District Council from the three districts. They reviewed the progress in improving water quality and odour along both sides of Victoria Harbour, particularly in Tsuen Wan, Kwai Tsing and Sham Shui Po. On-site demonstrations were given of innovative multi-dimensional monitoring technologies across sea, land, and air platforms, including an ""Artificial Intelligence Environmental Air Nuisance Investigation Robot Dog"" (AI Dog), ""Ground Penetrating Radar"", ""Drone for Sampling and Monitoring"", and ""Unmanned Sampling Boat"", etc. The attending councillors gave highly positive feedback on the environmental improvements in the relevant areas.

Dr Chui said, ""The 2022 Policy Address set a target of reducing by half the pollution load from seriously polluted outfalls along Victoria Harbour, including areas such as Tsuen Wan and Sham Shui Po, by the end of 2024 while Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing districts also share the same water body. Through a series of source control measures and the application of innovative technologies, the reduction of pollution load significantly exceeded the target. By the end of last year, the overall pollution load at the relevant stormwater outfalls was reduced by nearly 90 per cent. Today, no noticeable odour was detected at the Tsuen Wan and Cheung Sha Wan waterfronts, indicating a remarkable improvement in the environmental conditions along the coastal areas of these three districts.""

Over the past three years, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has proactively used innovative technologies in identifying and rectifying sewer misconnections to improve nearshore odour problems along Victoria Harbour. By the third quarter of this year, EPD teams had inspected over 5 000 manholes and tested more than 1 200 water samples in Tsuen Wan, Kwai Tsing, and Sham Shui Po districts, identifying 191 pollution cases equivalent to pollution load from 300 000 people. Through inter-departmental collaboration, the total pollution load from outfalls in Tsuen Wan and Sham Shui Po districts has been reduced by nearly 90 per cent, leading to substantial improvement in nearshore odour. Hydrogen sulfide monitoring devices installed at the Tsuen Wan and Sham Shui Po waterfronts indicated that the average concentrations have decreased from the previous 36 parts per billion (ppb) and 18 ppb, respectively to currently both below 5 ppb (see photos).

Dr Chui thanked the three District Councils for their affirmation of the EPD's work and their valuable opinions. He concluded, ""We will continue to leverage smart technologies, work closely with District Councils, and harness community wisdom to jointly build greener, healthier and more liveable communities."""
環保署署長聯同三區區議員視察　近岸水質顯著提升獲肯定（附圖）,2025-12-22 21:03,2025-12-22 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200707.htm,"環境保護署（環保署）署長徐浩光博士今日（十二月二十二日）聯同荃灣、葵青、深水埗三個區議會議員進行實地視察，了解荃灣、葵青和深水埗地區沿岸水質及氣味改善的成果。

徐浩光博士與荃灣民政事務專員區家盛、葵青民政事務專員梁乘龍、深水埗署理民政事務專員王懿詩和陳樂桐，以及荃灣、葵青、深水埗三區共約40位區議會議員會晤，回顧就治理維港兩岸，特別是荃灣、葵青及深水埗地區沿岸水質及氣味改善的成果，並於現場演示了海陸空全方位的立體監測創新儀器，包括「AI偵查機械狗」、「探地雷達」、「採樣監測無人機」及「無人採樣潛水艇」等。出席議員均對相關地區的環境改善給予非常正面的評價。

徐浩光博士表示：「二○二二年《施政報告》提出將維港兩岸包括荃灣及深水埗等地區有嚴重污染問題的排水口，在二○二四年年底前的污染量減少一半，而荃灣及葵青區更共同擁有同一水體。通過一系列源頭治理及創新科技應用，我們已大幅超額完成目標，截至去年底，相關雨水排放口的整體污染量已減少近九成。今天我們在荃灣和長沙灣海濱均未有明顯偵測到異味，該三區沿岸的環境狀況已顯著改善。」

環保署過去三年積極運用創新科技，致力偵測及糾正污水渠錯駁，以改善維港沿岸地區的氣味問題。截至今年第三季，環保署團隊已在荃灣、葵青及深水埗區共檢查超過5 000個沙井，化驗逾1 200個水樣本，共識別191宗污染個案，估計污染量相當於約30萬人口。經跨部門合作，當中荃灣，葵青及深水埗區的排水口總污染量已減少近九成，近岸氣味已得到大幅改善。設置在荃灣及深水埗海濱的氣味監測儀器，顯示硫化氫平均濃度由過往分別36 ppb及18 ppb減到現今均低於5 ppb（見附圖）。

​徐浩光博士感謝三區區議會對環保署工作的肯定及提供寶貴意見，並總結：「我們將持續運用智慧科技，與區議會緊密協作，凝聚社區智慧，攜手打造更綠色、更健康、更宜居的社區。」"
CE officiates at opening ceremony of Hong Kong Park in the Loop,2025-12-22 21:03,2025-12-22 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200746.htm,"  The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, today (December 22) officiated at the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone (Hetao Co-operation Zone). The Hetao Co-operation Zone is one of the four major co-operation platforms among the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area under the National 14th Five-Year Plan. The Hong Kong Park is envisioned to develop into a world-class hub for technological innovation that connects the Chinese Mainland with the international community, and to serve as an important source for fostering and advancing new quality productive forces for the country.

  Speaking at the opening ceremony, Mr Lee remarked that, ""The development objective of the Hetao Co-operation Zone is set out to become a world-class innovation platform. As a major national technological innovation co-operation zone, it spans across two different social systems geographically, leveraging the strengths of the respective economic frameworks and judicial regimes.""

  ""We will continue to drive forward the construction and development of the Hong Kong Park by optimising institutional integration, strengthening policy support, actively attracting high-quality enterprises and world-class research teams, etc. I am confident that the Hetao Co-operation Zone will emerge as a bridgehead and testing ground for Hong Kong's I&T development. It will also become a showcase for pioneering policies within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and across the global innovation landscape. It is a powerful Hong Kong engine for growth.""

  The Hong Kong Park is developed in batches under two phases. Out of the eight buildings in the first batch of Phase 1 development, two wet-laboratory enabled buildings and a talent accommodation building have been completed, providing about 32 000 square metres of floor area and 100 apartment units respectively. Over 60 institutions and enterprises have already begun moving into the wet laboratory buildings, while the talent accommodation welcomed their first batch of tenants this month. Construction works of the foundation and superstructures for the remaining five buildings have commenced and will be completed progressively starting from 2027 onwards.

  Meanwhile, the planning and development layout for the Park's Phase 2 development has been finalised. The two phases together will offer a total floor area of up to 2 million square meters. Functionally, the Park will be divided into different technological zones focusing on pillar industries such as life and health technology, artificial intelligence and data science, new technologies and advanced manufacturing, thereby fostering the integrated development of upstream, midstream and downstream industries and building a comprehensive I&T industry chain.

  To expedite the construction works of the Park, the Park Company has rolled out an expression of interest exercise to gauge the market's interest in selected plots of the remaining land of Phase 1 development, with a view to leveraging market forces to develop the Park in an accelerated and efficient manner. The Park Company received 27 responses and is currently analysing them with a view to preparing for launching the land plots in an orderly manner starting from 2026. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will carefully consider releasing the land parcels to the market through tender or other land disposal models, thereby achieving the objective of making best use of market resources to jointly develop the Park.

  At the ceremony, Mr Lee also announced the official commencement of the ""Western Cross-River Link Bridge Project"" which will connect the two parks in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. This project will open up the transportation network of the Hetao Co-operation Zone, effectively facilitating the cross-boundary flow of personnel and showcasing the advantages of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong boundary facilities and innovative management policies. The two sides will adopt a design concept of integrating the cross-boundary bridge with the surrounding ecological environment and with an emphasis on low-carbon technology, safety and convenience, and a pleasant scenery, as well as adopting a ""single-span across the river"" approach in construction, which will serve as a new landmark to connect the two parks under the concept of ""one zone, two parks"" while creating an innovation network in the Greater Bay Area.

  The Executive Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Xu Qifang, the Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, Mr Zhou Ji, Vice Mayor of Shenzhen Mr Luo Huangho, the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, the Deputy Financial Secretary, Mr Michael Wong, the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, and the Permanent Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry and Chairman of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park Limited, Mr Kevin Choi, also attended the opening ceremony.

  Mr Lee also visited the wet laboratory buildings of the Hong Kong Park to learn about its facilities, environment and the facilitation measures provided for the tenant enterprises by the Park Company. He also exchanged views with representatives of the I&T enterprises which have already set foot in the Park."
衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-12-22 20:59,2025-12-22 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200765.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月二十二日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在十二月十四日至二十日期間，中心錄得四宗社區感染的退伍軍人病個案，四名病人均有長期病患，詳情如下：


70歲男病人，居於西貢區；
84歲女病人，居於灣仔區；
77歲男病人，居於黃大仙區；及
61歲男病人，居於西貢區，他於十二月十七日離世。


​中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這些個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

此外，中心正繼續跟進早前公布一宗不排除屬院內感染的退伍軍人病個案。鑑於該名45歲女病人在潛伏期內曾分別在社區活動及入住聖保祿醫院，中心除在聖保祿醫院進行調查外，早前亦在該病人的住所採集了共14個水樣本，經中心公共衞生化驗服務處化驗後，其中八個樣本對嗜肺性退伍軍人桿菌血清1型呈陽性反應，濃度為每毫升0.1至37.3個菌落形成單位，當中兩個樣本的濃度分別達每毫升17.8及37.3個菌落形成單位，高於社區大廈供水系統的行動水平（即每毫升10個或以上菌落形成單位）。另外，在病人的住所採集的五個環境樣本中，其中一個樣本亦呈陽性反應。中心已向病人家屬提供健康建議，並指示大廈管理公司徹底消毒相關供水系統。

鑑於在病人住所及其入住的聖保祿醫院病房內採集的樣本經化驗後均對嗜肺性退伍軍人桿菌血清1型呈陽性反應，中心認為聖保祿醫院和其住所皆可能是感染源頭。然而，由於病人樣本的細菌量低，未能成功進行基因分析，因此感染源頭未能確定。
​
因應院內有水樣本經化驗後呈陽性反應，為審慎起見，聖保祿醫院正按中心指示，繼續關閉和停用涉事樓層的病房，並會按中心指示徹底消毒該樓層的供水系統。中心會繼續密切監察院方執行相關措施的情況和進行流行病學調查。中心已完成對自十一月中起入住同一醫院樓層的28名病人的醫學監察，未有發現當中有退伍軍人病個案。

截至十二月二十日，今年錄得161宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池、加濕器和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


​市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米或以下，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及
避免在通風較差的環境工作，如密封的溫室。

防治蟲鼠督導委員會檢視在青衣自然徑的防控基孔肯雅熱跟進工作及討論來年防治蚊患和滅鼠工作計劃（附圖／短片）,2025-12-22 20:30,2025-12-22 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200698.htm,"政府跨部門防治蟲鼠督導委員會今日（十二月二十二日）召開第二十二次會議，詳細檢視各部門及持份者在青衣自然徑的防控基孔肯雅熱跟進工作，並討論二○二六年防治蚊患和滅鼠工作計劃，以助部門在來年制定其範疇下的防控蚊患及滅鼠措施。

防控基孔肯雅熱

委員會、衞生署衞生防護中心、食物環境衞生署（食環署）、各部門及相關持份者一直全方位跟進登革熱／基孔肯雅熱病媒監察及防治蚊患工作，以減低相關蚊傳疾病的傳播風險。在接獲防護中心通報相關蚊傳疾病個案後，食環署會立刻採取跟進行動，包括：


於24小時內啓動對病患者住所、工作地點及於傳染期到過地方的250米半徑範圍內進行蚊患調查，並把調查結果通知相關政府部門，以便作出跟進行動；
於目標範圍一帶進行殺滅幼蟲的防控工作，亦會於附近的成蚊棲息地進行霧化處理以殺滅成蚊；
為相關部門及持份者提供專業意見和技術支援，協助迅速制訂和實施有效的防蚊滅蚊措施；
巡查建築工地及私人住宅，對發現蚊子滋生的違規情況採取執法行動；
到訪目標範圍內的學校和幼兒設施，提供防蚊滅蚊資訊及協助；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張。


特別針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食環署自十一月十三日接獲首次有個案曾前往青衣自然徑並報稱受到蚊叮後，隨即調配資源在該處展開針對性工作，持續混合應用不同方法殺滅病媒蚊子，除了以背負式超低微量噴霧器進行霧化處理以殺滅成蚊外，亦在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。食環署更聯同相關部門（包括葵青民政事務處、荃灣葵青地政處、土木工程拓展署（土拓署）及渠務署）及持份者，協力清除蚊子滋生地及潛在蚊患地點、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署亦試用無人機尋找蚊子滋生地，以及透過設置新型捕蚊器控制及減低病媒密度。同時，食環署在該處一帶巡查，向有蚊蟲滋生或積水的地盤及住宅處所負責人，分別提出檢控及發出法定消除積水通知書。食環署亦向附近一帶的屋苑居民派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施防止被蚊叮咬。

葵青民政事務處、荃灣葵青地政處、土拓署及渠務署在青衣自然徑亦加強其範疇的行動，務求清除潛在蚊子滋生地。

此外，經政府聯繫後，業權人已把第三方在其私人土地上放置的未經批准構築物移除，以杜絕傳播基孔肯雅熱。

現時，食環署在該處設置了臨時誘蚊器，以監測措施成效及蚊患情況。食環署正檢視青衣北地區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器調查的覆蓋範圍，並會適時將青衣自然徑納入調查範圍內。

食環署將繼續積極探索使用無人機及電動爬梯機，以協助進行霧化處理殺滅成蚊的工作。若相關科技選項（包括機械狗、無人機及電動爬梯機）證實有助提升工作成效，當局會視乎情況，考慮將有關科技的應用範圍擴展至其他植被茂密的地區。

防治蚊患

食環署代表向委員會匯報二○二五年整體的蚊患情況。二○二五年的蚊患情況整體受控，白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數整體趨勢與往年相若，二○二五年五至七月錄得相對較高的誘蚊器指數。二○二五年五月記錄到六個調查區域的誘蚊器指數超過20%的警戒級別（即3級或以上），與二○二四年五月的10個區域相比有所下降。二○二五年六月，僅記錄到兩個調查區域的誘蚊器指數達到警戒級別，與二○二四年六月的八個區域相比顯著下降。二○二五年七月，僅記錄到一個調查區域的誘蚊器指數達到警戒級別。

踏入二○二六年，預計誘蚊器指數會如往年隨着天氣回暖及雨季來臨而開始上升。食環署與相關部門會加強防蚊滅蚊工作，除了繼續清除蚊子滋生地外，亦會於有需要的情況下施放殺幼蟲劑及以霧化處理方式殺滅成蚊，並於適當位置設置新型捕蚊器等。食環署亦會繼續聯同相關部門進行實地視察，向他們提供專業意見及技術指導。各部門亦密切留意相關蚊傳疾病的情況及監測指數的結果，持續更新蚊患黑點清單，以便因應實際情況調整和部署，確保防蚊滅蚊工作迅速及有效。

環境及生態局副局長兼委員會主席黃淑嫻特別提醒各部門必須作好準備，積極採取滅蚊行動，包括在雨季前及早清除蚊子的潛在滋生地，以及適時同步啓動霧化工作至雨季結束，以減低風險。

防治鼠患

食環署向委員會匯報，在「各界滅鼠行動」下部門採取一系列針對性防治鼠患措施，包括持續進行夜間滅鼠行動，以及善用適當滅鼠技術和工具等。就活鼠而言，食環署在二○二五年一至十一月共檢獲約115 100隻活鼠，較二○二四年同期檢獲約79 400隻增加約45%。若活鼠連同死鼠一同計算，食環署在二○二五年一至十一月共檢獲約140 800隻活鼠及死鼠，較二○二四年同期檢獲約110 100隻增加約28%。

食環署在會上介紹如何運用「無鼠百分比」的數據，協助制定針對性措施進一步提升防治鼠患的效能。此外，食環署持續針對93個鼠患主要黑點進行策略性滅鼠行動，調撥資源，務求全面及持續改善有關黑點的鼠患，預計可在二○二五年年底前達成將黑點數目減少六成的目標。

食環署亦向委員會匯報《滅鼠約章》（《約章》）在二○二四年十二月三十一日推出後的情況，截至二○二五年十二月十五日，共有684個住宅處所簽署《約章》，涵蓋約65萬住戶。當中，有兩個是「聯廈聯管」試驗計劃的參與者，涵蓋逾40個住戶。當其他「聯廈聯管」的參與者準備就緒，將會獲邀簽署《約章》。

食環署在會上亦匯報了紅磡船澳街鼠患的最新情況及持續進行防鼠滅鼠工作。自十一月底，食環署在該處捕獲的活鼠及檢獲的死鼠合共有31隻。同時，九龍城民政事務處已將有關發現鼠患的花盆移走，以除去老鼠匿藏地點。此外，食環署亦已加強上址附近一帶的街道潔淨服務，並已在該處安裝網絡攝錄機，收集違規行為的資料，進一步打擊該處非法棄置垃圾情況。食環署更會按既定準則及優次將該處納入二○二六年鼠隻活動調查的監察範圍。黃淑嫻提醒要締造一個無鼠環境，各界持份者齊心協力及提高居民對保持環境衞生的意識並養成良好的習慣至關重要，環境及生態局會繼續統籌「各界攜手，全港滅鼠行動」，推動跨界別、多專業及市民共同採取措施，攜手全面防治鼠患。

黃淑嫻在會上促請政府各部門密切留意已識別為高危地方的蚊患情況，並在其管轄範疇內加強防蚊滅蚊工作。她強調，考慮到病毒跨代傳播的特性及蚊卵稍後在雨季來臨及天氣回暖時仍可孵化成蚊，故此大家在這數月繼續努力清除蚊子滋生地至為重要。就二○二六年防治蚊患和滅鼠工作計劃，黃淑嫻強調部門應盡快制定來年其範疇下的防控蚊患及滅鼠措施，並繼續積極聯同各界鞏固防治蚊患及鼠患的工作，以及鼓勵市民配合防治蚊患和鼠患行動。

DH reminds public to stay vigilant against infectious diseases while enjoying the coming winter holidays,2025-12-22 20:15,2025-12-22 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200723.htm,"âThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (December 22) reminded the public to practise strict personal, food and environmental hygiene as well as get seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) early to guard against some common and travel-related infectious diseases, regardless of staying in Hong Kong or travelling abroad during the coming Christmas and New Year holidays.

Seasonal influenza and other respiratory diseases

""The latest surveillance data showed that the local influenza activity remained at a high level. Based on past experience, Hong Kong's winter influenza season typically occurs between January and March. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the local influenza activity will further increase, leading to an overlap of the current influenza season with the winter influenza season early next year. For areas outside Hong Kong, influenza activity has continued to increase or reached a high level in most areas of the North Hemisphere, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Europe, South Korea, Japan and the Chinese Mainland. According to the latest information from the World Health Organization (WHO), a strain of influenza A (H3) virus known as subclade K has been rapidly increasing globally since August of this year. The detection of this virus strain increased in multiple countries and regions worldwide, including Hong Kong. Influenza A (H3) virus belonging to subclade K has been detected in more than 34 countries, but the current epidemiological data does not indicate that this strain causes more severe illness. Preliminary overseas scientific research data indicates that this season's influenza vaccines continue to provide protection to both children and adult, reducing the risk of seeking medical treatment or hospitalisation due to influenza. Although there are some antigenic differences between the currently circulating influenza A (H3) virus strain and the virus strain contained in the vaccine, the SIV can still offer protection against the variant strain of subclade K, as well as the influenza A (H1) and influenza B strains,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

Dr Tsui emphasised that receiving SIV is still one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of hospitalisation and death from infection. Public should receive vaccination as soon as possible regardless of staying locally or plan to travel abroad, as it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body for sufficient protection against influenza virus. Since influenza can cause serious complications, the CHP recommends that all persons aged six months or above receive the SIV, particularly high-risk individuals such as pregnant women, the elderly, children and those with underlying illnesses.

Regarding other respiratory diseases, the COVID-19 activity currently maintains at a low level recorded before April this year. Epidemiological data from local and other regions worldwide shows that there are generally periodic upsurges in the COVID-19 activity level approximately every six to nine months.

""It has been over five months since the last periodic upsurge of COVID-19 activity. Members of the public should receive COVID-19 vaccine in a timely manner to reduce the risk of serious illness and death due to COVID-19. Under the current Government's COVID-19 Vaccination Programme, individuals aged six months or above are eligible for free initial vaccine doses. High-risk priority groups can receive booster doses for free at least six months after the last dose or COVID-19 infection (whichever is later), regardless of the number of doses received previously,"" Dr Tsui said.

Regarding respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the RSV activity started to increase in many regions in North America and Europe. Prevention of RSV infection is the same as that for other respiratory diseases. Members of the public should maintain good personal, hand and environmental hygiene. Public with respiratory symptoms, even if the symptoms are mild, should wear a surgical mask, refrain from going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly. They should maintain hand hygiene before putting on and after removing a mask.

Acute gastroenteritis, norovirus infection and food poisoning

""Norovirus infection typically causes acute gastroenteritis. In general, norovirus is more active in winter (around December to March). As norovirus is highly contagious, individuals may become infected after being exposed to even a small amount of norovirus. The virus can be transmitted through various means, such as eating contaminated food, contacting with the vomit or excreta of infected persons, and contacting with contaminated objects, which may lead to a large-scale outbreak,"" Dr Tsui said.

To prevent acute gastroenteritis and norovirus infection, members of public should perform hand hygiene frequently, especially before handling food or eating, and after using the toilet. Wash hands with liquid soap and water, and rub for at least 20 seconds, then rinse with water and dry with a disposable paper towel or hand dryer. Since alcohol is not effective in killing norovirus, alcohol-based handrubs are not a substitute for handwashing with soap and water.

During the festive season, members of public have more opportunities to have parties with food delivery services or hotpot. To prevent food poisoning, apart from maintaining personal hygiene, they should also consume thoroughly washed and cooked food. For shellfish, the shells should be well scrubbed and the internal organs be removed before consumption. In addition, never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce. Use different chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination. For more food safety tips, please visit thewebpage of the Centre for Food Safety of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.

Mosquito-borne diseases

As of December 18, Hong Kong has recorded 57 dengue fever (DF) cases, all are imported cases. The imported cases were mainly from Indonesia (11), the Philippines (11), India and Thailand (nine each). Besides, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed chikungunya fever (CF) cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported. The patients have visited the Chinese Mainland, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Cuba, Sri Lanka and Mexico.

The WHO information showed that, from January to July 2025, over four million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths have been reported in 97 countries/territories. DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India and Vietnam have each recorded over 100 000 cases so far this year; Malaysia and Thailand have each recorded over 40 000 cases; and Singapore has also recorded over 3 500 cases. Regarding CF, since the beginning of 2025 and as of September 30, over 440 000 CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe.

""Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. Public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries. To prevent mosquito-borne diseases, travellers should wear loose, light-coloured, long-sleeved tops and trousers and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or exposed parts of the body. Travellers returning from areas affected by DF should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong,"" Dr Tsui said.

Measles

 The number of measles cases in some overseas countries has remained at a relatively high level recently. The outbreaks in North America (including the United States and Canada), Europe and neighbouring areas (including Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines) are ongoing due to the relatively low vaccination rate. Furthermore, an increasing number of measles cases have also been recorded in Japan and Australia this year. Hong Kong has recorded eight cases this year. Among them two cases (25 per cent) were classified as imported cases.

Those who plan to travel to places with outbreaks or a high incidence of measles should review their vaccination records and medical history as early as possible. If they have not been diagnosed with measles through laboratory tests and have never received or are not sure if they have received two doses of measles vaccine, they should consult a doctor at least two weeks prior to their trip for vaccination. For people born outside Hong Kong, they should pay special attention as they might not have received a measles vaccination during childhood.

""Pregnant women and women preparing for pregnancy who are not immune to measles or rubella, as well as children aged under one year who are not due for the first dose of the measles, mumps and rubella-combined vaccine under theHong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programmeare advised not to travel to places with outbreaks of measles. The incubation period of measles is seven to 21 days. Symptoms include fever, skin rash, cough, runny nose and red eyes. If such symptoms appear after returning from measles-endemic areas, people should wear surgical masks, stay home from work or school, avoid crowded places and contact with unvaccinated people, especially those with weak immune systems, pregnant women and children under one year old, and should consult their doctors as soon as possible,"" Dr Tsui said.

Relaunch of invitation for quotations on harbourfront event space in Hung Hom for short-term use,2025-12-22 20:05,2025-12-22 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200674.htm,"The Development Bureau (DEVB) announced today (December 22) the relaunch of the invitation for quotations for the short-term use of the Former Hung Hom Railway Freight Yard Pier as harbourfront event space (location plan in Annex). The invitation is open from today until January 22, 2026. The successful bidder shall be responsible for the development, operation, management and maintenance of the said event space while making it available for public enjoyment for approximately three years.

The Pier is currently a vacant site. The DEVB earlier announced the long-term development proposal for sites around the Hung Hom waterfront areas (including the Pier) with a view to transforming these areas into a new harbourfront landmark. The DEVB also indicated that, before the long-term development thereon, the Pier site will be revitalised, as a short-term measure, into a character-filled event space and public open space.

The DEVB had invited open quotations mid-year for the aforesaid short-term revitalisation project. However, in view of the availability of an additional piece of land adjacent to the Pier site, which can be included in the project in one go, and the Government's wish to strengthen the provisions on venue management, the DEVB has decided to cancel the aforesaid quotation exercise and relaunch it after strengthening the relevant terms and requirements.

For the land adjacent to the waterbody to the right of the Pier, it will become part of the event space site, expanding its area from approximately 1.5 hectares to 1.8 hectares.

Furthermore, in response to the incident at the Central Harbourfront Event Space this September regarding the cancellation of the passenger-carrying hot air balloon ride after the sale of tickets due to the failure to secure the relevant permit, the DEVB has beefed up the terms and requirements in the quotation documents to place a heavier onus on the venue operator (i.e. the successful bidder of this quotation exercise) in monitoring future event organisers and to regularise the communication and alert mechanisms so as to enable the DEVB, as the venue owner, to intervene in a timely manner. These strengthened provisions are aimed at better leveraging harbourfront resources to bring positive experiences for visitors as well as to better safeguard consumer rights. Relevant terms and requirements include:

(1) The venue operator is required to assess the credentials and experience of the applicants, their capability in hosting events, the feasibility of the proposed events, etc, before confirming approval of venue applications from event organisers. The venue operator shall submit regular assessment reports to the DEVB;

(2) The venue operator shall closely monitor the progress of event preparation and alert the DEVB in a timely manner, such as whether the event is in alignment with the original proposal, whether the relevant licenses or permits have been applied for and obtained in a timely manner, and whether the ticketing arrangement is proper; and

(3) In addition to the abovementioned alert mechanism, the venue operator and event organisers are required to hold a tripartite meeting with the DEVB prior to the events to confirm the progress of the final stage preparation and the arrangements made.

A two-envelope approach is adopted in this quotation exercise, under which the weighting for the technical proposal is 70 per cent and the price proposal is 30 per cent. Factors for assessing the technical proposals include whether the proposals would involve the hosting of any landmark events or installations, the availability of catering and entertainment facilities, and the development of night-time activities. Details of the quotation exercise are available on the website of the DEVB (www.devb.gov.hk). The DEVB will complete the quotation assessment as promptly as possible after the close of the invitation in January next year. Meanwhile, the Government is carrying out basic improvement works at the Pier and will hand over the Pier to the successful bidder as the venue operator. The Pier is anticipated to be open to the public in phases starting from the first quarter of next year."

With a compassionate mind and a dedication to education, he was held in high esteem by teachers, students and the community. His spirit and ethos are deeply admirable.""

  ""We are grateful for the Most Venerable Jing Yin's contributions to education, and he will always be remembered."""
Remarks by SITI at media session,2025-12-22 19:50,2025-12-22 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200696.htm,"  The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, met the media together with the Permanent Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry and Chairman of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park Limited (HSITP), Mr Kevin Choi, and the Chief Executive Officer of the HSITP, Mr Vincent Ma, today (December 22). Following are the remarks by Professor Sun:

Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry: Today, we are so delighted to join the Chief Executive and a number of distinguished guests in witnessing the official opening of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone. This marks a significant milestone in the development of the Hetao Hong Kong Park with an accelerated pace and enhanced efficiency under the leadership of the Chief Executive.

  This year marks the conclusion of the National 14th Five-Year Plan. Today, the opening of the Hetao Hong Kong Park holds profound significance. This event not only underscores Hong Kong's proactive participation in and contribution to our national strategic development but also serves as a demonstration of Hong Kong's active role and substantial contribution to the national science and technology innovation strategy.

  The Hetao Hong Kong Park covers 87 hectares; together with another 210 hectares of I&T (innovation and technology) land in the San Tin Technopole, it is a key component of Hong Kong's new strategic layout of a South-North dual engine (finance-I&T). The Hong Kong Park will adopt a model of R&D (research and development) plus pilot production, prioritising the development of cutting-edge technologies in certain areas including life and health sciences, medical technology, AI and robotics, new energy and high-end smart manufacturing. The Park will attract leading enterprises to set up R&D centres and pilot production lines, supporting the entire process from R&D to production.

  At present, more than 60 local, Mainland and overseas enterprises and institutions have successfully settled in the Hetao Hong Kong Park. These companies and organisations are attracted by the geographical advantage, forthcoming cross-boundary policy measures and, more importantly, the huge potential and opportunity possessed by the Greater Bay Area (GBA) development. Hong Kongpossesses the unique advantage of connecting Mainland and overseas markets, which can help Mainland companies to go global, at the same time facilitating overseas companies in using the Hetao Hong Kong Park as a springboard to enter the GBA and Mainland markets.

  Moving forward, we will focus on rolling out the remaining land in Phase 1 development and pressing ahead with the planning for Phase 2. We will expedite the construction of the remaining five buildings and make sure all these five buildings will be ready starting from 2027.

  The Hetao Hong Kong Park will take today's opening as a new starting point. Leveraging the strengths of ""one country, two systems"" with the geographical advantage of ""one river, two banks"", we will accelerate collaboration with the Shenzhen Park to build a core engine for regional innovation development. We are now happy to take a few questions from you. Thank you."
FSD clarifies commentary about fire service installation and equipment,2025-12-22 19:48,2025-12-22 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200712.htm,"  In response to a commentary published by a media outlet that the trade doubted whether the suggestion by the Fire Services Department (FSD) to shut down fire service installation and equipment (FSIs) by phrases during building maintenance works is feasible, the FSD today (December 22) made the following clarification to set the record straight, as the media report does not fully reflect the facts.

  According to regulation 7 of the Fire Service (Installations and Equipment) Regulations (Cap. 95B), no person other than a registered fire service installation contractor shall maintain, inspect or repair any FSI in any premises. Any person contravening commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine at level 5 (i.e. $50,000). Any person who is not a registered fire service installation contractor attempts to interfere with FSIs may be in breach of the law. The FSD will follow up stringently.

  Maintenance, repair or inspection of FSIs must be carried out by registered fire service installation contractors, who will exercise professional judgement and carry out the relevant work in accordance with the FSD's instructions. Personnel responsible for building maintenance works have no authority to shut down FSIs. It is an extremely irresponsible behaviour for any frontline personnel to shut down FSIs in order to avoid false alarms triggered by the works.

  In fact, the FSD Circular Letter No. 1/2021 has already stipulated that disruption to the normal operation of FSIs caused by its shutdown should be kept to the minimum. When carrying out the works, the contractor concerned should adopt a systematic approach in shutting down the affected FSI by phrases and resume its normal operation as soon as practicable. If the affected portion of the system could not be reinstated to normal working condition by the end of a working shift, arrangements should be made for the portion to be isolated with the remainder of the system to be reinstated. Upon completion of the relevant works, the contractor shall issue the relevant Certificate of Fire Service Installations and Equipment in due course.

  In respect of the above matters, the FSD earlier held a meeting with the Association of Registered Fire Service Installation Contractors of Hong Kong. The trade expressed its full support and indicated its willingness to implement the relevant measures in accordance with the statutory requirements and guidelines."

Afterwards, Customs officers also seized three suspected gravity-operated steel batons and two suspected controlled air pistols in the man's residential premises. The total estimated market value of the seized items was about $4 million.

A 25-year-old male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Johannesburg, South Africa, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found about 5kg of suspected cocaine concealed in the false compartments of his check-in suitcase. The man was subsequently arrested.

Later, Customs officers further seized three suspected gravity-operated steel batons and two suspected controlled air pistols in the arrested man's residence.

The investigation is ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

消防處澄清有關消防設備及裝置的評論,2025-12-22 18:35,2025-12-22 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200652.htm,"就有傳媒刊登評論指業界質疑消防處建議大廈維修期間，消防設備及裝置應分段關閉安排是否可行。鑑於有關內容未能完全反映事實，消防處今日（十二月二十二日）作出澄清，以正視聽。

根據香港法例第95B章《消防（裝置及設備）規例》第7條，任何非註冊消防裝置承辦商的人，均不得保養、檢查或修理裝置在任何處所內的任何消防裝置或設備。如有違反，即屬犯罪，一經定罪，可處第5級罰款（即50,000元）。任何非註冊消防承辦商的人士如嘗試干擾消防裝置，有機會觸犯法例，消防處必定嚴肅跟進。

消防裝置的保養、修理或檢查必須經由註冊消防裝置承辦商進行，承辦商會作出專業判斷，按消防處的指示進行相關工作。負責大廈維修工程的人員並無權限把消防裝置及設備關閉，若有前線人員為了避免消防裝置因工程誤鳴而企圖將其關閉，屬極之不負責任的行為。

事實上，《消防處通函第1/2021號》已列明，關閉消防裝置對其正常操作的影響應減至最低。承辦商應在大廈有工程進行時採用有系統的方法，將受影響的消防裝置分段關閉，並且盡快恢復其正常運作。如系統的受影響部分在工作更次的尾聲未能恢復正常操作，應把該部分孤立，讓系統其餘部分先恢復正常操作。當完成相關工作後，承辦商須在適當時間內發出相關「消防裝置及設備證書」。

就上述事宜，本處早前已與香港註冊消防工程公司商會舉行會議，業界表示將全力配合，並按法例的指引執行有關措施。"

Strategic Committee on Commodities convenes first meeting (with photos),2025-12-22 18:30,2025-12-22 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200602.htm,"The Strategic Committee on Commodities, chaired by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, convened its first meeting today (December 22).

Mr Chan said, ""Driven by the interplay of several major trends, including the geopolitical situation, technological transformation and green transition, the global supply and demand landscape for commodities such as precious metals, non-ferrous metals, traditional energy and materials related to new energy is undergoing profound changes. As one of the world's major consumers and importers and exporters of commodities, our country is pressing ahead with high-quality development, firmly advancing towards its dual carbon goals, and stepping up investment in green industries. These developments highlight our country's strengths in building a global hub for commodity resource allocation. As an international financial, trade and shipping centre, Hong Kong enjoys the unique advantage of connecting the Mainland and the world under the 'one country, two systems' principle, with the free flow of capital, goods and information, together with its efficient financial, logistics and professional services and a well-connected transport network. Hong Kong possesses enormous potential in developing the commodities market, enabling it to serve and contribute to the development of our country and the world on this front, while creating more diversified development opportunities for itself.

""In the past year or two, Hong Kong has been actively building a more vibrant commodities ecosystem, from joining the global warehousing network of the London Metal Exchange to facilitate physical metal delivery, to expediting the establishment of an international gold trading market, and we have already taken solid steps in this regard. Looking ahead, Hong Kong needs to, through highâlevel government coordination, formulate and implement a comprehensive development strategy for commodities in order to seize future development opportunities.""

He continued, ""The Committee brings together leaders from across the commodities trading ecosystem, including finance, commerce and trade, shipping, logistics and professional services sectors to conduct in-depth and comprehensive research into global commodities market trends, thoroughly review the current landscape and trends in areas such as physical trade, financial and derivative trading, as well as shipping and logistics. It will also study the opportunities for developing businesses of various major and emerging categories of commodities in Hong Kong, enhance market mechanisms and regulatory framework, build an industry ecosystem, and explore mutual market access with the Chinese Mainland. The Committee will also provide specific recommendations on the positioning, development planning and promotion strategy for Hong Kong's commodities market.""

At today's meeting, the Committee received a briefing on global commodities market trends and Hong Kong's development potential, and discussed the categories of commodities and key areas that should be prioritised for in-depth study and discussions.

In the 2025 Policy Address, the Chief Executive proposed the establishment of the ""Strategic Committee on Commodities"" to bring together industry representatives with the aim of strengthening the top-down design and long-term strategy of our commodity policy.

Under the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Motor Vehicle Export Facilitation Scheme, motor vehicle importers/distributors can submit advance information to Hong Kong Customs for pre-arrival notification and apply to relevant departments for a first registration tax concession on electric private cars that meet the eligibility criteria before shipping the vehicles to Hong Kong, thereby significantly enhancing overall logistical efficiency and convenience."
紅磡海濱活動空間的短期用途重新招標,2025-12-22 18:22,2025-12-22 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200622.htm,"發展局今日（十二月二十二日）公布，就前紅磡鐵路貨運碼頭（碼頭）用地發展作為海濱活動空間（位置見附件）的短期用途重新招標。招標期由即日起開始，至二○二六年一月二十二日截止。中標者未來約三年將負責發展、營運、管理和保養該活動空間並開放予訪客享用。

碼頭目前為空置土地，發展局早前公布包括碼頭在內的紅磡海濱地帶的長遠發展建議，把該區打造成海濱新地標，並表示在碼頭用作長遠發展前，先於短期內把它活化為特色活動及公共空間。

發展局於今年中曾為該短期活化計劃進行公開招標，考慮到碼頭毗鄰有額外用地可納入項目，而局方亦希望加入條款強化場地管理，發展局決定取消原有招標，並在修訂條款後重新招標。

活動空間將納入碼頭右邊水體的岸上用地，面積由原先約1.5公頃增至約1.8公頃。

此外，因應今年九月中環海濱活動空間曾發生公開售票後未能取得牌照而取消熱氣球載客升空活動的情況，局方在重新招標文件加入多項條款，強化場地營運者（即是次招標的中標者）對日後活動舉辦方的監察角色，並常規化溝通預警機制，讓發展局作為場地業主適時介入，目的是善用海濱用地為訪客帶來良好體驗，保障消費者權益。相關條款包括：

（1）明確要求場地營運者接納活動舉辦方的場地租用申請前，須先行評估申請者的背景、舉辦活動的能力、活動可行性等，並按時向發展局提交評估報告；

（2）場地營運者需密切監察活動籌備過程，例如活動安排是否符合原先建議、能否如期申領牌照／許可，以至門票出售安排等，並適時通報發展局；及

（3）除上述預警機制外，亦規定場地營運者及活動舉辦方須在開展活動前和發展局舉行三方會議，以便確立最後階段的情況和部署。

是次招標採取「雙信封制」，技術建議的評分比重佔百分之七十，而價格建議佔百分之三十。技術建議的評估因素包括會否提出舉辦地標式活動或裝置、引入餐飲娛樂設施，以及開發夜間活動等。招標詳情請參閱發展局網頁（www.devb.gov.hk）。發展局會在明年一月截標後盡快完成評標工作。與此同時，政府現正在碼頭用地進行基本改善工程，完成後會把用地交予中標的場地營運者，以明年首季起分階段開放給公眾使用。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-22 18:20,2025-12-22 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200604.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 22), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. As the CHP and relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails recently, the CHP continues to appeal to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

  The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm. All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

  Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

  
âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

冬日假期將至　衞生署提醒市民歡度節日仍需防範傳染病,2025-12-22 18:15,2025-12-22 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200600.htm,"​聖誕及新年假期將至，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月二十二日）提醒市民，不論是留港或到外地歡度節日亦要時刻注意個人、食物及環境衞生，並及早接種季節性流感疫苗，以預防各種在冬季較常見或與旅遊相關的傳染病。

季節性流感及其他呼吸道疾病

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「最新的監測數據顯示，本港整體流感活躍程度維持在高水平。根據過往經驗，香港冬季流感季節大多於一至三月出現，因此不排除本地流感活躍程度會進一步上升，以致現時流感季節與明年初的冬季流感季節重疊。香港以外地區方面，北半球大部分地區（包括美國、加拿大、英國、歐洲、韓國、日本及中國內地）的流感活躍程度持續增加或已處於高水平。根據世界衞生組織（世衞）的最新資料，自今年八月起，一種名為亞分支K的甲型（H3）流感病毒活躍程度在全球快速上升，多個國家和地區對該病毒株的檢測數量都有所增加，本港亦然。目前全球已在超過34個國家和地區檢測到屬亞分支K的甲型（H3）流感病毒，但流行病學數據並未顯示疾病嚴重程度有所增加。海外科學研究數據初步顯示，本季使用的季節性流感疫苗繼續對兒童和成人提供保護，減低因流感而需求診或住院的風險。即使目前流行的甲型（H3）流感病毒與疫苗所含的病毒株存在一些抗原差異，季節性流感疫苗仍能對亞分支K的變異病毒株，以及疫苗中包含的甲型（H1）及乙型流感病毒提供保護。」

徐樂堅醫生強調，接種季節性流感疫苗仍然是最有效預防季節性流感及其併發症的方法，亦可減低入院及死亡風險。市民無論在本地或計劃外遊，應及早接種疫苗，因為接種疫苗後身體約需兩星期產生抗體，以對流感病毒提供足夠保護作用。由於流感可引致嚴重併發症，中心建議所有年滿6個月或以上的人士接種季節性流感疫苗，特別是孕婦、長者、兒童及長期病患者等高危人士。

 其他呼吸道傳染病方面，目前新冠病毒的整體活躍程度仍維持在今年四月前的低水平。本地及全球其他地區的流行病學數據均顯示，一般每隔約六至九個月會經歷一次新冠活躍周期。

徐樂堅醫生說：「本港距離上次新冠活躍周期已超過五個月，市民應適時接種新冠疫苗，以減低感染新冠病毒後重症和死亡的風險。現時在政府新冠疫苗接種計劃下，6個月大或以上人士可免費接種初始劑次，而高風險優先組別人士不論過往已接種多少劑疫苗，於接種上一劑疫苗或感染新冠病毒（以較後者為準）最少六個月後，均可免費接種加強劑。」

呼吸道合胞病毒方面，在北美和歐洲多處地區病毒活躍程度開始上升。預防呼吸道合胞病毒感染與其他呼吸道疾病的方法一樣，市民應時刻保持個人、手部和環境衞生。出現呼吸道感染病徵的市民，即使症狀輕微，都應佩戴外科口罩，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，並應盡早向醫生求診，而佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後要保持手部衞生。

急性腸胃炎、諾如病毒感染及食物中毒

徐樂堅醫生說：「諾如病毒常引致急性腸胃炎。一般來說，諾如病毒在冬天（約十二月至三月期間）較為活躍。由於病毒具高度傳染性，受影響人士即使接觸少量病毒，亦有機會受感染。病毒可透過進食受污染的食物、接觸受感染人士的嘔吐物或排泄物，及接觸受污染的物件等不同途徑傳播，有機會導致大規模爆發。」

要預防急性腸胃炎及諾如病毒感染，必須經常保持雙手清潔，尤其在處理食物或進食前及如廁後。洗手時應以梘液和清水清潔雙手，搓手最少20秒，用水過清並用抹手紙或乾手機弄乾。由於酒精未能有效殺死諾如病毒，酒精搓手液不能代替使用梘液和清水潔手。

節慶期間，市民較多機會舉行派對安排食物到會或火鍋，要預防食物中毒，除了注意個人衞生，所有食物亦必須徹底清潔並煮熟後方可食用；處理貝類海產時，須洗淨外殼並去除內臟，才可進食。此外，切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬，並應使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。有關食物安全的更多資訊，可瀏覽食物環境衞生署食物安全中心網頁。

蚊傳疾病

截至十二月十八日，香港今年共錄得57宗登革熱個案，全屬外地傳入個案。外地傳入個案主要從印度尼西亞（11宗）、菲律賓（11宗）、印度和泰國（各9宗）傳入。另外，本港今年累計錄得81宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，當中11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案（患者曾到過中國內地、孟加拉、印度、印度尼西亞、古巴、斯里蘭卡和墨西哥）。

世衞資料顯示，由二○二五年一月至七月，全球97個國家／地區呈報了超過400萬宗登革熱個案及超過3 000宗相關死亡個案。登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點普遍流行，印度尼西亞、印度和越南今年已分別錄得超過十萬宗個案，馬來西亞和泰國亦分別錄得超過四萬宗個案，新加坡則錄得超過3 500宗個案。基孔肯雅熱方面，自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了超過44萬宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案，個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。

徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。要預防蚊傳疾病，市民應穿着寬鬆、淺色的長袖上衣及長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。如從受影響地區返港，應在至少14日內繼續使用昆蟲驅避劑。」

麻疹

近期部分海外國家的麻疹個案仍維持在較高水平，其中北美洲（包括美國及加拿大）、歐洲及東南亞地區（包括越南、柬埔寨和菲律賓），因疫苗覆蓋接種率偏低而持續爆發麻疹。另外，日本和澳洲今年錄得的麻疹個案亦有所上升。香港今年則錄得8宗個案，當中2宗（25%）屬外地傳入個案。

市民如計劃前往出現麻疹爆發或高發病率的地方，應及早檢視自己的疫苗接種紀錄及病歷，若以往未經化驗確診感染麻疹，以及從未或不確定曾否接種兩劑麻疹疫苗，應在出發前最少兩星期諮詢醫生接種疫苗。而非本港出生的市民應特別留意，因其可能未曾在童年接種麻疹疫苗。

徐樂堅醫生說：「懷孕婦女及計劃懷孕婦女若對麻疹或風疹（德國麻疹）沒有免疫力，以及本港未滿一歲仍未適齡在『香港兒童免疫接種計劃』下接種麻疹、流行性腮腺炎及德國麻疹混合疫苗的兒童，不應前往爆發麻疹或風疹的目的地。麻疹的潛伏期為七至二十一日，病徵包括發燒、皮膚出現紅疹、咳嗽、流鼻水和眼紅等。市民如從麻疹流行地區回港後出現相關病徵，應戴上外科口罩，停止上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方和避免與未有免疫力人士接觸，尤其是抵抗力弱人士、孕婦及未滿一歲的兒童，並盡早向醫生求診。」

如欲了解以上各種傳染病的詳情，可參閱衞生防護中心的季節性流感、2019冠狀病毒病、食物中毒、諾如病毒感染、基孔肯雅熱、登革熱及麻疹專頁。此外，計劃外遊的市民可瀏覽旅遊健康服務網，查閱最新的旅遊健康資訊及建議。"

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB) and the Intellectual Property Department (IPD), launched the Intellectual Property (IP) Financing Sandbox today (December 22).

As set out in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"", the IP Financing Sandbox aims to assist pilot sectors in leveraging IP assets for financing.

The Sandbox serves to provide a collaborative and risk-controlled environment for banks, IP valuation firms, legal practitioners and other relevant professions to test the full lifecycle of IP financing arrangements that are based on IP assets such as patents, trademarks and copyrights.

Through the Sandbox, banks can develop and refine their IP financing arrangements with the support from multidisciplinary professionals as well as guidance by the HKMA, the CEDB and the IPD. This initiative can also enable banks to accumulate practical experience in providing IP financing to better serve the needs of innovative enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises which are rich in IP assets but may lack tangible assets that can be pledged as collateral for bank financing.

Three major banks in Hong Kong have joined the Sandbox as inaugural participants, and have solicited interests from clients from the biotechnology, electronics and technology sectors to conduct pilot trials of IP financing through the Sandbox (see Annex)."
LCSD introduces new measures to strengthen efforts to combat touting activities,2025-12-22 17:00,2025-12-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200238.htm,"  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) announced today (December 22) that new measures will be implemented to strengthen efforts to combat unauthorised transfer of bookings of LCSD recreation and sports facilities/venues (commonly referred to as touting activities).

  The new measures are as follows:

(1) Penalties for using computer programmes or automated tools to interfere with SmartPLAY

  To ensure the fair use of the SmartPLAY system, the LCSD will combat improper conduct involving the use of computer programmes or other automated tools to make booking transactions or interfere with the normal operation of the system. Specifically, SmartPLAY has incorporated conditions prohibiting the use of computer programmes or other automated tools to make bookings (www.smartplay.lcsd.gov.hk/website/en/about/conditions-of-use-of-smartplay.html). Starting from January 21, 2026, if users breach the conditions concerned, the LCSD will immediately suspend their accounts for 360 days without giving any prior notice. The LCSD once again reminds users of the need to comply with the ""Conditions of Use of SmartPLAY"", to properly manage the information of their SmartPLAY accounts, and not to disclose their user account numbers and passwords to others. Users having so provided their user account numbers and passwords to a third party are advised to change their passwords as soon as possible and regularly update them to prevent unauthorised use of their accounts.

(2) New measures for booking indoor basketball and volleyball courts

  Currently, a hirer who books turf soccer pitch through SmartPLAY is required to provide the SmartPLAY user account information of four other users. The hirer and three of the users named in the booking are required to check-in together and be present during the use of the booked session. This arrangement, aiming to ensure that hirers are genuine users, is generally effective since implementation. It will apply to indoor basketball and volleyball courts, which are popular facilities, starting from January 21, 2026. A hirer is required to provide the information of two other users when booking an indoor basketball or volleyball court. The hirer and one of the users named in the booking are required to check-in together and be present during use of the booked session. Details are available at the LCSD's thematic webpage ""Improvement measures to booking and use of recreation and sports facilities"" (www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/facilities/facilitiesbooking/procedure/ls_fac_improve.html).

(3) Standby arrangement no longer applicable to indoor basketball and volleyball courts

  Under the existing measures applicable to some recreation and sports facilities, if a hirer does not take up the booked facility 10 minutes after the booked session starts, the LCSD may at its discretion permit other users to use the facility free of charge for the same purpose as the original hirer (commonly referred to as the standby arrangement), on condition that there are no other same-type facilities available for booking at the material time. In this connection, the LCSD has observed that certain hirers of indoor basketball and volleyball courts deliberately do not take up the booked sessions on the day of use, and are suspected to have engaged in touting activities by arranging for other users to use the booked courts under the standby arrangement. To combat such abuse of the standby arrangement, and making reference to the current arrangement for turf football pitches, the standby arrangement will no longer be applicable to indoor basketball and volleyball courts with effect from December 30, 2025.

  LCSD will closely monitor the effectiveness of the new measures, and continue to enhance SmartPLAY as well as implement further anti-touting measures as necessary."

Financing sandbox launched today with opening of Hong Kong Technology and Innovation Support Centre to foster intellectual property financing and innovation,2025-12-22 17:00,2025-12-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200461.htm,"  The Government announced today (December 22) the official launch of the intellectual property (IP) financing sandbox and the opening of the Hong Kong Technology and Innovation Support Centre (HKTISC), marking key milestones in promoting IP financing and further developing Hong Kong's IP trading ecosystem while fostering innovation.

  The Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address the launch of the sandbox to assist pilot sectors (particularly the technology sector) in leveraging IPs for financing with the support of the banking, insurance, valuation, legal and other professions. The sandbox will provide a collaborative and risk-controlled environment for stakeholders to test out the full lifecycle of IP financing and accumulate practical experience in providing IP financing.

  With the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB), the Intellectual Property Department (IPD) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) deliberation, the sandbox is underpinned by the following four core operating principles:

(1) Recognition of IP value: Participating banks will consider the value of IPs owned by borrowing enterprises, alongside the borrower's credit demand, financial position and repayment ability in their credit underwriting process.

(2) Independent and standardised valuation: To ensure credibility, IP valuation will be conducted by independent service providers using universally accepted methods. Where appropriate, qualitative patent evaluation reports can be obtained to support this process.

(3) Risk management: Participating banks should comply with applicable supervisory requirements on risk management, while participating enterprises should comply with the legal and regulatory requirements in respect of maintaining and developing the IP assets concerned.

(4) Stakeholder collaboration: The initiative relies on a cohesive ecosystem. It brings together enterprises that hold IP assets, banks, valuation experts, legal practitioners and other relevant professionals to co-create successful financing transactions.

  The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, said that the IP financing sandbox, together with other related measures announced in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"", would help leverage Hong Kong's unique strengths to build an ecosystem where IP is protected with rigour, valued with clarity, and financed with confidence, with a view to strengthening Hong Kong's role as a regional IP trading centre.

  By enabling enterprises to leverage their IP assets for financing, the sandbox will help unlock a new financing channel, thereby supporting the commercialisation of outcomes of research and development as well as creativity, and promoting innovation and technology as a key driver of economic growth.

Three major banks have committed to participating in the sandbox, while nearly 30 professional firms from the legal and valuation sectors have indicated keen interest in participating. The CEDB, the IPD and the HKMA will closely monitor the progress of the pilot projects, gather feedback, and provide guidance as needed. It is anticipated that several trial cases are in the pipeline for the first phase of the sandbox.

In addition, the HKTISC that officially commenced full operations today is another key complementary initiative in promoting IP financing. With the support of the IPD, the HKTISC will closely engage small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the innovation and technology sector and provide a qualitative patent evaluation service to assess, based on national standards, the quality of their patents from legal, technological and economic perspectives. The Government will also launch a support scheme through the HKTISC in 2026 to financially assist SMEs to engage professional service providers for the valuation of their whole IP portfolios in monetary terms.

These integrated measures aim to provide an objective reference about the strengths of the patents and the monetary valuation of the whole IP portfolios owned by the SMEs, facilitating more effective credit assessment and investment analysis.

​康文署採取新措施加強打擊「炒場」,2025-12-22 17:00,2025-12-22 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200237.htm,"康樂及文化事務署（康文署）今日（十二月二十二日）宣布，將採取新措施，以加強打擊違規轉讓轄下康體設施／場地（俗稱「炒場」）。

新措施內容如下：

（一）使用電腦程式或自動化工具干擾「SmartPLAY康體通」的罰則

為保障公平使用「SmartPLAY康體通」系統，康文署將打擊使用電腦程式或其他自動化工具進行預訂交易或干擾系統正常運作的不當行為。「SmartPLAY康體通」加入了禁止使用電腦程式或其他自動化工具預訂場地的條件（www.smartplay.lcsd.gov.hk/website/tc/about/conditions-of-use-of-smartplay.html），由二○二六年一月二十一日起，如用戶違反有關條件，康文署會暫停其帳戶360日，無須給予任何預先通知。康文署再次提醒用戶必須遵守「SmartPLAY康體通」的使用條件，妥善管理SmartPLAY帳戶資料，切勿向他人透露用戶帳號及密碼；曾將SmartPLAY帳號及密碼提供予第三者的用戶，請盡快及定期更新用戶密碼，以免帳戶被盜用。

（二）預訂室內籃球場和排球場的新規定

現時在「SmartPLAY康體通」預訂草地足球場時，租用人必須填寫另外四名用場人士的資料，並須與其中三人一同簽取場地及於租訂段節在場使用設施，此舉旨在確保租用人是真正用家，實施以來取得一定成效。此措施將應用於廣受歡迎的室內籃球場及排球場，由二○二六年一月二十一日起，租用人在預訂室內籃球場及排球場時，必須填寫另外兩名用場人士的資料，並須與其中一人一同簽取場地及在場使用設施，詳情載於康文署「改善康體設施訂場及使用安排」專題網頁（www.lcsd.gov.hk/tc/facilities/facilitiesbooking/procedure/ls_fac_improve.html）。

（三）「執雞」安排不再適用於室內籃球場和排球場

按現行適用於部分康體設施的措施，租用人如於所租訂的段節開始十分鐘後仍未簽取場地，而當時沒有同類設施可供租訂，康文署會酌情容許其他使用者免費使用未被取場的設施，作與原租用人租場的相同用途（即俗稱「執雞」安排）。康文署注意到有室內籃球場和排球場的租用人故意於用場當天不取場，並安排其他人「執雞」，進行懷疑「炒場」活動。針對上述濫用措施的行為，參考現時草地足球場的相關安排，由二○二五年十二月三十日起，「執雞」安排不再適用於室內籃球場及排球場。

康文署會密切監察新措施的成效，於有需要時會繼續優化「SmartPLAY康體通」，以及推出更多打擊「炒場」的措施。"

知識產權融資沙盒今日推出　香港技術與創新中心同步營運　促進知識產權融資及創新發展,2025-12-22 17:00,2025-12-22 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200465.htm,"政府今日（十二月二十二日）宣布，知識產權融資沙盒正式推出，香港技術與創新支持中心亦同步營運，標誌着香港在推動知識產權融資、進一步發展知識產權交易生態圈和培育創新方面的重要里程碑。

行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》宣布推出知識產權融資沙盒，透過銀行、保險、估值、法律和其他專業，協助試點行業（特別是科技行業）利用知識產權進行融資。沙盒將提供一個協作和風險可控的環境，讓持份者測試整個融資安排和累積實務經驗。

融資沙盒由商務及經濟發展局（商經局）、知識產權署和香港金融管理局（金管局）共同籌劃，其運作建基於以下四項核心目標：

（一）確認知識產權價值：
參與銀行在信貸審批過程中，會考慮借款企業所擁有的知識產權資產價值，以及借款人的信貸需求、財務狀況及還款能力。

（二）獨立及標準化估值：
知識產權的估值會由獨立服務提供者按國際認可的方法進行，確保估值具公信力。在適用情況下，可索取專利質素分析報告，以支援相關估值程序。

（三）風險管理：
參與銀行須符合風險管理的監管要求；參與企業則須符合維護及發展相關知識產權資產的法例及法規要求。

（四）持份者協作：
計劃的成功有賴一個緊密協作的生態圈，沙盒匯聚擁有知識產權資產的企業、銀行、估值專家、法律執業者及其他相關專業人士，共同促成融資交易。

商經局局長丘應樺表示，知識產權融資沙盒連同其他《行政長官2025年施政報告》公布的相關措施，將有助發揮香港的獨特優勢，構建一個讓知識產權受嚴格保護、獲清晰估值及具融資信心的生態系統，從而鞏固香港作為區域知識產權貿易中心的地位。

透過讓企業運用其知識產權資產進行融資，沙盒可為企業打開新的融資渠道，支持科研及創意成果的商品化，並進一步推動創新科技成為經濟增長的重要動力。

三間主要銀行已承諾參與計劃，而來自法律及估值界別接近30間專業機構亦已表達濃厚參與意欲。商經局、知識產權署和金管局會密切監察試點項目的進展及收集意見，並按需要提供指導。沙盒計劃第一階段預計將有數宗試點個案。

此外，今日正式全面投入運作的香港技術與創新支持中心，是推動知識產權融資另一項重要配套措施。在知識產權署的協助下，中心將與創新科技界別的中小企業緊密合作，提供專利質素分析服務，按照國家標準，從法律、技術及經濟多個層面評估其專利的質素。政府亦會透過中心於二○二六年推出支援計劃，資助中小企業聘用專業服務提供者，為其整體知識產權組合進行金額估值。

上述綜合措施旨在就中小企業所持有專利的優勢，以及其整體知識產權組合的金額估值，提供客觀參考，從而促進更具效益的信貸評估及投資分析。
​
技術與創新支持中心是世界知識產權組織的專項計劃，旨在於創新周期不同階段支援科研人員及創新者，協助他們善用知識產權制度（特別是專利）保障發明，並引導其將技術商品化。隨着香港生產力促進局獲國家知識產權局和世界知識產權組織認可為技術與創新支持中心承辦機構，香港技術與創新支持中心正式成為國家200餘所技術與創新支持中心網絡的成員之一，推動香港更好地融入國家發展大局。"

黃金市場發展簡介會由財庫局舉辦，旨在向業界介紹政府建立國際黃金交易市場的長遠策略和整體方向，當中涵蓋拓展倉儲、提升黃金供給、建設基礎設施、豐富投資工具及發展本地黃金交易生態圈等多個範疇。交易所、銀行、資產管理、金礦勘探、貿易及精煉、倉儲和運輸界別均有派員出席。

許正宇說：「自行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》中前瞻性地提出要構建國際黃金交易中心，經過一年多的時間，結合政府、監管機構和業界的力量，我樂見香港黃金市場的全產業鏈已初步形成。過程中，業界反應正面，提供了許多寶貴意見。憑藉香港作為國際金融中心的地位，以及背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，我們會繼續與業界緊密合作，合力將香港打造為國際黃金交易、儲存、清算及風險管理的中心。」

他指出，政府至今推出的各項措施已取得實質進展。在倉儲設施方面，香港機場管理局已完成機場貴金屬儲存庫首階段擴建，容量達200公噸，並正積極落實進一步擴容至1 000公噸的計劃。同時，上海黃金交易所已在香港建立首個離岸倉庫。此外，財庫局已與深圳市地方金融管理局簽署合作備忘錄，共同構建深度融合的區域黃金生態圈，為港深兩地開展加工貿易合作奠定基礎。在黃金交易清算方面，由政府全資擁有的公司所管理的香港黃金中央清算系統計劃於二○二六年內開展試營運。

為支持業界成立黃金行業組織，政府將成立籌備小組，廣泛吸納本地及國際業界持份者參與，推動業界協作，促成一個由業界自主營運的行業組織。籌備小組將就行業組織的組成方式、成員資格及財務安排等細節深入討論。

許正宇補充說：「我們期望透過即將成立的籌備小組進一步加強與業界的合作。日後，行業組織將有助深化與政府及監管機構的溝通，並在業務發展、海內外推廣、國際合作及人才培育等方面發揮關鍵作用，助力香港黃金市場實現長遠發展。」"
SFST chairs briefing session on gold market development to outline future strategies and directions (with photos),2025-12-22 16:38,2025-12-22 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200457.htm,"The Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address that he has accepted the recommendations of the Working Group on Promoting Gold Market Development, and tasked the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) with taking forward the implementation work. At a briefing session on gold market development today (December 22), the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, told industry stakeholders that a complete industry chain has initially taken shape for Hong Kong's gold market, and the Government is actively working towards the goal of establishing Hong Kong as an international centre for gold trading, storage, clearing and risk management.

Organised by the FSTB, the briefing session aimed to introduce to the industry the Government's long-term strategy and overall direction for building an international gold trading market. This encompasses multiple areas, including expanding storage capacity, enhancing gold supply, establishing infrastructure, diversifying investment vehicles and developing a local gold trading ecosystem. Attendees included representatives from exchanges, banks, asset management companies, gold mining, trading firms and refineries, warehouse operators as well as logistics providers.

Mr Hui said, ""Stemming from the visionary idea of developing an international gold trading centre put forward by the Chief Executive in his 2024 Policy Address, I am pleased to see that Hong Kong's gold market has begun to take shape, with a complete industry chain preliminarily established over the past year or so under the concerted efforts of the Government, regulators and the industry. The industry's response has been positive, and many constructive suggestions have been received. Leveraging Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and its unique advantages of enjoying strong support from the motherland and being closely connected to the world, we will continue working closely with the industry, with a view to developing Hong Kong into an international hub for gold trading, storage, clearing and risk management.""

He highlighted the meaningful strides already realised through Government's initiatives. In terms of storage facilities, the Airport Authority Hong Kong has completed the first-phase expansion of the precious metals depository at the Hong Kong International Airport, increasing capacity to 200 tonnes, and is pressing ahead with plans to further expand it to 1 000 tonnes. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Gold Exchange has launched its first offshore vault in Hong Kong. In addition, the FSTB and the Shenzhen Municipal Financial Regulatory Bureau have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly build a deeply integrated regional gold ecosystem, laying a foundation for further co-operation in processing trade between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. On gold trading and clearing, the central clearing system for gold in Hong Kong, governed by a wholly government-owned company, is scheduled to commence trial operation in 2026.

To support the setting up of a trade organisation for the gold industry, the Government will set up a preparatory taskforce to engage a wide range of local and international stakeholders, with a view to promoting industry collaboration and facilitating the formation of a self-governing industry body. The preparatory taskforce will also hold in-depth discussions on details such as the structure, membership and financial arrangements of the future industry organisation.

Mr Hui added, ""Through the upcoming preparatory taskforce, we look forward to further strengthening our collaboration with the industry. The future industry organisation will help enhance communication with the Government and regulators, and play an instrumental role in business development, global promotion, international co-operation and talent nurturing, thereby contributing to the long-term development of Hong Kong's gold market."""
Consumer Price Indices for November 2025,2025-12-22 16:30,2025-12-22 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200435.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (December 22) the Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for November 2025. According to the Composite CPI, overall consumer prices rose by 1.2% in November 2025 over the same month a year earlier, the same as that in October 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rate of increase in the Composite CPI (i.e. the underlying inflation rate) in November 2025 was 1.0%, also the same as that in October 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, the average monthly rate of increase in the Composite CPI for the 3-month period ending November 2025 was 0.1%, the same as that for the 3-month period ending October 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the corresponding rates of increase were both 0.1%.

  Analysed by sub-index, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.5%, 1.1% and 1.1% respectively in November 2025, as compared to 1.4%, 1.1% and 1.0% respectively in October 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 0.9%, 1.0% and 1.1% respectively in November 2025, as compared to 0.9%, 1.0% and 1.0% respectively in October 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, for the 3-month period ending November 2025, the average monthly rates of change in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 0.0%, 0.1% and 0.1% respectively. The corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending October 2025 were 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the average monthly rates of change in the seasonally adjusted CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) for the 3-month period ending November 2025 were 0.0%, 0.1% and 0.1% respectively, and the corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending October 2025 were 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.2% respectively.

  Amongst the various components of the Composite CPI, year-on-year increases in prices were recorded in November 2025 for transport (3.5%), alcoholic drinks and tobacco (2.1%), miscellaneous services (1.9%), housing (1.6%), meals out and takeaway food (1.3%), miscellaneous goods (1.3%), and basic food (0.7%).

  On the other hand, year-on-year decreases in the components of the Composite CPI were recorded in November 2025 for clothing and footwear (-4.1%), durable goods (-3.3%), and electricity, gas and water (-0.5%).

  Taking the first 11 months of 2025 together, the Composite CPI rose by 1.4% over a year earlier. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.9%, 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.1%, 1.4%, 1.0% and 0.9% respectively.

  For the 3 months ending November 2025, the Composite CPI rose by 1.2% over a year earlier, while the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) rose by 1.4%, 1.0% and 1.0% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.0% and 1.0% respectively.

  For the 12 months ending November 2025, the Composite CPI was on average 1.4% higher than that in the preceding 12-month period. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.9%, 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.1%, 1.4%, 1.0% and 1.0% respectively.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that consumer price inflation stayed subdued in November, with the year-on-year increase in underlying Composite CPI unchanged at 1.0%. Price pressures on various major components were contained in general.

  Looking ahead, overall inflation should remain modest in the near term, as cost pressures on the domestic and external fronts are still broadly in check.

Further information

  The CPIs and year-on-year rates of change at section level for November 2025 are shown in Table 1. The time series on the year-on-year rates of change in the CPIs before and after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures are shown in Table 2. For discerning the latest trend in consumer prices, it is also useful to look at the changes in the seasonally adjusted CPIs. The time series on the average monthly rates of change during the latest 3 months for the seasonally adjusted CPIs are shown in Table 3. The rates of change in the original and the seasonally adjusted Composite CPI and the underlying inflation rate are presented graphically in Chart 1.

Hong Kong's Balance of Payments and International Investment Position statistics for third quarter of 2025,2025-12-22 16:30,2025-12-22 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200379.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (December 22) the preliminary Balance of Payments (BoP) and International Investment Position (IIP) statistics of Hong Kong for the third quarter of 2025. This release also included the preliminary External Debt (ED) statistics of Hong Kong for the same period.

I. Balance of Payments

  Hong Kong recorded a BoP deficit of $136.5 billion (16.0% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) in the third quarter of 2025. Reserve assets correspondingly decreased by the same amount. This was against a BoP surplus of $105.5 billion (13.4% of GDP) in the second quarter of 2025.

Current account

  The current account recorded a surplus of $98.2 billion (11.5% of GDP) in the third quarter of 2025. This reflects that Hong Kong's savings was greater than its investment, enabling Hong Kong to accumulate external financial assets (such as equity securities or debt securities) as a buffer against global financial volatilities. Compared with the current account surplus of $113.2 billion (13.9% of GDP) in the third quarter of 2024, the decrease in surplus was mainly due to the decrease in net inflow of primary income, partly offset by the increase in services surplus.

  The goods account recorded a surplus of $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2025, as against a deficit of $0.6 billion in the same quarter of 2024. Over the same period, the services surplus increased from $38.8 billion to $48.1 billion. The primary income inflow and outflow amounted to $576.1 billion and $521.5 billion respectively, thus yielding a net inflow of $54.5 billion in the third quarter of 2025, compared with a net inflow of $80.3 billion in the same quarter of 2024.

Financial account

  An overall increase in financial non-reserve assets amounting to $271.0 billion (31.7% of GDP) was recorded in the third quarter of 2025, compared with an overall increase of $21.1 billion (2.7% of GDP) in the second quarter of 2025. The overall increase recorded in the third quarter of 2025 was due to the net increases in other investment, portfolio investment and financial derivatives, partly offset by the net decrease in direct investment.

  In the third quarter of 2025, reserve assets decreased by $136.5 billion, as against an increase of $105.5 billion in the second quarter of 2025.

II. International Investment Position

  At the end of the third quarter of 2025, both Hong Kong's external financial assets and liabilities stood at a very high level, amounting to $59,586.8 billion (18.2 times of GDP) and $39,936.9 billion (12.2 times of GDP) respectively, a typical feature of a prominent international financial centre.

  Hong Kong's net external financial assets (i.e. assets minus liabilities) amounted to $19,649.9 billion (6.0 times of GDP) at the end of the third quarter of 2025, compared with $18,364.7 billion (5.7 times of GDP) at the end of the second quarter of 2025. Hong Kong's net external financial assets to GDP ratio is one of the largest in the world, which provides the economy with a strong cushion against sudden external shocks.

III. External Debt

  At the end of the third quarter of 2025, Hong Kong's gross ED amounted to $15,746.1 billion (4.8 times of GDP). Compared with $15,463.6 billion (also 4.8 times of GDP) at the end of the second quarter of 2025, gross ED increased by $282.5 billion. This was mainly attributable to the increase in ED of other sectors, while increases in ED of the banking sector, debt liabilities in direct investment (intercompany lending) and ED of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also contributed.

  As one of the world's major financial centres, Hong Kong has a significant amount of ED held against the local banking sector arising through normal banking businesses. At the end of the third quarter of 2025, 52.3% of Hong Kong's ED was attributable to the banking sector. Other ED mainly consisted of ED of other sectors (29.9%) and debt liabilities in direct investment (intercompany lending) (16.5%).

Further information

  BoP is a statistical statement that systematically summarises, for a specific time period (typically a year or a quarter), the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world (i.e. between residents and non-residents).

  IIP is a balance sheet showing the stock of external financial assets and liabilities of an economy at a particular time point.

  The difference between the total value of external financial assets and liabilities is the net IIP of the economy, which provides a measure of net financial claims on non residents plus gold bullion held as monetary gold.

  Gross ED, at a particular time point, is the outstanding amount of those actual current, and not contingent, liabilities that are owed to non-residents by residents of an economy and that require payment of principals and / or interests by the debtors at some time points in the future.

  Table 1 presents Hong Kong's BoP. Table 2 presents the detailed current account and capital account, while Table 3 presents the detailed financial account. Table 4 shows Hong Kong's IIP, and Table 5 shows Hong Kong's ED.

  Statistics on BoP, IIP and ED for the third quarter of 2025 are preliminary figures, which are subject to revision upon the availability of more data. With the incorporation of the latest data from surveys and other sources, the statistics on BoP, IIP and ED for 2024 have been revised.

  The latest statistical tables of BoP (including seasonally adjusted current account), IIP and ED can be downloaded at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/scode260.html). Analysis of the statistics, together with the conceptual and methodological details, are presented in the publication Balance of Payments, International Investment Position and External Debt Statistics of Hong Kong, Third Quarter 2025 published by the C&SD. Users can download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1040001&scode=260).

二零二五年第三季香港國際收支平衡及國際投資頭寸統計,2025-12-22 16:30,2025-12-22 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200430.htm,"政府統計處今日（十二月二十二日）發布二零二五年第三季香港國際收支平衡及國際投資頭寸的初步統計數字，並一併發布同期的香港對外債務的初步統計數字。

I.國際收支平衡

香港於二零二五年第三季錄得1,365億元的國際收支赤字（相當於本地生產總值的16.0%），而儲備資產相應地減少同等數額。二零二五年第二季則錄得1,055億元的盈餘（相當於本地生產總值的13.4%）。

經常賬戶

二零二五年第三季的經常賬戶錄得982億元盈餘（相當於本地生產總值的11.5%），這反映香港儲蓄多於投資，令其累積對外金融資產（例如股本證券或債務證券），在環球金融波動時提供緩衝。與二零二四年第三季的1,132億元經常賬戶盈餘（相當於本地生產總值的13.9%）比較，盈餘減少主要是由於初次收入淨流入減少，而服務貿易盈餘增加則抵銷了部分經常賬戶盈餘的跌幅。

二零二五年第三季的貨物貿易錄得15億元盈餘，而二零二四年同季則錄得6億元赤字。同期，服務貿易盈餘由388億元增加至481億元。二零二五年第三季的初次收入流入和流出分別為5,761億元和5,215億元，從而產生545億元淨流入，而二零二四年同季則錄得803億元淨流入。

金融賬戶

二零二五年第三季非儲備金融資產錄得2,710億元的整體增幅（相當於本地生產總值的31.7%），而二零二五年第二季則錄得211億元的整體增幅（相當於本地生產總值的2.7%）。二零二五年第三季的整體增幅源自其他投資、證券投資和金融衍生工具淨增加，而直接投資淨減少則抵銷了部分的整體增幅。

二零二五年第三季儲備資產減少1,365億元，而二零二五年第二季則增加1,055億元。

II. 國際投資頭寸

在二零二五年第三季季末，香港的對外金融資產和負債總值均處於很高的水平，分別為595,868億元（相當於本地生產總值的18.2倍）和399,369億元（相當於本地生產總值的12.2倍），這是一個重要國際金融中心常見的特點。

在二零二五年第三季季末，香港的對外金融資產淨值（即資產扣除負債）達196,499億元（相當於本地生產總值的6.0倍），而二零二五年第二季季末則為183,647億元（相當於本地生產總值的5.7倍）。香港的對外金融資產淨值與本地生產總值的比率是世界最大之一，為香港經濟面對突如其來的外來衝擊發揮強大的緩衝作用。

III. 對外債務

在二零二五年第三季季末，香港的對外債務總額為157,461億元（相當於本地生產總值的4.8倍）。與二零二五年第二季季末的154,636億元（亦是相當於本地生產總值的4.8倍）比較，對外債務總額增加2,825億元，這主要歸因於其他界別對外債務的增加，而銀行界別對外債務的增加、直接投資債務負債（公司間借貸）以及香港金融管理局對外債務的增加也起到了推動作用。

作為世界其中一個主要金融中心，香港有大量源於本地銀行界別、透過日常的銀行業務而產生的對外債務。在二零二五年第三季季末，銀行界別的對外債務佔整體的52.3%。其他的對外債務主要包括其他界別的對外債務（29.9%）和直接投資的債務負債（公司間借貸）（16.5%）。

其他資料

國際收支平衡是一項統計報表，有系統地撮錄在一個指定期間內（一般是一年或一季）某經濟體與世界各地之間（即居民與非居民之間）進行的經濟交易。

國際投資頭寸是顯示一個經濟體在某特定時點的對外金融資產及負債存量的資產負債表。對外金融資產及負債總值的差額為該經濟體的國際投資頭寸淨值，等於對非居民的淨金融債權加上作為貨幣黃金持有的金塊。

對外債務總額指一個經濟體的居民在某特定時點欠非居民的實際現有（而並非或有）未償還負債款額。負債人並須於將來某些時點償還本金及／或利息。

表1展示香港國際收支平衡。表2展示詳細的經常賬戶及資本賬戶，而表3則展示詳細的金融賬戶。表4展示香港的國際投資頭寸，而表5則展示香港的對外債務。

二零二五年第三季的國際收支平衡、國際投資頭寸及對外債務統計數字均屬初步數字，日後將根據更新資料修訂。納入統計調查及其他來源的最新資料後，二零二四年的國際收支平衡、國際投資頭寸及對外債務統計數字現已修訂。

最新的國際收支平衡（包括經季節性調整的經常賬戶）、國際投資頭寸及對外債務的統計表可於政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/scode260.html）下載。相關統計數字的分析和概念及方法，載列於政府統計處出版的《香港國際收支平衡、國際投資頭寸及對外債務統計（2025年第3季）》內。用戶可以在政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1040001&scode=260）下載該刊物。

尊敬的徐啟方副主任（國務院港澳事務辦公室分管日常工作的副主任）、尊敬的周霽主任（中央政府駐港聯絡辦公室主任）、尊敬的羅晃浩副市長（深圳市副市長）、各位嘉賓、各位市民：

歡迎各位今日齊聚在河套，共同見證香港創科發展的一個里程碑時刻——河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區，今日正式開園！

由香港園區連同深圳園區所組成的河套合作區，是國家「十四五」規劃下粵港澳大灣區的一個重要合作平台。河套的發展目標是要成為世界級創新平台，是國家實現地理上橫跨兩種社會制度、經濟和司法體制優勢，以科技創新為主題的重大合作區。

我衷心感謝中央政府一直以來的大力支持，亦感謝廣東省政府和深圳市政府，多年與特區政府和港深創新及科技園公司緊密合作，共同推動園區構建，實踐「一國兩制」下「一河兩岸」、「一區兩園」的創新理念。

去年，香港特區政府發布了《河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區發展綱要》，闡明香港園區的重點發展方向和策略，全力打造園區成為聯通內地與國際的世界級科技創新樞紐、國家培育發展新質生產力的重要策源地。

今年三月底，我在此出席了園區首三座大樓的平頂儀式，當時與各位提出了我們在此開啓創科新局面的四個理念，包括要以建設為基、以改革為綱、以融合為義、以合作為要，展示香港在創科領域不斷實現突破的決心。今日，港深創新及科技園已進入正式開園時刻，我想與大家介紹園區發展體現的三個關鍵進展。

第一，生動體現創科動力，積極構建高端人才集聚高地。自從園區三座大樓在三月平頂到今日這九個月以來，兩座濕實驗室大樓已有超過60間來自海外、內地及香港的企業和機構簽署租約，已租出約八成的樓面面積。園區設有生物樣本庫、數據中心等讓租戶使用的共用設施，同時，園區的人才公寓亦已迎來首批住客。

世界各地的創科企業和科研人員踴躍進駐園區，以行動投下對香港園區發展的信心一票。我們會積極向全球推廣大灣區建設和河套發展的龐大機遇，繼續吸引各地更多企業和人才一同在這片創科沃土大展鴻圖。

第二，全力實踐科研擴容，加快發展國際創新科技樞紐。香港園區第一批其餘的五座大樓，將會在二○二七年開始陸續完工。同時，香港園區的第二期規劃已經完成，會以凝聚高效市場和有為政府的公私營合作模式，加快建設發展。香港園區兩期發展提供的總樓面面積將達200萬平方米，規模比原本的規劃大增七成，為園區企業提供更多發展空間。

園區在未來將按功能劃分科技區塊，涵蓋生命健康科技、人工智能與數據科學、新科技與先進製造等支柱產業，推動產業有序發展，促進上、中、下游不同階段協同發展，打造完整創科產業鏈，服務大灣區構建國際科技創新中心的宏大目標。

第三，創新實現合作維度，高效促進跨境創科要素流動。隨着香港園區建設陸續落成，未來將有越來越多企業進駐園區這片創科沃土，園區將提供政策和基礎配套，便利科研人員往返兩地。

我在此向大家宣布，今日除了是香港園區正式開園，亦是連接港深兩個園區的西面跨河連接橋項目正式啓動的重要日子。

這項工程將打通河套合作區的交通網絡，有效促進跨境人員流動，發揮深港口岸設施和管理創新政策的優勢。深港雙方構建跨河連接橋，會突出科技低碳、安全便捷、宜人宜景的方向，實現連接橋與周邊生態環境融為一體的設計理念，並採用「一跨過河」的方案建造，體現連繫兩地園區「一區兩園」的新標誌，聯通大灣區的創新脈絡。

展望未來，我們將繼續推進河套香港園區的建設和發展，包括優化制度銜接、深化政策支援、積極引入優質企業與世界級科研團隊等。我有信心，河套合作區將成為香港創科發展的橋頭堡和試驗田，更將成為粵港澳大灣區，以至全球創新版圖上的創新政策示範地，是富有強大推動力的發展香港引擎。

就讓我們攜手並肩，堅持創新精神，共同開拓未來，一起服務國家高質量發展，共同譜寫創科新篇章。我祝願河套香港園區發展蒸蒸日上，在座各位鵬程萬里，一切順利。多謝大家！"

日本進口水產的檢測情況,2025-12-22 16:15,2025-12-22 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200510.htm,"因應日本政府單方面決定把福島核電站核污水排放大海，食物環境衞生署署長已發出《食物安全命令》，禁止源自日本10（都）縣的水產、海鹽和海藻食品進口本港，受禁（都）縣包括東京、福島、茨城、宮城、千葉、群馬、栃木、新潟、長野和埼玉。

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由十二月十九日中午截至今日（十二月二十二日）中午，食安中心已在過去三日（包括過去的星期六及星期日）對364個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

同期，漁農自然護理署（漁護署）已對152個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。詳情可參閱漁護署網頁（www.afcd.gov.hk/tc_chi/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html）。

香港天文台亦已加強監測本港水域的環境輻射水平。至目前為止，並沒有發現異常情況。詳情可參閱香港天文台的網頁（www.hko.gov.hk/tc/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html）。

Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-12-22 16:15,2025-12-22 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200511.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on December 19 to noon today (December 22), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 364 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday).

行政長官出席港深創新及科技園開園典禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-12-22 16:15,2025-12-22 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200533.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十二月二十二日）出席港深創新及科技園開園典禮的致辭：

尊敬的徐啟方副主任（國務院港澳事務辦公室分管日常工作的副主任）、尊敬的周霽主任（中央政府駐港聯絡辦公室主任）、尊敬的羅晃浩副市長（深圳市副市長）、各位嘉賓、各位市民：

歡迎各位今日齊聚在河套，共同見證香港創科發展的一個里程碑時刻——河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區，今日正式開園！

由香港園區連同深圳園區所組成的河套合作區，是國家「十四五」規劃下粵港澳大灣區的一個重要合作平台。河套的發展目標是要成為世界級創新平台，是國家實現地理上橫跨兩種社會制度、經濟和司法體制優勢，以科技創新為主題的重大合作區。

我衷心感謝中央政府一直以來的大力支持，亦感謝廣東省政府和深圳市政府，多年與特區政府和港深創新及科技園公司緊密合作，共同推動園區構建，實踐「一國兩制」下「一河兩岸」、「一區兩園」的創新理念。

去年，香港特區政府發布了《河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區發展綱要》，闡明香港園區的重點發展方向和策略，全力打造園區成為聯通內地與國際的世界級科技創新樞紐、國家培育發展新質生產力的重要策源地。

今年三月底，我在此出席了園區首三座大樓的平頂儀式，當時與各位提出了我們在此開啓創科新局面的四個理念，包括要以建設為基、以改革為綱、以融合為義、以合作為要，展示香港在創科領域不斷實現突破的決心。今日，港深創新及科技園已進入正式開園時刻，我想與大家介紹園區發展體現的三個關鍵進展。

第一，生動體現創科動力，積極構建高端人才集聚高地。自從園區三座大樓在三月平頂到今日這九個月以來，兩座濕實驗室大樓已有超過60間來自海外、內地及香港的企業和機構簽署租約，已租出約八成的樓面面積。園區設有生物樣本庫、數據中心等讓租戶使用的共用設施，同時，園區的人才公寓亦已迎來首批住客。

世界各地的創科企業和科研人員踴躍進駐園區，以行動投下對香港園區發展的信心一票。我們會積極向全球推廣大灣區建設和河套發展的龐大機遇，繼續吸引各地更多企業和人才一同在這片創科沃土大展鴻圖。

第二，全力實踐科研擴容，加快發展國際創新科技樞紐。香港園區第一批其餘的五座大樓，將會在二○二七年開始陸續完工。同時，香港園區的第二期規劃已經完成，會以凝聚高效市場和有為政府的公私營合作模式，加快建設發展。香港園區兩期發展提供的總樓面面積將達200萬平方米，規模比原本的規劃大增七成，為園區企業提供更多發展空間。

園區在未來將按功能劃分科技區塊，涵蓋生命健康科技、人工智能與數據科學、新科技與先進製造等支柱產業，推動產業有序發展，促進上、中、下游不同階段協同發展，打造完整創科產業鏈，服務大灣區構建國際科技創新中心的宏大目標。

第三，創新實現合作維度，高效促進跨境創科要素流動。隨着香港園區建設陸續落成，未來將有越來越多企業進駐園區這片創科沃土，園區將提供政策和基礎配套，便利科研人員往返兩地。

我在此向大家宣布，今日除了是香港園區正式開園，亦是連接港深兩個園區的西面跨河連接橋項目正式啓動的重要日子。

這項工程將打通河套合作區的交通網絡，有效促進跨境人員流動，發揮深港口岸設施和管理創新政策的優勢。深港雙方構建跨河連接橋，會突出科技低碳、安全便捷、宜人宜景的方向，實現連接橋與周邊生態環境融為一體的設計理念，並採用「一跨過河」的方案建造，體現連繫兩地園區「一區兩園」的新標誌，聯通大灣區的創新脈絡。

展望未來，我們將繼續推進河套香港園區的建設和發展，包括優化制度銜接、深化政策支援、積極引入優質企業與世界級科研團隊等。我有信心，河套合作區將成為香港創科發展的橋頭堡和試驗田，更將成為粵港澳大灣區，以至全球創新版圖上的創新政策示範地，是富有強大推動力的發展香港引擎。

就讓我們攜手並肩，堅持創新精神，共同開拓未來，一起服務國家高質量發展，共同譜寫創科新篇章。我祝願河套香港園區發展蒸蒸日上，在座各位鵬程萬里，一切順利。多謝大家！"

香港文化博物館展覽展示香港藝術家非遺新演繹（附圖）,2025-12-22 15:38,2025-12-22 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200321.htm,"香港文化博物館現正舉行「香港快拍．城市漫步—香港視覺藝術與非遺創新」展覽，四組香港年輕藝術家，包括嶺南畫派第四代藝術家羅令潔、香港長衫協會、ditto ditto版畫工作室及啟蜂製作，透過瓷畫、服裝設計、版畫及展覽裝置設計，展示香港獨特的城市景觀及文化面貌。展期至明年三月二日，免費入場。

展覽自二○二四年十月起，在第九屆「港澳視覺藝術雙年展」香港單元中展出，先後在杭州、南京、北京、廣州、深圳五個城市巡迴展覽，向內地觀眾展示香港獨特的城市文化景觀，反應熱烈。展覽現回到香港展出，更加入了香港非物資文化遺產（非遺）的解說，深入發掘藝術家對香港非遺及傳統工藝的守護、傳承與創新詮釋。

藝術家羅令潔傳承嶺南派畫風，結合西方繪畫技法繪製五組彩繪瓷碟。她以香港特色花鳥、自然景觀及歷史建築為題，於景德鎮白瓷碟上作畫。經過反覆的色彩及技法實驗，開闢了新穎的表現方法，更細緻地呈現瓷畫的彩色與光線變化。

香港長衫協會是國家級非物質文化遺產代表性項目的保護單位。其年輕設計團隊，以香港特色建築和城市記憶為題，將傳統非遺長衫工藝及經典剪裁，結合嶄新的提花與立體打印等先進技術，創作出四組兼具時代感的男女裝長衫，讓非遺工藝推廣至年輕一代。

ditto ditto版畫工作室一直致力將活版印刷技術的手工質感融入紙品設計，以香港的旅遊景點、風景名勝和美食為題，製作四套版畫及明信片。

啟蜂製作設計團隊則以靈活多變的香港街頭盒仔檔作概念，設計出四組融入舊香港視覺元素的摺疊組合式展覽裝置，並用作陳列上述三組藝術作品。

Heritage Museum exhibition showcases new creation by Hong Kong artists inspired by ICH (with photos),2025-12-22 15:38,2025-12-22 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200322.htm,"  The Hong Kong Heritage Museum is staging the ""HK Snapshotsâ§City Walks: Fresh Takes on Hong Kong's Art and Cultural Heritage"" exhibition, featuring four groups of young local artists, namely the fourth-generation Lingnan School artist Rebecca Lo, the Hong Kong Cheongsam Association, printing studio ditto ditto, and Key-Point Productions. Through porcelain painting, fashion design, letterpress printing and exhibition installation design, the exhibition presents unique facets of Hong Kong's cityscape and cultural personality. The exhibition will run until March 2 next year, with free admission.

  The exhibition has been on display at the Hong Kong section of the ninth edition of the Hong Kong-Macao Visual Art Biennale since October 2024. It has since travelled to five cities - Hangzhou, Nanjing, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen - and has received an overwhelming response. The exhibition introduced Hong Kong's unique cultural landscape to Mainland audiences. Now, it has returned to Hong Kong with supplementary information about the city's intangible cultural heritage (ICH), delving into the commitment of the artists to preserving, transmitting and innovatively interpreting Hong Kong's ICH and traditional craft skills.

  Lo inherits the painting style of the Lingnan School and incorporates the techniques of Western painting to create five porcelain plate sets. She painted local flowers and birds, natural landscapes, and historic buildings on Jingdezhen's white porcelain. With tireless experimentation with paints and techniques, she crafts new expressive forms, revealing colours and intricate variations on the porcelain with vivid detail.

  The Hong Kong Cheongsam Association, the protection organisation of the national ICH item, has formed a young designer team to create four innovative sets of men's and women's cheongsams. Featuring the city's unique architecture and memories, the team combines traditional ICH craftsmanship and classic tailoring with advanced technologies such as innovative jacquard weaving and 3D printing, promoting this ICH craftsmanship to younger generations.

  Adding personal touches to paper product design with the letterpress printing technique, the printing studio ditto ditto created four sets of printed works, postcards and calendars depicting Hong Kong attractions, scenic spots and cuisine.

  Designers from Key-Point Productions have drawn inspiration from flexible street stalls and have incorporated numerous visual elements from old Hong Kong into four foldable exhibition installations for displaying the three groups of artworks mentioned above.

Waste-to-energy facility IÂ·PARK1 trial operation proceeds smoothly (with photos/video),2025-12-22 15:28,2025-12-22 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200384.htm,"âThe Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (December 22) announced that the Integrated Waste Management Facilities Phase I (I·PARK1) has commenced the first phase of trial operation.

The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan; the Permanent Secretary for Environment and Ecology (Environment), Mr Eddie Cheung; the Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong; and the Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui, recently visited I·PARK1 to inspect its operations, observing various facility sections, including the unloading and tipping of waste compactor containers, waste treatment processes, waste-to-energy equipment, and flue gas treatment and emission control. They were also briefed by the project team on the progress of the trial operation.

Located on an artificial island off Shek Kwu Chau, I·PARK1 adopts advanced waste incineration technology capable of effectively decomposing organic compounds, including dioxins. I·PARK1 consists of three incineration modules, with a designed municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment capacity of 3 000 tonnes per day. At present, the first module, capable of processing 1 000 tonnes of MSW daily, has already commenced trial operation. The remaining two modules will begin phased trial operations at a later stage. The heat recovered from the incineration process is used to generate electricity, not only powering the facility's daily operation but also exporting 480 million kilowatt-hours of electricity to the public power grid, which is enough to power 100 000 households each year.

Following the inspection, Mr Tse said, ""The completion and phased commissioning of I·PARK1 marks the launch of a new approach for managing MSW in Hong Kong beyond reliance on landfills. It signifies a crucial step of Hong Kong toward achieving our target of 'zero waste landfilling' by 2035. In the meantime, we are advancing at full steam the construction of the Integrated Waste Management Facility Phase 2 (I·PARK2) in Tsang Tsui, Tuen Mun, while we remain committed to driving forward various initiatives on waste reduction, recycling, and resource circulation, continuing our progress toward the goal of 'zero waste landfilling' and carbon neutrality.""

Dr Chui said that the EPD has been closely monitoring the trial operation of I·PARK1 to ensure its operation and emissions comply with the stringent safety and environmental standards. Following I·PARK1's progressive commencement of operation, the total amount of MSW transported to West New Territories Landfill and North East New Territories Landfill will be reduced accordingly, alleviating the pressure on the two landfills.

In 2024, a total of 10 510 tonnes of MSW daily was disposed of in Hong Kong. I.PARK1 and the proposed I.PARK2 can treat 9 000 tonnes of MSW in total per day. If Hong Kong society can keep the momentum of waste reduction and increase the recycling rate, there may not be a need to construct I·PARK3 to achieve ""zero waste landfilling""."
轉廢為能設施I·PARK1試行運作順利（附圖／短片）,2025-12-22 15:27,2025-12-22 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200378.htm,"環境保護署（環保署）今日（十二月二十二日）表示，香港首座現代都市固體廢物轉廢為能設施──綜合廢物管理設施第一期（I·PARK1）已進入首階段試行運作。

環境及生態局局長謝展寰、環境及生態局常任秘書長（環境）張國財、環境及生態局副局長黃淑嫻及環保署署長徐浩光博士日前到訪I·PARK1視察其運作情況，實地了解設施的運作，包括壓縮貨櫃上岸及傾卸、廢物處理程序、轉廢為能設備和煙氣及排放處理等，並聽取了工程團隊匯報試運情況。

I·PARK1位於石鼓洲旁人工島上，採用先進的焚化技術，能有效分解包括二噁英在內的有機化合物。該設施共設有三個焚化模組，處理量為每日3 000公噸都市固體廢物。目前，第一個焚化模組已進入試行運作階段，每日可處理1 000公噸都市固體廢物，其餘兩個模組亦將於稍後分階段開始試行運作。焚燒處理過程中產生的熱能將用作發電，除供設施日常運作外，每年可輸出約4億8 000萬度電力至公眾電網，足夠供10萬戶家庭使用一年。

謝展寰在視察後表示：「I·PARK1的落成及陸續投入服務，為香港廢物管理開啓新篇章，把都市固體廢物轉化成能源，減少對堆填區的依賴，標誌着香港踏出了達致在二○三五年都市固體廢物『零廢堆填』的重要一步。我們現正全力推進於屯門曾咀興建第二座轉廢為能設施I·PARK2，配合持續推行的減廢回收和資源循環的工作，香港正穩步邁向『零廢堆填』及碳中和的目標，創建綠色未來。」

徐浩光博士表示，環保署會密切監察I·PARK1的試行運作，確保其運作和排放符合嚴格的安全和環保標準。隨着I·PARK1陸續投入服務，現時運往新界西及新界東北堆填區的都市固體廢物總量將會相應降低，舒緩兩個堆填區處理廢物的壓力。

二○二四年，香港都市固體廢物總棄置量為每日10 510公噸，I·PARK1及擬建的I·PARK2每日合共可處理9 000公噸固體廢物，若香港社會可以繼續減廢和增加回收量，可望無須興建第三個焚化爐而達到「零廢堆填」的目標。"
食環署持續落實規管私人泳池救生員措施,2025-12-22 15:00,2025-12-22 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200227.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）發言人今日（十二月二十二日）表示，為保障泳池使用者的安全，食環署自今年五月起實施一系列加強規管私人泳池救生員的措施，至今運作暢順並達致預期效果。食環署將持續推行該等措施。

截至十一月三十日，食環署今年於不同時段對全港逾1 400個持牌私人泳池進行約11 000次巡查，並透過中國香港拯溺總會核實超過5 000個救生員資格，當中發現一宗懷疑有救生員使用虛假救生員證件的個案。食環署已就事件報警，並就泳池開放期間未有提供足夠合資格救生員向有關泳池持牌人提出檢控。其後，該泳池持牌人因違反《泳池規例》（第132CA章第12條）在裁判法院被判罪名成立，罰款8,000元；而不合資格的救生員亦因欺詐罪及以欺騙手段取得金錢利益罪被警方起訴，在裁判法院被判罪名成立，判處監禁兩個月。此外，食環署亦發現兩宗懷疑未有提供足夠合資格救生員的個案，並已展開調查，如有足夠證據會提出檢控。同期，食環署人員在巡查期間就泳池持牌人違反與救生員有關的牌照條件共發出13個口頭警告，涉及未有在泳池入口展示在場當值的救生員數目及未有妥善填寫或保存救生員每日當值紀錄等。

發言人說：「整體而言，絕大部分泳池均遵守與救生員有關的規定，而食環署的巡查亦能有效找出違規個案。食環署會持續執行各項措施，保障泳池使用者的安全。」

發言人強調，泳池持牌人必須嚴格履行核實救生員資格的責任，確保泳池開放期間有足夠的合資格救生員當值。食環署提醒所有泳池持牌人，切勿聘用不合資格的救生員或容許使用虛假資格的救生員當值，並須嚴格遵守《泳池規例》（第132CA章）及其他牌照條件。如發現違規情況，署方會嚴肅跟進。

食環署自今年五月十九日起實施一系列加強規管私人泳池救生員的措施，包括在不同時段增加巡查頻次、規定持牌人在聘用救生員前須核對其身分證明文件並將其救生章和救生手冊的副本存檔、引入新懲處機制、加強與中國香港拯溺總會及物業管理業監管局合作等。"

FEHD continues to implement regulatory measures for life-saving attendants at private swimming pools,2025-12-22 15:00,2025-12-22 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200229.htm,"A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (December 22) that, to safeguard swimming pool users, the FEHD has implemented a series of enhancement measures regulating life-saving attendants at private swimming pools from May this year. The FEHD will continue to implement these measures, which have been operating smoothly to date and have achieved the intended results.

As at November 30, the FEHD had conducted approximately 11 000 inspections at various times of the day across over 1 400 licensed private swimming pools in Hong Kong, and had verified over 5 000 lifeguard qualifications through the Hong Kong China Life Saving Society (HKLSS) this year. One case involving suspected use of a fraudulent life-saving attendant certificate was identified. The FEHD reported it to the Police and prosecuted the swimming pool licensee for failing to provide a sufficient number of qualified life-saving attendants during pool opening hours. The licensee concerned was subsequently convicted by the magistrates' court for contravening the Swimming Pools Regulation (Section 12 of Cap. 132CA) and fined $8,000. The unqualified life-saving attendant who used the fraudulent qualification was also prosecuted by the Police and sentenced to two months' imprisonment for the offences of ""fraud"" and ""obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception"". In addition, two other suspected cases of insufficient provision of qualified life-saving attendants were found and the FEHD has initiated investigations. Prosecutions will be instituted should there be sufficient evidence. During the inspections over the same period, FEHD officers issued a total of 13 verbal warnings against licensees for violating the licensing conditions relating to life-saving attendants. These warnings involved failures to display at the pool entrances the number of life-saving attendants on duty and to properly complete or maintain life-saving attendants' daily duty records.

The spokesman said, ""Overall, most of the swimming pools were in compliance with the regulations relating to life-saving attendants, and the FEHD's inspections were effective in identifying suspected violations. The FEHD will continue to execute the measures to ensure the safety of swimming pool users.""

The spokesman stressed that swimming pool licensees are required to strictly fulfill their responsibility of verifying the qualifications of life-saving attendants and ensuring sufficient qualified life-saving attendants are on duty while the pool is open. The FEHD reminded all swimming pool licensees not to employ unqualified life-saving attendants or permit those with fraudulent qualifications to be on duty, and to strictly observe the Swimming Pools Regulation (Cap. 132CA) and other licensing conditions. The FEHD will take stringent follow-up actions against any violation identified.

陳茂波說：「在地緣政治、科技變革、綠色轉型等多個大趨勢的多重驅動下，全球就貴金屬、有色金屬、傳統能源、新能源相關材料等大宗商品的供需形勢正經歷深刻變化。我國是大宗商品的主要消費國和進出口市場之一，並正全速推動高質量發展、堅定邁向雙碳目標，加大對綠色產業的投入；這些發展都突顯國家在建設大宗商品資源配置樞紐上的優勢。香港作為國際金融、貿易和航運中心，『一國兩制』下有『內聯外通』的獨特優勢，其中資金、貨物、資訊自由流動，加上高效的金融、物流和專業服務，以及便捷通達的交通運輸網絡，在發展大宗商品市場方面具有龐大的潛力，能服務和貢獻國家以至全球在這個領域的發展，同時為自身開創更多元的發展機遇。」

「過去一兩年間，香港正積極建構更蓬勃的大宗商品生態，從加入倫敦金屬交易所的全球倉庫網絡，以促進實體金屬的交割活動；到加速建立國際黃金交易市場等，我們在這方面已經邁出了堅實的步伐。接下來，政府會通過高層統籌規劃，制訂和踐行全面的大宗商品發展策略，抓緊未來的發展機遇。」

他續說：「委員會匯聚大宗商品交易生態圈，包括金融、商貿、航運、物流、專業服務等行業相關的業界領袖，全方位深入研究全球大宗商品市場趨勢，全面檢視實物貿易、金融及衍生工具交易及航運物流等環節的現狀和趨勢，並深入調研各類主要和新興類別的大宗商品業務在港發展的機遇，優化市場機制與規管架構，構建行業生態圈，以及探索與內地市場的互聯互通。委員會亦會就香港大宗商品市場的定位、規劃發展和推廣策略等提供具體建議。」

委員會於今日的會議上聽取了有關全球大宗商品市場趨勢和香港發展潛力的匯報，並就委員會優先聚焦調研探討的商品範疇和重點進行討論。
