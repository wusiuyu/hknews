37名分間單位規管租賃業主因違反相關法例規定而被定罪,2025-12-19 17:16,2025-12-19 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900649.htm,"37名分間單位業主因違反《業主與租客（綜合）條例》（第7章）第IVA部（《條例》）的相關規定，於十二月五日、十二月十二日及今日（十二月十九日）在東區裁判法院承認有關控罪，並被判處罰款介乎800元至19,200元，合計罰款共121,350元。自《條例》生效以來，差餉物業估價署（估價署）持續加強採取執法行動，至今已合共檢控1 397宗個案，而就法庭已處理的1 024宗個案，均全數成功定罪，共涉及897名分間單位業主，合計總罰款共2,742,560元，另有373宗個案則正等待進行聆訊。

該37名業主的罪行包括（一）沒有在規管租賃的租期開始後的60日內，向估價署署長提交租賃通知書（表格AR2）；及（二）要求租客支付不屬《條例》所准許的種類的款項（包括要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額）。

估價署於早前發現這些業主涉嫌違反《條例》的相關規定。經深入調查及搜集證據後，估價署向這些業主提出檢控。

估價署發言人重申，分間單位業主必須嚴格遵守《條例》下的相關規定，包括禁止業主刻意打擾租戶成員的安寧或舒適生活等，意圖使租客放棄佔用其分間單位；要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額；同時提醒租客在《條例》下所享有的權益，包括四年（即兩年加兩年）的租住權保障。他亦強調估價署會繼續堅決執法，打擊任何違例個案。估價署除了跟進舉報個案，亦一直以多管齊下的方式主動識別、調查及跟進有關業主涉嫌違反《條例》規定的個案。就此，估價署要求規管租賃的業主提供與租賃有關的資料及參考文件，以核實他們是否已遵從《條例》的規定。如業主無合理辯解而拒絕提供相關資料或忽略署方要求，即屬違法，最高可處第三級罰款（10,000元）及監禁三個月。因應實際情況和所蒐集的資料及證據，估價署會對個別個案採取適當行動，包括就涉嫌觸犯《條例》下罪行的個案提出檢控。此外，估價署已展開新一輪宣傳教育工作，加強宣傳《條例》下主要罪行及刑罰，並強調會主動審查業主有否觸犯《條例》下罪行。

為幫助盡早遏止違法行為，市民應盡快向估價署舉報涉嫌違規個案。舉報渠道包括電話熱線（2150 8303）、電郵（enquiries@rvd.gov.hk）、傳真（2116 4920）、郵寄（九龍長沙灣道303號長沙灣政府合署15樓）或親身到訪（香港灣仔告士打道7號入境事務大樓38樓3816-22室，估價署租務科辦公室，到訪前請先致電2150 8303預約）。此外，估價署亦已於其網頁提供一份表格（表格AR4）（www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/tc/forms/ar4.pdf），便利分間單位租客向估價署作出舉報。

估價署提醒，根據《條例》，規管租賃的規管周期，須由該分間單位的連續兩項規管租賃（即首期租賃及次期租賃）所組成，而每項規管租賃的租期為兩年。分間單位首期租賃的租客有權獲授予有關規管周期中的次期租賃，從而享有總共四年的租住權保障。估價署陸續按照首期租賃屆滿的時間，分批發信給相關規管租賃的業主和租客並夾附有關資訊，旨在協助他們了解次期租賃的重要事項，並提醒應在擬達成的次期租賃開始前約兩個月須遵從的程序，以及在《條例》下的相關義務和權益。有關業主及租客亦可瀏覽估價署網站內的次期租賃專頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html）的相關資料，包括「一圖看清」、小冊子、教學短片及常見問題。有關業主及租客亦應熟悉相關的法定要求，以及就次期租賃保持密切溝通，並按《條例》適切處理有關事宜。

如就規管租賃事宜有疑問，可致電電話熱線（2150 8303）或瀏覽估價署網頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/our_services/part_iva.html）內的相關資訊。"
37 landlords of subdivided units under regulated tenancies convicted of contravening relevant statutory requirements,2025-12-19 17:16,2025-12-19 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900653.htm,"  Thirty-seven landlords of subdivided units (SDUs), who contravened Part IVA of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7) (the Ordinance), pleaded guilty and were fined between $800 and $19,200, amounting to a total of $121,350, on December 5, December 12 and today (December 19) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. Since the Ordinance came into force, the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) has continuously strengthened enforcement actions and has prosecuted a total of 1 397 cases to date. Among the 1 024 cases dealt with by the court, all were successfully convicted, which involved a total of 897 SDU landlords, amounting to a total of $2,742,560 in fines. In addition, 373 cases are pending a hearing.

  The offences of these 37 landlords include (1) failing to submit a Notice of Tenancy (Form AR2) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation within 60 days after the term of the regulated tenancy commenced; and (2) requesting the tenant to pay money other than the types permitted under the Ordinance (including requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance).

  The RVD earlier discovered that the landlords failed to comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance. Upon a comprehensive investigation and evidence collection, the RVD prosecuted the landlords.

  A spokesman for the RVD reiterated that SDU landlords must comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance, including prohibiting landlords from doing any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of members of the tenant's household, with the intention of causing the tenant to give up occupation of the SDU; or requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance, and also reminded tenants of their rights under the Ordinance, including a four-year (i.e. two years plus two years) security of tenure. He also stressed that the RVD will continue to take resolute enforcement action against any contraventions of the Ordinance. Apart from following up on reported cases, the RVD has been adopting a multipronged approach to proactively identify, investigate and follow up on cases concerning landlords who are suspected of contravening the Ordinance. In particular, the RVD has been requiring landlords of regulated tenancies to provide information and reference documents of their tenancies for checking whether they have complied with the requirements of the Ordinance. If a landlord, without reasonable excuse, refuses to provide the relevant information or neglects the RVD's request, the landlord commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine at level 3 ($10,000) and to imprisonment for three months. Depending on the actual circumstances, and having regard to the information and evidence collected, the RVD will take appropriate actions on individual cases, including instigating prosecution against suspected contraventions of the Ordinance. In addition, the RVD has started a new round of publicity and education work to enhance public awareness about the key offences and penalties, emphasising that the RVD proactively checks whether landlords have committed the offences under the Ordinance.

  To help curb illegal acts as soon as possible, members of the public should report to the RVD promptly any suspected cases of contravening the relevant requirements. Reporting can be made through the telephone hotline (2150 8303), by email (enquiries@rvd.gov.hk), by fax (2116 4920), by post (15/F, Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, 303 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon), or in person (visiting the Tenancy Services Section office of the RVD at Room 3816-22, 38/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, and please call 2150 8303 to make an appointment). Furthermore, the RVD has provided a form (Form AR4) (www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/ar4.pdf) on its website to enable SDU tenants' reporting to the RVD.

  The RVD reminds that pursuant to the Ordinance, a regulated cycle of regulated tenancies is to comprise two consecutive regulated tenancies (i.e. the first-term tenancy and second-term tenancy) for an SDU, and the term of each regulated tenancy is two years. A tenant of a first-term tenancy for an SDU is entitled to be granted a second-term tenancy of the regulated cycle, thus enjoying a total of four years of security of tenure. The RVD has been issuing letters enclosing relevant information to the landlords and tenants concerned of regulated tenancies in batches, according to the expiry time of their first-term tenancies, to assist them in understanding the important matters pertaining to the second-term tenancy, and to remind them about the procedures that need to be followed about two months prior to the commencement of the purported second-term tenancy as well as their respective obligations and rights under the Ordinance. These landlords and tenants may also visit the dedicated page for the second-term tenancy on the RVD's website (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html) for the relevant information, including a concise guide, brochures, tutorial videos and frequently asked questions. The landlords and tenants concerned are also advised to familiarise themselves with the relevant statutory requirements and maintain close communication regarding the second-term tenancy for handling the matters properly and in a timely manner according to the Ordinance.

  For enquiries related to regulated tenancies, please call the telephone hotline (2150 8303) or visit the RVD's webpage (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/our_services/part_iva.html) for the relevant information.

十二月份第三批涵蓋兩個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及24個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下，大部分地區更為0%，顯示白紋伊蚊的分布情況並不廣泛。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十二月共三批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共50個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年十一月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這50個監察區中，47個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有三區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

​食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

  Among the third batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering two survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering 24 survey areas in December, all were below 10 per cent and most of the areas recorded a zero per cent, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive.

  The FEHD has so far released three batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in December 2025, covering 50 survey areas. Among these 50 survey areas, 47 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. November 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Three other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

  The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

  Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-12-19 16:35,2025-12-19 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900618.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on December 18 to noon today (December 19), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 255 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit.

All the samples passed the tests."
Statistics on persons engaged and vacancies for September 2025,2025-12-19 16:30,2025-12-19 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900316.htm,"According to the statistics on persons engaged and vacancies (formerly known as employment and vacancies statistics) released today (December 19) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), total number of persons engaged in the private sector surveyed decreased by 0.4% or 11 300 persons in September 2025 compared with a year earlier. The total number of vacancies was 51 450, representing a decrease of 23% or 15 010 over the preceding year.

Persons engaged statistics

In September 2025, the selected industries as a whole engaged 2 710 200 persons. The import and export trade engaged 342 700 persons, followed by professional and business services (excluding cleaning and similar services) engaging 314 800 persons, financing and insurance 238 500 persons, retail trade 230 000 persons, and food and beverage services 217 500 persons.

Movements in the number of persons engaged in different surveyed industries varied when compared with a year earlier. Increases were mainly observed in the industries of human health services (3.6% or 5 700 persons), financing and insurance (3.5% or 8 000 persons), and manufacturing (2.1% or 1 600 persons). On the other hand, the number of persons engaged decreased mainly in the industries of construction sites (manual workers only) (-6.2% or -7 600 persons), import and export trade (-3.7% or -13 000 persons), retail trade (-3.0% or -7 100 persons), and cleaning and similar services (-2.6% or -2 200 persons). Number of persons engaged for selected major industries are shown in Table 1.

Vacancies statistics

Among the 51 450 private sector vacancies in September 2025, 5 860 were from the industry of financing and insurance, 5 260 from education, 5 120 from professional and business services (excluding cleaning and similar services), 4 830 from human health services, and 4 230 from residential care and social work services.

Vacancies decreased in majority of the selected industries in September 2025 over a year earlier. Decreases were mainly observed in the industries of transportation, storage, postal and courier services (-2 260 or -45%), food and beverage services (-1 820 or -33%), human health services (-1 760 or -27%), and arts, entertainment, recreation and other services (-1 620 or -38%). On the other hand, vacancies increased in the industries of financing and insurance (860 or 17%), and information and communications (260 or 11%). Job vacancies figures for selected major industries are shown in Table 2.

Analysed by major occupation category, private sector vacancies were observed mainly in the categories of service and sales workers (16 920 vacancies), professionals (9 580 vacancies), and associate professionals (9 340 vacancies). Job vacancies figures by major occupation category are shown in Table 3.

Seasonally adjusted statistics

For discerning the latest trend in the number of persons engaged and vacancies in the private sector, it is useful to look at changes over a three-month period in the respective seasonally adjusted figures. Compared with June 2025, the seasonally adjusted total number of persons engaged and total vacancies in the surveyed industries increased by 0.2% and decreased by 1.7% respectively in September 2025. The changes over three-month periods in the seasonally adjusted series of persons engaged and vacancies are shown in Table 4.

Other information

The above statistics on persons engaged and vacancies were obtained from the Quarterly Survey of Employment and Vacancies and the Quarterly Employment Survey of Construction Sites conducted by the C&SD. In the former survey, some economic activities (e.g. those dominated by self-employment, including taxi operators and hawkers) are not covered. Therefore, the respective figures for persons engaged and vacancies relate only to those selected industries included in the survey. In the latter survey on construction sites, the number of persons engaged and vacancies relate to manual workers only.

A detailed breakdown of the above statistics is published in the following reports:
""Quarterly Report of Persons Engaged and Vacancies Statistics, September 2025"" (formerly known as ""Quarterly Report of Employment and Vacancies Statistics"")

2026 Population Census to commence in January next year,2025-12-19 16:30,2025-12-19 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900315.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) announced today (December 19) that the 2026 Population Census will be conducted from January 1 to December 31, 2026.

  Speaking at a press conference, the Commissioner for Census and Statistics, Mr Leo Yu, remarked that the Census helps the Government to understand Hong Kong's demographic and socio-economic characteristics by providing vital statistical information for future planning and development. As a major step to modernise the mode of Hong Kong's population censuses, several re-engineering initiatives will be implemented from the 2026 Population Census to streamline and improve workflow. Every five years, the C&SD will randomly select only 10 per cent of households in Hong Kong for detailed enquiry. The remaining 90 per cent of households will not be required to fill out any questionnaire. In addition, while data collection will be conducted throughout the year, instead of concentrated within 1.5 months as in the past, selected households are only required to submit one questionnaire within the data collection period. Government administrative data will also be used more extensively to simplify the content of the questionnaire.

  Mr Yu emphasised that the C&SD strives to protect the data privacy of all persons and households. Information collected in the Census will be kept in strict confidence and only be used to compile aggregate statistics. Such information will not be disclosed to any unauthorised parties. All completed questionnaires will also be destroyed by December 31, 2027.

  About 10 per cent of households in Hong Kong (i.e. some 300 000 households) will be selected through random sampling to participate in the 2026 Population Census. The C&SD will issue notification letters in purple envelopes to the sampled households in batches starting from the end of this month.

  Sampled households (including owner-occupiers or tenants) who have received the notification letter can submit the required information via one of the following means:
(1) Completing the online questionnaire (by accessing the Online Questionnaire through scanning the QR code on the notification letter or visiting the website (oq.census2026.gov.hk)); or
(2) Conducting a telephone interview (by calling the Census Hotline at 18 2026).

  Sampled households are encouraged to complete the online Census questionnaire with ease by smartphones, desktop computers or mobile tablets. Census officers will also visit households with outstanding response and assist them in completing the questionnaire. When visiting households, census officers will wear a grey vest uniform, and carry an Enumerator Identity Card and a Census Officer Certificate of Identity issued by the C&SD for identification purposes.

  The C&SD reminds the public to be aware of scamming activities. Households will not be required to provide information on their Hong Kong identity card, bank accounts or credit cards in the Census. If households have not provided the C&SD with their contact information, the C&SD will not initiate calls, send emails or SMS messages to them. The caller ID ""18 2026"" or SMS sender ID ""#C&SD"" will be displayed when the C&SD calls or sends SMS messages to households in Hong Kong. To report suspected deception cases or verify the identity of census officers, members of the public should call the Census Hotline 18 2026.

  The Census Hotline will operate from 9 am to 10 pm from Monday to Friday (except public holidays) throughout the data collection period (from January to December 2026). Members of the public can call the Census Hotline at 18 2026 or visit the thematic webpage of the 2026 Population Census (www.census2026.gov.hk) for more information if they require assistance in completing the questionnaire.

  The Census is conducted under Section 9 of the Census and Statistics Ordinance (Cap. 316). All persons specified are obliged to provide the required information. It is an offence if any persons contravene the legal requirement for completing the Census questionnaire."

Red tides sighted,2025-12-19 16:30,2025-12-19 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900604.htm,"  Seven red tides were sighted during the past week, the Inter-departmental Red Tide Working Group reported today (December 19).

  On December 15, staff of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department spotted six red tides at Butterfly Beach, Cafeteria New Beach, Cafeteria Old Beach, Golden Beach, Castle Peak Beach and Kadoorie Beach in Tuen Mun, respectively. On December 17, another red tide was spotted at Deep Water Bay Beach in Southern District, Hong Kong Island.

  The red tides at Butterfly Beach, Castle Peak Beach and Deep Water Bay Beach still persist, while the other four red tides have dissipated. No associated fish deaths have been reported as of today.

  A spokesman for the working group said, ""All seven red tides were formed by Phaeocystis globosa, which is commonly found in Hong Kong waters. According to literature overseas, the algal species can produce foam that may affect fish.""

  The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) urged mariculturists at the Lo Tik Wan, Sok Kwu Wan and Po Toi fish culture zones to monitor the situation closely and increase aeration where necessary.

  Red tide is a natural phenomenon. The AFCD's proactive phytoplankton monitoring programme will continue to monitor red tide occurrences to minimise the impact on the mariculture industry and the public."
Statistics of Stored Value Facilities schemes issued by SVF licensees,2025-12-19 16:30,2025-12-19 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900542.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published today (December 19) statistics on Stored Value Facilities (SVF) schemes issued by SVF licensees for the third quarter of 2025.

The SVF scheme statistics (see Annex) include quarterly data on SVF schemes issued by the SVF licensees of the relevant periods.

According to the quarterly statistics, the total number of SVF accounts in use (Note 1) was 83.4 million at the end of Q3/2025, representing a 0.8 per cent increase from the previous quarter. The total number of SVF transactions was around 2.1 billion in Q3/2025, or 0.5per cent higher than the previous quarter. The total value of SVF transactions was HK$268.9 billion in Q3/2025, representing a 5.9per cent decrease from the previous quarter. Of the total transaction value, HK$45.2 billion was related to point-of-sale spending payment, HK$30.6 billion in online spending payment, HK$16.5 billion in P2P funds transfer, HK$65.4 billion in withdrawal and HK$111.2 billion in add value. The total float and SVF deposit (Note 2) was HK$20.7 billion at the end of Q3/2025, 1.7per cent higher than the previous quarter.

As compared with the end of Q3/2024, the total number of SVF accounts in use at the end of Q3/2025 was up by 7.7per cent, and the total float and SVF deposit was up by 11.8per cent. The total number and value of SVF transactions during Q3/2025 were up by 3.8per cent and 13.4per cent year-on-year respectively.

Note 1: ""Total number of SVF accounts in use"" refers to the total number of SVF accounts that can be used as at the end of the reporting period.

Note 2:The terms ""float"" and ""SVF deposit"" follow their definitions in the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance."
Statistics of payment cards issued in Hong Kong for third quarter 2025,2025-12-19 16:30,2025-12-19 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900553.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published today (December 19) statistics of payment cards issued in Hong Kong for the third quarter of 2025.

The payment card statistics (see Annex) include quarterly data on credit and debit cards issued in Hong Kong under the credit and/or debit card schemes of the eight payment card scheme operators (Note 1). The HKMA began to publish the payment card statistics on a quarterly basis in June 2010 to enhance transparency of the payment card industry in Hong Kong, in line with international practice.

According to the quarterly statistics, the total number of credit cards in circulation (Note 2) was 25.08 million by the end of Q3/2025. The figure represents a 10.0 per cent increase from the previous quarter and a 23.6per centincrease from the previous year. The number and value of credit card transactions (including retail sales and cash advances) (Note 3) are susceptible to seasonal factors and the general economic environment, making the trends more prone to fluctuation. The total number of credit card transactions was 382.61 million for Q3/2025, representing a 6.2per centincrease from the previous quarter and a 16.3per cent increase from the same period in 2024. The total value of credit card transactions was HK$285.6 billion for Q3/2025, representing a 6.4per cent increase from the previous quarter and a 14.8per centincrease from the same period in 2024. Of the total transaction value, HK$173.3 billion (60.7per cent) was related to retail spending in Hong Kong, HK$103.1 billion (36.1per cent) in retail spending overseas and HK$9.1 billion (3.2per cent) in cash advances.

The total number of debit cards in circulation is not available due to overlapping of debit card brands in a single card. Like the number and value of credit card transactions, the number and value of debit card transactions in relation to retail sales and bills payments (Note 4) are also affected by seasonal factors. On a quarterly basis, the total number of debit card transactions in relation to retail sales and bills payments decreased by 9.6per centto 52.31 million while the total value decreased by 5.6per cent to HK$62.7 billion in Q3/2025. When compared to the same period in 2024, the total number decreased by 3.2per centand the total value dropped by 8.3per cent in Q3/2025.

Note 1:The payment card statistics are compiled from data on credit and debit cards issued in Hong Kong by both authorized institutions (AIs) and non-authorized institutions (non-AIs) under the credit and/or debit card schemes of the eight payment card scheme operators (""the card operators""). The card operators, in alphabetical order, are American Express International, Inc., Discover Financial Services (Hong Kong) Limited, EPS Company (Hong Kong) Limited (EPSCO), JCB International (Asia) Ltd, Joint Electronic Teller Services Ltd. (JETCO), MasterCard Asia/Pacific Pte. Ltd., UnionPay International Co. Ltd and Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited.

Note 2: A credit card issued in Hong Kong only carries one credit card brand. The total number of credit cards in circulation refers to the total number of credit cards (i.e. cards with a credit function) issued in Hong Kong under the credit card schemes of card operators (but excluding EPSCO and JETCO, which do not operate a credit card scheme). Some of these credit cards carry debit card functions, i.e. the credit card can be used for making purchases/payments or cash withdrawal at ATMs through directly debiting cardholders' bank accounts.

Note 3: The total number/value of credit card transactions refer to the total number/value of transactions made via credit card accounts of credit cards issued in Hong Kong under the credit card schemes of card operators (excluding EPSCO and JETCO). Starting from March 2015, a Hong Kong/overseas spending breakdown of credit card retail sales transactions is provided.

Note 4: The total number/value of debit card transactions in relation to retail sales/bill payments refers to the total number/value of those transactions made via debiting cardholders' bank accounts. Some of the eight card operators do not operate a debit card scheme. Care should be exercised in combining the credit card retail sales figures and the debit card retail sales/bills payment figures because of the possibility of double counting."

二○二五年第三季在香港發行的支付卡的統計資料,2025-12-19 16:30,2025-12-19 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900549.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（十二月十九日）公布二○二五年第三季在香港發行的支付卡的統計資料。

支付卡統計資料（見附件）是根據八家支付卡計劃營運機構（註一）的信用卡及／或扣帳卡計劃所發行的信用卡及扣帳卡的季度資料編製而成。金管局在二○一○年六月開始按照國際慣例，公布支付卡的季度統計資料，以提高香港支付卡業務的透明度。

根據季度統計資料，於二○二五年第三季末，在市面流通的信用卡總數（註二）為2 508萬張，按季上升10.0%，按年上升23.6%。信用卡交易量及金額（包括零售銷售及現金貸款）（註三）容易受季節因素及整體經濟環境影響，走勢較為波動。在二○二五年第三季，信用卡總交易量為38 261萬宗，較上一季增加6.2%，較二○二四年同期則增加16.3%。二○二五年第三季的信用卡交易總額為2,856億港元，較上一季增加6.4%，與二○二四年同期比較增加14.8%。交易總額當中，1,733億港元（60.7%）為香港消費，1,031億港元（36.1%）為海外消費，91億港元 （3.2%）為現金貸款。

扣帳卡方面，由於同一張扣帳卡可包含多於一個扣帳卡品牌，因此難以計算在市面流通的扣帳卡總數。正如信用卡交易的情形一樣，涉及零售銷售及支付帳單的扣帳卡交易量及金額（註四）亦會受季節因素影響。在二○二五年第三季，涉及零售銷售及支付帳單的扣帳卡總交易量按季減少9.6%至5 231萬宗，總額則按季減少5.6%至627億港元。與二○二四年同期比較，二○二五年第三季的扣帳卡總交易量減少3.2%，總額減少8.3%。

註一：支付卡統計資料是根據認可機構及非認可機構在八家支付卡計劃營運機構（卡營運機構）的信用卡及／或扣帳卡計劃下、在香港發行的信用卡及扣帳卡的資料編製而成。該八家卡營運機構為美國運通國際股份有限公司、Discover Financial Services （Hong Kong） Limited、易辦事（香港）有限公司、JCB International （Asia） Ltd.、銀聯通寶有限公司、MasterCard Asia/Pacific Pte. Ltd.、銀聯國際有限公司、及Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited。
註二：在香港發行的信用卡每張僅包含一個信用卡品牌。在市面流通的信用卡總數是指根據卡營運機構（不包括易辦事及銀聯通寶，因這兩家機構沒有營運信用卡計劃）的信用卡計劃，在香港發行的信用卡（即具備信貸功能的卡）總數。部分信用卡亦具備扣帳卡功能，即有關信用卡可透過直接從持卡人銀行帳戶中扣帳的方式購物／付款或從自動櫃員機提款。
註三：信用卡交易的總宗數及總額，是指經由根據卡營運機構（不包括易辦事及銀聯通寶）的信用卡計劃在香港發行的信用卡的帳戶進行的交易的總宗數及總額。由二○一五年三月開始，已提供信用卡零售銷售交易有關香港／海外消費的細分數據。
註四：扣帳卡交易的總宗數及總額，指透過自持卡人銀行帳戶扣帳的方式進行的交易的總宗數及總額。在八家卡營運機構中，部分沒有營運扣帳卡計劃。合併計算信用卡零售銷售數字與扣帳卡零售銷售與支付帳單數字時要格外審慎，因為將兩者合併可能會出現重複計算的情況。"

按主要職業組別分析，私營機構的職位空缺主要為服務及銷售人員（16 920個）、專業人員（9 580個）和輔助專業人員（9 340個）。表3載列按主要職業組別劃分的職位空缺數字。

經季節性調整的統計數字

要辨識私營機構的從業人士及職位空缺統計數字的最新趨勢，可參閱經季節性調整後從業人數及職位空缺數字按三個月的變動。與二零二五年六月比較，二零二五年九月統計調查所涵蓋行業的總從業人數及職位空缺總數，經季節性調整後分別上升0.2%及下跌1.7%。表4載列經季節性調整後的從業人數及職位空缺數字按三個月的變動數列。

其他資料

上述有關從業人士及職位空缺的統計數字，是根據政府統計處的「僱傭及職位空缺按季統計調查」及「建築地盤就業人數按季統計調查」結果而編製。在首項統計調查中，部分經濟活動的從業人數並不包括在內，例如自僱情況較普遍的行業，包括的士從業員及小販。因此，有關的從業人士及職位空缺統計數字，只涉及統計調查所包括的選定行業。至於有關建築地盤的統計調查，其從業人數及職位空缺數目則只包括地盤工人。

二零二六年人口普查明年一月展開,2025-12-19 16:30,2025-12-19 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900297.htm,"政府統計處今日（十二月十九日）公布，二零二六年人口普查將於二零二六年一月一日至十二月三十一日期間進行。

統計處處長余振強在記者會上表示，人口普查為未來的規劃與發展提供重要的統計數據，有助政府了解本港人口及社會經濟特徵。作為推動本港人口普查模式現代化的重要一步，統計處將由二零二六年人口普查開始實施數項重整措施，以簡化和改善人口普查的工作流程。統計處每五年只會抽樣選出全港約一成住戶進行詳細訪問，其餘九成住戶則無須填報任何問卷。此外，儘管人口普查的資料搜集工作將由以往集中在一個半月內進行，改為分攤全年進行，獲選中的住戶在資料搜集期間只需填交一份問卷。統計處亦將更廣泛地運用政府行政數據簡化問卷內容。

余振強強調，統計處致力保障個人及住戶的資料私隱，人口普查搜集所得的資料會嚴加保密，只用作編製整體統計數字，不會向任何未獲授權的人士透露。所有已填報資料的問卷亦將於二零二七年十二月三十一日或之前銷毀。

統計處將以隨機抽樣方式選出全港約一成住戶（即約三十萬個住戶）參與二零二六年人口普查，並由本月底起分批向獲選中的住戶發出紫色信封的通知信。

獲選中的住戶（包括自住業主或租客）在接獲通知信後，可以透過以下其中一種方式提交所需資料：
（一）填交網上問卷（掃瞄通知信上的二維碼，或到訪網站（oq.census2026.gov.hk）進入「網上問卷」）；或
（二）進行電話訪問（致電普查熱線18 2026）。

統計處鼓勵獲選中的住戶使用智能電話、桌面電腦或平板電腦便捷地填交網上普查問卷。處方亦會安排統計員到訪未回覆的住戶協助完成問卷。統計員在上門訪問時會身穿灰色背心制服，並攜帶統計員身份證及由統計處簽發的統計員身份證明書，以供識別。

統計處提醒市民慎防詐騙活動。人口普查不會要求住戶提供香港身份證、銀行戶口或信用卡資料，統計處亦不會主動致電、發送電子郵件或文字短訊給未有向處方提供聯絡資料的住戶。當統計處致電或發送文字短訊給香港境內的住戶時，會顯示來電號碼18 2026或短訊發送人名稱「#C&SD」。如市民懷疑遇到詐騙或需核實統計員的身分，應致電普查熱線18 2026。

普查熱線將於資料搜集期內（即二零二六年一月至十二月）逢星期一至五（公眾假期除外）上午九時至晚上十時運作。如市民在填交問卷時需要協助，可致電普查熱線18 2026，或瀏覽二零二六年人口普查主題網頁（www.census2026.gov.hk）獲取更多資訊。

人口普查是根據《普查及統計條例》（第316章）第9條的規定進行。所有指定人士必須提供所需資料。任何人士違反填交人口普查問卷的法律規定，即屬犯罪。"

"Speech by SJ at 5th International Forum on ""Problem-Solving City: Hong Kong as a Disputes Resolver"" (English only)(with photo)",2025-12-19 16:28,2025-12-19 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900569.htm,"  Following is the keynote speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the 5th International Forum on ""Problem-Solving City: Hong Kong as a Disputes Resolver"" today (December 19):

Ms Maria Tam (Deputy Secretary-General of the Hong Kong Coalition), Professor Herman Hu (Chairman of Friday Culture Limited), Mr Nick Chan (Director of the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

A very good afternoon. I am very grateful to have the opportunity to speak at the 5th International Forum, co-organised by Friday Culture Limited, the Hong Kong Coalition and the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre. I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to the organisers for their ongoing efforts in hosting this event.

  This year's theme, ""Problem-Solving City: Hong Kong as a Disputes Resolver, Transnational Connector and Cultural Bridge"", aptly captures one of Hong Kong's unique roles and is especially relevant at a time of global uncertainty. As economies and communities around the world navigate post-pandemic recovery, rapid digitalisation, and shifting geopolitical landscapes, the ability to connect, mediate, and build trust across boundaries is essential.

  Hong Kong has long been recognised as a premier global hub for dispute resolution, supported by a robust legal framework, world-class institutions and professional talent, as well as an independent and efficient judiciary. The establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) Headquarters in Hong Kong further reinforces Hong Kong's status as a centre for peaceful dispute resolution. As the world's first intergovernmental legal institution dedicated to resolving international disputes through mediation, the IOMed provides an additional avenue for handling disputes between states, between a state and foreign nationals, as well as international commercial disputes.

  On the other hand, Hong Kong continues to serve as a transnational connector and cultural bridge, linking East and West through its strategic location, multilingual environment, and active participation in initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative. This blend of Chinese heritage and international vision enables the city to act as a gateway connecting the Chinese Mainland with the world, fostering mutual understanding and forging enduring partnerships with the global community.

  Today's programme, with its two engaging panels: ""Mediating Disputes in Sports"" and ""Setting and Harmonising Standards for Web 3.0"", offers a timely opportunity for thoughtful exchange. Please allow me to offer a few very brief observations ahead of the discussions by the panellists.

Mediating disputes in sports

  With the hosting of competition events during the 15th National Games and the opening of the Kai Tak Sports Park, Hong Kong's sports sector is experiencing continuous development. As the industry grows, so does the need for effective dispute resolution services tailored to address sports-related issues, from commercial and contractual disputes to competition and governance issues.

  A dedicated and streamlined mechanism for resolving sports-related disputes is pivotal to advancing Hong Kong's sports development. Delays in resolution can derail a sportsman's career or disrupt the operation of a sports organisation. A reliable and effective dispute resolution framework will not only safeguard the interests of the sportsmen and sports bodies but also increase confidence, stability and professionalism across the sector. As an international legal and dispute resolution services centre, Hong Kong is well positioned to become a trusted hub for sports dispute resolution.

  Globally, the sports dispute resolution landscape has made considerable progress. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) headquartered in Switzerland, with its global network of arbitrators and mediators, provides structured mechanisms for adjudicating sports disputes efficiently and transparently. On the Chinese Mainland, the establishment of the China Commission of Arbitration for Sport (CCAS) under the revised Sports Law represents another significant step, laying the foundation for a comprehensive sports dispute resolution system in our country. These experiences offer valuable reference points for Hong Kong.

  During my duty visit to Europe earlier this year, I had the opportunity to visit the office of the French National and Olympic Sports Committee (CNOSF) and meet with representatives from the Chamber of Arbitration for Sport and the Conference of Conciliators of the CNOSF. These exchanges offered valuable insights into the committee's services in sports arbitration and conciliation and highlighted the importance of nurturing a collaborative culture, in which dialogue and mutual understanding form the foundation of effective sports dispute resolution. This experience has further reinforced my belief in the importance of fostering a similar culture of structured and proactive resolution in Hong Kong.

  The Hong Kong Government has indeed been proactive in developing a dedicated sports dispute resolution system. The Department of Justice (DoJ) worked closely with the sports and legal communities to establish the Pilot Scheme on Sports Dispute Resolution, which was a key policy initiative under the Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address. I am glad that the Pilot Scheme was formally launched about a week ago on December 11. The Pilot Scheme incorporates a ""mediation first, arbitration next"" process, thus reinforcing the efficacy of mediation for resolving sports disputes. We are confident that mediation is particularly fitting given its speed and cost efficiency, its capacity to preserve relationships, as well as its potential to deliver creative and practical solutions.

  In fact, we consider that the said initiative goes beyond a policy measure - fundamentally speaking, it is about culture building. To work towards this direction, the DoJ has long been committed to promoting the wider use of mediation in Hong Kong and deepening the mediation culture, and we see significant value in extending this to the sports sector. Please rest assured that we will continue to engage in dialogue and collaboration with partners across sectors to raise awareness and nurture talent in sports dispute resolution through educational programmes and promotional events, with the goal of cultivating a healthy and sustainable sports ecosystem grounded in knowledge, professionalism and trust.

  Today's panel on ""Mediating Disputes in Sports"" brings together sports industry leaders, elite athletes and legal experts to share perspectives on the growing importance of mediation in sports. Their insights will shed light on how a robust, fair and efficient dispute resolution system can benefit our sporting community, thereby paving the way for Hong Kong to become a trusted hub for sports dispute resolution.

Setting and harmonising standards for Web 3.0

  The second panel discussion is about setting and harmonising standards for Web 3.0. Web 3.0 represents the latest generation of the Internet, characterised by decentralisation, blockchain technology and user sovereignty. With Web 3.0, users have greater control over their data and transactions, fostering trust and transparency through cryptographic mechanisms. Coupled with the development of artificial intelligence, Web 3.0 has opened up new applications and opportunities to various sectors, including the legal and dispute resolution industry.

  Web 3.0 technologies enhance enforceability and transparency in contractual obligations and create further synergy when integrated with AI. Take smart contracts as an example. Smart contracts are digital agreements stored on a blockchain, and they execute automatically. They often incorporate key contractual clauses such as dispute resolution and governing law clauses. AI smart contracts can even analyse data, adapt to different contexts and improve accuracy in future decision-making when executing the contracts. Electronic evidence is another good example. Electronic evidence can be verified using blockchain timestamping. AI can supplement it by accurately identifying, extracting and analysing digital evidence, hence ensuring the integrity and admissibility of electronic evidence. It is therefore essential for legal professionals to understand the implications and embrace these technologies to enhance efficiency in their practice.

  The Government has been proactive in supporting the development of Web 3.0 in Hong Kong. In 2022, the Policy Statement on Development of Virtual Assets in Hong Kong was issued by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau to set out the policy stance and approach towards developing a vibrant sector and ecosystem for virtual assets in Hong Kong. Version 2.0 of the Statement was then released in June this year. The Task Force on Promoting Web3 Development, chaired by the Financial Secretary, was also established in 2023 to provide the Government with recommendations on the sustainable and responsible development of Web 3.0. With all the efforts made as aforementioned, the Stablecoins Ordinance (Cap. 656) came into effect on August 1, 2025, with a view to facilitating the sustainable development of the stablecoin and digital asset ecosystem in Hong Kong by introducing a licensing regime for fiat-referenced stablecoin issuers.

  The DoJ has also actively promoted the use of Web 3.0 technologies in the legal and dispute resolution industry. With our support, eBRAM International Online Dispute Resolution Centre (eBRAM) was established to provide online dispute resolution (ODR) services. Since May 2022, eBRAM has developed a series of ODR platforms, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ODR Platform, an online arbitration platform, an online mediation platform, and the Deal-Making Portal, so as to facilitate business transactions and access to justice. In particular, eBRAM's Deal-Making Portal provides a set of comprehensive tools for cross-border dispute resolution and deal-making using Web 3.0 technologies such as smart contracts.

  Earlier this year, we also set up the Consultation Group on LawTech Development, which will be responsible for giving advices on the formulation of policies and measures regarding lawtech. With the support of the Consultation Group, we have organised four rounds of the LexGoTech Roundtables Series and released a report on the discussions. To further demonstrate our efforts on legal technology development, we organised the inaugural Hong Kong LawTech Fest earlier this month as part of the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025.

  Apart from promoting the integration of technology and AI in the legal sector, we are taking on a pivotal role in building the broader legal regime for AI governance as mentioned in the 2025 Policy Address. We will co-ordinate an interdepartmental working group to co-ordinate the responsible bureaux to review the legislation needed to complement the wider application of AI. This initiative aims to provide a facilitative yet properly controlled legal environment for the development of AI.

  Furthermore, the combination of Web 3.0 and AI offers opportunities for resolving legal disputes by enhancing efficiency and lowering costs. I am confident that the panel will share more insights on why and how the standards for Web 3.0 should be set and harmonised so as to strengthen Hong Kong's position as a global hub for legal and technological innovation.

  In closing, I wish to express my heartfelt appreciation again to all organisers, speakers and participants for their dedication to advancing dialogue and innovation. The strength of Hong Kong lies not only in our institutions and infrastructure but, more importantly, also in our people - their openness, professionalism and shared belief in the value of co-operation. Together, we will continue to build a city that connects cultures, bridges differences and contributes meaningfully to the global peace and development.

  May I wish you all a very constructive forum this afternoon."

Court makes review decision on sentencing for violating occupational safety and health legislation,2025-12-19 16:20,2025-12-19 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900559.htm,"  âRegarding the sentencing in a fatal industrial accident, the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (December 19) handed down a review decision, accepting the prosecution's application for review of an earlier court sentence and increasing the fines imposed on the employer.
  
  The case involved a fatal accident that occurred on March 14, 2024, at a warehouse in Sandy Ridge, New Territories. While a worker was operating a fork-lift truck for unloading of wooden battens from the trailer of a truck, a bundle of wooden battens fell from the trailer and struck another worker. The concerned worker sustained an injury and passed away on the same day.
  
  Kinform Timber Company Limited, being the employer of the fork-lift truck operator, was prosecuted by the Labour Department (LD) for violation of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, and was fined $120,000 at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts on January 21, 2025.
  
  After the sentencing, the prosecution filed a review application with the court regarding the sentence imposed on the relevant employer. The review hearing was brought up today before the Fanling Magistrates' Courts. The fine imposed on Kinform Timber Company Limited was increased to $160,000.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that the ruling will disseminate a strong message to all employers that they have to protect workers' safety and health at work in accordance with the laws. The prosecution will continue to pay attention to court rulings and will file review or appeal applications for cases where the sentences are manifestly inadequate and/or wrong in principle."

Public urged to guard against fake messages on Guangdong-Hong Kong Regular Quotas,2025-12-19 16:12,2025-12-19 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900561.htm,"  A spokesman for the Transport Department (TD) today (December 19) reminded members of the public to guard against and avoid being misled by recent fake messages on social media claiming that Hong Kong residents may apply for valid permanent Guangdong-Hong Kong Regular Quotas for their vehicles by their Mainland Travel Permits for Hong Kong and Macao Residents (commonly known as Home Return Permits).

  The spokesman clarified that applicants for the Regular Quotas have to meet the application requirements stipulated by the Mainland authority and provide the Mainland authority with the specified documents (such as business registration documents of both Guangdong and Hong Kong) to apply for the Regular Quotas. Upon receipt of the Mainland Approval Notice from the Mainland authority, they may apply to the TD for Closed Road Permits for the designated land-based boundary control points.

  The spokesman stressed that the arrangements of the Regular Quotas must be jointly deliberated by the governments of the two places holistically. Citizens should refer to official announcements and verify messages to avoid deception or disruption to their travel plans."
HA activates service demand surge special measures,2025-12-19 16:00,2025-12-19 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900497.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The Hospital Authority (HA) announced today (December 19) that public hospitals will activate service demand surge special measures starting Sunday (December 21). The HA anticipates increased service demand at public hospitals during the Christmas and New Year holidays and will closely monitor hospital operations.

The HA Chief Manager (Cluster Performance), Dr Larry Lee, said, ""Public hospitals will implement special measures to cope with increasing service demand for Accident and Emergency Departments (A&Es) and inpatient services, including enhanced manpower, bed capacity, and laboratory testing services for influenza and other viruses. Hospital command centres will co-ordinate discharge procedures and support arrangements for admissions, discharges and transfers to ensure that patients receive timely and appropriate treatment and that beds are available for new admissions. Also, public hospitals will reduce medical elective admissions after long holidays and open extra sessions for fractured hip surgeries during long holidays as and when necessary. Meanwhile, Community Geriatric Assessment Teams will strengthen support for residential care homes for the elderly, such as increasing visits, to reduce pressure on A&E attendance and unnecessary hospitalisation.""

The HA will implement special refund arrangements in the A&Es during the service demand surge period to provide stable patients with flexibility in choosing alternative medical care. While waiting for medical consultation at A&Es, patients who wish to seek treatment at other healthcare institutions can raise a refund request for the A&E charges directly from staff on duty at the registration counter. ""HA Go"" members may also submit refund applications through the HA mobile app ""HA Go"". This arrangement applies only to patients who have not been attended to by doctors, and applications must be made within 24 hours of registration. Eligible applicants will receive the refund in approximately one month by cheque by mail, credit card or electronic wallet. The special refund arrangements will be implemented until December 31, which will be replaced by the A&E refund arrangement under the Public Healthcare Fees and Charges Reform on January 1, 2026.

  Family Medicine Outpatient Services have been enhanced in order to cope with the service needs from members of the public and to alleviate the service pressure on A&Es during the Christmas long holidays. A total of 18 Family Medicine Clinics (FMCs) will provide public holiday FMC services during the Christmas holidays (December 25 and 26) (see table below). Patients may book an appointment either through the telephone appointment system or the ""Book FMC"" function of the ""HA Go"" mobile app.

The Chinese Medicine Clinics cum Training and Research Centres (CMCTRs) located in the 18 districts will also enhance government-subsidised Chinese medicine outpatient services on December 24, 27 and 29 to meet public demand. Patients may make an appointment either by telephone during service hours or through the ""18 CM Clinics"" mobile app (applicable to patients who have registered for 18 CMCTRs service). Please refer to the latest information on Chinese medicine services on the HA CMK website (cmk.ha.org.hk/christmas-2025).

The HA urges non-emergency patients to avoid using A&E services and instead seek treatment at FMCs, private doctors or 24-hour outpatient services at private hospitals to reduce pressure on public hospital A&Es. Members of the public can visit the Health Bureau (HHB)'s Primary Care Directory (www.pcdirectory.gov.hk). The HHB has also collated information of private hospitals, healthcare facilities, family doctors and Chinese medicine clinics that will be in operation during the 2025 Christmas and 2026 New Year holidays across the city. The information (including addresses, phone numbers and operation hours) of the relevant hospitals and clinics have been uploaded to the online portal (www.map.gov.hk/gm/s/hhbclinic/all?lg=en) for public reference in collaboration with the Spatial Data Office of the Development Bureau and the Lands Department.

As Hong Kong is currently in the influenza season, the HA reminds the public to maintain personal and environmental hygiene during the holidays to prevent disease transmission. People with respiratory symptoms should wear masks and seek medical attention promptly. Eligible persons, particularly those in high-risk groups, should get vaccinated early for seasonal influenza and COVID-19 to reduce the chance of infection for themselves and their family members, as well as to reduce the risk of critical illness and death after infection.

Grading of beach water quality released,2025-12-19 16:00,2025-12-19 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900357.htm,"âThe Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (December 19) released the latest grading of water quality for six gazetted beaches that are open all year round for swimming.

Four beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1), and two as Fair (Grade 2).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Golden Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Silverstrand Beach




Grade 2 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Lido Beach




  Compared with the grading released last week, there was no change in the grading for these beaches.

Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast)."
"Speech by SFST at International Forum ""Problem-Solving City: Hong Kong as a Disputes Resolver"" (English only)",2025-12-19 16:00,2025-12-19 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900323.htm,"Following is the pre-recorded video speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the International Forum ""Problem-Solving City: Hong Kong as a Disputes Resolver"" today (December 19):

Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests,

It is a great honour to address you for this esteemed forum, ""Problem-Solving City: Hong Kong as a Disputes Resolver"". I extend my sincere thanks to the organisers - the Hong Kong Coalition, Friday Culture Limited, and the AALCO (Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization) Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre - for convening this timely event. While I am not with you at the event physically due to other commitments, I know you are gathering at the historic Former French Mission Building, and it is a symbol of Hong Kong's rich heritage and forward-looking spirit, reminding us of our city's unique ability to bridge traditions and innovations. I also commend my colleague, the Secretary for Justice, for his insightful keynote earlier, which set a strong foundation for discussions on dispute resolution. I am delighted to share the Government's vision and policy measures with you that align with the forum's key themes, particularly in fostering standards and resolutions in emerging sectors such as Web 3.0 and digital assets.

Hong Kong has long been recognised as a global problem solver, leveraging our robust legal framework and international connectivity to resolve disputes across borders and industries. This role extends beyond traditional arbitration and mediation into the financial and technological realms, where rapid evolution demands proactive governance. The forum's focus on mediating disputes in sports and setting standards for Web 3.0 resonates deeply with the Government's commitment to creating an ecosystem that promotes fairness, innovation, and sustainable growth. In sports, effective mediation ensures that conflicts do not hinder athletic progress or international collaboration. Similarly, in the digital economy, harmonising standards is essential to mitigate risks, build trust, and resolve potential disputes before they escalate. Our policies are designed to position Hong Kong not only as a dispute resolver but as a proactive architect of global standards, ensuring that economic activities thrive in a regulated yet dynamic environment.

Central to this vision is our dedication to developing a trusted and innovative digital asset ecosystem. In June this year, my bureau issued the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong, building upon the foundational measures from the inaugural statement from 2022. This 2.0 statement reinforces our commitment to establishing Hong Kong as a global hub for digital asset innovation. It introduces the ""LEAP"" framework, which emphasises Legal and regulatory streamlining, Expanding tokenised products, Advancing use cases through cross-sectoral collaboration, and developing People and partnerships. This approach directly addresses the need for harmonised standards in Web 3.0, where decentralised technologies like blockchain and tokenisation present both opportunities and challenges in dispute resolution.

One of the cornerstones of our regulatory enhancements is the Stablecoins Ordinance, which came into effect on August 1 this year. This legislation establishes a licensing regime for issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins, ensuring that any entity issuing such assets in Hong Kong, or marketing them to our public, obtains approval from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Guided by the principle of ""same activity, same risks, same regulation"", we adopt a risk-based approach that aligns with international standards while reflecting local circumstances. The HKMA's stablecoin issuer sandbox, launched last year, has allowed institutions from diverse sectors - including banking and technology - to test business models in a controlled environment. By end-September this year, we received 36 licence applications from a broad spectrum of applicants, and we anticipate granting a handful of licenses in early next year, prioritising robust reserve management, price stabilisation, and anti-money laundering measures. These steps not only protect investors but also facilitate the resolution of potential disputes by embedding clear compliance pathways, reducing ambiguities that could lead to conflicts in transactions.

Furthermore, we are advancing regulatory regimes for digital asset dealing and custodian service providers. Following public consultations, my bureau, in collaboration with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), are formulating details for licensing regimes, with a bill targeted for introduction to the Legislative Council next year. This comprehensive framework will cover key nodes in the digital asset industry, balancing risk management with innovation. In parallel, the licensing regime for digital asset trading platforms, operational since June 2023 under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, has seen 11 platforms licensed. Recent circulars from the SFC allow these platforms to share global order books and expand offerings, enhancing liquidity and connectivity. Such frameworks and measures ensure that disputes arising from trading or custody are resolved efficiently through established regulatory channels, reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a dispute resolver in the digital space.

Tokenisation of real-world assets is another pivotal area where our policies promote harmonisation and dispute prevention. The SFC's circulars in November 2023 and the HKMA's guidance in February last year provide clarity on tokenised securities and custodial services, enabling banks and intermediaries to engage safely. Last year, we authorised the first retail tokenised gold product and five tokenised money market funds, with assets under management reaching $4 billion in August this year. The Project Ensemble Sandbox, launched by the HKMA in August last year with the SFC as a key partner, tests tokenisation use cases, paving the way for innovative financial infrastructure. These initiatives extend to Web 3.0 by standardising tokenisation processes, which can minimise disputes over asset ownership or valuations through transparent, blockchain-based records.

Our efforts also encompass intermediaries providing digital asset services. A joint circular from the SFC and the HKMA was updated in 2023 allowing retail access to dealing, advisory, and asset management services. We have pioneered the listing of digital asset futures ETFs (exchange-traded fund) in December 2022, spot ETFs in April last year, and an inverse product in July last year. The SFC's ""ASPIRe"" roadmap, announced in February this year, facilitates staking, borrowing, and lending services, with guidance issued to manage risks. These policies ensure that Web 3.0 participants operate under consistent rules, facilitating mediation and resolution when issues arise.

Beyond digital assets, our broader policies strengthen Hong Kong as an international financial centre and our country's global financial gateway, as outlined in the 14th Five-Year Plan. Measures like enhancing stock market competitiveness - through the Technology Enterprises Channel, optimising listing rules, and facilitating overseas listings - bolster our platform for resolving financial disputes. Expansions in mutual access schemes, such as Swap Connect enhancements this year, including extended tenors and increased quotas, deepen connectivity. In green and sustainable finance, the Government Sustainable Bond Programme has issued bonds equivalent to $250 billion as of November this year, with innovative tokenised issuances.

In conclusion, the Hong Kong Government's policy measures are meticulously crafted to harmonise standards in Web 3.0 and digital assets, positioning our city as a premier dispute resolver. By prioritising investor protection, regulatory clarity, and international alignment, we create an environment where innovation flourishes without compromising stability. Together, we can ensure Hong Kong remains a beacon of problem-solving in the global arena. Thank you."

醫院管理局啓動服務需求高峰期特別措施,2025-12-19 16:00,2025-12-19 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900490.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）今日（十二月十九日）公布，公立醫院會在周日（十二月二十一日）啓動服務需求高峰期特別措施。醫管局預計，公立醫院服務需求將於聖誕節和元旦假期增加，屆時會密切監察各醫院的運作情況。

醫管局總行政經理（聯網運作）李立業醫生說︰「公立醫院會採取特別措‍施應對急症室及住院服務需求上升，包括加強人手和病床，亦會透過醫院指揮中心協調出院流程，支援入院、出院及轉‍院等各項安排，務求讓病人更快得到適切的治療和盡量騰出病床接收新‍入院病人。公立醫院亦會減少長假期後的內科非緊急入院數目及按需要於長假期期間加開髖關節骨折手術節‍數。此外，社區老人評估小組將加強對安老院舍的支援，包括增加探訪安老院舍，以減低院舍病人前往急症室求診的壓力及減少病人非必要住‍院。」

醫‍管‍局亦會在服務需求高峰期期間推行急症室特別退款安排，以方便病情穩定的病人彈性選擇其他就診安排。病人在急症室等候醫生診症期間，如欲選‍擇轉到其他醫療機構求診，可於登記處直接向當值職員提出申請退回已繳交的急症室收費。「HA Go」會員亦可透過醫管局流動應用程式「HA Go」提交申請。有關安排只適用於未接受醫生診症的病人，並須在登記後24‍小時內提出申請，合資格的申請者將會在大約一個月內透過郵寄支票、信用卡或電子錢包方式收到退款。有關特別退款安排將會實行至十二月三十一日，並會在明年一‍月一日由公營醫療收費改革的急症室恆常退款機制取‍代。

為應對市民在聖誕長假期的求診需要及減輕急症室的服務壓力，醫管局已加強家庭醫學門診服務，聖誕假期期間（十二月二十五日及二十六日）將有18‍間家庭醫學診所提供公眾假期家庭醫學門診服務（詳見下表）。求診人士可透過電話預約系統或「HA Go」流動應用程式內的「預約家庭醫學診所」功能，預約診症時間。

18區中醫診所暨教研中心（中醫診所）亦將於十二月二十四、二十七及二十九日加強政府資助中醫門診服務，應對市民的求診需要。求診人士可於中醫診所的服務時間致電或使用「18區中醫診所」流動應用程式（適用於曾登記使用18區中醫診所服務的求診人士）預約服務。市民亦可瀏覽醫管局中醫動網頁（cmk.ha.org.hk/christmas-2025）獲取有關中醫服務的最新資訊。

醫管局呼籲非緊急的病人應避免使用急症室，盡量向家庭醫學診所、私家醫生及私家醫院24小時門診求診，以減輕公立醫院急症室的壓力。市民可瀏覽醫務衞生局基層醫療指南www.pcdirectory.gov.hk。醫務衞生局亦已整合全港18區將在二○二五年聖誕節及二○二六年元旦假期應診的私家醫院、醫療機構、家庭醫生和中醫診所的資料，並與發展局空間數據辦事處和地政總署合作，將相關醫院及診所的資料（包括地址、電話及應診時段等）上載至網上平台（www.map.gov.hk/gm/s/hhbclinic/all?lg=tc），供市民參‍考。

鑑於現時本港仍處於流感季節，醫管局提醒市民在假日期間注意個人及環境衞生，避免傳播疾病。市民如出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上口罩及盡快求醫。同時，合資格人士應及早接種流感及新冠疫苗，特別是高風險群組人‍士，減低自己和家人的感染機會，並降低感染後可能引致重症甚至死亡的風險。

環保署有條件批准牛潭尾地區發展環境影響評估報告,2025-12-19 15:42,2025-12-19 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900503.htm,"環境保護署（環保署）公布，環保署署長昨日（十二月十八日）就土木工程拓展署（土拓署）根據《環境影響評估條例》（《環評條例》）提出的申請，有條件批准「牛潭尾地區發展」環境影響評估（環評）報告。

「牛潭尾地區發展」屬於《環評條例》附表3的指定工程項目覆蓋面積超過50公頃的市區發展工程項目或重建工程項目。發展項目包括附表2的指定工程項目，須就其建造和營運取得環境許可證，包括新區域幹道和部分牛潭尾排水道活化及河道改道工程。

土拓署根據《環評條例》於二○二五年十月六日至十一月四日期間將該環評報告公開予公眾查閱。於公眾查閱期間，環保署共收到七份公眾意見。環境諮詢委員會（環諮會）轄下的環評小組於二○二五年十二月五日的會議詳細討論該環評報告及主要的公眾意見。其後，環諮會於二○二五年十二月十一日的會議上，一致通過建議環保署有條件批准該環評報告。

環保署發言人表示，環保署署長認為該工程項目透過實施環評報告建議的緩解措施，能為當區帶來多項環境效益，包括處理現時項目範圍內零散及雜亂的棕地作業所產生的不良環境影響，以提升土地使用效率和改善區內整體環境；另外，透過擴闊及活化牛潭尾排水道成為一條多功能藍綠走廊，可提升項目範圍內及附近的生態價值及功能。此外，工程項目透過濕地補償，連接附近獨立的濕地，能提高整體生態價值。

發言人強調，環保署已全面考慮相關環評研究概要和《環境影響評估程序的技術備忘錄》的要求、於公眾查閱期間由公眾提出有關環境及生態影響的意見、環保團體就該環評報告提出的建議及數據，包括由世界自然（香港）基金會發表的《香港生物多樣性現狀2025》研究報告、土拓署在環諮會會議上的回應，以及環諮會提出的意見及建議批准該環評報告的條件。環保署最終決定有條件批准該份環評報告。

批准條件主要包括要求土拓署：
（i）按照環評報告的建議，在建造工程開展前不少於三個月，就濕地補償向環保署署長提交詳細的《生境創造及管理計劃》，以供批准，並諮詢漁農自然護理署（漁護署）；
（ii）在建造工程開展前不少於三個月向環保署署長提交牛潭尾排水道《生態優化措施設計實施計劃》，以供批准，並諮詢相關政府部門（包括漁護署、渠務署及規劃署）；
（iii）設立一個具代表性的環境委員會，負責就《生境創造及管理計劃》及《生態優化措施設計實施計劃》的制定，及根據環評報告及已獲批准的上述兩份計劃內建議的生態緩解／優化措施的實施成效，提供專業及持份者意見；以及
（iv）在建造工程開展前，向環保署署長提交工程項目範圍內建築物及隔音屏障的《鳥類友善設計指引》。

此外，土拓署須檢視各項計劃的實施進度、環境監測結果及生態緩解／優化措施的成效。環保署會繼續與相關政府部門緊密聯繫，跟進上述各項批准條件。

環保署已將獲批淮的環評報告和批准報告的附帶條件，上載至《環評條例》網頁（www.epd.gov.hk/eia/tc/index.html）。公眾亦可到灣仔修頓中心二十七樓《環評條例》登記冊辦事處查閱有關文件。"

Local undergraduate students are welcome to apply.

In the 2025 Policy Address, the Chief Executive emphasised that the Government would continue to promote youth development. This includes providing more opportunities for young people to participate in the internships of international organisations and attend international conferences, in order to broaden their international horizons and cultivate a holistic outlook. The HYAB - United Nations Volunteer Internship Programme provides local undergraduate students with valuable opportunities to undertake six-month volunteer internships in the overseas field units of various United Nations (UN) agencies. Interns will be able to develop their personal capacities and gain insights into global issues, as well as contribute to the international community as Chinese youth volunteers. So far, around 150 students have participated in the Programme. The selected university students for the Programme in 2025 undertook internships in UN agencies located in different countries, including the UN Development Programme, the UN Children's Fund, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN. By participating in international affairs, they contributed their expertise and acquired valuable work experience in international organisations.

The new round of the Programme will offer a total of 20 internship placements in different UN agencies located in the Belt and Road region, including Kazakhstan, Laos, Nepal, Thailand, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. The volunteer internships will cover specific areas, such as health and education, environment and innovation management, and will run from July to December 2026. Applicants should be full-time undergraduate students of local universities. The HYAB will provide full funding, including round-trip air tickets and monthly living allowances, and offer suitable pre-departure training for participants in collaboration with the AVS.

Customs officers intercepted a 62-year-old incoming female passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point yesterday (December 18), and seized 381 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $1,500 and a duty potential of about $1,200 from her. She was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

註：如市民及工商機構於二○二六年一月三日前、一月八日至二十日期間需要回收聖誕樹，請於辦公時間內（星期一至星期六，上午九時至下午六時，公眾假期除外）送往Y‧PARK［林‧區］回收。

環保署發言人表示，是次計劃只限於回收天然聖誕樹，聖誕樹在送往回收前須拆除燈飾、膠底座、裝飾物及膠帶等物品，以免影響回收再造的過程。至於塑膠製的聖誕樹及裝飾物則可貯存再用，以實踐惜物減廢，而其他小型植物（如聖誕花）則可以重新栽種。

凡於中央收集站或回收環保站回收聖誕樹的參與者均會獲發電子證書；而將聖誕樹運往回收環保站回收的參與者亦可獲得小禮物乙份，數量有限，送完即止。有關天然聖誕樹回收計劃的詳細資料，可瀏覽香港減廢網站www.wastereduction.gov.hk/zh-hk/article/2025-26-natural-christmas-trees-recycling-programme。

環保署亦歡迎其他團體或組織提供聖誕樹回收服務，以便更多市民及工商機構參與，齊心協力，全民減廢。"

海關早前根據情報分析，並在版權擁有人的協助下，鎖定多間涉嫌於業務過程中管有和提供侵權卡拉OK歌曲予顧客使用的派對房間。海關人員遂採取執法行動，在全港多區，包括觀塘、九龍灣、新蒲崗、旺角、長沙灣、葵涌及元朗，突擊搜查八間派對房間，並檢獲八套用作播放懷疑侵權歌曲的卡拉OK播放機、一套懷疑侵權遊戲機套裝和一批影音器材，估計市值共約二十四萬元。海關以涉嫌觸犯《版權條例》拘捕兩名男派對房間負責人，年齡分別為27歲及42歲。兩名被捕人士現正保釋候查，案件仍在調查中，不排除有更多人被捕。

Hong Kong Customs combats provision of infringing karaoke songs by party rooms in course of business (with photo),2025-12-19 11:05,2025-12-19 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900256.htm,"  Hong Kong Customs mounted a territory-wide enforcement operation codenamed ""Magpie"" between December 3 and 10 to combat illegal activities involving party room operators providing infringing karaoke songs to customers in the course of business.

  Through intelligence analysis and with the assistance of copyright owners, Customs earlier identified a number of party rooms suspected of possessing and providing infringing karaoke songs to customers in the course of business. Customs officers then took enforcement action and raided eight party rooms in various districts, including Kwun Tong, Kowloon Bay, San Po Kong, Mong Kok, Cheung Sha Wan, Kwai Chung and Yuen Long. A total of eight sets of karaoke devices used for playing suspected infringing songs, one set of suspected infringing game console and a batch of audio and video equipment with a total estimated market value of about $240,000 were seized. Two male persons-in-charge of the party rooms, aged 27 and 42, were arrested on suspicion of contravening the Copyright Ordinance. Both arrested persons were released on bail pending the investigation. The investigation is ongoing and further arrests are not ruled out.

  During the investigation, Customs found six party rooms located in industrial buildings that were suspected of breaching the lease conditions, and the cases have been referred to the Lands Department for further follow-up action.

  Customs reminds business operators to comply with the Ordinance and to make enquiries to copyright owners on matters relating to the use of musical visual recordings in the course of business.

  With the Christmas and New Year holidays approaching, Customs will continue to step up inspection and enforcement to resolutely combat different kinds of infringing activities to safeguard the rights of copyright owners.

  Under the Ordinance, any person, who without the licence of the copyright owner of a copyright work, possesses infringing copies of a copyright work for the purpose of, or in the course of, any trade or business with a view to it being used by any person commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $50,000 per infringing copy and imprisonment for four years.

  Members of the public may report any suspected infringing activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

ââAt the meeting, the Hong Kong and Shenzhen sides reviewed the achievements of the development of Qianhai and explored future co-operation directions, discussing further promotion of Qianhai's high quality development together. Both sides exchanged views on issues such as deepening the integrated development of technology and finance, joint talent attraction, and the alignment of rules in the field of engineering construction.

ââMr Tsang said, ""The development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) is a key national strategy personally devised, personally planned and personally driven by President Xi Jinping, and Qianhai is one of the major co-operation platforms in the GBA. Since its development, Qianhai has always adhered to the strategic positioning and objectives of 'relying on Hong Kong, serving the Chinese Mainland and opening up to the world', striving to become an important engine for the development of the GBA and the Shenzhen pilot demonstration area. It shall fully leverage its role in demonstrating and leading high-level, high-quality opening-up within the region, while ensuring successful policy experiences radiate throughout the GBA and across the nation. With the staunch support of the Central Government and the joint efforts of Hong Kong and Shenzhen, the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Co-operation Zone has achieved fruitful results, including deepened alignment of rules and mechanisms among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, significant advancement of market integration, matured collaborative development model, closer youth exchanges, and its role as a new engine for GBA development has become increasingly bold and evident.""

  ""As stated by President Xi during the Chief Executive's reporting of work, the HKSAR Government shall proactively align with the '15th Five-Year' Plan, uphold and enhance the executive-led system, make solid progress in advancing high-quality economic development, deeply engage in the development of the GBA, and better integrate into and serve the overall national development. The HKSAR Government will continue to lead all sectors of the Hong Kong community proactively to fully seize the opportunities of developing the GBA together. With a pragmatic, innovative and change-embracing spirit, the HKSAR Government will ensure the effective implementation of various tasks and continue to strengthen the co-operation with Shenzhen to jointly promote the development of Qianhai. It will serve the country's needs with Hong Kong's strengths, and anchor the new strategic positioning and historic mission of the GBA given by President Xi to a greater breadth and depth.""

ââMr Wang responded, ""Relying on Hong Kong and serving Hong Kong is the inherent responsibility and mission of Qianhai. With the support and assistance of the HKSAR Government and all sectors of the Hong Kong community, we have implemented comprehensive and systematic measures. Tangible and practical measures have been introduced in areas such as the integration of rules and mechanisms, the interconnectivity of infrastructure, and the convergence of people's livelihoods. We have achieved new progress in developing the area in line with its positioning as a 'pioneering zone for deepening integration and development between Shenzhen and Hong Kong'. Moving forward, Qianhai will thoroughly study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, deepen the 'soft connectivity' of rules and mechanisms, the 'hard connectivity' of infrastructure, and the 'heartfelt connectivity' between Shenzhen and Hong Kong residents. This will foster closer co-operation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong and serve Hong Kong's high-quality development.""

ââAt the meeting, the Hong Kong and Shenzhen sides signed four co-operation arrangements, including:

A co-operation framework agreement signed by the Qianhai Authority and the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES)

Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-18 22:52,2025-12-18 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/18/P2025121800921.htm," âThe three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

 For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3.5 billion as of noon today (December 18). With the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.8 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

 The Government announced today that two new measuresare launched under the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po to render assistance to residents affected by the fire. They are to provide affected flat owners with an annual rental grant of $150,000 (to be provided for two years) and a one-off relocation grant of $50,000; as well as to provide affected tenants with a one-off relocation grant of $50,000.

 The Government earlier announced that a living allowance from the Support Fund will be provided to each affected household, and the amount has been increased from $50,000 to $100,000. As of today, 1 926 cases have been processed. In addition, the Government will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 143 cases have been processed. The allowance will be disbursed in phases.

 Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 980 affected households, providing the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service to more than 4 900 residents. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

 Currently, there is still an abundant supply of more than 1000 units that can provide affected residents with longer term accommodation. The transitional housing and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) projects in different districts can altogether provide around 400 units at the moment. Besides, Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun and Runway 1331 at Kai Tak can provide a supply of around 900 units.

 As of this morning, a total of 620 residents are staying in hotel rooms through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, and 552 residents are staying in youth hostels/camps. Another 3 457 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau, units from the HKHS, or Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun.

 In addition, to provide residents in need with more choices, Housing Bureau swiftly made ready the units at Po Tin Interim Housing, which has elevators, for occupancy. During the process, corporate volunteer teams arrived on-site to assist with the flooring installation, making the units habitable within a short period of time. Colleagues from various divisions of Housing Bureau and the Housing Department also dedicated their efforts, actively liaising with various donor organisations to furnish the units with essential daily supplies.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

 The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 900 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, over 28 000 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Investigation and regulation
-------------------------------------

 Relevant policy bureaux and departments continue to follow up on the fire investigation and regulatory efforts."
Rental Grant and Relocation Grant for Flat Owners and Relocation Grant for Tenants rolled out by the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po ,2025-12-18 22:28,2025-12-18 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/18/P2025121800891.htm,"The Government announced today (December 18) that two new measures rolled out by the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po will render assistance to residents affected by the fire.

The first measure is to provide affected flat owners with an annual rental grant of $150,000 and a one-off relocation grant of $50,000. The second measure is to provide affected tenants with a one-off relocation grant of $50,000. The details of the two measures are as follows –

(1) Rental grant and relocation grant for flat owners

The Support Fund will provide owners of each of the flats in Wang Fuk Court with an annual rental grant of $150,000 to give them more flexibility and choices in their accommodation arrangements. The grant will be provided for two years and disbursed on a semi-annual basis, with each payment being $75,000.

In tandem with the provision of the rental grant, the Support Fund will provide a one-off relocation grant of $50,000 to the relevant flat owners of Wang Fuk Court to subsidise the relocation and costs for replacing items such as furniture and appliances. Both grants are provided on a non-accountable basis.

Although Wang Chi House is less affected by the fire, it is still yet to be re-opened. The relevant flat owners also have accommodation needs and therefore the two grants are also applicable to owners of Wang Chi House.

The first installment of rental grant of $75,000 and the relocation grant of $50,000 will be disbursed starting from December 22 through the ""one social worker per household"" mechanism. The Social Welfare Department will handle the cases in accordance with the relevant land registration records and flat owners are not required to submit ownership documents.

(2) Relocation grant for tenants

Although Wang Fuk Court is not long-term or permanent accommodation for the tenants, the Support Fund will provide a one-off relocation grant of $50,000 to the original tenants of Wang Fuk Court on a discretionary basis. This will facilitate them to move from the accommodation arranged by the Government to the flats in the private market.

All original tenants of Wang Fuk Court who choose not to stay in the emergency accommodation arranged by the Government (including youth hostel/campsites/hotel rooms), the Housing Bureau's transitional housing or the Housing Society's flats can receive relocation grant when they move out from the abovementioned flats/units to the flats arranged by themselves through the private market. The relocation grant will also be provided on a non-accountable basis and through the ""one social worker per household"" mechanism.

In addition, for tenants who have moved into the Housing Bureau's transitional housing or the flats of the Hong Kong Housing Society, or tenants who wish to temporarily move to those flats, they will receive a rent-free period till May 31, 2026. If the tenants choose to stay in these flats of the Housing Bureau or the Hong Kong Housing Society beyond May 31, 2026, they will not receive the $50,000 relocation grant even though they eventually rent their own flats in the private market afterwards."
CSD responds to media enquiries about so-called research on latest situations about persons in custody in Hong Kong published by anti-China organization Amnesty International,2025-12-18 22:12,2025-12-18 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/18/P2025121800881.htm,"In response to media enquiries about the publication by Amnesty International, an anti-China organization, of its so-called research on the situations about persons in custody (PICs) in Hong Kong earlier, a spokesperson for the Correctional Services Department (CSD) today (December 18) strongly condemned the content of the so-called research, which is fact-twisting as well as baseless. The research is intended to smear the legitimate custodial management carried out by the CSD in accordance with the law by citingdifferent lies told by anti-China fugitives, who had breached supervision order and who had absconded from Hong Kong to engage in acts and activities endangering national security.

The spokesperson also criticized this anti-China organization for not including in full the written response from the CSD earlier in its so-called research, with a view to presenting a distorted picture with ill intentions.

Amnesty International is an anti-China organization under the guise of an organization purportedly safeguarding human rights. In the past, Amnesty International smeared the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) through fabrication by falsely claiming that a Uyghur student had gone missing in Hong Kong and attributing the incident to the HKSAR Government. In fact, the person concerned had never entered Hong Kong nor been denied entry into Hong Kong. This shows that it is the usual and despicable tactic of this anti-China organization to disseminate false information to smear the HKSAR Government. We must refute its false accusations one by one in order to set the record straight.

Contrary to the claims made by Amnesty International, the CSD is committed to ensuring a secure, safe, humane, decent and healthy custodial environment and providing appropriate rehabilitation programmes to PICs to help them turn a new leaf with dignity. Its allegations of conditions prevalent within correctional institutions, such as physical violence, extremely high temperatures and poor ventilation inside the institutions in summer, solitary confinement and unsanitary conditions, are wholly unfounded.

Zero tolerance of physical abuse

The CSD places utmost importance on discipline and professionalism across all correctional facilities. As provided by the Prison Rules (Cap. 234A), any officer of CSD who, without necessity, uses force in dealing with prisoners or uses undue force, violates discipline and may also be criminally liable in such circumstances. The CSD adheres strictly to statutory requirements on enforcement actions, and to the principles of impartiality and professionalism.

Extensive measures to cope with hot weather conditions

The CSD has taken extensive measures to continuously improve the custodial environment and to ensure the well-being of PICs. These include the installation of anti-suicide safety fans and industrial fans, the progressive replacement of ventilation systems, and the installation of new gates and windows with improved ventilation efficiency. The CSD has also taken further steps, including conducting trials of heat-insulating coatings on buildings and providing hand fans and cooling towels to PICs, which demonstrate our proactive approach to address hot weather conditions.

Removal from association having regard to PICs' interests and according to law

The CSD is devoted to ensuring that all arrangements for removal from association or separate confinement of PICs are appropriate in the circumstances of the case and in strict adherence to the law, and in line with the prevailing practices in other jurisdictions. Rule 68B of the Prison Rules empowers the CSD to remove a PIC from association with other PICs for purposes such as safeguarding the interests or personal safety of the PICs. Where the removal from association is initiated at the request of a PIC, the PIC concerned may request to resume association at any time.

Constant attention to sanitation and hygienic condition

The CSD has all along enforced the highest possible degree of cleanliness in the correctional institutions in accordance with the law. Daily inspection are conducted to ensure cleanliness of the correctional institutions and frequent examinations are conducted by the institutional medical officers for purposes of cleanliness and sanitation. Besides, the management of correctional institutions regularly arranges for comprehensive cleaning and disinfection of the institutions, and arranges outside contractors to carry out pest control and rodent eradication work to ensure that the environmental conditions in the institutions are clean and hygienic.

The CSD has put in place mechanisms, including regular visits from Justices of the Peace, who inspect the prisons to ensure the rights of PICs are protected. PICs who feel aggrieved by any treatment they received could lodge a complaint through various channels within and outside the CSD e.g. the Ombudsman.

The CSD once again strongly condemns Amnesty International for spreading false and biased accusations and deliberately discrediting the CSD in properly carrying out its duties in the management of correctional institutions.

The CSD will, as always, continue to resolutely and fearlessly discharge its duties in strict accordance with the laws, ensuring the security of correctional institutions while safeguarding the rights, dignity and well-being of all PICs."

第一項是向受影響的業主發放每年15萬元的租金補助和一次性五萬元的搬遷補助。第二項是向受影響的租戶發放一次性五萬元的搬遷補助。兩項措施的詳情如下：

（一）業主租金補助及搬遷補助

援助基金將向每個宏福苑單位的業主發放每年15萬元的租金補助，讓他們在安排住宿上更具彈性及有更多選擇。補助為期兩年，每半年發放一次，即每次發放七萬五千元。

在提供租金補助的同時，援助基金亦會為相關宏福苑業主提供一次性五萬元的搬遷補助，資助他們搬遷及重置傢俬和電器等的費用。兩項補助都是非實報實銷的。

雖然宏志閣受火災影響較少，但宏志閣現時仍然有待解封，相關業主亦有居住需要，因此兩項補助亦適用於宏志閣的業主。

首筆七萬五千元的租金補助及一次性的五萬元搬遷補助將在十二月二十二日起陸續透過「一戶一社工」的機制發放。社會福利署將根據相關的土地註冊紀錄處理，業主無需提交業權文件。

（二）租戶搬遷補助

雖然宏福苑的租戶並非以宏福苑單位作為長期或永久居所，但援助基金亦酌情向宏福苑原租戶提供一次性五萬元的搬遷補助，協助他們離開政府安排的住宿，並搬遷至私人市場的單位。

所有選擇不居住於政府提供的應急住宿（包括青年宿舍／營舍或酒店房間）或房屋局的過渡性房屋或香港房屋協會的單位的宏福苑原租戶，皆可在他們搬離上述的住宿／單位至自行在私人市場租住的單位時，獲發搬遷補助。搬遷補助同樣是非實報實銷並經「一戶一社工」的機制發放。

此外，已入住房屋局的過渡性房屋或香港房屋協會單位的租戶，或希望暫時搬遷到這些單位的租戶，可獲免租金直至二○二六年五月三十一日。租戶如選擇居住於房屋局或房協的單位超過二○二六年五月三十一日，即使之後自行在私人市場租住單位，亦不會獲發五萬元搬遷補助。"

在會議上，港深雙方共同回顧前海發展的工作成果和展望未來的合作方向，共商進一步推動前海高質量發展。雙方就深化科技與金融深度融合發展、聯合招才引智、工程建設領域規則銜接等議題進行交流。

曾國衞表示︰「粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）建設是國家主席習近平親自謀劃、親自部署、親自推動的國家重大戰略，而前海是大灣區的重大合作平台之一，自開發建設以來，一直堅持以『依托香港、服務內地、面向世界』的目標定位，致力成為大灣區、深圳先行示範區建設的重要引擎，要充分發揮在大灣區高水平、高品質對外開放示範引領作用，並讓成功的政策經驗輻射至整個大灣區以至全國。在中央大力支持和港深共同努力下，前海深港現代服務業合作區取得了豐碩的成果，包括粵港澳規則銜接、機制對接不斷深化，市場一體化進程顯著推進，協同協調發展模式更加完善，青少年交往交流更為緊密，對大灣區發展的新引擎作用也是日益彰顯。」

「習主席在日前聽取行政長官述職報告時表示，特區政府要主動對接國家『十五五』規劃，堅持和完善行政主導，扎實推動經濟高質量發展，深度參與大灣區建設，更好融入和服務國家發展大局。特區政府定當繼續主動積極帶領香港社會各界，全力抓住共建大灣區的機遇，以務實擔當、創新求變的精神，把各項工作做好做實，同時不斷加強與深方合作，共同把前海建設做好，充分發揮香港所長，貢獻國家所需，錨定並縱深推進習主席賦予大灣區『一點兩地』的新戰略定位和歷史使命。」

王守睿回應指︰「『依託香港、服務香港』，是前海與生俱來的責任和使命。在香港特區政府和社會各界的支持幫助下，全面發力、系統施策，在規則機制一體化銜接、基礎設施一體化聯通、民生領域一體化融通等領域，拿出一批可見可感可及的務實舉措，圍繞『深港深度融合發展引領區』這一定位發展取得了一些新進展。接下來，前海將深入學習貫徹黨的二十屆四中全會精神，深入推進規則機制『軟聯通』、基礎設施『硬聯通』、深港居民『心聯通』，促進深港緊密合作、服務香港高質量發展。」

HKSAR Government strongly objects to slanders and smears by G7 foreign ministers and High Representative of EU regarding Lai Chee-ying case,2025-12-18 20:22,2025-12-18 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/18/P2025121800705.htm,"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (December 18) strongly disapproves and objects to the slanders and smears by the foreign ministers of the G7, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US), as well as the High Representative of the European Union, after the court of the HKSAR found Lai Chee-ying guilty of offences of endangering national security in strict accordance with the law and evidence.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""Safeguarding national security is a top priority of every country. In accordance with international law and international relations based on the Charter of the United Nations, it is each and every sovereign state's inherent right to enact laws safeguarding national security, and it is also an international practice. Acts and activities endangering national security could bring very serious consequences. Prompt actions must be taken to prevent and suppress such acts and activities effectively. No country will watch with folded arms and tolerate any of such acts and activities endangering national security without taking any action. The relevant countries have also enacted legislation to combat collusion with foreign forces, including the National Security Act 2023 by the UK, Foreign Agents Registration Act by the US, and the Countering Foreign Interference Act by Canada. In recent years, they have even intensified their crackdown, frequently labeling and charging individuals and organisations with legitimate dealings with China as 'undertaking espionage activities' yet charges are often dropped later on, or the defendants are found not guilty, due to insufficient evidence. It is ironic that these countries now try to whitewash Lai Chee-ying's blatant collusion with foreign or external forces, and his begging for sanctions against China as well as the Hong Kong SAR, as 'exercising freedom of speech and the press'. This clearly exposes the double standard of these countries. They showed no respect for the fact that charges had been laid against Lai Chee-ying and other defendants by the Department of Justice entirely based on evidence and public interest. There was no respect for the court of the HKSAR which had exercised judicial power independently and strictly on the basis of facts and evidence. They also refused to acknowledge the evidence set out in the reasons for verdict, and refused to understand the court's considerations and rationale for the verdict. Instead, they wantonly vilified the HKSAR prosecutorial and judicial authorities' discharge of their duties in accordance with the law as 'undermining rights and freedoms', and continued to unscrupulously distort the facts to criticise the HKSAR. What these countries have done in this case is a true reflection of their bullying behaviour all along, which is extremely ugly and despicable.""

Court's conviction verdict was entirely free from any political considerations

The spokesperson reiterated, ""The court clearly pointed out in the reasons for verdict that Lai Chee-ying was not on trial for his political views or beliefs. The court's reasons for verdict in this case are 855 pages long, which are fully open for public inspection, and include the court's analysis of the relevant legal principles and evidence, as well as the reasons for convicting Lai Chee-ying and the three defendant companies in full detail.""

The spokesperson stressed, ""Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law and has always adhered to the principle that laws must be obeyed and lawbreakers be held accountable. Article 5 of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and section 2 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security. Any suggestion that certain individuals or organisations should be immune from legal consequences for their illegal acts is no different from advocating a special privilege to break the law, and this totally runs contrary to the spirit of the rule of law.”

The Lai Chee-ying case has nothing to do with freedom of the press at all

The spokesperson said, ""Some countries have conflated the criminal acts in this case with freedom of the press, and have even played up different cases to vilify the HKSAR, with the purpose of misleading the public and defaming the HKSAR's human rights and rule of law. In fact, the case Lai Chee-ying has nothing to do with freedom of the press at all. Over the years, the defendants have used journalism as a guise to commit acts that brought harm to our country and Hong Kong. The public trial of this case has revealed Lai Chee-ying's close management and hands-on control of the editorial direction of Apple Daily, and one of the senior managers even said they were free within a 'bird cage'. Meanwhile, Lai Chee-ying had repeatedly and personally colluded with foreign forces, begging for sanctions and hostile actions against the Central Authorities and the HKSAR Government.

""Hong Kong citizens enjoy freedom of the press and freedom of speech as protected under the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. In fact, the HKNSL and the SNSOclearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security. The rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of the press, of speech and of publication, enjoyed by Hong Kong people under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to the HKSAR, are protected in accordance with the law. Like all other places in the world, journalists, just like all other citizens, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. According to the principles established by Article 19 of the ICCPR, the European Convention on Human Rights and relevant jurisprudence, when the media and journalists publish opinions, information and articles, they must observe and discharge 'special duties and responsibilities', including protection of national security and public order; journalists must, in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism', act in good faith on accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information, so as to be entitled to the protection of freedom of speech and press freedom.""

The spokesman reiterated, ""The human rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents are firmly protected by the Constitution and the Basic Law. Any foreign or external forces attempting to discredit Hong Kong through the conviction verdict in Lai Chee-ying's case will only expose their own weakness and faulty arguments and will never succeed. The HKSAR Government strongly demands that the relevant countries immediately cease actions that violate international law and the fundamental principles of international relations, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, which are purely China's internal matters. The HKSAR Government will continue to steadfastly perform its duties and safeguard national security."""

政務司副司長聯同民政及青年事務局局長和勞工及福利局局長就大埔宏福苑援助基金會見傳媒談話內容（附圖／短片）,2025-12-18 19:45,2025-12-18 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/18/P2025121800692.htm,"政務司副司長卓永興、民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十二月十八日）下午就大埔宏福苑援助基金會見傳媒。以下是他們的談話內容：

政務司副司長：各位記者朋友，今日我們有兩項支援宏福苑受火災影響居民的措施向大家宣布。第一項是向受影響的業主發放每年15萬元的租金補助和一次性五萬元的搬遷補助。第二項是向受影響的租戶發放一次性五萬元的搬遷補助。

大埔宏福苑火災在十一月二十六日發生後，數千名居民頓時失去居所，政府即時為受災居民安排應急住宿。現時，共有632名居民仍居於民政及青年事務局協調的酒店房間、548名市民仍居於青年宿舍或營舍；另有3 439名居民居於房屋局的過渡性房屋、香港房屋協會（房協）項目或屯門寶田中轉房屋的單位。

在數目上，政府是有一千多個能用於較長期安置受影響居民的單位，包括約400個位於不同區域的過渡性房屋和房協項目單位，以及約900個位於屯門的寶田中轉房屋及位於啟德的「啟航1331」單位。然而，我們從「一戶一社工」接觸居民及地區反饋得知，很多居民希望有一個選項，就是能得到租金津貼，讓他們在租務市場租住切合他們，譬如希望原區居住，以及方便他們出行、返工、返學、就醫等日常的單位。

居民的要求不難理解亦非常合理。鑑於政府在大埔區已沒有剩餘的應急住宿，我們認為提供租金補助讓居民可以自行選擇適合自己家庭狀況的較長時間居停，是最能解決問題及最可行的。因此，政府會由十二月二十二日，即下星期一開始，向所有宏福苑業主發放每年15萬元的租金補助和一次性五萬元的搬遷補助。有關的詳情，民青局局長稍後會向大家講解。

至於宏福苑的租戶，由於他們並非以宏福苑單位作為永久居停，因此他們會較有彈性作出新的居住安排。但政府也理解他們在不同程度上受到火災影響。所以，我們亦會向宏福苑原租戶提供一次性五萬元的搬遷補助，方便他們搬遷至私人市場新的租住單位。有關的詳情，民政及青年事務局局長亦會向大家講解。

現在請民政及青年事務局局長。

民政及青年事務局局長︰正如剛才政務司副司長所說，我們會推出數項補助。首先是業主租金補助和業主搬遷補助。每個宏福苑單位的業主每年可以獲發15萬元的租金補助，補助為期兩年，而每半年發放一次，即每次發放七萬五千元，補助以單位為基礎，如果單位有超過一名業主，每年的租金補助也是15萬元。在提供租金補助的同時，我們也會為相關宏福苑業主提供一次性五萬元搬遷補助，資助他們搬遷和重置傢俬和電器等費用。如果有關業主是搬離我們現時提供的應急住所，即是酒店或青年宿舍，他們可以獲得這五萬元的搬遷補助。舉例，如果他現時住在酒店，稍後搬到過渡屋，或直接在私人市場租地方住，皆可得到這五萬元的搬遷補助。而已搬到過渡屋的住戶，同樣可獲得這五萬元的搬遷補助。

首筆租金補助，即七萬五千元和一次性的搬遷補助五萬元，將會在十二月二十日（應為二十二日）起，陸續透過「一戶一社工」機制發放。當然，正如我剛才所說，如果仍然住在酒店的業主，他們要搬離應急住宿後，才會獲得一次性五萬元的搬遷補助。而社會福利署將會根據相關的土地註冊紀錄處理，業主不需要另外提交業權文件。

這個補助是為所有宏福苑業主，雖然宏志閣受火災影響較少，但是宏志閣現時仍有待解封，所以相關業主仍然有居住需要，故租金補助同樣適用於宏志閣業主。而為了向業主提供更大彈性，業主領取了租金補助後，他們仍然可以選擇住在房屋局提供的過渡性房屋或房協單位，但因為他們已經領取了租金補助，他們需要向過渡屋的營運機構或房協繳交相應租金。正如剛才所說，現時住在酒店或青年宿舍的業主，他們搬出時，可以得到五萬元的搬遷補助，但如果他們想繼續居住在有關酒店或青年宿舍，他們也要因應營運者的房間供應及需要繳交相應租金。

另外一項是針對現時的租戶。原本在宏福苑的租戶，我們會向所有選擇自行在私人市場租住單位的租戶發放一次性五萬元的搬遷補助。補助是以單位為基礎，若單位有超過一名租戶，搬遷補助也是五萬元。

特區政府在火災後已透過華人慈善基金，向這些租戶每戶派發一萬元應急錢；我們亦已透過大埔宏福苑援助基金，向這些租戶每戶派發10萬元生活津貼，以協助他們解決應急需要。五萬元的搬遷補助加上之前提供的緊急支援，應可讓他們在原有的基礎上照顧未來的需要，亦可找到地方租住。

搬遷補助經社會福利署「一戶一社工」機制發放。現時居於酒店或青年宿舍的租戶若希望繼續居住，他們需因應營運者的房間供應及需要繳交租金。已入住房屋局的過渡性房屋或房協單位的租戶，或希望暫時搬遷到這些單位，可以免租金直至二○二六年五月三十一日。租戶如選擇居住於房屋局或房協的單位超過二○二六年五月三十一日，即使之後在私人市場租住單位，亦不會獲發五萬元搬遷補助。五月三十一日後，他們也需要向過渡屋的營運機構或房協繳交租金。

另外，我們留意到有聲音指，大埔宏福苑援助基金在處理了受影響居民的緊急經濟需要後，未來應更集中支援自住業主的長遠需要。因此，在可見的將來，是次針對宏福苑租戶的補助應該是基金轄下最後一個以租戶為對象的現金援助。基金未來將集中用於長期支援業主。但租戶因受火災影響而產生社會福利或醫療需要，仍可以按相關部門現有機制獲得支援。換言之，如果是業主，可以得到一個每年15萬元的租金補助，分兩次，即是每半年發放七萬五千元。如果他們由酒店搬到私人市場單位或過渡屋，可以得到五萬元的搬遷補助。而租戶，如果他們現時住在酒店，他們搬離酒店，無論是搬到過渡屋或搬到私人市場單位，都可以得到這五萬元的搬遷補助，而租戶如果是想繼續住在過渡屋，在二○二六年五月三十一日後需向有關的營運機構繳交相應租金。我簡單介紹到此。

記者：如果租戶在二○二六年五月三十一日之後便沒有補助和要繳交租金，與現在只相隔半年，會否太趕急呢？如租戶在租屋方面有困難，政府有沒有酌情安排可以幫助他們？給業主補助的兩年期限定位是甚麼？如有業主很有困難，在兩年之後都找不到地方住，政府會否有通融的安排呢？

民政及青年事務局局長：關於租戶，正如我們剛才強調，我們知道很多宏福苑業主認為援助基金需要日後長期支援有關業主，因為他們日後的安置安排或居住安排都需要長期的支援。至於租戶，我們早前已提供應急幫助，如他們住在過渡性房屋，可以居住多半年，直至明年五月三十一日。我們相信宏福苑不是租戶的永久居所，他們比較有彈性能夠利用半年時間另外找到住屋需要。如果一些租戶有社會福利或醫療需要，我們會繼續在社會福利和醫療角度支援這些租戶，這些一定是不會少的。但是，如果利用這個援助基金去幫助租戶，我們希望今次這個搬遷補助可以幫助他們，亦希望日後善用這個援助基金。

至於你剛才問為甚麼是兩年呢？簡單來說，如果在私人市場租單位，一個租約大約是兩年，我們期望在兩年內可以就着宏福苑的長期安排有一個定案，令業主能夠盡快做決定。如果我們在兩年內已經有一些長期的重置安排，而業主亦接受安排，他們便不再需要租金補助。我們希望援助金能夠在現時情況下，正如剛才副司長說，我們知道很多業主很想留在大埔原區，或找一些他們合適的居所，提供租金津貼可以為他們提供彈性。我們在考慮這些計劃時，最重要是確保援助基金能夠用得其所，能夠長期支援業主的長期需要，包括他們日後長期的居住安排、安置安排。我希望大家能夠明白，我們提出這個租金補助的計劃是希望能夠提供彈性。在提供彈性之餘，我們需要確保基金用得其所，幫助宏福苑業主長期需要的支援項目方面。

記者：你好，想問五萬元給租戶是否真的足夠？因為現時私人市場樓價都不便宜。五萬元與可能每一年業主得到15萬元其實都有一個差別，雖然他不是那間屋的業主，但其實五萬元是否真的足夠？而業主15萬元，還有沒有其他補償方案？15萬元又是否真的足夠？因為可能一個四人家庭，其實未必夠他們找居所。

政務司副司長：或者我回答你這個問題，你剛才提到五萬元，說的是租戶，其實五萬元說清楚是搬遷補助，不是租屋、租住的補助。為何我們有這樣的安排呢？正如我們剛才所說，租戶不是以宏福苑單位作永久或很長期的居所，租了一間屋，而那間屋不幸被大火燒毀，其實一個租客正常做的是找另一間屋去租。剛才亦有記者朋友問及，到五月三十一日，時間是否足夠，其實如果由現在開始計，有足五個半月時間去租另一個地方，所以我們覺得這是合理的。至於你提到15萬元又是否足夠，其實我們都有參考過大火前宏福苑的租金，如果將15萬元除以十二個月，大概一個月有12,500元，跟宏福苑在大火前的租金相若，所以我們覺得這是一個合理的安排。

記者：但其實基金有38億元，今次補助會否太少？

政務司副司長：基金方面現時我們共有38億元，計及剛才所說的補助（再加上早前公布的八個項目） 總承擔額約12億元。每一項支援措施，其實是看其合理性，並不是基金有很多錢，不如不是15萬元，給20萬元、30萬元又如何？我想這需要平衡，同時亦不要忘記，宏福苑會有一個重置的方案，尚未知道方案會如何，是否需要用到基金配合，所以一定要用得其所，審慎地運用市民和機構捐給我們的捐款。多謝。

懲教署回應傳媒查詢反華組織國際特赦組織發布所謂香港在囚人士最新情況的研究,2025-12-18 19:45,2025-12-18 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/18/P2025121800729.htm,"回應傳媒查詢反華組織國際特赦組織日前發布所謂有關香港在囚人士情況的研究，懲教署發言人今日（十二月十八日）強烈譴責該所謂報告內容不盡不實，毫無事實根據，並引用違反監管令、潛逃境外並危害國家安全的反華分子的謊言穿鑿附會，以污衊抹黑懲教署的依法正當的羈管工作。

發言人批評該反華組織未有在其所謂最新研究報告中，全面刊登懲教署早前給其的書面回覆，以求以偏概全，居心叵測。

國際特赦組織是以「捍衞人權」作幌子的反華組織，過往曾捏造事實污衊抹黑香港特區政府，訛稱一名維吾爾族學生在香港失蹤，並指控事件與香港特區政府有關，事實上，有關人士從來沒有入境，也沒有被拒入境。由此可知發布假消息詆毀香港特區政府是該反華組織的慣用伎倆，手法卑劣，令人不齒。我們必須逐點駁斥它的失實指控，以正視聽。

與該反華組織的指控相反，懲教署致力確保羈管環境穩妥、安全、人道、合適及健康，並為在囚人士提供適切的更生計劃，協助他們具尊嚴地改過自新。其不實指控懲教署懲教院所普遍存在的情況，例如肢體暴力、夏季室溫極高且通風不良、單獨囚禁及環境衞生惡劣，均毫無根據。

對肢體虐待零容忍

懲教署高度重視所有懲教設施的紀律和人員的專業操守。根據《監獄規則》(第234A章)規定，任何懲教署人員在處理囚犯時無需要而使用武力，或使用不當武力，均屬違紀，更可能須負上刑責。懲教署一直嚴格遵守執法方面的法定要求，以及恪守公正與專業的原則。

應對酷熱天氣的廣泛措施

懲教署已採取廣泛措施，持續改善羈管環境及確保在囚人士的福祉。有關措施包括安裝防自殺安全風扇及工業風扇、陸續更換通風系統，以及安裝通風效能更佳的新閘門及窗戶。懲教署亦已採取進一步措施，包括在建築物上試用隔熱塗層，並向在囚人士提供手搖扇及降溫毛巾，可見懲教署積極採取不同措施應對酷熱天氣。

顧及在囚人士的利益依法中止與其他在囚人士交往

懲教署致力確保所有中止在囚人士與其他在囚人士交往或隔離囚禁的安排，均就有關個案情況而言屬合適，並且嚴格遵從法律，以及與其他司法管轄區的現行做法一致。《監獄規則》第68B條賦權懲教署可為保障在囚人士的利益或人身安全等目的，中止在囚人士與其他在囚人士交往。如中止與其他在囚人士交往的安排是應在囚人士的要求作出，有關在囚人士可隨時要求恢復與其他在囚人士交往。

持續關注環境衞生

懲教署一直依法在懲教院所內執行最高程度的清潔標準，人員每日巡查以確保懲教院所清潔，院所醫生亦經常檢查清潔及衞生狀況。此外，署方會定期安排全面清潔及消毒院所，並安排外間承辦商進行防治蟲鼠工作，以確保院所環境清潔衞生。

懲教署一直設有一系列機制，例如透過太平紳士定期巡視的安排，確保在囚人士的權利獲得保障。如在囚人士有所不滿，可透過署內或者署外不同途徑（例如申訴專員）作出申訴。

懲教署再次強烈譴責國際特赦組織散播虛假指控，蓄意抹黑署方妥善履行懲教院所管理的職責。

懲教署將一如既往，繼續堅定不移、無畏無懼地嚴格依法履行職責，在確保懲教院所安全的同時，亦致力保障所有在囚人士的權利、尊嚴及福祉。

Remarks by DCS at media session (with photo/video),2025-12-18 19:45,2025-12-18 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/18/P2025121800683.htm,"  The Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing; the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak; and the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, met the media this afternoon (December 18) on the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. Following are the remarks at the question-and-answer session:

Reporter: Why did the Government decide to hand out more money to affected homeowners and tenants? Secondly, how likely is the annual rent subsidy for $150,000 to be extended after two years?

Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration: As we have explained in the opening remarks, while the Government has been trying to provide some emergency accommodation for the affected victims, including both landlords and tenants, we have (learned), through the feedback of our social workers assigned to look after individual households and also through district feedback, that many residents actually wanted to have another option of a rental subsidy to be given to them, so that they can, from the private market, rent suitable accommodation, which can fit into their daily routines, such as going to work, going to school, and going to see doctors. Also, because many residents have lived in Tai Po for a long time, they have their social network there. If they stay in the transitional housing elsewhere in Hong Kong, they have this problem of social dislocation. So we decided that - and also we have surveyed the stock of our public housing accommodation in Tai Po - actually we don't have any more such units left. So we think a sensible, practicable and effective solution is really to offer them this rental subsidy, which we think is not an excessive demand; it is reasonable.

  Your second question is whether the rental subsidy will end after two years. I think Secretary Mak has already said that we think a normal tenancy lasts for about two years. We believe, within these two years, the final solution, or solutions, for the long-term housing and accommodation needs of the victims will already be offered and introduced. Of course, when the final offers have come out, we have to ascertain the response of the residents. We have two years to consider whether, if necessary, this rental subsidy may continue, but the overarching principle is that we can assure the victims that our solutions will be reasonable and no one will be left homeless - I mean, for the landlords - because of the lack of support from the Government.

(Please also refer to the Chinese portion of the remarks.)"

  The Hospital Authority (HA) conducted another community outreach session today (December 18) ahead of the Public Healthcare Fees and Charges Reform implementation on January 1 next year. HA representatives explained the implementation details to over 200 District Council members and their assistants, aiming to reach more citizens through the extensive community network of District Councils and make the reform arrangements clear to more citizens.

  The briefing on Public Healthcare Fees and Charges Reform was held at the Mong Kok Community Hall. The Chief Executive of the HA, Dr Libby Lee, said in her opening remarks, ""The HA has been maintaining close communication with various sectors of the community to ensure citizens fully understand the reform arrangements. We understand that members of the public need time to comprehend and adapt to the new arrangements. Therefore, the HA has been strengthening community-level communication. This briefing session allows District Council representatives to further understand the reform details and clarify concerns, including details of the fees and charges, and enhanced measures to protect patients. We hope that District Council members, as an important bridge to the community, can help convey this information to help citizens understand the protection offered by the new measures.""

  Different HA representatives provided detailed explanations of the new fees and charges arrangements and important points for patients to note after implementation. These included patient journey matters for specialist outpatient clinics and family medicine clinics, non-emergency radiology services, pathology laboratory services, enhanced medical fee waiver mechanisms, the introduction of an annual spending cap of $10,000 for public healthcare fees and charges, and expanded safety nets. The briefing session was engaging, with questions from attendees and HA responses helping to enhance public understanding of the new arrangements. The HA hopes these exchanges will help address concerns about implementation details and assist citizens in utilising various support measures.

  Since the announcement of the Public Healthcare Fees and Charges Reform in March this year, the HA has continuously explained the details through various channels, including media briefings, district briefing sessions, patient exchange meetings, focus groups, and hospital workshops. These activities aim to gather public and patient feedback and strengthen understanding of the new fees and charges items and implementation arrangements, hoping for smoother implementation next year. The HA has also produced various educational materials, including promotional videos and information booklets, to help citizens understand the new healthcare protection measures.

  The public healthcare fees and charges reform aims to enhance protection for poor, acute, serious, critical patients; rationalise public hospital service subsidies; reduce waste and abuse; and improve the sustainability of the public healthcare system."

During the operation, the FEHD arrested one person and initiated procedures on prosecution for the suspected operation of an unlicensed cold store. Over 10 tonnes of chilled poultry and frozen pork were found on the premises, about 272 kilograms of chilled poultry among them were rendered unfit for human consumption due to improper storage, and was seized for disposal.

Under the Food Business Regulation, the maximum penalty for operating an unlicensed cold store is a fine of $50,000 and six months' imprisonment upon conviction.

  The FEHD has proactively leveraged innovation and technology to boost the efficacy of environmental hygiene work. The officers of the FEHD made use of drones to facilitate collection of intelligence in the course of the investigation for the present operation, and this substantially stepped up the geographical coverage of the investigation and enhanced the efficacy of surveillance.

""We will continue our stringent enforcement actions against unlicensed food businesses to safeguard food safety and public health,"" a spokesman for the FEHD said.

Hospital Authority welcomes announcement of Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint,2025-12-18 18:53,2025-12-18 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/18/P2025121800659.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The Hospital Authority (HA) welcomes the Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint announced by the Health Bureau today (December 18). The HA will dovetail with the Government's policy direction to promote the development of Chinese medicine (CM), and work together to build Hong Kong as a bridgehead for CM to go global.

The HA reckons that CM is an integral part of Chinese culture, and Hong Kong possesses unique advantages in CM development. The blueprint sets out a comprehensive roadmap for the future development of CM in Hong Kong, which will further enhance the role and contribution of CM in Hong Kong's healthcare system.

Over the past two decades, the HA has been actively supporting the Government's initiatives to promote CM development, which include the establishment and management of Chinese Medicine Clinics cum Training and Research Centres (CMCTRs) at the 18 districts and launching government-subsidised CM outpatient services. The HA has also implemented various training and research programmes, such as the Chinese Medicine Practitioner (CMP) Trainee Programme, aiming to enhance the clinical competency of local young CMPs. In addition, the HA has actively developed integrated Chinese-Western medicine programmes, covering 26 public hospitals with a total of 67 designated hospital sites in recent years.

Looking ahead, the HA will continue to collaborate with the 18 CMCTRs to provide quality healthcare services, strengthening Hong Kong's integrated CM service network and bringing its benefits to more citizens."
Government implements Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles steadily and provides convenience upon entry into urban area under vehicle and road safety (with photo/video),2025-12-18 18:25,2025-12-18 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/18/P2025121800523.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (December 18) said that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been pressing ahead with the Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles (STGV) in a steady manner under the strategies of ensuring safety, effective diversion, well-equipped supporting facilities, and streamlined application processes. Various measures are ready to receive Guangdong vehicles entering Hong Kong's urban areas from December 23.

Positive response in applications

  The STGV (Entry into Urban Area) has been open for application from eligible Guangdong private cars since December 9. After the TD's vetting, applicants gradually completed procedures such as vehicle inspection, verification of e-contact means and obtaining insurance, and then submitted documents via the application system. The TD will issue electronic permits and approval letters to the successful applicants accordingly. The TD has arranged vehicle inspection centres to install the HKeToll vehicle tags for vehicles during inspection, and applicants are required to set up auto-payment means or top up their HKeToll accounts for toll payments. Starting from 0.00am on December 23, approved Guangdong vehicles with confirmed travel bookings may enter Hong Kong's urban areas via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) for up to three days per visit.

Vehicle and road safety

  The Government attaches great importance to vehicle and road safety. All Guangdong vehicles entering Hong Kong's urban areas are required to undergo and pass a vehicle examination in accordance with Hong Kong requirements at the TD's designated vehicle inspection centres on the Mainland. According to the TD's guidelines, inspection centres are required to carry out 15 inspection items, which include verification of the vehicle identification number and engine number; inspection of tyres and steering, suspension and braking systems; and examination of body structure, markings, safety equipment and whether any vehicle modifications have been made. Managed by Hong Kong service providers, the inspection centres must ensure that Guangdong vehicles are in compliance with Hong Kong standards and are safe for use on Hong Kong roads. The TD has provided training to inspection personnel to ensure consistency in inspection standards.

  On road safety, Hong Kong adopts the ""left-hand traffic"" rule for road design, under which traffic keeps to the left-hand side of the roads, which is different from that on the Mainland. The style of some traffic signs and road markings is also different. Guangdong drivers must heighten their vigilance, particularly when overtaking, making right turns at junctions, using roundabouts, merging onto expressways or seeing signs like ""Pedestrian crossing ahead"", ""Give way"" or ""Stop"", where extra caution is warranted. Motorists are reminded that failing to comply with relevant requirements under traffic laws is liable on conviction to fines or imprisonment.

  The TD has released videos on driving in Hong Kong at inspection centres and on social media to introduce Hong Kong's traffic rules, traffic signs and road markings, and points to note while driving. Publicity leaflets have also been distributed to remind Guangdong drivers of the differences between Mainland and Hong Kong road designs, traffic rules and facilities. Guangdong drivers may also refer to the Road Users' Code published by the TD for more details.

Enhanced supporting facilities for diversion

  After entering the urban areas, Guangdong drivers may download the TD's HKeMobility mobile app for the latest traffic news and details of parking and charging facilities in various districts to plan their journeys. The HKeMobility launched the STGV dedicated page (sbt.hkemobility.gov.hk) with new functions today to display, via a map-based interface, carparks with enhanced facilities supporting charging for Mainland electric vehicles and Mainland payment means. It also facilitates searches for carparks near tourist hotspots. The TD has liaised with operators of common navigation apps used by Mainland drivers and noted that they will update their Hong Kong maps with reference to HKeMobility and the transport and traffic data from the Government's Open Data Portal to provide the latest information on parking and charging facilities. These measures help ensure road safety and effective diversion.

  The TD will release information on carparks to provide convenience for Guangdong drivers in locating public and private carparks with enhanced supporting facilities across districts. Guangdong drivers may use the Octopus App or physical Octopus cards for payment at most carparks. Furthermore, the TD has commissioned an operator to set up the Lantau Charging Stationcum STGVInformation Centre, providing convenient charging services for Guangdong electric vehicles entering the urban areas via the HZMB Hong Kong Port or before returning to Guangdong, along with the latest information on the STGV. The Charging Station has been equipped with ultra fastchargers suitable for both local and Guangdong vehicles.

  Guangdong drivers may refer to the Tourist Parking Guides to plan their journeys by self-driving and matching public transport to explore Hong Kong's diverse appeals in culture, sports, exhibitions, shopping and theme parks, thereby diverting Guangdong vehicles to different districts and benefitting various trades and sectors under the inflow of additional tourists.

  Since November, the TD has been in collaboration with the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Guangdong and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Development Office in a series of thematic posts on Mainland social media. Details of different parts of the STGV (Entry into Urban Area) are also provided on the thematic webpage, the application and driving information kit, publicity leaflets and tutorial videos. The HKSAR Government will implement the STGV in an orderly manner so that it will be well received by users, reassuring to the public, and beneficial to the community at large."
​香港海關打擊航空旅客走私香煙及搗破相關私煙貯存倉庫（附圖）,2025-12-18 18:20,2025-12-18 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/18/P2025121800637.htm,"香港海關於九月至十二月展開打擊航空旅客走私香煙及搗破相關私煙貯存倉庫的執法行動，成功瓦解一個利用航空旅客走私香煙的跨國犯罪集團，檢獲共約一千一百六十四萬支私煙及約一百四十萬件另類吸煙產品，估計市值共約五千六百五十萬元，私煙應課稅值約三千八百五十萬元，拘捕六十一名涉案人士。

行動期間，海關於機場破獲三十八宗旅客走私香煙案件，檢獲共約一百四十四萬支私煙，拘捕四十三名由東亞和東南亞地區飛抵香港的入境旅客，年齡介乎二十一歲至六十一歲。

海關對相關案件進行情報分析及深入調查後，發現有私煙集團利用酒店房間作為私煙集散點，經整理及裝箱後將私煙運送至工業大廈或商業大廈的儲存倉庫暫存，再供應予各區或運送至物流場以轉口至外地。

海關遂於各區進行一連串的打擊行動，搗破多個私煙集散點和貯存倉庫，包括三個位於荃灣、汀九和屯門的酒店房間、五個位於葵涌、粉嶺、屯門和鴨脷洲的工業大廈單位、一個位於荃灣的商業大廈單位及一個青衣物流場，檢獲共約一千零二十萬支私煙及一百四十萬件另類吸煙產品，拘捕十八名年齡介乎二十二歲至五十二歲的男子。

五十七名被捕人士因處理或管有未完稅香煙、未有向海關人員作出申報或進口另類吸煙產品，違反《應課稅品條例》或《進出口條例》，已被落案起訴，其中三十五人已在裁判法院被定罪及判處監禁四星期至九個月。海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關相信是次行動有效從源頭打擊及堵截本地的私煙供應鍵。此外，部分檢獲私煙的品牌在香港並不常見，不排除犯罪集團計劃將該些私煙轉運到其他煙草稅較高的地區圖利。

海關會繼續根據風險評估和情報分析從源頭堵截，並透過針對貯存及分銷販賣多管齊下的執法策略，嚴厲打擊私煙活動。

根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。此外，根據《進出口條例》，任何人進口另類吸煙產品即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Hong Kong Customs combats illicit cigarette smuggling activities involving air passengers and dismantles related illicit cigarette storage centres (with photos) ,2025-12-18 18:20,2025-12-18 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/18/P2025121800638.htm,"Hong Kong Customs mounted enforcement operations to combat illicit cigarette smuggling activities involving air passengers and shut down related illicit cigarette storage centres between September and December, successfully neutralising a transnational syndicate that smuggled illicit cigarettes through air passengers. A total of about 11.64 million illicit cigarettes and 1.4 million alternative smoking products were seized, with an estimated market value of about $56.5 million. The duty potential of the illicit cigarettes was about $38.5 million. Sixty-one persons connected with the cases were arrested.

During the operations, Customs detected 38 illicit cigarette smuggling cases involving passengers at the airport and seized a total of about 1.44 million illicit cigarettes. Forty-three passengers, aged between 21 and 61 and arriving in Hong Kong from the East and Southeast Asian regions, were arrested.

Following intelligence analyses and in-depth investigations into the cases, Customs discovered that a cigarette smuggling syndicate had been using hotel rooms as distribution points for the illicit cigarettes. After sorting and packaging, the illicit cigarettes would be transported to storage centres in industrial or commercial buildings for temporary storage and subsequently supplied to different districts or transported to logistics centres for overseas transshipment.

Customs then mounted a series of enforcement actions and raided various illicit cigarette distribution points and storage centres, including three hotel rooms in Tsuen Wan, Ting Kau and Tuen Mun, five industrial building units in Kwai Chung, Fanling, Tuen Mun and Ap Lei Chau, one commercial building unit in Tsuen Wan, and one logistics centre in Tsing Yi. A total of about 10.2 million illicit cigarettes and 1.4 million alternative smoking products were seized, and 18 men, aged between 22 and 52, were arrested.

Fifty-seven of the arrestees had been charged for dealing with or possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes, failing to declare them to Customs officers, or importing alternative smoking products, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) or the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO), while 35 of them were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for between four weeks and nine months at the Magistrates' Courts. Customs welcomes the sentences. The custodial sentences have imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflect the seriousness of the offences.

It is believed that the operations have effectively disrupted the source and the local supply chains of the illicit cigarettes. As some of the brands of the illicit cigarettes seized were uncommon in Hong Kong, Customs believes that the syndicate planned to transport part of the illicit cigarettes to regions with higher tobacco duty for profit.

Customs will continue its risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as through its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storage, distribution and peddling to vigorously combat illicit cigarette activities.

Under the DCO, any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years. In addition, under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

「綠置居2025」將推售一個位於九龍灣的新建綠置居發展項目，提供超過1 400個單位，單位實用面積介乎約26.0平方米至約43.6平方米（約280平方呎至約469平方呎）；當中有約四分之一為大單位，實用面積約41.5平方米至約43.6平方米（約447平方呎至約469平方呎）（見附件三及附件四）。此外，「綠置居2025」亦會推售新一批租者置其屋計劃回收單位。

定價

房委會繼續以可負擔水平來釐定居屋和綠置居單位的售價，即以申請人的負擔能力為基礎，即至少有75%推售的單位可讓入息水平達家庭每月入息中位數的非業主住戶家庭，動用不超過其每月入息的40%作按揭供款。在此以可負擔水平來釐定售價的基礎計算下，「居屋2025」折扣率定於評定市值折減30%，即以七折出售。

五個新居屋發展項目單位的售價介乎約150萬元至約480萬元。單位平均售價大約為278萬元。假設承造單位售價九成的按揭、按揭還款期30年，並以現行按揭利率約3.5%計算，每月按揭還款額約11,200元。

綠置居單位的折扣率會較上一次居屋銷售計劃的折扣率高10%。按「居屋2025」的折扣率為30%，「綠置居2025」推售的綠置居單位平均售價會定於評定市值折減40%的水平（即以六折出售）。新綠置居發展項目單位的售價介乎約168萬元至約354萬元，單位平均售價大約為268萬元。假設承造單位售價九成半的按揭、按揭還款期30年，並以現行按揭利率約3.5%計算，每月按揭還款額約11,400元。

落實施政報告新措施

為協助青年向上流動，由「居屋2025」起，選擇參加「青年計劃（居屋）」的40歲以下白表青年家庭及青年一人申請者會獲分派多一個抽籤號碼。此外，為增加申請者成功購買單位的機會，「居屋2025」和「綠置居2025」將繼續實施優化安排，向前兩次曾連續申請同一類別資助出售單位銷售計劃而未能成功購買單位的申請者，分派多一個抽籤號碼，居屋和綠置居將會分開計算。

房委會由「居屋2025」起，將綠表與白表申請者的配額比例由40：60調整至50：50，同時增加居屋及綠置居面積較大單位的比例，以鼓勵公屋租戶購買資助出售單位。事實上，「居屋2025」將推售較大單位的數量已由以往佔總數約20%提升至約25%。此外，若現時的項目設計條件合適，房委會亦會逐步優化單位空間的應用。因此這新一批推售的居屋單位，已有超過一半採用新的「開門見光」設計，讓住戶回家時有更好的體驗，亦令住戶能更靈活使用廚房外空間，如擺放鞋櫃、儲物櫃等。未來單位的設計亦將會全面向這個新方向發展。

由於未來五年整體公營房屋供應預期穩步上升，在居屋供應增加的前提下，即使把綠白表比例調整至50：50，白表申請者購買居屋單位的機會仍會增加25%。一如以往，如綠表申請者未能用盡有關配額，房委會會將剩餘配額撥予白表申請者，反之亦然。

為鼓勵業主循置業階梯向上流動，房委會將由「居屋2025」及「綠置居2025」開始，放寬新推售資助出售單位於公開市場出售限制的年期，由首次轉讓日期起計十五年，縮短至十年。

「白居二2025」

為回應白表申請者對「白居二」配額持續殷切的需求，房委會由「白居二2025」起再增加1 000個配額，使配額總數增至7 000個，其中2 000個撥會予40歲以下的青年申請者，而其餘5 000個屬一般配額。家庭和一人申請者的配額比例維持9：1，未用盡的家庭配額會撥予一人申請者，反之亦然。

白表申請者的入息及資產限額

與此同時，房委會亦已參考現行機制檢討了白表申請者的入息及資產限額。「居屋2025」和「白居二2025」白表家庭申請者的入息限額將維持與「居屋2024」及「白居二2024」的相同水平，即為每月60,000元。按照現行安排，白表一人申請者的入息限額定為家庭申請者的一半，即為每月30,000元。雖然入息限額維持不變，由於私人樓宇中的非業主住戶數量增加，預計合資格住戶數目將較「居屋2024」及「白居二2024」增加約17 500戶至357 000戶。

根據現行機制，白表資產限額本應輕微下調至1,220,000元。然而，房委會認為應為申請人提供適當的緩衝，並維持白表家庭申請者及一人申請者的資產限額至「居屋2024」及「白居二2024」相同的水平，分別為1,230,000元及615,000元。

在會議上，有小組委員會委員關注大埔宏福苑火災受災人士的長遠住宿支援事宜。房委會留意到政府將全面收集受災人士的意見，作出分析，並提出長遠方案，協助受影響的家庭重建家園。未來房委會會以最大的彈性，積極全力配合政府的相關工作。"
"HA approves implementation arrangements for Sale of Home Ownership Scheme Flats 2025, Sale of Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme Flats 2025 and White Form Secondary Market Scheme 2025",2025-12-18 18:03,2025-12-18 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/18/P2025121800574.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Housing Authority:

 The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) Subsidised Housing Committee (SHC) approved the average selling prices and sales arrangements for the Sale of Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) Flats 2025 (HOS 2025) and the Sale of Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme (GSH) Flats 2025 (GSH 2025), the arrangements for the White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) 2025 (WSM 2025), as well as the White Form (WF) income and asset limits for HOS 2025 and WSM 2025.

 ""The HA has long been striving to enhance the housing ladder through the provision of various types of subsidised sales flat (SSF) schemes and continuous enhancement of relevant arrangements in order to assist Public Rental Housing (PRH) tenants with better financial capabilities and other eligible applicants to achieve upward mobility by purchasing SSFs. The HA is going to launch the HOS 2025, the GSH 2025 and the WSM 2025 together and start inviting applications in the second quarter of 2026. The HOS 2025 and the GSH 2025 offer a total of over 9 700 new flats while the WSM 2025 offers 7 000 quotas allowing successful applicants to purchase a flat with premium unpaid in the secondary market,"" a spokesman for the HA said.

HOS 2025 and GSH 2025

Flats for sale

 Flats for sale under the HOS 2025 include a total of over 8 300 flats in five new HOS developments at a wide variety of locations (including Kai Tak, Kam Tin, Tseung Kwan O, Ping Shan, and Tung Chung), with saleable areas ranging from about 26.1 square metres to about 52.0 sq m (about 281 square feet to about 560 sq ft). Larger flats, with saleable areas ranging from about 41.2 sq m to about 52.0 sq m (about 443 sq ft to about 560 sq ft), will account for about a quarter of the total number of flats (see Annex 1 and Annex 2).

 Flats for sale under the GSH 2025 include over 1 400 new flats from a new GSH development in Kowloon Bay, with saleable areas ranging from about 26.0 sq m to about 43.6 sq m (about 280 sq ft to about 469 sq ft). Larger flats, with saleable areas ranging from about 41.5 sq m to about 43.6 sq m (about 447 sq ft to about 469 sq ft), will account for about a quarter of the total number of flats (see Annex 3 and Annex 4). Moreover, a new batch of recovered Tenants Purchase Scheme flats will also be offered for sale under the GSH 2025.

Pricing

 The HA continues to price HOS and GSH flats at an affordable level, which was based on the affordability of the applicants, i.e. at least 75 per cent of the flats for sale can allow non-owner occupier households earning the median monthly household income to spend no more than 40 per cent of their monthly income on mortgage payments. Based on this principle of setting selling prices at an affordable level, the discount for the HOS 2025 was set at 30 per cent from the assessed market values (for sale at 70 per cent of the assessed market values).

 The selling prices of flats in the five new HOS developments range from about $1.5 million to about $4.8 million, with an average selling price of about $2.78 million. The mortgage payment is about $11,200 per month, assuming that the buyer takes out a mortgage at 90 per cent of the flat price for a mortgage repayment period of 30 years at a prevailing mortgage interest rate of about 3.5 per cent.

 GSH flats will be sold at a discount of 10 per cent more than that of the preceding HOS sale exercise. Since the discount rate for the HOS 2025 was set at 30 per cent, the average selling prices of all GSH flats under the GSH 2025 would be set at 40 per cent discount from the assessed market values (i.e. for sale at 60 per cent of the assessed market values). The selling prices of flats in the new GSH development range from about $1.68 million to about $3.54 million with an average selling price of about $2.68 million. The mortgage payment is about $11,400 per month, assuming that the buyer takes out a mortgage at 95 per cent of the flat price for a mortgage repayment period of 30 years at a prevailing mortgage interest rate of about 3.5 per cent.

Implementation of new measures under Policy Address

 To facilitate upward mobility of young people, starting from the HOS 2025, an extra ballot number will be allocated to young family applicants and young one-person applicants aged below 40 with WF status who opted to join the Youth Scheme (HOS). Moreover, the HOS 2025 and the GSH 2025 will continue to implement the enhanced arrangement of allocating an extra ballot number to applicants who have failed to purchase an SSF in the last two consecutive sale exercises of the same type of SSF. The HOS and the GSH will be conducted separately.

 The HA will increase the quota allocation ratio between the GF and the WF from 40:60 to 50:50 starting from the HOS 2025, and at the same time increase the ratio of larger flats in HOS and GSH projects to encourage more PRH tenants to purchase SSFs. In fact, the ratio of larger flats has been increased from about 20 per cent in the past to about 25 per cent under the HOS 2025. Moreover, when design conditions of existing developments permit, the HA will progressively optimise the space utilisation of the flats. Therefore, in this new batch of HOS flats offered for sale, more than half have adopted the new design, providing residents with an improved experience upon returning home and enabling more flexible use of the space outside the kitchen, such as for placing a shoe cabinet, storage cabinet, etc. Future designs will continue to develop along this new approach.

 Given the supply of HOS flats in the next five years is expected to increase steadily, even the quota allocation ratio between GF and WF applicants has been adjusted to 50:50, and opportunities for WF applicants to purchase HOS flats will still increase by about 25 per cent. As in the past, the flexibility to reallocate any unused quota from the GF queue to WF queue and vice versa will be maintained.

 To encourage upward mobility through the housing ladder, starting from the HOS 2025 and the GSH 2025, the HA will shorten the alienation restriction period of new SSFs put up for sale in the open market, from 15 years to 10 years from the date of the first assignment.

WSM 2025

 In response to the keen demand of WSM quotas from WF applicants, the HA is further increasing the quota by 1 000 to 7 000 starting from WSM 2025, which includes 2 000 quotas for young applicants aged below 40 while the remaining 5 000 are ordinary quotas. The allocation ratio for family and one-person applicants is kept at 9:1 and any unused family quotas will be reallocated to one-person applicants and vice versa.

White Form Income and Asset Limits

 At the same time, the HA has also reviewed the WF income and asset limits with reference to the existing mechanism. For WF family applicants of the HOS 2025 and the WSM 2025, the income limit will be maintained at the same level of $60,000 per month as the HOS 2024 and the WSM 2024. According to the existing arrangement, the income limits for WF one-person applicants will be set at half the limits for family applicants at $30,000 per month. Although the income limits remain unchanged, given the number of non-owner occupied household in private sector increases, compared with HOS 2024 and WSM 2024, the eligible household number is anticipated to increase by 17 500 to 357 000.

 While the asset limit for WF applicants should be slightly adjusted downwards to $1,220,000 according to the existing mechanism, the HA considers that it would be appropriate to provide applicants with a buffer and maintain the asset limits for WF family applicants and one-person applicants at the same level of $1,230,000 and $615,000 respectively as the HOS 2024 and the WSM 2024.

  At the meeting, some SHC members raised concerns about longâterm accommodation support for those affected by the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. The HA noted that the Government will conduct a comprehensive collection of residents' views, carry out an analysis and formulate longâterm plans to help the affected families rebuild their homes. Going forward, the HA will exercise the utmost flexibility and will fully and proactively support the Government in taking forward the relevant initiatives."
Hong Kong Customs special operation combats mobile hawker selling counterfeit goods (with photos),2025-12-18 17:51,2025-12-18 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/18/P2025121800609.htm,"Hong Kong Customs on December 16 conducted a special operation in Kai Tak and Kwai Chung, and cracked down on one mobile hawker stall and its storage place. A total of about 1 300 items of suspected counterfeit apparel with an estimated market value of about $340,000 were seized.

Customs earlier found that a mobile hawker was selling suspected counterfeit goods in Kai Tak. After a full investigation, Customs officers took enforcement action on December 16 and raided a mobile hawker stall in Kai Tak as well as its storage place in Kwai Chung. The batch of suspected counterfeit apparel was seized.

During the operation, one man, aged 37 and suspected to be connected with the case, was arrested. The arrested man has been released on bail pending further investigation. The investigation is ongoing.

With Christmas and New Year holidays approaching, Customs will continue to step up inspection and enforcement actions to vigorously combat different kinds of counterfeit goods activities in order to safeguard consumers' rights.

Customs appeals to consumers to purchase goods at reputable shops and to check with the trademark owners or their authorised agents if the authenticity of a product is in doubt. Customs also reminds traders not to sell counterfeit goods and to be cautious and prudent with their merchandising since selling counterfeit goods is a serious crime and offenders are liable to criminal sanctions.

Under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, any person who sells or possesses for sale any goods with a forged trademark commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

Members of the public may report any suspected counterfeiting activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002). "

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-18 17:30,2025-12-18 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/18/P2025121800581.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 18), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.    
  
Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. As the CHP and relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails recently, the CHP continues to appeal to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

  The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm. All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

  Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-12-18 17:30,2025-12-18 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/18/P2025121800577.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月十八日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。本港今年累計錄得81宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應近期有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。鑑於中心與相關政府部門近期會在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。

針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。
