Latest figures of primary healthcare services provided by Health Bureau to residents affected by Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire,2025-12-25 10:00,2025-12-25 10:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/25/P2025122400633.htm,"  The Health Bureau (HHB) announced earlier the medical support provided for residents affected by the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. At present, the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts in Hong Kong serve as hubs to co-ordinate various primary healthcare services as needed for the affected residents. The HHB announced today (December 25) the latest figures of these services:

DHC hotlines

  Under the co-ordination of the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission), the DHCs across all 18 districts in Hong Kong have set up hotlines since December 1 (see Annex 1) to provide personalised case management services for affected residents, offering more convenient and comprehensive medical support. The support includes pairing the affected residents with free consultation services provided by private family doctors and Chinese medicine (CM) practitioners, co-ordinating arrangements for follow-up appointments and medication refills at the Hospital Authority (HA)'s Family Medicine Out-patient (FMOP) Services as necessary, and making referrals to necessary healthcare, nursing and medication services, as well as psychological support. The services co-ordinated by DHCs are not subject to district boundaries. For example, the Centres may assist affected residents in transferring HA FMOP follow-up appointments and medication refill service points, from the Tai Po District to another location, thereby sparing residents the need for travelling across districts. As of December 23, the DHCs hotlines across all 18 districts have received over 176 enquiries in total.

Free consultations by family doctors and CM practitioners and free denture replacement services

  The HHB introduced a free family doctor service scheme and free CM consultation services on December 4 and 15 respectively to support the primary healthcare needs of the affected residents until February 28 next year. Case managers of the DHCs will arrange for them to receive up to three free consultations by family doctors and CM practitioners respectively based on their individual situations and preferences. The service covers the provision of medication and related treatments. Additionally, free denture replacement services were launched on December 23. Residents in need can receive at least one free dental consultation and one follow-up appointment (subject to clinical need) through the arrangement of the DHCs. The services include denture replacement and oral treatment.

  As of December 23, more than 300 private family doctors have participated in the free family doctor service scheme, covering more than 450 service points that include eight private hospitals. So far, 57 affected residents have been arranged to receive free family doctor consultations. As for the free CM consultation services, more than 360 CM practitioners have participated, covering more than 600 service points, and 16 residents have been arranged to receive the services so far. Regarding free denture replacement services, more than 80 private dentists have participated, covering 106 service points.

HA's healthcare services

  All individuals injured in the fire and admitted to public hospitals under the HA will receive full fee waivers for all necessary healthcare services (including drugs and medical devices) throughout the entire process of their treatment and rehabilitation. A total of 79 patients received treatment at various public hospitals due to the fire. As of December 23, 65 of them had already recovered and were discharged, and the remaining 14 are in stable condition. Healthcare staff will continue to provide appropriate treatment and care to these patients.

  Moreover, all residents of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers) are eligible for full medical fee waivers until December 31, 2026. The waivers cover in-patient services, family medicine and specialist out-patient clinics (SOPCs) services (including psychiatry SOPCs), accident and emergency services, day hospitals, day procedures, community services, and Chinese Medicine Clinics cum Training and Research Centres under the HA. As of December 23, the HA has provided necessary healthcare services to around 1 600 affected residents.

Mental health support

  The ""18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline"" immediately deployed additional staff and strengthened training for its call handlers on the day of the fire incident to cope with the emotional distress that the public may experience due to the incident. From the time of the incident to December 23, the hotline has received over 8 300 calls, around 660 of which were related to the fire incident. The WhatsApp service has handled 420 messages, with about 50 of them concerning the fire incident. The HA's 24-hour Mental Health Direct hotline, manned by psychiatric nurses, offers professional advice and support on mental health issues to callers, including provision of risk assessment and referral to the HA's mental health services as appropriate. As of December 23, the Mental Health Direct hotline has received 89 calls related to the fire incident, with 31 of them coming from the affected citizens.

  The HHB will continue to provide comprehensive primary healthcare support to the affected residents. The HHB also designed the relevant service workflow from the residents' perspective, allowing them to receive convenient and effective medical support simply through the DHCs (see Annex 2)."
HKSAR Government expresses dissatisfaction with and opposition to unfounded comments by individual so-called human rights experts on Lai Chee-ying case,2025-12-24 23:45,2025-12-25 00:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400777.htm,"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government today (December 24) expressed dissatisfaction with and opposition to the unfounded comments by individual so-called human rights experts after the court of the HKSAR convicted Lai Chee-ying of offences of endangering national security in strict accordance with the law and evidence.

A spokesperson for the HKSAR Government pointed out, ""The HKSAR Government noted that individual so-called human rights experts have entirely no respect for the HKSAR court's independent judgment of the case, which had been made on the basis of facts and evidence. They also refused to acknowledge the evidence set out in the reasons for verdict, and refused to understand the court's considerations and the reasons for verdict. Instead, they wantonly launched attacks, slandered and attacked the HKSAR Government, with despicable political manipulations to demand the immediate release of Lai Chee-ying, overriding the rule of law with politics and confounding right and wrong. Their despicable intent to interfere with the court's sentencing has been seen through by all. The HKSAR Government has to refute resolutely to set the record straight.""

Court's conviction verdict was entirely free from any political considerations

""The court's reasons for verdict in this case are 855 pages long, which are fully open for public inspection, and include the court's analysis of the relevant legal principles and evidence, as well as the reasons for convicting Lai Chee-ying and the three defendant companies in full detail. The court clearly pointed out in the reasons for verdict that Lai Chee-ying was not on trial for his political views or beliefs. The court's conviction verdict is well-founded and reasoned, fully demonstrating that the court has made its decision on the case strictly in accordance with the law and evidence, free from any interference, and absolutely free of any political considerations.""

The spokesperson stressed, ""Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law and has always adhered to the principle that laws must be obeyed and lawbreakers be held accountable. Article 5 of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and section 2 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security. Any suggestion that certain individuals or organisations should be immune from legal consequences for their illegal acts is no different from advocating a special privilege to break the law, and this totally runs contrary to the spirit of the rule of law.""

The Lai Chee-ying case has nothing to do with freedom of speech and of the press at all

The spokesman pointed out, ""These so-called human rights experts have conflated the criminal acts in this case with freedom of speech and of the press, with the purpose of misleading the public and defaming the HKSAR. In fact, the Lai Chee-ying case has nothing to do with freedom of speech and of the press at all. Over the years, the defendants were using journalism as a guise to commit acts that brought harm to our country and Hong Kong.

""The public trial of this case revealed Lai Chee-ying's close management and hands-on control of the editorial direction of Apple Daily. Lai Chee-ying had repeatedly and personally colluded with foreign forces, begging for sanctions and hostile actions against the Central Authorities and the HKSAR Government. The court clearly pointed out that Lai Chee-ying's only intent, whether pre or post HKNSL, was to seek the downfall of the Communist Party of China, even though the ultimate cost was the sacrifice of the interests of the people of the People's Republic of China and the HKSAR.

""Anyone who vilify the rule of law and human rights situation in the HKSAR using this case is fact-twisting and has no integrity at all. We have to emphasise that the HKNSL and the SNSO clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security. The rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of the press, of speech and of publication, enjoyed by Hong Kong people under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to the HKSAR, are protected in accordance with the law. However, like all other places in the world, journalists, like everyone else, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. According to the principles established by Article 19 of the ICCPR, the European Convention on Human Rights and relevant jurisprudence, when the media and journalists publish opinions, information and articles, they must observe and discharge 'special duties and responsibilities', including the protection of national security and public order; journalists must, in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism', act in good faith on an accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information, so as to be entitled to the protection of freedom of speech and press freedom.""

The spokesman reiterated, ""The HKSAR Government will continue to resolutely, fully and faithfully implement the HKNSL, the SNSO and other relevant laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, to effectively prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law, whilst upholding the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents in accordance with the law, so as to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of the principle of 'one country, two systems'. The HKSAR Government urges the relevant so-called human rights experts to understand the facts clearly and stop making any unfounded criticisms."""
特區政府就個別所謂人權專家對「黎智英案」的不實批評表示不滿和反對,2025-12-24 22:49,2025-12-24 23:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400757.htm,"​香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（十二月二十四日）對個別所謂人權專家就黎智英被控危害國家安全罪行及特區法庭嚴格依照法律和證據作出定罪判決作出的不實批評，表示強烈不滿和反對。

特區政府發言人指出︰「特區政府留意到有個別所謂人權專家，根本沒有尊重特區法庭基於事實和證據就案件所作的獨立審判，拒絕正視裁決理由羅列的各項證據，並拒絕理解法庭的考慮和裁決理由，就肆意發動攻擊，污衊和攻擊特區政府，及以卑劣的政治操弄，不斷渲染黎智英應立即獲釋。他們完全是以政治凌駕法治，顛倒是非，其干預法庭判刑的卑劣用心昭然若揭，必須嚴厲直斥其非，以正視聽。」

法庭的定罪裁決絕無任何政治考慮

「法庭就本案頒下的裁決理由長達855頁，完全公開供公眾查閱，鉅細無遺地説明法庭對相關法律原則和證據的分析，以及裁定黎智英和三間被告公司有罪的理由。法庭在裁決理由中清楚表明，黎智英並非因其政治觀點或信念受審。法庭的定罪裁決有理有節，充分展現法庭嚴格依照法律和證據作出裁決，不受任何干涉，更絕無任何政治考慮。」

發言人強調：「香港特區是法治社會，一直秉持有法必依、違法必究的原則。《香港國安法》第五條和《維護國家安全條例》第2條明確訂明防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪，應當堅持法治原則。倡議某種背景的人或組織不應就其違法行為和活動受到法律制裁，等同給予其犯法特權，完全違反法治精神。」

「黎智英案」與言論和新聞自由完全無關

發言人指出：「這些所謂人權專家又將『黎智英案』的犯罪行為與言論和新聞自由混為一談，目的是混淆視聽，污衊香港特區。事實是，『黎智英案』與言論和新聞自由完全無關，各被告多年來只是利用新聞報道為幌子，行禍國害港之實。」

「本案公開審訊中，清楚揭示了黎智英密切管理和親自控制《蘋果日報》的編採方向，更多次親自勾結外國勢力，乞求對中央和香港特區政府實施制裁和進行敵對行動。法庭清楚指出，不論在《香港國安法》實施前或後，黎智英的唯一意圖就是，即使要犧牲中國和香港特區人民的利益，也要謀求中國共產黨倒台。」

「任何借本案炒作詆譭香港特區法治和人權狀況的人，都是歪曲事實、毫無誠信之徒。我們必須強調，《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》均明確規定維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，亦依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》、《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港特區的有關規定下享有的權利和自由，包括新聞、言論、出版等自由。但與世界其他地方一樣，新聞從業員和其他人一樣都有義務遵守所有法律。根據《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》第十九條、《歐洲人權公約》以及相關判例確立的原則，傳媒及新聞從業員在發布言論、資訊和文章時，必須遵守和履行『特別責任和義務』，包括保障國家安全或公共秩序；新聞工作者必須按『負責任新聞作業』原則真誠地行事，以準確事實為基礎，並提供準確可靠的資訊，方可獲言論和新聞自由的保障。」

發言人重申︰「特區政府將繼續堅定不移全面準確實施《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》及香港特區其他維護國家安全的相關法律，依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，同時依法保障香港市民的權利和自由，確保『一國兩制』實踐行穩致遠。特區政府促請有關所謂人權專家認清事實，停止作出任何毫無根據的批評。」"

Strategies to stay healthy during festive holidays,2025-12-24 20:50,2025-12-24 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400704.htm,"With Christmas and New Year holidays approaching, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (December 24) reminded members of the public to pay attention to their health. Individuals should avoid excessive alcohol, salt, sugar and fat intake, and ensure adequate rest and sleep to prevent compromising the normal functioning of the immune system, which could make one more susceptible to illness. Regardless of whether they are staying in Hong Kong or travelling abroad for the holidays, the public should practise strict personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times, and get seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) early. These measures can help prevent various infectious diseases that are more prevalent in winter or associated with travel.

  ""During gatherings with family, relatives and friends, people often unknowingly consume excessive amounts of alcohol or sugary drinks, cakes, desserts, and crispy snacks such as potato chips and fried food. Additionally, the Hong Kong Observatory forecasts a drop in temperatures over the next two days, which may lead more people to enjoy hotpot. During hot pot meals, people tend to add substantial amounts of high-fat and high-salt condiments. Amid the festive atmosphere, I would like to remind the public that it is crucial to control the amount of food intake, opt for high-fibre and low-fat food (consuming more fruit and vegetable and choosing steaming or boiling over frying), reduce the consumption of high-sugar and high-salt beverages and pastries, and maintain food hygiene. Get adequate exercise and rest so you can enjoy the holidays while staying healthy,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

Stay away from alcohol
------------------------------

The International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen, placing it in the highest risk category alongside smoking and asbestos. Alcohol consumption causes various cancers, including cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colorectum, and female breasts. The risk rises with increasing alcohol use. It is worth to note that all alcoholic beverages, including beer, wine or spirits, carry carcinogenic risks.

  ""Alcohol can cause cancer and there is no safe drinking level. Even small amount of drinking may harm your health. We encourage the public to celebrate the festive season without alcoholic. Those who choose to have alcoholic beverages should limit their intake and avoid binge drinking (refers to consumption of approximately five cans of beers or five pegs of spirits on a single occasion) to reduce risks of alcoholic intoxication, accidental injury, traffic accidents and practising unsafe sex. Meanwhile, alcohol is high in calories, carrying 7kcal per gram, which can easily lead to weight gain. During the festive season, we encourage everyone to embrace healthier alternatives to drinking, such as healthy eating, outdoor activities or spending quality time with family and friends, to welcome a more fulfilling new year,"" Dr Tsui reminded.

The DH's Change for Health website has an electronic alcohol screening and brief intervention (e-SBI) tool (www.change4health.gov.hk/en/alcohol_aware/questionnaire/index.html), enabling the public to assess their drinking risk and obtain personalised health advice. If assessments indicate a high risk of alcohol consumption or probable dependence, members of the public should seek professional assistance early.

Smart diet
--------------

Whether celebrating at home or dining out, members of the public should adhere to a balanced diet and the principle of ""3 Low, 1 High"" (i.e. low fat, low sodium (salt), low sugar, and high dietary fibre). In additional, the public should pay attention to the order in which they eat their meals and start with vegetables to increase satiety. Consume at least three servings of vegetables daily, with one serving is roughly equivalent to a bowl of salad. If needed, choose vinegar or a small amount of olive oil as salad dressing. Choose low-fat meat dishes (such as skinless turkey or fish fillets) that are prepared by baking, roasting, steaming or boiling. Avoid processed meats such as cold cuts platters. Finally, avoid high-fat, high-sugar desserts like cheesecake. Instead, opt for fresh fruit as a dessert. When dining out, choose restaurants of the EatSmart Restaurant Star + Campaign, and select ""More Fruit and Vegetables"" dishes and ""3 Less"" dishes with less oil, salt and sugar.

  For snacks, choose healthier options like baked potato chips, baked sweet potato chips, corn chips, unsalted plain nuts and low-fat popcorn. Control portion sizes or opt for fruit snacks to meet the goal of at least two servings of fruit daily. Avoid consuming large quantities of greasy and high-sugar snacks (such as potato chips, prawn crackers, buttered popcorn and chocolate). Opt for sugar-free or low-sugar beverages instead of alcohol and high-sugar drinks. Members of the public should drink plenty of water or prepare low-calorie, tasty beverages at home (such as lime mixed with sparkling water).

Maintain a balance of exercise and rest
-----------------------------------------------

  The DH encourages the public to take care of their physical and mental well-being during the festive season. By balancing exercise and rest, everyone can enjoy a truly healthy and pleasant long holiday. The WHO recommends adults to engage in at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity weekly, such as brisk walking or cycling; or at least 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, like running or jumping rope. Exercise not only helps burn off extra calories consumed during the holidays but also reduces the risk of non-communicable diseases and improves mental health.

  ""Walking is a simple and accessible physical activity suitable for the whole family. It improves cardiovascular fitness, strengthens muscles and bones. Walking also helps prevent obesity, hypertension and diabetes. During the festive season, I recommend taking a walk outdoors with friends and family. It relaxes both body and mind while integrating healthy habits into joyful moments. You can choose from nearby neighbourhoods, waterfront promenades, parks, or country trails to easily embark on a walking journey,"" Dr Tsui said.

Prevention of communicable diseases
-----------------------------------------------

""The local influenza activity remained at a high level. Influenza activity has continued to increase or reached a high level in most areas of the North Hemisphere, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Europe, South Korea, Japan and the Chinese Mainland. Receiving SIV is still one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of hospitalisation and death from infection. Public should receive vaccination as soon as possible regardless of staying locally or plan to travel abroad. The activity of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) also started to increase in many regions in North America and Europe. Prevention of RSV infection is the same as that for other respiratory diseases. Members of the public should maintain good personal, hand and environmental hygiene,"" he added.

During holiday gatherings, it is especially important to pay attention to personal hygiene and take preventive measures. People should wash their hands thoroughly before and after touching mouth and eyes, after touching public equipment such as handrails and door handles, and after coughing or sneezing. Public with respiratory symptoms should wear a surgical mask, refrain from going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly.

Dr Tsui reminded the public that norovirus is more active in winter (around December to March). As norovirus is highly contagious, individuals may become infected after being exposed to even a small amount of norovirus. To prevent acute gastroenteritis and norovirus infection, members of public should perform hand hygiene frequently, especially before handling food or eating, and after using the toilet. Wash hands with liquid soap and water, and rub for at least 20 seconds, then rinse with water and dry with a disposable paper towel or hand dryer. Since alcohol is not effective in killing norovirus, alcohol-based handrubs are not a substitute for handwashing with soap and water. During the festive season, members of public have more opportunities to have parties with food delivery services or hotpot. To prevent food poisoning, apart from maintaining personal hygiene, they should also consume thoroughly washed and cooked food. For shellfish, the shells should be well scrubbed and the internal organs be removed before consumption. In addition, never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce. Use different chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination. For more food safety tips, please visit thewebpage of the Centre for Food Safetyof the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.

Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. Public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries. To prevent mosquito-borne diseases, travellers should wear loose, light-coloured, long-sleeved tops and trousers and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or exposed parts of the body. Travellers returning from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong.

For more details, please visit the recent CHP's press release and theTravel Health Service's website to learn about the public health situation at your destination and the vaccines or preventive measures that should be taken."
FSD conducts special fire safety inspection and enforcement operation,2025-12-24 20:32,2025-12-24 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400659.htm,"  The fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po has drawn widespread public attention to building fire safety. With the Christmas holiday approaching, the Fire Services Department (FSD) conducted a territory-wide special fire safety inspection and enforcement operation against commercial buildings with higher fire risks for two consecutive days starting yesterday (December 23) to ensure public safety.

  In regulating the fire safety of licensed premises such as restaurants, the FSD specifies relevant fire safety requirements to licence applicants and conducts inspections to ensure that the premises comply with applicable fire safety standards. Nevertheless, inadequate management of buildings and individual premises may give rise to potential fire hazards, for example, smoke stop doors being wedged open, means of escape (MoE) being obstructed or locked, the depositing of combustible articles in MoE, or fire service installation or equipment (FSIs) not being kept in efficient working order. In addition, commercial buildings housing a large number of licensed premises have higher fire risks than ordinary buildings, as these establishments are more crowded.

  Anticipating a significant increase in the number of people visiting commercial buildings with a higher number of licensed premises, the FSD targeted 132 such commercial buildings and conducted a territory-wide special fire safety inspection and enforcement operation. A total of 376 Fire Hazard Abatement Notices were issued for various fire hazards, and 53 prosecutions were initiated. Among the 132 buildings, 57 were suspected of lacking annual inspections for FSIs. The FSD has followed up in a serious manner and will implement enforcement action for any irregularities identified.

  In addition to inspections and enforcement, the fire personnel also carried out fire prevention publicity and education during the operation to raise the fire safety awareness among property owners and the public, with a view to preventing fire incidents.

  To further strengthen fire safety management of these types of commercial buildings and enhance fire safety awareness among property owners and the public, the FSD will enhance communication with the Property Management Services Authority, the Hong Kong Association of Property Management Companies Limited and other relevant stakeholders to introduce targeted regulatory and publicity measures. This collaboration aims to reinforce the partnership between the Government and the property management sector, ensuring that the FSIs in commercial buildings are properly kept in efficient working order. It also encourages building owners, tenants and property management agents to uphold sound building management practices and eliminate fire hazards.

  Through concerted efforts and information sharing, the department aims to jointly foster a robust fire safety culture with all parties and contribute to a safer and more reliable community."
消防處展開特別消防安全巡查與執法行動,2025-12-24 20:31,2025-12-24 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400656.htm,"​大埔宏福苑火警引起社會對樓宇消防安全的廣泛關注。鑑於聖誕假期將至，消防處昨日（十二月二十三日）起一連兩日，針對全港有較高火警風險的商業大廈展開特別消防安全巡查與執法行動，以確保公眾安全。

就持牌處所（如食肆等）的消防安全監管，消防處會向牌照申請人列明相關安全規定並作出檢測，確保有關處所達到相應的消防安全水平。然而，若因大廈及相關處所管理不善，便會構成潛在的火警危險，例如防煙門被楔開、逃生途徑被阻塞、鎖上或放置易燃物品，以及消防裝置或設備不在有效操作狀態等。此外，如商業大廈內設有大量持牌處所，由於這些場所人流密集，潛在的火警風險往往較一般大廈高。

由於預期聖誕假期時，設有較多持牌處所的商業大廈的人流將顯著上升，消防處在全港揀選共132幢此類商業大廈，展開特別消防安全巡查與執法行動，就各類火警危險共發出376張「消除火警危險通知書」，並提出53宗檢控。而就其中57幢懷疑未有為大廈消防裝置或設備進行年檢的商業大廈，消防處已嚴肅跟進，並會就違規情況採取執法行動。

行動期間，消防人員除進行巡查與執法外，亦同步推行防火宣傳及教育，以提升業戶與公眾的消防安全意識，從源頭減少火警發生機會。

為進一步加強監管此類商業大廈的消防安全，以及提升業戶及公眾的消防安全意識，消防處將與物業管理業監管局、香港物業管理公司協會有限公司及其他相關持份者加強溝通，以引入具針對性的監管與宣傳措施。相關協作旨在強化政府與業界的協作機制，確保大廈內消防設施維持良好運作狀態，同時鼓勵業主、租戶及物業管理方妥善做好大廈管理，避免出現火警危險。

消防處期望透過資源整合與資訊互通，各方攜手推動消防安全文化，共同營造更安全、更可靠的社區環境。"
CHP investigates imported measles case epidemiologically linked to earlier case,2025-12-24 20:09,2025-12-24 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400697.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (December 24) is investigating an imported measles case. The patient is the mother of the imported measles case announced yesterday (December 23). The CHP reminded members of the public who are non-immune to measles to ensure that they have completed two doses of measles vaccination before travelling to reduce the risk of infection.

The latest case involves a 22-year-old woman who developed fever on December 18 with no other symptoms and did not seek medical attention. As her son tested positive for the measles virus upon nucleic acid testing, the CHP found that the female patient developed symptoms during contact tracing and epidemiological investigation. She was then arranged to admit to hospital for testing. Her clinical specimen was tested positive for the measles virus upon nucleic acid testing. She is isolated for treatment at the Princess Margaret Hospital and is currently in stable condition.

The female patient stayed outside Hong Kong from October 1 to December 16. As she spent the whole incubation period outside Hong Kong, the case was classified as an imported case. An epidemiological investigation revealed that the female patient did not receive measles vaccination.

As the abovementioned two epidemiologically linked patients have visited a private clinic on December 19, the CHP has reached contacts who visited the private clinic during the same period on December 19, to identify if high risk persons were involved, and assessed if they had immunity against measles and arranged vaccinations for contacts who are non-immune. So far there are no pregnant women, persons with weakened immunity and infants under one year old among the contacts. The contacts did not present measles symptoms. The CHP will continue to put the relevant contacts under medical surveillance. Management of relevant private clinic was requested to report to the CHP if any persons develop measles symptoms for follow up.

The CHP's investigation is ongoing.

""Measles remain as an endemic infection in many places around the world. The number of measles cases in some overseas countries has been increasing recently. The outbreaks in North America (including the United States and Canada), Europe and Southeast Asia areas (including Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines) are ongoing due to the relatively low vaccination rate. Furthermore, an increasing number of measles cases have also been recorded in Japan and Australia this year. Overseas cases mainly affected people who were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. This shows the importance of maintaining a high vaccination rate and herd immunity within the community. For those who plan to travel to areas with measles transmission, they should check their vaccination records and medical history as early as possible. If they have not been diagnosed with measles through laboratory tests and have never received two doses of measles vaccine or are not sure if they have received a measles vaccine, they should consult a doctor at least two weeks prior to their trip for vaccination. Pregnant women and women preparing for pregnancy who are non-immune to measles as well as children aged under one year who are not due for the first dose of Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) combined vaccine under theHong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme, are advised not to travel to places with outbreaks of measles,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""The incubation period of measles (i.e. the time from infection to onset of illness) is seven to 21 days. Symptoms include fever, skin rash, cough, runny nose and red eyes. If travellers returning from places with high incidence or outbreak of measles develop symptoms of measles (e.g. fever and rash), they should seek medical advice immediately and avoid contact with non-immune persons, especially pregnant women and infants under one year old. They should also report their symptoms and prior travel history to the healthcare workers so that appropriate infection control measures can be implemented at the healthcare facilities to prevent any potential spread,"" Dr Tsui added.

 ""Under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme, the overall immunisation coverage in Hong Kong has been maintained at a very high level through the immunisation services provided by the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres and School Immunisation Teams. As evidenced by the findings on vaccination coverage of primary school students and the territory-wide immunisation surveys conducted regularly by the DH, the two-dose measles vaccination coverage has remained consistently high, well above 95 per cent, and the local seroprevalence rates of measles virus antibodies reflect that most people in Hong Kong are immune to measles. However, Hong Kong, as a city with a high volume of international travel, still faces the potential risk of importation of the measles virus and its further spread in the local community. Hence, a small number of people who have not completed a measles vaccination (such as non-local-born people including new immigrants, foreign domestic helpers, overseas employees and people coming to Hong Kong for further studies) are still at risk of being infected and spreading measles to other people who do not have immunity against measles, such as children under 1 year old who have not yet received the first dose of the measles vaccine,"" he continued.

 People born before 1967 could be considered to have acquired immunity to measles through natural infection, as measles was endemic in many parts of the world and in Hong Kong at that time. People born in or after 1967 who have not yet completed the two doses of measles vaccination or whose measles vaccination history is unknown, should consult their family doctors as soon as possible to complete the vaccination and ensure adequate protection against measles.

 Besides being vaccinated against measles, members of the public should take the following measures to prevent infection:


Maintain good personal and environmental hygiene;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
Keep hands clean and wash hands properly;
Wash hands when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;
Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and mouth discharge properly;
Clean used toys and furniture properly; and
Persons with measles should be kept out of school till four days from the appearance of a rash to prevent the spread of the infection to non-immune persons in school.

衞生防護中心公布一宗與早前個案有流行病學關連的外地傳入麻疹個案,2025-12-24 19:55,2025-12-24 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400662.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月二十四日）正調查一宗由外地傳入的麻疹個案，病人是昨日（十二月二十三日）公布一宗外地傳入個案的母親。中心提醒對麻疹未具備免疫力的市民外遊前應確保完成接種兩劑麻疹疫苗，以減低受感染風險。

最新個案涉及一名二十二歲女病人，自十二月十八日起出現發燒，但沒有其他病徵，她亦沒有求診。由於其子經檢測後證實對麻疹病毒核酸檢測呈陽性反應，中心在進行個案追蹤和流行病學調查時發現女病人出現病徵，遂安排她入院進行檢測。她的臨床樣本經檢測後證實亦對麻疹病毒核酸檢測呈陽性反應，正在瑪嘉烈醫院接受隔離治療，現時情況穩定。

女病人於十月一日至十二月十六日逗留在外地，整個潛伏期都不在香港，故被列為外地輸入個案。流行病學調查顯示，女病人不曾接種麻疹疫苗。

由於上述兩名有流行病學關連的病人曾於十二月十九日到過一間私家診所，中心已聯絡曾在十二月十九日同一時段到訪該私家診所的接觸者，以找出是否涉及高危人士，並評估他們對麻疹是否具備免疫力，及安排未具備免疫力的接觸者接種麻疹疫苗，暫時沒有發現接觸者中有孕婦、免疫力弱或一歲以下嬰兒，亦沒有接觸者出現麻疹病徵。中心會繼續對相關接觸者進行醫學監察，並要求相關私家診所負責人如發現出現麻疹病徵的人士，應向中心報告，以便中心跟進。

中心的調查仍然繼續。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「麻疹在全球多個地方一直為風土病。近期部分海外國家的麻疹個案呈上升趨勢，其中北美洲（包括美國及加拿大）、歐洲及東南亞地區（包括越南、柬埔寨和菲律賓），因疫苗覆蓋接種率偏低而出現麻疹持續爆發。另外，日本和澳洲今年錄得的麻疹個案亦有所上升。海外大部分個案未曾接種麻疹疫苗或疫苗接種史不詳，反映了維持整體高疫苗接種率及群體免疫力的重要性。因此，計劃前往麻疹流行地區的市民，應及早檢視自己的疫苗接種紀錄及病歷，若以往未經化驗確診感染麻疹，以及從未或不確定曾否接種兩劑麻疹疫苗，應在出發前最少兩星期諮詢醫生接種疫苗。對麻疹沒有免疫力的懷孕婦女及計劃懷孕婦女，以及仍未適齡在『香港兒童免疫接種計劃』下接種麻疹、流行性腮腺炎及德國麻疹混合疫苗的未滿一歲的兒童，不應前往出現麻疹爆發的地區。」

徐樂堅醫生補充：「麻疹的潛伏期（即由感染後到發病的時間）為七至21日。麻疹病徵包括發燒、皮膚出現紅疹、咳嗽、流鼻水和眼紅等。由麻疹高發病率或出現麻疹爆發的地區回港的旅遊人士如出現麻疹病徵（例如發燒、紅疹等），應立即求醫，並避免接觸對麻疹未有免疫力的人士（尤其是孕婦和未滿一歲的嬰兒）。他們亦應在求診前預先知會醫護人員有關的病徵及旅遊史，以便醫療機構安排適當的感染控制措施，防止可能出現的傳播。」

他續說：「在『香港兒童免疫接種計劃』下，透過衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院及學童免疫注射小組提供的免疫接種服務，本港整體免疫接種覆蓋率一直維持在非常高水平。根據小學學童的免疫接種覆蓋率及衞生署定期進行全港免疫接種覆蓋調查顯示，兩劑麻疹疫苗接種的整體覆蓋率一直維持在95%以上，而本地麻疹病毒抗體的血清陽性率反映絕大部分香港市民對麻疹已有免疫力。然而，香港作為國際旅遊頻繁的城市，仍面對輸入麻疹病毒及其在本地社區進一步傳播的潛在風險。少數未完成接種麻疹疫苗的人士（例如非本地出生人士，包括新移民、外傭、海外僱員及來港升學人士）仍有機會受感染，並把麻疹傳播給其他未具備麻疹免疫力人士，例如一歲以下尚未接種第一劑麻疹疫苗的幼兒。」

在一九六七年前出生的市民，由於當時麻疹在全球多個地方及香港仍屬風土病，故可視為透過自然感染而對麻疹具備免疫力。一九六七年或以後出生而尚未完成接種兩劑麻疹疫苗或對麻疹疫苗接種史不詳的人士，應盡快諮詢家庭醫生以完成接種，以確保市民對麻疹有足夠保護力。

除接種麻疹疫苗外，市民應採取以下措施預防感染麻疹：

• 維持良好的個人及環境衞生；
•保持室內空氣流通；
•保持雙手清潔，並用正確的方法洗手；
•雙手被呼吸系統分泌物弄污後（如打噴嚏後）應立即洗手；
•打噴嚏或咳嗽時要掩着口鼻，並妥善清理口鼻排出的分泌物；
•徹底清潔用過的玩具和家具；及
•病患者在出疹後的四日內不應上學，避免將疾病傳染給未有免疫力的人。

Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-24 19:40,2025-12-24 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400677.htm," The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

 For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3.8 billion as of noon today (December 24). With the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $4.1 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

 The Government provides a $100,000 living allowance from the Support Fund to each affected household, while families of each deceased victim are provided with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. All verified cases have been processed so far. In addition, the Government earlier announced three new measures, providing flat owners at Wang Fuk Court with a grant of $100,000; an annual rental grant of $150,000 (to be provided for two years) and a one-off relocation grant of $50,000; as well as a one-off relocation grant of $50,000 for affected tenants. The allowances will be disbursed in phases.

 Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 980 affected households, and more than 4 900 residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

  Currently, there is still a supply of more than 1 000 units that can provide affected residents with longer-term accommodation. The transitional housing and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) projects in different districts can altogether provide around 500 units at the moment. Moreover, Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun and Runway 1331 at Kai Tak can provide a supply of around 900 units.

 As of this morning, a total of 490 residents are staying in hotel rooms through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, and 551 residents are staying in youth hostels/camps. Another 3 590 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau, units from the HKHS, or Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

 The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 2 000 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, over 51 000 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Investigation and regulation
-------------------------------

  Relevant policy bureaux and departments continue to follow up on the fire investigation and regulatory efforts."
節日假期健康「攻略」,2025-12-24 18:05,2025-12-24 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400599.htm,"聖誕節和新年假期臨近，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月二十四日）提醒市民要注意自己的身體狀況，避免攝取過多酒精、鹽分、糖分和油脂，保持充足的休息和睡眠，以免影響免疫系統正常運作，容易生病。此外，不論是留港或到外地歡度節日亦要時刻注意個人、食物及環境衞生，及早接種季節性流感疫苗，以預防各種在冬季較常見或與旅遊相關的傳染病。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「市民與親朋好友共聚時容易在不知不覺間攝取過多酒精或高糖飲料、蛋糕甜品、香脆小食（例如薯片和煎炸食物）等。另外，天文台預料未來兩天氣溫下降，不少人可能會享用火鍋，進餐時亦會添加不少高脂高鹽的調味料。我提醒市民在節日氛圍下，要注意控制飲食的分量，盡可能選擇高纖低脂食物（多蔬果、以蒸煮代替煎炸的烹調方式）、減少高糖高鹽飲品及糕點，並注意食物衞生，同時配合適量運動和休息，才能歡度佳節同時保持健康。」

遠離酒精
－－－－
世界衞生組織轄下的國際癌症研究機構已將酒精列為第一類致癌物，與吸煙及石棉等同屬最高風險類別。酒精會引致多種癌症，包括口腔癌、咽喉癌、食道癌、肝癌、大腸癌及女性乳癌等，且風險隨飲酒量上升而增加。值得注意的是，所有酒精飲品，不論啤酒、葡萄酒或烈酒，均具致癌風險。

徐樂堅醫生提醒：「酒精可以致癌，並無安全攝取量，即使少量飲酒亦可能危害健康。我們建議市民以無酒精方式慶祝佳節。飲酒人士務必節制分量，避免一次過攝入過量酒精（指一次過飲用相當於五罐啤酒或五杯烈酒），以免增加酒精中毒、意外受傷、牽涉道路交通意外及進行不安全性行為等風險。同時，酒精熱量高，每克含七千卡路里，容易導致體重上升。佳節當前，我們鼓勵大家以健康飲食、戶外活動或與親友共聚等活動取代飲酒，迎接更充實的新一年。」

衞生署「活出健康新方向」網站內設有電子飲酒篩查及簡要介入（e-SBI）工具(www.change4health.gov.hk/tc/audit)，方便市民評估自己的飲酒風險並獲取個人化健康建議。若評估顯示飲酒風險偏高或可能出現依賴，應及早尋求專業協助。

精明飲食
－－－－
無論在家中或外出慶祝，市民都應緊守均衡飲食和「三低一高」（即低脂肪、低鈉（鹽）、低糖和高膳食纖維）的原則。此外，市民應留意用餐時的進食次序，宜先進食蔬菜，以增飽腹感。市民每日應最少進食三份蔬菜，而一份蔬菜約等於一碗沙律菜。沙律如需調味，宜選醋或少許橄欖油。另外，可選以烤焗、蒸煮等方法烹調的低脂肉類菜式，例如去皮火雞肉、魚柳等，並避免進食加工肉類，例如凍肉拼盤。最後應避免選擇一些高脂、高糖的甜品，例如芝士蛋糕。市民可選擇以新鮮水果作甜品。如外出用餐，可光顧「星級有營食肆」，並選擇「蔬果之選」和「3少之選」的菜式。

小食方面，市民可選擇一些較健康的類別，例如焗薯片、焗番薯片、粟米片、原味果仁（無添加鹽）及低脂爆谷，並控制小食的分量，或以水果作小食，以達到每日最少兩份水果的目標。避免進食大量肥膩和糖分高的小食（例如薯片、蝦條、牛油爆谷和朱古力）。選擇無糖或低糖飲品，以取代酒精和高糖飲品。多喝清水或於家中可自製一些低熱量又美味的飲品（例如青檸混入梳打水）。

保持適量運動和休息
－－－－－－－－－
衞生署鼓勵市民於節日期間不忘照顧身心，透過運動與休息的平衡，享受真正健康愉快的長假期。世界衞生組織建議成年人應每星期進行最少150–300分鐘中等強度的帶氧體能活動，例如快步行和踏單車；或最少75–150分鐘劇烈強度的帶氧體能活動，如跑步和跳繩。運動不單有助消耗節日攝取的額外卡路里，還可以幫助減低患上非傳染病的風險和改善精神健康。

徐樂堅醫生說：「步行是一項簡單易行的體能活動，適合一家大小共同參與。步行不僅能改善心肺功能、強化肌肉和鞏固骨骼，更有助預防肥胖、高血壓和糖尿病。節日期間，不妨與親友一同到戶外步行，既可舒展身心，也能讓健康習慣融入歡樂時光。市民可選擇居所附近、海濱長廊、公園或郊野健步行徑，輕鬆開展步行之旅。」

預防傳染病
－－－－－
徐樂堅醫生續說：「本港整體流感活躍程度現時仍維持在高水平，而北半球大部分地區（包括美國、加拿大、英國、歐洲、韓國、日本及中國內地）的流感活躍程度亦持續增加或已處於高水平。接種季節性流感疫苗仍然是最有效預防季節性流感及其併發症的方法，亦可減低入院及死亡風險。市民無論在本地或計劃外遊，應及早接種疫苗。另外，在北美和歐洲多處地區呼吸道合胞病毒的活躍程度開始上升。預防呼吸道合胞病毒感染與其他呼吸道疾病的方法一樣，市民應時刻保持個人、手部和環境衞生。

節日聚會時，更要特別留意個人衞生和採取預防措施。觸摸口鼻眼前後、觸摸扶手或門把等公共設施後、咳嗽或打噴嚏後都應徹底清潔雙手。當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，諾如病毒在冬天（約十二月至三月期間）較為活躍。由於病毒具高度傳染性，受影響人士即使接觸少量病毒，亦有機會受感染。要預防急性腸胃炎及諾如病毒感染，必須經常保持雙手清潔，尤其在處理食物或進食前及如廁後。洗手時應以梘液和清水清潔雙手，搓手最少20秒，用水過清並用抹手紙或乾手機弄乾。由於酒精未能有效殺死諾如病毒，酒精搓手液不能代替使用梘液和清水潔手。節慶期間，市民較多機會舉行派對安排食物到會或火鍋，要預防食物中毒，所有食物亦必須徹底清潔並煮熟後方可食用；處理貝類海產時，須洗淨外殼並去除內臟，才可進食。此外，切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬，並應使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。有關食物安全的更多資訊，可瀏覽食物環境衞生署食物安全中心網頁。

雖然北半球已進入冬季，但亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。要預防蚊傳疾病，市民應穿着寬鬆、淺色的長袖上衣及長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。如從受影響地區返港，應在至少14日內繼續使用昆蟲驅避劑。

進一步詳情請參與中心最近的新聞稿和衞生署旅遊健康服務網頁，以了解目的地的公共衞生情況和應接種的疫苗或預防措施等。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-24 18:05,2025-12-24 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400595.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 24), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10 of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

  
  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Hong Kong Customs combats counterfeit goods activities and seizes suspected counterfeit goods worth over $36 million ahead of Christmas (with photo),2025-12-24 17:23,2025-12-24 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400547.htm,"âHong Kong Customs conducted a two-week enforcement operation codenamed ""Santa Guardian"" from December 8 to 19 to combat counterfeit goods activities involving cross-boundary transshipments with the approach of Christmas. During the operation, Customs detected 28 related cases and seized about 83 000 suspected counterfeit goods with an estimated market value of over $36 million.

Customs discovered that criminals intended to ship counterfeit goods abroad via Hong Kong to meet the huge shopping demand with the approach of Christmas. As such, through risk assessment, Customs inspected one incoming lorry at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port Inbound Cargo Examination Building. After inspection, Customs officers seized about 3 600 suspected counterfeit goods with an estimated market value of about $3.1 million.

Moreover, through intelligence analysis and detailed investigations, 27 related cases were uncovered in a number of local logistics companies. In the operation, Customs officers mounted strike-and-search actions against multiple logistics companies, seizing about 79 000 suspected counterfeit goods, including watches, bags, footwear and clothing, with a total estimated market value of about $33 million.

Investigations of the abovementioned cases are ongoing.

Customs appeals to consumers to purchase goods at reputable shops or websites and to check with the trademark or copyright owners or authorised agents if the authenticity of a product is in doubt to avoid buying counterfeit or infringing goods.

Customs reminds practitioners in the logistics industry to comply with the requirements of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (TDO) and to check with the trademark owners or authorised agents if the authenticity of a product is in doubt when handling cargoes. The department also reminds traders or online sellers not to sell counterfeit or infringing goods and to be cautious and prudent in merchandising since selling counterfeit or infringing goods is a serious crime and offenders are liable to criminal sanctions.

Customs will continue to step up inspections and conduct intelligence-led enforcement to vigorously combat different types of counterfeit and infringing goods activities.

Under the TDO, any person who imports or exports or sells or possesses for sale any goods to which a forged trademark is applied commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

十二月份第四批涵蓋五個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及20個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下，大部分地區更為0%，顯示白紋伊蚊的分布情況並不廣泛。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十二月共四批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共55個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年十一月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這55個監察區中，52個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有三區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Among the fourth batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering five survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering 20 survey areas in December, all were below 10 per cent, and most of the areas recorded zero per cent, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive.

The FEHD has so far released four batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in December 2025, covering 55 survey areas. Among these 55 survey areas, 52 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. November 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Three other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。」

​發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

Nine persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photos),2025-12-24 16:58,2025-12-24 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400526.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations, including joint operations with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Champion"", from December 21 to yesterday (December 23). During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers raided multiple target locations, including food markets and performance and event venues. Six suspected illegal workers, one suspected employer and two overstayers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised three men and three women, aged 18 to 58. A woman aged 43 was suspected of employing the illegal workers and was also arrested.

  The investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  Additionally, alongside enforcement actions, ImmD officers, along with a publicity vehicle, were deployed to a newly inhabited housing estate in Sheung Shui. They distributed leaflets to residents handling move-in procedures and the property management staff. The officers urged residents to stand against employing illegal workers and reminded them that customers who knowingly engage service providers using illegal labour may also be subject to criminal liability.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. ""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."
按應計制編製的二○二四至二五年度政府綜合帳目,2025-12-24 16:30,2025-12-24 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122300442.htm,"政府今日（十二月二十四日）公布按應計制編製的二○二四至二五財政年度綜合帳目。

政府發言人表示，應計制帳目與現金收付制帳目各有不同的匯報目的。他說：「現金收付制帳目以財政年度內實際現金收入與開支作為編製基礎，主要顯示公帑支出是在立法會批准的金額及範圍內，而應計制帳目則旨在展示更多關於政府財務表現及狀況的資料。」

「現金收付制帳目綜合匯報政府一般收入帳目及根據《公共財政條例》（第2章）第29條設立的各項基金（債券基金除外，其結餘不屬財政儲備的一部分）。應計制帳目除包括現金收付制帳目綜合匯報的政府一般收入帳目及基金外，亦涵蓋外匯基金、香港房屋委員會（房委會）、政府企業（例如香港鐵路有限公司及九廣鐵路公司），以及其他政府基金（例如債券基金及優質教育基金）。此外，應計制帳目更全面披露政府資產及負債，例如固定資產、退休金準備及政府債項。」

應計制帳目與現金收付制帳目的一些重要數字並列如下：

按應計制編製的綜合財務表現表錄得141億港元虧損，現金收付制帳目則錄得803億港元赤字。這主要是由於前者計及外匯基金、房委會和其他基金的盈餘。

按應計制編製的綜合財務狀況表顯示，截至二○二五年三月三十一日，政府的資產淨值為16,362億港元，當中包括三項儲備：一般儲備（1,715億港元）、外匯基金儲備（7,805億港元）及資本開支儲備（6,842億港元）。儘管如此，政府可動用的現金資源仍然是財政儲備。截至二○二五年三月三十一日，政府的財政儲備為6,543億港元。

發言人解釋：「一般儲備即政府的財務資產淨值。外匯基金儲備是指外匯基金的資產淨值，其用途受《外匯基金條例》（第66章）規管。至於資本開支儲備，是指固定資產的帳面淨值總額。」

「截至二○二五年三月三十一日，政府的一般儲備為1,715億港元，較現金收付制帳目所示的6,543億港元財政儲備少4,828億港元；有此差異，原因是應計制帳目所示的政府財務資產淨值計及政府的負債，例如已發行的政府債券、公務員的退休金準備及員工尚餘假期準備，而部分負債被政府在香港鐵路有限公司及機場管理局的投資等財務資產抵銷。」

「總值4,835億港元的政府債券，是指根據政府可持續債券計劃、基礎建設債券計劃及政府債券計劃發行的債務工具。現值9,248億港元的退休金準備，是指政府依法給予公務員退休金而承擔的負債。」

「除在按應計制編製的綜合財務狀況表中顯示的政府負債外，應計制帳目亦披露政府的12,486億港元承擔餘額（主要涉及基本工程），以及政府對多項計劃所作的3,147億港元保證。」

​政府收到醫委會提交完善投訴處理機制的報告,2025-12-24 16:30,2025-12-24 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400425.htm,"醫務衞生局（醫衞局）今日（十二月二十四日）收到香港醫務委員會（醫委會）關於完善投訴處理機制的報告。

醫衞局局長盧寵茂教授說：「醫護專業奉行專業自主乃建基於社會大眾的信任，醫委會作為規管醫生專業的法定監管機構，獲《醫生註冊條例》（《條例》）賦權處理醫生的註冊和紀律事宜，對維護醫生專業水平和操守負有主體責任。醫委會委員必須積極履行職責，落實其『行公義、守專業、護社羣』的使命，才能維持公眾對醫生專業的信任。」

盧寵茂教授續指：「醫衞局正詳細審視醫委會的報告，並會就報告內容要求醫委會進一步澄清及提供資料，包括醫委會監察各初步偵訊委員會（初偵會）和研訊小組處理投訴個案進度的機制，以及初偵會和研訊小組各自在監督個案進度的角色。 如醫委會就秘書所提供行政支援的工作表現提出意見，衞生署亦會按醫委會的報告內容進行調查，包括是否需要就個別員工展開紀律程序。政府會適時公布下一階段工作。」

醫衞局會因應報告的建議及醫委會的運作需要而提出修訂《條例》，目標在明年上半年向立法會提交條例草案。醫衞局將於下月就修訂《條例》及強化醫委會投訴處理機制開展業界和持份者諮詢工作，與專業團體和病人組織等持份者會面，聆聽他們的意見。"
Government received report from MCHK to improve complaint handling mechanism,2025-12-24 16:30,2025-12-24 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400431.htm,"The Health Bureau received the report from the Medical Council of Hong Kong (MCHK) on improving its complaint handling mechanism today (December 24).

The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""Healthcare professions uphold professional autonomy premised on the trust of members of the public. As the statutory regulatory body of the medical profession, the MCHK is empowered under the Medical Registration Ordinance (MRO) to handle registration and disciplinary matters of medical practitioners and bears the main responsibility to uphold the professional standard and ethical conduct of doctors. Members of the MCHK must actively discharge their duties and fulfil their mission of ensuring justice, maintaining professionalism and protecting the public, to maintain public trust in the medical profession.""

Professor Lo added, ""The Health Bureau is examining the MCHK’s report in detail and will request the MCHK to provide clarifications and further information regarding its content, including the MCHK's monitoring mechanism over the progress of the Preliminary Investigation Committee and Inquiry Panel in handling complaints, as well as their respective roles in monitoring case progress. If the MCHK raises any comment on the performance of its Secretary in providing administrative support, the Department of Health will conduct an investigation based on the content of the MCHK's report, including whether to commence disciplinary proceedings against individual staff members. The Government will announce the next phase of work at an appropriate juncture.""

The Health Bureau will introduce amendments to the MRO in response to the recommendations of the report and based on the operational need of the MCHK, targeting to introduce an amendment bill into the Legislative Council in the first half of next year. The Health Bureau will begin consultation work with the sector and stakeholders next month on amending the MRO and enhancing the MCHK's complaint handling mechanism and will meet with stakeholders such as professional organisations and patient groups to listen to their views."
Accrual-based Consolidated Government Accounts for 2024-25,2025-12-24 16:30,2025-12-24 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122300470.htm,"The Government published today (December 24) its accrual-based consolidated accounts for the financial year 2024-25.

 A government spokesman said that the accrual-based accounts differ from the cash-based ones in the purposes they serve. ""Compiled on the basis of actual cash revenue and expenditure within a financial year, the cash-based accounts serve mainly to demonstrate that public money has been paid within the limits and ambits approved by the legislature. The accrual-based accounts, on the other hand, aim to present more information on the financial performance and position of the Government,"" he said.

 ""The cash-based accounts consolidate the General Revenue Account (GRA) and the Funds established under section 29 of the Public Finance Ordinance (Cap. 2) except the Bond Fund, the balance of which is not part of the Fiscal Reserves. In addition to the GRA and Funds consolidated in the cash-based accounts, the accrual-based accounts include the Exchange Fund, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA), government business enterprises such as the MTR Corporation Limited and the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, and other government funds such as the Bond Fund and the Quality Education Fund. There are also more comprehensive disclosures of the Government's assets and liabilities in the accrual-based accounts, e.g. fixed assets, provision for pensions and government debts.""

 The key figures shown in the accrual-based accounts as compared with those in the cash-based accounts are highlighted below:





2024-25


Cash-based
			(HK$ billion)
Accrual-based
			(HK$ billion)

			• Net deficit

			684.2



--------------

654.3
1,636.2



--------------
--------------


Net assets
654.3
1,636.2




The accrual-based Consolidated Statement of Financial Performance reports a deficit of HK$14.1 billion, whereas the cash-based accounts show a deficit of HK$80.3 billion. This is mainly due to inclusion of the surpluses of the Exchange Fund, the HKHA and other funds.

 According to the accrual-based Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Government's net assets were HK$1,636.2 billion as at March31,2025. These net assets were represented by three reserves: General Reserve of HK$171.5billion, Exchange Fund Reserve of HK$780.5 billion and Capital Expenditure Reserve of HK$684.2 billion. Notwithstanding these, the cash resources available for the Government's spending remain to be the Fiscal Reserves, which stood at HK$654.3 billion as at March 31, 2025.

 ""The General Reserve represents the net financial assets of the Government. The Exchange Fund Reserve refers to the net assets of the Exchange Fund, the use of which is governed by the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66), whereas the Capital Expenditure Reserve represents the total net book value of fixed assets,"" the spokesman added.

 ""The Government's General Reserve as at March31,2025, was HK$171.5billion, HK$482.8billion less than the Fiscal Reserves of HK$654.3billion reported in the cash-based accounts. The difference arises because the net financial assets of the Government in the accrual-based accounts take into account the Government's liabilities such as government bonds, pensions and untaken leave of staff, partly offset by financial assets such as investments in the MTR Corporation Limited and the Airport Authority.

 ""Totalling HK$483.5billion, the government bonds refer to the debt instruments issued under the Government Sustainable Bond Programme, Infrastructure Bond Programme and Government Bond Programme. The provision for pensions of HK$924.8 billion, in terms of present value, represents the statutory liabilities in relation to civil servants' pensions.

 ""Apart from the liabilities shown in the accrual-based Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, there are also outstanding commitments, largely for capital works, of HK$1,248.6billion and guarantees of HK$314.7billion provided under various schemes.""

Grading of beach water quality released,2025-12-24 16:00,2025-12-24 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400489.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (December 24) released the latest grading of water quality for six gazetted beaches that are open all year round for swimming.

  Four beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1), and two as Fair (Grade 2).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Golden Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Silverstrand Beach




Grade 2 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Lido Beach




  Compared with the grading released last week, there was no change in the grading for these beaches.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast)."

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on December 23 to noon today (December 24), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 281 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit.

Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 191 264 samples of food imported from Japan (including 123 569 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 42 366 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

牌照處發言人表示：「牌照處在行動中突擊巡查了48個處所，當中有六個處所涉嫌無牌經營酒店或賓館，及兩間持牌會社涉嫌違反發牌條件。如在完成調查後有足夠證據，牌照處會作出檢控。」

發言人強調：「無牌經營酒店或賓館屬刑事罪行，根據《旅館業條例》，一經定罪會留有案底，最高刑罰為監禁三年及罰款500,000元，就罪行持續期間的每一日亦可被另處罰款20,000元。針對涉及重犯罪行的無牌經營酒店／賓館，法庭亦可就有關處所發出為期六個月的封閉令。另外，根據《會社（房產安全）條例》，凡持牌會社違反合格證明書的任何條件（例如：未能按要求出示消防裝置及設備證書和未經批准進行改動及加建工程等），一經定罪可處罰款100,000元及監禁兩年，並可就罪行持續期間的每一天另處罰款10,000元。」

Office of Licensing Authority of Home Affairs Department stepped up enforcement actions against unlicensed hotels/guesthouses and illegal club-house operations before festive season (with photo),2025-12-24 15:00,2025-12-24 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400288.htm,"âBefore the festive season holidays, the Office of the Licensing Authority (OLA) of the Home Affairs Department conducted an operation codenamed ""Solar Flare"" against premises suspected of operating unlicensed hotels or guesthouses and licensed club-houses suspected of being in breach of licensing conditions in Yau Tsim Mong District, Wan Chai District and Central and Western District for five consecutive days from December 15 to 19, to ensure the safety of customers as well as the general public.

A spokesman for the OLA said, ""During the operation, the OLA carried out surprise inspections of 48 premises. Six premises were suspected of operating unlicensed hotels or guesthouses, and two licensed club-houses were suspected of breaching certain licensing conditions. The OLA will initiate prosecution on cases with sufficient evidence after completion of the investigation.""

The spokesman stressed, ""Operating unlicensed hotels or guesthouses is a criminal offence leading to a criminal record upon conviction. According to the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance, an offender is liable to three years' imprisonment and a maximum fine of $500,000. A fine of $20,000 for each day can also be imposed during which the offence continues. A six-month closure order may also be issued for a hotel/guesthouse involved in a repeated offence. Moreover, according to the Clubs (Safety of Premises) Ordinance, an offender who contravenes any condition of a certificate of compliance (e.g. failure to produce a fire certificate on demand and carrying out alteration and addition works without seeking prior approval) is liable to a maximum fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment. A fine of $10,000 for each day can also be imposed during which the offence continues.""

  To enhance deterrence against unlicensed hotels and guesthouses, the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance was amended in 2020 to empower the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Authority to apply to the court, upon the second conviction within 16 months of operating an unlicensed hotel or guesthouse or the new strict liability offence in respect of the same premises, to issue a closure order to close the premises for six months. As at December 15, the OLA has applied for four closure orders under the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance from the court, of which two closure orders against two premises have been issued by the court.

  Apart from conducting special operations during festive seasons, the OLA is also stepping up efforts to combat unlicensed guesthouses via online platforms. The OLA has strengthened its intelligence collection by forming a dedicated team to browse webpages, mobile applications, social media, discussion forums, etc., to search for information and intelligence on suspected unlicensed guesthouses. The OLA's law enforcement officers will initiate follow-up investigations when information on unlicensed guesthousesadvertised via online platforms is found. The OLA also conducts publicity work on major Internet search engines outside Hong Kong toenable tourists to access information provided by the OLA in the course of planning their trips to Hong Kong.

Tourists and members of the public can make use of the search functions on the OLA's website (www.hadla.gov.hk/) to check whether the hotel or guesthouse concerned is licensed or not. Any suspected unlicensed hotel or guesthouse should be reported to the OLA by the hotline (tel: 2881 7498), by email (hadlaenq@had.gov.hk), by fax (2504 5805), or through the mobile application ""Hong Kong Licensed Hotels and Guesthouses""."
財庫局和證監會就規管虛擬資產交易及託管服務的立法建議發表諮詢總結,2025-12-24 14:45,2025-12-24 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400262.htm,"財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）和證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）今日（十二月二十四日）就設立虛擬資產交易及託管服務提供者發牌制度的立法建議，聯合發表諮詢總結。財庫局及證監會今日同時就另外設立就虛擬資產提供意見的服務提供者及虛擬資產管理服務提供者的發牌制度，展開進一步公眾諮詢，為期一個月。

為期兩個月的公眾諮詢在今年八月完成，其間就虛擬資產交易服務提供者和虛擬資產託管服務提供者的擬議發牌制度分別收到101份和93份意見書，來自市場參與者、行業組織、商會和專業團體等。大部分回應者均明確表示，支持在虛擬資產交易平台發牌制度於二○二三年六月實施後擴展監管範圍，將虛擬資產交易和託管服務納入其中。他們認為這是促進香港數字資產（註）生態圈穩健及可持續發展的關鍵一步。此外，回應者普遍支持擬議的監管要求及實施安排的整體方向，同時在某些方面提出優化建議及尋求釐清。

擬議的虛擬資產交易服務提供者發牌制度，將與《證券及期貨條例》（第571章）下適用於傳統證券交易活動的第1類（證券交易）受規管活動的制度基本一致。至於就虛擬資產託管服務提供者，擬議的發牌制度將會聚焦於管理與在香港保管客戶虛擬資產私鑰相關的風險，以應對虛擬資產託管的核心風險，加強客戶資產安全。

財庫局局長許正宇表示：「我們提出就虛擬資產交易和託管服務提供者建立發牌制度是完善數字資產法律框架的重要一步。建議的發牌制度在促進巿場發展、管理風險及保障投資者之間穩慎地取得平衡，有助實現我們構建值得信賴及可持續數字資產生態圈的願景，從而打造香港為數字資產創新的全球中心。」

證監會行政總裁梁鳳儀表示：「我們在建立虛擬資產監管框架方面可謂取得重大進展，透過構建可信、具競爭力及可持續的生態圈，確保香港在數字資產市場發展中繼續處於全球領先地位。而我們對負責任創新抱有堅定不移的承諾，正為一個活力和韌性兼備的生態圈奠下基礎，對香港金融市場及整體經濟的長遠發展將大有裨益。」

與此同時，因應諮詢所得的意見，財庫局與證監會今日就另外設立就虛擬資產提供意見的服務提供者及虛擬資產管理服務提供者的發牌制度展開進一步公眾諮詢。原先建議將相關虛擬資產活動納入虛擬資產交易服務提供者的發牌制度之下。經修訂的監管方案將有別於原先的建議，而是以傳統證券市場上同類服務的監管制度為藍本，將能為市場參與者釐清不同虛擬資產發牌制度下受監管活動的涵蓋範圍。進一步諮詢為期一個月，至二○二六年一月二十三日為止。

財庫局和證監會歡迎公眾就擬議的就虛擬資產提供意見的服務提供者及虛擬資產管理服務提供者發牌制度提供意見，並透過郵遞（香港添馬添美道2號政府總部24樓）或電郵（vadealing-consult@fstb.gov.hk）方式將意見送交財庫局。

在市場廣泛支持下，並在考慮進一步諮詢所收集到的意見後，財庫局和證監會將敲定發牌制度的立法建議，目標於二○二六年向立法會提交相關條例草案。

FSTB and SFC publish consultation conclusions on legislative proposals for regulating virtual asset dealing and custodian services,2025-12-24 14:45,2025-12-24 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400265.htm,"The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today (December 24) jointly published the consultation conclusions on the legislative proposals for establishing licensing regimes for virtual asset (VA) dealing and custodian service providers. The FSTB and the SFC also launched a further public consultation today for one month on establishing separate licensing regimes for VA advisory and management service providers.

During the two-month public consultation period completed this August, 101 and 93 submissions were received on the proposed licensing regimes for VA dealing service providers and VA custodian service providers respectively. The majority of respondents, including market participants, industry associations, business and professional organisations, expressed clear support for expanding the regulatory scope to cover VA dealing and custodian services, following the introduction of the licensing regime for the VA trading platform in June 2023. This is considered a critical step to promote the steady and sustainable development of the digital asset (Note) ecosystem in Hong Kong. The respondents also indicated support for the overall direction of the proposed regulatory requirements and implementation arrangements, while suggesting enhancements and seeking clarifications on certain aspects.

The proposed licensing regime for VA dealing service providers will largely align with that for Type 1 (dealing in securities) regulated activity under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571) as applicable to conventional securities dealing activities. As for VA custodian service providers, the proposed licensing regime will focus on managing risks relating to safekeeping private keys of client VAs in Hong Kong, which is the core risk area of VA custody, with a view to enhancing the security of client assets.

The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said, ""The proposed establishment of licensing regimes for VA dealing and custodian service providers marks a significant step in enhancing our legal framework for digital assets. The proposed licensing regimes strike a prudent balance among fostering market development, managing risks and protecting investors. They will help realise our vision for building a trusted and sustainable digital asset ecosystem, with a view to establishing Hong Kong as a global hub for digital asset innovation.""

The Chief Executive Officer of the SFC, Ms Julia Leung, said, ""The significant progress in our VA regulatory framework ensures Hong Kong remains at the global forefront of digital asset market developments by fostering a trusted, competitive and sustainable ecosystem. With an unwavering commitment to responsible innovation, we are laying the foundation for a vibrant yet resilient ecosystem that may bring vast benefits to Hong Kong's financial markets and the broader economy in the long run.""

Meanwhile, in response to the feedback received, the FSTB and the SFC also launched a further publicconsultation today on establishing separate licensing regimes for VA advisory and management service providers, instead of covering the relevant VA activities under the licensing regime for VA dealing service providers as originally proposed. This revised regulatory approach will model itself on the regulatory framework applicable to the conventional securities market, and will provide better clarity as regards the scope of activities regulated under different VA licensing regimes. The further consultation will last for one month, ending on January 23, 2026.

The FSTB and the SFC welcome views from the public on the proposed licensing regimes for VA advisory and management service providers. Submissions should be sent by post (24/F, Central Government Offices, 2 Tim Mei Avenue, Tamar, Hong Kong) or by email (vadealing-consult@fstb.gov.hk) to the FSTB.

Details of the consultation conclusions, as well as the further public consultation for licensing regimes for VA advisory and management service providers, are available on the webpages of the FSTB and the SFC:

*Consultation Conclusions on Legislative Proposal to Regulate Dealing in VA and Further Public Consultation on Legislative Proposal to Regulate VA Advisory Service Providers and VA Management Service Providers (www.fstb.gov.hk/fsb/en/publication/consult/doc/VAdealing_consultation_conclusion_e.pdf /apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/consultation/conclusion?refNo=25CP6)

With broad market support, and taking into account the feedback to be received in the further consultation, the FSTB and the SFC will finalise the legislative proposals for the licensing regimes, with a target of introducing the relevant bill into the Legislative Council in 2026.

批准新城廣播有限公司更改其傳送計劃,2025-12-24 12:00,2025-12-24 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400230.htm,"通訊事務管理局（通訊局）根據新城廣播有限公司（新城電台）的聲音廣播牌照附表第2.1及2.2條，批准新城電台終止使用位於赤柱的補點站（赤柱補點站）以傳送其調頻（FM）（註一）聲音廣播服務，上述改動於二○二五年十二月三十一日起生效。

新城電台的聲音廣播牌照訂明，新城電台目前透過七個主要發射站（註二）提供兩條FM聲音廣播頻道，即新城知訊台及新城財經台，並輔以赤柱補點站，以改善紅山半島的FM接收效果。新城電台表示，由於赤柱補點站所在的處所的租賃協議屆滿，該補點站將於二○二五年十二月三十一日起停止運作。新城電台表示赤柱補點站停止運作後，目前由該補點站作為額外無線電訊號源所覆蓋的地區，可由位於歌賦山和南丫島的兩個主要發射站的訊號所覆蓋。

就批准新城電台的申請，通訊局知悉赤柱補點站並非新城電台向相關地區提供其FM聲音廣播頻道的唯一訊號來源。根據新城電台提交並經通訊局評核的接收測量結果，公眾可透過歌賦山發射站及南丫島發射站收聽新城電台頻道，音質令人滿意。事實上，所有其他聲音廣播機構均利用此兩個發射站，傳送其FM聲音廣播頻道（註三）​至有關地區讓公眾接收，而無需設置補點站設施。基於上述理由，通訊局認為新城電台更改其傳送計劃對公眾影響甚微，並信納新城電台能夠遵守其聲音廣播牌照所載的覆蓋要求。

市民如對新城電台兩條FM聲音廣播頻道的接收事宜有任何查詢，可致電新城電台熱線（電話：3698 8000），或與通訊事務管理局辦公室聯絡（電話：2961 6333）。

註一：在香港，電台廣播機構使用調頻（FM）和調幅（AM）制式提供聲音廣播服務。
註二：七個發射站分別位於歌賦山、九龍坑山、青山、金山、南丫島、筆架山和飛鵝山。
註三：即香港商業廣播有限公司的「雷霆881商業一台」和「叱咤903商業二台」；香港電台的第一台、第二台、第四台，以及轉播中央廣播電視總台粵港澳大灣區之聲的頻道。"

Approval to Metro Broadcast Corporation Limited for its change of transmission plan,2025-12-24 12:00,2025-12-24 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/24/P2025122400215.htm,"  The Communications Authority (CA), pursuant to Conditions 2.1 and 2.2 of the Schedule to the sound broadcasting licence of Metro Broadcast Corporation Limited (Metro), has approved Metro's application to cease using the fill-in station at Stanley (Stanley Fill-in Station) for transmission of its FM (Note 1) sound broadcasting service with effect from December 31, 2025.

 As stipulated under the sound broadcasting licence of Metro, Metro is currently providing two FM sound broadcasting channels, viz. Metro Info and Metro Finance, through seven main transmitting stations(Note 2), supplemented by the Stanley Fill-in Station to improve the FM reception at Red Hill Peninsula. Metro informed that the Stanley Fill-in Station will cease operation with effect from December 31, 2025, due to the expiry of the tenancy agreement for the premises. Metro submitted that the areas currently served by the Stanley Fill-in Station as an additional source of radio signals can be covered by the radio signals from the two main transmitting stations at Mount Gough and Lamma Island, after the Stanley Fill-in Station ceases to operate.

 In approving Metro's application, the CA notes that the Stanley Fill-in Station is not the only source for Metro to provide its FM sound broadcasting channels to the relevant areas. Based on the reception measurements submitted by Metro and assessed by the CA, satisfactory audio quality is available for public reception of Metro Channels through the two principal Mount Gough and Lamma Island Transmitting Stations. In fact, these two transmitting stations have been deployed by all other sound broadcasters for transmitting their FM sound broadcasting channels(Note 3) for public reception in the areas concerned without fill-in station facilities. For the reasons above, the CA considers that the impact of the changes to Metro's transmission plan to the general public should be minimal and is satisfied that Metro will be able to comply with the coverage requirement stipulated under its sound broadcasting licence.

 Members of the public may call Metro's hotline at 3698 8000 or contact the Office of the Communications Authority at 2961 6333 for enquiries about the reception of the two FM sound broadcasting channels of Metro.

Note 1: In Hong Kong, radio broadcasters use frequency modulation (FM) and amplitude modulation (AM) to provide their sound broadcasting services.
Note 2:The seven transmitting stations are located at Mount Gough, Cloudy Hill, Castle Peak, Golden Hill, Lamma Island, Beacon Hill and Kowloon Peak.
Note 3: They are CR 1 and CR 2 of Hong Kong Commercial Broadcasting Company Limited, and Radio Television Hong Kong's Radio 1, Radio 2, Radio 4 and the channel relaying Radio the Greater Bay of the China Media Group."
