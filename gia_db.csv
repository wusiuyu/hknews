Labour sector rallies in full force to support Legislative Council General Election (with photos),2025-11-06 16:43,2025-11-06 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600310.htm,"The Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) and the Labour Department (LD) organised an event titled ""Full Support of Labour Sector for 2025 Legislative Council (LegCo) General Election"" today (November 6) to call on the labour sector to support the 2025 LegCo General Election, and mobilise trade unions and workers to engage fully in the voting to elect responsible, visionary and capable LegCo Members for the labour functional constituency and geographical constituencies.

The event was officiated by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, together with the Permanent Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Ms Alice Lau, and the Commissioner for Labour, Mr Sam Hui. Representatives of trade unions attended the event with keen interest, bearing testimony to the unity and concrete actions of the labour sector on fully supporting the LegCo General Election. There were over 350 participants in the event.

Mr Sun emphasised in his speech that being an important legislative body of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the composition of the LegCo is directly related to the well-being of the labour force. The LegCo of this term has passed a number of labour-related bills, including the Employment and Retirement Schemes Legislation (Offsetting Arrangement) (Amendment) Bill 2022to abolish the Mandatory Provident Fund ""offsetting arrangement"", the Employment (Amendment) Bill 2025 to relax the ""continuous contract"" requirement, and the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill 2025 to better safeguard national security and improve the trade union regulatory regime. He stressed that this election is crucial for implementing the principle of ""patriots administering Hong Kong"" and achieving good governance and effective administration of the HKSAR Government. He called on every trade union which has been registered as a corporate elector and workers who are geographical constituency electors to cast their votes on the polling day.

Ms Lau appealed to members of the workforce to actively engage in this election and to thoroughly understand and carefully assess the candidates' comprehension of labour affairs, the feasibility of their political platforms, and their determination and capability to promote policy implementation. She said that voting is not only an exercise of personal choice but also vital participation in shaping the future of Hong Kong. It is both a civic right and a civic responsibility.

Mr Hui also encouraged workers to take time to understand the candidates' track records and proposals before voting and to ensure the exercise of civic rights by casting votes on the polling day to safeguard their rights. He also called on workers to encourage their families and friends to vote together, electing capable and pragmatic LegCo Members to jointly forge a new chapter for labour rights and benefits.

Union representatives participating in the event unanimously pledged to respond to the call and fully support the LegCo General Election. Representatives from the REACH, PCCW, Cable and Wireless Staff Association and the Cathay Pacific Airways Local Staff Union shared with participants the role played by trade unions in the LegCo General Election.

The eighth-term LegCo General Election will be held on December 7. A total of 90 LegCo Members, including 30 from the functional constituencies, will be elected, of which the labour sector has three places. Citizens may visit the election website (www.elections.gov.hk) to learn about relevant information and vote for LegCo Members of the new term on the polling day."
Hong Kong - The Ideal Platform for Mainland Enterprises in Going Global Promotion Conference held in Shanghai (with photos/video),2025-11-06 16:34,2025-11-06 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600511.htm,"âThe Hong Kong - The Ideal Platform for Mainland Enterprises in Going Global Promotion Conference, jointly organised by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), was held today (November 6) in Shanghai. The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, delivered a speech at the Promotion Conference. The event highlighted Hong Kong's unique strengths and role in assisting Mainland enterprises in expanding internationally, with a view to encouraging them to use Hong Kong as a platform for going global to tap into overseas markets.

âTo better support Mainland enterprises in going global, this year's Policy Address announced the establishment of the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global (GoGlobal Task Force), chaired by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, and comprising the HKTDC, Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK), Hong Kong's offices on the Mainland, and relevant ""Team Hong Kong"" organisations, to proactively engage Mainland enterprises to go global via Hong Kong. The Promotion Conference, being the GoGlobal Task Force's first large-scale promotional event on the Mainland and under the theme ""Hong Kong, joining hands with Shanghai to go global"", brought together a number of heavyweight speakers to share Hong Kong's advantages in different areas and attracted 500 participants.

âSpeaking at the opening ceremony, Mr Lee noted that the country is implementing a high-level strategy of two-way opening up to encourage Mainland enterprises to go global, and the momentum of Mainland enterprises' international expansion is accelerating. Mr Lee said that under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong enjoys the advantage of connecting the Mainland and the world, serving as an international financial, shipping and trade centre. The city attracts global capital and top talent and boasts a highly internationalised business environment, world-class professional services, a common law system aligned with global financial centres, a simple and transparent tax regime, and an extensive logistics network. These core strengths make Hong Kong the best platform for Mainland enterprises to go global.

âNoting that the country is expanding the scope of its high-level opening up, Mr Lee said both Shanghai and Hong Kong play crucial roles in supporting regional co-ordinated development and complement each other. Hong Kong will continue to leverage its distinctive advantages of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world, actively dovetail with national strategies, and work with the Mainland to create a new chapter of mutually beneficial co-operation.

âIn his remarks on using Hong Kong as a platform to go global, Mr Yau noted that with the unique advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is able to integrate deeply into the overall national development while maintaining seamless alignment with international rules, giving full play to its role as a pivotal platform and serving as the base for Mainland enterprises expanding overseas. The GoGlobal Task Force will establish an efficient, effective and unprecedented one-stop support platform for Mainland enterprises going global, strengthening assistance for them to systematically expand international operations via Hong Kong amid the ever-changing geopolitical landscape.

âHe added that the GoGlobal Task Force will continue to organise promotional activities across various provinces on the Mainland, proactively engaging with Mainland enterprises. Leveraging Hong Kong's distinctive advantages, robust legal environment and open economy, as well as a professional and efficient team with international exposure, the GoGlobal Task Force will join hands with Mainland enterprises in advancing into international markets.

âThe Director of the Chief Executive's Office, Ms Carol Yip; the Permanent Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Ms Maggie Wong; the Director-General of Investment Promotion, Ms Alpha Lau; and the Commissioner for Industry (Innovation and Technology), Dr Ge Ming, among others, also attended the Promotion Conference.

âThe Executive Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Xu Qifang; Member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and Executive Vice Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Mr Wu Wei; the Deputy Director General of the Department of Outward Investment and Economic Cooperation of the Ministry of Commerce, Mr Wang Qi; and the Chairman of the HKTDC, Professor Frederick Ma, also addressed the Promotion Conference.

âA number of Hong Kong business leaders were invited to attend and speak at the Promotion Conference, including the Chairman of Fung Investments, Dr Victor Fung; the Chairman of Shanghai Industrial Investment (Holdings) Company Limited, Ms Leng Weiqing; the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, Dr Sunny Chai; Deputy Chief Executive of Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited Mr Wang Huabin; the Chairman of Ernst & Young (EY) China and Regional Managing Partner of EY Greater China, Mr Jack Chan; Partner at Haiwen & Partners LLP Mr Edward Liu; and the Chairman of Dongchao Information Technology (Shanghai) Company Limited, Mr Wang Chaoyou. They highlighted Hong Kong's strengths in innovation and technology, financial services and professional services, encouraging Mainland enterprises to leverage Hong Kong's international platform to go global, and explored ways to realise complementary advantages in such sectors to jointly seize emerging opportunities in overseas markets. The Mainland enterprise representatives also shared their successful experiences of using Hongâ¯Kong as a gateway to go global.

In the afternoon, two thematic networking sessions on serving Mainland enterprises seeking to go global and innovation and technology were hosted by Ms Lau and Dr Ge respectively for in-depth promotion to Mainland enterprises of the opportunities in going global via Hong Kong. In addition, relevant experts and enterprise representatives invited by InvestHK shared experiences and successful case studies on leveraging Hong Kong's platform in going global. Key issues of concern for enterprises expanding overseas, such as legal compliance, market development and financing, were thoroughly discussed, further enhancing Mainland enterprises' understanding of Hong Kong's professional services and the one-stop support provided by the GoGlobal Task Force for attracting them to seek going global via Hong Kong.

Mr Lee and the delegation will return to Hong Kong this afternoon."
Speech by SCED at sub-forum of eighth China International Import Expo - Hongqiao International Economic Forum in Shanghai (English only),2025-11-06 16:33,2025-11-06 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600514.htm," Following is the speech bythe Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, at the sub-forum themed ""Facilitating Cross-Border Trade's Resilience through Maritime Trade Finance"" at the eighth China International Import Expo - Hongqiao International Economic Forum in Shanghai today (November 6):

Honourable Vice Minister Sheng Qiuping (Vice Minister of Commerce), Executive Vice Mayor Wu Wei (Member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China Shanghai Municipal Committee and Executive Vice Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government), Chairman and Executive Director Ren Deqi (Chairman and Executive Director of the Bank of Communications), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good afternoon. It gives me great pleasure to attend today's session on ""Facilitating Cross-Border Trade's Resilience through Maritime Trade Finance""and, on behalf of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, speak about Hong Kong's role on this important topic.

 Hongâ¯Kong is modest in size as compared with many megacities, with about 7.5 million people in terms of population and 1 100 square kilometres in area. Yet our significance on the global stage far outweighs our modest size. Rarely can you find a city that can excel on multiple fronts at the same time, but because of our convenient geographical location in Asia, world-class port and infrastructure, an extensive international trade network, presence of all major financial institutions from around the world, convergence of professional talents, and decades of tireless efforts in improving our regimes, Hong Kong has successfully achieved the status of being simultaneously an international trade centre, an international maritime centre and an international financial centre. The development of these three centres is not only closely intertwined, but in fact creates huge synergy and can reinforce one another. Our achievements are globally recognised, as Hong Kong is ranked the world's freest economy, the third largest financial centre, seventh in merchandise trade and fourth in the Xinhua-Baltic International Shipping Centre Development Index.

 So, apart from the strengths I mentioned at the outset, what are the other ingredients of our formula for success? Hong Kong is part of China and enjoys the distinctive advantage of having the strong support of our motherland, the Chinese Mainland, which is the second-largest economy in the world. At the same time, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong is a separate customs territory, adopts a free trade regime, has a simple and low tax system, applies common law, has a stable financial system and currency, and is well connected to the world. The convergence of all these advantages has placed Hong Kong in a unique position to talk about the topic today.

Maritime heritage

 Let me begin with our maritime heritage. Hongâ¯Kong's maritime story stretches back more than one and a half centuries, and over that span, the city has evolved from a modest trading port into a leading international maritime centre. There are currently over 1 200 port and maritime companies in Hong Kong, representing an increase of about 10 per cent over the past five years, despite the impact of the pandemic on international trade during that period. Our port is known for its high efficiency, with a container vessel handling time of about one day, roughly half the world average, which underpins our reputation as a ""catch-up port"" that helps vessels make up for delays encountered elsewhere.

 The quality of Hong Kong's maritime services is top-notch in the world. Three out of the world's top 10 ship management companies are headquartered in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, one can also enjoy the services of 11 out of the 12 member associations of the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Clubs and eight of the world's top 10 bookrunners of ship finance. Hong Kong is designated as one of the four arbitration venues of the Baltic and International Maritime Council, and is also the sole Asian base for many of the world's leading shipping organisations, including the International Union of Marine Insurance of Germany and the International Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom. To foster a favourable business environment for the maritime industry, the Government has launched a series of tax concessions including tax exemptions for ship leasing business and half-rate tax concessions for marine insurance, ship management, ship agency and ship broking since 2020. We plan to enhance the existing tax concessions with a view to further driving up demand for professional shipping and maritime services. Hong Kong provides an unrivalled ecosystem for maritime services companies to grow their business, which in turn allows shipping companies to easily enjoy first class maritime services. We believe that Shanghai shipping enterprises may capitalise on Hong Kong's comprehensive high-value-added maritime services package for entering into the international market.

Digitalisation and green transformation of Hong Kong Port

 As a constructive member of the international shipping community, the quality of the Hong Kong Port is closely aligned with international shipping trends, particularly digitalisation, smart transition, and green transformation. On digitalisation and smart transition, we will soon complete installation of a port community system to facilitate the flow and sharing of cargo data among stakeholders in the maritime, port and logistics industries for enabling real time cargo track-and-trace for goods routing through the Hong Kong Port. The system also has the potential to facilitate trade finance due to the use of blockchain technology to compile and store trusted data on cargo flows. We are also collaborating with the banking industry to explore leveraging blockchain-recorded cargo flow data in the system to enhance trade financing services.

 Promoting green and sustainable maritime development is another strategic priority. To meet the International Maritime Organization's net-zero emission target for international shipping by or around 2050, we promulgated the Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering in 2024, setting out clear targets, strategies and measures to develop green maritime fuel bunkering and trading in Hong Kong. In particular, we target to develop Hong Kong into a green maritime fuel trading centre, and a key channel selling and exporting Mainland-produced green maritime fuels to worldwide user companies.

Commodity trading ecosystem

 Notwithstanding our success in shipping, trade and finance, we have never stopped identifying new growth areas. The expansion of the commodity trading ecosystem serves as a new step to leverage our strengths to further promote the development of the Hong Kong economy.

 Commodities, including metals and minerals, account for more than half of the global shipping trade volume, while shipowners and commodity traders are the key users of shipping routes and maritime services. Their presence and operation in Hong Kong can drive the maritime services industry, and boost demand for related financial and professional services such as hedging activities of related futures products. Creating a commodity trading ecosystem in Hong Kong will catalyse growth across related sectors. A landmark achievement in this regard is that the London Metal Exchange (LME), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), has included Hong Kong as an approved delivery point within its global warehousing network since January this year, and 11 LME-licenced warehouses in Hong Kong have been approved. The establishment of such warehouses in Hong Kong not only will provide convenient, cost-effective and safe delivery channels for related metals trading in the region, but also increase the demand for Hong Kong's trade, shipping, warehousing and transportation industries, strengthen Hong Kong's commodities ecosystem, and lay a foundation for future expansion of related financial transactions such as futures.

 At the same time, collaboration across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, which covers Guangdong Province on the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao, further amplifies Hongâ¯Kong's role as a trade hub. Take the Qianhai Mercantile Exchange (QME) as an example. The QME, a subsidiary of the HKEX with turnover of RMB100 billion over the past year, operates our country's only offshore spot trading platform for soybeans. The HKEX continues to explore the feasibility of co-operation between the QME and Mainland commodities and futures exchanges to strengthen the two-way connectivity between domestic and overseas commodities market participants and attract more foreign enterprises to participate in trading at the platform, thereby contributing to the internationalisation of our country's commodity market.

Maritime trade finance innovation

 At the heart of Hongâ¯Kong's vision for resilient cross-border trade lies maritime trade-finance innovation. In today's evolving global landscape where trade conflicts and supply chain disruptions are reshaping established trade patterns, a more digitalised and streamlined trade finance ecosystem can greatly benefit businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular, as they transform their business model and supply chains. In this context, I am pleased to introduce Hong Kong's latest initiative to address these challenges and unlock new opportunities, i.e. Project CargoX.

 Project CargoX is a public-private collaboration launched by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Hong Kong's central banking institution. Project CargoX aims to build a more inclusive and efficient digital ecosystem for trade finance infrastructure, leveraging cargo and trade data to streamline and enhance trade finance processes; developing digital solutions to improve accessibility to trade finance for SMEs; and exploring connections with international data partners to facilitate trade financing. One of the financing challenges in the logistics industry is the handling of extensive paperwork across different regions, which burdens banks and creates hurdles for SMEs seeking loan approvals. Banks can now obtain reliable and secured data through Project CargoX, significantly saving time and labour costs for both banks and businesses.

 By aligning maritime infrastructure, green ambitions and digital trade-finance platforms, we are confident that Hong Kong will construct a resilient ecosystem capable of absorbing shocks, adapting to shifting geopolitical currents, and sustaining growth for the next generation of traders and shippers.

 Hongâ¯Kong now stands at a pivotal crossroads where a storied maritime legacy meets cutting-edge technology and sustainability, but you can tell by my introduction that Hong Kong is ready to advance to a new stage. We invite shipping enterprises, financial institutions, commodity traders and technology partners from Shanghai, the Mainland and beyond to seize the opportunities that Hongâ¯Kong offers: a digitally empowered hub where maritime trade finance can thrive, underpinning a prosperous global supply chain. Thank you."

"Film Programmes Office to launch screening programme ""Food for Thought - A Cinematic Feast"" (with photos)",2025-11-06 16:00,2025-11-06 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600214.htm,"  The Film Programmes Office (FPO) of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department will present the programme ""Food for Thought - A Cinematic Feast"" from December 6, 2025 to January 18, 2026, screening cinematic works centred on food at the Hong Kong Film Archive (HKFA), the East Kowloon Cultural Centre (EKCC) and K11 Art House, for audiences to enjoy the tastes of life in films.

  Selected films are presented in a ""menu"" comprising of ""Starter"", ""Main Course"", ""Dessert"" and ""Today's Special"". ""Kamome Diner"" (2006) and ""The Lunchbox"" (2013) are two of the films in ""Starter"". Both are light-hearted pieces telling stories of how delectable food brings strangers closer to each other. The other two films are ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (1967) and ""Toast"" (2010). The former is seasoned with humour while shedding light on racial relations through the story of a white girl bringing her African boyfriend to a dinner with her parents, while the latter is adapted from renowned British chef Nigel Slater's childhood memories.

 In ""Main Course"", one of the films, ""Babette's Feast"" (1987), is about the protagonist preparing a French feast for two sisters, who shelter the protagonist after her escape from Paris to Denmark, transforming goodness and grace into food. In ""Big Night"" (1996), two Italian immigrant brothers go to every length to save the business that they have built in the US. With Meryl Streep's masterful portrayal of renowned chef Julia Child, ""Julie & Julia"" (2009) is adapted from the true stories of two women. The story connects the two lives in two eras with a cookbook and illustrates the sense of fulfilment through cooking. Blending documentary with re-enactment, ""Cooking History"" (2009) traces the stories of cooks and soldiers and joins together six periods in military history with recipes. ""First Cow"" (2019) brings us back to the American West in the early 19th century to tell the story of two men's dreams of culinary entrepreneurship.

 Four films are highlighted in ""Dessert"". ""Tampopo"" (1985) tells the story of a widow apprenticing under a truck driver with mastery in cooking to keep the doors of her late husband's ramen shop open. The richly layered subplots of the story are copiously seasoned with dark humour, satirising society's foibles. Leaning on the side of the absurd, ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover"" (1989) is about the neglected wife of a restaurant owner having an affair with a patron in the restaurant with the help of the chef, folding love and lust into food. In the festive comedy ""The Chinese Feast"" (1995), Leslie Cheung plays the role of an apprentice cook at a restaurant, which is challenged to a culinary duel by a rival chef that will determine the fate of the restaurant. Ingredients running low, staff arriving late, and the hygiene being deemed substandard in an inspection are all happening in a restaurant in ""Boiling Point"" (2021) on the busiest night before Christmas. This single-take film, featuring the actors' precise performances, captures the suffocating tension both inside and outside the kitchen.

 ""Today's Special"" is ""Master Cheng"" (2019), a film about a professional chef Cheng, played by Chu Pak-hong, encountering a café owner Sirkka in a remote village in Finland. While Cheng brings gastronomic delights to the local people, he also finds peace with his troubled past in the scenic Finnish landscape and kindles a cross-cultural romance with Sirkka. This screening is one of the programmes of the EKCC Opening Season.

 Tickets for screenings at the HKFA and EKCC priced at $75 are now available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288.

These critically acclaimed plays, scheduled for December this year and February next year, delve into the depths of human emotions through contemporary voices and perspectives.

Details of the programmes are as follows:

Teater Katapult ""The Insider""
--------------------------------------------------



Date and time:
December 19 and 20 (Friday and Saturday), 8pm



December 20 and 21 (Saturday and Sunday), 3pm


Venue: 
Studio Theatre, Hong Kong Cultural Centre


Ticket prices:
$320 and $420




Teater Katapult from Denmark will bring this solo performance to the Hong Kong stage. The story is inspired by a real case, where European states suffer large-scale treasury losses due to an individual tax fraud. By headphones throughout the performance, the audience will be immersed in a 3D binaural soundscape, cinematic audio and multiple characters in their ears, complemented by an innovative stage design and projection effects. This will create the sensation of being transported into the protagonist's mind, witnessing his involvement in devising the monumental fraud, and later his pivotal shift in allegiance to assist police in dismantling the criminal network. The production won The Scotsman Fringe First award at the 2023 Edinburgh Festival Fringe and garnered acclaim during tours across Europe and in Korea.

Song of the Goat Theatre ""Songs of Lear""
--------------------------------------------------



Date and time:
February 6 and 7, 2026 (Friday and Saturday), 8pm



February 8, 2026 (Sunday), 3pm


Venue:
Theatre, Hong Kong City Hall


Ticket prices:
$380 and $480




As one of the most innovative voices in Poland's avant-garde theatre scene, the Song of the Goat Theatre reimagines Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" as a soul-stirring oratorio. Featuring 12 original compositions highlighting key tragic moments, the play interweaves fragments of text of Shakespeare with polyphonic singing, actors' expressive movements and ritualistic staging to reveal the emotional and spiritual essence of Lear in a bold contemporary light. This production swept three major awards at the 2012 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, including The Scotsman Fringe First, Herald Archangel and Musical Theatre Matters awards. It subsequently toured across Europe and Asia to widespread acclaim.

Tickets for the above-mentioned programmes will be available from tomorrow (November 7) onwards at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288.

為更好支援內地企業「出海」，今年《施政報告》提出成立內地企業出海專班（出海專班），由商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺督導，成員包括貿發局、投資推廣署、香港駐內地的辦事處，以及相關「香港隊」機構，以主動招攬內地企業利用香港平台「出海」。是次推介大會為出海專班首次在內地舉辦的大型宣傳活動，以「香港通道滬港攜手邁向全球」為主題，匯聚多位重量級講者分享香港在各領域的優勢，吸引500人參與。

李家超在開幕式致辭時表示，國家正實施高水平雙向對外開放戰略，鼓勵內地企業「出海」發展，內地企業「出海」的勢頭正在加速。在「一國兩制」下，香港擁有內聯外通的優勢，是國際金融、航運、貿易中心，匯聚全球資金與優秀人才，加上高度國際化的營商環境、世界水平的專業服務、與環球金融中心接軌的普通法體系、簡單透明的稅制及四通八達的物流網絡等核心優勢，是內地企業「出海」的最佳平台。

李家超說，國家擴大高水平對外開放，上海和香港都擔當着支持區域協調發展的重要使命，相輔相成。香港會繼續用好背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，主動對接國家戰略，與內地攜手開創合作共贏新篇章。

丘應樺則以「利用香港平台『出海』」為題發言。他指出，香港憑藉「一國兩制」的獨特優勢，既能深度融入國家發展大局，亦保持與國際規則的無縫接軌，可有效發揮關鍵平台角色，作為內地企業「出海」的基地。出海專班將構建高速、有效、前所未有的一站式「出海」支援平台，加強協助內地企業在多變的地緣政治中經香港有序拓展國際業務。

他續說，往後出海專班會繼續在內地不同省份舉辦推廣活動，主動接觸內地企業，以香港獨有優勢、完善的法治環境、開放的經濟體系和專業、高效、富國際經驗的服務團隊，與內地企業攜手邁向國際市場。

行政長官辦公室主任葉文娟、商務及經濟發展局常任秘書長黃少珠、投資推廣署署長劉凱旋和工業專員（創新及科技）葛明博士等亦有出席推介大會。

中央港澳工作辦公室、國務院港澳事務辦公室分管日常工作的副主任徐啟方、上海市委常委、常務副市長吳偉、商務部對外投資和經濟合作司副司長王琦，以及貿發局主席馬時亨教授亦在推介大會上致辭。

推介大會邀得本港多位商界領袖出席和發言，包括馮氏投資主席馮國經博士；上海實業（集團）有限公司董事長冷偉青；香港科技園公司董事局主席查毅超博士；中國銀行（香港）有限公司副總裁王化斌；安永中國主席、大中華區首席執行官陳凱；海問律師事務所合夥人劉洋；以及東朝科技發展（上海）有限公司董事長王朝友。他們在會上介紹香港在創新科技、金融及專業服務等領域的優勢，推動內地企業善用香港的國際平台「出海」，並探討如何在相關領域實現優勢互補，共同把握海外市場的最新機遇。出席的內地企業代表則分享利用香港「出海」的成功經驗。

下午，劉凱旋和葛明博士主持兩場分別以服務內地企業「出海」和創新科技為主題的專題對接會，向內地企業深度推介利用香港「出海」的發展機遇。此外，投資推廣署邀請相關專家和企業代表在會上分享善用香港「出海」平台的經驗與成功案例，並深入探討法律合規、市場開拓、融資等企業「出海」關注的主要議題，進一步提升內地企業對香港專業服務及出海專班一站式支援的認識，吸引內地企業來港發展「出海」業務。

李家超表示，香港在「一國兩制」下擁有國家機遇和國際機遇的雙重疊加優勢，一直擔當「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」角色。他在最新一份《施政報告》提出成立的內地企業出海專班已積極開展工作，進一步發揮「出海」平台作用。是次推介大會是成立出海專班後首次在內地舉辦的大型宣傳活動，意義重大，他歡迎更多上海和內地企業，利用香港作為跳板開拓海外市場，走向國際，共謀發展。

李家超亦感謝上海市委、市政府多年來重視和支持滬港合作。自二○○三年建立滬港合作會議機制以來，滬港兩地在經貿、金融、創新科技、文化及青年交流等領域一直合作無間，成果豐碩。

李家超說，上海黃金交易所國際板今年六月在港設立了首家境外交割倉庫，特區政府會繼續與上海市攜手推進兩地黃金交易合作。上海同時積極發展人工智能，而香港正全力發展成為國際創新科技中心，具備科研、資金、數據、人才等優勢，相信滬港兩地可發揮聯動效應，共同打造全球人工智能發展樞紐。他有信心滬港兩地會繼續優勢互補，進一步促進全方位、多領域、深層次的合作，攜手發展新質生產力。"

  In the morning, Mr Lee delivered a speech at the Hong Kong - The Ideal Platform for Mainland Enterprises in Going Global Promotion Conference (the Promotion Conference) organised by the HKSAR Government and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, highlighting Hong Kong's advantages as an international platform for going global.

  In the afternoon, Mr Lee met with the Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Mr Chen Jining, and the Mayor of Shanghai, Mr Gong Zheng. The Executive Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the CPC Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Xu Qifang, also attended the meeting. Mr Lee extended his congratulations on the successful opening of the China International Import Expo (CIIE) and expressed his wishes for its success. He expressed gratitude to the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government for their support to the HKSAR Government in holding the Promotion Conference during this year's CIIE.

  Mr Lee noted that Hong Kong enjoys the dual advantage of having both national and global opportunities under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, playing the role of a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"". The Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global (GoGlobal Task Force), proposed in his latest Policy Address, has already commenced its work with dedication, further leveraging the role of Hong Kong as a platform for overseas expansion. As the first large-scale publicity event on the Mainland organised by the GoGlobal Task Force, the Promotion Conference is of great significance. Mr Lee welcomed more Shanghai and Mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong as a springboard in exploring overseas markets and pursuing development together.

  Mr Lee also thanked the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government for their emphasis and support on Shanghai-Hong Kong co-operation over the years. Since the establishment of the Hong Kong/Shanghai Co-operation Conference mechanism in 2003, Shanghai and Hong Kong have collaborated closely in various areas such as the economy and trade, finance, innovation and technology, and cultural and youth exchanges, yielding fruitful results.

  Noting that the International Board of the Shanghai Gold Exchange launched its first offshore gold delivery vault in Hong Kong this June, Mr Lee said that the HKSAR Government will continue to work with Shanghai to promote gold trading co-operation. He remarked that with Shanghai's active development in artificial intelligence and Hong Kong's efforts in leveraging its strengths in research, capital, data and talent to develop into an international innovation and technology centre, the two places could synergise and jointly develop a global hub for artificial intelligence. He expressed his confidence that Shanghai and Hong Kong will continue to complement each other's strengths, further promoting all-round, deep and multidisciplinary co-operation to jointly develop new quality productive forces."

  Good morning. It is a pleasure to join you at the PWMA Wealth Management Summit 2025.

  I’m delighted to see many prominent private bankers, asset and wealth management specialists and other professionals gathering here to share their valuable insights on how to preserve and grow wealth in an increasingly complex and dynamic world. 

  Today’s theme, “Expanding Horizons”, speaks my mind. In a world that is beset with geoeconomic fragmentation, technological disruption, prolonged conflicts and climate challenges, the ability to think beyond borders and look ahead with vision has never been more important. Expanding horizons is a strategy for resilience and long-term growth.

  And when it comes to expanding those horizons, I can confidently say: there is no better place than Hong Kong.

Hong Kong: where we are

  For our international friends joining us today, allow me to share some encouraging developments in Hong Kong’s financial markets over the past year.

  Our stock market has shown strong momentum, rising by over 30 per cent year to date, following an 18 per cent increase last year. Trading activity has reached record highs, with average daily turnover exceeding US$33 billion. Between January and October, Hong Kong hosted 80 IPOs (initial public offerings), raising over US$26 billion. That puts us at the top of the global rankings. And at present, we have a solid listing pipeline of over 300 companies.

  A key highlight is the increasing participation by international investors in our market. For example, about 40 per cent of IPO funds raised so far this year involved cornerstone investors, from Southeast Asia and the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE (United Arab Emirates), in addition to traditional US (United States) and European funds and investors.

  At the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit which concluded yesterday, many of the top Wall Street chairmen and CEOs also expressed optimism in our capital markets. Many take the view that Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland are set to lead Asia in attracting overseas capital.

  The strong inflow of capital is also evident in our banking sector. Total bank deposits have grown by over 8 per cent this year, reaching US$2.4 trillion, following a 7 per cent increase last year.

  This renewed confidence and optimism are also reflected in our asset and wealth management sector.

Asset and wealth management business

  At last count, we managed over US$4.5 trillion of assets, a 13 per cent growth year-on-year. Notably, private banking and private wealth management accounted for over US$1.2 trillion, an impressive 15 per cent growth compared to the previous year.

  This growth momentum continues in 2025. In the first eight months alone, Hong Kong-domiciled SFC (Securities and Futures Commission)-authorised funds recorded net inflows of US$43 billion.

  On this, I would like to highlight two points.

  First, the Greater Bay Area (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, GBA). The GBA Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect was enhanced in February last year. Improvements include an expanded range of investment products, higher investment quotas for individual investors, and greater flexibility in product offerings.

  This has addressed the growing demand for offshore asset allocation among GBA residents and has been a boost for Hong Kong’s wealth management sector. Up to September this year, cumulative cross-boundary fund flows increased eight-fold compared to February 2024, reaching over RMB126 billion. The majority of these funds flowed from GBA cities into Hong Kong.

  We see clear potential to further expand the GBA Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect to include more investors and more products. Or even greater geographic coverage.

  Second, the growing family office sector. Ladies and gentlemen, you may like to know that on top of the current facilitative policies, including targeted tax concessions, we are working to further sweeten our offer by expanding the types of qualifying investments eligible for tax concessions to include emission derivatives and allowances, insurance-linked securities, loans and private credit, and digital assets. Subject to legislative processes, these changes will take effect from the current year of assessment.

  We are therefore confident that Hong Kong is on track to become the world’s largest cross-boundary wealth management centre.

Breaking new ground

  But our ambition goes further. Our vision is to elevate Hong Kong’s appeal as a premier global investment destination. A key element of this involves broadening the depth, diversity and appeal of our capital markets.

  Allow me to use the stock market to elaborate. We are advancing on multiple fronts. First, we are attracting more international companies to list in Hong Kong. Traditionally, Hong Kong has naturally been the preferred listing venue for Mainland Chinese enterprises. But as issuers and investors alike increasingly seek diversification, Hong Kong is emerging as a listing hub for companies from across the globe. To pave the way, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has since 2023 expanded its list of recognised exchanges for secondary listings - now covering 20 markets, including those in the Middle East and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations).

  In fact, in the first three quarters of this year, more than half of the newly listed companies in Hong Kong had significant international operations, with around 50 per cent of their revenue generated outside their home markets. Issuers from Thailand, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Singapore, and most recently the UAE, have chosen Hong Kong as their gateway to global capital.

  Second, we are diversifying the types of businesses represented on our Stock Exchange. While technology sectors, such as AI and robotics, biotech, and new energy, remain a core focus, we are also welcoming companies from a broader range of industries, including mining, food and beverage and consumer goods.

  Third, we are extending our geographic reach. Beyond ASEAN and the Middle East, we are actively engaging with North Asian markets, including Korea. Exchange-traded products, or ETPs, provide a powerful channel for attracting liquidity. Our strategy is to promote mutual listings of ETFs that invest in each other’s markets, thereby providing investors with more choices. For example, we listed two ETFs (exchange-traded funds) tracking Hong Kong indices on the Saudi Tadawul last year, and one of them is now the largest of its kind in the Gulf region.

  We are applying a similar strategy to the Korean market to further expand choices available to our investors.

  Fourth, we are enriching the range of products available in our markets. ETPs are a notable example. Hong Kong’s ETP market offers diverse investment options across sectors, from technology and real estate to entertainment and digital assets. Some ETPs are met with exceptional interest from investors: for instance, the total market capitalisation of digital asset ETPs has surged by more than 60 per cent year-to-date.

  Fixed-income and currency products are also gaining momentum. Hong Kong leads Asia in the issuance of international bonds arranged by Asian entities, as well as green and sustainable bonds. We are also the world’s premier offshore Renminbi (RMB) hub. 

  Building on these strengths, we recently released the Fixed Income and Currency Roadmap, which outlines our development strategy across four key areas: enhancing primary market issuance, improving secondary market liquidity, expanding offshore RMB business, and modernising market infrastructure.

  Moreover, we are committed to expanding the suite of structured products available in our market, offering sophisticated investment and risk management tools that meet the evolving needs of institutional and wealthy clients. 

  Fifth, we are working to further enhance the liquidity in our capital markets. With strong support from the Central Authorities, we are expanding and refining our Connect Schemes with the Mainland, from stocks and bonds to ETFs and derivatives, to bring additional liquidity into our market.

  All told, Hong Kong is brimming with vitality and opportunity. No wonder many international asset managers are expanding their footprint and headcount here in Hong Kong.

Closing

  Ladies and gentlemen, 2025 is proving to be a rewarding year for Hong Kong and for our financial services sector. I trust that will open up new opportunities for our asset and wealth management industry. Let’s work together to unlock new opportunities, explore new frontiers, and truly expand our horizons.

  I thank the PWMA once again for organising this Summit, and wish it a great success. And to you all, the best of health and continued prosperity. Thank you."

尊敬的徐啟方副主任（中央港澳工作辦公室、國務院港澳事務辦公室分管日常工作的副主任）、尊敬的吳偉常委、常務副市長（上海市委常委、常務副市長）、尊敬的李家超行政長官（香港特別行政區行政長官）、尊敬的楊進副主席（內蒙古自治區人民政府副主席），周強副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室經濟部副部長兼貿易處負責人）、王琦副司長（商務部對外投資和經濟合作司副司長）、馬時亨主席（香港貿易發展局主席）、各位上海和香港的嘉賓、朋友：

上午好。我代表特區政府再一次歡迎大家出席「香港：內地企業出海首選平台」推介大會。

當前，我們正見證中國企業國際化進程的重要轉變。一方面，新質生產力快速發展，數字科技、綠色經濟與跨境貿易深度融合，在這情況下，中國企業走向國際化已不再局限於以往傳統產品輸出為主，反而是以高階和全面的品牌塑造、生態構建，邁向揚帆大海新時代。

全球化發展有助於內地企業突破地域限制，將產品和服務推廣至世界不同角落，拓展客戶群體，進一步提升企業競爭力。

在宏觀層面，是向世界展示國家的進步、國力的提升。然而，在「出海」過程中，內地企業面臨幾個主要的痛點：第一，跨境資金管理、匯率風險管理等方面遇到困難；第二，對海外法律法規和合規要求存在認知差距；第三，市場文化差異較大；第四，難以獲取國際人才。這些痛點如果得不到有效解決，將限制內地企業的國際化進程。

香港在「一國兩制」下擁有獨特優勢，既能夠深度融入國家發展大局，又保持與國際規則的無縫接軌，有效發揮關鍵平台角色，能夠為企業提供系統性的解決方案，作為內地企業「出海」的基地，協助它們開拓和管理全球業務發展。

具體而言，香港的優勢體現在以下幾個方面：

第一，香港與國際市場接軌，熟知海外市場的規章和系統，是內地企業「出海」的最佳夥伴。我們的優勢廣受國際認同，是全球最自由的經濟體、全球排名第三的國際金融中心，是重要的融資平台之一，同時也是全球最大的離岸人民幣業務中心，處理全球超過70%的離岸人民幣支付業務。二○二五年首三個季度，香港交易及結算所有限公司的新股融資超過1,800億港元，同比增長230%。香港擁有完全自由兌換的貨幣體系、嚴謹的金融監管制度，以及多元化的金融產品體系，種種優勢能夠有效幫助企業解決跨境資金管理、境外融資和風險對沖等核心需求。

第二，香港實行與國際商業社會完全接軌的普通法體系，擁有強而有力的知識產權保護，中文、英文同為法定語言，在二○二五年國際仲裁調查報告排名全球第二最受歡迎仲裁地，法律地位得到國際高度認同。高效的法律環境為企業提供可靠的國際投資保障和爭議解決機制，能夠有效防範和解決國際經營中的法律風險。

第三，香港匯聚全球頂尖專業服務機構及專業人才。我們的會計標準與國際財務報告標準完全一致，律師、會計師、顧問等專業人士具備多語言能力和國際網絡，在企業海外併購、稅務安排、風險管理等領域能夠為「出海」企業提供全方位的支持，幫助企業克服國際化過程中的專業壁壘。

此外，香港有五所大學在全球100強大學排名之內，各所大學更匯聚全球科研人才，而世界級的研發配套，例如數碼港和科學園及北都的整體發展，以及初創生態圈，可以有效支援內地科創企業在港的產品研發及檢測，加速產品及技術走向全球。

為配合國家鼓勵內地企業「出海」的政策，加強協助它們在多變的地緣政治中經香港有序拓展國際業務，特區政府今年成立內地企業出海專班（出海專班），統籌和協調政府政策局、部門及相關機構的「出海」工作。我們的目標是透過調配跨局、跨部門、跨機構、跨界的資源，構建一個高速、有效、前所未有的一站式「出海」支援平台。出海專班的工作會有以下三個特點：

第一，是拓展網絡——我們會整合香港遍布全球的網絡，包括投資推廣署、香港貿易發展局、駐海外經濟貿易辦事處、駐內地辦事處等，助力優秀的內地企業有序拓展業務至更多有潛力的市場。

第二，是合作共贏——我們正在凝聚法律、金融、會計等跨界力量，促進資源整合與知識共享，發揮協同效應。目前，我們已匯聚首批支援內地企業「出海」的夥伴機構，包括熟識不同海外市場的商會、專業協會、律師行、銀行、會計師行、投資公司等，共同為「出海」企業提供全方位支援。

第三，是實效為本——出海專班將根據海外市場及企業的實際需要，提供不同多元支援服務，包括稅務、法律、融資、檢測及驗證、ESG（環境、社會及管治）、知識產權保障等多方面，協助內地企業以香港為基地，連接海外市場。

各位嘉賓，今日的推介大會只是一個開始，往後特區政府的出海專班會繼續在內地不同省份舉辦推廣活動，主動接觸內地企業，發揮功能角色。香港是國家一個特區，跟所有內地企業都是「國家隊」成員，我們有責任、有能力、有信心助力內地企業「出海」，以我們獨有優勢、完善的法治環境、開放的經濟體系和專業、高效、富國際經驗的團隊，全心全意與內地企業攜手邁向國際市場，開創全球化發展的新篇章。

謝謝大家。"
勞工及福利局局長出席「勞工界全力支持2025年立法會換屆選舉」活動致辭（只有中文）,2025-11-06 12:13,2025-11-06 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600314.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局（勞福局）局長孫玉菡今日（十一月六日）上午出席「勞工界全力支持2025年立法會換屆選舉」活動的致辭全文：

各位勞工界的朋友：

早晨！首先很歡迎大家來到這裏。今日我們有勞福局的代表——我本人、常秘（勞福局常任秘書長劉焱）、副局（勞福局副局長何啟明）；勞工處的處長（許澤森）、副處長（勞工處副處長（勞工事務行政）何錦標）、相關的助理處長（署理勞工處助理處長（勞資關係）馬國權）、高級員工；還有勞工顧問委員會的代表，以及各工會的代表濟濟一堂，一起支持十二月七日的立法會換屆選舉這個重要活動。其實今日已經是十一月六日，再過一個月多一日，便到了這個重要的日子——十二月七日投票日。

大家都很關心時事，知道今屆的立法會將選出共90名議員，由選舉委員會、功能界別和地方選區三大選舉板塊組成。每一票對於立法會換屆選舉都很重要，因為我們的一票是關係到市民的福祉，投票不只是我們的公民權利，更是我們應盡的公民責任。大家都是勞工界的朋友，勞動力是推進歷史發展的重要力量，勞工則為社會經濟發展的重要基礎。在此我不厭其煩，呼籲已登記成為團體選民的每一間職工會在投票日踴躍投票，選出三位勞工界功能界別的立法會議員為勞工發聲，促進勞工福祉。在座也有不少是公務員工會代表，我已親自發電郵予14位同工，請他們提供最大的便利讓大家在投票日代表工會，投下神聖的一票。除了要選出三位功能界別的議員之外，作為地方選區選民的全港打工仔，也有權在地方選區選出心儀的議員，在此我也呼籲大家作為工會領袖，全力動員鼓勵你們的會員和所有的打工仔，一起投下神聖的一票。

勞工界議員在立法會積極參與勞工相關政策制定和監察政府在勞工方面的施政，就各項議題提出意見，我們一起努力進發，當中處理了很多個別打工仔和市民在勞工方面的申訴和關心的議題。勞工界議員亦出謀獻策，很多勞工政策的推演和細節，都是跟勞工界議員密切商討而來。

回顧第七屆立法會，在勞工方面取得不少成果，最大的成果、不得不提的是經過幾屆政府、幾屆立法會的努力，終於落實取消強積金「對沖」的安排，這是一個劃時代的變化，終於能在這屆立法會完成。另外，大家也知道放寬連續性合約規定的《2025年僱傭（修訂）條例草案》，也是等了很久，在這屆立法會成事。此外我們也修訂了《職工會登記條例》，這對於確保國家安全，令職工會可以更健康發展，也是重要一步。

行政長官在最近的二○二五年立法會換屆選舉啟動禮強調，政府將確保選舉在公平、公正、誠實及安全有序的環境下進行，為我們創造良好的選舉條件，也讓我們可以選出代表勞工利益的議員，我本人和大家一樣對此充滿信心。

立法會作為香港特別行政區的重要立法機構，其組成直接關係到勞工福祉。我再次呼籲作為香港社會中堅力量的工會朋友及全港打工仔，在投票日踴躍投票，行使公民權利，選出愛國愛港、德才兼備的議員，與特區政府並肩同行，共同推動一國兩制的穩健發展，提高治理效能。

這次選舉對於貫徹落實一國兩制、愛國者治港原則，以及實現特區政府良政善治至關重要。勞工界團結一致，投入選舉，意義重大。不僅如此，我相信大家都會響應我的呼籲，積極動員身邊親朋好友、同事夥伴，鼓勵他們一同參與投票，選出立法會議員，為香港繁榮穩定貢獻力量。

我們需要將勞工的聲音，轉化為議會內的建設性力量，支持香港穩健發展，再創新的美好明天。讓我們以實際行動展現勞工的團結與擔當，共同開創美好的未來。

「勞工總動員，十二月七日齊投票」！謝謝大家。"
SFST's speech at Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners Asia Conference 2025 (English only),2025-11-06 11:35,2025-11-06 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600260.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners (STEP) Asia Conference 2025 today (November 6):

Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, members of STEP from across the globe,

  Good morning. It is my great pleasure to welcome you all to the STEP Asia Conference here in Hong Kong. I must say this week is rather eventful for us. We have the FinTech Week; we have the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, followed by the STEP Asia Conference. I think one thing that differentiates this one from the two that I attended earlier is that it is super quiet here. In fact this goes very much in line with the theme and also your mission, because there is a Chinese saying that ""People only get rich when you stay quiet"" (æ¶è²ç¼å¤§è²¡). After all, in this world of uncertainty and also the need for wealth planning for the future as highlighted by the theme of this year's conference, ""Thriving through Uncertainty: Wealth Planning for the Future"", we also need to be very focused and very professional in what we do. In an era of geopolitical shifts, market volatility, and rapid technological change, family offices and wealth owners are seeking not just preservation, but sustainable growth, intergenerational legacy, and positive impact. Hong Kong stands ready to be your strategic partner in this very journey.

  We have long been recognised as one of the world's top international financial centres (IFC), with our asset and wealth management industry forming a cornerstone of that strength. In fact, we have recently been ranked third globally as an IFC, and Asia's number one, with sectors including ""banking"", ""investment management"", ""insurance"" and ""finance"" ranked at the top three positions globally. Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, we serve as the important link between the Chinese Mainland and global markets - backed by a robust regulatory system, world-class professional services, and deep market liquidity.

The Government's initiatives on family offices

  The Government is fully committed to positioning Hong Kong as the premier hub for family offices in Asia and beyond. Our unique strengths - a common law system rooted in fairness and transparency, cutting-edge financial infrastructure, strategic proximity to the Mainland, and a simple tax regime - all make us the natural choice for ultra-high-net-worth families from across the world.

  We have adopted a multipronged, collaborative approach with regulators and industry partners to create a truly conducive environment. Central to this is the provision of profits tax concessions for family-owned investment holding vehicles managed by single family offices in Hong Kong. This lowers the cost barrier, allowing families to focus on long-term growth, legacy building, and impactful investing. To further sharpen our competitive edge, the Government will introduce a legislative proposal in the first half of next year to enhance the preferential tax regimes for funds, single family offices, and carried interest - ensuring that Hong Kong remains one of the most attractive jurisdictions for global capital and talent.

  Recognising the crucial role of talent and expertise, we established the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy two years ago under the Financial Services Development Council. The academy serves as a collaborative platform to network, share knowledge and enhance the capabilities of asset owners and industry practitioners, in particular the next-gen. By fostering positive financial management values and strengthening the talent pool, the academy supports the professionalisation of the sector, ensuring family offices have access to the expertise needed to thrive in a competitive and complex landscape.

  Our policies so far, I must say proudly, deliver results. In 2023, we set an ambitious target to attract at least 200 family offices to establish or expand in Hong Kong by the end of this year. We achieved this goal ahead of schedule in September this year. Building on this momentum, as announced in the latest Policy Address by our Chief Executive, we now aim to welcome an additional 220 family offices between 2026 and 2028 - further deepening and enriching our ecosystem. We will continue to refine our policy measures to keep up the growth momentum of the family office sector.

A sustainable future

  Among different investment themes, we noted sustainable investment is one of the key opportunities pursued by global family offices, as they offer attractive risk-adjusted returns amid global uncertainties. Hong Kong is well positioned, and we have established ourselves as a leading international green and sustainable finance centre in Asia. Last year, the total green and sustainable debt issued in Hong Kong exceeded US$84 billion, with green and sustainable bonds arranged in the city amounting to US$43 billion, accounting for approximately 45 per cent of Asia's total. This marks the seventh consecutive year for Hong Kong to top the league table in Asia, fully demonstrating our leadership in the green finance market.

  Bond and debt issuance aside, Hong Kong is also a pioneer in developing green and sustainable financial products. We have pioneered and witnessed the growth of various new ESG (environmental, social and governance) products in Hong Kong, including the world's first government tokenised green bond, the world's first exchange-traded fund (ETF) investing in Asian green bonds, Asia's first green retail certificates of deposit, and the world's first offshore A-share ESG ETF. These innovative products demonstrate Hong Kong's advancements in green and sustainable finance and position our market well as an ideal place to channel capital towards green and sustainable projects.

Embracing the digital asset future

  Another key theme for diversification is the embrace of non-traditional asset classes, notably digital assets. I am glad to see STEP is also doing its work in terms of promulgating different policy areas on this front. In June this year, the Hong Kong Government released our Policy Statement 2.0 on digital assets, which outlines a vision for a secure, trusted, and innovative digital asset ecosystem, with measures announced around the theme of ""LEAP"" - Legal and regulatory streamlining, Expanding the suite of tokenised products, Advancing use cases and cross-sectoral collaboration, and People and partnership development.

  The Hong Kong Government is establishing a unified regulatory regime for digital assets, covering Exchanges, stablecoin issuers, trading service providers and custodians, with investor protection at its core. Guided by the principle of ""same activity, same risks, same regulation"", our regime provides a solid ground for the market to further develop, and for global family offices and wealth owners to consider allocation in digital assets through Hong Kong's regulated and compliant offerings.

  Nowadays, global family offices and asset owners need to carefully manage risks in portfolios. To summarise the various initiatives I just highlighted, what we seek to do and also provide for the market are the ""3Cs"" - clarity, consistency, and credibility. I must say in these days, these are actually quite rare commodities in the world, and Hong Kong delivers exactly that - a stable, predictable, and forward-looking environment where wealth can thrive through uncertainty. With concerted efforts from the industry, I am confident that Hong Kong will continue to thrive as the leading family office hub in Asia and beyond. On this front, I definitely count on the support from staff and also all of you. I wish this conference every success, and I hope all of you will find the discussions ahead insightful, productive and inspiring. And in particular, if you get some time out of this busy agenda to see more of Hong Kong by yourselves, Michael (Committee Member of STEP Hong Kong, Mr Michael Olesnicky) can be the perfect guide for you. Thank you."

Employers satisfied with work performance of local graduates,2025-11-06 11:30,2025-11-06 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600183.htm,"Most employers are satisfied with the work performance of local graduates, according to the findings of a survey commissioned by the Education Bureau (EDB) released today (November 6). The survey covered students who graduated from locally-accredited publicly-funded and self-financing first degree and sub-degree programmes in 2022.

Overall, about 98 per cent of the surveyed employers were satisfied with the work performance of first degree graduates, including about 79 per cent who indicated that they were quite satisfied or very satisfied. About 96 per cent of the surveyed employers were satisfied with the work performance of the sub-degree graduates, including about 66 per cent who were quite satisfied or very satisfied. The relevant results are comparable to those of the previous round of the survey.

The survey aimed to collect employers' opinions on nine broad aspects of graduate performance, namely language proficiency, numerical competency, information technology literacy, analytical and problem-solving abilities, work attitude, interpersonal skills, management skills, technical knowledge required for the job, and knowledge of current affairs and business issues, self-learning ability and self-confidence. The survey results show that, of these nine aspects, work attitude was perceived by employers as the most important aspect of competence.

The 2022 first degree graduates performed the best in terms of work attitude and information technology literacy, followed by language proficiency. Their performance scores in all nine major aspects are over 3.50 on a five-point scale, indicating that their performance was better than ""generally meeting employers' required standard"". The overall work performance score of the graduates is 3.75, showing that they met and sometimes exceeded the employers' required standard. This is also the highest score obtained in such surveys over the years.

The overall work performance score of the 2022 sub-degree graduates is 3.57, which is also the highest score among all rounds of surveys. Their performance scores in nine broad aspects are all over 3.40, showing that their performance was better than ""generally meeting employers' required standard"". The sub-degree graduates performed the best in terms of information technology literacy and work attitude, followed by interpersonal skills.

This survey was conducted from the third quarter of 2024 to the second quarter of 2025 through questionnaires to the employers, from both private and public sectors, of the relevant graduates. Over 1 500 valid responses were received from more than 1 500 companies, organisations, and government bureaux and departments, covering over 1 300 local first degree graduates and 250 local sub-degree graduates.

The EDB has been conducting the survey since 1998 with a view to keeping track of the quality of graduates and employers' views. This survey was the 10th round. Details are available on the Concourse for Self-financing Post-secondary Education webpage (www.cspe.edu.hk/en/resources/survey-reports/)."

二十屆四中全會剛在上月底勝利閉幕，全會審議通過了《中共中央關於制定國民經濟和社會發展第十五個五年規劃的建議》（《建議》）。《建議》指出，要穩步擴大制度型開放，維護多邊貿易體制，拓展國際循環，以開放促改革促發展，與世界各國共享機遇、共同發展。

《建議》指出，要增強區域發展協調性，鞏固提升長三角、粵港澳大灣區高質量發展動力源作用。《建議》也提出，加快建設上海國際金融中心，發揮香港背靠祖國、聯通世界獨特優勢和重要作用，鞏固提升香港國際金融、航運、貿易中心地位，支持香港建設國際創新科技中心和打造國際高端人才集聚高地。

上海是國家改革開放的前沿陣地，今年更是浦東開發開放35周年，多年來上海一直以改革創新帶動長三角發展，助力國家經濟騰飛。上海和周邊地區的企業，攻堅克難、成就矚目，具備出海之勢。

上海在長三角一體化發展發揮龍頭作用，香港是粵港澳大灣區推動區域發展的核心引擎，我們都擔當着支持區域協調發展的重要使命。龍頭昂首，引擎雷鳴，滬港雙劍合璧，共同推動內地企業出海，定將為國家發展貢獻更磅礡力量。

香港特區政府重視滬港合作，全力推動雙城發展。去年十一月，特區政府在上海舉辦了一場推介大會，我當時就在現場向共聚上海的工商界朋友，介紹香港連接國內國際雙循環的平台角色，熱切感受到內地企業活力蓬勃的發展動能，大家都積極了解香港能助力企業走向國際平台的專業服務，讓我們深感鼓舞。

今年，我們以「香港通道滬港攜手邁向全球」為主題，再次在上海推介香港，通過演講分享、互動討論和對接會等環節與各位互學互鑑，一起將國際機遇對接國家動能，共同開創高質量發展的新篇章。

環顧全球，百年未有之大變局加速演進，地緣政治變幻莫測，國際供應鏈受到破壞。國家實施高水平雙向對外開放戰略，鼓勵內地企業「走出去」，既善用內地的產能，同時助力它們所到地區的經濟和社會發展。

二○二四年，中國對外直接投資超過1,900億美元，年增長超過百分之8，其中對東盟的投資增長接近四成、對共建「一帶一路」國家投資的增長超過兩成。這些數字都反映內地企業出海的勢頭正在加速。

企業在這些全球南方市場布局供應鏈和產業鏈，不但是大勢所趨，更是壯大發展的必然選擇。全球南方不但擁有顯著的人口紅利，而隨着市場發展逐漸成熟，消費需求極待釋放，其市場需求與中國完備的供應鏈能力高度契合，正是內地企業出海的新藍海。

內地企業出海的進程中，需要大量資金和專業服務的支持，也需要一個國際化的商業平台，讓產品及技術與國際接軌，更有效對接海外市場的需求。

在「一國兩制」下，香港擁有內聯外通的優勢，是國際金融、航運、貿易中心。香港擁有世界水平的專業服務，我們的普通法體系與主要環球金融中心接軌，稅制簡單透明，不設關稅和資產增值稅，物流網絡四通八達，營商環境高度國際化、市場化，匯聚全球資金與優秀人才。

我們很高興不同內地企業都通過香港平台進行籌融資、設立國際業務總部、財資中心、科研中心，以至供應鏈管理中心等，走向世界。未來，香港會繼續強化「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的雙重角色，成為內地企業出海的最佳平台、最佳拍檔。

香港是全球最自由經濟體，排名第一，不斷擴展經貿網絡，除了鞏固與傳統經濟體的關係，也重視拓展與東盟、中東和共建「一帶一路」國家等的新興市場，為企業出海增添動能。

香港已簽訂的自由貿易協定覆蓋21個經濟體，已簽訂的促進和保護投資協定覆蓋33個經濟體。我們將擴大駐海外的經濟貿易辦事處（經貿辦）的網絡，最新的駐馬來西亞吉隆坡的經貿辦，將在年底前投入運作，我們也將擴大全球經貿辦的覆蓋範圍，深化在地的經貿推廣工作。

香港將繼續推進多邊貿易，包括爭取盡早加入《區域全面經濟伙伴關係協定》。我剛於上周在韓國出席亞太區經濟合作組織會議，其間與不同經濟體和國際組織的領袖會面交流，增進關係，推動自由貿易和經濟融合。

特區政府會繼續出訪不同國家和地區，宣傳香港的優勢和機遇。今年五月，我率領了50多位香港和內地企業商貿代表，剛才吳市長也提過了，訪問卡塔爾和科威特，一同向中東地區介紹國家發展的龐大機遇，成果豐碩，簽署了59項合作備忘錄和協議，涵蓋經貿、金融、科技、法律、航空、教育等領域。一些參團的內地企業，之後更選擇落戶香港，以香港作為國際總部、財資和科研中心，發展跨國業務。當中有一家內地企業，更已在香港成功上市。

為更好服務內地企業出海，我在今年九月發表的《施政報告》中提出設立一站式平台內地企業出海專班，主動招攬有意拓展海外業務的企業以香港為平台出海。專班已在上月初成立，並已經開展工作。稍後，特區政府商務及經濟發展局丘應樺局長將為大家詳細介紹。

今年是國家「十四五」規劃的收官之年，也是「十五五」規劃的謀篇布局之年。國家將擴大高水平對外開放，拓展雙向投資合作空間。香港會繼續主動對接國家戰略，與內地攜手開創合作共贏新篇章。

各位，黃浦江的浪奔浪流成就商業睿智，維港兩岸的出海跳板接軌環球市場。滬港拼船出海，一同洞察世界潮汐起伏，一同揚帆遠航發展新藍海，一同為強國建設貢獻更大力量。

最後，我祝願今天大會圓滿成功，在座各位乘風破浪，大展鴻圖。謝謝大家。"

Simon (Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, Mr Simon Chan), Hendrick (Chairman of the Cyberport Investors Network Steering Group, Mr Hendrick Sin), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

I am glad to join you all today at the Cyberport Venture Capital Forum (CVCF) again this year. 

  Before I start, I am delighted to share some exciting news that underscores Hong Kong's growing stature in the global digital landscape. Just two days ago, the International Institute for Management Development released its latest World Digital Competitiveness Ranking 2025, in which Hong Kong achieved an impressive fourth place globally. This marks a continued upward trajectory - we climbed three positions last year, and we rose again by three more places this year. Such progress reflects not only our resilience and adaptability in this ever-evolving digital world but also our determination and capability to develop Hong Kong into an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre.

  Hong Kong has long been an ideal landing place for I&T enterprises and investors from the Mainland and overseas. Recognising the potential of AI as a key driver for our future growth, we continue to strengthen the AI readiness of our community, from upgrading our digital infrastructure, to establishing our own AI (artificial intelligence) research institute, to grooming talent on the AI front. These initiatives will fuel the growth of AI as a key industry in Hong Kong and reinforce Hong Kong's role as an international I&T centre.

   Cyberport has made significant contributions to the local I&T ecosystem. Over the years, Cyberport has developed and sustained a vibrant community that empowers digital pioneers and start-ups to thrive. Its success in attracting around 470 enterprises to land here last year resonates strongly with Hong Kong's vision.

   Today's forum perfectly aligns with Cyberport's mission to connect visionary entrepreneurs with strategic investors. Beyond merely providing a starting point for start-ups, the $400 million Cyberport Macro Fund leverages private capital at a scale of one to nine, connecting Cyberport digital entrepreneurs with market capital and enabling projects with potential to expand by turning breakthroughs in R&D (research and development) into commercial successes. 

   The forum also showcases the dynamic lineup of high-potential start-ups within the Cyberport community and demonstrates how Hong Kong stands at the forefront of creativity and technology. This is a launch pad for ventures that aspire not just to succeed locally but to make waves internationally.

âUnder the theme ""The Innovation-Venture Nexus: Igniting Transformative Success"", I trust that today's forum will enlighten participants on how bold ideas and breakthrough technologies are driving a new wave of transformative growth. May this gathering not only inspire deal flows and collaboration but also reinforce our city's position as a leading I&T hub.

Before I conclude, I would like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that the Legislative Council General Election will take place on December 7, 2025. It is vital for all eligible voters to exercise their right and cast their votes. Your vote is important for us to build a prosperous and innovative Hong Kong for the years to come.

  Let's continue to embrace growth together, where bold ideas meet smart capital, and where our future is launched. Thank you, and I wish CVCF 2025 every success."

 The race covers a total distance of 231.8 kilometres, comprising a 55.8km section in Hong Kong. The race convoy will travel through the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) and go through the Hong Kong Port, North Lantau Highway and Penny's Bay Highway. The athletes will return after passing by the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and head back to Zhuhai via the HZMB and Hengqin. It is anticipated that the race convoy will enter the Hong Kong section around 10.20am and spend about one and a half hours in the Hong Kong section.

 To facilitate the holding of the race, temporary control measures will be implemented on the HZMB Hong Kong Port, the HZMB and some roads on that day. Members of the public and visitors should pay attention to the following key points:


Temporary control measures will be implemented on the HZMB westbound from Hong Kong towards Zhuhai/Macao from 7.30am to 12.30pm. The Departure Hall of Passenger Clearance Building and Outbound Vehicle Clearance Plaza of the HZMB Hong Kong Port will close at 6.30am. Travellers or vehicles wishing to leave Hong Kong for Zhuhai or Macao before the implementation of the temporary control measures are required to arrive at the Departure Hall of Passenger Clearance Building or Outbound Vehicle Clearance Plaza of the HZMB Hong Kong Port before 6.30am on the event day in order to undergo departure and clearance procedures.

Members of the public and travellers should plan their trips in advance and allow sufficient travel time. They are advised to use railway services, including the Airport Express, the Tung Chung line and the Disneyland Resort line, and avoid driving to the above road sections. Drivers who need to drive to the airport can also consider using the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Tunnel.
	
The departure and clearance services at the HZMB Hong Kong Port will resume after 12.30pm on that day. It is expected that traffic will be busy. Members of the public should note that as the roads within Zhuhai are still closed for the race until about 2.30pm, the Gold Bus from Hong Kong to Zhuhai is expected to provide limited service from 12.30pm to 1.30pm. Members of the public are advised to avoid heading to the Hong Kong Port in haste. The Gold Bus from Zhuhai to Hong Kong will resume service at 2.30pm. Meanwhile, theGold Bus services to/from Macao will resume at 12.30pm. The Transport Department (TD) has instructed the Gold Bus operator to draw up manpower arrangements in advance and reserve sufficient backup vehicles to meet passenger demand upon the resumption of normal boundary-crossing services. Members of the public and travellers who need to travel between Zhuhai and Macao on that day are advised to plan their journeys early and use other land Boundary Control Points (BCPs) as far as possible and pay attention to the traffic control arrangements within Zhuhai.
	
The Police will set up a temporary restricted flying zone (RFZ), extending 2km outwards from the race track from 9am to 1.30pm on November 8.

The PTOs have been issuing notices gradually to inform passengers. Alert messages were also issued to applicants of Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles and the HZMB closed road permit holders on the temporary control measures of the HZMB and the Hong Kong Port on that day. In addition, the TD will alert motorists to the latest traffic information through Full Variable Message Signs in tunnels and control areas concerned. Meanwhile, MTR Corporation Limited will assist to step up public broadcast in all heavy railway stations. The TD will also urge CB and local travellers and members of the public to take heed of various public transport arrangements in CB traffic, travelling to and from the airport and Tung Chung as well as the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and plan their journeys early, via the HKeMobility mobile application, radio, TV and Agent T Facebook page (www.facebook.com/AgentT.hk).
	
The Islands District Office has disseminated the relevant message to residents in the district through the district network (including District Councils, Area Committees and District Committees, Youth Committees, as well as District Services and Community Care Teams). Some Care Teams in the district have set up street stalls and distributed leaflets at various locations in the area for several days before the event day and posted relevant information on social media, so that residents could be informed of the special transportation arrangements on the day of the event and thus plan and adjust their travel accordingly. The Care Teams have also assisted in contacting property management companies and village representatives in the district and requested them to post the above TD notice at conspicuous places for residents' information. On the day of the event, the Care Teams will deploy staff to inspect the district and provide appropriate assistance to members of the public in need.

No regular public transport services will be provided for the artificial island of Zhuhai. From 7.30am to 11.30am that day, only limited services for routes departing for Zhuhai will be provided by Gold Bus. Members of the public are advised to avoid taking Gold Bus to Zhuhai during the abovementioned periods. Moreover, some of the ferry services between Hong Kong and Zhuhai Jiuzhou Port will also be suspended on November 8 and 9.

 To facilitate a better viewing experience, a public viewing zone will be set up on the footpath of Fantasy Road located outside the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, which can accommodate a few hundred spectators. Members of the public may come to cheer the athletes and enjoy the race there. The Police will implement crowd management measures subject to area conditions. Members of the public are advised to follow instructions of the Police and staff on site. As temporary traffic control measures will be implemented on the race route at the North Lantau Highway, members of the public should take the MTR to the Disneyland Resort station as far as possible to reach the designated viewing zone.

All rights-holding broadcasters, including the three local free television broadcasters and Radio Television Hong Kong, will be conferred the live signal.

âA spokesperson for the NGCO said that as the NG is the country's highest-level event, this event has to meet stringent requirements regarding race course selection and organisational arrangements to ensure athletes' safety. Relevant departments will work together to facilitate the special traffic and transportation arrangements to minimise the impact on the public and travellers who usually use the HZMB and other related road sections. Members of the public and travellers who need to travel to and from Zhuhai or Macao are urged to plan their itineraries in advance and use other control points and public transport as far as possible. The spokesperson thanked the public and travellers for their understanding, as well as the contributions of various organisations and departments implementing the relevant arrangements."

另外，十五運會自行車（公路）比賽（女子個人賽）將於十一月九日舉行，雖然比賽路線主要涉及珠海市內，不影響港珠澳大橋及口岸通關服務，但由於賽事關係，珠海市內部分道路將會封閉，珠海人工島沒有常規公共交通服務，在當日上午七時三十分至十一時三十分期間，金巴往珠海只能夠提供有限度服務，建議市民避免在上述時段乘坐金巴前往珠海。此外，香港與珠海九洲港十一月八日和九日部分渡輪航班亦會暫停。

為方便公眾觀賞賽事，香港迪士尼樂園度假區以外的幻想道行人路將設公眾觀賞區，可容納約數百名觀眾，市民可到場觀賽和為運動員打氣。警方會視乎現場情況，適時實施人流管制措施，請市民聽從現場警方及工作人員指示。由於北大嶼山公路的賽道路段將實施臨時交通管制措施，市民應盡量乘搭港鐵到迪士尼站再步行前往指定觀賞區。廣東賽區已委託主廣播機構中央電視台直播相關賽事，所有持權媒體，包括香港三間免費電視台和香港電台，均可取得直播訊號。

全運會統籌辦發言人表示，全國運動會為國家最高水平賽事，今次賽道選擇及組織安排須符合嚴格要求，以確保運動員安全。各部門已協調落實特別交通運輸措施，盡量減少對經常使用港珠澳大橋及相關路段的市民和旅客影響。發言人呼籲當日需往返珠海及澳門的市民和旅客及早規劃行程，盡量改用其他口岸及公共交通，並感謝市民、旅客體諒，以及各機構和部門通力合作。"
Update on chikungunya fever (with photo),2025-11-05 21:00,2025-11-05 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/05/P2025110500820.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 5), the CHP has recorded two new imported cases of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest cases information
-----------------------------

 The first case involves a 55-year-old female living in Sai Kung District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Foshan in Guangdong between October 27 and 30. She developed joint pain on November 1, rash and a fever on November 2 and 3 respectively. She sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Tseung Kwan O Hospital yesterday (November 4).

 The second case involves a 37-year-old female living in Tuen Mun District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she arrived in Hong Kong from Bangladesh on November 1. She developed a fever and joint pain on November 3. She sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Tuen Mun Hospital yesterday.

 Their blood samples tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testings. They have been admitted to the hospital for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and are currently in stable condition. Each patient has two household contacts. These household contacts and the travel companions of the 55-year-old female to Foshan, are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since the two patients stayed in Guangdong Province and Bangladesh respectively during their incubation periods, the CHP considered that they were infected abroad. The cases are classified as imported. The CHP will report the cases to the relevant health authorities.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------
Hong Kong has recorded a total of 58 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, three were local cases and the rest were imported cases. For the local case recently announced, the CHP is carrying out genome analysis for the 45-year-old male to ascertain whether it has epidemiological linkage with cases confirmed in Hong Kong earlier.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
--------------------------------------------------------------

In view of the local case recorded recently, the CHP, based on the risk assessment, urged the residents living near Mount Haven in Tsing Yi, Kwai Chung Plaza and Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they develop symptoms such as fever, rash or joint pain after October 1.

This afternoon, the CHP and the Kwai Tsing District Office co-organised a health talk at the Cheung Hang Community Hall in Tsing Yi to enhance public understanding of mosquito-borne disease. Over 100 residents attended. Last night, the online seminar on CF held by the CHP attracted over 11 00 total views.

Additionally, the CHP officers and relevant District Services & Community Care Teams have distributed leaflets on CF prevention to over 10 000 households in Mount Haven and the surrounding areas , Kwai Chung Plaza, Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan and the vicinityto remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

Regarding the three local cases, the CHP has set up health consultation booths at Cheung Hang Community Hall in Tsing Yi, Kwai Fong Estate (near Kwai Ming House), the pedestrian bridge towards the east exit of Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan and Fung Tak Shopping Centre in Wong Tai Sin to provide assessments to members of the public with relevant symptoms. The CHP has already assessed over 11 000 residents in Wong Tai Sin Fung Tak Estate and its vicinity. Blood tests conducted on 42 individuals with mild symptoms have all returned negative results. Furthermore, the health consultation booth in the Fung Tak Shopping Centre in Wong Tai Sin has only sporadic visits recently. In view of the above, the booth will cease operations starting tomorrow. The inquiry hotline (2125 2373), which was set up earlier, will continue to operate daily from 9am to 8pm. The remaining three health consultation booths will continue to operate daily, please visit theCHP's webpagefor the addresses and operating hours.

As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 21 000 individuals working or residing at districts with higher risk, and 50 individuals with mild symptoms have been arranged to undergo blood tests, details are as follows:





In the vicinity of Fung Tak Estate in Wong Tai Sin

TheFood and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

ãã
 The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD.

海關人員於十月十日在羅湖管制站截查兩名分別三十一歲及三十歲抵港女旅客。海關人員在三十一歲抵港女旅客所攜帶的個人行李和嬰兒手推車內檢獲8 400支未完稅香煙，估計市值約三萬四千元，應課稅值約二萬八千元；以及在三十歲抵港女旅客的個人行李內檢獲約八千四百支未完稅香煙，估計市值約三萬四千元，應課稅值約二萬八千元。該兩名女旅客隨即被捕。三十一歲及三十歲女旅客今日就違反《條例》分別被法庭判處監禁六星期和罰款四千元，及監禁兩個月和罰款五千元。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/tc/）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Two incoming passengers convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2025-11-05 20:25,2025-11-05 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/05/P2025110500787.htm,"Two incoming female passengers were respectively sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment and two months' imprisonment, and fined $4,000 and $5,000 by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (November 5) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted two incoming female passengers, aged 31 and 30, at the Lo Wu Control Point on October 10. Customs officer seized 8 400 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $34,000 and a duty potential of about $28,000, from the 31-year-old incoming female passenger's personal baggage and baby stroller. About 8 400 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $34,000 and a duty potential of about $28,000, were seized from the 30-year-old incoming female passenger's personal baggage. They were subsequently arrested. The 31-year-old female passenger was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment and fined $4,000, while the 30-year-old female passenger was sentenced to two months' imprisonment and fined $5,000,by the court today for contravening the DCO.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence imposes a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/en/)."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況（附圖）,2025-11-05 20:04,2025-11-05 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/05/P2025110500760.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月五日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————

首宗個案涉及一名55歲女子，住所位於西貢區。初步調查顯示，她於十月二十七日至三十日到訪廣東省佛山市，十一月一日出現關節痛，翌日出現皮疹，並在十一月三日發燒。她昨日（十一月四日）到將軍澳醫院急症室求醫。

另一宗個案涉及一名37歲女子，住所位於屯門區。初步調查顯示，她於十一月一日由孟加拉國抵港，十一月三日出現發燒及關節痛。她昨日到屯門醫院急症室求醫。

兩名病人的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，已獲安排留院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她們各有兩名家居接觸者，有關的家居接觸者，以及與55歲女子同行到佛山市的人士目前都沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於兩名病人在潛伏期曾分別在廣東省及孟加拉國，中心認為她們是在外地受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會把個案通報相關衞生部門。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得58宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，三宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。就日前公布的一宗本地個案，中心正對該名45歲男子的病毒進行基因分析，以判斷是否與本地早前錄得的個案有流行病學關連。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應日前錄得本地個案，中心按風險評估呼籲青衣曉峰園、葵涌廣場及上環信德中心一帶居民，若於十月一日後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛症狀的人士，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。

今日下午，中心和葵青民政事務處在青衣長亨社區會堂合辦教育講座，加深市民對蚊傳疾病的認識，有逾100人出席。而中心昨晚舉行有關基孔肯雅熱的網上講座，總觀看人次超過11 000。

此外，中心人員和有關地區的關愛隊已向曉峰園和附近的居民、葵涌廣場及上環信德中心一帶超過10 000個單位派發有關預防基孔肯雅熱的單張，提醒居民留意有否相關病徵和注意家居的環境衞生。

就三宗本地個案，中心已在青衣長亨社區會堂、葵芳邨近葵明樓、上環信德中心東出口方向行人天橋和黃大仙鳳德商場設立醫護站，為出現相關症狀的市民作評估。因應中心已為超過11 000名黃大仙鳳德邨一帶的市民作評估，42名出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查結果均為陰性，再加上近日僅有零星市民前往黃大仙鳳德商場的醫護站，該醫護站將由明天起停止運作，而早前設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）會繼續每日由上午九時至下午八時運作。其餘三個醫護站會繼續每天開放，地址和運作時間請參閱中心網站。

截至今日下午五時，中心已為逾21 000名在較高風險地區工作或居住的市民進行評估，並為50名的出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查，詳情如下：

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

She was certified dead later in the hospital. The LD is saddened by the death of the worker and expresses its deepest sympathy to her family.

  The LD's spokesman said, ""We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and have issued a suspension notice to the contractor concerned, suspending the demolition work. The contractor cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that suitable measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken.""

  The spokesman added, ""We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation.""

  To ensure the safety of workers engaged in demolition work or those working nearby, the LD reminds employers to formulate proper and safe demolition methods, including providing suitable support to the structures being demolished or those affected by the demolition work to prevent them from accidental collapse; and to properly fence off the demolition work areas with suitable warning notices displayed to prevent any unauthorised entry of persons into dangerous areas.

  The general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance require employers to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

  In regard to today's accident, the LD will issue a Work Safety Alert through its mobile application ""OSH 2.0"", website and email, giving a brief account of the accident concerned to duty holders, workers' unions, professional bodies of safety practitioners and others, and reminding the industry of the importance of following safety precautionary measures to prevent a recurrence of similar accidents.

  The LD will also remind the employer concerned of the liability for employees' compensation under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, assist family members of the deceased to claim employees' compensation and closely follow up on the case. For those with financial difficulties, the LD will assist them to apply for appropriate emergency funds. Subject to the needs and wishes of the family members of the deceased, the LD will also liaise with the Social Welfare Department for financial or other assistance.

  For the sake of securing the safety and health of employees at work, the LD appeals to employers to provide plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health. Employees should also co-operate with their employers, adopt all safety measures and use personal protective equipment provided properly to avoid endangering their own work safety and that of other workers."

衞生防護中心調查一宗猴痘確診個案,2025-11-05 19:10,2025-11-05 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/05/P2025110500730.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月五日）表示，正調查一宗猴痘確診個案，並提醒市民提高警覺，避免與懷疑感染猴痘的人士作密切身體接觸，同時強烈建議高風險目標群組人士接種猴痘疫苗。

個案涉及一名29歲男子。他於十月二十七日出現皮膚潰瘍，十一月三日到衞生署油麻地男性社會衞生科診所求診，被轉介至瑪嘉烈醫院進行隔離，目前情況穩定。

根據病人提供的資料，他沒有接種猴痘疫苗，於潛伏期內曾在香港有高風險接觸。中心暫未發現任何資料顯示這宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他猴痘確診個案有流行病學關連。中心正繼續就個案進行流行病學調查，會設法聯繫與他有高風險接觸的人士，並將個案通報世界衞生組織。

香港自二○二二年六月起已制定猴痘準備及應變計劃，並於同年九月出現首宗猴痘確診個案後，啓動該計劃下的戒備級別。中心實施的一系列措施（包括加強個䅁監測、接觸者追蹤、公眾教育和疫苗接種等）在過去三年有效防止猴痘在本地出現爆發。

自二○二二年起至今，本港共錄得82宗猴痘個案（66宗本地個案和16宗輸入個案），當中14宗於今年錄得，全部病人均為男性。流行病學調查顯示，絕大部分個案曾進行高風險性行為，包括與陌生人發生性行為或在沒有佩戴安全套的情況下進行性行為。香港至今未有發現新型猴痘病毒株（分支Ib型）的個案。

中心提醒高風險目標群組人士應接種猴痘疫苗，以減低感染或感染後出現較嚴重病徵的機會。此外，出現猴痘症狀（包括皮疹、發燒、發冷、淋巴結腫大、疲乏、肌肉痛及劇烈頭痛等）或懷疑自己受感染的人士應立即求醫並接受治療，不應與其他人進行可能接觸到皮疹或體液的活動。市民亦應時刻保持良好個人及手部衞生，預防經接觸傳播或感染病毒，並避免與懷疑感染猴痘的人或動物作密切身體接觸。

CHP investigates confirmed Mpox case,2025-11-05 19:10,2025-11-05 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/05/P2025110500729.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) said today (November 5) that it is investigating a confirmed Mpox (also known as Monkeypox) case, and urged the public to be vigilant and avoid close physical contact with persons suspected of contracting Mpox. Meanwhile, high-risk target groups are advised to receive Mpox vaccinations.

The case involves a 29-year-old male. He developed a skin ulcer on October 27. He attended the Yau Ma Tei Male Social Hygiene Clinic of the DHon November 3 and was referred to Princess Margaret Hospital for isolation treatment. He is currently in stable condition.

  According to the patient, he had not received Mpox vaccination and he had a history of high-risk exposure in Hong Kong during the incubation period. No epidemiological linkages between this case and other confirmed cases recorded in Hong Kong earlier could be identified so far. The CHP is continuing its epidemiological investigations of the case, will attempt to contact individuals who had high-risk exposure to him and will report the case to the World Health Organization.

Hong Kong has put in place the Preparedness and Response Plan for Mpox since June 2022 and activated the alert response level under the Plan after the first confirmed case of Mpox in September of the same year. The CHP has implemented a series of measures (including enhanced surveillance, contact tracing, public education and vaccination), which have been effective in preventing local outbreaks of Mpox in the past three years.

Since 2022, a total of 82 Mpox cases (66 local and 16 imported) have been recorded in Hong Kong, of which 14 cases were recorded this year. All the patients were male. Epidemiological investigations revealed that most cases had history of high-risk sexual behaviour, including having sex with strangers or without wearing condoms when having sex. Hong Kong has not yet detected any new Mpox strain (Clade Ib) cases.

The CHP reminded high-risk target groups to receive Mpox vaccinations in order to lower the risk of infection or the possibility of having more severe symptoms after infection. In addition, persons who experience Mpox symptoms (including rashes, fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, exhaustion, muscle pain, and severe headaches) or suspect themselves of being infected are advised to seek medical attention and receive treatment at once. They should not engage in activities with others that may expose others to their skin rash or body fluids. Members of the public should maintain good personal and hand hygiene to prevent virus transmission or infection through contact. They should also avoid close physical contact with persons or animals suspected of being infected.

The CHP has set up an Mpox telephone hotline (2125 2373), which operates from Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm, excluding public holidays. Those who suspect or are concerned that they may have had high-risk contact with confirmed cases, particularly men who have sex with men or those who have sexual practices with strangers, can use the hotline to make enquiries and receive relevant health advice.

Furthermore, the DH provides vaccination services to high-risk groups of Mpox. The following high-risk target groups are eligible for Mpox vaccinations on a voluntary basis:


individuals with high-risk sexual practices, e.g. having multiple sexual partners, sex workers, or having a history of sexually transmitted infection within the past 12 months;
healthcare workersresponsible forcaring forpatients with confirmed Mpox;
laboratory personnel working with zoonotic pox viruses; and
animal care personnel with high risk of exposure in case of Mpox occurrences in animals in Hong Kong.


  High-risk target groups can receive Mpox walk-in vaccinations at any of the DH's Social Hygiene Service Clinics (SocHS) (namely Chai Wan SocHS, Wan Chai Male SocHS, Wan Chai Female SocHS, Yau Ma Tei Male SocHS, Yau Ma Tei Female SocHS, Yung Fung Shee SocHS, Fanling SocHS and Tuen Mun SocHS) and the DH's Yau Ma Tei Integrated Treatment Centre.

Meanwhile, the DH's Kowloon Bay Integrated Treatment Centre and the Hospital Authority's Special Medical Clinics at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital also provide Mpox vaccination services for their clients.

勞工及福利局局長：歡迎大家來到今日護老藍圖的成果發佈會，希望大家見到護老藍圖裏所提的方法，對於如何支援照顧者提供一個借鑑，令社區有不同的工具幫助我們的照顧者。

記者：四天內發生了三宗工業意外，之後如何避免悲劇發生？

勞工及福利局局長：最近我們也留意到一些相對並非很大型的工程發生了工業意外，我想藉此機會呼籲業界，無論工程大小都要做足安全措施。當然，針對每一宗的工業意外，我們都會嚴肅跟進和調查，如當中有任何疏忽或違法的地方，我們會嚴肅追究。

記者：之前都已有修改相關守則和指引，但現在仍有這麼多工業意外，會否擔心可能是修改後沒有人跟進，是否應該要多加巡查？應該要怎樣做才可以令他們真的跟足指引去做？

勞工及福利局局長：就工業意外的預防我們一向強調幾點，其一當然是要釐定守則，然後進行宣傳、教育、巡查，如最後發現是有法不依、有守則但沒有跟循的情況，我們當然是要嚴肅跟進，罰則方面大家都知道在過去一段時間已大幅提升。藉此機會我再次提醒大家，永遠都要謹記，已有清晰的安全守則，無論工程大小都要安全第一，一定要先確保安全之後才去施工。

記者：浸大有外判清潔工指「被自願離職」，公司要求他簽已擬定好的辭職信，最後他在壓力下辭職，勞工處會否介入調查，會否有方案避免同類事情再發生？

勞工及福利局局長：香港有完善的勞工法例，每位工友均受勞工法例的保障，我剛剛也了解過，理解到這位工友暫時未接觸勞工處，但我已要求勞工處勞資關係科同事主動了解她的經歷和認為受委屈的地方，看看能否通過勞工處的勞資關係科幫助她。我也想藉此機會提醒廣大工友，如認為自己應得的權益、在法律下的權益受到損害，或認為有不妥當的地方，隨時可以去勞工處，各區都有不同的辦事處可以幫助他們。針對這個個案，我已要求同事想辦法聯絡她，看看有沒有地方可提供多些資訊和協助，如發現有需要幫忙的地方，我們會通過勞資關係科為她提供幫助。

記者：除此之外有沒有發現有些違規的問題，會否作跟進或處分？

勞工及福利局局長：這牽涉到兩個層面，一是僱員和僱主之間如有矛盾或爭議，勞工處的勞資關係科擔當調停的責任，為僱員提供協助。至於經過調停後或在進一步資料搜集後，發現有任何地方牽涉法例，一定會有後續跟進、依法辦事。現時最重要是弄清工友面對的真實情況，通過勞工處主動提供協助，看看是否可以解決雙方關心的事。

記者：今早的塌牆事故是否涉及工程公司疏忽？當局會否考慮修例，要求進行清拆工程時要呈報？

勞工及福利局局長：我們現在正進行調查當中，調查後如有任何一方違反法例或相關守則，我們一定會作跟進。不同守則下有不同呈報機制，我們會不時檢討守則是否有需要修訂的地方，並對每個個案作嚴肅跟進。多謝大家。"
律政司司長在粵港澳大灣區法律部門人員培訓課程結業典禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-11-05 18:38,2025-11-05 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/05/P2025110500720.htm,"以下是律政司司長林定國資深大律師今日（十一月五日）在粵港澳大灣區法律部門人員培訓課程結業典禮的致辭：

各位嘉賓、各位學員：

首先，我真的非常高興可以出席今日下午舉辦的2025年第三屆粵港澳大灣區法律部門人員培訓課程的結業典禮。

我衷心感謝每一位，特別來自廣東、澳門和香港特區律政司的學員的積極參與和認真學習，讓這次培訓課程能夠順利完成。剛才聽到三位來自廣東、澳門和香港學員的分享，我也感到非常興奮和鼓舞。首先我知道你們在三日的課程中，尤其是廣東、澳門過來的朋友，對香港普通法制度的理解可能加深了，我也知道你們昨日到法院參觀並旁聽一宗刑事案件，對有關的審訊過程特別感興趣，我覺得這是非常重要的，因為我們談一個法律制度的運作，不單只是看書本，你需要看到實踐中的運作，才能理解一些背後的理念。我相信參與的香港學員，通過這個課程，也對內地、澳門的法律制度，一些實際情況，加深了相當的理解，所以我覺得非常好。

剛剛在二十屆四中全會（中國共產黨第二十屆中央委員會第四次全體會議）通過的有關「十五五」規劃的建議，我注意到第二十八點提到需要增強區域發展協調性，特別有一句說需要鞏固粵港澳大灣區高質量發展動力源作用。我相信法律合作依然是我們國家未來發展非常重要的一環，香港不單是我們國家唯一實行普通法的管轄區，也是全世界唯一中英雙語的司法管轄區。我們的法律制度公正完善，與國際高度接軌，也擁有非常多有國際經驗的法律人才，這個優勢在大灣區的發展中讓香港能扮演一個特別的角色。我們常常說粵港澳三地需要有優勢互補的作用，是「一國、兩制、三法域」，我以前也有提到怎麼描述我們的關係，我說過廣東、香港、澳門就是三兄弟，「兄弟同心，其利斷金」，所以我希望在未來，我們能繼續加強大灣區三個不同法域之間的交流合作，積極推動法律服務的合作共融，無論是在仲裁、調解，甚至是糾紛及其他範疇，我相信都有充分的、很大的、廣闊的空間，讓我們加強合作。

過去兩年的培訓課程，分別是前年在澳門舉辦，去年在廣東，今年在香港，所以明年應該再在澳門舉辦了。我希望在這三日課程以後，除了剛才的分享以外，其他的學員能積極地向我們提供多一些意見，我期望明年當我們到澳門的時候，這個課程會辦得比今年還要好，所以我們需要你們的意見。我鼓勵你們盡量向我們提出有關課程的想法及建議，為下一年的培訓課程做好準備。

另外，我也向大家發出邀請，我們在十二月初、第一周將會舉辦香港法律周，這是我們特區政府主辦的一年一度旗艦活動，當中有些內容跟大家非常有關係。今年的主題是「法匯香港，聯通世界」，內容涵蓋國際法、替代爭議解決的發展、法律科技與人工智慧、粵港澳大灣區發展的機遇、涉外法治等議題。尤其在十二月五日將舉行第一屆粵港澳大灣區律師論壇，我非常期待屆時能再次見到大家。

最後，祝大家工作順利。廣東和澳門的朋友，平安回家，身體健康。我希望未來有更多機會及時間再跟你們作交流。謝謝。"

2025 OEP Award Presentation Ceremony held today to welcome National Games with elderly (with photos),2025-11-05 18:35,2025-11-05 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/05/P2025110500308.htm,"âThe Social Welfare Department (SWD) today (November 5) held the 2025 Award Presentation Ceremony of the Opportunities for the Elderly Project (OEP). The theme of the event was ""Ignite the Fire of Life, Thrive in Fulfilling Ageing."", aiming to inspire the elderly in maintaining physical health and to echo the positive energy emanated from the 15th National Games. The event also featured a variety of games with sports elements and exciting performances, bringing joy to over 800 elderly persons across the territory and award-winning teams, as well as over 4 000 participants who joined the ceremony online.

Officiated by the Director of Social Welfare, Mr Edward To; the Chairman of the Elderly Commission, Dr Donald Li; and the Chairman of the OEP Advisory Committee, Mr Silas Poon, the ceremony presented six Special Awards for one-year projects in 2024-25, 11 District Best OEP Awards, and three Hong Kong Best OEP Awards to commend outstanding teams.

With the opening ceremony of the 15th National Games nearing on November 9, Mr To said that sports elements were added to the ceremony this year to encourage the elderly to live a vibrant and fulfilling life. He remarked in a brief review of the OEP that nearly 7 500 programmes have been subsidised since its inception in 1998-99, recording more than 4.45 million participants, among whom 2.64 million were elderly persons. Each and every one of them was a successful and inspiring story of active ageing.

In the ceremony, Dr Li emphasised that the life experience and wisdom of the elderly are actually valuable assets of society. He expressed his hope that elderly persons will stay active and continue to live fulfilling lives. Other than that, Dr Li encouraged the elderly to participate in workshops organised by the Elderly Academy Scheme or elderly centres where they can broaden their social networks and acquire knowledge of gerontechnology to keep pace with the times, thereby improving their physical and mental wellness.

  The OEP encourages elderly persons to develop their potential, continue their contributions to society, and live the spirit of positive ageing through subsidising a diverse range of programmes organised by district organisations. Caritas Elderly Centre - Kwun Tong was awarded the Championship of the Hong Kong Best OEP Award for one-year projects. The project fully demonstrates intergenerational harmony and strengthens community cohesion by directly involving the elderly in organising community cultural tours, ranging from route and attraction planning to telling community members and students about the cultural stories of Kwun Tong. Photography, Teochew culture workshops and community visits were also organised with young people.

Starting from 2020, the first Thursday of November has been designated as OEP Day by the SWD, and this year marked the sixth edition. OEP Ambassadors, comprising elderly volunteers, will hold exercise sessions at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres to show the energetic side of the elderly and promote the active spirit of OEP Day throughout the community tomorrow (November 6).

2025「老有所為活動計劃」頒獎典禮今日舉行　與「老友記」同迎全運會（附圖）,2025-11-05 18:35,2025-11-05 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/05/P2025110500303.htm,"​社會福利署（社署）今日（十一月五日）舉辦2025「老有所為活動計劃」頒獎典禮，以「燃點生命之火躍動豐盛晚年」為主題，鼓勵長者保持健康體魄和活力，響應第十五屆全國運動會的正能量精神。典禮亦加設多項富運動元素的遊戲及精彩表演，與800多名來自各區的長者及得獎團隊同樂，並有超過4 000人透過網上直播同步參與。

頒獎典禮由社署署長杜永恒、安老事務委員會主席李國棟醫生和「老有所為活動計劃」諮詢委員會主席潘廣輝主禮，並頒發二○二四至二五年度「一年計劃」六個特別獎項、十一個地區最佳獎項及三個全港最佳獎項，以嘉許表現傑出的參與團體。

杜永恒致辭時表示，適逢第十五屆全國運動會將於十一月九日正式開幕，今年的典禮特別加添運動元素，鼓勵長者躍動樂齡人生。他回顧指社署由一九九八至九九年度推行「老有所為計劃」以來，共資助接近7 500個計劃，參與人數超過445萬人，當中包括264萬名長者，譜寫出無數「積極樂頤年」的精彩故事，成績令人鼓舞。

頒獎禮上，李國棟醫生強調長者的人生經驗和智慧正是社會的寶貴資產，他寄望長者退而不休，繼續活出豐盛人生。另外，李醫生亦鼓勵長者多參與「長者學苑計劃」或長者中心的工作坊，擴闊社交網絡之餘，又可善用樂齡科技與時並進，改善身心健康。

「老有所為活動計劃」透過資助不同地區團體舉辦各式活動，讓長者發揮潛能，繼續貢獻社會，實踐「老有所為」的精神。今年得到全港最佳「一年計劃」的冠軍團隊是明愛觀塘長者中心的「友里攜手．樂聚觀塘」，計劃透過舉辦社區文化導賞團，由長者導賞員設計路線及景點，向社區人士及學生細說觀塘社區文化故事，更與年青人一同舉辦攝影班及潮汕文化工作坊及進行社區探訪活動，充分展現跨代共融，連繫社區凝聚力。

社署由二○二○年開始，將每年十一月第一個星期四定為「老有所為日」，今年已經踏入第六年。由長者義工擔任的「老有所為」推廣大使，將於明天（十一月六日）的「老有所為日」在各區長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心與長者一起做活力操，展現長者充滿活力的一面，繼續全城推廣「老有所為」的積極精神。

勞工及福利局局長出席「凝聚跨界力量•共譜護老藍圖」成果發佈研討會致辭（只有中文）,2025-11-05 18:28,2025-11-05 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/05/P2025110500702.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十一月五日）下午出席「凝聚跨界力量•共譜護老藍圖」成果發佈研討會的致辭全文：

張校長（聖方濟各大學校長張仁良教授）、林正財醫生（行政會議成員）、盧教授（聖方濟各大學副校長盧鐵榮教授）、Mabel（李國賢基金會董事局成員李黃眉波）、Philip（李國賢基金會董事局成員李嘉輝）：

很高興再次來到聖方濟各大學這個漂亮的演講廳，參與這個重要的聚會──護老藍圖的成果發佈研討會。我剛才參觀了九間機構的展位，我對它們都很熟悉，獲益良多。尤其是有機會聽到幾位前線社工現身說法，亦很高興和幾位種子護老者導師有短暫的交談機會，讓我有不少啓發。

我知道在座有很多位其實也是不同程度的照顧者，當中亦包括我本人，大家家中很多也有長者，都參與不同程度的護老工作，只是參與程度不同。剛才跟照顧者們談天，我未有機會請教每一位的名字，但剛剛有一位是Circle，他說了些很有啓發性的說話──照顧者不應經常認為自己在承擔責任，中國人傾向「攬上身」，意思是說「沒辦法，誰讓我嫁給他？」、「誰讓我是他的兒子？」、「如果他老了、病了，我照顧他是應份的」等，這些想法不是錯，但純粹認為是一份責任，隨着照顧者壓力越來越大，這份責任便越來越重，如一塊大石頭砸下去，苦不堪言，常常覺得「有苦自己知 」。Circle說不應這樣想，應該重新尋找價值觀，找到做照顧者的意義。我認為這句話對我啓發很大，若能做到便可由苦不堪言進入苦中作樂，繼而希望有苦有樂，最後希望能超然一點，多點關心自己。

另一位是Mei Ling，她給了我一張紙，這張紙不僅對照顧者很有用，對為政者也同樣有用，上面寫了有很多大家想要的選項，如愛情、健康、友情、事業成功、驕傲、自尊等好事，讓你挑選十項，再從中選出五項，即留下五項，其實要反省究竟在人生當中，那麼多美好的事物中哪些是重要的，固然對於照顧者要選擇，其實對我們來說何嘗不是也要作出選擇，選擇出最重要的，就全心全意去做好最重要的一件事，結果就更理想，效益就更大。

我在這裏很感謝兩間大學，聖方濟各大學和香港城市大學，其實張校長兩間大學也曾服務過，再加上九間非政府組織一起努力，做了這套基礎工作是很有意義的，其意義在於校長剛才也提到，現在香港面對的是長期的高齡化挑戰，數字大家都耳熟能詳，現在每四個人，就有一個是65歲以上的老人家，20年後到二○四六年便有約36%是65歲或以上，這並不是最震驚的，最震驚是80歲以上的人口，現在每20個有一個，即約5%，到二○四六年去到16%，這才是我們最大的挑戰。

其實現時65歲以上的老人家有很多健康是沒問題的，但即使65歲時仍很健康，也不能擔保到80歲是否仍然健康，80歲後的照顧需要確實大很多，我們確實要想一想如何可以照顧好雙老長者，他們當中很多是照顧者，有了照顧者藍圖的工作，現時我們很有信心能找出很多有需要的照顧者，包括你們做的工夫，現在我們可以將大數據打通，已解決了私隱問題，也在試行當中，無論是向房屋署取得住戶冊，我們派關愛隊上門洗樓，可以找出一些有需要的長者；我們跟醫院管理局的數據打通，很快又找到一些有需要的照顧者，這些都做到的了。

以前我們的難題是不知道他們在哪裏，現在我們的難題在於找出來之後的下一步該如何。找出來只是第一步，其後就要照顧了，當然有些嚴重的個案要跟進，但我相信大多數個案用一些今日見到的實用方法，是可以幫忙的，所以我們很期待今日的發布會，再加上大家動動腦筋，任何方法只要可以成功應對老齡化挑戰都要去試用，我在這裏多謝大家。

在結束之前，我想作出一個呼籲，大家都可能猜到了。我認為這很巧合，剛才我走訪了多個攤位，他們都給我一個模式，就是五大需要、七項資源，加起來是一個魔法數字──十二，後面是七，十二月七日是重要的立法會換屆選舉日。我呼籲大家一定要在十二月七日投神聖的一票，因為選出來的立法會議員會和政府一起努力，一起要做好大家最關心的事情，就是做好護老共行的工作。這裏也有另一個十二的數字──三個主辦單位加九個非政府組織。我近來見到十二和七的數字組合特別醒神。大家一定要出來投票，選出心儀的立法會議員，多謝大家。"

FEHD releases ninth batch of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in October,2025-11-05 18:00,2025-11-05 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/05/P2025110500687.htm,"ããThe Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (November 5) released the ninth batch of gravidtrap indexes and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in October, covering six survey areas, as follows:â




District
Survey Area
October 2025


Area Gravidtrap Index

Among the ninth batch of Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering six survey areas in October, all were below 10 per cent, except two survey areas, Hung Hom and Kai Tak North in Kowloon City District.

For the two survey areas in Kowloon City District that recorded an index over 10 per cent, in accordance with the mechanism implemented by the FEHD in response to the recent chikungunya fever (CF) situation (i.e. strengthening mosquito control work in areas with a gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, instead of 20 per cent or above under the original mechanism), the FEHD is collaborating with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with high mosquito infestations and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. In particular, the gravidtrap data for Hung Hom and Kai Tak North showed that areas with more mosquito problems included parks, public housing estates and construction sites. The relevant departments and stakeholders are actively following up on the mosquito control work. The FEHD will also organise exhibitions, distribute leaflets and posters, and notify the residential estates that have subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and work together on mosquito prevention and elimination measures. In addition, the FEHD continues to strengthen the monitoring of the gravidtrap indexes in these two areas to review the effectiveness of the mosquito control work.

The FEHD has so far released nine batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in October 2025, covering 64 survey areas. Among these 64 survey areas, 43 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index the previous month, i.e. September 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Nineteen other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD is disseminating the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of CF transmission.

ââFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

十月份第九批涵蓋六個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，除了九龍城區紅磡和啟德北這兩個監察地區，其餘都在10%以下。

針對九龍城區內指數高於10%的兩個監察地區，按因應基孔肯雅熱情況而實施的安排（即將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域），食環署正聯同有關部門及持份者找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。紅磡和啟德北誘蚊器的數據顯示蚊患較多的地方包括公園、公共屋邨和建築地盤，各相關部門及持份者正積極跟進控蚊工作。食環署亦會舉辦宣傳展覽、派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。此外，食環署亦繼續加強監察該兩個地區的誘蚊器指數，以檢視滅蚊工作成效。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十月共九批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共64個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年九月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這64個監察區中，43個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有19區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

​收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

​食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Advisory Committee on Water Supplies and Drinking Water Safety Advisory Committee jointly visit Dongjiang Water Supply System (with photos),2025-11-05 17:40,2025-11-05 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/05/P2025110500606.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Advisory Committee on Water Supplies:

A delegation of the Advisory Committee on Water Supplies (ACWS) departed for Guangdong Province yesterday (November 4) to visit the Dongjiang (DJ) Water Supply System and learn about the latest situation of matters in relation to DJ water supplied to Hong Kong. As this year marks the 60th anniversary of DJ water supply to Hong Kong, the Drinking Water Safety Advisory Committee (DWSAC) also joined the visit to inspect the quality of DJ water supplied to Hong Kong. The delegation concluded its fruitful two-day visit today (November 5). Both committees agreed that the DJ Water Supply System is well managed and that the DJ water supplied to Hong Kong is of good quality.

During the two-day visit, the delegation visited the main operational facilities of the DJ Water Supply System, including the Xinfengjiang Reservoir in Heyuan, the DJ River Basin Water Quantity and Quality Monitoring and Control Centre in Huizhou, the intake point of DJ water supplied to Hong Kong at Taiyuan Pumping Station in Dongguan, the Jinhu aqueduct in Tangxia, Dongguan, the Shenzhen Reservoir, and the adjacent Environmental Water Quality Monitoring Centre. The delegation was briefed by the officers concerned about the design and operation of the facilities of the Dongjiang-Shenzhen Water Supply System and inspected the quality of DJ water supplied to Hong Kong.

In summing up the visit, the Chairman of the ACWS, Professor Joseph Kwan, considered the two-day visit, covering several major operational facilities of the DJ Water Supply System, to be enriching. It deepened members' understanding of the situation of the DJ water supplied to Hong Kong and allowed members to observe the good quality of the DJ water at a close distance. Members deeply appreciated the country's long-standing support in safeguarding the quality and quantity of DJ water supplied to Hong Kong, which has contributed to Hong Kong's prosperity and steady growth. He also praised Heyuan as a good example of balancing ecological conservation and economic development, highlighting its commitment to protecting DJ water sources while leveraging its high-quality water sources and ecological environment to sustainably develop eco-tourism, the water beverage and food industries.

The Chairman of the DWSAC, Dr Chan Hon-fai, remarked during the visit to the Xinfengjiang Reservoir that the Reservoir, located in the upper stream of the DJ River Basin, maintains stable surface water quality and serves as a vital fresh water source for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. He expressed satisfaction with the local authorities' concerted efforts in safeguarding DJ water quality. A young ACWS member noted that this visit held special significance as this year marks the 60th anniversary of DJ water supply to Hong Kong. Through the inspection of the DJ Water Supply System and exchanges with government officials of Guangdong Province, he gained a deeper understanding of the stringent water resources protection regulations and measures formulated and implemented by the country, as well as the substantial investments made in infrastructure, and research and application of technological innovation to ensure a stable supply of high-quality DJ water to Hong Kong. He deeply felt the country's care and steadfast support for the well-being of Hong Kong society.

The terms of reference of the ACWS are to advise the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region through the Director of Water Supplies on matters relating to water supplies, including water resources, network management, regulation and control of inside service, water conservation and other operational matters. It comprises members from academia, green advocates, professionals, trades and officials from related government departments and the bureau.

The DWSAC advises the Development Bureau on the regulatory regime for drinking water safety in Hong Kong, drinking water standards, and policies and operational matters relating to drinking water safety. In addition, it reviews global concerns on matters related to water safety as well as directions for new research proposed by the Government in light of international practices, trends and developments."
