SK（AllRightsReserved（ARR）創辦人及創意總監林樹鑫）、Peter（香港旅遊發展局主席林建岳博士）、Randy（香港麥當勞行政總裁黎韋詩）、Patrick（宏利香港及澳門行政總裁白凱榮）、Diane（港鐵市場策劃及收益管理總經理趙敏）、Andy（八達通消費業務及產品總監葉勁生）、James（昂坪360董事總經理董沛銓）、各位贊助單位代表、各位嘉賓、所有傳媒朋友和市民：

大家下午好！很開心，大家應該跟我一樣，滿懷期待和興奮來到今日AllRightsReserved舉行的「維港海上大巡遊」開幕典禮。因為上個月這些IP（知識產權）前來香港的時候，應該是有些風雨，但大家都會前往拍照，所以都很開心和期待。我曾經在很多其他場合說過，近年香港文化及知識產權熱潮席捲全球，成為推動文化和旅遊發展的重要動力。特區政府一直積極把握這股潮流，與業界攜手推動文藝創意產業的蓬勃發展。除了文體旅局（文化體育及旅遊局）外，其實不同政策局及部門亦同心協力為盛事的主辦機構及業界提供全方位支援，為市民和訪港旅客帶來不同類型、具吸引力的文化旅遊盛事。

今個夏天，我估大家跟我一樣參觀了ARR主辦的「CHIIKAWA DAYS」的大型特展，那時的氣氛跟今日的天氣一樣熾熱，不單香港市民，其實來自世界各地的旅客和粉絲，都專程到訪香港參與盛事。今次ARR再下一城，設計及籌辦這個全球首創、雲集世界知名IP的「維港海上大巡遊」，將來自不同地方的人氣IP結合世界知名的維多利亞海港美景，以得意可愛的流行文化元素突顯香港繽紛多彩和創意活力，再次展示香港作為國際盛事之都的吸引力。巨型充氣雕塑由今日開始於添馬公園對出跟大家見面，配合融合IP特色的快閃店、主題餐飲及互動遊戲體驗的巡遊市集，剛才我們也玩了一些遊戲，其實頗困難，但回報卻很大，所以我想鼓勵大家試試。而萬眾期待的巨型充氣雕塑海上大巡遊，剛才SK也提到，下星期六，即十一月一日就會進行。我期待世界各地的朋友都親身來港參與這次活動，盡情打卡，親身感受香港獨特多元的魅力。

旅遊與文化互相交織，彼此帶動。未來，我們期望社會各界與一眾本地及國際藝術家繼續攜手合作，百花齊放，讓更多融合獨特IP元素的活動在香港落地生根。我們亦會繼續與不同主辦單位合作，帶來更多不同類型、具吸引力的文化旅遊盛事，為旅客帶來嶄新而難忘的體驗，亦令香港的文化旅遊發展更上一層樓。

在此，容許我作兩個呼籲，一個呼籲是在旁邊舉行的美酒佳餚巡禮，今日是第三日，會一直營業至深夜，越夜越繽紛，希望大家逛完IP展後，順便前往美酒佳餚巡禮。第二個呼籲是二○二五年立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日舉行。在此誠邀各位積極投票，選出愛國愛港、具有能力、有志服務香港的優秀人才，跟我們一起同創美好明天。

最後，我衷心祝願「維港海上大巡遊」活動圓滿成功。多謝大家。"

莊國民亦表示，隨着阿德萊德與香港的直航航班即將恢復，現在正是親身體驗香港的都市動感與文化魅力的最佳時機。

歷時三星期（十月十七日至十一月九日）的澳亞藝術節每年舉辦，是澳洲最具代表性和糅合亞洲文化的當代藝術節。今年的藝術節節目內容豐富，涵蓋來自亞洲各地的戲劇、舞蹈、音樂、視覺藝術、文學、美食和文化活動，匯聚超過200名來自澳洲和海外包括香港在內的藝術家，並呈獻六個全球首演節目。"

The display showcases Hong Kong's unique position as a cultural bridge between East and West, while also honouring the growing creative collaboration between Hong Kong and Australia.

The OzAsia Festival, organised by the Adelaide Festival Centre, stands as a leading international arts festival in Australia. The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, Sydney (Sydney ETO) is proud to once again be part of the Festival, bringing Hong Kong's creativity to Adelaide through the stunning Hong Kong Dragon Lantern showcased at the Festival's iconic Moon Lantern Trail.

Speaking at the OzAsia Festival Opening Night, the Director of the Sydney ETO, Mr Ricky Chong, said that the Sydney ETO has long supported initiatives that advance Hong Kong's role as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange under the National 14th Five-Year Plan. The Sydney ETO was pleased to support contemporary art platform Hong Kong Soul at the Adelaide Fringe and the Hong Kong String Orchestra performing in Adelaide earlier this year. These exchanges strengthen cultural ties and foster lasting friendship between Hong Kong and South Australia.

He introduced the key measures announced in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" to promote the integrated development of culture, sports and tourism, generating fresh economic momentum and further enhancing Hong Kong's global appeal. Mr Chong noted that the Kai Tak Sports Park, the largest sports infrastructure project ever built in Hong Kong, has already opened its doors and hosted a series of major events. Hong Kong will also cohost the National Games with Guangdong and Macao, which will take place next month.

Mr Chong remarked that with direct flights between Adelaide and Hong Kong soon to resume, there is no better time to experience Hong Kong's vibrant energy and cultural dynamism.

Held annually over three weeks (October 17 to November 9), the OzAsia Festival is Australia's leading contemporary arts festival that engages with Asia. This year's festival presents a rich programme spanning theatre, dance, music, visual arts, literature, cuisine, and cultural events from across the region. The vibrant line-up features more than 200 artists from Australia and abroad including Hong Kong, with six world premieres to be staged."

Latest developments in investigation of accident involving B744 cargo aircraft deviating from North Runway after landing and ditching into sea (with photos),2025-10-25 01:37,2025-10-25 01:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/25/P2025102500013.htm,"The Air Accident Investigation Authority (AAIA) is conducting an in-depth investigation into an accident involving a B744 cargo aircraft (flight number UAE9788), arriving from Al Maktoum International Airport, United Arab Emirates, which deviated from the North Runway of Hong Kong International Airport after landing and ditched into the sea on October 20, in order to determine the circumstances and causes of the accident.

After detailed planning and coordination, the professional team commissioned by the Airport Authority Hong Kong is carrying out the salvage operation to remove the cargo aircraft involved in the incident, in order to enable the AAIA to conduct further inspections and an in-depth investigation.

To expedite the collection of data required for the investigation, the AAIA successfully retrieved the Flight Data Recorder and the Cockpit Voice Recorder, commonly known as the ""black boxes"", from the aircraft wreckage late last night (October 24). There is water ingress into the two ""black boxes"". The AAIA has promptly sent the devices to the laboratory for preliminary examination to determine the next course of action.

  Experts will conduct in-depth analysis of the collected data, including reconstructing the sequence of events through the data from the ""black boxes"", interviews with relevant personnel, laboratory findings, examination of the aircraft wreckage, aircraft operating procedures, aircraft system status and maintenance records, weather conditions, and other relevant factors, to prepare a report.

Pursuant to Annex 13 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the investigation into this accident is being led by the AAIA, which is also responsible for the dissemination of information. Notifications have been issued to the State of Registry, the State of the Operator, the State of Design and the State of Manufacture of the aircraft in accordance with Annex 13. Investigative authorities from these countries have appointed accredited representatives and experts to participate in the investigation and provide professional advice. Personnel from the National Transportation Safety Board of the United States and the Transport Safety Investigation Center of Türkiye have arrived in Hong Kong, while experts from Boeing are also participating.

""Following the successful recovery of the 'black boxes', the subsequent data processing, along with a thorough analysis and integration of other evidence, will take time. We will release a preliminary investigation report within one month and continue to conduct a thorough and rigorous investigation to determine the sequence of events and causes of the accident, as well as to propose safety recommendations to enhance aviation safety,"" an AAIA spokesperson said.

The AAIA, an independent investigation authority formed under the Transport and Logistics Bureau, is responsible for the investigation of civil aircraft accidents and incidents in accordance with the Hong Kong Civil Aviation (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations (Cap. 448B) and with reference to the International Civil Aviation Organization's standards. Pursuant to the Hong Kong Civil Aviation (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations (Cap. 448B), the AAIA is responsible for investigating all aircraft accidents and incidents occurring within Hong Kong territory, including those involving passenger aircraft, cargo aircraft, business jet and general aviation (such as light aircraft and helicopters), regardless of whether the aircraft is registered in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the State of Registry, the State of the Operator, the State of Design and the State of Manufacture of the aircraft involved in the accident or incident may appoint accredited representatives to participate in investigations."

經詳細的規劃和部署後，香港機場管理局委託的專業團隊正進行飛機打撈工作，以移走失事貨機，供民航意外調查機構進行進一步檢查及深入調查。

為盡快收集調查所需數據，民航意外調查機構已於昨日（十月二十四日）深夜從飛機殘骸中成功取回俗稱「黑盒」的「飛行數據紀錄儀」及「駕駛艙話音紀錄儀」。兩個「黑盒」有入水情況，民航意外調查機構已隨即把相關裝置送往實驗室作初步檢查，以決定下一步工作。

專家會針對搜集到的資料進行深入分析，包括透過調查還原「黑盒」內的數據、與相關人員的面談內容、實驗室實證結果、飛機殘骸、飛機操作程序、飛機系統狀況和維修紀錄、天氣情況等，重塑意外經過，撰寫報告。

根據《國際民用航空公約》附件13，是次意外調查由香港的民航意外調查機構主導以及負責資料發放，並按附件13通報飛機登記國、營運國、設計國及製造國。這些國家調查機構已委派授權代表及專家參與調查，就本次意外調查提供專業意見，美國國家運輸安全委員會以及土耳其運輸安全調查中心已派員抵港，而波音飛機的專家亦有參與。

民航意外調查機構發言人表示：「成功取回『黑盒』後，後續的數據處理以及充分分析和整合其他證據需時。我們將於一個月內發表初步調查報告，並繼續進行徹底及嚴謹的調查，以確定事故的發生經過和成因，並提出安全建議，提升航空安全。」

民航意外調查機構是運輸及物流局下成立的一個獨立調查機構，負責根據《香港民航（意外調查）規例》（第448B章）及參考國際民用航空組織的標準，進行民航意外及事故的調查。根據《香港民航（意外調查）規例》（第448B章），在香港境內發生的飛行意外及事故，包括客機、貨機、商務飛機及通用航空（如小型飛機及直升機等），不論飛機是否在香港註冊，都會由民航意外調查機構負責調查。同時，意外或事故所涉及的飛機的註冊國、經營人所在國、設計國及製造國可委任授權代表，參與意外或事故的調查。"

Primary Healthcare Commission announces priority booking arrangement for Hospital Authority's Family Medicine Out-patient Services (with photo),2025-10-24 21:23,2025-10-24 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400605.htm,"The Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) under the Health Bureau announced today (October 24) that the Family Medicine Out-patient Services Priority Groups Pilot Scheme of the Hospital Authority (HA)'s Family Medicine Out-patient (FMOP) Services will be launched on November 4, it set the priority groups of underprivileged population in need of public primary healthcare services which could make priority booking for FMOP Services.

To address the needs of the underprivileged group in seeking consultation, the HA will launch the Pilot Scheme to allocate as appropriate some of the priority quotas to the priority groups. Priority groups include recipients of the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme, recipients of the Old Age Living Allowance aged 75 or above, Level 0 Voucher Holders of the Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme for the Elderly, and recipients of the Working Family Allowance (WFA) Scheme (the priority group eligibility for WFA Scheme recipients is valid for 12 months from the issue dates of their grant application letters).

Individuals belonging to the priority groups can be eligible in the Pilot Scheme, and make priority bookings for FMOP episodic consultations, after registering as members of District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) and as priority group members for FMOP Services via the eHealth mobile application (eHealth app) or in person at DHCs. When making an appointment, registered individuals may first select their respective priority group through the booking system of the eHealth app. The system will then connect to the ""HA Go"" mobile application to make a booking for FMOP episodic consultations and the process does not require them to re-enter personal information. The system will offer priority quotas based on individual's eligibility as priority groups (refer to Annex). Consultation fees will be charged according to the standard rates of FMOPs.

Participants in the Pilot Scheme can also join activities organised by DHCs to better manage their own health. The Government had successfully set up DHCs in all districts across the city by the end of 2022. Each DHC will set up several satellite centres/service points, mainly providing health promotion, health risk assessment, disease screening, chronic disease management and community rehabilitation services and more. For more details, please visit the DHC website.

The Primary Healthcare Blueprint proposed developing a prevention-oriented primary healthcare system, and repositioning the HA's General Out-patient Clinic services to prioritise serving underprivileged groups. The Pilot Scheme is a major initiative according to the implementation plan of the Blueprint. Together with the HA's General Out-patient Clinic and Family Medicine Specialist Clinic services, which were unified under the name ""FMOP Services"" earlier this month, these measures mark that Family Medicine will be the core of the public primary healthcare, the team of FMOP will serve as family doctors for underprivileged groups, providing those in need with people-centered and prevention-focus healthcare services.

After the launch of the Pilot Scheme, the PHC Commission and the HA will closely monitor and evaluate its effectiveness and the utilisation of priority quotas. They will also reserve priority quotas as appropriate and adjust the proportion of priority quotas based on needs and the actual situation, with a view to ensuring that the priority groups will be benefited."
CHP responds to media enquiries on Seasonal Influenza Vaccination School Outreach Programme,2025-10-24 20:55,2025-10-24 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400727.htm,"In response to media inquiries regarding the latest situation of the Seasonal Influenza Vaccination (SIV) School Outreach Programme, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (October 24) gave the following response:

All schools may choose to use live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV nasal vaccines)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To further optimise the School Outreach Programme, this year all schools may opt for the LAIV nasal vaccines and the ""hybrid mode"", which allows schools to choose both the injectable inactivated influenza vaccines and the LAIV during the same or different outreach vaccination activities. So far, the CHP has not received any reports from schools or medical teams indicating that supply issues have prevented the arrangement of the LAIV nasal vaccine.

School outreach activities this season will generally be completed earlier than last season
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To boost SIV rates, enrolment for the SIV School Outreach Programme has started since the beginning of June this year, which was earlier than last year. With the concerted efforts of the Government and various community sectors (including the medical sector and schools), approximately 2 300 schools (99 per cent) are going to arrange SIV school outreach activities. Among these, about 1 350 schools (59 per cent) have scheduled to carry out the outreach activities by the end of this month, and over 2 190 schools (95 per cent) by the end of next month (November), which are respectively higher than last year's 45 per cent and 83 per cent. All in all, this season's school outreach activities will generally be completed earlier than last season's.

Since the start of the school year, about 930 schools have held SIV school outreach activities, which is higher than of 650 compared to the same period in the last season. In view of this year's summer influenza season, coupled with the recent increase in seasonal influenza activity and the number of school outbreaks, the CHP has actively contacted the schools in mid-October, urging them to try to further advance school outreach activities where feasible. Currently, 23 schools have responded to the CHP's call to advance their outreach activities, originally scheduled for December this year or January next year, to be held by the end of next month.

The CHP expressed sincere gratitude to the schools and medical institutions which co-operated to advance vaccination activities. The CHP understands that participating schools have to take into account various objective factors such as the school calendar and staffing when scheduling school outreach activities, and coordinate with participating medical teams on the appropriate time. Should schools encounter any difficulties in advancing their outreach activities, they may contact the CHP during office hours at 3975 4872 and the CHP will provide full assistance.

Vaccine supply is subject to pharmaceutical companies' production schedules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) usually announces the seasonal influenza virus strains for the Northern Hemisphere from February to March each year. Pharmaceutical companies worldwide then produce appropriate vaccines based on the WHO's announcement for public procurement. Due to the time required for production and transportation, experience shows that vaccines normally arrive in different countries and regions between September and October the earliest. In the past two years, the CHP has actively engaged with pharmaceutical manufacturers with a view to secure vaccines as early as possible. This year, the CHP received the vaccines around mid-September.

The CHP will continue to closely monitor the vaccine supply at the international level and the implementation of the SIV School Outreach Programme, striving to ensure stable vaccine supply and enhance the flexibility of the School Outreach Programme in order to meet the vaccination needs of different groups and better safeguard public health."

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

根據《應課稅品條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Customs officers intercepted a 29-year-old and a 30-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on August 14. About 29 400 duty-not-paid cigarettes and about 25 800 alternative smoking products, with an estimated market value of about $197,000 and a duty potential of about $97,000 and about 28 800 duty-not-paid cigarettes and about 43 000 alternative smoking products, with an estimated market value of about $247,000 and a duty potential of about $95,000 in total, were seized from their personal baggage respectively. The passengers were subsequently arrested. The 29-year-old passenger was sentenced to four months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 by the court today while the 30-year-old passenger was sentenced to five months' imprisonment and fined $1,000.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.
 
Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

蚊傳疾病基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的最新情況,2025-10-24 19:30,2025-10-24 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400658.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月二十四日）公布基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的最新情況。

基孔肯雅熱

截至今日下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

個案涉及一名44歲女子，住所位於元朗區。初步調查顯示，她於九月二十日至十月十九日到訪廣西壯族自治區桂平市。她於十月二十二日出現發燒、關節痛及皮疹，昨日（十月二十三日）到博愛醫院急症室求醫。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。病人目前情況穩定，會被安排在醫院的無蚊環境下接受治療。

由於她在潛伏期曾到訪廣西壯族自治區，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報內地衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得44宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。當中一名患者死亡，其餘患者病況輕微。

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。


登革熱

由十月十七日至昨日（十月二十三日），中心錄得一宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期到過廣東省雲浮市。

截至昨日，今年錄得50宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。世衞去年（二○二四年）錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。由二○二五年一月至七月，全球97個國家／地區呈報了超過400萬宗登革熱個案及超過3 000宗相關死亡個案。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點亦普遍流行，印度尼西亞、印度、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年已分別錄得超過四萬宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過3 500宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得2 181宗本地感染病例，其中383宗病例於十月六日至十二日的一周內錄得，以深圳、廣州、潮州、江門和東莞錄得的病例最多。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於登革熱及基孔肯雅熱確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​​​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, chikungunya fever and dengue fever",2025-10-24 19:30,2025-10-24 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400661.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 24) reported the latest situation of chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF).

Chikungunya fever

  As of 5pm today, one new case of CF had been recorded.

  The case involves a 44-year-old female living in Yuen Long District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Kweiping in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region between September 20 and October 19. She has developed a fever, joint pain and rash since October 22, and sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Pok Oi Hospital yesterday (October 23). Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient is now in stable condition and is being arranged for treatment in a mosquito-free environment.

 Since the patient stayed in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region during her incubation period, the CHP considered that she was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of the Mainland.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 44 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. Among which, a patient passed away, while conditions of other patients are mild.

Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Dengue fever

From October 17 to yesterday (October 23), the CHP recorded one imported DF case. The patient had travelled to Yunfu in Guangdong Province during the incubation period.

As of yesterday, 50 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. From January to July 2025, over 4 million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths have been reported in 97 countries/territories.

DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 40 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 500 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded 2 181 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 383 cases were recorded in a week between October 6 to 12, with the highest number of cases recorded in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chaozhou, Jiangmen and Dongguan.

Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients of DF and CF, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and reminds cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
反非法勞工行動拘十六人（附圖）,2025-10-24 19:24,2025-10-24 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400622.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十月十七日至昨日（十月二十三日）在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，包括「滙力行動」、「光影行動」、「銳破行動」以及聯同香港警務處執行的「冠軍行動」。截至昨日（十月二十三日），行動中共拘捕十一名懷疑非法勞工、四名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及一名協助及教唆者。

入境處調查人員發現近日有內地攝影師利用社交媒體宣傳，聲稱可來港提供攝影及化妝服務。調查人員經過情報分析和深入調查後鎖定部分可疑人士，並展開行動，以「放蛇」手法於社交平台上喬裝成顧客，向涉嫌來港非法工作的內地攝影師及化妝師查詢及預訂有關服務，其後於他們來港提供攝影服務時將其拘捕。被捕的五名懷疑非法勞工為三男兩女，年齡介乎二十至二十九歲。

另外，反非法勞工行動中調查人員亦搜查了多個目標地點，包括餐廳、住宅大廈及建築地盤等，共拘捕六名懷疑非法勞工、四名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及一名協助及教唆者。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為兩男四女，年齡介乎二十四至四十七歲。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為兩男兩女，年齡介乎三十六至六十二歲。此外，被捕的協助及教唆者為一名五十六歲女子。

有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

16 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photo),2025-10-24 19:24,2025-10-24 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400642.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Rally"", ""Lightshadow"", ""Puncture"", and a joint operation with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Champion"", from October 17 to yesterday (October 23). As of yesterday (October 23), atotal of 11 suspected illegal workers, four suspected employers and a suspected aider and abettor were arrested.

  ImmD officers found that social media platforms have recently been utilised by Mainland photographers to advertise photography and makeup services in Hong Kong. After an in-depth investigation and intelligence analysis, ImmD officers identified several suspected persons and initiated an operation. Officers disguised themselves as customers to enquire about and book photography and makeup services from these Mainland photographers and makeup artists. They were subsequently arrested while providing photography and makeup services in Hong Kong. The five arrested illegal workers comprised three men and two women, aged 20 to 29.

  During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers also raided multiple target locations including restaurants, residential buildings and construction sites, etc. Six suspected illegal workers, four suspected employers and a suspected aider and abettor were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised two men and four women, aged 24 to 47. Two men and two women, aged 36 to 62, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested. Furthermore, the suspected aider and abettor arrested was a women aged 56.

  Investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. ""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."

為提高季節性流感疫苗接種率，中心今年提早於六月初開始接受學校報名參加計劃。在政府和社會各界（包括醫療界和學校等）的共同努力下，目前已有約2 300間學校（總數的99%）會舉行流感疫苗學校外展活動，當中約1 350間學校（59%）會於本月底或之前進行外展活動，而約2 190間學校（95%）則會於下月（十一月）底或之前進行，分別較去年的45%和83%為高。總括而言，今年學校外展活動普遍將早於上一季度完成。

開學至今，已有約930間學校已舉行季節性流感疫苗學校外展活動，較上一季度同期約650間為高。因應今年夏季流感的出現，加上近期的流感活躍程度和學校爆發宗數上升，中心在十月中旬已積極聯繫相關學校，敦促他們在可行的情況下，嘗試進一步提早接種疫苗的外展活動服務。現時有23間學校近日已應中心呼籲，將原訂於今年十二月或明年一月舉行疫苗接種活動學校，提前至下月底前舉行疫苗接種活動。

中心十分感謝學校及醫療機構的合作以提前舉行疫苗接種活動，並明白參與計劃的學校在安排外展活動時，需考慮校曆、人手安排等不同客觀因素，與參與計劃的醫療團隊協商合適的時間進行。倘若學校有意提前外展活動而遇有任何困難，可於辦公時間內致電中心（電話：3975 4872），中心會全力提供協助。

疫苗供應時間受制於藥商的生產時間
————————————————

世界衞生組織（世衞）一般在每年二至三月公布北半球的季節性流感病毒株，世界各地的藥廠其後會依據世衞的公布，製造合適的疫苗，供各界訂購。由於生產和運輸需時，按經驗，一般最快要九至十月才能運送到不同國家或地區。過去兩年，中心一直積極同藥廠商討，以期盡早接收疫苗。今年，中心約九月中接收到疫苗。

中心會繼續密切留意國際間疫苗的供應和計劃的實施情況，致力確保疫苗供應穩定和提升計劃的靈活性，以滿足不同群體的接種需求，更好保障公眾健康。"

Launching ceremony of second-term Care Teams held today (with photos),2025-10-24 19:00,2025-10-24 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400608.htm,"âThe Home Affairs Department (HAD) today (October 24) held a launching ceremony for the second-term District Services & Community Care Teams (Care Teams) at the Central Government Offices. The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, accompanied by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, officiated at the ceremony.

At the launching ceremony, Mr Lee said that when he ran in the Chief Executive Election in 2022, he proposed in his election manifesto to set up Care Teams in the 18 districts. Care Teams had already become an integral part of the Government's efforts to improve district governance. Under the enhanced district governance structure, the District Councils, the ""three district committees"", and Care Teams each have well-defined roles while maintaining close co-ordination and synergy in helping those in need. This governance structure enables the Government services to be rooted in the community, reach out to the public and accurately and effectively provide relief measures and solutions. Each Care Team actively provided and organised caring and community activities, reached out and helped the underprivileged, disseminated government information, and assisted the Government in providing relief in times of incidents and emergencies. Mr Lee said the Care Teams serve without seeking reward and without fear of hardship, embodying the spirit of care and compassion.

To further support the work of Care Teams, the Government has set up three additional Care Teams in accordance with district needs and enhanced the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the second-term of service, enabling Care Teams to provide services and activities better tailored to district needs. Under a regularised mode of operation and with increased government funding, the second-term service of Care Teams will further extend the community support network. The Government will also enhance training for Care Teams and facilitate them to strengthen ties and co-operation with government departments, public utilities and district organisations. Mr Lee expressed his hope that the Care Teams would continue to carry forward the spirit and strength of unity, mutual support, resilience and inclusiveness.

Other officiating guests included the Under Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Mr Clarence Leung, and the Director of Home Affairs, Ms Priscilla To. District Officers of the 18 districts, who are the commanders of Care Teams in their districts, and the representative of all 455 Care Teams also attended the ceremony.

The first-term of Care Team services has completed and all KPIs have been met. Care Teams have made around 610 000 visits to elderly households and other households in need, provided close to 100 000 times of basic home or other support services, organised around 50 000 district-level activities, and their achievements are evident to all.The HAD and District Offices will consolidate the reports of the Care Teams in the first term and let the public know their achievements.

The second-term service of Care Teams will run till September 30, 2027. Building on the established district networks, Care Teams will continue to deepen and broaden their services to further enhance people's sense of satisfaction and well-being."

The theme for this year is ""A Decade of Collaboration Drives Energy Transitions for a Green Future "". At the High-level Dialogue Session titled ""Building a Forward-Looking Framework for Global Clean Energy Cooperation"", Mr Tse shared Hong Kong's strategies and progress in promoting regional energy collaboration.

Mr Tse introduced to the attendees the four major decarbonisation strategies outlined by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in the Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050, namely net-zero electricity generation, energy saving and green buildings, green transport, and waste reduction, leading Hong Kong towards carbon neutrality.

  ""In terms of net-zero electricity generation, Hong Kong has gradually phased out coal for daily electricity generation since 1997 and aims to increase the share of zero-carbon energy in the fuel mix for electricity generation to about 60 per cent. We are also committed to measures such as ceasing new registration of fuel-propelled private cars before 2035 and moving away from the reliance on landfills for municipal solid waste management, aiming to achieve a 50 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2035 and carbon neutrality before 2050,"" Mr Tse said.

He also mentioned that the HKSAR formulated the Strategy of Hydrogen Development in Hong Kong last year to seize the opportunities brought about by the global development of hydrogen energy and create an environment conducive to the development of hydrogen energy in Hong Kong in a prudent and orderly manner. He said that he was looking forward to continuing to strengthen communication and collaboration with all parties involved in the development of new energy.

Mr Tse added that, Hong Kong, as the world's third-most competitive international financial centre and international centre for green and sustainable finance, can become a hub for green technologies and products, and provide professional services for green development worldwide to work together to promote regional low-carbon green transformation.

After the meeting, Mr Tse signed the Cooperation Arrangement on Promoting Interconnectivity of Charging Facilities in the Greater Bay Area with Deputy Administrator of the National Energy Administration of China Mr Song Hongkun.

Under the Arrangement, the Environment and Ecology Bureau and the NEA will establish a joint working group to develop a roadmap for the demonstration project of the new electric vehicle charging technology, called ChaoJi, in Hong Kong and confirm the implementation details, which include conducting technical discussions with experts on the research, development, and certification of relevant adapters, as well as preparing for the next stage of work.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, Mr Tse said, ""By collaborating with the National Energy Administration to implement the Arrangement, the introduction of a pilot scheme in Hong Kong using the ChaoJi charging standard will help the HKSAR to address the issue of different electric vehicle charging standards between the two places in the long run, promote the construction of supporting infrastructure for new energy vehicles, and enhance the interconnectivity and green low-carbon transportation development in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, as well as to showcase the technical standard advantages of ChaoJi to the world, aiding the global advancement of China's electric vehicle technology and charging standards.

Mr Tse will return to Hong Kong tomorrow (October 25)."

Mr Chung (Deputy Minister of the International Legal Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea, Mr Chung Hong-sik), Mr Jeong (Executive Director of the Trade Promotion Group of the Korea International Trade Association, Mr Jeong Hee-cheol), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is my great honour and pleasure to welcome you all to the 2nd Joint Legal Workshop organised by the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea, the Department of Justice of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, the Korea International Trade Association and the Korea In-House Counsel Association. Our theme today is ""Strengthening Business and Legal Cooperation: Korea and Hong Kong"". Building on the success of our first legal workshop held in Hong Kong in July last year, this event marks a significant step forward in our ongoing partnership.

Korea has always been a close partner of Hong Kong. In 2024, Korea was Hong Kong's fifth largest trading partner. The total merchandise trade between Hong Kong and Korea reached HK$355.9 billion in 2024, representing a nearly 20 per cent increase from the previous year. This reflects the deepening economic exchanges and expanding opportunities between our two regions.

To facilitate these increasing exchanges and the exploration of these opportunities, and to safeguard the rights and interests of all relevant stakeholders, it is plain and obvious that reliable, high-quality and user-friendly legal and dispute resolution services are indispensable. This is precisely what Hong Kong may and can offer.

Under the fundamental principle of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction in the People's Republic of China. It is also the only bilingual common law jurisdiction in the world using both English and Chinese. We have an independent judiciary with the power of final adjudication, business-friendly civil and commercial laws familiar to the international community, and a large pool of lawyers with extensive international experience and expertise in different areas. These legal professionals provide seamless, one-stop services across a wide range of matters covering the whole business cycle, from the formation of a business entity (including the raising of capital by public listing) to the realisation of profits derived from a business venture.

Fair and efficient dispute resolution services constitute an essential component of risk management. Apart from traditional litigations, alternative dispute resolution including arbitration and mediation have become increasingly important in international trade and investment. Hong Kong has all along been well regarded as one of the top international arbitration centres in the world. According to the 2025 International Arbitration Survey conducted by Queen Mary University of London, Hong Kong ranks as the second most preferred seat for arbitration globally and the first in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2024, 76.4 per cent of the arbitrations submitted to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre were international in nature.

Turning to mediation, the establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong demonstrates the city's unique advantages and opportunities in international mediation. The IOMed is the world's first intergovernmental international legal organisation dedicated to resolving international disputes, including disputes between a country and another country, a country and foreign nationals, as well as international commercial disputes, through mediation. The headquarters of IOMed has been established in Hong Kong, and IOMed formally opened a few days ago on October 20. We are also excited to share the news that we will construct the Hong Kong International Legal Service Building, adjacent to the IOMed headquarters, to house international legal and dispute resolution services institutions so as to further support Hong Kong's strategic position as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution.

A unique and significant advantage enjoyed by Hong Kong is its close connection with the legal system in the Chinese Mainland. Up to the present, Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland have signed nine mutual legal assistance arrangements, including mutual recognition and enforcement of civil and commercial judgments as well as arbitral awards; and the grant of interim measures in arbitrations, which is extremely useful in practice. All in all, Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services may be conveniently used to facilitate the exploitation of investment and business opportunities in the Chinese Mainland. This is why we say Hong Kong indeed serves as a gateway between China and the rest of the world.

Looking ahead, the Department of Justice is eager to continue building on the strong foundation of partnership we have with Korea. On this basis, I would like to take the opportunity to invite all of you to join us at our annual flagship event — Hong Kong Legal Week 2025 — which will be held from December 1 to 5, 2025, in Hong Kong.

Last but not least, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to our co-organisers of the workshop, the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea, the Korea International Trade Association and the Korea In-House Counsel Association for their efforts in making this workshop possible; and, of course, all our distinguished speakers who will share their valuable insights in the two panel discussions. I wish you all a very productive and inspiring session ahead. Thank you."

The total estimated market value was about $1.77 million. The two passengers concerned were both convicted and sentenced to 10 weeks' imprisonment by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (October 24) for contravening the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO) (Cap. 60). All the pharmaceutical products were confiscated.

Customs officers intercepted the two male passengers, both aged 28, on September 20 at the Arrival Hall at HKIA for Customs clearance. Upon examination, the pharmaceutical injections were found inside their respective personal baggage.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds the public not to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong.

Under the IEO, any person who imports pharmaceutical products and medicines without a valid import licence commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
