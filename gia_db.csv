CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as severe paediatric influenza infection case reported,2026-02-15 20:34,2026-02-15 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/15/P2026021500669.htm,"​The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (February 15) recorded a severe paediatric influenza infection case, the fifth case this year. The CHP reiterated its reminder to parents to arrange for their children to receive a free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly. The SIV remains one of the most effective methods of preventing influenza and its complications and can reduce the risk of serious complications or death from infection.

The case involves a 15-year-old boy with underlying diseases. On February 12, he developed a fever. He was sent to theAccident and Emergency Department of Caritas Medical Centre the following day (February 13) due to persistent fever and was admitted on the same day. He subsequently developed desaturation and shock, and was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit of Princess Margaret Hospital for further treatment today because of worsening conditions. His respiratory specimen tested positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis is influenza A infection complicated with pneumonia and heart failure. He is currently in serious condition.

A preliminary investigation revealed that the boy has not yet received the 2025/26 SIV. He is a resident of a special school. A recent influenza outbreak was recorded in his school dormitory. The CHP staff has conducted site visit and advised the school to strengthen a series of infection control measures. Chemoprophylaxis against influenza was given to unaffected students and staff. The boy's family members are asymptomatic. The CHP's investigation is ongoing.

So far this year, five severe paediatric influenza cases have been recorded, involving children aged between 6 months and 15 years old. Three of the affected children had not received an SIV, including one case who received the 2025/26 SIV only three days before the onset of illness. As the patient was not protected by the vaccine, the case is not counted as being vaccinated. During the summer influenza season ending in early January, 25 severe paediatric influenza cases were recorded, including three fatal cases and involving children aged between 6 months to 17 years old. Among them, 20 cases (80 per cent) had not received an SIV (including one case who received the 2025/26 SIV only four days before the onset of illness).

​""Although the influenza activity in Hong Kong is currently at a low, influenza activity still remains at a relatively high level in many popular travel destinations for Hong Kong citizens, such as some areas in North America and Europe. Moreover, the overall influenza activity has increased again in Korea and Japan recently, with the major circulating virus strain having changed from the earlier influenza A (H3) to influenza B. With the increase in cross-border travel and the number of incoming visitors in the Chinese New Year, the risk of influenza transmission will also increase. Moreover, based on past experience, Hong Kong's winter influenza season typically occurs in the first quarter. With the persistent cold weather and the possibility of a change in circulating virus strains, it cannot be ruled out that the influenza activity will increase again later. Receiving SIV is still one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of hospitalisation and death from infection. The public should receive vaccination as soon as possible regardless of staying locally or planning to travel abroad, as it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body for sufficient protection against the influenza virus. All individuals aged 6 months or older, except those with known contraindications, should act promptly if they have not yet received an SIV, including those who contracted influenza in the past few months, in order to safeguard personal health,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""Recently, outbreaks of influenza continue to occur in schools. For children who did not join the SIV School Outreach Programme, parents should promptly bring their children toprivate doctorsenrolled in the Vaccination Subsidy Scheme to receive an SIV. In addition, the SIV coverage rate for children aged 6 months to under 2 years is only about 25 per cent. Although this represents an approximate 2 percentage point increase compared to the same period last year, it is still much lower than that of other age groups. Through the Primary Healthcare Commission, the CHP has urged family doctors to assist in encouraging parents to allow their children to receive an SIV,"" Dr Tsui added.

He also reminded members of the public that, especially for children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, they should seek medical advice promptly for early treatment if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

​衞生防護中心錄得一宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2026-02-15 19:45,2026-02-15 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/15/P2026021500641.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（二月十五日）接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案，是今年第五宗。中心再次提醒家長應盡快安排子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗。接種流感疫苗仍然是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的15歲男童。他於二月十二日出現發燒，翌日（二月十三日）因持續發燒被送到明愛醫院急症室，同日入院治理。他其後出現血含氧量下降及休克，今日因情況惡化而轉到瑪嘉烈醫院兒童深切治療部接受進一步治療。他的呼吸道樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發肺炎及心臟衰竭，目前情況嚴重。

初步調查顯示，男童沒有接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗。他為一名特殊學校的宿生，他的學校宿舍最近出現流感爆發，中心人員已到該校進行視察，並建議校方加強一系列感染控制措施及向未受影響的學生及職員派發抗流感預防藥物。男童的家庭成員沒有出現病徵。中心正繼續調查。

今年至今已錄得五宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎六個月至15歲，其中三宗沒有接種季節性流感疫苗（包括一宗個案在發病前三天才接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗，由於患者未能受到疫苗保護，因此個案被視為未接種疫苗）。而在一月初結束的夏季流感季節，共錄得25宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括三宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎六個月至17歲。當中，20宗（80%）個案沒有接種季節性流感疫苗（包括一宗個案在發病前四天才接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗）。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港流感活躍程度目前雖然處於低水平，但在不少港人外遊的熱門目的地，季節性流感活躍程度仍處於相對高水平，例如北美洲和歐洲部分地區，而韓國與日本的整體流感活動近日亦再度回升，當地的主要流行病毒從早前的甲型（H3）流感轉為乙型流感。農曆新年跨境旅遊與訪港旅客增加，流感傳播的風險亦會上升。此外，根據過往經驗，香港冬季流感季節大多於第一季出現。天氣持續寒冷，而且流行的病毒株可能出現變化，不排除流感活躍程度稍後會再上升。接種季節性流感疫苗仍然是最有效預防季節性流感及其併發症的方法，亦可減低入院及死亡風險。市民無論留港度歲或計劃外遊，都應及早接種疫苗，因為接種疫苗後身體約需兩星期產生抗體，以對流感病毒提供足夠保護作用。所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗應盡早接種，包括在過去幾個月曾感染流感的人士，以保障個人健康。」

徐樂堅醫生補充：「學校的流感爆發個案近期仍然發生，如果學童沒有參加季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃，家長應盡快帶子女到參加疫苗資助計劃的私家醫生接種季節性流感疫苗。此外，六個月至未滿兩歲的幼兒的季節性流感疫苗接種率只有約25%，雖然較上一季度同期上升約兩個百分點，但仍遠低於其他年齡組別的接種率。中心已經透過基層醫療署呼籲家庭醫生，協助鼓勵家長讓子女接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-15 17:30,2026-02-15 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/15/P2026021500479.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 15), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere is currently in the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.
	

The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

​
The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-02-15 17:30,2026-02-15 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/15/P2026021500477.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（二月十五日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球正值冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
