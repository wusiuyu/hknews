問題：

據報於去年推出的積金易平台持續收到投訴，包括平台的熱線電話經常無人接聽，用戶只能留下口訊或透過電郵查詢。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉積金易平台推出至今，分別收到多少宗僱主及強制性公積金計劃成員的投訴，並按投訴類別（包括註冊困難、未能查閱登記情況及供款金額、供款未有於戶口顯示、處理供款過程繁複、難以更改或更新資料，以及客戶服務效率欠佳等）以表列出分項數字及該等投訴的平均處理時間；
（二）是否知悉目前積金易平台處理投訴的人手編制為何，以及有否計劃增加人手或採取其他措施以更有效地處理投訴；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及
（三）鑑於有意見指出積金易平台處理投訴的時間過長，至今有多少宗投訴個案未能於所訂服務標準時限（即12個工作天內）完成處理，以及其未能達標的原因分別為何？

答覆：

主席：

積金易平台（平台）旨在將強制性公積金（強積金）計劃行政工作標準化、精簡化和自動化，從而提升運作效率、減省行政成本、推動減費，並為管理強積金帳戶提供更多便利。就問題的各部分，經諮詢強制性公積金計劃管理局（積金局）後，現綜合答覆如下。

積金易平台於去年六月推出，至今已有10名受託人管理的17個強積金計劃加入平台，合共佔強積金總資產值約百分之四十三。自推出以來，積金易平台的運作大致暢順，截至今年九月底，平台已處理超過160萬宗包括供款及提取強積金等不同類型的行政指示。

在平台啓用初期，有僱主及計劃成員在使用平台時遇到困難，包括透過臉容識別技術註冊帳戶時出現問題、付款指示有欠清晰、標記供款及識別自願性供款需時較長以致未及在成員帳戶中顯示等。

政府十分關注這些情況，並已責成積金局和積金易平台有限公司（積金易公司），必須迅速處理相關查詢和投訴，積極為僱主及計劃成員提供適切和及時的支援，以確保計劃成員的強積金資產得到充分保障，以及享有良好的用戶體驗。已採取的措施包括委派專人協助相關僱主盡快掌握平台的具體操作；在常設的查詢熱線之外，額外設立供款查詢專線，方便僱主或僱員查詢供款資料；加強承辦商員工培訓及強化特殊個案的通報機制；在平台上提供更清晰的供款指引，以及在確保用戶個人資料安全的大前提下，調整臉容識別軟件以簡化註冊積金易平台的流程。

積金易公司就平台提供的服務均設有服務承諾，在處理熱線查詢及留言方面，平台職員一般會在兩分鐘內接聽熱線查詢，以及於下一個工作天內回覆熱線語音留言。至於處理投訴及書面查詢，一般情況下，平台職員會在三個工作天內確認收到投訴或書面查詢，並於12個工作天內作出回覆。有關詳情亦已載於積金易公司的官方網站，以便公眾參考。

積金易平台自去年六月啓用至今年九月底，一共接獲約2 400宗投訴個案，有關個案類別載列於附表。超過九成的個案能於服務承諾的時限內作出回覆，一般處理時間約為10至12個工作天。餘下少數未能於12個工作天內作出回覆的個案，主要是由於個案較為複雜，例如涉及投訴人在其所屬計劃加入平台前向受託人所作的行政指示，因此需要較長時間處理。政府已要求積金局和積金易公司密切監察承辦商在處理投訴方面的服務水平，確保所有投訴均獲適切處理。為此，積金易公司近日亦設立了追蹤表現系統，持續監察平台的營運數據及就重要程序加設提示，提醒承辦商職員在指定時限內完成處理僱主和計劃成員作出的指示。

在人手方面，承辦商已於過去三個月增加超過六成人手專責處理積金易相關的查詢和投訴，由六月底約500名職員增加至九月底超過800名職員，並會在今年年底前進一步增添人手至超過1 100名，即於半年間大幅增加人手超過一倍，以持續提升用戶體驗，以及為應對較大型受託人即將加入積金易平台作好準備。與此同時，積金局及積金易公司已敦促承辦商必須持續優化投訴處理機制，已落實的措施包括安排客服職員專責跟進個案，並與投訴人保持緊密聯絡、優化前線職員使用的系統介面，以及為職員提供適當培訓等，以加快處理投訴個案。政府、積金局及積金易公司會繼續密切監察積金易平台的投訴處理機制，務求為僱主及計劃成員提供更優質的客戶服務。

多謝主席。"
LCQ4: eMPF Platform,2025-10-22 14:40,2025-10-22 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200439.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Holden Chow and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

  It has been reported that complaints have been received continuously against the eMPF Platform since its launch last year, including cases in which calls to its hotline were frequently unanswered and users had no alternative but to leave voicemails or submit enquiries via email. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the respective numbers of complaints received from employers and Mandatory Provident Fund scheme members against the eMPF Platform since it has been launched, with a tabulated breakdown of the numbers of complaints and their average processing time by type of complaints (including difficulties in registration, failure to access enrolment status and contribution records, failure to show contribution records in user accounts, complicated procedures for handling contributions, difficulties in changing or updating information, and inefficient customer services, etc.);

(2) whether it knows the current staffing establishment of the eMPF Platform for handling complaints, and whether there are plans to increase manpower or take alternative measures to handle complaints more effectively; if there are plans, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views pointing out that it takes excessively long time for the eMPF Platform to handle complaints, of the number of complaint cases which have not been resolved within the stipulated timeframe under its service delivery standards (i.e. within 12 working days) so far and the respective reasons for failing to meet the standards?

Reply:

President,

  The eMPF Platform (the Platform) seeks to standardise, streamline, and automate Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) scheme administration work, thereby enhancing operational efficiency, reducing administrative costs, driving fee reduction, and providing greater convenience in managing MPF accounts. In consultation with the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA), our consolidated reply to the various parts of the question is as follows.

  Since the launch of the eMPF Platform last June, 17 MPF schemes administered by 10 trustees have onboarded the Platform, altogether accounting for roughly 43 per cent of the total MPF assets-under-management. Since its launch, the eMPF Platform's operation has been largely smooth. As at end-September this year, the Platform has processed over 1.6 million administrative instructions of various types, including making MPF contributions and withdrawals.

  During the initial launch phase of the Platform, some employers and scheme members encountered difficulties in using the Platform, including issues with account registration through facial recognition technology, unclear payment instructions, and delays in tagging payments and identifying voluntary contributions resulting in contributions not being timely reflected in members' accounts, etc.

  The Government is highly concerned about these situations, and has already instructed that the MPFA and the eMPF Platform Company Limited (eMPF Company) must promptly address the relevant enquiries and complaints and proactively offer appropriate and timely support to employers and scheme members, so as to ensure the full protection of scheme members' MPF assets and their positive user experience. Measures already implemented include assigning dedicated officers to help the employers concerned to familiarise with the Platform's specific operation as soon as possible; setting up a contribution inquiry hotline in addition to the existing enquiry hotline to facilitate employers or employees in checking contribution information; strengthening the contractor's staff training and enhancing the reporting mechanism for exceptional cases; providing clearer guidelines on contributions on the Platform; and refining the facial recognition software to simplify the eMPF Platform registration process under the premise of ensuring the safety of users' personal data.

  The eMPF Company has set service pledges in respect of services provided by the Platform. In handling hotline enquiries and messages, the Platform staff will in general answer hotline enquiries within two minutes and return hotline voicemail messages within the next working day. As regards the handling of complaints and written enquiries, under general circumstances, the Platform staff will acknowledge receipt of complaints or written enquiries within three working days and issue replies within 12 working days. The relevant details have also been uploaded onto eMPF Company's official website for public reference.

  From its launch last June to end-September this year, the eMPF Platform received a total of about 2 400 complaint cases. The relevant case categories are set out at Annex. Over 90 per cent of the cases were issued with replies within the timeframe stipulated in the service pledges, taking an average processing time of about 10 to 12 working days. The remaining few cases could not be addressed within 12 working days mainly due to their complexity, such as those involving administrative instructions submitted to trustees by the complainants prior to the onboarding of their schemes, hence requiring more time to process. The Government has already requested the MPFA and eMPF Company to closely monitor the contractor's service standard in handling complaints to ensure proper handling of all complaints. To this end, the eMPF Company has recently implemented a performance tracking system to continuously monitor the Platform's operation statistics and to introduce alerts on critical processes, reminding the contractor's staff to complete the processing of instructions made by employers and scheme members within the specified timeframe.

  On manpower, the contractor has already increased its headcounts dedicated to handling eMPF-related enquiries and complaints by over 60 per cent in the past three months (from about 500 staff as at end-June to over 800 staff as at end-September), and will further increase its headcounts to over 1 100 by end of this year, representing a substantial increase in headcounts by more than a double within half a year which seeks to continuously enhance user experience and prepare for the imminent onboarding of larger-sized trustees to the eMPF Platform. Meanwhile, the MPFA and the eMPF Company have already urged that the contractor must continuously refine the complaint handling mechanism. Measures already implemented include arranging dedicated customer service staff to follow up on cases and maintain close communication with complainants, enhancing the system interface used by frontline staff, and providing appropriate staff training, etc, so as to expedite the processing of complaint cases. The Government, the MPFA and eMPF Company will continue to closely monitor the complaint handling mechanism of the eMPF Platform, with a view to providing employers and scheme members with customer services of higher quality.

  Thank you President."
立法會：環境及生態局局長就「改革滲水問題處理機制」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-10-22 14:37,2025-10-22 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200446.htm,"以下是環境及生態局局長謝展寰今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議就陳恒鑌議員動議的「改革滲水問題處理機制」議案的開場發言：

（代）主席：

我感謝陳恒鑌議員提出的議案，讓政府有機會與大家在立法會討論樓宇滲水處理機制。我會就行政長官《施政報告》內有關善用調解去處理滲水糾紛，和優化處理樓宇滲水的先導計劃作出介紹。接著署理發展局局長會講解有關樓宇維修和滲水的問題。

樓宇滲水主要原因是樓宇結構或設備損壞，而業主有責任妥善維修保養物業，包括解決滲水問題。由食物環境衞生署（食環署）和屋宇署聯合成立的滲水投訴調查聯合辦事處，下稱聯辦處，旨在處理樓宇滲水投訴個案，提供一站式服務。在現時聯辦處的架構下，屋宇署人員負責運用其在樓宇維修方面的專業知識找出滲水源頭，並可根據《建築物條例》和《水務設施條例》處理相關的滲水情況。食環署人員則按《公眾衞生及市政條例》處理公共衞生妨擾事故，兩署人員合作處理滲水個案。

推動協商和調解

政府近年大力推動涉事業主之間以協商和調解方式解決滲水糾紛。我留意到在過去三年，經由物管公司通過調解、協商或為屋苑公用地方進行改善工程等方法而得以成功解決的滲水個案佔約七成之多，效果顯著。所以食環署推出了物業管理公司協助處理住宅樓宇滲水計劃，現時已有超過200間屋苑的物管公司參加計劃。在計劃下，物管公司會協調及建議住戶透過調解或民事方式處理滲水問題。

此外，環境及生態局和食環署聯同律政司已於今年七月推出社區調解先導計劃，為物管人員提供全日制調解技巧培訓，協助他們更有效處理滲水個案。

優化滲水檢測程序先導計劃

另外，為促使業主盡快履行其妥善維修物業的責任，行政長官在今年《施政報告》宣布，聯辦處將於二○二六年上半年推出先導計劃，優化處理樓宇滲水問題的檢測程序。在先導計劃下，聯辦處會採用紅外線測試以加快甄別滲水源頭。若結果顯示滲水高於指明濕度值，會向上層單位業主發出「建議維修通知」，要求涉事業主在指定時間內自行檢查和維修。就較簡單直接的個案，我們預計向引致滲水的單位業主發出通知所需時間可大幅減至約14個工作天。

如業主逾期未有行動而滲水持續，聯辦處會展開科技檢測，甄別滲水源頭，並向業主收回檢查費用。聯辦處會評估新檢測程序的成效，以及持續檢視可應用在滲水調查的工具。聯辦處更會把以往的第二和第三階段調查改為同步進行，從而精簡程序，提升效率。

我們預計藉着推動協商／調解和先導計劃下收回檢查費用的安排，應可有效減少需要由聯辦處進行檢控調查的個案數目。我們和發展局會持續檢視檢測程序，加快處理樓宇滲水問題。

修訂法例以加強調查和阻嚇力

另一方面，為便利食環署處理樓宇滲水導致公共衞生妨擾個案，我們修訂了《公眾衞生及市政條例》（第132章），訂明單位業戶如無合理辯解而不遵從「擬進入處所通知書」，即屬罪行。《修訂條例》亦延長了政府人員可登門調查的時段至下午十時，以更好地配合市民的生活，便利進行調查。這些修訂已在今年八月生效。

（代）主席，我會細心聆聽議員就議案的發言，並會在稍後總結發言時再作回應。我現交由署理發展局局長發言。謝謝（代）主席。"
立法會二十題：降低企業的合規成本,2025-10-22 14:15,2025-10-22 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200318.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上周文港議員的提問和創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，香港企業（特別是中小企）的經營成本高企，其中部分行業須負擔較為沉重的合規成本。就降低企業的合規成本，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據報近年食物環境衞生署簡化食物業牌照發牌制度，其中擴大「專業核證制度」的適用範圍至普通食肆牌照申請已實施超過一年，當局有否統計，去年二月至今，選擇以該制度進行的申請宗數和其佔同期所有食肆牌照申請宗數的百分比，以及申請不獲批准的宗數和其原因分別為何；

（二）鑑於有意見認為，繁複的發展審批程序會導致建築成本增加，亦會間接加重租金等營運成本，影響各行各業的發展，就此發展局已實施逾百項精簡發展程序措施，並會於今年內陸續落實其他新措施，當局有否（i）評估已實施措施的成效（尤其是在壓縮發展期及成本方面）、（ii）就該等措施制訂績效指標、（iii）設立恆常機制與業界溝通，以及（iv）為擬落實的其他新措施（包括今年《施政報告》宣布就北部都會區發展所引入的快速審批制度）制訂具體時間表；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）有否計劃加強調研各行各業（包括但不限於零售、飲食及運輸業）及不同規模的企業所面對的合規成本問題，以探討如何精簡政府各部門的規管制度（例如發牌機制，以及就處所或土地的使用限制），從而拆牆鬆綁，優化營商環境，並進一步促進本地經濟及提升企業競爭力；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就周文港議員的提問，經諮詢各有關決策局後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）為加快審批和讓業界更易掌握發牌時間，食物環境衞生署（食環署）自二○二三年三月起，以小食食肆和食物製造廠牌照為試點，引入「專業核證制度」，為申請正式牌照提供「先發牌、後審查」的額外選項，並由二○二四年二月起把制度推展至普通食肆牌照。相比原有制度，申請人可提前約14日取得正式牌照。

由二○二四年二月至二○二五年九月，有八宗食物業牌照申請選用「專業核證制度」，至今五宗已獲批，一宗仍在處理，另有兩宗及後轉用原有制度並已發牌；同期食物業牌照申請宗數為4 742宗。

（二）發展局一直致力精簡發展管制程序，為發展業界提速、提效，並降低成本。發展局於二○一八年成立「精簡發展管制督導小組」，統籌各決策局及部門（局／部門）檢視發展管制程序，並制定各項精簡措施。及後，為促進局／部門間精簡程序的機構文化，發展局於二○二四年七月發出通告，臚列指導原則及良好作業方式，並明文要求審批部門以「促進者」思維處理發展申請。

為落實通告要求，除了約100項經已實施的精簡措施，局／部門在二○二四年第三季起至二○二五年年底，陸續研究或實施約80項新措施，從而精簡發展管制程序。這些措施涵蓋範疇正正包括為審批程序的不同環節訂立指標（例如訂立審批時間承諾等），亦包括推動自行認證、引進更多分階段提交資料的安排等。這約80項新措施中，約60項已經實施，其餘的措施亦預計於二○二五年年底前推出。

另外，為加快北部都會區（北都）建設，行政長官於二○二五年《施政報告》中亦宣布推出一系列措施，當中不少涉及精簡發展管制程序，例如我們將訂立「加快發展北都」專屬法例，授權政府簡化法定程序，二○二六年初會就立法建議進行兩個月諮詢，二○二六年年中左右向立法會提交條例草案以期二○二六年年底前通過。二○二五年《施政報告》亦提到，發展局會為大型發展工程設立制度，簡化工程審批，訂立清晰服務時間承諾，並加強統籌相關部門的審批流程，加快審批。具體而言，政府工程項目會由發展局項目策略及管控處負責；北都的私人發展項目由特設專案監督辦公室處理；北都以外則由發展局項目促進辦事處負責。我們的目標是在二○二五年年底前推出操作細節。

由於精簡措施各有不同性質，而每個發展項目亦有其獨特性並涉及不同程度的審批，我們難以籠統在此羅列所有措施對降低成本和加快發展的正面影響。然而，精簡發展程序時我們會着重果效，如適合的話會量化效益並公開指標。舉例來說，發展局將於二○二五年十一月初推出新措施，私人發展項目在地面興建不多於兩層停車場，可全數豁免總樓面面積。我們估計相比在地庫興建停車場，以興建兩層地面停車場為例，施工時間可望縮短超過一年，建築成本亦會減低約四成。

發展局將會繼續透過不同渠道，例如發展局土地及建設諮詢委員會轄下的精簡發展管制聯合小組委員會，以及直接與團體會面，積極諮詢業界，研究和推展不同精簡發展管制程序的措施。

（三）政府致力持續優化營商環境。其中一項措施是透過方便營商諮詢委員會，為政府提供平台，就規管建議諮詢商界，並向業界推廣方便營商措施。「營商諮詢電子平台」亦協助政府部門收集業界對規管制度的意見。此外，各局／部門亦會持續應用創新科技，及善用中央資訊科技平台和服務，例如「智方便」和構建中的「數碼企業身份」平台，提供一站式便利的電子政府服務及精簡流程，以及推出相關政策及措施，讓發牌制度更有效率、透明及方便營商，以降低業界的遵規成本，維持本港的競爭力。

同時，食環署一直積極簡化食肆發牌制度。二○二五年《施政報告》已公布食環署會採用新方式統籌相關部門進行「會審」和精簡程序，以加快審批食肆露天座位申請。"

Question:

  There are views that the operating costs of Hong Kong enterprises (particularly small and medium enterprises) are high, and some of these industries have to bear relatively heavy compliance costs. In terms of lowering the compliance cost of enterprises, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it has been reported that the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department has streamlined the food business licensing regime in recent years, including expanding the scope of the ""Professional Certification System"" to cover applications for general restaurant licences, which has been in effect for over a year, whether the authorities have compiled statistics on, since February last year, the number of applications made under the licensing regime, and the percentage of the number of applications in the total number of applications for restaurant licences during the same period, as well as the number of applications which were not approved and the respective reasons;

(2) given that there are views that the complicated vetting and approval procedures for development projects will lead to an increase in construction costs, which will indirectly increase operating costs such as rentals, thus affecting the development of various trades and industries, and in this connection, the Development Bureau has already implemented more than a hundred measures to streamline the development procedures and will implement other new measures one after another this year, whether the authorities have:(i) assessed the effectiveness of the measures implemented, particularly in terms of compressing the development period and costs;(ii) formulated key performance indicators; (iii) set up a regular communication mechanism with the industry in respect of such measure; and (iv) formulated a specific timetable for the other proposed new measures to be implemented (including the introduction of the Fast Track Processing System for the development of the Northern Metropolis as announced in this year's Policy Address); if so, of the details; if not, the details for that; and

(3) whether it has plans to enhance its efforts in conducting studies on the compliance cost problems faced by enterprises of various trades and industries (including but not limited to, the retail, catering, and transport industries) and of different sizes, so as to explore ways to streamline the licensing and other regulatory regimes (e.g. the licensing regime and restrictions on the use of premises or land) of various government departments, thereby removing barriers and restrictions, optimising the business environment, as well as further promoting the local economy and upgrading the competitiveness of enterprises; if it has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply

President,

In consultation with the relevant policy bureaux, the consolidated reply to the question raised by the Prof Hon Chow Man-kong is as follows:

(1) To expedite vetting and enable the trade to have a better grasp of the processing time, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) introduced the ""Professional Certification System"" (PCS) in March 2023 as a pilot scheme for light refreshment restaurants and food factories. The system offers an additional option of ""licence first, inspection later"" for full licence applications. Starting from February 2024, its coverage was extended to general restaurants. Compared with the prevailing system, applicants may obtain their full licences about 14 days earlier.

From February 2024 to September 2025, eight food business licence applications opted for the PCS. Of these, five were approved and one is under review. The remaining two later reverted to the prevailing system and were approved. During the same period, there were 4 742 food business licence applications.

(2) The Development Bureau (DEVB) has all along been striving to streamline development control procedures, so as to enhance speed and efficiency as well as reduce costs for the development trade. In 2018, the DEVB established the Steering Group on Streamlining Development Control to co-ordinate various bureaux/departments (B/Ds) in reviewing development control procedures and formulating various streamlining measures. Subsequently, to foster an institutional culture of streamlining among B/Ds, the DEVB issued a circular in July 2024, setting out guiding principles and best practices and explicitly requiring approving departments to adopt a ""facilitator"" mindset when handling development applications.

  To implement the requirements of the circular, in addition to the around 100 streamlining measures already implemented, B/Ds have been studying or implementing around 80 new measures from Q3 2024 till end-2025 to streamline development control procedures. These measures cover the very aspect of setting performance indicators (e.g. time pledges) for different stages of the approval process, as well as other aspects such as promoting self-certification, introducing more phased submission arrangements, etc. Of these around 80 new measures, around 60 have already been implemented, with the remaining measures expected to be rolled out by end-2025.

  Furthermore, to accelerate the development of the Northern Metropolis (NM), the Chief Executive announced a series of measures in the 2025 Policy Address, many of which involve streamlining development control procedures. For example, we will introduce dedicated legislation to accelerate the development of NM, empowering the government to simplify statutory procedures. We will conduct a two-month consultation exercise on the legislative proposal in early 2026 and introduce a bill to the Legislative Council around mid-2026 in a bid to have the bill passed by end-2026. The 2025 Policy Address also mentioned that the DEVB will set up mechanisms for large-scale works projects, with a view to simplifying works approval procedures, setting clear performance pledges, and enhancing co-ordination among relevant departments on vetting processes, so as to expedite approval. Specifically, the Project Strategy and Governance Office of the DEVB will be responsible for government works projects; the dedicated project supervision office will be responsible for private development projects in the NM, while the Development Projects Facilitation Office of the DEVB will be responsible for those outside the NM. Our aim is to promulgate the relevant operational details by end-2025.

  Given the varying nature of streamlining measures and that each development project has its own individuality and requires approval process of different degree, it is difficult to crudely list out the positive impact on cost reduction and expediting development cycle posed by each and every measure. Having said that, we will take an effectiveness-oriented approach when streamlining development control; and will quantify the effectiveness and publish the relevant indicators as appropriate. For example, the DEVB will introduce a new measure in early November 2025 where private development projects constructing not more than two levels of aboveground carparks may enjoy full gross floor area exemption. It is estimated that, as compared to constructing underground carparks, constructing say two levels of aboveground carparks could reduce construction time by more than one year and construction cost by around 40 per cent.

  The DEVB will continue to proactively consult the trade through various channels, such as the Joint Subcommittee on Streamlining Development Control under the DEVB's Land and Development Advisory Committee and directly meeting with relevant bodies so as to study and implement different measures to streamline development control procedures.

(3) The Government is committed to enhancing the business environment continuously. One of the measures is through the Business Facilitation Advisory Committee that provides a platform for the Government to consult the business sector on regulatory proposals and promote business friendly measures to the industry. The ""Business Consultation e-Platform"" also facilitates government departments in gathering industry feedback on regulatory framework. In addition, various B/Ds will continue to leverage innovative technologies and central information and communications technology platforms and services, such as ""iAM Smart"" and ""Digital Corporate Identity"" (CorpID) platform being developed, to deliver one-stop convenient e-Government services with streamlined procedures, and hence relevant policies and measures on a more efficient, transparent and convenient licensing regime for the trade, with a view to reducing the business compliance costs and sustaining Hong Kong's competitiveness.

  In parallel, the FEHD has been proactively streamlining the food business licensing regime. As announced in the 2025 Policy Address, FEHD will adopt a new way to expedite the vetting of applications for outside seating accommodation of restaurants by co-ordinating relevant departments to undergo ""joint-vetting"" and streamlining procedures."

立法會十一題：改善舊式樓宇的大廈管理,2025-10-22 13:15,2025-10-22 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200294.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上陳學鋒議員的提問和民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟的書面答覆：

問題：

市區重建局（市建局）與香港房屋經理學會組成的團隊在二○二二年於九龍城「龍城區」的單幢式舊樓試行「聯廈聯管」，在協助未有成立業主立案法團（法團）的舊樓成立法團後，再協調不同單幢式舊樓聘用同一物業管理公司，讓業主能以較相宜的費用獲取專業管理服務。然而，市建局於今年三月向政府提交的《九龍城區「聯廈聯管」試行經驗分享報告》中提及，「龍城區」四幢參與聯廈聯管計劃的大廈中，有一半退出計劃。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據悉不少舊樓業主均為年長退休人士，不太熱衷參與大廈管理事務，以致該等樓宇的法團運作幾近停擺，政府有何措施鼓勵舊樓業主改善大廈的管理和進行維修，例如會否讓其在無須成立法團的情況下參與「聯廈聯管」或其他資助大廈管理計劃；

（二）鑑於政府已在今年六月在油尖旺、深水埗、九龍城和荃灣推行為期一年的「聯廈聯管」試驗計劃，而據悉位於港島西的30年樓齡或以上的私人樓宇有超過5 000幢，政府會否將該試驗計劃擴展至港島西的舊式私人樓宇；若會，實施時間表為何；

（三）鑑於有地區人士表示，上月荷李活道一幢舊式綜合用途及住用建築物發生公用食水管爆裂事故，惟由部分住宅單位業主委聘的承辦商未能成功進入地鋪單位維修水管，以致整幢大廈的住宅單位沒有食水供應，政府有否統計，過去五年有多少宗因人為情況（例如相關業主拖延或不合作）而導致大廈維修工程未能及時進行的個案；若有，個案的數目及詳情為何；及

（四）鑑於政府於去年修訂《消防安全（建築物）條例》（第572章），賦權香港消防處和屋宇署代未能遵從第572章的要求的業主進行消防安全改善工程，並在工程完成後向其收回費用，而根據《建築物條例》（第123章）屋宇署亦會委聘政府承建商代業主進行緊急工程，政府會否參考第572章及第123章的做法，立法賦權水務署、機電工程署或其他政府部門，代業主處理水管或污水渠滲漏等樓宇維修個案，再向業主收取費用；若會，有關工作的時間表為何？

答覆：

主席：

大廈的管理和妥善維修是業主的責任。政府在大廈管理的角色是擔當推動者，透過《建築物管理條例》（第344章）提供法律框架，讓業主成立業主立案法團（法團），並提供一系列支援服務，協助業主共同履行管理大廈的責任。

就陳議員提問的各部分，經諮詢發展局後，現綜合回覆如下︰

（一）及（二）為加強對法團的支援，促進有效的大廈管理，民政事務總署（民政總署）自二○一八年推出「法團諮詢服務計劃」，委聘物業管理（物管）公司為有需要的法團提供免費的大廈管理諮詢服務，包括協助已停止運作或不活躍的法團管理委員會（管委會）恢復運作。對於未有成立業主組織或聘用物管公司管理的「三無大廈」，民政總署自二○二二年透過「大廈管理專業顧問服務計劃」（「專業顧問服務計劃」），委託具有大廈管理或相關經驗的地區組織接觸業主，鼓勵及協助他們成立法團；同時亦透過「居民聯絡大使」計劃，協助政府部門聯絡大廈居民，商討和處理樓宇管理工作，並推動有關大廈成立法團。

就協助法團和業主處理大廈維修等事宜方面，民政總署透過「大廈管理中央平台」，定期舉辦簡介會，邀請相關政府部門及機構，包括屋宇署、消防處、機電工程署、警務處、勞工處、廉政公署、市區重建局和競爭事務委員會，介紹各類與大廈管理及維修相關的服務和財政支援計劃。簡介會除了實體舉行，亦進行網上直播，有關視頻亦會上載到民政總署的專題網站，方便法團及業主閱覽。

民政總署和18區民政事務處（民政處）亦定期舉辦各類大廈管理的教育和宣傳活動，包括研討會、培訓課程、講座和展覽等，提升法團和業主對大廈管理及維修的知識。同時，民政總署亦會邀請區議員出席及參與，透過區議員和其地區網絡，向社區及居民傳遞相關信息。

部分舊式單幢大廈因單位數量不多，財政資源不足，難以獨自聘用專業物管公司協助處理日常的大廈管理工作。民政總署已於二○二五年六月在油尖旺、深水埗、九龍城及荃灣四區啓動「聯廈聯管」試驗計劃，為期一年，透過委聘具備地區網絡及大廈管理經驗的地區組織，協助區內的舊式樓宇，共同聘請一間物管公司聯合管理大廈，攤分管理成本，以較相宜的費用獲得日常的大廈管理服務，從而改善居住環境。如希望參與試驗計劃的大廈未成立法團，地區組織會先轉介予「專業顧問服務計劃」以協助該大廈成立法團。然而，如因個別情況而未能成立法團，但有關大廈的業主均同意參與試驗計劃，獲委聘的地區組織亦會提供支援，協助有關大廈推行「聯廈聯管」。

計劃推出四個月（截至二○二五年九月三十日）已取得良好的進展。獲委聘的地區組織已合共接觸近130幢大廈，法團和業主反應正面，已經有70幢大廈簽署意向書參與試驗計劃，其中三幢原本屬「三無大廈」，但為了參與試驗計劃而成立法團。目前，16幢大廈已同意聯合招標，並制訂「聯合招標書」，以招標聘請物管公司，期望儘早落實「聯廈聯管」。

行政長官於二○二五年《施政報告》宣布，視乎「聯廈聯管」試驗計劃的推展情況，考慮將試驗計劃推廣至其他地區。

政府自二○一八年先後共投入約190億元，夥拍市區重建局（市建局）推出多項樓宇復修資助計劃，為有需要業主提供財政及技術支援。當中資助業主進行樓宇檢驗及維修工程的主要資助計劃包括「樓宇更新大行動2.0」及「有需要人士維修自住物業津貼計劃」等。

成立法團並非參與這些資助計劃的先決條件。事實上，只要獲得全體業主一致同意，這些資助計劃亦接受「三無大廈」的申請。

（三）一般而言，若位於大廈地鋪範圍內的公用水管出現滲漏而需要維修，大廈相關業主需要商討維修工程上的各項安排，例如維修方法、施工時間、財務安排等，以減低對各方所帶來的影響。其間，水務署會提供技術支援，並在有需要時會聯同當區民政處及區議員提供適切的協助，例如為受影響的用戶提供臨時食水供應。當各方達成共識後，相關業主聘請的承辦商便會進入地鋪範圍進行公用水管維修工程。

根據水務署記錄，過去五年有兩宗涉及因為個別業主拒絕承辦商進入其單位為出現滲漏或爆裂的公用水管進行維修工程，令工程未能及時進行而引致大廈停止食水供應的個案，有關詳情如下：




日期
大廈
個案詳情


二○二四年六月
石塘咀一綜合大廈
位於地鋪後巷的公用水管於六月爆裂，導致地鋪嚴重水浸。基於公眾安全考慮，水務署截斷供水並即時向地舖及住宅單位用戶提供臨時食水。水務署其後提供技術支援予相關的地鋪業主及其他住宅單位業主以商討解決方案，水管維修工程並於同年六月完成。


二○二五年九月
上環荷李活道一綜合大廈
位於大廈地鋪內的公用水管嚴重漏水，影響到附近的公眾樓梯，基於公眾安全考慮，水務署截斷供水並向地鋪及住宅單位用戶即時提供臨時食水。中西區民政事務處及區議員已致力斡旋，但考慮到業主需時達成共識以聘請承辦商，為盡快讓居民的食水供應恢復正常，水務署根據《水務設施條例》第17（3）條賦予的權力，代用戶就該段出現滲漏的水管進行維修工程，工程預計在十月內完成。




（四）根據《建築物條例》，屋宇署會先行發出法定命令，要求業主拆除僭建物或修葺失修私人樓宇或排水渠。如業主缺乏籌組能力導致命令久未遵從，屋宇署會考慮進行代辦工程，並向業主收回工程費用、監督費及附加費。另一方面，如發現有明顯危險或緊急情況，而業主又無法籌組緊急維修，不論是否涉及法定命令，屋宇署均會主動介入，根據《建築物條例》安排政府承建商進行緊急工程，先將危險移除，然後向業主收回工程費用及監督費。

至於水務署方面，《水務設施條例》第17（4）條賦權如用戶或代理人收到水務署發出的維修通知書而並無進行通知書內指明的維修工程時，水務署可進行該等維修工程，有關費用則由該用戶或代理人繳付。此外，《水務設施條例》第17（3）條亦賦權水務署可應用戶或代理人要求而更改或修理內部供水系統或公用供水系統，有關費用須由要求進行該等更改或修理的人繳付。水務署會檢視每宗個案的實際情況，以決定是否會根據《水務設施條例》相關條款代用戶或代理人進行維修工程，主要考慮包括有關單位業主能否於短時間內組職起來聘請承辦商（例如「三無大廈」）、供水系統是否涉及重要設施（例如醫院及機場等），及進行維修工程時會否涉及其他較複雜的工程（例如道路工程）。"
LCQ11: Improving building management of old buildings,2025-10-22 13:15,2025-10-22 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200312.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hok-fung and a written reply by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

The Urban Renewal Authority (URA) and the Hong Kong Institute of Housing jointly implemented a pilot scheme on ""Joint Property Management"" (JPM) in 2022 for old single-block buildings in the ""Lung Shing"" area of Kowloon City. Assistance were provided to old buildings without owners' corporations (OCs) in establishing OCs, and different old single-block buildings were then coordinated to co-appoint a property management company for owners to enjoy professional management services at more affordable costs. However, in its experience report on Kowloon City's JPM Pilot Scheme submitted to the Government in March this year, URA mentioned that among the four buildings in the ""Lung Shing"" area participating in the JPM Pilot Scheme, half of them withdrew from the scheme. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is learnt that many owners of old buildings are elderly retirees who are not keen to participate in building management, leading to the near standstill of OCs of such buildings, of the Government's measures in place to encourage owners of old buildings to improve building management and carry out repairs, such as whether it will allow them to participate in the JPM Pilot Scheme or other subsidised building management schemes without the need to establish an OC;

(2) given that the Government launched the JPM Pilot Scheme in Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City and Tsuen Wan in June this year for a period of one year, and it is learnt that there are over 5 000 private buildings aged 30 years or above in Hong Kong Island West, whether the Government will extend the Pilot Scheme to old private buildings in Hong Kong Island West; if so, of the implementation timetable;

(3) given that some members of the local community have indicated that last month, a public fresh water mains burst incident occurred in an old composite and domestic building on Hollywood Road, but contractors engaged by some residential unit owners were unable to gain access to the ground-floor units to repair the water mains, leaving all residential units of the building without fresh water supply, whether the Government has compiled statistics on the number of cases in the past five years where building maintenance works could not be carried out in a timely manner due to human factors (such as delays or lack of cooperation from the owners concerned); if so, of the number and details of the cases;

(4) given that the Government amended the Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance (Cap. 572) last year to empower the Hong Kong Fire Services Department and the Buildings Department (BD) to carry out fire safety improvement works in default of owners failing to comply with the requirements of Cap. 572, and to recover the costs from them upon completion of the works, and that under the Buildings Ordinance (Cap. 123), BD will also engage government contractors to carry out emergency works in default of owners, whether the Government will, drawing on the practices under Cap. ‍572 and Cap. 123, enact legislation to empower the Water Supplies Department, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department or other government departments to handle building maintenance cases such as water mains or sewer leakage in default of owners, and subsequently recover the costs from the owners; if so, of the timetable for the relevant work?

Reply:

President,

The management and proper maintenance of buildings are the responsibilities of owners. The Government's role in building management is to act as a facilitator by providing a legal framework under the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) to enable owners to form Owners' Corporations (OCs), and by offering a series of support services to assist owners in discharging their responsibilities jointly relating to building management.

Having consulted the Development Bureau, our consolidated reply to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Chan Hok-fung is as follows:

(1)and(2) To strengthen support for OCs and promote effective building management, the Home Affairs Department (HAD) has implemented the Owners' Corporations Advisory Services Scheme since 2018, under which property management companies (PMCs) are engaged to provide OCs in need with free advisory services on building management. These services include assisting in re-activating defunct or inactive management committees (MCs). For ""three-nil"" buildings which do not have any OC and have not engaged any PMC, the HAD has implemented the Building Management Professional Advisory Service Scheme (BMPASS) since 2022 to engage district organisations with experience in building management or related fields to reach out to the owners to encourage and help them form OCs. In addition, the Resident Liaison Ambassador Scheme is implemented to assist government departments in liaising with the residents to discuss and handle building management matters and promote the formation of OCs.

In assisting OCs and owners on handling building maintenance matters, the HAD organises regular briefings via the Central Platform on Building Management. Relevant government departments and institutions, including the Buildings Department (BD), the Fire Services Department, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Labour Department, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) and the Competition Commission, are invited to introduce various services and financial assistance schemes on building management and maintenance. These briefings are held on-site and broadcast via live steaming, with videos subsequently uploaded to the dedicated website of the HAD for easy access by OCs and owners.

Also, the HAD and the 18 District Offices regularly organise various educational and publicity activities on building management, including seminars, training courses, talks, and exhibitions, to enhance OCs' and owners' knowledge of building management and maintenance. The HAD also invites members of the District Councils (DCs) to attend and participate in these activities, with a view to disseminating information to the community and residents through DC members and their district networks.

Some old single-block buildings may encounter difficulties in engaging professional PMCs on their own to assist with day-to-day building management due to the small number of units in the buildings and the lack of adequate financial resources. In June 2025, the HAD launched a one-year Pilot Scheme on ""Joint Property Management""(Pilot Scheme) in Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City and Tsuen Wan to engage district organisations with local networks and experience in building management to assist the old buildings in these districts in jointly hiring a single PMC to manage their buildings, so that the management fees can be apportioned and these buildings will be able to receive day-to-day building management services at a more affordable cost, thereby improving their living environment. For buildings wishing to participate in the Pilot Scheme but have not formed OCs, the district organisations concerned may refer them to the BMPASS to assist them in forming OCs. However, should individual buildings be unable to form OCs due to specific circumstances, but all owners agree to participate in the Pilot Scheme, the district organisations concerned will provide support to assist these buildings in implementing ""joint property management"".

Within four months since its launch (as at September 30, 2025), the Pilot Scheme has made good progress. The district organisations engaged have reached out to nearly 130 buildings. OCs and owners have responded positively, with 70 buildings signing letters of intent to participate in the Pilot Scheme. Among these, three buildings were originally classified as ""three-nil"" buildings but formed OCs for participation in the Pilot Scheme. Currently, 16 buildings have agreed to a joint tender process so as to engage a PMC. They are jointly formulating a joint tender document, with a view to implementing the joint property management initiative as soon as possible.

The Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address that the Government would consider extending the Pilot Scheme to other districts, subject to its implementation outcomes.

The Government has since 2018 introduced a number of subsidy schemes in partnership with the URA with a total financial commitment of $19 billion to provide financial and technical assistance to owners in need. Among the schemes, those relevant to building inspection and repair works include ""Operation Building Bright 2.0"" and ""Building Maintenance Grant Scheme for Needy Owners"", etc.

Formation of OC is not a prerequisite for joining these subsidy schemes. In fact, these subsidy schemes also accept applications from ""three-nil"" buildings, provided that the unanimous consent of all owners is obtained.

(3) In general, when repair works to leaking communal service inside ground floor shop of a building is required, the concerned owners of the building should discuss amongst themselves on various arrangements for the repair works, such as the repair method, timing in carrying out the repairs and the financial arrangement etc., in order to mitigate the impact to various parties. During the course, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) will provide technical support and when necessary, collaborate with the District Office and DC members of the area to provide appropriate assistance such as provision of temporary water supply to the affected users etc. Once consensus is reached by the concerned parties, the contractor appointed by the concerned owners would enter into the ground floor shop to carry out repair works to the communal service.

According to the WSD's record, there were two cases in the past five years where individual owners refused to grant admission to the contractor to enter into their premises for carrying out repair works to the communal service that had developed leaks or bursts, resulting in delay of works and suspension of water supply to the building. Details of the cases are as follows:




Date
Building
Case Details


June 2024
A composite Building at Shek Tong Tsui
In June 2024, main burst of the communal service at ground floor backyard caused serious flooding to shops of the building. For the sake of public safety, the WSD suspended water supply and provided temporary water supply to the shops and residential units of the building. Subsequently, the WSD provided technical support to the owner of the subject shop at ground floor and other owners of the residential units to facilitate their discussion to resolve the problem. The water main repair works completed in June 2024.


September 2025
A composite building at Hollywood Road, Sheung Wan
Serious leakage of the communal service inside a ground floor shop of the building has affected the nearby public staircase. For the sake of public safety, the WSD suspended water supply and provided temporary water supply to the users of the shops and residential units of the building immediately. The District Office and DC members of Central and Western District have provided their utmost effort in mediation. However, considering the time required for the property owners to reach consensus on hiring a contractor, and to restore water supply for the residents as soon as possible, the WSD has commenced repair works to the subject leaking communal service, on behalf of the responsible parties, pursuant to Section 17(3) of the Waterworks Ordinance (WWO). It is anticipated that the repair works would be completed within October.




(4) Under the Buildings Ordinance (BO), the BD will first issue statutory orders requiring owners to remove unauthorised building works or repair dilapidated private buildings/drainage. If owners lack the coordination capability, leading to prolonged non-compliance with orders, the BD will consider carrying out default works and recover the costs of such works, supervision charge and surcharge from the owners. On the other hand, if an obvious danger or emergency is identified and the owner is unable to organise emergency repairs, the BD will proactively intervene regardless of whether a statutory order is involved. The BD will arrange for government contractors to undertake emergency works to remove the danger first, and recover the costs of the works and supervision charge from the owners concerned afterwards in accordance with the BO.

As for the WSD, if a consumer or agent, on receipt of a repair notice, fails to carry out the repairs specified in the notice, the WSD may carry out the repairs and the cost thereof shall be payable by the consumer or agent pursuant to Section 17(4) of the WWO. Moreover, pursuant to Section 17(3) of WWO, the WSD may repair an inside service at the request of a consumer, or a communal service at the request of an agent, and the cost thereof shall be payable by the person at whose request such repair is carried out. The WSD shall critically review the situation of each case before stepping in to carry out the repair works on behalf of the consumer or agent under relevant provisions of the WWO. The major considerations include whether the responsible parties have difficulty in coordinating themselves to appoint a contractor in a short period of time (e.g. cases of ""three-nil"" buildings), whether the water supply involve essential facilities (e.g. hospitals and airport), and whether the repair works involve other more complicated work (e.g. road works)."

大家好！非常高興來到澳門，出席第三屆粵港澳大灣區人才高質量發展大會，與各位共同見證這項重要盛事的開幕。能夠在這個美麗的、充滿活力與文化底蘊的城市，與來自粵港澳三地的政府代表、業界精英、學術領袖齊聚一堂，共同探討人才發展的未來方向，實在令人振奮。

發展大會向來由廣東省政府、香港特區政府及澳門特區政府三方共同主辦。第一第二屆大會分別於二○二三年和二○二四年在廣州及香港舉行。今年的第三屆大會由澳門接力舉辦，充分體現粵港澳三地在人才政策上的緊密協作，也彰顯中央政府在「一國兩制」方針下對粵港澳協同發展的堅定支持。人才是推動社會進步和經濟發展的核心動力，是建設高質量灣區的關鍵因素。三地政府攜手舉辦此項盛會，通過凝聚共識、整合資源、共建平台，肯定會更有力發展和推動人才政策，加速大灣區的高質量發展。

香港特區政府自二○二二年底推出多項措施，吸引和便利世界各地的人才匯集香港。截至今年九月，我們已吸引超過24萬不同界別的全球精英來到香港工作和發展，當中包括透過高端人才通行證計劃來港的99000多位高端人才，構建起國際人才集聚高地，為香港、國家的高質量發展，和加快現代化強國建設作出更大貢獻。

香港特區政府會繼續善用中央政府支持香港發展的各項惠港政策，例如實施「南下」人才和商務簽注、「北上」一簽多行簽證，以及向非中國籍香港永久性居民簽發《港澳居民來往內地通行證（非中國籍）》等，持續優化人才引進制度及配套措施，推動與粵港澳大灣區及主要內地城市的協同發展，共同建設國家高水平人才高地。香港特區政府已先後與北京市、上海市、廣東省、澳門特別行政區、大灣區內地九市、前海和南沙相關單位簽訂七份人才合作備忘錄，涵蓋聯合招才、政策對接、活動共辦等範疇，並積極促進學術、科研及創科領域的深度交流與合作。

憑藉「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，香港會不懈的發揮國際化平台作用，深化區域協作，拓展人才網絡，進一步夯實在引才、聚才、育才方面的綜合能力，為國家高質量發展增添人力動能。為發揮好香港聯通內地與世界、匯聚全球人才的功能，我們今年四月聯同近40家大灣區知名企業，在馬來西亞吉隆坡舉辦粵港澳大灣區人才匯聚發展推介會，及在六月舉辦共建國家高水平人才高地交流會，並得到熱烈的反應和圓滿的成功。

在今次大會，香港人才服務辦公室（人才辦）很榮幸能聯同多位業界代表及企業設立展位，宣傳香港的招攬人才措施，與現場人才深入交流、解答疑問，並介紹金融科技、銀行、電訊科技等行業的發展機遇。藉此機會，我很高興給大家報告，人才辦將於明年三月於香港舉辦全球人才高峰會周。活動以國際人才論壇及人才博覽展為主軸，並於期間舉辦連串與人才及人力資源相關的大型活動，匯聚世界各地和內地政商學以及其他界別領袖，就教育、科技、人才一體化發展互相交流和分享經驗。我誠邀大灣區各兄弟城市蒞臨出席，積極參與和交流。我們深信，只要三地同心協力、攜手並進、持續創新，加快建設大灣區人才高地，我們定能實現互利共贏，為國家發展注入源源不絕的人才動力。

最後，我祝本屆大會圓滿成功，祝各位身體健康、事事順利。謝謝大家！"

香港特區政府自二○二二年底推出多項措施，吸引和便利世界各地的人才匯集香港。截至今年九月，我們已吸引超過24萬不同界別的全球精英來到香港工作和發展，當中包括透過高端人才通行證計劃來港的99000多位高端人才，構建起國際人才集聚高地，為香港、國家的高質量發展，和加快現代化強國建設作出更大貢獻。

香港特區政府會繼續善用中央政府支持香港發展的各項惠港政策，例如實施「南下」人才和商務簽注、「北上」一簽多行簽證，以及向非中國籍香港永久性居民簽發《港澳居民來往內地通行證（非中國籍）》等，持續優化人才引進制度及配套措施，推動與粵港澳大灣區及主要內地城市的協同發展，共同建設國家高水平人才高地。香港特區政府已先後與北京市、上海市、廣東省、澳門特別行政區、大灣區內地九市、前海和南沙相關單位簽訂七份人才合作備忘錄，涵蓋聯合招才、政策對接、活動共辦等範疇，並積極促進學術、科研及創科領域的深度交流與合作。

憑藉「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，香港會不懈的發揮國際化平台作用，深化區域協作，拓展人才網絡，進一步夯實在引才、聚才、育才方面的綜合能力，為國家高質量發展增添人力動能。為發揮好香港聯通內地與世界、匯聚全球人才的功能，我們今年四月聯同近40家大灣區知名企業，在馬來西亞吉隆坡舉辦粵港澳大灣區人才匯聚發展推介會，及在六月舉辦共建國家高水平人才高地交流會，並得到熱烈的反應和圓滿的成功。

在今次大會，香港人才服務辦公室（人才辦）很榮幸能聯同多位業界代表及企業設立展位，宣傳香港的招攬人才措施，與現場人才深入交流、解答疑問，並介紹金融科技、銀行、電訊科技等行業的發展機遇。藉此機會，我很高興給大家報告，人才辦將於明年三月於香港舉辦全球人才高峰會周。活動以國際人才論壇及人才博覽展為主軸，並於期間舉辦連串與人才及人力資源相關的大型活動，匯聚世界各地和內地政商學以及其他界別領袖，就教育、科技、人才一體化發展互相交流和分享經驗。我誠邀大灣區各兄弟城市蒞臨出席，積極參與和交流。我們深信，只要三地同心協力、攜手並進、持續創新，加快建設大灣區人才高地，我們定能實現互利共贏，為國家發展注入源源不絕的人才動力。

最後，我祝本屆大會圓滿成功，祝各位身體健康、事事順利。謝謝大家！"
立法會一題：促進金融市場發展的措施,2025-10-22 13:04,2025-10-22 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200343.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上譚岳衡議員的提問和署理財經事務及庫務局局長陳浩濂的答覆：

問題：

據報今年首九個月香港的首次公開招股集資額已比去年同期上升逾百分之二百。關於促進金融市場發展的措施，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否因應來自不同司法管轄區的企業，制訂靈活的資訊披露標準和上市過渡安排，以吸引更多國際企業赴港上市，從而提升香港資本市場的國際地位，並吸引更多資金流入；

（二）會否持續推動交易所買賣基金（ETF）市場的金融科技發展及產品多樣化，例如利用區塊鏈技術開拓創新的市場基建及提供更多全球化的ETF產品，以將香港打造成國際領先的ETF交易中心；及

（三）據報自GEM（前稱「創業板」）於去年實施改革措施後，共有四家企業在GEM上市，而今年於GEM上市的新股更錄得超額逾9 000倍的認購，政府是否知悉，香港交易及結算所有限公司有否評估GEM的改革成效，以及會如何持續優化整體上市制度，以打造一個更健康及可持續發展的資本市場？

答覆：

主席：

香港作為國際金融中心，政府一直推動證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）和香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）善用「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，包括就證券市場不同範疇進行改革，推出多項上市制度優化，推動市場高質量發展。

在一系列上市制度革新的帶動下，香港新股市場今年首三季已迎來69家新上市公司，首次公開招股集資額超過1,800億港元，較去年同期上升超過兩倍，位列全球首位。上市申請個案亦正快速增加，港交所於九月底正處理近300宗上市申請。此外，GEM市場自二○二四年改革以來共有四家企業上市，融資額達2.8億港元。今年以來共收到11家中小企業申請在GEM上市，可見早前的措施初見成效。把握二○二五年勢頭持續向好，港交所和證監會正推進進一步的制度優化，以增強香港市場的活力和競爭力。

就問題的三個部分，經諮詢證監會和港交所後，我回覆如下：

（一）及（三）香港作為連接全球和國家的「超級聯繫人」，發揮高效雙向連接國際資本和內地資產的功能。國際機構投資者廣泛參與香港首次公開招股市場，今年以來更多海外包括來自泰國、印尼、哈薩克斯坦、新加坡等地的發行人選擇在港上市。國際參與也吸引內地企業加快透過香港市場進行海外布局，年初以來至九月底，有超過一半赴港上市的公司有國際化業務布局，這些企業平均約一半收入來自海外市場。

政府會繼續推動證監會和港交所優化上市機制，吸引來自世界各地具發展潛力的企業來港上市融資。就此，港交所已優化海外發行人的上市規定，引入一套適用於所有發行人的核心股東保障水平並刊發指引以便利合規。就在海外上市的企業，港交所已為它們在港進行雙重主要上市或第二上市建立便利的路徑，包括放寬沒有不同投票權架構的大中華發行人在港第二上市的市值要求；並給予擁有不同投票權或可變利益實體結構而符合第二上市規定的合資格發行人更大靈活性在港獲得主要上市地位。港交所亦自二○二三年先後將多家來自中東和東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）地區的交易所納入其認可證券交易所範圍，便利在相關主板市場上市的公司可在香港第二上市。此外，港交所亦制定靈活的資訊披露標準和過渡安排，包括在適當情況下讓海外發行人在編制年度財務報表時採用香港或國際財務報告準則以外其他獲港交所認可的準則，以及為由第二上市轉換至雙重主要上市的發行人授予全面遵守《上市規則》的寬限期，為海外發行人提供便利。

為增強香港作為上市地的競爭力，證監會和港交所一直持續審視各項上市改革的成效並積極跟進《行政長官2025年施政報告》中提出的各項措施，包括在平衡相關風險和對投資者的保障下進一步完善上市制度的各個層面，研究優化「同股不同權」上市規定。研究亦會在GEM改革的基礎上進一步探討如何更好服務不同類型和規模的企業的融資需要，及吸引更多投資者及資本進入香港市場。港交所會按「成熟一項、推出一項」原則就優化建議適時對外公布，並進行公眾諮詢。

（二）環球交易所買賣基金（ETF）市場近年迅速發展，協助投資者有效分散投資組合、涵蓋多元資產類別及投資策略。政府一直推動本地ETF市場發展，分別於二○一五年和二○二○年起豁免ETF二級市場交易和市場莊家在參與發行及贖回ETF單位過程中的股票買賣印花稅，降低相關交易和上市成本。二○二二年，ETF獲納入「滬深港通」機制，讓香港及海外投資者可買賣在上海及深圳交易所上市的合資格ETF，同時讓內地投資者可投資在香港上市的合資格ETF。

與此同時，我們積極壯大本地的ETF生態圈。自二○二三年，我們迎來多項產品創新，包括亞洲首隻追蹤沙特阿拉伯市場的ETF於香港上市，以及兩隻追蹤港股的ETF在沙特交易所以聯接基金方式上市，建立兩地資本雙向流通的橋樑。去年，港交所推出亞洲首批虛擬資產現貨ETF及香港首批備兌認購期權ETF，滿足投資者對非傳統資產、應對潛在市場波動及對沖下行風險的需求。今年，我們亦迎來全球第五大市值的ETF來港跨境上市，以及首隻伊斯蘭債券ETF在港上市。

憑藉相關政策支持，香港已發展成為亞洲最大及最活躍的ETF市場之一，吸引眾多發行人、市場莊家及投資者參與。二○二五年首三季，香港市場ETF的平均每日成交額達342億港元，較二○二四年全年平均躍升百分之一百一十三，較二○二三年全年平均更上升百分之一百九十。截至九月底，香港ETF市場的資產管理規模已達到6,254億港元。

我們期望與各持份者緊密合作，致力推出更多創新產品，包括推動代幣化ETF產品的發行和交易及協助發行人發行黃金相關ETF，繼續強化香港作為全方位領先ETF交易中心的地位。我們亦支持港交所進一步加強在東盟和中東的推廣工作，積極與區內國家探索包括ETF上市方面的合作空間，將進一步豐富本地ETF生態圈。

多謝主席。"
LCQ1: Measures to promote development of financial market,2025-10-22 13:04,2025-10-22 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200344.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Tan Yueheng and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

  It has been reported that the funds raised through initial public offerings in Hong Kong in the first nine months of this year has increased by over 200 per cent as compared with the same period last year. Regarding measures to promote the development of the financial market, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will, in the light of enterprises from different jurisdictions, establish flexible information disclosure standards and transitional arrangements for listing to attract more international enterprises to list in Hong Kong, thereby elevating the international status of Hong Kong's capital market and drawing greater capital inflow;

(2) whether it will continue to promote fintech development and product diversification of the exchange traded fund (ETF) market, such as exploring innovative market infrastructure with the use of blockchain technology and offering more globalised ETF products, with a view to developing Hong Kong into a leading international ETF trading hub; and

(3) as it has been reported that since the implementation of the GEM (formerly known as ""Growth Enterprise Market"") reform measures last year, a total of four enterprises have listed on GEM, and a new listing on GEM this year has even recorded an oversubscription of over 9 000 times, whether the Government knows if the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited has assessed the effectiveness of the GEM reforms, and how it will continue to refine the overall listing regime for developing a healthier and sustainable capital market?

Reply:

President,

  With Hong Kong as an international financial centre, the Government is driving the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to better leverage our unique advantages of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world under ""one country, two systems"". This includes taking forward reforms across different areas of the securities market and implementing various enhancements to the listing regime to promote high-quality market development.

  With the implementation of a series of listing reforms, Hong Kong's primary market saw 69 newly listed companies in the first three quarters of 2025 with over HK$180 billion raised through initial public offerings (IPO), representing an increase of over two times compared to the same period last year and ranking first globally. The number of listing applications is also surging. The HKEX was processing close to 300 listing applications as of end-September. In addition, four companies were listed on GEM since its reform in 2024, raising HK$280 million. 11 applications from small and medium enterprises for listing on GEM have been received so far this year, indicating that the earlier measures are beginning to yield results. Riding on the positive momentum in 2025, the HKEX and the SFC are taking forward further institutional enhancements to strengthen the vibrancy and competitiveness of Hong Kong's market.

  In consultation with the SFC and the HKEX, my reply to the three parts of the question is as follows:

(1) and (3) As a ""super connector"" between the world and our country, Hong Kong serves the function to facilitate efficient two-way flows of international and Mainland capital. International institutional investors have wide participation in Hong Kong's IPO market. More overseas issuers, including those from Thailand, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Singapore, etc, have chosen to list in Hong Kong this year. International participation has also attracted Mainland enterprises to accelerate their global expansion through Hong Kong's market. Since the beginning of the year until end-September, over half of the companies listing in Hong Kong have international businesses, with about 50 per cent of their revenue generated from overseas markets.

 The Government will continue to drive the SFC and the HKEX to refine the listing mechanism for attracting enterprises with growth potential from around the world to list and raise funds in Hong Kong. To this end, the HKEX enhanced the listing requirements for overseas issuers by introducing a set of core shareholder protection standards applicable to all issuers and publishing guidance to facilitate compliance. For enterprises listed overseas, the HKEX established facilitative pathways for them to seek dual-primary or secondary listing in Hong Kong. This includes relaxing the market capitalisation requirement for Greater China issuers without weighted voting rights (WVR) structures to secondary list in Hong Kong, and offering greater flexibility for eligible issuers with WVR or variable interest entity structures which meet the requirements for secondary listing to obtain primary listing status in Hong Kong. The HKEX has also included a number of exchanges from the Middle East and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region onto its list of recognised stock exchanges successively since 2023, facilitating companies listed on relevant markets to seek secondary listing in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKEX has formulated flexible information disclosure standards and transitional arrangements to provide facilitation to overseas issuers, such as where appropriate, permitting overseas issuers to prepare annual financial statements using standards as recognised by the HKEX other than Hong Kong or international financial reporting standards, and granting grace periods for full compliance with the Listing Rules for issuers transitioning from secondary to dual-primary listings.

  To strengthen Hong Kong's competitiveness as a listing venue, the SFC and the HKEX have been continuously assessing the effectiveness of the listing reforms and actively following up on various initiatives outlined in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address. They include further refining different aspects of the listing regime while balancing relevant risks and investor protection, and reviewing the listing requirements for companies with WVR structures. The review will also further explore ways to better serve the fundraising needs of enterprises of different types and sizes on the basis of the GEM reform, as well as attracting more investors and capital to enter Hong Kong's market. The HKEX will announce relevant enhancement measures with public consultation to be conducted as appropriate once they are ready.

(2) The global exchange-traded fund (ETF) market has grown rapidly in recent years, facilitating investors to diversify their investment portfolios across different asset classes and strategies effectively. The Government is committed to supporting the development of local ETF market. We have waived the stamp duty on secondary market trading of ETFs and stock transactions by market makers in the course of creating and redeeming ETF units since 2015 and 2020 respectively, thereby lowering relevant trading and listing costs. In 2022, ETFs were included under Stock Connect, allowing Hong Kong and overseas investors to trade eligible ETFs listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, and enabling Mainland investors to invest in eligible ETFs listed in Hong Kong.

  Meanwhile, we proactively expand the local ETF ecosystem. Since 2023, we saw various product innovations, including the listing of Asia's first ETF tracking the Saudi Arabia market in Hong Kong, and the listing of two ETFs tracking Hong Kong stocks on Saudi Exchange in the form of feeder funds, establishing a bridge for two-way capital flows between the two places. Last year, the HKEX launched Asia's first batch of spot virtual asset ETFs and Hong Kong's first batch of covered call ETFs, catering to investors' demand for non-traditional assets as well as tools to manage potential market volatility and hedge downside risks. This year, we also welcomed the cross-border listing of the world's fifth-largest ETF by market capitalisation and the listing of the first Islamic bond ETF in Hong Kong.

  With strong policy support, Hong Kong has developed into one of Asia's largest and most active ETF markets, attracting participation of a wide range of issuers, market makers and investors. In the first three quarters of 2025, the average daily turnover of ETFs in Hong Kong reached HK$34.2 billion, up 113 per cent from the full-year average in 2024 and 190 per cent from the full-year average in 2023. As of end-September, assets under management in Hong Kong's ETF market reached HK$625.4 billion.

  We look forward to working closely with different stakeholders, striving to introduce more innovative products including promoting the issuance and trading of tokenised ETFs and assisting issuers to issue gold-related ETFs, thereby further reinforcing Hong Kong's position as an all-rounded leading ETF trading hub. We also support the HKEX's efforts to further step up its promotional work in ASEAN and the Middle East, and to actively explore collaboration opportunities with countries in the region including ETF listings to further enrich the local ETF ecosystem.

  Thank you, President."

He will depart for Beijing later today for a visit.

This year's Joint Session focused on how APEC member economies can seize the opportunities and address the challenges brought about by AI and digital transformation through policy co-ordination, regulatory reforms, capacity building and regional co-operation. The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, also attended the session.

At the meeting, Mr Chan shared Hong Kong, China's experience in developing AI and advancing digital transformation, and offered suggestions on APEC's work in this regard. He noted that AI and digital transformation are among the most transformative forces of today. Hong Kong, China has adopted a dual strategy of developing AI as a core industry and empowering industries through AI, with efforts focused on five key areas: computing power, algorithms, application scenarios, data and funding support.

Mr Chan noted that Hong Kong, China has invested over HK$200 billion in innovation and technology, with AI development being a key focus. Major initiatives include the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute to promote upstream innovation and cross-sectoral applications of AI, as well as the launch of the AI Supercomputing Centre last year to provide computing resources to universities, research institutions and enterprises through funding schemes.

On regulation and governance, Mr Chan said that Hong Kong is committed to developing a framework for the responsible use of AI. Relevant initiatives include the issuance of the Policy Statement on Responsible Application of Artificial Intelligence in Financial Market, as well as the EthicalArtificial Intelligence Framework and the Hong Kong Generative Artificial Intelligence Technical and Application Guideline, both of which are aligned with international best practices. Internally, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has set up the AI Efficacy Enhancement Team to streamline workflows through effective application of AI technologies, and is developing a Digital Corporate Identity platform to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of public services.

Mr Chan stressed the importance of enhancing AI preparedness among the public to prepare for the future. Hong Kong, China is incorporating AI into all levels of education and expanding professional training programmes to comprehensively strengthen the workforce's capacity for the AI era. At the same time, Hong Kong is actively attracting top global talent in relevant fields. Furthermore, the city places strong emphasis on supporting the digital transformation of small and medium-sized enterprises, rolling out various funding schemes and support measures to help businesses adopt emerging technologies and enhance competitiveness.

In conclusion, Mr Chan proposed that APEC should strengthen co-operation in three key areas: (1) capacity building, knowledge and experience sharing, and technical support, especially to assist emerging and developing economies in bridging the digital divide; (2) deepening co-operation on digital governance by promoting policy dialogue on AI regulatory frameworks, cross-border data flows and digital trade; and (3) advancing the regional innovation and technology ecosystem to support start-ups and cross-border research and collaboration. He reiterated Hong Kong, China's readiness to strengthen collaboration with fellow member economies to harness emerging technologies for the benefit of people and economic development of the region.

Mr Chan will depart for Beijing later today, leading a delegation comprising representatives from the Government, academia, public organisations and the business sector to visit the Beijing subsidiary administrative centre and the Xiong'an New Area in the Hebei Province."
立法會十題：保障動物權益,2025-10-22 12:55,2025-10-22 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200282.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上郭玲麗議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

有意見認為，雖然政府近年推出多項寵物友善措施，包括增設寵物共享公園，以及《行政長官2025年施政報告》提出的容許狗隻進入食肆牌照，但政府仍可進一步研究保障動物權益的措施，以及規管動物善終服務。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年相關政府部門就打擊非法動物繁殖場而進行的巡查次數，以及接獲的相關投訴和作出檢控的個案宗數為何（以表列出）；上述巡查行動中獲救的動物種類和數目為何；

（二）據報有非法動物繁殖場以不人道方式對待動物，並透過售賣動物牟取暴利，政府會否全面檢視保護動物權益的相關法例，以加強打擊該等非法行為；如會，詳情為何；

（三）鑑於《狂犬病條例》（第421章）訂明，動物畜養人如無合理解釋而棄掉其動物，即屬犯罪，政府在過去五年有否根據上述第421章的相關條文提出檢控；如有，每年成功檢控的個案宗數及相關判罰為何；如否，原因為何；及

（四）鑑於政府於二○二三年十一月二十二日回覆本人的書面質詢時表示，暫時沒有計劃就動物善終服務營辦商訂立牌照制度，但據悉現時在工業大廈提供動物火化服務仍涉及違反土地契約、公眾衞生等問題，政府會否研究制定專門法例規管該等營辦商，並重新考慮設立相關發牌機制；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何，以及會否考慮由政府或其指定的承辦商直接提供動物火化服務？

答覆：

主席：

就郭玲麗議員的提問，經諮詢發展局和相關政府部門後，現回覆如下：

（一）現時經營繁育狗隻並出售該等狗隻或其後代的處所，必須按《公眾衞生（動物及禽鳥）（售賣及繁育）規例》（第139B章）申領有效的繁育狗隻牌照並遵從牌照條件和營業守則。無牌經營上述處所最高可處罰款十萬元，違反牌照或許可證條件最高可處罰款五萬元。

漁農自然護理署（漁護署）會定期巡查繁育狗隻的持牌處所，如發現違規情況會作出檢控。過去五年相關巡查數字載列於附件。另一方面，漁護署會按投訴和風險評估調查懷疑非法繁育狗隻作出售用途的處所，過去五年（二○二○年至二○二四年）署方分別接獲22、11、18、26和22宗投訴，經調查後並沒有發現違法的情況，亦沒有因為發現殘酷對待動物而需撿取該些處所的動物。

（二）根據《防止殘酷對待動物條例》（第169章）（《條例》），任何人作出或不作出某種行爲而導致動物受到不必要的痛苦，可構成觸犯殘酷對待動物罪行；一經定罪，最高可判處罰款二十萬元及監禁三年。政府絕不容忍殘酷對待動物的行為，會針對違法行為嚴厲執法，以保障動物福利。

我們正就《條例》的修訂作出研究，在籌備修訂《條例》的草案時，須就部分建議再徵詢相關持份者。持份者對於應否在現階段引入「謹慎責任」，以及殘酷對待動物罰則的水平持不同意見。我們會繼續收集和考慮各方意見。一俟完成有關工作，我們會向立法會交代相關工作的未來路向。

（三）根據《狂犬病條例》（第421章）第22條，動物畜養人如無合理解釋而棄掉其動物，最高可處罰款一萬元和監禁六個月。如有足夠證據（如有目擊證人或閉路電視片段）漁護署會向涉嫌人士提出檢控，否則漁護署一般會按情況視之為畜養人未有在公眾地方妥善控制其狗隻以致狗隻走失，並根據《狂犬病條例》第23條提出檢控。過去五年，該署並無按《狂犬病條例》第22條提出檢控，而按第23條成功檢控的宗數表列如下：

（四）在收到有動物火化營運處所涉及衞生滋擾、環境污染或火警危險的投訴時，食物環境衞生署（食環署）、環境保護署和消防處均會分別根據現有法例進行巡查，並按需要採取執法行動。

此外，動物火化營運商須確保其營運場所符合地契條款。一般工業大廈（工廈）訂明地段只可作工業及／或倉庫用途，於工廈進行動物火化屬違反地契條款，而且動物火化和相關服務連帶的顧客人流亦可能引起公眾安全風險。地政總署如接獲涉及違反地契條款的投訴，會跟進巡查；如證明屬實，署方會採取適當的土地執管行動。一般而言，倘若有關人士向地政總署申請修訂地契或豁免，以便容許作動物火化用途，署方須諮詢相關部門。

由於現時已有法例規管動物火化營運商，而市民亦可將離世的寵物屍體在妥善包裹和註明後交給食環署公眾垃圾收集站的職員處理，政府並無計劃提供寵物屍體火化服務，或另行制定專門法例規管這服務。"
LCQ10: Safeguarding the rights and interests of animals,2025-10-22 12:55,2025-10-22 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200286.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Lillian Kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

 There are views that while the Government has introduced various pet-friendly measures in recent years, including the establishment of more Inclusive Parks for Pets and a licensing arrangement proposed in the 2025 Policy Address for allowing dogs to enter food premises, the Government can still further explore measures to safeguard the rights and interests of animals and regulate animal hospice services. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of inspections conducted by the relevant Government departments to crack down on illegal animal breeding facilities, as well as the numbers of related complaints received and prosecutions instituted, in each of the past five years (set out in a table); the types and numbers of animals rescued in the aforesaid inspections;

(2) as it has been reported that there are illegal animal breeding facilities treating animals inhumanely and profiteering through the sale of animals, whether the Government will comprehensively review the legislation relating to the protection of the rights and interests of animals, so as to step up efforts in combating such illegal acts; if so, of the details;

(3) as the Rabies Ordinance (Cap. 421) provides that a keeper of any animal who, without reasonable excuse, abandons that animal commits an offence, whether the Government has instituted any prosecutions under the aforesaid relevant provision of Cap. 421 over the past five years; if so, of the number of successful prosecutions and the relevant penalties imposed in each of the years; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) as the Government indicated in its reply to my written question on November 22, 2023 that it had no plan to introduce a licensing regime for animal hospice service operators back then, but it is learnt that currently the provision of animal cremation services in industrial buildings still involves issues such as breaches of land leases and public health concerns, whether the Government will study the enactment of dedicated legislation to regulate such operators, and reconsider introducing a relevant licensing mechanism; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and whether consideration will be given to providing animal cremation services directly by the Government or its designated contractors?

Reply:

President,

 Having consulted the Development Bureau and the relevant Government departments, the reply to the question from the Hon Lillian Kwok is as follows:

(1) Currently, any person who operates a dog breeding premises and sells those dogs or their offspring must possess a valid Dog Breeder Licence in accordance with the Public Health (Animals and Birds) (Trading and Breeding) Regulations (Cap. 139B), and must comply with the relevant licence conditions and the code of practice. Operating the above premises without a valid licence is subject to a maximum fine of $100,000, while non-compliance with the licence conditions or permit conditions is subject to a maximum fine of $50,000.

 The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) conducts regular inspections to licensed dog breeding premises. Prosecutions will be instigated against any violation identified. The inspection figures in the past five years are set out in Annex. Furthermore, based on complaints and risk assessments, the AFCD conducts investigation on premises suspected of illegal dog breeding activities for sale purpose. In the past five years (2020 to 2024), the department respectively received 22, 11, 18, 26, and 22 complaints. After investigation, no illegal activity was detected, nor was it necessary to seize the animals from detection of animal cruelty.

(2) According to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance (Cap. 169) (the Ordinance), anyone who does or omits to do any act and causes any unnecessary suffering to any animal may constitute an offence of animal cruelty. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty is a fine of $200,000 and imprisonment for three years. The Government will not tolerate any act of animal cruelty and takes stringent enforcement actions against illegal act to safeguard animal welfare.

 We have been studying amendments to the Ordinance. In preparing the bill to amend the Ordinance, it is necessary to consult the relevant stakeholders again on some of the proposals. There are divergent views among stakeholders on the introduction of ""Duty of Care"" at this stage and the penalty level for animal cruelty. We will continue to collect and consider the opinions from all parties. Once the work is completed, we will present the way forward of the relevant work to the Legislative Council.

(3) According to Section 22 of the Rabies Ordinance (Cap. 421), a keeper of any animal who, without reasonable excuse, abandons that animal, is subject to a maximum fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for six months. When there is sufficient evidence (such as eye-witness accounts or CCTV footage), the AFCD will instigate prosecution against the suspect. Otherwise, the AFCD generally, depending on the circumstances, regards the keeper as failing to keep that animal under control and causing that animal to wander into a public place, and will instigate prosecution in accordance to Section 23 of the Rabies Ordinance. In the past five years, no prosecution was instigated in accordance with Section 22, while the number of successful prosecutions under Section 23 are tabulated below:




Year

(4) Upon receipt of complaints about animal cremation operating premises causing sanitary nuisance, environmental pollution or fire hazard, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Environmental Protection Department and Fire Services Department will respectively conduct inspection and take enforcement action as necessary in accordance with existing legislations.

 Furthermore, animal cremation providers must ensure their operating premises comply with the terms of the land lease. In general, lots of industrial buildings (IBs) are specified for industrial and/or godown uses. Animal cremation within IBs is in breach of lease restrictions. Also, the flow of people arising from animal cremation and relevant services may pose risks to public safety. The Lands Department will conduct follow-up inspections on complaints received involving breach of lease conditions, and if verified, the department will take lease enforcement actions as appropriate. In general, if the relevant persons make an application to the Lands Department for lease modification or waiver so as to accommodate animal cremation purposes, Lands Department would consult relevant departments.

 Considering that animal cremation providers are regulated by existing legislations, and members of the public may properly wrap, label and pass the body of their deceased pets to FEHD's staff at public refuse collection points for handling, the Government has no plans to provide pet cremation services or to introduce specific legislation to regulate such services."
LCQ16: Introduction of market-based business models into LCSD facilities,2025-10-22 12:53,2025-10-22 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200284.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Dominic Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

The Government announced in the 2025 Policy Address its plan to introduce market-based business models into designated facilities of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) to enhance visitor experience and operational efficacy. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) how the Government will specifically implement the aforementioned plan to introduce market-based business models, and whether it will, for example, provide clear information on available dates and time slots for venue bookings, and offer short-term or long-term (such as annual) rental options;

(2) of the annual attendance, utilisation rates of various facilities, and income sources of each museum under the LCSD over the past five years; whether the Government has plans to draw upon practices at overseas tourist attractions and experience in shopping mall management to introduce cultural and creative projects, design mascots, put in place photo spots and immersive interactive exhibits at the LCSD museums and other indoor exhibition venues, and open such venues to commercial organisations for hosting guided tours, games, augmented reality (AR) experiences, festive events or themed exhibitions; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) as it is learnt that some private fitness centres have utilised facial recognition technology and intelligent systems for 24-hour operation, whether the Government will consider introducing similar technology or upgrading the existing intelligent sports and recreation services booking information system named SmartPLAY, so that all the LCSD sports centres and related facilities (such as pitches/courts and fitness rooms) can operate 24 hours a day, thereby maximising venue utilisation and achieving intelligent management; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) whether the Government has plans to combine market-based business models with the concept of smart outdoor parks, incorporating technological elements into outdoor recreation and sports facilities (such as utilising big data and the Internet of Things to enable members of the public to connect fitness equipment with their mobile phones to record their exercise data and physical condition, with the system then recommending personalised fitness programmes), thereby enhancing the public's experience and utilisation rates; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) whether it has further studied the feasibility of implementing market-based business models at all the LCSD facilities (including the impact on fees, service quality and public participation); if so, of the study results; if not, whether it will consider conducting relevant studies?

Reply:

President,

It is announced in the 2025 Policy Address that the Government will introduce market-based business models into designated facilities of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) to provide more diverse value-added activities, and explore the feasibility of engaging the market to enhance the operations of the Lei Yue Mun Park holiday camp and selected beaches with a view to developing recreational, leisure and aquatic hotspots.

My reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) and (5) The LCSD plans to make available not less than eight of its facilities, such as museums and parks (including the Hong Kong Museum of Art (HKMoA) and Kai Tak Station Square) within 2026 to introduce commercial elements and to flexibly provide more diverse value-added activities, such as leasing out museum venues on their closing days for commercial or private activities, introducing paid guided tours for visitor groups, and developing more cultural and creative products.

The LCSD plans to engage a professional operator (such as an event planning company) to leverage its market knowledge and professional expertise for marketing suitable venues to target clients, providing technical and logistical support for events, arranging exclusive guided tours of large-scale exhibitions at the LCSD museums for target groups, and providing client management services. We are now formulating the relevant details.

Regarding the operations of the Lei Yue Mun Park holiday camp and selected beaches, the LCSD will invite interested commercial entities or non-profit organisations to submit proposals for operating the Lei Yue Mun Park holiday camp on a commercial basis, and developing selected beaches into new recreational, leisure and aquatic venues. Interested operators are encouraged to put forward feasible proposals. The LCSD is now exploring the concrete market-based business models. Detailed arrangements as well as the fees to be charged will be subject to the nature and content of the activities, venue conditions, etc. The above initiatives are in the exploration phase, and the LCSD will assess their effectiveness in due course, including their impact on service quality, public participation and revenue.

(2) Attendance of the LCSD museums and average utilisation of museum facilities in the past five years are tabulated below:




Year
Attendance
Average utilisation of museum facilities (Note 2)


2020-21
850000 (Note 1)
76.2 per cent


2021-22
3270000 (Note 1)
78.6 per cent


2022-23
4370000 (Note 1)
76.2 per cent


2023-24
7000000
77.3 per cent


2024-25
7660000
69.5 per cent




Note 1: Due to the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, museums and venues under the LCSD were temporarily and intermittently closed from 2020 to 2022.
Note 2: Other than exhibition galleries and exhibition halls, museum facilities include lecture halls, activity rooms and theatres.

The LCSD museums provide broad access to cultural education and public services for the community and do not aim solely for commercial profits. Currently, apart from a low admission fee (from $10 to $20) being charged by the permanent exhibitions of the Hong Kong Science Museum and the Hong Kong Space Museum, all permanent exhibitions of other museums are open to the public for free. Major revenue sources of the LCSD museums include admission fees and rental charges for hiring facilities, sale of cultural and creative and artistic products, tickets of public programmes (such as film screenings), as well as permit/licence fees for operating shops and cafes.

The LCSD museums promote the development of the arts and cultural industries on an ongoing basis through collaborations with local brands in the cultural and creative industries. For example, we launch cross-over products with different brands this year, including the collaboration with a stationery brand during the Hong Kong ICH Month 2025 in June, where an artist with disability was invited to design stickers of 10 intangible cultural heritage items of Hong Kong, allowing customers to create personalised notebooks; releasing three limited-edition gift boxes in collaboration with a local bakery in July, with artworks from the collections of the Hong Kong Heritage Museum (HKHM) and the HKMoA for showcasing the century-old craftsmanship of the bakery and the aesthetics of our museums. Moreover, we will be partnering with two local brands to launch museum-themed brick sets and food products respectively to promote Muse Fest HK 2025 in November.

The LCSD continues to incorporate new technological elements when staging exhibitions in its museums and to set up photo-taking spots and immersive exhibits to enhance the visitor experience. For example, the ""Comic Fun for All: The Magic of Hong Kong Comedy Comics"" exhibition currently at the HKHM presents an innovative, inspiring and educational museum experience to visitors by featuring immersive projection programmes, comics viewing interactive installations, experiences with AI-generated images, as well as interactive installations for photo-taking with comic characters. The exhibition ""Legacy of Lingnan School of Painting: In Commemoration of the 120th Anniversary of the Birth of Chao Shao-an"" just opened this September at the HKHM, on the other hand, creates an immersive digital sea of flowers using Professor Chao's paintings of Lingnan scenery and bird-and-flower, guiding visitors into the vibrant world depicted in the master's works and immersing them in a wonderland of Lingnan blossoms. Furthermore, the ""Engaging Past Wisdom: Min Chiu Society at Sixty-five"" exhibition currently at the HKMoA employs holographic imaging technology to reinterpret the artefacts in three dimensions, allowing visitors to interact with the exhibits and enhancing their interest in and understanding of the artefacts.

(3) The LCSD is committed to promoting the culture of ""Sport for All"" and provides a diverse range of sports and recreational facilities to encourage the public to build a healthy lifestyle. While the fee-charging recreational facilities of the LCSD (such as fitness rooms, sports grounds and turf soccer pitches) generally open from 7am to 11pm, most non-fee charging facilities (such as some 900 sets of outdoor fitness equipment in parks and playgrounds across the territory) open 24 hours a day. The existing arrangements regarding the opening hours of sports and recreational facilities cater to the needs of most people. As adjusting the opening hours (including opening fitness rooms 24-hour a day) requires additional public resources, the LCSD has no such plans at the moment.

Regarding facility management and operation, the LCSD has been enhancing efficiency and service quality through the application of technology, such as launching the intelligent sports and recreational services booking and information system, SmartPLAY, with a dedicated website and a mobile app, in 2023, to enable members of the public in logging into personal accounts, searching and booking sports and recreational facilities, or enrolling in sports and recreational programmes anytime and anywhere. The LCSD will continue to keep an open mind to explore actively on the use of technology in assisting the management of sports and recreational facilities, thereby providing better leisure services to the public.

(4) The LCSD is introducing technology elements to park facilities to enhance the experience of the public. For instance, to provide additional novel outdoor fitness facilities suitable for use by different age groups, the LCSD is installing, on a trial basis, outdoor fitness stations with smart elements at four outdoor leisure venues, allowing users to store and retrieve data of their physical activities and access health information after using these smart fitness facilities. This will facilitate their management of personal health and monitoring of physical fitness, as well as enhance the pleasure of exercising, thereby encouraging members of the public to exercise on a regular basis. The first smart fitness station at Victoria Park has been opened for public use since March 2025. It is expected that the smart fitness stations at Hoi Fai Road Promenade in Tai Kok Tsui, Kowloon Tsai Park and Hoi Chu Road Playground in Tuen Mun will commence service within this year."
立法會十六題：在康文署設施引入市場營運模式,2025-10-22 12:52,2025-10-22 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200281.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上李梓敬議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

政府於二○二五年《施政報告》公布，計劃於康樂及文化事務署（康文署）指定設施引入市場營運模式，以提升旅客體驗和經營效能。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）政府如何具體落實上述引入市場營運模式的計劃，例如會否在場地預訂方面，提供清晰的可供申請日期及時段資料，以及在租用形式方面提供短期或長期（例如按年租用）選擇等；

（二）過去五年，每年康文署轄下的每間博物館的入場人次、各項設施使用率，以及收入來源為何；政府有否計劃參考外國旅遊景點的做法及商場管理的經驗，在康文署博物館及其他室內展覽場地引入文創項目、設計吉祥物、設置打卡位及沉浸式互動展品，並開放予商業機構舉辦導賞、遊戲、擴增實境（AR）體驗，以及節慶活動或主題展覽；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；

（四）政府有否計劃將市場營運模式與戶外智慧公園的概念結合，在戶外康體設施加入科技元素（例如利用大數據及物聯網等技術，讓市民連接健身器材和手機記錄自己的運動數據及身體狀況，並由系統建議個人的健體方案），從而提升市民體驗及使用率；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（五）有否進一步研究在所有康文署設施推行市場營運模式的可行性（包括對收費、服務質素及市民參與度的影響）；若有，評估結果為何；若否，會否考慮進行相關研究？

答覆：

主席：

二○二五年《施政報告》提出，政府會在康樂及文化事務署（康文署）指定設施引入市場營運模式，提供更多元的增值活動；並會探討邀請市場參與，提升鯉魚門公園度假營的營運及在指定試點營運沙灘，以建設康樂休閒及水上活動熱點。

就提問的各個部分，我現回覆如下：

（一）及（五）康文署計劃於二○二六年內選出不少於八個轄下設施，包括博物館和公園（例如香港藝術館及啟德車站廣場），引入商業元素及靈活地提供更多元的增值活動，例如在博物館閉館日出租場地舉辦商業或私人活動，推出收費的旅客團體導賞以及開發更多文創產品。

康文署計劃委聘專業營辦商（例如活動策劃公司），運用其市場和專業知識向目標客戶推廣合適的場地、為活動提供技術和後勤支援、為目標群體安排康文署博物館大型展覽的導賞專場，以及提供客戶管理服務。我們正擬備各項細節。

就鯉魚門公園度假營及指定試點營運沙灘而言，康文署會透過邀請有興趣的商業機構或非牟利機構提交建議，以商業方式營運鯉魚門公園度假營，和發展試點泳灘成新興康樂休閒及水上活動設施。我們鼓勵有意營運者提出可行的方案。康文署正研究具體的市場營運模式，各項具體安排和收費需視乎活動性質和內容、場地條件等而定。上述計劃尚在研究階段中，康文署會適時評估成效，包括對服務質素、市民參與度及收入的影響等。

（二）過去五年，康文署轄下博物館的入場人次，以及館內設施的平均使用率見下表：





入場人次
			（萬）
館內設施（註二）
			平均使用率


二○二○至二一年度
85（註一）
76.2%


二○二一至二二年度
327（註一）
78.6%


二○二二至二三年度
437（註一）
76.2%


二○二三至二四年度
700
77.3%


二○二四至二五年度
766
69.5%



註一：受到2019冠狀病毒病疫情影響，康文署轄下博物館及場地於二○二○年至二○二二年期間間歇地暫停開放。
註二：館內設施指除展覽館及展覽廳外的設施，包括演講廳、活動室、劇院等。

康文署轄下的博物館為市民提供普及的文化教育及公共服務，並非單以商業營利為目的。現時除香港科學館和香港太空館的常設展覽收取低額入場費（10元至20元）外，其他博物館的常設展覽均免費開放予市民參觀。康文署博物館的主要收入來源包括入場費及可租用設施的租用費、出售文創及文藝產品的收入、公眾節目如電影放映門票，以及商店和咖啡館的營運許可證／牌照費用的收入等。

康文署的博物館一直透過與本地文化創意產業品牌合作，推動文化藝術產業發展。舉例而言，我們於二○二五年與不同品牌推出聯乘產品，包括於六月的「香港非遺月2025」與文具品牌合作，邀請展能藝術家設計十款非遺項目的插畫，讓顧客打造自己獨特的筆記本；於七月與本地餅家聯乘推出三款限量禮盒，禮盒設計源自香港文化博物館及香港藝術館的館藏，結合百年餅藝與博物館美學。另外，就推廣十一月的香港博物館節，我們分別與兩個本地品牌合作，聯乘推出以博物館內容為題材的拼裝積木及食品。

康文署持續為轄下博物館舉辦的展覽引入嶄新的科技元素，並設置打卡位及沉浸式展品，提升參觀人士的觀賞體驗。例如，現正於香港文化博物館舉行的「漫眾同樂──幽默港漫格格趣」展覽，以沉浸式投影節目、漫畫觀賞互動裝置、AI生成影像體驗及與漫畫人物同框打卡的互動裝置等，為參觀人士帶來創新、富啟發性和教育性的博物館體驗。至於剛於今年九月開幕的「嶺南風範：趙少昂誕辰一百二十周年紀念展」，香港文化博物館利用趙少昂教授筆下的嶺南風物及花鳥，創造了一個沉浸式的數碼花海，引領參觀人士走進大師畫作中生機蓬勃和色彩絢爛的嶺南花境。另外，現正於香港藝術館舉行的「鑑古識今──敏求精舍六十五周年」展覽，亦以全息影像科技把文物立體呈現，讓參觀人士與展品互動，增加對文物的興趣與認識。

（三）康文署致力推廣「普及體育」的文化，透過提供不同種類的康樂體育設施，鼓勵市民建立健康生活模式。康文署的收費康樂設施（例如健身室、運動場及草地足球場）開放時間一般為上午七時至晚上十一時；而非收費設施（例如全港公園及遊樂場內約900套戶外健身器材），則大多24小時開放。現時康樂體育設施的開放時間安排已照顧大部分人士的需要。調整開放時間（包括將健身室通宵開放）將涉及額外的公共資源，署方暫未有計劃推行。

在設施管理和運作方面，康文署一直運用科技提升效率及服務質素，例如於二○二三年推出的智能康體服務預訂資訊系統SmartPLAY具備專題網頁及流動應用程式，方便市民隨時隨地登入個人帳戶、搜尋及預訂康體設施，或報名參加康體活動。康文署會繼續持開放態度積極探討運用科技協助管理康體設施，為市民提供更優質的康樂服務。

（四）康文署正在公園設施引入科技元素，以優化市民的體驗。舉例而言，為了提供更多新穎及適合不同年齡人士的戶外健身設施，康文署正在四個戶外康樂場地推展試行計劃，安裝具智能元素的戶外健身站，讓使用者可在使用智能健身設施後存取個人運動數據及健康資訊，方便管理個人健康、監察個人體質和增加運動的樂趣，從而鼓勵市民恆常運動。首個設於維多利亞公園的智能健身站已於二○二五年三月開放予市民使用，而位於大角咀海輝道海濱花園、九龍仔公園和屯門海珠路遊樂場的智能健身站預計於本年度內投入服務。"
Speech by Acting SJ at Annual Conference of In-House Lawyers 2025 (English only) (with photo),2025-10-22 12:46,2025-10-22 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200368.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Acting Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, at the Annual Conference of In-House Lawyers 2025 today (October 22):

President Tong, (President of the Law Society of Hong Kong, Mr Roden Tong), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. I am honoured to be here at the Annual Conference of In-House Lawyers 2025. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the In-House Lawyers Committee of the Law Society of Hong Kong for the invitation and for hosting this important event. With participants from diverse industries and jurisdictions, we bring together the brightest minds of the legal profession here today, which will surely enrich our discussions throughout the Conference.

  This year's theme, ""The Future of Lawyers: Innovation, Strategy, and Resilience"", captures a moment of profound significance. It reflects the evolving nature of the legal field, driven by technological advancements, shifting client expectations, and a dynamic global marketplace. These changes present both challenges and opportunities.

  As in-house lawyers, you stand at the forefront of this exciting transformation. Your role extends beyond traditional legal advisors; you are also strategic innovators within your organisations.

  In January, the Department of Justice made a significant move to advance lawtech by establishing the Consultation Group on LawTech Development. Building on their recommendations, we will progressively promote technology in the legal industry through a three-stage approach, with the aim of enhancing the efficiency and quality of professional services and strengthening Hong Kong's position as an international legal services and dispute resolution centre in the Asia-Pacific region.

  Phase one, which has already begun, focuses on raising awareness and education of lawtech within the legal profession by organising roundtables and events, to be accompanied by a roadmap, ethical and security guidelines. To prepare law students for the digital age, we work with stakeholders in legal education to enhance training on lawtech.

  Phase two will engage the legal profession with lawtech products through exhibitions and market surveys. This will help firms find solutions that support their business growth.

Finally, phase three will encourage local and international lawtech enterprises to establish a presence in Hong Kong, fostering a vibrant lawtech ecosystem. We will also periodically review the legal framework to ensure it supports and regulates new legal technologies effectively.

  Turning to the theme of the Conference, let's first talk about innovation in legal practice. Technology is now a vital part of legal work. From AI assisting in contract analysis to blockchain enhancing transaction security, the tools at our disposal are transforming how we manage cases. By using these innovations, we can work more efficiently, cut costs, and provide better services.

  Next, innovation must be strategic. In-house lawyers are not only legal advisors but also key contributors to their organisations' strategic direction. This means understanding the broader issues and context in which they operate, aligning legal strategies with organisational objectives, and proactively identifying and mitigating legal risks.

As in-house lawyers, you must rigorously evaluate not only the technological solutions available but also the specific needs of your organisation. Tailoring these innovations to your unique context will ensure that they serve to maximise your professional capabilities.

  Finally, let us talk about resilience - the ability to adapt amid challenges. The legal landscape is filled with uncertainties, from regulatory changes, evolving market dynamics, to emerging competitors. We must cultivate resilience within our teams and organisations by fostering an environment that encourages creativity, and supporting colleagues in developing skills that complement technological advancements.

  In the Greater China region and beyond, we are witnessing a significant transformation in the legal landscape. The convergence of industries and the rise of cross-border transactions require in-house lawyers to be well-versed in international laws and regulations. This Conference presents an excellent opportunity to connect with peers across different sectors and jurisdictions, exchanging best practices and insights that can enhance our collective capabilities.

  As we move through today's panel discussions, we will be engaging in interesting discussions on the future of legal practice, the implications of AI, and the ever-evolving landscape of data governance. I encourage all of you to join in, share your thoughts, and challenge the status quo. Together, we can forge a path forward that not only meets today's challenges but also prepares us for the future.

  To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, as an in-house lawyer, I am excited to see how each of you will harness innovation, strategy and resilience to enhance your legal practice. Once again, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Law Society of Hong Kong for organising this very special event to bring all these legal talents together. I wish you all a successful, enjoyable and fruitful discussion at the Conference. Thank you very much."
​立法會十八題：發展紅磡渡輪碼頭,2025-10-22 12:25,2025-10-22 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200250.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上李慧琼議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，紅磡渡輪碼頭（該碼頭）交通便利、景觀優美，具備發展成為集交通、休閒及文創於一體的海濱樞紐潛力；然而，目前該碼頭整體功能未獲充分發揮，其上層空間仍未開放予公眾使用，令部分設施閒置，浪費土地資源。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否檢視該碼頭的土地及設施的運用，並研究引入更多商業及休閒元素，以配合周邊地區發展，推動海濱經濟及社區共融；

（二）會否考慮加強該碼頭與相鄰海濱地段的規劃銜接，例如與黃埔、九龍城區及尖沙咀東的協同發展，打造更具連貫性的海濱步道及商業動線；

（三）在提升海上旅遊方面，會否研究如何強化該碼頭的對外交通配套，以同時增強紅磡與香港島之間的旅遊及交通連繫；及

（四）會否考慮開放該碼頭上層予公眾使用，並引入具教育及文化價值的活動項目，例如展示國家建設成就的圖片展覽，或舉辦青年文創工作坊及音樂匯演，為市民提供更多元化、具社區感及文化氣息的海濱體驗？

答覆：

主席：

為便利渡輪服務的日常運作，政府為大部分持牌渡輪航線提供渡輪碼頭。紅磡渡輪碼頭分為紅磡（南）及紅磡（北）渡輪碼頭，分別由富裕小輪有限公司營辦的「中環－紅磡」持牌渡輪航線及新渡輪服務有限公司營辦的「北角－紅磡」持牌渡輪航線提供服務。

政府一直與海濱事務委員會緊密合作，推動各項優化維港海濱的工作，為公眾營造多元、活力、暢達和共融的海濱空間，包括毗鄰紅磡渡輪碼頭一帶的海濱用地。

就李慧琼議員的提問，經諮詢發展局及文化體育及旅遊局後，現回覆如下：

（一）為推動海濱經濟，規劃署於二○二五年八月向城市規劃委員會（城規會）建議修訂紅磡（南）及紅磡（北）渡輪碼頭在相關分區計劃大綱圖上的用途，將「商店及服務行業」和「食肆」用途改為經常准許的用途，以簡化發展流程及提供彈性，便利營商。九龍城區議會及海濱事務委員會相關小組早前均已表示支持擬議修訂。

政府一直鼓勵渡輪營辦商在符合核准土地用途的前提下，將碼頭地方分租作商業、零售和活動等用途，以賺取非票務收入補貼渡輪的營運，從而紓緩加價壓力。

就紅磡渡輪碼頭而言，運輸署一直積極統籌各工務部門持續提升該碼頭的設施，包括翻新洗手間及增設無障礙設施，以拓展碼頭的發展潛力，從而進一步提升碼頭用作非票務收入活動的空間；政府產業署亦會統籌處理營辦商提交的碼頭商業活動申請。

（二）發展局致力推動優化維港海濱的工作，包括駁通海濱段落及提供優質海濱休憩空間。現時，由尖沙咀渡輪碼頭至紅磡海逸豪園對開的海濱已全面貫通。發展局會繼續致力打通九龍其他不同的海濱地段，目標是於二○二八年年底駁通尖沙咀至啟德一帶近八成半（即約13公里）可發展海濱。

另外，毗鄰紅磡渡輪碼頭、前身為紅磡碼頭公共運輸交匯處的用地，已改建成紅磡都市公園，並於今年七月全面開放。公園以北用地由非牟利機構以短期租約形式營運兒童遊樂設施，亦即將向公眾開放，提供更多遊樂設施和空間舉辦不同活動，為紅磡一帶海濱引入更共融、更具活力的元素。

與此同時，發展局正牽頭推動港鐵紅磡站周邊和海濱一帶用地的發展，在今年第二季就用地公布了初步發展建議。把握重新規劃的契機，初步發展建議包括多項加強行人暢達度的建議，以帶動有關用地與附近周邊區域的協同發展，當中包括興建有蓋高架行人天橋，直接連繫港鐵紅磡站及海濱；以及興建行人板道，加強尖沙咀海濱長廊與紅磡海濱長廊的連接，並優化海濱與內陸的行人連接。發展局正為擬議發展進行詳細技術評估，以深化發展建議及敲定詳細發展參數。在過程中，項目團隊會考慮早前在公眾諮詢期間所收集到的意見。目標是在二○二六年下半年開展相關的法定程序。在開展長遠發展的工程前，發展局會善用現時閒置的前紅磡鐵路貨運碼頭用地作短期用途，發展成為可舉辦不同活動的海濱空間，讓市民「打卡」並欣賞270度維港景色及香港島的天際線。

（三）紅磡渡輪碼頭毗鄰紅磡（紅鸞道）公共運輸交匯處，同時距離黃埔花園公共運輸交匯處亦僅約十分鐘步程，設有往返港島、九龍及新界多個地區的專營巴士及專線小巴服務。就紅磡與港島的交通接駁，紅磡渡輪碼頭提供「北角－紅磡」及「中環－紅磡」持牌渡輪航線服務，為市民提供水路交通選擇。陸路交通方面，市民可在紅磡（紅鸞道）公共運輸交匯處乘搭專線小巴第13M號線（紅磡碼頭—紅磡站）至港鐵紅磡站，轉乘港鐵東鐵線前往港島；或在黃埔花園公共運輸交匯處，乘搭隧巴第115號或115P號線（海逸豪園往中環（港澳碼頭））前往港島。運輸署會密切留意乘客就紅磡渡輪碼頭對外公共運輸服務的需求，並適時與各營辦商檢視相關安排。

旅遊配套方面，維港是香港最具代表性的景點之一，現時已有一些商業營運的海上旅遊項目供旅客參與，從維港兩岸不同登岸設施上落的觀賞船暢遊維港，部分更提供餐飲服務，讓旅客在欣賞維港美景的同時品嚐美食，感受香港獨特魅力。

旅遊事務署和香港旅遊發展局會繼續善用海濱長廊和水體打造更多盛事和旅遊體驗，並致力推動、促成和協助不同旅遊盛事和活動在維港兩岸舉行。

（四）現時，紅磡渡輪碼頭上層的土地用途容許作商店及服務行業之用。運輸署正積極與渡輪營辦商商討，以協助其開放紅磡渡輪碼頭上層作商業、零售或活動等用途。

就紅磡（南）渡輪碼頭上層空間，渡輪營辦商已物色有意分租該空間作零售及服務用途的潛在租戶，並預期於稍後向政府提出有關申請。

就紅磡（北）渡輪碼頭上層空間，渡輪營辦商有意把該空間改劃作展覽廳、商店及服務行業用途，並已獲得城規會的有條件批准。就此，運輸署正積極協調相關政府部門聯同渡輪營辦商研究於碼頭裝設合適的消防系統，預計有關技術研究及設計於二○二六年第一季完成，並會在下一步評估方案細節和可行性等事宜。

運輸署會繼續與渡輪營辦商就紅磡渡輪碼頭的運作及發展保持密切溝通，包括鼓勵營辦商繼續利用碼頭拓展其非票務收入，並視乎情況考慮引入具教育及文化價值的活動項目。"
LCQ18: Development of Hung Hom Ferry Pier  ,2025-10-22 12:25,2025-10-22 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200253.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Starry Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

  There are views that with its convenient transport links and scenic view, Hung Hom Ferry Pier (the Pier) has the potential to develop into a waterfront hub integrating transport, leisure, culture and creativity. However, the Pier as a whole is not being used to its full functionality, as evidenced by its upper deck area still being closed to public use, which results in the idling of some facilities and wasting of land resources. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will examine the utilisation of land and facilities at the Pier and explore introducing more commercial and leisure elements to tie in with the development of the surrounding areas, thereby promoting waterfront economy and community integration;

(2) whether it will consider enhancing the planning interface between the Pier and adjacent waterfront areas, such as through synergistic development with Whampoa, Kowloon City District and Tsim Sha Tsui East, to create a waterfront promenade and commercial circulation route with greater coherence;

(3) regarding the uplift of maritime tourism, whether it will explore how to strengthen the external transport facilities for the Pier, thereby simultaneously enhancing tourism and transport linkages between Hung Hom and Hong Kong Island; and

(4) whether it will consider opening up the upper deck of the Pier for public use and introducing activities of educational and cultural value, such as photo exhibitions showcasing the national achievements in construction, or organisation of youth cultural and creative workshops and music galas, to offer the public a more diverse waterfront experience characterized by a sense of community and a cultural vibe?

Reply:

President,

  To facilitate the daily operation of ferry services, the Government provides ferry piers for most of the licensed ferry routes. Hong Hom Ferry Pier comprises Hung Hom (South) and Hung Hom (North) Ferry Piers, serving the ""Central – Hung Hom"" licensed ferry route operated by the Fortune Ferry Company Limited and the ""North Point – Hung Hom"" licensed ferry route operated by the Sun Ferry Services Company Limited respectively.

  The Government has been working closely with the Harbourfront Commission to promote various initiatives to enhance the Victoria Harbourfront, including the harbourfront area in proximity to Hung Hom Ferry Pier, with a view to creating a diversified, vibrant, accessible and inclusive harbourfront space for the public.

  In consultation with the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, my reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Starry Lee is as follows:

(1) To promote harbourfront economy, the Planning Development proposed to the Town Planning Board (TPB) in August 2025 an amendment to the uses within Hung Hom (South) and Hung Hom (North) Ferry Piers on the outline zoning plan concerned by making the uses of ""Shop and Services"" and ""Eating Place"" always permitted, so as to streamline the development process and provide flexibility in facilitation of business operations. The Kowloon City District Council and the relevant task force of the Harbourfront Commission have already expressed their support to the proposed amendment.

  The Government has all along encouraged ferry operators to sublet pier premises for purposes such as commercial, retail and event, under the approved land uses to generate non-farebox revenue for cross-subsidising ferry operations and thereby alleviating the pressure on fare increase.

  Regarding Hung Hom Ferry Pier, the Transport Department (TD) has been actively coordinating with various works departments to continuously enhance the pier's facilities, including renovating the toilets and adding barrier-free facilities, so as to expand the pier's development potential and further enhance its capacity for non-fare revenue activities. The Government Property Agency also coordinates the processing of applications for commercial activities at the pier submitted by the operators.

(2) The DEVB is committed to taking forward harbourfront enhancements at Victoria Harbour, including connecting the harbourfront sections and providing quality harbourfront open spaces. At present, the harbourfront between Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier and Laguna Verde in Hung Hom has been fully connected. The DEVB will continue to connect other harbourfront sections in Kowloon, with the target of connecting around 85 per cent (i.e. approximately 13 kilometres) of the developable promenade from Tsim Sha Tsui to Kai Tak by the end of 2028.

  Besides, the site that was previously a public transport interchange near Hung Hom Ferry Pier has already been transformed into the Hung Hom Urban Park, which was fully opened in July this year. A site to the north of the park will be operated by a non-profit-making organisation by way of short-term tenancy for the provision of children's play facilities and opened to the public shortly. The site will provide more leisure facilities and space for hosting different activities, thereby injecting more harmonious and vibrant elements into the harbourfront in Hung Hom.

  At the same time, the DEVB is spearheading the development at the sites around MTR Hung Hom Station and its waterfront areas, and released the preliminary development proposal for the sites in the second quarter of this year. Taking the opportunity of re-planning, the preliminary development proposal includes several measures to strengthen the pedestrian connectivity with a view to driving the co-development of the concerned sites and the nearby areas. These include, for example, building a covered and elevated footbridge spanning to directly connect MTR Hung Hom Station with the harbourfront, constructing a new boardwalk to better connect the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront promenade with the Hung Hom waterfront promenade, as well as enhancing the pedestrian connectivity between the hinterland and waterfront. The DEVB is currently conducting detailed technical assessments for the proposed development so as to finalise the development proposal and detailed development parameters. During the process, the project team will consider the views collected during the public consultation conducted earlier. The aim is to commence the relevant statutory procedures for the project in the second half of 2026. Before commencing the works of the long-term development, the DEVB will make good use of the currently idle former Hung Hom Railway Freight Yard Pier site for short-term use, developing it into a harbourfront space for hosting various activities such that the public may check in and appreciate the 270-degree panoramic views of Victoria Harbour and the skyline of Hong Kong Island.

(3) Hung Hom Ferry Pier is situated adjacent to Hung Hom (Hung Luen Road) Public Transport Interchange, and is also only about a 10-minute walk from Whampoa Garden Public Transport Interchange. These interchanges offer franchised bus and green minibus (GMB) services connecting to various districts across Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories. Regarding transport connectivity between Hung Hom and Hong Kong Island, Hung Hom Ferry Pier offers licensed ferry services of the ""North Point – Hung Hom"" and ""Central – Hung Hom"" routes, providing waterborne transport options for the public. In terms of land transport, members of the public may take GMB Route No. 13M (Hung Hom Ferry Pier – Hung Hom Station) from Hung Hom (Hung Luen Road) Public Transport Interchange to MTR Hung Hom Station, and then interchange with the MTR East Rail Line towards Hong Kong Island. Alternatively, passengers may take Cross-Harbour Route No. 115 or 115P (from Laguna Verde to Central (Hong Kong – Macau Ferry Terminal)) at Whampoa Garden Public Transport Interchange to travel to Hong Kong Island. The TD will closely monitor the passenger demand for external public transport services at Hung Hom Ferry Pier and review arrangements with the operators as appropriate.

  Regarding ancillary tourism facilities, Victoria Harbour is one of the most iconic attractions in Hong Kong. Currently, there are some commercially operated aquatic tourism offerings, with sightseeing vessels embarking and disembarking at various landing facilities along both sides of Victoria Harbour for visitors to tour around Victoria Harbour. Some sightseeing vessels even provide dining services, allowing visitors to savour delicacies while enjoying the stunning view of Victoria Harbour and experiencing the unique attractiveness of Hong Kong.

  The Tourism Commission and the Hong Kong Tourism Board will continue to leverage the waterfront promenades and water bodies to develop more mega events and travel experiences, and spare no effort in promoting and facilitating the staging of various tourism mega events and activities along both sides of Victoria Harbour.

(4) Currently, the land uses of the upper deck of Hung Hom Ferry Pier allow the purposes of shops and services. The TD is in active discussions with ferry operators to assist them in opening the upper deck of Hung Hom Ferry Pier for purposes such as commercial, retail or event, etc.

  For the upper deck of Hung Hom (South) Ferry Pier, the ferry operator has identified potential tenants interested in subletting the area for retail and services purposes and is anticipated to submit an application to the Government shortly.

  For the upper deck of Hung Hom (North) Ferry Pier, the ferry operator plans to convert the area for exhibition hall, retail and services purposes, and has obtained conditional approval from the TPB. In this regard, the TD is actively co-ordinating with relevant Government departments and the ferry operator to study the installation of appropriate fire service systems at the pier. The technical study and design are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026, followed with an evaluation of matters such as the details and feasibility of the plan, etc.

  The TD will continue to maintain close communication with the ferry operators regarding the operation and development of Hung Hom Ferry Pier, including encouraging operators to continue utilise the pier to expand non-farebox revenue and consider introducing activities with educational and cultural value where appropriate."
立法會十九題：鼓勵人才留港發展的措施,2025-10-22 12:20,2025-10-22 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200268.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上陳振英議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，雖然香港在國際管理發展學院最新發布的《2025年世界人才排名》中躍升至全球第四位，但在鼓勵人才留港發展方面仍存在結構性短板，尤其香港的生活成本高昂，令其在「生活成本」指標上的表現不佳，在全球排名第66位，因此政府應推出相應的長遠措施吸引和留住人才。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）為降低住房成本壓力，政府會否考慮在北部都會區等新發展區域預留部分土地，參考外國經驗以build-to-rent模式（即專為出租而建造房屋的模式）興建人才公寓，為來港人才提供穩定而可負擔的住屋選擇，以增加他們長期定居香港的誘因，從而促進本地經濟發展；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（二）鑑於有意見指出，培養本地人才的多種語言能力對提升其國際競爭力至關重要，政府會否考慮設立外語獎學金計劃，資助計劃在港長遠發展的本地學生或青年到海外修讀語言課程，以培育具跨文化素養及專業外語水平的本地人才；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就議員的提問，經諮詢發展局及教育局後，現答覆如下：

（一）北部都會區（北都）是香港的戰略發展區域，面積和未來人口約佔香港的三分之一，當中的產業用地推動創新科技以至其他產業發展。在相關政策局的支持下，發展局已在北都一些新發展區（如新田科技城和流浮山一帶）的產業用地，預留規劃彈性容許興建人才公寓，以配合有關的產業發展。

（二）政府一直大力投資教育，為學生提供多元化的學習機會。學習外語有助學生認識多元文化，並藉此加強與世界不同地方的連繫，提高他們日後投身工作、進修或創業的競爭力。政府一直鼓勵院校為學生提供學習外語的機會，並透過學生交流計劃及體驗學習等不同途徑，讓學生接觸更多地方的文化，擴闊視野，抓緊香港的獨特優勢，為未來發展作更好準備。多年來，政府與語文教育及研究常務委員會、其他諮詢組織和持份者通力合作，通過運用語文基金資助並推行不同的措施，以培育香港人，特別是學生及就業人士，兩文三語的能力。政府會繼續致力培育精通兩文三語及其他語言的人才，惟現時未有計劃設立問題所建議的外語獎學金計劃。"
LCQ19: Measures to encourage talents to stay in Hong Kong for development,2025-10-22 12:20,2025-10-22 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200333.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Chun-ying and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

  There are views that although Hong Kong has leapt to the fourth place globally in the latest World Talent Ranking 2025 published by the International Institute for Management Development, it still has structural shortcomings in encouraging talent to stay and develop in Hong Kong. In particular, Hong Kong's high cost of living has resulted in poor performance in the ""cost of living"" indicator, with the city ranking 66th globally. Therefore, the Government should introduce corresponding long-term measures to attract and retain talent. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) in order to alleviate housing cost pressures, whether the Government will consider reserving land in new development areas such as the Northern Metropolis and, by drawing on overseas experience, constructing residential apartments for talent under the ""build-‍to-‍rent"" model (i.e. a model where housing is specifically constructed for rental purposes) to provide stable and affordable housing options for incoming talent, so as to increase the incentive for their long-term settlement in Hong Kong, thereby promoting local economic development; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(2) as there are views pointing out that cultivating multilingual abilities is crucial to enhancing the international competitiveness of local talent, whether the Government will consider establishing a Foreign Language Scholarship Scheme to subsidise local students or young people planning for long-term development in Hong Kong to attend language courses overseas, so as to nurture local talent with cross-cultural literacy and professional foreign language proficiency; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  Our reply to the Member's questions, in consultation with the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Education Bureau, is as follows:

(1) The Northern Metropolis (NM) is a strategic development area in Hong Kong. With an area and planned population accounting for around one-third of Hong Kong's totals, the land for different industries in the NM would drive the development of innovation and technology and other industries. With the support of relevant policy bureaux, the DEVB has allowed planning flexibility for the construction of talent accommodation on industry land in some New Development Areas (such as San Tin Technopole and the Lau Fau Shan area) in the NM, with a view to supporting the relevant industry development.

(2) The Government has been making significant investment in educationto provide diversified learning opportunities for students. Learning foreign languages can help students understand multiculturalism and strengthen their connections with different parts of the world, thereby enhancing their competitiveness in pursuing employment or further studies, or starting their own businesses in the future. The Government has consistently encouraged schools and institutions to provide students with opportunities to learn foreign languages, and enable students, through various avenues such as student exchange programmes and experiential learning activities, to gain exposure to the cultures of more places, broaden their horizons, seize Hong Kong's unique advantages, and be better prepared for their future development. Over the years, the Government has been collaborating with the Standing Committee on Language Education and Research, other advisory bodies and stakeholders to enable Hong Kong people, particularly students and working adults, to become biliterate and trilingual, through sponsoring and implementing various measures using the Language Fund.The Government will continue to strive to nurture talents who are biliterate and trilingual, and proficient in other languages. However, there is currently no plan to introduce the Foreign Language Scholarship Scheme as proposed in the question."

今年聯合會議聚焦討論各成員經濟體如何通過政策協調、監管改革、能力建設與區域合作，把握人工智能與數字化轉型帶來的機遇，並應對相關挑戰。陳茂波與律政司司長林定國資深大律師一同出席會議。

陳茂波在會上發言，分享中國香港在發展人工智能和推動數字轉型方面的經驗，並就亞太經合組織在這方面的推動工作提出建議。他表示，人工智能與數字轉型是當前最具變革性的力量之一，而中國香港提出了「發展人工智能作為核心產業」和「以人工智能賦能產業發展」的雙重策略，並圍繞五大重點領域推進：算力、算法、應用場景、數據和資金支持。

陳茂波指出，中國香港在創新與科研方面已投入超過2,000億港元，其中支持人工智能發展的重點工作，包括設立香港人工智能研發院，推動人工智能的上游創新及跨行業應用；並於去年成立人工智能超算中心，通過資助計劃支持大學、科研機構和企業使用算力資源。

在監管與治理方面，香港致力於建立負責任的人工智能發展框架，當中包括發布了在金融市場負責任地應用人工智能的政策宣言，和以國際最佳做法為本的《人工智能道德框架》和《香港生成式人工智能技術及應用指引》。在政府應用方面，香港特區政府內部成立了「AI效能提升組」，通過有效應用人工智能技術以優化工作流程，並建設「數碼企業身份」平台，提升公共服務效率和數字化水平。

他指出，面對未來，提升全民的人工智能素養至關重要。中國香港致力把人工智能融入各級教育課程中，並拓展專業培訓項目，全面提升勞動人口應對人工智能時代的能力；同時，積極吸引全球相關領域的頂尖人才來港發展。此外，中國香港亦高度重視中小企業的數字化轉型，推出多項資助計劃及支援措施，協助企業應用新興科技，提升競爭力。

最後，陳茂波提出亞太經合組織應在三個方面加強合作：第一，加強能力建設、知識和經驗共享與技術支援，特別是協助新興與發展中經濟體跨過數字鴻溝；第二，深化數字治理合作，推動就人工智能監管框架、跨境數據流動及數字貿易等議題的政策對話；第三，合力建設區域創新科技生態，支持初創企業發展及跨境研發合作。他強調，中國香港願與各成員經濟體加強協作，共同推動新興科技為區域民眾和經濟發展帶來實質裨益。

問題：

據報截至今年九月下旬，警方對駕駛未領有出租汽車許可證非法取酬載客的車輛（俗稱白牌車），已進行95次執法行動。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）上述95次執法行動中，（i）有多少名人士被法庭定罪，以及有關的判罰分別為何（包括罰款金額及涉案司機有否被罰停牌），以及（ii）有多少部涉案車輛被扣押，以及其扣押時間分別為何；

答覆：

主席：

就李鎮強議員的問題各部分，經諮詢律政司、香港警務處及運輸署後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（二）政府決心打擊非法出租或取酬載客，以保障市民的安全和利益，近年更加強打擊力度。警務處持續在各區採取執法行動，在二○二五年（截至九月）已緝獲97宗個案，涉及在不同平台提供非法載客取酬服務的車輛，相比二○二四年全年的47宗已倍增。在上述個案中，有39宗案件已經由法庭定罪，涉及39名司機。另外七宗已進入司法程序，而其餘51宗案件正在調查中。

在上述被定罪的案件當中，涉案司機被判罰款1,200元至6,000元不等。而其中個別涉及違反逗留條件的司機，除了罰款之外，更加被判監禁兩星期至兩個月不等。另外，有24名司機被取消駕駛執照12至15個月不等。

根據《檢控守則》，律政司可基於判刑在法律上或原則上出錯，或判刑明顯過輕，向法庭申請覆核判刑。是否申請覆核判刑建基於每宗案件的事實和情況。律政司以往沒有就非法出租或取酬載客罪行的判刑向法庭申請覆核判刑。

根據現時《道路交通條例》（第374章）（《條例》），如有人就《條例》第52（3）條（即非法出租或取酬載客）的罪行被定罪，運輸署署長會根據《條例》暫時吊銷涉事車輛的車輛牌照，並指示車主把車輛移交署長保管（即提問所指的扣押），吊銷期為六個月（首次定罪）或12個月（再次定罪）。二○二五年被判定罪的個案中，有20輛車輛已被扣押或已排期扣押六個月，其餘案件正在處理中。

（三）為加強非法出租或取酬載客罪行罰則的阻嚇力，政府已於二○二三年十二月透過《2023年道路交通法例（提升個人化點對點交通服務）（修訂）條例》提高有關利用汽車作非法出租或取酬載客用途的罰則，包括提高最高罰款額和最高監禁期，以及延長暫時吊銷車輛牌照和扣押車輛的期限，詳情如下。

（四）政府將透過剛於十月十五日獲立法會通過的《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》（《條例草案》）進一步加強針對非法出租或取酬載客的罰則，訂明被定罪的司機須被取消駕駛執照至少12個月，並可長達三年；以及強化暫時吊銷相關車輛牌照及扣押車輛的安排，讓政府在未能識辨涉事司機以作出刑事檢控的情況下，仍然有機制可扣押涉案車輛，加強阻嚇力。

上述有關執法的新條文將配合《條例草案》其他部分的生效時間，在持牌網約車投入服務時生效，從而整體保障合法合規個人化點對點交通服務和乘客。

同時，政府會繼續加強執法工作，在各區打擊非法出租或取酬載客。運輸署亦會加強宣傳相關罰則，提醒司機切勿以身試法，以及提醒乘客使用非法出租汽車服務可能蒙受風險，因為當發生交通事故時，提供非法服務的車輛的第三者責任保險可能會失效。"
LCQ17: Combating activities of illegal carriage of passengers for reward,2025-10-22 11:55,2025-10-22 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200224.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Lee Chun-keung and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

  It has been reported that as at late September this year, the Police have conducted 95 enforcement actions against vehicles without a valid hire car permit being used for illegal carriage of passengers for reward (commonly known as white licence cars). In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) among the aforesaid 95 enforcement actions, (i) of the number of persons convicted by the court and the respective penalties (including fine amounts and whether the drivers involved were suspended from driving), and (ii) the number of subject vehicles which were detained and their respective detention periods;

(2) whether the Department of Justice has lodged appeals against any of the aforesaid cases in which the penalties were considered relatively low; if so, of the number of such appeal cases and their outcomes; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) whether, following the increase in penalties for offences relating to white licence cars under the Road Traffic Legislation (Enhancing Personalized Point-to-point Transport Services) (Amendment) Ordinance 2023, which came into operation in December 2023, the Government has compiled statistics on and compared the penalties imposed by the court for such offences before and after the commencement of the Ordinance (set out in a table); and

(4) as the Government expects that, after the passage of the Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025, the first batch of licensed ride-hailing platforms will only commence operation in the fourth quarter of 2026 at the earliest, of the plans of the law enforcement agencies to step up efforts to combat white licence cars in the coming year when licensed ride-hailing platforms are not yet available?

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Transport Department (TD), a consolidated reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Lee Chun-keung is provided as follows:

(1) and (2) The Government is determined to combat illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward with a view to safeguarding the safety and interests of the public. To this end, enforcement efforts have been strengthened in recent years. The HKPF has continued to take enforcement actions in various districts, where 97 cases were detected in 2025 (by September), involving the provision of illegal services of carriage of passengers for reward by vehicles through different platforms, representing a doubling of the 47 cases detected in the whole year of 2024. Of the abovementioned cases, 39 cases involving 39 drivers have been convicted by the court. Seven cases have entered judicial proceedings, while the remaining 51 cases are under investigation.

  Of the convicted cases, fines ranging from $1,200 to $6,000 were imposed on the drivers involved. Individual drivers involved in breach of condition of stay were, in addition to fines, sentenced to imprisonment ranging from two weeks to two months. Moreover, 24 drivers have been disqualified from driving for 12 to 15 months.

  According to the Prosecution Code, the DoJ may apply to the court for the review of a sentence on the basis that it has proceeded on an error of law or of principle or that it is manifestly inadequate. Whether an application for the review of a sentence will be made is based upon the facts and circumstances of each and every case. The DoJ has not made any application to the court for a review of sentences in relation to the offences of illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward.

  Under the existing Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374) (the Ordinance), if a person is convicted of the offence under section 52(3) of the Ordinance (i.e. illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward), the Commissioner for Transport will, in accordance with the Ordinance, suspend the vehicle licence of the vehicle involved and instruct the vehicle owner to deliver the vehicle to the Commissioner's custody (i.e. detention as referred to in the question). The suspension period is either six months (for first conviction) or 12 months (for subsequent conviction). Of the convicted cases in 2025, 20 vehicles have been impounded or scheduled for impoundment for six months, while the remaining cases are under process.

(3) To enhance the deterrent effect of the penalties for the offences of illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward, the Government in December 2023 increased the penalties for offences relating to illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward by motor vehicles through the enactment of the Road Traffic Legislation (Enhancing Personalized Point-to-point Transport Services) (Amendment) Ordinance 2023. These included increasing the maximum fine and term of imprisonment, as well as lengthening the period of suspension of vehicle licences and impoundment of vehicles, with details as follows:

Table 1: Details of the legislative amendments made in December 2023

Since the commencement of the legislative amendments on December 22, 2023, the average amount of fines imposed and the number of cases on which imprisonment was imposed for offences relating to illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward by motor vehicles have increased, with details as follows:

Table 2: Comparison of penalties imposed before and after the legislative amendments in December 2023

Suspension of vehicle licences and impoundment of vehicles
Impoundment of vehicle for three months was imposed on
			29 cases
Impoundment of vehicle for six months was imposed on
			58 cases



* In addition to the contravention of section 52(3) of the Ordinance, the cases also involved a contravention of section 4 of the Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinance (Cap. 272) and section 41 of the Immigration Ordinance (Cap. 115).

(4) The Government will further strengthen the penalties against illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward through the Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025 (the Bill), which was just passed by the Legislative Council on October 15. The Bill specifies that convicted drivers should be disqualified from driving for not less than 12 months and not more than three years; and strengthens the arrangement for the suspension of vehicle licences and impoundment of vehicles, allowing a mechanism under which the Government may impound the vehicles involved even if the driver involved cannot be identified for the purpose of instituting criminal proceedings, thereby enhancing the deterrent effect.

  The aforementioned new provisions on enforcement will dovetail with the commencement date of other parts of the Bill and take effect when licensed ride-hailing vehicles commence service, so as to provide comprehensive protection for legally compliant point-to-point transport services and passengers.

  Meanwhile, the Government will continue to strengthen law enforcement across all districts to combat illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward. The TD will also step up its publicity efforts in reminding drivers of the relevant penalties and the need to abide by the law, while alerting passengers to the potential risks of using illegal hire car services as the third party liability insurance for the vehicle providing illegal services may become invalid in the event of a traffic accident."
Acting SFST's speech at Opening Ceremony of Green Tech Summit 2025 (English only) (with photo),2025-10-22 11:46,2025-10-22 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200293.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, at the Opening Ceremony of the Green Tech Summit 2025 today (October 22):

Helene (CEO & Co-Founder, GoImpact, Ms Helene Li), Clarence (Co-Founder, GoImpact, Mr Clarence T'ao), Andy (Co-Founder, GoImpact, Mr Andy Ann), Kevin (Chif Executive and Founder, Templaria and Advisory Board Member, GoImpact, Mr Kevin Angelini), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. It is my pleasure to address you at the Opening Ceremony of the Green Tech Summit 2025. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the organiser GoImpact and all participants, including esteemed partners such as the World Bank and the Climate Bonds Initiative, for your unwavering support in advancing green technology and sustainability. Your collective efforts are instrumental in driving our shared green finance and ESG (environmental, social and governance) ambitions, paving the way for a transformative journey towards a greener future.

 Hong Kong is steadfast in our commitment to sustainability, guided by the Central People's Government's 14th Five-Year Plan, which sets goals of peaking carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. Aligned with this vision, Hong Kong has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. These targets are not mere aspirations but a call to action, compelling us to leverage our position as a global financial centre to pioneer and drive innovative financing solutions that bridge environmental goals with financial expertise.

 Based on market research it is estimated that annual climate investments would have to reach US$9 trillion by 2030 and US$10 trillion by 2050. This demonstrates the immense demand for green and sustainable finance. As the leading international financial centre in Asia, Hong Kong is also rising as an international green and sustainable finance centre, playing our part in mobilising capital for green investments. In 2024, the total green and sustainable debt, including both bonds and loans, issued in Hong Kong exceeded US$84 billion, among which the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong amounted to around US$43 billion, capturing around 45 per cent of the regional total and ranking first in the Asian market for seven consecutive years since 2018. Our financial prowess enables us to fund transformative projects that align with our carbon neutrality objectives.

 The Government is also leading by example in the development of the green bond market. Under the Government Sustainable Bond Programme, we have issued green bonds totalling about HK$240 billion equivalent since May 2019. Notable milestones include the world's largest retail green bond in 2022 and the largest ESG bond issuance in Asia in 2023. To further advance innovation, we introduced the world's first tokenised government green bond of its kind in February 2023 and the world's first multi-tranche digitally native green bonds in 2024. Using the capital raised from the issuances, so far we have supported 116 local green projects across six eligible categories to deliver transparent and measurable environmental benefits.

 Financing aside, Hong Kong is actively promoting green finance by developing policies and frameworks to support sustainable investments, including ESG-focused financial products. The Government and the financial sector are collaborating to position the city as a leading global hub for green finance, attracting international capital to fund environmentally friendly projects. Hong Kong's status as a strategic nexus for green finance in Asia is central to advancing global sustainability objectives. As of June this year, there are more than 204 ESG funds in Hong Kong authorised by the SFC (Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong), with assets under management of around US$150 billion. This sizable market of ESG funds demonstrates Hong Kong's role as the gateway to sustainable finance in Asia, gathering capital to empower green transformation.

 Complementing these efforts and achievements, the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme, extended to 2027, has disbursed around HK$380 million to over 600 green and sustainable debt instruments issued in Hong Kong, with a total underlying debt issuance exceeding HK$1.3 trillion as of September this year. This scheme provides subsidy for eligible bond issuers and loan borrowers to cover part of their expenses on bond issuance and external review services, driving decarbonisation and reinforcing Hong Kong's leadership in transition financing.

 Technology application is another driving force for development, and Hong Kong is at the forefront of integrating financial technology with green finance. To accelerate the green transformation of our economy, we are expanding our green fintech ecosystem. In March 2024 and June 2025, the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group launched the Prototype Hong Kong Green Fintech Map and the Hong Kong Green Fintech Map 2025, respectively. Developed in collaboration with stakeholders, these platforms provide comprehensive information on green fintech companies and services in Hong Kong, elevating their visibility and impact and promoting business collaboration.

 To further support green fintech development, we launched the Green and Sustainable Fintech Proof-of-Concept Funding Support Scheme in June last year. This scheme provides early-stage funding to technology companies and research institutes collaborating with local enterprises to develop innovative green fintech solutions. A total of 39 applicants, involving 60 projects, were approved, each receiving a grant of HK$150,000 to facilitate commercialisation and proof-of-concept completion.

 On the journey towards green transformation, it is also important to empower our small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In partnership with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, our Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group launched the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions calculation and estimation tools in February last year. These tools, freely accessible on the Steering Group's website, empower small and medium enterprises and financial institutions to manage their environmental footprint and enhance sustainability reporting. The Steering Group will continue to enhance these public utility tools, including the GHG emissions tools and the Climate and Environmental Risk Questionnaire for non-listed companies and SMEs, to improve data availability throughout this year.

 Furthermore, we are also exploring real-world asset tokenisation for green finance development. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), is studying the application of tokenisation technology in carbon trading. The HKEX is also deepening pilot co-operation with the Greater Bay Area carbon market to test cross-border trade settlement mechanisms and build a regional carbon market ecosystem. In collaboration with Mainland regulatory authorities, we are also studying issues surrounding the country's participation in the international carbon market, including the formulation of voluntary carbon credit standards and methods, as well as the registration, trading and settlement of carbon emission reduction.

 Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong's leadership in green finance reflects our ability to unite vision, innovation, and collaboration. The Green Tech Summit 2025's focus on green technology mirrors our commitment to leveraging cutting-edge solutions for a sustainable future. From our ambitious carbon neutrality targets to our pioneering green financing and fintech innovations, every step we take builds a resilient and inclusive ecosystem. I urge you to join us in harnessing innovation to create a greener, more sustainable Hong Kong and beyond. Thank you."

LCQ14: Data reflecting Hong Kong's economic situation,2025-10-22 11:45,2025-10-22 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102100678.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Adrian Ho and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

 Regarding the data that reflects Hong Kong's economic situation, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the median monthly employment earnings of employed persons and the median monthly household income in Hong Kong, as well as the three industry sectors that recorded the highest growth rates in median monthly employment earnings, for the past four quarters (up to the last month); the number of those industry sectors in which the median monthly employment earnings of employed persons recorded an increase;

(2) given that the Government has raised the maximum value of properties chargeable to the $100 stamp duty to $4 million with effect from ‍February 26 this year, of the respective amounts of stamp duty revenue collected in respect of (i) property leases, (ii) agreements for sale and purchase, or (iii) transfers of residential and non-residential properties in the current financial year to date; the changes in such stamp duty revenues as compared with those of the same period last year;

(3) of the proportion of the financial services sector in the Gross Domestic Product and the stamp duty revenue related to stock transfers collected in the past two years; the change in such stamp duty revenue as compared with that of the same period last year;

(4) given that the Government has resumed the collection of hotel accommodation tax at a rate of 3 per cent on the accommodation charges with effect from January 1 this year, of the respective amounts of hotel accommodation tax collected by the Government each month up to the third quarter of this year; and

(5) of the amount of revenue received by the Government from business registration fees, and the number of applications for exemption from payment of business registration fee received since January this year?

Reply:

President,

 In response to the questions raised by the Hon Adrian Ho, after consulting the relevant government departments, my reply is as follows:

(1) The statistics on the median monthly employment earnings of employed persons and median monthly household income from Q3 2024 to Q2 2025 (excluding foreign domestic helpers) compiled based on the survey results of the General Household Survey of the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) are provided in Table 1. The statistics for Q3 2025 are still being compiled.

 The median monthly employment earnings of employed persons by industry of main employment (excluding foreign domestic helpers) during the same period are provided in Table 2. The three industries with the largest year-on-year increases in Q2 2025 were manufacturing sector (12.5 per cent); transportation, storage, postal and courier services, information and communications sector (7.3 per cent); as well as financing and insurance sector (5.3 per cent). The industries which recorded a year-on-year growth in median monthly employment earnings include the construction sector; import/export trade and wholesale sector; real estate and professional and business services sector; accommodation and food services sector; and public administration, social and personal services sector.

(2) From April to September 2025, the stamp duty collection from (i) lease, (ii) sale and purchase of properties and (iii) transfer of properties other than by way of sale and purchase and their comparison with the same period of last year is presented in the table below.




Stamp duty
Amount ($)
Comparison with the same period in 2024


Lease
350 million
-30%


Sale and purchase of properties
9.2 billion
+7%


Transfer of properties other than
			by way of sale and purchase
54 million
-13%




(3) According to the statistics of the C&SD, the financial services sector took up about 22 per cent and 25 per cent of GDP in 2022 and 2023 respectively. The statistics for 2024 are still being compiled.

 The stamp duty collection from stock transactions in 2024-25 was $52 billion, representing an increase of about 43 per cent compared to last year. The stamp duty collection from stock transactions in the first two quarters of 2025-26 was about $44 billion, representing an increase of about 143 per cent comparing to the same period of last year.

(4) Under the Hotel Accommodation Tax Ordinance (Cap. 348), the hotel accommodation tax (HAT) is levied quarterly and hotel and guesthouse proprietors are required to pay the HAT to the Government within 14 days after quarter-end. The HAT collected by the Government for the first and second quarters of 2025 amounted to about $190 million and $170 million respectively. The statistics for Q3 2025 are still being compiled.

(5) From January to September 2025, the business registration fee collected was about $2.6 billion, while the number of applications for exemption from payment of business registration fee and levy received was around 21 000 in the same period.

Notes:
Both median monthly employment earnings and median monthly household incomes are rounded to the nearest hundred.

(1) Monthly employment earnings refer to earnings (before deduction of Mandatory Provident Fund contributions) from all jobs during the month before enumeration. For employees, they include wage and salary, bonus, commission, tips, housing allowance, overtime allowance, attendance allowance and other cash allowances. However, back pays are excluded. For employers and self-employed, they refer to amounts drawn from the self-owned enterprise for personal and household use. If information on the amounts drawn for personal and household use is not available, data on net earnings from business would be collected instead.

(2) Employed persons refer to those persons aged 15 and over who have been engaged in performing work for pay or profit during the seven days before enumeration or who have had formal job attachment. Unpaid family workers and employed persons who were on leave/holiday during the seven days before enumeration are included.

(3) Monthly household income refers to the total cash income, including earnings (before deduction of Mandatory Provident Fund contributions) from all jobs and other cash income received in the month before enumeration by all members of the household. Other cash income includes income generated from rent income, interest, dividends, regular/monthly pensions and insurance annuity benefits, regular contribution from persons outside the household, regular contribution from charities and all government subsidies.

(4) Domestic household consists of persons who live together and make common provision for essentials for living. These persons need not be related. If a person makes provision for essentials for living without sharing with other persons, he/she is also regarded as a household. In this case, the household is a one-person household. A domestic household must have at least one member who is a Usual Resident. Households comprising Mobile Residents only are not classified as domestic households.

答覆：

主席：

為應對人力短缺帶來的挑戰，政府在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，適度容許僱主確實未能在本地聘得合適人手時申請輸入勞工，推動香港的經濟發展。除為建造業、運輸業，以及安老院和殘疾人士院舍推出行業輸入勞工計劃外，勞工處自二○二三年九月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），暫停執行原有「補充勞工計劃」下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位一般不得輸入勞工的規定，以補充維持經濟動力所必須的勞動力。

就議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）自推行以來截至二○二五年九月，優化計劃共接獲7 932宗來自餐飲服務業及223宗來自住宿服務業的申請，分別涉及申請輸入60 449名和2 982名勞工；其間獲批的餐飲服務業和住宿服務業申請分別為5 188宗和167宗，獲批輸入勞工人數分別為35 589名和2 102名。上述兩個行業的申請和獲批輸入勞工人數按工種劃分的分項數字載於附件1。

​同期，有10宗餐飲服務業的申請被拒絕，涉及44名輸入勞工，被拒絕申請涉及的輸入勞工人數按工種劃分的分項數字載於附件2。申請被拒絕的主要原因包括未能符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工的二比一人手比例（人手比例）規定或僱主有不良紀錄。同期沒有住宿服務業的申請被拒絕。

截至二○二五年八月，經「補充勞工計劃」／優化計劃仍在港工作的餐飲服務業和住宿服務業輸入勞工人數分別為16 622名及547名。勞工處沒有備存仍在港從事餐飲服務業和住宿服務業工作輸入勞工人數按工種劃分的分項數字。

（二）截至二○二五年九月，勞工處在僱主進行優化計劃下本地招聘期間，分別就餐飲服務業及住宿服務業作出1 257宗及441宗就業轉介，有107名及33名求職者獲僱主提出聘用。就業轉介按工種劃分的分項數字載於附件3。

（三）為保障本地工人的就業機會，獲批准輸入勞工的僱主必須與輸入勞工簽訂標準僱傭合約（標準合約），並支付不低於相類職位中位工資的薪金。輸入勞工只可擔任標準合約指定的職位及職務，並在指定的地點工作，不可轉換職位或職務範圍。勞工處已在優化計劃專題網頁新增網上投訴表格，方便本地僱員及輸入勞工就僱主涉嫌違反優化計劃的規定作出投訴。此外，勞工處的勞工督察不時巡查輸入勞工的工作地點，查核僱主有否遵守優化計劃的規定。僱主如違反有關規定，勞工處會對有關僱主作出行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准及拒絕處理其隨後兩年提交的輸入勞工申請。

（四）及（五）為加強保障本地工人優先就業，勞工處自二○二五年六月起實施新措施，包括進行特別巡查行動，到聘用輸入勞工的企業查核僱主有否持續符合人手比例的規定；及按違規風險要求僱主申報全職本地僱員及輸入勞工的資料和相關人手比例。勞工處在特別巡查行動中共進行324次巡查，當中大部分僱主符合人手比例的規定。勞工處現正就有初步資料顯示，僱主未能符合人手比例規定的個案作進一步調查。此外，勞工處已按違規風險要求超過150名餐飲服務業僱主申報全職本地僱員及輸入勞工的資料和相關人手比例，沒有發現違規個案。

（六）及（七）自優化計劃推行以來，勞工處於二○二三年（九月四日至十二月三十一日）、二○二四年及二○二五年（截至九月）分別接獲一宗、22宗及327宗涉及餐飲服務業僱主的投訴。此外，二○二三年九月四日至二○二四年十二月三十一日，勞工處沒有收到涉及住宿服務業的投訴；而二○二五年（截至九月）則收到三宗有關投訴。按主要投訴事項劃分的分項數字載於附件4。由於投訴人無須表明其身分，勞工處沒有備存按投訴人身分劃分的分項數字。

勞工處已就收到的投訴展開調查，包括到輸入勞工的工作地點進行巡查及搜證，獨立會見僱主及僱員並查核有關的僱傭紀錄。由於負責調查投訴的職員同時執行其他職務，涉及調查工作的人手未能分開計算。

上述涉及餐飲服務業及住宿服務業的投訴中，勞工處已完成調查所有於二○二三年和二○二四年接獲的個案。完成調查的61宗個案中，60宗沒有足夠證據確立僱主違反優化計劃的規定；其他投訴個案正在調查中。基於保密原則，勞工處不會透露個別投訴個案的資料。就一宗餐飲服務業的僱主以輸入勞工取代在職本地僱員的個案，勞工處於二○二五年八月二十九日公布，向該名僱主施加行政制裁，撤銷該僱主就優化計劃已獲發的輸入勞工原則性批准及拒絕處理其隨後兩年提交的輸入勞工申請。

此外，就上述投訴及針對個別僱主的違法行為，勞工處於二○二四‍年及二○二五年分別向一名及六名違反《僱員補償條例》、《入境條例》或優化計劃規定的餐飲服務業或住宿服務業僱主施加行政制裁，撤銷其已獲得的輸入勞工批准，或／及拒絕處理這些僱主在隨後提交的其他申請，禁制期長達兩年。違反法例的僱主被判罰款1,600元至24,000元。

（八）政府一直動態監察就業市場的情況，與持份者保持緊密溝通，並參考政府統計處定期發布各項有關本港僱員就業情況和收入概況的統計數據及相關統計分析，因應最新的勞動力市場情況靈活精準地調整優化計劃的實施安排，致力確保本地工人優先就業。

勞工及福利局剛展開人力推算的中期更新，會針對輸入勞工比例較高的行業優先進行數據分析，以期提早提供有關部分的分析結果，在檢討優化計劃時作參考及幫助政府做好中長期規劃。"

(2) as employers applying for importation of workers under the ESLS are required to undertake local public recruitment exercises and the Labour Department will identify local job-seekers for referrals to these employers for interviews, of the respective numbers of local job-seekers referred by the authorities in respect of the applications concerning the catering and hotel-related industries in each year since the implementation of the ESLS, and among them, the number of job-seekers who have successfully secured employment, and their respective percentages, with a breakdown by job category (e.g. ‍waiters/waitresses, junior cooks and cooks);

(3) as it is required under the ESLS that imported labour are only allowed to work in the positions and perform job duties as specified in a Standard Employment Contract, there are views relaying that some employers in the catering industry have failed to fulfil such requirement by hiring junior imported labour (e.g. junior cooks) at lower wages and requiring them to take up positions at higher levels (e.g. No. 1 Cooks) and perform advanced duties beyond their designated scope of duties, thus affecting employment opportunities for local workers, of the targeted measures put in place by the authorities to combat such non-compliant acts;

(4) as the authorities indicated in June this year that a special inspection campaign would be launched to verify whether employers under the ESLS were able to meet the manning ratio requirements of full-time local employees to imported labour of 2:1 on a continuous basis, of the respective numbers of inspections conducted for applications concerning the catering and hotel-related industries so far and the number of enterprises involved; whether cases have been found during inspections in which employers have failed to meet the relevant manning ratio requirements; if so, of the details (including the number of cases and names of employers);

(5) as the authorities indicated in June this year that it would require employers under the ESLS to report information on full-time local employees and imported labour as well as the relevant manning ratios based on a risk-based approach, of the respective numbers of employers in the catering and hotel-related industries who have been asked to report such information so far, and their percentages in the total numbers of employers in all those industries under the ESLS; whether it will consider requiring all employers of imported labour to report such information on a regular basis;

(6) of the respective numbers of complaints received by the Government from (i) local workers and (ii) imported labour in the catering and hotel-related industries about the alleged non-compliance with requirements under the ESLS and/or the labour legislation by employers in each year since implementation of the ESLS, with a breakdown by nature of complaints; of the manpower deployed by the authorities to investigate those cases;

(7) regarding the complaints mentioned in (6), of the number of cases in respect of which investigations have been completed, and among which, the number of cases confirmed or ruled by the court to be non-compliant with the requirements under the ESLS and/or the labour legislation, and the following information for each of such cases: (i) ‍dates of complaints, (ii) commencement and (iii) completion dates of investigation, (iv) names of employers and (v) the industries to which they belong, (vi) details of non-compliance and/or violations (e.g. the employers involved are confirmed to have dismissed local employees or reduced their working hours after hiring imported labour, and the number of local employees affected), (vii) details of the administrative sanctions imposed and/or prosecutions instituted by the authorities, and (viii) penalties imposed by the court (if ‍applicable); and

(8) as it has been reported that a significant number of the approved applications under the ESLS involve positions engaging in job categories concerning the catering and hotel-related industries (including waiters/waitresses, junior cooks, and cooks), whether the authorities will consider regularly collecting and compiling statistics on employment data (including unemployment rates and underemployment rates) for local workers engaged in those job categories, and gain an understanding of the changes in such data, so as to provide additional reference information when reviewing and adjusting the ESLS?

Reply:

President,

To cope with the challenges brought by manpower shortage and foster Hong Kong's economic development, the Government, on the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, suitably allows employers with genuine difficulty in recruiting suitable local workers to apply for importation of workers. Apart from launching sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction sector, transport sector, and residential care homes for the elderly and residential care homes for persons with disabilities, the Labour Department (LD) has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023 to suspend the general exclusion of the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts from labour importation under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme (SLS) to supplement the labour force required for sustaining the economic momentum.

The reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) Since its implementation and as at September 2025, the ESLS received a total of 7 932 applications from the food and beverage services industry and 223 applications from the accommodation services industry, involving 60 449 and 2 982 imported workers respectively. During the period, 5 188 and 167 applications from the food and beverage services industry, and the accommodation services industry were approved respectively. The numbers of imported workers approved were 35 589 and 2 102 respectively. A breakdown of the number of imported workers applied for and approved by job title for the two aforesaid industries is at Annex 1.

During the same period, 10 applications from the food and beverage services industry were rejected, involving 44 imported workers. A breakdown of the number of imported workers involved in the rejected applications by job title is at Annex 2. Applications were rejected mainly because employers had failed to meet the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers of 2:1 (manning ratio) or had adverse records. No application from the accommodation services industry was rejected during the same period.

As at August 2025, there were respectively 16 622 and 547 imported workers working in the food and beverage services industry, and the accommodation services industry in Hong Kong under the SLS/ESLS. The LD does not maintain a breakdown of the number of imported workers working in the food and beverage services industry, and the accommodation services industry in Hong Kong by job title.

(2) As at September 2025, the LD made 1 257 and 441 job referrals under the ESLS for the food and beverage services industry, and the accommodation services industry respectively during the local recruitment exercises conducted by employers.107 and 33 job seekers respectively received employment offers from the employers. A breakdown of the number of job referrals by job title is at Annex 3.

(3) To safeguard the employment opportunities of local workers, employers approved to import workers must sign a Standard Employment Contract (SEC) with imported workers and shall pay a salary not lower than the median monthly wage of a comparable position. Imported workers shall only work in the positions and carry out job duties as specified in SEC, and at the designated workplace(s). Change in positions or job duties is not allowed. The LD launched an online complaint form on the ESLS dedicated webpage to enable local employees and imported workers to lodge complaints against employers for suspected breaches of the requirements of the ESLS. In addition, Labour Inspectors of the LD conduct inspections of workplaces of imported workers from time to time to verify whether employers are complying with the ESLS requirements. If an employer has violated relevant requirements, the LD will impose administrative sanction on the employer, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of labour previously granted to the employer and refusal to process applications submitted in the following two years.

(4) and (5) To strengthen the protection of employment priority for local workers, the LD has implemented new measures since June 2025, including launching a special inspection campaign to check whether establishments employing imported workers had continuously met the manning ratio requirement, and requiring employers, based on a risk-based approach, to report information on full-time local employees and imported workers as well as the relevant manning ratio. The LD conducted 324 inspections during the special inspection campaign, and the majority of the concerned employers complied with the manning ratio requirement. The LD is conducting further investigation into cases where preliminary information indicates that employers have failed to comply with the manning ratio requirement. Besides, the LD requested more than 150 employers in the food and beverage services industry to report information on full-time local employees and imported workers as well as the relevant manning ratio based on a risk-based approach. No violation was detected.

(6) and (7) Since the implementation of the ESLS, the LD received one, 22 and 327 complaints against employers in the food and beverage services industry in 2023 (from September 4 to December 31), 2024 and 2025 (as at September) respectively. Besides, from September 4, 2023 to December 31, 2024, the LD did not receive any complaint involving the accommodation services industry, while three relevant complaints were received in 2025 (as at September). A breakdown by major complaint items is at Annex 4. As complainants need not disclose their identity, the LD does not maintain a breakdown of the number of complaints by the identity of complainants.

The LD has launched investigation into all complaints received, including conducting inspections and gathering evidence at workplaces of imported workers, meeting with employers and employees individually and verifying relevant employment records. As the staff responsible for investigating complaints also undertake other duties, the manpower involved in investigation work cannot be separately identified.

Of the above complaints involving the food and beverage services industry, and the accommodation services industry, the LD completed investigations of all complaints received in 2023 and 2024. Among the 61 cases of which investigations were completed, there was insufficient evidence to establish employers' violation of the ESLS requirements in 60 cases, while the other cases are still under investigation. For reason of confidentiality, the LD will not disclose information of individual complaints. For a case involving an employer in the food and beverage services industry who displaced local employees with imported workers, the LD announced on August 29, 2025 the imposition of administrative sanction on the employer, withdrawing the approvals-in-principle for importation of labour previously granted and refusing to process applications submitted by the employer in the following two years.

In addition, regarding the aforementioned complaints and legal non-compliances of individual employers, the LD respectively imposed administrative sanctions in 2024 and 2025 on one and six employers of the food and beverage services industry, and the accommodation services industry who had violated the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, the Immigration Ordinance or the requirements of the ESLS. The LD withdrew their approvals for importation of labour previously granted, and/or refused to process their subsequent applications with a debarment period up to two years. The employers who violated the law were fined between $1,600 and $24,000.

(8) The Government has been dynamically monitoring changes in the employment market, maintaining close liaison with the stakeholders, and making reference to various statistical data and relevant statistical analyses on employment and income of local employees regularly published by the Census and Statistics Department. In response to the latest labour market situation, the Government adopts a flexible and targeted approach to adjust the implementation arrangements of the ESLS with a view to ensuring employment priority for local workers.

The Labour and Welfare Bureau has just commenced the mid-term update of the Manpower Projection and will accord priority to data analysis for industries with a higher proportion of imported labour, with a view to providing the relevant part of analytical results in advance for reference in reviewing the ESLS and supporting the Government's medium- to long-term planning."

LCQ7: Prevention of employee overexertion at work,2025-10-22 11:24,2025-10-22 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200245.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Lam Chun-sing and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

 Regarding the prevention of employee overexertion at work, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as there are views pointing out that at present, the Government has not drawn up any definition for ""overexertion at work"", and when an employee is suspected to have died suddenly due to overexertion at work, such cases are often classified as ""fatalities at work not caused by accidents or occupational diseases"", of the number of such cases recorded by the Labour Department (LD) in each of the past 10 ‍years and this year to date, with a breakdown by the deceased's (a) sex, (b) age, (c) industry, (d) occupation, (e) average maximum working hours per month during any period of continuous employment (i.e. two or more consecutive months) in the six months prior to death (set out by (i) less than 256 hours, (ii) 256 to 279 hours, (iii) 280 to 299 hours, (iv) 300 to 319 hours, (v) 320 to 339 hours and (vi) 340 hours or more), (f) total working hours in the month prior to death (set out by (i) 276 hours or less, (ii) 277 to 299 hours, (iii) ‍300 ‍to 319 hours, (iv) 320 to 339 hours and (v) 340 hours or more), and (g) cause of death (e.g. heart disease and brain disease), together with their respective percentages;

(2) in respect of the cases mentioned in (1), of the number of those in which the authorities have provided assistance to or conducted follow-up actions for claims lodged by the families of deceased employees against the relevant employers; the up-to-date number of cases in which the handling has been completed, with a breakdown by claim status (including deceased employees' families who have (i) withdrawn their claims for compensation, (ii) reached settlement agreements with the employers, and (iii) filed their claims in court against the employers), together with their respective percentages; the average amount of compensation involved in these claims and the respective numbers of successful and unsuccessful claims; the average amount of compensation awarded in successful cases;

(3) given that in its reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on November 30, 2016, the Government indicated that under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance (Cap. 509), employers must, so far as reasonably practicable, ensure the safety and health at work of their employees, which includes ensuring that their employees are given appropriate rest breaks, of the criteria on which the authorities base their determination as to whether an employee has been given appropriate rest breaks; whether any of the employers involved in the cases mentioned in (1) have been found to have contravened the relevant requirements under Cap. 509; if so, of the details, including the number of cases in which prosecutions were instituted and the number of convicted cases, and the average penalties imposed in convicted cases;

(4) given that some studies have shown a high incidence of fatalities during work relating to cerebro-cardiovascular diseases among security guards and construction workers, the Labour Department and the Occupational Safety and Health Council launched a three-year Heart Caring Campaign in June 2022 to provide on-site health risk assessments and related services to employees in the construction and property management industries, so as to enable frontline workers in these industries to identify risks associated with cerebro-cardiovascular diseases at an early stage, of the numbers of participating organisations and beneficiary workers under the Campaign, with a breakdown by industry (i.e. construction and property management industries);

(5) given that in 2018, the Government decided to draw up sector-specific working hours guidelines for 11 sectors through the industry-based tripartite committees of the LD, setting out suggested working hours arrangements and overtime compensation arrangements for employers' reference and adoption, of the latest progress in the development of these guidelines; and

(6) whether it will consider, with reference to the practices of neighbouring regions, drawing up a definition for overexertion at work and requiring employers to fulfil relevant statutory compensation obligations where an employee is injured or dies under circumstances falling within such definition, so as to provide greater protection for workers or their family members; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The reply to the Hon Lam Chun-sing's question is as follows:

(1) Over the past 10 years, the number of cases of fatalities at work received by the Labour Department (LD) each year that were not caused by work accidents or occupational diseases ranged from 98 to 182. According to the LD's statistics on occupational fatalities, cases died of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CCVDs) during work accounted for the vast majority of fatalities at work which are not caused by accidents. A breakdown of these cases by sex, age, industry, occupation or work nature, and cause of death, together with their respective percentages is provided in Annex I. The LD does not keep statistics of such cases by the total working hours of the cases in the month prior to their death, or the average maximum monthly working hours for two or more consecutive months prior to their death.

(2) As at September 2025, the LD had concluded the processing of 1397 cases of the 1439 cases mentioned in Part (1) and was following up on the remaining 42 cases. The average claim amount of each concluded case was around $890,000. Among the concluded cases, five received compensation from employers after LD's processing, and 1374 cases were not pursued by family members (FMs) or FMs had reached direct settlements with the employers, etc. FMs of the remaining 18 cases had lodged their claims at court. Among these 18 cases, the LD noted that 17 cases had been concluded, all with settlements reached at court.

(3) According to the general duty provisions under section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance (OSHO), every employer must, so far as reasonably practicable, ensure the safety and health at work of all his/her employees. This includes providing or maintaining systems of work that are safe and without risks to health, and rest breaks are essential for restoring employees' mental and physical strength. When conducting inspections at various workplaces in accordance with the OSHO, LD officers will assess whether the employer has provided or maintained a system of work which is safe and without risks to health by considering the environment of the individual workplace, the nature of the work, and the employees' personal factors, etc, rather than just considering rest arrangement alone. If deficiencies are found during the inspections, corresponding enforcement actions will be taken according to the law, depending on the seriousness of the case and the evidence collected. The LD does not keep prosecution figures related to rest arrangements.

 In addition, the LD has issued the Guide on Rest Breaks to encourage stakeholders of different industries, through a risk-based and consultative approach and having regard to their own circumstances, to work out reasonable and practicable rest break arrangements that are mutually agreed by employees and employers.

(4) Since 2022, the LD and the Occupational Safety and Health Council have jointly launched the Heart Caring Campaign to encourage employees in the property management and construction industries to develop healthy lifestyle to prevent CCVDs. As at September 30, 2025, 1 991 organisations (including 522 organisations in the construction industry and 1 469 organisations in the property management industry) have participated in the Campaign and signed the Heart Caring Charter, covering more than 340 000 employees, including nearly 100 000 employees in the construction industry and more than 240 000 employees in the property management industry.

(5) The LD has endeavoured to discuss with employer associations, labour organisations, etc, the formulation of sector-specific working hours guidelines through industry-based tripartite committees. While the participants candidly shared working hours arrangements and related measures in various sectors, the employers and employees have yet to reach a consensus on the direction and content of the proposed guidelines, including whether and how to establish weekly or daily working hours standards as well as the rates of compensation for overtime work. The LD will make reference to the discussions of tripartite committees to enhance the publicity and promotion of good working hours management practices, encourage employers and employees to formulate appropriate working hours arrangements thereby fostering employees' work-life balance. The tripartite committees will continue deliberating on issues relevant working hours.

(6) ""Overexertion at work"" is not a medical diagnosis. According to the information available to the LD, the International Labour Organization has not drawn up any definition or guidelines on workplace deaths caused by ""overexertion at work"", and there is also lack of internationally recognised criteria. Most countries or places do not have related definitions made in the context of employees' compensation.

 The existing Employees' Compensation Ordinance (ECO) of Hong Kong has stipulated that even if the disease suffered by an employee is not a specified occupational disease, the employee or his/her FMs may still claim compensation from the employer in respect of the disease in accordance with the ECO if the disease is substantiated to be a personal injury or death by accident arising out of and in the course of employment."
立法會七題：防止僱員工作過勞,2025-10-22 11:24,2025-10-22 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200243.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上林振昇議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

關於防止僱員工作過勞，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有意見指出，目前政府沒有就「工作過勞」制訂定義，若有僱員懷疑因工作過勞而猝死，往往被歸類為「在工作期間非因意外或職業病死亡」情況，過去十年每年及本年至今，勞工處錄得該情況的個案數目為何，並按死者（a）性別、（b）年齡、（c）所屬行業、（d）職業、（e）去世前六個月獲連續受聘期間（即連續兩個月或以上）的平均每月最高工時（以（i）256小時以下、（ii）256至279小時、（iii）280至299小時、（iv）300至319小時、（v）320至339小時及（vi）340小時或以上劃分）、（f）去世前一個月的總工時（以（i）276小時或以下、（ii）277至299小時、（iii）300至319小時、（iv）320至339小時及（v）340小時或上劃分），以及（g）死因（例如心臟疾病和腦疾病）列出分項數字及其所佔百分比；

（二）就第（一）項所述的個案，當局曾協助或跟進多少宗已故僱員家屬向有關僱主提出的申索個案；至今已完成處理的個案數目為何，並按申索情況（包括已故僱員家屬（i）放棄追討、（ii）已與僱主達成和解協議及（iii）已入稟法院向僱主提出申索）列出分項數字及有關百分比；該等申索涉及的平均款額，以及獲判勝訴及敗訴的宗數分別為何；獲判勝訴個案裁定的平均補償款額為何；

（三）鑑於政府於二○一六年十一月三十日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，根據《職業安全及健康條例》（第509章），僱主必須在合理及可行範圍內，確保僱員的工作安全及健康，包括確保其僱員得到適當的休息，當局根據甚麼準則判斷僱員是否得到適當休息；有否發現第（一）項所述個案涉及的僱主違反第509章的相關規定；如有，詳情為何，包括提出檢控及被定罪個案數目，以及被定罪個案的平均判罰；

（四）鑑於有研究顯示，保安員和建造業員工在工作期間因心腦血管病死亡的個案甚多，勞工處與職業安全健康局遂於二○二二年開展為期三年的「護心計劃」，為建造業和物業管理業機構的員工提供到會式健康風險評估等服務，讓該等行業前線員工及早認識心腦血管病的相關風險，該計劃的參與機構及受惠工友數目為何，並按行業（即建造業和物業管理業）列出分項數字；

（五）鑑於政府於二○一八年時決定會透過勞工處的行業性三方小組為11個行業編製行業性工時指引，以列明建議的工時安排及超時工作補償安排供僱主參考及採用，有關制訂指引工作的最新進展為何；及

（六）會否考慮參考鄰近地區的做法，為工作過勞制訂定義，並規定若有僱員在符合該定義的情況下受傷或死亡，其僱主須履行相關法定補償責任，以為工友或其家屬提供更大保障；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就林振昇議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）在過去十年，勞工處每年接獲涉及僱員在工作期間非因意外或職業病死亡的個案介乎98宗至182宗。根據勞工處有關職業傷亡致命個案的統計資料，於工作期間因心臟及腦血管疾病（心腦血管病）病發而死亡的個案，佔工作間非因意外死亡個案的絕大多數。有關個案按性別、年齡、所屬行業、職業／工作性質及死因劃分的分項數字及其所佔百分比詳列於附件一。勞工處沒有備存有關個案去世前一個月的總工時或去世前連續兩個月或以上內平均每月最高工時。

（二）就第（一）項所述的1 439宗個案，截至二○二五年九月，勞工處已完成處理1 397宗個案，正跟進餘下的42宗個案。已完成處理的個案每宗平均申索款額約為$890,000，其中經勞工處處理後獲僱主賠償的個案有五宗，家屬沒有繼續追討或家屬與僱主直接達成和解協議等的個案有1 374宗，其餘18宗個案的家屬已入稟法院向僱主提出申索。就家屬已入稟法院提出申索的個案，勞工處得悉法院已審結17宗，皆為在法院達成和解協議。

（三）根據《職業安全及健康條例》（《條例》）第6條的一般責任條款，僱主須在合理地切實可行範圍內，確保其僱員在工作中的安全及健康，包括為他們提供或維持屬安全和不會危害健康的工作系統，而休息時段是讓僱員恢復精神及體力的重要一環。勞工處人員根據《條例》巡查不同的工作地點時，會考慮個別工作地點的環境、工作性質及僱員的個人因素等情況，評估僱主有否提供或維持屬安全和不會危害健康的工作系統，而非只單獨考慮休息安排。若巡查發現有不足之處，視乎情況的嚴重性和所得證據，會按法例作出相應的執法行動。勞工處沒有備存與休息安排相關的檢控數字。

另外，勞工處已發出《休息時段指引》，鼓勵不同行業的持份者因應其行業情況，以風險為本及共同協商的原則，制定合理可行及勞資雙方同意的休息時段和安排。

（四）勞工處自二○二二年起聯同職業安全健康局推行「護心計劃」，鼓勵物業管理業和建造業的僱員建立健康生活習慣，預防心腦血管疾病。截至二○二五年九月三十日，共有1 991機構（包括522建造業機構及1 469物業管理機構）參加「護心計劃」並簽署「護心約章」，涵蓋僱員人數超過34萬，當中包括近10萬建造業僱員及超過24萬物業管理業僱員。

（五）勞工處致力在各行業性三方小組與僱主組織及勞工團體等商議擬定行業性工時指引。與會者坦誠分享各行業的工時安排及相關措施，但就擬定工時指引的方向及內容，包括應否及如何擬定每周或每天的標準工時，以及超時工作的工資補償比率等，勞資雙方仍未能達成共識。勞工處會參考三方小組的討論，加強宣傳及推廣良好工時管理措施，鼓勵僱主與僱員擬定合適的工時安排，促進僱員的工作與生活平衡。三方小組亦會繼續討論與工時有關的議題。

（六）「工作過勞」並非一個醫學診斷。根據勞工處所掌握的資料，國際勞工組織並沒有就「工作過勞」而導致工作間死亡制訂定義或指引，國際上亦缺乏公認的準則；而絕大部分國家或地方並沒有循僱員補償角度制訂相關定義。

香港現行的《僱員補償條例》已訂明，即使僱員所患疾病並非指明的職業病，但經證明是僱員在受僱工作期間因工遭遇意外所致的身體受傷或死亡，僱員或其家屬仍可根據條例就有關疾病向僱主追討補償。"
LCQ13: Enhancing boundary-crossing experience for travellers,2025-10-22 11:00,2025-10-22 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200255.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hak-kan and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (Oct 22):

Question:

  It is learnt that the Mainland and Hong Kong have all along endeavoured to enhance the boundary-crossing experience for travellers. However, some members of the public have relayed that, due to the high volume of passengers crossing the border, quite a number of travellers still have to queue up to go through immigration clearance at some land boundary control points (BCPs) just before they close. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as some members of the public have relayed that the Lok Ma Chau Control Point, which is open 24 hours a day, often experiences heavy passenger flow after most land BCPs close late at night, whether the authorities have considered extending the operating hours of other land BCPs; if so, of the detailed plan for adjusting the operating hours of various land BCPs; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether there is currently any mechanism in place at various land BCPs for exercising discretion to extend the operating hours in order to cope with situations where a large number of travellers are waiting to cross the border before the BCPs close; if so, how many times has the relevant mechanism been activated in the past three years; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will discuss with the Mainland the relevant mechanism to address the situation;

(3) whether a notification mechanism had been formulated with the Mainland authorities to mutually notify each other of the number of travellers going through departure clearance at certain time periods (e.g. every half an hour) before the BCPs close to ensure that there is sufficient time for travellers for immigration clearance; if so, how many times has the relevant mechanism been activated in the past three years; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will discuss setting up of such a mechanism with the Mainland;

(4) in the past three years, of (i) the number of cases in which inbound travellers arriving in Hong Kong via land BCPs in the Mainland had to seek assistance from the Immigration Department because the BCPs in Hong Kong were closed, and (ii) the number of cases in which outbound travellers via various land BCPs in Hong Kong had to turn back immediately because the BCPs in the Mainland were closed; and

(5) in the past three years, of the respective numbers of outbound and inbound passengers at various land BCPs in Hong Kong during the hour before their closure, as well as the average waiting time for immigration clearance (including the use of the automated clearance system (e-Channel) service); whether there is any significant difference in the average waiting time for immigration clearance between the aforementioned period and other periods; if so, whether it will, on the basis of the relevant data, consider discussing or studying with the Mainland authorities the extension of the clearance time?

Reply:

President,

  With the increasing cross-boundary passenger flows between Guangdong and Hong Kong, exchanges at the community level have also intensified. In view of the growing demand for clearance services, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been closely monitoring the operation of the boundary control points (BCPs) and proactively enhancing the clearance capacity to facilitate the two-way flow of people between Hong Kong and the Mainland.

  The reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Hak-kan is as follows:

(1) The opening hours of land BCPs are determined through consultation between the HKSAR Government and the Shenzhen Municipal Government, and are subject to the approval of the Central Authorities.

  At present, Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang (LMC/HG) Port is the only BCP between Shenzhen and Hong Kong providing round-the-clock passenger clearance services. According to the statistics of the Immigration Department (ImmD), the current service capacity of LMC/HG Port is able to meet the demand for cross-boundary travels during late-night hours, fulfilling the ImmD's performance pledge to clear 98 per cent of Hong Kong residents within a 15-minute waiting time and 95 per cent of visitors within a 30-minute waiting time.

  The governments of both sides would also make special arrangements to meet the demand for clearance services and facilitate cross-boundary passenger flows during festive periods. For instance, on New Year's Eve last year, the passenger clearance services at the Lo Wu Control Point, which usually close at midnight, were extended until 2am the following day, while the passenger and passenger vehicle clearance services at the Shenzhen Bay Control Point, which usually close at midnight, operated overnight.

  In addition, to cope with the increase in crossâboundary passenger flows during festive periods or largeâscale events, the departments at BCPs will pre-assess the cross-boundary passenger traffic and make corresponding arrangements, including arranging officers of other sections to work at BCPs during peak hours to enhance services. The Transport Department will also co-ordinate in advance with the MTR Corporation Limited, as well as local and cross-boundary public transport operators, to increase service frequency based on the estimated passenger traffic. Besides, the departments at BCPs have been maintaining close liaison with relevant Mainland authorities through the established port hotlines and real-time notification mechanisms for various land BCPs to take timely actions where necessary, including flexibly deploying manpower to operate additional clearance counters, channels and private car kiosks, and converting some of the goods vehicle kiosks into private car kiosks having regard to actual needs, to ensure smooth operations of BCPs.

  The extension of operating hours of clearance services involves the operation of the ports on both the Mainland and Hong Kong sides, and careful consideration has to be given to a host of factors, including the actual needs, effective utilisation of resources of both places, manpower arrangements and ancillary transport services. On the basis of the 24-hour passenger clearance services currently provided at the LMC/HG Port and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port, we will continue to closely monitor the demand for passenger clearance services and, having regard to actual needs, liaise with relevant Mainland authorities on extending the operating hours of the passenger clearance services at respective BCPs when necessary.

(2) to (4) Relevant departments of Hong Kong and the Mainland at BCPs would maintain close liaison through the established real-time notification mechanisms to monitor the real-time situations at land BCPs and ensure smooth clearance and crowd management.

  As aforementioned, the opening hours of land BCPs are subject to the approval of the Central Authorities. In cases where BCPs of both places are nearing closing time and there are still a large number of passengers queuing up for clearance, relevant departments of both places will liaise closely and immediately exchange information, including the number of passengers who have completed departure clearance at BCPs. The ImmD would exercise flexibility and operate extra clearance counters and channels when necessary, with a view to ensuring the completion of arrival clearance for all inbound passengers who have completed departure clearance at the Mainland ports before the closure of BCPs. There will hence not be any instances where passengers, having completed departure clearance at the Mainland ports, are unable to complete arrival clearance due to the closure of BCPs in Hong Kong. We understand that the Mainland port authorities adopt a similar arrangement.

(5) Generally speaking, evening hours are not peak periods for boundary crossings at BCPs. However, it is observed that quite some passengers choose to cross the boundary shortly before the closing time of BCPs. As aforementioned, the departments at BCPs will flexibly deploy manpower and operate extra clearance counters and channels to ensure the completion of arrival clearance for all passengers who have completed departure clearance at the Mainland ports before the closure of BCPs.

  In the past three years, all land BCPs under the ImmD have met the ImmD's target to clear 98 per cent of Hong Kong residents within a 15-minute waiting time and 95 per cent of visitors within a 30-minute waiting time.

  The departments at BCPs will continue to take various measures, including flexible deployment of manpower, optimisation of workflow and effective use of information technology, so as to enhance the clearance efficiency and the level of clearance facilitation at BCPs to cope with the increasing demand for clearance services."

問題：

據悉內地與香港一直致力提升旅客的通關體驗。然而，有市民反映，由於跨境人流眾多，部分陸路口岸在臨近關閉時仍有不少旅客排隊等候辦理過關手續。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有市民反映，在深宵時分大部分陸路口岸關閉後，24小時開放的落馬洲管制站經常出現大量旅客人流，當局有否考慮延長其他陸路口岸的運作時間；若有，調整各口岸運作時間的詳細計劃為何；若否，原因為何；

（二）現時各陸路口岸有否設立酌情延長通關時間機制，以應對口岸關閉前仍有大量旅客等候過關的情況；若有，過去三年啓動相關機制的次數為何；若否，原因為何，以及會否與內地商討相關應對機制；

（三）有否與內地部門制訂通報機制，以在口岸關閉前的一段時間（例如半小時），互相通報正辦理離境手續的旅客人數，以確保有足夠時間為該等旅客辦理入境手續；若有，過去三年啓動相關機制的次數為何；若否，原因為何，以及會否與內地商討設立有關機制；

（四）過去三年，（i）經內地陸路口岸離境抵港的旅客，因本港關口已關閉而須向入境事務處求助的個案數目，以及（ii）經本港各陸路管制站離境的旅客，因內地關口已關閉而須即時折返回港的個案數目分別為何；及

（五）過去三年，本港各陸路管制站在關閉前一小時的平均出入境人次，以及辦理出入境手續（包括使用自助出入境檢查系統（e-道）服務）的平均等候時間分別為何；上述時段的通關平均等候時間與其他時段有否出現顯著差距；若有，會否考慮根據有關數據與內地當局商討或研究延長通關時間？

答覆：

主席：

隨着粵港市民跨境往來越趨頻繁，民間交流亦越見緊密。面對持續增長的通關需求，香港特別行政區政府一直密切監察各邊境管制站的運作，並積極提升口岸通關能力，便利香港與內地居民雙向奔赴。

就陳克勤議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）陸路口岸的開放時間由深港兩地政府協商，並須獲得中央批准。

目前，落馬洲／皇崗口岸為深港之間唯一24小時提供旅檢服務的口岸。根據入境事務處（入境處）的數據，現時落馬洲／皇崗口岸的服務能夠應付旅客於深夜時段過關的需求，並達致入境處的服務承諾，即98%的香港居民能夠在15分鐘內辦妥出入境手續，及95%的訪客能夠在30分鐘內辦妥出入境手續。

兩地政府亦會因應節日的通關需求，協商特別通關安排，便利兩地人民往來。例如，於去年除夕夜把羅湖口岸的旅客清關服務由原來凌晨十二時關閉延長至翌日凌晨二時，以及把深圳灣口岸的旅客和客車清關服務由原來凌晨十二時關閉，改為通宵服務。

此外，因應節日或大型活動期間增加的跨境人流，口岸部門會預先評估跨境旅客流量並作出相應安排，包括於繁忙時間安排其他組別的人員到管制站工作以加強服務。運輸署會提前與港鐵、本地和跨境公共交通營辦商協調，按預測人流加密班次。口岸部門亦會與內地相關部門，透過已建立的各個陸路口岸熱線及即時通報機制緊密聯繫，於有需要時作出迅速應變，靈活調配管制站人手加開檢查櫃枱、通道及小車車道，並按實際需要將部分貨車車道用作小車車道，確保口岸運作暢順。

延長通關時間牽涉兩地口岸運作，須審慎考慮一籃子因素，包括實際需要、兩地資源的有效運用、人手安排及交通配套等。在現行落馬洲／皇崗口岸及港珠澳大橋香港口岸提供24小時旅客出入境清關服務基礎上，我們會繼續密切留意旅客通關需求，視乎實際需要適時與內地有關當局協商延長個別口岸的旅檢通關服務時間。

（二）至（四）深港兩地口岸部門就各個陸路口岸均已設立了即時通報機制，緊密聯絡，時刻監察陸路口岸的情況，確保通關及人流管理等工作暢順。

如上文所述，陸路口岸的開放時間須獲得中央批准。於兩地陸路管制站接近關閉時間，如仍有大量旅客排隊等候過關，兩地口岸部門會緊密對接，即時交換資訊，包括在管制站已完成辦理離境手續的旅客人數。入境處會彈性處理，在有需要時加開檢查櫃枱及通道，確保在管制站關閉前，為所有已在內地口岸完成辦理離境手續的旅客辦理入境手續，因而不會出現旅客在內地口岸完成離境手續後，因港方口岸已經關閉而未能辦理入境手續的情況。據我們了解，內地口岸部門的處理方式亦類同。

（五）一般而言，晚間時段並非陸路管制站的出入境高峰時段。然而，我們亦留意到，有不少旅客選擇在部分陸路管制站接近關閉前過關。如上文所述，口岸部門會靈活調配人手，加開檢查櫃枱及通道，確保在管制站關閉前，為所有已在內地口岸完成辦理離境手續的旅客辦理入境手續。

過去三年，入境處陸路邊境管制站皆達到入境處所定目標，即98%的香港居民能夠在15分鐘內辦妥出入境手續，及95%的訪客能夠在30分鐘內辦妥出入境手續。

口岸部門會繼續採取各項措施，包括靈活調配人手、優化工作流程、善用資訊科技等，提升口岸通關效率和便利化水平，應對不斷上升的通關需求。"

CHP urges schoolchildren to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as severe paediatric influenza infection case was recorded over two consecutive days,2025-10-21 21:14,2025-10-21 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100859.htm,"Following yesterday's (October 20) announcement ofa case of severe paediatric influenza A infection, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 21) recorded another severe case.The CHP reiterated its appeal to schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves a 2-year-old girl with underlyingillness. She has developed a fever, cough and shortness of breathsince October 10. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospitalon October 16 and was admitted for treatment. She is currently in critical condition. Her nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for the influenza A(H1)virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with severe pneumonia.

The girl had not received the 2025/26 SIV yet. Her household contacts are currently asymptomatic and no influenza outbreaks have been reported at her school recently.

  ""Hong Kong is currently in the summer influenza season and there has been a significant increase in influenza-like illnessoutbreaks in schools since September. As of October 21, 587 outbreaks have been reported in schools since the start of the school year in September, including 62 cases in kindergartens/child care centres, 315 cases in primary schools and 210 cases in secondary schools. Including the above case, 12 severe paediatric influenza cases, including one fatal case, involving children aged 2 to 17 have been recorded since the start of the school year. Nine of them had good past health,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

  ""Members of the public, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if presented with fever and respiratory symptoms, for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to the Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions,"" he added.

The 2025/26 SIV Programmes have commenced, offering free or subsidised SIV to eligible high-risk groups through various vaccination programmes. This year, all schools may choose to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV nasal vaccines) and ""hybrid mode"", i.e. schools are allowed to choose both injectable inactivated influenza vaccines and LAIV for the same or different outreach vaccination activities.

The Government has opened all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged 6 months to under 2 years. Moreover, the District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission in the 18 districts, and 74 Family Medicine Clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For a list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP'sVaccination Schemespage. Parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccinations at designated MCHCs via theonline booking system.

Dr Tsui reminded high-risk individuals to wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

For the latest information on seasonal influenza, members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."

連續兩日錄得兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲學童盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-10-21 20:30,2025-10-21 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100828.htm,"繼昨日（十月二十日）公布一宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月二十一日）再接獲另一宗嚴重個案。中心再次呼籲學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的兩歲女童。她十月十日開始出現發燒、咳嗽和氣促，十月十六日到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫，需留院治理，目前情況危殆。她的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感（H1）呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發嚴重肺炎。

女童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗。她的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵，她就讀的學校近日亦沒有出現流感爆發的情況。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港正值夏季流感季節，學校的流感樣疾病爆發個案自九月起大幅上升。截至十月二十一日，九月開學後涉及學校的爆發個案共有587宗，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（62宗）、小學（315宗）及中學（210宗）。計及上述個案，中心由開學至今錄得十二宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，當中包括一宗死亡個案，年齡介乎2至17歲，其中九人過往的健康狀況良好。」

他續說：「市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。」

二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃已經展開，為合資格的高風險群組透過各項疫苗注射計劃免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗。今年所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗以及「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。

此外，政府亦已開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有6個月至2歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下18區的地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的74間家庭醫學診所和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱衞生防護中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。

徐樂堅醫生提醒高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

Deputy Director Luo Yonggang (Deputy Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Acting CommissionerLi Yongsheng (Acting Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Dr Raymond Chan (Chair of the Shaw Prize Foundation), Professor Kenneth Young (Chair of the Shaw Prize Council), Professor Reinhard Genzel (Chair of the Board of Adjudicators of the Shaw Prize Foundation), esteemed laureates, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. I am delighted to be here, with you, on this splendid occasion – the Shaw Prize Award Presentation Ceremony. A celebration of the achievements by our remarkable scientists.

  Generations after generations, we stand on the shoulders of giants to gaze upon the future of science, consolidating, building on, and often breaking through the foundations built by them.

  As we gather to celebrate new achievements on this journey, we must also pay tribute to trailblazers who came before us. It is in this spirit of reverence, and continuity, that we remember and honour a monumental figure for the Shaw Prize, the scientific community and, indeed, humanity – Professor Chen-ning Yang.

  A founding member of the Shaw Prize Council and the Chair of its Board of Adjudicators for over a decade, Professor Yang was instrumental in establishing the very standards of excellence we recognise today. As one of the first Chinese scientists to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics, he reshaped modern physics, and remained devoted to the scientific and educational developments of China, our country.

  Professor Yang's spirit of intellectual pursuit, and his unwavering dedication to advancing knowledge for humanity, continue to live on today.

  This commitment to excellence brings us here tonight – some 600 strong from around the world – to honour this year's Shaw Laureates. Here to pay tribute to their pioneering advances in three discrete disciplines: astronomy, life science and medicine, and mathematical sciences.

  My congratulations to each of you for your outstanding, and continuing, contributions to science and to civilisation – to a future bright with co-operation, progress and purpose.

  That, of course, speaks of the vision Sir Run Run Shaw brought to compelling life – with the help of Professor Yang and other founding members – one that celebrates education and the pursuit of knowledge through science and research.

  That vision is central to the priorities and policies of the HKSAR Government. We dedicate significant investments to innovation and technology, and the research and development that drives it.

  That same commitment shapes our post-secondary education. I'm proud to say that Hong Kong is home to five of the world's top 100 universities. And, in the 2026 World University Rankings, announced earlier this month, Hong Kong claimed a record six spots in the top 200.

  Indeed, this year, for the first time, all eight of our publicly funded universities made the World University Rankings.

  And in this year's World Talent Ranking, Hong Kong finished fourth overall, topping the world in the category of ""graduates in sciences"".

  Hong Kong's outstanding institutions nurture our talented and hard-working young generation. They also help to attract some of the world's best academics and professionals to our city. Just this month, we welcomed a Nobel Laureate in Physics to one of our universities. We are thankful to many science laureates, as well as world-class academics and researchers in our city, and I'm confident that they will continue to propel Hong Kong's rise as an international education and I&T hub.

  The Hong Kong Government will continue to work closely with the Shaw Prize, our homegrown scientific award of international repute, in realising the potential of science, and in contributing to a world that prizes collaboration, harmony and a future of promise and innovation for all.

  My congratulations to all laureates again. I wish you a memorable evening in Hong Kong – Asia's world city. Asia's science city.

  Thank you."

Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency leads industry delegation to shine at 19th Hangzhou Cultural & Creative Industry Expo (with photos),2025-10-21 19:50,2025-10-21 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100539.htm,"The Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency (CCIDA) under the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau led industry members to participate in the 19th Hangzhou Cultural & Creative Industry Expo (HCIE) which started October 17 and concluded yesterday (October 20). A Hong Kong Pavilion themed ""Hong Kong is So Chic"" was set up, which showcased an array of exquisite design works and creative lifestyle representations. Through hosting a series of activities, it also enhanced the industry's exposure on the Chinese Mainland, fostering opportunities for market expansion and collaboration. The Hong Kong Pavilion was well received by visitors, with over 50 000 attendees recorded during the four-day expo period, reflecting the appeal of Hong Kong's cultural and creative forces.

  The design of the Hong Kong Pavilion focused on Hong Kong's vibrant cityscape, charaterised by the organised chaos from the city's narrow lanes and alleys, imparting an ambience of serenity. It showcased works from renowned Hong Kong brands and creators alongside creations from emerging designers and brands. Their designs represented the East-meets-West cultural fusion of Hong Kong, highlighting the diversity and unique charm of the city's cultural contours.

The Hong Kong Pavilion comprised the Art Toy Zone, the Fashion and Apparel Zone, the Hong Kong Brands Zone, and the Film and Comics Zone, exhibiting films, comics, art toys, fashion, jewellery, and lifestyle products from 13 local designers and brands, with an aim of showcasing the latest achievements in Hong Kong's cultural and creative industries. The Hong Kong Pavilion also hosted a variety of engaging activities during the expo, including music and dance performances, demonstrations of filigree craft and Hong Kong-style tea pulling, sharing and autograph sessions, all showcasing the soft power of Hong Kong's pop culture.

Following the enthusiastic response received by the Hong Kong Pavilion at the 21st China (Shenzhen) International Cultural Industries Fair in May this year, the HCIE once again provided a platform for Hong Kong's cultural and creative power to shine. As pledged in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"", CCIDA proactively assists Hong Kong cultural and creative designers in producing more cultural and creative products with Chinese and Hong Kong cultural features, and will continue to strengthen support for local original works to enter the Mainland and international markets."
反非法勞工行動拘十人（附圖）,2025-10-21 19:01,2025-10-21 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100745.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十月二十日至今日（十月二十一日）一連兩日在東涌區一個新入伙的大型屋苑展開代號為「促進行動」的反非法勞工行動，以打擊從事裝修工作的非法勞工。

入境處調查人員較早前留意到有內地裝修公司透過網上社交平台，以相對便宜的價錢作招倈，提供一站式的裝修工程服務。同時，有不法分子會聘請非法勞工來港進行裝修工作，以減低服務成本，從中獲利。

入境處隨即針對新入伙的大型屋苑展開行動，一共搜查超過一百五十個目標住宅及處所，拘捕七名懷疑非法勞工及三名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為七名男子，年齡介乎三十六至五十四歲。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主則為兩男一女，年齡介乎四十三至五十四歲。有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

同時，入境處職員亦安排宣傳車及派員於屋苑內向住戶及物業管理人員派發「切勿聘用非法員工」的宣傳單張，呼籲切勿聘用非法勞工。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他／她有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆者同罪。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

市民可使用舉報非法勞工專線3861 5000、傳真2824 1166、電郵anti_crime@immd.gov.hk、或登入入境處網址www.immd.gov.hk利用「網上舉報違反入境條例罪行」表格向入境處舉報僱用非法勞工活動。"
10 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operation (with photos) ,2025-10-21 19:01,2025-10-21 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100747.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted an anti-illegal worker operation at a newly built/inhabited housing estate at Tung Chung District codenamed ""Contribute"" for two consecutive days on October 20 and today (October 21) to combat the influx of illegal renovation workers.

  ImmD investigators recently noticed that some Mainland renovation companies were using online social media platforms to offer one-stop renovation services at a lower price. Meanwhile, some offenders might attempt to reduce their service costs and gain profit from hiring illegal workers to conduct renovation works in Hong Kong.

  ImmD immediately conducted an operation at a newly built/inhabited housing estate. Immigration officers raided over 150 target locations. A total of seven suspected illegal workers and three suspected employers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised seven men, aged 36 to 54. Two men and a woman, aged 43 to 54, suspected of employing the illegal workers, were also arrested. Investigations into the suspected employers are ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  At the same time, ImmD officers and a promotional vehicle have been deployed to distribute ""Don't Employ Illegal Workers"" leaflets and convey the message to occupants and property management staff in housing estates.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email toanti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form atwww.immd.gov.hk."

This year's meeting focused on key issues including global and regional economic situations and outlooks, digital finance, and fiscal policies of member economies.

Mr Chan spoke at various sessions of the meeting. During the session on the global and regional economic outlooks, he remarked that global growth momentum has weakened amid rising challenges from unilateralism and tariffs. He stressed that the global economy is facing heightened uncertainty, with some economies having to choose between co-operation and coercion, as well as between shared prosperity and narrow self-interest. Against this backdrop, Hong Kong, China remains firmly committed to upholding a free and open trade and investment environment, providing global enterprises and investors with a stable, consistent and predictable business environment. He called on all member economies to safeguard a rules-based multilateral trading system and to work together in promoting sustainable regional economic growth.

At the session on digital finance, Mr Chan highlighted that blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly advancing digital financial services. These technologies not only improve efficiency and reduce costs, but also play a key role in driving financial inclusion. Drawing on Hong Kong, China's experience, he shared three key observations on developing a robust fintech ecosystem. First, financial innovation should serve the real economy. Strengthening data connectivity through public-private partnerships is essential to promoting inclusive and accessible financial services. For example, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the Commercial Data Interchange (CDI), a platform that enables small and medium-sized enterprises to share business data with banks to facilitate credit assessment. To date, the CDI has supported over 60 000 loan applications with loans granted exceeding US$6.5 billion. Second, regulators should encourage innovation to drive market developments while maintaining effective oversight. Hong Kong's financial regulatory bodies offer regulatory sandboxes that allow financial institutions and tech companies to test innovative fintech solutions, with feedback from regulators to help refine and improve these solutions before full-scale implementation. Third, in light of the increasingly widespread application of digital assets and AI in financial services, economies should place strong emphasis on ensuring that such innovations are responsible and sustainable - including the need to safeguard investor interests and maintain financial stability. Mr Chan stated that Hong Kong is actively engaged in cross-border co-operation and policy dialogue on digital finance, and stands ready to deepen collaboration with regional partners in these areas.

At the session on fiscal policy, Mr Chan shared Hong Kong, China's economic strategy, which includes solidifying its strengths as an international financial and trading centre, while fostering growth of emerging industries such as innovation and technology. He also outlined the Government's fiscal consolidation plan, which focuses primarily on containing expenditure growth, complemented by modest revenue measures based on user-pay and affordability principles. Meanwhile, it is leveraging private sector capital through public-private partnerships and bond issuances to expedite the development of the Northern Metropolis, injecting new impetus into economic development.

During the meeting, Mr Chan also held bilateral discussions with the Chair of the Meeting, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance of the Republic of Korea, Mr Koo Yun-cheol, to discuss further co-operation in trade, finance, and innovation and technology.

Mr Chan will attend the joint session of APEC Finance Ministers' Meeting and Structural Reform Ministerial Meeting tomorrow morning (October 22), before departing for Beijing. He will lead a government delegation to visit the Beijing subsidiary administrative centre and the Xiong'an New Area in Hebei."

At the session on digital finance, Mr Chan highlighted that blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly advancing digital financial services. These technologies not only improve efficiency and reduce costs, but also play a key role in driving financial inclusion. Drawing on Hong Kong, China's experience, he shared three key observations on developing a robust fintech ecosystem. First, financial innovation should serve the real economy. Strengthening data connectivity through public-private partnerships is essential to promoting inclusive and accessible financial services. For example, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the Commercial Data Interchange (CDI), a platform that enables small and medium-sized enterprises to share business data with banks to facilitate credit assessment. To date, the CDI has supported over 60 000 loan applications with loans granted exceeding US$6.5 billion. Second, regulators should encourage innovation to drive market developments while maintaining effective oversight. Hong Kong's financial regulatory bodies offer regulatory sandboxes that allow financial institutions and tech companies to test innovative fintech solutions, with feedback from regulators to help refine and improve these solutions before full-scale implementation. Third, in light of the increasingly widespread application of digital assets and AI in financial services, economies should place strong emphasis on ensuring that such innovations are responsible and sustainable - including the need to safeguard investor interests and maintain financial stability. Mr Chan stated that Hong Kong is actively engaged in cross-border co-operation and policy dialogue on digital finance, and stands ready to deepen collaboration with regional partners in these areas.

At the session on fiscal policy, Mr Chan shared Hong Kong, China's economic strategy, which includes solidifying its strengths as an international financial and trading centre, while fostering growth of emerging industries such as innovation and technology. He also outlined the Government's fiscal consolidation plan, which focuses primarily on containing expenditure growth, complemented by modest revenue measures based on user-pay and affordability principles. Meanwhile, it is leveraging private sector capital through public-private partnerships and bond issuances to expedite the development of the Northern Metropolis, injecting new impetus into economic development.

During the meeting, Mr Chan also held bilateral discussions with the Chair of the Meeting, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance of the Republic of Korea, Mr Koo Yun-cheol, to discuss further co-operation in trade, finance, and innovation and technology.

Mr Chan will attend the joint session of APEC Finance Ministers' Meeting and Structural Reform Ministerial Meeting tomorrow morning (October 22), before departing for Beijing. He will lead a government delegation to visit the Beijing subsidiary administrative centre and the Xiong'an New Area in Hebei."
Incoming passengers jailed for possessing and importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and for importing alternative smoking products (with photos),2025-10-21 18:50,2025-10-21 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100702.htm,"âTwo incoming male passengers were sentenced to six weeks and 10 months' imprisonment by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts and the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts respectively today (October 21) for importing and possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes, failing to declare them to Customs officers, as well as for importing alternative smoking products, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO). One of them was also fined $1,000.

Customs officers intercepted a 62-year-old incoming male passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on October 11 and seized 1 781 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $7,300 and a duty potential of about $5,900 from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today in contravention of the DCO.

Also, Customs officers intercepted a 37-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on August 25. About 33 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes and about 140 000 alternative smoking products, with a total estimated market value of about $573,000 and a duty potential of about $111,000, were seized from his personal baggage. He was subsequently arrested. The man was sentenced to 10 months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today in contravention of the DCO and IEO.

Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

The fifth seminar in the series, on the topic of ""Upholding Principles and Innovation in Chinese Arts and Culture and International Communication"", was delivered by Vice President of China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Professor Gao Shiming, and chaired by the Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the China Institute of Fudan University, Mr Eric Li, at the CSC today (October 21).

  Addressing the seminar, the Head of the CSC, Mr Oscar Kwok, said that Hong Kong is rooted in profound traditional Chinese culture while also being deeply influenced by Western culture, developing a cultural perspective that blends the East and the West. It is especially evident in the realm of popular culture, such as film and music, where Hong Kong has made unique contributions and has served as an important window for the world to appreciate the diverse charms of both Hong Kong and Chinese culture. Hong Kong thus serves as a ""cultural interpreter"" in strengthening international cultural exchange. Hong Kong attracts outstanding talent from around the world, boasts world-class arts and cultural infrastructure, and stands as one of the world's leading arts trading centres. As an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange, Hong Kong should fully leverage its advantages to promote innovative development in arts and culture while advancing mutual learning among civilisations.

  About 140 civil servants in directorate, senior, and middle ranks from 39 bureaux/departments attended the seminar in person or online today.

  The Executive Series on Brokering North and South: China in a Multipolar World invites renowned scholars and leaders from the Mainland and overseas as guest speakers to inspire civil servants to reflect on the influence of China, as a major player in a multipolar world, on the global community amid the rise of the Global South and profound changes in the international landscape, and to explore how Hong Kong, as a city where East meets West, should leverage its strengths in its unique role in connecting the country with the world. It covers subjects pertaining to the rise of the Global South and international order, upholding principles and innovation in arts and culture and international communication, and a holistic approach to national security and global initiatives, among others."

今年財長會議聚焦討論環球和亞太區的經濟情況與展望、數字金融、各經濟體的公共財政政策等議題。

陳茂波在會上的各個環節都發言。在討論環球和區域經濟展望時，陳茂波表示，環球經濟增長在單邊主義和關稅的挑戰下有放緩的勢頭，當前世界經濟正面臨極大不確定性，一些經濟體還須面對合作與脅迫之間，以及共同繁榮與狹隘私利之間的抉擇。他指出，在這個背景下，中國香港堅定維持自由開放的貿易與投資環境，為全球企業和資本提供穩定、先後一致和可預期的營商環境。他呼籲各成員經濟體堅定維護以規則為本的多邊貿易體系，團結合作，推動區域經濟的可持續增長。

在討論數字金融的環節上，陳茂波指出，區塊鏈技術和人工智能正引領數字金融服務快速發展，它們不單能提升效率和降低成本，也有助推動普惠金融。他以中國香港的經驗，分享了對金融科技生態發展的三點意見。一、金融創新應服務實體經濟，而通過公私營合作，能推動更普惠包容的金融服務。他以數據互通為例，指出香港金融管理局推出「商業數據通」平台，通過數據共享以便利中小企融資，至今已支援逾6萬宗貸款申請，並批出超過65億美元的貸款。二、監管機構除履行監管職責外，亦應鼓勵創新，推動市場發展。他以香港金融監管機構的「監管沙盒」為例作說明，表示金融機構和創科公司均可利用這沙盒，測試其創新金融科技方案的可行性，過程中還可參考監管機構的回饋，以進一步改善其最後方案。三、在數字資產及人工智能越趨廣泛應用於金融服務的背景下，各經濟體應重視有關創新是否負責任和可持續，包括須顧及投資者利益和金融穩定。陳茂波表示，香港積極參與數字金融的跨境合作與政策對話，並願與區內夥伴深化在相關領域的合作。

在討論公共財政政策的環節上，陳茂波分享了中國香港的經濟發展策略，包括鞏固國際金融中心和貿易中心等優勢產業，並推動創科等新興產業發展。此外，他也簡介了政府的財政整合計劃，以控制政府開支增長為主，並按「用者自付」及「能者多付」的原則適度提高收入為輔。同時，亦會積極運用市場資源，例如公私營合作及發債等，以提速發展北部都會區，為經濟注入更大的發展動能。

陳茂波在出席財長會議期間也與會議主席、韓國經濟副總理兼企劃財政部長官具潤哲會面。雙方討論如何加強在經貿、金融和創科領域的合作。

陳茂波明日（十月二十二日）上午出席亞太經合組織財長會議與結構改革部長會議的聯合會議，其後轉往北京，率領政府代表團考察北京城市副中心和河北雄安新區。"

​財政司司長在韓國仁川出席亞太經合組織財長會議（附圖）,2025-10-21 18:20,2025-10-21 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100684.htm,"財政司司長陳茂波今日（十月二十一日）在韓國仁川出席亞太區經濟合作組織（亞太經合組織）財政部長會議（財長會議），並與會議主席、韓國經濟副總理兼企劃財政部長官具潤哲會面。

今年財長會議聚焦討論環球和亞太區的經濟情況與展望、數字金融、各經濟體的公共財政政策等議題。

陳茂波在會上的各個環節都發言。在討論環球和區域經濟展望時，陳茂波表示，環球經濟增長在單邊主義和關稅的挑戰下有放緩的勢頭，當前世界經濟正面臨極大不確定性，一些經濟體還須面對合作與脅迫之間，以及共同繁榮與狹隘私利之間的抉擇。他指出，在這個背景下，中國香港堅定維持自由開放的貿易與投資環境，為全球企業和資本提供穩定、先後一致和可預期的營商環境。他呼籲各成員經濟體堅定維護以規則為本的多邊貿易體系，團結合作，推動區域經濟的可持續增長。

在討論數字金融的環節上，陳茂波指出，區塊鏈技術和人工智能正引領數字金融服務快速發展，它們不單能提升效率和降低成本，也有助推動普惠金融。他以中國香港的經驗，分享了對金融科技生態發展的三點意見。一、金融創新應服務實體經濟，而通過公私營合作，能推動更普惠包容的金融服務。他以數據互通為例，指出香港金融管理局推出「商業數據通」平台，通過數據共享以便利中小企融資，至今已支援逾6萬宗貸款申請，並批出超過65億美元的貸款。二、監管機構除履行監管職責外，亦應鼓勵創新，推動市場發展。他以香港金融監管機構的「監管沙盒」為例作說明，表示金融機構和創科公司均可利用這沙盒，測試其創新金融科技方案的可行性，過程中還可參考監管機構的回饋，以進一步改善其最後方案。三、在數字資產及人工智能越趨廣泛應用於金融服務的背景下，各經濟體應重視有關創新是否負責任和可持續，包括須顧及投資者利益和金融穩定。陳茂波表示，香港積極參與數字金融的跨境合作與政策對話，並願與區內夥伴深化在相關領域的合作。

在討論公共財政政策的環節上，陳茂波分享了中國香港的經濟發展策略，包括鞏固國際金融中心和貿易中心等優勢產業，並推動創科等新興產業發展。此外，他也簡介了政府的財政整合計劃，以控制政府開支增長為主，並按「用者自付」及「能者多付」的原則適度提高收入為輔。同時，亦會積極運用市場資源，例如公私營合作及發債等，以提速發展北部都會區，為經濟注入更大的發展動能。

陳茂波在出席財長會議期間也與會議主席、韓國經濟副總理兼企劃財政部長官具潤哲會面。雙方討論如何加強在經貿、金融和創科領域的合作。

陳茂波明日（十月二十二日）上午出席亞太經合組織財長會議與結構改革部長會議的聯合會議，其後轉往北京，率領政府代表團考察北京城市副中心和河北雄安新區。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-21 18:20,2025-10-21 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100698.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 21), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 42 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 2 086 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (October 12 to 18), showing a decrease compared to the previous week (October 5 to 11), which reported 2 257 cases. Most of the cases (795 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen last week, followed by Foshan (241 cases), Shenzhen (202 cases) and Guangzhou (189 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Dr Choi said she expected that schools would incorporate the content of the book into the learning and teaching of relevant subjects, deepening students' understanding of Hong Kong's participation in the War of Resistance. This way, students could appreciate the indomitable spirit of the Chinese nation, cherish the hard-earned peace and prosperity today, and be inspired to contribute to the country and society.

She noted that in order to implement the initiatives outlined in the Policy Address to advance patriotic education, the EDB continuously adopts a multipronged and co-ordinated approach to integrate patriotic education into daily learning and teaching for strengthening students' affection for and sense of belonging to the country.

謝展寰歡迎國家代表團到訪時表示，特區政府十分重視本地漁農業，並會配合國家發展方向促進漁農業可持續發展。特區政府會繼續推動《漁農業可持續發展藍圖》下的措施，協助漁農民轉型至現代化和可持續作業模式，期望可以吸引更多年輕人投身業界，並融入粵港澳大灣區的發展布局，長遠提升本地漁農產品的質、量和產值。

漁農自然護理署（漁護署）署長黎堅明向代表團介紹特區政府在支持漁農業發展的工作，包括在新魚類養殖區發展深海養殖、推出「漁＋樂」魚場計劃以推動休閒漁業、發展都市農業，以及推動業界發展多層式現代化環保養豬場等。

代表團透過在香港仔魚類批發市場調研漁獲上岸及銷售情況，了解魚統處為漁業界提供的服務涵蓋冰鮮海魚批銷服務、活海鮮批發和潔淨海水供應服務，以及推廣本地漁產品；而所得盈餘都用於支援本地漁業的發展，包括改善市場服務和設施，以及為漁民提供低息貸款等。代表團亦與本地漁民代表會面及品嘗本地具特色的加工漁產品。

Mr Tse welcomed the delegation and said that the HKSAR Government attaches great importance to the local agriculture and fisheries industries and promotes their sustainable development by complementing the direction of national development. The HKSAR Government will continue to implement measures under the Blueprint for the Sustainable Development of Agriculture and Fisheries to helpfishermen/farmers switch to modernised and sustainable operation modes, attract more young people to join the industry, integrate into the development plan of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and enhance the quality, quantity, and output value of local agricultural and fisheries products in the long run.

The Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, Mr Mickey Lai, introduced to the delegation the Government's work in supporting the development of the agriculture and fisheries industries, including developing deep-sea mariculture in new fish culture zones, launching the ""Fish enJoy"" Scheme to promote leisure fisheries, developing urban farming, and promoting the development of a multi-storey, modernised, and environmentally friendly pig farm by the industry.

Through inspecting the landing and sale of catches at the Aberdeen Wholesale Fish Market, the delegation understood that the FMO has been providing the fisheries industry with services such as wholesale of chilled fish and live seafood, supply of clean seawater, as well as promoting local fisheries products. All profits are then used to support the development of local fisheries, including improving market services and facilities and providing low-interest loans to fishermen. The delegation also met with local fishermen and tasted local processed speciality fisheries products.

The FMO, established under the Marine Fish (Marketing) Ordinance (Cap. 291), is a financially independent non-profit organisation led by the Director of Marketing, a post concurrently held by the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation. The Aberdeen Wholesale Fish Market is one of the busiest fish wholesale markets under the FMO. In 2024, the market handled approximately 4970tonnes of chilled marine fish and about 3622tonnes of live seafood, accounting for around 15 per cent and nearly 50 per cent of the FMO's total wholesale volume, respectively."

黃恩諾表示，過去六十年，國家動用了大量人力及物力推行多項擴建、改造工程及生態環保措施，並限制開發東江流域沿線保護區，以及在受保護範圍內禁止採石、開礦及進行大規模禽畜養殖等活動，以保障供港東江水水質，香港用以儲存東江水的水塘才能孕育出優質魚，體現民間智慧「養好魚先養好水」。今次參賽作品數目超出預期，收到許多高質素的作品。冠軍作品將用作本地水塘優質魚產品的品牌標誌。

水務署定期在水塘投放魚苗並撈捕已完全成長的魚，以維持水塘生態平衡及水質優良。其中，本地水塘船灣淡水湖繼去年底成功註冊為優質養魚場，今年八月亦獲頒發有機水產養殖認證，魚類的質量備受認可。為善用資源和推廣本地優質魚產品，水務署聯同魚類統營處推出鮮味魚湯系列以及百分百香港本地鯪魚燒賣，於今年八月的香港美食博覽首次公開發售。另外，部分魚產品將贈予非牟利機構，藉此向社區表達關懷。"
Celebration of the 60th Anniversary of Dongjiang Water Supply to Hong Kong - Good Water Good Fish Logo Design Competition results announced (with photos),2025-10-21 17:15,2025-10-21 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100608.htm,"To celebrate the 60th anniversary of Dongjiang's water supply to Hong Kong, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) organised the Good Water Good Fish Logo Design Competition with an aim of conveying an important message that local reservoirs being able to produce high-quality reservoir fish is attributable to the high-quality Dongjiang water stored in them. The competition attracted an overwhelming response, with nearly 500 entries received from Hong Kong and other places. Judging was held today (October 21), during which a champion, first runner-up, and second runner-up were selected. The adjudication panel comprised internationally renowned artist Dr Kan Tai-keung; Legislative Council Member (Tourism) Mr Perry Yiu; the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Water Supplies, Professor Joseph Kwan; the Director of Water Supplies, Mr Roger Wong; as well as representatives from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, the design industry, and the fisheries sector.

Mr Wong remarked that over the past 60 years, the country has mobilised a large amount of labour and resources to implement a number of expansion and improvement works as well as ecological conservation measures along the Dongjiang River Basin, in which development has been strictly restricted with activities such as quarrying, mining, and large-scale livestock farming prohibited within protected zones to safeguard the quality of Dongjiang water supplied to Hong Kong. Dongjiang water stored in local reservoirs in Hong Kong can thus nurture high-quality fish, with the traditional wisdom ""To cultivate good fish, one must first maintain good water"" being proved right. The number of entries for the competition has exceeded expectations, with many high-quality entries received. The winning entry will be used as the logo for high-quality fish products from local reservoirs.

The WSD regularly releases fish fry into local reservoirs and catches mature fish to maintain an ecological balance and preserve good water quality. The local Plover Cove Reservoir was registered as an accredited fish farm at the end of 2024 and received its organic aquaculture certification in August this year. The fish caught from this reservoir are recognised for their remarkable quality. To make efficient use of these resources in reservoirs and promote local high-quality fish products, the WSD is collaborating with the Fish Marketing Organization to produce umami fish soup products and 100 per cent local mud carp siu mai, which were first offered for sale at the Hong Kong Food Expo this August. Additionally, some fish products are donated to non-profit organisations to benefit the community."

政務司副司長出席2025香港國際ESG論壇暨年度榜單評選頒獎典禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-21 16:53,2025-10-21 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100500.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（十月二十一日）出席2025香港國際ESG論壇暨年度榜單評選頒獎典禮的致辭：

衣學東主任（國務院國有資產監督管理委員會研究中心主任）、張政偉主任（國際可持續準則理事會主席特別顧問兼北京辦公室主任）、李萌副處長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室經濟部金融處副處長）、鄭勇男副董事長（香港大公文匯傳媒集團副董事長、總經理）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友︰

大家好！很高興參加由香港大公文匯傳媒集團舉辦的2025香港國際ESG論壇暨年度榜單評選頒獎典禮。

行政長官的二○二五年《施政報告》推出了數項有利於推動環境、社會及企業管治（ESG）發展的舉措，包括：推動新能源產業發展，加速綠色技術落地，例如建設可持續航空燃料產業鏈和落實《香港氫能發展策略》；以及推動綠色創科成果商品化，例如支持市場發展換電型電動車及自動化換電站技術，和推動市場加快為現有建築物減碳等。

今天活動的主題名為「綠色金融匯聚，價值共創新生」，展示了推動ESG發展和綠色金融的密切關係。接下來，我想與大家分享香港在綠色和可持續金融方面的最新發展。

作為國際金融中心，香港正朝着國際綠色金融中心的方向邁進。香港擁有既深且廣的資本市場，能為不同發展階段的企業提供多元化的投融資渠道，同時把國際資金引導至優質的可持續發展項目。截至今年六月，獲證券及期貨事務監察委員會認可的ESG基金超過200隻，資產管理規模超過1.1萬億港元，分別較三年前增加51%及18%。在債券市場方面，去年在香港安排發行的綠色和可持續債券總額約3,354億港元，佔地區總額約四成半，並自二○一八年起連續七年居於亞洲區市場的首位。此外，在政府可持續債券計劃下，我們自二○一九年起已成功發行合共約2,400億港元等值的政府綠色債券，涵蓋不同類型、貨幣種類和年期，為多個本地綠色項目融資，並為潛在發行人提供重要基準。

香港是全球領先的可持續金融樞紐。特區政府全力推動符合國際標準、且一致和可比較的氣候及可持續發展的相關資訊的披露，以提升資本市場就相關資訊的透明度，便利投資者作出投資決策。去年十二月，我們推出《香港可持續披露路線圖》，就大型公眾責任實體不遲於二○二八年全面採用國際財務報告可持續披露準則（簡稱ISSB準則）提供清晰的路徑。今年六月，香港亦獲得國際財務報告準則基金會確認為首批以全面採用ISSB準則為目標的司法管轄區，顯示香港作為推動採用ISSB準則的先鋒。

為更好地結合金融科技和綠色金融，推動經濟綠色轉型，我們積極拓展綠色金融科技的生態圈，打造香港成為綠色金融科技樞紐。政府於去年六月推出全新的綠色和可持續金融科技概念驗證測試資助計劃，提供前期資助，推動進行綠色金融科技活動的科技公司或研究機構與本地企業合作，開發處理行業痛點的新項目，助力有關方案商業化和完成概念驗證。該計劃至今已批出60個綠色金融科技方案，並正陸續通過概念驗證，讓有潛力的綠色和可持續金融科技能在香港的商業環境中更廣泛應用。

嘉賓們、朋友們，ESG生態圈的發展有賴我們每一位的積極參與和支持。我呼籲在座各位把握今天的機會，與其他參加者交流討論，就推動香港以至全球綠色轉型及可持續未來的工作，貢獻智慧和力量。我亦祝賀今年在香港國際ESG年度榜單評選中獲獎的80間公司及機構。感謝你們為ESG建設作出的卓越貢獻，不但鼓勵更多企業走向綠色轉型，同時亦向世界展示國家在推動ESG發展和管理中的積極性和進步性。

最後，我亦想為一件關係香港未來的大事，作出呼籲。立法會的高水平、有效運作，對推動香港的經濟社會發展，至為關鍵。第八屆立法會的選舉，將在十二月七日舉行。我請大家到時踴躍參與投票，以手上一票，為「一國兩制」在香港的成功實踐行穩致遠，以及特區良政善治、長治久安和美好的未來，盡愛國愛港者的責任，貢獻力量。謝謝大家。​"

海關當日根據風檢評估於機場海關驗貨場檢查一個從沙特阿拉伯進口，報稱載有魚乾的空運貨物。經查驗後，海關人員在其中五個紙箱內檢獲該批懷疑受管制海參。一名貨物收貨人被捕。

案件仍在調查中，不排除會有更多人被捕。

海關會繼續透過風險評估和情報分析，嚴厲打擊各類型走私活動。

走私受管制瀕危物種屬嚴重罪行，根據《保護瀕危動植物物種條例》，任何人如非按照《條例》規定進出口或管有瀕危物種均屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一千萬元及監禁十年。

Based on risk assessment, Customs on that day examined an inbound air cargo consignment from Saudi Arabia, declared as dried fish, at the Customs Cargo Examination Compound at HKIA. Upon inspection, Customs officers found the batch of suspected scheduled sea cucumbers in five carton boxes therein. A cargo recipient was arrested.

An investigation is ongoing. The likelihood of more arrests is not ruled out.

Customs will continue to take stringent enforcement actions against all kinds of smuggling activities through risk assessment and intelligence analysis.

Smuggling of scheduled endangered species is a serious offence. Under the Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants Ordinance, anyone importing, exporting or possessing specimens of endangered species not in accordance with the Ordinance commits an offence and will be liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for 10 years upon conviction.

以下是立法會內務委員會主席李慧琼今日（十月二十一日）於立法會綜合大樓會見傳媒的發言︰

早前的內務委員會會議上，議員同意由我以內務委員會主席身分，在明日的立法會會議上，動議告别議案。

近日，有不同議員就告别議案的安排，向我表達意見。有部分議員關注到，新一屆立法會選舉提名期於十月二十四日，即星期五開始，與最後一次立法會會議辯論時間其實是非常接近，而最新的評估是，選情是異常激烈，亦有部分議員擔心，如果在立法會會議上進行告別議案辯論，有可能對選舉造成不公平。

亦有部分議員向我表達，由於選舉提名期即將展開，希望爭取更多時間聚焦處理選舉事宜。當然亦有部分議員希望繼續辯論。

經過審慎考慮所有因素，並與核心組的成員商量，以及跟不同議員溝通後，我決定撤回動議告別議案的預告，讓議員可以更加聚焦處理議會工作，亦確保選舉的公平性。"

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由十月二十日中午截至今日（十月二十一日）中午，食安中心已對219個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on October 20 to noon today (October 21), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 219 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 173 992 samples of food imported from Japan (including 113 543 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 39 158 samples of local catch respectively.

創新科技及工業局局長出席騰雲香港科創集群加速器開幕典禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-21 15:00,2025-10-21 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100519.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（十月二十一日）在騰雲香港科創集群加速器（騰雲加速器）開幕典禮的致辭：

尊敬的黃濤先生（騰雲加速器聯合創始人、世紀金源集團總裁）、方方先生（騰雲加速器聯合創始人、香港水木投資集團合夥人）、張鈺晶會長（中國機電產品進出口商會會長）、鄭松岩總裁（香港數碼港管理有限公司行政總裁）、葛明博士（工業專員（創新及科技））、謝副局長（深圳市前海深港現代服務業合作區管理局副局長謝暉暉）、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：

大家好！今天我非常高興與各位一同見證騰雲香港科創集群加速器落戶數碼港。

初創企業的蓬勃發展對一個地區科技創新和產業創新的發展至關重要：除了為經濟提供新動能和更多可能性之外，同時可以匯聚資源、吸引人才。在特區政府的大力推動下，香港初創企業數目去年已經達到4 700間，這些都顯示了香港的創科初創生態發展日益蓬勃。

為進一步完善本地創科生態圈，加快推動香港發展成為國際創新科技中心，行政長官在去年的《施政報告》中提出創科加速器先導計劃，目的是吸引海內外具豐富經驗的初創加速器落戶香港，建立加速器基地，進一步豐富本地專業初創服務。該計劃上月已獲得立法會財務委員會通過撥款，將為香港的初創企業提供更全面和精準的扶持，促進初創企業做大做強。

騰雲香港科創集群加速器的成立及啓用響應了特區政府扶持初創企業的政策方向。我非常感謝黃濤先生、方方先生等一批企業家、投資銀行家，以及行業專家共同發起成立騰雲加速器，攜同70多家聚焦人工智能、生物醫藥、醫療器械、能源科技等領域的優秀創科企業及投資機構來港發展，利用數碼港的優勢，為進駐的企業提供全面服務，助其在香港落地、布局、發展。加上特區政府即將推出的優化版創科創投基金及即將在明年推出全新的創科產業引導基金，將為香港創科企業的發展創造更為有利的條件。

香港是國家「引進來、走出去」的雙向通道，亦是內地企業進軍海外市場的首選出海平台。特區政府銳意發展創科，有別於以往企業需要個別建立或引進的模式，加速器的成立可以一次性地引進以支持大批初創企業並提供更精準及具系統性的支援，產生集群效應，體現香港支持初創企業發展質和量的提升。我歡迎騰雲加速器引入的多間優秀創科企業及投資機構來港發展，也期望不久的將來有更多優秀的加速器基地在港成立，共同深耕香港的創科樂土。

最後，祝賀騰雲加速器和在座各位業務蒸蒸日上！祝國家及香港的創科品牌在國際舞台上越發亮麗！謝謝大家！"
