"DH reminds public that new phase of tobacco control measures to take effect on January 1, 2026 (with photos)",2025-12-29 11:40,2025-12-29 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/29/P2025122900227.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) today (December 29) reminded the public that three amendments relating to smoking offences under the Tobacco Control Legislation (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 (the Amendment Ordinance) will take effect on Thursday (January 1, 2026):


extension of statutory No Smoking Areas (NSAs) to public places that lie within three metres outside the entrances/exits exclusively used for child care centres, residential care homes, schools, hospitals and specified clinics or health centres;
prohibition of smoking while queuing (including queuing to board a public transport carrier at a designated boarding location, staying in the delineated area for a designated boarding location, while queuing to enter specified premises (see Annex), or while queuing within specified premises); and
increase of the fixed penalty for smoking offences from $1,500 to $3,000.


The Tobacco and Alcohol Control Inspectors of the DH will prosecute any person who does a smoking act in NSAs without prior warning. Offenders will be liable to a fixed penalty of $3,000.

The Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) has prepared FAQs, pamphlets and other resources to help the public comply with the new law. Members of the public may visit the TACO website for more detailed information. To ensure smooth implementation of the new measures, TACO has enhanced publicity and education efforts over the past few months, such as Announcements in the Public Interest on TV and radio; advertisements on public transport areas at bus stops and at MTR stations; enhanced social media promotion; and the production of guidelines to educate the public. For visitors, TACO has stepped up anti-smoking promotions at all boundary control points, major tourist attractions and bus stops, including distributing leaflets in major tourist spots in collaboration with district councillors and has created an infographic ""Visitors' Guide"" to enhance visitors' understanding of the new measures. TACO is also promoting to visitors through Chinese Mainland social media.

TACO has also issued implementation guidelines and enhanced interdepartmental co-ordination mechanisms for the new offences under the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance to ensure smoother enforcement. Briefings have been held for venue managers to explain the details of the amendment and their enforcement. Beyond enforcement, TACO continues to promote smoking prevention and cessation services, including conducting smoke-free publicity and education in the community to raise public awareness of smoking hazards.

The new phase of tobacco control measures will be implemented in phases. Among them, the increased penalties for illicit cigarettes and the prohibition on provision of smoking products to persons under the age of 18 have already taken effect upon the gazettal of the Amendment Ordinance(September 19, 2025). The provision prohibiting the possession of alternative smoking product (ASP) substances (e.g. e-cigarette liquids/cartridges/ and heat sticks) in public places will take effect on April 30, 2026, i.e. four years after the implementation of the ban on the importation and sale of ASPs. TACO will continue to strengthen publicity, education, etc, in the future to ensure the effective implementation of the relevant tobacco control measures.

For the health of individuals, families and the community, the Government urges smokers to quit smoking as soon as possible. Members of the public may call the Department of Health Integrated Smoking Cessation Hotline at 1833 183. The hotline is answered by registered nurses who provide professional counselling and referral to a wide range of free smoking cessation services."

Special traffic and transport arrangements for Kai Tak Stadium concerts on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day,2025-12-29 11:00,2025-12-29 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/29/P2025122800363.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (December 29) said that special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented to facilitate the holding of concerts at Kai Tak Stadium on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day evenings. As the traffic in the vicinity of the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) is expected to be heavy, concertgoers should opt for public transport and avoid driving or taking private cars (including cross-boundary private cars).

  The TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators to strengthen their services during dispersal. The Tuen Ma Line (TML) and East Rail Line (ERL) of MTR will shortenthe interval between trains or arrange standby trains to strengthenservices when necessary. Franchised bus companies will provide 11 special bus routes at the Sung Wong Toi Road Pick-up/Drop-off Area (PUDOA) to Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port and Airport, and major districts across the territory.

  The Kai Tak Stadium Taxi PUDOA will be open. The Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA will be open for taxi drop-off only during admission (6.30pm to 9pm on New Year's Eve and 4.30pm to 7pm on New Year's Day) and suspended fortaxi pick-up/drop-off during dispersal. The expected waiting time will be longer amid the outflowof spectators, and passengers' patience is appreciated.

  According to the organiser, the two concerts are expected to end at around 0.30am and 10.30pm on New Year's Day. Concertgoers who plan to return to the Mainland on the same day should pay special attention to the operating hours of public transport services to boundary control points:

(1) Lo Wu Control Point: Travellers should catch the last relevant MTR TML train, followed by interchanging at Tai Wai Station on the ERL to Lo Wu Station. They should plan their journeys ahead and arrive at the station platform in advance. Departure times of relevant trains are as follows:





Concert on December 31, 2025
Concert on January 1, 2026


Sung Wong Toi Station
0.58am on New Year's Day
10.59pm


Kai Tak Station
1am on New Year's Day
11.01pm




(2) Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang (LMC/HG) Port (operating 24 hours): Travellers may also take the ERL to Sheung Shui Station and then KMB route No. 276B or N73, or take the special bus route No. SP12 directly at the Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA to the Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange, and transfer to the LMC-HG cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) for their journey to the Mainland.

(3) Shenzhen Bay Port (passenger clearance services to operate round the clock on New Year's Eve): Franchised bus companies will operate two special bus routes, Nos. NB2 and NB3, during the small hours, providing services to and from Yuen Long/Tin Shui Wai, and to and from Tuen Mun, respectively. Travellers of the New Year's Eve concert can also take the TML to Yuen Long Station/Tin Shui Wai Station and Tuen Mun Station, and interchange with special bus routes, Nos. NB2 and NB3 respectively, to the Shenzhen Bay Port.

  In addition, concertgoers may take the KTSP's cross-boundary coach services to return to the Mainland during dispersal. Passengers should purchase tickets from the operators' online platforms in advance. On-site ticket sales will not be available during dispersal.

  Spectators are advised to heed the real-time information via the on-site broadcast and the ""Easy Leave"" platform (easyleave.police.gov.hk) as well as the latest traffic news through the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk), the HKeMobility mobile app and radio and television broadcasts."
食安中心公布第二次總膳食研究有關除害劑殘餘的結果,2025-12-29 11:00,2025-12-29 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/29/P2025122400584.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（十二月二十九日）公布香港第二次總膳食研究的第四份報告，評估香港市民從膳食攝入除害劑或代謝物殘餘的分量和相關健康風險。結果顯示，攝入量一般或高的本港成年人口和較年輕群組，從膳食攝入除害劑或代謝物殘餘的分量均低於相關健康參考值，對健康構成風險的機會不大。此外，本港成年人從膳食攝入相關除害劑或代謝物殘餘的分量，與香港首個總膳食研究的結果大致相近或有所下降。

是次研究共檢測374個混合樣本，涵蓋187種食物，分析共101種除害劑或其代謝物殘餘含量，包括四組（新菸鹼類、有機磷類除害劑、氨基甲酸酯類和二硫代氨基甲酸酯類代謝物）共75種除害劑或其代謝物，以及26種其他個別除害劑。

研究發現，有39種（39%）除害劑或代謝物未有在任何混合樣本中檢出；而其餘62種（61%）則在混合樣本中以單獨或組合形式檢出低水平，主要是蔬菜和水果等植物源性食物。在四組除害劑或其代謝物中，新菸鹼類的檢出率最高，佔所有樣本的49%；其次為有機磷類（37%）及氨基甲酸酯類（26%）。總括而言，香港市民從膳食攝入相關除害劑或代謝物殘餘的分量均低於其各自的健康參考值。

中心發言人說：「是次研究分析的除害劑或代謝物常用於農作物作為除蟲劑、除草劑、除真菌劑等。除害劑對人體健康造成的不良影響，視乎其毒性，以及除害劑殘餘的攝入量和攝入期而定。一般而言，只要耕種者嚴格遵守優良務農規範使用除害劑，農作物或相關動物源性食物中只應殘留可接受水平的除害劑，不會對公眾健康構成風險。」

發言人強調，研究結果再次確定現行的基本健康飲食建議是安全的，即應保持均衡和多元化的飲食，包括進食多種蔬果。

香港第二次總膳食研究評估香港市民和不同人口組別從膳食攝入一些可能有潛在食物安全風險的化學物質的分量，以及評估攝入該些物質對健康帶來的風險。市民可從中心網頁下載已公布的相關研究報告www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_firm/programme_tds_2nd_HKTDS_report.html。"

CFS announces Second Hong Kong Total Diet Study findings on pesticide residues,2025-12-29 11:00,2025-12-29 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/29/P2025122400585.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (December 29) released the fourth report under the Second Hong Kong Total Diet Study, which assessed the dietary exposure of the Hong Kong population to residues of pesticides or their metabolites and the associated health risks. The findings showed that the dietary exposure estimates of both average and high consumers in the local adult and younger populations to the pesticide or metabolite residues analysed were all below the respective Health-based Guidance Values (HBGVs), indicating that they would be unlikely to pose health risks to the local population. Moreover, the dietary exposure of the adult population to residues of the relevant pesticides or their metabolites was comparable to or lower than those reported in the First Hong Kong Total Diet Study.

A total of 101 pesticides or their metabolites, including 75 under four groups, namely neonicotinoids (neonics), organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs), carbamates, and dithiocarbamate (DTC) metabolites, and 26 other individual pesticides, were analysed in 374 composite samples involving 187 food items.

Results showed that 39 pesticides (39 per cent) were not detected in any composite samples and the remaining 62pesticides or metabolites (61 per cent) were detected at low levels in the composite samples, either singly or in combination, predominantly in plant-based food such as fruits and vegetables. Among the four groups of pesticides or metabolites, neonics was the most commonly detected, in 49 per cent of all composite samples, followed by OPPs (37 per cent) and carbamates (26 per cent). Overall, the dietary exposure estimates of the Hong Kong population to the pesticide or metabolite residues analysed were below their respective HBGVs.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The pesticides or their metabolites analysed in the study are commonly employed on crops as insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, etc. The adverse health effects of pesticides on humans depend on their toxicity, as well as the amount and duration of exposure to the pesticide residues. In general, when pesticides are used under strict adherence to Good Agricultural Practice, only acceptable amounts of pesticide residues should remain in the crops or foods of animal origin, which would not pose health risks to the public.""

The spokesman emphasised that the findings re-affirmed the safety of basic dietary advice on healthy eating, i.e. have a balanced and varied diet which includes a wide variety of fruits and vegetables.

The Second Hong Kong Total Diet Study aims to estimate the latest dietary exposure of the Hong Kong population and various population subgroups to some chemical substances of potential food safety concern, and assess the associated health risks. The public can download the relevant study reports released thus far from the CFS webpage at www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_firm/programme_tds_2nd_HKTDS_report.html."
"New ""continuous contract"" requirement under Employment Ordinance applicable from January 18, 2026",2025-12-29 11:00,2025-12-29 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/29/P2025122400474.htm,"A spokesperson for the Labour Department (LD) said today (December 29) that the amendments to the ""continuous contract"" requirement under the Employment Ordinance (EO) (Cap. 57) made by the Employment (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 will be applicable from January 18, 2026.

The new requirement will lower the working hours threshold of the ""continuous contract"" and introduce flexibility in the calculation of working hours, reducing the circumstances that disrupt the continuity of an employee's employment when the working hours of a week occasionally fall below the threshold. This change makes it easier for employees to enjoy comprehensive employment rights, such as statutory holiday pay and paid annual leave.

Upon the application of the new requirement, an employee is regarded as being employed under a ""continuous contract"" if he has been employed continuously by the same employer for four weeks or more; and has met one of the working hours requirements: (i) worked for at least 17 hours each week; or (ii) (if worked less than 17 hours in any week) worked for the employer concerned for 68 hours or more in a four-week periodcomprising that week and the three weeks next preceding that week.

The new requirement has no retrospective effect. For an employment period before the new requirement is applicable, an employee is still required to be employed continuously by the same employer for four weeks or more and has worked for at least 18 hours or more each week to meet the ""continuous contract"" requirement.

Other provisions of the EO will operate as they currently do, and employees will continue to enjoy various statutory benefits.

  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has been actively advancing the initiative of Cross-boundary Public Services. Following the installation of the self-service kiosks earlier in the nine Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), the newly set up Cross-boundary Public Services self-service kiosk in Macao provides a total of 70 public services from 14 Hong Kong government bureaux and departments as well as related organisations, encompassing areas commonly used by enterprises and the public. These include taxation, company registration, property and vehicle enquiry and registration, personal identification documents and talent admission applications, welfare and education, healthcare, immigration clearance, urgent assistance, culture and tourism as well as voter registration.

  Starting today, the public can use the Hong Kong Cross-boundary Public Services self-service kiosk located at the Macao Government Services Centre to perform data entry, document scanning and result printing, enabling one-stop access for applying various public services of Hong Kong.

  The opening hours of the self-service kiosk at the Macao Government Services Centre are 9am to noon and 1pm to 6pm, Monday to Friday (except public holidays in Macao). An ""iAM Smart"" self-registration kiosk is also set up at the Services Centre to enable Hong Kong residents working and living in Macao to register for ""iAM Smart+"" and directly access over 1 300 online services provided by the Government and public/private organisations and e-Forms through the ""iAM Smart"" mobile app. These include eMPF registration, renewal of vehicle licences, applications for International Driving Permits and eHealth registration.

  The Hong Kong Cross-boundary Public Services self-service kiosks and ""iAM Smart"" self-registration kiosks have fully covered the nine Mainland cities of the GBA and Macao.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-12-28 19:03,2025-12-28 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/28/P2025122800543.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月二十八日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名35歲女子，居於葵青區。初步調查顯示，她於十二月二十日至二十一日與家人參加旅行團到訪廣東省肇慶市，並曾在當地郊外環境被蚊子叮咬。她在十二月二十五日出現關節痛，翌日出現皮疹，並於昨日（十二月二十七日）出現發燒，同日到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

病人有三名家居接觸者，曾一同參加旅行團到訪肇慶市，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。中心會主動聯絡其餘39名同行團友，向其提供健康建議及醫學監察。

流行病學調查顯示病人的住所和日常活動範圍與過去一個月內錄得的輸入或本地個案沒有重疊的地方，而她在潛伏期亦沒有前往青衣自然徑。由於病人在潛伏期曾到訪廣東省，亦跟香港過去一個月內錄得的個案沒有流行病學關連，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，會把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自十二月十日確診一宗於十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。
	

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。
	

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-28 19:03,2025-12-28 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/28/P2025122800548.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (December 28), the CHP has recorded one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
-----------------------------
 The case involves a 35-year-old female living in Kwai Tsing District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she joined a package tour to Zhaoqing in Guangdong Province with family members from December 20 to 21, and had suffered mosquito bites in rural areas there. She developed joint pain on December 25, followed by rash on the following day, and a fever yesterday (December 27). She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospital on the same day and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. She is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing.

The patient has three household contacts, who joined the same package tour to Zhaoqing. They are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.The CHP will proactively contact the remaining 39 individuals who joined the same package tour, and provide health advice and medical surveillance to them.

An epidemiological investigation showed that her residenceand usual activity areas do not overlap with those among imported or local cases recorded inthe pastmonth.She did not visit the Tsing Yi Nature Trails during the incubation period either. As the patient visited Guangdong Province during the incubation period, and no epidemiological linkages have been established between thecase and other cases recorded in Hong Kongin the past month, the CHP considered that the case was infected duringhertravel. The caseisclassified as imported. The CHPwillreport the cases to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10 of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.
	

  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.
	

  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Nearly 4 000 graduates, having completed their one-year intensive foundation programme with the support of the government, the business sector and the community, demonstrated their achievements in the ceremony and expressed their gratitude to the mentors.

The ceremony was officiated by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki. The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak; the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun; the Acting Secretary for Education, Dr Sze Chun-fai; the Director of Social Welfare, Mr Edward To; and the Acting Director of Home Affairs, Ms Belinda Wong, also attended the ceremony to witness the graduation of the mentees.

Mr Chan expressed his gratitude to all partners and mentors in the ceremony. He remarked that the successful implementation of the Programme hinges on the close collaboration among the government, the business sector and the community in supporting mentees in pursuing their dreams, while participating partners and departments also offered a wealth of group activities and nominated outstanding mentors to inspire mentees for personal growth and exploration.

Reflecting on the past three cohorts of the Programme, Mr Chan noted that the number of enterprises and groups supporting the Programme increased from over 100 in the first cohort to over 400 in the third cohort. The number of Mainland study and exchange tours rose from five in the first cohort to 35 in the third cohort, setting footprints in an array of destinations such as Harbin, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Ningxia, Sichuan, Xian, Wuhan, Hainan and the Greater Bay Area. The number of star mentors also registered a significant jump from over 10 in the first cohort to 50 in the third cohort, testifying that the Programme is keeping pace with the time in various dimensions.

In particular, Mr Chan thanked the mentors for their outstanding contributions to nurturing the younger generation. They have walked alongside the mentees, boosting their self-confidence, developing a positive outlook on life, and helping them set clear goals for the future and pursue with resilience. About 400 mentors have participated in the Programme for all three cohorts, with some continuing their support in the fourth cohort.

Mr Chan encouraged the graduates to actively participate in the activities of the Alumni Club to expand their social networks and sustain the Programme's effectiveness.

Among the graduates of the third cohort of the Programme, 150 mentees were awarded for their active participation, improvement and outstanding achievements. Performances by mentees, including band shows and singing, dancing and ocarina, were also featured at the ceremony to showcase their achievements to the audience. Videos were also shown at the ceremony to feature the thoughts of mentors and mentees.

The Programme is formulated and implemented by an interdepartmental task force led by the Chief Secretary for Administration. Through the tripartite collaboration among the government, the business sector and the community, the Programme provides focused support for Secondary One to Secondary Four students from underprivileged families. It comprises three key elements, including mentorship, personal development plans and financial support. The fourth cohort of the Programme will soon commence and offer a one-year intensive foundation training. Through mentorship and a structured programme, mentees will broaden their horizons, reinforce self-confidence, develop a positive outlook on life, explore more possibilities for personal development, set goals for the future and strive for upward mobility."

He remarked that the successful implementation of the Programme hinges on the close collaboration among the government, the business sector and the community in supporting mentees in pursuing their dreams, while participating partners and departments also offered a wealth of group activities and nominated outstanding mentors to inspire mentees for personal growth and exploration.

Reflecting on the past three cohorts of the Programme, Mr Chan noted that the number of enterprises and groups supporting the Programme increased from over 100 in the first cohort to over 400 in the third cohort. The number of Mainland study and exchange tours rose from five in the first cohort to 35 in the third cohort, setting footprints in an array of destinations such as Harbin, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Ningxia, Sichuan, Xian, Wuhan, Hainan and the Greater Bay Area. The number of star mentors also registered a significant jump from over 10 in the first cohort to 50 in the third cohort, testifying that the Programme is keeping pace with the time in various dimensions.

In particular, Mr Chan thanked the mentors for their outstanding contributions to nurturing the younger generation. They have walked alongside the mentees, boosting their self-confidence, developing a positive outlook on life, and helping them set clear goals for the future and pursue with resilience. About 400 mentors have participated in the Programme for all three cohorts, with some continuing their support in the fourth cohort.

Mr Chan encouraged the graduates to actively participate in the activities of the Alumni Club to expand their social networks and sustain the Programme's effectiveness.

Among the graduates of the third cohort of the Programme, 150 mentees were awarded for their active participation, improvement and outstanding achievements. Performances by mentees, including band shows and singing, dancing and ocarina, were also featured at the ceremony to showcase their achievements to the audience. Videos were also shown at the ceremony to feature the thoughts of mentors and mentees.

The Programme is formulated and implemented by an interdepartmental task force led by the Chief Secretary for Administration. Through the tripartite collaboration among the government, the business sector and the community, the Programme provides focused support for Secondary One to Secondary Four students from underprivileged families. It comprises three key elements, including mentorship, personal development plans and financial support. The fourth cohort of the Programme will soon commence and offer a one-year intensive foundation training. Through mentorship and a structured programme, mentees will broaden their horizons, reinforce self-confidence, develop a positive outlook on life, explore more possibilities for personal development, set goals for the future and strive for upward mobility."
Civil Aid Service holds Passing-out Parade for 91st Recruits (with photos),2025-12-28 17:00,2025-12-28 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/28/P2025121900480.htm,"  The Civil Aid Service (CAS) held the Passing-out Parade for the 91st Recruits at its headquarters today (December 28). The parade was reviewed by the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, Mr Chan Tsz-tat.

  Speaking at the parade, Mr Chan said that as an excellent auxiliary emergency service of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, the CAS has always adhered to the spirit of ""Serving the Community with Passion, Courage and Commitment"". In September this year, when Super Typhoon Ragasa approached Hong Kong, the CAS quickly mobilised over 500 members to assist in emergency rescue operations during the heavy rain and strong winds, as well as the community recovery work after the typhoon. Last month, a major fire occurred in Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, causing significant casualties. The whole city was in mourning. The CAS immediately activated the command centre and to date has deployed over 2 200 personnel to support the evacuation and resettlement of the affected residents, distribution of supplies, and other tasks, standing firm on the front line of disaster relief.

  He said that at the 15th National Games held last month and the 2025 Legislative Council General Election held earlier this month, the CAS, with efficient and professional services, assisted in crowd management at various sports venues and polling stations across the territory, ensuring the events were conducted safely and in an orderly manner.

  In terms of youth development, Mr Chan said that the CAS and the Customs and Excise Department share the same goal. Since the establishment of the Cadet Corps in 1968, the CAS has been encouraging young people to develop their potential and establish positive values through various activities. This coincides with Hong Kong Customs' ""Customs YES"" programme, which aims to cultivate a new generation with a sense of national identity, social responsibility, and an international perspective, supporting young people to integrate into the country's overall development.

  During the ceremony, Mr Chan presented awards to outstanding recruits. The graduates staged demonstrations of vegetation firefighting and rescue techniques.

  A total of 29 officer trainees and 83 recruits participated in the passing-out parade. All graduates are from diverse backgrounds. The CAS Recruit Training Certificate Programme has been recognised under the Hong Kong Qualifications Framework as meeting the accreditation standards at Level 3 by the Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications. Graduates will be awarded the Certificate in Auxiliary Forces Basic Training (Civil Defence). The graduates will apply their acquired knowledge and skills to serve society.

  Recruitment of CAS Grade IV Officers and Grade I Members is open for application throughout the year. Recruitment details and application forms are available on the CAS website (www.cas.gov.hk/eng/adult_recruitment.html)."

他說，上月舉辦的第十五屆全國運動會，以至本月初剛圓滿舉行的二○二五年立法會換屆選舉，民安隊均以高效專業的服務，協助各個運動場館及各區選舉票站實施人群管理，確保活動安全有序地進行。

在青年培育方面，陳子達說，民安隊與海關目標一致。自一九六八年成立少年團至今，民安隊一直透過多元活動，鼓勵青少年發展潛能和建立正面價值觀。這與海關近年推出的「香港海關青年發展計劃」（Customs YES）的理念不謀而合，兩者皆以培養具國家觀念、社會責任感和國際視野的新一代為使命，支持青年融入國家發展大局。

在典禮中，陳子達頒發獎項予優異隊員。結業學員亦進行了撲滅山火及搶救技術示範。

各位「共創明『Teen』計劃」的合作夥伴、各位友師、各位家長、各位學員：

大家好！今日我很開心出席「共創明『Teen』計劃」第三期畢業禮，與大家一起見證約4 000名學員的學習成果。

剛才司儀都有提到，「共創明『Teen』計劃」自二○二二年推出以來，已經走到第三年。計劃得以成功推行，實在有賴政、商、民三方的通力合作，為學員提供除了資助之外，亦有各式各樣的資源；亦要感謝各位合作夥伴——大家可能不知道甚麼叫合作夥伴，就是香港很有名的企業，他們出錢、出力、出心，亦多謝其他部門舉辦豐富、多姿多彩的團體活動，並推薦了優秀的友師，陪伴學員一路成長。

看到支持計劃的企業和團體越來越多，由第一期的100多個團體，增加至第三期的400多個團體，實在令我感到非常欣慰，亦充分體現了社會各界的熱心支持。

星級導師的數目亦由第一期的十多位，增加到第三期的50多位，這些星級導師是香港非常忙碌的人，是各行各業的精英，他們亦抽出寶貴的時間，幫助我們的學員成長，讓學員有機會接觸不同類型的活動，從而認清自己的興趣，發揮所長。

另外，我們根據和學員的溝通，知道他們最喜歡的項目之一就是到內地走走，所以內地研學團的數目，亦由第一期的五個，增加到第三期的35個。學員的足跡亦走遍神州大地，走得更遠，除有大灣區，亦到訪了北京、上海、天津、寧夏、四川、西安、武漢等地。今年七月，我更有機會與部分學員一同到哈爾濱和海南，在海南我們看到了火箭升空，親身了解國家的歷史文化、見證科普發展，認識國家發展的偉大成就，開闊眼界。

我想藉此機會，特別感謝所有參與計劃的友師。感謝你們與學員同行，幫助他們增強自信，建立積極的人生觀，並協助他們定下未來目標。我知道，有大約400名友師已經連續參與三期計劃，我相信他們會參加第四期。我感謝你們為培養所有學員出心出力，為各位作出最大的貢獻。

此外，我亦見證了不少學員的師兄師姐，在畢業後參與「共創明『Teen』校友會」的活動。有些師兄師姐更擔任青年委員，負責策劃及舉辦活動，以至展開職埸體驗，實踐生涯規劃。我希望他們由參與者變為策劃者。我亦很開心有一些大型公司和我說，他們願意將來待學員適齡工作的時候，「共創明『Teen』」的校友會得到優先聘請。

各位畢業學員，我鼓勵你們畢業後一定要積極參加校友會活動，因為這些校友會活動可幫助你們拓展人際網絡，延續計劃的成效。

我更希望你們能夠帶着在計劃中收穫的自信、眼界與友誼，繼續勇敢前行，在未來更加廣闊的舞台上，不斷探索、不斷嘗試，創造更多屬於自己的多姿多彩故事。

最後，我代表特區政府，再次向所有合作夥伴、星級導師及各位友師，致以最衷心的感謝！亦希望各位學員繼續努力，增值自我、發揮所長，朝着夢想進發， 開創更美好明天！多謝大家！"

Final Kilometre of East Coast Boardwalk to open tomorrow connecting 13 km long harboufront on Hong Kong Island (with photos) ,2025-12-28 12:00,2025-12-28 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/28/P2025122800100.htm,"  The Eastern Section of the East Coast Boardwalk in North Point will open to the public at 6am tomorrow (December 29), marking the last kilometre to connect the approximately 13 kilometre long harbourfront on Hong Kong Island, from Kennedy Town to Shau Kei Wan, fulfilling one of the visions of harbourfront developments.

Spanning some 2.2 kilometres underneath the Island Eastern Corridor, the East Coast Boardwalk is divided into the eastern and western sections, each with a length of 1.1 kilometres. The Western Section, connecting the East Coast Park and the North Point Promenade, was opened earlier this year, and has been well received by the public. The Eastern Section, opening tomorrow, will further connect the North Point Promenade to Hoi Yu Street in Quarry Bay, realising the vision of “Seamless Boardwalk Linking Island West and East”.

Similar to the Western Section, the Eastern Section will open be 24 hours a day (except for the experiential glass observatory deck), and will offer a number of special features, including:


An experiential glass observatory deck, providing visitors with direct views of the harbour beneath the Boardwalk.The observatory deck will be open from 10am to 6pm daily. It will be temporarily closed in case of adverse weather.Visitors entering the observatory deck will be required to wear shoe covers provided on site, mainly for safety purpose and for protection of the glass surface;
A pet-friendly area near Tin Chiu Street, allowing visitors and their leashed pets to relax and play before heading to the Boardwalk to enjoy the view of the Victoria Harbour.Kiosks and multi-purpose space with provision of food and beverages are expected to open in the area in the first quarter of next year;
A number of multi-functional open spaces for hosting exhibitions, art and community activities upon application.Several local artists have been invited to enliven these spaces with art installations, as well as to showcase graphics of marine life and the Eastern District mascot ""Dong Dong"" visiting popular attractions in the District on the bridge piers; and
A small plaza at the eastern end of the Boardwalk near Quarry Bay, along with a widened footpath at Hoi Yu Street to improve accessibility.


Similar to the Western Section, the Eastern Section adopts the management approach of a Harbourfront Shared Space and a pet-friendly venue. It features a shared path for visitors to engage in activities, such as strolling, jogging and cycling, while also providing a dedicated walkway for pedestrians as an additional option. Pet owners and their leashed pets can enjoy the facilities together. A movable bascule bridge has also been installed near Man Hong Street to facilitate marine operations.

The five access points to the Eastern Section (see Annex) are listed below from west to east:


Turn right from Shu Kuk Street towards North Point Promenade (about a 4-minute walk from Exit A1 of North Point MTR Station);
Via a pedestrian ramp at Java Road adjacent to the North Point Vehicular Ferry Pier (about a 5-minute walk from Exit A1 of North Point MTR Station);
Via a link bridge from Man Hong Street (about a 8-minute walk from Exit A1 of North Point MTR Station);
Via a link bridge from Healthy Street East (about a 5-minute walk from Exit C of Quarry Bay MTR Station; a stair lift for wheelchair users will be installed in the third quarter next year); and
Via Hoi Yu Street (about a 5-minute walk from Exit C of Quarry Bay MTR Station).


An additional access point with a lift and staircase next to Tin Chiu Street Playground will be available in the first quarter of next year."

東岸板道餘下一公里明日開放　貫通十三公里港島海濱（附圖）,2025-12-28 12:00,2025-12-28 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/28/P2025122800075.htm,"北角東岸板道（東段）明日（十二月二十九日）上午六時起開放予公眾使用，開通這「最後一公里」，標誌由堅尼地城至筲箕灣全長約13公里的港島海濱正式貫通，實現海濱發展的願景之一。

位於東區走廊下的東岸板道，全長約2.2公里，分為東西兩段，各長約1.1公里。貫通東岸公園及北角海濱花園的西段自今年初開放，深受大家歡迎，而明日開通的東段連接北角海濱花園及鰂魚涌海裕街，達致「一板貫通，暢踏西東」。

東段與西段一樣，24小時開放（體驗式玻璃觀景台除外），並引入不少特色設施，包括：


體驗式玻璃觀景台，讓遊人可感受腳下的維港。開放時間為每日上午十時至下午六時，如天氣欠佳，觀景台將暫停開放，而進入觀景台的巿民須穿上由場地提供的鞋套，主要是為了安全起見及保護玻璃；
近電照街的寵物友善區，讓巿民與牽繩寵物放鬆放電，再一起踏上板道賞維港，該處亦設有明年首季開放的小食亭和可提供餐飲服務的多用途室；
數個多功能開放式空間，可供申請舉辦展覽、藝術和社區活動。多位本地藝術家亦為空間增添生氣，除設置藝術裝置外，亦在橋墩展示海洋生物和東區吉祥物「東東」遊覽東區人氣景點的圖案；及
最東端近鰂魚涌入口設有小型廣場，而相連的海裕街行人路已經擴闊，提高暢達度。


東段同樣採用西段「海濱共享空間」和人寵共融的管理模式，設有共享徑供市民進行步行、緩跑、騎單車等活動，同時亦設有行人專用路徑，提供額外選擇。牽繩寵物可與其主人一起享受東段設施。另外，在民康街附近亦設開合橋，配合船隻運作需要。

東段設有五個出入口（見附件），由西至東分別如下：


經書局街右轉入北角海濱花園（由北角港鐵站A1出口步行約四分鐘）；
經渣華道北角汽車渡輪碼頭旁的行人斜道（由北角港鐵站A1出口步行約五分鐘）；
經民康街連接橋（由北角港鐵站A1出口步行約八分鐘）；
經健康東街梯級橋（由鰂魚涌港鐵站C出口步行約五分鐘，此入口明年第三季起加設輪椅樓梯升降機）；及
經海裕街（由鰂魚涌港鐵站C出口步行約五分鐘）。


另外經電照街遊樂場旁的升降機及樓梯將於明年首季開放。"
