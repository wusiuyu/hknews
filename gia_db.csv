Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-22 19:30,2025-11-22 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/22/P2025112200701.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 22), the CHP has recorded one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
------------------------------

The new case involves a 66-year-old male living in Kwai Tsing District. The patient and the imported case involving a 60-year-old female announced yesterday, are from the same family. They visited Shenzhen in Guangdong together on November 17. The CHP conducted epidemiological investigations yesterday (November 21) on the case involving the 60-year-old female and found that the 66-year-old male patient has developed joint pain since November 20. The CHP immediately referred him to the Accident and Emergency Department of Yan Chai Hospital to undergo examination and blood test. His blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient has been admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. He is now in stable condition.

The aforementioned patients have one household contact who travelled to Shenzhen with them. This person concerned is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 As the patient has visited CF-affected areas for travel during theincubation period,the CHP preliminarilyconsidered that the case was infected during his travel. The case is classified as imported. The CHP will report the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 68 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

 Furthermore, in light of the local case involving a 68-year-old female who lives in Tung Hei Court in Shau Kei Wan, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 4 950 individuals through the health consultation booth on 2/F, Hing Tung Shopping Centre in Shau Kei Wan, its inquiry hotline, questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits at Tung Hei Court. Four individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests, and all testednegative for the chikungunya virus.The enquiry hotline (2125 2373) continues to operate daily from 9am to 6pm.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-22 18:55,2025-11-22 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/22/P2025112200682.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月二十二日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————

新增個案涉及一名66歲男子，居於葵青區，與昨日公布涉及一名60歲女子的輸入個案來自同一個家庭。二人於十一月十七日一同到訪廣東省深圳市。中心昨日（十一月二十一日）就該60歲女子進行流行病學調查時，發現66歲男病人於十一月二十日起出現關節痛，隨即轉介病人到仁濟醫院急症室接受檢查及進行驗血檢測。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，已獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。

上述兩名病人尚有一名家居接觸者，三人曾一同到深圳市，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於個案在潛伏期曾前往受基孔肯雅熱影響的地方旅遊，中心初步認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，會把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據
——————
本港今年累計錄得68宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

另外，因應一宗涉及一名住在筲箕灣東熹苑的68歲女子的本地個案，中心透過設於筲箕灣興東商場二樓的醫護站、熱線電話、問卷及於東熹苑進行上門探訪，為逾4 950名市民進行評估，亦為四名早前出現輕微病徵的市民進行抽血檢查，全部對基孔肯雅病毒的檢測為陰性。查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）目前繼續每日由上午九時至下午六時運作。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及

Mr Kevin Yeung (Chairman of the Hong Kong Fashion Designers Association), Consuls-General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. On behalf of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), I would like to extend a warm welcome to all of you at the opening of ""VIRTUOSE: The Artistry of Couture 2025"".

Couture originated in late 19th century Paris, representing the highest level of design and craftsmanship in fashion. It transforms the most exquisite fabrics into breathtaking masterpieces. Given its rich heritage and enduring influence, we have chosen a couture-themed event as the opening of our second Hong Kong Fashion Fest.

Often perceived as a solemn and traditional art form, couture carries a legacy of elegance and prestige. However, today's event offers a fresh perspective, reinterpreting couture through international collaboration and youthful creativity. The upcoming fashion show will feature an exceptional lineup of visionary international designers – Caroline Hu from Hong Kong, Zhaoyi Yu from the Chinese Mainland, Tomo Koizumi from Japan, and Peet Dullaert from France. Notably, the average age of these designers is only 33, yet they have already received prestigious awards and showcased their outstanding designs on the runways of international fashion weeks. They represent a vibrant new force shaping the future of global couture.

With their exceptional craftsmanship, 40 remarkable pieces will soon be showcased against the iconic backdrop of Victoria Harbour. I'm truly excited to witness this stunning display of creativity and artistry.

The excitement does not end today. In the coming days, guests can look forward to trunk shows and a fireside chat with the designers, fostering dialogue with potential couture clients and offering insights into the inspiration behind each piece.

As announced in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"", the Hong Kong SAR Government will continue to advance our annual flagship event – the Hong Kong Fashion Fest – to develop Hong Kong into a fashion design hub in Asia. Building on last year's success, I am pleased to note that the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency has initiated and driven new crossover projects with two renowned Fashion Weeks – Paris and Milan – to jointly promote digital fashion and sustainable fashion in the second edition of the Hong Kong Fashion Fest. This achievement reaffirms our goal of promoting Hong Kong's fashion and textile design brands and enhancing Hong Kong's position as a premier destination for hosting major cultural and creative events.

From today until December 7, seven flagship projects covering couture, digital fashion, denim culture, sustainability, cross-disciplinary collaboration and industry exchanges will be brilliantly showcased in Hong Kong, an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Hong Kong Fashion Designers Association for organising this spectacular event, as well as to all the designers for your invaluable presence and contribution.

Ladies and gentlemen, for those of you from the local community, may I also take this opportunity to encourage you to cast your vote in the 2025 Legislative Council General Election on December 7 to help build an even better Hong Kong.

Now, without further ado, please enjoy the fashion show and the wonderful programmes of the Hong Kong Fashion Fest for the rest of the week. Thank you very much."

The event aims to provide teachers with a practical training platform to foster pedagogical innovations and enhance teaching effectiveness through cross-sector collaboration.

  Speaking at the ceremony, the Under Secretary for Education, Dr Sze Chun-fai, said that in line with the national strategy on digital education, the EDB has been vigorously promoting digital education in primary and secondary schools to enhance students' digital literacy and skills. The Chief Executive proposed in the 2025 Policy Address a series of new policy initiatives to strengthen the promotion of digital education in primary and secondary schools, including setting aside $2 billion in the Quality Education Fund to support digital education in primary and secondary schools, formulating the Blueprint for Digital Education in Primary and Secondary Schools, enhancing AI training for teachers, and introducing corporate resources.

  He said that, to further enhance students' digital literacy, particularly in the application of AI to support learning, the EDB is going to set out an ""AI literacy"" learning framework for teachers' reference. This aims to cultivate ethical use of innovative technologies in students. Additionally, the EDB has been rolling out a series of new training programmes on AI in education for teachers, covering online training, offline exchanges and practical workshops, to support teachers in effectively integrating AI technology into their instruction.

Subsequently, as witnessed by Dr Sze, representatives from the EdCity signed Memoranda of Understanding with several organisations, covering collaborative initiatives such as co-organisation of events to further advance the development of digital education in Hong Kong. The EDB hopes that through cross-sector collaboration, resource sharing and exemplary teaching practices, teachers will be inspired to integrate innovative technologies in the classroom. This will enhance the effectiveness of learning and teaching, cultivating a new digitally literate generation and leading Hong Kong's education towards a new era of intelligence.

The AIED Forum Series is being held from November 20 to 22, featuring keynote speeches, panel discussions, edtech solution exhibition booths and hands-on workshops for teachers. This programme aims to comprehensively enhance teachers' knowledge and skills in application of AI to improve learning and teaching effectiveness. On the first day of the event, an innovation technology expert conducted a cybersecurity workshop to enhance capabilities of school technical staff in cybersecurity management and crisis response. The second day featured an AI forum hosted by an expert from Peking University, showcasing case studies on AI-powered teaching applications in various subjects to teachers. The last day comprises thematic presentations and panel discussions by experts and academics, alongside edtech solution exhibition booths and 14 hands-on workshops of diverse themes, which enabled participants to experience first-hand the practical application of cutting-edge educational technologies in the classroom, engage in exchanges with development teams, and explore AI tools and teaching strategies within interactive learning environments.

經過超過一個世紀變遷，大樓在今天正式展開新的更大使命，成為共享基金會全球總部，將為基金會推展國際醫療援助計劃、推廣人道主義援外工作，注入歷久彌新的堅實力量。

上個月，二十屆四中全會審議通過《中共中央關於制定國民經濟和社會發展第十五個五年規劃的建議》，建議指出要高質量共建「一帶一路」，加強與共建國家戰略對接，深化同共建國家人民「心聯通」。《建議》支持全球南方聯合自強，加大援外力度，弘揚全人類共同價值，為構建人類命運共同體作出中國貢獻。

香港在「一國兩制」下擁有內聯外通的優勢，積極對接國家戰略，加強對外交流合作，發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」作用，一直是共建「一帶一路」的積極參與者、貢獻者和受益者。

我在九月發表的新一份《施政報告》中，提出多項革新措施，包括帶領香港更全面參與和助力共建「一帶一路」。我們將積極擴展經貿網絡，擴展香港經貿辦的覆蓋範圍至拉丁美洲和中亞等全球南方地區。我們也推動建立「一帶一路」綠色發展香港合作平台，並為共建國家人員提供可持續發展培訓課程，加強香港與新興市場在經濟貿易、專業服務、人文交流的合作。

高質量共建「一帶一路」，不但為沿線國家編織聯動發展、合作共贏的經濟紐帶，還盛載着構建人類命運共同體的偉大願景。香港人胸懷大愛、為善最樂，通曉兩文三語，內地和國際網絡廣闊。香港為共建「一帶一路」的民心相通，發揮着專業服務的「硬實力」和關愛共融的「軟實力」。

共享基金會自二○一八年在香港成立以來，不懈為共建「一帶一路」國家提供聚焦國際醫療和公共衞生的人道援助，先後開展白內障手術、登革熱防控、災後援助等不同項目，完成超過2萬3千個免費白內障手術，並有效減低不同國家的傳染病疫情，成果豐碩。

基金會積極推動跨國交流合作，並為青年提供人道援助工作的培訓和實習機會，培育擁抱世界的人道精神，啟發新世代成為援外工作的新力量，攜手向世界展現國家在貢獻構建人類命運共同體的大國擔當。

杏林春雨潤四方，中外薈萃濟蒼生。香港將繼續發揮輻射帶動作用，把中國力量、中國技術、中國關懷傳送到共建「一帶一路」國家，促進民心相通，讓「一帶一路」倡議不但帶來發展與和平，更成為一條彼此共享健康、幸福和善良的連心橋。

最後，我祝願共享基金會會務昌隆，在座各位身體健康。謝謝大家。"

政務司司長出席二○二五年撲滅罪行聯席會議致辭（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-11-22 10:18,2025-11-22 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/22/P2025112200250.htm,"​以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（十一月二十二日）出席二○二五年撲滅罪行聯席會議的致辭：

各位撲滅罪行委員會的委員、各位分區撲滅罪行委員會的主席和委員、各位來賓：

大家早晨！首先，我以撲滅罪行委員會主席的身分，歡迎大家出席二○二五年撲滅罪行聯席會議。

撲滅罪行委員會和分區撲滅罪行委員會自七十年代成立以來，一直是政府的緊密夥伴，以及維持香港繁榮穩定的重要力量。由制定策略到地區宣傳，你們都擔當關鍵角色，衷心感謝各位的努力。

今日香港社會非常安定祥和，政府得以全力拼經濟、謀發展。不過，我們絕對不能夠掉以輕心，特別是香港正處於銳意改革創新、積極融入國家發展大局的關鍵時刻，一個安全穩定的社會環境至關重要。

所以我們必須保持警惕，繼續做好國家安全、防罪滅罪和抗毒的工作，為市民築起一道可靠、堅實的安全屏障。

今日聯席會議亦會聚焦這三方面的範疇。而其實自二○二三年上屆會議後，我們在這三方面都取得顯著成效。

在維護國家安全和推展愛國主義教育方面，除了完成《基本法》第二十三條本地立法，我們亦在今年迎來第十個全民國家安全教育日和《香港國安法》公布實施五周年。在《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》這兩套法律的護航下，香港得以走上「由治及興」的康莊大道。

而在政府和社會各界的共同努力下，社會對國家安全的認知和重視已經達到了新的高度。

去年八月，國家安全展覽廳正式開幕，標誌着我們把國家安全教育做得更深更廣的決心。我們又培訓地區國安導師、發展青年國安大使和成立「愛國主義教育工作小組」，全方位推動愛國教育。

在打擊毒禍方面，政府今年二月迅速修改法例，將新型毒品依托咪酯列為毒品，並透過宣傳推廣，讓市民了解這種毒品的禍害。

適逢今年是禁毒常務委員會成立六十周年，我們也舉辦了粵港澳大灣區禁毒高峰會，匯聚三地專家，一同探討更有效的禁毒策略，推進禁毒合作。

我要特別多謝分區滅罪會積極支持禁毒基金推出的「提升社區禁毒意識計劃」，提升社區人士對毒品問題的認識，共同建設無毒香港。

而在應對詐騙案方面，政府一直採取多管齊下的策略：積極檢視和優化現有法例、加強與金融、通訊等不同業界的合作、全面提升市民防騙意識，並緊貼詐騙趨勢，調整策略與執法方式。

政府的防騙工作成效顯著。詐騙案件宗數的升幅由二○二三年的42.6%，下降到二○二四年的11.7%，並於今年首三季放緩至0.1%。我們會繼續積極推動政府、業界、市民三方面合作，從多角度建立完善反詐騙體系。

我們也積極推進跨區域司法協作，打擊跨境詐騙；與通訊、金融業界聯手推出防騙措施；並透過關愛隊等社區網絡廣泛宣傳，提高市民警覺。

各位委員、各位來賓，防罪滅罪，任重道遠。除了政府的努力，更需要市民配合和全城參與。

展望未來，我深信滅罪會和分區滅罪會會繼續擔當社區安全的參與者和守護者。期望今日會議能集思廣益，凝聚共識，將有關工作做得更全面到位，建設香港成為更美好安全的家園。

藉此機會，我亦要呼籲各位選民在十二月七日的立法會選舉踴躍投票，與家人朋友一起履行公民責任，投下寶貴的一票，選出代表你的立法會議員，為香港的發展和民生福祉貢獻力量。

最後，我祝願會議圓滿成功，各位身體健康。多謝大家。"

各位撲滅罪行委員會成員、各位分區滅罪會委員、各位嘉賓、各位同事：

大家早晨！很高興出席二○二五年撲滅罪行聯席會議，為這個兩年一度的會議揭開序幕。

撲滅罪行委員會肩負制定防罪滅罪計劃、統籌相關工作並監察成效的重要職責；而分區撲滅罪行委員會作為地區治理的重要部分，在地區層面協助提高市民的防罪意識，鼓勵大眾積極參與滅罪工作。

撲滅罪行聯席會議不僅在撲罪、滅罪這方面做了大量工作，亦與分區滅罪會交流，是一個非常重要的平台，更是向市民傳遞滅罪信息、提升社會整體防罪意識的重要渠道。我們透過官民合作，共同守護香港的治安。

今年是《香港國安法》公布實施五周年，聯席會議將「推廣維護國家安全」列為主題之一，正合時宜。

《香港國安法》與去年三月生效的《維護國家安全條例》互相配合、渾然一體，共同為香港構建一套全面而高效的維護國家安全法律制度，堵塞了過往的漏洞，並保障市民依法享有的各種權利和自由。

然而，香港維護國家安全面臨的形勢仍然複雜和嚴峻，正如夏寶龍主任在今年六月的講話中提醒我們，需要牢牢把握「一國兩制」下維護國家安全的實踐要求，把香港來之不易的良好局面維護好、鞏固好。

當前，香港正站在邁向「由治及興」的關鍵節點，政府全力深化改革、發展經濟、改善民生。發展和改革的根本前提是穩定，沒有穩定，發展就沒有基礎；而國家生存和發展的基本要素是國家安全，安全是安邦定國的重要基石。

我們要秉持「總體國家安全觀」，統籌好發展和安全，堅定維護國家安全，堅持推動高質量發展。維護國家安全是每一位市民的責任，更是全社會的義務。只有築牢國家安全屏障，香港才能在穩固的基礎上，有效應對各種風險和挑戰。

在築牢國家安全屏障下，要確保社會穩定，我們須持續深化防罪滅罪工作。今次聯席會議將會重點討論防騙滅罪和抗毒禁毒，回應市民當前關心的議題。尤其面對科技發展日新月異，犯案手法層出不窮，我們要持續提升公眾的防罪意識。市民的支持和配合，是政府及執法部門打擊罪案、維護社會治安的關鍵元素。

各位委員，你們的寶貴意見，有助政府制定更精準有效的保安政策與措施。我期望大家繼續協助政府，推動防罪滅罪工作，提升市民的守法意識，保障市民安居樂業，維持香港繁榮穩定。

要維持香港繁榮穩定，良政善治不可或缺。即將舉行的立法會換屆選舉與市民息息相關，與香港良政善治，更有密切關係。我呼籲大家，在十二月七日投票日，積極履行公民責任，與家人朋友一同投票，為香港選出有能力、有抱負、熱誠服務市民的賢能之士，進入立法會。

最後，我祝願聯席會議圓滿成功，撲滅罪行委員會和分區滅罪會繼續為維持香港治安貢獻力量。多謝大家！"

"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, chikungunya fever and dengue fever",2025-11-21 22:50,2025-11-21 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100883.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 21) reported the latest situation of chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF).

Chikungunya fever
-----------------------

As of 5pm today,two new imported CF cases have been recorded.

The first case involves a 53-year-old female living in Kwai TsingDistrict. Initial investigation revealed that she visited Zhongshan in Guangdong between November 2 and 4. She developed joint pain and rash on November 19, followed by a fever yesterday (November 20). She sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospital on the same day.

The second case involves a 60-year-old female living in Kwai TsingDistrict. Initial investigation revealed that she visited Shenzhen in Guangdong on November 17. She developed joint pain on November 19, followed by rash on the following day (November 20). She sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Yan Chai Hospital on the same day.

Both patients have been admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. They are now in stable condition. Their blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing.

The 53-year-old patient has three household contacts, and five travel collaterals to Zhongshan, who are currently asymptomatic. The 60-year-old patient has two household contacts who travelled with her to Shenzhen. One of them developed mild joint pain. The CHP has referred the person concerned to the Accident and Emergency Department to undergo examination and blood test. All of the abovementioned individuals are under medical surveillance.

 As both patients have travelled to CF-affected areasabout two weeks prior to symptom onset, the CHP preliminarilyconsidered that both cases were infected during their travel. These cases are classified as imported. The CHP will report the cases to the health authority of Guangdong Province. The CHP's epidemiological investigations are in progress.

 Furthermore, in light of the local case involving a 68-year-old female who lives in Tung Hei Court in Shau Kei Wan, the CHP urged the residents living in the vicinity of the patient's residence to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 15. The CHP collaborated with the Eastern District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention and questionnaire surveys to about 3 000 households in the affected areas in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

 As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 4 950 individuals through the health consultation booth on 2/F, Hing Tung Shopping Centre in Shau Kei Wan, its inquiry hotline, questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits at Tung Hei Court. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past six days. Four individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests, and all testednegative for the chikungunya virus.Since the health consultation booth has only sporadic visits recently and all individuals who underwent blood tests have returned negative results, the booth will cease operation starting tomorrow. The enquiry hotline (2125 2373) will continue to operate daily from 9am to 6pm.

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 67 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Dengue fever
----------------

 From November 14 to yesterday (November 20), the CHP recorded one imported DF case. The patient had travelled to India during the incubation period.

 As of yesterday, 54 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. From January to July 2025, over four million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths have been reported in 97 countries/territories.

 DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India and Vietnam have each recorded over 90 000 cases so far this year; Malaysia and Thailand have each recorded over 40 000 cases; and Singapore has also recorded over 3 500 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded 3 339 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 130 cases were recorded in a week between November 3 and 9, with the highest number of cases recorded in Chaozhou, Shenzhen, Shantou, Guangzhou and Foshan.

 Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHP'swebsite.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

 TheFood and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


 The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

 Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

 The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
​銀髮高峰會推動各界合作構建銀髮經濟生態圈,2025-11-21 22:15,2025-11-21 22:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100817.htm,"商務及經濟發展局（商經局）和香港社會服務聯會（社聯）今日（十一月二十一日）合辦銀髮高峰會，以「構建樂齡科技活力經濟生態圈：本地、灣區與國際的新視野」為題，透過跨領域平台，匯聚政、商及社福界代表共同探討銀髮經濟的新機遇，並鼓勵不同界別的機構積極參與及支持銀髮經濟生態圈。銀髮高峰會亦是落實促進銀髮經濟工作組今年五月公布有關促進「銀色消費」的其中一項主要工作。

高峰會設有三場專題討論，雲集來自安老服務、科技創新、金融服務、產業發展及公共政策等領域的專家和持份者，就促進銀髮經濟工作組提出與共建銀髮友善社會相關的五個範疇深入討論，包括促進「銀色消費」、發展「銀色產業」、推廣「銀色品質保證」、推廣「銀色財務及保障安排」和釋放「銀色生產動力」，促進各界認識銀髮經濟的商機，並引領產品供應商及服務提供者把握機遇，共同構建充滿活力的樂齡科技經濟生態圈。

商經局發言人表示：「銀髮經濟是未來消費增長的動力，推動銀髮經濟發展並非局限於發展安老服務，更是科技創新與服務升級的關鍵。」

發言人續說，政府正致力推展五個範疇下的各項措施。在商經局負責牽頭推動的「銀色消費」和「銀色品質保證」方面，社聯與香港中華廠商聯合會等粵港澳三地夥伴共同推動的《適老易食食品（適老照護食）通用要求》已正式獲納入粵港澳大灣區標準清單，政府會繼續鼓勵其他產品和服務提供者積極探討銀髮友善的標準，以改良整體銀色產品的品質及吸引消費。同時，政府會與業界緊密合作，共同推動「銀色品質保證」框架，以保障長者消費權益並鼓勵企業提升品牌信譽。

此外，政府會以樂齡科技為核心，發展「銀色產業」及釋放「銀色生產動力」，藉着北部都會區發展，繼續加強對本地科研機構和初創企業的支持，並為它們提供理想的科研平台，提升這些樂齡科技產業的競爭力。政府亦會大力發展「銀色財務與保障安排」，推動金融科技與退休理財的融合，構建貼近長者需求，以及讓市民能夠安心規劃、放心養老的財務保障體系。

發言人強調，為全面發展銀髮經濟生態圈，香港除了積極擁抱粵港澳大灣區的龐大腹地，專注於研發、標準制定等發展，亦會善用在「一國兩制」的獨特優勢，成為連接國家與世界銀色經濟市場的「超級聯繫人」。"
Silver Summit fosters cross-sector collaboration in building silver economy ecosystem,2025-11-21 22:15,2025-11-21 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100824.htm,"  The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB) and the Hong Kong Council of Social Service (HKCSS) co-organised the Silver Summit today (November 21) under the theme ""Building a Vibrant Gerontech & Silver Economy Ecosystem: Shared Vision for Local, Greater Bay Area & International Development"" to provide a cross-sectoral platform bringing together representatives from the Government as well as the business and social welfare sectors to explore new opportunities of the silver economy and encourage organisations from various sectors to actively participate in and support the silver economy ecosystem. The Summit is a major initiative for boosting ""silver consumption"" as announced in May this year by the Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy.

 The Summit featured three plenary sessions, gathering experts and stakeholders from fields covering elderly care services, technological innovation, financial services, industrial development and public policy for discussions focusing on the five areas on building a silver-friendly society as proposed by the Working Group, namely, boosting ""silver consumption"", developing ""silver industry"", promoting ""quality assurance of silver products"", enhancing ""silver financial and security arrangements"", and unleashing ""silver productivity"". It aimed to raise awareness of the business opportunities brought by the silver economy, and lead suppliers and service providers to grasp the opportunities in jointly building a vibrant gerontechnology economy ecosystem.

A spokesman for the CEDB said, ""The silver economy is a driving force for future consumption growth. Promoting its development is not only limited to developing elderly care services, but also the key for technological innovation and service upgrades.""

 The spokesman added that the Government is sparing no efforts in implementing the various initiatives within the five areas. Regarding the initiatives spearheaded by the CEDB on promoting ""silver consumption"" and ""quality assurance of silver products"", the General Requirements of Dysphagia Diet for Elderly (Care Food) jointly promoted by the HKCSS, the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong and partners from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao is officially included in the list of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) Standards. The Government will continue to encourage other product and service providers to actively explore silver-friendly standards to improve the overall quality of silver products to attract consumption. At the same time, the Government will work closely with the industries to jointly promote the framework for ""quality assurance of silver products"" to protect the consumer rights and interests of the elderly, and encourage businesses to enhance brand reputation.

 In addition, the Government will focus on gerontechnology to develop the ""silver industry"" and unleash ""silver productivity"". Leveraging the development of the Northern Metropolis, the Government will continue to strengthen support for local research institutions and start-ups, providing them with ideal research platforms to enhance the competitiveness of the gerontechnology industry. The Government will also vigorously develop ""silver financial and security arrangements"", promoting the integration of fintech and retirement financial planning to build a comprehensive financial protection system that meets the needs of the elderly and allows citizens to plan and retire at ease.

 The spokesman emphasised that to fully develop the silver economy ecosystem, Hong Kong will actively embrace the vast hinterland of the GBA to focus on research and development and standards formulation, and make good use of the unique advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, serving as a ""super-connector"" between the national and global silver economy markets."
蚊傳疾病基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的最新情況,2025-11-21 22:05,2025-11-21 22:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100826.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月二十一日）公布基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的最新情況。

基孔肯雅熱
—————

截至今日下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

首宗個案涉及一名53歲女子，居於葵青區。初步調查顯示，她於十一月二至四日到訪廣東省中山市。她於十一月十九日出現關節痛及皮疹，並於昨日（十一月二十日）出現發燒，同日到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫。

另一宗個案涉及一名60歲女子，亦居於葵青區。初步調查顯示，她於十一月十七日到訪廣東省深圳市。她於十一月十九日出現關節痛，翌日（十一月二十日）出現皮疹，同日到仁濟醫院急症室求醫。

兩名病人已獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她們的血液樣本均對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

53歲病人有三名家居接觸者，另外有五人與她結伴到中山，暫時都沒有病徵。60歲病人則有兩名家居接觸者，並曾與她一同到深圳市，其中一人有輕微關節痛，中心已轉介該名人士前往急症室接受檢查及進行驗血檢測，上述人士均正接受醫學監察。

由於兩宗個案在病發前約兩星期曾前往受基孔肯雅熱影響的地方旅遊，中心初步認為她們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，會把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。中心的流行病學調查仍在進行中。

另外，因應一宗涉及一名住在筲箕灣東熹苑的68歲女子的本地個案，中心呼籲該名患者居所一帶居民，如於十月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員和東區關愛隊已向東熹苑一帶受影響地區約3 000個單位派發有關預防基孔肯雅熱的資料單張及問卷，提醒居民留意有否相關病徵和注意家居的環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過設於筲箕灣興東商場二樓的醫護站、熱線電話、問卷及於東熹苑進行上門探訪，為逾4 950名市民進行評估，過去六日未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。中心已為四名早前出現輕微病徵的市民進行抽血檢查，全部對基孔肯雅病毒的檢測為陰性。鑑於近日僅有零星市民前往醫護站，加上全部於上述醫護站接受抽血檢查的人士結果均為陰性，相關醫護站將由明日起停止運作，而早前設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）則會繼續每日由上午九時至下午六時運作。

本港今年累計錄得67宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

登革熱
———

由十一月十四日至昨日（十一月二十日），中心錄得一宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期到過印度。

截至昨日，今年錄得54宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。世衞去年（二○二四年）錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。由二○二五年一月至七月，全球97個國家／地區呈報了超過400萬宗登革熱個案及超過3 000宗相關死亡個案。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點亦普遍流行，印度尼西亞、印度和越南今年已分別錄得超過九萬宗個案，馬來西亞和泰國亦分別錄得超過四萬宗個案，新加坡則錄得超過3 500宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得3 339宗本地感染病例，其中130宗病例於十一月三日至九日的一周內錄得，以潮州、深圳、汕頭、廣州和佛山錄得的病例最多。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

繼續加強防控
——————

食物環境衞生署（食環署）聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

•在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
•巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
•加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

•先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
•在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
•塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
•孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
•先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
•遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
•除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。

Seven affected persons sought medical advice and two of them required hospitalisation.All of the affected individuals are currently in stable condition.
 
A preliminary investigation by the CHP revealed that the affected persons had consumed Siu Mei prepared by the concerned food factory, including BBQ pork rice and BBQ pork chicken rice. Officers of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, including personnel of the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch, conducted an investigation at the food factory. They examined the handling process and food hygiene, and collected food and environmental samples for testing. The CFS immediately instructed the premises concerned to immediately stop serving all incriminated food items, clean and disinfect the premises, and provide food safety and environmental hygiene education to the staff.

The investigation of the CHP and CFS is ongoing.

To prevent foodborne diseases, members of the public are reminded to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times. When dining out, one should:


Avoid eating raw seafood;
Be a discerning consumer in choosing cold dishes, including sashimi, sushi and raw oysters at a buffet;
Choose pasteurised eggs, egg products or dried egg powder for dishes that often use undercooked eggs;
Patronise only reliable and licensed restaurants;
Ensure food is thoroughly cooked before eating during a hotpot or barbecue meal;
Handle raw and cooked foods carefully and separate them completely during the cooking process;
Use two sets of chopsticks and utensils to handle raw and cooked foods;
Avoid patronising illegal food hawkers;
Drink boiled water;
Susceptible populations, including those with weakened immunity, the elderly, pregnant women and young children are at a higher risk of foodborne diseases, so they should not consume raw or undercooked foods;
Refrain from trying to use salt, vinegar, wine or wasabi to kill bacteria as they are not effective; and
Always wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet.

不要光顧無牌食物檔；
飲用經煮沸的水；
高危人士（包括免疫力較低的人、長者、孕婦及幼童）患食源性疾病的風險較高，故不應進食生或未經徹底煮熟的食物；
不要試圖用鹽、醋、酒及日本芥末殺菌，因為均沒有殺菌效用；及
進食前及如廁後要洗手。
