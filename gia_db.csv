勞工處發言人說：「在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告取消後，僱員如遇到實際困難而未能及時返回工作崗位，僱主應予以體諒並作出彈性處理，例如讓僱員分批復工、容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

 
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the CHP and the Travel Health Service, the latest Travel Health News, tips for using insect repellents, and the CHP Facebook Page, Instagram Account and YouTube Channel, and also the Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated page of the FEHD."

SFST showcases Hong Kong's strengths to European ministers of finance at high-level conference organised by Ministry of Finance of Slovenia (with photos),2025-09-24 11:40,2025-09-24 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092400284.htm,"  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, attended a high-level roundtable conference with European ministers of finance and financial experts from different regions in Ljubljana, Slovenia,on September 23 (Ljubljana time) and showcased Hong Kong's unparalleled strengths in converging its global advantage and its China advantage in one single city. He also promoted Hong Kong's vibrant financial markets to the Slovenian business community.

   The high-level conference themed ""Unlocking Growth: The Future of Slovenian and European Capital Markets"" was hosted by the Ministry of Finance of Slovenia, and gathered ministers of finance from Croatia, Estonia and Slovenia, theCommissioner for Financial Services and the Savings and Investments Union of the European Commission, as well as many more financial leaders and experts to share insights in driving a more promising future for European capital markets.

  As one of the panellists at the panel discussion titled ""Global Practices in Capital Markets"", Mr Hui said that Hong Kong is strategically located as a premier gateway to connect traditional markets and emerging markets across the world, matching the needs of both sides. Aside from being one of the top three international financial centres in the world, Hong Kong enjoys the advantages brought by the real-world economy and keen investment demand in the Chinese Mainland, turning the city into an enticing pool for global investment.

  He said, ""Just for the first eight months this year, we had 59 companies newly listed in our stock market of 2025, raising a total of EUR14.6 billion through IPOs (initial public offerings) and marking an upsurge of 579 per cent when compared to the same period last year. If you look at the net fund inflows from the Chinese Mainland to Hong Kong, we are talking about a sum close to EUR105.4 billion for the first eight months of 2025. Its turnover is equivalent to 24.5 per cent of our market's overall turnover and surpassing the historical annual levels. In Hong Kong, we have introduced various mutual access programmes to provide diverse asset allocation and risk management options for investors from around the world including Europe in accessing the immense opportunities fuelled by economic growth on the Mainland.

  ""Amid this stellar performance, our Chief Executive just announced in his Policy Address that more targeted initiatives would be rolled out to strengthen our capital market and unlock new areas of economic growth. Measures include attracting more Mainland enterprises to set up corporate treasury centres and more banks to establish their regional headquarters in Hong Kong; expediting the building of an international gold-trading market covering storage, gold refining, trading and clearing; refining policy measures like further enhancing the preferential tax regimes for funds, single family offices and carried interest to keep up the growth momentum of the fund and family office sector; as well as fostering development of fintech, and green and sustainable finance.""

  Mr Hui had a meeting with the Minister of Finance of Croatia, Dr Marko Primorac, on the sidelines of the conference. He also had some deeper exchanges with other panellists at the networking lunch hosted by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Slovenia, Mr Klemen BoštjanÄiÄ.

  In the afternoon, Mr Hui joined a business event organised by the Gospodarska zbornica Slovenije (GZS) which is the largest chamber of commerce and industry in Slovenia. The Slovenian-Chinese Business Council under the GZS aims to strengthen co-operation and business relations between the two countries and help Slovenian companies access the Mainland market.

  Mr Hui told the audience that there is no better time than now to capitalise on the advantages of Hong Kong as the perfect platform to enter the Asian and Chinese Mainland markets. With a world-renowned and robust regulatory regime, Hong Kong's financial markets offer the most stable and predictable environment that is aligned with international practices for investors. The world-class professional services available in Hong Kong can support enterprises to go far.

  The GZS will be leading a business delegation to visit Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland in early November this year, and so far over 50 companies have enrolled. Mr Hui said that it would definitely be a good occasion for Slovenian companies to see for themselves the vast opportunities in the region, and looked forward to future collaboration.

  On September 24 (Ljubljana time), Mr Hui will proceed to Warsaw, Poland, to continue his visit after having meetings with Mr BoštjanÄiÄ and Slovenia government officials."

財庫局局長在斯洛文尼亞財政部高級別會議上向歐洲財政部長展示香港優勢（附圖）,2025-09-24 11:40,2025-09-24 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092400273.htm,"財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇九月二十三日（盧布爾雅那時間）在斯洛文尼亞盧布爾雅那與歐洲各國財政部長及不同地區的金融專家一同出席高級別圓桌會議，並向他們展現香港集合中國與環球優勢於一城的無可比擬實力。他亦向斯洛文尼亞商界推介香港蓬勃的金融市場。

該高級別會議由斯洛文尼亞財政部主辦，以「釋放增長潛力：斯洛文尼亞和歐洲資本市場的未來」為題，匯聚克羅地亞、愛沙尼亞和斯洛文尼亞的財政部長、歐洲聯盟委員會金融服務和儲蓄與投資聯盟專員，以及眾多金融領袖和專家，分享真知灼見，共同推動歐洲資本市場邁向更美好的未來。

許正宇以講者身分參與了「環球資本市場的成功之道」專題討論環節。他表示，香港位處戰略性位置，是連接全球傳統市場和新興市場，契合雙方需求的首要門戶。除獲評為全球三大國際金融中心之一外，香港更受惠於中國內地實體經濟和熾熱的投資需求，成為注目的環球資金池。

他說：「單計今年首八個月，已有59家公司在港新上市，透過公開招股合共集資146億歐元，較去年同期增長579％。如果有留意南向交易流入香港的資金淨額，便會看到二○二五年首八個月的資金淨流入已接近1054億歐元，成交額相當於香港股票市場整體成交額的24.5％，超越以往的年度水平。香港有各種互聯互通項目，為包括歐洲在內的環球投資者提供多樣化的資產配置和風險管理選項，讓他們可抓緊內地經濟增長帶來的無限機遇。」

「香港經濟表現亮麗，行政長官剛在《施政報告》中宣布推出更多針對性措施去強化香港資本市場，開拓新的經濟成長點。這些措施包括吸引更多內地企業在香港設立企業財資中心，以及吸引更多銀行在香港設立地區總部；加快建設涵蓋倉儲、精煉、交易和清算的國際黃金交易市場；完善政策措施，例如進一步優化基金、單一家族辦公室和附帶權益的優惠稅制，以鞏固基金和家族辦公室行業的增長勢頭；以及促進金融科技、綠色和可持續金融的發展。」

會議期間，許正宇與克羅地亞財政部長Marko Primorac博士會談。他還出席了由斯洛文尼亞副總理兼財政部長Klemen Boštjančič舉辦的聯誼午宴，與其他講者深入交流。

下午，許正宇出席斯洛文尼亞最大商會－斯洛文尼亞工商協會（GZS）舉辦的商務活動。GZS旗下的斯洛文尼亞—中國商務委員會旨在加強兩國之間的合作與商貿關係，協助斯洛文尼亞企業進入中國市場。

許正宇表示，現在是善用香港優勢，借助香港這個理想平台進軍亞洲及中國市場的最佳時機。香港金融市場擁有世界知名的完善監管制度，為投資者提供最穩定、具可預見性且與國際慣例接軌的投資環境，而本港世界級的專業服務亦能支持企業走得更廣更遠。

GZS今年十一月初將率領商務代表團到訪香港和內地，至今已有逾50家公司報名參加。許正宇說，斯洛文尼亞的公司將可在到訪期間，親身了解香港和內地的龐大機遇，機會難得，期待它們屆時可以達成一些合作項目。

許正宇九月二十四日（盧布爾雅那時間）在與Boštjančič和政府官員會面後，會轉往波蘭華沙繼續訪問行程。"

"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-09-24 02:45,2025-09-24 03:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092400082.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (September 24) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

僱主／承建商及僱員須注意在暴雨下工作時的電力安全,2025-09-24 02:45,2025-09-24 03:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092400080.htm,"鑑於天文台已發出暴雨警告，勞工處提醒僱主及承建商，當僱員在進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置時，須採取所需的工作安排及適當安全措施，以保障僱員的工作安全。

勞工處發言人今日（九月二十四日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

勞工處印備了安全指南及單張，提供有關電力工作的安全指引。這些安全刊物可在該處各分區辦事處免費索取，亦可從該處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/content2_8.htm）下載。

如有任何有關職業安全及健康的問題，可致電2559 2297，與勞工處職業安全主任聯絡。"
