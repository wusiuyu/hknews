香港流感活躍程度維持在高水平　「全港性污水病毒監測計劃」將涵蓋季節性流感病毒,2025-10-30 19:12,2025-10-30 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000742.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月三十日）表示，本港現時流感活躍度仍然維持在較高水平，而學童是最為受影響的群組。中心敦促學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

流感活躍程度維持在高水平

中心最新監測數據顯示，過去一周（十月十九至二十五日），呼吸道樣本中流感病毒檢測呈陽性的百分比為12.01%，與前一周錄得的11.84%相若，並已超越今年初冬季流感季節最高一周的10.54%。目前主要流行的病毒為甲型（H3）流感，佔整體病毒檢測接近九成，其次為甲型（H1）流感，佔接近一成，餘下則為乙型流感。公立醫院住院病人被診斷為流感的入院率為每一萬人有0.64宗入院個案，低於前一周的0.87宗。學校或院舍的流感樣疾病爆發個案維持在較高水平，截至昨日（十月二十九日），自九月開學以來，涉及學校的流感樣疾病爆發個案共有693宗，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（73宗）、小學（376宗）及中學（244宗）。由九月開學至今，共有16宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，當中包括一宗死亡個案，年齡介乎11個月大至17歲，其中11人過往的健康狀況良好。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「按目前流感活躍程度和趨勢分析，流感活躍程度在未來幾星期預計仍會維持在較高水平。另一方面，氣溫下降，病毒一般會較活躍。香港的冬季流感季節大多在一月至三月期間出現，今次夏季流感季節有可能與下一個冬季流感重疊，導致因感染流感而住院的人數較以往更多。我呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動，特別是高風險群組，例如長者、兒童，及患有慢性疾病和免疫抑制的成年人。市民亦可以聯絡自己的家庭醫生安排接種。」

市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

「全港性污水病毒監測計劃」涵蓋季節性流感病毒

香港一直以來擁有完善的傳染病監測系統，以監測各種傳染病在本港的活躍程度，包括法定呈報傳染病監測、定點監測、聚集性疫情監測、實驗室監測、污水監測等。為進一步加強監測本地季節性流感的能力，中心的「全港性污水病毒監測計劃」將涵蓋季節性流感病毒，以提升監測及預警能力，從而適時制訂公共衞生應對措施，更全面保障公眾健康。

徐樂堅醫生說：「『全港性污水病毒監測計劃』是傳染病監測系統近年的一大突破。新冠疫情期間，利用污水檢測2019冠狀病毒病（新冠）病毒含量的新方法，已成為本地追蹤病毒傳播和識別感染源頭的重要工具。目前，新冠病毒已成為風土病，按一般呼吸道疾病處理，新冠污水監測的目標亦已從個案追蹤轉為恆常監測病毒在社區的活躍程度。」

他續說: 「中心一直不斷研究及優化污水病毒監測計劃，並逐步按研究結果擴展至其他傳染病的監測。中心去年底起開展先導計劃，利用已收集的污水樣本對季節性流感進行數據分析，並與本地現有基於實驗室呼吸道樣本的流感監測趨勢作對比。結果顯示，污水病毒載量與呼吸道樣本的陽性率趨勢高度吻合，確認污水監測能有效反映本地季節性流感情況，污水監測比目前使用的基於醫療機構的監測指標（例如診所、醫院、臨床實驗室）能更早發現趨勢變化。有關結果已於今日出版的新一期《傳染病直擊》發表。因應先導計劃的成功經驗，中心把相關計劃恆常化，作為傳統流感監測系統的補充指標。中心自本周起透過《2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞》每星期發布相關監測數據，予醫護人員和公眾參考。」

徐樂堅醫生說：「衞生署會繼續積極研究污水監測的最新科學發展及應用，按本地流行病學情況，適時擴大污水監測應用範圍至其他傳染病，全方位保障公共衞生和守護市民健康。」

​二○二三年《施政報告》宣布政府會提升本地監測、預警和防控疫情能力，而香港賽馬會出資作支持。「全港性污水病毒監測計劃」為上述項目的一部分。"

He was certified dead later at the scene. The LD is saddened by death of the worker and expresses its deepest sympathy to his family.

The LD's spokesman said, ""We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and have issued a suspension notice to the employer concerned, suspending the use of electric chainsaws for tree-related work. The employer cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that suitable measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken.""

The spokesman added, ""We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the relevant duty holder and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation.""

To prevent employees from being injured while operating electric chainsaws, the LD reminds employers to provide relevant employees with suitable personal protective equipment (including protective clothing, safety boots, protective gloves, safety helmets, eye protectors and ear protectors) as well as adequate information, instruction, training and supervision for the safe operation of electric chainsaws.

The general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance require employers to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

In regard to yesterday's accident, the LD will issue a Work Safety Alert through its mobile application ""OSH 2.0"", website and email, giving a brief account of the accident to duty holders, workers' unions, professional bodies of safety practitioners and others, and reminding the industry of the importance of following safety precautionary measures to prevent a recurrence of similar accidents.

The LD will also remind the employer concerned of the liability for employees' compensation under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, assist family members of the deceased to claim employees' compensation and closely follow up on the case. For those with financial difficulties, the LD will assist them to apply for appropriate emergency funds. Subject to the needs and wishes of the family members of the deceased, the LD will also liaise with the Social Welfare Department for financial or other assistance.

For the sake of securing the safety and health of employees at work, the LD appeals to employers to provide plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health. Employees shall also co-operate with their employers to adopt all safety measures, refrain from wearing loose clothing and use provided personal protective equipment properly while operating electric chainsaws to avoid endangering their own safety and that of other workers."

Two incoming passengers convicted and jailed for importing alternative smoking products and possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2025-10-30 18:35,2025-10-30 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000714.htm,"Two incoming male passengers were each sentenced to three months' imprisonment and four months' imprisonment by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (October 30) for importing alternative smoking products, as well as for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers respectively, in contravention of the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO) and the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO). One of them was also fined $1,500.

Customs officers intercepted a 50-year-old and a 32-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on August 5 and October 29 respectively. About 11 200 alternative smoking products, with an estimated market value of about $33,600, were seized from the personal baggage of the 50-year-old incoming male passenger. Also, about 46 400 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $209,000 and a duty potential of about $153,000 in total, were seized from the 32-year-old male passenger's personal baggage. The two persons were subsequently arrested.
â
The 50-year-old male passenger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment by the court today for contravening the IEO, while the 32-year-old male passenger was sentenced to four months' imprisonment and fined $1,500 for contravening the DCO.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
保安局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-10-30 18:10,2025-10-30 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000700.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（十月三十日）出席《安熊童樂會》校園巡禮啓動儀式後會見傳媒的談話內容：

保安局局長：各位香港市民，各位記者朋友。今日我來到大圍，是為了我們一個進入校園、在幼稚園宣傳國家安全的宣傳活動。其實保安局過往已經用了兩個卡通人物角色——一個叫安仔，另一個叫保安熊仔——用這兩個角色向小朋友宣揚有關國家安全的重要性和一些知識。我們以往有漫畫、繪本和動漫，現在我們更加將兩個卡通人物帶入幼稚園，再加上由保安局青少年制服團隊領袖論壇的一些義工哥哥姐姐朋友用國安隊長的身分，帶領着兩個卡通人物進入幼稚園，講國家安全的故事。我們希望能夠將國家安全的意識，令小朋友從小——在幼稚園中——已經能夠明白。

我亦想趁此機會再提一提大家，十二月七日是立法會換屆選舉的日子，希望大家踴躍投票，選出愛國愛港和有能力的人士，在立法會服務社會。

另外我都想講一講，我留意到在網上有人繼續勸人投白票或不投票。我想重新強調，這些行為不但有機會違反《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》，亦有機會違反《香港國安法》。我們一定會根據證據，如有需要，會採取果斷執法行動。

我特別留意到通緝犯許智峯——這個「叫人衝，自己鬆」、因為違反《香港國安法》而被法庭發出手令通緝、因為說謊欺騙法庭然後潛逃到別處而被通緝，再加上他是因為叫人不投票而違反《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》而被廉政公署通緝的人士——繼續在網上散布叫人不要投票的信息。我想說，這個做法是非常惡毒。你自己違法被人通緝，是你的事，你還想別人跟你一樣犯法。我希望大家能夠認清事實，千萬不要被他蒙蔽而從事一些違法行為。這是我想在此作出的呼籲，謝謝大家。

記者：國安處（警務處國家安全處）今日剛剛落案起訴了吳子樂，即口岸爆炸案其中一個罪脫的被告。想問為何追溯至二○一九年？為何國安處或警方需要六年調查？是否在搜證上有甚麼難度？還有說這是一個全新的罪名，是否其實是等法官宣判口岸爆炸案剩下的三個罪成的被告才採取執法行動？

保安局局長：國安處最近拘捕了五名人士，是與二○一九年黑暴有關，包括煽動暴動和提供武器，而我們今日正式落案控告兩名人士。我想跟大家說，你違了法，特別是危害國家安全或者（涉及）一些煽動暴力的案件，無論你潛逃了多久、離開了多久，只要我們掌握到足夠證據，就會將你拘捕；有進一步足夠證據，就會將你檢控。這是沒有時限的，任何時間，我們有證據就會拘捕、檢控。

記者：想問剛才有提到留意到有人散播投白票，可能會違反《香港國安法》。可否說說是怎樣違反《香港國安法》？除了許智峯的例子之外，會不會留意到有本地的例子有違反？會怎樣執法？

保安局局長：剛才我講過，我留意到潛逃者、逃犯許智峯公然在網上叫人從事一些違法行為。我在此再次譴責和希望提醒市民，不僅不要受騙、做他叫你做的行為，亦不要將相關媒體轉載，因為這有可能是違法。這不但可能違反《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》，而如果你勾結外國勢力從而希望影響或操控選舉，這有機會是違反《香港國安法》。

記者：關於的士司機箍頸案，看到警員林偉榮都提出要求推翻裁決，其實警方是否已開始調查工作？會否考慮刑事檢控？還有會否參考陪審團有關在警車內安裝CCTV的建議？

保安局局長：就着你提到的案件，我們已經留意到死因庭相關判詞。警方現時和律政司已經在研究，究竟下一步應該採取甚麼行動。謝謝大家。"
​行政長官在2025金融街論壇閉幕式致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-10-30 18:00,2025-10-30 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000536.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十月三十日）在2025金融街論壇閉幕式的視像致辭：

各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。我很高興以視頻方式參與2025金融街論壇年會閉幕式。

金融街論壇在二○一二年創辦，現在已成為國家級、國際性專業論壇，是國家重要的國際金融交流合作平台。我首先熱烈恭賀今年金融街論壇年會圓滿成功，成果豐碩。

當前，世界百年未有之大變局加速演進。面對全球經濟和金融環境轉變，世界各地政府以至企業，都要制訂更強韌、可持續的發展戰略，通過創新及共融理念，強化金融市場的合作和發展。今年的論壇以「創新、變革、重塑下的全球金融發展」為主題，匯聚全球多個國家和地區的政府和企業交流互鑑，正當其時。

香港作為國際金融中心，積極發揮「一國兩制」下內聯外通的獨特優勢，為國家金融高質量發展貢獻力量。在最新的《全球金融中心指數》排名中，香港繼續保持全球第三、亞洲第一，與全球第一和第二的分數差距只是兩分和一分，充分肯定香港作為國際金融中心的領先地位。

金融是現代經濟的核心，唯有持續創新、主動變革、勇於重塑，才能在變局中開創新局。我在上月發表的《施政報告》中，提出一系列措施，持續鞏固提升香港國際金融中心地位，同時加速發展經濟新增長點，開拓新機遇。

首先，我們會繼續強化股票市場。今年香港股票市場表現亮麗，今年首九個月的每天平均成交額超過2,500億港元，比去年同期翻了一倍。新股集資額方面，到九月底已累計超過1,800億港元，按年大增兩倍以上，金額位列全球第一。

特區政府會通過新設立的「科企專線」，協助內地科技企業來港融資，為國家建設科技強國貢獻金融力量。我們也會鼓勵及協助在海外上市的中概股回流，讓香港成為它們的首選回歸地。

第二，我們會繼續深化香港與內地金融市場的互聯互通。截至今年九月，「滬深港通」北向交易平均每天交易額超過2,000億人民幣；而南向交易平均每天交易額則超過1,200億港元，反映香港連接內地資本市場的重要橋樑功能。

我們會爭取盡快落實將人民幣交易櫃台納入「港股通」，並將房地產投資信託基金納入互聯互通標的，同時鼓勵更多上市公司增加人民幣股票交易櫃台。

第三，我們會加強香港作為全球最大離岸人民幣業務中心的優勢。目前，香港處理全球約百分之75的離岸人民幣支付款額。截至今年八月底，香港人民幣存款餘額約1萬億元人民幣，為全球離岸人民幣交易和金融活動提供流動性支持。

為了強化香港離岸人民幣市場的樞紐功能，我們會優化目前的人民幣流動資金安排，讓銀行業有更大的空間和彈性，管理短期人民幣流動性。

「不日新者必日退」。在鞏固既有優勢同時，我們也要全力發展新增長點，主動求進求變，適應新形勢、新挑戰。其中，我們會加速建立國際黃金交易市場，拓展黃金倉儲，建造區域黃金儲備樞紐。我們也會建立香港黃金中央清算系統，為國際標準黃金交易提供高效可信的清算服務。

香港一直積極發揮「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台作用，我們會強化香港的出海平台優勢，攜手更多內地企業創造商機。特區政府已成立內地企業出海專班，匯聚各界專業人士的力量，為內地企業提供全方位支援，讓更多內地企業以香港作為跳板，走向世界。

我們會研究優化稅務寬減措施，吸引更多內地企業在香港設立財資中心，同時推動銀行業，尤其是內地銀行在香港設立區域總部，用香港的專業服務，開拓東南亞和中東等新興地區市場。

在綠色可持續金融發展方面，去年在香港安排發行的綠色和可持續債券總額約430億美元，佔亞洲區總額約百分之四十五，連續七年位居亞洲區市場的首位。

香港交易所也會加強與大灣區碳市場的試點合作，試驗跨境交易結算路徑，共建區內碳市場生態圈。我們將繼續善用香港深廣的資本市場，為區域可持續發展作出貢獻。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，香港作為國際金融中心，會繼續全力發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，改革創新，自強不息，為國家高質量發展作出更大貢獻。

最後，我再次恭賀2025金融街論壇年會圓滿成功，祝願在座各位工作順利，事業蒸蒸日上。謝謝大家。"

Addressing the ceremony, the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, said that since the launch of the national security comics, Andy and Security Bear, these two main characters have been well received. The Andy & Bear KinderFest was therefore established to organise workshops in kindergartens. Accompanied by volunteers from the Security Bureau Youth Uniformed Group Leaders Forum, the two adorable main characters will visit kindergartens to interact with students. Through storytelling and games, the workshops aim to teach young children basic concepts of national security in a fun and engaging environment, helping them understand the importance of safeguarding the homeland.

During the ceremony, Mr Tang and the other officiating guest, the Under Secretary for Education, Dr Sze Chun-fai, appointed some 90 members of the Leaders Forum as leaders of the Andy & Bear KinderFest and witnessed 30 representatives pledging to take on the mission of national security promotion and education by disseminating national security messages to schools.

商經局局長在韓國慶州出席亞太經合組織部長級會議（附圖）,2025-10-30 17:00,2025-10-30 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000537.htm,"商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺今日（十月三十日）在韓國慶州出席第三十六屆亞太區經濟合作組織（亞太經合組織）部長級會議。

今年亞太經合組織的主題為「我們構築的可持續明天」。丘應樺在題為「創新與繁榮」的討論環節上，與其他部長分享香港致力推動數字化以促進人民及未來世代繁榮發展。

丘應樺表示，數字技術，特別是人工智能的急速發展，正以前所未有的速度從根本改變社會。為充分利用其效益並順利轉型，香港堅定支持深化亞太經合組織的數字合作，以促進經濟增長和應對共同挑戰。

他指出，加強基建和採用應用導向策略，對促進人工智能深度融入各行業十分重要。就此，香港一直採取實際行動，包括增建高性能數據園區，以先進算力推動創新；通過加快中、小及微型企業數字轉型以促進人工智能的應用；以及運用人工智能提升香港的貿易架構等。

丘應樺續說，香港採取以人為本的方式，應對數字鴻溝和工種轉移等窒礙包容數字轉型的主要挑戰。除了將人工智能素養納入學校核心課程和加強教師培訓外，香港亦正改革再培訓計劃，並加強對現有勞動力的再就業支援。

在另一場題為「連接」的討論環節上，丘應樺重申，在應對日益複雜的局勢時，以世界貿易組織（世貿組織）為基礎的多邊貿易制度繼續發揮關鍵作用。

他強調：「世貿組織秉持不歧視和協作的核心原則，加上其各種重要的角色和功能，在過去數十年引領全球貿易蓬勃發展。在這前所未有的嚴峻時期，我們相信開放、穩定、透明、包容、可預測和以規則為本的國際貿易環境較以往任何時候都更為重要，特別是對發展中經濟體而言，不但能助它們生存，更可讓它們乘着新興機遇蓬勃發展。」

丘應樺表示，亞太經合組織本身亦積極應對影響亞太區的議題，包括加強供應鏈的韌性以抵禦衝擊和威脅。作為外向型經濟體，無縫且有效的供應鏈對香港至關重要。

他續指，香港在這方面善用技術創新，例如應用人工智能以便利海關執法、貨物清關和航空合作夥伴配對。香港亦正積極與東南亞國家聯盟等主要貿易夥伴的貿易單一窗口建立連接。

在部長級會議期間，丘應樺分別與國家商務部副部長兼國際貿易談判副代表凌激、韓國產業通商資源部通商事務次官補樸鍾元、秘魯外貿和旅遊部長Teresa Stella Mera Gómez、新西蘭貿易及投資部長Todd McClay和印尼貿易部部長Budi Santoso會面，就雙方關注的議題交換意見。

丘應樺明日（十月三十一日）返港。"

"SCED attends APEC Ministerial Meeting in Gyeongju, Korea (with photos)",2025-10-30 17:00,2025-10-30 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000538.htm," The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, today (October 30) attended the 36th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministerial Meeting in Gyeongju, Korea.

 The theme for APEC this year is ""Building a Sustainable Tomorrow"". At a discussion session entitled ""Innovate and Prosper"", Mr Yau shared with other ministers Hong Kong's efforts to promote digitalisation for the prosperity of people and future generations.

 Mr Yau said that the rapid development of digital technologies, particularly AI, is fundamentally changing societies at an unprecedented pace. To fully harness the benefits and smoothen the transformation process, Hong Kong strongly supports deepening APEC's digital co-operation to foster economic growth and address common challenges.

 He highlighted the importance of strengthening infrastructure and adopting an application-oriented approach to promote deep integration of AI across the economy. To this end, Hong Kong has been taking concrete actions, such as developing an additional high-performing data facility cluster to provide advanced computing power for innovation, promoting AI adoption by accelerating the digital transformation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and upgrading Hong Kong's trade architecture with AI.

 Mr Yau added that with a people-centred approach, Hong Kong is tackling key challenges such as digital divides and job displacement that are impeding an inclusive digital transition. Apart from incorporating AI literacy into schools' core curriculums and enhancing teacher training, Hong Kong is also reforming retraining programmes and strengthening re-employment support for the current workforce.

 Speaking at another session entitled ""Connect"", Mr Yau stressed that in navigating the increasingly complex landscape, the multilateral trading system underpinned by the World Trade Organization (WTO) continues to play a pivotal role.

 ""The WTO, with its core principles of non-discrimination and co-operation as well as various critical roles and functions, has led world trade to flourish for decades. In these unprecedented and challenging times, we believe that an open, stable, transparent, inclusive and predictable rules-based international trading environment is more crucial than ever, particularly for less developed economies, enabling them not just to survive but also to thrive on emerging opportunities,"" he stressed.

 Mr Yau said that APEC itself has also been active in addressing issues that affect the region, such as enhancing the resilience of supply chains against shocks and threats. Being an externally oriented economy, seamless and effective supply chains are essential to Hong Kong.

 He added that Hong Kong has leveraged technological innovations in this context, such as the application of AI to facilitate customs enforcement, cargo clearance and matching for airline partnerships. Hong Kong is also actively building connectivity on trade single window with key trading partners such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

 On the sidelines of the meeting, Mr Yau separately met with the Vice Minister and Deputy China International Trade Representative of the Ministry of Commerce, Mr Ling Ji; the Deputy Minister for Trade of Korea, Mr Park Jong-won; the Minister of Foreign Trade and Tourism of Peru, Ms Teresa Stella Mera Gómez; the Minister for Trade and Investment of New Zealand, Mr Todd McClay; and the Minister of Trade of Indonesia, Mr Budi Santoso, to exchange views on issues of mutual concern.

 Mr Yau will return to Hong Kong tomorrow (October 31)."

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on October 28 to noon today (October 30), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 230 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 100 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

大家好。今日我很高興能夠參與港台「十五運會、殘特奧會」啟動禮。今屆全運會香港賽區第一個競賽項目沙灘排球，將率先於明日在維多利亞公園展開。今日正好能夠與大家一起倒數，迎接全城熱切期待的全運會，為香港健兒打氣。

今屆全運會意義非凡，是首次由廣東、香港、澳門三地共同舉辦，不但是粵港澳大灣區合作與融合的一個重要里程碑，更是突破邊界的創新實踐。以十一月八日的跨境公路單車賽為例，全國健兒將會穿越香港、珠海、澳門三地比拼，除了體現香港統籌賽事與跨境協作的能力，也展示大灣區一小時生活圈的互聯互通優勢，推動大灣區體育產業聯動發展。

香港在今屆全運會承辦八個競賽項目，不但為我們帶來寶貴的大型賽事經驗，更有利香港健兒把握主場之利衝擊獎牌，鞏固本港的體育發展。此外，全運會為全國最高水平的運動會，除了吸引大批旅客前來香港欣賞賽事，亦帶動香港市民在觀賞賽事之餘外出消費，有助帶旺場館周邊地區的餐飲、零售等。我們期望透過今次機會，展現香港多元化的城市形象，宣傳香港盛事之都的品牌，讓舉國及世界看到香港的活力與魅力。

為讓香港市民能全方位觀賞賽事感受全運會氣氛，繼去年圓滿直擊巴黎奧運會及殘奧會賽事之後，港台已做好準備，直播國家級體育盛事。我知道港台同事早在一年多前已經展開全方位的策劃，無論是賽前專題、運動員備戰，還是轉播技術與新媒體內容等等都做足準備。

全運會期間，港台電視32及港台電視36將會廣泛播放不同賽事，而為了推動共融全運，港台的全運會賽事直播將提供粵語、普通話旁述、口述影像及手語服務，務求讓每一位香港市民能切身感受國家體育盛事及運動魅力。我深信港台團隊將發揮一貫的專業精神和高水準製作，向大眾宣揚國家高水平的競技運動。

我亦藉此為香港運動員打氣，祝願他們再創佳績，亦預祝十五運會、殘特奧會圓滿成功！最後，大家記得除了支持全運會和香港運動員之餘，亦要記得十二月七日立法會選舉的大日子，積極履行公民責任投下你手中重要的一票。大家亦可鼓勵你的家人和朋友踴躍投票，選出為香港繁榮穩定作出貢獻的立法會議員。十二月七日，投入選舉，共創未來！多謝各位。"
Speech by SJ at High-Level Forum on Generative AI Governance and Cultural Co-Creation (English only),2025-10-30 16:42,2025-10-30 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000608.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the High-Level Forum on Generative AI (Gen AI) Governance and Cultural Co-Creation today (October 30):

Provost Professor Guo (Provost of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Professor Guo Yike), Professor Song (Director, Media Intelligence Research Center of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Professor Celine Song), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, 

 A very good afternoon. It is a great pleasure to address this assembly of distinguished scholars and industry leaders and kick off the panel discussion on ""Credibility and Accountability in the Era of Generative AI"".

 The choice of topic is most timely as the Chief Executive just announced last month in this year's Policy Address that the Department of Justice will form an interdepartmental working group to co-ordinate the responsible bureaux to review the legislation needed to complement the wider application of artificial intelligence. This raises an important question: why is there an imminent need for such a review of legislation?

 While providing convenience and enhancing efficiency, AI, as we all know, is also open to abuse and sometimes, even with the best of intentions, may be misused. Here comes the question of credibility and accountability.

 Currently, Hong Kong has no bespoke legislation governing AI. To harness the potential benefits this new technology may bring, it is incumbent upon the Government to take the lead in reviewing the relevant law so as to provide a facilitative yet properly controlled legal environment for AI's development. This is not easy as it requires us to strike a balance, even if it is going to be a fine balance, between the need to encourage and promote innovation and technology development on the one hand, and that to ensure credibility and accountability in the use of AI on the other hand. This balancing exercise is highly relevant to the rule of law. Let me explain why.

 There are many attempts to identify and articulate what should be regarded as the core or fundamental principles of the rule of law. This is how I would encapsulate the concept: there must be the existence of laws and regulations which can be enforced effectively to govern human activities so as to ensure that such activities will be conducted in a fair and proper manner, without causing any harm to or prejudicing the rights of others. To uphold this principle, it is essential for our legal framework to evolve in a timely manner to protect the legitimate rights and interests of different stakeholders affected by the use of AI.

 I now wish to underscore five issues which are non-exhaustive concerning the credibility and accountability in relation to the use of AI.

 First, AI-generated content depends on the dataset on which the AI tool is trained and the information uploaded to it to obtain a response. A reliable dataset and machine learning may involve the use of copyrighted materials. This raises questions on whether the current copyright law can tackle new issues involving the relative rights and liabilities among copyright owners, generative AI providers and its users, such as the use of copyrighted materials without authorisation and ownership of AI-generated work.

 Second, as the saying goes, ""Garbage in, garbage out."" Sometimes, AI may generate false or inaccurate content due to the incomplete or flawed information uploaded. Recently, the High Court of England and Wales has also warned that GenAI can produce apparently coherent and plausible but in fact entirely incorrect responses to prompts, make confident but untrue assertions, cite sources that do not exist.

 Third, deepfakes generated by AI may present substantial risks by producing highly realistic but in fact fake audio and visual content. The complaint against a law student using AI to create over 700 pornographic female images is telling. The implication is that, among other things, in any process of evidence-based inquiries, what appears to be very compelling may in fact be fabricated.

 Fourth, Professor Cecilia Chan, an education academic, has recently said that the rapid advancement of GenAI presents a serious threat to higher education, particularly with the emergence of the so-called ""AI-giarism"", i.e. the misuse of AI tools by students and researchers to present AI-generated work as their own. In the long run, it may risk eroding an individual's critical thinking skills in reasoning through the questioning of assumptions and the evaluation of information before reaching independent judgement.

 Fifth, UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) expresses concern that AI may pose risks to children as it can instantly create persuasive disinformation, as well as harmful and illegal content. AI may also influence children's perceptions and attributions of intelligence, cognitive development, and social behaviour as it blurs the line between animate and inanimate, given the human-like tone of chatbots. Even for mature and seasoned decision-makers, reliance on AI may risk systemic discrimination which reinforces existing biases or even amplify inequalities, prejudices and stereotyping.

 The Government has already been putting in much effort to tackle these issues. On the intellectual property front, the Government is introducing, among other things, a new ""text and data mining exception"" in the Copyright Ordinance (Cap 528), which would allow copyright users to make copies of copyright works for computational data analysis and processing, without a licence from copyright owners.

 We also see over time the issuance of guidelines from different quarters. Examples include ""Guidelines on the Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Judges and Judicial Officers and Support Staff of the Hong Kong Judiciary"", ""Hong Kong Generative Artificial Intelligence Technical and Application Guideline"" issued by the Government's Digital Policy Office and those from local universities.

 While these guidelines are flexible and sector-specific, they do not have the force of law. Whether they are sufficient and effective to address the above-mentioned issues is yet to be seen and requires further study. In any event, proper co-ordination and overall supervision may well be required to prevent and reconcile possible inconsistent or even conflicting measures on the same or similar issues.

What is happening elsewhere?

  On the Chinese Mainland, the ""Interim Measures for the Administration of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services"", jointly issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China and other authorities, took effect in August 2023. GenAI service providers must now, for example, take effective measures to make GenAI services more transparent and AI-generated content more accurate and reliable, protect users' inputted information and use records, and label AI-generated content. Service providers will be punished by the supervising authorities for violation after inspection. Under a departmental regulatory document effective in September 2025, service providers who provide text generation or editing services conducted through simulation of natural persons, etc, shall add explicit labels to AI-generated or synthesised content.

 The European Artificial Intelligence Act, binding and directly applicable in all EU (European Union) member states, commenced in August 2024, with its requirements applying incrementally. Certain requirements on credibility and accountability will start on August 2 next year and providers of GenAI systems shall ensure that systems' outputs are marked in a machine-readable format and detectable as AI-generated or manipulated. Subject to some exceptions, deployers of an AI system that generates or manipulates content constituting a deepfake, shall disclose that the content has been artificially generated or manipulated.

 Most recently, in Italy, Law No. 132/2025 just took effect on October 10, 2025. This is the first domestic law in the European Union on the use of AI. The fundamental principles underpinning the legal framework governing the use of AI in different sectors, including healthcare, employment, professional services, and intellectual property, are transparency, proportionality, security, protection of data, accountability, gender equality and non-discrimination. That Law also seeks to combat crimes committed with AI support. The unlawful dissemination of AI-generated or altered content e.g. deepfake is a standalone offence, whereas market manipulation offences committed through AI are subject to increased penalties. To protect minors, children under the age of 14 may use AI only with their parents' consent.

 For us, Hong Kong must of course design its own approach based on its own circumstances. This requires collective wisdom from all sectors. With this in mind, the Government will engage with all relevant stakeholders to build a legal framework to promote AI in a way which is reasonably flexible to cater for its fast development and wide application, but without compromising the rule of law.

 That's why as I have mentioned over lunch during my discussion with Professor Song, I am very excited at the establishment of the new centre. One of the focuses of the centre concerns AI governance and I certainly look forward to more collaborations between the Department of Justice, or perhaps the HKSAR Government as a whole, and the centre and, of course, the university. Indeed, more stakeholders will share common interest in this very important area.

 Before I conclude, I would like to take the opportunity to mention another very important thing. I would like to invite you to exercise your right to vote in the upcoming Legislative Council General Election on December 7. Your active participation is not merely an exercise of an extremely valuable and important constitutional right. Your active participation will also make a very impactful decision on the future well-being of our society. On this note, I wish you a fruitful, meaningful and enjoyable discussion and exchanges this afternoon.

 Thank you very much."

Secretary for Health chairs 16th meeting of Steering Committee on Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (with photos),2025-10-30 16:30,2025-10-30 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000584.htm,"The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, chaired the 16th meeting of the Steering Committee on Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) today (October 30) to discuss the strategies and measures for tackling NCDs.

Professor Lo said, ""Like many other countries and regions, Hong Kong is confronted with the threats arising from an ageing population and NCDs. In 2024, over half (53 per cent) of all registered deaths in Hong Kong were caused by NCDs, including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and chronic respiratory diseases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 80 per cent of all premature NCD deaths can be prevented through management of risk factors and adherence to a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, prevention as well as early detection and proper treatment are the most cost-effective long-term strategies in reducing the burden of NCDs.""

During the meeting, members examined the progress of the nine local targets in the prevention and control of NCDs. Professor Lo emphasised, ""Through the collaborative efforts of various parties, the risk of premature mortality from four major NCDs in Hong Kong has declined continuously, with a reduction of over 25 per cent when compared to 15 years ago, indicating that we have achieved certain results in this regard. Also, the smoking prevalence rate in Hong Kong has reduced significantly from 23.3 per cent in 1982 to a historical low of 9.1 per cent in 2023. However, other risk factors for developing NCDs like obesity and insufficient physical activity are still common. As such, the Chief Executive announced in his 2024 and 2025 Policy Address respectively that the Government would devise health promotion strategies by adopting a life-course framework and weight management action plan, with a view to raising public health awareness and practices through strengthening health education and promotion, cultivating a supportive environment in the community, strengthening health service delivery, and more.""

The Department of Health (DH) has set up a task force to devise health promotion strategies by adopting a life-course framework. During the meeting, the task force briefed members on the latest local epidemiological data and scientific evidence, as well as priority areas and necessary health promotion measures for different age groups formulated by making reference to the WHO's latest recommendations and using an evidence-based approach, covering various stages including infancy, entering school, adulthood, employment, as well as pre- and post-pregnancy, and transition to older age. Furthermore, within the context of health and medical innovation development, the strategies also include the use of innovative technologies to enhance public health in a comprehensive, systematic, and efficient manner.

The Government has been actively establishing a prevention-oriented primary healthcare system according to the reform measures set out in the Primary Healthcare Blueprint. The Health Bureau (HHB) launched the three-year Chronic Disease Co-Care (CDCC) Pilot Scheme in 2023. Under a co-payment model, participants can receive hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidaemia screenings in the private healthcare sector for early treatment and long-term health management. According to the 2025 Policy Address, the HHB will gradually develop the CDCC Pilot Scheme into the CDCC Platform to integrate primary healthcare resources and gradually extend it to cover more types of chronic diseases. More health empowerment elements and preventive care programmes will also be added to establish a more systematic and coherent integrated primary healthcare platform in the community.

Members also received a briefing on the new phase of tobacco control measures in Hong Kong to further alleviate the threat posed by tobacco to public health through a multipronged tobacco control strategy, namely, Regulate Supply, Suppress Demand; Ban Promotion, Reduce Attractiveness; Expand No Smoking Areas, Mitigate Harm; and Enhance Education, Support Cessation. Smoking is the most important but preventable risk factor leading to death and disease. Members unanimously agreed with the Government's comprehensive tobacco control strategy, which aims to further reduce the smoking prevalence in Hong Kong and minimise the impact of secondhand smoke on citizens, thereby preventing the heavy price imposed on the whole society and the healthcare system by smoking-induced diseases.

To ensure effective surveillance of NCDs in Hong Kong to support the formulation of public health policies, the DH commenced the fourth territory-wide Population Health Survey (PHS) last month to collect pertinent information on the health status and lifestyles of the local population, with a view to updating and enriching the Government's database on population health. Findings from the PHS will facilitate the review of the various targets under the Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent and Control NCDs in Hong Kong."
一名入境旅客管有未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-10-30 16:05,2025-10-30 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000585.htm,"一名入境旅客因管有未完稅香煙和未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（十月三十日）在粉嶺裁判法院被判處監禁兩個月零十日及罰款二千元。

海關人員於十月二十四日在落馬洲支線管制站截查一名四十一歲抵港男旅客，並在其身上及個人行李內檢獲六百二十支未完稅香煙，估計市值約三千元，應課稅值約二千元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2025-10-30 16:05,2025-10-30 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000587.htm,"An incoming passenger was sentenced to two months and 10 days' imprisonment and fined $2,000 by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (October 30) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs Officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted a 41-year-old incoming male passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on October 24 and seized 620 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $3,000 and a duty potential of about $2,000 found on him and from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence imposes a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
​基層醫療署公布社區藥物名冊運作機制及推出《基層醫療社區藥房指引》　配合明年推出的社區藥房計劃（附圖）,2025-10-30 16:02,2025-10-30 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000222.htm,"基層醫療署今日（十月三十日）公布社區藥物名冊的運作機制，及推出《基層醫療社區藥房指引》，為社區藥房及其藥劑師服務準則建立清晰框架，以配合預計明年第四季起推行的社區藥房計劃，讓市民更便捷地獲得可負擔的基層醫療藥物及專業社區藥房服務。

《基層醫療健康藍圖》建議加強社區藥房角色，及發展社區藥房服務。二○二四年《施政報告》公布制訂社區藥物名冊及推出社區藥房計劃。有關政策包括制訂相關基層醫療社區藥房服務準則，以為社區藥房計劃定下參考要求。

社區藥物名冊運作機制

按照社區藥物名冊的運作機制，名冊所列藥物將主要從醫院管理局（醫管局）藥物名冊中選取，並透過政府與醫管局所建立的協作機制，由醫管局統籌採購。有關機制利用醫管局完善的藥物評估及入藥機制、嚴謹的採購標準和龐大的採購規模，不但可確保社區藥物名冊的藥物均屬安全、具療效及質量保證，更可通過共同採購降低成本。

社區藥物名冊將涵蓋基層醫療常用藥物，包括預防性藥物、慢性疾病管理藥物（如糖尿病及高血壓藥物）及治療偶發性疾病所需藥物。名冊設有三個層級類別，各層級藥物的納入機制、使用範圍及共付模式將有所不同。第一層以非專利藥物為主，第二層涵蓋個別專利藥物及指定藥物類別，第三層則為特別藥物類別。

社區藥物名冊的藥物應用將於明年下半年有序推行，屆時參與政府基層醫療健康計劃（如「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」））的市民，可透過計劃內的醫生（家庭醫生）或參與社區藥房計劃的社區藥房，根據醫生處方，按共付模式獲配發名冊內的基層醫療藥物。

基層醫療署現正建立社區藥物名冊的藥物名單，並經醫管局與藥物供應商確立採購協議和相關資訊系統的籌備工作。名冊推出初期，將以｢慢病共治計劃｣的藥物名單為基礎，涵蓋超過100項藥物，並會根據病人的需要逐步擴展，長遠可望涵蓋多達200至400項藥物。政府會不時審視名冊的藥物名單，為未來納入新藥預留彈性，以配合社會需要。

《基層醫療社區藥房指引》

為配合將推行的社區藥房計劃，基層醫療署推出《基層醫療社區藥房指引》，制訂清晰的標準，並建立服務框架，推動社區藥房及其藥劑師在醫療體系中發揮更關鍵的角色，提升專業水平及服務質素，確保市民能夠獲得一致、優質和安全的護理服務。

《指引》涵蓋社區藥房四大範疇：（一）運作及管理人員標準；（二）處所要求；（三）日常運作程序，以及（四）服務範疇，系統性地說明社區藥房在現行法例和監管框架下的營運模式及提供服務的實務準則。《指引》附錄載有評估核對表，讓社區藥房檢視其營運，以推動服務質素的持續改善。

《指引》會作為社區藥房計劃的標準基礎。長遠而言，經政府審核符合《指引》訂明的服務標準及品質保證要求的註冊藥房，方可成為基層醫療服務網絡下之認可社區藥房。《指引》會率先於地區康健中心網絡的社區藥房服務點執行。基層醫療署將密切留意基層醫療及社區藥房發展的需要，持續與社區藥房工作小組、社區藥房諮詢小組及指引制定工作小組保持緊密溝通，並會定期更新《指引》內容供業界參考。

社區藥物名冊的運作機制及《指引》全文，請參閱基層醫療署網站。

社區藥房計劃

基層醫療署將於明年第四季起分階段推行社區藥房計劃。計劃設有「社區」及「院舍」兩種服務模式。在社區藥房計劃（社區），符合參與藥物重配服務的醫管局家庭醫學門診病人在下次覆診前，會由參與計劃的社區藥房分期配發指定藥物，以加強病人準確用藥，避免貯存過量藥物，從而減低風險和可能造成的浪費。而參與基層醫療健康計劃，例如「慢病共治計劃」的病人，亦可選擇在社區藥房計劃內的社區藥房領取藥物，為病人提供除家庭醫生診所外另一便捷取藥途徑及用藥指導服務。

社區藥房計劃（院舍）則為居住在安老及殘疾院舍的醫管局病人定期配發醫管局處方藥物，改善目前院舍由職員每日整理及分發藥物的情況，以加強病人準確用藥及減低過量貯存藥物的風險。社區藥房計劃（院舍）服務內容涵蓋藥物配發、整合及預先包裝每日所需藥物。此外，藥劑師亦會協助院舍運用資訊科技進行藥物管理，以提升院舍用藥的安全性。

參與計劃的社區藥房亦會按病人或院舍的實際需要，提供多項專業藥劑增值服務。除一般藥物諮詢和輔導、藥物整合、藥物安全信息外，社區藥房計劃（社區）的藥房可提供藥物管理、慢性疾病管理、戒煙及推廣口腔健康；社區藥房計劃（院舍）則包括建立藥物派發系統、院舍藥物管理及庫存、健康教育及員工培訓等增值服務，確保派藥安全準確及加強院舍的藥物安全管理。

首階段社區藥房計劃（社區）將於今年第四季進行招標，並於明年第四季起分階段推行。計劃初期將在四個地區試行，每區設立約四至五間社區藥房，並會於二○二七年第四季擴展至全港十八區。至於社區藥房計劃（院舍）則預計於明年第一季進行首階段招標，並於二○二七年第一季起開始分階段推行。"
Primary Healthcare Commission announces Community Drug Formulary mechanism and Guidelines of Practice for Community Pharmacy to pave way for launch of Community Pharmacy Programme next year (with photo),2025-10-30 16:02,2025-10-30 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000223.htm,"The Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) announced the Community Drug Formulary (CDF) mechanism and promulgated the Guidelines of Practice for Community Pharmacy (Guidelines) today (October 30) to establish a clear framework for the services of community pharmacies and their pharmacists, with a view to paving the way for the launch of the Community Pharmacy Programme (CPP). The CPP is expected to be launched in the fourth quarter of next year, offering more convenience for citizens to obtain affordable primary healthcare drugs and professional community pharmacy services.

The Primary Healthcare Blueprint recommended to enhance the role of community pharmacies and to develop community pharmacy services. The 2024 Policy Address announced the development of a CDF and the launch of a CPP, including the formulation of relevant practice guidelines for community pharmacies in primary healthcare, setting reference requirements for the CPP.

Community Drug Formulary mechanism

According to the mechanism of the CDF, drugs listed therein will be mainly selected from the Hospital Authority (HA) Drug Formulary. The HA will co-ordinate the procurement through a collaborative mechanism established between the Government and the HA. Leveraging the HA's comprehensive drug assessment and inclusion mechanism, stringent procurement standards and large-scale procurements, the relevant mechanism not only can ensure that all drugs listed in the CDF are safe, efficacious and of quality, but also can achieve cost reductions through joint procurement.

The CDF will cover drugs commonly used in primary healthcare, including preventive drugs, drugs for managing chronic diseases (such as drugs for diabetes and hypertension), and drugs for treating episodic illnesses. The CDF will be classified into three tiers, each with different drug inclusion mechanisms, scope of applications, as well as co-payment models. Tier 1 will mainly comprise non-patented drugs; Tier 2 will cover individual patented drugs and specified drugs; and Tier 3 will consist of drugs classified as special category.

The drug application of the CDF will be launched in the second half of next year in an orderly manner. By then, citizens participating in the Government's primary healthcare programmes, such as the Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme (CDCC Pilot Scheme), can be provided with primary healthcare drugs listed in the CDF with doctors' prescriptions under a co-payment model through doctors under the programmes (family doctors) or community pharmacies participating in the CPP.

The PHC Commission is currently formulating the CDF drug list, and establishing procurement agreements with drug suppliers and pressing ahead with the preparatory work of relevant information systems through the HA. The CDF will be based on the drug list of the CDCC Pilot Scheme and cover over 100 drug items upon its launch. It will be gradually expanded based on patient needs, with the long-term scope of covering up to 200 to 400 drug items. The Government will review the drug list in a timely manner and allow flexibility to include new drugs in the future to meet the needs of the society.

Guidelines of Practice for Community Pharmacy

To pave way for the upcoming CPP, the PHC Commission promulgated the Guidelines to devise clear standards and to establish a service framework, with a view to promoting community pharmacies and their pharmacists to play a more crucial role in the healthcare system, enhancing professional standards and service quality, and ensuring members of the public can receive consistent, high-quality and safe care services.

The Guidelines cover four key areas of community pharmacies: (1) standards for management and staff involved in the operation; (2) requirements for the premises; (3) daily operation procedures; and (4) scope of services. The Guidelines stipulate the operation models and practical guidance of service provisions of a community pharmacy under the existing legal and regulatory framework in a systemic manner. The appendix of the Guidelines includes an assessment checklist for community pharmacies to review their operations, thereby promoting continuous improvement in service quality.

The Guidelines will serve as the fundamental standard for the CPP. In the long term, only registered pharmacies that have been vetted by the Government as meeting the service standards and quality assurance requirements outlined in the Guidelines will be recognised as community pharmacies under the primary healthcare service network. The Guidelines will initially apply to community pharmacies participating as service outlets in the District Health Centre network. The PHC Commission will closely monitor the needs for the development of primary healthcare and community pharmacies, maintaining close communication with the Working Group on Community Pharmacy, the Advisory Group on Community Pharmacy and the Task Group on Guideline Formulation, and regularly update the content of the Guidelines for industry reference.

For the Community Drug Formulary mechanism and the full text of the Guidelines, please refer to the PHC Commission website.

Community Pharmacy Programme

The PHC Commission will launch the CPP in phases starting from the fourth quarter of next year. The CPP will adopt two service models, namely the Community and the Residential Care Homes (RCH). Under the CPP (Community), participating community pharmacies will dispense designated drugs in batches to patients of the HA's Family Medicine Out-patient Services eligible for drug dispensing services before their next follow-up consultation with a view to enhancing patients' drug compliance and avoiding excess storage of drugs, thereby reducing risks and potential wastage. As for patients enrolled in primary healthcare programmes, such as the CDCC Pilot Scheme, they may also opt to obtain drugs from community pharmacies under the CPP, offering them a convenient alternative for obtaining drugs and medication counselling services other than their family doctors' clinics.

Under the CPP (RCH), HA-prescribed drugs will be regularly dispensed to HA patients residing in RCHs for the elderly and persons with disabilities to improve the current practice of daily drug sorting and distribution by RCH staff, with a view to enhancing patients' drug compliance and reducing the risks associated with overstocking of drugs. The services of the CPP (RCH) include drug distribution, reconciling, and prepackaging of the daily required drugs. In addition, pharmacists will assist RCHs in adopting information technology for drug management to enhance drug safety in RCHs.

Pharmacies participating in the CPP will also provide a range of professional value-added pharmaceutical services according to the actual needs of patients and RCHs. Apart from general drug consultations and counselling, drug reconciliation and drug safety information, pharmacies under the CPP (Community) also provide services such as drug management, chronic disease management, smoking cessation and oral health promotions. As for the CPP (RCH), value-added services include establishment of drug administration systems, drug management and storage for RCHs, health education and staff training, thereby ensuring safe and accurate drug administration, as well as enhancing management of drug safety in RCHs.

The first-stage tender exercise for the CPP (Community) will commence in the fourth quarter of this year, with phased implementation starting from the fourth quarter of next year. In the initial phase, the CPP (Community) will be piloted at four districts, each with approximately four to five community pharmacies, and will be extended to cover all 18 districts across the city by the fourth quarter of 2027. Meanwhile, the first-stage tender exercise for the CPP (RCH) is expected to commence in the first quarter of next year, with phased implementation beginning in the first quarter of 2027."
​基層醫療署公布社區藥物名冊運作機制及推出《基層醫療社區藥房指引》　配合明年推出的社區藥房計劃,2025-10-30 16:02,2025-10-30 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000222.htm,"    基層醫療署今日（十月三十日）公布社區藥物名冊的運作機制，及推出《基層醫療社區藥房指引》，為社區藥房及其藥劑師服務準則建立清晰框架，以配合預計明年第四季起推行的社區藥房計劃，讓市民更便捷地獲得可負擔的基層醫療藥物及專業社區藥房服務。

《基層醫療健康藍圖》建議加強社區藥房角色，及發展社區藥房服務。二○二四年《施政報告》公布制訂社區藥物名冊及推出社區藥房計劃。有關政策包括制訂相關基層醫療社區藥房服務準則，以為社區藥房計劃定下參考要求。

社區藥物名冊運作機制

按照社區藥物名冊的運作機制，名冊所列藥物將主要從醫院管理局（醫管局）藥物名冊中選取，並透過政府與醫管局所建立的協作機制，由醫管局統籌採購。有關機制利用醫管局完善的藥物評估及入藥機制、嚴謹的採購標準和龐大的採購規模，不但可確保社區藥物名冊的藥物均屬安全、具療效及質量保證，更可通過共同採購降低成本。

社區藥物名冊將涵蓋基層醫療常用藥物，包括預防性藥物、慢性疾病管理藥物（如糖尿病及高血壓藥物）及治療偶發性疾病所需藥物。名冊設有三個層級類別，各層級藥物的納入機制、使用範圍及共付模式將有所不同。第一層以非專利藥物為主，第二層涵蓋個別專利藥物及指定藥物類別，第三層則為特別藥物類別。

社區藥物名冊的藥物應用將於明年下半年有序推行，屆時參與政府基層醫療健康計劃（如「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」））的市民，可透過計劃內的醫生（家庭醫生）或參與社區藥房計劃的社區藥房，根據醫生處方，按共付模式獲配發名冊內的基層醫療藥物。

基層醫療署現正建立社區藥物名冊的藥物名單，並經醫管局與藥物供應商確立採購協議和相關資訊系統的籌備工作。名冊推出初期，將以｢慢病共治計劃｣的藥物名單為基礎，涵蓋超過100項藥物，並會根據病人的需要逐步擴展，長遠可望涵蓋多達200至400項藥物。政府會不時審視名冊的藥物名單，為未來納入新藥預留彈性，以配合社會需要。

《基層醫療社區藥房指引》

為配合將推行的社區藥房計劃，基層醫療署推出《基層醫療社區藥房指引》，制訂清晰的標準，並建立服務框架，推動社區藥房及其藥劑師在醫療體系中發揮更關鍵的角色，提升專業水平及服務質素，確保市民能夠獲得一致、優質和安全的護理服務。

《指引》涵蓋社區藥房四大範疇：（一）運作及管理人員標準；（二）處所要求；（三）日常運作程序，以及（四）服務範疇，系統性地說明社區藥房在現行法例和監管框架下的營運模式及提供服務的實務準則。《指引》附錄載有評估核對表，讓社區藥房檢視其營運，以推動服務質素的持續改善。

《指引》會作為社區藥房計劃的標準基礎。長遠而言，經政府審核符合《指引》訂明的服務標準及品質保證要求的註冊藥房，方可成為基層醫療服務網絡下之認可社區藥房。《指引》會率先於地區康健中心網絡的社區藥房服務點執行。基層醫療署將密切留意基層醫療及社區藥房發展的需要，持續與社區藥房工作小組、社區藥房諮詢小組及指引制定工作小組保持緊密溝通，並會定期更新《指引》內容供業界參考。

社區藥物名冊的運作機制及《指引》全文，請參閱基層醫療署網站。

社區藥房計劃

基層醫療署將於明年第四季起分階段推行社區藥房計劃。計劃設有「社區」及「院舍」兩種服務模式。在社區藥房計劃（社區），符合參與藥物重配服務的醫管局家庭醫學門診病人在下次覆診前，會由參與計劃的社區藥房分期配發指定藥物，以加強病人準確用藥，避免貯存過量藥物，從而減低風險和可能造成的浪費。而參與基層醫療健康計劃，例如「慢病共治計劃」的病人，亦可選擇在社區藥房計劃內的社區藥房領取藥物，為病人提供除家庭醫生診所外另一便捷取藥途徑及用藥指導服務。

社區藥房計劃（院舍）則為居住在安老及殘疾院舍的醫管局病人定期配發醫管局處方藥物，改善目前院舍由職員每日整理及分發藥物的情況，以加強病人準確用藥及減低過量貯存藥物的風險。社區藥房計劃（院舍）服務內容涵蓋藥物配發、整合及預先包裝每日所需藥物。此外，藥劑師亦會協助院舍運用資訊科技進行藥物管理，以提升院舍用藥的安全性。

醫務衞生局局長主持防控非傳染病督導委員會第十六次會議（附圖）,2025-10-30 15:33,2025-10-30 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000260.htm,"醫務衞生局（醫衞局）局長盧寵茂教授今日（十月三十日）主持防控非傳染病督導委員會第十六次會議，討論應對非傳染病的策略及措施。

盧寵茂教授說︰「香港與許多其他國家和地區一樣，正面對人口高齡化和非傳染病日益嚴重所帶來的威脅。在二○二四年，本港登記死亡病因超過一半（53%）屬非傳染病，包括癌症、心血管疾病、糖尿病和慢性呼吸系統疾病。世界衞生組織（世衞）指出，八成因非傳染病引致的早逝個案可透過控制風險因素及實踐健康生活習慣來預防。因此，預防、及早發現並妥善治療是減輕非傳染病負擔最具成本效益的長期策略。」

會議上，委員檢視了本地九項防控非傳染病目標的進度。盧寵茂教授強調︰「透過各方協作，本港因四大非傳染病而導致的早逝風險持續下降，與十五年前相比減少了超過25%，顯示我們在這方面已取得一定成效。此外，本港吸煙率亦由一九八二年的23.3%大幅下降至二○二三年9.1%的歷史新低。然而，引致非傳染病的其他風險因素如肥胖和缺乏體能活動仍然普遍。就此，行政長官在去年和今年的《施政報告》分別宣布，政府將制訂全生命周期健康促進策略和體重管理行動計劃，以透過加強健康教育推廣、營造有利的社會環境、強化醫療機構治療方案等措施來提升市民的健康意識和實踐。」

衞生署已成立專責小組制訂全生命周期健康促進策略。會議上，專責小組向委員闡述本地最新流行病學數據和科學證據，並參考世衞的最新建議，以實證為本的方式為各年齡層制訂優先領域和所需健康促進措施，涵蓋嬰兒期、入學、成年、就業，以及懷孕前後和步入老年的各個階段。此外，在醫療創新發展的脈絡下，該策略亦涵蓋運用創新科技，全面、系統化及有效地提升公眾健康。

政府正致力按照《基層醫療健康藍圖》所提出的改革措施，積極建立以預防為重的基層醫療體系。醫衞局於二○二三年推出為期三年的「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」），參加者在共付模式下，可在私營醫療界別接受高血壓、糖尿病和高血脂篩查，以及早接受治理及作長期的健康管理。根據二○二五年《施政報告》，醫衞局會逐步將「慢病共治計劃」發展成為「慢性疾病共同治理平台」，以整合基層醫療服務資源，逐步覆蓋更多慢性疾病，並加入更多健康賦能的元素和預防性護理項目，建立一個更有系統和連貫性的社區基層醫療綜合平台。

委員亦聽取有關本港新一階段控煙措施，務求通過多管齊下的控煙策略，包括「管供應、降需求」、「禁宣傳、減引誘」、「擴禁區、免煙害」及「重教育、助戒煙」，進一步減輕煙草對公眾健康的威脅。吸煙是導致死亡及疾病中最重要但可預防的風險因素。委員均認同政府採取的全面控煙策略，進一步降低本港吸煙率和減少二手煙對市民的影響，從而避免整體社會和醫療系統因吸煙而帶來的疾病付出沉重代價。

為有效監測非傳染病在本港的情況，以協助制訂公共衞生政策，衞生署於上月開展第四次全港人口健康調查，收集本地人口的健康狀況和生活習慣等資料，以更新和豐富政府的人口健康資料庫。調查結果將協助審視《香港非傳染病防控策略及行動計劃》訂立的各項目標。"

The inauguration was marked by a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by senior executives from MKS PAMP, representatives of InvestHK, and key stakeholders from the financial and precious metals sectors.
  
  MKS PAMP has maintained a substantial presence in Hong Kong for many years, with established offices and deep client relationships in the region. Building on this foundation, the inauguration of its new regional headquarters in the Central district represents an important expansion of the company's regional footprint. This strategic development elevates Hong Kong to the status of one of the company's three global trading hubs, alongside Geneva and New York. This provides seamless, round-the-clock coverage across all major time zones and assures the highest level of service to its regional clientele.
  
  Acting Director-General of Investment Promotion of InvestHK Ms Loretta Lee said, ""We are delighted to support MKS PAMP's expansion in Hong Kong. This decision not only reinforces the city's status as a leading international financial centre but also aligns with the Government's ongoing efforts to promote the city as an international hub for gold trading. MKS PAMP's expansion is a testament to Hong Kong's attractiveness as a destination for global businesses seeking to grow in the Asia-Pacific region.""
  
  The Chief Executive Officer of MKS PAMP, Mr James Emmett, said, ""Hong Kong's world-class infrastructure and established role as a global financial centre make it a natural choice for this expansion. We see Hong Kong not only as a vital link to the Chinese Mainland's gold market but also its position at the nexus of Asia Pacific's precious metals market.""
  
  He added, ""We value the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government's ongoing initiatives to strengthen its status as an international gold trading centre. This vision aligns seamlessly with our own, with Hong Kong consequently playing a strategic role in our regional and global aspirations.""
  
  He further explained, ""As part of its regional growth strategy, MKS PAMP is expanding its team in Hong Kong and across the Asia-Pacific region. The Hong Kong headquarters will serve as the regional hub for the company's comprehensive suite of precious metals trading and financial services. Core functions based here will include regional sales and client relationship management, precious metals trading, treasury activities, and operational support.""

商經局發言人表示，政府一直就「單一窗口」的發展與內地當局保持緊密聯繫，繼商經局今年五月與國家海關總署簽訂關於《「單一窗口」的合作安排》（《合作安排》），優化交流合作機制，是次專家小組會議重點討論兩地「單一窗口」的最新發展和落實進一步合作，並探討下階段深化合作的建議。

《行政長官2025年施政報告》提到，香港會與內地推進兩地「單一窗口」連接，探討將現行內地與香港貨物「一單兩報」安排擴展至其他貿易文件及運輸模式。就此，雙方在會上確定在香港「貿易單一窗口」第三階段推出後（即二○二六年年中開始）陸續擴展目前「一單兩報」的涵蓋範圍，在現時的道路預報貨物資料之外，新增道路貨物艙單和進出口報關單兩類貿易文件，讓更多業界受惠於道路貿易文件「一次錄入，雙向共用」的便利。

雙方亦探討在下一階段將「一單兩報」安排擴展至海運貿易文件的可行性，以省卻重新輸入數據的時間，進一步便利業界。

Government strives to take forward co-operation arrangements on Single Window connectivity with Mainland (with photos),2025-10-30 15:10,2025-10-30 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000383.htm," The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB) and the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department, together with the National Office of Port Administration, the Department of Commerce (Office of Port Administration) of Guangdong Province and other relevant Mainland authorities, convened the first meeting of the Mainland-Hong Kong Single Window Co-operation Expert Group in Zhuhai last Friday (October 24) to exchange experiences in developing the Single Windows and strengthen co-operation.

 A spokesman for the CEDB said that the Government has been maintaining close liaison with the Mainland authorities regarding the development of single windows. Further to the signing of the Cooperation Arrangement on Single Window between the CEDB and the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China in May this year to enhance the established exchange and co-operation mechanism, the Expert Group meeting focused on discussing the latest developments of the Single Windows of both sides and implementing further co-operation measures, while also exploring proposals for deepening collaboration in the next phase.

 As mentioned in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, Hong Kong will work with the Mainland to connect the Single Windows of the two places, and explore the feasibility of expanding the existing Mainland-Hong Kong cargoes ""Single Submission for Dual Declaration"" Scheme to cover other trade documents and transport modes. To this end, both sides confirmed at the meeting that the coverage of the Scheme will be extended progressively following the rollout of Hong Kong's Trade Single Window Phase 3 (starting from mid-2026), with road cargo manifests and import and export declarations to be covered in addition to the existing road advance cargo information, allowing more trade members to benefit from the convenience of completing customs declarations for both the Mainland and Hong Kong by making a single submission of road-mode trade documents.

 The two sides also explored the feasibility of expanding the Scheme to cover sea-mode trade documents in the next phase to reduce the time required for data re-entry, thereby further facilitating the trade.

 The spokesman added that the CEDB will continue to work closely with the Mainland authorities, including through regular Expert Group meetings, to take forward the interconnectivity of the Single Window systems of the two places."

The meeting brought together representatives from the Exit and Entry Administration of the People's Republic of China, the Macao Public Security Police Force, and the Macao Identification Services Bureau to exchange views on various immigration matters, including immigration management service arrangements for the 15th National Games of the People's Republic of China, travel document issuance, immigration clearance facilitation and talent mobility.

  Mr Kwok stated that the Immigration Department will strengthen collaboration with the Mainland and Macao counterparts to ensure the 15th National Games are held safely and smoothly. The Department will make advance immigration management service arrangements and deploy manpower as appropriate at control points to facilitate efficient immigration clearance for participating athletes, organisers and visitors travelling among the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao.

  The three sides agreed to continue close collaboration and deepen exchanges to safeguard national security and social stability and to support the successful hosting of the 15th National Games.

  At the meeting, the three authorities also discussed measures to further facilitate the travel of residents between the Mainland and the two Special Administrative Regions and to apply innovation and technology to enhance immigration services. Consensus was reached on various initiatives, including expanding the scope of talent endorsement policies, improving identification document processing and immigration clearance efficiency, and improving residency and service facilities arrangements. These aim to provide more convenient and efficient immigration services and to support Hong Kong and Macao in developing into international talent hubs.

  Since its launch in 2019 in Qingdao, Shandong Province, the ""1+2"" co-ordination mechanism has served as a key platform for co-operation in immigration management between the Mainland and the two Special Administrative Regions. Established under the leadership of the Exit and Entry Administration of the People's Republic of China with the participation from the Immigration Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Public Security Police Force and Identification Services Bureau of the Macao Special Administrative Region, the ""1+2"" co-ordination mechanism aims to enhance co-ordination and planning in immigration management across the three regions, facilitate smoother personnel exchanges, and better integrate Hong Kong and Macao into the national development strategy."

Thank you, Chair.

 I would like to first thank the Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for his insightful remarks.

  We gather at the time when the global trading landscape is undergoing profound transformation, driven by rapid technological advancements, escalating geopolitical tensions, rising protectionism, increasing fragmentation and other emerging issues like climate change. All these are reshaping the international trade order.

  In navigating this increasingly complex landscape, the multilateral trading system underpinned by the World Trade Organization (WTO) continues to play a pivotal role. The WTO, with its core principles of non-discrimination and co-operation as well as various critical roles and functions, has led the world trade to flourish for decades. In these unprecedented and challenging times, we believe that an open, stable, transparent, inclusive and predictable rules-based international trading environment is more crucial than ever, particularly for less developed economies, enabling them not just to survive but also to thrive on emerging opportunities.

 Notwithstanding the importance of the WTO, it is imperative that the WTO recalibrate its priorities and strategies to remain relevant. The WTO must update its rulebook, not only on substance but also in the way it works, to better meet the demands of today's global economy. Full-scale engagements are taking place to improve the WTO's functions, and we remain hopeful that these efforts will yield meaningful deliverables at the 14th Ministerial Conference scheduled for next March.

 While navigating reforms for the WTO amid the multilateral gridlock and geo-economic fragmentation, economies have resorted to plurilateral and regional activities. Plurilateral initiatives are a logical and realistic vehicle to make progress in the interim, particularly when it is increasingly difficult to achieve consensus across all WTO membership. That said, we should maintain the supremacy of the multilateral trading system in governing global trade, through leveraging APEC as the premier forum for multilateral engagement. As an incubator of innovative ideas, APEC has a unique role to play in fostering regional dialogue, contributing constructively to the ongoing WTO reform process and facilitating international co-operation.

 APEC itself has also been active in addressing issues that affect the region, such as enhancing the resilience of our supply chains against shocks and threats. Being an externally oriented economy, seamless and effective supply chains are essential to Hong Kong, China. Among other strategies, we have leveraged technological innovations, not least artificial intelligence, in this context. For instance, AI is applied to facilitate customs enforcement, cargo clearance and matchmaking for airline partnerships. We are also actively building connectivity on trade single window with key trading partners such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. We look forward to sharing our experiences with member economies, so that we can jointly enhance the resiliency and adaptability of the supply chains in the region.

 Hong Kong, China remains committed to working with member economies to overcome the challenges we face, whether they are short-term shocks or long-term structural shifts, so that we can achieve shared prosperity.

 Thank you, Chair.

 On behalf of the Hong Kong, China (HKC) delegation, let me begin by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to Korea for the warm hospitality and for hosting us in this historic and beautiful city of Gyeongju.

 The rapid development of digital technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), is fundamentally changing our societies at an unprecedented pace. To fully harness the benefits and smoothen the transformation process, HKC strongly supports deepening APEC's digital co-operation to foster economic growth and address common challenges. To this end, I would like to offer three suggestions.

 First, we must provide an enabling environment for digital innovation to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. This calls for strengthening infrastructure and adopting an application-oriented approach to promote deep integration of AI across the economy. HKC has been taking concrete actions. In terms of infrastructure, apart from the Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre established last year, we will develop an additional high-performing data facility cluster to provide advanced computing power for innovation. To promote AI adoption, we are attempting regulatory innovations like the AI sandbox for financial institutions, accelerating the digital transformation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and upgrading our trade architecture with AI. Our Government is also leading by example. As announced by our Chief Executive in his Policy Address last month, we are forming an AI Efficacy Enhancement Team to drive technological reform and modernise workflows across government agencies.

 Second, we must ensure that the benefits of digital advancement are shared across all sectors. With a people-centred approach, HKC is tackling key challenges such as digital divides and job displacements that are impeding an inclusive digital transition. Besides developing a strategic blueprint that will incorporate AI literacy into the core curriculum and enhance teacher training to ensure our next generation is future-ready, we are also reforming retraining programmes and strengthening re-employment support for our current workforce.

 Third, we should leverage APEC's unique role as an incubator of ideas to advance digital co-operation. Over the past decade, APEC has made significant strides in its digital agenda, from the APEC Internet and Digital Economy Roadmap to the APEC AI Initiative this year. We particularly commend Korea's leadership in mainstreaming AI across APEC's agenda, effectively connecting it to both traditional and emerging issues such as trade, demographic changes as well as cultural and creative industries. HKC is pleased to endorse these efforts and will continue to actively contribute to APEC's co-operation.

 In closing, HKC recognises AI as a key enabler to realise the APEC Putrajaya Vision 2040. We look forward to working together with fellow member economies to leverage digital co-operation and build a vibrant digital ecosystem across the Asia-Pacific region for the prosperity of our people and future generations. Thank you."
HKMoA receives artist Kong Kai-ming's donation of 100 watercolour paintings (with photos),2025-10-30 12:06,2025-10-30 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000266.htm,"The Hong Kong Museum of Art (HKMoA) has recently received another significant donation of Hong Kong art. Hong Kong's renowned artist Kong Kai-ming has generously donated 100 watercolour paintings of Hong Kong's natural scenery and geological features to the HKMoA's permanent collection, which demonstrate Kong's keen observation and portrayal of nature as well as his deep affection for Hong Kong. The Director of Leisure and Cultural Services, Ms Manda Chan, presented a certificate of appreciation to Kong on behalf of the department.

Born in 1932, Kong has been dedicated to artistic creation and art education for over 70 years. In addition to painting and teaching, he has released more than 60 art-related publications, making significant contributions to Hong Kong's art scene. Capturing Hong Kong's streets and scenery with detailed brushwork, his works document the changes in the city's urban landscape and natural beauty. As a home-grown Hong Kong artist, Kong gives himself a sense of responsibility to capture and convey Hong Kong's unique beauty through his art. Since several years ago, he has begun meticulously selecting his most cherished works for donation to the HKMoA as a heartfelt tribute to the city that he loves.

The paintings donated were completed between 2011 and 2023. In a realistic approach, Kong captures the stunning beauty of nature through rich compositions, varied perspectives, meticulous brushwork and vibrant colours, presenting the diverse shapes, textures and hues of mountains and rocks. With a soft brush, he masterfully portrays the hardness of stone, such as the twisted rock pillars of the High Island Reservoir and the extraordinary rock formation at the Bluff Head, bringing these scenes vividly to life. Some paintings, such as ""Port Island"", provide background information on the rock formation, adding geological significance beyond their artistic value.

In 2006, Kong was awarded the Bronze Bauhinia Star by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, recognising his outstanding contributions to art education.

Established in 1962, the HKMoA is the first public art museum in Hong Kong, dedicated to preserving and promoting local art. At present, the HKMoA is the custodian of an art collection of over 19 700 items, spanning historical eras from the Neolithic Age to contemporary times, representing the cultural significance and richness of artistic heritage from Hong Kong and beyond."

Professor Guo (Provost of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Professor Guo Yike), Professor Qu (Dean of Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Professor Huamin Qu), Professor Song (Director of the Media Intelligence Research Center, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Professor Celine Song), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my pleasure to join this forum, which brings together visionary minds to explore how trust, governance and innovation can shape the future of artificial intelligence. Let me begin by extending my warmest congratulations on the inauguration of the Media Intelligence Research Center of the HKUST (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology).

  First of all, I am happy to share with you that the National 15th Five-Year Plan has just confirmed the support for Hong Kong in building an international I&T (innovation and technology) centre. We are standing at the forefront of a global technological shift. AI is rapidly reshaping industries, economies and societies. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the global AI market is expected to reach about US$4.8 trillion by 2033, which is a 25-fold increase in 10 years from now. This remarkable growth underscores the urgent need for economies around the world to formulate and implement policies that balance the immense potential and the underlying risks of AI, ensuring its sustainable and inclusive development.

  The Government has spared no effort in promoting sound AI governance while fostering the advancement of industry. One of the cornerstones is the Ethical Artificial Intelligence Framework, first introduced in 2021, which covers 12 core principles from fairness and transparency to human oversight, implementation guidelines and risk assessment tools. The aim is to help organisations embed ethical considerations when implementing IT projects, ensuring that their AI systems are not only effective but also responsible. To keep up with the evolving AI landscape, the updated version introduced in 2023 further sharpened its relevance and recommended clearer practices to address emerging risks.

  Complementing our ethical framework is the Principles of Data Governance promulgated by the Government in 2024, which provide a foundational layer for reliable AI development. As data powers every stage of the life cycle of an AI system, from training to application, its quality, integrity and responsible use are essential. This Data Governance document promotes lawful sharing, privacy protection and accountability, helping organisations unlock the value of data in a responsible and ethical manner. This is crucial to our broader governance efforts.

  In view of the growing use of generative AI across sectors, the Government sees the merits in developing a practical framework for safe and responsible adoption that is tailored to Hong Kong's context with contribution from professionals. The Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center (HKGAI), under the leadership of Professor Guo Yike, was commissioned to put together the Hong Kong Generative Artificial Intelligence Technical and Application Guideline for release in April 2025. By leveraging the HKGAI's experience in building Hong Kong's first locally adapted large language model, the guideline provides clear, pragmatic and actionable advice for developers, service providers and users in the application of AI technology, covering key risks of data leakage, model bias and misinformation, and recommendations on safeguarding model training, deployment and content integrity.

  The Government also takes the lead in building a vibrant AI ecosystem by advancing the integration of AI into public services, recognising its potential to enhance efficiency, responsiveness and citizen experience. As announced in the 2025 Policy Address, a dedicated AI Efficacy Enhancement Team is set up to promote AI applications across government departments and explore process re-engineering to elevate public services. In parallel, the Digital Policy Office will roll out various AI applications in respect of data analysis, customer service and document processing.

  Alongside various initiatives to expand AI application scenarios in public services, the Government introduced the AI Adoption Guide for Government bureaux and departments earlier this year. It outlines strategies, practical guidelines and facilitation measures for AI adoption, with a strong emphasis on top-down leadership and a business-led ""AI+"" approach. It further encourages departments to identify operational challenges and explore the deployment of AI to enhance efficiency and improve service quality, serving as a catalyst for public service transformation.

  A thriving AI ecosystem counts not only on innovation and technology, but also strong and adaptive governance. Compliance across both public and private sectors is vital to protect data, uphold standards and build public trust. I appreciate the cross-sectoral effort in promoting responsible innovation and reliable AI governance.

  Before I close, I wish this forum every success, and look forward to witnessing Hong Kong's AI development scaling new heights. Thank you."

運輸署歡迎有興趣的機構或企業提交自動車先導牌照申請。在接獲申請後，署方會按《自動駕駛車輛測試及先導使用實務守則》考慮自動駕駛系統的設計運行範圍及功能、相關的國家標準（國標）或國際標準／指引、道路測試情況等多方面因素審批。其中，署方一直接受國標以證明車輛或其部件符合相關技術要求及車輛構造標準。此外，署方會參考自動車在香港以外地區（包括內地）的測試經驗及表現，例如依照國標進行測試的報告，以評估車輛的自動駕駛性能。

二○二五年《施政報告》提出推廣自動車。政府會繼續推動業界在不同社區展開自動車測試與應用，以期邁向無人化、規模化，亦希望能達至商業營運，推動業界藉香港平台開拓海外尤其是右軚市場。政府會持續以駕駛和路面安全為首要原則，汲取經驗優化技術標準，並適時與業界共享研究成果，審慎有序地落實上述工作。"
TD issues pilot licence for autonomous vehicles to approve cross-district trial in Kowloon East,2025-10-30 11:23,2025-10-30 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025102900367.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) announced today (October 30) that a pilot licence for autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been issued to approve routes for cross-district AV trial in Kowloon East, in accordance with section 4(1) of the Road Traffic (Autonomous Vehicles) Regulation (Cap. 374AA).

  The applicant has been approved to conduct trials for 10 AVs on specified road sections in the vicinity of the Kai Tak Development Area and Kowloon Bay. In the first phase of road tests, a total of six autonomous private cars will operate simultaneously at a specified time in Kowloon City District and Kwun Tong District from ""Runway 1331"" (a Youth Post hostel project) to MTR Kai Tak Station. The routes cover Shing Fung Road, Shing Kai Road, Muk On Street, Kai Shing Street, Kai Wah Street, Wang Kwong Road, Kai Shun Road, Wang Chiu Road, Kai Cheung Road, Sheung Yuet Road, Sheung Yee Road, Concorde Road and Muk Yuen Street. During the trial, a backup operator will be stationed in the vehicle at all times to take over control when necessary.

  A spokesman for the TD said that the first AV trial project in Hong Kong in North Lantau has made significant progress since its launch at end-2024. With continuous monitoring and active facilitation by the TD, it has achieved four notable technical advancements, namely the simultaneous operation of multiple vehicles, passenger-carrying trials, expanded routes and increased vehicle speeds. The TD also approved the applicant in June and August 2025 to conduct road tests in Tung Chung and Cyberport in Southern District respectively. The projects have largely been smooth to date, and the performance of the AVs has remained stable. This pilot project spanning Kowloon City and Kwun Tong Districts, encompassing the Kai Tak Development Area, will provide more trial data for the performance assessment of more different road scenarios in cross-district operations.

  The TD's label for pilot AV shall be displayed on all pilot AVs for identification by other road users. Details of the pilot licence have been uploaded to the TD's website on AV trials.

  The TD welcomes interested organisations or enterprises to submit applications for a pilot licence. Upon receipt of an application, the TD will consider various factors, including the design operating range and functions of the autonomous system, relevant national or international standards/guidelines, and the road test situations, based on the Code of Practice for Trial and Pilot Use of Autonomous Vehicles before approval. Among them, the TD has been accepting submissions of the Guobiao (GB) to substantiate that the vehicles or their components comply with the relevant technical requirements and vehicle construction standards. In addition, the operation experience and performance of AV in areas outside Hong Kong (including the Mainland), such as test reports in accordance with the GB, will be taken into consideration by the TD in evaluating the performance of the vehicle automation.

  The Policy Address 2025 set out the promotion of AVs. The Government will continue to facilitate the industry to conduct AV trials and applications across various communities, aiming to accelerate progress towards driverless and large-scale development. The Government also aspires to achieve commercial operation, encouraging the industry to leverage Hong Kong as a platform to explore overseas markets, particularly those with right-hand drive systems. Driving and road safety remain the top priority, and the Government will draw on practical experience to refine technical standards, share research findings with the industry in a timely manner, and implement these initiatives in a prudent and orderly process."
財經事務及庫務局局長在2025年金融街論壇年會「京港聯動　共贏未來」平行論壇致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-10-30 11:15,2025-10-30 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000264.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇今日（十月三十日）在2025年金融街論壇年會「京港聯動共贏未來」平行論壇的致辭全文：

尊敬的孫巿長（北京巿政府副巿長孫碩）、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們，

大家好！很榮幸在2025年金融街論壇年會「京港聯動 共贏未來」平行論壇上發言，與來自全球的業界領袖共同探討「創新、變革、重塑下的全球金融發展」。我謹代表香港特別行政區政府，感謝主辦方提供這一重要平台，讓我們共商京港金融合作，助力國家高質量發展。

當前，全球經濟正處於變革與重塑的關鍵時期，金融業作為科技與產業融合的橋樑，承載着推動創新、提升效率的重要使命。北京作為國家的金融管理中心，是國家多個重要金融監管機構的所在地、同時匯聚眾多龍頭企業總部，是政策與創新的核心；香港則作為國際金融中心，在最新《全球金融中心指數》中穩居全球第三、亞洲第一，憑藉在「一國兩制」下擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢：資金、人才、資訊、數據自由流通，實施普通法制度，成為聯繫國內外市場的理想平台。京港兩地優勢互補，合作潛力無限，將共同為國家金融開放和「一帶一路」建設注入新動力。

京港協同，服務實體經濟

國家強調金融服務實體經濟，加快構建現代化金融市場體系，並持續推進金融業對外開放。京港在這一進程中擁有廣闊合作空間。香港作為國家和國際雙循環重要交匯點，將充分發揮資本市場優勢，為北京企業「走出去」提供支持，促進新質生產力發展，推動高質量經濟增長。

香港作為全球領先的集資中心，為北京企業開拓國際及「一帶一路」市場提供重要平台。截至上月底，接近230家北京企業在港上市，總市值近13萬億港元，佔香港股票市場市值大概四分之一左右，累計融資超過3萬億港元。北京企業來港上市，既滿足了自身的融資需要，同時也推動香港資本市場的發展，讓投資者有更多優質的投資選擇，也讓兩地互惠的金融合作開創了新局面。

為適應新經濟企業需求，港交所（香港交易及結算所有限公司）持續優化上市制度。二○二三年三月推出的專精特新企業上市機制，便利新一代訊息技術、先進硬件及軟件、先進材料、新能源等科技企業上市。繼生物科技企業上市改革成功後，進一步為國家創新企業提供國際資本渠道，配合支持專精特新企業的國家政策。同時，庫存股份機制、IPO（首次公開招股）審批流程優化及新股定價機制改革，提升了香港資本市場的包容性與國際競爭力。

企業財資與財富管理

香港為北京企業提供先進的企業財資及財富管理服務，這是融資以外的另一重點。合資格企業財資中心享有利得稅減半優惠，吸引不少總部位於北京的內地企業在港設立財資中心，管理現金、融資、外匯及對沖業務，降低財務成本。自稅務優惠計劃推出以來，香港金融管理局已與約850間企業接觸，逾140間企業，當中包括40多間總部位於北京的企業，計劃或已在港設立財資中心。我們正研究優化稅務寬減，預計二○二六年上半年完成。

在財富管理方面，香港可以為內地企業及個人投資者提供全面的服務。截至去年底，香港管理超過35萬億港元資產，其中百分之六十四來自非香港投資者。另一方面，內地與香港基金互認安排認可82個基金，截至今年七月銷售淨額超過1,100億元人民幣。北京企業可利用香港的開放式基金型公司、有限合夥基金及房地產投資信託基金融資及拓展全球業務。香港的家族辦公室生態亦支持財富管理與傳承，我們正推動一系列政策，讓家族辦公室和資產擁有人在香港蓬勃發展。

風險管理與保險

金融除了融資、財富管理，風險管理也是其中非常重要的一環。香港作為環球保險樞紐，為北京企業提供多元化風險管理方案。北京的保險公司分出業務予合資格的香港專業再保險公司，可享有資本要求優待。

在應對天然災害及氣候變化風險方面，我們推出了專屬監管制度和資助計劃，便利包括巨災債券在內的保險相連證券在港發行。自二○二一年起，香港促成七宗巨災債券發行，有效把保險風險透過證券化轉移到資本市場，總額近八億美元。此外，保險相連證券資助先導計劃延長至二○二八年，補貼前期費用降低發行成本，持續推動更多相關證券發行。

我們亦鼓勵內地企業在港設立專屬自保保險公司（自保公司），內地十家自保公司中，六家在香港成立，包括中海油、中石化及中廣核等國企，體現香港作為自保保險中心的吸引力。

結語

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，京港兩地的金融合作前景非常廣闊、機遇無限。香港將繼續發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，以自身所長服務國家所需，助力國家「走出去」和「引進來」戰略的實施。我們相信，通過京港彼此兩地的緊密合作、優勢互補、資源共享，作為國家的金融管理中心和國際金融中心，必將為兩地金融業的高質量發展注入新的動力。謝謝大家！"

"Five property owners fined over $500,000 in total for not complying with removal orders",2025-10-30 11:00,2025-10-30 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000226.htm,"Five owners were convicted and fined $510,190 in total at the Magistrates' Courts on Tuesday (October 28) for failing to comply with removal orders issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123).

 The first case involved three unauthorised structures with a total area of about 75 square metres on a flat roof and rooftop of a residential building on San Lok Street, Sheung Shui. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), three removal orders were served on the two concerned owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failure to comply with the removal orders, they were prosecuted by the BD and were fined $317,710 in total, of which $222,710 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued, upon conviction at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts.

 The second case involved a three-storey unauthorised structure with an area of about 100 sq m at Sheung Wo Hang, Sha Tau Kok. Since the Lands Department would not issue a certificate of exemption for the UBWs and they were also carried out without prior approval and consent from the BD, a removal order was served on the two co-owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failure to comply with the removal order, they were prosecuted by the BD and were fined $104,280 in total, of which $84,280 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued, upon conviction at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts.

 The third case involved unauthorised alterations at the basement of an industrial building at Kwun Tong Road, Kwun Tong, including erection of a structure at the entrance of a staircase, replacement of fire-resisting concrete block walls by glazed walls of an inadequate fire rating and removal of fire-resisting concrete block walls and fire-resisting doors at cold-storage godowns. The alteration works affected the fire-resisting construction of the building and contravened the Building (Construction) Regulation. A removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failure to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD and was fined $88,200 in total, of which $53,200 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued, upon conviction at the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts.

 A spokesman for the BD said today (October 30), ""UBWs, including unauthorised alterations affecting the fire-resisting construction of a building, may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

 Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

陳茂波指出，在全球地緣經貿格局日趨碎片化的背景下，中國及其他亞洲地區與中東地區的經貿金融關係正持續深化。香港將進一步發揮國際金融中心和國際一流專業服務的獨特優勢，積極助力內地企業「走出去」，佈局產業鏈和供應鏈，以及拓展海外市場；同時，亦為有意進軍內地和亞洲市場的中東企業提供資金和專業服務等支持。此外，憑藉高度國際化的金融體系、多元化的資金渠道，以及創新的融資方案，香港可進一步推動兩地的資金跨境流動，及以基建貸款證券化等創新模式，為基建投資提供靈活多元的融資方案。

陳茂波也表示，香港正加速推動與中東之間的跨境金融與創科產業合作，包括資本市場的互聯互通，例如互掛交易所買賣基金（ETF），以及鼓勵中東企業來港上市。另外在創科方面，香港以及粵港澳大灣區的初創和科技企業亦有不少已落戶中東發展業務。在回答提問時，陳茂波表示香港正加大力度發展人工智能，包括發展人工智能為核心產業，並以人工智能賦能各行各業升級轉型；政府亦帶頭應用人工智能提升效率和服務質素。

陳茂波其後帶同代表團前往沙特國家銀行（Saudi National Bank）訪問，與銀行的高層管理人員座談交流。該銀行是當地規模最大的國有商業銀行。香港代表團成員分別介紹其業務，並表示希望與沙特當地的金融機構、投資者和企業對接，以進入中東市場。陳茂波作總結發言時表示，香港正積極促進與沙特之間雙向的投資和資金流動，特別是支持香港和內地企業在中東投資興業，期望雙方加強合作，拓展更大商機。

下午，陳茂波率領代表團前往數字合作組織（Digital Cooperation Organization）總部，與該組織總幹事Hajar El Haddaoui博士會面。數字合作組織是一個多邊國際組織，總部設於沙特阿拉伯利雅得，旨在促進成員國之間在數字經濟領域的合作與協同發展。該組織目前涵蓋來自中東、亞洲、非洲等多個地區的16個成員國，以及39個來自區外的國家、國際組織和商業機構等的觀察員，其核心任務包括提升數字基礎設施、促進普惠包容的科技創新、加強青年與婦女在科技領域的參與，以及建立有利於數字企業發展的國際合作平台。

會上，代表團成員介紹了其業務重點和未來發展方向。數字合作組織非常歡迎代表團的到訪，並表示希望推動組織成員國的初創和創科企業與代表團加強交流，促進兩地的創科與產業合作。

代表團亦前往阿卜杜勒阿齊茲國王科技城（King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology）旗下的創科孵化平台「The Garage」參訪，深入了解其運作，以及當地政府在培育初創企業方面的政策。雙方亦探討了企業孵化、人才交流及科研等領域的合作。

FS continues to lead delegation to visit Saudi Arabia (with photos/video),2025-10-30 09:00,2025-10-30 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000040.htm,"âThe Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, continued his official visit to Saudi Arabia yesterday (October 29, Riyadh time), leading a delegation to participate in activities of the Future Investment Initiative (FII). During the visit, Mr Chan engaged in in-depth exchanges with local political and business leaders, and visited local innovation and technology institutions, as well as urban planning and conservation projects.

In the morning, Mr Chan attended a breakfast session hosted by HSBC at the FII and took part in a fireside chat, during which he shared his insights on the prospects for strengthening economic, trade and financial ties between Hong Kong and the Middle East.

Mr Chan noted that against the backdrop of increasing global geopolitical and economic fragmentation, economic and financial links between China as well as other parts of Asia and the Middle East continue to deepen. Hong Kong will further leverage its role as an international financial centre and provider of world-class professional services to support Mainland enterprises in going global, expanding their industrial and supply chains, and tapping into overseas markets. At the same time, Hong Kong stands ready to offer capital and professional services to Middle Eastern businesses seeking to enter the Mainland and Asian markets. Furthermore, with its highly internationalised financial system, diversified financing channels, and innovative financial solutions, Hong Kong is well placed to promote cross-border capital flows as well as provide diversified and flexible infrastructure financing models, such as infrastructure loan securitisation.

Mr Chan added that Hong Kong is accelerating cross-border financial and innovation and technology collaboration with the Middle East. This includes enhancing capital market connectivity, such as mutual listing of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and encouraging Middle Eastern businesses to list in Hong Kong. In terms of innovation and technology, a number of start-ups and tech companies from Hong Kong and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area have already established a presence in the Middle East. In response to questions, Mr Chan said Hong Kong is stepping up efforts to develop artificial intelligence (AI), both as a core industry and as an enabler to help upgrade and transform various sectors. The Government is also taking the lead in adopting AI to enhance efficiency and service quality.

Later in the day, Mr Chan and the delegation visited the Saudi National Bank, the largest state-owned commercial bank in the country, and attended a meeting with its senior management. Members of the Hong Kong delegation introduced their respective businesses and conveyed interest in connecting with financial institutions, investors and enterprises in Saudi Arabia in order to explore opportunities in the Middle Eastern market. In the concluding remarks, Mr Chan highlighted Hong Kong's active role in fostering two-way investment and capital flows with Saudi Arabia, particularly in supporting Hong Kong and Chinese Mainland enterprises to invest and establish businesses in the region. He expressed the hope that both sides would enhance co-operation and seize greater business opportunities.

In the afternoon, the delegation visited the headquarters of the Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO) and met with its Director-General, Dr Hajar El Haddaoui. The DCO is a multilateral international organisation based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, aimed at fostering co-operation and coordinated development among member states in the digital economy. Currently comprising 16 member countries from the Middle East, Asia and Africa, and 39 observers including non-regional countries, international organisations and business entities, the DCO's core objectives include enhancing digital infrastructure, promoting inclusive and innovative technology, increasing youth and women participation in technology, and establishing international co-operation platforms conducive to the growth of digital enterprises.

During the meeting, members of the delegation outlined their core business areas and future development directions. The DCO warmly welcomed the delegation and expressed interest in facilitating greater exchanges between start-ups and innovation enterprises from its member states and the Hong Kong delegation, with a view to promoting innovation and industrial co-operation between the two sides.

The delegation also visited The Garage, an innovation and technology incubation platform under the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, to gain a deeper understanding of its operations and the local government's policies in nurturing start-ups. Both sides discussed potential collaboration in areas such as incubation, talent exchanges and scientific research.

Subsequently, the delegation visited Diriyah and visited the At-Turaif, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. They also learnt more about the Diriyah Gate Project, a major urban revitalisation initiative. The visit provided insights into local strategies and latest developments in heritage conservation, city planning and the diversification of the tourism sector.

In the evening, Mr Chan attended a welcome dinner hosted by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade for Chinese and Saudi business communities.

Mr Chan will continue his visit in Riyadh today (October 30, Riyadh time) before concluding the trip and returning to Hong Kong."
調整基本利率,2025-10-30 08:00,2025-10-30 08:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000138.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局今日（十月三十日）宣布，基本利率根據預設公式定於4.25厘，即時生效。

基本利率是用作計算經貼現窗進行回購交易時適用的貼現率的基礎利率。目前基本利率定於當前的美國聯邦基金利率目標區間的下限加50基點，或隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息的五天移動平均數的平均值，以較高者為準。

因應美國於十月二十九日（美國時間）調低聯邦基金利率的目標區間25基點，當前的美國聯邦基金利率目標區間的下限加50基點是4.25%，而隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息的五天移動平均數的平均值是3.21%，所以根據預設公式，基本利率設定於4.25%。"
Adjustment of Base Rate,2025-10-30 08:00,2025-10-30 08:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000136.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced today (October 30) that the Base Rate has been set at 4.25 per cent with immediate effect according to a pre-set formula.

The Base Rate is the interest rate forming the foundation upon which the Discount Rates for repurchase transactions through the Discount Window are computed. The Base Rate is currently set at either 50 basis points above the lower end of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.

Following the 25-basis point downward adjustment in the target range for the US federal funds rate on October 29 (US time), 50 basis points above the lower end of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate is 4.25 per cent, while the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs is 3.21 per cent. The Base Rate is therefore set at 4.25 per cent according to the pre-set formula."

Through intelligence analysis, Hong Kong Customs intercepted two express parcels from Belgium, declared as pesticides, that were sent to Hong Kong via the Chinese Mainland on October 24 and yesterday (October 28) and discovered a total of 20 kilograms of suspected ketamine concealed inside plastic buckets from the parcels. The total estimated market value was about $9 million.

Customs officers subsequently mounted a controlled delivery operation yesterday and arrested two men, aged 21 and 77, suspected to be connected with the case in Cheung Sha Wan. Customs officers also seized HK$420,000 in cash from the 21-year-old man's private car.

The two men have been charged with two counts of attempting to traffic in a dangerous drug and will appear in the West Kowloon Magistrates' Court tomorrow (October 30).

Customs reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people, nor to release their personal data or home address to others for receiving parcels or goods.

Customs will continue to maintain close contact with Hongkong Post and the logistics industries to step up action against drug trafficking through postal parcel or express courier channels.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk)."
