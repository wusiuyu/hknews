Red flag hoisted at Clear Water Bay Second Beach,2025-12-20 10:25,2025-12-20 10:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/20/P2025122000233.htm,"Attention TV/radio announcers:

Please broadcast the following as soon as possible:

政府邀請港鐵公司就南港島線（西段）項目開展詳細規劃及設計,2025-12-20 10:15,2025-12-20 10:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/20/P2025122000213.htm,"​行政長官會同行政會議已批准政府邀請香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵公司）開展南港島線（西段）項目的詳細規劃及設計。

南港島線（西段）項目將採用智慧綠色集體運輸系統，包括長約7.5公里的專屬高架橋及隧道、八個車站（分別為黃竹坑、香港仔、田灣、華貴、華富、數碼港、瑪麗醫院及香港大學）及一個鄰近數碼港站的車廠。項目將為香港西區及南區約13萬居民以及區內主要設施例如瑪麗醫院、數碼港等，提供穩健、環保、便捷的接駁交通服務，便利市民前往港鐵南港島線（東段）黃竹坑站和港島線香港大學站。南港島線（西段）將與南港島線（東段）及港島線形成一個環狀網絡，提升鐵路網絡的抗禦能力。

南港島線（西段）項目將為區內居民提供替代道路交通的新集體運輸出行方式，減少出行時間。現時從華富邨經黃竹坑到金鐘的車程為約35分鐘，從華富邨到香港大學的車程則為約25分鐘。當南港島線（西段）通車後，這兩段車程將分別縮短至約20分鐘和10分鐘。

運輸及物流局發言人表示：「項目沿線地勢起伏，其中華富邨與香港仔海旁的高度相差超過60米，如採用重型鐵路，走線須深入地底，運輸及成本效益皆不理想，方案在財務上不可行。我們以創新思維，迎難而上，選擇採用在專屬高架橋及隧道行走的智慧綠色集體運輸系統，提高整體成本效益。與原來的地底重鐵方案相比，建造成本預算可減少約四成，落成時間則可提前約兩年。」

政府已邀請港鐵公司開展南港島線（西段）的詳細規劃及設計，並將與港鐵公司協商項目的財務安排。南港島線（西段）的前期工程預計於二○二七年展開及於二○三四年或之前竣工，以配合區內發展包括華富邨重建計劃新增人口遷入的時間表。"
Government invites MTRCL to proceed with detailed planning and design of South Island Line (West) project,2025-12-20 10:15,2025-12-20 10:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/20/P2025122000214.htm,"âThe Chief Executive in Council has given approval for the Government to invite the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) to proceed with the detailed planning and design of the South Island Line (West) (SIL(W)) project.

The SIL(W) project will adopt a smart and green mass transit system and consist of an approximately 7.5-km long dedicated and elevated corridor and tunnel, eight stations (namely Wong Chuk Hang, Aberdeen, Tin Wan, Wah Kwai, Wah Fu, Cyberport, Queen Mary Hospital and HKU) and a depot near the Cyberport Station. It will provide stable, environmentally friendly and convenient feeder service for around 130 000 residents and major facilities such as the Queen Mary Hospital and Cyberport in the western and southern parts of Hong Kong Island, facilitating them to go to Wong Chuk Hang Station of the South Island Line (East) and HKU Station of the Island Line. It will form a transit loop with the South Island Line (East) and Island Line, and will improve the resilience of the railway network.

The SIL(W) will provide residents in the area with an alternative traveling option of new mass transit-based transportation in lieu of road-based transportation, enjoying a shorter journey time. The existing journey time from Wah Fu Estate to Admiralty via Wong Chuk Hang is about 35 minutes and that from Wah Fu Estate to HKU is about 25 minutes. After the commissioning of the SIL(W), the journey time to the two destinations will be reduced to about 20 minutes and 10 minutes respectively.

A spokesperson of the Transport and Logistics Bureau said, ""The alignment of the project passes through hilly terrains. The difference in altitude between Wah Fu Estate and Aberdeen promenade is over 60 metres. If heavy rail system were adopted, some sections would have to be built deep underground. The transport benefit and cost effectiveness are both unsatisfactory, making the underground heavy rail scheme financially not viable. Exercising an innovative approach to rise to the challenges, we decided to adopt a smart and green mass transit system which runs on dedicated elevated viaducts and tunnels to improve the overall cost effectiveness. Compared with the original underground heavy rail scheme, the estimated construction cost is reduced by about 40 per cent and the delivery programme is advanced by about two years.""

The Government has invited the MTRCL to proceed with the detailed planning and design of the SIL(W) project, and will further negotiate with the MTRCL on the financial arrangement of the project. It is targeted to commence the advance construction works in 2027 for completion by 2034 to support developments in the area including the timetable of new population intake of the Wah Fu Estate redevelopment."

Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-19 22:41,2025-12-19 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900995.htm,"  âThe Independent Committee in relation to the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po convened the first meeting today (December 19). The Committee has formally commenced work.

 Moreover, the three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
-----------------------------------

 For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3.5 billion as of noon today. With the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.8 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

 The Government earlier announced that a living allowance from the Support Fund will be provided to each affected household, and the amount has been increased from $50,000 to $100,000. As of today, 1 929 cases have been processed. In addition, the Government will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 144 cases have been processed. The allowance will be disbursed in phases.

 Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 980 affected households, providing the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service to more than 4 900 residents. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government.

Accommodation support
-----------------------------------

 Currently, there is still a supply of more than 1 000 units that can provide affected residents with longer-term accommodation. The transitional housing and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) projects in different districts can altogether provide around 400 units at the moment. Moreover, Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun and Runway 1331 at Kai Tak can provide a supply of around 900 units.

 As of this morning, a total of 613 residents are staying in hotel rooms through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, and 552 residents are staying in youth hostels/camps. Another 3 503 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau, units from the HKHS or Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun.

 The Transport Department (TD) has been steering public transport operators (PTOs) to enhance services of franchised buses, green minibuses and residents' services by deploying additional vehicles and manpower to support residents affected by the fire who have been admitted into transitional housing in various districts, facilitating transfers to other services to and from different districts. Among them, an additional shuttle bus service will be launched connecting Lok Sin Village in Tai Po and Tai Po Market Station; while KMB will extend the service hours of 75K. The TD will closely co-ordinate with operating organisations of transitional housing projects concerned and PTOs to cater for residents' commuting needs.

Relief supplies and donations
-----------------------------------

 Thesupplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received around 2 000 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, over 29 000 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Regulation and inspection work
-----------------------------------

 The Buildings Department (BD) today issued a practice note (available in Chinese only) to registered contractors, setting out a new mechanism for sampling scaffold nets in Hong Kong announced last week. The new mechanism applies to scaffold nets used in repair projects, as well as to those used in new building works.

 To facilitate the implementation of the new mechanism, the BD announced on its website the first batch of designated laboratories and will continuously update the list. Furthermore, the Construction Industry Council (CIC) is preparing for collective bulk procurement and coordinating testing services. The Hong Kong Institute of Construction San Tin Training Ground has been selected as the site for the industry to arrange off-site sampling. The Government and the CIC will work towards having the first batch of scaffold nets reinstalled within a month after procurement and testing.

Others
-----------------------------------

 The Government today invoked Section 31 of the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) and submitted an application to the Lands Tribunal for the dissolution of the existing management committee of the owners' corporation (OC) of Wang Fuk Court. It has also proposed appointing Hop On Management Company Limited (Hop On) under the Chinachem Group as the designated administrator to assist the owners of Wang Fuk Court in handling various management and follow-up matters after the fire. If the Lands Tribunal approves the application, the Home Affairs Department will establish a dedicated team to work closely with Hop On in closely following up on various aspects of building management. This includes handling works contract, following up on insurance claims, financial management, and offering support to residents, etc. Hop On has explicitly stated that it will operate on a pro bono basis for this appointment. At the same time, Nina Wang Charity Management Limited has also expressed that if the Lands Tribunal approves the application, it will donate $5 million to the OC to cover the costs associated with employing lawyers, accountants, or other professional services."

Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected dangerous drugs worth over $10.9 million (with photo),2025-12-19 21:43,2025-12-19 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900952.htm,"Hong Kong Customson December 12 and yesterday (December 18) seized a total of about 20 kilograms of suspected liquid methamphetamine, 10 suspected cannabis oil vape capsules, about 4 grams of suspected cannabis buds, about 3 grams of suspected cocaine and about 270 grams of suspected cracked cocaine with an estimated market value of over $10.9 million at Hong Kong International Airport and in Tsim Sha Tsui.

Through risk assessment, Customs inspected two air parcels, declared as food and candy and arriving in Hong Kong from Mexico on December 12. Upon inspection, Customs officers found that the parcels contained about 20 kilograms of suspected liquid methamphetamine disguised as protective liquid for natural stones in five plastic bottles.

After a follow-up investigation, Customs officers conducted a controlled delivery operation yesterday and arrested two female suspects in Yuen Long and Tsim Sha Tsui, aged 28 and 45 respectively. Later, Customs further seized about 10 suspected cannabis oil vape capsules, about 4 grams of suspected cannabis buds, about 3 grams of suspected cocaine and about 270 grams of suspected cracked cocaine upon premises search in Tsim Sha Tsui. The investigation of the case is ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people, nor to release their personal data or home address to others for receiving parcels or goods.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Customs reminds people to pay attention to the fact that drug trafficking is a serious criminal offence. Criminal conviction will result in grave repercussions for their future and they should not take risks in the hope that they may not be caught. Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)."
Remarks by SHYA at media session regarding management of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po (with photo/video),2025-12-19 20:33,2025-12-19 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900799.htm,"âThe Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, met the media this afternoon (December 19) on the management of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. Following are the remarks at the question-and-answer session:

Reporter: Could you detail in English to speak more about the reason for the Government to directly intervene and dismiss the Wang Fuk Court owner's corporation and also what are the factors being considered to appoint the Chinachem Group as a temporary manager? How long will this takeover last? What is the subsequent plan after that?

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: As I just said, the Government has acted according to the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) section 31 to apply to the Lands Tribunal today to submit an application to dissolve the owners' corporation committee and to appoint Hop On Management Company Limited which is a subsidiary of Chinachem Group as the administrator to handle all the day to day operation of the management committee. This action will only help the owners of the Wang Fuk Court to handle various complicated legal procedures with expert assistance. Hop On Management Company has already stated that they will serve the Wang Fuk Court residents on a pro bono basis, and the Nina Wang Charity Trustees has agreed to contribute five million for professional costs or any procurement costs related to the management of Wang Fuk Court. We try to help the owners of Wang Fuk Court handle all the complicated legal procedures and accounting procedures with expert assistance.

Reporter: Could you please detail the roles of the existing owners’ corporation and the upcoming property manager? Does it include a fire safety? What will you do with the existing property manager? As at this point, do you think it is responsible for the fire safety?

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: As I said, the Hop On Management Company will serve those Wang Fuk Court owners on a pro bono basis and provide them with professional property management services. This act will help the owners to get professional assistance when they decide how to execute or how to make a decision for Wang Fuk Court. The existing management committee and the property management company, as far as we know, the existing contract with the property management company will end by the end of this month. No matter whether they will extend the contract or not, we see that there will be a need for Wang Fuk Court owners to get professional assistance from a professional property management company. We think this is a way to help residents and owners of Wang Fuk Court.

​民政及青年事務局局長就大埔宏福苑管理事宜會見傳媒談話內容（附圖／短片）,2025-12-19 20:32,2025-12-19 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900801.htm,"民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟今日（十二月十九日）下午就大埔宏福苑管理事宜會見傳媒的談話內容：

民政及青年事務局局長︰各位好，政府今天引用了《建築物管理條例》（第344章）第31條，向土地審裁處提交申請，解散現有宏福苑業主立案法團（法團）的管理委員會（管委會），並委任華懋集團旗下的合安管理有限公司為委任管理人，以協助宏福苑業主處理火災後的各項管理及後續事宜。這是特區政府主動啓動此法律程序的首例。

大家都會同意，當前宏福苑的管理正面臨前所未有的挑戰，尤其在大型維修工程後續跟進、相關工程合約及法團維修帳目的處理、保險賠償、現有管理公司約滿後屋苑的管理及保安等複雜問題上，涉及多重技術、法律與財政考量，非一般法團管委會有能力處理。

政府深切體會宏福苑火災受影響居民正面對的巨大困難與不安，明白他們急需獲得適切支援，亦關注法團的現屆管委會是否有能力就各複雜的事宜保障他們的權益。在此艱難時刻，法團管委會成員既要處理自身家庭的各項需要，亦需嘗試協調和跟進剛才所述各項複雜事務，壓力沉重。加上受影響居民正陸續遷往位於不同地區的應急住所，單是接觸及協調各居民的工作亦絕非易事。近日，政府亦收到不少居民的意見，表示希望政府能協助接管法團的管理。

政府經審慎評估後，認為有必要回應居民訴求，因此決定主動介入，依法向土地審裁處提出申請，委任具豐富經驗的專業物業管理公司，即屬華懋集團旗下的合安管理有限公司作為臨時管理人，透過引入專業管理資源，做好屋苑在災後的管理跟進工作，保障所有業主的權益。該公司已明確表示，在此次委任中將不會收取任何行政費用。與此同時，龔如心慈善管理有限公司，即大家熟悉的龔如心慈善信託，亦表示如土地審裁處批出有關申請，會再捐出500萬元予法團支付因須聘用律師、會計師或其他專業服務的費用。簡單而言，臨時管理人的任命能減輕業主在這段期間的財政負擔。

更重要的是，管理人只是取代了法團管委會，代表業主立案法團處理屋苑的管理事務。法團作為依法成立的法人仍然存在，相關申請亦不會影響宏福苑業主對重要屋苑管理事務的最終決定權。具體而言，管理人在處理大型維修工程的後續跟進、相關工程合約、法團帳目管理等複雜問題時，會先尋求專業意見，進行詳細分析，並會向業主做好解説，所有最終決定仍會依照《建築物管理條例》的規定交由業主作投票通過。

如土地審裁處批准有關申請，民政事務總署將成立專班，聯同合安管理有限公司，密切跟進屋苑管理的各項工作，包括工程合約處理、跟進保險索賠、財務管理及居民支援等環節。合安管理有限公司除了每個月向政府提交報告，亦會每三個月向土地審裁處彙報其工作，確保管理過程透明、高效，並符合所有業主整體利益。我們承諾會繼續與居民同行，提供所需協助，共同克服難關。

記者：今次這個做法，為甚麼會選擇合安管理這間公司？有沒有任何招標或程序，如何挑選這間公司？這間公司會在宏福苑做多久，才完成這份合約，不再做委任人？還有作為業主的理解，是否說他們只是取代了原本法團的主席、副主席，可以做一些行政上的安排，他們還是依然需要出席會議去作決定？如果業主不決定的話，是否很多事情都不能夠繼續走下去呢？還有業主跟他們之後怎樣去對接呢？

民政及青年事務局局長︰這個決定，即引用《建築物管理條例》第31條去委任一個管理人時，這個委任管理人（administrator）將取代管委會的工作。每一個屋苑如果成立了一個法人團體，即業主立案法團，當業主立案法團做一些決定時，要根據《建築物管理條例》的要求，包括召開業主大會，或進行各樣招標，或做一些合約決定等，我們現在要做的是由這間合安管理有限公司取代管委會，即法團管委會的工作。即是說他會安排如何尋找專業意見，無論是法律意見等，去協助業主。在這個過程中，我們透過行使這條例賦予的權力去委任一個管理人時，並沒有取代業主立案法團的業主權力。即是說究竟這個法團的管委會以前和多少間公司簽了甚麼合約、或者保單條款是如何、銀行戶口剩餘多少錢、每一項基金是怎樣的，這些資料，我們透過委任管理人，若土地審裁處同意我們的申請，我們可以委任管理人時，管理人便可以得到這些資料，他亦可以聘請專業的律師或專業人士審視現在各項法律程序，然後為業主提供一些充分、全面的意見，讓他們可以根據《建築物管理條例》，若果他們要召開業主大會，需要做決定投票時，業主也能知道怎樣去投票。所以透過管理公司的工作，便可以讓業主得到專業意見，令他們更清楚法律程序。你剛才問他會做多久呢？因為接下來的程序可能是複雜的，所以現在沒有一個很特定的時間，我們向土地審裁處提交的申請，沒有一個特定的時間。但是我們都知道，我們是需要向土地審裁處，剛才亦提到，有關的委任管理人要每個月向政府提交報告，亦要每三個月向土地審裁處提交報告，讓大家知道工作是如何的。

至於委任管理人的選擇上，我們當然希望找到一些專業的、在這個行業服務時間長、能夠為宏福苑業主提供專業服務。合安管理有限公司是隸屬華懋集團，他們願意為業主無償提供服務。而且，龔如心慈善信託基金亦同意，如果土地審裁處同意我們的申請，委任合安管理有限公司作為委任管理人時，基金亦會捐出500萬元。這500萬元就是因為在整個過程中，日後很多可能需要處理法律或合約等過程中，我們可能需要聘請專業人士、專業服務，這500萬元就可以用來應付開支。所以這個工作是可以既幫助到業主，讓他們在這段時間，大家可以想像，宏福苑現在面對的情況，不是一個普通法團能夠處理到，因為問題的複雜性、規模之大，以及急迫性，很多居民都會有關於索償和法律要求等，所以不是一個普通一般的業主立案法團可以處理到。我們正正覺得需要委任管理人，協助業主去做這方面的工作。但是我們又明白，如果在這個時候，你叫業主怎樣再去調動他們的基金，來支付這些專業費用？所以得到龔如心慈善信託基金幫助他們。我們希望在這艱難時刻，面對一個不是一般普通法團能夠面對的情況下，可以為宏福苑業主提供一些專業的支援服務，而且是無償的，希望對於宏福苑的業主，對於日後處理各項合約或各項條文上會更好的。

記者：之前宏福苑現任和前任的業主立案法團成員都被廉署邀請調查，其實這次行動是否與兩任主席都被調查有關？另外，這次申請有否諮詢過宏福苑現任立案法團管委會的成員以及其他居民？如果有的話，他們有沒有表達希望政府接管的信息？謝謝。

民政及青年事務局局長：多謝你。首先，由宏福苑火災發生至今，政府都在不同階段提供適切的幫助。在最初的時候，我們一定是處理居民應急的、生活上的緊急需要。當我們處理緊急的生活需要後，下一步便是居民許多其他關於日後生活的安排，無論是長遠的住屋安排，或是一些法律程序等，所以政府為宏福苑業主提供不同階段性適切的幫助。現在我們引用《建築物管理條例》第31條作決定時，也考慮到現任法團管委會的成員未必能夠處理到現在宏福苑面對如此複雜和規模之大的問題。

另外，在過去一段時間，無論管委會能否成功召開會議，或是管委會成員出現的問題等，都令宏福苑業主非常關注。我們在過去這段時間也收到不同業主的查詢，究竟政府可以怎樣幫助他們，甚至有業主提出希望政府能夠接管法團。剛才我也解釋了，我們這次的行動不是接管法團，我們是接管法團的管委會。即是我們在這工作上絕對沒有剝奪業主的權力，反而是幫助他們更好地得到專業管理公司的幫助和專業的法律顧問服務，讓他們可以更好地行使權力，為宏福苑做一些更好的決定。我們日後的工作其實仍然是要跟從《建築物管理條例》不同的規定，包括如果要做決定時，要召開業主大會，並要為業主提供足夠的資訊等。

至於現屆的管委會，我們向土地審裁處申請時，審裁官會考慮邀請不同人士表達意見，所以會交由土地審裁處去進行相關程序。我們今日已向土地審裁處遞交申請，申請的原因是宏福苑正面對一個從未試過的、規模之大的複雜局面，一般的、普通的業主立案法團管委會成員應該不能處理，我們希望在這段時間，為宏福苑的業主提供專業服務，令業主能夠更好去處理日後一系列複雜的法律程序。我們也得到龔如心慈善信託基金和華懋集團同意，華懋集團的管理公司將提供無償服務，不需要動用到現屆管委會或法團現有的基金，亦可以得到一筆捐款，讓他們可以聘請到需要的專業服務。

43 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photo),2025-12-19 19:07,2025-12-19 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900730.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Silver Wing"" and ""Twilight"", joint operations with the Labour Department codenamed ""Lightshadow"" and ""Rainbow"", a joint operation with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department codenamed ""Flabbergast"", and a joint operation with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Champion"" from December 14 to yesterday (December 18). A total of 34 suspected illegal workers, five suspected employers and four overstayers were arrested.

  During operation ""Silver Wing"", ImmD officers raided 10 target locations, including restaurants and a laundry factory. Seventeen suspected illegal workers and two suspected employers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised 10 men and seven women, aged 21 to 49. Among the arrestees, two were visitors, while the remaining 15 were imported workers who were suspected of breaching their conditions of stay by performing duties at a non-contractual workplace or by performing duties that were not stipulated in the contract. Two men, aged 33 and 50, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested.

  During a joint operation with the Labour Department codenamed ""Lightshadow"", investigators raided 102 target locations, and a total of three suspected illegal workers were arrested for allegedly engaging in food delivery work. The three arrested suspected illegal workers are non-ethnic Chinese males, aged 31 to 42, who were non-refoulement claimants holding recognizance forms that prohibit them from taking any employment in Hong Kong.

  During other anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers targeted different industries and raided multiple locations including renovation flats, a leather repair store, warehouses and restaurants etc. Fourteen suspected illegal workers, three suspected employers and four overstayers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised six men and eight women, aged 22 to 62. Among them, a woman was suspected of using and being in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card. Three Hong Kong female residents, aged 62 to 88, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested.

  Investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Moreover, after entry into the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the imported worker admitted on an employment condition must remain under the direct employment of the same employer for the specified job and in the specific workplace(s) as stipulated in the Standard Employment Contract and cannot be employed by other companies or subcontractors. Change of the employer, post or place of work (unless stipulated in the Standard Employment Contract) is not permitted. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged identity card or an identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."
反非法勞工行動拘四十三人（附圖）,2025-12-19 19:07,2025-12-19 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900727.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十二月十四日至昨日（十二月十八日）在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，包括「銀翼行動」、「曙光行動」，聯同勞工處執行的「光影行動」及「彩虹行動」，聯同食物環境衞生署和康樂及文化事務署執行的「驚愕行動」，以及聯同香港警務處執行的「冠軍行動」。截至昨日，行動中共拘捕三十四名懷疑非法勞工、五名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及四名逾期逗留人士。

其中於「銀翼行動」中，調查人員搜查了十個目標地點，包括餐廳及洗衣工場，共拘捕十七名懷疑非法勞工及兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為十男七女，年齡介乎二十一至四十九歲，除兩名人士為訪港旅客外，其餘十五名人士均為輸入勞工，涉嫌於非其合約指定的地點工作或擔任非合約指定的職位，從而違反逗留條件被捕。而涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為兩名男子，年齡為三十三及五十歲。

至於在聯同勞工處執行的「光影行動」中，調查人員共搜查了一百零二個目標地點，共拘捕三名懷疑從事外賣工作的非法勞工，均為非華裔男子，年齡介乎三十一至四十二歲，全部皆是免遣返聲請人士，持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）。

於其他的反非法勞工行動中，調查人員針對不同行業搜查了多個目標地點，當中包括裝修中單位、皮具維修中心、物流貨倉以及餐廳食肆等，共拘捕十四名懷疑非法勞工、三名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及四名逾期逗留人士。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為六男八女，年齡介乎二十二至六十二歲，當中一名女子涉嫌行使及管有懷疑偽造身份證。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為三名女子，年齡分別介乎六十二至八十八歲。

就上述有關僱主涉嫌聘用非法勞工的個案，目前正在調查中。不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。另外，輸入勞工獲准以僱傭身分來港後，必須按『標準僱傭合約』所訂明直接受僱於合約中指定的同一僱主，並擔任合約中指定的職位及在指定的地點工作，而且不可受僱於其他公司或次承判商，亦不可轉換僱主、職位或工作地點（『標準僱傭合約』訂明的工作地點除外）。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆違反逗留條件者同罪。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

市民可使用舉報非法勞工專線3861 5000、傳真2824 1166、電郵anti_crime@immd.gov.hk、或登入入境處網址www.immd.gov.hk利用「網上舉報違反入境條例罪行」表格向入境處舉報僱用非法勞工活動。"

李家超歡迎胡德福率團訪港。李家超表示，越南是香港第六大貿易夥伴，雙方經貿關係密切，今年首三季的雙邊商品貿易總額已達到490億美元，較去年同期顯著增長百分之六十七。去年，他率領高級別商務代表團訪問越南，雙方簽署了30份合作備忘錄及協議，涵蓋經貿、投資、教育、旅遊和金融等多個領域。他有信心香港和越南將繼續加強多元合作，實現互利共贏。

李家超表示，特區政府已放寬越南公民來港探訪、就業及升讀大學的入境安排，並於今年三月推出新措施，為包括越南在內的東南亞國家聯盟國家受邀人士提供更便捷的入境安排，進一步促進香港和越南的人員往來，以及在經貿、專業服務及其他領域的交流合作。

李家超說，香港會積極擔當「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，全力發揮在「一國兩制」下內聯外通的獨特優勢，推動與越南在金融、創新科技、貿易，以及綠色和數字經濟等高增值領域的務實合作。"
CE meets Deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam (with photo),2025-12-19 19:00,2025-12-19 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900687.htm,"The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, met with the visiting Deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam, Mr Ho Duc Phoc, today (December 19) to exchange views on deepening co-operation between the two places. Also attending the meeting were the Deputy Financial Secretary, Mr Michael Wong, and the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui.

Mr Lee welcomed Mr Ho and his delegation to Hong Kong. Mr Lee noted that Vietnam is Hong Kong's sixth-largest trading partner with close economic and trade relations. In the first three quarters of this year, bilateral merchandise trade reached US$ 49 billion, representing a significant increase of 67 per cent compared to the same period last year. Last year, Mr Lee led a high-level business delegation to Vietnam, during which the two sides signed 30 Memoranda of Understanding and agreements covering various areas including trade, investment, education, tourism, and finance. He expressed confidence that Hong Kong and Vietnam will continue to strengthen multifaceted co-operation and achieve mutual benefit.

Mr Lee highlighted that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has relaxed immigration arrangements for Vietnamese citizens visiting, working, or pursuing post-secondary studies in Hong Kong. In March this year, new measures were introduced to provide more convenient immigration arrangements for invited persons from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries, including Vietnam. These measures will further promote people-to-people exchanges and co-operation between Hong Kong and Vietnam in trade, professional services, and other sectors.

Noting that Hong Kong will actively play its role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" and fully leverage its unique advantages of connecting the Mainland and the world under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Mr Lee said Hong Kong will promote pragmatic co-operation with Vietnam in high value-added areas such as finance, innovation and technology, trade, and the green and digital economy."

《政府租契續期條例》下刊登的第三份「續期公告」,2025-12-19 18:43,2025-12-19 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900630.htm,"地政總署今日（十二月十九日）根據《政府租契續期條例》（第648章）（《條例》）刊登第三份「續期公告」，按照《條例》給予六年通知的要求，涵蓋二○三二年內（即二○三二年一月一日至同年十二月三十一日）到期而沒有續期權利的「一般用途地契」（即一般住宅、商業、工業地契，下稱適用地契），公布這批涉及二十八個地段的地契全部獲得續期五十年。有關的「續期公告」已上載至地政總署網頁（www.landsd.gov.hk/tc/resources/gov-notices/lease-extension/ext_2025.html）。

按《條例》獲得續期的地契，包括這批28個地段的地契，無須補地價，只須每年繳納相當於有關土地應課差餉租值百分之三的地租。涉及的28個地段包括八個位於九龍及20個位於香港島的地段。

地政總署透過上述「續期公告」宣布獲續期的地契，其原有產權負擔、權益及權利（例如按揭）將自動過渡至續期的年期而不受影響，業權人無須辦理任何手續，亦不需與政府簽立續期文件或重新辦理按揭。地政總署已向相關的業主或業主立案法團發信，通知他們有關續期的安排。

"Third ""Extension Notice"" published under Extension of Government Leases Ordinance",2025-12-19 18:43,2025-12-19 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900633.htm,"The Lands Department published the third ""Extension Notice"" under the Extension of Government Leases Ordinance (Cap. 648) today (December 19) in accordance with the requirement under the Ordinance to give six years' prior notice, covering general purpose leases (GPLs) (i.e. general residential, commercial, industrial leases, hereafter ""applicable leases"") which expire in 2032 (i.e. from January 1 to December 31, 2032) and do not contain a right of renewal, to announce that all land leases of the 28 lots involved in this batch have been extended for a term of 50 years. The Extension Notice has been uploaded to the website of the Lands Department (www.landsd.gov.hk/en/resources/gov-notices/lease-extension/ext_2025.html).

Land leases extended under the Ordinance, including the leases of the 28 lots in this batch, do not require payment of additional premium but are subject to an annual payment of Government rent equivalent to 3 per cent of the rateable value of the relevant land. The 28 lots include eight located in Kowloon and 20 on Hong Kong Island.

Regarding the leases extended by the Lands Department through the above ""Extension Notice"", the encumbrances, interests and rights (such as mortgages) under the original lease will be carried forward to the extended lease term without being affected. Owners do not have to perform any procedures, nor are they required to execute lease extension documents with the Government or rearrange mortgages. The Lands Department has issued letters to the relevant owners or owners' corporations to inform them of the lease extension arrangements.

From January 2026 onwards, the Land Registry will add a remark in the respective land registers of applicable leases covered by the ""Extension Notices"" to enable the public to be informed of the extension of their leases. As a large number of properties are involved (Note), it is anticipated that the addition of remarks for the land lots involved in the three ""Extension Notices"" will be completed by the second quarter of next year.

A spokesperson for the Development Bureau said, ""The arrangement of extending land leases without having to execute a new contract under the Ordinance brings tremendous convenience to the public and businesses, effectively enhances the confidence of property owners and investors in the real estate market, and has received widespread support from various sectors of the community. The mechanism manifests the solid safeguards for the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong under the steadfast and successful implementation of the 'one country, two systems' principle.""

The Ordinance, which came into effect on July 5, 2024, establishes a standing statutory mechanism for handling lease extension matters for applicable leases which do not contain a right of renewal and expire on or after the effective date in batches. Together with the ""Extension Notices"" published on July 5, 2024, and December 27, 2024, the Government has extended leases expiring from July 5, 2024, to the end of 2032. The Government will publish the next ""Extension Notice"" by the end of 2026 for handling lease extension for applicable leases expiring in 2033, in accordance with the requirement under the Ordinance to give six years' prior notice.

Note: The three Extension Notices cover a total of 407 lots, involving about 11 500 properties."
EIA report for Development at Ngau Tam Mei Area approved with conditions,2025-12-19 18:33,2025-12-19 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900679.htm,"The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) announced, regarding the application submitted by the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) under the Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance (EIAO), that the Director of Environmental Protection (DEP) yesterday (December 18) approved the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report for the Development at Ngau Tam Mei Area (the Project) with conditions.

The Project is a designated project (DP) under Schedule 3 of the EIAO (i.e. an urban development or redevelopment project covering an area of more than 50 hectares). It includes two DPs under Schedule 2 of the EIAO requiring an environmental permit for its construction and operation, including the new distributor roads and part of the revitalisation of the Ngau Tam Mei Drainage Channel (NTMDC) and river diversion works.

The CEDD has exhibited the EIA report for public inspection from October 6 to November 4, 2025, in accordance with the EIAO. During the public inspection period, the EPD received a total of seven public comments. The EIA Subcommittee of the Advisory Council on the Environment (ACE) discussed in detail the EIA report and the public comments at its meeting on December 5, 2025. Subsequently, the ACE unanimously recommended that the EPD approved the EIA report with conditions and recommendations at its meeting on December 11, 2025.

A spokesperson for the EPD said that the DEP considers that, through the implementation of mitigation measures recommended in the EIA report, the Project will bring multiple environmental benefits to the area. These include addressing the existing adverse environmental impacts caused by scattered and disorganised brownfield operations within the project area, thereby enhancing land-use efficiency and improving the overall environmental quality of the district. Furthermore, by widening and revitalising the NTMDC into a multifunctional blue-green spine, the ecological value and function of the project area and its surroundings can be enhanced. In addition, through wetland compensation connecting nearby isolated wetlands, the Project will increase the overall ecological value of the area.

The spokesperson stressed that the EPD has thoroughly considered the requirements of the EIA Study Brief and the Technical Memorandum on Environmental Impact Assessment Process, comments on the environment and ecological impacts raised by the public during the public inspection period of the EIA report, suggestions and data given by green groups in respect of the EIA report (including the State of Hong Kong Biodiversity 2025 published by the WWF-Hong Kong), and the response from the CEDD during the ACE meeting, as well as comments and recommended conditions raised by the ACE on approving the EIA report. The EPD decided to approve the EIA report with conditions.

The approval conditions mainly include requiring the CEDD to:

(i) submit a detailed Habitat Creation and Management Plan (HCMP) as recommended in the EIA report to the DEP for approval no later than three months before the commencement of construction of the Project, and consult the Agricultural, fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD);

(ii) submit an Implementation Plan for Ecological Enhancement Features Design (IPEEFD) for the NTMDC to the DEP for approval no later than three months before commencement of construction of the Project, and consult relevant government departments, including the AFCD, the Drainage Services Department, and the Planning Department;

(iii) set up an Environmental Committee to provide professional and stakeholders' advice on the preparation of HCMP and IPEEFD, and on the effectiveness of the ecological mitigation/enhancement measures as recommended in the EIA report and the two approved abovementioned plans; and
â
(iv) submit a Bird-Friendly Design Guideline for buildings and noise barriers within the Project area to the DEP for approval before commencement of construction of the Project.

In addition, the CEDD shall review the progress of the implementation of various plans, the environmental monitoring results, and the effectiveness of ecological mitigation/enhancement measures. The EPD will continue to closely liaise with relevant government departments to follow up on the abovementioned approval conditions.

The approved EIA report and the approval conditions have been uploaded to the EPD's EIAO website (www.epd.gov.hk/eia). Members of the public may also visit the EIAO Register Office at 27th floor, Southorn Centre, Wan Chai, to inspect these documents."

"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, dengue fever and chikungunya fever",2025-12-19 18:00,2025-12-19 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900686.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (December 19) reported the latest situation of dengue fever (DF) and chikungunya fever (CF).

Dengue fever
----------------

  From December 12 to yesterday (December 18), the CHP recorded one imported DF case. The patient had travelled to Thailand during the incubation period.

  As of yesterday, 57 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. From January to July 2025, over four million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths have been reported in 97 countries/territories.

  DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India and Vietnam have each recorded over 100 000 cases so far this year; Malaysia and Thailand have each recorded over 40 000 cases; and Singapore has also recorded over 3 500 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded 3 579 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 21 cases were recorded in a week between December 1 and 7, with the highest number of cases recorded in Shantou and Chaozhou.

  Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHP'swebsite.

Chikungunya fever
-----------------------

  As of 5pm today, no new cases of CF had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported.

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. As the CHP and relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails recently, the CHP continues to appeal to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

  The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm. All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

  Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
  ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點亦普遍流行，印度尼西亞、印度和越南今年已分別錄得超過100 000萬宗個案，馬來西亞和泰國亦分別錄得超過四萬宗個案，新加坡則錄得超過3 500宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得3 579宗本地感染病例，其中21宗病例於十二月一日至七日的一周內錄得，以汕頭和潮州錄得的病例最多。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

基孔肯雅熱
—————
截至今日下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。本港今年累計錄得81宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

因應近期有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。鑑於中心與相關政府部門近期會在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。

中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。全港醫生及醫院應留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。

針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

37 landlords of subdivided units under regulated tenancies convicted of contravening relevant statutory requirements,2025-12-19 17:16,2025-12-19 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900653.htm,"  Thirty-seven landlords of subdivided units (SDUs), who contravened Part IVA of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7) (the Ordinance), pleaded guilty and were fined between $800 and $19,200, amounting to a total of $121,350, on December 5, December 12 and today (December 19) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. Since the Ordinance came into force, the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) has continuously strengthened enforcement actions and has prosecuted a total of 1 397 cases to date. Among the 1 024 cases dealt with by the court, all were successfully convicted, which involved a total of 897 SDU landlords, amounting to a total of $2,742,560 in fines. In addition, 373 cases are pending a hearing.

  The offences of these 37 landlords include (1) failing to submit a Notice of Tenancy (Form AR2) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation within 60 days after the term of the regulated tenancy commenced; and (2) requesting the tenant to pay money other than the types permitted under the Ordinance (including requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance).

  The RVD earlier discovered that the landlords failed to comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance. Upon a comprehensive investigation and evidence collection, the RVD prosecuted the landlords.

  A spokesman for the RVD reiterated that SDU landlords must comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance, including prohibiting landlords from doing any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of members of the tenant's household, with the intention of causing the tenant to give up occupation of the SDU; or requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance, and also reminded tenants of their rights under the Ordinance, including a four-year (i.e. two years plus two years) security of tenure. He also stressed that the RVD will continue to take resolute enforcement action against any contraventions of the Ordinance. Apart from following up on reported cases, the RVD has been adopting a multipronged approach to proactively identify, investigate and follow up on cases concerning landlords who are suspected of contravening the Ordinance. In particular, the RVD has been requiring landlords of regulated tenancies to provide information and reference documents of their tenancies for checking whether they have complied with the requirements of the Ordinance. If a landlord, without reasonable excuse, refuses to provide the relevant information or neglects the RVD's request, the landlord commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine at level 3 ($10,000) and to imprisonment for three months. Depending on the actual circumstances, and having regard to the information and evidence collected, the RVD will take appropriate actions on individual cases, including instigating prosecution against suspected contraventions of the Ordinance. In addition, the RVD has started a new round of publicity and education work to enhance public awareness about the key offences and penalties, emphasising that the RVD proactively checks whether landlords have committed the offences under the Ordinance.

  To help curb illegal acts as soon as possible, members of the public should report to the RVD promptly any suspected cases of contravening the relevant requirements. Reporting can be made through the telephone hotline (2150 8303), by email (enquiries@rvd.gov.hk), by fax (2116 4920), by post (15/F, Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, 303 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon), or in person (visiting the Tenancy Services Section office of the RVD at Room 3816-22, 38/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, and please call 2150 8303 to make an appointment). Furthermore, the RVD has provided a form (Form AR4) (www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/ar4.pdf) on its website to enable SDU tenants' reporting to the RVD.

  The RVD reminds that pursuant to the Ordinance, a regulated cycle of regulated tenancies is to comprise two consecutive regulated tenancies (i.e. the first-term tenancy and second-term tenancy) for an SDU, and the term of each regulated tenancy is two years. A tenant of a first-term tenancy for an SDU is entitled to be granted a second-term tenancy of the regulated cycle, thus enjoying a total of four years of security of tenure. The RVD has been issuing letters enclosing relevant information to the landlords and tenants concerned of regulated tenancies in batches, according to the expiry time of their first-term tenancies, to assist them in understanding the important matters pertaining to the second-term tenancy, and to remind them about the procedures that need to be followed about two months prior to the commencement of the purported second-term tenancy as well as their respective obligations and rights under the Ordinance. These landlords and tenants may also visit the dedicated page for the second-term tenancy on the RVD's website (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html) for the relevant information, including a concise guide, brochures, tutorial videos and frequently asked questions. The landlords and tenants concerned are also advised to familiarise themselves with the relevant statutory requirements and maintain close communication regarding the second-term tenancy for handling the matters properly and in a timely manner according to the Ordinance.

  For enquiries related to regulated tenancies, please call the telephone hotline (2150 8303) or visit the RVD's webpage (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/our_services/part_iva.html) for the relevant information.

37名分間單位規管租賃業主因違反相關法例規定而被定罪,2025-12-19 17:16,2025-12-19 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900649.htm,"37名分間單位業主因違反《業主與租客（綜合）條例》（第7章）第IVA部（《條例》）的相關規定，於十二月五日、十二月十二日及今日（十二月十九日）在東區裁判法院承認有關控罪，並被判處罰款介乎800元至19,200元，合計罰款共121,350元。自《條例》生效以來，差餉物業估價署（估價署）持續加強採取執法行動，至今已合共檢控1 397宗個案，而就法庭已處理的1 024宗個案，均全數成功定罪，共涉及897名分間單位業主，合計總罰款共2,742,560元，另有373宗個案則正等待進行聆訊。

該37名業主的罪行包括（一）沒有在規管租賃的租期開始後的60日內，向估價署署長提交租賃通知書（表格AR2）；及（二）要求租客支付不屬《條例》所准許的種類的款項（包括要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額）。

估價署於早前發現這些業主涉嫌違反《條例》的相關規定。經深入調查及搜集證據後，估價署向這些業主提出檢控。

估價署發言人重申，分間單位業主必須嚴格遵守《條例》下的相關規定，包括禁止業主刻意打擾租戶成員的安寧或舒適生活等，意圖使租客放棄佔用其分間單位；要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額；同時提醒租客在《條例》下所享有的權益，包括四年（即兩年加兩年）的租住權保障。他亦強調估價署會繼續堅決執法，打擊任何違例個案。估價署除了跟進舉報個案，亦一直以多管齊下的方式主動識別、調查及跟進有關業主涉嫌違反《條例》規定的個案。就此，估價署要求規管租賃的業主提供與租賃有關的資料及參考文件，以核實他們是否已遵從《條例》的規定。如業主無合理辯解而拒絕提供相關資料或忽略署方要求，即屬違法，最高可處第三級罰款（10,000元）及監禁三個月。因應實際情況和所蒐集的資料及證據，估價署會對個別個案採取適當行動，包括就涉嫌觸犯《條例》下罪行的個案提出檢控。此外，估價署已展開新一輪宣傳教育工作，加強宣傳《條例》下主要罪行及刑罰，並強調會主動審查業主有否觸犯《條例》下罪行。

為幫助盡早遏止違法行為，市民應盡快向估價署舉報涉嫌違規個案。舉報渠道包括電話熱線（2150 8303）、電郵（enquiries@rvd.gov.hk）、傳真（2116 4920）、郵寄（九龍長沙灣道303號長沙灣政府合署15樓）或親身到訪（香港灣仔告士打道7號入境事務大樓38樓3816-22室，估價署租務科辦公室，到訪前請先致電2150 8303預約）。此外，估價署亦已於其網頁提供一份表格（表格AR4）（www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/tc/forms/ar4.pdf），便利分間單位租客向估價署作出舉報。

估價署提醒，根據《條例》，規管租賃的規管周期，須由該分間單位的連續兩項規管租賃（即首期租賃及次期租賃）所組成，而每項規管租賃的租期為兩年。分間單位首期租賃的租客有權獲授予有關規管周期中的次期租賃，從而享有總共四年的租住權保障。估價署陸續按照首期租賃屆滿的時間，分批發信給相關規管租賃的業主和租客並夾附有關資訊，旨在協助他們了解次期租賃的重要事項，並提醒應在擬達成的次期租賃開始前約兩個月須遵從的程序，以及在《條例》下的相關義務和權益。有關業主及租客亦可瀏覽估價署網站內的次期租賃專頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html）的相關資料，包括「一圖看清」、小冊子、教學短片及常見問題。有關業主及租客亦應熟悉相關的法定要求，以及就次期租賃保持密切溝通，並按《條例》適切處理有關事宜。

如就規管租賃事宜有疑問，可致電電話熱線（2150 8303）或瀏覽估價署網頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/our_services/part_iva.html）內的相關資訊。"

十二月份第三批涵蓋兩個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及24個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下，大部分地區更為0%，顯示白紋伊蚊的分布情況並不廣泛。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十二月共三批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共50個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年十一月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這50個監察區中，47個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有三區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

​食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

  Among the third batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering two survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering 24 survey areas in December, all were below 10 per cent and most of the areas recorded a zero per cent, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive.

  The FEHD has so far released three batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in December 2025, covering 50 survey areas. Among these 50 survey areas, 47 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. November 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Three other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

  The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

  Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

  Speaking at a press conference, the Commissioner for Census and Statistics, Mr Leo Yu, remarked that the Census helps the Government to understand Hong Kong's demographic and socio-economic characteristics by providing vital statistical information for future planning and development. As a major step to modernise the mode of Hong Kong's population censuses, several re-engineering initiatives will be implemented from the 2026 Population Census to streamline and improve workflow. Every five years, the C&SD will randomly select only 10 per cent of households in Hong Kong for detailed enquiry. The remaining 90 per cent of households will not be required to fill out any questionnaire. In addition, while data collection will be conducted throughout the year, instead of concentrated within 1.5 months as in the past, selected households are only required to submit one questionnaire within the data collection period. Government administrative data will also be used more extensively to simplify the content of the questionnaire.

  Mr Yu emphasised that the C&SD strives to protect the data privacy of all persons and households. Information collected in the Census will be kept in strict confidence and only be used to compile aggregate statistics. Such information will not be disclosed to any unauthorised parties. All completed questionnaires will also be destroyed by December 31, 2027.

  About 10 per cent of households in Hong Kong (i.e. some 300 000 households) will be selected through random sampling to participate in the 2026 Population Census. The C&SD will issue notification letters in purple envelopes to the sampled households in batches starting from the end of this month.

  Sampled households (including owner-occupiers or tenants) who have received the notification letter can submit the required information via one of the following means:
(1) Completing the online questionnaire (by accessing the Online Questionnaire through scanning the QR code on the notification letter or visiting the website (oq.census2026.gov.hk)); or
(2) Conducting a telephone interview (by calling the Census Hotline at 18 2026).

  Sampled households are encouraged to complete the online Census questionnaire with ease by smartphones, desktop computers or mobile tablets. Census officers will also visit households with outstanding response and assist them in completing the questionnaire. When visiting households, census officers will wear a grey vest uniform, and carry an Enumerator Identity Card and a Census Officer Certificate of Identity issued by the C&SD for identification purposes.

  The C&SD reminds the public to be aware of scamming activities. Households will not be required to provide information on their Hong Kong identity card, bank accounts or credit cards in the Census. If households have not provided the C&SD with their contact information, the C&SD will not initiate calls, send emails or SMS messages to them. The caller ID ""18 2026"" or SMS sender ID ""#C&SD"" will be displayed when the C&SD calls or sends SMS messages to households in Hong Kong. To report suspected deception cases or verify the identity of census officers, members of the public should call the Census Hotline 18 2026.

  The Census Hotline will operate from 9 am to 10 pm from Monday to Friday (except public holidays) throughout the data collection period (from January to December 2026). Members of the public can call the Census Hotline at 18 2026 or visit the thematic webpage of the 2026 Population Census (www.census2026.gov.hk) for more information if they require assistance in completing the questionnaire.

  The Census is conducted under Section 9 of the Census and Statistics Ordinance (Cap. 316). All persons specified are obliged to provide the required information. It is an offence if any persons contravene the legal requirement for completing the Census questionnaire."

蝴蝶灣泳灘、青山灣泳灘及深水灣泳灘的紅潮目前仍未消退，其餘四宗紅潮已經消退，迄今並無收到相關的魚類死亡報告。

小組發言人說：「上述七宗紅潮由常見於本港水域的球形棕囊藻組成。外國文獻指該藻類可能產生泡沫，或會影響魚類。」

漁農自然護理署（漁護署）已提醒蘆荻灣、索罟灣及蒲苔魚類養殖區養魚戶留意魚排情況，並適時增氧。

紅潮的出現為自然現象，漁護署實施的浮游植物監測計劃將繼續主動監測紅潮出現的情況，以減低對本地海魚養殖業及市民可能造成的影響。"
二○二五年第三季在香港發行的支付卡的統計資料,2025-12-19 16:30,2025-12-19 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900549.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（十二月十九日）公布二○二五年第三季在香港發行的支付卡的統計資料。

支付卡統計資料（見附件）是根據八家支付卡計劃營運機構（註一）的信用卡及／或扣帳卡計劃所發行的信用卡及扣帳卡的季度資料編製而成。金管局在二○一○年六月開始按照國際慣例，公布支付卡的季度統計資料，以提高香港支付卡業務的透明度。

根據季度統計資料，於二○二五年第三季末，在市面流通的信用卡總數（註二）為2 508萬張，按季上升10.0%，按年上升23.6%。信用卡交易量及金額（包括零售銷售及現金貸款）（註三）容易受季節因素及整體經濟環境影響，走勢較為波動。在二○二五年第三季，信用卡總交易量為38 261萬宗，較上一季增加6.2%，較二○二四年同期則增加16.3%。二○二五年第三季的信用卡交易總額為2,856億港元，較上一季增加6.4%，與二○二四年同期比較增加14.8%。交易總額當中，1,733億港元（60.7%）為香港消費，1,031億港元（36.1%）為海外消費，91億港元 （3.2%）為現金貸款。

扣帳卡方面，由於同一張扣帳卡可包含多於一個扣帳卡品牌，因此難以計算在市面流通的扣帳卡總數。正如信用卡交易的情形一樣，涉及零售銷售及支付帳單的扣帳卡交易量及金額（註四）亦會受季節因素影響。在二○二五年第三季，涉及零售銷售及支付帳單的扣帳卡總交易量按季減少9.6%至5 231萬宗，總額則按季減少5.6%至627億港元。與二○二四年同期比較，二○二五年第三季的扣帳卡總交易量減少3.2%，總額減少8.3%。

註一：支付卡統計資料是根據認可機構及非認可機構在八家支付卡計劃營運機構（卡營運機構）的信用卡及／或扣帳卡計劃下、在香港發行的信用卡及扣帳卡的資料編製而成。該八家卡營運機構為美國運通國際股份有限公司、Discover Financial Services （Hong Kong） Limited、易辦事（香港）有限公司、JCB International （Asia） Ltd.、銀聯通寶有限公司、MasterCard Asia/Pacific Pte. Ltd.、銀聯國際有限公司、及Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited。
註二：在香港發行的信用卡每張僅包含一個信用卡品牌。在市面流通的信用卡總數是指根據卡營運機構（不包括易辦事及銀聯通寶，因這兩家機構沒有營運信用卡計劃）的信用卡計劃，在香港發行的信用卡（即具備信貸功能的卡）總數。部分信用卡亦具備扣帳卡功能，即有關信用卡可透過直接從持卡人銀行帳戶中扣帳的方式購物／付款或從自動櫃員機提款。
註三：信用卡交易的總宗數及總額，是指經由根據卡營運機構（不包括易辦事及銀聯通寶）的信用卡計劃在香港發行的信用卡的帳戶進行的交易的總宗數及總額。由二○一五年三月開始，已提供信用卡零售銷售交易有關香港／海外消費的細分數據。
註四：扣帳卡交易的總宗數及總額，指透過自持卡人銀行帳戶扣帳的方式進行的交易的總宗數及總額。在八家卡營運機構中，部分沒有營運扣帳卡計劃。合併計算信用卡零售銷售數字與扣帳卡零售銷售與支付帳單數字時要格外審慎，因為將兩者合併可能會出現重複計算的情況。"
Red tides sighted,2025-12-19 16:30,2025-12-19 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900604.htm,"  Seven red tides were sighted during the past week, the Inter-departmental Red Tide Working Group reported today (December 19).

  On December 15, staff of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department spotted six red tides at Butterfly Beach, Cafeteria New Beach, Cafeteria Old Beach, Golden Beach, Castle Peak Beach and Kadoorie Beach in Tuen Mun, respectively. On December 17, another red tide was spotted at Deep Water Bay Beach in Southern District, Hong Kong Island.

  The red tides at Butterfly Beach, Castle Peak Beach and Deep Water Bay Beach still persist, while the other four red tides have dissipated. No associated fish deaths have been reported as of today.

  A spokesman for the working group said, ""All seven red tides were formed by Phaeocystis globosa, which is commonly found in Hong Kong waters. According to literature overseas, the algal species can produce foam that may affect fish.""

  The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) urged mariculturists at the Lo Tik Wan, Sok Kwu Wan and Po Toi fish culture zones to monitor the situation closely and increase aeration where necessary.

  Red tide is a natural phenomenon. The AFCD's proactive phytoplankton monitoring programme will continue to monitor red tide occurrences to minimise the impact on the mariculture industry and the public."

2026 Population Census to commence in January next year,2025-12-19 16:30,2025-12-19 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900315.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) announced today (December 19) that the 2026 Population Census will be conducted from January 1 to December 31, 2026.

  Speaking at a press conference, the Commissioner for Census and Statistics, Mr Leo Yu, remarked that the Census helps the Government to understand Hong Kong's demographic and socio-economic characteristics by providing vital statistical information for future planning and development. As a major step to modernise the mode of Hong Kong's population censuses, several re-engineering initiatives will be implemented from the 2026 Population Census to streamline and improve workflow. Every five years, the C&SD will randomly select only 10 per cent of households in Hong Kong for detailed enquiry. The remaining 90 per cent of households will not be required to fill out any questionnaire. In addition, while data collection will be conducted throughout the year, instead of concentrated within 1.5 months as in the past, selected households are only required to submit one questionnaire within the data collection period. Government administrative data will also be used more extensively to simplify the content of the questionnaire.

  Mr Yu emphasised that the C&SD strives to protect the data privacy of all persons and households. Information collected in the Census will be kept in strict confidence and only be used to compile aggregate statistics. Such information will not be disclosed to any unauthorised parties. All completed questionnaires will also be destroyed by December 31, 2027.

  About 10 per cent of households in Hong Kong (i.e. some 300 000 households) will be selected through random sampling to participate in the 2026 Population Census. The C&SD will issue notification letters in purple envelopes to the sampled households in batches starting from the end of this month.

  Sampled households (including owner-occupiers or tenants) who have received the notification letter can submit the required information via one of the following means:
(1) Completing the online questionnaire (by accessing the Online Questionnaire through scanning the QR code on the notification letter or visiting the website (oq.census2026.gov.hk)); or
(2) Conducting a telephone interview (by calling the Census Hotline at 18 2026).

  Sampled households are encouraged to complete the online Census questionnaire with ease by smartphones, desktop computers or mobile tablets. Census officers will also visit households with outstanding response and assist them in completing the questionnaire. When visiting households, census officers will wear a grey vest uniform, and carry an Enumerator Identity Card and a Census Officer Certificate of Identity issued by the C&SD for identification purposes.

  The C&SD reminds the public to be aware of scamming activities. Households will not be required to provide information on their Hong Kong identity card, bank accounts or credit cards in the Census. If households have not provided the C&SD with their contact information, the C&SD will not initiate calls, send emails or SMS messages to them. The caller ID ""18 2026"" or SMS sender ID ""#C&SD"" will be displayed when the C&SD calls or sends SMS messages to households in Hong Kong. To report suspected deception cases or verify the identity of census officers, members of the public should call the Census Hotline 18 2026.

  The Census Hotline will operate from 9 am to 10 pm from Monday to Friday (except public holidays) throughout the data collection period (from January to December 2026). Members of the public can call the Census Hotline at 18 2026 or visit the thematic webpage of the 2026 Population Census (www.census2026.gov.hk) for more information if they require assistance in completing the questionnaire.

  The Census is conducted under Section 9 of the Census and Statistics Ordinance (Cap. 316). All persons specified are obliged to provide the required information. It is an offence if any persons contravene the legal requirement for completing the Census questionnaire."

Statistics of Stored Value Facilities schemes issued by SVF licensees,2025-12-19 16:30,2025-12-19 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900542.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published today (December 19) statistics on Stored Value Facilities (SVF) schemes issued by SVF licensees for the third quarter of 2025.

The SVF scheme statistics (see Annex) include quarterly data on SVF schemes issued by the SVF licensees of the relevant periods.

According to the quarterly statistics, the total number of SVF accounts in use (Note 1) was 83.4 million at the end of Q3/2025, representing a 0.8 per cent increase from the previous quarter. The total number of SVF transactions was around 2.1 billion in Q3/2025, or 0.5per cent higher than the previous quarter. The total value of SVF transactions was HK$268.9 billion in Q3/2025, representing a 5.9per cent decrease from the previous quarter. Of the total transaction value, HK$45.2 billion was related to point-of-sale spending payment, HK$30.6 billion in online spending payment, HK$16.5 billion in P2P funds transfer, HK$65.4 billion in withdrawal and HK$111.2 billion in add value. The total float and SVF deposit (Note 2) was HK$20.7 billion at the end of Q3/2025, 1.7per cent higher than the previous quarter.

As compared with the end of Q3/2024, the total number of SVF accounts in use at the end of Q3/2025 was up by 7.7per cent, and the total float and SVF deposit was up by 11.8per cent. The total number and value of SVF transactions during Q3/2025 were up by 3.8per cent and 13.4per cent year-on-year respectively.

Statistics of payment cards issued in Hong Kong for third quarter 2025,2025-12-19 16:30,2025-12-19 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900553.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published today (December 19) statistics of payment cards issued in Hong Kong for the third quarter of 2025.

The payment card statistics (see Annex) include quarterly data on credit and debit cards issued in Hong Kong under the credit and/or debit card schemes of the eight payment card scheme operators (Note 1). The HKMA began to publish the payment card statistics on a quarterly basis in June 2010 to enhance transparency of the payment card industry in Hong Kong, in line with international practice.

According to the quarterly statistics, the total number of credit cards in circulation (Note 2) was 25.08 million by the end of Q3/2025. The figure represents a 10.0 per cent increase from the previous quarter and a 23.6per centincrease from the previous year. The number and value of credit card transactions (including retail sales and cash advances) (Note 3) are susceptible to seasonal factors and the general economic environment, making the trends more prone to fluctuation. The total number of credit card transactions was 382.61 million for Q3/2025, representing a 6.2per centincrease from the previous quarter and a 16.3per cent increase from the same period in 2024. The total value of credit card transactions was HK$285.6 billion for Q3/2025, representing a 6.4per cent increase from the previous quarter and a 14.8per centincrease from the same period in 2024. Of the total transaction value, HK$173.3 billion (60.7per cent) was related to retail spending in Hong Kong, HK$103.1 billion (36.1per cent) in retail spending overseas and HK$9.1 billion (3.2per cent) in cash advances.

The total number of debit cards in circulation is not available due to overlapping of debit card brands in a single card. Like the number and value of credit card transactions, the number and value of debit card transactions in relation to retail sales and bills payments (Note 4) are also affected by seasonal factors. On a quarterly basis, the total number of debit card transactions in relation to retail sales and bills payments decreased by 9.6per centto 52.31 million while the total value decreased by 5.6per cent to HK$62.7 billion in Q3/2025. When compared to the same period in 2024, the total number decreased by 3.2per centand the total value dropped by 8.3per cent in Q3/2025.

Note 1:The payment card statistics are compiled from data on credit and debit cards issued in Hong Kong by both authorized institutions (AIs) and non-authorized institutions (non-AIs) under the credit and/or debit card schemes of the eight payment card scheme operators (""the card operators""). The card operators, in alphabetical order, are American Express International, Inc., Discover Financial Services (Hong Kong) Limited, EPS Company (Hong Kong) Limited (EPSCO), JCB International (Asia) Ltd, Joint Electronic Teller Services Ltd. (JETCO), MasterCard Asia/Pacific Pte. Ltd., UnionPay International Co. Ltd and Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited.

Note 2: A credit card issued in Hong Kong only carries one credit card brand. The total number of credit cards in circulation refers to the total number of credit cards (i.e. cards with a credit function) issued in Hong Kong under the credit card schemes of card operators (but excluding EPSCO and JETCO, which do not operate a credit card scheme). Some of these credit cards carry debit card functions, i.e. the credit card can be used for making purchases/payments or cash withdrawal at ATMs through directly debiting cardholders' bank accounts.

Note 3: The total number/value of credit card transactions refer to the total number/value of transactions made via credit card accounts of credit cards issued in Hong Kong under the credit card schemes of card operators (excluding EPSCO and JETCO). Starting from March 2015, a Hong Kong/overseas spending breakdown of credit card retail sales transactions is provided.

Note 4: The total number/value of debit card transactions in relation to retail sales/bill payments refers to the total number/value of those transactions made via debiting cardholders' bank accounts. Some of the eight card operators do not operate a debit card scheme. Care should be exercised in combining the credit card retail sales figures and the debit card retail sales/bills payment figures because of the possibility of double counting."
Statistics on persons engaged and vacancies for September 2025,2025-12-19 16:30,2025-12-19 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900316.htm,"According to the statistics on persons engaged and vacancies (formerly known as employment and vacancies statistics) released today (December 19) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), total number of persons engaged in the private sector surveyed decreased by 0.4% or 11 300 persons in September 2025 compared with a year earlier. The total number of vacancies was 51 450, representing a decrease of 23% or 15 010 over the preceding year.

Persons engaged statistics

In September 2025, the selected industries as a whole engaged 2 710 200 persons. The import and export trade engaged 342 700 persons, followed by professional and business services (excluding cleaning and similar services) engaging 314 800 persons, financing and insurance 238 500 persons, retail trade 230 000 persons, and food and beverage services 217 500 persons.

Movements in the number of persons engaged in different surveyed industries varied when compared with a year earlier. Increases were mainly observed in the industries of human health services (3.6% or 5 700 persons), financing and insurance (3.5% or 8 000 persons), and manufacturing (2.1% or 1 600 persons). On the other hand, the number of persons engaged decreased mainly in the industries of construction sites (manual workers only) (-6.2% or -7 600 persons), import and export trade (-3.7% or -13 000 persons), retail trade (-3.0% or -7 100 persons), and cleaning and similar services (-2.6% or -2 200 persons). Number of persons engaged for selected major industries are shown in Table 1.

Vacancies statistics

Among the 51 450 private sector vacancies in September 2025, 5 860 were from the industry of financing and insurance, 5 260 from education, 5 120 from professional and business services (excluding cleaning and similar services), 4 830 from human health services, and 4 230 from residential care and social work services.

On the other hand, vacancies increased in the industries of financing and insurance (860 or 17%), and information and communications (260 or 11%). Job vacancies figures for selected major industries are shown in Table 2.

Analysed by major occupation category, private sector vacancies were observed mainly in the categories of service and sales workers (16 920 vacancies), professionals (9 580 vacancies), and associate professionals (9 340 vacancies). Job vacancies figures by major occupation category are shown in Table 3.

Seasonally adjusted statistics

For discerning the latest trend in the number of persons engaged and vacancies in the private sector, it is useful to look at changes over a three-month period in the respective seasonally adjusted figures. Compared with June 2025, the seasonally adjusted total number of persons engaged and total vacancies in the surveyed industries increased by 0.2% and decreased by 1.7% respectively in September 2025. The changes over three-month periods in the seasonally adjusted series of persons engaged and vacancies are shown in Table 4.

Other information

The above statistics on persons engaged and vacancies were obtained from the Quarterly Survey of Employment and Vacancies and the Quarterly Employment Survey of Construction Sites conducted by the C&SD. In the former survey, some economic activities (e.g. those dominated by self-employment, including taxi operators and hawkers) are not covered. Therefore, the respective figures for persons engaged and vacancies relate only to those selected industries included in the survey. In the latter survey on construction sites, the number of persons engaged and vacancies relate to manual workers only.

A detailed breakdown of the above statistics is published in the following reports:
""Quarterly Report of Persons Engaged and Vacancies Statistics, September 2025"" (formerly known as ""Quarterly Report of Employment and Vacancies Statistics"")

Ms Maria Tam (Deputy Secretary-General of the Hong Kong Coalition), Professor Herman Hu (Chairman of Friday Culture Limited), Mr Nick Chan (Director of the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

A very good afternoon. I am very grateful to have the opportunity to speak at the 5th International Forum, co-organised by Friday Culture Limited, the Hong Kong Coalition and the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre. I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to the organisers for their ongoing efforts in hosting this event.

  This year's theme, ""Problem-Solving City: Hong Kong as a Disputes Resolver, Transnational Connector and Cultural Bridge"", aptly captures one of Hong Kong's unique roles and is especially relevant at a time of global uncertainty. As economies and communities around the world navigate post-pandemic recovery, rapid digitalisation, and shifting geopolitical landscapes, the ability to connect, mediate, and build trust across boundaries is essential.

  Hong Kong has long been recognised as a premier global hub for dispute resolution, supported by a robust legal framework, world-class institutions and professional talent, as well as an independent and efficient judiciary. The establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) Headquarters in Hong Kong further reinforces Hong Kong's status as a centre for peaceful dispute resolution. As the world's first intergovernmental legal institution dedicated to resolving international disputes through mediation, the IOMed provides an additional avenue for handling disputes between states, between a state and foreign nationals, as well as international commercial disputes.

  On the other hand, Hong Kong continues to serve as a transnational connector and cultural bridge, linking East and West through its strategic location, multilingual environment, and active participation in initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative. This blend of Chinese heritage and international vision enables the city to act as a gateway connecting the Chinese Mainland with the world, fostering mutual understanding and forging enduring partnerships with the global community.

  Today's programme, with its two engaging panels: ""Mediating Disputes in Sports"" and ""Setting and Harmonising Standards for Web 3.0"", offers a timely opportunity for thoughtful exchange. Please allow me to offer a few very brief observations ahead of the discussions by the panellists.

Mediating disputes in sports

  With the hosting of competition events during the 15th National Games and the opening of the Kai Tak Sports Park, Hong Kong's sports sector is experiencing continuous development. As the industry grows, so does the need for effective dispute resolution services tailored to address sports-related issues, from commercial and contractual disputes to competition and governance issues.

  A dedicated and streamlined mechanism for resolving sports-related disputes is pivotal to advancing Hong Kong's sports development. Delays in resolution can derail a sportsman's career or disrupt the operation of a sports organisation. A reliable and effective dispute resolution framework will not only safeguard the interests of the sportsmen and sports bodies but also increase confidence, stability and professionalism across the sector. As an international legal and dispute resolution services centre, Hong Kong is well positioned to become a trusted hub for sports dispute resolution.

  Globally, the sports dispute resolution landscape has made considerable progress. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) headquartered in Switzerland, with its global network of arbitrators and mediators, provides structured mechanisms for adjudicating sports disputes efficiently and transparently. On the Chinese Mainland, the establishment of the China Commission of Arbitration for Sport (CCAS) under the revised Sports Law represents another significant step, laying the foundation for a comprehensive sports dispute resolution system in our country. These experiences offer valuable reference points for Hong Kong.

  During my duty visit to Europe earlier this year, I had the opportunity to visit the office of the French National and Olympic Sports Committee (CNOSF) and meet with representatives from the Chamber of Arbitration for Sport and the Conference of Conciliators of the CNOSF. These exchanges offered valuable insights into the committee's services in sports arbitration and conciliation and highlighted the importance of nurturing a collaborative culture, in which dialogue and mutual understanding form the foundation of effective sports dispute resolution. This experience has further reinforced my belief in the importance of fostering a similar culture of structured and proactive resolution in Hong Kong.

  The Hong Kong Government has indeed been proactive in developing a dedicated sports dispute resolution system. The Department of Justice (DoJ) worked closely with the sports and legal communities to establish the Pilot Scheme on Sports Dispute Resolution, which was a key policy initiative under the Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address. I am glad that the Pilot Scheme was formally launched about a week ago on December 11. The Pilot Scheme incorporates a ""mediation first, arbitration next"" process, thus reinforcing the efficacy of mediation for resolving sports disputes. We are confident that mediation is particularly fitting given its speed and cost efficiency, its capacity to preserve relationships, as well as its potential to deliver creative and practical solutions.

  In fact, we consider that the said initiative goes beyond a policy measure - fundamentally speaking, it is about culture building. To work towards this direction, the DoJ has long been committed to promoting the wider use of mediation in Hong Kong and deepening the mediation culture, and we see significant value in extending this to the sports sector. Please rest assured that we will continue to engage in dialogue and collaboration with partners across sectors to raise awareness and nurture talent in sports dispute resolution through educational programmes and promotional events, with the goal of cultivating a healthy and sustainable sports ecosystem grounded in knowledge, professionalism and trust.

  Today's panel on ""Mediating Disputes in Sports"" brings together sports industry leaders, elite athletes and legal experts to share perspectives on the growing importance of mediation in sports. Their insights will shed light on how a robust, fair and efficient dispute resolution system can benefit our sporting community, thereby paving the way for Hong Kong to become a trusted hub for sports dispute resolution.

Setting and harmonising standards for Web 3.0

  The second panel discussion is about setting and harmonising standards for Web 3.0. Web 3.0 represents the latest generation of the Internet, characterised by decentralisation, blockchain technology and user sovereignty. With Web 3.0, users have greater control over their data and transactions, fostering trust and transparency through cryptographic mechanisms. Coupled with the development of artificial intelligence, Web 3.0 has opened up new applications and opportunities to various sectors, including the legal and dispute resolution industry.

  Web 3.0 technologies enhance enforceability and transparency in contractual obligations and create further synergy when integrated with AI. Take smart contracts as an example. Smart contracts are digital agreements stored on a blockchain, and they execute automatically. They often incorporate key contractual clauses such as dispute resolution and governing law clauses. AI smart contracts can even analyse data, adapt to different contexts and improve accuracy in future decision-making when executing the contracts. Electronic evidence is another good example. Electronic evidence can be verified using blockchain timestamping. AI can supplement it by accurately identifying, extracting and analysing digital evidence, hence ensuring the integrity and admissibility of electronic evidence. It is therefore essential for legal professionals to understand the implications and embrace these technologies to enhance efficiency in their practice.

  The Government has been proactive in supporting the development of Web 3.0 in Hong Kong. In 2022, the Policy Statement on Development of Virtual Assets in Hong Kong was issued by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau to set out the policy stance and approach towards developing a vibrant sector and ecosystem for virtual assets in Hong Kong. Version 2.0 of the Statement was then released in June this year. The Task Force on Promoting Web3 Development, chaired by the Financial Secretary, was also established in 2023 to provide the Government with recommendations on the sustainable and responsible development of Web 3.0. With all the efforts made as aforementioned, the Stablecoins Ordinance (Cap. 656) came into effect on August 1, 2025, with a view to facilitating the sustainable development of the stablecoin and digital asset ecosystem in Hong Kong by introducing a licensing regime for fiat-referenced stablecoin issuers.

  The DoJ has also actively promoted the use of Web 3.0 technologies in the legal and dispute resolution industry. With our support, eBRAM International Online Dispute Resolution Centre (eBRAM) was established to provide online dispute resolution (ODR) services. Since May 2022, eBRAM has developed a series of ODR platforms, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ODR Platform, an online arbitration platform, an online mediation platform, and the Deal-Making Portal, so as to facilitate business transactions and access to justice. In particular, eBRAM's Deal-Making Portal provides a set of comprehensive tools for cross-border dispute resolution and deal-making using Web 3.0 technologies such as smart contracts.

  Earlier this year, we also set up the Consultation Group on LawTech Development, which will be responsible for giving advices on the formulation of policies and measures regarding lawtech. With the support of the Consultation Group, we have organised four rounds of the LexGoTech Roundtables Series and released a report on the discussions. To further demonstrate our efforts on legal technology development, we organised the inaugural Hong Kong LawTech Fest earlier this month as part of the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025.

  Apart from promoting the integration of technology and AI in the legal sector, we are taking on a pivotal role in building the broader legal regime for AI governance as mentioned in the 2025 Policy Address. We will co-ordinate an interdepartmental working group to co-ordinate the responsible bureaux to review the legislation needed to complement the wider application of AI. This initiative aims to provide a facilitative yet properly controlled legal environment for the development of AI.

  Furthermore, the combination of Web 3.0 and AI offers opportunities for resolving legal disputes by enhancing efficiency and lowering costs. I am confident that the panel will share more insights on why and how the standards for Web 3.0 should be set and harmonised so as to strengthen Hong Kong's position as a global hub for legal and technological innovation.

  In closing, I wish to express my heartfelt appreciation again to all organisers, speakers and participants for their dedication to advancing dialogue and innovation. The strength of Hong Kong lies not only in our institutions and infrastructure but, more importantly, also in our people - their openness, professionalism and shared belief in the value of co-operation. Together, we will continue to build a city that connects cultures, bridges differences and contributes meaningfully to the global peace and development.

  May I wish you all a very constructive forum this afternoon."

Court makes review decision on sentencing for violating occupational safety and health legislation,2025-12-19 16:20,2025-12-19 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900559.htm,"  âRegarding the sentencing in a fatal industrial accident, the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (December 19) handed down a review decision, accepting the prosecution's application for review of an earlier court sentence and increasing the fines imposed on the employer.
  
  The case involved a fatal accident that occurred on March 14, 2024, at a warehouse in Sandy Ridge, New Territories. While a worker was operating a fork-lift truck for unloading of wooden battens from the trailer of a truck, a bundle of wooden battens fell from the trailer and struck another worker. The concerned worker sustained an injury and passed away on the same day.
  
  Kinform Timber Company Limited, being the employer of the fork-lift truck operator, was prosecuted by the Labour Department (LD) for violation of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, and was fined $120,000 at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts on January 21, 2025.
  
  After the sentencing, the prosecution filed a review application with the court regarding the sentence imposed on the relevant employer. The review hearing was brought up today before the Fanling Magistrates' Courts. The fine imposed on Kinform Timber Company Limited was increased to $160,000.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that the ruling will disseminate a strong message to all employers that they have to protect workers' safety and health at work in accordance with the laws. The prosecution will continue to pay attention to court rulings and will file review or appeal applications for cases where the sentences are manifestly inadequate and/or wrong in principle."

醫院管理局啓動服務需求高峰期特別措施,2025-12-19 16:00,2025-12-19 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900490.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）今日（十二月十九日）公布，公立醫院會在周日（十二月二十一日）啓動服務需求高峰期特別措施。醫管局預計，公立醫院服務需求將於聖誕節和元旦假期增加，屆時會密切監察各醫院的運作情況。

醫管局總行政經理（聯網運作）李立業醫生說︰「公立醫院會採取特別措‍施應對急症室及住院服務需求上升，包括加強人手和病床，亦會透過醫院指揮中心協調出院流程，支援入院、出院及轉‍院等各項安排，務求讓病人更快得到適切的治療和盡量騰出病床接收新‍入院病人。公立醫院亦會減少長假期後的內科非緊急入院數目及按需要於長假期期間加開髖關節骨折手術節‍數。此外，社區老人評估小組將加強對安老院舍的支援，包括增加探訪安老院舍，以減低院舍病人前往急症室求診的壓力及減少病人非必要住‍院。」

醫‍管‍局亦會在服務需求高峰期期間推行急症室特別退款安排，以方便病情穩定的病人彈性選擇其他就診安排。病人在急症室等候醫生診症期間，如欲選‍擇轉到其他醫療機構求診，可於登記處直接向當值職員提出申請退回已繳交的急症室收費。「HA Go」會員亦可透過醫管局流動應用程式「HA Go」提交申請。有關安排只適用於未接受醫生診症的病人，並須在登記後24‍小時內提出申請，合資格的申請者將會在大約一個月內透過郵寄支票、信用卡或電子錢包方式收到退款。有關特別退款安排將會實行至十二月三十一日，並會在明年一‍月一日由公營醫療收費改革的急症室恆常退款機制取‍代。

為應對市民在聖誕長假期的求診需要及減輕急症室的服務壓力，醫管局已加強家庭醫學門診服務，聖誕假期期間（十二月二十五日及二十六日）將有18‍間家庭醫學診所提供公眾假期家庭醫學門診服務（詳見下表）。求診人士可透過電話預約系統或「HA Go」流動應用程式內的「預約家庭醫學診所」功能，預約診症時間。

18區中醫診所暨教研中心（中醫診所）亦將於十二月二十四、二十七及二十九日加強政府資助中醫門診服務，應對市民的求診需要。求診人士可於中醫診所的服務時間致電或使用「18區中醫診所」流動應用程式（適用於曾登記使用18區中醫診所服務的求診人士）預約服務。市民亦可瀏覽醫管局中醫動網頁（cmk.ha.org.hk/christmas-2025）獲取有關中醫服務的最新資訊。

醫管局呼籲非緊急的病人應避免使用急症室，盡量向家庭醫學診所、私家醫生及私家醫院24小時門診求診，以減輕公立醫院急症室的壓力。市民可瀏覽醫務衞生局基層醫療指南www.pcdirectory.gov.hk。醫務衞生局亦已整合全港18區將在二○二五年聖誕節及二○二六年元旦假期應診的私家醫院、醫療機構、家庭醫生和中醫診所的資料，並與發展局空間數據辦事處和地政總署合作，將相關醫院及診所的資料（包括地址、電話及應診時段等）上載至網上平台（www.map.gov.hk/gm/s/hhbclinic/all?lg=tc），供市民參‍考。

鑑於現時本港仍處於流感季節，醫管局提醒市民在假日期間注意個人及環境衞生，避免傳播疾病。市民如出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上口罩及盡快求醫。同時，合資格人士應及早接種流感及新冠疫苗，特別是高風險群組人‍士，減低自己和家人的感染機會，並降低感染後可能引致重症甚至死亡的風險。

"Speech by SFST at International Forum ""Problem-Solving City: Hong Kong as a Disputes Resolver"" (English only)",2025-12-19 16:00,2025-12-19 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900323.htm,"Following is the pre-recorded video speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the International Forum ""Problem-Solving City: Hong Kong as a Disputes Resolver"" today (December 19):

Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests,

It is a great honour to address you for this esteemed forum, ""Problem-Solving City: Hong Kong as a Disputes Resolver"". I extend my sincere thanks to the organisers - the Hong Kong Coalition, Friday Culture Limited, and the AALCO (Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization) Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre - for convening this timely event. While I am not with you at the event physically due to other commitments, I know you are gathering at the historic Former French Mission Building, and it is a symbol of Hong Kong's rich heritage and forward-looking spirit, reminding us of our city's unique ability to bridge traditions and innovations. I also commend my colleague, the Secretary for Justice, for his insightful keynote earlier, which set a strong foundation for discussions on dispute resolution. I am delighted to share the Government's vision and policy measures with you that align with the forum's key themes, particularly in fostering standards and resolutions in emerging sectors such as Web 3.0 and digital assets.

Hong Kong has long been recognised as a global problem solver, leveraging our robust legal framework and international connectivity to resolve disputes across borders and industries. This role extends beyond traditional arbitration and mediation into the financial and technological realms, where rapid evolution demands proactive governance. The forum's focus on mediating disputes in sports and setting standards for Web 3.0 resonates deeply with the Government's commitment to creating an ecosystem that promotes fairness, innovation, and sustainable growth. In sports, effective mediation ensures that conflicts do not hinder athletic progress or international collaboration. Similarly, in the digital economy, harmonising standards is essential to mitigate risks, build trust, and resolve potential disputes before they escalate. Our policies are designed to position Hong Kong not only as a dispute resolver but as a proactive architect of global standards, ensuring that economic activities thrive in a regulated yet dynamic environment.

Central to this vision is our dedication to developing a trusted and innovative digital asset ecosystem. In June this year, my bureau issued the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong, building upon the foundational measures from the inaugural statement from 2022. This 2.0 statement reinforces our commitment to establishing Hong Kong as a global hub for digital asset innovation. It introduces the ""LEAP"" framework, which emphasises Legal and regulatory streamlining, Expanding tokenised products, Advancing use cases through cross-sectoral collaboration, and developing People and partnerships. This approach directly addresses the need for harmonised standards in Web 3.0, where decentralised technologies like blockchain and tokenisation present both opportunities and challenges in dispute resolution.

One of the cornerstones of our regulatory enhancements is the Stablecoins Ordinance, which came into effect on August 1 this year. This legislation establishes a licensing regime for issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins, ensuring that any entity issuing such assets in Hong Kong, or marketing them to our public, obtains approval from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Guided by the principle of ""same activity, same risks, same regulation"", we adopt a risk-based approach that aligns with international standards while reflecting local circumstances. The HKMA's stablecoin issuer sandbox, launched last year, has allowed institutions from diverse sectors - including banking and technology - to test business models in a controlled environment. By end-September this year, we received 36 licence applications from a broad spectrum of applicants, and we anticipate granting a handful of licenses in early next year, prioritising robust reserve management, price stabilisation, and anti-money laundering measures. These steps not only protect investors but also facilitate the resolution of potential disputes by embedding clear compliance pathways, reducing ambiguities that could lead to conflicts in transactions.

Furthermore, we are advancing regulatory regimes for digital asset dealing and custodian service providers. Following public consultations, my bureau, in collaboration with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), are formulating details for licensing regimes, with a bill targeted for introduction to the Legislative Council next year. This comprehensive framework will cover key nodes in the digital asset industry, balancing risk management with innovation. In parallel, the licensing regime for digital asset trading platforms, operational since June 2023 under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, has seen 11 platforms licensed. Recent circulars from the SFC allow these platforms to share global order books and expand offerings, enhancing liquidity and connectivity. Such frameworks and measures ensure that disputes arising from trading or custody are resolved efficiently through established regulatory channels, reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a dispute resolver in the digital space.

Tokenisation of real-world assets is another pivotal area where our policies promote harmonisation and dispute prevention. The SFC's circulars in November 2023 and the HKMA's guidance in February last year provide clarity on tokenised securities and custodial services, enabling banks and intermediaries to engage safely. Last year, we authorised the first retail tokenised gold product and five tokenised money market funds, with assets under management reaching $4 billion in August this year. The Project Ensemble Sandbox, launched by the HKMA in August last year with the SFC as a key partner, tests tokenisation use cases, paving the way for innovative financial infrastructure. These initiatives extend to Web 3.0 by standardising tokenisation processes, which can minimise disputes over asset ownership or valuations through transparent, blockchain-based records.

Our efforts also encompass intermediaries providing digital asset services. A joint circular from the SFC and the HKMA was updated in 2023 allowing retail access to dealing, advisory, and asset management services. We have pioneered the listing of digital asset futures ETFs (exchange-traded fund) in December 2022, spot ETFs in April last year, and an inverse product in July last year. The SFC's ""ASPIRe"" roadmap, announced in February this year, facilitates staking, borrowing, and lending services, with guidance issued to manage risks. These policies ensure that Web 3.0 participants operate under consistent rules, facilitating mediation and resolution when issues arise.

Beyond digital assets, our broader policies strengthen Hong Kong as an international financial centre and our country's global financial gateway, as outlined in the 14th Five-Year Plan. Measures like enhancing stock market competitiveness - through the Technology Enterprises Channel, optimising listing rules, and facilitating overseas listings - bolster our platform for resolving financial disputes. Expansions in mutual access schemes, such as Swap Connect enhancements this year, including extended tenors and increased quotas, deepen connectivity. In green and sustainable finance, the Government Sustainable Bond Programme has issued bonds equivalent to $250 billion as of November this year, with innovative tokenised issuances.

In conclusion, the Hong Kong Government's policy measures are meticulously crafted to harmonise standards in Web 3.0 and digital assets, positioning our city as a premier dispute resolver. By prioritising investor protection, regulatory clarity, and international alignment, we create an environment where innovation flourishes without compromising stability. Together, we can ensure Hong Kong remains a beacon of problem-solving in the global arena. Thank you."
HA activates service demand surge special measures,2025-12-19 16:00,2025-12-19 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900497.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The Hospital Authority (HA) announced today (December 19) that public hospitals will activate service demand surge special measures starting Sunday (December 21). The HA anticipates increased service demand at public hospitals during the Christmas and New Year holidays and will closely monitor hospital operations.

The HA Chief Manager (Cluster Performance), Dr Larry Lee, said, ""Public hospitals will implement special measures to cope with increasing service demand for Accident and Emergency Departments (A&Es) and inpatient services, including enhanced manpower, bed capacity, and laboratory testing services for influenza and other viruses. Hospital command centres will co-ordinate discharge procedures and support arrangements for admissions, discharges and transfers to ensure that patients receive timely and appropriate treatment and that beds are available for new admissions. Also, public hospitals will reduce medical elective admissions after long holidays and open extra sessions for fractured hip surgeries during long holidays as and when necessary. Meanwhile, Community Geriatric Assessment Teams will strengthen support for residential care homes for the elderly, such as increasing visits, to reduce pressure on A&E attendance and unnecessary hospitalisation.""

The HA will implement special refund arrangements in the A&Es during the service demand surge period to provide stable patients with flexibility in choosing alternative medical care. While waiting for medical consultation at A&Es, patients who wish to seek treatment at other healthcare institutions can raise a refund request for the A&E charges directly from staff on duty at the registration counter. ""HA Go"" members may also submit refund applications through the HA mobile app ""HA Go"". This arrangement applies only to patients who have not been attended to by doctors, and applications must be made within 24 hours of registration. Eligible applicants will receive the refund in approximately one month by cheque by mail, credit card or electronic wallet. The special refund arrangements will be implemented until December 31, which will be replaced by the A&E refund arrangement under the Public Healthcare Fees and Charges Reform on January 1, 2026.

  Family Medicine Outpatient Services have been enhanced in order to cope with the service needs from members of the public and to alleviate the service pressure on A&Es during the Christmas long holidays. A total of 18 Family Medicine Clinics (FMCs) will provide public holiday FMC services during the Christmas holidays (December 25 and 26) (see table below). Patients may book an appointment either through the telephone appointment system or the ""Book FMC"" function of the ""HA Go"" mobile app.

The Chinese Medicine Clinics cum Training and Research Centres (CMCTRs) located in the 18 districts will also enhance government-subsidised Chinese medicine outpatient services on December 24, 27 and 29 to meet public demand. Patients may make an appointment either by telephone during service hours or through the ""18 CM Clinics"" mobile app (applicable to patients who have registered for 18 CMCTRs service). Please refer to the latest information on Chinese medicine services on the HA CMK website (cmk.ha.org.hk/christmas-2025).

The HA urges non-emergency patients to avoid using A&E services and instead seek treatment at FMCs, private doctors or 24-hour outpatient services at private hospitals to reduce pressure on public hospital A&Es. Members of the public can visit the Health Bureau (HHB)'s Primary Care Directory (www.pcdirectory.gov.hk). The HHB has also collated information of private hospitals, healthcare facilities, family doctors and Chinese medicine clinics that will be in operation during the 2025 Christmas and 2026 New Year holidays across the city. The information (including addresses, phone numbers and operation hours) of the relevant hospitals and clinics have been uploaded to the online portal (www.map.gov.hk/gm/s/hhbclinic/all?lg=en) for public reference in collaboration with the Spatial Data Office of the Development Bureau and the Lands Department.

As Hong Kong is currently in the influenza season, the HA reminds the public to maintain personal and environmental hygiene during the holidays to prevent disease transmission. People with respiratory symptoms should wear masks and seek medical attention promptly. Eligible persons, particularly those in high-risk groups, should get vaccinated early for seasonal influenza and COVID-19 to reduce the chance of infection for themselves and their family members, as well as to reduce the risk of critical illness and death after infection.

Grading of beach water quality released,2025-12-19 16:00,2025-12-19 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900357.htm,"âThe Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (December 19) released the latest grading of water quality for six gazetted beaches that are open all year round for swimming.

Four beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1), and two as Fair (Grade 2).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Golden Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Silverstrand Beach




Grade 2 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Lido Beach




  Compared with the grading released last week, there was no change in the grading for these beaches.

Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast)."

「牛潭尾地區發展」屬於《環評條例》附表3的指定工程項目覆蓋面積超過50公頃的市區發展工程項目或重建工程項目。發展項目包括附表2的指定工程項目，須就其建造和營運取得環境許可證，包括新區域幹道和部分牛潭尾排水道活化及河道改道工程。

土拓署根據《環評條例》於二○二五年十月六日至十一月四日期間將該環評報告公開予公眾查閱。於公眾查閱期間，環保署共收到七份公眾意見。環境諮詢委員會（環諮會）轄下的環評小組於二○二五年十二月五日的會議詳細討論該環評報告及主要的公眾意見。其後，環諮會於二○二五年十二月十一日的會議上，一致通過建議環保署有條件批准該環評報告。

環保署發言人表示，環保署署長認為該工程項目透過實施環評報告建議的緩解措施，能為當區帶來多項環境效益，包括處理現時項目範圍內零散及雜亂的棕地作業所產生的不良環境影響，以提升土地使用效率和改善區內整體環境；另外，透過擴闊及活化牛潭尾排水道成為一條多功能藍綠走廊，可提升項目範圍內及附近的生態價值及功能。此外，工程項目透過濕地補償，連接附近獨立的濕地，能提高整體生態價值。

發言人強調，環保署已全面考慮相關環評研究概要和《環境影響評估程序的技術備忘錄》的要求、於公眾查閱期間由公眾提出有關環境及生態影響的意見、環保團體就該環評報告提出的建議及數據，包括由世界自然（香港）基金會發表的《香港生物多樣性現狀2025》研究報告、土拓署在環諮會會議上的回應，以及環諮會提出的意見及建議批准該環評報告的條件。環保署最終決定有條件批准該份環評報告。

批准條件主要包括要求土拓署：
（i）按照環評報告的建議，在建造工程開展前不少於三個月，就濕地補償向環保署署長提交詳細的《生境創造及管理計劃》，以供批准，並諮詢漁農自然護理署（漁護署）；
（ii）在建造工程開展前不少於三個月向環保署署長提交牛潭尾排水道《生態優化措施設計實施計劃》，以供批准，並諮詢相關政府部門（包括漁護署、渠務署及規劃署）；
（iii）設立一個具代表性的環境委員會，負責就《生境創造及管理計劃》及《生態優化措施設計實施計劃》的制定，及根據環評報告及已獲批准的上述兩份計劃內建議的生態緩解／優化措施的實施成效，提供專業及持份者意見；以及
（iv）在建造工程開展前，向環保署署長提交工程項目範圍內建築物及隔音屏障的《鳥類友善設計指引》。

此外，土拓署須檢視各項計劃的實施進度、環境監測結果及生態緩解／優化措施的成效。環保署會繼續與相關政府部門緊密聯繫，跟進上述各項批准條件。

Local undergraduate students are welcome to apply.

In the 2025 Policy Address, the Chief Executive emphasised that the Government would continue to promote youth development. This includes providing more opportunities for young people to participate in the internships of international organisations and attend international conferences, in order to broaden their international horizons and cultivate a holistic outlook. The HYAB - United Nations Volunteer Internship Programme provides local undergraduate students with valuable opportunities to undertake six-month volunteer internships in the overseas field units of various United Nations (UN) agencies. Interns will be able to develop their personal capacities and gain insights into global issues, as well as contribute to the international community as Chinese youth volunteers. So far, around 150 students have participated in the Programme. The selected university students for the Programme in 2025 undertook internships in UN agencies located in different countries, including the UN Development Programme, the UN Children's Fund, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN. By participating in international affairs, they contributed their expertise and acquired valuable work experience in international organisations.

The new round of the Programme will offer a total of 20 internship placements in different UN agencies located in the Belt and Road region, including Kazakhstan, Laos, Nepal, Thailand, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. The volunteer internships will cover specific areas, such as health and education, environment and innovation management, and will run from July to December 2026. Applicants should be full-time undergraduate students of local universities. The HYAB will provide full funding, including round-trip air tickets and monthly living allowances, and offer suitable pre-departure training for participants in collaboration with the AVS.

Details of the Programme are available on the designated webpage (www.avs.org.hk/eng/UNV). Interested young people should submit applications by noon on January 16, 2026."

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Customs officers intercepted a 62-year-old incoming female passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point yesterday (December 18), and seized 381 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $1,500 and a duty potential of about $1,200 from her. She was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

  An EPD spokesman said the Programme is limited to the recycling of NCTs, and all lighting, plastic stands, decorations and tape on the NCTs should be removed before delivery to facilitate the subsequent recycling processes. Artificial Christmas trees and other festival decorations can be kept for reuse to help reduce waste and conserve resources, while small potted plants such as poinsettias can be replanted.

  An e-certificate will be issued to the participants who deliver NCTs to the CCP or the Recycling Stations for recycling. Participants will also receive a gift upon delivery of NCTs to the Recycling Stations while stocks last. For details of the NCTs Recycling Programme, please visit the Hong Kong Waste Reduction website at www.wastereduction.gov.hk/en-hk/article/2025-26-natural-christmas-trees-recycling-programme.

  The EPD also welcomes other organisations and associations to provide recycling services for NCTs to help the public and C&I organisations participate and enhance waste reduction efforts for all."
